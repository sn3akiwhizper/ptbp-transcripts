0	3180	Salutations, my little honeybees.
3180	6980	It's your beekeeper, Beastie Wolf, the dog.
6980	9780	I'm here to protect you at all costs
9780	11380	while getting a little taste
11380	15260	of that sweet, sticky honey every now and then.
15260	18100	I can't wait to make some toilet wine
18100	20220	with y'all's sweet syrup.
20220	25220	I am buzzin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP,
26160	29700	the only radio station located
29700	33180	in a trash hive of my own making.
33180	35140	What's that sound?
35140	36380	Is it the mail truck?
36380	39460	They're saying I got a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby.
39460	43660	This fine edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Bee.
43660	45020	Very nice.
45020	48540	Who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
48540	51840	proving that even the busiest bees can take time
51840	55240	to make this old Wolfie feel something again.
55240	56640	They right.
56640	59040	Have you seen the yellow sub?
59040	61840	Have you felt its honey mustard contours
61840	66280	dripping around the edges of that braised brain of yours,
66280	70000	encased in a sun-toasted bread of skin and bone?
70000	73040	The sponge monkey elders assure you
73040	75840	those are olives, not eyes.
75840	78080	And if you haven't seen the yellow sign,
78080	81320	I mean sub, you will soon.
81720	86080	Damn, Bee, don't threaten to dog the wolf with a good time.
86080	89680	You're talking about toast, you're talking about mustard,
89680	94160	and braising, and goddamn, I am fucking pumped
94160	97900	for whatever the hell it is you are talking about.
97900	101520	If you wanna write up something for your honey wolf to howl,
101520	105520	tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,
105520	108880	or write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts
108880	113240	and let my producer know at pretendingpod at gmail.com.
113240	116720	And if you're already wrist-deep in the interwebs,
116720	119660	go ahead and share the trailer for season one
119660	121760	of Pretending to Be People.
121760	125520	Share it on the mountain, share it over the hills,
125520	127820	share it everywhere.
127820	132120	Jesus Christ wouldn't have been so him-damn-bored.
132120	133720	God damn it, Zach.
133720	137140	If he had access to all this sweet content
137140	141740	in the show notes, and if that ain't the truth,
141740	144100	then this ain't the news.
144100	148020	Last time, we lost a few dear friends.
148020	150580	Please bow your heads and take a moment
150580	153920	to reflect on the lives of Jimmy Sanders,
153920	157140	Carmen the Possum, Harry Klinker,
157140	160220	Rusty the Distinguished Gray Dog,
160220	164000	Professor Horace Green, and the decapitated head
164000	167420	of preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard.
169240	171280	Damn, I miss all them.
171280	173520	Then the ball that is John Lee Pettymore
173520	176280	summoned Planet Juggernaut and friends
176280	181280	to fight alongside the Overseer against Rose Mary
182160	186040	in this gigantopumpathy-pipicus.
186040	189740	Taking us to the top of round one is Dragon in 3
189740	193360	with What Kind of World Are You Living In?
193360	198360	["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]
223360	228360	["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]
232720	236000	Whoa, whoa, everybody, welcome.
236000	241000	My name is Nick Nichols and I am here with my brother, Nick.
241200	242040	Wait.
244040	245320	I forgot my name.
245320	247380	I'm Nick, you're Nick.
247380	251600	We're all Nick for Nichols, and welcome.
251600	254520	We are here in, oh my goodness,
254520	257120	where the fuck are we, Nick?
257120	261000	I don't seem to know, but it is terrifying me to my core.
261000	262540	I am scared.
262540	264440	Look at that big fucker on the left.
264440	267480	And we've got, thankfully, bringing us home,
267480	269160	giving us some shelter with it,
269160	273880	I don't know, that hurts, is Planet Juggernaut.
273880	278400	Thanks, Nick, I'm just glad to be here.
278440	282680	I'm really excited to start mixing it up again.
282680	287440	Gotta admit, this is a little fancier than this crap pit,
287440	290640	but I think I can still be a scrapper.
290640	294200	Hope I can put on a good show for you guys.
296400	297900	Back to you, Dick and Nick.
301480	303760	Dick is dead.
303760	305320	Nick and Nick Nichols here,
305360	310200	and we are gonna go now to our correspondent.
310200	311880	I see him, he's running a buck.
311880	315680	He just came down in a full Technicolor flash
315680	317120	of light over there.
317120	319320	He is crying on the ground.
319320	322160	It's Jeremiah Jones Johnson.
322160	325800	Let's go with him now and see what's going on.
325800	328160	What do you think about that, Nick?
328160	330400	As before, I just always love to hear
330400	332380	my boy Jeremiah say stuff.
335480	339280	Hello, it's Jeremiah Jones Johnson here,
339280	342680	and I don't know where the fuck he is,
342680	347000	but we're gonna try to find out now.
347000	350000	And he walks over and sees a few other people
350000	352500	who've just been seemingly teleported
352500	354320	into this plane of existence,
354320	357820	three individuals who have just made their way
357820	361840	onto this plane, standing on the ground made of light.
363320	364600	What's your name?
364760	365960	I'm Brad.
365960	369000	Hey, Brad, where are we?
370000	372560	It's the dark world.
373440	375800	I gather it's the dark world.
375800	377920	Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
377920	382040	And he pulls a T-shirt out from behind his back
382040	383280	and hands it to you.
385160	388280	Oh, sweet, hell yeah, thanks, Jeremiah.
388280	393280	And you, you're, what's your name, sir?
393560	398280	My name is Patrick Star, and, wait, is that?
398280	403280	Is that the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?
406120	406960	Okay.
410480	412840	Well, let's take it down to Jeremiah Jones Johnson
412840	413920	for our new game.
413920	416900	Is it the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?
418120	420640	My name is Patrick Star, and I disagree.
420640	421820	We're not in the dark place.
421820	424980	This is clearly heaven, and that's God,
424980	428420	and I, for one, and I'm gonna go rush up and meet him.
428420	430860	Okay, oh, and he's gone.
430860	432580	He's running full armed, like,
432580	435260	at the can't jump ropypicus.
435260	440260	Okay, and Patrick Star runs directly toward one of the legs
440700	445260	of this enormous, shadowy, dripping creature
445260	449380	and disappears into it like a open door
449380	452020	with only darkness on the other side of it,
452020	455420	and he is no longer visible to the human eye
455420	457580	or any other eyes.
457580	461900	And this third person, who are you?
461900	464780	Hey, you can just call me Jerry.
466620	467840	Oh, hey, Jerry.
469260	471580	Cool voice, what's your deal, man?
472620	477300	My grandson brought me up to the city to go see the games,
477300	480380	and well, this ain't the city.
480380	481220	No, it's not.
481220	482660	Back to you, Mick and Nick.
482660	487500	Oh, thank you so much there, Jeremiah Jones Johnson.
487500	489580	Jones, because I called you Jones Johnson
489580	490980	because you called yourself Johnson.
490980	492380	Somebody else called you Johnson,
492380	493660	so we're good with all of it.
493660	495700	Jeremiah Jones Johnson corresponding on the field.
495700	496540	Thank you so much.
496540	498140	Nick Nichols, what do you think about all that?
498140	500860	You know, I've said it a thousand times.
500860	502900	Every time Jeremiah says things,
502900	506240	I light up with a joy that just cannot be found
506240	508640	in any other place in my life.
508640	509480	What?
513080	515640	Let's go down to the field and see what happens.
515640	519680	This massive, lumbering, shadowy, dripping creature
519680	522800	that we've been calling the Gigant Umbropithecus
522800	526960	because someone in the circle of knowledge called it that,
526960	531960	grabs out with one of its enormous, massive arms now,
532240	537240	so large that it can hold onto the illuminated pipe
538040	541400	that is hanging in the sky with its hand.
541400	546080	Once trapped inside this eternal treadmill prison,
546080	550640	it can now hold the entirety of its former...
552160	553680	Cage.
553680	557720	Thank you, cage, within its grasp.
557760	562560	It rips and throws this toilet paper holder
562560	564600	with light shining out through the middle of it,
564600	568160	throws this thing behind it as its other hand
568160	573160	reaches up and touches the sky.
573200	575000	It's gonna testify.
577520	579120	It's up in this spot.
579120	580760	Luke, how do you think it looks?
581640	582480	Fuck.
582480	583800	That's right, extra fly.
583800	584640	Extra fly.
584800	586880	It touches...
589520	593880	It touches the dark sky above,
593880	598880	which immediately breaks and waves begin to form
599240	603520	an ocean of black ichor.
603520	608520	It is moving like dark, lagoon-y waters.
608840	613160	So gravity, seemingly, up there is opposite
613160	615280	of the gravity that you're on.
616120	617080	Does that sound cool?
617080	617920	Yeah.
617920	619400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
619400	620240	Gravity.
620240	622280	A dark sky sea of endless blackness.
622280	624600	A dark-sized ski of endless darkness.
624600	625440	That's right, yeah.
625440	626760	Stark ski and hutch.
632000	633320	Word association.
637880	639720	Yeah, kids, if you wanna know how to be funny,
639720	642920	just remember what sounds sound like other sounds.
642920	646200	Yeah, it works 100%.
646200	649920	And blurt that out almost compulsively
649920	652040	and you'll be just like your best friends,
652040	653760	the boys at PDBP.
657600	658440	PDBP.
659560	661960	Everyone's best friend, PDBP.
661960	666960	Rose M-A-R-Y looks at this new set of issues.
667280	669840	She's coming straight for Planet Juggernaut.
669840	671720	Two of her metal tendrils slam down
671760	674160	into the illuminated ground below her
674160	679160	and she flings herself toward this enormous, robust sphere,
679240	681720	a larger version of what controls her.
681720	683680	And the other two tendrils are going to try
683680	686920	to penetrate the armor of Planet Juggernaut.
686920	688160	Does he get a reaction?
688160	689000	A hundred.
690000	691640	Laser eyes.
691640	695440	Fuck yes, all right, let's roll.
697440	699800	Mother fucking shit.
699800	700680	What did you roll?
700680	703480	I rolled a 66, it's a critical something.
703480	705920	It's a critical something.
705920	709240	I don't know Juggernaut stats, I don't have Mandy.
709240	711200	Would they be in the big thing of...
711200	714800	Much like Nick Cage, you don't have Mandy.
717240	718880	Fuck, no, cut all that.
723960	726240	Why don't you have your stats?
726240	729040	Dude, I don't know where our giant robot stats are.
729040	732920	Thomas, they probably don't exist anywhere.
732920	736200	I just wrote them on a piece of paper for you one day,
736200	737040	like years ago.
737040	739760	I do explicitly remember you just jotting them down
739760	742080	on like a scratch piece of paper and we used that.
742080	744800	It was a scratch piece of paper, why don't you have it?
744800	747640	I'll look for it in the box real quick.
747640	749520	He had real good stats.
749520	753000	Let me pull up the pulp Cthulhu rules.
753000	754880	I'm pretty sure that's what I pulled it from.
754880	755920	Yeah, because I remember you based it
755920	757520	on something you found.
760040	761720	Found pulp Cthulhu.
761720	766440	Robots tend to come in two varieties, giant and killer.
768720	771640	Laser beam, 80%.
771640	772480	Hell yeah.
772480	773880	Critical success.
773880	775000	Nice.
775000	779360	Damage 2D10, so roll 4D10.
779360	780200	Hell yeah.
781200	784120	10 and two for the first ones,
784120	786120	10 and two again for the second ones.
786120	787200	Whoa.
787200	788520	Damn.
788560	789400	That's wild.
789400	791800	24 points of damage.
791800	793040	God's here guys.
798080	803080	Describe how these lasers absolutely wreck shop
803120	805840	taking over half of Rosemary's hit points.
805840	807240	She was coming at him.
807240	808280	How was she coming at him?
808280	811760	She flinged herself at this planet juggernaut
811760	814280	with two metal tendrils shoved into the ground
814280	817800	and the other two are in attack mode
817800	820360	trying to stab into the planet juggernaut.
820360	823040	Okay, so with surprising swiftness,
823040	826680	planet juggernaut's eyes kind of swing around
826680	828560	and lock onto Rosemary.
828560	832320	They flash red, two beams come out of either eye
832320	835360	and you see the tip of the tendrils
835360	836720	that are like about to attack them
836720	839760	just kind of slice clean off.
839760	843040	And so he destroys like half of her body, he said.
843040	844760	Yeah, yeah.
844760	848240	So it's exactly like a dope fucking samurai movie
848240	851240	where you see the lasers seemingly
851240	852400	go right through her middle,
852400	853960	but nothing happens for a second.
853960	857880	And then the bottom half just slides away,
857880	861520	but you can still see like anger actively on her face,
861520	864200	but it's more like annoyance as she begins
864200	867440	to just climb out of this Rosemary like shell.
872320	873280	Keith, it's your turn.
873280	876360	Am I on planet juggernaut or am I on the ground?
876360	878560	You are in a very dark building.
878560	879800	Oh, that Keith.
879800	881120	That Keith.
881120	883840	Yeah, there's a few, I think.
883840	887320	Keith, I guess, what has Don done to me?
887320	891040	You are being held by the caller by Don D. Pettymore
891040	893400	and he is angrily yelling at you
893400	896360	because he has just seemingly failed.
896360	898880	His whole mission was getting to this phone
898880	901520	and then he seems disappointed by the results.
901560	903880	Hey man, what's your problem?
903880	904920	What's going on?
907280	908880	It's all good in here.
911520	914040	I love this because I feel like I'm shaking you.
915800	917240	I'm just like limply like.
922400	923240	For listeners at home,
923240	926520	Luke just did the thing that like inflatable men do
926520	929080	in front of big car dealerships.
929120	931640	More like Muppets do when they're excited.
934640	939640	But your voice belies the extreme emotion of the situation.
940480	945320	Hey man, the phone, what is it?
945320	946560	They didn't say anything to me.
946560	948360	It's all, none of this means anything.
948360	951400	Don't you, why don't you fucking understand?
951400	953560	Well, let me give it a try.
953560	956600	Give it to me, give it to me.
956680	960240	Don D. Pettymore like kind of immediately stops
961320	965480	and just drops you but he doesn't give you the phone
965480	967080	but he kind of walks away from you.
967080	968760	Can I get up and go to the phone?
969720	970560	Yeah, sure.
970560	971380	I get up and go to the phone.
971380	972220	Yeah.
974220	977040	I pick it up.
977040	980000	I'm like blindly feeling around for it
980000	980840	because I can't say anything.
980840	981680	There it is, yeah.
981680	983320	And you blew the candle out.
987160	990200	So go ahead and roll on whether or not
990200	992280	you can find this phone this turn.
992280	993480	Just a 50-50.
995280	996400	No, roll luck.
998240	1000880	17, I pass.
1000880	1003320	And so you grab onto this phone
1003320	1005600	and when you lift it to your ear, you hear.
1008820	1012540	Hello, this is Keith, who's this?
1017000	1018420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1023520	1025960	Roll intelligence.
1030240	1031080	I fail.
1032140	1032980	Shocker.
1041180	1043400	What is Keith's intelligence?
1043400	1044240	50.
1044240	1045080	All right.
1045080	1047440	Not bad, I got a 63 on a 50.
1047440	1049880	You're not really able to put together
1049880	1053040	what you recognize this sound from
1053040	1056040	but you know that it sounds familiar.
1056040	1058080	Hmm, Don, this sounds familiar.
1058080	1061320	I'm gonna maybe just keep listening to it for a second
1061320	1064120	and maybe in just a little bit I'll be able to,
1064120	1065040	it'll come to me.
1065040	1066600	And Don's in the corner like,
1066600	1069320	the fucking piece of shit thinks he's better than me,
1069320	1070400	thinks he can use the phone.
1070400	1072760	I'm the one who came down here to get the fucking phone
1072760	1075300	but I'm not talking to anyone in particular.
1076320	1079200	I grab the phone, like the base of the phone
1079200	1080980	and I lay back down on the ground
1080980	1083720	and just like hold the receiver up to my ear
1083720	1085040	and keep listening to it.
1089520	1092520	Just waiting for the internet company to get back to you.
1096580	1100180	Back on the illuminated battlefield,
1100180	1102620	creatures appear out of nowhere
1102620	1106220	in between the dark oozing ocean above you
1106220	1109500	and the illuminated land below you.
1109500	1111540	Above you and below you, what did I say?
1112460	1115540	Between the, whatever.
1115540	1116380	And,
1120220	1122380	Who the fucking gives a shit?
1122380	1125460	Nobody cares, nobody's listening anymore.
1125460	1127480	This nerd shit doesn't matter.
1127480	1131480	This isn't, none of this is real.
1133880	1136680	Guys, we only had four listens on the last episode
1136680	1138680	which means one of us didn't listen to it.
1138680	1143680	Who gives a flying fuck?
1145160	1149280	Between the dark, mysterious choppy waters above you
1149280	1153440	and the bright light shining up from below,
1153440	1156920	in this air of nothingness in between,
1158120	1162720	massive creatures with gaunt frames
1162720	1167720	in black suits with translucent skin fall to the ground.
1169120	1171880	And as they do, they are surrounding
1171880	1176840	this luminous land liturgy that is worshiping the overseer.
1176840	1180480	They look directly at this floating man,
1180480	1185480	his arms out with his dark robes and his cowboy hat.
1187760	1189560	And in unison, they all say,
1189560	1194560	Hello, subject 1522518195518, we found you.
1198080	1199840	Please come with us.
1199840	1204000	And they all reach out their hands simultaneously.
1204000	1205840	It's the overseer's turn.
1205840	1206920	Clark, go ahead and roll
1206920	1209200	for the alternate version of yourself.
1209200	1211360	Go ahead and roll for Clark Old.
1211360	1212760	Okay, what am I rolling?
1212760	1215400	Just up and down, D100.
1218480	1220800	It's an 11.
1220800	1224840	Oh, it's a critical.
1224840	1227000	I'm showing the camera to the dice.
1227000	1229080	It is a straight up 11.
1229080	1231880	You see his arms move out.
1231880	1234840	His right arm is pulled to one side by one of them.
1234840	1238000	His left hand is pulled to the side by another
1238000	1239200	with their minds.
1239200	1242600	His legs are held down by two of the others.
1242600	1245480	You see he's fighting against it.
1245560	1248320	But one of them is trying to get a hold of his head.
1248320	1253120	His entire face becomes engulfed in light.
1253120	1258120	And he beams this light at one of these gaunt
1259680	1263000	alien creatures wearing black suit.
1263000	1268000	It's translucent skin pops puss and ooze.
1269720	1274720	Not green, not yellow, just this clear milky slime.
1275320	1280160	Hits the ground in a pile of a black suit covered in...
1280160	1282400	Nope, I'm gonna throw up.
1282400	1284920	The popping of pimples really gets me.
1284920	1286840	That's like fucking disgusting.
1286840	1291800	So, it's like with the beam,
1291800	1294400	he's got fingers on either side of just this
1295600	1298880	volcano eruption of puss.
1298880	1302800	Just comes out, I'm gonna throw up.
1302800	1304880	And then he turns and looks at another one
1304880	1306560	because he critically succeeded.
1306560	1310120	And he does it to a second one, looks at a third one,
1310120	1311160	does it to a third one.
1311160	1314320	There's only two more left on the field.
1314320	1316760	You ever DM so hard you make yourself throw up?
1320720	1324880	Clark Old, they're not Clark Old, just Clark Bishop.
1324880	1325720	It's your turn.
1325720	1327880	Clark, my Clark, our Clark,
1327880	1330040	the Clark we've all come to know and love.
1330080	1334520	He just saw what he thinks that he can become.
1334520	1336400	And he wants to do that.
1336400	1338240	He wants to be that.
1338240	1341200	And so he's just gonna do like he did with Anne Love
1341200	1344360	and try and imitate everything he just saw the overseer do.
1344360	1347120	And he wants to try and make his face turn into bright light
1347120	1349560	that pops translucent beings.
1349560	1351520	Okay, go ahead and roll a natural.
1351520	1352360	The two that popped,
1352360	1353840	are they the ones that have his hands?
1353840	1355640	Yeah, but not physically.
1355640	1356560	Okay, gotcha, gotcha.
1356560	1358120	They were like away from him.
1358120	1360120	They're holding him with that grip
1360120	1364160	that one of them used on Keith Beans earlier in the show.
1364160	1367680	And Marvin Glass used on Clark Bishop at one point in time
1367680	1370640	where they can physically grab you from further away.
1370640	1372760	Like Darth Vader, I like Star Wars.
1372760	1374920	I like Star Wars a lot.
1374920	1378160	Yeah, I'm popping the other two, trying to.
1381000	1384640	And it's a pass, a 28 on a 63.
1384640	1388480	They rolled a 17 earlier against Clark Gold
1388480	1390960	and that roll carries over to yours,
1390960	1392280	which means that you succeed
1392280	1394280	in being able to do this to one of them.
1394280	1398000	Please, can you describe it so I don't gak in my own throat?
1400400	1402400	As I said, he's imitating what he had seen.
1402400	1404360	He doesn't know exact,
1404360	1409360	he saw the concentration that Clark Gold exuded
1410480	1412760	and that he just tries to mimic that.
1412760	1415600	He just tries to scrunch his face up a little bit,
1415600	1418600	clear his mind as much as possible and just picture light.
1418600	1419640	He just wants to picture light.
1419640	1421720	He doesn't know a hundred percent if it's gonna work,
1421720	1424180	but it kind of did that last time with the blood thing.
1424180	1427960	And he thinks that maybe, I don't, and his head,
1427960	1431380	just like a light bulb turning on illuminates
1431380	1433680	and it kind of startles him even
1433680	1437640	as there's now a bunch of light flooded the area around him.
1437640	1439880	And he just directs it all as much as he can
1439880	1440840	into one of them.
1440840	1444200	And as though being squeezed on both sides,
1444200	1448040	goo erupts off the top of one of these things,
1448040	1451320	popping its head, fully volcanoing and splashing outward,
1451320	1454320	maybe probably hitting some of the people in the circle
1454320	1457940	with some pretty awful, pretty awful awful.
1457940	1458840	Awful awful.
1458840	1460840	It's this guy named Zach who's in the crowd
1460840	1463080	and it's like really warm and he can feel it.
1463080	1464200	Gets in his mouth a little.
1464200	1465480	Yeah. Gets in his mouth.
1465480	1466320	Oh!
1467840	1469480	Zach falls to his knees,
1469520	1471480	begins throwing up on the ground
1471480	1475280	and gets trampled by some of the other chanting people.
1476800	1480360	Clark is also, he's like proud of himself
1480360	1484240	and he gives a thumbs up to Clark Old and a smile.
1484240	1486960	Like, I did good, dad, huh?
1488760	1491080	At this moment, you see all the anger
1491080	1495600	that had come from Clark Old previously dissipates
1495600	1499640	and he looks at you with this,
1499640	1504360	that moment when a father realizes-
1504360	1505200	TFW.
1508900	1510400	I thought you said DFW and I was like-
1510400	1511400	Like Dallas, Fort Worth?
1511400	1512920	The pride that all fathers have
1512920	1517120	in the Dallas International Airport shines on his face.
1517120	1519520	Dad's face when- No, he looks at you and it's-
1519520	1520360	Oh!
1524200	1525040	Yeah.
1526560	1531040	So what's the prevailing jiff of someone becoming,
1531040	1533440	oh yeah, it's the guy in the woods with the,
1534800	1535640	is it Grizzly Adams?
1535640	1537120	That's what I was thinking of too.
1538320	1539720	Just the single head nod.
1539720	1540560	It's not Grizzly Adams.
1540560	1544360	It's not Grizzly Adams, but it's the guy in the woods.
1544360	1545840	Is it Jeremiah Johnson?
1545840	1547920	No, it's something else.
1547920	1549120	Jeremiah Johnson.
1549120	1550760	Jeremiah Johnson- The nodding man?
1550760	1552320	On the field reporting.
1552320	1553160	Yeah, the nodding man.
1553240	1554800	Robert Redford.
1554800	1555640	No, it's not.
1555640	1556480	What?
1556480	1557320	Is it not?
1557320	1558160	No, it's not.
1558160	1559000	I found it though.
1559000	1560600	Nodding man, jiff.
1560600	1561960	I sent it to the Discord.
1561960	1563280	Origin.
1563280	1565040	Yeah, but I'm looking for who it is.
1565040	1566520	It is Jeremiah Johnson.
1566520	1567360	Yeah.
1567360	1568200	That is-
1568200	1570320	This man is actually Robert Redford.
1570320	1571760	Dude, it is Robert Redford.
1571760	1573560	Yeah, that's what I was saying.
1573560	1575880	Wait, no, Robert Redford is Jeremiah Johnson,
1575880	1578360	but that nodding man is not Robert Redford.
1578360	1579200	Oh, okay.
1579200	1580040	That's what I was thinking.
1580040	1580960	Oh.
1580960	1581800	Who is this then?
1581800	1582620	I don't think.
1583020	1583860	It doesn't look like-
1583860	1586300	It's a gif of Robert Redford playing titular role
1586300	1588380	of the 1972 film, Jeremiah Johnson.
1588380	1591580	Dude, he looks so thick in that movie.
1591580	1592420	Weird.
1592420	1593900	Yeah, that doesn't really look like him.
1593900	1594740	It's wild.
1594740	1595940	I love that there's a lot that just says this is-
1595940	1597260	He's an ugly motherfucker.
1597260	1601300	That just say Zach Galifianakis is this man,
1601300	1603340	when it's clearly from the 70s.
1603340	1604860	Yeah.
1604860	1606980	Dude, he was like a heartthrob though, like-
1606980	1608540	What is he holding in that gif?
1608540	1610460	What the fuck?
1610460	1611300	You know-
1611300	1612140	A rifle.
1612740	1614220	There are shots of him in that movie
1614220	1616260	where he doesn't look like he does in that gif.
1616260	1618180	He's holding it to the side.
1618180	1619900	Yeah, every other picture of him in the movie
1619900	1621980	looks like Robert Redford when you pull it up.
1621980	1623180	Exactly.
1623180	1625460	Only this one looks like Zach Galifianakis.
1625460	1626780	It's really fucking weird.
1630700	1631780	Okay.
1631780	1635220	He looks at you like Robert Redford and Jeremiah Johnson
1636180	1640380	and just slowly gives you that slight smile and head nod.
1640380	1642540	And that feels real good to Clark.
1642540	1643380	Don.
1643380	1647340	Does Don hear New Commotion from outside?
1647340	1648180	Oh yeah, dude.
1648180	1649020	Or what's the building?
1649020	1650940	I didn't know if the building is like sound insulated
1650940	1652060	or some weird shit.
1652060	1654780	It is, but just enough to where you can hear
1654780	1657700	New Sound Commotion from outside.
1657700	1660820	New Sound Commotion is my favorite band for teenagers.
1662260	1663980	Teenagers.
1663980	1665860	With the hit single New Sound Commotion
1665860	1668340	on the new debut album, Hit Sound Commotion.
1668340	1669500	New Sound Commotion.
1669500	1671460	Hit Sound Commotion.
1671460	1673260	Rocking like the ocean.
1674580	1676660	Is it above you or below you?
1676660	1679580	I'm like, hey boy, are they, can you speak to them?
1680500	1681340	Are you talking?
1686780	1688460	Is that what Keith is doing right now?
1688460	1689660	Yeah, into the phone.
1690620	1691780	Jesus Christ.
1692980	1693820	Oh God.
1693860	1695700	I don't fucking know.
1698620	1701420	As he says that, you hear the same noise that you heard
1701420	1703260	on the other end of the telephone.
1703260	1708260	That's like, this noise comes from outside.
1708420	1709260	You hear it.
1709260	1711020	So I think when I hear that noise,
1711020	1712980	it'll like click in my head and I'll be like,
1712980	1716580	maybe they're here to help and I'll sprint downstairs.
1716580	1719460	Jon, it's Ball's turn.
1719460	1722220	Ball, while Mary has been caught off guard
1722220	1725300	by Planet Juggernaut, or is at least, you know.
1725300	1726420	Caught off guard.
1726420	1727940	Yes, sliced in half.
1730020	1734300	As Mary Ball and like Octopus is like moving out
1734300	1739300	of Mary body, Jon Ball, just in pure tiny silver form,
1739660	1741900	whips at her as hard as he can,
1741900	1745260	is gonna try to just knock her on her ass,
1745260	1746980	basically, on her ball.
1746980	1748260	A ball on ball.
1748260	1749100	This is dope.
1750060	1753020	All right, let's tangle some wires.
1753020	1755060	What should we roll for this?
1755060	1756540	Oh yeah, roll ball.
1758140	1760180	Get the Pulp Cthulhu ball stats.
1761740	1763140	Roll a natural.
1763140	1763980	Okay.
1765180	1766740	80, fail.
1766740	1769060	75, pass.
1769060	1773020	The ball of Jon Lee Pettymore lunges at the ball
1773020	1776940	that is pulling itself out of the top half of the body
1776980	1780900	of Rose M-A-R-Y, Rosemary.
1780900	1784540	The clean cut across the leather jacket
1784540	1789340	and white t-shirt of Rosemary is dripping with blood
1789340	1791740	and you see as if sheet metal
1791740	1795780	has been completely sliced clean.
1795780	1799100	It's like a layer of t-shirt that is red,
1799100	1802340	stained with blood, and then there's skin,
1802340	1805460	and then there's this metal, and then there's more skin,
1805500	1807740	and then there's reinforced metal,
1807740	1812740	and then inside you just see these lengthy intestines
1813220	1817580	spill out onto the illuminated land below.
1817580	1822460	I don't, what if she keeps the top half of Rosemary
1822460	1824260	and then it's a walking eye situation
1824260	1826740	but with an angry Rosemary torso
1826740	1829140	just dripping its intestines all over the place?
1829140	1832420	There aren't a lot of moments in this show
1832420	1835060	that make me as happy as the one
1835060	1837340	that you've just suggested now.
1838420	1840620	Thomas, 10 luck.
1840620	1841540	Nice.
1841540	1844460	And as you come at her, she kind of,
1845460	1850020	she flips up to where you just barrel
1850020	1853020	into the bottom half of Rosemary
1853020	1857100	and your ball disappears up into the guts
1857100	1861300	of Rosemary's body and you are stuck inside
1861300	1863420	of this human goop.
1863420	1864260	That's dope.
1864260	1867300	I came from the muck and I'm stuck in the ball's guts.
1867300	1868140	Oh no.
1868140	1870980	I thought I'd get it.
1870980	1871980	Back to the lab again.
1871980	1872820	Yeah.
1875140	1880140	And now we're gonna go to our newly minted old characters.
1880340	1883860	They haven't been around since episode 46.
1883860	1888740	It is the scrap pit versions of Keith, Clark,
1888740	1892100	and then John, who is inside Planet Juggernaut.
1892100	1893420	So we'll start with Keith.
1893420	1895140	It is Keith's turn.
1895140	1896020	Whoo!
1896020	1901020	Keith just jumps with his pneumatic legs,
1901820	1904340	jumps right at Mary,
1904340	1909060	and starts shooting his freezing liquid
1909060	1914060	and is aiming his legs to just smash into her frozen head.
1915460	1916300	Radical.
1916300	1917140	Or roll.
1917140	1918940	Stankling icicle guts.
1918940	1921820	Either one, depending on my roll.
1923300	1928300	And 19, which I think is a pass.
1928420	1930780	It is, but she uses her
1930780	1931860	No, she doesn't.
1931860	1936180	against John, which was a 75, which was also a pass.
1936180	1941180	You freeze the whole bottom half of Rosemary
1941180	1946180	and as you come down to try to take her on, essentially,
1946780	1951020	she uses the two tendrils that haven't been sliced off
1951020	1954220	to grab onto her frozen bottom half
1954220	1957900	and hold it up like a ice cold shield
1957900	1962900	that your fucking rad feet just boom and shatter
1963620	1967300	and the bottom half of Rosemary just explodes
1967300	1971460	into tiny little icicle pieces all over the ground.
1971460	1974420	Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
1976860	1981140	And for the rest of the combat, I will call you Elsa.
1982420	1983540	Clark Bishop, it's your turn.
1983540	1987100	This Clark had stocked up on a bunch of stuff
1987100	1990140	from a crazy room of providing.
1990140	1993620	And I think I have a sniper rifle still.
1993620	1994460	You do.
1994460	1996380	So I'd like to shoot that sniper rifle
1996380	2001380	aiming at where I think ball resides within Rosemary.
2001460	2004420	I'm tracing the lines of the feet up to a point
2004420	2006180	and I'm just taking aim at that point.
2006180	2007020	Okay, yeah.
2007020	2009020	The ball is actually visible currently,
2009020	2011900	holding itself right above the top of her head.
2011900	2015060	She's still in control of the top half of Rosemary
2015060	2016940	through the spine with one tendril,
2016940	2020940	but the ball itself is like she just got an idea.
2020940	2022980	It is the light bulb right above her head.
2022980	2023860	Oh, okay, cool.
2023860	2025220	That's what I'm aiming for.
2029300	2031380	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2032300	2036700	Uh, that's a 99.
2036700	2038060	Damn.
2038060	2042380	That plays for this version of this Clark.
2042380	2045900	He was not doing great in that fight anyway.
2045900	2047940	He just popped up and was,
2047940	2048780	what the fuck?
2048780	2049620	Poof.
2049620	2052500	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2052500	2056100	This Clark was cursed by death magic and at zero sanity.
2056100	2056940	That's true.
2056940	2057780	Oh yeah.
2057780	2059380	When he reaches back with one hand
2059420	2061500	to grab onto the sniper rifle,
2061500	2064100	his hand just immediately hits the trigger
2064100	2065780	and he doesn't even see it coming
2065780	2068420	because the barrel is right behind his head.
2068420	2071340	The frontal lobe of Clark Bishop
2071340	2074060	flies out the front of his skull.
2074060	2077540	And I mean, his cranium is now shattered
2077540	2079980	into 40 different pieces
2079980	2082500	that then spray out onto the ground.
2082500	2084380	The people who are chanting below
2084380	2088780	look up as this third version of this same person
2089180	2092700	just, and the headless body of Clark Bishop
2092700	2096020	just kind of falls off the side of Planet Juggernaut
2096020	2098420	and hits the ground shoulders first
2098420	2100460	with no head to stop the fall.
2100460	2101300	Damn.
2101300	2106300	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2107460	2108900	Bye bye.
2108900	2109780	That was quick.
2109780	2112700	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
2112700	2114780	If Planet Juggernaut is a horse,
2114780	2118260	then call that man a headless horse man.
2118260	2119900	Oh my God, Nick Nichols.
2119900	2121780	He was riding him and now he's not.
2121780	2124660	My God, your wordplay hasn't suffered one bit
2124660	2127060	in this new hellscape we find ourselves in.
2127060	2128980	I'm so proud of you, my brother.
2128980	2130620	Remembering who I am,
2130620	2133540	I wrote out that I talk without thinking.
2133540	2135340	Moving on, it is.
2137860	2139540	Planet Juggernaut's turn.
2139540	2141980	So Planet Juggernaut has just seen his Clark
2143060	2145080	have his head explode.
2145080	2146180	Yeah, that's a bummer.
2146180	2147420	Correct, yeah.
2148580	2149460	Yep.
2149460	2152660	Yeah, so now Planet Juggernaut is helicoptering
2152660	2155780	from his tiny little Inspector Gadget helicopter blade,
2155780	2158480	zooming full speed at Rosemary.
2158480	2159320	Awesome.
2159320	2163460	And he's got his big Mickey Mouse gloved hands
2163460	2166100	extended forward like he's trying to full on
2166100	2167940	superhero puncher when he gets there.
2167940	2169500	Go ahead and roll.
2169500	2172500	You have a 60% in fight.
2172500	2173980	39.
2173980	2178300	It is still in the same round as her 75,
2178300	2180360	which was a pass from earlier.
2180360	2185360	So two tendrils grab into the luminous land below
2185780	2189460	and backstroke and dodge nimbly out of the way
2189460	2191720	as Planet Juggernaut hits the ground
2191720	2194060	right next to Keith Bishop,
2194060	2197580	who just landed, shattering the frozen bottom half.
2197580	2198420	Clark Bishop.
2198420	2199740	Did I just say Keith Bishop?
2199740	2200900	Keith Bishop.
2200900	2203960	Whoa, fun new wrinkle in the story.
2204960	2208680	If every time we misspoke about character names
2208680	2210600	had to be included in plot canon,
2210600	2213340	then this story would be confusing.
2214560	2216640	Well, we could have a really fun
2216640	2220040	and incestuous filled like prologue
2220040	2222320	where the Beans, the Bishops, and the Pennymores
2222320	2225680	just all get together in like the 1920s.
2227200	2229660	And we're all, there's just so many secret Beans babies
2229660	2231060	littered around contention.
2231420	2234060	It's ready to pop up.
2234060	2236040	Oh man, Beans babies.
2237660	2239380	Collectible Beans babies.
2244220	2245060	Keith Vigna.
2245060	2248220	Keith Vigna was the person whose name I tried to say.
2248220	2253220	And now it is the turn of John Lee Kevinmore, the third,
2253620	2256460	who is face first on the ground,
2256460	2260180	having just been brought here by Planet Juggernaut.
2260180	2262760	Very confused by the situation that's at hand.
2262760	2266180	He was just crushing Wheel of Fortune, not two seconds ago.
2266180	2267980	He fires his gun into the air.
2271980	2275740	All right, that is the end of round one
2275740	2280040	of this other Wild, Wild, Wild Lake combat, Nick Nickles.
2280040	2285040	And first off, we have this enormous beast to our left,
2285760	2290680	throws a weird pipe made of light on the inside behind him
2290680	2292320	and then touches the sky.
2292320	2294400	Oh, he's gonna testify!
2294400	2299400	And the sky above turns into an ocean of blackness.
2300240	2301680	What do you think about that, Nick Nickles?
2301680	2303280	I'd love to go take a dip in that,
2303280	2305640	but I do think I would never return to be with you,
2305640	2306800	my beloved brother.
2306800	2309840	He looks deeply into your eyes and puts out a hand
2309840	2313000	that he wants to interlock hands slowly.
2313080	2315800	Yeah, we do the thing where our fingers match up,
2315800	2316640	but then-
2316640	2320000	And then slide off to one side and then interlock.
2320000	2323520	I would miss you forever and never forgive myself.
2323520	2325360	I wouldn't forgive myself either.
2326400	2329160	Rosemary Lunge, the Planet Juggernaut, got sliced in half.
2329160	2330440	He jumped inside of her.
2330440	2332960	Keith Beans, one of them jumped down,
2332960	2335380	froze onto the bottom half, smashed that to bits.
2335380	2337220	Planet Juggernaut jumped to the side of that.
2337220	2338480	They're all diving all over the place.
2338480	2340960	Clark Bishop exploded the back of his head.
2340960	2344720	Oh my God, he just completely deheaded himself.
2344720	2348280	What do you think, Nick Nickles?
2348280	2349120	Deheaded.
2352640	2354960	There seems to be a lot going on in this combat,
2354960	2356860	but I can't help but think Clark Bishop
2356860	2359720	has been an absolute failure, both in the pit
2359720	2362240	and in this new hell we find ourselves in.
2362240	2365020	However, we do see another version
2365020	2366800	of seemingly this same man.
2366800	2370520	He's dressed in a weird 1970s version
2370520	2373400	of a contingent police officer uniform,
2373400	2375680	and this version of Clark Bishop,
2375680	2378520	oh, light came pouring out of his head
2378520	2381760	to save an older looking version of himself
2381760	2384480	from these large creatures,
2384480	2388240	oh, who seem to resemble our former employer,
2388240	2393120	who's now locked forever in some sort of weird icicle box
2393120	2395280	into a lava volcano.
2395280	2397680	Bobby Glass, they kind of look like him.
2397680	2398960	What do you think about that?
2398960	2402160	All I know is all these details are ruining my brain,
2402160	2406680	but I feel compelled to speak in a sports announcer voice.
2406680	2407760	Back to you.
2407760	2408600	Oh my God.
2413200	2415320	Jesus Christ, what the fuck is this shit?
2417200	2419160	Hey, do you guys want to play Delta Green?
2421280	2422120	No.
2428600	2429760	We could do this other thing though.
2429760	2432760	The other hand of the Gigantumbropithecus,
2432760	2436720	shadowy and dripping with ooze and pure darkness,
2436720	2441720	reaches up and additionally begins to waggle
2442880	2447880	its long phalanges into the murky water above you.
2449480	2452480	Two things happen in that moment.
2452480	2457480	One, the water begins to rise.
2457840	2462840	It is slowly lowering down toward you all.
2463080	2468080	And two, multiple unspeakable worm-like abominations
2468400	2473400	erupt out of the surface of this black, icorous ocean.
2474400	2477840	These things rise at least 10 feet out of the water,
2477840	2480960	down toward you, still far away this round,
2480960	2483440	but seemingly will be moving toward you
2483440	2487040	with each further round played in this combat.
2487040	2490680	They're tube-like, they're covered in squamous,
2490720	2493920	black, partially translucent membranes.
2493920	2495640	Their bodies are segmented,
2495640	2498520	toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins
2498520	2501280	can be seen through their thin looking exterior.
2501280	2504480	They have no identifiable eyes or nose
2504480	2507360	and their cavernous, circular mouths,
2507360	2509960	one sitting just inside the others,
2509960	2512400	are lined with hooked teeth.
2512400	2516800	They spit out saliva that's somehow darker than black
2516800	2521080	and from these maws, these sharp stylets protrude
2521080	2525640	like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.
2525640	2528120	Does Wheel of Forch John wing one
2528120	2529520	when he shoots into the air?
2531320	2532880	Roll.
2532880	2534040	Firearms.
2535800	2537040	70 on a 60.
2537040	2539440	The bullet hits one of these things
2539440	2543600	and it reacts not at all to the bullet fired
2543600	2546240	from this Wheel of Forch John.
2547800	2549360	John Wheel Pettymore.
2552840	2554680	Rosemary's turn.
2554680	2557360	Rosemary plugs one of her metal tendrils
2557360	2561840	into the ground next to her and then goes deeper
2561840	2565520	and then goes deeper and out in a circle
2565520	2569760	like a riplets from a drop of water into a puddle.
2569760	2573000	Those are called riplets because they're small.
2573000	2576080	These ripples are made of technicolor swirl
2576280	2581000	that begin to form around and you see a new portal
2581000	2586000	begin to form around one of these tentacles from Rosemary.
2587440	2589840	Keith, you are on the phone.
2591920	2595560	Hmm, this seems unnatural.
2595560	2598920	Maybe I should listen to it in a different type of way.
2599760	2604760	Yep, maybe with this passing unnatural role
2607760	2611120	I will finally understand something.
2614840	2619840	Hello, Keith Ashley Beans, what can we do for you?
2620120	2621560	That's a good question.
2621560	2623960	Hey Don, I got him on the phone.
2625120	2626760	Yeah, what can you do for me?
2627760	2629960	Anything you desire.
2629960	2632320	Hmm, can you get rid of that big thing out there?
2632320	2634360	We will send reinforcements.
2634360	2637880	Sweet, can you have him bring me a McFlurry too?
2637880	2640120	Oreo or M&M. Oreo please.
2642320	2643360	Don, you want anything?
2643360	2644200	I'm not in the room.
2644200	2646000	Get an Oreo and a M&M.
2646000	2649120	I couldn't tell because it's so dark in here.
2649120	2651720	Because it's so dark in here.
2651720	2654120	Hey Don, Don.
2655080	2657480	Well, how long until they get here?
2660360	2664120	I put the phone back on the thing.
2664120	2668280	I put the phone back on the phone and just lay there.
2670040	2671720	And by laying on the floor,
2671720	2675920	you've probably done just as much as anyone else has
2675920	2677280	for the combat hands.
2681640	2684000	You can't fail if you don't try.
2684960	2689960	Outside, the last remaining member of Myriad
2690760	2695760	is going to take on Clarkold once again in a struggle.
2695880	2698680	Please roll for Clarkold, Joe Terry.
2700520	2702960	He passed with a 38 on my end.
2702960	2704440	I rolled a 75.
2705440	2707560	I don't know what I'm rolling on though.
2707560	2709200	Oh, Clarkold has 80.
2709200	2710120	Nice.
2710120	2712880	So that's a big old success.
2712880	2714280	Big old success.
2714280	2717360	Literally this thing reaches out at Clarkold
2717360	2719440	and Clarkold looks at it
2719440	2724360	and its hand fucking shrivels back to its elbow.
2724360	2726800	Its forearm is completely missing
2726800	2730280	and its suit seemed to be tailored simultaneously
2730280	2731960	so you can see the effect.
2733520	2734760	Clark, your turn.
2734760	2736200	I'm gonna just use this turn
2736200	2738560	because it seems like Clarkold's got it handled
2738560	2740560	to yell out to the creature.
2740560	2742640	What do you want with us, him and me
2743640	2746080	and we, what do you want with me?
2746080	2748080	Hello, subject 1522518195518.
2752880	2757360	Warning, for your own safety, please stay here.
2757360	2760200	If you choose to disobey this order
2760200	2765120	and you return to plane 1620216,
2765120	2767520	you will be eliminated.
2767520	2770480	We need to stop that thing.
2770480	2772280	We're not your problem, that's your problem
2772800	2774920	and I'm pointing at the giant creature.
2774920	2777440	It makes this similar noise of just this like.
2777440	2778360	Ah, ah, ah.
2783200	2784600	Ah, ah, ah.
2784600	2787400	Yes, I now agree with you.
2787400	2788720	Oh, fuck yeah, dude.
2792000	2794000	I didn't know that was gonna work like that.
2796000	2798800	It turns and looks at this enormous,
2798840	2800440	gigantic morpithecus.
2800440	2802840	Its eyes get really big
2805240	2807880	and it looks down at its shriveled hand
2807880	2809800	and then looks down at its other hand
2809800	2810920	but it already took its turn.
2810920	2812600	So it's Don D. Pettymore.
2813800	2816160	I assume Don at this point is,
2816160	2819080	am I outside of the building observing what happened?
2819080	2823920	You are looking out on a field of gory glory.
2824280	2826280	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
2829280	2831280	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
2834280	2836080	Wait, do I see John?
2836080	2837240	Which John, man?
2837240	2838480	Yeah, you do.
2838480	2840720	John and original John body.
2840720	2842320	Do you see one of those?
2842320	2844800	It's not the same one you were talking to earlier.
2844800	2847080	That one's a shiny metal ball in the sky.
2847080	2851520	Yeah, now I'm like, John, John, John
2851520	2854440	and I'm like yelling at John and running towards him
2854440	2858560	because I'm curious if me calling the telephone
2858560	2860840	brought John back to help us
2860840	2862960	and I'm gonna run directly towards him.
2862960	2864480	I'm assuming he's decently far away.
2864480	2866560	I don't know if I have anything else to do, but.
2866560	2867680	Yeah, he's decently far away
2867680	2868840	and you have nothing else to do.
2868840	2871920	Let's go to Keith from the scrap pit.
2871920	2873360	He's not Jenny from the block.
2873360	2875680	He's Keith from the scrap pit and it's his turn.
2875680	2877520	Where have I landed?
2877520	2879760	Planet Juggernaut is right next to you.
2879800	2883040	Rosemary's top half with a tendril hanging out
2883040	2886000	and dug deep into the ground is ahead of you,
2886000	2887560	about 10 meters.
2887560	2890600	A portal is opening just to the left of her
2890600	2894000	and inside of her top half,
2894000	2898440	you see the writhing tentacles of the ball.
2898440	2902680	Over to your right, there's a massive liturgy worship
2902680	2904800	happening of the overseer.
2904800	2908200	Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.
2908200	2911600	Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.
2911600	2914960	Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.
2914960	2918640	Sha-ka-tee-fa-lee-ya, all for the overseer.
2918640	2920920	And Clark Bishop is in this group,
2920920	2923600	not chanting, but still dancing with them
2923600	2928600	while talking to this translucent gaunt figure
2929160	2930640	in a black suit.
2930640	2934400	Keith looks all around him at just the chaos.
2934880	2937840	He looks straight up and sees those worms.
2937840	2939280	Fuck those worms.
2939280	2941520	And he just jumps as high as he can,
2941520	2943960	trying to get sucked into the gravity
2943960	2946720	of the plane above him.
2946720	2949320	Oh shit, oh shit.
2949320	2951040	He's got those pneumatic legs.
2951040	2956040	Yeah, I mean, roll dexterity plus 40 for the legs.
2956200	2957480	Okay, that's a pass.
2957480	2959600	So I wanna jump as high as I can
2959600	2963960	and try to get sucked into the gravity of that plane
2964480	2968080	and once I feel the kind of shift,
2968080	2972720	I want to try to aim my body right into
2972720	2976040	one of the mouths of the worms
2976040	2978520	and just unload my freeze gun
2978520	2983520	as I slide into the open mouth of one of the worms.
2983640	2987400	Why, why, what?
2987400	2989440	I'm gonna freeze him from the inside out
2989440	2991000	and bust my way out of there.
2994960	2998200	Or get stuck in a frozen worm as it collapses to earth.
2999200	3000040	Either way.
3004560	3008200	Okay, roll firearms for the gun.
3008200	3010800	17, that's a pass.
3010800	3013360	The mouths inside of this,
3013360	3018360	you've got multiple round mouths of teeth spinning around.
3019320	3021240	It completely freezes up.
3021240	3022880	I mean, it's exactly as you said,
3022880	3025320	you go feet first down into this thing.
3028800	3033800	Elsa, Jonah heads directly into the enormous xenonematode.
3036840	3037680	Yee-haw.
3039680	3042240	Yee-haw indeed, Clark Bishop,
3042240	3044160	it would be one of your turns,
3044160	3047200	but okay, with this turn,
3047800	3052800	the legs that were up in the air fall down,
3056400	3058720	like on the other side, like forward,
3058720	3061520	and so his legs kind of go over where his head would be
3061520	3064560	and then land on the ground, boots first.
3065440	3067920	Planet Juggernaut, Europe.
3067920	3070240	Planet Juggernaut is eerily still,
3070240	3072480	and you hear worrying from inside of him.
3072480	3075720	Oh shit, oh shit.
3076680	3077960	The plan has begun.
3077960	3079200	Wheel of forts, Jon.
3079200	3081520	Jon wheel petty more.
3081520	3084760	Have we skipped first Jon?
3084760	3089000	Yes, sorry, we did.
3089000	3090200	First Jon is a ball.
3090200	3091440	Jon, you are a ball.
3091440	3095400	You are inside the top half of Rosemary's body.
3095400	3096240	What do you do?
3096240	3098680	Jon starts reaching his tendrils out
3098680	3102400	to the ball that's floating right above Rosemary's head,
3102400	3104920	and I wanna start to try to merge with it.
3104960	3105880	Roll a natural.
3108120	3110240	94, fail.
3112240	3114080	Pass, 68.
3115320	3118360	Like magnets, different poles.
3118360	3120880	You just bounce off this thing.
3120880	3125880	You can't enter even within the six inches nearest to it.
3126120	3130080	Something just like pulls you away, pulls you away.
3130080	3134000	Cool idea, very, very intrigued by that idea.
3134000	3135880	So Jon wheel petty more,
3135880	3140360	you see a long lost member of your family.
3140360	3145360	You haven't seen him in years, and he's running toward you.
3145480	3148760	Jon points his gun at Uncle Don and screams,
3148760	3150800	you stop right there, you son of a bitch.
3150800	3152240	Not one step further.
3152240	3154960	Don stops in his tracks, and he's like,
3154960	3157200	you're gonna talk to your uncle like that, boy?
3157200	3159280	What the fuck are you doing here, Uncle Don?
3159280	3161360	Why are you pointing a goddamn gun at me?
3161360	3162680	What is here?
3162680	3164400	Where the fuck are we?
3164400	3169400	Jon, I think that it's maybe too long of a story right now
3169880	3173280	for all of this, and he like,
3173280	3177120	what is the meme, gestures towards everything, like.
3177120	3180760	Jon looks over his shoulder and like looks at the nematodes,
3180760	3182760	the Xena nematodes falling from the sky,
3182760	3186040	and the giant kaijus.
3186040	3188200	He nods to Don and he says,
3188200	3190120	I reckon you might have a point,
3190120	3192160	and he lowers his pistol.
3192920	3195160	I think I brought you back here.
3195160	3198320	There is a phone, I threw it in a bag at one point,
3198320	3200880	and I thought it was supposed to help everything,
3200880	3203280	maybe it was gonna heal stuff, I don't know,
3203280	3207440	but I think you're here, maybe you can,
3207440	3210320	maybe you're what I asked for.
3210320	3214280	Maybe, I got brought here by a giant robot ball.
3214280	3216080	That seems a lot more helpful,
3216080	3217720	maybe that's what you asked for.
3217720	3220600	Maybe the phone works in mysterious ways.
3222320	3227320	The phone, is that like an old Hebrew name for the Lord?
3233000	3238000	It's a phone, it's a phone, like an old time telephone.
3239440	3240480	Uncle Don?
3240480	3241920	Yeah boy, what?
3241920	3243600	What do we do?
3243600	3246920	I'm not sure, I came here,
3246920	3250720	I was with you, but you were my brother,
3250720	3254160	but you said you was ball, but now you're you.
3254160	3256840	I don't know boy, I feel like I've lost my mind,
3256840	3261760	I don't know what's happening, what's real, and what's not,
3261760	3264920	but maybe you can help me, and I can,
3266400	3268600	he gets completely lost in a train of thought
3268600	3270200	that kind of goes nowhere.
3270200	3273320	When he says that you're ball,
3273320	3277000	this John has taken a moment to realize where he is
3277000	3279720	and what's going on, and he sees the other balls,
3279720	3281880	he sees Planet Juggernaut,
3281880	3284360	some tendrils start poking out of his back,
3284360	3288000	and one of them pats Uncle Don on the shoulder reassuringly.
3295880	3297560	He freezes up at first.
3297560	3299000	Yes, the metal is quite cool.
3302360	3305640	Damn, were you always ball?
3305640	3308640	Yes, I am a John of fortune.
3309720	3311240	Pfft.
3339720	3344720	What kind of world are you livin' in?
3348400	3353400	What kind of world are you livin' in?
3370400	3375400	What kind of world are you livin' in?
3378680	3383680	What kind of world are you livin' in?
