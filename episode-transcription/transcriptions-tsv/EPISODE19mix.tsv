0	4520	Hello my cast and crew and adoring audience.
4520	9720	It's your theater director that brings that sweet sweet nectar, Wolf the dog.
9720	17540	And you know I'm blocking all the scenes here in contention from 694.2 PTBP like I always
17540	19120	do my babies.
19120	24080	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener who tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter.
24080	28320	And your buddy Wolf appreciates that so fucking much y'all.
28320	29320	He writes.
29320	30920	Hello Mr. Wolf.
30920	37680	My name is Eidos Fillmore and I'm a proud but concerned resident of 45 years here in
37680	38680	contention.
38680	43640	First, I don't actually understand the program that follows your fine program.
43640	45520	I have no idea.
45520	49520	What I do have an idea about are all the pets going missing lately.
49520	53640	Hell, the families on my block are missing the dogs and the cats.
53640	58680	But who's the only citizen who also happens to serve on the city council to have a deputy
58680	61880	come out and personally assist her and her stupid dog?
61880	63840	Sir, you're a deputy.
63840	65720	Don't you have better things to be doing?
65720	70420	And then this fella Deputy Vigna coming home like some goddamn prodigal son.
70420	73960	Except he ain't no prodigal and we all wish he would have stayed gone.
73960	79880	I heard he almost laid hands on Leo Piston the day before he mysteriously goes missing.
79880	80880	Hmm.
81120	83240	Sorry for the long note, Wolf.
83240	84240	Signed, Eidos.
84240	86120	Damn, Eidos.
86120	88240	You bring up some solid complaints.
88240	91480	Maybe we should do something about these stupid coppers.
91480	96320	From what I can tell, the hip new spot for all the cool cats in contention is in the
96320	98680	creeks and ponds, my babies.
98680	103280	For all you cool cats listening, you too can submit a message to be read by your old pal
103280	109880	Wolf by tagging app pretending pod on social media or writing a five star review, screenshotting
109880	113800	it and sending it to pretendingpod at gmail dot com.
113800	117200	But either way, isn't it about time you left us a review?
117200	120120	You know what makes Wolf the dog feel so good.
120120	126080	I want to bathe in your five stars, my babies, help your little wolfy boy get all squeaky
126080	127080	clean.
127080	130920	However, now it's time to dig up some dirt.
130920	132380	It's the news.
132380	136080	The officers were last seen causing a fatal car crash.
136080	141640	A minivan was run off the road by Officer Betty Moore, a former teen sprint car racer
141640	147720	who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.
147720	150320	The minivan flipped and caught fire.
150320	153480	Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage.
153480	156640	The boy is at the clinic in critical condition.
156640	162880	The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and the other passenger who were both trapped
162880	164440	in the vehicle.
164440	170240	The vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose and the memories of a particularly
170240	172920	traumatic childhood Christmas y'all.
172920	179400	Speaking of Christmas, I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need.
179400	184200	I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree.
184200	192080	I just want five star reviews, take just a second on iTunes, make my wish come true y'all.
192080	197480	All I want for Christmas is kudzoo with no backbone.
213160	214680	Who did the scoop?
214680	217720	I have a hypothetical situation for you guys.
217720	225480	If you had the opportunity to have this magical ability, which is anytime you were done with
225480	230160	a piece of clothing that you were wearing, you could drop it on the floor and it would
230160	237840	immediately be pressed and laundered and back in your chest of drawers or your closet like
237840	242840	immediately or wherever you needed your clothes to be at that moment.
242840	246840	But in order to get this ability, you have to fuck a corpse.
246960	248560	Yeah, for sure. Two birds.
248560	249560	For how long?
249560	250560	Okay, good question.
250560	251560	To completion?
251560	254560	No, you have to fuck a corpse for five minutes.
254560	255560	Until it comes.
256560	258560	You have to make a corpse come, okay.
258560	261560	How fresh or old is the corpse?
261560	265560	The corpse is roughly your age.
265560	269560	When's the last time it was alive?
269560	270560	Right, yeah.
270560	272560	Oh, that's what you meant by fresh.
272560	274560	Still warm?
274560	275560	Uh, no.
276280	278280	Like days, weeks?
278280	280280	Like six hours.
280280	282280	Oh, yeah, for sure.
282280	285280	Wait, why does that matter? What if it was a day old?
285280	287280	Still, but if it was like six weeks.
287280	288280	Right.
288280	289280	It'd be harder to do.
289280	290280	Or three years.
290280	291280	Yeah.
291280	292280	Right, okay, well that would be much harder.
292280	293280	It'd be just like bones.
293280	294280	I don't know.
294280	295280	Rubbing your bones.
295280	296280	I would fuck a six hour corpse.
296280	300280	So he was baiting us into blackmail is what that was.
300280	303280	I have this recorded for posterity.
303280	305280	He just has dirt on his mouth.
306000	310000	Is the question, I'm doing someone's laundry until they die and then I get to fuck them?
310000	314000	Then yeah.
314000	320000	I think a more interesting consequence is that your clothes would be perfectly folded,
320000	326000	pressed, put away, but a random person in the world's like comparable outfit just bursts
326000	327000	into flames.
327000	328000	Like, is gone.
328000	329000	Then double, yeah.
329000	331000	Yeah, I would do that.
331000	334000	It's like the opposite of Tom's.
334000	335000	Yeah.
335720	337720	Like actually every time you do it, a pair of Toms.
337720	338720	Disappears.
338720	339720	Disappears.
339720	345120	Okay, so John, you are holding this wet black cat and you have just called it Doug and told
345120	346480	it you would help him.
346480	350120	I think you mean I'm holding a man.
350120	351120	I'm holding Doug.
351120	352760	I didn't just call this cat Doug.
352760	353760	This is basic.
353760	370640	You're talking to my old man.
370640	372640	Radio?
372640	374640	The radio turned you into this cat?
374640	376880	Hey, I don't like, you guys see this, right?
376880	379260	This cat is definitely, I'm talking to this cat.
379260	380260	Is your name Doug?
380260	383140	Yeah, that's a yes.
383520	384520	Is your name Clark?
384520	385520	Meow, meow.
385520	386520	Okay, good.
386520	387520	We've got the twos and the twos.
387520	388520	No.
388520	389520	One is yes.
389520	390520	Is two no?
390520	391520	Meow.
391520	392520	Is one yes?
392520	393520	Meow.
393520	394520	Is two yes?
394520	395520	Meow.
395520	396520	Meow.
396520	399700	This is a smart cat because it's Doug.
399700	400700	I have a quick question.
400700	403060	Am I still at a negative 20 right now?
403060	404060	Meow.
404060	406500	Doug, do you know how this happened to you?
406500	407500	Meow.
407500	408700	So you could turn, you could fix it?
408700	410180	We could help you fix it.
410180	411180	You know how to fix it?
411180	412180	Meow.
412220	413220	Was that?
413220	416420	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
416420	422000	As you guys are talking to this cat, a crowd of people show up.
422000	423000	They're standing around.
423000	426740	A lot of them begin booing at you.
426740	430340	Many of them have their phones up and are taking videos.
430340	435860	And a young girl walks up to go ahead and roll luck against each other and see who rolls
435860	438380	the lowest or goes over the most.
438380	443820	Uh, I'd go pretty far over, 87 on a 55.
443820	446860	I'm really far under, I've got a 12 on a 75.
446860	449820	I got 69 on a 65.
449820	450820	Hell yeah.
450820	457340	A little girl walks up to John Lee Pettymore and she spits at you and a voice yells out
457340	464260	from the crowd, yeah girl, fuck the police, uh, hey guys, uh, I think we better get out
464260	465260	of here.
465260	467740	And Drew jumps into the back of Officer Vigno's cruiser.
467780	471540	Alright, come on, Doug, it's not safe for cop or beast.
471540	472860	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
472860	474660	I also get into my cruiser.
474660	476860	Yeah, our cruisers are gone, right?
476860	478940	So I get into Vigno's cruiser with Doug.
478940	480220	I get in also.
480220	485100	Okay, I take off, I put my lights on and honk and...
485100	487620	What do you guys think that angry mob was about?
487620	490100	Is it that we let that lady and those kids die?
490100	491460	We saved one of the kids.
491460	492460	Meow?
492460	494500	Not let, it just happened near us.
494500	495980	Don't worry, Doug.
496700	497700	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
497700	498700	Nothing's gonna happen to you.
498700	499700	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
499700	504020	Well, that girl better be happy she did that to you, because if it was me, there'd be one
504020	505020	more dead kid.
505020	510300	Doug, you're gonna have to excuse Officer Vigno, he has a bizarre sense of humor.
510300	513020	I just, I saw a lot of weird shit today, I'm just trying to make up.
513020	514020	That's true, we all have.
514020	515180	We're talking to a cat right now.
515180	522820	This cat looks up at you and its eyes switch over from slits to full blown, like, black
522820	531180	pupils and it jumps out of your hands, John, and it jumps into Clark's lap and looks back
531180	534780	at you fearfully before its eyes move back into slits.
534780	535780	I'd stroke him gently.
535780	536780	It's okay, Doug.
536780	540100	Vigno's the one saying scary shit, cat.
540100	541780	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
541780	543500	This guy loves communism.
543500	549140	You fellas think we should go back to the station and see if we can do some body switching?
549140	550140	Yeah.
550140	551140	Would you like us to switch your body?
551140	552140	I think we have the technology.
552460	553460	That's it.
553460	557380	Let's go back to the station and we'll think about the angry mob later.
557380	558380	Meow.
558380	562620	You guys roll up to the station and outside of the police station there is a group of
562620	564940	people holding up signs.
564940	569140	They're walking around in a big circle and they seem to be chanting something along the
569140	577020	lines of, our cops are crooks, our pigs are pricks, if we could choose they'd lose their
577020	578020	dicks.
578020	579300	Oh well shit, yikes.
579300	582100	If only they knew that had actually happened to one of us earlier.
582100	584340	Hey, that's not funny.
584340	589740	There's a sign that says, justice for Tilde B in all caps.
589740	592820	Another says, where is Leo Piston?
592820	598300	One of the protesters is just holding up a tablet with a video of Officer Pettymore firing
598300	601280	into the air and yelling at civilians.
601280	603940	More signs say, that's completely taken out of context.
603940	610740	30 people went missing in one week and they blew up Chief Cook, I say we cook up the blue.
610740	611740	Wow.
612380	614380	Are you proud of yourself for that one, Zach?
614380	620340	I am so proud of myself for that.
620340	621340	Who was Tilde B?
621340	622900	Well, that was the girl, right?
622900	625040	The one that shot the gun and disappeared.
625040	626040	That is correct.
626040	627040	Okay.
627040	628040	Oh shit.
628040	629540	The woman across the street from John Peters house's daughter.
629540	630540	Milgram Mitchell.
630540	631540	Milgram Mitchell.
631540	632540	Oh it was Milgram Mitchell.
632540	637420	If Maggie had been here, she would have been having press conferences and I guess assuring
637420	639220	people that we had it under control.
639220	642420	I guess we forgot the public relations part of our job.
642420	645180	Whoever has the highest humant, who is that?
645180	646180	Me.
646180	648520	Can you go ahead and roll humant for me?
648520	650380	That's a crit success.
650380	653420	Drew is so nervous right now.
653420	655660	He is fiddling with his thumbs.
655660	658100	He's not holding eye contact with anyone.
658100	662420	He's trying to avoid any conversation.
662420	665860	Hey Drew, what's the matter?
665860	671180	Well, just, you know, nervous we got this cat in here that's I guess supposed to be
671180	675160	the cat of another cat and there's the people inside a cat and there's cats inside people
675160	681980	and there was a body from old and a body from new and there's just a lot of stuff going
681980	686480	on right now and I'm freaking out man.
686480	687480	This is crazy.
687480	692100	Drew, I think maybe you should go try to calm this crowd down out there.
692100	693100	Yeah?
693100	695400	Yeah, you're a good public speaker.
695400	698760	Go ahead and roll persuade.
698760	702040	That's another crit success.
702040	704320	Do you think that'll help?
704320	710240	Oh, that can't hurt.
710240	714840	So you pull up into the parking lot and Drew hops out.
714840	716960	You guys can hear him.
716960	726080	Hello everyone, members of the, the established population of contention.
726080	731400	I am here to tell you that nothing is wrong.
731400	739480	Everything is fine and you're all overreacting to the truths of the universe that are real.
739480	743760	Drew, Drew, Drew, Drew dial it back buddy, I go and grab it.
743760	745600	What is actually happening?
745600	754040	I fire my gun in the air a few times to distract people from...
754040	759480	There are people just like taking videos with their cameras of all of this happening.
759480	762320	I'm assuming you guys dip into the police station.
762320	763320	Immediately.
763320	765160	Okay, so you all run in there.
765160	767280	Uh, Drew, that, that didn't go so well.
767280	769320	Drew, was there a mob here when you left?
769320	772240	No, I didn't, I didn't see one.
772240	777240	Guys, I've been kind of overwhelmed recently and I mean, Florence hasn't checked in today
777240	783040	at all and you know, I'd figured she'd be helping out with, I don't know, here.
783040	787120	I grab Drew by the shoulders and I look him deep in the eye and I'm like, Drew, buddy,
787120	790480	I need you to keep it together today.
790480	794480	You understand?
794480	795600	Roll human.
795600	797240	Who's Florence?
797240	798800	15.
798800	803440	Florence is the police officer that works alongside you guys in contention.
803440	809000	They typically take care of most things that are happening around the town.
809000	810200	You rolled a 15?
810200	812280	On a 40 or 50.
812280	822920	Okay, so he calms down and he's like, okay, well this is, this is hard and I wanted to,
822920	828720	you know, tell you guys over time, you know, maybe this would all kind of fade away, but
828720	833440	and he reaches over his desk and he grabs this sheet of paper.
833440	840480	He hands it to you guys and it says, remember to tell the guys at the top and then it lists
840480	848360	off like 20 names as missing persons and roughly 100 phone calls about the animals in the water.
848360	853720	There's also just a section heading called complaints and it has more tallies than you
853720	856120	could possibly care to count.
856120	861160	The last thing on the list just says feds left a message.
861160	862160	Who left a message?
862160	863160	What did the feds say?
863160	864160	Drew?
864160	865160	Let me find it.
865160	869880	And he messes with the phone and you hear the voicemail come over and it's like, no
869880	874480	new messages, all messages have been deleted.
874480	880320	And he's like, oh shit, um, I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was.
880320	886720	I think the general gist was like, Hey, what the fuck is going on?
886720	889440	The news media, I don't know something.
889440	893560	People are, guys, people are really upset.
893560	894640	That much is apparent.
894640	897200	How did you get so bad at your job so quickly, Drew?
897200	905120	I've always been pretty bad at my job, but chief, don't laugh at me.
905120	908200	Chief cookie has typically kept everything together.
908200	909400	She keeps me on time.
909400	911640	She keeps me keeping up with everything.
911640	913680	She would never let it get out of hand like this.
913680	918440	Drew, if chief were here, how do you think she would go about assuaging the fears of
918440	919440	the public?
919440	920440	Yeah, buddy.
920440	921440	What would chief do?
921440	922440	What would chief do?
922440	923440	What would chief do?
923440	925640	I don't know.
925640	928200	We've never dealt with anything like this before.
928200	934280	I think the first thing chief would tell you to do is to make yourself and us and Dr. Jacobs
934280	936840	and that cat man, a nice hot cup of coffee.
937560	941240	We're just going to take a step back and deal with this one thing at a time.
941240	946040	Drew, if Florence wasn't so hilariously inept at his job, he would have kept you on that
946040	947040	list.
947040	948040	I know he would.
948040	949040	You would have been on the ball.
949040	950040	This isn't your fault.
950040	951040	This is Florence's fault.
951040	952040	Where is he?
952040	953040	Are you okay, John?
953040	956200	Yeah, I mean, because I'm being nice to you?
956200	958320	No, it's just that Florence is a woman.
958320	959320	He knows that.
959320	962680	Yeah, it's just a joke between me and Florence.
962680	964680	Oh, does she think it's funny?
964680	965680	You know what?
965720	967120	I'll never stop to consider that.
967120	970960	All right, well, maybe we'll ask her.
970960	971960	You're right.
971960	972960	I'll just go make some coffee.
972960	977000	And he runs into the back room and gets a pot going.
977000	978000	I'm holding Doug.
978000	981880	I say, Doug, we've got the radio.
981880	984160	Is that part of the process of getting you switched?
984160	985160	Meow.
985160	986160	Okay.
986160	987160	Is it safe for me to touch it?
987160	988160	Meow.
988160	989160	Okay.
989160	992640	I'm going to set Doug down and go back to the lockers and get the radio out.
992640	993640	He follows you.
993640	994640	Okay.
994640	995640	The cat follows you.
995640	996880	I want to take the radio.
996880	999920	The radio has a red light showing on it.
999920	1005080	I want to take the radio, go back to the cells, and set it on the outside of the cells.
1005080	1006080	Okay.
1006080	1007520	Mildred assuming is there.
1007520	1008520	Dr. Marie Jacobs.
1008520	1009520	Oh, fuck yeah.
1009520	1011040	Dr. Marie Jacobs.
1011040	1015320	Doc, somebody here you may or may not be happy to see.
1015320	1017120	She's asleep and she kind of wakes up.
1017120	1020600	I kind of gesture toward the kitten.
1020600	1021600	Ah!
1021600	1022600	Oh.
1022600	1024720	So he made it alive, did he?
1024720	1027920	I just assumed the tar would have gotten him by now.
1027920	1028920	The tar?
1028920	1029920	Whatever.
1029920	1030920	Is that what you call the goo?
1030920	1031920	We've been calling it goo.
1031920	1032920	Have we?
1032920	1033920	We call it goo, right?
1033920	1034920	I think we call it goo.
1034920	1036960	I just had never heard anybody refer to it other than us.
1036960	1037960	Yeah.
1037960	1038960	How do you know about the goo?
1038960	1041560	I fear I've spoken out of turn.
1041560	1042560	What are you doing?
1042560	1045000	Well, we're going to put your husband back in his body.
1045000	1046000	No.
1046000	1047000	Yeah.
1047000	1048000	No.
1048000	1049000	Ma'am, I know.
1049000	1050000	Why don't you want that to happen?
1050000	1051000	I want to go home.
1051000	1053680	You should just let me go home with the man that I have now.
1053680	1057080	We've kind of got to let your husband go home from this cat's body.
1057080	1059360	You are talking like a...
1059360	1061560	We'll get him switched and you can go home.
1061560	1062560	Done.
1062560	1063560	You don't have to let him come with you.
1063560	1067620	It seems like this body switch has exposed some serious problems in your relationship
1067620	1069720	and maybe you two have a lot to work out, you know?
1069720	1072980	He can get a hotel, but he does need his body back, doctor.
1072980	1073980	Can I have the radio?
1073980	1074980	No.
1074980	1075980	No.
1075980	1077400	Why would you even think that was a possibility?
1077400	1078400	Why?
1078400	1079400	I bought the radio.
1079400	1080400	Did you want to do that to another man and cat?
1080400	1081400	No.
1081400	1082400	I wanted to do it to the same ones.
1082400	1086600	Ma'am, we can't let you...
1086600	1090540	I don't think there's a law on the books, but I know you can't radio your husband into
1090540	1093440	a cat and keep him trapped there for the rest of his life.
1093440	1095560	Like you just said, there's nothing on the books.
1095560	1097520	Also, how's it going to work?
1097520	1100200	Cats die within 15 years, 20 years.
1100200	1101200	I haven't thought about it that much.
1101200	1102200	How old's your cat?
1102200	1103200	You know?
1103200	1107760	And then, will the cat's brain die in your husband's body as he just gets older?
1107760	1108960	You haven't thought about this at all, man.
1108960	1110880	I certainly don't know the rules.
1110880	1112560	The rules are that you can't do this.
1112560	1117520	Well, I meant the rules of how long things would take to die within other bodies and
1117520	1118520	what have you.
1118520	1122920	I get the keys and open up the cell, get the husband out, and keep her in there and lock
1122920	1123920	it back.
1123920	1124920	Yeah.
1124920	1125920	That can go off without much of a head show.
1125920	1126920	What's he wearing?
1126920	1127920	He's wearing like...
1127920	1130560	He was in his underwear, and they were like SpongeBob underwear or something like that?
1130560	1132160	Or maybe a cartoon cat?
1132160	1133480	I hope it was a cartoon cat.
1133480	1134760	I can't remember now.
1134760	1135760	Underwear foreshadowing.
1135760	1136760	Pepe Le Pew.
1136760	1137760	Pepe Le Pew.
1138680	1143580	He also has a black collar around his neck, and he's got dried blood kind of still around
1143580	1146280	his mouth, but he's licked everything else clean.
1146280	1155580	I look at Doug, and I say, Doug, if he turns on the radio, will that do it?
1155580	1158200	The cat thinks for a second before saying, meow.
1158200	1161620	Will that have unintended consequences, perhaps?
1161620	1163280	There's only one way to find out.
1163280	1165080	I don't trust this cat.
1165080	1166080	Roll cat intelligence.
1166080	1167840	I don't want to turn into a cat standing here.
1167840	1168840	I don't either.
1168840	1173960	I think, okay, I think we need to approach Dr. Jacobs with some kind of deal.
1173960	1177160	We're going to have to try to persuade her to tell us how this happened and how this
1177160	1178160	worked.
1178160	1180240	Or we'll keep her locked here forever.
1180240	1181240	That's pretty good.
1181240	1183280	Yeah, hey, 30 people are missing in contention.
1183280	1185760	Nobody's going to miss one more.
1185760	1186840	We can go that route with it.
1186840	1189000	We can go pretty dark, or we can...
1189000	1190620	I wouldn't go that route.
1190620	1192120	You're not...
1192120	1193720	Shut up, Dr. Jacobs.
1193720	1196040	30 people disappeared in contention.
1196040	1197840	It would be easy for one more to go missing.
1197840	1199720	Now we're trying to think of how we're going to convince you.
1199720	1200720	I wouldn't.
1200720	1201720	I wouldn't convince me like that.
1201720	1202720	Shut up.
1202720	1204320	30 people have gone missing in contention.
1204320	1207320	Hey, Doc, how did this happen the first time?
1207320	1208320	It just happened.
1208320	1209320	I don't know.
1209320	1210320	Doc, how'd it happen?
1210320	1211320	What did the goo do?
1211320	1213120	The goo just ran out.
1213120	1214840	Followed the cat.
1214840	1215840	Your husband or...
1215840	1217920	Well, yeah, I guess he was a cat then.
1217920	1220440	Ma'am, we will let you free right now.
1220440	1221440	Okay.
1221440	1223040	With your cat body, husband.
1223280	1225160	Or with your man body cat.
1225160	1226160	Okay.
1226160	1227160	If you tell us how it happened.
1227160	1228160	Wait, no, that...
1228160	1230640	No, because if I tell you how it happened, you're just going to use it.
1230640	1231640	I promise I won't do that.
1231640	1233120	No, we're really scared to use it.
1233120	1235040	We don't want to be a cat, so just tell us.
1235040	1236680	That way we know to not use it.
1236680	1239080	Yeah, that way we know how to not do that.
1239080	1241200	Okay, which one of you has a better persuade?
1241200	1242200	I have a 70.
1242200	1243200	I have a 60.
1243200	1245440	All right, roll it up, Keith.
1245440	1246760	A 70 on a 70.
1246760	1248200	Oh, that's a success.
1248200	1249200	Yes.
1249200	1250200	Okay.
1250200	1251200	All right, tell us how it happened.
1251200	1254680	If you promise that I get to leave with Salem.
1254680	1255680	Of course, we promise.
1255680	1256680	In this...
1256680	1258680	Yeah, yeah, we promise.
1258680	1259680	Okay.
1259680	1262720	I turned it on and left the room.
1262720	1264480	With the cat and the man in there?
1264480	1265480	Yeah.
1265480	1266480	What station?
1266480	1267480	NPR.
1267480	1268480	Okay.
1268480	1270120	Uh, gross, first of all.
1270120	1272520	I didn't know they let you listen to that in contingent.
1272520	1273520	It's national.
1273520	1275520	Well, they got some good stories on there, Jon.
1275520	1276520	I mean...
1276520	1277520	Clark.
1277520	1278520	Okay, so...
1278520	1286600	Let's put him and the cat in a room together and turn that radio on and leave.
1286600	1288080	Do you believe her?
1288080	1290080	I do.
1290080	1291600	I think it's hilarious she believed us.
1291600	1295920	Clark, I rolled a 70 on my persuade.
1295920	1297920	Sometimes you just speak in mysteries, Keith.
1297920	1300080	I mean, what can it hurt?
1300080	1301320	Turn into a cat.
1301320	1302320	I'll do it.
1302320	1303320	Okay.
1303320	1304320	All right.
1304320	1305320	Okay.
1305320	1306320	I pat him on the back.
1306320	1307320	Thanks for taking this one, man.
1307320	1313440	I go into the solitary confinement cell that we have, right?
1313440	1314440	Probably not.
1314440	1315440	Oh, you can do the interrogation room?
1315440	1316680	Yeah, the interrogation room.
1316680	1317680	Perfect.
1317680	1321200	I bring the cat and Doug's body into the interrogation room.
1321200	1323560	Me and you are on the other side of the two-way mirror.
1323560	1324560	Yep.
1324560	1328680	Clark, Clark, either way, this could go real good for us.
1328680	1334920	So I'm gonna put Doug's human body in handcuffs, just, you know.
1334920	1335920	Sure.
1335920	1336920	Oh, wait, fuck.
1336920	1337920	Oh, sorry.
1337920	1340760	We can also check with the cat if that what she just told us is how it happened.
1340760	1341760	Oh, shit.
1341760	1342760	Yeah.
1342760	1344440	I've beeped in through the intercom on the two-way mirror.
1344440	1345440	Hey, cat.
1345440	1346760	Is what she said earlier what happened?
1346760	1347760	Meow.
1347760	1348760	Cool.
1348760	1349760	Cool.
1349760	1350760	Okay.
1350760	1353560	So Doug, I need you to sit on the table and then I'm gonna have your body sit right here.
1353560	1356160	Do we have any cat treats we can distract the body with?
1356160	1357560	I had a toy at one point.
1357560	1361360	I run out to my desk real quick, grab it out of the drawer.
1361360	1364800	I come into the interrogation room and I just kind of crack the door open and toss it in
1364800	1365800	and close it real quick.
1365880	1367680	Then I get back behind the two-way mirror.
1367680	1373520	I grab the cat toy and dangle it in front of Doug's face, Doug, the human body face.
1373520	1374520	Salem.
1374520	1375520	Salem's face.
1375520	1379360	And then I put it on the table in front of him and then I've got the radio.
1379360	1380360	It's a big radio.
1380360	1381360	Like...
1381360	1383360	He's dragged it into the corner.
1383360	1384360	How, like...
1384360	1385360	You can...
1385360	1386360	Like one of those big old, like...
1386360	1387360	Yeah, it's big.
1387360	1390200	Like you would be able to carry it, but it would, it would be a lug.
1390200	1391200	Yeah, it's awkward.
1391200	1392200	Okay.
1392200	1393200	I do that.
1393200	1394200	Put it in the room.
1394200	1395200	What light is on?
1395200	1396200	Red.
1396200	1398840	If I press buttons on it, does anything change?
1398840	1399840	Or turn it into not dials?
1399840	1400840	I peep the intercom.
1400840	1403840	Uh, Keith, do you plug it in?
1403840	1404840	I plug it in.
1404840	1405840	Red.
1405840	1406840	Turn it to NPR.
1406840	1408840	I turn it to NPR.
1408840	1410840	91.1.
1410840	1411840	Red.
1411840	1414840	I turn it to literally every station.
1414840	1415840	Red.
1415840	1416840	Put the cat on there.
1416840	1420840	I'm gonna just leave both these guys in the room for a second and leave.
1420840	1421840	What do you think, Keith?
1421840	1422840	I don't know what to do.
1422840	1424760	Do you guys have any thoughts?
1424760	1425760	The light's just red.
1425760	1427160	The radio's on, though, right?
1427160	1428160	Just left it on?
1428160	1429160	It's on, yeah.
1429160	1431680	I turned it on and pressed all the buttons, so.
1431680	1432680	We got shit to do.
1432680	1435520	Let's leave them in here if we fire our eyes and see if we come back with them switched.
1435520	1436680	Could work.
1436680	1440160	What if they switch and re-switch several times, though, and they're trapped in there?
1440160	1442160	We could just ask Doug and see if it happened.
1442160	1443160	Some kind of hell.
1443160	1445800	You know, once we get back, we can say, hey, did you switch and switch back?
1445800	1447200	Like some kind of hell.
1447200	1451480	Yeah, you know, this is one of the least of my concerns at this point right now, honestly.
1451480	1452480	We found Doug.
1452480	1455880	Yeah, there were a lot of protesters outside, and they got angry with a bunch of hornets
1455880	1457320	when I shot those bullets off, so.
1457320	1458320	Should we shoot at them?
1458320	1459320	No.
1459320	1460560	No, I think that would only exacerbate things.
1460560	1461880	Okay, how do we deal with this, then?
1461880	1464520	God, if only Maggie was here.
1464520	1465520	With the camera.
1465520	1468120	Can you remember anything we did that made those lights turn on?
1468120	1473560	The best of my recollection, every time something really fucking scary was about to happen,
1473560	1474560	they turned on.
1474560	1475920	Tell me a scary story.
1475920	1480560	Maybe we lock them up in a cruiser, take them with us, and any time we, you know, feel the
1480560	1483360	hair tingle stand up on the back of our necks, we can.
1483360	1485080	What if Doug's body runs away, though?
1485080	1486440	Oh, we got that toy.
1486440	1487440	Oh, what if we-
1487440	1488440	No, I don't.
1488440	1489440	That's not letting it work.
1489440	1490440	What if we try to get the doctor to do it?
1490440	1491440	She probably won't do it, though.
1491440	1492440	She won't do it.
1492440	1494160	What if we tell her we're gonna, I don't know, threaten her to-
1494160	1498440	Oh, hey, let's go ask her how, what color the light was and how, what the circumstances
1498440	1499440	were that it turned on.
1499440	1500440	There we go.
1500440	1501440	I go back to the doctor.
1501440	1505280	So tell me more about the night this happened.
1505280	1506920	Didn't work, did it?
1506920	1509160	I saw you bring that radio out here.
1509160	1510920	I saw the light was red.
1510920	1512680	Was the light not red when, uh-
1512680	1518640	The light was green when I used it, and I would imagine that it won't work again until
1518640	1521120	the light is green once again.
1521120	1523680	Do you know how to get the light to turn green?
1523680	1524680	No.
1524680	1528440	You said something that stuck in my craw, and I can't remember what it was, but it was
1528440	1529640	about the tar.
1529640	1531480	Joe, what's in your craw, Joe?
1531480	1532480	Spit it out.
1532480	1535480	In real life, I swear there was something about the ooze being near the radio.
1535480	1537120	Well, cause no ooze radio.
1537120	1538120	There was ooze coming out of the camera.
1538160	1539520	Remember the last time we took a picture?
1539520	1540520	It came out of the picture.
1540520	1542400	It came out of the picture?
1542400	1546000	Yeah, as I was holding it, it came out of the picture onto my hands.
1546000	1548000	Or I was holding it from the camera.
1548000	1549000	So-
1549000	1550000	It was dripping from both.
1550000	1551000	Yeah.
1551000	1552640	I don't know what to do.
1552640	1553640	Yeah, I think you're right.
1553640	1558000	Maybe just leave it on and see what happens when we get back some time later.
1558000	1559000	I don't know.
1559000	1560000	I don't know if we should leave it on.
1560000	1564720	Maybe we should, cause what, I mean, actually the potential consequences of that are-
1564720	1568040	Yeah, but I mean, they're kind of just on all the time though, right?
1568960	1569960	Radios?
1569960	1572760	I mean, this isn't just a radio though.
1572760	1576840	Right, but it seems like these devices have to be activated once the green light is on.
1576840	1578600	So we should turn the radio off.
1578600	1580280	We have to take the picture to get it to go.
1580280	1581280	Yeah, that's true.
1581280	1584080	I think we lock them all up in that cell.
1584080	1585080	I'm sorry.
1585080	1586080	This is Thomas speaking.
1586080	1587120	This is John speaking.
1587120	1591040	I think we should all lock them up in that cell and let them spend some quality time
1591040	1592040	with each other.
1592040	1597080	And Dr. Jakes seems to fucking hate that guy and I'm not a big fan of hers right now cause
1597120	1598600	she's not a whole lot of help.
1598600	1602360	Maybe we'll come back and they're like screaming and she's like, meow, meow.
1602360	1606040	We should probably keep them in the interrogation room because the cat could probably get out
1606040	1607040	of it.
1607040	1608320	No, I think the cat can just have free.
1608320	1609320	I like that cat.
1609320	1610320	That's true.
1610320	1611320	I want the cat.
1611320	1612320	I want Doug.
1612320	1613320	Doug.
1613320	1614320	His name is Doug.
1614320	1615320	His name is Doug.
1615320	1616320	I want Doug to not be stuck with her.
1616320	1617760	I think she might kill him.
1617760	1618760	I think you're right.
1618760	1619760	That's true.
1619760	1620760	I think we should, yeah.
1620760	1625240	Okay, so let's lock the cat man back up and then put the radio back in the-
1625400	1627880	Let's put the cat man in a different cell so she can't be by it.
1627880	1630040	Give him a little time apart to think about things.
1630040	1631040	I like that.
1631040	1635160	You can't, you can't fuck your cat man while we're gone, Dr. Jacobs.
1635160	1636160	Yeah.
1636160	1638440	Okay, so where is everything?
1638440	1640520	You're letting Doug come with you guys.
1640520	1643440	I think Doug was just going to have free rein at the station, right?
1643440	1644440	Yeah.
1644440	1645440	Gotcha.
1645440	1646440	Doug can have free rein at the station.
1646440	1647440	He could be our sidekick.
1647440	1648920	Doug, do you want to be our sidekick?
1648920	1649920	Meow, meow.
1649920	1650920	Yeah.
1650920	1654000	So Doug, you can run around the station until we get back.
1654000	1656960	Oh, hey Doug, do you know anything about what's going on at the mill?
1656960	1658240	Anything about the ooze?
1658240	1659440	What happened to the chief?
1659440	1662640	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
1662640	1663760	What's going on with the ooze?
1663760	1664760	Meow.
1664760	1665760	Oh yeah.
1665760	1672080	And then the cat jumps up on the table, it like bows a little bit and then it moves its
1672080	1678480	head up and then it falls on its back and it like widens its eyes really big and starts
1678480	1683420	moving its paws around and then it flips back over on top of itself and then it looks right
1683420	1688380	behind it and it like freaks out and jumps up in the air and then it starts running,
1688380	1689380	right?
1689380	1695340	And then it runs over to the sink in the kitchen that you guys have in the station and it like
1695340	1696800	paws at the water.
1696800	1698380	The ooze is afraid of water?
1698380	1699380	Meow.
1699380	1700380	Boom.
1700380	1701380	That's why the animals are in the creek.
1701380	1703100	The ooze is killed by water.
1703100	1704100	Meow, meow.
1704100	1705100	Meow, meow.
1705100	1708460	We don't know, but the ooze does not lack the water.
1708460	1709460	Meow.
1709460	1713180	So we're making a run to Walmart and getting a bunch of super soakers.
1713940	1714940	Water balloons.
1714940	1715940	Oh my God.
1715940	1716940	Those kiddie pool.
1716940	1720120	Those guys are such assholes, but maybe we have to call the contention fire department.
1720120	1723340	Those pricks, every time they win softball, they're just dicks.
1723340	1729260	We should issue like an announcement to the city to stay in your bathtub or a pool or
1729260	1733180	you'll disappear.
1733180	1734860	Or your life is forfeit.
1734860	1737980	They might help with these angry mobs.
1737980	1741820	No, we can't, we don't have anything we can...
1741820	1742820	Sorry.
1743460	1748180	You're just like crunching chips and like moving the bag around.
1748180	1749180	It's impossible.
1749180	1756980	Keith, I don't know how you can eat those chips at a time like this.
1756980	1760020	This feels like we're moving towards a final game plan.
1760020	1761020	Really?
1761020	1762020	They're about to go bad.
1762020	1763740	The fact that like...
1763740	1764740	Keith would be eating chips.
1764740	1767700	That's exactly what I was just thinking.
1767700	1770460	Of course you guys are talking like, oh, it's a cat.
1770460	1771460	Is it afraid of water?
1771460	1777460	And you look back and Keith's just like, ah, no, no, no, that's faffenating.
1777460	1779660	He's trying to fit into those pants.
1779660	1780660	Oh yeah.
1780660	1783260	Yeah, so what do we do with this information?
1783260	1784260	Doug is the ooze.
1784260	1787020	Do you know if the ooze has an intelligence?
1787020	1788020	My mom, my mom, my mom.
1788020	1789820	Should we go to the mill?
1789820	1790820	Or James's.
1790820	1791820	Oh yeah.
1791820	1795700	That's where a bunch of shit went down at the last time we were together.
1795700	1799140	Wait, what about John Peter's secret room or was it James's secret room?
1799140	1800140	It was James's.
1800140	1801140	Oh, it was James's, yeah.
1801140	1805500	It was James's house, found weird writing in blood and guns all around.
1805500	1806500	Let's go there.
1806500	1807500	I didn't write down secret room in particular.
1807500	1809580	I think it was just that the guy went in there and saw it all.
1809580	1810580	It was James.
1810580	1811900	He worked at the mill.
1811900	1815860	He was last seen going into Maggie Cook's house.
1815860	1816860	Which one was he?
1816860	1819460	The one who ate his own foot or the chief's foot or the one who...
1819460	1822020	He was first seen with a vacuum in his front yard.
1822020	1823020	Yeah.
1823020	1824020	Oh, he's the galoshes guy.
1824020	1825020	Yep.
1825020	1826020	Already.
1826020	1828860	And then he was the one with the bullet in his head sitting at the dinner table.
1828860	1829860	Yeah.
1829860	1830860	Okay.
1830860	1831860	It was James's.
1831860	1832860	Doug, can you hold down the fort?
1832860	1833860	Meow.
1833860	1834860	Okay.
1834860	1835860	We could leave him a little tray of water and...
1835860	1841220	By the way, this whole time Drew is just like staring at this cat with his big ass gums
1841220	1842220	hanging out.
1842220	1843220	Oh, oh, oh.
1843220	1844220	That's stupid for me.
1844220	1845220	So rude.
1845220	1846220	Hey, Drew, this is Doug.
1846220	1847220	Doug, Drew.
1847220	1848220	Meow.
1848220	1849340	And Drew's just like, hi.
1849340	1852260	His voice gets normal for a second.
1852260	1857280	Drew, I know you've been through a lot today and so have we.
1857280	1861520	So just look after this cat and make sure nothing happens to it, would you?
1861520	1862520	Just trust us on this.
1862520	1863800	I mean, have we steered you wrong yet?
1863800	1864960	I will.
1864960	1867160	Thank you for trusting me, Clark.
1867160	1868160	You got it, bud.
1868160	1869160	I pat him on the back.
1869160	1871840	Hey, Drew, what's our secret word?
1871840	1872840	Bubble gum tree.
1872840	1873840	Bubble gum tree.
1873840	1874840	Yeah, bubble gum tree.
1874840	1875840	You could have just told that to the clones.
1875840	1877320	Oh, next time.
1877320	1878320	I'll get it next time.
1878320	1881200	And he pulls out his phone and your phone starts ringing.
1881200	1882200	My phone starts ringing?
1882200	1883200	And he's like, oh, okay, good.
1883200	1884200	It's you.
1884200	1885200	I answer him, bubble gum tree.
1886200	1888200	You're so funny, John.
1888200	1889200	Drew.
1889200	1892880	Okay, let's go to James's.
1892880	1897600	On your way to James the millworker's house, it's in the suburbs.
1897600	1902800	And on your way there, looking up into the sky on this chilly moonlit night, you see
1902800	1907640	a crop duster flying with sparkly lights all over the wings and tail.
1908160	1916360	And behind it is a massive banner that reads in bright lights, contention PD equals imbeciles.
1916360	1920760	I have never seen a protest get this fancy.
1920760	1923400	I've never seen contention united in such a way.
1923400	1924400	I know.
1924400	1928240	It would be heartwarming if it wasn't a united hate of us.
1928240	1930560	Fuck them.
1930560	1931560	That's impressive.
1931560	1932560	That's impressive, though.
1932560	1934760	I got to give it up to whoever ordered that plane.
1934760	1936320	Can I call Mr. Klinker?
1936320	1937320	Is it Harry?
1938000	1939400	Can I call Harry real quick?
1939400	1944800	The phone rings until you think that it's going to go to voicemail, and then it clicks
1944800	1945800	and you hear.
1945800	1946800	Clark.
1946800	1947800	Hey.
1947800	1948800	Hey, Harry.
1948800	1949800	It's Clark.
1949800	1950800	How you doing?
1950800	1951800	I'm well.
1951800	1955640	You, uh, you seen all that rabble outside?
1955640	1956640	People seem pretty mad at us.
1956640	1957640	You know about that?
1957640	1958640	Yeah.
1958640	1961360	I was hoping you might be able to put out the good word amongst the patrons there that
1961360	1964560	maybe we're onto something here and have some patience for us.
1964560	1965560	Hey, Officer Bishop.
1965560	1969440	You know, uh, Klinker's is always a safe place for you and your kind.
1969440	1970440	I dig it.
1970440	1971440	I was just...
1971440	1973800	I met you and, uh, the other officers.
1973800	1974800	Not bishops.
1974800	1975800	Oh.
1975800	1977800	I hate the church.
1977800	1980080	I knew what you meant, Harry.
1980080	1981080	I thank you for that.
1981080	1984200	I just, I just was hoping that maybe if anybody came in there and they were grumbling about
1984200	1987760	all the stupid pigs and blah, blah, blah, you might tell them that we're just some good
1987760	1991440	old friends of yours and that you trust us and that maybe...
1991440	1995400	Gary and I have been trying to put out the word that you boys are just trying your hardest
1995400	1996400	and, uh...
1996400	1997400	I appreciate that.
1997400	2001440	I've got an idea about another phone call we could make because I'm, I'm, this is, this
2001440	2002440	seems to have been...
2002440	2003440	Oh, are we still on the call?
2003440	2004440	Sorry, John was talking.
2004440	2005440	Sorry.
2005440	2006440	Uh, hey Harry.
2006440	2007440	Hey.
2007440	2008440	Tell Harry, hey.
2008440	2009440	Hey, John.
2009440	2010440	I mean, Clark.
2010440	2011440	Tell Harry I say hi.
2011440	2012440	How long have we been playing this game?
2012440	2013440	Uh...
2013440	2014440	Three days.
2015440	2020440	Harry, I'm glad to hear that.
2020440	2028440	I just, uh, just wanted to touch base with you and make sure that you knew we were doing
2028440	2030440	what we can to help out the town.
2030440	2032440	I appreciate that, Clark.
2032440	2034440	All right, good talking.
2034440	2035440	Bye.
2035440	2037940	I think maybe we should make one of those calls to the pastor too.
2037940	2040240	That's not me though, because I don't think he likes me that much.
2040240	2042560	That's exactly what I was about to say, you ideal steamed son of a bitch.
2042560	2044280	Well, he said it earlier.
2044280	2045280	He did.
2045280	2046280	Really?
2046280	2047280	Yeah.
2047280	2048280	Oh, well.
2048280	2050280	Okay, edit that part out.
2050280	2053280	Edit that part out, edit out the part when he said it earlier.
2053280	2054280	Yeah.
2054280	2056280	Hey guys, I think we should call the pastor.
2056280	2059280	Just edit everything out until we're at the...
2059280	2061280	Good idea, John.
2061280	2066280	Yeah, that podcast was fine until that weird episode just started with him yelling.
2066280	2069280	Yeah, Thomas was just yelling at everybody.
2069280	2070280	Yeah, call the pastor.
2070280	2071280	Oh, is it staying?
2071280	2072280	Call the pastor.
2073280	2074280	Okay, anyway.
2074280	2075280	Who's calling the pastor?
2075280	2076280	I'll call the...
2076280	2077280	Yeah, Keith shouldn't call the pastor.
2077280	2078280	No.
2078280	2079280	I'll call the pastor.
2079280	2080280	Bring, bring.
2080280	2081280	Bring, bring.
2081280	2086280	When you call his office and when you call his home, both calls go to voicemail.
2086280	2089280	Uh, hey, pastor.
2089280	2094280	Uh, this is John Lee Pettymore III from Contention PD.
2094280	2098280	Uh, just wanted to talk to you when you have a moment.
2098280	2102280	Please give us a call back regarding these angry mobs.
2102280	2103280	Thank you.
2103280	2104280	Bye.
2104280	2105280	Have a blessed day.
2105280	2106280	That was good.
2106280	2110280	Anyway, I do think that the pastor organized all this trouble against us because he seems
2110280	2112280	like he can get this town going.
2112280	2118280	He's got the resources and Keith did so horribly insult him and steal his helmet.
2121280	2123280	Let's go to James' house.
2123280	2125280	Alright, let's take a break real quick.
2128280	2143280	No, my penis is bigger than an eighth of an inch.
2143280	2144280	I'm pretty sure.
2144280	2146280	I don't think it would even be...
2146280	2147280	Prove it.
2147280	2148280	Yeah, prove it.
2148280	2157280	He thought so hard about showing us his dick for a bit.
2157280	2158280	Just ask around.
2158280	2163280	I feel like there was a 40% chance we almost saw Luke's dick there.
2163280	2167280	If I had a couple more schlitzes in me.
2167280	2170280	Or a couple more inches.
2170280	2173280	Okay, so you guys are...
2173280	2176280	Actually, the only reason I have back problems is...
2176280	2180280	Because of my massive tongue.
2180280	2183280	Dude, you know how I make my penis eight inches long?
2183280	2186280	I fold it in half.
2186280	2187280	Gross.
2187280	2190280	That would mean I have a flaccid 16 inch penis.
2190280	2193280	Horribly way too long.
2193280	2197280	I'm not going to try right now, but I don't think even totally soft I could fold my penis
2197280	2198280	in half.
2198280	2201280	Oh, well then my penis is bigger than yours.
2201280	2205280	No, I just mean I don't think it would fold back on itself that much.
2205280	2207280	I don't think it's pliable enough to...
2207280	2208280	I think mine would.
2208280	2211280	Yeah, I can do that.
2211280	2212280	I can definitely do that.
2212280	2213280	Can you guys go wash your hands?
2213280	2214280	I can do it.
2214280	2215280	I can do it.
2215280	2216280	I folded my penis in half.
2216280	2217280	Okay.
2217280	2219280	I took a shower right before I came over here.
2219280	2220280	It was actually really easy.
2220280	2222280	I guess a soft dick is very soft.
2222280	2224280	Zach, I didn't fold my penis in half.
2224280	2225280	Thank you.
2225280	2226280	Do it.
2226280	2228280	I like to tie mine in a ribbon.
2228280	2232280	So, your characters are having this conversation after...
2232280	2237280	It's a good thing Clark didn't because he would have taken his hands off the wheel.
2237280	2240280	Hey, I'm driving it, aren't I?
2240280	2241280	It's my fucking cruiser.
2241280	2242280	Well, we're in your cruiser.
2242280	2243280	I don't know if you're driving.
2243280	2244280	I think he's driving.
2244280	2245280	Yeah, I think I said that I was.
2245280	2246280	I was sick of you.
2246280	2247280	Are you driving?
2247280	2248280	Okay.
2248280	2249280	Okay.
2249280	2250280	And you guys are having this conversation.
2250280	2256280	Clark just wrapped up a phone call and then John called the pastor twice and left a message.
2256280	2260280	Guys, I don't think we can calm down this mob.
2260280	2262280	We can only incite this mob.
2262280	2265280	Yeah, well then what do we do?
2265280	2269280	The best thing we can do is solve this case.
2269280	2271280	I hadn't even thought about doing that.
2271280	2277280	If we get this case cracked, get these people found, or at least some answers for the good
2277280	2280280	folks at contention, I think that'll get them out of the streets.
2280280	2281280	I agree.
2281280	2283280	We can only push forward at this point.
2283280	2287280	Also, we need to get Florence on the phones calling everybody who called about a lost
2287280	2289280	pet and telling them to get their ass down to the creek.
2289280	2291280	And also, fuck, we need to...
2291280	2292280	You know what?
2292280	2293280	Okay.
2293280	2294280	Hold up.
2294280	2300280	We talked a little bit earlier about telling everybody to get into a bathtub full of water.
2300280	2302280	Oh shit, we need the feds.
2302280	2303280	Yeah, we need to get like a...
2303280	2305280	Because they don't trust our authority right now.
2305280	2309280	But if the feds came to contention or at least issued some kind of order...
2309280	2313280	If we could do like an emergency broadcast system...
2313280	2314280	And it would.
2314280	2316280	I mean, people do need to be in their bathtubs or in the creek.
2316280	2319280	They could get in the creek with the animals and have a little animal party.
2319280	2320280	Oh shit, it's December though.
2320280	2322280	It's starting to turn to...
2322280	2325280	You think it's going to get pretty cold in these next couple days.
2325280	2326280	How about this?
2326280	2333280	Let's see if we have some funds put back to buy big kiddie pools for contention.
2333280	2335280	Keith, let me stop you right there.
2335280	2337280	We don't have any funds allocated for that.
2337280	2338280	That is not in the budget.
2338280	2341280	I know how we can get some funds.
2341280	2342280	What you thinking?
2342280	2346280	We do have a massive stash of...
2346280	2347280	Guns.
2347280	2349280	And white gold, if you know what I'm talking about.
2349280	2350280	Keith!
2350280	2352280	We're police.
2352280	2353280	With no money.
2353280	2355280	I can't believe you would suggest such a thing.
2355280	2358280	I'm shutting down conversation on this right now, Keith.
2358280	2359280	I'm not comfortable with this.
2359280	2364280	More people will die in contention than will die from cocaine overdose.
2364280	2369280	So we need to not be worrying about selling cocaine tonight and we need to be solving this case.
2369280	2370280	If you say so.
2370280	2371280	I do say so.
2371280	2374280	Speaking of which, I pull a little baggie out of my pocket and...
2374280	2376280	Well, okay, pass that over here.
2376280	2377280	Roll a D6.
2377280	2379280	Oh my god, guys, I haven't had a joint in like three days.
2379280	2380280	Three hours.
2380280	2382280	Alright, you're good for three more hours.
2382280	2384280	You won't have the negative 20 anymore.
2384280	2386280	Do I get a bonus if I take a bump?
2386280	2388280	Or what's if John Lee Pettymore is gonna take a bump?
2388280	2389280	But I don't know.
2389280	2391280	Yeah, you get an actual bonus.
2391280	2397280	Keith, because he's only at one willpower, his cocaine habit just negates.
2397280	2398280	My minus 20.
2398280	2400280	So yeah, I toss the baggie over to you.
2400280	2403280	Maybe I should get a malice to charm though or something.
2403280	2404280	That guy never shuts up.
2404280	2407280	He's just talking and talking and talking.
2407280	2408280	Is he on cocaine?
2408280	2409280	Four.
2409280	2410280	Alright, get four willpower back.
2410280	2411280	Oh, that actually really...
2411280	2413280	I forgot how down on willpower it was.
2413280	2414280	That helps a lot.
2414280	2415280	I went from six to eight.
2415280	2416280	Oh, wait.
2416280	2417280	I don't know.
2417280	2418280	I went from six to ten.
2418280	2420280	I'm back up to one, correct?
2420280	2421280	That is correct.
2421280	2422280	Math.
2422280	2423280	Oh, I did not...
2423280	2426280	Oh, and then I regain to two hit points, right?
2426280	2427280	Yeah, you should be at 20 health.
2427280	2428280	But I got one willpower.
2428280	2429280	Cool.
2429280	2430280	Clark.
2430280	2432280	I'm stink eyeing the hell out of him from the backseat.
2432280	2433280	Thank you.
2433280	2434280	I don't say anything though.
2434280	2435280	Okay.
2435280	2437280	Because me and Keith already had our peace on that.
2437280	2442280	So you guys are doing cocaine and Clark is stink eyeing you.
2442280	2443880	Not speaking a word.
2443880	2444880	As you guys pull up...
2444880	2448280	I'm probably even doing some real passive aggressive...
2448280	2449280	Bishop.
2449280	2450280	Rolling eyes real hard.
2450280	2451280	Hey, Bishop.
2451280	2452280	Look at me, man.
2452280	2453280	Tonight...
2453280	2454280	Reluctantly kind of shifting on it.
2454280	2457280	Tonight could be the last night of any of our lives.
2457280	2459280	And there is an evil loose in contention.
2459280	2463280	I mean, it's not the time for procedure, buddy.
2463280	2464280	You know what?
2464280	2468360	And this might be your argument and I can predict it and I'm on cocaine, but maybe now
2468360	2475480	is exactly the time for procedure.
2475480	2478680	The cocaine is going to John Lee Pennymore's head.
2478680	2479680	Role playing's hard.
2479680	2482960	I roll down my window.
2482960	2484360	Just listen to J.J.
2484360	2485360	Kale, buddy.
2485360	2496800	And that plays as we pull up to James' house.
2497800	2502880	Clark, just kick back and enjoy the ride, buddy, because life's not a guarantee.
2502880	2508840	I look back at Clark, give him a kind of an I'm sorry look and then a wink and then sirens
2508840	2511160	on speeding as fast as I can.
2511160	2514720	Down the street that the house is on, where are you parking?
2514720	2518760	In the yard.
2518760	2519760	Describe it.
2519760	2525280	I go into the driveway at an angle and just keep going all the way up to where the passenger
2525280	2531240	door of the police cruiser is like you need to take a step and a half to get into the
2531240	2532440	front door.
2532440	2537040	I roll out of my door as the car is still moving a little bit and I preemptively fire
2537040	2541000	two shots in the air to disperse any potential crowds.
2541000	2543120	Okay, sounds good.
2543120	2547440	People who actually do cocaine are like, you guys.
2547440	2553640	The car pulls up to a very rough stop right in front of the front door.
2553640	2556200	Everyone rolls out, fires two shots in the air.
2556200	2558440	Oh, whoa, John, what the fuck?
2558440	2560200	We're rolling, baby.
2560200	2564600	Let's fucking survey the neighborhood.
2564600	2566760	Like any reaction?
2566760	2569360	Cocaine.
2569360	2573360	As you look about the neighborhood, go ahead and roll search for me.
2573360	2576760	Uh, fail, 98 on a 20.
2576760	2578520	Uh, yeah, no, neighborhood is quiet.
2578520	2581680	Dude, Keith and I get dope alertness bonuses.
2581680	2583240	I probably just am normal.
2583240	2585360	Keith gets a negative 20 to all roles.
2585360	2586360	Gotcha.
2586360	2591760	He gets to stand, he gets to stand up and talk and move around and stuff.
2591760	2593480	I'm not at negative 20 still am I?
2593480	2594480	Oh, that's correct.
2594480	2595480	You're no longer.
2595480	2596480	Because I did drugs.
2596480	2598480	I am so sorry.
2598480	2600760	But you're definitely not at a bonus.
2600760	2608600	And the front door opens and you see an old man, a slightly bent over wearing a fancy
2608600	2610280	blue three piece suit.
2610280	2611280	Whoa man.
2611280	2613520	I got to point my gun right at him.
2613520	2615240	What are you doing in this guy's house?
2615240	2618240	Answer right now.
2618240	2624800	How do you know James?
2624800	2628440	I shouldn't have told you his name, that gave you a valuable clue if you were trying to
2628440	2629440	lie to us.
2629440	2630440	I'm the...
2630440	2634140	And he's having a hard time saying it because you got a gun pointed at him and he's a terrified
2634140	2635140	old man.
2635140	2637200	I don't see any threat so I raise the gun.
2637200	2641400	As soon as you raise it, he spits out, I'm the estate salesman.
2641400	2643880	Oh, hey buddy.
2643880	2646320	Hey guys, he called us.
2646320	2647320	Yeah, I remember.
2647320	2648320	Oh.
2648320	2649520	We were just goofing with you.
2649520	2650680	Yeah, just new boot goofing.
2650680	2653920	Oh, that was a very terrible joke.
2653920	2656160	And you walk up to him, he is...
2656160	2657520	We're cops, not comedians.
2657520	2662920	He's holding a cane that has a big tooth on the top where he's holding it.
2662920	2663920	Like a fake tooth or a...
2663920	2667400	A big fake tooth, like a giant that fits his entire fist.
2667400	2668880	Right, like a just molar.
2668880	2672360	Yeah, it's huge and it's on top of his cane and he...
2672360	2674360	Hey buddy, what's up with your tooth cane?
2674360	2678840	Oh, well, my name is Randy Angst.
2678840	2680040	And he hands you a card.
2680040	2681600	I don't see how that...
2681600	2682600	Yeah, I don't...
2682600	2691560	Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, founder of the Contention Historical Society, lover.
2691560	2693120	That last one's important.
2693120	2694720	Are you hitting on us?
2694720	2696360	I bet you get a lot of play.
2696360	2698280	Then it's got his phone number and his email.
2698280	2699280	This is his email.
2699280	2702120	Hey guys, I think the founder of the Contention Historical Society might be able to give us
2702120	2703120	some clues.
2703120	2704440	Do we still have those pictures?
2704440	2705440	Or do we have...
2705440	2706440	Pictures of what?
2706440	2707520	I'm talking to Zach.
2707520	2708520	This is Thomas.
2708520	2709520	I'm not Zach.
2709520	2710520	I'm Randy.
2710520	2711520	I'm sorry, Randy.
2711520	2712520	I'm on a lot of cocaine.
2712520	2713520	Who's Thomas?
2713520	2714520	69.
2714520	2715520	God.
2715520	2726480	He actually rolled 69.
2726480	2730320	Is it conceivable that we have copies of those pictures on our phones?
2730320	2735240	I think you would absolutely have pictures of the pictures.
2735240	2736240	Okay.
2736240	2737240	Mr. Angst.
2737240	2738240	Dr. Angst?
2738240	2739240	DDS?
2739240	2740240	It doesn't say DDS.
2740240	2741240	It just says dentist.
2741240	2742240	Nope.
2742240	2743240	You can just call me Randy.
2743240	2744240	Okay, Randy.
2744240	2745720	These aren't real doctors.
2745720	2746720	Wow.
2746720	2747720	A self hating...
2747720	2748720	An anti-dentite.
2748720	2749720	An anti-dentite.
2749720	2750720	Yeah.
2750720	2751720	Yeah.
2751720	2765520	Why else was surprised that the John Lee Pettymore has seen Seinfeld?
2765520	2766760	You thought I came up with that?
2766760	2767760	I thought you did.
2767760	2768760	Oh, gosh.
2768760	2769760	It's just a reference.
2769760	2773760	I was like, shit dude, Thomas is way funnier than I thought he was.
2774280	2779480	Yeah, I would have been.
2779480	2786640	Randy, I've got a picture here of a strange building and some people in old time of clothes.
2786640	2787880	I'm not going to say it's essential to...
2787880	2789880	Do you want to come in?
2789880	2792160	No.
2792160	2793440	I want to show you this picture right here.
2793440	2796400	There's some very spooky stuff happening inside.
2796400	2799520	I think you might want to come in.
2799520	2804800	I don't know if these pictures are spooky, but I can guarantee you, there's some spooky
2804800	2806520	doings in this hoose.
2806520	2807520	Hoose.
2807520	2810200	A very old school Anglo Saxon.
2810200	2811200	Thank you.
2811200	2812200	Yeah.
2812200	2813200	Randy.
2813200	2818580	Randy, there's spooky stuff inside that house, outside that house.
2818580	2820400	This whole town is beset with it.
2820400	2824200	But do you recognize the building these people are standing in front of?
2824200	2826920	And I show them the picture of the people in front of the jet black building.
2826920	2830440	Okay, so basically that building, it's literally just a wall.
2830440	2831560	It's just a black wall.
2831560	2833840	You can't actually see the building at large.
2833840	2835760	Do you recognize any of the people in this picture?
2835760	2838440	Are they contention founders, forefathers?
2838440	2846960	Well, I do see that the clothing is anachronistically correct with the time period of the founding
2846960	2850200	of contention in many of these cases.
2850200	2851800	As he points to some of the people.
2851800	2852800	Anachronistically.
2852800	2854840	It means it came from a tree.
2854840	2859160	It means the time period was from a tree.
2859160	2860160	It means it was wrong.
2860160	2861240	It's like a family tree.
2861240	2866080	Do you mean that people in this photo have clothing anachronistic to one another or to
2866080	2868760	the time period of contention's founding?
2868760	2869760	Both.
2869760	2870760	Okay.
2870760	2871760	Can you show us an example in this picture?
2871760	2873360	Who's wearing clothes that they shouldn't be?
2873360	2878260	These three are wearing clothes from a different time period as the rest of them.
2878260	2880600	You can tell by the stitching.
2880600	2881600	How different?
2881600	2883640	Oh, a hundred years or so probably.
2883640	2885760	This must be a reenactment of some sort.
2885760	2887720	Mr. Anx, that's very helpful.
2887720	2888720	Thank you.
2888720	2889720	I'm a helpful guy.
2889720	2891360	Just ask my lady friends.
2891360	2892360	Mr. Anx.
2892360	2893360	And my man friends.
2893360	2894360	All right.
2894360	2895360	We'll save it for NPR.
2895360	2898100	Do you remember an old orphanage in town called Cole's Orphanage?
2898100	2899880	Can we go inside, please?
2899880	2902060	It's very cold out.
2902060	2903360	You are quite old.
2903360	2904360	Let's go inside.
2904360	2905360	Thank you.
2905360	2907300	I brush past.
2907300	2908300	What is this guy's name?
2908300	2909300	Randy?
2909300	2910300	Randy Anx.
2911300	2914020	Not waiting for him to get out of the way, I just kind of blow by him.
2914020	2915020	Okay.
2915020	2917780	I mean, he did just invite you in, so.
2917780	2918780	Yeah.
2918780	2920380	You're doing what he asked you to do.
2920380	2925000	As he goes in, he kind of pats you, Clark, on the shoulder and he says, now as we're
2925000	2931340	headed inside into the warmth of this nice home in this weird place, you asked about
2931340	2932340	a orphanage.
2932340	2933340	Yeah.
2933340	2935340	It was called Cole's Orphanage.
2935340	2936340	Yeah.
2936340	2937340	Yeah.
2937340	2938340	I remember.
2938380	2940300	And he always remembers.
2940300	2942020	Do you remember?
2942020	2943020	Can you?
2943020	2944020	Keith.
2944020	2945020	Come on, buddy.
2945020	2946820	That song's a little after my time.
2946820	2948140	You can see he's quite old.
2948140	2949940	He doesn't know September.
2949940	2951700	Can you tell me a little bit about it?
2951700	2955100	We talked to some folks in town who had no recollection of it.
2955100	2956100	Yes.
2956100	2957620	It was not around for very long.
2957620	2964340	It is a little piece of trivia I keep in the back just in case someone needs to know it
2964340	2965740	at trivia.
2965740	2966740	What about it?
2966740	2967740	What is trivial?
2968140	2969140	Well, everything.
2969140	2970140	It opened.
2970140	2971140	It closed.
2971140	2972140	How quickly?
2972140	2973140	Very quickly.
2973140	2974220	I would say less than a year.
2974220	2975220	What year?
2975220	2977580	Oh, it was 25 years ago probably.
2977580	2978780	Somewhere about then.
2978780	2984620	25 minus the current year equals the early 90s and age.
2984620	2987660	Do you remember who opened up that place?
2987660	2988660	Um.
2988660	2989660	Cole.
2989660	2990900	Well, no.
2990900	2991900	She would have been...
2991900	2992900	He would have...
2992900	2994900	Either one of them would have been long dead by that point.
2994900	2995900	The Coles?
2995900	2996900	Yes.
2997060	3000660	They were dead by the time their namesake orphanage opened up?
3000660	3001660	Oh, absolutely.
3001660	3003380	Who named it for them?
3003380	3012060	There are many things in our town named after our founder and his wife, Silas Cole and Mary
3012060	3013060	Cole.
3013060	3014060	I get that.
3014060	3015060	I just wondered if you know who opened it.
3015060	3016060	Oh, no.
3016060	3017060	I don't remember.
3017060	3018060	Wasn't this town founded by beans?
3018060	3019060	Well, that's a point of contention.
3019060	3020060	Contention.
3020060	3021060	Hell yeah.
3021060	3024860	Did Silas Cole and what was his name?
3024860	3025860	Was it...
3026820	3027820	Cornelius?
3027820	3028820	Cornelius Beans.
3028820	3031900	Oh, what a mind you have on you, young sir.
3031900	3034860	I read a book or two.
3034860	3037240	I believe you read the right ones.
3037240	3040620	Do you remember where in contention Cole's orphanage was?
3040620	3043620	Well, the town has changed quite a bit since then.
3043620	3046660	I don't remember where it was now.
3046660	3051100	We could probably find more back at my research facility.
3051100	3052700	A resource facility?
3052700	3053940	Yes.
3053940	3057060	It's where all of my research is hosed.
3057060	3058060	Sorry.
3058060	3062320	It's where all of my research is re- fuck.
3062320	3065100	It's where all of my research is hosed.
3065100	3067140	Try it one more time.
3067140	3068260	Yes, of course.
3068260	3071420	It's where all of my research is hosed.
3071420	3075220	That makes sense to me.
3075220	3082980	So come on in and you guys walk into this incredibly nice and clean house.
3083020	3086500	And as you walk in there's a nice foyer in front of you.
3086500	3089940	And then to the right there's this huge living room.
3089940	3097260	And in the living room, well here in the foyer there is a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo.
3097260	3101100	And also there is a suit of armor.
3101100	3105780	And the helmet has been replaced with a white hard hat.
3105780	3108620	In the living room there is an empty grand piano.
3108620	3112960	And there's also a large oil painting of a red rose.
3112960	3117100	And he brings you over to the statue of the man wearing a tuxedo.
3117100	3121200	And he says, check this sweet shit out.
3121200	3125520	And he grabs the statue's bow tie and flips it.
3125520	3131360	And the coffee table in the living room flips over showing an enormous stash of weapons,
3131360	3136280	body armor, and a long plastic tube the size of a baseball bat.
3136280	3144560	And written in blood where one of the guns should be, it says, stop her.
3144560	3148080	I was pointing out the large plastic tube the shape of a baseball bat.
3148080	3150980	The size behind you.
3150980	3155160	There is an Ozzie Smith signed baseball bat in the room that we're in.
3155160	3157560	It's in a tube that size.
3157560	3162000	We are also in a completely St. Louis Cardinals themed room.
3162000	3163000	Fuck yeah dude.
3163000	3166320	There's an old drawing of, is that Old Bush Stadium?
3166320	3167320	No.
3167320	3168320	No that's New Bush.
3168320	3169320	That's New Bush Stadium.
3169320	3170800	It's a seat from Old Bush behind me.
3170800	3171800	There is.
3171800	3172800	Cornelius?
3172800	3173800	The third one.
3173800	3174800	Not Cornelius, fuck.
3174800	3176800	My name is Cornelius or is it?
3176800	3177800	Ooh.
3177800	3178800	Uh, guys.
3178800	3179800	Wait, is your name not Randy?
3179800	3180800	No, it's Randy.
3180800	3184520	Randy, uh, is your middle name Cornelius?
3184520	3185520	No.
3185520	3188040	Is this statue of somebody significant to the town?
3188040	3189960	No, I don't know who this is.
3189960	3192680	Can we huddle around real quick outside of Randy?
3192680	3196680	I mean, he actually, Randy can hear this, but I think we need to document this all.
3196680	3200920	Take some pictures real quick with our phones and then suit the fuck up with this shit.
3200920	3204400	Yeah, I'm gonna put body armor, like weapons.
3204400	3205400	Let's get loaded guys.
3205400	3210880	Yeah, uh, Randy, we're gonna take this for, um, you know, purposes.
3210880	3211880	Vital operations.
3211880	3212880	I don't think he cares.
3212880	3213880	Police purposes.
3213880	3214880	Hey, the estate will be compensated.
3214880	3219520	Honestly, hey, you know what Randy, I don't think this is in his will so that's why you
3219520	3220520	called us, right?
3220520	3221520	Oh, his will was very non-existent.
3221520	3222520	Okay.
3222560	3223560	Let's get into the game real quick.
3223560	3225520	He did call us because he wanted to know if he could sell it all.
3225520	3226520	The answer is a fucking no?
3226520	3227520	Oh yeah.
3227520	3228520	Hey man, I'm sorry.
3228520	3229520	This is all part of an ongoing investigation.
3229520	3232480	We're actually going to load some of this up in our cruiser right now so we can take
3232480	3234320	it to evidence as quickly as possible.
3234320	3235320	Oh no.
3235320	3237320	He can sell the cool statue, buddy.
3237320	3238320	Oh good.
3238320	3240320	Hey Randy, do you like cocaine?
3240320	3242320	Does the Pope shit in the woods?
3242320	3243320	I think so.
3243320	3244320	Yeah.
3244320	3245320	Hey Keith, give him, give him some of that.
3245320	3246320	Yay.
3246320	3247320	Just share your cocaine.
3247320	3248320	Just kidding.
3248320	3250640	We are police officers of the law.
3250640	3252800	Keith, this is the end of the fucking world.
3252800	3253800	Give him some cocaine.
3253800	3254800	Wait.
3254800	3255800	You know what I mean?
3255800	3256800	It's the what?
3256800	3257800	Nothing.
3257800	3258800	I feel fine.
3258800	3261000	You're going to feel a lot more fine if Keith would learn to share.
3261000	3262840	Five o'clock TV hour.
3262840	3264520	You know what?
3264520	3269520	It's probably past my years to do an upper like cocaine.
3269520	3270920	It might stop my heart.
3270920	3273000	It says lover on this card.
3273000	3274000	Yes.
3274000	3275200	That says to me that you do cocaine.
3275200	3278880	Do you know if cocaine reacts poorly with Cialis?
3278880	3281480	Oh you want Cialis right now?
3281480	3282480	I'll never not.
3282480	3285840	Don't you see his raging erection under his very loose pants?
3285840	3288000	It says lover right there on the card.
3288000	3294480	There is a full blown sideways tint going on on Randy Yanks and he immediately turns
3294480	3296400	and- Randy's got nothing to be ashamed of.
3296400	3299760	He turns and shows you.
3299760	3303920	Is sideways tint a tint that Merlot's not allowed in?
3303920	3304920	Nice dude.
3304960	3309960	That scene in fucking sideways tanked the Merlot industry for like a number of years.
3309960	3313080	Because they didn't explain that- It's actually because it's all his ex-wife
3313080	3314080	drank.
3314080	3316080	I'm fine with all varieties of red wine.
3316080	3317080	Hey did you know that Randy?
3317080	3318080	Randy did you know that?
3318080	3320040	Merlot's my third favorite.
3320040	3326640	Now we are realistically role playing cocaine.
3326640	3328960	Anyway I'm- I think we should also take that oil thing.
3328960	3331280	So you're saying I can't sell these guns?
3331280	3332280	No.
3332280	3333280	They're ours now.
3333760	3335720	Is this the only thing you wanted us to see in this house?
3335720	3336800	You said it was spooky.
3336800	3342400	He walks over and grabs the- or he like reaches for the oil painting and he's like can I sell
3342400	3343400	this?
3343400	3346840	If you move that painting is it gonna unveil another room?
3346840	3347840	Another what?
3347840	3349040	A secret place?
3349040	3350040	Or anything?
3350040	3352160	Yeah what happens when you move that painting?
3352160	3353280	Why would you ask us that?
3353280	3355980	Why would you want me to move- wait what is happening?
3355980	3356980	Can I sell it?
3356980	3358600	Why would you ask us if you can sell it?
3358600	3362040	Because I'm wanting to know if all of these things are from an active crime scene or if
3362040	3365920	I can sell the other stuff that isn't the guns, Keith.
3372160	3374000	Oh you just got the angst.
3374000	3379440	I grab one of the guns and I like am pointing at him and I'm like I don't see why you wouldn't
3379440	3381520	be able to sell that painting.
3381520	3384320	That's- what a weird vibe you're putting off there.
3384320	3389200	You guys begin to smell the faint smell of shit.
3389880	3392680	Give him some cocaine now man you made him shit his pants.
3392680	3393680	Come on.
3393680	3394680	I'm gonna excuse myself.
3394680	3397160	Hey do you want to shoot some of these guns before we leave?
3397160	3399160	Yeah do you want to do that?
3399160	3402000	Yes but I do need to clean up a bit first.
3402000	3403000	That's understandable.
3403000	3404000	And he walks off to the bathroom.
3404000	3405240	Wait wait Randy wait real fast before you leave.
3405240	3406880	He pokes his head back around the corner.
3406880	3410840	John did ask you like is there anything else here that you wanted us to see?
3410840	3414000	What do you mean I'm just gonna point at a bunch of stuff and ask you if I can sell it
3414000	3415640	as soon as I get out of the bathroom.
3415640	3417220	Is anything else fucking weird?
3417220	3420860	Does anything else lead to a gun door or something of that ilk?
3420860	3423300	That is the only trapsie that I found.
3423300	3424300	You call them trapsies?
3424300	3425380	What do you call them?
3425380	3427060	I've never thought of the word I would call them.
3427060	3428060	Go change your fucking britches.
3428060	3429060	That's just making me mad.
3429060	3433880	Yeah it does smell like shit in here Randy so if you could come back we can do some cocaine.
3433880	3434880	It's not my fault.
3434880	3435880	And he walks away.
3435880	3440380	You guys shitting himself just making me mad.
3440380	3446700	This whole house smells like shit.
3446700	3449020	What kind of guns are we dealing with here?
3449020	3450020	Well there's that.
3450020	3451020	Let's do that first.
3451020	3452020	Long ones.
3452020	3453020	Short ones.
3453020	3454020	Fat ones.
3454020	3455020	Tall ones.
3455020	3456020	Red ones.
3456020	3457020	Brown ones.
3457020	3458020	Sad ones.
3458020	3459020	Clown ones.
3459020	3460020	I got sniper rifle.
3460020	3461020	Assault rifle.
3461020	3462020	Six pistols and four body armors.
3462020	3463020	Yeah there's a bunch.
3463020	3464220	Yeah there's that.
3464220	3467620	Which should we let him shoot as a consolation prize for making him shoot his pants?
3467620	3468620	Let's let him pick.
3468620	3469620	Yeah.
3469620	3472500	While they're going through the guns I want to walk over to that painting and run my hand
3472500	3476060	around the edge of it and look for any kind of clicking mechanism.
3476420	3482220	Oh yeah let's move everything that's as conspicuous as a tuxedo statue or a rose oil painting
3482220	3483220	in this house.
3483220	3489940	Like Clark you walk over to the oil painting of the rose and as you put your fingers behind
3489940	3494220	it you actually feel space right behind the painting.
3494220	3498380	I pull that bad bitch down off the wall.
3498380	3504020	Behind the oil painting is a small hideaway big enough for one or two people.
3504020	3509860	Inside there are multiple kinds of spray bottles as well as different types of gloves
3509860	3511300	and materials.
3511300	3517580	There's also a list and on this list is materials and those materials are inside.
3517580	3520400	I got a room in here.
3520400	3521780	It's got a whole bunch of stuff.
3521780	3526940	It's got some tap water, some distilled water, some boiling water, some Windex, some CLR,
3526940	3533660	some soap, some bleach, some vinegar, some Drano, the works, coca-cola, and oil.
3533660	3538260	It's also got a whole bunch of like cotton and latex and vinyl and plastic and aluminum
3538260	3543420	and neoprene and lead and salt and candy and meat and ammonium nitrate.
3543420	3547060	I don't know about making bombs but...
3547060	3550020	Is there a chance that neoprene isn't in here?
3550020	3553320	For some reason on this list neoprene is the only thing that isn't crossed off.
3553320	3556760	This is the year of the terrible neoprene shortage.
3556760	3557760	What is neoprene?
3557760	3559100	I don't actually know that.
3559100	3561060	Neoprene is just a synthesized rubber.
3561960	3563780	Let me make sure that's correct.
3563780	3568980	Neoprene, also polychloroprene or PC rubber.
3568980	3574020	It's a family of synthetic rubbers that are produced by polymerization of chloroprene.
3574020	3575020	Cool.
3575020	3576300	The more you know.
3576300	3580940	Everything is labeled and there is a pair of neoprene gloves.
3580940	3583300	So everything's crossed off except neoprene?
3583300	3584300	Is there...
3584300	3586540	I can't discern why that would be.
3586540	3592200	If we do a Google search for like a number of these ingredients in concert, does a recipe
3592200	3593620	or anything pop up?
3593620	3594620	Nope.
3594620	3596060	Do you fellas know what CLR is?
3596060	3597060	Should I know what CLR is?
3597060	3600900	It's Calcium Lime and Rust Remover.
3600900	3601900	It gets rid of that stuff?
3601900	3602940	It gets rid of that stuff.
3602940	3603940	Also the works cleans the toilet.
3603940	3606100	Hey, CLR is a great product.
3606100	3610740	All listeners of pretending to be people, if you can go down to your local Walgreens,
3610740	3614960	get some CLR, it'll clean your calcium, your lime, your rust.
3614960	3616760	It's going to clean that bathtub up real good.
3616760	3619440	Your sink, I think you can use it on metal too, right?
3619440	3620440	That's the rust part.
3620440	3622840	Yeah, you got any white spots on your taps?
3622840	3625800	White spots, brown spots, yellow spots, red spots.
3625800	3630680	Put some CLR, mix it in with some water and just soak your shower head.
3630680	3633960	Your shower head's got some calcium on there, just soak it in there for a minute.
3633960	3634960	Pretending to be people.
3634960	3638520	You're going to have some good water flow here in about two or three minutes.
3638520	3639520	Oh, yeah.
3639520	3641220	You dip your shower head in some CLR.
3641220	3642220	That's a dream, man.
3642220	3643220	High power.
3643220	3644760	Surely it doesn't work on grease spots.
3644760	3647720	Oh, but that's where you would be wrong.
3647720	3650920	Can you roll to see if that all makes it in?
3650920	3651920	What am I rolling against?
3651920	3657960	No, because if it shows it, I don't know what CLR is.
3657960	3658960	It's a brain name.
3658960	3662440	Yeah, and it's not necessarily something you have to know.
3662440	3669520	Okay, also, Jon, when you Googled these ingredients, you would find out ammonium nitrate is a common
3669520	3673160	agricultural fertilizer and a deadly explosive agent.
3673160	3674160	Yeah.
3674560	3680320	It was used to blow up the World Trade Center the first time, I think, or was that the Oklahoma
3680320	3681320	City bombing?
3681320	3683080	Hey, Clark, why do you know so much about it?
3683080	3684080	I am Keith.
3684080	3685080	That's Keith.
3685080	3686360	I don't know anything about it.
3686360	3687360	I'm a cop.
3687360	3689600	I learned this in cop school.
3689600	3691560	It's the one thing you remember.
3691560	3693720	Making bombs was the only thing that interested you.
3693720	3694720	Which one was it?
3694720	3695720	Timothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City.
3695720	3696720	Yep, that piece of shit.
3696720	3698680	Do you guys know a brand name called The Works?
3698680	3700960	Yeah, it's used to clean your toilets.
3700960	3708160	Also if you put The Works and balls of aluminum foil in a water bottle and shake it up, you
3708160	3710000	can make a Works bomb.
3710000	3711920	It's not really a bomb as much as it is.
3711920	3713680	It just explodes and makes a really loud sound.
3713680	3716840	It'll make the grass not grow in that spot for a couple years.
3716840	3720400	Because it's full of chemicals, but yeah, the chemicals in The Works that clean your
3720400	3727280	toilet, also break the aluminum foil down into gas and then it explodes the bottle.
3727280	3729440	If you put it in a two liter, it's even louder.
3729440	3734560	I know this from lots of experience in Ozark, Missouri, where you do it and then you're
3734560	3736080	like, oh, we got to get out of here.
3736080	3739880	And then people call the cops and you're like, you've wasted resources.
3739880	3742720	My dad showed us how to do that in our backyard.
3742720	3744240	It's very fun.
3744240	3748000	If I wasn't a little drunk right now, I would suggest making one.
3748000	3752840	Hey, listeners at home, get a two liter bottle.
3752840	3755480	By this point in the podcast, we're all three beers deep.
3755480	3761600	Okay, so as you guys are talking about what kind of bombs you can make with these materials.
3761600	3764280	Honestly, yeah, I think it's in character.
3764280	3768000	John Lee Pettymore would know right away that you can make bombs.
3768000	3773480	He and Keith might even be bonding over this for the first time.
3773480	3781360	And as you're bonding, Randy Angst comes caning back into the room holding his underwear aloft.
3781360	3784840	Hey, Randy, could you not find a trash can, buddy?
3784840	3788600	I can pull my sidearm at name and I'm like, why would you bring that in here?
3788600	3789600	Go throw it away.
3789600	3790600	Oh, no.
3790600	3791600	And he looks really sad.
3791600	3792600	God damn it.
3792600	3805560	He looks so sad and then he says, it's not my fault and walks back out of view.
3805560	3806560	Well, that's fine.
3806560	3810040	Hey, Randy, I shout down the hallway, bad news, buddy, you can't take this oil painting
3810040	3811040	either.
3811040	3812040	Damn it.
3812040	3813360	What's the coolest gun here?
3813880	3817440	Oh, they're all pretty equal except for the sniper rifle, which should go to Clark because
3817440	3818440	he has the highest firearms.
3818440	3821480	No, but I mean, just like to make up for him, you know, doing what he did.
3821480	3822480	Oh, well, the sniper rifle.
3822480	3823480	Yeah.
3823480	3830920	I take the sniper rifle, I kick the door to the bathroom open and I hand it over to Randy
3830920	3833480	and say, here, let's go shoot this.
3833480	3842320	Randy is Winnie the Pooh-ing in the bathroom, AKA he's just wearing a shirt and his vest
3842320	3847880	and his jacket and he's wearing no underwear and no pants, but his socks are showing and
3847880	3851760	he just yells at you, what are you doing?
3851760	3855480	No, I, I spent some time in the hospital recently in a gown.
3855480	3856840	Don't be, don't be embarrassed.
3856840	3864020	I've, you know, he starts peeing all over the floor and he's like, oh, actually thank
3864020	3865020	you.
3865020	3869120	I can use it to shoot this pee for solid piss I've had in months.
3869120	3872040	Oh, hey, pee is not supposed to be solid.
3872760	3877700	Okay, well, uh, as soon as you get yourself cleaned up, come shoot this sniper rifle so
3877700	3878700	we can leave.
3878700	3882160	You just throw it at his feet and you're like, clean yourself up.
3882160	3885240	Okay, sounds good.
3885240	3887280	And Clark is still looking through this room.
3887280	3890980	Uh, I want to see if there's anything that isn't immediately evident.
3890980	3891980	Search rolls.
3891980	3892980	Yeah.
3892980	3893980	You can roll search.
3893980	3894980	10.
3894980	3895980	Nice.
3895980	3897880	59 on a die don't pass.
3897880	3899280	Ooh, I crit failed.
3899280	3900280	Okay, nice.
3900280	3901280	99.
3901520	3908880	Okay, so here I am about to open a trap door, stumble into me and break off the handle forever.
3908880	3911120	You stumble into him and break his nose.
3911120	3917100	Okay, so Keith, you come walking back into the living room, Clark and John began searching
3917100	3918100	over the house.
3918100	3924220	John, you were in the kitchen and you actually see there's a faulty square of tiles in the
3924220	3925380	kitchen floor.
3925380	3926420	What kind of tile?
3926420	3929600	They're like eight inch by eight inch and four of them are loose.
3929600	3931640	I go lift up one of the loose tiles.
3931640	3938040	Okay, so as you peel away these tiles, you would see that there is an empty cubicle space
3938040	3944760	right beneath you that seems to be about a foot by a foot and it looks like something
3944760	3949360	heavy was dragged on the tile from this spot toward the front door.
3949360	3952280	Okay, I snap a picture of that and tell everybody about what I just found.
3952280	3958260	Okay, so you're hollering about that as Clark is standing in the foyer and he's looking
3958260	3962420	at the suit of armor, which has this white hard hat on it.
3962420	3964860	I tap on it, knock on it.
3964860	3966260	That's exactly correct.
3966260	3970340	As soon as you knock on it, I need you to roll dexterity.
3970340	3973600	Oh, holy shit.
3973600	3976780	Some dark soul shit hasn't happened.
3976780	3979380	I pass with a six on a 60.
3979380	3985780	The floor drops out from underneath you and you grab onto the edge of a trap door that
3985780	3993580	leads to a pit beneath you and as you're holding on, you look down into the pit and you see
3993580	3995600	two dead bodies.
3995600	3997900	The smell is overwhelming.
3997900	4005660	I need you to roll sanity in order to keep holding on.
4005660	4007540	I do not pass.
4007540	4010740	Okay, you're going to lose one sanity.
4010740	4011740	I am at 29.
4011740	4013340	And now it's just me and you, Jon.
4013380	4019580	Yeah, sorry listeners that the most capable part of this team is about to die in a pit,
4019580	4023340	but blame Zach.
4023340	4028300	You fall down, however, you kind of brace yourself against the walls on either side
4028300	4032420	of you as you go down and you just barely come down a little awkward.
4032420	4038300	You lose one hit point, but you're now 12 feet down in a pit with two dead bodies.
4038300	4043340	One is male, one is female, but they're basically indistinguishable outside of that.
4043340	4044660	Do they have clothes on?
4044660	4045660	Yes.
4045660	4050820	I'm going to holler up, boys, I'm falling.
4050820	4052580	Well I hear all of this like happening.
4052580	4057980	I don't see it, but I run over and I see the hole in the ground and look down and I see
4057980	4058980	him.
4058980	4062540	Hey, uh, there's, there's bodies down here.
4062540	4065100	I'm going to, I'm going to go through the pockets.
4065100	4066100	Can you guys start looking at it?
4066100	4067100	Get me out of here.
4067100	4068100	Yeah, dude, I can help you out.
4068100	4069100	I got an idea.
4069100	4070980	This shit smells worse than Randy.
4070980	4074980	Yeah, that's, that actually, that actually factors into my idea.
4074980	4081740	Um, I get Randy's shit pants and hold onto one leg and lower the other one down that
4081740	4082740	hole.
4082740	4088300	Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit
4088300	4094420	next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John, who is lowering down one pant leg of
4094420	4098100	Randy Ang's shit spoiled slacks.
4098100	4104040	Just then a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the
4104040	4106540	house begin shattering.
4106540	4111940	You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon.
4111940	4117500	Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room.
4117500	4123540	The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house.
4147500	4158900	How am I the only one trying to fool?
