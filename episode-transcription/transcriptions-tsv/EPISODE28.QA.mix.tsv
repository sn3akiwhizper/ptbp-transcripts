0	6680	Welcome one and all, it is your only good boy radio DJ Wolf the Dog, and I'm hoping
6680	11640	y'all give me some of them good pets for giving you that good news.
11640	14880	Well it's usually bad news but y'all get it.
14880	21860	Remember to keep those radios tuned to 694.2 PTBP if you want to give Wolf the Dog the
21860	27400	emotional support he needs to keep on going and trudging through the eternal hellscape
27400	29960	that is news and contention.
29960	36000	My producer informs me today that we are celebrating being on air for six months.
36000	41560	That's crazy as hell y'all, I thought it'd only been a few days here in contention time.
41560	46560	But as we all know, time is an illusion my babies.
46560	51640	But what isn't an illusion is my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf.
51640	56680	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener named James W. who emailed us at
56680	59840	pretendingpaw.gmail.com.
59840	64480	Seems they were able to find some audio that is addressed to the police department here
64480	65480	in contention.
65480	71240	Well howdy boys, my name's Jim Hammer.
71240	73760	I'm the mayor of Texas.
73760	79840	I just wanted to say I've been listening to your radio program and I wanted to extend
79840	84920	my help to some boys out there who are doing some good in the world.
85640	89800	If you ever need anything, I could give you a place to hide.
89800	92320	Got an underground bunker system out here.
92320	98760	Ted Cruz is currently hiding in there from some vigilante justice groups, mostly coming
98760	104360	after him for that beard he's growing, but you know, also being the zodiac killer and
104360	105360	whatnot.
105360	107520	But anyways, come on down if you need help.
107520	112160	I could maybe even pardon you for your crimes and such if you need it.
112760	116000	Just remember you got a friend out here in Texas.
116000	117000	Bye!
117000	122320	Thanks Jim Hammer, mayor of Texas, for reaching out.
122320	130720	Hey Jim, no reason, but if your good sweet boy Wolf the dog got himself in some hot water
130720	137480	here in contention, is there any room in that bunker for a little dog like Wolf?
137480	144160	This week we have a special presentation here on 694.2 PTBP, Condensions newest and
144160	147140	only radio station.
147140	154480	We are going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending
154480	156480	to be People.
156480	162240	They have asked me to point out that their show is serialized and there will be spoilers
162240	164120	in this discussion.
164160	169960	So head on back to episode one, when I was but a wee baby my babies.
169960	176520	But first and always, it's kudzu with no backbone.
176520	196680	It's kudzu with no backbone.
196680	205720	It's kudzu with no backbone.
205720	211640	It should be working I think, I'm going to turn this here now.
211640	219320	Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
219320	224040	in no backbone.
224040	227800	In no backbone.
227800	231400	Hello everyone and welcome to Pretending to be People.
231400	237360	I am sitting in this room with Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin.
237360	240200	For the first time all five of us are in the same room.
240200	243560	And today we are releasing a special presentation.
243560	249600	Thank you so much Wolf for having us on your program.
249600	257400	We are here to release a Q&A episode from questions that we've received from listeners.
257400	262960	And the reason that we are doing this, one, obviously to connect with the community.
262960	268920	You guys are growing out there and we really like interacting with all of you.
268920	273040	Very excited about what's in store for the show.
273040	280440	And we are here to release this Q&A episode as a sort of thank you.
280440	283960	Thank you and a kind of launch for our Patreon.
283960	284960	A taste.
284960	289160	Yeah, a taste of what you're going to get on the Patreon, extra content.
289160	292840	But we were kind of blown away by the response we've gotten so far to this podcast.
292840	294280	It's burned my mind, honestly.
294280	296040	So we want to give you guys more.
296040	300360	It's made me just so rock fucking hard.
300360	302420	I can't explain to you guys.
302420	306280	It's really difficult to be around Zach now because of his raging erections.
306280	307880	It's visible at all times.
307880	311080	I like it that way and it's all thanks to all of you.
311080	316280	His wife has tearfully confessed to me that she can't be seen in public with Zach anymore.
316280	321400	His head has visibly grown too.
321400	325480	There's too much blood in the dick and some of it rushes back up to the head.
325480	326920	I've had to get new hats.
326920	328800	It's been an issue.
328800	333320	But with your Patreon subscriptions, you can buy new hats.
333320	334320	Hopefully.
334320	335320	That is the goal.
335320	338480	We are trying to raise money for new hats for my giant fucking head.
338480	343480	Luke, you are the only one who's complained to me in public about people coming up to
343480	345640	you about the podcast.
345640	346640	It's not a complaint.
346640	347640	It just happens.
347640	352400	No, literally somebody talked to us and you were like, it's so annoying when that happens.
352400	353880	I don't think I said so annoying.
353880	355360	It has happened quite a bit.
355360	358840	But I do go out more than the rest of you.
358840	362600	Luke will take pictures with you for sure if you see him out.
362600	363600	For five dollars.
363600	364600	No.
364600	369800	Not only for me, but the rest of the crew if you want them in, we'll put that on the
369800	370800	Patreon.
370800	371800	We'll figure it out.
371800	374420	Yes, we are launching a Patreon.
374420	379480	This is honestly, to be completely frank, it is to keep the show going.
379480	380480	That's true.
380480	386120	I and we spend so much time working on this show to give you guys the quality content
386120	389200	that we think that you deserve.
389200	394280	Real quick, Zach completely makes this podcast what it is.
394280	398880	His editing, his attention to detail, all the work he puts into this makes it the podcast
398880	400580	you love.
400580	405760	So not to get too NPR on you guys, but we need to make it a job for him.
405760	406760	It needs to...
406760	410160	He puts many, many hours into it.
410160	416880	We take a little bit of time out of our days to edit a little bit, but it's mostly Zach
416880	419200	doing this for you and for us.
419200	420440	It's a joy.
420440	424480	And on top of doing all the technical editing stuff, he's running the game and writing the
424480	425480	game.
425480	428740	So he's pulling triple if not quadruple duty.
428740	429740	It's so much fun.
429740	430740	I really enjoy it.
430740	433740	I want to keep doing it.
433740	436720	I want to make this campaign something special.
436720	440820	We've run some really fun campaigns in the past with this group, and I really think that
440820	445680	this one can take the cake and really we can make some memorable moments.
445680	447360	But it takes a lot of time.
447360	448360	It does.
448360	449360	It does.
449360	453600	We would really appreciate you guys supporting us and check it out.
453600	455700	We'll put a link in the episode notes.
455700	457440	I can't believe I just said that.
457440	458440	That's...
458440	459440	All right.
459440	460440	Well...
460440	461440	We're like a real podcast now.
461440	464200	Yeah, I think we're making a podcast now.
464200	465200	All right.
465200	468840	Well, let's get to some questions.
468840	472720	I was certainly blown away by the amount of questions that we received.
472720	475320	And the level of insight in the questions.
475320	476320	Absolutely.
476320	477320	Y'all are smart.
477320	483960	With that being said, let's start with a question from D. Tratara on Instagram.
483960	485960	You know, just some listener I've never met.
485960	487620	No one we know.
487620	489120	He lives in Canada, apparently.
489120	490520	What a weirdo.
490520	491520	Yep.
491520	492520	He asks...
492520	495680	I wouldn't have liked to stand next to him at your wedding.
495680	501280	He asks, what do you think of the notion that technological advancement has rendered selfhood
501280	506760	artificial, therefore making one's identity changeable and plural?
506760	507760	Now, I did...
507760	509480	Can I actually field this one?
509480	510480	Yeah.
510480	511480	Go for it.
511480	512480	Dakota?
512480	513480	Yes.
513480	521840	I asked Dakota to elaborate, and he said, well...
521840	526080	It's evident digital technologies affect both the social and cultural spheres.
526080	531160	As individuals present themselves across different social media platforms, they are able to construct
531160	536800	various versions of themselves, i.e. bringing to the mainstream postmodern ideas, such as
536800	540880	the self being constituted by multiple discourses and structures.
540880	545280	Simultaneously, the technologies that allow for us to enact ourselves in cyberspace also
545280	547880	allow for greater monitoring of our activity.
547880	552640	Thus, the projection of ourselves that we voluntarily put out across these sites can
552640	558340	be aggregated into a quote data double of ourselves, providing those with technological
558340	562900	means to collect such data and a complete picture of who we are.
562900	566260	How many times did you come while you were jacking yourself off there, Dakota?
566260	567260	This...
567260	569260	Hopefully at least once.
569260	574220	Is the question he's asking like, are we the same on the podcast as we are in real life?
574220	575420	Go ahead and answer that one.
575420	577180	I would say, yeah.
577180	579220	We're very bad cops in real life, too.
579220	584380	No, I mean like, our like personalities, like, yeah, I don't think we really tried to change
584380	585500	anything up for it.
585500	587980	Like we just brought what we have to the table and...
588020	590580	Well, you do that voice.
590580	592100	Luke's character voice is pretty intense.
592100	593100	His famous character voice.
593100	595700	Hit us with that Keith Vigna voice.
595700	596700	What's up, everybody?
596700	601580	Oh, man, it's like he's in the room.
601580	602580	Where's Luke?
602580	605060	I'm Keith Vigna now.
605060	606340	Follow up question.
606340	608700	Will you ever do a character voice?
608700	611020	If I get a new character?
611020	613660	I think that's coming pretty soon.
614300	618540	And it'll sound like this.
618540	619540	I'm working on it.
619540	621740	Yeah, I think that's a good starting point.
621740	624580	Dakota also asked, what do we...
624580	625580	We've got an...
625580	631140	It seemed like, yeah, while I was in it at a point, it seemed like a good time to burp.
631140	632140	Absolutely.
632140	636700	We've got another question from fucks up invoker combos.
636700	637700	What does that mean?
637700	640900	It's gotta be a video game thing, but I don't think I play those kind of video games.
640900	645180	All right, well, he would love to know, or she would love to know, they would love to
645180	649380	know how Zach prepares for scenario campaign and session.
649380	650620	Luke, do you want to take this one?
650620	652260	Yeah, I'll take this one.
652260	653260	He doesn't basically.
653260	654260	No, no.
654260	656300	How does he approach making a new story?
656300	657740	How far ahead does he plan?
657740	659840	How much is fleshed out before they start playing?
659840	664100	How much does he prepare between sessions and how much is improvisation?
664100	667700	So I'll start it out.
667700	671100	The answer to this question is, dude, I really have no idea.
671100	672620	All I know is that he does a lot.
672620	674220	So I'll hand it over to...
674220	675220	We should ask Zach about this.
675220	676220	Zach would know about this.
676220	677220	Oh, wait, real quick, Joe.
677220	678220	Joe, what do you think?
678220	679220	What do you think?
679220	683140	It's pretty obvious that Zach would be the one to answer this.
683140	685880	I agree.
685880	688020	Isn't this podcast about subverting expectations?
688020	692220	Hey, Justin, do you want to hop in on here real quick and what do you think?
692220	696260	Zach Facebook messaged me and he says he spends very little time on this.
696260	699260	He just wants that Patreon money for him.
699260	702260	Okay, to actually answer the question.
702260	709580	This is kind of a big question, I would say, but I will tell you that before we started
709580	710580	recording...
710580	711580	You're a big boy.
711580	716420	I am a big boy with big answers for big questions and my name's Zach.
716420	717420	Big butch boy.
717420	720140	Are you ready for this big butch boy to answer your big butch questions?
720140	721140	I want to hear it.
721140	722140	Okay.
722140	723140	Oh, God.
723140	725140	I'm working on my new character voice.
726020	727860	I love that new character voice.
727860	732920	After our last campaign finished up, I knew I had at least two months to start writing
732920	737800	something new and we had realized at the end of playing our last campaign that we wanted
737800	741900	to record our next one for posterity's purposes.
741900	749980	I began writing and I took inspiration from a lot of different things, but I knew that
749980	753420	what we know is small town life.
753420	757420	I feel like we consume a lot of content from that setting.
757420	758420	We've watched Smallville.
758420	759420	Exactly.
759420	760420	We know.
760420	762380	I'm from Ozark, Missouri.
762380	767860	That's number two, is that we live in Missouri and I wanted to play a campaign in that setting.
767860	768860	We'd never done that before.
768860	773620	Delta Green is mostly a game where you're dealing in government agencies and really
773620	782740	highfalutin stuff that is very redacted and you have to have a high clearance to get that
782740	783740	information.
783740	785460	I wanted to play with small town cops.
785460	789340	I thought that would be really fun and it turns out-
789340	791340	It was.
791340	794380	With that being said, I began to build a plot.
794380	800220	I knew that I wanted to mix in rules from Pulp Cthulhu with this campaign because I
800220	804220	read the source book and it fucking blew me away.
804220	809780	I was so into it from the very beginning, actually two years ago or maybe a year ago
809780	816260	when it first came out, I, for my birthday, ran one of the scenarios from the back of
816260	821940	the Pulp Cthulhu book and it was a shit show.
821940	826620	Thomas and Justin were both there and we just drank too much.
826620	832220	It was a birthday celebration but I think Justin and Thomas' characters ran off-
832220	834100	To meet Ernest Timmingway.
834100	835100	Because he owed-
835100	836100	Oh, is it that one?
836100	837100	Yeah.
837100	838100	Oh, that was a good time.
838100	839100	It was a good time.
839420	840420	People were very upset.
840420	841420	The hotel?
841420	842420	I was too drunk to realize how-
842420	843420	Yeah, I was there.
843420	845940	Me and Zach, or me and Thomas got-
845940	846940	You and I had a really great time.
846940	849100	We got very upset.
849100	853660	We wanted the story to go a certain way that no one else maybe did in the room.
853660	855320	We were just like, wait, why are we here?
855320	859700	Of course it's to fuck around for 15 minutes each turn while we're really drunk.
859700	864100	Okay, so that's how good Zach is at this shit.
864100	867680	When you're really drunk, we kind of forgot that it was a DM situation.
867680	869720	We were just being these assholes.
869720	874480	It was an extremely fun game, but I fell in love with Pulp Cthulhu right then and there
874480	880560	from having all the different talents and the sanity losing skills that would arrive
880560	883000	with sanity loss was really cool.
883000	884800	I wanted to throw those in.
884800	888800	I started writing this campaign with the items.
888800	889800	That's interesting.
889800	895920	I really liked the rules for the different magical items, but I wanted to put it in a
895920	898400	more delta green setting.
898400	904600	I started with the items that were in the trunk and I built the story out from there.
904600	910960	There are about 35 characters that live in contention and in the city.
910960	915120	They are all independent of each other with their own motives.
915120	921960	I changed their wants and needs and motives based on everything that happens with these
921960	924160	three police officers.
924160	928440	Basically I have a doc sheet where I have all the different characters listed and then
928440	935520	I change how the actions of these boys affect them week to week to decide how the story
935520	937440	should progress the next week.
937440	942240	As you've seen, I have what I learned from good friends of Jackson Elias.
942240	944200	They call them bangs, I think.
944200	949540	Somebody calls them bangs, which are basically just things that you throw in into a scenario
949540	953600	and you force your players to deal with them.
953600	958920	So I've basically wrote out all these different characters and what they're going through
958920	961680	and then I write bangs each week.
961680	964400	What's an example of a bang that's happened so far in the story?
964400	968480	So far in the story, obviously spoilers in this episode.
968480	972200	If you haven't listened to any of the podcasts up to this point, then...
972200	973200	Stop listening.
973200	974360	Yeah, go back to episode one.
974360	976160	This is a chronological show.
976160	978720	Should we record a little tag saying that right for the start?
978720	980200	I'll have Wolf the Dog do it.
980200	981200	Nice.
981200	982200	Yes.
982800	983800	No.
986800	989000	I'll make Justin do it.
989000	990000	Oh shit.
990000	992760	Wolf's gone Hollywood.
992760	995400	I think we still keep him in the basement, so...
995400	996400	So spoilers.
996400	997400	Right.
997400	998400	Where were we?
998400	999400	You can't let him see the full moon.
999400	1000400	An example of a bang.
1000400	1004360	An example of a bang is the body of John Peters falling onto your car.
1004360	1005360	Oh yeah.
1005360	1007520	So that was going to happen no matter what we do.
1007520	1008520	Yeah.
1008520	1009520	Yeah.
1009840	1015360	It's like in storytelling it's like, would it be more realistic in this super unrealistic
1015360	1019480	setting for that body to fall not on one of your cars?
1019480	1023480	Probably, but it's a game and it's a story and it's way cooler if it falls on your fucking
1023480	1024480	car.
1024480	1026280	Oh, and that's not something I've ever even questioned as a player.
1026280	1027280	Sure, yeah.
1027280	1028280	Totally.
1028280	1030920	So that is basically how I prepare.
1030920	1036760	The scenario has seeds that I wrote two years ago, before the campaign started, probably
1036760	1037760	two years ago.
1038240	1039240	When do you think?
1039240	1040240	What month of...
1040240	1043200	Okay, so we started recording in December of 2017.
1043200	1044200	2017.
1044200	1045200	Oh my god.
1045200	1046200	Yeah, right?
1046200	1047200	Yeah.
1047200	1048200	Okay.
1048200	1049200	It's been a while.
1049200	1053840	So we started, yeah, recording in December of 2017, so I probably started writing this
1053840	1059440	in October of 2017 and some of the things that I've written have not come up yet in
1059440	1060440	the show.
1060440	1061440	Wow.
1061440	1063440	Well, I'd hope so.
1063440	1065480	So I have a lot planned.
1065480	1071160	I have a lot of moving parts that I deal with and that is how much is fleshed out before
1071160	1072300	they start playing.
1072300	1078040	So for each session I try to brush up on what the people around them in their area might
1078040	1081680	be doing and then if they try to go somewhere that I'm not ready for, I throw a fucking
1081680	1083680	dead body on their car.
1083680	1085160	Yeah, you...
1085160	1087240	Oh, did you guys want to go to the mill?
1087240	1088240	Really kept us away from that mill.
1088240	1090640	Oh, did you want to go to the mill?
1090640	1092440	Kept going to the mill and then it came up.
1092440	1097040	You can abandon any responsibilities at any point in time and go anywhere, but I tried
1097040	1100160	to make the responsibilities pretty top priority.
1100160	1106040	That is what I've realized now that it's just like, if he does that, just go to the mill.
1106040	1107040	Just go to the mill.
1107040	1108640	Oh, oh, Chief Maggie's house is on fire.
1108640	1109640	She's burning alive.
1109640	1112720	Brian, care, we're going to the mill.
1112720	1117600	One thing I, it's not really, it kind of has to do with the question, but like as far as
1117600	1123760	like preparing for stuff, me and Joe and Thomas, you know, when we would be recording an episode,
1123760	1129640	like we would go back through and like see what we'd done prior to recording that episode.
1129640	1134880	So before we record, Zach usually writes up a little, uh, overview of what we did last
1134880	1139840	time and that he has us be sure to read that before we start recording for the next session.
1139840	1141480	That helps keep it all fresh in our mind.
1141480	1147240	I sent an overview to everyone of everything that happened and I sent individual overviews
1147240	1150120	for times when they were the only one in the room.
1150120	1154200	And usually we would read those as soon as we got to your house and then we would record
1154200	1159080	the next session and Joe, Joe would read them three times.
1159080	1164160	This also brings up something that is kind of one of the reasons I thought we should
1164160	1165840	have an episode like this.
1165840	1169760	We recorded this, like he said, we started in December, 2017.
1169760	1176700	The episode you just heard was recorded in November or December, 2018.
1176700	1181400	We did this all over the course of the year, so if there's ever any time where we don't
1181400	1185860	know what's going on in the podcast, like you're like screaming at your microphone or
1185860	1186860	not your mic.
1186860	1188220	Oh, you're just making excuses now.
1188220	1189220	Oh, okay, cool.
1189220	1194500	Uh, so I thought this whole Q and a would just to be about excuses.
1194500	1198420	Here's why we're so sorry.
1198420	1204100	There would be a significant time gaps between recording Thomas moved away for like three
1204100	1206700	months after recording the first sessions.
1206700	1208900	I was just gone for a while.
1208900	1212720	If there's ever anything super frustrating that you hear that's like, why the fuck don't
1212720	1216240	they know that it's probably just because they're stupid or why are they making that
1216240	1219780	super outdated cultural reference?
1219780	1223960	That was a personal, like I was listening to episode like we, we do some editing on
1223960	1227140	our own tracks and I was listening to myself once and I was like, well, that's a fucking
1227140	1228920	meme from like October.
1228920	1229920	Like that's bullshit.
1229920	1230920	Stale.
1230920	1231920	Stale.
1232700	1237200	And the last episode, I think we mentioned like, yeah, it's a kid from mid nineties and
1237200	1238200	I'm like, that happened a little while ago.
1238200	1239200	That was a while ago.
1239200	1240200	Yeah.
1240200	1241200	I still haven't seen mid nineties.
1241200	1242200	It's fine.
1242200	1243200	It's a, it's a.
1243200	1244960	Oh wait, no, the one I really need to see is eighth grade.
1244960	1245960	Yes.
1245960	1246960	And I haven't seen that one either.
1246960	1251800	It was May 7th, 2019 right now when we're recording this and we haven't seen eighth
1251800	1252800	grade.
1252800	1253800	Yeah.
1253800	1254800	I have seen both of those.
1254800	1255800	I'm sorry listeners.
1255800	1257000	But anyway, let's go to another question.
1257000	1262000	Which rules are they using from pulp and which are native to Delta green?
1262000	1263000	I'll field this one.
1263000	1269400	We are playing Delta green mechanics except for we have abandoned the bonds mechanic and
1269400	1273680	we have picked up the luck rules from pulp Cthulhu.
1273680	1281240	We are planning, Ooh, spoiler, spoiler alert for the next episode.
1281240	1285880	We are going to add in some talents from pulp Cthulhu.
1285880	1287320	Oh, very cool.
1287320	1289240	I'm very excited about this.
1289240	1291240	That's exclusive to us too, listeners.
1291240	1292240	Let's move on.
1292240	1295840	We've got a question from crush 36 real quick.
1295840	1296840	Shout out to crush 36.
1296840	1297840	Awesome.
1297840	1298840	Awesome fan.
1298840	1299840	Best fan.
1299840	1300840	Thank you so much.
1300840	1307120	Crush 36 created a subreddit for pretending to be people and it has freaked me out in
1307120	1308880	a very good way.
1308880	1312920	I once said when we first started recording, I think maybe the very first episode we were
1312920	1318760	talking about goals of this podcast and we thought, I think that we would make it maybe
1318760	1321880	10 episodes in probably before we stopped.
1321880	1327560	However, that didn't happen and someone made fan art and it was, I was about to say, we
1327560	1329120	had our first fan art.
1329120	1333640	Crush did a sketch of Clark and boy was that cool to see.
1333640	1335400	It was, it was pretty awesome.
1335400	1336400	That was really awesome.
1336400	1338640	Like a Mr Leahy meets Dale Gribble.
1338640	1339640	Yeah, it was good.
1339640	1340640	Oh my God.
1340640	1341640	Yeah.
1341680	1343680	Very, very similar to what I had pictured for sure.
1343680	1344680	Oh wow.
1344680	1345680	Yeah.
1345680	1346680	Very similar.
1346680	1347680	I pictured him a little fatter.
1347680	1348680	That was the only difference.
1348680	1350800	I pictured him a little younger, but I really liked the image I saw.
1350800	1352120	I was like, Oh shit.
1352120	1353760	He got, he got the balding thing.
1353760	1354760	Perfect.
1354760	1355760	That's exactly what I was picturing.
1355760	1356760	As far as that goes.
1356760	1361160	Taylor said that she pictured Clark Bishop with hair, but I guess she did role play with
1361160	1364600	a, uh, a younger, a younger Clark Bishop who probably had hair.
1364600	1369480	Well, also I just pictured Clark Bishop as Kenneth from 30 Rock as Jack McRae.
1369480	1371480	No, that's Drew.
1371480	1372480	That's Drew.
1372480	1373480	That's Drew.
1373480	1374480	That's Drew.
1374480	1375480	Fat.
1375480	1376480	What's his name?
1376480	1377480	Shit.
1377480	1378480	Jack McBrayer.
1378480	1379480	Yeah.
1379480	1380480	Well, okay.
1380480	1382480	So if, if, if Andy Richter had Jack McBrayer's personality, that's what I'm thinking of.
1382480	1383480	Yeah.
1383480	1384480	That is incredible.
1384480	1385480	Yeah.
1385480	1387520	It was when I, when I saw that on the subreddit, I was like, dope.
1387520	1388840	We have fan art now.
1388840	1389840	Like that's, that's fucking wild.
1389840	1396840	It blew me away and made all of the time and effort that I put into this really feel like
1396840	1397840	it's heartwarming.
1397840	1398840	It was extremely heartwarming.
1399840	1400840	Yeah.
1400840	1402840	Shout out to crush 36.
1402840	1403840	Sorry.
1403840	1408760	Crush 36 asks how far from the original storyline and vision have the boys wandered?
1408760	1413840	Did major plot points have to get sacrificed to the altar of improv?
1413840	1415640	Yes.
1415640	1416640	A lot.
1416640	1419960	Um, next one.
1419960	1421160	Thanks for the question.
1421160	1422160	The answer is a lot.
1422160	1423160	Uh, no, for real.
1423160	1424160	Yeah.
1424160	1428000	Is there anything you can tell us about that without being too spoiler?
1428160	1432400	Because I mean, obviously as players, that's something I really want to know.
1432400	1433400	Okay.
1433400	1435480	Here is the truth.
1435480	1442800	We got together for a session zero two months after I had began writing this entire campaign
1442800	1446680	and we got together, we had already been talking about characters and we'd already been talking
1446680	1451360	about setting, but we were going to meet and record on mic, which I think we have recorded
1451360	1456360	still us talking about what the characters were going to be, what the setting was going
1456360	1457360	to be.
1457720	1458720	We built the town.
1458720	1459720	We built the town.
1459720	1463800	I had a list of different kinds of businesses that would exist in a small town and we went
1463800	1471160	through and I came up with a long time just town building, like just world building, world
1471160	1472160	building.
1472160	1473160	Yeah.
1473160	1474160	Which is God so much fun.
1474160	1475160	Was that okay.
1475160	1476400	Uh, Oh God.
1476400	1480000	This would be a more informed question if I could remember the name of the system.
1480000	1485480	But do you know that, uh, that sci-fi RPG where everybody builds the world together.
1485480	1486560	That's like the original one, right?
1486560	1487560	The old school one.
1487560	1491120	You can die during this is a pretty light one where everybody kind of roll some things
1491120	1493360	and all the players help build the system.
1493360	1495440	I was wondering if it was inspired by that at all.
1495440	1496440	It super wasn't.
1496440	1503240	Uh, I've just been, I've just been listening to a lot of different people talking about
1503240	1504240	playing RPGs.
1504240	1510480	I've been listening to a lot of different actual plays and I really took from them the
1510480	1514920	idea of coming together for a session zero and world building.
1514920	1519400	You also mentioned at the time that it would help us to have a familiarity with the area
1519400	1520400	kind of built in.
1520400	1525720	And it is awesome cause right now I'm looking at the map of contention hung up on the wall
1525720	1527040	in the room that we're recording in.
1527040	1531480	We've posted a few times on social media, the map of contention, but we did have one
1531480	1532480	drawn out.
1532480	1534320	Uh, it's, it's huge.
1534320	1539040	The map that Zach made and he would point to where things were going on for us in the
1539040	1540040	episode.
1540040	1541040	Yeah.
1541040	1542700	Cause the map was really important to me from the beginning.
1542700	1546900	If you're playing in a small town, I thought it'd be really fun to see where everything
1546900	1547900	is.
1547900	1548900	Pages, clinkers.
1548900	1549900	Yeah.
1549900	1550900	All these different places.
1550900	1557980	And uh, thankfully we have Justin who plays Wolf the dog and does the soundtrack for pretending
1557980	1560540	to be people real quick.
1560540	1562100	Give it up for Justin.
1562100	1567580	You guys are too sweet.
1567580	1572260	Somebody did ask the question, Oh, Brendan DePinto on Facebook asked, how long did it
1572260	1574020	take to create the map?
1574020	1578740	And so, I mean, I made the original sketch of the map, but recently a couple of weeks
1578740	1584740	ago for those listening, but like two days ago for us, we posted the map of contention
1584740	1586460	that Justin made.
1586460	1592020	So basically I had Zach just send me a high res copy of the map, like taking a picture
1592020	1593380	of it.
1593380	1599780	And then I taught myself Adobe illustrator so I could make said map as a high resolution
1599780	1604520	as possible because I really like whenever he would post stuff and he'd be like, this
1604520	1607140	is where this episode is taking place.
1607140	1612160	But I also wanted it to be like higher quality and a little more character added into it.
1612160	1617380	So it took me like six hours or so to make it something like that cause I was also trying
1617380	1618620	to learn a program.
1618620	1620580	The splashylvania logo.
1620580	1622260	It's the best thing on there.
1622260	1623260	So fucking cool.
1623260	1629320	If you haven't looked at it yet, zoom in on that because basically I took the like water,
1629320	1634360	the wave aesthetic and like added that in and then just added these big, huge vampire
1634360	1635960	chompers on top of it.
1635960	1636960	It's incredible.
1636960	1637960	It gets me going.
1637960	1644720	And it was really fun to create little icons for all of these weird places and contention,
1644720	1648320	kind of like a video game map almost is what I was thinking.
1648320	1649720	And that's, that's exactly what it is.
1649720	1650720	And it's like perfect.
1650720	1653560	I think about this like a video game.
1653560	1658400	I mean that's, I mean all video games essentially come out of the tabletop, like early RPGs.
1658400	1664240	So right back to the major plot points that have gotten sacrificed.
1664240	1670200	In that session zero, we were talking about the map and I was telling you guys about the
1670200	1674400	piston junkyard because I knew that was going to be a place that we were going to go to
1674400	1676160	pretty much right away.
1676160	1682200	Speaking of bangs, very first bang in the whole show is a call from Julie Maxwell says
1682200	1684680	there's a dead body in the piston junkyard.
1684680	1685680	That's a bang.
1685680	1686680	Boom.
1686680	1688000	And so the story begins.
1688000	1693140	During that session zero, I said, yeah, and there's a junkyard right here and it sits
1693140	1696080	on an old mine.
1696080	1703920	And Thomas said, Oh, is the super dark evil at the bottom of the old mine?
1703920	1708120	And I said, no, I have to write that.
1708120	1711920	It would have made things a lot easier for us if I had just shut up.
1711920	1716880	So then I rewrote the entire campaign idea.
1716880	1719200	I had not even thought about that.
1719200	1725280	Because the evil was at the bottom of the mine, but now it's not.
1725280	1726280	And I like that.
1726280	1733360	So good job, Thomas, for punching up the whole campaign during session zero.
1733360	1739760	So stuff like that, obviously, but once we got into the show, like I said before, I have
1739760	1741200	all these different moving parts.
1741200	1746480	So they basically interact with a fully working town in my mind.
1746480	1751080	So that was a kind of improv out of the campaign.
1751080	1753760	Has anything that major happened in the campaign?
1753760	1754760	Well, yeah.
1754760	1759680	I mean, we have to mention Keith's pants every once in a while, just to remind people how
1759680	1760680	big they are.
1760680	1761680	But I'm saying it's no.
1761680	1764320	That's plot points that we came up with organically, but like, have you...
1764320	1768280	Not even a plot point, that's just a bit.
1768280	1772000	But nothing you've planned has been super changed by our actions?
1772960	1778320	Every single thing that you do changes where the story goes, because I don't have a story
1778320	1779320	in mind.
1779320	1783320	I only have people and people who want things.
1783320	1785820	And so the story isn't already written.
1785820	1788820	You guys are the ones basically making that happen.
1788820	1789820	So cool.
1789820	1795480	I will say the most affected is every little thing that you mentioned about your characters.
1795480	1799960	Every little detail goes into my little book about your backstories, which you've given
1799960	1804680	me basically full realm to just go haywire on.
1804680	1807680	It's kind of like the real book you keep on all of us as friends.
1807680	1808680	Exactly.
1808680	1811440	Which I heard that you found.
1811440	1813400	And Thomas told me all about it.
1813400	1814400	I was flattered.
1814400	1815400	Thank you so much.
1815400	1817400	I liked what I read in there.
1817400	1818400	Okay.
1818400	1819400	Well.
1819400	1821840	You were so complimentary of all of our feet.
1821840	1826080	That's why I don't take my shoes off at Zach's house.
1829960	1834960	I just don't think about him that much myself, but I'm so glad you've noticed.
1834960	1837720	He likes the smell.
1837720	1839680	You guys were just born with great feet.
1839680	1840680	What can I say?
1840680	1841680	Thanks.
1841680	1842680	You too.
1842680	1845820	I am going to need a heat break and a pee break if that's okay.
1845820	1847320	Let's go ahead and take a break.
1847320	1852360	We will be right back after this word from our sponsors.
1852360	1853680	This is Al from Al's Tires.
1853680	1856160	I don't want to waste too much of your time.
1856160	1859180	We have good tires and good service at good prices.
1859180	1861960	Come on down and see us if you feel that's appropriate.
1861960	1863320	Thank you.
1863320	1867180	Here at Burgatory, we put three simple things into every meal we serve.
1867180	1872300	Quality ingredients, service with a smile, and unquestioning faith in our undying Lord,
1872300	1873620	Jesus Christ.
1873620	1877160	We cook our patties the old fashioned way, medium or above.
1877160	1879740	It's all undefined gray area here at Burgatory.
1879740	1882420	Time is running out to indulge in our monthly specials for May.
1882420	1887280	We're celebrating Cinco de Mayo with our seven layer dip and the Holy Guacamole burger.
1887280	1893560	Don't forget to tell your amigos, Burgatory, come spend some time with us.
1893560	1895600	Al from Al's Tires here again.
1895600	1899400	Just wanted to let you know we're located just outside of contention on rural route
1899400	1900400	six.
1900400	1903180	If you pass the tiger sanctuary, you've gone too far.
1903180	1906840	Come on down and see us if it's not too much out of your way.
1906840	1908480	Thank you.
1908480	1909480	All right.
1909480	1915200	And make sure to get the product that was featured in that last advertisement.
1915200	1916640	I love that product.
1916640	1917840	I use it all the time.
1917840	1919080	It's an extremely good product.
1919080	1920080	I'm using it.
1920080	1924160	I'm either wearing it or using it right now.
1924160	1925740	Product make me happy boy.
1925740	1928540	That product makes me extremely happy.
1928540	1930360	I don't buy product.
1930360	1934600	We got a question from the Robert Shippey on Instagram.
1934600	1939040	He asks, Luke, why?
1939040	1941600	Because it's fun.
1941600	1942600	I love it.
1943600	1946600	If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be doing this.
1946600	1950600	Luke, you know other people exist, right?
1950600	1951600	Yeah.
1951600	1959000	I try not to do anything that is too detrimental to anyone else's fun.
1959000	1961000	You never do anything detrimental to our fun.
1961000	1966200	I'm playing a game to have fun and I'm going to do it for fun.
1966200	1969280	It's only added joy to the group dynamic.
1969280	1971720	I'm not playing a Dr. Denny Dennison.
1971720	1974160	That guy was much more disruptive to the group.
1974160	1975880	He was.
1975880	1982840	Luke's last character was named Dr. Denny Dennison, AKA Worm Fingers.
1982840	1987800	I hated pretty much everything about him.
1987800	1990640	I was a doctor for a cult.
1990640	1998600	I had a scat fetish that was developed through the game.
1998600	2001440	I didn't plan it that way, but it happened.
2002160	2003160	You really ran with it.
2003160	2005160	Overall, just really creepy, terrible character.
2005160	2011880	I actually specifically remember the first time that you acted out your scat fetish.
2011880	2018680	You actually stood up in my kitchen in the dining room and you stood up and fully charade
2018680	2026920	played out your interaction with a toilet and then I think perhaps masturbating to completion.
2026920	2030880	And then he shat on your cat.
2030880	2034520	All that's true until the cat thing.
2034520	2037360	He was a doctor for a cult and that's all you need to know.
2037360	2039160	So obviously that comes with the territory.
2039160	2049600	So yeah, Keith Vigna is a pretty tame character for most of the characters I've played.
2049600	2051760	Keith is pretty tame.
2051760	2056880	I like playing a character that is not all there.
2056880	2058640	I think you're doing it very well.
2058640	2064760	I remember specifically when we were coming up with character ideas, you had this giddy
2064760	2070040	fucking look on your face and you came up to me and you're like, I'm playing an idiot.
2070040	2073280	And I was like, all right, well, which is easy for me to do.
2073280	2079800	If the losers don't know, Luke is literally right now, he's saving up for a system of
2079800	2080800	a down tattoo.
2080800	2082800	That's not a joke.
2082800	2084120	Yeah, that is completely true.
2084120	2086520	He was also his high school valedictorian.
2086520	2087520	I was.
2088400	2091360	He went to school with a bunch of dumb asses.
2091360	2092360	That's not true.
2092360	2095880	I graduated a class of like 453 I think.
2095880	2097560	I thought you were going to say like four or five.
2097560	2099840	453, top of my class.
2099840	2102960	Like you didn't know whether there were four or five people in your graduating class.
2102960	2107560	I'm book smart, not smart.
2107560	2111160	That's not what you are.
2111160	2115720	We've got another question here from, I don't know how to say this, maybe oomph.
2115720	2116720	I like oomph.
2116720	2124040	OMF dash on Reddit asks, did Zach offer up insane options selling coke, killing your
2124040	2127520	brother, thinking the guys wouldn't do it?
2127520	2131280	I love the fact that the guys are kept in the dark on these solo side missions.
2131280	2132280	Second question.
2132280	2133400	Oh no, sorry.
2133400	2134400	Not second question.
2134400	2137920	I love the fact that these guys are kept in the dark on these solo missions.
2137920	2138920	It started over.
2138920	2139920	I already did.
2139920	2140920	Yeah, he had it.
2140920	2143440	That's the whole thing over again.
2143440	2148600	Do it.
2148600	2151200	Luke's the producer now.
2151200	2152200	Look at me.
2152200	2153200	I'm the captain now.
2153200	2156080	He's like, I could just tell you didn't get what you needed, so you needed to do it all
2156080	2157080	again.
2157080	2158080	Zach, do it.
2158080	2159080	Do it.
2159080	2160080	Again.
2160080	2161080	Do it.
2161080	2162080	Do it better.
2162080	2163080	But do it, yeah, do it good this time.
2163080	2167280	Do you know that we all demand perfection of ourselves as our characters and you're
2167280	2170480	just here flubbing these fucking pre-written questions?
2170480	2176120	Did Zach offer up insane options, selling coke, killing your brother, thinking the guy...
2176120	2177840	Matt Besser's Bjork.
2177840	2180320	It's Matt Besser's Bjork, sorry.
2180320	2181960	TM TM.
2181960	2188140	So basically, yes, I offered them up thinking that they would make things more interesting,
2188140	2189360	that's for sure.
2189360	2193960	I didn't know that they would perhaps follow through with these things or whether they
2193960	2196920	would help each other do them.
2197480	2204600	Thomas, I certainly expected to at least ask for Keith Vigna's help to sell the cocaine
2204600	2208960	perhaps, but I really didn't know.
2208960	2212040	You misinterpreted our character development.
2212040	2213040	Clearly.
2213040	2214720	I don't really listen to the show.
2214720	2216080	No, why would you?
2216080	2217080	Because I don't think...
2217080	2220560	I like to think that we're all friendly with each other, but I don't think that Keith and
2220560	2222200	Jon are friends, really.
2222200	2223820	Not the best friends, for sure.
2223820	2229860	And also, now that I'm saying it out loud, he's the worst person you could bring in on
2229860	2231580	a drug deal.
2231580	2236960	But on this particular drug deal, he might have been a pretty interesting addition, which
2236960	2239300	is, I guess, why you did that.
2239300	2242740	Clark wouldn't do it, Keith would, but he'd probably fuck something up, so I think it
2242740	2244780	was smart for you to just do it by yourself.
2244780	2248220	I also just wanted five million dollars for my character.
2248220	2249580	To no doubt.
2249580	2250980	And not 2.5.
2250980	2252700	I certainly...
2252700	2253700	That's wrong, right?
2253700	2255060	Well, you brought Drew in, and he's probably...
2255060	2256060	That would be four people.
2256060	2258340	I think Drew was probably the best option to bring in.
2258340	2263180	I mean, you alluded to the fact that it would have been a much different encounter if Keith
2263180	2266780	Vigna would have been there when the Duke came to sell cocaine.
2266780	2267780	That would have been awesome.
2267780	2268780	I should have asked Keith for help.
2268780	2270380	Oh, well, yeah, because that was my brother.
2270380	2272100	Yeah, it turns out.
2272100	2278100	So we can actually get into the question now that someone asked, do the players ever listen
2278100	2282260	back to the podcast, or is that something you don't do to keep yourselves in the dark
2282260	2284260	about the things you don't know?
2284260	2286380	I mean, that's up to you guys to answer.
2286380	2290180	I definitely don't listen to the other guy's stuff, except just recently, Zach gave us
2290180	2295500	permission to hear some of our solo mission stuff, because we were kind of far away from
2295500	2296500	it in playtime.
2296500	2297500	Exactly, yeah.
2297500	2302980	It wasn't going to affect our roleplay at that point, and it was really, really cool.
2302980	2305020	I think we kind of left it up to Zach.
2305020	2309220	We were like, is it okay to listen to this?
2309460	2314820	I think, for the most part, what we had recorded so far, he was like, it's fine.
2314820	2319020	There were certain weeks where I'd say, don't listen to the dreams that other people are
2319020	2322340	having, and then other weeks where I'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2322340	2327940	It came out in-game recently that Jon had done that drug deal, Marvin Glass clearly
2327940	2333060	accused him of it, and you guys immediately bought into the idea at that point.
2333060	2335420	Same with me of killing my brother.
2335420	2339060	I'm pretty sure no one had any clue that Jon was in on that.
2339060	2340540	I think he denied that pretty well.
2340540	2341540	Well, that was the thing.
2341540	2344700	Up until recording this right now-
2344700	2345700	Well, that.
2345700	2348900	I mean, in the last episode, where Jon's just like, no.
2348900	2349900	Yeah.
2349900	2350900	Well, yeah.
2350900	2354660	Up until recording this, we didn't ... Recording anything else up until this right now, we
2354660	2356580	had no clue what each other were doing.
2356580	2357580	During the recording.
2357580	2358580	Right.
2358580	2362180	That's something Zach requested, but it's also, I find it a lot of fun to be in the
2362180	2363180	dark about what you guys are doing.
2363180	2364180	Oh, yeah.
2364180	2365180	It is super fun as a player.
2365180	2366900	It leads to a bunch of really great roleplay moments.
2366900	2371580	That was like ... Now, I do know that Coke Deal and you guys know that-
2371580	2373660	Well, that it was your brother doing the Coke Deal.
2373660	2374660	Right.
2374660	2375660	Yeah, exactly.
2375660	2376660	That was a reveal.
2376660	2377660	We were all excited.
2377660	2378660	Yeah.
2378660	2379660	It surprised us all.
2379660	2380660	That one hit everyone.
2380660	2381660	Yeah.
2381660	2382660	That was cool.
2382660	2383660	It was awesome to know that.
2383660	2387500	I think, Zach, you mentioned in the future, going into it, we're going to do-
2387500	2393100	We got a little lax as we're releasing episodes, but I think it'll be more closed.
2393100	2394100	Yes.
2394300	2399220	As we move on forward, it's going to be just as closed as it was last time in the sense
2399220	2404860	that while we're recording sessions, you guys won't be able to listen to each other's side
2404860	2406380	parts.
2406380	2413300	Within the context of the game, I think everyone's pretty well aware of the deaths of Keith Vigna
2413300	2416380	and Clark Bishop and-
2416380	2417380	With the look-
2417380	2418380	What?
2418380	2419380	What?
2419380	2420380	What?
2420380	2421380	Zach, what?
2421860	2428860	And I mean, to be completely frank, John Lee Pettymore is in the den of Marvin Glasp, so
2428860	2432060	do you think he's going to last super long?
2432060	2433060	We'll see.
2433060	2437660	However, I have made- I basically like all things with this story.
2437660	2444060	I folded in what happens into the future, and so the fact that these guys have listened
2444060	2448900	to certain things, I will make sure that story-wise, it makes sense that their characters know
2448900	2450900	them, if that makes sense.
2450940	2453540	You'll figure it out next week or the week after.
2453540	2458660	The only thing you specifically expressed regret about is that we listen to some of
2458660	2460940	Clark's recent things.
2460940	2461940	Yes.
2461940	2468060	Clark being inducted into the circle of knowledge is something that Thomas and Luke now know,
2468060	2472400	but the characters they're playing do not, so that is one of the things that I am going
2472400	2479340	to attempt to figure out a way to let their characters know while folding that into the
2479340	2480340	plot.
2480380	2483940	If we're getting much closer to when we're actually recording, that'll be a lot easier
2483940	2487620	to manage, it'll just be a matter of you'll be saying don't listen to their section this
2487620	2488620	week.
2488620	2489620	Yep, exactly.
2489620	2496700	Because I mean, we had 27, 28 episodes recorded until just now that we had to get through,
2496700	2499260	so that's weeks of stuff.
2499260	2502900	I hope we're still good at role-playing.
2502900	2504540	I've kind of lost interest in it, honestly.
2504540	2506540	Yeah, it's not my bag anymore.
2506540	2510140	I'm more into Red Dead and Apex right now.
2510140	2511500	Obviously, yeah.
2511500	2512780	Weaving.
2512780	2515140	What hardware and software do you guys use?
2515140	2517620	We actually just upgraded our microphones.
2517620	2519020	Yeah, this very episode.
2519020	2522580	This here very episode you're listening to, we got ourselves some new microphones.
2522580	2525180	Should we say out loud what it is or should we wait for the sponsorship?
2525180	2529180	No, until we know that they don't suck, and until they give us money, we shouldn't.
2529180	2530180	No, let's tell them.
2530180	2532660	So we're super excited about that.
2532660	2538180	Hopefully it'll cut down on the editing time for me and also make the listening experience
2538180	2539180	better for you.
2539180	2541660	Oh, don't do that.
2541660	2548700	To answer the actual question, these are Samsung, not Samsung, Samsung Q2Us.
2548700	2550980	Just for this episode.
2550980	2554380	Yeah, that's not what we recorded on until this point, though.
2554380	2555380	No, previously-
2555380	2557340	So that can be a fun mystery for you.
2557340	2563100	No, I will tell you, previously we were recording on the shittiest SM58 clones.
2563100	2564760	Yeah, they were knock-off.
2564760	2566220	They were trash mics.
2566220	2568660	And that's what I've got right now because I forgot mine in my house.
2568660	2574660	I'm glad you love the audio quality, you fucking peasants.
2574660	2580500	So hopefully we'll be able to take it up another notch in the old quality section.
2580500	2589620	Software-wise, we record into a Tascam Digital Porta Studio 2488 Neo that I have had in my
2589620	2595500	home for four years that belongs to Justin's dad.
2595500	2600020	Yeah, he wants it back sometime, probably.
2600020	2603700	My dad, every six months, will be like, where's my Porta Studio at?
2603700	2605020	What's he doing with it?
2605020	2606500	He's not doing anything with it.
2606500	2609780	He just is like, what if I want to record a whole jazz album by myself?
2609780	2611220	What if I want a podcast?
2611220	2612660	Justin, what's your dad's name?
2612660	2614020	He can come over here and record it.
2614020	2617100	Don't dox Justin, yeah.
2617100	2618100	Justin Jr.?
2618100	2622580	Shout out to Justin Jr. for letting us use his equipment.
2622660	2626300	Justin's his dad's senior, and it's always been that way since birth.
2626300	2627300	That was weird.
2627300	2633340	It really gets into the time travel aspect we've just begun to get into on this podcast.
2633340	2634340	Thank God.
2634340	2638300	Justin is one of the dudes from the camera.
2638300	2642180	And then software, I use Audacity to edit free and easy.
2642180	2643180	Yep.
2643180	2647460	Recently, Joe turned me on to Acid Pro 7, is that what it's called?
2647460	2649060	I think it's 7.
2649060	2650300	They might have 8 out now.
2650300	2651300	I can't remember.
2652020	2657420	It's an acid pro, and I got it in a humble bundle, is that what it's called?
2657420	2660820	I used acid when I was a kid.
2660820	2661820	And then the program is pretty cool too.
2661820	2662820	That makes a lot of sense.
2662820	2663820	Wowee.
2663820	2664820	Advanced.
2664820	2672700	Can you regale us with a story from your childhood?
2672700	2679860	I also, when I record my Wolf the Dog parts, I use Reaper, which is really excellent and
2679860	2684860	low priced if you want a pro quality digital audio workstation.
2684860	2685860	And you're always on acid.
2685860	2687380	And I'm always on acid.
2687380	2688380	Which really helps.
2688380	2689380	I'm never not on acid.
2689380	2691540	We're going to take this moment to shout out microdosing.
2691540	2692540	Microdosing.
2692540	2696540	Brought to you by the Tanini B people.
2696540	2701580	That humble bundle that did the acid pro, they've done that twice now, and both times
2701580	2704380	it's been a ton of really great audio programs.
2704380	2706780	I'm very excited to jump into it.
2706780	2710060	And we have colored microphone covers.
2710060	2711060	Mine's orange.
2711060	2712060	Mine's red.
2712060	2713060	Mine's green.
2713060	2714060	Mine's blue.
2714060	2715060	And mine's black.
2715060	2716060	Justin's is black.
2716060	2722340	All right, and just another reminder that this episode is going to be our release for
2722340	2727340	the Patreon that we are starting for this podcast to keep us going.
2727340	2731380	So hop on there, we'll put a link up on all the social media sites.
2731380	2736060	If you don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter, we're at PretendingPod on there.
2736060	2740540	And like we said earlier, Crush 36, did I get that right?
2740540	2741540	Yes, you did.
2741540	2748160	Crush 36 created a subreddit for us called r slash pretending to be people.
2748160	2752660	And in case you need to know the details of the Patreon, what we're going to do is donate
2752660	2757980	one individual donation at the highest level of the NPR donation level.
2757980	2765200	And then we're going to share the benefits with everyone who subscribes to our Patreon.
2765200	2771680	So $5 gets you the max NPR subscriber benefits.
2771680	2773480	We still have to talk to Terry about that.
2773480	2776280	That's our plan right now.
2776280	2780400	So hopefully you're all very interested in that.
2780400	2783800	Otherwise Luke gave $1,000 to NPR for nothing.
2783800	2785240	Which that's fine.
2785240	2787880	I got some socks out of it.
2787880	2788880	It was a...
2788880	2789880	A mug?
2789880	2790880	Some socks.
2790880	2791880	It was a...
2791880	2792880	Do you have a sock pun?
2792880	2795840	No, I have NPR socks that are...
2795840	2798280	It's Calamari Shapiro.
2798280	2799840	And it's Ari Shapiro's head on a...
2799840	2800840	Calamari is squid.
2800840	2802280	Oh, it's not made out of...
2802280	2803280	Okay.
2803280	2804280	I thought you meant scatman.
2804280	2807740	It's Calamari Shapiro and it's Ari Shapiro's head on a squid.
2807740	2808840	It's an actual NPR joke.
2808840	2809840	I actually have those socks.
2809840	2811640	Those are things you actually have, not a...
2811640	2812640	Yeah.
2812640	2813640	Okay.
2813640	2817280	BF Evans 19 asks, do you approach playing a recorded session differently than when you
2817280	2818280	play off mic?
2818280	2822420	And he also asked, has there been any aspect of podcasting that has surprised you or been
2822420	2824340	particularly interesting?
2824340	2829980	And I noticed as soon as we all put on headphones, we became more respectful of each other's
2829980	2830980	storytelling process.
2830980	2831980	That's a great point.
2831980	2835740	We didn't jump on each other's trains of thought as much.
2835740	2839280	Let me just jump on that too.
2839280	2843940	In the podcast, sometimes we do talk over each other a little bit, but not near as much
2843940	2846300	as we would if it was not being recorded.
2846300	2847300	Totally.
2847300	2851220	When everybody else's voice is right in your ears, it is harder to do.
2851220	2856140	And I still notice when we edit our tracks that we do it a lot.
2856140	2857940	It happens, but...
2857940	2860980	The thought process behind it is very similar though.
2860980	2869620	I just try to not be an asshole and not always succeed, but try not to be an asshole to my
2869620	2870620	fellow players.
2870620	2873480	Yeah, it's not like we're all your best friends.
2873480	2877180	I'm still trying to play the game or enjoy the game.
2877180	2879420	I think that's as far as it goes.
2879420	2884020	As far as playing or making jokes and stuff like that, I don't...
2884020	2886980	Yeah, the bare bones of it are no, there's no difference.
2886980	2891060	We're all joking with each other and pushing each other to do funny things.
2891060	2895860	I mean, the reason we did this is that we thought we're great.
2895860	2898460	You should hear it.
2898460	2901460	There's a hell of truth to that though, that we all realized we had something special going
2901460	2904140	on in those sessions we didn't record.
2904140	2905180	We super enjoyed it.
2905180	2906180	We all mixed together.
2906180	2911060	And it was the first group, I think, with all of us that we were like, I want to play
2911060	2914020	with this group as long as I possibly can.
2914020	2921740	Speaking of which, we also had BFEvans19 ask, what are your backgrounds in tabletop gaming?
2921740	2925260	Which I think we covered a little bit at the very beginning of episode one.
2925260	2927580	But that might be not in everybody's mind.
2927580	2929020	That was a while ago.
2929020	2932060	So something we might not have covered in that episode though, actually, is I think
2932060	2936500	almost all of us come to tabletop gaming through podcasts.
2936500	2940140	That's what made me want to play these kinds of games.
2940140	2941140	Absolutely.
2941140	2942140	Not me, honestly.
2942140	2943140	Yeah, not me either.
2943140	2944140	Uh, definitely me.
2944140	2948500	I was, uh, I got turned on to it all by Critical Role and I'm still a huge fan of theirs.
2948500	2953180	Um, yeah, I saw them and decided that that was something I wanted to do.
2953180	2957260	And then I mentioned this on the first episode, but Thomas kind of out of the blue, I don't
2957260	2959620	think you knew that I was watching that.
2959620	2964220	Just if I wanted to do a D&D game with some mutual friends.
2964220	2966420	And yeah, it was just lucky, serendipitous heaven stance.
2966420	2969820	And that was 2016?
2969820	2970820	Kind of.
2970820	2971820	Oh, I looked it up at the time.
2971820	2972820	I think something like that.
2972820	2973820	Yeah.
2973820	2978620	Kind of when role playing was just, you know, it was becoming this very accepted deal, popular.
2978620	2981580	We're not, we're not, uh, ostracized.
2981580	2982580	Yeah.
2982580	2984580	We're cooler than you.
2984580	2991540	Well, I mean, like for me, I, I played, I said this in the first episode, but I played
2991540	2996420	a D and D twice in high school, played it with a guy that was super serious with a group
2996420	2998100	that was not serious.
2998100	3001780	He did not invite us back to play with him.
3001780	3007580	And I, uh, always was like, anyone that was playing it, I was like, if you have room for
3007580	3008580	somebody, I'll jump in.
3008580	3012820	But most people have like groups that are pretty set up and yeah, so I never really
3012820	3019580	had the chance until I met, shout out to Alex, Alex, uh, he invited me to play with
3019580	3020580	you guys.
3020580	3024900	I think it was me, Alex, Taylor, Zach and Thomas at the time.
3024900	3027940	Alex is the most handsome man we know he is.
3027940	3033100	And I wish he was still here after me, Luke and Zach.
3033100	3037780	But uh, yeah, that's all for, yeah, and just, he's top six, top six.
3037780	3038780	Wow.
3039780	3040780	It wasn't about handsomeness.
3040780	3042780	Me and Joe got fucking thrown under the bus.
3042780	3043780	You ugly fucks.
3043780	3047220	It was just about who's friends with Alex, not.
3047220	3052620	If you guys would, if you guys would like to see pictures of Joe or Justin, you can
3052620	3056500	find them on our Instagram at at pretending pot.
3056500	3057500	You be the judge.
3057500	3064820	Oh, also if we get to 500 Patreon subscribers, there is a special boudoir picture of Thomas.
3064820	3065820	Oh no.
3065860	3071460	Oh, this is recently taken and it started my birthday off with a bang.
3071460	3072460	Bang.
3072460	3073460	Uh, yeah.
3073460	3075460	Anyway, invited by Alex to play with them.
3075460	3080180	I played one session or one campaign, I guess with them.
3080180	3082360	Uh, it was super fun.
3082360	3086300	We did it again and then now we're doing it again.
3086300	3087300	Yeah.
3087300	3092980	Uh, Justin here actually once texted me at 11 PM on a weeknight and was like, Hey, you
3092980	3096260	know that Delta green thing that I've been talking to you about?
3096260	3100900	And I'm like, I'm super down if, if, if you'll have me.
3100900	3106840	And uh, he had me, um, and yeah, no, he, uh, he hit me up and I went over there and we
3106840	3109780	roleplayed, we played a shotgun scenario.
3109780	3114740	Uh, our friend Sam ran us through it as the first handler I ever had.
3114740	3115740	Shout out to Sam.
3115740	3116740	Shout out to Sam.
3116740	3117740	Got me into roleplaying.
3117740	3119700	Uh, Justin invited me over.
3119700	3127060	The two of us played agents and we played through the scenario, uh, last things last.
3127060	3129380	That scenario is fucking awesome.
3129380	3132660	And it completely got me kickstarted into this game.
3132660	3133660	Yeah.
3133660	3139460	I, uh, I remember getting invited not by Sam actually, but by Tyler who was living with
3139460	3140460	Sam at the time.
3140460	3148260	Uh, no, Tyler, uh, Tyler Thrasher people might know him from Tyler Thrasher art.
3148260	3150700	No curiosity.
3150700	3161260	And as Zach's glares at me, dead face, I was just resting, I'm sorry.
3161260	3162860	You show your fucking mouth, Thomas.
3162860	3164740	How did you get into roleplaying Justin?
3164740	3169980	Well, my friend, my friend Tyler Thrasher, uh, invited me and he's actually going to
3169980	3176260	be Tyler Thrasher beam.
3176260	3177260	They got married.
3177260	3178260	He took his hand.
3178260	3179260	They hyphenated it.
3179260	3186160	Uh, he invited me and I did, this was maybe a year before I invited Zach and I was super
3186160	3188540	into the idea, but I was kinda like, yeah, I don't know.
3188540	3192460	It seems like it can seem impenetrable from the outside.
3192460	3195780	Like like Luke said, people have these groups and you're like, I don't know if I'll fit
3195780	3196780	in.
3196780	3197780	I don't know what to do.
3197780	3201380	It's like there's all these rules and rule books, but he made it really accessible and
3201380	3203020	fun.
3203020	3206720	And me and Zach had started hanging out and I was like, you're going to love this.
3206720	3211540	There's a performative aspect to it, but it has all this like cool like world building
3211540	3216360	and story stuff and all this other stuff and I just knew Zach would be hopefully super
3216360	3217360	into it.
3217360	3220900	And then that kind of started off a lot of this stuff, which is really interesting.
3220900	3224880	And everything you just described is to me the strength of Delta green over a lot of
3224880	3227660	other role playing systems.
3227660	3233000	And also the strength of Zach as a DM is, well, I would say mostly the strength of friendship
3233640	3236120	That's what binds us all together.
3236120	3242400	Because like the most fun thing is getting to create this wacky, crazy story with friends
3242400	3247640	where we don't have to play on the tropes of normal storytelling because we don't, at
3247640	3251120	the end of the day, have tons of control over where the story goes.
3251120	3253280	I mean, we roll dice all the time.
3253280	3254760	What do you mean, we?
3254760	3256920	And that's the beautiful thing about all role playing.
3256920	3257920	Yes.
3257920	3264920	Like for instance, in the hotel motel, Rosemary was going to slit Keith's throat open and
3264920	3270320	Joe rolled a critical success on a persuade and that's what kept her from literally just
3270320	3272800	like murdering Keith right in front of you guys.
3272800	3274320	Keith, say thank you.
3274320	3275320	Thanks, Joe.
3275320	3276320	I regret it.
3276320	3279320	I regret it to this day.
3279320	3282920	Well, I'll think about that in the future.
3282920	3289680	Well, I mean, also, I mean, in the last episode, like me shooting at the Kevin and missing,
3289680	3293400	it's like that could have could have gone completely everything.
3293400	3294560	Everything could always turn out different.
3294560	3295680	Like crit success.
3295680	3296680	It's awesome.
3296680	3297680	Absolutely.
3297680	3298680	Crit fail.
3298680	3304600	You have something in your mind that you want to do and it's not up to me or to Zach whether
3304600	3305600	it happens.
3305600	3307340	It's up to purely a dice roll.
3307340	3312980	Another thing, like another example would be when you guys asked about Julie Maxwell
3312980	3317640	in the hospital after her drunk driving incident and I said, yeah, let me roll for it real
3317640	3325320	quick to see if she's healthy and then rolled a 100 and she's so she died completely.
3325320	3328620	I mean, yeah, the dice changed the game.
3328620	3330460	It's so much people.
3330460	3331460	Yeah.
3331460	3333820	Pete, I'm getting really fired up about this.
3333820	3336980	I'm tired of people on Twitter saying the dice don't change the game.
3336980	3337980	I understand.
3337980	3342860	They think that we write the scripts ahead of time and then have recorded them and mostly
3342860	3348180	we do, but that's not for them to say and it's rude that they keep saying it.
3348180	3349180	Okay.
3349180	3350180	Let's see.
3350180	3351180	What's the next question?
3351180	3352180	It's rude.
3352180	3353180	It's rude.
3353180	3358460	I got a question from Lil Sleepy on Instagram has an important question.
3358460	3362980	What is Clark Bishop's favorite Eagles song?
3362980	3363980	It's gotta be Desperado.
3363980	3364980	Desperado.
3364980	3371800	Why don't you come to your sand sales?
3371800	3381020	You've been out riding fan sales for so long now upon a band.
3381020	3383900	Thomas, what do you think Clark Bishop's favorite Eagle song is?
3383900	3384900	Desperado.
3384900	3388060	How did you know?
3388060	3389540	It's just a hunch.
3389540	3395940	I think Keith Vigna's favorite Eagles song is Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh.
3395940	3396940	Canonical.
3396940	3401500	Joe Walsh was in the Eagles, so it's technically an Eagles song.
3401500	3406120	I also played it when we were on cocaine earlier in the season.
3406120	3410900	This is a little bit on the spot, but what is your character's favorite song?
3410900	3412500	So I was actually going to bring this up earlier.
3412500	3418060	Somebody asked about how we craft our characters and for me, a lot of times it's trying to
3418060	3422660	think about what music they would listen to and I did not do that for Clark, so I can't
3422660	3423660	do it this easy.
3423660	3426140	I never knew you'd do that for any character.
3426140	3427140	I love that.
3427140	3428260	It's a really cool approach.
3428260	3429900	What do you think it would be though?
3429900	3430900	I don't know.
3430900	3431900	I'd have to think about it.
3431900	3437260	My old character Dash was this ex-military guy and I dove deep into like Three Doors
3437260	3445060	Down and all those bands you hear in military commercials to get into that character.
3445060	3446060	Wait.
3446060	3454280	I'm trying to think of what Clark Bishop's favorite song is.
3454280	3457820	It would be something that would show up on an easy listening radio station.
3457820	3460100	It would not be terribly good.
3460100	3464260	Just like easy listening, serious radio.
3464260	3466780	The truth is that I bet Clark doesn't care about music much.
3466780	3469700	I bet that's not part of his life and his recreation.
3469700	3474500	He's the kind of guy who says, oh, I don't really care for music.
3474940	3475940	It's like, what?
3475940	3476940	What do you mean?
3476940	3478540	I hear it when I hear it.
3478540	3481260	He's more of a podcast guy.
3481260	3487220	So I really like that you think of what your character would listen to before you create
3487220	3492380	it and John Lee Pettymore was not created like that at all, but he is named after the
3492380	3495660	Steve Earle song Copperhead Road.
3495660	3499740	The very first line in that song is my name's John Lee Pettymore.
3499740	3503700	Same as my daddy and my daddy before.
3504220	3509140	I missed, I constantly over the recording of this got mistaken whether or not it should
3509140	3514060	be John Lee Pettymore the third or the fourth, but canonically with the song, it should be
3514060	3515060	the fourth.
3515060	3516060	All right.
3516060	3517060	Well, from here on out.
3517060	3520980	That's John Lee Pettymore's musical background and that is also a song John Lee Pettymore
3520980	3521980	would love.
3521980	3522980	So.
3522980	3523980	Yeah.
3523980	3524980	Right.
3524980	3525980	So you're the fourth now, right?
3525980	3526980	You're like, you've always been the fourth.
3526980	3531260	I'm pretty sure it started out as the fourth and I switched to the third fucking shit
3531260	3532260	up.
3532820	3533820	I can't believe you did that.
3533820	3534820	Me either.
3534820	3539740	Well, thankfully it's not a huge deal.
3539740	3546260	Keith's would be, uh, his favorite genre of music is what can he sing at karaoke?
3546260	3550780	Uh, so he likes cheeseburger in paradise.
3550780	3552820	He loves the Doobie brothers.
3552820	3558140	Pretty much any, any, uh, like yacht rock he's really into, but yeah, I would say cheeseburger
3558140	3559940	in paradise, probably Keith's.
3559940	3567460	And then I want to ask, what would Wolf the dog's favorite song be?
3567460	3568660	It's obvious.
3568660	3571500	I think I know what it is.
3571500	3572500	It's kudzu.
3572500	3573500	It's kudzu.
3573500	3574500	Are you sure?
3574500	3578380	I don't think he likes it very much.
3578380	3580980	That's his purgatory.
3580980	3588060	I imagine Wolf the dog sits in a corner and just listens to a low hum and he just turns
3588060	3594700	on whenever like the radio signals are active.
3594700	3597180	Also shout out to kudzu.
3597180	3603100	If you haven't gone and listened to them on bandcamp or on Spotify now to Spotify and
3603100	3609820	bandcamp, they have more songs than no backbone and they have better songs and no backbone
3609820	3610820	on us.
3610820	3614740	Oh, almost all those songs are better than the backbone, but ours is just, we picked
3614740	3615740	the worst.
3615740	3616740	Yeah.
3616740	3617740	Ours is just good for a podcast.
3617740	3619900	And I don't care that you think it's the worst.
3619900	3622060	I'm going to use it as the theme song.
3622060	3625020	And they said, no, please take one of our other songs.
3625020	3627180	All this stuff is way more jazzy, funky.
3627180	3628180	It's a little...
3628180	3631460	They're a pop punk band.
3631460	3633620	Little jazz trio named kudzu.
3633620	3636860	No, but go check them out.
3636860	3637860	They're great.
3637860	3638860	They are amazing.
3638860	3642620	One of the best bands out of a really great town for local music.
3642620	3643620	Absolutely.
3643620	3646920	We do have a lot of great, great bands out here.
3646920	3650960	We will mention them later on in the podcast.
3650960	3657120	So guys, thank you for listening to this Q&A episode.
3657120	3661320	Basically this is our announcement for the Patreon that we're going to do to keep the
3661320	3662700	show alive.
3662700	3664720	We really want to keep the show alive.
3664720	3665720	Yeah.
3665720	3667580	We're really happy doing it.
3667580	3672620	We really enjoy doing it and you know, if we don't make it, that's fine.
3672620	3676900	We'll just keep recording and I'll send all the edits to the boys and we'll have a really
3676900	3679700	fun home game.
3679700	3682900	With lots of cool...
3682900	3700140	So with all that being said, we did say this was a recap episode and we did do some recapping
3700140	3702380	within answering some of the questions.
3702380	3710940	We did some spoilies and whatnot, but I am here today to finish this episode with a full
3710940	3717620	recap of everything, maybe not quite everything, but everything that's happened in the show
3717620	3720960	so far.
3720960	3723100	Keith Vigno wears large pants.
3723100	3724820	He wears suspenders as well as a belt.
3724820	3728220	Drew has lots of gum showing like his top lip is receding.
3728220	3730500	Dogs are howling in the old neighborhood.
3730500	3732100	It's the chief's birthday.
3732100	3734340	Drew brought her a yellow journal.
3734340	3736420	Now you have all three colors.
3736420	3738020	Clark got her a box of chocolates.
3738020	3741180	John gives her two thirds full bottle of cheap bourbon.
3741180	3743420	Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday present.
3743420	3747060	She did, however, receive a box with a single rose, a white hard hat and a black silk bow
3747060	3748580	tie before leaving town.
3748580	3749660	I'm so sorry.
3749660	3751140	Is it going to be this detailed?
3751140	3752420	No, it's absolutely not.
3752420	3755720	Julie Maxwell called in to report a dead body at the piston junkyard and then crashed your
3755720	3758580	car driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital.
3758580	3763580	The body found at the piston junkyard had a brand on the back reading, this is a fool.
3763580	3767840	Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and she is pissed.
3767840	3770460	Jimmy Sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on mushrooms.
3770460	3774700	Mildred Mitchell, that old kooky pot head, saw a bright flash of light from across the
3774700	3776540	street in John Peter's house.
3776540	3778540	John Peters is missing.
3778540	3779540	Herdy at a long...
3779540	3780540	The farmer?
3780540	3781540	God damn it.
3781540	3782540	Herdy at a long...
3782540	3783540	That's the one thing we didn't address.
3783540	3784540	That's such a bummer.
3784540	3785540	We didn't mean to do that.
3785540	3786540	I completely forgot.
3786540	3789700	I haven't listened to Night F Fiddle in so long, but that's my bad.
3789700	3792500	It's just conscious, subconscious, weird thing.
3792500	3793500	My bad.
3793500	3794500	Sorry, I made it confusing.
3794500	3795500	Just a plain ass name.
3795500	3796500	John Peters is missing.
3796500	3798260	Herdy at a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago.
3798260	3804400	Two people came to John Peters' house, packed a trunk into their white Toyota and took off.
3804400	3806540	The officers went to Chief Maggie Cook's house.
3806540	3807540	She wasn't there.
3807540	3810780	They went to Klinker's, the bar run by Harry Klinker with a daycare in the back.
3810780	3813940	When Keith was a child, he liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread.
3813940	3818180	Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for
3818180	3819900	killing her sister Ashley.
3819900	3824040	John found the chief's blue notebook, but her red and yellow notebooks were missing.
3824040	3827700	Some idiot at the city hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell in the morgue.
3827700	3830060	She came to and started screaming.
3830060	3834120	County said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years
3834120	3836700	ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday.
3836700	3840900	Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters, went to the police station to
3840900	3844640	get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash
3844640	3846060	in the parking lot.
3846060	3848620	Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot.
3848620	3852580	He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless
3852580	3853580	people.
3853580	3856300	He heard himself falling from the emergency hatch in the back.
3856300	3861060	John Lee Pettymore seems to believe some hooded robot man gave him a message.
3861060	3866340	The crash in the police station parking lot was a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's
3866340	3870020	truck while it sat parked in the police station lot.
3870140	3874980	Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania.
3874980	3878460	She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge.
3878460	3881440	Officer Clark Bishop then shot and killed Julie Maxwell.
3881440	3885300	The two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before disappearing.
3885300	3888460	Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters.
3888460	3892420	Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that
3892420	3895100	the hooded robot man gave John.
3895100	3898020	It said, I killed the chief's pops, John.
3898020	3899180	Keith is in a wheelchair.
3899180	3902880	The officers broke into John Peters' storage units and found lots of things.
3902880	3907480	One thing they found was so smelly they decided not to open it until back at the station because
3907480	3910100	they wanted the station to smell bad.
3910100	3912900	They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul.
3912900	3917620	In the nasty plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small sphere in the middle,
3917620	3920680	sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body.
3920680	3921940	John pocketed it.
3921940	3925620	The officers went to the woods, found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground,
3925620	3929700	realized they were being watched, freaked out, wrecked the four-wheeler, ran into trees,
3929700	3936460	and overall just super fucked up, including Clark flying a drone into himself.
3936460	3940860	Then they went to Julie Maxwell's, wore her taxidermy, found a circled yellow pages
3940860	3945300	ad for Dr. Marie Jacobs and a receipt from Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market.
3945300	3949400	They went to Forgotten Treasures and found the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from
3949400	3951160	Mildred Mitchell's booth.
3951160	3952560	They went to Mildred's house.
3952560	3955620	She didn't know about the items recently sold at her booth.
3955620	3959080	She assumes her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell, was selling things at her booth.
3959080	3963480	Tildy B. Mitchell came downstairs, freaked out when she saw cops, and ran into her room.
3963480	3967920	But when Clark busted in, Tildy B. pointed the strange gun at him and then disappeared
3967920	3969400	in a massive flash of light.
3969400	3975520	Is it realistic that Tildy B. was selling the things at a flea market and not on Etsy?
3975520	3978960	They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own
3978960	3982220	life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her.
3982220	3986440	Upon leaving, the white Toyota they had been searching for peeled out onto the road after
3986440	3987920	a short, dangerous pursuit.
3987920	3992220	Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan, John Lee Pettymore fired warning shots into the
3992220	3997120	air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man tied up in the trunk.
3997120	4000240	Keith took the ambulance with the unconscious bald man to the clinic.
4000240	4004120	Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when
4004120	4009520	they saw an unkempt man, who we now know as James the mill worker, frantically vacuuming
4009520	4010640	his lawn.
4010640	4012200	This ended in tragedy.
4012200	4015760	But Clark, John, and James all made it out with their lives.
4015760	4020780	Our brave and heroic contention police officer, Keith Vigna, was made unconscious by Billy
4020780	4025760	Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened
4025760	4030840	the woman at Forgotten Treasures, both of which told officers they were friends of John
4030840	4031840	Peters.
4032560	4035520	Dr. Marie Jacobs seemed to be up to no good.
4035520	4039960	Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man-sized fecal matter in the litter box, and the doctor
4039960	4046360	yelled, Salem, prompting something to begin running up the stairs from the basement.
4046360	4052840	The talented and beloved contention police officer, Keith Vigna, found himself sans uniform,
4052840	4055220	weapon, and cruiser at the clinic.
4055220	4057240	He had to call his partners to pick him up.
4057240	4061400	Meanwhile, officers Bishop and Pettymore detained Dr. Marie Jacobs and her blood-covered
4061400	4066280	husband Doug Jacobs in a cell at the contention police department.
4066280	4070760	Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased Charles' room at Hotel
4070760	4073920	Motel, guns drawn in sans warrant.
4073920	4079200	There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz.
4079200	4084360	The woman we now know as Rosemary whipped a knife out at Officer Vigna after these so-called
4084360	4086580	peacekeepers pulled their guns out.
4086580	4091700	The party had Rosemary pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna engaged her in hand-to-hand
4091700	4094820	combat resulting in a hostage situation for the copper.
4094820	4100100	Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing her coworker, but the sweet-talkin'
4100100	4104860	officer Bishop managed to keep her from killing him there on the spot.
4104860	4109580	When the old, wiry lady made a run for it over the railing and into the parking lot,
4109580	4113900	all three officers unloaded their weapons from the second-floor corridor, bringing her
4113900	4116620	down before she could get into her vehicle.
4116620	4121980	The officers patched her up and sent her to the hospital with Lauren, the only decent
4121980	4123980	officer left in contention.
4123980	4127940	The officers planned a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger running
4127940	4131320	about contention who's wearing an official police uniform.
4131320	4134820	The sting operation was actually a good idea, but the FBI was watching and stepped in on
4134820	4135820	the whole thing.
4135820	4140500	Agents Kennedy and McKinley were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it.
4140500	4144660	The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow morning, December
4144660	4146460	4th at the police department.
4146460	4149900	When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures,
4149900	4154180	Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them he went to
4154180	4155600	the chief's house.
4155600	4159780	Officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual residences
4159780	4162220	while Keith went to the chief's house to check on Drew.
4162220	4166100	Officers Bishop and Pettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded,
4166100	4171100	leaving the unconscious Officer Vigna and Drew Andrews on the cold yard.
4171100	4176100	That explosion also left behind the burned bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook,
4176100	4180540	and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat.
4180540	4184940	That man we now know as James the Mill Worker.
4184940	4187780	Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car had been in the mill on the other side of
4187780	4190060	the city since the night of December 1st.
4190060	4194260	The County Coroner reports that during the investigation of an active crime scene, Officer
4194260	4199100	John Lee Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved a possible murder weapon into the
4199100	4204020	eye socket of the deceased Chief Maggie Cook, fumbling and digging around atrociously as
4204020	4209140	the charred bones themselves began to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation.
4209140	4210140	No.
4210140	4215880	Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use.
4215880	4220860	This is cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of
4220860	4223820	a missing person, that missing person being John Peters.
4223820	4228080	The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals.
4228080	4230460	The names of the deceased are not yet being released.
4230460	4234780	More importantly, however, the officers take a while to order breakfast, finally deciding
4234780	4239980	on Bishop's big bean breakfast from beans on beans.
4239980	4244580	The officers are also dealing with a situation where an Officer Bishop seems to be in more
4244580	4246300	than one place at a time.
4246300	4248740	He has no recollection of this.
4248740	4254860	The FBI agents come in, use the Nike bag by dropping in a small silver sphere, making
4254860	4260100	sure not to touch it, and then recruit the officers into some unknown organization by
4260100	4264140	giving them a phone number and telling them to eliminate the threat and keep it all out
4264140	4265140	of the news.
4265140	4267540	It's all probably fine.
4267540	4268540	Flashback!
4268540	4272060	Clark found himself locked in the public library with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely
4272060	4273060	dark.
4273060	4275900	The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit.
4275900	4280420	That sadly was not the worst of it because Clark got back home only to find his reality
4280420	4286780	shattering, eventually remembering the confession of the woman who killed his parents.
4286780	4291340	Back in current times, the officers went to the Daily Fuh after Gary Daley called in to
4291340	4293900	report information about the Chief's disappearance.
4293900	4297820	They learned the Chief arrived to her home accompanied by James the mill worker and another
4297820	4300060	man who held them at gunpoint.
4300060	4303820	The gunman was an all black and had a scar over his eye.
4303820	4308620	Gary Daley saw this man because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who
4308620	4311260	took Drew to the Chief's home.
4311260	4316440	The officers, always utilizing their time efficiently, spent a while asking Gary Daley
4316440	4322180	about the art he has hanging in his restaurant.
4322180	4323180	That was relevant.
4323180	4329260	John Lee and Don D. Pettymore gave us a glimpse into the accident that propelled John into
4329260	4330960	a life of civic duty.
4330960	4334840	They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the
4334840	4339640	pair of Pettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie, roughing up Don's car in the
4339640	4341520	parking lot.
4341520	4346720	The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Pettymore seeing his second cousin
4346720	4352340	father figure scorch Large Eddie's fist with only his hand.
4352340	4355400	Back in the current timeline, the officers went to the First Church of Contention which
4355400	4360400	was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children
4360400	4362480	served by the youth group.
4362480	4368160	The officers, well, Keith, broke into Pastor Adam Kane's office, stole the motorcycle
4368160	4372400	helmet he bought from Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures, and learned
4372400	4378360	that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets.
4378360	4382940	Turns out, maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly
4382940	4385040	preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson.
4385040	4387040	Or he's played by Luke.
4387040	4389120	That's not an excuse.
4389120	4391700	Pastor Vigna is the worst person in contention.
4391700	4396440	While playing on their family sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring
4396440	4401040	as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the
4401040	4403680	Bean's personal security.
4403680	4407880	Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that
4407880	4409900	says he will save the world.
4409900	4413420	Back in whatever year it is now, the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station
4413420	4417620	and locked it up with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures.
4417620	4421620	The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station.
4421620	4431260	Unsurprisingly, the Keith was not of Keith, the picture was not of Keith, but of two men
4431260	4437780	in a strange room that lacked color.
4437780	4441140	On the way to the mill on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in the
4441140	4447460	sky causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention.
4447460	4452280	A minivan was run off the road by Officer Pettymore, a former teen sprint car racer
4452280	4457360	who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.
4457360	4463220	The minivan flipped and caught fire.
4463220	4466320	Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage.
4466320	4468820	The boy is at the clinic in critical condition.
4468820	4473860	The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and other passenger who were both trapped
4473860	4475180	in the vehicle.
4475180	4480020	Officer Vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose, and the memories of a particularly
4480020	4483900	traumatic childhood Christmas.
4483900	4488060	A vocal group of the contention population are protesting and letting these officers
4488060	4489540	know how they feel.
4489540	4493620	Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about
4493620	4498260	missing persons, animals in the ponds and creeks, and a voicemail from the feds.
4498260	4502020	Doug, Dr. Marie Jacobs' husband who is currently inhabiting the body of their cat Salem, showed
4502020	4508340	the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get
4508340	4510420	them in the ponds and creeks.
4510420	4515660	Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member, also lover, revealed
4515660	4519540	some interesting information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John
4519540	4524700	found in Julie Maxwell's car as well as about Cole's orphanage.
4524700	4528380	In James the Millworker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table,
4528380	4532140	a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials, and a small enclave behind an oil painting
4532140	4536620	of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out,
4536620	4542300	and a 12-foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at
4542300	4543300	the bottom.
4543300	4544540	I always am.
4544540	4549760	A heavy artillery weapon is being fired into the house from the front yard.
4549760	4553460	Then we had combat from the time the robot man blasted the door from its frame to when
4553460	4557620	the robot man almost cut Officer Bishop's arm off to when the robot man froze at the
4557620	4561540	command of Officer Pettymore to when the robot man's torso flew out the window, gripping
4561540	4563940	the throat of Officer Vigna.
4563940	4565540	Skyrockets in flight, baby.
4565540	4567260	Show me armogato.
4567260	4570980	Thank beans he poked that Terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the
4570980	4575940	metal fella exploded like fireworks earlier in the evening.
4575940	4580020	The officers then cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot man with feelings,
4580020	4581020	perhaps?
4581020	4587220	Keith Vigna found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of
4587220	4588780	the stringless piano.
4588780	4593260	Clark Bishop found in the flipped-over coffee table blueprints for Calm Comfy Campground,
4593260	4597900	a suspiciously planned-out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that
4597900	4599980	sits on Lake Calm.
4599980	4605120	A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of the two corpses
4605120	4609060	they found in the pit under the trap door that Bishop fell into.
4609100	4612660	Sitting in James the Millworker's house, the officers remember that he died in Chief
4612660	4617160	Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down, and a plate of foot meat.
4617160	4621000	They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the
4621000	4624980	night she took off, the red rose, the white hard hat, and the black silk bowtie, all of
4624980	4630540	which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue, respectively.
4630540	4637220	After undressing the bottom half of the still-standing robot man, the gang finds a logo on the smooth
4637220	4638500	pelvic area.
4638500	4641780	It is an M made out of four double helices.
4641780	4646740	They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser trunk.
4646740	4648780	Keith's cruiser's trunk.
4648780	4652740	After officers Bishop and Vigna had the most uncomfortable dinner since the last supper,
4652740	4655140	some really plot-heavy shit went down.
4655140	4657580	Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Frances Beanes.
4657580	4661380	Upon accepting her proposal, the two are driving east, away from contention.
4661380	4666340	John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over a shared fortune after a smooth transaction,
4666340	4671020	and Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his own window and then woke up in an unfamiliar
4671020	4673700	place with an unfamiliar face.
4673700	4678820	Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother.
4678820	4682440	He then murdered that woman and stole the watch that was passed down from William Beanes
4682440	4686940	off of Fergie's corpse, then he laid in his bed at Hotel Motel.
4686940	4690780	Officer John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews were being held hostage by Rosemary, who works
4690780	4694460	for Marvin Glass, after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins.
4694540	4696860	Clark Bishop was inducted into the Circle of Knowledge.
4696860	4699900	There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past.
4699900	4705700	Clark then headed back to contention in a cab from the mill on the other side of the city.
4705700	4709580	The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th,
4709580	4715020	along with Drew and their new partner in crime, Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family.
4715020	4720260	In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork.
4720260	4725100	Clark shot him with a dart, and agent Trent Chad became very impressionable.
4725100	4729380	With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince
4729380	4733700	the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control
4733700	4734700	in contention.
4734700	4738900	The officers found their cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty.
4738900	4742900	Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into
4742900	4745820	the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely.
4745820	4749200	Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1 p.m.
4749200	4753360	They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube
4753360	4755660	covered radio.
4755660	4759600	The officers grab the strange gun and camera and head off to the city with Doug, who is
4759600	4761880	in the body of agent Trent Chad.
4761880	4763880	Rosemary is driving separately.
4763880	4767100	There is a severe lack of traffic and human life in contention.
4767100	4771860	The town is loud, though, with plenty of animals filling up the ponds and creeks.
4771860	4775880	The officers stock up on weapons and throw on body armor at Clark Bishop's house.
4775880	4779220	Keith brings his very small, very powerful gun.
4779220	4782480	On the way, they call Harry Klinker and basically tell him everything that's been happening.
4782480	4784320	Harry says Gary didn't come home last night.
4784320	4787120	Pettymore asks if he's been acting weirder than normal.
4787120	4791020	Harry says not really, but that he's been meeting with his group more often than usual.
4791020	4794920	Harry clarifies that it's a group of spiritualists and metaphysics thinkers, including Gary,
4794920	4798040	Dr. Marie Jacobs, and Mildred Mitchell.
4798040	4803600	They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell.
4803600	4810880	It would have been way better if they were Harry and Gary Derry.
4810880	4814660	They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell at her house, says
4814660	4816920	that she's having a bit of a breakdown.
4816920	4819920	Gary describes the group as a...
4819920	4822800	Sorry.
4822800	4826720	Vape break, bro.
4826720	4830280	They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell at her house, says
4830280	4832040	that she's having a bit of a breakdown.
4832040	4834640	Gary describes the group as a sorcerer's guild.
4834640	4836880	Gary says it's been years since they'd sorcered anything.
4836880	4837880	Harry Potter fanfic.
4837880	4838880	Jesus.
4838880	4839880	Dude, keep coughing, you'll get higher, bro.
4839880	4840880	You don't cough those crystals up.
4840880	4841880	I'm sorry.
4841880	4850000	You don't have your pen in here, do you?
4850000	4853620	He also mentions Carrie Pages, who got the protesters all riled up.
4853620	4856440	She might have had something going on, and she had a lot of power.
4856440	4860360	Clarke worries that this is all his fault, since he couldn't find her dog.
4860520	4863800	Gary mentions that Mildred keeps staring at a picture that she thinks somehow changed.
4863800	4867800	It's a picture of the founders of the town, and she is dead certain that Silas Cole looks
4867800	4869440	different than he did before.
4869440	4871560	Gary thinks he looks the exact same.
4871560	4876260	Mildred keeps saying he's not as attractive as he used to be, and now he's dumber looking?
4876260	4880720	She also says that in a reflection and a piece of glass in the picture is Tildy B. Mitchell.
4880720	4884680	Pettymore asks if Gary would describe his grandfather as a wizard.
4884680	4886560	Gary says definitely.
4886760	4890720	Gary explains further that Gary was always afraid to let them know, as he thought it
4890720	4892240	might have some sort of reaction.
4892240	4895540	Gary's grandfather gave him a book, and it had three pages left in it, and he was to
4895540	4907840	read those pages after tearing them out of the book and then spill blood upon your heads.
4907840	4911280	When Gary did that, the words danced like magic on the page and came off like sparks.
4911280	4913360	It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.
4913360	4917000	It surrounded you guys in this light, and he did it because the three of them are the
4917000	4918600	key to everything.
4918600	4921680	Gary only knows that he'd done his part, and the rest was up to them.
4921680	4925380	Gary's grandfather didn't tell him exactly what happened, but that, quote, fortune would
4925380	4927040	be on your side.
4927040	4931800	As the phone call comes to a close, Gary mentions that Mildred hates you guys, and you should
4931800	4933600	probably avoid her.
4933600	4938520	They get to the city, and Rosemary leads them into a parking garage below a massive skyscraper.
4938520	4942460	There's an elevator door, and John Lee Pettymore, Keith Vigna, and Clark Bishop get into the
4942460	4943460	elevator.
4943460	4948580	The wall on the other side of the black onyx walled elevator opens into a dark room.
4948580	4951580	The boys walk in, and the door behind them shuts.
4951580	4952900	Nice.
4952900	4956100	Hell yeah.
4956100	4961300	There, they meet Marvin Glass.
4961300	4963900	How many of you can make yourself burp?
4963900	4964900	Nobody.
4964900	4965900	Everyone's shaking their head now.
4965900	4967900	Oh my god, that's disgusting.
4967900	4968900	Stop.
4968900	4969900	There.
4969900	4970900	Stop it.
4971460	4973460	Stop it.
4973460	4977140	I don't like that.
4977140	4978140	You love it.
4978140	4979140	This is good content.
4979140	4981220	If you guys don't subscribe to the Patreon, then-
4981220	4983940	That will continue.
4983940	4986840	There they meet Marvin Glass, someone with a massive frame.
4986840	4991700	It is completely gaunt, no muscle or fat, skin stretched across long bones.
4991700	4996420	They're in a fitted black tuxedo, and the spotlight shows off a bright red bowtie and
4996420	5000140	only reaches to illuminate the lower half of that person's face.
5000140	5002620	The skin on the chin is almost translucent with no hair.
5002620	5005180	It has two thin, bright red lips.
5005180	5011140	Not even quite lips at all, just red lipstick encircling a round hole above the sharp chin.
5011140	5012140	And he says-
5012140	5020180	I'm so sorry, but real quick, in an episode of 30 Rock, Jonathan says to Liz, your mouth
5020180	5023660	looks like somebody kicked a hole in a bag of flour.
5023660	5026500	God, that's incredible.
5026500	5027940	All right.
5027940	5028940	Anyway.
5028940	5036460	Basically accuses John Lee Pettymore of buying lost cocaine off of Ferguson beans.
5036460	5037460	Never.
5037460	5038460	Yeah.
5038460	5045340	And there is some confusion over Rosemary's obsession with getting the gun.
5045340	5049740	Marvin Glass also says that it's good to see Keith, you know, everyone's favorite fuck
5049740	5052460	up that he hired to murder his own brother.
5052460	5054500	And Keith denies, but-
5054500	5056620	I deny both of those things.
5056620	5057620	Yeah.
5057620	5060420	He casts and fills the room and all the officers fall unconscious.
5060420	5066700	I trust my fellow officers, this is stupid, as I hope they trust me.
5066700	5070600	You guys woke up in metal cages hanging from the ceiling and outlined the smokey, dimly
5070600	5071600	lit room.
5071600	5076820	There are three other cages next to yours, each inhabited by a person stripped down to
5076820	5077820	their underwear.
5077820	5078820	Okay.
5078820	5080420	I wrote way too much for this.
5080420	5081420	Yeah.
5081420	5082420	This one can be-
5082420	5083420	It's going back to how the first one was.
5083420	5084420	Yeah, it is.
5084420	5089900	I've had a theory about why Rosemary was so into that gun for so long now.
5089900	5093620	We can talk about it off mic after this.
5093620	5096300	Don't talk at- don't talk off mic.
5096300	5099460	I'm just- I'm just talking to you.
5099460	5104540	Fifteen feet below is a crowd of 20 or so fancily clad individuals, each parking in-
5104540	5105540	This is too much.
5105540	5106540	It's way too much.
5106540	5107540	I was about to say-
5107540	5109020	That's how you described it to us in the episode.
5109020	5111180	All the other stuff was very concise.
5111180	5113300	This is also going to be the one that they just listened to.
5113300	5114300	Oh yeah.
5114300	5116300	And then you guys got it from there.
5116300	5117300	What?
5117300	5118300	Okay.
5118300	5119300	That was a-
5119300	5120300	Dude better than that.
5120300	5121300	Zach, that was good.
5121300	5122300	Do you want to record it?
5122300	5123300	Yeah.
5123300	5124300	I think on this-
5124300	5129700	I think that was a really- that was a really solid run through.
5129700	5130700	Yeah.
5130700	5131700	Let's lay one down.
5131700	5136260	And then the episode last week happened and you guys are caught up to what's happening
5136260	5138500	right now.
5138500	5144140	So thanks for joining us for this Q&A and recap episode of Pretending to be People.

5158700	5162540	systems other than Delta Green and Pulp Cthulhu.
5162540	5165380	And we have plenty of other questions to answer too.
