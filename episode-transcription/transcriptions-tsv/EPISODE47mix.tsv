0	6700	Shoot, dang boy, I can't believe that time machine I bought off the internet actually
6700	12540	worked and I managed to squeeze my producer in that little thing with me.
12540	18520	It was gonna be a tight squeeze but my barrel of meat grease helped us slip and slide right
18520	19760	in y'all.
19760	26120	We are broadcasting live from 25 years ago in contention once again.
26120	33080	No matter what reality or time-space continuum we are in, we are always right here for y'all
33080	42720	at 694.2 PTBP, the world's only time-traveling pirate radio station.
42720	48840	Now this timeline's howlin' with Wolf is from At Matt Makes Messes who tweeted about
48840	56760	the show and tagged At Pretending Pod a remarkably helpful, cool, and easy thing to do.
56760	63060	He writes, Contention PD has issued a warning for residents to be on the lookout for a devilishly
63060	70920	handsome 6 foot 1 British man with brown hair and brown eyes who goes by At Matt Makes Messes
70920	72320	on Twitter.
72320	79320	This individual has been seen being too attractive for his own damn good and CPD have warned
79320	85980	not to approach this individual for fear of him talking to you about RPGs and other useless
85980	89520	nerdy shit for far too long.
89520	95360	If you have any information please contact Officer Poppy Cox of the Contention Police
95360	96360	Department.
96360	104960	Well Matt Makes Messes, you may be beautiful, you may be tall, heck you might even be British
104960	111280	for all I know, but I'd like to see if you can make as big a mess as I can boy.
111280	118000	I've made houses unlivable just by being near them, cleared out an entire neighborhood with
118000	124640	the stank that my mess produces, I have made a dumpster behind an all-you-can-eat buffet,
124640	133560	my residence, my kingdom, the rats gather around my grease-coated frame, I am the king
133560	142480	of mess and you will respect and fear me as I sit atop my garbage throne.
142480	147600	But thanks for writing in buddy, remember if you want to write up something for your
147600	153120	wolf to have, tag at Pretending Pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on

198960	205040	This game is so wild y'all, normally the PCs would be cops, ex-special forces or informants

258380	259380	the past.
259380	266260	Well two things will always be true, one, shit is crazy fucked and two, Wolf has the
266260	270000	tunes to shake loose the foundations of reality.
270000	278020	So get ready, it's an oldie, it's timeless and perfect for a spineless crisis, it's Moondance
278020	282540	by Blue False Indigo.
282540	293980	She runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs, she runs,
293980	305420	the sun is leaving soon.
305420	320460	She knows, she knows, she knows, that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance
320460	325540	beneath the shadow of the moon.
325540	339500	No, is that not, they did it, it was a, it was a mash, they did a smash.
339500	344420	They did the mash, they did the monster mash, they did the mash, it was a graveyard smash.
344420	349820	They did the fuck, they did the monster fuck.
349820	359060	Wolf bar mitzvah, spooky scary, men becoming men, men becoming men, boys becoming wolf.
359060	362820	You're so bad at knowing how it works.
362820	366980	I'm bad at knowing how a lot of stuff works, it's October 1st guys, we're in the spooky
366980	367980	season.
367980	368980	Scary time.
368980	369980	It's our season to shine.
369980	370980	Hell yeah dude.
370980	374420	I think it's a perfect time to start a spooky woods story.
374420	379620	And if you're starting the podcast with this episode at any point in the future that's
379620	386420	not like the fall, I suggest you just stop and wait a year, just wait until it's the
386420	387780	spooky times.
387780	391380	You gotta know where we're coming from and you're just not gonna get it otherwise.
391380	396900	Also if you're starting the podcast now, go back and listen to him from episode one probably,
396900	398940	would be the best way to go about this.
398940	402420	That one's a little tricky because you have to start it in December 2018.
402420	403900	That's true.
403900	404900	That's true.
404900	405900	It'd be hard.
405900	406900	Can you time travel listener?
406900	407900	Hey listener.
407900	408900	If you can.
408900	410780	I appear in this room right now.
410780	411780	Ooh.
411780	412780	Oh my god.
412780	413780	Whoa.
413780	414780	Hey.
414780	415780	Hey.
415780	416780	You can't just come in here buddy.
416780	417780	Hello.
417780	418780	I am a time traveler.
418780	420580	Are you guys glad the podcast is over?
420580	424220	What time are you from?
424220	426380	Oh goodness.
426380	431820	So we're doing a new story set in the same universe.
431820	435300	When did I tell you guys to start working on characters for this?
435300	436300	Like three weeks ago.
436300	437300	Yeah.
437300	438300	Yeah.
438300	439300	Something like that.
439300	440300	Around there.
440300	441300	And...
441300	442300	And then we made them last night.
442300	443300	Yeah.
443300	444300	Yeah.
444300	445300	Pretty much.
445300	449720	When I told you guys to make characters, did you expect it to be in the same...
449720	450720	What did I tell you?
450720	451720	I told you to make High Schoolers.
451720	454220	You told us pretty much exactly what's about to happen.
454220	455440	High Schoolers in the Woods.
455440	456440	It's a prequel.
456440	457440	Oh yeah.
457440	458440	Prequel.
458440	464440	A while back you told us to prepare to make new characters, and I figured that our characters
464440	467200	would die and we would just come in, you know.
467200	468800	He figured our characters would die.
468800	469800	Yeah.
469800	474280	But we fucked up those plans in a very fun way.
474280	475400	I didn't expect to be...
475400	479340	Well, when you first brought it up, I didn't expect to be a High Schooler, but you know.
479340	480340	Here we are.
480340	481340	Here we are.
481340	486760	So for those listening, I have asked these boys to create High Schoolers to play a little
486760	489040	game in the woods.
489040	490820	That's where we're at for this one.
490820	492740	That's what Zach likes to do with his free time.
492740	494200	Play with High Schoolers in the Woods.
494200	496600	Take High School boys out for games in the woods.
496600	497600	Yeah, it's fun.
497600	499440	It's a good place to role play.
499440	500440	It's called orienteering.
500440	501440	I run a course.
501440	505600	How many times do I have to tell you, Thomas?
505600	506600	Fully licensed and accredited.
506600	510440	Yeah, go out to one of those team building things out in the woods.
510440	511440	Walk on a rope.
511440	513600	A lot of rope walking.
513600	514760	So much rope walking.
514760	515760	Get ready.
515760	518600	I hope you guys have rope walking as a skill.
518600	520200	I wrote it down as my craft.
520200	521200	On your character sheets.
521200	523120	I have 100% on rope walking.
523120	526240	So we sat down and made characters last week.
526240	532680	And just to give you guys, listeners, a parameter of what to expect here.
532680	539040	The whole last arc with the characters that we played, we did a Pulp Cthulhu mashup.
539040	542760	And on this one, we did not do that.
542760	549120	So for their characteristics, what are they called, stats, for the strength and constitution
549120	555540	and power and stuff, I gave them 60 points to put in, which would average out to 10 points
555540	557380	on each stat there.
557380	559640	Which means that they're weaker.
559640	560640	They're the worst characters.
560640	562040	Makes us a lot daintier.
562040	563040	Exactly.
563040	564040	And the hit points.
564040	567600	We're just helpless little teen boys, like Zach likes.
567600	568600	Exactly.
568600	570320	Out in the woods.
570320	575040	It's just because I want to teach young men how to become better men.
575040	577040	Probably die eventually.
577040	580440	I mean, everybody dies eventually.
580440	581440	Exactly.
581440	587480	But sooner, if I'm around and well, that hasn't been the case in the show so far, but it might
587480	589980	be coming up.
589980	596280	And then for the skills, I gave them 400 points to put into the different skills, which is
596280	600940	considerably less than even a Call of Cthulhu or Delta Green character.
600940	604880	He also put the parameter on there that we couldn't have any skill higher than 50, which
604880	607640	puts another layer of squishiness on us.
607640	608640	Yeah.
608640	609640	There's a bit of squish.
609640	611480	We're just helpless little boys.
611480	612480	Just out here in the woods.
612480	616880	Is that the only thing you wrote on your character sheet?
616880	619480	What does Zach want to do to us out here?
619480	621600	Torment, scare, kill.
621600	622600	Push the narrative along.
622600	623600	All right, we got it boys.
623600	624600	We got them.
624600	625600	We got them.
625920	626920	Yeah.
626920	627920	Come on in.
627920	628920	Hello.
628920	629920	No, Zach.
629920	633920	I am a time traveler.
633920	636920	From the FBI.
636920	640720	All right, well, this has been going on long enough.
640720	644920	Let's dive into the game.
644920	645920	Damn it.
645920	646920	Fuck.
646920	647920	Oh, did you not want to play tonight?
647920	649920	No, I just lost the game.
649920	650920	Oh.
650920	651920	Fuck.
651920	653920	It's been a while.
653920	654920	Yeah.
655240	657920	All right, diving right in.
657920	667240	We see a high school classroom and the round clock up on the wall, like all high school
667240	675000	clocks, the normal analog clock says 3 30 on it.
675000	683960	And on the whiteboard or chalkboard, regardless, is the word detention and sitting at the only
684000	689600	desk that is occupied in the room is a boy, a helpless boy.
689600	692560	Thomas, what does this boy look like?
692560	700200	Like Judd Nelson in the Breakfast Club, but really young, like 13, 14.
700200	703960	He even looked young for his age, but he's still trying to put on like pretty tough.
703960	704960	So what's he wearing?
704960	706940	Denim, cut off jacket.
706940	714980	He's got kind of raggedy, like pretty thin Western shirt on Wranglers jeans and some
714980	718940	kind of punky boots and a scowl.
718940	720620	What's he doing right now?
720620	722660	Sitting alone in detention.
722660	727920	He's got his arms crossed and he's just staring at the clock and kind of tapping his toes.
727920	732340	And even if there were other people in this room, like he's, he would be, he's giving
732340	735180	off a vibe like fuck off, I've got enough friends.
735180	738660	Mr. Pettymore, you know that you're supposed to be doing your schoolwork.
738660	741660	He rolls his eyes.
741660	744700	The teacher also rolls his eyes.
744700	751980	The teacher is wearing a sweater vest and some slacks and kind of like an oversized
751980	756300	shirt underneath the sweater vest that's poofing out from underneath it.
756300	762540	And he's got horn rim glasses and he is equally scowling at you.
762540	769620	Then there is a knock on the door and two more young boys come into the room.
769620	772480	What do these boys look like, Joe and Luke?
772480	778500	You see Ken Krenkelhoff walk in and he's wearing a letterman jacket, but he also is like 13
778500	779500	or 14.
779500	781940	So he wouldn't, shouldn't have one.
781940	786140	It happens to be one that was bought for him by his dad and told that he needed to wear
786140	789540	to visualize himself in the future.
789540	796580	But he's tall and very fit and he's got a great head of hair and he walks in with a
796580	799420	lot of, his head held high.
799420	802560	He's got a lot of self esteem behind him and he's got a swagger to his walk.
802560	804960	And the teacher greets you very warmly.
804960	806980	He's like, Oh Ken, what a surprise.
806980	810220	So good to see you come into my classroom on a day like this.
810220	811500	How you doing, sir?
811500	816460	Oh, I'm doing extremely, extremely much better now that, now that you're here.
816460	820380	And Oh my God, look who it is, Ash.
820380	822900	Oh, my two favorite students.
822900	828300	Jeremy Pennymore real quick, just gives both of them like a look and pulls out his denim
828300	831660	jacket so the teacher can't see, but he gives them a like jack off motion.
831660	832660	Like, okay.
832660	834780	Like, all right, jack offs.
834780	841140	Ash walks in, he is like average freshman high school height, like however tall that
841140	842980	is five something.
843060	848380	He's got like black hair, just kind of messily placed on his head.
848380	854020	He's got a white t-shirt on with kind of like a, like a sleeveless jacket vest kind of thing
854020	857180	that's buttoned up over his white t-shirt.
857180	861380	And it's a mix between like cheetah print and horn, horns, what is it?
861380	862380	Houndstooth.
862380	867740	Uh, but it's like cheetah print colored acid wash jeans and some like, uh, kind of like
867740	869980	scuffed up tennis shoes on.
869980	873980	And he walks in and he just kind of winks at the teacher and he looks and he sits down
873980	874980	at a desk.
874980	879240	Ash, I am, I am positive that you don't have detention today.
879240	881900	What are you boys doing in my classroom?
881900	883980	We saw that, uh, our buddy Jeremy was in here.
883980	885900	We thought we'd come keep him company.
885900	886900	Get back to work.
886900	887900	Sorry.
887900	888900	You were saying?
888900	893100	We just, uh, we had some work that we could get done and we just thought we'd do it down
893100	894480	here with Jeremy.
894480	895980	Just make sure you didn't feel alone down here.
895980	900780	Ken and I have a group project that, well, my parents don't really want people, uh, to
900780	904340	come over until they're at home and, uh, Ken's is too far to walk to.
904340	910500	So, uh, we figured we just hang out here until, until, uh, we got done with our, our stuff.
910500	915740	Well you know that here at Silas Cole K through 12, we don't necessarily appreciate people
915740	920960	joining in on detentions when they don't quite have detention, might give off the wrong idea
920960	922780	that it's something fun to do.
922780	926940	But you know, you, you two are allowed to do whatever you want.
926940	928660	You know that Jeremy, get back to work.
928660	931340	Well, hey, you want me to do my schoolwork, right?
931340	932340	Yes.
932340	933340	Fuck.
933340	934340	The only schoolwork I got is with these two.
934340	935340	Jeremy cursing.
935340	937540	Sorry, sir.
937540	944140	And he looks at the two of you and he's like, are you actually going to keep him in line?
944140	947460	He is in our class with the, this, this group project.
947460	948460	Okay.
948500	953820	Yeah, somebody responsible has to be in here and Ken, since you're here, that's fine.
953820	960020	I actually, I'm, I need to run down to the teacher's lounge real quick and okay, I'll,
960020	961740	I'll, I'll be, I'll be back shortly.
961740	963820	Yeah, we'll put it, we'll put our nose to the ground.
963820	965660	Jeremy, get back to work.
965660	966660	Yes sir.
966660	971420	And the, uh, the, the teacher leaves the room and closes the door behind him.
971420	975700	Jeremy flips him huge double birds as the door closes.
975700	977100	Your fingers like grow.
977100	978100	Yes.
978780	983260	Uh, and I knocked some stuff off his desk and I'm like, all right, let's get out of
983260	984260	here losers.
984260	985260	Jeremy, what'd you do this time?
985260	988060	Oh, you just know what, what's that guy's name?
988060	992900	Oh, my teacher's name is, uh, uh, Benji Krinklehoff.
992900	994460	Uh, no relation.
994460	998300	Oh, you know, there's so many Krinklehoff's in contention.
998300	999860	It's a common contention name.
999860	1001580	You know, old Benji just hates me.
1001580	1002580	He just has it out for me.
1002580	1003580	Oh yeah.
1003580	1007620	Plus I called him a fuck.
1007620	1015020	You hear from down the hallway, you all ready for the woods tonight?
1015020	1021420	I open up my like little sweater jacket thing and lining the inside is just a bunch of like
1021420	1022700	a water dynamite.
1022700	1023700	What's water dynamite?
1023700	1027100	The little red things that you can throw in water and they'll still explode under water.
1027100	1031700	Oh, they're kind of like M-80s, but they're like waterproof M-80s.
1031700	1036180	Oh, you guys were, we were, we were at, we were going to do that.
1036220	1037900	Uh, yeah, no, sure.
1037900	1038900	Of course.
1038900	1039900	Are you nervous?
1039900	1040900	What do you mean?
1040900	1041900	Yeah.
1041900	1042900	You scared old man.
1042900	1047300	I just, I thought maybe we were maybe skipping, but no, it's, it's cool, but let's do it.
1047300	1050580	Well, you might not want to see, we're going to go back to my house before we go to the
1050580	1056540	woods and I got some, I got something that I wouldn't even bring to school, that home
1056540	1059780	that explodes.
1059780	1065380	Is that a penis joke or no.
1065380	1068540	It's fireworks or maybe something more.
1068540	1074060	Uh, yeah, I mean, I'll have to talk to my mom and dad and you know, they've been riding
1074060	1078220	me lately, but it is our last hurrah for this year.
1078220	1082900	So, uh, my older brother said I could take his car out and we can drive all the way out
1082900	1083900	there.
1083900	1085740	He's going to be partying with his stupid girlfriend anyway.
1085740	1088780	That probably won't fly with my mom, but I'll meet you guys there for sure.
1088780	1091180	Well, you can just come over to my house.
1091180	1093180	You don't have to tell your mom.
1093180	1094820	I'm sorry guys.
1094820	1095820	You know how they are.
1095820	1098580	It's a sick 91 firebird.
1098580	1100740	It's practically brand new, dude.
1100740	1105780	Maybe next year I'll be able to ride it, but this year I've got to do what they say.
1105780	1106780	All right.
1106780	1107780	You're a fuck.
1107780	1108780	Just like Mr. Krinklehoff.
1108780	1109780	We'll see you out there.
1109780	1115160	Cursing as he comes back into the room and Mr. Krinklehoff looks at the stuff that was
1115160	1120420	on his desk that is now on the ground and he looks specifically at Jeremy Pettymore.
1120420	1122620	You shouldn't have left the window open, man.
1123340	1125580	Hey man, actually our school project, it's outside.
1125580	1128020	We got to go out in them woods and gather some sticks and stuff.
1128020	1129360	So I'll see you all around.
1129360	1135300	It's for our biology class with, uh, and then Ash, Ash can't think of a biology teacher
1135300	1137140	because he's not in biology this semester.
1137140	1139220	It's for biology, right Ken?
1139220	1140220	Right?
1140220	1142940	Biology, Mr. Krinklehoff.
1142940	1143940	That's what he was working on.
1143940	1144940	You trust Ken, right?
1144940	1145940	All right.
1145940	1148340	Well, Ken, if you, if you say so, that's, that's fine.
1148340	1152580	But sir, Jeremy, before you leave, you're going to be here with me tomorrow.
1152580	1153580	The two.
1153580	1154580	Okay.
1154580	1155580	I'll look forward to it.
1155580	1156580	Wait, no, tomorrow.
1156580	1157580	Saturday.
1157580	1158580	We have the, the big, uh, the big parade.
1158580	1159580	Yeah.
1159580	1160580	No, um, yeah.
1160580	1161580	Monday.
1161580	1162580	Okay.
1162580	1163580	Yeah.
1163580	1164580	Detention right here.
1164580	1165580	Whole time.
1165580	1166580	And you're going to work.
1166580	1167580	Don't think you're not going to work.
1167580	1168900	These two can't come in every single day and save you.
1168900	1171980	I mean, Ken's got sport practice, you know, that's true on Mondays.
1171980	1172980	That's when you do sport.
1172980	1173980	I wouldn't miss it.
1173980	1174980	You better not.
1174980	1177700	You are the best at the whole, the whole team.
1177700	1178700	Yeah.
1178700	1181660	And in the school, perhaps even in the state, you're one of the best.
1181660	1184820	I understand that a lot of people's hopes and dreams are pinned on me and it, uh, it's
1184820	1185820	never lost on me.
1185820	1190020	My dad said, you're the only reason that anyone would ever hear of contention.
1190020	1193380	Uh, once you're a senior bringing us to the game, the big game.
1193380	1195620	My dad always says, I'm going to put the family on the map.
1195620	1196620	That's for sure.
1196620	1197620	The whole town's counting on you.
1197620	1198620	The Krinklehoff name.
1198620	1205700	I, I know Ken that we're not technically blood related, but, uh, it would be really nice
1205700	1208120	to have our name shining in lights.
1208120	1209120	That's right.
1210120	1211120	That's right.
1211120	1213720	Benji you married into the Krinklehoff family and took your wife's last name, right?
1213720	1214720	Yeah.
1214720	1215720	And this is the nineties.
1215720	1218720	So that's emasculating and strange.
1218720	1219720	Just like you.
1219720	1220720	Let's go boys.
1220720	1222720	I think, well, what are you guys doing tonight?
1222720	1226720	We're already out the door.
1226720	1228440	Yep.
1228440	1234800	And uh, as you guys are walking down the hallway, let's get a sense of, I'm sorry that even
1234800	1239920	though we're acting, uh, I felt real animosity towards an authority figure.
1239920	1248440	Like it's just our natural relationship.
1248440	1252520	As you guys are walking down the hall, I think we've gotten a decent sense of who your characters
1252520	1256520	are, but how do you walk down the high school hallway, each of you?
1256520	1257520	I'm curious.
1257520	1261640	Uh, I'm probably kind of leading the way up toward the front, maybe even a little further
1261640	1264720	ahead than it would be to look like I was with these people.
1264720	1268120	I've got a lighter, the lighter that I'm gonna use for fireworks later in my hand and I'm
1268120	1272920	just running it down the lockers to make like a clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, sound.
1272920	1276960	I'm just on my smartphone.
1276960	1278600	I like that.
1278600	1285500	It's the only thing that, my only rule is no smartphones.
1285500	1286500	It's a school.
1286500	1288080	It is 1994, right?
1288080	1289080	Doesn't matter.
1290080	1293280	25 years later, 25 years earlier.
1293280	1294280	Yeah.
1294280	1295280	Okay.
1295280	1296280	Time.
1296280	1297280	I don't care for it.
1297280	1298280	Yeah.
1298280	1302640	That's why I decided to, on our very first podcast venture, run a role playing game based
1302640	1305200	around time travel.
1305200	1306680	Like a fucking idiot.
1306680	1307680	Wait.
1307680	1308680	What?
1308680	1309680	Yeah.
1309680	1311120	That's fair.
1311160	1320720	So, as you guys are walking down the hallway, you see one of the upperclassmen, oh hey guys,
1320720	1324760	looking in his locker, putting his books up and stuff and he's like, what are you guys
1324760	1325760	up to tonight?
1325760	1328600	I mean, come on man, tonight's the night we go out in the woods.
1328600	1329600	You know how we boys do.
1329600	1330600	Oh yeah.
1330600	1332000	I forgot that's your guys' thing, right?
1332000	1333880	You guys go look for Madge or whatever?
1333880	1334880	Yeah.
1334880	1335880	That's our thing.
1335880	1336880	It's out of the three of us.
1336880	1337880	That's our thing.
1337880	1338880	It's certainly a thing that we've-
1338880	1339880	That's our thing.
1339880	1340880	We've done.
1341640	1346560	It's kept us together over all the years we kind of became different people, kind of started
1346560	1351080	hanging out with the little different groups, but it's the one thing that keeps us tied
1351080	1352080	together like glue.
1352080	1354200	Well, are you guys going to find her this year or what?
1354200	1355200	Yeah, man.
1355200	1356200	I mean, that's always been the idea.
1356200	1357200	I mean, that's the goal.
1357200	1358200	We're going to find her.
1358200	1359200	What are you doing tonight?
1359200	1360200	Yeah.
1360200	1361200	Yeah.
1361200	1362200	We'll find her.
1362200	1370800	Oh, I'm just going over to like, probably like the, you know, the, um, you know.
1371720	1372720	Hey man.
1372720	1373720	We'll have fun doing that.
1373720	1374720	Are you on weed?
1374720	1375720	Yeah.
1375720	1376720	Don't tell anybody.
1376720	1377720	Hey.
1377720	1378720	That's not cool, man.
1378720	1388600	Dare to resist drugs, alcohol, violence, resist drugs, alcohol, resistance, education.
1388600	1389600	Yep.
1389600	1390600	Yeah, sure.
1390600	1391600	There we go.
1391600	1395600	Yeah, it works, man.
1395600	1396600	It's real.
1396600	1401160	Brother, uh, as I said, if I ran into you to tell you that he's out and, uh, to get
1401160	1402160	ahold of him.
1402160	1403160	That's cool.
1403160	1404160	I could use some.
1404160	1407360	Oh, do you guys want, how should I, am I supposed to sell weed to freshmen?
1407360	1409680	I'm, I, I'm, I'm good for now.
1409680	1413880	Ken, Ken is suddenly pretending to like not be involved in the conversation.
1413880	1417800	He's kind of like turned around and just maybe like kicking the locker across the hall.
1417800	1418800	Hey Ken.
1418800	1419800	Ash, Ash.
1419800	1422840	Dude, we got to be on our toes tonight.
1422840	1426120	He's kind of waving and walking down the hall a little further now.
1426120	1427120	It's true.
1427120	1428120	We gotta, we gotta be.
1428120	1429120	Okay.
1429120	1430320	Well, Cleve Moore, we gotta, we gotta get on our way.
1430320	1431320	I'll see you later.
1431320	1432320	Yes.
1432320	1433320	All right.
1433320	1434320	Goodbye, Eduardo.
1434320	1435320	You know, I prefer it when you call me Eduardo.
1435320	1437880	It's well, it's the name I've chosen.
1437880	1438880	Yeah.
1438880	1440840	I just like to call people by their last names sometimes.
1440840	1441840	All right.
1441840	1444480	Well, it's rude, but I like you anyway.
1444480	1445480	Okay.
1445480	1446480	Bye Eduardo.
1446480	1447480	Thank you.
1447480	1448480	That guy's exhausting.
1448480	1450640	It's like talking to a fucking turtle.
1450640	1452640	It's like talking to Eeyore.
1452640	1453640	I would, I don't know.
1453640	1457560	That guy gets high every day and I personally as Jeremy Pettimore can not relate to that.
1457560	1461200	And we skip on down the hallway.
1461200	1466720	Ash and I arm in arm and we're like, what are, we're like reaching out for Ken.
1466720	1467720	What is the contention?
1467720	1468720	Ken, skip with us.
1468720	1470400	What is the contention high school mascot?
1470400	1472120	Ooh, uh, the octopi.
1472120	1473600	Did we ever, was it, is that cannon?
1473600	1474600	I think it's something weird.
1474600	1476120	I doubt you said it.
1476120	1477120	Octopus isn't bad.
1477120	1481040	It's a Silas Cole K through 12 is the name of the school.
1481440	1484440	And what was his industry besides orphans?
1484440	1485600	It could be miners.
1485600	1486600	The miners.
1486600	1487600	100% the miners.
1487600	1488600	Yeah.
1488600	1489600	We know how much Zach likes that.
1489600	1490600	The 40 miners.
1490600	1491600	Stop making that joke.
1491600	1492600	You're not.
1492600	1493600	Oh, thank you.
1493600	1498180	I didn't even get it because that's not how my mind works.
1498180	1500240	Your head was swirling with lore.
1500240	1501240	That's exactly right.
1501240	1504440	I was like, I do like mines.
1504440	1507440	Lore is the name of a young boy he's had his eye on.
1507880	1511880	It's short for Lauren, spelled like the boy name.
1511880	1512880	Okay.
1512880	1513880	All right.
1513880	1514880	Well.
1514880	1515880	Yeah.
1515880	1521040	On the way out, the mascot is a guy with one of those hard hats on with the light and he's
1521040	1524860	got the pickaxe in one hand and he's holding out his other and I jump up and I smack his
1524860	1526200	hand to give him a high five.
1526200	1529080	Except it's a huge, like it's a giant mascot head.
1529080	1530560	Oh, that's fun.
1530560	1531680	Like one of the cows.
1531680	1536960	Like it's an oversized head mascot head of a minor dude and he's just like, he's got
1536960	1538380	a little like foam hand.
1538380	1542800	It's important that the head is massive with a giant minor head on it.
1542800	1543800	Yeah.
1543800	1544800	That's very fun.
1544800	1545800	Yeah.
1545800	1549240	I jump up and give him a little high five for good luck for the team, for Ken and for
1549240	1550360	tonight.
1550360	1551360	He topples over.
1551360	1555640	He's just too top heavy and you guys head off.
1566960	1573760	All right, Luke, Ash Hornbeam, horn beam.
1573760	1574760	What is it?
1574760	1575760	Horn beam.
1575760	1576760	Horn beam.
1576760	1577760	That's fun.
1577760	1580040	H O R N B E A M. Horn beam.
1580040	1582440	And Thomas, your character is Jeremy Pettymore.
1582440	1585720	I believe we already know how to spell that.
1585720	1587280	A lot of people don't.
1587280	1588280	Ash you.
1588280	1589280	It's not with a Y.
1589280	1590280	It's with an I.
1590280	1594880	Ash, you mentioned that you have a car for the evening, I believe.
1594880	1595880	I do.
1595880	1597880	It's my older brother's car.
1597880	1603360	I think I said a 91 Firebird, which is an ugly car.
1603360	1604360	What color is it?
1604360	1609040	That weird like gold color from the 90s.
1609040	1610480	Very cool.
1610480	1616360	So as you guys are making your way out to the woods of contention for this evening,
1616360	1620560	you're driving in this 91 Firebird.
1620560	1623320	Luke, how fast do you drive in?
1623320	1624320	How fast is Ash driving?
1624320	1626560	Am I on a main road or the dirt road?
1626560	1627560	It's a main road.
1627560	1629560	It's like a country road probably, yeah.
1629560	1630560	Two lane.
1630560	1631560	Okay.
1631560	1632560	I'm going the speed.
1632560	1637800	I'm going like probably 10 over till we get to the dirt road and then just pedal to the
1637800	1638800	metal.
1638800	1639800	All right.
1639800	1645780	So as soon as you turn on the dirt road to the contention woods, you put the pedal to
1645780	1646780	the metal.
1646780	1651800	I just fishtail into the dirt road and just dust is flying out.
1651800	1655440	I reach over and turn the tape deck up and Copperhead Road is blessed.
1655440	1657960	Oh, hell yeah.
1657960	1660580	Go ahead and roll a drive check for me.
1660580	1663440	When he does that, I'm like, dude, don't bust the speakers.
1663440	1664560	And then I look at him and laugh.
1664560	1666120	I'm like, it's my brother's car.
1666120	1671640	And as you laugh, you look back at the road and you see a squirrel has run out directly
1671640	1673440	in your wheels path.
1673440	1676480	I rolled a 44 on a 50.
1676480	1678400	Oh, okay.
1678400	1682400	My brother lets me drive his car a lot.
1682400	1688560	And you are very good at fishtailing and whipping the back end of this Firebird around.
1688560	1690840	And as soon as you see it, you...
1690840	1693620	So I'm still fishtailing and I see it.
1693620	1698680	So I kind of turn the wheel to where the car kind of like goes sideways on the road, goes
1698680	1700440	underneath the car.
1700440	1705560	I like start driving backwards and flip it around and basically do a 360 and keep going
1705560	1706560	straight.
1706720	1714240	The squirrel looks at you with these massive cartoonish eyes before it dips off into the
1714240	1715240	woods.
1715240	1717480	When it's staring at me, I do a finger gun and wink.
1717480	1721880	Jeremy's like, what the hell, man, are you trying to get me killed over a squirrel?
1721880	1724400	Hey man, they're people too.
1724400	1725400	And you guys pull in...
1725400	1727180	It's gotta be popular to everybody, huh?
1727180	1728960	You know, it works.
1728960	1732920	It actually works out really well that you rolled a crit success on your first roll as
1732920	1733920	Ash Hornbeam.
1733920	1736480	Bean, I keep fucking this up.
1736480	1737480	Hornbeam.
1737480	1738480	Hornbeam.
1738480	1740360	I want to say bean.
1740360	1741360	Hornbeam.
1741360	1746480	Fucking weird offshoot of the beans.
1746480	1747480	Yeah, exactly.
1747480	1748480	Yes.
1748480	1753520	Well, we don't really speak with the Hornbeam cousins, but...
1753520	1758640	So you guys pull into this parking lot, it's a gravel parking lot for the contention woods.
1758640	1765160	And there are two cars in the parking lot currently, one of which has a notice that
1765160	1772520	is taped up on the driver's side window and the other has a boot on the back left wheel.
1772520	1774820	What does the notice say on the car?
1774820	1781920	Move your car or we'll put a boot on it.
1781920	1789320	And you guys see that there is a little shack at the entrance, which you know is typically
1789320	1794320	unoccupied and it is like the entrance to the woods.
1794320	1796160	So it's where the trailhead is.
1796160	1798760	Is it like a park ranger shack thing?
1798760	1799760	Exactly.
1799760	1808600	Also, there in the parking lot right next to it, next to this little shack, is a SUV,
1808600	1814240	like a Bronco, let's go with a Ford Bronco, that has got a lift kit on it.
1814240	1819140	I want to reach back into the back seat, or like into the console of the car, get out
1819140	1826400	a little piece of paper, write, please don't boot my car, ash horn beam, and put it underneath
1826400	1827400	the windshield wiper.
1827400	1831620	That's going to be crazy when they find our bodies.
1831620	1832900	You said like a Bronco though?
1832900	1833900	Yeah.
1833900	1835260	Is there any notice or boot on that?
1835260	1836260	No.
1836260	1837260	So fresh.
1837260	1838740	Does it look like the ranger's car?
1838740	1839740	It does.
1839740	1840740	Okay.
1840740	1850340	To just in general shitheadery and hooliganism and anger at my dad, I want to see if those
1850340	1851340	cars are unlocked.
1851340	1852340	Absolutely.
1852340	1853640	Do some petty theft from them.
1853640	1858800	You guys were extremely mature police officers, so I'm sure making you a freshman in high
1858800	1860500	school won't-
1860500	1866800	My new eyes specifically was like, yeah, this guy's got a huge chip on his shoulder.
1866800	1868040	Is it visible?
1868040	1870540	Seems like it might be visible.
1870540	1876100	And go ahead and roll a search check first.
1876100	1880900	Ooh, critical success, 11.
1880900	1890300	They are both unlocked, and in the first one you find almost nothing that has been cleaned
1890300	1892300	out perhaps previously by someone else.
1892300	1896060	Is there any like identifiable, like can we find out who the car belongs to?
1896060	1902780	It's so clean inside that it looks like someone came in and took everything out of it already.
1902780	1903780	That's kind of weird.
1903780	1904780	That is kind of weird.
1904780	1914900	And the other one you find a bunch of camping equipment, and there is in the console a title
1914900	1922380	for the vehicle that belongs to one Stuart Feldman.
1922380	1923380	Do we know who that is?
1923380	1924380	No.
1924380	1926660	Is it registered in contention, or somewhere else?
1926660	1928980	It is registered in the city.
1928980	1932260	We didn't bring any camping stuff, should we just take that?
1932260	1933660	We can return it later.
1933660	1937900	Yeah, Stuart hasn't been around in a while, so it's a real nice tent.
1937900	1940340	It's the one with the notice on it.
1940340	1941340	What do you think?
1941340	1942340	We can always just bring it back.
1942340	1943340	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
1943340	1944340	I like that idea.
1944340	1946720	Do we find any liquor or anything?
1946720	1950220	You find liquor and a pistol with ammunition.
1950220	1951220	Oh shit.
1951220	1953220	Oh fuck, dude.
1953220	1954580	That's a badass piece.
1954580	1962940	Ash gets kind of nervous, but I have all those fireworks in my jacket, and then I found a
1962940	1966700	stick of dynamite at my grandpa's house, so I brought that with me.
1966700	1970100	Well, okay, we're gonna shoot the stick of dynamite later.
1970100	1971220	I don't want to touch the gun.
1971220	1973460	I checked the gun to see if it's loaded.
1973460	1974460	It is loaded.
1974460	1975940	Holy crap, this is awesome.
1975940	1978460	I'm gonna grab the tent and a sleeping bag.
1978460	1979460	Sure.
1979460	1982260	Can I peek into the shack to see if the ranger's in there?
1982300	1989300	Yeah, and as you walk up to it and peek in, you do see there is an elderly man sitting
1989300	1990740	on a stool.
1990740	1996900	It's got one of those open-air windows that he would greet you from, basically, and he
1996900	1999660	was asleep until you walked up.
1999660	2000660	Fuck.
2000660	2001660	And this is the ranger?
2001660	2003780	This is the ranger, but as soon as you poke your head in-
2003780	2006580	He's got a sweet fucking ride for such an old man.
2006580	2007580	I know.
2007580	2008580	He kind of-
2008580	2010580	Hello there.
2010900	2017060	Hi, young boys, what are you doing tonight in these woods of contention?
2017060	2020020	Well, hey Jeb, we're here for our yearly camping trip.
2020020	2028420	So you misread the situation because this is not the normal for a stranger of contention,
2028420	2033780	and you see that he's actually wearing a uniform that is issued by the state, and he says,
2033780	2042660	Well, it says right here, Woodrow, you can call me Buzz, as that is my nickname, and-
2042660	2044260	Wait, didn't you just say his name was Jeb?
2044260	2045260	No, you did.
2045260	2048860	I know, but that was- I didn't make that up, did I?
2048860	2049860	I think so.
2049860	2050860	I think you did.
2050860	2051860	I thought I heard it.
2051860	2053580	You're just so good at improv that you just-
2053580	2057700	Well, and you're so bad at it.
2057700	2060620	And looking around, you see that he's got a cane.
2060620	2062020	You've misread the situation.
2062020	2063460	You've misread the situation, sir.
2063460	2065140	No, but-
2065140	2071460	I've already written down this man's name, and he's got a cane next to him, and you would
2071460	2076660	see looking around the little shack, there are clipboards all hanging on the wall and
2076660	2084180	at this desk, and there are fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer,
2084180	2087780	and a first aid kit, and a bunch of other stuff like that.
2087780	2094780	And you do see there is a board behind him with pictures and pieces of paper thumbtacked
2094780	2100340	into the board, like a bulletin board kind of thing, and he says, I'm going to need to
2100340	2107420	take down some of your information, as you know, all these people been going missing
2107420	2113300	around here in contention, so we just need to make sure that we have all of the information
2113300	2119620	necessary for any people who are coming into the woods, that way we have the information.
2119620	2121300	Oh, sorry, I didn't hear you there.
2121300	2125060	Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking them to the past?
2125060	2126500	Not even a little bit, son.
2126500	2127500	Are you high right now?
2127500	2129220	No, I was just fucking around with you.
2129220	2130900	Hey, what happened to Jeb, the normal guy?
2130900	2134940	Well, and he points back at the board, and there's a picture of Jeb.
2134940	2141140	It's a Polaroid, and there's a piece of paper behind each Polaroid, and he says, we're going
2141140	2147140	to need to take a couple pictures of you both and get some information as well, son,
2147140	2148140	what's your name?
2148140	2151660	And he holds a Polaroid up to you and snaps a picture.
2151660	2157300	It's a picture of me blinking in the flash, and then I'm like, Jeremy Pettymore?
2157300	2162860	Jeremy Pettymore, and what is your business in the woods this evening?
2162860	2164700	We're just going camping.
2164700	2166060	Okay.
2166060	2171580	Did you bring along anything with you aside from normal camping gear?
2171580	2176540	Just a keen sense of imagination and wonder and hope for the world and the future, despite
2176540	2181700	the circumstances I come from personally in my broken home, I still got a lot, I think,
2181700	2182700	to live for.
2182700	2185500	That is very nice to hear.
2185500	2186500	I like that.
2186500	2188100	I like you.
2188100	2194340	And he writes all that information down, and then he looks up and he says, one last question.
2194340	2200740	If you were to be scared and run away in some place, where might we find you if you
2200740	2201900	were hiding?
2201900	2203380	Probably the old caves.
2203380	2205140	Probably the old caves indeed.
2205140	2209900	And then he looks over at Ash and he says, oh, I like the jib of your cut, and he takes
2209900	2210900	a picture of you.
2210900	2214260	And it's me smiling, giving thumbs up.
2214260	2216580	And it is an extremely good picture.
2216580	2219180	You might be the most photogenic person in contention.
2219180	2221340	He says, what's your name there, sonny?
2221340	2222340	Hornbeam.
2222340	2223340	Ash Hornbeam.
2223340	2224340	Ash, Hornbeam.
2224340	2226340	All righty.
2226340	2229580	And what are you up to tonight in the woods?
2229580	2235220	Well, we take this trip every year, probably meeting a friend down there, probably going
2235220	2240300	to come down later, but me and this guy and another buddy, every year we come down here
2240300	2243060	and we, you know, just boys' night in the woods.
2243060	2244180	Yes, sir.
2244180	2245900	We've done it four years running.
2245900	2246940	Four years running.
2246940	2249140	You must be very close friends.
2249140	2250300	Oh, yeah.
2250300	2251420	The closest.
2251420	2255980	And did you bring anything with you this evening, Mr. Hornbeam?
2255980	2258540	That is not traditional camping equipment.
2258540	2261740	Just the tent and this sleeping bag.
2261740	2264060	But I see there's a first aid kit in there.
2264060	2265060	Could we borrow that?
2265060	2266940	Yeah, well, of course you can.
2266940	2272580	I normally like to keep it here with me for people who may need it later.
2272580	2274180	They come here looking for it.
2274180	2278700	It's like if your kid goes missing in the grocery store, you don't want them to go looking
2278700	2279780	about for you.
2279780	2283100	You want them to stay as close to you as possible.
2283100	2290860	I remember one time my grandchild Poppy, he went missing in the grocery store and we never
2290860	2291860	found him.
2291860	2295300	Did you ever consider that a goo monster was taking him back to the past?
2295300	2299540	You have a funny sensibility about you and I enjoy it thoroughly.
2299540	2304780	Well, sometimes your first aid kit grows up and you just got to let it go on its own.
2305380	2307380	Same with the...
2307380	2310380	Sometimes our normal campsite's a little overgrown.
2310380	2315020	What about maybe, could we have one of those machetes to maybe cut down brush and whatnot?
2315020	2320420	Well, you're going to need to roll a persuade check to get one of those.
2320420	2321860	They're in alphabetical order.
2321860	2324860	I know.
2324860	2326660	That only helps if you can read.
2326660	2328700	That's a fail.
2329100	2336700	Well, you know, Sonny, I like to keep this one here just in case if there's any grass
2336700	2338940	that grows too quick around here.
2338940	2339940	You know what I mean?
2339940	2340940	I know what you mean.
2340940	2344300	Unlike the first aid kit, you're going to keep it because you're not entirely bad at
2344300	2345300	your job.
2345300	2346300	Exactly.
2346300	2352340	I figure when all goes to chaos and we're desperately hunting, searching for our lives,
2352340	2353700	if that were to happen.
2353700	2354700	I hope not.
2354700	2358860	You know, I figure we can just loot this place silly once all goes to hell and we find this
2358860	2360460	guy with his head ripped off or something.
2360460	2361460	I doubt it.
2361460	2368060	And I was like, very strong and I've got my head on my shoulders tight.
2368060	2374580	My mom always said that if my head wasn't attached to my shoulders, I wouldn't be alive.
2374580	2375740	What else does your mama say?
2375740	2377460	Does she ever tell you anything else?
2377460	2382940	Yeah, she once told me that if you've got two birds, then why are you looking in bushes?
2382940	2383940	Why don't you tell me some more?
2383940	2387780	And as he does, I want to kind of like sneak around and try to maybe steal some of that
2387780	2388780	shit.
2388780	2392580	In order to help him, I want to pull a slingshot out, light one of my fireworks and kind of
2392580	2396420	fling it out past to create a distraction.
2396420	2400660	That is some good old fashioned like childhood shenanigans.
2400660	2403780	I would like you both to roll stealth for me.
2403780	2405540	Can I roll pranks for mine?
2405540	2406540	Okay.
2406540	2407540	So Luke.
2407540	2408540	Yeah.
2408540	2409540	Dude, yes.
2409860	2412980	Luke made a skill under craft, right?
2412980	2413980	Yeah.
2413980	2414980	Yeah.
2414980	2416100	And you can craft pranks.
2416100	2418140	So that I'm crafting a prank right now.
2418140	2419140	Okay.
2419140	2424500	So first off, you're going to roll the prank first and if you succeed, then it'll give
2424500	2428500	Thomas a boost to his stealth roll.
2428500	2430680	That is a 46 on a 50.
2430680	2433720	I would also like to use criminology instead of stealth.
2433720	2434720	You absolutely can.
2434720	2441040	As a petty more child, like my mom and dad are just addicts and I come from a bad home,
2441040	2446480	but the uncles that I've been fostered out to occasionally are all quite criminal and
2446480	2448640	they're the only people I have to look up to.
2448640	2449880	All right.
2449880	2451480	So I've kind of thing or two.
2451480	2455900	Well, I'll give you a plus 40 on your criminology check here.
2455900	2459720	That would, that takes me up to a 70 and I roll a four.
2459720	2460720	Congratulations.
2460720	2462120	Do you guys want to describe what happened?
2462120	2463120	What all was in here again?
2463120	2464800	A lot of clipboards.
2464800	2467800	We've got the bulletin board with the pictures and the information.
2467800	2474880	We've got fire extinguishers, axes, machetes, flashlights, hand sanitizer, and a first aid
2474880	2477720	kit that is already in Ash's hands.
2477720	2482520	I have stuffed that into the sleeping bag, which I will make into a regular bag until
2482520	2483520	I sleep in it.
2483520	2486080	I would like to focus on the clipboards.
2486080	2487080	I'm kidding.
2487080	2491880	I'm going to grab a fire extinguisher and then a machete for everybody.
2491880	2493020	Does he leave?
2493020	2497260	Does he go check out the relatively big pop in the sky behind the shack?
2497260	2498260	Yeah.
2498260	2504020	So there's a, uh, you pull out a slingshot and an M80 and I light the fuse and I sneak
2504020	2510580	out of the view of the little window and like fired up probably 20 feet past the shack.
2510580	2512420	So he has to leave to go check it out.
2512420	2515380	He goes, Oh my goodness.
2515380	2519740	And you hear it and he's like, Oh, Oh no.
2519740	2524340	I, I, Oh, I'm going to be right back boys.
2524340	2525980	I need to take care of something.
2525980	2531380	And he stands up and uses his cane to walk out of this little shack and he heads over
2531380	2535640	to the restrooms that are attached to the shack.
2535640	2539660	So over the little counter, like through the window where you, where he would talk to people,
2539660	2545200	you just see like machetes and the fire extinguisher and flashlights all just like being cartoonishly
2545200	2546420	tossed out to Keith.
2546420	2548900	And I just catch them all in my sleeping bag.
2548900	2549900	Perfect.
2549900	2550900	Keith.
2550900	2551900	Uh, ash.
2551900	2552900	Ash.
2552900	2553900	Ash.
2553900	2554900	That's going to be fun.
2554900	2555900	So did we pretty much get everything?
2555900	2558580	Maybe one fire extinguisher just in case two of everything.
2558580	2563260	Two machetes, two axes, a fire extinguisher, three flashlights if we can get them.
2563260	2564260	Yeah, for sure.
2564260	2567180	Uh, and then hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer.
2567180	2568820	And then I kind of want to take a look at the board.
2568820	2574740	So looking at the board, you see lots of different types of people from contention.
2574740	2579980	We recognize many of them because this is an extremely small town and you would know
2579980	2588420	that a lot of people have been going missing over the past month and the contention police
2588420	2593340	force is seemingly doing very little about it.
2593340	2595180	They're not even really talking about it.
2595180	2599100	Well they just assume it's contention realm spring where everybody goes out to the city
2599100	2604300	for six months and you know, lives a sinful liberal life.
2604300	2606220	Yeah, exactly.
2606220	2607220	Learns about the world.
2607220	2609060	So how many people are missing?
2609060	2610060	18.
2610060	2611060	Holy shit.
2611060	2613580	Is there anybody I don't recognize or anybody who really stands out?
2613580	2619380	Yeah, there is a, there's one guy who is named Stuart.
2619380	2620540	What did I call that guy?
2620540	2621780	Stuart Feldman.
2621780	2632420	Stuart Feldman is a bald guy with an extremely thick jaw line and he seems to be upper middle
2632420	2639980	aged but in incredible shape and looking at his information, he said that he was out
2639980	2646500	in the woods on business and he is a Brit.
2646500	2647500	It is noted.
2647500	2651140	This is kind of, this is kind of weird here, Ash, right here looking for madge.
2651140	2656340	I think we might've stumbled on some, some kind of a young adult coming of age bonding
2656340	2657340	mystery.
2657340	2658340	I agree.
2658340	2661020	What's a, what's a British guy doing in contention?
2661020	2662700	I don't even know what that is.
2662700	2668460	I that's because you are always in detention and not doing your homework.
2668460	2672660	Hey, you know, but Hey, I didn't know enough about geography than I can point it out on
2672660	2673660	a map.
2673660	2674820	I can't tell you why he's here though.
2674820	2677900	That's like a three or four hour drive from England.
2677900	2678900	Here's a little map.
2678900	2680460	Here's a globe sitting on his desk.
2680460	2681760	Could you point to that?
2681760	2684340	And I point to Ireland.
2684340	2686640	That's pretty close.
2686640	2690140	If you were playing Keith, that would have been like an absolute win.
2690140	2691140	Yeah.
2691140	2695660	Uh, and then the last, the last thing I want to look for, um, are the keys to the Bronco.
2695660	2696660	Okay.
2696660	2697860	Do I see those in here anywhere?
2697860	2701940	Uh, roll another search check for me there.
2701940	2704620	17 on a 50.
2704620	2705620	You do.
2705620	2711460	You see the keys to the Bronco and they are attached to the keys for this shack seemingly.
2711460	2713460	I'm going to go ahead and pocket all of those.
2713460	2714460	Are there any more keys?
2714460	2715460	Nope.
2715460	2716460	Okay.
2716460	2720340	I'm a little, uh, kind of like nervous, but I don't say anything about it.
2720340	2721340	Hey, come on man.
2721340	2722340	It's a role playing game.
2722340	2723980	It's just, that's what I'm doing.
2723980	2726980	We just thieve in stealth.
2726980	2735400	The door opens to the bathroom and you guys hide all of your stolen items and buzz comes
2735400	2737100	back and he says, yeah.
2737100	2739260	And one more question there.
2739260	2744700	If you were to go missing and running off somewhere, where would you be hiding?
2744700	2745700	Ash?
2745940	2747540	I'd be with, uh, with my friends.
2747540	2748860	So I assumed the caves.
2748860	2749860	Yeah.
2749860	2752620	I mean, that's where we, that's where he said he'd be.
2752620	2754260	That's where I'd go hiding.
2754260	2755260	All right.
2755260	2760340	And I'm not too familiar with these caves, but they are, where are they?
2760340	2765020	They're in the far west of, yeah, in the, in the, in the northwest corner of the park
2765020	2766020	on the globe.
2766020	2768020	I point to contention.
2768020	2769340	I'm like, they're right here.
2769340	2770340	I hit there.
2770340	2771340	Yeah.
2771340	2772340	See?
2772340	2773340	Okay.
2773340	2774340	All right.
2774660	2775660	You're learning.
2775660	2776660	Yeah.
2776660	2781940	He writes it all down and then he sticks your guys's pictures up on the board along with
2781940	2784340	the information behind them.
2784340	2786700	And he says, all right there.
2786700	2793940	Well, welcome once again to these here fine woods of contention and be safe out there.
2793940	2798740	If you find any one of these people and he like points at all the people whose pictures
2798740	2803280	are now around your picture, you know, let us know.
2803280	2807280	Can you take a, can you take a picture of those pictures and give it to us?
2807280	2809480	So we might have a reference.
2809480	2814400	I can absolutely spare one, a single Polaroid, a single Polaroid.
2814400	2822320	I'll just have tiny little pictures we can't fucking see on it.
2822320	2824240	I got, I got, we got young eyes.
2824240	2825240	Is it yet?
2825240	2826240	Is that Stu?
2826240	2827240	I think so.
2827240	2832000	Hey, sometimes I'm doing real good about pretending to be a child and sometimes I'm out, but that's
2832000	2839760	cause I'm going through puberty and you guys head off to your normal camping spot.
2839760	2840760	I would assume.
2840760	2845920	Is it like a drivable trail down to there or is it walking on like, it's so we know
2845920	2851960	that it is a trail that can handle a four wheeler and it is technically wide enough
2851960	2857000	to handle a vehicle as well, but it's not, you're not supposed to, yeah, we'll leave
2857000	2858000	the car here.
2858000	2859000	Right.
2859000	2860000	What do you think Jeremy?
2860000	2861000	Oh yeah.
2861000	2862920	We already stole all this shit.
2862920	2868000	We don't want to like attract more attention by just driving over the, the parking barrier.
2868000	2870600	My brother would kill me if we fucked up his beautiful car.
2870600	2872560	Your brother's going to kill you one of these days anyway.
2872560	2873560	He's a fucking maniac.
2873560	2874560	I know.
2874560	2877160	But uh, well he lets me borrow his car, so yeah, he's pretty cool.
2877160	2878160	For now.
2878160	2883720	Uh, Hey also look, look, look at what we got from, from the car and I, I waved the little
2883720	2884720	liquor flask.
2884720	2886480	You know what I'm saying?
2886480	2887480	Yeah.
2887480	2888560	I flashed the flask at him.
2888560	2890040	It's a massive flask.
2890080	2891560	It holds like half a fifth.
2891560	2898680	Oh, I look at him and I look at him and I kind of smile and I'm like, well, and out
2898680	2905400	of my back pocket, I pull out a great mad dog 2020 and I'm like, I'm like, we're prepared.
2905400	2907040	Is tonight the night we become men?
2907040	2908040	I think so.
2908040	2909040	I think it is.
2920040	2931440	So as Ash and Jeremy are heading down the trail, who's got a better survival skill between
2931440	2932440	the two of you?
2932440	2933440	I have a 30.
2933440	2934440	Fuck.
2934440	2940040	I thought we were still playing shit back and I was like, I've never heard this at all.
2940040	2943160	It's like, this is insane.
2943160	2947920	The look on your face when you, your eyes were like bugging out of your head.
2947920	2948920	Legit.
2949000	2951000	Why does he look like that?
2953560	2957560	He repeated the same words for the start of it and I was like, okay, we're listening back.
2957560	2958560	Shit.
2958560	2959560	Okay.
2961560	2962560	That was spooky.
2962560	2964560	I've got a 50.
2964560	2968560	Okay, Thomas, go ahead and roll a survival check for me.
2968560	2969560	19.
2969560	2970560	Congratulations.
2970560	2976680	You notice as you're walking out there, you've been in these woods a fair amount of times
2977440	2986920	and you see that there are tracks on this trail and you are pretty positive.
2986920	2993000	It looks like a car, some sort of vehicle and a smaller vehicle like a four wheeler
2993000	2996120	have both driven down this trail.
2996120	2997360	Here's something weird, man.
2997360	3002720	Looks like both a car or some kind of large vehicle and a four wheeler both driven down
3002720	3003720	here recently.
3003760	3005960	When I look down, I'm like, oh yeah, I see it too.
3005960	3008440	Damn, we should have driven down here in my brother's car.
3008440	3011120	Yeah, I don't think that old guy pays too much attention.
3011120	3012120	Obviously not.
3012120	3013600	We're pretty far down the trail anyway.
3013600	3015840	He probably won't be giving us any trouble tonight then.
3015840	3017840	That's true, yeah.
3017840	3021440	Or come to our aid in case of emergency.
3021440	3023200	Good thing we got that first aid kit.
3023200	3025440	Yes and hand sanitizer.
3025440	3028200	And liquor that we can pour on any wounds.
3028200	3032120	So when you guys get to your normal camping spots, what do you do?
3032120	3033120	How do you set up camp?
3033520	3035800	I start building a fire right away.
3035800	3041840	Okay, you notice immediately that there is no wood waiting for you.
3041840	3048320	Normally the contention woods, each camping spot has enough wood for a fire waiting for
3048320	3051040	people to come start a fire.
3051040	3053240	And you got a fire pit, but there's no wood.
3053240	3056640	Damn, good thing there's that log over there and we have an axe.
3056640	3058920	Yeah, go ahead and chop that up.
3058920	3060080	You want to help me?
3060080	3061080	No.
3061080	3067280	Okay, well I go and start chopping at this log that's 20 feet away from the campsite.
3067280	3069680	I know how to lat fire us, I don't know how to create them.
3069680	3073320	So while he's chopping wood, what are you up to, Jeremy?
3073320	3079960	I think it's kind of weird that there's no wood here, especially like Jeremy called ahead.
3079960	3082760	He like made this reservation weeks ago for this spot.
3082760	3089960	Like it was a weird amount of initiative for a 14 year old, but yeah, I'd like to reserve
3089960	3095000	camp spot number B-15, it's Jeremy Pettymore, we come out there every year.
3095000	3097960	Make sure he has some wood for us.
3097960	3099480	I think it's pretty weird.
3099480	3102080	I'm a little frustrated, but I also want to look around.
3102080	3105000	I want to do a little search of the area to see what else is different.
3105000	3106920	All right, go ahead and roll a search for me.
3106920	3107920	89.
3107920	3108920	I do not succeed.
3108920	3109920	All right.
3109920	3118000	So you go looking around in the woods in the area and everything seems to be about normal.
3118000	3122840	And Luke, while you're chopping the wood, I'm going to have you roll an alertness check.
3122840	3125640	42 and a 50.
3125640	3126640	All right.
3126640	3143280	Thomas, if you could leave the room.
3143280	3148880	So I'm chopping at this log and it's just usually the wood is like real nicely chopped
3148880	3150560	and easy to make fires out of.
3150560	3157560	I just have like some just misshapen giant pieces of wood that, you know, will eventually
3157560	3158560	start a fire.
3158560	3160400	But I've never done this before.
3160400	3162360	Disheartened by your attempt.
3162360	3166040	Turn around and I just sit on one of the big pieces that I've chopped and just kind of
3166040	3167040	take a break.
3167040	3177280	As you're sitting there, you hear a rustling and then you see a man's head pops up from
3177280	3184200	behind one of the bushes, alert ears, looks left, looks right, looks, makes dead eye contact
3184200	3187520	with you and pops back down under the bush.
3187520	3190800	My heart stops and my palms get sweaty.
3190800	3191800	Are your knees weak?
3191800	3192800	Are your arms heavy?
3192800	3193800	There they are.
3193800	3194800	Mom's spaghetti
3222800	3250800	The time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon, ooh, ooh,
3250800	3268160	ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh with the howling wind.
3268160	3278300	The sun has come again.
3279300	3290300	Her eyes, her eyes have seen it all.
3290300	3298300	The wonders of, the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
3308300	3322300	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
