0	9720	Knock, knock. Who's there? It's me, Wolf. Wolf who? It's Wolf the dog. Well, I don't
9720	16240	know you. Well, you're about to, baby. Open the damn door of your mind and let me in to
16240	23100	feast upon your brain energy. Y'all know I'm here and devouring all wave-based energies
23100	35540	in my path live from 694.2 PTBP. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Agent Sean McFarland.

86360	93600	know. Probably some fake mumbo jumbo just to scare me into exile. But, uh, that never
93600	98820	happened. I just, uh, gotta pack a few things real quick. Remember, if you wanna write up
98820	104480	something for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople
104480	112160	on Facebook, or write a 5 star review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at gmail.com.
112160	117920	If you want this show to grow and not plateau, you know you gotta crow like an impresario
117920	123960	with the flow of Bordeaux and show every Joe Blow what's good on the radio. Something,
123960	129360	something dildo. But seriously, type about me on the internet. It gives a wolfie the
129360	135600	strength he needs. Y'all, we had a little contest slash giveaway over on the subreddit
135600	142200	at r slash PretendingToBePeople. Huge shout out to user Totoro's Bang Bus on Reddit for
142200	148460	supplying two D&D 5th edition starter sets and a bunch of dice to give away. The first
148460	154000	winner here will receive one of those D&D 5th edition starter sets and five sets of
154000	162880	dice. And that lucky listener is user Curry Chicken Salad. Let's see, oh hell yeah, they
162880	167980	drew the page in the leather bound book found at Jim Cook's house. It is only through death
167980	174000	that he may rise again. The second winner will receive the other D&D 5th edition starter
174000	180720	set, five sets of dice, and a box of D&D dungeon tiles. Luke claims he touched these tiles
180720	192640	so hard. And all that is going to user AnonAnonono. Oh, this dirty motherfucker right here wrote
192640	199200	that fanfic that physically shipped Joe and Clark Bishop. Jesus, man. Seriously, y'all.
199200	204520	Go read that delicious slop if you haven't yet. It should be canon. And that leaves us
204520	210120	with the final winner, the contest winner. Now, this shit ain't random. The boys picked
210160	215520	the favorite entry, and they are proud to present a hardback slip case set of Delta
215520	224280	Green, the role playing game two user SM Farlander. I have a note here from my producer. This
224280	229880	absolutely stellar piece of art made my heart beat out of my chest. The attention to detail,
229880	234800	especially the Polaroids in the background, blew me away and made the immense amount of
234800	240280	time I put into this show feel worth it. Seriously. Thank you. All right, y'all. That's
240280	246880	all well and good, but let's focus now. Fuck the news. The halftime show is just finishing
246880	253880	up and taking us directly into the heart of the scrap pit is kudzu with no back bone.
276880	294280	The jam. Come on and slam if you want to jam. Work that body, work that body, make
294280	299280	sure you don't hurt nobody. Get back, lose your mind. Shake it, break it. Overtime. Hey,
299280	304280	DJ. Turn it up. UCD, you're gonna burn it up. Come on, come on, let's unfold. Say whoop.
304280	314240	There it is. And welcome back to the scrap pit after that incredible halftime show from
314240	319460	Mary Nightingale and the senior citizens. We appreciate your efforts and contributions
319460	325120	to this society here, Mary, and we appreciate everything you've done for the family and
325120	332640	the science. And we are back looking at the massive fight between Planet Juggernaut versus
332640	339120	Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, and Friends, which is just now turned into at friends. What do we think,
339120	343960	Big? This has been a whirlwind. Not as big as a bloodbath as I was expecting, but I am
343960	350880	still quite sated by what I've seen. Six times four rounds. We are 24 seconds into this fight
350880	358280	and boy, howdy. Has it been crazy? But you are right. Traditionally, most contestants
358280	363400	do not make it past the second round here where they are stuck in the pit, in the scrap pit with
363400	370800	Planet Juggernaut. Taking him down to the floor. Yeah, Clark Bishop. All right, Clark Bishop,
370800	378200	you're first. Last we left off, Planet Juggernaut was doing this rolling attack. Has he come to a
378200	383480	stop or is he still rolling around the arena? He was rolling around, but would you rather be still
383480	390040	attached or would you rather be not attached to him with your hands up in him? I would rather be
390040	396360	not attached. Okay, then roll Sanity to decide if you are. Having almost died and being flung
396360	402200	about while still attached to this Planet Juggernaut has led you to rethink some things.
402200	408360	Maybe you're not a god, but maybe that death magic. That's a failure over my fucking power.
408440	415880	All right. That's what I like to see. Go ahead and roll a d4 for me for almost dying.
417000	421080	That's a one. All right, you're only going to lose one Sanity. What's that put you at, five?
421080	428280	I'm at five. Boy, howdy. And in your state of rage, it's hard for me not to jump into,
428280	434360	and in your state of rage, it's my default voice now. Theoretically, Planet Juggernaut is the
434360	439640	closest to me at this point. Theoretically, that is correct. So I'm going to try and wail on him
439640	447000	with my craziness, with my disorder. I don't really have much left up my sleeve. Oh, I've
447000	452680	still got a sniper rifle I haven't used yet. I'm going to pull that out. Awesome. It's got armor
452680	459080	piercing bullets. It's real high powered. My hope is to rip a hole through the son of a bitch. Okay,
459080	464120	so as you go to make this attack, I'm going to need you to roll a Constitution because
464120	473000	inside this dome, we can call it like a biosphere now because wind begins to whip about and form
473000	479560	a slight tornado in the corner and it is moving through toward you. It's picked up
480920	493640	some of Oz Mayhem Wolf's leftovers. Joe just showed us some of his leftovers.
495000	500440	He did a human spit take there. No water involved. No drink necessary.
501560	509160	Just spit on your lip and I'm ready to go. All right, so you will need to roll a Constitution
509160	515160	here in order to hold on to your sniper rifle as this high powered wind velocity
515160	521400	is raging toward you. That's a pass. So you hold on strong and fire your firearm.
522280	529400	A dodge is not necessary because it's impossible to dodge bullets. I pass this one a 34 on an 80.
529400	537560	All right, high powered sniper is going to be 2d10 damage. Nice. That's a 10, right? Yeah. Oh,
537560	546680	yeah. So 17. Planet Juggernaut takes 17 damage as these rounds just pierce.
546680	556040	You actually, a couple of them fly through and they're through and throughs and they fly through
556040	562600	the other side and hit the dome. And once again, you feel the dome, it like takes the energy and
562600	567720	disperses it through the entire dome and the ground that you're standing on. So you all feel
567720	574920	this tremble and it actually knocks Keith Vigna loose from the dome. Like I meant to do, of course.
574920	581400	Exactly. Keith Vigna, it's not your turn, but I'm going to have you go ahead and roll a
581400	587240	dexterity or athletics to fall gracefully instead of hurting yourself. Do we see anything in the
587240	595960	through and through? Oh no, I fail. Okay. So you are, you're going to take a d6 of falling damage.
596680	604920	That's five. And you fall right on your back and much like the upside down of a belly flop.
607880	613000	Joe, you asked about the through and through of the bullets and looking through, you just see
613000	621880	wires and mechanical bits in the very small holes that have been gauged through this massive orb,
622600	629640	machine planet, even of juggernaut proportions. God, it was John was here.
634600	643640	Thomas, is there any activity in Marvin glasses booth? Go ahead and roll a 50 50 shot. I'm a
643640	651640	giant robot 57. So you wanted me to roll over 50 right? I wanted you to roll over 50 and you
652600	664680	the curtains in Marvin glasses booth began rustling much like Jimmy's old school. I mean,
666200	670920	you know that the brand of curtains are Jimmy's curtains and boy, howdy. Are they just wrestling
670920	676600	about? Interesting. Okay. How close am I to either of them? Close enough. I want to try to grab and
676600	682600	pick them both up. Okay. Uh, so we'll do an unarmed competition between each of them
682600	687640	individually. And because you have two actions, typically you don't take a negative on either of
687640	692760	those attacks. So what are, what are we rolling? We're rolling unarmed, unarmed combat against
693720	703960	my fighting. Yes. I pass with a 19. Yeah. I fail with a 96. Okay. I pass with a 14. So that,
703960	709240	that means I miss Keith, but you grab a hold of Clark Bishop. What do you, uh,
713080	719320	Clark Bishop is being held in the, what kind of, uh, like finger arm hands are we dealing with
719320	725640	here with planet juggernaut Thomas? Just fucking giant, like extendo arms and then big comical,
725640	734200	like Disney gloves. Go, go gadget Mickey gloves. We were on the same wavelength for that.
734200	741160	So we're talking four fingers here, four fingers, um, the black lines over each finger.
741960	753080	Uh, so I bring Clark up to me, up to my laser eyes and, and planet juggernaut tries to speak.
753080	759640	Awesome. Can planet juggernaut speak? Yeah, but make it weird.
762520	764840	From within the depths of this saying, you just hear
768840	775560	it's me. It's John. I don't want to fight you.
776360	782360	We've got to find a way out of here and into Marvin Glass's booth.
784040	789160	Can we kill them together? It's almost turning into Mickey Mouse.
790520	796040	No, you want to hear Mickey Mouse. That's Mickey Mouse. You don't know what the fuck
796040	803720	Mickey sounds like. Hey everybody, let's kill Marvin Glass. No, I sounded like this.
804440	809240	Exactly. Like Mickey Mouse. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. My earphones are turned up to high pitch or
809240	815320	something. Okay. Planet juggernaut takes his turn. You want to eat my ass?
819480	828680	Okay. Keith Vigna, you fell on your back and it hurt. Yeah. Um, and you hear, uh, out of the
828680	836440	corner of your ear, this noise from the depths of the big ball. I don't know if at his distance,
836440	844680	he hears anything other than creaking metal, like weirdness. I love it. Yeah. I get up,
844680	854840	Keith gets up and, um, he looks over at them and in his paranoia, he links juggernaut talking
854840	863240	to Clark as them working together against me. So I set up, I set up my 50 cal mounted machine gun
863240	871000	and just let loose at both of them. Incredible. So here's what we're going to do. First off,
871000	878360	the tornado that is flying through the scrap pit currently is going to try to offset.
879080	887880	Thank you. Oh man. We're not in Kansas anymore. It's an unseasonably warm night in contention.
889240	895080	The tornado is coming for you. You got to roll a constitution check to hold steady in this moment.
895080	901560	Can I, uh, add a little bit to use my suction gloves onto the ground and my mounted machine
901560	907880	gun? Give yourself a plus 40. Then I win. That gives me 110. All right. With 110. See if you
907880	918680	crit. Oh, that's true. See if you crit. I crit succeed. You're very stuck. So you're so,
918680	927240	you're so stuck into the ground that I will give you a plus 40% to your firearms check. But since
927240	932280	you're firing at both of them, it would be a negative 40 to fire both of them. So it'll even
932280	937800	out to shoot at both of them. And it's going to be one roll up and down to hit both together.
941080	945800	It's a 90. That's a 99 again. So that is a crit fail.
945800	955640	Wow. That's two 99 in a row. Yeah. From, from the Prince to the, to the popper place. Uh, you,
955640	961240	you boy, you, you just can't, can't seem to do this. What, what do you, uh, what do you think?
962760	969880	Uh, so I unsuction, oh no, I'm still suctioned down with one hand. I grab the mounted machine
969880	975160	gun with my other hand, but the force of it is so powerful. I definitely needed two hands to
975160	979800	shoot this. And it just starts kind of spinning around and just hitting the walls and like kind
979800	985240	of gets near them, but by no means would it be hitting them. So with a critical failure on that,
985240	990120	even though you critically succeeded on the strength to hold down, I'm going to say that
990120	996920	while you fire and it's wagging about all over the place, you yourself lose control of your own
996920	1005960	suctions and get swept away in this tornado as your gun stays put on the ground, along with
1005960	1017560	your shoes. Oh no, my shoe. And you are currently flying through the air, limbs akimbo, shoes missing
1017560	1025880	and everyone can see that burned on the bottom of your left foot is the name Maggie. As the tornado
1025880	1033720	whips you about in the scrap pit. And that is the end of round five here at the scrap pit. We had
1033720	1041160	a hell of a round this time. The old tornado came out to play and Clark Bishop was able to hold on
1041160	1047800	dear Lord tightly and he snipes away, landing a couple shots all the way through planet juggernaut,
1047800	1054280	but he was quick to turn and pick up Clark Bishop straight off the ground. What do we think about
1054280	1059720	all that? Dick, Nickles, Dick, Nickles. You know, Clark Bishop, a reported victim of death magic
1059720	1065640	has flung himself into quite a frenzy. Any rifle at our best friend planet juggernaut, perhaps he
1065640	1070440	wants robot blood to fill his tummy with. What do you think they were talking about out there? They
1070440	1076120	seem to have some sort of low vibrating communication going on. Yeah, you know, it's crazy.
1076120	1081960	I've never seen planet juggernaut try to talk before. Did you hear him talking? I heard something
1081960	1088680	that made my nuts feel weird. It vibrated both at a certain frequency that I have yet to find in
1088680	1093720	this world that I am going to look on the internet to find that out later. You know, it sounded like
1093720	1100200	a crying refrigerator to me. I don't know about you. I hate when my refrigerator's sad. And when
1100200	1106440	moving on, we see Keith Vigna falls off from his safe place up on the top of the dome and he falls
1106440	1112600	straight on his back, immediately slamming his gun into position. But he loses that right off
1112600	1117640	the bat as the tornado sweeps him away and leaving his shoes stuck to the floor. You know, it's crazy
1117640	1123240	to me. Everyone keeps losing their shoes here. I haven't seen so many shoes lost in one match before.
1123320	1127880	Can no one stay shooed? We'll find out later.
1133640	1141400	But first, let's jump to our regular segment here in the scrap pit. Let's get some fighting pro
1141400	1148600	tips from Alfred and Jermaine Glass. I believe we have a pre-recorded session for tonight. Oh,
1148600	1153560	wait. Nope. I'm hearing that it's up for some reason. We're getting the live feed here. Oh,
1153560	1162600	and we see the video screen on the, uh, the giant jumbotron is just a video shot of a dark room with
1162600	1169640	a single light on it. And you see a young man in the shadows of the room who has just cradled
1169640	1173320	himself into the fetal position and he's rocking back and forth.
1174200	1182360	A gun. Some sort of gun. He disappeared. It came after him. It came after him and it disappeared.
1183080	1187080	He didn't have a chance in the gun. The gun disappeared. I mean, one disappeared,
1187080	1190680	the other disappeared. Why didn't I disappear? If I don't disappear, where's the girl? The
1190680	1195480	girl came in. I just, I don't know what to, I don't, it's the gun. It's the gun. Oh,
1195480	1201000	boy. Howdy. Thank you for that. Alfred, we seem to have gotten a weird connection there
1201000	1204600	from Alfred Glass. Those are bad. I don't think we got any fighting pro tips there,
1204600	1209880	did we Dick? No, I don't think so at all. He seemed a man possessed by something to me.
1209880	1217080	If you yourself are in the scrap pit, I would not suggest rolling up in a fetal position. All right,
1217080	1221960	let's get back into the fight with the top of the round. So we got Clark Bishop at the top of round
1221960	1228120	six. Clark is wide-eyed having heard this mechanical planet juggernaut beast speaking
1228120	1232120	to him and claiming to be John. But this isn't the first time that he's had somebody who doesn't
1232120	1238600	look like John tell him he's John. So he's all ears. Roll sanity for me. John is always around
1238600	1249000	you, Clark. What am I rolling? Oh, sanity. Fuck. Oh, my God. So fucking close. It's a seven on a
1249000	1256520	five. Damn, dude. You were right there. All right. Well, you're going to take a D4 of sanity damage
1256520	1268680	here. What? No. Oh, good. It's four. Oh, my God. I've got one sanity. Look out, world. Clark Bishop
1268680	1276520	is fucking losing his mind. It's fine with me. It sucks, but it's fine. But Clark, having lost
1276520	1281880	all the sanity, he is convinced. He didn't need much to believe that this is John talking to him
1281880	1287480	now. So I want to stand on the palm of the hand that I've been gripped in and I'm raising my
1287480	1294920	hands up to where I think Planet Juggernaut's eyes and face are. John, you're you're you're in there.
1295720	1307720	It's really me, buddy. You got you got to help us. You look like you're losing your mind.
1312520	1316120	Maybe Clark probably starts like babbling at this point, like half listening to you
1316760	1326680	and losing his mind. But there's Keith and there's a tornado.
1329240	1334120	Don't worry about what happens to Keith. Let's just kill Marvin Blass.
1335080	1342120	And with that, it is Planet Juggernaut's turn. Go ahead and roll a fifty fifty shot here,
1342920	1347160	depending on whether or not you roll lower or higher. We'll see what you're trying to roll.
1348120	1352280	That was a joke about last time. Twenty five. Congratulations. That's a success.
1353160	1360040	Okay. What was I rolling for? Planet Juggernaut, you have these, like I said earlier, Oz Mayhem
1360040	1367560	Wolf had this visor on his helmet that made it hard for you to track his movements. So I'm
1367560	1376680	picturing like full blown like robot vision for you and your robot vision as you're talking to
1376680	1382440	Clark Bishop, who's standing in the palm of your hand, blinks in the crowd and you see that there's
1382440	1388680	specific movement and you actually you see a young, bald, fit man with sunken, intense eyes
1388680	1395320	wearing a black T-shirt and jeans. And he is walking through the crowd and he is heading
1395320	1402440	directly for an exit that is nearby Marvin Glass's box. That's all. It's your turn.
1402440	1408680	Planet Juggernaut looks at Joe and he's like, it'll be fine, buddy. And they hover off.
1408680	1411400	It's Joe! They hover off.
1414520	1418040	I didn't say Joe. You're going crazy.
1419320	1425800	So we hover off towards the part of the dome that the box is behind and I gently set Clark
1425800	1433320	down on the ground and then I just reel both robot fists back and I want to smash the wall.
1433320	1438520	Roll strength for me. That's a pass. I have 315 strength.
1440440	1448040	We found the giant robot rule spec out from Pulp Cthulhu and we're using some of those
1448040	1451480	stats for Planet Juggernaut. I have 315, so.
1451480	1455320	Yeah, just roll an up and down check there. Let's see if you critically succeed here.
1457880	1459640	Oh, 60. Oh, 69!
1464920	1467000	House rules, baby. That's fucking gorgeous.
1467000	1479560	Thomas, Planet Juggernaut reaches out its arms and pulls them back to get as much momentum
1480120	1490600	as Donkey Kongingly possible. And as it swings forward and pounds its giant mechanical Mickey
1490600	1500360	Mouse pants into the dome, your hands, they like stick immediately. You feel like the adhesive
1500360	1510120	from the dome, but they power through and the entire dome slowly creaks and the whole thing
1510120	1517320	splinters like a spider on a spider web. If you'll let me describe something real quick.
1517320	1519560	I would love for you to describe something real quick.
1519560	1526520	Before the place just erupts in terrified screams, there is a dead silence as people
1526520	1530440	see this thing crack, but you hear the loudest woo.
1530440	1545720	Yes, my boy! Planet Juggernaut! Woo!
1545720	1550680	This guy, the trip from Akron was worth it for a day.
1550680	1561080	And the entire dome shatters into this strange dust that just floats down. Okay,
1561080	1566840	so my favorite fireworks are the ones that go boom. And then as it like comes up,
1566840	1574200	you don't really see it. And then you hear just like boom. And then there's a giant round. It's
1574200	1578840	all like the gold. Oh yeah. And it's like pop rocks. I know the boys you mean. Like weeping
1578840	1584040	willows. Yes. And then it just like, oh, and then it comes. And that's exactly what this dome looks
1584040	1593320	like as it pours down. And people start losing their fucking minds. But rounds are only six
1593320	1598520	seconds. So we've got time. Keith Vigno, you're up. What are you doing? As soon as this happens,
1598520	1602840	Keith's first thought after he had been sucked up into the tornado was that that was my only
1602840	1609480	chance to get rid of my two enemies now. So now that I'm surrounded by bloodthirsty people,
1609480	1616040	I'm aiming my nitro thrower just at everybody in the arena around me and just like
1616040	1625240	blasting them with it. And in an attempt to freeze people so I can escape. Roll firearms.
1627640	1630360	That's a pass. How many people do you want to hurt?
1630360	1640280	So how many people are in this arena completely? What did you roll on the dice? A 37. You
1640280	1647160	37 people get frozen solid as they're like trying to make their honestly they're just really scared
1647160	1654760	and trying to like leave and you make fucking damn sure that they can't. Yep. That's what I do.
1654760	1664600	All right, that's the end of round six. And what a so horrifying round of this fight. Boy,
1664600	1670200	howdy. I have never seen anything like this happen. Are you scared for your life, Nick?
1670200	1674200	I am absolutely terrified right now, brother. In the background,
1674200	1677880	Planet Juggernaut just lets out like a T-Rex roar from Jurassic Park.
1678840	1681960	Oh, wait, that's a that's what he does. Oh, okay, cool.
1685400	1693960	That's the closest idea. Did you like that? Yeah, man. It was just like I was in
1693960	1698520	Jurassic Park for the first time. Yeah. All right, Nick. No matter how scared we are,
1698520	1703480	we have to continue to do. It's our job and we take it extremely seriously, don't we, Nick? Yes,
1703480	1709720	we take it quite seriously to report this action the minute it happens. So let's go ahead and give
1709720	1716040	a recap there. We had Clark Bishop, who seemingly for the first time in any scrap pit combat,
1716040	1721320	has become friends with Planet Juggernaut. When he held him in his hand, the two seemed to talk
1721320	1725800	to each other for some time. Now, I certainly read this that Clark seems to have fallen in
1725800	1731800	love with the giant mechanical monstrosity, as we all have at one time or another. Ship them and I
1731800	1736680	will watch it. The allure of metal spheres is great for the Nichols family. Am I right, brother?
1736680	1740360	You could not be more wrong. Or the opposite of what I just said.
1742200	1748760	Less wrong. I agree with you whole cloth. And Planet Juggernaut, I mean, what a performance.
1748760	1755960	I have never seen a slave monster robot breaking shackles in such an entertaining and firework
1755960	1762280	explode-y type way. It was really something. He did quite a big smash, I think is what we call it
1762280	1767160	in the fighting community. That is right. He was the original who came up with that move. Who was
1767160	1779000	that back in 1947? The original big smash came from? Mike Tyson. Hey guys, thanks for having me
1779000	1783480	come in on the booth. I just wanted to give a quick shout out to Planet Juggernaut for using
1783480	1789560	my cool move that I came up with in 1947. Thanks, Big Smash Mike Tyson. And it's a pleasure to be
1789560	1801880	here. And we got... Keith Vigna, in a true show of his own colors, turns on the crowd and sprays
1801880	1808040	some sort of terrible, terrible, obnoxious, freezing gas all over them. Freezing about,
1808040	1812440	if my math is right, what do you think that was, like 37 to me? Yeah, you know, he froze
1812440	1819240	37 people, but I'd say at least 15 of those were small children. Oh, goodness gracious. We all
1819240	1824920	know that those lives are boring board. So that makes us sadder. It's like, welcome to family
1824920	1840360	night. 12 and under getting free. Let's head down now to a little interview section where we talk
1840360	1846440	to some of the crowd here at the scrap pit. We've got Jeremiah Johnson down in the crowd and ready
1846440	1853480	to talk. Hey everybody, it's Jeremiah Johnson. I'm here with three individuals that it seems like
1854200	1863400	are at least half to fully frozen in some sort of liquid that has covered them. This first person
1863400	1872840	puts the mic up to your mouth. Yeah, that's really interesting. Thanks for coming to the
1872840	1881000	scrap pit tonight and let's move on to the second person here and holds up the mic to you. So cold.
1881000	1887160	Oh yeah, it is cold in here. I've asked them if they could make it warmer, but they say the body
1887160	1891000	heat makes it so that we need to turn the thermostats way down and also we're underground,
1891000	1896680	so it's always cold. And the third person who's here, their mouth seems to be a little bit more
1896680	1903000	unstuck. Hey there Jeremiah. It looks like Keith there got me mostly from the waist down. I'm
1903000	1907880	rooted in place here and I'm telling you what, I'm terrified. How does it feel to be frozen from the
1907880	1914200	waist down, sir? It doesn't feel good. And real quick, what's your name? Charles Snort.
1916760	1922040	I'm Charles Snort. I came here to take advantage of the family night. Is this your child next to
1922040	1925240	you on the lot that we just interviewed? No, I don't know where my child is at this point.
1926680	1941960	As he says that, we see in the background from the curtains over the box. What is that called?
1941960	1947160	Box seats? Just the box? The box where the curtains are up, the Jimmy's curtains,
1947160	1954600	are swaying and trembling and then all of a sudden an exorbitant amount of dirty water
1954600	1961880	filled with different kinds of fish and a few humanoid figures explodes out of this theater box
1961880	1970600	like a rushing waterfall cascading down multiple stories, the torrential downpour flowing steadily
1970600	1977560	into the scrap pit. Can we see or recognize the bodies? Nope, not currently. It is just about
1977560	1986120	four bodies that are all flying haphazardly, mostly covered in the water. And with that,
1986120	1992360	we will head to the top of round seven. Clark Bishop, it is your turn. I'm essentially wanting
1992360	1996040	to see, like I've seen this torrent of water coming out of up there, but I'm really wanting
1996040	2005800	to see hopefully Marvin. I'm assuming that's where he would be. Sure. I pass a 32 on a 70.
2005800	2014520	What you're gonna see is a few things. These four bodies, two of which are a short young woman and
2014520	2022200	a tall old man, both wearing black suits, black ties, white shirts, ill-fitting windbreakers,
2022200	2027400	and you see that FBI has written on the back of them. They decided to wear their FBI windbreakers
2027400	2033640	into the scrap pit and they flew over the water. There's also the bald man wearing the black t-shirt
2033640	2039320	and the jeans, who you would recognize as Billy Harrison, and the other two is Agent
2039320	2046040	Kennedy and Agent McKinley. And the fourth body you see is tall and gaunt and wearing a black
2046040	2054680	tuxedo and the skin stretched across these long bones and it is Marvin Glass. And the four bodies
2054680	2062920	are all washed down so hard. The water pushes them so hard it pushes them into the scrap pit with you.
2062920	2070520	Water is now filling up the coliseum and as that happens the dome begins to regrow. With that
2070520	2075000	alertness roll, can I tell, are they conscious? All four bodies are conscious? They're just being
2075720	2080520	swept away? That is correct. I mean I'd like to take a shot at Marvin with my turn if I see that
2080520	2084840	happen. You do see that happen and you may take a shot at Marvin with your turn. I'm gonna do that
2084840	2093000	with that sniper rifle. I already head out. Pass a 16 on an 80. Roll 2d10 for damage.
2094680	2100120	Uh 14. Uh yeah 14. Nice. As soon as he lands you put three bullets in him.
2103880	2112360	As he gets fucking pissed. He hates it. He hates getting shot. Oh man I fucking hate getting shot.
2112360	2118920	He fucking hates getting shot. Planet juggernaut it's your turn. I watched these bodies fall and
2118920	2124440	I turn around and I'm just bringing both fists down on Marvin. Roll fighting. I guess uh one
2124440	2134600	and then the other. Fail the first one. God damn it two fails. You splash on both sides of him
2134600	2140520	into the water and it I mean if anything it's intimidating. Before I've used all my actions
2140520	2147480	I want to say. Clark jump on me and save yourself from the rising waters.
2152200	2158440	Keith Vigna it's your turn. I see the water come in. I'm no longer concerned with the uh frozen
2158440	2167720	people. They've calmed my nerves uh because they are not moving. I see that. Everybody's relaxed.
2168680	2175240	I turn around. Everybody be cool. I turn around and I see Marvin Glass and I I see those shots
2175240	2181400	go into him and then I see you know juggernaut pound and I can't see whether he misses or not
2181400	2189560	but I let loose a stream of frozen nitro and just try to freeze Marvin Glass into place and
2189640	2192360	the water around him. Go ahead and roll firearms.
2195480	2200760	It's a fail. Actually you know what? You're gonna spend some luck. I'm gonna spend some luck. Yes.
2200760	2208040	Nice. I'm gonna spend 19 points of luck to make that a success. Absolutely. What's that put your
2208040	2216760	luck at? Uh 30 minus 19 is 11 if that's weird. Plus five so 16. All right. I didn't know what
2216760	2224040	your luck was at. Good guess. Fucking clearly. I just let loose all the rest of the fuel I guess
2224040	2230040	that I have in this. Just spraying on Marvin and all around him on the water and just try to
2230040	2238600	completely icicle him. And that is what happens. Oh at the end of round seven. Oh my goodness.
2238600	2243880	Nick Nichols. Nick Nick Nick Nichols. What do you think about all that? What a season it's been
2243960	2249880	today. What a season. Oh my goodness. I have not seen such sportsmanship here in a long time. And
2249880	2255240	you know what's interesting? A sort of people stew is starting to be made down there and believe me
2255240	2261400	brother I'm ready to dive in and get me a mouthful. I love two things in this world. One is stew and
2261400	2269160	the second is crawfish boils. And boy howdy is this the first one. All right. In that first
2269160	2276120	round oh boy in round seven we had Clark Bishop who when we saw the water start pouring from the
2276120	2282120	box where Marvin Glass typically resides with his whole retinue of Kevin and Rosemary and
2282120	2288920	worm figures and Francis Beans we really did not expect that. What a boy howdy they just flew right
2288920	2292840	on out of there with some people that I personally did not recognize. Did you recognize any of those
2292840	2299080	people? I don't know most of those people. And so Clark Bishop he takes a shot right
2299640	2305400	at Marvin Glass. All hail Marvin Glass. All hail Marvin Glass. And he fires true making him public
2305400	2311640	into being number one here today. He is really taking a heel turn here in the scrap pit. And
2311640	2315880	Planet Juggernaut he needed tips to help out punching down on either side of Marvin Glass
2315880	2319400	spraying water up all earth planes. What do we think about that? You know it's crazy you
2319400	2325720	mentioned a heel turn but really Planet Juggernaut is taking quite a turn also. Is it now its own
2325720	2332520	robot beholden to no man? Is free will even real? You could say that again. Is free will even real?
2332520	2338840	You could say that again. Is free will even real? Amazing and in the last Keith Vigna there he goes
2338840	2343000	ahead and uses his weird gun that I personally have never seen used here in the scrap pit that
2343000	2349880	makes the nitro freeze and it freezes all the way down and he makes a little icicle a little
2349880	2356840	popsicle there. Marvin Glassicle if you will and he is fully surrounded in frozen water. I'd just
2356840	2370680	like to say when Marvin screamed I definitely didn't not shit my pants. And before what I'm
2370680	2376040	guessing is the final round of combat here at the scrap pit tonight we're gonna go ahead and
2376040	2381800	send it over to a crowd favorite over at our jumbotron it is the dance of the silver ball.
2381800	2388520	And you guys look up at the jumbotron and you see there are three skulls that pop up on the screen
2389320	2394440	and one of the skulls cracks open and there's a small silver ball sitting underneath them and it
2394440	2400760	goes into one of the skulls and then the skulls all do a little dance to the music and then
2401400	2406680	halfway through one of the skulls opens up and the sphere comes out of it and goes into a different
2406680	2412760	one and then it gets faster the second time around and then when it's done it's weird because
2412760	2418040	everyone would be like really freaked out by what's happening but for the most part people
2418040	2428200	love the dance of the silver spear so everyone's just like two two three two one two and it opens
2428280	2435880	and it was one and people continue to flee they've all turned around at the exits
2437480	2443400	all right wow what a crazy sphere dance all right let's get back to the action
2443400	2449880	it was clark clark bishop it's your turn it's the top of round eight and at the top of round eight
2449880	2458040	the floor begins to shake and vibrate as the dome fully rounds itself back out in a very fun
2458280	2464280	magical fashion it pieces together a wholly new dome that is still made out of this crystal clear
2464280	2470920	material however the ground begins rumbling violently it's your turn what do you want to do
2470920	2475000	i'm going to make a mad dash for planet juggernaut and on my way i'm going to yell
2475640	2478600	keith planet juggernaut's john and i keep going
2481080	2486040	and i try and climb just like up onto planet juggernaut whatever the easiest way to do that is
2486040	2490200	sure you uh what would be the easiest way to do that thomas uh there's any number of convenient
2490200	2496280	like access ports and uh crevices in my hardware and you just like assassin's creed your way right
2496280	2500600	up there nice and that's my whole action i'm just gonna ride out whatever's gonna happen next with
2500600	2512440	my giant buddy awesome uh planet juggernaut it's your turn planet john or not have you had that
2512440	2528840	locked and loaded for a week no two um so he's he's like hold on tight buddy he wants to rush
2528840	2533640	up towards the ceiling like the dome before it closes in on itself and like try to get out the
2533640	2540120	other side amazing you're gonna need to make a um what's it called a roll for that i don't know
2540120	2546920	what you'll be rolling here um did you succeed doing a lot of yeah 50 50s so 38 38 that's a

2572920	2580040	arm like flying out towards keith vigna um as the other one is like reaching up towards an opening
2580040	2585640	at the top of the dome they're both like zipping out from the main body like kind of at equal
2585640	2592280	speeds and one one is gonna try to just like pick up keith and take him with us as the other
2592280	2597880	one launches us through like as i see him arm reach out to me i throw down my riot shield

2604120	2611560	marvin glass and throw my arms up in order for him to have a good grip on me there's a rule in
2611560	2619000	tabletop role-playing games that many people call the rule of cool so that all happens yeah
2623720	2624600	i love you
2629320	2639480	can i roll some damage no okay cool what happens next is fucking bonkers but first let's recap
2639480	2646680	what just happened clark bishop sprinted across to planet juggernaut while screaming out to keith
2646680	2656280	that john is planet juggernaut clark then began climbing up this massive metal sphere keith threw
2656280	2663800	down his riot shield like motherfucking electric shock and skim boarded toward planet juggernaut
2663800	2671720	while he pulled out his soft winging crossbow and fired a circular saw blade into the brendan
2671720	2679080	fraser style cube of icy trapped marvin glass in brendan fraser he was that one right yeah and
2679080	2688440	oh uh leaning tower of cheezah guy is there and you see him in the crowd and he says something cool
2689000	2699400	and then the ground the floor of the scrap pit begins to pulsate like it's breathing it expands
2699400	2706040	to the point of breaking and up through these metal shards that once made up the stage of the
2706040	2717560	scrap pit comes flowing and bubbling hot liquid magma the floor is lava and planet juggernaut
2717560	2723400	after gogo gadgeting one mickey mouse hand to swoop up keith vigna and the other to fling
2723400	2728840	yourself and your insane compatriots up out of the scrap pit as the dome completes its
2728840	2737400	reincarnation you look down and see marvin glass frozen in some strange chemical compound
2738200	2748280	disappear into the lava and you are standing on top of the dome of the scrap pit what do you want
2748280	2754120	to do i i plopped the boys into a little pocket in my juggernaut shirt that i've been wearing this
2754120	2760520	whole time a big t-shirt that says planet juggernaut and i rolled down the dome straight
2760520	2767800	to where the announcers are nick nichols what do you think about this new thing that is currently
2767800	2773320	happening we are seeing planet juggernaut with two friends rolling straight towards us now i hope
2773320	2778680	it's for a warm embrace because we're as big as fans you do see his arms like outstretched
2778680	2783800	towards you oh my god look at his arms they're all outstretched toward him let's give this big
2783800	2791160	fella a hug nick and nick nichols both are holding up their arms in a hug-like manner
2791160	2797720	and the last thing they see is two giant mickey mouse gloves swooping in to just embrace them
2797720	2809640	oh with death
2828120	2835640	so
2838120	2839400	the screen goes dark
