0.00 48.36 speaker0  Hello to all my friends from the underworld, the overworld, and the in-between world. It's your multi-dimensional devilish demon wolf the dog, and I'm also a radio DJ for the station we all know and love, 694.2 PTBP. And I'm here to provide you with ear cream in the form of my beautiful soul tree voice. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is the cream of the ear crop, and it's from TLN in Kansas
44.84 58.84 speaker1  right now, like super easily.
52.48 136.56 speaker0  Hello wolf, and thank you for the ceaseless howlin', keepin' me company upon these dayless moors. TLN here from Kansas City to give a shout out to the very vilest viziers whose creative powers have wrought upon this world great and terrible things. Because of you we have unleashed the weird and wild, the book of gob, the thawing kingdom, marvelous mutations and merry musicians, and very soon the world shall behold the dreadful sunny smiles unicorn farm and unicorn meat. know what in the ever lovin' fuck any of it meant. If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag us on the internet or write
134.36 191.52 speaker1  The links are in the show notes. The sausage links are in the gross throats. On the golf links I have the most strokes. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg it's time for the news.
187.72 217.78 speaker0  Will the Last Branch gain a key third member? is with Cicero Mordaunt's new invention that requires all these cables and antennae? Will Scott admit that Elden Ring is a perfect character name?
214.86 273.38 speaker1  No one sane will follow.
259.82 299.74 speaker2  Hollow and you sang I thought you might be starving So I gave you everything
295.74 378.18 speaker3  What do you do, Luke, to get into the mindset of a role-playing session? Wake up, roll out of bed, and sit down on the couch. What about you, Scott? Maybe a different answer? I don't do any prep for anything. I mean, if I'm GM, you're lucky if I read the fucking scenario. I'm so jealous of your skills. I worked out a while back that I was absolutely shit at character voices, so I don't really try them anymore. I feel like you give them vocal affectations even though you don't do accents. But it's the wrong fucking accent for everything I've run for.
374.26 381.34 speaker2  No, the next one is he's going to force us to do English accents.
378.18 383.34 speaker3  The next time, we'll all do English accents. Oh, God.
382.34 397.78 speaker2  Hey, Scott, would you like an accent? It'll just be Beatles and Cockney accents. Yeah, that's cool. We're the Beatles.
396.78 402.78 speaker3  already. Don't confuse me.
400.78 422.96 speaker2  Is that good? Wow. RDJ?
421.96 424.96 speaker3  Real Genius? Yeah.
423.96 426.96 speaker2  Something like that.
425.96 430.96 speaker3  Real Genius. Yeah. I like that one. Oh, God.
429.96 435.46 speaker2  I haven't thought about that film since the 90s.
431.96 440.82 speaker3  It was one of those movies that would run on HBO when I was a kid. It's just perfectly childish enough that I was into it.
439.82 446.10 speaker2  Yeah.
445.10 478.50 speaker3  Yeah. Were there nipples on taxi cab confessions? You know, if the driver was shirtless.
475.06 492.04 speaker2  from your parents that you were looking at?
486.24 558.92 speaker3  that I encountered at a fairly young age that shaped me and my parents really didn't like when they encountered it was a book called Image of the Beast by Philip Jose Farmer, 60s or 70s. To give you an example of the kind of book it is. One of the characters in this is Gilles de Rais, AKA Bluebeard, but it's not the classic Gilles de Rais. He's been reincarnated and he now lives as this snake-like entity living in the womb of one of the female characters. And his shtick basically is every time she has sex with anyone, he comes out and just bites the cock of the person who's having sex with her and kills him.
557.92 581.62 speaker2  Well thanks a lot, Scott. I didn't need to know I was into that too. I had a VHS of Double Jeopardy and there's a sex scene in that movie and I would just watch that. a sex scene in this Jeopardy.
577.90 585.02 speaker3  I was just thinking, I don't remember Trebek ever working with me.
584.02 635.90 speaker2  Let's go to... So my parents exposed me to a ton of media and stuff. They were separated, so my dad was a little more permissive about what I got to watch. Well, like a lot more permissive. Oh my God. I was... 30? I was 30, yeah. I was seven years old and my dad was like, hey, there's this show I think you're going to really like, but you can't tell your mom you watch it when you're over here. And so for a few years, South Park was a secret, but that was literally the only thing I had to not tell one of my parents about. It's called VeggieTales.
634.90 646.24 speaker3  It's Pokemon.
640.90 661.26 speaker2  I did read all the Left Behind books and it gave me night terrors. It didn't work. It was just anxiety, guys. It was just anxiety the whole time. Religion.
660.26 673.50 speaker3  It's a hell of a drug. That is young to watch South Park.
671.50 687.18 speaker2  I was probably nine by the time he showed it to me. it. And he was like, if you like The Simpsons, you're going to fucking love this shit.
682.02 696.38 speaker3  I'm not going to say how old I was when South Park came out.
693.94 700.22 speaker2  You'd already lived so much life, Scott. So how did South Park hit you?
697.74 720.54 speaker3  All right, let's kick into... Appropriately. Yeah. The target demographic. Colputhulu.
718.82 735.38 speaker2  Colputhulu. Actually the P is silent. It's just Thulu. We introduced our characters and made it to the party and kind of got acquainted with the goings on of what's happening at the party. Can we give a quick rundown of our names and our characters real quick?
734.38 764.18 speaker3  Thomas?
763.18 781.22 speaker2  Star of... Favorite movie she was in. Nope. She did a whole series. Last Train series. Yeah, they're some of my favorites.
775.26 792.14 speaker5  I like the rom-com First Train to Love Town.
790.22 818.66 speaker2  What is your guy going by here at the party? David Ellington. sticking out of kind of like the front of the house and also the tower that seems to have been built outside of this estate.
817.66 845.86 speaker3  Yeah. There we go. Eldon was making his way through the crowd. Oh, get it?
844.86 862.98 speaker5  What is your name?
861.98 904.34 speaker3  crowd as well. I think she's, you reckon, probably in her mid 40s. She's got fairly frizzy reddish brown hair. She's got thick glasses on. She's wearing a bald gown that doesn't quite fit. and immediately sort of whisks you off and starts dancing with you.
901.06 906.34 speaker2  He's looking up to her as they're dancing.
904.38 916.26 speaker5  His feet are on her feet, like.
912.98 931.66 speaker3  And she's swinging you through the crowd. Not really, no.
930.66 970.66 speaker2  Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Did you just perform a psychic attack? He thought it so loud. So you tell me if I'm wrong here, but I believe we roll a power contest against each other.
967.06 979.62 speaker3  So is your goal basically just to get it to go away at this stage?
971.66 989.06 speaker2  So my goal is to continue dancing with her while basically intimidating her into continuing dancing with me while I completely eliminate all of her magic points and she comes under
987.56 1002.78 speaker3  Is this how you get cult members? Holy shit.
998.26 1015.06 speaker2  Well I passed with a 62 under a 90. Regular success.
1013.06 1054.36 speaker3  Okay, she failed. Oh, sick. You're trying to grasp hold of her will, but it's like it's already in the thrall of something else. You could give me, I'd say, another power roll here to see whether you can deduce what's going on.
1053.36 1064.60 speaker2  59 under 90.
1060.32 1104.52 speaker3  You're looking into the darkness that is enveloping her mind. Try to find something, anything to hold onto and there is something in the darkness there with you. You can just hear this growling voice from all around, this sibilant growling voice that
1098.40 1142.04 speaker2  So as far as sanity goes, I have 90 because my power and I rolled a 63. I thought you were going to say, what's your deal? What's your deal?
1139.88 1157.40 speaker3  I want to see it succeed in every way possible. It's got to change the world, you know.
1156.40 1165.08 speaker2  the world. I too am interested in learning about these things. Oh, yeah, of course you are.
1163.48 1172.60 speaker3  It's got to change the world, you know. What will it do? It's got to change the world.
1170.92 1181.36 speaker5  Everyone here has been brainwashed.
1177.56 1192.76 speaker2  He's going to try to like get in and then fucking fight. Like once he's in her mind space, he wants to punch up.
1191.76 1196.72 speaker3  got to her first?
1192.76 1254.80 speaker2  Yeah, I'm playing, uh, what's that lawn game with the balls? Psychic croquet sounds amazing, but how are you playing psychic croquet with her? ball, so then you put your foot on your croquet ball and smack it and then it shoots theirs off in a crazy direction. I'm smacking her and the point is to make the movement happen on the other side of her. I like this. You make that work. I do like that. So I rolled power again and I got an aught 5.
1253.32 1264.70 speaker3  So you've got an extreme. Yes. I see him.
1260.56 1286.80 speaker2  mind in his space, he's a silly goose, he doesn't know who he's messing with, he's messing
1280.86 1318.68 speaker3  like there's no resistance and yeah, you can push through her mind and connect with this to try to pull your mind back, you can.
1317.68 1335.54 speaker5  like three drinks. So I'm feeling pretty wild, but I see him dancing and not talking to the senator and I am not very happy about that.
1330.42 1357.40 speaker2  looking and paying attention to the face during a psychic attack, they're contorted in pain and confusion.
1351.86 1390.80 speaker3  The woman who was leading him through the crowd now seems to be standing over him. You see Eldon just fall to the ground with a heavy thump and she's standing over. Are you all right, mister? And at least you think that's what she's saying. You could barely hear her over the band. And there are a few other people who've stopped their conversation and now gathering around.
1386.70 1405.74 speaker5  And I pull out like a little vial from my pocket. It's like smelling salts. Oh, nice. Sure.
1404.34 1456.70 speaker3  If you want to spend 10 points of luck for that, that's perfect. And as you do so, I mean, there is a hand that comes down on your shoulder and as you look around, you can see that there is this clergyman who you've seen moving through the good looks. He gives you a concerned look looking down at Eldon as well and says, uh, is your friend quite all right there?
1451.70 1481.76 speaker5  He's got a condition, but this bad boy right here usually snaps him right out of it. What happened? I mean, actually, no, you have a condition. This happens all the time.
1478.60 1486.80 speaker2  Don't tell me what happened right here in front of this guy.
1485.80 1495.26 speaker3  Who are you by the way? Oh, I'm sorry. That's terribly rude of me. I'm Reverend Nye.
1494.26 1496.26 speaker5  Uh, Reverend Nye.
1495.26 1500.90 speaker2  Is it Bill Nye? Is it Bill Nye?
1499.10 1516.52 speaker5  I think Eldon, are you good? I think I don't know that I want to be isolated at the party unless you feel like you need
1510.14 1526.28 speaker3  He gestures at one of the serving staff who's going past and just says some water for this young man here.
1521.04 1530.88 speaker2  I would like to look into his eyes and try to get a read on him.
1526.28 1545.38 speaker5  Yeah, I was going to say, is there like a human type, uh, skill? That's psychology. Psychology. Perfect. Can I psychology this guy to see why he's trying to isolate us? Okay.
1544.38 1547.38 speaker3  make that.
1546.38 1562.02 speaker5  Let's do it. Minus 18.
1553.54 1574.38 speaker3  There is something about his manner for all the urbaneness that strikes you as being terribly
1573.38 1576.38 speaker5  That's right.
1575.38 1588.66 speaker2  It's a party.
1587.66 1645.50 speaker5  meet you. Maybe we can catch up later, but we've got an important business to attend to and I kind of gesture towards the Senator. Well, if you read this, uh, you know, you'll, you'll know what I'll be wanting to talk about later. And I hand him one of my pamphlets.
1644.50 1650.74 speaker3  with someone else.
1646.50 1660.34 speaker5  And yeah, we'll, we'll head towards the Senator Billings.
1655.06 1663.54 speaker3  Let's cut back to our scientific investigation team outside.
1662.54 1669.58 speaker2  Okay.
1668.58 1672.58 speaker3  your own.
1671.58 1676.58 speaker5  You're right.
1672.58 1689.14 speaker2  We found some, we got some better coats. Lafayette wants to go see this tower.
1687.58 1705.38 speaker5  We've, we've got to get to the bottom of this.
1703.30 1744.02 speaker2  And so you're, you're a delight, Avi. It's easy to do.
1739.90 1754.54 speaker3  of grounds of the manor house and the outbuildings. So it does overlook some woodland, but it's not actually in the woodland. Gotcha.
1750.38 1767.02 speaker5  When you get up to the top of it, is it like one that kind of has like a like porch around the outside and you like walk through a door into a building or is it just like open on the top?
1765.02 1777.94 speaker2  Luke's trying to fast forward.
1772.78 1785.94 speaker3  of it, the top of it in the darkness and the snow isn't really visible. There is a ladder that goes up to the center of it.
1783.46 1790.90 speaker5  It's just like a ladder that goes up to, okay.
1789.90 1833.22 speaker2  get there a lot faster. And it gives Harvey a knowing, like wink. I just hadn't had the moment to- Does Scott know? No, Scott doesn't know. Nope. Don't tell Scott. Cicero Mordant is going to eat fucking crow when he sees my cool ass gadget. Oh, you hypnotized a bunch of fucking assholes at your mansion? Well, I can't say anymore, but you'll see. I think he can fly.
1829.78 1837.98 speaker5  I gathered some sort of levitation device. Levitation device? No.
1835.22 1874.98 speaker2  Are you guys coming louder or what? Gotcha. It's not at the time, Harvey, but so they keep trudging on through the snow towards that tower. And you mentioned some outbuildings. Are they like a groundskeeper's house or is it more like industry, like science-y?
1865.98 1898.54 speaker3  But the ones that you're passing on your way to the tower, there's some old stables, there's some garages, there's this building, which, yeah, maybe a groundskeeper's cottage or something like that, where there does seem to be a party going on for the chauffeurs. I mean, the only building that you can think of that might have anything to do with that
1895.82 1911.82 speaker2  is Mordant's laboratory, but you haven't been there yet. Jesus.
1907.74 1924.82 speaker4  At the bottom of this tower, is there any of that stuff that we can see on top? Are there wires or anything coming down the legs of the tower?
1917.66 1952.42 speaker3  It is basically just a wooden frame with some metal supports and a ladder going up. The ladder is slightly iced over, but as long as you're careful going up and down, you should be fine.
1949.70 1964.38 speaker2  I was imagining we're licking everyone.
1963.38 1996.22 speaker4  Okay.
1995.22 2042.74 speaker3  up there. But, I mean, if you try it, it's not locked, you can just push it open. some maybe work benches or consoles or something like that, a lot of wiring. looks like the kind of huge light or bulb or whatever that you'd see in a lighthouse.
2041.74 2048.30 speaker4  up the ladder behind me?
2043.26 2054.18 speaker3  I mean, he's 100 feet down below in high winds, you're not going to be able to shout down
2049.30 2066.82 speaker2  So he's peering up and as soon as he sees Harvey peek his head up and get in there and
2061.02 2102.98 speaker3  It is a bit of a tricky climb at times, again, because of the high winds and the icy rungs, are rattling a bit in the high winds. You can see outside in the darkness the shape of a variety of aerials poking out. There seems to be a lot of wiring inside and yeah, this light up above you.
2100.30 2123.06 speaker2  I'm sorry, Zach?
2118.30 2155.98 speaker4  like aerial is, so yeah. Did the nipples that we saw earlier, are they, uh, is there any more of them from our vantage point now? Are there any more on the house or anything?
2150.06 2199.26 speaker3  aerial you can see is the one that is directly above the ballroom, but you do see something else. And just for a moment in the darkness, you think you see something moving in the snow, a large shape is impossibly as up in the air, almost as high up as you are, just moving fast through the air, a dark shape. And then it disappears. But I've lost sight of it at this point. It's dark and it's snowy.
2197.28 2214.76 speaker4  I saw a big thing up in the sky over there. It was, uh, it was, it was moving, it was moving fast, but I did, I lost sight of it. It was heading for the house. How big?
2212.76 2225.60 speaker3  of scale as it moved past.
2223.04 2258.60 speaker4  It had to have been a, you know, a boy, a boy. It was a boy. Nevermind. It was just a boy.
2253.60 2269.00 speaker2  Yeah, he's going to start investigating what Mordant was up to in here, what he can deduce that this place is for.
2267.28 2281.44 speaker3  work all this out?
2276.76 2291.40 speaker2  wires and trying to see what is connected, you know, to what device and what it might be for.
2288.80 2300.88 speaker3  If you get a hard success, I'll give you something extra. You'll learn a bit more.
2299.88 2322.76 speaker2  I will do it. Good. I forgot. Can you explain why?
2315.72 2358.52 speaker3  In pulp Cthulhu, you can survive certain death, so you could have, yeah, you could be on top of this tower. It catches fire and the, the falling structure collapses down into the forest below. you can spend all your luck in one go and survive that certain death and just narrate how you managed to get out of the situation. Okay. As soon as you have less than 30 points of luck, however, you're dead.
2356.96 2374.24 speaker2  I'm doing all right. He spends that luck.
2370.88 2405.04 speaker3  We'll see what that applies in a moment. to what that other antenna was, that electrical wiring and the antenna around here do seem to be receiving equipment for whatever is going to get transmitted from the house. up above.
2404.16 2408.88 speaker2  Sorry, what light is that?
2405.68 2468.98 speaker3  The huge lighthouse type bulb that is above your head. looking at the design and looking at the way everything is connected, there are a few smaller antennae that point out in other directions that you're fairly certain are designed to transmit, but they don't look like they're designed to transmit power. They look like maybe radio antennae, but you're not really sure. There's something about the design that looks weird even to you. And this is where you could give me a Cthulhu Mythos roll if you want. Are there penalties for fumbling? Maybe a lot of fun to be had.
2468.48 2503.68 speaker2  not right. No, I'm not going to do it. Oh, I'm sorry. We should have told Thomas not to do it. Hey, Thomas, don't do it. I'm not...
2502.32 2507.92 speaker3  work out what it is.
2507.28 2512.08 speaker2  what it is.
2508.88 2521.52 speaker4  I mean, it's a lot of that same kind of equipment you got in your place. Nothing's weird here.
2519.04 2526.56 speaker2  of science, and this is weird science.
2525.52 2531.84 speaker4  Maybe take some readings?
2528.40 2556.32 speaker2  This is more advanced than he thought Mordant was capable of. He doesn't know exactly what it is. He knows it might be cool. It's at least big. And he's like, oh, Harvey, this evening isn't going anything like I imagined. I haven't even seen Cicero or his wife.
2554.48 2570.64 speaker4  No, because there's no power at the moment.
2563.20 2579.92 speaker3  Yeah, it looks like if you're right, and that antenna on the main building transmits electrical energy, it looks like that powers everything that's up here on the tower.
2579.20 2588.16 speaker2  Probably could, yeah. Might fumble, though. It'd be cool if he did.
2587.60 2598.56 speaker3  You shouldn't... Yeah.
2594.72 2634.88 speaker2  I just know that when you mess up Mythos shit and the other versions of shit... It makes it cooler? we're still going to be able to pull it out. He was like, no, just do it. It'll be fun. Scott has built an awesome roller coaster, and I just want to strap in and ride it. Then you take a Mythos roll, bitch.
2632.72 2638.40 speaker3  you can spend luck to mitigate fumbles.
2637.92 2641.06 speaker4  Yes.
2640.56 2649.04 speaker2  All right. 24, yeah.
2647.84 2652.64 speaker5  No, no, I'm good on that.
2651.84 2658.00 speaker4  I'm okay on that.
2656.40 2660.56 speaker3  Oh, well, hmm.
2659.44 2682.80 speaker2  You think it's that important? I can't spend that much luck right now.
2680.32 2686.56 speaker5  Next episode, if you guys want to trudge out here
2686.16 2690.32 speaker4  I will.
2688.08 2692.96 speaker2  And we'll talk to the movie stars and the senators.
2692.48 2733.44 speaker3  Fuck yeah. aerials that is, for a start, very different from any of the other technology that you can see around here. But there is something that, as bizarre as it might sound to your obviously rational mad scientist mind, is that it seems...
2731.04 2736.00 speaker4  And it made a really funny sound as we lost you.
2734.16 2743.12 speaker2  You're like, as bizarre as it might sound...
2741.84 2768.96 speaker4  Am I practicing with you? Yes.
2764.32 2791.20 speaker3  You're fairly certain that the technology here, even though you may never have encountered anything like it before, is not of this Earth, and that it is designed to broadcast some kind of signal using means you can't quite identify. You think that the signal that it's sending out may even be a psychic one?
2790.16 2792.88 speaker2  Sanity check.
2792.64 2804.48 speaker4  Yeah.
2799.60 2829.12 speaker3  You are a mad scientist, you've got weird science, so I think this is in your wheelhouse. Awesome.
2825.36 2846.64 speaker2  He can't believe Mordant has built a tower. A, he has a bad feeling about what the purposes of that broadcast are, but B, he is just enraged that Cicero Mordant has built this kick-ass alien radio tower, and he is going to smash it like a child.
2845.04 2867.60 speaker4  Harvey cracks his knuckles. Say no more, boss! And comes down with a Hulk smash on the nearest console.
2864.80 2938.24 speaker3  and go back to the others in the ballroom. Mr. Ring was going to have his second pass at trying to meet the senator, and this time he is accompanied by his boss. as you're passing through? where you do hear that phrase being repeated that you heard a few months ago. It's going to change the world, you know.
