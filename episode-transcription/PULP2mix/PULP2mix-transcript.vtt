00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
Hello to all my friends from the underworld, the overworld, and the in-between world.

00:09.240 --> 00:17.040
It's your multi-dimensional devilish demon wolf the dog, and I'm also a radio DJ for

00:17.040 --> 00:24.240
the station we all know and love, 694.2 PTBP.

00:24.240 --> 00:32.000
And I'm here to provide you with ear cream in the form of my beautiful soul tree voice.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.080
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is the cream of the ear crop, and it's from TLN in Kansas

00:38.080 --> 00:44.840
City, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a nice thing you can do

00:44.840 --> 00:48.360
right now, like super easily.

00:48.360 --> 00:52.360
Thanks TLN in Kansas City, TLN writes.

00:52.480 --> 00:58.840
Hello wolf, and thank you for the ceaseless howlin', keepin' me company upon these

00:58.840 --> 01:00.400
dayless moors.

01:00.400 --> 01:08.080
TLN here from Kansas City to give a shout out to the very vilest viziers whose creative

01:08.080 --> 01:12.960
powers have wrought upon this world great and terrible things.

01:12.960 --> 01:21.120
Because of you we have unleashed the weird and wild, the book of gob, the thawing kingdom,

01:21.160 --> 01:28.320
marvelous mutations and merry musicians, and very soon the world shall behold the dreadful

01:28.320 --> 01:33.120
sunny smiles unicorn farm and unicorn meat.

01:33.120 --> 01:39.600
May the pig king remain at rest, may the seven finger hand reach to the ends of the earth,

01:39.600 --> 01:42.640
long live the vile viziers.

01:42.640 --> 01:47.400
Damn TLN, you had me at unicorn meat.

01:47.400 --> 01:54.200
I generally consider myself a vegetarian, but I dabble in some minced mythical meat

01:54.200 --> 01:56.200
every now and again.

01:56.200 --> 02:02.600
Thanks for writing whatever the fuck all that was TLN, I appreciate it, even if I don't

02:02.600 --> 02:06.320
know what in the ever lovin' fuck any of it meant.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.840
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag us on the internet or write

02:10.840 --> 02:14.360
up a five star review on Apple podcasts.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.560
The links are in the show notes.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.440
The sausage links are in the gross throats.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.880
On the golf links I have the most strokes.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.920
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg it's time for the news.

02:25.920 --> 02:32.280
Last time we met the disguised Lafayette J. Honeycutt, a rival inventor who has snuck

02:32.280 --> 02:39.960
into Cicero Mordaunt's New Year's Eve party to unveil his own mysterious invention with

02:39.960 --> 02:46.380
his security detail Harvey Brewer, an absolute hulk of a man.

02:46.380 --> 02:53.680
We also met Checkers, the oddly deep voiced 19 year old leader of the Last Branch, a cult

02:53.680 --> 03:00.400
hoping to recruit the wealthy and powerful with the disarming charm of Checkers and the

03:00.400 --> 03:07.720
spiritual potential of Elden Ring, an open vessel seeking otherworldly knowledge.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.520
Will the Last Branch gain a key third member?

03:11.520 --> 03:20.200
Will Honey J. Laugh-a-cut, aka James Dean, aka Dave Ellington, figure out what the deal

03:20.200 --> 03:27.720
is with Cicero Mordaunt's new invention that requires all these cables and antennae?

03:27.720 --> 03:33.120
Will Scott admit that Elden Ring is a perfect character name?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.860
Come on down.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.780
No one sane will follow.

03:37.780 --> 03:43.620
It's the renowned Isabel Crane with Hollow.

04:04.860 --> 04:19.820
With a tissue and a faggot bone You were hollow and you spoke to me

04:19.820 --> 04:33.380
Hollow and you sang I thought you might be starving

04:33.380 --> 04:43.220
So I gave you everything

04:43.220 --> 04:46.700
Did you like that, Scott?

04:46.700 --> 04:51.860
I think it helps focus the mind before a session, so yeah.

04:51.860 --> 04:55.740
We try to do a lot of stuff that helps focus the mind before a session.

04:55.740 --> 04:59.740
What do you do, Luke, to get into the mindset of a role-playing session?

04:59.740 --> 05:04.580
Wake up, roll out of bed, and sit down on the couch.

05:04.580 --> 05:08.540
What about you, Scott?

05:08.540 --> 05:09.540
Maybe a different answer?

05:09.540 --> 05:14.980
No, that's pretty much it for me.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.540
I don't do any prep for anything.

05:16.540 --> 05:24.020
I mean, if I'm GM, you're lucky if I read the fucking scenario.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.940
I'm so jealous of your skills.

05:26.940 --> 05:33.260
I over-prep so hard for everything, and I talk to myself in character voices, and my

05:33.260 --> 05:41.300
wife asks me how I'm doing, and I'm like, fine.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.980
I worked out a while back that I was absolutely shit at character voices, so I don't really

05:44.980 --> 05:47.300
try them anymore.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.260
I feel like you give them vocal affectations even though you don't do accents.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.540
Yeah, I try.

05:53.540 --> 05:58.100
I don't try full voices, but I try to differentiate them a bit.

05:58.100 --> 06:04.700
Also, for us, you already have a built-in character voice.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.700
But it's the wrong fucking accent for everything I've run for.

06:08.700 --> 06:14.260
Hey, Scott, will you run some stuff that's only set in America for us?

06:14.260 --> 06:18.180
No, the next one is he's going to force us to do English accents.

06:18.180 --> 06:21.340
The next time, we'll all do English accents.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.340
Oh, God.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.340
Hey, Scott, would you like an accent?

06:23.340 --> 06:27.260
That would be so much less fun for him.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.340
It'll just be Beatles and Cockney accents.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.340
Yeah, that's cool.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.340
We're the Beatles.

06:31.340 --> 06:36.780
It's taking me something like 30 years of living in England to get the hang of this

06:36.780 --> 06:37.780
already.

06:37.780 --> 06:38.780
Don't confuse me.

06:38.780 --> 06:40.780
I'm Ringo, isn't it?

06:40.780 --> 06:42.780
Is that good?

06:42.780 --> 06:43.780
Wow.

06:43.780 --> 06:44.780
Yep.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.780
There we go.

06:46.780 --> 06:52.220
Well, we were talking weird science.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.100
What's your favorite weird science movie, Thomas?

06:54.100 --> 06:56.540
Oh, I like that movie, Weird Science.

06:56.540 --> 06:57.540
RDJ?

06:57.540 --> 07:01.960
What's the Val Kilmer, is it Young Genius?

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
Real Genius?

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
Yeah.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
Something like that.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
Real Genius.

07:05.960 --> 07:06.960
Real Genius.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.960
Yeah.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.960
I like that one.

07:08.960 --> 07:09.960
Oh, God.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
I haven't thought about that film since the 90s.

07:10.960 --> 07:11.960
Why do you know it, Joe?

07:11.960 --> 07:15.460
It was one of those movies that would run on HBO when I was a kid.

07:15.460 --> 07:19.820
It's just perfectly childish enough that I was into it.

07:19.820 --> 07:20.820
Yeah.

07:20.820 --> 07:24.100
Did you know that your parents letting you watch HBO at a young age made you who you

07:24.100 --> 07:25.100
are today?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.100
Yeah.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.100
Definitely.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.220
Did you ever see boobies on there?

07:28.220 --> 07:29.780
Taxi cab confessions all the time.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.780
That's why I am the way I am.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.780
Obsessed with boobies.

07:35.780 --> 07:38.820
Were there nipples on taxi cab confessions?

07:38.820 --> 07:42.700
Sometimes, if you were lucky, if it was a good episode.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.820
You know, if the driver was shirtless.

07:46.820 --> 07:55.060
Scott, when you were coming up, what was the thing that was scandalous that you hid

07:55.060 --> 07:58.500
from your parents that you were looking at?

07:58.500 --> 07:59.940
Oh, God.

07:59.940 --> 08:06.240
Oh, this has got to be a deep cut and very obscure, but I think the inappropriate media

08:06.240 --> 08:12.040
that I encountered at a fairly young age that shaped me and my parents really didn't like

08:12.040 --> 08:17.520
when they encountered it was a book called Image of the Beast by Philip Jose Farmer,

08:17.520 --> 08:24.860
which is a science fiction novel come sort of new Irish thing that was published in the

08:24.860 --> 08:27.460
60s or 70s.

08:27.460 --> 08:37.200
And it is basically just somewhere between bizarro fiction and outright pornography.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.060
It's one of the weirdest books ever written.

08:39.060 --> 08:45.600
It is insanely on brand for that to be a fact.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.520
To give you an example of the kind of book it is.

08:48.520 --> 08:54.100
One of the characters in this is Gilles de Rais, AKA Bluebeard, but it's not the classic

08:54.100 --> 08:55.100
Gilles de Rais.

08:55.100 --> 09:01.760
He's been reincarnated and he now lives as this snake-like entity living in the womb

09:01.760 --> 09:04.480
of one of the female characters.

09:04.480 --> 09:10.480
And his shtick basically is every time she has sex with anyone, he comes out and just

09:10.480 --> 09:14.880
bites the cock of the person who's having sex with her and kills him.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.920
Oh my God, that's great.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.920
Well thanks a lot, Scott.

09:18.920 --> 09:23.680
I didn't need to know I was into that too.

09:23.680 --> 09:29.860
I had a VHS of Double Jeopardy and there's a sex scene in that movie and I would just

09:29.860 --> 09:30.860
watch that.

09:31.260 --> 09:36.180
I thought you meant like you had taped an episode of Jeopardy and you're like, there's

09:36.180 --> 09:37.900
a sex scene in this Jeopardy.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.620
I was just thinking, I don't remember Trebek ever working with me.

09:41.620 --> 09:44.020
This was Tommy Lee Jones.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.020
Let's go to...

09:45.020 --> 09:47.660
I'm like, Joe, I didn't have to hide anything really.

09:47.660 --> 09:51.040
So my parents exposed me to a ton of media and stuff.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.260
They were separated, so my dad was a little more permissive about what I got to watch.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.340
Well, like a lot more permissive.

10:00.340 --> 10:04.900
And so South Park came out in 1996, I think.

10:04.900 --> 10:05.900
Oh my God.

10:05.900 --> 10:06.900
I was...

10:06.900 --> 10:07.900
30?

10:07.900 --> 10:08.900
I was 30, yeah.

10:08.900 --> 10:13.300
I was seven years old and my dad was like, hey, there's this show I think you're going

10:13.300 --> 10:19.620
to really like, but you can't tell your mom you watch it when you're over here.

10:19.620 --> 10:24.180
And so for a few years, South Park was a secret, but that was literally the only thing I had

10:24.180 --> 10:26.460
to not tell one of my parents about.

10:26.460 --> 10:31.420
When I was six years old, my mom also said the same thing to me, hey, there's this show

10:31.420 --> 10:33.900
that's coming out and I think you're going to like it.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.900
It's called VeggieTales.

10:34.900 --> 10:35.900
It's Pokemon.

10:35.900 --> 10:40.900
I thought you were going to say the Left Behind movies.

10:40.900 --> 10:46.240
I did read all the Left Behind books and it gave me night terrors.

10:46.240 --> 10:51.160
And so in order to fix me, my parents prayed for me.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.160
It didn't work.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.500
It was just anxiety, guys.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.820
It was just anxiety the whole time.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.260
Yeah.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.260
Oh my God.

10:58.260 --> 10:59.260
Religion.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.260
Religion.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.260
It's a hell of a drug.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.460
Let's do some lines.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.460
It's pretending to be people.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.060
I Googled it and I was eight when South Park came out.

11:08.060 --> 11:09.540
Oh wow.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.500
That is young to watch South Park.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
I was probably nine by the time he showed it to me.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.980
I'd already been watching The Simpsons since I was literally born and I was obsessed with

11:17.980 --> 11:18.980
it.

11:18.980 --> 11:22.020
And he was like, if you like The Simpsons, you're going to fucking love this shit.

11:22.020 --> 11:27.180
I'm not going to say how old I was when South Park came out.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.660
I was four years old.

11:28.660 --> 11:29.660
Oh fuck.

11:29.660 --> 11:33.940
I was 32.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.380
You'd already lived so much life, Scott.

11:36.380 --> 11:37.740
So how did South Park hit you?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.220
All right, let's kick into...

11:40.220 --> 11:41.220
Appropriately.

11:41.220 --> 11:42.220
Yeah.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.700
The target demographic.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.820
All right.

11:48.820 --> 11:56.820
Last time on Pretending to be People, we played Colputhulu.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.820
Colputhulu.

11:58.820 --> 12:00.540
Colputhulu.

12:00.540 --> 12:01.540
Actually the P is silent.

12:01.540 --> 12:04.740
It's just Thulu.

12:04.740 --> 12:09.180
We introduced our characters and made it to the party and kind of got acquainted with

12:09.180 --> 12:11.340
the goings on of what's happening at the party.

12:11.340 --> 12:14.380
Can we give a quick rundown of our names and our characters real quick?

12:14.380 --> 12:15.380
Thomas?

12:16.060 --> 12:18.540
Jay Honeycutt, a gentleman inventor.

12:18.540 --> 12:23.820
I'm Harvey Brewer and I'm here to protect him and make sure nothing happens to him.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.860
Checkers, leader of a fantastic organization.

12:26.860 --> 12:33.020
It's a cult and I'm Elden Ring and we're trying to change the world through the powers that

12:33.020 --> 12:36.180
exist between mind spaces.

12:36.180 --> 12:39.020
We got government officials, we got...

12:39.020 --> 12:43.180
We're going to bag ourselves a senator and a movie lady.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.180
Star of...

12:44.180 --> 12:45.180
Favorite movie she was in.

12:45.180 --> 12:48.500
Oh, probably Last Train to Jacksonville.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.500
Clarksville.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
Nope.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
She did a whole series.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Last Train series.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.260
Yeah, they're some of my favorites.

12:55.260 --> 13:01.220
I like the rom-com First Train to Love Town.

13:01.220 --> 13:10.220
And yeah, we went to the party and currently I believe Thomas, Jay, Edgar, Honeyfella and...

13:10.220 --> 13:12.140
What is your guy going by here at the party?

13:12.140 --> 13:13.260
David Ellington.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.340
David Ellington.

13:14.340 --> 13:18.700
David Ellington and Harvey Brewer are checking out the radio antennas that are strangely

13:18.700 --> 13:23.620
sticking out of kind of like the front of the house and also the tower that seems to

13:23.620 --> 13:25.500
have been built outside of this estate.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.460
Yeah, I think we're turning around to pick up our coats from Kochek.

13:28.460 --> 13:29.460
Yeah.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.420
You guys are going back out in the cold.

13:31.420 --> 13:36.020
I'm standing in the warm about to talk to a senator about the world.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.660
I think that's a good point to pick up from.

13:37.660 --> 13:38.660
Yeah.

13:38.660 --> 13:39.660
There we go.

13:40.060 --> 13:46.860
Eldon was making his way through the crowd.

13:46.860 --> 13:50.580
Say the last name, Scott.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.540
I like to go by first hand last names.

13:53.540 --> 13:57.660
Brought to you by From Software.

13:57.660 --> 14:00.380
Mr. Ring was making his way through the crowd.

14:00.380 --> 14:01.380
Oh, get it?

14:01.380 --> 14:04.860
Because it's like mystery, but it's also my name.

14:04.860 --> 14:05.860
What is your name?

14:05.860 --> 14:06.860
Sekiro.

14:06.860 --> 14:07.860
Halo 3.

14:08.060 --> 14:16.460
So, yes, Mr. Ring is making his way through the crowd, trying to home in on the senator.

14:16.460 --> 14:21.980
But before you get a chance to, there is a woman who's been making her way through the

14:21.980 --> 14:22.980
crowd as well.

14:22.980 --> 14:27.340
I think she's, you reckon, probably in her mid 40s.

14:27.340 --> 14:29.900
She's got fairly frizzy reddish brown hair.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.500
She's got thick glasses on.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.740
She's wearing a bald gown that doesn't quite fit.

14:35.740 --> 14:39.700
Like a number of the guests here, she looks a bit flushed and drunk.

14:39.700 --> 14:43.980
She just comes up to you and grabs you by the hand and says, you look like a dancer

14:43.980 --> 14:47.180
and immediately sort of whisks you off and starts dancing with you.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.840
Well, yes, thank you so much for that.

14:49.840 --> 14:56.140
And he begins dancing with her and says, you look absolutely wonderful.

14:56.140 --> 14:57.140
Oh, thank you.

14:57.140 --> 15:00.060
Oh, you are a darling little man, she says.

15:00.060 --> 15:01.060
Oh, yeah.

15:01.060 --> 15:04.340
He's looking up to her as they're dancing.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.340
His feet are on her feet, like.

15:06.340 --> 15:12.980
Yeah, you got a good view straight up at her buck teeth and nasal hair.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.260
And she's swinging you through the crowd.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.580
What brought you here this evening, my dear madam?

15:18.580 --> 15:22.220
Oh, I'm here with the Harvard contingent, you know.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.820
Oh, very good.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.340
Are you expecting much from the party tonight?

15:26.340 --> 15:28.340
Not really, no.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.660
Champagne, the occasional dance.

15:30.660 --> 15:31.660
Psychic attack!

15:31.660 --> 15:32.660
Psychic attack!

15:32.660 --> 15:33.660
Psychic attack!

15:43.340 --> 15:45.140
How does the psychic attack work?

15:45.140 --> 15:46.140
What is the...

15:46.140 --> 15:48.660
Did you just perform a psychic attack?

15:53.340 --> 15:58.860
Scott, Zach had his hand raised for a psychic attack.

15:58.860 --> 15:59.860
He thought it so loud.

15:59.860 --> 16:06.060
So you tell me if I'm wrong here, but I believe we roll a power contest against each other.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.060
Yeah.

16:07.060 --> 16:10.660
So is your goal basically just to get it to go away at this stage?

16:10.660 --> 16:11.660
No.

16:11.660 --> 16:19.620
So my goal is to continue dancing with her while basically intimidating her into continuing

16:19.620 --> 16:26.560
dancing with me while I completely eliminate all of her magic points and she comes under

16:26.560 --> 16:27.560
my thrall.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.060
Is this how you get cult members?

16:29.060 --> 16:30.060
Yes.

16:30.060 --> 16:31.060
Holy shit.

16:31.060 --> 16:38.260
So yeah, then give me a power roll, I shall roll against you as an opposed roll.

16:38.260 --> 16:42.780
Well I passed with a 62 under a 90.

16:42.780 --> 16:44.260
Regular success.

16:44.260 --> 16:49.380
So if you psychic attack me at some point, we'll be doing a power roll off?

16:49.380 --> 16:53.060
Yeah but I'm trying, I don't want to psychic attack you.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.060
Okay, she failed.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.060
Oh, sick.

16:57.060 --> 17:05.060
Well, you say that, but there's something weird that happens when you do this.

17:05.060 --> 17:12.900
I mean you basically use the tricks that you've honed to try to take control of her mind and

17:12.900 --> 17:19.160
you realize as you're doing this, someone's beaten you to it.

17:19.160 --> 17:24.940
You're trying to grasp hold of her will, but it's like it's already in the thrall of something

17:24.940 --> 17:26.240
else.

17:26.240 --> 17:30.600
You could give me, I'd say, another power roll here to see whether you can deduce what's

17:30.600 --> 17:32.360
going on.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.360
That is a success.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.360
59 under 90.

17:34.360 --> 17:40.320
Yes, as you try to grab hold of her mind with yours, you're looking into the darkness.

17:40.320 --> 17:44.600
You're looking into the darkness that is enveloping her mind.

17:44.600 --> 17:51.520
Try to find something, anything to hold onto and there is something in the darkness there

17:51.520 --> 17:53.480
with you.

17:53.480 --> 18:01.240
You can just hear this growling voice from all around, this sibilant growling voice that

18:01.240 --> 18:04.240
just says, mine.

18:04.240 --> 18:09.000
Give me a sand roll if you want.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.880
I got chills a little bit.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.920
I will absolutely give you a sand roll, fuck.

18:13.920 --> 18:18.400
Yeah, in real life I lost sand.

18:18.400 --> 18:24.520
So as far as sanity goes, I have 90 because my power and I rolled a 63.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.480
Okay, so you don't lose any sand for this, but it probably still gives you enough of

18:29.480 --> 18:39.960
a start that it breaks you out of the psychic trance that you were going into to do this.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.720
The woman looks at you strangely and says, are you all right?

18:43.720 --> 18:46.640
Yes, ma'am, what is your deepest desire?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.280
I thought you were going to say, what's your deal?

18:49.280 --> 18:52.280
What's your deal?

18:52.280 --> 18:55.200
She looks at you strangely, my deepest desire.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.880
Oh, I suppose I really want to see Cicero's invention.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.040
I want to see it succeed in every way possible.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.680
It's got to change the world, you know.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.680
Interesting.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.200
Do I also believe that?

19:07.200 --> 19:09.360
Um, up to you.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.560
Sounds like it already has.

19:11.560 --> 19:16.360
Ma'am, tell me anything more that you know about this wonderful invention that will change

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
the world.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.080
I too am interested in learning about these things.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.320
Oh, yeah, of course you are.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.480
I mean, it's going to be the most wonderful thing ever.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.080
It's got to change the world, you know.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
Yes.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.080
What will it do?

19:27.080 --> 19:29.480
It's got to change the world.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.920
Incredible.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.600
Everyone here has been brainwashed.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.600
Okay.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.560
Uh, he is going to go back in.

19:37.560 --> 19:41.360
He's going to try to like get in and then fucking fight.

19:41.360 --> 19:45.120
Like once he's in her mind space, he wants to punch up.

19:45.120 --> 19:51.760
Oh, so what are you effectively trying to use her as a conduit to get to whatever has

19:51.760 --> 19:52.760
got to her first?

19:52.760 --> 19:56.720
Yeah, I'm playing, uh, what's that lawn game with the balls?

19:56.720 --> 19:57.720
Croquet?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.920
Yep, I'm using her as the, uh-

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
You're playing psychic croquet.

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
Yep.

20:02.920 --> 20:08.200
I prefer psychic curling.

20:08.200 --> 20:12.720
Psychic croquet sounds amazing, but how are you playing psychic croquet with her?

20:12.720 --> 20:16.960
Okay, so you know when one of your croquet balls gets up against somebody else's croquet

20:16.960 --> 20:22.080
ball, so then you put your foot on your croquet ball and smack it and then it shoots theirs

20:22.080 --> 20:23.480
off in a crazy direction.

20:23.480 --> 20:29.000
I'm smacking her and the point is to make the movement happen on the other side of her.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I like this.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
You make that work.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
I do like that.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah, I like that a lot.

20:33.000 --> 20:38.600
Just as an aside, I'm pretty sure I saw psychic croquet open for Hawke when she needed it.

20:38.600 --> 20:46.960
Psychic croquet, holy shit.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.560
So I rolled power again and I got an aught 5.

20:49.560 --> 20:53.320
Okay, let's see what your opponent gets here.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.800
So you've got an extreme.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
Yes.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.800
I see him.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.560
I think that might help me with my double jump up to punch this guy's butt with his

21:00.560 --> 21:04.700
mind in his space, he's a silly goose, he doesn't know who he's messing with, he's messing

21:04.700 --> 21:06.100
with Elden Ring.

21:06.100 --> 21:10.940
He's got an extreme as well and his power is significantly higher than yours.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.340
Oh, damn.

21:12.340 --> 21:20.860
This time you're in her mind trying to shunt through to this other mind and it's almost

21:20.860 --> 21:26.800
like there's no resistance and yeah, you can push through her mind and connect with this

21:26.800 --> 21:28.860
thing that's on the other side.

21:28.860 --> 21:34.740
And then you realize this only happened because it let you.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.780
And suddenly you feel like a rat in a trap.

21:38.780 --> 21:42.780
I'm in danger.

21:42.780 --> 21:48.140
There is something that has just seized hold of your psyche and I mean, even if you want

21:48.140 --> 21:50.200
to try to pull your mind back, you can.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.200
Checkers, where's checkers?

21:51.200 --> 21:57.680
Yeah, as this is happening, I come out of the bathroom and I am coked up and had slammed

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
like three drinks.

21:58.680 --> 22:03.400
So I'm feeling pretty wild, but I see him dancing and not talking to the senator and

22:03.400 --> 22:04.680
I am not very happy about that.

22:05.120 --> 22:10.420
Not only dancing, but I read in the book that if you fail these checks or if someone is

22:10.420 --> 22:15.540
looking and paying attention to the face during a psychic attack, they're contorted in pain

22:15.540 --> 22:16.540
and confusion.

22:16.540 --> 22:24.200
Oh, it's worse than that here because what checkers sees as he comes back from the bathroom

22:24.200 --> 22:31.860
is that Mr. Ring has broken off from the dance.

22:31.860 --> 22:37.400
The woman who was leading him through the crowd now seems to be standing over him.

22:37.400 --> 22:43.000
You see Eldon just fall to the ground with a heavy thump and she's standing over.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.280
Are you all right, mister?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.200
And at least you think that's what she's saying.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.560
You could barely hear her over the band.

22:49.560 --> 22:55.080
And there are a few other people who've stopped their conversation and now gathering around.

22:55.080 --> 23:00.800
Yeah, there's Eldon lying on the ground, his eyes rolled back into his head.

23:00.800 --> 23:06.700
As I see this, I approach, I'm like, everybody stand back.

23:06.700 --> 23:10.800
And I pull out like a little vial from my pocket.

23:10.800 --> 23:11.800
It's like smelling salts.

23:11.800 --> 23:16.020
I like put it under his nose like this happens all this has happened before for sure.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.020
And I'm like prepared.

23:17.020 --> 23:21.340
I'm going to have that because I have the resourceful talent.

23:21.340 --> 23:22.340
Oh, nice.

23:22.340 --> 23:23.340
Sure.

23:23.340 --> 23:24.340
Oh yeah.

23:24.340 --> 23:25.740
If you want to spend 10 points of luck for that, that's perfect.

23:25.740 --> 23:32.760
I would, uh, I'll just not spin the points.

23:32.760 --> 23:37.320
I know I can do that, but yeah, I want to do that and basically like snap him out of

23:37.320 --> 23:38.320
it.

23:38.320 --> 23:43.400
And as you do so, I mean, there is a hand that comes down on your shoulder and as you

23:43.400 --> 23:50.000
look around, you can see that there is this clergyman who you've seen moving through the

23:50.000 --> 23:55.660
crowd before when he's got a fairly thin face and graying temples, he almost chiseled

23:55.660 --> 23:57.340
good looks.

23:57.340 --> 24:03.580
He gives you a concerned look looking down at Eldon as well and says, uh, is your friend

24:03.580 --> 24:05.140
quite all right there?

24:05.140 --> 24:10.500
He's got a very sort of cut glass English accent says something I can do to help.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.700
It happens all the time.

24:11.700 --> 24:16.700
He's got a condition, but this bad boy right here usually snaps him right out of it.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.140
Oh, well I suppose you better do that then.

24:19.280 --> 24:26.600
Uh, yeah, so I, I smell salt Eldon, uh, and I'm like, but like, I'm like looking at the

24:26.600 --> 24:34.300
clergy guy while I'm doing it mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, Eldon.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.300
What happened?

24:35.300 --> 24:37.340
I mean, actually, no, you have a condition.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.600
This happens all the time.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.760
Don't tell me what happened right here in front of this guy.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Yes.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.800
Perhaps we better get your friends somewhere quiet.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.800
Who are you by the way?

24:46.800 --> 24:47.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.080
That's terribly rude of me.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.080
I'm Reverend Nye.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.260
I earned this whole deal.

24:53.260 --> 24:54.260
Thank you, Reverend.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.260
Uh, Reverend Nye.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.260
Is it Bill Nye?

24:56.260 --> 24:57.260
Is it Bill Nye?

24:57.260 --> 24:59.100
Uh, Reverend, thank you.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.900
I think Eldon, are you good?

25:00.900 --> 25:05.320
I think I don't know that I want to be isolated at the party unless you feel like you need

25:05.320 --> 25:06.320
it.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.140
I'm sure we can find somewhere quiet just for him to recover his senses.

25:10.140 --> 25:16.520
He gestures at one of the serving staff who's going past and just says some water for this

25:16.520 --> 25:17.820
young man here.

25:17.840 --> 25:21.040
Thank you, Reverend Man of the Cloth, sir.

25:21.040 --> 25:26.280
I would like to look into his eyes and try to get a read on him.

25:26.280 --> 25:30.880
Yeah, I was going to say, is there like a human type, uh, skill?

25:30.880 --> 25:31.880
That's psychology.

25:31.880 --> 25:32.880
Psychology.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.880
Perfect.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.480
Can I psychology this guy to see why he's trying to isolate us?

25:36.480 --> 25:37.480
Sure.

25:37.480 --> 25:38.480
Yeah.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.480
38 on a 60.

25:40.480 --> 25:41.480
Okay.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.380
It's going to have to be a hard success, so you'd have to spend eight points of luck to

25:44.380 --> 25:45.380
make that.

25:45.380 --> 25:46.380
Do it.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.380
Let's do it.

25:47.940 --> 25:48.940
Minus 18.

25:48.940 --> 25:49.940
Yeah.

25:49.940 --> 25:53.540
I went down 10 for the smelling salts and now I am at 32.

25:53.540 --> 26:02.020
There is something about his manner for all the urbaneness that strikes you as being terribly

26:02.020 --> 26:03.340
predatory.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.500
Master Checkers, should I trust this man?

26:05.500 --> 26:13.380
Well, we always trust men of the cloth, but it's a party, so sorry, but no rest tonight.

26:13.380 --> 26:14.380
That's right.

26:14.380 --> 26:15.380
Sorry.

26:15.380 --> 26:16.380
It's a party.

26:17.380 --> 26:27.660
And, uh, I, I help Eldon up off the ground, miss, uh, Reverend I nice to meet, nice to

26:27.660 --> 26:28.660
meet you.

26:28.660 --> 26:32.420
Maybe we can catch up later, but we've got an important business to attend to and I kind

26:32.420 --> 26:34.260
of gesture towards the Senator.

26:34.260 --> 26:40.020
He smiles at you and says, of course, of course, but we must talk later.

26:40.020 --> 26:43.020
I'm sure we have great things to discuss.

26:43.180 --> 26:48.540
Well, if you read this, uh, you know, you'll, you'll know what I'll be wanting to talk about

26:48.540 --> 26:49.540
later.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.220
And I hand him one of my pamphlets.

26:51.220 --> 26:56.780
He takes it and immediately scans it and flicks through it and says, oh, how wonderfully droll.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.480
And then tucks it into his pocket.

26:59.480 --> 27:04.340
Checkers is coked up and he has just created a shit list and this guy is at the top of

27:04.340 --> 27:08.140
it.

27:08.140 --> 27:17.340
Before you lead Mr. Ring away from the Reverend, Eldon can give me a SPOT HIDDEN, if...

27:17.340 --> 27:18.700
74 on a 25.

27:18.700 --> 27:24.500
So you lead Eldon away from the Reverend who turns around and starts making small talk

27:24.500 --> 27:25.500
with someone else.

27:25.500 --> 27:26.500
Okay.

27:26.500 --> 27:30.740
And yeah, we'll, we'll head towards the Senator Billings.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.580
Okay.

27:32.580 --> 27:35.060
So we'll come back to you in a few moments.

27:35.060 --> 27:40.340
Let's cut back to our scientific investigation team outside.

27:40.340 --> 27:42.540
Newly, newly outfitted in their coats.

27:42.540 --> 27:43.540
Okay.

27:43.540 --> 27:48.580
So you've gone back inside, you've managed to get some coats, uh, they might even be

27:48.580 --> 27:49.580
your own.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.580
Their tongues have warmed up to body temp again.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.580
You're right.

27:52.580 --> 27:56.580
We found some, we got some better coats.

27:56.580 --> 27:58.580
Does this look good on me?

27:58.580 --> 28:03.220
Um, so yeah, we are, we are trudging back.

28:03.220 --> 28:06.580
Lafayette wants to go see this tower.

28:06.580 --> 28:07.580
Come along, Avi.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.140
We've, we've got to get to the bottom of this.

28:09.140 --> 28:13.140
Uh, and I believe the bottom of this is at the top of that tower.

28:13.140 --> 28:14.140
I get it.

28:14.140 --> 28:15.140
I get it.

28:15.140 --> 28:17.580
You're saying that this thing points at that thing, so it must be related there.

28:17.580 --> 28:23.300
You know, my last several men were much dumber than you and they didn't appreciate my wit.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.380
And so you're, you're a delight, Avi.

28:25.380 --> 28:26.860
It is a delight to have you along.

28:26.860 --> 28:28.340
Well, I've got your back.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.620
Well, I, well, I got your back.

28:30.620 --> 28:31.620
There it is.

28:31.620 --> 28:32.620
There it is.

28:33.020 --> 28:34.020
It's easy to do.

28:34.020 --> 28:38.020
Now, now forward, Avi, for science.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.020
Yeah, we're, we're making our way to that tower.

28:40.020 --> 28:47.020
Making our way to the tower, walking slow cause it's snowing and cold.

28:47.020 --> 28:50.340
You mentioned, you mentioned to think of it as kind of like a watchtower.

28:50.340 --> 28:54.300
Is there forestry around it or is it kind of standing on its own in a field?

28:54.300 --> 28:59.900
It's standing on the edge of this plateau that makes up the, the compound, the sort

28:59.900 --> 29:04.020
of grounds of the manor house and the outbuildings.

29:04.020 --> 29:08.380
So it does overlook some woodland, but it's not actually in the woodland.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.380
Gotcha.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.380
Sure.

29:10.380 --> 29:14.540
When you get up to the top of it, is it like one that kind of has like a like porch around

29:14.540 --> 29:18.860
the outside and you like walk through a door into a building or is it just like open on

29:18.860 --> 29:19.860
the top?

29:19.860 --> 29:25.020
Well, you're going to have to, I think, get a bit closer to really see the top of it.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.020
Luke's trying to fast forward.

29:27.700 --> 29:32.780
Yeah, because it's now snowing so heavily that even by the time you get to the bottom

29:32.780 --> 29:37.940
of it, the top of it in the darkness and the snow isn't really visible.

29:37.940 --> 29:42.200
There is a ladder that goes up to the center of it.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.460
So there's not stairs.

29:43.460 --> 29:45.940
It's just like a ladder that goes up to, okay.

29:45.940 --> 29:49.900
I don't want to ruin the reveal, but if we used my invention right now, we sure could

29:49.900 --> 29:50.900
get there a lot faster.

29:50.900 --> 29:53.240
And it gives Harvey a knowing, like wink.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.420
Does Harvey know what's in the case?

29:54.420 --> 29:55.420
He does.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.220
I'm going to show you, Joe, but I have it written down.

29:57.220 --> 29:58.220
I just hadn't had the moment to-

29:58.220 --> 29:59.220
Does Scott know?

29:59.220 --> 30:00.220
No, Scott doesn't know.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.220
Nope.

30:01.220 --> 30:03.220
I am a quiver with anticipation.

30:03.220 --> 30:05.220
Scott doesn't know.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.220
Don't tell Scott.

30:07.220 --> 30:14.140
No, it's just, I took the gadget talent and chose this gadget.

30:14.140 --> 30:19.420
Cicero Mordant is going to eat fucking crow when he sees my cool ass gadget.

30:19.420 --> 30:24.780
Oh, you hypnotized a bunch of fucking assholes at your mansion?

30:24.780 --> 30:28.060
Well, I can't say anymore, but you'll see.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.780
I think he can fly.

30:29.780 --> 30:33.220
I gathered some sort of levitation device.

30:33.220 --> 30:34.220
Levitation device?

30:34.220 --> 30:35.220
No.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.980
Are you guys coming louder or what?

30:37.980 --> 30:40.460
So were you, yeah, was that what you were intimating?

30:40.460 --> 30:42.540
Is it we're going to use it or we're not?

30:42.540 --> 30:43.540
No.

30:43.540 --> 30:44.540
Gotcha.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.740
It's not at the time, Harvey, but so they keep trudging on through the snow towards

30:47.740 --> 30:48.740
that tower.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.540
And you mentioned some outbuildings.

30:50.540 --> 30:55.780
Are they like a groundskeeper's house or is it more like industry, like science-y?

30:55.780 --> 31:00.580
No, I mean, that said, I mean, you do know that there is an outbuilding around the back

31:00.580 --> 31:05.980
of the manor house, which is Mordant's laboratory.

31:05.980 --> 31:14.980
But the ones that you're passing on your way to the tower, there's some old stables, there's

31:14.980 --> 31:21.580
some garages, there's this building, which, yeah, maybe a groundskeeper's cottage or something

31:21.580 --> 31:25.900
like that, where there does seem to be a party going on for the chauffeurs.

31:25.900 --> 31:29.020
None of it is necessarily related to the weird science.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.580
No, not that you can see.

31:30.580 --> 31:35.820
I mean, the only building that you can think of that might have anything to do with that

31:35.820 --> 31:38.540
is Mordant's laboratory, but you haven't been there yet.

31:38.540 --> 31:42.580
Well, I mean, this time, but that is where I fucked his wife.

31:42.580 --> 31:43.580
Jesus.

31:43.580 --> 31:47.740
Yeah, he hates me.

31:47.740 --> 31:51.820
At the bottom of this tower, is there any of that stuff that we can see on top?

31:51.820 --> 31:54.700
Are there wires or anything coming down the legs of the tower?

31:54.700 --> 31:57.660
There are no wires down here.

31:57.660 --> 32:04.820
It is basically just a wooden frame with some metal supports and a ladder going up.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.060
The ladder is slightly iced over, but as long as you're careful going up and down, you should

32:09.060 --> 32:10.060
be fine.

32:10.060 --> 32:14.020
Keep your tongue away from it.

32:14.020 --> 32:16.220
You don't have to lick everyone.

32:16.220 --> 32:17.220
I vote we go up.

32:17.220 --> 32:23.500
I thought you were going to say, I vote we lick everyone.

32:23.500 --> 32:29.700
Yeah, I'm sorry.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.420
I was imagining we're licking everyone.

32:32.420 --> 32:39.980
Okay, so yeah, Harvey, actually, no, Lafayette definitely orders Harvey up there first.

32:39.980 --> 32:43.380
Yeah, for sure, I'll start climbing up.

32:43.380 --> 32:44.380
Okay.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.420
Yeah, you make your way up and it is about a hundred feet tall.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.780
Harvey looks down and goes, yep, most of them are cold.

32:50.780 --> 32:56.900
Oh, do, do, hurry, do hurry, Harvey, and then throw down a rope.

32:56.900 --> 33:00.380
Seems more difficult.

33:00.380 --> 33:06.220
The higher you get, the more aware you are of how strong the wind is as the snowstorm

33:06.220 --> 33:09.380
is building up and the snow is getting quite heavy.

33:09.380 --> 33:15.220
But you make your way up and there's a trap door in the bottom of the platform that's

33:15.220 --> 33:16.220
up there.

33:16.220 --> 33:19.860
But, I mean, if you try it, it's not locked, you can just push it open.

33:19.860 --> 33:22.580
Okay, I do that, I pop my head up.

33:22.580 --> 33:28.980
And inside, it's dark, but you can see what looks like maybe electrical equipment and

33:28.980 --> 33:34.220
some maybe work benches or consoles or something like that, a lot of wiring.

33:34.220 --> 33:40.700
But up above, on a separate platform above you, you can just make out the outline of,

33:40.700 --> 33:45.460
yeah, maybe you've seen something like this before, it looks pretty incongruous, but it

33:45.460 --> 33:52.180
looks like the kind of huge light or bulb or whatever that you'd see in a lighthouse.

33:52.180 --> 33:53.260
Oh, wow.

33:53.260 --> 33:58.300
Why just spill your beans?

33:58.300 --> 34:01.740
I kind of report down to the Lafayette, are you staying at the ground or were you coming

34:01.740 --> 34:02.740
up the ladder behind me?

34:03.260 --> 34:08.300
I mean, he's 100 feet down below in high winds, you're not going to be able to shout down

34:08.300 --> 34:09.300
to him.

34:09.300 --> 34:14.180
So he's peering up and as soon as he sees Harvey peek his head up and get in there and

34:14.180 --> 34:19.540
not be immediately eviscerated or thrown back down, he starts climbing up after him.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.020
You make your way up.

34:21.020 --> 34:26.820
It is a bit of a tricky climb at times, again, because of the high winds and the icy rungs,

34:26.820 --> 34:29.420
but you make it up there.

34:29.420 --> 34:37.020
And sure enough, you are inside this cabin atop the tower that's got glass windows that

34:37.020 --> 34:39.900
are rattling a bit in the high winds.

34:39.900 --> 34:46.780
You can see outside in the darkness the shape of a variety of aerials poking out.

34:46.780 --> 34:54.140
There seems to be a lot of wiring inside and yeah, this light up above you.

34:54.140 --> 34:59.300
You know how that one aerial outside on the house was pointed up at this tower?

34:59.300 --> 35:00.300
What?

35:00.300 --> 35:02.980
I'm sorry, Zach?

35:02.980 --> 35:04.980
He said aerials poking out?

35:04.980 --> 35:11.420
Yeah, he said aerials poking out and Zach looked at me and started playing with his

35:11.420 --> 35:18.300
nips and was like, uh, uh, uh, and then you said aerials again and it just really sounds

35:18.300 --> 35:23.060
like aerial is, so yeah.

35:23.060 --> 35:28.020
Did the nipples that we saw earlier, are they, uh, is there any more of them from our vantage

35:28.020 --> 35:29.020
point now?

35:29.020 --> 35:30.580
Are there any more on the house or anything?

35:30.580 --> 35:37.940
Give me a spot hidden, Raul, because you are looking through heavy snow in the dark.

35:37.940 --> 35:40.260
I pass a 21 on a 70.

35:40.260 --> 35:43.580
Oh, so that's a good, that's a good situation.

35:43.580 --> 35:50.060
So looking around, as you scan around the main house and the outbuildings, no, the only

35:50.060 --> 35:55.980
aerial you can see is the one that is directly above the ballroom, but you do see something

35:55.980 --> 35:56.980
else.

35:56.980 --> 36:04.540
And just for a moment in the darkness, you think you see something moving in the snow,

36:04.540 --> 36:11.280
a large shape is impossibly as up in the air, almost as high up as you are, just moving

36:11.280 --> 36:14.580
fast through the air, a dark shape.

36:14.580 --> 36:15.580
And then it disappears.

36:15.580 --> 36:17.460
Is it going in a certain direction?

36:17.500 --> 36:20.540
It seems to be heading towards the house.

36:20.540 --> 36:21.540
Good question.

36:21.540 --> 36:22.860
But I've lost sight of it at this point.

36:22.860 --> 36:25.700
Yeah, because there isn't any light up here.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.020
It's dark and it's snowy.

36:27.020 --> 36:31.780
Harvey is just pointing to where he last saw it and trying to get Luffit's attention.

36:31.780 --> 36:36.280
Uh, boss, there was a thing and, uh, use your words, man.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.280
What did you see?

36:37.280 --> 36:39.260
I saw a big thing up in the sky over there.

36:39.260 --> 36:42.900
It was, uh, it was, it was moving, it was moving fast, but I did, I lost sight of it.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.100
It was heading for the house.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.480
A big thing moving towards the house.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.480
How big?

36:47.480 --> 36:52.760
It's really difficult to say because there wasn't really anything to give you a sense

36:52.760 --> 36:54.760
of scale as it moved past.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.640
You think it might've been human size, but you're not sure.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.600
We didn't, we didn't pass anyone, Harvey.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.040
What did, what do you think you saw?

37:03.040 --> 37:05.600
It had to have been a, you know, a boy, a boy.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.600
It was a boy.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.600
Nevermind.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.600
It was just a boy.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.640
A boy was, it was in the air.

37:10.640 --> 37:11.960
It was, it was big though.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.520
It was bigger, bigger than I picture most boys, but it had to have been a boy.

37:16.040 --> 37:20.200
What else would it be up at the same level as us at this point?

37:20.200 --> 37:30.480
Lafayette is, um, is thinking hard and tapping his suitcase, but he doesn't open it yet.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.600
So is Lafayette taking a look around at the equipment here?

37:33.600 --> 37:38.600
Yeah, he's going to start investigating what Mordant was up to in here, what he can deduce

37:38.600 --> 37:39.720
that this place is for.

37:39.720 --> 37:40.720
Okay.

37:40.720 --> 37:47.280
Have you a choice here as to whether you use engineering or electrical repair to try to

37:47.280 --> 37:49.000
work all this out?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.840
Those are dead even scores for me.

37:50.840 --> 37:51.840
Okay.

37:51.840 --> 37:56.760
I think for flavor's sake, he's, he's looking at the electronics around here and following

37:56.760 --> 38:01.440
wires and trying to see what is connected, you know, to what device and what it might

38:01.440 --> 38:02.440
be for.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.040
He's probably using both skills to be honest, but he's, you know.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.800
But if you get an ordinary success, you'll be able to work out most of it.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.400
If you get a hard success, I'll give you something extra.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.200
I got a 54 on a 90.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.200
Oh, close.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.200
You could spend nine.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.880
You could spend nine points of luck.

38:17.880 --> 38:18.880
You'll learn a bit more.

38:18.880 --> 38:19.880
Do it.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.880
I will do it.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.880
Nice.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
Good.

38:22.880 --> 38:29.120
I'm, I'm all about whittling down that luck, preferably to get you below 30.

38:29.120 --> 38:32.080
Oh shit.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.480
I forgot.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.720
Can you explain why?

38:34.720 --> 38:35.720
Okay.

38:35.720 --> 38:42.760
In pulp Cthulhu, you can survive certain death, so you could have, yeah, you could be on top

38:42.760 --> 38:43.760
of this tower.

38:43.760 --> 38:49.280
It catches fire and the, the falling structure collapses down into the forest below.

38:49.280 --> 38:54.040
Yeah, almost certainly killing anyone, but as long as you have 30 points of luck or more,

38:54.040 --> 38:58.600
you can spend all your luck in one go and survive that certain death and just narrate

38:58.600 --> 39:00.800
how you managed to get out of the situation.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.800
Okay.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.840
As soon as you have less than 30 points of luck, however, you're dead.

39:04.840 --> 39:09.640
Well, okay, so yeah, I do.

39:09.640 --> 39:16.960
He spends the luck and he, are you sure you want to, yeah, I'm, I'm above 30.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.520
I'm doing all right.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.600
He spends that luck.

39:19.600 --> 39:25.200
He puts it all together and, and has an epiphany moment and, and what does he discover?

39:25.200 --> 39:29.200
One thing I'll ask before you do this, do you have any points of Cthulhu Mythos?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.800
I have 10%.

39:30.880 --> 39:34.240
We'll see what that applies in a moment.

39:35.360 --> 39:41.760
The first thing that you work out is that this does tie in with your working theory as

39:41.760 --> 39:46.880
to what that other antenna was, that electrical wiring and the antenna around here do

39:46.880 --> 39:55.840
seem to be receiving equipment for whatever is going to get transmitted from the house.

39:56.240 --> 40:02.800
And you reckon that when the power turns up, that it is going to light up that huge light

40:02.800 --> 40:03.360
up above.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.040
Sorry, what light is that?

40:05.680 --> 40:08.880
The huge lighthouse type bulb that is above your head.

40:09.920 --> 40:18.000
What makes less sense to you is some of the other antennae that are around here, because

40:18.000 --> 40:23.680
looking at the design and looking at the way everything is connected, there are a few

40:23.680 --> 40:28.960
smaller antennae that point out in other directions that you're fairly certain are

40:28.960 --> 40:34.400
designed to transmit, but they don't look like they're designed to transmit power.

40:35.280 --> 40:40.400
They look like maybe radio antennae, but you're not really sure.

40:40.400 --> 40:45.680
There's something about the design that looks weird even to you.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.880
And this is where you could give me a Cthulhu Mythos roll if you want.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.120
Are there penalties for fumbling?

40:51.760 --> 40:55.360
Um, well, penalties, no.

40:57.680 --> 40:58.960
Maybe a lot of fun to be had.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.760
Are there ways to make the story cooler?

41:02.480 --> 41:08.480
Right now, he just has that weird tingle at the back of his mind again, and he knows something's

41:08.480 --> 41:08.980
not right.

41:10.320 --> 41:14.560
But I can guarantee if he fumbles, something fun will happen.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.280
You should do it.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.120
Yeah, you should definitely do it.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.560
It'd be weird if you didn't.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.600
No, I'm not going to do it.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.200
We should have told Thomas not to do it.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.160
Hey, Thomas, don't do it.

41:30.160 --> 41:30.960
I'm not...

41:30.960 --> 41:32.080
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

41:35.840 --> 41:42.320
Okay, so yeah, I mean, there's something weird about the design of these, but you can't quite

41:42.320 --> 41:43.680
work out what it is.

41:43.680 --> 41:47.280
You know, Harvey, there's something quite weird about all this, but I can't work out

41:47.280 --> 41:47.920
what it is.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.880
What do you mean by weird?

41:48.880 --> 41:52.080
I mean, it's a lot of that same kind of equipment you got in your place.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.680
Nothing's weird here.

41:53.680 --> 41:59.040
Again, Harvey, I know the distinction may be subtle to one such as you, but I'm a man

41:59.040 --> 42:01.520
of science, and this is weird science.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.960
Do you need a twine on anything?

42:05.520 --> 42:06.560
Maybe take some readings?

42:07.200 --> 42:08.400
He's a little depressed.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.840
This is more advanced than he thought Mordant was capable of.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.520
He doesn't know exactly what it is.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.200
He knows it might be cool.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.240
It's at least big.

42:18.480 --> 42:24.560
And he's like, oh, Harvey, this evening isn't going anything like I imagined.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.560
I haven't even seen Cicero or his wife.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.920
He dejectedly flips a couple switches on and off, and he's like, but what's the point?

42:31.920 --> 42:34.480
Does anything happen with those switch flips?

42:34.480 --> 42:36.320
No, because there's no power at the moment.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.280
Yeah, the power looks like it's running from the house to here.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.200
There are no power sources here.

42:43.200 --> 42:50.640
Yeah, it looks like if you're right, and that antenna on the main building transmits

42:50.640 --> 42:56.000
electrical energy, it looks like that powers everything that's up here on the tower.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.560
You could probably roll Cthulhu Mythos to figure out more.

42:59.200 --> 42:59.920
Probably could, yeah.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.520
Might fumble, though.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.360
It'd be cool if he did.

43:03.360 --> 43:04.640
But what if he passed?

43:06.080 --> 43:07.600
It's a one-shot.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.160
You shouldn't...

43:08.160 --> 43:08.660
Yeah.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.720
Listen, I'm not familiar with Pulp Cthulhu.

43:14.720 --> 43:18.560
I just know that when you mess up Mythos shit and the other versions of shit...

43:19.120 --> 43:20.400
It makes it cooler?

43:20.400 --> 43:22.880
No, things go very, very bad.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.040
It makes everything cooler.

43:25.040 --> 43:28.960
We're Pulp Cthulhu heroes this time, so even when shit goes bad,

43:28.960 --> 43:30.560
we're still going to be able to pull it out.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.320
He can mind attack people.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.440
Yeah, I fucking mind it.

43:33.440 --> 43:36.640
I just feel like he's fooled everyone else in this room here.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.160
He was like, no, just do it.

43:40.160 --> 43:40.960
It'll be fun.

43:40.960 --> 43:45.920
Scott has built an awesome roller coaster, and I just want to strap in and ride it.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.640
Then you take a Mythos roll, bitch.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.720
One thing I'll point out, though, is that in Pulp Cthulhu,

43:52.720 --> 43:54.880
you can spend luck to mitigate fumbles.

43:54.880 --> 43:55.440
That's true.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.920
The fumble is only if it's a 96 or higher, right?

43:57.920 --> 43:58.400
Yes.

43:58.400 --> 43:59.680
Oh, that's fucking nothing.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.560
Yeah, just roll it.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.060
All right.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.280
24.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.440
God damn it, that would have been so funny.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.400
24, yeah.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.840
You could spend 14 luck.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.040
No, no, I'm good on that.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.840
Oh, Cthulhu Mythos?

44:11.840 --> 44:12.640
I'm okay on that.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.400
Okay, then...

44:16.400 --> 44:18.000
Oh, well, hmm.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.440
Cthulhu Mythos?

44:19.440 --> 44:20.560
You think it's that important?

44:20.560 --> 44:21.840
It's pretty cool, yeah.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.160
No one ever passes these.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.200
No, dude, I cannot spend that much luck.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.880
I can't spend that much luck right now.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.560
I'm sorry, dude.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.120
God damn it, I've never been more disappointed.

44:34.640 --> 44:35.920
Can I spend my luck?

44:36.320 --> 44:40.320
I'll spend 14 of my luck to make this a success.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.800
Next episode, if you guys want to trudge out here

44:43.680 --> 44:46.160
and spend your luck, do your Mythos rolls.

44:46.160 --> 44:46.560
I will.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.080
I'll spend 14 of my luck.

44:48.080 --> 44:50.320
And we'll talk to the movie stars and the senators.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.480
You know, I am willing to accept that.

44:52.480 --> 44:52.960
Fuck yeah.

44:52.960 --> 44:53.840
The movie stars is.

44:54.640 --> 44:57.520
You're willing to sacrifice 14 of your luck?

44:58.320 --> 44:59.440
Hell yeah.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.040
It's that psychic link you guys have.

45:01.360 --> 45:12.000
Then what you pick up from this is there is something about the design of these other

45:12.000 --> 45:18.640
aerials that is, for a start, very different from any of the other technology that you

45:18.640 --> 45:20.080
can see around here.

45:20.080 --> 45:25.600
But there is something that, as bizarre as it might sound to your obviously rational

45:25.600 --> 45:29.200
mad scientist mind, is that it seems...

45:30.000 --> 45:31.040
Sorry, we're losing you.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.440
And it made a really funny sound as we lost you.

45:33.440 --> 45:34.160
Yeah, it did.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.000
You're like, as bizarre as it might sound...

45:41.840 --> 45:43.120
Am I practicing with you?

45:44.400 --> 45:44.720
Yes.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.480
Yeah, you seem good now, yeah.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.840
Okay, I'll try that again.

45:48.880 --> 45:55.440
As bizarre as it might sound to your otherwise rational mad scientist mind, there is something

45:55.440 --> 46:01.280
about the design of these other aerials and the circuitry leading to them that looks,

46:02.000 --> 46:03.360
well, alien.

46:04.320 --> 46:08.960
You're fairly certain that the technology here, even though you may never have encountered

46:08.960 --> 46:17.920
anything like it before, is not of this Earth, and that it is designed to broadcast some

46:17.920 --> 46:22.560
kind of signal using means you can't quite identify.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.520
You think that the signal that it's sending out may even be a psychic one?

46:30.160 --> 46:31.200
Sanity check.

46:32.640 --> 46:32.880
Yeah.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.960
Do I need to take a sand check for that?

46:36.960 --> 46:38.320
I don't think so, no.

46:39.600 --> 46:44.480
You are a mad scientist, you've got weird science, so I think this is in your wheelhouse.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.360
Awesome.

46:45.360 --> 46:49.760
Okay, so grasping what is going on and being an intensely jealous man...

46:50.640 --> 46:55.600
Um, Harvey, would you lend me a hand in destroying all of this?

46:59.040 --> 47:02.800
And he wants to just smash up everything, and it's like a fit of...

47:02.800 --> 47:04.800
It's like professional rage.

47:05.360 --> 47:09.120
He can't believe Mordant has built a tower.

47:09.120 --> 47:16.880
A, he has a bad feeling about what the purposes of that broadcast are, but B, he is just enraged

47:16.880 --> 47:23.600
that Cicero Mordant has built this kick-ass alien radio tower, and he is going to smash

47:23.600 --> 47:24.400
it like a child.

47:25.040 --> 47:26.640
Harvey cracks his knuckles.

47:26.640 --> 47:27.680
Say no more, boss!

47:27.680 --> 47:30.160
And comes down with a Hulk smash on the nearest console.

47:32.560 --> 47:37.280
Lafayette unscrews a knob from like a lever and chucks it at the big light bulb.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.240
Oh, yes!

47:39.760 --> 47:44.800
In which case, let's cut away from you two as you have your protracted temper tantrum,

47:44.800 --> 47:47.600
and go back to the others in the ballroom.

47:48.400 --> 47:54.080
Mr. Ring was going to have his second pass at trying to meet the senator, and this time

47:54.080 --> 47:56.480
he is accompanied by his boss.

47:57.760 --> 48:03.200
Can you give me listen rolls each, just to see whether you can pick up snatches of conversation

48:04.160 --> 48:05.360
as you're passing through?

48:05.360 --> 48:06.480
I got an aught too.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.120
Oh, I also pass 35 on a 50.

48:09.120 --> 48:09.760
Then...

48:09.760 --> 48:11.920
I don't super pass, like, uh...

48:11.920 --> 48:18.240
Yeah, well, I think what Mr. Ring picks up is just a couple of snatches of conversation

48:19.440 --> 48:26.080
where you do hear that phrase being repeated that you heard a few months ago.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.520
It's going to change the world, you know.

48:28.160 --> 48:35.840
But what Cheggers picks up on a 0-2 is one of the groups you move past.

48:35.840 --> 48:40.640
There are three people standing together, all talking to each other enthusiastically,

48:41.440 --> 48:45.360
and they're all just looking at each other over and over again, saying,

48:45.360 --> 48:46.880
it's going to change the world, you know.

48:46.880 --> 48:48.160
It's going to change the world, you know.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.520
It's going to change the world, you know.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.880
It's going to change the world, you know.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.800
It's going to change the world, you know.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.480
That's so good.

48:54.480 --> 48:56.080
That's so fucking cool.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.240
Can you give me a sand roll?

48:59.280 --> 49:02.000
I love this game so much.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.840
Is my sanity equal to my power?

49:03.840 --> 49:04.320
Is that right?

49:04.320 --> 49:05.120
Yeah.

49:05.120 --> 49:05.840
Initially, yes.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.680
I pass then, 75 on a 90.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.720
So yeah, you don't lose any sand for that, but it may still send a shiver up your spine.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.480
Yeah, it creeps me out for sure.

49:14.480 --> 49:20.560
And then I make a mental note of like, maybe Elden can get into their heads later.

49:20.560 --> 49:23.040
Like, they seem pretty easy.

49:23.040 --> 49:23.680
Pretty easy.

49:24.480 --> 49:26.320
Because that's worked out so well for himself.

49:26.320 --> 49:26.820
Yeah.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.040
Sweat drops down from his forehead.

49:31.040 --> 49:36.640
But honestly, the invention is pretty low on my concern level.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.140
Same.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.800
Senator is top priority for me.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.040
So we're continuing on to Billings.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.640
Senator is a way bigger deal than actor.

49:46.640 --> 49:50.000
So we're going to really give our go here.

49:50.000 --> 49:57.840
OK, so yeah, you walk over and the senator is talking to a younger woman, maybe in her

49:57.840 --> 49:58.560
30s.

49:59.600 --> 50:03.200
She's very expensively dressed, wearing a nice diamond necklace.

50:03.920 --> 50:09.360
She's perhaps not the most attractive woman you've ever met.

50:13.520 --> 50:20.560
She's got one eye that seems to swivel around a bit and a nose that's a bit too large for

50:20.560 --> 50:20.960
her face.

50:20.960 --> 50:23.680
But she's got an absolutely radiant smile.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.600
Just roasting this poor woman.

50:25.600 --> 50:28.080
Yeah, you were really rude until the last thing.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.360
He based it on your mom.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.600
That's why it takes so much offense.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.360
You could give me education rolls, the two of you, just to see whether you recognize

50:41.360 --> 50:41.600
her.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.960
I think I do recognize her.

50:42.960 --> 50:43.360
I do, too.

50:43.360 --> 50:44.800
With the 24, 54.

50:44.800 --> 50:48.080
OK, yeah, again, you've seen her in the society pages.

50:48.080 --> 50:52.160
This is Margaret Payne, who's the heiress of the Payne fortune.

50:52.160 --> 51:01.200
She is primarily a philanthropist that she's involved in a lot of humanitarian and art

51:01.200 --> 51:01.840
charities.

51:02.800 --> 51:07.840
And she and Senator Billings seem to be talking quite animatedly as you come over.

51:07.840 --> 51:12.000
So, yeah, as we approach them, Eldon, you take the senator.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.200
Yeah, of course, Checkers.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.200
Yeah, definitely.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.400
What was her name again?

51:16.400 --> 51:17.120
Margaret Payne.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.560
He whispers.

51:18.560 --> 51:22.720
He's like the bag man for Checkers.

51:22.720 --> 51:28.720
He's like, it's Margaret Payne is the philanthropist and Charlton Billings is the senator from

51:28.720 --> 51:29.280
Vermont.

51:29.280 --> 51:29.780
Thank you.

51:30.580 --> 51:33.620
Miss, Miss Payne.

51:33.620 --> 51:38.260
And she looks around and says, oh, do we know each other?

51:38.260 --> 51:39.380
We're about to.

51:39.380 --> 51:41.540
And I turn the charm on.

51:45.540 --> 51:47.380
I should give you a penalty on the charm.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.580
Well, I roll an ought to again.

51:50.580 --> 51:55.380
Oh, my God.

51:55.380 --> 52:03.060
Then somehow, despite that opening, she seems to warm to you and say, oh, did we meet at

52:03.620 --> 52:05.940
that party in the Hamptons last summer?

52:05.940 --> 52:07.300
You do look very familiar.

52:07.300 --> 52:12.100
I don't believe we've met in real life, but you have seen me in your dreams.

52:15.300 --> 52:20.500
And she tilts her head back and laughs quite musically and says, oh, you are funny.

52:21.460 --> 52:22.260
Yes, funny.

52:25.300 --> 52:29.460
I actually have a charity that you might be interested in.

52:29.460 --> 52:32.420
I know that you're a big, big into philanthropy.

52:32.420 --> 52:34.980
And yeah, the last branch.

52:34.980 --> 52:37.140
Have you ever heard of us?

52:37.140 --> 52:42.100
The last branch, I'll tell you what, give me a LUCK roll.

52:44.420 --> 52:45.860
24 on a 32.

52:45.860 --> 52:51.540
Yes, I'm trying to work out whether it would be luckier or unluckier.

52:53.060 --> 52:56.180
I think it's probably I think it's probably better for you if she hasn't heard of you.

52:56.180 --> 52:56.660
Right.

52:56.660 --> 52:57.380
Yep.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.580
And she says, no, but you must tell me more.

53:00.580 --> 53:04.100
Oh, well, we've got, you know, Miss Jermaine?

53:04.100 --> 53:08.180
Oh, the actress, I saw her earlier.

53:08.180 --> 53:09.300
Yeah, she's a big...

53:09.300 --> 53:11.620
Between you and me, I'm a little bit worried about her.

53:11.620 --> 53:15.860
I saw her come back from the lavatory earlier and there was white powder on her nose.

53:15.860 --> 53:16.260
Oh, yeah.

53:16.260 --> 53:17.780
Ask this lady if she has any cocaine.

53:19.220 --> 53:22.180
The one who's worried about them then doesn't know what to wipe out.

53:22.180 --> 53:22.500
Yeah.

53:22.500 --> 53:22.740
Yeah.

53:22.740 --> 53:29.220
Well, I actually spoke to her when we arrived at the party and I got rid of that for her.

53:29.220 --> 53:30.260
I was worried as well.

53:35.220 --> 53:38.580
Oh, you must be such a good friend to her.

53:38.580 --> 53:42.100
She is a very important part of our organization.

53:42.100 --> 53:46.420
The mind is the most important part of the human soul body space.

53:46.420 --> 53:46.660
Yeah.

53:46.660 --> 53:52.500
So our organization serves to help free people's minds in a sense.

53:52.500 --> 53:56.580
Oh, do you find a lot of people whose minds are enchained?

53:56.580 --> 53:57.540
Everybody's is.

53:58.260 --> 53:59.620
Yours included.

53:59.620 --> 54:00.500
Really?

54:00.500 --> 54:00.900
Really?

54:01.940 --> 54:02.260
Yes.

54:02.260 --> 54:02.500
Yes.

54:02.500 --> 54:03.620
You must tell me more about this.

54:04.180 --> 54:08.980
Before we get into all that, have you seen our host anywhere?

54:08.980 --> 54:10.900
I'm a little bit worried about him.

54:10.900 --> 54:11.780
I have not.

54:11.780 --> 54:13.300
Have you seen him this evening?

54:13.300 --> 54:14.020
Not at all.

54:14.020 --> 54:15.220
And I'm a bit worried.

54:15.220 --> 54:16.740
Cicero and I go way back.

54:18.100 --> 54:20.180
We were engaged, we married once.

54:20.180 --> 54:24.900
But tell us more about the heartbreak that must have come from that.

54:27.220 --> 54:30.580
Well, relationships fail for a variety of different reasons.

54:30.580 --> 54:35.620
But I'm more concerned about how he's been in recent months.

54:35.620 --> 54:39.540
I mean, have you seen him at all over the last year?

54:40.580 --> 54:42.580
He's a changed man, isn't he?

54:42.580 --> 54:44.260
I'm really quite worried about him.

54:44.260 --> 54:52.180
I mean, we were talking about your young lady friend a little while back and perhaps indulgences.

54:52.180 --> 54:53.860
But I'm...

54:54.740 --> 54:56.900
Do you think he's indulging?

54:56.900 --> 55:00.420
Is she paying to get her sins removed so that she may go to heaven?

55:00.580 --> 55:04.340
Eldon, quiet for a second.

55:07.060 --> 55:10.420
Nobody had Luke tell Zach to calm down Bingo.

55:18.260 --> 55:22.500
She looks at Mr. Ring quizzically for a moment and then continues,

55:23.460 --> 55:25.860
Well, I'm just a bit concerned, yes, that...

55:27.300 --> 55:33.300
I don't know, maybe it's nothing but some of the changes I've seen in his personality

55:33.300 --> 55:38.180
and the changes in his health, I'm a little bit worried about him.

55:38.180 --> 55:42.180
Particularly the fact that he hasn't made an entrance when this is his big night.

55:42.180 --> 55:44.980
And you know Cicero, don't you?

55:44.980 --> 55:51.540
I mean, you know how much he loves working a crowd and making new friends.

55:52.180 --> 55:57.060
Quick question, when you think about his new invention, what comes to mind?

55:58.020 --> 55:59.140
It's going to change the world.

56:03.140 --> 56:05.860
I look at Eldon and I'm like, do the thing.

56:05.860 --> 56:10.340
He looks back and he looks scared and he like shakes his head no

56:10.340 --> 56:16.340
and like kind of like moves back away from you like a dog that did something wrong.

56:16.340 --> 56:19.860
I pull the smelling salt vial thing out of my pocket, I'm like,

56:20.500 --> 56:21.000
it's okay.

56:22.660 --> 56:29.060
The pained look on Eldon Ring's face as he tries to decide whether or not he can...

56:29.060 --> 56:30.260
Margaret Payne look.

56:31.860 --> 56:36.340
As he's trying to decide, you know, whether or not he needs to follow his master's...

56:36.340 --> 56:41.620
Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!

56:41.620 --> 56:43.300
Okay, well give me that roll.

56:44.420 --> 56:48.420
I legitimately feel like stunned and psychic attacked every time you do that.

56:48.500 --> 56:51.220
I got really excited because I rolled a 44.

56:51.220 --> 56:52.740
That is a hard success though.

56:52.740 --> 56:53.140
Nice.

56:53.140 --> 56:54.340
I thought it was a crit.

56:54.340 --> 56:56.100
Oh, but we're not playing.

56:56.100 --> 56:59.940
I am going to roll against you from your psychic opponent.

56:59.940 --> 57:00.440
Of course.

57:01.780 --> 57:02.660
Hard felt good.

57:03.540 --> 57:04.420
Hard felt good.

57:04.420 --> 57:05.060
That's what she said.

57:06.260 --> 57:06.820
Wow.

57:06.820 --> 57:09.220
Yeah, that's an extreme.

57:09.220 --> 57:10.420
Oh, fucking shit!

57:13.780 --> 57:18.020
This time the darkness closes around your mind once more.

57:18.980 --> 57:22.820
And you hear this, this voice again in the darkness.

57:23.940 --> 57:27.540
Oh, you are a tenacious little thing, aren't you?

57:28.580 --> 57:32.020
I think, I think we should play together.

57:33.300 --> 57:34.420
Would you enjoy that?

57:35.460 --> 57:35.940
Yes, sir.

57:36.580 --> 57:38.340
Good, good.

57:39.060 --> 57:43.700
I think while you're here, why don't you help me?

57:44.260 --> 57:44.760
Okay.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.920
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

57:46.920 --> 57:48.520
You'd like to help me.

57:49.560 --> 57:52.360
Yeah, everybody likes to be useful.

57:52.360 --> 57:54.040
Yes, I thought you would.

57:55.720 --> 58:02.840
Well, it is very, very important that everything goes well as possible tonight.

58:02.840 --> 58:06.040
There's no interference, no silly games.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.120
I think it's important there's no silly games.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.440
And more importantly, that everyone is impressed

58:11.080 --> 58:17.000
by Cicero's invention because it's going to change the world, you know.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.760
It's going to change the world, you know.

58:18.760 --> 58:23.240
And you do understand how important it is to get that message out there.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.960
I can feel your little gifts there.

58:28.920 --> 58:34.120
Why don't you use them in service of me and of Cicero

58:34.120 --> 58:38.440
and of the glory that his invention will bring to the world?

58:38.440 --> 58:39.480
What's your name, sir?

58:39.480 --> 58:41.240
I have many names.

58:42.120 --> 58:44.840
I have so many names.

58:46.040 --> 58:46.600
That's cool.

58:46.600 --> 58:47.720
I gave myself mine.

58:49.240 --> 58:50.600
Well, isn't that special?

58:57.240 --> 59:02.040
The evil voice in your head really condescended to you there.

59:02.680 --> 59:03.240
No, no, no.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.680
I felt no condescension.

59:04.680 --> 59:07.160
Elden Ring is like, oh, yes, to be held.

59:07.160 --> 59:12.120
Checkers is standing there looking at you with your eyes rolled back in your head.

59:12.120 --> 59:14.120
And he's like, he's nailing it.

59:18.120 --> 59:20.280
That's my boy in psychic warfare.

59:20.840 --> 59:25.240
Well, if I can count on you to help me with this small matter,

59:25.240 --> 59:28.440
then I'm sure we'll be great friends.

59:28.440 --> 59:32.280
Otherwise, I may have to punish you.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.600
You do understand, don't you?

59:34.600 --> 59:36.360
Yeah, I sure wouldn't like that.

59:36.440 --> 59:37.560
Good, good, good.

59:37.560 --> 59:38.680
I'm so happy.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.520
And if you're happy with me framing it this way,

59:43.400 --> 59:50.360
perhaps then Mr. Ring wakes up once again there on the ground with checkers.

59:50.360 --> 59:52.440
You're doing the spending salt trick again

59:52.440 --> 59:57.160
and Miss Payne and the senators standing there looking worried.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.000
And standing in between them is the Reverend Nye,

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.840
and he just smiles down at you and winks

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.320
and just for a moment as he winks,

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.320
you can see that his eyes are completely black.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.320
Fuck yeah!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.640
Oh, hell yes.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.600
Yes, yes, yes.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.920
I didn't know that the wind could sew

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.920
through tissue and faggot bone.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.920
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:59.400
Hollow when you said

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:07.560
I thought you might be starving

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:17.560
so I gave you everything.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:23.720
Thorns and rocks and devils' clothes

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.360
and briars and private clay

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.640
and crocus blossoms in February

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:37.640
and I live in May.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.400
Time between a mother's fingers

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.520
and spit off of a bridge.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:56.520
Restless legs at 3pm while waiting for a fix.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:43.320
So come back here and see what's left of me.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:53.480
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

01:02:53.480 --> 01:03:05.000
My voice is nothing now but the howl of the wind.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.520
Come closer dear, in my teeth,

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.000
thread her in my jaw.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.720
Come closer dear, in my teeth.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.800
Thread her in my jaw.
