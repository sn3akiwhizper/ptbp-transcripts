663.34 716.46 speaker1  his sex icon status i think is really powering to stand up because you can't be sexy while you're bleeding on the ground i thought you're gonna say sitting down or sitting down

1127.74 1203.10 speaker1  get to do mm-hmm zach never gives me alone times anymore you just have to make bold bold character secret kiss secret kiss
1194.22 1325.98 speaker2  is horrifyingly staring at the head of pastor sheriff preacher doctor pastored preacher doctor pastored preacher sheriff doctor bobby custard which is on the ground about 10 feet away from him judge ephran courtland as you walk out you see that head just sitting on the ground and you do not see the body blood is everywhere and the three of these men are the only ones out here you no longer find the wild crazed teenager
1321.18 1347.34 speaker1  predict it i've been in plenty of bar fights where i accidentally punched some fellers i didn't mean to and when you throw guns in the mix you just know you're asking for trouble it ain't your fault so just to if you could if you could put the head down and and we might need you in
1343.26 1372.06 speaker0  needed inside and he takes he doesn't put the head down he carries it with him

1389.98 1778.94 speaker2  with you into the home with two hands or by the hair with one hand or you buy the hair with one you're you're interrupting a good character moment is the first thing you notice as you pass through the swinging open front door of the whole abode at first you think the stench could be from the unattended dishes strewn throughout this living room the remnants of several meals now covered in a few buzzing flies but that static hum of flies it's so loud in your ears and looking over you see that that is due to the large swarm hovering about the body of miss kitty which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs lifeless to be sure because this body the skin is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off or completely missing and the dripping dark red blood pooling below on the floor but especially lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled her back held directly in the middle by one of the armrests there's an unnatural angle there as the top half of her torso dangles straight down none of you lose any sanity and you're all able to make a listen check from the next room deeper into this house
1772.46 1963.66 speaker1  blood there i don't horse if you could put a napkin under bobby that would be he's dripping his house last night and that's he must have caught her that's that's got to be what happened
1958.70 2324.54 speaker0  i don't rightly know and i head towards the first door and just kind of i can't prance around like i used to horse green isn't going down the hallway towards the door because he and the skull gently grab a horse by the sleeve and like pull him like guide him into the room
2317.74 2541.26 speaker2  into this room right as you are at the threshold of this door looking down you see hey if uh ever at pace and jack pearlman justin joe if you could take off your headphones real quick as well as luke that would be phenomenal detached head bobby custard you notice out of the corner of your peripheral a disturbingly magnificent technicolor swirl of light covering the part of the floor in this room that's immediately in front of you it's likely the most beautiful thing you have ever seen and yet there is an endlessness about it that inspires both awe and dread i need you to roll sanity into the room however you are at a current angle where you are right now walking towards this door to where you can't quite see where he went once he got into the room and you can't really see
2536.30 2593.74 speaker1  chanting and stops and listens for a second and kind of looks back at judge and pearlman
2586.14 2639.02 speaker2  of the floor right is you where you're about to walk in on i need you to roll a sanity check as all of these rainbow colors just wash back and forth in a circle around where your next step
2635.02 2652.70 speaker1  not too worried about it he just thinks that a pretty light show going on in here somehow
2644.86 2716.62 speaker2  feel your foot continue to move through the floor as ever it pays trips and falls face first into
2713.02 2741.10 speaker1  happened you think we we must have stepped in a bear trap got us got us through an artery or
2733.10 2796.54 speaker0  normally i'm a man of of reason and science but uh well science never made me feel like this
2787.26 2951.50 speaker2  and evert pace have walked through you see on the floor an incredible swirl of technicolor vibrancy just washing about in circles around and around the floor and i need you to roll sanity for you're going to be at a negative depending on what you want to do here okay but looking into this room uh you just see the majority of this floor about half the room is covered in this a bed that is flipped over and from behind it you hear a dexterity at a negative 20 to keep your footing as you enter into this room negative 20 because as your foot steps into this room without being able to make the jump over it or stop yourself from stepping onto it your foot moves through the floor and you begin falling through this technicolor swirl of a portal and you begin falling upward exact same time every color you've ever seen swirling around you and above you there's nothing but the absence of light and the bodies of ever at pace and professor horse green who are having
2947.18 3054.46 speaker0  too into it because we're probably gonna have to do this again with the judge really quickly here face you're asking a lot of questions for a content person you're kind of ruining the vibe
3047.50 3068.46 speaker2  sitting on the ground above you is pure darkness the same darkness that you've seen above you this
3067.02 3102.46 speaker0  holy fuck sack
3096.30 3240.78 speaker2  of preacher sheriff dr bobby custard as he's jeff dunham's jesus traveling through this technicolor cylinder and on the other side goes up into the bedroom of silas and mary cole moves directly up to the face of judge ephraim and silas pushes the bed back over into its horizontal position and he rushes to judge ephraim courtland and throws his arms around the back of his neck
3238.14 3289.50 speaker0  like in a zack game
3278.62 3336.70 speaker3  my poor little darling so and you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little
3329.66 3409.82 speaker2  playing it a few programming notes since i can't exactly ask wolf to apologize on my behalf this episode took quite a bit longer than usual to publish that's my bad i'm still getting used to working full time on another continent i just couldn't get it all done last week i have i have so much love for this project and i end up pouring more time into it than i have to make this thing i'm absurdly proud of uh so the next episode episode 96 will come out next friday october 2nd uh for those of you blessed generous demented folks in the patreon i am working feverishly to put up the audio for both luke's homebrew delta green one shot as well as our delightfully silly game of roll for shoes set in a very goofy outer space if you've enjoyed this show so far i would really love it if you could take a minute to leave a review on apple podcasts follow us on or something like that i don't know maybe those are just a few nice things that would uh oh boy howdy it would just make me feel real good now from the bottom of my black oozy squamous heart oh
