55080	62420	I took my dog wolf the dog to go find him something to feel his big old belly up with but upon

87280	92200	It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top
92200	99000	I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit

163480	165480	but with a higher pitched voice

244320	246320	humanoid figure
246320	248320	a
248960	251640	Older version of himself just stood
252320	254600	None of that made a lick of sense to me
254600	262040	But that doesn't mean I'm not hungry filling me up as always is kudzu with no
263200	265200	back-bone

302960	304960	Kind of we're pretending to be
307320	313920	76 the good people. Oh, yeah, you guys are the people people like you guys are great people
316160	321440	So I did tell you last time that we played that the next time that we played
322600	324600	You would be back as
324760	331280	Who you are? So I want you to get into the consciousness of your characters. John Lee Pettymore
331960	333960	Clark Bishop Keith Vigna
334800	336120	Remember
336120	338120	What it feels like?
338640	340920	inside the skin of these
341720	344080	Trash people. Oh boy. It's me clock
346200	348800	And it's me oh, I'm I'm back baby
350960	355040	Paul Lee Pettymore if that part makes the podcast I quit
356880	358520	You are now
358520	365600	John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop John John Lee Kevin Moore. Is that what you view yourself as?
365600	369480	I feel like it's the best portmanteau to describe
370560	372560	portmanteau
376120	378120	The best portmanteau
378320	384460	To describe his current situation. Yeah, also since he's made of since he's made of metal and is basically a robo cop
384640	387080	Will you beef up my stats? Can I get cool stats?
387480	389480	Well you cool stats, please
391060	396120	Okay, yeah, that's fine give yourself a plus 10 to strength and
397040	404080	Constitution and a negative 10 to dexterity and Keith Vigna do the same plus 10 to the base, right so that
408760	411560	20 strength 20 Constitution 3 dexterity
412560	414560	Oh
414840	421280	Thomas when you see your character in a dream in the mirror what version is it? What does he look like?
421840	424720	John og the fourth correct
425360	427360	canonically the og yes from
428000	431560	Not like the from the first episode of pretending to be people a new hope
433720	437980	So that is the version that you all see when you see yourselves
438760	440120	existing in
440160	447280	An infinite darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you out of your own bodies
447560	452920	floating in this vast nothingness you see Keith Vigna open a door and
453400	459480	Tildy be Mitchell is there on the other side curled up in the fetal position and her body begins
460440	464340	Deteriorating hastily like she has leprosy but in time-lapse
465000	469320	However, she grows larger and larger with each passing moment
469920	474560	Clark Bishop is seen handing an old piece of parchment to a young boy
475000	480640	with a balloon shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black and
480800	488420	immediately the boys feet catch fire and the fire grows and grows to consume the young black eyed boy and
488720	492080	You hear three voices cry out in pain
493440	495440	John Lee Pettymore
495480	498320	Is crouched down crouched down
498840	504140	He's crouched down staring at a television. That is a blank white screen
504280	507960	He reaches out and touches the screen like Vanna White
507960	515680	But instead of a letter popping up Clark Bishop's parents Eunice and Jerry the size of action figures
516040	520960	Jump out of the television screen and run up John Lee Pettymore the fourth arm
521660	525960	Climbing his shoulder and flinging themselves into John's head
526920	530940	No, the bishops are going to disappear right into petty Moore's brain
531080	537600	But they both get stuck halfway in their legs writhing about and flailing in this never-ending
538480	539560	dreamscape
539560	546040	Oily viscous sludge begins dripping and then spraying out of John Lee Pettymore the force head
546160	549680	Where the bishops have lodged themselves and the ooze begins
549880	557100	Collecting on a ground below now made of light and the ooze drip strips drips and then pours
557480	559400	until a laminar flow
559400	566600	Connects the head of John Lee Pettymore the fourth to a pool of this inky substance that begins shaping itself
566800	572140	Into a large saucer, but as the pool grows the walls begin rising outward
572620	574620	Creating an imposingly colossal
574620	582100	Bowl and our view must back up leagues as this shape continues to form a mirror of what is now below
582340	586640	the minuscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance
587300	590500	continues to fill this thing's final form an
591660	592820	incomprehensibly
592820	599660	massive sphere and it continues to grow and grow and grow and
600660	602660	Then
603100	605100	The three of you wake up
605460	611140	you feel like you're in shock your stomach feels weirdly full and
611900	618900	Your ears are ringing and you feel content, but it's dark and it's cold and it smells smells like
619740	623340	Almost sweet like like there's meat maybe
623340	625340	Your
625420	633180	Eyes begin to adjust and there's a pool of blood on the floor next to it is a coffin on the ground and this
633380	634420	mausoleum
634420	636420	And you look at each other
636540	643180	Blood splatters speckled all over each one of you John Lee Kevin Moore and all black tactical gear
643340	647060	Keith vigna and his brightly colored polo and boat shoes
647540	654660	Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak
655220	656940	and the shock
656940	660660	Begins to wear off and you feel the searing pain you felt before
660980	666340	on your chest on your back on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm and
667180	671860	This time when you guys look around at each other and check each other's
672700	675700	Skin, not only is the word Marvin crossed out
676300	682580	But the word Maggie on each of your left feet is also crossed out. Hello again, boys
684500	691980	Are we is this we're back we're back this is this is where we woke up last time we made it
693420	699780	Again, how many times is this now? This would be the 30s. How many times are we gonna do this?
699780	703160	This is the third time that we've woken up in here
703200	709280	But this is the second time after we've died right where was Maggie written on our bodies our feet
709280	715000	I take my shoe off because my foot is super itchy and I start scratching it and then realize that it's
715320	719520	Exed out the only two names left her Drew and Tilly
719520	724920	What do you guys think we did that made the Maggie get crossed off? I mean the last thing I remember is is
727080	729640	Just piles of cash at the University
729640	731640	What
732640	737960	Does Clark remember of like the feeling that he had before he did what he did like this
737960	742120	He how does that feel to him thinking about that? Oh, not good. Not good at all
743000	749940	Because basically you were under a compulsion and you had no control over your body that you now have control over but
750320	756760	That has to make you wonder how long do you have control over your body? And how easy was it for it to be taken over?
756760	761440	However, you guys are all back up to full hit points
763040	769820	And your luck will start where it was last time except for we discussed luck
769820	775620	That was awarded that was not used which is plus five for me and plus ten for Joe. I believe so
775620	780860	Yeah, so I think I have 35. Does that sound right? It does have we ever canonically described
781660	783660	John Lee Kevin Moore's
784260	790820	Appearance I mean not a whole lot. I think you have full reigns in episode 76 here to
791260	793740	Tell us what he looks like going into this arc
794500	796500	Sam Elliott and Roadhouse. Oh
798740	800740	That's it that's I thought you were gonna
803060	808740	Hell yeah, what a man. Oh, yeah Taylor and I watched Roadhouse like a month ago
808740	814580	I still have never seen either one of us had ever seen it. I also watched it for the first time like last fall
814620	816500	It's wild
816500	823740	Was it good? It's really fucking good. It's a watch. It is extremely entertaining. So absurd. I've only ever seen bits and pieces
823740	826300	I don't think I've ever said and watch the whole thing through an
826660	834060	Insanely like psychotic mob boss for no reason tries to take over this small, Missouri town. Oh, it's in Missouri Patrick
834060	836060	So, yep, Patrick Swayze
836940	844040	Who is like a world-famous bouncer within the world's like the John wick of bouncers
847700	853620	So he he gets a job like at a bar in the town to clean it up and he moves into
854340	856340	this loft above
856580	861220	Is he above the mechanic shop or on like a farm or something?
861500	868780	Anyway for whatever reason he rents this loft that ends up being directly across this like small river from
869660	871660	villains mansion
872780	876580	Villains just out there like watching him while he does fucking Tai Chi in the yard and shit
876580	881220	There's a lot of shots of him doing Tai Chi in the yard. It's great. What about our
881980	884620	sanity so your sanity is going to
885620	886780	Start
886780	889820	Wherever it was when you woke up last time
889980	895700	Which is where it was when you went into the mausoleum the first time I was afraid you were gonna say that
896340	900980	What are you at? I'm at 19 with a breaking point of 18. I'm always like destined to
901580	903740	Snap every time we wake up in here
903740	910160	So I'm gonna give you 2d 20 unnatural for what you learned in the last go-around
910460	913420	About the unnatural dope dope dope. So roll them up
913940	917460	Luke what'd you get a 15 and a 7 ooh?
918340	920340	22 on top of what did you have before?
921100	928860	28 so I'm at 50. That's it's a lot maybe yeah. All right. I've done what I did. So here we are
929740	931740	I mean I can reroll
932580	938300	No, I like it wouldn't work. I said things and now they're they're happening Joe. What do we get?
938300	944340	I got a 13 and a 6 that gives me 19 added on to a 30 makes it 49, right?
944780	948300	Right there with you, bud. Oh and Thomas took his webcam off
948940	956580	To show us his role because 17 and 11. Is that an 11 making up for last time?
956900	958900	Yeah, it's a 77
960460	964180	17 and 11 so 28 on top of what did you have last time?
964820	972100	16 16 so coming in hot with 44 well done. So a reminder. We're all very unnatural now reminder
972340	974740	You can use that skill at any time
974740	980460	But if you fail on the roll, you're gonna take a 1d6 sanity check not a check a hit
980820	986640	But you still get good stuff even from a fail. That is true. That is my favorite mechanic of the unnatural
987380	992700	Okay, I want to peek out of the mausoleum. Do I see that old lady still?
993580	997860	No, when you peek out you do not see the old lady there but
998700	1002940	Jumping back into the character sheet and the mechanics for one quick second
1003940	1010140	Basically in Delta green and rules is written when you go on a mission and you finish the mission
1010420	1012420	There are these like qualifiers
1012780	1020980	that basically say like you gain this much sanity if you complete this task and so I'm gonna give you guys a
1021860	1023860	D10 of sanity
1024420	1026420	shit for
1026420	1027660	killing
1027660	1032580	Marvin glass hell, yeah, the knowledge that that entity is
1033420	1035420	No longer is
1035860	1037860	worth 10 sanity
1042780	1045540	You got one I roll the fucking one
1045540	1046980	I
1046980	1048980	Need so bad
1049180	1050180	Thomas
1050180	1057580	The webcam and roll the 10 Wowzers live. Yeah, I got a 60 so right in the mid there
1057580	1062940	So we're getting this for having killed Marvin glass. Are we is there nothing for the last arc?
1063740	1070180	So that was just his first you lose whatever you just rolled. Yeah last one. Well, we killed we killed
1070180	1074700	Um, well, no, he killed himself didn't he Bruce Robin like that was our
1075860	1080200	Ostensibly our mission our actions caused him to die. So that should be worth
1081700	1089540	So if you guys could argue that like why would killing Bruce Robin like why would that help you mentally? Oh
1090180	1091860	Yeah
1091860	1094500	Yeah, cuz you gave you gave us this cuz killing Marvin
1094940	1100380	Felt like a way right or as maybe killing Bruce Bruce killing himself in front of you. Did that feel like a win?
1101500	1105220	No, I was that didn't mean to sound like such a dick
1110060	1112060	Did you guys like that
1118340	1124260	Sorry, but yeah, no if nothing about that entire arc made you feel like better about the situation
1124500	1126500	Then probably not
1126700	1128700	Yeah
1129740	1131740	But the Marvin thing was cool
1133460	1135940	Hey, you got one at least better than what you had
1136580	1139940	Yeah, Bruce Robin was a ruthless
1141460	1148700	Capitalist who prayed on on the lower half of society to to harvest as well
1148700	1155420	However, he had just recently made a pretty big statement by giving all of his employees
1156140	1160820	Vacation time while he worked diligently to make all of his companies
1161660	1168020	Better for the employees. So with with higher pay and some people were saying that yeah, I don't know
1168500	1173660	He reminded me of my brother and I hated my brother. So him dying made me feel even better
1173660	1175140	I
1175140	1180220	Was just like every lost human soul makes me gain sanity
1181100	1185020	Yeah, is that still a thing though? I thought we were done with all our so
1185540	1190060	Yeah, we are gonna pull a clean slate on any phobias or manias
1191280	1198380	Starting up into this. However, when you hit those breaking points, you will be receiving new manias and phobias and I just
1199380	1201740	It's gonna happen and I don't want you to stack them
1201740	1208460	So, how about that and we back and we back and we back so Keith goes and looks out the out the mausoleum
1208660	1213740	And does not see the woman in the wheelchair and when you see the placement of the Sun
1214220	1218460	It is later than it was last time. What's your watch say Clark?
1218460	1224940	It says three three, it says 3 p.m. Which if you remember, I believe last time we woke up in here
1225460	1230100	It was one I think. Yeah, Zach's holding up a one finger
1230500	1235660	Yeah, it was one o'clock didn't we want to do something that I want to say for previously we thought about
1236260	1238980	Hunkering down and just waiting for us to see
1239300	1245940	Planet juggernaut pop out of the ground and then we would go into Marvin's lair so that we could retrieve the gun
1246220	1251660	Back from him and maybe the camera also is the camera with Marvin right now, right?
1251660	1252140	Yeah
1252140	1259540	so I look in the direction where I think the pit is is there any kind of chaos on the city skyline from that direction when
1259540	1261980	you guys walk out you walk into a
1262820	1266500	Pretty chilly December 6th at 3 p.m
1266500	1272380	The Sun is lower in the sky than it was the last time you're out here with these three dead men
1273300	1275700	quote-unquote men in black tactical gear
1276420	1282180	At your feet and a crawfish boil still going still pretty hot hot fire
1282780	1289100	It hasn't gone out yet looking out you notice that there maybe should be an old woman in a wheelchair
1289180	1293220	But it is quite a bit later. She was moving slow, but maybe not that slow
1293380	1297460	She's had time to scoot away by now at least out of this area for sure
1297460	1297780	Yeah
1297780	1305260	Or it's hopefully someone's come to help her one would assume unless her family abandoned her at the funeral of Ari
1305660	1307660	Manstein that'd be sad
1309420	1313220	Only you have the power to decide if this world gets that sad Zach
1315260	1317260	It's really not a choice
1317380	1322540	It's just what happens it happens every day open your
1324140	1331700	If you're not angry you're not paying attention Thomas guys what what time did we fight planet juggernaut?
1332400	1337540	Okay, if we if we popped out of the mausoleum at like one o'clock well
1337540	1342580	It was one o'clock the last one or the one before that it's three o'clock right now. It was one o'clock
1343180	1348700	Both times previously 11 a.m.. Then 1 o'clock then 3 o'clock. Oh, I see a pattern here
1349380	1351380	so if we popped out at
1351420	1353300	11 for our
1353300	1358140	Excursion into Marvin's base. I don't know how long were we there were we there for I mean
1358140	1362640	We did quite a bit you went to Jim Cook's house, then you went to get weapons
1362640	1368120	Maybe and then you went to the glass compound we fought the fish men
1368240	1373480	We were knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time while we waited and there was like a waiting room
1374000	1379240	Before we fought planet juggernaut, so we don't exactly know how long we were out for either
1380040	1385680	So I guess the best guess is that it's like late tonight is when planet juggernaut would pop
1385680	1391220	That's what I would say or early tomorrow morning even I don't know we would we would remember if it was if the Sun was
1391220	1395640	Up when we popped out. Can you tell us that oh the Sun was not up so it was within
1396240	1400320	24 hours from now hopefully unless we were knocked out for days before we
1400600	1407560	But that would be hopefully not don't you guys know everything in this show happens like very quickly no
1409040	1415640	So as I'm looking out for the old lady and scratching my foot. I realized that Maggie is exed out
1416480	1422460	Guys that just leaves true until D. Do you do you think we should go back to contention?
1422460	1428060	That's the last place that we know that we saw drew right anybody see him
1428060	1430880	I haven't seen him since contention and then Tildy is uh
1432020	1435500	Well, I think we're gonna need the gun for that one. Oh, you're right
1435500	1440940	So we need to wait around until we can get our hands on that gun and camera if our luck holds out
1441180	1444060	We could do drew now and then
1444780	1448940	Next time we wake up in the mausoleum. It'll be later. It should be five o'clock
1448980	1453100	I don't know that opens up the possibility that we'll have to kill ourselves to reset ourselves
1453100	1458380	And I don't know if I want to live with that on my mind for a while if the time comes
1458380	1462620	I will kill you both. There we go. What happens if we don't reset this time?
1465100	1467940	What have you got to live for now besides saving the world
1467940	1475060	I mean dying just isn't always like the first thing I want to do just don't die then but then we won't reset
1475060	1477020	It's like Douglas
1477060	1481860	Adams or Shel Silverstein said flying is just
1487660	1494180	Fine is just well what Tim McGraw said all day. I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
1496400	1503240	So, let's go do it eight seconds later, I need you to roll alertness someone I got 60
1503240	1505460	I got a 70 I also have 60
1507020	1508060	I
1508060	1509540	rolled a
1509540	1511540	16 I pass
1511740	1517580	out of the corner of your eye you hear a smell and it's familiar and
1518660	1520780	What color is it bright yellow and?
1521500	1523260	You get the feeling
1523260	1527740	That creature that visited you asking about the book
1528660	1533480	Is nearby or will be here in a second and you need to act right now?
1534360	1537280	What do you do I tell the guy I tell the guys
1538000	1541880	Do you remember that thing that thing that the thing that screamed at me and it was asking for a book
1541880	1544960	I think it's coming back. I think it's coming back. We got it. We got to get out of here. Let's go
1544960	1548120	Let's sprint to our car. Oh shit. Do we have cars?
1548120	1551120	We might not have cars our old selves might have taken our car
1551120	1555760	We took the cruiser last time I think or did we take the Accord?
1555760	1558040	No, we took the car that Maggie brought us, right?
1558040	1563760	So there should still be a cruiser here right or my car we can steal a car if needs be
1563960	1570540	We had two cars here last time and we only took one of them. Who's got the lowest. Hold on. Let me call Enterprise
1571920	1573920	Am I wrong?
1574000	1579040	Yeah, there were three cars in total one that Maggie brought one that I drove there and one that you drew
1579040	1582760	Yeah, and last time we all took one together Maggie went somewhere else
1582800	1586320	So last time you left zero cars in the parking lot
1586360	1591040	Well, how many cars are there now? That's that is to be decided when you get to the parking lot
1591040	1593240	I suppose so you're saying that we took two cars
1593240	1600080	I think we all took one car the first time you left the cemetery you took the cruiser and the second time you left the
1600080	1602440	Cemetery you took the car that Clark came in
1603000	1610280	Okay, so okay and that makes John Road with Rosemary, right? Okay, so if we go to the parking lot, what do we see?
1610640	1611720	Well
1611720	1616520	Were you guys all trying to decide in that moment if you should go to the parking lot?
1616840	1622080	Because you didn't know whether there was a car there. Unfortunately due to our dithering. I think we I
1622680	1627120	Guess we could say it was in character, but I told you guys like we needed to go so I figured we were going
1627120	1632000	Yeah, yeah, but then we just sat around on our asses talking about whether or not there were cars there
1632000	1635740	I feel like Joe Luke and Thomas did that. I don't know if we would have done that in character
1635740	1641420	We would I said run so I feel like we would have run for Keith and character who says run I start running towards I
1641500	1644020	Think that there's still a car there. So sure. Yeah
1647140	1651660	As you guys are running through these tombs these above-ground
1653300	1654740	mausoleums
1654740	1659540	You need to make a couple quick turns to get out in the fastest way to the parking lot that you know
1659540	1662460	And as you're running you see right in front of you
1663300	1665300	There's an old woman in a wheelchair
1665780	1670740	and she looks at you with massive eyes and she's just like
1677980	1681340	And she starts crying out for help
1687940	1693740	I take her with I get behind her wheelchair and start running her towards the parking lot. You gotta come with us, ma'am
1693900	1700900	We'll get you out of here amazing and right behind you as you guys are nearing the turn for the parking lot
1701260	1703260	you hear this like
1707060	1710380	And if you look back while you're running you see that
1711020	1714860	materializing behind you and not in your way is this
1715500	1721660	Massive gaunt creature wearing a black suit and it has no snow hair whatsoever
1721980	1723980	On its head
1724100	1727480	If you could see its knuckles, there's no hair on its knuckles
1728260	1733860	Certainly, no eyebrows. How about down there any down there? You can't see the down there, but you
1734420	1740180	Looking at the rest of this from the rest of it might assume that it is both hairless and that
1740860	1744980	You would be unaware of what its genitalia could look like
1746020	1747260	Kendall
1747260	1750580	It could be anything. I mean it's got a Ken doll down there
1752660	1759980	Like just the smooth taint. Oh, I thought you meant like it's smooth, but there's a kindle attached to the front
1764100	1770820	Just like stuck on there that would that would be dope and you guys are running but then this thing's behind you and it cries
1770820	1772820	Out what do its eyes look like?
1775940	1778260	Its eyes are slits
1778900	1783180	That when they open they open from the bottom instead of from the top and
1784060	1787700	when they like slap down onto its cheeks
1788780	1791980	You see big big eyes that are
1792500	1799260	The pupils are red and the part that is white on humans is also white
1799260	1801260	I
1806340	1813140	Hand the old lady my gun and I'm like you ever used one of these boy howdy she's gonna roll sanity
1817920	1819920	She rolled a 77 oh
1820900	1827880	Hell yes. Oh, that's bad properly. No, this old lady's got it together. She she has 85 sanity
1827920	1833120	Oh sweet, so it's a critical success. So she cocks the gun. Yeah. Oh
1834680	1838360	Interesting, so she cut I was using these before you were born
1840480	1842480	She's instantly on board with this
1844760	1849520	Justin come on in we just got our new tank ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, let's call it
1849520	1851600	Hey tell Justin get in here and play an old lady
1851880	1853880	She
1854800	1860680	Cocks the gun immediately and I just wanted to provide cover fire over our shoulders
1862400	1867920	And when you make it out into the parking lot you see that there are
1868560	1871960	No cars here in this parking lot
1874200	1876200	Until a red
1876640	1880000	2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse comes flying
1880640	1886360	Across all the designated parking spots in this parking lot toward you
1887720	1893600	Who's in it? Is it baby driver and behind the wheel you can see drew Andrews
1903080	1905080	Now
1905080	1908360	Unfortunately, I've never been so excited. I need you all the real power
1914620	1916620	Shit
1918120	1925220	That's gonna be a no from me dog, I rolled over my power same 79 on a 50 67 on a 60
1925760	1928080	87 on a six. I rolled the 22
1929040	1931040	Fuck you
1931920	1936280	Unless that's good then. Hell yeah drew had an 11 sanity. So he also critically feels
1937640	1944920	You all here. Hello subject Clark Theodore Bishop and you all
1948480	1950480	Freeze
1950760	1957880	You all turn around even all of John Lee Kevin Moore with all of the wheelchair just spins you around like you're standing on a
1958000	1963200	Platform I am here to offer apologies and to put your minds to rest
1964240	1968360	Order has not been lost, but we ran into a glitch
1969160	1974200	Surrounding a vector with the same genetic code as Clark Theodore Bishop
1974360	1980680	But Clark Theodore Bishop does not have a twin. This is the glitch. I am here to
1981360	1982320	investigate
1982320	1984320	subject Clark Theodore Bishop
1984800	1989600	Subject John Lee petty more the third subject Ashley Keith beans
1990400	1993400	What can you tell me about this vector?
1997480	2004520	Your name is Ashley my face gets super red I'm like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about
2004520	2006520	Oh
2008400	2015600	That's something I shoot I shoot at him I get super mad super flustered and I shoot at him that's in line
2015600	2017600	That's what you did last time
2018280	2024440	All right, yeah, I go ahead and roll power again because you'll have to win a contest of power
2027480	2032840	Fucking hell dude, what'd you get? I'm rolling rocks. I rolled a 33 Oh
2034520	2039880	I got an eight. I'm sorry Keith Vigna as you pull the gun out
2040280	2047560	You hold it like you're aimed ready to fire and your finger will not pull the trigger. I
2048240	2050240	Need you to roll sanity. I
2052600	2054600	Got a 99
2054600	2056600	Oh
2060560	2067960	So, yeah days over my power, yes, I believe it is oh dang it looks like I wasn't recording I guess we got to start
2071120	2073120	Dang
2074560	2076560	Restart checkpoint
2076840	2081840	You guys all just pull guns on each other. See come back at five. Thanks
2084600	2090880	Thanks for clueing us into our strategy my finger won't move when I try to fire it and I look at
2091440	2093440	I look at the old lady
2094280	2096280	Why are you doing this to me?
2102560	2107760	She won't let me shoot him and I look panicked at my two friends, but also
2108400	2112980	Suspiciously, you've got to respect your elders and I'm sure she has her reasons
2113020	2115400	But also have you considered that it's the weird
2116540	2123740	Future man doing it. Yeah, I'm with John on this one Keith. I think that it's the tall guy over there. That's making us
2123740	2125380	Maybe you don't want me to shoot him
2125380	2132600	I mean I that's also true at this moment you realize that none of your mouths have been moving and you've been having this
2132900	2134900	conversation
2134900	2136900	Mentally, I
2137300	2141300	Need you guys to roll. I'm sorry tall guy. Did you just hear all that?
2142980	2144980	Oh
2146740	2148740	94
2148780	2156580	97 oh boy. What are we rolling? I need Joe and Thomas Clark and John both lose one sanity
2157500	2160420	However, Keith Vigna with that critical failure
2161140	2163220	You're also gonna lose one sanity
2163740	2169020	Cool, because you lose the maximum sanity, which is one for that
2169020	2175940	Well, okay, so I had that buffer of one so I don't break right now. Oh nice
2178900	2186620	Yeah, and hold on for just one scene longer and as you guys realize that you were having this conversation mentally oh wait
2187900	2192180	That was a sanity roll and I rolled over my yes, you did same
2192180	2194540	I don't know if okay
2194540	2199740	You'll have to explain how what kind of hold this creature has on me because I might not be able to do it's got a hold
2199740	2201380	Enough to where you won't be able to do anything
2201380	2204840	So just describe what it looks like when you try to do what you want to do
2204840	2208780	But you can't do what you want to do. I feel like this happened before
2209780	2213680	Discribed it as yeah, I just kind of boil from the inside
2213680	2217980	You see my face turn red and like sheer rage over my face
2217980	2221940	It's physically hurting me from the inside out that I can't do anything
2222180	2227980	Meanwhile Kevin is freaking out picks his can he move his body just like minutely
2229780	2232200	Well, then you can tell that if he could move his body
2233100	2234780	He would be freaking out
2234780	2241900	But every part of him is like twitching super tense muscles and the most concerned look comes across his face
2243020	2247560	And you hear him thinking this ain't right. This ain't me
2247560	2252160	This ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son. It ain't me
2253800	2257920	As you're all essentially just like in suspended motion
2258440	2263000	This thing thinks toward you and you feel
2264160	2266600	release and relief in
2267600	2274240	Your bones you can feel it reverberate. Do not do not be afraid
2274960	2276960	Do not be afraid
2277560	2281240	Hey, hey, I'm not a family on the shore
2282920	2290680	I'm giving you relief here. Welcome to fucking welcome to fucking welcome to the fucking show kids
2292560	2296960	And as you're all calm you see this woman for the first time maybe
2297680	2303180	Ever that you've seen this woman because every single time you've come across her she is looked so worried
2303300	2309500	So afraid almost like on the verge of death with how stressed out she is and you see her
2310460	2312620	immediately come to peace and
2313220	2315140	in that moment
2315140	2318140	she just exhales and
2318900	2325060	Freezes I try to take the gun from her hand. Her hand is kind of stuck to it a little bit. I
2325700	2327300	pry her
2327300	2329780	Frozen fingers off just because the bad circulation
2329780	2331780	I
2333300	2335300	Snap
2338460	2340580	No, but yeah, so I
2340580	2345260	Struggle with the gun for a little bit that rested from her frozen hand and and you have it
2345260	2351100	I don't know why you would need a gun in your hand with how relaxed and chill you are right now as this thing's
2351100	2357540	Like what? Can you tell me about this vector and you hear a screech behind you as
2358260	2360680	Drew whips this red
2361620	2366380	2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse right up behind you guys and drew looks
2367020	2371820	And he sees this creature looking at you and he slowly starts
2372700	2375060	Driving in reverse, but just really slowly
2375300	2379860	He goes about 20 yards and then he just stops and he's just watching
2379860	2383160	I try to beam the thought to drew run him down
2383680	2387000	Run them over you need not have those
2387640	2390080	Aggressions we are in time of peace
2390080	2397200	I will tell you what will help you if you will help me Clark's ears perk up at that for sure
2397280	2400520	What what do you need and what can you offer?
2400520	2407420	I am looking for information about a glitch in regards to subject Clark Theodore Bishop
2407420	2411720	This glitch is not a twin but has the same genetic makeup
2411760	2416360	I can't help but notice that you've abandoned the numbers format that you were using last time
2416360	2421800	We saw you are you are you the same thing that we saw last time? I am four three six two nine
2421800	2426200	I wanted to make sure that you are more comfortable
2426880	2428880	DC FBI is what it was
2429680	2435320	I've been I've been through some stuff. I know those numbers now you does that does that mean your DC FBI?
2435320	2437840	Is that is that what those numbers mean? We are
2442560	2444560	We are I thought you were going to continue
2448520	2450520	We are blah blah blah blah
2452680	2458340	D DC FBI does that is is that the kind of like is that
2458960	2465480	District of Columbia Federal Bureau of Investigation. Is that what that stands for? So here's a thing
2465480	2467520	I need you all the real power
2472320	2474320	Three
2474920	2480200	Ooh a 25 I pass I got a 40 on a 50. Holy shit. We all passed
2480680	2485040	God, okay. Yeah, and I failed. Yeah, look how the
2485920	2487920	table and so
2488080	2490360	That will be important here in a second
2491000	2496200	District of Columbia your nation's capital. What's up with your voice?
2496360	2500040	This is the voice that I have to communicate with
2500640	2504960	What a different voice make you more comfortable. I guess
2505680	2513800	Physically, what are you? I am NOT like you that is apparent and you know that I'm not trying to other eyes you in any
2513800	2520440	Way, but are you like a future man, or are you some kind of space creature? I am simply better
2521280	2529200	That's an opinion it is not it is fact I am here to begin. Oh
2531560	2533560	I thought there was more again
2534800	2542080	Again begin what we are myriad and we are here to advance. Oh
2543640	2545640	You stuff in there again. Okay. Gotcha
2546240	2548240	Clark says to the fellas
2548840	2555400	Myriad you you remember myriad it's that's the we saw that symbol. It's the double helices and we saw the
2556560	2560600	robot man at James the mill workers house had that on his crotch and
2561400	2566040	There was a ring that Keith are you do you still have that ring around my neck?
2566040	2572080	I have the ring on a my shoestring show him that ring. I guess yeah, I hold it up
2572080	2577680	Actually, I want to put it on. Can I can I move? Yes. Okay, I put it on my right ring finger
2578240	2582680	And hold it out to him. We are a myriad as well
2582680	2588560	And this thing looks at you and holds out its hand toward you subject Jim
2588720	2592280	James cook you are not you are
2592800	2596960	Subject Ashley Keith beans. What is you do? Why?
2604520	2607880	Hello subject Ashley Keith beans
2608400	2610400	Why do you have this?
2611600	2613600	Ring
2613840	2616720	I've always had it roll power
2620520	2622520	25 on a 50
2623960	2631640	Failed you have always had it for a while. Obviously, that's just Jim cook in the body of Keith beans
2632320	2637480	Yeah subject Jim James cook you are still alive. This is excellent news
2639240	2641240	I
2643520	2650280	Whisper in Keith's ear. Why don't you tell him that we're your friends and you need him to restate your primary mission
2650640	2658000	To brief us on what's going on. I look at the thing. Did you catch that? I am sorry what he said
2658320	2660320	can you I
2661320	2666280	Need you to restate my mission to make sure that you're who you say you are
2668240	2670240	I
2675360	2677360	Bubble gum tree
2680200	2682200	Does that work
2683480	2688080	Subject Jim James cook before your death you were working on
2688800	2691540	operation stapler Android program
2691900	2698500	Respect to cut down on cost and sell to private companies like the city asylum
2698500	2705380	Are you still working on this? I approach the creature and get really close to it
2705380	2707820	I don't know if these guys
2708580	2710580	Know about that yet. So
2711180	2713180	But yeah
2715260	2720260	Then why did you ask me to state your brief loudly
2721660	2725480	I didn't say loudly. I only talk in one volume
2726540	2730580	Well, as long as they can know we're good to go. They're they're helping me out here
2730580	2735740	I assumed when you asked that they were not our enemy. Yeah, I'm still working on it
2735860	2740780	Just to make sure I can trust you. What is project stapler again?
2741860	2744140	Well, I just told you just told us
2744660	2751340	It was a merely operation to cut costs on Android creations and sell them to companies
2751620	2753620	including the contention orphanage
2754340	2755860	asylum
2755860	2762220	Contention asylum which one city asylum the city asylum. Hey Keith. I'm I mean a
2762900	2769460	Jim will you ask this thing if it's a robot? Is this a robot? You're not a robot
2769460	2773100	Are you I am NOT a robot, but you're an Android
2773100	2778240	Why would you assume that I am either robot or Android I am neither
2778440	2784360	So you're an alien I am from where I am from which is I do not know
2784360	2788160	So, how do you know you're neither robot nor Android nor alien? I am
2789120	2791120	alone
2792380	2797400	Technically in your definitions an alien, that's awesome, man
2798080	2802400	That's really cool. Well, so yeah, Jim Jim's just plugging away there
2803040	2805960	At that at that project stapler
2805960	2810120	Yeah, I ran into a little bit of a mix-up with my old body in this one
2810120	2812700	But uh, tell me more about the vector
2812760	2819040	We are on the same team and you are working with subject Clark Theodore Bishop
2819040	2825580	Please tell me more about the vector. What do you want to know? It just seems to be a little time-traveling thing
2825620	2827620	Yes. Yeah, nothing too big
2827780	2833700	Hey, maybe we'll tell you a little bit more about the vector if you can tell us about operation three ring binder and
2834500	2836500	hole puncher and hole puncher
2843540	2847800	Little whisper thing that he does every now and then does that sound like speech it sounds like yeah
2847800	2851320	He's communicating with some sort of speech some sort of uplink
2851420	2856500	Okay, when I showed him the ring did it like glow or do anything? No, I
2857060	2863220	Am unfamiliar with operation hole puncher or operation three ring binder
2863220	2866860	And I he meant that or is he know and that yeah, can I he meant it as well?
2866860	2869420	Oh, yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and roll him it
2870340	2874060	Fail 76 on a 50. I got a 75 on a 80
2874940	2879660	75 on an 80 would tell you you are not exactly
2880700	2882300	familiar with
2882300	2884300	non-human intelligence, however
2885300	2887100	If you were guessing
2887100	2890660	You would say that it didn't talk differently
2890660	2894420	So it's either been lying the whole time or telling the truth the whole time
2894860	2898740	Probably sounds like a real straight shooter Clark is gonna address the creature
2898740	2903940	Can you can you tell us how you how you and Jim are related? What how do you guys know each other?
2903940	2909480	Jim here works for myriad. How long has he been doing that? How long has he been with myriad?
2909480	2914840	Why do you do not know things about him he is right here
2914840	2921440	I'm Jim is just a real hard guy to get to open up and we've been working with him for a while and we you know
2921880	2928640	One of subject Jim James Cook's best qualities is his inability to open up. So you understand
2928640	2932360	so we just you know, we we really come to appreciate the feller and
2933240	2937800	Well, we just want to know a little bit more about him. So maybe on his birthday we can do something special
2938460	2943160	You know with with a personal touch what have you done on his previous birthdays?
2943160	2946760	Well, he hasn't told us when it is so we'd like to do something at all
2955360	2962960	Jim cook I gotta make that shorter some I'll speed it up in post just replace it with modem sounds
2962960	2964960	Hahahaha
2966080	2970000	Subject Jim James Cook does the same thing on his birthday
2970800	2974960	Every birthday for the past decade on his birthday
2975800	2982920	December 1st, he always goes to his favorite pie shop in the city called
2984800	2986800	Prairie pie, but it's like
2987760	2989760	Prairie pie. Yes
2989760	2991760	And
2992160	3000560	It's yeah, it's two folded hands on the outside in a triangle making that's like a pie slice
3005480	3011320	We have a local pie maker in Springfield called Prairie pie like on the Prairie like home and
3012040	3018720	It's the best pie. Anyway, I have a piece of the honey sea salt in my fridge right now every December 1st
3019160	3021560	Subject Jim James Cook's birthday
3021560	3027240	He goes to Prairie pie in the city before walking back home
3027240	3031240	I walk back home to contention. No Jim lives in the city
3031240	3032160	Oh, yeah
3032160	3039640	What do you know in exchange for this information to make subject Jim James Cook's birthday better now?
3039640	3043000	We know to get him pie. What do you know about the vector? Oh
3043520	3049840	Nothing really during my mishap when I had to switch bodies I a lot of info got kind of a
3050600	3054840	Jar-bolt around my head. I there's some things I just don't remember
3055360	3057280	Subject Jim James Cook
3057280	3065320	Are you in the body of subject Ashley Keith beans in order to repair the relationship regarding?
3065880	3067880	operation San Ferra blum
3068920	3070920	Yes
3071800	3073800	Precisely
3075320	3077320	Clark nudges Keith
3078000	3083640	Like I don't I can't do it without him hearing so I just nudge you after you say just yes
3083640	3090200	And you stop talking. I nudge you well, how do you suggest we move forward Jim?
3090200	3094840	You don't you don't remember very much about that mission. Do you you should have him remind you what it is? Yeah
3095240	3098640	Yeah, no, I mean Jim obviously remembers it pretty well
3098640	3103640	But what he did say is before he made a move he wanted to consult with us tactically
3104240	3108320	But yeah, you did want you to fill us in on that right? Yeah that way they know
3108840	3116360	So we yeah really if subject just James is taken care of I suppose
3116400	3120660	We can move forward in what way sorry we're playing catch-up
3120660	3126640	Will you describe who subject just James is to us? I mean out of character. Do you know yeah?
3127000	3133320	It's James the mill worker that's why we've called him James the mill worker forever cuz he's just James I am curious
3133480	3136440	I will give you information about
3137120	3143580	Operation San Ferra blum if you will first give me information about the vector
3143840	3149520	Clark Clark's gonna step forward toward it. Do you do you know you called it a glitch earlier?
3149520	3153200	Do you would you have a running theory on what this new vector is?
3153920	3158440	I'm gonna be straight with you a scary man that we don't exactly know for sure
3159440	3164880	We've got our own theories. Do you have a theory our working theory is a clone?
3165480	3171280	Yeah, I mean I guess that the clones old though, so wouldn't this one be the clone we've seen
3171280	3175320	We've seen this vector that I believe you're speaking of and it looks like me
3175520	3180600	But it seems like an older version of me is it helping or hurting I?
3181480	3189200	Like to think it's helping it seems it seems helpful so far seems more healthy than hurting does it seem to have an agenda
3189960	3191240	Yeah
3191240	3198460	Yes, yes, it does. What is this agenda? It's cryptic to say the to say the least yeah that remains unclear
3198880	3205160	Where was this vector seen last from your perspective? I point behind it
3205160	3207460	Yeah, I point at the mausoleum. It was
3207460	3209900	You get he I was in there
3209900	3213580	Oh, we're calling him Clark old Clark old was in in there
3213580	3217760	And then and then he wasn't he he doesn't he disappeared on us. What time?
3218340	3222940	11 or that's when we woke up so like 9 or 10, maybe yeah, thank you
3222940	3226660	I have decided many things during our
3227460	3229020	conversation one
3229020	3235440	Subject Ashley Keith beans you are not subject Jim James cook number two
3235720	3242340	Just wait a minute there you all are clearly working in a way that you do not understand
3242920	3246860	What your causalities are creating in this time?
3246860	3251960	I need for this reason too, and I am sorry wipe your memories
3254120	3259760	And it reaches out its hand I pull my gun out and try to shoot it so here
3259760	3265060	Let's think about what happens this thing reaches out its arm as Keith Vigna pulls out his gun
3266160	3268680	you see it like struggling as
3269160	3271480	We rolled the power check earlier
3271480	3277440	And you all succeeded it thinks that it succeeded and leaves it has
3277920	3281040	Completed its task and it disappears out of existence
3281680	3289200	But you all remember everything tight holy shit, and it went in a way different way than I expected it to
3289200	3297480	Yeah, we pumped that alien all his information and as you guys turn around and I'm singing like a canary
3298680	3303600	Let's go kill Tildy does Sam Farah bloom mean anything to you guys I?
3304720	3307520	Don't think it. No. I don't have no idea
3308400	3312540	If I google it does anything come up go ahead and roll computer
3315240	3317040	87 on a 20
3317040	3321500	No when you google Sam Farah bomb nothing comes up. I spell it wrong
3323520	3325520	I'd like to try as well
3327520	3329520	Fuck 60 other
3329520	3336200	Clark doesn't have any computer skill zero percent zero percent that makes sense yep. That was my design
3338280	3343380	Clark only uses his phone to text and just barely gets through it
3343740	3344860	You
3344860	3349460	Hear the car pull up right behind you it scares me, so I aim my gun at Drew
3350300	3354420	For just a second until I realize who it is Clark tries to like no no no
3354740	3359060	Throw a hand onto the gun to put it down to the ground. No. It's it's Keith. It's true. It's true
3359060	3364180	Look, it's true is the old lady still here in the wheelchair. There is a woman's body
3364540	3368420	Is it alive body? Why why did you say that Zach?
3369780	3371780	Is it is she dead?
3372780	3374500	When she
3374500	3375720	finally
3375720	3382340	Finally for the first time in over a decade had no pain and no fear in her heart and in her mind
3383100	3385100	She felt ready to go
3386460	3392300	Did she die fuck we killed her December 6 we have no way of knowing that so we're
3394980	3398660	Holy shit that that alien must have scared her death
3399660	3406820	Oh, maybe he did something terrible to her mind drew pulls up in the 2001 red Mitsubishi Eclipse
3407140	3408980	rolls down the window
3408980	3415860	Hello contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me. Oh boy. It is good to see you drew
3415860	3421240	What's contention like true? I'm so happy you're still around we were calling you
3421740	3426100	We weren't the fastest were calling you earlier, but not now
3426100	3429100	Good to see you drew
3456100	3458100	Oh
3486100	3488100	You
