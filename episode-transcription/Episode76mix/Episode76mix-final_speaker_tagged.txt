117.48 132.72 speaker1  We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen
126.48 246.32 speaker0  Faust something fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends We're starting to see more discussion around the greater delta green cannon as well as game running tips and general show stuff and whatnot And while I'm telling y'all to stop by things check out our discord and twitch but with a higher pitched voice Suspicious to keep tabs on these Suspicious happenings with those suspicious pretending pod people go to twitch.tv Slash pretending pod streams wolf bless you chuckling boy I don't care who you are where you're from what you did as long as you tag us on Instagram or Twitter at Pretending pod or write a five-star review on Apple podcasts or if you're a patron over on patreon.com pretending pod go check out the poll and vote on what the boys will be playing next live streaming in the Dennison on Wednesday April 29th at 6 p.m. Central time hurry over and vote as the poll will close Sunday evening So Zach can have some prep time and I have a note here from my producer for all you patrons from splash Pennsylvania fast-passed holders to clinkers daycare alumni and everyone in between Dearly beloved.

244.32 254.60 speaker1  humanoid figure a
252.32 304.96 speaker0  None of that made a lick of sense to me But that doesn't mean I'm not hungry filling me up as always is kudzu with no
302.96 369.48 speaker2  Kind of we're pretending to be So I did tell you last time that we played that the next time that we played You would be back as Clark Bishop Keith Vigna Remember You are now
365.60 389.48 speaker3  I feel like it's the best portmanteau to describe portmanteau The best portmanteau Will you beef up my stats? Can I get cool stats?
387.48 431.56 speaker2  Well you cool stats, please Okay, yeah, that's fine give yourself a plus 10 to strength and Constitution and a negative 10 to dexterity and Keith Vigna do the same plus 10 to the base, right so that Thomas when you see your character in a dream in the mirror what version is it? What does he look like?
428.00 437.98 speaker3  Not like the from the first episode of pretending to be people a new hope
433.72 729.64 speaker2  So that is the version that you all see when you see yourselves existing in An infinite darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you out of your own bodies floating in this vast nothingness you see Keith Vigna open a door and Tildy be Mitchell is there on the other side curled up in the fetal position and her body begins Deteriorating hastily like she has leprosy but in time-lapse However, she grows larger and larger with each passing moment Clark Bishop is seen handing an old piece of parchment to a young boy with a balloon shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black and immediately the boys feet catch fire and the fire grows and grows to consume the young black eyed boy and You hear three voices cry out in pain John Lee Pettymore Is crouched down crouched down He's crouched down staring at a television. That is a blank white screen He reaches out and touches the screen like Vanna White But instead of a letter popping up Clark Bishop's parents Eunice and Jerry the size of action figures Jump out of the television screen and run up John Lee Pettymore the fourth arm Climbing his shoulder and flinging themselves into John's head No, the bishops are going to disappear right into petty Moore's brain But they both get stuck halfway in their legs writhing about and flailing in this never-ending dreamscape Oily viscous sludge begins dripping and then spraying out of John Lee Pettymore the force head Where the bishops have lodged themselves and the ooze begins Collecting on a ground below now made of light and the ooze drip strips drips and then pours until a laminar flow Connects the head of John Lee Pettymore the fourth to a pool of this inky substance that begins shaping itself Into a large saucer, but as the pool grows the walls begin rising outward Creating an imposingly colossal Bowl and our view must back up leagues as this shape continues to form a mirror of what is now below the minuscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance continues to fill this thing's final form an incomprehensibly Then The three of you wake up you feel like you're in shock your stomach feels weirdly full and Your ears are ringing and you feel content, but it's dark and it's cold and it smells smells like Eyes begin to adjust and there's a pool of blood on the floor next to it is a coffin on the ground and this mausoleum And you look at each other Blood splatters speckled all over each one of you John Lee Kevin Moore and all black tactical gear Keith vigna and his brightly colored polo and boat shoes Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak and the shock Begins to wear off and you feel the searing pain you felt before on your chest on your back on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm and This time when you guys look around at each other and check each other's Skin, not only is the word Marvin crossed out But the word Maggie on each of your left feet is also crossed out. Hello again, boys
727.08 749.94 speaker3  Just piles of cash at the University
743.00 783.66 speaker2  Because basically you were under a compulsion and you had no control over your body that you now have control over but That has to make you wonder how long do you have control over your body? And how easy was it for it to be taken over?
781.66 793.74 speaker3  John Lee Kevin Moore's
791.26 816.50 speaker2  Tell us what he looks like going into this arc Sam Elliott and Roadhouse. Oh Hell yeah, what a man. Oh, yeah Taylor and I watched Roadhouse like a month ago
814.62 886.78 speaker3  It's wild Insanely like psychotic mob boss for no reason tries to take over this small, Missouri town. Oh, it's in Missouri Patrick So, yep, Patrick Swayze this loft above Is he above the mechanic shop or on like a farm or something? Anyway for whatever reason he rents this loft that ends up being directly across this like small river from
885.62 1046.98 speaker2  Start Wherever it was when you woke up last time Luke what'd you get a 15 and a 7 ooh? I mean I can reroll No, I like it wouldn't work. I said things and now they're they're happening Joe. What do we get? You can use that skill at any time But if you fail on the roll, you're gonna take a 1d6 sanity check not a check a hit Jumping back into the character sheet and the mechanics for one quick second Basically in Delta green and rules is written when you go on a mission and you finish the mission There are these like qualifiers that basically say like you gain this much sanity if you complete this task and so I'm gonna give you guys a D10 of sanity killing Marvin glass hell, yeah, the knowledge that that entity is No longer is worth 10 sanity
1045.54 1105.22 speaker1  I Need so bad Um, well, no, he killed himself didn't he Bruce Robin like that was our Yeah Yeah, cuz you gave you gave us this cuz killing Marvin
1101.50 1148.70 speaker2  No, I was that didn't mean to sound like such a dick Then probably not
1141.46 1160.82 speaker3  Capitalist who prayed on on the lower half of society to to harvest as well
1156.14 1175.14 speaker2  Vacation time while he worked diligently to make all of his companies Better for the employees. So with with higher pay and some people were saying that yeah, I don't know
1173.66 1198.38 speaker3  I
1191.28 1238.98 speaker2  Starting up into this. However, when you hit those breaking points, you will be receiving new manias and phobias and I just It's gonna happen and I don't want you to stack them And does not see the woman in the wheelchair and when you see the placement of the Sun
1236.26 1252.14 speaker1  Hunkering down and just waiting for us to see Planet juggernaut pop out of the ground and then we would go into Marvin's lair so that we could retrieve the gun Back from him and maybe the camera also is the camera with Marvin right now, right?
1251.66 1259.54 speaker3  Yeah
1252.14 1266.50 speaker1  so I look in the direction where I think the pit is is there any kind of chaos on the city skyline from that direction when
1262.82 1297.78 speaker2  Pretty chilly December 6th at 3 p.m The Sun is lower in the sky than it was the last time you're out here with these three dead men quote-unquote men in black tactical gear But it is quite a bit later. She was moving slow, but maybe not that slow
1297.46 1307.66 speaker3  Yeah
1305.66 1353.30 speaker2  Manstein that'd be sad
1351.42 1368.12 speaker1  11 for our Excursion into Marvin's base. I don't know how long were we there were we there for I mean
1362.64 1379.24 speaker2  Maybe and then you went to the glass compound we fought the fish men
1374.00 1422.46 speaker1  Before we fought planet juggernaut, so we don't exactly know how long we were out for either 24 hours from now hopefully unless we were knocked out for days before we
1416.48 1444.06 speaker3  Guys that just leaves true until D. Do you do you think we should go back to contention? I haven't seen him since contention and then Tildy is uh
1441.18 1467.94 speaker1  We could do drew now and then Next time we wake up in the mausoleum. It'll be later. It should be five o'clock
1465.10 1511.54 speaker3  What have you got to live for now besides saving the world It's like Douglas Adams or Shel Silverstein said flying is just
1509.54 1520.78 speaker1  16 I pass
1518.66 1541.88 speaker2  What color is it bright yellow and? You get the feeling That creature that visited you asking about the book Is nearby or will be here in a second and you need to act right now?
1538.00 1558.04 speaker1  Do you remember that thing that thing that the thing that screamed at me and it was asking for a book I think it's coming back. I think it's coming back. We got it. We got to get out of here. Let's go We might not have cars our old selves might have taken our car
1555.76 1602.44 speaker3  No, we took the car that Maggie brought us, right? Am I wrong?
1600.08 1632.00 speaker2  Cemetery you took the car that Clark came in
1627.12 1654.74 speaker3  Yeah, yeah, but then we just sat around on our asses talking about whether or not there were cars there We would I said run so I feel like we would have run for Keith and character who says run I start running towards I Think that there's still a car there. So sure. Yeah
1653.30 1925.22 speaker2  mausoleums You need to make a couple quick turns to get out in the fastest way to the parking lot that you know And as you're running you see right in front of you There's an old woman in a wheelchair and she looks at you with massive eyes and she's just like you hear this like materializing behind you and not in your way is this Massive gaunt creature wearing a black suit and it has no snow hair whatsoever On its head If you could see its knuckles, there's no hair on its knuckles You would be unaware of what its genitalia could look like Just like stuck on there that would that would be dope and you guys are running but then this thing's behind you and it cries Out what do its eyes look like? Its eyes are slits That when they open they open from the bottom instead of from the top and when they like slap down onto its cheeks You see big big eyes that are The pupils are red and the part that is white on humans is also white I She rolled a 77 oh No cars here in this parking lot 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse comes flying Across all the designated parking spots in this parking lot toward you
1918.12 1928.08 speaker3  That's gonna be a no from me dog, I rolled over my power same 79 on a 50 67 on a 60
1925.76 1957.88 speaker1  87 on a six. I rolled the 22 Fuck you
1950.76 2017.60 speaker2  You all turn around even all of John Lee Kevin Moore with all of the wheelchair just spins you around like you're standing on a Order has not been lost, but we ran into a glitch Surrounding a vector with the same genetic code as Clark Theodore Bishop But Clark Theodore Bishop does not have a twin. This is the glitch. I am here to investigate subject Clark Theodore Bishop Subject John Lee petty more the third subject Ashley Keith beans What can you tell me about this vector?
2015.60 2047.56 speaker1  That's what you did last time
2040.28 2093.44 speaker2  You hold it like you're aimed ready to fire and your finger will not pull the trigger. I Need you to roll sanity. I
2091.44 2134.90 speaker3  I look at the old lady Suspiciously, you've got to respect your elders and I'm sure she has her reasons But also have you considered that it's the weird
2132.90 2144.98 speaker2  conversation
2142.98 2160.42 speaker3  Oh
2157.50 2199.74 speaker2  However, Keith Vigna with that critical failure You're also gonna lose one sanity Cool, because you lose the maximum sanity, which is one for that
2194.54 2201.38 speaker1  You'll have to explain how what kind of hold this creature has on me because I might not be able to do it's got a hold
2199.74 2217.98 speaker2  Enough to where you won't be able to do anything So just describe what it looks like when you try to do what you want to do
2213.68 2241.90 speaker1  You see my face turn red and like sheer rage over my face It's physically hurting me from the inside out that I can't do anything
2234.78 2263.00 speaker3  But every part of him is like twitching super tense muscles and the most concerned look comes across his face And you hear him thinking this ain't right. This ain't me
2258.44 2329.78 speaker2  This thing thinks toward you and you feel release and relief in Ever that you've seen this woman because every single time you've come across her she is looked so worried So afraid almost like on the verge of death with how stressed out she is and you see her immediately come to peace and in that moment she just exhales and
2327.30 2360.68 speaker3  Frozen fingers off just because the bad circulation No, but yeah, so I Struggle with the gun for a little bit that rested from her frozen hand and and you have it
2358.26 2383.16 speaker2  Drew whips this red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse right up behind you guys and drew looks And he sees this creature looking at you and he slowly starts Driving in reverse, but just really slowly He goes about 20 yards and then he just stops and he's just watching
2379.86 2390.08 speaker3  I try to beam the thought to drew run him down
2387.64 2437.84 speaker2  Aggressions we are in time of peace This glitch is not a twin but has the same genetic makeup
2435.32 2487.92 speaker1  Is that is that what those numbers mean? We are D DC FBI does that is is that the kind of like is that
2485.92 2533.56 speaker2  table and so
2531.56 2548.24 speaker3  I thought there was more again
2546.24 2577.68 speaker1  Clark says to the fellas Myriad you you remember myriad it's that's the we saw that symbol. It's the double helices and we saw the robot man at James the mill workers house had that on his crotch and There was a ring that Keith are you do you still have that ring around my neck?
2572.08 2596.96 speaker3  Actually, I want to put it on. Can I can I move? Yes. Okay, I put it on my right ring finger
