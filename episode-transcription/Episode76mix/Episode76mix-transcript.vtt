00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
Hey, hey, hey my babies, it's episode

00:04.400 --> 00:10.240
76 and you know, that means that dr. J would be proud of all the slamming and jamming

00:10.240 --> 00:14.240
We have been doing on this here radio show as always

00:14.280 --> 00:19.520
I'm dunking on fools all day here at six nine four point two

00:19.920 --> 00:26.480
PTBP I'm grinding up fools in the post doing a dipsy do dunkaroo on their heads

00:26.480 --> 00:29.440
I'm the hoop god that you never knew

00:35.600 --> 00:37.840
Hello one hello all

00:38.580 --> 00:43.900
Hello y'all it's your best friend with a trash-eating problem wolf the dog

00:44.120 --> 00:48.760
It is December 6th, and the time is 3 o'clock y'all hmm

00:48.760 --> 00:55.080
Sounds like it's about garbage bin o'clock for you old wolfie boy now speaking of trash earlier

00:55.080 --> 01:02.420
I took my dog wolf the dog to go find him something to feel his big old belly up with but upon

01:02.520 --> 01:09.160
Venturing outside the sky suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit y'all ever seen an eclipse

01:09.160 --> 01:12.560
It was like that but uh different

01:12.560 --> 01:17.360
It was real spooky y'all wolf nearly shit his big-ass britches

01:17.480 --> 01:23.200
Which wolf did that I'll let y'all figure that one out when I came back down to the studio

01:23.200 --> 01:27.280
I found a note attached with a thumb tacked to the inside of my door

01:27.280 --> 01:32.200
It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says for wolf at the top

01:32.200 --> 01:39.000
I guess it's this week's howlin with wolf it comes from user chuckling boy over on the subreddit

01:39.000 --> 01:45.840
He's an Android user but logged into iTunes on his computer to leave a review this boy sure knows how to make old

01:46.040 --> 01:51.080
Wolfie blush and make sure y'all go and also leave us a good review

01:51.680 --> 01:57.240
Chuckling boy writes the cowboy years introduced a turn of phrase for dealing with a shitstorm

01:57.480 --> 02:02.520
We called it a night at the Opera you boys have taken care of a few off-screen

02:02.520 --> 02:06.240
But damned if your debut isn't like the Mets own debut

02:06.480 --> 02:12.720
Faust something fitting isn't that and remember the mission is over when the world ends

02:13.160 --> 02:17.480
For all of you out there listening be sure to stop by the subreddit

02:17.520 --> 02:25.440
We're starting to see more discussion around the greater delta green cannon as well as game running tips and general show stuff and whatnot

02:25.440 --> 02:31.040
And while I'm telling y'all to stop by things check out our discord and twitch

02:31.040 --> 02:36.040
You can find a link to the discord on our subreddit and some other places

02:36.040 --> 02:43.400
I think and on that twitch you can see some guy there every now and then who sounds like me

02:43.480 --> 02:45.480
but with a higher pitched voice

02:46.440 --> 02:49.200
Suspicious to keep tabs on these

02:49.840 --> 02:55.200
Suspicious happenings with those suspicious pretending pod people go to twitch.tv

02:56.000 --> 03:00.620
Slash pretending pod streams wolf bless you chuckling boy

03:00.620 --> 03:07.840

03:08.000 --> 03:15.160

03:54.480 --> 04:00.600
Whatever fuck whoever this guy is now fuck a whole lot of people but especially Jeff Bezos

04:00.600 --> 04:03.800
It's time for the news a tall gaunt

04:04.320 --> 04:06.320
humanoid figure

04:06.320 --> 04:08.320
a

04:08.960 --> 04:11.640
Older version of himself just stood

04:12.320 --> 04:14.600
None of that made a lick of sense to me

04:14.600 --> 04:22.040
But that doesn't mean I'm not hungry filling me up as always is kudzu with no

04:23.200 --> 04:25.200
back-bone

04:36.320 --> 04:38.320
Oh

04:55.640 --> 05:02.120
We're back baby, this isn't a Q&A back, baby, you're not playing animals. We've real people man

05:02.960 --> 05:04.960
Kind of we're pretending to be

05:07.320 --> 05:13.920
76 the good people. Oh, yeah, you guys are the people people like you guys are great people

05:16.160 --> 05:21.440
So I did tell you last time that we played that the next time that we played

05:22.600 --> 05:24.600
You would be back as

05:24.760 --> 05:31.280
Who you are? So I want you to get into the consciousness of your characters. John Lee Pettymore

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
Clark Bishop Keith Vigna

05:34.800 --> 05:36.120
Remember

05:36.120 --> 05:38.120
What it feels like?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.920
inside the skin of these

05:41.720 --> 05:44.080
Trash people. Oh boy. It's me clock

05:46.200 --> 05:48.800
And it's me oh, I'm I'm back baby

05:50.960 --> 05:55.040
Paul Lee Pettymore if that part makes the podcast I quit

05:56.880 --> 05:58.520
You are now

05:58.520 --> 06:05.600
John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop John John Lee Kevin Moore. Is that what you view yourself as?

06:05.600 --> 06:09.480
I feel like it's the best portmanteau to describe

06:10.560 --> 06:12.560
portmanteau

06:16.120 --> 06:18.120
The best portmanteau

06:18.320 --> 06:24.460
To describe his current situation. Yeah, also since he's made of since he's made of metal and is basically a robo cop

06:24.640 --> 06:27.080
Will you beef up my stats? Can I get cool stats?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.480
Well you cool stats, please

06:31.060 --> 06:36.120
Okay, yeah, that's fine give yourself a plus 10 to strength and

06:37.040 --> 06:44.080
Constitution and a negative 10 to dexterity and Keith Vigna do the same plus 10 to the base, right so that

06:48.760 --> 06:51.560
20 strength 20 Constitution 3 dexterity

06:52.560 --> 06:54.560
Oh

06:54.840 --> 07:01.280
Thomas when you see your character in a dream in the mirror what version is it? What does he look like?

07:01.840 --> 07:04.720
John og the fourth correct

07:05.360 --> 07:07.360
canonically the og yes from

07:08.000 --> 07:11.560
Not like the from the first episode of pretending to be people a new hope

07:13.720 --> 07:17.980
So that is the version that you all see when you see yourselves

07:18.760 --> 07:20.120
existing in

07:20.160 --> 07:27.280
An infinite darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you out of your own bodies

07:27.560 --> 07:32.920
floating in this vast nothingness you see Keith Vigna open a door and

07:33.400 --> 07:39.480
Tildy be Mitchell is there on the other side curled up in the fetal position and her body begins

07:40.440 --> 07:44.340
Deteriorating hastily like she has leprosy but in time-lapse

07:45.000 --> 07:49.320
However, she grows larger and larger with each passing moment

07:49.920 --> 07:54.560
Clark Bishop is seen handing an old piece of parchment to a young boy

07:55.000 --> 08:00.640
with a balloon shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black and

08:00.800 --> 08:08.420
immediately the boys feet catch fire and the fire grows and grows to consume the young black eyed boy and

08:08.720 --> 08:12.080
You hear three voices cry out in pain

08:13.440 --> 08:15.440
John Lee Pettymore

08:15.480 --> 08:18.320
Is crouched down crouched down

08:18.840 --> 08:24.140
He's crouched down staring at a television. That is a blank white screen

08:24.280 --> 08:27.960
He reaches out and touches the screen like Vanna White

08:27.960 --> 08:35.680
But instead of a letter popping up Clark Bishop's parents Eunice and Jerry the size of action figures

08:36.040 --> 08:40.960
Jump out of the television screen and run up John Lee Pettymore the fourth arm

08:41.660 --> 08:45.960
Climbing his shoulder and flinging themselves into John's head

08:46.920 --> 08:50.940
No, the bishops are going to disappear right into petty Moore's brain

08:51.080 --> 08:57.600
But they both get stuck halfway in their legs writhing about and flailing in this never-ending

08:58.480 --> 08:59.560
dreamscape

08:59.560 --> 09:06.040
Oily viscous sludge begins dripping and then spraying out of John Lee Pettymore the force head

09:06.160 --> 09:09.680
Where the bishops have lodged themselves and the ooze begins

09:09.880 --> 09:17.100
Collecting on a ground below now made of light and the ooze drip strips drips and then pours

09:17.480 --> 09:19.400
until a laminar flow

09:19.400 --> 09:26.600
Connects the head of John Lee Pettymore the fourth to a pool of this inky substance that begins shaping itself

09:26.800 --> 09:32.140
Into a large saucer, but as the pool grows the walls begin rising outward

09:32.620 --> 09:34.620
Creating an imposingly colossal

09:34.620 --> 09:42.100
Bowl and our view must back up leagues as this shape continues to form a mirror of what is now below

09:42.340 --> 09:46.640
the minuscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance

09:47.300 --> 09:50.500
continues to fill this thing's final form an

09:51.660 --> 09:52.820
incomprehensibly

09:52.820 --> 09:59.660
massive sphere and it continues to grow and grow and grow and

10:00.660 --> 10:02.660
Then

10:03.100 --> 10:05.100
The three of you wake up

10:05.460 --> 10:11.140
you feel like you're in shock your stomach feels weirdly full and

10:11.900 --> 10:18.900
Your ears are ringing and you feel content, but it's dark and it's cold and it smells smells like

10:19.740 --> 10:23.340
Almost sweet like like there's meat maybe

10:23.340 --> 10:25.340
Your

10:25.420 --> 10:33.180
Eyes begin to adjust and there's a pool of blood on the floor next to it is a coffin on the ground and this

10:33.380 --> 10:34.420
mausoleum

10:34.420 --> 10:36.420
And you look at each other

10:36.540 --> 10:43.180
Blood splatters speckled all over each one of you John Lee Kevin Moore and all black tactical gear

10:43.340 --> 10:47.060
Keith vigna and his brightly colored polo and boat shoes

10:47.540 --> 10:54.660
Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak

10:55.220 --> 10:56.940
and the shock

10:56.940 --> 11:00.660
Begins to wear off and you feel the searing pain you felt before

11:00.980 --> 11:06.340
on your chest on your back on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm and

11:07.180 --> 11:11.860
This time when you guys look around at each other and check each other's

11:12.700 --> 11:15.700
Skin, not only is the word Marvin crossed out

11:16.300 --> 11:22.580
But the word Maggie on each of your left feet is also crossed out. Hello again, boys

11:24.500 --> 11:31.980
Are we is this we're back we're back this is this is where we woke up last time we made it

11:33.420 --> 11:39.780
Again, how many times is this now? This would be the 30s. How many times are we gonna do this?

11:39.780 --> 11:43.160
This is the third time that we've woken up in here

11:43.200 --> 11:49.280
But this is the second time after we've died right where was Maggie written on our bodies our feet

11:49.280 --> 11:55.000
I take my shoe off because my foot is super itchy and I start scratching it and then realize that it's

11:55.320 --> 11:59.520
Exed out the only two names left her Drew and Tilly

11:59.520 --> 12:04.920
What do you guys think we did that made the Maggie get crossed off? I mean the last thing I remember is is

12:07.080 --> 12:09.640
Just piles of cash at the University

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
What

12:12.640 --> 12:17.960
Does Clark remember of like the feeling that he had before he did what he did like this

12:17.960 --> 12:22.120
He how does that feel to him thinking about that? Oh, not good. Not good at all

12:23.000 --> 12:29.940
Because basically you were under a compulsion and you had no control over your body that you now have control over but

12:30.320 --> 12:36.760
That has to make you wonder how long do you have control over your body? And how easy was it for it to be taken over?

12:36.760 --> 12:41.440
However, you guys are all back up to full hit points

12:43.040 --> 12:49.820
And your luck will start where it was last time except for we discussed luck

12:49.820 --> 12:55.620
That was awarded that was not used which is plus five for me and plus ten for Joe. I believe so

12:55.620 --> 13:00.860
Yeah, so I think I have 35. Does that sound right? It does have we ever canonically described

13:01.660 --> 13:03.660
John Lee Kevin Moore's

13:04.260 --> 13:10.820
Appearance I mean not a whole lot. I think you have full reigns in episode 76 here to

13:11.260 --> 13:13.740
Tell us what he looks like going into this arc

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
Sam Elliott and Roadhouse. Oh

13:18.740 --> 13:20.740
That's it that's I thought you were gonna

13:23.060 --> 13:28.740
Hell yeah, what a man. Oh, yeah Taylor and I watched Roadhouse like a month ago

13:28.740 --> 13:34.580
I still have never seen either one of us had ever seen it. I also watched it for the first time like last fall

13:34.620 --> 13:36.500
It's wild

13:36.500 --> 13:43.740
Was it good? It's really fucking good. It's a watch. It is extremely entertaining. So absurd. I've only ever seen bits and pieces

13:43.740 --> 13:46.300
I don't think I've ever said and watch the whole thing through an

13:46.660 --> 13:54.060
Insanely like psychotic mob boss for no reason tries to take over this small, Missouri town. Oh, it's in Missouri Patrick

13:54.060 --> 13:56.060
So, yep, Patrick Swayze

13:56.940 --> 14:04.040
Who is like a world-famous bouncer within the world's like the John wick of bouncers

14:07.700 --> 14:13.620
So he he gets a job like at a bar in the town to clean it up and he moves into

14:14.340 --> 14:16.340
this loft above

14:16.580 --> 14:21.220
Is he above the mechanic shop or on like a farm or something?

14:21.500 --> 14:28.780
Anyway for whatever reason he rents this loft that ends up being directly across this like small river from

14:29.660 --> 14:31.660
villains mansion

14:32.780 --> 14:36.580
Villains just out there like watching him while he does fucking Tai Chi in the yard and shit

14:36.580 --> 14:41.220
There's a lot of shots of him doing Tai Chi in the yard. It's great. What about our

14:41.980 --> 14:44.620
sanity so your sanity is going to

14:45.620 --> 14:46.780
Start

14:46.780 --> 14:49.820
Wherever it was when you woke up last time

14:49.980 --> 14:55.700
Which is where it was when you went into the mausoleum the first time I was afraid you were gonna say that

14:56.340 --> 15:00.980
What are you at? I'm at 19 with a breaking point of 18. I'm always like destined to

15:01.580 --> 15:03.740
Snap every time we wake up in here

15:03.740 --> 15:10.160
So I'm gonna give you 2d 20 unnatural for what you learned in the last go-around

15:10.460 --> 15:13.420
About the unnatural dope dope dope. So roll them up

15:13.940 --> 15:17.460
Luke what'd you get a 15 and a 7 ooh?

15:18.340 --> 15:20.340
22 on top of what did you have before?

15:21.100 --> 15:28.860
28 so I'm at 50. That's it's a lot maybe yeah. All right. I've done what I did. So here we are

15:29.740 --> 15:31.740
I mean I can reroll

15:32.580 --> 15:38.300
No, I like it wouldn't work. I said things and now they're they're happening Joe. What do we get?

15:38.300 --> 15:44.340
I got a 13 and a 6 that gives me 19 added on to a 30 makes it 49, right?

15:44.780 --> 15:48.300
Right there with you, bud. Oh and Thomas took his webcam off

15:48.940 --> 15:56.580
To show us his role because 17 and 11. Is that an 11 making up for last time?

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
Yeah, it's a 77

16:00.460 --> 16:04.180

16:04.820 --> 16:12.100
16 16 so coming in hot with 44 well done. So a reminder. We're all very unnatural now reminder

16:12.340 --> 16:14.740
You can use that skill at any time

16:14.740 --> 16:20.460
But if you fail on the roll, you're gonna take a 1d6 sanity check not a check a hit

16:20.820 --> 16:26.640
But you still get good stuff even from a fail. That is true. That is my favorite mechanic of the unnatural

16:27.380 --> 16:32.700
Okay, I want to peek out of the mausoleum. Do I see that old lady still?

16:33.580 --> 16:37.860
No, when you peek out you do not see the old lady there but

16:38.700 --> 16:42.940
Jumping back into the character sheet and the mechanics for one quick second

16:43.940 --> 16:50.140
Basically in Delta green and rules is written when you go on a mission and you finish the mission

16:50.420 --> 16:52.420
There are these like qualifiers

16:52.780 --> 17:00.980
that basically say like you gain this much sanity if you complete this task and so I'm gonna give you guys a

17:01.860 --> 17:03.860
D10 of sanity

17:04.420 --> 17:06.420
shit for

17:06.420 --> 17:07.660
killing

17:07.660 --> 17:12.580
Marvin glass hell, yeah, the knowledge that that entity is

17:13.420 --> 17:15.420
No longer is

17:15.860 --> 17:17.860
worth 10 sanity

17:22.780 --> 17:25.540
You got one I roll the fucking one

17:25.540 --> 17:26.980
I

17:26.980 --> 17:28.980
Need so bad

17:29.180 --> 17:30.180
Thomas

17:30.180 --> 17:37.580
The webcam and roll the 10 Wowzers live. Yeah, I got a 60 so right in the mid there

17:37.580 --> 17:42.940
So we're getting this for having killed Marvin glass. Are we is there nothing for the last arc?

17:43.740 --> 17:50.180
So that was just his first you lose whatever you just rolled. Yeah last one. Well, we killed we killed

17:50.180 --> 17:54.700
Um, well, no, he killed himself didn't he Bruce Robin like that was our

17:55.860 --> 18:00.200
Ostensibly our mission our actions caused him to die. So that should be worth

18:01.700 --> 18:09.540
So if you guys could argue that like why would killing Bruce Robin like why would that help you mentally? Oh

18:10.180 --> 18:11.860
Yeah

18:11.860 --> 18:14.500
Yeah, cuz you gave you gave us this cuz killing Marvin

18:14.940 --> 18:20.380
Felt like a way right or as maybe killing Bruce Bruce killing himself in front of you. Did that feel like a win?

18:21.500 --> 18:25.220
No, I was that didn't mean to sound like such a dick

18:30.060 --> 18:32.060
Did you guys like that

18:38.340 --> 18:44.260
Sorry, but yeah, no if nothing about that entire arc made you feel like better about the situation

18:44.500 --> 18:46.500
Then probably not

18:46.700 --> 18:48.700
Yeah

18:49.740 --> 18:51.740
But the Marvin thing was cool

18:53.460 --> 18:55.940
Hey, you got one at least better than what you had

18:56.580 --> 18:59.940
Yeah, Bruce Robin was a ruthless

19:01.460 --> 19:08.700
Capitalist who prayed on on the lower half of society to to harvest as well

19:08.700 --> 19:15.420
However, he had just recently made a pretty big statement by giving all of his employees

19:16.140 --> 19:20.820
Vacation time while he worked diligently to make all of his companies

19:21.660 --> 19:28.020
Better for the employees. So with with higher pay and some people were saying that yeah, I don't know

19:28.500 --> 19:33.660
He reminded me of my brother and I hated my brother. So him dying made me feel even better

19:33.660 --> 19:35.140
I

19:35.140 --> 19:40.220
Was just like every lost human soul makes me gain sanity

19:41.100 --> 19:45.020
Yeah, is that still a thing though? I thought we were done with all our so

19:45.540 --> 19:50.060
Yeah, we are gonna pull a clean slate on any phobias or manias

19:51.280 --> 19:58.380
Starting up into this. However, when you hit those breaking points, you will be receiving new manias and phobias and I just

19:59.380 --> 20:01.740
It's gonna happen and I don't want you to stack them

20:01.740 --> 20:08.460
So, how about that and we back and we back and we back so Keith goes and looks out the out the mausoleum

20:08.660 --> 20:13.740
And does not see the woman in the wheelchair and when you see the placement of the Sun

20:14.220 --> 20:18.460
It is later than it was last time. What's your watch say Clark?

20:18.460 --> 20:24.940
It says three three, it says 3 p.m. Which if you remember, I believe last time we woke up in here

20:25.460 --> 20:30.100
It was one I think. Yeah, Zach's holding up a one finger

20:30.500 --> 20:35.660
Yeah, it was one o'clock didn't we want to do something that I want to say for previously we thought about

20:36.260 --> 20:38.980
Hunkering down and just waiting for us to see

20:39.300 --> 20:45.940
Planet juggernaut pop out of the ground and then we would go into Marvin's lair so that we could retrieve the gun

20:46.220 --> 20:51.660
Back from him and maybe the camera also is the camera with Marvin right now, right?

20:51.660 --> 20:52.140
Yeah

20:52.140 --> 20:59.540
so I look in the direction where I think the pit is is there any kind of chaos on the city skyline from that direction when

20:59.540 --> 21:01.980
you guys walk out you walk into a

21:02.820 --> 21:06.500
Pretty chilly December 6th at 3 p.m

21:06.500 --> 21:12.380
The Sun is lower in the sky than it was the last time you're out here with these three dead men

21:13.300 --> 21:15.700
quote-unquote men in black tactical gear

21:16.420 --> 21:22.180
At your feet and a crawfish boil still going still pretty hot hot fire

21:22.780 --> 21:29.100
It hasn't gone out yet looking out you notice that there maybe should be an old woman in a wheelchair

21:29.180 --> 21:33.220
But it is quite a bit later. She was moving slow, but maybe not that slow

21:33.380 --> 21:37.460
She's had time to scoot away by now at least out of this area for sure

21:37.460 --> 21:37.780
Yeah

21:37.780 --> 21:45.260
Or it's hopefully someone's come to help her one would assume unless her family abandoned her at the funeral of Ari

21:45.660 --> 21:47.660
Manstein that'd be sad

21:49.420 --> 21:53.220
Only you have the power to decide if this world gets that sad Zach

21:55.260 --> 21:57.260
It's really not a choice

21:57.380 --> 22:02.540
It's just what happens it happens every day open your

22:04.140 --> 22:11.700
If you're not angry you're not paying attention Thomas guys what what time did we fight planet juggernaut?

22:12.400 --> 22:17.540
Okay, if we if we popped out of the mausoleum at like one o'clock well

22:17.540 --> 22:22.580
It was one o'clock the last one or the one before that it's three o'clock right now. It was one o'clock

22:23.180 --> 22:28.700
Both times previously 11 a.m.. Then 1 o'clock then 3 o'clock. Oh, I see a pattern here

22:29.380 --> 22:31.380
so if we popped out at

22:31.420 --> 22:33.300
11 for our

22:33.300 --> 22:38.140
Excursion into Marvin's base. I don't know how long were we there were we there for I mean

22:38.140 --> 22:42.640
We did quite a bit you went to Jim Cook's house, then you went to get weapons

22:42.640 --> 22:48.120
Maybe and then you went to the glass compound we fought the fish men

22:48.240 --> 22:53.480
We were knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time while we waited and there was like a waiting room

22:54.000 --> 22:59.240
Before we fought planet juggernaut, so we don't exactly know how long we were out for either

23:00.040 --> 23:05.680
So I guess the best guess is that it's like late tonight is when planet juggernaut would pop

23:05.680 --> 23:11.220
That's what I would say or early tomorrow morning even I don't know we would we would remember if it was if the Sun was

23:11.220 --> 23:15.640
Up when we popped out. Can you tell us that oh the Sun was not up so it was within

23:16.240 --> 23:20.320
24 hours from now hopefully unless we were knocked out for days before we

23:20.600 --> 23:27.560
But that would be hopefully not don't you guys know everything in this show happens like very quickly no

23:29.040 --> 23:35.640
So as I'm looking out for the old lady and scratching my foot. I realized that Maggie is exed out

23:36.480 --> 23:42.460
Guys that just leaves true until D. Do you do you think we should go back to contention?

23:42.460 --> 23:48.060
That's the last place that we know that we saw drew right anybody see him

23:48.060 --> 23:50.880
I haven't seen him since contention and then Tildy is uh

23:52.020 --> 23:55.500
Well, I think we're gonna need the gun for that one. Oh, you're right

23:55.500 --> 24:00.940
So we need to wait around until we can get our hands on that gun and camera if our luck holds out

24:01.180 --> 24:04.060
We could do drew now and then

24:04.780 --> 24:08.940
Next time we wake up in the mausoleum. It'll be later. It should be five o'clock

24:08.980 --> 24:13.100
I don't know that opens up the possibility that we'll have to kill ourselves to reset ourselves

24:13.100 --> 24:18.380
And I don't know if I want to live with that on my mind for a while if the time comes

24:18.380 --> 24:22.620
I will kill you both. There we go. What happens if we don't reset this time?

24:25.100 --> 24:27.940
What have you got to live for now besides saving the world

24:27.940 --> 24:35.060
I mean dying just isn't always like the first thing I want to do just don't die then but then we won't reset

24:35.060 --> 24:37.020
It's like Douglas

24:37.060 --> 24:41.860
Adams or Shel Silverstein said flying is just

24:47.660 --> 24:54.180
Fine is just well what Tim McGraw said all day. I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying

24:56.400 --> 25:03.240
So, let's go do it eight seconds later, I need you to roll alertness someone I got 60

25:03.240 --> 25:05.460
I got a 70 I also have 60

25:07.020 --> 25:08.060
I

25:08.060 --> 25:09.540
rolled a

25:09.540 --> 25:11.540
16 I pass

25:11.740 --> 25:17.580
out of the corner of your eye you hear a smell and it's familiar and

25:18.660 --> 25:20.780
What color is it bright yellow and?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.260
You get the feeling

25:23.260 --> 25:27.740
That creature that visited you asking about the book

25:28.660 --> 25:33.480
Is nearby or will be here in a second and you need to act right now?

25:34.360 --> 25:37.280
What do you do I tell the guy I tell the guys

25:38.000 --> 25:41.880
Do you remember that thing that thing that the thing that screamed at me and it was asking for a book

25:41.880 --> 25:44.960
I think it's coming back. I think it's coming back. We got it. We got to get out of here. Let's go

25:44.960 --> 25:48.120
Let's sprint to our car. Oh shit. Do we have cars?

25:48.120 --> 25:51.120
We might not have cars our old selves might have taken our car

25:51.120 --> 25:55.760
We took the cruiser last time I think or did we take the Accord?

25:55.760 --> 25:58.040
No, we took the car that Maggie brought us, right?

25:58.040 --> 26:03.760
So there should still be a cruiser here right or my car we can steal a car if needs be

26:03.960 --> 26:10.540
We had two cars here last time and we only took one of them. Who's got the lowest. Hold on. Let me call Enterprise

26:11.920 --> 26:13.920
Am I wrong?

26:14.000 --> 26:19.040
Yeah, there were three cars in total one that Maggie brought one that I drove there and one that you drew

26:19.040 --> 26:22.760
Yeah, and last time we all took one together Maggie went somewhere else

26:22.800 --> 26:26.320
So last time you left zero cars in the parking lot

26:26.360 --> 26:31.040
Well, how many cars are there now? That's that is to be decided when you get to the parking lot

26:31.040 --> 26:33.240
I suppose so you're saying that we took two cars

26:33.240 --> 26:40.080
I think we all took one car the first time you left the cemetery you took the cruiser and the second time you left the

26:40.080 --> 26:42.440
Cemetery you took the car that Clark came in

26:43.000 --> 26:50.280
Okay, so okay and that makes John Road with Rosemary, right? Okay, so if we go to the parking lot, what do we see?

26:50.640 --> 26:51.720
Well

26:51.720 --> 26:56.520
Were you guys all trying to decide in that moment if you should go to the parking lot?

26:56.840 --> 27:02.080
Because you didn't know whether there was a car there. Unfortunately due to our dithering. I think we I

27:02.680 --> 27:07.120
Guess we could say it was in character, but I told you guys like we needed to go so I figured we were going

27:07.120 --> 27:12.000
Yeah, yeah, but then we just sat around on our asses talking about whether or not there were cars there

27:12.000 --> 27:15.740
I feel like Joe Luke and Thomas did that. I don't know if we would have done that in character

27:15.740 --> 27:21.420
We would I said run so I feel like we would have run for Keith and character who says run I start running towards I

27:21.500 --> 27:24.020
Think that there's still a car there. So sure. Yeah

27:27.140 --> 27:31.660
As you guys are running through these tombs these above-ground

27:33.300 --> 27:34.740
mausoleums

27:34.740 --> 27:39.540
You need to make a couple quick turns to get out in the fastest way to the parking lot that you know

27:39.540 --> 27:42.460
And as you're running you see right in front of you

27:43.300 --> 27:45.300
There's an old woman in a wheelchair

27:45.780 --> 27:50.740
and she looks at you with massive eyes and she's just like

27:57.980 --> 28:01.340
And she starts crying out for help

28:07.940 --> 28:13.740
I take her with I get behind her wheelchair and start running her towards the parking lot. You gotta come with us, ma'am

28:13.900 --> 28:20.900
We'll get you out of here amazing and right behind you as you guys are nearing the turn for the parking lot

28:21.260 --> 28:23.260
you hear this like

28:27.060 --> 28:30.380
And if you look back while you're running you see that

28:31.020 --> 28:34.860
materializing behind you and not in your way is this

28:35.500 --> 28:41.660
Massive gaunt creature wearing a black suit and it has no snow hair whatsoever

28:41.980 --> 28:43.980
On its head

28:44.100 --> 28:47.480
If you could see its knuckles, there's no hair on its knuckles

28:48.260 --> 28:53.860
Certainly, no eyebrows. How about down there any down there? You can't see the down there, but you

28:54.420 --> 29:00.180
Looking at the rest of this from the rest of it might assume that it is both hairless and that

29:00.860 --> 29:04.980
You would be unaware of what its genitalia could look like

29:06.020 --> 29:07.260
Kendall

29:07.260 --> 29:10.580
It could be anything. I mean it's got a Ken doll down there

29:12.660 --> 29:19.980
Like just the smooth taint. Oh, I thought you meant like it's smooth, but there's a kindle attached to the front

29:24.100 --> 29:30.820
Just like stuck on there that would that would be dope and you guys are running but then this thing's behind you and it cries

29:30.820 --> 29:32.820
Out what do its eyes look like?

29:35.940 --> 29:38.260
Its eyes are slits

29:38.900 --> 29:43.180
That when they open they open from the bottom instead of from the top and

29:44.060 --> 29:47.700
when they like slap down onto its cheeks

29:48.780 --> 29:51.980
You see big big eyes that are

29:52.500 --> 29:59.260
The pupils are red and the part that is white on humans is also white

29:59.260 --> 30:01.260
I

30:06.340 --> 30:13.140
Hand the old lady my gun and I'm like you ever used one of these boy howdy she's gonna roll sanity

30:17.920 --> 30:19.920
She rolled a 77 oh

30:20.900 --> 30:27.880
Hell yes. Oh, that's bad properly. No, this old lady's got it together. She she has 85 sanity

30:27.920 --> 30:33.120
Oh sweet, so it's a critical success. So she cocks the gun. Yeah. Oh

30:34.680 --> 30:38.360
Interesting, so she cut I was using these before you were born

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
She's instantly on board with this

30:44.760 --> 30:49.520
Justin come on in we just got our new tank ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, let's call it

30:49.520 --> 30:51.600
Hey tell Justin get in here and play an old lady

30:51.880 --> 30:53.880
She

30:54.800 --> 31:00.680
Cocks the gun immediately and I just wanted to provide cover fire over our shoulders

31:02.400 --> 31:07.920
And when you make it out into the parking lot you see that there are

31:08.560 --> 31:11.960
No cars here in this parking lot

31:14.200 --> 31:16.200
Until a red

31:16.640 --> 31:20.000
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse comes flying

31:20.640 --> 31:26.360
Across all the designated parking spots in this parking lot toward you

31:27.720 --> 31:33.600
Who's in it? Is it baby driver and behind the wheel you can see drew Andrews

31:43.080 --> 31:45.080
Now

31:45.080 --> 31:48.360
Unfortunately, I've never been so excited. I need you all the real power

31:54.620 --> 31:56.620
Shit

31:58.120 --> 32:05.220
That's gonna be a no from me dog, I rolled over my power same 79 on a 50 67 on a 60

32:05.760 --> 32:08.080
87 on a six. I rolled the 22

32:09.040 --> 32:11.040
Fuck you

32:11.920 --> 32:16.280
Unless that's good then. Hell yeah drew had an 11 sanity. So he also critically feels

32:17.640 --> 32:24.920
You all here. Hello subject Clark Theodore Bishop and you all

32:28.480 --> 32:30.480
Freeze

32:30.760 --> 32:37.880
You all turn around even all of John Lee Kevin Moore with all of the wheelchair just spins you around like you're standing on a

32:38.000 --> 32:43.200
Platform I am here to offer apologies and to put your minds to rest

32:44.240 --> 32:48.360
Order has not been lost, but we ran into a glitch

32:49.160 --> 32:54.200
Surrounding a vector with the same genetic code as Clark Theodore Bishop

32:54.360 --> 33:00.680
But Clark Theodore Bishop does not have a twin. This is the glitch. I am here to

33:01.360 --> 33:02.320
investigate

33:02.320 --> 33:04.320
subject Clark Theodore Bishop

33:04.800 --> 33:09.600
Subject John Lee petty more the third subject Ashley Keith beans

33:10.400 --> 33:13.400
What can you tell me about this vector?

33:17.480 --> 33:24.520
Your name is Ashley my face gets super red I'm like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about

33:24.520 --> 33:26.520
Oh

33:28.400 --> 33:35.600
That's something I shoot I shoot at him I get super mad super flustered and I shoot at him that's in line

33:35.600 --> 33:37.600
That's what you did last time

33:38.280 --> 33:44.440
All right, yeah, I go ahead and roll power again because you'll have to win a contest of power

33:47.480 --> 33:52.840
Fucking hell dude, what'd you get? I'm rolling rocks. I rolled a 33 Oh

33:54.520 --> 33:59.880
I got an eight. I'm sorry Keith Vigna as you pull the gun out

34:00.280 --> 34:07.560
You hold it like you're aimed ready to fire and your finger will not pull the trigger. I

34:08.240 --> 34:10.240
Need you to roll sanity. I

34:12.600 --> 34:14.600
Got a 99

34:14.600 --> 34:16.600
Oh

34:20.560 --> 34:27.960
So, yeah days over my power, yes, I believe it is oh dang it looks like I wasn't recording I guess we got to start

34:31.120 --> 34:33.120
Dang

34:34.560 --> 34:36.560
Restart checkpoint

34:36.840 --> 34:41.840
You guys all just pull guns on each other. See come back at five. Thanks

34:44.600 --> 34:50.880
Thanks for clueing us into our strategy my finger won't move when I try to fire it and I look at

34:51.440 --> 34:53.440
I look at the old lady

34:54.280 --> 34:56.280
Why are you doing this to me?

35:02.560 --> 35:07.760
She won't let me shoot him and I look panicked at my two friends, but also

35:08.400 --> 35:12.980
Suspiciously, you've got to respect your elders and I'm sure she has her reasons

35:13.020 --> 35:15.400
But also have you considered that it's the weird

35:16.540 --> 35:23.740
Future man doing it. Yeah, I'm with John on this one Keith. I think that it's the tall guy over there. That's making us

35:23.740 --> 35:25.380
Maybe you don't want me to shoot him

35:25.380 --> 35:32.600
I mean I that's also true at this moment you realize that none of your mouths have been moving and you've been having this

35:32.900 --> 35:34.900
conversation

35:34.900 --> 35:36.900
Mentally, I

35:37.300 --> 35:41.300
Need you guys to roll. I'm sorry tall guy. Did you just hear all that?

35:42.980 --> 35:44.980
Oh

35:46.740 --> 35:48.740
94

35:48.780 --> 35:56.580
97 oh boy. What are we rolling? I need Joe and Thomas Clark and John both lose one sanity

35:57.500 --> 36:00.420
However, Keith Vigna with that critical failure

36:01.140 --> 36:03.220
You're also gonna lose one sanity

36:03.740 --> 36:09.020
Cool, because you lose the maximum sanity, which is one for that

36:09.020 --> 36:15.940
Well, okay, so I had that buffer of one so I don't break right now. Oh nice

36:18.900 --> 36:26.620
Yeah, and hold on for just one scene longer and as you guys realize that you were having this conversation mentally oh wait

36:27.900 --> 36:32.180
That was a sanity roll and I rolled over my yes, you did same

36:32.180 --> 36:34.540
I don't know if okay

36:34.540 --> 36:39.740
You'll have to explain how what kind of hold this creature has on me because I might not be able to do it's got a hold

36:39.740 --> 36:41.380
Enough to where you won't be able to do anything

36:41.380 --> 36:44.840
So just describe what it looks like when you try to do what you want to do

36:44.840 --> 36:48.780
But you can't do what you want to do. I feel like this happened before

36:49.780 --> 36:53.680
Discribed it as yeah, I just kind of boil from the inside

36:53.680 --> 36:57.980
You see my face turn red and like sheer rage over my face

36:57.980 --> 37:01.940
It's physically hurting me from the inside out that I can't do anything

37:02.180 --> 37:07.980
Meanwhile Kevin is freaking out picks his can he move his body just like minutely

37:09.780 --> 37:12.200
Well, then you can tell that if he could move his body

37:13.100 --> 37:14.780
He would be freaking out

37:14.780 --> 37:21.900
But every part of him is like twitching super tense muscles and the most concerned look comes across his face

37:23.020 --> 37:27.560
And you hear him thinking this ain't right. This ain't me

37:27.560 --> 37:32.160
This ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son. It ain't me

37:33.800 --> 37:37.920
As you're all essentially just like in suspended motion

37:38.440 --> 37:43.000
This thing thinks toward you and you feel

37:44.160 --> 37:46.600
release and relief in

37:47.600 --> 37:54.240
Your bones you can feel it reverberate. Do not do not be afraid

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
Do not be afraid

37:57.560 --> 38:01.240
Hey, hey, I'm not a family on the shore

38:02.920 --> 38:10.680
I'm giving you relief here. Welcome to fucking welcome to fucking welcome to the fucking show kids

38:12.560 --> 38:16.960
And as you're all calm you see this woman for the first time maybe

38:17.680 --> 38:23.180
Ever that you've seen this woman because every single time you've come across her she is looked so worried

38:23.300 --> 38:29.500
So afraid almost like on the verge of death with how stressed out she is and you see her

38:30.460 --> 38:32.620
immediately come to peace and

38:33.220 --> 38:35.140
in that moment

38:35.140 --> 38:38.140
she just exhales and

38:38.900 --> 38:45.060
Freezes I try to take the gun from her hand. Her hand is kind of stuck to it a little bit. I

38:45.700 --> 38:47.300
pry her

38:47.300 --> 38:49.780
Frozen fingers off just because the bad circulation

38:49.780 --> 38:51.780
I

38:53.300 --> 38:55.300
Snap

38:58.460 --> 39:00.580
No, but yeah, so I

39:00.580 --> 39:05.260
Struggle with the gun for a little bit that rested from her frozen hand and and you have it

39:05.260 --> 39:11.100
I don't know why you would need a gun in your hand with how relaxed and chill you are right now as this thing's

39:11.100 --> 39:17.540
Like what? Can you tell me about this vector and you hear a screech behind you as

39:18.260 --> 39:20.680
Drew whips this red

39:21.620 --> 39:26.380
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse right up behind you guys and drew looks

39:27.020 --> 39:31.820
And he sees this creature looking at you and he slowly starts

39:32.700 --> 39:35.060
Driving in reverse, but just really slowly

39:35.300 --> 39:39.860
He goes about 20 yards and then he just stops and he's just watching

39:39.860 --> 39:43.160
I try to beam the thought to drew run him down

39:43.680 --> 39:47.000
Run them over you need not have those

39:47.640 --> 39:50.080
Aggressions we are in time of peace

39:50.080 --> 39:57.200
I will tell you what will help you if you will help me Clark's ears perk up at that for sure

39:57.280 --> 40:00.520
What what do you need and what can you offer?

40:00.520 --> 40:07.420
I am looking for information about a glitch in regards to subject Clark Theodore Bishop

40:07.420 --> 40:11.720
This glitch is not a twin but has the same genetic makeup

40:11.760 --> 40:16.360
I can't help but notice that you've abandoned the numbers format that you were using last time

40:16.360 --> 40:21.800
We saw you are you are you the same thing that we saw last time? I am four three six two nine

40:21.800 --> 40:26.200
I wanted to make sure that you are more comfortable

40:26.880 --> 40:28.880
DC FBI is what it was

40:29.680 --> 40:35.320
I've been I've been through some stuff. I know those numbers now you does that does that mean your DC FBI?

40:35.320 --> 40:37.840
Is that is that what those numbers mean? We are

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
We are I thought you were going to continue

40:48.520 --> 40:50.520
We are blah blah blah blah

40:52.680 --> 40:58.340
D DC FBI does that is is that the kind of like is that

40:58.960 --> 41:05.480
District of Columbia Federal Bureau of Investigation. Is that what that stands for? So here's a thing

41:05.480 --> 41:07.520
I need you all the real power

41:12.320 --> 41:14.320
Three

41:14.920 --> 41:20.200
Ooh a 25 I pass I got a 40 on a 50. Holy shit. We all passed

41:20.680 --> 41:25.040
God, okay. Yeah, and I failed. Yeah, look how the

41:25.920 --> 41:27.920
table and so

41:28.080 --> 41:30.360
That will be important here in a second

41:31.000 --> 41:36.200
District of Columbia your nation's capital. What's up with your voice?

41:36.360 --> 41:40.040
This is the voice that I have to communicate with

41:40.640 --> 41:44.960
What a different voice make you more comfortable. I guess

41:45.680 --> 41:53.800
Physically, what are you? I am NOT like you that is apparent and you know that I'm not trying to other eyes you in any

41:53.800 --> 42:00.440
Way, but are you like a future man, or are you some kind of space creature? I am simply better

42:01.280 --> 42:09.200
That's an opinion it is not it is fact I am here to begin. Oh

42:11.560 --> 42:13.560
I thought there was more again

42:14.800 --> 42:22.080
Again begin what we are myriad and we are here to advance. Oh

42:23.640 --> 42:25.640
You stuff in there again. Okay. Gotcha

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
Clark says to the fellas

42:28.840 --> 42:35.400
Myriad you you remember myriad it's that's the we saw that symbol. It's the double helices and we saw the

42:36.560 --> 42:40.600
robot man at James the mill workers house had that on his crotch and

42:41.400 --> 42:46.040
There was a ring that Keith are you do you still have that ring around my neck?

42:46.040 --> 42:52.080
I have the ring on a my shoestring show him that ring. I guess yeah, I hold it up

42:52.080 --> 42:57.680
Actually, I want to put it on. Can I can I move? Yes. Okay, I put it on my right ring finger

42:58.240 --> 43:02.680
And hold it out to him. We are a myriad as well

43:02.680 --> 43:08.560
And this thing looks at you and holds out its hand toward you subject Jim

43:08.720 --> 43:12.280
James cook you are not you are

43:12.800 --> 43:16.960
Subject Ashley Keith beans. What is you do? Why?

43:24.520 --> 43:27.880
Hello subject Ashley Keith beans

43:28.400 --> 43:30.400
Why do you have this?

43:31.600 --> 43:33.600
Ring

43:33.840 --> 43:36.720
I've always had it roll power

43:40.520 --> 43:42.520
25 on a 50

43:43.960 --> 43:51.640
Failed you have always had it for a while. Obviously, that's just Jim cook in the body of Keith beans

43:52.320 --> 43:57.480
Yeah subject Jim James cook you are still alive. This is excellent news

43:59.240 --> 44:01.240
I

44:03.520 --> 44:10.280
Whisper in Keith's ear. Why don't you tell him that we're your friends and you need him to restate your primary mission

44:10.640 --> 44:18.000
To brief us on what's going on. I look at the thing. Did you catch that? I am sorry what he said

44:18.320 --> 44:20.320
can you I

44:21.320 --> 44:26.280
Need you to restate my mission to make sure that you're who you say you are

44:28.240 --> 44:30.240
I

44:35.360 --> 44:37.360
Bubble gum tree

44:40.200 --> 44:42.200
Does that work

44:43.480 --> 44:48.080
Subject Jim James cook before your death you were working on

44:48.800 --> 44:51.540
operation stapler Android program

44:51.900 --> 44:58.500
Respect to cut down on cost and sell to private companies like the city asylum

44:58.500 --> 45:05.380
Are you still working on this? I approach the creature and get really close to it

45:05.380 --> 45:07.820
I don't know if these guys

45:08.580 --> 45:10.580
Know about that yet. So

45:11.180 --> 45:13.180
But yeah

45:15.260 --> 45:20.260
Then why did you ask me to state your brief loudly

45:21.660 --> 45:25.480
I didn't say loudly. I only talk in one volume

45:26.540 --> 45:30.580
Well, as long as they can know we're good to go. They're they're helping me out here

45:30.580 --> 45:35.740
I assumed when you asked that they were not our enemy. Yeah, I'm still working on it

45:35.860 --> 45:40.780
Just to make sure I can trust you. What is project stapler again?

45:41.860 --> 45:44.140
Well, I just told you just told us

45:44.660 --> 45:51.340
It was a merely operation to cut costs on Android creations and sell them to companies

45:51.620 --> 45:53.620
including the contention orphanage

45:54.340 --> 45:55.860
asylum

45:55.860 --> 46:02.220
Contention asylum which one city asylum the city asylum. Hey Keith. I'm I mean a

46:02.900 --> 46:09.460
Jim will you ask this thing if it's a robot? Is this a robot? You're not a robot

46:09.460 --> 46:13.100
Are you I am NOT a robot, but you're an Android

46:13.100 --> 46:18.240
Why would you assume that I am either robot or Android I am neither

46:18.440 --> 46:24.360
So you're an alien I am from where I am from which is I do not know

46:24.360 --> 46:28.160
So, how do you know you're neither robot nor Android nor alien? I am

46:29.120 --> 46:31.120
alone

46:32.380 --> 46:37.400
Technically in your definitions an alien, that's awesome, man

46:38.080 --> 46:42.400
That's really cool. Well, so yeah, Jim Jim's just plugging away there

46:43.040 --> 46:45.960
At that at that project stapler

46:45.960 --> 46:50.120
Yeah, I ran into a little bit of a mix-up with my old body in this one

46:50.120 --> 46:52.700
But uh, tell me more about the vector

46:52.760 --> 46:59.040
We are on the same team and you are working with subject Clark Theodore Bishop

46:59.040 --> 47:05.580
Please tell me more about the vector. What do you want to know? It just seems to be a little time-traveling thing

47:05.620 --> 47:07.620
Yes. Yeah, nothing too big

47:07.780 --> 47:13.700
Hey, maybe we'll tell you a little bit more about the vector if you can tell us about operation three ring binder and

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
hole puncher and hole puncher

47:23.540 --> 47:27.800
Little whisper thing that he does every now and then does that sound like speech it sounds like yeah

47:27.800 --> 47:31.320
He's communicating with some sort of speech some sort of uplink

47:31.420 --> 47:36.500
Okay, when I showed him the ring did it like glow or do anything? No, I

47:37.060 --> 47:43.220
Am unfamiliar with operation hole puncher or operation three ring binder

47:43.220 --> 47:46.860
And I he meant that or is he know and that yeah, can I he meant it as well?

47:46.860 --> 47:49.420
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and roll him it

47:50.340 --> 47:54.060
Fail 76 on a 50. I got a 75 on a 80

47:54.940 --> 47:59.660
75 on an 80 would tell you you are not exactly

48:00.700 --> 48:02.300
familiar with

48:02.300 --> 48:04.300
non-human intelligence, however

48:05.300 --> 48:07.100
If you were guessing

48:07.100 --> 48:10.660
You would say that it didn't talk differently

48:10.660 --> 48:14.420
So it's either been lying the whole time or telling the truth the whole time

48:14.860 --> 48:18.740
Probably sounds like a real straight shooter Clark is gonna address the creature

48:18.740 --> 48:23.940
Can you can you tell us how you how you and Jim are related? What how do you guys know each other?

48:23.940 --> 48:29.480
Jim here works for myriad. How long has he been doing that? How long has he been with myriad?

48:29.480 --> 48:34.840
Why do you do not know things about him he is right here

48:34.840 --> 48:41.440
I'm Jim is just a real hard guy to get to open up and we've been working with him for a while and we you know

48:41.880 --> 48:48.640
One of subject Jim James Cook's best qualities is his inability to open up. So you understand

48:48.640 --> 48:52.360
so we just you know, we we really come to appreciate the feller and

48:53.240 --> 48:57.800
Well, we just want to know a little bit more about him. So maybe on his birthday we can do something special

48:58.460 --> 49:03.160
You know with with a personal touch what have you done on his previous birthdays?

49:03.160 --> 49:06.760
Well, he hasn't told us when it is so we'd like to do something at all

49:15.360 --> 49:22.960
Jim cook I gotta make that shorter some I'll speed it up in post just replace it with modem sounds

49:22.960 --> 49:24.960
Hahahaha

49:26.080 --> 49:30.000
Subject Jim James Cook does the same thing on his birthday

49:30.800 --> 49:34.960
Every birthday for the past decade on his birthday

49:35.800 --> 49:42.920
December 1st, he always goes to his favorite pie shop in the city called

49:44.800 --> 49:46.800
Prairie pie, but it's like

49:47.760 --> 49:49.760
Prairie pie. Yes

49:49.760 --> 49:51.760
And

49:52.160 --> 50:00.560
It's yeah, it's two folded hands on the outside in a triangle making that's like a pie slice

50:05.480 --> 50:11.320
We have a local pie maker in Springfield called Prairie pie like on the Prairie like home and

50:12.040 --> 50:18.720
It's the best pie. Anyway, I have a piece of the honey sea salt in my fridge right now every December 1st

50:19.160 --> 50:21.560
Subject Jim James Cook's birthday

50:21.560 --> 50:27.240
He goes to Prairie pie in the city before walking back home

50:27.240 --> 50:31.240
I walk back home to contention. No Jim lives in the city

50:31.240 --> 50:32.160
Oh, yeah

50:32.160 --> 50:39.640
What do you know in exchange for this information to make subject Jim James Cook's birthday better now?

50:39.640 --> 50:43.000
We know to get him pie. What do you know about the vector? Oh

50:43.520 --> 50:49.840
Nothing really during my mishap when I had to switch bodies I a lot of info got kind of a

50:50.600 --> 50:54.840
Jar-bolt around my head. I there's some things I just don't remember

50:55.360 --> 50:57.280
Subject Jim James Cook

50:57.280 --> 51:05.320
Are you in the body of subject Ashley Keith beans in order to repair the relationship regarding?

51:05.880 --> 51:07.880
operation San Ferra blum

51:08.920 --> 51:10.920
Yes

51:11.800 --> 51:13.800
Precisely

51:15.320 --> 51:17.320
Clark nudges Keith

51:18.000 --> 51:23.640
Like I don't I can't do it without him hearing so I just nudge you after you say just yes

51:23.640 --> 51:30.200
And you stop talking. I nudge you well, how do you suggest we move forward Jim?

51:30.200 --> 51:34.840
You don't you don't remember very much about that mission. Do you you should have him remind you what it is? Yeah

51:35.240 --> 51:38.640
Yeah, no, I mean Jim obviously remembers it pretty well

51:38.640 --> 51:43.640
But what he did say is before he made a move he wanted to consult with us tactically

51:44.240 --> 51:48.320
But yeah, you did want you to fill us in on that right? Yeah that way they know

51:48.840 --> 51:56.360
So we yeah really if subject just James is taken care of I suppose

51:56.400 --> 52:00.660
We can move forward in what way sorry we're playing catch-up

52:00.660 --> 52:06.640
Will you describe who subject just James is to us? I mean out of character. Do you know yeah?

52:07.000 --> 52:13.320
It's James the mill worker that's why we've called him James the mill worker forever cuz he's just James I am curious

52:13.480 --> 52:16.440
I will give you information about

52:17.120 --> 52:23.580
Operation San Ferra blum if you will first give me information about the vector

52:23.840 --> 52:29.520
Clark Clark's gonna step forward toward it. Do you do you know you called it a glitch earlier?

52:29.520 --> 52:33.200
Do you would you have a running theory on what this new vector is?

52:33.920 --> 52:38.440
I'm gonna be straight with you a scary man that we don't exactly know for sure

52:39.440 --> 52:44.880
We've got our own theories. Do you have a theory our working theory is a clone?

52:45.480 --> 52:51.280
Yeah, I mean I guess that the clones old though, so wouldn't this one be the clone we've seen

52:51.280 --> 52:55.320
We've seen this vector that I believe you're speaking of and it looks like me

52:55.520 --> 53:00.600
But it seems like an older version of me is it helping or hurting I?

53:01.480 --> 53:09.200
Like to think it's helping it seems it seems helpful so far seems more healthy than hurting does it seem to have an agenda

53:09.960 --> 53:11.240
Yeah

53:11.240 --> 53:18.460
Yes, yes, it does. What is this agenda? It's cryptic to say the to say the least yeah that remains unclear

53:18.880 --> 53:25.160
Where was this vector seen last from your perspective? I point behind it

53:25.160 --> 53:27.460
Yeah, I point at the mausoleum. It was

53:27.460 --> 53:29.900
You get he I was in there

53:29.900 --> 53:33.580
Oh, we're calling him Clark old Clark old was in in there

53:33.580 --> 53:37.760
And then and then he wasn't he he doesn't he disappeared on us. What time?

53:38.340 --> 53:42.940
11 or that's when we woke up so like 9 or 10, maybe yeah, thank you

53:42.940 --> 53:46.660
I have decided many things during our

53:47.460 --> 53:49.020
conversation one

53:49.020 --> 53:55.440
Subject Ashley Keith beans you are not subject Jim James cook number two

53:55.720 --> 54:02.340
Just wait a minute there you all are clearly working in a way that you do not understand

54:02.920 --> 54:06.860
What your causalities are creating in this time?

54:06.860 --> 54:11.960
I need for this reason too, and I am sorry wipe your memories

54:14.120 --> 54:19.760
And it reaches out its hand I pull my gun out and try to shoot it so here

54:19.760 --> 54:25.060
Let's think about what happens this thing reaches out its arm as Keith Vigna pulls out his gun

54:26.160 --> 54:28.680
you see it like struggling as

54:29.160 --> 54:31.480
We rolled the power check earlier

54:31.480 --> 54:37.440
And you all succeeded it thinks that it succeeded and leaves it has

54:37.920 --> 54:41.040
Completed its task and it disappears out of existence

54:41.680 --> 54:49.200
But you all remember everything tight holy shit, and it went in a way different way than I expected it to

54:49.200 --> 54:57.480
Yeah, we pumped that alien all his information and as you guys turn around and I'm singing like a canary

54:58.680 --> 55:03.600
Let's go kill Tildy does Sam Farah bloom mean anything to you guys I?

55:04.720 --> 55:07.520
Don't think it. No. I don't have no idea

55:08.400 --> 55:12.540
If I google it does anything come up go ahead and roll computer

55:15.240 --> 55:17.040
87 on a 20

55:17.040 --> 55:21.500
No when you google Sam Farah bomb nothing comes up. I spell it wrong

55:23.520 --> 55:25.520
I'd like to try as well

55:27.520 --> 55:29.520
Fuck 60 other

55:29.520 --> 55:36.200
Clark doesn't have any computer skill zero percent zero percent that makes sense yep. That was my design

55:38.280 --> 55:43.380
Clark only uses his phone to text and just barely gets through it

55:43.740 --> 55:44.860
You

55:44.860 --> 55:49.460
Hear the car pull up right behind you it scares me, so I aim my gun at Drew

55:50.300 --> 55:54.420
For just a second until I realize who it is Clark tries to like no no no

55:54.740 --> 55:59.060
Throw a hand onto the gun to put it down to the ground. No. It's it's Keith. It's true. It's true

55:59.060 --> 56:04.180
Look, it's true is the old lady still here in the wheelchair. There is a woman's body

56:04.540 --> 56:08.420
Is it alive body? Why why did you say that Zach?

56:09.780 --> 56:11.780
Is it is she dead?

56:12.780 --> 56:14.500
When she

56:14.500 --> 56:15.720
finally

56:15.720 --> 56:22.340
Finally for the first time in over a decade had no pain and no fear in her heart and in her mind

56:23.100 --> 56:25.100
She felt ready to go

56:26.460 --> 56:32.300
Did she die fuck we killed her December 6 we have no way of knowing that so we're

56:34.980 --> 56:38.660
Holy shit that that alien must have scared her death

56:39.660 --> 56:46.820
Oh, maybe he did something terrible to her mind drew pulls up in the 2001 red Mitsubishi Eclipse

56:47.140 --> 56:48.980
rolls down the window

56:48.980 --> 56:55.860
Hello contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me. Oh boy. It is good to see you drew

56:55.860 --> 57:01.240
What's contention like true? I'm so happy you're still around we were calling you

57:01.740 --> 57:06.100
We weren't the fastest were calling you earlier, but not now

57:06.100 --> 57:09.100
Good to see you drew

57:36.100 --> 57:38.100
Oh

58:06.100 --> 58:08.100
You
