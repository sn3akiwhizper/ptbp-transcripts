1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome, my slimy babies, to the greasiest radio show ever howled out of jowls.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,500
It's your big-time, crime-loving, slime-daddy wolf, the dog.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:22,000
I like to cover myself in my own saliva constantly to protect myself from the powers of other dimensional beings.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,300
And cause I think it smells just right,

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:42,800
I am slipping and sliding at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the slimiest, grimiest, bad-rimeiest radio station this side of the Great Atlantic Salt Lake.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Did y'all know that there's a thing this old wolfie would love for you to do right now?

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,300
Well, there is. Write a five-star review of this show on Apple Podcasts.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,300
Ah, are you on a computer or an an-deroid?

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,800
Before you boo-hoo, look around you. Someone is using an iPhone.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Ask if you can review the show on their phone, if they ask why I tell them.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:16,300
And maybe I'll read your review, like I'm about to read this one here from D-Town Pods entitled, only about halfway through.

12
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,300
D-Town Pods writes,

13
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,800
The only phone I know how to operate is the old-timey rotary ones.

14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
I like sticking my finger in them and never pulling out.

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,300
Hard to reach folks that way, though.

16
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,800
I just rely on the way that my voice can penetrate all dimensions and times.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Can't everyone do that, too?

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
But, uh, thanks for the compliment, D-Town.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,800
But I'd appreciate it if more of these reviews talked a little bit more about little old me.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,300
I'm starting to feel unloved.

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Well, there's time for love-making.

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Then there's time for news-making.

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
It is the news right now.

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Last time, Pastor Adam Kane showed up on the four-wheeler with the radio and Agent Trent Chad in the body of Salem the Cat.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,300
Fucking sick, am I right?

26
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:46,800
Also, Casey Kristoff was, and still is, holding Carrie Page's hostage with a pistol aimed at the back of her head.

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,300
She hollered out,

28
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Bubblegum tree to the boys, confirming their identity as the beautiful soul of Drew Andrews.

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Unfortunately for these boys, though, Keith Vigna tripped and slid face-first down into the muddy basin that was once Bean's Pond.

30
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,800
Though he did pop up in time to shatter one of the glass tubes on the odd-looking radio.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:20,300
However, that was the last move taken before Pastor Adam Kane smashed a residue-filled fish onto his strange helmet.

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,300
Greenlighting the greenlight and sending the three PCs into a reality of their deepest regrets.

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:36,300
When they came to, Agent Trent Cat had disarmed John Lee Pettymore, Clark Bishop was about to trip into the mud bowl,

34
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:44,300
and Keith Vigna was being dragged by Daddy Kane toward the impassable metal plate, which began to slide open.

35
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:52,300
I swear to me, we better find out what's behind this fucking door before I premiere next week's brand new track,

36
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,300
which most assuredly will not be Kudzu With No Backbone.

37
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Luke's internet sucks, the world sucks, the world's always sucks, but what doesn't sucks, what doesn't sucks is hanging out with my friends and playing like we're other people.

38
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,300
It doesn't sucks.

39
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
It's nice, actually.

40
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Let's get right into it. Clark Bishop, it's your turn, what do you do?

41
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,300
Hold on, let me, uh, can I share my screen real quick?

42
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Jesus fucking Christ.

43
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,300
That is not what I expected to happen.

44
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,300
But it should have been.

45
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,300
Do you have the ability to? I guess is a question I should ask. Have I given you the ability to?

46
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Host disabled participant screen sharing.

47
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Oh, actually Joe Terry is the host, because I love Joe Terry.

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Oh, right.

49
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,300
So we ain't gonna see shit.

50
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Alright, Clark Bishop, it's your turn, what do you do?

51
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
That's really not that important, so.

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
We didn't think it was.

53
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:29,300
No shit.

54
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,300
I know you were excited to see what it was and probably learn something, but.

55
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,300
I think, I think it's open now.

56
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Okay, good.

57
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,300
I swear to God, if it's a top list, if it's a top ten list from classicrock.com.

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Nope, it's just lots of this.

59
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Is it normal to pee and poop at the same time?

60
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,300
It's so much worse than I-

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Well, no, what he Googled was poopy.

62
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,300
No, I Googled pee and poop at the same time.

63
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Oh, okay, gotcha.

64
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Pee and poop at the same time.

65
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Yeah.

66
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Is what we're getting here.

67
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Hey, you have four messages in your Reddit inbox, why don't you go look at those?

68
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,300
It's all like trending on.

69
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Why don't you look at those right now?

70
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
This is very slow.

71
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Yeah, we might be tempting fate by having you loaded.

72
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Yeah, let's just get back to it.

73
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
It's so true, why are we doing this?

74
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Oh, yeah.

75
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Yeah.

76
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Loop's internet has been crabbing out for the past, what, hour and 45 minutes while

77
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
we've been trying to record?

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
Yeah.

79
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Yeah, like three months.

80
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Oh, guys.

81
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
Yeah, yeah, ever since.

82
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Forever.

83
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Oh, boy.

84
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Okay.

85
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,300
More fun than this was recording in person and hanging out with friends.

86
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Dude, I wish we could do that.

87
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
All right, Clark Bishop, it is your turn.

88
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
What do you do?

89
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Do you remember what happened to me last time?

90
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Of course I do.

91
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
I was running the game.

92
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,300
You came back to reality and you were looking across this.

93
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Oh, there goes gravity.

94
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Oh, there goes gravity.

95
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,300
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy is what Casey Kristoff seems to be saying

96
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
with the gun that's still pointed in the back of Perry Page's head.

97
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,300
There's spaghetti nowhere, as far as you can tell, but the muddy basin that was Bean's

98
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Pond does kind of look like a spaghetti bowl that has been finished, but the sauce is still

99
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,300
kind of hanging out in the bottom of the bowl as it is filled with a liquid soil.

100
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
So.

101
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Mud.

102
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Did we get there?

103
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,300
And then also, Agent Shrink Cat is on the ground next to John Lee Pettymore the Thirth

104
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,300
with the gun that John was just holding and the clip is like out the magazine.

105
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Did I roll to contest that?

106
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Trying to get it out.

107
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Well, no.

108
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
See, you weren't in this reality for two rounds.

109
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,300
In the first round, the cat made it up the hill and then the second round rolled an ought

110
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
one.

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Smart move, cat.

112
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Yeah.

113
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
That was that ought one was for last time.

114
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,300
You should stop using your one dice.

115
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
It's true.

116
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
It hardly seems fair.

117
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
It's just a ping pong ball with the one written on it.

118
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
This is it.

119
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh, and also, Keith Bigna is being dragged in a half nelson toward the impassable metal

120
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,300
plate on the ground in the middle of this muddy basin and that metal plate, aka the

121
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,300
door at Bean's Pond that you've been making your way toward, basically, this entire arc,

122
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,300
is opening as he approaches.

123
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,300
I was mostly getting at during my secret time, I rolled over my power, so I had to physically

124
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
move to go do something.

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Did I end up somewhere different in this world?

126
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Oh, yeah, that's fun.

127
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Roll a dexterity check right off the bat.

128
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,300
You're still going to have to act out what you were doing there, but if you fail this

129
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,300
dexterity roll, you will fall down into the muddy basin.

130
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
I pass.

131
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Okay, then you are teetering on the edge, and your toes curl over within the shoes,

132
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:07,300
and the mud slips out from underneath you, but you can gain enough balance to stay atop

133
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,300
on the edge of this, what would you call that?

134
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Precipice.

135
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Oh!

136
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
Nice.

137
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Precipice and poo at the same time.

138
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Clark Bishop, what do you do?

139
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,300
I guess I'm keeping the intro.

140
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Keith is being dragged into the now open door.

141
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Do I still have my shot lined up on Adam?

142
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,300
You wouldn't get the plus 20 bonus because you were looking at a different world.

143
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Okay.

144
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
And Adam is the one showing me a Ryan Gosling movie?

145
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
That is correct.

146
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,300
He's your teacher in an inner-city school.

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Sweet.

148
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
I think I want to take a shot at him.

149
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Okay.

150
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Don't hit me, please.

151
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
That's my only debate.

152
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Do I maybe say something first?

153
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,300
We all watched Hamilton this weekend, so we know you're not going to miss your shot.

154
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,300
All right, so are you going to throw away your shot, or are you going to take a shot?

155
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm not going to throw away my shot.

156
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
I'm taking a shot at Adam.

157
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,300
I knew I was getting it wrong.

158
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
I was going to let it happen, but then I decided not to.

159
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,300
You're at a negative 20 for firearms in order to not hit Keith Vigna unless you want to roll at a normal,

160
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,300
and then I'll roll a chance that you hit him.

161
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Did that make any sense?

162
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I don't know.

163
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
That didn't make sense to me, so I'll start over.

164
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,300
I'm just like my country. I'm young, friendly, and horny.

165
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,300
That's right, right?

166
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
And I'm not going to throw away my shot.

167
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I'm young, friendly, and full of cum.

168
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,300
That was the first draft.

169
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
He revised that one.

170
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,300
He's playing it. Lin-Manuel's playing it for the Obamas.

171
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,300
So what do you think?

172
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Michelle's like, I have one note.

173
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,300
All right, I'm taking a negative 20. That puts my firearms at 60. Here we go.

174
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,300
I do not pass. It's a 91.

175
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Shoot.

176
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:20,300
As soon as you fire, it releases a held action, which means that in combat someone can decide during their turn

177
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:28,300
that as soon as this thing happens, I will take my action, and you immediately hear a gunshot ring out.

178
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,300
And you see the gun at the back of Kerry Page's head.

179
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,300
No.

180
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:47,300
And the hand holding that gun fucking explodes, and there's just a nub on the end of this forearm of Casey Kristoff

181
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,300
as he screams like, oh, hey, dude, not me. Oh, shit, man.

182
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Holy shit.

183
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:59,300
As the man falls to the ground, Drew Kerry, Kerry Page's inside out, whatever the fuck you want to call Kerry Andrews,

184
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,300
gets up and just fucking elbows him right in the face and grabs the gun.

185
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
Bubble gum tree.

186
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Yes, dude.

187
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Bubble gum tree.

188
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Bubble gum tree.

189
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,300
You do not know where this shot was fired from, and it is John Lee Pettymore the third's turn.

190
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
Oh, my God.

191
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah, I'd like to overpower the cat to get my ammo back.

192
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,300
John, when you look down at this cat, it is looking at you with both fear and necessity and want.

193
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Since it's an FBI agent in a cat's body, can I persuade it?

194
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Absolutely.

195
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,300
It's just trying to get this clip away from you, and so it's with its mouth, and then with its paw,

196
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,300
it's trying to move your gun through the mud.

197
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I hold my hand out palm first. Hold on there.

198
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Listen, you're in law enforcement.

199
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,300
I was what I once was once might have been considered law enforcement.

200
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Now, Adam Kane over there probably told you he could get your body back.

201
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,300
But really, he just wants to open a portal to the past and fuck everything else and, like, take it for himself.

202
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
The whole world.

203
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
That's my working theory.

204
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:14,300
So if you give me that ammo back, I can stop them and I can help you get your body, which totally still exists.

205
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Roll persuade.

206
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Does his body exist?

207
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
I don't remember.

208
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Totally.

209
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
I mean, depending on the time of day, it might still be around.

210
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Fuck!

211
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Oh, that's a really good point.

212
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
73 on a 60.

213
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
What happened to his body? I don't remember.

214
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
He was killed in the fish tank room.

215
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Oh, okay. That's right.

216
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.

217
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Yeah.

218
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:47,300
This cat continues to back away from you and immediately with one of its paws begins filling the bottom of your pistol with mud.

219
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,300
So where the magazine would normally go, it's throwing dirt and mud and rocks in there.

220
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,300
This guy doesn't know anything about guns. Bullets go there.

221
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I thought you were talking about me and I was like, oh, could he still fire like that?

222
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
I don't believe so.

223
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
It's just mud bullets then, yeah.

224
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
You can shoot anything out of a gun if you put it in the bottom of it.

225
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Keith Vigna, you're being dragged backwards through the mud by Pastor Adam Kane in a Ryan Gosling film.

226
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Hold.

227
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Okay, quick question. So one of my arms is up like this, I guess?

228
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,300
He's got you underneath your arms with his palms on the back of your neck.

229
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
That'd be a full Nelson, right?

230
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Oh, sorry.

231
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Then twice a Ryan Gosling.

232
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Okay, so it is a full Nelson.

233
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,300
Yeah, he's got you in a full Nelson.

234
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,300
I'm just going to try to drop dead weight and try to flip him over me.

235
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Okay, sounds good. Roll unarmed combat against Pastor Adam Kane who succeeds with a 37 on a 40.

236
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
God damn it.

237
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,300
He is grabbing his camera and he is showing us an 88.

238
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Yay.

239
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:26,300
You drop dead weight and a strength that only comes from a man who is getting revenge for the death of his entire family comes through Pastor Adam Kane as he lifts you completely up off the ground and gripping somehow through this mud, he just dives backwards into the square hole.

240
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Oh, no.

241
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Oh, fuck.

242
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Into whatever is past this door and Keith, you see a square of light ahead of you as you fall.

243
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,300
You guys hear, this won't bring your family back.

244
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,300
And then you all hear a thump and the door begins closing.

245
00:15:49,300 --> 00:16:03,300
And when I say the door is closing, it is this metal plate that has slid completely parallel to the ground, horizontal if you will, and it is now sliding back the other way shut.

246
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Indiana Jones, this shit.

247
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
That might be the only way.

248
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:14,300
And with that is Pastor Adam Kane's turn and I need Thomas and Joe to take their headphones off.

249
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Don't kill me.

250
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Luke, you see this light above you as you land with a thud on top of Pastor Adam Kane.

251
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Your back lands on him and he hits his head and gets knocked out.

252
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Straight up.

253
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Yes.

254
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Is it lit other than the light from the hole?

255
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,300
The only thing is the light from above.

256
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,300
And you're just in there, it's basically concrete, four concrete walls with a concrete floor.

257
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:04,300
And on one of the walls, you see that there is a circle that is made of like the same metal that the door was made out of.

258
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Just a circle.

259
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Yep, just a circle.

260
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Just like there was a square above you.

261
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Oh, okay.

262
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Yeah, it looks like an impassable metal plate, but it's a big circle instead of a big square.

263
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
Go first, take two damage from the fall.

264
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
How many hit points did you have?

265
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,300
I have ten and, well, I had ten, now I have eight.

266
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Oh shit, dude.

267
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Yeah.

268
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Okay, I see that he's knocked out.

269
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
Can I search him for any weapons?

270
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Yeah, he doesn't have any weapons on him, he just is wearing this helmet.

271
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:40,300
And when you're kind of like searching all over him, he really, he didn't have a weapon on him.

272
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:48,300
But this helmet, the light is neither red nor green, and you see that the back, there's some glass.

273
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
And it's shattered.

274
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
The tubes have shattered as he fell.

275
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Okay, I want to take that off of him and put it on myself.

276
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
I want to approach the circle.

277
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
There's nothing on it, no writing or anything?

278
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
No writing, no nothing.

279
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
I just want to put my hand on it.

280
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,300
Casey Kristoff screams, oh man, oh no.

281
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:24,300
And immediately gets on his knees and puts his one hand and one forearm up in the air.

282
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,300
And Kerry Pages gets behind him.

283
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Okay, now that the roles have been reversed, you will do the same as I did, which was nothing.

284
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Please do not move.

285
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Clark Bishop, it is your turn.

286
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:42,300
I want to be running toward the door, but scanning the perimeter for the other shooter.

287
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Okay, so do first a dexterity or athletics at a negative 20?

288
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm doing decks and I fail.

289
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Yeah, I fail.

290
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,300
As you're like running down the hill, there's just too much bounce in trying to like keep your balance.

291
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:06,300
You're not going to be able to roll search or alertness to try to see where the shot was coming from.

292
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:14,300
And as you're going down, you trip on a rock and you kind of slip, do one of those banana peel slips,

293
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:22,300
and you fall right on your ass and mud begins piling up as you're sliding down in your crotch area.

294
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Do you know how mud might do that?

295
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,300
This is the worst time to look so uncool.

296
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,300
I know, you look very silly.

297
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,300
And you got brown crotch, it's just all muddy down there.

298
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Yeah, okay.

299
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Good turn.

300
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
John Lee Pettymore, what do you do?

301
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
That's great.

302
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
And you shit your pants and you pee a little.

303
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Everybody starts screaming at you, holy shit Clark, did you shit your pants?

304
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,300
The whole town of contention is somehow back alive and watching.

305
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,300
They're all holding hands.

306
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
This wasn't the actual reality, they're all watching you.

307
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,300
You see your parents standing before you and they were pointing.

308
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Hands around Bean's pond.

309
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:20,300
So John is being a good midwesterner and he's both averting his eyes from Clark,

310
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,300
but also just mouthing like, oh my God.

311
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
As he's just running for the door.

312
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Okay.

313
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Give me a dexterity or athletics.

314
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
50 on a 55 dex.

315
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Nice.

316
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
50 on a 55 dex.

317
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Anything else?

318
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,300
No, he's really trying not to look at Clark.

319
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Thanks for not looking at me, John.

320
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:57,300
You make it to the metal door as it completes its closure.

321
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:04,300
And as soon as you get there, you slide up in this mud to once again an impassable metal plate.

322
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,300
A metal door buried in the ground.

323
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
A critical success would have gotten you there.

324
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,300
That or trying to put something in it to Indiana Jones it were your only options.

325
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,300
That's the kind of game do you want to play here, Zach?

326
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
I have it written in my notes.

327
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,300
That we can only critical success or Indiana Jones it?

328
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,300
It literally says it slides into a metal door.

329
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Indiana Jones it?

330
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,300
It literally says it slides shut during that round and they have to crit or do something cool to get in.

331
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Nice.

332
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
So essentially, yeah.

333
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I did something cool. I helped out a friend.

334
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
I was modest, dammit.

335
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Okay.

336
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Can I start pawing at this door in front of me?

337
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,300
Yeah, you can.

338
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:07,300
And then pawing at the mud behind you is Agent Trent Catt, which has followed you down into the basin and is now at the radio and is on top of it.

339
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,300
I slam my fist on the door in the mud and say, why, Keith, why?

340
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Okay, so you're?

341
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I'm pounding on the door and I'm screaming Adrian and not looking at Joe.

342
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Hey, look, a bar.

343
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Hello.

344
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Hello.

345
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:42,300
I was reading about Seth Putnam as soon as I don't know who that is.

346
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,300
He's the lead singer of Anal Cunt.

347
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Okay.

348
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:59,300
So as you're in this room, you put your hand up against this circular metal plate on the wall and the door above you finishes closing.

349
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:08,300
And then as soon as it's finished closing, you hear banging from above and you hear John Lee Pettymore the Thirth screaming.

350
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Why, Keith, why?

351
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,300
Dammit, Keith, I'm sorry, we couldn't get to you or something like that.

352
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:23,300
I wish that I could have helped aid you on your role that you failed, I assume.

353
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Or you could have tried harder.

354
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
Yes, he could have tried harder is what I.

355
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Would he be able to hear me if I talked?

356
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Yeah, but as soon as that door closes and you hear this noise, the circular plate right ahead of you that you have your hand on begins opening from the middle.

357
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,300
It's doing that cool like.

358
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Oh, where it's like.

359
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Spiral.

360
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Spirally like.

361
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Yeah, it's cool.

362
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Neat.

363
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Yeah, it's very neat.

364
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I'm gonna yell up.

365
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Hey, there's a door.

366
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Door's opening up down here.

367
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Can you hear me?

368
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
You motherfucker.

369
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Okay.

370
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,300
John, as you're banging on this door, you hear a voice from the other side.

371
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Hey, can you hear me?

372
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Is that the ghost of my friend?

373
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm alive.

374
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Lay still, restless spirit.

375
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
I'm alive still.

376
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,300
John, I landed on the pastor.

377
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
He's knocked out.

378
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I'm good.

379
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
You didn't get sent back in time.

380
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
No, but there's a door.

381
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
The pastor's not Silas Cole.

382
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:46,300
He broke my fall with his body and head and the helmet got a little smashed.

383
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Well.

384
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,300
So there's no light on and one of the tubes is broken, but I am wearing it.

385
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Nothing's happened yet.

386
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Oh, well, maybe take that off.

387
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Let's just count our blessings that he's knocked out and it's broken.

388
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,300
I've avoided one head trauma already.

389
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I'd like to avoid any in the future, so I'm gonna keep it on.

390
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:13,300
Do you think after all the modifications to that thing, it still functions for its original intended, like, safety purposes?

391
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
I don't know.

392
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Hopefully I don't need to find out, but the tube's broken, so I don't think it's gonna be working anyway.

393
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
There's a door down there?

394
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Yeah, just as soon as that one that you're on shut, this one opened up.

395
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
It's like a circle.

396
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I'm about to go in it.

397
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,300
I just wanted you guys to let you guys know that I'm safe.

398
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
As safe as I can be again.

399
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Wait, wait, wait for us!

400
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,300
I don't know.

401
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Let me survey my surroundings and see how many feet I think down I am from you.

402
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
You're a beans, right?

403
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:50,300
I'm about, I would say, ten feet from that door and I don't know how to open it up.

404
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Are you a beans or are you not a beans?

405
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,300
I'm a freakin' Keith Beans, baby.

406
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Well then think real hard about this door and open it for us.

407
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Is the room I'm in small enough to, like, do this up, you know?

408
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,300
He is currently trying, he's doing what a person who can't swim thinks swimming is.

409
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,300
I think it's what he's doing with his arms currently.

410
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Like, I wanna, like, press my arms and legs up against the wall and try to climb up it.

411
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,300
Yeah, it's a little bit, it's about six feet across.

412
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Yeah, I'd probably hurt myself doing that anyway, so good.

413
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
That'd be really difficult.

414
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
You can try if you want.

415
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,300
I think I'm stuck down here.

416
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Wish me luck, I guess.

417
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Should I, what do you think I should do with Adam?

418
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
He's passed out.

419
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Should I just leave him here?

420
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Ask him how he opened the door.

421
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Well, he's unconscious right now and I, like, kinda nudge him with my foot.

422
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Is there any reaction?

423
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I'm not telling you.

424
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
He does not seem to be awake.

425
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Yeah, no, there's no reaction.

426
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I think he's out cold.

427
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,300
I'm gonna leave him here unless you think I should kill him.

428
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
Oh, you should kill him!

429
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
No!

430
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Is Clark there?

431
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Keith!

432
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Keith!

433
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Kill him!

434
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Now!

435
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Kill him!

436
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Well, what if we need information from him?

437
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Uh-uh, no.

438
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Who cares?

439
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Clark, Clark, can you hear me?

440
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,300
I mean, I, I, I'm, lest be left, I'm way far away.

441
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
I think at this point you've, you've at least watched.

442
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,300
You've seen me screaming at the door.

443
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Clark, as you, as you finally decide to stand, uh, you're well aware of the stain on your

444
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,300
pants, but you're looking over and you can see that, uh, this cat is on top of the radio

445
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,300
and is violently pointing one paw at the broken tube and pointing the other paw at John Lee

446
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Pettymore, the Thirth.

447
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,300
But John is, you know, on top of this metal plate, either banging on it or yelling through

448
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,300
it, so.

449
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Clark!

450
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Keith, Keith, are you, are you down there?

451
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
You, you all right?

452
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,300
Clark, Keith's down there.

453
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,300
He landed on top of Pastor Adam Kane and he's got him knocked out silly and he wants to

454
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
know if he should just leave him before he moves on to the next door or if she should

455
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,300
kill him.

456
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
I said kill him, right?

457
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Do you have your gun on you down there?

458
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
I look around.

459
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Is my gun down here with me?

460
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:18,300
At this moment, Clark Bishop, you hear a whoa and looking at the stump at the end of one

461
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:24,300
of the forearms, Casey Kristoff, enough blood has splattered up out of this forearm that

462
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,300
his eyes just kind of go wobbly and then the rest of his body weebles, wobbles, but it

463
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,300
definitely falls down and he just kind of like passes out on his side and Kerry pages

464
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
looks at you guys and does a shrug.

465
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
I mean, we weren't paying attention to him anyways.

466
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
I'm just saying.

467
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
That's what the listeners see, asshole.

468
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Do I have my gun on me down here?

469
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Uh, yeah.

470
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:54,300
I was thinking about, uh, you know, just leaving him out, knocked out, but if he comes

471
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
to, I don't want him to attack me.

472
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
John thinks I should kill him.

473
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
What do you think?

474
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,300
I don't know about killing him because I'd like to know what he knows about all this.

475
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
What was his plan?

476
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm going to like shoot him in the foot so he can't chase me.

477
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
How about that?

478
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,300
He can probably heal with his dark lord.

479
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Kill him.

480
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
Fuck what he knows.

481
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,300
We can ask his fucking wife what he knew.

482
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:24,300
Oh, we can ask his second in command what he knew.

483
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
You know what I mean?

484
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Kill that fool.

485
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,300
I'm going to like do this with my shoulders to cover my ears and like, what'd you do?

486
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,300
I'm going to do this with one ear and then the other one, I'm going to do that.

487
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,300
He's currently, he's sticking one, shoot him in the foot and then he's covering his

488
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,300
other ear with a shoulder while holding the gun with the shoulder covered arm.

489
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
And then one finger in my ear.

490
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
All right.

491
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,300
And where are you shooting him?

492
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,300
In the foot.

493
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,300
Ker-pow.

494
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Damn it, Keith, at least take both feet.

495
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,300
Do I hit him?

496
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,300
We hear the gunshot from up top.

497
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Keith, did you, did you, did you kill him?

498
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,300
No, I, I shot him in the foot cause if he comes through then he won't chase me.

499
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,300
He'll, or at least not, uh, well.

500
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,300
Not, not speedily.

501
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Yeah, exactly.

502
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,300
Shoot him in both feet.

503
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
I shoot him in the other foot.

504
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
He's got a decent chance now of bleeding out.

505
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,300
This is what we call an elegant compromise, gentlemen.

506
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
All right, let me roll some dice.

507
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
This is, this is, uh.

508
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Also after I shoot him in the other foot, I want to like put his feet up on the wall

509
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
so they're elevated so they don't bleed as much.

510
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,300
What the fuck?

511
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
God damn it.

512
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Guys.

513
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
That's incredible.

514
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
I have to kill him.

515
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Okay.

516
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,300
Do you think anything he knows is going to help us save the town?

517
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
I don't know.

518
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I don't want one more body on my conscious.

519
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,300
I really, I'm, I'm kind of hoping that Adam is on the right track and we can use it for

520
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
our purposes and not bad ones.

521
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Yeah.

522
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,300
Well, not his bad ones.

523
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
All right.

524
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
Keith, what are you doing?

525
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,300
I'm going through that hole.

526
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I step over the threshold into where, is it dark or can I see, what do I see?

527
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:44,300
As soon as this one opens, there's light coming from down and on the other side of this circular

528
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:53,300
entrance, there are metal ladder rungs that are going down and there's light coming from

529
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
down.

530
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Okay.

531
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,300
I peek my head back through the hole and I say, sleep tight.

532
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,300
And then I go down the ladder.

533
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Okay.

534
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:11,300
And when you make it down the ladder rungs, you are standing on top of a metal mining

535
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,300
elevator and it's got a door on the top that swings open that you can jump down into the

536
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,300
elevator.

537
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,300
I swing it open and I jumped down into the elevator.

538
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:26,300
And you, there's a button there that you can control like a power strip looking thing that

539
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
hangs from the ceiling.

540
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
I press down on it.

541
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
And you start.

542
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,300
Is this good?

543
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:52,300
And you stop basically this whole way down.

544
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:59,300
It was just a rock was around you and where there would be one of the metal cage walls,

545
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
there just was opening to the rock.

546
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
So you could reach out and touch the rock.

547
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Whereas the other three walls were metal cage.

548
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Okay.

549
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:14,300
But at the very bottom, instead of rock where it is open to you, there is a blast door.

550
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
There's a what?

551
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
A blast door.

552
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Okay.

553
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:25,300
So it's like round on the top and there's a big like circular window all fogged up and

554
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
old and musty.

555
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:34,300
And then there's a big wheel and then there's a large arm that is latched locking this door

556
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
shut.

557
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Okay.

558
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,300
I want to try to unlatch it and use the wheel for whatever it does.

559
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Yeah.

560
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,300
So you unlatch this big metal locking mechanism essentially.

561
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:54,300
And then you as the wheel, it's like it's been a while since this cold metal.

562
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
I spit on it a little bit.

563
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah.

564
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
It gets it.

565
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,300
Oh, and it gets it going.

566
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,300
I like that.

567
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:12,300
And so you open up this door and it opens and you feel the room almost pressurize as

568
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
it's just been so long.

569
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah.

570
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
You got to pop my ears.

571
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:23,300
It's like I'm on an airplane in the earth and it opens up into the bottom of the earth

572
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:29,300
and it opens up in the astronaut movie where they drill, which I forget what that one was

573
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
called or Armageddon.

574
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
I don't remember.

575
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Definitely Armageddon.

576
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:42,300
So I go in behind this heavy metal blast door is a cavernous laboratory.

577
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:49,300
It smells musty earthy with a tinge of mold and the air is thick and humid.

578
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,300
The floor is poorly laid concrete, rough and uneven and concrete covers about six feet

579
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,300
up the walls before the rock of the cave structure takes over to form 10 more feet of wall that

580
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:10,300
slowly becomes a cathedral ceiling complete with stalactites dripping fruitlessly on the

581
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,300
concrete floor below.

582
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Lining the right side of the room are these massive copper vats with all sorts of gauges

583
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,300
and tubing on them.

584
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,300
The left side is an absolute mess of tables and shelves with papers and folders strewn

585
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,300
about haphazardly over this workstation in total disarray.

586
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:39,300
And finally on the far side of the subterranean chamber there is another metal blast door.

587
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,300
The lever and wheel to open this thick threshold are on your side and again there is a round

588
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,300
window looking into whatever is on the other side.

589
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:57,300
I want to go over to the tables and kind of like look at the papers and see what they're

590
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
all about.

591
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:06,300
You find blueprints for a gun, a radio, a helmet, and a camera.

592
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Hell yeah.

593
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,300
These things are clearly made with this math.

594
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,300
There's math all over these pages and looking at it doesn't make a whole lot of sense

595
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,300
to you but you didn't go to school for mathematics so I'm assuming you don't have a math

596
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,300
skill on your character sheet?

597
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
No.

598
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
Go ahead and roll intelligence for me.

599
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
It's my lowest.

600
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Imagine that.

601
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,300
42 on a 50.

602
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:38,300
Okay so you know just by looking at these that certain equations don't quote unquote

603
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,300
add up.

604
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:47,300
Something about this math is incorrect to you but it seems to be working on the page.

605
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:55,300
He's making or she whatever is making these blueprints based on this science.

606
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,300
However there's a whole other set of papers that seem to be devoted.

607
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
It's like this one notebook.

608
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:10,300
It's trying to come up with some sort of word combination that will grant eternal life

609
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
is what it says.

610
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:20,300
However there are notes on each page of each time this has been used and the complications

611
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,300
and the complications are brutal.

612
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:34,300
The first is like thinning of skin and the second one says removal of nails and the third

613
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:47,300
one is like hair has begun falling out and the final one says humanity seems to be gone.

614
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Fuck.

615
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,300
You find this giant folder.

616
00:37:52,300 --> 00:38:03,300
It's working on something called manipulating activator robot A and it is a picture of a

617
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:13,300
one inch in diameter circular ball and there are 24 of them and each one A B C they're

618
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,300
all crossed out.

619
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
All of them.

620
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Until the final page the 25th one that says manipulating activator colon robot Y codename

621
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Mary.

622
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Mary.

623
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Mary and Mary Cole.

624
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,300
I wonder if it's Mary Cole.

625
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Is she a robot?

626
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Is there anything else written on the piece of paper?

627
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,300
At the bottom it says host found.

628
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Ooh.

629
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Ooh.

630
00:38:53,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Ooh.

631
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Did you die in other world Luke?

632
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I'm in the basement of Bean's Pond.

633
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,300
I'm still alive as far as I know.

634
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
You still in a hole?

635
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,300
I'm in a hole.

636
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,300
I'm deep in a hole.

637
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
That's boring.

638
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
What I did is not boring.

639
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
No it didn't look like it.

640
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
Okay bye bye.

641
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,300
Goodbye.

642
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Goodbye.

643
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,300
You guys hear another door inside of wherever Keith Figna has disappeared to another door

644
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,300
inside you kind of hear it go and then there's just silence.

645
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,300
Carrie Pages begins walking cautiously down the muddy hillside.

646
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
Bubblegum tree.

647
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Bubblegum tree.

648
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Pointing at her own body and saying I don't even know.

649
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,300
Drew we know.

650
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
We know Drew.

651
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,300
We know it's you.

652
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,300
We've been calling you Drew Carey.

653
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Am I now?

654
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
Can I just be Drew then please?

655
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,300
I don't know it's kind of funny when you talk.

656
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Do you know do you know where my body is?

657
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
Last we left it it was in the sewer.

658
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
What?

659
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
What?

660
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
It's in a safe place.

661
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Okay then not just in the sewer waters.

662
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,300
No no no not just like floating down there it's in Harry and Gary are with it actually.

663
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Well that's much better than what I thought when you said my body is in the sewers.

664
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,300
It's so good to see you guys.

665
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Did you get eyes on that shooter?

666
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,300
Did you see where that shot came from?

667
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:39,300
When you all look over you see there's a slight opening like a walkway in this floating moat

668
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:52,300
this water and walking right through it is...

669
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
You bastard.

670
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,300
He's gotta roll a character.

671
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Hold on let me just find a Patreon character real quick.

672
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:11,300
It's a woman wearing an emerald green smoking jacket with a black silk bow tie and she is

673
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:20,300
smiling a cold vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes and you recognize

674
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
her immediately as Karen.

675
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
And love.

676
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Two different people you recognize her as two different people.

677
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,300
Oh is Karen not the smile lady?

678
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
No 100% you got it right.

679
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Gotcha.

680
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:41,300
And she is holding this like badass looking rifle got a super long barrel on it but it

681
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:47,300
clearly she's like folding the stock up into the gun to where it literally becomes just

682
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,300
like a handheld thing but it's still got this long barrel on it that she then turns

683
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,300
and then makes that shorter as well and turns it back into just like a handgun.

684
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,300
She holsters it on her side and holds up both of her hands.

685
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:08,300
I am just as confused as the both of you.

686
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Clark pulls his gun on her.

687
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:15,300
No that is understandable I'm sure but you know it's been a while so I think now that

688
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:20,300
we're both circle of knowledge members maybe we can let bygones be bygones.

689
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,300
Bygones be bygones?

690
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,300
It's my parents and you killed my fucking parents.

691
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:32,300
Yeah I know I know I know it's my bad it's my bad it's my bad but it was my job I was

692
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:39,300
looking for the book you know Jim sent me to look for the book it's not my issue I was

693
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,300
given you know orders.

694
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
Clark is going to kind of approach her with the gun.

695
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,300
She's pointing at Kevin.

696
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Kevin you know what I'm talking about also what the fuck it's good to see you it's been

697
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,300
so long what the where have you been?

698
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,300
Some aliens took me remind me where we were the last remind me what happened the last

699
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,300
time that kind of fuzzed my memory what was the last time I saw you?

700
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Shit let's see Clark could you put that down for I mean just like aim it not at me I guess

701
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,300
for now although I've heard you've got the hell of a trigger finger anyway don't aim

702
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
it at me please.

703
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,300
I don't think I will and I keep it pointed at her.

704
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Also fair.

705
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,300
Oh shit Kevin did you like lose your memory or some shit?

706
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Yeah that's what happened.

707
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
That is such a bummer.

708
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Because of the aliens.

709
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Oh what did they look like?

710
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Classic little gray men.

711
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
All those kooks were right.

712
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,300
I've never seen those.

713
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,300
I've seen the tall ones the lanky fellas.

714
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,300
Mine were little.

715
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Huh.

716
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:49,300
Okay so I guess last time we were going through with that whole deal to fuck over Marvin Glass

717
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,300
right?

718
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,300
And then you just disappeared you and Kyle I never saw you again.

719
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,300
How were we gonna fuck over Marvin Glass?

720
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,300
Well we stole all this cocaine and all that weapon shit man you remember that?

721
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,300
We were gonna sell it but then after you guys got caught I just dipped out I got the fuck

722
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
out of there.

723
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,300
Sure sure and did you leave it in our green box?

724
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
Yeah.

725
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,300
Good thinking good thinking Karen good job good work.

726
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Yeah along with all the other shit I mean wait did you end up getting the rest of the

727
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,300
vectors?

728
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,300
Because I couldn't find any ever and then I ended up just going a whole other direction.

729
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Jim recruited me to this thing that Clark and I are now in Circle of Knowledge.

730
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Kevin Clark have you told Kevin about Circle of Knowledge?

731
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
I've mentioned it.

732
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,300
We call it cock.

733
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:38,300
I've never thought about that I love cock.

734
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,300
The stuff we're doing there is great like K cell was one thing but like this shit is

735
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,300
legitimately staving off the end of the world swear to god.

736
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,300
You mentioned Kyle who was Kyle?

737
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,300
Kevin do you want to take this do you know what happened to Kyle?

738
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
Tell him Karen.

739
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Wait hold on I but you guys disappeared the same day you guys were out what are you doing?

740
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,300
You were running to Apples Beans to go get coffee?

741
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,300
Apples Beans I did enjoy Apples Beans I've got to tell you Karen.

742
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Since the abduction it's just a blur.

743
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,300
Yeah that makes sense.

744
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Oh shit who's this one?

745
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,300
And she points at Drew.

746
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,300
That's the city councilwoman she doesn't know about any of this.

747
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,300
Oh well then we should probably fucking kill her.

748
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,300
No no no I mean.

749
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,300
No offense sorry you just shouldn't have this information and continue to live but then

750
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,300
again I guess this whole town's gonna have to die.

751
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,300
She doesn't know what we're talking about none of this town has to die.

752
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,300
Look around you and you all see that you're still in this you know the pond's not in

753
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,300
the pond but it is you know around you in a big wall.

754
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,300
What's your point?

755
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,300
Well it's just that you know it's kind of our job to make sure that normal people no

756
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,300
offense don't have this kind of knowledge.

757
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,300
Alright listen Karen I didn't know if I could trust you but she's a familiar.

758
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
She's a what?

759
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,300
A friendly.

760
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,300
Oh okay I thought you meant like a witch's cat.

761
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Yeah I said the wrong thing first didn't I?

762
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,300
You saved her why'd you why'd you why'd you save the councilwoman here?

763
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:14,300
Oh I was listening in on this whole situation and it seemed like you guys were on her side

764
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,300
and so I figured I'd take out the fucking hillbilly.

765
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,300
That was a good read we are on our side she's one of our good friends and she's a friendly.

766
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,300
And why is this cat an actual seeming familiar pointing with its paws so intelligently?

767
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:36,300
That is a an FBI agent that you know what if we'd done things your way Karen we should

768
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,300
have just killed him right away but instead we needed his body to have the alright see

769
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:49,300
first this guy named Doug got he got put in the body of that cat right?

770
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,300
Sure I'm I'm following.

771
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,300
His mind was in there his mind was in that cat and we we like Doug Doug was working with

772
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:04,300
us and there was this FBI agent that we didn't like he was not working with us so we you

773
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:13,300
know we did a little mind switcheroo and we put Doug cat into FBI agents body and now

774
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,300
the FBI agent is in the his mind is in the body of the cat and he really wants out and

775
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,300
he hates us.

776
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,300
Wait is that the FBI agent that was sent to deal with you guys?

777
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Clark you were sent to take care of him right?

778
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,300
Yeah that's how we did it.

779
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,300
Oh yeah no he's not FBI I mean he you know he's kind of FBI but he's mostly working for

780
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,300
the asylum it's good that he's actually in a cat body that's perfect.

781
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,300
Well what's the asylum?

782
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,300
Well that's the okay Kevin you remember we were working K cell stuff eliminating the

783
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,300
vectors after that whole debacle in the woods and we were getting close to finishing when

784
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,300
we fast and furious that semi to steal Marvin Glass's shipment well right around that time

785
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:58,300
you and Kyle disappeared and Jim told me the asylum was shifting into a more bureaucratic

786
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,300
machine focusing more on obtaining technology rather than thwarting world ending vectors

787
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,300
so that's when he brought me into the circle of knowledge.

788
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
Do you know how long he'd been with the circle?

789
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,300
Jim?

790
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,300
Yeah.

791
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Fuck as long as we've known him but yeah no this this little cat here was sent to actually

792
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:23,300
collect any sort of unnatural technology so likely looking for the book like we all

793
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:31,300
were but then certainly that black bag and the camera and what was it the radio?

794
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,300
How do you know all this?

795
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,300
Well I mean Clark told Leon about all that stuff.

796
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,300
McKinley and Harrison are they the asylum also?

797
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,300
McKinley and Harrison I get it that's cute.

798
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,300
You know they kind of helped us in the end.

799
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,300
Oh yeah no they're extremely helpful I'm it's just everybody's you know kind of doing the

800
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,300
same thing in different ways.

801
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,300
I guess that makes sense.

802
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,300
That could be like yeah the final line of the podcast.

803
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:12,300
I guess that makes sense.

804
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,300
Keith gets really excited and like tons of thoughts are running through his head but

805
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,300
he doesn't really know what to do with the information yet.

806
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:26,300
I'm like I really wish that those guys could get down here but also and then I pick up

807
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:35,300
the sheet of paper that has like the eternal life thing and I look at it and I'm I like

808
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:41,300
touch my bullet hole in my hip and then I look down at my ribs and I've got blood all

809
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:49,300
over my hand and I look at it and I say I hope my penis doesn't fall off and then I

810
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,300
say the words.

811
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Oh my god dude.

812
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,300
Yes.

813
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,300
Oh fuck yeah.

814
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,300
Okay the last ones.

815
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,300
What do you mean?

816
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,300
There were multiple they were tribal in error.

817
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,300
I'll do the one that I'll say the one that you lose your nails.

818
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,300
Okay.

819
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,300
Al-hai-a-oob-dee.

820
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Does anything happen?

821
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Nothing happens.

822
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,300
Al-hai-a-oob-dee.

823
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,300
Al-hai-a-oob-dee.

824
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Al-hai-a-oob-dee.

825
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,300
Al-hai-a-oob-dee.

826
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:32,300
Your bones begin to vibrate underneath your muscles and tendons your skeleton is shivering

827
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:39,300
and every single one of your fingernails and toenails feel like they are being pulled

828
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:47,300
up from the tips but instead of lifting from your nail beds the pain buzzes and the buzzing

829
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:56,300
grows and then your nails begin snapping off like popcorn popping and when the last kernel

830
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:05,300
of a nail has dissected itself from your being you hear a foreboding thud as something

831
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:14,300
slams into the other side of the blast door on the far end of this underground lab.

832
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,300
Oh fuck yeah.

833
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:54,300
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

834
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:04,300
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

835
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:17,300
With no mind at all, no mind at all.
