0	4200	Welcome, listeners new and less new.
4200	10120	I've been informed by my producer that it is perfectly fine for anyone to start right
10120	12160	here if they want to.
12160	15240	No previous episodes are required.
15240	20640	These next four episodes, they are here for all of you, dear listeners.
20640	25840	However, the previous episodes are pretty good, so I've been told.
25840	32720	I still have not gotten access to a smart device to listen to these so-called podcasts
32720	35120	I hear y'all screeching about.
35120	41440	Feel free to go back to the start of season two, or heck, even go all the way back to
41440	43120	season one.
43120	50120	Okay, now that I got that stuff out of the way, I can properly introduce myself.
50120	59400	I am DJ Wolf the Dog, and you are listening to the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP,
59400	65440	the crustiest and mustiest radio station this side of the Great Lake.
65440	67240	You all know the one.
67240	69500	I heard it's got fish in it.
69500	76600	Now we hear it pretending to be people love to receive fan mail in the form of electronic
76600	77600	mail.
77600	84320	When I get one I like, I go ahead and scream it out loud in everyone's favorite segment,
84320	85800	Howlin' with Wolf.
85800	91360	This very special edition of Howlin' with Wolf is one of those breathtakingly beautiful
91360	100260	five-star reviews from Apple Podcast, and it's from I gots a cool in Great Britain.
100260	106120	If you talk about wolf in your five-star review, I just might howl at two.
106120	108980	I gots a cool rights.
108980	111680	This show is just the real deal.
111680	115240	Stellar writing and an amazing cast.
115240	120200	Just finished the first season in all of the extra one shots and about to start season
120200	121340	two.
121340	126880	Thank you for providing me with entertainment whilst I drive my forklift every night for
126880	128920	the last couple months.
128920	135120	And thank you for inspiring me to run my own Delta Green scenario.
135120	137000	Keep up that good work.
137000	139600	This bit's just for you, Wolf.
139600	142000	Keep on howlin' the way you do.
142000	145720	Ain't nobody eatin' the trash quite like you.
145720	149040	Well, thank you, dear listener.
149040	156640	Your review makes the sparkle in my producer's eyes shine once more, and I can say I also
156640	159440	appreciate the things you said to me.
159440	162360	I hope you have fun liftin' them forks.
162360	166080	Sounds like a dream job to ol' Wolfie.
166080	171760	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod on an
171760	179000	Instagram story or an Instagram post, or tag at pretending pod on a Twitter tweet, or tag
179000	184800	pretending to be people on a Facebook post or a Facebook comment on a post, or like you
184800	190800	heard before, write up a five-star review and mention this here wolf.
190800	193640	Howl!
193640	196880	Cough cough cough.
196880	201960	Welcome back to 694.2 PTBP.
201960	207960	You're listening to Wolf the Dog, and I am, what, I'm having a premonition?
207960	210680	Oh gods, what is this?
210680	214360	If you can hear me, just imagine what I'm seeing.
214360	218560	I see a boring hotel conference room.
218560	227520	It's so ugly, and there's a nerd in there, and he's an archaeologist, a public speaker,
227520	230960	a crystal doctor or something.
230960	236160	I don't know, but definitely a nerd, and there's something else.
236160	243640	In a hotel room, there's a skinny man in a boss man suit with greased back, slicked back
243640	252000	hair, and he's watching someone die, get murdered, geez louise.
252000	253000	What's next?
253000	263180	Oh my, it's the jungle, so jungly, so viney, y'all miss vine sometimes, no more premonitions,
263180	267800	only vague and subtle hints through the gift of song.
267800	273160	It's Hudson Freeman with Muscles R. Springs.
297800	314480	If it's some consolation, I was thinking the same thing.
314480	327120	I am now mechanization, all my muscles work like swings.
327120	332960	What's up everybody, we're back here pretending to be people with another short story within
332960	340000	the larger story of season two, and we are going to take you on a small journey within
340000	343560	the city, along with a special guest.
343560	349120	You might know her from the Good Time Society, you might know her from Dimension 20, Black
349120	355240	Dice Society, her work with Wizards of the Coast, Magic the Gathering, her Twitch channel,
355240	361200	Geek and Sundry, her appearances on Glass Cannon Podcast, it's Becca Scott.
361200	367680	Oh my God, you made me sound so fancy.
367680	369800	I guess I did do all that stuff.
369800	371800	I think you might be fancy.
371800	376060	I'm retiring, gotta go.
376060	380960	She lived a long and storied career and she's gone, we got our last words here at pretending
380960	381960	to be people.
381960	382960	Rest in peace.
382960	385800	You might die when you retire.
385800	388800	You might as well.
388800	389800	Actually.
389800	394000	I never met a retired person.
394000	398680	In today's content-driven society, even my grandpa has an OnlyFans.
398680	400200	Oh shit.
400200	402600	Oh shit, what's that like?
402600	404600	He does his lawn work shirtless.
404600	410280	He does it for free, you can just go see him do it.
411280	416280	It's just like a lemonade stand box, but it says OnlyFans.
416280	422280	Well he doesn't want people who aren't fans giving him money, that'd be weird.
422280	424280	Yeah he doesn't accept charity.
424280	425280	Like a true American.
425280	430280	It's a generational thing, yeah.
430280	434280	That upholds the Christian values I know this show espouses.
434280	435280	That's exactly right.
435280	439280	We were telling Becca before we started that we're the only Christian Delta Green podcast.
440280	442280	And I said praise Jesus.
442280	443280	More or less true.
443280	444280	Thank God.
444280	449280	I was going to try and save you all, but here you are already saved, doing the Lord's work.
449280	457280	That's exactly right, which is why I've called this scenario Holy Cow Farms.
457280	459280	And we're playing Delta Green.
459280	465280	We're playing the game that we play, which is our version of Delta Green.
465280	471280	We explained it to Becca in a short condensed version right before we got on this call.
471280	475280	We've explained it to you occasionally on this podcast as well.
475280	476280	Once or twice.
476280	477280	Once or twice.
477280	478280	Here and there.
478280	483280	The best RPG players and dungeon masters I've ever met will always look straight to Cameron
483280	487280	and say, this is a homebrewed rule.
489280	490280	For the no one else.
490280	493280	Well we like to play it by the book, rules as written.
493280	494280	That's right.
494280	495280	And that's what we'll be doing tonight.
495280	498280	And we get really mad if you break a rule or do something wrong.
498280	499280	That's right.
499280	501280	And if you call us out on it online, you're wrong.
501280	502280	You're wrong.
502280	503280	You're wrong.
503280	507280	Yeah, we will mobilize our armory of Tweetbots.
507280	508280	Two stars.
508280	510280	They don't follow the rules.
510280	511280	Too political.
511280	513280	Way too much Jesus.
514280	517280	Yeah, we got a pretty sick two star review the other day.
517280	521280	It was great because nothing in it was wrong.
524280	525280	That's the best kind of review.
525280	528280	Yeah, it was like, okay, this is not for this person.
528280	529280	That's all fair enough.
529280	532280	They described our podcast very accurately.
533280	538280	I like that Thomas said, well, they had to give it up for the quality of the show, even
538280	542280	though they disagree with our politics and give us that second star.
542280	545280	Well, they listen all the way through, so kudos.
546280	551280	So let's get into Holy Cow Farms.
551280	556280	We see a stale room lit by fluorescent lighting.
556280	560280	It is filled with chairs and a long aisle that goes down the middle.
560280	563280	There are people scattered about.
563280	569280	It's a decent crowd, but not anything that the speaker would text a picture of the crowd
569280	571280	to their mom that's not overcrowded.
572280	573280	Anyone else?
573280	574280	Anyone else?
574280	577280	Text pictures of crowds to your mom to brag.
578280	580280	Hey mom, look where I am.
582280	584280	You'll never be here, you bitch.
585280	588280	Oh no, different mom.
588280	590280	Because of your agoraphobia.
593280	599280	Above in big letters, it says City Science, City Science Conference.
599280	603280	City Science Society presents the City Science Conference.
603280	605280	20,002.
605280	607280	20,002.
607280	608280	Damn.
608280	610280	And standing at the podium, what do we see, Joe?
610280	617280	You see a guy who is wearing a tweed coat with a button down and a sweater vest
617280	621280	and he's got well-kempt hair and he's pretty fit
621280	624280	and he is addressing the crowd at a podium there.
624280	630280	Yes, and I can confirm that this is indeed a significant find.
630280	633280	The workers were able to break through the ground there
633280	637280	and they were smart and to immediately notify me
637280	641280	and I went over to take a look and it was, in fact...
641280	644280	And you click over to the next slide on your presentation?
644280	645280	This.
649280	653280	It's a chunk of stone with some writing on it
653280	655280	but it's not writing that is familiar to anyone.
655280	656280	It looks significant.
657280	661280	And we do believe, I do believe, that you will be reading about this find
661280	663280	in your history books from here on out.
663280	666280	It's the first of its kind and it does prove, in fact,
666280	669280	that there is a civilization that was once here and long forgotten.
669280	672280	Now it will take some time to get more facts to you
672280	674280	but at this time I can confirm it has been found.
674280	677280	Everyone stands, whooping applause.
677280	679280	Yeah! Rocks!
679280	681280	Well, that's a find.
684280	688280	And as someone says, that's a find, in the audience
688280	694280	we cut to a hotel room, seemingly above where this conference is taking place
694280	699280	sometime later as we see this same dignified academic.
699280	704280	The person who you are with is a large, squat woman
704280	708280	who is in her late 20s
708280	711280	and she has a broken nose.
711280	713280	It's like off to the side.
713280	718280	One of her eyes is looking up at you as the other one stares at the blank TV
718280	720280	as she's sitting at the foot of this bed.
720280	724280	He's a little more disheveled now and there's empty gin bottles
724280	726280	on the table in the hotel room there.
726280	728280	He says,
728280	734280	I guess I did the thing you wanted, right? Are we done?
734280	737280	You did an excellent job, Shelly.
737280	745280	And I deeply appreciate you handling it with a certain amount of grace and aplomb.
745280	751280	It's very kind and nice and I think that we're going to work well together, do you agree?
751280	755280	Of course! I do your job for me.
755280	760280	She gives you a knowing look that's kind of a hint of confidence
760280	767280	and assuredness in herself, but also just a foreknowledge of what saying yes to this life means.
767280	770280	And she kind of nods and says,
770280	774280	Alright, well, don't feel like a fish, you know?
774280	781280	It's not any way to live, but hide away your pain, I suppose, if you want to.
781280	784280	Do you know how many friends I've taken aside and said,
784280	786280	don't feel like a fish?
790280	796280	I just don't want you to be flopping around on one of these hotel beds one of these days.
796280	799280	No, I'm fine. Just celebrating is done.
799280	803280	She nods again, heads out the door. As the door closes, we see...
803280	807280	You said that the magazine pizza come out when?
809280	815280	She slams the door on your drunk ass and with the door slamming on it,
815280	818280	a text across reads, 20 years ago.
819280	825280	The same door opens up, but we see different people inside an identical room.
825280	828280	Luke, what does your guy look like?
828280	834280	Vincenti Boro. Bori. Something.
839280	842280	I mean, now's the time to choose.
842280	846280	I had to check and from over here, it is an I. Bori.
847280	853280	Just average height, but very skinny, wiry man with slick back, greased back hair,
853280	858280	kind of eyes that are a little too big for his head, kind of slightly bugged out.
858280	862280	And he's wearing a very, very nice three piece suit,
862280	868280	just black with like little hints of red accents and white undershirt,
868280	870280	very well dressed and manicured.
870280	877280	And this very nicely dressed and manicured man is standing next to the same woman
877280	879280	that we saw in the previous room.
879280	885280	And she's got one eye on you and her other eye is planted firmly on the person
885280	890280	who is laying down in the bed with a pillow over their face.
890280	897280	And as she pulls the trigger on the gun and red begins to expand out slowly
897280	904280	from the top of the pillow, we cut back to Vincent Bori living his life in his home.
904280	905280	What does that look like?
905280	906280	What does that look like?
906280	910280	Vincent is cleaning up after his grandkids that are running around,
910280	914280	making a mess in his very, very nice apartment.
914280	919280	And once the mess is all cleaned up, fast forwards, the sun goes down,
919280	923280	it's nighttime and he's looking up at the stars through his telescope.
923280	927280	As you look up through the telescope and into the stars or the other way around.
927280	929280	The stars are looking at me.
930280	936280	You're looking at a particular set of stars.
936280	939280	They've really taken your attention.
942280	944280	Damn, nice stars.
944280	946280	Look at them stars.
946280	950280	And they begin to move.
950280	955280	Slowly at first, one of them just darts down to the bottom left of your view.
955280	958280	Another one jumps from that area up to the top right.
959280	962280	What the fuck is going on up there?
962280	966280	And he gets out a pen and paper and starts furiously taking notes.
966280	967280	And as you're taking notes.
967280	969280	And just as the stars are moving.
971280	973280	Good notes.
973280	978280	We cut to a picture of the notes as you're scribbling them.
978280	982280	You've got different stars and then you start connecting all of these dots.
982280	988280	And it makes your classic five pointed star with a circle all the way around it.
988280	991280	And on the inside there are a couple stars.
991280	994280	And you're not sure what to make of just two stars in the middle.
994280	995280	But that's what it is.
995280	999280	After he connects all those he looks at it and he snaps a pic on his phone.
999280	1003280	And starts sending it out and reverse Google image searching.
1003280	1004280	2002.
1004280	1006280	Even earlier maybe.
1006280	1009280	He flips his phone open.
1009280	1010280	And not even.
1010280	1012280	Unfortunately nope.
1013280	1014280	You could have a digital camera.
1014280	1015280	Even a decent one.
1015280	1018280	And then you take out the SD and upload it to your computer.
1018280	1021280	He starts writing letters.
1021280	1023280	With a drawing in it.
1023280	1024280	With an ink pen.
1024280	1026280	With a quill ink pen.
1026280	1028280	Oh like he'd use.
1030280	1033280	He's replicating the image.
1033280	1036280	And he's going to do some research on scientists.
1036280	1040280	We cut to a montage of you at different colleges.
1040280	1041280	You in libraries.
1041280	1044280	And then eventually we.
1044280	1049280	Somehow all of this knowledge brings you to this point in this hotel room.
1049280	1053280	And as she pulls the trigger with one eye on you.
1053280	1059280	Well I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.
1059280	1061280	You're quite welcome.
1061280	1064280	You know I could have done that without the noise and the blood.
1064280	1066280	But yeah yeah I appreciate you too.
1066280	1071280	I just wanted to show you here at the top that you know.
1071280	1073280	I'm not unwilling to join in.
1073280	1075280	Get my hands dirty okay.
1075280	1079280	I'm not going to be one of those aloof handlers.
1079280	1080280	Who's just you know.
1080280	1083280	Not able to handle any of your business.
1083280	1085280	Because they're too busy with their own shit.
1085280	1086280	I want to be.
1086280	1087280	I want to be helpful.
1087280	1088280	I want to be good.
1088280	1089280	Do you?
1089280	1090280	Right.
1090280	1093280	Well in my family it's all back scratches.
1093280	1097280	She scratches your back.
1097280	1098280	And I scratch hers.
1098280	1099280	Alright.
1099280	1101280	In my family we don't hug.
1101280	1102280	We don't shake hands.
1102280	1104280	So that's what people mean when they say that.
1104280	1107280	It's all back scratches.
1107280	1110280	And as the backs are being scratched.
1110280	1111280	We go.
1111280	1115280	The camera goes deep into the textiles of the shirt.
1115280	1119280	That Vincenti Bori is wearing.
1119280	1122280	And through on the other side we see a jungle.
1122280	1125280	The bottom that says ten years ago.
1125280	1129280	And then over the top like you do in a movie.
1129280	1133280	The characters walk over the camera into view away.
1133280	1135280	And we see a squad.
1135280	1140280	We see a team of archaeologists with equipment.
1140280	1144280	And there's a security personnel squad as well.
1144280	1147280	Who is at the lead of that security squad?
1147280	1149280	Jimmy Corrigan.
1149280	1151280	And what does Jimmy Corrigan look like?
1151280	1155280	Jimmy Corrigan is about six foot two though ten years ago.
1155280	1157280	Can you talk soft louder?
1157280	1158280	He has a high and tight haircut.
1158280	1159280	Yeah there it is baby.
1159280	1162280	I'm going to have to abandon this voice.
1162280	1165280	He has a high and tight haircut at pretty much all times.
1165280	1170280	And ten years from now it's going to be a little less up top.
1170280	1172280	I'm not just doing Luke's voice am I?
1172280	1173280	I don't think so.
1173280	1177280	I haven't done the voice enough to have really established one.
1177280	1180280	I think he's leading this column straight out of a
1180280	1182280	it looks like a Jurassic Park team or some shit right?
1182280	1183280	Yeah absolutely.
1183280	1187280	And he like holds a hand up to bring everybody to a stop.
1187280	1193280	It's completely silent except for.
1193280	1197280	Skeet, skeet.
1197280	1202280	Just normal jungle noises.
1202280	1205280	Tree sounds, tree sounds.
1206280	1213280	And up to the right of you we all see a man who has frozen
1213280	1217280	but he's done so in just like an extravagantly dramatic way.
1217280	1219280	He's dressed.
1219280	1221280	He is I promise.
1221280	1224280	I fucking guarantee you.
1224280	1226280	It's a Christian podcast.
1226280	1228280	Unfortunately.
1228280	1231280	He's a tall wiry man in his late twenties.
1231280	1235280	He's got a short beard and hands stained with dirt.
1235280	1239280	He's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots.
1239280	1244280	He's got a well worn backpack and a faded grey brown cowboy hat.
1244280	1250280	And the tip of his shovel kind of glints and gives you a ding
1250280	1254280	to show the sharpness at the tip of the shovel.
1254280	1256280	I turn back and I look at, Joe what's your character's name?
1256280	1258280	It's Shelley St. Blythe.
1258280	1260280	Shelley you know when he's standing there like that
1260280	1265280	I just can't help but feel like he's just got a lot more like magnetism and charisma.
1265280	1267280	It's weird.
1267280	1269280	I hope that's not an odd thing to say.
1269280	1272280	Shelley's dabbing himself with a hanky.
1272280	1275280	Oh yeah no if you like that sort of thing sure.
1275280	1278280	No I don't. I really don't. I just think the general public.
1278280	1282280	After you were drinking you kind of told me about how he gets the articles.
1282280	1284280	And I'm just saying I think that's why.
1284280	1286280	That used to be me god damn it.
1286280	1288280	I know maybe just be a little more.
1288280	1290280	Oh man if you could keep it down.
1290280	1296280	Dr. Brock Hargrave says as he takes off his hat, his cowboy hat,
1296280	1300280	holds it to his chest and gives you the most earnest look you've ever seen.
1300280	1302280	How do you keep all that hair under there?
1302280	1306280	It falls out luxuriously.
1306280	1311280	And we are here to, we got to say thank you to Nathan in Texas
1311280	1316280	who is a patron at the $10 or up level on patreon.com slash pretending pod
1316280	1319280	who made Dr. Brock Hargrave.
1319280	1320280	Thank you.
1320280	1321280	Thank you very much.
1321280	1324280	Thanks for making him so handsome with that sharp shovel.
1324280	1330280	Oh absolute sharp shoveler this guy and Nathan big thank you.
1330280	1333280	Okay so Dr. Brock Hargrave is kind of giving you the looks
1333280	1336280	and then he looks back and looks at everyone and he says,
1336280	1340280	crew, I think I found it.
1340280	1347280	And he shoves his digging tool into the, he thrusts it into the ground.
1347280	1348280	Sorry.
1348280	1349280	Thank you.
1349280	1352280	Good stop.
1352280	1357280	He puts his, he jumps, he jumps on the, he starts to shovel.
1357280	1359280	He shoves his shovel.
1359280	1360280	He shoves his shovel.
1360280	1361280	He shoves it hard.
1361280	1365280	And he fucks the earth.
1366280	1367280	Metaphorically speaking.
1367280	1370280	With his dick-like shovel.
1370280	1371280	The head on that shovel.
1371280	1373280	Open the virgin earth.
1373280	1375280	Jesus Christ.
1375280	1379280	And with that, yeah, you don't hear the traditional, you know,
1379280	1382280	ground jungle floor noise as he puts it in.
1382280	1384280	And there's a bing, bing.
1384280	1393280	And as he twists the shovel, one of the trees behind him moves.
1393280	1394280	That's what I'm talking about.
1394280	1396280	Like that is fantastic.
1396280	1397280	I got to give it up for that.
1397280	1398280	God damn it.
1398280	1399280	That was incredible.
1399280	1402280	As impressive as that was, Dr. Hargrave,
1402280	1404280	you really got to get down from there.
1404280	1408280	The big cats are out at this time of the evening.
1408280	1410280	Where we are.
1414280	1416280	I think that was just one of the babies,
1416280	1419280	but that means the mama is sure to be close.
1420280	1426280	And you hear a rumble, like a great big meow,
1426280	1431280	coming from inside the clearing that this tree has made.
1438280	1439280	God damn it.
1439280	1442280	I'm going to have to kill a majestic beast of the untamed wilds
1442280	1445280	because Dr. Hargrave couldn't wait until the morning.
1445280	1446280	It's Hargrave.
1447280	1450280	And as the crew walks through this opening,
1450280	1453280	you see a temple that is in ruin.
1453280	1455280	And you see columns.
1455280	1461280	And you see a massive statue of a jungle cannon.
1467280	1469280	And it groans again.
1469280	1472280	Dr. Hargrave, you better get back from there.
1472280	1477280	And I cautiously approach the statue with my rifle pointed at it.
1477280	1479280	It is a statue.
1479280	1481280	And you approach it with your rifle.
1481280	1486280	Dr. Brock Hargrave is sneaking up on his hands and knees up next to you.
1486280	1488280	What an impish way to do that.
1488280	1492280	There's a plaque written in some strange language
1492280	1495280	at the base, the pedestal of the statue.
1495280	1499280	He is unrolling this piece of parchment
1499280	1505280	and with a crayon begins rubbing out of the corner of my eye.
1505280	1507280	I see that and I think, cool.
1507280	1509280	This guy has his own parchment.
1509280	1516280	We cut to the entire escort, the entire crew of this archaeological dig
1516280	1519280	running for your lives.
1519280	1522280	As you make your way out of this tree clearing,
1522280	1524280	the tree falls behind you.
1524280	1526280	Dr. Hargrave, what the hell is that thing?
1526280	1529280	I don't know.
1529280	1533280	As he stuffs this kind of manuscript back into his backpack
1533280	1534280	as you guys are running.
1534280	1536280	St. Blythe is lagging behind,
1536280	1539280	but he's able to kind of stumble his way up to Corrigan.
1539280	1541280	Corrigan.
1541280	1543280	We're paying you to keep us safe.
1543280	1545280	You must keep us safe.
1545280	1548280	I fucking thought I was going to keep you safe from wild animals or poachers.
1548280	1550280	I didn't know what the fuck that was.
1550280	1552280	I've never seen anything like that in my life.
1552280	1559280	We cut back to you guys in an airplane hangar in a different country,
1559280	1562280	and this woman walks up to you.
1562280	1564280	She's quite fit.
1564280	1567280	Shelly, you actually recognize the broken nose
1567280	1573280	and wandering eye of the handler you had met 10 years ago as she approaches.
1573280	1576280	Jimmy, is it?
1576280	1579280	Yeah, Sergeant James Corrigan, retired.
1579280	1585280	Appreciate your silence moving forward on what you saw back there, yeah?
1585280	1586280	He nods.
1586280	1587280	May I ask why?
1587280	1590280	Do you think that the world is ready to see that?
1590280	1593280	He thinks about his wife, whom he loves,
1593280	1595280	and his two newborn babies.
1595280	1596280	Nice pond.
1596280	1597280	Yeah.
1597280	1601280	Really, at this point, it's a great pond.
1601280	1603280	And he kind of shudders, and he says, no, ma'am.
1603280	1610280	Well, then I'd say, do you want to maybe join us again one day if duty calls?
1610280	1612280	He nods and extends his hand.
1612280	1615280	As the hands shake, we cut away.
1615280	1617280	What's this woman's deal, though?
1617280	1621280	Why does she sound 80 in everything?
1621280	1624280	I was laughing when you first started doing it.
1624280	1626280	Is it Jennifer Jason Leigh from Annihilation?
1626280	1627280	Yes!
1627280	1628280	Okay.
1628280	1629280	Well done.
1629280	1634280	Well, I mean, I wouldn't have gotten that if I hadn't just watched it with you.
1634280	1635280	Just watched it with me?
1635280	1636280	Yeah.
1636280	1638280	Great film.
1638280	1642280	Also, I was thinking of using a character like her for the other campaign.
1642280	1644280	She's such a good character, and now she's mine.
1644280	1645280	Yep.
1645280	1648280	All right.
1648280	1654280	And as the hands shake, we do that wild, old-school Batman transition
1654280	1661280	where the entire screen's still going.
1661280	1668280	And it says, June 25th, 2022, 10 days ago.
1668280	1676280	And the camera pans up on an old Victorian home that has seen much, much better times.
1676280	1680280	It sits just outside of the city.
1680280	1686280	And after it says June 25th, 10 days ago, comma, or no, underneath it, nice.
1686280	1688280	Good formatting.
1688280	1694280	It says...
1694280	1698280	The best filmmakers like to storyboard live.
1698280	1700280	What does it say in Becca Scott?
1700280	1703280	It says, The Hold.
1703280	1704280	The Hold?
1704280	1711280	This dump of a house has boards crisscrossed over every window,
1711280	1716280	spray paint covering most of the exterior walls saying,
1716280	1720280	Keep out and hobos will kill you in here.
1720280	1728280	And other things people would definitely spray paint on the outside of this abandoned house
1728280	1733280	that is obviously holding some derelicts.
1733280	1738280	You know, the dregs of society, but a family to one another.
1738280	1744280	First, we peer into a bedroom window on the second floor,
1744280	1751280	and it's got the dirtiest bear mattress you've ever seen lying on the ground,
1751280	1757280	newspapers taped up to every wall, red strings attaching them,
1757280	1762280	but then sort of like a ball of string never really finished its initial job.
1762280	1767280	Somebody just decided to get really stoned in the middle of whatever they were working on.
1767280	1774280	A lot of unfinished projects, but a lot of things left to be uncovered in this room
1774280	1778280	as you see a ladder hit against the window sill,
1778280	1785280	and a mess of wiry black hair peeps up over the side.
1785280	1788280	Hey fish face, you in here?
1788280	1790280	Uh, yeah.
1790280	1795280	Laughter
1795280	1797280	Check out my score.
1797280	1804280	The army surplus green rucksack she always carries lands in the living room
1804280	1809280	before she slings the leg over the sill and you see this tiny bit of a woman.
1809280	1811280	Meat hook.
1811280	1815280	Emeline Meat Hook Pennyworth, but just known by Meat Hook,
1815280	1821280	is gaunt and thin, pale skin, beady, darting eyes,
1821280	1826280	always sizing up every wall of the room, every exit before stepping into it
1826280	1831280	with kind of squirrel-like movements and doesn't trust nobody.
1831280	1835280	Wowie zowie, Meat Hook. That's quite the take.
1835280	1841280	Yeah, look at all this top ramen. I scored like 20, 30 packs. You see this?
1841280	1845280	This is the good shit I'm telling you, fish face. We're gonna eat like kings.
1845280	1848280	Oh, we're gonna be full to our gillyworths.
1848280	1851280	That's right, just like we always say, full to the gillyworths.
1851280	1853280	You know something, fish face?
1853280	1854280	What's that?
1854280	1857280	Even though it's never gonna work out romantically between us
1857280	1859280	and we've made that very clear.
1859280	1861280	That makes sense.
1861280	1863280	You're the only person I can trust.
1863280	1866280	Cause you're too dumb to ever lie to me.
1866280	1868280	That's enough for me.
1868280	1877280	Me too, buddy. Me too. Here, crunch some of this up.
1877280	1882280	She just bites into a brick of dry ramen and passes it his way.
1882280	1886280	He pours out some of the powder and does a quick line.
1886280	1888280	Line of what?
1888280	1890280	Oh, fish face, of seasoning.
1890280	1891280	The ramen seasoning.
1891280	1893280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1893280	1896280	I like it when it gets all up into my nasal packages
1896280	1899280	and then I can only taste this shrimp lime for a week.
1899280	1902280	You're weird as fuck, fish face, but I like it.
1902280	1905280	Are you reassessing the romantic?
1905280	1906280	He's a little freak.
1906280	1910280	No, not like that. I told you, not like that. Shut up and eat your ramen.
1910280	1912280	Becca, when you were describing your character,
1912280	1914280	I was thinking the whole time like,
1914280	1921280	oh, this is what a professional role player sounds like.
1921280	1924280	She even got her name right on the first try.
1924280	1926280	That's a pro. That's a pro.
1926280	1929280	That's called reading from the notes.
1929280	1930280	Oh my God.
1930280	1932280	We ought to give that a shot sometime.
1932280	1935280	I tried it. I got to Dr. Brock.
1935280	1939280	All right, if I could get an alertness check from Meat Hook.
1939280	1941280	Heck yeah. First check of the game.
1941280	1942280	First check of the game.
1942280	1944280	First check of the game.
1944280	1949280	Alertness. Okay, I got a 50. Let's see.
1949280	1952280	That's a fail. 75.
1952280	1955280	From behind you, without you even noticing,
1955280	1959280	which I mean immediately puts the hairs on the back of your neck
1959280	1966280	at the opposite of ease, you hear a woman's voice from behind you.
1966280	1969280	I saw that was quite a grab there.
1969280	1972280	She stands up quick and flips out her butterfly knife
1972280	1977280	and does a four point flip maneuver.
1977280	1978280	Who the freak are you?
1978280	1982280	That's some pretty impressive moves there, Emmeline.
1982280	1985280	I appreciate you being about your wits.
1985280	1991280	She steps forward menacingly and says, the name's Meat Hook.
1991280	1993280	Meat Hook it is.
1993280	1999280	Then she pulls open her bottom lip and there's a tattoo of like, you know,
1999280	2002280	of Meat Hooks.
2002280	2004280	Of Meat Hook.
2004280	2006280	Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.
2006280	2007280	The entire text.
2007280	2010280	Yeah, yeah.
2010280	2015280	Real small, like one of those rice art things.
2015280	2020280	Which in tattoo form inside the mouth is never going to be legible.
2020280	2024280	Really impressive though for a stick and poke.
2024280	2027280	Especially since Fish Hook did it.
2027280	2029280	He can't even spell good.
2029280	2030280	Fish face?
2030280	2033280	Yes.
2033280	2039280	With one eye on Meat Hook and the other eye on her fishy little friend,
2039280	2040280	who's a human.
2040280	2042280	I'll just say that since we're playing Delta Green.
2042280	2045280	I'm imagining a full on fish.
2045280	2047280	She is looking at you.
2047280	2053280	Her nose is extremely crooked off to one side and this woman is gaunt.
2053280	2057280	This woman is skin and bones.
2057280	2060280	You think dripping wet.
2060280	2062280	She wouldn't even weigh two stone.
2062280	2063280	What's two stone?
2063280	2064280	Not a lot.
2064280	2065280	You should know before you say it.
2065280	2066280	Forty pounds?
2066280	2067280	Oh, not even forty pounds.
2067280	2068280	That's not good at all.
2068280	2069280	Not even four stone.
2069280	2070280	Maybe four stone.
2070280	2074280	This is a three year old.
2074280	2076280	Somebody feed this kid.
2076280	2078280	Your handler has Benjamin buttoned.
2078280	2082280	No, but she has seemingly shrunk.
2082280	2085280	She is extremely, extremely gaunt.
2085280	2094280	And Meat Hook, my name is Esther or Ruth or Solomon or Lazarus,
2094280	2096280	whatever you need it to be right now.
2096280	2098280	I guess you can call me Esther.
2098280	2102280	A lot of people got a lot of names in this house so it's not so weird.
2102280	2103280	Exactly.
2103280	2104280	You're used to it.
2104280	2107280	And what else you're used to is putting your life on the line for things
2107280	2108280	that matter.
2108280	2109280	Is that right?
2109280	2112280	How do you know that about me?
2112280	2117280	Nobody looks at me and knows that I do good stuff.
2117280	2121280	Fish face like looking longingly in the corner.
2121280	2122280	I see.
2122280	2123280	I see you.
2123280	2127280	Shut up, fish face.
2127280	2128280	Yes, ma'am.
2128280	2133280	Becca, what is something that someone could know if they'd been watching
2133280	2136280	Meat Hook for some time, but no one in the house would know,
2136280	2139280	something that you keep a secret?
2139280	2144280	Oh, then no one in the house knows.
2144280	2150280	She likes to appear in the window at a children's afterschool program
2150280	2155280	and watch them finger paint because she never got to have that one-on-one
2155280	2158280	personal attention when she was a kid.
2158280	2159280	That's sad.
2159280	2160280	Damn.
2160280	2161280	Wow.
2161280	2165280	I know more than, oh nope, did the fish.
2165280	2168280	What do you know, fish face?
2168280	2170280	Little combo there.
2170280	2176280	I know more than you think you might think that I might know about you.
2176280	2180280	Nobody knows more than they think I might know about them.
2180280	2184280	I think you'd be surprised if you were to know how much that I know about
2184280	2187280	what you think I don't know that I know about you,
2187280	2193280	which is that I know that you stand outside that window every Thursday
2193280	2197280	afternoon right at finger painting time.
2197280	2202280	That's what I know.
2202280	2203280	How the fuck do you know that?
2203280	2205280	I know a lot and I can help.
2205280	2207280	You're going to get me some finger paints?
2207280	2212280	I got all the paint I need and I point to a whole collection of graffiti
2212280	2214280	can spray paints.
2214280	2220280	I don't need nothing from no skinny one-eyed broken nose freak.
2220280	2222280	Whoa, that's not nice.
2222280	2230280	What do you think that I can give?
2230280	2234280	Because I think you'd be surprised once again at what I can offer.
2234280	2236280	What do you want here at the hold?
2236280	2238280	What's your biggest dream?
2238280	2240280	You know, we've been working for a while.
2240280	2243280	We're trying to bring down the man in a lot of ways.
2243280	2245280	We're starting a revolution.
2245280	2248280	We want people to know what's out there,
2248280	2252280	that the government is run by lizard people.
2252280	2261280	As true as that may be,
2261280	2264280	we got to take it one bite at a time on our way to the top.
2264280	2269280	And I've got a job that needs skills with your persuasion.
2269280	2275280	I could help the hold, whether it's providing more ramen,
2275280	2278280	that way you don't have to make as many runs like you do,
2278280	2282280	or whether it's putting our sights on something big,
2282280	2284280	maybe you got your hopes up for.
2284280	2288280	Well, I guess we could use running water in the hold.
2288280	2291280	That's within your capability.
2291280	2298280	Also, ramen, I heard you could get ramen where the noodles are soft.
2298280	2302280	I've heard tell.
2302280	2306280	Only seen it through a window.
2306280	2308280	How soft do you want them?
2308280	2310280	How soft do you want them?
2310280	2317280	I want it to mush in, to dissipate.
2317280	2320280	As soon as I touch it, it's so soft.
2320280	2322280	I'll give you a mouthfeel, girl.
2322280	2326280	And you got to deal with it.
2326280	2330280	You got to deal with it.
2330280	2334280	I'm in.
2334280	2338280	The people that I'm bringing to this aren't going to want you in here.
2338280	2341280	I'm just telling you right now.
2341280	2342280	I'm used to that.
2342280	2344280	Someone just watched Andor.
2344280	2347280	It's just based on the character that you made.
2347280	2349280	It's just those patches on your jacket there.
2349280	2351280	What do you mean the character I made?
2351280	2355280	I'm just, you know, it's the choices you made with your life.
2355280	2358280	As we look down and see the outfit I forgot to describe.
2358280	2363280	Which is a ripped, white ribbed tank.
2363280	2365280	Stained and dirty.
2365280	2366280	Black ripped jeans.
2366280	2370280	And of course, never leaves the house without her leather jacket.
2370280	2373280	Covered in studs with a big anarchy A on back.
2373280	2375280	You were noticing my patches?
2375280	2381280	Yeah, why don't you give us a rundown on some of those?
2381280	2386280	The Lizards Are Here is obviously prominently featured on front.
2386280	2388280	Let's see, I got this one.
2388280	2393280	It says fluoride is making your teeth fall out.
2393280	2394280	That one's true too.
2394280	2398280	Ask me for more info.
2398280	2399280	That's a big one.
2399280	2400280	Yeah.
2400280	2401280	That's huge.
2401280	2402280	What else?
2402280	2407280	You know, milk isn't just for kids.
2407280	2409280	I made that one myself.
2409280	2411280	I'm not sure where I'm going with it.
2411280	2414280	I like that one best, personally.
2414280	2416280	Here's the deal.
2416280	2425280	This job, it's about getting some of this information out about some of these alternative things.
2425280	2430280	These three other agents that I'm bringing in on this job.
2430280	2434280	They're all about keeping all of this business under wraps.
2434280	2436280	Keeping it hidden from the world.
2436280	2439280	I need you to be on that side of things for just this one mission.
2439280	2443280	You can keep spouting off your rhetoric, however you see fit outside.
2443280	2450280	This should only take, you know, one, maybe four sessions.
2450280	2454280	When you say sessions.
2454280	2456280	Okay, Esther, no.
2456280	2458280	That's where I gotta say no.
2458280	2463280	If there's one thing I can't do, it's put the kaput on.
2463280	2465280	I'm not a kaputter putter oner.
2465280	2468280	I'm not a kaputter taker offer, you know what I mean?
2468280	2471280	I unveil the truth.
2471280	2473280	What, do you want to blow the top off, kid?
2473280	2475280	All of it. I don't even know yet.
2475280	2476280	Look at this article.
2476280	2481280	It says governor unveils new nuclear power plant.
2481280	2483280	You think that's all that's in that building?
2483280	2484280	I've broken in.
2484280	2488280	Well, I couldn't get into a lot of the locked doors, but I'm going to find out more.
2488280	2490280	Look at this article.
2490280	2494280	I did find this guy with a fish head.
2494280	2500280	He just goes around the room pointing at normal, everyday announcements for the public
2500280	2504280	and strings leading to nowhere yet again.
2504280	2507280	One day I'll put it all together. I know there's a big master plan.
2507280	2516280	Well, you may not be wrong about that either, but now I appreciate your, you know,
2516280	2521280	the story arc that you're on saying no to this right off the bat, but...
2521280	2530280	How do we turn that smile upside down?
2530280	2531280	All right.
2531280	2533280	That's one of her patches.
2533280	2541280	If I keep my mouth shut and I help you with your thing, not only will you get running water for the whole of the hold.
2541280	2542280	That's right.
2542280	2544280	Can you get me a soft ramen?
2544280	2545280	That's right.
2545280	2547280	And finger painting?
2547280	2548280	Finger painting too.
2548280	2554280	And any more information on any of these flipping through some of these articles, these dead ends,
2554280	2557280	I can give you a through street.
2557280	2559280	You got yourself a deal, Esther.
2559280	2563280	She puts out a feeble bony hand in your direction.
2563280	2566280	I crush it with my handshake.
2566280	2570280	Can I unarmed combat her?
2570280	2571280	Hell yeah.
2571280	2573280	Yeah, you can.
2573280	2574280	Oh yeah.
2574280	2575280	That's a 40.
2575280	2576280	We got it.
2576280	2578280	That beats the 30 that I rolled.
2578280	2584280	And so go ahead and roll a D4 minus one.
2584280	2587280	That's a three, including the minus one.
2587280	2594280	Three is a lot.
2594280	2595280	I'm really sorry.
2595280	2604280	As you crunch the bone in her hand, she begins to faint and hits the ground.
2604280	2607280	Fish face, catch her.
2607280	2614280	Fish face slides underneath, making a moist palette for her limp body to fall on.
2614280	2622280	Quick, spit on that ramen to make a pillow.
2622280	2626280	And with that, we cut to.
2626280	2630280	You've all been invited to a Bible study.
2630280	2633280	Oh no.
2633280	2642280	You know that it is an invitation to an operation due to the nature of the invitation.
2642280	2648280	It is delivered by email from watchingthestreetatgmail.com.
2648280	2658280	It says that you are invited to a Bible study on Tuesday, July 5, 2022 at 8 Oak Avenue at 8.36 p.m.
2659280	2667280	Shelley finds his in his bar cart that is an intricate carved globe that opens up at the halfway mark at the hemisphere.
2667280	2672280	Is there a computer inside of it?
2672280	2674280	No, it's just nice glasses.
2674280	2681280	And there's an envelope sitting there because that's where they know that he'll always find their missives.
2681280	2682280	It's an email.
2682280	2684280	Yeah, he said it was an email.
2685280	2691280	I was wondering why the computer thing happened.
2691280	2695280	Jimmy doesn't check his email and doesn't find his and doesn't go on this operation.
2695280	2698280	Well, I guess none of us find the invitation.
2698280	2701280	This has been another short story.
2701280	2704280	Thank you so much for joining us.
2704280	2710280	It went straight to the spam filter and countless lies were lost.
2711280	2715280	Yeah, Shelley's butler printed it out for him.
2715280	2718280	That's the name of his dog.
2718280	2723280	We need to arrive. We need to arrive at this house.
2723280	2726280	So who gets there first?
2726280	2729280	Would anyone scope out the place before?
2729280	2730280	Oh, you know.
2730280	2731280	Yeah, I kind of thought.
2731280	2734280	Good hook be scoping.
2734280	2739280	Okay, so I was at the library naturally because Esther told me, look out for an email.
2739280	2742280	And I said, cool, I'll make an email address.
2742280	2744280	Awesome.
2744280	2746280	What's that?
2746280	2748280	Oh.
2748280	2750280	What's the A with the circle around it?
2750280	2756280	The UFOs are right above you at yahoo.com.
2756280	2759280	Perfect.
2759280	2761280	So this is a Bible study.
2761280	2763280	It ate oak av.
2763280	2766280	I know these streets of the city.
2766280	2767280	Avenue is spelled out.
2767280	2772280	There's no oak av like the back of my hand and I go by sewer to get there.
2772280	2775280	Nice.
2775280	2776280	Awesome.
2776280	2784280	So we see a street with a house on it that has, it's a ranch style house.
2784280	2790280	Two car garage has a basketball hoop concreted in next to the driveway.
2790280	2796280	And the landscaping at one time was well done, but has very much gone to shit.
2796280	2801280	It hasn't been mowed in weeks and it's July.
2801280	2807280	And you pop your head out of one of these little drainage ditches on the side of the
2807280	2811280	road with direct eye contact with the front of this house.
2811280	2817280	And you see a foreclosure sign is in the yard of eight oak avenue.
2817280	2819280	Avenue spelled all the way out in all of your emails.
2819280	2823280	There's a Jeep parked across the street and it's been there for a couple hours.
2823280	2830280	And Jimmy Corrigan sees this like urchin pop her head out of the, uh, out of the sewer
2830280	2832280	and gets suddenly like, thanks.
2832280	2833280	Maybe the perimeter has been compromised.
2833280	2838280	Doesn't know what's going on, but he's swivels his binoculars from his house to a
2838280	2840280	meat hook.
2840280	2847280	You see meat hook roll struggle out of the drainage hole, roll down the street and then
2847280	2852280	pull out a can of spray paint from her bag and just spray paint an X in the middle of
2852280	2857280	the street and then kiss it for good luck.
2857280	2862280	Who is rolling up as this middle of the street is being spray painted as meat hook is popping
2862280	2866280	out of the sewer, Vincent or Vincent.
2866280	2870280	The rats in this city are getting even fucking worse.
2870280	2876280	Do another lap around and we'll make sure everything's good and you can drop me off.
2876280	2877280	No problem, boss.
2877280	2878280	Okay.
2878280	2879280	Of course.
2879280	2880280	Of course I will.
2880280	2881280	Nailed it.
2881280	2882280	Thanks Joe.
2882280	2887280	Thanks Goomba.
2887280	2889280	Shelly St Blythe.
2889280	2894280	Shelly shows up in a, uh, it's a nice town car from like the nineties.
2894280	2897280	It would have been gorgeous when it was bought new.
2897280	2901280	Now it's looking a little raggedy and he's pulling up and uh, he sees Jimmy and they
2901280	2903280	kind of make eye contact.
2903280	2904280	Jimmy like shoes.
2904280	2906280	You're like shoes.
2906280	2909280	He's like, no, no, no, no, no.
2910280	2911280	Jimmy?
2911280	2912280	Jimmy, is that you?
2912280	2913280	God dammit.
2913280	2920280	Uh, meat hook, uh, you are hearing this, uh, this Jimmy call.
2920280	2925280	I walk over and I slam on the hood of his Jeep.
2925280	2926280	What are you doing here?
2926280	2927280	You live here?
2927280	2928280	What the fuck, kid?
2928280	2930280	What are you doing here?
2930280	2931280	What am I doing here?
2931280	2932280	I was told to be here.
2932280	2934280	Were you told to be here?
2934280	2937280	I was told to be here, but I drove here in my sensible vehicle.
2937280	2940280	I didn't take the sewers like a fucking turtle.
2941280	2946280	Oh, so you got things to say about my mode of transportation.
2946280	2955280	We don't all have a fancy four wheeled vehicle, like two motorcycles with the house in the middle.
2957280	2961280	Jimmy gets a, gets a flash of recognition and he's like, wait a minute.
2962280	2970280	Every third Thursday when I pick my kids up from finger painting, I see them out there.
2970280	2974280	I show him a picture of the kids and I'm like, you probably see them with Barbara, my estranged wife.
2974280	2979280	First of all, you shouldn't show strange people that crawl out of the sewer pictures of your kids.
2979280	2980280	Second of all.
2982280	2983280	First things first.
2983280	2985280	They're just on my mind a lot, you know, lately.
2985280	2987280	I never seen your Barbara.
2987280	2989280	I never seen your kids.
2989280	2992280	I never seen a single finger paint in my life.
2994280	2996280	You must be thinking of some other trash lady.
2999280	3006280	At that time, uh, Vincenty is, walks up, he like pulls a cigarette out of his, uh, cigarette case and taps it and lights it up.
3006280	3010280	He's like, well, I never seen nobody look like a fucking rat like you.
3010280	3011280	Okay.
3012280	3014280	You just beat up on me today.
3014280	3015280	What is this?
3015280	3016280	What are you doing here?
3016280	3017280	Who are you?
3017280	3018280	You look fancy.
3018280	3020280	Are those, uh, spats on your shoes?
3020280	3023280	You know what a spat is, but you don't know what cars are.
3027280	3029280	I didn't say I didn't know what it was.
3029280	3031280	I just said I didn't have access.
3031280	3032280	I didn't have the means.
3032280	3034280	Do you want to start smoking?
3034280	3035280	Do you smoke cigarettes?
3035280	3037280	Do you want to start smoking?
3038280	3042280	Usually just butts I pick up off the ground, but yeah, I'll take a freshie.
3042280	3043280	Here you go.
3043280	3045280	He gives her a fresh cigarette.
3045280	3050280	This is the part of our Christian podcast where we introduce like an obvious moral dilemma.
3054280	3055280	Do you smoke?
3055280	3057280	Do you want to start smoking?
3057280	3060280	Hey, Meat Hook, do you want to start smoking?
3060280	3064280	He gives her a couple of cigarettes and lights one for her.
3064280	3066280	And then he looks over.
3066280	3069280	He's like, Oh, you're the, you're the crystal doctor.
3069280	3070280	Oh yeah.
3070280	3071280	Shelly St. Blythe.
3071280	3072280	You know me.
3072280	3073280	Yeah.
3073280	3074280	Yeah.
3074280	3080280	You never returned my letters when I was asking about the sky stuff, but you're more of an
3080280	3081280	earth guy.
3081280	3082280	The star crystals.
3082280	3083280	Yes.
3083280	3084280	I remember.
3084280	3085280	Yeah.
3085280	3088280	We can talk about this once we get into our mission, but I got lots.
3088280	3090280	I got your brain, your whole brain.
3090280	3091280	I'm going to pick it.
3091280	3094280	Oh, and not in the way that I usually pick people's brains.
3094280	3097280	Oh, sounds ominous.
3097280	3103280	Like, you know, and he starts walking into the house.
3103280	3105280	She says, are you a surgeon?
3105280	3106280	He's just walking away.
3106280	3107280	In a way kid.
3107280	3109280	I fear that that man is not a surgeon.
3109280	3113280	The door opens as some of you approach.
3113280	3120280	You see a woman that you've seen before, uh, looking at two of you at a time, nose crooked,
3120280	3123280	crinkled off to the side this time.
3123280	3128280	However, she is just extremely gone.
3128280	3129280	So small.
3129280	3131280	I mean, maybe four stone.
3131280	3132280	Hey, what happened to your hand?
3132280	3137280	You've doubled in size.
3137280	3139280	You look bigger than me.
3139280	3140280	You look good.
3140280	3141280	All right.
3141280	3142280	Thank you.
3142280	3143280	Get in.
3143280	3144280	Esther.
3144280	3145280	It's Ruth.
3145280	3146280	Ruth.
3146280	3147280	How are you?
3147280	3150280	Oh, it's, it's Rachel and Lazarus, whichever, whichever.
3150280	3151280	Come on in.
3151280	3152280	Come on in.
3152280	3157280	And as you guys walk into this house, immediately you're hit with a stench of cat piss, like
3157280	3160800	thorough, thorough cat piss.
3160800	3168920	Just like that horrible, horrible acidic smell is just climbing up into your nostrils, stinging
3168920	3170240	your eyes.
3170240	3175160	And this house matches when it comes to whether it's clean or not.
3175160	3179800	Cause it's not, it's super, super gross.
3179800	3183320	And she says, how about we go with Moses on this one?
3183320	3184320	All right.
3184320	3190360	Now you'll see that I've been busy and you see papers, maps everywhere, circles, numbers,
3190360	3192040	dates all around.
3192040	3198600	You see she's written Holy cow farms on one of these maps and she kind of points at it
3198600	3200120	and she's like, this is your mission.
3200120	3201120	Okay.
3201120	3202120	Dr. Brock Hargrave.
3202120	3204000	Oh, God damn it.
3204000	3206040	Do you remember him?
3206040	3207440	Yes, I'm familiar.
3207440	3208440	Jimmy here.
3208960	3213680	Jimmy, uh, first of all, the scent of the cat piss and then the mention of that name,
3213680	3220720	he is having horrifying images of the, oh yeah, of the cat statue, slain half an archeological
3220720	3221720	team.
3221720	3222720	Yes, that's right.
3222720	3223720	Whoa.
3223720	3224720	Are you all right, man?
3224720	3225880	I didn't mean to be so rude about your kids.
3225880	3226880	I'm sorry.
3226880	3227880	You can't afford a car.
3227880	3228880	Thanks.
3228880	3230880	You look shook though.
3230880	3236600	You never smelled cat piss before?
3236600	3237600	Not like this.
3237600	3238600	Well, once.
3238600	3239600	Real grip.
3239600	3242840	Listen kid, I pray you never smell cat piss like this.
3242840	3246640	Honestly, this is a step up from my place.
3246640	3250560	Oh, right.
3250560	3252560	You live in the sewer or something?
3252560	3256760	You hear a dishwasher and meat hook is like, what is that?
3256760	3258000	I got a 19.
3258000	3259000	I'm fine.
3259000	3264360	Taj Mahal over here.
3264360	3268640	Years of practicing that tense situations and suppressing his own emotions come to his
3268640	3271720	service and he just pushes it down to his toes.
3271720	3276200	And with that, you're able to kind of give a quick glance around as you hold your grip
3276200	3277200	on reality.
3277200	3283400	You glance around, you notice that just within this small room and kind of the rooms around
3283400	3284400	you, you don't see a cat.
3284400	3285640	You don't see any cat toys.
3285640	3289120	You don't see a litter box, um, nothing to that.
3289120	3290120	All right.
3290120	3291120	So, um, all right.
3291120	3295520	I guess, uh, and she goes to the table and is like, I guess we'll, we'll talk here.
3295520	3300800	And she just shoves all of these papers off of the table onto the ground and puts that
3300800	3306600	map down that she, uh, takes off all these pins, uh, from it off the wall, slams it down.
3306600	3307600	It says, Holy cow farm.
3307600	3315080	She's like, this is, this is where, um, Dr. Brock Hargrave has been working and, uh, he
3315080	3316080	went missing.
3316080	3319200	One of his coworkers also went missing, you know, he's on the list.
3319200	3320240	We need to find him.
3320240	3322360	We need to figure out what happened.
3322360	3324440	What's this list of yours.
3324440	3326200	What's your interest in this guy?
3326200	3334360	He was after something that we were looking into and he, uh, clearly maybe fell prey to
3334360	3335360	the vector.
3335360	3340120	But, um, that's why we're sending in you is to figure out what happened.
3340120	3341120	The vector.
3341120	3342120	Yeah.
3342120	3348320	Vector is the word that we use sometimes to describe an unnatural incursion, like, like
3348320	3354960	what you saw and looks at you too, like what you saw and looks at meat hook.
3354960	3356440	Like what you know is real.
3356440	3362360	I was born knowing I don't have to see nothing to know what people think is real.
3362360	3363760	That's not what's really real.
3363760	3364760	Ruth.
3364760	3369880	You're telling me this kid has never experienced the mythos and you're bringing her in on something
3369880	3370880	like this.
3370880	3372600	This kid has skills that you need.
3372600	3373600	Okay.
3373600	3376120	I just parkour, try and climb up the wall.
3377120	3378120	All right.
3378120	3379120	Roll.
3379120	3380120	Okay.
3380120	3387760	That's a 3,250.
3387760	3389040	On top of the fridge.
3389040	3395160	You see me, holy fuck.
3395160	3396160	This kid's good.
3396160	3397160	Is this a vector?
3397160	3400160	I am the vector.
3400200	3407440	That's what I'm saying is that, you know, she, uh, she seems to have skills that may
3407440	3409400	come into some play here.
3409400	3413280	So I'm not denying her skills, but nobody knows what's going to happen to their mind
3413280	3416120	when they get exposed to, to the truth.
3416120	3421100	That's kind of the best part of the whole thing is that meat hook here already kind
3421100	3423380	of believes the truth.
3423380	3427360	Believe in what you see on the internet and seeing in real life are two different things.
3427360	3432080	There's no way this kid has the internet.
3432080	3435240	That's a, that's a trenchant point.
3435240	3436240	Look at you.
3436240	3444800	But there's a library down the street and then like, well, several sewer streets away.
3444800	3448800	I'm thinking this kid might have a place in my moon rock store after this.
3448800	3449800	Your moon rock store.
3449800	3450800	Moon rock store.
3450800	3451800	We'll see.
3452440	3457480	We got to prove yourself, but you can climb like crazy and I need a climb.
3457480	3458480	You need a climber.
3458480	3459480	Are you serious?
3459480	3463080	No one's ever given me a legit job before because of the smell.
3463080	3465440	Well I smoked too many cigarettes to smell anything.
3465440	3466440	So okay.
3466440	3474840	I never thought I'd say this, but I, I think I have a good initial first impression of
3474840	3476760	you.
3476760	3479120	Likewise kid.
3479120	3483900	Now let's go to the stinky shit cow farm.
3483900	3486800	And you see that it's actually the map where it's circled.
3486800	3492040	It is in a business district and it is just an office building.
3492040	3493040	Damn.
3493040	3496480	Ruth, do you know the sewers around here?
3496480	3498040	Around all the cow farms?
3498040	3499040	I'm sorry.
3499040	3500040	Meat hook.
3500040	3501040	Meat hook.
3501040	3504720	How could you confuse the name meat hook for Ruth?
3505560	3506560	Look at this tattoo.
3506560	3510720	It's admittedly, it's admittedly an incredibly difficult mistake to make.
3510720	3513160	Do I look like a Ruth to you?
3513160	3515840	She holds out her lip.
3515840	3518800	Oh, is that the entire text of weapons and clears the jungle?
3518800	3521200	How did you know?
3521200	3522200	In stick and poke?
3522200	3523600	No one's ever guessed that before.
3523600	3524600	I love that book.
3524600	3526000	I've, I've got it memorized.
3526000	3531360	I would recognize that anywhere, but that must have taken weeks.
3531360	3536760	You know, it's like a 700 page book, so we're still working on it, but, uh, we at least
3536760	3542240	got the prologue, my boy fish face.
3542240	3544840	He's a good start.
3544840	3549840	Fish face pokes his head in and he's like, yeah, he's been following fish face.
3549840	3551240	I told you I'm striking out on my own.
3551240	3552760	You can't come on this mission.
3552760	3553760	Sorry.
3553760	3557080	He'll be here if we need him.
3557080	3562040	If you ever call for him, he's, he's home.
3562040	3567880	Ruth you're telling me these two urchins who are so obviously in love, one of whom has
3567880	3571720	just gotten the first and legitimate employment opportunity of her life.
3571720	3574960	You're going to send them out untested on an operation.
3574960	3576100	We're not meant to be together.
3576100	3577800	I know it seems that way.
3577800	3580800	I know it looks like we're very compatible.
3580800	3581800	It didn't work out.
3581800	3583800	I don't want to get into details.
3583800	3584800	Fish face knows.
3584800	3586080	No, I'm cool with it.
3586080	3587080	Okay.
3587080	3590800	See, I think that this is going to be fine for these exact reasons.
3590800	3593760	Um, he does, he seems like he's cool with it.
3593760	3595760	Yeah, I'm cool with it.
3595760	3598080	I guess it's okay if she dies.
3598080	3599080	Yeah.
3599080	3606800	Ruth, Moses, whatever kind of looks at you with just kind of a nod that I can die.
3606800	3607800	What?
3607800	3615600	Hey kid, if you keep up the climbing around crawling like a little, little rat child,
3615620	3616620	you're going to survive.
3616620	3617620	Fine.
3617620	3618980	And if all else fails, get behind Jimmy.
3618980	3620200	That's always been my plan.
3620200	3622320	You get behind the doctor getting behind me.
3622320	3623320	Oh, that Jimmy.
3623320	3624320	Sorry.
3624320	3626920	Uh, Vincenze really looks like a Jimmy.
3626920	3627920	He does.
3627920	3628920	Yeah.
3628920	3630920	I've heard it all my life.
3630920	3632920	All right.
3632920	3634920	Well, uh, I'm pretty quick.
3634920	3636320	Thanks for noticing.
3636320	3637320	What's the game plan?
3637320	3639040	Well, do they know we're coming?
3639040	3644440	Uh, no, I mean we can, we can, she kind of points to an area in the corner where there's
3644440	3648400	some like a laminator and a printer.
3648400	3654600	And she's like, I can dolly up some, whatever kind of ID you want here, uh, to get into
3654600	3655600	the building.
3655600	3660520	If you, if you want to start there or, uh, you guys can just go break into his house
3660520	3667000	or you, you know, I mean, whichever one you feel, why don't you get those credentials
3667000	3668920	ready while we break into his house?
3668920	3670480	The missing doctor's house.
3670480	3671480	Okay.
3671480	3672480	That's interesting.
3672520	3674920	I mean, that's why you're here, right?
3674920	3679040	But did he go missing from Holy cow farms or did he go missing from his home?
3679040	3680040	Okay.
3680040	3681520	So one of them went missing at work.
3681520	3687320	The coworker went missing at work, but Dr. Brock Hargrave left that same day and then
3687320	3688320	didn't come back in.
3688320	3693680	So coworker never clocked out and Dr. Hargrave left and never came back.
3693680	3695880	Sounds like Hargrave killed his friend.
3695880	3696880	Yeah.
3696880	3697880	It sounds a lot like that.
3697880	3698880	Doesn't it?
3698880	3699880	But for what?
3699880	3700880	It's always money.
3701280	3709040	If I know anything about crime scenes, uh, which I mean, why would I, uh, but maybe we
3709040	3716280	should try to get some evidence at the holy cow farms and then present it to the doctor,
3716280	3717840	uh, in order to take him in.
3717840	3722360	You're going to show the evidence of how he killed his friend to him, right.
3722360	3724360	To make him turn himself in.
3724360	3729200	Maybe not turn himself in, but have some sort of mental break and we can nab him then.
3729520	3733320	Yeah, we could put on a play where we recreate what happens.
3733320	3735040	So he's forced to confess out of guilt.
3735040	3738920	I can put on quite a play with my puppets.
3738920	3739920	I'm sorry.
3739920	3740920	You're what?
3740920	3741920	You're what?
3741920	3743520	My puppets, of course.
3743520	3745160	I can put on a puppet play.
3745160	3751920	Okay fancy man, you got puppets on you?
3751920	3752920	Thank you.
3752920	3753920	You've noticed.
3753920	3755440	And he kind of straightens his jacket.
3755440	3757960	Those were in your jacket the whole time?
3757960	3758960	Doc.
3759720	3760720	Yes.
3760720	3761720	This one here.
3761720	3762720	This is.
3762720	3763720	Who's that?
3763720	3764720	This is Craig.
3764720	3765720	Mile.
3765720	3766720	Craig Mile.
3766720	3767720	What is Craig Mile?
3767720	3768720	Craig Mile.
3768720	3769720	Craig Mile.
3769720	3770720	Craig Mile.
3770720	3771720	What does Craig Mile look like?
3771720	3772720	He's one of my actors.
3772720	3778280	He's got a long nose and makeup around the eyes and his hair's yarn.
3778280	3785640	Doc, how many times do I have to tell you we can only pack essentials on missions?
3785760	3788360	Craig Mile is essential.
3788360	3796200	He makes the puppet look up at him at St. Blythe and then look away and then look back.
3796200	3797520	No, he was joking.
3797520	3798800	You of course are essential.
3798800	3801600	Okay Craig Mile, I've got some questions for you.
3801600	3804040	Yes, of course.
3804040	3805340	You can talk to Craig Mile.
3805340	3806960	She gets all up in his face.
3806960	3811760	Tell me the last thing you heard about a doctor named Brock.
3811760	3813520	Oh, Brock?
3813960	3815920	Shelly St. Blythe is doing his voice.
3815920	3818320	Oh, Brock, that asshole?
3818320	3822000	The guy who thinks he can just walk into a place and all of a sudden he's the talk of
3822000	3823000	the town?
3823000	3824160	That he can just discover things?
3824160	3825400	Like he points at a thing.
3825400	3826480	Oh, he discovered it?
3826480	3827480	That kind of guy?
3827480	3829480	Oh, he gets my blood boiling.
3829480	3831480	He knew how to twist the thing, Doc.
3831480	3838480	Craig, I see the value of your puppet friend getting to your inner psychology very easily.
3838480	3842600	No, no, yes.
3843120	3846720	Jimmy knows about my history with Hargrave.
3846720	3849040	He does my job better than me sometimes.
3849040	3855640	Flashback to Jimmy opening one of his go bags and finding a puppet of himself.
3855640	3863240	It's called Mean Jimmy and he's clearly confiscated a bunch of smaller puppets.
3863240	3871560	Yeah, I know about your relationship with Hargrave and the puppets.
3871560	3873520	Is that going to be an issue on this operation?
3873520	3874520	What?
3874520	3875520	I don't believe so.
3875520	3877560	Pray to God it won't be.
3877560	3886800	As useful as this puppet thing seems immediately, we're going to have to find some evidence
3886800	3890420	so that the puppet show can go.
3890420	3894820	So that there's some verisimilitude to the play that I produce, yes.
3894820	3898880	This whole sewer thing, how does, are they all connected?
3898880	3900360	How do we use those?
3901240	3903040	I don't think you're sewer people.
3903040	3909760	We should probably go in that fancy, you know, limousine thing you got outside.
3909760	3912160	It's a sensible suburban vehicle.
3912160	3916880	Vincenti did come in a stretch escalated.
3916880	3925200	My eyes can't even comprehend that that is a thing that you could get into.
3925200	3931920	As long as we don't have to take any turns and it's a straight shot there, we can drive
3931920	3933200	it.
3933200	3937680	It does appear to be, but from the map, just a straight shot, but it still seems risky.
3937680	3940240	That one turn at the end is going to get you.
3940240	3943720	We can, hey, we can jump out and walk a part of the way if we need.
3943720	3946960	I don't like doing it, but I walk 30,000 steps a day.
3946960	3948760	It seems impractical.
3948760	3950640	I'll page Goomba, my driver.
3950640	3953660	Oh, I thought that was the purple guy from McDonald's.
3953660	3954660	That's grimace.
3954660	3959940	Anyway, no, Goomba is not a big purple monster.
3959940	3964100	He is my driver and a decent friend of mine.
3964100	3965780	Got it.
3965780	3972940	As impractical as it might be, I think, um, we should take the giant Escalade limousine
3972940	3978240	cause I never ridden in, honestly, like only ridden in a car maybe twice in my life.
3978240	3979820	You deserve that Escalade kid.
3979820	3984840	I'll be following, uh, the convoy and also comprising the only other vehicle in the convoy
3984840	3985840	in my Jeep.
3985840	3987320	So we're going stealth.
3987320	3988320	Yeah.
4009820	4025760	Some constellation.
4025760	4032560	I was thinking this.
4032560	4039400	I am now mechanization.
4129400	4152660	If I lose it on a Wednesday, it'll be cause I was afraid, you'll say it's all just metaphor.
4242660	4264420	Uh, we did it.
4264420	4265420	We did it.
4265420	4266420	We did an episode.
4266420	4267420	Well shit.
4267420	4268420	Holy shit.
4268420	4269420	Easy peasy.
4269420	4270420	We can get going.
4270420	4271420	Easy peasy.
4271420	4272420	Hell yeah.
4272420	4273180	Easy peasy.
