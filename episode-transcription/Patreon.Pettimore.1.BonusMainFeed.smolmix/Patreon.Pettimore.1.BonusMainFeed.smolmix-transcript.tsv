0	6360	Hello, good friends of the podcast called Pretending To Be People.
6360	13760	It is the wolf, the dog, w-wolf the dog, with a special announcement this fine morn-vening.
13760	20040	You may have noticed that this here episode is not episode 26 of season 2.
20040	23880	In fact, it ain't even part of this here campaign.
23880	29280	We'll be back in a couple weeks to pick up where we left off with the very precarious
29280	33520	situations we last left Julius Beck and Cal.
33520	44360	But for now, it's a b-b-b-b-bonus episode from over on P-P-P-P-P-P-Patreon.
44360	51600	In this premium, exclusive content from our contention-confidential feed is the episode
51600	59320	one of a six-part series that Thomas has entitled, The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
59320	66600	That's right, Thomas is the GM, and he's running a story set in the holler outside of contention
66600	71200	following the events of season one of Pretending To Be People.
71200	77480	So if you haven't listened to season one, my delectable listeners, now is the time to
77480	84200	go back to where it all started, because there's, uh, spoilers and such in this ish.
84200	90280	Now if you have listened through season one, then boy oh boy, you are ready for what we've
90280	98080	been calling the Oops All Pettymores campaign, because Joe, Luke, and Zatch are all playing
98080	104280	members of the extended Pettymore family, and let me tell y'all the what, it's been
104280	107080	so got darn fun.
107080	114640	Just five dollars over at patreon.com slash pretending pod will unlock the saga that follows,
114640	119000	as well as the 30-something bonus episodes that came before.
119000	126240	Now I'm not saying you need the bonus content, but I am saying that if you did need all this
126240	133320	bonus content, it's just five bucks to get what you need, and fittingly, Wolf is here
133320	141080	to provide an all-new, all-banging theme, provided by one of Joe's dad's bands.
141080	163200	It's the Morels with Get What You Need.
163240	164280	I need a boat.
164280	165440	I need a plane.
165440	166440	I need a car.
166440	167440	I need a train.
167440	168440	I need a pill.
168440	169440	I need a drink.
169440	170440	I need a smoke.
170440	171440	I need a drink.
171440	176440	I need an eight-foot couch and a four-foot screen.
176440	180440	A big vacation and a dog that's mean.
180440	185440	I need a four-wheel drive and a three-piece suit.
185440	189440	A nine-millimeter that I know I can shoot.
189680	193680	In the USA, it's not a question of greed.
193680	197680	Cause everybody who is anybody agrees.
197680	201680	For followers the ones who lead.
201680	205680	You get what you need.
210680	211680	Brad's Monkey.
211680	212680	Are you ready?
212680	213680	I'm ready.
213680	216680	Five, four, three, two.
216680	218680	Brad's Monkey!
218920	220920	The Funky Monkey!
220920	222920	Brad's Monkey Monkey!
222920	224920	The Funky Monkey!
224920	226920	Blam!
226920	230920	Welcome to the Danov Show!
230920	233920	Welcome to the Danov Show!
233920	240920	For episode 39 of the Patreon, which is a very fucking special episode.
240920	242920	Is it not, Luke?
242920	243920	It is.
243920	247920	The title of this one is, remind me, Thomas?
248160	249160	The Hunt.
249160	250160	No.
252160	256160	The Lost Treasure of John Lee Treasuremore.
256160	259160	The Lost Treasure of John Lee Treasuremore.
259160	261160	The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
261160	264160	Episode 1, Bad Blood.
264160	271160	Where we will be all playing Pettymore cousins or uncles or brothers or whatever it is.
271160	273160	You're all cousins to somebody.
273160	276160	The working title in all of my notes is Oops All Pettymores.
276400	277400	Oops All Pettymores.
277400	278400	Exactly.
278400	283400	So I think the Pettymores cousins are going to go on a treasure hunt.
283400	290400	But see, it's Thomas' job now, thank God, it's not my job for this one.
290400	296400	It's Thomas' job to make it serious and call episodes bad blood.
296400	299400	And it's up to us to say, Oops All Pettymores!
299400	305400	Well, I did want to say, while tonight we'll be searching for treasure, you can find treasure,
305640	309640	especially for the holiday season, at Target.
309640	311640	Target is the best destination for treasure.
311640	312640	That bit hasn't come out yet.
312640	313640	It hasn't come out yet.
313640	314640	You're right, this is a sneak peek.
314640	316640	It's a preview bit.
316640	317640	And it's real too.
317640	320640	So guys, go shop at Target.
320640	322640	That is what you get here in the Dennis Inn.
322640	327640	That's a bit from an episode we recorded yesterday, last night.
327640	330640	So it's some pretty fresh stuff for you.
330640	331640	Some pretty hot sauce.
331640	332640	Bleeding edge.
332880	335880	Right off the lips of Luke.
335880	337880	We asked for some sins in the chat.
337880	340880	And I saw one that, it's already scrolled past now, but I had to mention it.
340880	343880	I think it was Zach said, that's a different Zach.
343880	344880	What did I say?
344880	345880	A different Zach.
345880	347880	Zach with a K.
347880	350880	Said that he accidentally put laxative in his boss's coffee.
350880	354880	I think that might take a week.
354880	355880	Whoa!
355880	356880	Accidentally?
356880	358880	What were they putting in their box's coffee?
358880	361880	An accident isn't a sin unless you don't apologize.
362120	365120	What if you don't need to apologize?
365120	367120	Like this one?
367120	370120	Because what's he going to do?
370120	371120	Apologize?
371120	372120	You make fun of him.
372120	374120	There's a lot to take into account here.
374120	376120	How much does your boss hate shitting?
376120	379120	How much do you need your job?
379120	382120	How much do you personally value honesty as an individual?
382120	385120	How much is that going to eat you up?
385120	389120	Are you the kind of person who, if you know you have to lie to your boss
389120	391120	about the fact that you made him shit his pants?
391360	393360	Every day for the rest of your life until you die
393360	395360	because there won't be retirement for us.
395360	396360	Exactly.
396360	398360	Is that going to fuck with you?
398360	403360	One day you guys are sharing what the worst thing that ever happened to you was
403360	408360	and he was like, it was probably that time I shit my pants at work.
408360	410360	What about you?
410360	412360	That's when you tell him.
412360	416360	Honestly, it was the day that I accidentally gave you laxative
416360	420360	and then I saw you shit your pants at work.
420600	423600	So if that would eat you up, just get it over with.
423600	425600	Get it over with?
425600	427600	Were there any other good...
427600	429600	I was setting this up.
429600	432600	I read the Brad's Monkey thing and then I kind of missed all of it.
432600	434600	There's somebody talking about that they found this cheap beer
434600	436600	called Montucky Cold Snacks
436600	438600	and just the name alone makes me want to taste it.
438600	440600	Have you not had it?
440600	444600	Totoro's Bang Bus has been recruiting people for a year
444600	447600	to drink it because it makes really good Brad's Monkeys.
447840	449840	Brad's Monkey.
449840	451840	That funky monkey.
451840	457840	Montucky Cold Snacks is well distributed here in our hometown of Springfield, Missouri.
457840	459840	I feel like it's at every bar.
459840	461840	Every bar?
461840	463840	Is it in a grocery store where I've seen the cans before?
463840	465840	I don't go to that section.
465840	468840	It's like blue with a horse on it.
468840	470840	I haven't seen it, I don't think.
470840	472840	It looks like a retro NBA jersey.
472840	474840	I'll pick some up next time.
474840	476840	It does.
477080	479080	What else?
479080	482080	It looks like if they made Outrun Horse Show.
482080	484080	Uh huh.
484080	486080	What's an Outrun Horse Show?
486080	488080	Come on down!
488080	490080	See if you can outrun this horse!
490080	492080	No, it's like Knight Rider, but a horse.
492080	494080	The horse always wins.
494080	496080	Yeah, every time!
496080	498080	Who's faster than a horse?
498080	500080	It's Knight Rider, but it's a talking horse.
500080	502080	Back in the day, they used to do
502080	504080	radio plays that had Superman
504080	506080	racing the Flash
506320	508320	And what I understand, Superman always won
508320	510320	and I always think that that sucks because
510320	512320	he does all the other things
512320	514320	The Flash has one thing and it's to be fast
514320	516320	And he's still not the best.
516320	518320	And if he loses to Superman, that's just sad.
518320	520320	That's such a bummer for him.
520320	522320	Man, if you had that kind of power, wouldn't you become
522320	524320	I don't know, an authoritarian fascist
524320	526320	or just indifferent?
526320	528320	That might be interesting to explore.
528320	530320	That kind of Superman.
530320	532320	Has anybody ever done a bad Superman?
532320	534320	Who would try to put him down like some sort of
534320	536320	opposite?
536320	538320	It's probably going to have to be another group of
538320	540320	pretty shrewdly realized superhero
540320	542320	parodies.
542320	544320	No, Rorschach's not pretty.
544320	546320	Wait, what?
546320	548320	Who are we talking about?
548320	550320	Well, a number of different IPs.
550320	552320	What was that recent one that came out, Bright Something?
552320	554320	Bright?
554320	556320	Where he's a kid?
556320	558320	It was not great, but I liked it.
558320	560320	I haven't seen it, but I remember the whole thing was that
560320	562320	it was bad Superman.
562320	564320	Oh, Hancock.
564320	566320	No.
566320	568320	Yes.
568320	570320	Yeah.
570320	572320	He's right, Joe.
572320	574320	That's hilarious. Brightburn.
574320	576320	Brightburn.
576320	578320	I liked it.
578320	580320	Because it's like, oh, Superman, he's bad,
580320	582320	but what are you going to do?
582320	584320	Evil.
584320	586320	He's a kid and he's bad.
586320	588320	Oh, and he can do crazy stuff.
588320	590320	What are you going to do?
590320	592320	Brightburn.
592320	594320	Yeah, I've got Brightburn.
594320	596320	I'm sorry to hear that, dude.
596320	598320	What are they going to do, though?
598320	600320	You're a kid.
600320	602320	It Brightburns when I pee.
602320	604320	What do we do?
604320	606320	Like, neon.
606320	608320	What are you asking?
608320	610320	What do we do?
610320	612320	What do we do?
612320	614320	Yeah, what do we do to get the fire back
614320	616320	within our loins?
616320	618320	They've got pills for that.
618320	620320	An uncle.
620320	622320	LMFAO. Put it on right now.
622320	624320	Loins burning.
624320	626320	It's strange.
626320	628320	They're not that far apart
628320	630320	in age. It's not that weird.
630320	632320	Thomas. Yeah.
632320	634320	Almost ready. I'm ready.
634320	636320	I'm rearing to go.
636320	638320	I'm ready to play a pettymore
638320	640320	for the nth time.
640320	642320	I've never played a pettymore.
642320	644320	Are you excited? Yeah.
644320	646320	How do you get into the mindset of playing a pettymore?
646320	648320	It's a page-long introduction.
648320	650320	Yeah, I saw how long it was.
650320	652320	You wouldn't let me read it, though.
652320	654320	No, of course not.
654320	656320	Of course not. There's secrets in here
656320	658320	that I don't think you can handle.
658320	660320	I've got my intro in mind, but
660320	662320	unless the story reads it, I think I should go first
662320	664320	so that the more thought-out ones
664320	666320	can go after me.
666320	668320	Yeah, that's why you're going to go second
668320	670320	after Zach.
670320	672320	Actually, we might sandwich Zach.
672320	674320	Luke can go first.
674320	676320	Joe, you told me you literally had dreams
676320	678320	about rehearsing yours.
678320	680320	It's not a page-long, is all.
680320	682320	Okay, Luke can go first
682320	684320	and give Zach time to write his.
684320	686320	I'm just looking up the questions you sent.
686320	688320	I don't know if you're
688320	690320	trying to be me as vengeance
690320	692320	or if we are the same person.
694320	696320	Look on me, look on me.
696320	698320	If it's vengeance, I get it. If it's just you,
698320	700320	then...
700320	702320	Welcome to my life.
702320	704320	Did you get it?
704320	706320	Is that how we're kicking off?
706320	708320	Are we kicking off with all of this?
708320	710320	No, there's some stuff.
710320	712320	Should we get some good intro stuff
712320	714320	about the episode for the Patreon?
714320	716320	Let's get some intro stuff about the episode
716320	718320	for the Patreon.
718320	720320	For them audio listeners.
720320	722320	Hello audio listeners.
722320	724320	Hello audio listeners.
724320	726320	You guys have missed so much
726320	728320	that we talked about before
728320	730320	in the Patreon.
730320	732320	So go ahead and up those Patreons.
732320	734320	Did you know Chris D'Elia died?
734320	736320	I saw that, dude.
738320	740320	We didn't talk about that on the stream, did we?
740320	742320	No, you gotta explain why you said that
742320	744320	though, because
744320	746320	Joe's over here scrolling
746320	748320	on his phone.
748320	750320	I got the update, I got the CNN update
750320	752320	that Kirstie Alley had passed away
752320	754320	and I said that aloud.
754320	756320	And I really loudly was like
756320	758320	aww.
758320	760320	Which confused Zach.
760320	762320	Because I thought he said that Chris D'Elia died
762320	764320	and then Thomas goes, aww,
764320	766320	oh no.
766320	768320	But like genuinely?
768320	770320	Like someone you cared about
770320	772320	or like cared that they died
772320	774320	and died? Well, you know, when I was younger
774320	776320	I watched that pervert episode of Workaholics
776320	778320	all the time before I went to bed.
778320	780320	No, I did watch Cheers like all the time
780320	782320	because it was just on like the nightbox
782320	784320	as I was going
784320	786320	to bed as a young one.
786320	788320	I'm going to rip Kirstie Alley
788320	790320	who will be long dead and decayed
790320	792320	by the time you hear this episode edited
792320	794320	as a Patreon listener.
794320	796320	Okay, so what we're doing here tonight
796320	798320	is episode one
798320	800320	of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
800320	802320	It's called Bad Blood.
802320	804320	Bad Blood.
804320	806320	Cause baby now we got
806320	808320	bad blood.
808320	810320	And everybody made me mad.
810320	812320	Got it.
812320	814320	Check.
814320	816320	Nailed it. Nailed it.
816320	818320	And what this is is a
818320	820320	an oops all Pettymore arc where
820320	822320	all the boys are going to be playing
822320	824320	family members of
824320	826320	my character John Lee Pettymore
826320	828320	from season one. And we kind of
828320	830320	established during that season that he has a very big
830320	832320	extended family who are
832320	834320	kind of as crazy and wild as him.
834320	836320	Big old wild family out there in contention.
836320	838320	Big old blunts. In the surrounding
838320	840320	areas. Huge
840320	842320	smoking big doinks in Amish.
842320	844320	Big smoking big doinks
844320	846320	in contention.
846320	848320	But we won't be in contention listeners
848320	850320	because some of you might remember
850320	852320	what happened at the end of season one.
852320	854320	Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers.
854320	856320	Which is Keith put a big old dome over everything.
856320	860320	And I
860320	862320	after seeing
862320	864320	the beautifully round shape
864320	866320	off riding into the sunset
866320	868320	of Planet Juggernaut
868320	870320	he looked at that shape and said
870320	872320	I like that.
872320	874320	Now you know it has deeper roots than that right?
874320	876320	Oh. I thought you did this
876320	878320	intentionally but I don't know.
878320	880320	I was like damn I respect the fuck out of
880320	882320	Luke when I listen to like episode
882320	884320	15 or 16 and
884320	886320	Keith literally says like I'd like to
886320	888320	put a giant
888320	890320	dome over the whole city.
890320	892320	I think it's just something
892320	894320	I think about a lot.
894320	896320	That's just the Luke
896320	898320	preoccupation that you brought into
898320	900320	the character.
900320	902320	Which is a great
902320	904320	no it's the who shot Mr. Burns episode.
904320	906320	Oh. Did they do it in the movie too?
906320	908320	I think they did. It was like the whole
908320	910320	point of the movie.
910320	912320	Oh they do a dome in the movie who shot
912320	914320	Mr. Burns he just builds a giant thing
914320	916320	that blocks out the sun.
916320	918320	If you want to block out
918320	920320	any one of us your three sons
920320	922320	during this episode you can put up your hand
922320	924320	like that in a particular way
924320	926320	in front of that camera that can block
926320	928320	one of us from sight. Yeah.
928320	930320	That's me. I'm gone now.
930320	932320	I was trying to block you all.
932320	934320	That's all of us.
934320	936320	Okay my three sons.
936320	938320	You're all going to be playing Betty Morris.
940320	942320	I cannot wait.
942320	944320	And times are a little tough for the
944320	946320	Betty Morris.
946320	948320	They are not at their full power as you might say.
948320	950320	You all are friends of
950320	952320	Jon in the way that cousins
952320	954320	often are. Some of you
954320	956320	are a little older. One of you is
956320	958320	pretty much right at Jon's age.
958320	960320	But he's been missing for a year at this point.
960320	962320	He's not the only
962320	964320	anymore missing.
964320	966320	Don D. Pettymore is gone.
966320	968320	Jimmy Sanders is gone.
968320	970320	There's some talk about
970320	972320	Aloysius
972320	974320	and Edward. Some sort
974320	976320	of foul play that might have happened involving
976320	978320	Jon but nobody really knows. You've only
978320	980320	heard rumors. And
980320	982320	when you were all growing up you would come
982320	984320	to Pettymore Holler at least
984320	986320	every year if you didn't actually
986320	988320	live there for the big family cookout.
988320	990320	A huge Pettymore reunion.
990320	992320	And it's been five or six years since
992320	994320	that's actually been put on.
994320	996320	But this year everybody gets
996320	998320	a call or an email
998320	1000320	or a handwritten note from Ma
1000320	1002320	Pettymore, the family matriarch.
1002320	1004320	We can work
1004320	1006320	out family trees and stuff later.
1006320	1008320	I think even though some of you are older
1008320	1010320	it's plausible you're all
1010320	1012320	within the same generation of cousins
1012320	1014320	of Jon. So we're going to say
1014320	1016320	she's your great-great-grandmother.
1016320	1018320	We have them young. Yeah, she's like
1018320	1020320	67.
1020320	1022320	Wow.
1022320	1024320	The math on that
1024320	1026320	is horrible. It sucks.
1026320	1028320	She's like 77.
1028320	1030320	97.
1030320	1032320	She's turning 70.
1032320	1034320	That's what I wrote
1034320	1036320	on the Patreon is that it was her 70th birthday.
1036320	1038320	She's turning 70.
1038320	1040320	Great-great.
1040320	1042320	Great-great-grandmother. Okay, she's your great-grandmother.
1042320	1044320	Okay, that helps
1044320	1046320	a little bit.
1046320	1048320	Put in a second grade. Make it weird.
1048320	1050320	No.
1050320	1052320	She's your great-grandmother and she's called you all here
1052320	1054320	today for the first Pettymore
1054320	1056320	cookout, hoedown, get-together,
1056320	1058320	hootenanny
1058320	1060320	family reunion that you've had in
1060320	1062320	five years. And usually this is at
1062320	1064320	her place. This is at Ma
1064320	1066320	Pettymore's house, kind of the heart
1066320	1068320	of all the family property
1068320	1070320	in Pettymore Haller, which is where
1070320	1072320	John lives on the edge of.
1072320	1074320	And the unusual thing about her letter this year is
1074320	1076320	that it mentions this is going to be at John's
1076320	1078320	place. She says, it's not just
1078320	1080320	a birthday celebration. This is
1080320	1082320	about family, remembering,
1082320	1084320	and our future. And so
1084320	1086320	in one way or the other, you all make your way from
1086320	1088320	wherever it is you live to
1088320	1090320	John Lee Pettymore's house on the outside
1090320	1092320	of contention. And it's not
1092320	1094320	really the same as you remember
1094320	1096320	getting there last time. The Haller itself
1096320	1098320	is located in between,
1098320	1100320	um, I've actually got something written
1100320	1102320	for this. I could just start reading.
1102320	1104320	Yeah, you should do that.
1104320	1106320	Do a good voice.
1106320	1108320	Like Liz.
1108320	1110320	Welcome to
1110320	1112320	the puddle.
1112320	1114320	Do a baby voice.
1114320	1116320	The home and property of John Lee Pettymore.
1116320	1118320	The home and property of
1118320	1120320	John Lee Pettymore sits just above the cleavage
1120320	1122320	that separates the two local prominences
1122320	1124320	known as big and little beans
1124320	1126320	teat.
1126320	1128320	A cleavage that, for as long as
1128320	1130320	anyone can remember, has borne your family's
1130320	1132320	name. Pettymore Haller.
1132320	1134320	Generations of Pettymores have lived and died
1134320	1136320	between the teats, tending to the land,
1136320	1138320	themselves, and generally honoring
1138320	1140320	the bounty the good Lord has seen fit to bless them
1140320	1142320	with. That's at least how the Pettymore tells it.
1142320	1144320	But God doesn't make bras big enough
1144320	1146320	for mountains.
1146320	1148320	And you know as well as every outsider
1148320	1150320	within 50 miles that the Haller
1150320	1152320	has never truly contained your rowdy,
1152320	1154320	wild, and extremely prolific
1154320	1156320	clan. You're all driving.
1156320	1158320	There's one way into contention, pretty much.
1158320	1160320	The highway. And
1160320	1162320	you're driving down some familiar farm
1162320	1164320	farmland, wide
1164320	1166320	open spaces. As you get closer to
1166320	1168320	contention, the land becomes more treed
1168320	1170320	and hillier. And about 10 miles outside
1170320	1172320	of town, there is a massive
1172320	1174320	construction barricade across
1174320	1176320	the highway, diverting you onto
1176320	1178320	Farm Road 67.
1178320	1180320	Damn. Too way.
1180320	1182320	Just wait.
1182320	1184320	As you get to that
1184320	1186320	construction
1186320	1188320	detour, roll an alertness
1188320	1190320	check for me.
1190320	1192320	Ooh. Already rolling.
1192320	1194320	Right off the bat.
1194320	1196320	Mine's a fail. Fail.
1196320	1198320	I pass. 18 on a 50.
1198320	1200320	Okay, you two grumble a little bit and take the detour.
1200320	1202320	But Luke, you
1202320	1204320	would notice, and we'll get to who you are
1204320	1206320	in just a second, but you would notice that
1206320	1208320	pretty much as far as you can see past the
1208320	1210320	barricades, you don't see any
1210320	1212320	signs of construction. There's no
1212320	1214320	equipment. There's no
1214320	1216320	upturned earth. It just seems like
1216320	1218320	abandoned highway for as long
1218320	1220320	as you can see until it disappears kind of
1220320	1222320	behind the bend and some hills. And
1222320	1224320	you think that's odd, but you've read about
1224320	1226320	it being a pretty extensive
1226320	1228320	project, so maybe it's just further on down
1228320	1230320	closer to contention itself.
1230320	1232320	And you all take Farm Road 60
1232320	1234320	in your own ways.
1234320	1236320	Through these woody hills,
1236320	1238320	beautiful picturesque dreams,
1238320	1240320	gorgeous oaks, mighty
1240320	1242320	pines, stout
1242320	1244320	sycamores.
1244320	1246320	Everything the Ozarks
1246320	1248320	has to offer, all the natural beauty you
1248320	1250320	grew up with, or at least spent time
1250320	1252320	around as children, like to some extent.
1252320	1254320	And you're actually, you're gonna pass through
1254320	1256320	Pettymore Hauler itself, on the back way
1256320	1258320	to John's pretty much. Give me just a second.
1258320	1260320	I'm liking it. I'm there.
1260320	1262320	I'm in the hauler. I'm there. I'm a drone right
1262320	1264320	now. I'm a drone in some cleavage.
1264320	1266320	In between the teats. I'm a titty fucking
1266320	1268320	hauler. Hell yeah.
1268320	1270320	Hey Keith, you're
1270320	1272320	named after the pair of tits?
1274320	1276320	No, it's named after me.
1276320	1278320	You come to the
1278320	1280320	crossroads of Farm Road 67
1280320	1282320	and Jiminy Road, which sits
1282320	1284320	pretty much directly at this
1284320	1286320	small unincorporated
1286320	1288320	community known as Jiminy Station.
1288320	1290320	There's a little gas station
1290320	1292320	and bed and breakfast there
1292320	1294320	and a couple of like abandoned
1294320	1296320	mid-century commercial buildings.
1296320	1298320	You would know that, you know,
1298320	1300320	if 50 people lived in Jiminy Station
1300320	1302320	in the 70s, maybe less than
1302320	1304320	two dozen do now. You take Jiminy
1304320	1306320	Road past Farm Road 68
1306320	1308320	to Farm Road 69.
1308320	1310320	Which leads to the heart of
1310320	1312320	Pettymore Hauler.
1312320	1314320	And you see, you see all the ancestral
1314320	1316320	fiefdom. You see
1316320	1318320	Ma Pettymore's house.
1318320	1320320	You see some frankly
1320320	1322320	less well camped properties.
1322320	1324320	Sites you're pretty familiar with though.
1324320	1326320	A lot of pettymoors don't like to get rid of things.
1326320	1328320	They like to keep them around in case they need them.
1328320	1330320	So if you prefer that to a yard, you know,
1330320	1332320	whose business is that but yours?
1332320	1334320	And when you get to
1334320	1336320	the gates of John's Farm, you see
1336320	1338320	the front field is
1338320	1340320	completely packed with parked
1340320	1342320	cars. And there's already
1342320	1344320	a pretty broad gathering.
1344320	1346320	Dozens and dozens of pettymoors
1346320	1348320	all around these tables and
1348320	1350320	Bunch of ladies. Ladies.
1350320	1352320	Guys. Broad gathering.
1352320	1354320	Kids. Got it. Oh, broad gathering.
1354320	1356320	Boom. It's a real broad city.
1358320	1360320	BC, you see your
1360320	1362320	whole family there. For the first time in years.
1362320	1364320	Relatives you haven't seen
1364320	1366320	since you were small. Some you might have
1366320	1368320	seen more recently. But everyone is
1368320	1370320	so happy. Luke, we're gonna do
1370320	1372320	you first. Okay.
1372320	1374320	Tell me and then I'll go.
1374320	1376320	As your character
1376320	1378320	pulls in to this cookout, you park
1378320	1380320	and you get out of your car. And who
1380320	1382320	gets out? Who are you? Where are you from?
1382320	1384320	Well, why are you here?
1384320	1386320	Many creatures
1386320	1388320	are born in and roam the
1388320	1390320	hollers near contention. Bears,
1390320	1392320	coyotes, bobcats, and pettymoors live their
1392320	1394320	entire lives there until they're eaten,
1394320	1396320	shot, or hit with a truck. The latter two
1396320	1398320	spell the end of Bernie Pettymore but only
1398320	1400320	after he fathered his first and only son
1400320	1402320	Peter Bernard Pettymore. Peter Bernard
1402320	1404320	Pettymore, known around the hollers as
1404320	1406320	PDB, was raised by his
1406320	1408320	was raised by his now single
1408320	1410320	mother along with plenty of help from
1410320	1412320	the rest of the Pettymore clan. Upon
1412320	1414320	graduating high school, a relatively uncommon
1414320	1416320	accomplishment in his neck of the woods,
1416320	1418320	Petey left the comfort of the
1418320	1420320	holler to pursue his dream. Flying.
1420320	1422320	Peter packed up the few belongings
1422320	1424320	he had, hitchhiked his way to Colorado,
1424320	1426320	and joined the United States Air Force
1426320	1428320	Academy. After four long years of
1428320	1430320	intensive study and training, Pete joined the
1430320	1432320	Air Force and at long last took to the
1432320	1434320	skies. Although a handful of Pettymoors
1434320	1436320	had taken trips in planes and even more
1436320	1438320	had conquered the land and sea,
1438320	1440320	Petey was the first of his name to make a home
1440320	1442320	in the wild blue yonder. After
1442320	1444320	fulfilling his duty to the United States military,
1444320	1446320	Peter set his sights on the final
1446320	1448320	frontier, Florida. Petey accepted
1448320	1450320	a position at NASA honing his scientific
1450320	1452320	skills and offering his perfected
1452320	1454320	piloting prowess for the furtherance of
1454320	1456320	humanity and safety of the planet.
1456320	1458320	Pete successfully manned many missions,
1458320	1460320	retiring with full benefits and the knowledge
1460320	1462320	that he made a measurable difference.
1462320	1464320	The stories Pete's friends and family hear about
1464320	1466320	his tenure at NASA seem exaggerated,
1466320	1468320	outlandish, and often completely
1468320	1470320	fabricated. But Petey knows
1470320	1472320	the truth and that's all that matters to him.
1472320	1474320	I flew a
1474320	1476320	secret rocket ship to shoot a missile
1476320	1478320	bomb at a giant accumulation
1478320	1480320	of space trash that was headed right
1480320	1482320	for Kilimanjaro.
1482320	1484320	Would have wiped out the whole eastern hemisphere
1484320	1486320	but we nailed that sucker and blew
1486320	1488320	it back to Alpha Centauri.
1488320	1490320	What was some poor alien's fucker's problem
1490320	1492320	now? When we got home,
1492320	1494320	I cracked open a little intergalactic
1494320	1496320	pale ale, which is the secret beer we
1496320	1498320	brew at NASA. Yep,
1498320	1500320	that was the best beer I ever had.
1500320	1502320	What about you? Petey Pettymore takes
1502320	1504320	a long sip from his Miller Lite and size,
1504320	1506320	looking over at his conversation partner,
1506320	1508320	a young disheveled Pettymore boy concentrating
1508320	1510320	on his Game Boy. Without waiting for a response,
1510320	1512320	Petey chugs his beer, stands up,
1512320	1514320	and crushes the beer under his black combat
1514320	1516320	boots. The camera pans up from the
1516320	1518320	crushed can and we see a blue jumper
1518320	1520320	adorned with a NASA patch, an American
1520320	1522320	flag, and an embroidered
1522320	1524320	name tag that reads Commander
1524320	1526320	Petey B. Peteymore. The top of the jumper is
1526320	1528320	unzipped, revealing a black graphic t-shirt
1528320	1530320	emblazoned with a cartoon astronaut eating
1530320	1532320	a peach and the text that says
1532320	1534320	Eat NASA.
1534320	1538320	Laughter
1538320	1540320	Petey runs his hands through his
1540320	1542320	slick-backed red hair, the sides
1542320	1544320	still shaven in the military fashion,
1544320	1546320	but the top long enough to
1546320	1548320	slick back and settle on his back a few
1548320	1550320	inches below the shoulders. His piercing
1550320	1552320	green eyes dart around, searching for a familiar
1552320	1554320	face in the curious sea of
1554320	1556320	Pettymores. It's good to be home,
1556320	1558320	Petey BP says as he turns his
1558320	1560320	gaze to the sky.
1560320	1562320	At least for now.
1562320	1564320	Hey Petey.
1564320	1566320	Hey there. Hey, it's your
1566320	1568320	Uncle Ron. Ron, of course.
1568320	1570320	You remember me? And you
1570320	1572320	see a very, very
1572320	1574320	almost impossibly skinny old
1574320	1576320	man who kind of just comes hobbling
1576320	1578320	over to you and he's wearing
1578320	1580320	a camo fatigue vest
1580320	1582320	and he's got a Vietnam veteran's
1582320	1584320	cap and he just grins
1584320	1586320	at you with these yellow teeth
1586320	1588320	that are, you know, what's left of him and
1588320	1590320	this huge, huge tobacco-stained
1590320	1592320	white beard. And he says, Petey, I've been
1592320	1594320	really wanting to talk to you about
1594320	1596320	your experiences at NASA.
1596320	1598320	Yeah, Ron, I haven't seen you
1598320	1600320	since I went to space.
1600320	1602320	Well, since you've seen me, I've been to
1602320	1604320	space too, my friend.
1604320	1606320	Really? More than once or twice have the
1606320	1608320	grays abducted me.
1608320	1610320	I'd like to pick your brain a little bit about what's
1610320	1612320	been going on up, you know, up in the
1612320	1614320	government because they don't answer my letters none.
1614320	1616320	Well, you know, I'm retired now so I
1616320	1618320	can mostly just tell you about blowing stuff
1618320	1620320	up in space as far as the
1620320	1622320	government's concerned. I never saw any aliens.
1622320	1624320	Yeah, the official story is
1624320	1626320	you blew up a ball of trash in space.
1626320	1628320	But who put it there, man? The aliens!
1628320	1630320	I don't, well, how
1630320	1632320	about we circle back to this
1632320	1634320	later. Okay, I will catch
1634320	1636320	up with you later because I, well, have you heard
1636320	1638320	from, have you heard from Trey?
1638320	1640320	Trey wants to talk to you and
1640320	1642320	some of the others. I haven't seen him yet
1642320	1644320	but I think you're done with your government work.
1644320	1646320	You ain't afraid of making a little money,
1646320	1648320	are you? Well, no, that's, I mean
1648320	1650320	one reason I tried to move back around here
1650320	1652320	was, you know, make a little
1652320	1654320	money and have a little fun. That's good to
1654320	1656320	hear, that's good to hear because I think we can do both.
1656320	1658320	Okay, well. Trey's gonna fill you
1658320	1660320	in on more. Okay, I'll go find him.
1660320	1662320	It was really good to see you, Beatty.
1662320	1664320	I'm gonna get you to talk. I'm gonna
1664320	1666320	get you to tell me about them grays.
1666320	1668320	Ron, we'll talk about it. So, yeah, Ron
1668320	1670320	hobbles off to refill his beer.
1670320	1672320	You wander off to go mingle with the rest of the party
1672320	1674320	and Joe, you pull up next.
1674320	1676320	There's a man already kind of
1676320	1678320	standing by the keg
1678320	1680320	and he's got a red solo cup full
1680320	1682320	and he has a cigarette in his other hand
1682320	1684320	and he's got a mullet.
1684320	1686320	It's a gray mullet and the front
1686320	1688320	of the mullet is feathered out
1688320	1690320	kind of Rod Stewart style mullet.
1690320	1692320	Hell yes. And he's wearing these
1692320	1694320	kind of gaudy big glasses
1694320	1696320	with a gold rim
1696320	1698320	around the edges. Maybe little circles
1698320	1700320	embroidering the arms of the
1700320	1702320	sunglasses. And he's wearing
1702320	1704320	a cowboy shirt
1704320	1706320	and it's a white cowboy shirt with white
1706320	1708320	pearl snaps and the filigree on it is
1708320	1710320	embroidered white. So it's
1710320	1712320	kind of shimmers in the sun and catches shadows
1712320	1714320	and it's cut off at the sleeves
1714320	1716320	and he's got no shirt underneath. It's open.
1716320	1718320	He's got a big
1718320	1720320	beer belly hanging out the front
1720320	1722320	but his legs are like in
1722320	1724320	skinny jeans. He's kind of
1724320	1726320	like a rooster looking almost
1726320	1728320	with his big belly and his swoop
1728320	1730320	back hair and his rooster legs
1730320	1732320	is actually a highly desired
1732320	1734320	trait in a petty more man.
1734320	1736320	If you can
1736320	1738320	get them jeans that tight and that.
1738320	1740320	He's been cultivating the look for a while.
1740320	1742320	Probably nailed it a long time
1742320	1744320	ago and stuck with it.
1744320	1746320	You're
1746320	1748320	I love you're describing like so
1748320	1750320	many guys that we used to see at
1750320	1752320	your dad's shows.
1752320	1754320	So
1754320	1756320	the camera kind of zooms in on him and
1756320	1758320	he's already talking to somebody and he's
1758320	1760320	saying it's me.
1760320	1762320	It's Arlo Pettymore.
1762320	1764320	I don't blame it. It's been years. I kind of keep to
1764320	1766320	myself anyways. I'm back there in the
1766320	1768320	laboratory. I mean yes
1768320	1770320	it's my shed of course but it's my
1770320	1772320	laboratory. You probably sampled my
1772320	1774320	Saturday morning cartoon.
1774320	1776320	You probably had
1776320	1778320	a taste of that SMC. That's what the kids
1778320	1780320	were calling these days. People think it's called
1780320	1782320	that because it makes you see Looney Tunes.
1782320	1784320	That's not what it's called that.
1784320	1786320	It's about the ingredients. That's what I make
1786320	1788320	it out of. I make it out of
1788320	1790320	it's frosted corn flakes and milk.
1790320	1792320	And then there's a little gasoline
1792320	1794320	in there of course. You got to give yourself
1794320	1796320	a little kick or something there.
1796320	1798320	I don't mind telling you the recipe
1798320	1800320	because it's all about the proportions of
1800320	1802320	them chemicals. That's kind of the whole thing.
1802320	1804320	Use chemicals. I use chemicals.
1804320	1806320	Use all chemicals. It's just a matter of the
1806320	1808320	proportions of them chemicals. It's just something I've always
1808320	1810320	been able to tell in a person is the chemical makeups
1810320	1812320	of them. Some people say I'm a genius.
1812320	1814320	I don't say about myself much though.
1814320	1816320	But yeah that's that Saturday morning cartoons.
1816320	1818320	It'll fuck you up for sure. It's real good.
1818320	1820320	Hey I'm just kind of cooped up in that lab
1820320	1822320	back there. It's got a cot. It's got a real
1822320	1824320	nice cot. It's one of my favorite cots.
1824320	1826320	I bought it myself. Well I didn't
1826320	1828320	buy myself. Ma bought it for me. But it's mine.
1828320	1830320	She said it's all mine.
1830320	1832320	You having a
1832320	1834320	good day? Camera pans down.
1834320	1836320	It's the same kid that he was
1836320	1838320	talking to. Yeah that's the game boy.
1838320	1840320	It's a little kid.
1840320	1842320	Well I'm going to go see who else
1842320	1844320	is here today. Okay yeah.
1844320	1846320	Well it sounds like you really got a lot
1846320	1848320	going on and I feel like there's a lot of
1848320	1850320	people here and kids are really
1850320	1852320	more into like TikToks and
1852320	1854320	streaming content. I don't think it's like
1854320	1856320	cartoons have to strictly be on like a
1856320	1858320	Saturday morning anymore. You can
1858320	1860320	kind of watch it at your own schedule.
1860320	1862320	But it didn't really sound like you were talking about cartoons.
1862320	1864320	My mom
1864320	1866320	said I should meet you. I got to meet all my
1866320	1868320	else's but I hope you
1868320	1870320	enjoy talking to someone else. Yeah
1870320	1872320	of course and if you ever want a free sample you
1872320	1874320	come on back. Okay bye. And that
1874320	1876320	brings us. The little boy wanders
1876320	1878320	through the party with his game boy.
1878320	1880320	And he's
1880320	1882320	been told to meet people
1882320	1884320	as much as he can but he's basically relying
1884320	1886320	on them to shout out to him.
1886320	1888320	Pretty game boy focused otherwise.
1888320	1890320	And he runs straight into the legs
1890320	1892320	of... Well he'd run into
1892320	1894320	some bedazzled jeans that might do
1894320	1896320	that boy some harm because they are
1896320	1898320	shiny these jeans.
1898320	1900320	And above them a big old
1900320	1902320	belt buckle. White tank top
1902320	1904320	tight and tucked in
1904320	1906320	under a pearl snapped unbuttoned
1906320	1908320	cowboy shirt. Joni
1908320	1910320	Pettymore the first is
1910320	1912320	wearing some high top Nikes
1912320	1914320	to bottom out that whole situation
1914320	1916320	clothing wise.
1916320	1918320	She's got a bleached
1918320	1920320	blonde perm
1920320	1922320	with super dark roots. And her
1922320	1924320	eye shadow gives
1924320	1926320	raccoon. Oh it's giving raccoon?
1926320	1928320	Oh it's totally giving raccoon.
1928320	1930320	And immediately
1930320	1932320	upon this kid
1932320	1934320	bumping into her she just pushes
1934320	1936320	him away from her.
1936320	1938320	He looks up from his game boy and he's like Mom
1938320	1940320	I'm not your mother.
1940320	1942320	Do you hear me? Oh I'm sorry
1942320	1944320	Go on get running then.
1944320	1946320	Okay okay bye.
1946320	1948320	Joni Pettymore the first
1948320	1950320	is a
1950320	1952320	fucking wreck.
1952320	1956320	Flash back to
1956320	1958320	you see her
1958320	1960320	in the exact same outfit
1960320	1962320	climbing out of a second story
1962320	1964320	window and like
1964320	1966320	kind of reaching out for the drain
1966320	1968320	pipe on the left side
1968320	1970320	and she just kind of makes
1970320	1972320	a jump for it and as she's shimmying
1972320	1974320	down someone's hollering
1974320	1976320	from out the window. You
1976320	1978320	get back here Joni.
1978320	1980320	Zips on down. She's like
1980320	1982320	What do you fucking know? Come on down
1982320	1984320	here. How about that? And she
1984320	1986320	dips off running off into
1986320	1988320	the distance. We flash back
1988320	1990320	previous to that. You see
1990320	1992320	her she's going through the
1992320	1994320	metal detector to get into
1994320	1996320	high school and then immediately
1996320	1998320	heads to the bathroom
1998320	2000320	goes into one of the stalls. She's
2000320	2002320	wearing the exact same outfit that I
2002320	2004320	described before but she is
2004320	2006320	six years younger ish
2006320	2008320	and she opens up her
2008320	2010320	backpack pulls out a
2010320	2012320	ziplock bag that has
2012320	2014320	like a is it dehydrated urine
2014320	2016320	she shoves a straw into
2016320	2018320	it and starts
2018320	2020320	pulling on this straw like it's
2020320	2022320	her job sucking down liquid
2022320	2024320	in this bag and then
2024320	2026320	giving it that kind of
2026320	2028320	breath like she's just
2028320	2030320	barrel proof whiskey through that
2030320	2032320	ziplock bag.
2032320	2034320	She puts it back in the backpack
2034320	2036320	and heads back into
2036320	2038320	the high school there
2038320	2040320	and as she walks through the hallway
2040320	2042320	she runs into her boyfriend
2042320	2044320	Jared Krinklehoff
2044320	2046320	wearing a
2046320	2048320	letterman's jacket and
2048320	2050320	Thomas just gave me
2050320	2052320	big eyes. I was
2052320	2054320	preparing. Okay.
2054320	2056320	He's wearing a letterman's
2056320	2058320	jacket and immediately he puts
2058320	2060320	his arm around her and he's like
2060320	2062320	Joni hey Joni how's it going?
2062320	2064320	She's like don't do that
2064320	2066320	voice don't do it.
2066320	2068320	Immediately is like transformed
2068320	2070320	by the presence of this young man
2070320	2072320	and the little love that
2072320	2074320	they have and it flash forwards to her
2074320	2076320	slamming a screen door
2076320	2078320	closed and is like I say
2078320	2080320	that Joni is yours for
2080320	2082320	the weekend I gotta go to
2082320	2084320	a family function and based on
2084320	2086320	the way you acted last time
2086320	2088320	you're not allowed so you're gonna be
2088320	2090320	here alright and she
2090320	2092320	walks out the door and as she's walking out she's
2092320	2094320	eyeing the muscle car that's
2094320	2096320	half renovated that's what they
2096320	2098320	call renovated for cars
2098320	2100320	in the driveway and she pulls
2100320	2102320	out a little butterfly knife
2102320	2104320	and she just runs it
2104320	2106320	down the whole side of the car
2106320	2108320	as she heads out with
2108320	2110320	a screech.
2110320	2112320	She cracked your key into the
2112320	2114320	side.
2116320	2118320	And then yeah she's on
2118320	2120320	the way out to the Pettymore Holler today
2120320	2122320	by herself in a car
2122320	2124320	that you are considerably
2124320	2126320	worried about how it's running
2126320	2128320	and whether it would pass an inspection
2128320	2130320	and she goes into a
2130320	2132320	gas station and
2132320	2134320	she steals
2134320	2136320	a water bottle and as
2136320	2138320	she uh. Empty or full? A full
2138320	2140320	water bottle that's
2140320	2142320	theft. Oh right
2142320	2144320	yes.
2144320	2146320	Yes. She goes in to
2146320	2148320	steal a water bottle but as
2148320	2150320	she's heading out.
2150320	2152320	Roll to steal the water bottle? Yeah okay.
2152320	2154320	23
2154320	2156320	on a criminology
2156320	2158320	of 80.
2158320	2160320	Oh yeah she's bad.
2160320	2162320	She's bad. Oh look at
2162320	2164320	Joanie she's bad. And as she's on her way
2164320	2166320	out she actually catches a glimpse
2166320	2168320	up at the front of
2168320	2170320	the register.
2170320	2172320	There are these prepackaged
2172320	2174320	bags of whiskey
2174320	2176320	being sold right there at the register.
2176320	2178320	When did this start?
2178320	2180320	We've had them in for
2180320	2182320	six or so months now they seem pretty popular.
2182320	2184320	Would you like a bag?
2184320	2186320	No.
2186320	2188320	I think I just
2188320	2190320	want a pack of smokes.
2190320	2192320	Yellows. Okay. And when he turns
2192320	2194320	around she's gonna grab
2194320	2196320	a bag of whiskey.
2196320	2198320	Actually you know what
2198320	2200320	I gotta quit. I gotta quit.
2200320	2202320	I keep telling myself I gotta quit. Lord's gonna help me
2202320	2204320	this time. I gotta go. Well bless
2204320	2206320	you much ma'am and good luck in
2206320	2208320	your journey. 36 that's it.
2208320	2210320	Hey didn't I
2210320	2212320	have five bags
2212320	2214320	of whiskey? He says as the door closes
2214320	2216320	on him.
2216320	2218320	Go on then run.
2218320	2220320	And then she goes to the party?
2220320	2222320	Yeah that was me flashing back to the kid.
2222320	2224320	Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
2224320	2226320	Oh okay I thought maybe I was your
2226320	2228320	kid but you established that you left
2228320	2230320	your kid at home. You must just
2230320	2232320	a lot of the women here look like you.
2232320	2234320	I'll
2234320	2236320	go find my mom.
2236320	2238320	Thank you for talking with me.
2238320	2240320	Goodbye. Oh I'm sorry I'm sorry
2240320	2242320	we got off to a wrong start. You gave me a scare there
2242320	2244320	cause I didn't know you were gonna be in front of me when
2244320	2246320	you were walking backwards. You best expect
2246320	2248320	me to be everywhere. Oh that's fun.
2248320	2250320	Yeah I'm a pettymore same as you.
2250320	2252320	Okay I like that spirit.
2252320	2254320	I like that spirit. God damn right you do.
2254320	2256320	And he kicks your shin really hard and he runs off.
2256320	2258320	The
2258320	2260320	pettymore way. That's how you say
2260320	2262320	bye in pettymore.
2262320	2264320	As you've all arrived
2264320	2266320	you see Arlo around the drink
2266320	2268320	table. Joni I assume you might be heading
2268320	2270320	in there too. A lot of pettymores are actually
2270320	2272320	the first stop traditionally. You gotta get
2272320	2274320	your lubrication, get your libations
2274320	2276320	and then you can talk to your god damn family
2276320	2278320	right?
2278320	2280320	Cause that's what family's for.
2280320	2282320	You see Ma kind of deep in conversation
2282320	2284320	like on the other side of the party with some older
2284320	2286320	older relatives you haven't seen in years
2286320	2288320	and immediately around you
2288320	2290320	you notice a few people. It's all
2290320	2292320	kind of mysterious
2292320	2294320	what exactly is going on
2294320	2296320	here. Why did Ma call everybody?
2296320	2298320	Kind of, you know, you've left the
2298320	2300320	hauler, you've gone on to different sort of lives
2300320	2302320	it kind of seems like maybe we're leaving this whole thing
2302320	2304320	behind. Maybe we had finally stopped
2304320	2306320	killing and dying for this way of life.
2306320	2308320	Killing ourselves trying to
2308320	2310320	wring a way of life out of this hauler.
2310320	2312320	I've been prepared a way for you to meet each other.
2312320	2314320	Is that Joni I see over there?
2314320	2316320	Oh hey Arlo how's it going?
2316320	2318320	It's been a minute. Joni's been here.
2318320	2320320	You still up to all the mess?
2320320	2322320	Just making a living. Doing what I can.
2322320	2324320	Guys I'm here too. You got all ten fingers?
2324320	2326320	The camera pans down to the five foot three
2326320	2328320	uh
2328320	2330320	PDP
2330320	2332320	Hi. Hey
2332320	2334320	Petey. Hey Petey. Petey this man
2334320	2336320	I don't want to see you. I was just going to pick your brain about
2336320	2338320	something. You reckon there's a way I could get a
2338320	2340320	hold of some of that rocket fuel?
2340320	2342320	I mean, yeah.
2342320	2344320	I'd be willing to, you know,
2344320	2346320	cut you in mate, let's say five
2346320	2348320	percent of the SMC.
2348320	2350320	I mean how much you need cause uh, who's to say
2350320	2352320	I didn't take any with me? Oh it just takes
2352320	2354320	a drop per batch. We can
2354320	2356320	send this shit into orbit right
2356320	2358320	here. It's been so long since I've tried
2358320	2360320	some of your, what are you calling it again?
2360320	2362320	It's uh, it's Saturday morning
2362320	2364320	cartoons. Saturday morning cartoons. There was a kid
2364320	2366320	earlier who told me that they don't do that anymore.
2366320	2368320	So I'm maybe thinking about a new name for it.
2368320	2370320	Well SMT, it's been a while since I had
2370320	2372320	some of your SMT but if I can
2372320	2374320	I'll do any, I got some. I took
2374320	2376320	a gallon with me. Hell yeah.
2376320	2378320	We in business. Well I've just been sitting out
2378320	2380320	there just waiting for some kind of
2380320	2382320	use and here we found it I think.
2382320	2384320	Arlo spits in his hand and holds it out to you.
2384320	2386320	Petey does the same and
2386320	2388320	sticks it there. Match made in heaven.
2388320	2390320	Pleasure doing business with you. Well I
2390320	2392320	cannot wait. Anyway
2392320	2394320	Joni was up. Where them rugrats
2394320	2396320	yours? Junior? I left
2396320	2398320	her uh, back with um,
2398320	2400320	you know, Jared. I was talking
2400320	2402320	to some kid who I thought could be yours
2402320	2404320	but I guess it's not. Oh yeah
2404320	2406320	they thought they were mine.
2406320	2408320	Who's kid is that? Well I don't know that
2408320	2410320	kid's about as, he's about
2410320	2412320	as old as long as I've seen you so I figured
2412320	2414320	who knows, probably Joni popping one out.
2414320	2416320	No.
2416320	2418320	This old thing? That kid?
2418320	2420320	As she does
2420320	2422320	the uh, like full blown
2422320	2424320	throws both of her karate
2424320	2426320	chop hands down
2426320	2428320	to the groin. You can't tell if it's the
2428320	2430320	same kid or not but a
2430320	2432320	small slender toe headed child pops
2432320	2434320	out from underneath the tablecloth on
2434320	2436320	like the keg table
2436320	2438320	and just runs out holding
2438320	2440320	a comical amount of
2440320	2442320	solo cups full of beer
2442320	2444320	and disappears
2444320	2446320	off into a group of other kids
2446320	2448320	who all just start cheering.
2448320	2450320	You did it! You did it!
2450320	2452320	Run Luke! Just run!
2452320	2454320	Remember back when we were kids
2454320	2456320	and we used to play Tipsy?
2460320	2462320	I recognize
2462320	2464320	you sent me down a path.
2464320	2466320	Well I'm a good one cause you're
2466320	2468320	look, you're making deals for rocket fuel.
2468320	2470320	Hell yes! Damn.
2470320	2472320	What about you Joni? As far as what?
2472320	2474320	Making deals, rocket fuel
2474320	2476320	going to outer space like me.
2476320	2478320	I mean I'm curious about learning more
2478320	2480320	from each and every one of you
2480320	2482320	I guess but you know I think there's
2482320	2484320	a lot of skills that I'm bringing to the table
2484320	2486320	these days that could be of use
2486320	2488320	to you as well. You know you're talking about
2488320	2490320	maybe losing some
2490320	2492320	rocket fuel you know if you need to lose
2492320	2494320	something from something where you don't have
2494320	2496320	the sort of connection where you can get
2496320	2498320	in there I might be the kind of gal who
2498320	2500320	could acquire such situations.
2500320	2502320	Heck I reckon if I didn't have to buy
2502320	2504320	any of them frosted flakes anymore
2504320	2506320	bring that cost of goods
2506320	2508320	way to hell. You know why they call me jungle style?
2508320	2510320	They call you jungle style?
2510320	2512320	Yes I remember that.
2512320	2514320	Cause I'm in and out.
2514320	2516320	Is that that? Is that that?
2516320	2518320	Did I do it? They called you
2518320	2520320	the flying detriment as far as I remember.
2522320	2524320	So at that moment this woman with
2524320	2526320	the crazy like bleached blonde
2526320	2528320	perm and electric
2528320	2530320	like acid wash denim vest
2530320	2532320	full like tiger leggings
2532320	2534320	she runs
2534320	2536320	up and she says oh my goodness
2536320	2538320	hello y'all it's so good to see
2538320	2540320	all of you. It's been years since we've
2540320	2542320	been together. Isn't it kind of strange though?
2542320	2544320	John not being here we're on his land.
2544320	2546320	We're as hell. I mean what's
2546320	2548320	the deal with that? You know he'd shoot us all.
2548320	2550320	He'd shoot us all in a heartbeat. He'd shoot every last
2550320	2552320	one of us. He was a shooting
2552320	2554320	son of a bitch. He sure
2554320	2556320	was. He sure was. Catch a stray
2556320	2558320	an hour later falling from the sky.
2558320	2560320	You can still see his shooting tree right
2560320	2562320	back there.
2562320	2564320	That's an actual season
2564320	2566320	one callback. That is
2566320	2568320	a bonafide season one callback right there.
2568320	2570320	Bonafide callback. I'm
2570320	2572320	sorry sometimes I don't make any sense when I'm
2572320	2574320	grieving. Somebody told me that he
2574320	2576320	shot just would go out in public and
2576320	2578320	shoot his gun in the air when he was a police
2578320	2580320	officer. Grieving? But now hey I
2580320	2582320	I mean he's gone. So many
2582320	2584320	of our boys are gone.
2584320	2586320	I ain't wearing black you ain't wrapped up.
2586320	2588320	Oh Johnny we've talked
2588320	2590320	about this before. Six months.
2590320	2592320	I mean how many times has a petty moor
2592320	2594320	boy ran off though? I think it's been closer to a year.
2594320	2596320	No it's weird to
2596320	2598320	be weird about it after six months.
2598320	2600320	I don't remember how much time exactly though.
2600320	2602320	More than six months and that's strange
2602320	2604320	to me. It just feels like no one's
2604320	2606320	heard a word and. Well
2606320	2608320	what about the other petty moors I heard gone
2608320	2610320	missing? Sounds like they got out.
2610320	2612320	I mean I guess they still
2612320	2614320	their Facebooks haven't been posted on.
2614320	2616320	Nobody's heard from them in the family
2616320	2618320	group texts or via mail.
2618320	2620320	But we hold I guess we got to hold out hope that's right
2620320	2622320	that's right. I don't know if I want to hold
2622320	2624320	out hope for John though because have you
2624320	2626320	heard about well have you heard about his
2626320	2628320	good fortune? I mean if you believe
2628320	2630320	them tales I guess I don't know if I do. You really
2630320	2632320	think it's out there somewhere? The tales
2632320	2634320	are he was a very rich man.
2634320	2636320	I think that it's talking out of school. I will
2636320	2638320	say that uh. I haven't
2638320	2640320	been to school in a very long time Joni.
2640320	2642320	That's why you're few years older than you.
2642320	2644320	It's more like school's your butt talking
2644320	2646320	out of it. I will say that Gregy's boy
2646320	2648320	said he knew that
2648320	2650320	his cousin Freddie was
2650320	2652320	at the thing. At what thing?
2652320	2654320	When things went down.
2654320	2656320	I heard they loaded it all into
2656320	2658320	a trash truck and they drove
2658320	2660320	that trash truck all the way across
2660320	2662320	the country but it got blown up.
2662320	2664320	I heard that petty moors for as long as
2664320	2666320	they've been around have been telling
2666320	2668320	stories about lost treasures to keep
2668320	2670320	themselves busy and not minding
2670320	2672320	their actual capitalistic ventures.
2672320	2674320	Huh. Hmm. Well
2674320	2676320	I mean but it is a good story Joni.
2676320	2678320	Why are you such a downer? This is
2678320	2680320	a cookout. Why are you being so so
2680320	2682320	odd about all this?
2682320	2684320	No reason mom.
2684320	2686320	I don't know.
2686320	2688320	I just you know
2688320	2690320	you could call me more
2690320	2692320	baby. Yeah I could. Oh hell do you
2692320	2694320	need a drink? Yes I will have what I'm
2694320	2696320	having. Which is?
2696320	2698320	And she points to the table
2698320	2700320	which has a water bottle filled
2700320	2702320	with whiskey.
2704320	2706320	Joni just like
2706320	2708320	your grandmother.
2708320	2710320	She gives you a huge hug.
2710320	2712320	And she goes
2712320	2714320	just like grandma and she stabs
2714320	2716320	just like a tiny pencil sized hole
2716320	2718320	on the top of it and then squeeze bottles
2718320	2720320	into her mouth.
2720320	2722320	Wait did you bring more of those girls?
2722320	2724320	Do you have
2724320	2726320	one for your mother? I probably got a spare in the
2726320	2728320	car I guess. I could go get it.
2728320	2730320	Yeah. Alright. Cause you know there are
2730320	2732320	some missing boys which means there's some
2732320	2734320	wait. Never mind. That joke
2734320	2736320	doesn't work.
2736320	2738320	There's a couple missing
2738320	2740320	girls too of my generation
2740320	2742320	which means there's some
2742320	2744320	you know eligible bachelors here. Oh.
2744320	2746320	This again. Great. Well
2746320	2748320	honey it's been five years since
2748320	2750320	Steven died and I
2750320	2752320	just think you know it's time for your mom to
2752320	2754320	get out there. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.
2754320	2756320	Well Arlo, Peter
2756320	2758320	it was wonderful to see you all. Honey do please
2758320	2760320	call me more. I'm sure I'll see you around the party.
2760320	2762320	Well what about the treasure
2762320	2764320	though? You know she's probably right.
2764320	2766320	There's no treasure. Where are people saying it is?
2766320	2768320	You know. Like if there was
2768320	2770320	one like. Oh honey
2770320	2772320	some people say it's in the barn.
2772320	2774320	Some people say it's buried under the floorboard.
2774320	2776320	Some people say it's at the bottom of the ocean.
2776320	2778320	Others say it's deep deep deep
2778320	2780320	in the woods. I heard it got blown up in a
2780320	2782320	trash truck is what I heard. A number of people
2782320	2784320	are pressing the trash truck
2784320	2786320	theory yes. Which I do
2786320	2788320	admit has a ring of truth to it.
2788320	2790320	It's so oddly specific. More
2790320	2792320	thing about it more trash truck makes sense.
2792320	2794320	Blown up a trash truck. I lean over
2794320	2796320	to Arlo and hey I heard
2796320	2798320	Trey might know something about this or
2798320	2800320	he's got a secret. A secret? Have you
2800320	2802320	seen Trey? I ain't seen him. Johnny.
2802320	2804320	You seen Trey?
2804320	2806320	What are you two whispering about?
2806320	2808320	Oh we were wondering where cousin Trey was
2808320	2810320	I just hadn't seen him since I went to space.
2810320	2812320	She steps on your foot.
2812320	2814320	Nobody's seen Trey. I mean you know
2814320	2816320	he's always late to these things. Oh yeah
2816320	2818320	okay. I'm sure he'll be here if he wants
2818320	2820320	to. And um she excuses herself
2820320	2822320	she sees um what was the name of your
2822320	2824320	husband? Jared. She sees like his
2824320	2826320	uncle. Whoa whoa why the fuck is he
2826320	2828320	there? Because his uh. He's married in?
2828320	2830320	Yeah he married in but
2830320	2832320	he's ex married in. He's here for the kids.
2832320	2834320	Nice. She runs up and goes uh
2834320	2836320	did I say what his name was? No.
2836320	2838320	Hi Sylvester.
2838320	2840320	Hey how's it going?
2840320	2842320	What a god.
2842320	2844320	Hey how you look? You look lovely
2844320	2846320	today. Hey. It's been so
2846320	2848320	long since I've seen you Dawn. Thank you for noticing
2848320	2850320	I do look lovely. She's gone.
2850320	2852320	You can't hear this. Not a day
2852320	2854320	over 40.
2854320	2856320	Ha! You!
2856320	2858320	Yeah so
2858320	2860320	you know that it's gonna be maybe
2860320	2862320	30 minutes before y'all sit down to eat so you
2862320	2864320	can continue to mingle. As soon as she walks
2864320	2866320	away Joni looks at the two of them and she's
2866320	2868320	like you two are the kind of people that I was hoping
2868320	2870320	to talk to about all this maybe without
2870320	2872320	the addition of more people who make
2872320	2874320	the cut smaller. Oh I like
2874320	2876320	where this is going. Ron. Uncle
2876320	2878320	Ron you remember him? Yeah.
2878320	2880320	He told me that Trey was looking
2880320	2882320	for me. He might be planning something.
2882320	2884320	If you guys are thinking about
2884320	2886320	getting in on something with Trey I'd like to
2886320	2888320	get along. Oh yeah.
2888320	2890320	The more the merrier and only this
2890320	2892320	case and no more.
2892320	2894320	That's right we're keeping it to
2894320	2896320	four. We'll keep it well Trey's
2896320	2898320	gotta tell us and then we'll try to kick out
2898320	2900320	whoever he's already talked to. That's smart. At that
2900320	2902320	moment Uncle Ron hobbles up.
2902320	2904320	Hey! Oh wait no I sounded like this
2904320	2906320	didn't I? Hey
2906320	2908320	it's good to see that you ran into these two
2908320	2910320	cause they're exactly the folks that Trey's looking
2910320	2912320	to help you up with. Where's Trey at?
2912320	2914320	Don't know he's learning late he should be here
2914320	2916320	soon. Gotta go bye. Bye.
2916320	2918320	Aliens
2918320	2920320	are real.
2920320	2922320	What? What?
2922320	2924320	That's all you get for now I'll tell you after.
2924320	2926320	Come flab it.
2926320	2928320	So yeah
2928320	2930320	you've got an opportunity now to
2930320	2932320	look around the property maybe poke around
2932320	2934320	if you want to get a little frisky but
2934320	2936320	you could also talk to some more people here.
2936320	2938320	There's a few interesting
2938320	2940320	characters that you might see around
2940320	2942320	you. Maybe they're highlighted if this was a video
2942320	2944320	game. Maybe it seems like there's some more
2944320	2946320	conversation options with them.
2946320	2948320	Peter remembers the last time that he was
2948320	2950320	at John's house. John
2950320	2952320	was like starting his DVD
2952320	2954320	collection and so he wants
2954320	2956320	to go snoop around and see how
2956320	2958320	big John got that collection.
2958320	2960320	Yeah well did he have all of prison
2960320	2962320	break break break that we
2962320	2964320	need to take right now. Everyone we're gonna

3052320	3054320	I named Maxine
3054320	3056320	moments before I invented her
3056320	3058320	but then we ran with the fact that she was your mom
3058320	3060320	I like
3060320	3062320	yeah Don Maxine
3062320	3064320	Don Maxine Pettymore

3070320	3072320	Uncle Ron just confirmed
3072320	3074320	you were the three that Trey wanted to see
3074320	3076320	Trey you would all know
3076320	3078320	he's the cool
3078320	3080320	pettymore
3080320	3082320	Joe and Luke
3082320	3084320	Trey is a little bit younger
3084320	3086320	than you guys he's right in between
3086320	3088320	John who was
3088320	3090320	26 at the time of his disappearance
3090320	3092320	and your generation so he's in like
3092320	3094320	his late 30s he was a
3094320	3096320	he was maybe a rough kid to love
3096320	3098320	depending on who you were if
3098320	3100320	you were the object of like
3100320	3102320	his charm and his magnetism
3102320	3104320	he lit up the whole world
3104320	3106320	it sounds like Jesus everybody loves this kid
3106320	3108320	it does sound like Jesus
3108320	3110320	so far it's Jesus
3110320	3112320	don't spoil my Christ narrative
3114320	3116320	everything's a Christ
3116320	3118320	narrative some of you
3118320	3120320	if maybe you got in the way of something
3120320	3122320	that Trey wanted you might have seen a different
3122320	3124320	side of him and he left
3124320	3126320	the family pretty early he was not around
3126320	3128320	for the long slow
3128320	3130320	decline of Pettymore Holler
3130320	3132320	he in fact is one of the original
3132320	3134320	exedees he left
3134320	3136320	out on his own into the world
3136320	3138320	short of it is Trey does his own thing
3138320	3140320	you don't know when he's going to show up
3140320	3142320	you know when he does it'll probably be pretty loud
3142320	3144320	you know when he do it's going to be loud
3144320	3146320	you know when he do it's going to be loud and that's Trey
3146320	3148320	but Luke what's your character's name?
3148320	3150320	Petey Petey had just asked to go see
3150320	3152320	inside the house to check on
3152320	3154320	John's DVD collection
3154320	3156320	so you walk in through the front door
3156320	3158320	and there's a lot of Pettymores
3158320	3160320	in the kitchen cooking food and
3160320	3162320	getting things ready there's a lot of hustle and bustle
3162320	3164320	and you get caught up for a minute as people are saying
3164320	3166320	oh hi Lexel hello
3166320	3168320	I haven't seen you in years what are you doing?
3168320	3170320	how you been? oh my god
3170320	3172320	what's your spice?
3172320	3174320	I'm crying I'm crying I'm actually
3174320	3176320	crying it's the three of you
3176320	3178320	you brush past all that
3178320	3180320	you get into the living room
3180320	3182320	which is eerily quiet considering
3182320	3184320	the size of this party nobody really
3184320	3186320	wants to hang out in the
3186320	3188320	house besides the kitchen because
3188320	3190320	it's exactly as John left it
3190320	3192320	in the living room you see the DVD collection
3192320	3194320	the shelf that they're on
3194320	3196320	looks like it was broken and half repaired
3196320	3198320	at one point all of them are there but
3198320	3200320	Petey the first time you saw it
3200320	3202320	you were amazed it was the most organized
3202320	3204320	thing in John's house and now you see
3204320	3206320	it's kind of been hastily shoved back on
3206320	3208320	you know Smokey 3 before Smokey 2
3208320	3210320	it wasn't
3210320	3212320	what? that's embarrassing
3212320	3214320	sacrilege
3214320	3216320	one of the reasons nobody's really sitting anywhere
3216320	3218320	is that you can see
3218320	3220320	a lot of bullet holes in the ceiling
3220320	3222320	and the couch
3222320	3224320	is covered in drywall debris
3226320	3228320	and some foam insulation
3228320	3230320	from the attic that's wafted down through the bullet holes
3230320	3232320	while he's looking at the DVD collection
3232320	3234320	Petey sorry sorry real
3234320	3236320	quick sorry not insulation
3236320	3238320	popcorn actual popcorn
3238320	3240320	you can see some
3240320	3242320	leaking out of a little plastic
3242320	3244320	bag and you remember that
3244320	3246320	John used to take home
3246320	3248320	the huge plastic bags of
3248320	3250320	popcorn that they stocked concession stands
3250320	3252320	with at the Raceway and he
3252320	3254320	he filled his attic with that
3254320	3256320	to use as insulation
3256320	3258320	and it's cold in here because the squirrels
3258320	3260320	have eaten most of his popcorn
3260320	3262320	Petey
3262320	3264320	is looking at the
3264320	3266320	DVD collection and is
3266320	3268320	just a little sad looking at it
3268320	3270320	thinking about John but also just sad
3270320	3272320	that it's not as perfect as he remembered
3272320	3274320	but he kind of
3274320	3276320	fixes it up a little bit and then from
3276320	3278320	the inside of his jumper pulls out a signed
3278320	3280320	he has signed a copy of
3280320	3282320	Space Cowboys
3282320	3284320	and then
3284320	3286320	slips it in alphabetically
3286320	3288320	where it should go
3288320	3290320	so in between Space Cowboys and
3290320	3292320	Space Cowboys director cut
3292320	3294320	so now he's got one
3294320	3296320	one regular Space Cowboys
3296320	3298320	one Space Cowboys signed by an
3298320	3300320	astronaut right very cool
3300320	3302320	Peter you probably would have been
3302320	3304320	someone you wish John had looked up to
3304320	3306320	I think you probably tried to put him on the straight and narrow
3306320	3308320	a little bit or at least you know show him that
3308320	3310320	with hard work and dedication you can
3310320	3312320	join the Air Force get through Air Force Academy
3312320	3314320	go to the become an astronaut
3314320	3316320	and John thought it was cool that
3316320	3318320	you were an astronaut but he thought it was
3318320	3320320	a lot cooler that Trey had a dope car
3320320	3322320	yeah Petey is content
3322320	3324320	in the fact knowing that John
3324320	3326320	also wore blue though
3326320	3328320	just like Pete
3328320	3330320	I always picture them wearing kind of a tan
3330320	3332320	it's funny I did too
3332320	3334320	well the cop in the
3334320	3336320	season one thing is wearing blue but
3336320	3338320	even if they didn't wear blue you know
3338320	3340320	they're wearing blue
3340320	3342320	I actually pictured you wearing blue
3342320	3344320	because then when Clark changed into
3344320	3346320	the 70's CPD uniform
3346320	3348320	and it was tan
3348320	3350320	so yeah they both wore blue
3350320	3352320	also I pictured Keith wearing that light
3352320	3354320	blue shirt so you know he's like
3354320	3356320	not his cop
3358320	3360320	even though he was probably the most cop of all
3360320	3362320	them
3364320	3366320	but yeah he's
3366320	3368320	sticks it in there looks back and is thinking
3368320	3370320	like you know
3370320	3372320	maybe if we find him we can
3372320	3374320	set him set him straight
3374320	3376320	somewhere perhaps through like the rustling
3376320	3378320	wind through the bullet holes in the attic
3378320	3380320	you just hear a it sounds like a comforting
3380320	3382320	sigh and you think
3382320	3384320	maybe somewhere John would like
3384320	3386320	what I just did with his DVDs
3386320	3388320	Pete feels good are you fucking with John's DVDs
3388320	3390320	over there Petey I was just fixing them they're
3390320	3392320	all messed up which is unlike
3392320	3394320	John we'll write that one down as
3394320	3396320	maybe he did go missing and
3396320	3398320	didn't run away
3400320	3402320	you guys look back and Joni's
3402320	3404320	not there because while Jon
3404320	3406320	is family Joni's a thief
3406320	3408320	and right now she's
3408320	3410320	very much interested in one
3410320	3412320	thing and that is getting
3412320	3414320	an undershirt of John's
3414320	3416320	that has that manly manly
3416320	3418320	smell on it that she can
3418320	3420320	put in her car to piss
3420320	3422320	off Jared later
3424320	3426320	Joni as
3426320	3428320	you head back to the bedroom
3428320	3430320	to the bad room
3432320	3434320	that's what
3434320	3436320	John always called it
3436320	3438320	depends
3438320	3440320	on what time of day it is sometimes
3440320	3442320	after a night
3442320	3444320	a night of Miller lights and beer
3444320	3446320	pretzels the bathroom's the bad room
3446320	3448320	you know what I'm saying
3448320	3450320	got to do some bad things
3450320	3452320	like a good thick one
3452320	3454320	Joni you would see in the hallway on the way to the
3454320	3456320	bedroom a number of
3456320	3458320	framed pictures of John and
3458320	3460320	lots of your family but you see
3460320	3462320	a few of you and John
3462320	3464320	he was about three years older
3464320	3466320	than you so like just
3466320	3468320	in that sweet spot
3468320	3470320	for cousin friends
3470320	3472320	but older enough to be cool
3472320	3474320	and influential you guys were pretty close
3474320	3476320	I tried to drive a cool car cause he did but I
3476320	3478320	can't afford a cool car
3478320	3480320	dated a guy with a cool car cause he had a cool car
3480320	3482320	when you say you want a cool car
3482320	3484320	the picture falls off the wall
3484320	3486320	she catches it
3486320	3488320	ooh can I catch it
3488320	3490320	you can roll to catch it
3490320	3492320	what should I roll
3492320	3494320	dexterity or athletics
3494320	3496320	that's a 40 on an 85
3496320	3498320	dexterity you catch it
3498320	3500320	it says my distinguishing feature is wiry
3500320	3502320	like a live wire
3502320	3504320	like a live wire
3504320	3506320	wire like a live wire
3506320	3508320	you can feel the back of the frame feels a little weird
3508320	3510320	it's kind of bulging out like
3510320	3512320	there's something stuck back there
3512320	3514320	she immediately is going to go for the bulge
3514320	3516320	looking back in the picture
3516320	3518320	there's something stuck between the picture itself
3518320	3520320	and the backing
3520320	3522320	she does all the little clips
3522320	3524320	around the back edge of it
3524320	3526320	which is easy cause only two of them are holding
3526320	3528320	the whole thing on and she kind of slides it out
3528320	3530320	what's back there
3530320	3532320	there's a little note and it says
3532320	3534320	hey Joni
3534320	3536320	she smiles
3536320	3538320	big
3538320	3540320	it's your old cousin Jon Jon
3540320	3542320	I thought you might be one of the ones who could
3542320	3544320	seek out some of these clues that I've left behind
3544320	3546320	here's the deal Joni
3546320	3548320	I came into a treasure
3548320	3550320	and I don't know if I'm going to be able to enjoy it
3550320	3552320	in this life
3552320	3554320	so I want my family
3554320	3556320	at least whoever in my family deserves it
3556320	3558320	and aside from my clues
3558320	3560320	it might be you
3560320	3562320	and you know any team you might assemble ocean style
3562320	3564320	to aid you in this process
3564320	3566320	oceans 12
3568320	3570320	oh yeah she's folding up this note
3570320	3572320	is there a clue at the bottom?
3572320	3574320	there's more
3574320	3576320	I was like that is a shit first clue unless there's
3576320	3578320	like some coded message in here
3578320	3580320	yeah or it's the world's greatest clue
3580320	3582320	I buried the treasure
3582320	3584320	at these coordinates
3584320	3586320	man
3586320	3588320	alright I just got to figure out
3588320	3590320	what coordinates are
3590320	3592320	I always did like
3592320	3594320	you Joni you reminded me of myself
3594320	3596320	she's in the bathroom at the door shut
3596320	3598320	there were certain things
3598320	3600320	she sits on the toilet that's not actually
3600320	3602320	one of the sentences I'm riffing this all
3602320	3604320	uh
3604320	3606320	there was one thing
3606320	3608320	in particular we loved
3608320	3610320	about Smokey and the bandit
3610320	3612320	one thing find that thing
3612320	3614320	and you'll find your next clue
3614320	3616320	and you remember you guys always just talked about how
3616320	3618320	fucking sweet it would be to have the uh
3618320	3620320	77 black Trans Am
3620320	3622320	his dad's car
3622320	3624320	Jon's dad's car? yeah
3624320	3626320	is that a thing? yeah
3626320	3628320	of course it is I'm Jon talking to you in this letter
3628320	3630320	I know what car my dad drives stupid
3630320	3632320	it was in the flashback to
3632320	3634320	when they went and stole
3634320	3636320	the baby uh fuck yeah
3636320	3638320	in the back of that 77
3638320	3640320	anyway Joni
3640320	3642320	I really hope it's you
3642320	3644320	or your team again if you have assembled one
3644320	3646320	who finds my treasure
3646320	3648320	absolutely not just me
3648320	3650320	me and me alone can do this
3650320	3652320	the next clue is somewhere
3652320	3654320	on this property the clue after that
3654320	3656320	is gonna be harder good luck
3656320	3658320	and there's a little winky smiley face
3658320	3660320	and if you look down the line of pictures on the wall
3660320	3662320	you see actually a lot of them are bulging
3662320	3664320	oh I grab those
3664320	3666320	I grab all of those
3666320	3668320	they're not coming off
3668320	3670320	uh fuck
3670320	3672320	unnatural yeah that's a fail 92
3672320	3674320	your cousin Jon was apparently
3674320	3676320	Peter naturally good
3676320	3678320	at attaching pictures to walls
3678320	3680320	it looks like it's just
3680320	3682320	should be just a simple wire
3682320	3684320	but try as you might you can't get
3684320	3686320	any of the other pictures to come off
3686320	3688320	the wall and you see one um
3688320	3690320	Peter these are Peter naturally
3690320	3692320	put on the wall do you think you can
3692320	3694320	handle it? what the fuck are you talking
3694320	3696320	about? and you
3696320	3698320	see Petey's fumbling
3698320	3700320	around with a DVD he's
3700320	3702320	decided that it would be a good ambiance to have
3702320	3704320	smoking the bandit on in the background
3704320	3706320	what? if you come into the
3706320	3708320	hallway and if Arlo follows
3710320	3712320	Arlo let's go see what she's screaming about
3712320	3714320	back there Jon are you down there taking
3714320	3716320	she shoved the note in her pocket
3716320	3718320	Jon are you down there taking a
3718320	3720320	trip down memory lane?
3720320	3722320	let me see some of them photos
3722320	3724320	what you got over there? while they're on their way real quick
3724320	3726320	take a
3726320	3728320	sanity roll for me
3728320	3730320	I rolled a 76 on a
3730320	3732320	45 it's not right
3732320	3734320	it ain't right it's not right
3734320	3736320	it ain't right it ain't right Jon was good
3736320	3738320	but nobody's better than Joni
3738320	3740320	no fucking wall is gonna keep
3740320	3742320	these pictures on here if you want them
3742320	3744320	so why can this wall not
3744320	3746320	give you it's picture? Arlo try to take that
3746320	3748320	try to take that picture off this wall look at this
3748320	3750320	look at this and she's like grabbing onto
3750320	3752320	it and she's gonna try to like put her feet
3752320	3754320	up on the wall
3754320	3756320	to show that it's really
3756320	3758320	stuck on there
3758320	3760320	as Arlo and Peter walk in
3760320	3762320	and look at this
3762320	3764320	a picture actually of all three of you and Jon
3764320	3766320	like on a float trip
3766320	3768320	plops off the wall
3768320	3770320	and it's also bulging

3876320	3878320	fire hosed with your blood spray
3878320	3880320	to nimbly grab a note that's in there
3880320	3882320	and it's essentially the exact same
3882320	3884320	note as before it says hey

3910320	3912320	it comes out at the bottom like
3912320	3914320	Joni is this what you're talking about?
3914320	3916320	yeah I guess so
3916320	3918320	right about now Joni you're probably feeling
3918320	3920320	pretty unspecial
3920320	3922320	but if this picture came off the wall
3922320	3924320	it means all of you are here god dammit
3924320	3926320	I couldn't happen to know who might
3926320	3928320	stumble into my house or why
3928320	3930320	I figured you might try to rob me
3930320	3932320	hell I figured all three of you might try to rob me
3932320	3934320	yup but the fact of the matter
3934320	3936320	is you're some of the only petty mores who have
3936320	3938320	the smarts, know how, gumption
3938320	3940320	and the character
3940320	3942320	to deserve my treasure
3942320	3944320	hell yeah hell yeah

3946320	3948320	together? oh I love that car
3948320	3950320	remember how cool that car was
3952320	3954320	didn't his daddy have one of those?
3954320	3956320	yeah daddy drove one right up until the day he
3956320	3958320	disappeared and then that car went missing
3958320	3960320	shortly thereafter
3960320	3962320	he rebuilt the son of bitch from the ground up too
3962320	3964320	well what's the rest of this note here say?
3964320	3966320	yada yada yada
3966320	3968320	treasure treasure treasure treasure

3974320	3976320	good luck to y'all I love you lots
3976320	3978320	Arlo looks up into the sky
3978320	3980320	but it's a couple bullet holes
3980320	3982320	looking at popcorn
3982320	3984320	love you too John
3984320	3986320	there's a breeze of warm loving air
3986320	3988320	through those holes
3988320	3990320	that's what she said
3990320	3992320	hey Arlo you know there's nothing up there but stars right?
3992320	3994320	I just farted
3994320	3996320	was that Johnny saying that? yup
3996320	3998320	uh
3998320	4000320	I've been up there
4000320	4002320	Arlo there's nothing
4002320	4004320	so you know you know you pass right through heaven
4004320	4006320	and Peter thinks about the time
4006320	4008320	spent piloting jets and stuff
4008320	4010320	and that was heaven
4010320	4012320	you can probably smell it now
4012320	4014320	punched a hole right through that thing
4014320	4016320	well shit boys and Joni
4016320	4018320	we gotta do something let's go
4018320	4020320	yeah we gotta find the car 77
4020320	4022320	you know where you said it got lost
4022320	4024320	stolen something? what do I remember
4024320	4026320	about the car? I bet Ma knows
4026320	4028320	I bet she does
4028320	4030320	I didn't remember that John's dad had that car
4030320	4032320	it's pretty cool
4032320	4034320	it is pretty cool that he did
4034320	4036320	somebody
4036320	4038320	somebody else
4038320	4040320	I'm not talking about my dad's car
4040320	4042320	I thought of literally saying that
4042320	4044320	not my dad's car
4046320	4048320	well if that car got stolen
4048320	4050320	you flip the note over
4050320	4052320	I bet you chuckle
4052320	4054320	folks were thinking of my dad's car
4054320	4056320	by the way I know my dad had a cherry
4056320	4058320	trans amp
4058320	4060320	but that's not the car I'm thinking of
4060320	4062320	his was black
4066320	4068320	I'm sorry I was misremembering
4068320	4070320	his daddy had a black one
4070320	4072320	the one from the show
4072320	4074320	was cherry
4074320	4076320	is that right? no it sure ain't
4076320	4078320	and is it a movie?
4078320	4080320	little Joni
4080320	4082320	I thought somebody would teach you more about cars
4082320	4084320	cherry just means it was real nice
4084320	4086320	right
4086320	4088320	I haven't seen it
4088320	4090320	looking at my phone
4090320	4092320	probably not timeline wise
4092320	4094320	I was looking at my phone
4096320	4098320	I was looking at the phone on the wall
4098320	4100320	waiting for Jared to call
4100320	4102320	there you go
4102320	4104320	can I go over and look at the DVD's
4104320	4106320	and search that
4106320	4108320	little area over there
4108320	4110320	17 on
4110320	4112320	a 40 for search
4112320	4114320	yeah you know that there's
4114320	4116320	no clue in the DVD's
4116320	4118320	you open them up and they're all smashed
4118320	4120320	except one does have
4120320	4122320	a note that says go back to the
4122320	4124320	hallway
4128320	4130320	guys I found something
4130320	4132320	it says go back to the hallway

4160320	4162320	I'm not talking about my dad's cherry trans am
4162320	4164320	I'm talking about a sprint car that I was building in my garage
4164320	4166320	with a sweet
4166320	4168320	smokey and the bandit paint job
4168320	4170320	well shit guys
4170320	4172320	why don't you go take a look at it
4172320	4174320	why don't you go take a look at it
4174320	4176320	why don't you go take a look at it
4176320	4178320	after Ma's speech
4180320	4182320	cut to
4182320	4184320	Ma's speech
4184320	4186320	you hear a dinner bell
4186320	4188320	a big loud dinner bell
4192320	4194320	and Ma Pettymore
4194320	4196320	you hear a voice in the distance say
4196320	4198320	come on y'all
4198320	4200320	it's time to eat
4200320	4202320	yeah
4202320	4204320	Pete runs
4206320	4208320	you all take your seats
4208320	4210320	wherever the fuck you want to sit do you sit together
4210320	4212320	yeah I think so
4212320	4214320	Joni just has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth
4214320	4216320	unlit
4216320	4218320	unlit
4218320	4220320	normally Arlo sits at the kids table
4220320	4222320	he's done it all his life
4222320	4224320	and he doesn't know where else to sit
4224320	4226320	this time he's kind of
4226320	4228320	like you're gonna go sit over there
4228320	4230320	Joni who's 24
4230320	4232320	and just started sitting at the adults table
4232320	4234320	no didn't even sit at the adults table
4234320	4236320	the last time she was here
4236320	4238320	five years ago
4238320	4240320	he feels so much injustice
4240320	4242320	Arlo
4242320	4244320	you reckon I could sit with y'all
4244320	4246320	yeah I guess I could do that
4246320	4248320	I've got a little flow chart here
4248320	4250320	and if at the start of this
4250320	4252320	whole cookout you had decided not to
4252320	4254320	mingle or investigate Jon's place
4254320	4256320	and instead just be dicks
4256320	4258320	you would have been sent to the kitty table
4258320	4260320	and
4260320	4262320	we would have heard mom's speech about
4262320	4264320	45 minutes ago
4264320	4266320	well we weren't dickheads
4266320	4268320	we searched the house
4268320	4270320	I didn't want you to be but there were contingencies
4270320	4272320	contingencies
4272320	4274320	contingencies
4274320	4276320	here you go Arlo and I pulled the chair out for him
4276320	4278320	much obliged
4278320	4280320	everybody's
4280320	4282320	everybody's sitting down too
4282320	4284320	there are two huge
4284320	4286320	long tables that stretch
4286320	4288320	almost as wide as
4288320	4290320	Jon's barn which they're in front of
4290320	4292320	and Ma, it's her 70th birthday
4292320	4294320	she kind of comes out
4294320	4296320	from the kitchen wearing a
4296320	4298320	long white dress
4298320	4300320	and she's beaming
4300320	4302320	she's smiling to everyone
4302320	4304320	she shakes some hands
4304320	4306320	she hugs the little children
4306320	4308320	and two or three of them follow her
4308320	4310320	as she goes and sits down
4310320	4312320	at the table
4312320	4314320	and she raises a glass
4314320	4316320	and she says please, please, everyone, everyone
4316320	4318320	be seated
4318320	4320320	and as everyone sits down
4320320	4322320	do we all roll for our anti
4322320	4324320	yeah roll to see if you can sit
4324320	4326320	what were you saying before?
4326320	4328320	anti-authoritarian
4328320	4330320	we were told to do something?
4330320	4332320	yeah, if you get told by
4332320	4334320	we can make this a mechanic actually
4334320	4336320	if you get told by a person
4336320	4338320	in authority to do something
4338320	4340320	even
4340320	4342320	even if you want to do it, you're going to have to roll
4342320	4344320	against your oppositional defiance
4344320	4346320	which we're going to say
4346320	4348320	means Joni
4348320	4352320	you're going to have to beat a 40 or above
4352320	4354320	on all oppositional defiance
4354320	4356320	I have to roll above?
4356320	4358320	you have to roll 40 or below
4358320	4360320	I don't know how you want to do it
4360320	4362320	you've got a 60% chance
4362320	4364320	of not doing it
4364320	4366320	I have a 60% chance of not doing it
4366320	4368320	yes, you two have a 60% chance
4368320	4370320	of doing it
4370320	4372320	but there is an exception in every
4372320	4374320	Pettymore's heart
4374320	4376320	for Ma, who is not
4376320	4378320	thank god
4378320	4380320	man's authority, she is
4380320	4382320	as far as you're all concerned
4382320	4384320	a direct agent of the Lord
4384320	4386320	like, this is
4386320	4388320	this is the mouthpiece of
4388320	4390320	the universe
4390320	4392320	as far as you guys are mostly raised to be concerned
4392320	4394320	and she's currently beaming
4394320	4396320	and she's tapping her glass
4396320	4398320	thank you, thank you all so much
4398320	4400320	thank you all so much for coming
4400320	4402320	here today, for joining me here today
4402320	4404320	on my birthday
4404320	4406320	happy birthday Ma

4408320	4410320	thank you, thank you, quiet down
4410320	4412320	it's been so long
4412320	4414320	it's been so long since
4414320	4416320	we were all here today as a family
4416320	4418320	together as a family I mean
4418320	4420320	we're here today obviously, listen to this old lady
4420320	4422320	but it
4422320	4424320	touches me to see
4424320	4426320	see all my Pettymore's
4426320	4428320	and I know you're not all Pettymore's
4428320	4430320	you know, we got the extended families here
4430320	4432320	boo
4432320	4434320	laughing
4434320	4436320	laughing
4436320	4438320	laughing or leaving
4438320	4440320	laughing
4440320	4442320	the Pettymore's, the Pettybones
4442320	4444320	the Kenmore's, the Bradleys
4444320	4446320	the Sanders
4446320	4448320	the Joneses, the Joneses Pettymore's
4448320	4450320	the Pettymore Joneses
4450320	4452320	no matter what your last name is
4452320	4454320	I'm thankful you came out for my birthday
4454320	4456320	you see the Krinklehoff uncle just kind of like
4456320	4458320	bow his head
4458320	4460320	laughing
4460320	4462320	what did we say his name was?
4462320	4464320	Sylvester
4464320	4466320	I see you Sylvester
4466320	4468320	you know our families may have had some problems at one time
4468320	4470320	but Krinklehoff is
4470320	4472320	well there's worse things in this world than the Krinklehoff
4472320	4474320	am I right?
4474320	4476320	clearly
4476320	4478320	but I'm also
4478320	4480320	I'm also sad y'all
4480320	4482320	because it didn't used to be so hard
4482320	4484320	to get this family together
4484320	4486320	it didn't used to be so hard to get the
4486320	4488320	Pettymore's to have a party in Pettymore
4488320	4490320	Holler woo woo
4490320	4492320	times have changed
4492320	4494320	the outside world is creeping in
4494320	4496320	and I understand in some ways so many of our
4496320	4498320	cherished young ones
4498320	4500320	they leave a Holler for a better life
4500320	4502320	they think they deserve and they'll find out there
4502320	4504320	but others, others have been
4504320	4506320	cruelly taken from us
4506320	4508320	where is our John Lee?
4508320	4510320	where is our Don?
4510320	4512320	our Edward?
4512320	4514320	Aloysius? Where is our Samuel?
4514320	4516320	somebody goes
4516320	4518320	I'm right here Ma
4518320	4520320	she says shut your damn mouth Sammy
4520320	4522320	I was talking
4522320	4524320	about your cousin
4524320	4526320	Burt you keep your boy in line
4526320	4528320	sorry Ma
4528320	4530320	now I'm asking you
4530320	4532320	who took our boys?
4532320	4534320	who took Ma's boys?
4534320	4536320	I glance over at Ron
4538320	4548320	laughter
4548320	4550320	she says well it's no great mystery
4550320	4552320	is it? it doesn't take Dick Tracy
4552320	4554320	to solve this one it's as plain
4554320	4556320	as the straps on a skunk
4556320	4558320	the pernicious parasites
4558320	4560320	who live on the other side of our teat
4560320	4562320	have broken the peace
4562320	4566320	boo
4566320	4570320	who took our boys?
4570320	4572320	you know who I'm talking about
4572320	4574320	who took our boys?
4574320	4576320	and every petty more screams
4576320	4578320	the McRibs
4578320	4580320	the McRibs
4580320	4582320	the McRibs
4582320	4584320	the McRibs
4584320	4586320	I want them to never return
4586320	4588320	laughter
4588320	4590320	we had peace between
4590320	4592320	the Hollers for nearly 20 years
4592320	4594320	Beauregarde McRib
4594320	4596320	has shattered that peace
4596320	4598320	with no provocation
4598320	4600320	boo boo boo
4600320	4602320	Ben microscopic
4602320	4604320	alright
4604320	4606320	quiet down there
4606320	4608320	she's like
4608320	4610320	she's like Stuart
4610320	4612320	a jokeful comment is fine
4612320	4614320	but it has to land
4614320	4616320	laughter
4618320	4620320	also sweetheart
4620320	4622320	I'm in the middle of something
4622320	4624320	keep your good boy
4624320	4626320	in line
4626320	4628320	laughter
4628320	4630320	who took our boys?
4630320	4632320	McRibs
4632320	4634320	we had peace for 20 years with the McRibs
4634320	4636320	the Beauregard shattered that peace
4638320	4640320	what do you think?
4640320	4642320	think we wouldn't notice?
4642320	4644320	he wouldn't think?
4644320	4646320	we'd notice our son's missing
4646320	4648320	Ma's son's missing
4648320	4650320	he thought that we'd let the loss of our kin
4650320	4652320	go unanswered?
4652320	4654320	he thought the Pettimores would just let him spill our blood?
4654320	4656320	no
4656320	4658320	no way
4658320	4660320	where is John Lee Pettimore?
4660320	4662320	the McRibs got him
4662320	4664320	where is Don D. Pettimore?
4664320	4666320	the McRibs got him
4666320	4668320	who killed Aloysius?
4668320	4670320	the McRibs
4670320	4672320	who killed Edward?
4672320	4674320	the McRibs
4674320	4676320	who killed Samuel?
4676320	4678320	the McRibs did it all
4678320	4680320	everybody but Joni
4680320	4682320	give me an alertness roll
4686320	4688320	oh my god I pass
4688320	4690320	I fail
4690320	4692320	a 6 on a 20 because I don't have alertness
4692320	4694320	you know there's been rumors about
4694320	4696320	Edward and Aloysius
4696320	4698320	some of the cousins said they were up to something with John
4698320	4700320	you're not really sure
4700320	4702320	but their bodies were found in a shallow grave
4702320	4704320	not too far from here
4704320	4706320	just outside the borders of the Hauler
4706320	4708320	Edward and Aloysius' brother
4708320	4710320	whose name is Jonathan
4712320	4714320	when she says who kills Aloysius
4714320	4716320	who kills Edward
4716320	4718320	he kind of kicks the ground and spits
4718320	4720320	but Ma goes on
4720320	4722320	Noor Guard, Beauregard, that's what they call him
4722320	4724320	did he forget his history?
4724320	4726320	Pettimores have
4726320	4728320	the
4728320	4730320	Pettimores have licked the McRibs
4730320	4732320	time and time again
4732320	4734320	I see why they call him Noor Guard
4734320	4736320	because he has forgotten
4736320	4738320	but his hubris won't save him
4738320	4740320	he's taking on one hell of a debt
4740320	4742320	and it's a debt that cannot be repaid
4742320	4744320	in treasure
4744320	4746320	it must be paid in blood
4746320	4748320	everyone knows you won't want to be in debt to a Pettimore
4748320	4750320	everybody knows you don't want to be in debt to Ma
4750320	4752320	you know what we say
4752320	4754320	gas, grass, or ass
4754320	4756320	no one rides for free
4756320	4758320	Big Bo wants to ride your ass for free
4758320	4760320	no free rides
4760320	4762320	no free rides
4762320	4764320	no free rides
4770320	4772320	I say let his hubris
4772320	4774320	be his downfall
4774320	4776320	let it be the downfall of his whole godforsaken
4776320	4778320	clan
4778320	4780320	Big Bo may have started this feud again
4780320	4782320	but Ma is gonna end it
4782320	4784320	for good
4784320	4786320	who's with me
4786320	4788320	I'm fucking in
4788320	4790320	I'm in
4790320	4792320	that's
4792320	4794320	everybody's murmuring and then shouting
4794320	4796320	yes Ma we're with you
4796320	4798320	we're with you
4798320	4800320	fuck the McRibs
4800320	4802320	no free rides
4802320	4804320	fuck Mark Zuckerberg
4804320	4806320	and in that moment you hear
4806320	4808320	booming up the driveway
4808320	4810320	the powerful engine
4810320	4812320	of a 77 black
4812320	4814320	Pontiac Transam Firebird
4814320	4816320	which rolls to a stop
4816320	4818320	in the driveway
4818320	4820320	right in front of John's house
4820320	4822320	and you'll see who gets out next week
4822320	4824320	I bet it's Trey
4824320	4826320	I think we found
4826320	4828320	our clue
4828320	4830320	weirdly a letter
4830320	4832320	falls from the sky
4832320	4834320	delivered by an owl
4834320	4836320	an owl swoops
4836320	4838320	down and it's got another scribbled note
4838320	4840320	in John's handwriting
4840320	4842320	and it says
4842320	4844320	I couldn't
4844320	4846320	I tried to prepare for every contingency
4846320	4848320	with my animal friends
4848320	4850320	contingency
4850320	4852320	and one of those
4852320	4854320	contingencies was me forgetting that my daddy
4854320	4856320	drove the kind of car that I was talking about
4856320	4858320	Trey drives one it's also not the clue
4858320	4860320	again it's the sprint car
4860320	4862320	in my shed
4862320	4864320	why don't you go check it out next month
4864320	4866320	hell yeah dude
4866320	4868320	hell yeah man

4881320	4883320	so when the McRib came back for that farewell weekend
4883320	4885320	I was like we should maybe go get a picture
4885320	4887320	of us eating it for social media right

4893320	4895320	never
4895320	4897320	that probably doesn't have anything to do with anything
4897320	4899320	we talked about the fish fillet for like 10 minutes
