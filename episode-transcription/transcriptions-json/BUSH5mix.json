It's an infant of a track It is indeed this bangers first rodeo for the last time. It's Molly Healy with circles Oh I Was seeing how many times I could do Ssippis sssippis sssippis sssippis so Zach and I were talking last night pillow pillow talking pillow talking and We were we were talking about the podcast and like the funny moments of it Yeah, he actually like if sometimes if it's like taking too long and I really try to get it done I just say like I whisper is here Him laughing in his in his hands right now means that it's kind of true probably But it was funny because never takes too long because I was like we were talking about the funny jokes I was like like when I said piss a sippy and then he was I think I said like piss a sippy and he said Yeah, that was funny when I made that joke and I was like Zach. I made that joke Like I spelled out Pissississippi and then you said piss a sippy and I'm like I was like we have to roll back the tape Almost immediately. She was like, let's go to the tape Which we didn't but because I thought Eleanor made that I thought it was Eleanor too She said yeah, she started that she started the joke train talking about pissing in the Mississippi. I just made the word This is the thing my my role is to serve and then you guys smash Just like in high school just like in high school you serve somebody else smashes Volleyball through fifth grade, so I'm really familiar with Similar to your dick Sorry, I Eleanor thank you for apologizing Well, I hate having this delay because it literally is me saying like similar to your dick and then one two three And I'm like kill me which is funny cuz now it's gonna be a delay of us making the joke of the delay laughs Exactly.

Yes I Well, that's great though, I think I think you guys I'm curious to hear more about how you how you talk in bed, but Real question though, but now I forgot about it. Nevermind. All right, we're now out of combat order. Oh my god Let's start With a quick recap of where we ended maybe just some like nice shots. I'm not gonna lie I thought I just solved all the problems. Yeah, like like I thought the game is over like I fixed it Well, you do have a point that you have to take the Bigfoot corpse to also I wouldn't leave a boy's corpse or a Bigfoot foot or Technically two civilians who know that the unnatural exists. Oh, it's just cleanup. It's cleanup. This episode is cleanup Oh, that'll be so fun for everyone to listen to no No, but like I think I think what was a really cool thing that that happened because Chuck like dr. Miller She was fumbling like crazy, but then Chuck steps in Chuck like the most underrated character Everyone thinks he's a fucking dumbass, right? Hey I've gotten like attack emails to me associated with this monster, but He stepped up and freaking saved a day and I feel like we have to play that out because dr Miller, you know, she thought he was like a buffoon. Maybe I'll get a real purple heart now. Yeah What do you think from who the government giving you shit? The president it would be so funny if he's like this wasn't hard at all You know like this this this is your job that you needed an education for, you know, and she's just like, yeah He just like goes to medical school Dr. Cheese, okay Yeah, could I get like an honorary diploma or something to be a doctor they do that that's who are you asking the government The people with the money, dr. Miller is gonna seriously, dr. Miller is gonna step up and and kneel next to him and Put a hand on his shoulder to be like that was absolutely amazing Chuck or I shall call you Charles Yeah, I turned completely red and have a big smile on my face. Are you jealous during look at this attention? I'm getting from this other woman He's not a love interest of mine Yeah, but someone else is scratching behind my whippet ears and I'm liking it don't you Wait, when you said that the only thing that mattered to you is your whippet. I just assumed that that relationship was Yeah, it's a whippet We went there, huh Play with small town folk You Don't do that in Sweden, I don't I don't It's not a bestiality what's darker than BC we have to do something Okay, so you're having this moment with Charles now you've called him. Yeah, but I think also but then I on the target, right? So she's like we need to clean this up though, and we need to figure out what the hell is going on in there in The cabin. Hey Doreen. Are you going to be okay here? Yeah, do you need anything? Do you need anything like But I think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna pull through water medicine Would be important. I connect my phone to the Bluetooth and play tick by big homie G Just cuz I think she might be bored Poor Dory might be a little bored. It starts playing through the dope surround sound system in the Sprinter van That's very important for a lab Doreen starts like kind of like dance in just a little bit. Yes as dr Miller is getting you some some pain medication. Yeah. Oh morphine. Yeah. Hell yeah, right. You feel good Zack is very familiar with morphine which also makes me a little nervous for the Zack Yeah, I I like morphine More He was very he was very like oh, oh, yeah, you feel great I'm never okay. You almost piss your pants as the warmth of a taff million thousand tiny angels Just like rushes through your bloodstream and you feel better than you've ever felt about anything in your entire life And I just like giggle a little bit. Yeah You're not sure whether you just pissed your pants, but you don't I don't care You're like little angel stop tickling me that's what she says I had surgery one time where I had to have morphine Oh, I'm not like an addict I fell through a plate glass window and almost died. It's no big deal. Jeez Yeah, I was there I had to call his parents to let them know they were four hours away and I was literally I lost a third of my blood before I made it on the operating table in which they then as they pulled out the 18 inch long piece Of glass that was stuck in my butt They hit another artery and I had to have a second blood transfusion Doctor told me I might not be able to ever walk again, but look at me now motherfuckers not walking not walking Yeah, that was like less than a year into our relationship and I had to help him pee into a bedpan So anyway, I knew that we it was real love. Yeah, it's either that or traveling together It's those two things like uh-huh. Yep bedpans and travel. Yes taking up dump or travel Yeah, I didn't I didn't help him take a dump. I pressed the nurse button for that Yeah, the nurse got to wipe me and I just remember I was so hopped up on drugs but I just kept looking at the nurse and being like Your job is so weird She's like I know Yeah, they don't pay nurses enough Allie inside of this cabin, dr Rusty Hooch and Jerome Dyer finishing up wiping all traces electronic or physical of both the corpse and The corpse so my last move I like opened up the door to look outside, right? Can I see like commotion going on out there? Yeah, you you can you can see the light coming out shining down onto the Freshly powdered ground behind the sprinter van as snow is falling I mean for a second you thought you heard it's the most wonderful time of the year but then it leans pretty hard into a file and rap music, okay So at this point cameras are wiped. I Know there's not much I can do I Was just trying to make the situation realistic that's what you've always been doing Sorry go ahead, okay cameras are wiped but someone needs to do something about the civilians So I decide I'm gonna go out to the van and try to switch places with Chuck Because he needs to take care of these bitches Oh agent dire you watch those two. I run out to the van He literally motions as you run out. He just motions to a sleeping Carl Like shrugs at the camera like fucking Jim Halpert Jack Jack I hop out and then I like give a rice smile and I say notice anything different about what? I noticed that you looked way uglier than last time I saw you Damn dude, I Take it in stride and I say girl. I know this is just your Insecurity is trying to come out for a boy Cuz you know that you want this duck Admit it I turn around and I just like hock a loogie onto the ground because that's the most disgusting thing I've ever slowly melts into the snow who to know you're softening towards me And then I do like I do the thing we're like you squeeze one peck at a time and they kind of bounce oh I become straight Zero percent in straightness. Sorry Chuck I don't know what the fuck is going on, but we've got two civilians inside I've destroyed all the evidence but we've got to get rid of them Can I can you go inside and take care of that and while while I'm talking to her? I'm looking over and noticing that Doreen is missing a foot And I pull a foot out of my What no, I don't think I roll pull foot out of trench coat, nope, sorry have a zero percent and pull for Oh y'all need a foot Dr. Miller would like to go back into the cabin as well if Doreen is stable enough during how do you feel? I think I can hop because I feel so good from the morphine. I think hopping is gonna be very doable I can hop. All right, I figured it out girl. I put the foot in the deep freeze Do not touch it unless you want to use or is it in something? It's loose Okay, cool. You put a loose foot in the deep freeze. Wait, I didn't did did you get in contact with it? Probably. Yeah That bad. Dr. Miller is gonna give dr. Hooch a long meaningful look Did I do that? Chuck stayed stay right where you are sit on the ground. Don't move a fucking muscle is Chuck still in their hazmat suit He's hazmat suit. Yeah, I think everybody is well, I ripped my shirt off. Oh, that's right You must have ripped the hazmat. So you've got he's shirtless and has the hazmat tied around his waist Great, so he's got the pants of the hazmat. I have the head part on how it's Detaches, but let it be known when he grabbed the foot and put it in the deep freeze. He had his hazmat suit Oh, he was wearing gloves. Yeah, we always forget about the hazmat suit And the hazmat suit. Okay, if you didn't touch it with your bare skin, I'm not worried about it Okay, it's in the deep freeze if we try to kill it that little alien bugs gonna come out again So I say we just leave it there forever. I think I've got a fucking get rid of this deep freeze Isn't there isn't there a delta green Situation here where we can call upon them or something that to extract you literally have a point like a GPS Location in each of your phones for a drop-off warehouse where you're going to bring this body It would be also a great place to bring a foot. Yeah. Yes It might also be a good place to bring The civilians you think if you don't want to have to deal with that aspect of it Although they might get angry at you at the warehouse if you haven't cleaned up everything before you get there. Yeah Well, I think dr. Miller is gonna I think she's gonna suggest that that's exactly what they do of like cleaning up everything trying to get the body into a Secure sort of body bag and then she's gonna try to talk to Carl and Ruth as they wake up Listen, you've been through a lot We understand that this must be extremely traumatic. There are help I mean and she's gonna lie because she doesn't know if there's help She's got there's help for you waiting and we're gonna be taking care of you I suggest that you don't tell anyone what you've seen here and what you've done here But before you talk to your legal counsel, and she knows that there's probably nothing waiting for these people. She's lying Because that's her job Yeah, no I think I think Honestly, I'm not gonna have you roll cuz with everything that's happened so far and Jerome is is there and he's known these people for Three years they trust him They don't know what the fuck is going on. So they're very confused We could have a quick montage of the cleanup of the site You grab a body bag from the sprinter van kind of fold the tarp over the pool table over this boy's corpse And gently lift it with all of its blood and everything dripping Into this body bag and you can kind of get it in there seal it up and you can take that out And get it on the stretcher in the back of this this sprinter van I feel like typically there's a song that plays during a montage and I just want for the for the listeners out there to Kind of have something in mind. Yeah, what do you think? It is the only song that's popping up in my head right now is the what I want you The candle the candle I think yeah, it feels appropriate. Yeah As we as we package away the dead child exactly Dreams come true plays. Well, it's how it's how Doreen marine feels about Chuck now it's actually only playing in her head the rest of us are like When it's a montage from her perspective, it's that song playing and for everyone else it's like a fucking funeral dirge Marina's just like smiling so big the whole time. Everybody's just so distraught and she's just like Bopping to an invisible tune invisible. Yeah Okay Okay, so I can have Jerome I'm Jerome fuck it's been a long day I can have Carl and in Janus if you guys want to ride with me and then I'll follow you You said there's a place that we can go. Do you have a Day of location. How about I ride with you Jerome? And then Yes, we have the coordinates Chuck will drive the other car I got it. Doreen is like so happy and she knows she drove on the way here and still has her right foot Was it my right foot? It was your left foot. Of course if you drive with your right foot. Yeah. Yeah, and so I like try to fight Chuck on driving Come on Well, that wouldn't be my voice I Messed with this hair. I immediately can see didn't say, okay Amazing like I said, I'm going in the other car like tight tight tight. You got this. I trust you Rusty who'd you letting this happen? I? Damn Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive bitch Cuz I got him I gotta watch the foot Guys pack up Everything any evidence you've cleaned up. I need whoever who has the highest forensics 20 40 50 okay, so You're gonna let the girl and morphine do our forensic check. You would actually have a negative 20 on this much morphine So it's 30. So who had the 40? Okay. So yeah, and that makes sense. She's been cleaning up Anyway, that was like her whole situation inside this this this little cabin shack thing lean to a huge lean to with the toilet Can you can you roll forensics for me? Just to make sure you don't miss anything And Do you want I am 91 you nailed it you wait what you are positive that you cleaned it this side up perfectly And so you guys are going to head on out It's a lovely lovely January night wind is whipping up the snow into a bit of a frenzy and It is just biting your noses as you pack up everything into the sprinter van and into one of the trucks that is on this site Jerome's truck is here and They're gonna hop into that one. You see a Older and like lifted and souped up It says bush on the side of it with a bullet hole for the period after each letter You're pretty sure that one's Carl's Yeah, Jerome's just got a nice like f-250 or something like that with four doors. So it's got the extended I don't know why I'm getting so into these fucking trucks. It doesn't matter you get into the trucks You get into the truck. Dr. Miller with Jerome driving and you've got Carl and Janice in the backseat kind of smushed together in the backseat and And We're gonna leave this fucking horrible mess of a site Yeah, it's just memes guys. So You drive down the long gravel driveway to get out Jerome hits a like a garage door opener that opens the gate for the sprinter van that's in the lead and Doreen puts her one good foot to the pedal And turns onto the road following the GPS coordinates which is much easier now that Jerome Dyer has Kind of released the cellular grip that he had on this area. And so you all have full bars again obviously, dr. Hooch's phone starts blowing up and Doreen is driving. Is anyone sitting shotgun or the two of you just in the back? I'm in the back next to the fridge. I'm next to Doreen just cuz I I'm never gonna say no to her but I do think it's smart to Check out the road as we go. I think that's really smart Yes, and so everything seems to be going smoothly Doreen and the Chuckster are getting along like fucking gangbusters Like y'all are just like especially in Doreen's loosened lucid lucidity especially after the release of all of these endorphins that you've just had Doreen it sort of seems like this is a Party and then I pull out a beer and I'm like, I'm catching up and then I crack it Cuz I want to be on her level while you're monitoring her driving, that's right I just remember that she has refrigerated pants and I have unrefrigerated Mentos in my pockets and I think about how much I like those nice cold Mentos and I asked I Asked Chuck if he will store my loose Mentos in his refrigerated pockets, please Yeah, we could do that, but it could probably get a lot pulled a lot faster in the deep freeze Just a thought Maureen may feel really nice good, but she's not at that Sentence the camera pans back through to see dr Rusty hooch just like staring at this deep freeze and we see this body bag is sitting on the stretcher Okay, I'm in the back. I'm here Doreen and Chuck being idiots up in the front drinking on the way to the drop-off. I Immediately realized that I don't trust them. I don't trust that they inspected this foot. So I open up the freezer The camera pans into the freezer and out through the back of the sprinter van onto the windshield of the truck driving behind and we see Jerome Dyer and Dr. Miller having a conversation in the front Though it is silent for some time. I would assume in this truck before Jerome's finally like That was weird it always tend to be I'd almost forgotten It's kind of it's been a nice break, right Where are you from? Fort Worth, how did you get in with these people? Like, you know better. I believed Carl The camera you Jerome reaches for the rearview mirror and adjusts it to see Carl with his head like slung back Still just knocked out cold because Ali hasn't snapped your fingers yet I Just trusted him I believed his story and I knew that they were onto something and I knew that I needed to be here for when it happened and Janice is in the backseat. Just like fuck. Are you guys talking about nothing, honey? Nothing you have to worry about Here have one of these and she picks out Some sort of pill that will make her probably at least try to cool her nerves Not as strong as the whatever potion that pooch made but something that to just have her not listening on us and calm down Okay, so after a bit longer silence in the car You look back Janice is like over with her head on Carl's shoulder Janice Ruth with the most like deviated septum of all time And Carl Lambert's king of the loogie Dr. Miller is gonna continue to talk to Jerome. I mean you weren't that far off It's just that it never is, you know, it's never it's never religion behind it It's never you know, one of these stories. It's just stories that people come up with to explain whatever it is, but The truth is always darker. I found Yeah, I suppose you wouldn't believe that one day you find out or hear about like a man big fat man We're dressed in red. You wouldn't assume that it's Santa. It's always, you know some alien or some Disgusting pedophile or whatever. I know. Okay, maybe not that but are we saying that Santa's She's gonna be like It's always worse Oh Just looks at you with a confused look and we are gonna have a Drive check from Doreen marine. Oh at a negative 20 For being hopped up on morphine 92 wait. Yeah 92. Yeah 92 Oh No Fucking pigs. Hey, it's good. You're an actual. Okay, wait It's cool. It's cool. It's cool Doreen. Do you have your FBI agent? Doreen puts her hand in the back pocket where she usually keeps her firearms and pulls out her wallet and it's filled with loosement And identification She grabs a loose mentos and sticks them in Chuck's pocket or in my mouth to make me not talk Dr. Miller you and Jerome Dyer see this as well and This cop car is about to make a move You're on a two-lane country road again these trees Connecting over the top build the canopy to the moonlight to just kind of like Hit you every once in a while as you're driving just like Almost like the lights was you're driving through a tunnel, but it's the moonlight through this tunnel of trees. Oh Oh You you are the first to notice and this cop is about to Pass you on this two-lane road to get in between you and the and the sprinter man Shit shit shit shit shit shit. Play it cool. Play it cool We have we have our papers in order, you know the protocol so as Jerome begins to kind of slow down and pull over onto the side of the road the cop car just continues on past and Is right behind the sprinter van with its lights on siren going? Doreen pulls over we're good. We're ready Chuck. Shut the fuck up Don't say a fucking word as you pull over you see the truck just fucking fly by you as Jerome Dyer continues past Hey, hey Jerome, what the fuck? Well, you said be cool. I know he wasn't pulling me over. Should I pull over now? Yeah, okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry shit. The mission is back there. Like do you think those three dumbass is gonna be able to So as you're saying that he's like and he pulls over so now the sprinter van is like shining its lights You see the truck that Jerome Dyer's driving pulled over in the distance ahead of you Cop is behind you lights on Sprinter vans pulled over cop gets out of the car as he walks up Around the back of the sprinter van he gives it a weird like hand tap on the back like they always do it's like they'd have to touch your car as they approach it and He knocks on the window Dorian rolls down the window and she says howdy officer, how's it going tonight on his chest? It says officer McGovern Shout out to Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Jesse Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Mowry, Jesse Mowry Jesse Mowry Mowry Patron who created Steve McGovern who is basically Dale Gribble with a beard Dale Gribble being the Dale man from King of the Hill So this is him with a beard and this is Steve McGovern Thanks, Jesse.

He is like licensing registration Doreen pulls out her wallet and shows license registration along with her her federal identification and card. Hmm I'll be right back And he goes back and sits in the cop car through my mouth of Mentos I go And then I give her a high-five y'all we need a plan B. I don't I don't feel right about this I think we need to play it cool for now, but I I'm also feeling a little a little shaky about it All right, he opens this back door. I can't promise I won't shoot him in the face. I think that's fair I think it's fair to I don't know. I don't see another way out of here after a while You notice a second Cop car pulls up behind his Fuck I'm actually getting a little anxious. He gets out of the car as does the Backup and they talk for a second the guy who is in backup mode goes and gets back in his car Car stays put Officer McGovern comes back up to the window. He hands you back your identification. You know anything about Shotgun being fired woods No, sorry officer. I don't I don't know anything about that.

Dorian Turns and gives a shoots a quick look at rusty huge and Slowly with a big smile Opens the door and swings out That T-shirt tied nub And hops down to the ground Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened?

Okay, can I climb over the middle console and jump in the driver's seat and grab dr. Miller? You are like turned around looking at this situation and you see dr. Hooch like climbing over The Chuckster in the front seat after Doreen has gotten out Would I realize that they're planning on killing the cops? I have no idea I wouldn't have thought they were gonna kill the cop. I don't know No, I'm not saying I'm I'm not saying I'm killing the cop.

Is it her foot or nub? Oh It would be my foot because it's my right foot is the one I still have nice Your foot plants on to that as she grabs on to you and you fucking punch it immediately that backup cop just Sirens blaring again and you see officer Steve McGovern sprints back to get into his police car and The game is now afoot. Once again, Jerome Dyer is in the car with dr. Olivia Miller and he's like, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do? We have to I guess we're driving we have now Unbelievable drive just drive. All right, or actually We could block them. We could block the cops give the other team a chance I love that and the sprinter van drives past you on the road and Jerome just like Sploosh Slams on the gas the wheels start turning on this truck as the back end just whips around grabs hold of the ditch and just Kind of flings itself up onto right in the middle of this two-lane country road as the cops begin to drive up he rolled a 26 on his drive against fail on the cop the cop just Cannot get through on in time and literally just stops in the road You are looking past Jerome Dyer and Through the driver's side window.

So, um, you did well well done Jerome. Oh, thank you Thank you. Your team is Wild. Yeah, have you worked with him before I have not and I never will again Cut to No, it's fine you don't have to work with us it's just cut to Christmas And Doreen and Chuck and the whippet are all wearing matching Christmas sweaters and zooming with with rusty and dr Miller and What song was playing? white Christmas Over the radio not yet. So you guys are driving to your drop-off point It's like I gave it such a nice little bowtie at the end You're right the sprinter van and the truck with Jerome and dr. Miller Carl Lambert and Janice Ruth both arrive down in this warehouse district in a small town in Arkansas as a huge warehouse door and the pin that is dropped on each of your clean phones with cases on them Allie I actually saw dr. Hooch take hers off and throw it out the window You guys arrive at roughly the same time and The pin is inside this one specific warehouse It's got a normal door next to one of those like enormous like corrugated metal doors that can open up for like You know a sprinter van to drive through it or something like that When you guys arrive the Large door begins to roll up and inside you just see like bright lights Shining out so that you can't really see into the darkness inside this warehouse Sprinter van drives in red truck drives in As The doors close you see a single police car pulling up There are two men in this warehouse that is Blocked off to where you can't really see what's going on in the back of the warehouse There's some makeshift walls up front Just kind of like dividers and they're the only two people on this side of the dividers. One of them's like ah Man, Jim, we got cops. You wanna go take care of it Oh Okay, yeah, yeah for sure should I go what do you think Santa Claus or Easter Bunny Guy comes back out like two minutes later as you know, the first guy with the high voice he comes around He's talking to you guys. She's like, okay, what's the deal? Give me the rundown? You start talking telling stories like you're trying to be pretty vague But you have to let him know about this fucking foot inside the freezer And as you're about to start describing like the actual gritty details of it the other guy comes out literally in full Santa regalia and he's putting a silencer on the end of a pistol and He looks at you guys and he's like If anybody sees and they tell What are they gonna fucking believe Santa's out killing cops? So he heads out the front door with the gun behind his back Maybe if he's an alien pedophile Santa Colbeck Okay, so we're gonna want to get everything There's a lot of you is this one team or two teams what's going on here? We're one big happy team Ain't that right? What about the sleeping couple? What's their deal? Those are civilians civilians that were on the scene you will need to take care of them to she glances at the silencer and she's like The perhaps not that way but yeah, I was gonna say did it do they have any evidence? No, are they like trusted in society is like people with like they have a YouTube following what kind? Probably like 200 people max. I don't know. Yeah, it's like I think I wrote down. It's a hundred and seventy-nine loyal followers Well, it's like they say the first hundred followers is toughest one But she's like I'm sure that I'm sure that they can be convinced that you know something went down here, but they don't have any evidence and as far as I know Yeah, if they don't if they don't know where this is and they don't have any evidence no one's gonna believe them You said it was a fucking Bigfoot that turned into a boy corpse. So they're gonna be fine. They're gonna go back out in the world I'll tell you exactly what's gonna happen. They're gonna go back out in the world. They're gonna keep making their YouTube thing they're gonna be like this guy who helped us was in on the government conspiracy and then anyone who knows anything is gonna be like I Was a really good heart sound I think and when she looks at the sleeping Carl It seems to be his brother Actually, we could also make an argument that He killed his own brother That's cold. Wow, that's a huge age difference between these siblings, right? Actually, yes, let's not play that one then because his brother disappeared a long time ago Damn oh shit. I bet he's done. He opens up the warehouse door and Santa Claus drives the cop car All right, well I've got a clean car for you guys and Make sure to tell Santa what you want for Christmas on your way out I think you all did great. Thank you so much for working with me on this I'm sure I will be seeing you around she says lying and then Gets into one of the cars and he talks to Jerome He's like, could you drop me off and then she says like a nondescript station where she can get out get on like a train Or bus or something does not give her Facebook name to these people And sends a text to her daughter expecting to not get a response fucking teenagers I I Call my mom bring bring bring bring Sweetie mommy.
