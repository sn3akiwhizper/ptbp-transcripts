My name is Bobby custard. Welcome to contention Nuzzled here in the middle of prosperous farms and ranches this dusty mining town of contention sits We were doing a okay for a mining town, but then this fella no, no not a fella bona fide genius Well, he came along and turned contention not only into one of the most successful Mining operations this side of the long wet one, but one of the most modern pounds of round Silas Cole showed up one day is just a minor and before long he was inventing and doing all sorts of business After he bought the mine, he electrified my church here and the courthouse and the schoolhouse, too Mr. Cole surely is a gift from above you'll meet him eventually if you stick around long enough but don't Don't make eye contact or any sudden movements He's real skittish like always on the edge of another brilliant discovery I'd imagine and his wife Mary what a gem she founded contentions first library contentions got more learned folks than ever before which is a big asset in my humble opinion being there is far less crime and I don't have to do all the Bible reading during service. I Will say though. This is a bit of an unfortunate time to be here in contention. See We done had a handful of disappearances lately nothing wild usual suspects the whole saloon staff and the bartender miss kitty piano player a few gamblers the town drunk You know if half of them went missing in one go not sure anyone will bat an eye but almost ten folks within the span of a week Well, a few of the townsfolk are getting a little worrisome Not that I blame them.

Yeah It would have been better if I could remember I was gonna say a pig but it's that's Looney Tunes indeed Looney Tunes indeed. Did you ever bartend a Peppa Pig show? No, I didn't Yeah, I made the mistake of doing that once I always signed up for the ones that I thought were country singers But then one dude's name sounded so much like a country singer and it turned out to be a Christian magician So I made no money Did he try to give you was he like here's your tip and when you reach for it, he like made it disappear and you're like Along with my face It was like Peppa Pig I guess did some kind of tour like a live music thing was like a hologram No, it was like people Peppa Pig dying brutally Anyway, it was like mostly candy and popcorn sales and then like the same seven dads getting really drunk Tips were not great except from those guys Christian magician was just a lot of homeschool jokes.

I'm gonna go pee real quick Alrighty, Joe. I don't have my headphones on but I had no idea you're so fucking humongous. You're a monster Wait, sorry, it's Luke. It's humongous. Not you. Oh, that's what you're referring to I thought you were talking about like me positioned in my camera or something. No, I was talking I was reading the characters He is he's a bit. I thought I was reading yours, but it looks for the audience and he's a monster man Zach don't put this in Joe Terry Tell me what you know, what time counter is your audacity yet? My time counter on audacity is at 19 minutes and almost 30 seconds cool Have any missing time no missing time the missing time like we had when we found Justin's egg pod. I Do miss when he was suckle at my teat I Just pictured it I'm like looking at him on the chat and he doesn't know we're talking about it. It's just like Picturing him all up on that nip and Oh Well, we can play hard right yeah Did that make sense did you understand what I meant nope Edie didn't exist in the 1880s, let's get going your character's name is Everett Pace, I've asked you to give me a rundown of who your character is and you wrote something so beautiful. Thank you I was I was Taken by surprise you asked you we have a group chat and you asked for us to present a day in the life of a Character and Luke was actually the first one to present one and it was the best written thing. I'd read in a long time It made me think oh shit. I gotta write something now I actually he sent it to me, you know Like a private message and I was like you have to send this to the group so that they know what they're up against Yeah, I did not meet the challenge, but I did write a good couple paragraphs Oh, I absolutely love what you've written and let's dive into it. Yeah, okay So no one knows how long Everett Pace has been in that old Low slung sod house on the bald spot of the hill just outside of town He's just always been up there old Everett folks don't see him too often in town except for the few times he wanders in to restock his coffee and Ammo supply and once or twice a year when he ventures to the saloon for a drink as though he's celebrating something No one ever bothers him though He just looks off an unruly mess of long gray beard and an attempt at a greasy comb over on top He's got a sickly dirty complexion and walks with an uneasy slightly hunched shuffle But his eyes are bright and wild and fiery and only add to how off-putting his whole presence can be The town folk do catch glimpses of him up on the hill though He's often tending to a sprawling garden Butchering the day's hunt or chopping wood he looks so old and frail but each pull of the hoe a cleave of the cleaver a Swing of the axe reveals muscles that have been at least tuned to the work for ages Mothers in town use Everett as a boogeyman telling their children if they wander too far at night He might snatch them and can them up like the radishes and Brussels sprouts in his cellar and the kids believe it because they can't tell when or if Everett sleeps a flicker of a lantern in the wee hours of the night and the occasional but sudden crack of a rifle being fired off towards something Unseen and unheard makes the kids pull the covers up extra tight at night And so while these kids are pulling their covers right above their chins up over their noses Like you're supposed to wear your fucking masks Sorry So many under the nose Just right over the nose they're holding their their sheets tight and They're thinking about Everett Who is what is he doing at night when he's got his lantern out? Does he have his rifle? With him like what? What is he what is he doing? Is he out on his property? Is he inside the house? Can they see the lantern just bobbing along the lantern flickers from within the house? I mean that's what the kids are definitely questioning if you want the answer It's that he's uh, he's he's lived his life on this land protecting it as his own it's it's his his parcel in this world and He he guards it he he'll uh, he'll stay awake at night to make sure the crops don't get to and he'll he'll shoot a wolf if he sees one coming up or a Raccoon or any sort of thing that Threatens his and it's exactly on one of these nights Everett hears a Grumbling in the distance and it's on his land and Everett Everett knows exactly what direction it's in. It's not it's not where the animals are. It's not where his garden is Ever doesn't have animals just for the record. Oh, sorry. No animals you kill you kill by the day He lives off the land So he's he's doing a lot of his own gardening and stuff But he hunts at when he can and then just like keeps the meat until he's like needs to go back out and restock up Yep, damn, that's fucking cool. We're different now as humans So I'm hearing a low rumbling somewhere and you hear scratching and you hear earth Moving and you know that it is coming from the direction of a spot in the ground Where there is a cross made out of sticks Planted what is that spot Everett? Well, that's where that's where I'm up That's where that's where Claire is buried. That's what Why would there be a sound over there? He's you know, maybe shuffle over there a little bit and in the darkness your old eyes Do you have anything that would let you like? Yeah, I've got a decent spot hidden I've got a decent listen either one of those. I'll do my spot hidden. I mean I say decent it's 45 Did I mention in my description that my guy is an old man? Oh No, I don't think you did. He's 65 or 68 years old and he's kind of frail in general I Thought there's a chance for a birthday at some point in this Okay, I'm doing spot hidden at a 45 and I pass 20 you can't I'm not sure you can go ahead and roll sanity That's also a cool character quirk of this guy he's already kind of weird in life people already assume that he's weird He thinks of himself as kind of a loner and a weirdo. He's kind of open to weird shit So he's got the highest sanity of a character. I've ever played at 80 80. Oh, yeah And I pass a 26 well your eyes don't lie, you know what you see You see Miss Kitty one of the saloon workers who had gone missing He'd gone missing about a week ago. Yeah. Okay. The town is all Ah Half up in arms about it Some of them don't give a shit because it's a lot of the ruffians that have gone missing but there were a fair amount of disappearances to the point to where people are Starting to kind of maybe get concerned concerned concerned The sound is actually another degree higher. So that's exactly exactly because now they know that it more of them Miss Kitty is digging with her hands into the grave Miss Kitty, what are you? What are you doing? Miss Kitty get up. How far off is this? And where are you in your house? I'm curious. He was probably standing at his doorstep when he heard the sounds. Mm-hmm So the grave is I would I pictured it. It's like I said, he's on a bald spot I would picture it near the tree lines. So maybe like 20 yards like he's got a good plot up there Sure, so maybe 20 yards away up by the tree line. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and roll listen for me as you haul her out Fuck I fail a 47 on a 40. There's some sort of murmuring happening underneath the breath of Miss Kitty just kind of like I Keep approaching Miss Kitty, they're looking for you in town in there. Where are you being? Get out of there. You don't need to be digging around in there. She hears you coming looks up wide-eyed Looks down and then she's just gonna run away away ever. It's fine with that. That was just a yeah, it's weird Miss Kenny come back there. Look they're looking for you in town. Where are you? Miss Kenny and as ever it goes back into his home. Does he wrap up? Does he sleep? No So this is based on a real thing I read that they think that Back in the day of a person's sleep cycle was much more of a farming cycle that they would take like a lot of naps But be awake for a lot of the night Because they had to protect their areas. So he's he's a he's awake a lot of the night. I love it I love it. Yeah, I love you. I love you too that I'm getting in the car baby. I'm getting in the car. I'm coming over there Wear your fucking mask For the beginning Justin is my friend and he's got headphones on and he's on the podcast and I'm very happy What the fuck just happened? Welcome to Pretending To Be People What kind of show is this? This is the show where we talk to each other But not as each other because even in our friendships we rarely talk about things that matter It's always bullshit. So we may as well have a podcast where we're completely different people I've never known the true Zach. So why I'd start getting to know him now Please don't what's your character's name? You won't love me if you know me Old Zach, you don't want no one to know him real good Get get a heart hurt again Oh My character's name is Jack Perlman. Oh, yeah, that's a sexy name. I know right it kind of sounds like a porn name Absolutely sounds like a porn name just like Ron Perlman. Oh, is that who you've based his character off of? No, just the name Ron Perlman's great He's great fan. My man isn't a lumbering giant with a bellowing voice like Ron Perlman documentary he was in Hellboy And then the second documentary Hellboy 2 and then the comic based on the documentary. I Love it when people make comics based on documentaries. I can't wait for that March of the Penguins graphic novel to come out fine I've been reading some non-stop. Oh, yeah. I heard the I heard the Watchmen guys doing the March of the Penguins. So So I asked you all to write a thing about your character Day in the life if you a quick description day in the life kind of situation. Yes Tell me about Jack Perlman Jack every time every time the name Jack Perlman has said I'm gonna edit in those two noise Yeah, that's both at the same time. Like yeah combined So we same time it same time it like we always Okay, yeah, oh I thought we were gonna be truthful with oh, yeah, it's we're working on we're trying to get in sync It's hard. Oh god. Okay. Yeah, Jack Perlman. He's a He's just hit his 40s graying ever so slightly Dark tan skin from manual labor. He's a he's a rancher But unlike a lot of other ranchers he tends to do a lot of stuff by himself He hasn't really found Help that he would consider up to his his standards Basically runs the whole shindig himself. He wakes up quite early in the morning probably 4 or 5 a.m. At the crack of dawn Mm-hmm feeds his two dogs Chuck and Bob who are scruffy mutts that he took in Makes a strong pot of coffee and a big ol Biscuit breakfast to start his day off, right? He mainly raises and trains horses, which he which he loves dearly Few cows here and there and some goats just for the extra cash, but he really loves the the majesty of a big ol horse He often a lot of the day is like, you know maintaining raising them Checking him out making sure their health's good He patrols the area for any trouble cuz I assume he has like a big swath of land that he has to you know mend fences Wrangle a lot of mending a lot of wrangle in a lot of mending But at the end of the day, he either goes to the bar to grab a drink or seven having an excellent time or Alternatively, he stays completely home with a book sitting on his porch with his dogs only lit by the light of the lantern and The the glow that reflects off a bottle of whiskey So let's cut to a scene about a week ago on one of the nights where you ended up at the saloon to have one or two or seven It's hard to keep track after roll a d10. Let's see how many drinks you've had at this point. Oh Oh Where the fuck did I put my dad up Justin? Justin you amateur we're playing a role-playing game Justin the role stands for you roll the dice Can you talk about voice from now on I Can't stop smiling Help me Justin has me trapped here Boom d10 five drinks in five drinks in a good number. That's a fair amount of drinks now Just say now roll a d4 for how many hours it's been Three hours, that's actually not bad. That's not bad at all. I'm averaging about two per hour. Yeah, that's a that's a fun night Yeah, that's that's his preferred Jack's preferred is to do that, but it doesn't always go down like that Sometimes people bet you like, you know that you can't do ten shots in a row and you really need four dollars Hey, man, it's 1880 something four dollars Four dollars is mad money. I don't know. I don't know the conversion I should I bet it's real good I played Red Dead Redemption and it seemed like four dollars was a lot of money some of the guns on here were like nine dollars, so I'm gonna say four dollars here is a 105 100 bucks. That's I'd yeah, would you do ten shots for a hundred bucks? No Not now, yeah, yeah cuz I know I just get extremely sick How many hours do I know one of waste $100 for a day gone like a whole day? I would be useless maybe even two these days I can't keep up when I was a young man ten shots Did you mean when we a hundred dollars when we first met each other? Four years ago. Yeah Child Four years ago. Let's dive in here. Yeah, you're kind of leaning up against the piano in the saloon and the piano player is not playing right now cuz no one's paid him is that he's a jukebox and He needs to get money in order to play song. So it's dead silent right now So he's just talking to one of the gamblers who's around here and he's like, oh, yeah, no, I swear to God bad It's a girl teenage girl walking around the new mine over there at night Not a chance married be happy about that and the other guy's like no shit You saw a teenage girl over there at that new mine I don't think Silas had to have the balls do something like that and the other piano players like He owns this town and do whatever he wants if he wants to have a new girl ever done the walk That's right. What's random and The guy's like I just don't see it happening that Mary Cole is a stand-up woman a good Smart head on top of them their shoulders that she's got nice broad strong like could easily take a man like Silas cause she truly wanted to and there's no reason she would want to deal with that kind of nonsense in his Blessed life praise be Lord Does Jack join in the conversation at all Jack's not a big fan of gossip of any kind gosh just slinging on and there's here but he does he does like listening He just doesn't like Participating so he's kind of he's keeping an ear on because he wants to know what's going on in the town But he also so cutting back to this night. You've got your option here. Are you out at the bar again? This is about a week later, or are you hanging out on the porch with your dogs lantern and bottle of whiskey a week later What's the what's the weather like this? Oh, it's a buggy muggy motherfucker. I Think he just goes to the bar if if the weather's not like nicer sitting outside then he'll head to the bar There's a nice cool breeze. He'll take it outside and kind of chill but you know, you know how Ranchers in the Old West love to chill Take it mad easy. Keep it mad posse It's the Old West bro Yeah, I heard that they they they had a net that they would have to keep the bugs out There was on a stick and they were just you know Net stick and chill Oh my god That was a bad one But I appreciate it cuz you put a lot of thought into it I put a little thought into it So as you're coming home from the bar What do you ride I think just like a good old strong I can't remember the differences between the horses. I used to actually kind of know from old red dead But it's like it's like one of those like it's a larger than average like strong Horse a good like worker horse. That's like my I don't care about that. What's its name? Oh, what's its name? No, I do care. But also what's its name Jeremiah? Oh, yeah, so you're riding Jeremiah back and you hear a Oh Coming from the field that you own and you know It's the right here attempted a horse. It's the crying of a horse I don't know what they sound like Was that a sound of a horse or is that yeah, you're you're okay You know, I didn't know there's an old man dying All right, so you hear this as you're approaching your home What do you do I kick up the speed swords the source of the noise roll alertness for me? Oh, is there alertness in this game? Fuck we're playing down darker trails, which is the Old West Setting for Call of Cthulhu and spot hidden baby old spot hidden, okay Well, I rolled a 10 That'll probably be 16. Yeah. I was like I rolled a dick. Why was I doing? amateur hour over here Welcome to the show Justin get your shit together You roll a 16 on spot hidden and as you're approaching You're riding toward the noise and looking off into the distance. You see a thin silhouette dipping off fast into the distance 40 50 yards away from this horse that is still 20 to 30 yards away from you So almost a football field away You see this this very slight figure that is just Running and with that roll. You can see it's a humanoid but it's running like Like a wild animal and you said it's like a football field away almost. Yeah. Hey, what'd you do to my horse? Stop it will not stop it only continues Is it cooking at a speed that I could catch up with it on horseback Or is it so far away that it's like scurrying into the the wild it's heading into the wild at this point But you could chase it through the wild if you could track it Yeah, I don't feel comfortable doing that. I'm gonna go to where the horses are. I can kill you tonight if that's what yeah I'm good. I don't have tracking and it's the night and there's a ghoulish ghoul of some kind No, but I'll go to the horse to go ahead and roll sanity for how fast this it's like it's inhumanely exactly unhumanly fast Well, I need to roll two dice, please That's that's a 98 baby that's not gonna pass there does it though No, I got no Lose one sanity as you realize There's something in contention that is not human and you look up at the stars and it's a clear night sky and as you're kind of like Toward this Old man or sound You know The world isn't what you thought it might have been if something like that Exists here and when you make it up to your horse, I need you to roll another sanity check because I'm surprised at how injured it is 40 I pass whatever this thing was It clearly was here for meat It knew exactly where to shred the skin of This horse to pull out the most muscle the quickest and there are Just holes on the haunches and in the shoulders of this horse that is on the ground You can kind of see through where its chest is The muscle is completely missing and you can just see it's that the top rib on its left side Where it's laying on its right? I Gently hop off my horse my damn dandelion. No, I Walk up to it with my revolver and I cock it and I look at it I'm sorry, I couldn't be here for you when you needed me and with that I put dandelion out of its misery Jack looks away Sheathing or whatever he caught putting his gun back in his holster wipes a couple tears away from his face and gets back on his horse to make the rounds to make sure Everybody else is safe I Tell us Cox, what are your thoughts about the situation now? I can hear I said Thomas Cox What are your thoughts about the situation at hand? I don't know a whole lot about it Zack. It's the Old West That I like that tell me about your character people are missing and that that won't stand That's the thing we're gonna try to get to the bottom of here I bet it'll work out for us I bet it will too. I've set this whole thing up to where you guys can look at Justin. I see meditating That's what I thought too, but we're gonna look like assholes when we're talking about this on the podcast and he's just dead There he goes He moved Thank God Yeah, so hey I'm playing Hold on I realized I never googled my character's name I Did anybody terrible? Nope? Okay, the guy who came up with the the he's the doctor who came up with the like air pathway Thing where you shove a pin in somebody's throat and EpiPen or a trachea Trachea and it's not spelled the same way. I immediately thought Horace Grant Oh Horace Green oh shit is the school from rock. Okay. Well, I am I'm playing a professor Horace Green and he is a Naturalist a paleontologist He searches for ancient creatures from the past and they're fossils and and and they're remnants Sick, does he just put bones together and call it what he thinks it is some some Huxters in his like profession do that, but he is a trained naturalist he he's at the cutting edge of modern of modern theory when it comes to paleo biology and he I don't know if that's a word back then but that's that's what he does man. That's what he lives and breathes It's a word now. Mm-hmm. I'm not in character yet, so I can say it's not exactly I'm just trying to I'm just trying to Clean it exactly who can say that before he was terribly killed by whatever Delta green monsters Zach has in store for us that professor Horace Horace Green Does not did not coin the term paleo biology and I asked you to write me a Like a day not just for me but also for you to get to learn about your character even more through the Practice of writing this was actually helpful and also for the listeners to get to know your character even more I was telling Joe earlier. This is the best decision we've ever made for For writing new character direction, yeah instead of just doing it Exactly, I really dig it. So yeah any give me what you got any DMS or GMs listening. This is a really good This is a cool mechanic before you run a game that being said I didn't know it would be read publicly So I will have to self-edit and clean this up as I go along because I sent Zach just a filthy Version so it was mostly pictures crude Crude scribblings really I was like wow. I know exactly who this character is Professor Horace Green leaves his bed at 530 Although he has generally been awake for an hour or more at this point Staring at the ceiling or the curtains or a sleeping cat easy it Observing but not quite seeing these things as he lets his jumbled rush of thoughts flow freely Until they have sorted themselves into something like order He picks his way through the stacks of books that litter his floor and heads downstairs to the parlor Where the widow Anderson is already waiting with coffee He stayed at the hotel the first few months he was in town But he found himself in frequent disagreement with that establishment over payments and acceptable level of cat excretions Returning from his shell one day. He found the hotel and employed the washer woman's daughter to clean his room He opened the door to see her rearranging his table of vertebrae and promptly fled to the washroom to weep Since then he has stayed at the widow Anderson's boarding house She rises as early as he does and enjoys stiff coffee and silence in the mornings The other boarders are young men They leave quickly in the morning to make their shifts at the mine and stay out of the saloons until late at night The widow is content to leave Horace to his vertebrae and his cat enjoys her company when he is away After drinking his coffee and reading the papers Horace heads to his shale Following the creek a short distance out of town He comes to the rocky outcropping that he hopes holds the answers to his most burning questions And so Horace begins his work He chips and digs at his shale looking for signs of the monsters who once roamed this land It has been months and he has found nothing like the vertebrae that first brought him here They plainly belonged to a mosasaurus, but he had never seen or read of any specimens so large Local children will sometimes come down after their morning chores to help the crazy old professor sift through his rocks and mud But on this day is alone by the early evening He has found no signs of his mosasaurus and returns to town Making a point to stop by the hotel restaurant to enjoy his supper before changing out of his muddy clothes He cleans himself at the boarding house and reads the evening papers with the widow while he's he had sleeps in his lap He retires to his room where he will read or respond to one of his many professional Correspondents or diagram as vertebrae hearing the young boarders returning from the saloon. He knows it is time to retire He tells easy at good night Scratches his head and turns out his lamp and as soon as it's dark you hear one of your young minor neighbors drunkenly going on about one of his ex-colleagues a Regular gambler at the saloon who is counted among those recently missing in contention I Swear God is my witness Thomas told me in confidence. He said he he said found oil down there But like it was alive Like moving and breathing in the light Last week last we all saw of him. He was arguing loudly up in mr. Cole's office And then it was it was just silent. No, I'm not saying shit to Anyone about that cuz I don't want to be the next one missing So that's why I'm not gonna die. I'm not going to that meeting. No, I'm not gonna go I'm not but that I'm not telling anyone. No, no, no, no one I wouldn't tell I I mean, yeah I might know more but I'm not telling anyone am I know I'm not Just cuz Thomas is all missing and shit cuz he's arguing with mr. Cole Hmm seems a fellow named Thomas is missing from from his normal gambling Habits and and mine working after finding a living oil and arguing with mr. Cole I'll file that away living living oil That could be something that's what dinosaurs are now dinosaurs are birds Zach. Fuck wait So does that mean dinosaurs aren't real? Yeah If birds came from dinosaurs, then why are they still dinosaurs? Luke What up, what are you learning learning like larva Joe said It's fucking nasty Joe said they're wiggling around your Character description day in the life writing assignment Was so good that it like made him feel like he had to take it up a notch when he wrote his good I'm glad yours is still the best one though. Do you want to describe your character? Yeah, my My character is Ephraim Cortland Judge Ephraim Cortland. He is a very tall large man 43 years old but looks Looking at him. You don't you couldn't really tell how old he is. He's just Just a disgusting. He's a slop of a human. He's a slop. He barely takes care of himself Just soars all over him from like barely washing and not washing his clothes Always has like grease and food in his mustache and on his face. He's always sweaty Greasy hair dirty fingernails and Hands just fucking gross is his guys deal. Why is he so nasty? Well, he was a well-respected judge Fair and well respected but about six years ago his wife and his daughter died from cholera And that pretty much is a redone. Yeah, he always Boils his water before he drinks it now. Does he have taste buds? He probably not because he smokes he smoked cigars. He smokes hand-rolled cigarettes He chews tobacco. He's known to make he's known to make tea with tobacco. Oh He uses that as a chaser for his whiskey He always keeps iced fully stocked bar with really nice whiskey But he he buys nice stuff so that people don't think he's a drunk Yeah, so people think he's classy but he is a drunk drinks heavily throughout the day always has a he's got a flask on him It's a metal flask like bound with leather and on on the flask. It says to EC from our EC with love Ruth Ruth Courtland was his wife So he keeps that it's very special to him always filled with whiskey How big is it how big is the flask yeah think of like a regular flask Four times that big so it's like it can fit a hell of a lot of whiskey in it So I needed to buy a flask when I was 16 years old. Yeah, not for drinking purposes But because I was playing Taney Zuko in Grease at my high school's production, of course and I needed a flask got that lead as a sophomore baby, and so I And so I went to an antique store and I bought a flask and I thought to myself this is kind of a big flask But I didn't I didn't drink that much so you didn't really know when I was 16. It was like Stealing nips from people's parents basements and such right, but I learned later when I used that flask It held half a fifth of shit. Yeah, that's 375 milliliters, I'd say that's about yeah half a fifth is what this can can hold He always has it on him his clothes that he wears since he is a judge Usually like three-piece suits and stuff, but they have not been washed or taken care of He has no intention of buying any new clothes. So they're ratty and holes and stuff in them He always make sure there's an inner pocket for his flask though. Of course. All right, read me this read me this thing, baby Judge Ephraim Courtland wakes up in his comfy puffy leather chair The greasy plate is broken on the ground beside him missing the half pound of bacon It held the night before which was eaten far too quickly by the judge and washed down with a half a bottle of expensive whiskey Ephraim wipes his face with the back of his sleeve smearing grease and bits of bacon into his salt and pepper horseshoe mustache His stomach churns out a low gurgle like the sound of that sweet black gold when it bubbles up from the earth Ephraim struggles to stand up from his chair the effects of the whiskey from the night before have not yet worn off and his weight does Not help the cause as he rises up from the chair His top hat scrapes the roof of his modest home His 43 year old bones hold him up at 6 foot 10 and carries a little over 300 pounds of booze and pork filled fat The man looks like he's falling apart as if his skin was one paper cut away from expelling the rotten insides and decaying flesh he takes his top hat off and bends over holding the makeshift barf bag expectantly in front of him a Minute passes but the only bodily fluid in the hat is sweat that is profusely dripping off the man's balding head He tosses the hat to the ground and strips down naked He boils water for a bath buying some half-cooked bacon left on the dining table from the night before Against his better judgment. He finishes the undercooked fatty pork before the flies can after breakfast He decides against a hot bath. It's much too hot already He half-heartedly washes himself in a cool bath just enough to be almost presentable for court He comes as long graying patchy hair across his head and oils up his mustache He picks up an earthy tweed three-piece suit off the floor and dresses himself Bending over to put on his socks and shoes He feels dizzy his top hat finally fulfills its purpose as he empties his guts into his felt and silk wastebasket He straightens himself up feeling much better and removes a flask from his jacket He drains the flask in one goal that fills it with a half empty bottle from the night before He takes one last swig from the bottle switches it around his mouth Gargles and spits it into the top hat he tucks his flask back into his suit jacket and heads toward the door As he walks outside, he figures it to be around noon He was due at the courthouse at 9, but he knows he will be fine as he is the only judge for miles Plus the townsfolk won't get too upset if they can't pay their fine for not hitching their horse or getting unruly at the bar Did he put his hat back on no, thank God It's like what the fuck no, does he wash out his hat? No, I just leave it just leaves it on the floor Okay, so we're gonna cut back to about a week ago. This is a few days before one of the gamblers disappeared and A couple of them got into a got a pretty unruly Unruly enough to where one of them was locked up at the courthouse and Courtland is walking through and this guy completely He's got mine face not mine Yeah, but he's kind of my main because his hands are up against the bars in front of him But there's actual bars there. So he's really good at miming, right? And he sticks his head in between two of the bars His eyes get really big and he's like, you know Mrs. Cole she ain't human Ephraim just looks at the guy and like the guys holding on to the bars of the prison cell and he just punches his fingers into the bar of the Cell and you just hear the laughter continue as this man backs away into the darkness of his cell He kind of eyes the guy and just stops for a second and then continues walking back to the day in question Ephraim still gazing up at the blaring Sun whistles a long loud note and clicks his tongue a Colossal shiny brown and white Clydesdale saunters over and looks at the judge. We're late. Hey, mister Let's go the juxtaposition of this elegant well-groomed horse and the off-putting nauseating giant of a man confuses the locals How could a man like that own that horse? Ephraim Courtland mounts the horse effortlessly his grace opposite of everything else in his life He takes off at breakneck speed on his steed kicking up an enormous dust cloud as he races towards the courthouse As he rides, there are only two things on his mind his horse and how many men he wants to hang today And when Ephraim gets to the courthouse When he walks in he goes to flip on the lights the new electrical system has made Electrical lighting possible here in the courthouse. Thanks to all Silas Cole the genius and contention and as you flip them on there's nothing What's wrong what oh oh gosh, oh no, I'm sorry mister Um, it's just that it seems to be that the the copper wiring has been stolen paralegal comes running up Yes, no, um, it seems to be that all the copper wiring has been stolen out from the courthouse Nighttime why I don't know but it might be worth it to bring it up at the meeting today How do you know who told you what is this and I grab it out of her hands? And you see that there's a letter Requesting your presence at the town hall meeting at the church to discuss Disappearances what time is the meeting? You're already late. Well, I'm As I'll be going over there and Fix the fucking lights and I walk out and get back on my horse and right over to the town hall meeting quickly fast Oh Oh You know Oh Oh Can't you have wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling You", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0600000000000005, "text": " Howdy partners, it's your ding-dang big bang shooting rowdy son of a gun wolf the dog", "tokens": [50363, 1374, 9892, 4887, 11, 340, 338, 534, 44852, 12, 67, 648, 1263, 20188, 4395, 5752, 9892, 3367, 286, 257, 2485, 17481, 262, 3290, 50716], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.269094696964126, "compression_ratio": 1.452127659574468, "no_speech_prob": 0.03603486716747284}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 7.34, "end": 14.38, "text": " Can I get a yee-howl?
