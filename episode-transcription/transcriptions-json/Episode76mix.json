We've real people man Kind of we're pretending to be 76 the good people. Oh, yeah, you guys are the people people like you guys are great people So I did tell you last time that we played that the next time that we played You would be back as Who you are? So I want you to get into the consciousness of your characters. John Lee Pettymore Clark Bishop Keith Vigna Remember What it feels like? inside the skin of these Trash people. Oh boy. It's me clock And it's me oh, I'm I'm back baby Paul Lee Pettymore if that part makes the podcast I quit You are now John Lee Pettymore Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop John John Lee Kevin Moore. Is that what you view yourself as? I feel like it's the best portmanteau to describe portmanteau The best portmanteau To describe his current situation. Yeah, also since he's made of since he's made of metal and is basically a robo cop Will you beef up my stats? Can I get cool stats? Well you cool stats, please Okay, yeah, that's fine give yourself a plus 10 to strength and Constitution and a negative 10 to dexterity and Keith Vigna do the same plus 10 to the base, right so that 20 strength 20 Constitution 3 dexterity Oh Thomas when you see your character in a dream in the mirror what version is it? What does he look like? John og the fourth correct canonically the og yes from Not like the from the first episode of pretending to be people a new hope So that is the version that you all see when you see yourselves existing in An infinite darkness and you feel eyes on you all over you out of your own bodies floating in this vast nothingness you see Keith Vigna open a door and Tildy be Mitchell is there on the other side curled up in the fetal position and her body begins Deteriorating hastily like she has leprosy but in time-lapse However, she grows larger and larger with each passing moment Clark Bishop is seen handing an old piece of parchment to a young boy with a balloon shaped head and eyes so dark that the irises look black and immediately the boys feet catch fire and the fire grows and grows to consume the young black eyed boy and You hear three voices cry out in pain John Lee Pettymore Is crouched down crouched down He's crouched down staring at a television. That is a blank white screen He reaches out and touches the screen like Vanna White But instead of a letter popping up Clark Bishop's parents Eunice and Jerry the size of action figures Jump out of the television screen and run up John Lee Pettymore the fourth arm Climbing his shoulder and flinging themselves into John's head No, the bishops are going to disappear right into petty Moore's brain But they both get stuck halfway in their legs writhing about and flailing in this never-ending dreamscape Oily viscous sludge begins dripping and then spraying out of John Lee Pettymore the force head Where the bishops have lodged themselves and the ooze begins Collecting on a ground below now made of light and the ooze drip strips drips and then pours until a laminar flow Connects the head of John Lee Pettymore the fourth to a pool of this inky substance that begins shaping itself Into a large saucer, but as the pool grows the walls begin rising outward Creating an imposingly colossal Bowl and our view must back up leagues as this shape continues to form a mirror of what is now below the minuscule body of John Lee Pettymore in the far distance continues to fill this thing's final form an incomprehensibly massive sphere and it continues to grow and grow and grow and Then The three of you wake up you feel like you're in shock your stomach feels weirdly full and Your ears are ringing and you feel content, but it's dark and it's cold and it smells smells like Almost sweet like like there's meat maybe Your Eyes begin to adjust and there's a pool of blood on the floor next to it is a coffin on the ground and this mausoleum And you look at each other Blood splatters speckled all over each one of you John Lee Kevin Moore and all black tactical gear Keith vigna and his brightly colored polo and boat shoes Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak and the shock Begins to wear off and you feel the searing pain you felt before on your chest on your back on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm and This time when you guys look around at each other and check each other's Skin, not only is the word Marvin crossed out But the word Maggie on each of your left feet is also crossed out. Hello again, boys Are we is this we're back we're back this is this is where we woke up last time we made it Again, how many times is this now? This would be the 30s. How many times are we gonna do this? This is the third time that we've woken up in here But this is the second time after we've died right where was Maggie written on our bodies our feet I take my shoe off because my foot is super itchy and I start scratching it and then realize that it's Exed out the only two names left her Drew and Tilly What do you guys think we did that made the Maggie get crossed off? I mean the last thing I remember is is Just piles of cash at the University What Does Clark remember of like the feeling that he had before he did what he did like this He how does that feel to him thinking about that? Oh, not good. Not good at all Because basically you were under a compulsion and you had no control over your body that you now have control over but That has to make you wonder how long do you have control over your body? And how easy was it for it to be taken over? However, you guys are all back up to full hit points And your luck will start where it was last time except for we discussed luck That was awarded that was not used which is plus five for me and plus ten for Joe. I believe so Yeah, so I think I have 35. Does that sound right? It does have we ever canonically described John Lee Kevin Moore's Appearance I mean not a whole lot. I think you have full reigns in episode 76 here to Tell us what he looks like going into this arc Sam Elliott and Roadhouse. Oh That's it that's I thought you were gonna Hell yeah, what a man. Oh, yeah Taylor and I watched Roadhouse like a month ago I still have never seen either one of us had ever seen it. I also watched it for the first time like last fall It's wild Was it good? It's really fucking good. It's a watch. It is extremely entertaining. So absurd. I've only ever seen bits and pieces I don't think I've ever said and watch the whole thing through an Insanely like psychotic mob boss for no reason tries to take over this small, Missouri town. Oh, it's in Missouri Patrick So, yep, Patrick Swayze Who is like a world-famous bouncer within the world's like the John wick of bouncers So he he gets a job like at a bar in the town to clean it up and he moves into this loft above Is he above the mechanic shop or on like a farm or something? Anyway for whatever reason he rents this loft that ends up being directly across this like small river from villains mansion Villains just out there like watching him while he does fucking Tai Chi in the yard and shit There's a lot of shots of him doing Tai Chi in the yard. It's great. What about our sanity so your sanity is going to Start Wherever it was when you woke up last time Which is where it was when you went into the mausoleum the first time I was afraid you were gonna say that What are you at? I'm at 19 with a breaking point of 18. I'm always like destined to Snap every time we wake up in here So I'm gonna give you 2d 20 unnatural for what you learned in the last go-around About the unnatural dope dope dope. So roll them up Luke what'd you get a 15 and a 7 ooh? 22 on top of what did you have before? 28 so I'm at 50. That's it's a lot maybe yeah. All right. I've done what I did. So here we are I mean I can reroll No, I like it wouldn't work. I said things and now they're they're happening Joe. What do we get? I got a 13 and a 6 that gives me 19 added on to a 30 makes it 49, right? Right there with you, bud. Oh and Thomas took his webcam off To show us his role because 17 and 11. Is that an 11 making up for last time? Yeah, it's a 77 17 and 11 so 28 on top of what did you have last time? 16 16 so coming in hot with 44 well done. So a reminder. We're all very unnatural now reminder You can use that skill at any time But if you fail on the roll, you're gonna take a 1d6 sanity check not a check a hit But you still get good stuff even from a fail. That is true. That is my favorite mechanic of the unnatural Okay, I want to peek out of the mausoleum. Do I see that old lady still? No, when you peek out you do not see the old lady there but Jumping back into the character sheet and the mechanics for one quick second Basically in Delta green and rules is written when you go on a mission and you finish the mission There are these like qualifiers that basically say like you gain this much sanity if you complete this task and so I'm gonna give you guys a D10 of sanity shit for killing Marvin glass hell, yeah, the knowledge that that entity is No longer is worth 10 sanity You got one I roll the fucking one I Need so bad Thomas The webcam and roll the 10 Wowzers live. Yeah, I got a 60 so right in the mid there So we're getting this for having killed Marvin glass. Are we is there nothing for the last arc? So that was just his first you lose whatever you just rolled. Yeah last one. Well, we killed we killed Um, well, no, he killed himself didn't he Bruce Robin like that was our Ostensibly our mission our actions caused him to die. So that should be worth So if you guys could argue that like why would killing Bruce Robin like why would that help you mentally? Oh Yeah Yeah, cuz you gave you gave us this cuz killing Marvin Felt like a way right or as maybe killing Bruce Bruce killing himself in front of you. Did that feel like a win? No, I was that didn't mean to sound like such a dick Did you guys like that Sorry, but yeah, no if nothing about that entire arc made you feel like better about the situation Then probably not Yeah But the Marvin thing was cool Hey, you got one at least better than what you had Yeah, Bruce Robin was a ruthless Capitalist who prayed on on the lower half of society to to harvest as well However, he had just recently made a pretty big statement by giving all of his employees Vacation time while he worked diligently to make all of his companies Better for the employees. So with with higher pay and some people were saying that yeah, I don't know He reminded me of my brother and I hated my brother. So him dying made me feel even better I Was just like every lost human soul makes me gain sanity Yeah, is that still a thing though? I thought we were done with all our so Yeah, we are gonna pull a clean slate on any phobias or manias Starting up into this. However, when you hit those breaking points, you will be receiving new manias and phobias and I just It's gonna happen and I don't want you to stack them So, how about that and we back and we back and we back so Keith goes and looks out the out the mausoleum And does not see the woman in the wheelchair and when you see the placement of the Sun It is later than it was last time. What's your watch say Clark? It says three three, it says 3 p.m. Which if you remember, I believe last time we woke up in here It was one I think. Yeah, Zach's holding up a one finger Yeah, it was one o'clock didn't we want to do something that I want to say for previously we thought about Hunkering down and just waiting for us to see Planet juggernaut pop out of the ground and then we would go into Marvin's lair so that we could retrieve the gun Back from him and maybe the camera also is the camera with Marvin right now, right? Yeah so I look in the direction where I think the pit is is there any kind of chaos on the city skyline from that direction when you guys walk out you walk into a Pretty chilly December 6th at 3 p.m The Sun is lower in the sky than it was the last time you're out here with these three dead men quote-unquote men in black tactical gear At your feet and a crawfish boil still going still pretty hot hot fire It hasn't gone out yet looking out you notice that there maybe should be an old woman in a wheelchair But it is quite a bit later. She was moving slow, but maybe not that slow She's had time to scoot away by now at least out of this area for sure Yeah Or it's hopefully someone's come to help her one would assume unless her family abandoned her at the funeral of Ari Manstein that'd be sad Only you have the power to decide if this world gets that sad Zach It's really not a choice It's just what happens it happens every day open your If you're not angry you're not paying attention Thomas guys what what time did we fight planet juggernaut? Okay, if we if we popped out of the mausoleum at like one o'clock well It was one o'clock the last one or the one before that it's three o'clock right now. It was one o'clock Both times previously 11 a.m.. Then 1 o'clock then 3 o'clock. Oh, I see a pattern here so if we popped out at 11 for our Excursion into Marvin's base. I don't know how long were we there were we there for I mean We did quite a bit you went to Jim Cook's house, then you went to get weapons Maybe and then you went to the glass compound we fought the fish men We were knocked unconscious for a certain amount of time while we waited and there was like a waiting room Before we fought planet juggernaut, so we don't exactly know how long we were out for either So I guess the best guess is that it's like late tonight is when planet juggernaut would pop That's what I would say or early tomorrow morning even I don't know we would we would remember if it was if the Sun was Up when we popped out. Can you tell us that oh the Sun was not up so it was within 24 hours from now hopefully unless we were knocked out for days before we But that would be hopefully not don't you guys know everything in this show happens like very quickly no So as I'm looking out for the old lady and scratching my foot. I realized that Maggie is exed out Guys that just leaves true until D. Do you do you think we should go back to contention? That's the last place that we know that we saw drew right anybody see him I haven't seen him since contention and then Tildy is uh Well, I think we're gonna need the gun for that one. Oh, you're right So we need to wait around until we can get our hands on that gun and camera if our luck holds out We could do drew now and then Next time we wake up in the mausoleum. It'll be later. It should be five o'clock I don't know that opens up the possibility that we'll have to kill ourselves to reset ourselves And I don't know if I want to live with that on my mind for a while if the time comes I will kill you both. There we go. What happens if we don't reset this time? What have you got to live for now besides saving the world I mean dying just isn't always like the first thing I want to do just don't die then but then we won't reset It's like Douglas Adams or Shel Silverstein said flying is just Fine is just well what Tim McGraw said all day. I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying So, let's go do it eight seconds later, I need you to roll alertness someone I got 60 I got a 70 I also have 60 I rolled a 16 I pass out of the corner of your eye you hear a smell and it's familiar and What color is it bright yellow and? You get the feeling That creature that visited you asking about the book Is nearby or will be here in a second and you need to act right now? What do you do I tell the guy I tell the guys Do you remember that thing that thing that the thing that screamed at me and it was asking for a book I think it's coming back. I think it's coming back. We got it. We got to get out of here. Let's go Let's sprint to our car. Oh shit. Do we have cars? We might not have cars our old selves might have taken our car We took the cruiser last time I think or did we take the Accord? No, we took the car that Maggie brought us, right? So there should still be a cruiser here right or my car we can steal a car if needs be We had two cars here last time and we only took one of them. Who's got the lowest. Hold on. Let me call Enterprise Am I wrong? Yeah, there were three cars in total one that Maggie brought one that I drove there and one that you drew Yeah, and last time we all took one together Maggie went somewhere else So last time you left zero cars in the parking lot Well, how many cars are there now? That's that is to be decided when you get to the parking lot I suppose so you're saying that we took two cars I think we all took one car the first time you left the cemetery you took the cruiser and the second time you left the Cemetery you took the car that Clark came in Okay, so okay and that makes John Road with Rosemary, right? Okay, so if we go to the parking lot, what do we see? Well Were you guys all trying to decide in that moment if you should go to the parking lot? Because you didn't know whether there was a car there. Unfortunately due to our dithering. I think we I Guess we could say it was in character, but I told you guys like we needed to go so I figured we were going Yeah, yeah, but then we just sat around on our asses talking about whether or not there were cars there I feel like Joe Luke and Thomas did that. I don't know if we would have done that in character We would I said run so I feel like we would have run for Keith and character who says run I start running towards I Think that there's still a car there. So sure. Yeah As you guys are running through these tombs these above-ground mausoleums You need to make a couple quick turns to get out in the fastest way to the parking lot that you know And as you're running you see right in front of you There's an old woman in a wheelchair and she looks at you with massive eyes and she's just like And she starts crying out for help I take her with I get behind her wheelchair and start running her towards the parking lot. You gotta come with us, ma'am We'll get you out of here amazing and right behind you as you guys are nearing the turn for the parking lot you hear this like And if you look back while you're running you see that materializing behind you and not in your way is this Massive gaunt creature wearing a black suit and it has no snow hair whatsoever On its head If you could see its knuckles, there's no hair on its knuckles Certainly, no eyebrows. How about down there any down there? You can't see the down there, but you Looking at the rest of this from the rest of it might assume that it is both hairless and that You would be unaware of what its genitalia could look like Kendall It could be anything. I mean it's got a Ken doll down there Like just the smooth taint. Oh, I thought you meant like it's smooth, but there's a kindle attached to the front Just like stuck on there that would that would be dope and you guys are running but then this thing's behind you and it cries Out what do its eyes look like? Its eyes are slits That when they open they open from the bottom instead of from the top and when they like slap down onto its cheeks You see big big eyes that are The pupils are red and the part that is white on humans is also white I Hand the old lady my gun and I'm like you ever used one of these boy howdy she's gonna roll sanity She rolled a 77 oh Hell yes. Oh, that's bad properly. No, this old lady's got it together. She she has 85 sanity Oh sweet, so it's a critical success. So she cocks the gun. Yeah. Oh Interesting, so she cut I was using these before you were born She's instantly on board with this Justin come on in we just got our new tank ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, let's call it Hey tell Justin get in here and play an old lady She Cocks the gun immediately and I just wanted to provide cover fire over our shoulders And when you make it out into the parking lot you see that there are No cars here in this parking lot Until a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse comes flying Across all the designated parking spots in this parking lot toward you Who's in it? Is it baby driver and behind the wheel you can see drew Andrews Now Unfortunately, I've never been so excited. I need you all the real power Shit That's gonna be a no from me dog, I rolled over my power same 79 on a 50 67 on a 60 87 on a six. I rolled the 22 Fuck you Unless that's good then. Hell yeah drew had an 11 sanity. So he also critically feels You all here. Hello subject Clark Theodore Bishop and you all Freeze You all turn around even all of John Lee Kevin Moore with all of the wheelchair just spins you around like you're standing on a Platform I am here to offer apologies and to put your minds to rest Order has not been lost, but we ran into a glitch Surrounding a vector with the same genetic code as Clark Theodore Bishop But Clark Theodore Bishop does not have a twin. This is the glitch. I am here to investigate subject Clark Theodore Bishop Subject John Lee petty more the third subject Ashley Keith beans What can you tell me about this vector? Your name is Ashley my face gets super red I'm like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about Oh That's something I shoot I shoot at him I get super mad super flustered and I shoot at him that's in line That's what you did last time All right, yeah, I go ahead and roll power again because you'll have to win a contest of power Fucking hell dude, what'd you get? I'm rolling rocks. I rolled a 33 Oh I got an eight. I'm sorry Keith Vigna as you pull the gun out You hold it like you're aimed ready to fire and your finger will not pull the trigger. I Need you to roll sanity. I Got a 99 Oh So, yeah days over my power, yes, I believe it is oh dang it looks like I wasn't recording I guess we got to start Dang Restart checkpoint You guys all just pull guns on each other. See come back at five. Thanks Thanks for clueing us into our strategy my finger won't move when I try to fire it and I look at I look at the old lady Why are you doing this to me? She won't let me shoot him and I look panicked at my two friends, but also Suspiciously, you've got to respect your elders and I'm sure she has her reasons But also have you considered that it's the weird Future man doing it. Yeah, I'm with John on this one Keith. I think that it's the tall guy over there. That's making us Maybe you don't want me to shoot him I mean I that's also true at this moment you realize that none of your mouths have been moving and you've been having this conversation Mentally, I Need you guys to roll. I'm sorry tall guy. Did you just hear all that? Oh 94 97 oh boy. What are we rolling? I need Joe and Thomas Clark and John both lose one sanity However, Keith Vigna with that critical failure You're also gonna lose one sanity Cool, because you lose the maximum sanity, which is one for that Well, okay, so I had that buffer of one so I don't break right now. Oh nice Yeah, and hold on for just one scene longer and as you guys realize that you were having this conversation mentally oh wait That was a sanity roll and I rolled over my yes, you did same I don't know if okay You'll have to explain how what kind of hold this creature has on me because I might not be able to do it's got a hold Enough to where you won't be able to do anything So just describe what it looks like when you try to do what you want to do But you can't do what you want to do. I feel like this happened before Discribed it as yeah, I just kind of boil from the inside You see my face turn red and like sheer rage over my face It's physically hurting me from the inside out that I can't do anything Meanwhile Kevin is freaking out picks his can he move his body just like minutely Well, then you can tell that if he could move his body He would be freaking out But every part of him is like twitching super tense muscles and the most concerned look comes across his face And you hear him thinking this ain't right. This ain't me This ain't me, I ain't no fortunate son. It ain't me As you're all essentially just like in suspended motion This thing thinks toward you and you feel release and relief in Your bones you can feel it reverberate. Do not do not be afraid Do not be afraid Hey, hey, I'm not a family on the shore I'm giving you relief here. Welcome to fucking welcome to fucking welcome to the fucking show kids And as you're all calm you see this woman for the first time maybe Ever that you've seen this woman because every single time you've come across her she is looked so worried So afraid almost like on the verge of death with how stressed out she is and you see her immediately come to peace and in that moment she just exhales and Freezes I try to take the gun from her hand. Her hand is kind of stuck to it a little bit. I pry her Frozen fingers off just because the bad circulation I Snap No, but yeah, so I Struggle with the gun for a little bit that rested from her frozen hand and and you have it I don't know why you would need a gun in your hand with how relaxed and chill you are right now as this thing's Like what? Can you tell me about this vector and you hear a screech behind you as Drew whips this red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse right up behind you guys and drew looks And he sees this creature looking at you and he slowly starts Driving in reverse, but just really slowly He goes about 20 yards and then he just stops and he's just watching I try to beam the thought to drew run him down Run them over you need not have those Aggressions we are in time of peace I will tell you what will help you if you will help me Clark's ears perk up at that for sure What what do you need and what can you offer? I am looking for information about a glitch in regards to subject Clark Theodore Bishop This glitch is not a twin but has the same genetic makeup I can't help but notice that you've abandoned the numbers format that you were using last time We saw you are you are you the same thing that we saw last time? I am four three six two nine I wanted to make sure that you are more comfortable DC FBI is what it was I've been I've been through some stuff. I know those numbers now you does that does that mean your DC FBI? Is that is that what those numbers mean? We are We are I thought you were going to continue We are blah blah blah blah D DC FBI does that is is that the kind of like is that District of Columbia Federal Bureau of Investigation. Is that what that stands for? So here's a thing I need you all the real power Three Ooh a 25 I pass I got a 40 on a 50. Holy shit. We all passed God, okay. Yeah, and I failed. Yeah, look how the table and so That will be important here in a second District of Columbia your nation's capital. What's up with your voice? This is the voice that I have to communicate with What a different voice make you more comfortable. I guess Physically, what are you? I am NOT like you that is apparent and you know that I'm not trying to other eyes you in any Way, but are you like a future man, or are you some kind of space creature? I am simply better That's an opinion it is not it is fact I am here to begin. Oh I thought there was more again Again begin what we are myriad and we are here to advance. Oh You stuff in there again. Okay. Gotcha Clark says to the fellas Myriad you you remember myriad it's that's the we saw that symbol. It's the double helices and we saw the robot man at James the mill workers house had that on his crotch and There was a ring that Keith are you do you still have that ring around my neck? I have the ring on a my shoestring show him that ring. I guess yeah, I hold it up Actually, I want to put it on. Can I can I move? Yes. Okay, I put it on my right ring finger And hold it out to him.

Hello subject Ashley Keith beans Why do you have this? Ring I've always had it roll power 25 on a 50 Failed you have always had it for a while. Obviously, that's just Jim cook in the body of Keith beans Yeah subject Jim James cook you are still alive. This is excellent news I Whisper in Keith's ear. Why don't you tell him that we're your friends and you need him to restate your primary mission To brief us on what's going on. I look at the thing. Did you catch that? I am sorry what he said can you I Need you to restate my mission to make sure that you're who you say you are I Bubble gum tree Does that work Subject Jim James cook before your death you were working on operation stapler Android program Respect to cut down on cost and sell to private companies like the city asylum Are you still working on this? I approach the creature and get really close to it I don't know if these guys Know about that yet. So But yeah Then why did you ask me to state your brief loudly I didn't say loudly. I only talk in one volume Well, as long as they can know we're good to go. They're they're helping me out here I assumed when you asked that they were not our enemy. Yeah, I'm still working on it Just to make sure I can trust you. What is project stapler again?

Hey Keith. I'm I mean a Jim will you ask this thing if it's a robot? Is this a robot? You're not a robot Are you I am NOT a robot, but you're an Android Why would you assume that I am either robot or Android I am neither So you're an alien I am from where I am from which is I do not know So, how do you know you're neither robot nor Android nor alien? I am alone Technically in your definitions an alien, that's awesome, man That's really cool. Well, so yeah, Jim Jim's just plugging away there At that at that project stapler Yeah, I ran into a little bit of a mix-up with my old body in this one But uh, tell me more about the vector We are on the same team and you are working with subject Clark Theodore Bishop Please tell me more about the vector. What do you want to know? It just seems to be a little time-traveling thing Yes. Yeah, nothing too big Hey, maybe we'll tell you a little bit more about the vector if you can tell us about operation three ring binder and hole puncher and hole puncher Little whisper thing that he does every now and then does that sound like speech it sounds like yeah He's communicating with some sort of speech some sort of uplink Okay, when I showed him the ring did it like glow or do anything? No, I Am unfamiliar with operation hole puncher or operation three ring binder And I he meant that or is he know and that yeah, can I he meant it as well? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Go ahead and roll him it Fail 76 on a 50. I got a 75 on a 80 75 on an 80 would tell you you are not exactly familiar with non-human intelligence, however If you were guessing You would say that it didn't talk differently So it's either been lying the whole time or telling the truth the whole time Probably sounds like a real straight shooter Clark is gonna address the creature Can you can you tell us how you how you and Jim are related? What how do you guys know each other? Jim here works for myriad. How long has he been doing that? How long has he been with myriad? Why do you do not know things about him he is right here I'm Jim is just a real hard guy to get to open up and we've been working with him for a while and we you know One of subject Jim James Cook's best qualities is his inability to open up. So you understand so we just you know, we we really come to appreciate the feller and Well, we just want to know a little bit more about him. So maybe on his birthday we can do something special You know with with a personal touch what have you done on his previous birthdays? Well, he hasn't told us when it is so we'd like to do something at all Jim cook I gotta make that shorter some I'll speed it up in post just replace it with modem sounds Hahahaha Subject Jim James Cook does the same thing on his birthday Every birthday for the past decade on his birthday December 1st, he always goes to his favorite pie shop in the city called Prairie pie, but it's like Prairie pie. Yes And It's yeah, it's two folded hands on the outside in a triangle making that's like a pie slice We have a local pie maker in Springfield called Prairie pie like on the Prairie like home and It's the best pie. Anyway, I have a piece of the honey sea salt in my fridge right now every December 1st Subject Jim James Cook's birthday He goes to Prairie pie in the city before walking back home I walk back home to contention. No Jim lives in the city Oh, yeah What do you know in exchange for this information to make subject Jim James Cook's birthday better now? We know to get him pie. What do you know about the vector? Oh Nothing really during my mishap when I had to switch bodies I a lot of info got kind of a Jar-bolt around my head. I there's some things I just don't remember Subject Jim James Cook Are you in the body of subject Ashley Keith beans in order to repair the relationship regarding? operation San Ferra blum Yes Precisely Clark nudges Keith Like I don't I can't do it without him hearing so I just nudge you after you say just yes And you stop talking. I nudge you well, how do you suggest we move forward Jim? You don't you don't remember very much about that mission. Do you you should have him remind you what it is? Yeah Yeah, no, I mean Jim obviously remembers it pretty well But what he did say is before he made a move he wanted to consult with us tactically But yeah, you did want you to fill us in on that right? Yeah that way they know So we yeah really if subject just James is taken care of I suppose We can move forward in what way sorry we're playing catch-up Will you describe who subject just James is to us? I mean out of character. Do you know yeah? It's James the mill worker that's why we've called him James the mill worker forever cuz he's just James I am curious I will give you information about Operation San Ferra blum if you will first give me information about the vector Clark Clark's gonna step forward toward it. Do you do you know you called it a glitch earlier? Do you would you have a running theory on what this new vector is? I'm gonna be straight with you a scary man that we don't exactly know for sure We've got our own theories. Do you have a theory our working theory is a clone? Yeah, I mean I guess that the clones old though, so wouldn't this one be the clone we've seen We've seen this vector that I believe you're speaking of and it looks like me But it seems like an older version of me is it helping or hurting I? Like to think it's helping it seems it seems helpful so far seems more healthy than hurting does it seem to have an agenda Yeah Yes, yes, it does. What is this agenda? It's cryptic to say the to say the least yeah that remains unclear Where was this vector seen last from your perspective? I point behind it Yeah, I point at the mausoleum. It was You get he I was in there Oh, we're calling him Clark old Clark old was in in there And then and then he wasn't he he doesn't he disappeared on us. What time? 11 or that's when we woke up so like 9 or 10, maybe yeah, thank you I have decided many things during our conversation one Subject Ashley Keith beans you are not subject Jim James cook number two Just wait a minute there you all are clearly working in a way that you do not understand What your causalities are creating in this time? I need for this reason too, and I am sorry wipe your memories And it reaches out its hand I pull my gun out and try to shoot it so here Let's think about what happens this thing reaches out its arm as Keith Vigna pulls out his gun you see it like struggling as We rolled the power check earlier And you all succeeded it thinks that it succeeded and leaves it has Completed its task and it disappears out of existence But you all remember everything tight holy shit, and it went in a way different way than I expected it to Yeah, we pumped that alien all his information and as you guys turn around and I'm singing like a canary Let's go kill Tildy does Sam Farah bloom mean anything to you guys I? Don't think it. No. I don't have no idea If I google it does anything come up go ahead and roll computer 87 on a 20 No when you google Sam Farah bomb nothing comes up. I spell it wrong I'd like to try as well Fuck 60 other Clark doesn't have any computer skill zero percent zero percent that makes sense yep. That was my design Clark only uses his phone to text and just barely gets through it You Hear the car pull up right behind you it scares me, so I aim my gun at Drew For just a second until I realize who it is Clark tries to like no no no Throw a hand onto the gun to put it down to the ground. No. It's it's Keith. It's true. It's true Look, it's true is the old lady still here in the wheelchair. There is a woman's body Is it alive body? Why why did you say that Zach? Is it is she dead? When she finally Finally for the first time in over a decade had no pain and no fear in her heart and in her mind She felt ready to go Did she die fuck we killed her December 6 we have no way of knowing that so we're Holy shit that that alien must have scared her death Oh, maybe he did something terrible to her mind drew pulls up in the 2001 red Mitsubishi Eclipse rolls down the window Hello contention police officers, please get in the car and come with me. Oh boy. It is good to see you drew What's contention like true?
