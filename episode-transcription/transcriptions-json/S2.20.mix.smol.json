Confidently, there are other people here at the station. So on the way there Beck I'm gonna need a grip check for you for the attire of some of your co-workers that you're passing through the hall I pass 35 and a 49 nice So you see you start to see these flashes as these people approach and how do you like contain yourself? It's a head down looking at the feet Like like somebody who is trying to be as inconspicuous as possible and just get through this hallway to the other end And you've been through these hallways time after time in the morning and you pass through the same way you always head to the can security office and as you guys pass in you See that's on shift today is ray.

We might even want to go to at this point Okay, let's take a double and he goes to two times speed pushes it through and we see Vivica sneaking back into the city action news station after you all have left looking over her shoulder the whole way through as she Crosses into the foyer. She digs deep into her pocket. She pulls out this thumb drive And there's this determined look in her not grainy face because it's pretty decent quality This quality is amazing even five years ago She would have been grainy as fuck and then she puts the thumb drive back in her pocket It shows it in there and heads back into the editing Bay surely in your minds to delete the footage or at least take it What was my character's name when we played with? Can I say the name and don't has it has it been played already? No, it hasn't come out yet her name is What's up? What was my guy's name? He owned a security company. So you see the the security system is made We just looked it up. What's who's the security system made by Vincente boring? Yeah, so it's the security system called like Yeah, it's on there yeah, you'll have to wait to hear Luke's character who chokes every line out Oh, wow, this is the best security system in the whole city. I Actually had these people install some security in my home and both my my Peabody and three local Emmys were stolen in that time. I Ended up going with Shakira toss. Well for your home, you should go with a ring doorbell Target oh, I do have a ring doorbell found a target but for for the office, it's a fun story We actually used it to some effect earlier to see Stevie running away from my basement with her brother. That's that's right I remember on that beautiful ring doorbell crystal-clear picture every time hold on. Hold on I could see the shame on her face. That was a present from my daughter She gave me a gift receipt in case I didn't want it that gift receipt was to a store called Target, huh? That's it. That's it. It was Target. Hmm. I love shopping in Target for all my holiday needs I I got you and back such wonderful presents two individuals walk through the doors Are they revolving doors into the can station? Why not? I can't yeah, of course feels like they are the old west saloon doors one of these individuals The can piano players I Immediately slumps over two individuals walk through the front door of the can station one is tall Mousey is wearing glasses and the other one is short jacked and bald They walk forward scoping out one takes the left side one takes the right side They're looking through the windows on either side. They see the editing Bay you follow them they head into the editing Bay Ray-ray, you remember every face that's coming in out of here, don't you? We can zoom enhance zoom and enhance we zoom in enhance you can do that on boring security cameras We pull back we zoom out to see these two as they walk in once again and zoom in on their faces and Something it's weird. It's like Something that they're wearing maybe seems to be obvious skating their face It's like it's too well lit like pauperizing around their shirt paparazzi clothes Paparazzi stuffs like the anti-paparazzi shirts. Can I roll to see if Julius would like associate that with? Fuck, what is the bet? Well, who are the bad guys bad guys? Got a little girl. I don't know. Does it look like God all Corp close gottel tech gottel that some gottel tech That total does it look like any of the gottel clothing we've seen no, no, no, I mean it's not gottel tech I mean, uh, well Sharon I spent Several weeks together in the in the mid 80s and and she employed a similar device against the paparazzo I bet you wish you could turn back time, dude I'm sorry. What you know like never mind mamma Mia Oh Yes, mamma Mia Abba share was in the mamma Mia sequel Mamma Mia 2 here we go again mamma Mia 2 look who's talking now Ray Ray It's it's hard to see their faces But it's like they're wearing some sort of mask have you have you ever seen anything like this or seen them before? Oh I heard about it on the internet. I heard about what on the internet. It's kind of like clothes That okay. Yes. I mean, I'm familiar. What would you google? anti face Camera, can you zoom into the car that they arrived in? Anti face camera Shirt Go ahead and zoom into the car that they came in He whips around with the digital analog knob and shows that they head into the editing bay They're in there for a couple minutes They leave the editing bay just the two of them as they're walking out one does a classic like Flicks the thumb drive in the air off their thumb. It makes a noise. Oh And Catches it throws it back in the pocket they head back out to their police car the external camera on the building looks out and you see that this is CPD number eight three six. Oh, come on Is it TC I read the spoilers discord I should have asked you what number it was Is it a Is it a city police car or contingent police car ooh interesting question, I don't know what contingent is this is season two It's a city police car. We need to find out who that police car is registered to which which officers How do you even do that Beck can do that? I mean I can I can sort of do that but like I'm not a reporter like It seems like you guys would know more about how to like investigate things Is there another way you could figure out like a way to follow them? What's that? I know that that the the Bori security company runs almost all the security around here Maybe if we call one of the higher-ups we can get access to the buildings around us I have a couple of trusted contacts in the city police force They might be able to look these badge numbers up for me this car number Yeah I think that'd be the way to go just like see if they have like who was driving the car Just like that alone would get us on the right track sick. Yeah Let's go to the giant phone in the can offices the red phone that goes straight to the police. Yeah No, no, that's that's Too obvious my contacts in the CPD prefer me to contact them more discreetly Is it like a like a secret drop situation are we doing like by stuff yes, it's very cool. Oh shit Yeah, it's very fun. I mean, it's not so like we do talk face-to-face, but there is an elaborate and Fairly pointless system of message drops and exchanges before that process can begin Are we gonna like put an X on a window Julius is googling the Bori security company hotline? Everyone roll on Intelligence or Bureaucracy 18 on the 75 I pass an intelligence role Yeah, they're ring System I'll try to do that again at Target God I went to Target the other day Classic thing where you go in for one thing and the deals are so hot you end up just You get your whole week's worth of stuff That they have at the front. I just like one dollar two dollars three dollars five Yeah, and I know before Thanksgiving. I bought a stuffed felt turkey there I'm gonna go back to Target and try to find myself a reindeer in that little front section Do you think maybe stop by this? Maybe stop by the Starbucks that's always at the front of the target I kind of feel like everything in that front section has been felt. This is crazy You bought a stuffed turkey I bought a real strict like turkey and they're extensive grocery section Wow Yeah, that is crazy. Well, and I didn't know where I was gonna get a turkey and a ham for Christmas But at Target they have it and you should go to Target if you check on Target's website. They have recipes for holiday meals late lunch time late lunch alert and you see that Thai shitty son Raymond pulls his phone back out of his pocket and he's like Deborah over traffic hit me up for that lunch time Me and Deborah from traffic over here at City Action News are gonna head out to lunch So you guys can have at this but like whatever this feels like an everybody loves Raymond joke But I don't know enough about that show to know if it's accurate What a good show Yeah, I had a real good dog named Murphy he used to sound like he was on everybody loves Raymond I passed my intelligence. So did I yes in me three successes and when Raymond brings up the debt Oh my god. I just got that. I just understood the jerk Raymond and Deborah. Yep. This is this is me. I'm Zach. What's up? It's nuts how brands work it's like two people who are so in some way like have a relationship that sounds good As as Raymond starts talking about having lunch with Deborah from traffic at City Action News you think Julius puts his phone down realizing. I don't want to talk to the boring hotline We can just use the traffic cameras and Cal has already texted his contact. How's the weather? You immediately get a text back this is Beck gets a text it says, how's the weather? It's you don't even have to be old to make a mistake like that like hey, you don't have to be that old Oh Cal it looks like you texted me. It's it's it's fine. The weather's fine. And but I think that this was probably for fuck anyway Yes, yes, yes, he scrolls down like several bees and gets to his contact How's the weather I You do you get a text back that says stormy something's brewing we need to be at City Park at 3 15 p.m It's like three right now. Oh Shit Cal we're not gonna make it You need to drive the can van like you've never driven it before or my sweet Mercedes. Whatever we took here. I I Listen we'll take my Mercedes I get out of tickets all the time Can I search the security like for like one of the like little red lights you can put on top of a car? Yeah, go ahead and roll search That's past 47 on a 70 you find a little red topper That's got a siren on the top that's got audio and visual aids and siren Let's get it Well said On the way to the can van Julius is going to hook his phone up via bluetooth to this Oh, you guys are out. You guys are out. You're in the can van.

That's smart Cal is like cows eyes are wide and he's speeding down like one of the main city like thoroughfares He's laughing and he turns to you guys. It was like, where are we going again? You said the park it was it was you Cal we were following your lead. That's right. He takes a sudden And Through the gates of the city park we see etched no not etched rot in iron I Got tingles Cow cow like sheds a single tear as he passes under the gates and thinks about like the brave like proud working men of the city who rot 120 years ago twisted it says The city park. I Love this goddamn city rolling through you see on either side of you trees Must have been why don't laugh right away. I must have been why? That's I don't know you see trees must have been planted here must have been 30 of the fuckers Must have been purposely planted here at least a hundred two hundred years ago Massive trees lining the roads on either side as you curve and make your way through this park You see picnic tables. You see ponds you see fountains You see a little boathouse where a dock has paddle boats the happy couples and families and Rangers There's a medical NPC and there's a long Green dawn on either side past the the medical person there That's adjacent to the pond Of course and the big green lawn stretch is up in a hill sort of fashion up to the top where there is a large statue of an old military general on a horse in front of a Massive building with columns in front of it major general means major gentle means major general beans major general And you know for that guy he looks like a cop You see a police officer on a bike in front of you is that our guy no hit him Where Are you meeting your contact probably under the major general being statue where you can also access the docks to one of the myriad ponds And there's there's some like duck boats that you can paddle as you pass the police officer that's on a bicycle He gives you a kind of stink eye as you head into the the double lanes you as you pass the bicycle It's the appropriate way to pass someone on a bicycle mind you but he gets a kind of hair Tingles up on the back of his neck and then decides. I don't really want to do anything right now Cal is cows in a you know cows in an odd mood these past few days But he chuckles and he says don't worry boys. We're off to meet that those bosses boss damn Cal That's only two rings up Guys still makes coffee Julius through the speaker on the roof of the car just says oops Sorry Yeah, I didn't take into account the siren on the top of your car. Did I know that guy was an idiot Let's go meet our man. Let's go meet this man as you approach the statue at the top of this hill There's like a circle drive around it and Cal pulls the Mercedes over He kind of looks over it back in the passenger seat looks it was starting to get the camera out looks at Julius and the in the back and he says um Unfortunately, there's only room for two on the on the goose paddle boats, but could you follow discreetly behind me? Yeah, hey Cal is it cool if I mic you up very cool back Also, give me one of your tik-tok phones and I could Hide it in my pocket square and and lean towards Julius gives him his tik-tok phone And Julius is stoked because he knows that he can paddle the shit out of these boats with his fucking huge legs Discreetly but you could pull alongside us at some distance and zoom in. Oh, yeah with the audio You're mostly gonna be going in circles though from what I can hear from Julius is gonna sit in the middle and paddle both That way back can straddling like the goose's neck Hey Cal I can you know, I can splash you if you want no, no, no, don't get too close. He'll know something is up Okay, okay Should we go first that would be best if you go before us? You could we'll get a good we'll get a good spot your pace and advantage you behind that's much easier than trying to I'll get A lot of footage of like the trees and stuff. So it looks like we're just tourists making making videos They do call you the b-roll bastard. I Was hoping that was gonna catch on fuck. Yeah. Oh, did you start that back? Yeah, that's a good one. It's working It's yeah, I heard it from like I heard it from a couple people. Oh, yeah That doesn't usually work great job back as you're buying the admission tickets to hop on Julie you think about curious cow Curious cow I like it. That sounds a little weird Don't spread that one I'll think on it Julius flashes his season pass which allows a guest We Have your boat waiting for you right here, mr. Summers it It's a goose with sunglasses on and on the side it's gilded it says summers Which it I turn on to work against my legs and this is my I Let's go will you be having the regular with it today make it the VIP right away, sir and as you guys are getting on the Spectacle goose a platter arrives and is sat down in front of you. It's got a top on it. Would you do the honors Beck? Yeah, man. Do you like do this a lot as he pulls up the Julius just slaps his thighs and kind of like duh So I'm thinking it's just protein it's a Like one of those like muscle powder like shaker things And then like a charcuterie board, but it's mostly it's like two full summer sausages Plus like four ounces of vodka Like a big Slim Jim just snaps into One of the summer sausages Beck you better hold on. Yeah. Oh, yeah, and I'm kind of I'm doing what we said just kind of holding on for dear life Getting into a good angle and Julius flips the motor in reverse and starts pedaling forward quickly And You guys make your way out into the middle of this pond He's like make it like creating like a wake making you awake out to yeah, like it's like bouncing. It's bouncing the other bird All right, so the two of you are out there in the water and Cal Cal Cal is approaching his contact who is in like a classic kind of trench coat Yes, of course any any taps is he taps his lapel and it's like a back. Can you hear me? And we've got we've got our headphones Doesn't zoom just like goes to the focus of like the very obvious boat with these two with their boom I say to Julius I didn't set up a way for us to communicate with him Julius gives a big thumbs up That's funny for a minute and he turns around He gives you a big thumbs up too and approaches police chief McMillan Oh police chief McMillan who is a Broad-shouldered gentleman with a big ol walrus Mustache that is gray and salt and pepper. What's his head look like shiny? Yeah Yeah, very shiny since he's got a walrus stash. He has to be bald Haircut and a walrus mustache looks strange. Yeah, he's got he's got these crazy like schoolboy locks Like fifties, yeah, but his but his mustache is is is more gray than red But it still twitches weirdly like a walruses almost like whiskers Mr. Colorado was a pleasure back. I can see that guy sweating from over here Mac are you okay? What I don't get out on the boat, oh, yes, I definitely agree By the way, this is a two-party consent state, so I Just need to tell you this conversation is being recorded is this normal for the two of you This is abnormal but in real life It might not be abnormal if you just always guaranteed him that he was on what I think it's called deep cover or deep background That they on background on background. Is that what it is? Can't be quoted Background is but you are deep back your deep background. You can't be quoted in It like is very meaningful hello, mr. X You're on deep background.

So there's no issue with the with the transcription. Yes, of course Thank you That was as best as I could do that was very good for me Back I think this guy's having a stroke He keeps shaking his head as he talks, I think that might be the issue sweat is just flying off of him I'm very nervous cow Mac. You're my best source. I need to know about two of your officers. He Walks, he looks at you with that big mustache. He walks off the side of the goose boat that we're battling We've got a goose but not a swan boat It's a little uglier Ours has sunglasses on so it's inconspicuous On the eyes Let's damn got always button to us that's that's what I want to know or do you do you have reason to believe and it? Seems that you do that. Some of your rank are perhaps compromised by the gaudel Corp Never come percentage about I've never Mocking you Speak clearly man, you know, I know your father got you this job, but it's time to show some spine City is in danger Persuader bureaucracy or laws is a 20 year old kid Have no fucking clue where my dice is While you're rolling Julius you receive a text from tife Rayland your uncle and it reads Need to see you in my office Bring Beck and cow.

Who's a real cop and who's a cop? What percentage roughly would you say are cops? Mm-hmm Unfortunately, it's hard to tell these days, but I say it's somewhere between 15 and 25% this thick is a poison is poison That's going like a virus not poison unless a poison cause a poison that grows maybe a poison that grows Mac you may have just given us the name of the segment that wins the next Peabody Bob what's all in the name to get it all out and make sure that the good people of the city are being taken care Of and being watched over whether it's by the funny police department or the city.
