121.72 138.12 speaker0  Have I been to this bar before? Is one of my eyeballs made of metal? I don't wanna poke myself in the eye to find out, but well, sanity has its limits.

The town is quiet. A massive wall of water filled with fish surrounds the campus of the First Church of Contention. just repeatedly slapped Keith's dad's watch on wrist after wrist in an attempt to gain as much information as possible. Stan Manstein claimed.
289.96 327.56 speaker1  She was those things when she was a police officer. Silas Cole was a miner in the mine that employed the town nearby of contention. Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.
324.48 337.84 speaker0  Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,
335.40 352.04 speaker1  of the tall, skinny mining company building He began to harvest the residue and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.
349.12 403.18 speaker2  Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky substance into the town. To divert his raising paranoia, he began looking for a partner. in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance He became paranoid that other people could see the residue that was loose all over the town. Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him, so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much. the piano player, there's a few gamblers, the town drunk, so they kept their heads down and went about their business.
401.22 410.10 speaker1  But then some good people disappeared, a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,
406.46 446.94 speaker2  the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared. The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again. That was the history of contention, and our history is different. Mine is now definite.
444.54 520.46 speaker0  Keith heard the voice of Terrence Licker threateningly holler at Randy Anx from an idling truck about a block away. Keith has beef. Tea Licker owes him three fucking dollars. At Randy's, John found his cousin, Jimmy, a bit off his rocker in a truck bed that's been puddle-teamed, and Clark saw Randy through the window being held down by a man in cahoots with Terrence Licker. Keith just grabbed the keys delivering us now to a scene that puts the tension in contention. It's kudzu with no back bone.
518.10 576.18 speaker2  We are on episode 80. My name is Zach, and I am the one leading you through this adventure with my words, just painting pictures of scenes that you are then forced to see inside of your own mind, and helping me concoct these very, very logical and easy-to-follow stories are my three... ...e... We are three best friends, but we're not best friends with you. The three of us are best friends. He owns us, so we're his.
573.06 583.10 speaker4  No, but we've done, like, his three best friends. Yeah, exactly, is what we're trying to say,
581.02 588.62 speaker2  but every time we get together with you,
585.98 620.18 speaker4  You have to play in them, and it's like, God, Anyway, that's why you're not top three. so I don't want to share that.
617.74 629.30 speaker2  Tell me about your day. It rained today. It did rain all day.
626.02 632.30 speaker4  I had to wipe my dog's paws off when he came inside,
630.26 668.06 speaker2  I let my dog run around outside for an hour, and she rolled in mud. I said, you know what? Have your fun. I let Joe outside, but his feet were dry as fuck when he came back in. I do too. Sometimes you let me off the leash.
666.22 673.06 speaker4  On all fours.
668.06 702.70 speaker2  Yeah, but like smiling, like smile growling. get anything done. I'm having a difficult time focusing on anything. You guys, do you guys feel my, feel it?
700.38 706.96 speaker4  in the morning and then waking up after noon, quite a bit after noon?
706.14 710.34 speaker2  I have. That's how I tried.
707.80 739.70 speaker4  That was the first thing I tried, yeah. The cool thing that happens with me is that my sleep schedule seems to just like rotate throughout the week as if it's completely divorced So one day a week for sure I'll be up till five and then that kind of shifts. Sometimes I go to bed at 7 p.m. and then wake up at 5 a.m. and then other times it's the opposite.
736.60 779.20 speaker2  Yeah, my vices are pushing me basically like wholeheartedly at this point. They've taken the reins on when I sleep. So it's purely caffeine and weed, just like back and forth and back and forth until I am either awake and able to do stuff like freak out or asleep. I've been huffing paint to go to sleep. Congrats, man. I'm really proud of you. Glue. Paint Luke is a little edgy.
777.32 786.66 speaker4  You don't like my silver goatee?
784.64 792.36 speaker2  since Fairy Road came out, but it has been and that's what we're talking about for this whole hour
791.20 795.06 speaker4  Oh, that'd be fucking awesome.
793.20 800.12 speaker2  Half decade anniversary of one of the greatest action movies ever made. Damn.
799.00 802.00 speaker4  I saw it in IMAX.
800.12 807.00 speaker2  It blew my mind. I saw it three times in theaters.
805.32 822.44 speaker4  I saw it twice in theaters. The second time was someone who I dated for nearly two years, but I shouldn't have because at the start of our relationship we saw Fury Road and she was like, I fucking hated that.
820.94 831.56 speaker2  Yeah, you should have known to hop out right then and there, but if you had,
829.56 833.40 speaker4  Sorry and thanks.
831.56 860.40 speaker2  I can't imagine that she would much less make it 80 episodes. A, they're not gonna listen to it this far in and B, if they just decided to like listen to episode 80 for some reason, if they make it all the way through Wolf the Dog not knowing what the fuck is going on,
858.44 864.40 speaker4  that you wanna just say like fuck you two or like something bad about him?
861.24 926.86 speaker2  My dad, I love him so much that it's just like, you know when you love someone so much, Very much. Do you guys wanna play some role playing? I wanna hear more about the dads and the Bs. You fuck your dad and make a mom. are very tolerant, even encouraging of behavior far past that that is recognized as appropriate. Hold on, encouraging? Not when I'm in it all.
925.18 932.06 speaker4  to fuck your dad. In the pursuit of a mom.
930.22 1112.82 speaker2  Okay, so now that we're all on the same page. We're pro mom. As it says in Ecclesiastes 4.16. Yes. John Lee Pettymore the third is standing on the driveway of Randy Angst's home. He's staring into the bed of a truck that is made into a puddle that is teaming with fish and also not so much teaming, but consisting of a body that it belongs to Jimmy Sanders. However, the mind of Jimmy Sanders, it is unsure of whether or not he is still in there because he is not acting himself. When he saw John Lee Pettymore the third, he dove into this water around the side of the car, standing there with holding the keys. They were just in the ignition of this truck is Keith Vigna. And standing outside the side of the house, looking in the window is Clark Bishop. You notice that this man, this burly as fuck, five foot four, rocky sweat suit wearing motherfucker. You know him as Fade. It's a nickname. His name is Luca Fajevic, but everybody calls him Fade. Shout out. Luke was like, what'd you call me? one of our patrons who is at the $10 level, which is called the honorary police officers. And he submitted Luca Fade Fajevic as his MPC. Luca Fade Fajevic and Terrence Licker are standing over Randy Angst. And Randy Angst is face down in his own carpet wearing a fancy blue suit. And to the right of him, there's a cane. You'd remember that Randy Angst uses a cane to get around, so it's not necessarily great. You do see this cane next to him has a big Rubik's Cube on the top. Standing right behind Luca Fade Fajevic is T. Licker, Terrence Licker, famed beef-haver with Keith Bigna. Beef house. I smell like beef. We just need to get you on out there. We need bodies and you know we need them. And you know, if you want things to go back, if you want back to where it used to be, then you can have it, you know? but what I really mean is initiative. And therefore, we will begin as we always do with Clark Bishop. and therefore it should be Clark Bishop, then Keith Bigna, then John Lee Pettymore, I believe.
1110.22 1121.14 speaker4  but I think if I've annotated this right, that's minus 10 for my robot abilities, so 45. I'm at 60.
1119.56 1135.12 speaker2  at the beginning of any combat. And because I like to make things easy on myself, it always goes PCs, then NPCs, then back to the PCs. So you guys get to begin first.
1131.94 1165.46 speaker4  Do they look up and see me or where do they look? I assumed there was a back door on this place. I'm gonna try sneaking my way back to the back door. I wanna search the console and the truck and see if there's anything in there. Everything you have.
1163.50 1176.10 speaker3  but mostly I'm looking for money, specifically at least $3 and any weapons that might be in there.
1173.62 1186.98 speaker2  but there's no chance that there's money in there because that'll be so much more fun to role play out later. So if you're looking for weapons.
1185.44 1201.24 speaker4  I don't know, it'd be pretty fucking funny if Keith finds three bucks in that guy's center console
1199.18 1203.60 speaker2  That's what the bald man says, right?
1201.24 1223.04 speaker4  Yeah, zero, zero. If I roll a zero, that's a critical failure, right? That's 100? That's 100. I need to stop doing that. I know, I don't know.
1221.98 1229.06 speaker3  Give me something cool.
1224.26 1279.12 speaker2  You open up the glove box and I will ask Joe and Thomas to take your headphones off. Luke, when Keith Vigna reaches into the console and opens it, there is a piece of paper, standard, eight and a half by 11, folded four times, and when you unfold it, it is a picture of you, Keith Vigna, handwritten underneath it. It says, bring alive. Oh shit. You also find a mag light. Okay. so now you've got like a legit flashlight as well as basically a lead pipe as far as. Tight, tight. You can do some serious damage with the guy. Okey-doke. It's an Eve bomb.
1278.12 1297.14 speaker3  Oh shit.
1296.30 1311.80 speaker4  I asked him what he wanted. No, no, I'm fishing around in the truck bed trying to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water. Yeah, okay.
1310.28 1323.64 speaker2  and he's like. Okay, roll unarmed combat.
1322.80 1329.56 speaker4  Okay, 87. I pass with a 32. Nope, I failed.
1326.88 1355.00 speaker2  He dodges out of the way of both slaps quite short, wide dude comes out, these bright white teeth looking like Rocky. He comes out first and he has got a crowbar in his hand.
1353.76 1360.12 speaker1  Hey, who the fuck?
1356.76 1408.64 speaker2  he sees Keith Vigna inside of the truck and he sees John Lee Pettymore III standing in the driveway. We found him. He came to us. He's just right here. And Terrence Liger is following behind but does not seem to have any sort of weapon in his hand currently. And he comes out and he's reaching behind him currently in his back pocket. Clark Bishop, it is your turn
1406.54 1412.80 speaker4  I wanna get to Randy. Is he still on the ground?
1411.96 1415.28 speaker1  We're here to help you.
1414.46 1435.56 speaker4  Yes, shh. Find cover, find cover. I wanna kind of walk past him to the front. I mean, I'm sneaking up on the guys. You can do that.
1431.16 1464.40 speaker2  it's like the heat is turned up super, super high because it is pretty cold out today. It's been a temperate December so far but this is certainly the coldest it's been, mostly so that the animals would have somewhere to be for a while and I could really get that plot going. But, so as it's gotten much colder, Randy has got the heat turned way up. So it's like that thing where you fart in the shower and the heat just like keeps it down.
1463.56 1475.84 speaker1  Do you not know what I'm talking about?
1473.80 1487.56 speaker3  Keeps it down wasn't really the right-
1485.76 1500.92 speaker2  cause the fart can't make it through the steam, right? And so the fart is just like where your head is cause the steam's right above that.
1498.00 1507.92 speaker4  No, that doesn't happen to me when I fart in the shower.
1505.52 1514.28 speaker2  All right, so you guys are, Randy Yanks' house smells like shit cause it's hot fart.
1511.92 1537.38 speaker4  Farting out so many shit particles that they're able to attach to like the water droplets and permeate the air. There's nothing worse than- The humid after shower shit.
1535.54 1540.62 speaker1  Oh my God. Oh God.
1539.06 1546.94 speaker4  And then you take another shower. Yep, a minute second shower. Just smash it down.
1545.26 1553.82 speaker2  Is that where you just stomp it? Oh yeah, I knew it had a name. Pour some shampoo on it to clean it.
1551.06 1561.22 speaker4  Pour some shampoo on it.
1559.98 1563.82 speaker3  and we can sing together.
1561.22 1571.78 speaker2  Oh my God, I miss it. Keith Vigna, it's your turn.
1569.86 1593.98 speaker4  dude, it smells like a shower fart in here. does it happen to you in the shower? Like it dissipates better.
1591.86 1602.14 speaker2  When we're in the shower together.
1599.10 1615.34 speaker3  I also can't wait until we're all in one room to do that. Right, that's how we usually record
1612.30 1637.26 speaker4  to take the shower sounds out of each track. You got to edit all that out. That's the work that goes into each podcast, y'all, where we can't shower and record together anymore. Fartbreaking.
1634.94 1654.34 speaker2  Honestly, we have it the worst. Keith Vigna, you are... as these two men walk outside.
1650.78 1671.06 speaker3  I see them, I jump out of the truck, I get my gun, and I yell, don't come any closer, I'll shoot. And when the camera pans back to me, I've got the gun up to my own head.
1668.78 1693.42 speaker2  Hell yes, hell yes. Oh, you get 10 luck. Hell yeah. Nice, hell yeah. Thomas, do the same thing.
1692.58 1698.82 speaker4  Nope, Terrence. Terrence, Terrence. Yeah, John has.
1696.90 1701.26 speaker2  You've heard me talk about him forever.
1698.82 1704.82 speaker4  Terrence has his hand on his gun, right?
1702.58 1728.50 speaker2  The other guy's holding a crowbar. Both of them or are you just doing suppressing fire? Are you actually trying to hit somebody? Crowbar guy. That's just good storytelling right there. That's friendship storytelling. It's like it would be smarter
1726.26 1743.98 speaker4  to take out the guy with the gun, but.
1740.94 1803.14 speaker2  as John Lee Pettymore pulls his firearm and hits Luca Fade Fudgevitz right in the shoulder. So you fire at him while yelling that You know Fade is the guy who has just been like hanging out on his front lawn for the past like four years, only doing like arm day. Like he only gives a fuck about his upper body. So he's got these little chicken legs now, whereas you know, like when he was younger, he used to be like a bodybuilder and now he's just given up on his legs. He's got this massive upper body and as soon as you shoot him in the shoulder, he drops the crowbar and he's like, Luca, are you just that nice, man?
1799.14 1813.86 speaker4  but you're coming at some police officers. You gotta put those weapons down.
1811.54 1854.06 speaker2  like backs into the garage and then slumps down the white garage door, leaving a trail of red as he like hits his butt on the concrete below and he's like, You think you were here about the smartest man in town, but I think otherwise with Anya, for sure.
1853.14 1866.94 speaker4  It is. I wanna sneak up and wrestle away the gun from him, from behind him. I feel like I should get some kind of advantage on that.
1865.46 1869.42 speaker2  So how are you doing that?
1868.06 1877.90 speaker4  so it's gonna hurt his arm some and get the gun pointed not at his head. And I'm trying to get it out of his hand. I'm trying to take it for my own.
1876.06 1935.58 speaker2  I will either let you do this if you can pass a stealth check Go ahead and roll that unarmed combat. his hands go straight up in the air, the gun fires, It flings itself as it's firing up out of your hands and you two are just standing right outside the front door almost to the driveway of Randy Angst's home, gun 10 feet away in the grass.
1931.78 1943.42 speaker3  I want to run at him with the mag light and try to whack him in the head.
1939.30 1948.74 speaker2  Actually, so he crit failed with a 99. Okay, do I need to roll anything? Yeah, go ahead and roll.
1946.90 1957.90 speaker3  Melee weapons.
1955.38 1961.82 speaker2  can happen here close to it.
1959.50 1977.18 speaker3  the gun goes off, I holster my gun, grab the flashlight from the front seat, run over to him and just like right in the teeth, hit him with the mag light.
1975.34 2019.78 speaker2  You shoot him in the shoulder. It's a joke about how three damage did that earlier. Fucking nailed it. and two teeth go flying as he hits the ground. Clark, he is like pushed into you by this movement and you are now in between him and the gun and he is now prone on the ground, bleeding from his mouth. Luka Fajevic's fade is also on the ground with a gunshot wound in his shoulder bleeding and Thomas is taking off his robe.
2018.14 2023.02 speaker4  All right, there it is.
2022.18 2046.38 speaker2  Here we go. I like the beanie with the shirtless look, Thomas. It's a good combo there. You guys both have great nips. Thanks. Am I allowed to say that? No. Oh, okay. Luke, you've got great nips.
2044.78 2057.06 speaker4  It's an invasion of my privacy.
2054.66 2090.62 speaker2  I have no idea where I was. so you were trying to distract me. You've got this easily in hand, I believe, at this point. Oh, I know, it's just late. It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.
2088.98 2099.74 speaker4  exactly what's going on because he wasn't wasting his time Zoom stripping. You're good at that, by the way.
2097.18 2131.22 speaker2  So, John Lee Pettymore, you are looking at Luka Fade Fajevic You are looking at Keith Vigna who just took a mag light to the face of Terrence Licker who is now ass grounded. And you see Clark Bishop just to the right of them. Yes, I said ass grounded. And Clark Bishop is standing to the right of them, almost in the neighbor's yard at this point. But you guys are all just around this
2129.58 2135.62 speaker4  All right, so gun drawn.
2134.10 2149.74 speaker2  He's not even a cop. I don't even think that one's a cop. Are you not even on duty? You ain't been around, the world is different.
2148.46 2165.34 speaker4  I shoot him in the leg.
2163.06 2170.82 speaker2  All right, John Lee Pettymore's having like a breakdown in the driveway, you cannot figure out what's going on.
2168.30 2200.50 speaker4  Shut up, that's not what happens. You're under arrest. For real, I'm a cop. What, you're under arrest.
2198.58 2206.22 speaker2  Yeah, but you weren't a cop here before.
2203.50 2214.06 speaker4  I am ball, motherfucker. I slap him across the face and I handcuff him.
2212.30 2221.26 speaker2  You don't have any handcuffs.
2220.18 2240.42 speaker4  That's right. Yes. because we said that that's what cops would use in the 70s? Yeah.
2237.50 2265.98 speaker2  who is in all black tactical gear who has a lot of cool stuff, probably like a silencer and like a laser sight and like glow in the dark. Some handcuffs.
2265.14 2271.94 speaker3  It's late.
2268.98 2282.58 speaker2  As you zip tie his hands,
2280.66 2294.34 speaker4  Fuck me, a 73. I don't know if I've passed a role like in the last two episodes. Don't worry.
2290.98 2300.74 speaker2  We're like out of combat essentially at this point.
2299.06 2308.98 speaker3  Is he face down or face up?
2304.58 2311.90 speaker2  And Luke Terence is face up, ass grounded.
2308.98 2334.50 speaker3  I go over to him and I just kind of like kick him with my foot and like shove him over, like roll him over to where he's on his stomach. I reach in to his back pocket and grab his wallet and look inside. What do I see inside the wallet?
2330.82 2353.46 speaker2  You know, he's got a punch card for Subtropolis and he's got his ID and he's got a few credit cards, like four or five credit cards, no debit card, no library card, certainly not. However, he's in Mensa. So he's got a little Mensa ID card.
2352.50 2362.30 speaker3  Cash?
2361.06 2375.02 speaker4  Times 1000.
2370.74 2381.46 speaker2  No, 13 works out perfectly for you.
2377.58 2406.30 speaker3  I take the three ones, like hold it down by his face and I'm like, we're even now. And I like take the $10 bill and like rip it up in front of him and then stick the $3 in my pocket. I look at the guys, I'm like, should we go to the pond now?
2403.74 2424.30 speaker4  Yeah, sorry, I just, I kinda had. I think we might be able to unravel some more right here. You know, I focused in on the pond and as soon as that was complete, you're like, let's go, I get it.
2422.38 2446.10 speaker3  I look down at Terrence, hey, if you can still talk without your teeth, what's up with the bodies, why do you have this? And I show him the picture of me that I found in his truck.
2442.66 2455.18 speaker2  There are torture rules in the Delta Green handbook.
2453.22 2470.94 speaker4  you fucking incompetent keeper. Oh, we don't play Delta Green. I know.
2466.58 2483.06 speaker2  either some sort of persuade or law. if you wanna like try to turn a mind for it.
2481.86 2500.26 speaker3  well, if you're not gonna talk and I like shove it into his mouth. Nobody does.
2498.10 2502.50 speaker4  that we were shoving down Drew's throat
2501.18 2506.98 speaker1  to see where people were?
2505.18 2516.30 speaker2  I mean, maybe it works on any throat.
2513.58 2525.18 speaker4  we've broken your game wide open, Zach.
2523.42 2529.12 speaker3  Am I gonna have to keep going?
2527.62 2534.14 speaker2  What do you want?
2532.98 2544.90 speaker3  What are you doing here? Why do you have a picture of me? And what's this with the bodies and disappearing? Yeah, what do you want with Randy?
2542.86 2588.70 speaker2  and the first question are the same. We need more bodies. Daddy needs more bodies. For what? I don't know if you've noticed, but the world is completely off its filter and daddy's gonna make everything better. He's gonna go back. Everything's gonna go back to normal. We're gonna go back to normal. and make sure everything's normal from here on out, right? then it won't be this way now.
2587.46 2604.02 speaker4  You damn fool. Daddy doesn't wanna take things back to the way they were. What do you mean by daddy wants to go back? In time.
2602.54 2611.58 speaker3  He's doing this with a sacrifice?
2608.44 2625.46 speaker4  or is this something that you've learned recently? How do you know about how this is gonna work? Daddy explained it to everyone
2621.62 2631.86 speaker2  we need more bodies so that we can do the sacrifice
2630.66 2638.40 speaker4  How many bodies you're gonna need? No, I'm just a collector. How many have you got? Me?
2637.58 2645.06 speaker2  But-
2643.84 2649.46 speaker4  What do you win? What does winner get? What do the losers get?
2647.62 2678.26 speaker2  Well, the losers still fought the family so ain't nobody really a loser. We're all dying anyway. There ain't no living here. Have you seen contention? There ain't no living here. The only change we have having a real life is going back and daddy can go back and fix everything. If you don't wanna be a part of it, you need to go get on out of here, but we need to keep Keith because Keith is the key that's going back.
2676.06 2683.26 speaker4  So you just believe everything daddy tells you.
2680.90 2699.18 speaker2  you see this piece of paper that he spit out that Keith Vigna shoved into his mouth is a picture of Keith Vigna. And below it, it says whatever I said earlier,
2697.86 2708.62 speaker4  and I say, daddy.
2706.36 2713.06 speaker1  What the fuck was that?
2710.22 2736.48 speaker2  and then he starts squirming, horrified. He is extremely, extremely scared of John Lee Pettymore the third. When he looks up and sees John Lee Pettymore after John shoves this piece of carpet into his throat, he freaks out and he's like, you're one of them. It's in you, it's in you.
2734.72 2745.86 speaker4  I think it's in all of you.
2740.86 2767.78 speaker2  and Jimmy Sanders with his long unkempt hippie hair does the like Bond girl fling out of the water that's in the back of this truck and looks over at you. It's not an oil spill, it lives here now.
2765.46 2772.98 speaker4  That's basically how Jimmy was before all this. So that's not, you know.
2769.34 2778.06 speaker3  Look at Terrence, are you using him to see the stuff?
2777.02 2785.40 speaker4  Good job, Luke.
2782.98 2867.10 speaker2  without him dipping into the water. No, it's specifically when he's looking at you and I need you to roll sanity. Me? Yes. But Luke and Joe, if you could take off your headphones real quick. However, you approached Jimmy Sanders who immediately like looks you in the face, gets extremely scared and then dips into the water and as you're turning back, you catch a reflection of yourself in the shotgun side mirror of this truck and there is black ooze dripping out of both of your nostrils, running down your face from both of your eyes, coming out maybe one of the sides of your mouth and running down from both of your ears and then you blink and it is not there and you look like you always do.
2864.94 2875.66 speaker4  So you guys see Kevin Lee Pettymore take a step back from the truck and like he falls backwards. He lands on his ass.
2874.82 2889.42 speaker0  Trip there?
2885.26 2898.02 speaker4  saw the goo running out of all my orifices, so I blinked, it was gone, but it was there real as day.
2896.78 2903.74 speaker3  Did it move?
2901.86 2924.42 speaker4  coming out of my nose, holes in my. and he dives into that pool with Jimmy Sanders.
2921.68 3014.04 speaker2  Luke and Joe, I need you to take your headphones off again. into this puddle that has been formed and teeming with fish in the back of this truck, your head vibrates like it's sizzling and you feel basically in your ears and in your nose, you feel like when your ears are super clogged up and then you pour hydrogen peroxide or something in there And you feel it in your nose and it like tickles and there's something inside of your head that is just like throbbing and all of a sudden, you feel yourself rolling. You feel yourself rolling back and forth comfortably. It's warmth, it's comfort. You said come. You can feel.
3013.22 3026.14 speaker4  Okay, shit.
3025.08 3162.46 speaker2  but it's just gum. It's like a gingerbread house, but it's cum. Instead of peppermints, like there's just cock rings all over it and like. Too far. Oh boy. Yeah, you just feel yourself rolling back and forth and then you realize that you are rolling back and forth in a palm. And then you lift your head above the water and immediately. The smell is awful. Like a shower. There is a distinct stench. It is fishy, but it is rancid. It is overpoweringly stinky. After Jon lifts his head above the water, you all smell this and it is coming from the truck bed and it fucking reeks. Jon, I need you to roll constitution What's your throw up like? But mostly just because you've been drinking motor oil for you to pee again, Thomas. Oh my. And Jimmy Sanders is, it doesn't live here. And then he's gonna stand up and then he's gonna sit back down. freaked out, jumped in there and started throwing up.
3161.62 3171.70 speaker4  and came from the truck. Then the truck started smelling terrible, yeah.
3170.06 3180.18 speaker2  Right, I figured, but. He's just like talking this whole time. He's always talking and he's always just like,
3178.18 3182.74 speaker4  yeah, of course you'd have a number one,
3180.18 3199.50 speaker2  but like, you can't have that without living here. I mean, the oil is extra tomatoes, but the split, you know, I can't cut it in half for the reasons, you know, he's vegetarian. I'm a pescatarian, but I only eat meat.
3197.20 3201.46 speaker3  how do you get him to tell you about the ooze?
3199.78 3205.06 speaker2  Oh, he just screams normally.
3203.62 3209.90 speaker3  I mean, it smells, don't it?
3208.10 3222.90 speaker2  Clearly, your bar just dumped in there because he was trying to avoid it. We couldn't see it, but your friends there is crazy. I want y'all to know that. He could have seen it, he jumped in there, and now it smells, of course it does, because when the fifth gets smelled, it smells like it.
3221.70 3242.26 speaker4  John, are you all right? John lifts his head out of the water and smells the smell, sees that Jimmy's not screaming, and he's like, I am now, I'm all right now, maybe.
3239.22 3256.42 speaker2  No, it seems tricky, I don't know either. your friend is crazy. The one who's not a cop, he's crazy.
3254.82 3260.94 speaker3  I don't believe you. How would you know that?
3259.82 3301.26 speaker2  and now it smells. When the puddles get teemed, right, they got fish in them, right? But when the fish collect, we're doing collecting of people, when the fish collect, it smells. three-piece suit, except for instead of the pants that match,
3299.66 3312.54 speaker1  What do you know about all this?
3310.10 3335.54 speaker3  I think it's the pastor.
3330.54 3341.66 speaker1  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.
3340.26 3396.02 speaker4  Oh, no. Remember that burning, that burning vehicle with the family inside? Not enough, I guess. I pulled someone out of that. But people perished, right? Yeah, for sure. There's like a wife and maybe a couple kids. we weren't getting much of a ruckus out of the pastor until, you know, maybe he could have directly linked us to his family's demise.
3393.42 3403.30 speaker2  It was right before you skipped town. So-called contention police officers. I believe you murdered three-
3400.26 3410.18 speaker4  One thing you need to know is that we did not skip town. Everything we've done between here and now, like the outset of all this and now, is to save this town.
3408.18 3429.14 speaker2  And the only thing that's happened since then is that we've lost almost our entire population of contention, and the pastor who's now taken over lost his wife, his daughter, and his son in a car accident that was caused by you and all of your tomfoolery.
3425.06 3435.58 speaker4  We're not the ones gathering up the population's bodies.
3433.14 3440.66 speaker1  I saved the son, I did what I could.
3438.74 3459.30 speaker2  I think there was one specific role that would have saved him, and it was right before he took off in the ambulance, and it was a failed role. So that killed a child. And gave us our main enemy for this situation.
3457.06 3471.38 speaker3  What are we gonna do with these guys? We can't let him go back to the pastor.
3467.18 3480.54 speaker2  and he is eyes closed up against the garage door. And there's a trail of blood now making its way at, it's about halfway down the driveway.
3479.14 3483.58 speaker1  It's much more comfortable.
3482.22 3489.86 speaker3  No, we need you out here, Randy.
3487.58 3505.46 speaker4  Do you have a bunch of different canes? No, that's my cane.
3502.98 3509.34 speaker1  Ha, but no, it's a Rubik's Cube.
3507.98 3561.18 speaker2  It says that he is the director of the Children's Museum of Mathematics. The Children's Museum of Mathematics is a location given to us by a patron at the $10 level. David from San Jose. Thanks, David, good job. Thank you, thank you, thank you. The Children's Museum of Mathematics is an underfunded museum, which aims to get kids excited about math. It's mostly puzzles and exhibits about how you can arrange shapes. and pulls out a bunch of business cards that all say Randy Angst,
3559.46 3566.50 speaker3  we ran into each other?
3563.66 3573.74 speaker2  I believe you may have pulled me over That's my bad.
3572.02 3579.42 speaker4  you just shit all over your pants just a few days ago.
3577.76 3585.90 speaker2  but the pants that I just shit in about 15 minutes ago are already in the washer.
3584.22 3598.10 speaker4  of the Contention Historical Society? I'm a member, but I didn't, is that you were director.
3596.98 3603.08 speaker2  My old card?
3602.24 3610.16 speaker4  remember that? It was a robot. You were staring at the legs. His upper half flew off the window.
3609.32 3633.92 speaker2  from the three of you. You were in chess games. and he's backing into his doorway of his house.
3631.62 3640.70 speaker4  instead of your three piece suit pants. That's cause you shit your pants.
3638.50 3654.54 speaker1  I know it's not a crime, but how would we know that
3652.94 3656.66 speaker3  Is 91 good?
3655.54 3668.54 speaker4  38, fail. Yeah, I got bad news for Randy Yanks. I failed over my power.
3667.64 3675.14 speaker2  No, just one.
3671.64 3681.68 speaker4  and we might as well just bail on this reality. Later.
3680.40 3695.72 speaker2  I don't know if it'll be satisfying. You know, people say we don't get a lot of satisfying conclusions to these plot points, but Luke wrapped up that three single dollar things so fast.
3694.88 3707.42 speaker4  Fucking nailed it.
3706.42 3726.72 speaker2  Is Randy Yanks? He's not our Randy Yanks. Exactly, but maybe somebody's Randy Yanks and Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna both roll over their power, lose one sanity, and then Clark goes first. Clark is rushing the door
3723.90 3742.62 speaker4  but he's rushing the front door to attack Randy. Yeah, let's just do a quick roll. Okay, what kind of roll?
3740.66 3745.82 speaker1  It's a 52 on a 60.
3744.98 3749.74 speaker2  Oh yeah.
3747.42 3770.18 speaker4  I barrel in the door so hard that it knocks him back and onto the ground. And I'm doing like I did to Keith. Oh, no. Just moments before, and I'm throttling him into the ground,
3767.74 3795.62 speaker3  I see that and I start looking around and I see the two guys on the ground and Jimmy in the back, and I'm like, this is a trap. Somebody's coming and I get my gun out and I just shoot. I shoot at Terrence. Holy shit. Holy shit. Should I roll firearms? No, I'm gonna roll.
3794.18 3833.58 speaker2  If you're just like unloading a clip around like three people. Yeah, then I'll roll luck for each of them. It won't be 50-50. It'll be like a 25% chance that it hits any one of them. 22. So... a three and a four is Fade, and a five and a six is Terrence.
3832.74 3838.34 speaker3  No, that's Fade. Fade.
3835.26 3855.74 speaker2  You like fire a couple shots towards Jimmy Sanders and then a couple shots towards Terrence, who's like right next to you, like on the ground. As you're looking at Terrence, you just like hold it up and fire over it, Fade, and go ahead and roll a D10. Nine.
3854.82 3861.18 speaker3  Oh boy.
3860.34 3865.62 speaker1  Clark Marshall here.
3864.26 3970.26 speaker2  shoving the door backwards, knocking Randy Anks on his back. Keith Vigna begins unloading his clip into the area, freaking out, his eyes are wide. Johnny, you can see it and he's panicking. And as he's panicking, you can't even tell where he's aiming this gun. And then all of a sudden you just see like the fucking Zapruder film. Luca, Fade, Fajevic's head, Just abstract art on the garage door of Randy Anks as the shoulders slump off to the right with the momentum of this gunshot. And the blood now starts a second path down the driveway, but the second one is moving much, much quicker and it is much wider and thicker with the blood of Luca, Fade, Fajevic as he dies errant bullet from an insane Keith Vigna who turns to you. And I need John Lee Pettymore, Thomas, sorry, and Joe to take your headphones off. you see that this black viscous ooze is pouring out of his nose and it is dripping from his mouth and it is running down his cheeks from his eyes and from his ears, it is going underneath his shirt. From his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.
3967.58 3978.74 speaker3  I look back over at him and I point my gun at him and I say, get back in the water.
3976.10 3985.98 speaker4  Aw, all right, and he does so.
3984.94 3991.62 speaker1  Oh, all right. And me, all right. Holy shit. Bye.
