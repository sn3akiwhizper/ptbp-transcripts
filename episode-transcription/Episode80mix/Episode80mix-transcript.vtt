WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Rub, rub, rub, rub that magic lamp, baby.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.360
Rub it up real nice.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.080
Oh shit, I'm coming on out.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.480
It's your gin who's hooked on gin

00:12.480 --> 00:15.160
as long as it's made in a bathtub.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.460
I'm your fermented genie wolf the dog.

00:18.460 --> 00:20.280
And I'm granting you three wishes

00:20.280 --> 00:24.360
as long as they're all about me and giving me cool stuff.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.760
I'm getting rubbed on live here

00:26.760 --> 00:31.760
over on 694.2 PTBP, my babies.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Do y'all think if you fed a cow enough paromchaun cheese

00:37.360 --> 00:39.840
it would make some kind of Alfredo

00:39.840 --> 00:44.480
come out those long milk skin tubes it's got on its tummy?

00:44.480 --> 00:46.620
If you can help, please send answers

00:46.620 --> 00:49.080
to this very serious inquiry

00:49.080 --> 00:51.680
to at pretending pod on Twitter

00:51.680 --> 00:55.080
or at pretending pod on Instagram

00:55.080 --> 00:58.760
or tag us on Facebook as pretending to be people.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.760
We here at 694.2 PTBP love getting to know our wolf pups

01:04.400 --> 01:05.800
on the old internet.

01:05.800 --> 01:10.120
So throw us a follow, a like, a retweet, a doggy treat,

01:10.120 --> 01:13.240
and then join us in the subreddit r slash pretending

01:13.240 --> 01:16.120
to be people and hop on into the discord

01:16.120 --> 01:20.040
to hang, talk theories, and play games with other listeners.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.800
It's a fucking sweetheart of a community.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.640
There's links to all this shit in the show notes

01:25.640 --> 01:28.880
and you know what would just be the swellest.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.880
Swing on into Apple Podcasts and write up a five star review.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.360
If it's truly spicy, your Wolfie might read it here on air.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.120
Like I'm reading this one here from Ford Beeblebrox

01:42.120 --> 01:44.820
titled You Should Probably Seek Therapy.

01:44.820 --> 01:48.880
They write, the game is Delta Green, mostly.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.600
The cast are humans, mostly.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.320
The jokes are funny, five out of five.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.120
After listening to this show, I'm not entirely certain

01:57.120 --> 01:59.120
that I'm sane anymore though.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.720
Do I need to talk to my dog more often?

02:01.720 --> 02:03.800
Have I been to this bar before?

02:03.800 --> 02:06.220
Is one of my eyeballs made of metal?

02:06.220 --> 02:09.360
I don't wanna poke myself in the eye to find out,

02:09.360 --> 02:12.120
but well, sanity has its limits.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.900
Kind of a one way street, that one.

02:14.900 --> 02:18.120
Anyway, if you want a story that is stupidly hilarious

02:18.120 --> 02:23.120
while still being spooky, this is the one.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.040
Start at episode one and just go forward, but seek therapy.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.240
Ha ha ha ha ha.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.560
Thank you, Ford Beeblebrox.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.880
Don't panic, but make sure y'all always remember

02:36.880 --> 02:41.200
to bring a towel because this show is very messy.

02:41.200 --> 02:46.200
I give the review a 42 out of 42 stars, my babies.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.480
For those insatiable garbage hounds out there

02:50.480 --> 02:53.960
with the delicious luxury of financial stability,

02:53.960 --> 02:58.560
you can support the show on patreon.com slash pretendinpod

02:58.560 --> 03:02.640
and instantly access 11 bonus episodes,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.400
the most recent of which is part one

03:05.400 --> 03:08.640
of our playthrough of Lover in the Ice,

03:08.640 --> 03:13.440
a legitimately nasty scenario for Delta Green.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.040
Even I think that shit's nasty.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.520
You know who I am.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.500
This scenario was chosen by popular vote

03:21.500 --> 03:24.080
in a poll exclusive to our patrons,

03:24.080 --> 03:26.800
wherein y'all pups proved the filthy apple

03:26.800 --> 03:30.480
doesn't fall too far from this fucking obscene tree.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.280
Remember, y'all, hit up our Twitch

03:32.280 --> 03:35.080
for some good video game and chill times.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.080
I don't know what a video game is,

03:37.080 --> 03:39.160
but I hear they're pretty fun.

03:39.160 --> 03:42.560
Apparently, Justin has been doing some prime hang time

03:42.560 --> 03:46.360
with the community there Tuesday and Thursday evenings,

03:46.360 --> 03:48.280
chatting with y'all and such,

03:48.280 --> 03:52.560
twitch.tv slash pretendinpodstreams.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.240
Now, put your stress in suspension.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.480
Give in to the ooze.

03:57.480 --> 04:02.200
Decompress and contention and embrace the news.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.040
The town of contention is very, very different.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.140
There was a roadblock at the exit.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.360
There are man-made puddles all over the place.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.600
The town is quiet.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.120
A massive wall of water filled with fish

04:16.120 --> 04:19.620
surrounds the campus of the First Church of Contention.

04:19.620 --> 04:22.640
In response, John Lee Bettymore the Thirth

04:22.640 --> 04:25.460
just repeatedly slapped Keith's dad's watch

04:25.460 --> 04:27.800
on wrist after wrist in an attempt

04:27.800 --> 04:30.560
to gain as much information as possible.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.220
One of those visions brought the name Silas Cole

04:33.220 --> 04:34.780
back into the story.

04:34.780 --> 04:38.660
Silas Cole was one of the founders of contention.

04:38.660 --> 04:41.200
In his speech at his daughter's funeral,

04:41.920 --> 04:43.640
Stan Manstein claimed.

04:43.640 --> 04:48.640
My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.920
She was those things when she was a police officer.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.720
She was those things when she was a school teacher.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.920
She was those things when she was a historian.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.000
You see, one long time ago when this land was stolen

05:03.000 --> 05:05.320
and pioneer towns began to form,

05:05.320 --> 05:08.400
Silas Cole was a miner in the mine

05:08.400 --> 05:12.080
that employed the town nearby of contention.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.040
While down in the mines,

05:14.040 --> 05:17.720
Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance

05:17.720 --> 05:20.700
and he became obsessed with studying it.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.480
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.560
Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,

05:27.560 --> 05:30.280
he became an inventor and made so much money

05:30.280 --> 05:33.400
off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.400
He built an office on the top floor

05:35.400 --> 05:37.840
of the tall, skinny mining company building

05:38.120 --> 05:40.640
that sat right above the mine itself.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.840
He began to harvest the residue

05:42.840 --> 05:46.400
and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.120
He invented wild, magical things.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.040
Each new invention brought him wealth and power,

05:52.040 --> 05:56.680
but also released more of this inky substance into the town.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.960
To divert his raising paranoia,

05:58.960 --> 06:01.120
he began looking for a partner.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.440
He found a similarly intelligent engineer

06:03.440 --> 06:07.000
in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance

06:07.000 --> 06:09.200
as they began calling residue.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.920
But Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.

06:11.920 --> 06:15.000
He became paranoid that other people could see the residue

06:15.000 --> 06:17.520
that was loose all over the town.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.560
Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him,

06:20.560 --> 06:24.820
so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much.

06:25.840 --> 06:28.700
The town was suspicious of the disappearances,

06:28.700 --> 06:31.920
but most of the ones gone were bad people.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.720
The whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty,

06:34.720 --> 06:36.820
the piano player, there's a few gamblers,

06:37.660 --> 06:39.420
the town drunk, so they kept their heads down

06:39.420 --> 06:41.220
and went about their business.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.180
But then some good people disappeared,

06:43.180 --> 06:46.460
a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,

06:46.460 --> 06:50.100
the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.900
The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy

06:52.900 --> 06:55.180
named Cornelius Beans to kill

06:55.180 --> 06:58.540
their weird, paranoid figurehead.

06:58.540 --> 07:01.820
Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.500
Neither was Cornelius Beans.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.300
That was the history of contention,

07:08.300 --> 07:12.580
when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or Ben,

07:12.580 --> 07:15.380
but her name is Ari forever now,

07:15.380 --> 07:17.820
and our history is different.

07:17.820 --> 07:20.660
Mine is now definite.

07:20.660 --> 07:24.540
Before they could continue binge-watching,

07:24.540 --> 07:26.940
Keith heard the voice of Terrence Licker

07:26.940 --> 07:29.380
threateningly holler at Randy Anx

07:29.380 --> 07:32.100
from an idling truck about a block away.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.860
Keith has beef.

07:33.860 --> 07:37.540
Tea Licker owes him three fucking dollars.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.460
At Randy's, John found his cousin, Jimmy,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.880
a bit off his rocker in a truck bed

07:42.880 --> 07:45.020
that's been puddle-teamed,

07:45.020 --> 07:47.340
and Clark saw Randy through the window

07:47.340 --> 07:51.380
being held down by a man in cahoots with Terrence Licker.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.120
Keith just grabbed the keys

07:53.120 --> 07:54.820
from out of the truck's ignition,

07:54.820 --> 07:56.840
tipping off the opposition,

07:56.840 --> 07:58.820
delivering us now to a scene

07:58.820 --> 08:01.220
that puts the tension in contention.

08:01.260 --> 08:04.900
It's kudzu with no back bone.

08:35.460 --> 08:38.100
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Pretending to Be People.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.460
We are on episode 80.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.660
My name is Zach, and I am the one leading you

08:43.660 --> 08:46.980
through this adventure with my words,

08:46.980 --> 08:49.460
just painting pictures of scenes

08:49.460 --> 08:54.220
that you are then forced to see inside of your own mind,

08:54.220 --> 08:58.180
and helping me concoct these very, very logical

08:58.180 --> 09:01.180
and easy-to-follow stories are my three...

09:04.900 --> 09:06.900
...e...

09:17.380 --> 09:19.940
...best friends.

09:19.940 --> 09:21.620
Thanks for having us. Oh, this is really awkward.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.260
We are three best friends,

09:24.260 --> 09:25.940
but we're not best friends with you.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.700
Yes! Yeah, we're all three best friends.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.500
No, no, no, like the three of us.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.740
The three of us are best friends.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.060
He owns us, so we're his.

09:33.060 --> 09:36.180
No, but we've done, like, his three best friends.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.900
I definitely have three best friends here, for sure.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.020
Yeah, exactly, is what we're trying to say,

09:41.020 --> 09:43.100
but every time we get together with you,

09:43.100 --> 09:45.980
you're like, I've got these stories to tell.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.620
You have to play in them, and it's like, God,

09:48.620 --> 09:52.860
sometimes I just want to fucking tell you about my day.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.260
Anyway, that's why you're not top three.

09:55.260 --> 09:56.700
Oh, that's a really good point, Thomas.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.500
Tell me about your day.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.060
Oh, well, it's...

10:02.100 --> 10:03.220
I fucking got you.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.740
I don't consider you one of my best friends,

10:08.740 --> 10:10.340
so I don't want to share that.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.700
It's 2020, Thomas, tell me about your day.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.740
What?

10:17.740 --> 10:20.180
Tell me about your day.

10:20.180 --> 10:21.740
It rained today.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.420
It did rain all day.

10:23.420 --> 10:26.020
My dog got muddy, and I gave her a bath.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.300
I had to wipe my dog's paws off when he came inside,

10:29.300 --> 10:30.260
but he didn't get muddy.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.300
I let my dog run around outside for an hour,

10:32.300 --> 10:33.820
and she rolled in mud.

10:33.820 --> 10:34.660
I said, you know what?

10:34.660 --> 10:35.500
Have your fun.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.100
I let Joe outside, but his feet were dry as fuck

10:39.100 --> 10:40.140
when he came back in.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.500
It's a thing that they do.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.500
They're so dry.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.540
They just auto dry.

10:47.020 --> 10:49.380
Joe, I so enjoy our walks.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.220
I do too.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.780
Sometimes you let me off the leash.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.220
Until you attack families.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.380
I just get excited.

11:03.540 --> 11:06.220
I've just been picturing Joe this whole time.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.060
On all fours.

11:08.060 --> 11:13.060
Yeah, but like smiling, like smile growling.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.900
Hey, so everybody keeping it together during quarantine?

11:16.900 --> 11:17.740
Nope.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.420
All right.

11:21.420 --> 11:22.540
It's hard to

11:22.540 --> 11:27.540
get anything done.

11:30.340 --> 11:34.060
I'm having a difficult time focusing on anything.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.060
You guys, do you guys feel my, feel it?

11:38.060 --> 11:40.380
Have you tried staying up until like five or six

11:40.380 --> 11:42.700
in the morning and then waking up after noon,

11:42.700 --> 11:44.120
quite a bit after noon?

11:45.300 --> 11:46.140
You know what?

11:46.140 --> 11:46.960
I have.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.800
That's how I tried.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.340
That was the first thing I tried, yeah.

11:50.340 --> 11:51.900
The cool thing that happens with me

11:52.100 --> 11:54.540
is that my sleep schedule seems to just like rotate

11:54.540 --> 11:58.300
throughout the week as if it's completely divorced

11:58.300 --> 12:02.100
from the rotation of our own planet.

12:02.100 --> 12:07.100
So one day a week for sure I'll be up till five

12:07.900 --> 12:09.980
and then that kind of shifts.

12:09.980 --> 12:14.540
Sometimes I go to bed at 7 p.m. and then wake up at 5 a.m.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.600
and then other times it's the opposite.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.700
Yeah, my vices are pushing me basically

12:19.700 --> 12:21.380
like wholeheartedly at this point.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.120
They've taken the reins on when I sleep.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.540
So it's purely caffeine and weed,

12:28.540 --> 12:30.820
just like back and forth and back and forth

12:30.820 --> 12:35.020
until I am either awake and able to do stuff

12:35.020 --> 12:37.960
like freak out or asleep.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.220
I've been huffing paint to go to sleep.

12:42.780 --> 12:43.620
Congrats, man.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.440
I'm really proud of you.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.660
I ran out of glue, so.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.100
Gotta graduate.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.840
I don't know which one I prefer, honestly.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.860
I prefer Glue, Luke.

12:51.860 --> 12:52.700
Glue.

12:52.700 --> 12:53.520
Glue.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.640
Paint Luke is a little edgy.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.200
You don't like my silver goatee?

13:01.760 --> 13:02.980
Five years.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.640
It doesn't feel like it's been five years

13:04.640 --> 13:06.660
since Fairy Road came out, but it has been

13:06.660 --> 13:09.080
and that's what we're talking about for this whole hour

13:09.080 --> 13:11.200
here on Pretending to Be People.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.360
Oh, that'd be fucking awesome.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.200
I would do that.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.060
Half decade anniversary of one of the greatest

13:15.060 --> 13:15.900
action movies ever made.

13:15.900 --> 13:18.160
Did it really come out five years ago?

13:18.160 --> 13:19.000
Damn.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.120
I saw it in IMAX.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.000
It blew my mind.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.320
I saw it three times in theaters.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.000
I saw it twice in theaters.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.620
The second time was someone who I dated

13:29.620 --> 13:33.640
for nearly two years, but I shouldn't have

13:33.640 --> 13:35.560
because at the start of our relationship

13:35.560 --> 13:38.720
we saw Fury Road and she was like, I fucking hated that.

13:40.940 --> 13:42.440
Yeah, you should have known to hop out

13:42.440 --> 13:44.920
right then and there, but if you had,

13:44.920 --> 13:48.540
we wouldn't be friends, so I'm glad that you stuck around.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.560
Sorry and thanks.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.400
I can't imagine that she would

13:53.400 --> 13:55.640
much less make it 80 episodes.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.400
Every time I worry about saying something,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.560
A, they're not gonna listen to it this far in

14:02.560 --> 14:05.120
and B, if they just decided to like listen

14:05.120 --> 14:07.480
to episode 80 for some reason,

14:07.480 --> 14:10.040
if they make it all the way through Wolf the Dog

14:10.040 --> 14:12.680
not knowing what the fuck is going on,

14:12.680 --> 14:15.760
then they deserve to hear what I think about it.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.400
Who are you thinking about in particular right now

14:18.440 --> 14:20.400
that you wanna just say like fuck you two

14:20.400 --> 14:21.240
or like something bad about him?

14:21.240 --> 14:24.400
My dad, I love him so much that it's just like,

14:25.280 --> 14:27.160
you know when you love someone so much,

14:27.160 --> 14:30.080
you know when you're like.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.360
Fuck you, dad.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.960
C, Thomas, when a boy loves his father.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.200
Very much.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.880
Do you guys wanna play some role playing?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.120
I wanna hear more about the dads and the Bs.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.980
You fuck your dad and make a mom.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.900
Where do mommies come from?

14:48.900 --> 14:51.260
When a son loves a father very much.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.340
Yes, we here at Pretending to Be People

15:03.340 --> 15:08.340
are very tolerant, even encouraging of behavior

15:08.560 --> 15:12.220
far past that that is recognized as appropriate.

15:12.220 --> 15:13.380
Hold on, encouraging?

15:15.980 --> 15:18.860
Oh yeah, no, I just misspoke terribly just now.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.780
Not when I'm in it all.

15:21.780 --> 15:25.180
Listen, we here at PTBP defend your right

15:25.180 --> 15:26.860
to fuck your dad.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.060
Consensually.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.180
In the pursuit of a mom.

15:29.180 --> 15:30.220
Right. Exactly.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.060
Okay, so now that we're all on the same page.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.100
We're pro mom.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.220
As it says in Ecclesiastes 4.16.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.980
Fuck your dad.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.460
In the pursuit of your mom.

15:41.460 --> 15:42.300
Yes.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.660
John Lee Pettymore the third is standing

15:46.660 --> 15:49.820
on the driveway of Randy Angst's home.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.400
He's staring into the bed of a truck

15:52.400 --> 15:55.620
that is made into a puddle that is teaming with fish

15:55.620 --> 15:59.880
and also not so much teaming, but consisting of a body

15:59.880 --> 16:01.800
that it belongs to Jimmy Sanders.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.540
However, the mind of Jimmy Sanders,

16:03.540 --> 16:06.560
it is unsure of whether or not he is still in there

16:06.560 --> 16:09.540
because he is not acting himself.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.780
When he saw John Lee Pettymore the third,

16:11.780 --> 16:15.660
he dove into this water around the side of the car,

16:15.660 --> 16:18.340
standing there with holding the keys.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.580
They were just in the ignition of this truck

16:20.580 --> 16:21.980
is Keith Vigna.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.980
And standing outside the side of the house,

16:24.980 --> 16:27.660
looking in the window is Clark Bishop.

16:27.660 --> 16:31.420
You notice that this man, this burly as fuck,

16:31.420 --> 16:36.160
five foot four, rocky sweat suit wearing motherfucker.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.260
You know him as Fade.

16:39.820 --> 16:40.660
It's a nickname.

16:40.660 --> 16:44.780
His name is Luca Fajevic, but everybody calls him Fade.

16:44.780 --> 16:45.620
Shout out.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.660
Luke was like, what'd you call me?

16:47.660 --> 16:52.540
Shout out to Lucas from Connecticut,

16:52.540 --> 16:56.580
one of our patrons who is at the $10 level,

16:56.580 --> 16:59.500
which is called the honorary police officers.

16:59.500 --> 17:04.500
And he submitted Luca Fade Fajevic as his MPC.

17:04.940 --> 17:08.780
Luca Fade Fajevic and Terrence Licker

17:08.780 --> 17:11.180
are standing over Randy Angst.

17:11.180 --> 17:15.640
And Randy Angst is face down in his own carpet

17:15.640 --> 17:18.140
wearing a fancy blue suit.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.900
And to the right of him, there's a cane.

17:20.900 --> 17:24.940
You'd remember that Randy Angst uses a cane to get around,

17:24.940 --> 17:26.860
so it's not necessarily great.

17:26.860 --> 17:28.620
You do see this cane next to him

17:28.620 --> 17:31.420
has a big Rubik's Cube on the top.

17:31.420 --> 17:36.340
Standing right behind Luca Fade Fajevic

17:36.340 --> 17:40.260
is T. Licker, Terrence Licker,

17:40.260 --> 17:43.260
famed beef-haver with Keith Bigna.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.460
Beef house.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.780
I smell like beef.

17:45.780 --> 17:49.060
He says, all right there, Randy.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.960
We just need to get you on out there.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.980
We need bodies and you know we need them.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.680
And you know, if you want things to go back,

17:55.680 --> 17:58.920
if you want back to where it used to be,

17:58.920 --> 18:00.380
then you can have it, you know?

18:00.380 --> 18:03.660
And the truck engine outside stops.

18:03.660 --> 18:07.140
It's combat order time, and I say combat order,

18:07.140 --> 18:09.620
but what I really mean is initiative.

18:09.620 --> 18:13.100
And therefore, we will begin as we always do

18:13.100 --> 18:14.060
with Clark Bishop.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.720
Do they see me?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.220
Wait, do we have said initiative?

18:17.220 --> 18:22.060
The initiative in Delta Green is based on dexterity

18:22.060 --> 18:25.140
and therefore it should be Clark Bishop,

18:25.140 --> 18:28.420
then Keith Bigna, then John Lee Pettymore, I believe.

18:28.420 --> 18:30.220
Mine is a default 55,

18:30.220 --> 18:32.820
but I think if I've annotated this right,

18:32.820 --> 18:36.080
that's minus 10 for my robot abilities, so 45.

18:36.080 --> 18:36.980
I'm at 60.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.560
And Clark Bishop has a talent that lets him go first

18:39.560 --> 18:41.140
at the beginning of any combat.

18:41.140 --> 18:43.440
And because I like to make things easy on myself,

18:43.440 --> 18:48.180
it always goes PCs, then NPCs, then back to the PCs.

18:48.180 --> 18:49.820
So you guys get to begin first.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.020
Clark Bishop, what are you doing?

18:51.020 --> 18:51.940
They heard the car stop.

18:51.940 --> 18:55.120
Do they look up and see me or where do they look?

18:55.120 --> 18:57.500
They look to the front of the house.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.780
They do not see you.

18:58.780 --> 18:59.860
When we were approaching the house,

18:59.860 --> 19:02.180
I assumed there was a back door on this place.

19:02.180 --> 19:06.300
I'm gonna try sneaking my way back to the back door.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.760
Okay, Keith Bigna, what are you doing?

19:07.760 --> 19:09.940
I wanna search the console and the truck

19:09.940 --> 19:11.180
and see if there's anything in there.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.180
Okay, real search.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.380
What are you looking for?

19:15.380 --> 19:17.060
He asked right as you crit.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.820
Everything you have.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.500
I'm just looking in there to see what's in there,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.460
but mostly I'm looking for money,

19:25.460 --> 19:28.100
specifically at least $3

19:28.100 --> 19:31.900
and any weapons that might be in there.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.620
I know that you critically succeeded,

19:33.620 --> 19:36.100
but there's no chance that there's money in there

19:36.100 --> 19:40.380
because that'll be so much more fun to role play out later.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.440
So if you're looking for weapons.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.980
I don't know, it'd be pretty fucking funny

19:46.980 --> 19:49.620
if Keith finds three bucks in that guy's center console

19:49.620 --> 19:51.900
and then comes in like, the debt is settled

19:51.900 --> 19:54.540
and he has no fucking clue what Keith's talking about.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.180
Make it so.

19:59.180 --> 20:01.240
That's what the bald man says, right?

20:01.240 --> 20:03.600
Yeah, zero, zero.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.480
If I roll a zero, that's a critical failure, right?

20:06.480 --> 20:07.320
That's 100?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.220
That's 100.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.060
Yeah.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.800
Good thing I just rolled that idly.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.620
I need to stop doing that.

20:14.620 --> 20:15.500
I know, I don't know.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.700
Luke, what do you want?

20:19.060 --> 20:20.700
I mean, I don't know.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.040
Give me something cool.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.260
Oh, okay, yeah, no, sorry.

20:24.260 --> 20:29.060
You open up the glove box and I will ask Joe and Thomas

20:29.060 --> 20:30.900
to take your headphones off.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.080
Luke, when Keith Vigna reaches into the console

20:34.080 --> 20:38.220
and opens it, there is a piece of paper,

20:38.220 --> 20:42.020
standard, eight and a half by 11, folded four times,

20:42.020 --> 20:45.600
and when you unfold it, it is a picture of you,

20:45.600 --> 20:49.340
Keith Vigna, handwritten underneath it.

20:49.340 --> 20:52.980
It says, bring alive.

20:52.980 --> 20:54.200
Oh shit.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.000
You also find a mag light.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.840
Okay.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.480
Like one of those long, hefty mag lights,

20:59.480 --> 21:02.240
so now you've got like a legit flashlight

21:02.240 --> 21:05.440
as well as basically a lead pipe as far as.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.280
Tight, tight.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.240
You can do some serious damage with the guy.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.060
Okey-doke.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.160
I found an atom bomb.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.400
Actually, we're trying to go more woke.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.280
It's an Eve bomb.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.120
What's that?

21:18.120 --> 21:19.120
Oh shit.

21:19.400 --> 21:24.400
So I hit the red button and I explode the atom bomb.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.000
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.300
Yeah, probably dying if Luke blows up the atom bomb.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.140
I asked him what he wanted.

21:37.140 --> 21:42.140
No, no, I'm fishing around in the truck bed

21:42.640 --> 21:45.240
trying to pull Jimmy Sanders out of the water.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.080
Yeah, okay.

21:46.080 --> 21:50.280
As you grab onto his arm, he kind of surfaces

21:50.280 --> 21:51.800
and he's like.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.240
I gave him two big slaps.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.480
Two big slaps?

21:56.480 --> 21:58.600
Okay, roll unarmed combat.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.640
Okay, 87.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.800
I pass with a 32.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.880
Nope, I failed.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.560
He dodges out of the way of both slaps

22:09.560 --> 22:13.080
and dives back underneath the water

22:13.120 --> 22:16.240
as you hear the front door open.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.420
I turn to look at that.

22:17.420 --> 22:21.880
You see, Luka Fajevic, this super burly,

22:21.880 --> 22:24.880
quite short, wide dude comes out,

22:24.880 --> 22:27.960
these bright white teeth looking like Rocky.

22:27.960 --> 22:32.960
He comes out first and he has got a crowbar in his hand.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.000
Hey, who the fuck?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.760
And he looks and he, of course,

22:36.760 --> 22:40.120
he sees Keith Vigna inside of the truck

22:40.120 --> 22:45.120
and he sees John Lee Pettymore III standing in the driveway.

22:45.480 --> 22:49.080
Oh, Terrence, Terrence, hey man, get over here.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.400
We found him.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.240
He came to us.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.420
He's just right here.

22:52.420 --> 22:53.960
Let's fucking get him.

22:53.960 --> 22:58.640
And Fajevic is coming straight for you and he is.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.840
He's walking here.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.920
And Terrence Liger is following behind

23:06.920 --> 23:11.160
but does not seem to have any sort of weapon

23:11.160 --> 23:12.840
in his hand currently.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.720
Keith motherfucking beans, you piece of shit.

23:16.720 --> 23:21.480
And he comes out and he's reaching behind him currently

23:21.480 --> 23:22.680
in his back pocket.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.320
Clark Bishop, it is your turn

23:24.320 --> 23:26.540
and you are walking in the back door currently.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.640
I wanna get to Randy.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.360
Is he still on the ground?

23:30.360 --> 23:31.960
Oh, God, yes.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.800
We're here to help you.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.620
We're here to help you.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.460
Hang on.

23:34.460 --> 23:35.280
Yes, shh.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.120
Find cover, find cover.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.680
I wanna kind of walk past him to the front.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.400
I mean, I'm sneaking up on the guys.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.240
You can do that.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.360
He's gonna crawl into his fireplace.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.020
Does it smell like Randy shit his pants?

23:45.020 --> 23:45.860
Oh, no.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.160
And the house just reeks of,

23:51.160 --> 23:55.560
it's like the heat is turned up super, super high

23:55.560 --> 23:57.920
because it is pretty cold out today.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.000
It's been a temperate December so far

24:00.000 --> 24:03.480
but this is certainly the coldest it's been,

24:03.480 --> 24:06.240
mostly so that the animals would have somewhere

24:06.240 --> 24:09.320
to be for a while and I could really get that plot going.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.040
But, so as it's gotten much colder,

24:13.040 --> 24:15.680
Randy has got the heat turned way up.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.880
So it's like that thing where you fart in the shower

24:18.880 --> 24:21.000
and the heat just like keeps it down.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.560
What?

24:23.560 --> 24:24.400
Do you not know what I'm talking about?

24:24.400 --> 24:26.000
I know what you're talking about.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.240
What do you mean keeps it down?

24:28.240 --> 24:30.540
It keeps it down.

24:30.540 --> 24:33.200
Like permeates it.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.840
Keeps it down wasn't really the right-

24:35.840 --> 24:38.640
No, cause like heat rises and farts are heat.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.360
You're saying you fart up the whole shower

24:41.360 --> 24:42.600
and it keeps it in there.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.760
Yeah, because like the steam is sitting on top of the fart

24:45.760 --> 24:47.560
cause the fart can't make it through the steam, right?

24:47.560 --> 24:50.720
And so the fart is just like where your head is

24:50.720 --> 24:52.200
cause the steam's right above that.

24:52.200 --> 24:57.200
Where's your head at in your farts, in your fart?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.920
No, that doesn't happen to me when I fart in the shower.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.520
Whatever loser.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.920
All right, so you guys are,

25:09.080 --> 25:11.920
Randy Yanks' house smells like shit cause it's hot fart.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.280
Farting out so many shit particles

25:14.280 --> 25:17.760
that they're able to attach to like the water droplets

25:17.760 --> 25:18.600
and permeate the air.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.720
Well, I'm not going to poop before I get in the shower.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.000
I'm not saying you should, but,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.160
oh wait, actually you should.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.000
There's nothing worse than-

25:26.000 --> 25:28.120
There's literally, it's the worst feeling on earth.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.400
The humid after shower shit.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.460
Getting a hot shower, taking a shit

25:32.580 --> 25:35.540
and just having the toilet paper just soggy and-

25:35.540 --> 25:37.380
Oh my God.

25:37.380 --> 25:38.220
Oh God.

25:38.220 --> 25:39.060
Just poop in the shower.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.620
And then you take another shower.

25:40.620 --> 25:42.780
Yep, a minute second shower.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.100
And cheese grate it.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.260
Just smash it down.

25:45.260 --> 25:46.940
Is that where you just stomp it?

25:46.940 --> 25:49.140
Oh yeah, I knew it had a name.

25:49.140 --> 25:51.060
Pour some shampoo on it to clean it.

25:51.060 --> 25:53.820
Pour some shampoo on it.

25:53.820 --> 25:57.460
Thomas is here for these songs.

25:57.460 --> 25:58.300
Dang, I love it.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.980
I can't wait until we're all in one room

25:59.980 --> 26:01.220
and we can sing together.

26:01.220 --> 26:03.820
Oh my God, I miss it.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.620
Smells like shit in this house.

26:05.620 --> 26:07.300
Keith Vigna, it's your turn.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.860
I help Randy into the fireplace and I say,

26:09.860 --> 26:11.780
dude, it smells like a shower fart in here.

26:11.780 --> 26:16.780
I'm so sorry, it's just that the heat is pushing it down.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.460
Joe, real fucking talk,

26:20.460 --> 26:21.740
does it happen to you in the shower?

26:21.740 --> 26:26.580
I don't know the science behind it, but yes, it does.

26:26.580 --> 26:29.420
Yes, I feel like when I fart in the shower, I get nothing.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.860
Like it dissipates better.

26:31.860 --> 26:33.980
When we're in the shower together.

26:33.980 --> 26:36.980
Oh yeah, when we're all pressed together, then yeah.

26:36.980 --> 26:39.100
Like obviously, right.

26:39.100 --> 26:42.140
I also can't wait until we're all in one room to do that.

26:42.140 --> 26:43.780
Right, that's how we usually record

26:43.780 --> 26:46.100
all naked together in a shower.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.620
It's just the audio quality is so much better.

26:49.620 --> 26:52.300
Well, I mean, that's the work you put in

26:52.300 --> 26:55.340
to take the shower sounds out of each track.

26:55.340 --> 26:58.780
And I know that takes you roughly 72 hours per track.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.540
It's a lot of music and rubber ducky in the background.

27:02.540 --> 27:03.620
You got to edit all that out.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.140
That's the work that goes into each podcast, y'all,

27:06.140 --> 27:09.020
before this horrible quarantine situation

27:09.020 --> 27:11.580
where we can't shower and record together anymore.

27:11.580 --> 27:14.100
Heartbreaking is what I would call that.

27:14.100 --> 27:14.940
Fartbreaking.

27:14.940 --> 27:17.260
Honestly, we have it the worst.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.820
Keith Vigna, you are...

27:23.700 --> 27:24.540
That was a good one.

27:24.540 --> 27:27.220
Keith, you're in the cab of this truck

27:27.220 --> 27:29.940
as these two men walk outside.

27:29.940 --> 27:30.780
What do you do?

27:30.780 --> 27:34.340
I see them, I jump out of the truck,

27:34.340 --> 27:38.660
I get my gun, and I yell,

27:38.660 --> 27:40.860
don't come any closer, I'll shoot.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.180
And when the camera pans back to me,

27:43.180 --> 27:45.220
I've got the gun up to my own head.

27:45.220 --> 27:47.060
Yes!

27:47.060 --> 27:48.780
Chomp, chomping right there.

27:48.780 --> 27:51.060
Hell yes, hell yes.

27:51.060 --> 27:52.500
Oh, you get 10 luck.

27:52.500 --> 27:53.340
Hell yeah.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.500
Nice, hell yeah.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.900
Thomas, do the same thing.

27:57.220 --> 28:00.420
He puts the watch on.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.340
I put my gun to Keith's head.

28:07.780 --> 28:10.500
Okay, John Lee, Betty Moore III, what are you doing?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.580
Trevor, Trevor is his name?

28:12.580 --> 28:13.420
Nope, Terrence.

28:13.420 --> 28:14.420
Terrence, Terrence.

28:14.420 --> 28:16.060
You've known this guy for years.

28:16.060 --> 28:16.900
Yeah, John has.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.820
You've heard me talk about him forever.

28:18.820 --> 28:21.260
Terrence has his hand on his gun, right?

28:21.260 --> 28:22.580
But the other guy does not.

28:22.580 --> 28:24.820
The other guy's holding a crowbar.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.580
Oh yeah, I just start firing at them,

28:26.580 --> 28:29.260
trying to suppress them and get them back into the house.

28:29.260 --> 28:33.100
Okay, roll firearms and who are you firing at?

28:33.100 --> 28:35.100
Both of them or are you just doing suppressing fire?

28:35.100 --> 28:36.740
Are you actually trying to hit somebody?

28:36.740 --> 28:37.580
Crowbar guy.

28:37.580 --> 28:38.420
Fade.

28:38.420 --> 28:39.860
I wanna leave the other one for Luke.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.540
Very kind.

28:41.540 --> 28:43.260
That's just good storytelling right there.

28:43.260 --> 28:45.100
That's friendship storytelling.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.260
It's like it would be smarter

28:46.260 --> 28:48.500
to take out the guy with the gun, but.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.340
Yeah, probably.

28:50.180 --> 28:55.180
47 on a six D.

28:56.900 --> 28:57.980
Roll a D 10.

28:57.980 --> 28:58.820
Three.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.940
All right, three will be a shoulder hit

29:00.940 --> 29:03.980
as John Lee Pettymore pulls his firearm

29:03.980 --> 29:08.820
and hits Luca Fade Fudgevitz right in the shoulder.

29:08.820 --> 29:12.180
Hands off your fucking gun, drop the crowbar.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.660
So you fire at him while yelling that

29:14.660 --> 29:18.180
and this just like jacked dude.

29:18.180 --> 29:21.300
You know Fade is the guy who has just been like

29:21.300 --> 29:25.980
hanging out on his front lawn for the past like four years,

29:25.980 --> 29:28.460
only doing like arm day.

29:28.460 --> 29:31.100
Like he only gives a fuck about his upper body.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.300
So he's got these little chicken legs now,

29:33.300 --> 29:35.180
whereas you know, like when he was younger,

29:35.180 --> 29:37.740
he used to be like a bodybuilder

29:37.740 --> 29:40.020
and now he's just given up on his legs.

29:40.020 --> 29:41.740
He's got this massive upper body

29:41.740 --> 29:43.460
and as soon as you shoot him in the shoulder,

29:43.460 --> 29:45.620
he drops the crowbar and he's like,

29:45.700 --> 29:47.780
ow, ow, what the fuck, man?

29:47.780 --> 29:50.580
They didn't know he couldn't do that, man.

29:50.580 --> 29:53.340
Luca, are you just that nice, man?

29:53.340 --> 29:55.900
It's just Fade, it's me, man.

29:55.900 --> 29:59.140
Fade, I'm sorry about your sick lats,

29:59.140 --> 30:03.140
but you're coming at some police officers.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.580
You gotta put those weapons down.

30:04.580 --> 30:08.620
I know, you're police officers, what?

30:08.620 --> 30:11.540
And he like slumps up against the garage,

30:11.540 --> 30:13.860
like backs into the garage

30:13.860 --> 30:16.380
and then slumps down the white garage door,

30:16.380 --> 30:20.740
leaving a trail of red as he like hits his butt

30:20.740 --> 30:22.940
on the concrete below and he's like,

30:22.940 --> 30:25.660
man, we just want Keith, man.

30:25.660 --> 30:29.220
This is my voice now forever, man.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.380
Keith's with us.

30:30.380 --> 30:32.860
And as you say Keith's with us,

30:32.860 --> 30:37.260
Terrence Licker holds his gun at his head.

30:37.260 --> 30:41.020
Keith, Vigna, you think you can play mind games with me?

30:41.060 --> 30:44.140
You think you were here about the smartest man in town,

30:44.140 --> 30:47.420
but I think otherwise with Anya, for sure.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.140
Terrence, is his back to the door?

30:53.140 --> 30:54.060
It is.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.780
I wanna sneak up and wrestle away the gun from him,

30:56.780 --> 30:58.260
from behind him.

30:58.260 --> 31:00.100
I feel like I should get some kind of advantage on that.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.300
He doesn't know I'm in there.

31:02.300 --> 31:03.500
He doesn't know I'm in there.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.460
He's got it up against his head.

31:05.460 --> 31:06.940
So how are you doing that?

31:06.940 --> 31:08.060
Pulling his arm backwards

31:08.060 --> 31:09.420
so it's gonna hurt his arm some

31:09.460 --> 31:11.740
and get the gun pointed not at his head.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.140
And I'm trying to get it out of his hand.

31:13.140 --> 31:14.420
I'm trying to take it for my own.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.060
I'll give you an option.

31:16.060 --> 31:17.900
I will either let you do this

31:17.900 --> 31:20.220
if you can pass a stealth check

31:20.220 --> 31:25.180
or I'll just give you a bonus on your unarmed combat.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.820
I'll take the bonus on the unarmed.

31:26.820 --> 31:29.300
Okay, so he'll roll against you on that.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.140
Go ahead and roll that unarmed combat.

31:35.940 --> 31:37.060
What's my bonus?

31:37.060 --> 31:40.940
Oh, you get a plus 20.

31:41.980 --> 31:43.660
You sure it's not plus 30, right?

31:45.460 --> 31:47.820
So as you go to grab this guy's gun,

31:47.820 --> 31:51.060
his hands go straight up in the air, the gun fires,

31:51.060 --> 31:53.820
and then the gun falls to the ground

31:53.820 --> 31:55.900
out of the reach of either one of you.

31:55.900 --> 32:00.500
It flings itself as it's firing up out of your hands

32:00.500 --> 32:04.780
and you two are just standing right outside the front door

32:04.780 --> 32:08.220
almost to the driveway of Randy Angst's home,

32:08.220 --> 32:10.940
gun 10 feet away in the grass.

32:10.940 --> 32:11.780
Keith Vigna.

32:11.780 --> 32:15.580
I want to run at him with the mag light

32:15.580 --> 32:17.860
and try to whack him in the head.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.300
Yeah, yeah, okay.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.420
Actually, so he crit failed with a 99.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.060
Okay, do I need to roll anything?

32:26.060 --> 32:26.900
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.740
Melee weapons.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.780
An eight on a 30.

32:30.780 --> 32:31.820
Hell yeah, tweet.

32:31.860 --> 32:35.380
So basically whatever you want to happen

32:35.380 --> 32:37.900
can happen here close to it.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.500
As the scuffle's going on or whatever,

32:39.500 --> 32:41.820
the gun goes off, I holster my gun,

32:41.820 --> 32:45.580
grab the flashlight from the front seat,

32:45.580 --> 32:49.460
run over to him and just like right in the teeth,

32:49.460 --> 32:50.580
hit him with the mag light.

32:50.580 --> 32:54.500
Oof, roll a D6.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.340
Three.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.180
You shoot him in the shoulder.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.900
It's a joke about how three damage did that earlier.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.380
Fucking nailed it.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.220
Trust it in.

33:04.940 --> 33:07.380
So you hit him right in the mouth

33:07.380 --> 33:11.900
and two teeth go flying as he hits the ground.

33:11.900 --> 33:15.140
Clark, he is like pushed into you by this movement

33:15.140 --> 33:18.140
and you are now in between him and the gun

33:18.140 --> 33:22.340
and he is now prone on the ground, bleeding from his mouth.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.820
Luka Fajevic's fade is also on the ground

33:25.820 --> 33:28.940
with a gunshot wound in his shoulder bleeding

33:28.940 --> 33:32.620
and Thomas is taking off his robe.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.780
All right, there it is.

33:39.780 --> 33:42.180
Oh, Luke is going shirtless as well.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.020
Here we go.

33:43.900 --> 33:47.540
I like the beanie with the shirtless look, Thomas.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.300
It's a good combo there.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.180
Thank you, it's cold in my house.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.020
Oh.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.140
You guys both have great nips.

33:59.140 --> 33:59.980
Thanks.

33:59.980 --> 34:00.820
Am I allowed to say that?

34:00.820 --> 34:02.300
No.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.140
Oh, okay.

34:03.140 --> 34:04.780
Luke, you've got great nips.

34:04.780 --> 34:06.380
It's an invasion of my privacy.

34:07.940 --> 34:09.020
Stop looking at me.

34:14.660 --> 34:17.060
I have no idea where I was.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.460
Oh no, did our distraction work?

34:22.020 --> 34:27.020
Well, it's not like the NPCs were destroying you guys

34:28.260 --> 34:30.540
so you were trying to distract me.

34:30.540 --> 34:33.900
You've got this easily in hand, I believe, at this point.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.060
Oh, I know, it's just late.

34:35.060 --> 34:37.220
It is John Lee Pettymore's turn.

34:47.220 --> 34:48.980
And obviously, John Lee Pettymore knows

34:48.980 --> 34:50.620
exactly what's going on

34:50.620 --> 34:54.420
because he wasn't wasting his time Zoom stripping.

34:54.420 --> 34:55.580
You're good at that, by the way.

34:55.580 --> 34:57.180
You might want to talk to Terrence Licker.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.740
So, John Lee Pettymore,

34:59.740 --> 35:02.220
you are looking at Luka Fade Fajevic

35:02.220 --> 35:04.300
who is bleeding up against the garage.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.580
You are looking at Keith Vigna

35:06.580 --> 35:11.180
who just took a mag light to the face of Terrence Licker

35:11.180 --> 35:13.860
who is now ass grounded.

35:13.860 --> 35:16.980
And you see Clark Bishop just to the right of them.

35:16.980 --> 35:18.620
Yes, I said ass grounded.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.140
And Clark Bishop is standing to the right of them,

35:22.140 --> 35:24.380
almost in the neighbor's yard at this point.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.300
But you guys are all just around this

35:26.300 --> 35:29.580
front of the house area and it is your turn currently.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.220
All right, so gun drawn.

35:31.220 --> 35:34.100
Don't move a fucking muscle, you're under arrest.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.620
He's not even a cop.

35:35.620 --> 35:37.900
I don't even think that one's a cop.

35:37.900 --> 35:40.860
It's complicated, but I am.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.500
You're under arrest.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.180
None of y'all wearing police uniform.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.380
Are you not even on duty?

35:46.380 --> 35:48.140
You ain't been around, the world is different.

35:48.460 --> 35:49.740
I shoot him in the leg.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.740
No, I don't, dude, I don't actually.

35:54.740 --> 35:58.180
So, okay, so he draws his gun and he says all that

35:58.180 --> 35:59.460
and he's like, I am a cop.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.060
Damn it.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.340
All right, John Lee Pettymore's having like a breakdown

36:05.340 --> 36:08.300
in the driveway, you cannot figure out what's going on.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.820
Shut up, that's not what happens.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.460
I'm such a strong man, why have I maimed him?

36:13.460 --> 36:18.460
All right, I'm advancing on them with my gun drawn.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.340
You're under arrest.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.380
For real, I'm a cop.

36:22.380 --> 36:26.420
Luca is the one closest to you and he's looking up at you

36:26.420 --> 36:29.020
from the ground up against the garage.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.300
Hey, hey, who are you?

36:31.300 --> 36:32.580
A cop, god damn.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.980
What, you're under arrest.

36:34.980 --> 36:37.380
What are you doing with this Keith Wigner fella?

36:37.380 --> 36:38.580
He's a cop too.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.500
Yeah, but you weren't a cop here before.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.500
I don't have time to explain any of this to you.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.220
I am ball, motherfucker.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.580
I slap him across the face and I handcuff him.

36:48.580 --> 36:52.300
Okay, so here's a pretty decent issue.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.060
You don't have any handcuffs.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.060
Don't I?

36:55.060 --> 36:56.140
No, you don't.

36:56.140 --> 37:00.180
You used your handcuffs on the body of Drew Andrews.

37:00.180 --> 37:01.260
That's right.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.660
No, no, no, no, no, those were Clark's handcuffs.

37:04.660 --> 37:05.500
Yes.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.620
But I don't know if you would have any.

37:06.620 --> 37:08.620
Didn't you give me feet and hand shackles

37:08.660 --> 37:11.140
because we said that that's what cops would use in the 70s?

37:11.140 --> 37:11.980
Yeah.

37:12.940 --> 37:17.500
But John Lee Pettymore is in the body of Kevin

37:17.500 --> 37:20.420
who is in all black tactical gear

37:20.420 --> 37:23.220
who has a lot of cool stuff,

37:23.220 --> 37:27.380
probably like a silencer and like a laser sight

37:27.380 --> 37:29.260
and like glow in the dark.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.580
Some handcuffs.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.300
Use laser cuffs on him.

37:33.300 --> 37:34.140
Okay, okay.

37:34.140 --> 37:37.700
If I'm fully like tactical, like survival loaded out,

37:37.740 --> 37:38.660
I zip tie him.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.660
There it is.

37:39.660 --> 37:41.340
I just needed you to think.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.180
Fuck off.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.020
Ah!

37:43.020 --> 37:45.140
All right.

37:45.140 --> 37:45.980
It's late.

37:48.980 --> 37:51.940
As you zip tie his hands,

37:51.940 --> 37:55.020
I need whoever has the best alertness or alertness.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.500
I got a 70.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.340
Clark has the bishop it is.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.580
Fuck me, a 73.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.500
I don't know if I've passed a role

38:04.500 --> 38:06.340
like in the last two episodes.

38:06.340 --> 38:07.180
Don't worry.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.820
I'm helping the podcast and the storyteller.

38:10.980 --> 38:14.340
We're like out of combat essentially at this point.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.180
Well, I'm gonna go pick up his gun.

38:16.180 --> 38:17.020
Okay, yeah, done.

38:17.020 --> 38:19.060
Yeah, I go over to him.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.740
Is he face down or face up?

38:20.740 --> 38:24.580
Clark, the gun is a little revolver, snub nose fella.

38:24.580 --> 38:28.980
And Luke Terence is face up, ass grounded.

38:28.980 --> 38:31.900
I go over to him and I just kind of like kick him

38:31.900 --> 38:35.340
with my foot and like shove him over,

38:35.340 --> 38:38.580
like roll him over to where he's on his stomach.

38:38.580 --> 38:41.340
I reach in to his back pocket and grab his wallet

38:41.340 --> 38:42.180
and look inside.

38:42.180 --> 38:45.020
Hey, hey man, there ain't no need to do that.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.460
What do I see inside the wallet?

38:46.460 --> 38:49.260
Inside Terence Licker's wallet.

38:50.820 --> 38:54.500
You know, he's got a punch card for Subtropolis

38:54.500 --> 38:59.500
and he's got his ID and he's got a few credit cards,

38:59.900 --> 39:04.540
like four or five credit cards, no debit card,

39:04.540 --> 39:07.020
no library card, certainly not.

39:07.020 --> 39:09.380
However, he's in Mensa.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.020
So he's got a little Mensa ID card.

39:11.020 --> 39:12.500
Does he have any cash on him?

39:12.500 --> 39:13.460
Cash?

39:13.460 --> 39:18.380
Go ahead and roll, roll a D20

39:18.380 --> 39:21.060
to see how many dollars are in here.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.300
Times 1000.

39:22.300 --> 39:23.900
$13.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.740
$13,000.

39:25.740 --> 39:29.740
So he's got a $5 bill and an $8 bill.

39:30.740 --> 39:35.020
No, 13 works out perfectly for you.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.580
I open it up, I see there's 13 bucks in there.

39:37.580 --> 39:41.460
I take the three ones, like hold it down by his face

39:41.460 --> 39:43.340
and I'm like, we're even now.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.900
And I like take the $10 bill and like rip it up

39:45.900 --> 39:49.620
in front of him and then stick the $3 in my pocket.

39:49.620 --> 39:50.700
I look at the guys, I'm like,

39:50.700 --> 39:52.820
should we go to the pond now?

39:57.060 --> 39:59.100
I'm glad you said that in front of these people.

39:59.140 --> 40:03.740
Keith, it seems like maybe more to the mystery.

40:03.740 --> 40:06.300
Yeah, sorry, I just, I kinda had.

40:06.300 --> 40:08.620
I think we might be able to unravel some more right here.

40:08.620 --> 40:10.300
You know, I focused in on the pond

40:10.300 --> 40:12.620
and then I focused in on my getting even with this guy.

40:12.620 --> 40:16.020
Sure, sure, I understand the $3 was your objective

40:16.020 --> 40:17.620
and as soon as that was complete,

40:17.620 --> 40:19.140
you're like, let's go, I get it.

40:19.140 --> 40:22.380
Once I kinda like get my bearings back,

40:22.380 --> 40:24.300
I look down at Terrence, hey,

40:24.300 --> 40:26.280
if you can still talk without your teeth,

40:26.280 --> 40:28.660
what's up with the bodies, why do you have this?

40:28.660 --> 40:31.620
And I show him the picture of me that I found in his truck.

40:31.620 --> 40:35.380
You son of a bitch, I ain't talking shit to you.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.500
Please, now you say that.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.540
I mean, you can roll.

40:39.540 --> 40:40.380
Torture.

40:42.660 --> 40:46.100
There are torture rules in the Delta Green handbook.

40:46.100 --> 40:48.140
Of course there are, it's Delta Green.

40:48.140 --> 40:51.820
Yeah, it's very legitimate and it uses willpower.

40:51.820 --> 40:53.220
You don't know them offhand,

40:53.220 --> 40:55.180
you fucking incompetent keeper.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.580
Oh, we don't play Delta Green.

40:57.100 --> 40:57.940
I know.

41:02.380 --> 41:06.580
And so, Luke, you need to roll

41:06.580 --> 41:10.940
either some sort of persuade or law.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.500
Okay, I got a pretty good persuade.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.060
Or you can go psychotherapy

41:14.060 --> 41:15.260
if you wanna like try to turn a mind for it.

41:15.260 --> 41:16.980
I got a four on a 70.

41:16.980 --> 41:19.640
I ain't talking to you, I ain't giving you shit.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.860
I wad up the picture of me and I'm like,

41:21.860 --> 41:23.060
well, if you're not gonna talk

41:23.060 --> 41:24.940
and I like shove it into his mouth.

41:27.420 --> 41:29.980
Can I like talk now?

41:29.980 --> 41:31.900
Okay, yeah, I'll talk now.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.340
I didn't like having you inside my mouth.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.300
Nobody does.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.100
Hey, did we take that little bit of carpet

41:38.100 --> 41:40.260
that we were shoving down Drew's throat

41:41.180 --> 41:42.500
to see where people were?

41:42.500 --> 41:45.180
I can't imagine that you didn't take it.

41:45.180 --> 41:46.980
I mean, maybe it works on any throat.

41:46.980 --> 41:48.900
We could just find out whatever we want.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.860
Jesus, keep that in the back pocket.

41:51.860 --> 41:53.580
Between that and the watch,

41:53.580 --> 41:56.300
we've broken your game wide open, Zach.

41:56.860 --> 41:57.900
I gave it to you.

41:58.780 --> 41:59.620
Use it.

42:01.980 --> 42:03.420
So he spits it out.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.180
Am I gonna have to keep going?

42:05.180 --> 42:07.620
No, I told you I had talked to you now.

42:07.620 --> 42:09.120
What do you want?

42:09.120 --> 42:09.960
We're supposed to find you.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.860
What are you doing here?

42:11.860 --> 42:12.980
We're collecting.

42:12.980 --> 42:14.140
What are you doing here?

42:14.140 --> 42:16.020
Why do you have a picture of me?

42:16.020 --> 42:19.180
And what's this with the bodies and disappearing?

42:19.180 --> 42:20.780
Yeah, what do you want with Randy?

42:20.780 --> 42:22.860
Okay, the last question

42:22.860 --> 42:24.900
and the first question are the same.

42:24.940 --> 42:28.220
So I will say that we're collecting.

42:28.220 --> 42:29.740
We need more bodies.

42:29.740 --> 42:30.860
Daddy needs more bodies.

42:30.860 --> 42:31.700
For what?

42:31.700 --> 42:32.780
I don't know if you've noticed,

42:32.780 --> 42:36.200
but the world is completely off its filter

42:36.200 --> 42:39.180
and daddy's gonna make everything better.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.620
How's he gonna do that with bodies?

42:40.620 --> 42:41.460
He's gonna go back.

42:41.460 --> 42:43.020
He's gonna make everything better.

42:43.020 --> 42:47.100
Do the bodies get to live after you're done with them?

42:47.100 --> 42:48.140
Well, yeah, of course.

42:48.140 --> 42:49.840
Everything's gonna go back to normal.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.820
We're gonna go back to normal.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.740
How are you, hold on, how are you using these bodies?

42:55.740 --> 42:57.580
Well, we gotta sacrifice all these bodies

42:57.580 --> 43:00.260
so that daddy can go back

43:00.260 --> 43:03.500
and make sure everything's normal from here on out, right?

43:03.500 --> 43:05.700
So if he goes back and fixes everything,

43:05.700 --> 43:07.460
then it won't be this way now.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.700
You damn fool.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.660
Daddy doesn't wanna take things back to the way they were.

43:10.660 --> 43:12.080
Who the fuck are you?

43:12.080 --> 43:14.140
Daddy wants to consolidate his power.

43:14.140 --> 43:15.820
I'd like to walk up now and say,

43:16.880 --> 43:18.060
you keep saying go back.

43:18.060 --> 43:20.460
What do you mean by daddy wants to go back?

43:20.460 --> 43:21.700
In time.

43:22.540 --> 43:24.020
He's doing this with a sacrifice?

43:24.020 --> 43:25.260
Well, if we have enough bodies,

43:25.260 --> 43:26.700
we'll be able to make it happen.

43:26.700 --> 43:28.440
Did daddy explain this to you

43:28.440 --> 43:31.580
or is this something that you've learned recently?

43:31.580 --> 43:33.820
How do you know about how this is gonna work?

43:33.820 --> 43:35.740
Daddy explained it to everyone

43:35.740 --> 43:40.740
and everyone at the First Creek family of contention knows

43:41.620 --> 43:45.460
we need more bodies so that we can do the sacrifice

43:45.460 --> 43:48.740
so that daddy can go back and fix everything.

43:48.740 --> 43:50.620
You willing to sacrifice your body?

43:50.660 --> 43:51.860
How many bodies you're gonna need?

43:51.860 --> 43:53.580
No, I'm just a collector.

43:53.580 --> 43:54.500
How many have you got?

43:54.500 --> 43:55.320
Me?

43:55.320 --> 43:56.160
I'm not winning.

43:57.580 --> 43:58.400
But-

43:58.400 --> 44:00.860
He incentivized it into some kind of competition?

44:00.860 --> 44:02.460
Well, of course you're not gonna collect

44:02.460 --> 44:03.840
without a competition.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.060
What do you win? What does winner get?

44:05.060 --> 44:06.380
Winning gets whatever they want.

44:06.380 --> 44:07.620
What do the losers get?

44:07.620 --> 44:09.460
Well, the losers still fought the family

44:09.460 --> 44:11.180
so ain't nobody really a loser.

44:11.180 --> 44:12.820
But do they have to give their bodies?

44:12.820 --> 44:15.220
Everybody giving their body, we all gonna die.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.500
We're all dying anyway.

44:16.500 --> 44:17.980
There ain't no living here.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.340
Have you seen contention?

44:19.340 --> 44:20.940
There ain't no living here.

44:20.940 --> 44:23.980
The only change we have having a real life is going back

44:23.980 --> 44:26.020
and daddy can go back and fix everything.

44:26.020 --> 44:27.100
If you don't wanna be a part of it,

44:27.100 --> 44:28.600
you need to go get on out of here,

44:28.600 --> 44:29.960
but we need to keep Keith

44:29.960 --> 44:32.860
because Keith is the key that's going back.

44:32.860 --> 44:33.900
Expand on that.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.060
Daddy needs Keith.

44:36.060 --> 44:38.260
So you just believe everything daddy tells you.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.900
And John, you look down, Clark, you look down as well,

44:40.900 --> 44:43.260
you see this piece of paper that he spit out

44:43.260 --> 44:45.660
that Keith Vigna shoved into his mouth

44:45.660 --> 44:49.020
is a picture of Keith Vigna.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.500
And below it, it says whatever I said earlier,

44:52.500 --> 44:55.220
but I'm gonna say, collect alive.

44:55.220 --> 44:57.860
I shoved the piece of carpet sample into his mouth

44:57.860 --> 44:59.180
and I say, daddy.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.620
What the fuck was that?

45:08.620 --> 45:10.220
And his eyes get real big

45:10.220 --> 45:13.060
and then he starts squirming, horrified.

45:13.060 --> 45:17.780
He is extremely, extremely scared

45:17.780 --> 45:19.660
of John Lee Pettymore the third.

45:19.660 --> 45:23.020
When he looks up and sees John Lee Pettymore

45:23.020 --> 45:26.460
after John shoves this piece of carpet into his throat,

45:26.460 --> 45:29.020
he freaks out and he's like, you're one of them.

45:29.020 --> 45:30.620
How did you get, you're one of them.

45:30.620 --> 45:33.180
It's in you, it's in you.

45:33.180 --> 45:34.720
See, I think it's in you.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.480
I think it's in all of you.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.840
What are you doing with Jimmy?

45:37.840 --> 45:40.860
As you say that, you hear like a little splash

45:40.860 --> 45:45.860
and Jimmy Sanders with his long unkempt hippie hair

45:46.340 --> 45:50.020
does the like Bond girl fling out of the water

45:50.020 --> 45:52.980
that's in the back of this truck and looks over at you.

45:52.980 --> 45:57.120
Hey, number six, you know, extra cucumber.

45:58.580 --> 46:00.920
It's not an oil spill, it lives here now.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.780
That's basically how Jimmy was before all this.

46:07.780 --> 46:09.020
So that's not, you know.

46:09.340 --> 46:12.980
Look at Terrence, are you using him to see the stuff?

46:12.980 --> 46:14.660
Oh yeah, of course we are.

46:14.660 --> 46:17.020
Right, because they use children and crazy people.

46:17.020 --> 46:18.060
Good job, Luke.

46:19.260 --> 46:20.940
Jimmy, do you see it on us?

46:20.940 --> 46:22.980
Oh, and you can't even approach Jimmy

46:22.980 --> 46:25.400
without him dipping into the water.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.820
As if he sees goo everywhere.

46:27.820 --> 46:30.100
No, it's specifically when he's looking at you

46:30.100 --> 46:31.560
and I need you to roll sanity.

46:31.560 --> 46:32.780
Me? Yes.

46:32.780 --> 46:35.140
Thomas, John is so fucked up that your cousin

46:35.140 --> 46:37.980
just keeps dunking his head in this water.

46:38.020 --> 46:40.860
Dude, 28 on a 25.

46:40.860 --> 46:44.700
Oh, you just lose one.

46:44.700 --> 46:46.500
But Luke and Joe, if you could take off

46:46.500 --> 46:47.900
your headphones real quick.

46:53.900 --> 46:55.220
Hey, Thomas.

46:55.220 --> 46:57.100
You just lose one sanity.

46:57.100 --> 46:59.480
However, you approached Jimmy Sanders

46:59.480 --> 47:02.580
who immediately like looks you in the face,

47:02.580 --> 47:07.580
gets extremely scared and then dips into the water

47:07.780 --> 47:10.500
and as you're turning back,

47:10.500 --> 47:13.260
you catch a reflection of yourself

47:13.260 --> 47:17.500
in the shotgun side mirror of this truck

47:17.500 --> 47:21.540
and there is black ooze dripping

47:21.540 --> 47:23.380
out of both of your nostrils,

47:23.380 --> 47:26.700
running down your face from both of your eyes,

47:26.700 --> 47:29.180
coming out maybe one of the sides of your mouth

47:29.180 --> 47:31.980
and running down from both of your ears

47:31.980 --> 47:35.080
and then you blink and it is not there

47:35.080 --> 47:37.140
and you look like you always do.

47:37.580 --> 47:38.420
Fuck.

47:44.940 --> 47:47.100
So you guys see Kevin Lee Pettymore

47:47.100 --> 47:49.100
take a step back from the truck

47:49.100 --> 47:51.080
and like he falls backwards.

47:51.080 --> 47:53.300
He lands on his ass.

47:53.300 --> 47:54.820
John, you all right?

47:54.820 --> 47:55.660
Trip there?

47:56.580 --> 47:58.340
I'm walking over to try to help you out.

47:58.340 --> 48:00.020
Oh, hey, yeah.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.500
Kinda just for a second there out of the corner of my eye,

48:05.260 --> 48:09.420
saw the goo running out of all my orifices,

48:09.420 --> 48:13.460
so I blinked, it was gone,

48:13.460 --> 48:15.860
but it was there real as day.

48:15.860 --> 48:16.780
Was it doing anything?

48:16.780 --> 48:18.020
Did it move?

48:18.020 --> 48:21.860
Just oozing, just oozing,

48:21.860 --> 48:23.740
coming out of my nose, holes in my.

48:23.740 --> 48:25.260
Should you take a dunk?

48:25.260 --> 48:27.640
And I look over at the truck.

48:27.640 --> 48:31.380
John's eyes get wide and he nods

48:31.380 --> 48:34.740
and he dives into that pool with Jimmy Sanders.

48:34.740 --> 48:36.800
You dive into it?

48:36.800 --> 48:40.720
I leap and I just body slam into the pool.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.680
Yeah, okay.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.420
Luke and Joe, I need you to take your headphones off again.

48:44.420 --> 48:45.260
Cool, cool, cool.

48:51.420 --> 48:55.620
John, as you break into the water,

48:55.620 --> 48:57.980
into this puddle that has been formed

48:57.980 --> 49:01.340
and teeming with fish in the back of this truck,

49:02.180 --> 49:05.500
your head vibrates like it's sizzling

49:05.500 --> 49:10.500
and you feel basically in your ears and in your nose,

49:10.500 --> 49:15.140
you feel like when your ears are super clogged up

49:15.140 --> 49:18.600
and then you pour hydrogen peroxide or something in there

49:18.600 --> 49:22.460
and it like bubbles up crazy, like insane bubbles.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.740
And all you can hear is like.

49:28.780 --> 49:31.300
And you feel it in your nose and it like tickles

49:32.140 --> 49:35.180
and there's something inside of your head

49:35.180 --> 49:40.180
that is just like throbbing and all of a sudden,

49:40.700 --> 49:42.860
you feel yourself rolling.

49:42.860 --> 49:47.780
You feel yourself rolling back and forth comfortably.

49:48.660 --> 49:53.660
It's a nostalgic feeling and it reminds you of family.

49:55.320 --> 49:58.340
It's warmth, it's comfort.

49:58.340 --> 49:59.260
You said come.

49:59.260 --> 50:01.100
You can feel.

50:01.100 --> 50:02.820
You said come for it.

50:07.020 --> 50:07.860
Gross.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.740
Welcome to Fort come.

50:13.220 --> 50:14.040
Okay, shit.

50:14.040 --> 50:19.040
So, ew, God, I just keep picturing like Santa Claus' workshop

50:22.820 --> 50:25.080
Yeah, cause it's like all the frosting and shit,

50:25.080 --> 50:26.140
but it's just gum.

50:26.980 --> 50:31.380
It's like a gingerbread house, but it's cum.

50:31.380 --> 50:32.580
Instead of peppermints,

50:32.580 --> 50:35.100
like there's just cock rings all over it and like.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.500
Too far.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.780
Oh boy.

50:37.780 --> 50:39.840
Yeah, you just feel yourself rolling back and forth

50:39.840 --> 50:42.940
and then you realize that you are rolling back and forth

50:42.940 --> 50:44.160
in a palm.

50:46.260 --> 50:47.100
Okay.

50:47.100 --> 50:49.300
And then you lift your head above the water

50:49.300 --> 50:50.580
and immediately.

50:56.980 --> 50:59.500
The smell is awful.

50:59.500 --> 51:00.340
Like a shower.

51:00.340 --> 51:03.540
There is a distinct stench.

51:03.540 --> 51:06.340
It is fishy, but it is rancid.

51:06.340 --> 51:09.120
It is overpoweringly stinky.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.420
After Jon lifts his head above the water,

51:11.420 --> 51:16.420
you all smell this and it is coming from the truck bed

51:16.620 --> 51:19.860
and it fucking reeks.

51:19.860 --> 51:21.900
Jon, I need you to roll constitution

51:21.900 --> 51:24.220
to not puke on your cousin.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.360
Which is lower than my constitution.

51:29.580 --> 51:31.180
What's your throw up like?

51:31.180 --> 51:32.500
It's nuts and bolts.

51:34.900 --> 51:39.120
Yeah, I imagine there's like some synthetic oils in it.

51:40.860 --> 51:43.060
Do androids dream of electric barf?

51:45.060 --> 51:46.460
You are mostly human.

51:46.460 --> 51:48.140
Then it's a mostly human barf,

51:48.140 --> 51:50.780
but there is still some motor oil in there.

51:50.780 --> 51:53.980
Yeah, that completely adds up for me.

51:54.580 --> 51:56.140
But mostly just because you've been drinking motor oil

51:56.140 --> 51:57.780
the whole way back to contention.

51:57.780 --> 51:59.220
Stop or we're gonna have to stop

51:59.220 --> 52:01.000
for you to pee again, Thomas.

52:01.000 --> 52:01.900
Oh my.

52:01.900 --> 52:06.900
So he just yaks all up in this puddle that has been created.

52:07.760 --> 52:10.640
And Jimmy Sanders is, it doesn't live here.

52:11.980 --> 52:16.000
He's just got extra meat.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.380
And then he's gonna stand up

52:19.380 --> 52:21.500
and then he's gonna sit back down.

52:21.540 --> 52:23.380
It's a confusing guy, Jimmy Sanders.

52:24.340 --> 52:27.700
Hey there, he got a, what the?

52:27.700 --> 52:29.620
That man over there, he licked himself,

52:29.620 --> 52:31.740
freaked out, jumped in there and started throwing up.

52:31.740 --> 52:34.460
What's going, it smelled like shit, y'all been.

52:34.460 --> 52:35.860
Other than the presence of that smell,

52:35.860 --> 52:37.860
has anything changed at all?

52:37.860 --> 52:39.980
Like, can I tell a source of the smell?

52:39.980 --> 52:41.620
It's just when he popped up from the water

52:41.620 --> 52:42.460
and came from the truck.

52:42.460 --> 52:44.100
Then the truck started smelling terrible, yeah.

52:44.100 --> 52:46.040
Jimmy, do you see any goo?

52:47.300 --> 52:50.060
Oh, Jimmy doesn't just like answer questions.

52:50.060 --> 52:51.700
Right, I figured, but.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.820
He's just like talking this whole time.

52:53.820 --> 52:58.180
He's always talking and he's always just like,

52:58.180 --> 53:00.180
yeah, of course you'd have a number one,

53:00.180 --> 53:02.740
but like, you can't have that without living here.

53:02.740 --> 53:06.020
I mean, the oil is extra tomatoes, but the split,

53:06.020 --> 53:08.220
you know, I can't cut it in half for the reasons,

53:08.220 --> 53:09.780
you know, he's vegetarian.

53:09.780 --> 53:12.540
I'm a pescatarian, but I only eat meat.

53:12.540 --> 53:17.200
I look over at Terrence, how do you get,

53:17.200 --> 53:19.500
how do you get him to tell you about the ooze?

53:19.780 --> 53:21.460
Oh, he just screams normally.

53:21.460 --> 53:23.620
Okay, so you don't think there's any around us right now?

53:23.620 --> 53:25.060
I mean, it smells, don't it?

53:25.060 --> 53:26.540
Something just happened.

53:26.540 --> 53:28.100
Does it smell like the ooze?

53:28.100 --> 53:29.900
Clearly, your bar just dumped in there

53:29.900 --> 53:31.060
because he was trying to avoid it.

53:31.060 --> 53:33.980
We couldn't see it, but your friends there is crazy.

53:33.980 --> 53:35.100
I want y'all to know that.

53:35.100 --> 53:36.660
He could have seen it, he jumped in there,

53:36.660 --> 53:38.060
and now it smells, of course it does,

53:38.060 --> 53:40.100
because when the fifth gets smelled, it smells like it.

53:40.100 --> 53:41.700
I'm gonna yell over to John.

53:41.700 --> 53:42.900
John, are you all right?

53:42.900 --> 53:45.180
What's going on?

53:45.180 --> 53:46.020
You all right?

53:46.020 --> 53:47.580
John lifts his head out of the water

53:47.580 --> 53:51.820
and smells the smell, sees that Jimmy's not screaming,

53:51.820 --> 53:56.820
and he's like, I am now, I'm all right now, maybe.

53:57.460 --> 53:59.220
I don't really know how this works.

53:59.220 --> 54:02.260
No, it seems tricky, I don't know either.

54:02.260 --> 54:06.580
I mean, you're, hey, hey, Keith Vigna, psh,

54:06.580 --> 54:07.780
your friend is crazy.

54:07.780 --> 54:10.020
The one who's not a cop, Clark.

54:10.020 --> 54:12.900
The one who's not a cop, he's crazy.

54:12.900 --> 54:14.820
He can see it, he's losing his shit.

54:14.820 --> 54:16.420
I don't believe you.

54:16.860 --> 54:18.140
How would you know that?

54:18.140 --> 54:19.820
Because he saw it, and then he jumped in,

54:19.820 --> 54:20.940
and now it smells.

54:20.940 --> 54:23.900
When the puddles get teemed, right,

54:23.900 --> 54:25.580
they got fish in them, right?

54:25.580 --> 54:27.300
But when the fish collect,

54:27.300 --> 54:28.740
we're doing collecting of people,

54:28.740 --> 54:31.060
fish doing collecting of residue,

54:31.060 --> 54:32.900
when the fish collect, it smells.

54:32.900 --> 54:36.500
So this smell is from collecting residue.

54:38.500 --> 54:41.300
Is it time for me to appear now?

54:41.300 --> 54:45.660
And you see Randy Angston in a very nice blue

54:45.700 --> 54:49.900
three-piece suit, except for instead of the pants that match,

54:49.900 --> 54:51.500
he's wearing sweatpants.

54:51.500 --> 54:54.780
Hello, I'm Randy Angst.

54:54.780 --> 54:57.220
What do you know about all this?

54:57.220 --> 54:58.620
Well, is it safe?

54:59.660 --> 55:01.260
What do you know about all this?

55:01.260 --> 55:04.420
I'm the one who's scared, you're out here running around.

55:04.420 --> 55:08.420
Do you know anything else other than what daddy wants?

55:08.420 --> 55:10.100
Who the fuck is daddy?

55:10.100 --> 55:12.540
I think it's the pastor.

55:12.660 --> 55:16.220
Oh, that fucking piece of shit, little turd nugget.

55:16.220 --> 55:18.220
That's the impression we get, yeah.

55:18.220 --> 55:22.060
Ever since he lost his family, he's been a real dick.

55:22.060 --> 55:27.060
Oh, he lost his, how did he lose his family?

55:27.740 --> 55:29.460
He died in a car crash.

55:30.540 --> 55:35.540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

55:38.620 --> 55:40.260
Hey, yeah, remember?

55:40.260 --> 55:41.660
Oh, no.

55:41.700 --> 55:45.300
Remember that burning, that burning vehicle

55:45.300 --> 55:47.540
with the family inside?

55:49.100 --> 55:52.580
I bet it was, his family was kind of burnt up.

55:52.580 --> 55:54.900
Didn't we save one of them?

55:54.900 --> 55:57.020
Not enough, I guess.

55:57.020 --> 56:00.860
I mean, I pulled somebody out of there.

56:00.860 --> 56:01.980
I pulled someone out of that.

56:01.980 --> 56:03.740
But people perished, right?

56:04.940 --> 56:05.780
Yeah, for sure.

56:05.780 --> 56:08.300
There's like a wife and maybe a couple kids.

56:09.300 --> 56:12.220
Why do you think these things are connected?

56:12.220 --> 56:13.820
That happened a couple days ago.

56:15.940 --> 56:17.860
Well, just because we hadn't, you know,

56:17.860 --> 56:20.540
we weren't getting much of a ruckus out of the pastor

56:20.540 --> 56:23.860
until, you know, maybe he could have directly linked us

56:23.860 --> 56:25.380
to his family's demise.

56:25.380 --> 56:26.740
Terrence, when did his family die?

56:26.740 --> 56:27.780
Tell me when his family died.

56:27.780 --> 56:29.820
Years and years ago, right?

56:29.820 --> 56:33.420
No, it was you guys, and it was a couple days ago.

56:33.420 --> 56:36.020
It was right before you skipped town.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.980
So-called contention police officers.

56:38.980 --> 56:40.260
I believe you murdered three-

56:40.260 --> 56:43.300
One thing you need to know is that we did not skip town.

56:43.300 --> 56:45.100
Everything we've done between here and now,

56:45.100 --> 56:48.180
like the outset of all this and now, is to save this town.

56:48.180 --> 56:50.180
And the only thing that's happened since then

56:50.180 --> 56:53.060
is that we've lost almost our entire population

56:53.060 --> 56:56.260
of contention, and the pastor who's now taken over

56:56.260 --> 56:59.060
lost his wife, his daughter, and his son

56:59.060 --> 57:01.700
in a car accident that was caused by you

57:01.700 --> 57:03.260
and all of your tomfoolery.

57:03.260 --> 57:05.020
No, no, no, now wait a minute.

57:05.060 --> 57:09.140
We're not the ones gathering up the population's bodies.

57:09.140 --> 57:13.140
No, I got, I saved, I saved, I saved the son.

57:13.140 --> 57:15.580
I saved the son, I did what I could.

57:15.580 --> 57:18.740
No, you must have failed a role there right at the end.

57:18.740 --> 57:20.660
I think there was one specific role

57:20.660 --> 57:23.180
that would have saved him, and it was right before

57:23.180 --> 57:26.180
he took off in the ambulance, and it was a failed role.

57:27.100 --> 57:28.380
So that killed a child.

57:29.420 --> 57:33.340
And gave us our main enemy for this situation.

57:35.540 --> 57:37.060
I look at the other two guys.

57:37.060 --> 57:39.300
What are we gonna do with these guys?

57:39.300 --> 57:41.460
We can't let him go back to the pastor.

57:41.460 --> 57:43.580
Luca is asleep.

57:43.580 --> 57:47.180
I think the pain and the shock have gotten to him,

57:47.180 --> 57:51.380
and he is eyes closed up against the garage door.

57:51.380 --> 57:54.420
And there's a trail of blood now making its way

57:54.420 --> 57:56.940
at, it's about halfway down the driveway.

57:56.940 --> 57:59.140
I'm gonna go back inside if it's all good to you.

57:59.140 --> 58:00.540
It's much more comfortable.

58:00.540 --> 58:02.220
So you're not helping out the pastor at all?

58:02.220 --> 58:03.580
No, we need you out here, Randy.

58:03.580 --> 58:04.580
No, God, no.

58:05.060 --> 58:07.580
That cane you had in there, it had a Rubik's Cube on it.

58:07.580 --> 58:09.860
Do you have a bunch of different canes?

58:09.860 --> 58:11.220
No, that's my cane.

58:11.220 --> 58:13.620
Was there ever a tooth one?

58:13.620 --> 58:16.940
I love my cane, and I don't like Adam Kane.

58:16.940 --> 58:19.780
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

58:19.780 --> 58:22.980
A tooth, now I've got plenty in my mouth.

58:22.980 --> 58:25.460
Ha, but no, it's a Rubik's Cube.

58:25.460 --> 58:27.140
And he hands you a business card.

58:27.140 --> 58:27.980
Let me read it.

58:27.980 --> 58:29.340
It says that he is the director

58:29.340 --> 58:31.700
of the Children's Museum of Mathematics.

58:31.700 --> 58:34.460
Yeah, that's not what his business card said last time.

58:35.300 --> 58:37.540
The Children's Museum of Mathematics

58:37.540 --> 58:42.540
is a location given to us by a patron at the $10 level.

58:43.420 --> 58:44.940
David from San Jose.

58:44.940 --> 58:47.540
Thanks, David, good job.

58:47.540 --> 58:48.380
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

58:48.380 --> 58:49.740
The Children's Museum of Mathematics

58:49.740 --> 58:51.580
is an underfunded museum,

58:51.580 --> 58:54.440
which aims to get kids excited about math.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.620
It's mostly puzzles and exhibits

58:56.620 --> 58:58.580
about how you can arrange shapes.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.260
Did he hand that card to me?

59:00.260 --> 59:02.660
Yes, have you not been?

59:02.660 --> 59:05.260
Randy, do you have a collection of all these cards?

59:05.260 --> 59:06.980
You got a bunch of different ones?

59:06.980 --> 59:08.100
Yeah, absolutely.

59:08.100 --> 59:09.940
And he reaches in a pocket

59:09.940 --> 59:12.220
and pulls out a bunch of business cards

59:12.220 --> 59:14.500
that all say Randy Angst,

59:14.500 --> 59:17.900
director of the Children's Museum of Mathematics.

59:17.900 --> 59:19.460
Randy, do you remember the last time

59:19.460 --> 59:21.180
we ran into each other?

59:21.180 --> 59:23.660
Keith Vigna, not one for mathematics.

59:23.660 --> 59:26.500
I believe you may have pulled me over

59:26.500 --> 59:28.220
because I didn't have my lights on

59:28.220 --> 59:29.820
about a month and a half ago.

59:29.820 --> 59:30.860
That's my bad.

59:30.860 --> 59:32.020
No, we're talking about the time

59:32.020 --> 59:33.740
you just shit all over your pants

59:33.740 --> 59:34.860
just a few days ago.

59:34.860 --> 59:35.860
A few days ago?

59:35.860 --> 59:37.760
My memory is hopefully not that bad,

59:37.760 --> 59:39.420
but the pants that I just shit in

59:39.420 --> 59:42.620
about 15 minutes ago are already in the washer.

59:42.620 --> 59:44.220
Randy, have you ever been director

59:44.220 --> 59:45.900
of the Contention Historical Society?

59:45.900 --> 59:48.740
I'm a member, but I didn't,

59:48.740 --> 59:50.100
did you ask if I started it?

59:50.100 --> 59:53.500
I don't wanna claim that I started it.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.940
No, no, I thought that's what your old card said

59:55.940 --> 59:56.980
is that you were director.

59:56.980 --> 59:58.100
My old card?

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.380
Yeah, we just ran into you a couple days ago.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.240
Back when we were fighting that robot man,

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.080
remember that?

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:03.900
It was a robot.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.740
You were staring at the legs.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.820
His upper half flew off the window.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.320
Randy Yanks is now slowly backing away

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.160
from the three of you.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.980
You were in chess games.

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:15.980
And he is going to, if you wouldn't mind,

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.980
I think I'm just going to,

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:22.540
and he's backing into his doorway of his house.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.900
Randy, Randy, now we don't mean you no harm.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.100
I'd really like to just shut this door.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.780
Randy, listen, for one second,

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.620
you're wearing sweatpants

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.920
instead of your three piece suit pants.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.940
That's cause you shit your pants.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.500
Yes, but that's not a crime.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.700
I know it's not a crime, but how would we know that

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.700
unless we had seen you shit your pants in the past?

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.340
Adds up, but I don't remember it.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.180
We know.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.680
Roll sanity, everybody.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.540
Is 91 good?

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.660
38, fail.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.060
I fail over my power.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.820
Yeah, I got bad news for Randy Yanks.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.020
I failed over my power.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.860
The door isn't quite closed yet.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.640
Do we just take one or a D something?

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.540
No, just one.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.640
Well, fellers, it seems like this town is fucked

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.140
and we might as well just bail on this reality.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:15.980
Later.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.400
That's one way we can do this.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.680
I don't know if it'll be satisfying.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.060
You know, people say we don't get a lot

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.700
of satisfying conclusions to these plot points,

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:30.380
but Luke wrapped up that three single dollar things so fast.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.900
All in one, baby.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.880
Yeah, that plot point you introduced this episode.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.720
Fucking nailed it.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.300
It was the last episode, I think.

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.460
It was tonight.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.060
Earlier this evening.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:46.060
As all of you realize, Randy Yanks ain't Randy Yanks.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.420
Is Randy Yanks?

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.420
He's not our Randy Yanks.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.620
Exactly, but maybe somebody's Randy Yanks

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.340
and Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.540
both roll over their power, lose one sanity,

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.660
and then Clark goes first.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.700
Clark is rushing the door

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.900
and Joe is hoping that Randy closed it first,

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.720
but he's rushing the front door to attack Randy.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.980
Yeah, let's just do a quick roll.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.140
Okay, what kind of roll?

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:09.980
Dexterity.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.140
The one roll I make tonight.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.620
It's a 52 on a 60.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.460
Get him.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.980
89.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.820
Oh yeah.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.420
Oh, you're busting in there.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.740
I barrel in the door so hard

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.600
that it knocks him back and onto the ground.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.020
And I'm doing like I did to Keith.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.860
Oh, no.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.100
Just moments before,

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.500
and I'm throttling him into the ground,

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.020
saying, you're not a children's museum of mathematics guy.

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:46.900
You're a historical society guy.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.740
Keith Vigna.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.180
I see that and I start looking around

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.300
and I see the two guys on the ground

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:54.860
and Jimmy in the back,

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.700
and I'm like, this is a trap.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.580
Somebody's coming and I get my gun out

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.140
and I just shoot.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.500
I shoot at Terrence.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.780
Holy shit.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.500
Luca and Jimmy.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.780
Holy shit.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.700
Should I roll firearms?

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.460
No, I'm gonna roll.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.180
Just like a 50-50 luck, basically.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.620
If you're just like unloading a clip

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.740
around like three people.

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.540
Yeah, then I'll roll luck for each of them.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.580
It won't be 50-50.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.300
That'd be insane.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.900
It'll be like a 25% chance that it hits any one of them.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.060
22.

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:32.900
So...

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.460
Somebody's getting dinged.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.700
That's the one we wanna kill.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:41.540
Yep, so D6, we'll do a one and a two is Jimmy Sanders,

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.980
a three and a four is Fade,

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.180
and a five and a six is Terrence.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.180
Is that a five?

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.060
It's a three.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.900
Yep.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.740
Jimmy.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.580
No, that's Fade.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.420
Fade.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.260
Three's Fade.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.340
You like fire a couple shots towards Jimmy Sanders

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.460
and then a couple shots towards Terrence,

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:03.260
who's like right next to you, like on the ground.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.700
As you're looking at Terrence,

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.380
you just like hold it up and fire over it, Fade,

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.740
and go ahead and roll a D10.

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.580
Nine.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.620
Nine?

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.820
Nine.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:15.740
Oh boy.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.340
Clark Marshall, Clark Marshall, Clark Marshall,

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.180
Clark Marshall here.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.260
Clark Bishop rushes into the house of Randy Anks,

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:25.620
shoving the door backwards,

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.460
knocking Randy Anks on his back.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.940
Keith Vigna begins unloading his clip into the area,

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:32.700
freaking out, his eyes are wide.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.460
Johnny, you can see it and he's panicking.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.820
And as he's panicking, you can't even tell

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.540
where he's aiming this gun.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.900
And then all of a sudden you just see like

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.980
the fucking Zapruder film.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.820
Luca, Fade, Fajevic's head,

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:53.820
and the garage is a Kai Twombly painting immediately.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.940
Just abstract art on the garage door of Randy Anks

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:03.460
as the shoulders slump off to the right

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:07.140
with the momentum of this gunshot.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:12.140
And the blood now starts a second path down the driveway,

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.100
but the second one is moving much, much quicker

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.740
and it is much wider and thicker

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:22.180
with the blood of Luca, Fade, Fajevic

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.180
as he dies errant bullet from an insane Keith Vigna

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.820
who turns to you.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.300
And I need John Lee Pettymore, Thomas, sorry,

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.300
and Joe to take your headphones off.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.300
As Keith Vigna turns to John Lee Pettymore the third,

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:45.740
you see that this black viscous ooze is pouring

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.940
out of his nose and it is dripping from his mouth

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:53.660
and it is running down his cheeks from his eyes

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.700
and from his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.060
From his ears, it is going underneath his shirt.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.260
I look back over at him and I point my gun at him

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.620
and I say, get back in the water.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.140
At me?

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.100
Yeah.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.740
Aw, all right, and he does so.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:24.620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.980
Oh, all right.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.580
And me, all right.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:31.620
Holy shit.

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:53.740
Am I the only one trying to pull over?

01:06:55.620 --> 01:07:00.620
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
