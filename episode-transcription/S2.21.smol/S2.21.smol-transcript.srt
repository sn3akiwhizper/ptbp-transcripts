1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, well, well.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello all my beautiful babies.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,600
It's your spectral guardian, Wolf the Dog,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,840
the DJ at the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,120
Let's not dilly-dally and go ahead and jump

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,240
into everyone's favorite part of the show.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,520
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Sam Witch,

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,720
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,080
A thing you should do, lest your blessed internet guests

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,400
guess that your zest for ingesting my jests

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,680
has been wrested from your chest.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,480
But I digress.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,560
Sam Witch writes,

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,000
Wolf the Dog, I have followed every instruction

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,520
you've given to the letterer every week,

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,400
telling those that would be to my left and to my right

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,960
to keep the radio dial tuned to 694.2 PTBP,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,960
despite there being none other than me

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,480
in this near featureless void.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,080
You, Wolf the Dog, are the only exception

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,440
to the otherwise unending monotony.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,360
Thus to you I plead, please, Wolf the Dog,

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,280
be my lifeline back to the extensive library

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,080
that led me here with its yellowed pages

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,520
and please be quiet signs.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,480
No, that's okay, Sam Witch.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,240
I don't think I have time to do

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,040
whatever it is you just asked me to do,

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,320
but have fun whenever and wherever you are.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,200
Ta-ta for now.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,720
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,240
come on, say it with me in your brain space.

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,840
Tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,800
and tag pretending to be people on Facebook

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
or write up a five star review

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,160
on the podcast app of your choice

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,680
and make sure the proof comes across my desk.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,080
Oh, and by the way, I heard what y'all did.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,680
I heard y'all raised almost 800 bucks

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,520
and I heard those nasty boys

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,880
from pretending to be people rounded up, matched it

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,680
and sent a total of $1,600

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,880
to the crisis cold weather shelter

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,880
in their hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,000
Damn y'all, what a good job y'all did.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,640
My producer's eye caverns have filled with salty water

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,800
because of the good y'all helped us spread

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
and no matter what kind of water fills your holes,

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,600
there's always the news.

50
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,840
Last time, Cal reached out to his contact

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,680
in the city PD, Chief McMillan,

52
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,000
to find out more information about the un-uniformed gobs

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that stole footage from Vivica at the Cannes station.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The two officers showed up in CPD cruiser number 836

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,080
and Chief Mac used cop net to identify them

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,320
as officer Richard Riley and officer Wilson Wiley.

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,160
Tithe Rayland texted his employee and nephew,

58
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Julius Summers and asked him to come back

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,480
to the Cannes station soon to meet in Tithe's office

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
and to bring Beck and Cal.

61
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,120
After a quick stop at Riley and Wiley's local drinking hole,

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,240
which is of course called W-A-R-E-R-We,

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,640
we're at Bucky's Kids Bar, duh,

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,460
the Cannes crew was able to bribe the night manager

65
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,120
for Riley and Wiley's addresses.

66
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,960
But at that same moment, Tithe texted again,

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,440
more impatient this time,

68
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,240
requesting the team's presence in his office.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,520
Speaking of presence, here's a true gift,

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,240
a brand new tune, just for you my favorite listener,

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,360
my widdle baby.

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,500
Shh, don't tell anyone else now,

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,500
it's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

74
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,140
And it's all my fault

75
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,140
Cause my life is great

76
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,140
And it's all mine

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Cause my life is great

78
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,500
And it's all my fault

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
And it's all my fault

80
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,420
Hey Luke, who was your favorite teacher?

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,420
My favorite teacher, probably Jesus.

82
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,860
Joe, write that down.

83
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,740
Jesus?

84
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,620
My first pet named after my favorite teacher.

85
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,780
Jesus, Jesus, okay.

86
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,020
The street you grew up on?

87
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Uh, oh crap, I was trying to think of like a-

88
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,620
Golgotha, Jesus.

89
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,420
I don't know enough about the Bible to have made a joke.

90
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,500
That's the hill that he was crucified on.

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,940
That's the hill he died on.

92
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,220
And he stayed dead.

93
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,740
Dude, I was laughing the other day.

94
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Actually, there's some debate on that last point.

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,300
I saw somebody be like, I saw somebody online be like,

96
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,460
I was online, somebody was like,

97
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,540
so wait, he came back from the dead,

98
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,340
so he didn't die for our sins,

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,780
he like took a weekend off for our sins.

100
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,780
I'm not really familiar with the text, but he's like-

101
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,660
He died, he went to hell.

102
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,980
I don't ask me why he went to hell.

103
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,820
He stole the gates.

104
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,700
No, not the gates, that would be too much.

105
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,380
He stole the keys to the gates of hell.

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,780
It would be too much for him to carry.

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
Far too much.

108
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,900
Luke, this doesn't sound made up, hear him out.

109
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,660
So he goes to hell.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,060
It does sound like a set up for a joke.

111
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,660
Okay, so Jesus dies, he goes to hell.

112
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,700
He steals the keys, not the gates.

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,340
It sounds like a good-ass comic book.

114
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,460
I get why all those people tried to turn the Bible

115
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,280
into a comic.

116
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,620
Yeah, from hell.

117
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,700
Yeah, Alan Moore's adaptation.

118
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,460
I want that-

119
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,580
Wait, so did Jesus really go to hell?

120
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,020
There are many eye witnesses to-

121
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,140
There are many sex knights of Christianity

122
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,340
who do believe that Jesus went to hell and stole the keys.

123
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,380
And so they just made that up and they say it

124
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,220
and that's what they believe.

125
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,540
So you worship a thief?

126
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,660
Wow.

127
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,260
I believe they say multiple times that Jesus will come back

128
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,940
like a thief in the night for his followers.

129
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,580
I want that shirt that says,

130
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,020
if Jesus comes back, we'll kill him again.

131
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,220
I want Jesus to come on my back like a thief in the night.

132
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,700
Is this an ad for Roman?

133
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,620
Did I show you guys the shirt that I bought

134
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,320
based on an Instagram ad?

135
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,700
Yes, you did.

136
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,540
I cannot wait to get that one.

137
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,740
Do you want to tell people what it is?

138
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,160
It's like a weird green monster guy on the phone

139
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,500
kind of like kicking back.

140
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,460
And it says, if you don't like my attitude,

141
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,980
call 1-800-EAT-SHIT.

142
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,740
Were you gonna wear that to the Christmas

143
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,780
you can't go to?

144
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,380
I was hoping that I could.

145
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,180
Now I'll just have to wear it to a client meeting.

146
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,780
No, just have to wear it, yeah.

147
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,540
On the family Zoom call.

148
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,580
No, it's not Christmas time.

149
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,340
It's January, mid January.

150
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,320
How's sober January going for you guys?

151
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
What's that?

152
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,660
It's December, but I already stopped mine.

153
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,020
I don't decide what my new year's resolution

154
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,380
is gonna be until, you know, usually January 3rd, so.

155
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,580
Mine's jerk off every day.

156
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,300
How are you doing this year?

157
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,500
In 2022.

158
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,260
It's the same one every year.

159
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,220
Yeah, you're down six days from 365,

160
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,980
so we're rocking 359.

161
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,680
How many times have you KO'd?

162
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,460
Wait, say the first part again.

163
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,740
Well, there's probably been around 358, 359 days this year.

164
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,340
I would say maybe not every day,

165
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,280
but at least enough to average one a day.

166
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,900
Couple Tuesdays pulling some heavy weight there.

167
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah, a couple Threesdays and Foursdays.

168
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,620
Thomas, how many times a day do you jerk off?

169
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,540
Average.

170
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,500
Average.

171
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
Or weird.

172
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,300
Yeah, at least.

173
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm gonna say my-

174
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,940
No, no, no, say the number that makes you feel weird

175
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,860
in a day.

176
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,420
I haven't found that number yet.

177
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm proud of each and every one of them.

178
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
No, no, no, by weird I mean lightheaded.

179
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,740
The limit does not exist.

180
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,100
Yeah.

181
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,620
One of my favorite Christmas movies.

182
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,660
Oh my goodness.

183
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,500
Die hard.

184
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,620
Have you guys watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas movie?

185
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,460
I did, yes.

186
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,540
Was it bad?

187
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,380
Top notch.

188
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,460
Like recommend or like it's fine that you watched it?

189
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,180
On my belt.

190
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,020
On my belt?

191
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,420
Yeah, I had to notch it all the way up.

192
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Real tight.

193
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,940
Did you really watch it?

194
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah, I did watch it.

195
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,180
It was on at my house.

196
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,980
I didn't put it on.

197
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,060
Probably your dumb wife.

198
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,180
My dumb, I couldn't even say it.

199
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,220
Taylor, my extremely intelligent and compassionate wife.

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,320
Who does dumb shit?

201
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,800
I think it was either her or Lindsay,

202
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,460
another one of our guests here at Pretending to be People.

203
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,700
Another one of my wives.

204
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,800
They put it on when we were hanging out

205
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,760
and then I think they hung out

206
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
and I watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas film.

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,440
Is it like, I've been told it's like Hallmark vibes.

208
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
It very much is a Hallmark movie.

209
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,160
It's just on Netflix, yeah.

210
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,280
She bonks her head, forgets who she is.

211
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,800
The guy that she falls in love with

212
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,660
is technically taking advantage of her

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,820
because she knows how much money she's worth.

214
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,200
When you say technically,

215
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,040
do you mean he still actually really loves her?

216
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Oh, defo.

217
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,700
I saw one on Peacock called Love on Rye

218
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,900
and this Jewish matchmaker sets these two people up

219
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,660
and then the drama is that they find out

220
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,620
that they operate competing delis.

221
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,300
And that is not made up.

222
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,920
Wait, is this a non-fiction or fiction?

223
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
TBD.

224
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,540
I think he's asking is it reality or?

225
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,780
That is what I was asking.

226
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,620
And that's what I was answering.

227
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
That's historical fiction is what Luke means.

228
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,180
Based on a true story probably.

229
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,900
Yeah, Argo style.

230
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Sounds like it's based on You've Got Mail.

231
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,980
It's called Hanukkah on Rye.

232
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
What did you say it was?

233
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,860
Love on Rye?

234
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,620
Yeah, I was wondering if that was like a play on words

235
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,580
for something.

236
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,420
Well.

237
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,900
Let's dive into this motherfucker.

238
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,720
Let's do it.

239
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,560
Dive on in.

240
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,660
Let's do a bit of a dive in then.

241
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,500
Dive.

242
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,220
Let's do a dive into the pool.

243
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,900
Hey, remember what we said earlier about Scottish accents.

244
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, I said I was gonna do a dive into the pool.

245
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,740
Yeah, there you go.

246
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,540
As long as you're respectful.

247
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,980
It's deeper than four feet gonna do.

248
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,260
What's four feet?

249
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,180
Don't you mean a meter and a half?

250
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,940
Oh, this pool is about a fortnight deep.

251
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,660
Bet I can dive in here.

252
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Dive on in.

253
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,100
You guys were on our way to talk to one of the

254
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,660
Richard or Wylie?

255
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,820
Or say their names.

256
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,460
Richard Wylie and William Wylie.

257
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,500
Wilson Wylie.

258
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,660
Nice.

259
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,380
Wilson or Richard and we've got a date with Uncle Tife.

260
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,700
You do have a date with Uncle Tife.

261
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,200
You've been out and about today going from place to place.

262
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,320
I believe you started over at Vivica's apartment,

263
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,860
headed on back to the can station,

264
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,940
which then led you out to a bar.

265
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,080
What was the bar called?

266
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,700
There was a little stop off there in between those

267
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,500
down at the park to visit an old friend of Cal's.

268
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,900
That's right.

269
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,860
An eloquent, well-spoken gentleman.

270
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,100
An articulate gentleman.

271
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,820
And he gave you the names of the...

272
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
He gave the names.

273
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
He gave us the names and he also said that

274
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,660
15 to 25% of his force were not cops, but gops.

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,460
Cops on the Godel payroll.

276
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,760
Which led us to, where are we?

277
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,460
Spelled W-A-R-E in the dare font.

278
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,740
We're at Bucky Kid's bar.

279
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,620
Duh.

280
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,580
Where we spoke to Bucky Kid's kid.

281
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,420
That's right.

282
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,300
Who pointed us to Lulu, the night manager.

283
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,140
L-E-A-U-X.

284
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,980
Lolo.

285
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,800
L-E-A-X.

286
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,640
Is it Lolo?

287
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,700
It's Lolo.

288
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,820
Pardon me.

289
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,220
He pointed us towards Lolo, the night manager

290
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,900
of where are we, we're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh.

291
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,600
Which started out, no one liked that.

292
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,240
And I think it grew on us a little bit.

293
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm fine with it, as long as you're the one

294
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,280
who remembers how to say it.

295
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,480
It's like Wawa KBD, right?

296
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,600
Or B-K-B.

297
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Wawa book-ba.

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,580
I don't know any of the stuff you just said.

299
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,420
Where are we?

300
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,280
We're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh.

301
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,720
Wawa book-ba-da is what they call it for short.

302
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,820
Easily remembered.

303
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,040
Anyway, then we called Lolo.

304
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,400
He hooked us up with a couple addresses.

305
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,500
After Cal.

306
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,600
Called him.

307
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,440
And.

308
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,540
Tricked him.

309
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,380
And.

310
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,680
Didn't trick him so much.

311
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,520
Fin modem?

312
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Fin modem.

313
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,980
Yes, sometimes you must grease the palms of truth.

314
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,760
And then I think we took off towards one of the addresses.

315
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,080
We benevolently said whichever's close to us,

316
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,600
so you can give us the character you want us to meet first.

317
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,960
And on the way there, Tife texted Julius,

318
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,880
said, hey, get here soon,

319
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,040
but we got a date for 45 minutes.

320
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,840
Yeah, and what are we supposed to meet Tife about?

321
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,120
I don't think we know, I think he just.

322
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,240
He just said he wants to talk to us.

323
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,480
Yeah, and I mean, you went into the office for a little bit.

324
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,520
You didn't talk to Tife.

325
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,680
He hasn't seen you around.

326
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,120
It's been a minute since you've seen Tife,

327
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,400
so he's probably just curious.

328
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,600
Didn't we tell him, though, that we were trying,

329
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
that we didn't have the footage

330
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
and we were trying to get the footage back?

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,680
He at least knows what we're out and about doing, I think.

332
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,400
Zach said he's probably just curious,

333
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,840
so it's.

334
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,280
I told him I was working out,

335
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,800
that's why I couldn't meet with him then.

336
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,640
It's like, I gotta see my cousin's hot gym bod.

337
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,520
I don't know if we did, did we tell him about the footage?

338
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,360
I don't know if we did.

339
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,720
I feel like we did, I feel like we told him

340
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,640
that that's why we didn't wanna meet him right away,

341
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,160
is that we were trying to get it back.

342
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
Didn't we say that to him?

343
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,680
I told him I was working out.

344
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,760
You knew that you didn't trust him.

345
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I don't think we told him.

346
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay, I thought we did, but it doesn't matter either way.

347
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,560
He'll ask us where it is if we get there.

348
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,840
In that moment, two possible realities were created.

349
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
So we'll be playing two different stories

350
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
from here on out coming out

351
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,520
on still the biweekly schedule.

352
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,480
It might get a little wild.

353
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,240
And who knows, maybe we'll go back and forward in time.

354
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
Oh, god.

355
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh, timey-wimey?

356
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Oh, timey-wimey.

357
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,160
If you're gonna spend any amount of time

358
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
at Richard Riley or Wilson Wiley's home,

359
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,080
you're not going to be able to visit there

360
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,360
and make it back to the can station

361
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,000
in time for the meeting with Tyfe.

362
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,840
So you have a choice at this point.

363
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,000
You can either show up early for the meeting

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,320
or you can go to one of these homes

365
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,640
and then show up late to the meeting.

366
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,480
What was the urgency

367
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,200
in getting to these places right now?

368
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,240
To get our footage back.

369
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,320
Yeah, we were trying not to show up empty-handed at least.

370
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,800
Yeah, have the footage when we go to work.

371
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,120
I think we were pretty heavily headed in the direction

372
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,560
of talking to one of them before we go to the meeting.

373
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah, I think so too.

374
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,600
I just don't know.

375
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,480
Joe doesn't know what we're gonna do

376
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,600
when we get to one of these places.

377
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,480
Looking at these names,

378
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,160
I wonder if he had a voice plan for Richard Riley

379
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,680
and then he's just gonna do it again

380
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,440
with like a lisp for Wilson Wiley.

381
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,240
It seems like his style.

382
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,680
Don't call me out like that.

383
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,940
Guys, we're supposed to meet with Tyfe in 45 minutes,

384
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,640
but I think I can hold him off if we're a little late.

385
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Let's go to Wilson Wiley's.

386
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,680
Brrrrrr.

387
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,520
Arghhh.

388
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

389
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,020
Beep beep.

390
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,840
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

391
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,740
Watch you crazy motherfucker.

392
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,820
Ahhh-ooh-ha.

393
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,400
You are in the downtown area.

394
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,400
The apartment for Wilson Wiley is in a nice tall...

395
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,360
Yeah, do you like that?

396
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,800
What's this neighborhood called?

397
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,280
Oh, the downtown area.

398
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,640
Hahaha.

399
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,360
It's a hot July day, midday, rolling into downtown,

400
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,520
skyscrapers towering on either side of you.

401
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,520
You continue in Cal Colorado's beautiful Mercedes C-Class

402
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
with a, what was it?

403
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,820
A red siren on top with Bluetooth speakers,

404
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,600
and Julius is in the back watching Cloud Atlas.

405
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,440
Hahahaha.

406
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,160
If he had his earbuds out, he would hear Cal Colorado

407
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,240
talking loudly over the radio and saying,

408
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,200
do you like this Beck?

409
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,080
It's the Blues Brothers soundtrack.

410
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,120
Yeah, man, it's...

411
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,200
Well, Blues Brothers 2000.

412
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say it's a classic,

413
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,480
and that's, I mean, it's got its things too.

414
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,320
Yeah.

415
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,140
Yeah.

416
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,980
No, that's a good one, yeah.

417
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,040
I like it.

418
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,200
It's good, yeah.

419
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,360
Is Rubber Biscuit on that one?

420
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
Oh, no, that's on the first one.

421
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,900
Oh, yeah, okay.

422
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,900
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,680
I mean, they do a really, really energetic cover

424
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,040
of funky Nassau.

425
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
All right, yeah.

426
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
I can get into it.

427
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
That's kind of at the end, though,

428
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
where it's, I don't think we'll get to it on this trip.

429
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

430
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,080
You should really experience it in order.

431
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,160
Did we start at one?

432
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

433
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,200
Or is this where you left off last time you were in here?

434
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
We're on two.

435
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,960
Listen, after we finish, we'll watch the movie together.

436
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,860
No, I've seen it.

437
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,280
Wait, hook?

438
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,100
Hook.

439
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,940
Hahahaha.

440
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,960
Julius pauses the movie and takes his earbuds out,

441
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,040
and it's kind of like looking very inspired.

442
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,000
What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

443
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,400
And then they pull up to Wylie's house.

444
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,160
Which is an apartment.

445
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,860
Oh, beautiful da, downtown area,

446
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,920
but that's what they're calling it.

447
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,040
I thought that park got cut.

448
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
Yeah, probably did.

449
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,240
So you guys pull into a underground parking lot

450
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,240
for an apartment building in the downtown area?

451
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,100
Da.

452
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,920
Da da.

453
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,680
And it's like really nice.

454
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,960
This is suspiciously nice for a cop.

455
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,680
I think we're dealing with a cop here.

456
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,520
Indeed.

457
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,480
There's plenty of visitor parking

458
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,240
and an elevator that leads you up into the building.

459
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,560
His apartment's on the eighth floor.

460
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,240
Just want to point out that we made our way downtown.

461
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
Hahahaha.

462
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Making our way to the downtown area.

463
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,680
Driving fast.

464
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Looking for Wilson Wylie.

465
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,520
And now I'm in the dock.

466
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,240
We've got Cloud Atlas.

467
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
Da na na na na na na na na.

468
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,680
On the DVD.

469
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,560
Da na na na na na na na.

470
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Funky Nassau.

471
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
And Tom Hanks.

472
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
Funky Nassau.

473
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,900
And Oprah.

474
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,740
Was she in that?

475
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,800
She's thinking of the color purple.

476
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,640
Dammit.

477
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,040
What do you think Cloud Atlas is?

478
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
Hahahaha.

479
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,960
Tell me right now.

480
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,600
First thoughts.

481
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,920
I'm picturing looks like Lake Tahoe.

482
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,760
Nailed it.

483
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,520
Unfortunately not.

484
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,960
That's a really good guess.

485
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,280
That's a good stab in the dark for any particular,

486
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,320
like I don't know what that is,

487
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,840
but that's not Cloud Atlas.

488
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,880
About a map maker who lives in...

489
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,480
That's closer.

490
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,040
Okay, a map maker?

491
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,560
No, but like a...

492
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,440
So you guys get out of the C class

493
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
and head over to the elevator.

494
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,720
There's a doorman who's actually stationed down

495
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,560
in the parking area and he greets you

496
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,500
and he's just like...

497
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,340
Eighth floor?

498
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,160
Eighth floor.

499
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,120
Yeah, of course.

500
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
And he clicks the up button on the elevator.

501
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,800
Who are you going to visit?

502
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,280
Oh, just an old friend.

503
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,340
What is your name, sir?

504
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,240
Dave.

505
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,220
Dave, I'm Cal Colorado.

506
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,560
City Action News.

507
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,320
Whoa, that's right.

508
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
I knew you looked familiar.

509
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,400
How are you doing today, Dave?

510
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,260
Wow, better now, sir.

511
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,720
Got any news for me?

512
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,240
Well, well, we might.

513
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,520
Let me just say we might.

514
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,360
Hm hm hm hm hm hm.

515
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,760
But that's not what we're doing here today.

516
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,840
Again, this is just an old family friend

517
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,800
we're checking up on.

518
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
Well, of course, you all have a lovely day.

519
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,700
You too, Dave.

520
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,760
I stay waving until I'm sure the elevator doors have closed

521
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,640
and he's gone down.

522
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,320
The elevator doors have closed.

523
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,160
You are going up.

524
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,920
He has stayed in the same spot.

525
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,960
Oh, I thought he was on the elevator with us.

526
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,120
He decided not to ride.

527
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
No, he was on the outside of the elevator.

528
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,200
He's in the...

529
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,680
I thought he was in it with us also.

530
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
Oh, then I guess he's in the elevator.

531
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Eighth floor, huh?

532
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,560
Yeah, I thought we...

533
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
I'm not so much an elevator attendant

534
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,920
as a parking garage kind of guy.

535
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
There's a way to make this work in the edit

536
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,080
without us saying anything else.

537
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,920
Hahaha.

538
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,600
As the doors open to the eighth floor,

539
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,080
you see a beautiful carpet.

540
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,980
It's got scenes of the jungle on it.

541
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,280
So there's lots of different plant life

542
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,120
and animals kind of drawn into it.

543
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,760
And the scene's kind of carpet

544
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
like at the Springfield airport.

545
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm thinking Zach just watched the intro

546
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,120
to season one of White Lotus.

547
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I just watched season one of White Lotus last year.

548
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,980
It was really good.

549
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,040
Was there animals?

550
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,280
I don't remember.

551
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,560
Yeah, the intro is just images

552
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,120
of everything Zach just described.

553
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,960
Okay, so it's that.

554
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
It's the White Lotus season one intro.

555
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,680
It was the carpet that you used for that intro.

556
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

557
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,680
Well, I was just thinking about it.

558
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,520
Hahaha.

559
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,280
And there's...

560
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,680
You can support the podcast on Patreon

561
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,660
if you want more content like this.

562
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,100
There's sconces on the walls

563
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,980
in between each of these doors

564
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,500
that are considerably far apart.

565
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,780
So like White Lotus 2.

566
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,260
The sequel.

567
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,500
The sconce is in.

568
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,380
Okay guys, we need to find apartment 80085.

569
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,180
I bet it's going to be 836.

570
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,060
Well, let's check the text message and see.

571
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,340
When you go to the text, guess what it is?

572
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,180
836.

573
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,380
It's boobs.

574
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,220
It's boobs.

575
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,580
Yeah, it's apartment 836.

576
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,100
What are we going to say to him?

577
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,020
Cal bangs on the door.

578
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,820
Cal Colorado, give me back my footage you son of a bitch.

579
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,660
Hello?

580
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,460
Oh fuck.

581
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,060
Julius's legs tense, ready for action.

582
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,180
On the other side of the door, you hear a small voice.

583
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,060
Hello, this is a nice newsman.

584
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,900
Hello.

585
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,380
Is your daddy here?

586
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,220
No.

587
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,280
Perfect, open up.

588
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,220
Cal like winces, but doesn't correct him.

589
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,060
Doesn't like.

590
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,940
Roll persuade.

591
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,300
30 pass on a 60.

592
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,980
This little girl succeeded as well

593
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,300
with a higher roll, the 47.

594
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,180
She says, I'm not supposed to let in any strangers.

595
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,860
Oh, of course not.

596
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
But I'm no stranger.

597
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,780
I'm Cal Colorado from the news.

598
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,100
You've probably seen me.

599
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Oh man, this candy bar is super good.

600
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,740
I wish I had somebody to share it with.

601
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,580
Oh my God.

602
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,580
You sound like you've done this before.

603
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,740
You're gonna have to learn the enemy, you know?

604
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,820
Any horrible thoughts from Becker now?

605
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,820
No, he's just filming.

606
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,040
Such as horrible deeds.

607
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,180
Cal, if you wanna go ahead and roll.

608
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,620
Yeah, I'll roll.

609
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,180
That's a 67 on an 80.

610
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,840
Yeah, she passed as well, but only with a 30.

611
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,500
Cal Colorado from a TV?

612
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,740
That's right, I'm from your TV, sweetie.

613
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,580
Wow.

614
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,420
And the door unlocks and then the door slowly opens

615
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,860
and you see just the most adorable little six year old

616
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,060
on the other side staring up at you.

617
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,500
Cal turns back to you guys

618
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,220
and like gives you a very like pained look

619
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,860
and then turns back to her with a huge smile

620
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,940
and he's like, hi, I'm so glad to see you.

621
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,300
I've always wanted to meet you.

622
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,220
Wow, it's Mr. Cal Colorado who's on my TV

623
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,060
in front of me at the door.

624
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,780
Come in and look at my toys.

625
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,220
I would love to see your toys, but first I need to know.

626
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,140
This one's a pony and her name is Sandal.

627
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,100
Sandal, I like Sandal very much.

628
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,940
Me too.

629
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,260
What's this one called?

630
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,060
Oh, this one's Tressa.

631
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,500
Tressa, does Tressa know

632
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,580
where your daddy keeps his work things?

633
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,180
She like makes the horse nay.

634
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,740
The work things, I only know about where those are

635
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,500
if you can feed me.

636
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,420
Oh, it seems that Tressa is hungry.

637
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,380
Pass the candy bar over Julius.

638
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,860
Julius was lying.

639
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,420
You've got a six year old holding up a little

640
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,260
like miniature horse at you.

641
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,380
Julius feed the horse.

642
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,300
Beck, check your pockets.

643
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,780
Beck definitely has candy bars in his pockets.

644
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,100
He pulls one out.

645
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,540
Here's one for, was it Sandal or Tressa

646
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,380
that was so hungry?

647
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
Tressa, Tressa.

648
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,060
Here you go Tressa.

649
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,380
And I kind of am shoving the candy bar

650
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,820
against the horse's mouth.

651
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,940
Oh, it looks like she likes that.

652
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,340
It's an oat candy bar.

653
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,740
Someone roll like 50, 50 up and down.

654
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,260
Who's leaving a six year old home alone?

655
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,460
45.

656
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,740
That's good.

657
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,580
That's good.

658
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,700
These neglectful parents.

659
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,780
You think that you hear a sound coming from

660
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,220
like the bathroom or something, but.

661
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,300
Then a cat hops out.

662
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,140
Nice.

663
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,740
Oh, Tressa's so hungry.

664
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,140
Julius, while this is happening,

665
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,380
is gonna do a quick once over of the.

666
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,500
Yeah, everybody, yeah.

667
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,340
Yeah.

668
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
Actually nods off.

669
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,180
Roll search.

670
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,380
31 on a 70.

671
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
Okay, hit me with what you're looking for.

672
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,620
Our footage, you son of a bitch.

673
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,020
Yeah, any sort of tech looking stuff

674
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,660
or anything that would, or like a safe or something.

675
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,780
Yeah, Cal passes too.

676
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,380
He's like, and tell me this one's name.

677
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,420
But he's like looking behind her shoulder

678
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,900
like all over the room.

679
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,180
This one's Dango.

680
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,020
Dango.

681
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,860
Dango.

682
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,380
How'd you come up with that name?

683
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,220
I said it.

684
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,020
What a ham.

685
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,100
You would do very well on the news, young lady.

686
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,820
She immediately runs away

687
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,220
and is digging through toys.

688
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,700
Hey, remember Tressa was gonna show us

689
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,860
where your daddy keeps his work banks?

690
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,580
This one's a ham pulls out a pig.

691
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,540
Oh, oh, smashing.

692
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,980
That's what you do with a pig bank.

693
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,460
Did Julius find anything?

694
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,500
Yes, you found a safe.

695
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,700
Big, small.

696
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,780
Yes, it is a medium sized safe.

697
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,260
It's a Goldilocks safe.

698
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,260
It is in the back bedroom is the master bedroom closet.

699
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,780
There is a average size safe back there.

700
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,260
Julius is gonna try 88, five.

701
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,820
It does not work.

702
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,780
Julius, what if you tried eight, three, six?

703
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,220
He tries eight, three, six.

704
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,180
Go ahead and roll luck.

705
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,980
If you create, I'll give it to you.

706
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,820
Oh my God though.

707
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,980
It was a 23.

708
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,820
Yeah.

709
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,860
Like the number movie.

710
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,100
Like the number movie.

711
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,220
Does Julius start seeing numbers?

712
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,060
Wait, yeah, actually.

713
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,100
Just like the time I crashed my Scion TC.

714
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,500
Why are you trying eight, three, six?

715
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,660
There's just like a subliminal vibe in here.

716
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,500
Yeah.

717
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,340
Like it just kind of feels like.

718
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,180
God told them to.

719
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,100
Because it's the apartment number.

720
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,920
That's a good reason.

721
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,760
That's fine.

722
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,500
But it was boobs was the apartment number, right?

723
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,540
Oh, right, right, try boobs.

724
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,780
I did already, it didn't work.

725
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,500
You also see a spot on the desk where there was a laptop,

726
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
but there is currently not a laptop

727
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,460
and it seems like the charger is pulled up in that spot

728
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,100
and there's like a clip for it

729
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,700
and the mouse and mouse pad are there,

730
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,940
but there's no laptop sitting in the empty spot on the desk.

731
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,460
What was the kid's name?

732
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,300
What?

733
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,120
You know what?

734
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,460
You've told us your horsey's names.

735
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,300
Yeah.

736
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,120
And the pig's name.

737
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,960
What is your name?

738
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Oh, my name?

739
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,580
Way-chill.

740
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,160
Well, Way-chill.

741
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,420
No, it's Way-chill.

742
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,780
Oh, Rachel.

743
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,620
That's right.

744
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,440
I have a cousin named Rachel.

745
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,540
She's smart like you.

746
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,380
She smiles.

747
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,900
Do you get left alone here very often?

748
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,720
No.

749
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,560
No?

750
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,460
How long ago did your parents step out?

751
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,260
She's just like playing with toys

752
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,140
and she's like, mom went down to go get some groceries

753
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,340
to finish up the meal and you look over

754
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,540
and there's like some things have been pulled out

755
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,900
of the fridge and like no chopping has started,

756
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,820
but it seems like meal prep is about to begin.

757
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,380
Oh, I bet that looks like a good lunch.

758
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,180
I think you probably have a good mom

759
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,540
who feeds you good nutritious food.

760
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,400
I'm sure your dad cares about that too.

761
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,620
What time would you say he left for work?

762
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,900
Oh, I don't see my daddy very much.

763
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,740
Oh.

764
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,060
Julius pops his head out.

765
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,500
Had a dad like that too.

766
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,740
Oh, yeah.

767
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,140
Remind me again when your birthday is.

768
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,700
Oh, my birthday?

769
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,540
Uh-huh.

770
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,660
August 3rd?

771
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,780
Of what year?

772
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,600
What?

773
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,440
How old are you?

774
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,460
The year you were born.

775
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,820
I'm this many.

776
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,780
Six, Julius.

777
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,940
Julius deducts six from the year that it is currently.

778
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,060
It's 2022.

779
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,220
He tries, yeah, I'm not doing that math.

780
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,220
It's like 1980, what am I, Stephen Hawking?

781
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Julius tries eight, three, you said six years old?

782
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,700
We already did eight, three, six, we already.

783
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,620
Well, not, yeah, but.

784
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,460
This time I did it because August 3rd

785
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,900
and she's six years old.

786
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,340
Yeah, eight.

787
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,860
Well, not eight, three, six, but eight, three, six.

788
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,700
16.

789
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,520
Eight, three, 16.

790
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,360
Roll luck again.

791
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,900
90 is good, right?

792
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,020
I liked them.

793
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,700
Julius is gonna kick the safe.

794
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
What was that?

795
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,360
Ow.

796
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,540
Oh, that's my friend Julius.

797
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,580
He's very clumsy.

798
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,140
Are any of these animals clumsy?

799
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,260
Oh, yeah.

800
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,320
Twain?

801
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,160
Twain.

802
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,220
Twain is very clumsy.

803
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,560
Yeah, Twain is always twipping.

804
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,060
It's okay to be clumsy sometimes.

805
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,900
Yeah.

806
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,380
Beck is leaning over to Cal.

807
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,440
Do you think that means that the name is Twain or Train?

808
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,820
I have no fucking idea.

809
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,900
Julius tries nine, one, one.

810
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,140
As you're going through the safe

811
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,020
and just like trying repeatedly

812
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
to open it with different random numbers,

813
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,740
you're not having a lot of luck.

814
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,060
But while this conversation is happening

815
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,420
with the child in the main room

816
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
and you're going through all this stuff

817
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,780
by the desk in this back room,

818
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,780
you see that underneath some folders

819
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,540
and there's some mail

820
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,220
and there's a handwritten piece of paper

821
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,180
shoved up in the middle of it.

822
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,740
And it says, I always keep the safe unlocked.

823
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,860
Julius, Julius, just try opening it.

824
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,540
It says it's always kept unlocked.

825
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,420
It's a safe.

826
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,540
It's meant to be hard to get into.

827
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,860
You can't just pass a search check

828
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,980
and get into a safe.

829
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,780
What does your paper say?

830
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,660
The paper.

831
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,500
It just says all that explaining that about safes.

832
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,340
It says.

833
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,160
That's safes.

834
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
As a role-playing mechanic.

835
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,180
As a reminder, safes.

836
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,020
Oh yeah.

837
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,860
Locking.

838
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,680
It should be difficult.

839
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,820
It should feel challenging but rewarding.

840
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,420
Over your players to open one.

841
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,460
It says S.G.Naturhole.

842
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,460
N-A-T-U-R capital H-O-L-E.

843
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,060
The Naturhole, which you all know

844
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,580
is an abandoned baseball stadium in the city.

845
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,860
It was abandoned because there was a sinkhole.

846
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,380
I forgot about this.

847
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,780
In the middle of the infield

848
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,700
that basically eliminated the entire playing area

849
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,700
within the stadium.

850
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,900
However, the stadium seating itself.

851
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,460
Well, plus the triple A team,

852
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,740
the contingent corndogs.

853
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,580
That's right.

854
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,420
Wait, no, they can't play there.

855
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,260
They were.

856
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,820
It's a movie theater now.

857
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,880
Exactly.

858
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,020
And it's a movie theater that we called.

859
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,860
The Naturhole.

860
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,680
The Naturhole.

861
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,060
Shout out to Thomas Cox, not a patron.

862
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:22,540
Just on our, in our session.

863
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,860
Just a friend of the podcast.

864
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,860
In our session zero that is yet to be released.

865
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,380
Our session zero part two for season two.

866
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,020
Unofficial collaborator.

867
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,980
We created the abandoned baseball park.

868
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,120
The Naturhole.

869
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,960
The Naturhole.

870
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,860
The Naturhole.

871
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,540
Currently the movie theater.

872
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,580
Specifically for large events.

873
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,420
The Naturhole.

874
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,620
Wasn't it like also three,

875
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,520
like all the walls were the screen?

876
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

877
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,100
It's like an omni-plex or whatever

878
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,120
where you like look down into this massive screen

879
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,220
and you like, yeah.

880
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,720
It sounds like a suboptimal viewing experience.

881
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,100
They're still figuring it out.

882
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,980
I bet that's cool for five minutes.

883
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,100
And then there underneath where it says SG Naturhole,

884
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,340
it has cross streets,

885
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,020
which are on like the Northeast side of the Naturhole.

886
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,300
And it says, follow down.

887
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,100
Julius grabs that piece of paper.

888
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,140
He's just looking at it.

889
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,620
He grabs it and goes out into the main area with them.

890
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,460
Guys, I think I've found a clue.

891
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,540
And he looks over at the like meal prep area.

892
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,220
I think we should get out of here and go to that meeting.

893
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,640
Beck agrees, Beck.

894
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,860
As soon as he heard her say

895
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,720
that she was just popping out for groceries,

896
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,580
he felt like we're on a time crunch.

897
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,800
Oh yeah, yeah.

898
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,860
If you feel like we were good here,

899
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,020
I think we should probably make ourselves scarce.

900
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,900
You look over at Beck

901
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,660
and he's like sitting crisscross applesauce

902
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,020
and having his nails painted.

903
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,140
And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.

904
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,800
You mean Cal, your own character?

905
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,920
I don't fucking know.

906
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,640
I thought you were saying I was doing that.

907
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,960
That would work too.

908
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,960
Oh, Beck.

909
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,600
Well, she did want to do yours next, but that's okay.

910
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,920
I can do them later.

911
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,760
Let's.

912
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,360
Are you leaving?

913
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm so sorry.

914
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,880
It was so nice to meet you and all your friends.

915
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,320
But anytime, if you feel like you miss us,

916
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,440
you can just tune in to the local news

917
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,400
and you'll see me again.

918
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,560
This is Cal, Colorado saying it was nice to meet you.

919
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,400
Oh, yeah.

920
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,800
Give a little high five.

921
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
Oh, a little high five.

922
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,300
Boop, boop.

923
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,600
Julius is gonna see if he can lift up this safe.

924
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,600
As you go to lift up the safe with those thick thighs,

925
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,960
give me a strength.

926
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,840
You can't pick up a fucking safe.

927
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,200
Five on a 50.

928
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,880
But as you lift it up off the ground,

929
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,040
you see that there's no bottom on it.

930
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,720
Like you're just lifting the top up off.

931
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,820
It's like not connected to its base.

932
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,880
And is there anything on the ground?

933
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,360
Yeah, yeah, there's stacks and stacks of cash.

934
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,500
He's gonna take some, not all.

935
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,720
When you're walking out into the living room,

936
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,080
do you have the cash on you or have you already?

937
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,740
I have it, well, there's that little girl.

938
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,840
Yep, Julius has it in his hands and is like,

939
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,760
guys, he stole from us.

940
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,480
Wow, is that all money?

941
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,600
Monopoly money.

942
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,280
I'm not allowed to play that game yet.

943
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes, it's a cutthroat game,

944
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,400
far too cruel for one of your age.

945
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,620
That's what my mom says.

946
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,460
Where did you get that?

947
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,640
Where did you get that, Julius?

948
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,480
The safe is bad.

949
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,640
The safe was no good.

950
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,920
The safe is bad.

951
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,760
No bottom.

952
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,520
I don't even begin to know what you mean.

953
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,920
He just kept points in the room,

954
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,760
he's like, go check it out.

955
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,600
I think you're pointing at me

956
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,080
like I don't know what he fucking said.

957
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:55,080
I don't know what it means either.

958
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,520
Yeah, Cal, I mean, Cal walks in there like dumbfounded

959
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,640
and sees all the money.

960
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,480
Beck follows.

961
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,840
Yeah, there's probably 35, 40 Gs in here.

962
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,440
But is that all there is?

963
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,260
Oh no, there's a bunch of papers and stuff too.

964
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,680
Julius, put that back

965
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,980
and start filming one of your TikToks.

966
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,820
He does.

967
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,960
Does Cal want to be in it or?

968
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,640
Cal just stands in front of the safe

969
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,000
and says, do a boomerang.

970
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Can you still do boomerang?

971
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,360
Julius.

972
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,680
And he starts dabbing.

973
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,720
Julius puts down the phone and is like,

974
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,080
maybe we shouldn't document this.

975
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,920
No, no, no.

976
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,320
Okay, well, get pictures.

977
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,240
Beck, you're filming, right?

978
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,080
Oh yes.

979
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,180
We need to document that this man

980
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,740
has been paid off by the goddess.

981
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,840
Is the paperwork or anything in there

982
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,920
give any indication where the money came from?

983
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,520
I would like to flip through it as I'm filming.

984
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah, what else is going?

985
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,240
I'm getting scans basically of the documents.

986
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,340
Oh yeah, that's great.

987
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,560
That's what you need to do.

988
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,160
Roll accounting, everyone who's checking this out.

989
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,400
Wow, I have accounting.

990
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,380
Could I roll bureaucracy?

991
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,600
No, I'm going to go with accounting.

992
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,800
I got a crit success, a 33 on a 50.

993
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,840
Okay, that's awesome.

994
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,400
These figures are all a little bit over my head.

995
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
Does anybody know what these mean?

996
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Oh, Julius.

997
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,440
Let me take a look.

998
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,880
You know what this means.

999
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,980
Wilson Wiley seems to be on the payroll

1000
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,600
for some sort of a nonprofit.

1001
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,240
And as you follow the trail of money

1002
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,840
through all of these stacks of papers and papers

1003
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,400
with your keen accounting skills

1004
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,400
and that critical success, you flip through

1005
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,800
and you can draw a direct line from the Godel company

1006
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,240
to a shell, to a shell, to a shell, to a shell,

1007
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,380
to this nonprofit.

1008
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,720
The nonprofit's called Where's The Money?

1009
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,400
I don't know, not here.

1010
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,640
W-A-R.

1011
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,760
W-A-R-E.

1012
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,860
Duh.

1013
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,260
Duh.

1014
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,200
Holy shit.

1015
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,580
There's something big here.

1016
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,260
What is it in a few short words?

1017
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,400
He's on the Godel's payroll, 100%.

1018
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,240
How do you know?

1019
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,060
It's all in here.

1020
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,660
And Julius holds up all the paperwork and documents,

1021
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,780
pockets it, leaves the money.

1022
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,920
He's like, we should go.

1023
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,220
This just became very dangerous.

1024
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,200
I don't know if we need to take anything with us

1025
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,980
because I've got it all on camera.

1026
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,300
Alertness checks, please.

1027
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,060
Crit fail.

1028
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,340
I pass a two on a 40.

1029
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,120
Tell me if I got these out to hand to you also.

1030
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,060
I fail, a 62 on a 40.

1031
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,460
Sorry, I keep meaning to get up and get my own.

1032
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,980
Beck, you're the only one who hears the ding.

1033
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,820
Of the elevator?

1034
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,640
Of the elevator.

1035
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,020
What ding?

1036
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,520
The egg timer on the counter.

1037
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,820
Egg.

1038
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,820
I get big eyes and I, Carol, Julius, that was the elevator.

1039
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,020
I think we really need to get out of here and quick.

1040
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:47,860
Oh, fuck.

1041
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,780
Let's hoof it, boys.

1042
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,820
Julius is gonna keep, he's gonna keep the papers,

1043
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,340
leave everything else and hoof it.

1044
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,560
Thank you so much for your time.

1045
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,740
I would love to have the tea party

1046
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,100
with you and Tereza and Rachel sometime.

1047
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,060
Absolutely, okay.

1048
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,900
Bye, Conquerel.

1049
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,460
Goodbye, and remember what I said about the TV

1050
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,800
and good luck.

1051
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,780
She holds out her arms for a hug.

1052
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,660
If you give her the hug, you're gonna get caught in the room.

1053
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,540
No, no, I give her a high five in each open hand

1054
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,180
and a thumbs up and a wink is like,

1055
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,220
I'm running backwards out the front door.

1056
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,800
Julius says, don't tell anyone we were here.

1057
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,700
Nobody will believe you.

1058
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
The three of you like.

1059
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,540
Shh.

1060
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,140
The three of you slam into the wall,

1061
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,340
like the hall wall on the other side away from this door

1062
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,860
as the door slams shut and you turn

1063
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,260
and looking down the hall,

1064
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,180
you see a woman in her mid thirties

1065
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,460
carrying like four bags of groceries,

1066
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,460
tote bags walking toward you with suspicious eyes

1067
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,380
and I need whoever has the highest bureaucracy.

1068
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,220
I got a 50.

1069
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,060
I got a 70.

1070
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,880
I got a 50.

1071
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,580
To roll.

1072
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,400
35.

1073
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,460
Hello, excuse me.

1074
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,300
Hello, yes.

1075
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,120
Is everything okay?

1076
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,100
Yes, yes, we were looking for apartment 936.

1077
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,980
Oh, one floor up.

1078
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,540
This is the eighth floor.

1079
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,380
Oh.

1080
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,620
I told you, I thought we might have hit that.

1081
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,460
Idiot.

1082
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,180
He always does this.

1083
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,700
He's quite stupid, ma'am.

1084
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,100
Anyway, have a nice day.

1085
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,740
She's smiling, not really paying attention.

1086
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,220
She puts her key in the door and goes in.

1087
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,500
And yeah, I'm like waving nervously

1088
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,700
and frantically pressing the elevator button.

1089
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,340
It's not coming.

1090
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,300
No, it's right there because she just came up on it

1091
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,180
and you hop into the elevator.

1092
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,620
You going up to the ninth?

1093
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,740
Yeah, I press one and as the door is closed,

1094
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,260
I make a show of like being like,

1095
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,940
you pressed one, not nine.

1096
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,260
We'll have to do it all over again.

1097
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,600
Silly man.

1098
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,780
She's like already in her apartment.

1099
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,620
Yeah, she's gone.

1100
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,260
Deep cover.

1101
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,740
How was your friend?

1102
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,700
They were not at home, unfortunately.

1103
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,220
We just sat outside their apartment knocking

1104
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,180
for roughly 15 minutes.

1105
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,020
What a shame.

1106
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,840
Who was it again?

1107
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,500
Oh, we call them Gramps.

1108
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,580
We call them Gramps.

1109
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,420
Oh, oh, Gramps.

1110
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,140
They'll always just be Gramps to us.

1111
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,420
You have a good one, sir.

1112
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,260
Yeah.

1113
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,100
We've got places to be.

1114
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,200
Same to you.

1115
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,960
Grabbing a little persuade on the way out.

1116
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,800
Do I get in on that?

1117
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,500
Yeah, 58 on an 80.

1118
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,440
39 on a 50, yeah, 50.

1119
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,280
You both rolled higher.

1120
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,120
I didn't talk.

1121
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,900
You both rolled higher and therefore he's just like,

1122
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,640
huh, oh, I guess maybe Desmond is Gramps.

1123
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,960
And then he's back to thinking about

1124
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,460
whatever he's thinking about before.

1125
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,200
Just how many times he can jerk off in a day.

1126
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,960
Without thinking it's weird.

1127
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,440
Without thinking it's weird.

1128
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm gonna go pee again for the millionth time.

1129
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,280
I wanna get on record real quick.

1130
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,440
Is anybody else curious why that was a bureaucracy role

1131
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,840
to walk past her or was that a mistake?

1132
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,540
I think he made it up or maybe he didn't.

1133
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,560
Yeah, I never really know.

1134
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,560
Sometimes I think we put not enough faith in Zach

1135
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,140
and sometimes I think we put far too much.

1136
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,120
Yeah, that's why I'm just like, I don't know.

1137
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,960
I don't know.

1138
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,800
I don't know either.

1139
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,620
I don't know.

1140
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,460
Go pee, okay.

1141
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,800
What was the last thing we said?

1142
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,580
Wait, one, two, three, nose goes, nose goes.

1143
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,420
I think that was me.

1144
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,260
It was.

1145
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,120
And we're back and you guys have just headed down

1146
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,640
into the parking garage here,

1147
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,720
hopping in that Mercedes C-Class and heading out,

1148
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,840
saying goodbye to the nice gentleman

1149
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,400
who's waiting at the elevator,

1150
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,040
thinking about J and O.

1151
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
My Dave!

1152
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,920
How we looking on time?

1153
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,960
Oh, time?

1154
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,240
It is time.

1155
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,780
You see a text on your phone right now.

1156
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,740
What's it say?

1157
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,280
And it just says ETA question mark

1158
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,740
because it is time for you to be at the can station.

1159
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,960
Tell him we're caught in construction on the freeway.

1160
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,520
It's gonna be a little while,

1161
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,640
but we're bringing him the story of a lifetime

1162
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,600
and we're going to fucking Richard Riley's house.

1163
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,720
I text type traffic

1164
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,880
and then we head to Richard Riley's house.

1165
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,280
Oh, shit.

1166
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,400
We could also like make it like a Zoom call

1167
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,620
and just do it from here.

1168
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,340
Maybe we can find that idea.

1169
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,680
We need the footage first, but yes, that could work.

1170
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,680
After I send traffic, I say FaceTime question mark.

1171
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,760
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

1172
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,720
Okay, guys, it's time for...

1173
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,740
Hey, what's up my fucking nephew?

1174
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,360
How you living?

1175
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,360
Oh, it's good to be me and it's good to be you,

1176
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,740
but you are not here.

1177
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,920
And you said you were gonna be here.

1178
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,720
What the fuck is up?

1179
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,280
Not base bro, not base bro.

1180
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,320
Forget about it.

1181
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,720
Yeah, I mean, it's a good thing that we got

1182
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,640
Cloud Atlas in Cal's car

1183
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,040
because the traffic is just crazy.

1184
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,040
A phenomenal film takes me back to my Lake Tahoe days.

1185
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,480
From the womb to the tomb, right?

1186
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,320
Yes, sir, and I am hungry to see you.

1187
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,280
Where is Cal?

1188
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,120
Where's Beck?

1189
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,940
Where are you?

1190
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,280
I kind of show the car,

1191
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,340
trying not to like let him see that the traffic

1192
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,980
may not be as bad as we said,

1193
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,140
but I show like Cal and Beck.

1194
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,400
I'm like, they're in the car here with me.

1195
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,240
Say hi, guys.

1196
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,040
Beck gives a wave as the camera pans.

1197
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,880
Yeah, Cal gives a little salute and says,

1198
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,520
great to see you, Typh.

1199
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,000
Hey, we're working on the story of a lifetime here.

1200
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,440
I think you're gonna like what your nephew serves up to you.

1201
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,280
Obviously, traffic's a little behind

1202
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,080
and we're always pursuing any possible lead.

1203
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,200
I'm sitting here driving

1204
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,120
and I'm telling Beck what to film for some good B-roll

1205
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,120
and also he's Googling different sources

1206
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,320
and calling them and things.

1207
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,080
I'm not worried about whether you're working or not.

1208
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,120
I just gotta have the three of you come in right now.

1209
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,920
Well, as soon as traffic permits, we'll be there,

1210
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,400
but we're really, oh, Cal honks on his horn.

1211
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,720
He's like, beep, beep, beep, you dummy.

1212
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,600
Yeah, it's just real nuts out here.

1213
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,040
Lots of wrecks, lots of construction.

1214
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,680
Oh, wow, I think I just saw another one.

1215
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,520
Oh.

1216
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,340
Another one.

1217
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,300
Ah, like I said, well, I'm hungry for you to come on back,

1218
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,840
so get on back here.

1219
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,520
Yeah, yeah, are you actually hungry?

1220
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,480
We could stop and get some food for you.

1221
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,320
No, no, absolutely.

1222
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,160
We'll go ahead and do that.

1223
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
We'll add that to the list.

1224
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,360
Do not stop.

1225
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,800
Oh, wow, horrible reception.

1226
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,180
Cal's just doing that.

1227
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,640
And I'm like, uh, oh, eh, uh.

1228
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,240
And like Julius is like freezing his face

1229
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,800
and like making that sound and then.

1230
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,240
He can see like the traffic behind you moving smoothly.

1231
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,080
Like.

1232
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,240
Oh, that was strange.

1233
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,280
We'll be in by the end of the day.

1234
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,480
All right, end of the day.

1235
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,440
I mean, I need you here right away,

1236
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,400
straight here right now, okay?

1237
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,440
Otherwise it's back to Barstow for you, Julius.

1238
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,820
Cause I ain't going back to Barstow, that's all you.

1239
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,520
I thought you said Barstool.

1240
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,320
Ah, no, I didn't.

1241
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,720
I don't want to work for that guy.

1242
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,840
No, ew, ew.

1243
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,800
Who would ever want to work for a guy like that

1244
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,880
when you go work for me, bro?

1245
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,560
Julius kind of looks at Cal and Beck like.

1246
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,680
I've heard him say many times at the Foundry

1247
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,240
that his dream job is to work for Barstool.

1248
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,960
We'll be in ASAP.

1249
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,800
I don't know your dream job, Julius.

1250
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,800
You'll have to tell me after this call.

1251
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,640
He hangs up.

1252
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,280
He says like bye, but that he kind of hangs up.

1253
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,720
Julius would love to work for Barstool Sports.

1254
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,040
Hello, this is Julius Summers.

1255
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,760
Welcome back to Call Me Daddy.

1256
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,800
These thighs were made for Barstool.

1257
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,680
What is that guy's name?

1258
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,320
Dave something?

1259
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,160
Portnoy.

1260
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,000
I was going to say it's Portnoy.

1261
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,840
Port something.

1262
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,680
Portnoy, yeah.

1263
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,520
Dave Cooley.

1264
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,480
The drummer for, all right, let's go.

1265
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,600
Oh, Will Ferrell.

1266
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,160
The drummer for Will Ferrell.

1267
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,300
Okay, I'm going to try to watch some more Cloud Atlas

1268
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,560
before we get to Richard's house.

1269
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,760
I mean, couldn't you be doing something more productive

1270
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,160
like editing a TikTok?

1271
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,260
We are at work.

1272
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,740
I mean, I don't think Julius has any TikToks to edit.

1273
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,820
He's going to post, he'll post a Grover's Gorge TikTok.

1274
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,860
Nice.

1275
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,700
A good one.

1276
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,980
A little teaser.

1277
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,860
Another little tease.

1278
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,340
Another little tease.

1279
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,260
Yes, we can.

1280
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,260
When you go on, you see that the previous two TikToks

1281
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,200
that you've uploaded with Grover's Gorge footage

1282
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,300
have been deleted.

1283
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,420
Julius immediately goes to the settings

1284
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,420
and changes the password for the TikTok.

1285
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,980
Okay, I'm going to have you roll

1286
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,980
because it might send an email

1287
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,140
that you have to change the password to,

1288
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,100
but it might two-factor you.

1289
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,700
Well, you could see what email it would be sending to.

1290
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Let's just get a luck roll since we're playing a dice game.

1291
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,180
I want under 50.

1292
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,020
No, actually.

1293
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,420
88.

1294
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,260
Oh, no.

1295
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,980
Oh, boy.

1296
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,180
That's the worst one.

1297
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,140
You're locked out.

1298
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,420
You're not sure what happened,

1299
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,260
but when you go to TikTok on your browser,

1300
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,980
that most recent TikTok, also not there,

1301
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,020
and a new text from Tyf, come in now.

1302
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,540
Oh, shit.

1303
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,580
Julius does not share that information and-

1304
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh, shit!

1305
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,300
Julius thinks if they go talk to Tyf,

1306
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,780
they're not going to, this story's done.

1307
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,780
So he wants to get done what he can now.

1308
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,500
How's that TikTok coming, buddy?

1309
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,500
I'm working on it.

1310
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,420
Forgot the password.

1311
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,580
If you just hit forgot password,

1312
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,380
I think it'll send you.

1313
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,300
Zach, when you said deleted,

1314
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,660
did you meant deleted by the user

1315
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,660
or deleted removed by TikTok?

1316
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,540
How would you be able to see a difference?

1317
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,440
You would only know from the poster's end.

1318
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,940
It would tell you if it had been removed.

1319
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,780
Oh, yeah.

1320
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,260
No, there wasn't a notification that it had been flagged.

1321
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,780
Good question, because some content on there

1322
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,540
could have definitely been flagged.

1323
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,460
This TikTok made me feel bad.

1324
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:40,300
Or misinformation, and Godel has TikTok too.

1325
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,340
Uh-oh, vroom, vroom, right?

1326
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,300
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

1327
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,820
We're here.

1328
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,900
Are we at the home of Richard Reilly

1329
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,540
or are we at the can station?

1330
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,940
Where do you think, sucker?

1331
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,620
It's the mill all over again.

1332
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,860
On your way, you get into a fiery wreck.

1333
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,680
Yeah.

1334
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,580
These characters die and everything they know dies with them.

1335
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,940
I'm done with you.

1336
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,280
You're all playing Rachel now.

1337
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,540
Wait, Rachel.

1338
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,380
Wait, Rachel.

1339
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,180
Inside the city, there's a gated community, a suburb.

1340
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,580
Wow, that's expensive.

1341
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,940
That is where Richard Reilly lives.

1342
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,180
He is an officer of the city police department

1343
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,700
and you are pulling up to a guard house outside of a gate.

1344
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,380
Is it Dave's twin brother?

1345
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,260
Think about that for a second, Julius.

1346
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,140
Wouldn't they have the same last name?

1347
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,700
No, the guard.

1348
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,340
I didn't catch Dave's last name.

1349
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,620
It's a guy who looks suspiciously like Dave.

1350
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:01,060
The slightly better off brother of the two.

1351
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,220
He gets to sit down.

1352
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,040
A little more hair.

1353
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,880
Yeah, out.

1354
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,460
More hair, better person.

1355
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,300
Right.

1356
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,540
Joe flicks his fucking Fabio, man.

1357
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,620
Kind of looking around, I'm like, I see what you mean.

1358
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,140
It's crazy how much hair comes out of my head

1359
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,580
and it still looks this good.

1360
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,420
Fuck you.

1361
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,560
Well, hello there.

1362
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,660
Whoa, Dave.

1363
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,960
Oh, I've always been called that my whole life, but no.

1364
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,740
And he taps slowly on his name badge.

1365
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,580
Darren.

1366
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,400
Hello, Darren.

1367
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,740
I'm Cal Colorado from the news.

1368
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,300
Whoa, it's been a while, sir.

1369
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,860
We're actually doing a report on a local security agents.

1370
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,820
Heroes.

1371
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,300
Local security heroes.

1372
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,740
Whoa, and you want to interview me?

1373
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,580
I do want to interview you, Darren.

1374
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,140
But first-

1375
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,300
Do you have a shot of adrenaline or anything?

1376
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,380
I'm sure we've got something back here,

1377
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,020
but I can Venmo you and you can source that yourself.

1378
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,580
But first we need to see an old family friend

1379
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,140
who lives in the inside.

1380
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,900
Could you let us in real quick so we can check on them?

1381
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,060
They had a small gift they wanted to give.

1382
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,180
Yeah, who are you going to see?

1383
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,060
Oh, we just call them Gramps.

1384
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,980
Will it work again?

1385
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,220
Will it blend?

1386
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,680
Will it blend, will it blend?

1387
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,620
26 pass.

1388
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,660
60 pass.

1389
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,500
Fuck you.

1390
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,860
Nice.

1391
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,940
Gramps, Gramps, Gramps, Gramps.

1392
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,420
Yeah, well, we're worried

1393
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,020
there's not much more time with Gramps.

1394
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,060
And he said he had something he really wanted to give us.

1395
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,380
But afterwards, we'll come interview you.

1396
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,900
Well, that makes me awfully excited

1397
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,780
as he clicks the button and says,

1398
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,140
tell Gramps hello and have a good day.

1399
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,460
See you soon.

1400
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,920
I'm sure he will be happy to hear from you.

1401
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,800
He speaks so highly of you and all his letters.

1402
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,760
Oh, me, wah, and you.

1403
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,640
He's beautiful, but he's dying.

1404
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,280
And we're looking for the house

1405
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,600
that has like the metal archway that says Riley on it.

1406
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,300
Gross.

1407
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah, there's a big one there, huh?

1408
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,600
And it's got like a shield on one side

1409
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,960
and a eagle on the other.

1410
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,160
Like, you know, laser cut into the metal.

1411
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,440
It says Lorem Ipsum.

1412
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,040
Yeah, you know, we just got some cool

1413
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,240
Latin shit put up there.

1414
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,080
Roll luck and answer the question.

1415
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,960
Well, we have to answer the question and then roll luck.

1416
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,760
What's the question?

1417
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,880
The question is,

1418
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,820
would you like there to be a car in the driveway?

1419
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,680
Seems like something you shouldn't have decided.

1420
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,580
I'll roll then.

1421
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,540
A lack of preparation on your part

1422
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,780
does not represent a crisis on ours.

1423
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,500
There is a minivan in the driveway.

1424
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,640
You said car.

1425
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,820
There is a station wagon.

1426
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,660
Damn it.

1427
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,920
He still made a family.

1428
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:41,660
That's a nice one.

1429
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,500
Cal brings like the C class.

1430
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,660
Actually, no, there's a shitty station wagon

1431
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,500
in the driveway.

1432
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,660
Oh, cause he doesn't.

1433
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,960
He hates his family.

1434
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,060
I hate my wife.

1435
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,940
Cal brings the C class to like a stop nearby

1436
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,700
and he's like peering over the steering wheel

1437
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,340
and kind of glaring at the scene.

1438
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,020
He's like, what do you think boys?

1439
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,140
I mean, I think as bad as much as I've ever thought

1440
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,220
this whole time.

1441
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,740
We got to get the footage, but I don't know how.

1442
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,380
I mean, do we just talk to him?

1443
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,220
I mean, we could confront him and you know,

1444
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,480
his reaction is kind of some sort of, you know, evidence,

1445
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,100
but I don't know.

1446
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,940
Maybe if we like.

1447
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,300
I don't think this is his car.

1448
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,140
First of all,

1449
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,140
I think we're going to be dealing with another mom.

1450
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:29,980
Yeah.

1451
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,180
Well, I can take the mom.

1452
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,940
Julius son, no offense,

1453
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,880
but you should leave the mom to me.

1454
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,100
And with that,

1455
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,620
Julius is instilled with the confidence of the group

1456
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,340
and rings the doorbell.

1457
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,100
No, thank you.

1458
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,420
Cal, Cal, use your voice.

1459
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,260
Hit him with it, Cal.

1460
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,120
Hello, ma'am.

1461
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,820
It's Cal Colorado City Action News

1462
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,480
is your husband home.

1463
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,320
Jesus Christ.

1464
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,160
Roll that.

1465
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,060
That's the stuff.

1466
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,400
That's the stuff.

1467
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Roll what?

1468
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,300
Persuade, I think, or charisma.

1469
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,420
33 crit success.

1470
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,900
Holy fucking shit.

1471
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,300
Door swings open.

1472
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,020
Curlers, robe, cigarette.

1473
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,140
She goes, he never is.

1474
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,620
Cal like turns to you guys and has like a shocked look

1475
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,460
on his face.

1476
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,280
He's like, ah.

1477
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,640
She turns around, starts walking away from you

1478
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,760
and yelling over her shoulder essentially.

1479
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,680
I thought this big house would be better

1480
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,480
than leaving me alone in a shitty apartment.

1481
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,560
And I guess that's right, but fuck.

1482
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,960
Not much better it would seem.

1483
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,400
Well, you know, a woman needs attention, care,

1484
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,800
someone to love them.

1485
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,440
Yes, don't we all?

1486
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,340
Would you?

1487
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,440
She's pouring a drink.

1488
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,600
A bourbon neat, please.

1489
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,040
Oh, Beck, what would you like?

1490
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,120
Um, red bull and vodka?

1491
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,040
And Julius, this is young Julius,

1492
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,520
our new executive producer.

1493
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,240
He's kind of a rising star here at Cannes.

1494
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,680
Oh, are ya?

1495
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,240
I'd like to think that I am,

1496
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,480
but you know, I've got a lot to learn from the man.

1497
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,320
Well, if it's a ladder to climb,

1498
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,880
you'll have no problem.

1499
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,640
As she eyes you down and down.

1500
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,800
It's like, what does that mean?

1501
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,560
I was like, how does she know he's a corporate striver?

1502
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,480
She can smell it on.

1503
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,760
She can see through into men's souls.

1504
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,520
Julius flexes his thighs

1505
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,520
and you can hear like a little seam rip.

1506
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,480
Ooh, I got a little pumpin' at the lake earlier.

1507
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,920
What business do you have with my husband?

1508
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,800
Well, as she hands you each your drink.

1509
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,640
Oh, thank you.

1510
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,680
Thank you very much.

1511
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,800
What was your name, ma'am?

1512
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,640
Debs.

1513
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,160
Debs Richards?

1514
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,560
Debs Richards.

1515
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,280
Debs, Debs Riley. Richard's wife?

1516
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,000
Wow, is that all I am?

1517
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,840
Of Richard?

1518
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,000
That seems like all I am.

1519
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,840
He drags me around to these places

1520
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,040
to show me off black tie events

1521
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,200
with a bunch of the worst people in the fuckin' world.

1522
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,360
Oh, what do you mean by that?

1523
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,000
Charities, nonprofits, you know the type.

1524
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,840
Ah, yes.

1525
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,240
Yeah, evil people.

1526
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,120
Such ghouls.

1527
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,520
What is his rank in the police force?

1528
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,360
Wouldn't know it.

1529
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,760
Talking to him these days, the head on him.

1530
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,280
Just an officer.

1531
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,120
I see, and what is he doing

1532
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,760
at all these charity functions

1533
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,640
with the who's who of the city?

1534
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,440
He's rubbing elbows.

1535
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,680
He's having a good time.

1536
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,920
He's making friends.

1537
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,840
Well, you used to have to,

1538
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,680
you usually have to show up

1539
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,080
to those kinds of things with cash.

1540
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,560
I mean, I've hosted the Cal Colorado-

1541
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,680
Comedy Hour.

1542
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,960
Hold on, what should it be for?

1543
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,240
Youth sports.

1544
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,840
Youth sports is solid.

1545
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,400
I've hosted the Cal Colorado Junior-

1546
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,080
Damn it.

1547
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,000
Debate League.

1548
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,520
That's good.

1549
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,880
That's really good.

1550
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,680
I've hosted the Cal Colorado Black Tie Fundraiser

1551
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,320
for Children's Leukemia for the last 15 years.

1552
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,320
Oh wow, how much you make off that?

1553
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,880
Oh, I don't make anything, ma'am.

1554
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,560
In fact, a great deal of my own personal money

1555
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,480
goes into it each year,

1556
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,760
but we've raised over $20 million in that time.

1557
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,600
Wow.

1558
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,440
Wow.

1559
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,760
Wow, wow.

1560
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,880
Perhaps you'd like to go with Julius this year.

1561
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,240
She looks up at your eyes.

1562
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,880
Yeah, we know about the thighs.

1563
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,240
How are Julius's eyes?

1564
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,360
Julius says, my thighs are down here.

1565
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,400
We were supposed to pick up some important stuff

1566
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,480
from your husband.

1567
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,920
He said he'd be here,

1568
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,800
but we can just, we're kind of in a hurry.

1569
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,640
We can just grab it.

1570
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,080
If you just point us to the office,

1571
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,880
we'll be right, right as rain.

1572
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,800
I don't care.

1573
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,480
I'm in my cups and he crit succeeded, so.

1574
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,720
Oh, when was that?

1575
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,080
Oh, I mean, as soon as I heard you

1576
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,240
on the other side of the door.

1577
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,120
Oh, you mean me?

1578
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,680
Yeah.

1579
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,120
Oh.

1580
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,720
I was giving you a lot of credit as a game master

1581
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,920
and you're like, you had rolled out their interaction

1582
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,440
as a couple earlier this morning.

1583
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,520
He crit succeeded.

1584
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,960
I'm like, what's that?

1585
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,080
And he's like, don't fucking worry about it.

1586
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,080
Don't fucking worry about it.

1587
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,720
Yes, your husband was reviewing some footage for us

1588
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,440
in a capacity as a expert consultant.

1589
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,360
We needed to see a law man's opinion of things.

1590
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,200
Footage?

1591
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,400
No, he said he was taking the footage to the nature hole.

1592
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,560
The nature hole?

1593
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,400
Yeah.

1594
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,320
Cal slams his drink and he says, thank you very much, man.

1595
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,680
Dude.

1596
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,520
Thanks, man.

1597
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,360
Thanks, bro.

1598
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,800
Thanks, man deuces.

1599
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,560
Thank you very much, man.

1600
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,680
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

1601
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,560
I just remembered we're late for our interview with Darren,

1602
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,000
your gatekeeper, but.

1603
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,400
Oh, I love Darren.

1604
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,720
He's a good guy, right?

1605
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,120
Yeah, you can send him in.

1606
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,960
Cal is like scribbling down a number and he's like,

1607
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,360
if you have anything else you'd like to contribute

1608
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,680
to the story, you can reach Julius here at any time.

1609
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,880
She takes it.

1610
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,800
She slips it into her pocket.

1611
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,080
Julius is heading towards the door

1612
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,480
and he says, I'll see you later, I guess.

1613
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,520
Lorem Ipsum.

1614
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,880
Don't blow it, kid.

1615
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,120
No, it's charming.

1616
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,720
Guys, we gotta get to the hole.

1617
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,560
We've got to get to the nature hole.

1618
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,640
The nature hole, that's where our footage is?

1619
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,720
That's what she said, right?

1620
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,760
Do you think it's our footage?

1621
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,200
What other footage would he have?

1622
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,640
That's true, he's just a cop.

1623
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,040
He's just a stupid cop.

1624
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,840
And the nature hole's on this piece of paper

1625
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,320
that we found, too.

1626
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,160
What?

1627
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,920
The connection.

1628
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,480
Oh yeah, you here, look.

1629
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,400
SG, nature hole.

1630
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,880
There's some streets here and it says, follow down.

1631
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,720
Let's go.

1632
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,840
Can crew away.

1633
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:22,640
Thomas, Joe, take off your headphones, please.

1634
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,400
I've got something for this.

1635
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,760
I remember to bring my headphones

1636
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,760
so I don't have to wiggle in my ears.

1637
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,920
It's really tiring when it goes on for like six minutes.

1638
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,040
Sex minutes.

1639
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,480
Chicken off only at six.

1640
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,080
When you Google nature hole,

1641
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,520
drill bits on Alibaba come up.

1642
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,760
Interesting.

1643
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,600
That's one of my favorite bands.

1644
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,440
Did you do that?

1645
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,120
They opened up for Wet Lake.

1646
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,600
Drill bits on Alibaba.

1647
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,440
For real?

1648
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,280
Yeah.

1649
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,120
For real?

1650
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,840
So, Thomas, Joe.

1651
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,680
Cool, neither one of them reacted.

1652
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,520
Hey, Luke.

1653
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,680
They're good at pretending.

1654
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,840
To what?

1655
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,320
Hey, you get a text on your phone?

1656
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,160
Duh.

1657
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah.

1658
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,840
It's from-

1659
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,680
Type.

1660
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,520
Yeah.

1661
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,360
What's it say?

1662
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,320
Love ya.

1663
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,160
Nephew.

1664
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,360
What does it say?

1665
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,960
It does, it starts off, I love you, nephew.

1666
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,680
I need you to come and bring Beck and Cal.

1667
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,400
I text Beck, yeah, for sure.

1668
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,840
Like I said, end of day.

1669
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,920
By the end of the day.

1670
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,800
He texts Beck, he says,

1671
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,880
this is good news, come right now.

1672
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,240
Is there any, can I humant a text?

1673
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,160
I say, just like, what's it about?

1674
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,520
A promotion, is the response.

1675
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,120
Julius has a new number one priority.

1676
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,200
Yeah.

1677
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,040
Yeah.

1678
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:49,880
Should we bird him?

1679
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,720
Let's bird him.

1680
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,880
Caw, caw, caw, bird, bird, bird noise, bird noise.

1681
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,800
I am a bird.

1682
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,000
If you're a bird.

1683
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,840
What kind of bird are you?

1684
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,840
I'm a bird.

1685
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,920
What kind of bird am I?

1686
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,960
One that eats like bugs off a rhino.

1687
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,800
No.

1688
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,760
Oh, should we came in too early

1689
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,720
and now we found out that he turned into a bird.

1690
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,680
What kind of bird are you, Joe?

1691
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,800
Big bird.

1692
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,640
Big bird.

1693
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,160
Thomas the bird?

1694
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,840
The kind that eats birds like you for breakfast.

1695
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,680
Dang.

1696
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,160
You guys are driving vroom vroom.

1697
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,200
Cal, you are behind the wheel.

1698
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,520
You know that the natur hole is off

1699
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,520
in a different direction than the can station.

1700
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,320
It's gonna make you even later to this meeting

1701
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,960
than you already are if you head that way.

1702
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,360
Guys, I hate to say it, but I think, you know,

1703
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,240
we have to have jobs in order to break news

1704
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,680
and type's not happy.

1705
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,280
I think we ought to stop by the station

1706
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,640
before we go out there.

1707
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,480
Yeah.

1708
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,840
I mean, we could even, if you feel like we have to,

1709
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,040
we can maybe talk around the issue while we're there.

1710
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,760
You know, that we kind of feel them out.

1711
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,360
Yeah, maybe I left the footage at my house

1712
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,560
or just kind of give them the run around if we have to.

1713
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,720
I mean, you can link them to the TikToks, right?

1714
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,320
You can show them some of what we've got.

1715
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,160
Yeah.

1716
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,080
Because once he sees what we have, I mean-

1717
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,600
It's like proof of concept, yeah.

1718
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,060
Yeah, I'm sure I'll be like,

1719
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,880
what are you even doing in my office?

1720
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,400
Get back out there and follow the story.

1721
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,080
The TikToks got deleted.

1722
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:14,920
What do you mean?

1723
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,120
I didn't want to worry you or anything,

1724
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,000
but I wanted to go to Richard's,

1725
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,680
but I think he deleted the TikToks or someone did.

1726
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,920
Oh, I thought you were going to interview me.

1727
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,200
Okay, bye.

1728
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,420
Oh, I think that we're not even close.

1729
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,180
He said that to himself like 10 minutes

1730
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,180
after you guys left.

1731
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,440
They're gone.

1732
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:37,600
Yeah, so-

1733
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,160
Took him that long to say it.

1734
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:43,200
I mean, I was going to tell you, I kind of had forgotten,

1735
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,920
but I didn't want to tell you-

1736
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,760
He combed his hair.

1737
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,400
So that we didn't go to Richard's.

1738
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,080
I think, you know,

1739
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,160
somebody's been deleting the TikToks.

1740
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,840
Tyve is not happy with us.

1741
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,880
I think we got to go.

1742
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,120
I think we got to go talk to him.

1743
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,040
It sounds like he wants to shut us down.

1744
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,380
That adds a new wrinkle that, yeah,

1745
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,520
that sounds like he's maybe,

1746
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,440
I'm sorry, Julius, but maybe he's in on this?

1747
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,780
Yes, as the Blues Brothers say,

1748
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,400
this is track four, by the way.

1749
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,720
It's cheaper to keep her about our jobs,

1750
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,680
but I don't know,

1751
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,980
it sounds like he doesn't want us to do our jobs.

1752
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,080
If we get the footage,

1753
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,640
we could sell it to any news agency in the world.

1754
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,040
It's true, we might need to start thinking global.

1755
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,680
We can go beyond these bastards.

1756
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,800
Wouldn't it be easier to just keep our jobs

1757
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,080
and do it here, though?

1758
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,120
We have a lead on where the footage is right now.

1759
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,420
If we don't act, we might never get it back.

1760
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,540
Julius has a point, though,

1761
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:36,760
that if we can maybe do some creative talking to Tyve,

1762
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,120
maybe we'll get some resources

1763
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,960
that can help us with our actual goal.

1764
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,180
And we can just buy some time.

1765
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,720
I mean, he's not going to fire us immediately

1766
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,360
if, you know, we don't really tell him exactly

1767
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,760
if he's on Godel's side, then.

1768
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,520
We could even play the fool and be like,

1769
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:55,200
yeah, this is for the good of Godel.

1770
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,420
Cal slams the brakes, and he says,

1771
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,460
I didn't nearly die in that piss-shit common blood pit

1772
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,420
just to lose the evidence of it.

1773
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,180
No one's gonna call Cal Colorado a liar about this.

1774
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:08,640
If you wanna go see Tyve, take a fucking Uber.

1775
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,340
I'm going to the natural hole.

1776
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,760
I'm getting my story.

1777
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,640
Take off your headphones real quick, Thomas and Joe.

1778
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,320
As both a player and as Julius, I am torn.

1779
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,520
You get a new text.

1780
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,480
It says, just you is fine.

1781
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,320
On my way.

1782
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,140
Birds?

1783
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,020
Birds.

1784
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,920
I can't have me getting fired on my resume.

1785
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,640
I gotta go see my uncle.

1786
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,280
Will you guys please come with me?

1787
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,600
Yeah, um.

1788
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,560
Beck, go with him.

1789
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,720
Yeah, I'll come, I'll come, Julius.

1790
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,600
Cal, we should all go together,

1791
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,560
but we just gotta check in with Tyve.

1792
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,480
I think he's gonna fire you anyway, Julius.

1793
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:40,320
Well.

1794
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,480
I think you tell him to go fuck himself.

1795
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,840
If you're gonna go.

1796
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,680
You'll get a job once you put out

1797
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,700
the greatest news story of all time.

1798
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,100
I gotta go, but if you're gonna go anyway,

1799
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,740
Beck, you should be there to document it.

1800
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,720
I can do it on my own.

1801
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,980
It's, it's just my uncle.

1802
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,920
Hey, remember that we lost God?

1803
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,760
Yeah.

1804
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,060
Yeah, no, I wouldn't let Cal go alone.

1805
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:08,420
I'm just, if Julius is saying that we need to go to Tyve,

1806
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,340
I don't, I don't know.

1807
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,900
It feels like maybe, maybe we should go see Tyve

1808
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,540
and then go to the natural hole.

1809
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,080
Call him again.

1810
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,880
Actually, I'm going to call him.

1811
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,720
Oh, okay.

1812
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,800
Cal calls Tyve.

1813
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,400
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

1814
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,760
Hey, it's my guy, Cal Colorado.

1815
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:25,620
How are you?

1816
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,380
Oh, well, not very great, Tyve.

1817
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,880
Yeah, get your ass down here.

1818
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,120
I got some great fucking news for you.

1819
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,800
You wanna be sitting at that head anchor desk again?

1820
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,240
I take the phone off speaker.

1821
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,080
Julius is looking at Beck like, Beck is giving thumbs up.

1822
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,460
Holy shit, holy shit.

1823
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:41,300
What do you mean?

1824
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,460
I got an opportunity.

1825
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,320
It's promotion time, but I need you and Julius

1826
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,520
and Beck to come in.

1827
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,760
Why do you need us to come in?

1828
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,040
Because we have to do the paperwork

1829
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,960
for your new promotion, of course.

1830
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,840
I've got to tell you, Tyve,

1831
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,580
we're working on something really big here.

1832
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:55,420
I don't care.

1833
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,720
I think the paperwork can wait.

1834
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,000
It's going to be great.

1835
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,500
I need you to come in now.

1836
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,560
It's my promotion, Tyve, so.

1837
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,800
Well, we'll see.

1838
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,380
Isabella feels real confident in that spot, you know?

1839
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:07,720
So I want to give it to you,

1840
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,200
but I need you guys to come in.

1841
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,480
Tyve, you've already taken this from me once.

1842
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,000
I don't know if I trust your word,

1843
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,120
but if you love Julius, if you love me,

1844
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,380
if you actually care about your job here at the news,

1845
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,240
you're going to want to let us pursue this story.

1846
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,160
I love my job.

1847
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,720
I love my life.

1848
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,920
And I need you to come in.

1849
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,860
So it's either that,

1850
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,760
or I think we're going to have to have some harsher words.

1851
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,580
Tyve?

1852
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,420
Unfortunately.

1853
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,900
Beck has given signals to get Cal's attention.

1854
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,400
Joe is pointing down.

1855
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,360
He's trying to muffle the receiver.

1856
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,200
Joe is playing in a screwable game of tricks.

1857
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,600
Muffle the receiver.

1858
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,920
Muffle it.

1859
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,860
Take it off your ear and muffle it.

1860
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,640
I take it off my ear and like make a play show

1861
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,480
of putting it on mute.

1862
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,280
And he's like, I know about you.

1863
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,540
Oh shit, hell yeah, Cal.

1864
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,800
Dude, Cal, if he's offering to make you an anchor,

1865
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,240
that's a win-win for us because you'll have the desk.

1866
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,040
He can't tell you shit once you're live on air.

1867
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,200
We just run the footage.

1868
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,760
We're talking about to tape right now.

1869
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,160
If you're on air and I put that thing in the video bay.

1870
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,200
But we don't have the tape.

1871
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,880
We'll have to get it, but I'm saying.

1872
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,760
He's got it.

1873
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,240
Or someone working with him.

1874
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,620
Or the people paying them both.

1875
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:15,460
Don't you see?

1876
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:16,280
Tyfe's in on it.

1877
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,120
Tyfe wants to kill it.

1878
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,280
I don't think you're wrong,

1879
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,520
but I also think that we can still make.

1880
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,560
The anchor job is never going to happen.

1881
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,620
He's trying to play me.

1882
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,000
Unless he wants to put you on anchor to shut you up

1883
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,340
and stop investigating.

1884
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,660
That's exactly what he wants.

1885
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,460
I'm saying we can get you on anchor and then we use that.

1886
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,360
He promises it to me, but then never gives it.

1887
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,200
Don't you see?

1888
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,000
He can't control us outside of the office.

1889
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,240
That's exactly my point.

1890
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,760
We're outside of the office.

1891
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,080
He cannot control us.

1892
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,160
But I'm saying if we go now to the natural

1893
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,200
and he just does straight up fire us.

1894
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,020
So what?

1895
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:45,860
We post it on TikTok.

1896
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,200
We make a new TikTok.

1897
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,560
We're locked out of the can TikTok.

1898
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,680
It keeps getting deleted.

1899
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,080
We'll make a cow TikTok.

1900
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,640
But none of this is live on air.

1901
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,160
This is all things that they control.

1902
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,680
We've already seen that they got TikTok under wraps.

1903
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,860
We'll make a new TikTok.

1904
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,560
I think that they have the ability to take that stuff down.

1905
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,120
What I'm saying is that we have the chance

1906
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,640
to put this in front of eyeballs,

1907
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,440
no matter who tells you no.

1908
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,760
Once we get you on air live.

1909
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,840
We have that if we have the footage, no matter what.

1910
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,800
We can ship it to a dozen news agencies.

1911
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,080
We can put it live on as many platforms as possible.

1912
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,080
It's not live then though.

1913
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,640
It's all to tape and they get to decide when they run it.

1914
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,080
Beck, I'm talking about the internet.

1915
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:20,920
Yeah.

1916
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,400
Guys, I'm gonna have to go.

1917
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,540
Are you coming?

1918
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,240
I would strongly advise against you going to that meeting.

1919
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,620
Your uncle is not looking out for your best interests

1920
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,220
and your career will live beyond this,

1921
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:34,080
especially if you're part of the most legendary news story

1922
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:34,900
of all time.

1923
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,360
The movie's happening in this car, Julius.

1924
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,800
He looks at Cloud Atlas.

1925
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,840
Hey, hey, I know Tom Hanks is magnetic in that movie.

1926
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,540
It's one of my favorites,

1927
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:48,920
but if you ever want to be the kind of person

1928
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,080
who produces the next Cloud Atlas

1929
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:55,320
or runs City Action News or a national news station,

1930
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,440
this story is how you get your foot in that door,

1931
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,440
not your uncle.

1932
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,040
If he fires you, screw him.

1933
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,960
I'll give you every recommendation in the world.

1934
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,520
Ty fangs up.

1935
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,160
Oh yeah, we kept him on mute for like seven minutes.

1936
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,000
I don't know, Cal.

1937
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,160
I think if I'm gonna do this, it's all about who, you know?

1938
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,560
And I don't want to be like a Snowden or something

1939
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,400
and get sent off because of the Godel company.

1940
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,240
I gotta go.

1941
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,280
And yeah, Julius just kind of looks at Cal and Beck

1942
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,440
and like Beck looks at Cal.

1943
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,600
Cal, you know I'm gonna follow you wherever we go,

1944
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,620
but I think that Julius has a point here.

1945
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:30,000
We're going two different ways, Beck.

1946
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,800
Who you go with is up to you.

1947
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,640
Julius orders a Uber.

1948
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,380
Yeah, no, Cal, I'm your cameraman.

1949
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,560
I'll meet back up with you guys.

1950
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,400
I'll make sure he doesn't fire you.

1951
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,600
Julius, don't go.

1952
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,000
A tear runs down Julius's eye

1953
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,240
as he waits for the car to stop and gets out.

1954
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,080
Car's been stopped.

1955
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,120
He looks at the...

1956
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,400
What are you waiting for?

1957
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,280
My Harry Anderson juke.

1958
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,980
Go on, get out of here.

1959
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,560
As the credits roll on Cloud Atlas, Julius exits the car.

1960
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,060
Cal is just like weeping.

1961
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,040
Julius is crying too.

1962
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,560
Beck just says to himself,

1963
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,260
God, I hope he's right about this.

1964
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,820
Luke, Julius Summers takes the Uber back

1965
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:27,380
to the city action news station.

1966
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,920
You get out and you head in

1967
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,360
over that marbled, marvelous floor, head upstairs.

1968
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,040
As you make your way upstairs,

1969
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,920
you see the door to your Uncle Ty Frailand's office

1970
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,720
is closed and you hear whistling

1971
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,520
coming from the other side.

1972
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,520
When you make it to the door,

1973
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,040
and when you open up the door,

1974
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,940
you see standing behind his desk, your Uncle Ty Frailand.

1975
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:08,260
And sitting at the two chairs facing Ty's desk,

1976
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:13,260
looking back toward you is a tall, mousy police officer

1977
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,500
wearing glasses and a short, jacked, bald police officer.

1978
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,160
Two whole new characters.

1979
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,460
And you recognize who?

1980
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,740
Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.

1981
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:28,900
That's right.

1982
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,500
Confidently, he says.

1983
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,220
And how does Julius feel in this moment?

1984
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,420
Disappointed in himself,

1985
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:40,420
yet excited at the prospect of a promotion.

1986
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,560
Nice.

1987
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,180
Thomas, Joe, Beck Wilder in Cal, Colorado,

1988
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,100
head the dream team, if you will,

1989
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:59,100
to the Natcher Hole in Cal, Colorado's Mercedes C-Class.

1990
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,300
And when you pull up-

1991
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,500
This is the start of some PTPB erotic fan fiction.

1992
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,500
Oh my God.

1993
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,140
It is straight for the natural.

1994
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,680
When we go to the northeast corner.

1995
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,800
When you head to the northeast corner,

1996
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,660
you see that there is a subway station there.

1997
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:23,280
And from the car, you see walking up

1998
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,740
out of this subway station at just this moment,

1999
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:31,740
with a wall of dark hair flowing down

2000
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:36,060
over their eyes, covering their nose,

2001
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:40,660
only showing their bottom black lip pierced with a hoop.

2002
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:46,980
SG, Stevie Godel.

2003
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,540
Son of a bitch, Beck.

2004
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,380
Holy shit, it's Stevie.

2005
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,580
Cal leans out the window and hawks a horn and goes,

2006
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:53,780
Hi Stevie.

2007
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,460
Beck is waving to you.

2008
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,300
Over here.

2009
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,700
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, it's us.

2010
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:03,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2011
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,540
It's great, and it's all my fault.

2012
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:12,760
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

2013
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,500
Cause my life is great.

2014
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,340
What I meant to say was actually,

2015
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,020
I feel so seen right now.

2016
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:38,100
Cal looks up, and crosses himself and points up.

2017
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,460
Sammy Sosa.

2018
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,380
Sammy Sosa.

2019
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,220
What?

2020
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,120
Nothing.

2021
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,960
And it's all my fault.

2022
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,120
It's all my fault.
