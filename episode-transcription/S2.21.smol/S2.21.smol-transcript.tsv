0	2000	Well, well, well.
2000	5440	Hello all my beautiful babies.
5440	8600	It's your spectral guardian, Wolf the Dog,
8600	14840	the DJ at the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.
14840	18120	Let's not dilly-dally and go ahead and jump
18120	21240	into everyone's favorite part of the show.
21240	24520	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Sam Witch,
24520	27720	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
27760	32080	A thing you should do, lest your blessed internet guests
32080	35400	guess that your zest for ingesting my jests
35400	37680	has been wrested from your chest.
37680	39480	But I digress.
39480	41560	Sam Witch writes,
41560	45000	Wolf the Dog, I have followed every instruction
45000	47520	you've given to the letterer every week,
47520	50400	telling those that would be to my left and to my right
50400	55960	to keep the radio dial tuned to 694.2 PTBP,
56040	58960	despite there being none other than me
58960	61480	in this near featureless void.
61480	65080	You, Wolf the Dog, are the only exception
65080	68440	to the otherwise unending monotony.
68440	72360	Thus to you I plead, please, Wolf the Dog,
72360	76280	be my lifeline back to the extensive library
76280	79080	that led me here with its yellowed pages
79080	82520	and please be quiet signs.
83440	87480	No, that's okay, Sam Witch.
87480	90240	I don't think I have time to do
90240	93040	whatever it is you just asked me to do,
93040	96320	but have fun whenever and wherever you are.
96320	98200	Ta-ta for now.
98200	101720	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,
101720	105240	come on, say it with me in your brain space.
105240	108840	Tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram
108840	111800	and tag pretending to be people on Facebook
111840	113640	or write up a five star review
113640	116160	on the podcast app of your choice
116160	119680	and make sure the proof comes across my desk.
119680	124080	Oh, and by the way, I heard what y'all did.
124080	127680	I heard y'all raised almost 800 bucks
127680	130520	and I heard those nasty boys
130520	133880	from pretending to be people rounded up, matched it
133880	137680	and sent a total of $1,600
137680	139880	to the crisis cold weather shelter
139880	144880	in their hometown of Springfield, Missouri.
144880	149000	Damn y'all, what a good job y'all did.
149000	153640	My producer's eye caverns have filled with salty water
153640	156800	because of the good y'all helped us spread
156800	160560	and no matter what kind of water fills your holes,
160560	163600	there's always the news.
163600	166840	Last time, Cal reached out to his contact
166840	169680	in the city PD, Chief McMillan,
170360	174000	to find out more information about the un-uniformed gobs
174000	178000	that stole footage from Vivica at the Cannes station.
178000	183000	The two officers showed up in CPD cruiser number 836
183600	187080	and Chief Mac used cop net to identify them
187080	191320	as officer Richard Riley and officer Wilson Wiley.
191320	195160	Tithe Rayland texted his employee and nephew,
195160	198160	Julius Summers and asked him to come back
198200	202480	to the Cannes station soon to meet in Tithe's office
202480	204720	and to bring Beck and Cal.
204720	209120	After a quick stop at Riley and Wiley's local drinking hole,
209120	213240	which is of course called W-A-R-E-R-We,
213240	216640	we're at Bucky's Kids Bar, duh,
216640	220460	the Cannes crew was able to bribe the night manager
220460	223120	for Riley and Wiley's addresses.
223120	226960	But at that same moment, Tithe texted again,
226960	229440	more impatient this time,
229440	233240	requesting the team's presence in his office.
233240	237520	Speaking of presence, here's a true gift,
237520	242240	a brand new tune, just for you my favorite listener,
242240	244360	my widdle baby.
244360	247500	Shh, don't tell anyone else now,
247500	252500	it's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
253140	257140	And it's all my fault
257140	262140	Cause my life is great
262140	264140	And it's all mine
271500	276500	Cause my life is great
276500	279500	And it's all my fault
282500	287500	And it's all my fault
290100	292420	Hey Luke, who was your favorite teacher?
292420	296420	My favorite teacher, probably Jesus.
296420	297860	Joe, write that down.
297860	298740	Jesus?
298740	301620	My first pet named after my favorite teacher.
301620	302780	Jesus, Jesus, okay.
302780	304020	The street you grew up on?
304020	309020	Uh, oh crap, I was trying to think of like a-
309300	312620	Golgotha, Jesus.
312620	315420	I don't know enough about the Bible to have made a joke.
315420	317500	That's the hill that he was crucified on.
317500	318940	That's the hill he died on.
320940	323220	And he stayed dead.
323220	324740	Dude, I was laughing the other day.
324740	329740	Actually, there's some debate on that last point.
330500	334300	I saw somebody be like, I saw somebody online be like,
334300	336460	I was online, somebody was like,
336460	338540	so wait, he came back from the dead,
338980	340340	so he didn't die for our sins,
340340	342780	he like took a weekend off for our sins.
344660	346780	I'm not really familiar with the text, but he's like-
346780	348660	He died, he went to hell.
348660	350980	I don't ask me why he went to hell.
350980	352820	He stole the gates.
352820	354700	No, not the gates, that would be too much.
354700	356380	He stole the keys to the gates of hell.
356380	357780	It would be too much for him to carry.
357780	358620	Far too much.
362180	364900	Luke, this doesn't sound made up, hear him out.
366140	367660	So he goes to hell.
367660	369060	It does sound like a set up for a joke.
369060	371660	Okay, so Jesus dies, he goes to hell.
371660	372700	He steals the keys, not the gates.
372700	374340	It sounds like a good-ass comic book.
374340	376460	I get why all those people tried to turn the Bible
376460	377280	into a comic.
377280	378620	Yeah, from hell.
378620	381700	Yeah, Alan Moore's adaptation.
382620	383460	I want that-
383460	385580	Wait, so did Jesus really go to hell?
385580	390020	There are many eye witnesses to-
392780	395140	There are many sex knights of Christianity
395140	398340	who do believe that Jesus went to hell and stole the keys.
398340	402380	And so they just made that up and they say it
402380	403220	and that's what they believe.
403220	404540	So you worship a thief?
405500	406660	Wow.
406660	410260	I believe they say multiple times that Jesus will come back
410260	412940	like a thief in the night for his followers.
412940	414580	I want that shirt that says,
414580	417020	if Jesus comes back, we'll kill him again.
418780	421220	I want Jesus to come on my back like a thief in the night.
421220	422700	Is this an ad for Roman?
422700	424620	Did I show you guys the shirt that I bought
424620	426320	based on an Instagram ad?
426320	427700	Yes, you did.
427700	429540	I cannot wait to get that one.
429540	431740	Do you want to tell people what it is?
431740	435160	It's like a weird green monster guy on the phone
435160	436500	kind of like kicking back.
436500	438460	And it says, if you don't like my attitude,
438460	440980	call 1-800-EAT-SHIT.
442340	444740	Were you gonna wear that to the Christmas
444740	445780	you can't go to?
445780	449380	I was hoping that I could.
449380	451180	Now I'll just have to wear it to a client meeting.
451180	452780	No, just have to wear it, yeah.
453780	455540	On the family Zoom call.
455540	456580	No, it's not Christmas time.
456580	458340	It's January, mid January.
458340	461320	How's sober January going for you guys?
461320	462160	What's that?
464540	466660	It's December, but I already stopped mine.
466660	470020	I don't decide what my new year's resolution
470020	474380	is gonna be until, you know, usually January 3rd, so.
474380	476580	Mine's jerk off every day.
476580	478300	How are you doing this year?
478300	479500	In 2022.
479500	481260	It's the same one every year.
481260	483220	Yeah, you're down six days from 365,
483220	484980	so we're rocking 359.
484980	486680	How many times have you KO'd?
486680	488460	Wait, say the first part again.
488460	492740	Well, there's probably been around 358, 359 days this year.
492740	495340	I would say maybe not every day,
495340	499280	but at least enough to average one a day.
502820	504900	Couple Tuesdays pulling some heavy weight there.
504900	507040	Yeah, a couple Threesdays and Foursdays.
511260	515620	Thomas, how many times a day do you jerk off?
515620	516540	Average.
516540	517500	Average.
520300	521140	Or weird.
521140	522300	Yeah, at least.
524500	525640	I'm gonna say my-
525640	527940	No, no, no, say the number that makes you feel weird
527940	528860	in a day.
528860	530420	I haven't found that number yet.
532660	534540	I'm proud of each and every one of them.
534540	536540	No, no, no, by weird I mean lightheaded.
538260	539740	The limit does not exist.
541260	542100	Yeah.
548740	550620	One of my favorite Christmas movies.
551540	552660	Oh my goodness.
552660	553500	Die hard.
554380	556620	Have you guys watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas movie?
556620	557460	I did, yes.
557460	558540	Was it bad?
558540	559380	Top notch.
559380	562460	Like recommend or like it's fine that you watched it?
562460	564180	On my belt.
564180	565020	On my belt?
565020	567420	Yeah, I had to notch it all the way up.
568680	569520	Real tight.
569520	570940	Did you really watch it?
571500	572340	Yeah, I did watch it.
572340	573180	It was on at my house.
573180	574980	I didn't put it on.
574980	576060	Probably your dumb wife.
576060	579180	My dumb, I couldn't even say it.
579180	582220	Taylor, my extremely intelligent and compassionate wife.
585240	586320	Who does dumb shit?
588900	590800	I think it was either her or Lindsay,
590800	593460	another one of our guests here at Pretending to be People.
593460	594700	Another one of my wives.
597700	599800	They put it on when we were hanging out
599800	601760	and then I think they hung out
601760	604800	and I watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas film.
604800	608440	Is it like, I've been told it's like Hallmark vibes.
608440	610360	It very much is a Hallmark movie.
610360	612160	It's just on Netflix, yeah.
612160	614280	She bonks her head, forgets who she is.
614280	615800	The guy that she falls in love with
615800	617660	is technically taking advantage of her
617660	619820	because she knows how much money she's worth.
619820	621200	When you say technically,
621200	623040	do you mean he still actually really loves her?
623040	624680	Oh, defo.
624680	627700	I saw one on Peacock called Love on Rye
627700	631900	and this Jewish matchmaker sets these two people up
631900	634660	and then the drama is that they find out
634660	637620	that they operate competing delis.
638900	640300	And that is not made up.
642860	644920	Wait, is this a non-fiction or fiction?
644920	645760	TBD.
647500	649540	I think he's asking is it reality or?
649540	650780	That is what I was asking.
650780	651620	And that's what I was answering.
651620	653620	That's historical fiction is what Luke means.
653620	655180	Based on a true story probably.
655180	656900	Yeah, Argo style.
656940	658940	Sounds like it's based on You've Got Mail.
661140	662980	It's called Hanukkah on Rye.
662980	663980	What did you say it was?
663980	664860	Love on Rye?
664860	667620	Yeah, I was wondering if that was like a play on words
667620	668580	for something.
668580	669420	Well.
669420	670900	Let's dive into this motherfucker.
670900	671720	Let's do it.
671720	672560	Dive on in.
672560	674660	Let's do a bit of a dive in then.
674660	675500	Dive.
675500	678220	Let's do a dive into the pool.
678220	680900	Hey, remember what we said earlier about Scottish accents.
680900	684000	Oh, I said I was gonna do a dive into the pool.
687580	689740	Yeah, there you go.
689740	691540	As long as you're respectful.
691540	693980	It's deeper than four feet gonna do.
693980	695260	What's four feet?
695260	698180	Don't you mean a meter and a half?
700660	702940	Oh, this pool is about a fortnight deep.
702940	704660	Bet I can dive in here.
706700	708100	Dive on in.
708100	713100	You guys were on our way to talk to one of the
713220	715660	Richard or Wylie?
715660	716820	Or say their names.
717660	719460	Richard Wylie and William Wylie.
719460	720500	Wilson Wylie.
720500	721660	Nice.
721660	726380	Wilson or Richard and we've got a date with Uncle Tife.
726380	727700	You do have a date with Uncle Tife.
727700	731200	You've been out and about today going from place to place.
731200	734320	I believe you started over at Vivica's apartment,
734320	736860	headed on back to the can station,
736860	739940	which then led you out to a bar.
739940	741080	What was the bar called?
741080	743700	There was a little stop off there in between those
743700	746500	down at the park to visit an old friend of Cal's.
747060	747900	That's right.
749220	751860	An eloquent, well-spoken gentleman.
751860	753100	An articulate gentleman.
754460	756820	And he gave you the names of the...
756820	757660	He gave the names.
757660	759660	He gave us the names and he also said that
759660	764660	15 to 25% of his force were not cops, but gops.
764840	766460	Cops on the Godel payroll.
767620	770760	Which led us to, where are we?
770760	773460	Spelled W-A-R-E in the dare font.
773460	775740	We're at Bucky Kid's bar.
775780	776620	Duh.
778140	780580	Where we spoke to Bucky Kid's kid.
780580	781420	That's right.
781420	784300	Who pointed us to Lulu, the night manager.
784300	785140	L-E-A-U-X.
785140	785980	Lolo.
785980	786800	L-E-A-X.
786800	787640	Is it Lolo?
787640	788700	It's Lolo.
788700	789820	Pardon me.
789820	792220	He pointed us towards Lolo, the night manager
792220	796900	of where are we, we're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh.
796900	799600	Which started out, no one liked that.
802140	804240	And I think it grew on us a little bit.
805160	807680	I'm fine with it, as long as you're the one
807680	809280	who remembers how to say it.
811420	814480	It's like Wawa KBD, right?
814480	816600	Or B-K-B.
816600	818000	Wawa book-ba.
818000	819580	I don't know any of the stuff you just said.
819580	820420	Where are we?
820420	823280	We're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh.
823280	827720	Wawa book-ba-da is what they call it for short.
827720	829820	Easily remembered.
829820	832040	Anyway, then we called Lolo.
832040	834400	He hooked us up with a couple addresses.
834400	836500	After Cal.
836500	837600	Called him.
837600	838440	And.
838440	839540	Tricked him.
839540	840380	And.
841600	842680	Didn't trick him so much.
842680	843520	Fin modem?
843520	844520	Fin modem.
844520	847980	Yes, sometimes you must grease the palms of truth.
847980	851760	And then I think we took off towards one of the addresses.
851760	854080	We benevolently said whichever's close to us,
854080	856600	so you can give us the character you want us to meet first.
856600	859960	And on the way there, Tife texted Julius,
859960	861880	said, hey, get here soon,
861880	864040	but we got a date for 45 minutes.
864040	865840	Yeah, and what are we supposed to meet Tife about?
865840	867120	I don't think we know, I think he just.
867120	869240	He just said he wants to talk to us.
869240	872480	Yeah, and I mean, you went into the office for a little bit.
872480	874520	You didn't talk to Tife.
874520	875680	He hasn't seen you around.
875680	877120	It's been a minute since you've seen Tife,
877120	879400	so he's probably just curious.
879400	881600	Didn't we tell him, though, that we were trying,
881600	882720	that we didn't have the footage
882720	884000	and we were trying to get the footage back?
884000	886680	He at least knows what we're out and about doing, I think.
886680	888400	Zach said he's probably just curious,
888400	889840	so it's.
889840	891280	I told him I was working out,
891280	893800	that's why I couldn't meet with him then.
893800	896640	It's like, I gotta see my cousin's hot gym bod.
896640	899520	I don't know if we did, did we tell him about the footage?
899520	900360	I don't know if we did.
900360	901720	I feel like we did, I feel like we told him
901720	904640	that that's why we didn't wanna meet him right away,
904640	906160	is that we were trying to get it back.
906160	907040	Didn't we say that to him?
907040	908680	I told him I was working out.
908680	910760	You knew that you didn't trust him.
910760	911760	I don't think we told him.
911760	915240	Okay, I thought we did, but it doesn't matter either way.
915240	916560	He'll ask us where it is if we get there.
916560	919840	In that moment, two possible realities were created.
922240	925600	So we'll be playing two different stories
925600	926800	from here on out coming out
926800	928520	on still the biweekly schedule.
928520	930480	It might get a little wild.
930480	933240	And who knows, maybe we'll go back and forward in time.
933240	934280	Oh, god.
934280	935360	Oh, timey-wimey?
935360	936360	Oh, timey-wimey.
936360	938160	If you're gonna spend any amount of time
938160	941040	at Richard Riley or Wilson Wiley's home,
941040	943080	you're not going to be able to visit there
943080	945360	and make it back to the can station
945400	947000	in time for the meeting with Tyfe.
947000	948840	So you have a choice at this point.
948840	951000	You can either show up early for the meeting
951000	953320	or you can go to one of these homes
953320	955640	and then show up late to the meeting.
955640	956480	What was the urgency
956480	958200	in getting to these places right now?
958200	959240	To get our footage back.
959240	961320	Yeah, we were trying not to show up empty-handed at least.
961320	963800	Yeah, have the footage when we go to work.
963800	967120	I think we were pretty heavily headed in the direction
967120	969560	of talking to one of them before we go to the meeting.
969560	970400	Yeah, I think so too.
970400	971600	I just don't know.
971600	974480	Joe doesn't know what we're gonna do
974520	976600	when we get to one of these places.
976600	977480	Looking at these names,
977480	980160	I wonder if he had a voice plan for Richard Riley
980160	981680	and then he's just gonna do it again
981680	984440	with like a lisp for Wilson Wiley.
986600	988240	It seems like his style.
988240	989680	Don't call me out like that.
991400	994940	Guys, we're supposed to meet with Tyfe in 45 minutes,
994940	998640	but I think I can hold him off if we're a little late.
998640	1000160	Let's go to Wilson Wiley's.
1000840	1001680	Brrrrrr.
1001680	1003520	Arghhh.
1003520	1005080	Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
1005080	1006020	Beep beep.
1006020	1007840	Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
1007840	1009740	Watch you crazy motherfucker.
1009740	1010820	Ahhh-ooh-ha.
1012820	1016400	You are in the downtown area.
1016400	1021400	The apartment for Wilson Wiley is in a nice tall...
1023280	1024360	Yeah, do you like that?
1024360	1025800	What's this neighborhood called?
1025800	1028280	Oh, the downtown area.
1028280	1029640	Hahaha.
1029640	1033360	It's a hot July day, midday, rolling into downtown,
1033360	1036520	skyscrapers towering on either side of you.
1036520	1041520	You continue in Cal Colorado's beautiful Mercedes C-Class
1042000	1044640	with a, what was it?
1044640	1048820	A red siren on top with Bluetooth speakers,
1048820	1052600	and Julius is in the back watching Cloud Atlas.
1052600	1053440	Hahahaha.
1055360	1059160	If he had his earbuds out, he would hear Cal Colorado
1059600	1061240	talking loudly over the radio and saying,
1061240	1062200	do you like this Beck?
1062200	1064080	It's the Blues Brothers soundtrack.
1064080	1065120	Yeah, man, it's...
1065120	1067200	Well, Blues Brothers 2000.
1067200	1069440	Oh, yeah, I was gonna say it's a classic,
1069440	1071480	and that's, I mean, it's got its things too.
1071480	1072320	Yeah.
1072320	1073140	Yeah.
1073140	1073980	No, that's a good one, yeah.
1073980	1075040	I like it.
1075040	1076200	It's good, yeah.
1076200	1077360	Is Rubber Biscuit on that one?
1077360	1079760	Oh, no, that's on the first one.
1079760	1080900	Oh, yeah, okay.
1082520	1083900	Yeah, yeah.
1083900	1086680	I mean, they do a really, really energetic cover
1086680	1088040	of funky Nassau.
1088040	1089000	All right, yeah.
1089760	1090600	I can get into it.
1090600	1091440	That's kind of at the end, though,
1091440	1094160	where it's, I don't think we'll get to it on this trip.
1094160	1095000	Okay.
1095000	1097080	You should really experience it in order.
1097080	1098160	Did we start at one?
1098160	1099000	Yeah, yeah.
1099000	1101200	Or is this where you left off last time you were in here?
1101200	1102320	We're on two.
1102320	1104960	Listen, after we finish, we'll watch the movie together.
1104960	1105860	No, I've seen it.
1105860	1107280	Wait, hook?
1107280	1108100	Hook.
1108100	1108940	Hahahaha.
1111560	1114960	Julius pauses the movie and takes his earbuds out,
1114960	1118040	and it's kind of like looking very inspired.
1118080	1121000	What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?
1121000	1123400	And then they pull up to Wylie's house.
1124300	1125160	Which is an apartment.
1125160	1127860	Oh, beautiful da, downtown area,
1127860	1129920	but that's what they're calling it.
1131920	1133040	I thought that park got cut.
1133040	1134240	Yeah, probably did.
1134240	1139240	So you guys pull into a underground parking lot
1139240	1144240	for an apartment building in the downtown area?
1144260	1145100	Da.
1145100	1145920	Da da.
1145960	1148680	And it's like really nice.
1148680	1151960	This is suspiciously nice for a cop.
1151960	1154680	I think we're dealing with a cop here.
1154680	1155520	Indeed.
1155520	1157480	There's plenty of visitor parking
1157480	1161240	and an elevator that leads you up into the building.
1161240	1162560	His apartment's on the eighth floor.
1162560	1165240	Just want to point out that we made our way downtown.
1165240	1166080	Hahahaha.
1167200	1169560	Making our way to the downtown area.
1169560	1170680	Driving fast.
1170680	1172680	Looking for Wilson Wylie.
1172680	1174520	And now I'm in the dock.
1174520	1176240	We've got Cloud Atlas.
1176240	1177840	Da na na na na na na na na.
1177840	1178680	On the DVD.
1178680	1180560	Da na na na na na na na.
1180560	1182400	Funky Nassau.
1182400	1183240	And Tom Hanks.
1183240	1184400	Funky Nassau.
1184400	1185900	And Oprah.
1185900	1186740	Was she in that?
1186740	1187800	She's thinking of the color purple.
1187800	1188640	Dammit.
1188640	1190040	What do you think Cloud Atlas is?
1190040	1190880	Hahahaha.
1192040	1193960	Tell me right now.
1193960	1195600	First thoughts.
1195600	1198920	I'm picturing looks like Lake Tahoe.
1198920	1199760	Nailed it.
1201220	1202520	Unfortunately not.
1202520	1203960	That's a really good guess.
1205520	1208280	That's a good stab in the dark for any particular,
1208280	1209320	like I don't know what that is,
1209320	1210840	but that's not Cloud Atlas.
1210840	1212880	About a map maker who lives in...
1212880	1214480	That's closer.
1214480	1216040	Okay, a map maker?
1216040	1217560	No, but like a...
1217560	1219440	So you guys get out of the C class
1219440	1221840	and head over to the elevator.
1221840	1225720	There's a doorman who's actually stationed down
1225720	1228560	in the parking area and he greets you
1228560	1229500	and he's just like...
1229500	1230340	Eighth floor?
1230340	1231160	Eighth floor.
1231160	1232120	Yeah, of course.
1232200	1234600	And he clicks the up button on the elevator.
1234600	1235800	Who are you going to visit?
1235800	1237280	Oh, just an old friend.
1237280	1238340	What is your name, sir?
1238340	1239240	Dave.
1239240	1241220	Dave, I'm Cal Colorado.
1241220	1242560	City Action News.
1242560	1244320	Whoa, that's right.
1244320	1246080	I knew you looked familiar.
1246080	1247400	How are you doing today, Dave?
1247400	1249260	Wow, better now, sir.
1250440	1251720	Got any news for me?
1251720	1254240	Well, well, we might.
1254240	1255520	Let me just say we might.
1255520	1256360	Hm hm hm hm hm hm.
1256360	1258760	But that's not what we're doing here today.
1258760	1260840	Again, this is just an old family friend
1260840	1261800	we're checking up on.
1262320	1264720	Well, of course, you all have a lovely day.
1264720	1265700	You too, Dave.
1265700	1268760	I stay waving until I'm sure the elevator doors have closed
1268760	1269640	and he's gone down.
1269640	1271320	The elevator doors have closed.
1271320	1272160	You are going up.
1272160	1273920	He has stayed in the same spot.
1273920	1275960	Oh, I thought he was on the elevator with us.
1275960	1277120	He decided not to ride.
1277120	1279360	No, he was on the outside of the elevator.
1279360	1280200	He's in the...
1280200	1281680	I thought he was in it with us also.
1284320	1286720	Oh, then I guess he's in the elevator.
1286720	1287720	Eighth floor, huh?
1287720	1288560	Yeah, I thought we...
1288560	1290360	I'm not so much an elevator attendant
1290360	1291920	as a parking garage kind of guy.
1291920	1293520	There's a way to make this work in the edit
1293520	1295080	without us saying anything else.
1295080	1295920	Hahaha.
1297680	1300600	As the doors open to the eighth floor,
1300600	1303080	you see a beautiful carpet.
1303080	1306980	It's got scenes of the jungle on it.
1306980	1309280	So there's lots of different plant life
1309280	1312120	and animals kind of drawn into it.
1312120	1313760	And the scene's kind of carpet
1313760	1315440	like at the Springfield airport.
1315440	1317600	I'm thinking Zach just watched the intro
1317600	1319120	to season one of White Lotus.
1319440	1322440	I just watched season one of White Lotus last year.
1322440	1323980	It was really good.
1323980	1325040	Was there animals?
1325040	1326280	I don't remember.
1326280	1328560	Yeah, the intro is just images
1328560	1330120	of everything Zach just described.
1330120	1330960	Okay, so it's that.
1330960	1332920	It's the White Lotus season one intro.
1334040	1335680	It was the carpet that you used for that intro.
1335680	1336520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1336520	1337680	Well, I was just thinking about it.
1337680	1338520	Hahaha.
1340440	1341280	And there's...
1341280	1342680	You can support the podcast on Patreon
1342680	1344660	if you want more content like this.
1344660	1347100	There's sconces on the walls
1347100	1348980	in between each of these doors
1349820	1351500	that are considerably far apart.
1351500	1352780	So like White Lotus 2.
1354420	1355260	The sequel.
1357100	1358500	The sconce is in.
1359940	1364380	Okay guys, we need to find apartment 80085.
1364380	1366180	I bet it's going to be 836.
1366180	1369060	Well, let's check the text message and see.
1369060	1371340	When you go to the text, guess what it is?
1371340	1372180	836.
1372180	1373380	It's boobs.
1373380	1375220	It's boobs.
1375220	1377580	Yeah, it's apartment 836.
1378020	1379100	What are we going to say to him?
1379100	1381020	Cal bangs on the door.
1381020	1384820	Cal Colorado, give me back my footage you son of a bitch.
1384820	1385660	Hello?
1386620	1387460	Oh fuck.
1387460	1391060	Julius's legs tense, ready for action.
1391060	1393180	On the other side of the door, you hear a small voice.
1393180	1396060	Hello, this is a nice newsman.
1396060	1396900	Hello.
1396900	1398380	Is your daddy here?
1398380	1399220	No.
1399220	1400280	Perfect, open up.
1402420	1405220	Cal like winces, but doesn't correct him.
1405220	1406060	Doesn't like.
1406100	1406940	Roll persuade.
1409020	1411300	30 pass on a 60.
1411300	1413980	This little girl succeeded as well
1413980	1416300	with a higher roll, the 47.
1416300	1420180	She says, I'm not supposed to let in any strangers.
1420180	1421860	Oh, of course not.
1421860	1423860	But I'm no stranger.
1423860	1426780	I'm Cal Colorado from the news.
1426780	1428100	You've probably seen me.
1428100	1430100	Oh man, this candy bar is super good.
1430100	1431740	I wish I had somebody to share it with.
1431740	1432580	Oh my God.
1432580	1437580	You sound like you've done this before.
1440540	1442740	You're gonna have to learn the enemy, you know?
1442740	1444820	Any horrible thoughts from Becker now?
1446660	1447820	No, he's just filming.
1454260	1456040	Such as horrible deeds.
1458860	1460180	Cal, if you wanna go ahead and roll.
1460180	1461620	Yeah, I'll roll.
1461620	1463180	That's a 67 on an 80.
1463180	1465840	Yeah, she passed as well, but only with a 30.
1465840	1468500	Cal Colorado from a TV?
1468500	1470740	That's right, I'm from your TV, sweetie.
1470740	1472580	Wow.
1472580	1476420	And the door unlocks and then the door slowly opens
1476420	1480860	and you see just the most adorable little six year old
1480860	1483060	on the other side staring up at you.
1483060	1484500	Cal turns back to you guys
1484500	1487220	and like gives you a very like pained look
1487220	1489860	and then turns back to her with a huge smile

1516060	1517500	Tressa, does Tressa know

1525020	1529740	The work things, I only know about where those are
1529740	1532500	if you can feed me.
1532500	1535420	Oh, it seems that Tressa is hungry.
1535420	1537380	Pass the candy bar over Julius.
1537380	1538860	Julius was lying.
1542500	1544420	You've got a six year old holding up a little
1544420	1546260	like miniature horse at you.
1546260	1547380	Julius feed the horse.
1547380	1548300	Beck, check your pockets.
1548340	1550780	Beck definitely has candy bars in his pockets.
1552140	1553100	He pulls one out.
1553940	1557540	Here's one for, was it Sandal or Tressa
1557540	1558380	that was so hungry?
1558380	1560380	Tressa, Tressa.
1560380	1562060	Here you go Tressa.
1562060	1564380	And I kind of am shoving the candy bar
1564380	1565820	against the horse's mouth.
1565820	1567940	Oh, it looks like she likes that.
1567940	1569340	It's an oat candy bar.
1569340	1571740	Someone roll like 50, 50 up and down.
1574180	1576260	Who's leaving a six year old home alone?
1577260	1578460	45.
1578460	1579740	That's good.
1579740	1580580	That's good.
1580580	1581700	These neglectful parents.
1581700	1584780	You think that you hear a sound coming from
1584780	1587220	like the bathroom or something, but.
1587220	1588300	Then a cat hops out.
1588300	1589140	Nice.
1590780	1592740	Oh, Tressa's so hungry.
1595540	1597140	Julius, while this is happening,
1597140	1599380	is gonna do a quick once over of the.
1599380	1600500	Yeah, everybody, yeah.
1600500	1601340	Yeah.
1601340	1602340	Actually nods off.
1602340	1603180	Roll search.
1604020	1607380	31 on a 70.
1607380	1609380	Okay, hit me with what you're looking for.
1609380	1610620	Our footage, you son of a bitch.
1610620	1614020	Yeah, any sort of tech looking stuff
1614020	1617660	or anything that would, or like a safe or something.
1617660	1618780	Yeah, Cal passes too.
1618780	1620380	He's like, and tell me this one's name.
1620380	1622420	But he's like looking behind her shoulder
1622420	1623900	like all over the room.
1623900	1625180	This one's Dango.
1625180	1626020	Dango.
1626020	1626860	Dango.
1626860	1628380	How'd you come up with that name?
1628380	1629220	I said it.
1633300	1635020	What a ham.
1635020	1637100	You would do very well on the news, young lady.
1637100	1638820	She immediately runs away
1638820	1641220	and is digging through toys.
1641220	1643700	Hey, remember Tressa was gonna show us
1643700	1645860	where your daddy keeps his work banks?
1645860	1648580	This one's a ham pulls out a pig.
1648580	1650540	Oh, oh, smashing.
1650540	1651980	That's what you do with a pig bank.
1651980	1653460	Did Julius find anything?
1653460	1656500	Yes, you found a safe.
1656500	1657700	Big, small.
1657700	1661780	Yes, it is a medium sized safe.
1661780	1663260	It's a Goldilocks safe.
1663260	1668260	It is in the back bedroom is the master bedroom closet.
1669020	1671780	There is a average size safe back there.
1671780	1674260	Julius is gonna try 88, five.
1675580	1676820	It does not work.
1676820	1679780	Julius, what if you tried eight, three, six?
1679780	1681220	He tries eight, three, six.
1681220	1683180	Go ahead and roll luck.
1683180	1684980	If you create, I'll give it to you.
1686460	1687820	Oh my God though.
1687820	1688980	It was a 23.
1688980	1689820	Yeah.
1690820	1692860	Like the number movie.
1692860	1694100	Like the number movie.
1694100	1696220	Does Julius start seeing numbers?
1696220	1698060	Wait, yeah, actually.
1698060	1700100	Just like the time I crashed my Scion TC.
1702100	1703500	Why are you trying eight, three, six?
1703500	1705660	There's just like a subliminal vibe in here.
1705660	1706500	Yeah.
1706500	1707340	Like it just kind of feels like.
1707340	1708180	God told them to.
1708180	1709100	Because it's the apartment number.
1709100	1709920	That's a good reason.
1709920	1710760	That's fine.
1710760	1712500	But it was boobs was the apartment number, right?
1714300	1716540	Oh, right, right, try boobs.
1716540	1718780	I did already, it didn't work.
1718780	1722500	You also see a spot on the desk where there was a laptop,
1722500	1725500	but there is currently not a laptop
1725500	1729460	and it seems like the charger is pulled up in that spot
1729460	1731100	and there's like a clip for it
1731100	1732700	and the mouse and mouse pad are there,
1732700	1735940	but there's no laptop sitting in the empty spot on the desk.
1735940	1737460	What was the kid's name?
1737460	1738300	What?
1738300	1739120	You know what?
1739120	1740460	You've told us your horsey's names.
1740460	1741300	Yeah.
1741300	1742120	And the pig's name.
1742120	1742960	What is your name?
1742960	1743800	Oh, my name?
1743800	1745580	Way-chill.
1745580	1747160	Well, Way-chill.
1747160	1748420	No, it's Way-chill.
1748940	1749780	Oh, Rachel.
1749780	1750620	That's right.
1750620	1751440	I have a cousin named Rachel.
1751440	1752540	She's smart like you.
1752540	1753380	She smiles.
1754460	1756900	Do you get left alone here very often?
1756900	1757720	No.
1757720	1758560	No?
1758560	1760460	How long ago did your parents step out?
1760460	1762260	She's just like playing with toys
1762260	1766140	and she's like, mom went down to go get some groceries
1766140	1769340	to finish up the meal and you look over
1769340	1771540	and there's like some things have been pulled out
1771540	1774900	of the fridge and like no chopping has started,
1774900	1777820	but it seems like meal prep is about to begin.
1778100	1780380	Oh, I bet that looks like a good lunch.
1780380	1783180	I think you probably have a good mom
1783180	1785540	who feeds you good nutritious food.
1785540	1787400	I'm sure your dad cares about that too.
1787400	1789620	What time would you say he left for work?
1789620	1792900	Oh, I don't see my daddy very much.
1792900	1793740	Oh.
1793740	1795060	Julius pops his head out.
1795060	1796500	Had a dad like that too.
1796500	1797740	Oh, yeah.
1797740	1800140	Remind me again when your birthday is.
1800140	1801700	Oh, my birthday?
1801700	1802540	Uh-huh.
1802540	1803660	August 3rd?
1803660	1804780	Of what year?
1804780	1805600	What?
1805600	1806440	How old are you?
1806440	1807460	The year you were born.
1807980	1808820	I'm this many.
1808820	1809780	Six, Julius.
1809780	1813940	Julius deducts six from the year that it is currently.
1813940	1815060	It's 2022.
1815060	1818220	He tries, yeah, I'm not doing that math.
1818220	1822220	It's like 1980, what am I, Stephen Hawking?
1823180	1828180	Julius tries eight, three, you said six years old?
1828220	1830700	We already did eight, three, six, we already.
1830700	1832620	Well, not, yeah, but.
1832620	1834460	This time I did it because August 3rd
1834460	1835900	and she's six years old.
1835900	1837340	Yeah, eight.
1837340	1841860	Well, not eight, three, six, but eight, three, six.
1841860	1842700	16.
1842700	1843520	Eight, three, 16.
1843520	1844360	Roll luck again.
1845620	1846900	90 is good, right?
1848900	1850020	I liked them.
1850020	1851700	Julius is gonna kick the safe.
1851700	1852540	What was that?
1852540	1853360	Ow.
1853360	1854540	Oh, that's my friend Julius.
1854540	1855580	He's very clumsy.
1855580	1857140	Are any of these animals clumsy?
1857140	1858260	Oh, yeah.
1859500	1860320	Twain?
1860320	1861160	Twain.
1861160	1863220	Twain is very clumsy.
1863220	1865560	Yeah, Twain is always twipping.
1866420	1869060	It's okay to be clumsy sometimes.
1869060	1869900	Yeah.
1869900	1871380	Beck is leaning over to Cal.
1871380	1874440	Do you think that means that the name is Twain or Train?
1874440	1875820	I have no fucking idea.
1875820	1877900	Julius tries nine, one, one.
1881940	1884140	As you're going through the safe
1884140	1886020	and just like trying repeatedly
1886020	1888020	to open it with different random numbers,
1888020	1889740	you're not having a lot of luck.
1889740	1892060	But while this conversation is happening
1892060	1894420	with the child in the main room
1894420	1896420	and you're going through all this stuff
1896420	1898780	by the desk in this back room,
1898780	1903780	you see that underneath some folders
1903780	1906540	and there's some mail
1906540	1910220	and there's a handwritten piece of paper
1910220	1912180	shoved up in the middle of it.
1912180	1915740	And it says, I always keep the safe unlocked.
1919060	1921860	Julius, Julius, just try opening it.
1921860	1923540	It says it's always kept unlocked.
1923580	1924420	It's a safe.
1924420	1926540	It's meant to be hard to get into.
1926540	1927860	You can't just pass a search check
1927860	1928980	and get into a safe.
1928980	1930780	What does your paper say?
1930780	1931660	The paper.
1931660	1934500	It just says all that explaining that about safes.
1934500	1935340	It says.
1935340	1936160	That's safes.
1936160	1937000	As a role-playing mechanic.
1937000	1938180	As a reminder, safes.
1938180	1939020	Oh yeah.
1939020	1939860	Locking.
1939860	1940680	It should be difficult.
1940680	1942820	It should feel challenging but rewarding.
1943820	1945420	Over your players to open one.
1947460	1952460	It says S.G.Naturhole.
1953860	1958460	N-A-T-U-R capital H-O-L-E.
1958460	1961060	The Naturhole, which you all know
1961060	1965580	is an abandoned baseball stadium in the city.
1965580	1969860	It was abandoned because there was a sinkhole.
1969860	1971380	I forgot about this.
1972740	1974780	In the middle of the infield
1974780	1978700	that basically eliminated the entire playing area
1978700	1979700	within the stadium.
1979700	1981900	However, the stadium seating itself.
1981900	1983460	Well, plus the triple A team,
1983460	1984740	the contingent corndogs.
1984740	1985580	That's right.
1985580	1987420	Wait, no, they can't play there.
1987420	1988260	They were.
1988260	1989820	It's a movie theater now.
1989820	1990880	Exactly.
1990880	1994020	And it's a movie theater that we called.
1994020	1994860	The Naturhole.
1994860	1995680	The Naturhole.
1995680	1998060	Shout out to Thomas Cox, not a patron.
1998060	2002540	Just on our, in our session.
2002540	2003860	Just a friend of the podcast.
2003860	2008860	In our session zero that is yet to be released.
2008960	2011380	Our session zero part two for season two.
2011820	2013020	Unofficial collaborator.
2015300	2017980	We created the abandoned baseball park.
2017980	2019120	The Naturhole.
2019120	2019960	The Naturhole.
2019960	2020860	The Naturhole.
2020860	2022540	Currently the movie theater.
2023420	2025580	Specifically for large events.
2025580	2026420	The Naturhole.
2026420	2028620	Wasn't it like also three,
2028620	2031520	like all the walls were the screen?
2031520	2032360	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
2032360	2034100	It's like an omni-plex or whatever
2034100	2037120	where you like look down into this massive screen
2037120	2038220	and you like, yeah.
2038220	2040720	It sounds like a suboptimal viewing experience.
2041700	2043100	They're still figuring it out.
2045100	2046980	I bet that's cool for five minutes.
2046980	2051100	And then there underneath where it says SG Naturhole,
2051100	2053340	it has cross streets,
2053340	2057020	which are on like the Northeast side of the Naturhole.
2057020	2060300	And it says, follow down.
2060300	2062100	Julius grabs that piece of paper.
2062100	2063140	He's just looking at it.
2063140	2066620	He grabs it and goes out into the main area with them.
2066620	2068460	Guys, I think I've found a clue.
2068500	2072540	And he looks over at the like meal prep area.
2072540	2075220	I think we should get out of here and go to that meeting.
2075220	2076640	Beck agrees, Beck.
2076640	2077860	As soon as he heard her say
2077860	2079720	that she was just popping out for groceries,
2079720	2082580	he felt like we're on a time crunch.
2082580	2083800	Oh yeah, yeah.
2083800	2084860	If you feel like we were good here,
2084860	2087020	I think we should probably make ourselves scarce.
2087020	2087900	You look over at Beck
2087900	2089660	and he's like sitting crisscross applesauce
2089660	2091020	and having his nails painted.
2091020	2095140	And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.
2095140	2097800	You mean Cal, your own character?
2098080	2098920	I don't fucking know.
2098920	2100640	I thought you were saying I was doing that.
2100640	2101960	That would work too.
2102880	2103960	Oh, Beck.
2103960	2106600	Well, she did want to do yours next, but that's okay.
2106600	2107920	I can do them later.
2107920	2108760	Let's.
2115480	2116360	Are you leaving?
2116360	2117440	I'm so sorry.
2117440	2119880	It was so nice to meet you and all your friends.
2119880	2122320	But anytime, if you feel like you miss us,
2122320	2124440	you can just tune in to the local news
2124440	2125400	and you'll see me again.
2125400	2128560	This is Cal, Colorado saying it was nice to meet you.
2128560	2129400	Oh, yeah.
2130960	2131800	Give a little high five.
2131800	2132640	Oh, a little high five.
2132640	2134300	Boop, boop.
2134300	2138600	Julius is gonna see if he can lift up this safe.
2138600	2143600	As you go to lift up the safe with those thick thighs,
2143920	2145960	give me a strength.
2149120	2150840	You can't pick up a fucking safe.
2150840	2152200	Five on a 50.
2152200	2154880	But as you lift it up off the ground,
2155320	2158040	you see that there's no bottom on it.
2158040	2160720	Like you're just lifting the top up off.
2160720	2162820	It's like not connected to its base.
2162820	2165880	And is there anything on the ground?
2165880	2168360	Yeah, yeah, there's stacks and stacks of cash.
2168360	2171500	He's gonna take some, not all.
2173520	2175720	When you're walking out into the living room,
2175720	2178080	do you have the cash on you or have you already?
2178080	2180740	I have it, well, there's that little girl.
2180740	2182840	Yep, Julius has it in his hands and is like,
2182960	2184760	guys, he stole from us.
2184760	2187480	Wow, is that all money?
2187480	2188600	Monopoly money.
2188600	2190280	I'm not allowed to play that game yet.
2190280	2192280	Yes, it's a cutthroat game,
2192280	2194400	far too cruel for one of your age.
2194400	2195620	That's what my mom says.
2195620	2196460	Where did you get that?
2196460	2197640	Where did you get that, Julius?
2197640	2199480	The safe is bad.
2199480	2200640	The safe was no good.
2200640	2201920	The safe is bad.
2201920	2202760	No bottom.
2202760	2204520	I don't even begin to know what you mean.
2204520	2205920	He just kept points in the room,
2205920	2207760	he's like, go check it out.
2207760	2208600	I think you're pointing at me
2208600	2210080	like I don't know what he fucking said.
2210080	2215080	I don't know what it means either.
2215500	2218520	Yeah, Cal, I mean, Cal walks in there like dumbfounded
2218520	2219640	and sees all the money.
2219640	2220480	Beck follows.
2220480	2222840	Yeah, there's probably 35, 40 Gs in here.
2222840	2224440	But is that all there is?
2224440	2226260	Oh no, there's a bunch of papers and stuff too.
2226260	2227680	Julius, put that back
2227680	2229980	and start filming one of your TikToks.
2229980	2230820	He does.
2230820	2233960	Does Cal want to be in it or?
2233960	2235640	Cal just stands in front of the safe
2235640	2237000	and says, do a boomerang.
2237000	2238000	Can you still do boomerang?
2238000	2239360	Julius.
2239480	2240680	And he starts dabbing.
2240680	2242720	Julius puts down the phone and is like,
2242720	2246080	maybe we shouldn't document this.
2246080	2246920	No, no, no.
2246920	2248320	Okay, well, get pictures.
2248320	2249240	Beck, you're filming, right?
2249240	2250080	Oh yes.
2250080	2251180	We need to document that this man
2251180	2252740	has been paid off by the goddess.
2252740	2255840	Is the paperwork or anything in there
2255840	2257920	give any indication where the money came from?
2257920	2259520	I would like to flip through it as I'm filming.
2259520	2260680	Yeah, what else is going?
2260680	2263240	I'm getting scans basically of the documents.
2263240	2264340	Oh yeah, that's great.
2264340	2266560	That's what you need to do.
2266560	2269160	Roll accounting, everyone who's checking this out.
2270120	2271400	Wow, I have accounting.
2271400	2274380	Could I roll bureaucracy?
2274380	2275600	No, I'm going to go with accounting.
2275600	2278800	I got a crit success, a 33 on a 50.
2278800	2280840	Okay, that's awesome.
2282680	2284400	These figures are all a little bit over my head.
2284400	2285600	Does anybody know what these mean?
2285600	2286600	Oh, Julius.
2286600	2287440	Let me take a look.
2287440	2288880	You know what this means.
2288880	2292980	Wilson Wiley seems to be on the payroll
2292980	2295600	for some sort of a nonprofit.
2295600	2299240	And as you follow the trail of money
2299240	2302840	through all of these stacks of papers and papers
2302840	2305400	with your keen accounting skills
2305400	2308400	and that critical success, you flip through
2308400	2311800	and you can draw a direct line from the Godel company
2311800	2315240	to a shell, to a shell, to a shell, to a shell,
2315240	2316380	to this nonprofit.
2316380	2318720	The nonprofit's called Where's The Money?
2318720	2320400	I don't know, not here.
2320400	2321640	W-A-R.
2321640	2322760	W-A-R-E.
2324020	2324860	Duh.
2324860	2326260	Duh.
2326260	2328200	Holy shit.
2328200	2329580	There's something big here.
2329580	2331260	What is it in a few short words?
2331260	2334400	He's on the Godel's payroll, 100%.
2334400	2335240	How do you know?
2335240	2336060	It's all in here.
2336060	2339660	And Julius holds up all the paperwork and documents,
2339660	2341780	pockets it, leaves the money.
2341780	2342920	He's like, we should go.
2342920	2345220	This just became very dangerous.
2345220	2347200	I don't know if we need to take anything with us
2347200	2348980	because I've got it all on camera.
2348980	2350300	Alertness checks, please.
2353100	2354060	Crit fail.
2355260	2359340	I pass a two on a 40.
2359340	2361120	Tell me if I got these out to hand to you also.
2361120	2363060	I fail, a 62 on a 40.
2363060	2365460	Sorry, I keep meaning to get up and get my own.
2365460	2367980	Beck, you're the only one who hears the ding.
2367980	2368820	Of the elevator?
2368820	2369640	Of the elevator.
2372880	2374020	What ding?
2374020	2375520	The egg timer on the counter.
2377980	2378820	Egg.
2378820	2383820	I get big eyes and I, Carol, Julius, that was the elevator.
2384180	2387020	I think we really need to get out of here and quick.
2387020	2387860	Oh, fuck.
2387860	2388780	Let's hoof it, boys.
2388780	2391820	Julius is gonna keep, he's gonna keep the papers,
2391820	2394340	leave everything else and hoof it.
2394340	2395560	Thank you so much for your time.
2395560	2396740	I would love to have the tea party
2396740	2399100	with you and Tereza and Rachel sometime.
2399100	2400060	Absolutely, okay.
2400060	2400900	Bye, Conquerel.
2400900	2402460	Goodbye, and remember what I said about the TV
2402460	2403800	and good luck.
2403800	2405780	She holds out her arms for a hug.
2405780	2407660	If you give her the hug, you're gonna get caught in the room.
2407660	2412540	No, no, I give her a high five in each open hand
2412540	2414180	and a thumbs up and a wink is like,
2414180	2416220	I'm running backwards out the front door.
2417660	2419800	Julius says, don't tell anyone we were here.
2419800	2420700	Nobody will believe you.
2420700	2421700	The three of you like.
2421700	2422540	Shh.
2431280	2433140	The three of you slam into the wall,
2433140	2436340	like the hall wall on the other side away from this door
2436340	2439860	as the door slams shut and you turn
2439860	2441260	and looking down the hall,
2441260	2444180	you see a woman in her mid thirties
2444180	2447460	carrying like four bags of groceries,
2447460	2452460	tote bags walking toward you with suspicious eyes
2452620	2456380	and I need whoever has the highest bureaucracy.
2456380	2457220	I got a 50.
2457220	2458060	I got a 70.
2458060	2458880	I got a 50.
2459940	2461580	To roll.
2461580	2462400	35.
2462400	2463460	Hello, excuse me.
2463460	2464300	Hello, yes.
2464300	2465120	Is everything okay?
2465120	2469100	Yes, yes, we were looking for apartment 936.
2469100	2470980	Oh, one floor up.
2471580	2472540	This is the eighth floor.
2472540	2473380	Oh.
2473380	2475620	I told you, I thought we might have hit that.
2475620	2476460	Idiot.
2476460	2478180	He always does this.
2478180	2479700	He's quite stupid, ma'am.
2479700	2481100	Anyway, have a nice day.
2481100	2483740	She's smiling, not really paying attention.
2483740	2486220	She puts her key in the door and goes in.
2486220	2488500	And yeah, I'm like waving nervously
2488500	2490700	and frantically pressing the elevator button.
2493920	2495340	It's not coming.
2495340	2497300	No, it's right there because she just came up on it
2497300	2499180	and you hop into the elevator.
2499180	2500620	You going up to the ninth?
2501420	2503740	Yeah, I press one and as the door is closed,
2503740	2505260	I make a show of like being like,
2505260	2506940	you pressed one, not nine.
2506940	2509260	We'll have to do it all over again.
2509260	2510600	Silly man.
2510600	2511780	She's like already in her apartment.
2511780	2512620	Yeah, she's gone.
2516120	2517260	Deep cover.
2517260	2518740	How was your friend?
2518740	2520700	They were not at home, unfortunately.
2521780	2524220	We just sat outside their apartment knocking
2524220	2526180	for roughly 15 minutes.
2526180	2527020	What a shame.
2527020	2527840	Who was it again?
2527840	2530500	Oh, we call them Gramps.
2531460	2532580	We call them Gramps.
2532580	2533420	Oh, oh, Gramps.
2533420	2535140	They'll always just be Gramps to us.
2535140	2536420	You have a good one, sir.
2536420	2537260	Yeah.
2537260	2538100	We've got places to be.
2538100	2539200	Same to you.
2539200	2541960	Grabbing a little persuade on the way out.
2541960	2542800	Do I get in on that?
2542800	2544500	Yeah, 58 on an 80.
2546060	2549440	39 on a 50, yeah, 50.
2549440	2550280	You both rolled higher.
2550280	2551120	I didn't talk.
2552260	2554900	You both rolled higher and therefore he's just like,
2554900	2559640	huh, oh, I guess maybe Desmond is Gramps.
2559640	2560960	And then he's back to thinking about
2560960	2562460	whatever he's thinking about before.
2562460	2565200	Just how many times he can jerk off in a day.
2566600	2567960	Without thinking it's weird.
2567960	2569440	Without thinking it's weird.
2573280	2576040	I'm gonna go pee again for the millionth time.
2576040	2578280	I wanna get on record real quick.
2578280	2581440	Is anybody else curious why that was a bureaucracy role
2581440	2583840	to walk past her or was that a mistake?
2583840	2586540	I think he made it up or maybe he didn't.
2586540	2588560	Yeah, I never really know.
2590360	2593560	Sometimes I think we put not enough faith in Zach
2593560	2597140	and sometimes I think we put far too much.
2597140	2599120	Yeah, that's why I'm just like, I don't know.
2599120	2599960	I don't know.
2599960	2600800	I don't know either.
2600800	2601620	I don't know.
2601620	2602460	Go pee, okay.
2602460	2603800	What was the last thing we said?
2603800	2605580	Wait, one, two, three, nose goes, nose goes.
2605580	2606420	I think that was me.
2606420	2607260	It was.
2607260	2610120	And we're back and you guys have just headed down
2610120	2611640	into the parking garage here,
2611640	2614720	hopping in that Mercedes C-Class and heading out,
2614720	2616840	saying goodbye to the nice gentleman
2616840	2618400	who's waiting at the elevator,
2618440	2620040	thinking about J and O.
2620040	2621040	My Dave!
2621040	2622920	How we looking on time?
2622920	2624960	Oh, time?
2624960	2626240	It is time.
2626240	2628780	You see a text on your phone right now.
2628780	2629740	What's it say?
2629740	2632280	And it just says ETA question mark
2632280	2635740	because it is time for you to be at the can station.
2635740	2637960	Tell him we're caught in construction on the freeway.
2637960	2639520	It's gonna be a little while,
2639520	2641640	but we're bringing him the story of a lifetime
2641640	2644600	and we're going to fucking Richard Riley's house.
2644600	2646720	I text type traffic
2646760	2648880	and then we head to Richard Riley's house.
2648880	2652280	Oh, shit.
2652280	2655400	We could also like make it like a Zoom call
2655400	2656620	and just do it from here.
2656620	2658340	Maybe we can find that idea.
2658340	2660680	We need the footage first, but yes, that could work.
2660680	2663680	After I send traffic, I say FaceTime question mark.
2663680	2666760	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
2666760	2669720	Okay, guys, it's time for...
2671240	2674740	Hey, what's up my fucking nephew?
2674740	2676360	How you living?
2677360	2680360	Oh, it's good to be me and it's good to be you,
2680360	2682740	but you are not here.
2682740	2683920	And you said you were gonna be here.
2683920	2685720	What the fuck is up?
2685720	2688280	Not base bro, not base bro.
2688280	2689320	Forget about it.
2689320	2692720	Yeah, I mean, it's a good thing that we got
2692720	2694640	Cloud Atlas in Cal's car
2694640	2697040	because the traffic is just crazy.
2697040	2702040	A phenomenal film takes me back to my Lake Tahoe days.
2702880	2704480	From the womb to the tomb, right?
2704520	2708320	Yes, sir, and I am hungry to see you.
2708320	2710280	Where is Cal?
2710280	2711120	Where's Beck?
2711120	2711940	Where are you?
2711940	2714280	I kind of show the car,
2714280	2717340	trying not to like let him see that the traffic
2717340	2719980	may not be as bad as we said,
2719980	2721140	but I show like Cal and Beck.
2721140	2724400	I'm like, they're in the car here with me.
2724400	2725240	Say hi, guys.
2725240	2728040	Beck gives a wave as the camera pans.
2728040	2730880	Yeah, Cal gives a little salute and says,
2730880	2732520	great to see you, Typh.
2732560	2735000	Hey, we're working on the story of a lifetime here.
2735000	2737440	I think you're gonna like what your nephew serves up to you.
2737440	2739280	Obviously, traffic's a little behind
2739280	2743080	and we're always pursuing any possible lead.
2743080	2744200	I'm sitting here driving
2744200	2748120	and I'm telling Beck what to film for some good B-roll
2748120	2751120	and also he's Googling different sources
2751120	2752320	and calling them and things.
2752320	2756080	I'm not worried about whether you're working or not.
2756080	2759120	I just gotta have the three of you come in right now.
2759120	2761920	Well, as soon as traffic permits, we'll be there,
2762440	2765400	but we're really, oh, Cal honks on his horn.
2765400	2768720	He's like, beep, beep, beep, you dummy.
2769560	2771600	Yeah, it's just real nuts out here.
2771600	2774040	Lots of wrecks, lots of construction.
2774040	2776680	Oh, wow, I think I just saw another one.
2776680	2777520	Oh.
2777520	2778340	Another one.
2778340	2782300	Ah, like I said, well, I'm hungry for you to come on back,
2782300	2783840	so get on back here.
2783840	2785520	Yeah, yeah, are you actually hungry?
2785520	2787480	We could stop and get some food for you.
2787480	2788320	No, no, absolutely.
2788320	2789160	We'll go ahead and do that.
2789160	2790160	We'll add that to the list.
2790160	2791360	Do not stop.
2791760	2793800	Oh, wow, horrible reception.
2797080	2798180	Cal's just doing that.
2799640	2801640	And I'm like, uh, oh, eh, uh.
2805480	2808240	And like Julius is like freezing his face
2808240	2809800	and like making that sound and then.
2809800	2813240	He can see like the traffic behind you moving smoothly.
2813240	2814080	Like.
2818860	2821240	Oh, that was strange.
2821240	2823280	We'll be in by the end of the day.
2823280	2824480	All right, end of the day.
2824480	2826440	I mean, I need you here right away,
2826440	2828400	straight here right now, okay?
2828400	2831440	Otherwise it's back to Barstow for you, Julius.
2832480	2834820	Cause I ain't going back to Barstow, that's all you.
2834820	2836520	I thought you said Barstool.
2836520	2838320	Ah, no, I didn't.
2838320	2839720	I don't want to work for that guy.
2839720	2841840	No, ew, ew.
2841840	2843800	Who would ever want to work for a guy like that
2843800	2845880	when you go work for me, bro?
2845880	2848560	Julius kind of looks at Cal and Beck like.
2848560	2850680	I've heard him say many times at the Foundry
2851040	2853240	that his dream job is to work for Barstool.
2856240	2857960	We'll be in ASAP.
2857960	2859800	I don't know your dream job, Julius.
2859800	2861800	You'll have to tell me after this call.
2861800	2862640	He hangs up.
2863600	2866280	He says like bye, but that he kind of hangs up.
2866280	2868720	Julius would love to work for Barstool Sports.
2870920	2873040	Hello, this is Julius Summers.
2873040	2874760	Welcome back to Call Me Daddy.
2874760	2877800	These thighs were made for Barstool.
2880680	2885680	What is that guy's name?
2886140	2887320	Dave something?
2887320	2888160	Portnoy.
2888160	2889000	I was going to say it's Portnoy.
2889000	2889840	Port something.
2889840	2890680	Portnoy, yeah.
2890680	2891520	Dave Cooley.
2891520	2893480	The drummer for, all right, let's go.
2893480	2894600	Oh, Will Ferrell.
2894600	2896160	The drummer for Will Ferrell.
2898360	2901300	Okay, I'm going to try to watch some more Cloud Atlas
2901300	2903560	before we get to Richard's house.
2903560	2906760	I mean, couldn't you be doing something more productive
2906760	2908160	like editing a TikTok?
2908160	2909260	We are at work.
2909260	2913740	I mean, I don't think Julius has any TikToks to edit.
2913740	2916820	He's going to post, he'll post a Grover's Gorge TikTok.
2916820	2917860	Nice.
2917860	2918700	A good one.
2918700	2919980	A little teaser.
2919980	2920860	Another little tease.
2920860	2922340	Another little tease.
2922340	2923260	Yes, we can.
2923260	2928260	When you go on, you see that the previous two TikToks
2929100	2932200	that you've uploaded with Grover's Gorge footage
2932200	2933300	have been deleted.
2933300	2936420	Julius immediately goes to the settings
2936420	2938420	and changes the password for the TikTok.
2938460	2940980	Okay, I'm going to have you roll
2940980	2944980	because it might send an email
2944980	2947140	that you have to change the password to,
2947140	2949100	but it might two-factor you.
2949100	2951700	Well, you could see what email it would be sending to.
2951700	2954700	Let's just get a luck roll since we're playing a dice game.
2954700	2956180	I want under 50.
2956180	2957020	No, actually.
2959360	2960420	88.
2960420	2962260	Oh, no.
2962260	2963980	Oh, boy.
2963980	2965180	That's the worst one.
2969100	2971140	You're locked out.
2971140	2972420	You're not sure what happened,
2972420	2975260	but when you go to TikTok on your browser,
2975260	2977980	that most recent TikTok, also not there,
2977980	2981020	and a new text from Tyf, come in now.
2981020	2982540	Oh, shit.
2982540	2985580	Julius does not share that information and-
2985580	2986420	Oh, shit!
2989620	2993300	Julius thinks if they go talk to Tyf,
2993300	2995780	they're not going to, this story's done.
2995820	2998780	So he wants to get done what he can now.
2998780	3000500	How's that TikTok coming, buddy?
3000500	3001500	I'm working on it.
3001500	3002420	Forgot the password.
3002420	3004580	If you just hit forgot password,
3004580	3006380	I think it'll send you.
3006380	3008300	Zach, when you said deleted,
3008300	3010660	did you meant deleted by the user
3010660	3013660	or deleted removed by TikTok?
3013660	3016540	How would you be able to see a difference?
3016540	3019440	You would only know from the poster's end.
3019440	3021940	It would tell you if it had been removed.
3021940	3022780	Oh, yeah.
3022780	3025260	No, there wasn't a notification that it had been flagged.
3025780	3028780	Good question, because some content on there
3028780	3030540	could have definitely been flagged.
3033540	3036460	This TikTok made me feel bad.
3036460	3040300	Or misinformation, and Godel has TikTok too.
3040300	3043340	Uh-oh, vroom, vroom, right?
3043340	3044300	Vroom, vroom, vroom.
3047980	3048820	We're here.
3048820	3051900	Are we at the home of Richard Reilly
3051900	3054540	or are we at the can station?
3054580	3055940	Where do you think, sucker?
3058380	3060620	It's the mill all over again.
3063820	3065860	On your way, you get into a fiery wreck.
3065860	3066680	Yeah.
3068300	3072580	These characters die and everything they know dies with them.
3072580	3073940	I'm done with you.
3075620	3077280	You're all playing Rachel now.
3079700	3080540	Wait, Rachel.
3080540	3081380	Wait, Rachel.
3081380	3086180	Inside the city, there's a gated community, a suburb.
3086180	3088580	Wow, that's expensive.
3088580	3090940	That is where Richard Reilly lives.
3090940	3094180	He is an officer of the city police department
3094180	3098700	and you are pulling up to a guard house outside of a gate.
3098700	3100380	Is it Dave's twin brother?
3102140	3104260	Think about that for a second, Julius.
3104260	3106140	Wouldn't they have the same last name?
3106140	3107700	No, the guard.
3107700	3109340	I didn't catch Dave's last name.
3111420	3113620	It's a guy who looks suspiciously like Dave.
3116060	3121060	The slightly better off brother of the two.
3121260	3122220	He gets to sit down.
3122220	3123040	A little more hair.
3123040	3123880	Yeah, out.
3128820	3130460	More hair, better person.
3130460	3131300	Right.
3135820	3139540	Joe flicks his fucking Fabio, man.
3139860	3142620	Kind of looking around, I'm like, I see what you mean.
3145020	3147140	It's crazy how much hair comes out of my head
3147140	3148580	and it still looks this good.
3148580	3149420	Fuck you.
3151220	3153560	Well, hello there.
3153560	3154660	Whoa, Dave.
3154660	3158960	Oh, I've always been called that my whole life, but no.
3158960	3161740	And he taps slowly on his name badge.
3161740	3162580	Darren.
3162580	3163400	Hello, Darren.
3163400	3165740	I'm Cal Colorado from the news.
3165740	3168300	Whoa, it's been a while, sir.
3168300	3172860	We're actually doing a report on a local security agents.
3172860	3173820	Heroes.
3173820	3176300	Local security heroes.
3176300	3180740	Whoa, and you want to interview me?
3180740	3183580	I do want to interview you, Darren.
3183580	3186140	But first-
3186140	3188300	Do you have a shot of adrenaline or anything?
3189620	3191380	I'm sure we've got something back here,
3191380	3196020	but I can Venmo you and you can source that yourself.
3196020	3198580	But first we need to see an old family friend
3198580	3201140	who lives in the inside.
3201140	3204900	Could you let us in real quick so we can check on them?
3204900	3207060	They had a small gift they wanted to give.
3207060	3209180	Yeah, who are you going to see?
3209180	3211060	Oh, we just call them Gramps.
3213560	3214980	Will it work again?
3216380	3217220	Will it blend?
3217220	3220680	Will it blend, will it blend?
3223460	3224620	26 pass.
3224620	3225660	60 pass.
3225660	3226500	Fuck you.
3226500	3227860	Nice.
3227860	3229940	Gramps, Gramps, Gramps, Gramps.
3229940	3231420	Yeah, well, we're worried
3231420	3233020	there's not much more time with Gramps.
3233020	3235060	And he said he had something he really wanted to give us.
3235060	3237380	But afterwards, we'll come interview you.
3237380	3240900	Well, that makes me awfully excited
3240900	3242780	as he clicks the button and says,
3242780	3246140	tell Gramps hello and have a good day.
3246140	3247460	See you soon.
3247460	3249920	I'm sure he will be happy to hear from you.
3249920	3253800	He speaks so highly of you and all his letters.
3253960	3256760	Oh, me, wah, and you.
3259080	3260640	He's beautiful, but he's dying.
3263520	3265280	And we're looking for the house
3265280	3269600	that has like the metal archway that says Riley on it.
3271280	3272300	Gross.
3274440	3276000	Yeah, there's a big one there, huh?
3276000	3280600	And it's got like a shield on one side
3280600	3282960	and a eagle on the other.
3283000	3286160	Like, you know, laser cut into the metal.
3286160	3287440	It says Lorem Ipsum.
3293880	3295040	Yeah, you know, we just got some cool
3295040	3296240	Latin shit put up there.
3299140	3302080	Roll luck and answer the question.
3302080	3304960	Well, we have to answer the question and then roll luck.
3304960	3306760	What's the question?
3306760	3307880	The question is,
3307880	3310820	would you like there to be a car in the driveway?
3311780	3314680	Seems like something you shouldn't have decided.
3318020	3319580	I'll roll then.
3319580	3321540	A lack of preparation on your part
3321540	3323780	does not represent a crisis on ours.
3324780	3329500	There is a minivan in the driveway.
3329500	3330640	You said car.
3330640	3334820	There is a station wagon.
3334820	3335660	Damn it.
3336620	3337920	He still made a family.
3340820	3341660	That's a nice one.
3341660	3342500	Cal brings like the C class.
3342500	3344660	Actually, no, there's a shitty station wagon
3344660	3345500	in the driveway.
3346820	3347660	Oh, cause he doesn't.
3347660	3348960	He hates his family.
3348960	3350060	I hate my wife.
3357620	3360940	Cal brings the C class to like a stop nearby
3360940	3362700	and he's like peering over the steering wheel
3362700	3364340	and kind of glaring at the scene.
3364340	3366020	He's like, what do you think boys?
3366020	3369140	I mean, I think as bad as much as I've ever thought
3369140	3370220	this whole time.
3370460	3372740	We got to get the footage, but I don't know how.
3372740	3374380	I mean, do we just talk to him?
3374380	3377220	I mean, we could confront him and you know,
3377220	3380480	his reaction is kind of some sort of, you know, evidence,
3380480	3383100	but I don't know.
3383100	3383940	Maybe if we like.
3383940	3385300	I don't think this is his car.
3385300	3386140	First of all,
3386140	3389140	I think we're going to be dealing with another mom.
3389140	3389980	Yeah.
3389980	3391180	Well, I can take the mom.
3393640	3395940	Julius son, no offense,
3395940	3397880	but you should leave the mom to me.
3400220	3404100	And with that,
3404100	3407620	Julius is instilled with the confidence of the group
3407620	3409340	and rings the doorbell.
3418900	3420100	No, thank you.
3420100	3422420	Cal, Cal, use your voice.
3424580	3426260	Hit him with it, Cal.
3426260	3427120	Hello, ma'am.
3427120	3429820	It's Cal Colorado City Action News
3430660	3431480	is your husband home.
3431480	3432320	Jesus Christ.
3432320	3433160	Roll that.
3433160	3434060	That's the stuff.
3434060	3435400	That's the stuff.
3436500	3437500	Roll what?
3437500	3440300	Persuade, I think, or charisma.
3440300	3441420	33 crit success.
3441420	3443900	Holy fucking shit.
3443900	3445300	Door swings open.
3449220	3451020	Curlers, robe, cigarette.
3452180	3454140	She goes, he never is.
3454140	3456620	Cal like turns to you guys and has like a shocked look
3456620	3457460	on his face.
3457460	3458280	He's like, ah.
3458280	3460640	She turns around, starts walking away from you
3460640	3462760	and yelling over her shoulder essentially.
3462760	3465680	I thought this big house would be better
3465680	3468480	than leaving me alone in a shitty apartment.
3468480	3470560	And I guess that's right, but fuck.
3470560	3471960	Not much better it would seem.
3471960	3476400	Well, you know, a woman needs attention, care,
3476400	3477800	someone to love them.
3477800	3479440	Yes, don't we all?
3479440	3480340	Would you?
3480340	3481440	She's pouring a drink.
3481440	3482600	A bourbon neat, please.
3482600	3484040	Oh, Beck, what would you like?
3484040	3487120	Um, red bull and vodka?
3488560	3491040	And Julius, this is young Julius,
3491040	3493520	our new executive producer.
3493520	3496240	He's kind of a rising star here at Cannes.
3496240	3497680	Oh, are ya?
3497680	3499240	I'd like to think that I am,
3499240	3502480	but you know, I've got a lot to learn from the man.
3502480	3504320	Well, if it's a ladder to climb,
3504320	3505880	you'll have no problem.
3505880	3508640	As she eyes you down and down.
3510200	3511800	It's like, what does that mean?
3514920	3517560	I was like, how does she know he's a corporate striver?
3519120	3522480	She can smell it on.
3522480	3525760	She can see through into men's souls.
3525760	3527520	Julius flexes his thighs
3527520	3532520	and you can hear like a little seam rip.
3534160	3537480	Ooh, I got a little pumpin' at the lake earlier.
3537480	3539920	What business do you have with my husband?
3539920	3541800	Well, as she hands you each your drink.
3541800	3542640	Oh, thank you.
3542640	3543680	Thank you very much.
3543680	3544800	What was your name, ma'am?
3544800	3545640	Debs.
3545640	3547160	Debs Richards?
3547240	3548560	Debs Richards.
3548560	3551280	Debs, Debs Riley. Richard's wife?
3553560	3556000	Wow, is that all I am?
3556000	3556840	Of Richard?
3556840	3558000	That seems like all I am.
3558000	3560840	He drags me around to these places
3560840	3564040	to show me off black tie events
3564040	3567200	with a bunch of the worst people in the fuckin' world.
3567200	3568360	Oh, what do you mean by that?
3568360	3572000	Charities, nonprofits, you know the type.
3572000	3572840	Ah, yes.
3572840	3574240	Yeah, evil people.
3575200	3576120	Such ghouls.
3577200	3579520	What is his rank in the police force?
3579520	3580360	Wouldn't know it.
3580360	3582760	Talking to him these days, the head on him.
3582760	3584280	Just an officer.
3584280	3586120	I see, and what is he doing
3586120	3587760	at all these charity functions
3587760	3589640	with the who's who of the city?
3589640	3591440	He's rubbing elbows.
3591440	3592680	He's having a good time.
3592680	3593920	He's making friends.
3593920	3594840	Well, you used to have to,
3594840	3595680	you usually have to show up
3595680	3597080	to those kinds of things with cash.
3597080	3599560	I mean, I've hosted the Cal Colorado-
3599560	3600680	Comedy Hour.
3603160	3604960	Hold on, what should it be for?
3604960	3606240	Youth sports.
3606240	3607840	Youth sports is solid.
3607840	3610400	I've hosted the Cal Colorado Junior-
3613240	3614080	Damn it.
3614080	3615000	Debate League.
3616440	3617520	That's good.
3617520	3619880	That's really good.
3619880	3622680	I've hosted the Cal Colorado Black Tie Fundraiser
3622680	3625320	for Children's Leukemia for the last 15 years.
3625320	3627320	Oh wow, how much you make off that?
3627320	3628880	Oh, I don't make anything, ma'am.
3628880	3630560	In fact, a great deal of my own personal money
3630560	3631480	goes into it each year,
3631480	3633760	but we've raised over $20 million in that time.
3633760	3634600	Wow.
3634600	3635440	Wow.
3635920	3636760	Wow, wow.
3636760	3638880	Perhaps you'd like to go with Julius this year.
3638880	3640240	She looks up at your eyes.
3643840	3644880	Yeah, we know about the thighs.
3644880	3646240	How are Julius's eyes?
3646240	3648360	Julius says, my thighs are down here.
3649840	3653400	We were supposed to pick up some important stuff
3653400	3654480	from your husband.
3654480	3655920	He said he'd be here,
3655920	3658800	but we can just, we're kind of in a hurry.
3658800	3659640	We can just grab it.
3659640	3661080	If you just point us to the office,
3661080	3662880	we'll be right, right as rain.
3662880	3663800	I don't care.
3663840	3667480	I'm in my cups and he crit succeeded, so.
3667480	3668720	Oh, when was that?
3668720	3671080	Oh, I mean, as soon as I heard you
3671080	3673240	on the other side of the door.
3673240	3674120	Oh, you mean me?
3674120	3675680	Yeah.
3675680	3677120	Oh.
3677120	3679720	I was giving you a lot of credit as a game master
3679720	3681920	and you're like, you had rolled out their interaction
3681920	3683440	as a couple earlier this morning.
3683440	3684520	He crit succeeded.
3684520	3685960	I'm like, what's that?
3685960	3688080	And he's like, don't fucking worry about it.
3688080	3693080	Don't fucking worry about it.
3697640	3700720	Yes, your husband was reviewing some footage for us
3700720	3703440	in a capacity as a expert consultant.
3703440	3706360	We needed to see a law man's opinion of things.
3706360	3707200	Footage?
3707200	3711400	No, he said he was taking the footage to the nature hole.
3711400	3712560	The nature hole?
3712560	3713400	Yeah.
3713400	3716320	Cal slams his drink and he says, thank you very much, man.
3718840	3719680	Dude.
3719680	3720520	Thanks, man.
3720520	3721360	Thanks, bro.
3724360	3725800	Thanks, man deuces.
3728320	3729560	Thank you very much, man.
3729560	3730680	It's been a pleasure to meet you.
3730680	3733560	I just remembered we're late for our interview with Darren,
3733560	3735000	your gatekeeper, but.
3735000	3736400	Oh, I love Darren.
3736400	3737720	He's a good guy, right?
3737720	3739120	Yeah, you can send him in.
3739120	3741960	Cal is like scribbling down a number and he's like,
3741960	3744360	if you have anything else you'd like to contribute
3744360	3747680	to the story, you can reach Julius here at any time.
3747680	3748880	She takes it.
3748880	3750800	She slips it into her pocket.
3750800	3752080	Julius is heading towards the door
3752080	3755480	and he says, I'll see you later, I guess.
3755480	3756520	Lorem Ipsum.
3760880	3761880	Don't blow it, kid.
3763600	3765120	No, it's charming.
3765120	3766720	Guys, we gotta get to the hole.
3767880	3769560	We've got to get to the nature hole.
3769560	3771640	The nature hole, that's where our footage is?
3771640	3772720	That's what she said, right?
3772720	3773760	Do you think it's our footage?
3773760	3775200	What other footage would he have?
3775200	3776640	That's true, he's just a cop.
3776640	3778040	He's just a stupid cop.
3778040	3779840	And the nature hole's on this piece of paper
3779840	3781320	that we found, too.
3781320	3782160	What?
3783080	3783920	The connection.
3783920	3785480	Oh yeah, you here, look.
3785480	3787400	SG, nature hole.
3788440	3790880	There's some streets here and it says, follow down.
3790880	3791720	Let's go.
3791720	3792840	Can crew away.
3798440	3802640	Thomas, Joe, take off your headphones, please.
3802640	3804400	I've got something for this.
3804400	3807760	I remember to bring my headphones
3807760	3810760	so I don't have to wiggle in my ears.
3811760	3815920	It's really tiring when it goes on for like six minutes.
3815920	3817040	Sex minutes.
3817040	3818480	Chicken off only at six.
3819400	3821080	When you Google nature hole,
3821080	3823520	drill bits on Alibaba come up.
3823520	3824760	Interesting.
3824760	3825600	That's one of my favorite bands.
3825600	3826440	Did you do that?
3826440	3828120	They opened up for Wet Lake.
3829800	3831600	Drill bits on Alibaba.
3831600	3832440	For real?
3832440	3833280	Yeah.
3833280	3834120	For real?
3834880	3836840	So, Thomas, Joe.
3836840	3838680	Cool, neither one of them reacted.
3838680	3839520	Hey, Luke.
3839520	3840680	They're good at pretending.
3842000	3842840	To what?
3842840	3845320	Hey, you get a text on your phone?
3845320	3846160	Duh.
3846160	3847000	Yeah.
3847000	3847840	It's from-
3847840	3848680	Type.
3848680	3849520	Yeah.
3849520	3850360	What's it say?
3850360	3851320	Love ya.
3851320	3852160	Nephew.
3853520	3854360	What does it say?
3854360	3856960	It does, it starts off, I love you, nephew.
3856960	3859680	I need you to come and bring Beck and Cal.
3859680	3861400	I text Beck, yeah, for sure.
3861400	3862840	Like I said, end of day.
3862840	3863920	By the end of the day.
3864560	3865800	He texts Beck, he says,
3865800	3867880	this is good news, come right now.
3867880	3870240	Is there any, can I humant a text?
3873800	3876160	I say, just like, what's it about?
3876160	3878520	A promotion, is the response.
3881080	3885120	Julius has a new number one priority.
3887360	3888200	Yeah.
3888200	3889040	Yeah.
3889040	3889880	Should we bird him?
3889880	3890720	Let's bird him.
3890720	3893880	Caw, caw, caw, bird, bird, bird noise, bird noise.
3894880	3895800	I am a bird.
3895800	3897000	If you're a bird.
3897000	3897840	What kind of bird are you?
3897840	3898840	I'm a bird.
3898840	3899920	What kind of bird am I?
3899920	3902960	One that eats like bugs off a rhino.
3902960	3903800	No.
3903800	3904760	Oh, should we came in too early
3904760	3906720	and now we found out that he turned into a bird.
3906720	3909680	What kind of bird are you, Joe?
3909680	3910800	Big bird.
3910800	3911640	Big bird.
3913320	3914160	Thomas the bird?
3914160	3915840	The kind that eats birds like you for breakfast.
3915840	3916680	Dang.
3917920	3921160	You guys are driving vroom vroom.
3921160	3923200	Cal, you are behind the wheel.
3923240	3926520	You know that the natur hole is off
3926520	3929520	in a different direction than the can station.
3929520	3932320	It's gonna make you even later to this meeting
3932320	3934960	than you already are if you head that way.
3934960	3937360	Guys, I hate to say it, but I think, you know,
3937360	3940240	we have to have jobs in order to break news
3940240	3941680	and type's not happy.
3941680	3943280	I think we ought to stop by the station
3943280	3944640	before we go out there.
3944640	3945480	Yeah.
3945480	3947840	I mean, we could even, if you feel like we have to,
3947840	3950040	we can maybe talk around the issue while we're there.
3950040	3951760	You know, that we kind of feel them out.
3951760	3954360	Yeah, maybe I left the footage at my house
3954360	3957560	or just kind of give them the run around if we have to.
3957560	3959720	I mean, you can link them to the TikToks, right?
3959720	3961320	You can show them some of what we've got.
3961320	3962160	Yeah.
3962160	3965080	Because once he sees what we have, I mean-
3965080	3966600	It's like proof of concept, yeah.
3966600	3968060	Yeah, I'm sure I'll be like,
3968060	3970880	what are you even doing in my office?
3970880	3972400	Get back out there and follow the story.
3972400	3974080	The TikToks got deleted.
3974080	3974920	What do you mean?
3974920	3977120	I didn't want to worry you or anything,
3977120	3979000	but I wanted to go to Richard's,
3979000	3982680	but I think he deleted the TikToks or someone did.
3982680	3984920	Oh, I thought you were going to interview me.
3984920	3986200	Okay, bye.
3986200	3988420	Oh, I think that we're not even close.
3990520	3992180	He said that to himself like 10 minutes
3992180	3993180	after you guys left.
3995440	3996440	They're gone.
3996440	3997600	Yeah, so-
3997600	3999160	Took him that long to say it.
4000120	4003200	I mean, I was going to tell you, I kind of had forgotten,
4003200	4004920	but I didn't want to tell you-
4004920	4005760	He combed his hair.
4005760	4007400	So that we didn't go to Richard's.
4009040	4010080	I think, you know,
4010080	4012160	somebody's been deleting the TikToks.
4012160	4013840	Tyve is not happy with us.
4013840	4014880	I think we got to go.
4014880	4016120	I think we got to go talk to him.
4016120	4018040	It sounds like he wants to shut us down.
4018040	4020380	That adds a new wrinkle that, yeah,
4020380	4022520	that sounds like he's maybe,
4022520	4025440	I'm sorry, Julius, but maybe he's in on this?
4025440	4026780	Yes, as the Blues Brothers say,
4026780	4028400	this is track four, by the way.
4028400	4030720	It's cheaper to keep her about our jobs,
4030720	4032680	but I don't know,
4032680	4034980	it sounds like he doesn't want us to do our jobs.
4034980	4036080	If we get the footage,
4036080	4038640	we could sell it to any news agency in the world.
4039160	4041040	It's true, we might need to start thinking global.
4041040	4042680	We can go beyond these bastards.
4042680	4045800	Wouldn't it be easier to just keep our jobs
4045800	4047080	and do it here, though?
4047080	4049120	We have a lead on where the footage is right now.
4049120	4051420	If we don't act, we might never get it back.
4051420	4052540	Julius has a point, though,
4052540	4056760	that if we can maybe do some creative talking to Tyve,
4056760	4058120	maybe we'll get some resources
4058120	4059960	that can help us with our actual goal.
4059960	4061180	And we can just buy some time.
4061180	4064720	I mean, he's not going to fire us immediately
4064720	4068360	if, you know, we don't really tell him exactly
4068920	4069760	if he's on Godel's side, then.
4069760	4072520	We could even play the fool and be like,
4072520	4075200	yeah, this is for the good of Godel.
4075200	4077420	Cal slams the brakes, and he says,
4077420	4081460	I didn't nearly die in that piss-shit common blood pit
4081460	4083420	just to lose the evidence of it.
4083420	4086180	No one's gonna call Cal Colorado a liar about this.
4086180	4088640	If you wanna go see Tyve, take a fucking Uber.
4088640	4090340	I'm going to the natural hole.
4090340	4091760	I'm getting my story.
4091760	4093640	Take off your headphones real quick, Thomas and Joe.
4093640	4097320	As both a player and as Julius, I am torn.
4097320	4098520	You get a new text.
4098520	4100480	It says, just you is fine.
4100480	4101320	On my way.
4101320	4102140	Birds?
4102140	4103020	Birds.
4103020	4105920	I can't have me getting fired on my resume.
4105920	4107640	I gotta go see my uncle.
4107640	4109280	Will you guys please come with me?
4109280	4110600	Yeah, um.
4110600	4111560	Beck, go with him.
4111560	4113720	Yeah, I'll come, I'll come, Julius.
4113720	4115600	Cal, we should all go together,
4115600	4117560	but we just gotta check in with Tyve.
4117560	4119480	I think he's gonna fire you anyway, Julius.
4119480	4120320	Well.
4120320	4121480	I think you tell him to go fuck himself.
4121480	4122840	If you're gonna go.
4122840	4124680	You'll get a job once you put out
4124680	4126700	the greatest news story of all time.
4126740	4129100	I gotta go, but if you're gonna go anyway,
4129100	4130740	Beck, you should be there to document it.
4130740	4131720	I can do it on my own.
4131720	4132980	It's, it's just my uncle.
4132980	4134920	Hey, remember that we lost God?
4134920	4138760	Yeah.
4143000	4145060	Yeah, no, I wouldn't let Cal go alone.
4145060	4148420	I'm just, if Julius is saying that we need to go to Tyve,
4149500	4150340	I don't, I don't know.
4150340	4152900	It feels like maybe, maybe we should go see Tyve
4152900	4154540	and then go to the natural hole.
4154540	4156080	Call him again.
4156080	4157880	Actually, I'm going to call him.
4157880	4158720	Oh, okay.
4158720	4159800	Cal calls Tyve.
4159800	4161400	Bring, bring, bring, bring.
4161400	4164760	Hey, it's my guy, Cal Colorado.
4164760	4165620	How are you?
4165620	4167380	Oh, well, not very great, Tyve.
4167380	4168880	Yeah, get your ass down here.
4168880	4171120	I got some great fucking news for you.
4171120	4173800	You wanna be sitting at that head anchor desk again?
4173800	4175240	I take the phone off speaker.
4175240	4178080	Julius is looking at Beck like, Beck is giving thumbs up.
4178080	4180460	Holy shit, holy shit.
4180460	4181300	What do you mean?
4181300	4182460	I got an opportunity.
4182460	4185320	It's promotion time, but I need you and Julius
4185400	4186520	and Beck to come in.
4186520	4187760	Why do you need us to come in?
4187760	4190040	Because we have to do the paperwork
4190040	4191960	for your new promotion, of course.
4191960	4192840	I've got to tell you, Tyve,
4192840	4194580	we're working on something really big here.
4194580	4195420	I don't care.
4195420	4196720	I think the paperwork can wait.
4196720	4198000	It's going to be great.
4198000	4199500	I need you to come in now.
4199500	4201560	It's my promotion, Tyve, so.
4201560	4202800	Well, we'll see.
4202800	4206380	Isabella feels real confident in that spot, you know?
4206380	4207720	So I want to give it to you,
4207720	4210200	but I need you guys to come in.
4210200	4212480	Tyve, you've already taken this from me once.
4212480	4214000	I don't know if I trust your word,
4214000	4217120	but if you love Julius, if you love me,
4217120	4219380	if you actually care about your job here at the news,
4219380	4221240	you're going to want to let us pursue this story.
4221240	4223160	I love my job.
4223160	4224720	I love my life.
4224720	4226920	And I need you to come in.
4226920	4227860	So it's either that,
4227860	4231760	or I think we're going to have to have some harsher words.
4231760	4232580	Tyve?
4232580	4233420	Unfortunately.
4233420	4235900	Beck has given signals to get Cal's attention.
4235900	4237400	Joe is pointing down.
4237400	4239360	He's trying to muffle the receiver.
4239360	4242200	Joe is playing in a screwable game of tricks.
4242240	4243600	Muffle the receiver.
4243600	4244920	Muffle it.
4244920	4246860	Take it off your ear and muffle it.
4246860	4249640	I take it off my ear and like make a play show
4249640	4250480	of putting it on mute.
4250480	4252280	And he's like, I know about you.
4252280	4255540	Oh shit, hell yeah, Cal.
4255540	4257800	Dude, Cal, if he's offering to make you an anchor,
4257800	4260240	that's a win-win for us because you'll have the desk.
4260240	4262040	He can't tell you shit once you're live on air.
4262040	4263200	We just run the footage.
4263200	4264760	We're talking about to tape right now.
4264760	4268160	If you're on air and I put that thing in the video bay.
4268160	4269200	But we don't have the tape.
4269200	4270880	We'll have to get it, but I'm saying.
4270880	4271760	He's got it.
4271760	4273240	Or someone working with him.
4273240	4274620	Or the people paying them both.
4274620	4275460	Don't you see?
4275460	4276280	Tyfe's in on it.
4276280	4277120	Tyfe wants to kill it.
4277120	4278280	I don't think you're wrong,
4278280	4280520	but I also think that we can still make.
4280520	4282560	The anchor job is never going to happen.
4282560	4283620	He's trying to play me.
4283620	4286000	Unless he wants to put you on anchor to shut you up
4286000	4287340	and stop investigating.
4287340	4288660	That's exactly what he wants.
4288660	4291460	I'm saying we can get you on anchor and then we use that.
4291460	4293360	He promises it to me, but then never gives it.
4293360	4294200	Don't you see?
4294200	4296000	He can't control us outside of the office.
4296000	4297240	That's exactly my point.
4297240	4298760	We're outside of the office.
4298760	4300080	He cannot control us.
4300080	4302160	But I'm saying if we go now to the natural
4302160	4304200	and he just does straight up fire us.
4304200	4305020	So what?
4305020	4305860	We post it on TikTok.
4305860	4307200	We make a new TikTok.
4307200	4308560	We're locked out of the can TikTok.
4308560	4309680	It keeps getting deleted.
4309680	4311080	We'll make a cow TikTok.
4311080	4312640	But none of this is live on air.
4312640	4314160	This is all things that they control.
4314160	4316680	We've already seen that they got TikTok under wraps.
4316680	4317860	We'll make a new TikTok.
4317860	4320560	I think that they have the ability to take that stuff down.
4320560	4322120	What I'm saying is that we have the chance
4322120	4323640	to put this in front of eyeballs,
4323640	4325440	no matter who tells you no.
4325440	4327760	Once we get you on air live.
4327760	4329840	We have that if we have the footage, no matter what.
4330480	4331800	We can ship it to a dozen news agencies.
4331800	4334080	We can put it live on as many platforms as possible.
4334080	4335080	It's not live then though.
4335080	4337640	It's all to tape and they get to decide when they run it.
4337640	4340080	Beck, I'm talking about the internet.
4340080	4340920	Yeah.
4340920	4342400	Guys, I'm gonna have to go.
4343720	4344540	Are you coming?
4344540	4347240	I would strongly advise against you going to that meeting.
4347240	4349620	Your uncle is not looking out for your best interests
4349620	4351220	and your career will live beyond this,
4351220	4354080	especially if you're part of the most legendary news story
4354080	4354900	of all time.
4354900	4357360	The movie's happening in this car, Julius.
4357360	4358800	He looks at Cloud Atlas.
4359840	4364840	Hey, hey, I know Tom Hanks is magnetic in that movie.
4365960	4367540	It's one of my favorites,
4367540	4368920	but if you ever want to be the kind of person
4368920	4371080	who produces the next Cloud Atlas
4371080	4375320	or runs City Action News or a national news station,
4375320	4377440	this story is how you get your foot in that door,
4377440	4378440	not your uncle.
4378440	4380040	If he fires you, screw him.
4380040	4381960	I'll give you every recommendation in the world.
4381960	4383520	Ty fangs up.
4383520	4386160	Oh yeah, we kept him on mute for like seven minutes.
4388160	4389000	I don't know, Cal.
4389040	4392160	I think if I'm gonna do this, it's all about who, you know?
4392160	4395560	And I don't want to be like a Snowden or something
4395560	4398400	and get sent off because of the Godel company.
4398400	4399240	I gotta go.
4399240	4402280	And yeah, Julius just kind of looks at Cal and Beck
4402280	4404440	and like Beck looks at Cal.
4404440	4406600	Cal, you know I'm gonna follow you wherever we go,
4406600	4408620	but I think that Julius has a point here.
4408620	4410000	We're going two different ways, Beck.
4410000	4411800	Who you go with is up to you.
4411800	4413640	Julius orders a Uber.
4413640	4415380	Yeah, no, Cal, I'm your cameraman.
4415380	4416560	I'll meet back up with you guys.
4416560	4418400	I'll make sure he doesn't fire you.
4418680	4419600	Julius, don't go.
4419600	4422000	A tear runs down Julius's eye
4422000	4425240	as he waits for the car to stop and gets out.
4425240	4426080	Car's been stopped.
4426080	4429120	He looks at the...
4429120	4430400	What are you waiting for?
4435040	4436280	My Harry Anderson juke.
4436280	4437980	Go on, get out of here.
4440560	4445560	As the credits roll on Cloud Atlas, Julius exits the car.
4446200	4450060	Cal is just like weeping.
4451080	4453040	Julius is crying too.
4453040	4454560	Beck just says to himself,
4454560	4456260	God, I hope he's right about this.
4461000	4464820	Luke, Julius Summers takes the Uber back
4464820	4467380	to the city action news station.
4467380	4468920	You get out and you head in
4468920	4473360	over that marbled, marvelous floor, head upstairs.
4473360	4475040	As you make your way upstairs,
4475360	4478920	you see the door to your Uncle Ty Frailand's office
4478920	4481720	is closed and you hear whistling
4481720	4483520	coming from the other side.
4483520	4488520	When you make it to the door,
4497400	4499040	and when you open up the door,
4499040	4503940	you see standing behind his desk, your Uncle Ty Frailand.
4503940	4508260	And sitting at the two chairs facing Ty's desk,
4508260	4513260	looking back toward you is a tall, mousy police officer
4513500	4518500	wearing glasses and a short, jacked, bald police officer.
4519320	4521160	Two whole new characters.
4524340	4525460	And you recognize who?
4525460	4527740	Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.
4527740	4528900	That's right.
4528900	4530500	Confidently, he says.
4530500	4533220	And how does Julius feel in this moment?
4533340	4535420	Disappointed in himself,
4535420	4540420	yet excited at the prospect of a promotion.
4543720	4544560	Nice.
4548340	4552180	Thomas, Joe, Beck Wilder in Cal, Colorado,
4552180	4554100	head the dream team, if you will,
4554100	4559100	to the Natcher Hole in Cal, Colorado's Mercedes C-Class.
4560460	4561300	And when you pull up-
4561340	4564500	This is the start of some PTPB erotic fan fiction.
4566100	4567500	Oh my God.
4567500	4569140	It is straight for the natural.
4569140	4571680	When we go to the northeast corner.
4574080	4576800	When you head to the northeast corner,
4576800	4579660	you see that there is a subway station there.
4579660	4583280	And from the car, you see walking up
4583280	4586740	out of this subway station at just this moment,
4586740	4591740	with a wall of dark hair flowing down
4591740	4596060	over their eyes, covering their nose,
4596060	4600660	only showing their bottom black lip pierced with a hoop.
4602460	4606980	SG, Stevie Godel.
4606980	4608540	Son of a bitch, Beck.
4608540	4610380	Holy shit, it's Stevie.
4610380	4612580	Cal leans out the window and hawks a horn and goes,
4612660	4613780	Hi Stevie.
4614700	4616460	Beck is waving to you.
4616460	4617300	Over here.
4617300	4619700	Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, it's us.
4619700	4623700	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
4623700	4626540	It's great, and it's all my fault.
4629180	4632760	Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.
4643580	4645500	Cause my life is great.
4647900	4649340	What I meant to say was actually,
4649340	4651020	I feel so seen right now.
4653980	4658100	Cal looks up, and crosses himself and points up.
4659620	4660460	Sammy Sosa.
4660460	4661380	Sammy Sosa.
4661380	4662220	What?
4664300	4665120	Nothing.
4665120	4666960	And it's all my fault.
4672580	4674120	It's all my fault.
