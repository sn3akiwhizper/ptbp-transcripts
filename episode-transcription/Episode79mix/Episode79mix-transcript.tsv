0	3300	Welcome to the Bone Zone, my babies!
3300	6500	It's your sexual guru, Walt the Dog,
6500	14300	and I'm here to make sweet love to the radio airwaves live from 694.2 PTBP,
14300	21200	Contentions' naughtiest radio station for hot Christian singles in your area.
21200	24700	I'm starting to have those weird dreams again, y'all.
24700	27200	The newest batch was wild.
27200	30700	I went to the coffee shop in my dreamland
30700	35100	and proceeded to ask for the oldest and stankiest grounds,
35100	36800	as is my custom.
36800	40500	The coffee attendant denied me my rightful treasures,
40500	43200	so I started shaking them violently.
43200	44600	The head fell off,
44600	49300	and 42 snakes erupted from the hole where the head once was.
49300	54500	The snakes all started chanting in unison and calling me The Reginald.
54500	57100	I cried, but instead of tears,
57100	61200	little tiny baby wolf started pouring out my damn eyes.
61200	64000	All the baby wolf started doing a dance
64000	66800	and raised me up to the damn heavens,
66800	70300	where I proceeded to become a god.
70300	73300	And then my teeth fell out and I had sex with my dad.
73300	75000	Wait, who is my dad?
75000	76800	W-was I even birthed?
76800	79300	If you can interpret anything from these,
79300	81900	please reach out and be my Joseph.
81900	85600	You know your Wolfie loves a coat of many colors.
85600	88700	Seriously, what do these dreams mean?
88700	92600	Tell me at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram,
92600	96300	or tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, why don't you?
96300	100100	Or how about you write us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts
100100	103200	with your analysis of my fancies.
103200	105400	And maybe I'll read it on the show,
105400	110200	like I'm now about to read this five-star review from Ram Oden.
110400	111300	They write,
111300	114700	Flat Earthers believe that we live on a cosmic Frisbee
114700	117200	that God threw at the beginning of time.
117200	120700	I assume Wolf the dog will be there to catch us at the end.
120700	123200	Much love, y'all are delightful.
123200	125400	Thank you so much for putting this out.
125400	128800	I listen to dozens of podcasts and this is one of two
128800	132100	that puts the numbers in me on a weekly basis.
132100	134200	I don't get to play as much as I'd like,
134200	136100	responsibilities and all,
136100	139100	but I'll be handling for the first time this weekend
139100	141700	and you've inspired me to move ahead with it.
141700	145700	Also, we'll be introducing the luck mechanic mashup
145700	149600	into standard Delta Green for a bit more pulp.
149600	151100	I will say again,
151100	154200	I do not know what the fucking internet is
154200	156700	or what the fuck a podcast is,
156700	161000	but I definitely know when someone's being a sweetie to me.
161000	162700	Thank you, Ram Oden.
162700	166100	I hope whatever it is you're doing is fun as hell.
166100	168400	Speaking of fun as hell stuff

243800	247600	the filthiest scenario Delta Green has to offer.
247600	249900	Something, something, something.
249900	251400	It's time for the news.
251400	253600	Turns out Drew wasn't Drew.
253600	255700	Some of y'all were paying attention.
255700	258300	Councilwoman Carrie pages in the body
258300	261300	of Drew Andrews was handcuffed, ankle cuffed
261300	264100	and tossed in the trunk of the red Mitsubishi
264100	266000	where she still resides.
266000	268300	But the car is hidden off the side
268300	271800	of the highway on the outskirts of contention.
271800	275600	These dumb ass ex cops were keen enough eyesight wise
275600	277900	to spot some sort of entry checkpoint
277900	279900	at contention's only exit.
279900	283800	Keith Vigna snuck past a growing grazing gazer
283800	287200	sitting in a dunk tank in the parking lot
287200	291200	of Hotel Motel just watching for something.
291200	294500	But he completely missed Keith Vigna making his way
294500	297200	back to the gang with his treasured McGuffin,
297200	298800	his father's watch.
298800	301400	The whole rest of the episode was these goobers
301400	303900	taking turns wearing this cursed object
303900	305700	and seeing visions.
305700	308400	Well, gear up for more of that.
308400	313100	Then strap down and throw your hands in the air
313100	316500	because it's time for Kudzu with No Backbone.
316500	320500	["No Backbone, No Backbone, No Backbone"]
346700	348900	Hello, all you wolf pups out there,
348900	352700	listeners of this show here on 694.2 PTBP.
352700	354900	Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
354900	358700	I am your handler, your keeper, your GM, your narrator,
358700	361500	your idiot god, Zach.
361500	364500	Thankfully, I am joined today by three of my dearest friends
364500	366900	and three of your dearest player characters.
366900	368200	That's right.
368200	371000	I've got the contention police officers here.
371000	371900	What up?
371900	372700	Yeah, yeah.
375500	376000	That's it.
376000	377500	Thanks for hanging out.
377500	379500	It's been Pretending to Be People.
379500	381200	See you next episode.
381200	383000	Like and subscribe.
383000	385700	It's just like not a lot's going on right now, so.
385700	388000	Yeah, sign up for the Patreon.
388000	391000	No, I mean, what people like about this podcast
391000	393100	is that you get to read between the lines
393100	395000	and kind of draw your own picture.
395000	397400	So this was really a fan service episode.
400100	401500	Giving the people what they want.
401500	404700	It was a little, you know, it's a little over the top,
404700	408800	a little cheesy, but I think the true PTBP fans
408800	411300	are going to love what they just heard.
411300	411800	Yeah.
411800	412300	We're out.
412300	415300	That was episode 79 or 8, whichever one.
415300	416000	Thanks, guys.
416000	417000	Thanks for listening.
417000	418500	79.
418500	420700	We are in 79 now.
420700	421200	Hey.
424000	427300	That's more than I thought we were going to do by like 50.
427300	428600	Yeah.
428600	429200	Yeah.
429200	431100	I'm still having fun, though.
431100	433100	I've been looking forward to it all day.
433100	433700	Ditto.
433700	434300	All day.
434300	437800	If looking forward to it means nervous and scared
437800	439500	the whole time, then yes, I have been
439500	441200	looking forward to it all day.
441200	443600	We'll be fine.
443600	446200	I think everything's going to work out great.
446200	448000	If you want, we could just take it from here.
448000	448500	Oh, yeah.
448500	450900	If you could, I'd love to see that happen.
450900	451400	Yeah.
451400	451900	Cool.
451900	456500	So guys, you're standing in front of the Goo God.
456500	457000	Sure.
457000	457500	OK.
457500	460600	It's actually pronounced Gew God.
460600	462300	Yeah, we're not trying to get fancy here.
462300	464100	Also, this isn't your job anymore.
464100	464600	Oh, shit.
464600	465400	Sorry.
465400	466000	Kick him out.
466000	468000	So what you've deduced is that you just have
468000	470700	to hurt its feelings, and you win.
470700	474500	So if you can say something really hurtful about this Goo.
474500	477300	You're just dang old jiggly is all you are.
477300	481700	Oh, the monster screams in pain.
481700	484700	Hey, Goo, people think that you and I would get along really
484700	485200	well.
485200	489200	Whoa, no.
489200	490800	No.
490800	491500	I'm a loner.
494800	495300	It's working.
495300	496100	It's working, guys.
496100	497600	It looks like what else do you have?
497600	501700	Hey, Goo, this new fella I met over here
501700	503200	says that we look like brothers.
506200	510100	Oh, that's not bad.
510100	511400	He has a crush on you.
511400	516000	Yeah, the Goo apparently thinks Drew is not bad looking, so.
516000	518400	OK, let's actually start.
518400	522000	You guys are really close to winning.
522000	522700	I shoot it.
522700	525200	So we ended the last episode with all three of you
525200	530100	taking turns, putting on this watch, and seeing a vision,
530100	532300	and then the watch slipping off, and then putting it
532300	533300	right on somebody else.
533300	537100	I believe John Lee, Kevin Moore III just slapped it
537100	538400	right on Clark Bishop.
538400	541900	And then they were questioning John Lee.
541900	545200	Pettymore was like, if I put it on again, will it be the same?
545200	547300	But he asked it to the sky or something.
547300	550500	And then Keith Wigner was like, well, I'll just do it.
550500	552900	And so Keith Wigner slapped on the watch.
552900	556600	His eyes come back to reality as the watch slips off
556600	557800	into his other hand.
560700	562100	He won't give up that easy.
562100	565500	It took me so long to catch what you said.
565500	568200	I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head.
568200	569300	That's a DC Talk lyric.
569300	572700	So just a lot of rap, this one, just a lot of rap
572700	574000	lyrics on this one for sure.
574000	577100	So Keith Wigner's got the watch, the throne,
577100	582300	and I need everyone to roll sanity with your dice.
582300	583600	Even me?
583600	586100	All of yas.
586100	590500	It's a 0 slash 1 sanity check.
590500	591100	2.
591100	596900	I got a 30, which means I don't pass.
596900	597700	I rolled a 2.
597700	599100	30 on a 15.
599100	601700	I failed a 68 on a 16.
601700	604600	And 68, what's that look like on your power there?
604600	606500	Yeah, it's above my power.
606500	609500	Well, let's see what happens literally right now
609500	612200	as you lose one sanity, as does Keith Wigner.
612200	614600	Keith Wigner, when this watch pops off,
614600	617400	you just let out a little scream, which
617400	623900	you realize in this moment is the only noise
623900	625700	that you can hear because contention
625700	629700	is wildly quiet compared to the last time you were here.
629700	633100	If you'll remember, last time you heard lots of animals
633100	635700	in the creek and in the ponds and such,
635700	638800	and you can't hear that right now.
638800	641900	All you're hearing is just this, ah, from Keith Wigner
641900	643400	that is echoing.
643400	646200	And then you think it might even bounce off
646200	650600	of that big floating moat and bounce back at you.
650600	653000	It's echoing through contention.
653000	655200	And Clark Bishop.
655200	658100	He sees Keith put that watch on and then take it off, right?
658100	660400	That's where we're standing right now.
660400	664800	I'm going to try and tackle Keith, and I'm yelling,
664800	666200	why would you put it on again?
666200	668100	Why would you put it on again?
668100	670500	Keith, are you trying to put up a little resistance there?
670500	673400	Yeah, I'm going to try to just get out of his way.
673400	673900	OK.
673900	676200	I'm going to, yeah, and I'm going to try to help Keith.
676200	679400	All right, so you can roll to assist,
679400	682500	and it'll give Keith a plus 20 on his roll.
682500	683500	What should I roll on?
683500	686900	Dexterity or unarmed combat or athletics,
686900	690300	whichever one's highest.
690300	692500	Doesn't fail them all, 76.
692500	693800	So what am I rolling?
693800	695500	You're going to roll dodge to get out
695500	700400	of the way against Clark Bishop's unarmed combat.
700400	703900	60 on a 30.
703900	707000	I rolled a 61 on a 70.
707000	709000	I beat you by one, right?
709000	710100	I still failed.
710100	711000	Oh, I got you.
711000	713000	Clark, you can do whatever you want,
713000	718200	but John Lee Pettymore tries to grab on to Keith Vigna
718200	722600	to pull him out of the way and just literally just grab shirt.
722600	725300	You're still wearing the massive polo, I believe?
725300	728100	No, way too big cargo shorts.
728100	728800	Oh, super tight.
728800	730100	The polo's a little too small.
730100	733500	Yeah, and so as you grab his shirt,
733500	736300	it's so tight on his skin, you can't quite.
736300	737300	And Clark Bishop.
737300	739800	I tackle you, and I'm kind of like trying
739800	741900	to pin you maybe to the ground, and I'm
741900	744700	trying to get the watch out of your hand and get it away.
744700	749200	And I'm just like maybe bashing your whole back into the ground.
749200	750700	Why did you put it on again?
750700	752500	Why did you put it on again?
752500	755600	So as Clark Bishop is screaming this and he's on top of you,
755600	759100	I'm going to have you roll an unarmed combat or a strength
759100	763300	to avoid taking some sort of damage here.
763300	765600	Let's see.
765600	767500	OK.
767500	769300	17 on a 65.
769300	773400	So that'll be enough to allow you to cover
773400	775700	the back of your neck and the back of your skull
775700	777400	as he's just hitting you in the ground.
777400	779200	But he does get a hold of the watch,
779300	782100	and he throws it into the grass nearby.
782100	783500	What the fuck is wrong with you?
783500	784700	What are you doing?
784700	785200	I just.
785200	786600	I scramble to get it done.
786600	788600	Knowing that the watch is away and I've pummeled you
788600	792500	into the ground a few times, my eyes kind of relax,
792500	794900	and I stop maybe doing it quite as hard,
794900	798300	but I'm still kind of jostling you.
798300	800200	And then my hands are moving to your chest,
800200	804700	and it's a little more like, I am, I am, I.
804700	807500	And he gets to his feet and goes and kind of walks
807500	809600	away embarrassed, but doesn't say much.
809600	811300	Clark is walking away embarrassed
811300	813200	as Keith is on the ground.
813200	817000	John is standing right next to you all with the watch in hand.
817000	819000	Yeah, he has his back turned to that
819000	821500	after he sees that Clark is settling down
821500	823400	and he puts the watch on.
823400	835800	I knew this episode was just going to be this.
835800	840800	Oh, the watch tent you crave.
840800	843100	Oh, Lottie, Lottie.
843100	844800	Goodbye, my boys.
851700	853900	Hello, Thomas.
853900	855400	Hi, Zach.
855400	860600	Well, the familiar reality channel changing
860600	864700	has still unsettling, but you know what you're getting into,
864700	867200	and you're standing over a man's body,
867200	869200	and he's face down in the dry crack dirt
869200	870500	you've seen him before.
870500	871300	The smell of piss.
871300	871900	Same man.
871900	873300	Yep, same man.
873300	877800	The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air,
877800	880800	and looking down the road to your perceived destination,
880800	884300	you recognize your hometown of contention.
884300	886100	Back to the body on the ground,
886100	889700	your hands are trembling as you roll him over,
889700	894900	a dead man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine,
894900	899200	dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s,
899200	901500	and a trifolded piece of parchment
901500	905600	falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket.
905600	909900	It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company,
909900	913900	and it reads, we is hiring able bodies,
913900	916000	readying untapped sight.
916000	917600	Plenty of work.
917600	918600	Hesitate not.
923300	924600	That's crazy.
924600	927600	If I hadn't accidentally heard the end of the episode
927600	930800	with Luke hearing that, it would have been a big reveal.
938200	941900	John Lee Pettymore III slips this watch off,
941900	943900	and you see Keith Vigna.
943900	945300	What are you doing on the ground?
945300	946400	I had the wind knocked out of me,
946400	948100	so I'm just trying to catch my breath
948100	949500	and slowly get back up.
949500	952500	When Keith is back on his feet, I'll turn him back around.
952500	956400	Keith, I'm sorry.
956400	957400	That watch is freaky.
957400	961000	I don't know why you would willingly just put it back on.
961000	964800	I just needed to get more info, and I got what I needed,
964800	967300	and I look over at John.
967300	970000	You see the watch slipping off his hand,
970000	972300	and he turns around with kind of a wide expression.
972300	975300	Did you see the same thing?
975300	977700	No.
977700	980400	I mean, you remember the dead man and the vision?
980400	981300	Yeah.
981300	983500	This time, a note slipped out of his pocket.
983500	984900	I saw the same thing.
984900	990100	Written in the same crazy grammar as the initial...
990100	991300	Yeah.
991300	994200	We used striking torches.
994200	995300	Hesitate not, that one?
995300	996300	Yes.
996300	998400	Yeah, it had the same sort of thing.
998400	1002800	It had we is and hesitate not.
1002800	1004800	If I wanted to recite that to you,
1004800	1006700	it would sound like this.
1006700	1010100	We is striking when the land gets darkness.
1010100	1012700	Readying torches, hesitate not.
1012700	1014000	I meant the one I just heard.
1014000	1017000	We is hiring able bodies.
1017000	1019400	Readying untapped sight.
1019400	1020900	Plenty of work.
1020900	1022900	Hesitate not.
1022900	1023900	Cool.
1023900	1026700	And you found it on the old-timey guy, too?
1026700	1028300	Yeah, I'm afraid I did.
1028300	1030800	Yeah, I saw that same thing the second time I put it on.
1030800	1031900	Joe, what do you see?
1031900	1032900	Clark, what do you see?
1032900	1035600	And I slapped a watch on his hands.
1035600	1037300	Oh, OK.
1037300	1040300	Are you willing to let that happen?
1040300	1042500	I mean, I think Clark is in a state
1042500	1044400	that he wouldn't be ready for it.
1044400	1046900	He was already apologizing and embarrassed
1046900	1048100	and talking to Keith.
1048100	1049100	Sucker watch.
1055700	1059800	Reality begins to blink and flicker in a now familiar
1059800	1062100	but still unsettling way.
1062100	1065100	And you're standing over a man's body face down
1065100	1066700	in the dry cracked dirt.
1066700	1071100	The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air.
1071100	1075200	And looking down the road to your perceived destination,
1075200	1078000	you recognize your hometown of contention.
1078000	1080300	Back to the body on the ground, your hands
1080300	1084100	are trembling as you roll him over a dead man
1084100	1087600	in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine,
1087700	1091900	dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s.
1091900	1093900	And a trifolded piece of parchment
1093900	1097300	falls out of the deceased man's jacket pocket.
1097300	1101700	It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company.
1101700	1106900	And it reads, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight,
1106900	1109600	plenty of work, hesitate not.
1110600	1112600	All righty.
1112600	1118700	And the watch comes off of Clark Bishop's wrist.
1118700	1121100	I want to catch it and put it on again.
1121100	1131100	All right.
1131100	1133500	Let's see how many of these fucking things Zach prepared.
1133500	1136300	Luke and Joe, take your headphones off.
1136300	1138700	He goes to catch it, and it slips onto his wrist
1138700	1139400	accidentally.
1148200	1151400	All of a sudden, you're looking at Bean's pond.
1151400	1155800	You see Tilde B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards
1155800	1158400	away from you toward the water.
1158400	1161900	She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood
1161900	1165500	pond, and she continues in steadily
1165500	1168500	until the water rises above her head.
1168500	1172400	And when she is gone, the channel of your reality
1172400	1176900	changes, and you are sitting at the bar in a tavern.
1176900	1181600	Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.
1181600	1183900	Your eyes are wild.
1183900	1187600	You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing
1187600	1191800	from the dead body you found on the way into town.
1191800	1194300	The barmaid refills your glass.
1194300	1197600	So you're the new miner in town who wrote ahead
1197600	1199300	looking for a room?
1199300	1201200	You look in the mirror again.
1201200	1202900	You see your reflection.
1202900	1207900	Still, you give a nod to the alewife.
1207900	1211800	Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.
1211800	1213300	Oh, shit.
1218400	1219200	I got chills, baby.
1219200	1220900	You guys have to put this watch on again.
1223800	1224900	This episode sucks.
1234900	1238200	And you guys see?
1238200	1240700	And you guys see?
1240700	1243400	Oh, no.
1243400	1246100	And you guys see the watch slip off of a John Lee Betty
1246100	1248000	more than their sand?
1248000	1250300	And he instantly slaps it on Clark's hand?
1255600	1258300	God damn it!
1258300	1259000	OK, bye.
1259000	1260400	Take your headphones off, Luke.
1260400	1261700	We're playing a closed game.
1271300	1271800	Joe.
1271800	1272700	I love it.
1272700	1273200	Yeah.
1273500	1274000	Ugh.
1276600	1279400	I got to put the same amount of, like, gravitas into each one,
1279400	1280100	right?
1280100	1282700	So we can see your faces with this new method.
1282700	1286300	And Thomas's faces with whatever you were describing was great.
1286300	1289000	You're looking at Bean's pond.
1289000	1292300	You see Tildy B. Mitchell walking slowly
1292300	1296500	backwards away from you toward the water.
1296500	1299700	She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood
1299700	1300700	pond.
1300700	1303300	And as she continues in steadily,
1303300	1306100	the water rises above her head.
1306100	1309500	And when she's gone, the channel of your reality changes,
1309500	1312600	and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern.
1312600	1316600	Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.
1316600	1319100	Your eyes are wild.
1319100	1321900	You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing
1321900	1326400	from the dead body you found on the way into town.
1326400	1329200	The barmaid refills your glass.
1329300	1331600	So you're the new miner in town who
1331600	1333600	rode ahead looking for a room?
1333600	1335500	You look in the mirror again.
1335500	1337100	You see your reflection.
1337100	1340700	Still, you give a nod to the alewife.
1340700	1344300	Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.
1344300	1350700	Oh, holy shit.
1350700	1362300	And you guys see the watch slip off of Clark Bishop's wrist.
1362300	1363300	I look at John.
1363300	1367300	He's just wide-eyed, and he's nodding at you, like, right?
1367300	1368300	Right?
1368300	1370300	What did you guys see?
1370300	1370900	Throw it on him.
1370900	1373100	I slapped it on Keith.
1373100	1373600	God damn it.
1373600	1375200	OK.
1375200	1379100	We should make pretending to be people slap bracelets.
1379100	1380100	We will now, yeah.
1381100	1383700	The watch slap bracelets.
1383700	1385700	Also, we should experiment after this one
1385700	1388100	if, like, if we all hold hands, we can experience
1388100	1389500	these visions at the same time.
1389500	1390300	You know what?
1390300	1391700	I don't have that written anywhere,
1391700	1392900	but it sure would help.
1402300	1403100	All right, Lukey.
1403100	1404900	OK, let's hear it.
1404900	1406900	You're looking at Bean's Pond.
1406900	1410900	You see Tildi B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards away
1410900	1413200	from you toward the water.
1413200	1416100	She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood
1416100	1416900	pond.
1416900	1419400	And as she continues in steadily,
1419400	1422200	the water rises above her head.
1422200	1425300	When she's gone, the channel of your reality changes,
1425300	1427600	and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern.
1427600	1432200	Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.
1432200	1434700	Your eyes, though, are wild.
1434900	1437800	You recognize your thick, hand-stitched clothing
1437800	1441500	from the dead body you found on the way into town.
1441500	1444100	The barmaid refills your glass.
1444100	1447200	So you're the new miner in town who rode ahead
1447200	1448600	looking for a room?
1448600	1450400	You look in the mirror again.
1450400	1452200	You see your reflection.
1452200	1455600	Still, you give a nod to the alewife.
1455600	1458700	Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.
1458700	1459200	Ooh.
1465200	1467200	I take the watch and put it in my pocket.
1471200	1473200	We were binging that watch.
1477200	1479200	Did you guys...
1479200	1481200	Did you guys...
1481200	1483200	Were you guys Silas Cole, too?
1483200	1484200	Yeah.
1484200	1485200	Yeah.
1485200	1487200	That's fucking crazy, right?
1487200	1489200	You want to try it one more time?
1489200	1490200	Kinda.
1490200	1492200	If we all hold hands,
1492200	1495700	do you think we might experience the vision together?
1495700	1497200	I mean, it can't hurt.
1497200	1498700	And I hand the watch over to you
1498700	1501700	and grab your hand and Clark's hand.
1501700	1503700	I grab... I complete the triangle.
1503700	1505700	All right, I'm holding both your hands.
1505700	1507700	Somebody has to put this watch on for me.
1507700	1509700	I put it on his wrist.
1509700	1511700	Just clasp it.
1511700	1512700	Thank you.
1512700	1513700	And then grab his hand.
1513700	1514700	Okay.
1518700	1520700	At the same time,
1521700	1526700	At the same time, all of your realities begin to sort of fade away and warp,
1526700	1528700	and it's dark.
1528700	1532700	You can barely make out the silhouette of a hooded figure
1532700	1537200	lurking in the shadows of this confined space.
1537200	1543200	But light floods in, illuminating a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop,
1543200	1546700	clutching a book made of some sort of uncured leather,
1546700	1549200	blood dripping from its spine.
1549200	1553200	The visibility is due to the opening of this empty tomb.
1553200	1557200	In walks a tall, gaunt creature with translucent skin
1557200	1559700	and stretched out limbs wearing a black suit.
1559700	1566700	Hello, subject 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8.
1566700	1568700	Please give me the book.
1568700	1572200	After a beat, both figures sprint towards each other,
1572200	1573700	only ten feet apart to start,
1573700	1578200	and a blinding light cleanses the interior of this mausoleum
1578200	1583700	before you see Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth
1583700	1587700	carry in the casket of Ari Manstein,
1587700	1593700	set it down gently, exit, and close the door of the tomb behind them.
1599700	1602200	And the three of you step back away from each other.
1602200	1606700	Ah, I mean, I preferred the episodes in the main timeline.
1607700	1609200	That was fine.
1609200	1611200	What the hell does this even mean?
1611200	1613200	I think everybody roll Sanity on that one.
1613200	1614200	Oh, fuck.
1616700	1618200	Seven, hell yeah.
1619700	1621200	Oh my god.
1621200	1622200	What'd you get?
1622200	1623700	An eighty-seven.
1623700	1625700	That's so for my power.
1625700	1627200	I got a one.
1627200	1628200	No way!
1628200	1628700	Yahweh.
1628700	1629700	Hell yeah.
1629700	1631700	Yahweh, our lord.
1631700	1634200	Luke and Thomas, take off your headphones.
1634200	1635700	Oh no.
1636700	1643700	First, lose one Sanity.
1643700	1644700	Did that.
1644700	1646200	I'm at fourteen now.
1646200	1647200	Congrats.
1647200	1648200	Thanks.
1649200	1654700	Clark Bishop, as you back away, you notice that there is ooze that is dripping out of
1654700	1660000	the nose, eyes, and ears, and a little bit out of the mouth of John Lee Pettymore the
1660000	1668500	Thirth and you see that it has somehow wrapped itself around like coming down his arm and
1668500	1673500	it seems to be dripping from both of his hands and looking down you kind of see that it's
1673500	1679500	on your hands too and it's on Keith's hands and you seem to have just been connected just
1679500	1688500	now by this black oily viscous ooze and as you back away it drips off your hands and
1688500	1694500	onto the ground and some of the stuff that's a part of John Lee Pettymore just drips from
1694500	1701000	his face he doesn't seem to notice that it's on him or in him and as it collects on the
1701000	1708500	ground you look down and it begins moving toward you and then you blink and you can't
1708500	1709500	see it anymore.
1709500	1710500	Oh shit.
1710500	1715500	While they're away, can I ask you, can that be part of my reaction to the over the power
1715500	1716500	thing?
1716500	1717500	Yes.
1717500	1720500	But the deal though is that I have to inflict harm on someone so I can't just run away from
1720500	1721500	it, right?
1721500	1722500	Nope.
1722500	1726500	Does it have to be one of them or can I lash out like at the thing that I think is the
1726500	1727500	goo that is no longer there?
1727500	1728500	You can lash out at the thing that's there.
1728500	1729500	Okay.
1729500	1730500	Absolutely.
1730500	1731500	Okay, cool.
1731500	1732500	Yeah.
1732500	1733500	Cool.
1733500	1739500	Uh, yeah, I'm going to rip a piss too.
1739500	1740500	Cool.
1740500	1744500	I'll tell Luke he can come back so we can hang out.
1744500	1750000	They both went to go take a pee, but I didn't want to be alone.
1750000	1751500	I'm going to go pee too then.
1751500	1752500	Fuck.
1752500	1753500	All by myself.
1753500	1754500	Don't want to be all by myself.
1754500	1755500	Hey, here's Thomas.
1755500	1756500	Don't want to be.
1756500	1773000	Hey, Joe, while Zach's not here, tell us what you saw.
1773000	1776960	He just described a real pornographic scene that he had seen earlier today.
1776960	1778500	It wasn't even story related.
1778500	1779500	Wow.
1779500	1780500	Was it good?
1780500	1781500	It was all right.
1781500	1782500	He liked it for sure.
1782500	1783500	The way he described it.
1783500	1784500	Yeah.
1784500	1785500	What brand was it?
1785500	1786500	Genre.
1786500	1789000	I don't know what the...
1789000	1790000	Gucci.
1790000	1791000	It used a lot of inanimate objects.
1791000	1795160	It was, it was odd, but tasteful.
1795160	1798920	The three of you step away from each other and Clark Bishop's eyes widen.
1798920	1803680	Clark is wide eyed, wild, and starts backing away and he starts slapping your guys' hands
1803680	1805480	and then stomping on the ground really hard.
1805480	1806480	It's here.
1806480	1807480	It's here.
1807480	1808480	It's here.
1808480	1809480	It's here.
1809480	1812060	And he's kind of running away and he's pointing at the ground and stomping at the ground and...
1812060	1813060	What is it?
1813060	1814060	What's here?
1814060	1815060	What's here?
1815060	1816060	It's the goo.
1816060	1817060	It's the goo.
1817060	1818060	It's the goo.
1818060	1819060	It's the goo.
1819060	1820060	And he's like stomping around.
1820060	1821060	I can't see it anymore.
1821060	1822060	I can't see it anymore, but it was here.
1822060	1823060	It was on you guys.
1823060	1824060	Wipe yourselves off.
1824060	1825060	Wipe yourselves off.
1825060	1826060	I start spitting on my hands.
1826060	1828240	I see that and I think that's a good idea, so I start doing that.
1828560	1829560	Are we near any water?
1829560	1831560	Let's look.
1831560	1832880	No.
1832880	1838640	So you guys are just east of Hotel Motel on the map of contention here.
1838640	1843780	I see them spitting on themselves or whatever, but I'm like, Clark, you're just freaking
1843780	1844780	out.
1844780	1845780	It's not here.
1845780	1846780	We can't see it.
1846780	1847780	You can't see it anymore.
1847780	1848780	It's fine.
1848780	1849780	We're fine.
1849780	1850780	You guys.
1850780	1851780	You were covered in it.
1851780	1852780	You were covered in it.
1852780	1853780	It was on the ground.
1853780	1854780	It started moving toward me.
1854780	1855780	It started moving toward me.
1856320	1863840	Clark, in life, you're going to be covered in all kinds of goos, just at different times.
1863840	1872220	So I mean, just take a deep breath, wipe yourself off, you know, crack a cold one.
1872220	1873920	That's what we do in convention.
1873920	1874920	Do you have a cold one?
1874920	1875920	Do you have a cold one?
1875920	1876920	We can pour it on ourselves.
1876920	1877920	We can pour it on ourselves.
1877920	1878920	Do you have one?
1878920	1880240	I slip the watch back into my pocket.
1880240	1881240	Thank God.
1881240	1885480	I thought you were going to slip it back on.
1886180	1891380	I mean, we'll keep this for later because it could tell us something, but man, I think
1891380	1893580	we ought to get to the pond.
1893580	1895980	I kind of want to do it one more time.
1895980	1897940	I'm staring at their, like, demeanors.
1897940	1901460	Are they okay now?
1901460	1902940	Yeah.
1902940	1903940	I feel fine.
1903940	1904940	Oh.
1904940	1905940	We were not okay when you saw.
1905940	1906940	Okay.
1906940	1907940	Gotcha.
1907940	1909780	How much sanity do you guys all have, Carious?
1909780	1910780	Fourteen.
1910780	1911780	Twenty-five.
1911780	1914780	Fourteen, twenty-five, and fourteen?
1915080	1916080	I'm at fourteen, yeah.
1916080	1917080	Haha.
1917080	1921400	In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
1921400	1928320	So yeah, you're a Cyclops for sure because twenty-five sanity, you're the kind of person
1928320	1937360	that people walk on eggshells around, but fourteen sanity is more like people are noticing
1937360	1942760	because you're more almost, I mean, you're on your way to being, like, primordial back
1942760	1952660	to a time where beings like us didn't worry about morality.
1952660	1957620	I think we, let's get back to the, do you think we should walk there, get back to the
1957620	1962140	car, or, what do you think?
1962140	1963420	Where is the pond?
1963420	1965860	Oh, right by Maggie Cook's house?
1965860	1968300	Yeah, it's way further south from us.
1968300	1969740	We're pretty far away from it.
1969740	1973760	Well, we parked the car where we parked it because we were gonna come across a big checkpoint,
1973760	1974760	right?
1974760	1975760	Right.
1975760	1976760	Yeah.
1976760	1978600	Is there a way to come into town from, like, the south part?
1978600	1979600	The south part?
1979600	1980600	No.
1980600	1983680	I mean, there's roads that lead south, but, okay.
1983680	1986240	Can we loop around somehow, like backroads and stuff?
1986240	1990760	You could easily loop around and go around backroads, however, at this exact moment,
1990760	1996040	you hear a voice that is coming from just south of you guys.
1996040	1998040	There's a small neighborhood.
1998040	2002660	Did you just see it, Luke?
2002660	2012300	Sorry, I just tagged Luke in an Instagram story, which you should all watch.
2012300	2014780	Oh, that's so stupid.
2014780	2030720	That's great.
2030720	2036960	You were doing it for so long, and I caught you when you started to get normal again.
2036960	2049820	You can go to our Instagram, at pretending pod, or our Twitter, at pretending pod, or
2049820	2056180	our Facebook, pretending to be people, to see that short video of Luke just really getting
2056180	2057180	in there.
2057180	2058180	Behind the scenes during the recording session.
2058180	2061360	You can tell how much I'm just focused in.
2061360	2062360	How clued in.
2062360	2063360	Locked in.
2063360	2064360	Okay.
2064360	2072260	I mentioned before how quiet it was in contention, but you don't even realize, like, when you
2072260	2078880	hear a truck that is close, literally a block away from you guys, it is the loudest thing
2078880	2085580	in your ears currently, is this truck in the distance, and then you hear it, like, pull
2085580	2089000	to a stop, and when it's idling, it's so much louder.
2089000	2091420	This person is not taking care of their truck.
2091420	2095900	When you hear a holler, all right, come on out of there, Randy.
2095900	2100560	We can do this the easy way, or you can disappear.
2100560	2102900	How much worse can it possibly get?
2102900	2104320	You don't want to give daddy a shot?
2104320	2107360	He can go back and fix everything back to normal.
2107360	2109160	We need more bodies, Randy.
2109160	2110160	Oh, shit.
2110160	2113000	It sounds like they got Randy Anx told up in there.
2113000	2118580	They're about to be in a world of shit.
2118580	2121060	Can we recognize the voice?
2121060	2126240	What would be a social, let's have a, is there charisma in this game?
2126240	2128000	How long have we been playing Delta Green?
2128000	2129000	Three years?
2129000	2131000	There is, uh, Persuade and Humant.
2131000	2133000	There is indeed charisma.
2133000	2136800	Oh, charisma is one of the, is that one of the top ones?
2136800	2137800	Yeah.
2137800	2138800	The base stats, yeah.
2138800	2139800	Yeah.
2139800	2140800	Who's got the best charisma?
2140800	2141800	I've got six feet.
2141800	2142800	I have 75.
2142800	2143800	Nice.
2143800	2144800	That'd be Luke.
2144800	2145800	Wait, what the fuck?
2145800	2146800	Keith Wigner.
2146800	2147800	That's how I talk about it.
2147800	2150800	Yeah, you've been roleplaying that really well.
2151800	2155800	I think Keith Wigner is so charismatic personally.
2155800	2157800	Go ahead and roll on that 75.
2157800	2158800	He's no Ron Stampler.
2158800	2159800	Uh, shit.
2159800	2160800	I got a 99.
2160800	2161800	Oh no.
2161800	2162800	What?
2162800	2175800	Yeah, I had to make sure that it didn't say like 80 or zero.
2175800	2177800	It says 99.
2177800	2179800	Okay, well then here's the deal.
2179800	2185800	Luke, uh, Keith Wigner knows exactly who that voice is and it's Terrence Liquor.
2185800	2187800	And you know that Terrence Liquor-
2187800	2190800	From Liquors Liquors?
2190800	2192800	He owns the liquor store, which-
2192800	2193800	Liquors Liquors.
2193800	2197800	It mails envelopes for you.
2197800	2199800	That's Liquors Liquors Liquors.
2199800	2200800	Liquors Liquors Liquors.
2200800	2202800	There's Liquors Kickers, which is the shoe store.
2202800	2207800	At the gas station you can buy a Liquors Snickers.
2207800	2213800	Which is just Snickers from a regular Snickers truck that the Liquors family has like held
2213800	2216800	up and they're selling for 50 cents more.
2216800	2220800	Do they like tape something on to the label to make it different?
2220800	2222800	Uh huh.
2222800	2224800	His stand up is Liquors Bickers.
2224800	2227800	One L over the S N.
2230800	2232800	Okay, what's Terry Liquor doing?
2232800	2233800	Terrence Liquor.
2233800	2235800	What's his middle name?
2235800	2236800	Terrence.
2236800	2237800	Terrence Elizabeth.
2237800	2238800	Yeah.
2238800	2240800	Terrence Elizabeth Liquor.
2240800	2244800	Average height, dirty overalls, boots, trucker hat, long oily hair.
2244800	2247800	Always has a lip packed with chew and the scent of booze on his breath.
2247800	2250800	Oil stained hands and a ripped flannel shirt.
2250800	2252800	Thinks he's smarter than he really is.
2252800	2256800	Prone to flattery, short temper, questionable morals if it'll benefit him.
2256800	2263800	These are the things that Keith Wigner knows because Terrence Liquor and Keith Wigner do not get along.
2263800	2266800	Shout out to B. Crever on our Patreon.
2266800	2272800	This is the first use of an NPC from our patrons at the $10 level.
2272800	2274800	So thank you B. Crever.
2274800	2275800	Super cool.
2275800	2279800	For providing Terrence Liquor to me to murder.
2279800	2288800	So, uh, Luke, Keith Wigner had a run in with Terrence Liquor who's the owner of the Liquors Liquors.
2288800	2291800	I believe it was Liquors.
2291800	2295800	What is this, uh, what is this issue that you guys had?
2295800	2305800	He owes me three $1 bills.
2305800	2307800	They were your lucky dollars.
2307800	2310800	No, he asked him to make change at the register and he...
2310800	2314800	Yeah, he, I gave him a five. He gave me, he gave me two and he...
2314800	2319800	He wanted to give you 12 quarters, but you're like, fuck that, give me a $3 bill.
2319800	2329800	So I gave him a five, he gave me two bucks, shook up my Bud Light, handed it over and said...
2329800	2331800	Fuck you Beans.
2331800	2338800	Beans, Beans, Keith Beans, his only friends are figurines.
2338800	2348800	I was there not as a patron, but to check his liquor license and I wanted a beer at the time so I gave him a five, he gave me two, shook up my beer and...
2348800	2350800	I got beef.
2350800	2355800	Well, it sounds like we just need to apprehend him and we have grounds to do it.
2355800	2363800	When I, when I hear him yelling at Randy Angst, I just put my hand up to the guys and like, listen for a second.
2363800	2370800	I'm like, that's fucking tea liquor. Let's go get his ass.
2370800	2375800	Remember that $3 bill incident? That's him.
2375800	2379800	That guy that shook up your beer? Kevin burst out laughing.
2379800	2383800	John Lee Kevin Moore, just like laughs.
2383800	2393800	I know you're, uh, I know you're sore at this feller, but, uh, should we maybe scout the situation out first, wreck an order, see if we can't go in from behind and help Randy out?
2393800	2397800	If you want to, and I pull my gun out and start walking towards the disturbance.
2397800	2401800	Stay behind the tree line, Keith. Don't lose the element of surprise.
2401800	2406800	Yes. My face is like red and I'm stomping towards the noise.
2406800	2409800	I reach into his pocket, grab the watch and throw it on him.
2409800	2415800	He doesn't.
2415800	2419800	He doesn't.
2419800	2424800	Well, if you're reaching in Keith's pocket, you'll have to go, uh, you'll have to go dexterity.
2424800	2432800	Also, you got to find out which pocket it is in my cargo shorts and they're huge. So pick a pocket, any pocket.
2432800	2441800	You can go criminology. Keith, you're rolling against him with alertness or dexterity or athletics.
2441800	2445800	Okay. I'm going to roll criminology because now that I'm a robot, I'm less dextrous.
2445800	2451800	I got a nine on a 60. I got a 50 on a 50.
2451800	2457800	Well, tell us what happens. You can get the wall. You can get the watch out of his big ass pockets in my imagining.
2457800	2463800	He's so mad at, uh, at tea liquor that he's not really paying attention. I like kind of pay attention to him.
2463800	2468800	I see it happening. And before I can react, his hand is out of my pocket again.
2468800	2475800	And I point up to this guy and I say, look over there. And then I slap it on his hands.
2475800	2479800	Can I try to fight it slapping on my wrist? Yeah.
2479800	2484800	Yeah. It'll be another, uh, either dexterity or athletics.
2484800	2491800	50 on a 50 dexterity. Yep. That seems legit.
2491800	2500800	It is. Look. I don't know if you can even see that. Yeah. Oh wow. That is 50.
2500800	2510800	I can see there's literally no way Luke could have like found exactly on those dice that fast.
2510800	2517800	And Thomas, I assume that you can't beat that. No, I rolled a 24 on a 50. So I guess so I'm, I'm stomping away.
2517800	2523800	Well, that was a, that was a contest for you not to, to somehow make him not put the watch on you. So you get it right.
2524800	2531800	Already too far away. He grabbed it out of my pockets and I'm already, yeah, he's gone.
2531800	2536800	He's, he's walking. You, you're holding the watch. You tried to slap it on his wrist real quick, but he's walking away.
2536800	2541800	I turn around, like really exasperated and give Clark a side, but then I try to sneak it on his wrist.
2541800	2549800	On to my, on to Clark's wrist. Yeah.
2549800	2555800	Yeah. I mean, I would like to contest that at that point. I'm looking at him as it happens.
2555800	2562800	Yep. Dexterity or athletics against each other.
2562800	2566800	No, I rolled a 97.
2566800	2573800	I rolled a 48 on a 60. I'm good. I just, I just, I just slap your hand away.
2573800	2580800	John, John misses again and very like exasperated. Like he just lets out a huge sigh and then slaps it on himself.
2580800	2585800	Yep. All right. Take your headphones off.
2585800	2594800	Well, Thomas, you got me.
2594800	2597800	Did we reach the limits of your preparation?
2597800	2605800	Well, I didn't have like a million things written down for what happens when you put the watch on over and over and over and over again.
2605800	2612800	It's like a whole episode of watchness. So here's what I will tell you.
2613800	2620800	You just want to make it easy on yourself and say the visions start looping. Like you're back to the door.
2620800	2622800	That's not fun. Here's what I'm going to do.
2622800	2626800	I'm going to tell you what happens and then I'm going to go in and rerecord a cool version of it later.
2626800	2630800	Sure, sure, sure. I'll react to what you're saying. Like it's the cool version.
2630800	2634800	Okay, perfect.
2634800	2642800	What a bright flash of light almost makes your eyes feel warm and then you see an abandoned warehouse.
2642800	2651800	Puddles have collected from rain and in them you can see the reflection of the moonlight pouring in through the crack and hole filled roof.
2651800	2660800	Three figures are standing near the wall and the shadows and their silhouette looks like a race podium or dug trio.
2660800	2667800	But the tallest figure looks massive like a human that has been stretched out.
2667800	2679800	Closer you see this lemmy suit clad translucent skinned creature hands a small manila envelope to the two actual humans standing before it.
2679800	2687800	A man and a woman. They open the envelope and inside there's only a small piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol.
2687800	2697800	It is a filled in circle encircled by six circles. Another bright flash of light engulfs your vision and you see James the mill worker.
2697800	2704800	Just James dragging two bodies. This man and woman you just saw across the floor of his house.
2704800	2712800	And then we see these two individuals from above. They're sitting lifeless at the bottom of a small man-made pit.
2712800	2717800	And you see a sort of time lapse of the bodies bloat and change color.
2717800	2722800	And then Clark Bishop falls into this pit and your vision is again consumed by light.
2722800	2733800	As it fades you see Chief Maggie Cook giving orders to a looming overweight man wearing an all black combat uniform.
2733800	2738800	And he has a large scar over his right eye.
2738800	2742800	Okay.
2742800	2748800	Can I just keep putting this watch on and seeing the background of all the mysteries?
2748800	2749800	Yes.
2749800	2755800	I mean I'm going to pitch that to the guys and break your little podcast wide open.
2755800	2758800	Good. We need to answer some questions.
2758800	2762800	But not too many and that's on you.
2768800	2770800	Hello.
2770800	2774800	Zach your shirt is very Star Trek The Next Generation.
2774800	2775800	Thank you.
2775800	2778800	That's Joe's least favorite Star Trek.
2778800	2780800	That was a deadly insult.
2780800	2783800	Would it be better if I had like all the way?
2783800	2789800	The buttons that were laying on your chest made it look like pips from Star Trek. That's what helped the illusion.
2789800	2790800	Oh. Whoops.
2790800	2794800	You forgot about your pips. You forgot about your pips.
2794800	2797800	Lattice.
2797800	2806800	Okay. So. Keith Vigna is just ahead of you guys making his way toward the Confrontation House.
2806800	2808800	Confrontation House. A new reality.
2808800	2810800	Keith House.
2810800	2818800	And Clark Bishop just ripped his hand away from John Lee Pettymore the Third who slapped on the bracelet onto himself.
2818800	2823800	I look wide eyed at you. Did you see something else?
2823800	2826800	Guys. Yeah. I mean. Keith! Keith!
2826800	2832800	We really need to be putting on this like this watch cause we're getting some good shit here.
2832800	2837800	I turn around and look at him and I'm like slowly walking backwards but I'm listening.
2837800	2845800	Well hey like remember when that robot feller attacked us in James the Mill worker's house.
2845800	2847800	You know the first time we met Randy.
2847800	2848800	Yeah.
2848800	2852800	Well so you wanna know why? Cause that's what I just saw.
2852800	2853800	Alright. Get this.
2853800	2855800	Why the robot attacked us?
2855800	2858800	Well why he was there in the first place. Alright check it out.
2858800	2864800	So. Myriad had sent two people out to like intercept James the Mill worker or something.
2864800	2871800	That part wasn't super clear but James dispatched them or came into possession of their bodies somehow.
2871800	2876800	But you know the two dead fellas we found at the bottom of that pit in James's house.
2876800	2878800	Yeah I remember them very well.
2878800	2887800	That was them and Myriad sent them and the next thing I saw was Maggie telling that robot fella to head to James the Mill worker's house.
2887800	2897800	And the impression I got was that it was you know going after those bodies. It might have been to go after us but that might have been a right place wrong time situation.
2897800	2899800	I've stopped in my tracks.
2900800	2906800	Anyway I just like it seemed yeah Maggie she sent the robot fella after us or after James.
2906800	2912800	And yeah it just seems like we get a lot of information every time we put this thing on so.
2912800	2917800	I'm pretty much team watch right now. Formerly team PETA.
2917800	2920800	I mean that's good to know but does it help us right now?
2920800	2932800	Well I mean I don't know if it helps us rescue Randy or beat up that fella that you don't like who made a fool of you with your with your beer.
2932800	2936800	But I remember why I was mad and I start stomping away again.
2940800	2944800	I touch him on the shoulder I'm like hold up hold up there's time for that there's time for that.
2944800	2950800	I don't know I think maybe we should go figure out this situation that that lies ahead of us right now.
2950800	2956800	But it just seems like we could really blow this whole mystery open by just repeatedly putting this watch on.
2956800	2960800	I don't know if you know God ever thought of that when he created such.
2960800	2965800	You mentioned that Maggie was she sent the robot to kill us?
2965800	2970800	She sent the she sent the robot to James the Mill worker's house. I think we just got there at the same time.
2970800	2977800	Oh gotcha gotcha not okay but those two fellas that were in James's pit they was dead myriad fellas.
2977800	2983800	And that robot had the myriad logo on it right? That's where we first found out about myriad.
2983800	2987800	You fell into that pit you didn't find anything on him did you?
2987800	2990800	Did I? Zach is nodding yes I don't remember what I found.
2990800	2995800	Me neither. I just remembered that it stunk down there because they were decomposing.
2996800	2999800	Which seems realistic.
2999800	3005800	You know two days ago when you fell into that pit of bodies did you notice anything strange or were you just horrified?
3007800	3010800	Overwhelmed by the stench of death.
3011800	3019800	One is a man one was a woman they had a piece of paper that had the symbol for the circle of knowledge on it.
3019800	3020800	Huh the cock.
3020800	3023800	Did you find anything on their bodies?
3023800	3025800	Yeah they were circle of knowledge members.
3025800	3027800	Two cocks.
3027800	3029800	That's right I remember.
3029800	3037800	There's one piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol and it was a filled in circle encircled by six circles.
3037800	3039800	Is there a chance I didn't know what it was at the time?
3039800	3042800	Yeah didn't we record that like four years ago?
3043800	3055800	You did so a little backstory refresher here you found that I believe you knew what the logo was.
3055800	3071800	The statue's bow tie flips the coffee table over so when you like touch the statue's bow tie it flipped the coffee table over showing an enormous stash of weapons body armor and a long black plastic tube the size of a baseball bat.
3071800	3083800	And then written in blood where one of the guns should be it said stop her and inside that big tube was a map of calm comfy campground.
3084800	3099800	And then if you'll also remember Gary Daley told you that he saw Maggie and James and a third person going into Chief Maggie Cook's house the night that the home exploded.
3099800	3100800	Yeah.
3100800	3107800	The guy that was with them had a big scar over his eye and he was wearing big black tactical gear.
3107800	3108800	Yep yep yep.
3108800	3109800	Cool.
3109800	3111800	So there's some dots.
3111800	3114800	Y'all like the ice cream of the future?
3114800	3115800	They're fine.
3115800	3117800	I've been dipping into them.
3117800	3121800	I get it I'd rather have ice cream every single time but.
3122800	3124800	Sometimes I'd prefer dipping dots.
3124800	3125800	It's fucking wrong.
3125800	3126800	They stick to your tongue weird.
3126800	3129800	Yeah because they're below zero.
3130800	3131800	I like it.
3131800	3133800	I like how weird it is.
3133800	3135800	Well you know what Keith's doing.
3142800	3143800	Uh okay.
3145800	3148800	That uh I don't think.
3149800	3150800	I don't think you have time.
3150800	3159800	So as you guys are watching Keith Vigna walk off into the distance after John Lee Pettymore the third explains this to you.
3159800	3165800	John and Clark. Clark is at a loss for words. He's trying to put the dots together.
3165800	3166800	Well all I'm saying is.
3166800	3168800	You guys moving or are you letting Keith go by himself?
3168800	3175800	I guess we gotta keep after Keith but uh yeah this watch just does seem like a real handy plot device.
3175800	3178800	Mystery device sorry case device.
3178800	3184800	However you personally wanted to find the situation we've all found ourselves caught up in.
3184800	3190800	John Lee Pettymore kind of has an ongoing narrative of his whole life just running his head at all times.
3190800	3198800	I'm at a loss because Clark would be kind of into the idea that John's proposing that we're hearing we're getting more information every time we put on the watch.
3198800	3203800	Clark would be very intrigued by that prospect but I think he's kind of scared of it too.
3203800	3213800	John I'm actually I'm kind of on board with this idea of exploring the uses of the watch but it I'm telling you I saw last time we put it on.
3213800	3214800	Sure.
3214800	3220800	The ooze it came out of you guys. It came out of you guys. I don't think it's all good. I don't think it's all good.
3220800	3225800	It may even it may even just be showing us something that who knows what it means.
3226800	3234800	None of it's we don't we don't know. And Keith's walking away. I feel like maybe we should take care of what's going on now.
3234800	3242800	Get to a safe spot and then maybe I don't know experiment with it or something. I don't I don't know. I just I think there's a chance it's unsafe.
3242800	3256800	Clark I think I think that's a damn smart point of view. And I was perhaps tempted by this this wrist siren and it and it caused me to lose focus on on what's in front of us.
3256800	3264800	And I think what we got to do now is keep Keith from getting his his damn self killed and we got to go help our friend Randy Angst.
3264800	3269800	For sure. And if you heard a siren I didn't hear that. But yeah we should we should get in there.
3270800	3279800	No I'm saying the watch is a siren. Yeah no I didn't I didn't hear a siren in mind either but we can go on.
3279800	3289800	Keith hold up we're coming. There it is. I look back behind him and I I look ahead of me and I just yell yeah we're coming motherfucker.
3290800	3305800	Okay there it is. So you guys are now coming up around the back of this house and walking up to a chain link fence that is the end of the property of this home.
3305800	3314800	And so coming from the backyard you hear the truck is in the driveway of this home that you're approaching from behind the backyard.
3315800	3322800	And looking through the windows in the back what's the highest alertness in the group? We got a 70. 60. Nice. Yeah.
3322800	3330800	But we're up pretty good. Like we planned on being cop characters. Yeah but what's your law though? 50. I rolled a 90.
3330800	3342800	You guys are looking in the back windows and you know it's got curtains and you can't really see in there's not much movement detected but the lights are on so you can't really tell what's going on.
3342800	3354800	But you hear this truck just idling in the front and you're not sure if tea liquor has made his way into the house yet or if he's still out front. Which approach do you guys want to take?
3354800	3360800	So I'm gonna go around the side of the house and peek then look at his truck and see if he's in there.
3360800	3369800	When I see Keith peeking I'm a little encouraged by his stealthiness. Keith what do you see? Yeah roll stealth Keith.
3370800	3385800	Oh good. What do you have? He has like a 10 right? Shit I got a 14 on a 10. Oh no! You're right there. That's so brutal.
3385800	3394800	You guys haven't passed this stealth check since you've been back to contention. Just a quick reminder that everyone knows. Does anybody have more than 10 stealth? Yes.
3394800	3399800	I got a 30.
3399800	3419800	So I am like trying to peek around the corner but. And you don't notice that there's this concrete drain that moves the water away from the house and you trip over it and you fall onto the driveway like the front corner of the driveway right by the garage.
3419800	3432800	And you look up and you're staring straight at this truck. In the back of the truck you see that there's a tarp slumped over the sides and there's water kind of splashing off.
3432800	3454800	And you see fish kind of like jumping up through it and in the back sitting in the water in this puddle that has been teemed you see an older man who has like super long hair and hippy dippy and you recognize him as manager of Subtropolis Jimmy Sanders.
3455800	3466800	How familiar are we with Jimmy? Yeah how did he feel about us before all this went down? Well it's your cousin isn't it? Yeah. He was the one who called in the oil spill. And he was older than me right? Yes.
3466800	3479800	So he's probably going to recognize John Lee Pettymore the third. Oh fuck I didn't even think about that. He would have been alive before. I'm picturing since we didn't break away I'm just picturing Clark and John have like moved up into position around the side of the house.
3479800	3489800	Oh no no I know that but I mean if he were to suddenly see John. Absolutely no I'm glad because he would have turned around and was like it's Jimmy Sanders it's your cousin exactly.
3489800	3504800	Wait to clarify real fast and I don't know if this puts you on the spot or not but is Jimmy Sanders your dad's brother's kid or sister's I guess? Or sister's or yeah or anywhere in there I feel like no matter by marriage or blood everybody would have been to the same barbecues.
3504800	3518800	And also Pettymores just call each other cousins at a certain point and like non Pettymores who are still blood related like they're all just cousins. Oh right he's got a different last name so he would have to be his sister's kid.
3518800	3529800	That's what I was trying to decipher that makes sense. So he would be John the third's nephew. So does he see me? It's not necessarily that he sees you as much as he sees everything.
3529800	3553800	So you're looking at this dude and his eyes are wide and wild and he's just like sniffing around he's like number four with the no tomato no tomato no tomato extra cream cheese and he's just like looking around all over the place and you think he might have seen you but he didn't like he couldn't tell.
3553800	3568800	As soon as I get up I turn around to John I'm like it's your cousin and then I go and I want to get the keys out of the truck. Yeah so I'll go to cover you while you do that. I'll go to get Jimmy's attention while you're slipping around to grab the keys.
3568800	3585800	I think Clark is still trying to peek into the windows at the corner here trying to get a better look through. So as Keith sneaks out John wants to just like really visibly pop out and he goes Jimmy hey there kiddo do you remember me?
3585800	3608800	Hey number four lettuce no extra cucumber but I can't cut it in half right now. And he's like miming actually making a sandwich. Running with that he's like oh yeah give me that number four why don't you go ahead and start making that for me and I don't it doesn't have to be cut in half you just get to it and I want to see what he does.
3608800	3628800	And then he looks up at you and as he makes direct eye contact with you his eyes enlarge to the size of saucers and he just lets out a little and then dives directly into the water Keith just walks up opens the car door what are you doing?
3628800	3640800	The keys are in the ignition the car is running truck is running. Oh are you talking to me? No I was talking to Keith Vigna is he available? Sorry. Well from my screen it looked like you were looking at Joe but anyway.
3645800	3656800	You guys were at 45 and not 90? Yeah you should be looking up to talk to me. You weren't effectively Brady bunching those calls.
3657800	3665800	Yeah I just open the door I get the keys turn the truck off and stick them in one of my pockets and I zip the pocket up.
3666800	3688800	Clark Bishop you are looking inside this house Terence liquor is standing oil stained hands ripped flannel shirt long oily hair underneath a trucker cap he's got some dirty overalls and boots and he's standing in like the living room of this house where you see Randy Angst.
3688800	3704800	He is wearing a fancy blue three-piece suit you can't tell it's a three-piece suit though because he is being shoved face into the carpet by Terence or not. Not Terence. Oh shit.
3704800	3727800	This dude is burly as fuck he is five foot four so he looks super wide it's in his mid-30s and he's got short cropped black hair blue eyes and impeccably white teeth and he's wearing a gray sweatsuit a black beanie and chucks so exactly the rocky uniform like when he's running up the where is that?
3728800	3740800	Washington D.C. Philadelphia. When he's running up to Kiss. He's climbing up the Washington Monument. To make the Liberty Bell whole again and that's what he's wearing that's what he looks like.
3740800	3765800	There's this burly thick short dude who has his knee on the back of Randy Angst's neck and he is shoving Randy's face into the carpet and then you hear the truck stop running they hear the truck stop running and they look up well seems like we've got some company.
3770800	3796800	What's up everybody I'm Zach and I just wanted to pop in at the end here and holler a few things at y'all first sorry this episode was so so so late I absolutely love making this show but it takes an absurd amount of time and I've been running low on steam.
