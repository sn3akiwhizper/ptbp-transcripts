00:00.000 --> 00:09.720
Knock, knock. Who's there? It's me, Wolf. Wolf who? It's Wolf the dog. Well, I don't

00:09.720 --> 00:16.240
know you. Well, you're about to, baby. Open the damn door of your mind and let me in to

00:16.240 --> 00:23.100
feast upon your brain energy. Y'all know I'm here and devouring all wave-based energies

00:23.100 --> 00:35.540
in my path live from 694.2 PTBP. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Agent Sean McFarland.

00:35.540 --> 00:42.940
He writes, Mr. Wolf the dog, be advised that you are currently violating section 301 of

00:42.940 --> 00:49.560
the Communications Act regarding your broadcast of a pirate radio signal. The response team

00:49.560 --> 00:54.000
has been dispatched and are authorized to sanction any and all participants in this

00:54.000 --> 01:02.320
signal up to and including incarceration, discorporealization, and dimensional shunting.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.520
Your broadcast must be ceased immediately in the area known as The City to avoid these

01:08.520 --> 01:15.800
measures. Your compliance is mandatory. You cannot escape us. Abandon all hope, your friends

01:15.800 --> 01:26.360
at the FCC. Hahaha. Uh, FCC, huh? What does that even stand for? No one could possibly

01:26.360 --> 01:33.600
know. Probably some fake mumbo jumbo just to scare me into exile. But, uh, that never

01:33.600 --> 01:38.820
happened. I just, uh, gotta pack a few things real quick. Remember, if you wanna write up

01:38.820 --> 01:44.480
something for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople

01:44.480 --> 01:52.160
on Facebook, or write a 5 star review on iTunes and email us at PretendingPod at gmail.com.

01:52.160 --> 01:57.920
If you want this show to grow and not plateau, you know you gotta crow like an impresario

01:57.920 --> 02:03.960
with the flow of Bordeaux and show every Joe Blow what's good on the radio. Something,

02:03.960 --> 02:09.360
something dildo. But seriously, type about me on the internet. It gives a wolfie the

02:09.360 --> 02:15.600
strength he needs. Y'all, we had a little contest slash giveaway over on the subreddit

02:15.600 --> 02:22.200
at r slash PretendingToBePeople. Huge shout out to user Totoro's Bang Bus on Reddit for

02:22.200 --> 02:28.460
supplying two D&D 5th edition starter sets and a bunch of dice to give away. The first

02:28.460 --> 02:34.000
winner here will receive one of those D&D 5th edition starter sets and five sets of

02:34.000 --> 02:42.880
dice. And that lucky listener is user Curry Chicken Salad. Let's see, oh hell yeah, they

02:42.880 --> 02:47.980
drew the page in the leather bound book found at Jim Cook's house. It is only through death

02:47.980 --> 02:54.000
that he may rise again. The second winner will receive the other D&D 5th edition starter

02:54.000 --> 03:00.720
set, five sets of dice, and a box of D&D dungeon tiles. Luke claims he touched these tiles

03:00.720 --> 03:12.640
so hard. And all that is going to user AnonAnonono. Oh, this dirty motherfucker right here wrote

03:12.640 --> 03:19.200
that fanfic that physically shipped Joe and Clark Bishop. Jesus, man. Seriously, y'all.

03:19.200 --> 03:24.520
Go read that delicious slop if you haven't yet. It should be canon. And that leaves us

03:24.520 --> 03:30.120
with the final winner, the contest winner. Now, this shit ain't random. The boys picked

03:30.160 --> 03:35.520
the favorite entry, and they are proud to present a hardback slip case set of Delta

03:35.520 --> 03:44.280
Green, the role playing game two user SM Farlander. I have a note here from my producer. This

03:44.280 --> 03:49.880
absolutely stellar piece of art made my heart beat out of my chest. The attention to detail,

03:49.880 --> 03:54.800
especially the Polaroids in the background, blew me away and made the immense amount of

03:54.800 --> 04:00.280
time I put into this show feel worth it. Seriously. Thank you. All right, y'all. That's

04:00.280 --> 04:06.880
all well and good, but let's focus now. Fuck the news. The halftime show is just finishing

04:06.880 --> 04:13.880
up and taking us directly into the heart of the scrap pit is kudzu with no back bone.

04:36.880 --> 04:54.280
The jam. Come on and slam if you want to jam. Work that body, work that body, make

04:54.280 --> 04:59.280
sure you don't hurt nobody. Get back, lose your mind. Shake it, break it. Overtime. Hey,

04:59.280 --> 05:04.280
DJ. Turn it up. UCD, you're gonna burn it up. Come on, come on, let's unfold. Say whoop.

05:04.280 --> 05:14.240
There it is. And welcome back to the scrap pit after that incredible halftime show from

05:14.240 --> 05:19.460
Mary Nightingale and the senior citizens. We appreciate your efforts and contributions

05:19.460 --> 05:25.120
to this society here, Mary, and we appreciate everything you've done for the family and

05:25.120 --> 05:32.640
the science. And we are back looking at the massive fight between Planet Juggernaut versus

05:32.640 --> 05:39.120
Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, and Friends, which is just now turned into at friends. What do we think,

05:39.120 --> 05:43.960
Big? This has been a whirlwind. Not as big as a bloodbath as I was expecting, but I am

05:43.960 --> 05:50.880
still quite sated by what I've seen. Six times four rounds. We are 24 seconds into this fight

05:50.880 --> 05:58.280
and boy, howdy. Has it been crazy? But you are right. Traditionally, most contestants

05:58.280 --> 06:03.400
do not make it past the second round here where they are stuck in the pit, in the scrap pit with

06:03.400 --> 06:10.800
Planet Juggernaut. Taking him down to the floor. Yeah, Clark Bishop. All right, Clark Bishop,

06:10.800 --> 06:18.200
you're first. Last we left off, Planet Juggernaut was doing this rolling attack. Has he come to a

06:18.200 --> 06:23.480
stop or is he still rolling around the arena? He was rolling around, but would you rather be still

06:23.480 --> 06:30.040
attached or would you rather be not attached to him with your hands up in him? I would rather be

06:30.040 --> 06:36.360
not attached. Okay, then roll Sanity to decide if you are. Having almost died and being flung

06:36.360 --> 06:42.200
about while still attached to this Planet Juggernaut has led you to rethink some things.

06:42.200 --> 06:48.360
Maybe you're not a god, but maybe that death magic. That's a failure over my fucking power.

06:48.440 --> 06:55.880
All right. That's what I like to see. Go ahead and roll a d4 for me for almost dying.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.080
That's a one. All right, you're only going to lose one Sanity. What's that put you at, five?

07:01.080 --> 07:08.280
I'm at five. Boy, howdy. And in your state of rage, it's hard for me not to jump into,

07:08.280 --> 07:14.360
and in your state of rage, it's my default voice now. Theoretically, Planet Juggernaut is the

07:14.360 --> 07:19.640
closest to me at this point. Theoretically, that is correct. So I'm going to try and wail on him

07:19.640 --> 07:27.000
with my craziness, with my disorder. I don't really have much left up my sleeve. Oh, I've

07:27.000 --> 07:32.680
still got a sniper rifle I haven't used yet. I'm going to pull that out. Awesome. It's got armor

07:32.680 --> 07:39.080
piercing bullets. It's real high powered. My hope is to rip a hole through the son of a bitch. Okay,

07:39.080 --> 07:44.120
so as you go to make this attack, I'm going to need you to roll a Constitution because

07:44.120 --> 07:53.000
inside this dome, we can call it like a biosphere now because wind begins to whip about and form

07:53.000 --> 07:59.560
a slight tornado in the corner and it is moving through toward you. It's picked up

08:00.920 --> 08:13.640
some of Oz Mayhem Wolf's leftovers. Joe just showed us some of his leftovers.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.440
He did a human spit take there. No water involved. No drink necessary.

08:21.560 --> 08:29.160
Just spit on your lip and I'm ready to go. All right, so you will need to roll a Constitution

08:29.160 --> 08:35.160
here in order to hold on to your sniper rifle as this high powered wind velocity

08:35.160 --> 08:41.400
is raging toward you. That's a pass. So you hold on strong and fire your firearm.

08:42.280 --> 08:49.400
A dodge is not necessary because it's impossible to dodge bullets. I pass this one a 34 on an 80.

08:49.400 --> 08:57.560
All right, high powered sniper is going to be 2d10 damage. Nice. That's a 10, right? Yeah. Oh,

08:57.560 --> 09:06.680
yeah. So 17. Planet Juggernaut takes 17 damage as these rounds just pierce.

09:06.680 --> 09:16.040
You actually, a couple of them fly through and they're through and throughs and they fly through

09:16.040 --> 09:22.600
the other side and hit the dome. And once again, you feel the dome, it like takes the energy and

09:22.600 --> 09:27.720
disperses it through the entire dome and the ground that you're standing on. So you all feel

09:27.720 --> 09:34.920
this tremble and it actually knocks Keith Vigna loose from the dome. Like I meant to do, of course.

09:34.920 --> 09:41.400
Exactly. Keith Vigna, it's not your turn, but I'm going to have you go ahead and roll a

09:41.400 --> 09:47.240
dexterity or athletics to fall gracefully instead of hurting yourself. Do we see anything in the

09:47.240 --> 09:55.960
through and through? Oh no, I fail. Okay. So you are, you're going to take a d6 of falling damage.

09:56.680 --> 10:04.920
That's five. And you fall right on your back and much like the upside down of a belly flop.

10:07.880 --> 10:13.000
Joe, you asked about the through and through of the bullets and looking through, you just see

10:13.000 --> 10:21.880
wires and mechanical bits in the very small holes that have been gauged through this massive orb,

10:22.600 --> 10:29.640
machine planet, even of juggernaut proportions. God, it was John was here.

10:34.600 --> 10:43.640
Thomas, is there any activity in Marvin glasses booth? Go ahead and roll a 50 50 shot. I'm a

10:43.640 --> 10:51.640
giant robot 57. So you wanted me to roll over 50 right? I wanted you to roll over 50 and you

10:52.600 --> 11:04.680
the curtains in Marvin glasses booth began rustling much like Jimmy's old school. I mean,

11:06.200 --> 11:10.920
you know that the brand of curtains are Jimmy's curtains and boy, howdy. Are they just wrestling

11:10.920 --> 11:16.600
about? Interesting. Okay. How close am I to either of them? Close enough. I want to try to grab and

11:16.600 --> 11:22.600
pick them both up. Okay. Uh, so we'll do an unarmed competition between each of them

11:22.600 --> 11:27.640
individually. And because you have two actions, typically you don't take a negative on either of

11:27.640 --> 11:32.760
those attacks. So what are, what are we rolling? We're rolling unarmed, unarmed combat against

11:33.720 --> 11:43.960
my fighting. Yes. I pass with a 19. Yeah. I fail with a 96. Okay. I pass with a 14. So that,

11:43.960 --> 11:49.240
that means I miss Keith, but you grab a hold of Clark Bishop. What do you, uh,

11:53.080 --> 11:59.320
Clark Bishop is being held in the, what kind of, uh, like finger arm hands are we dealing with

11:59.320 --> 12:05.640
here with planet juggernaut Thomas? Just fucking giant, like extendo arms and then big comical,

12:05.640 --> 12:14.200
like Disney gloves. Go, go gadget Mickey gloves. We were on the same wavelength for that.

12:14.200 --> 12:21.160
So we're talking four fingers here, four fingers, um, the black lines over each finger.

12:21.960 --> 12:33.080
Uh, so I bring Clark up to me, up to my laser eyes and, and planet juggernaut tries to speak.

12:33.080 --> 12:39.640
Awesome. Can planet juggernaut speak? Yeah, but make it weird.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.840
From within the depths of this saying, you just hear

12:48.840 --> 12:55.560
it's me. It's John. I don't want to fight you.

12:56.360 --> 13:02.360
We've got to find a way out of here and into Marvin Glass's booth.

13:04.040 --> 13:09.160
Can we kill them together? It's almost turning into Mickey Mouse.

13:10.520 --> 13:16.040
No, you want to hear Mickey Mouse. That's Mickey Mouse. You don't know what the fuck

13:16.040 --> 13:23.720
Mickey sounds like. Hey everybody, let's kill Marvin Glass. No, I sounded like this.

13:24.440 --> 13:29.240
Exactly. Like Mickey Mouse. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. My earphones are turned up to high pitch or

13:29.240 --> 13:35.320
something. Okay. Planet juggernaut takes his turn. You want to eat my ass?

13:39.480 --> 13:48.680
Okay. Keith Vigna, you fell on your back and it hurt. Yeah. Um, and you hear, uh, out of the

13:48.680 --> 13:56.440
corner of your ear, this noise from the depths of the big ball. I don't know if at his distance,

13:56.440 --> 14:04.680
he hears anything other than creaking metal, like weirdness. I love it. Yeah. I get up,

14:04.680 --> 14:14.840
Keith gets up and, um, he looks over at them and in his paranoia, he links juggernaut talking

14:14.840 --> 14:23.240
to Clark as them working together against me. So I set up, I set up my 50 cal mounted machine gun

14:23.240 --> 14:31.000
and just let loose at both of them. Incredible. So here's what we're going to do. First off,

14:31.000 --> 14:38.360
the tornado that is flying through the scrap pit currently is going to try to offset.

14:39.080 --> 14:47.880
Thank you. Oh man. We're not in Kansas anymore. It's an unseasonably warm night in contention.

14:49.240 --> 14:55.080
The tornado is coming for you. You got to roll a constitution check to hold steady in this moment.

14:55.080 --> 15:01.560
Can I, uh, add a little bit to use my suction gloves onto the ground and my mounted machine

15:01.560 --> 15:07.880
gun? Give yourself a plus 40. Then I win. That gives me 110. All right. With 110. See if you

15:07.880 --> 15:18.680
crit. Oh, that's true. See if you crit. I crit succeed. You're very stuck. So you're so,

15:18.680 --> 15:27.240
you're so stuck into the ground that I will give you a plus 40% to your firearms check. But since

15:27.240 --> 15:32.280
you're firing at both of them, it would be a negative 40 to fire both of them. So it'll even

15:32.280 --> 15:37.800
out to shoot at both of them. And it's going to be one roll up and down to hit both together.

15:41.080 --> 15:45.800
It's a 90. That's a 99 again. So that is a crit fail.

15:45.800 --> 15:55.640
Wow. That's two 99 in a row. Yeah. From, from the Prince to the, to the popper place. Uh, you,

15:55.640 --> 16:01.240
you boy, you, you just can't, can't seem to do this. What, what do you, uh, what do you think?

16:02.760 --> 16:09.880
Uh, so I unsuction, oh no, I'm still suctioned down with one hand. I grab the mounted machine

16:09.880 --> 16:15.160
gun with my other hand, but the force of it is so powerful. I definitely needed two hands to

16:15.160 --> 16:19.800
shoot this. And it just starts kind of spinning around and just hitting the walls and like kind

16:19.800 --> 16:25.240
of gets near them, but by no means would it be hitting them. So with a critical failure on that,

16:25.240 --> 16:30.120
even though you critically succeeded on the strength to hold down, I'm going to say that

16:30.120 --> 16:36.920
while you fire and it's wagging about all over the place, you yourself lose control of your own

16:36.920 --> 16:45.960
suctions and get swept away in this tornado as your gun stays put on the ground, along with

16:45.960 --> 16:57.560
your shoes. Oh no, my shoe. And you are currently flying through the air, limbs akimbo, shoes missing

16:57.560 --> 17:05.880
and everyone can see that burned on the bottom of your left foot is the name Maggie. As the tornado

17:05.880 --> 17:13.720
whips you about in the scrap pit. And that is the end of round five here at the scrap pit. We had

17:13.720 --> 17:21.160
a hell of a round this time. The old tornado came out to play and Clark Bishop was able to hold on

17:21.160 --> 17:27.800
dear Lord tightly and he snipes away, landing a couple shots all the way through planet juggernaut,

17:27.800 --> 17:34.280
but he was quick to turn and pick up Clark Bishop straight off the ground. What do we think about

17:34.280 --> 17:39.720
all that? Dick, Nickles, Dick, Nickles. You know, Clark Bishop, a reported victim of death magic

17:39.720 --> 17:45.640
has flung himself into quite a frenzy. Any rifle at our best friend planet juggernaut, perhaps he

17:45.640 --> 17:50.440
wants robot blood to fill his tummy with. What do you think they were talking about out there? They

17:50.440 --> 17:56.120
seem to have some sort of low vibrating communication going on. Yeah, you know, it's crazy.

17:56.120 --> 18:01.960
I've never seen planet juggernaut try to talk before. Did you hear him talking? I heard something

18:01.960 --> 18:08.680
that made my nuts feel weird. It vibrated both at a certain frequency that I have yet to find in

18:08.680 --> 18:13.720
this world that I am going to look on the internet to find that out later. You know, it sounded like

18:13.720 --> 18:20.200
a crying refrigerator to me. I don't know about you. I hate when my refrigerator's sad. And when

18:20.200 --> 18:26.440
moving on, we see Keith Vigna falls off from his safe place up on the top of the dome and he falls

18:26.440 --> 18:32.600
straight on his back, immediately slamming his gun into position. But he loses that right off

18:32.600 --> 18:37.640
the bat as the tornado sweeps him away and leaving his shoes stuck to the floor. You know, it's crazy

18:37.640 --> 18:43.240
to me. Everyone keeps losing their shoes here. I haven't seen so many shoes lost in one match before.

18:43.320 --> 18:47.880
Can no one stay shooed? We'll find out later.

18:53.640 --> 19:01.400
But first, let's jump to our regular segment here in the scrap pit. Let's get some fighting pro

19:01.400 --> 19:08.600
tips from Alfred and Jermaine Glass. I believe we have a pre-recorded session for tonight. Oh,

19:08.600 --> 19:13.560
wait. Nope. I'm hearing that it's up for some reason. We're getting the live feed here. Oh,

19:13.560 --> 19:22.600
and we see the video screen on the, uh, the giant jumbotron is just a video shot of a dark room with

19:22.600 --> 19:29.640
a single light on it. And you see a young man in the shadows of the room who has just cradled

19:29.640 --> 19:33.320
himself into the fetal position and he's rocking back and forth.

19:34.200 --> 19:42.360
A gun. Some sort of gun. He disappeared. It came after him. It came after him and it disappeared.

19:43.080 --> 19:47.080
He didn't have a chance in the gun. The gun disappeared. I mean, one disappeared,

19:47.080 --> 19:50.680
the other disappeared. Why didn't I disappear? If I don't disappear, where's the girl? The

19:50.680 --> 19:55.480
girl came in. I just, I don't know what to, I don't, it's the gun. It's the gun. Oh,

19:55.480 --> 20:01.000
boy. Howdy. Thank you for that. Alfred, we seem to have gotten a weird connection there

20:01.000 --> 20:04.600
from Alfred Glass. Those are bad. I don't think we got any fighting pro tips there,

20:04.600 --> 20:09.880
did we Dick? No, I don't think so at all. He seemed a man possessed by something to me.

20:09.880 --> 20:17.080
If you yourself are in the scrap pit, I would not suggest rolling up in a fetal position. All right,

20:17.080 --> 20:21.960
let's get back into the fight with the top of the round. So we got Clark Bishop at the top of round

20:21.960 --> 20:28.120
six. Clark is wide-eyed having heard this mechanical planet juggernaut beast speaking

20:28.120 --> 20:32.120
to him and claiming to be John. But this isn't the first time that he's had somebody who doesn't

20:32.120 --> 20:38.600
look like John tell him he's John. So he's all ears. Roll sanity for me. John is always around

20:38.600 --> 20:49.000
you, Clark. What am I rolling? Oh, sanity. Fuck. Oh, my God. So fucking close. It's a seven on a

20:49.000 --> 20:56.520
five. Damn, dude. You were right there. All right. Well, you're going to take a D4 of sanity damage

20:56.520 --> 21:08.680
here. What? No. Oh, good. It's four. Oh, my God. I've got one sanity. Look out, world. Clark Bishop

21:08.680 --> 21:16.520
is fucking losing his mind. It's fine with me. It sucks, but it's fine. But Clark, having lost

21:16.520 --> 21:21.880
all the sanity, he is convinced. He didn't need much to believe that this is John talking to him

21:21.880 --> 21:27.480
now. So I want to stand on the palm of the hand that I've been gripped in and I'm raising my

21:27.480 --> 21:34.920
hands up to where I think Planet Juggernaut's eyes and face are. John, you're you're you're in there.

21:35.720 --> 21:47.720
It's really me, buddy. You got you got to help us. You look like you're losing your mind.

21:52.520 --> 21:56.120
Maybe Clark probably starts like babbling at this point, like half listening to you

21:56.760 --> 22:06.680
and losing his mind. But there's Keith and there's a tornado.

22:09.240 --> 22:14.120
Don't worry about what happens to Keith. Let's just kill Marvin Blass.

22:15.080 --> 22:22.120
And with that, it is Planet Juggernaut's turn. Go ahead and roll a fifty fifty shot here,

22:22.920 --> 22:27.160
depending on whether or not you roll lower or higher. We'll see what you're trying to roll.

22:28.120 --> 22:32.280
That was a joke about last time. Twenty five. Congratulations. That's a success.

22:33.160 --> 22:40.040
Okay. What was I rolling for? Planet Juggernaut, you have these, like I said earlier, Oz Mayhem

22:40.040 --> 22:47.560
Wolf had this visor on his helmet that made it hard for you to track his movements. So I'm

22:47.560 --> 22:56.680
picturing like full blown like robot vision for you and your robot vision as you're talking to

22:56.680 --> 23:02.440
Clark Bishop, who's standing in the palm of your hand, blinks in the crowd and you see that there's

23:02.440 --> 23:08.680
specific movement and you actually you see a young, bald, fit man with sunken, intense eyes

23:08.680 --> 23:15.320
wearing a black T-shirt and jeans. And he is walking through the crowd and he is heading

23:15.320 --> 23:22.440
directly for an exit that is nearby Marvin Glass's box. That's all. It's your turn.

23:22.440 --> 23:28.680
Planet Juggernaut looks at Joe and he's like, it'll be fine, buddy. And they hover off.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.400
It's Joe! They hover off.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.040
I didn't say Joe. You're going crazy.

23:39.320 --> 23:45.800
So we hover off towards the part of the dome that the box is behind and I gently set Clark

23:45.800 --> 23:53.320
down on the ground and then I just reel both robot fists back and I want to smash the wall.

23:53.320 --> 23:58.520
Roll strength for me. That's a pass. I have 315 strength.

24:00.440 --> 24:08.040
We found the giant robot rule spec out from Pulp Cthulhu and we're using some of those

24:08.040 --> 24:11.480
stats for Planet Juggernaut. I have 315, so.

24:11.480 --> 24:15.320
Yeah, just roll an up and down check there. Let's see if you critically succeed here.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.640
Oh, 60. Oh, 69!

24:24.920 --> 24:27.000
House rules, baby. That's fucking gorgeous.

24:27.000 --> 24:39.560
Thomas, Planet Juggernaut reaches out its arms and pulls them back to get as much momentum

24:40.120 --> 24:50.600
as Donkey Kongingly possible. And as it swings forward and pounds its giant mechanical Mickey

24:50.600 --> 25:00.360
Mouse pants into the dome, your hands, they like stick immediately. You feel like the adhesive

25:00.360 --> 25:10.120
from the dome, but they power through and the entire dome slowly creaks and the whole thing

25:10.120 --> 25:17.320
splinters like a spider on a spider web. If you'll let me describe something real quick.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.560
I would love for you to describe something real quick.

25:19.560 --> 25:26.520
Before the place just erupts in terrified screams, there is a dead silence as people

25:26.520 --> 25:30.440
see this thing crack, but you hear the loudest woo.

25:30.440 --> 25:45.720
Yes, my boy! Planet Juggernaut! Woo!

25:45.720 --> 25:50.680
This guy, the trip from Akron was worth it for a day.

25:50.680 --> 26:01.080
And the entire dome shatters into this strange dust that just floats down. Okay,

26:01.080 --> 26:06.840
so my favorite fireworks are the ones that go boom. And then as it like comes up,

26:06.840 --> 26:14.200
you don't really see it. And then you hear just like boom. And then there's a giant round. It's

26:14.200 --> 26:18.840
all like the gold. Oh yeah. And it's like pop rocks. I know the boys you mean. Like weeping

26:18.840 --> 26:24.040
willows. Yes. And then it just like, oh, and then it comes. And that's exactly what this dome looks

26:24.040 --> 26:33.320
like as it pours down. And people start losing their fucking minds. But rounds are only six

26:33.320 --> 26:38.520
seconds. So we've got time. Keith Vigno, you're up. What are you doing? As soon as this happens,

26:38.520 --> 26:42.840
Keith's first thought after he had been sucked up into the tornado was that that was my only

26:42.840 --> 26:49.480
chance to get rid of my two enemies now. So now that I'm surrounded by bloodthirsty people,

26:49.480 --> 26:56.040
I'm aiming my nitro thrower just at everybody in the arena around me and just like

26:56.040 --> 27:05.240
blasting them with it. And in an attempt to freeze people so I can escape. Roll firearms.

27:07.640 --> 27:10.360
That's a pass. How many people do you want to hurt?

27:10.360 --> 27:20.280
So how many people are in this arena completely? What did you roll on the dice? A 37. You

27:20.280 --> 27:27.160
37 people get frozen solid as they're like trying to make their honestly they're just really scared

27:27.160 --> 27:34.760
and trying to like leave and you make fucking damn sure that they can't. Yep. That's what I do.

27:34.760 --> 27:44.600
All right, that's the end of round six. And what a so horrifying round of this fight. Boy,

27:44.600 --> 27:50.200
howdy. I have never seen anything like this happen. Are you scared for your life, Nick?

27:50.200 --> 27:54.200
I am absolutely terrified right now, brother. In the background,

27:54.200 --> 27:57.880
Planet Juggernaut just lets out like a T-Rex roar from Jurassic Park.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.960
Oh, wait, that's a that's what he does. Oh, okay, cool.

28:05.400 --> 28:13.960
That's the closest idea. Did you like that? Yeah, man. It was just like I was in

28:13.960 --> 28:18.520
Jurassic Park for the first time. Yeah. All right, Nick. No matter how scared we are,

28:18.520 --> 28:23.480
we have to continue to do. It's our job and we take it extremely seriously, don't we, Nick? Yes,

28:23.480 --> 28:29.720
we take it quite seriously to report this action the minute it happens. So let's go ahead and give

28:29.720 --> 28:36.040
a recap there. We had Clark Bishop, who seemingly for the first time in any scrap pit combat,

28:36.040 --> 28:41.320
has become friends with Planet Juggernaut. When he held him in his hand, the two seemed to talk

28:41.320 --> 28:45.800
to each other for some time. Now, I certainly read this that Clark seems to have fallen in

28:45.800 --> 28:51.800
love with the giant mechanical monstrosity, as we all have at one time or another. Ship them and I

28:51.800 --> 28:56.680
will watch it. The allure of metal spheres is great for the Nichols family. Am I right, brother?

28:56.680 --> 29:00.360
You could not be more wrong. Or the opposite of what I just said.

29:02.200 --> 29:08.760
Less wrong. I agree with you whole cloth. And Planet Juggernaut, I mean, what a performance.

29:08.760 --> 29:15.960
I have never seen a slave monster robot breaking shackles in such an entertaining and firework

29:15.960 --> 29:22.280
explode-y type way. It was really something. He did quite a big smash, I think is what we call it

29:22.280 --> 29:27.160
in the fighting community. That is right. He was the original who came up with that move. Who was

29:27.160 --> 29:39.000
that back in 1947? The original big smash came from? Mike Tyson. Hey guys, thanks for having me

29:39.000 --> 29:43.480
come in on the booth. I just wanted to give a quick shout out to Planet Juggernaut for using

29:43.480 --> 29:49.560
my cool move that I came up with in 1947. Thanks, Big Smash Mike Tyson. And it's a pleasure to be

29:49.560 --> 30:01.880
here. And we got... Keith Vigna, in a true show of his own colors, turns on the crowd and sprays

30:01.880 --> 30:08.040
some sort of terrible, terrible, obnoxious, freezing gas all over them. Freezing about,

30:08.040 --> 30:12.440
if my math is right, what do you think that was, like 37 to me? Yeah, you know, he froze

30:12.440 --> 30:19.240
37 people, but I'd say at least 15 of those were small children. Oh, goodness gracious. We all

30:19.240 --> 30:24.920
know that those lives are boring board. So that makes us sadder. It's like, welcome to family

30:24.920 --> 30:40.360
night. 12 and under getting free. Let's head down now to a little interview section where we talk

30:40.360 --> 30:46.440
to some of the crowd here at the scrap pit. We've got Jeremiah Johnson down in the crowd and ready

30:46.440 --> 30:53.480
to talk. Hey everybody, it's Jeremiah Johnson. I'm here with three individuals that it seems like

30:54.200 --> 31:03.400
are at least half to fully frozen in some sort of liquid that has covered them. This first person

31:03.400 --> 31:12.840
puts the mic up to your mouth. Yeah, that's really interesting. Thanks for coming to the

31:12.840 --> 31:21.000
scrap pit tonight and let's move on to the second person here and holds up the mic to you. So cold.

31:21.000 --> 31:27.160
Oh yeah, it is cold in here. I've asked them if they could make it warmer, but they say the body

31:27.160 --> 31:31.000
heat makes it so that we need to turn the thermostats way down and also we're underground,

31:31.000 --> 31:36.680
so it's always cold. And the third person who's here, their mouth seems to be a little bit more

31:36.680 --> 31:43.000
unstuck. Hey there Jeremiah. It looks like Keith there got me mostly from the waist down. I'm

31:43.000 --> 31:47.880
rooted in place here and I'm telling you what, I'm terrified. How does it feel to be frozen from the

31:47.880 --> 31:54.200
waist down, sir? It doesn't feel good. And real quick, what's your name? Charles Snort.

31:56.760 --> 32:02.040
I'm Charles Snort. I came here to take advantage of the family night. Is this your child next to

32:02.040 --> 32:05.240
you on the lot that we just interviewed? No, I don't know where my child is at this point.

32:06.680 --> 32:21.960
As he says that, we see in the background from the curtains over the box. What is that called?

32:21.960 --> 32:27.160
Box seats? Just the box? The box where the curtains are up, the Jimmy's curtains,

32:27.160 --> 32:34.600
are swaying and trembling and then all of a sudden an exorbitant amount of dirty water

32:34.600 --> 32:41.880
filled with different kinds of fish and a few humanoid figures explodes out of this theater box

32:41.880 --> 32:50.600
like a rushing waterfall cascading down multiple stories, the torrential downpour flowing steadily

32:50.600 --> 32:57.560
into the scrap pit. Can we see or recognize the bodies? Nope, not currently. It is just about

32:57.560 --> 33:06.120
four bodies that are all flying haphazardly, mostly covered in the water. And with that,

33:06.120 --> 33:12.360
we will head to the top of round seven. Clark Bishop, it is your turn. I'm essentially wanting

33:12.360 --> 33:16.040
to see, like I've seen this torrent of water coming out of up there, but I'm really wanting

33:16.040 --> 33:25.800
to see hopefully Marvin. I'm assuming that's where he would be. Sure. I pass a 32 on a 70.

33:25.800 --> 33:34.520
What you're gonna see is a few things. These four bodies, two of which are a short young woman and

33:34.520 --> 33:42.200
a tall old man, both wearing black suits, black ties, white shirts, ill-fitting windbreakers,

33:42.200 --> 33:47.400
and you see that FBI has written on the back of them. They decided to wear their FBI windbreakers

33:47.400 --> 33:53.640
into the scrap pit and they flew over the water. There's also the bald man wearing the black t-shirt

33:53.640 --> 33:59.320
and the jeans, who you would recognize as Billy Harrison, and the other two is Agent

33:59.320 --> 34:06.040
Kennedy and Agent McKinley. And the fourth body you see is tall and gaunt and wearing a black

34:06.040 --> 34:14.680
tuxedo and the skin stretched across these long bones and it is Marvin Glass. And the four bodies

34:14.680 --> 34:22.920
are all washed down so hard. The water pushes them so hard it pushes them into the scrap pit with you.

34:22.920 --> 34:30.520
Water is now filling up the coliseum and as that happens the dome begins to regrow. With that

34:30.520 --> 34:35.000
alertness roll, can I tell, are they conscious? All four bodies are conscious? They're just being

34:35.720 --> 34:40.520
swept away? That is correct. I mean I'd like to take a shot at Marvin with my turn if I see that

34:40.520 --> 34:44.840
happen. You do see that happen and you may take a shot at Marvin with your turn. I'm gonna do that

34:44.840 --> 34:53.000
with that sniper rifle. I already head out. Pass a 16 on an 80. Roll 2d10 for damage.

34:54.680 --> 35:00.120
Uh 14. Uh yeah 14. Nice. As soon as he lands you put three bullets in him.

35:03.880 --> 35:12.360
As he gets fucking pissed. He hates it. He hates getting shot. Oh man I fucking hate getting shot.

35:12.360 --> 35:18.920
He fucking hates getting shot. Planet juggernaut it's your turn. I watched these bodies fall and

35:18.920 --> 35:24.440
I turn around and I'm just bringing both fists down on Marvin. Roll fighting. I guess uh one

35:24.440 --> 35:34.600
and then the other. Fail the first one. God damn it two fails. You splash on both sides of him

35:34.600 --> 35:40.520
into the water and it I mean if anything it's intimidating. Before I've used all my actions

35:40.520 --> 35:47.480
I want to say. Clark jump on me and save yourself from the rising waters.

35:52.200 --> 35:58.440
Keith Vigna it's your turn. I see the water come in. I'm no longer concerned with the uh frozen

35:58.440 --> 36:07.720
people. They've calmed my nerves uh because they are not moving. I see that. Everybody's relaxed.

36:08.680 --> 36:15.240
I turn around. Everybody be cool. I turn around and I see Marvin Glass and I I see those shots

36:15.240 --> 36:21.400
go into him and then I see you know juggernaut pound and I can't see whether he misses or not

36:21.400 --> 36:29.560
but I let loose a stream of frozen nitro and just try to freeze Marvin Glass into place and

36:29.640 --> 36:32.360
the water around him. Go ahead and roll firearms.

36:35.480 --> 36:40.760
It's a fail. Actually you know what? You're gonna spend some luck. I'm gonna spend some luck. Yes.

36:40.760 --> 36:48.040
Nice. I'm gonna spend 19 points of luck to make that a success. Absolutely. What's that put your

36:48.040 --> 36:56.760
luck at? Uh 30 minus 19 is 11 if that's weird. Plus five so 16. All right. I didn't know what

36:56.760 --> 37:04.040
your luck was at. Good guess. Fucking clearly. I just let loose all the rest of the fuel I guess

37:04.040 --> 37:10.040
that I have in this. Just spraying on Marvin and all around him on the water and just try to

37:10.040 --> 37:18.600
completely icicle him. And that is what happens. Oh at the end of round seven. Oh my goodness.

37:18.600 --> 37:23.880
Nick Nichols. Nick Nick Nick Nichols. What do you think about all that? What a season it's been

37:23.960 --> 37:29.880
today. What a season. Oh my goodness. I have not seen such sportsmanship here in a long time. And

37:29.880 --> 37:35.240
you know what's interesting? A sort of people stew is starting to be made down there and believe me

37:35.240 --> 37:41.400
brother I'm ready to dive in and get me a mouthful. I love two things in this world. One is stew and

37:41.400 --> 37:49.160
the second is crawfish boils. And boy howdy is this the first one. All right. In that first

37:49.160 --> 37:56.120
round oh boy in round seven we had Clark Bishop who when we saw the water start pouring from the

37:56.120 --> 38:02.120
box where Marvin Glass typically resides with his whole retinue of Kevin and Rosemary and

38:02.120 --> 38:08.920
worm figures and Francis Beans we really did not expect that. What a boy howdy they just flew right

38:08.920 --> 38:12.840
on out of there with some people that I personally did not recognize. Did you recognize any of those

38:12.840 --> 38:19.080
people? I don't know most of those people. And so Clark Bishop he takes a shot right

38:19.640 --> 38:25.400
at Marvin Glass. All hail Marvin Glass. All hail Marvin Glass. And he fires true making him public

38:25.400 --> 38:31.640
into being number one here today. He is really taking a heel turn here in the scrap pit. And

38:31.640 --> 38:35.880
Planet Juggernaut he needed tips to help out punching down on either side of Marvin Glass

38:35.880 --> 38:39.400
spraying water up all earth planes. What do we think about that? You know it's crazy you

38:39.400 --> 38:45.720
mentioned a heel turn but really Planet Juggernaut is taking quite a turn also. Is it now its own

38:45.720 --> 38:52.520
robot beholden to no man? Is free will even real? You could say that again. Is free will even real?

38:52.520 --> 38:58.840
You could say that again. Is free will even real? Amazing and in the last Keith Vigna there he goes

38:58.840 --> 39:03.000
ahead and uses his weird gun that I personally have never seen used here in the scrap pit that

39:03.000 --> 39:09.880
makes the nitro freeze and it freezes all the way down and he makes a little icicle a little

39:09.880 --> 39:16.840
popsicle there. Marvin Glassicle if you will and he is fully surrounded in frozen water. I'd just

39:16.840 --> 39:30.680
like to say when Marvin screamed I definitely didn't not shit my pants. And before what I'm

39:30.680 --> 39:36.040
guessing is the final round of combat here at the scrap pit tonight we're gonna go ahead and

39:36.040 --> 39:41.800
send it over to a crowd favorite over at our jumbotron it is the dance of the silver ball.

39:41.800 --> 39:48.520
And you guys look up at the jumbotron and you see there are three skulls that pop up on the screen

39:49.320 --> 39:54.440
and one of the skulls cracks open and there's a small silver ball sitting underneath them and it

39:54.440 --> 40:00.760
goes into one of the skulls and then the skulls all do a little dance to the music and then

40:01.400 --> 40:06.680
halfway through one of the skulls opens up and the sphere comes out of it and goes into a different

40:06.680 --> 40:12.760
one and then it gets faster the second time around and then when it's done it's weird because

40:12.760 --> 40:18.040
everyone would be like really freaked out by what's happening but for the most part people

40:18.040 --> 40:28.200
love the dance of the silver spear so everyone's just like two two three two one two and it opens

40:28.280 --> 40:35.880
and it was one and people continue to flee they've all turned around at the exits

40:37.480 --> 40:43.400
all right wow what a crazy sphere dance all right let's get back to the action

40:43.400 --> 40:49.880
it was clark clark bishop it's your turn it's the top of round eight and at the top of round eight

40:49.880 --> 40:58.040
the floor begins to shake and vibrate as the dome fully rounds itself back out in a very fun

40:58.280 --> 41:04.280
magical fashion it pieces together a wholly new dome that is still made out of this crystal clear

41:04.280 --> 41:10.920
material however the ground begins rumbling violently it's your turn what do you want to do

41:10.920 --> 41:15.000
i'm going to make a mad dash for planet juggernaut and on my way i'm going to yell

41:15.640 --> 41:18.600
keith planet juggernaut's john and i keep going

41:21.080 --> 41:26.040
and i try and climb just like up onto planet juggernaut whatever the easiest way to do that is

41:26.040 --> 41:30.200
sure you uh what would be the easiest way to do that thomas uh there's any number of convenient

41:30.200 --> 41:36.280
like access ports and uh crevices in my hardware and you just like assassin's creed your way right

41:36.280 --> 41:40.600
up there nice and that's my whole action i'm just gonna ride out whatever's gonna happen next with

41:40.600 --> 41:52.440
my giant buddy awesome uh planet juggernaut it's your turn planet john or not have you had that

41:52.440 --> 42:08.840
locked and loaded for a week no two um so he's he's like hold on tight buddy he wants to rush

42:08.840 --> 42:13.640
up towards the ceiling like the dome before it closes in on itself and like try to get out the

42:13.640 --> 42:20.120
other side amazing you're gonna need to make a um what's it called a roll for that i don't know

42:20.120 --> 42:26.920
what you'll be rolling here um did you succeed doing a lot of yeah 50 50s so 38 38 that's a

42:26.920 --> 42:33.000

42:42.040 --> 42:52.920
real all right so all right it's real yeah what do you want to do man i want to send one extendo

42:52.920 --> 43:00.040
arm like flying out towards keith vigna um as the other one is like reaching up towards an opening

43:00.040 --> 43:05.640
at the top of the dome they're both like zipping out from the main body like kind of at equal

43:05.640 --> 43:12.280
speeds and one one is gonna try to just like pick up keith and take him with us as the other

43:12.280 --> 43:17.880
one launches us through like as i see him arm reach out to me i throw down my riot shield

43:18.440 --> 43:24.120
ride it towards him like a surfboard yeah send a saw right in the middle of the icicle that is

43:24.120 --> 43:31.560
marvin glass and throw my arms up in order for him to have a good grip on me there's a rule in

43:31.560 --> 43:39.000
tabletop role-playing games that many people call the rule of cool so that all happens yeah

43:43.720 --> 43:44.600
i love you

43:49.320 --> 43:59.480
can i roll some damage no okay cool what happens next is fucking bonkers but first let's recap

43:59.480 --> 44:06.680
what just happened clark bishop sprinted across to planet juggernaut while screaming out to keith

44:06.680 --> 44:16.280
that john is planet juggernaut clark then began climbing up this massive metal sphere keith threw

44:16.280 --> 44:23.800
down his riot shield like motherfucking electric shock and skim boarded toward planet juggernaut

44:23.800 --> 44:31.720
while he pulled out his soft winging crossbow and fired a circular saw blade into the brendan

44:31.720 --> 44:39.080
fraser style cube of icy trapped marvin glass in brendan fraser he was that one right yeah and

44:39.080 --> 44:48.440
oh uh leaning tower of cheezah guy is there and you see him in the crowd and he says something cool

44:49.000 --> 44:59.400
and then the ground the floor of the scrap pit begins to pulsate like it's breathing it expands

44:59.400 --> 45:06.040
to the point of breaking and up through these metal shards that once made up the stage of the

45:06.040 --> 45:17.560
scrap pit comes flowing and bubbling hot liquid magma the floor is lava and planet juggernaut

45:17.560 --> 45:23.400
after gogo gadgeting one mickey mouse hand to swoop up keith vigna and the other to fling

45:23.400 --> 45:28.840
yourself and your insane compatriots up out of the scrap pit as the dome completes its

45:28.840 --> 45:37.400
reincarnation you look down and see marvin glass frozen in some strange chemical compound

45:38.200 --> 45:48.280
disappear into the lava and you are standing on top of the dome of the scrap pit what do you want

45:48.280 --> 45:54.120
to do i i plopped the boys into a little pocket in my juggernaut shirt that i've been wearing this

45:54.120 --> 46:00.520
whole time a big t-shirt that says planet juggernaut and i rolled down the dome straight

46:00.520 --> 46:07.800
to where the announcers are nick nichols what do you think about this new thing that is currently

46:07.800 --> 46:13.320
happening we are seeing planet juggernaut with two friends rolling straight towards us now i hope

46:13.320 --> 46:18.680
it's for a warm embrace because we're as big as fans you do see his arms like outstretched

46:18.680 --> 46:23.800
towards you oh my god look at his arms they're all outstretched toward him let's give this big

46:23.800 --> 46:31.160
fella a hug nick and nick nichols both are holding up their arms in a hug-like manner

46:31.160 --> 46:37.720
and the last thing they see is two giant mickey mouse gloves swooping in to just embrace them

46:37.720 --> 46:49.640
oh with death

47:08.120 --> 47:15.640
so

47:18.120 --> 47:19.400
the screen goes dark

47:23.000 --> 47:26.360
and in this darkness we hear some music that justin made

47:29.320 --> 47:33.800
oh that's justin this is really good oh wow thanks guys it's good i like that i worked really hard

47:33.800 --> 47:38.120
on it that's a good melody on that cool sounds man oh what a sick drum solo right here

47:39.720 --> 47:43.080
i've been practicing did you get steven tyler do vocals on this no

47:44.520 --> 47:53.400
oh no you're right it's seal yes oh son is this song in five four that's right that's

47:53.400 --> 47:57.240
wow yeah you really went above and beyond on this one dude i definitely know how to do that

47:57.320 --> 48:02.680
the darkness one two three four five four one two three

48:05.320 --> 48:11.960
i like to think of it as a waltz with a two beat after each one two three one two one two three

48:11.960 --> 48:20.360
one two okay so we see a road i'm picturing the camera like on the ground in the middle of the

48:20.440 --> 48:29.320
two lanes trees line both sides and reach over blending together creating an autumnal canopy

48:30.200 --> 48:38.280
a rabbit recklessly races across the patchy pavement leaving behind a trail of blood thick

48:38.280 --> 48:45.720
enough to assume the animal's fate a car flies over the top of the camera driving furiously down

48:45.720 --> 48:52.840
the center of the road it's a boxy black sedan and it's trailed closely by a four-wheeler

48:53.800 --> 49:01.160
the two vehicles turn right on a gravel road and we pan over following them to see a wooden sign

49:02.200 --> 49:13.160
for the contention woods and text at the bottom of the screen reads 25 years earlier

49:15.720 --> 49:23.160
holy shit yeah fuck yeah

49:45.880 --> 49:57.160
she runs

49:57.400 --> 49:58.600
the sun

50:20.120 --> 50:26.600
to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon

50:27.880 --> 50:30.600
oh

50:37.880 --> 50:46.200
