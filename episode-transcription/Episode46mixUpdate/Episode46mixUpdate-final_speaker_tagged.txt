0.00 299.28 speaker0  Knock, knock. Who's there? It's me, Wolf. Wolf who? It's Wolf the dog. Well, I don't know you. Well, you're about to, baby. Open the damn door of your mind and let me in to feast upon your brain energy. Y'all know I'm here and devouring all wave-based energies in my path live from 694.2 PTBP.

But seriously, type about me on the internet. It gives a wolfie the strength he needs. Y'all, we had a little contest slash giveaway over on the subreddit supplying two D&D 5th edition starter sets and a bunch of dice to give away. The first drew the page in the leather bound book found at Jim Cook's house. It is only through death that he may rise again. The second winner will receive the other D&D 5th edition starter set, five sets of dice, and a box of D&D dungeon tiles. Luke claims he touched these tiles that fanfic that physically shipped Joe and Clark Bishop. Jesus, man. Seriously, y'all. the favorite entry, and they are proud to present a hardback slip case set of Delta absolutely stellar piece of art made my heart beat out of my chest. The attention to detail, especially the Polaroids in the background, blew me away and made the immense amount of up and taking us directly into the heart of the scrap pit is kudzu with no back bone.
294.28 439.64 speaker1  sure you don't hurt nobody. Get back, lose your mind. Shake it, break it. Overtime. Hey, DJ. Turn it up. UCD, you're gonna burn it up. Come on, come on, let's unfold. Say whoop. Mary Nightingale and the senior citizens. We appreciate your efforts and contributions the science. And we are back looking at the massive fight between Planet Juggernaut versus Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, and Friends, which is just now turned into at friends. What do we think, Big? This has been a whirlwind. Not as big as a bloodbath as I was expecting, but I am and boy, howdy. Has it been crazy? But you are right. Traditionally, most contestants do not make it past the second round here where they are stuck in the pit, in the scrap pit with about while still attached to this Planet Juggernaut has led you to rethink some things. All right. That's what I like to see. Go ahead and roll a d4 for me for almost dying. I'm at five. Boy, howdy. And in your state of rage, it's hard for me not to jump into,
434.36 464.12 speaker2  closest to me at this point. Theoretically, that is correct. So I'm going to try and wail on him
459.08 664.68 speaker1  so as you go to make this attack, I'm going to need you to roll a Constitution because inside this dome, we can call it like a biosphere now because wind begins to whip about and form a slight tornado in the corner and it is moving through toward you. It's picked up here in order to hold on to your sniper rifle as this high powered wind velocity is raging toward you. That's a pass. So you hold on strong and fire your firearm. the other side and hit the dome. And once again, you feel the dome, it like takes the energy and disperses it through the entire dome and the ground that you're standing on. So you all feel dexterity or athletics to fall gracefully instead of hurting yourself. Do we see anything in the That's five. And you fall right on your back and much like the upside down of a belly flop. Joe, you asked about the through and through of the bullets and looking through, you just see wires and mechanical bits in the very small holes that have been gauged through this massive orb,
652.60 670.92 speaker2  the curtains in Marvin glasses booth began rustling much like Jimmy's old school. I mean,
666.20 836.44 speaker1  you know that the brand of curtains are Jimmy's curtains and boy, howdy. Are they just wrestling individually. And because you have two actions, typically you don't take a negative on either of that means I miss Keith, but you grab a hold of Clark Bishop. What do you, uh, Clark Bishop is being held in the, what kind of, uh, like finger arm hands are we dealing with From within the depths of this saying, you just hear
828.68 878.36 speaker2  corner of your ear, this noise from the depths of the big ball. I don't know if at his distance, to Clark as them working together against me. So I set up, I set up my 50 cal mounted machine gun
871.00 975.16 speaker1  the tornado that is flying through the scrap pit currently is going to try to offset. The tornado is coming for you. You got to roll a constitution check to hold steady in this moment. you're so stuck into the ground that I will give you a plus 40% to your firearms check. But since you're firing at both of them, it would be a negative 40 to fire both of them. So it'll even
969.88 990.12 speaker2  gun with my other hand, but the force of it is so powerful. I definitely needed two hands to shoot this. And it just starts kind of spinning around and just hitting the walls and like kind
985.24 1081.96 speaker1  even though you critically succeeded on the strength to hold down, I'm going to say that while you fire and it's wagging about all over the place, you yourself lose control of your own suctions and get swept away in this tornado as your gun stays put on the ground, along with and everyone can see that burned on the bottom of your left foot is the name Maggie. As the tornado a hell of a round this time. The old tornado came out to play and Clark Bishop was able to hold on dear Lord tightly and he snipes away, landing a couple shots all the way through planet juggernaut,
1076.12 1106.44 speaker2  I've never seen planet juggernaut try to talk before. Did you hear him talking? I heard something
1100.20 1187.08 speaker1  moving on, we see Keith Vigna falls off from his safe place up on the top of the dome and he falls straight on his back, immediately slamming his gun into position. But he loses that right off the bat as the tornado sweeps him away and leaving his shoes stuck to the floor. You know, it's crazy tips from Alfred and Jermaine Glass. I believe we have a pre-recorded session for tonight. Oh, wait. Nope. I'm hearing that it's up for some reason. We're getting the live feed here. Oh, and we see the video screen on the, uh, the giant jumbotron is just a video shot of a dark room with a single light on it. And you see a young man in the shadows of the room who has just cradled himself into the fetal position and he's rocking back and forth.
1183.08 1204.60 speaker2  He didn't have a chance in the gun. The gun disappeared. I mean, one disappeared,
1201.00 1232.12 speaker1  from Alfred Glass. Those are bad. I don't think we got any fighting pro tips there,
1228.12 1347.16 speaker2  to him and claiming to be John. But this isn't the first time that he's had somebody who doesn't all the sanity, he is convinced. He didn't need much to believe that this is John talking to him
1342.92 1433.32 speaker1  depending on whether or not you roll lower or higher. We'll see what you're trying to roll. Wolf had this visor on his helmet that made it hard for you to track his movements. So I'm picturing like full blown like robot vision for you and your robot vision as you're talking to Clark Bishop, who's standing in the palm of your hand, blinks in the crowd and you see that there's specific movement and you actually you see a young, bald, fit man with sunken, intense eyes wearing a black T-shirt and jeans. And he is walking through the crowd and he is heading
1425.80 1500.36 speaker3  down on the ground and then I just reel both robot fists back and I want to smash the wall.
1490.60 1530.44 speaker1  Mouse pants into the dome, your hands, they like stick immediately. You feel like the adhesive from the dome, but they power through and the entire dome slowly creaks and the whole thing
1526.52 1566.84 speaker3  see this thing crack, but you hear the loudest woo.
1561.08 1578.84 speaker1  so my favorite fireworks are the ones that go boom. And then as it like comes up, you don't really see it. And then you hear just like boom. And then there's a giant round. It's
1574.20 1593.32 speaker3  all like the gold. Oh yeah. And it's like pop rocks. I know the boys you mean. Like weeping
1584.04 1602.84 speaker1  like as it pours down. And people start losing their fucking minds. But rounds are only six
1598.52 1647.16 speaker2  Keith's first thought after he had been sucked up into the tornado was that that was my only chance to get rid of my two enemies now. So now that I'm surrounded by bloodthirsty people, I'm aiming my nitro thrower just at everybody in the arena around me and just like
1640.28 1677.88 speaker1  37 people get frozen solid as they're like trying to make their honestly they're just really scared howdy. I have never seen anything like this happen. Are you scared for your life, Nick?
1674.20 1703.48 speaker3  Planet Juggernaut just lets out like a T-Rex roar from Jurassic Park.
1698.52 1731.80 speaker1  we have to continue to do. It's our job and we take it extremely seriously, don't we, Nick? Yes, we take it quite seriously to report this action the minute it happens. So let's go ahead and give a recap there. We had Clark Bishop, who seemingly for the first time in any scrap pit combat, has become friends with Planet Juggernaut. When he held him in his hand, the two seemed to talk
1725.80 1755.96 speaker2  love with the giant mechanical monstrosity, as we all have at one time or another. Ship them and I
1748.76 2005.80 speaker1  I have never seen a slave monster robot breaking shackles in such an entertaining and firework come in on the booth. I just wanted to give a quick shout out to Planet Juggernaut for using if my math is right, what do you think that was, like 37 to me? Yeah, you know, he froze to some of the crowd here at the scrap pit. We've got Jeremiah Johnson down in the crowd and ready to talk. Hey everybody, it's Jeremiah Johnson. I'm here with three individuals that it seems like heat makes it so that we need to turn the thermostats way down and also we're underground, rooted in place here and I'm telling you what, I'm terrified. How does it feel to be frozen from the Box seats? Just the box? The box where the curtains are up, the Jimmy's curtains, are swaying and trembling and then all of a sudden an exorbitant amount of dirty water filled with different kinds of fish and a few humanoid figures explodes out of this theater box like a rushing waterfall cascading down multiple stories, the torrential downpour flowing steadily four bodies that are all flying haphazardly, mostly covered in the water. And with that,
1996.04 2022.20 speaker2  to see hopefully Marvin. I'm assuming that's where he would be. Sure. I pass a 32 on a 70.
2014.52 2075.00 speaker1  a tall old man, both wearing black suits, black ties, white shirts, ill-fitting windbreakers, and you see that FBI has written on the back of them. They decided to wear their FBI windbreakers into the scrap pit and they flew over the water. There's also the bald man wearing the black t-shirt and the jeans, who you would recognize as Billy Harrison, and the other two is Agent tuxedo and the skin stretched across these long bones and it is Marvin Glass. And the four bodies are all washed down so hard. The water pushes them so hard it pushes them into the scrap pit with you.
2070.52 2124.44 speaker2  alertness roll, can I tell, are they conscious? All four bodies are conscious? They're just being
2118.92 2189.56 speaker3  I turn around and I'm just bringing both fists down on Marvin. Roll fighting. I guess uh one
2181.40 2276.12 speaker2  but I let loose a stream of frozen nitro and just try to freeze Marvin Glass into place and that I have in this. Just spraying on Marvin and all around him on the water and just try to
2269.16 2332.52 speaker1  round oh boy in round seven we had Clark Bishop who when we saw the water start pouring from the box where Marvin Glass typically resides with his whole retinue of Kevin and Rosemary and worm figures and Francis Beans we really did not expect that. What a boy howdy they just flew right on out of there with some people that I personally did not recognize. Did you recognize any of those into being number one here today. He is really taking a heel turn here in the scrap pit. And Planet Juggernaut he needed tips to help out punching down on either side of Marvin Glass
2325.72 2343.00 speaker2  robot beholden to no man? Is free will even real? You could say that again. Is free will even real?
2338.84 2388.52 speaker1  ahead and uses his weird gun that I personally have never seen used here in the scrap pit that makes the nitro freeze and it freezes all the way down and he makes a little icicle a little guessing is the final round of combat here at the scrap pit tonight we're gonna go ahead and send it over to a crowd favorite over at our jumbotron it is the dance of the silver ball.
2381.80 2394.44 speaker2  And you guys look up at the jumbotron and you see there are three skulls that pop up on the screen
2389.32 2486.04 speaker1  and one of the skulls cracks open and there's a small silver ball sitting underneath them and it goes into one of the skulls and then the skulls all do a little dance to the music and then halfway through one of the skulls opens up and the sphere comes out of it and goes into a different everyone would be like really freaked out by what's happening but for the most part people it was clark clark bishop it's your turn it's the top of round eight and at the top of round eight the floor begins to shake and vibrate as the dome fully rounds itself back out in a very fun magical fashion it pieces together a wholly new dome that is still made out of this crystal clear material however the ground begins rumbling violently it's your turn what do you want to do
2481.08 2496.28 speaker2  and i try and climb just like up onto planet juggernaut whatever the easiest way to do that is
2490.20 2619.00 speaker3  like access ports and uh crevices in my hardware and you just like assassin's creed your way right up towards the ceiling like the dome before it closes in on itself and like try to get out the arm like flying out towards keith vigna um as the other one is like reaching up towards an opening at the top of the dome they're both like zipping out from the main body like kind of at equal
2611.56 2760.52 speaker1  tabletop role-playing games that many people call the rule of cool so that all happens yeah what just happened clark bishop sprinted across to planet juggernaut while screaming out to keith that john is planet juggernaut clark then began climbing up this massive metal sphere keith threw down his riot shield like motherfucking electric shock and skim boarded toward planet juggernaut while he pulled out his soft winging crossbow and fired a circular saw blade into the brendan fraser style cube of icy trapped marvin glass in brendan fraser he was that one right yeah and and then the ground the floor of the scrap pit begins to pulsate like it's breathing it expands to the point of breaking and up through these metal shards that once made up the stage of the scrap pit comes flowing and bubbling hot liquid magma the floor is lava and planet juggernaut after gogo gadgeting one mickey mouse hand to swoop up keith vigna and the other to fling yourself and your insane compatriots up out of the scrap pit as the dome completes its reincarnation you look down and see marvin glass frozen in some strange chemical compound
2754.12 2791.16 speaker3  whole time a big t-shirt that says planet juggernaut and i rolled down the dome straight
2783.80 2835.64 speaker1  fella a hug nick and nick nichols both are holding up their arms in a hug-like manner
2828.12 2846.36 speaker2  so
2843.00 2863.08 speaker1  and in this darkness we hear some music that justin made
2859.72 2900.36 speaker2  i've been practicing did you get steven tyler do vocals on this no
2891.96 3070.68 speaker1  one two okay so we see a road i'm picturing the camera like on the ground in the middle of the two lanes trees line both sides and reach over blending together creating an autumnal canopy a rabbit recklessly races across the patchy pavement leaving behind a trail of blood thick enough to assume the animal's fate a car flies over the top of the camera driving furiously down the center of the road it's a boxy black sedan and it's trailed closely by a four-wheeler the two vehicles turn right on a gravel road and we pan over following them to see a wooden sign
3061.32 3071.96 speaker0  of episodes 24 through 46 and know that you are not alone much love yours both truly and falsely wolf the dog wolf the dog
