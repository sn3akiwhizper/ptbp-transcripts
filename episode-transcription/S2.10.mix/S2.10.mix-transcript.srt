1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Allow me to introduce myself for any new listener who happened upon our show during this new

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,760
series of stories, or any old listener who is confused about whom or what I am.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,340
I am Wolf the Dog.

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,120
I am the DJ.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:33,560
We broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP, the best radio station that ever was and shall be,

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,440
alongside my producer and my dog, Wolf the Dog.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,780
You are my listeners, my special wolf pack, my pepperonis.

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,720
You listen intently whenever I speak.

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,540
You give me your love, your energy, your spoiled goods.

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,800
You gaze into the void that is my maw.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
You feel comfort.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,320
I give you an endless amount of content, a recap of whatever happened whenever I am in

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,580
the last little while, a new song by a new artist every week, and I sometimes read the

14
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,180
things you write towards me in our segment called Howlin' with Wolf.

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:29,680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mads, at Medusa, but it's spelt all funny, who proudly

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,140
hails from Sacramento, California.

17
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,900
They tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a thing you can also do if

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
you have a Twitter account.

19
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
Mads writes,

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,860
Hi, Wolf.

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,500
This one goes out to the Neo Scum Discord and all the nasty little freaks in there whom

22
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,100
I love more than I can put into words.

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,820
Heck, I got matching tattoos with a bunch of you and I think that says it all.

24
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:07,060
I refuse to give Cameron the satisfaction of a shout out by another scummer for getting

25
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,940
so many of us to turn the dial to 694.2 PTBP.

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,300
You hear that, Cam?

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Wait, shit.

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,300
Wolf, cut that part.

29
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,780
I can bribe you with some primo trash juice.

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,500
Listen to Neo Scum.

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,460
Neo Scum good.

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,740
Anyway, here's Wonderwall.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:40,260
Hmm, Mads, Mads, Mads, Mads, trying to bribe me of all entities with trash juice?

34
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,900
You think it's so simple to sway the emotions of a being such as I with such simple pleasures

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
as primo trash juice?

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,100
Well, you'd think right.

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,500
Send that stanky dranky over here in at least a five gallon bucket.

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500
And don't you ever mention Wonderwall ever again.

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,380
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter

40
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,100

41
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,620

42
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,860

47

All that super sick swag can be swiftly swiped at pretending pod dot shop.

48
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,900
All can be found in the show notes.

49
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,660
It takes me hours to write the show notes, so please would you go look at them?

50
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,220
Now if you're just tuning in, welcome back.

51
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,460
It's time for the news.

52
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,580
Last time we caught up with the crew of the death of a salesman, Wavy Adler, Mr. Edward

53
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,920
Spitz, Alabasta, Al Chernobog, and Dr. Shark.

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,340
Now please imagine that meme where the girl explains things.

55
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,740
So Wavy Adler is the ship's navigator, its eyes, while Mr. Spitz brings a bit of class

56
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,420
to the pirate vessel, okay?

57
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,340
Al Chernobog has a monkey and dripping open lesions all over.

58
00:04:52,340 --> 00:05:00,020
Also Dr. Shark was the saw bones, even sawed a leg off the cabin boy, Jurgen Stick, and

59
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,780
got him fit for a peg leg.

60
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,140
That gave Jurgen half the peg legs Dr. Shark left sticking out of the quicksand that had

61
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:16,540
just consumed the dread pirate neck beard when he dove in head first to his single episode

62
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,280
appearance based demise.

63
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,500
Got all that?

64
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Good.

65
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,860
Join us now, back to the action on this island with a big ol' statue of a humanoid alligator

66
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,780
and multiple narrow ditches filled with blood that seem to run all along the beach.

67
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,860
It's R.I. Peter with Cruisin'!

68
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:35,100
Oh, his feet ache, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my

69
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
gosh.

70
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,520
Is that like a, of course you were thinking about how much fun you would have there so

71
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
you laughed.

72
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,760
All of our listeners are in Hillsong, that are in Australia.

73
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Really?

74
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Yeah.

75
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Is Hillsong the name of a town?

76
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,960
Yeah, on Patreon when it says location Australia Hillsong.

77
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Damn.

78
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,320
It's the name of the country now actually.

79
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
The whole country is Hillsong.

80
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,060
Yeah, ever since that documentary came out and, the sound of music?

81
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Yeah.

82
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,360
There were Nazis the whole time.

83
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,720
Those were Hillsongs, right?

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,140
Yes, they were.

85
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,420
The Hills have songs.

86
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
These hills have songs.

87
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,020
These hills are alive with the sound of music.

88
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,020
What did the guy say in Jason?

89
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
Friday the 13th?

90
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
It's a blood curse!

91
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,020
It's a blood curse!

92
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
It's a blood curse!

93
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
It's a blood curse!

94
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
It's a blood curse!

95
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Shut up Ralph, you son of a bitch.

96
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,420
You stupid fucking crazy bastard.

97
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Right off in the wrong way on a bike.

98
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,220
You ought to be lucky the mental asylum fucking closed down or you'd be getting beat every

99
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,780
day by Nurse Ratched.

100
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,100
What was the captain of the neck beards name?

101
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Captain Neckbeard.

102
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Captain Neckbeard.

103
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Was that it?

104
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Yes.

105
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Nice.

106
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,300
Yeah, remember we're going serious this time.

107
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,580
Captain Neckbeard's dead, the rest of it's serious.

108
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,860
The peg legs finally stop moving.

109
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:31,500
The bubbles rising above where the dread pirate neck beard had gone under have ceased to bubble.

110
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,900
And the crew from Neckbeard's ship ties their belts together.

111
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,540
Wait, all together?

112
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,380
Like to each other?

113
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
Like in a circle?

114
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
Yeah.

115
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
Yep, to each other.

116
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,340
This is gonna be tough crap boys.

117
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,940
And then they hold each other's shoulders and begin walking back toward the beach.

118
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,860
Are you Neckbeard's?

119
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
You wait right there.

120
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Okay.

121
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,740
Your captain just killed our doctor with his stupidity.

122
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,100
Yeah, I'm real sorry about that.

123
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,820
Wish YU is a doctor.

124
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:10,260
The three of them all look at each other and let's roll luck, 50-50 shot up and down.

125
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,780
Roll under, one of them's a doctor.

126
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
10.

127
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
10.

128
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,260
That's a success.

129
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Is that a 10 or a 100?

130
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
It's a 10.

131
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I can't see what the-

132
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
It's a 10.

133
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,260
No, 100 is all zeros.

134
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,260
All zeros, yeah.

135
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
It's a 10.

136
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
It's a 10!

137
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Yeah!

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,260
And I was actually gonna say-

139
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,860
He's a fucking medical chap.

140
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Yeah, I actually-

141
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,940
And the other two kind of move, try to shuffle behind him.

142
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,940
But again-

143
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Yeah, they're all tied together by the belts.

144
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,260
And so one of them's like, hey, it's schooling.

145
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,260
He's lots of schooling.

146
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,340
You should take him.

147
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
I do sir.

148
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,620
I have lots of schooling in medicine.

149
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,380
I have 100 minus whatever you rolled is what I was gonna say.

150
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,380
What's your name?

151
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,380
I'm very, very skilled.

152
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,380
What is your name?

153
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Jammin.

154
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
Jammin?

155
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Jammin?

156
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
Did you say, uh, Shammin?

157
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Did you say Jermaine?

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,420
Yeah.

159
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,660
How do you say it, sir?

160
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,540
You're asking us to tell you how to say your name?

161
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Yes.

162
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
I'm very scared right now.

163
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,540
I think it's Jimmy.

164
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,640
All right, Jimmy.

165
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
He nods.

166
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,940
You're coming with us.

167
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,940
And he nods and he slowly looks down at his rope belt, which is tied to the others.

168
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,700
You're all coming with us.

169
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,020
Which one of you is the sword guy?

170
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
I mean, I've got swords.

171
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Okay.

172
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,180
I'll swing to try and cut him free from the other two.

173
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
Oh, cool.

174
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,860
Which one of you would be more likely to do a cool, yeah.

175
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,940
I have like a knife that I can just cut the rope with.

176
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,220
Who would do it cool?

177
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
We're pirates.

178
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,380
Mine's, mine's got a octopus beak on it.

179
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,380
Can you beat that?

180
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
How about this?

181
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,380
How about this?

182
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,820
We're going to have to cut it twice to get him out.

183
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,820
You know?

184
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Oh, he's the one in the middle.

185
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
Okay.

186
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Yeah.

187
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
We'll throw at the same time.

188
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,100
We'll show off these sword tricks.

189
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,380
And if you don't do a good job, well then the doctor gets to show us how good his skills

190
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,220
are, don't we?

191
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Don't pass mine.

192
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
Oh, I pass mine.

193
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,500
28 on a 70.

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,460
Wavy pulls out his sword and he forgets to get the scabbard out, get it out of the scabbard,

195
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,900
so he just hits the rope with the scabbard.

196
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,540
That's embarrassing.

197
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,500
He just reaches down and cuts the other side and looks at alabaster owl and is like, oh,

198
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,460
it made me very nervous, sir.

199
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Alabaster stares at him for a second with like a questioning look and then he, he looks

200
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
over at Mr. Spitz.

201
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Why, uh, why are we taking him again?

202
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,620
He's a fucking sawbones, ain't he?

203
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,220
Oh, is this not a deadly pirate competition fraught with danger?

204
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,180
I forgot we lost our doctor.

205
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,420
The rest of you, uh, go wade into the quicksand.

206
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,500
The other two give you like massive eyes.

207
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,780
Wait, there's only two other crew members?

208
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Yeah.

209
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Okay.

210
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
I, yeah.

211
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,700
Then I like, I'm not intimidated at all.

212
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,980
I'm like expecting them to just wade into the quicksand.

213
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
No.

214
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Oh God.

215
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
No.

216
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,160
If we could actually just go back to the ship, that'd be great.

217
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,500
Just knee deep and you were here.

218
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Yeah.

219
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
Maybe some more neck pads will come along.

220
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,180
Maybe the jungle will take you.

221
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,100
I don't think that we're gonna go anywhere without our captain.

222
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
We're also supposed to, your captain's dead.

223
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Yes.

224
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
So we're gonna leave, I guess.

225
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Uh, no, but you'll get back on the ship and try to fight us later cause the whole thing's

226
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,460
a fight or something.

227
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,580
So you need to get in the quicksand.

228
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,140
You don't have to go all the way neck deep or, you know, head deep as your captain did,

229
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,500
but you need to stay there.

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,620
So fucking walk into the quicksand now.

231
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Eye roll, persuade.

232
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,140
Sometimes it sounds like you're speaking with another man's words, but it really found

233
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,140
like you found your voice there.

234
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
Yeah, mine are bad on all this.

235
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Mine are bad.

236
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
I got 15% intimidate.

237
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
Oh my God.

238
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
I rolled 100.

239
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:05,260
Okay, they're both going to push past you physically.

240
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,540
Like they're both going to shoulder check you as they walk past.

241
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,580
And then basically as soon as they get past, they are going to run as fast as they can.

242
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
What do you do?

243
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,860
I throw one of my iron grenades at them.

244
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Jesus Christ.

245
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,020
How many of those do you have?

246
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:26,180
I literally, I like make them in the base or in the basement of the ship, which is called

247
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,180
the?

248
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,180
Anybody?

249
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
The belly.

250
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
The death of a salesman.

251
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,180
Yeah, I don't know what it is either.

252
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,180
The belly of the death of a salesman.

253
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,700
Not the ship's name, but what is the basement of the ship called?

254
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
The under deck.

255
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
There's a number of different things.

256
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
The inside.

257
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Below deck.

258
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,700
I make it below deck.

259
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Yeah, basically you make it inside the ship.

260
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,220
Can I roll heavy weapons on that?

261
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
Yeah.

262
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Tight.

263
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Yeah, that's six.

264
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Okay.

265
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,220
Yeah.

266
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,220
As these two run off.

267
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
Can I tell you what happens with a grenade?

268
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Please tell me what happens with a grenade.

269
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,660
They bump into me and like shoulder check me and without even looking, I just kind of

270
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,460
like throw it behind me and it doinks one of them in the, in the head and then it lands

271
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,220
in front of them and they look down for a second.

272
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:12,660
They look at each other and then you see these two bodies just kind of a red mist, it dissipates

273
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,140
onto the leaves and all the foliage around as, as limbs just kind of fly around and the

274
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,020
rest of you kind of turn around and you see that Mitch has taken his rope, everybody's

275
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:30,580
got a rope and has been pulling out the body of Dr. Shark this whole time.

276
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,020
He kind of got it around one of the peg legs and is pulled enough to where the whole body

277
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,260
is coming out now and you see that Dr. Shark's head and specifically the ears are just completely

278
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,320
caked with this quicksand and it is just packed in around the head.

279
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,460
And then there were four or five, I don't, I'm not really clear on how many are competing

280
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
in this.

281
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,700
Well, we lost one doctor, but then we gained another and Jimmy so.

282
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,540
But I mean the neckbeards are, the team is gone, right?

283
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,340
Do we represent an advanced body of our crew or are they more aboard?

284
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,380
It's like the captains of a football team coming out for the coin toss.

285
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,900
We've crippled their leadership.

286
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,860
Yeah, actually guys, this works out really well for you, no spoilers.

287
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,820
He walks deeper into the forest jungle of this island and as he does, he turns around

288
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,300
one of these trees that's in the distance and seems to be grabbing at something.

289
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:32,700
And then as you approach, you see that he's putting on a cloak, like a black hooded cloak

290
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:41,260
and it goes over his entire body and covers his head or over his eyes, Jedi style, but

291
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:48,420
it is both short, it's short sleeved and it's, uh, it only comes up to about his thighs.

292
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,140
You started motioning with your hands.

293
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,460
No, I really thought you were going to like describe it as a crop top.

294
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, that's my bad.

295
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,820
It's absolutely a crop top.

296
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,940
He actually removes his shirt before he puts on this crop top robe.

297
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,260
He can be wearing it.

298
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,380
They're going to be so angry if they found out that I wasn't wearing this before.

299
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,940
So if you could just not say anything, that'd be awesome.

300
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,300
And now you look good.

301
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,460
What would you even call a garment like that?

302
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, it's a, it's a crude, it's, it's a crude, like the movie, the crew.

303
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Yeah, it's a crudy.

304
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
I love that movie.

305
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,440
I saw it with my daughter that I don't have, cause it's my dream to have one.

306
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,540
I thought about this movie that could be made.

307
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
I like the backstory.

308
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,820
How you became a Beatle.

309
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,420
When I get, it's my dream.

310
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,900
When I talk about my dreams, I think about me, favorite band, the world that could be

311
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,180
my whole band and the favorite, my whole favorite band in the world.

312
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
They sing.

313
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:55,460
When I start to imagine, what should we do with the Eleanor Rigby, throw a silver lining.

314
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,900
We shave a belly with a rusty razor.

315
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,660
I raised the sails today, oh boy.

316
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
And you guys walk further and further in.

317
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,700
And as you're walking, you can see that, that pillar of smoke in the distance that you're

318
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:19,400
walking toward, but you, you approach a clearing far before this, this pillar of smoke that's

319
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
in the distance.

320
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,340
And in this clearing, we've established that we have tied Jimmy up and are leading them

321
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,660
by his belt and the slashed belts of his comrades.

322
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
You have now.

323
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Yes, absolutely.

324
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,780
And how are you transporting the body of Dr. Shark?

325
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,180
I thought Mitch was on that.

326
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Yeah.

327
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,580
He's just been dragging the body.

328
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,820
I didn't understand why he wanted it, but I, he said it would be advantageous.

329
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,500
He just kind of kept the rope tied around it and just continues to drag it and he's

330
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,900
just like, okay guys, Hey, I just want to say, um, before we get in there, you guys

331
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
seem really cool.

332
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,940
So I'm really rooting for you and I hope you win.

333
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Well, thank you, Mitch.

334
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
That means a lot.

335
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:07,740
Well, you're not going to, sorry, happy birthday, happy birthday, I didn't know it was your

336
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
birthday, Mitch.

337
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,900
Happy birthday.

338
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:17,380
It's one of the Beatles birthdays, dude, just be a beetle, a beetle.

339
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,100
You were doing the Australian, totally nailing it.

340
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:28,220
You were in the, in the flow state, listen to his happy birthday, happy, happy birthday.

341
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,780
I got to think about a guy that's really excited to talk about things and you're all back in

342
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
it.

343
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,780
I just got to be really excited about anything.

344
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,100
Jimmy, are you not going to be our doctor?

345
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,540
He's not excited about Jimmy not being a doctor.

346
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
He's sad about it.

347
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,900
Jimmy, are you going to be our doctor?

348
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:59,740
My character asks Jimmy if he's going to be the doctor, uh, with his blade brandished.

349
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,780
Jimmy smiles a wry smile that says that he's not intimidated by you at all.

350
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
It can't be trusted.

351
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,780
Wait, wait, wait.

352
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,420
The intimidation rule failed, but then he obliterated those two dudes.

353
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
You're absolutely right.

354
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
You're absolutely right.

355
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
We're still covered.

356
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,380
Our backs are red with their blood.

357
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,420
I'm so sorry.

358
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:27,300
His lips tremble as he's like, whatever doctor you need to be, sir, anything that, you know,

359
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,940
what's blood do?

360
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,940
Yeah.

361
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
What's blood?

362
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
You tell us.

363
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
I've always wondered that myself.

364
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
What does blood do, doc?

365
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
It flows.

366
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
Why does it flow?

367
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,860
Don't get clever with us.

368
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,940
The brain makes it pump through the entire body.

369
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,740
It's from your brain.

370
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,420
That's where we think all of our thoughts and it's where all of our emotions come from.

371
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,380
All right, then come from my belly.

372
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
I believe him.

373
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,980
He'll be a good doctor.

374
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,780
Then I cut his vocal cords so he can't talk to us anymore.

375
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Are you intimidated now?

376
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:07,980
I thought you were going to kill him so you didn't have to play this character.

377
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,020
No, you should have a doctor.

378
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Oh, I thought you were, I thought you were going to be like, so I got to leave smiling

379
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,020
because you failed.

380
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
You're an intimidation checker here.

381
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Oh, okay.

382
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm an idiot then.

383
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,020
I don't know.

384
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,020
Thomas was right though.

385
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
He's totally intimidated now.

386
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Yeah.

387
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
Yeah, especially with his vocal cords cut.

388
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
Yeah.

389
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:32,860
And I realized, Alabaster realizes, wow, I can't believe I did surgery on his vocal cords.

390
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
Maybe I'm a doctor.

391
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
Let's not.

392
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,580
I mean, do we want to do that or not?

393
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
I don't want to.

394
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
That's too ridiculous.

395
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
Okay.

396
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
Yeah.

397
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
Yeah.

398
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,180
Okay guys, let's um, let's go into the tower.

399
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,900
Wait, is that Mitch or Jimmy?

400
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
I'm Mitch.

401
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,140
Jimmy talks like this sir, with his lips quivering and he always says sir at the end, sir.

402
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,940
I'm Mitch and uh, we're going to the tower now, are you ready?

403
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,020
Is the tower where the smoke's coming from or was that the thing we saw back at the beach?

404
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,260
No, the tower is actually neither of those things.

405
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Oh my.

406
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Come with me.

407
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,540
Should we be wearing a crude like you?

408
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:16,660
And he opens up like a, uh, Oh, like a bead curtain, but it's a leaves and vines and stuff.

409
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,860
And he opens it up into this clearing and you see, uh, you see another ditch immediately

410
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,620
as soon as you're on the other side of the clearing.

411
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,180
And this ditch is not filled with blood.

412
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,760
It's filled with a clear liquid that one might assume is water.

413
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,280
And that's not the only different thing about this ditch.

414
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,840
This one, you can actually see where it continues on either side and it goes in a large circle,

415
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,880
which is the circle of this clearing that exists here in the middle of this island in

416
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
the jungle.

417
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,600
So is it like right next to the edge of the trees and stuff?

418
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes.

419
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
It's a moat on the edge of the trees.

420
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Yeah.

421
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,640
And just inside of that moat, uh, you see another moat and another and another, and

422
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,880
they get smaller and smaller as they would as they go inside.

423
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,920
And some are filled with water.

424
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,040
Some are filled with blood.

425
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:22,520
And Mitch, uh, turns you guys in, he's like, Oh yes, be mindful of the waterways and be

426
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:33,280
mindful of, uh, the gutters and the trenches, all of these canals.

427
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:40,640
And he looks out and in the middle of all of these pools, you see, there are a few other

428
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,280
crudy wearing folks.

429
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,760
There are three mean pirate camp counselors, mean pirate.

430
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
I haven't seen this movie.

431
00:22:50,760 --> 00:23:00,120
It's going to be hard to, wait, what movie pirate camp doesn't exist, but we'll make

432
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
it.

433
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Pirate camp.

434
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,760
You best stop leaving in pirate summer camps, you're in one.

435
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
All right.

436
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Blue team to ultimate frisbee.

437
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,560
One of them says from their crudy, no, I was so glad you said no, no, no, no.

438
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,080
Mitch, Mitch gets really serious and is like, come this way.

439
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,760
Wavy picks up what, what he's laying down and of course, master Mitch, I mean, master

440
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,360
mysterious man, we will follow the lead.

441
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,760
I've never had this guy's name ever in my life.

442
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:42,680
The three crudy wearing folks turn and you see the tallest one has this like huge, massive

443
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
jaw.

444
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,040
And from underneath his hood, when, when you say that about Mitch, he gets a big smile

445
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,880
on his face and the other two are still hidden by their crudy hoods.

446
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,760
Are we talking like a strong jaw or like, like a radium lipstick?

447
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,640
Like looks like you, you're not human kind of job.

448
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
Oh, sorry.

449
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Human jaw.

450
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
My bad.

451
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
We're playing pulp Cthulhu.

452
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
It's a human.

453
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
I know it's human.

454
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
It's not like, like you'd look at them and be like your jaws five times the size of somebody

455
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,080
else's jaw, a monstrous job, alligator men.

456
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,600
Hey, that's a real good point.

457
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,720
So just like a chiseled jaw.

458
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
It's like a chiseled jaw.

459
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Nice.

460
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
So there's a real Chad in a, uh, a chode.

461
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
What are we chud?

462
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
We've got a Chad in a chud.

463
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,720
It's real Chad in a chode.

464
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Mitch is leading the three of you as well as the body of Dr. Shark and Jimmy.

465
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
The five of us.

466
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
We're going to a weekend at Bernie's, Dr. Shark.

467
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:55,720
And as you guys walk toward the center, you do see that there are five pools placed around

468
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
the circle.

469
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,720
The largest of these moats connects all five of these pools of water.

470
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:11,720
And you would see that currently three of these pools are unvacant.

471
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
Full.

472
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Not empty.

473
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Taken.

474
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,720
They're lacking the emptiness.

475
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Occupied, full.

476
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Three of these pools are wet.

477
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
Yes.

478
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Like filled with water.

479
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Filled with people.

480
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Uh, there are human bodies in three of them and the other two are empty.

481
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,720
They are laying flat on their backs with their ears in the water, but their eyes and nose

482
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
and mouth above water.

483
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Oh.

484
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,720
From the distance here, can I see if any of them are alive or are they all dead on their

485
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
backs?

486
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Go ahead and roll a medical check for intelligence.

487
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
You're going intelligence?

488
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
It's an eight on a intelligence of 70.

489
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Yeah, that'll do it.

490
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
These three people are breathing.

491
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
All three of them.

492
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Oh, it's only three.

493
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I thought each pool had a number of bodies in there.

494
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
Yeah.

495
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I was imagining like bodies stacked on top of each other.

496
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Oh, my bad.

497
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Sorry.

498
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
One person per pool.

499
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
One person per pool.

500
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Not pools full of bodies.

501
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Nope.

502
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,720
These pools are only big enough for one body to lay flat, almost like a pod.

503
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Gotcha.

504
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,720
So full of bodies means that there are three holes filled with three bodies.

505
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
There are three pods.

506
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Three pods full, two pods empty.

507
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Okay.

508
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
They can't.

509
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Do these people in the pods look like pirates to us?

510
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Yeah.

511
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,720
Edward Spitz does not cross himself for three bodies.

512
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
He spits.

513
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
Well, they all certainly seem relaxed.

514
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Well, yeah, because he hasn't communicated that he knows that they're breathing, I take

515
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,720
a little bit of gunpowder out of my pocket and flick it on one of their faces to see

516
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
if it moves with their breath.

517
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,720
As you walk over there, the tall man in the middle says,

518
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Hey, Cielo, could you please not?

519
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,720
If you could come this way, we must begin.

520
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
He might much look bad.

521
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
I keep the gunpowder in my pocket.

522
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
And then I do what he asked me to do.

523
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,720
We have spaced out this process between the crews in order to keep the violence offshore.

524
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Each crew will be given an orator.

525
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Each orator?

526
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,720
And as he says orator, he motions at each side of him.

527
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Each orator will be positioned at the stern of each ship with only their barrel and their

528
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
words.

529
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,720
And he points and you see two barrels kind of at the edge of the jungle.

530
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Like a wine barrel?

531
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Yep, a full big wine barrel.

532
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Each orator will be positioned at the stern of each ship with only their barrel and their

533
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
words.

534
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,720
In order to win the competition, your orator must not be interrupted.

535
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,720
A steady stream must come from both their mouth and their bong hole.

536
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:18,720
The first crew to sail in a complete circle around the island will win a job that will

537
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,720
earn so much wealth it would embarrass the queen.

538
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:33,720
But each crew must leave a deposit here to ensure the safe return of our orators.

539
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,720
And we just found out how you were originally going to have Beth May leave the podcast.

540
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:47,720
It's a really good thing we kidnapped a bloke.

541
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Mitch, kind of out of the corner of his mouth is like, maybe keep your doctor and use the

542
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,720
body.

543
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
It's smart, we really could burn, is it?

544
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Yeah.

545
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,720
I pull a pair of pretty rad sunglasses out from my coat pocket and slip it on Dr. Shark.

546
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
What are your sunglasses?

547
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,720
They are how you disguise a body that is dead and make it look like it's alive and having

548
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
a fun time all weekend.

549
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Two eye patches?

550
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Well, it's something that Alabaster was asked to make.

551
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
What year did you say this was?

552
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I think there are sunglasses.

553
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,720
I think Keith Richards wears them in the pirate movie.

554
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,720
No, Dr. Spitz asked me, Mr. Spitz asked me to make something to block the sun and I made

555
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:43,720
out of broken brown bottles, I crafted you some Oakley looking futuristic glasses.

556
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:51,720
So I put those on me and then out of Dr. Shark's 1920s coat jacket, I pull a pair of sunglasses

557
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,720
and put them on Dr. Shark.

558
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
It works.

559
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Look at this contraption I found, it'll block the eyes, you can't see the maggots coming

560
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
out of them.

561
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
This will be your orator.

562
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,720
He motions to one of the two crudy wearing folk and she begins to walk.

563
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Shotgun Mitch, we shawty Mitch.

564
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
We'd like to have Mitch as our...

565
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
We want Mitch.

566
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Mitch, Mitch, he's our man.

567
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Mr. Mystery Men.

568
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
If they can't do it, no one can.

569
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I'm excited so, no, I'm not excited so I'm talking like this.

570
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Mitch and the woman who moved forward to be your orator both turn and look at the tall

571
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
man and the crudy.

572
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Mitch, do you know the words?

573
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Mitch, do you know the words?

574
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Sir, I do.

575
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
I put a gun to Mitch's back.

576
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I whisper in his ear, do you know the words, boy?

577
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Very cool.

578
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,720
He turns back and he's talking to you while the large man is talking.

579
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Mitch whispers like, yes, very quickly.

580
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,720
And the large man says, well, then if you would like to go with him, you may.

581
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
We'd love to have you.

582
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Oh, that's like the words that Mitch has been wanting to hear his entire life.

583
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,720
He turns in like his hood bounces kind of off of his head a little bit as he turns and

584
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,720
flashes you just a massive smile full of warmth and joy.

585
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,720
And he turns back and he says, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

586
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Sure, sure.

587
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
I can do it.

588
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
I'm proud of you, son.

589
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:42,720
While this is happening, I like discreetly in one of his hands give him one of my grenades

590
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
for later.

591
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,720
To kill yourself if you can't do it and the shame is too much.

592
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,720
No, for protection later maybe or to help us.

593
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
From the shame.

594
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Can Waverly clock the other person?

595
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,720
So we've got big man, woman, clock the other person and see if I see a familiar relation

596
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
between all of them.

597
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Cool.

598
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Is that spot hidden?

599
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Yeah.

600
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,720
It's a 38 and I got that special thing.

601
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
So let's see if I roll better.

602
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Nope.

603
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
Did you pass?

604
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Did you pass?

605
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Yeah, pass.

606
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Sorry, pass on the first one.

607
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Rad.

608
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Yeah.

609
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
So this is the Diggory family.

610
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
You recognize the Diggory family.

611
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Cedric Diggory?

612
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Holy shit.

613
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
They're wearing robes too.

614
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
I didn't even think of that.

615
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Are we going to fight a dragon?

616
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,720
No, but Voldemort's going to kill you.

617
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,720
The Diggory family is extremely well known.

618
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Oh shit.

619
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,720
Very, very wealthy and have been missing for some time.

620
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Do we know of a Mitch Diggory?

621
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Oh, the Diggory family.

622
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Doc.

623
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
The person.

624
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
The Diggory family, Robinson.

625
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,720
The Diggory family doc is where we're parked.

626
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Yeah, that is where we're parked.

627
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Incredible.

628
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,720
I love the idea of a very wealthy family all out here in their shitty fucking crop top

629
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
hoodies.

630
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Yep.

631
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Like putting on pirate games.

632
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Am I imagining this wrong?

633
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
They've got a hood, right?

634
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Yep.

635
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
But their face is a little bit shown.

636
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Yeah, their eyes are being covered for the most part.

637
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Got it.

638
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Except for-

639
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
This is hilarious.

640
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,720
As far as age goes, it's mother, father, and then brother and or sister.

641
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
We haven't clocked to the third one.

642
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Yeah, the other one is a sister.

643
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Okay.

644
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,720
So mother, father, son.

645
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,720
I know you said they were black hoodies or a black hood, but I'm just picturing Heather

646
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Grey.

647
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I don't know who Heather Grey is.

648
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
The color?

649
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
The color.

650
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
I'm kidding.

651
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
I was confused.

652
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I thought that was Grey's Anatomy name or something.

653
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,720
That's Dr. Grey.

654
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Yeah, but her sister is maybe Helen.

655
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
There is a tension hanging in the air right now.

656
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Are we the last to arrive?

657
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
No, actually.

658
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,720
And he clocks that your doctor is from a seemingly different crew based on spatial hair.

659
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Because he's got a neck beard.

660
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Mitch says, Captain neck beard drowned on the way in due to some quicksand.

661
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
I'd call it more like choking.

662
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Or like a suffocation, maybe?

663
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Yeah, like he got the earth itself inside his lungs, and then it grabbed him and wouldn't

664
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
let go.

665
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,720
Then yes, you are the last.

666
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:32,720
And he looks at the wife and the daughter with a certain amount of worry and extreme

667
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
joy.

668
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Alabaster raises his hand.

669
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Oh, yes.

670
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I love a well mannered sea pirate.

671
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Would you say you're the authority around these parts?

672
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Yes, of course.

673
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Okay, then can we have Captain Neckbeard's ship just tag along with us and help us out?

674
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,720
I tell you what, if you win today, you can have everyone else's ships.

675
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Well, I was thinking more for the competition.

676
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah.

677
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,720
I don't want to take credit for what your island has done, but we killed them basically.

678
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,720
And so we are already winning the game, I think, as far as I see it.

679
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,720
Yeah, we had the opportunity to help and we did nothing.

680
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:21,720
In fact, we let him drown and our doctor, nevermind, we let him drown.

681
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Don't worry about our guys.

682
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Yeah, we thought we should have two doctors and that would be smart.

683
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,720
That's why we got a fellow with the funny looking glasses.

684
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
He's like on your shoulder now.

685
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,720
He's between me and Mitch, I imagine.

686
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
And Edward says that.

687
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Also, that's not a neckbeard.

688
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
He just can't grow over it.

689
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
He's not part of the crew.

690
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
He just can't.

691
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Also, Captain Neckbeard said we could have his ship and use it for the competition as

692
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,720
he was suffocating or choking or drowning, whatever.

693
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,720
You're making quite the seafarers case, Cindy.

694
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I honestly couldn't care less as long as the stream from the bungalow is never cut.

695
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,720
All right, well, if we got two ships, could we get your wife as a second orator in a second

696
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
bungalow?

697
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Yes, of course.

698
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,720
And the woman walks toward you as well, solemnly, almost hesitantly.

699
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,720
As soon as somebody like of that social stature is anywhere near Mr. Spitz, he like very comically

700
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
bows and his shitty wig falls off.

701
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,720
She looks at you and she says, it's time to deposit your collateral.

702
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,720
She points at one of the pools on the outside of this clearing.

703
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Yeah, Lady Diggery, as you can see, our talker is sleeping one off here.

704
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
So me and your boy Mitch are going to help him over to his hole.

705
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Any problem, you won't hear a peep out of him this whole time, I'd imagine.

706
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Yep, she rolled a 90.

707
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
She doesn't even listen to people like of our...

708
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Oh God, not at all.

709
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,720
She's already turned around and is looking deeply into her husband's eyes and saying goodbye.

710
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,720
I hit play on the boombox that makes the doctor dance his way over to the pool.

711
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Mr. Spitz and Mitch Diggery walk over with the body of Dr. Shark and place him gently

712
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,720
into this pool and his ears are in the water, his eyes, nose and mouth are above

713
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:35,720
and this quicksand that was all gummed up the works of his head begins kind of mixing with the water.

714
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Yes sir, do you believe it is time to begin?

715
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,720
The other ships are waiting, you will see the smoke will change color

716
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
and that is how you will know to begin the race.

717
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Remember, a perfect circle, not perfect in shape so much as complete.

718
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,720
One end must come to the other, do you understand?

719
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,720
We could send the ships two different ways, we get there twice as fast.

720
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,720
I don't know if we can trust them, they've not got a captain.

721
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,720
It is a matter of who we put on that other ship to make sure that they follow our instructions.

722
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
That's true.

723
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,720
It does also have to be a clean circle from one bunghole, each bunghole.

724
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,720
I think maybe we use their ship as a defense, like a shield from the others.

725
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,720
But also with the second bunghole and the other one, we've got insurance in case our bunghole,

726
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,720
anything happens to it, go for it Mitch.

727
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,720
I think if anything gets fired at us though, we have that protecting us because those men

728
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,720
to me didn't know about them yesterday, won't know about them tomorrow.

729
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
If they die, they die.

730
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Oh, you mean the neckbeards?

731
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Yes, absolutely.

732
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Not our crew.

733
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
I agree.

734
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Not our crew that I could name every single one of them if you asked me to.

735
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Every, all, all of them.

736
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
I know there's a certain number but...

737
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
As any of us could, name all ninety souls aboard.

738
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
I'm not great at counting.

739
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
Well it was ninety.

740
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,720
And listen, I don't care about the neckbeards none either, all of them smell like cum.

741
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,720
I heard that mate.

742
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
No offense Dr. Jimmy.

743
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
No, none taken sir.

744
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,720
And he looks down at his well encrusted...

745
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,720
They pleasure themselves most terribly.

746
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,720
It's awful, it's awful what they do as he covers himself.

747
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,720
No strumpets will come aboard.

748
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,720
So should we head back to the ships and depart?

749
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I'd say so my Australian friend.

750
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,720
On the way back, Alabaster, he feels pretty uncomfortable with like, just having left

751
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,720
the dead body of his like, Dr. Shark is taking care of him like, kept him alive and so he

752
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,720
just watched that whole thing go down and was like, uncomfortable but he sings this

753
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,720
little lullaby that Dr. Shark used to sing to him.

754
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Hmm...

755
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Hmm...

756
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Dr. Shark did-did-did Dr. Shark did-did-did

757
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Dr. Shark did-did-did-did

758
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Dr. Sh-

759
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Early in the mornin'

760
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Sittin' in his belly with a rusty razor

761
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

762
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,720
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

763
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Early in the mornin'

764
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Hey, and up she rises

765
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Hey, and up she rises

766
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Hey, and up she rises

767
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Early in the mornin'

768
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Oh, that's the end of it

769
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
That's how we do it with the junkins

770
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Early in the mornin'

771
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
This is like a five, uh

772
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Five paragraph essay, like

773
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Tell them what you're gonna tell them

774
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them

775
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them

776
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
That's what we do with the drunken sailor
