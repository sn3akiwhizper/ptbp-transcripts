00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
Allow me to introduce myself for any new listener who happened upon our show during this new

00:07.920 --> 00:17.760
series of stories, or any old listener who is confused about whom or what I am.

00:17.760 --> 00:20.340
I am Wolf the Dog.

00:20.340 --> 00:23.120
I am the DJ.

00:23.120 --> 00:33.560
We broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP, the best radio station that ever was and shall be,

00:33.560 --> 00:39.440
alongside my producer and my dog, Wolf the Dog.

00:39.440 --> 00:46.780
You are my listeners, my special wolf pack, my pepperonis.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.720
You listen intently whenever I speak.

00:49.720 --> 00:55.540
You give me your love, your energy, your spoiled goods.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.800
You gaze into the void that is my maw.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.800
You feel comfort.

01:00.800 --> 01:09.320
I give you an endless amount of content, a recap of whatever happened whenever I am in

01:09.320 --> 01:16.580
the last little while, a new song by a new artist every week, and I sometimes read the

01:16.580 --> 01:22.180
things you write towards me in our segment called Howlin' with Wolf.

01:22.180 --> 01:29.680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mads, at Medusa, but it's spelt all funny, who proudly

01:29.680 --> 01:33.140
hails from Sacramento, California.

01:33.140 --> 01:39.900
They tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a thing you can also do if

01:39.900 --> 01:42.100
you have a Twitter account.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.500
Mads writes,

01:43.620 --> 01:44.860
Hi, Wolf.

01:44.860 --> 01:51.500
This one goes out to the Neo Scum Discord and all the nasty little freaks in there whom

01:51.500 --> 01:54.100
I love more than I can put into words.

01:54.100 --> 01:59.820
Heck, I got matching tattoos with a bunch of you and I think that says it all.

01:59.820 --> 02:07.060
I refuse to give Cameron the satisfaction of a shout out by another scummer for getting

02:07.060 --> 02:12.940
so many of us to turn the dial to 694.2 PTBP.

02:12.940 --> 02:14.300
You hear that, Cam?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.300
Wait, shit.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.300
Wolf, cut that part.

02:16.300 --> 02:19.780
I can bribe you with some primo trash juice.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.500
Listen to Neo Scum.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.460
Neo Scum good.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.740
Anyway, here's Wonderwall.

02:25.740 --> 02:40.260
Hmm, Mads, Mads, Mads, Mads, trying to bribe me of all entities with trash juice?

02:40.260 --> 02:47.900
You think it's so simple to sway the emotions of a being such as I with such simple pleasures

02:47.900 --> 02:50.500
as primo trash juice?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.100
Well, you'd think right.

02:53.100 --> 02:58.500
Send that stanky dranky over here in at least a five gallon bucket.

02:58.500 --> 03:05.500
And don't you ever mention Wonderwall ever again.

03:05.500 --> 03:10.380
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter

03:10.380 --> 03:16.100
or Instagram, tag pretending to be people on Facebook or write up a five star review

on your podcast app of choice and send us the proof.

03:20.620 --> 03:26.860

04:03.620 --> 04:06.900
All can be found in the show notes.

04:06.900 --> 04:12.660
It takes me hours to write the show notes, so please would you go look at them?

04:12.660 --> 04:16.220
Now if you're just tuning in, welcome back.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.460
It's time for the news.

04:18.460 --> 04:25.580
Last time we caught up with the crew of the death of a salesman, Wavy Adler, Mr. Edward

04:25.580 --> 04:31.920
Spitz, Alabasta, Al Chernobog, and Dr. Shark.

04:31.920 --> 04:37.340
Now please imagine that meme where the girl explains things.

04:37.340 --> 04:43.740
So Wavy Adler is the ship's navigator, its eyes, while Mr. Spitz brings a bit of class

04:43.740 --> 04:46.420
to the pirate vessel, okay?

04:46.420 --> 04:52.340
Al Chernobog has a monkey and dripping open lesions all over.

04:52.340 --> 05:00.020
Also Dr. Shark was the saw bones, even sawed a leg off the cabin boy, Jurgen Stick, and

05:00.020 --> 05:02.780
got him fit for a peg leg.

05:02.780 --> 05:09.140
That gave Jurgen half the peg legs Dr. Shark left sticking out of the quicksand that had

05:09.140 --> 05:16.540
just consumed the dread pirate neck beard when he dove in head first to his single episode

05:16.540 --> 05:19.280
appearance based demise.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.500
Got all that?

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
Good.

05:21.500 --> 05:28.860
Join us now, back to the action on this island with a big ol' statue of a humanoid alligator

05:28.860 --> 05:35.780
and multiple narrow ditches filled with blood that seem to run all along the beach.

05:35.780 --> 05:40.860
It's R.I. Peter with Cruisin'!

06:05.780 --> 06:35.100
Oh, his feet ache, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my

07:05.100 --> 07:06.100
gosh.

07:06.100 --> 07:10.520
Is that like a, of course you were thinking about how much fun you would have there so

07:10.520 --> 07:11.520
you laughed.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.760
All of our listeners are in Hillsong, that are in Australia.

07:13.760 --> 07:14.760
Really?

07:14.760 --> 07:15.760
Yeah.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.760
Is Hillsong the name of a town?

07:16.760 --> 07:19.960
Yeah, on Patreon when it says location Australia Hillsong.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
Damn.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.320
It's the name of the country now actually.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
The whole country is Hillsong.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.060
Yeah, ever since that documentary came out and, the sound of music?

07:27.060 --> 07:28.060
Yeah.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.360
There were Nazis the whole time.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.720
Those were Hillsongs, right?

07:32.720 --> 07:34.140
Yes, they were.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.420
The Hills have songs.

07:37.420 --> 07:39.420
These hills have songs.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.020
These hills are alive with the sound of music.

07:42.020 --> 07:44.020
What did the guy say in Jason?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.020
Friday the 13th?

07:45.020 --> 07:46.020
It's a blood curse!

07:46.020 --> 07:47.020
It's a blood curse!

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
It's a blood curse!

07:48.020 --> 07:49.020
It's a blood curse!

07:49.020 --> 07:50.020
It's a blood curse!

07:50.020 --> 07:52.020
Shut up Ralph, you son of a bitch.

07:52.020 --> 07:55.420
You stupid fucking crazy bastard.

07:55.420 --> 07:56.420
Right off in the wrong way on a bike.

07:56.420 --> 08:00.220
You ought to be lucky the mental asylum fucking closed down or you'd be getting beat every

08:00.220 --> 08:01.780
day by Nurse Ratched.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.100
What was the captain of the neck beards name?

08:04.100 --> 08:05.100
Captain Neckbeard.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.100
Captain Neckbeard.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.100
Was that it?

08:07.100 --> 08:08.100
Yes.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
Nice.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.300
Yeah, remember we're going serious this time.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.580
Captain Neckbeard's dead, the rest of it's serious.

08:15.580 --> 08:21.860
The peg legs finally stop moving.

08:21.860 --> 08:31.500
The bubbles rising above where the dread pirate neck beard had gone under have ceased to bubble.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.900
And the crew from Neckbeard's ship ties their belts together.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.540
Wait, all together?

08:36.540 --> 08:39.380
Like to each other?

08:39.380 --> 08:40.380
Like in a circle?

08:40.380 --> 08:41.380
Yeah.

08:41.380 --> 08:42.380
Yep, to each other.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.340
This is gonna be tough crap boys.

08:45.340 --> 08:50.940
And then they hold each other's shoulders and begin walking back toward the beach.

08:50.940 --> 08:53.860
Are you Neckbeard's?

08:53.860 --> 08:55.860
You wait right there.

08:55.860 --> 08:56.860
Okay.

08:56.860 --> 08:59.740
Your captain just killed our doctor with his stupidity.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.100
Yeah, I'm real sorry about that.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.820
Wish YU is a doctor.

09:03.820 --> 09:10.260
The three of them all look at each other and let's roll luck, 50-50 shot up and down.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.780
Roll under, one of them's a doctor.

09:13.780 --> 09:14.780
10.

09:14.780 --> 09:15.780
10.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.260
That's a success.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.260
Is that a 10 or a 100?

09:18.260 --> 09:19.260
It's a 10.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.260
I can't see what the-

09:20.260 --> 09:21.260
It's a 10.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.260
No, 100 is all zeros.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.260
All zeros, yeah.

09:23.260 --> 09:24.260
It's a 10.

09:24.260 --> 09:25.260
It's a 10!

09:25.260 --> 09:26.260
Yeah!

09:26.260 --> 09:27.260
And I was actually gonna say-

09:27.260 --> 09:28.860
He's a fucking medical chap.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.860
Yeah, I actually-

09:30.860 --> 09:33.940
And the other two kind of move, try to shuffle behind him.

09:33.940 --> 09:34.940
But again-

09:34.940 --> 09:37.940
Yeah, they're all tied together by the belts.

09:37.940 --> 09:41.260
And so one of them's like, hey, it's schooling.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.260
He's lots of schooling.

09:42.260 --> 09:44.340
You should take him.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.340
I do sir.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.620
I have lots of schooling in medicine.

09:47.620 --> 09:51.380
I have 100 minus whatever you rolled is what I was gonna say.

09:51.380 --> 09:52.380
What's your name?

09:52.380 --> 09:53.380
I'm very, very skilled.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.380
What is your name?

09:54.380 --> 09:55.380
Jammin.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.380
Jammin?

09:56.420 --> 09:57.420
Jammin?

09:57.420 --> 09:59.420
Did you say, uh, Shammin?

09:59.420 --> 10:00.420
Did you say Jermaine?

10:00.420 --> 10:01.420
Yeah.

10:01.420 --> 10:05.660
How do you say it, sir?

10:05.660 --> 10:07.540
You're asking us to tell you how to say your name?

10:07.540 --> 10:08.540
Yes.

10:08.540 --> 10:09.540
I'm very scared right now.

10:09.540 --> 10:10.540
I think it's Jimmy.

10:10.540 --> 10:11.640
All right, Jimmy.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.640
He nods.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.940
You're coming with us.

10:14.940 --> 10:19.940
And he nods and he slowly looks down at his rope belt, which is tied to the others.

10:19.940 --> 10:25.700
You're all coming with us.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.020
Which one of you is the sword guy?

10:27.020 --> 10:29.020
I mean, I've got swords.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
Okay.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.180
I'll swing to try and cut him free from the other two.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.180
Oh, cool.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.860
Which one of you would be more likely to do a cool, yeah.

10:34.860 --> 10:38.940
I have like a knife that I can just cut the rope with.

10:38.940 --> 10:40.220
Who would do it cool?

10:40.220 --> 10:41.220
We're pirates.

10:41.220 --> 10:44.380
Mine's, mine's got a octopus beak on it.

10:44.380 --> 10:45.380
Can you beat that?

10:45.380 --> 10:46.380
How about this?

10:46.380 --> 10:47.380
How about this?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.820
We're going to have to cut it twice to get him out.

10:48.820 --> 10:49.820
You know?

10:49.820 --> 10:50.820
Oh, he's the one in the middle.

10:50.820 --> 10:51.820
Okay.

10:51.820 --> 10:52.820
Yeah.

10:52.940 --> 10:53.940
We'll throw at the same time.

10:53.940 --> 10:56.100
We'll show off these sword tricks.

10:56.100 --> 11:00.380
And if you don't do a good job, well then the doctor gets to show us how good his skills

11:00.380 --> 11:03.220
are, don't we?

11:03.220 --> 11:04.220
Don't pass mine.

11:04.220 --> 11:05.220
Oh, I pass mine.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.500
28 on a 70.

11:07.500 --> 11:12.460
Wavy pulls out his sword and he forgets to get the scabbard out, get it out of the scabbard,

11:12.460 --> 11:14.900
so he just hits the rope with the scabbard.

11:14.900 --> 11:18.540
That's embarrassing.

11:18.540 --> 11:25.500
He just reaches down and cuts the other side and looks at alabaster owl and is like, oh,

11:25.500 --> 11:29.460
it made me very nervous, sir.

11:29.460 --> 11:33.460
Alabaster stares at him for a second with like a questioning look and then he, he looks

11:33.460 --> 11:34.980
over at Mr. Spitz.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.980
Why, uh, why are we taking him again?

11:38.980 --> 11:40.620
He's a fucking sawbones, ain't he?

11:40.620 --> 11:45.220
Oh, is this not a deadly pirate competition fraught with danger?

11:45.220 --> 11:47.180
I forgot we lost our doctor.

11:47.220 --> 11:53.420
The rest of you, uh, go wade into the quicksand.

11:53.420 --> 11:55.500
The other two give you like massive eyes.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.780
Wait, there's only two other crew members?

11:57.780 --> 11:58.780
Yeah.

11:58.780 --> 11:59.780
Okay.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.780
I, yeah.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.700
Then I like, I'm not intimidated at all.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.980
I'm like expecting them to just wade into the quicksand.

12:04.980 --> 12:05.980
No.

12:05.980 --> 12:06.980
Oh God.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.980
No.

12:07.980 --> 12:10.160
If we could actually just go back to the ship, that'd be great.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.500
Just knee deep and you were here.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
Yeah.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.300
Maybe some more neck pads will come along.

12:15.420 --> 12:17.180
Maybe the jungle will take you.

12:17.180 --> 12:21.100
I don't think that we're gonna go anywhere without our captain.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.100
We're also supposed to, your captain's dead.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.100
Yes.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.100
So we're gonna leave, I guess.

12:25.100 --> 12:30.100
Uh, no, but you'll get back on the ship and try to fight us later cause the whole thing's

12:30.100 --> 12:31.460
a fight or something.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.580
So you need to get in the quicksand.

12:34.580 --> 12:39.140
You don't have to go all the way neck deep or, you know, head deep as your captain did,

12:39.140 --> 12:40.500
but you need to stay there.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.620
So fucking walk into the quicksand now.

12:43.620 --> 12:44.620
Eye roll, persuade.

12:44.620 --> 12:49.140
Sometimes it sounds like you're speaking with another man's words, but it really found

12:49.140 --> 12:50.140
like you found your voice there.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.140
Yeah, mine are bad on all this.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.140
Mine are bad.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.140
I got 15% intimidate.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.140
Oh my God.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.140
I rolled 100.

12:56.140 --> 13:05.260
Okay, they're both going to push past you physically.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.540
Like they're both going to shoulder check you as they walk past.

13:08.540 --> 13:13.580
And then basically as soon as they get past, they are going to run as fast as they can.

13:13.580 --> 13:14.580
What do you do?

13:14.580 --> 13:16.860
I throw one of my iron grenades at them.

13:16.860 --> 13:17.860
Jesus Christ.

13:17.860 --> 13:20.020
How many of those do you have?

13:20.020 --> 13:26.180
I literally, I like make them in the base or in the basement of the ship, which is called

13:26.180 --> 13:27.180
the?

13:27.180 --> 13:28.180
Anybody?

13:28.180 --> 13:29.180
The belly.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.180
The death of a salesman.

13:30.180 --> 13:31.180
Yeah, I don't know what it is either.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.180
The belly of the death of a salesman.

13:32.180 --> 13:35.700
Not the ship's name, but what is the basement of the ship called?

13:35.700 --> 13:36.700
The under deck.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.700
There's a number of different things.

13:37.700 --> 13:38.700
The inside.

13:38.700 --> 13:39.700
Below deck.

13:39.700 --> 13:40.700
I make it below deck.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.700
Yeah, basically you make it inside the ship.

13:43.260 --> 13:45.220
Can I roll heavy weapons on that?

13:45.220 --> 13:46.220
Yeah.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.220
Tight.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.220
Yeah, that's six.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.220
Okay.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.220
Yeah.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.220
As these two run off.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.220
Can I tell you what happens with a grenade?

13:52.220 --> 13:53.220
Please tell me what happens with a grenade.

13:53.220 --> 13:56.660
They bump into me and like shoulder check me and without even looking, I just kind of

13:56.660 --> 14:03.460
like throw it behind me and it doinks one of them in the, in the head and then it lands

14:03.460 --> 14:05.220
in front of them and they look down for a second.

14:05.220 --> 14:12.660
They look at each other and then you see these two bodies just kind of a red mist, it dissipates

14:12.660 --> 14:19.140
onto the leaves and all the foliage around as, as limbs just kind of fly around and the

14:19.140 --> 14:24.020
rest of you kind of turn around and you see that Mitch has taken his rope, everybody's

14:24.020 --> 14:30.580
got a rope and has been pulling out the body of Dr. Shark this whole time.

14:30.580 --> 14:36.020
He kind of got it around one of the peg legs and is pulled enough to where the whole body

14:36.020 --> 14:41.260
is coming out now and you see that Dr. Shark's head and specifically the ears are just completely

14:41.260 --> 14:46.320
caked with this quicksand and it is just packed in around the head.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.460
And then there were four or five, I don't, I'm not really clear on how many are competing

14:50.460 --> 14:51.460
in this.

14:51.460 --> 14:54.700
Well, we lost one doctor, but then we gained another and Jimmy so.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.540
But I mean the neckbeards are, the team is gone, right?

14:57.540 --> 15:03.340
Do we represent an advanced body of our crew or are they more aboard?

15:03.340 --> 15:08.380
It's like the captains of a football team coming out for the coin toss.

15:08.380 --> 15:09.900
We've crippled their leadership.

15:09.940 --> 15:14.860
Yeah, actually guys, this works out really well for you, no spoilers.

15:14.860 --> 15:20.820
He walks deeper into the forest jungle of this island and as he does, he turns around

15:20.820 --> 15:26.300
one of these trees that's in the distance and seems to be grabbing at something.

15:26.300 --> 15:32.700
And then as you approach, you see that he's putting on a cloak, like a black hooded cloak

15:32.700 --> 15:41.260
and it goes over his entire body and covers his head or over his eyes, Jedi style, but

15:41.260 --> 15:48.420
it is both short, it's short sleeved and it's, uh, it only comes up to about his thighs.

15:48.420 --> 15:50.140
You started motioning with your hands.

15:50.140 --> 15:54.460
No, I really thought you were going to like describe it as a crop top.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.000
Oh, that's my bad.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.820
It's absolutely a crop top.

15:59.820 --> 16:03.940
He actually removes his shirt before he puts on this crop top robe.

16:03.940 --> 16:05.260
He can be wearing it.

16:05.260 --> 16:09.380
They're going to be so angry if they found out that I wasn't wearing this before.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.940
So if you could just not say anything, that'd be awesome.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.300
And now you look good.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.460
What would you even call a garment like that?

16:17.460 --> 16:23.900
Oh, it's a, it's a crude, it's, it's a crude, like the movie, the crew.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.900
Yeah, it's a crudy.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.900
I love that movie.

16:25.900 --> 16:30.440
I saw it with my daughter that I don't have, cause it's my dream to have one.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.540
I thought about this movie that could be made.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.540
I like the backstory.

16:33.540 --> 16:36.820
How you became a Beatle.

16:36.820 --> 16:38.420
When I get, it's my dream.

16:38.420 --> 16:42.900
When I talk about my dreams, I think about me, favorite band, the world that could be

16:42.900 --> 16:46.180
my whole band and the favorite, my whole favorite band in the world.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.180
They sing.

16:47.180 --> 16:55.460
When I start to imagine, what should we do with the Eleanor Rigby, throw a silver lining.

16:55.460 --> 16:59.900
We shave a belly with a rusty razor.

16:59.900 --> 17:04.660
I raised the sails today, oh boy.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.660
And you guys walk further and further in.

17:06.660 --> 17:12.700
And as you're walking, you can see that, that pillar of smoke in the distance that you're

17:12.700 --> 17:19.400
walking toward, but you, you approach a clearing far before this, this pillar of smoke that's

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
in the distance.

17:20.400 --> 17:25.340
And in this clearing, we've established that we have tied Jimmy up and are leading them

17:25.340 --> 17:28.660
by his belt and the slashed belts of his comrades.

17:28.660 --> 17:29.660
You have now.

17:29.660 --> 17:30.660
Yes, absolutely.

17:30.660 --> 17:32.780
And how are you transporting the body of Dr. Shark?

17:32.780 --> 17:34.180
I thought Mitch was on that.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.180
Yeah.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.580
He's just been dragging the body.

17:36.580 --> 17:39.820
I didn't understand why he wanted it, but I, he said it would be advantageous.

17:39.820 --> 17:43.500
He just kind of kept the rope tied around it and just continues to drag it and he's

17:43.500 --> 17:50.900
just like, okay guys, Hey, I just want to say, um, before we get in there, you guys

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900
seem really cool.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.940
So I'm really rooting for you and I hope you win.

17:55.940 --> 17:56.940
Well, thank you, Mitch.

17:56.940 --> 17:57.940
That means a lot.

17:57.940 --> 18:07.740
Well, you're not going to, sorry, happy birthday, happy birthday, I didn't know it was your

18:07.740 --> 18:08.740
birthday, Mitch.

18:08.740 --> 18:09.900
Happy birthday.

18:09.900 --> 18:17.380
It's one of the Beatles birthdays, dude, just be a beetle, a beetle.

18:17.380 --> 18:21.100
You were doing the Australian, totally nailing it.

18:21.100 --> 18:28.220
You were in the, in the flow state, listen to his happy birthday, happy, happy birthday.

18:28.220 --> 18:33.780
I got to think about a guy that's really excited to talk about things and you're all back in

18:33.780 --> 18:34.780
it.

18:34.780 --> 18:40.780
I just got to be really excited about anything.

18:40.780 --> 18:46.100
Jimmy, are you not going to be our doctor?

18:46.100 --> 18:48.540
He's not excited about Jimmy not being a doctor.

18:48.540 --> 18:49.540
He's sad about it.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.900
Jimmy, are you going to be our doctor?

18:52.900 --> 18:59.740
My character asks Jimmy if he's going to be the doctor, uh, with his blade brandished.

18:59.740 --> 19:05.780
Jimmy smiles a wry smile that says that he's not intimidated by you at all.

19:05.780 --> 19:06.780
It can't be trusted.

19:06.780 --> 19:07.780
Wait, wait, wait.

19:07.780 --> 19:12.420
The intimidation rule failed, but then he obliterated those two dudes.

19:12.420 --> 19:13.420
You're absolutely right.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.420
You're absolutely right.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.420
We're still covered.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.380
Our backs are red with their blood.

19:18.420 --> 19:19.420
I'm so sorry.

19:19.420 --> 19:27.300
His lips tremble as he's like, whatever doctor you need to be, sir, anything that, you know,

19:27.300 --> 19:28.940
what's blood do?

19:28.940 --> 19:29.940
Yeah.

19:29.940 --> 19:30.940
What's blood?

19:30.940 --> 19:31.940
You tell us.

19:31.940 --> 19:32.940
I've always wondered that myself.

19:32.940 --> 19:33.940
What does blood do, doc?

19:33.940 --> 19:34.940
It flows.

19:34.940 --> 19:35.940
Why does it flow?

19:35.940 --> 19:37.860
Don't get clever with us.

19:37.860 --> 19:40.940
The brain makes it pump through the entire body.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.740
It's from your brain.

19:42.740 --> 19:46.420
That's where we think all of our thoughts and it's where all of our emotions come from.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.380
All right, then come from my belly.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.380
I believe him.

19:49.380 --> 19:50.980
He'll be a good doctor.

19:50.980 --> 19:56.780
Then I cut his vocal cords so he can't talk to us anymore.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.780
Are you intimidated now?

19:58.780 --> 20:07.980
I thought you were going to kill him so you didn't have to play this character.

20:07.980 --> 20:10.020
No, you should have a doctor.

20:10.020 --> 20:15.020
Oh, I thought you were, I thought you were going to be like, so I got to leave smiling

20:15.020 --> 20:16.020
because you failed.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.020
You're an intimidation checker here.

20:17.020 --> 20:18.020
Oh, okay.

20:18.020 --> 20:19.020
I'm an idiot then.

20:19.020 --> 20:20.020
I don't know.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.020
Thomas was right though.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.020
He's totally intimidated now.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.020
Yeah.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.020
Yeah, especially with his vocal cords cut.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.020
Yeah.

20:25.020 --> 20:32.860
And I realized, Alabaster realizes, wow, I can't believe I did surgery on his vocal cords.

20:32.860 --> 20:33.860
Maybe I'm a doctor.

20:33.860 --> 20:34.860
Let's not.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.580
I mean, do we want to do that or not?

20:36.580 --> 20:37.580
I don't want to.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.580
That's too ridiculous.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.580
Okay.

20:39.580 --> 20:40.580
Yeah.

20:40.580 --> 20:41.580
Yeah.

20:41.580 --> 20:44.180
Okay guys, let's um, let's go into the tower.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.900
Wait, is that Mitch or Jimmy?

20:45.900 --> 20:46.900
I'm Mitch.

20:46.900 --> 20:52.140
Jimmy talks like this sir, with his lips quivering and he always says sir at the end, sir.

20:52.140 --> 20:56.940
I'm Mitch and uh, we're going to the tower now, are you ready?

20:56.940 --> 21:01.020
Is the tower where the smoke's coming from or was that the thing we saw back at the beach?

21:01.020 --> 21:04.260
No, the tower is actually neither of those things.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.260
Oh my.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.260
Come with me.

21:06.260 --> 21:08.540
Should we be wearing a crude like you?

21:08.540 --> 21:16.660
And he opens up like a, uh, Oh, like a bead curtain, but it's a leaves and vines and stuff.

21:16.660 --> 21:22.860
And he opens it up into this clearing and you see, uh, you see another ditch immediately

21:22.860 --> 21:25.620
as soon as you're on the other side of the clearing.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.180
And this ditch is not filled with blood.

21:28.180 --> 21:32.760
It's filled with a clear liquid that one might assume is water.

21:32.760 --> 21:37.280
And that's not the only different thing about this ditch.

21:37.280 --> 21:44.840
This one, you can actually see where it continues on either side and it goes in a large circle,

21:44.840 --> 21:49.880
which is the circle of this clearing that exists here in the middle of this island in

21:49.880 --> 21:50.880
the jungle.

21:50.880 --> 21:52.600
So is it like right next to the edge of the trees and stuff?

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
Yes.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.600
It's a moat on the edge of the trees.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.600
Yeah.

21:55.600 --> 22:02.640
And just inside of that moat, uh, you see another moat and another and another, and

22:02.640 --> 22:06.880
they get smaller and smaller as they would as they go inside.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.920
And some are filled with water.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.040
Some are filled with blood.

22:11.040 --> 22:22.520
And Mitch, uh, turns you guys in, he's like, Oh yes, be mindful of the waterways and be

22:22.520 --> 22:33.280
mindful of, uh, the gutters and the trenches, all of these canals.

22:33.280 --> 22:40.640
And he looks out and in the middle of all of these pools, you see, there are a few other

22:40.640 --> 22:44.280
crudy wearing folks.

22:44.280 --> 22:49.760
There are three mean pirate camp counselors, mean pirate.

22:49.760 --> 22:50.760
I haven't seen this movie.

22:50.760 --> 23:00.120
It's going to be hard to, wait, what movie pirate camp doesn't exist, but we'll make

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
it.

23:01.960 --> 23:02.960
Pirate camp.

23:02.960 --> 23:09.760
You best stop leaving in pirate summer camps, you're in one.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.760
All right.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.600
Blue team to ultimate frisbee.

23:12.600 --> 23:19.560
One of them says from their crudy, no, I was so glad you said no, no, no, no.

23:19.560 --> 23:23.080
Mitch, Mitch gets really serious and is like, come this way.

23:23.080 --> 23:28.760
Wavy picks up what, what he's laying down and of course, master Mitch, I mean, master

23:28.760 --> 23:31.360
mysterious man, we will follow the lead.

23:31.360 --> 23:34.760
I've never had this guy's name ever in my life.

23:34.760 --> 23:42.680
The three crudy wearing folks turn and you see the tallest one has this like huge, massive

23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
jaw.

23:43.680 --> 23:50.040
And from underneath his hood, when, when you say that about Mitch, he gets a big smile

23:50.040 --> 23:54.880
on his face and the other two are still hidden by their crudy hoods.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.760
Are we talking like a strong jaw or like, like a radium lipstick?

23:59.760 --> 24:02.640
Like looks like you, you're not human kind of job.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
Oh, sorry.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
Human jaw.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
My bad.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.640
We're playing pulp Cthulhu.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.640
It's a human.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.640
I know it's human.

24:08.640 --> 24:12.960
It's not like, like you'd look at them and be like your jaws five times the size of somebody

24:12.960 --> 24:18.080
else's jaw, a monstrous job, alligator men.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.600
Hey, that's a real good point.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.720
So just like a chiseled jaw.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.720
It's like a chiseled jaw.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.720
Nice.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.720
So there's a real Chad in a, uh, a chode.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.720
What are we chud?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.720
We've got a Chad in a chud.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.720
It's real Chad in a chode.

24:35.720 --> 24:41.720
Mitch is leading the three of you as well as the body of Dr. Shark and Jimmy.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.720
The five of us.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.720
We're going to a weekend at Bernie's, Dr. Shark.

24:47.720 --> 24:55.720
And as you guys walk toward the center, you do see that there are five pools placed around

24:55.720 --> 24:56.720
the circle.

24:56.720 --> 25:02.720
The largest of these moats connects all five of these pools of water.

25:02.720 --> 25:11.720
And you would see that currently three of these pools are unvacant.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.720
Full.

25:17.720 --> 25:18.720
Not empty.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.720
Taken.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.720
They're lacking the emptiness.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.720
Occupied, full.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.720
Three of these pools are wet.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.720
Yes.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
Like filled with water.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.720
Filled with people.

25:30.720 --> 25:36.720
Uh, there are human bodies in three of them and the other two are empty.

25:36.720 --> 25:43.720
They are laying flat on their backs with their ears in the water, but their eyes and nose

25:43.720 --> 25:45.720
and mouth above water.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.720
Oh.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.720
From the distance here, can I see if any of them are alive or are they all dead on their

25:51.720 --> 25:52.720
backs?

25:52.720 --> 25:56.720
Go ahead and roll a medical check for intelligence.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
You're going intelligence?

25:58.720 --> 26:02.720
It's an eight on a intelligence of 70.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.720
Yeah, that'll do it.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.720
These three people are breathing.

26:04.720 --> 26:05.720
All three of them.

26:05.720 --> 26:06.720
Oh, it's only three.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.720
I thought each pool had a number of bodies in there.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.720
Yeah.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.720
I was imagining like bodies stacked on top of each other.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.720
Oh, my bad.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.720
Sorry.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.720
One person per pool.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
One person per pool.

26:16.720 --> 26:17.720
Not pools full of bodies.

26:17.720 --> 26:18.720
Nope.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.720
These pools are only big enough for one body to lay flat, almost like a pod.

26:22.720 --> 26:23.720
Gotcha.

26:23.720 --> 26:28.720
So full of bodies means that there are three holes filled with three bodies.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.720
There are three pods.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.720
Three pods full, two pods empty.

26:33.720 --> 26:34.720
Okay.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.720
They can't.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.720
Do these people in the pods look like pirates to us?

26:38.720 --> 26:39.720
Yeah.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
Edward Spitz does not cross himself for three bodies.

26:41.720 --> 26:42.720
He spits.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.720
Well, they all certainly seem relaxed.

26:47.720 --> 26:52.720
Well, yeah, because he hasn't communicated that he knows that they're breathing, I take

26:52.720 --> 26:57.720
a little bit of gunpowder out of my pocket and flick it on one of their faces to see

26:57.720 --> 26:59.720
if it moves with their breath.

26:59.720 --> 27:03.720
As you walk over there, the tall man in the middle says,

27:03.720 --> 27:07.720
Hey, Cielo, could you please not?

27:07.720 --> 27:10.720
If you could come this way, we must begin.

27:10.720 --> 27:11.720
He might much look bad.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.720
I keep the gunpowder in my pocket.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.720
And then I do what he asked me to do.

27:16.720 --> 27:23.720
We have spaced out this process between the crews in order to keep the violence offshore.

27:23.720 --> 27:27.720
Each crew will be given an orator.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.720
Each orator?

27:29.720 --> 27:33.720
And as he says orator, he motions at each side of him.

27:33.720 --> 27:41.720
Each orator will be positioned at the stern of each ship with only their barrel and their

27:41.720 --> 27:42.720
words.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.720
And he points and you see two barrels kind of at the edge of the jungle.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.720
Like a wine barrel?

27:47.720 --> 27:49.720
Yep, a full big wine barrel.

27:49.720 --> 27:56.720
Each orator will be positioned at the stern of each ship with only their barrel and their

27:56.720 --> 27:57.720
words.

27:57.720 --> 28:03.720
In order to win the competition, your orator must not be interrupted.

28:03.720 --> 28:09.720
A steady stream must come from both their mouth and their bong hole.

28:09.720 --> 28:18.720
The first crew to sail in a complete circle around the island will win a job that will

28:18.720 --> 28:23.720
earn so much wealth it would embarrass the queen.

28:23.720 --> 28:33.720
But each crew must leave a deposit here to ensure the safe return of our orators.

28:33.720 --> 28:38.720
And we just found out how you were originally going to have Beth May leave the podcast.

28:38.720 --> 28:47.720
It's a really good thing we kidnapped a bloke.

28:47.720 --> 28:53.720
Mitch, kind of out of the corner of his mouth is like, maybe keep your doctor and use the

28:53.720 --> 28:54.720
body.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.720
It's smart, we really could burn, is it?

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
Yeah.

28:57.720 --> 29:03.720
I pull a pair of pretty rad sunglasses out from my coat pocket and slip it on Dr. Shark.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.720
What are your sunglasses?

29:05.720 --> 29:11.720
They are how you disguise a body that is dead and make it look like it's alive and having

29:11.720 --> 29:13.720
a fun time all weekend.

29:13.720 --> 29:14.720
Two eye patches?

29:14.720 --> 29:17.720
Well, it's something that Alabaster was asked to make.

29:17.720 --> 29:19.720
What year did you say this was?

29:19.720 --> 29:20.720
I think there are sunglasses.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.720
I think Keith Richards wears them in the pirate movie.

29:25.720 --> 29:33.720
No, Dr. Spitz asked me, Mr. Spitz asked me to make something to block the sun and I made

29:34.720 --> 29:43.720
out of broken brown bottles, I crafted you some Oakley looking futuristic glasses.

29:43.720 --> 29:51.720
So I put those on me and then out of Dr. Shark's 1920s coat jacket, I pull a pair of sunglasses

29:51.720 --> 29:53.720
and put them on Dr. Shark.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.720
It works.

29:55.720 --> 30:00.720
Look at this contraption I found, it'll block the eyes, you can't see the maggots coming

30:00.720 --> 30:02.720
out of them.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.720
This will be your orator.

30:05.720 --> 30:11.720
He motions to one of the two crudy wearing folk and she begins to walk.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.720
Shotgun Mitch, we shawty Mitch.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.720
We'd like to have Mitch as our...

30:14.720 --> 30:15.720
We want Mitch.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.720
Mitch, Mitch, he's our man.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.720
Mr. Mystery Men.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.720
If they can't do it, no one can.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.720
I'm excited so, no, I'm not excited so I'm talking like this.

30:22.720 --> 30:28.720
Mitch and the woman who moved forward to be your orator both turn and look at the tall

30:28.720 --> 30:30.720
man and the crudy.

30:31.720 --> 30:38.720
Mitch, do you know the words?

30:38.720 --> 30:40.720
Mitch, do you know the words?

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
Sir, I do.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.720
I put a gun to Mitch's back.

30:43.720 --> 30:47.720
I whisper in his ear, do you know the words, boy?

30:47.720 --> 30:48.720
Very cool.

30:48.720 --> 30:53.720
He turns back and he's talking to you while the large man is talking.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.720
Mitch whispers like, yes, very quickly.

30:56.720 --> 31:03.720
And the large man says, well, then if you would like to go with him, you may.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.720
We'd love to have you.

31:04.720 --> 31:12.720
Oh, that's like the words that Mitch has been wanting to hear his entire life.

31:12.720 --> 31:17.720
He turns in like his hood bounces kind of off of his head a little bit as he turns and

31:17.720 --> 31:22.720
flashes you just a massive smile full of warmth and joy.

31:22.720 --> 31:27.720
And he turns back and he says, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.720
Sure, sure.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.720
I can do it.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.720
I'm proud of you, son.

31:33.720 --> 31:42.720
While this is happening, I like discreetly in one of his hands give him one of my grenades

31:42.720 --> 31:43.720
for later.

31:43.720 --> 31:47.720
To kill yourself if you can't do it and the shame is too much.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.720
No, for protection later maybe or to help us.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.720
From the shame.

31:52.720 --> 31:56.720
Can Waverly clock the other person?

31:56.720 --> 32:01.720
So we've got big man, woman, clock the other person and see if I see a familiar relation

32:01.720 --> 32:02.720
between all of them.

32:02.720 --> 32:03.720
Cool.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
Is that spot hidden?

32:04.720 --> 32:05.720
Yeah.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.720
It's a 38 and I got that special thing.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.720
So let's see if I roll better.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.720
Nope.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.720
Did you pass?

32:11.720 --> 32:12.720
Did you pass?

32:12.720 --> 32:13.720
Yeah, pass.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.720
Sorry, pass on the first one.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.720
Rad.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.720
Yeah.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.720
So this is the Diggory family.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.720
You recognize the Diggory family.

32:19.720 --> 32:20.720
Cedric Diggory?

32:20.720 --> 32:21.720
Holy shit.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.720
They're wearing robes too.

32:22.720 --> 32:24.720
I didn't even think of that.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.720
Are we going to fight a dragon?

32:26.720 --> 32:30.720
No, but Voldemort's going to kill you.

32:30.720 --> 32:34.720
The Diggory family is extremely well known.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
Oh shit.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.720
Very, very wealthy and have been missing for some time.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.720
Do we know of a Mitch Diggory?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.720
Oh, the Diggory family.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.720
Doc.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.720
The person.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.720
The Diggory family, Robinson.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.720
The Diggory family doc is where we're parked.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.720
Yeah, that is where we're parked.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.720
Incredible.

32:56.720 --> 33:01.720
I love the idea of a very wealthy family all out here in their shitty fucking crop top

33:01.720 --> 33:02.720
hoodies.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.720
Yep.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
Like putting on pirate games.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
Am I imagining this wrong?

33:05.720 --> 33:06.720
They've got a hood, right?

33:06.720 --> 33:07.720
Yep.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.720
But their face is a little bit shown.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.720
Yeah, their eyes are being covered for the most part.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.720
Got it.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
Except for-

33:13.720 --> 33:14.720
This is hilarious.

33:15.720 --> 33:21.720
As far as age goes, it's mother, father, and then brother and or sister.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.720
We haven't clocked to the third one.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.720
Yeah, the other one is a sister.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.720
Okay.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.720
So mother, father, son.

33:27.720 --> 33:32.720
I know you said they were black hoodies or a black hood, but I'm just picturing Heather

33:32.720 --> 33:33.720
Grey.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.720
I don't know who Heather Grey is.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.720
The color?

33:36.720 --> 33:37.720
The color.

33:37.720 --> 33:38.720
I'm kidding.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.720
I was confused.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.720
I thought that was Grey's Anatomy name or something.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
That's Dr. Grey.

33:44.720 --> 33:48.720
Yeah, but her sister is maybe Helen.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.720
There is a tension hanging in the air right now.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.720
Are we the last to arrive?

33:53.720 --> 33:54.720
No, actually.

33:54.720 --> 33:59.720
And he clocks that your doctor is from a seemingly different crew based on spatial hair.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.720
Because he's got a neck beard.

34:01.720 --> 34:08.720
Mitch says, Captain neck beard drowned on the way in due to some quicksand.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.720
I'd call it more like choking.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.720
Or like a suffocation, maybe?

34:12.720 --> 34:17.720
Yeah, like he got the earth itself inside his lungs, and then it grabbed him and wouldn't

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
let go.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.720
Then yes, you are the last.

34:20.720 --> 34:32.720
And he looks at the wife and the daughter with a certain amount of worry and extreme

34:32.720 --> 34:34.720
joy.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.720
Alabaster raises his hand.

34:36.720 --> 34:37.720
Oh, yes.

34:37.720 --> 34:40.720
I love a well mannered sea pirate.

34:40.720 --> 34:43.720
Would you say you're the authority around these parts?

34:43.720 --> 34:44.720
Yes, of course.

34:44.720 --> 34:50.720
Okay, then can we have Captain Neckbeard's ship just tag along with us and help us out?

34:50.720 --> 34:55.720
I tell you what, if you win today, you can have everyone else's ships.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.720
Well, I was thinking more for the competition.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.720
Yeah.

34:58.720 --> 35:05.720
I don't want to take credit for what your island has done, but we killed them basically.

35:05.720 --> 35:09.720
And so we are already winning the game, I think, as far as I see it.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.720
Yeah, we had the opportunity to help and we did nothing.

35:12.720 --> 35:21.720
In fact, we let him drown and our doctor, nevermind, we let him drown.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.720
Don't worry about our guys.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.720
Yeah, we thought we should have two doctors and that would be smart.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.720
That's why we got a fellow with the funny looking glasses.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.720
He's like on your shoulder now.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.720
He's between me and Mitch, I imagine.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.720
And Edward says that.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.720
Also, that's not a neckbeard.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.720
He just can't grow over it.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.720
He's not part of the crew.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.720
He just can't.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.720
Also, Captain Neckbeard said we could have his ship and use it for the competition as

35:47.720 --> 35:51.720
he was suffocating or choking or drowning, whatever.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.720
You're making quite the seafarers case, Cindy.

35:54.720 --> 36:02.720
I honestly couldn't care less as long as the stream from the bungalow is never cut.

36:02.720 --> 36:07.720
All right, well, if we got two ships, could we get your wife as a second orator in a second

36:07.720 --> 36:08.720
bungalow?

36:08.720 --> 36:09.720
Yes, of course.

36:09.720 --> 36:14.720
And the woman walks toward you as well, solemnly, almost hesitantly.

36:14.720 --> 36:21.720
As soon as somebody like of that social stature is anywhere near Mr. Spitz, he like very comically

36:21.720 --> 36:24.720
bows and his shitty wig falls off.

36:25.720 --> 36:33.720
She looks at you and she says, it's time to deposit your collateral.

36:33.720 --> 36:37.720
She points at one of the pools on the outside of this clearing.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.720
Yeah, Lady Diggery, as you can see, our talker is sleeping one off here.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.720
So me and your boy Mitch are going to help him over to his hole.

36:44.720 --> 36:48.720
Any problem, you won't hear a peep out of him this whole time, I'd imagine.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.720
Yep, she rolled a 90.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.720
She doesn't even listen to people like of our...

36:55.720 --> 36:56.720
Oh God, not at all.

36:56.720 --> 37:02.720
She's already turned around and is looking deeply into her husband's eyes and saying goodbye.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.720
I hit play on the boombox that makes the doctor dance his way over to the pool.

37:08.720 --> 37:16.720
Mr. Spitz and Mitch Diggery walk over with the body of Dr. Shark and place him gently

37:16.720 --> 37:24.720
into this pool and his ears are in the water, his eyes, nose and mouth are above

37:24.720 --> 37:35.720
and this quicksand that was all gummed up the works of his head begins kind of mixing with the water.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.720
Yes sir, do you believe it is time to begin?

37:38.720 --> 37:43.720
The other ships are waiting, you will see the smoke will change color

37:43.720 --> 37:46.720
and that is how you will know to begin the race.

37:46.720 --> 37:53.720
Remember, a perfect circle, not perfect in shape so much as complete.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.720
One end must come to the other, do you understand?

37:57.720 --> 38:03.720
We could send the ships two different ways, we get there twice as fast.

38:03.720 --> 38:08.720
I don't know if we can trust them, they've not got a captain.

38:08.720 --> 38:12.720
It is a matter of who we put on that other ship to make sure that they follow our instructions.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.720
That's true.

38:13.720 --> 38:21.720
It does also have to be a clean circle from one bunghole, each bunghole.

38:21.720 --> 38:27.720
I think maybe we use their ship as a defense, like a shield from the others.

38:27.720 --> 38:33.720
But also with the second bunghole and the other one, we've got insurance in case our bunghole,

38:33.720 --> 38:36.720
anything happens to it, go for it Mitch.

38:36.720 --> 38:41.720
I think if anything gets fired at us though, we have that protecting us because those men

38:41.720 --> 38:46.720
to me didn't know about them yesterday, won't know about them tomorrow.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.720
If they die, they die.

38:47.720 --> 38:48.720
Oh, you mean the neckbeards?

38:48.720 --> 38:49.720
Yes, absolutely.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.720
Not our crew.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.720
I agree.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.720
Not our crew that I could name every single one of them if you asked me to.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.720
Every, all, all of them.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.720
I know there's a certain number but...

39:00.720 --> 39:03.720
As any of us could, name all ninety souls aboard.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.720
I'm not great at counting.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.720
Well it was ninety.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.720
And listen, I don't care about the neckbeards none either, all of them smell like cum.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.720
I heard that mate.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.720
No offense Dr. Jimmy.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.720
No, none taken sir.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.720
And he looks down at his well encrusted...

39:21.720 --> 39:24.720
They pleasure themselves most terribly.

39:24.720 --> 39:28.720
It's awful, it's awful what they do as he covers himself.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.720
No strumpets will come aboard.

39:30.720 --> 39:34.720
So should we head back to the ships and depart?

39:34.720 --> 39:36.720
I'd say so my Australian friend.

39:36.720 --> 39:42.720
On the way back, Alabaster, he feels pretty uncomfortable with like, just having left

39:42.720 --> 39:48.720
the dead body of his like, Dr. Shark is taking care of him like, kept him alive and so he

39:48.720 --> 39:54.720
just watched that whole thing go down and was like, uncomfortable but he sings this

39:54.720 --> 39:59.720
little lullaby that Dr. Shark used to sing to him.

39:59.720 --> 40:04.720
Hmm...

40:04.720 --> 40:07.720
Hmm...

40:07.720 --> 40:12.720
Dr. Shark did-did-did Dr. Shark did-did-did

40:12.720 --> 40:14.720
Dr. Shark did-did-did-did

40:14.720 --> 40:15.720
Dr. Sh-

40:59.720 --> 41:03.720
Early in the mornin'

41:03.720 --> 41:05.720
Sittin' in his belly with a rusty razor

41:05.720 --> 41:07.720
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

41:07.720 --> 41:09.720
Shave his belly with a rusty razor

41:09.720 --> 41:11.720
Early in the mornin'

41:11.720 --> 41:13.720
Hey, and up she rises

41:13.720 --> 41:15.720
Hey, and up she rises

41:15.720 --> 41:17.720
Hey, and up she rises

41:17.720 --> 41:19.720
Early in the mornin'

41:19.720 --> 41:21.720
Oh, that's the end of it

41:21.720 --> 41:23.720
That's how we do it with the junkins

41:23.720 --> 41:25.720
Early in the mornin'

41:25.720 --> 41:27.720
This is like a five, uh

41:27.720 --> 41:29.720
Five paragraph essay, like

41:29.720 --> 41:31.720
Tell them what you're gonna tell them

41:31.720 --> 41:33.720
Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them

41:33.720 --> 41:35.720
Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them

41:35.720 --> 41:37.720
That's what we do with the drunken sailor
