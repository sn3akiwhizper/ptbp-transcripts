0	9260	Well, well, well. It's one episode after the nice episode. Time to get more somber, I guess.
9260	19660	Psych! It's always 69 o'clock here at 694.2 PTPB, my babies. Now, it may be episode 70,
19660	26260	but when you're with me, Wolf the Dog, it always feel like some kinda 69 could happen
26260	34660	at any time. You can feel that extra nice energy still lingering in the air. Very nice.
34660	40700	I wonder if y'all can feel it 26 years in the past. But let's jump to the present, even
40700	46980	though you're listening in the past. Hoo boy, this is confusing, y'all.
46980	53040	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Atkull Underdash Saridwin, who tweeted about the
53040	58180	show and tagged that pretendin' pod. It's really that simple, y'all, and it makes ol'
58180	61340	Wolfie oh so happy. They write,
61340	67540	Hey guys, heard about this weird little game number called Coffee Punk. Apparently it's
67540	75240	about a bunch of punks on rollerblades stealing coffee from The Man. Go on over to At Neon
75240	81580	Dreams 8 on the Twitter and check him out. Well, I can't wait to strap on some blades
81580	87860	and roll roll roll away, but the only coffee I like is the kind that has been sittin' out
87860	94200	for way too long. The kind you microwave to heat back up, but you know it's never gonna
94200	99420	be the same. Something's changed inside of it. A darkness looms.
99420	105660	But anyway, it sounds like a damn blast. Go have fun stompin' on The Man and stealin'
105660	112260	all the coffee, ya punks. We make this show to feed our insatiable egos. If you've listened
112260	118540	this far, please reach out and tell us what you like about the show. Here at 694.2, we
118540	125420	thirsty. Give us some sloppy love at Pretendin' Pod on Twitter and Instagram and write a soppin'
125420	133300	wet review on Apple Podcasts. And you know what? We hungry too. Feed us over at patreon.com
133300	139180	slash pretendin' pod. You can get access to some sweet, sweet bonus content.
139180	144900	This shit is gettin' outta hand, but really no quicker than reality. Strap in for a mood
144900	151340	killer, it's time for the news. James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground,
151340	157780	got inside the dreams or memories of our four PCs. Then they were in a bit of a canoe race.
157780	162580	The Grimes took the lead while Jack Russell had a mental break, leaving him and Bradley
162580	168700	Cooper at the back of the pack. But before that concluded, the four PCs and Alan Grimes
168700	174340	were standing in a seemingly infinite room full of shelves filled with audio cassettes.
174340	181580	For some of our greener listeners here at 694.2 PTBP, an audio cassette is a physical
181580	187900	object made of plastic and polyester type plastic film with a magnetic coating. Most
187900	195100	of them hold between 46 and 120 minutes of audio. The names on these cassettes were those
195100	202700	of many politicians, CEOs, activists, journalists, religious figures, as well as a group consisting
202700	209620	of Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, Alan Grimes, Walter Grimes, and Martin Cupertino. I'd say
209620	214940	it's about time for these PCs to wake the fuck up. Personally, one of my favorite things
214940	218980	in the morning times is dream girl with pretty sexual.
244940	259260	I pooped in my pants. So we got a comment on the question and answer
259260	265980	thread on the subreddit over at r slash pretending to be people on Reddit. And we had it up 109
265980	272100	days ago, but we recently got a comment that says the town only has one radio station and
272100	276620	it's DJ plays the same song over and over and over again. Does that contribute to the
276620	283180	town's low sanity? Does the station schedule include a top 40 show and is it no backbone
283180	288260	40 times? What is he talking about? Yeah. Wolf the dog.
288260	291420	He brings me a new song every day. Who is Wolf the dog?
291420	295700	EJV is a dope new song every time I hear him. Brand new premier.
295700	300620	Did you hear last week he played no backbone? That was so tight. I can't wait to see what
300620	305980	you're up to. As soon as I heard it, I downloaded it. Yeah. You should go to Spotify. Check
305980	313140	out kudzu, a band that a Wolf, the dog just discovered last week and shared with us. Well,
313140	318060	let's not fail to mention the dream girl actual other song. So check out dream girl. Check
318060	322340	out someone still loves you. Boris yells, someone's on a couple episodes and that's
322340	327780	that band is Primo. We got blue false and to go. Oh yeah. That was a really good, those
327780	332220	are the, I think those are that arc. Oh, in that thread. Uh, yeah, I think in one of
332220	337700	the Patrion episodes I mentioned a band that I went on tour with free at last. They're
337700	345520	fine. Go listen to them. I, when I saw that, I, uh, hadn't listened to them in a long time
345520	351680	and, uh, went to their band camp and I forgot that the album artwork is pretty dope by an
351680	357800	artist from Ozark, Missouri named Tim Peacock who, uh, now works for the new Yorker. Oh
357800	362760	shit. Yeah, that's cool. It's a funny name. Tim Peacock. I like it. Yeah, it's good. From
362760	375040	Guadalajara. What? He's from Guadalajara. Oh, is that in Ozark? No, that's in Mexico. Right
375040	385600	next to the shitty little downtown they have downtown's. Okay. It's okay. It's not a downtown.
385600	394600	There's a town square. There's a bank, a courthouse. Um, there is a little placard that tells about
394600	399280	the time that they hung the bald numbers there. Oh, well those people were bad. Okay, so we
399280	406120	need to do a roll off. All people aren't bad. Hey, I hope not. What if I just become evil as
406120	412160	soon as I shave my head? You have been getting a lot more nefarious. Hey, quick question though.
412160	420480	That's just cause I'm sadder. I liked my hair. Fucking judge me. I liked it too when it was
420480	435160	there. I just going back to the ball numbers. I ain't got no hair no more. Okay, so we need to do
435160	440200	a roll off and this is will matter for the game that we're playing. So you're all going to roll
440200	448120	off against each other against 50 and if you get under 50 pass and if you all pass, whoever rolls
448160	455200	lowest loses. How many rerolls do we get? Go through the rounds and if you, if you roll over
455200	462080	50 then whoever rolls highest overall will lose. So let's start with Thomas. We'll go around 32.
462080	477880	Oh, that's good. Luke. No, I'm saving my luck for me. 74. Oh, 74 Justin. 93. That's going to be
477880	486960	difficult. Yeah, you can do it. Get higher than a 93. It's a 49. All right. He is right on the
486960	494200	money. Best role and Justin had the worst role, so I'll keep that in mind moving forward for this
494200	500320	game. That sounds, he's just going to treat Justin a little worse. Wait, so mine was best
500320	509040	personally. Yeah. Well, I'm sad now. You're at the calm, comfy campgrounds. You should be,
509040	514920	how could you be anything? But wait, was that Justin rolling or Charlie Charles? It's a,
514920	522600	it was just a really great point. What is your name now again? Martin Scorsese. Martin Cupertino.
522600	529040	Cupertino. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. It's a really cool fake name to pair with Bradley Cooper. Are
529040	536000	we recording right now? I'm asking because you're getting up. I didn't know if you forgot
536000	543240	to precariously perched a glass right behind you. I'm going to go ahead and drink this mango orange
543240	554240	juice down so it doesn't spill. Where are we recording? Martin Cupertino wakes up. I need
554240	567520	you to roll a constitution check. Yes. Crit success. Critical success. 44 on a 55. You
567520	576440	feel so strange, like something within you has changed. Like Martin Cupertino is very aware of
576440	582960	how his engine runs. And you know, I didn't spend the last 15 years mastering Transcendental
582960	589040	Buddhism to not be in touch with my inner workings. But you have so much control that
589040	596120	you can keep down anything like strange or painful about how you feel currently. Like you feel almost
596120	601840	like, you know, when you're so hungry that you feel like you're going to like pass out. Yeah.
601840	611280	That's essentially how you feel. And you realize that your left arm is throbbing. And when you look
611280	619760	down, you see that you have a little bit of dried blood right in the crook of your elbow. Like I'd
619760	625320	been hooked up to a, like they were taking my blood. Something like that. Or an IV or something.
625320	631440	Yeah. Yeah. It left a little mark and you feel pretty weird. All right, Martin. Odds are you've
631440	635800	been drugged, but you've got your wits about you critically. I want to look around the room. Yeah,
636440	641840	did I wake up in my bedroom? Yeah, you did. Okay. So I mean, that's, that's all I want to know,
641840	650320	I guess. But I rolled 99. That's fantastic. What is this? Where am I? As you get ready,
650320	657320	how, what is your, what does your morning routine look like? Martin wakes up at like 4.30 AM. He
657320	662440	makes a smoothie. So when you go downstairs on your way to make your smoothie, did you put the
662440	670120	floorboard back? Yes. It is removed. You don't notice it and you kind of trip and your leg goes
670120	677720	into the hole. I need you to roll a D4. What? You just lose one hit point, but you like wang your
677720	684400	ankle to the point to where you have to, like, you can't walk quite normally. Well, that's okay. I'm
684400	688880	about to do my stretches. So probably work that out. Smoothie and stretches? Smoothie and stretches.
689720	695400	That's Martin's time. Does it feel like the right time of day for him to be waking up? It does. Okay.
695400	701160	Then about two minutes after he actually wakes up, his little digital watch starts beeping and he's
701160	711520	like, beat you again. Did this, uh, did this night of maybe not quite rest, uh, give you any? Well,
711520	715800	it's the last thing I remember being in the room with all the tapes. Vaguely, but it's almost like
715840	721680	that memory along with countless others are consistently swirling around in your head. Does
721680	727080	it feel more like I just woke up after my first day? Yeah. This place is weird. I want to do a
727080	733160	physical like inventory of myself. Okay. You said I feel weird. It looks like a needle's been in me.
733160	736840	Yeah. How do I feel weird? Do I feel like I've been drugged or anything? A little bit. Like,
736840	743800	uh, just a little hard to focus or a little out of it. Okay. So you remember how last night when
743800	749520	you were pulling up the floorboard and stuff, you were trying to think of how you got to calm,
749520	755080	comfy campground and it like tripped you out that you had no memory of even like the boat ride to
755080	765320	the Island or anything like that. Now you know full well that you have absolutely no memory of
765320	771840	getting here or even finding out about calm, comfy campground, all the memories of your friends
771840	778400	telling you that you needed to get help seem off in some strange way, how you found out about calm,
778400	787840	comfy campground. That memory itself is warped. Roll sanity. Critical success. 22. Wow. Yes. Yes.
787840	795440	Okay. So, uh, with that, uh, not only do you know that this is your second day at calm,
795440	799920	comfy campground, but you also know full well that it's not. Looks like the world's finally
799920	803680	catching up to the possibilities of my kind of thinking. I'll have to figure out what the,
803680	808040	what kind of time dilation device they've got going on here, but in my really helping
808040	812200	cube or something, you know, someone gets in a, an online game or really as I don't know,
812200	816760	I think it could be handy. You can make people work forever in a time where they're stuck.
816760	827480	He's hard. Is so the, the, the floorboard was open. Yeah. Was the stuff gone? Interestingly
827880	832880	enough, everything that you took out of the bag is still with you or where you put it,
832880	837360	but the bag itself is gone and everything you left in the bag is gone with it. So you
837360	842040	still have the cassettes and the map. I was listening to the episode and I completely
842040	845800	spaced the syringe that was in there. Do I feel like that's a possibility for what I
845800	850720	got injected with? I mean, I'd like to start looking around the corners of my room for cameras.
850840	863520	Okay. Yeah. Roll search 58 on a 20, even though you have this weird out of place memory of finding
863520	870120	out that you were being watched, you kind of think that maybe that memory is faulty because
870120	877840	there are no cameras in this cottage. Like turn my TV on, go for it. And flipping around and you
877840	883120	get normal channels. Interesting. Not as interesting as watching me presumably, but this is interesting.
883120	888160	I've never really watched TV. It's for weak minded individuals. There's a commercial for a
888160	894520	mattress place. Come on down to Leroy's mattresses. We got the finest place where you can put your
894520	906200	head down on a bed. Sounds about right. I click it off. Walter, you wake up and Alan is looking
906240	915760	right at you. And he's like, how do you feel? Roll constitution. 21 on a 60. You feel fine,
915760	923200	but you know something with your system is wrong. And he grabs your arm and he holds it out. And you
923200	929640	see on the inside of your elbow pit, there's a little mark where some dried blood is there.
929640	937080	And he holds out his arm as well. And he's like, what is going on? Were you down all night? I,
937080	945440	the last thing I remember is, uh, well, I was in a canoe with you and then we were at like a,
945440	950560	Oh my God. We had to put the shelves, the metal shelves. Were we at a music store or no, we were,
950560	956280	we were with the, the floor was made of blight. It was like that scene in the matrix. Oh my God.
956280	965040	What was that? Were we there? Did you have that same dream? Is there any way for me to do a
965040	970040	systems check on myself by rolling constitution, which you already did. So you know that something
970040	980240	is off, but I can't like have like a printout. No, but you do know that something, something is
980240	988200	strange because those memories that are part of your dreams, maybe with Alan having the same
988200	994600	dream, you, you, you start to realize maybe, Oh fuck, this isn't, this isn't the second day that
994600	1001560	you've been to calm, comfy campground. It's not the second day. Something is, but linear timeline
1001560	1011480	should tell me that it should be the second day. Yeah. Roll sanity. Ought one. Holy shit. Verified.
1011480	1018840	I don't, my computer doesn't work that way, so I'm not freaked out. I am alarmed though. Yeah.
1018840	1025200	Can I do a medicine or something like for not first, maybe medicine to feel Alan's pulse and
1025320	1032320	see if his heart rate is normal and see if do like a overall check to see if the not armpit,
1032320	1039440	but elbow pit is the only thing off. Oh yeah. Yeah. You can. Oh yes. Yes. Please, please give me
1039440	1048680	up. Give me a physical and you guys can take your time. 89. Oh yeah. I had three. Yes. Yes,
1048680	1056440	of course. So Alan Grimes just begins looking high and low through this cottage. He's like,
1056440	1062720	someone must have been in here. I have an idea. And I go over to the television and start scrolling
1062720	1069440	through channels. Um, when I turn it on, is it still tuned into, um, Bradley Cooper, Martin
1069440	1074840	Cupertino? No, it is not. What is it on when I turn it on? It's on Price is Right. Okay.
1074840	1087320	But I'm on stage is a bookshelf, a TV stand with a brand new television and, um, some leather
1087320	1097040	couches. Sure. Uh, uh, lazy boys. Yeah. 37 59. And then I start scrolling through. Yeah. And as you
1097040	1102120	scroll through, you find just completely normal channels that you get like right outside the
1102120	1109760	city. But when you come back to wheel of fortune, it pops up 37 50 prices, right? Yes. Sorry. I
1109760	1115760	thought you were saying the price was right, which it was 37 59. You said, well, you would have gone
1115760	1124240	over. Yes. I hear that now. No, I said 37 59. That's that's what pops up. Cause I know I've
1124360	1132320	studied catalogs. Um, anyway, so I can't find any security footage. No, no longer here. Oh, you,
1132320	1137840	you booked for cameras about how many channels are there? Like just average. Okay. I want to do a
1137840	1144880	search role to see if there's a camera in our cabin. Yeah, for sure. A neural search pass with
1144880	1155440	a six on a 36. I think I wrote over that without erasing it. So, and I'm going to add seven. Nice.
1155440	1162240	So as you're looking around, not only do you find more than one camera, you find like four cameras,
1162240	1167400	all posted up in different rooms. You find microphones. Are they like hidden? Like,
1167400	1172680	yes. Supposed to be discreet. Yes. They are quite discreet. And you find microphones hidden in
1172800	1180840	different objects around the rooms. And you also find a shoe print that is quite small,
1180840	1187600	like muddy footprint or like dirt, something. I'm going to, and it is at the front door. When
1187600	1194240	I find those, I'm going to keep them in place as to not arouse suspicion. Sure. Go ahead and
1194240	1198920	roll stealth to see if you can like find them without, if someone was watching what they
1198920	1205000	realized. Damn. I'm rolling good today. Four on a, I assume 30. Yeah. Yeah. So you can,
1205000	1212160	Adam. Oh, hell yeah. So you can see all of those different cameras and microphones without the
1212160	1217920	cameras and microphones realizing. Okay. I'm immediately going to go over to Alan and non
1217920	1229240	verbally, like he's pointing. Sorry. This is an audio medium. I point at like where the cameras
1229240	1234760	are. Yeah. And I point at like where the microphones are. And I, you do it in a way that
1234760	1243640	is very discreet. Yeah. But to convey, yeah. So I, oh my gosh. What, what do you want per
1243640	1249400	pool? It's pretty nice outside today. Maybe we should take a walk. I think that's a very good
1249400	1255800	idea. Okay. We go outside and yeah, we get five or six steps away from the front door and I'm like,
1255800	1261680	what is, what is going on here? I have no idea. This is, this is untenable. I, how, how did you
1261680	1270680	find this place? Why? I know why we came here, but how did you find this particular place? Did
1270760	1281120	you use your AOL CD rom? Oh, hell yeah. Alan rolled some dice for sanity, failed miserably.
1281120	1288240	Oh, Oh no. Walter, Walter, the more that I go back into my mind, the more that I'm realizing,
1288240	1294400	I don't think that. Do you remember? Do you remember coming here? He's got his hands on his
1294400	1300280	head and he's looking at you with massive eyes. Do you, do you remember coming to this Island?
1300280	1310800	I, well, we would have had to get here when he showed us that the first thing I remember is that
1310800	1316560	we were just standing at the, on the Island and we walked up the, we walked up the pathway. I
1317520	1325000	assumed maybe I was shut down for the ride here. And then you woke me up when, when we got here.
1325000	1332640	Oh, I, I can't even, I saw an ad. I thought I saw an ad, but when I go back to that memory,
1332640	1338560	I, I, the ad for calm company campground, it's all swirling. It's all, it's all a part of the
1338560	1344480	same. Oh, the memory is, and you just see his head kind of hang. And it's the first time you've seen
1344480	1361280	your father without full confidence in himself. That freaks me out. Oh my God. My computer
1361280	1368760	doesn't compute. This just doesn't make much sense. I, so in the dream, well, I don't know
1369000	1377320	if it was a dream or not. If we were actually there when, when I saw Brad piece of shit's name
1377320	1385400	is Martin. When we saw him on the television, he had tapes from there. Do you think he's part of
1385400	1396160	it? I won't dismiss that idea. He might be part of it. And Jack, Jack Russell, we can't trust him
1397120	1403040	either. Can we Walter look at me and he gets very serious and he puts his hands on your shoulders.
1403040	1413680	We can't trust anyone except for each other. A little bit in the back of my mind tells me
1413680	1425920	I can't trust him either because of, you know, when he tried to sell me, but I say, right,
1425920	1448000	we can only trust each other. I spent so much time thinking about how that bad memory thing
1448000	1455480	would work out that I forgot that I'd had to role play this character more just pass that. Oh yeah.
1455520	1462040	I have to think on my feet as Roger still. Well, Roger Fairfield wakes up with the book of flora
1462040	1474520	and fauna on his chest. I need you to roll a constitution check. I pass a nine on a 70. You
1474520	1481560	feel super fucking weird. Like something is off with your body. Like you are a very particular
1481880	1488200	person. You know how you feel. Something is wrong and your arm hurts. And when you look down,
1489000	1495480	there is a little bit of dried blood, like a little mark of dried blood right in the pit of
1495480	1503080	your elbow. Interesting. Is it daytime? It's morning and you can hear Angela in the kitchen.
1503080	1508680	Do I remember things that happened? But all those memories are swirling around. Like
1509560	1516600	they feel like a dream, but they also felt so real. And with everything that's happened,
1516600	1528360	go ahead and roll sanity. I pass a 57 on a 60. You can put it out of your mind enough,
1528920	1536840	but something inside of you tells you that this is not your second day at calm, comfy campground.
1538680	1545480	Breakfast is ready. And the door pops open to the study. She's like, you slept in here all night.
1546920	1553880	I guess so. I guess I dozed off. Are you feeling okay?
1553880	1557880	Yeah. Bright and early. Ready to go. Time to work on ourselves.
1558520	1564440	Yeah. Yeah. You didn't dream about anything?
1564440	1570120	Do you really want to hear? I guess. Okay. So it was crazy. I was standing in the supermarket
1570120	1576200	and everything on the shelves was made out of styrofoam. It was so terrible. You know
1576200	1578520	how I have that thing with styrofoam? Sure.
1579560	1587000	It just pains me to no end. And I just had to go shopping for some reason. And I kept grabbing
1587000	1593000	stuff and it just made my spine hurt. Zach, I was in character. I was asking Angela.
1593000	1599240	Okay. That's my bad. I fucking hate styrofoam. Yeah, he does.
1599240	1604360	It gives me a physical negative tick. So we went out to brunch one morning
1604360	1608200	and I got a to-go box and I was carving my name into the top of it.
1608200	1611640	You're just saying that. And I thought I was killing you.
1611640	1615160	I didn't know. Maybe Thomas yelled, stop, you're killing him.
1616120	1618920	And I realized, oh shit, that's a real phobia you got.
1619000	1627560	It's so bad. It's part of the inside of me. It's been happening forever. And I did theater
1627560	1635080	in high school and a lot of high school theater sets are made using a lot of styrofoam. And one
1635080	1643720	day I was walking through the wings backstage and this massive, probably 10 by 10 foot sheet
1643720	1650680	of styrofoam was laying on the ground and people were hanging up another equally sized sheet and
1650680	1659000	they dropped it and it floated down. Oh God, just saying it. It floated down and it landed perfectly
1659640	1663720	to where it slid across the top. Oh my God.
1663720	1667560	I literally fell on the ground and just convulsed a little bit.
1667560	1671080	I don't have this phobia at all, but that kind of got me a little bit. That's a weird
1671080	1677560	sensation I can picture. God, I hate it. Fuck. I actually played in a Pathfinder game with our
1677560	1684920	friend Andy and he was running the game and it was a horror Pathfinder game. And he asked Taylor,
1684920	1694920	what would fuck me up? And she told him. And so when the really creepy thing happened in the game,
1694920	1699080	from underneath the table, he just pulled out two pieces of styrofoam and rubbed them together.
1701400	1706120	It hurt me to the point to where he apologized. Yeah, right. Shot through your spine.
1706120	1715560	But it was good. It was good GMing. Anyway, so that's my dream. It was wild. I don't even know
1715560	1721800	what it means. You didn't dream about the lake at all, did you?
1722360	1728760	No, I know it's kind of weird, but no, I kind of think the Blackwater is cool looking.
1729400	1738600	Yeah, I thought that too. I'm going to get in the shower and I'll meet you, I guess,
1738600	1743640	outside. When's the first? What do we do next? Are we meeting with somebody?
1743640	1747800	She grabs a piece of paper and she's like, yeah, we need to be at the main house next,
1747800	1750280	coming up pretty soon. So you have time to shower. It's all good.
1751000	1755480	Okay. I'll meet you outside, I guess. Roll alertness as you go to the shower.
1758920	1764360	I pass another nine on a 40. As you're still in the study before,
1764360	1769560	she turns back and goes back to the kitchen and you notice that the window in this study
1770360	1778200	was definitely closed and locked last night when you went to sleep. And it's definitely cracked
1778200	1786760	open a little bit right now. And on the windowsill, there's a hair tie with some dark brown hair.
1787480	1790200	Not Angela's hair? Not Angela's hair.
1790200	1794760	A hair tie. Okay. So Roger can discern that it's not her hair on site?
1794760	1797240	On site. Okay. I'm going to hold it up. Angela,
1797800	1801320	did you have a friend over or something? What's going on with this?
1801320	1805400	She comes back into the room and is like, what? What? I just found it over by the window.
1806200	1809880	Did somebody come in last night? And her hair is just this
1810680	1818360	flowing mane of curly hair. And she's like, well, I, as you well know, don't live my life
1818360	1823000	with my hair up. I know. I know. I like that.
1823000	1827880	No, that's weird. What? Would someone? I guess it could have been somebody who
1827880	1831400	stayed here from the last time. Oh, yeah. Last week. For sure.
1831400	1835240	I think they do this like every weekend probably. It's weird that the window, I could have sworn.
1836200	1837640	Okay. Are you okay?
1837640	1844360	Yeah. I just, I had a, I just had a rough night. I guess I should've, I shouldn't have fallen asleep
1844360	1848280	in that chair. That's probably what did it. Yeah. Yeah.
1848280	1850920	Okay. And she pops back out. Cool.
1850920	1854360	Yeah. I'm going to go to a shower and meet her up front.
1854360	1860600	She's going to skip to the big house. Oh, okay.
1860600	1862920	Oh no. Not like. I thought she was going to skip.
1863720	1869320	I'm going to get drunk. It doesn't matter. No, she's just going to skip to the Lou.
1869960	1871080	Nice. My darling.
1875720	1877880	She stopped skipping and explodes.
1881880	1887000	Roll scene. You're following her and she's skipping ahead a little bit.
1887960	1894120	And as you guys are approaching the main house, there's a big like wrap around porch on this
1894120	1898600	hexagonal building in the middle that you like walked up the stairs to go through the main door
1898600	1905080	and standing up there is James wearing the same white dress shirt as yesterday.
1905080	1912760	Maybe not the same one keeping the uniform and next to him is a young girl seems to be
1913160	1917160	10, 11, 12, somewhere in there. And she's got pigtails.
1918840	1928520	And as they see Angela and Roger Fairfield walking up, the little girl gets a big smile
1928520	1934040	on her face and runs off the porch. Go ahead and roll human for me.
1937960	1941160	Fail. 67 on a 10.
1942120	1953320	You notice nothing as this little girl comes running up and she is going Anne, Anne, Anne
1953320	1959880	with a big smile on her face and runs up and tries to give Angela Fairfield a hug.
1959880	1962840	How does she react? I don't think I would stop it or anything.
1964200	1968040	Get away from my wife, child. That's my wife.
1968920	1978120	And Angela backs up and is like, Oh, hi, I'm, I'm Angela. It's what's your name? And the
1978120	1983080	girl looks up at her confused. It's like, I'm a Maggie.
1983080	1997960	Fuck you, Zach. Can I, is, uh, is, can I tell this girl and with her hair,
1997960	2002520	can I compare it to the hair tie I saw in my room? Is it probably her hair tie?
2002520	2007480	And I think it's probably hair time. Holy shit. Yeah. There's lots of people named
2007480	2021720	Maggie, I guess. Have you ever had a hit of just the mango nectar that you can get in like the
2021720	2026760	bottle? It's weird that it's called have you seen, I have gotten a hit of the mango nectar.
2029560	2035960	It's just the fruit with water in it. It's the nectar of the mango.
2036680	2039320	You heard what I said, Justin. Gross.
2041960	2044280	The nectar of the man go all over the place.
2047160	2055480	Charles Digby. You wake up staring. Who? Who me? You wake up staring at the walkie
2055480	2058840	talkie on your nightstand. Roll constitution.
2058840	2067240	That is a no, no pass. You feel fucking terrible. Yeah.
2068200	2075480	Terrible to the point to where you feel, Oh God, what? Oh, in your arm, like all over you feel
2075480	2080920	weird, but your arm specifically hurts. And when you look down at it, you see that on the inside
2080920	2087560	of your elbow, there's a little bit of dried blood and there's a slight bruise around it.
2088440	2096680	And you feel as if you may have been drugged. Oh, Oh yeah. Like a, like the syringe entrance
2096680	2100600	and you feel woozy. Oh no. I need you to roll sanity. Okay.
2104840	2110600	Uh, 19 with the pass, whether I have a 10 sand in those memories
2111320	2115880	from last night, they're still swirling around, but you can kind of push them down
2115880	2124040	enough to not dwell on them too hard. But at the same time you have this investigators sensation.
2124040	2126920	Something's awry. Not only is something awry,
2126920	2134840	but this is not your second day at calm comfy campground. Oh, what day is it? You have no idea,
2134840	2144520	but this is not normal. Those memories, they might be real. They might not be, but you don't
2144520	2150520	feel like you just arrived here. Yeah. Is the walkie talkie on? It still is on. Can I like
2150520	2155720	get a little like, hello, hello, like click into it or I can, I don't use a walkie talkie in real
2155720	2162280	life, but you just click the button and you talk into it. Yeah. Hello. Is, is anyone here? Radio
2162280	2169640	silence. Okay. So get dressed, slide that walkie talkie in my back pocket. Roll alertness.
2169640	2179160	Pass. 48 on a 70. When you went to grab the walkie talkie to use it, you realize that it's
2179160	2184440	been moved. Like it's still on your nightstand where it was, but it's not it. Maybe it's like
2184440	2189560	you sat it there when you were in bed, but when you woke up, it was just out of reach,
2189560	2194840	like on the far side and you had it on the closer side. Don't like that.
2194840	2201160	Can I roll like a search to see if anything else is a mess in here from when I went to sleep,
2201160	2204840	anything else I would notice or is that really the only go ahead and roll search. Okay.
2209160	2216040	36 70. Yes. All right. So as you're like getting ready and stuff, you realize that
2217080	2224200	the front door, you locked it last night. You're positive it's unlocked. Fuck. I'm starting to get
2224600	2230040	antsy, but also kind of like keep my cool. I'll pop open the front door and kind of like,
2230040	2235160	as soon as you open the front door, you see the bell boy is standing there with his hand up. Like
2235160	2240760	he was about to knock on the door and I'm just like, Oh, Oh, what, what crazy timing. Did you
2240760	2246840	see me coming? What's going on? Hey, hi, hi, Mr. Digby. Right. Yeah. That that's me. I just
2246840	2251240	wondering if you've seen Jack Russell, the boat man. You met him last night. Have you seen him
2251240	2256760	around this morning? Have you been, I haven't been out of my cottage since I woke up. I just
2256760	2261960	woke up just now. Oh, okay. Sorry. Oh, late riser there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well,
2261960	2267800	uh, no big deal. Not an issue, but, uh, you know, he's not in his apartment, so, uh,
2268440	2273160	maybe just holler. Let us know when you come up. You'll be at the main house soon for another
2273160	2278280	meeting. So yeah. Yeah. If I see anything, I'll, I'll let you guys know. Okay. Thanks. I'll be on
2278360	2285480	my way. Slam the door. Like what the fuck is happening when you turn around? You hear,
2285480	2292280	we'll use that search roll and roll it over. You hear heavy breathing from underneath your feet.
2292280	2299160	Oh God. Is it wood floor? Yeah. I like kind of skip back almost like I'm like trying to
2299160	2303560	Dodge something that isn't there, but I'm like jump in the air and jump back. Is it like following me
2303560	2308920	or is it still where, where the sound was emanating from? That's where it was. Hello.
2308920	2314040	It is someone down there and I kind of like knock on the wood. Roll search again.
2316840	2321000	Ooh, a nine on a 70. Yeah. You can definitely hear that someone's down there, but they're not
2321000	2325320	responding. You can roll persuade if you want to try to like persuade them to talk to you.
2325320	2329960	Yeah. I'm going to be like, Hey, don't be afraid. I'm here. Like, cause I know something fucked
2329960	2333400	up is happening. So I might be worried that something fucked up is happening to this person.
2337640	2346040	A crit success. 44 on a 50. Can I trust you? Jack? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as much as you can
2346040	2353080	trust anyone. I'll take it. And one of the floorboards pops up and then another one pops
2353080	2361560	up and he climbs up out of the floor beneath you. Hey, um, and he looks like absolute shit.
2361560	2367960	He's like sweating profusely and his face is pale white. Yeah. Digby. Right. Charles. Yeah.
2367960	2372360	That's that's me. You're a, what did they tell me? You were, you're some kind of investigator,
2372360	2378440	right? Yeah. Yeah. I trust you. You know what the fuck is going on? I have no idea. I have this.
2378440	2383800	I take out the walkie talk. I have this. Is that yours? What, what is some, some little
2384440	2391320	girl or something? Talk to me on here at one point last night. And then I fell asleep and I had all
2391320	2396920	these fucked up dreams. You were there. What were we doing? We were on the canoes on the water,
2396920	2402840	escaping something. I don't, I don't understand something fucked up and creepy. And then out of
2402840	2409640	nowhere, we snapped into this white led room with tapes everywhere. Oh, you've been to the tape
2409640	2417320	room. Yeah. I know your name was on all these tapes. There's hundreds of your name. That
2417320	2424120	explains a lot. My memory is shot right now. It's all split and twine with each other. It's all
2424120	2431400	coming up on its own ends and flipping around inside my brain. And then there's this and I
2431400	2436760	show him my arm with like the bruise. What looks like maybe I got my blood taken or something
2436760	2445080	drugged. He looks super happy and he holds up his arm. Oh mate. He reaches back down into the floor
2445080	2450680	and pulls out a duffel bag and rummages around through there and grabs a syringe out. And he's
2450680	2455720	like, I didn't do that to you, mate. I know I didn't, but I did do it to me. What is this?
2456280	2461160	It's an inoculation. And he keeps his voice down and then he immediately realizes
2461720	2466280	and he starts looking around at the corners of the room. Can I look too,
2466280	2468680	to see if I see like a camera placement? Yeah, roll search.
2472280	2477320	Nope. Fail. He gets really close to you and he's like, stop looking. They might be watching.
2477320	2482120	Okay. I kind of stare at my feet a little bit. Let's get, ah, fuck. We gotta,
2483080	2489480	we gotta get out of here. But I, oh shit, shit, shit. Do you mind if I hide out here?
2489480	2494120	If you feel safer here, stay here. Are you going to fucking tell me? Are you a snitch?
2494120	2498440	No, no, no, no, no. Something, something bad is happening to all of us here.
2498440	2502920	I couldn't agree more. I don't know what it is, but we, we need to find out.
2503720	2507720	Scream. The room explodes.
2515880	2522760	You're all sitting in the meeting room that you had orientation in and it is Roger Fairfield,
2522760	2527560	Angela Fairfield, Charles Digby, Mark Bradley Cooper, and,
2528280	2537960	and Walter and Alan Grimes are all sitting there and the door opens and James comes in and he's
2537960	2543560	like, Hey, um, real quick. Do you mind if I borrow you for just a moment, Angela, if you wouldn't
2543560	2548360	mind coming on out here, I need to have a word. Is everything all right? Don't worry. It'll be
2548360	2553880	fine. Uh, yeah, no, it's, uh, it's not a big deal. We just need to, Hey Angela, are you really his
2553960	2563400	wife? Real human fail. He seems fine. And the explanation that he gives is valid.
2565640	2572040	All right, have fun. Do they remember the reveal about Martin? Yep. He's going to act like they
2572040	2578920	don't. I, yeah, I kind of want to like look and kind of be like, do you guys sleep okay?
2579640	2587560	Roger perks up a little. I didn't really. Do you think maybe we all had a shared dream of some
2587560	2594840	kind last night? I that's entirely possible. Walter, tell them, was it the cassette cases?
2595720	2604760	Was it the canoes as well? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I also had those dreams. Do you guys have,
2604760	2615000	and he like reaches out his arms. So does Roger injected. Would your wife with you? I asked if
2615000	2620120	she had any weird dreams and she did, but they weren't ours. Did you look at her arm?
2622120	2629320	You dumb son of a bitch. I didn't, I didn't need to look at her arm because
2629320	2637960	I saw yesterday. What do you mean? What do you mean? She already, she already had a mark on her
2637960	2643240	arm yesterday. I hadn't seen it before. I asked her about it. She told me it was, she and I,
2643240	2647000	we travel overseas often. We have to get vaccinations. She told me it was a reaction
2647000	2652200	to a vaccination, but I didn't have that reaction. Did she have it? Are you saying before you got to
2652200	2657880	the campground? I mean, I noticed it when we got here. Yeah. That's weird. Do you guys all remember
2657880	2664360	that I'm a billionaire? We knew, we knew that you were a villain. We did not know that you
2664360	2672360	were a billionaire. Now maybe you'll treat me with the proper respect. Oh shit. You can tell
2672360	2678520	by the look on Alan's face that he won't. I mean, the thought of don't forget that we,
2678520	2682760	a man like Alan thinking anything about me, that doesn't move Martin.
2682760	2689720	Even if you think that his son is a mechanical boy. Oh, I don't care what he thinks. I'm going
2689720	2699880	to steal his son and deconstruct him at my factory. Walter, Walter says, don't forget
2699880	2705560	that we can check your movements on our television. Yeah. Well, good luck with that. Is it all of us?
2705560	2710200	Is it every, every cabin? I didn't see anything on my TV. I checked this morning. I also didn't
2710200	2719320	find any cameras. I look at Alan and I, um, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, I've been practicing
2719960	2725480	martial arts my entire adult life. We saw you do it in your bedroom the other night. I know
2725480	2731480	I'm basically the wind. So if I want to be unseen, you're not going to see me understand.
2732120	2739080	Did any of you, well, I was going to ask if you found cameras in your cabins, but I did. I think
2739080	2747320	we know the answer. I just told you that I looked for cameras and didn't find one. I did not look
2747320	2753800	for cameras. So there could be Roger. We found cameras in our cabin. Who's got your channel?
2753800	2765400	Who's got our channel? Which one of you has our channel? Alan, I have something to tell you.
2766040	2771880	You're not actually Alan. I brought you here with me. You're a secret government project
2771880	2776040	from the late seventies. You're a clone of Donald duck and Richard Nixon.
2778920	2780680	Father is that, is that,
2783960	2789720	is that mostly I'll keep you around for my own amusement. Is that true? That would explain why
2789720	2795240	we don't remember arriving here. I'm just fucking with them. Do you guys remember arriving?
2796360	2803320	No, no, I just, I know I lost a little sanity when I thought about it in a manner of speaking.
2803320	2807080	I'm kind of like freaking out a little bit now, realizing I don't actually remember
2809640	2816120	saying for you, Roger Fairfield, who didn't realize that he didn't know how we got here.
2816680	2820520	Of course I know how we got here. We came up the
2820520	2832600	fail. Oh, you got a 97. I got a 94 dice. The two of you know innately inside of you that
2832600	2840760	you have absolutely no memory of being on your way here or even a boat ride to get to this island.
2840760	2847160	You have no fucking clue how you got here. Do we lose sanity? Good question.
2847880	2853320	Shut the fuck up, man. Dude, don't fucking tell him who's dead.
2853320	2858520	Listen guys, this might not be great news necessarily from your perspectives, but I think,
2858520	2863000	I think something to keep in mind, we saw the names of a lot of famous people on those tapes,
2863560	2868440	people who've gone out into the world and done things presumably after they've been here.
2868440	2873720	So, you know, just try to keep your head on straight and hopefully we'll get out of this.
2873720	2876920	Why did you guys come here? To work on my shit.
2876920	2878440	Yeah. It was that.
2878440	2882600	It was Angela's idea. She thought it would be good for our marriage.
2882600	2887480	Do you remember when she posed the idea to you to come here?
2888280	2893480	Yeah. I mean, we, we had a fight. She said that this would help us.
2893480	2899880	That memory begins swirling around and it feels just as distant and confusing
2900440	2904920	as being in the canoes or being in the room with all the shelves.
2904920	2911880	Wow. You, huh, seem to start becoming pale. What is happening?
2920920	2923000	It looks like you have like an eyelash in your eye.
2924920	2926440	Quick, put a spoon in his mouth.
2926440	2930360	You're not supposed to do that anymore.
2931400	2932440	I thought it was a wallet.
2932440	2933240	I put a wallet.
2935000	2937880	Well, most people have a wallet. Not many people have spoons.
2939480	2941000	Not in general, just on them traditionally.
2941000	2946600	Bradley Cooper's wallet wouldn't fit inside of someone's because you're a villionaire.
2947320	2948040	Oh my God.
2948920	2950600	Billionaire. Say it.
2951720	2952680	Billionaire.
2952680	2953480	That's right.
2953480	2954040	Yeah.
2954040	2956200	I show you my slim wallet. All cards.
2957960	2966040	I look over at Roger. Do you think your wife has left you here to escape or should we try to
2966040	2967000	escape?
2967000	2972440	That's, that's a good point. Uh, Oh God, James, James is probably in on whatever this is that's
2972440	2978520	happening to us. And she's alone with him right now. Roger's going to stand up and start walking
2978520	2979000	to the door.
2979000	2980120	Roger, wait, wait.
2980120	2981000	Hold on. We need to think.
2981000	2981400	Your wife.
2982040	2982680	Those tapes.
2983720	2984840	She wasn't with us.
2984840	2987800	They didn't, they didn't get, get, they didn't get to her.
2987800	2991400	Do you remember your life with Angela before coming here?
2991400	2992840	Sure. Of course.
2992840	2993720	Roll sanity.
2996520	2998200	Quit asking Jovia remembers things.
3001000	3004600	We just sit in this room for the next 20 minutes, getting Joe down to zero.
3004600	3005160	I pass.
3008200	3009800	And do you love her and is she?
3010760	3012920	And what is actually, how'd you guys meet?
3012920	3013880	What's your middle name?
3013880	3016440	Okay. So you're a human. Like you are dead.
3016440	3020200	Yeah. I passed my sanity rule. So yeah. Uh, yeah, of course I remember her.
3020200	3026680	Right. When Roger gets up, I look at Alan wanting to follow after Roger, but I,
3026680	3028360	what kind of a look do I get from Alan?
3028360	3034600	Uh, wide-eyed and confused. He is still wondering if he is a Silicon Valley project created
3034600	3035480	by Bradley Cooper.
3037000	3037800	You'll never know.
3038360	3045000	I go over to, um, Alan, I reach under his chin and press up.
3045000	3046120	Oh, that's my tongue.
3046120	3047480	I think that you're okay.
3047480	3051320	I go over to the robot boy and I do the same thing.
3051320	3058200	My like Husky blue eye, blue gray eyes, black.
3060120	3061720	And I am still.
3061720	3064280	Luke, take off your headphones and plug up those ears.
3065240	3067240	I found the factory reset on this freak.
3068360	3070040	I think Rogers freaked out. What the fuck?
3071080	3073720	Don't you remember from the dream? He's a mechanical boy.
3073720	3076440	That was an idea you floated out of fucking insanity.
3076440	3079800	That's not a real thing that could happen that the boy copped to.
3079800	3084120	Hey guys, he just closes his eyes. They don't go black.
3086520	3089480	Oh, so, okay. Rewind.
3090360	3093960	Sorry. Oh, I was mistaken.
3093960	3097320	Look, he's just closing really hard. He is a little freak.
3097880	3100440	Maybe this kid's not as smart as I thought. He might not be.
3100440	3102280	I knew he wasn't a mechanical boy.
3103960	3105480	Trust me. We're working on that though.
3106680	3109160	Maybe, maybe, maybe touch his chin again.
3109160	3110600	Yeah. Turn him, turn back on.
3110600	3111720	Do it in person.
3111720	3113160	Somebody else can do that if they want it.
3113160	3113720	It's quiet.
3113720	3116520	Oh, Alan, Alan will do it. Yeah. Alan immediately.
3116520	3118760	Like after you, as you guys are having this conversation, he's like, well,
3118760	3122120	don't talk about my son. And he clicks underneath your chin.
3123160	3126040	Alan pulls his finger away from underneath your chin.
3126040	3127480	You back with us, bud?
3127480	3130600	I instinctively punch Martin.
3130600	3133480	Okay. That's going to be contested because he's some martial arts expert.
3134440	3136440	All right. Unarmed combat.
3141000	3142440	34 on a 40.
3142440	3143800	75 on a 70.
3145560	3151480	He's not expecting it from this like, from this deactivated robot boy.
3151480	3153240	So as soon as I'm back.
3153240	3153960	Roll a D4.
3153960	3158520	Yeah, that's going to be easy.
3158520	3159560	That's a four.
3159560	3160920	No, I meant to give you the other dice.
3164920	3166200	You punch him in the throat.
3171000	3172040	As soon as I do it,
3177080	3181560	as soon as I do it, I, I do it and I withdraw my hand.
3181560	3186600	And then immediately I put my hand on his shoulder and I am not supposed to do that.
3186600	3187960	I am not supposed to do that.
3187960	3190280	Yeah. You're violating your prime directive kid.
3190840	3203160	I am so sorry. And I get your fucking hand off me.
3211560	3241160	Hey.
3242280	3245160	This is real life.
3248360	3258200	No matter how high you look on me, I think that you could fall.
3260600	3265240	I knew I'd make you believe.
3296200	3299880	I'd leave you all without me.
3304840	3309320	Well, oh well, how you doin'?
3309320	3313080	Now I think you could follow me.
3314440	3318680	Cornered, room in at least right.
3318680	3328680	Cornered, room in at least right.
3348680	3358680	Cornered, room in at least right.
3378680	3388680	Cornered, room in at least right.
