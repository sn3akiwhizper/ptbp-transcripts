0	1920	Small beans.
1920	3720	Big beans.
3720	5760	Spicy beans.
5760	7400	Creamy beans.
7400	11440	Those are just a few of the kinds of beans that I love.
11440	15760	But you know which beans I love the most, do ya?
15760	16840	It's y'all.
16840	19960	It's your bean connoisseur, Wolf the Dog,
19960	24960	cooking up a bean stew with you, live from 694.2 PTBP.
25960	30680	Take your fart medicine, it's about to get gassy.
30680	34280	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dimitri the Bear,
34280	37720	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.
37720	41800	A very simple, effective, and cherished action.
41800	46260	They write, dearest Elaine, this one goes out to you.
46260	49460	You've been my friend since longer than the time
49460	53800	when gas is swirled and supernovae shined.
53800	57240	You shared with me your feelings, thoughts, and toys,
57240	60880	and readily endured with me the joys
60880	64160	of Wolf the Dog and our contention boys.
64160	67480	Wow, Dimitri the Bear, it's nice to finally meet
67480	70500	another insert name, the animal.
70500	73480	We may be few, but we are powerful.
73480	74320	Ow!
75260	78640	Also, good poem or whatever.
78640	82940	But as a rancid poet, I am simply more clever.
82940	86380	Whenever you write to me again, you better think twice,
86380	88600	because when you'll step into Wolf,
88600	91300	buddy, you're on thin ice.
91300	95360	But I'll allow you just this once to shift the blame,
95360	97480	for I will not embarrass you,
97480	101160	not in front of your dearest Elaine.
101160	103180	This one here is another recap,
103180	106420	a map of the chaps madcap mishaps.
106420	111180	Snap to or I'll slap you, no nap, no cap.
111220	114500	Strap in and lap it up before we wrap it up.
114500	116700	It's kudzu with no backbone.
146700	151700	After the murder of both his brother, Ferguson Beans,
152260	155340	and his brother's partner's mother, Joan Robin,
155340	159160	Keith Vigna, back at Hotel Motel, dreamt
159160	161260	he stood at a bar, empty,
161260	163860	except for himself and the bartender.
163860	167220	The bar was run down, smelled of piss and vomit,
167220	171420	and looked to have been vacated quickly by other customers.
171420	173840	The man behind the bar was dressed in clothing
173840	178840	from the late 1800s, and spoke fearfully to Keith,
179020	183760	asking if he wanted answers or maybe cocaine.
183760	186040	Keith asked for the former,
186040	188480	as he'd had enough of the latter.
188480	190720	The saloon-style door swung open,
190720	194560	allowing the entrance of a woman Keith recognized.
194560	197240	In her hands was a massive trunk,
197240	200440	which she heaved onto the bar and opened.
200440	203400	Inside was the camera red light lit,
203400	205760	the gun also red light lit,
205760	209160	and the radio green light lit.
209160	211120	Seeing this, Keith told the woman
211120	214080	the camera wouldn't be ready until one,
214080	217200	and knowing the other two take a few days,
217200	221720	asked what he should do if they come for him.
221720	226360	As is the way with dreams, Mary was suddenly gone,
226360	230320	and the barkeep, Lloyd, pulled a corkscrew from his pocket
230320	233960	and held it on the bar in front of Keith, pointy side up.
233960	236380	Lloyd then slammed his head into the corkscrew
236380	238720	and held eye contact with Keith,
238720	242520	as little bits of cocaine fell out of the hole in his head.
242520	245320	Keith looked down and found the cocaine had fallen
245320	248520	in the pattern of a stick figure family.
248520	252520	He pulled out a $100 bill sporting the visage
252520	255680	of Abraham Lincoln, and snorted up
255680	258200	this little powder family.
259040	262240	As he did, Lloyd phased through the back of the bar
262240	263720	and out of sight.
263720	266560	Keith came to in his police cruiser,
266560	269040	pulling into the department parking lot.
269040	270960	He had been lost in the dream,
270960	274080	and also running over the gruesome details
274080	279080	of the murder-suicide he had just staged earlier
279400	283360	in the early morning between Joan, Robin,
283360	285780	and Ferguson Beans.
285780	288500	John Lee Pettymore IV was also dreaming,
288500	292220	dreaming he was rolling across the ground with ease,
292220	295860	ignoring a man in a fancy suit who mopped the floor
295860	299480	and mouth trumpeted along with Louis Armstrong.
299480	303300	Outside, the sky appeared dark and stormy.
303300	305920	John seemed to be inside a closed store,
305920	309060	but the door opened anyway, triggering the bell above.
309060	311500	John looked up to the figure in the doorway,
311500	315140	unable to identify them through the black cloak they wore,
315140	320140	and this figure dropped a massive book on the ground
320420	323860	before stumbling back into the night.
323860	327780	John's vision began to distort, and he became disoriented.
327780	331100	As it cleared, he found that he was a baby again,
331100	334260	sitting on the floor in the back of clinkers.
334260	338020	A young Gary Daley walked into the daycare at clinkers
338020	341900	and pulled a large leather tome from his pack.
341900	343420	He looked over his shoulder,
343460	345820	and turning his attention back to the book,
345820	350180	winced and ripped a page from the spine.
350180	354660	He paused, listened, and then stowed the book away
354660	358340	before approaching John with the stray page.
358340	361580	Daley pulled a knife from his bag and began to chant,
361580	365260	reading from the paper, the script on which seemed to spark
365260	367180	as he spoke the words.
367180	370180	He continued to chant as he drew blood from his thumb
370180	373000	and let it drip onto baby John.
373440	375840	The sparks began to engulf the paper,
375840	378640	and the flames danced around John's head
378640	380400	before disappearing.
380400	383360	Daley spoke to himself as he wiped the blood
383360	385280	from John's head.
385280	389440	"'Grandpa, you old kook, you old wizard,' he sighed.
390460	392100	"'I hope this does him good.
392100	394880	"'Well, two down, one to go.'"
394880	397460	Hey, hey, John, what are you thinking about?
397460	400160	John also came to as he pulled into
400160	403160	the contentioned police department parking lot,
403160	406680	riding shotgun in Drew's cherry-bread Mini Cooper.
406680	410640	Drew, terrified, drove while Rosemary sat in the back
410640	413520	with both the men's guns at the ready.
413520	415920	Clark dreamt he was running,
415920	418920	running because it was imperative that he run,
418920	422080	running because he was close,
422080	425880	because this was a chance to stop them.
425880	428360	He narrowly dodged oncoming traffic
428360	431400	upon realizing suddenly that he was on the highway.
431400	433200	He made it to the bridge, jumped,
433200	435720	and recognized he wouldn't make the water.
435720	437720	He braced for impact.
437720	440900	Clark's shinbone pushed through his kneecap,
440900	442120	but he continued to run,
442120	445400	trailing a stream of blood behind him.
445400	448600	Ahead, Clark saw his old nemesis
448600	453120	and remembered why the animals took refuge in the water.
453120	454960	He jumped in the creek himself,
454960	457080	ignoring the pain in his knee
457080	462080	and this black ooze followed along the shore.
462520	464840	From the river, Clark saw himself
464840	466840	in the window of his own house
466840	470280	and mustered up the strength to climb out from the river.
470280	472300	He called to himself from the backyard.
472300	475840	He told himself to run, to get the fuck out of there.
475840	478840	He told himself he could get it right this time.
478840	481560	Clark jolted awake in the back of the cab.
481560	484060	He noted a tightness in his chest
484100	488780	as the car turned into the parking lot of the contention PD.
488780	493400	It was December 5th, a foggy blustery day in contention.
493400	496420	An old Husky made its way down the road
496420	498940	and paused before fleeing
498940	502420	upon hearing the three cars approach.
502420	505820	The officers had a moment to judge each other's situations.
505820	508300	John turned and finally asked Rosemary's name,
508300	511460	eventually explaining that if she wants the gun,
511460	513940	Drew and John will need theirs back.
514700	516100	Rosemary agreed, but was quick to explain
516100	517940	that if she happened to go missing,
517940	521420	Marvin Glass would find and torture anyone
521420	522820	who might be connected.
522820	525220	The officers noted that a stranger's car
525220	529660	was parked in the lot, a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
529660	532220	Clark admitted to the taxi driver he had no money,
532220	536500	but the cabbie explained the ride had been paid for already.
536500	539900	Upon stepping outside, the other two cops wondered
539900	543060	why Clark was dressed in pajamas.
543060	546900	Clark lied saying he'd been sleepwalking.
546900	549460	John smoothed things over between Rosemary
549460	551540	and his nervous partners while insisting
551540	554860	they would all soon be traveling to the city
554860	558260	to deliver the gun to Marvin Glass.
558260	562620	John reminded his partners of Jermaine and Alfred Glass.
562620	565860	Marvin's sons were trying to find the gun.
565860	569000	Given the officer's knowledge of the gun and the sons,
569000	571860	John suggested they might be in a good place
571860	575260	to do business with Marvin, essentially allying
575260	578420	the contention PD with the Glass crime family.
578420	580820	John thought that working together,
580820	584020	they might be able to use the gun to bring people back
584020	586160	from wherever they disappeared to.
586160	587780	They planned to leave for the city
587780	590500	as soon as the gun was in hand.
590500	593340	The officer circled back to a conversation about the husky,
593340	597260	the first animal they'd seen out of the water in days.
597260	600740	They decided to head into the station rather than follow it
600740	604540	when they remembered the strange sports car in their lot.
604540	607740	Keith looked into the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse
607740	611320	and saw a massive container of creatine powder,
611320	615780	empty Red Bull cans, and a pair of Oakleys.
615780	618960	John, wielding two guns, kicked in the door to the station
618960	620440	and shouted the words,
620440	624340	"'Contention PD, freeze, douchebag.'"
624340	627380	A young man in a blue suit and red striped tie
627420	629860	had been pacing the floor of the department
629860	632180	and froze Red Bull in hand.
632180	634980	The man obediently dropped the beverage on the carpet
634980	638120	and invited the officers to take the FBI badge
638120	639520	from his jacket.
639520	642940	This was Agent Trent Chad.
642940	644540	As soon as Clark had the badge,
644540	646460	he tranquilized the agent with a dart
646460	647700	from the circle of knowledge
647700	651180	and Chad became immediately suggestible.
651180	654260	Clark's partners were suspicious of the dart gun,
654260	658000	but Clark explained that his previous night's detour
658000	660900	had informed him the FBI would arrive.
660900	664680	He couldn't give specifics, but this had all been expected.
664680	666460	As the officers decided what to do
666460	667940	with the tranquilized agent,
667940	670860	Drew arrived and saw that Chad had been digging
670860	672700	through the department's files.
672700	676140	When Agent Trent Chad suggested the three present officers
676140	678300	were some of the worst in history,
678300	682220	the crew asked if he had any experience in PR.
682220	684420	Chad had plenty of experience, it turned out,
684420	687580	so the officers devised an impromptu press conference
687580	689500	to calm the population.
689500	691460	They settled on a filmed statement
691460	693840	that confirmed everything was okay,
693840	696260	that the contention PD should be given room
696260	697800	to do what they need to do,
697800	699880	and that everything done so far
699880	702620	had been in the interest of the people.
702620	705300	Having filmed the statement, they told Agent Chad
705300	709140	to convey the same sentiments to his superiors.
709140	711160	As Clark moved to the back of the station
711160	713200	to retrieve his spare clothes,
713200	716080	he noticed the cells were empty.
716080	717800	Though the cell doors were locked,
717800	722160	Dr. Marie Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs had vanished.
722160	726840	Keith suggested they review the security footage.
726840	730160	This footage revealed the cat running wildly
730160	733000	about the station, jumping from spot to spot to spot.
733000	736680	The Jacobs' bodies and their cells were picked up
736680	740420	into the air and slammed into the ground repeatedly
740420	745260	by some unseen force before they disappeared.
745260	748340	The officers noticed the cat had been looking up
748340	749740	when it became scared.
749740	751500	Given the consistent patterns,
751500	755580	they concluded this was all likely the work of the goo.
755580	758020	The officers considered what they knew,
758020	760540	that animals could see or sense the goo,
760540	764180	and that they had the power to become animals themselves
764180	765580	if they needed to.
765580	767660	While discussing the possibilities presented
767660	770100	by the strange evidence they'd collected,
770100	773940	Keith said the camera might be active again at 1 p.m.,
773940	776540	a suspiciously specific thought.
776540	779460	They walked into the evidence locker together
779460	781280	and found the helmet red light lit,
781280	784040	the camera red light lit, the gun red light lit,
784040	788020	and the radio green light lit.
788020	790380	Doug the cat appeared in the locker room
790380	793580	and indicated he had something to say to Keith.
793580	797040	Clark bolted from the room as Doug jumped up onto the shelf
797040	800020	and began to rub along the green lit radio,
800900	801900	fearing a body switch.
801900	805340	Outside, Agent Chad mopped up Red Bull
805340	809260	and Rosemary tapped an impatient foot.
809260	811840	John Lee Pettymore pulled Doug away from the radio
811840	814340	and chided him for the attempt to switch bodies.
814340	815700	The cat became frantic,
815700	818860	but John hugged him tightly to his chest
818860	820940	and began to consider the possibility
820940	824460	of switching the man inside the cat back out
824460	826000	for information.
826000	828420	When Doug agreed to switch with the FBI agent,
828420	831940	the officers suggested Agent Chad sleep
831940	835940	and dragged his unconscious body into the evidence room.
835940	837620	With everything set up for the switch,
837620	839600	the officers listened from outside
839600	842260	as the radio transitioned from music
842260	846500	to a jumble of audio culminating in a high-pitched tone
846500	849220	that screeched in their ears.
849220	853260	A light flashed inside and there was silence.
853260	857060	Soon, they heard Chad's voice from inside.
857060	859020	It was Doug, resituating himself
859020	860860	in the body of the fit agent.
860860	863100	Agent Chad and the cat's body attempted
863100	865540	to make a panicked escape as they opened the door,
865540	867580	but they captured him with Doug's help.
867580	870140	The officers asked Drew to go buy a cat kennel,
870140	872100	prompting a strange look.
872100	874860	Rosemary began to insist on the gun
874860	877660	and the officers became condescending.
877660	880940	She unlocked the police station door and left.
880940	882460	The officers ran after Rosemary
882460	885300	and found her banging on the trunk of Drew's car
885300	887020	as he attempted to back out.
887860	888820	She quashed the potential conflict,
888820	892460	saying she only wanted the briefcase in the back.
892460	895620	With that in hand, she released Drew to his errand.
895620	897220	Despite the tense situation,
897220	899620	Rosemary calmly explained that the case
899620	902260	contained five million dollars.
902260	905180	Content, Rosemary returned to the police station.
905180	907160	John and Clark followed.
907160	910220	Inside, Doug stood marveling at his new body.
910220	912620	He had a very clear memory of what had happened
912620	914060	prior to the body switch,
914100	917380	but before he could explain, he began to panic.
917380	919100	He could see the ooze,
919100	921940	though it was invisible to everyone else.
921940	923220	Clark rushed to the sink
923220	925700	and began to toss water about the station.
925700	928540	John pulled a pipe from the break room sink,
928540	931280	allowing water to flood onto the floor.
931280	933380	Rosemary, unsure of what was happening,
933380	937540	perched calmly on Drew's desk with the briefcase.
937540	939700	They attempted to get more detail from Doug,
939700	940700	but he was terrified.
940700	942540	The water wasn't stopping the ooze.
942580	944140	Doug made a run for the door.
944140	946540	Keith and Clark followed him out to the parking lot,
946540	949140	and there, they found him standing frozen.
949140	951300	Doug's mental state continued to devolve
951300	952960	as they led him to Keith's car,
952960	956520	and their attempts to calm or slap sense into him failed.
956520	958480	Clark confirmed that Doug and Chad's body
958480	961000	was still under the influence of the tranquilizer.
961000	963580	He was able to explain that in the days leading up
963580	966380	to his becoming a cat, he had been sick.
966380	968840	His wife, Marie, had brought the radio in,
968840	971620	and a dream-like blur followed.
971620	973260	He began to disassociate,
973260	976180	claiming they were all part of a dream.
976180	978500	He tried to explain they were not dreaming,
978500	981100	but Clark leaned into the idea.
981100	982620	What was the worst that could happen to Doug
982620	984500	if he helped in the dream?
984500	988000	Inside, John found a vacuum and attempted blindly
988000	989580	to capture the ooze.
989580	992700	In leaping about, he noticed Agent Chad's briefcase
992700	994260	on one of the desks.
994260	996620	Assuming the coast was clear, he opened it,
996620	999660	found several signs, a list, a map,
999660	1003740	and a small cell phone jammer that was turned on.
1003740	1005820	Keith and Clark brought Doug back inside
1005820	1007880	to see if he still saw the goo.
1007880	1010840	He didn't, and he became distracted by his reflection
1010840	1012280	in the break room mirror.
1012280	1015000	Doug was unsure whether lingering animal instincts
1015000	1016820	had allowed him to see the goo,
1016820	1018380	or if it had been an illusion.
1019260	1021560	He was pretty certain he was still in a dream.
1021560	1023920	John drew the group's attention to the signs
1023920	1026000	in Agent Chad's briefcase.
1026000	1027040	They read,
1027040	1031800	Attention, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land,
1031800	1035680	once the town Perdition, just west of contention,
1035680	1037280	is heading this way.
1037280	1039640	Please evacuate immediately.
1039640	1041560	Don't forget your pets.
1041560	1044320	The list contained all the locations Agent Chad
1044320	1045980	had planned to place the signs,
1045980	1048900	and the map detailed all the missing persons
1048900	1050760	and the dates they disappeared.
1050760	1052600	All the disappearances occurred
1052600	1055720	on December 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.
1056600	1060480	Marked an explosion in cases across town.
1060480	1063080	Rosemary stood suddenly and gave the officers
1063080	1065560	five minutes to turn over the gun.
1065560	1067020	They used their time to decide
1067020	1070560	between visiting Perdition or the city.
1070560	1072480	The officers called Drew and asked him
1072480	1074820	to put Chad's signs up in town,
1074820	1079060	but Drew claimed he had seen literally no one on his errand.
1079060	1081800	No customers in the store, no employees,
1081800	1084560	no cars on the road, nothing.
1084560	1087440	But then a car arrived at the station
1087440	1089080	driven by an older woman.
1089080	1094080	It was Jan Manstein, the mother of an Ari Manstein,
1094400	1097860	whose name was not immediately familiar.
1097860	1100600	Jan had arrived to gather Ari's possessions
1100600	1101840	from the station.
1101840	1103740	Her daughter had been killed
1103740	1106720	in the hospital fire in the city.
1106720	1109240	The officers recognized that Ari's position
1109240	1113920	matched that of Ray, or was it Tim, or Lauren,
1114760	1117960	Florence, who they had sent to the hospital.
1117960	1120300	As soon as they understood the name switch,
1120300	1122800	the officers were flooded with memories
1122800	1125660	of this fourth contentioned police officer,
1125660	1129800	all of whom they last remembered sending to the hospital
1129800	1132720	on an ambulance with Rosemary.
1132720	1136700	Clark tried to console Jan as she cleaned out Ari's desk.
1136700	1139720	She invited them all to her funeral the following day
1139720	1141280	at the city cemetery,
1141320	1144120	where Ari was to be buried with her family.
1144120	1147760	In the back room, Rosemary eyed the evidence locker
1147760	1151260	as John interrogated her about the hospital fire.
1151260	1153740	Rosemary eventually admitted to starting the fire
1153740	1155280	that killed their colleague.
1155280	1159200	John insisted that she play it cool while Jan was around.
1159200	1162280	As Jan finished picking up Ari's things,
1162280	1165440	she struggled to decide whether or not to tell her husband,
1165440	1167940	Ari's father, Stan Manstein,
1167940	1171740	who had been in the city asylum for 28 years.
1171740	1173100	When John offered to tell him,
1173100	1175920	she agreed enthusiastically.
1175920	1177340	Just as Jan was leaving,
1177340	1179700	they asked if she'd seen anybody about town
1179700	1183260	as she came through, and she told them she hadn't.
1183260	1184600	With Jan out of the station,
1184600	1187880	the officers finally let themselves feel shaken
1187880	1191980	by the conflicting personas of this mysterious colleague.
1191980	1193660	The memories seemed to combine
1193660	1196060	into one almost anonymous individual,
1196060	1200260	their only connection being the family name, Manstein.
1200260	1202140	John pulled Rosemary aside again
1202140	1203860	before they piled into the car.
1203860	1207820	Out of view, he pushed his pistol to Rosemary's head
1207820	1209440	and threatened to kill her
1209440	1211940	if she didn't return Drew's money.
1211940	1215100	Rosemary surrendered the money and slowly turned
1215100	1219840	so that the gun's barrel was centered between her eyes.
1219840	1224840	It's hilarious that you think you can kill me.
1230520	1234960	She chuckled before walking back out into the station.
1234960	1237760	John collected himself and stashed the briefcase
1237760	1239560	in the evidence locker.
1239560	1242360	An email from Wolf the dog revealed
1242360	1244600	their PSA was about to air.
1244600	1245720	The message was followed
1245720	1249300	by news of the Beans Robin murder suicide.
1249300	1252260	John and Clark looked up at Keith DeGage's reaction.
1252260	1253820	Keith stared at the ground
1253820	1256060	and admitted that Ferguson was his brother
1256060	1258300	but said he hadn't seen him in a while.
1258300	1260420	Keith agreed it'd be worthwhile to check in
1260420	1262900	with the city PD about the crime scene,
1262900	1265300	the crime scene he had orchestrated.
1266340	1268340	As the officers headed toward the highway
1268340	1269900	on their way to the city,
1269900	1273000	they confirmed the utter abandonment of contention.
1273000	1274820	Gone were the runners, the beggars,
1274820	1276820	the teenagers and their pot smoking.
1276820	1278900	Gone too were the protests.
1279380	1280780	The town would have been silent
1280780	1283740	if not for the distant sound of other cars
1283740	1287000	and the cries of abandoned animals from the creek.
1287000	1288420	Given that two of the cruisers
1288420	1290140	had been involved in accidents,
1290140	1292460	the officers told Rosemary to lead the way
1292460	1296180	and they piled into a single cruiser with Doug Chad.
1296180	1299140	The crew stopped by Clark's spotless garage
1299140	1302380	to ransack the US military branded crates
1302380	1305000	they had stolen from John Peter's storage units
1305000	1307340	for pistols, shotguns, rifles,
1307340	1309940	a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon,
1309940	1312180	an EMP rifle, a grappling gun,
1312180	1314420	a small gun that shot tracers,
1314420	1316480	lots of grenades, a sniper rifle
1316480	1319420	and a very tiny but powerful gun.
1319420	1322500	Each of the officers also donned body armor
1322500	1325340	and packed a small bag of cocaine.
1325340	1327640	They remembered at the very last moment
1327640	1330340	to bring the strange gun and camera
1330340	1332980	with the odd glass tubes.
1332980	1334020	On the ride to the city,
1334020	1336420	John placed a call to Harry Klinker
1336420	1338340	and immediately realized they had packed
1338340	1341540	and failed to deactivate the cell phone jammer.
1341540	1343300	As John waited for Harry to pick up,
1343300	1346020	Keith began to receive missed calls
1346020	1348180	and voicemail notifications.
1348180	1349960	On the phone, John asked Harry
1349960	1351780	if he knew where everyone had gone
1351780	1354140	but the gravel-voiced man could only guess.
1354140	1356700	Harry, in turn, began to ask about the actions
1356700	1358540	of the officers and lie the protests
1358540	1362260	but was happy to side with his daycare alumni.
1362260	1365320	Harry was always something of a confidant for the officers
1365320	1368040	and so John began spilling details
1368040	1370160	of the bizarre events they had witnessed
1370160	1371400	in the last few days,
1371400	1374040	much to the surprise of everyone else in the car,
1374040	1376280	especially Doug Jacobs.
1376280	1377960	Harry expressed some worry
1377960	1381600	suggesting a spiritualist might be useful to John
1381600	1385160	so John inquired about Harry's partner, Gary Daley,
1385160	1387760	who dabbled in acting as a medium.
1387760	1391000	Harry admitted Gary hadn't come home the night before.
1391000	1392720	He did say that Gary had been meeting
1392720	1394780	with his book group more regularly,
1394780	1396900	a gathering of occultists that included
1396900	1399700	Dr. Marie Jacobs and Mildred Mitchell.
1399700	1403260	John thanked the barman and ended the call.
1403260	1405900	Keith had received a single text
1405900	1408780	and four voicemails while the jammer had been active,
1408780	1411180	all from John Lee Pettymore IV.
1411180	1413860	John ranted about Keith breaking in,
1413860	1415540	fucking with his Smokies,
1415540	1419060	and admitted that he had $5 million.
1419060	1420540	The group texted Drew,
1420540	1423900	asking him to keep an eye on contention in their absence.
1423900	1426940	Doug Chad clarified that his central motivation
1426940	1428480	was returning to his own body,
1428480	1431980	but that he was willing to help for some cash on the side.
1431980	1433240	At Doug's suggestion,
1433240	1435940	the officers called Gary Daley on speakerphone
1435940	1437600	and after several rings,
1437600	1439900	they heard Gary in the middle of a conversation.
1439900	1442580	I told you, you old witch, you're just going crazy,
1442580	1444540	you know, that's all, that's fine,
1444540	1446660	and we can deal with that, hello.
1446660	1449340	The group suggested Gary check in with Harry.
1449340	1451100	When they asked about the witch,
1451100	1453540	Gary explained he was chatting with Mildred Mitchell,
1454060	1457140	the grandmother of Tildy B. Mitchell at her house.
1457140	1459900	She was suffering a breakdown of sorts.
1459900	1461940	See, Mildred was under the impression
1461940	1464300	that her histories have been split,
1464300	1467220	and she has become obsessed with a picture
1467220	1469540	of the founders of contention.
1469540	1472300	Silas Cole, she insisted, looked different
1472300	1473460	than he did before,
1473460	1477180	less attractive and possibly stupider.
1477180	1480140	Mildred also believed she could see the reflection
1480140	1482280	of Tildy B. in the photo.
1482280	1484400	The officers were shaken by the thought
1484400	1489000	that the gun at least appeared to send people back in time,
1489000	1491520	and the split histories could explain in part
1491520	1493800	their mysterious colleague, Ari.
1493800	1495720	John asked about Gary's grandfather
1495720	1497560	and described the recent dream
1497560	1501120	in which Gary had performed a protection ritual on John.
1501120	1503480	Gary admitted this had indeed occurred
1503480	1506820	and went on to say his grandfather, Gingerfred,
1506820	1510360	had passed down a book with three pages left
1510440	1513120	and instructed Gary to read those pages
1513120	1517080	over the heads of the boys, spilling blood in the process.
1517080	1519920	The reason for this, Gary's grandfather had explained,
1519920	1524920	was that the three men were the key to everything.
1525000	1527240	They thanked the owner of the Daily Pho
1527240	1530060	and prepared to enter the city.
1530980	1534120	The streets of the city were drab, gray,
1534120	1535920	and littered with trash.
1535920	1538300	A foul smell hung in the air
1538300	1541420	and billboards covered the faces of buildings.
1541420	1545340	The city residents seemed bloated and lifeless.
1545340	1547800	In opposition to the industrial gloom,
1547800	1551340	flowers of every shade and shape grew in the alleys
1551340	1553340	and from cracks in the pavement.
1553340	1555960	Rosemary led the officers downtown
1555960	1558940	to a tall granite skyscraper.
1558940	1561100	In a small surveilled parking garage,
1561100	1563820	Rosemary gestured for the officers to enter
1563820	1567460	a small elevator made of polished onyx.
1567460	1571220	Everyone, including Rosemary, agreed that Doug's presence
1571220	1575640	as FBI might prove valuable leverage.
1575640	1580640	Rosemary remained in the garage though as the doors closed.
1581460	1584920	The elevator contained no buttons or floor indicators
1584920	1588260	and for a while it seemed as though it didn't move at all.
1588260	1590900	As John held the gun artifact up to the ceiling
1590900	1592660	and called for an audience,
1592660	1597180	one of the walls opened into a dark room.
1597740	1599300	A spotlight in the center of the room
1599300	1602460	partially lit Marvin Glass.
1602460	1607060	A humanoid figure with a massive gaunt frame
1607060	1612040	dressed in a fitted black tuxedo and a red bow tie.
1612040	1615620	The lower half of Marvin's face was visible in the light.
1615620	1619140	The skin there appeared hairless and translucent.
1619140	1622180	Above the sharp see-through chin,
1622180	1627180	a candy red lipstick messily encircled a round hole.
1627460	1631140	The orifice began to move as Marvin Glass
1631140	1634720	introduced themself and asked if the crew knew
1634720	1636860	why they were in this room.
1636860	1638220	The officers weren't sure.
1638220	1641260	Marvin explained that Ferguson Beans had been trying
1641260	1644740	to buy cocaine from a contention police officer.
1644740	1648620	Cocaine that had been stolen from Marvin Glass.
1648620	1651380	Rosemary was sent to collect the money from the deal.
1651420	1654460	This surprised John who hastily suggested
1654460	1656940	he knew nothing about the cocaine deal
1656940	1659980	and Glass called out the lie for what it was.
1659980	1662540	The officers were confused.
1662540	1664800	Rosemary had been insistent about the gun
1664800	1667320	but Marvin said he sent her specifically
1667320	1668500	to recover the money.
1668500	1670740	They pulled Doug Chad aside and instructed him
1670740	1673920	to say the money had been confiscated by the FBI.
1673920	1677980	Marvin flew into a rage before quickly calming down.
1677980	1681580	He explained that Alfred's state was pitiable
1681580	1684500	but not the current concern.
1684500	1686800	John clarified it was germane they were hoping
1686800	1688540	to return to Marvin.
1688540	1690280	John laid the situation out.
1690280	1693260	It wouldn't be long before whatever haunted contention
1693260	1695720	made its way into the city.
1695720	1699780	Marvin explained in plain words that they cared more
1699780	1702540	for the money than for their missing son.
1702540	1705420	Realizing the extent of their miscalculation,
1705420	1708660	the officers began to switch blame to Rosemary.
1708660	1711380	Marvin became increasingly agitated
1711380	1715340	as John recalled the money had been in the woman's hand
1715340	1720280	but she let it go for the promise of this strange gun.
1720280	1724020	Marvin revealed they had orchestrated the killing
1724020	1728780	of Ferguson Beans through Keith's niece, Francis Beans.
1728780	1732940	Glass congratulated him on finishing the job so effectively.
1732940	1736780	Francis herself emerged from the darkness behind the desk
1736780	1740360	and flipped her uncle, Double Birds, as a third figure
1740360	1743700	with spiky white hair and a long white lab coat
1743700	1746120	joined the glass retinue.
1746120	1749940	This mad scientist stood tall behind Francis Beans
1749940	1753860	and slowly tapped long, wobbly fingers
1753860	1757340	against her protege's collarbones.
1757340	1759480	John and Keith doubled down on their denial
1759480	1761700	of all these events but as the women backed
1761740	1764420	into the darkness, Keith stepped forward
1764420	1766540	and asked for his money.
1766540	1768940	Marvin told him he would receive his winnings
1768940	1771940	if he was able to prove himself worthy.
1771940	1773860	Marvin offered John support
1773860	1776820	if he could prove himself capable.
1776820	1780380	They then apologized to Clark for having to be in the room
1780380	1784700	which began to fill with a noxious gas.
1784700	1787900	Clark ran to the elevator but failed to pry it open.
1787900	1790720	John asked Keith point blank if he had sold them out
1790760	1793620	and Keith denied it before passing out.
1795920	1798520	The officers woke in separate cages
1798520	1801480	to the sounds of a jubilant crowd.
1801480	1806400	The cages hung from the ceiling of a smoky, dimly lit room.
1806400	1808920	Three other cages were present populated
1808920	1813160	by a muscled stranger, a malnourished child
1813160	1816960	and Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.
1816960	1820880	Below, the audience indulged in vices
1820880	1824880	and crowded the middle of the room on couches, cushions,
1824880	1828040	piles of blankets, a papasan chair.
1828040	1832520	The sinners eagerly watched two teenagers fight
1832520	1837020	in a plexiglass cage hanging over the center of the space.
1837020	1840080	The crowd cheered as one teen began
1840080	1844160	to viciously beat the other, spraying those below
1844160	1846360	with blood through holes
1846360	1850000	in the elevated fighting box's floor.
1850000	1853040	Keith checked his underwear to see
1853040	1856240	if his tiny gun had been seized.
1856240	1860560	Thankfully for all of them, it had not.
1860560	1863360	The winner of the bloody fight stumbled to his feet
1863360	1865720	and tried to run back to his cage which had locked
1865720	1869720	into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room
1869720	1872120	but he slipped on the blood of the beaten boy
1872160	1875600	and panicked as the ceiling began to lower.
1875600	1878720	The weakened champion boy scraped and crawled
1878720	1882720	just quickly enough to slide into his cube of metal bars
1882720	1887160	as the ersatz ceiling closed in on the perforated floor
1887160	1891800	eliciting a guttural moan from the deceased,
1891800	1895640	crushed, juiced boy.
1895640	1898480	The blood rained down onto the gaudy
1898480	1900400	and deranged crowd below.
1900400	1904440	Many held their mouths open and tongues out.
1904440	1908560	The two cages attached to the plexiglass combat cage closed
1908560	1911480	and withdrew through an exit in the wall,
1911480	1914200	taking the winner of the fight with them.
1914200	1915840	The officers did some quick math
1915840	1918280	and realized their turn would come soon.
1918280	1921000	Keith had indeed located his tiny powerful gun
1921000	1923160	in his briefs and he called over to Doug
1923160	1926080	to confirm the man was still suggestible.
1926080	1929160	As a precautionary measure, they told him losing
1929160	1931960	would allow him to wake up from the nightmare
1931960	1934480	he believed he was experiencing.
1934480	1937240	As retribution for the current state of affairs,
1937240	1940080	John attempted to urinate on the audience
1940080	1943360	but slipped and fell on his own penis.
1943360	1945960	A few members of the audience happily bathed
1945960	1948320	in the bloody urine he emitted.
1948320	1950400	Clark Bishop scanned the crowd
1950400	1952960	and noticed several important figures
1952960	1955320	including the mayor, the chief of police
1955320	1958120	and the district attorney of the city.
1958120	1960680	Keith looked for a host or leader of the event
1960680	1964640	and spotted at the bar a lone black clad figure
1964640	1967560	who sported a mustache and medical scars
1967560	1969440	on his forehead and neck.
1969440	1972000	The man seemed to be watching over the event
1972000	1974440	rather than partaking.
1974440	1977520	As Clark rechecked his cage, it began to move
1977520	1981560	along the conveyor and toward the plexiglass room.
1981560	1985440	The cage of the malnourished boy followed suit.
1985440	1987880	As the cages locked onto the combat chamber,
1988640	1990560	their doors opened and a buzzer sounded,
1990560	1995160	eliciting a new wave of cheering from the audience.
1995160	1998240	The child, not older than 12, slowly crawled
1998240	2000560	from the cage and stood.
2000560	2004080	He began to beat his chest and scream.
2004080	2006160	Clark called down through the plexiglass
2006160	2008600	trying to convince someone in the crowd
2008600	2010800	to put an end to the fight.
2010800	2012800	Clark's failure to rally the audience
2012800	2015600	saw him caught off guard when the boy flung himself
2015640	2018720	across the room and kicked the officer's head.
2018720	2021040	The kick sent Clark into a rage
2021040	2023280	and he turned on the malnourished boy.
2023280	2025560	The two began to grapple but Clark easily
2025560	2027520	gained an advantage on the small child
2027520	2029840	pressing him into the floor of the room.
2029840	2032520	The boy's eyes widened as he saw the ceiling
2032520	2034480	of the cage begin to descend.
2034480	2038240	Clark bashed the boy's head against the plexiglass
2038240	2040840	hoping to render him unconscious.
2040840	2043640	When the boy finally went under, Officer Bishop stood
2043640	2045600	and began to proclaim his innocence
2045600	2048080	seeing as the boy had attacked first.
2048080	2051400	The crowd laughed as the ceiling closed in on the two.
2051400	2053600	Clark grabbed the boy and dragged him
2053600	2055840	across the room toward his cage.
2055840	2058080	As soon as Clark crossed the threshold with the boy,
2058080	2061880	the cage electrified and the officer's skin cooked.
2061880	2064640	But when Officer Bishop pushed the boy back out
2064640	2067800	under the looming human garlic press,
2067800	2070080	the electrical current terminated.
2070080	2073160	The boy's body was pressed through the holes
2073520	2075320	in the bottom of the combat room,
2075320	2079520	the pulp of which rained down on the crowd below.
2079520	2082960	Clark's cage disengaged and headed away
2082960	2086680	but seemed to jam and stopped just short at the dark exit.
2086680	2089320	50 yards away, the two other officers noticed
2089320	2092600	the word mayhem tattooed on the back of the muscled man
2092600	2097200	who then introduced himself as Oz Mayhem Wolf.
2097200	2099960	Oz couldn't locate Marvin in the crowd
2099960	2102920	but revealed the man in black was Kevin.
2102920	2104960	Marvin's head of security.
2104960	2107520	John asked Oz if a large amount of money
2107520	2109600	might persuade Marvin to free them
2109600	2112200	and Oz scoffed at the idea.
2112200	2116080	People in their situation were for sport, not work.
2116080	2119960	Oz explained the fights in the den of sin were easy.
2119960	2123440	Keith considered his chances against a man like Oz
2123440	2125400	and began to weep.
2125400	2127480	He attempted to trigger the door release
2127480	2130120	just as the cage began to move.
2130120	2133200	Keith's skin burned as his cage locked
2133200	2137440	against the plexiglass wall and John Lee Pettymore's cage
2137440	2140160	locked into the other side of the room.
2140160	2143760	The two men surveyed each other across the blood pool
2143760	2146400	that once made up a child.
2146400	2147940	Keith reached into his underwear,
2147940	2150680	grasping his tiny but powerful gun
2150680	2151960	and the men worked together,
2151960	2155880	Keith blasting the floor and John stomping on the cracks.
2155880	2159520	When stray shots killed denizens of the den of sin,
2159520	2162600	others rushed in to lap up their blood.
2162600	2166940	It took three jumps to bust through the perforated circle
2166940	2171040	of plexiglass floor and the two officers landed directly
2171040	2174280	on a man in a papasan, crushing him.
2174280	2176160	The crowd went wild.
2176160	2178640	Some attempted to flee while others basked
2178640	2180180	in the violent scene.
2180180	2183240	Keith fired toward the bar but missed Kevin,
2183240	2185940	obliterating the barkeep instead.
2185940	2189080	In a rage, John flew at the nearest attendee,
2189600	2192760	a man with a curly mustache and a flowing ascot.
2192760	2197760	He screamed into the throng while Clark spat from above.
2198240	2201280	The crowd quickly dissipated, leaving a small group
2201280	2204960	of people obsessively drinking and snorting the blood
2204960	2206000	on the ground.
2206000	2207680	Kevin also remained.
2207680	2210960	The man hadn't moved from his place at the bar.
2210960	2214240	Keith tried to tackle this mysterious head of security
2214240	2218320	but Kevin caught him midair and slammed Officer Vigna's head
2218400	2222440	into the bar, leaving him limp and unconscious.
2222440	2226160	As Clark shook his cage above, John rushed to Keith
2226160	2228560	and grabbed the tiny gun from his hands.
2228560	2232000	Looking into Kevin's eyes, John felt as though
2232000	2236160	he recognized this man but couldn't quite place him.
2236160	2238600	Kevin's dead stare seemed to flicker
2238600	2240520	with the same acknowledgement.
2240520	2243200	And John seized the moment to fire a couple rounds
2243200	2244040	at the man.
2244040	2246200	He missed and Kevin broke for the door,
2246200	2249760	leaving John to nurse his penis amidst the carnage.
2249760	2252440	As the last of the crowd ran from the room,
2252440	2255160	Clark's cell broke from the ceiling.
2255160	2257480	The door opened as it struck the floor
2257480	2260840	but Clark was pierced by one of the cage's bars
2260840	2264520	and his body came to rest, listless at the bottom
2264520	2265460	of the cage.
2267000	2271000	John Lee Pettymore IV found himself the sole surviving cop
2271000	2273880	from contention here in the Den of Sin.
2273880	2277720	Two creepy twins were still in the den trying to sneak out
2277720	2280440	but John caught them and found out they designed
2280440	2283320	the security system here in Marvin's lair.
2283320	2286120	John tried to bargain with them to escort him out
2286120	2289200	with limited success so he shot one in the knee.
2289200	2293400	Fearful, the twins swore to pay John $5 million
2293400	2295680	in exchange for their lives.
2295680	2298560	This was interrupted by a voice near Clark Bishop's
2298560	2300360	shish kebabed corpse.
2300360	2302960	John looked over and saw a hunched man wearing
2302960	2307280	an old tattered robe with a hood that covered his face.
2307280	2310760	The voice was crackly and muttering something ancient
2310760	2311960	and jaunty.
2311960	2314840	A bright light began to form under the hood
2314840	2317720	that was obfuscating this being's face.
2317720	2320160	As it reached its hands into the light,
2320160	2324000	the hood was drawn back and this old man ripped
2324000	2328240	an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face.
2328240	2332160	This much older Clark Bishop took his beaming hands,
2332160	2334960	reached deep into the chest of the unconscious
2334960	2339240	Clark Bishop, yanked the bar from his younger self's chest
2339240	2343240	and threw his limp former body over his older
2343240	2344640	cloaked shoulder.
2344640	2347840	The two Clark Bishops, old and dead respectively,
2347840	2351480	then disappeared in a ball of light.
2351480	2355120	The off-putting brothers, Rich and Richard Nichols,
2355120	2358360	told John Lee Pettymore IV that John Peters
2358360	2360960	had tried to big time it at the den.
2360960	2364760	Apparently he had posted online about these visions
2364760	2366760	he saw while in a coma.
2366760	2370240	When he came out of the coma, he was visited by an agent,
2370240	2374320	Victor, who told him about a mind probing device
2374320	2376720	being used by ISIS.
2376720	2379560	John shot Richard Nichols in the other knee
2379560	2382760	and then he finished the job and put old Dick Nichols
2382760	2385320	out of his pleasurable misery.
2385320	2387960	Rich began drinking his brother's blood
2387960	2390280	before John forced him out of the den
2390320	2392320	into a long hallway where they found
2392320	2395280	the individual rooming quarters of Rosemary,
2395280	2398280	Kevin, Charles and Francis.
2398280	2401560	Rosemary had a framed picture of germane glass
2401560	2403560	hidden under her pillow.
2403560	2406640	On the photo of the slender, muscular man
2406640	2409440	with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms
2409440	2412080	going down to his hands and fingertips,
2412080	2415560	there was a sharpied heart around this man's face,
2415560	2418080	which was stoic, almost blank.
2418080	2420840	Kevin had a Spartan room with a desk,
2420840	2422960	bed and a chest of drawers.
2422960	2427960	Under the desk, he had carved repeatedly, not Kevin.
2428360	2432200	In between the mattress and box spring, there was a notepad.
2432200	2435200	On every page, it said,
2435200	2438160	I had the same dream again last night.
2438160	2443160	She just says, I'm so sorry, he's just so beautiful.
2443200	2447600	You don't have to do this, we can leave, we can run.
2447600	2451120	Carved repeatedly inside the chest of drawers
2451120	2454920	was the phrase, Mary in the woods.
2456240	2459520	Charles was doing extensive research on contention,
2459520	2462040	including the Piston Pig Farm.
2462040	2464280	A draft email on his computer revealed
2464280	2467600	that he and Rosemary had run into Tilde B
2467600	2469920	in possession of the gun.
2469920	2472280	Francis's room was a complete wreck,
2472280	2474160	but was covered in advanced,
2474160	2477320	seemingly impossible mathematical equations.
2477320	2481160	There was also a small drawing of one of the small spheres.
2481160	2484240	As John and Rich began to leave the dorm area,
2484240	2487120	they noticed four figures in brown uniforms
2487120	2489040	with fishhook sides,
2489040	2492720	dragging the body of Keith Vigna down the hallway
2492720	2494400	into an elevator.
2494400	2496440	Continuing the search across the hallway
2496440	2498720	in a room lined with file cabinets,
2498720	2502000	John Lee Pettymore IV found his own file.
2502000	2505960	He learned that he was adopted by John Lee Pettymore III
2505960	2508240	from Cole's orphanage.
2508240	2511760	The next file he found was Kevin's.
2511760	2513720	There was a picture attached.
2513720	2515560	Missing the surgical scars
2515560	2519120	and looking much younger and happier than Kevin,
2519120	2522720	the hollow shell of a man working for Marvin Glass,
2522720	2527680	John recognized his father, John Lee Pettymore III.
2527680	2531760	The file revealed that an unknown, alias Kyle,
2531760	2534120	Anne Love, alias Karen,
2534120	2537920	and John Lee Pettymore III, alias Kevin,
2537920	2541200	were once a team called K-Cell.
2541200	2543600	Marvin Glass caught Kevin and Kyle,
2543600	2546240	but Karen was able to escape.
2546240	2550760	Marvin supernaturally forced Kevin to kill Kyle.
2550760	2554760	Glass was after information on how the sphere worked.
2554760	2558080	John also came across a file named Satan
2558080	2560880	with a picture of a disturbing-looking woman
2560880	2564280	with a mouth that not only took up half of her face,
2564280	2567160	it showed an amount of unbridled pleasure
2567160	2569640	he could barely comprehend.
2569640	2572800	Kevin, the empty vessel that was once John's father,
2572800	2574800	found the snooping pair
2574800	2577880	and began emptying clips into the room.
2577880	2581800	John IV sacrificed Rich Nichols to Kevin's withering fire
2581800	2584160	before attempting to face down his father
2584160	2586960	with Keith's small but powerful pistol.
2586960	2590160	John winged Kevin, revealing mechanical components
2590200	2592320	below his skin, but to no avail,
2592320	2595880	as John Lee Pettymore IV was immediately mowed down
2595880	2598120	by his own adopted father.
2598120	2601160	And then the world was dark for John,
2601160	2604800	but he still felt very much alive.
2604800	2609680	He was moving, like Gogurt busting out of a plastic tube
2609680	2610920	by pressure alone.
2610920	2615840	He felt himself squeeze out of a dark constricting space
2615840	2620280	onto the cold, hard floor, and he began rolling.
2620280	2622840	His limbs extended from his form
2622840	2625400	and slammed into the file cabinet walls
2625400	2626840	on either side of him.
2626840	2629560	It gave John, or whatever John now was,
2629560	2633560	the leverage he needed to fling his silver round frame
2633560	2634800	at his target.
2634800	2636640	As he landed down on Kevin,
2636640	2639360	one of his appendages sliced into the soft tissue
2639360	2641240	on the back of his prey's neck.
2641240	2643520	Another snapped Kevin's head forward,
2643520	2645800	and John could feel the fracture
2646640	2649400	as a third reached in, gripped the top of the spine,
2649400	2651880	and ripped the entire spinal cord
2651880	2656160	out of John Lee Pettymore III's body in one swift motion,
2656160	2661160	promptly forcing itself into the then vacant spinal column
2661600	2664080	of this human being.
2664080	2666840	Keith Vigna, unconscious, perhaps dead,
2666840	2670640	saw himself violently holding a pillow over someone's face
2670640	2675120	when the pillow itself transformed into an oily black ooze,
2675120	2678480	and it washed over the face below it, not of a person,
2678480	2680840	but the face of the watch his father, William,
2680840	2684080	gave his brother, Ferguson, so many years ago.
2684080	2686720	Looking down at his wrist, he was wearing this watch,
2686720	2689760	but when he looked up, he didn't recognize the world.
2689760	2692720	Dust clouds settled to reveal a horse
2692720	2696040	pulling a wagon through a small frontier town,
2696040	2699280	and the bald man Keith knew as Billy Harrison,
2699280	2702320	the one who took Keith's uniform and gun in the clinic,
2702320	2704480	he was walking in Keith's direction,
2704480	2705800	and he kept repeating,
2705800	2708800	I did everything that you asked me to do, Officer Vigna.
2708800	2710800	Holding up the strange looking camera
2710800	2713880	Officer Pettymore found in the car of Julie Maxwell,
2713880	2716080	Harrison took a picture of Vigna.
2716080	2718840	The light was blinding, and as it faded,
2718840	2722720	Keith was standing in darkness, dank and chilly.
2722720	2725520	Right in front of Keith was a massive tank
2725520	2730120	filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze.
2730120	2732600	Keith pressed his face against the tank
2732640	2735040	to see something creeping toward him,
2735040	2739000	and as the face of Tildy B. Mitchell came into focus,
2739000	2741720	Keith stood in an open field,
2741720	2744640	the dead grass covered in a thin freeze
2744640	2748760	crunching under his feet as he approached a metal hatch,
2748760	2752520	but water, gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge
2752520	2756680	began spewing from the creases of this metal hatch.
2756680	2760720	The water began to flood this field at an alarming pace.
2760720	2762640	Keith looked down and saw his reflection
2762640	2766560	in the rippling water, but something looked off.
2766560	2770640	Keith came to in a strange room on an operating table.
2770640	2774240	The room was lined with jars of organs and body parts
2774240	2778920	as well as tubes that ran to vats filled with fish.
2778920	2781680	The tall mad scientist with spiky white hair
2781680	2784960	woke up a dude with brown hair and frosted tips
2784960	2788360	wearing frat boy clothes and a puka shell necklace.
2788360	2790280	His name was Bread.
2790800	2792600	The scientist clicked a button and both Keith
2792600	2795640	and the fratty Bread felt an intense pain
2795640	2797360	through their entire bodies.
2797360	2800320	She clicked the button again and the pain was gone.
2800320	2803840	Suddenly, a fish head with a small human body
2803840	2806240	popped out of Bread's pocket.
2806240	2809360	The little fish fella was curious about the world.
2809360	2811440	Both he and Bread had never left the room
2811440	2813440	and they were really hoping Keith could help them
2813440	2814960	venture into the beyond.
2814960	2818160	Keith promised the two experiments he would take them
2818160	2820400	to Las Vegas if they could help him.
2820400	2823920	Just then, Keith's niece, Frances, came into the room.
2823920	2827640	She showed Keith a mirror to reveal surgical scars
2827640	2830960	across his brow, down his nose, past his lip
2830960	2833080	and onto his collarbone.
2833080	2836360	There were also scars from the tip of his finger
2836360	2838120	up to his elbow.
2838120	2841720	She explained they had brought him back to life
2841720	2843680	with a few upgrades.
2843680	2846680	He had a supply of cocaine in his forearm
2846680	2848680	which could be shot out of his index finger
2848680	2852160	into his new metal nose, a nose capable of handling
2852160	2855800	as much cocaine as his internal organs could muster.
2855800	2858960	He also lost his ability to empathize with humanity,
2858960	2861400	something brand new to Keith Vigna,
2861400	2863920	the now partially mechanical man.
2863920	2867600	Keith named the little fishman Peter Dieter.
2867600	2870000	After Frances left the room, Bread and Peter
2870000	2872000	freed Keith from his restraints.
2872000	2875920	Keith, only in his surgery gown, threw on Bread's
2875920	2878800	extra clothes, a too tight orange polo,
2878800	2881760	teal shorts that were three sizes too big
2881760	2884800	and a pair of Sperrys and put Peter Dieter
2884800	2885760	up on his shoulder.
2885760	2888320	They all left the room and as they tried to find the exit,
2888320	2891040	they happened upon a black marble hallway
2891040	2894280	with a massive door at the end and four guards
2894280	2897040	with scythes shaped like fish hooks.
2897040	2900440	The guards looked like fish people, like Peter,
2900440	2902760	but fully grown, human sized.
2902760	2905560	As Keith, Bread and Peter bailed,
2905560	2907080	Frances intercepted the group
2907080	2909720	and took them to see Marvin Glass.
2909720	2912560	They walked back into that black marble hallway,
2912560	2916120	through the enormous door at the end and into a room
2916120	2917920	the size of a basketball court.
2917920	2921200	One wall was made entirely of glass,
2921200	2924800	which looked into a murky aquarium.
2924800	2927120	Marvin stood there, looking into the water
2927120	2931560	before he turned around to face the chai fraps.
2931560	2934200	Frances clicked a button on a small remote
2934200	2937560	and everyone in the frappe frat was paralyzed.
2937560	2941520	With a clear upper hand, Marvin offered Keith a deal.
2941520	2945080	He would give the new metal vigna the $1 million earned
2945080	2947840	by killing Ferguson if Keith will do
2947840	2950280	just one more thing for Marvin.
2950280	2953400	To show the former police officer, current android,
2953400	2956760	how serious he was, Marvin grabbed Peter,
2956760	2960960	walked back over to the unfathomably massive aquarium
2960960	2964560	and reached unnaturally through the glass.
2964560	2967680	He placed Peter Dieter into the murky water
2967680	2972680	and pulled his gaunt spindly arm back into his dry office.
2972960	2976320	Some sort of giant fish monster in the aquarium
2976320	2979880	swam by and swallowed Peter Dieter
2979880	2982240	as everyone in the room watched.
2982240	2984600	Marvin then set his sights on Bread.
2984600	2987440	He took the frat boy apart piece by piece
2987440	2991880	until the problematic robotic boy could no longer function.
2991880	2994440	Then Marvin Glass assigned the new Keith vigna
2994440	2996120	to his next task.
2996120	2999320	In order to prove Keith's loyalty and pay his debt,
2999320	3002440	Keith must go to the Manstein funeral
3002440	3007440	and bring back Stan Manstein, Ari's father, for questioning.
3007640	3009200	Keith agreed.
3009200	3012000	A thick fog obfuscated Clark's vision.
3012000	3015240	The air, like gravity, felt stronger than normal
3015280	3017480	and the whisper of a familiar voice
3017480	3019960	sent a shiver down his spine.
3019960	3022320	Clark sensed a sudden drop in temperature
3022320	3024520	as a stainless steel door appeared
3024520	3026120	and it opened in front of him.
3026120	3028760	Behind, a woman began to scream.
3028760	3030720	When he turned around, he was greeted by the face
3030720	3033760	of Tildy B. Mitchell on a television screen.
3033760	3036200	In a shaky voice, she began repeating herself
3036200	3041200	over and over, bonus round, bonus round, bonus round.
3042240	3044400	Suddenly, Clark was running down the street,
3044400	3046320	the street on which he lived.
3046320	3049080	He noted a familiar boy about to enter the house
3049080	3050080	on the left.
3050080	3054400	Clark tried to scream, but the fog veiled him once again.
3054400	3057960	His screams echoed infinitely into the endlessness
3057960	3059280	that engulfed him.
3059280	3062140	Then, a new voice reached him and he looked up
3062140	3066320	to see the face of his once mentor, Gerald Fingerson.
3066320	3068800	It had been some time since the two had seen each other,
3068800	3071320	but Gerald had aged with grace.
3071320	3074120	It was December 6th, a crisp winter morning
3074680	3076480	and Clark was dressed only in briefs
3076480	3079800	and a pump and dump branded t-shirt.
3079800	3082960	Clark wore no shoes or socks and despite the cold
3082960	3085680	and the recent events, the man felt amazing,
3085680	3087360	the best he'd felt in a long time.
3087360	3089480	A string was wrapped around Clark's wrist
3089480	3093460	and attached to a bag of ice from which protruded a rod.
3093460	3096260	The bag of ice leaked red liquid down the driveway
3096260	3097480	on which the two men stood,
3097480	3100280	centered in a suburban neighborhood.
3100320	3104360	Clark noted the name Jim Cook on the mailbox nearby.
3104360	3107680	Gerald didn't know how Clark had come to be in the driveway.
3107680	3109320	He discovered him there as the officer
3109320	3110900	regained consciousness.
3110900	3113760	Clark hastily recalled the events in the Den of Sin,
3113760	3116000	none of which were familiar to Gerald.
3116000	3118760	Opening the bag of ice, Clark recognized the bar
3118760	3121560	was pulled from a cage in the Den of Sin.
3121560	3123840	As he checked himself for wounds that might account
3123840	3125800	for the blood, Clark pulled up his shirt
3125800	3129760	to reveal a gaping hole where his heart should be,
3129760	3132320	lined with skin and cartilage.
3132320	3137280	He was rightfully shaken, despite feeling physically well.
3137280	3139680	Gerald declined to touch Clark's body hole
3139680	3141620	and suggested they step inside the house
3141620	3143400	where he'd planned to share a dinner
3143400	3146200	of cashew chicken with Jim Cook.
3146200	3147760	Clark had to inform Gerald
3147760	3150600	that Jim had been found dead in an alley.
3150600	3152600	Clark and Gerald decided it would be wise
3152600	3154720	to leave the street and made their way
3154720	3157360	into the unlocked Cook residence.
3157360	3159520	The house was older but cozy.
3160120	3162920	Papers and binders were strewn across the living room,
3162920	3166200	covering every surface and stagnant dust
3166200	3168200	hung in the light from the window.
3168200	3169960	Clark made his way to the bedroom
3169960	3172200	and donned a pair of Jim Cook's pants,
3172200	3174320	several sizes too small.
3174320	3176880	Back downstairs, Clark noticed a picture
3176880	3179320	of his parents on the fridge.
3179320	3181920	They were posed in silly hats with Jim Cook
3181920	3184520	who smiled begrudgingly long.
3184520	3186480	His investigation further discovered
3186480	3188920	a bullet-torn tarot card.
3188920	3191840	The major arcana card, the devil,
3191840	3193720	and a taxidermied baby squirrel
3193720	3196680	bagged and placed in a chest of drawers.
3196680	3200160	Behind the couch, Clark noticed an empty holster.
3200160	3204480	The words, scientia morse est, were tooled into the leather.
3204480	3208560	Below that was a dash and an uppercase K.
3208560	3212240	In the bathroom, Clark found a smooth silver ring
3212240	3214240	with a plateau on top.
3214240	3216960	Two books stood out among the papers in the living room.
3216960	3219080	The leather cover of the thicker tome
3219080	3221600	was embossed with a familiar symbol,
3221600	3224880	a large circle surrounded by six smaller circles,
3224880	3228120	and the other was a thin, red notebook.
3228120	3230280	It seemed vaguely familiar.
3230280	3232280	Clark opened the leather tome
3232280	3234520	where a girthy wooden bookmark
3234520	3236360	had been placed near the back.
3236360	3239600	Written over and over on the ancient parchment
3239600	3240720	was the phrase,
3240720	3245680	it is only through death that he may rise again.
3245680	3247800	Drawn over the obsessive scrawling
3247800	3250200	was a hooded figure with brilliant light
3250200	3252200	shining from its maw.
3252200	3254760	The book closed with supernatural force
3254760	3256680	as Clark tried to flip forward
3256680	3260120	and an envelope fluttered out from between its pages.
3260120	3264280	Inside the envelope was a letter signed by Jim Cook.
3264280	3267400	Jim seemed to be refuting something called
3267400	3270400	the revelation of the overseer,
3270400	3273400	calling it the scratches of a broken man.
3273400	3277280	The letter went on to outline a set of new guidelines,
3277280	3279320	including the immediate reassignment
3279320	3283080	of all members of the disposal unit.
3283080	3285880	The circle symbol was present at the top of the letter
3285880	3287960	and it was accompanied by the creed,
3287960	3292160	faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
3292160	3295840	The clicking hammer of a cocked gun startled Clark.
3295840	3297560	He raised his hands in the air,
3297560	3300600	dripping blood from the ice bag.
3300600	3303200	Chief Maggie Cook spoke behind him,
3303200	3305480	leveling her pistol at his back.
3306400	3310640	Clark, what the hell are you doing in my daddy's house?
3310640	3312600	Tears formed in Clark's eyes
3312600	3315080	as he and Maggie lowered their arms.
3315080	3318000	Gerald halfheartedly stood between the two
3318000	3321360	as Clark explained that he thought Maggie was dead.
3321360	3324040	The former chief also confessed an amount of confusion
3324040	3327640	and the two awkwardly sandwiched Gerald in a hug.
3327680	3331080	Clark told Maggie he'd seen the charred remains of her body
3331080	3333080	and he withdrew from the embrace.
3333080	3335640	The woman was dressed in a dark hoodie and jeans
3335640	3337240	and it marked the first time Clark
3337240	3339760	had ever seen her out of uniform.
3339760	3343480	She brushed by him to retrieve the red notebook.
3343480	3345440	Maggie was unsure of what to make
3345440	3347920	of Clark's presence in her father's home.
3347920	3350200	He explained he had gaps in his memory
3350200	3352080	and Maggie prodded Clark's chest
3352080	3354200	where the tunnel had formed.
3354200	3357560	She gasped as Clark lifted his shirt.
3357560	3361320	Immediately excited, she insisted Clark follow her,
3361320	3363040	that she'd been waiting a long time
3363040	3364560	for these events to occur.
3364560	3366280	Gerald interjected claiming
3366280	3368920	that Maggie had always been a bitch
3368920	3371760	and Maggie asked if Clark was all right.
3371760	3376760	He began to realize Maggie couldn't see Gerald Ferguson.
3377040	3379120	Gerald's voice became echoey
3379120	3381280	as he frantically tried to convince Clark
3381280	3383560	that Maggie was not to be trusted.
3383560	3386440	Addressing Maggie, he insinuated that Clark knew
3386440	3389880	what was at the mill before Clark approached the old man,
3389880	3393160	reaching out to his librarian mentor.
3393160	3397040	As they grasped hands, Clark felt nothing but air.
3398280	3400200	Gerald Ferguson dissipated.
3401080	3405080	Clark, are you with me?
3405080	3405920	Are you here?
3406920	3409840	Clark turned solemnly back to Maggie.
3409840	3411120	Before they got to work,
3411120	3413960	Clark suggested he fill his bag with more ice,
3413960	3416440	fearing it contained what had been scraped out
3416440	3418920	to form the tunnel in his chest.
3418920	3421360	Maggie investigated and found a heart
3421360	3424200	impaled on the bottom of the metal rod.
3424200	3426240	Clark emptied Jim's ice trays
3426240	3428800	before joining Maggie in her silver Camry
3428800	3433600	for a ride out to the mill on the other side of the city.
3433600	3437680	Clark used the silent drive to examine the canvas bag
3437680	3439920	next to the human heart in the ice.
3439920	3444920	The bag contained tiles with the letters S-T-L-E-N-R
3446840	3450880	and a symbol, a circle inside a square.
3450880	3453640	Clark quickly determined those are the letters
3453640	3456000	given at the beginning of the bonus round
3456000	3457440	of Wheel of Fortune.
3457440	3459360	Clark broke the silence in the car
3459360	3462320	when he asked Maggie why she was still alive.
3462320	3464680	She answered by explaining that the leather tome
3464680	3467400	in her dad's house contained a prophecy,
3467400	3470800	the revelation of the overseer.
3470800	3473600	The Circle of Knowledge believed the overseer
3473600	3476160	was coming to set an order in the world
3476160	3479080	and they prepared the way and protected the world
3479080	3481320	from unnatural forces.
3481320	3483320	Maggie had been skeptical,
3483320	3485000	but she claimed to be coming around
3485000	3487680	to an understanding of the forces at play.
3487680	3491120	She believes fire and fear kept the world safe,
3491120	3493040	that most people couldn't handle the knowledge
3493040	3496080	of the supernatural, but that people like her and Clark
3496080	3498880	and the Circle of Knowledge had been tasked
3498880	3502320	with a responsibility to keep the world moving.
3502320	3504600	Clark admitted to having met Leon Simpson
3504600	3507320	and broke down as he tried to explain the horrors
3507320	3510160	the officers had experienced in her absence.
3510160	3512760	When Clark asked Maggie why she wasn't there,
3512760	3515800	she asked in turn if the ant questions
3515800	3518440	when it's being moved by a boot.
3518440	3521560	She alluded to the idea that much larger things
3521560	3524760	were at work than what Clark had seen so far.
3524760	3526240	They lapsed into silence again
3526240	3529920	as the Camry pulled onto a country road outside of town,
3529920	3532800	passing through a verdant tunnel of trees
3532800	3534320	on the way to the mill.
3534320	3536000	A few miles later, they arrived
3536000	3540480	at the massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks.
3540480	3543480	The mill on the other side of the city
3543480	3545000	was filled with people,
3545000	3547840	none of whom paid any mind to Clark's current dress
3547840	3550680	or the blood dripping from the ice bag he carried.
3550680	3553080	Clark recognized no one.
3553080	3555400	Maggie led them through a secure door in the back
3555400	3558680	and down a spiraling stone staircase.
3558680	3560640	Clark recognized the room at the bottom,
3560640	3563560	circular with six stone slabs.
3563560	3565640	Each slab held two bodies
3565640	3569080	and a xenonimatode was attached to each body.
3569080	3573040	The unconscious figures were covered in open sores
3573040	3577320	from previous placements and their skin was rotted.
3577320	3581000	Maggie led Clark to the center and chuckled grimly,
3581040	3584720	asking Clark to lie down on the middle slab.
3584720	3585880	Clark was reluctant,
3585880	3588720	remembering that Leon had said he would need to sacrifice
3588720	3590640	neither flesh nor limb.
3590640	3592080	Maggie agreed, mostly,
3592080	3594960	but suggested a little flesh was necessary
3594960	3597120	now that the game had changed.
3597120	3598240	Clark called for Leon,
3598240	3600480	but Maggie told them they'd been sent away.
3600480	3603640	She grabbed his shoulders and repeated the creed,
3603640	3605960	faith through knowledge.
3605960	3607520	It's just called knowledge.
3607520	3609960	She claimed Clark needed knowledge
3610000	3611480	and pressed on his chest
3611480	3615040	before moving down to his left foot, still bare.
3615040	3618800	Maggie twisted a circular handle at the base of the slab
3618800	3622720	and pulled up a cartridge the size of a parking pylon.
3622720	3625760	Inside the cartridge was a xenonimatode
3625760	3627200	and with a swift motion,
3627200	3630880	Maggie pulled it out and placed it on Clark's foot.
3630880	3633200	Clark's vision immediately darkened.
3633200	3637560	Suddenly, the ground he stood on was made of light.
3637560	3640320	Clark felt absolute contentment in this new world,
3640320	3644600	but noted he was otherwise surrounded by absolute darkness.
3644600	3647080	12 figures were clear in the distance,
3647080	3650040	as was a giant black mass,
3650040	3652120	all dimly lit from below.
3652120	3655000	The 12 appeared to be following the massive being
3655000	3657200	as they walked away from Clark.
3657200	3658600	When Clark moved closer,
3658600	3661080	he began to hear their chanting.
3661080	3664320	Ahead of them stood a towering beast,
3664320	3667640	its shoulders 25 feet from the ground.
3667640	3672000	As Clark stared, its image seemed to form and reform,
3672000	3675720	changing and glitching and it roared
3675720	3678320	and Clark fell to the ground
3678320	3681000	and began to weep uncontrollably.
3682680	3685160	Clark came to in the mill on the other side of the city
3685160	3688920	as Maggie returned the xenonimatode back into the ground.
3688920	3693080	Clark, that thing's coming and we keep it from coming here.
3693120	3695880	Clark was shaken and he stammered over questions
3695880	3697360	about what he had just witnessed.
3697360	3699320	He asked if there's anything Maggie could do
3699320	3700360	about the heart.
3700360	3702440	She lifted it from the bag by the rod,
3702440	3705240	slowly sliding the organ from the metal.
3705240	3707680	Maggie held the heart in one hand
3707680	3710080	as it began to sputter blood.
3710080	3712840	She calmed Clark and retrieved a small wooden stick
3712840	3713680	from the corner.
3713680	3716560	She ran the stick through the hollow rod
3716560	3718600	and caught two small pieces of metal
3718600	3720560	that emerged from the other end.
3720560	3723120	Maggie reminded Clark of their backup plan
3723120	3727240	from the last job and noted he hadn't come back in time.
3727240	3729080	The circle of knowledge had already tried
3729080	3732360	to take his heart once and yet he still stood.
3732360	3735280	Maggie meditated on the fact that things move stranger
3735280	3737200	in the world than most thought possible.
3737200	3739200	She gave Clark his first job,
3739200	3741960	refusing to answer further questions.
3741960	3744360	The job would take Clark to Ari's funeral
3744360	3746160	at the city cemetery.
3746160	3748600	Maggie admitted to being shaken by the woman's death
3748600	3752040	but it presented an opportunity to be in the same place
3752040	3755920	as Stan Manstein who rarely left the city asylum.
3755920	3758200	Clark's job was to assassinate Stan
3758200	3759800	at his daughter's funeral.
3759800	3761520	Clark was initially horrified
3761520	3764560	but he remembered the unspeakable entity
3764560	3767120	waiting to break into this world,
3767120	3770960	steeled himself and requested a firearm.
3770960	3774520	John Lee Pettymore IV stood in front of a storage unit
3774520	3777600	with a large yellow symbol on the door.
3777600	3780520	It was the logo of the circle of knowledge,
3780520	3783720	six circles surrounding a larger circle.
3783720	3786920	Inside, he found a wooded territory
3786920	3790760	and he was suddenly holding one of the silver balls.
3790760	3793200	It gave off a comforting warmth.
3793200	3797160	Looking out, he saw a sky of endless darkness
3797160	3799960	under which two children held hands.
3799960	3803560	John's senses began to be overwhelmed
3803600	3807600	by the sounds of torment that filled his ears.
3807600	3810360	And then he woke up in the room with the filing cabinets
3810360	3813880	where he had been shot repeatedly by his own father
3813880	3817400	and John was confronted with the sight of his own body
3817400	3818960	dead on the ground.
3818960	3820600	Inspecting his reflection,
3820600	3825400	he saw he was now in his father's former frame.
3825400	3828280	John decided to covertly remain Kevin
3828280	3830200	for as long as he could.
3830200	3833360	Rosemary called for Kevin to join her
3833360	3836640	and John Lee Pettymore IV followed in his new body,
3836640	3839200	though he largely failed in his attempts
3839200	3841440	to extract any intelligence.
3841440	3844000	At the end of a black marble hallway,
3844000	3847560	jumpsuited fishmen guarded Marvin's massive,
3847560	3849760	strange office door.
3849760	3852840	Marvin greeted them, Rosemary and Kevin,
3852840	3856240	and announced they were moving into the final phase
3856240	3858920	of contentions demolition.
3858960	3863800	A small silver sphere sat on a tripod atop Marvin's desk
3863800	3866840	and an intense light show glinted out
3866840	3868760	from the room behind him.
3868760	3872400	Marvin ordered Rosemary and Kevin to go to the funeral
3872400	3875440	of Ari Manstein, the contention police officer,
3875440	3878760	to ensure that the new Charles, Keith Vigna,
3878760	3883200	was successful in his mission to apprehend Stan Manstein.
3883200	3885480	As they headed out into the city,
3885480	3889640	John Lee Kevinmore witnessed a rowdy band of revelers
3889640	3892720	using dirty dog grooming loyalty cards
3892720	3896600	to enter a grate that took them underground.
3896600	3899720	Keith left the glass compound and headed to the funeral
3899720	3902520	of Ari Manstein and his police cruiser.
3902520	3905400	The strange gun and camera with glass tubes
3905400	3908400	were no longer in this car.
3908400	3911960	On his phone, he found multiple missed calls from Drew,
3911960	3915800	as well as a voicemail that said the mass is growing
3915800	3919120	and pleaded for the officers to stay far away
3919120	3920280	from contention.
3920280	3923760	He sounded panicked and the call ended abruptly.
3923760	3927200	Keith chose to not change out of his tight orange polo
3927200	3929880	and big coral shorts and boat shoes.
3929880	3933520	In the city cemetery, the smell of a crawfish boil
3933520	3936440	wafted through the above ground mausoleums
3936440	3939360	and directed Vigna to the funeral,
3939360	3941680	where he spoke briefly to Ari's mother
3941720	3944520	and took a seat in the front row.
3944520	3946840	Clark came to on the concrete slab
3946840	3949680	in the middle of the underground dungeon room
3949680	3953120	below the mill on the other side of the city.
3953120	3954680	Maggie Cook backed away quickly
3954680	3957680	as she lowered the Xenon nematode back into the ground.
3957680	3960880	Maggie moved on, told Clark that after he completed
3960880	3962960	his mission of killing Stan Manstein
3962960	3964360	at Ari Manstein's funeral,
3964360	3966600	he was free to do whatever he pleased.
3966600	3968040	She offered to house him back
3968040	3969720	at the circle of knowledge if he wanted.
3969720	3971200	This job won't be daily.
3971200	3973960	At first, she said, but they would get him trained up
3973960	3976160	and working more often eventually.
3976160	3979520	Clark pressed her on it not being daily.
3979520	3981800	He was shaken by the thing he saw in his vision
3981800	3984600	and wanted to stop it immediately.
3984600	3986720	She was glad to see Clark's fire.
3986720	3990320	She said that's exactly what they need in the organization.
3990320	3993040	Maggie gave Clark a burner phone, a gun,
3993040	3995640	an old contention police uniform,
3995640	3997920	and a silver Honda Accord.
3997920	4002320	She'd be in contact with him the next day, December 7th.
4002320	4005840	Clark stopped for gas on the way to Ari's funeral.
4005840	4007400	While he was busy pumping,
4007400	4009680	a woman stealthily dropped a phone
4009680	4011920	into his car passenger seat.
4011920	4013200	Phone was scrubbed clean,
4013200	4016120	save a single text message that read,
4016120	4019680	do you wanna know why your parents were killed?
4019680	4022720	Clark immediately texted back, who is this?
4022720	4024960	Clark arrived at the city cemetery
4024960	4027600	and followed his nose to a small clearing
4027600	4031040	where a funeral service was set up for Ari Manstein.
4031040	4034240	Ari's mother, Jan, greeted visitors in the front.
4034240	4037320	Sat up there by the crawfish boil was Keith Vigna
4037320	4041440	wearing Sperry boat shoes, big coral blue shorts,
4041440	4043800	and a tight orange polo.
4043800	4046440	From Clark's distance, Keith looked healthy.
4046440	4050680	Clark, however, last remembered seeing Keith fucking die.
4050680	4054000	Then again, Clark seemingly came back from the dead himself,
4054000	4056640	so maybe it wasn't that surprising.
4056640	4059920	Clark didn't see Stan or John Lee Pettymore.
4059920	4062240	Leaning casually against a mausoleum,
4062240	4067200	he tried to inconspicuously hide in the back of the crowd.
4067200	4069880	While Rosemary drove John Lee Pettymore IV
4069880	4072120	and the body of his father, John Lee Pettymore III,
4072120	4075120	whom she knew as Kevin, to the cemetery,
4075120	4079040	Rosemary revealed the news of Charles' death shook her
4079040	4083000	as she thought the enhancements made them more robust.
4083040	4085160	Kevin reflected on the truth.
4085160	4086920	Everything dies.
4086920	4088760	They made their way through the raised
4088760	4091240	New Orleans-style tombs to the funeral
4091240	4094120	where they found a large crawfish boil.
4094120	4096120	John saw Keith sitting in the front row
4096120	4099400	in a ridiculous outfit and Clark near the back
4099400	4102880	in an old-fashioned contention PD uniform.
4102880	4106420	John split away from Rosemary, approached Clark from behind,
4106420	4109320	and muttered, bubblegum tree.
4109320	4112960	Recognizing the body of Kevin, Clark was apprehensive
4112960	4116000	but tentatively responded, bubblegum tree.
4116000	4118480	John Lee Kevinmore said nothing
4118480	4121680	and faded back into the crowd.
4121680	4124440	Jan Manstein settled behind the podium,
4124440	4126280	thanked everyone for coming,
4126280	4128800	and introduced her ex-husband,
4128800	4130420	who doesn't get out very often.
4130420	4132960	Stan Manstein, dressed in all white,
4132960	4135780	his hair and beard both long and tangled,
4135780	4137760	his face weathered like leather,
4137760	4139520	approached the microphone flanked
4139520	4141920	by three heavily armed guards
4141920	4145520	with various scars across their faces.
4145520	4148080	And then Stan began to speak
4148080	4152320	in a fully nonsensical language, but through the noise,
4152320	4156120	the three officers heard Stan in perfect English
4156120	4160400	as time itself began to slow down.
4160400	4165400	My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.
4166400	4169680	She was those things when she was a police officer.
4169680	4172520	She was those things when she was a school teacher.
4172520	4175720	She was those things when she was a historian.
4175720	4179800	You see, one long time ago, when this land was stolen
4179800	4182080	and pioneer towns began to form,
4182080	4185200	Silas Cole was a miner in the mine
4185200	4188860	that employed the town nearby of contention.
4188860	4190800	While down in the mines,
4190800	4194500	Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance
4194540	4197460	and he became obsessed with studying it.
4197460	4201220	The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.
4201220	4204300	Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,
4204300	4207020	he became an inventor and made so much money
4207020	4210140	off of his inventions that he bought the mine.
4210140	4212180	He built an office on the top floor
4212180	4214580	of the tall, skinny mining company building
4214580	4217340	that sat right above the mine itself.
4217340	4219540	He began to harvest the residue
4219540	4223140	and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.
4223180	4225860	He invented wild, magical things.
4225860	4228780	Each new invention brought him wealth and power,
4228780	4233440	but also released more of this inky substance into the town.
4233440	4235700	To divert his raising paranoia,
4235700	4237860	he began looking for a partner.
4237860	4240180	He found a similarly intelligent engineer
4240180	4243740	in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance
4243740	4245980	they began calling residue.
4245980	4248700	But Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.
4248700	4251780	He became paranoid that other people could see the residue
4251820	4254300	that was loose all over the town.
4254300	4257360	Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him,
4257360	4261620	so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much.
4261620	4264780	As Stan spoke, Clark surveyed the crowd,
4264780	4267860	slowed around him as he moved at normal speed.
4267860	4269920	The guards looked slowed as well.
4269920	4271580	Clark made his way to the front.
4271580	4274500	John moved into a position behind Stan.
4274500	4278580	Keith made eye contact with Clark and they bubblegum treed.
4278580	4282140	Clark saw Keith's fresh scars running from his elbow
4282140	4283700	down to the tip of his finger,
4283700	4286520	as well as across his forehead down his face.
4286520	4288740	It didn't seem like the crowd was able
4288740	4290940	to understand Stan's speech,
4290940	4295180	but the three armed guards started to converge on Manstein,
4295180	4297420	though they moved in slow motion.
4297420	4298620	Following his orders,
4298620	4302380	Clark drew his gun and shot Stan in the chest.
4302380	4305460	Time immediately resumed back to normal pace.
4305460	4307860	John Lee Kevin Moore emerged from behind the stage
4307860	4310300	and began firing at one of the armed guards.
4310300	4312480	The crowd dispersed, panicked.
4312480	4314380	Keith joined in firing at the guards
4314380	4316540	with his small, powerful gun.
4316540	4319580	Three gunshots rang out from an unseen location,
4319580	4321540	finishing off one of the scar-faced,
4321540	4323900	black tactical gear-clad guards.
4323900	4327320	Another guard tried to fire off his wire arm,
4327320	4329060	like the android that attacked them
4329060	4330580	at James the Millworker's house,
4330580	4332500	but this time the massive man
4332500	4335020	accidentally hogtied himself.
4335020	4337320	John executed the other robot man
4337320	4340960	and Keith shoved his fingers into Stan's bullet wounds
4340960	4342380	to plug the leaks,
4342380	4345320	which jolted Stan back to consciousness.
4345320	4348040	The restrained robot guard fired at Clark,
4348040	4350560	putting bullets in his chest and arm.
4350560	4354040	Stan mustered the strength to continue his speech
4354040	4358720	and time began to slow once again.
4359880	4362680	The town was suspicious of the disappearances,
4362680	4365880	but most of the ones gone were bad people,
4365880	4368680	the whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty,
4368680	4370800	the piano player, there was a few gamblers,
4370800	4373400	the town drunk, so they kept their heads down
4373400	4375160	and went about their business.
4375160	4377160	But then some good people disappeared,
4377160	4380420	a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,
4380420	4382040	the homesteader's wife.
4382040	4385160	Then the preacher disappeared, the town freaked out
4385160	4388640	and they hired a roaming cowboy named Cornelius Beams
4388640	4392520	to kill their weird, paranoid figurehead.
4392520	4395800	Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.
4395800	4398480	Neither was Cornelius Beams.
4398480	4402280	That was the history of contention,
4402280	4406560	when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or Ben,
4406560	4409360	but her name is Ari forever now
4409360	4411840	and our history is different.
4411840	4414520	Mine is now definite.
4414520	4418960	Upon finishing his speech, Stan's body seemed
4418960	4422080	to instantly turn itself inside out
4422080	4424520	and blip out of existence.
4424520	4427840	Clark lost his shit and charged the hogtied guard
4427840	4428760	who had shot him.
4428760	4432560	Clark unloaded his entire clip into this man's head
4432560	4433840	while screaming.
4433840	4437220	Metallic clangs and buzzes clanged and buzzed,
4437220	4440380	sparks sparkled and wires spilled out
4440380	4442280	of the robot guard's head.
4442280	4443960	The crowd had made a run for it
4443960	4446040	and the three officers stood in silence
4446040	4448900	over the three massacred metal man bodies
4448900	4451820	next to the crawfish boil in the casket.
4451820	4454820	Keith made sure Ari's body was actually in the coffin.
4454820	4455740	It was.
4455740	4458240	Unsure of each other due to Kevin's presence,
4458240	4460940	Keith's scars and Clark's dated uniform,
4460940	4464440	the three men held each other at gunpoint.
4464440	4466000	Bubble gum tree.
4466000	4467380	They lowered their guns.
4467380	4469540	Keith admitted Kevin killed him,
4469540	4472120	but he owed Kevin's organization,
4472120	4474800	the Glass family, for his life.
4474800	4477060	Kevin asked Clark to speak to him alone
4477060	4478980	for a moment without Keith.
4478980	4482040	Keith went and occupied himself with the crawfish pot.
4482040	4485980	Kevin explained he used to be John Lee Pettymore IV.
4485980	4488820	John Lee Pettymore was more of a state of mind.
4488820	4491780	Turned out John's daddy was lobotomized
4491780	4495280	and had been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while.
4495280	4498140	When John died, it seemed he was some kind
4498140	4500860	of alien squid being or something.
4500860	4505240	He sucked out of John's brain and entered his dad's body.
4505240	4508500	Clark tried to clarify the squid being part.
4508540	4509900	Kevin said he didn't really know.
4509900	4511360	Maybe he was just mechanical.
4511360	4516040	He just knew he left John's body and entered Kevin's body,
4516040	4519400	the body of John Lee Pettymore III.
4519400	4522700	John Lee Kevinmore urged Clark to ask him something
4522700	4524340	only John would know.
4524340	4526460	Clark asked him about the little twins
4526460	4528540	they lost to the goo in the suburbs,
4528540	4530660	and John confirmed the story.
4530660	4533600	As they embraced, Clark whispered into John's ear,
4534480	4536520	Maggie's alive.
4536520	4537880	Kevin didn't believe him
4537880	4540260	and proposed that the chief was dead,
4540260	4542920	but that there were other versions of each of them.
4542920	4545920	Kevin explained he saw Clark broken and shattered
4545920	4547960	on the ground back in the Den of Sin,
4547960	4551160	but an older Clark came by, whispered some shit
4551160	4555160	over the body, and the two disappeared in a flash of light.
4555160	4557920	Clark lifted his shirt and showed John the hole
4557920	4560560	through his chest where his heart should have been.
4560560	4563400	Clark told John about waking up with his own heart
4564240	4565640	in a bag and running into Maggie.
4565640	4568200	He said he was now working for the Circle of Knowledge
4568200	4571940	and that Maggie and Jim Cook were both also involved.
4571940	4574560	Clark asked if John knew how Keith survived.
4574560	4577320	John had seen some figures with funny-shaped sides
4577320	4579280	drag Keith's body away.
4579280	4581840	Marvin Glass told John they'd turned Keith
4581840	4583600	into the new Charles.
4583600	4586960	The Glass family performed some sort of upgrade procedure
4586960	4588600	on all of their cronies.
4588600	4591560	Clark asked if John was medley now.
4591560	4594320	Through his bullet holes, they could both see
4594320	4598040	metal lining in the layers of flesh.
4598040	4601040	The two looked back at Keith to see him dipping his hand
4601040	4604400	straight into the boiling pot of crawfish.
4604400	4607320	John walked up to Keith and whispered in his ear,
4607320	4609920	I know what you did to my smokies,
4609920	4611420	and punched him in the gut.
4611420	4614760	Keith realized Kevin was John and gave him a hug.
4614760	4617840	A big smile spread across Keith's face.
4617840	4620160	John stopped him and explained he had learned
4620160	4623880	this was all some kind of business play for Marvin Glass.
4623880	4626300	Marvin wanted to demolish contention
4626300	4627980	so he could have the land.
4627980	4630480	They've got to save the town.
4630480	4633480	Clark shared it may be bigger than just the town.
4633480	4636880	He recounted the vision he saw, barely keeping it together.
4636880	4639400	Clark explained the Circle of Knowledge is a group
4639400	4642580	he worked for now that tried to keep the thing he saw
4642580	4645440	in the vision from becoming a reality.
4645440	4647560	Part of that mission apparently included
4647560	4649400	killing Stan Manstein.
4649400	4652120	That really fucked Keith over.
4652120	4655320	The Glass family rebuilt him and tasked him
4655320	4658420	with bringing Stan back alive.
4658420	4661980	Additionally, Drew had been calling Keith to tell him
4661980	4664280	to get the hell away from contention.
4664280	4667220	Unfortunate because Clark had planned on grabbing his guns
4667220	4670200	and things from his house and moving shop up to the mill
4670200	4672000	on the other side of the city.
4672000	4674560	Keith mused that he hoped the helmet and radio
4674560	4676180	were still in the evidence room
4676180	4678280	at the contention police department.
4678280	4680840	They realized the gun and the camera
4680840	4684380	now likely belonged to Marvin Glass.
4684380	4687440	John thought about it, put his hands up to his head
4687440	4691440	and his eyes went white as he looked elsewhere.
4694120	4697640	John, as your eyes roll backward, your vision goes dark.
4697640	4699960	Images begin flashing through your mind,
4699960	4702820	just snippets, moments, and you try to keep up
4702820	4706120	as the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes.
4706120	4710240	You see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed.
4710240	4712720	You see the sign for Bean's Pond,
4712720	4715260	the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house
4715260	4716480	in contention.
4716480	4717900	You see a television.
4717900	4720320	It's blinking with different letters on it.
4720320	4724320	R-S-T-L-N-E.
4724320	4726560	You see a small clearing in the woods.
4726560	4728520	The ground is scorched.
4728520	4732180	In a dark room lit by various electronics and machines,
4732180	4736340	you see a massive, shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall,
4736340	4739940	with silvery arms extending from either side.
4739940	4744020	A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below.
4744020	4745700	The machine begins whirring,
4745700	4747560	and you see a small metal sphere,
4747560	4749220	roughly one inch in diameter,
4749220	4752020	begin moving up through the tubing
4752020	4755940	into the larger armed version of itself.
4755940	4759020	As this happens, a vast circle opens up in the ceiling
4759060	4762260	and a disorienting amount of light and sound
4762260	4766540	pours into this room, revealing text painted on the back wall
4766540	4770420	that says the same thing you hear violently chanted
4770420	4775420	by an unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.
4776260	4777320	The scene changes again,
4777320	4779940	and you see Marvin Glass standing at his desk
4779940	4783340	in the grand room you recently stood in as Kevin,
4783340	4785300	alongside Rosemary.
4785300	4788460	Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes
4788740	4793740	closely inspecting it, tapping its lit red luminaire.
4793780	4797260	On his desk are two file folders splayed open
4797260	4800640	entitled Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna,
4800640	4802760	contention police officers.
4802760	4806020	You can see in Keith's file are various clippings
4806020	4807700	about the Beans family,
4807700	4811140	the tragic accidental deaths of William and Lena,
4811140	4814380	Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business
4814380	4815580	by Ferguson.
4815580	4818300	In Clark's file, there's a newspaper article
4819100	4822100	about the murderer who killed Clark Bishop's parents
4822100	4823580	and love.
4823580	4827920	There's a mugshot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile
4827920	4831900	behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.
4831900	4835020	And written in Sharpie underneath the mugshot,
4835020	4838300	it says in all caps, Karen.
4839460	4841100	In the mid morning sunlight,
4841100	4844060	in the wake of a funeral gone horribly awry,
4844060	4847000	Keith and Clark watched John's eyes,
4847000	4849360	which had rolled into the back of his head,
4849360	4850800	returned to normal.
4850800	4853880	John believed he'd developed the second sight
4853880	4856360	in his transition from John to Kevin,
4856360	4858400	or perhaps he'd had it all along.
4858400	4862460	He relayed everything he saw sans the planet juggernaut bit.
4862460	4865640	Keith recalled his brother's watch was in his safe
4865640	4867240	at Hotel Motel.
4867240	4869120	When Keith had put on the watch,
4869120	4872440	he felt like he was on some alternate plane
4872440	4874680	and knew he needed to take it off.
4874680	4877600	Clark asked Keith if it was as though the ground
4877600	4879120	were made of light.
4879120	4881560	No, it was more like in his mind,
4881560	4883680	he was seeing different stuff.
4883680	4887040	It was hard to decipher what was real and what wasn't.
4887040	4890480	John asked if Bean's pond meant anything to anyone.
4890480	4892080	When he thought about the objects,
4892080	4894080	those were the things he saw.
4894080	4896680	Clark made the connection that the letters John saw
4896680	4899200	flashing on the TV are the letters they give you
4899200	4902200	for the final puzzle in Wheel of Fortune.
4902200	4904280	When Clark woke up with the hole,
4904760	4905960	he had a bag with him.
4905960	4909200	In the bag was what he thought was his heart
4909200	4911520	and next to that was another bag
4911520	4914200	that had those letters in it.
4914200	4917680	John informed them they are not the first group of three
4917680	4920040	to try to combat this kind of stuff.
4920040	4922080	Before John, Clark, and Keith,
4922080	4924680	there was a group called K-Cell.
4924680	4928120	Kevin, John Lee Pettymore IV's adopted father
4928120	4930880	who he now inhabited the body of,
4930880	4933240	a man named Kyle, unknown,
4933240	4938040	and a woman called Karen, also known as Anne Love.
4938040	4941000	John told Clark he knew Anne Love
4941000	4943840	had been the one to kill his parents.
4943840	4944760	He didn't know why,
4944760	4947760	but Marvin Glass turned the group against itself
4947760	4950800	and Karen was the only one to get away.
4950800	4953520	Marvin made Kevin shoot Kyle.
4953520	4956080	He was looking for the metal sphere
4956080	4959520	and he apparently already had one in his possession.
4959520	4961840	Everyone wants these spheres.
4961840	4965480	John had one when he arrived at the Glass family compound.
4965480	4969080	Marvin Glass had one and he wanted to collect more
4969080	4970640	and learn how they work.
4970640	4972760	They realized the one John had
4972760	4977000	was now likely in the possession of Marvin Glass.
4977000	4980720	In John's vision, he had just seen one of those spheres,
4980720	4983120	but it was massive, gargantuan.
4983120	4986520	It had arms and a little tube coming out of the bottom
4986520	4990360	and up that tube he saw one of the small spheres go.
4990360	4992560	A huge light opened in the ceiling
4992560	4995160	like it was opening to allow this thing to come through
4995160	4999120	and the wall behind it read, Planet Juggernaut,
4999120	5000960	like the bedding stubs they found
5000960	5003760	in John Peter's house and storage unit.
5003760	5006400	Keith remembered that when he had the watch on,
5006400	5007920	it clouded his thoughts
5007920	5010360	and made him feel like he was going insane,
5010360	5012320	but one of the feelings he had
5012320	5015040	was wet dirt and grass on his fingers
5015040	5019360	and he saw a metal door slightly buried that read,
5019360	5023920	here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure,
5023920	5026560	saviors of the world.
5026560	5030480	Keith was positive somewhere along the beans bloodline
5030480	5032600	was something he didn't know.
5033560	5037200	Clark reminded Keith it was someone related to Keith
5037200	5040040	that came in and solved the town's Silas
5040040	5042920	and Mary Cole problem back in the day.
5042920	5045880	Keith didn't know where Cornelius beans fit in
5045880	5048200	with his family being scientists
5048200	5051840	and he didn't know where to find that metal door,
5051840	5053760	but he felt the door was real
5053760	5058560	and maybe there's something inside it they needed to find.
5058560	5060640	One of the last things Clark remembered
5060640	5062400	was being in Glass's office
5062400	5065800	and it sounded an awful lot like Glass hired Keith
5065800	5068720	to kill his own brother, Ferguson Beans.
5068720	5071080	Keith had even asked where the money was.
5071080	5072720	Since they're all working together again,
5072720	5075720	Keith didn't see the point in hiding it from them anymore.
5075720	5079280	Keith didn't know it was Marvin Glass hiring him to do it.
5079280	5081240	He was approached by his niece.
5081240	5084520	Keith explained that he'd hated his brother Fergie
5084520	5086160	since they were little boys.
5086160	5090120	So when this opportunity arose, he jumped at it.
5090120	5093000	The agents, Kennedy, McKinley and Harrison
5093000	5096720	had tasked them with quote neutralizing the threat
5096720	5099600	and they were supposed to call a phone number.
5099600	5102560	It'd been about 48 hours since they'd seen the agents
5102560	5105360	and the agents had given them a 48 hour deadline
5105360	5109200	so it'd be right about now that they'd be receiving a call
5109200	5112040	back at the contention police department.
5112040	5113840	Keith tried giving Drew a call
5113840	5115960	but it went straight to voicemail.
5115960	5117840	John pointed out the Glass family
5117840	5120160	might think Keith is still one of them
5120160	5122200	and they definitely think Kevin John
5122200	5123960	is still one of them as well.
5123960	5126240	And while Keith may have failed at his mission
5126240	5128280	of bringing Stan Manstein back,
5128280	5131040	he wouldn't have to infiltrate the Glass building.
5131040	5132840	He could return under the guise
5132880	5135720	of bringing in the guy who killed Stan Manstein,
5135720	5137000	that being Clark.
5137000	5140800	Then all three of them would be inside if things go awry.
5140800	5143240	The plan was to Chewbacca Clark
5143240	5147800	and use that farce to get close enough to kill Marvin Glass.
5147800	5150240	They decided to call the number the agents left them
5150240	5153000	on the way to the Glass family compound.
5154120	5156400	Suddenly, with an erupting shriek,
5156400	5158880	a massive creature materialized
5158880	5161200	on top of a nearby mausoleum.
5161200	5164520	It was a six and a half or seven foot tall creature
5164520	5167440	with long limbs wearing a black suit
5167440	5172040	over its gaunt frame covered in translucent skin.
5172040	5174240	This thing looked Clark Bishop in the eyes
5174240	5178720	and screeched, hello subject one, five, two, two, five,
5178720	5181920	one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight,
5181920	5185080	please add me the book, please.
5185080	5187160	The figure stared and stuck out
5187160	5189800	one of its overtly long arms.
5189840	5193600	Clark's gun was immediately trained on the mysterious figure.
5193600	5197760	John reached out a hand in greeting from 20 feet away.
5197760	5200280	The creature's arm was long, but not that long.
5200280	5203160	Keith ran behind the closest mausoleum and hid
5203160	5204880	as he pulled out his gun.
5204880	5209080	Clark felt an internal struggle, but managed to overcome it
5209080	5212280	and he continued to hold his gun steady at the creature.
5212280	5215600	Please, I would not like to ask again,
5215600	5217960	please give me the book.
5217960	5220520	Clark didn't know what book the creature was talking about.
5220520	5225520	The thing asked Kevin Lee John Pettimore the Thirth his name.
5225520	5229080	Kevin John responded in truth that his name was Kevin John
5229080	5230720	and that it was a long story.
5230720	5232960	He asked the creature its name.
5232960	5237160	The creature said its name was four, three, six, two, nine
5237160	5240280	and reiterated it was therefore the book.
5240280	5242760	Kevin Lee Pettimore the Thirth said again
5242760	5245800	that none of them knew which book it was talking about.
5245800	5250360	The creature claimed it could feel the book was nearby.
5250360	5252400	Clark looked around for Keith and noticed him
5252400	5255880	behind the mausoleum just as Keith took a shot at the creature
5255880	5257920	with his small powerful gun.
5257920	5261880	The bullet blasted through the creature's arm, but as it did,
5261880	5267040	the arm merely dissipated and began to slowly reform.
5267040	5270120	Before Keith could smell the smoke from his gunshot,
5270120	5272120	the creature was standing in front of him
5272160	5274360	with a hand on Keith's throat,
5274360	5278000	holding him up against the outside of the mausoleum.
5278000	5280720	It was as if they had all been standing still
5280720	5283720	as the creature walked casually towards him,
5283720	5287120	but it moved at an impossible speed.
5287120	5291120	It was probably like what the crowd saw them doing earlier
5291120	5293680	during Stan's speech at the funeral.
5293680	5296920	It asked Keith his name as it continued holding him
5296920	5301160	by the neck and Keith responded immediately with his name
5301160	5305000	without ever making the decision to do so.
5305000	5307520	He answered the creature's next questions too.
5307520	5308800	He was here for the funeral
5308800	5310920	and he was shooting because he was scared.
5310920	5313880	The thing slowly placed Keith back on the ground
5313880	5317040	and commanded that he not be scared.
5317040	5321000	And with that, Keith wasn't scared.
5321000	5324920	The creature told them it was only there for one thing
5324920	5328720	and it would leave as soon as it had the book.
5328720	5331440	John told Clark to give it the book.
5331440	5333320	Clark stuttered and stammered nervously
5333320	5335000	insisting he didn't know what book it wanted,
5335000	5336320	he did not have a book
5336320	5339280	and all he had were the clothes on his back and a gun.
5339280	5340880	The creature looked around frantically,
5340880	5343600	muttered to itself and began freaking out,
5343600	5347160	unable to understand why Clark didn't have the book.
5347160	5350120	Keith searched Ari's coffin for a book.
5350120	5351840	All he found was Ari's corpse
5351840	5353760	and all he achieved was upsetting
5353760	5355680	the already confused old lady
5355680	5357920	who had been left there on her own,
5357960	5360680	unable to leave the funeral quickly in her wheelchair.
5360680	5363040	Clark asked the creature to describe the book
5363040	5364480	but the creature only responded
5364480	5367720	that it was necessary for it to take the book from him
5367720	5371720	because Clark's time with the book had come to an end.
5371720	5374560	They did not want him using the book any further.
5374560	5376800	The creature insisted the book was there
5376800	5378560	and it needed to bring it back.
5378560	5380600	Keith started shooting the thing again,
5380600	5384200	it dissipated fully into smoke and ceased to be there.
5384200	5386520	Keith lost his shit and attacked Clark,
5386520	5388200	paranoid and afraid.
5388200	5389760	They eventually calmed him down
5389760	5392160	with smooth words and quick slaps.
5392160	5393120	When he snapped out of it,
5393120	5395080	Keith wondered aloud if that thing
5395080	5397560	reminded them of Marvin Glass.
5397560	5399880	Conversations circled back to the book.
5399880	5402280	Clark mentioned he had previously encountered
5402280	5404720	a strange book at Jim Cook's house.
5404720	5406960	Jim Cook was in the circle of knowledge
5406960	5410400	and Clark had found a particular leather bound book of his
5410400	5413160	that was quote, freaky deaky.
5413160	5415480	He also described this book as quote,
5415480	5419040	extremely grimoire-ish and it had the symbol
5419040	5421360	of the circle of knowledge on the front.
5421360	5423840	It was possible that this was the book
5423840	5427080	the creature had wanted but he hadn't taken it.
5427080	5429720	Keith asked if Clark opened this book.
5429720	5433400	Clark reiterated its freaky deaky nature.
5433400	5436600	He could only open it to the last page.
5436600	5439480	It was held shut by some unseen force.
5439480	5441680	Keith asked if he meant like magnets
5441680	5443200	to which Clark agreed.
5443200	5444840	There on the final page,
5444840	5447320	Clark had seen a drawing of a hooded figure
5447320	5449240	with light coming out of its mouth.
5449240	5452120	Written over and over and over on top of that
5452120	5454520	covering the whole page it read,
5454520	5458880	it is only through death that he may rise again.
5458880	5462360	Clark went on and explained it was some kind of sacred text
5462360	5464000	within the circle of knowledge.
5464000	5468760	Something to do with the revelation of the overseer.
5468760	5471920	Clark thought the overseer was maybe a good guy
5471920	5475400	who lays peace on the world or something like that.
5475400	5478320	John remembered when he saw old Clark,
5478320	5481120	he was wearing robes and he and dead Clark
5481120	5484440	disappeared into a bright light that came from his mouth.
5484440	5486040	Keith was confused about what he meant
5486040	5488080	by old Clark and dead Clark.
5488080	5490800	John unhelpfully clarified the Clark
5490800	5493400	that brought this Clark back to life.
5493400	5495240	Keith defended that this was the first
5495240	5497400	he was hearing about it and they seemed
5497440	5499800	to already know a lot more than he did.
5499800	5502560	All John saw was an older version of Clark show up
5502560	5504040	that light came out of his mouth
5504040	5506680	and then he reached into regular Clark
5506680	5508160	and they both disappeared.
5508160	5511040	That made total sense to Keith and they all agreed.
5511040	5514160	John suddenly remembered he'd arrived with Rosemary.
5514160	5516200	Looking around John didn't see Rosemary
5516200	5520200	but he did see two city police officers headed their way.
5520200	5522280	He warned the others they should skedaddle
5522280	5525240	but they all kept talking, failed to escape notice
5525240	5527160	and were told to freeze.
5527160	5529120	Clark turned still with gun in hand
5529120	5531360	and told the officers everything was fine,
5531360	5533000	that they were contention PD.
5533000	5535480	The city cops said they were responding
5535480	5537160	because shots were fired.
5537160	5539960	Keith said it was a 21 gun salute
5539960	5543440	and called the officers, quote, motherfuckers.
5543440	5546880	The city officers brought out notebooks to take statements.
5546880	5548440	Kevin John then approached,
5548440	5551760	pulled out a dirty dog grooming loyalty card
5551760	5554760	and suggested the officers not bother.
5554760	5557760	He was with Mr. Glass.
5557760	5561240	They whispered to one another and quickly apologized.
5561240	5563040	They started to ask Kevin to apologize
5563040	5564560	on their behalf to Mr. Glass
5564560	5566400	but quickly changed their minds
5566400	5568560	covering the names on their badges
5568560	5571640	and turning away before they hoofed it out of there.
5571640	5573760	John shared that the loyalty card
5573760	5576840	opened the door to the den of sin.
5576840	5578880	You know, the place where they were held
5578880	5581400	and forced into those cage fights.
5581400	5583480	He had seen a bunch of rowdy degenerates
5583480	5587120	use theirs to open an entrance in the ground of an alley.
5587120	5590200	There were still a bunch of Android bodies lying around
5590200	5594200	and no one had actually put the casket in the tomb.
5594200	5598400	Together, they picked up the coffin of Ari Manstein.
5598400	5601920	As they entered the open mausoleum, they heard a voice.
5601920	5604120	Clark recognized the voice the quickest
5604120	5608160	because it sounded so much like his own.
5608160	5611600	Little sparks of light could be seen in the darkness.
5611600	5614440	They seemed to be ignited by the steady chanting
5614440	5616760	which echoed throughout the room.
5616760	5619960	The flickering light illuminated a piece of parchment
5619960	5623800	held by an old Clark Bishop wearing a dark cloak
5623800	5626520	which covered almost all of his face.
5626520	5629800	A light began to emanate from his mouth.
5629800	5633160	The words he chanted ignited lifted from the page
5633160	5636640	in front of him and danced in a circle above them.
5636640	5639280	His lifted hands were cut open
5639280	5643200	and bled out onto the floor around them.
5643200	5645640	John and Clark instinctively dropped their support
5645640	5649600	of the coffin leaving Keith as the sole bearer of the wait.
5649600	5651560	The coffin hit the ground.
5651560	5654080	Ari's corpse plopped limply out
5654080	5658840	and onto the blood-soaked floor of the cold and dusty crypt.
5658840	5660800	The three of them were surrounded
5660800	5663640	by this magically sashaying fire.
5663640	5667320	It covered them in a warm, somewhat familiar light.
5667320	5669080	The light should have been comforting
5669080	5671720	but Clark was overwhelmed with the urge to leap
5671720	5673760	at the older version of himself.
5673760	5678520	He lunged, grabbed two handfuls of an empty cloak
5678520	5682960	and smashed his face against the back wall of the mausoleum.
5685000	5688280	The boys woke up with a shock through their bodies.
5688280	5693200	It was dark and cold and smelled sweet and savory.
5693200	5694640	There was a pool of blood.
5694640	5697400	In it rested the body of Ari Manstein
5697440	5699960	half hanging out of her broken coffin.
5699960	5702720	John Lee Kevin Moore was in black tactical gear.
5702720	5704600	Keith wore a tight orange polo
5704600	5707400	with big coral blue shorts and boat shoes.
5707400	5711040	Clark donned a vintage contention police uniform.
5711040	5714200	They felt pain on their chests, on their backs
5714200	5716560	and on the bottom of their left feet
5716560	5720160	and in the palm of their dominant hands.
5720160	5724160	Branded into each of these body parts were first names.
5724160	5727240	Their chests each read Marvin.
5728080	5729280	Their backs Drew.
5729280	5731720	Their left souls Maggie.
5731720	5735000	And their dominant palms Tildy.
5735000	5737120	Under the burned name of Maggie
5737120	5738960	on the bottom of Clark's left foot,
5738960	5743600	the skin had been eaten away in a very particular pattern.
5743600	5747720	A circle surrounded by six smaller circles.
5750120	5753760	Clark went mad and rushed John Lee Kevin Moore screaming.
5753760	5757400	John quickly drew his gun and shot Clark in the leg.
5757400	5759480	They all agreed on a few things.
5759480	5761360	They were scared and confused.
5761360	5764160	They didn't know what the names on their bodies meant
5764160	5766400	and they needed to see a doctor.
5766400	5769480	At the clinic, the officers billed the visit
5769480	5772040	to the first church of contention.
5772040	5773720	On the way to Jim Cook's house,
5773720	5776920	Keith called the number Agent Kennedy left behind.
5776920	5779200	He identified the officers involved,
5779200	5781920	disclosed the incursion had not been stopped
5781920	5784160	but that the incident had been covered up
5784160	5786800	and asked to speak to the FBI officers
5786800	5788760	instead of a recording.
5788760	5793120	In Jim's house, there were papers and binders everywhere.
5793120	5795440	Clark grabbed the book they had discussed,
5795440	5798080	the one with the circle of knowledge logo on it.
5798080	5800280	The only page they could open to
5800280	5803280	was marked with a girthy wooden bookmark.
5803280	5804680	The page read,
5804680	5808760	it is only through death that he may rise again.
5808760	5811320	Over and over and over behind the image
5811320	5814880	of a hooded figure with light shining from its mouth.
5814880	5817240	Clark then revealed an envelope
5817240	5819680	containing a letter from Jim Cook.
5819680	5821840	His letter's intent was to quote,
5821840	5824800	refute the revelation of the overseer,
5824800	5829280	which it called quote, the scratches of a broken man.
5829280	5831880	The letter ordered the immediate reassignment
5831880	5835800	of all members of the disposal unit.
5835800	5837840	The header of the letter read,
5837840	5841560	faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
5841560	5844080	The other interesting items Clark had found
5844080	5846800	included a ring, smooth and silver
5846800	5848920	with a little plateau on top.
5848920	5851600	Keith put the ring on and when slipped on his finger,
5851600	5855360	the ring glowed and revealed a familiar symbol,
5855360	5859680	an M made of four double helices.
5859680	5863080	Keith made the ring into a necklace with his shoelace
5863080	5864200	and wore it.
5864200	5866520	A drop of vodka hit Clark's nose.
5866520	5868640	It dripped from the ceiling above him.
5868640	5871280	The boys went upstairs but couldn't find a room
5871280	5874040	where the vodka drip would have come from.
5874040	5876320	Clark put his ear to the wall where that room
5876320	5879440	should have been and he heard static.
5879440	5881640	Unable to find the door to this hidden room,
5881640	5884760	Keith kicked a hole through the wall where the room would be.
5884760	5886520	Keith landed on the other side of the wall,
5886520	5890080	pushed through by his colleagues and covered in debris.
5890080	5893240	Inside, they found a small living room setup.
5893240	5896760	A chair with an end table faced a TV VCR unit
5896760	5900120	that set atop a pile of thick books.
5900120	5903480	A desk and a chair were pressed up against one wall
5903480	5907640	and a handle of vodka had tipped over on the floor nearby.
5907640	5909600	Its contents soaked the carpet
5909600	5912440	that barely covered a makeshift floor.
5912440	5914640	Clark noted a proper door in this room
5914640	5917000	that led into the upstairs hallway.
5917000	5919080	Static played on the television
5919080	5922400	and illuminated the titles of the tomes underneath,
5922400	5926080	textbooks on physics and quantum mechanics.
5926080	5930120	On the end table sat a small vial of clear liquid,
5930120	5933040	a scalpel and a box of tissues.
5933040	5936000	Keith twisted the top off the vial and wafted it
5936000	5939520	into his nose but smelled nothing and suffered no ill effects.
5939520	5942800	He slipped the vial into one of his spacious pockets.
5942800	5946880	The TV VCR unit had no input cable or antenna,
5946880	5951880	a tape labeled Bishops WOF was discovered inside the unit.
5952920	5956680	It contained an episode of Wheel of Fortune,
5956680	5958520	a special couples episode
5958520	5961120	on which Clark's parents were contestants.
5961120	5962480	They had just been married
5962480	5965120	and were hoping to win money for their honeymoon.
5965120	5968400	On the desk were three folders and an envelope.
5968400	5971440	The first folder contained a large stack of papers
5971440	5974120	regarding Operation Stapler.
5974120	5977400	The double helix M logo appeared on the second page
5977400	5980320	above the word myriad.
5980320	5981920	Keith flipped to the index
5981920	5983840	and gleaned that it was the work of someone
5983840	5987640	who had been tasked with rewriting an existing program
5987640	5990360	put in place to create androids.
5990360	5993880	This respect operation aimed to cut costs
5993880	5996320	and sell to private companies.
5996320	6000240	John Googled myriad and the screen briefly wobbled
6000240	6004160	before returning to normal with no clear results.
6004160	6008520	The second folder was entitled Operation Hole Puncher.
6008520	6011120	The title page included the name and symbol
6011120	6013160	of the circle of knowledge.
6013160	6016360	This folder contained a list of companies,
6016360	6021360	mostly nonprofits, think tanks, charities and universities.
6021600	6026120	The third folder referred to Operation Three Ring Binder
6026120	6030440	and was empty except for a dirty dog grooming key fob
6030440	6032200	tucked into the pocket.
6032200	6034040	Clark's parents did well on the show,
6034040	6036400	eventually making it to the bonus round.
6036400	6038280	As the final puzzle was displayed,
6038280	6041720	Clark's mom turned to his dad and said,
6041720	6044240	we were already given the best letters.
6044240	6046920	They solved the final puzzle and won the prize,
6046920	6048280	a honeymoon.
6048280	6052320	Clark noticed the tape in the VCR showed a great deal
6052320	6055840	of wear like it had been played many times.
6055840	6058320	John opened the envelope and found the symbol
6058320	6060280	of the circle of knowledge at the top.
6060280	6064440	It said, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
6064440	6067640	Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness
6067640	6068920	that I write to you.
6068920	6071840	I fear a change is coming.
6071840	6075680	I cannot be certain, but I suspect there's one among us
6075680	6078200	scheming with treacherous intent.
6078200	6080760	I have recently grown a tail.
6080760	6084320	He is not particularly skilled in going unnoticed.
6084320	6087640	He is an odd little man with round glasses
6087640	6091080	on a fat face with no hair and no chin.
6091080	6095480	He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose
6095480	6097080	on Marvin Glass.
6097080	6101840	Stay alert, step carefully, we are being watched.
6101840	6104040	Signed, Jim Cook.
6104040	6106440	Several individual letters in this letter
6106440	6110920	were over or underlined and the men quickly found the name
6110920	6114800	Maggie Cook was coded into the message.
6114800	6118200	They inferred Jim thought his daughter might be the traitor
6118200	6120640	inside the circle of knowledge.
6120640	6123400	The officers discussed the order of Jim's letters,
6123400	6126440	the connection between Chief Cook and Harold Dorsey,
6126440	6129680	the resurrection of Maggie and the lurking horror
6129680	6133520	she'd revealed to Clark through the Xenonematode.
6133520	6135760	The men didn't come to any clear conclusions,
6135760	6139040	but agreed Marvin Glass was the most addressable threat
6139040	6140120	they had.
6140160	6143040	With that, they resolved to storm the gates
6143040	6147320	of the Glass compound using Clark as a false hostage.
6147320	6149920	On the way, John mentioned the Glass company card
6149920	6154600	for Large Eddie's Gun Emporium in Kevin's pocket.
6154600	6157400	Large Eddie himself kicked open the door to the back
6157400	6159920	where he kept all the cool guns.
6159920	6162960	The renegade officers equipped themselves with a sampler
6162960	6166920	of grenades and firearms and drove to the secret entrance
6166920	6170760	of the Den of Sin in the heart of the city.
6170760	6173840	There, as John pulled out the dirty dog grooming
6173840	6178200	loyalty key fob, the great gave way beneath the men's feet
6178200	6181640	and they plummeted into darkness below.
6181640	6183960	As they fell downward into darkness,
6183960	6188040	the former cops slowed to a feeling of weightlessness
6188040	6191280	before being abruptly confronted with a bright light,
6191280	6193840	huge words in a spray painted font
6193840	6196960	and a deafening voiceover saying the same,
6196960	6200320	welcome to the scrap pit.
6200320	6203880	A video screen showed them an enormous Glass arena
6203880	6207360	with hundreds of screaming spectators
6207360	6209960	and a shadowy form began to emerge,
6209960	6212520	but before this person could even hit the lights
6212520	6216960	of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupted into view,
6216960	6220600	gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame.
6220600	6223400	The screen faded to black and they found themselves
6223920	6228760	in an oily obsidian room with an entrance to the scrap pit
6228760	6233160	and a separate door guarded by two fishmen armed with scythes.
6233160	6235960	On seeing the officers, the guards moved
6235960	6237880	to let them through this door.
6237880	6241800	Keith and John marched Clark through and into an elevator
6241800	6245000	as if he were their prisoner.
6245000	6246880	The elevator door opened
6246880	6250080	and they saw five malnourished children
6250120	6254480	along with Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, passed out on the floor,
6254480	6259280	attended to by grandmotherly old women in identical clothes.
6259280	6262200	These women poured a liquid into the mouths
6262200	6264480	of the unconscious bodies.
6264480	6268240	Keith and John both saw a ghostly black dog
6268240	6272320	and red lion diving in and out of the bodies.
6272320	6274320	One of the women entered the elevator
6274320	6277840	with our heroes inside and it continued moving.
6277840	6280280	She introduced herself as Ursula
6280280	6285280	and explained her role in preparing the sacrifices.
6285680	6290160	The boys exited the elevator into a massive foggy room
6290160	6292600	that contained a network of catwalks
6292600	6295600	over dark green murky water.
6295600	6300280	The fishiness was pungent, rusty moss covered chains,
6300280	6303400	dangled large hooks between the catwalks
6303560	6307880	and some of these hooks suspended prisoners above the water.
6307880	6310760	Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad
6310760	6313480	was one of these unlucky folks.
6313480	6315800	When he saw them, he freaked out
6315800	6317680	at their return from the grave.
6317680	6322080	This entire chamber was seemingly patrolled by one fish man
6322080	6324840	and Francis Beanes could be heard questioning
6324840	6329440	Cathy and George Piston deeper into the cavernous space.
6329440	6333000	Francis asked Cathy Piston about silver spheres
6333000	6337760	as well as the residue and outbreak in contention
6337760	6341680	while dipping a clearly distressed George Piston
6341680	6344880	slowly into the murky water.
6344880	6347160	Kevin John got Francis's attention
6347160	6348960	and told her that they'd brought Clark
6348960	6350280	as a prisoner to torture
6350280	6352800	and that Marvin wanted to see her right then.
6352800	6354960	She was not convinced to leave immediately
6354960	6357320	so Keith resorted to his backup plan.
6357320	6360280	He tried to whack her with his heavy metal hand.
6360320	6363560	He missed and Francis threw him into the water.
6363560	6364720	She was about to run for it
6364720	6367240	but Kevin John persuaded her to stay
6367240	6370400	for more of her beloved torturing.
6370400	6372120	At that moment, it occurred to Keith
6372120	6374960	he might be swimming with the giant creature
6374960	6378240	that ate his little fish friend, Peter Dieter.
6378240	6382480	Keith freaked out and began to climb up George Piston.
6382480	6387080	Erupting up out of the water just under Keith's boat shoes,
6387080	6391760	the massive creature swallowed both Keith and George
6391760	6396400	and re-submerged into the vast murky pool.
6396400	6399080	Clark, John, and Francis watched
6399080	6402480	as the water began to calm in front of them.
6402480	6406000	Francis Beans, unaffected by the apparent death
6406000	6409640	of her uncle, prepared to hang Clark up for some torturing
6409640	6412880	which prompted a failed sneak attack from John.
6412880	6415440	Francis countered by pushing the hook
6415480	6418200	directly through John's shoulder.
6418200	6420720	Clark kicked her right over the edge into the water
6420720	6423880	and she clanged her head on the railing as she went.
6423880	6426280	The soon to be corpse of Francis Beans
6426280	6428960	floated face down in the water.
6428960	6430560	Keith Bigna and George Piston
6430560	6434000	were inside an enormous creature.
6434000	6436320	They tried to claw and push their way out
6436320	6440480	as the disgusting, burning ooze inside the beast
6440480	6443560	slowly digested them.
6443560	6446760	Keith used George Piston as a human shield
6446760	6450280	and blasted out of this fish monster's side
6450280	6451760	with a frag grenade.
6452800	6455800	While gazing down at the floating body of Francis Beans,
6455800	6459000	Clark and John saw a flash of light deep under the water
6459000	6462480	followed by bubbles and a gasping Keith of Igna,
6462480	6464440	skin covered in burns.
6464440	6466640	They pulled him out and Keith broke the news
6466640	6470560	of George's death to Kathy in a typically kind
6470560	6474400	and sensitive manner, sparing no details.
6474400	6477440	The boys decided to leave Francis Beans to her fate
6477440	6480600	and continued to question the hanging Kathy Piston
6480600	6483480	about why she was supplying people
6483480	6485120	to the Circle of Knowledge.
6485120	6486840	Clark admitted he already knew why
6486840	6489520	and told Kathy he was working with Maggie.
6489520	6492360	Kathy agreed to help the team take down Marvin Glass
6492360	6495600	if they just explained where Leo was.
6495600	6498880	They told her he disappeared from this plane of existence
6498880	6501040	and they blamed it on Marvin Glass.
6501040	6504560	Even though she was awful human trafficking scum,
6504560	6508520	her crack shot ability was a necessary addition.
6508520	6511480	John and Keith pulled down the hanging Doug Jacobs
6511480	6513760	in the body of Agent Chad.
6513760	6517520	Clark discreetly asked Kathy her opinion on Maggie.
6517520	6520480	She said Jim's daughter was rougher around the edges
6520480	6523700	than her dad, but Kathy had been too busy at the hospital
6523700	6525840	to pay too close attention.
6525840	6528400	Clark told her the truth about Leo's last hours
6528400	6531560	and about how he had killed Julie.
6531560	6535360	On the metal catwalk above the hazy greenish water stood
6535360	6537840	Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV
6537840	6540640	in the body of his father, John Lee Pettymore III,
6540640	6543780	AKA Kevin, Keith Vigna, Kathy Piston,
6543780	6546960	and Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.
6546960	6551160	Their goal, leave this enormous dank prison alive.
6551160	6555280	The only exit they could see, a closed elevator door.
6555280	6558360	The issue, fishmen in brown jumpsuits
6558360	6562040	with mouths full of human teeth and scythes.
6562040	6566120	And those human teeth mouths, they were singing.
6577320	6580040	This song's purpose was revealed
6580040	6583040	when the catwalk was dragged down into the water
6583040	6586040	by a massive version of the fishmen,
6586040	6590160	an enormous creature with a huge pus-leaking wound
6590160	6593840	in its side and a hunger in its eyes.
6593840	6596460	The monster dug into Keith's chest
6596460	6598720	and ripped its claws through his skin,
6598720	6601000	revealing metal insides.
6601000	6604420	The pain was too much for Keith Vigna to bear,
6604420	6608080	and he passed out on the metal walkway.
6608080	6611160	Keith, in the darkness you see a woman
6611160	6613540	wearing old-timey clothing.
6613540	6616340	She looks very normal, except for the hole
6616340	6618160	right in the middle of her head.
6618160	6621120	Regardless of how she turns to look, either way,
6621120	6624440	you can see right through the middle of her head,
6624440	6626320	and she is walking toward you.
6626320	6630200	As she walks, her clothes change multiple times,
6630200	6633540	as if she's in an unnatural fashion show
6633540	6637000	that's moving forward in time, decade by decade.
6637000	6640560	She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground,
6640560	6645440	you see the house of Chief Maggie Cook go up in flames.
6645440	6647400	You saw this happen in the front yard,
6647400	6651400	but this time, right now, you see it from the backyard.
6651400	6654240	The fire spreads and explodes toward you,
6654240	6656820	over you, through you, and you turn around
6656820	6660840	to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond,
6660840	6664460	and immediately, the water evaporates.
6664460	6668400	Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish
6668400	6671640	flopping their final flops, you see your brother,
6671640	6675460	Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground,
6675460	6678720	wearing a cowboy hat and spurs,
6678720	6681960	and the watch your father, William, gave him.
6681960	6684920	You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there.
6684920	6688680	You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals,
6688680	6691520	until the B. Mitchell comes walking up
6691520	6693520	out of the water toward you,
6693520	6696800	and darkness fills your vision once more.
6698400	6700880	Outside of Keith's unconscious dreams,
6700880	6703620	the fight continued, the water was still murky,
6703620	6706120	the air was still heavy, the fishman's teeth
6706120	6709040	were still unsettling, and the elevator door
6709040	6711520	had still yet to open.
6711520	6714160	Bullets whizzed around the enormous prison.
6714160	6716280	Flash bangs erupted and flashed.
6716280	6718900	Doug Jacobs, in the body of Agent Trent Chad,
6718900	6722840	was decapitated by the scythe of a fishy humanoid.
6722840	6725860	Kathy Piston likely saved all of their lives
6725860	6729220	with her nonstop firearms proficiency.
6729220	6732980	Grenades destroyed entire sections of the catwalk,
6732980	6735180	and persuaded the enormous fish monster
6735180	6738220	to dive back down below the surface.
6738220	6741380	One of the human-sized bipedal amphibians
6741380	6746100	lodged its scythe into the skull of Kathy Piston.
6746100	6749600	John was swallowed whole by the big daddy fish monster,
6749600	6752940	but he swam out through the hole Keith had previously made.
6753020	6755940	He saw another creature make an escape as well,
6755940	6760400	a little toy-sized human body with the head of a fish.
6760400	6764220	However, an unseen force suddenly grabbed John
6764220	6767880	and dragged his body down to the bottom of the tank,
6767880	6771860	up against the glass of this gargantuan aquarium.
6771860	6775180	John was forced to stare directly
6775180	6779740	into the unblinking eyes of Marvin Glass,
6779780	6783460	and as John Lee Kevinmore the thirst's lungs
6783460	6788140	filled with water, Marvin Glass smiled.
6790620	6794180	Clark stood on a wet, partially destroyed catwalk
6794180	6797780	with Keith in his arms with nowhere to escape to
6797780	6801300	across from the last standing fishman.
6801300	6804020	The human amphibian swung wide,
6804020	6807220	and Clark stabbed it to death with its own scythe.
6807380	6810860	He saw bubbles in the water before the two halves
6810860	6815340	of the enormous creature, as well as bits of George Piston,
6815340	6817220	floated to the surface.
6817220	6820580	Clark broke down in tears as a god
6820580	6822760	who had failed his followers.
6823860	6825700	The elevator arrived.
6825700	6828660	Clark dragged the unconscious body of Keith Vigna
6828660	6831220	halfway in to block the elevator door
6831220	6834500	before going to see if he could find John's corpse.
6834500	6835740	He did not.
6835740	6837740	In a desperate search for closure,
6837740	6840300	Clark stripped down to his tighty-whities
6840300	6843340	and took the scythe down into the water with him,
6843340	6846460	diving into the disgusting murk.
6846460	6850220	At the bottom and side of this massive aquarium,
6850220	6853420	he found John Lee Kevinmore the thirst's body
6853420	6858140	pressed against the glass by an unseen influence.
6858140	6860540	Looking for the source of the force,
6860540	6863460	he saw Marvin Glass standing in his office
6863460	6865500	on the other side of this glass.
6865500	6868760	Marvin shook a picture at Rosemary.
6868760	6872460	Clark couldn't find a pulse and John's body wouldn't budge.
6872460	6874460	Then he remembered Keith's small
6874460	6876400	but incredibly powerful gun,
6876400	6879500	swam back up, fetched it from Keith's shorts,
6879500	6882660	and still, in his soaking wet tighty-whities,
6882660	6886780	Clark fired into the aquarium wall over and over
6886780	6890260	until it broke, sending a tidal wave
6890260	6894640	of murky green wet into Marvin's office.
6894640	6898880	However, Marvin calmly lifted himself and Rosemary
6898880	6903880	up atop the water and made direct eye contact with Clark.
6904440	6906340	With the slightest gesture,
6906340	6909920	Marvin then moved the impotently enraged Clark
6909920	6912960	down from the catwalk of the adjacent room.
6912960	6917960	Helpless and paralyzed, Clark was placed in front of Glass,
6918080	6922080	compelled to stand motionless on top of the water.
6922080	6925840	Keith woke up in darkness,
6925840	6928600	jammed halfway into an elevator door.
6928600	6930940	Thankfully, his little friend Peter Dieter was there
6930940	6935400	to heal his shredded chest with its weird saliva.
6935400	6938780	Keith looked down and saw the scene in Marvin's office.
6938780	6941640	Marvin looked back but Keith managed to scurry away.
6941640	6945600	Unfortunately, Peter was dragged away by Marvin.
6945600	6948520	The elevator doors closed and took Keith to a lab
6948560	6952240	full of computers, math, and electrical shit
6952240	6955580	with a sort of interrogation window into a side room
6955580	6960080	that was completely painted in blood and viscera.
6960080	6963360	The tall, awkward, mad scientist was working
6963360	6964880	here in the main lab.
6964880	6967880	Keith broke the news of Peter Dieter's likely death,
6967880	6969720	which bummed her out.
6969720	6971440	He explained the scene he saw
6971440	6975280	in Marvin's aquarium water-filled office from the elevator.
6975280	6978480	Poking around this lab, Keith saw a bunch of VHS tapes
6978480	6981520	labeled with names, and he asked to see one.
6981520	6985120	The scientists obliged, and they watched a malnourished
6985120	6989160	child in the bloody room stand behind a desk
6989160	6992260	with a small metal sphere on it.
6992260	6994160	The child picked up the sphere.
6994160	6996880	The sphere promptly ripped out his spine
6996880	7000360	and entered his body, which then began slamming itself
7000360	7002240	repeatedly against the wall,
7002240	7005560	much to the amusement of the scientist.
7005560	7007960	She was very surprised to hear that Keith had seen
7008440	7010000	someone handling a sphere.
7010000	7011600	While they walked down to Marvin's office,
7011600	7014240	he told her about the black Nike bag.
7014240	7017120	When they opened the large, strange obsidian doors
7017120	7021080	to Glass's office, water erupted out and into the hallway,
7021080	7023080	sweeping the two of them away,
7023080	7027240	though their bodies were held by Marvin's unnatural ability.
7027240	7030200	Without effort, they moved through the water,
7030200	7033560	into the office, and up to the little meeting
7033560	7037080	between Marvin, Rosemary, Peter, and Clark.
7037080	7041480	Glass held a Polaroid photo and demanded explanation.
7041480	7044560	It depicted Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna,
7044560	7048840	alongside Kevin, in a world where everything was made
7048840	7053840	out of darkness except the ground, which was made of light.
7055560	7057780	Clark was rendered unable to move
7057780	7061080	by Marvin Glass's unnatural grasp.
7061080	7065100	In his catatonic state, he witnessed an odd discussion
7065100	7067240	between Marvin and Rosemary.
7067240	7069440	Marvin showed Rosemary the picture
7069440	7072540	and asserted that something was wrong.
7072540	7074380	You gotta send me over there.
7074380	7077340	I don't know how, but we gotta figure out something.
7077340	7079020	Suddenly, Marvin perked up.
7079020	7082260	He looked up past the former confines of his office
7082260	7085620	where the elevator door beeped, unable to close
7085620	7089180	due to its sensors and Keith Vigna's body.
7089180	7090980	Marvin held out his hand.
7091020	7095540	He seemed confused when a small creature landed in his palm.
7095540	7098900	Peter Deeter, with the softball-sized fish head
7098900	7101620	on a human body the size of a Barbie doll,
7101620	7105800	chatted and chatted with Glass, who glared at Rosemary
7105800	7108980	while alluding that her job title was in jeopardy
7108980	7111700	and could be available soon.
7111700	7114900	Marvin's face shifted like he smelled something
7114900	7118540	or experienced some other unknown sensation.
7118540	7120740	He reached out again and out of the water
7121340	7125380	stood Keith Vigna and the white lab coat-clad scientist,
7125380	7129300	maniacal hair now dripping, and her eyes lit up
7129300	7132660	with excitement to see Peter Deeter still intact.
7132660	7135100	Keith and the tiny fish-man creature
7135100	7139260	greeted each other warmly before Marvin shut him down
7139260	7141380	with the flick of a hand.
7141380	7145520	Peter's large fish eyes stared blankly past his new friend
7145520	7148420	as Clark's normal human eyes blinked back
7148460	7151300	to his unbelievable reality.
7151300	7154300	Marvin Glass asked the two former police officers
7154300	7157620	about the strange picture and they felt unnaturally
7157620	7161020	compelled to answer to the best of their abilities.
7161020	7164200	The picture came from the camera sitting on Marvin's desk.
7164200	7166260	It shows things that aren't there.
7166260	7168840	They thought the pictures were from a different dimension
7168840	7170260	or the past or something.
7170260	7173500	Marvin asked how many pictures they took.
7173500	7175160	There was the one with the torches
7175160	7176880	in the old-timey clothing,
7176880	7180760	one with John Peters and oily black stocks,
7180760	7183700	and another of a guy with tribal tattoos
7183700	7186260	kneeling before a cowboy with his hand up
7186260	7188240	to hide his face from the camera.
7188240	7190680	Marvin asked Clark to confirm the part
7190680	7192720	about the man with tribal tattoos
7192720	7196000	running down both arms to his fingertips.
7196000	7198080	And Rosemary dove for the gun.
7198080	7200160	As she grabbed it, Marvin reached down
7200160	7203100	and flung the sphere at her from off the desk.
7203100	7206700	Multiple shiny limbs extended from the small sphere
7206700	7208900	slammed into the desk for leverage
7208900	7213780	and slung its silver round frame at its target, Rosemary.
7213780	7216780	One of its appendages sliced into the soft tissue
7216780	7218780	on the back of Rosemary's neck.
7218780	7220780	Another snapped her head forward.
7220780	7223200	A third metal tendril reached in,
7223200	7225860	gripped the top of Rosemary's spine
7225860	7229820	and ripped her entire spinal cord out of her body
7229820	7232140	in one swift motion.
7232140	7234580	This ball promptly forced itself
7234580	7239420	into the now-vacant spinal column of this human being.
7239420	7243700	The new Rosemary had a crazed look in her eyes.
7243700	7247200	She blew her nose into her hand,
7247200	7252200	slammed the mucus into the empty chamber of this odd gun,
7252300	7255700	and without aiming, squeezed the trigger.
7255700	7257660	An almost blinding flash of light
7257660	7260100	illuminated the entirety of Marvin's
7260100	7262500	enormous, flooded office.
7262500	7265460	And then, as if she had never been,
7265460	7267480	the body of Rosemary was gone.
7267480	7268820	Aah!
7268820	7271820	Marvin Glass roared in anger.
7271820	7273860	And where Rosemary just stood,
7273860	7277100	they could now see a pool of viscous black sludge
7277100	7279820	enveloped a placid body.
7279820	7284020	Her limbs seemed to peacefully fold into the ooze,
7284020	7287380	becoming one with the sentient mass of goop
7287380	7290140	that then slid across the water.
7290140	7292780	Marvin reached out a hand, grabbed the goo,
7292780	7296560	and hurled it downward into the murky water below.
7296560	7299360	And a strange noise filled the air,
7299360	7301980	like when a tube TV is turned on,
7301980	7305060	a noise that could almost be felt in your head
7305060	7306840	or in the back of your throat.
7308600	7310780	Marvin pressed the two petrified men
7310780	7313220	on their knowledge of this black substance.
7313220	7314940	How many times had they seen it?
7314940	7316060	Had it taken people?
7316060	7317700	Did they know how to contain it?
7317700	7320280	Was it running rampant through contention?
7320280	7324480	Next, he questioned them about the small silver spheres.
7324480	7327660	Keith explained that the contention PD had a bag,
7327660	7330220	and when they put the silver ball in the bag,
7330220	7331260	it disappeared.
7331260	7333300	Marvin was curious about this.
7333300	7335900	Would anything in the bag disappear?
7335900	7338120	Keith admitted they never tried anything
7338120	7340020	other than the metal spheres.
7340020	7342780	Marvin commented on the plural Keith used
7343140	7346940	asked how many silver balls they'd come into contact with.
7346940	7349580	Keith said they'd only made the one disappear,
7349580	7352420	but another was found embedded in the skull
7352420	7356460	of a severed head they'd pulled out of some storage units,
7356460	7359820	adding that one of the contention PD
7359820	7361760	touched the silver ball.
7361760	7363860	Marvin assumed this was their coworker
7363860	7366780	who was recently gunned down and ripped apart.
7366780	7369400	Keith explained that John Lee Pettymore IV,
7369400	7371980	the man who held the sphere previously,
7371980	7374180	was inside Kevin's body.
7374180	7377820	Marvin's eyes widened, as did Clark's.
7377820	7379660	Clark thought Marvin had something to do
7379660	7380940	with the body switching.
7380940	7383140	Skeptical of all of this information,
7383140	7385820	Marvin extended a hand downward
7385820	7389920	and pulled the body of John Lee Kevinmore the third up
7389920	7391640	from out of the water.
7391640	7394140	With one hand holding Kevin's body,
7394140	7398380	he used the other to twist open Kevin's head
7398380	7400220	like an avocado.
7400220	7404300	Sitting inside his head like the pit of an avocado
7404300	7406820	was a small silver sphere.
7406820	7410640	Marvin ripped Kevin's body in half right down the middle.
7410640	7414500	Where a spinal cord should have been, there was nothing.
7416100	7418940	Since Clark and Keith were now gonna be a part
7418940	7421460	of some heavy entertainment,
7421460	7424280	Marvin offered to answer a few questions.
7424280	7427660	Clark immediately asked what the silver balls are.
7427660	7429900	Marvin has been doing research on them
7430420	7432060	and has come to very few conclusions,
7432060	7434900	though they are not from this realm.
7434900	7438100	Marvin was working to secure their destruction.
7438100	7440920	Keith asked where he found the balls.
7440920	7443300	One had been brought to him a long time ago
7443300	7445540	by two men he was seeking out.
7445540	7447740	They, along with one other person,
7447740	7449980	had stolen something from him.
7449980	7452660	Clark pointed out that when Marvin threw the sphere
7452660	7456100	at Rosemary, he was aware it did something.
7456100	7458100	Marvin confirmed he knew the spheres
7458100	7460980	and intended to enter the person they touched,
7460980	7462800	but Rosemary still shot the gun
7462800	7464820	after being taken over by the sphere.
7464820	7466260	Did it not work?
7466260	7469040	Marvin admitted he didn't suspect the entity
7469040	7471540	would do anything other than try to kill itself
7471540	7473280	as it normally did.
7473280	7475420	Keith asked if Marvin knew anyone
7475420	7478620	with the previously described tribal tattoos.
7478620	7482140	That was one of his sons, Jermaine Glass.
7482140	7485640	Keith asked why Marvin wanted to destroy the spheres.
7485640	7488280	Glass saw the balls as competition.
7488280	7490520	If he couldn't figure out how to utilize them,
7490520	7492920	he wanted them eradicated.
7492920	7495960	Glass was in search of as much power as possible
7495960	7500640	in an attempt to obtain control over this domain.
7500640	7504240	Finally, Clark asked what Marvin was.
7504240	7506280	Glass said he was not one of them,
7506280	7510500	rather one of many who were in control, who ran things,
7510500	7513920	but he had become bored, left the bureaucracy,
7513920	7517600	and had been battling Myriad ever since.
7517600	7519400	Then Marvin snapped his fingers
7519400	7522160	and Keith and Clark were unconscious.
7522160	7524760	They awoke in a room with walls covered
7524760	7528600	and every piece of weaponry and gadget imaginable.
7528600	7531020	A cage like the ones they'd been trapped in
7531020	7534920	above the Den of Sin appeared at a darkened window.
7534920	7537200	Oz Mayhem Wolf climbed out,
7537200	7539640	said it seemed they were gonna fight together,
7539640	7543040	and excitedly grabbed his preferred combat gear.
7543040	7546640	A timer began counting down, water began filling the room,
7546640	7549280	and a circle opened above them.
7549280	7552680	A disorienting amount of light and sound hit
7552680	7555880	as an unseen crowd chanted the name
7555880	7559880	of this group's opponent, Planet Juggernaut.
7564960	7569700	In a dark room lit by various electronics and machines,
7569700	7574700	there sat a massive shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall,
7574940	7578740	with silvery arms extending from either side.
7578740	7583020	A tube connected this gargantuan ball to a machine below.
7583020	7586260	The machine began whirring and a small metal sphere,
7586260	7588100	roughly one inch in diameter,
7588100	7590620	began moving up through the tubing
7590620	7594220	into the larger armed version of itself.
7594220	7598740	As this happened, John Lee Pettymore IV felt
7599900	7602580	alive again.
7602580	7605540	John felt his consciousness extend itself
7605540	7607140	throughout his new body,
7607140	7610940	this colossal monument to destruction.
7610940	7613940	A vast circle opened up in the ceiling above,
7613940	7616780	and a disorienting amount of light and sound
7616780	7618680	poured into this dark room,
7618680	7621460	which revealed text painted on the back wall
7621460	7624820	that read the same thing heard violently chanted
7624820	7628820	by the unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.
7629820	7634060	Here's the way, here's the way, here's the way.
7634060	7639060	John gave his new hands a tentative punch together
7639220	7641020	and dug in his foot.
7643380	7647140	Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and Oz Mayhem-Wolf
7647140	7649700	walked up the stairs and into the lights
7649700	7651620	and sounds of the arena.
7651620	7655300	This colossal room was circular and funneled downward,
7655300	7657180	at least 10 stories.
7657220	7661700	Thousands of seats surrounded a massive covered cage,
7661700	7665940	50 yards across, with a bubble-looking rounded top on it,
7665940	7669460	entirely made of a crystal-clear material.
7669460	7672260	Aggressively loud dubstep blared,
7672260	7676140	strobe lights made the entire experience otherworldly,
7676140	7678820	as green and red and blue lasers
7678820	7680900	swung wildly around the room,
7680900	7682820	like a futuristic Las Vegas
7682820	7685860	filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's films
7685860	7688300	if they were tarred and feathered,
7688300	7691020	but the tar was replaced by Red Bull
7691020	7694060	and the feathers replaced by cocaine.
7694060	7696900	An enormous logo in the center of the arena floor
7696900	7700700	read in all caps, The Scrap Pit.
7700700	7703060	And all around the Scrap Pit,
7703060	7706220	in a massive circle were the repeated words,
7706220	7708600	Planet Juggernaut.
7708600	7712700	A gigantic circular jumbotron hung above the bubble,
7712740	7716780	blinked a countdown timer and flashed the words,
7716780	7721780	Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends versus Planet Juggernaut.
7722380	7726260	The exceptional voices of Mick and Nick Nichols
7726260	7728700	echoed through the pandemonium
7728700	7731220	and announced an evening of bloodsport
7731220	7734060	the audience would never forget.
7735820	7739620	The floor opened and Planet Juggernaut slowly rose
7739660	7743340	into the Scrap Pit to an explosion of roars
7743340	7745140	from the eager audience.
7745140	7749740	The sight of the gigantic shiny metal sphere 20 feet wide
7749740	7754200	with two metallic arms extending from either side
7754200	7756820	knocked something loose in Clark.
7756820	7760140	He lunged straight at Oz Mayhem Wolf in a frenzy
7760140	7761940	and tried to rip his head off.
7761940	7765980	A confused Oz Wolf ran away from his antagonistic teammate
7765980	7769560	but clumsily tripped over and fell to the ground.
7770440	7772640	Planet Juggernaut sent lasers blazing from its eyes
7772640	7774980	at Keith Vigna who jumped out of the way
7774980	7777720	with his cool jumping boots.
7777720	7782720	Mid air Keith shot Planet Juggernaut with a saw launcher
7782720	7784880	and embedded a circular saw
7784880	7787920	in the giant robot balls midsection.
7787920	7791240	Planet Juggernaut propelled itself into the air
7791240	7795660	and landed on Oz Wolf as it slammed Clark down
7795660	7798320	with its powerful metal hand.
7798360	7800880	Keith Spidermanned up the Scrap Pit wall
7800880	7804520	with suction gloves and froze Planet Juggernaut's propeller
7804520	7807120	with a nitro thrower.
7807120	7811320	A crushed Oz crawled out from beneath the burnished behemoth
7811320	7815520	which sat eerily still as it clearly charged up something
7815520	7817920	somehow even more sinister.
7817920	7821020	Keith tried to release his suction cups from the dome
7821020	7822320	but his feet were stuck.
7822320	7824660	He looked into the apotent audience
7824660	7828020	and saw a short young woman and tall old man
7828660	7831780	wearing suits, ties and ill fitting windbreakers.
7831780	7834900	He recognized agents Kennedy and McKinley
7834900	7837700	as they made their way through the crowd.
7837700	7840900	Clark launched himself up onto Planet Juggernaut
7840900	7843900	which rapidly spun its exterior shell
7843900	7846580	while hovering just above the battleground
7846580	7849740	in order to hit the pit rolling at a quick clip
7849740	7851900	toward its slow foes.
7851900	7855500	This squashed Clark but absolutely obliterated
7855500	7860020	Oz Mayhem Wolf into a pile of organs and teeth
7860020	7863580	which sat in a dark red paste.
7863580	7868580	As Nick and McNiggles discussed the mayhem scene and lost,
7868980	7872340	a small hoover poked out of Planet Juggernaut
7872340	7877340	to suck up and collect the loose teeth of Oz Wolf.
7877820	7880900	An artificial wind began to pick up
7880900	7883060	in the corner of the Scrap Pit
7883060	7884900	and headed toward Clark Bishop
7885180	7887620	who fired his high powered sniper rifle
7887620	7889420	into the giant ball robot
7889420	7892060	while thinking about his friend and coworker,
7892060	7894100	John Lee Pennymore the fourth.
7894100	7898020	Planet Juggernaut grabbed Clark with his extendo arms
7898020	7899820	and Mickey Mouse gloves.
7899820	7904140	It pulled Clark close and attempted to speak.
7904140	7904980	Clark.
7906980	7907820	It's me.
7909340	7910180	It's John.
7911860	7913860	I don't wanna fight you.
7915900	7918060	We've gotta find a way outta here
7918060	7920060	and into Marvin Glass's booth.
7921540	7923780	Can we kill him together?
7923780	7927020	Nick and McNiggles cut to a video segment
7927020	7930100	incorrectly called Fighting Pro Tips
7930100	7933860	from Alfred and Jermaine Glass.
7933860	7938540	The jumbotron showed a dark room with a single light on.
7938540	7940580	A young man in the shadows of the room
7940580	7942300	huddled in the field position
7942900	7945060	and stammered about a gun,
7945060	7946620	someone disappearing,
7946620	7948420	it coming after him
7948420	7951580	and a missing girl before the feed was cut off
7951580	7955340	and the attention turned back to inside the Scrap Pit.
7955340	7958540	In the clutches of the speaking Planet Juggernaut,
7958540	7960420	Clark's mind snapped
7960420	7963700	and he pleaded for help from Planet Jonernaut
7963700	7966460	who was focused on a young bald fit man
7966460	7970620	with sunken intense eyes and a black t-shirt and jeans.
7970620	7975060	Agent Billy Harrison was headed toward Marvin Glass's box.
7975060	7978460	Planet Jonernaut threw himself with all its might
7978460	7981060	into the dome above the Scrap Pit.
7981060	7982980	The crystal clear material,
7982980	7985380	considered indestructible by all
7985380	7987980	who had fought inside its bubble previously,
7987980	7989020	shattered.
7989020	7993180	Its pieces floated down into the pit like a firework.
7993180	7995460	The crowd scattered for their lives,
7995460	7998460	perhaps to add fuel to the confusion fire
7998460	7999980	to aid in an escape,
8000020	8003140	Keith Vigna sprayed his nitro thrower
8003140	8005300	into the panicking mob.
8005300	8008820	Suddenly, a rushing cascade of murky water
8008820	8010740	containing different kinds of fish
8010740	8012620	and a few humanoid figures
8012620	8015780	blasted out from Marvin Glass's theater box.
8015780	8018460	In the deluge were four flushed folks,
8018460	8021340	Agents Kennedy, McKinley and Billy Harrison
8021340	8024100	as well as a body wearing a tuxedo
8024100	8028300	with gaunt skin stretched across long bones.
8028300	8029980	Marvin Glass.
8029980	8034020	All four were washed into the middle of the Scrap Pit.
8034020	8036460	Clark unloaded three rounds into Marvin
8036460	8038540	and triggered a deafening roar.
8038540	8040260	Ah!
8040260	8044580	Planet Jonernaut requested that Clark jump up on him
8044580	8047180	to avoid the ever rising tide.
8047180	8050820	Keith, using his nitro thrower against the bad guy
8050820	8052300	instead of the audience,
8052300	8055700	completely encased the floating body of Marvin Glass
8055700	8058380	in a sort of dry ice cube.
8058380	8060820	Clark, from atop Planet Jonernaut,
8060820	8063740	yelled to Keith the wacky and wondrous news
8063740	8066340	that Planet Juggernaut was John.
8066340	8069900	Planet Jonernaut sent one extendo arm toward Keith
8069900	8073500	as the other reached for a breach in the dome above.
8073500	8075820	Keith threw down his riot shield,
8075820	8080180	rode it like a surfboard toward Jonernaut's extended hand
8080180	8082340	and shot a saw through the middle
8082340	8084420	of the newly formed ice cube
8084420	8089020	and directly into the frozen Marvin Glass trapped inside.
8089020	8092020	The Scrap Pit began to shake violently
8092020	8095180	and Jonernaut successfully pulled Keith and Clark
8095180	8098140	up through the dome as lava moved up
8098140	8101620	through the cracking and bubbling Scrap Pit.
8101620	8105260	Marvin Glass, sliced by the saw and still frozen
8105260	8107740	in this strange chemical compound,
8107740	8112740	melted into the lava pit below and the scene changed.
8114860	8118660	There was a road lined on either side by trees
8118660	8120940	that reached over, blending together,
8120940	8123500	creating an autumnal canopy.
8123500	8127340	A rabbit recklessly raced across the patchy pavement,
8127340	8130220	leaving behind a trail of blood thick enough
8130220	8132740	to assume the animal's fate.
8132740	8136340	A boxy black sedan drove furiously down the road,
8136340	8139780	trailed closely by a four-wheeler.
8139780	8142180	They took a right down the gravel road,
8142220	8146860	blowing past a sign that read, The Contention Woods,
8146860	8150860	and text at the bottom of the screen came up.
8152140	8154700	25 years earlier.
8184860	8185940	What's up, everybody?
8185940	8188660	It's Zach, still Zach, so much Zach,
8188660	8190780	and we are now halfway through
8190780	8193100	this stupidly overwhelming undertaking
8193100	8196300	of a full recap of season one.
8196300	8198940	It's been really fun and I'm so glad,
8198940	8202940	I'm so glad, no, it's been a bit of a fucking nightmare,
8202940	8205460	but it's halfway over, yay!
8205460	8208500	Thankfully, we've had an absolute shitload of fun
8208500	8210740	recording some bonus content for everyone,
8210740	8213460	which will be on this main feed soon.
8213500	8215900	More on what exactly that entails
8215900	8218580	at the end of this little epilogue.
8218580	8221860	And later this month, patrons will see a new episode
8221860	8223460	drop in that exclusive feed,
8223460	8226420	wherein I run Joe, Luke, and Thomas
8226420	8229220	through a space adventure in a space game
8229220	8231520	of space roll for shoes.
8231520	8234780	That session was seriously some of the most lighthearted,
8234780	8236900	enjoyable role play I've ever had the pleasure
8236900	8238140	to take privilege in.
8238140	8239140	Ha ha ha ha!
8239980	8243700	All right, and for those of you who slosh around
8243700	8246100	in the Den of Sin, be on the lookout
8246100	8248060	for a live stream this weekend.
8248060	8250820	We'll post the time and date on our Twitter
8250820	8254000	and Instagram at PretendingPod.
8254000	8258100	We're playing a game called, oh fuck, I can't remember,
8258100	8261920	Patrick, something about Patrick, Inside Patrick.
8261920	8264620	We're all, we're all, no.
8264620	8267500	As for the next and third part of this here
8267500	8270980	season one recap project, I need your help
8270980	8273940	and I'm willing to send you clothes in return.
8273940	8276260	There's a link in the show notes and on Twitter,
8276260	8279120	Fuck Jack Dorsey and Facebook, Fuck Mark Zuckerberg,
8279120	8281140	to a Google Doc we can all share.
8281140	8283180	It'll have the transcript for this episode
8283180	8285700	which covered episodes 24 through 46
8285700	8287420	as well as the previous recap
8287420	8289260	covering episodes one through 23.
8289260	8293780	Now, if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs
8293780	8296200	recapping an episode of this show,
8296200	8299740	you will be entered to win a PTBP t-shirt.
8299740	8303640	Now, if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs
8303640	8306480	recapping three or more episodes,
8306480	8311220	you will be entered to win one of five PTBP t-shirts.
8311220	8313720	So if only five people write up three or more episodes,
8313720	8315040	boom, you got a shirt.
8315040	8318560	And finally, if you really go heels to Betsy on this,
8318560	8321680	if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs
8321680	8324720	recapping five or more episodes,
8324760	8328400	I will guarantee you a PTBP t-shirt.
8328400	8332240	And leave your handle or email address commented in there
8332240	8334860	so we know who wrote what and how to contact you
8334860	8338560	in case we get to ship you a shirt like Dylan B did.
8338560	8342360	Dylan B wrote recaps for six episodes
8342360	8344960	and a shirt is on its way.
8344960	8348860	Also, an enormous shout out to Here Be Tigers
8348860	8353360	from the Discord who so far has written four recaps
8353360	8356280	that were absolutely excellent.
8356280	8358900	For those of you looking into joining this project
8358900	8362100	and earning a shirt, those recaps by Here Be Tigers
8362100	8364600	are what you should model your work after.
8364600	8368960	Succinct but thorough, ugh, bless you, Here Be Tigers.
8368960	8371180	So please, join us, earn a shirt,
8371180	8374200	and help us finish the remaining two recap episodes
8374200	8377600	so we can deliver you the final arc of season one
8377600	8379160	of Pretending to Be People.
8379160	8381720	I am so very excited.
8381720	8384680	Now, the next episode you see on this main feed
8384680	8386080	will be a bonus.
8386080	8389280	Unfortunately, Luke wasn't able to join us
8389280	8391040	because he got COVID.
8391040	8393200	Wear a fucking mask.
8393200	8395480	Thankfully, he is feeling much better now
8395480	8399400	and will be joining us for the end of this bonus scenario,
8399400	8402360	which is a game of Call of Cthulhu
8402360	8406160	with guest keeper Scott Dorward,
8406160	8409780	an RPG writer and editor whose name might sound familiar
8409780	8413340	because he co-authored the Pope Cthulhu campaign,
8413340	8415960	Two-Headed Serpent, as well as a collection
8415960	8420060	of six scenarios for Call of Cthulhu named Nameless Horrors.
8420060	8424100	He also wrote an excellent scenario called Hell in Texas
8424100	8426740	that's in Stygian Fox's Cthulhu modern book
8426740	8428740	called The Things We Leave Behind,
8428740	8432620	and so, so, so much other amazing material.
8432620	8435480	Scott is also an established podcaster,
8435480	8439020	and I have personally listened to every episode
8439020	8441860	of The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,
8441860	8444980	a podcast about Call of Cthulhu, horror films,
8444980	8447260	and horror gaming in general.
8447260	8450080	Scott is a magnificent game master
8450080	8454340	with the voice of an angel in the mind of an elder god,
8454340	8459340	and we had a disgusting, revolting, marvelous time
8459380	8461860	playing a scenario he wrote and published
8461860	8464980	set in a Hooverville in the Great Depression
8464980	8467900	entitled Bleak Prospect.
8467900	8471020	Thank you, thank you all so much
8471020	8473500	for your continued support.
8473500	8474620	Times are hard.
8474620	8475840	Check in on your friends.
8475840	8477900	Be honest, be vulnerable.
8477900	8479820	Admit it when you need help.
8479820	8481800	I'm finally doing that myself.
8481800	8484700	For years, I've said everyone should be in therapy,
8484700	8487620	all while not seeing a therapist.
8487620	8490200	I even got my degree in behavioral science.
8490200	8491700	I understood the benefits.
8491700	8495180	I understood it would help me, but I was scared.
8495180	8496020	Well, fuck that.
8496020	8498660	I'm still scared, but I'm not gonna let that stop me.
8498660	8501940	So I'm starting therapy, and I'm consciously working
8501940	8503660	to become who I want to be.
8505780	8506920	I hope you're all doing well.
8506920	8507980	This was all very serious.
8507980	8511660	Quick, picture Tom Hanks in a courtroom.
8511660	8514540	He's the judge, but he's wearing a mesh crop top,
8514540	8517020	and you're pretty sure his nipples are pierced
8517020	8519860	and connected by a nerd's rope.
8519860	8520700	Okay, bye.
8520700	8522460	Hot dog.
8551200	8559200	Am I the only one trying to pull over?
8559200	8567700	How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
8567700	8573700	This love I know.
8573700	8581700	This love I know.
8581700	8585700	Fly to fly to the stream.
