0	2840	Welcome, my sour-creamy children.
2840	5840	It's your yogurt craftsman, Wolf the Dog,
5840	10640	and I'm here to leave out all the cream until it becomes art.
10640	16320	Then I shall venture to the farmer's market to sell my wares by the barrel.
16320	21960	I'm about to flood this farmer's market with that thick, nasty artisanal cream.
21960	28240	I'm warming up all the sour milk live from 694.2 PTBP,
28240	34840	the only yogurt creamery and, uh, radio station, I think.
34840	39320	Speaking of that good cream, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.
39320	44160	This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Van Gogh's ear in Alberta, Canada,
44160	47800	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,
47800	53680	which is one of the ways you can be chosen to write up a Howlin' with Wolf for this old wolf to howl.
53680	55160	He writes,
55160	58080	No ooze is good ooze.
58080	60320	All cops are bastards.
60320	63120	And all dogs go to heaven.
63120	64520	Things fell apart.
64520	66200	The sinner couldn't hold.
66200	69840	The Stygian tide is loosed and everywhere.
69840	73280	The ceremony of innocence is overcome.
73280	75320	And what eldritch beast?
75320	77920	It's our come round at last.
77920	81240	Slouches toward contention to be born?
81280	86600	Shout out to Irish Chris and Elena the Good Witch of the Midwest.
86600	89960	Season one has been squamously good.
89960	91840	We can't wait for season two.
91840	95560	Thanks for all the creepin' terror, PTB crew.
95560	97520	Damn Van Gogh's ear.
97520	103440	I didn't know ears knew such fancy words and could compose poems or whatever.
103440	105880	That's awesome for you, I bet.
105880	109480	One time, I wrote a poem for a past lover.
109520	115040	It was mainly just the letter E, but they got what I was puttin' down.
115040	120560	It, uh, it was sexy talk is what I was puttin' down.
120560	125120	And I just wanna let y'all know, not all dogs get into heaven.
125120	128880	Only a very small percentage of them actually do.
128880	130440	Weird, right?
130440	134000	If you wanna write up somethin' like Van Gogh's ear here,
134000	136720	then listen to me very carefully.
136760	142320	Write a five-star review for this five-star show on Apple Podcasts.
142320	148480	Then y'all should go and tag at Pretendin' Pod on all them damn social media things.
148480	152880	Then come on down to the subreddit and Discord too, why don't ya?
152880	154880	Two more cool things.
154880	160720	First, my producer released a trailer for season one of Pretending to be People.
160720	164360	If I had a YouTube, I'd definitely look at it.
164360	171080	So what I need y'all to do is to look at it and then share it with all your internet buddies.
171080	180440	Next up, the 24th bonus episode over on Patreon is comin' out sooner than my cream starts curdlin' on a hot summer's day.
180440	183800	After y'all caught up with the creature crew,
183800	190880	join them PTBP friends Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Central Time in the Den of Sin.
190920	195240	For the conclusion of the mission in Moja.
195240	199040	Apparently that's a place where spooky things can happen,
199040	202480	but y'all gotta check the Patreon to find that out.
202480	205320	Are there links for all that sloppin' more?
205320	206640	Why, yes.
206640	207840	Where are they?
207840	209600	They're in the show notes.
209600	213520	Just click on the thingy that shows you them damn show notes.
213520	215600	Do it for Wolfie, my babies.
215600	218720	I'm makin' puppy dog eyes at ya.
218720	221960	And now I'm doin' this for y'all.
221960	224800	It's the gosh dang news.
224800	229520	Last time, I gave over the power, relinquished the duty,
229520	233480	forwent the honor of presenting the news.
233480	236720	But this time, you know what's goin' on.
236720	244280	Planet Juggernaut just crushed all of the Giganticumbic Hyrthpicithis' hopes and dreams with the fastball.
244280	249400	Took out the horde of incoming goo-drenched snatchy skeletons,
249400	254360	and turned it into a curveball-gotcha-tongue situation.
254360	259480	You're sweet and sourly mistaken if you're lookin' for Dragon in 2.
259480	264120	This is Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
274280	278280	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline,
278280	282280	leavin' my mind at your altar,
282280	286280	crossin' the double line, doin' it every time.
286280	292280	Tell me What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
294280	300280	What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
304280	312280	Wow, wow, wow, come on down, everybody!
312280	317280	It's Nick Meckles and I'm here with my brother, Nick Meckles!
317280	320280	Is that the energy we wanna start with?
320280	323280	Nick Meckles! Nick Meckles!
323280	325280	Yeah, sorry Justin, are you not amped up enough?
325280	327280	Oh, do we need to amp you up?
327280	328280	I need to be amped up.
328280	329280	Okay, let's get the energy going.
329280	332280	Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.
332280	336280	Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.
336280	337280	It's Nick Meckles time!
337280	342280	Oh, everybody! It's Nick Goddamn Meckles!
347280	351280	Round three and we're at the top of this, motherfucker.
351280	353280	What do you think about that, Nick Meckles?
353280	357280	I'm just surprised we're still standing here at our little,
357280	360280	I guess, are we at like a little television desk?
360280	363280	No, we're standing on either side of Keith Vigna,
363280	366280	who's crying deeply into the ground and his hands.
366280	368280	I've got one microphone in his face,
368280	370280	you've got the other microphone in his face,
370280	373280	which means that we have four microphones between the two of us.
373280	374280	That's quite amazing.
374280	376280	I love that we found these extra microphones
376280	378280	in this extra dimensional plane.
378280	380280	Well, they're everywhere when we're around
380280	382280	and we're gonna go right to the business!
382280	383280	Oh my God!
383280	385280	Let's look up at that.
385280	387280	Do you see the big, gigantic,
387280	389280	Gigant Umbropithecus right there,
389280	391280	the big guy who's being swung around,
391280	393280	Planet Juggernaut's got his tongue swinging around
393280	396280	like Luke Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back.
396280	398280	Do you see that?
398280	400280	I do see that.
400280	403280	Well, that guy is right up there!
403280	406280	The Gigant Umbropithecus reaches down
406280	413280	and takes another massive swipe across the land at the Liturgy.
413280	415280	Am I using that right? At the...
415280	417280	Yeah!
417280	424280	And so another chunk of this crooning group of chanters.
424280	427280	Zach, it would be really asinine to stop you right now
427280	430280	just for a minor definition quibble.
430280	434280	That would be insane.
434280	436280	I liked it. I liked learning.
436280	437280	Love it.
437280	440280	I like learning, and this is a illuminated land,
440280	443280	the Liturgy that I'm learning about.
443280	446280	About half of them straight up get consumed
446280	450280	into the forearm of this enormous beast
450280	453280	as it swipes across at this group.
453280	455280	And I was thinking about it, and I thought,
455280	459280	you know, we already rolled for, gosh, so many people.
459280	462280	We rolled for the Old West people.
462280	464280	We rolled for Jack Perlman.
464280	465280	Oh!
465280	467280	We rolled for Drew Andrews.
467280	469280	We rolled for Councilwoman Carrie Pages.
469280	471280	We rolled for Harry Clinker, Everett Pace,
471280	473280	Mildred Mitchell, Gary Daley, Jimmy Sanders,
473280	474280	Professor Horace Green.
474280	477280	We rolled for a lot of people as well as a lot of pets.
477280	480280	And to put you guys through that again,
480280	483280	I thought might be super duper fun.
483280	484280	Let's go.
488280	491280	So basically what we're gonna do is,
491280	495280	as this enormous towering beast that's just oozing,
495280	498280	forming and reforming its tongue,
498280	500280	hanging out with Planet Juggernaut
500280	503280	at the end of this black ooze that it's held onto.
503280	505280	It swings around him.
505280	508280	And because Planet Juggernaut has this thing's tongue,
508280	511280	we're gonna take a negative 20%.
511280	513280	This thing will take a negative 20%.
513280	517280	So this time, we're gonna roll for some more NPCs,
517280	519280	whether or not they live
519280	521280	or whether or not they will be consumed,
521280	526280	and they each have a good 30% chance of non-existence,
526280	531280	which means a 70% chance of survival, which is big.
531280	532280	So I will start.
532280	534280	I will go ahead and roll the first one
534280	538280	because we have just enough NPCs left for everyone
538280	540280	to have their own to roll for.
540280	545280	So I'm gonna start with Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now.
545280	549280	So you see this very tall, very buff woman
549280	552280	dressed like she's in the Old West still.
552280	555280	She's got just insanely strong thighs.
555280	557280	And when you look at the thighs, you think to yourself-
557280	559280	Watermelon busting hips.
559280	560280	Yep.
560280	561280	100%.
561280	565280	And shout out to M from Michigan for giving us this NPC-
565280	566280	To maybe murder.
566280	568280	$10 level on Patreon.
568280	570280	You can write up an NPC.
570280	571280	They will kill.
571280	572280	Yeah.
572280	575280	So if it is a 30 or under-
575280	576280	They die?
576280	577280	Yep.
577280	578280	95.
578280	579280	Safe.
579280	580280	Sweet life.
580280	581280	Next up is Thomas.
581280	582280	Thomas, I need you to roll
582280	586280	as we see the janitor of the First Church of Contention.
586280	589280	He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet.
589280	590280	Casey Kristoff.
590280	594280	His beard gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt
594280	596280	all over his cutoff shorts,
596280	598280	his outfit of choice for the past 30 years,
598280	601280	and he is missing a hand.
601280	604280	Spilling out all over his jorts
604280	608280	is a disgusting and amazing description.
608280	611280	And thankful for that description.
611280	613280	I am, and you are, and we are,
613280	616280	to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City,
616280	619280	who wrote up Casey Kristoff for us.
619280	620280	I wear some of his underwear.
620280	621280	To 100?
621280	622280	Yep.
622280	625280	Thomas, 30 or under, and he gone.
625280	626280	42.
626280	628280	Oh, that's a liver.
628280	629280	That's a liver.
629280	630280	That's a liver.
630280	634280	Luke, I need you to roll for a man of average height.
634280	637280	He has dirty overalls and boots,
637280	640280	a trucker cap with long, oily hair
640280	642280	flowing out the bottom of it,
642280	644280	and a lip packed with chew,
644280	646280	the scent of booze on his breath,
646280	649280	oil-stained hands, and a ripped flannel.
649280	652280	You got your $3 back from Terence Liquor.
652280	653280	Yep.
653280	654280	Now let's see.
654280	656280	I hope he dies.
658280	659280	Oh!
659280	661280	He's dead as fuck.
661280	663280	It's a 29.
663280	666280	It's a 29 as Terence Liquor looks up
666280	669280	at the very end of his life.
669280	671280	Literally, in my imagination,
671280	673280	the ooze must have taken him
673280	676280	as he was still just laying in the yard of Randy Yanks,
676280	680280	and so he has almost no time to come to his senses here
680280	684280	in this dark, luminous, landed plane of existence.
684280	686280	He had a bad day.
688280	691280	And he can't even remember what his voice sounds like
691280	695280	as he dissipates into the arm ooze
695280	697280	of this gigantic umbropithecus.
697280	700280	Probably kind of ambiguously southern.
700280	701280	Yeah.
701280	702280	If I had to guess.
702280	704280	That's a good guess, yeah.
704280	707280	Shout-out to B. Crever for that lost life.
707280	709280	Thank you for making Terence Liquor.
709280	711280	What a joy it was to have him in the game.
711280	713280	And next we have Joe.
713280	716280	I would like you to roll for an attractive woman
716280	717280	from the city,
717280	721280	and she has a large tortoiseshell glasses,
721280	724280	a full-sleeve tattoo of a robed figure
724280	727280	holding a ball of light on her left arm,
727280	730280	and she always wears blood-red lipstick.
730280	732280	That's right, it's Clara Blankenship.
732280	733280	We met her in the tunnels,
733280	735280	and she told us about a dream she'd had.
735280	736280	Yes.
736280	739280	Yes, and shout-out to Annie B.
740280	743280	Annie B, your character lives.
743280	744280	Oh!
744280	745280	It's a 45.
745280	747280	Oh, my God, that was close.
747280	749280	Annie, she is okay.
752280	755280	And Justin, this one's a new one.
755280	757280	Shout-out to Sarah from Philadelphia.
757280	760280	Just go ahead and roll over 30
760280	763280	for Archie and Taco.
763280	766280	Archie and Taco, two dogs
766280	768280	to help fight the black ooze
768280	770280	with the Contention Creek Critter Coalition.
770280	772280	Archie is a white lab mix,
772280	775280	and Taco is a Shetland sheepdog.
775280	776280	And then in parentheses,
776280	778280	Sarah from Philadelphia has written,
778280	781280	Just please don't kill my pups.
782280	783280	Oh!
783280	784280	Hey!
784280	785280	Hey, Liv.
785280	786280	56.
786280	787280	Wait, could you see that?
787280	788280	I did, yes.
788280	789280	Oh, nice.
789280	790280	Yeah, that worked.
790280	791280	We sawed him.
791280	792280	We sawed him.
792280	793280	Sawed him nice.
793280	794280	Oh, wow, that was a really,
794280	797280	this thing is clearly off its balance.
797280	798280	It does not know.
798280	800280	Yeah, it just did, it airballed.
800280	801280	Yeah.
801280	802280	I mean, it was rough.
802280	804280	It took out the one we wanted.
804280	805280	Tear of Slicker.
805280	807280	Yeah, we did miss one, yep.
807280	809280	Literally, the people who are chanting
809280	813280	have noticed Tear of Slicker's lack of involvement
813280	815280	in the chant, and they just kind of pushed him
815280	818280	a little bit more towards the edge of the crowd.
818280	819280	And even that, I think,
819280	821280	I feel like the gigantombropithecus
821280	823280	is maybe a little bit distracted
823280	825280	by the tongue Skywalker situation.
825280	826280	100%.
826280	827280	So maybe just like it whiffed,
827280	830280	and just unfortunately a huge drop of its ooze
830280	832280	just smothered Tear of Slicker,
832280	834280	like would pacify.
835280	836280	That's perfect.
836280	839280	And if it weren't for that Planet Juggernaut movement
839280	841280	with the negative 20%,
841280	844280	I think we would have lost a few more.
844280	847280	Almost all of them, I think.
847280	850280	We hit a 42 and a 46.
850280	853280	Now he's just bragging about how fucking cool
853280	854280	Planet Juggernaut is.
854280	857280	No, I'm just bragging about how lucky our roles were.
858280	861280	Immediately, Rosemary, M-A-R-Y,
861280	864280	removes itself from Rosemary.
864280	865280	Can we roll to see if she got hit
865280	866280	by the Gigantombropithecus?
866280	867280	Oh yeah, sure, I'll just roll.
867280	868280	Don't look.
869280	870280	Yeah, she's fine.
874280	876280	I did roll a 37, though.
876280	881280	Rose M-A-R-Y pulls its remaining metal tendrils
881280	886280	up out of the face and back of the neck of Rosemary.
886280	888280	Upon seeing John Ball...
888280	890280	Filling her hole with the world.
890280	891280	That's right.
891280	894280	Upon seeing this competition,
894280	898280	she's going to give it a bit more oomph
898280	901280	so she removes all of her tendrils
901280	902280	from the back of Rosemary.
902280	905280	She is now a free ball up in the air.
905280	908280	And she's free balling, thank you.
908280	912280	And so she plugs all of her tendrils
912280	914280	down into the hole, the portal,
914280	915280	that she is trying to open
915280	918280	in an attempt to focus more of her energy
918280	921280	to combat the situation that John Ball
921280	923280	is making happen.
923280	924280	However, with this,
924280	927280	she is leaving herself open and defenseless.
927280	930280	So I am not going to roll a dodge roll
930280	931280	for her this round,
931280	933280	and any combat directed at her
933280	935280	will be unopposed
935280	939280	as she is going to attempt to bring
939280	941280	some sort of creature from the other side,
941280	944280	which we can already kind of see
944280	946280	through this weird haze, this veil,
946280	949280	and just barely, we can all make out
949280	952280	a dark, dank, cold room.
952280	955280	And inside is a familiar skeletal creature
955280	957280	with skin so thin,
957280	960280	her bones protrude into view.
960280	962280	Her nail beds are empty.
962280	965280	Bruises and lesions cover her body.
965280	968280	But even through the hideous transformation,
968280	972280	you recognize Mildred's granddaughter.
972280	976280	And with pure hatred in her eyes,
976280	980280	Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.
980280	985280	Tildy B. Mitchell roars.
985280	986280	I cut you off.
986280	988280	We couldn't hear you.
988280	989280	I just saw the face.
989280	991280	The sort of resonance begins to emanate
991280	995280	from the manipulating activator robot Y,
995280	998280	and you all hear or feel a soft voice around you.
998280	1002280	Oh, is that what it stands for?
1002280	1005280	Silas Cole, the fool who brought me
1005280	1007280	into his existence
1007280	1010280	and then left me out of all his plans,
1010280	1013280	even though the pitiful man couldn't figure out
1013280	1015280	how many beans make five.
1015280	1018280	I found him here, where I left him,
1018280	1021280	and he finally told me where he kept her,
1021280	1024280	experimented on her, and then abandoned her
1024280	1026280	for well over a century.
1026280	1032280	You, uncaring meat vessels, disgust me.
1032280	1034280	Uh, lady, it sounds like you just have
1034280	1036280	a problem with Silas.
1036280	1038280	That's Keith. Go get him.
1040280	1044280	And John Paul says this to M-A-R-Y,
1044280	1047280	and the camera does a whip pan over to Keith,
1047280	1052280	who is in between two very, very interested announcers
1052280	1055280	who have microphones shoved into his face,
1055280	1059280	but they suddenly are joined by another figure
1059280	1063280	who is a tall, gaunt, translucently skinned figure
1063280	1067280	in a large, black suit and black tie,
1067280	1071280	and it just sort of appears in front of this Keith Vigna,
1071280	1073280	who is on his knees,
1073280	1076280	crying into the luminous land below.
1076280	1078280	These myriad dudes have a lot of personality.
1078280	1080280	I bet they'll make for a really good interview.
1080280	1084280	And this thing crouches down
1084280	1087280	and reaches out its two hands,
1087280	1089280	each with a McFlurry.
1089280	1091280	Yes.
1091280	1094280	M&Ms in one, Oreo in the other.
1094280	1096280	That's beautiful.
1098280	1099280	Oh.
1099280	1102280	Keith Ashley beans!
1102280	1106280	I believe you requested these!
1106280	1108280	Keith takes both the McFlurries, looks down in them,
1108280	1111280	and sees the Oreo one, takes a little bite,
1111280	1114280	and then he looks around for Don,
1114280	1116280	because he needs to deliver this M&M McFlurry.
1116280	1118280	Okay.
1119280	1124280	When you look around, you find Don as...
1124280	1127280	You find him in a little different state
1127280	1129280	than you left him?
1129280	1134280	He has been subsumed by one of the Johns.
1134280	1138280	One of these balls has made him into a leg
1138280	1141280	of a sort of three-part operation,
1141280	1143280	Don being one leg,
1143280	1145280	John being another leg,
1145280	1148280	and a ball floating atop in between them.
1148280	1152280	But also, Don seems to, from this perspective,
1152280	1156280	have full control over what he says and does.
1156280	1159280	Am I attached at the scruff of the neck or something?
1159280	1160280	Yeah, essentially.
1160280	1165280	Cool. And I'm dangling around next to your nephew
1165280	1168280	and below your nephew's ball.
1168280	1172280	Your nephew, but the body of your brother.
1172280	1173280	Oh, right, yeah.
1173280	1174280	Next to your brother, nephew,
1174280	1176280	which isn't the first time somebody's
1176280	1178280	had to be called that in the Pettymore family.
1178280	1181280	It's an old-fashioned Pettymore get-together.
1181280	1185280	So, Keith, you do see now where Don is.
1185280	1186280	That's right.
1186280	1188280	That drawing that you just made there, that's right.
1188280	1191280	And we'll post that on the social media
1191280	1192280	for everyone to see.
1192280	1197280	That should be our official episode post 111.
1197280	1200280	How far away is that from me?
1200280	1202280	The AT-ST of John Don?
1202280	1203280	Yes.
1203280	1207280	Don John AT-ST is a one-round John.
1207280	1209280	I take the McFlurries from...
1209280	1211280	You're welcome.
1211280	1212280	I don't know where you came from.
1212280	1214280	It seems like maybe you just kind of blipped
1214280	1216280	into existence here.
1216280	1218280	Can you take me over to them?
1218280	1220280	Okay.
1220280	1222280	And I, for like three or four seconds,
1222280	1225280	just silently look at him, looking him up and down,
1225280	1229280	and I just hop on his back, like piggyback.
1229280	1234280	You don't blip out of existence, you do move there,
1234280	1236280	and you move there at an absurd rate
1236280	1239280	that you haven't felt really since this thing
1239280	1243280	clearly moved from on top of one of the mausoleums
1243280	1247280	in the city cemetery to you to put its hand
1247280	1249280	directly around your neck.
1249280	1252280	That was the last time that you felt this movement,
1252280	1254280	but this time you're a part of it.
1254280	1257280	And then you're standing in front of this AT-ST
1257280	1260280	that is already you guys practicing.
1260280	1265280	Left, right, left, right.
1265280	1267280	Keith hops off the creature's back
1267280	1271280	and is like, hey, and he holds up the M&M McFlurry
1271280	1272280	and looks at Don.
1272280	1273280	What the hell is this?
1273280	1275280	I try to slap it out of his hand.
1275280	1278280	You try to slap the McFlurry out of his hand?
1278280	1280280	This ain't the time for a McFlurry boy.
1280280	1282280	Oh, hold on, Uncle John.
1282280	1286280	Uh, Don.
1286280	1289280	Hey, Avigna, if you're just passing out McFlurries
1289280	1290280	and you don't want one,
1290280	1292280	I'll take that McFlurry right now.
1292280	1296280	He switches his hand over like a foot
1296280	1298280	and offers it to you.
1298280	1301280	John hanging there, he doesn't reach out for it.
1301280	1303280	He just extends his neck a little bit
1303280	1308280	and starts slurping from the McFlurry straw.
1308280	1310280	I like to imagine I was slapping,
1310280	1312280	but my hands are barely moving.
1312280	1315280	I'm just dangling back and forth
1316280	1318280	You're swinging your torso
1318280	1319280	and the noodle arms are going with it.
1319280	1321280	I'm like, come on, boy, bring it closer.
1321280	1325280	After this happens, I look at the McFlurry Deliverer.
1325280	1328280	I'm like, what about the other thing I asked for?
1328280	1332280	And it looks up at the rest of Myriad
1332280	1334280	and about half of these creatures
1334280	1337280	stare directly into the portal
1337280	1339280	that is currently being attempted
1339280	1344280	and the other half looks directly at the beast,
1344280	1347280	this enormous, lumbering, dripping,
1347280	1351280	forming and reforming Gigant Umbropithecus.
1351280	1354280	So the first half is going to attempt
1354280	1356280	to help close the portal.
1356280	1357280	Fail.
1357280	1362280	And the second half is going to try to hold the beast
1362280	1365280	to keep it from moving again, and that is a success.
1365280	1369280	So that is going to hinder the Gigant Umbropithecus further.
1369280	1372280	And so you see about half of these little Myriad fuckers
1372280	1376280	Do any of these fuckers ever come out of the wall?
1376280	1378280	This is an adult podcast.
1378280	1380280	You said we could say anything on it.
1380280	1382280	I did not say that.
1384280	1386280	I think I explicitly said the opposite.
1386280	1388280	Why are you changing the rules?
1389280	1392280	Yeah, so half of these things look down
1392280	1395280	and try to put their hands out toward the portal
1395280	1397280	but nothing seems to be happening
1397280	1401280	as the MARY manipulating activator robot Y
1401280	1404280	seems to be doing a hefty, solid job
1404280	1406280	of making this portal appear.
1406280	1409280	And the other half do reach out their hands
1409280	1412280	and the beast that is off kilter already,
1412280	1415280	they seem to be helping the momentum of Planet Juggernaut
1415280	1417280	in whatever it's trying to do.
1417280	1421280	So that'll make it easier for Planet Juggernaut in the future.
1421280	1424280	And with that, it is the end of Myriad's turn
1424280	1428280	and the beginning of the turn of the Overseer.
1428280	1430280	The Overseer is still...
1430280	1434280	His focus is on Gigantupipidogum.
1435280	1437280	Gigantumbropithecus.
1438280	1441280	He wants to also aid in making this thing topple.
1441280	1445280	His goal, he saw Juggernaut bringing the tongue around the legs.
1445280	1447280	He wants it to fall down.
1447280	1451280	Oh, you want to know what would be a cool way to make something fall down?
1451280	1452280	Sure.
1452280	1453280	Do you have a thing?
1453280	1454280	Do you have a thing?
1454280	1456280	Well, I could...
1456280	1460280	You know when a guy kneels down behind a guy
1460280	1462280	and then he's stumbling back behind him?
1462280	1463280	That's what I was going to pick.
1463280	1464280	Tabletopping.
1464280	1465280	Yeah, tabletop.
1465280	1467280	Which we love tabletop.
1467280	1469280	Tabletop, that's what this is all about.
1469280	1470280	It's a tabletop game.
1470280	1473280	You know that big tube of light that it was trapped in earlier?
1473280	1475280	The Overseer could probably move it.
1475280	1476280	Well, it's funny you say that.
1476280	1479280	I wanted to startle it so it would try to move out of the way of something.
1479280	1481280	Okay, so you're going to couch the thing?
1481280	1482280	I'm going to couch it.
1482280	1483280	Yeah, no.
1483280	1484280	I think Overseer...
1484280	1486280	We just saw that Clark can do the light thing,
1486280	1488280	so we're going to let Clark startle it,
1488280	1491280	and we're going to have the Overseer bringing that tube down behind it.
1491280	1492280	That's rad.
1492280	1493280	I love it.
1493280	1497280	Okay, so first let's roll for the Overseer to bring the tube.
1497280	1498280	It's a 68.
1498280	1499280	That is a success.
1499280	1504280	You know how he made his face shine, Bryce, like that?
1504280	1507280	He does that right then,
1507280	1512280	but he takes his hand and he rubs it down the front of his face like that,
1512280	1515280	and he's holding a giant ball of light.
1515280	1518280	He chucks it right toward the thing,
1518280	1523280	and it bursts in front of its face in a blinding flash.
1523280	1525280	It's a flashbang of magic.
1525280	1526280	That's so cool.
1526280	1529280	Zach and I made the exact same sound.
1529280	1539280	We're like...
1539280	1542280	Next season, anytime somebody does something cool,
1542280	1544280	we'll all start sealing, is what we'll call it,
1544280	1548280	where we just make our best seal sounds,
1548280	1552280	which for some of them is...
1552280	1561280	Hey, we can sing together now, guys.
1561280	1562280	I know.
1562280	1565280	We used to do that all the time, but then it was like,
1565280	1568280	oh, there's some big old audio latency here.
1568280	1569280	I've been taking lessons.
1569280	1570280	Singing lessons?
1570280	1576280	Oh, we should have been taking improv lessons, bud.
1576280	1577280	And it's Clark Bishop.
1577280	1579280	Go ahead and roll to complete the plan.
1579280	1580280	Complete the plan.
1580280	1582280	Boy, if this doesn't work, it'll be interesting.
1582280	1583280	I pass.
1583280	1585280	It's a 24 on a 64.
1585280	1587280	The overseer blinds the guy,
1587280	1590280	and so now you have a split second
1590280	1592280	to put this thing in position.
1592280	1593280	Clark has seen the plan.
1593280	1594280	He knows the plan.
1594280	1596280	It was a plan before he even knew it was a plan,
1596280	1598280	and his hand stretches out toward that thing
1598280	1600280	that he had previously fucked up.
1600280	1602280	He let this thing out of that tube,
1602280	1604280	so he's like, I got to...
1604280	1607280	This is poetic justice here is what's happening,
1607280	1609280	and he just whips his hand.
1609280	1610280	Whips his hand.
1610280	1613280	It's a magical flourish of a hand whip.
1613280	1616280	As quick as somebody can turn their wrist,
1616280	1619280	that thing flies from where it was right down behind it.
1619280	1620280	So rad.
1620280	1621280	Oh.
1621280	1624280	Okay.
1624280	1627280	The Gigantover Vivigus is tilting,
1627280	1630280	and as with all large, large creatures,
1630280	1634280	it's basically in slow motion as it's just like, oh.
1634280	1639280	Can we have all the people in the liturgy blow,
1639280	1644280	all blow at once?
1644280	1646280	Yes.
1646280	1648280	Ready?
1648280	1651280	Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha,
1651280	1655280	shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.
1655280	1659280	Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.
1659280	1663280	Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.
1663280	1666280	The Gigantover Vivigus, stories tall,
1666280	1669280	dripping with ooze, made out of this thing
1669280	1671280	that you've been unsure of what it is
1671280	1673280	or why it's taking over your town,
1673280	1675280	the town of contention, for this entire time,
1675280	1678280	for the past, god, five days.
1678280	1683280	And...
1683280	1685280	It's forming and reforming.
1685280	1688280	You're never quite sure exactly where it is,
1688280	1691280	but in this moment, you do know
1691280	1694280	that it can no longer stand,
1694280	1697280	and it is now falling backwards,
1697280	1701280	having been table-topped by its former prison.
1701280	1706280	It is now the turn of the Don Jon AT-ST.
1706280	1710280	Well, hell, Uncle Don,
1710280	1712280	I got to say, I'm really enjoying this McFlurry.
1712280	1714280	I thought we were maybe more needed in this fight,
1714280	1717280	but it looks like that thing's fallen over.
1717280	1720280	Do you want to just share this McFlurry right here?
1721280	1725280	But as Kevin says that,
1725280	1730280	the ball runs off with you towards the fight.
1730280	1732280	Can I taste the McFlurry also?
1732280	1733280	Yes.
1733280	1735280	You're bumping everybody.
1735280	1737280	You're just passengers now,
1737280	1739280	and everybody's shaking really hard,
1739280	1740280	and you can see a lot of...
1740280	1741280	We got the Butterfinger?
1741280	1742280	M&M.
1742280	1743280	M&M.
1743280	1745280	You can see M&M's and McFlurry kind of chunking out,
1745280	1747280	but your brother, nephew,
1747280	1751280	unsteadily passes it over to you as best as he can.
1751280	1753280	Leaving a trail of colorful,
1753280	1756280	wet M&M's that are melting their colors
1756280	1758280	onto the illuminated land behind you.
1758280	1760280	Very nice.
1760280	1761280	Cool.
1761280	1763280	Yeah, roll to taste that.
1766280	1769280	My taste is one of my lowest skills.
1769280	1771280	It's only a 40, so...
1771280	1772280	What'd you get?
1772280	1774280	Oh, I didn't actually roll
1774280	1776280	because I didn't want to do that,
1776280	1778280	but yeah, I got a 29, so...
1778280	1779280	That's a long bit.
1779280	1780280	Yeah, I got a 29 on taste,
1780280	1782280	so what does that do, Zach?
1782280	1783280	Oh, you want me to describe?
1783280	1785280	Let me get inside your mouth real quick.
1785280	1786280	That means you get to taste it.
1786280	1787280	It just...
1787280	1788280	How do you think that tasted, Don?
1788280	1790280	I think he likes it.
1790280	1792280	Who don't like a McFlurry?
1792280	1794280	Don's lactose intolerant,
1794280	1796280	so he hasn't tasted a McFlurry in decades, but like...
1796280	1798280	Oh, but I don't have to experience the thing
1798280	1801280	because I can taste through your taste.
1801280	1803280	He's also been trapped in this world for decades,
1803280	1805280	seemingly, so that's probably a lot of things
1805280	1807280	he hasn't gotten to enjoy besides just dairy.
1807280	1808280	Uh-huh.
1808280	1810280	What's next on the agenda?
1810280	1812280	Cheese?
1812280	1815280	You got any cheese, boy?
1815280	1817280	Everybody's still really shaken
1817280	1820280	as this ball ATSD runs towards the fray,
1820280	1825280	but after Kevin John sees that Don succeeded on his roll
1825280	1827280	and got a good taste of this McFlurry,
1827280	1831280	he's like, hey, so, Uncle Don,
1831280	1833280	you're like magic and shit, right?
1833280	1836280	Oh, boy, I've learned a spell or two in my day,
1836280	1838280	possibly three.
1838280	1841280	You see John like strain and close his eyes pretty hard
1841280	1843280	and it looks like he's thinking,
1843280	1846280	and next to you from your ball leg,
1846280	1848280	another tendril shoots out,
1848280	1852280	and out of it is you would swear a Harry Potter wand
1852280	1854280	made out of tendrils.
1854280	1857280	And it's kind of like it taps you on the shoulder,
1857280	1859280	and it wants you to grab it.
1859280	1861280	I grab it to the best of my ability
1861280	1864280	with my weird limp arms and body.
1864280	1866280	Well, the ball is handing you,
1866280	1868280	and it's also kind of controlling you.
1868280	1870280	Yeah, yeah, so you try to grab it,
1870280	1873280	and when you can't, the tendril that's got your arm
1873280	1875280	kind of lifts your arm up to it.
1875280	1878280	It's like a ventriloquist grabbing the dummy's hand
1878280	1881280	and then, like, using it like,
1881280	1884280	my goddamn hand don't work as good as it did before.
1884280	1890280	And now you're grasping this thing's phallic appendage.
1891280	1893280	Now you're grasping this thing's wand.
1895280	1896280	Now, see, that's interesting,
1896280	1898280	because when I described a Harry Potter wand,
1898280	1900280	that doesn't seem super phallic,
1900280	1902280	but when you said when you're grasping this thing's wand,
1902280	1904280	all I could think of was a dick, so...
1904280	1905280	Okay.
1908280	1910280	I was just like, I balked at you calling it phallic at first,
1910280	1912280	but then as soon as you said wand out loud,
1912280	1914280	I was like, yeah, that sounds like a fucking cock.
1917280	1918280	So you grab the magic rod.
1918280	1919280	There's a nice neutral word.
1921280	1922280	What do you want me to do, boy?
1922280	1924280	What are we doing here? What's the plan?
1924280	1925280	We're gonna get into it.
1925280	1927280	We're gonna mix it up.
1927280	1931280	We're gonna add some petty more unpredictability to this fight,
1931280	1935280	but I feel through my ball bones
1935280	1937280	that you might be able to attenuate
1937280	1939280	to that little cock-like object you have in your hand.
1943280	1947280	Hopefully it will amplify and target your magic
1947280	1949280	towards our enemies.
1949280	1952280	Well, most of my magic's pretty close-up magic, I'd say.
1954280	1955280	It's a lot of card tricks.
1955280	1956280	It's a lot of card tricks.
1957280	1960280	Yeah, as you pull a fucking quarter from behind Kevin's ear.
1960280	1961280	Mostly street magic.
1962280	1963280	Yes.
1965280	1966280	It's a lot of hand.
1966280	1969280	Do I feel like I'm more powerful now?
1969280	1970280	Yeah, dude.
1970280	1971280	Being with the ball.
1971280	1973280	Well, I guess I'm seeing everyone
1973280	1977280	run towards the Gigantum umbripithecus.
1977280	1978280	Nailed it.
1978280	1979280	You got it.
1979280	1981280	And I'm gonna use devil hands,
1981280	1984280	but extend the range out with the magic wand.
1984280	1985280	Yeah.
1985280	1987280	I'm like, boy, you're about to see
1987280	1989280	the best devil hands you done ever seen.
1989280	1990280	Who are you devil-handsing?
1990280	1992280	The Gigantum umbripithecus.
1993280	1994280	Did you say it again?
1994280	1996280	When you say devil hands,
1996280	1998280	you're about to see the best devil hands you've ever seen.
1998280	2000280	Kevin John shrinks away from you
2000280	2002280	because that was another name for Uncle Slaps.
2004280	2006280	I just reach over and slap you.
2008280	2009280	Fucking dark.
2009280	2010280	Yeah.
2010280	2012280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2013280	2014280	It's hard to be a petty more.
2014280	2018280	And so when you devil hands this thing,
2018280	2020280	I need you to roll an unnatural.
2022280	2025280	I got a 62 on a 70, sorry.
2026280	2028280	You have unnatural memorized?
2028280	2030280	Well, I'm DM.
2030280	2032280	Step DM, what are you doing?
2032280	2034280	And so you, that's legit.
2038280	2039280	I mean, that is a funny thing to say,
2039280	2041280	just maybe not in that context.
2041280	2043280	Why'd you come up with that just then, bud?
2043280	2044280	Yeah.
2046280	2050280	Why didn't you save that for the much more sexual moment?
2052280	2053280	I mean, I was about to describe the magic
2053280	2055280	coming out the tip, so I thought I was-
2055280	2057280	Stepkeeper, what are you doing?
2062280	2065280	The magics of Don D. Pettymore
2065280	2068280	and the vector that is Baal
2068280	2073280	come together to form this unholy trinity
2073280	2078280	of both of them, and it just fires out.
2078280	2082280	I mean, you all see the first massive amount of color
2082280	2085280	you've seen in this world that isn't just technicolor.
2085280	2087280	What color is devil hands?
2087280	2089280	I pictured a crimson red.
2089280	2090280	Oh, yeah.
2090280	2093280	In my mind, I thought of holding the wand,
2093280	2098280	like my entire arm starts just glowing orange-red
2098280	2100280	and charging up, basically,
2100280	2103280	and then it extends through the rod.
2103280	2107280	As that's charging and extending, Kevin says,
2107280	2108280	Step Uncle.
2113280	2116280	The Gigantum Barpithecus already falling to the ground
2116280	2120280	is now blasting in the middle of its body,
2120280	2124280	which literally starts to unform at the center,
2124280	2129280	and the bolt of energy, this unnatural energy,
2129280	2132280	just goes rocketing through it,
2132280	2135280	but the thing is at an angle to where it's coming in
2135280	2137280	at the belly button area,
2137280	2140280	and it's blasting out the back of this thing's head,
2140280	2143280	and it's just falling to the ground,
2143280	2146280	and you hear this massive roar.
2155280	2157280	If Don were to look over,
2157280	2162280	he's not because he's concentrated on making the spell happen.
2162280	2166280	He would notice that his brother-nephew next to him
2166280	2170280	is turning into that technicolor muck one bit at a time.
2170280	2173280	It's flowing from the leg with Kevin Don
2173280	2177280	into your wand, out of the bag.
2177280	2180280	Kevin Don is being sacrificed for this spell.
2180280	2183280	The crimson-red bolt of energy
2183280	2187280	that is connected and blasting through is encircled.
2187280	2194280	Spiraling technicolor energy surrounds the crimson-red firebolt,
2194280	2198280	and when it connects to the Gigantum Barpithecus
2198280	2201280	already on its way down,
2201280	2204280	the crimson-red and technicolor stream
2204280	2209280	begins making its way throughout the entirety of the existence
2209280	2212280	of this enormous, unnatural creature,
2212280	2219280	and then the entirety of this forming and reforming structural beast,
2219280	2223280	this huge presence of this world
2223280	2226280	that has been feared by everyone who's been here
2226280	2228280	for as long as they can remember,
2228280	2231280	it just dissipates.
2231280	2233280	And then, like a bomb,
2233280	2237280	the spot erupts and technicolor shockwaves,
2237280	2242280	with hues of red breaking up every color between them,
2242280	2245280	send everyone huddling to the ground
2245280	2249280	in order to avoid being thrown off of their feet.
2249280	2252280	The Gigantum Barpithecus is no more.
2252280	2253280	Fuck yeah!
2253280	2255280	Fuck yeah, dude!
2255280	2256280	Whoa.
2259280	2262280	John Ball, you're fighting with a hole,
2262280	2264280	and a whole lotta Mary.
2269280	2273280	Okay, so Agents of Myriad have started streaming towards us.
2273280	2276280	They are attempting, from where they are,
2276280	2279280	to assist you in closing this portal.
2279280	2280280	However...
2280280	2281280	They've failed.
2281280	2282280	They've failed.
2282280	2286280	So, yeah, John Ball sees them try and fail,
2286280	2290280	and a lot of them wind up on their ass with the shockwave.
2290280	2294280	John shoots out impossibly long tendrils on either side
2294280	2298280	that kind of literally just throw every Myriad
2298280	2300280	who fell on their ass from the shockwave.
2300280	2303280	He just scoops them into the hole
2303280	2305280	and tosses them on in there.
2305280	2307280	Wait, I was writing down.
2307280	2309280	Did you throw the Myriad guys into the hole?
2309280	2310280	Yeah.
2310280	2311280	Nice. Holy shit.
2312280	2314280	We might need those guys, though.
2314280	2316280	Just the ones that fell down.
2316280	2319280	Just the ones who couldn't hold their weight.
2319280	2320280	All right, go ahead and roll.
2320280	2321280	Unnatural.
2321280	2324280	I totally forgot I had a better thing planned for this
2324280	2327280	where John Ball just turns into a bulldozer.
2327280	2329280	Oh.
2329280	2331280	Do that.
2331280	2332280	19.
2332280	2334280	That's a passed unnatural roll.
2334280	2337280	Myriad rolled 100 in order to keep themselves
2337280	2340280	from being used in this way.
2340280	2341280	It's a critical fail?
2341280	2342280	It's a critical fail.
2342280	2343280	The most critical fail?
2343280	2344280	It's the most critical fail.
2344280	2346280	They start running towards it.
2346280	2347280	Oh.
2347280	2352280	Dude, a bunch of the other ones see what you're doing
2352280	2356280	and throw themselves onto the pile as well,
2356280	2358280	and these are ones who were trying to help
2358280	2360280	and kept their feet under them,
2360280	2365280	but they throw themselves at the mercy of this John Ball creature
2365280	2367280	who clearly knows what he's doing,
2367280	2371280	and these things know that a portal shouldn't be open,
2371280	2374280	and some of them are even yelling out.
2374280	2377280	You see them communicating with each other,
2377280	2379280	and one is like,
2379280	2383280	Is that 1620216?
2383280	2385280	Yes! Yes! Yes!
2385280	2387280	The plane! The plane!
2387280	2389280	It's unstable! Close the portal!
2389280	2391280	Oh. Yeah.
2391280	2393280	It works.
2393280	2395280	Some of them look down, though, and you see,
2395280	2399280	Let's roll Humant, but it'll be at a negative 20.
2399280	2403280	Everyone, go ahead and roll Humant, but at a negative 20.
2403280	2407280	Fail. 47 on a modified 30.
2407280	2409280	We got a 42 on a modified 10.
2409280	2410280	Did you say at a negative 30?
2410280	2411280	Negative 20.
2411280	2412280	Oh. Yeah, I still failed.
2412280	2413280	Yeah, Kripp passed.
2413280	2414280	Hey!
2414280	2415280	When you...
2415280	2417280	Holy shit.
2417280	2419280	Which Keith is this?
2419280	2420280	Oh, that's a good question.
2420280	2421280	Should I roll for both, Keith?
2421280	2424280	No, it's not going to be the one that's up another one.
2424280	2429280	It's the one that's up on the ceiling that's slowly lowering the ocean of darkness.
2429280	2431280	He's got his own thing going on up there.
2431280	2433280	Yeah, he's preoccupied.
2433280	2436280	Yeah, no, it's the one who just dropped off the McFlurries,
2436280	2439280	turns and sees these myriad creatures,
2439280	2442280	and the ones who are blocking themselves over this portal,
2442280	2446280	and they're looking down, and you see on their faces.
2446280	2451280	Can I intently look in their eyes and see what the reflection in their eyes are?
2451280	2455280	The reflection is Tildi B. Mitchell looking up at them.
2455280	2456280	From the portal?
2456280	2459280	Yeah, and they're looking down at her,
2459280	2465280	and they're all very aware of how thin all of their skin is,
2465280	2468280	and how none of them have nails,
2468280	2471280	and they're having this weird crisis moment.
2471280	2475280	I didn't put two and two together in time just now.
2475280	2476280	I still have not.
2476280	2478280	Are they all Tildi B's?
2478280	2483280	They all have a lot of similar qualities physically.
2483280	2488280	Yeah, Keith did spells on Tildi B in order to try to find
2488280	2489280	Keith.
2489280	2494280	eternal life, which made her fingernails pop off,
2494280	2498280	and her skin very thin, and her hair fall out.
2498280	2500280	Holy shit!
2500280	2503280	One of the Keiths didn't have fingernails either.
2503280	2505280	What does this Keith think?
2505280	2507280	This Keith didn't get it until just now either.
2507280	2509280	What does Myriad think?
2509280	2512280	Myriad is confused as fuck.
2512280	2513280	Holy shit.
2513280	2515280	Might have sent the wrong thing into that portal.
2515280	2517280	This is fucking interesting.
2517280	2519280	The Keith that is up in the sky.
2519280	2520280	Wait.
2520280	2521280	No, I guess we could just go.
2521280	2522280	I don't know how to do this.
2522280	2523280	There's no way to do this in character,
2523280	2525280	but what does that make Marvin?
2525280	2528280	Were they part of the transformation?
2528280	2530280	They're a lesser of the Myriads?
2530280	2534280	You're looking at me and not Zach,
2534280	2536280	which is insane right now.
2537280	2542280	Or a step past Myriad.
2542280	2544280	It's just Zach's dumb little story.
2552280	2554280	Don't think about it too much.
2554280	2555280	I'm sure he didn't.
2562280	2565280	We're seeing that Tildi is like a prototype Myriad.
2565280	2569280	So I'm just wondering where on the scale is Marvin?
2569280	2571280	It seems like he's more advanced.
2571280	2576280	Or these things are so advanced that they're enlightened.
2576280	2579280	They don't even need human speech and all that.
2579280	2580280	That could be.
2580280	2583280	It seemed to me these were more like machine people almost,
2583280	2586280	though, and Marvin had a lot more of his own agency.
2586280	2589280	But maybe they're like a hive mind and they are more advanced.
2589280	2590280	I don't know.
2590280	2592280	They seem hive mindy until we interact with them.
2592280	2596280	They do that when they're amongst themselves.
2596280	2599280	And then whoever you're interacting with can direct the consciousness
2599280	2602280	towards you at that moment and send it out to everybody else.
2602280	2605280	That also seems more robot-y, like machine-linked.
2605280	2606280	For sure.
2606280	2608280	Marvin was like a crime lord.
2608280	2610280	A lot of their systems are number-based.
2610280	2612280	They say things in numbers.
2612280	2615280	When Keith looks into the reflection in their eyes
2615280	2619280	and sees Tildi and sees them and starts thinking about it,
2619280	2621280	he just walks over to the pile.
2622280	2623280	Yeah.
2623280	2624280	Cool.
2624280	2627280	He walks over to the pile and looks at one of them.
2627280	2630280	Did I do that?
2637280	2638280	Oh, man.
2638280	2641280	Is there any recognition in the Myriad thing's eyes
2641280	2644280	when he's looking at me?
2644280	2649280	I already gave you your McFlurries, Keith Ashley Bean.
2649280	2659280	The Keith that is up in the sky sea,
2659280	2665280	surrounded by countless unspeakable worm-like abominations.
2665280	2667280	They're rising out of the water.
2667280	2672280	They're tube-like, covered in squamous black partially translucent membranes.
2672280	2677280	Their bodies segmented as toxically green pulsating arteries and veins
2677280	2680280	can be seen through their thin-looking exterior.
2680280	2683280	They have no identifiable eyes or nose.
2683280	2686280	Their cavernous, circular mouths,
2686280	2689280	one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked teeth.
2689280	2693280	They're spitting out saliva that's somehow darker than black.
2693280	2698280	And from these maws, sharp stylets protrude
2698280	2703280	like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.
2703280	2710280	And you look down at the door-sized chunk of frozen worm keeping you afloat.
2710280	2716280	And as your eyes refocus on the darkness of the cold ocean around you,
2716280	2720280	you have a horrible realization.
2720280	2727280	This ocean is made of absolutely zero water.
2727280	2730280	It is not ooze, either.
2730280	2736280	This upside-down ceiling slowly lowering down toward the battlefield below
2736280	2743280	is made up of myriad small, slithering, squamous xenonimatodes.
2743280	2747280	That's why the waves crash in irregular patterns
2747280	2753280	and why being submerged has a strange sort of pressure, tightness,
2753280	2756280	that doesn't happen in water.
2756280	2761280	And these things begin crawling up your legs.
2761280	2766280	Keith looks around, looks at these little tiny worms crawling up his legs
2766280	2772280	and spots a worm not too far from his frozen door worm.
2772280	2777280	He gets out one of the saw blades that he'd been shooting,
2777280	2781280	and there's like a little hole in the middle of it.
2781280	2785280	He takes his pants off and shakes off the worms
2785280	2789280	and feeds one of his legs of his pants through that hole,
2789280	2794280	and then he jumps at the nearest worm with the intent of stabbing this saw
2794280	2800280	near the front towards the teeth, jumps over and tries to stick it in.
2800280	2804280	Okay, role melee combat.
2804280	2805280	I got a 4.
2805280	2807280	I got a 42.
2807280	2808280	Do you pass?
2808280	2809280	I do.
2809280	2810280	Yeah.
2810280	2813280	So what happens?
2813280	2819280	Before you can even lunge as you're tying off your pant leg
2819280	2823280	through this circular saw, these worms are climbing you.
2823280	2827280	As soon as your pants are off, these things are climbing your legs
2827280	2829280	and you realize that when they're climbing,
2829280	2833280	it's not individual ones getting any higher on you.
2833280	2838280	They're just sucking their little circular mouths, hooking into your skin,
2838280	2843280	and then the next one is just somehow crawling up on top of that one,
2843280	2846280	and it sucks onto you a little bit higher,
2846280	2852280	and then the next one, just these things running up your leg,
2852280	2859280	and your legs are just completely covered in these tiny little mouths
2859280	2863280	that are chunking out bits of your skin
2863280	2869280	and sending you mentally to a completely different place
2869280	2871280	as you take six damage.
2871280	2874280	I don't know what my health is on this, Keith.
2874280	2875280	Is this your main, Keith?
2875280	2877280	This was the Planet Juggernaut, Keith.
2877280	2879280	So it was full health, right?
2879280	2881280	No, I think it was low, wasn't it?
2881280	2883280	Didn't we start that fight really low?
2883280	2888280	Hold on, let me try this again, which does 36 points of damage.
2888280	2894280	Oh, I had 37.
2894280	2897280	I had a million, so.
2897280	2901280	It does a deadly amount of damage.
2901280	2906280	As I'm trying to jump off, I see what's happening,
2906280	2909280	and I use the circular saw to cut my legs off
2909280	2913280	so that I can get away from the worms and fly towards the other worms.
2913280	2916280	My God.
2916280	2920280	Zero sanity, Keith, that makes all the sense in the world,
2920280	2922280	and so this circular saw just...
2922280	2924280	You probably don't even make it to the second leg
2924280	2926280	after you go through that femoral artery.
2926280	2927280	No, we're going to go ahead,
2927280	2933280	and it's a whole new kind of samurai move that you've invented here
2933280	2938280	of taking a circular saw through the thigh in order to...
2938280	2939280	Die?
2939280	2943280	Ritually commit sudoku.
2943280	2944280	God dammit.
2944280	2949280	Or the Cubs announcer.
2949280	2951280	God dammit.
2951280	2954280	Oh my God, why do we think about that?
2954280	2956280	Zach, that's a terrible Harry Caray.
2956280	2957280	That was Nick Nichols.
2957280	2960280	I know.
2960280	2961280	What's Harry Caray sound like?
2961280	2964280	Like that.
2964280	2966280	He gets a little more breathless.
2966280	2971280	Yeah, Harry Caray watching the baseball game and calling the play.
2972280	2980280	Musical guest, Harry Caray.
2980280	2984280	What is the last thing that goes through Keith's mind before he dies?
2984280	2993280	A bunch of worms.
2993280	2995280	Planet Juggernaut, how do you land?
2995280	2999280	Okay, so Planet Juggernaut was kind of in his big arcing path
2999280	3004280	around the Gigantopropithecus when the rest of team good guy,
3004280	3010280	we think, baby, team our world, really stepped up
3010280	3012280	and knocked that fucker out.
3012280	3018280	So Planet Juggernaut kind of sees this and starts swinging back around.
3018280	3023280	He adjusts his path, and he's heading towards Mary in the portal.
3023280	3024280	A hundred percent.
3024280	3026280	So go ahead and roll.
3026280	3028280	I think we can make this happen this turn.
3028280	3029280	Oh, right.
3029280	3030280	So can he get to her this turn?
3030280	3031280	Uh-huh.
3031280	3033280	Okay, so he's going to try to just take her out.
3033280	3034280	Land on her?
3034280	3039280	Yeah, or just flatten her, just like he's heading right towards her.
3039280	3041280	69.
3041280	3042280	It's a 69.
3042280	3044280	Oh, my God.
3044280	3047280	It's a straight 69.
3047280	3049280	Oh, my God.
3049280	3053280	That's fucking amazing.
3053280	3055280	Describe this dinner for two, baby.
3055280	3059280	So Mary has dropped Rosemary, right?
3059280	3060280	That's right.
3060280	3064280	Okay, so it's a ball focusing all its energy onto this portal.
3064280	3067280	Yeah, it's got all of its tendrils except for two plugged in
3067280	3070280	because those two had been lasered off previously.
3070280	3074280	Mary is so focused on forming this portal
3074280	3076280	and bringing Tilda into this world
3076280	3082280	that she does not really notice the shadow that starts looming overhead,
3082280	3084280	getting bigger and darker.
3084280	3088280	And just as she thinks she's about to pull it through,
3088280	3092280	she's at her moment of utmost concentration.
3092280	3094280	Everything ends for Mary.
3094280	3096280	Everything goes black.
3096280	3102280	There's no more consciousness, no more pain, no more struggle.
3102280	3103280	The mission is over.
3103280	3105280	Mary is over.
3105280	3110280	The rest of the people in this weird world feel everything around them
3110280	3115280	reverberate as Planet Juggernaut crashes into the ground,
3115280	3120280	completely eliminating the portal, the Mary,
3120280	3125280	and it kind of pillows into the soft surface of this space.
3125280	3128280	And you don't hear the sound that you think you should
3128280	3133280	as it's kind of absorbed into the floor of this world a little bit
3133280	3136280	like you jumped on a soft pillow
3136280	3140280	and it comes to a rest over the space where Mary used to be.
3140280	3145280	One Keith Vigna, two Clark Bishops, one Planet Juggernaut,
3145280	3151280	one Ball named John, and an AT-ST holding the Dawn
3151280	3154280	exist out of combat.
3154280	3159280	And as Zack, the bald, mustachioed man sitting across from you,
3159280	3165280	continues to describe this group of people on this alternate plane,
3165280	3168280	figuring out what they're going to do next.
3168280	3173280	You notice the walls of this room swiftly change color and placement.
3173280	3178280	Suddenly, one wall is covered in a moving blanket that's been nailed up
3178280	3181280	to keep the daylight out of this baseball-themed room.
3181280	3184280	The adjacent walls have been painted Cardinals Red
3184280	3187280	with the St. Louis skyline and Busch Stadium,
3187280	3191280	and five friends sit around a desk and a table,
3191280	3194280	each with a microphone in front of their mouths.
3194280	3197280	Next to this enthusiastically narrating Zack
3197280	3201280	sits a chortling Justin with thick, curly hair,
3201280	3203280	clear frames on his glasses,
3203280	3208280	and a consistent giggle that reflects his compassion and tenderheartedness.
3208280	3211280	The chuckles continue as an in-character joke
3211280	3216280	is nimbly slipped in by this sharp, well-bearded Thomas,
3216280	3221280	who finger guns a Luke who is wearing a cute top and sick new shoes
3221280	3226280	and a hat that is both abstract and completely made out of leather.
3226280	3231280	And this comedically verdant Luke looks up into the sky and says,
3231280	3233280	Hell yeah.
3233280	3237280	He says that at the exact moment a charming, punctual Joe Terry
3237280	3240280	with long, windswept-in-a-nice-way hair
3240280	3243280	brings the group back to the story with a sentence
3243280	3246280	that is somehow both equally in and out of the story,
3246280	3252280	which leads this thankful Zack, distressingly unaware of me or you or any of us,
3252280	3257280	back into this group's current contention story,
3257280	3262280	in which the filter on the colorization changes as we all see the city.
3262280	3266280	Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it.
3266280	3269280	The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids.
3269280	3272280	There's a scent in the air like someone left out cheese
3272280	3275280	and a colostomy bag on every corner.
3275280	3279280	The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards
3279280	3284280	and the faces of the people bumbling about would be bloated and lifeless
3284280	3287280	if there were any people here, but there are not.
3287280	3291280	In a strange opposition to this depressive scenery
3291280	3294280	there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape
3294280	3297280	growing in every otherwise empty alleyway
3297280	3301280	and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads.
3301280	3305280	You all get the sense that this is some sort of nighttime,
3305280	3308280	though the stars are bright enough to light the sky.
3308280	3313280	Perhaps the people who live here are merely asleep or elsewhere.
3313280	3318280	And suddenly countless different versions of a group of contention police officers
3318280	3321280	fighting off some wild threat begin to appear from portals
3321280	3325280	placed pervasively throughout this city.
3325280	3328280	So I like to imagine the first group is clearly
3328280	3332280	Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV, Keith Vigna, and some sort of animal friend
3332280	3337280	all in astronaut suits, extravehicular mobility units
3337280	3339280	for you trivia people.
3339280	3343280	But along with these four there's a mind-shatteringly immense creature
3343280	3346280	squeezing its way into this existence.
3346280	3352280	This belief-wrecking monstrosity smells like rain and smoke
3352280	3355280	and the dried sweat of a loved one.
3355280	3357280	And it reminds you of a time you felt safe.
3357280	3360280	The next group through one of these many portals
3360280	3365280	is three myriad agents wearing pinstripe suits and trilby hats
3365280	3370280	blowing on whistles that sound like they say FBI when blown.
3370280	3377280	And they're chasing these four versions, these like mobster versions
3377280	3382280	of John, Keith, Clark, and whatever Justin is playing in this.
3382280	3384280	What would you look like?
3384280	3388280	Clark's wearing trousers with suspenders and a white shirt and a fedora.
3388280	3393280	And the white shirt doesn't fit quite right so the top few buttons are unbuttoned.
3393280	3398280	And maybe one of the suspender straps is a little bit dangly.
3398280	3401280	It's not quite fit right. And he's disheveled.
3401280	3407280	John is wearing a sleek black zoot suit with a large fedora.
3407280	3410280	And he's got a Tommy gun.
3410280	3414280	And he kind of shoves the disheveled Clark on by.
3414280	3418280	Come on guys, we gotta go. Book it, Keith.
3418280	3426280	Keith has a white cotton tank top on with some black dress pants that are quite big.
3426280	3428280	You know.
3428280	3431280	Like all of ours, it's the style of the time.
3431280	3436280	And he's got his tie around his head like a drunk guy at a wedding.
3436280	3438280	Yes, yes.
3438280	3445280	I do want to describe all of our ties which are somehow impossibly thick and pointy and short.
3445280	3447280	Like those crazy 40s ties.
3447280	3449280	Justin, what is your character wearing?
3449280	3455280	My character is all of the nickels together wearing the exact same tuxedo.
3459280	3461280	Nick, Nick, Dick, and Rick.
3461280	3464280	Yeah, all four of them are all together holding hands running.
3464280	3467280	Like the memes of the biblical angels.
3468280	3470280	Yes, there's just so many eyes.
3470280	3471280	Yeah.
3471280	3473280	And microphones.
3473280	3476280	Yeah, they all have old timey microphones.
3476280	3479280	You guys want to do one more variation on a theme or no?
3479280	3480280	Sure.
3480280	3482280	What is happening?
3484280	3492280	We are playing a game in a different game where we're playing the game in the city
3492280	3501280	where all these portals are opening up in the empty city and all of these different versions from different versions of...
3501280	3506280	We're meeting the versions of ourselves that alternate universes, versions of ourselves have created.
3506280	3507280	That's exactly right.
3507280	3508280	Into a shared game space.
3508280	3509280	Yeah.
3509280	3510280	Which is the city.
3510280	3511280	Love it.
3511280	3514280	And so the next group that comes in is...
3514280	3517280	They're all out of a Willy Wonka style situation.
3517280	3518280	Yes!
3518280	3519280	Okay, yes.
3519280	3527280	Yeah, so they're all being chased by this crazy man who is wearing two different top hats.
3527280	3531280	One's purple and one's green and they're both staying on his head for some reason.
3531280	3535280	And he's got pirate vibes.
3535280	3546280	He's got a pirate shirt on underneath a long tuxedo where the tail on the coat is actually 14 yards long.
3546280	3547280	That's right.
3547280	3550280	42 feet long and...
3557280	3562280	And what is Keith Vigna's Wonka character?
3562280	3566280	His clothes are just made out of banana Laffy Taffy.
3569280	3571280	Is he eating it as he's running?
3571280	3573280	He's chewing on the suspenders.
3573280	3574280	Keith isn't running.
3574280	3576280	Keith is in the bed that we're pushing.
3576280	3581280	And as soon as the guy catches up, he leaps up and spryly runs out.
3585280	3586280	You get a Wonka, Justin?
3586280	3588280	You get a Wonka character?
3588280	3589280	A Wonka character?
3589280	3590280	Yeah.
3590280	3597280	What about there's a beautiful cotton candy outfit of some kind?
3597280	3599280	Some kind.
3599280	3601280	Is that the Wonka?
3601280	3602280	Is that a Wonka?
3602280	3603280	That's the Wonka.
3603280	3604280	Is that a Wonka?
3604280	3609280	Clark's wearing a black turtleneck and he has a monocle.
3609280	3610280	Oh, yeah.
3610280	3612280	He was one of the parents of the children.
3612280	3613280	Yeah, that's perfect.
3613280	3616280	He got swept away after his child got taken.
3616280	3619280	And he's just following these people who seem like they know how to get out of here.
3619280	3629280	A small purple John Lee Pettymore holding a Tommy gun turns around and starts opening fire on the thing chasing them.
3629280	3635280	We keep doing this and every time John has a Tommy gun.
3635280	3642280	That's actually crazy because I wrote a thing in here where he doesn't have one.
3642280	3643280	Oh, wow.
3643280	3644280	Yeah, I know.
3644280	3645280	I know.
3645280	3646280	It's wild.
3646280	3648280	Did you imagine?
3648280	3658280	My final one is that busting through one of these portals into this weird city scene is Keith Beans in an Olympic style wrestling leotard.
3658280	3664280	Clark Bishop wearing a crown made of flowers with a guitar strapped to his back.
3664280	3672280	And you both look like you have what are oversized paper clips aimed directly at a John ball.
3672280	3677280	And at the end of each of these metal tendrils, what do you have?
3677280	3681280	Just a bunch of myriads with Tommy guns.
3681280	3691280	And they're just like, Clark, Keith, we only want to help as they blast bullets their way.
3691280	3705280	And as these five first class friends forged further into their fiction, another equally charismatic and likable group, us, us again, we're talking about us.
3705280	3712280	We're back in this room talking to each other and dealing with...
3712280	3720280	Zach, I don't want to freak your dick, but that's where we've been this whole time.
3720280	3722280	Consider my dick freaked.
3722280	3724280	Roll sanity.
3724280	3734280	Suddenly, you're all standing on this luminous land, free from the restraints of combat, looking around at each other.
3734280	3751280	When a sound like a swelling sea surf surrounds you and smothers your senses as an actual swelling sea surf consisting of cramped small-scale xenonematodes begins collapsing down toward you.
3751280	3756280	It has not stopped. It will continue. You are running out of time.
3756280	3765280	Thanks for wasting all our time with that alternate world shit.
3765280	3768280	It was like a round and a half. We could have been fighting those nematodes.
3768280	3770280	We could have been doing so much.
3770280	3772280	Shut up, Zach. Come on.
3782280	3794280	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.
3794280	3800280	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
3803280	3809280	What kind of world are you living in?
3824280	3833280	What kind of world are you living in?
3833280	3842280	What kind of world are you living in?
