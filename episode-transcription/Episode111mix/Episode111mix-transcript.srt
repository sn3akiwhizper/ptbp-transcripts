1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Welcome, my sour-creamy children.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,840
It's your yogurt craftsman, Wolf the Dog,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,640
and I'm here to leave out all the cream until it becomes art.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,320
Then I shall venture to the farmer's market to sell my wares by the barrel.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,960
I'm about to flood this farmer's market with that thick, nasty artisanal cream.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm warming up all the sour milk live from 694.2 PTBP,

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,840
the only yogurt creamery and, uh, radio station, I think.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,320
Speaking of that good cream, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,160
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Van Gogh's ear in Alberta, Canada,

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,800
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,680
which is one of the ways you can be chosen to write up a Howlin' with Wolf for this old wolf to howl.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,160
He writes,

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,080
No ooze is good ooze.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,320
All cops are bastards.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
And all dogs go to heaven.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,520
Things fell apart.

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,200
The sinner couldn't hold.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,840
The Stygian tide is loosed and everywhere.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
The ceremony of innocence is overcome.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,320
And what eldritch beast?

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,920
It's our come round at last.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,240
Slouches toward contention to be born?

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,600
Shout out to Irish Chris and Elena the Good Witch of the Midwest.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,960
Season one has been squamously good.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,840
We can't wait for season two.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,560
Thanks for all the creepin' terror, PTB crew.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,520
Damn Van Gogh's ear.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,440
I didn't know ears knew such fancy words and could compose poems or whatever.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,880
That's awesome for you, I bet.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,480
One time, I wrote a poem for a past lover.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,040
It was mainly just the letter E, but they got what I was puttin' down.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,560
It, uh, it was sexy talk is what I was puttin' down.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,120
And I just wanna let y'all know, not all dogs get into heaven.

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,880
Only a very small percentage of them actually do.

35
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,440
Weird, right?

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,000
If you wanna write up somethin' like Van Gogh's ear here,

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
then listen to me very carefully.

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,320
Write a five-star review for this five-star show on Apple Podcasts.

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,480
Then y'all should go and tag at Pretendin' Pod on all them damn social media things.

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,880
Then come on down to the subreddit and Discord too, why don't ya?

41
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Two more cool things.

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,720
First, my producer released a trailer for season one of Pretending to be People.

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,360
If I had a YouTube, I'd definitely look at it.

44
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,080
So what I need y'all to do is to look at it and then share it with all your internet buddies.

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:00,440
Next up, the 24th bonus episode over on Patreon is comin' out sooner than my cream starts curdlin' on a hot summer's day.

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,800
After y'all caught up with the creature crew,

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,880
join them PTBP friends Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Central Time in the Den of Sin.

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,240
For the conclusion of the mission in Moja.

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,040
Apparently that's a place where spooky things can happen,

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,480
but y'all gotta check the Patreon to find that out.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,320
Are there links for all that sloppin' more?

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,640
Why, yes.

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
Where are they?

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,600
They're in the show notes.

55
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,520
Just click on the thingy that shows you them damn show notes.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Do it for Wolfie, my babies.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm makin' puppy dog eyes at ya.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,960
And now I'm doin' this for y'all.

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,800
It's the gosh dang news.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Last time, I gave over the power, relinquished the duty,

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,480
forwent the honor of presenting the news.

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,720
But this time, you know what's goin' on.

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,280
Planet Juggernaut just crushed all of the Giganticumbic Hyrthpicithis' hopes and dreams with the fastball.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Took out the horde of incoming goo-drenched snatchy skeletons,

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,360
and turned it into a curveball-gotcha-tongue situation.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,480
You're sweet and sourly mistaken if you're lookin' for Dragon in 2.

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,120
This is Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

68
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline,

69
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,280
leavin' my mind at your altar,

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,280
crossin' the double line, doin' it every time.

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Tell me What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

72
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,280
What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

73
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Wow, wow, wow, come on down, everybody!

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,280
It's Nick Meckles and I'm here with my brother, Nick Meckles!

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Is that the energy we wanna start with?

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Nick Meckles! Nick Meckles!

77
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Yeah, sorry Justin, are you not amped up enough?

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh, do we need to amp you up?

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
I need to be amped up.

80
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Okay, let's get the energy going.

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.

82
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.

83
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
It's Nick Meckles time!

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Oh, everybody! It's Nick Goddamn Meckles!

85
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Round three and we're at the top of this, motherfucker.

86
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
What do you think about that, Nick Meckles?

87
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
I'm just surprised we're still standing here at our little,

88
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I guess, are we at like a little television desk?

89
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,280
No, we're standing on either side of Keith Vigna,

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,280
who's crying deeply into the ground and his hands.

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
I've got one microphone in his face,

92
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
you've got the other microphone in his face,

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,280
which means that we have four microphones between the two of us.

94
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
That's quite amazing.

95
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
I love that we found these extra microphones

96
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
in this extra dimensional plane.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Well, they're everywhere when we're around

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
and we're gonna go right to the business!

99
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Oh my God!

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Let's look up at that.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Do you see the big, gigantic,

102
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Gigant Umbropithecus right there,

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
the big guy who's being swung around,

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Planet Juggernaut's got his tongue swinging around

105
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,280
like Luke Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back.

106
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Do you see that?

107
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
I do see that.

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,280
Well, that guy is right up there!

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,280
The Gigant Umbropithecus reaches down

110
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,280
and takes another massive swipe across the land at the Liturgy.

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Am I using that right? At the...

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Yeah!

113
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,280
And so another chunk of this crooning group of chanters.

114
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Zach, it would be really asinine to stop you right now

115
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,280
just for a minor definition quibble.

116
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,280
That would be insane.

117
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
I liked it. I liked learning.

118
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
Love it.

119
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I like learning, and this is a illuminated land,

120
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
the Liturgy that I'm learning about.

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
About half of them straight up get consumed

122
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,280
into the forearm of this enormous beast

123
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,280
as it swipes across at this group.

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
And I was thinking about it, and I thought,

125
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
you know, we already rolled for, gosh, so many people.

126
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,280
We rolled for the Old West people.

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
We rolled for Jack Perlman.

128
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Oh!

129
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
We rolled for Drew Andrews.

130
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
We rolled for Councilwoman Carrie Pages.

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
We rolled for Harry Clinker, Everett Pace,

132
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Mildred Mitchell, Gary Daley, Jimmy Sanders,

133
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Professor Horace Green.

134
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,280
We rolled for a lot of people as well as a lot of pets.

135
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,280
And to put you guys through that again,

136
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I thought might be super duper fun.

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Let's go.

138
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,280
So basically what we're gonna do is,

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
as this enormous towering beast that's just oozing,

140
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,280
forming and reforming its tongue,

141
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
hanging out with Planet Juggernaut

142
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,280
at the end of this black ooze that it's held onto.

143
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
It swings around him.

144
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,280
And because Planet Juggernaut has this thing's tongue,

145
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,280
we're gonna take a negative 20%.

146
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
This thing will take a negative 20%.

147
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,280
So this time, we're gonna roll for some more NPCs,

148
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
whether or not they live

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
or whether or not they will be consumed,

150
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,280
and they each have a good 30% chance of non-existence,

151
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,280
which means a 70% chance of survival, which is big.

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
So I will start.

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I will go ahead and roll the first one

154
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,280
because we have just enough NPCs left for everyone

155
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
to have their own to roll for.

156
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,280
So I'm gonna start with Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280
So you see this very tall, very buff woman

158
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,280
dressed like she's in the Old West still.

159
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,280
She's got just insanely strong thighs.

160
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
And when you look at the thighs, you think to yourself-

161
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Watermelon busting hips.

162
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Yep.

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
100%.

164
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,280
And shout out to M from Michigan for giving us this NPC-

165
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
To maybe murder.

166
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
$10 level on Patreon.

167
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
You can write up an NPC.

168
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
They will kill.

169
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah.

170
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,280
So if it is a 30 or under-

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
They die?

172
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Yep.

173
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
95.

174
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Safe.

175
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Sweet life.

176
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Next up is Thomas.

177
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Thomas, I need you to roll

178
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,280
as we see the janitor of the First Church of Contention.

179
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,280
He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet.

180
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Casey Kristoff.

181
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,280
His beard gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt

182
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
all over his cutoff shorts,

183
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
his outfit of choice for the past 30 years,

184
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,280
and he is missing a hand.

185
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Spilling out all over his jorts

186
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,280
is a disgusting and amazing description.

187
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,280
And thankful for that description.

188
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I am, and you are, and we are,

189
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,280
to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City,

190
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,280
who wrote up Casey Kristoff for us.

191
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
I wear some of his underwear.

192
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
To 100?

193
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Yep.

194
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Thomas, 30 or under, and he gone.

195
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
42.

196
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Oh, that's a liver.

197
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
That's a liver.

198
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
That's a liver.

199
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Luke, I need you to roll for a man of average height.

200
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,280
He has dirty overalls and boots,

201
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
a trucker cap with long, oily hair

202
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
flowing out the bottom of it,

203
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
and a lip packed with chew,

204
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
the scent of booze on his breath,

205
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
oil-stained hands, and a ripped flannel.

206
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
You got your $3 back from Terence Liquor.

207
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Yep.

208
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Now let's see.

209
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I hope he dies.

210
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Oh!

211
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
He's dead as fuck.

212
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
It's a 29.

213
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,280
It's a 29 as Terence Liquor looks up

214
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
at the very end of his life.

215
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Literally, in my imagination,

216
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
the ooze must have taken him

217
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
as he was still just laying in the yard of Randy Yanks,

218
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,280
and so he has almost no time to come to his senses here

219
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,280
in this dark, luminous, landed plane of existence.

220
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
He had a bad day.

221
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,280
And he can't even remember what his voice sounds like

222
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,280
as he dissipates into the arm ooze

223
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
of this gigantic umbropithecus.

224
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Probably kind of ambiguously southern.

225
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Yeah.

226
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
If I had to guess.

227
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
That's a good guess, yeah.

228
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Shout-out to B. Crever for that lost life.

229
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Thank you for making Terence Liquor.

230
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
What a joy it was to have him in the game.

231
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
And next we have Joe.

232
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
I would like you to roll for an attractive woman

233
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
from the city,

234
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,280
and she has a large tortoiseshell glasses,

235
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,280
a full-sleeve tattoo of a robed figure

236
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,280
holding a ball of light on her left arm,

237
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,280
and she always wears blood-red lipstick.

238
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
That's right, it's Clara Blankenship.

239
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
We met her in the tunnels,

240
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
and she told us about a dream she'd had.

241
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Yes.

242
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Yes, and shout-out to Annie B.

243
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Annie B, your character lives.

244
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Oh!

245
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
It's a 45.

246
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Oh, my God, that was close.

247
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Annie, she is okay.

248
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,280
And Justin, this one's a new one.

249
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Shout-out to Sarah from Philadelphia.

250
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Just go ahead and roll over 30

251
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,280
for Archie and Taco.

252
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Archie and Taco, two dogs

253
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
to help fight the black ooze

254
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
with the Contention Creek Critter Coalition.

255
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Archie is a white lab mix,

256
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,280
and Taco is a Shetland sheepdog.

257
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
And then in parentheses,

258
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Sarah from Philadelphia has written,

259
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Just please don't kill my pups.

260
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Oh!

261
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Hey!

262
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Hey, Liv.

263
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
56.

264
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Wait, could you see that?

265
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I did, yes.

266
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Oh, nice.

267
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Yeah, that worked.

268
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
We sawed him.

269
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
We sawed him.

270
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Sawed him nice.

271
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Oh, wow, that was a really,

272
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
this thing is clearly off its balance.

273
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
It does not know.

274
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Yeah, it just did, it airballed.

275
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Yeah.

276
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
I mean, it was rough.

277
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
It took out the one we wanted.

278
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Tear of Slicker.

279
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah, we did miss one, yep.

280
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Literally, the people who are chanting

281
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,280
have noticed Tear of Slicker's lack of involvement

282
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
in the chant, and they just kind of pushed him

283
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
a little bit more towards the edge of the crowd.

284
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
And even that, I think,

285
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I feel like the gigantombropithecus

286
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
is maybe a little bit distracted

287
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,280
by the tongue Skywalker situation.

288
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
100%.

289
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
So maybe just like it whiffed,

290
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
and just unfortunately a huge drop of its ooze

291
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
just smothered Tear of Slicker,

292
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
like would pacify.

293
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
That's perfect.

294
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
And if it weren't for that Planet Juggernaut movement

295
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
with the negative 20%,

296
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,280
I think we would have lost a few more.

297
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Almost all of them, I think.

298
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,280
We hit a 42 and a 46.

299
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Now he's just bragging about how fucking cool

300
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Planet Juggernaut is.

301
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,280
No, I'm just bragging about how lucky our roles were.

302
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Immediately, Rosemary, M-A-R-Y,

303
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,280
removes itself from Rosemary.

304
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Can we roll to see if she got hit

305
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
by the Gigantombropithecus?

306
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Oh yeah, sure, I'll just roll.

307
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Don't look.

308
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Yeah, she's fine.

309
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
I did roll a 37, though.

310
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Rose M-A-R-Y pulls its remaining metal tendrils

311
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,280
up out of the face and back of the neck of Rosemary.

312
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Upon seeing John Ball...

313
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Filling her hole with the world.

314
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
That's right.

315
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Upon seeing this competition,

316
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,280
she's going to give it a bit more oomph

317
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,280
so she removes all of her tendrils

318
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
from the back of Rosemary.

319
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
She is now a free ball up in the air.

320
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
And she's free balling, thank you.

321
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,280
And so she plugs all of her tendrils

322
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
down into the hole, the portal,

323
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
that she is trying to open

324
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,280
in an attempt to focus more of her energy

325
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,280
to combat the situation that John Ball

326
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
is making happen.

327
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
However, with this,

328
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
she is leaving herself open and defenseless.

329
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,280
So I am not going to roll a dodge roll

330
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
for her this round,

331
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
and any combat directed at her

332
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
will be unopposed

333
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,280
as she is going to attempt to bring

334
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
some sort of creature from the other side,

335
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,280
which we can already kind of see

336
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
through this weird haze, this veil,

337
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
and just barely, we can all make out

338
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,280
a dark, dank, cold room.

339
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,280
And inside is a familiar skeletal creature

340
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
with skin so thin,

341
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,280
her bones protrude into view.

342
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Her nail beds are empty.

343
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Bruises and lesions cover her body.

344
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,280
But even through the hideous transformation,

345
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,280
you recognize Mildred's granddaughter.

346
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,280
And with pure hatred in her eyes,

347
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.

348
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Tildy B. Mitchell roars.

349
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
I cut you off.

350
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
We couldn't hear you.

351
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
I just saw the face.

352
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
The sort of resonance begins to emanate

353
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,280
from the manipulating activator robot Y,

354
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,280
and you all hear or feel a soft voice around you.

355
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Oh, is that what it stands for?

356
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Silas Cole, the fool who brought me

357
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
into his existence

358
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
and then left me out of all his plans,

359
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,280
even though the pitiful man couldn't figure out

360
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
how many beans make five.

361
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,280
I found him here, where I left him,

362
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,280
and he finally told me where he kept her,

363
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
experimented on her, and then abandoned her

364
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
for well over a century.

365
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,280
You, uncaring meat vessels, disgust me.

366
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
Uh, lady, it sounds like you just have

367
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
a problem with Silas.

368
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
That's Keith. Go get him.

369
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,280
And John Paul says this to M-A-R-Y,

370
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,280
and the camera does a whip pan over to Keith,

371
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,280
who is in between two very, very interested announcers

372
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
who have microphones shoved into his face,

373
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
but they suddenly are joined by another figure

374
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
who is a tall, gaunt, translucently skinned figure

375
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,280
in a large, black suit and black tie,

376
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
and it just sort of appears in front of this Keith Vigna,

377
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
who is on his knees,

378
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
crying into the luminous land below.

379
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
These myriad dudes have a lot of personality.

380
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I bet they'll make for a really good interview.

381
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,280
And this thing crouches down

382
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,280
and reaches out its two hands,

383
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
each with a McFlurry.

384
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes.

385
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,280
M&Ms in one, Oreo in the other.

386
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
That's beautiful.

387
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Oh.

388
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Keith Ashley beans!

389
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,280
I believe you requested these!

390
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Keith takes both the McFlurries, looks down in them,

391
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,280
and sees the Oreo one, takes a little bite,

392
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,280
and then he looks around for Don,

393
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
because he needs to deliver this M&M McFlurry.

394
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Okay.

395
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,280
When you look around, you find Don as...

396
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,280
You find him in a little different state

397
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
than you left him?

398
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,280
He has been subsumed by one of the Johns.

399
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,280
One of these balls has made him into a leg

400
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
of a sort of three-part operation,

401
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Don being one leg,

402
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
John being another leg,

403
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
and a ball floating atop in between them.

404
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,280
But also, Don seems to, from this perspective,

405
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,280
have full control over what he says and does.

406
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Am I attached at the scruff of the neck or something?

407
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Yeah, essentially.

408
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Cool. And I'm dangling around next to your nephew

409
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
and below your nephew's ball.

410
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Your nephew, but the body of your brother.

411
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Oh, right, yeah.

412
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Next to your brother, nephew,

413
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
which isn't the first time somebody's

414
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
had to be called that in the Pettymore family.

415
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
It's an old-fashioned Pettymore get-together.

416
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
So, Keith, you do see now where Don is.

417
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
That's right.

418
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
That drawing that you just made there, that's right.

419
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,280
And we'll post that on the social media

420
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
for everyone to see.

421
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,280
That should be our official episode post 111.

422
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,280
How far away is that from me?

423
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
The AT-ST of John Don?

424
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Yes.

425
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Don John AT-ST is a one-round John.

426
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
I take the McFlurries from...

427
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
You're welcome.

428
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I don't know where you came from.

429
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
It seems like maybe you just kind of blipped

430
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,280
into existence here.

431
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Can you take me over to them?

432
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
Okay.

433
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
And I, for like three or four seconds,

434
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280
just silently look at him, looking him up and down,

435
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
and I just hop on his back, like piggyback.

436
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,280
You don't blip out of existence, you do move there,

437
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
and you move there at an absurd rate

438
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
that you haven't felt really since this thing

439
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,280
clearly moved from on top of one of the mausoleums

440
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
in the city cemetery to you to put its hand

441
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
directly around your neck.

442
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,280
That was the last time that you felt this movement,

443
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
but this time you're a part of it.

444
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
And then you're standing in front of this AT-ST

445
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,280
that is already you guys practicing.

446
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Left, right, left, right.

447
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Keith hops off the creature's back

448
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,280
and is like, hey, and he holds up the M&M McFlurry

449
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
and looks at Don.

450
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
What the hell is this?

451
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
I try to slap it out of his hand.

452
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
You try to slap the McFlurry out of his hand?

453
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
This ain't the time for a McFlurry boy.

454
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Oh, hold on, Uncle John.

455
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Uh, Don.

456
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Hey, Avigna, if you're just passing out McFlurries

457
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
and you don't want one,

458
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I'll take that McFlurry right now.

459
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,280
He switches his hand over like a foot

460
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,280
and offers it to you.

461
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,280
John hanging there, he doesn't reach out for it.

462
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
He just extends his neck a little bit

463
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,280
and starts slurping from the McFlurry straw.

464
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I like to imagine I was slapping,

465
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
but my hands are barely moving.

466
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm just dangling back and forth

467
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
You're swinging your torso

468
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
and the noodle arms are going with it.

469
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm like, come on, boy, bring it closer.

470
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,280
After this happens, I look at the McFlurry Deliverer.

471
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm like, what about the other thing I asked for?

472
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,280
And it looks up at the rest of Myriad

473
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
and about half of these creatures

474
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
stare directly into the portal

475
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
that is currently being attempted

476
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,280
and the other half looks directly at the beast,

477
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,280
this enormous, lumbering, dripping,

478
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,280
forming and reforming Gigant Umbropithecus.

479
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,280
So the first half is going to attempt

480
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,280
to help close the portal.

481
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Fail.

482
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,280
And the second half is going to try to hold the beast

483
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,280
to keep it from moving again, and that is a success.

484
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,280
So that is going to hinder the Gigant Umbropithecus further.

485
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,280
And so you see about half of these little Myriad fuckers

486
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Do any of these fuckers ever come out of the wall?

487
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
This is an adult podcast.

488
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
You said we could say anything on it.

489
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I did not say that.

490
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I think I explicitly said the opposite.

491
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Why are you changing the rules?

492
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Yeah, so half of these things look down

493
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,280
and try to put their hands out toward the portal

494
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
but nothing seems to be happening

495
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,280
as the MARY manipulating activator robot Y

496
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
seems to be doing a hefty, solid job

497
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
of making this portal appear.

498
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,280
And the other half do reach out their hands

499
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
and the beast that is off kilter already,

500
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,280
they seem to be helping the momentum of Planet Juggernaut

501
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
in whatever it's trying to do.

502
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,280
So that'll make it easier for Planet Juggernaut in the future.

503
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,280
And with that, it is the end of Myriad's turn

504
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,280
and the beginning of the turn of the Overseer.

505
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
The Overseer is still...

506
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,280
His focus is on Gigantupipidogum.

507
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Gigantumbropithecus.

508
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,280
He wants to also aid in making this thing topple.

509
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,280
His goal, he saw Juggernaut bringing the tongue around the legs.

510
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
He wants it to fall down.

511
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Oh, you want to know what would be a cool way to make something fall down?

512
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Sure.

513
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Do you have a thing?

514
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Do you have a thing?

515
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Well, I could...

516
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,280
You know when a guy kneels down behind a guy

517
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
and then he's stumbling back behind him?

518
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
That's what I was going to pick.

519
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Tabletopping.

520
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Yeah, tabletop.

521
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Which we love tabletop.

522
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Tabletop, that's what this is all about.

523
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
It's a tabletop game.

524
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,280
You know that big tube of light that it was trapped in earlier?

525
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
The Overseer could probably move it.

526
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Well, it's funny you say that.

527
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I wanted to startle it so it would try to move out of the way of something.

528
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
Okay, so you're going to couch the thing?

529
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm going to couch it.

530
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Yeah, no.

531
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
I think Overseer...

532
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
We just saw that Clark can do the light thing,

533
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
so we're going to let Clark startle it,

534
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
and we're going to have the Overseer bringing that tube down behind it.

535
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
That's rad.

536
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I love it.

537
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Okay, so first let's roll for the Overseer to bring the tube.

538
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,280
It's a 68.

539
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
That is a success.

540
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,280
You know how he made his face shine, Bryce, like that?

541
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,280
He does that right then,

542
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,280
but he takes his hand and he rubs it down the front of his face like that,

543
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,280
and he's holding a giant ball of light.

544
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
He chucks it right toward the thing,

545
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,280
and it bursts in front of its face in a blinding flash.

546
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
It's a flashbang of magic.

547
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
That's so cool.

548
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Zach and I made the exact same sound.

549
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:39,280
We're like...

550
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,280
Next season, anytime somebody does something cool,

551
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
we'll all start sealing, is what we'll call it,

552
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,280
where we just make our best seal sounds,

553
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,280
which for some of them is...

554
00:25:52,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Hey, we can sing together now, guys.

555
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
I know.

556
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,280
We used to do that all the time, but then it was like,

557
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,280
oh, there's some big old audio latency here.

558
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
I've been taking lessons.

559
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Singing lessons?

560
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Oh, we should have been taking improv lessons, bud.

561
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
And it's Clark Bishop.

562
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Go ahead and roll to complete the plan.

563
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Complete the plan.

564
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Boy, if this doesn't work, it'll be interesting.

565
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I pass.

566
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
It's a 24 on a 64.

567
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
The overseer blinds the guy,

568
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,280
and so now you have a split second

569
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
to put this thing in position.

570
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Clark has seen the plan.

571
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
He knows the plan.

572
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
It was a plan before he even knew it was a plan,

573
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
and his hand stretches out toward that thing

574
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
that he had previously fucked up.

575
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
He let this thing out of that tube,

576
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
so he's like, I got to...

577
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,280
This is poetic justice here is what's happening,

578
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
and he just whips his hand.

579
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Whips his hand.

580
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
It's a magical flourish of a hand whip.

581
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
As quick as somebody can turn their wrist,

582
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,280
that thing flies from where it was right down behind it.

583
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
So rad.

584
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Oh.

585
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Okay.

586
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,280
The Gigantover Vivigus is tilting,

587
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,280
and as with all large, large creatures,

588
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,280
it's basically in slow motion as it's just like, oh.

589
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,280
Can we have all the people in the liturgy blow,

590
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,280
all blow at once?

591
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Yes.

592
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Ready?

593
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha,

594
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,280
shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.

595
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.

596
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.

597
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,280
The Gigantover Vivigus, stories tall,

598
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,280
dripping with ooze, made out of this thing

599
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
that you've been unsure of what it is

600
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
or why it's taking over your town,

601
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
the town of contention, for this entire time,

602
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,280
for the past, god, five days.

603
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,280
And...

604
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
It's forming and reforming.

605
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,280
You're never quite sure exactly where it is,

606
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,280
but in this moment, you do know

607
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,280
that it can no longer stand,

608
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
and it is now falling backwards,

609
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
having been table-topped by its former prison.

610
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,280
It is now the turn of the Don Jon AT-ST.

611
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Well, hell, Uncle Don,

612
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
I got to say, I'm really enjoying this McFlurry.

613
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I thought we were maybe more needed in this fight,

614
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,280
but it looks like that thing's fallen over.

615
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Do you want to just share this McFlurry right here?

616
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,280
But as Kevin says that,

617
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,280
the ball runs off with you towards the fight.

618
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Can I taste the McFlurry also?

619
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Yes.

620
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
You're bumping everybody.

621
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
You're just passengers now,

622
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
and everybody's shaking really hard,

623
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
and you can see a lot of...

624
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
We got the Butterfinger?

625
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
M&M.

626
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
M&M.

627
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
You can see M&M's and McFlurry kind of chunking out,

628
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
but your brother, nephew,

629
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,280
unsteadily passes it over to you as best as he can.

630
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Leaving a trail of colorful,

631
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,280
wet M&M's that are melting their colors

632
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
onto the illuminated land behind you.

633
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Very nice.

634
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Cool.

635
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Yeah, roll to taste that.

636
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,280
My taste is one of my lowest skills.

637
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
It's only a 40, so...

638
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
What'd you get?

639
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
Oh, I didn't actually roll

640
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
because I didn't want to do that,

641
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
but yeah, I got a 29, so...

642
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
That's a long bit.

643
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Yeah, I got a 29 on taste,

644
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
so what does that do, Zach?

645
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Oh, you want me to describe?

646
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Let me get inside your mouth real quick.

647
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
That means you get to taste it.

648
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
It just...

649
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
How do you think that tasted, Don?

650
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
I think he likes it.

651
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Who don't like a McFlurry?

652
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
Don's lactose intolerant,

653
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
so he hasn't tasted a McFlurry in decades, but like...

654
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Oh, but I don't have to experience the thing

655
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,280
because I can taste through your taste.

656
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
He's also been trapped in this world for decades,

657
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
seemingly, so that's probably a lot of things

658
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
he hasn't gotten to enjoy besides just dairy.

659
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Uh-huh.

660
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
What's next on the agenda?

661
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Cheese?

662
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,280
You got any cheese, boy?

663
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Everybody's still really shaken

664
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,280
as this ball ATSD runs towards the fray,

665
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,280
but after Kevin John sees that Don succeeded on his roll

666
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
and got a good taste of this McFlurry,

667
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,280
he's like, hey, so, Uncle Don,

668
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
you're like magic and shit, right?

669
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh, boy, I've learned a spell or two in my day,

670
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
possibly three.

671
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,280
You see John like strain and close his eyes pretty hard

672
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
and it looks like he's thinking,

673
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,280
and next to you from your ball leg,

674
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
another tendril shoots out,

675
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,280
and out of it is you would swear a Harry Potter wand

676
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
made out of tendrils.

677
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,280
And it's kind of like it taps you on the shoulder,

678
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
and it wants you to grab it.

679
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
I grab it to the best of my ability

680
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,280
with my weird limp arms and body.

681
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Well, the ball is handing you,

682
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
and it's also kind of controlling you.

683
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Yeah, yeah, so you try to grab it,

684
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,280
and when you can't, the tendril that's got your arm

685
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
kind of lifts your arm up to it.

686
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,280
It's like a ventriloquist grabbing the dummy's hand

687
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,280
and then, like, using it like,

688
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,280
my goddamn hand don't work as good as it did before.

689
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:30,280
And now you're grasping this thing's phallic appendage.

690
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Now you're grasping this thing's wand.

691
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Now, see, that's interesting,

692
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
because when I described a Harry Potter wand,

693
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
that doesn't seem super phallic,

694
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
but when you said when you're grasping this thing's wand,

695
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
all I could think of was a dick, so...

696
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Okay.

697
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
I was just like, I balked at you calling it phallic at first,

698
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
but then as soon as you said wand out loud,

699
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
I was like, yeah, that sounds like a fucking cock.

700
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
So you grab the magic rod.

701
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
There's a nice neutral word.

702
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
What do you want me to do, boy?

703
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,280
What are we doing here? What's the plan?

704
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
We're gonna get into it.

705
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
We're gonna mix it up.

706
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,280
We're gonna add some petty more unpredictability to this fight,

707
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,280
but I feel through my ball bones

708
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
that you might be able to attenuate

709
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
to that little cock-like object you have in your hand.

710
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Hopefully it will amplify and target your magic

711
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
towards our enemies.

712
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Well, most of my magic's pretty close-up magic, I'd say.

713
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
It's a lot of card tricks.

714
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
It's a lot of card tricks.

715
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Yeah, as you pull a fucking quarter from behind Kevin's ear.

716
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Mostly street magic.

717
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Yes.

718
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
It's a lot of hand.

719
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Do I feel like I'm more powerful now?

720
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Yeah, dude.

721
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Being with the ball.

722
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Well, I guess I'm seeing everyone

723
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,280
run towards the Gigantum umbripithecus.

724
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Nailed it.

725
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
You got it.

726
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
And I'm gonna use devil hands,

727
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,280
but extend the range out with the magic wand.

728
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
Yeah.

729
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
I'm like, boy, you're about to see

730
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
the best devil hands you done ever seen.

731
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Who are you devil-handsing?

732
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
The Gigantum umbripithecus.

733
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Did you say it again?

734
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
When you say devil hands,

735
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
you're about to see the best devil hands you've ever seen.

736
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Kevin John shrinks away from you

737
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
because that was another name for Uncle Slaps.

738
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
I just reach over and slap you.

739
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Fucking dark.

740
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Yeah.

741
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
It's hard to be a petty more.

743
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,280
And so when you devil hands this thing,

744
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I need you to roll an unnatural.

745
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I got a 62 on a 70, sorry.

746
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
You have unnatural memorized?

747
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Well, I'm DM.

748
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Step DM, what are you doing?

749
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
And so you, that's legit.

750
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
I mean, that is a funny thing to say,

751
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
just maybe not in that context.

752
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Why'd you come up with that just then, bud?

753
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Yeah.

754
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Why didn't you save that for the much more sexual moment?

755
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
I mean, I was about to describe the magic

756
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
coming out the tip, so I thought I was-

757
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Stepkeeper, what are you doing?

758
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,280
The magics of Don D. Pettymore

759
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
and the vector that is Baal

760
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,280
come together to form this unholy trinity

761
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,280
of both of them, and it just fires out.

762
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I mean, you all see the first massive amount of color

763
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,280
you've seen in this world that isn't just technicolor.

764
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
What color is devil hands?

765
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
I pictured a crimson red.

766
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Oh, yeah.

767
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,280
In my mind, I thought of holding the wand,

768
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,280
like my entire arm starts just glowing orange-red

769
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
and charging up, basically,

770
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
and then it extends through the rod.

771
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,280
As that's charging and extending, Kevin says,

772
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Step Uncle.

773
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,280
The Gigantum Barpithecus already falling to the ground

774
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
is now blasting in the middle of its body,

775
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,280
which literally starts to unform at the center,

776
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,280
and the bolt of energy, this unnatural energy,

777
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,280
just goes rocketing through it,

778
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,280
but the thing is at an angle to where it's coming in

779
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
at the belly button area,

780
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
and it's blasting out the back of this thing's head,

781
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,280
and it's just falling to the ground,

782
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,280
and you hear this massive roar.

783
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,280
If Don were to look over,

784
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,280
he's not because he's concentrated on making the spell happen.

785
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,280
He would notice that his brother-nephew next to him

786
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,280
is turning into that technicolor muck one bit at a time.

787
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,280
It's flowing from the leg with Kevin Don

788
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,280
into your wand, out of the bag.

789
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Kevin Don is being sacrificed for this spell.

790
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,280
The crimson-red bolt of energy

791
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,280
that is connected and blasting through is encircled.

792
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Spiraling technicolor energy surrounds the crimson-red firebolt,

793
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,280
and when it connects to the Gigantum Barpithecus

794
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,280
already on its way down,

795
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,280
the crimson-red and technicolor stream

796
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,280
begins making its way throughout the entirety of the existence

797
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,280
of this enormous, unnatural creature,

798
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,280
and then the entirety of this forming and reforming structural beast,

799
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,280
this huge presence of this world

800
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,280
that has been feared by everyone who's been here

801
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
for as long as they can remember,

802
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,280
it just dissipates.

803
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
And then, like a bomb,

804
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,280
the spot erupts and technicolor shockwaves,

805
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,280
with hues of red breaking up every color between them,

806
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,280
send everyone huddling to the ground

807
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,280
in order to avoid being thrown off of their feet.

808
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
The Gigantum Barpithecus is no more.

809
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Fuck yeah!

810
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
Fuck yeah, dude!

811
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Whoa.

812
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,280
John Ball, you're fighting with a hole,

813
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
and a whole lotta Mary.

814
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Okay, so Agents of Myriad have started streaming towards us.

815
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
They are attempting, from where they are,

816
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
to assist you in closing this portal.

817
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
However...

818
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
They've failed.

819
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
They've failed.

820
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,280
So, yeah, John Ball sees them try and fail,

821
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,280
and a lot of them wind up on their ass with the shockwave.

822
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,280
John shoots out impossibly long tendrils on either side

823
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,280
that kind of literally just throw every Myriad

824
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
who fell on their ass from the shockwave.

825
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,280
He just scoops them into the hole

826
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
and tosses them on in there.

827
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Wait, I was writing down.

828
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Did you throw the Myriad guys into the hole?

829
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Yeah.

830
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Nice. Holy shit.

831
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
We might need those guys, though.

832
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Just the ones that fell down.

833
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Just the ones who couldn't hold their weight.

834
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
All right, go ahead and roll.

835
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Unnatural.

836
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,280
I totally forgot I had a better thing planned for this

837
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,280
where John Ball just turns into a bulldozer.

838
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Oh.

839
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Do that.

840
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
19.

841
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
That's a passed unnatural roll.

842
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Myriad rolled 100 in order to keep themselves

843
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,280
from being used in this way.

844
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
It's a critical fail?

845
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
It's a critical fail.

846
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
The most critical fail?

847
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
It's the most critical fail.

848
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
They start running towards it.

849
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Oh.

850
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Dude, a bunch of the other ones see what you're doing

851
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,280
and throw themselves onto the pile as well,

852
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
and these are ones who were trying to help

853
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
and kept their feet under them,

854
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,280
but they throw themselves at the mercy of this John Ball creature

855
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
who clearly knows what he's doing,

856
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,280
and these things know that a portal shouldn't be open,

857
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,280
and some of them are even yelling out.

858
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,280
You see them communicating with each other,

859
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
and one is like,

860
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Is that 1620216?

861
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
Yes! Yes! Yes!

862
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
The plane! The plane!

863
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
It's unstable! Close the portal!

864
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Oh. Yeah.

865
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,280
It works.

866
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Some of them look down, though, and you see,

867
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,280
Let's roll Humant, but it'll be at a negative 20.

868
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Everyone, go ahead and roll Humant, but at a negative 20.

869
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Fail. 47 on a modified 30.

870
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
We got a 42 on a modified 10.

871
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Did you say at a negative 30?

872
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Negative 20.

873
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Oh. Yeah, I still failed.

874
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Yeah, Kripp passed.

875
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Hey!

876
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
When you...

877
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Holy shit.

878
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Which Keith is this?

879
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Oh, that's a good question.

880
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Should I roll for both, Keith?

881
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,280
No, it's not going to be the one that's up another one.

882
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,280
It's the one that's up on the ceiling that's slowly lowering the ocean of darkness.

883
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
He's got his own thing going on up there.

884
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Yeah, he's preoccupied.

885
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Yeah, no, it's the one who just dropped off the McFlurries,

886
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,280
turns and sees these myriad creatures,

887
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,280
and the ones who are blocking themselves over this portal,

888
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,280
and they're looking down, and you see on their faces.

889
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,280
Can I intently look in their eyes and see what the reflection in their eyes are?

890
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,280
The reflection is Tildi B. Mitchell looking up at them.

891
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
From the portal?

892
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Yeah, and they're looking down at her,

893
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,280
and they're all very aware of how thin all of their skin is,

894
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,280
and how none of them have nails,

895
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,280
and they're having this weird crisis moment.

896
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I didn't put two and two together in time just now.

897
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
I still have not.

898
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Are they all Tildi B's?

899
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,280
They all have a lot of similar qualities physically.

900
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah, Keith did spells on Tildi B in order to try to find

901
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Keith.

902
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,280
eternal life, which made her fingernails pop off,

903
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,280
and her skin very thin, and her hair fall out.

904
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
Holy shit!

905
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,280
One of the Keiths didn't have fingernails either.

906
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
What does this Keith think?

907
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
This Keith didn't get it until just now either.

908
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
What does Myriad think?

909
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Myriad is confused as fuck.

910
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Holy shit.

911
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Might have sent the wrong thing into that portal.

912
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
This is fucking interesting.

913
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
The Keith that is up in the sky.

914
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Wait.

915
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
No, I guess we could just go.

916
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I don't know how to do this.

917
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
There's no way to do this in character,

918
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
but what does that make Marvin?

919
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,280
Were they part of the transformation?

920
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
They're a lesser of the Myriads?

921
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,280
You're looking at me and not Zach,

922
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
which is insane right now.

923
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,280
Or a step past Myriad.

924
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,280
It's just Zach's dumb little story.

925
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Don't think about it too much.

926
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
I'm sure he didn't.

927
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,280
We're seeing that Tildi is like a prototype Myriad.

928
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,280
So I'm just wondering where on the scale is Marvin?

929
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
It seems like he's more advanced.

930
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Or these things are so advanced that they're enlightened.

931
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,280
They don't even need human speech and all that.

932
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
That could be.

933
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,280
It seemed to me these were more like machine people almost,

934
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,280
though, and Marvin had a lot more of his own agency.

935
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,280
But maybe they're like a hive mind and they are more advanced.

936
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
I don't know.

937
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
They seem hive mindy until we interact with them.

938
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,280
They do that when they're amongst themselves.

939
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,280
And then whoever you're interacting with can direct the consciousness

940
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
towards you at that moment and send it out to everybody else.

941
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,280
That also seems more robot-y, like machine-linked.

942
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
For sure.

943
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,280
Marvin was like a crime lord.

944
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
A lot of their systems are number-based.

945
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,280
They say things in numbers.

946
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,280
When Keith looks into the reflection in their eyes

947
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,280
and sees Tildi and sees them and starts thinking about it,

948
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
he just walks over to the pile.

949
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
Yeah.

950
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Cool.

951
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,280
He walks over to the pile and looks at one of them.

952
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Did I do that?

953
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Oh, man.

954
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Is there any recognition in the Myriad thing's eyes

955
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,280
when he's looking at me?

956
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,280
I already gave you your McFlurries, Keith Ashley Bean.

957
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:19,280
The Keith that is up in the sky sea,

958
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,280
surrounded by countless unspeakable worm-like abominations.

959
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
They're rising out of the water.

960
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,280
They're tube-like, covered in squamous black partially translucent membranes.

961
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,280
Their bodies segmented as toxically green pulsating arteries and veins

962
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,280
can be seen through their thin-looking exterior.

963
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,280
They have no identifiable eyes or nose.

964
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Their cavernous, circular mouths,

965
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,280
one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked teeth.

966
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,280
They're spitting out saliva that's somehow darker than black.

967
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,280
And from these maws, sharp stylets protrude

968
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:03,280
like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.

969
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,280
And you look down at the door-sized chunk of frozen worm keeping you afloat.

970
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:16,280
And as your eyes refocus on the darkness of the cold ocean around you,

971
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,280
you have a horrible realization.

972
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:27,280
This ocean is made of absolutely zero water.

973
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,280
It is not ooze, either.

974
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,280
This upside-down ceiling slowly lowering down toward the battlefield below

975
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,280
is made up of myriad small, slithering, squamous xenonimatodes.

976
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,280
That's why the waves crash in irregular patterns

977
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,280
and why being submerged has a strange sort of pressure, tightness,

978
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,280
that doesn't happen in water.

979
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,280
And these things begin crawling up your legs.

980
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,280
Keith looks around, looks at these little tiny worms crawling up his legs

981
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:12,280
and spots a worm not too far from his frozen door worm.

982
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,280
He gets out one of the saw blades that he'd been shooting,

983
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,280
and there's like a little hole in the middle of it.

984
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,280
He takes his pants off and shakes off the worms

985
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,280
and feeds one of his legs of his pants through that hole,

986
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,280
and then he jumps at the nearest worm with the intent of stabbing this saw

987
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,280
near the front towards the teeth, jumps over and tries to stick it in.

988
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,280
Okay, role melee combat.

989
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
I got a 4.

990
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
I got a 42.

991
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
Do you pass?

992
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,280
I do.

993
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
Yeah.

994
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,280
So what happens?

995
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,280
Before you can even lunge as you're tying off your pant leg

996
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,280
through this circular saw, these worms are climbing you.

997
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,280
As soon as your pants are off, these things are climbing your legs

998
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
and you realize that when they're climbing,

999
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,280
it's not individual ones getting any higher on you.

1000
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,280
They're just sucking their little circular mouths, hooking into your skin,

1001
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,280
and then the next one is just somehow crawling up on top of that one,

1002
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,280
and it sucks onto you a little bit higher,

1003
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:32,280
and then the next one, just these things running up your leg,

1004
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:39,280
and your legs are just completely covered in these tiny little mouths

1005
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,280
that are chunking out bits of your skin

1006
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,280
and sending you mentally to a completely different place

1007
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,280
as you take six damage.

1008
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,280
I don't know what my health is on this, Keith.

1009
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Is this your main, Keith?

1010
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,280
This was the Planet Juggernaut, Keith.

1011
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,280
So it was full health, right?

1012
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,280
No, I think it was low, wasn't it?

1013
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,280
Didn't we start that fight really low?

1014
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,280
Hold on, let me try this again, which does 36 points of damage.

1015
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,280
Oh, I had 37.

1016
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,280
I had a million, so.

1017
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
It does a deadly amount of damage.

1018
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,280
As I'm trying to jump off, I see what's happening,

1019
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,280
and I use the circular saw to cut my legs off

1020
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,280
so that I can get away from the worms and fly towards the other worms.

1021
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,280
My God.

1022
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Zero sanity, Keith, that makes all the sense in the world,

1023
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,280
and so this circular saw just...

1024
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,280
You probably don't even make it to the second leg

1025
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,280
after you go through that femoral artery.

1026
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
No, we're going to go ahead,

1027
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,280
and it's a whole new kind of samurai move that you've invented here

1028
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,280
of taking a circular saw through the thigh in order to...

1029
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
Die?

1030
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Ritually commit sudoku.

1031
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,280
God dammit.

1032
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:09,280
Or the Cubs announcer.

1033
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
God dammit.

1034
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,280
Oh my God, why do we think about that?

1035
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,280
Zach, that's a terrible Harry Caray.

1036
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,280
That was Nick Nichols.

1037
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,280
I know.

1038
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
What's Harry Caray sound like?

1039
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Like that.

1040
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,280
He gets a little more breathless.

1041
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,280
Yeah, Harry Caray watching the baseball game and calling the play.

1042
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:40,280
Musical guest, Harry Caray.

1043
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,280
What is the last thing that goes through Keith's mind before he dies?

1044
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:53,280
A bunch of worms.

1045
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,280
Planet Juggernaut, how do you land?

1046
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,280
Okay, so Planet Juggernaut was kind of in his big arcing path

1047
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,280
around the Gigantopropithecus when the rest of team good guy,

1048
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:10,280
we think, baby, team our world, really stepped up

1049
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,280
and knocked that fucker out.

1050
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:18,280
So Planet Juggernaut kind of sees this and starts swinging back around.

1051
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,280
He adjusts his path, and he's heading towards Mary in the portal.

1052
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,280
A hundred percent.

1053
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,280
So go ahead and roll.

1054
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,280
I think we can make this happen this turn.

1055
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,280
Oh, right.

1056
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,280
So can he get to her this turn?

1057
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,280
Uh-huh.

1058
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,280
Okay, so he's going to try to just take her out.

1059
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Land on her?

1060
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Yeah, or just flatten her, just like he's heading right towards her.

1061
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
69.

1062
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
It's a 69.

1063
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Oh, my God.

1064
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,280
It's a straight 69.

1065
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Oh, my God.

1066
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,280
That's fucking amazing.

1067
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
Describe this dinner for two, baby.

1068
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,280
So Mary has dropped Rosemary, right?

1069
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
That's right.

1070
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Okay, so it's a ball focusing all its energy onto this portal.

1071
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah, it's got all of its tendrils except for two plugged in

1072
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,280
because those two had been lasered off previously.

1073
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Mary is so focused on forming this portal

1074
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,280
and bringing Tilda into this world

1075
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,280
that she does not really notice the shadow that starts looming overhead,

1076
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,280
getting bigger and darker.

1077
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,280
And just as she thinks she's about to pull it through,

1078
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,280
she's at her moment of utmost concentration.

1079
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Everything ends for Mary.

1080
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,280
Everything goes black.

1081
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,280
There's no more consciousness, no more pain, no more struggle.

1082
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
The mission is over.

1083
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
Mary is over.

1084
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,280
The rest of the people in this weird world feel everything around them

1085
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,280
reverberate as Planet Juggernaut crashes into the ground,

1086
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,280
completely eliminating the portal, the Mary,

1087
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:05,280
and it kind of pillows into the soft surface of this space.

1088
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,280
And you don't hear the sound that you think you should

1089
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:13,280
as it's kind of absorbed into the floor of this world a little bit

1090
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,280
like you jumped on a soft pillow

1091
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,280
and it comes to a rest over the space where Mary used to be.

1092
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,280
One Keith Vigna, two Clark Bishops, one Planet Juggernaut,

1093
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,280
one Ball named John, and an AT-ST holding the Dawn

1094
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,280
exist out of combat.

1095
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,280
And as Zack, the bald, mustachioed man sitting across from you,

1096
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,280
continues to describe this group of people on this alternate plane,

1097
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,280
figuring out what they're going to do next.

1098
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,280
You notice the walls of this room swiftly change color and placement.

1099
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Suddenly, one wall is covered in a moving blanket that's been nailed up

1100
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,280
to keep the daylight out of this baseball-themed room.

1101
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,280
The adjacent walls have been painted Cardinals Red

1102
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,280
with the St. Louis skyline and Busch Stadium,

1103
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,280
and five friends sit around a desk and a table,

1104
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,280
each with a microphone in front of their mouths.

1105
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,280
Next to this enthusiastically narrating Zack

1106
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,280
sits a chortling Justin with thick, curly hair,

1107
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,280
clear frames on his glasses,

1108
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,280
and a consistent giggle that reflects his compassion and tenderheartedness.

1109
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,280
The chuckles continue as an in-character joke

1110
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,280
is nimbly slipped in by this sharp, well-bearded Thomas,

1111
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,280
who finger guns a Luke who is wearing a cute top and sick new shoes

1112
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,280
and a hat that is both abstract and completely made out of leather.

1113
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,280
And this comedically verdant Luke looks up into the sky and says,

1114
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Hell yeah.

1115
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,280
He says that at the exact moment a charming, punctual Joe Terry

1116
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,280
with long, windswept-in-a-nice-way hair

1117
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,280
brings the group back to the story with a sentence

1118
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,280
that is somehow both equally in and out of the story,

1119
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:12,280
which leads this thankful Zack, distressingly unaware of me or you or any of us,

1120
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,280
back into this group's current contention story,

1121
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,280
in which the filter on the colorization changes as we all see the city.

1122
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,280
Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it.

1123
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,280
The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids.

1124
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,280
There's a scent in the air like someone left out cheese

1125
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,280
and a colostomy bag on every corner.

1126
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,280
The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards

1127
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,280
and the faces of the people bumbling about would be bloated and lifeless

1128
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,280
if there were any people here, but there are not.

1129
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,280
In a strange opposition to this depressive scenery

1130
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,280
there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape

1131
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,280
growing in every otherwise empty alleyway

1132
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,280
and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads.

1133
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,280
You all get the sense that this is some sort of nighttime,

1134
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,280
though the stars are bright enough to light the sky.

1135
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,280
Perhaps the people who live here are merely asleep or elsewhere.

1136
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,280
And suddenly countless different versions of a group of contention police officers

1137
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,280
fighting off some wild threat begin to appear from portals

1138
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,280
placed pervasively throughout this city.

1139
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,280
So I like to imagine the first group is clearly

1140
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,280
Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV, Keith Vigna, and some sort of animal friend

1141
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,280
all in astronaut suits, extravehicular mobility units

1142
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,280
for you trivia people.

1143
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,280
But along with these four there's a mind-shatteringly immense creature

1144
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,280
squeezing its way into this existence.

1145
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:52,280
This belief-wrecking monstrosity smells like rain and smoke

1146
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,280
and the dried sweat of a loved one.

1147
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,280
And it reminds you of a time you felt safe.

1148
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,280
The next group through one of these many portals

1149
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,280
is three myriad agents wearing pinstripe suits and trilby hats

1150
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,280
blowing on whistles that sound like they say FBI when blown.

1151
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:17,280
And they're chasing these four versions, these like mobster versions

1152
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,280
of John, Keith, Clark, and whatever Justin is playing in this.

1153
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,280
What would you look like?

1154
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Clark's wearing trousers with suspenders and a white shirt and a fedora.

1155
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,280
And the white shirt doesn't fit quite right so the top few buttons are unbuttoned.

1156
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,280
And maybe one of the suspender straps is a little bit dangly.

1157
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,280
It's not quite fit right. And he's disheveled.

1158
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,280
John is wearing a sleek black zoot suit with a large fedora.

1159
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,280
And he's got a Tommy gun.

1160
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,280
And he kind of shoves the disheveled Clark on by.

1161
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,280
Come on guys, we gotta go. Book it, Keith.

1162
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:06,280
Keith has a white cotton tank top on with some black dress pants that are quite big.

1163
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,280
You know.

1164
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,280
Like all of ours, it's the style of the time.

1165
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,280
And he's got his tie around his head like a drunk guy at a wedding.

1166
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,280
Yes, yes.

1167
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:25,280
I do want to describe all of our ties which are somehow impossibly thick and pointy and short.

1168
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,280
Like those crazy 40s ties.

1169
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Justin, what is your character wearing?

1170
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,280
My character is all of the nickels together wearing the exact same tuxedo.

1171
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,280
Nick, Nick, Dick, and Rick.

1172
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,280
Yeah, all four of them are all together holding hands running.

1173
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,280
Like the memes of the biblical angels.

1174
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,280
Yes, there's just so many eyes.

1175
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
Yeah.

1176
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
And microphones.

1177
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,280
Yeah, they all have old timey microphones.

1178
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,280
You guys want to do one more variation on a theme or no?

1179
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,280
Sure.

1180
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,280
What is happening?

1181
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:12,280
We are playing a game in a different game where we're playing the game in the city

1182
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:21,280
where all these portals are opening up in the empty city and all of these different versions from different versions of...

1183
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,280
We're meeting the versions of ourselves that alternate universes, versions of ourselves have created.

1184
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,280
That's exactly right.

1185
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,280
Into a shared game space.

1186
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
Yeah.

1187
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,280
Which is the city.

1188
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,280
Love it.

1189
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,280
And so the next group that comes in is...

1190
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,280
They're all out of a Willy Wonka style situation.

1191
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
Yes!

1192
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,280
Okay, yes.

1193
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:47,280
Yeah, so they're all being chased by this crazy man who is wearing two different top hats.

1194
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,280
One's purple and one's green and they're both staying on his head for some reason.

1195
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,280
And he's got pirate vibes.

1196
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:06,280
He's got a pirate shirt on underneath a long tuxedo where the tail on the coat is actually 14 yards long.

1197
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,280
That's right.

1198
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,280
42 feet long and...

1199
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,280
And what is Keith Vigna's Wonka character?

1200
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,280
His clothes are just made out of banana Laffy Taffy.

1201
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,280
Is he eating it as he's running?

1202
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
He's chewing on the suspenders.

1203
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,280
Keith isn't running.

1204
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,280
Keith is in the bed that we're pushing.

1205
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,280
And as soon as the guy catches up, he leaps up and spryly runs out.

1206
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
You get a Wonka, Justin?

1207
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,280
You get a Wonka character?

1208
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,280
A Wonka character?

1209
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,280
Yeah.

1210
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:57,280
What about there's a beautiful cotton candy outfit of some kind?

1211
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Some kind.

1212
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,280
Is that the Wonka?

1213
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,280
Is that a Wonka?

1214
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,280
That's the Wonka.

1215
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,280
Is that a Wonka?

1216
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,280
Clark's wearing a black turtleneck and he has a monocle.

1217
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,280
Oh, yeah.

1218
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,280
He was one of the parents of the children.

1219
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,280
Yeah, that's perfect.

1220
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,280
He got swept away after his child got taken.

1221
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,280
And he's just following these people who seem like they know how to get out of here.

1222
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:29,280
A small purple John Lee Pettymore holding a Tommy gun turns around and starts opening fire on the thing chasing them.

1223
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,280
We keep doing this and every time John has a Tommy gun.

1224
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:42,280
That's actually crazy because I wrote a thing in here where he doesn't have one.

1225
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,280
Oh, wow.

1226
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Yeah, I know.

1227
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,280
I know.

1228
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,280
It's wild.

1229
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,280
Did you imagine?

1230
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:58,280
My final one is that busting through one of these portals into this weird city scene is Keith Beans in an Olympic style wrestling leotard.

1231
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Clark Bishop wearing a crown made of flowers with a guitar strapped to his back.

1232
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:12,280
And you both look like you have what are oversized paper clips aimed directly at a John ball.

1233
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,280
And at the end of each of these metal tendrils, what do you have?

1234
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,280
Just a bunch of myriads with Tommy guns.

1235
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:31,280
And they're just like, Clark, Keith, we only want to help as they blast bullets their way.

1236
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:45,280
And as these five first class friends forged further into their fiction, another equally charismatic and likable group, us, us again, we're talking about us.

1237
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:52,280
We're back in this room talking to each other and dealing with...

1238
01:01:52,280 --> 01:02:00,280
Zach, I don't want to freak your dick, but that's where we've been this whole time.

1239
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Consider my dick freaked.

1240
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,280
Roll sanity.

1241
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:14,280
Suddenly, you're all standing on this luminous land, free from the restraints of combat, looking around at each other.

1242
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:31,280
When a sound like a swelling sea surf surrounds you and smothers your senses as an actual swelling sea surf consisting of cramped small-scale xenonematodes begins collapsing down toward you.

1243
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,280
It has not stopped. It will continue. You are running out of time.

1244
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:45,280
Thanks for wasting all our time with that alternate world shit.

1245
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,280
It was like a round and a half. We could have been fighting those nematodes.

1246
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,280
We could have been doing so much.

1247
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,280
Shut up, Zach. Come on.

1248
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:14,280
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.

1249
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:20,280
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

1250
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:29,280
What kind of world are you living in?

1251
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:53,280
What kind of world are you living in?

1252
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:02,280
What kind of world are you living in?
