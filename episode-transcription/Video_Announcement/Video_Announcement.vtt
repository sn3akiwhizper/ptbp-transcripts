00:00.000 --> 00:10.420
The hardest part of waking up is deciding what to wear, but today I woke up missing

00:10.420 --> 00:14.240
me, and it's been downhill from there.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.440
One, two, three!

00:16.440 --> 00:18.980
What's up, everybody?

00:18.980 --> 00:19.980
I'm Zach.

00:19.980 --> 00:20.980
It's me.

00:20.980 --> 00:21.980
I'm here.

00:21.980 --> 00:22.980
Hey.

00:22.980 --> 00:23.980
What's up, everybody?

00:23.980 --> 00:24.980
It's Zach.

00:24.980 --> 00:25.980
I'm here with...

00:25.980 --> 00:26.980
Who?

00:26.980 --> 00:29.980
Let's do it one more time.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.280
You can have the energy to the first one.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.280
It was good.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
Yeah, everybody!

00:33.280 --> 00:34.280
No, I'm back.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.280
Well, hello there.

00:35.280 --> 00:42.480
I'm Zach, and this is an announcement that I'm pretty excited about.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.960
I tossed.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.480
I wasn't giving you an intentional, you did bad face until that last one, which was creepy.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.480
Hey, everybody.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.480
Hey, everybody.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
Watch our video.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.480
Daddy's here.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.480
Hey, Daddy.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.480
Daddy.

00:54.480 --> 00:59.180
It's me, Daddy, and I'm here to tell you...

00:59.180 --> 01:00.180
I'm not that one.

01:00.180 --> 01:01.180
Okay.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.180
Hey, guys.

01:02.180 --> 01:04.600
We made a promo video.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
Yeah.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.720
We're really excited about it, and we wanted to let you know and encourage you to watch

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
and share it.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.080
As you're listening, you can go watch.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.080
You can find it on our YouTube.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
YouTube.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.080
But we'll also have it posted places.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.080
Links to the YouTube.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.080
Twitter.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.080
Social media.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
Instagram.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.080
Fuck all those people, and fuck Matt Huffman, I think is his name.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
Which one's that?

01:24.080 --> 01:26.080
I think he's the Reddit guy.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.080
Fuck Greg Huffman.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.980
The Reddit guy.

01:30.980 --> 01:31.980
Fucking whatever.

01:31.980 --> 01:34.980
Anyway, we have a Reddit, and we're going to be sharing it around on there, and if you

01:34.980 --> 01:41.300
feel like, I don't know, commenting about if you like the show or telling people about

01:41.300 --> 01:42.500
it on there.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.220
Maybe send in people a YouTube link.

01:44.220 --> 01:45.220
Yep.

01:45.220 --> 01:47.200
Which you can find on the Reddit and all the other social medias.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.300
We think you're going to like it.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.580
We hope you're going to like it.

01:49.580 --> 01:50.580
We really like it.

01:50.580 --> 01:51.580
We want to thank our friends who did it.

01:51.580 --> 01:56.860
It was made by some really good friends of ours who are really talented and very kind

01:56.860 --> 01:58.720
people at Mood Ring Films.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
Mood Ring Films.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
So lovely.

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
Paul and Nicky.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
Paul and Nicky did an excellent job.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.720
It's so good.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.000
Isaac and Michael and...

02:05.000 --> 02:11.480
Isaac and Michael and Jonathan, and each brought so much to the couple shoot days that we had.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.640
We knocked it out of the park.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.640
Absolutely.

02:14.640 --> 02:19.800
Each individual one nailed their job, and were an absolute pleasure to be around, and

02:19.800 --> 02:21.200
we had a great time on set.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.400
We got to have a fun time and not do any of the work.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
Yeah!

02:25.940 --> 02:26.940
It was so easy for us.

02:26.940 --> 02:31.460
And yeah, this video looks amazing and makes our podcast look way better than it is.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.460
Yeah!

02:32.460 --> 02:33.460
Which is very nice of them.

02:33.460 --> 02:34.460
But don't tell people that.

02:34.460 --> 02:35.460
No.

02:35.460 --> 02:36.460
Yeah, tell people it's good, right?

02:36.460 --> 02:37.460
Yeah.

02:37.460 --> 02:43.340
Be like, I honestly expected more out of this video, but you should watch it anyway.

02:43.340 --> 02:49.300
We're just so thankful that you have allowed us to get to this position by listening and

02:49.300 --> 02:55.060
following along with our silly stories that we're having such a fucking good time creating

02:55.120 --> 02:57.200
and sharing, so yeah.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
Thanks.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
So go share it with your friends!

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
Go like it everywhere.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
Go upvote it.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
Go comment.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
Go share it.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
Send the links.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.200
Watch it on repeat on YouTube on all your devices.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.000
Leave it just playing in the background.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.520
Oh, that would be good, actually.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.200
We will consider it a failure if it doesn't hit five million views in the first hour.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
In the first hour.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Right.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
To get to work.

03:17.200 --> 03:22.480
So yeah, if you want us to keep loving you, you can either donate to the Patreon or share

03:22.480 --> 03:32.140
this fucking video around, so like, one's free.

03:32.140 --> 03:36.700
It's not like that, but please share.

03:36.700 --> 03:37.700
Thanks for listening.

03:37.700 --> 03:38.700
Yeah, thanks for listening.

03:38.700 --> 03:44.340
You're gonna like the way it looks.

03:44.340 --> 03:45.340
We guarantee it.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.340
Boom.

03:46.340 --> 03:55.340
And it's all my fault, cause my life is great.

03:55.340 --> 04:09.340
And it's all mine, cause my life is great.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.340
Fuck that up, man.

04:11.340 --> 04:13.340
I think he's the Reddit guy.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.820
You know, but the Reddit is a good point.

04:15.820 --> 04:22.540
We have a Reddit profile that we'll share it, we'll share it, we'll share it.

04:22.540 --> 04:24.140
Let's do it from the top, man.

04:24.140 --> 04:25.140
Yeah.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.140
Fuck Steve Huffman.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.940
Everybody just yell, fuck Steve Huffman, and I'll get it.

04:27.940 --> 04:30.300
Is that even his name?

04:30.300 --> 04:31.300
I'm pretty sure it's right.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.300
Don't look it up.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.460
It'd be so good if it wasn't.

04:35.460 --> 04:40.220
Steve Huffman is a Nobel Peace Prize winning philanthropist.

04:40.220 --> 04:41.220
It's Craig.

04:41.220 --> 04:42.220
It's Craig?

04:43.220 --> 04:44.220
It's Craig.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.220
Fuck Craig Huffman.

04:45.220 --> 04:46.220
Fuck Craig Huffman.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.220
Craig!

04:47.220 --> 04:48.220
Craig!

04:48.220 --> 04:49.220
Thank you, Craig.

04:49.220 --> 04:50.220
Three, two, one...

04:50.220 --> 04:51.220
And it's all my fault!

04:51.220 --> 05:10.220
Today I woke up missing me.

05:10.220 --> 05:18.220
I forgot her yesterday, where I left my made-up enemies, and this song was not a thing.

05:18.220 --> 05:27.900
And the truth is, this is 100% real, cause my life is wonderful, and I blame it on me.
