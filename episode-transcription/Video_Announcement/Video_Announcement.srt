1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,420
The hardest part of waking up is deciding what to wear, but today I woke up missing

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,240
me, and it's been downhill from there.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,440
One, two, three!

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,980
What's up, everybody?

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm Zach.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:20,980
It's me.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,980
I'm here.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,980
Hey.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
What's up, everybody?

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,980
It's Zach.

11
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm here with...

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
Who?

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,980
Let's do it one more time.

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,280
You can have the energy to the first one.

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,280
It was good.

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Yeah, everybody!

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
No, I'm back.

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
Well, hello there.

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,480
I'm Zach, and this is an announcement that I'm pretty excited about.

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,960
I tossed.

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,480
I wasn't giving you an intentional, you did bad face until that last one, which was creepy.

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Hey, everybody.

23
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Hey, everybody.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
Watch our video.

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
Daddy's here.

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Hey, Daddy.

27
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Daddy.

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,180
It's me, Daddy, and I'm here to tell you...

29
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
I'm not that one.

30
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,180
Okay.

31
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,180
Hey, guys.

32
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,600
We made a promo video.

33
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Yeah.

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,720
We're really excited about it, and we wanted to let you know and encourage you to watch

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
and share it.

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,080
As you're listening, you can go watch.

37
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
You can find it on our YouTube.

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
YouTube.

39
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,080
But we'll also have it posted places.

40
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Links to the YouTube.

41
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Twitter.

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,080
Social media.

43
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Instagram.

44
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Fuck all those people, and fuck Matt Huffman, I think is his name.

45
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Which one's that?

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
I think he's the Reddit guy.

47
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Fuck Greg Huffman.

48
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,980
The Reddit guy.

49
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,980
Fucking whatever.

50
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,980
Anyway, we have a Reddit, and we're going to be sharing it around on there, and if you

51
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,300
feel like, I don't know, commenting about if you like the show or telling people about

52
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,500
it on there.

53
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,220
Maybe send in people a YouTube link.

54
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,220
Yep.

55
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,200
Which you can find on the Reddit and all the other social medias.

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,300
We think you're going to like it.

57
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,580
We hope you're going to like it.

58
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
We really like it.

59
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
We want to thank our friends who did it.

60
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,860
It was made by some really good friends of ours who are really talented and very kind

61
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,720
people at Mood Ring Films.

62
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
Mood Ring Films.

63
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
So lovely.

64
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Paul and Nicky.

65
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Paul and Nicky did an excellent job.

66
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
It's so good.

67
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,000
Isaac and Michael and...

68
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,480
Isaac and Michael and Jonathan, and each brought so much to the couple shoot days that we had.

69
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,640
We knocked it out of the park.

70
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Absolutely.

71
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,800
Each individual one nailed their job, and were an absolute pleasure to be around, and

72
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
we had a great time on set.

73
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
We got to have a fun time and not do any of the work.

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah!

75
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
It was so easy for us.

76
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,460
And yeah, this video looks amazing and makes our podcast look way better than it is.

77
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
Yeah!

78
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
Which is very nice of them.

79
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
But don't tell people that.

80
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,460
No.

81
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Yeah, tell people it's good, right?

82
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Yeah.

83
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,340
Be like, I honestly expected more out of this video, but you should watch it anyway.

84
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,300
We're just so thankful that you have allowed us to get to this position by listening and

85
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,060
following along with our silly stories that we're having such a fucking good time creating

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
and sharing, so yeah.

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Thanks.

88
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
So go share it with your friends!

89
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Go like it everywhere.

90
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Go upvote it.

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Go comment.

92
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Go share it.

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Send the links.

94
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Watch it on repeat on YouTube on all your devices.

95
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,000
Leave it just playing in the background.

96
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
Oh, that would be good, actually.

97
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,200
We will consider it a failure if it doesn't hit five million views in the first hour.

98
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
In the first hour.

99
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Right.

100
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
To get to work.

101
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,480
So yeah, if you want us to keep loving you, you can either donate to the Patreon or share

102
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:32,140
this fucking video around, so like, one's free.

103
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,700
It's not like that, but please share.

104
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Thanks for listening.

105
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Yeah, thanks for listening.

106
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,340
You're gonna like the way it looks.

107
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,340
We guarantee it.

108
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Boom.

109
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:55,340
And it's all my fault, cause my life is great.

110
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:09,340
And it's all mine, cause my life is great.

111
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
Fuck that up, man.

112
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
I think he's the Reddit guy.

113
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,820
You know, but the Reddit is a good point.

114
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:22,540
We have a Reddit profile that we'll share it, we'll share it, we'll share it.

115
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,140
Let's do it from the top, man.

116
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,140
Yeah.

117
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
Fuck Steve Huffman.

118
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,940
Everybody just yell, fuck Steve Huffman, and I'll get it.

119
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,300
Is that even his name?

120
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm pretty sure it's right.

121
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Don't look it up.

122
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,460
It'd be so good if it wasn't.

123
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,220
Steve Huffman is a Nobel Peace Prize winning philanthropist.

124
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
It's Craig.

125
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
It's Craig?

126
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,220
It's Craig.

127
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
Fuck Craig Huffman.

128
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,220
Fuck Craig Huffman.

129
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
Craig!

130
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
Craig!

131
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Thank you, Craig.

132
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Three, two, one...

133
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,220
And it's all my fault!

134
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Today I woke up missing me.

135
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:18,220
I forgot her yesterday, where I left my made-up enemies, and this song was not a thing.

136
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:27,900
And the truth is, this is 100% real, cause my life is wonderful, and I blame it on me.
