10420	14240	me, and it's been downhill from there.

31280	32280	It was good.
32280	33280	Yeah, everybody!
33280	34280	No, I'm back.
34280	35280	Well, hello there.
35280	42480	I'm Zach, and this is an announcement that I'm pretty excited about.
42480	43960	I tossed.
43960	48480	I wasn't giving you an intentional, you did bad face until that last one, which was creepy.
48480	49480	Hey, everybody.

133640	134640	Absolutely.
134640	139800	Each individual one nailed their job, and were an absolute pleasure to be around, and
139800	141200	we had a great time on set.

144400	145400	Yeah!
145940	146940	It was so easy for us.
146940	151460	And yeah, this video looks amazing and makes our podcast look way better than it is.

152460	153460	Which is very nice of them.
153460	154460	But don't tell people that.

186200	188000	Leave it just playing in the background.
188000	189520	Oh, that would be good, actually.
189520	194200	We will consider it a failure if it doesn't hit five million views in the first hour.
194200	195200	In the first hour.

226340	235340	And it's all my fault, cause my life is great.
235340	249340	And it's all mine, cause my life is great.
249340	251340	Fuck that up, man.
251340	253340	I think he's the Reddit guy.
253340	255820	You know, but the Reddit is a good point.
255820	262540	We have a Reddit profile that we'll share it, we'll share it, we'll share it.

264140	265140	Yeah.
265140	266140	Fuck Steve Huffman.
266140	267940	Everybody just yell, fuck Steve Huffman, and I'll get it.
267940	270300	Is that even his name?
270300	271300	I'm pretty sure it's right.
271300	272300	Don't look it up.
272300	275460	It'd be so good if it wasn't.
275460	280220	Steve Huffman is a Nobel Peace Prize winning philanthropist.
280220	281220	It's Craig.
281220	282220	It's Craig?

287220	288220	Craig!
288220	289220	Thank you, Craig.
289220	290220	Three, two, one...
290220	291220	And it's all my fault!
291220	310220	Today I woke up missing me.
310220	318220	I forgot her yesterday, where I left my made-up enemies, and this song was not a thing.
318220	327900	And the truth is, this is 100% real, cause my life is wonderful, and I blame it on me.
