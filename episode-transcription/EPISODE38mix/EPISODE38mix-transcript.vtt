00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
Hello people in this airplane we call life, it's your captain speaking Wolf the dog, and

00:08.600 --> 00:13.880
I'm here to airdrop some news on y'all while flying drunk.

00:13.880 --> 00:22.880
We are taking over the skies here at 694.2 PTBP the sky kingdoms newest and best and

00:22.880 --> 00:26.180
only radio show.

00:26.180 --> 00:33.300
Look out skybound geese I'm hungry for bird bones and these propellers are awfully sharp.

00:33.300 --> 00:39.180
I've got an announcement here from my producer it seems that a few days ago on the first

00:39.180 --> 00:46.060
of the month the third patreon exclusive episode dropped for all of our honorary police officers.

00:46.060 --> 00:52.900
Joe Luke Taylor Thomas and Zach got together and played a disgusting and delicious game

00:52.900 --> 00:55.280
of the end of the world.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.980
You can hear that as well as our first two bonus episodes, a Q&A session, and a game

01:00.980 --> 01:06.460
of everyone is john by following the link to our patreon in the show notes or going

01:06.460 --> 01:13.860
to patreon.com slash pretending pod and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging 5 bucks

01:13.860 --> 01:17.100
a month to keep the show alive.

01:17.100 --> 01:22.860
Honey might help wolf's bowels but honey right in to help wolf's howls it's howling

01:22.860 --> 01:24.660
with wolf.

01:24.660 --> 01:31.180
This week's howling with wolf comes from at the underdash millennial c who tagged at pretending

01:31.180 --> 01:37.840
pod in an instagram story y'all know how tickled I get when you take time out of your day to

01:37.840 --> 01:40.060
share the show with your friends.

01:40.060 --> 01:41.940
At the millennial c he writes

02:10.060 --> 02:16.500
It dumb, so much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets,

02:16.500 --> 02:26.220
you never know if you don't go, you never shine if you don't glow, y'all wolf rarely

02:26.220 --> 02:31.820
lets his emotions get the best of him but when someone takes the time to write up something

02:31.820 --> 02:39.340
so personal and meaningful it just... stop it wolf, stop licking up my tears, remember

02:39.340 --> 02:44.580
if you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on instagram

02:44.580 --> 02:50.260
or twitter tag pretending to be people on facebook or write a 5 star review and email

02:50.260 --> 02:57.220
us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com fuck all that dumb social media bullshit after

02:57.220 --> 03:04.180
all it only dictates whether wolf gets to eat trash or has to eat trash and wolf has

03:04.180 --> 03:09.060
a distaste for mistakes that dicks fake to get milkshakes.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.900
It's time for the news

03:10.900 --> 03:17.200
Last time, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and Keith Vigna came to the dark mausoleum

03:17.200 --> 03:21.220
of their former co-worker Ari Manstein.

03:21.220 --> 03:26.500
They all had four names burned into their skin, Marvin on their chests, Maggie on the

03:26.500 --> 03:32.580
bottom of their left foot, Drew on the backs, and Tilly on their dominant palms.

03:32.580 --> 03:37.460
Keith Vigna called the number left by Agent Kennedy and he answered a few questions from

03:37.460 --> 03:39.660
an automated voice.

03:39.660 --> 03:43.660
John drove the three of them in Keith's cruiser to Jim Cook's house.

03:43.660 --> 03:48.260
In the neighborhood, every light pole was fitted with a sign warning residents about

03:48.260 --> 03:50.060
Clark Bishop.

03:50.060 --> 03:55.700
In Jim Cook's house, Clark showed his partners the book he found and slowly realized he might

03:55.700 --> 04:01.060
be the overseer that Maggie Cook and the Circle of Knowledge is intent on bringing back.

04:01.060 --> 04:07.340
A slow drip of vodka from the ceiling led the three sort of officers upstairs to search

04:07.380 --> 04:09.300
for a room without a door.

04:09.300 --> 04:14.420
Keith knocked on the wall to avoid kicking a stud and then put his foot right through

04:14.420 --> 04:16.700
the wall in the hallway.

04:16.700 --> 04:21.620
It is December 6th, 3pm, and Keith Vigna has one foot in.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.660
I've got one foot out.

04:23.660 --> 04:33.420
And shaking it all about is kudzu with no backbone.

04:37.340 --> 05:05.500
It's all really funny to me.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.740
There's some really good ones, yeah.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.620
I saw there's like a Zuckerberg one that was like, not verbatim, but basically it's like

05:11.620 --> 05:16.780
he was, he's the one like pushing a bunch of money so that people will go storm area

05:16.780 --> 05:20.700
51 so they can go find his dad.

05:20.700 --> 05:28.660
Oh my god.

05:28.660 --> 05:29.660
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

05:29.660 --> 05:36.900
Alright, so Keith gets pushed through this wall by John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.780
The drywall folds.

05:38.780 --> 05:40.300
Also Midsummer Spoilers.

05:40.300 --> 05:47.260
And Keith Vigna lands on the other side covered in debris and the hole opens up wide enough

05:47.260 --> 05:52.580
for you guys to look in and in this secret room is a small living room set up.

05:52.580 --> 05:59.220
There is a chair with an end table facing a small TV VCR that is sitting on top of a

05:59.220 --> 06:01.660
pile of thick books.

06:01.660 --> 06:07.740
There's a desk with a chair and there is a handle of vodka sideways on the floor next

06:07.740 --> 06:13.420
to the end table poured out onto the rug that barely covers the makeshift floor beneath.

06:13.420 --> 06:18.260
When you say makeshift floor, yeah, I'm picturing that this room is kind of like haphazardly

06:18.260 --> 06:23.060
constructed and therefore the floor is this like plywood.

06:23.060 --> 06:24.060
Like walking.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.060
Just like sitting on the joists.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.060
Yeah.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.700
Like walking through an attic where you only want to walk on the planks.

06:28.700 --> 06:32.780
Yeah, but they've made it so that they can at least like walk around.

06:32.780 --> 06:37.060
Like he's made the, all of the floor load bearing for the most part.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.580
And you said on the TV it's static or?

06:39.580 --> 06:41.900
Yeah, there's static on the TV.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.900
Are there any VCR tapes lying around?

06:44.900 --> 06:47.980
There are no VHS tapes lying around.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.180
What are the books the TV is sitting on?

06:50.180 --> 06:59.740
The books that the TV is sitting on are thick textbooks on radiation and physics and quantum

06:59.740 --> 07:00.980
mechanics.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.260
Just a lot of lofty shit.

07:02.260 --> 07:03.980
A lot of light reading.

07:03.980 --> 07:10.620
The end table or any of the tables, do they have drawers in them?

07:10.620 --> 07:17.900
No, but as you walk in and look further into this room, you see that on the end table there

07:17.900 --> 07:23.900
is a small vial of clear liquid, a scalpel, and a box of tissues.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.060
The vial.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.140
When I pick it up, how heavy is it?

07:27.140 --> 07:29.340
About as heavy as a glass vial should be.

07:29.340 --> 07:32.780
Real fast, now that we're kind of standing in the room, taking a look around, could I

07:32.780 --> 07:36.580
see another way into this room that wouldn't have needed to be knocked through a wall?

07:36.580 --> 07:37.580
Yes.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.580
What do I see?

07:38.580 --> 07:40.500
There's just a small door in the corner of the room.

07:40.500 --> 07:44.060
When you open it up, you kind of see on the other side that it was just a false wall.

07:44.060 --> 07:46.500
So this was a secret room.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.500
This is a hidden room.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.620
So I open that door and I see a wall in front of me and I can push on it to open it?

07:51.620 --> 07:52.620
Yeah.

07:52.620 --> 07:53.620
Got it.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.620
Where do I pop out?

07:54.620 --> 07:55.620
Just in the hallway.

07:55.620 --> 07:56.620
Upstairs.

07:56.620 --> 07:57.620
Okay.

07:57.620 --> 07:58.620
I have this vial in my hand.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.700
I'm like, what do you guys think this is?

08:00.700 --> 08:04.060
I'm not going to taste it, but I haven't opened it up yet.

08:04.060 --> 08:07.900
With all the weird shit we've been dealing with, I feel like if I open this up, two things

08:07.900 --> 08:08.900
could happen.

08:08.900 --> 08:14.600
One, absolutely nothing, and then we wonder what happens, or two, some fucking something

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
crazy is going to happen.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.800
What if you become like a Batman?

08:17.800 --> 08:19.400
I don't want to be like Batman.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.720
I want to, I don't know.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.720
And I opened it up.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
Sorry, I mean a man bat.

08:24.720 --> 08:31.200
As you hold on to the bottom of the vial with one hand, your other hand kind of slowly goes

08:31.200 --> 08:38.240
to grasp around the top of the vial and it's shaking a little bit and slowly twist off

08:38.240 --> 08:42.720
the top with the rubber dropper on top.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.280
As you lift it off, absolutely nothing happens.

08:48.280 --> 08:55.160
As I learned in science class, as Keith Fignan learned in science class, I waft it into my

08:55.160 --> 08:57.160
nose to see if I smell anything.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
I love the wafting.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.600
It's important for science.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.480
That way you don't fall over and die in eighth grade science class.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.280
This liquid seems to be not noxious in any way.

09:09.280 --> 09:14.880
Well, I'm going to screw the lid back on and put that in one of my big old pockets

09:14.880 --> 09:15.880
for now.

09:15.880 --> 09:16.880
Okay.

09:16.880 --> 09:17.880
There was a label on it, was there?

09:17.880 --> 09:18.920
There was no label on it.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.880
Is there anybody else in this room?

09:20.880 --> 09:22.880
Yes, there are.

09:22.880 --> 09:23.880
There's a man standing there.

09:23.880 --> 09:24.880
There's a hundred people wanting to fight you.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.200
Asking you to stop touching his things.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
Please sir.

09:29.200 --> 09:34.400
Can I do a search to see if I see anything else that I didn't just immediately see?

09:34.400 --> 09:40.280
Well, as you guys continue to look around this room, you would notice that on the desk

09:40.280 --> 09:48.060
are three folders and an envelope and the TV VCR itself, there is no antenna on it and

09:48.060 --> 09:49.620
there's no coaxial plugged in.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.720
It's just the power cable.

09:51.720 --> 09:57.760
Hey John, you mentioned a TV in one of your visions.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.760
Is this the TV?

09:58.760 --> 10:01.500
It doesn't seem, no, it doesn't seem like it.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.880
Can I unplug the TV?

10:02.880 --> 10:03.880
Yeah.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.160
When you unplug the TV, the static stops.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.160
Like a TV.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.200
I want to feel inside the VHS slot.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.040
There is a VHS in the TV VCR.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Ooh, eject it please.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.920
I plug the TV back in.

10:17.920 --> 10:25.480
When you plug it in as John Lee Pettymore is clicking eject and a VHS pops out and it

10:25.480 --> 10:31.080
is labeled Bishops WOF.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.840
Stick it in there and see if we can not.

10:32.840 --> 10:37.480
Wait, is the VCR plugged into the TV or is this a TV VCR combo?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
It's a combo baby.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.800
I go and look at that tape.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.260
Is there anything in the WOF that, is it an acronym?

10:43.260 --> 10:45.120
Is it periods between them or capitalized?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.920
All capitalized periods in between.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.120
You guys know what WOF could mean?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
We're about to find out.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.080
Put it back in there, see if it'll hit play.

10:53.080 --> 10:58.760
An episode of Wheel of Fortune, of course.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.760
Well hell man, this must have been where old you was hanging out.

11:01.760 --> 11:06.920
And as the episode begins to play, you meet the contestants.

11:06.920 --> 11:13.160
It's couples week on Wheel of Fortune and one of the set of contestants, Clark Bishop's

11:13.160 --> 11:14.160
parents.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.400
A very young Clark Bishop's parents.

11:18.400 --> 11:22.480
They say that they had just gotten married and they are trying to win money for their

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
honeymoon.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.960
Have I ever seen this before?

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
Nope.

11:25.960 --> 11:31.560
Clark is maybe real sentimental about seeing this and sits in the chair opposite the TV

11:31.560 --> 11:33.280
and watches intently.

11:33.280 --> 11:37.120
John tries to see if there's any more vodka left.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.120
There is some.

11:38.120 --> 11:44.080
You know in the reservoir on a handle where I wouldn't have poured out the spout, there's

11:44.080 --> 11:45.760
that much vodka left.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.000
I take a swig and then pass it to, I offer it to Vigna.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.560
I kind of put my hand up not wanting any of this spilled vodka, but I look at Clark sitting

11:55.560 --> 12:00.720
down and watching this, I'm like, Clark, I know that you like Wheel of Fortune, but is

12:00.720 --> 12:03.840
this really the time to sit down and start watching an episode?

12:03.840 --> 12:06.840
Keith, those are my parents.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.840
I've never seen this before.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.360
Those are my parents on Wheel of Fortune.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.560
That couple right there?

12:12.560 --> 12:18.380
And I look at it and I look at both of them and I look at Clark and I'm like, my God,

12:18.380 --> 12:19.540
those are your parents.

12:19.540 --> 12:20.640
The resemblance is uncanny.

12:20.640 --> 12:25.240
Yeah, I've never seen your parents before, but Jesus Christ, are those not your parents?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.560
Is it canon that my parents look like me?

12:27.560 --> 12:28.560
Oh shit.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.680
You quoted earlier that that might not be the case.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.240
I know I'm adopted.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.240
Do you look like your parents?

12:33.240 --> 12:36.280
I mean, I, yeah, I would say you've always seen it.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.960
I've always seen it.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.800
I want to keep watching the show.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.840
I don't know how to, is there a role I can do to say, is there anything significant to

12:45.840 --> 12:53.600
their play or maybe the puzzles they're doing or anything that would ping for Clark as a

12:53.600 --> 12:55.800
thing that's interesting to note?

12:55.800 --> 12:58.360
Do you want to watch the whole episode or are you just going to fast forward through

12:58.360 --> 13:03.600
trying to catch like what each puzzle is and who solves it and how they do or honestly,

13:03.600 --> 13:08.480
I'll probably watch as much as the boys will let me, what if you just try to fast forward

13:08.480 --> 13:09.480
to your parents' parts?

13:09.480 --> 13:13.640
I think pause and fast forwards have fast forward, but yeah, let's just, let's just

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
fast forward.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.580
I'll just check out my parents' parts anytime they're on camera, push play, you keep going

13:18.580 --> 13:19.580
through.

13:19.580 --> 13:23.840
They seem to be doing quite well, so we'll fast forward until just your parents' parts

13:23.840 --> 13:24.840
and watch that.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.320
Fellas don't mind, I haven't seen this before and it's nice to see them moving around.

13:29.320 --> 13:33.720
Yeah, and it's just weird as fuck that this is happening right now, that those are your

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
parents.

13:34.720 --> 13:39.360
While he is watching it, I'm going to continue searching around this room.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.360
Yeah, absolutely.

13:40.360 --> 13:46.360
So you would notice that there are the three folders and an envelope that are on the desk

13:46.360 --> 13:47.360
that you haven't touched.

13:47.360 --> 13:52.080
Yeah, I would like to open up each of those starting with the first.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.080
Okay.

13:53.320 --> 14:01.240
Alright, so you open up one of the folders and on the inside you see a large stack of

14:01.240 --> 14:02.240
papers.

14:02.240 --> 14:06.200
It is labeled Operation Stapler.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.060
How thick of a stack of papers?

14:08.060 --> 14:09.060
Quite thick.

14:09.060 --> 14:13.860
On the second page, there is a massive logo that you recognize.

14:13.860 --> 14:18.280
It is an M that is made out of four double helices.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.360
Is there an appendices?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.000
What's the thing at the very beginning?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Index.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.600
There is an index at the beginning as well.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.680
So basically the front page says Operation Stapler.

14:28.680 --> 14:34.360
On the second page, it's got the logo of the M with the double helices and under it, with

14:34.360 --> 14:37.720
the same M spelled out, it says Myriad.

14:37.720 --> 14:38.720
Myriad?

14:38.720 --> 14:39.720
M-Y-R-I-A-D.

14:39.720 --> 14:46.200
Can I go to the index and see what the highlights of the paper?

14:46.200 --> 14:47.280
Yeah, absolutely.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.680
So this is basically a program respec.

14:50.680 --> 15:00.560
So this is someone who is going through and rewriting an existing program to create androids.

15:00.560 --> 15:07.420
And the whole respec of this program is to cut down on cost and sell to private companies.

15:07.420 --> 15:14.240
Is there anything in this about cutting costs, of where they cut costs on these androids?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.760
Yeah, pretty much all across the board.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.980
They cut it in staff.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.700
They cut it in research.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.700
They cut it in supplies.

15:23.700 --> 15:24.700
Every aspect.

15:24.700 --> 15:29.220
But not anything that indicates in the new androids, specifically like a certain thing

15:29.220 --> 15:32.020
they really cut costs on?

15:32.020 --> 15:33.020
Nope.

15:33.020 --> 15:34.380
Mostly just an overall cut.

15:34.380 --> 15:38.940
Is there any indication of what private companies they thought they might be able to sell them

15:38.940 --> 15:39.940
to?

15:39.940 --> 15:41.420
There are no indications.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.020
I want to Google Myriad.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.900
Not the word, but the...

15:44.900 --> 15:48.060
When you Google Myriad, go ahead and roll.

15:48.060 --> 15:51.140
Do you have a computers skill of some sort?

15:51.140 --> 15:52.780
Yeah, I have 50 in computer science.

15:52.780 --> 15:53.780
Oh, yeah.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.780
Use that.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.900
69, which is a success.

15:57.900 --> 15:58.900
Oh, it's...

15:58.900 --> 15:59.900
Fuck it, 66.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.900
It's a fucking critical fail.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.900
Critical fail.

16:01.900 --> 16:02.900
Oh, no.

16:02.900 --> 16:06.060
Myself, my smartphone explodes.

16:06.060 --> 16:12.380
Actually looking at your phone, which is the phone that was just in Kevin's clothes.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.380
It's not a smartphone.

16:13.380 --> 16:14.380
All right.

16:14.380 --> 16:15.380
Fuck.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.380
You texted Google.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.380
Cha-cha.

16:17.380 --> 16:18.380
Cha-cha.

16:18.380 --> 16:19.380
What is Myriad?

16:19.380 --> 16:22.380
I'm just trying to remember what that was called.

16:22.380 --> 16:25.380
It just gives the description of the actual word.

16:25.380 --> 16:28.860
Cha-cha was awesome before you could just Google things on your phone.

16:28.860 --> 16:30.420
Cha-cha was awesome.

16:30.420 --> 16:38.340
The screen on your phone wobbles in a very strange way and covers your phone screen before

16:38.340 --> 16:40.300
it just goes back to normal.

16:40.300 --> 16:46.340
Real fast, are androids something in this world that we know about?

16:46.340 --> 16:47.340
Okay.

16:47.340 --> 16:52.260
It's weird how often that you've interacted with them in the past six days for them to

16:52.260 --> 16:59.300
have never been a thing in your life previous, aside from film and television, right?

16:59.300 --> 17:04.140
Which I think maybe we might get copyright stung on this by George Lucas.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.140
Yeah.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.660
The inventor of androids.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.660
He's a go-getter.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.740
I think he's droid, not android.

17:10.740 --> 17:15.020
Clark, as you keep fast forwarding through, your parents are killing it.

17:15.020 --> 17:18.180
They took a commanding lead in the very first puzzle.

17:18.180 --> 17:19.260
They were always good at it.

17:19.260 --> 17:24.580
The second folder on this desk, it's the exact same setup with the papers, and on the front

17:24.580 --> 17:29.220
page it says Operation Hole Puncher.

17:29.220 --> 17:33.940
On the second page, there is the logo for the Circle of Knowledge, and then underneath

17:33.940 --> 17:37.220
it it says Circle of Knowledge.

17:37.220 --> 17:43.400
This one is a smaller paper, and the index is just a list of companies.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.680
Myriad is not on that list?

17:45.680 --> 17:52.680
As you go through them, Myriad is not on the list, and they are mostly non-profits, charities,

17:52.680 --> 17:55.000
think tanks, and universities.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.480
Is it small enough that I could maybe flip through to the first few, maybe like an introductory

17:59.480 --> 18:04.200
page and learn what this is, what it pertains to?

18:04.200 --> 18:12.920
It is a list of companies, and then each page of the company has a date, and an address,

18:12.920 --> 18:14.100
and a phone number.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.480
How many companies are there?

18:15.480 --> 18:16.680
There are hundreds.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.680
Okay.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.560
On to the third folder.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.280
Clark, your parents keep winning.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
They just keep winning.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.960
They're knocking it out of the park.

18:25.960 --> 18:33.560
Both of them have now succeeded at calling out a puzzle, and they make it to the bonus

18:33.560 --> 18:35.600
round, the final round.

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
Final Jeopardy, if you will.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.640
I figured they would.

18:37.640 --> 18:47.960
The third folder on the desk is called Operation Three Ring Binder, and it is empty, but inside

18:47.960 --> 18:55.500
one of the pockets in this folder is this item, and you pull it out, and it is a dirty

18:55.500 --> 18:58.440
dog grooming key fob.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.800
Okay.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.200
Keith has a crazy idea.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.280
He opens up that first folder again.

19:05.280 --> 19:13.600
I slip the ring on my finger, and I press it to the page with the M embossment or image.

19:13.600 --> 19:19.760
As you move your hand closer to this page with the image of the M on it, your hands

19:19.760 --> 19:26.200
start shaking, and you get close, and then you press the ring onto the paper, and nothing

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
happens.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.480
I knew that's what was going to happen, but I wanted to try.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.240
I'd like to open the envelope.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
Okay.

19:35.240 --> 19:42.600
Clark, the bonus round starts, and they put the clue up on, but they don't do the letters

19:42.600 --> 19:45.760
yet, and then the bonus letters come on.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.440
RST, that will mean.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.440
Thank you.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.440
Yeah.

19:49.440 --> 19:57.480
And your mom turns to your dad and says, we're already given the best letters.

19:57.480 --> 20:03.520
They solve the puzzle, and win the prize of the wheel of fortune, and the prize is

20:03.520 --> 20:04.520
a honeymoon.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.520
It may as well be.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.520
They win a honeymoon.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.520
Where do they go?

20:07.520 --> 20:08.520
Branson.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.520
Yep.

20:09.520 --> 20:16.760
It's an all expense paid trip to Branson, Missouri.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.360
Four nights, three days.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.400
That's back in peak Branson, mind you, before Andy Williams die.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.400
Yeah.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
Anyway.

20:25.400 --> 20:35.160
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore goes to the envelope, and I am now handing Thomas an envelope.

20:35.160 --> 20:44.480
Keith looks at John, Kevin, and I'm just hoping that he just reads it out loud.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.480
He doesn't.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.480
What's it say, dude?

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
Hold on.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.560
Oh, cool.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.240
You know the wheel of fortune theme song?

20:56.240 --> 20:57.680
That's Jeopardy, right?

20:57.680 --> 20:58.680
That's Jeopardy.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
Wheel of Fortune.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
I don't know what there's.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.680
That's it.

21:01.680 --> 21:11.640
Wheel of Fortune is mostly like, it's a bunch of the stuff, and there's Wheel of Fortune,

21:11.640 --> 21:13.720
and then it goes into Pat Sajak.

21:13.720 --> 21:14.720
It's wheel.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.360
It's motherfucking Pat Sajak up in this.

21:17.360 --> 21:22.440
Can you just read it out loud though?

21:22.440 --> 21:26.380
It starts with the symbol of the circle of knowledge, and it says faith through knowledge

21:26.380 --> 21:31.720
is just called knowledge, which is the start of Jim Cook's letter disputing the revelations

21:31.720 --> 21:32.720
of the overseer.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.720
All right.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.080
Faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

21:36.080 --> 21:39.920
Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness I write to you.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.320
I fear a change is coming.

21:41.320 --> 21:45.880
I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.240
I have recently grown a tail.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.560
He is not particularly skilled in going unnoticed.

21:50.560 --> 21:55.240
He is an odd little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no chin.

21:55.240 --> 22:00.160
He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose on Marvin Glass.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.160
Stay alert.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.160
Step carefully.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.040
We are being watched, Jim Cook.

22:05.040 --> 22:11.880
And a lot of the letters are either over or underlined.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.400
So I'm just trying to write those out right now.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.800
Round glasses, fat face.

22:15.800 --> 22:16.800
Yeah.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.880
Would that remind me of John Peters?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.640
Didn't he have a round face?

22:20.640 --> 22:24.160
A lot of people have round faces where I come from.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.680
Who was the food guy?

22:26.680 --> 22:28.300
What food guy?

22:28.300 --> 22:29.680
Behind curtain number three.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.680
Harold Dorsey.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
Oh, yeah.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.680
Behind curtain number three.

22:33.680 --> 22:34.680
Behind Dorsey.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.800
Yeah, he was a food critic.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
I don't know.

22:37.800 --> 22:38.800
I guess he could have been lying.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.280
That was just the first thing that popped into my mind.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.840
It probably isn't, but.

22:42.840 --> 22:43.840
Yeah.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.840
Because I looked up his website.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.840
He was a food guy.

22:48.840 --> 22:53.240
I guess he could have maybe stumbled on something and decided to run with it for a Marvin Glass

22:53.240 --> 22:54.240
thing.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.240
Yeah, probably not.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.240
I don't know.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.240
He was following around.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.240
God damn it.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.900
Who was he following around?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.080
He was following.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.320
He was trying to get.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
Maggie Kirk.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320
But why?

23:04.320 --> 23:06.120
Why was he following Maggie?

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Why was he?

23:07.120 --> 23:09.840
Maybe because she's Jim's son and he was following Jim.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.840
But there was a reason.

23:10.840 --> 23:11.840
Well, fuck.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.840
I don't remember.

23:12.840 --> 23:13.840
Probably my notes somewhere.

23:13.840 --> 23:14.840
God damn it.

23:14.840 --> 23:15.840
Okay.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
I can't.

23:16.840 --> 23:17.840
Here's this letter.

23:17.840 --> 23:22.120
I can't make heads or tails of the underlying letters.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.200
I got a Macau a GAC.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.400
Is that anything close?

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
Macau a GAC.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.400
Yeah.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.400
You nailed it.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.400
10 bonus points.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.400
Some of them are overlined.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.400
Some of them are underlined.

23:33.400 --> 23:40.560
I will post a picture of this letter on our Instagram at pretending pod and on our Twitter

23:40.560 --> 23:41.880
at pretending pod.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.920
All right.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.060
So I think I've got to figure it out.

23:45.060 --> 23:50.040
Listening along at home and you want to try yourself, you might want to go to the pretending

23:50.040 --> 23:54.520
to be people Instagram page now and take a look at that letter at pretending pod.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
Hop on there.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.520
Pause this.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.240
See if you can solve it yourself because Thomas is about to break this motherfucker wide open.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.240
All right.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.240
So it's two sets of letters.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.320
What was that about Instagram, John?

24:04.320 --> 24:05.320
I don't know.

24:05.320 --> 24:10.120
I was speaking in tongues.

24:10.160 --> 24:12.320
There's two sets of letters here.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.760
Half of them are overlined and half of them are underlined.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.960
The overlined letters spell out Maggie.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.320
The underlined letters spell out Cook.

24:21.320 --> 24:26.720
I think old Jim was trying to tell us that his daughter Maggie is the, the trader he

24:26.720 --> 24:28.400
suspects is among us.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.600
Will you read, will you read that opening, that part where he, dear keepers, it is with

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
great sadness.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.440
I write to you a fear of change coming.

24:34.440 --> 24:39.160
I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent.

24:39.200 --> 24:44.120
And then he also, he mentioned his, uh, Oh hell, what did we decide his name was?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.400
The reporter, Harold Dorsey, Harold Dorsey.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.320
So I was, I was mulling that over.

24:48.320 --> 24:53.640
I don't remember exactly why he was following Maggie, but he, he came in and told Drew that

24:53.640 --> 24:56.880
he was going over to Maggie's and Drew said, I'd help you in.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.280
Now that I think about it, Keith, Harold Dorsey just ran a blog.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.280
I don't know.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.280
He was old enough.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.880
He could have had a life in journalism before that.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.120
They said he got axed because he was touching a Marvin thing.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.480
Well, let's look into some of the stuff he was writing about before he started talking

25:10.480 --> 25:11.480
about Marvin.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.700
Did he have an interest in the supernatural?

25:13.700 --> 25:20.000
Talking about Harold, I stepped over Harold with Drew's body to pull him out of that exploding

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
building.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.960
Harold was following Maggie.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.600
Just Harold, H A R R E L L.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
Harold?

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
Harold.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.040
Okay, let me start that all over again.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.040
Like a man, Carol?

25:30.040 --> 25:31.880
I thought it was Harold Dorsey.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.880
Yeah, I definitely did too because Harold's not a fucking name.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.120
H A R R E L L.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
I wrote down Harold.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
Hey.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
Okay.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.120
Shit.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.120
Kiss ass.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
We're going to get you.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
Luck, please.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.440
We're going to get you after this podcast, Joe.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.640
Joe gets five luck.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.980
What's that put your luck at now, Joe?

25:56.980 --> 25:58.880
If you're really giving it to me, it makes me 60.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.840
Oh, I'm giving it to you.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.160
I found out the Maggie Cook thing.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.960
It just licked your tain a little bit.

26:05.960 --> 26:12.760
Well, you're really taking a lot of the role play out of this for me.

26:12.760 --> 26:18.500
This has all been an elaborate sexual fantasy for a sec.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
Power fantasy, baby.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.520
Anyway, Harold Dorsey, I stepped over him with Drew's body.

26:21.520 --> 26:26.240
Everything is about sex, except for sex, which is about power.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.600
Harold died in the explosion.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.000
Or was he dead already when he walked in?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
No.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.480
When I walked in, it was Harold and Drew laying next to each other, puke all over the place,

26:36.480 --> 26:40.680
Maggie's foot cut off, James, the mill worker's foot cut off.

26:40.680 --> 26:45.160
I don't know if he's eating it or not, but a plate full of foot meat in front of him,

26:45.160 --> 26:51.160
bullet in his head, tripped some sort of wire, and I had a split second decision to make.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.600
I drug drew out of there.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.260
I stepped over Harold Dorsey's body.

26:57.260 --> 27:02.460
So our theory right now is that Harold Dorsey, turns out, was tailing Jim Cook, and Jim Cook

27:02.460 --> 27:07.180
surmised that he was a disgraced journalist who had been searching for Marvin.

27:07.180 --> 27:09.860
It's kind of two things that are kind of going against each other.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.620
He was fired for writing about Marvin.

27:12.620 --> 27:15.100
Now we know he had a blog, right?

27:15.100 --> 27:17.780
Have we looked into that?

27:17.780 --> 27:23.620
I thought for the most part it was a food blog, because I remember how we found out

27:23.620 --> 27:26.940
about Harold was the Daily Fud.

27:26.940 --> 27:30.460
Maybe he was obsessed with finding out what foot meat tasted like.

27:30.460 --> 27:34.620
But also, I gotta admit, haven't you been wondering?

27:34.620 --> 27:36.660
This just occurred to me.

27:36.660 --> 27:44.700
He was a food writer, and Gary that runs the Daily Fud was following him around, but Gary

27:44.700 --> 27:51.480
also had images that relate back to the circle of knowledge in the Daily Fud.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.700
He had a bunch of photos up, you're right.

27:53.700 --> 28:00.620
I'm trying to think now, was Gary really trying to get a food review out of him, or

28:00.620 --> 28:05.940
was he following him around because of the circle of knowledge or something like that?

28:05.940 --> 28:07.740
Was Gary following him around?

28:07.740 --> 28:11.620
Gary was following Harold around, and Harold was following Maggie.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.740
Well then I have a little theory then.

28:13.740 --> 28:21.200
It seems that Harold might have been an amateur enthusiast in this sort of otherworldly knowledge,

28:21.200 --> 28:24.640
but perhaps he wasn't really accepted by any of these groups.

28:24.640 --> 28:29.400
The circle of knowledge probably didn't let him in, but he had some suspicions, so he's

28:29.400 --> 28:31.720
following these people around.

28:31.720 --> 28:37.360
Maggie's identified as this traitor perhaps in this note, and maybe he got some word of

28:37.360 --> 28:39.500
that and that's why he was following her.

28:39.500 --> 28:44.840
What if you, as another theory, take out the supernatural elements that we've discovered,

28:44.840 --> 28:49.240
and he just found some connection between the cooks and Marvin?

28:49.240 --> 28:50.240
That could be too.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.240
Not bad, actually.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.240
Occam's Razor.

28:52.240 --> 28:56.600
Well, talking about Maggie, and I know we're bringing a lot of stuff up now, but you told

28:56.600 --> 29:05.140
me, us, I suppose, that Maggie inducted you into this circle of knowledge.

29:05.140 --> 29:12.200
If her dad is saying that, I mean, based off this envelope, that Maggie's not to be trusted.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.480
She's gone rogue, perhaps.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.300
What do you think about that?

29:16.300 --> 29:20.900
What do we think about the order that our two Jim Cook's letters were written in?

29:20.900 --> 29:26.220
Do you think that he suspected Maggie and then decided that the circle of knowledge

29:26.220 --> 29:32.260
was full of the writings of a madman, or the scrawlings of a crazed man, or something like

29:32.260 --> 29:34.260
that was in the first letter that we read?

29:34.260 --> 29:37.660
Do you think, so, I'm sorry, do you think one led to the other, and which way do you

29:37.660 --> 29:38.660
think it went?

29:38.660 --> 29:44.720
I'd imagine that one came first, since he quotes his own phrase, faith through knowledge

29:44.720 --> 29:47.920
is just called knowledge, at the start of this letter.

29:47.920 --> 29:52.320
And perhaps his doubts in their book led Maggie to turn against him.

29:52.320 --> 29:56.400
Well, I think the faith through knowledge is just knowledge is a circle of knowledge

29:56.400 --> 29:57.400
slogan.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.500
Maggie said it to me, actually, herself.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.880
That's not a very good slogan.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.680
Maggie said that to me pretty much verbatim.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.960
She was telling me that she knew I had faith, and she needed me to have knowledge.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.400
That's when she showed me that creature I told you about.

30:11.400 --> 30:16.800
So, when I met Maggie, that's who I would be, that's who I would trust, but learning

30:16.800 --> 30:24.540
all this new stuff, if her own father, if we've deciphered this correctly, her own fathers

30:24.540 --> 30:28.880
may be saying that Maggie Cook can't be trusted.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.520
How much trust do you have in Maggie Cook?

30:31.520 --> 30:32.520
She's the chief, Keith.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.560
I've always trusted her with my life, but the chief died.

30:35.560 --> 30:36.560
We don't even know the focus Maggie Cook is.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.680
I saw Maggie Cook, I don't even know what I saw.

30:39.680 --> 30:45.520
I saw Maggie Cook dead, but you're saying that you saw her alive, and she inducted you

30:45.520 --> 30:51.560
into this thing, and now I've got this letter telling us that she is not to be trusted.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.920
What do we do about this?

30:52.920 --> 30:56.540
Here's the thing is that whether or not she can be trusted, should be trusted, whether

30:56.540 --> 31:01.880
it's her or not, the thing she showed me was real as day in my eyes.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.880
I saw the thing.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.520
It scared the daylights out of me.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.000
But what if she's not showing you the whole truth?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.880
They're only telling you part of her plans.

31:08.880 --> 31:15.520
I'm just saying, if she's telling me that she wants to stop the thing, I would want

31:15.520 --> 31:16.520
to stop the thing.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.720
So, I mean, I guess she could be lying about wanting to stop it?

31:19.720 --> 31:20.720
Well...

31:20.720 --> 31:21.720
I don't know.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.160
I want to stop the thing, fellas.

31:23.160 --> 31:24.640
I agree with that as well.

31:24.640 --> 31:33.560
I mean, we gotta stop the thing, and we can figure out all this, where any alliances lie

31:33.560 --> 31:37.680
later on, but I think at the end of the day we gotta stop, you know, whatever's going

31:37.680 --> 31:38.680
on.

31:38.840 --> 31:43.080
I think Marvin Glass is our biggest problem at this point right now.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.360
Well, he's our most addressable problem.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.360
Exactly, John.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.760
It's something we can do.

31:47.760 --> 31:53.160
Well, and it's something that basically my alliance lies with him at basically blackmailing

31:53.160 --> 31:55.600
me into being his ally.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.480
You've just incurred a debt to him.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.480
Right.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.960
Well, and Kevin John, I mean, what's...

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
I don't have any loyalty to him, but...

32:02.960 --> 32:08.640
And neither do you, so I think this is who we should be focusing on right now, and I

32:08.640 --> 32:12.960
think we gotta head that way, and I still like our original plan that...

32:12.960 --> 32:16.560
Is there any more documents in this room?

32:16.560 --> 32:20.920
I'll tell you what Clark is wondering about, and so maybe he'll rifle through papers.

32:20.920 --> 32:25.140
Can he find a connection between Jim and or Maggie to Marvin?

32:25.140 --> 32:29.320
The only connection that you would be able to find in this room has already been laid

32:29.320 --> 32:36.680
out, which is a folder that is labeled Operation Three Ring Binder, and has a dirty dog grooming

32:36.680 --> 32:38.600
key fob inside of it.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.760
Didn't Maggie have one of those?

32:39.760 --> 32:40.760
I don't know.

32:40.760 --> 32:41.760
Just John Peters.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.000
How do we reckon that that's a connection?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.320
Oh, I was just giving you a connection between this room and Marvin Glass.

32:46.320 --> 32:47.320
Yeah.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.760
Well, we're operating under the assumption that this room was Old Me's room, right?

32:50.760 --> 32:51.760
Isn't that what we...

32:51.760 --> 32:52.760
That's what I'm thinking.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.560
Or it'd be pretty weird if it wasn't.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.640
So he was collecting stuff about Jim Cook.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.760
No, he wasn't.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.920
He's living in Jim Cook's house.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.920
He's just living in his house.

32:59.920 --> 33:00.920
You're right.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.400
It's probably a letter Jim Cook wrote to him, maybe, if he's part of the survey.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.720
Boy, what the fuck?

33:10.720 --> 33:12.120
Seconded.

33:12.120 --> 33:18.840
Keith walks out the Keith-shaped hole in the wall and says, come on, boys.

33:18.840 --> 33:19.840
Let's go.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.840
Let's go to Marvin's.

33:20.840 --> 33:21.940
This hole was made for me.

33:21.940 --> 33:22.940
Let's go to the glass.

33:22.940 --> 33:24.200
Let's go to the glass.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.420
Let's do our plan.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.000
We have a lot of new information.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.320
There's nothing else that tells me we shouldn't just do this.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.320
Do what exactly?

33:32.320 --> 33:33.460
Do we have a...

33:33.460 --> 33:34.520
We're going to Chewbacca you.

33:34.520 --> 33:35.920
We're going to Chewbacca you.

33:35.920 --> 33:36.920
We're going to...

33:36.920 --> 33:37.920
But then what?

33:38.240 --> 33:39.720
Oh, then we're going to probably kill everybody.

33:39.720 --> 33:44.880
Yeah, I think we're going to have to have a shootout.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.080
So maybe before we go to...

33:48.080 --> 33:50.320
Well, what are we armed with now?

33:50.320 --> 33:55.020
I got my small, powerful gun, but I've just got my service pistol.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.240
Can we hit up a gun store in the city?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.240
Yeah, for sure.

33:58.240 --> 34:03.480
When you guys go downstairs, you would see we had those items sitting out on the kitchen

34:03.480 --> 34:04.480
counter.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.960
Make sure that we got that all accounted for.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.180
The leather holster was grabbed by Jon.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.380
The ring was grabbed by Keith.

34:12.380 --> 34:16.520
Which is around a shoestring on my neck.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.520
Absolutely.

34:17.520 --> 34:18.640
One pube still hanging on.

34:18.640 --> 34:25.660
And there is a Ziploc bag containing the single tarot card of the devil with several bullet

34:25.660 --> 34:29.300
holes in it and a taxidermied baby squirrel.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.840
And as you guys are re-looking over all this, you would notice now that you've seen Clark's

34:33.840 --> 34:38.840
parents when they were young on the TV, you would recognize that there is a picture of

34:38.840 --> 34:42.360
them on the fridge with Jim Cook.

34:42.360 --> 34:47.160
They are posing with silly hats and Jim Cook is begrudgingly smiling.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.680
Does that mean anything to you, Clark?

34:49.680 --> 34:50.680
What?

34:50.680 --> 34:51.680
This picture.

34:51.680 --> 34:52.680
Oh yeah.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.160
I didn't know that they knew each other.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.080
No, I'd never seen that picture before.

34:56.080 --> 35:02.320
Do you think that maybe they had... that maybe your parents weren't just Wheel of Fortune

35:02.320 --> 35:03.320
players?

35:03.320 --> 35:08.200
Maybe, I don't know, maybe we may all be connected in this somehow.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.240
I just, yeah, I just don't know.

35:11.240 --> 35:14.560
Seeing that picture on there, I just was surprised that they knew each other.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.640
I just kind of thought it was neat.

35:16.640 --> 35:21.160
It helped me believe that I was on the good side when Maggie showed up.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.160
That's for sure.

35:22.160 --> 35:26.520
My parents, it was nice to see the parents smiling once again.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.120
Clark, did you grab that VHS tape?

35:29.120 --> 35:30.120
I did not.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.120
Okay.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.120
I finished it though, right?

35:32.120 --> 35:33.120
I saw everything that was on it.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.120
Yeah.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.520
Was there anything in it?

35:35.520 --> 35:42.220
There's nothing like in the episode or anything that sparked any imagination there, but other

35:42.220 --> 35:44.640
than just, you know, seeing your parents.

35:44.640 --> 35:52.560
But you would notice when you looked at the tape itself, it has been played so many times.

35:52.560 --> 35:56.520
That just made me sad.

35:56.520 --> 35:58.940
Right on.

35:58.940 --> 36:05.300
Maybe even like lifetimes of playing over and over again.

36:05.300 --> 36:12.960
If we pretend that this baby squirrel is for sure from Julie Maxwell, does that mean anything?

36:12.960 --> 36:17.140
Does that change anything for anybody or mean anything for anybody, if we take it as fact?

36:17.140 --> 36:21.460
When I saw attacks at everything, I thought of Julie Maxwell, but it didn't really ping

36:21.460 --> 36:22.900
anything in my brain.

36:22.900 --> 36:26.180
Have we had any indication that she was in the circle of knowledge?

36:26.180 --> 36:28.700
Was she in the circle of knowledge?

36:28.700 --> 36:29.700
I don't...

36:29.700 --> 36:30.700
Well, here's another thing.

36:30.700 --> 36:31.700
I don't think so.

36:31.700 --> 36:36.460
Speaking about that baby squirrel bag, that devil card, the devil tarot card, there was

36:36.460 --> 36:41.460
a file at Marvin Glass's plates labeled Satan.

36:41.460 --> 36:48.620
And all that was in it was a picture of a woman with short curly hair, shoulder length

36:48.620 --> 36:54.620
maybe, and a mouth that took up half her face with a look of unbridled pleasure on it.

36:54.620 --> 36:55.620
Did you know her?

36:55.620 --> 36:56.620
No.

36:57.300 --> 37:00.620
But I remember she had a big mouth because that's one of my favorite Netflix original

37:00.620 --> 37:03.540
series.

37:03.540 --> 37:11.740
It really gets to the heart of the torrid storm that rages in a young person's heart

37:11.740 --> 37:14.100
and mind as they go through adolescence.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.780
It gets to the hard on of the matter.

37:15.780 --> 37:18.300
Yeah, there's a lot of boner stuff too.

37:18.300 --> 37:23.500
Surprisingly, Keith Vigna does not like that television show.

37:23.500 --> 37:24.500
You don't like Vigna?

37:24.500 --> 37:25.500
Not really.

37:26.500 --> 37:30.420
Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit.

37:30.420 --> 37:35.340
It's like the only good show about middle school ever.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.260
So devil, Satan, shot, tarot card...

37:38.260 --> 37:41.660
Hold on, that just pisses me off because it makes me feel like you had a really chill

37:41.660 --> 37:44.540
and easy adolescence.

37:44.540 --> 37:46.740
I don't want to talk on this right now.

37:46.740 --> 37:47.740
I want to keep playing the game.

37:47.740 --> 37:48.740
I do want to talk on this.

37:48.740 --> 37:49.740
I don't.

37:49.740 --> 37:50.740
We can talk about it later.

37:50.740 --> 37:51.740
How was your 8th grade just like really nice?

37:51.740 --> 37:52.740
I just want to play the game.

37:52.740 --> 37:53.740
I want to play the game.

37:53.740 --> 37:54.740
Fuck you.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.980
Luke never went through an awkward phase.

37:59.980 --> 38:01.980
Why are you funny?

38:01.980 --> 38:05.580
I just want to focus on what we're doing right now.

38:05.580 --> 38:07.780
I'm into it.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.620
Devil card with bullet holes through it.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.980
You saw a Satan file.

38:10.980 --> 38:13.500
I mean, I don't know what that means.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.660
Well, it's just the last time I saw something, you know, tangentially related to the devil.

38:17.660 --> 38:18.660
So I thought I'd bring it up.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.660
Gotcha.

38:19.660 --> 38:22.540
Seems like maybe both sides of this are eyeing someone.

38:22.540 --> 38:23.540
Hail Satan.

38:23.540 --> 38:24.540
That they, yeah.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.340
Can I inspect the card a little more?

38:26.340 --> 38:28.580
Is there anything else I can glean from it that maybe I missed?

38:28.580 --> 38:35.940
As you pull the card out of the bag, your fingers go over each ridge where the bullet

38:35.940 --> 38:42.100
holes have struck through it and you feel the ridges and you look at the card and it

38:42.100 --> 38:47.340
is a tarot card with bullet holes in it.

38:47.340 --> 38:51.020
Got me again.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.540
Those two things are on my person.

38:52.540 --> 38:56.980
Oh, so back to my hypothetical, does, does Jim Cook owning a thing that Julie Maxwell

38:56.980 --> 38:59.100
might have made change anything for anybody?

38:59.100 --> 39:00.100
No.

39:00.100 --> 39:04.380
I mean, nothing actually connect indicates that they knew each other, but maybe I can't

39:04.380 --> 39:05.380
think of anything.

39:05.380 --> 39:06.380
All right.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.140
I pocket that bag with the contents inside.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.140
Okay.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.140
Boys.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.100
I'm about to storm the gates.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.700
You want to go?

39:13.700 --> 39:25.460
I mean, we had a arm ourselves and, uh, I think we play it by ear once we get inside.

39:25.460 --> 39:31.220
I mean, we, we got our, we got our, we got our, our idea of getting into the depths of

39:31.220 --> 39:37.260
Marvin glasses compound, but once we get in there, Clark, you're probably not going to

39:37.260 --> 39:38.260
be armed.

39:38.260 --> 39:42.300
Cause I mean, unless, unless there's something that you can hide away, cause you're our,

39:42.300 --> 39:45.740
you're going to be our, our, we drag them in there.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.020
He can be loaded to the teeth.

39:47.020 --> 39:51.800
I mean, the second we reveal our, our deception, he starts firing too.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.440
So I think you should be as secretly armed as you can.

39:55.440 --> 39:59.660
But if they disagree, I mean, it should be hidden, but it's not like we should send them

39:59.660 --> 40:00.660
in lightly armed.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.280
No, no, I don't think so either.

40:02.280 --> 40:06.420
But at the end of the day, you, you may be unarmed.

40:06.420 --> 40:07.660
You won't be unarmed Clark.

40:07.660 --> 40:08.660
Don't worry.

40:08.660 --> 40:11.980
I'm going to fucking, but that's what I'm saying.

40:11.980 --> 40:16.020
That's what I'm, I'm just preparing for the worst is you get stripped of your arms.

40:16.020 --> 40:17.460
We are armed up enough.

40:17.460 --> 40:20.820
We throw you something, but we're going to have to fight our way out of the middle of

40:20.820 --> 40:24.600
what I'm saying, man, is the second anybody comes at him to like search him.

40:24.600 --> 40:25.640
That's when we start shooting.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.940
I don't think so.

40:26.940 --> 40:29.660
I think we get all the way to Martin glass until we start shooting.

40:29.660 --> 40:30.660
Yeah.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.820
If it's, if they frisk us at the front door, I don't think we're not going to start shooting

40:32.820 --> 40:33.820
through the front door.

40:33.820 --> 40:36.540
We're going to wait till we get to our pass a speech check or something.

40:36.540 --> 40:39.220
Again, we can come to it when we come to it.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.220
Okay.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.020
Preparing you preparing for the worst.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.020
That's all I'm saying.

40:43.020 --> 40:44.020
I think you worry too much.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.020
I'll put a, the world's going to hell.

40:45.020 --> 40:48.740
I'll put a, man, John actually kind of a group of Keith on this one.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.940
If they frisk us and I've got guns on me, if they're going to ask why you didn't take

40:51.940 --> 40:53.860
them, we just kill those guys at the door.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.140
I don't like, no.

40:55.140 --> 40:57.340
And then we start a shootout and we don't win it.

40:57.340 --> 40:59.100
I think we need to get all the way.

40:59.100 --> 41:02.580
I think we get all the way to Martin glass before we do anything.

41:02.580 --> 41:07.540
We throw a couple of guns to him at the end of the day because they frisk him.

41:07.580 --> 41:13.220
They look at us and they, I mean, they trust us enough, but not more than they trust anybody

41:13.220 --> 41:14.340
else that works there.

41:14.340 --> 41:17.280
So I'm thinking he goes in unarmed.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.200
We go in real armed.

41:19.200 --> 41:23.460
If they ask us why we got arms on us, then we say, cause we got this guy.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.880
He's he's not armed, but he's dangerous.

41:25.880 --> 41:29.780
The other members of the glass family or his henchmen or whatever, does everybody know

41:29.780 --> 41:34.020
that you're John Lee Pettymore in Kevin's body or that no one knows that.

41:34.020 --> 41:38.980
So you, it seemed when we were up in our cages, had a kind of the run of the thing.

41:38.980 --> 41:39.980
Exactly.

41:39.980 --> 41:40.980
You're like captain to him.

41:40.980 --> 41:41.980
Yeah.

41:41.980 --> 41:44.700
I'm way higher up than new Charles.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.180
I think they're going to trust me.

41:46.180 --> 41:49.740
And the only exception is if Rosemary has come back and she thinks we're working against

41:49.740 --> 41:53.620
them now, which that might make it hard to get in in the first place.

41:53.620 --> 41:57.120
But I think we can bullshit our way past anybody trying to frisk you.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.120
You can throw it.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.120
Yeah.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.120
You could throw your perceived weight around.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
Exactly.

42:01.220 --> 42:05.160
If they, you know, if they find the guns on you, we just say, we're getting you here in

42:05.160 --> 42:09.060
a hurry and thanks for finding them and taking them off of them and we'll collect them and

42:09.060 --> 42:10.060
move on.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.060
I agree.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.060
Okay.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.060
I'm good with that.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.060
Let's go buy some guns.

42:14.060 --> 42:15.060
Let's head over to the glass compound.

42:15.060 --> 42:16.060
What's that?

42:16.060 --> 42:17.060
The gun store first.

42:17.060 --> 42:18.060
The gun store.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.060
The gun store, I mean.

42:19.060 --> 42:20.060
And then the glass compound.

42:20.060 --> 42:30.260
Welcome to large Eddie's gun emporium.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.720
What's the largest gun you got?

42:31.720 --> 42:32.720
Large Eddie.

42:32.720 --> 42:33.720
Oh, this one right here.

42:33.720 --> 42:37.040
It's the, it's the cutter in half.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.040
Cutter in half?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.840
Barely newer in half.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.840
I step up to the counter.

42:42.840 --> 42:48.960
I've got my only gun on me is my large and powerful gun, but I'd like to have like a,

42:48.960 --> 42:53.920
like an assault rifle on me, like military fully auto assault rifle.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.000
I want to purchase one of those.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Okay.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.800
Do you have a money?

42:58.800 --> 42:59.800
I.

43:00.340 --> 43:03.220
I've got a, I've got a Marvin glass company card.

43:03.220 --> 43:04.220
Yeah.

43:04.220 --> 43:05.220
Well, we're okay.

43:05.220 --> 43:11.060
I've got the credit card in my wallet as a, as John Lee Pettymore says that the guy, his

43:11.060 --> 43:16.420
ears kind of perk up and he's like, Oh, uh, actually if you guys want to come on back

43:16.420 --> 43:19.420
here and he, uh, kicks the back door open.

43:19.420 --> 43:20.420
Thank you.

43:20.420 --> 43:21.420
Large Eddie.

43:21.420 --> 43:27.940
You guys walk into the back room and it is right into his trap.

43:27.940 --> 43:33.040
It's literally, it's just a trap door.

43:33.040 --> 43:39.460
Next week on pretending to be people, it's just us falling for 30 minutes, spy kids.

43:39.460 --> 43:41.160
They're going to talk about what to do next.

43:41.160 --> 43:49.080
Uh, as they're falling, you guys walk back into a room that is a plethora of a madman's

43:49.080 --> 43:50.080
dreams.

43:50.080 --> 43:55.080
What kind of guns do does Keith, does Keith see that he, that he likes?

43:55.080 --> 43:59.820
I don't know anything about guns, but it's all the cool ones.

43:59.820 --> 44:02.480
You get big ones and small ones, red ones and blue ones.

44:02.480 --> 44:06.820
There's some with cool sights on them and others have silencers and there's some big

44:06.820 --> 44:07.820
ones.

44:07.820 --> 44:08.820
There's some shotguns.

44:08.820 --> 44:16.300
So Keith, Keith eyes, a large submachine gun and it's kind of glowing and I stepped up

44:16.300 --> 44:17.900
to that one and I touch it.

44:17.900 --> 44:22.340
It's kind of like cold to the touch and I asked big Eddie, what's this one?

44:22.340 --> 44:23.580
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.

44:23.580 --> 44:28.480
And he flips a switch and turns off the light that's right behind it.

44:28.480 --> 44:31.160
And he's like, oh, it's just, that's just a real big gun.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.080
That's a nice cold gun.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.760
Cold fusion gun.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.040
It works in cold weather.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.100
Is it, is it a fusion?

44:40.100 --> 44:41.100
Is it a fusion?

44:41.100 --> 44:42.100
Good.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.100
No, it just means it works good in cold.

44:43.100 --> 44:46.540
It's the cold fusion brand firearm.

44:46.540 --> 44:48.040
You never heard of cold fusion?

44:48.040 --> 44:51.640
The most murderous pieces this side of the Mississippi.

44:51.640 --> 44:53.120
Capital C, capital F.

44:53.120 --> 44:58.540
I pick it up and it's about a, it's like a two ARs combined into each other.

44:58.540 --> 44:59.540
Fully out.

44:59.540 --> 45:04.660
Oh, I pick it up, throw it on his card and I sling it across my back because it's already

45:04.660 --> 45:07.380
got a leather strap on it.

45:07.380 --> 45:08.380
Ooh, that's nice.

45:08.380 --> 45:10.900
I want to grab just a few pistols.

45:10.900 --> 45:11.900
You grab a few pistols.

45:11.900 --> 45:15.620
You got him tucked into the waistband and maybe one in the boot, one in the butt, one

45:15.620 --> 45:16.620
in the boot.

45:17.120 --> 45:23.880
I want to grab a powerful pistol with a, with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.

45:23.880 --> 45:29.600
You grab the two of those large Eddie bows in reverence and you all leave.

45:29.600 --> 45:34.600
Before we leave your gun emporium, do you have any, any smoke grenades, regular grenades,

45:34.600 --> 45:35.600
flash bangs?

45:35.600 --> 45:36.600
Yeah.

45:36.600 --> 45:40.200
I'd like two of each for all my friends and me.

45:40.200 --> 45:44.440
Two of each for all your friends, smoke, flash, and bang.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.440
What are the?

45:46.440 --> 45:55.820
Smoke, flash, bang, and regular fragmentation, original, original recipe.

45:55.820 --> 45:56.820
Original flavor.

45:56.820 --> 45:57.820
Yeah.

45:57.820 --> 45:58.820
All right.

45:58.820 --> 46:04.140
How are you guys approaching this concept to get into the glass?

46:04.140 --> 46:09.540
That is, I think we go right into the front wherever.

46:09.540 --> 46:10.540
Yeah.

46:10.540 --> 46:15.820
So I know pretty well how to get us through there if we go in through the den of sin through

46:15.820 --> 46:18.480
the dirty dog room and uh, the street access.

46:18.480 --> 46:19.480
Okay.

46:19.480 --> 46:24.160
So I, I think I can sneak us pretty deep into this place if we, uh, so we wouldn't even

46:24.160 --> 46:26.640
have to like meet some folks at the front door.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.680
I like that idea.

46:27.680 --> 46:33.180
And then we can walk in there and as soon as we do, as soon as we meet any kind of resistance,

46:33.180 --> 46:36.820
we just say, Hey, we're taking this man personally to see Marvin Glass.

46:36.820 --> 46:41.920
He murdered, uh, not to be the broken record here, but then what say we get all the way

46:41.920 --> 46:43.320
straight to Marvin.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.240
We shoot our way out.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.300
We kind of want to talk them a little bit, don't we?

46:48.300 --> 46:51.980
I mean, yeah, we just got to prove that we can kill the people protecting him.

46:51.980 --> 46:59.020
So we might have to do that, but I honestly, there's like a, there's probably a 66% chance

46:59.020 --> 47:03.180
that this ends in our glorious deaths.

47:03.180 --> 47:05.860
I'll take the 34.

47:05.860 --> 47:08.860
You think it's that high that we, well, I think here's the deal.

47:08.860 --> 47:12.300
We, we have a shoe that we don't kill Marvin Glass.

47:12.300 --> 47:14.280
We shoot everybody around him.

47:14.280 --> 47:18.120
If we got to shoot him, we injure him, but we talked to him.

47:18.120 --> 47:19.120
Maybe he's valuable.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.120
Maybe he's not.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
We kill him.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.760
We shoot our way out or sneak our way out and then we head straight to contention.

47:24.760 --> 47:25.760
It's what I think.

47:25.760 --> 47:26.760
Try to find Drew.

47:26.760 --> 47:31.960
You guys are discussing this as you drive into the heart of the city where John Lee

47:31.960 --> 47:39.000
Pettymore knows the alleyway in order to get in to the den of sin and the three of you

47:39.000 --> 47:45.600
strapped up exactly how you want to be prepared for what you're diving into.

47:45.600 --> 47:51.700
You go and step on this large grate on the ground in this alleyway.

47:51.700 --> 47:57.300
John Lee Pettymore pulls the dirty dog grooming key fob out of his hand and lifts it up.

47:57.300 --> 48:02.100
And with that, the three of you do fall through a trap door and begin falling.
