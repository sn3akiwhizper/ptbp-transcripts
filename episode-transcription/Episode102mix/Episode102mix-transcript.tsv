108440	112720	Go ahead click right now and peruse while I read the news
113480	119680	Last time not much happened the three leads of this absurd production fell
119960	126820	Upwards into an impossibly dark and equally vibrant nothingness all while witnessing
127640	132920	unnatural visions of scenes that were are or will be played out
133600	138160	Involving themselves in either this or a different timeline
138400	143040	They landed in a world made of this same wild texture
143240	147760	But the ground was made of pure light as that setting faded
147760	154080	They found themselves in a junk filled room with Leo piston before the uber driver spud
154800	162280	exited without watching his footing and fell out of this elevated room to his abrupt demise of swift
162880	169640	smothering of the shimmering silver sea a boat approached that held two figures one a
169960	177760	Ferryman in overalls a beanie in a big white beard and the other was John's uncle Don D. Pettymore
178960	185120	I've been wolf. That was the news. I could use something heavy and dripping in sin
185240	189640	It's dragon in three with what kind of world are you living in?
192280	200280	Bad girls on top of the water
200280	204280	Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline
204280	208280	Leaving my mind at your altar
208280	212280	Crossing the double line, doing it every time
212280	218280	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
219280	227280	What kind of world are you living in?
230280	236880	So we had the same dare officer all through like middle school and then into junior high and then into high school
236880	241720	He was like our police officer that worked at our school and then in high school freshman year
241720	244040	He came to our health class to teach sex ed
244200	250400	It was a in the time where you had those cell phones that were like flip phones and you could set them to a
251040	254320	setting that was vibrate then ring and
254960	259760	So his phone starts vibrating in class as he's teaching and he looks down and he goes
259760	264400	Oh, it's just my wife and he clicks the button or he tries to and so he thinks he's turned it off
264920	270740	But then the ringtone starts and it was like wow. You're a crazy bitch watch your fuck so good
274320	276320	And buck cherry played and
277400	282680	Nice, not sure I ever recovered buck cherry played here in Springfield and the guitarist
283200	285800	shopped at our local music place Hoover and
286240	290600	bought the exact guitar that my guitarist was saving up for
292080	295120	He was in the store at the same time and watched him walk out with it
297960	299960	Really sucked
300240	308040	When you say you've never recovered from that like you mean that was the moment that set what you wanted to be in life or
309240	314660	Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was just like man. There's not there's not much that's better than that, huh?
317760	319480	Yeah, I
319480	325000	Don't know how we how we get back. Oh, I guess we just start the I guess we just start yeah
325000	327760	For once we could just have an episode start with us playing
330840	332840	Oh
332880	337840	No, we kind of do the Dragon Ball Z thing where like you think it's gonna fill up the whole time slot
337840	341480	but then it's like short and half of it is recap and then fucking around I
344400	347680	Thought you meant that we were just dragging our balls same thing
349400	353180	Well instead of dragging our balls, let's get some oopsies out of the way
353180	357640	I've got some whoopsies to whoopsies to be exact to start out with
358280	362240	First whoopsie what you guys woke up in the mausoleum and
363080	365080	You've been through some shit
365480	372400	Especially this time. You've definitely been around lots of unnatural learn lots about the unnatural and
373240	374920	Every time that's happened so far
374920	381240	We've changed the entire nature of the role-playing game that we're playing by having you guys roll to d20 for a natural
381580	385240	And adding that to your skill point so I need
385920	391040	Joe Thomas Luke to roll to d20 for a natural and
392600	397920	Justin hi, I assume that on your character sheet your unnatural score is at a zero no
397920	403080	It's it's quite high actually. Oh good. That is what did we talk about that? Mm-hmm
403920	409360	Okay, good a rest of you might get some real high numbers here. So let's hear those 2d 20 rolls
410080	415480	29 total for me 29 total. Okay. So what does that put your total at? That's a good question
416680	423360	That's why I asked it. I love asking good questions. Okay, I have 79 now Jesus
424080	426080	fucking Christ
426360	429640	Yeah, I'd smoke that guy's cum cool
433200	435200	And Joe
436200	438200	I
438240	445800	Rolled back-to-back sevens, so that's that's a 14 added to my head 49. I think so. I'm at 63
445800	451600	No, that's really really high for an unnatural score and Thomas speaking of 14
451600	457720	I rolled a 14 and a 9 which is 23 added to my previous score that gives me 67
458120	460120	Nice, we're all good at unnatural
461080	463320	Zach's like, why did I give them 2d 20?
463320	468900	Nah, you know this is we're in the um, I know that you guys aren't fans of quality film
469120	472380	But I believe they call this the end game. I
474320	479000	Hate myself and so you guys are going to have a lot of
480040	487880	Natural skill points Luke is a member of the moxie our local independent theater, which means that according to his contract
487880	490140	He's not allowed to watch Marvel movies
491440	493440	Hill's films have
494080	496080	climaxes and dinner moves
497200	502860	Badass shit like end games Luke likes to go to the cinema. We like to go to the right. Yeah
504940	510860	Cinema yeah, okay. I enjoy kenel. I only watch movies where the women have armpit hair
515200	517200	It's kind of my dating policy
517960	520160	Oh, you guys have a lot of unnatural
520520	526760	Yeah, we do at this point and you can use those whenever you want to do things that are unnatural
527680	535240	Wasn't there a big downside to it if we if we oh, yeah. Yep, if you fail, it'll it'll be real bad
538400	539680	No
539680	542060	When you when you are dealing in the unnatural
542840	544520	Things don't always
544520	550120	Go the way you planned and when they go awry the true horror being involved with this
550380	554520	This nature of items or beliefs or thoughts or words
555080	560080	Can really come back and bite you in the little butt come in the butt
561260	563260	cool
564200	571260	So if you were wanting to do something that you didn't think was humanly possible we could roll that skill to see if it happens
571380	573380	I want to eat a million sandwiches
576620	582080	Natural doesn't seem humanly possible. I want to see sandwiches. Yeah
585020	587020	Okay, so with all that
588420	593380	Unnatural business out of the way. I need Justin Luke and Thomas to remove their headphones
594820	599340	Hi, I thought this might be the other oopsie
599980	606720	You almost got away with it almost snuck one right past yo dungeon master
608420	610920	It's time for you to roll for a mania
612700	616820	Cuz I hit my breaking point you remember what it was it made me hit it was
617220	624780	when you saw a giant wave of black ooze that was about to pour down over the
625780	628860	Vw bug or not bug the van that you were in
629780	631900	23 92 89 Oh
632740	634260	23 Michael Jordan
634260	639680	Cardo koi card cart card a coif these hmm an uncontrollable
640200	647180	Compulsion to see maps everywhere to see what the fuck does that mean a compulsion to see maps?
648340	650800	So like you think everything is a map
651800	656240	That means we have to go this way maybe I could be kind of fun that could be fun
656240	661240	I just read it. I just read a Dan Brown book, so I'm kind of hip to seeing maps and shit
663160	664960	Angels and demons
664960	668040	Actually, it was the lost symbol is the one I read. Oh, I don't know
668040	674560	Those are the only two things that I know about Dan Brown is that he wrote those two books and he's played by Tom Hanks
674560	676280	in real life
676720	680800	Rolled up 23. What else did you roll a 92 92 the year I was born
682000	684560	technomania an obsession with new technology
686880	694280	Okay, and finally 89 89 in the year someone else was born me yeah, that's what I thought oh
697960	699960	Scribble o mania
700080	705120	obsession with scribbling or doodling so maps everywhere
705920	709420	Obsession with new technology or obsession with scribbling
710200	714720	Doodling do I have anything on my person that I could scribble with at this point. Oh, you know
716000	718620	Yeah, I think I've whipped out a notepad a few times. Oh, yeah
719400	723280	Notepad pain I'm between maps and notepad. What do you what do you think?
723280	727640	Do you do you have a narrative one that would help you? I think both would be excellent
727640	729640	I will say two things one
729920	734840	We have had a virus of sorts in this show before where?
735720	737400	scribbling was
737400	744120	Happened by the people who had it and I think that would be narratively interesting because if you start scribbling stuff constantly
744120	749000	I think the other PCs will think there's something wrong with you, which could be interesting and
749600	757120	Then I think the map could be narratively interesting as well because you are currently looking for a way out of this place
757400	763720	So that would lead you very easily to play out that one. Fuck. They're both good
763960	767040	Well, I can see how I could play both of them. I'm gonna go
768240	770240	I'm gonna go I
770500	775880	Think I'm gonna go fuck shit. I'm gonna go see maps. I'm gonna go see maps. Okay. Yeah that see maps
776400	778840	on this on the shimmering silver see
780800	783800	All right, let's get the boys back in here with Matt man
784520	786520	My man
788240	795160	Birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie eagle albatross par birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie
795160	798280	bogey double bogey triple bogey, they really ran out of
799400	804880	Ideas for bad golfing pretty quickly. They came up with such cool names for good golfing
804880	811480	And then I've just remembered who I'm talking to but Zach. This is a great point. We know the golfing things
811480	819160	We know those days. Yeah eagle. We just don't know what happens when you go to a golf course and like talk to the lady
820240	827080	Yeah, for those of you who are not a citizen of contention over on patreon.com slash. Oh, yeah
827080	829080	This didn't happen on the mainstream
829320	829840	No
829840	833280	It's not we recently had it at a game where these boys had to
833440	838040	Had to meet for a delta green mission on a golf course and they didn't know what the fuck to do
838040	844760	I I feel like I feel like in real life people would have been a lot more helpful than Zach was
845200	847200	Yeah for some first-timers
848440	852040	That's super fair. Alright, so let's start by
852680	855440	Everyone, I want you to google real quick
855640	860200	I know this is an audio podcast and you rely on me to tell you
860920	864600	What you are seeing visually to think about in your head
864600	868520	But I used a certain picture for inspiration
869400	871240	Google red
871240	872760	sands
872760	879920	S-a-n-d-s red sands fort is a picture. I came across a while ago and it went in my
880800	885480	Photos on my phone and an album that I've labeled inspiration
885480	886400	Oh, okay
886400	890580	The hell is which also has of a weird fish that has human teeth
890740	894940	And it's all just shit I found on the internet and a picture of Dolly Parton
897340	901300	Inspiration it's sort of like the saying the thing that could became Sealand
901660	907420	It's very similar to the sea fort that became Sealand if you know what that is if you've ever watched a water world
907420	914060	It's very very much probably the aesthetic that they based their movie off of it's the exact rusty
915540	917540	aloft above an ocean
918500	920500	Yeah dilapidated basically
921340	925720	What I'm picturing as you guys are poking your heads out of this
926100	933660	Door of this hatch that kind of opens out down you see a ladder looking down on this boat about 10 yards below
934460	939460	This bay boat made out of this the same familiar inky black yet
939700	945760	Unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky you see the two men standing on this craft
945760	950160	One is a short stout man in his latter years a thick white beard
950960	956440	Makes his round face look even rounder and the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy
956600	962440	He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy
962800	967900	Overalls and the other man is John Lee Pettymore the fourth's uncle
968320	973220	Don D. Pettymore as you all poke your heads out of this hatch
973820	978460	We can see from the outside that you are in this kind of this
978700	986380	Lofted room that is made out of the similar inky black yet colorful substance that is on stilts
986860	992140	It is like a stilted room that the still legs then go down
992740	995580	into this shimmering silver sea
996140	997660	below you
997660	999660	Everyone roll sanity
1003820	1011500	Cuz you haven't rolled sanity since you arrived wherever you are now and I do think that that was a third whoopsie
1011540	1013540	so we're
1013940	1019420	Lost I don't know if that's a whoopsie cuz this just happened
1019740	1023580	Your brain finally caught up to the situation and you're all like fuck
1024940	1026940	What were we like?
1028140	1032420	Zach I didn't I didn't roll a score that passed
1033220	1038660	But it is the inverse of a passing score. It's 32 instead of 23. So does that get me anything?
1041780	1047900	That would be an interesting luck mechanic like spend five luck to reverse the numbers on your dice
1048820	1054360	But we don't use that currently so that is a fail. It's actually a very cool mechanic
1054360	1060100	I I doesn't that fun d4 plus one. I bet we would remember. Yeah, we would remember it and use it
1060100	1062100	And
1062740	1064940	Luke I heard you say that you failed, right?
1064940	1070660	I did so roll a d4 and add one and lose that much sanity three. I'm at 11
1070660	1074060	I a dangle crit failed. I'm still under my power
1074540	1080140	I'm not freaking out, but I critically know you are cuz you lose five sanity ouch
1080660	1082660	that puts me at 11 and
1083260	1089660	Clark Bishop with losing five sanity all in one go at the sight of all this. I'm gonna need a fight
1090980	1093140	Or freeze from yeah
1093820	1095820	Go ahead and rank those please
1096220	1098380	Honestly at this point freeze would be number one
1099180	1102780	Standing. Yeah. Sure. So four five six, you'll freeze and then probably
1103660	1110020	Flight, okay, so run away is number two and then yeah fight is my third and then fight is if you roll a one
1110020	1115340	I don't know what the fight is gonna be if I fight probably fuck somebody up dude. Yeah
1116740	1118740	Kill Leo piston again
1120820	1123020	Julie did it once you can do it twice
1125660	1127660	Go ahead and roll a d6 for me
1128980	1132720	It's a two, okay, that's gonna be run away run away
1133700	1138780	Clark Bishop has not yet made it down this ladder as you're all looking out this door and
1139000	1142340	He is looking for a place to run. He looks down at the ladder
1142340	1146760	He sees the boat down below with two men one of whom he vaguely
1147480	1151640	Remembers from his time growing up in contention as being a petty more and
1152320	1158600	The other he does not recognize at all. This is not running away going towards this boat. So he turns back
1158680	1164340	He opens up the other hatch in the room across the room from the hatch that is currently open
1164340	1166940	He slams the lever into the up position
1166940	1174400	He flings it open and he runs through it closing the door behind him. None of you were able wait, let me get a quick
1174920	1178340	Alertness or search from sorry Justin
1180920	1182100	Okay, good, thank you
1182100	1188920	I needed that Luke and Thomas give me a search or alertness and Thomas because you're looking at your uncle right now
1188920	1193260	I'm gonna put you at a negative 20. No pass. Oh, no, actually
1193260	1197480	I'm not gonna put you at a negative 20 because you really wanted to go through that door
1197480	1203460	Yeah, I think I'm pretty stoked on what just happened because I really wanted to see was like Uncle Don
1204380	1209460	It's cool to see you and all but weird things are happening all the time around here right now and
1210340	1216740	Frankly, you know, I learned I could distrust as many elder members of my family as I could trust
1217500	1220740	so who knows if you're just gonna try to rope me into some
1221380	1223380	shitty con or
1223420	1230260	You're gonna make me wait in the car for hours while you just get drunk in some bar a lot of bars. Yeah
1231260	1234540	And it's hot in this fucking car and so I want to see
1235140	1239120	What's through that other door? I really do no offense to Uncle Don
1239660	1244960	I've got a personal theory that we're just gonna see Uncle Don and this other guy in that boat again. I
1246740	1248820	Hope I didn't just give zacking out
1250900	1251820	Wait, hold up
1251820	1252980	But if that's true
1252980	1258760	Then in John Lee Pettymore's mind did Clark Bishop just fall to the same fate as spud
1258760	1260760	I haven't thought it all the way through
1261440	1265040	Or even a second step to be honest the way that you describe it
1265040	1268200	I pictured me wily coyoting my way out that door
1271200	1274160	So Clark Bishop is gone Joe take off your headphones
1274720	1281920	Keith Joe who the fuck is Joe John Keith John Justin looking down you see the two men
1281920	1287200	I would also see Keith right because he slid down the ladder at the end of the last episode
1287200	1292760	Oh, he did go down the ladder. Yes up above. I'm just like Keith
1293760	1295760	Don Don Keith
1296480	1299680	Don you'll do the plat thing and introduce Keith to that stranger
1299680	1302820	I'm gonna go poke my head through this other door real quick just to be sure
1303600	1306280	What's on the other side be careful? I will
1306960	1311800	What if it's scary kind of think we're in purgatory or whatever. So, you know, do we need to be careful?
1311800	1317100	I don't we'll probably just be in like, you know some kind of endless torture for the rest of you know
1318100	1322300	Eternity, so I might as well see what's through this other door
1322300	1324300	So I'm not wondering the whole time, you know
1324500	1327860	For the next thousand lifetimes or whatever the fuck until we get back to here
1327860	1333860	So I'm gonna poke my head through that door and I will be right back. Okay, be careful
1338460	1345660	As you're walking back through Leo piston is still just in his in his own eternal junkyard
1345900	1350180	Just squealing away in pain and you walk over to the other hatch
1350580	1356460	Yes, open it up and walk on through take off your headphones. I don't walk on. I just want to peek through
1356620	1360200	Okay, much like we did through this door or some of us did sure
1360820	1362820	Go ahead and take off your headphones
1366460	1369760	Who are you guys? Oh, right that man said that uh
1370500	1375100	Your name was Keith, huh? What the hell? What why do you sound like that?
1375180	1381220	Oh, my name is Jack Russell. Nice to meet you. He puts out his hand. I shake it
1381220	1386460	Have you seen the door what door and he turns back and he looks at dawn
1386820	1389420	He's of no use to us if he hadn't seen the door
1389620	1395420	It just kind of walks back and starts messing with some some I've seen the door inky black on the back
1395420	1401080	I saw the door Jack Russell turns around with his big Santa Claus eyebrows
1401280	1407600	Raised real high and he looks real big-eyed over at dawn boy says he's seen the door
1408040	1410760	Uh-huh. Can I tell if he's lying? Oh
1411720	1416220	Are you lying? Mmm. Yes, I am. He says he's lying. No
1423520	1425520	Yeah, go roll human, ooh
1426400	1429480	Is this my first time rolling a character in?
1430480	1433640	In the game, I don't think I ever had a character she did I
1434080	1439660	Did you not for Donovan was something or other? Oh, wait. No, I don't think I think we just kind of winged it. Oh
1440400	1445760	My god, we were so loosey-goosey. Yeah, this is Justin's first character sheet in the game
1446640	1452180	Crazy to me. Okay, so I'm rolling human. He's rolling persuade. Is that what you said? It's correct
1452320	1457180	Luke go ahead and roll persuade for Keith Vigna. I a crit succeeded I crit fail
1459920	1461320	88
1461320	1468920	What do you think? I'm gonna grab this man by the arm. Why are you lying boy? The door was a purple
1479560	1485240	I kind of tighten my grip. Don't lie to this man orange the orange. I
1486240	1488240	Saw it why are you here?
1489160	1495200	Yeah, the talk about the door what brought you here. I've came then through a door that one
1495840	1502240	Game a point up at the up there that one. How'd you is that how you got in here? What is this place?
1502760	1509600	Immediately Jack Russell pulls the boat up to the ladder and starts tying off both the rope and the ladder itself are made out of
1509600	1511480	this extremely colorful
1511480	1515440	Very black dark substance is tying off a euphemism
1518200	1522360	Jack are we gonna are we gonna go up here and search a little bit?
1522360	1526320	Well, if you're looking for you're looking for I'm looking for what I'm looking for
1527360	1529200	Let's explore sounds good
1529200	1534760	I let go of him and start climbing up the ladder as you guys are all at the bottom of this ladder
1534880	1537000	You can see that adjacent
1537400	1543960	So basically the the room above you that is about 10 yards up its square it has four walls, uh,
1544680	1551000	You are on one side of this square. So you would take the ladder up now on the adjacent wall
1551400	1556680	There seems to be a bridge and you're just now seeing it for the first time as you look up
1556680	1560760	There is sort of a rope bridge that is also
1561760	1563080	Unsurprisingly
1563080	1567200	made out of this flag we're colorful darkness and
1568040	1572040	It leads across to a second
1572560	1574960	Stilted room. So there's another
1575720	1581280	Identical stilted room that is attached with a rope bridge. That's cool
1582640	1585300	Yeah, nice Luke roll sanity
1586020	1588020	Oh
1589660	1591660	12 and I have 11
1592180	1600700	Okay, you just lose one. So now you have 10 as you realize the other hatch in the room above you is
1601860	1602940	across
1602940	1610580	from the hatch the two hatches are on opposite sides of the room and yet the rope bridge is
1610940	1616940	Coming from the adjacent wall not the wall that is parallel
1616940	1623500	It is the wall that is perpendicular that has the rope bridge attached to it. What are you looking at? So we had son
1628780	1631140	You got something wrong with you boy, I don't
1633460	1638000	Whoo, it's hard to look at that. I don't really know I can't even comprehend
1638000	1644080	I'll trust you on my boat by yourself and we're going up there. So you go up first. I'll go after you
1644080	1648960	I don't know who you want to go in the middle or you want to go first in the middle. Okay?
1649320	1652520	Jack Russell begins climbing. I start climbing after him
1654000	1656000	Nice view
1659120	1663140	All right, don I assume you're going up I'm so take the boat and dip
1663140	1667700	No, I'm continuing along
1673820	1675820	Birded me back in
1678020	1680020	Yeah, butter did me
1680020	1683540	Is it just me coming back or is Thomas need to be bad Thomas Thomas?
1684100	1685740	and
1685740	1690540	Justin and Luke bye. Bye. What kind of come are you?
1691380	1693220	Smoking
1693220	1697820	Get it. No. Yeah, I do not be there for you
1698620	1700620	When you come starts to fall
1701620	1703620	All right, you guys ready?
1703940	1704900	Yeah, yeah
1704900	1710660	A crazed Clark Bishop sprints through the door Wile E. Coyote style and you are suddenly in
1711140	1718780	Another one of these similar rooms except this one does not have nearly as much junk in it as the last and as you bust
1718900	1722980	In really the only things you see in here are a
1724140	1726140	hatch in front of you and
1726820	1732940	Two figures Oh, dr. Marie Jacobs is an older plump woman with mascara
1733460	1735840	smeared all over her entire face
1736300	1742460	Her hair is a disaster and she is wearing white coveralls and long
1743100	1746500	Neoprene gloves she is in the exact same
1747020	1752620	State that you saw her when she was locked up in the contention police department
1753020	1759640	except for the last time you saw her in the contention police department was on tape when you saw her body being lifted and then
1759640	1761640	slammed repeatedly into the ground
1761940	1767620	so you do notice the matted blood caked all over the back of her head and
1767940	1773580	She is laying on the ground next to the body of Doug Jacobs
1774060	1778260	With dried blood all filling his broken nose
1778260	1782120	He's still wearing that same pair of novelty boxer briefs
1782640	1790100	Featuring Pepe Le Pew and he has a black collar around his neck. He too has bruises all over him and
1791300	1792420	blood
1792420	1794140	coming out the back of
1794140	1798220	His head they are cuddling while laying on the ground
1798980	1803620	Looking straight up into the sky above you there is no
1804400	1809540	Ceiling in this room the only thing above you. Oh, wait. No, is that the ceiling?
1809540	1814380	You wouldn't even fucking know because it's the same inky black darkness
1814380	1817700	that is so colorful shining down on you and
1818440	1820200	Giving you peace while you sleep man
1820200	1826940	Maybe you know that the Lord loves you very very much and you bust in here and they really don't even fucking notice
1826940	1830000	Are they literally the only two things in here? Yes
1830620	1834540	How crazed is Clark does he just keep running past them doubt the next door?
1836220	1840860	Yes, I a hundred percent and as you run through the next door as
1841700	1846980	You run through the next door you slam it open and as you run through it
1846980	1854700	You actually bump into the back of John Lee Kevin Moore the third from behind somehow and the two of you fall
1854900	1859060	Kind of into the same room that has nothing in it except for
1859780	1861780	dr. Marie Jacobs and
1862340	1864340	Doug Jacobs
1864940	1867180	Clark I thought you were in front of me
1870780	1872460	Let's try that next hatch
1872460	1879340	What do I see when I look behind me first you see a junkyard of a room with and you can hear the cries of?
1879940	1885100	Yeah, go go go to that door that door that door and I'm kind of pushing you along to go out the next door and as
1885100	1888980	You go through it. You run through the same room again. Both of you are all sanity
1891980	1893980	Hey 17
1894980	1901660	Nice hey 10 I passed I do a 10 on an 11 lose 10 lose 10
1910340	1912340	I need one of you
1912380	1918980	Lose any as you realize nope this is exactly how this room works. Oh, okay, so it's just like a loop through that door
1918980	1920980	It's just a loop thing a loop
1921500	1925660	Loopy loop. Oh, it's like it's a lag. Yeah, damn it. So it's just the boat in this
1926300	1930260	Fucking dawn. I think I owe money or something. It's been a while
1931980	1936820	He's one of these one of those ones where it's like oh you're spending the day with Uncle Don and then it's like spending the
1936820	1941300	Day with Uncle Don was four hours in a hot car and then Uncle Don driving you home drunk. I
1943100	1947220	Mean yeah, he financed my racing career, but also, you know, fuck that dude
1948540	1953820	Isn't that the that the doctor isn't that the doctor and the the cat man body right there who?
1954260	1961000	Right there on the floor there. Yes. I see them those those people on the on the ground remind me. Dr
1961000	1964940	Marie Jacobs and that's Doug Jacobs her husband and he
1965780	1970540	He's actually Salem her cat remember the radio switch that the Doug Jacobs and the cat
1973180	1980460	You and she's like caressing his hair Doug Jacobs his head as it lays upon her breast and
1980940	1988660	They're just staring up into the endless ness above them and you as she kind of looks over and catches your eye
1989500	1990860	Oh
1990860	1992380	fuck
1992380	1997900	Now see Clark, that was a very succinct a very succinct summation as a war
1997900	2003420	I was just asking for the benefit of folks who might not have ever heard any kind of recap about this sort of story
2004420	2005660	you
2005660	2008940	absolute total fucking pieces of garbage
2010060	2016040	Sorry doctor police officers my ass. You're gonna lock us up when we're in love
2017040	2020840	And that's why we're here oh wait, okay, so
2021600	2023600	If we wouldn't have been locked up we wouldn't be here
2023720	2027000	Hey fair enough, but you weren't locked up because you were in love
2027000	2030480	But if you are admitting right now to being in love with your cat
2030840	2034480	Even though he's in the body of that man. That is a crime. I am so sorry
2034480	2042480	You cannot what part of it is a crime loving your animal. You said we're in love that that replies that implies romance
2042740	2045580	You see I love my friends. I love my partner
2046840	2051040	Clark here, but we're not in love. I love you too, John
2052800	2054800	Yeah, thanks, man
2056520	2058520	Thank you, I
2058720	2063840	Think I think we actually we yeah, we we kind of went over this but when we first
2064120	2068160	There I we don't know that there's a crime here, but it doesn't feel like it's
2069840	2075440	Doesn't feel like it's not a crime. Yeah, I am getting a real sense of deja vu with this conversation
2075480	2079780	But ma'am once again like while I understand the appeal of having a cat
2079780	2084680	Will you just leave us in a person-sized body and just like rolling around on the floor with that?
2085200	2090200	When you start to say like I'm in we're in love that implies a level of
2090720	2094840	NFC being reached with that body that I don't think is appropriate
2095360	2099400	Either for the original owner of that body the cat's mind. That's now in it
2099400	2101400	Or
2101400	2107780	God frankly or God. Yeah, that's not what Asian on this relationship without knowing anything about us
2108680	2114800	Hmm. Well, then maybe just be more careful with your words, you know, no, it's like a cat mine in a human body
2114800	2120480	That's that. Yeah, I don't know the the context and we see you rolling around on the floor there. I'm not trying
2121000	2123640	Yeah, I guess I am trying to yuck your yum
2124480	2126480	This this is yucky
2127480	2134680	And she kisses Doug Jacobs on the head and goes and looks directly in your eyes and says yummy
2137640	2145460	You know, there was nothing inherently gross about you kissing your cat man on the head until you said yummy again
2145460	2148520	It's just the way you're approaching all of this. That is very
2149080	2154400	It just seems like it's coming from the wrong angle. It's not making me comfortable at all good
2155240	2159280	Go away what doctor help? How long have you been here?
2160400	2167880	She looks up into the stars above that don't exist. I've been here forever. I
2168760	2170760	Was born here. I
2171160	2175640	Will die here and when I die, I will remain here
2176720	2180880	Well, I don't I don't think that's the case because we had you in a jail cell. We just talked about that
2180880	2184640	So you weren't yeah, you're literally talking about yeah your memories with us
2185640	2188840	Outside of here, so you won't remain here. Oh
2192040	2197280	Sorry you cut out on the discord call of little faith, oh you just didn't finish your sentence
2198000	2201100	In a normal time you Michael borrowed it
2202520	2205280	Really just sounded like you got cut right off. So
2206440	2208520	Is it clear that my?
2210880	2212880	Intention
2214200	2216200	Is to annoy you
2218120	2224320	Yeah, you know ma'am personally, you know, I don't she begins licking the hair of Doug Jacobs, oh
2225480	2231380	Yeah, again, that doesn't bug me cuz that just seems like if she's being a cat like I don't know
2231400	2236960	We're all cats down here. What bugs me is when she implies that she fucks the cat. I'm with you
2236960	2238200	I'm with you on that and she's like
2238200	2244600	Why do you think I'm applying that and then she implies it more and I don't care about rolling around with your big cat, man
2244800	2248000	That sounds enjoyable and adorable. I
2248800	2251880	Just don't don't fuck the cat man. Don't I
2253960	2258360	Just cross a line from time to time every now and then she does imply that there's a line being crossed
2258600	2261400	Yeah, it seems like a cat man's getting fucked
2265200	2268400	Scratch his ears, you know lick his hair. All right, whatever
2269080	2274080	Rub his whiskers, but he does both don't please don't fucking have whiskers anymore
2274320	2277580	Please I was being I was being you know imaginative
2277580	2285060	I was being playful like the spirit being very imaginative when you keep talking about me fucking this cat when
2285060	2288660	It seems like that's all you want to think about to be fair
2290660	2295620	Yeah, exactly I knew it I'm not gonna engage with you because you know exactly what you're doing
2295620	2298540	So I'm not just gonna get in little word games with you where you're like
2298540	2303180	Oh, you're the one who wants to fuck cat cuz you're the one fucking this cat apparently
2305620	2308680	It's good to know that setting doesn't change the show at all
2308680	2310680	On
2314640	2316640	That note I think I'm gonna switch back over
2321720	2323720	She's getting to a point where we could
2327960	2331000	Yep, this is about the right time to switch
2332120	2334680	But could we real quick just ask her some questions?
2335120	2338760	Like I literally just want to be like if she can engage with me on a real level
2338760	2342760	I want to just be like, what are your impressions having been here? Okay fucking do it
2343400	2348760	Maybe you fuck that cat. Maybe you don't let us put that aside for a moment
2349240	2353000	Petty more. I didn't know you were from here. Now. What do you mean by that?
2353520	2357120	Bishop look at his face. I look at his face Clark
2357120	2364120	You can clearly see just the the booze that's pouring out of his eyes and his ears and his nose and his mouth
2364360	2371880	Is the same inky dark substance that is extremely colorful at the same time. It's like dripping down from my eyes
2371880	2376140	Oh, yeah, do I look really fucking goth and badass? You look so
2377320	2379960	Cool, you're also in like Kevin's body
2379960	2387040	Which is like scarred up and you're in all black tactical gear like and I think canonically he was described
2388840	2390840	As Sam Elliott in Roadhouse
2391840	2393840	Oh my god he was
2393840	2396480	So Sam Elliott in Roadhouse but in like
2397200	2398640	an
2398640	2400640	amazing and possibly like
