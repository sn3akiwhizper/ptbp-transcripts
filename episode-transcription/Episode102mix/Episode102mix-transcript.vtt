Dimension where biscuits are the only currency in jam shit, baby. You don't even want to hear about jam

00:17.400 --> 00:19.600
I'm also live from

00:20.720 --> 00:27.360
694.2 I guess whatever this episode's howlin with wolf is for more e in Seattle

01:01.760 --> 01:03.260
Maury

01:03.260 --> 01:09.080
It's crazy that you promised to kill your friends on a public radio show like this one now

01:09.080 --> 01:14.220
I promise not to kill my producer and that's a threat or a promise

01:14.220 --> 01:17.600
Which one is the one where I'll probably kill them for sure

01:17.760 --> 01:21.300

The clicks make people take this wolf and pony show more seriously

01:48.440 --> 01:52.720
Go ahead click right now and peruse while I read the news

01:53.480 --> 01:59.680
Last time not much happened the three leads of this absurd production fell

01:59.960 --> 02:06.820
Upwards into an impossibly dark and equally vibrant nothingness all while witnessing

02:07.640 --> 02:12.920
unnatural visions of scenes that were are or will be played out

02:13.600 --> 02:18.160
Involving themselves in either this or a different timeline

02:18.400 --> 02:23.040
They landed in a world made of this same wild texture

02:23.240 --> 02:27.760
But the ground was made of pure light as that setting faded

02:27.760 --> 02:34.080
They found themselves in a junk filled room with Leo piston before the uber driver spud

02:34.800 --> 02:42.280
exited without watching his footing and fell out of this elevated room to his abrupt demise of swift

02:42.880 --> 02:49.640
smothering of the shimmering silver sea a boat approached that held two figures one a

02:49.960 --> 02:57.760
Ferryman in overalls a beanie in a big white beard and the other was John's uncle Don D. Pettymore

02:58.960 --> 03:05.120
I've been wolf. That was the news. I could use something heavy and dripping in sin

03:05.240 --> 03:09.640
It's dragon in three with what kind of world are you living in?

03:12.280 --> 03:20.280
Bad girls on top of the water

03:20.280 --> 03:24.280
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

03:24.280 --> 03:28.280
Leaving my mind at your altar

03:28.280 --> 03:32.280
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

03:32.280 --> 03:38.280
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

03:39.280 --> 03:47.280
What kind of world are you living in?

03:50.280 --> 03:56.880
So we had the same dare officer all through like middle school and then into junior high and then into high school

03:56.880 --> 04:01.720
He was like our police officer that worked at our school and then in high school freshman year

04:01.720 --> 04:04.040
He came to our health class to teach sex ed

04:04.200 --> 04:10.400
It was a in the time where you had those cell phones that were like flip phones and you could set them to a

04:11.040 --> 04:14.320
setting that was vibrate then ring and

04:14.960 --> 04:19.760
So his phone starts vibrating in class as he's teaching and he looks down and he goes

04:19.760 --> 04:24.400
Oh, it's just my wife and he clicks the button or he tries to and so he thinks he's turned it off

04:24.920 --> 04:30.740
But then the ringtone starts and it was like wow. You're a crazy bitch watch your fuck so good

04:34.320 --> 04:36.320
And buck cherry played and

04:37.400 --> 04:42.680
Nice, not sure I ever recovered buck cherry played here in Springfield and the guitarist

04:43.200 --> 04:45.800
shopped at our local music place Hoover and

04:46.240 --> 04:50.600
bought the exact guitar that my guitarist was saving up for

04:52.080 --> 04:55.120
He was in the store at the same time and watched him walk out with it

04:57.960 --> 04:59.960
Really sucked

05:00.240 --> 05:08.040
When you say you've never recovered from that like you mean that was the moment that set what you wanted to be in life or

05:09.240 --> 05:14.660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was just like man. There's not there's not much that's better than that, huh?

05:17.760 --> 05:19.480
Yeah, I

05:19.480 --> 05:25.000
Don't know how we how we get back. Oh, I guess we just start the I guess we just start yeah

05:25.000 --> 05:27.760
For once we could just have an episode start with us playing

05:30.840 --> 05:32.840
Oh

05:32.880 --> 05:37.840
No, we kind of do the Dragon Ball Z thing where like you think it's gonna fill up the whole time slot

05:37.840 --> 05:41.480
but then it's like short and half of it is recap and then fucking around I

05:44.400 --> 05:47.680
Thought you meant that we were just dragging our balls same thing

05:49.400 --> 05:53.180
Well instead of dragging our balls, let's get some oopsies out of the way

05:53.180 --> 05:57.640
I've got some whoopsies to whoopsies to be exact to start out with

05:58.280 --> 06:02.240
First whoopsie what you guys woke up in the mausoleum and

06:03.080 --> 06:05.080
You've been through some shit

06:05.480 --> 06:12.400
Especially this time. You've definitely been around lots of unnatural learn lots about the unnatural and

06:13.240 --> 06:14.920
Every time that's happened so far

06:14.920 --> 06:21.240
We've changed the entire nature of the role-playing game that we're playing by having you guys roll to d20 for a natural

06:21.580 --> 06:25.240
And adding that to your skill point so I need

06:25.920 --> 06:31.040
Joe Thomas Luke to roll to d20 for a natural and

06:32.600 --> 06:37.920
Justin hi, I assume that on your character sheet your unnatural score is at a zero no

06:37.920 --> 06:43.080
It's it's quite high actually. Oh good. That is what did we talk about that? Mm-hmm

06:43.920 --> 06:49.360
Okay, good a rest of you might get some real high numbers here. So let's hear those 2d 20 rolls

06:50.080 --> 06:55.480
29 total for me 29 total. Okay. So what does that put your total at? That's a good question

06:56.680 --> 07:03.360
That's why I asked it. I love asking good questions. Okay, I have 79 now Jesus

07:04.080 --> 07:06.080
fucking Christ

07:06.360 --> 07:09.640
Yeah, I'd smoke that guy's cum cool

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
And Joe

07:16.200 --> 07:18.200
I

07:18.240 --> 07:25.800
Rolled back-to-back sevens, so that's that's a 14 added to my head 49. I think so. I'm at 63

07:25.800 --> 07:31.600
No, that's really really high for an unnatural score and Thomas speaking of 14

07:31.600 --> 07:37.720
I rolled a 14 and a 9 which is 23 added to my previous score that gives me 67

07:38.120 --> 07:40.120
Nice, we're all good at unnatural

07:41.080 --> 07:43.320
Zach's like, why did I give them 2d 20?

07:43.320 --> 07:48.900
Nah, you know this is we're in the um, I know that you guys aren't fans of quality film

07:49.120 --> 07:52.380
But I believe they call this the end game. I

07:54.320 --> 07:59.000
Hate myself and so you guys are going to have a lot of

08:00.040 --> 08:07.880
Natural skill points Luke is a member of the moxie our local independent theater, which means that according to his contract

08:07.880 --> 08:10.140
He's not allowed to watch Marvel movies

08:11.440 --> 08:13.440
Hill's films have

08:14.080 --> 08:16.080
climaxes and dinner moves

08:17.200 --> 08:22.860
Badass shit like end games Luke likes to go to the cinema. We like to go to the right. Yeah

08:24.940 --> 08:30.860
Cinema yeah, okay. I enjoy kenel. I only watch movies where the women have armpit hair

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
It's kind of my dating policy

08:37.960 --> 08:40.160
Oh, you guys have a lot of unnatural

08:40.520 --> 08:46.760
Yeah, we do at this point and you can use those whenever you want to do things that are unnatural

08:47.680 --> 08:55.240
Wasn't there a big downside to it if we if we oh, yeah. Yep, if you fail, it'll it'll be real bad

08:58.400 --> 08:59.680
No

08:59.680 --> 09:02.060
When you when you are dealing in the unnatural

09:02.840 --> 09:04.520
Things don't always

09:04.520 --> 09:10.120
Go the way you planned and when they go awry the true horror being involved with this

09:10.380 --> 09:14.520
This nature of items or beliefs or thoughts or words

09:15.080 --> 09:20.080
Can really come back and bite you in the little butt come in the butt

09:21.260 --> 09:23.260
cool

09:24.200 --> 09:31.260
So if you were wanting to do something that you didn't think was humanly possible we could roll that skill to see if it happens

09:31.380 --> 09:33.380
I want to eat a million sandwiches

09:36.620 --> 09:42.080
Natural doesn't seem humanly possible. I want to see sandwiches. Yeah

09:45.020 --> 09:47.020
Okay, so with all that

09:48.420 --> 09:53.380
Unnatural business out of the way. I need Justin Luke and Thomas to remove their headphones

09:54.820 --> 09:59.340
Hi, I thought this might be the other oopsie

09:59.980 --> 10:06.720
You almost got away with it almost snuck one right past yo dungeon master

10:08.420 --> 10:10.920
It's time for you to roll for a mania

10:12.700 --> 10:16.820
Cuz I hit my breaking point you remember what it was it made me hit it was

10:17.220 --> 10:24.780
when you saw a giant wave of black ooze that was about to pour down over the

10:25.780 --> 10:28.860
Vw bug or not bug the van that you were in

10:29.780 --> 10:31.900
23 92 89 Oh

10:32.740 --> 10:34.260
23 Michael Jordan

10:34.260 --> 10:39.680
Cardo koi card cart card a coif these hmm an uncontrollable

10:40.200 --> 10:47.180
Compulsion to see maps everywhere to see what the fuck does that mean a compulsion to see maps?

10:48.340 --> 10:50.800
So like you think everything is a map

10:51.800 --> 10:56.240
That means we have to go this way maybe I could be kind of fun that could be fun

10:56.240 --> 11:01.240
I just read it. I just read a Dan Brown book, so I'm kind of hip to seeing maps and shit

11:03.160 --> 11:04.960
Angels and demons

11:04.960 --> 11:08.040
Actually, it was the lost symbol is the one I read. Oh, I don't know

11:08.040 --> 11:14.560
Those are the only two things that I know about Dan Brown is that he wrote those two books and he's played by Tom Hanks

11:14.560 --> 11:16.280
in real life

11:16.720 --> 11:20.800
Rolled up 23. What else did you roll a 92 92 the year I was born

11:22.000 --> 11:24.560
technomania an obsession with new technology

11:26.880 --> 11:34.280
Okay, and finally 89 89 in the year someone else was born me yeah, that's what I thought oh

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
Scribble o mania

11:40.080 --> 11:45.120
obsession with scribbling or doodling so maps everywhere

11:45.920 --> 11:49.420
Obsession with new technology or obsession with scribbling

11:50.200 --> 11:54.720
Doodling do I have anything on my person that I could scribble with at this point. Oh, you know

11:56.000 --> 11:58.620
Yeah, I think I've whipped out a notepad a few times. Oh, yeah

11:59.400 --> 12:03.280
Notepad pain I'm between maps and notepad. What do you what do you think?

12:03.280 --> 12:07.640
Do you do you have a narrative one that would help you? I think both would be excellent

12:07.640 --> 12:09.640
I will say two things one

12:09.920 --> 12:14.840
We have had a virus of sorts in this show before where?

12:15.720 --> 12:17.400
scribbling was

12:17.400 --> 12:24.120
Happened by the people who had it and I think that would be narratively interesting because if you start scribbling stuff constantly

12:24.120 --> 12:29.000
I think the other PCs will think there's something wrong with you, which could be interesting and

12:29.600 --> 12:37.120
Then I think the map could be narratively interesting as well because you are currently looking for a way out of this place

12:37.400 --> 12:43.720
So that would lead you very easily to play out that one. Fuck. They're both good

12:43.960 --> 12:47.040
Well, I can see how I could play both of them. I'm gonna go

12:48.240 --> 12:50.240
I'm gonna go I

12:50.500 --> 12:55.880
Think I'm gonna go fuck shit. I'm gonna go see maps. I'm gonna go see maps. Okay. Yeah that see maps

12:56.400 --> 12:58.840
on this on the shimmering silver see

13:00.800 --> 13:03.800
All right, let's get the boys back in here with Matt man

13:04.520 --> 13:06.520
My man

13:08.240 --> 13:15.160
Birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie eagle albatross par birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie birdie

13:15.160 --> 13:18.280
bogey double bogey triple bogey, they really ran out of

13:19.400 --> 13:24.880
Ideas for bad golfing pretty quickly. They came up with such cool names for good golfing

13:24.880 --> 13:31.480
And then I've just remembered who I'm talking to but Zach. This is a great point. We know the golfing things

13:31.480 --> 13:39.160
We know those days. Yeah eagle. We just don't know what happens when you go to a golf course and like talk to the lady

13:40.240 --> 13:47.080
Yeah, for those of you who are not a citizen of contention over on patreon.com slash. Oh, yeah

13:47.080 --> 13:49.080
This didn't happen on the mainstream

13:49.320 --> 13:49.840
No

13:49.840 --> 13:53.280
It's not we recently had it at a game where these boys had to

13:53.440 --> 13:58.040
Had to meet for a delta green mission on a golf course and they didn't know what the fuck to do

13:58.040 --> 14:04.760
I I feel like I feel like in real life people would have been a lot more helpful than Zach was

14:05.200 --> 14:07.200
Yeah for some first-timers

14:08.440 --> 14:12.040
That's super fair. Alright, so let's start by

14:12.680 --> 14:15.440
Everyone, I want you to google real quick

14:15.640 --> 14:20.200
I know this is an audio podcast and you rely on me to tell you

14:20.920 --> 14:24.600
What you are seeing visually to think about in your head

14:24.600 --> 14:28.520
But I used a certain picture for inspiration

14:29.400 --> 14:31.240
Google red

14:31.240 --> 14:32.760
sands

14:32.760 --> 14:39.920
S-a-n-d-s red sands fort is a picture. I came across a while ago and it went in my

14:40.800 --> 14:45.480
Photos on my phone and an album that I've labeled inspiration

14:45.480 --> 14:46.400
Oh, okay

14:46.400 --> 14:50.580
The hell is which also has of a weird fish that has human teeth

14:50.740 --> 14:54.940
And it's all just shit I found on the internet and a picture of Dolly Parton

14:57.340 --> 15:01.300
Inspiration it's sort of like the saying the thing that could became Sealand

15:01.660 --> 15:07.420
It's very similar to the sea fort that became Sealand if you know what that is if you've ever watched a water world

15:07.420 --> 15:14.060
It's very very much probably the aesthetic that they based their movie off of it's the exact rusty

15:15.540 --> 15:17.540
aloft above an ocean

15:18.500 --> 15:20.500
Yeah dilapidated basically

15:21.340 --> 15:25.720
What I'm picturing as you guys are poking your heads out of this

15:26.100 --> 15:33.660
Door of this hatch that kind of opens out down you see a ladder looking down on this boat about 10 yards below

15:34.460 --> 15:39.460
This bay boat made out of this the same familiar inky black yet

15:39.700 --> 15:45.760
Unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky you see the two men standing on this craft

15:45.760 --> 15:50.160
One is a short stout man in his latter years a thick white beard

15:50.960 --> 15:56.440
Makes his round face look even rounder and the bags under his eyes are large and fluffy

15:56.600 --> 16:02.440
He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy

16:02.800 --> 16:07.900
Overalls and the other man is John Lee Pettymore the fourth's uncle

16:08.320 --> 16:13.220
Don D. Pettymore as you all poke your heads out of this hatch

16:13.820 --> 16:18.460
We can see from the outside that you are in this kind of this

16:18.700 --> 16:26.380
Lofted room that is made out of the similar inky black yet colorful substance that is on stilts

16:26.860 --> 16:32.140
It is like a stilted room that the still legs then go down

16:32.740 --> 16:35.580
into this shimmering silver sea

16:36.140 --> 16:37.660
below you

16:37.660 --> 16:39.660
Everyone roll sanity

16:43.820 --> 16:51.500
Cuz you haven't rolled sanity since you arrived wherever you are now and I do think that that was a third whoopsie

16:51.540 --> 16:53.540
so we're

16:53.940 --> 16:59.420
Lost I don't know if that's a whoopsie cuz this just happened

16:59.740 --> 17:03.580
Your brain finally caught up to the situation and you're all like fuck

17:04.940 --> 17:06.940
What were we like?

17:08.140 --> 17:12.420
Zach I didn't I didn't roll a score that passed

17:13.220 --> 17:18.660
But it is the inverse of a passing score. It's 32 instead of 23. So does that get me anything?

17:21.780 --> 17:27.900
That would be an interesting luck mechanic like spend five luck to reverse the numbers on your dice

17:28.820 --> 17:34.360
But we don't use that currently so that is a fail. It's actually a very cool mechanic

17:34.360 --> 17:40.100
I I doesn't that fun d4 plus one. I bet we would remember. Yeah, we would remember it and use it

17:40.100 --> 17:42.100
And

17:42.740 --> 17:44.940
Luke I heard you say that you failed, right?

17:44.940 --> 17:50.660
I did so roll a d4 and add one and lose that much sanity three. I'm at 11

17:50.660 --> 17:54.060
I a dangle crit failed. I'm still under my power

17:54.540 --> 18:00.140
I'm not freaking out, but I critically know you are cuz you lose five sanity ouch

18:00.660 --> 18:02.660
that puts me at 11 and

18:03.260 --> 18:09.660
Clark Bishop with losing five sanity all in one go at the sight of all this. I'm gonna need a fight

18:10.980 --> 18:13.140
Or freeze from yeah

18:13.820 --> 18:15.820
Go ahead and rank those please

18:16.220 --> 18:18.380
Honestly at this point freeze would be number one

18:19.180 --> 18:22.780
Standing. Yeah. Sure. So four five six, you'll freeze and then probably

18:23.660 --> 18:30.020
Flight, okay, so run away is number two and then yeah fight is my third and then fight is if you roll a one

18:30.020 --> 18:35.340
I don't know what the fight is gonna be if I fight probably fuck somebody up dude. Yeah

18:36.740 --> 18:38.740
Kill Leo piston again

18:40.820 --> 18:43.020
Julie did it once you can do it twice

18:45.660 --> 18:47.660
Go ahead and roll a d6 for me

18:48.980 --> 18:52.720
It's a two, okay, that's gonna be run away run away

18:53.700 --> 18:58.780
Clark Bishop has not yet made it down this ladder as you're all looking out this door and

18:59.000 --> 19:02.340
He is looking for a place to run. He looks down at the ladder

19:02.340 --> 19:06.760
He sees the boat down below with two men one of whom he vaguely

19:07.480 --> 19:11.640
Remembers from his time growing up in contention as being a petty more and

19:12.320 --> 19:18.600
The other he does not recognize at all. This is not running away going towards this boat. So he turns back

19:18.680 --> 19:24.340
He opens up the other hatch in the room across the room from the hatch that is currently open

19:24.340 --> 19:26.940
He slams the lever into the up position

19:26.940 --> 19:34.400
He flings it open and he runs through it closing the door behind him. None of you were able wait, let me get a quick

19:34.920 --> 19:38.340
Alertness or search from sorry Justin

19:40.920 --> 19:42.100
Okay, good, thank you

19:42.100 --> 19:48.920
I needed that Luke and Thomas give me a search or alertness and Thomas because you're looking at your uncle right now

19:48.920 --> 19:53.260
I'm gonna put you at a negative 20. No pass. Oh, no, actually

19:53.260 --> 19:57.480
I'm not gonna put you at a negative 20 because you really wanted to go through that door

19:57.480 --> 20:03.460
Yeah, I think I'm pretty stoked on what just happened because I really wanted to see was like Uncle Don

20:04.380 --> 20:09.460
It's cool to see you and all but weird things are happening all the time around here right now and

20:10.340 --> 20:16.740
Frankly, you know, I learned I could distrust as many elder members of my family as I could trust

20:17.500 --> 20:20.740
so who knows if you're just gonna try to rope me into some

20:21.380 --> 20:23.380
shitty con or

20:23.420 --> 20:30.260
You're gonna make me wait in the car for hours while you just get drunk in some bar a lot of bars. Yeah

20:31.260 --> 20:34.540
And it's hot in this fucking car and so I want to see

20:35.140 --> 20:39.120
What's through that other door? I really do no offense to Uncle Don

20:39.660 --> 20:44.960
I've got a personal theory that we're just gonna see Uncle Don and this other guy in that boat again. I

20:46.740 --> 20:48.820
Hope I didn't just give zacking out

20:50.900 --> 20:51.820
Wait, hold up

20:51.820 --> 20:52.980
But if that's true

20:52.980 --> 20:58.760
Then in John Lee Pettymore's mind did Clark Bishop just fall to the same fate as spud

20:58.760 --> 21:00.760
I haven't thought it all the way through

21:01.440 --> 21:05.040
Or even a second step to be honest the way that you describe it

21:05.040 --> 21:08.200
I pictured me wily coyoting my way out that door

21:11.200 --> 21:14.160
So Clark Bishop is gone Joe take off your headphones

21:14.720 --> 21:21.920
Keith Joe who the fuck is Joe John Keith John Justin looking down you see the two men

21:21.920 --> 21:27.200
I would also see Keith right because he slid down the ladder at the end of the last episode

21:27.200 --> 21:32.760
Oh, he did go down the ladder. Yes up above. I'm just like Keith

21:33.760 --> 21:35.760
Don Don Keith

21:36.480 --> 21:39.680
Don you'll do the plat thing and introduce Keith to that stranger

21:39.680 --> 21:42.820
I'm gonna go poke my head through this other door real quick just to be sure

21:43.600 --> 21:46.280
What's on the other side be careful? I will

21:46.960 --> 21:51.800
What if it's scary kind of think we're in purgatory or whatever. So, you know, do we need to be careful?

21:51.800 --> 21:57.100
I don't we'll probably just be in like, you know some kind of endless torture for the rest of you know

21:58.100 --> 22:02.300
Eternity, so I might as well see what's through this other door

22:02.300 --> 22:04.300
So I'm not wondering the whole time, you know

22:04.500 --> 22:07.860
For the next thousand lifetimes or whatever the fuck until we get back to here

22:07.860 --> 22:13.860
So I'm gonna poke my head through that door and I will be right back. Okay, be careful

22:18.460 --> 22:25.660
As you're walking back through Leo piston is still just in his in his own eternal junkyard

22:25.900 --> 22:30.180
Just squealing away in pain and you walk over to the other hatch

22:30.580 --> 22:36.460
Yes, open it up and walk on through take off your headphones. I don't walk on. I just want to peek through

22:36.620 --> 22:40.200
Okay, much like we did through this door or some of us did sure

22:40.820 --> 22:42.820
Go ahead and take off your headphones

22:46.460 --> 22:49.760
Who are you guys? Oh, right that man said that uh

22:50.500 --> 22:55.100
Your name was Keith, huh? What the hell? What why do you sound like that?

22:55.180 --> 23:01.220
Oh, my name is Jack Russell. Nice to meet you. He puts out his hand. I shake it

23:01.220 --> 23:06.460
Have you seen the door what door and he turns back and he looks at dawn

23:06.820 --> 23:09.420
He's of no use to us if he hadn't seen the door

23:09.620 --> 23:15.420
It just kind of walks back and starts messing with some some I've seen the door inky black on the back

23:15.420 --> 23:21.080
I saw the door Jack Russell turns around with his big Santa Claus eyebrows

23:21.280 --> 23:27.600
Raised real high and he looks real big-eyed over at dawn boy says he's seen the door

23:28.040 --> 23:30.760
Uh-huh. Can I tell if he's lying? Oh

23:31.720 --> 23:36.220
Are you lying? Mmm. Yes, I am. He says he's lying. No

23:43.520 --> 23:45.520
Yeah, go roll human, ooh

23:46.400 --> 23:49.480
Is this my first time rolling a character in?

23:50.480 --> 23:53.640
In the game, I don't think I ever had a character she did I

23:54.080 --> 23:59.660
Did you not for Donovan was something or other? Oh, wait. No, I don't think I think we just kind of winged it. Oh

24:00.400 --> 24:05.760
My god, we were so loosey-goosey. Yeah, this is Justin's first character sheet in the game

24:06.640 --> 24:12.180
Crazy to me. Okay, so I'm rolling human. He's rolling persuade. Is that what you said? It's correct

24:12.320 --> 24:17.180
Luke go ahead and roll persuade for Keith Vigna. I a crit succeeded I crit fail

24:19.920 --> 24:21.320
88

24:21.320 --> 24:28.920
What do you think? I'm gonna grab this man by the arm. Why are you lying boy? The door was a purple

24:39.560 --> 24:45.240
I kind of tighten my grip. Don't lie to this man orange the orange. I

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
Saw it why are you here?

24:49.160 --> 24:55.200
Yeah, the talk about the door what brought you here. I've came then through a door that one

24:55.840 --> 25:02.240
Game a point up at the up there that one. How'd you is that how you got in here? What is this place?

25:02.760 --> 25:09.600
Immediately Jack Russell pulls the boat up to the ladder and starts tying off both the rope and the ladder itself are made out of

25:09.600 --> 25:11.480
this extremely colorful

25:11.480 --> 25:15.440
Very black dark substance is tying off a euphemism

25:18.200 --> 25:22.360
Jack are we gonna are we gonna go up here and search a little bit?

25:22.360 --> 25:26.320
Well, if you're looking for you're looking for I'm looking for what I'm looking for

25:27.360 --> 25:29.200
Let's explore sounds good

25:29.200 --> 25:34.760
I let go of him and start climbing up the ladder as you guys are all at the bottom of this ladder

25:34.880 --> 25:37.000
You can see that adjacent

25:37.400 --> 25:43.960
So basically the the room above you that is about 10 yards up its square it has four walls, uh,

25:44.680 --> 25:51.000
You are on one side of this square. So you would take the ladder up now on the adjacent wall

25:51.400 --> 25:56.680
There seems to be a bridge and you're just now seeing it for the first time as you look up

25:56.680 --> 26:00.760
There is sort of a rope bridge that is also

26:01.760 --> 26:03.080
Unsurprisingly

26:03.080 --> 26:07.200
made out of this flag we're colorful darkness and

26:08.040 --> 26:12.040
It leads across to a second

26:12.560 --> 26:14.960
Stilted room. So there's another

26:15.720 --> 26:21.280
Identical stilted room that is attached with a rope bridge. That's cool

26:22.640 --> 26:25.300
Yeah, nice Luke roll sanity

26:26.020 --> 26:28.020
Oh

26:29.660 --> 26:31.660
12 and I have 11

26:32.180 --> 26:40.700
Okay, you just lose one. So now you have 10 as you realize the other hatch in the room above you is

26:41.860 --> 26:42.940
across

26:42.940 --> 26:50.580
from the hatch the two hatches are on opposite sides of the room and yet the rope bridge is

26:50.940 --> 26:56.940
Coming from the adjacent wall not the wall that is parallel

26:56.940 --> 27:03.500
It is the wall that is perpendicular that has the rope bridge attached to it. What are you looking at? So we had son

27:08.780 --> 27:11.140
You got something wrong with you boy, I don't

27:13.460 --> 27:18.000
Whoo, it's hard to look at that. I don't really know I can't even comprehend

27:18.000 --> 27:24.080
I'll trust you on my boat by yourself and we're going up there. So you go up first. I'll go after you

27:24.080 --> 27:28.960
I don't know who you want to go in the middle or you want to go first in the middle. Okay?

27:29.320 --> 27:32.520
Jack Russell begins climbing. I start climbing after him

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Nice view

27:39.120 --> 27:43.140
All right, don I assume you're going up I'm so take the boat and dip

27:43.140 --> 27:47.700
No, I'm continuing along

27:53.820 --> 27:55.820
Birded me back in

27:58.020 --> 28:00.020
Yeah, butter did me

28:00.020 --> 28:03.540
Is it just me coming back or is Thomas need to be bad Thomas Thomas?

28:04.100 --> 28:05.740
and

28:05.740 --> 28:10.540
Justin and Luke bye. Bye. What kind of come are you?

28:11.380 --> 28:13.220
Smoking

28:13.220 --> 28:17.820
Get it. No. Yeah, I do not be there for you

28:18.620 --> 28:20.620
When you come starts to fall

28:21.620 --> 28:23.620
All right, you guys ready?

28:23.940 --> 28:24.900
Yeah, yeah

28:24.900 --> 28:30.660
A crazed Clark Bishop sprints through the door Wile E. Coyote style and you are suddenly in

28:31.140 --> 28:38.780
Another one of these similar rooms except this one does not have nearly as much junk in it as the last and as you bust

28:38.900 --> 28:42.980
In really the only things you see in here are a

28:44.140 --> 28:46.140
hatch in front of you and

28:46.820 --> 28:52.940
Two figures Oh, dr. Marie Jacobs is an older plump woman with mascara

28:53.460 --> 28:55.840
smeared all over her entire face

28:56.300 --> 29:02.460
Her hair is a disaster and she is wearing white coveralls and long

29:03.100 --> 29:06.500
Neoprene gloves she is in the exact same

29:07.020 --> 29:12.620
State that you saw her when she was locked up in the contention police department

29:13.020 --> 29:19.640
except for the last time you saw her in the contention police department was on tape when you saw her body being lifted and then

29:19.640 --> 29:21.640
slammed repeatedly into the ground

29:21.940 --> 29:27.620
so you do notice the matted blood caked all over the back of her head and

29:27.940 --> 29:33.580
She is laying on the ground next to the body of Doug Jacobs

29:34.060 --> 29:38.260
With dried blood all filling his broken nose

29:38.260 --> 29:42.120
He's still wearing that same pair of novelty boxer briefs

29:42.640 --> 29:50.100
Featuring Pepe Le Pew and he has a black collar around his neck. He too has bruises all over him and

29:51.300 --> 29:52.420
blood

29:52.420 --> 29:54.140
coming out the back of

29:54.140 --> 29:58.220
His head they are cuddling while laying on the ground

29:58.980 --> 30:03.620
Looking straight up into the sky above you there is no

30:04.400 --> 30:09.540
Ceiling in this room the only thing above you. Oh, wait. No, is that the ceiling?

30:09.540 --> 30:14.380
You wouldn't even fucking know because it's the same inky black darkness

30:14.380 --> 30:17.700
that is so colorful shining down on you and

30:18.440 --> 30:20.200
Giving you peace while you sleep man

30:20.200 --> 30:26.940
Maybe you know that the Lord loves you very very much and you bust in here and they really don't even fucking notice

30:26.940 --> 30:30.000
Are they literally the only two things in here? Yes

30:30.620 --> 30:34.540
How crazed is Clark does he just keep running past them doubt the next door?

30:36.220 --> 30:40.860
Yes, I a hundred percent and as you run through the next door as

30:41.700 --> 30:46.980
You run through the next door you slam it open and as you run through it

30:46.980 --> 30:54.700
You actually bump into the back of John Lee Kevin Moore the third from behind somehow and the two of you fall

30:54.900 --> 30:59.060
Kind of into the same room that has nothing in it except for

30:59.780 --> 31:01.780
dr. Marie Jacobs and

31:02.340 --> 31:04.340
Doug Jacobs

31:04.940 --> 31:07.180
Clark I thought you were in front of me

31:10.780 --> 31:12.460
Let's try that next hatch

31:12.460 --> 31:19.340
What do I see when I look behind me first you see a junkyard of a room with and you can hear the cries of?

31:19.940 --> 31:25.100
Yeah, go go go to that door that door that door and I'm kind of pushing you along to go out the next door and as

31:25.100 --> 31:28.980
You go through it. You run through the same room again. Both of you are all sanity

31:31.980 --> 31:33.980
Hey 17

31:34.980 --> 31:41.660
Nice hey 10 I passed I do a 10 on an 11 lose 10 lose 10

31:50.340 --> 31:52.340
I need one of you

31:52.380 --> 31:58.980
Lose any as you realize nope this is exactly how this room works. Oh, okay, so it's just like a loop through that door

31:58.980 --> 32:00.980
It's just a loop thing a loop

32:01.500 --> 32:05.660
Loopy loop. Oh, it's like it's a lag. Yeah, damn it. So it's just the boat in this

32:06.300 --> 32:10.260
Fucking dawn. I think I owe money or something. It's been a while

32:11.980 --> 32:16.820
He's one of these one of those ones where it's like oh you're spending the day with Uncle Don and then it's like spending the

32:16.820 --> 32:21.300
Day with Uncle Don was four hours in a hot car and then Uncle Don driving you home drunk. I

32:23.100 --> 32:27.220
Mean yeah, he financed my racing career, but also, you know, fuck that dude

32:28.540 --> 32:33.820
Isn't that the that the doctor isn't that the doctor and the the cat man body right there who?

32:34.260 --> 32:41.000
Right there on the floor there. Yes. I see them those those people on the on the ground remind me. Dr

32:41.000 --> 32:44.940
Marie Jacobs and that's Doug Jacobs her husband and he

32:45.780 --> 32:50.540
He's actually Salem her cat remember the radio switch that the Doug Jacobs and the cat

32:53.180 --> 33:00.460
You and she's like caressing his hair Doug Jacobs his head as it lays upon her breast and

33:00.940 --> 33:08.660
They're just staring up into the endless ness above them and you as she kind of looks over and catches your eye

33:09.500 --> 33:10.860
Oh

33:10.860 --> 33:12.380
fuck

33:12.380 --> 33:17.900
Now see Clark, that was a very succinct a very succinct summation as a war

33:17.900 --> 33:23.420
I was just asking for the benefit of folks who might not have ever heard any kind of recap about this sort of story

33:24.420 --> 33:25.660
you

33:25.660 --> 33:28.940
absolute total fucking pieces of garbage

33:30.060 --> 33:36.040
Sorry doctor police officers my ass. You're gonna lock us up when we're in love

33:37.040 --> 33:40.840
And that's why we're here oh wait, okay, so

33:41.600 --> 33:43.600
If we wouldn't have been locked up we wouldn't be here

33:43.720 --> 33:47.000
Hey fair enough, but you weren't locked up because you were in love

33:47.000 --> 33:50.480
But if you are admitting right now to being in love with your cat

33:50.840 --> 33:54.480
Even though he's in the body of that man. That is a crime. I am so sorry

33:54.480 --> 34:02.480
You cannot what part of it is a crime loving your animal. You said we're in love that that replies that implies romance

34:02.740 --> 34:05.580
You see I love my friends. I love my partner

34:06.840 --> 34:11.040
Clark here, but we're not in love. I love you too, John

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
Yeah, thanks, man

34:16.520 --> 34:18.520
Thank you, I

34:18.720 --> 34:23.840
Think I think we actually we yeah, we we kind of went over this but when we first

34:24.120 --> 34:28.160
There I we don't know that there's a crime here, but it doesn't feel like it's

34:29.840 --> 34:35.440
Doesn't feel like it's not a crime. Yeah, I am getting a real sense of deja vu with this conversation

34:35.480 --> 34:39.780
But ma'am once again like while I understand the appeal of having a cat

34:39.780 --> 34:44.680
Will you just leave us in a person-sized body and just like rolling around on the floor with that?

34:45.200 --> 34:50.200
When you start to say like I'm in we're in love that implies a level of

34:50.720 --> 34:54.840
NFC being reached with that body that I don't think is appropriate

34:55.360 --> 34:59.400
Either for the original owner of that body the cat's mind. That's now in it

34:59.400 --> 35:01.400
Or

35:01.400 --> 35:07.780
God frankly or God. Yeah, that's not what Asian on this relationship without knowing anything about us

35:08.680 --> 35:14.800
Hmm. Well, then maybe just be more careful with your words, you know, no, it's like a cat mine in a human body

35:14.800 --> 35:20.480
That's that. Yeah, I don't know the the context and we see you rolling around on the floor there. I'm not trying

35:21.000 --> 35:23.640
Yeah, I guess I am trying to yuck your yum

35:24.480 --> 35:26.480
This this is yucky

35:27.480 --> 35:34.680
And she kisses Doug Jacobs on the head and goes and looks directly in your eyes and says yummy

35:37.640 --> 35:45.460
You know, there was nothing inherently gross about you kissing your cat man on the head until you said yummy again

35:45.460 --> 35:48.520
It's just the way you're approaching all of this. That is very

35:49.080 --> 35:54.400
It just seems like it's coming from the wrong angle. It's not making me comfortable at all good

35:55.240 --> 35:59.280
Go away what doctor help? How long have you been here?

36:00.400 --> 36:07.880
She looks up into the stars above that don't exist. I've been here forever. I

36:08.760 --> 36:10.760
Was born here. I

36:11.160 --> 36:15.640
Will die here and when I die, I will remain here

36:16.720 --> 36:20.880
Well, I don't I don't think that's the case because we had you in a jail cell. We just talked about that

36:20.880 --> 36:24.640
So you weren't yeah, you're literally talking about yeah your memories with us

36:25.640 --> 36:28.840
Outside of here, so you won't remain here. Oh

36:32.040 --> 36:37.280
Sorry you cut out on the discord call of little faith, oh you just didn't finish your sentence

36:38.000 --> 36:41.100
In a normal time you Michael borrowed it

36:42.520 --> 36:45.280
Really just sounded like you got cut right off. So

36:46.440 --> 36:48.520
Is it clear that my?

36:50.880 --> 36:52.880
Intention

36:54.200 --> 36:56.200
Is to annoy you

36:58.120 --> 37:04.320
Yeah, you know ma'am personally, you know, I don't she begins licking the hair of Doug Jacobs, oh

37:05.480 --> 37:11.380
Yeah, again, that doesn't bug me cuz that just seems like if she's being a cat like I don't know

37:11.400 --> 37:16.960
We're all cats down here. What bugs me is when she implies that she fucks the cat. I'm with you

37:16.960 --> 37:18.200
I'm with you on that and she's like

37:18.200 --> 37:24.600
Why do you think I'm applying that and then she implies it more and I don't care about rolling around with your big cat, man

37:24.800 --> 37:28.000
That sounds enjoyable and adorable. I

37:28.800 --> 37:31.880
Just don't don't fuck the cat man. Don't I

37:33.960 --> 37:38.360
Just cross a line from time to time every now and then she does imply that there's a line being crossed

37:38.600 --> 37:41.400
Yeah, it seems like a cat man's getting fucked

37:45.200 --> 37:48.400
Scratch his ears, you know lick his hair. All right, whatever

37:49.080 --> 37:54.080
Rub his whiskers, but he does both don't please don't fucking have whiskers anymore

37:54.320 --> 37:57.580
Please I was being I was being you know imaginative

37:57.580 --> 38:05.060
I was being playful like the spirit being very imaginative when you keep talking about me fucking this cat when

38:05.060 --> 38:08.660
It seems like that's all you want to think about to be fair

38:10.660 --> 38:15.620
Yeah, exactly I knew it I'm not gonna engage with you because you know exactly what you're doing

38:15.620 --> 38:18.540
So I'm not just gonna get in little word games with you where you're like

38:18.540 --> 38:23.180
Oh, you're the one who wants to fuck cat cuz you're the one fucking this cat apparently

38:25.620 --> 38:28.680
It's good to know that setting doesn't change the show at all

38:28.680 --> 38:30.680
On

38:34.640 --> 38:36.640
That note I think I'm gonna switch back over

38:41.720 --> 38:43.720
She's getting to a point where we could

38:47.960 --> 38:51.000
Yep, this is about the right time to switch

38:52.120 --> 38:54.680
But could we real quick just ask her some questions?

38:55.120 --> 38:58.760
Like I literally just want to be like if she can engage with me on a real level

38:58.760 --> 39:02.760
I want to just be like, what are your impressions having been here? Okay fucking do it

39:03.400 --> 39:08.760
Maybe you fuck that cat. Maybe you don't let us put that aside for a moment

39:09.240 --> 39:13.000
Petty more. I didn't know you were from here. Now. What do you mean by that?

39:13.520 --> 39:17.120
Bishop look at his face. I look at his face Clark

39:17.120 --> 39:24.120
You can clearly see just the the booze that's pouring out of his eyes and his ears and his nose and his mouth

39:24.360 --> 39:31.880
Is the same inky dark substance that is extremely colorful at the same time. It's like dripping down from my eyes

39:31.880 --> 39:36.140
Oh, yeah, do I look really fucking goth and badass? You look so

39:37.320 --> 39:39.960
Cool, you're also in like Kevin's body

39:39.960 --> 39:47.040
Which is like scarred up and you're in all black tactical gear like and I think canonically he was described

39:48.840 --> 39:50.840
As Sam Elliott in Roadhouse

39:51.840 --> 39:53.840
Oh my god he was

39:53.840 --> 39:56.480
So Sam Elliott in Roadhouse but in like

39:57.200 --> 39:58.640
an

39:58.640 --> 40:00.640
amazing and possibly like

40:00.960 --> 40:03.440
multi-fluorescent goth makeup just like

40:04.120 --> 40:08.260
Streaming down his face Clark recoils John John your face

40:08.260 --> 40:12.600
It's like you didn't even notice it Clark before but you knew like it was there

40:12.600 --> 40:18.100
But you didn't know and it wasn't there at all because when you look into someone's face you see

40:18.540 --> 40:24.700
What you know their face to be right you don't really see what they look like, you know, you see who they are

40:24.820 --> 40:28.460
John you're you're you've got to you got something under your eye

40:29.220 --> 40:36.740
It's it. I don't know. It's maybe it's maybe it's all maybe it's always been there. I don't I just never noticed that

40:38.640 --> 40:40.640
You know this stuff around us

40:41.100 --> 40:43.340
It's on you pass me your pocket mirror

40:43.340 --> 40:49.900
Here's my compact I open Clark's compact and I take a look do I see yeah you see

40:50.900 --> 40:52.620
Does it does it hurt?

40:52.620 --> 40:59.620
He says it John's not quite responding, but you do see that he's crying again and it's kind of like

41:00.260 --> 41:03.100
Those juggernauts here is he's not upset

41:04.220 --> 41:06.740
That doesn't doesn't hurt

41:09.100 --> 41:11.100
Look at me look at my glorious

41:13.580 --> 41:15.580
Look at my glorious war paint

41:18.380 --> 41:20.380
It

41:20.740 --> 41:25.640
It's it it kind of suits you it's like I it's like I'm seeing you for real

41:26.580 --> 41:31.860
It doesn't startle me the way I thought that it should I'm at this place. It's uh

41:33.620 --> 41:38.660
You're here like a you're like a part of it, I don't understand John but it's

41:39.820 --> 41:42.860
Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's it's you

41:43.340 --> 41:46.620
He turns to dr. Marie Jacobs and it's like

41:47.540 --> 41:49.540
Yeah, I'm from here

42:13.340 --> 42:15.340
What

42:43.340 --> 42:45.340
You
