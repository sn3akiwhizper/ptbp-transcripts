00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
Happy Friday, babies!

00:01.920 --> 00:05.300
It's December 6th in PTBP time,

00:05.300 --> 00:08.460
but it's Friday time in yo' time.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.920
My producer wanted to let y'all know

00:10.920 --> 00:14.220
that we are on a Friday release schedule now.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.220
I'm sure it's so they can get up

00:16.220 --> 00:19.220
to all sorts of debauchery on the weekends

00:19.220 --> 00:23.680
without having to worry about producing this fine program,

00:23.680 --> 00:26.060
or something like that.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.320
I don't know, the producer never speaks to me anymore.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.300
They just kind of ominously glare at me

00:32.300 --> 00:36.140
while emitting white noise frequencies to frighten me.

00:36.140 --> 00:38.440
Last week was regrettable.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.100
I ate so much chowder

00:40.100 --> 00:43.640
that I vomited continuously for a week straight.

00:43.640 --> 00:47.560
I was empty, so very empty.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.040
My stomach became an endless void

00:50.040 --> 00:53.280
devoid of all hope and sustenance.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.280
But y'all know what that means.

00:55.280 --> 00:58.080
Just more room for clam gravy.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.460
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Lady Betavir,

01:01.460 --> 01:04.840
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.960
She writes,

01:05.960 --> 01:10.420
"'Dear Wolf, as my favorite time-traveling pirate radio host,

01:10.420 --> 01:12.340
"'I was hoping that you could settle a debate

01:12.340 --> 01:14.640
"'I've been having with some of my friends.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.800
"'Recently, we got into a highly theoretical

01:17.800 --> 01:20.020
"'and not at all realistic discussion

01:20.020 --> 01:21.440
"'of whether it was impolite

01:21.440 --> 01:24.020
"'to decline food offered to you on a visit,

01:24.020 --> 01:27.280
"'particularly when your host was an elderly man

01:27.300 --> 01:30.640
"'who may or may not be involved in a grisly murder,

01:30.640 --> 01:32.020
"'and the food is a bladder

01:32.020 --> 01:34.460
"'of incredibly questionable cold cuts,

01:34.460 --> 01:37.420
"'olives, and warm baby vegetables.

01:37.420 --> 01:40.200
"'My friend Ellery and I both agreed

01:40.200 --> 01:42.300
"'that it was better not to eat anything

01:42.300 --> 01:45.040
"'than to risk vomiting in front of your host,

01:45.040 --> 01:47.160
"'but our friend Brew insisted

01:47.160 --> 01:49.500
"'that it would be too rude to decline,

01:49.500 --> 01:52.200
"'even if the olives seem to be looking at you

01:52.200 --> 01:54.460
"'and the carrots have fingernails,

01:54.460 --> 01:56.940
"'so we could just not all agree.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.380
"'Now, I usually ask my handler,

01:59.380 --> 02:02.680
"'er, my good fishing buddy, Lord Bonk,

02:02.680 --> 02:04.360
"'about this kind of etiquette,

02:04.360 --> 02:05.420
"'but when I brought it up,

02:05.420 --> 02:07.440
"'he began mumbling under his breath

02:07.440 --> 02:11.100
"'in some language with too many damn consonants,

02:11.100 --> 02:12.620
"'like Welsh, maybe,

02:12.620 --> 02:15.420
"'and rolling his eyes into the back of his head,

02:15.420 --> 02:18.420
"'so I suspect he's not entirely sure either.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.360
"'Do you have any insight to share

02:20.360 --> 02:23.340
"'on the proper behavior for this oddly specific

02:23.340 --> 02:25.640
"'and completely made-up scenario

02:25.660 --> 02:28.160
"'that certainly has not happened to any of us?

02:28.160 --> 02:31.760
"'Thanks from another loyal listener, Lady Bettevere.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.180
"'P.S., if you ever get a hold of anyone

02:34.180 --> 02:36.780
"'from the contention police department again,

02:36.780 --> 02:39.200
"'please give them our kind regards.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.560
"'We'd love to bring them

02:40.560 --> 02:43.400
"'some completely unquestionable cookies,

02:43.400 --> 02:46.660
"'but we haven't seen anyone at the station for two days,

02:46.660 --> 02:48.300
"'or six months.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.960
"'I'm actually not sure which it is,

02:49.960 --> 02:52.160
"'but we miss them all the same.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.200
"'Greetings, loyal listener Lady Bettevere.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.840
"'In this house, we always eat whatever is given to us,

02:59.840 --> 03:03.440
"'for the meat of man is still meat nonetheless,

03:03.440 --> 03:06.040
"'and all meat is good.

03:06.040 --> 03:09.400
"'And though you might vomit, worry not, children,

03:09.400 --> 03:13.140
"'as that is but a sign of respect in the House of Wolf.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.680
"'So I'm on Baby Brew's side,

03:15.680 --> 03:17.120
"'and ask your old fishing buddy

03:17.120 --> 03:19.420
"'to quit being a fucking weirdo.

03:19.420 --> 03:23.820
"'Also, drop them unquestionable cookies off at my address.

03:23.840 --> 03:28.000
"'Just smell around, I'm sure you'll find my abode.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.820
"'To grow this show, send a memo to all that you know,

03:31.820 --> 03:35.720
"'even your foe, to say hello to our fine audio.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.380
"'And if you got dough, a Patreon subscription

03:38.380 --> 03:40.400
"'would blow Wolf to and fro,

03:40.400 --> 03:44.640
"'hitting falsetto while dancing flamenco on a rainbow.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.680
"'From high in the sky to low and slow,

03:47.680 --> 03:52.060
"'I'm on a booze cruise to soothe the news.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.640
"'On the last episode, holiday hijinks

03:54.640 --> 03:57.140
"'led Clark Bishop and Leon Simpson,

03:57.140 --> 04:00.460
"'along with their new friend, Donovan something,

04:00.460 --> 04:03.740
"'to the dorm room of Harriet Marks and Amelia Locke,

04:03.740 --> 04:07.980
"'where Keith had information and John had changed.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.760
"'In the room across the hall,

04:09.760 --> 04:12.660
"'the group banged out the melody of Jingle Bells,

04:12.660 --> 04:16.000
"'turned and saw the bell tower in the middle of the campus,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.880
"'dressed in lights, wreaths,

04:17.880 --> 04:21.000
"'and topped with a giant minion inflatable.

04:21.020 --> 04:24.380
"'Just a reminder that it is December 6th here in the city,

04:24.380 --> 04:27.600
"'so the whole holiday cheer thing is appropriate.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.340
"'Kazoo with no backbone.'"

04:29.340 --> 04:50.600
["The

04:52.000 --> 04:54.860
And we're back in the groove, boys."

04:54.860 --> 04:56.220
Ready to click record.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.100
As you finish hammering out the tune to Jingle Bells

05:00.100 --> 05:02.620
on this Casio keyboard, you hear the bell tower

05:02.620 --> 05:05.820
in the center of campus ring out as well.

05:05.820 --> 05:08.400
You see through the window of this dorm room,

05:08.400 --> 05:13.080
the bell tower lights up in a congratulatory glow,

05:13.080 --> 05:16.540
and snow begins to fall.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.100
I think we need to go to there.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.620
But that's just a weather thing.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.000
That's just a John thing.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.160
I turn away from the camera and I kind of like

05:25.160 --> 05:26.800
smile and wink to myself.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.620
Another camera gets it and you totally Jim the camera.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.820
It's all about making moments in my line of work.

05:36.540 --> 05:40.240
So is the plan to go to the Jingle Ball or,

05:40.240 --> 05:43.720
I mean, we can assume that if this Alicia Locke,

05:43.720 --> 05:44.560
what was her name?

05:44.560 --> 05:45.400
Amelia.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.080
Amelia Clark is down there,

05:49.100 --> 05:53.540
then we can only assume that she's got more information

05:53.540 --> 05:55.040
at least that we can talk to her.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.060
So I guess we need to.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.840
Yeah, I think she's probably the first one to get there.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.380
So let's finish these clues and go talk to her.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.760
We'll head to the bell tower.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.380
Should we take the stairs or the elevator?

06:04.380 --> 06:05.500
Not the elevator, it sounds like.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.340
Yeah, probably not.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.060
I'll just walk to not embarrass you.

06:08.060 --> 06:09.160
As opposed to what?

06:11.140 --> 06:16.000
He says that and John like rapidly rolls on all fours,

06:16.000 --> 06:17.060
like out of the room.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.880
What?

06:18.880 --> 06:19.780
Rolls?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.720
Yeah, he gets down and like,

06:23.060 --> 06:28.060
he gets down into a ball and he rolls out of the room.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.400
And then he turns around and he like winks at Donovan.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.760
And he's like, roll sanity, Donovan.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.520
I look at Clark and I'm like,

06:38.520 --> 06:41.480
I'm thinking that body fucked him up a little bit.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.280
Yeah, no shit, Keith, what the fuck?

06:44.280 --> 06:46.760
But yeah, let's take the stairs to avoid

06:47.300 --> 06:48.700
maybe that happening to you.

06:49.940 --> 06:50.840
And away we go.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.980
Walking across the campus, you see that the-

06:53.980 --> 06:55.620
Walking and rolling.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.020
I'm so sorry.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.380
I'm walking next to you.

06:58.380 --> 07:01.100
I was rolling to demonstrate how much more quickly

07:01.100 --> 07:04.620
I would get places using my preferred method

07:04.620 --> 07:06.220
of transportation.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.220
Jesus Christ.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.020
You guys are walking and not rolling,

07:11.020 --> 07:12.420
rolling mentally maybe?

07:12.420 --> 07:15.060
You guys are walking to the bell tower,

07:15.080 --> 07:16.960
which is nearby on campus.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.800
And you pass many a holiday accoutrement on your way there.

07:20.800 --> 07:25.800
And the snow falling has made it a really delightful evening

07:25.960 --> 07:28.680
even though it is quite quiet on this campus,

07:28.680 --> 07:33.600
except for the distant noises of holiday cheer and screaming.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.240
Other than that, it's quiet though.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.520
Besides the cheer and the screaming.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.080
Have you fellas noticed how much screaming

07:40.080 --> 07:41.240
is happening around us?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.280
No, not until just now.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.700
When we were first entered that gifts hall,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.820
that gifts house-

07:49.820 --> 07:50.740
Is that a dinosaur?

07:50.740 --> 07:53.400
Donovan walked into a room, flipped on the light,

07:53.400 --> 07:54.880
and a real creepy little dude said,

07:54.880 --> 07:56.540
turn off that light.

07:56.540 --> 07:59.020
And we did and got the hell out of there.

07:59.020 --> 07:59.860
What?

07:59.860 --> 08:01.180
You didn't investigate it?

08:02.300 --> 08:04.340
It scared us.

08:04.340 --> 08:05.160
What?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.700
We'll have to go back to that.

08:06.700 --> 08:07.620
You remember that Donovan?

08:07.620 --> 08:10.240
Yeah, I don't actually remember if it was a boy or a girl

08:10.240 --> 08:12.420
so much as a shadowy entity.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.940
And I just wasn't done with it.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.320
I didn't really want to deal with that.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.440
I just figured that all these screams

08:16.440 --> 08:19.440
were coming from people in dark rooms and it scared us.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.640
So we turned off the light real quick.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.680
Well, that would have been nice to know,

08:23.680 --> 08:28.680
but we'll get back to that, I guess.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.360
And I continue walking towards the bell tower.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.220
You guys make your way to an old stone bell tower

08:35.220 --> 08:40.040
with a large gated entrance that is built into the rock

08:40.060 --> 08:44.980
and stone formation that is forming this quite small,

08:44.980 --> 08:49.980
cylindrical, phallic shape that it reaches

08:50.260 --> 08:53.100
into the night December sky.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.760
And the door has a gate right there.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.140
There's a gate on the door, there's a door on the gate.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.540
It's just a gate, it's not a door, and it's open.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.420
I walk on in.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.260
I follow.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.260
So this is a dark stairwell.

09:05.260 --> 09:09.380
It is open all the way up like a silo in the middle,

09:09.600 --> 09:14.600
but there are these stone stairs that go in a spiral upward

09:15.400 --> 09:17.040
to the very top.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.880
Thomas is just drawing circles in his notes.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.500
It's really horrifying.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.000
Who's first?

09:25.000 --> 09:25.840
Who's going first?

09:25.840 --> 09:26.660
Keith Vigna's going first.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.500
I'm going to go first.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.120
And Keith Vigna, you about halfway up,

09:30.120 --> 09:34.180
you see that there is a corpse on the stairwell.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.960
I look back, I'm like, close your eyes, guys.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.300
You're not going to want to see this.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.240
Close our eyes?

09:40.100 --> 09:40.940
Just trust me.

09:40.940 --> 09:41.780
Looking past Keith Vigna.

09:41.780 --> 09:44.500
Technically, I don't have eyes, but I'll humor you.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.980
At this point, Keith is kind of like worried about Jon,

09:48.980 --> 09:51.520
but also like, okay, whatever.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.340
The world worries for me and I worry for the world

09:54.340 --> 09:57.060
and neither of us can do a thing to help the other.

09:59.060 --> 10:01.500
The corpse is wearing a security guard uniform.

10:04.260 --> 10:05.280
And it's dead.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.580
Guys, just close your eyes and keep going up the stairs.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.720
And I stand by the corpse to kind of guide them past it.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.200
I want to stop at Keith standing by the corpse.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.920
I grab him by the shoulders.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.200
Worry not about this vessel.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.060
I'm not about you?

10:21.060 --> 10:23.320
It is as much here as it ever was.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.780
And it is not here.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.080
Like it always wasn't.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.700
Come up the stairs.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.880
Let's go, Keith.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.360
Same as it ever was.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.780
There is water at the bottom of the ocean.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.740
Keith is like just-

10:38.200 --> 10:39.320
Pretty weirded out.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.640
All right, Clark, come on.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.200
Get past this and let's keep going.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.040
I go past.

10:43.040 --> 10:43.860
Okay.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.200
I'm keeping my eyes open.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.040
Okay.

10:46.040 --> 10:46.860
Okay.

10:46.860 --> 10:47.700
Nothing happens to me?

10:47.700 --> 10:48.540
Nope.

10:48.540 --> 10:49.360
Keith, I can look at the body, it seems like.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.200
Okay, good.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.040
I just didn't want-

10:51.040 --> 10:51.860
It's face down.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.560
You don't see any like blood or anything.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.940
It's just a face down body.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.500
So yeah, I mean, you could assume it's sleeping

10:57.500 --> 10:59.320
if you want to rationalize it that way,

10:59.320 --> 11:02.200
but you know based on the world that you've been living in

11:02.200 --> 11:05.520
for the past however many, you know, whatevers.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.360
It's probably dead.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.580
Are there numbers and stuff all in this place too?

11:10.580 --> 11:11.420
Any on the body?

11:11.420 --> 11:12.700
Oh yeah, there's some on the body.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.380
Anything that we've seen before?

11:14.380 --> 11:15.220
Is it all-

11:15.220 --> 11:18.280
Oh baby, we're in the wild west of numbers.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.480
I turn back to Donovan.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.140
Hey Donovan, you might, Keith's warning here,

11:22.140 --> 11:23.660
you might want to shut them eyes.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.860
Donovan is staring directly at the body.

11:28.740 --> 11:31.020
But he's not like super phased by it

11:31.020 --> 11:33.020
and he just like steps over it.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.340
Oh, that was Jerry.

11:35.340 --> 11:36.660
Didn't much care for him.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.560
You actually see he's got a,

11:38.560 --> 11:41.200
there is a notepad in Jerry's hand.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.020
Who me?

11:42.020 --> 11:42.860
Yeah.

11:42.860 --> 11:43.700
Oh, couldn't be.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.520
Do some investigating.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.800
Hey, what is this?

11:45.800 --> 11:46.620
Picks it up.

11:46.620 --> 11:50.120
It's just a to-do list for tomorrow and it says retire.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.380
Poor bastard.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.700
It was wise of you to look closer.

11:58.700 --> 12:01.060
I set up all kinds of jokes like these.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.640
I continue up the stairs.

12:04.140 --> 12:07.060
Clark, your friend's freaking me out.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.320
John, you set this up?

12:10.320 --> 12:11.320
Did you?

12:11.320 --> 12:12.780
Keith, did he ever leave your sight?

12:12.780 --> 12:14.220
He never did, no.

12:14.220 --> 12:16.240
I laugh as they try to understand.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.740
I don't know what's going on with him.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.420
I think he might've had a break.

12:19.420 --> 12:20.620
You don't say.

12:20.620 --> 12:21.500
Holy shit.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.620
Let's keep going.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.500
As you approach the top of the tower,

12:24.500 --> 12:26.700
you hear a voice that is mumbling.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.540
And that's just right, I just,

12:28.540 --> 12:32.980
42 can't find it, you know?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.280
If we can't get higher from this perspective,

12:35.280 --> 12:37.520
then we gotta figure it out later.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.360
Hello?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.200
Hello?

12:39.200 --> 12:40.020
Oh, yes.

12:40.020 --> 12:40.860
Oh my goodness.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.700
Yes, peoples.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.520
Yes, come on over.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.240
Come on over to the top of the tower, please.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.320
Can I see this person?

12:46.320 --> 12:47.600
Yeah, as you approach,

12:47.600 --> 12:52.240
it is an attractive girl who is in college age,

12:52.240 --> 12:53.280
early twenties.

12:53.280 --> 12:57.220
And she has two boobies.

12:59.080 --> 12:59.920
God damn it.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.760
No.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.620
She has two buns on the back of her head, on her hair.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.940
It's like grade A, grade A content.

13:11.940 --> 13:12.780
And uh.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.780
Subscribe to the Patreon.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.060
Oh, thank you.

13:19.060 --> 13:21.180
Luke cams on it.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.180
I just want you to hear.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.080
Oh, we're gonna make so much money.

13:30.080 --> 13:30.920
On the Luke cam.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.640
On the Luke cam.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.400
Would you guys please help me get to the top of the tower?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.280
And she's like got her hands on her head

13:37.280 --> 13:39.880
and her eyes are wide and she's looking at all of you like,

13:39.880 --> 13:43.160
oh my God, if you could just please take me to the two forts.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.160
I can't take you to the top of the tower,

13:45.160 --> 13:48.120
that'd be, that would just be fucking tits.

13:48.140 --> 13:51.540
I look at her and I close my eyes and nod my head.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.540
And is she still there when I open my eyes?

13:53.540 --> 13:54.820
Everyone pull out your headphones

13:54.820 --> 13:56.340
and then cover your ears real quick.

13:56.340 --> 14:01.020
Hey Thomas, when John closes his eyes,

14:01.020 --> 14:05.460
he just sees a mass of numbers flash before them.

14:05.460 --> 14:10.220
And then he sees the visage of Clark Bishop age rapidly

14:10.220 --> 14:14.420
and then age and reverse Benjamin Button style back down.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.600
And then you see your own face take over for his face,

14:18.600 --> 14:22.040
age in the same way and then age in reverse.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.860
The beautiful topography of time.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.480
As you open your eyes, she's still there.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.360
And she's like, I don't think it,

14:30.360 --> 14:32.780
can anyone get me to the top physically

14:32.780 --> 14:34.400
with their bodies and hands and stuff?

14:34.400 --> 14:35.240
What's your name?

14:35.240 --> 14:38.920
Oh, my name is Sham Wow.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.880
That's unfortunate.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.440
No, it's Sham Wow Chameleon.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.520
You didn't hear the whole thing.

14:43.520 --> 14:44.520
Fucking millennials.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.980
What's at the top?

14:48.980 --> 14:50.140
Higher than this.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.100
I'm just trying to get higher, baby.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.780
Gotta take me higher.

14:53.780 --> 14:55.620
Four, three, two, six.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.500
Well, why do you need somebody to take you up there?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.660
Well, because it's harder for me to do it

14:59.660 --> 15:00.780
because I can't climb this rope.

15:00.780 --> 15:04.940
And she points at the rope that the giant bell is on.

15:04.940 --> 15:07.380
I'm afraid if I jump onto the bell by myself,

15:07.380 --> 15:10.260
I won't be able to climb all the way and I'll fall and die.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.260
I don't wanna fall and die.

15:11.260 --> 15:12.620
So I wanna get to the top of the tower.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.720
I wanna get higher tippy top.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.640
If you had to think of any numbers in the universe,

15:15.640 --> 15:16.480
what would they be?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.560
Clark is getting his punching hand ready?

15:18.560 --> 15:20.360
Immediately Leon Simpson puts on

15:20.360 --> 15:22.400
his noise canceling headphones.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.040
Are we at the top of this other than like climbing

15:25.040 --> 15:25.880
up the rope to the bell?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.080
Are we at the top of the tower?

15:27.080 --> 15:27.920
Yes.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.740
Cool.

15:28.740 --> 15:29.580
There's lots of names.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.700
There's numbers.

15:32.700 --> 15:33.960
There's so many numbers.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.040
They're inside my brain

15:35.040 --> 15:36.840
and they keep coming out all over the place.

15:36.840 --> 15:40.680
And you would not believe the week ahead,

15:40.700 --> 15:43.700
but I guess like if I had to think about the ones

15:43.700 --> 15:44.940
that speak to me most truly,

15:44.940 --> 15:49.940
it would be 811-818-9520-1318-1119.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.720
And all the rest of them are also in here,

15:52.720 --> 15:54.340
but they're all over the place sideways

15:54.340 --> 15:55.860
and on top of each other.

15:55.860 --> 15:59.020
And it's just constant and it's all inside,

15:59.020 --> 15:59.860
but I gotta get higher.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.260
Was that Harriet?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.100
Yeah.

16:02.100 --> 16:02.920
I'm pretty sure it was.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.760
Harriet.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.580
Oh, you know Harriet.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.420
Did you?

16:05.420 --> 16:06.260
I know Harriet.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.100
I know you.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.380
I know everyone on your campus.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.620
I know your mother, your father.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.280
That's wild.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.480
You know, the chameleons.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.640
John, thanks for a minute.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.120
And it's like, they're not coming to mind right now,

16:17.120 --> 16:18.720
but yes, of course.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.560
Wow.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.380
Did you know Harriet?

16:20.380 --> 16:21.220
Marks?

16:21.220 --> 16:22.060
Yeah, yeah.

16:22.060 --> 16:22.880
Yeah, I mean, not too many people

16:22.880 --> 16:25.020
are named Harriet these days.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.080
Can you get me higher?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.280
What do you need up there for?

16:27.280 --> 16:28.520
I just gotta get higher.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.520
Number one.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.800
Number one, I gotta get higher.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.560
Are you working on the scavenger hunt?

16:34.560 --> 16:35.940
Yes, for sure.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.360
But most importantly, gotta get higher than I am here.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.740
This is the highest spot I've been

16:39.760 --> 16:41.040
and the highest spot I can be,

16:41.040 --> 16:42.600
but I could get higher with you guys' help

16:42.600 --> 16:43.760
if you wanna help me get higher.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.520
Do you know what would happen if you got higher?

16:45.520 --> 16:46.720
Feel good.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.080
I wanna look around and see if I can find like a clue

16:49.080 --> 16:50.600
that would have led us here.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.280
She grabs onto Donovan's like shirt

16:54.280 --> 16:55.960
and is like, take me higher.

16:55.960 --> 16:58.500
I don't, no, I don't wanna talk to you.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.600
Roll search for me.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.440
What are you looking for?

17:00.440 --> 17:02.960
Just like another clue, like why we came up here.

17:02.960 --> 17:03.800
Sure.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.620
35 on a 40.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.040
Yeah, so looking out from the bell tower,

17:07.060 --> 17:10.500
you very clearly see across the way,

17:10.500 --> 17:14.740
there is a sleigh that is completely lit up in lights

17:14.740 --> 17:17.900
that is on top of a building across campus,

17:17.900 --> 17:22.660
which Donovan, you would know is the Accord Student Center.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.140
We drove here in an Accord.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.200
You think there's any connection?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.740
Donovan, what's that sleigh?

17:26.740 --> 17:27.940
That's the Accord Student Center.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.100
That's where a lot of people meet up.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.620
Perhaps a ball could be there?

17:31.620 --> 17:34.820
In the sleigh is a brightly lit sign

17:34.840 --> 17:37.560
that points to a light up chimney.

17:37.560 --> 17:42.560
And the sign says in all caps, the jingle ball is this way.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.080
You guys, I think that might be where we need to go next.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.920
Are you telling me we did a scavenger hunt

17:47.920 --> 17:50.960
to be told that the jingle ball was at the student union?

17:53.120 --> 17:55.500
And that we're all balls are held?

17:55.500 --> 17:59.280
Yeah, what's the problem is a really hard rule to solve.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.360
Hey, y'all remember how we might all be balls?

18:01.360 --> 18:02.440
You think there's something to do that?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.220
Jingle balls, balls.

18:04.760 --> 18:05.820
I'm not convinced I'm ball.

18:05.820 --> 18:08.080
Let's go back to that.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.760
You said that you're all balls?

18:09.760 --> 18:11.200
No, my child.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.520
Can you take me higher?

18:12.520 --> 18:14.360
You're all balls though?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.200
Would you just do the top of the thing?

18:16.200 --> 18:19.160
I'm sorry, you said that you all were balls.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.160
You'd like to be.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.440
I just need to get on top of this bell tower

18:22.440 --> 18:23.280
as fast as possible.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.600
I wouldn't listen to John right now.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.100
You can hear how he's been talking some gibberish.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.720
I just, he's just out of it right now.

18:29.720 --> 18:30.560
Well, persuade.

18:31.100 --> 18:35.620
I'd like to confess his rule.

18:35.620 --> 18:36.460
Oh, okay.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.300
You can roll persuade.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.800
Profits are never appreciated in their own time.

18:40.800 --> 18:41.660
No, they die.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.940
I keep sending them though.

18:42.940 --> 18:43.780
81.

18:45.900 --> 18:46.860
Yeah, okay.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.860
That's fair.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.700
I guess balls.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.700
So if you could just take me

18:52.700 --> 18:54.100
to the very top of this bell tower,

18:54.100 --> 18:54.940
it's just right around.

18:54.940 --> 18:56.660
So you see how it's open right here?

18:56.660 --> 18:59.940
I think if you two of you stand right on the edge,

19:00.160 --> 19:03.160
you can hold my feet with your hands on your knees,

19:03.160 --> 19:05.480
maybe thigh, maybe I could get some upper thigh

19:05.480 --> 19:10.080
and then I could work my way up

19:10.080 --> 19:12.960
with my sleek rock climbing abilities

19:12.960 --> 19:15.040
to get even on top of the tower even more.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.920
I'm kind of ignoring this person

19:16.920 --> 19:19.240
and I look at, we don't need to help.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.720
Well, I was thinking we might as well just help her

19:21.720 --> 19:22.920
and then get over the ball.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.520
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.360
I'll see you there.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.640
I have a feeling she's gonna follow us

19:26.640 --> 19:28.440
and annoy us if we don't do this for her.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.880
Plus I just wanna see what happens.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.020
You guys could take me higher

19:33.020 --> 19:35.980
and that's who I wanna be.

19:35.980 --> 19:39.180
If you could take me to the Christmas sky,

19:39.180 --> 19:42.060
I could feel it with all of my might.

19:42.060 --> 19:45.740
I get down to like in the position she told us to get

19:45.740 --> 19:46.980
and I just kind of look over.

19:46.980 --> 19:49.300
I look over at Clark and kind of shrug my shoulders.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.860
I just feel like we're leading this person to their death.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.300
They're gonna fall off that rope.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.820
I look over at Donovan and I'm pointing in front of me

19:55.820 --> 19:57.140
and I shrug my shoulder.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.460
I have an idea.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.080
Clark, will you strike this woman down

20:00.080 --> 20:01.320
as you did the others?

20:04.480 --> 20:05.560
I'm not too bright, Clark,

20:05.560 --> 20:07.680
but I think it would solve all our problems

20:07.680 --> 20:09.000
if you struck this woman.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.640
Clark cracks his knuckles.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.400
It's like, well, that's true.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
I could just knock her out.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.640
John moves in front of her.

20:14.640 --> 20:15.640
If you're gonna knock her out,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.680
we might as well help her keep her dreams.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.920
My savior, take me higher.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.120
John holds his hands up in front of him

20:21.120 --> 20:22.440
and he's like, Clark.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.720
Our John is an awesome John.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.340
He reigns from heaven above with hands.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.420
I keep one hand pointed out to John,

20:31.420 --> 20:34.700
but I put one hand behind me and I put it on her forehead.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.540
Your John.

20:35.540 --> 20:39.300
With her hand on my forehead, take me higher, Satan.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.740
Is anybody gonna help me out here?

20:44.740 --> 20:47.980
Honestly, I have no idea what's happening anymore.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.860
I just feel like if we help her onto this rope,

20:50.860 --> 20:51.700
that's a death sentence for her.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.260
Well, you're gonna punch her, so.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.220
It'd just knock her out though.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.060
That wouldn't kill her.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.680
Just so many potential complications.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.240
We could also just leave.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.080
We don't have to.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.080
No, no, you don't have to leave.

21:02.080 --> 21:02.920
Come on, God.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.980
You're gonna make me leave with your hand upon my skin?

21:07.980 --> 21:09.000
I will help you, my child.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.560
And Keith Vigner, are you gonna help us out?

21:10.560 --> 21:11.520
Yeah, I'm gonna help too.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.360
Sick.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.720
All right, so between the two of you,

21:14.720 --> 21:17.440
who has the better luck?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.840
I have 35 him.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.000
I'll have you roll it.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.120
A three.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.020
Oh!

21:27.100 --> 21:29.420
You help her out the little opening

21:29.420 --> 21:31.440
that's looking out onto the campus,

21:31.440 --> 21:34.020
and she is starting to climb up,

21:34.020 --> 21:38.540
clearly misses with one of her hands and begins to fall,

21:38.540 --> 21:40.580
but you catch her legs,

21:40.580 --> 21:42.780
and she immediately holds on with both

21:42.780 --> 21:44.500
and then fucking sends it,

21:44.500 --> 21:49.220
getting a full grip of the gargantuan inflatable minion

21:49.220 --> 21:52.400
that tops this CSU bell tower.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.300
You hear the swooshing of final coated nylon,

21:56.300 --> 21:57.540
and then...

21:57.540 --> 21:58.380
I'm higher!

21:59.620 --> 22:02.100
Ooh, yeah, eight, one, whoa, ooh, yeah,

22:02.100 --> 22:04.220
it's fun, four, five, six, seven, eight,

22:04.220 --> 22:07.100
kind of, you gotta get it up on the sky

22:07.100 --> 22:08.900
with the Christmas spirit,

22:08.900 --> 22:12.380
and my God fell into helping me aware

22:12.380 --> 22:17.020
whose phone is ringing while we're recording a podcast.

22:17.020 --> 22:17.860
Fucking Justin.

22:17.860 --> 22:20.100
I'm sorry, it's all right, I'm hearing it.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.100
Oh, there we go.

22:22.600 --> 22:26.080
Are we good now, is that, is it over?

22:26.080 --> 22:28.920
Yeah, I feel better, let's go to the ball.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.060
Yeah, let's head on down.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.400
It's time to finally get my prize I deserve.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.520
How is she gonna get down from up there though, guys?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.000
She got up there pretty easily, so.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.220
With the help, okay.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.560
The world works in mysterious ways.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.200
I go down the stairs.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.120
You see the security guard on your way back.

22:46.120 --> 22:46.960
Hey, Jerry.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.680
Same spot, but he'll hop over.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.560
And then at the bottom of the staircase,

22:50.580 --> 22:55.020
you guys enter the, essentially the quad of this campus,

22:55.020 --> 22:58.340
and you head over to the Accord Student Union

22:58.340 --> 23:00.900
that is just across the way.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.620
And as you walk up to it,

23:02.620 --> 23:05.060
you see that there are a couple different entrances.

23:05.060 --> 23:05.900
There are three in front of you.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.780
You can go left, center, or right.

23:08.780 --> 23:09.820
Are any of them lit?

23:09.820 --> 23:11.580
John just walked straight through the center door

23:11.580 --> 23:12.860
without waiting for discussion.

23:12.860 --> 23:13.700
Right on.

23:13.700 --> 23:14.860
Follow John?

23:14.860 --> 23:15.740
I guess.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.980
Yeah, I'll follow John, are we all following John?

23:17.980 --> 23:18.820
Let's head in.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.800
He seems really confident now.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.800
Are we following the guy who was rolling around earlier?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.080
Yeah, yeah.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.080
He actually does a little roll through the door.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.680
Donovan, he's not always like this.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.200
In fact, it's a little worrisome.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.920
I just am trying to keep the eye on the prize right now

23:34.920 --> 23:37.120
and figure that out later, I guess.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.700
Yeah, seems smart.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.960
As you guys walk in, the lights are off.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.720
However, there is a path of colorful string lights

23:47.720 --> 23:52.020
on the ground, like a pathway or a road.

23:52.020 --> 23:56.460
You notice that there is a little sitting area to your left

23:56.460 --> 23:58.780
where there are some tables and chairs set up.

23:58.780 --> 24:03.300
And sitting in one of the chairs is a corpse

24:03.300 --> 24:06.220
that is quite fermented.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.980
It has been here for some time, you would guess,

24:08.980 --> 24:09.820
by the looks of it.

24:09.820 --> 24:14.820
And right next to that corpse is a very alive person

24:15.200 --> 24:17.680
dancing their ass off.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.840
Just fucking getting it.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.480
I've seen pictures of Amelia, is this her?

24:22.480 --> 24:23.320
Nope.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.240
Hey, where's the ball?

24:24.240 --> 24:28.040
The dancing fiend continues their grind

24:28.040 --> 24:32.060
and with their hips motions in the way that you're headed.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.280
Thank you, thank you very much.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.240
I go that way.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.680
I'll continue on too, yeah.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.080
That's not Tim Fate with.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.900
I dance with him for a little while.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.060
It's just like a few bars,

24:48.060 --> 24:51.140
like I am grooving to the beat and then I walk on.

24:51.140 --> 24:52.060
Easy peasy.

24:52.060 --> 24:54.220
You would notice that the student union is-

24:54.220 --> 24:55.640
They have no idea.

24:55.640 --> 24:59.180
The path of colorful lights and thumping holiday base

24:59.180 --> 25:00.900
leads the five of you,

25:00.900 --> 25:04.220
four imposters in city PD uniforms

25:04.220 --> 25:07.240
and a nicely dressed fifth year college student

25:07.240 --> 25:09.220
to a three story atrium,

25:09.220 --> 25:11.580
kind of like a small square shopping mall.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.560
But instead of Forever 21 and Orange Julius,

25:14.560 --> 25:17.400
there's a CSU merch shop and a subway.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.600
You're on the middle level,

25:18.600 --> 25:21.720
so looking down you see the basement of this atrium

25:21.720 --> 25:24.840
and it's decked out in jingle ball decorations.

25:24.840 --> 25:28.160
But in drastic contrast to this festive cheer,

25:28.160 --> 25:32.240
you are surrounded only by pure chaos,

25:32.240 --> 25:36.600
personified by obsessive college students and faculty.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.920
Across the atrium on your level,

25:38.980 --> 25:43.100
there's a girl shaving the fur off a team of reindeer

25:43.100 --> 25:44.900
in front of a photo backdrop

25:44.900 --> 25:49.820
and she is shaking and gluing the loose fur to her own skin.

25:49.820 --> 25:50.940
On the bottom level,

25:50.940 --> 25:55.180
a pair of very tall and muscular men in Santa outfits

25:55.180 --> 25:58.060
are diligently wrapping a college student

25:58.060 --> 25:59.740
in gift wrapping paper.

25:59.740 --> 26:02.740
They are using duct tape and force.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.700
An older woman in a bathrobe

26:04.700 --> 26:07.300
and one of those fur lined leather aviator hats

26:07.300 --> 26:10.640
that cover your ears is climbing a thick garland

26:10.640 --> 26:12.840
from this level up to the top.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.040
The garland wraps around these columns

26:15.040 --> 26:17.360
that encircle the opening to the atrium

26:17.360 --> 26:19.400
every 10 yards or so

26:19.400 --> 26:21.880
and they all meet in the center of the dome

26:21.880 --> 26:26.640
atop this part of the Accord Student Union here at CSU.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.640
Hanging from the middle of this dome

26:28.640 --> 26:33.400
is a massive disco ball, 10 yards in diameter,

26:33.400 --> 26:36.360
wearing an equally huge Santa hat.

26:36.380 --> 26:37.700
That's college, baby.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.180
That's college.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.220
Three people in elf costumes

26:41.220 --> 26:43.320
are in the corner of the lower level

26:43.320 --> 26:45.020
in a little ice skating rink

26:45.020 --> 26:48.300
with a life-size Frosty the Snowman figure.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.920
They keep putting the carrot in different places

26:50.920 --> 26:53.420
while laughing hysterically.

26:53.420 --> 26:57.380
A naked man is using a mop and a mop bucket full of paint

26:57.380 --> 26:59.300
to write out a sequence of numbers

26:59.300 --> 27:01.980
at the bottom of the stairs to the lower level.

27:01.980 --> 27:04.540
Across the room on the bottom floor,

27:04.540 --> 27:08.480
there is a young woman throwing a laptop in the air

27:08.480 --> 27:11.840
and trying to spin around in a circle before catching it.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.000
She is doing this fervently

27:14.000 --> 27:16.160
and she's wearing a shirt that says,

27:16.160 --> 27:21.160
gifts house on the back and best RA ever on the front.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.840
It says, if I make it this far,

27:23.840 --> 27:28.120
a dude doing squats on top of Santa Claus's throne stops

27:28.120 --> 27:30.680
and begins violently chanting,

27:30.680 --> 27:35.680
Towel alico, towel alico, towel alico, towel alico.

27:38.780 --> 27:40.080
That's college, baby.

27:41.620 --> 27:45.140
I look at the man who's chanting and I just,

27:45.140 --> 27:46.780
I just boom out.

27:46.780 --> 27:49.040
I command you to stop.

27:49.040 --> 27:49.880
Roll.

27:49.880 --> 27:53.020
And I wave my hand, I just gotta wave a hand at him.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.120
Roll persuade for me.

27:55.660 --> 28:00.620
Got a 76 on a, probably not higher than that.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.280
We're sitting in new places

28:02.280 --> 28:03.600
and it's hard for me to see my character sheet.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.100
No, that's a fail.

28:05.100 --> 28:10.100
Towel alico, towel alico, towel alico.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.680
And when he keeps going,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.240
I kind of look at my hand in confusion.

28:13.240 --> 28:16.280
John, who were you talking to, was that man?

28:16.280 --> 28:17.640
Oh, you were, gotcha.

28:17.640 --> 28:19.880
I look at Clark, I get my gun out

28:19.880 --> 28:22.000
and I like look at him and point it at the guy

28:22.000 --> 28:24.160
and like questioning the look in my eyes.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.260
John's just nodding.

28:26.760 --> 28:27.840
He must be punished.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.780
Towel alico, whatever, what's that?

28:30.780 --> 28:32.860
I've heard it before, but I,

28:32.860 --> 28:34.420
It sounds like a spell, right?

28:34.420 --> 28:36.540
That's what I'm thinking and I think we need to stop it.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.420
Do we remember what it is?

28:38.420 --> 28:39.900
So far, I don't know.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.460
It could have done a number of things.

28:41.460 --> 28:44.020
Listen, it's been a while since we played, but that is,

28:44.020 --> 28:44.860
We've heard it a lot.

28:44.860 --> 28:45.680
We've heard it a lot, right?

28:45.680 --> 28:46.520
I just don't remember what it does.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.840
I don't think it's done anything yet.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.540
Isn't it just the phrase?

28:49.540 --> 28:51.780
I punched your brother's partner

28:51.780 --> 28:53.000
when you started saying it.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.660
Yeah, so we've stopped everybody.

28:54.660 --> 28:55.500
It's done it so far.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.060
Yeah, maybe we have stopped it every time.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.440
Yeah, so I'm like looking at,

28:59.440 --> 29:02.320
Keith is looking at Clark ready to shoot this guy just,

29:02.320 --> 29:05.280
I don't know why I'm asking for permission this time, but.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.560
Clark shrugs.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.400
I fire.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.840
Roll firearms.

29:13.640 --> 29:14.680
That's a two.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.320
So anyway, I started blasting.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.640
Holy shit, all right, cool, so.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.160
Hey, maybe we should make a role-playing decision

29:25.180 --> 29:26.940
that's not shooting up a college.

29:30.140 --> 29:30.980
Fucking food court.

29:30.980 --> 29:31.820
They're monsters.

29:31.820 --> 29:34.880
Too late, so roll damage for me.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.180
A nine.

29:37.180 --> 29:38.000
Oh my God.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.340
Where do you shoot him?

29:41.340 --> 29:42.340
Right in chest.

29:42.340 --> 29:43.180
Yep.

29:44.440 --> 29:48.060
As two shots hit this man, center mass,

29:48.060 --> 29:52.300
he falls back into the throne of one Santa Claus

29:52.320 --> 29:56.080
and begins bleeding as he continues to slowly,

29:56.080 --> 29:57.740
quietly chant,

30:05.240 --> 30:08.540
Oh, and he succeeds on a constitution check

30:08.540 --> 30:10.320
and stays conscious,

30:10.320 --> 30:13.040
but fewer can hear his chant.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.080
Does the crowd react at all?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.080
Yes, absolutely.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.400
The crowd a hundred percent reacts, so.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.920
Yay, I'm the star of the show now.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.260
Everybody look at me.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.100
Spotlight online.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.020
I'm the DJ now.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.980
As soon as you fire the gun,

30:27.980 --> 30:32.760
everyone in this room turns and looks at the five of you.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.300
Everyone then looks at the Santa throne

30:36.300 --> 30:40.500
where this man is bleeding all over while still chanting.

30:40.500 --> 30:45.300
Reindeer fur girl immediately turns and begins sharpening

30:45.300 --> 30:49.140
one of the horns on one of these live reindeer.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.220
The Santa twins.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.840
Wait, these are live reindeer?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.160
Oh yeah, baby.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.000
Oh shit.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Was not aware of that.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.440
Yeah, I definitely thought he just

30:56.440 --> 30:57.840
more fucked up reindeer.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.200
Were they letting her shave them willingly

31:00.200 --> 31:01.200
or were they struggling again?

31:01.200 --> 31:03.360
She was cutting off their fur.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.560
They're tied up for a photo shoot

31:05.560 --> 31:09.080
and she's cutting off their fur with a blunt knife

31:09.080 --> 31:10.320
that she carries with her.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.520
Holy shit.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.360
Should have shot her first.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.640
Yeah, that's not cool.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.880
So she begins sharpening one of these reindeer's horns.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.540
The Santa twins, the two giant muscular men

31:21.540 --> 31:24.500
dressed as Santa Claus, start wrapping each other

31:24.500 --> 31:27.780
as opposed to this undergrad that they were wrapping before

31:27.780 --> 31:30.700
and they're using duct tape to wrap around

31:30.700 --> 31:32.580
the gift wrapping on each other.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.660
I wanted to ask about that guy who's being wrapped.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.680
Does he seem under the same spell as everyone

31:36.680 --> 31:38.420
or was he maybe fighting against them?

31:38.420 --> 31:42.900
He was compulsively staying as still as possible.

31:42.900 --> 31:43.740
Gotcha.

31:43.740 --> 31:46.960
Cousin Eddie Lady Climber starts climbing faster

31:46.980 --> 31:51.100
and faster up this garland and is trying desperately

31:51.100 --> 31:53.300
to end like to the point to where she's like

31:53.300 --> 31:56.500
losing grip on the garland and still making it up.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.060
She's in very good shape.

31:58.060 --> 32:00.940
The three elves in the corner, they begin sitting

32:00.940 --> 32:04.820
on the ground and unlacing their ice skates.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.220
The naked mop man begins squeezing paint back

32:09.220 --> 32:13.540
into his mop bucket and the girl throwing the laptop

32:13.540 --> 32:16.200
in the air begins throwing it way higher

32:16.200 --> 32:18.520
than she was before, so much higher.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.760
Like she's throwing this laptop 20 feet in the air

32:21.760 --> 32:25.680
every time and still catching it currently.

32:25.680 --> 32:26.500
Luke, you had a question?

32:26.500 --> 32:29.360
So there's the basement level, the middle level

32:29.360 --> 32:31.040
that we're on and then an upper level?

32:31.040 --> 32:31.880
Yes.

32:31.880 --> 32:32.920
Okay, who's on the basement level?

32:32.920 --> 32:36.560
The basement level is the man who is in the throne

32:36.560 --> 32:40.040
of Santa Claus who is chanting and bleeding out currently.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.880
The Santa twins are on the basement level as well

32:42.900 --> 32:44.640
who are wrapping each other with gift wrapping

32:44.640 --> 32:45.980
and duct tape.

32:45.980 --> 32:50.040
The three elves in the ice skating rink are also

32:50.040 --> 32:53.540
in the basement level as is the naked mop man

32:53.540 --> 32:57.540
who is squeezing paint back into his mop bucket

32:57.540 --> 32:58.980
as is the laptop girl.

32:58.980 --> 33:00.780
Luke, ask him your real question.

33:00.780 --> 33:02.260
What have we talked about?

33:02.260 --> 33:03.100
Ask him what it's like to have sex.

33:03.100 --> 33:03.940
You can ask me anything Luke.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.080
Ask him what it's like to have sex.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.660
That's for later, that's not on the packet.

33:07.660 --> 33:08.740
I wanna know.

33:08.740 --> 33:10.900
Who's on the level we're on?

33:10.900 --> 33:11.900
I want you to show me.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.080
Make him tell us.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.280
On your level.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.840
Who's on our level?

33:18.840 --> 33:19.700
Thomas.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.320
On your level is the reindeer fur girl

33:25.320 --> 33:28.920
and then on the next level climbing up to the next level

33:28.920 --> 33:30.600
is the cousin lady climber.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.040
Gotcha, thank you.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.400
I wanna draw my pistol if I can.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.040
Yeah, we're in free play right now

33:36.040 --> 33:37.960
so you can do whatever you want.

33:37.960 --> 33:38.800
Yeah, I don't know.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.640
Are we starting combat?

33:39.640 --> 33:40.460
No, we are, yeah.

33:40.460 --> 33:41.300
Okay, cool.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.600
I draw my pistol and point it at the reindeer girl

33:43.600 --> 33:46.800
and I say, touch not mine creatures

33:46.800 --> 33:49.920
and then I look at my gun and I'm like,

33:49.920 --> 33:52.120
I must use these mortal instruments

33:52.120 --> 33:55.000
to achieve my divine means.

33:55.000 --> 33:55.840
Fire, I aim in fire.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.480
Okay, so she is across the atrium from you

33:58.480 --> 34:00.000
so as you say that.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.240
I got a 65.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.620
You're just assuming that as you speak

34:03.620 --> 34:05.080
that she'll be able to hear you

34:05.080 --> 34:07.880
regardless of the volume of your voice.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.760
I'm assuming.

34:08.760 --> 34:09.600
Who are you talking to now, John?

34:10.060 --> 34:11.660
Putting it out into the universe,

34:12.940 --> 34:13.860
which is me.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.100
Roll firearms for me.

34:15.100 --> 34:17.100
I am the universe experience in itself.

34:18.220 --> 34:19.940
43 on a 60.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.840
All right, roll a D10 for damage.

34:23.060 --> 34:23.900
Seven.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.500
She gets hit once in the shoulder,

34:25.500 --> 34:27.360
immediately falls to the ground

34:27.360 --> 34:28.900
and the bullet goes through

34:28.900 --> 34:30.340
and one of the reindeer's

34:30.340 --> 34:33.580
and then falls over as well

34:33.580 --> 34:36.500
and she is on the ground bleeding

34:37.320 --> 34:42.320
as she tries to grab on to the hairless reindeer

34:42.440 --> 34:44.820
in front of her to help herself up.

34:44.820 --> 34:48.000
She goes limp and her head just like hits the ground.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.200
Can I have Mercy kill that reindeer real quick?

34:52.280 --> 34:55.720
The look on Zach's face just now is, huh.

34:55.720 --> 34:56.560
I just threw up.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.600
You're the one who made me shoot a fucking reindeer.

34:59.600 --> 35:03.240
I just want to resolve that as quickly as possible.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.880
I'm just telling the story, man.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.840
This is just what happened.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.040
It's not my fault.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.160
It's not your fault.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.040
Life is chaos.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.540
Dude, you can't change the past.

35:20.120 --> 35:20.960
Go for it.

35:22.120 --> 35:22.960
97.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.780
God damn it.

35:23.780 --> 35:24.880
I shoot another reindeer.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.760
That's going to be a fucked up photo shoot.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.160
Well, she fucked it up by shaving him already.

35:36.980 --> 35:37.820
Sorry about that.

35:37.820 --> 35:38.660
Did you just shake your-

35:41.180 --> 35:43.700
He just grabbed his McDonald's cup and shook it.

35:44.540 --> 35:45.380
That was habit.

35:46.500 --> 35:47.340
Oh boy.

35:47.340 --> 35:48.160
Okay.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.000
Love that.

35:52.340 --> 35:54.060
How many drankies are left in here?

35:58.940 --> 36:00.140
We're better than this.

36:02.180 --> 36:04.080
Maybe, I don't know.

36:04.900 --> 36:05.740
I am.

36:05.740 --> 36:06.580
You're not.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.500
I hope that's your character talking.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.340
Hey Donovan.

36:13.340 --> 36:14.160
Hey.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.300
Hey, what are you thinking, man?

36:15.300 --> 36:16.580
Mildly panicked.

36:16.580 --> 36:17.400
Uh-huh.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.840
Do you want to go ahead and roll sanity for me?

36:19.840 --> 36:20.680
Yeah.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.360
I don't know what to roll it against.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.020
You'll roll against a,

36:24.020 --> 36:26.100
I think based on the week that you've had,

36:26.100 --> 36:29.400
you're going to roll it against a pretty solid 58.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.240
Sounds right.

36:30.380 --> 36:34.220
54.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.060
Very well done.

36:37.060 --> 36:37.900
Okay.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.460
You can hold yourself together for the time being,

36:39.460 --> 36:41.480
but just so you know,

36:41.480 --> 36:43.380
this is the first time that Donovan,

36:43.380 --> 36:46.260
I'm assuming has seen anyone get shot

36:46.260 --> 36:47.980
or maybe even any animal.

36:47.980 --> 36:48.800
Yes.

36:48.800 --> 36:49.640
Oh, for sure.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.860
You've never seen a reindeer get blasted in the face.

36:52.860 --> 36:53.700
Raw vegan?

36:53.700 --> 36:54.520
Yeah.

36:54.520 --> 36:55.740
Only sprouts for this boy.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.140
You know what?

36:58.140 --> 36:58.960
That's really cool.

36:58.960 --> 36:59.800
I really respect that.

36:59.800 --> 37:00.640
Thank you.

37:03.180 --> 37:04.020
Anyway.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.140
I think Donovan, after the first gunshot,

37:08.140 --> 37:09.220
it's like, what the fuck?

37:09.220 --> 37:10.420
And like freaking out.

37:10.420 --> 37:13.020
Cause it's the first time a gun has been fired

37:13.020 --> 37:15.460
probably in his vicinity ever.

37:15.460 --> 37:16.300
Yeah.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.120
And it is quite frightening.

37:17.120 --> 37:20.780
I would imagine to a fifth year college student.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.620
It's yeah.

37:21.620 --> 37:23.900
It's the first time he's seen a gun since high school.

37:23.900 --> 37:24.720
Yeah.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.060
Or violence.

37:26.060 --> 37:26.980
Wow.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.040
So America has an epidemic of gun violence.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.120
So as the second gunshot rings out,

37:33.120 --> 37:37.200
everyone begins to panic and obsess a little bit harder.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.780
If Clark wanted to get to the girl

37:39.780 --> 37:42.680
who was throwing the laptop, how would he do that?

37:42.680 --> 37:43.520
He wants to do that.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.340
Okay.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.840
So you would have to go down the stairs

37:45.840 --> 37:47.280
into the basement of the atrium

37:47.280 --> 37:52.280
and then past the Santa twins and the naked mop man

37:53.280 --> 37:54.940
before you got to the laptop girl.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.800
I'm going to yell at the guys, cover me.

37:57.620 --> 37:58.460
And I'm going down the stairs.

37:58.460 --> 37:59.380
So you take off running.

37:59.380 --> 38:02.060
If they successfully cover you,

38:02.060 --> 38:03.980
then you'll make it there no problem.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.980
Well, I mean, I have my own wherewithal.

38:05.980 --> 38:07.820
If something, if something wants to stop me,

38:07.820 --> 38:09.560
I get to, I get to fight back,

38:09.560 --> 38:10.580
but I'm hoping that they'll.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.700
Leon is going to be like, I'm with you.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.660
And is joining you.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.460
I hear him yell to cover him.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.540
And the first person between him

38:18.540 --> 38:20.620
and the top girl is the twins.

38:20.620 --> 38:21.460
Yes.

38:21.460 --> 38:23.100
I'm going to run behind with him.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.660
But right before I start going down the stairs,

38:25.680 --> 38:27.400
take a shot at the one on the left.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.240
All right.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.060
Roll firearms.

38:30.960 --> 38:31.800
That's a one.

38:35.800 --> 38:36.640
Okay.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.480
I say.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.480
Celebratory shake.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.920
We've got our own manual drops.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.760
As I do it, I hear Clark say, cover me.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.240
And I'm like, hell yeah, Clark.

38:50.240 --> 38:54.360
And then I look directly into the eyes of that twin.

38:54.380 --> 38:56.860
And I say, I'm the bill of the ball.

38:56.860 --> 38:57.860
Ding, ding.

38:57.860 --> 39:00.300
And then pull the gun and shoot him

39:00.300 --> 39:01.500
right between the eyeballs.

39:01.500 --> 39:02.340
Yeah.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.160
And Santa dies.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.540
You're the new Santa Claus.

39:05.380 --> 39:06.220
Look at me.

39:06.220 --> 39:07.040
I'm the Santa now.

39:09.620 --> 39:13.380
The other Santa does not miss a beat.

39:13.380 --> 39:17.620
Grabs the duct tape out of the hand of his fellow Santa

39:17.620 --> 39:20.500
as the man just drops to the ground.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.500
The duct tape being the only thing left.

39:22.520 --> 39:27.120
And he just smoothly continues wrapping himself

39:27.120 --> 39:28.040
in this duct tape.

39:28.040 --> 39:28.860
I would look at Clark.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.320
I'm like, they may, they seem like they may not be

39:31.320 --> 39:32.160
our biggest obstacles.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.360
Yeah, they're gonna take care of themselves here, so.

39:35.480 --> 39:36.880
And I follow suit.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.800
Clark is running at the laptop girl.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.640
Yeah.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.360
The Santa guys are taking care of themselves.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.100
No one's fucking with any more reindeer.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.040
Are there any threats we see around us?

39:45.040 --> 39:48.000
You've got old lady maybe potentially climbing your way

39:48.000 --> 39:48.840
or was she above us already?

39:48.840 --> 39:50.040
Climbing to the second floor.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.320
Climbing from the second to the third floor.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.820
And we're on the second floor?

39:53.820 --> 39:54.640
Yeah.

39:54.640 --> 39:55.480
Can I reach her?

39:55.480 --> 39:56.700
Like if I reached over the edge, could I like grab her?

39:56.700 --> 39:58.860
You'd have to like run around the side

39:58.860 --> 40:01.080
and then probably get on the garland yourself

40:01.080 --> 40:02.740
and begin climbing before you got to her.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.700
Cause she, when those first gunshots rang out,

40:05.700 --> 40:08.040
she really started going for it.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.340
She's free soloing this bitch like a moat.

40:10.340 --> 40:11.380
I just watched that.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.540
It was so fucking good.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.700
I mean, I know everybody said it and that's old news, but.

40:14.700 --> 40:15.740
My hands are sweaty.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.060
Unrelated.

40:18.060 --> 40:19.780
Yeah, I want to shoot the old broad.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.660
Jesus Christ.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.560
I'm kidding.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.760
I'm going to cover, I'm going to cover Joe.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.960
Clark, I want to see.

40:26.960 --> 40:27.800
Oh yeah.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.920
Can you ready an action in Delta Green?

40:28.920 --> 40:30.400
You can ready an action in Delta Green.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.160
So I'm going to be on Overwatch for Clark.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.000
Dope.

40:33.000 --> 40:33.820
Sounds good, Justin.

40:33.820 --> 40:34.660
What's Donovan doing?

40:34.660 --> 40:36.360
He pulls out his grenade launcher.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.440
Is there like a weapon nearby that like,

40:40.440 --> 40:42.720
like even like a bat or a plant,

40:42.720 --> 40:44.000
it's like some kind of thing I could use

40:44.000 --> 40:46.660
as a makeshift weapon just to like arm myself.

40:46.660 --> 40:49.560
Actually, as you're looking around for a makeshift weapon.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.000
You see a bat flying around

40:51.380 --> 40:52.220
and you just grab it out of the air

40:52.220 --> 40:53.860
and chuck it at one of the Santas.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.480
You become Batman.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.320
Bad man?

40:56.320 --> 40:57.140
Bad man.

40:57.140 --> 40:57.980
So as.

40:57.980 --> 40:58.820
Badminton?

40:58.820 --> 40:59.660
Badminton.

40:59.660 --> 41:02.500
So as you're shuttle cocking your way,

41:02.500 --> 41:05.100
Leon Simpson, halfway down the stairs,

41:05.100 --> 41:08.260
turns and goes, shit, Clark, I forgot.

41:08.260 --> 41:10.820
And runs right back up the stairs

41:10.820 --> 41:13.340
and throws a gun to Donovan

41:13.340 --> 41:15.460
and then grabs you by the shoulder

41:15.460 --> 41:18.040
and takes you like around a corner

41:18.100 --> 41:19.540
where you both can watch,

41:19.540 --> 41:22.300
but you're a little bit safer away from everything.

41:22.300 --> 41:23.700
Sounds like a good plan.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.420
I mean, you can get out there if you want,

41:25.420 --> 41:26.980
but I would rather you didn't

41:26.980 --> 41:29.940
based on the fact that as of now our current theory

41:29.940 --> 41:31.140
is that you're our savior.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.300
Oh, that's like a lot to put on me, but I, sure.

41:34.300 --> 41:36.080
You're gonna do great things in this world

41:36.080 --> 41:37.420
and if you don't, it's on you.

41:37.420 --> 41:39.100
He just like gets really sad

41:39.100 --> 41:40.500
and looks down at the ground.

41:42.180 --> 41:43.460
Okay.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.420
Okay, so you understand

41:44.420 --> 41:45.980
that you should probably not die today?

41:46.520 --> 41:49.520
That was my, that was kind of my plan was not to be dead.

41:49.520 --> 41:50.560
I think we're good to go.

41:50.560 --> 41:51.400
Thanks.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.220
So.

41:52.220 --> 41:53.460
Wait, wait, wait, how do I use this?

41:53.460 --> 41:55.720
Oh, right, and then he shows you how to use it,

41:55.720 --> 41:57.560
but like very quickly.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.160
Yeah, I'll definitely remember, I'm smart.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.000
Roll a 50-50 shot on whether or not

42:03.000 --> 42:04.800
you know how to use this gun at all.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.280
Do I like flip a coin?

42:06.280 --> 42:08.600
Just roll, if you roll under 50,

42:08.600 --> 42:10.040
you know how to do it, yeah.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.240
Under 50.

42:13.300 --> 42:16.020
With that, we'll give you a 30% in firearms.

42:16.020 --> 42:17.020
Ooh.

42:17.020 --> 42:17.860
Nice.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.180
It feels natural.

42:21.100 --> 42:24.220
Why have I not been using this all this time?

42:24.220 --> 42:26.100
Your new friends certainly like doing it.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.760
So, the Santa twin that's left,

42:28.760 --> 42:30.900
the lady climbing up the garland,

42:30.900 --> 42:33.500
all three elves, the naked mop man,

42:33.500 --> 42:36.140
and the girl throwing the laptop in the air,

42:36.140 --> 42:38.780
all stop what they're doing

42:41.060 --> 42:42.380
and begin chanting.

42:42.380 --> 42:44.240
Tall, we allow the call.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.120
Tall, we allow the call.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.000
Tall, we allow the call.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.720
Tall, we allow the call.

42:49.720 --> 42:54.120
The man in the throne of the Santa Claus dressing

42:54.120 --> 42:57.080
runs and jumps onto,

42:57.080 --> 42:59.760
so there's like a four poster chair

42:59.760 --> 43:02.040
for the elf that sits next to him,

43:02.040 --> 43:06.520
and he jumps on it with his neck landing directly on,

43:06.520 --> 43:08.760
what are those called at the top of like a four poster?

43:08.760 --> 43:09.960
Like a spinet?

43:09.960 --> 43:11.000
We'll call it a spinet.

43:11.020 --> 43:12.020
And if that's not a word,

43:12.020 --> 43:13.700
that's what it means now.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.140
Post?

43:15.140 --> 43:16.380
At the top of a post.

43:16.380 --> 43:20.820
What do you call that thing?

43:20.820 --> 43:22.140
An uppy pointy,

43:23.340 --> 43:26.340
just a straight up and downer.

43:26.340 --> 43:28.180
So he jumps on the chair stalagmite.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.180
It's like a line, but round.

43:32.060 --> 43:34.140
And punctures his own throat

43:34.140 --> 43:36.340
and immediately just like,

43:36.340 --> 43:37.860
and begins bleeding.

43:37.860 --> 43:39.380
Did it look purposeful or accidental?

43:39.400 --> 43:42.040
It looked extremely purposeful

43:42.040 --> 43:45.760
and the chants get louder from everyone else.

43:45.760 --> 43:46.800
Clark, it's your turn.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.400
The laptop is in the air and you have made your way there.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.280
What do you want to do?

43:51.280 --> 43:52.480
I've made my time to her.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.900
Yep, she is chanting and no longer,

43:56.480 --> 43:59.280
and no longer paying attention to the laptop

43:59.280 --> 44:01.560
that is in the air about 20 feet in the air.

44:01.560 --> 44:02.680
I don't know how many actions this is,

44:02.680 --> 44:04.120
but I'd like to catch the laptop

44:04.120 --> 44:05.240
so it doesn't hit the ground,

44:05.240 --> 44:06.600
but knock her in the chin.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.900
Just see if it clocks her.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.320
Is that the way she's throwing it?

44:10.320 --> 44:11.160
I could do that, yeah.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.860
It'll land directly on her head if you do nothing.

44:14.860 --> 44:15.700
Oh, I'll do nothing then.

44:15.700 --> 44:18.600
Yeah, if it's coming down on her.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.560
Let's see what happens.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.560
I'll just see what happens there.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.160
I'll let that play out and then I'll see what I do.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.920
Oh my God.

44:28.920 --> 44:30.780
The laptop comes down in such a way

44:30.780 --> 44:35.240
that the most sturdy edge comes down directly on her temple

44:35.260 --> 44:36.560
because as she's chanting,

44:36.560 --> 44:39.600
she's turning her head to the side completely

44:39.600 --> 44:42.540
in this weird like you just said squirrel

44:42.540 --> 44:44.180
to a dog kind of way.

44:44.180 --> 44:48.300
It hits her directly above the ear in the side of the head

44:48.300 --> 44:50.860
and she goes blank, roll luck for me.

44:52.260 --> 44:55.380
I'm using new dice that my mom got me for Christmas.

44:55.380 --> 44:57.020
Ooh, mama dice.

44:57.020 --> 44:59.160
They're good, 54 on a 65.

44:59.160 --> 45:00.000
Nice.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.340
That will come into play later.

45:01.340 --> 45:03.100
Okay, so did it knock her out?

45:03.100 --> 45:04.220
It knocked her out cold.

45:04.240 --> 45:06.600
Okay, I want to grab the laptop and her

45:06.600 --> 45:08.980
and run retreat back to the second floor.

45:08.980 --> 45:11.840
Okay, so you can get a hold of them this round,

45:11.840 --> 45:13.520
but you won't be able to make it all the way back.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.000
You can start your way there.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.840
What is Keith Vigna doing?

45:16.840 --> 45:20.560
He sees that happen and looks at the people chanting.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.640
Are they looking at us or just kind of out of it?

45:23.640 --> 45:26.760
They are all staring at one of you.

45:26.760 --> 45:29.200
I look at one of the elves and he's staring right at me.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.040
Oh yeah.

45:30.040 --> 45:30.860
I see down.

45:30.860 --> 45:34.040
And he's taken off his ice skating skate.

45:34.860 --> 45:37.380
Yeah, I see down about two feet away from me

45:37.380 --> 45:39.860
is a candy cane, but the end is sharpened

45:39.860 --> 45:41.580
like you're supposed to stick it in your lawn.

45:41.580 --> 45:42.420
100%.

45:42.420 --> 45:44.820
And I grab it and I spear it right at him.

45:45.980 --> 45:46.820
Roll.

45:46.820 --> 45:47.660
Roll spear.

45:48.660 --> 45:49.820
Roll athletics for me.

45:52.660 --> 45:53.540
83 on a 50.

45:53.540 --> 45:57.780
You run down the stairs with this sharpened candy cane

45:57.780 --> 46:00.720
and you launch it at your elven foe.

46:04.860 --> 46:08.140
And it just skies and it lands directly

46:08.140 --> 46:10.460
in the head of Frosty the snowman.

46:10.460 --> 46:11.300
Do they laugh?

46:11.300 --> 46:12.120
And it gets stuck there.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.560
So there's a candy cane coming out

46:13.560 --> 46:16.060
in between the two button eyes.

46:16.060 --> 46:16.900
What are the eyes?

46:16.900 --> 46:17.720
Coal.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.460
And it goes right into the button nose

46:19.460 --> 46:22.420
and the elves die laughing

46:22.420 --> 46:24.820
and they're giggling their asses off as they're

46:24.820 --> 46:29.660
Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool,

46:29.660 --> 46:33.620
Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool, wow!

46:34.200 --> 46:35.520
Now Zach, are these really Santa's elves

46:35.520 --> 46:38.340
or are they just people pretending to be Santa's elves?

46:38.340 --> 46:39.180
You don't know.

46:40.840 --> 46:41.720
Roll a cult.

46:44.780 --> 46:46.020
38 on a 10.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.160
Those ears look real, baby.

46:51.160 --> 46:52.520
Give one a tug if I can.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.900
You can give one a tug if you want

46:53.900 --> 46:56.060
cause it's your turn, John Lee Pettymore.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.360
What's the naked guy doing?

46:57.360 --> 46:58.880
He has put the mop down

46:58.880 --> 47:03.280
and he is putting the mop bucket up against the wall

47:03.820 --> 47:07.180
and he's beginning to dip his head into the paint

47:07.180 --> 47:08.620
that's in this mop bucket.

47:08.620 --> 47:09.680
Like you do.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.860
Does it bubble up?

47:10.860 --> 47:11.700
It's creepy.

47:11.700 --> 47:12.520
As he's chanting.

47:12.520 --> 47:13.360
He hasn't gotten in there yet.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.600
He's still chanting.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.600
Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.

47:17.600 --> 47:20.340
Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.

47:20.340 --> 47:21.400
Well done.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.240
Yeah.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.060
Thank you.

47:23.060 --> 47:24.900
You brought out that big bucket of paint and everything.

47:24.900 --> 47:25.740
Yes.

47:27.180 --> 47:28.020
And we'll be right back.

47:28.020 --> 47:29.500
Yeah, Zach's gonna have to clean off

47:29.500 --> 47:30.740
for the next 30 minutes.

47:32.060 --> 47:33.100
Just throw some dirt on me.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.760
He's in the basement?

47:34.760 --> 47:35.600
He is in the basement.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.420
Like the lower level?

47:36.420 --> 47:37.260
Yes.

47:37.260 --> 47:38.100
Okay.

47:38.100 --> 47:38.920
So John jumps off the balcony.

47:38.920 --> 47:39.760
Yeah.

47:39.760 --> 47:40.600
On to him.

47:40.600 --> 47:41.420
Awesome.

47:41.420 --> 47:42.260
And from the way he jumps,

47:42.260 --> 47:43.100
it looks like he thinks he's like,

47:43.100 --> 47:44.580
he literally just kind of like steps off.

47:46.640 --> 47:47.480
All right.

47:47.480 --> 47:50.100
Roll dexterity or athletics, whichever one's higher.

47:52.040 --> 47:54.040
65 decks.

47:54.040 --> 47:54.880
Five.

47:54.880 --> 47:55.720
What do you do?

47:55.720 --> 47:57.580
It looks impossible.

47:57.580 --> 47:59.320
I don't know if you've ever seen being there.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.120
It's very Chauncey Gardner-ish.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.920
He literally just like steps off

48:03.740 --> 48:05.740
and then you just see his feet moving through the air

48:05.740 --> 48:07.100
like he's walking down steps,

48:07.100 --> 48:09.060
but very quickly because he's just falling.

48:09.060 --> 48:11.520
And then perfectly in his stride,

48:11.520 --> 48:12.840
as he steps the foot forward,

48:12.840 --> 48:15.860
it like hits, he steps on the naked man's head

48:15.860 --> 48:17.500
and it breaks his fall.

48:17.500 --> 48:18.740
And he just glides onto the,

48:18.740 --> 48:21.620
like walks onto the floor like he meant to do it.

48:21.620 --> 48:22.460
Hell yeah.

48:22.460 --> 48:25.740
Your foot comes down on this naked man

48:25.740 --> 48:29.500
and shoves his head into the bottom of the mop.

48:29.520 --> 48:33.760
You stand on the other side with literally no paint on you

48:33.760 --> 48:37.280
and turning back around, you just hear

48:37.280 --> 48:42.200
doodle doodle doodle, doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.000
Since he's literally a fish in the bucket,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.840
can I just put my gun up to his head and kill him?

48:48.200 --> 48:49.040
Next round.

48:50.960 --> 48:53.560
I just mean as a casual afterthought to this round.

48:55.500 --> 48:56.340
Donovan.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.160
Tell me more.

48:57.160 --> 48:58.280
What's been going on here?

48:58.300 --> 49:00.580
I don't know, everything started going really crazy,

49:00.580 --> 49:03.140
but you know, I just, I try to keep to myself

49:03.140 --> 49:05.860
and you know, I just wanna have a good time at school.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.740
So I just, you know, just kind of been ignoring all this.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.860
You've just been going about your normal business.

49:10.860 --> 49:12.980
I mean, have classes been in session at all?

49:12.980 --> 49:16.420
I don't go to classes.

49:16.420 --> 49:17.500
Is that why you're still here?

49:17.500 --> 49:19.780
I do a lot of online classes.

49:19.780 --> 49:20.620
Gotcha.

49:20.620 --> 49:22.060
But I do live on campus.

49:22.060 --> 49:22.900
Okay.

49:22.900 --> 49:23.720
For fun.

49:23.720 --> 49:24.560
That's kind of sad.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.060
But I don't really do much.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.560
You know, I always thought I was important,

49:28.560 --> 49:30.440
but maybe not this important.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.980
Yeah, you weren't.

49:31.980 --> 49:32.820
Oh.

49:32.820 --> 49:33.980
From what I can tell.

49:33.980 --> 49:34.820
Oh, God.

49:36.500 --> 49:38.040
Roll for sadness.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.240
I'm sad.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.520
Kind of unaffected, honestly.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.560
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.720
Donovan's a very like non-emotional human being.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.960
Well, let's see if this gets you.

49:49.960 --> 49:52.240
So at the end of this round.

49:52.240 --> 49:54.120
So wait, is Leon just hanging out with me right now?

49:54.120 --> 49:55.120
Like protecting me?

49:55.120 --> 49:55.960
Yeah.

49:56.740 --> 49:58.380
I'm good with being done talking

49:58.380 --> 50:01.340
if you just want to watch what's going on here.

50:01.340 --> 50:02.940
Should we shoot at some of these elves?

50:02.940 --> 50:04.660
Yeah, I mean, we can if we want.

50:04.660 --> 50:06.140
Or you could take some pot shots.

50:06.140 --> 50:08.060
Can you tell me how to aim?

50:08.060 --> 50:09.300
Like ghost style?

50:09.300 --> 50:11.380
Yeah, I'll show you how to aim.

50:11.380 --> 50:12.460
Oh, no.

50:12.460 --> 50:14.620
Go ahead and roll firearms with a plus 20

50:14.620 --> 50:19.380
as he puts his hands on over your hands.

50:19.380 --> 50:20.500
From behind.

50:20.500 --> 50:22.180
And ghosts your gun.

50:22.180 --> 50:25.780
And you just can feel him smell you.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.840
Oh.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.160
Stop plus 40.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.640
Crip fail.

50:37.640 --> 50:38.480
A 99.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.360
It's not a Crip, but it's.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.560
Oh, I thought it was a 66.

50:40.560 --> 50:41.920
Oh, it's a 96.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.280
Nevermind, just a regular fail.

50:44.280 --> 50:45.920
Well, if 69 is a Crip success,

50:45.920 --> 50:47.280
should 96 be a Crip fail?

50:50.920 --> 50:52.120
Not this time,

50:52.120 --> 50:54.400
but that would be an interesting house rule to add.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.240
Let's add it.

50:55.700 --> 50:56.540
96.

50:56.540 --> 50:58.380
Fuck, I know I'm gonna be the next person to roll one

50:58.380 --> 51:00.900
in like two months when I don't fucking remember

51:00.900 --> 51:01.740
this at all.

51:01.740 --> 51:03.140
Head to toe, back to back.

51:03.140 --> 51:05.820
So Leon steps to the side and is like,

51:05.820 --> 51:08.620
yeah, okay, that was pretty good, but more like this.

51:08.620 --> 51:11.080
And then he just, he actually looks at you.

51:11.080 --> 51:14.180
He makes direct eye contact with you while he fires,

51:14.180 --> 51:17.100
takes one of the elves out and then he turns back.

51:17.100 --> 51:20.120
No, he continues looking at you and he's like,

51:20.120 --> 51:20.960
did I get him?

51:21.740 --> 51:25.400
You're really scary.

51:27.060 --> 51:27.900
You're a scary guy.

51:27.900 --> 51:29.940
Yes, I am.

51:29.940 --> 51:33.180
But I am impressed and that almost never happens.

51:33.180 --> 51:34.020
I'll take it.

51:34.020 --> 51:39.020
So the Santa Claus that is left completely wraps his head

51:39.080 --> 51:42.900
up in duct tape and then falls to the ground.

51:42.900 --> 51:46.880
The lady climbing up jumps for the disco ball

51:46.880 --> 51:48.540
that's in the middle of the room.

51:49.540 --> 51:54.320
Misses and falls face first into,

51:54.320 --> 51:56.920
I'm gonna say, let's see, she lands.

51:56.920 --> 51:59.920
Oh yeah, her crumpled body lands directly

51:59.920 --> 52:02.320
on the Santa Claus's throne.

52:02.320 --> 52:06.300
It's like her head landed in the spot where the back

52:06.300 --> 52:07.880
of your butt is.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.960
So it like kind of goes into the seat,

52:10.960 --> 52:12.800
like where you lose change and stuff.

52:12.800 --> 52:15.280
And the rest of her body just like kind of splits

52:15.300 --> 52:19.720
and crumbles on the sides around either arm of the chair.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.900
The three elves, two of which are dead,

52:23.900 --> 52:25.180
the very, oh no, sorry.

52:25.180 --> 52:29.220
The two elves that are left take off their skates completely

52:29.220 --> 52:33.660
and slit their own throats with their ice skates.

52:33.660 --> 52:38.660
Blood sprays onto the ice as the elves continue laughing,

52:39.420 --> 52:44.420
each ha overpowered by the sound of the gurgling.

52:45.300 --> 52:50.300
And the man in the mop continues to,

52:56.260 --> 52:59.180
and Clark looking over at the girl throwing the laptop

52:59.180 --> 53:02.100
up in the air, you see her.

53:02.100 --> 53:04.180
She's in my arms unconscious.

53:04.180 --> 53:06.780
You feel her breathe out

53:10.480 --> 53:12.380
and then not breathe back in.

53:12.800 --> 53:16.120
Oh, who's around me right now?

53:16.120 --> 53:17.400
Bad guys, anybody?

53:17.400 --> 53:18.640
Everyone is dead.

53:18.640 --> 53:20.640
I don't think there's necessarily bad guys,

53:20.640 --> 53:23.040
but the people who cause mental harm.

53:23.040 --> 53:25.480
We shot them like they were.

53:25.480 --> 53:30.480
I'm the only one trying to pull over.

53:55.480 --> 54:00.480
Oh, how can you have enough drowning out all alone?

54:07.100 --> 54:11.100
There's nobody home, no one home, no one home.

54:19.320 --> 54:21.400
Fly to fly to the stream.
