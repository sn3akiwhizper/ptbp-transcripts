1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Happy Friday, babies!

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,300
It's December 6th in PTBP time,

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,460
but it's Friday time in yo' time.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,920
My producer wanted to let y'all know

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,220
that we are on a Friday release schedule now.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,220
I'm sure it's so they can get up

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,220
to all sorts of debauchery on the weekends

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,680
without having to worry about producing this fine program,

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,060
or something like that.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,320
I don't know, the producer never speaks to me anymore.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,300
They just kind of ominously glare at me

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,140
while emitting white noise frequencies to frighten me.

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,440
Last week was regrettable.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,100
I ate so much chowder

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,640
that I vomited continuously for a week straight.

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,560
I was empty, so very empty.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
My stomach became an endless void

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,280
devoid of all hope and sustenance.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
But y'all know what that means.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,080
Just more room for clam gravy.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,460
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Lady Betavir,

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,840
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,960
She writes,

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,420
"'Dear Wolf, as my favorite time-traveling pirate radio host,

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,340
"'I was hoping that you could settle a debate

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,640
"'I've been having with some of my friends.

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,800
"'Recently, we got into a highly theoretical

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,020
"'and not at all realistic discussion

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,440

"'to decline food offered to you on a visit,

33

"'olives, and warm baby vegetables.

36
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,200
"'My friend Ellery and I both agreed

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,300
"'that it was better not to eat anything

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,040
"'than to risk vomiting in front of your host,

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,160
"'but our friend Brew insisted

40
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,500
"'that it would be too rude to decline,

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,200
"'even if the olives seem to be looking at you

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,460
"'and the carrots have fingernails,

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,940

Ready to click record.

101
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,100
As you finish hammering out the tune to Jingle Bells

102
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,620
on this Casio keyboard, you hear the bell tower

103
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,820
in the center of campus ring out as well.

104
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,400
You see through the window of this dorm room,

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,080
the bell tower lights up in a congratulatory glow,

106
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,540
and snow begins to fall.

107
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,100
I think we need to go to there.

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,620
But that's just a weather thing.

109
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
That's just a John thing.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,160
I turn away from the camera and I kind of like

111
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,800
smile and wink to myself.

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,620
Another camera gets it and you totally Jim the camera.

113
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,820
It's all about making moments in my line of work.

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,240
So is the plan to go to the Jingle Ball or,

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,720
I mean, we can assume that if this Alicia Locke,

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,560
what was her name?

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
Amelia.

118
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,080
Amelia Clark is down there,

119
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,540
then we can only assume that she's got more information

120
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,040
at least that we can talk to her.

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,060
So I guess we need to.

122
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,840
Yeah, I think she's probably the first one to get there.

123
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,380
So let's finish these clues and go talk to her.

124
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,760
We'll head to the bell tower.

125
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,380
Should we take the stairs or the elevator?

126
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
Not the elevator, it sounds like.

127
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,340
Yeah, probably not.

128
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,060
I'll just walk to not embarrass you.

129
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,160
As opposed to what?

130
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,000
He says that and John like rapidly rolls on all fours,

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,060
like out of the room.

132
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,880
What?

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,780
Rolls?

134
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,720
Yeah, he gets down and like,

135
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,060
he gets down into a ball and he rolls out of the room.

136
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,400
And then he turns around and he like winks at Donovan.

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,760
And he's like, roll sanity, Donovan.

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
I look at Clark and I'm like,

139
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,480
I'm thinking that body fucked him up a little bit.

140
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,280
Yeah, no shit, Keith, what the fuck?

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,760
But yeah, let's take the stairs to avoid

142
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,700
maybe that happening to you.

143
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,840
And away we go.

144
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,980
Walking across the campus, you see that the-

145
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,620
Walking and rolling.

146
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,020
I'm so sorry.

147
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,380
I'm walking next to you.

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,100
I was rolling to demonstrate how much more quickly

149
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,620
I would get places using my preferred method

150
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,220
of transportation.

151
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Jesus Christ.

152
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,020
You guys are walking and not rolling,

153
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,420
rolling mentally maybe?

154
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,060
You guys are walking to the bell tower,

155
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,960
which is nearby on campus.

156
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,800
And you pass many a holiday accoutrement on your way there.

157
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
And the snow falling has made it a really delightful evening

158
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,680
even though it is quite quiet on this campus,

159
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,600
except for the distant noises of holiday cheer and screaming.

160
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,240
Other than that, it's quiet though.

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,520
Besides the cheer and the screaming.

162
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,080
Have you fellas noticed how much screaming

163
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,240
is happening around us?

164
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,280
No, not until just now.

165
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,700
When we were first entered that gifts hall,

166
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,820
that gifts house-

167
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,740
Is that a dinosaur?

168
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,400
Donovan walked into a room, flipped on the light,

169
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,880
and a real creepy little dude said,

170
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,540
turn off that light.

171
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,020
And we did and got the hell out of there.

172
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,860
What?

173
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,180
You didn't investigate it?

174
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,340
It scared us.

175
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,160
What?

176
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,700
We'll have to go back to that.

177
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,620
You remember that Donovan?

178
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah, I don't actually remember if it was a boy or a girl

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,420
so much as a shadowy entity.

180
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,940
And I just wasn't done with it.

181
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
I didn't really want to deal with that.

182
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
I just figured that all these screams

183
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,440
were coming from people in dark rooms and it scared us.

184
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,640
So we turned off the light real quick.

185
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Well, that would have been nice to know,

186
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,680
but we'll get back to that, I guess.

187
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,360
And I continue walking towards the bell tower.

188
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,220
You guys make your way to an old stone bell tower

189
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,040
with a large gated entrance that is built into the rock

190
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,980
and stone formation that is forming this quite small,

191
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,980
cylindrical, phallic shape that it reaches

192
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,100
into the night December sky.

193
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,760
And the door has a gate right there.

194
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,140
There's a gate on the door, there's a door on the gate.

195
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,540
It's just a gate, it's not a door, and it's open.

196
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,420
I walk on in.

197
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,260
I follow.

198
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
So this is a dark stairwell.

199
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,380
It is open all the way up like a silo in the middle,

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,600
but there are these stone stairs that go in a spiral upward

201
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,040
to the very top.

202
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,880
Thomas is just drawing circles in his notes.

203
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,500
It's really horrifying.

204
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,000
Who's first?

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Who's going first?

206
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,660
Keith Vigna's going first.

207
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm going to go first.

208
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,120
And Keith Vigna, you about halfway up,

209
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,180
you see that there is a corpse on the stairwell.

210
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,960
I look back, I'm like, close your eyes, guys.

211
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,300
You're not going to want to see this.

212
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,240
Close our eyes?

213
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,940
Just trust me.

214
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,780
Looking past Keith Vigna.

215
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,500
Technically, I don't have eyes, but I'll humor you.

216
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,980
At this point, Keith is kind of like worried about Jon,

217
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,520
but also like, okay, whatever.

218
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,340
The world worries for me and I worry for the world

219
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,060
and neither of us can do a thing to help the other.

220
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,500
The corpse is wearing a security guard uniform.

221
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,280
And it's dead.

222
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,580
Guys, just close your eyes and keep going up the stairs.

223
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,720
And I stand by the corpse to kind of guide them past it.

224
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,200
I want to stop at Keith standing by the corpse.

225
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
I grab him by the shoulders.

226
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,200
Worry not about this vessel.

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,060
I'm not about you?

228
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,320
It is as much here as it ever was.

229
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,780
And it is not here.

230
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,080
Like it always wasn't.

231
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,700
Come up the stairs.

232
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,880
Let's go, Keith.

233
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,360
Same as it ever was.

234
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,780
There is water at the bottom of the ocean.

235
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,740
Keith is like just-

236
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
Pretty weirded out.

237
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,640
All right, Clark, come on.

238
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,200
Get past this and let's keep going.

239
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,040
I go past.

240
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,860
Okay.

241
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,200
I'm keeping my eyes open.

242
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
Okay.

243
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,860
Okay.

244
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
Nothing happens to me?

245
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,540
Nope.

246
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,360
Keith, I can look at the body, it seems like.

247
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,200
Okay, good.

248
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,040
I just didn't want-

249
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,860
It's face down.

250
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,560
You don't see any like blood or anything.

251
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,940
It's just a face down body.

252
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,500
So yeah, I mean, you could assume it's sleeping

253
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,320
if you want to rationalize it that way,

254
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,200
but you know based on the world that you've been living in

255
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,520
for the past however many, you know, whatevers.

256
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,360
It's probably dead.

257
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,580
Are there numbers and stuff all in this place too?

258
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,420
Any on the body?

259
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,700
Oh yeah, there's some on the body.

260
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,380
Anything that we've seen before?

261
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,220
Is it all-

262
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,280
Oh baby, we're in the wild west of numbers.

263
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,480
I turn back to Donovan.

264
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,140
Hey Donovan, you might, Keith's warning here,

265
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,660
you might want to shut them eyes.

266
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,860
Donovan is staring directly at the body.

267
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,020
But he's not like super phased by it

268
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
and he just like steps over it.

269
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,340
Oh, that was Jerry.

270
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,660
Didn't much care for him.

271
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
You actually see he's got a,

272
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
there is a notepad in Jerry's hand.

273
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,020
Who me?

274
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,860
Yeah.

275
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,700
Oh, couldn't be.

276
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,520
Do some investigating.

277
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,800
Hey, what is this?

278
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,620
Picks it up.

279
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,120
It's just a to-do list for tomorrow and it says retire.

280
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,380
Poor bastard.

281
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,700
It was wise of you to look closer.

282
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,060
I set up all kinds of jokes like these.

283
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,640
I continue up the stairs.

284
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,060
Clark, your friend's freaking me out.

285
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,320
John, you set this up?

286
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Did you?

287
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,780
Keith, did he ever leave your sight?

288
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,220
He never did, no.

289
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,240
I laugh as they try to understand.

290
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,740
I don't know what's going on with him.

291
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,420
I think he might've had a break.

292
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,620
You don't say.

293
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,500
Holy shit.

294
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,620
Let's keep going.

295
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,500
As you approach the top of the tower,

296
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,700
you hear a voice that is mumbling.

297
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,540
And that's just right, I just,

298
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,980
42 can't find it, you know?

299
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,280
If we can't get higher from this perspective,

300
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,520
then we gotta figure it out later.

301
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,360
Hello?

302
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Hello?

303
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,020
Oh, yes.

304
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,860
Oh my goodness.

305
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
Yes, peoples.

306
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,520
Yes, come on over.

307
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,240
Come on over to the top of the tower, please.

308
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
Can I see this person?

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
Yeah, as you approach,

310
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,240
it is an attractive girl who is in college age,

311
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,280
early twenties.

312
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,220
And she has two boobies.

313
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,920
God damn it.

314
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,760
No.

315
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,620
She has two buns on the back of her head, on her hair.

316
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,940
It's like grade A, grade A content.

317
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,780
And uh.

318
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,780
Subscribe to the Patreon.

319
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,060
Oh, thank you.

320
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,180
Luke cams on it.

321
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,180
I just want you to hear.

322
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,080
Oh, we're gonna make so much money.

323
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,920
On the Luke cam.

324
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,640
On the Luke cam.

325
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,400
Would you guys please help me get to the top of the tower?

326
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,280
And she's like got her hands on her head

327
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,880
and her eyes are wide and she's looking at all of you like,

328
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,160
oh my God, if you could just please take me to the two forts.

329
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
I can't take you to the top of the tower,

330
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,120
that'd be, that would just be fucking tits.

331
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,540
I look at her and I close my eyes and nod my head.

332
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
And is she still there when I open my eyes?

333
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,820
Everyone pull out your headphones

334
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,340
and then cover your ears real quick.

335
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,020
Hey Thomas, when John closes his eyes,

336
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,460
he just sees a mass of numbers flash before them.

337
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,220
And then he sees the visage of Clark Bishop age rapidly

338
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,420
and then age and reverse Benjamin Button style back down.

339
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,600
And then you see your own face take over for his face,

340
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,040
age in the same way and then age in reverse.

341
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,860
The beautiful topography of time.

342
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,480
As you open your eyes, she's still there.

343
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,360
And she's like, I don't think it,

344
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,780
can anyone get me to the top physically

345
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,400
with their bodies and hands and stuff?

346
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,240
What's your name?

347
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,920
Oh, my name is Sham Wow.

348
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,880
That's unfortunate.

349
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,440
No, it's Sham Wow Chameleon.

350
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,520
You didn't hear the whole thing.

351
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Fucking millennials.

352
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,980
What's at the top?

353
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,140
Higher than this.

354
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,100
I'm just trying to get higher, baby.

355
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,780
Gotta take me higher.

356
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,620
Four, three, two, six.

357
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,500
Well, why do you need somebody to take you up there?

358
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,660
Well, because it's harder for me to do it

359
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,780
because I can't climb this rope.

360
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,940
And she points at the rope that the giant bell is on.

361
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,380
I'm afraid if I jump onto the bell by myself,

362
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,260
I won't be able to climb all the way and I'll fall and die.

363
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
I don't wanna fall and die.

364
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,620
So I wanna get to the top of the tower.

365
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
I wanna get higher tippy top.

366
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,640
If you had to think of any numbers in the universe,

367
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,480
what would they be?

368
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
Clark is getting his punching hand ready?

369
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Immediately Leon Simpson puts on

370
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,400
his noise canceling headphones.

371
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,040
Are we at the top of this other than like climbing

372
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,880
up the rope to the bell?

373
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,080
Are we at the top of the tower?

374
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,920
Yes.

375
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,740
Cool.

376
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,580
There's lots of names.

377
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,700
There's numbers.

378
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,960
There's so many numbers.

379
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,040
They're inside my brain

380
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,840
and they keep coming out all over the place.

381
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,680
And you would not believe the week ahead,

382
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,700
but I guess like if I had to think about the ones

383
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,940
that speak to me most truly,

384
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,940
it would be 811-818-9520-1318-1119.

385
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,720
And all the rest of them are also in here,

386
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,340
but they're all over the place sideways

387
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,860
and on top of each other.

388
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,020
And it's just constant and it's all inside,

389
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,860
but I gotta get higher.

390
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,260
Was that Harriet?

391
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,100
Yeah.

392
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm pretty sure it was.

393
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,760
Harriet.

394
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,580
Oh, you know Harriet.

395
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,420
Did you?

396
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,260
I know Harriet.

397
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,100
I know you.

398
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,380
I know everyone on your campus.

399
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,620
I know your mother, your father.

400
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,280
That's wild.

401
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,480
You know, the chameleons.

402
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,640
John, thanks for a minute.

403
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,120
And it's like, they're not coming to mind right now,

404
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
but yes, of course.

405
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,560
Wow.

406
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,380
Did you know Harriet?

407
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
Marks?

408
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,060
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,880
Yeah, I mean, not too many people

410
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,020
are named Harriet these days.

411
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,080
Can you get me higher?

412
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,280
What do you need up there for?

413
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,520
I just gotta get higher.

414
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Number one.

415
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,800
Number one, I gotta get higher.

416
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
Are you working on the scavenger hunt?

417
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,940
Yes, for sure.

418
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,360
But most importantly, gotta get higher than I am here.

419
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,740
This is the highest spot I've been

420
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,040
and the highest spot I can be,

421
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,600
but I could get higher with you guys' help

422
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,760
if you wanna help me get higher.

423
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,520
Do you know what would happen if you got higher?

424
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,720
Feel good.

425
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,080
I wanna look around and see if I can find like a clue

426
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,600
that would have led us here.

427
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,280
She grabs onto Donovan's like shirt

428
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,960
and is like, take me higher.

429
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,500
I don't, no, I don't wanna talk to you.

430
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,600
Roll search for me.

431
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
What are you looking for?

432
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,960
Just like another clue, like why we came up here.

433
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Sure.

434
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,620
35 on a 40.

435
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah, so looking out from the bell tower,

436
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,500
you very clearly see across the way,

437
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,740
there is a sleigh that is completely lit up in lights

438
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,900
that is on top of a building across campus,

439
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,660
which Donovan, you would know is the Accord Student Center.

440
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,140
We drove here in an Accord.

441
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,200
You think there's any connection?

442
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,740
Donovan, what's that sleigh?

443
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,940
That's the Accord Student Center.

444
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,100
That's where a lot of people meet up.

445
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,620
Perhaps a ball could be there?

446
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,820
In the sleigh is a brightly lit sign

447
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,560
that points to a light up chimney.

448
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,560
And the sign says in all caps, the jingle ball is this way.

449
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,080
You guys, I think that might be where we need to go next.

450
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,920
Are you telling me we did a scavenger hunt

451
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,960
to be told that the jingle ball was at the student union?

452
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,500
And that we're all balls are held?

453
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,280
Yeah, what's the problem is a really hard rule to solve.

454
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
Hey, y'all remember how we might all be balls?

455
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,440
You think there's something to do that?

456
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,220
Jingle balls, balls.

457
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,820
I'm not convinced I'm ball.

458
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,080
Let's go back to that.

459
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
You said that you're all balls?

460
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
No, my child.

461
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,520
Can you take me higher?

462
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,360
You're all balls though?

463
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,200
Would you just do the top of the thing?

464
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm sorry, you said that you all were balls.

465
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
You'd like to be.

466
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,440
I just need to get on top of this bell tower

467
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,280
as fast as possible.

468
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,600
I wouldn't listen to John right now.

469
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,100
You can hear how he's been talking some gibberish.

470
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,720
I just, he's just out of it right now.

471
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,560
Well, persuade.

472
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,620
I'd like to confess his rule.

473
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,460
Oh, okay.

474
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
You can roll persuade.

475
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,800
Profits are never appreciated in their own time.

476
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,660
No, they die.

477
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,940
I keep sending them though.

478
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,780
81.

479
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,860
Yeah, okay.

480
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
That's fair.

481
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,700
I guess balls.

482
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
So if you could just take me

483
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,100
to the very top of this bell tower,

484
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,940
it's just right around.

485
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,660
So you see how it's open right here?

486
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,940
I think if you two of you stand right on the edge,

487
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,160
you can hold my feet with your hands on your knees,

488
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,480
maybe thigh, maybe I could get some upper thigh

489
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:10,080
and then I could work my way up

490
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
with my sleek rock climbing abilities

491
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,040
to get even on top of the tower even more.

492
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm kind of ignoring this person

493
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,240
and I look at, we don't need to help.

494
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,720
Well, I was thinking we might as well just help her

495
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,920
and then get over the ball.

496
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,520
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

497
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,360
I'll see you there.

498
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,640
I have a feeling she's gonna follow us

499
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,440
and annoy us if we don't do this for her.

500
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
Plus I just wanna see what happens.

501
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,020
You guys could take me higher

502
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,980
and that's who I wanna be.

503
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,180
If you could take me to the Christmas sky,

504
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,060
I could feel it with all of my might.

505
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,740
I get down to like in the position she told us to get

506
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,980
and I just kind of look over.

507
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,300
I look over at Clark and kind of shrug my shoulders.

508
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,860
I just feel like we're leading this person to their death.

509
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,300
They're gonna fall off that rope.

510
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,820
I look over at Donovan and I'm pointing in front of me

511
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,140
and I shrug my shoulder.

512
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,460
I have an idea.

513
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
Clark, will you strike this woman down

514
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,320
as you did the others?

515
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,560
I'm not too bright, Clark,

516
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,680
but I think it would solve all our problems

517
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,000
if you struck this woman.

518
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,640
Clark cracks his knuckles.

519
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
It's like, well, that's true.

520
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I could just knock her out.

521
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,640
John moves in front of her.

522
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
If you're gonna knock her out,

523
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,680
we might as well help her keep her dreams.

524
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,920
My savior, take me higher.

525
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,120
John holds his hands up in front of him

526
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,440
and he's like, Clark.

527
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,720
Our John is an awesome John.

528
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,340
He reigns from heaven above with hands.

529
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,420
I keep one hand pointed out to John,

530
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,700
but I put one hand behind me and I put it on her forehead.

531
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
Your John.

532
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,300
With her hand on my forehead, take me higher, Satan.

533
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,740
Is anybody gonna help me out here?

534
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,980
Honestly, I have no idea what's happening anymore.

535
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,860
I just feel like if we help her onto this rope,

536
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,700
that's a death sentence for her.

537
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,260
Well, you're gonna punch her, so.

538
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,220
It'd just knock her out though.

539
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,060
That wouldn't kill her.

540
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,680
Just so many potential complications.

541
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,240
We could also just leave.

542
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,080
We don't have to.

543
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
No, no, you don't have to leave.

544
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,920
Come on, God.

545
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,980
You're gonna make me leave with your hand upon my skin?

546
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,000
I will help you, my child.

547
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,560
And Keith Vigner, are you gonna help us out?

548
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,520
Yeah, I'm gonna help too.

549
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,360
Sick.

550
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,720
All right, so between the two of you,

551
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,440
who has the better luck?

552
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,840
I have 35 him.

553
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,000
I'll have you roll it.

554
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,120
A three.

555
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,020
Oh!

556
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,420
You help her out the little opening

557
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,440
that's looking out onto the campus,

558
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,020
and she is starting to climb up,

559
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,540
clearly misses with one of her hands and begins to fall,

560
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,580
but you catch her legs,

561
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,780
and she immediately holds on with both

562
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,500
and then fucking sends it,

563
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,220
getting a full grip of the gargantuan inflatable minion

564
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,400
that tops this CSU bell tower.

565
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,300
You hear the swooshing of final coated nylon,

566
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,540
and then...

567
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,380
I'm higher!

568
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,100
Ooh, yeah, eight, one, whoa, ooh, yeah,

569
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,220
it's fun, four, five, six, seven, eight,

570
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,100
kind of, you gotta get it up on the sky

571
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
with the Christmas spirit,

572
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,380
and my God fell into helping me aware

573
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,020
whose phone is ringing while we're recording a podcast.

574
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,860
Fucking Justin.

575
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,100
I'm sorry, it's all right, I'm hearing it.

576
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Oh, there we go.

577
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,080
Are we good now, is that, is it over?

578
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,920
Yeah, I feel better, let's go to the ball.

579
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,060
Yeah, let's head on down.

580
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,400
It's time to finally get my prize I deserve.

581
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,520
How is she gonna get down from up there though, guys?

582
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,000
She got up there pretty easily, so.

583
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,220
With the help, okay.

584
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,560
The world works in mysterious ways.

585
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,200
I go down the stairs.

586
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,120
You see the security guard on your way back.

587
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,960
Hey, Jerry.

588
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,680
Same spot, but he'll hop over.

589
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,560
And then at the bottom of the staircase,

590
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,020
you guys enter the, essentially the quad of this campus,

591
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,340
and you head over to the Accord Student Union

592
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,900
that is just across the way.

593
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,620
And as you walk up to it,

594
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,060
you see that there are a couple different entrances.

595
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
There are three in front of you.

596
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,780
You can go left, center, or right.

597
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,820
Are any of them lit?

598
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,580
John just walked straight through the center door

599
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,860
without waiting for discussion.

600
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,700
Right on.

601
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,860
Follow John?

602
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,740
I guess.

603
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,980
Yeah, I'll follow John, are we all following John?

604
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,820
Let's head in.

605
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,800
He seems really confident now.

606
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Are we following the guy who was rolling around earlier?

607
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,080
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
He actually does a little roll through the door.

609
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Donovan, he's not always like this.

610
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
In fact, it's a little worrisome.

611
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,920
I just am trying to keep the eye on the prize right now

612
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,120
and figure that out later, I guess.

613
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,700
Yeah, seems smart.

614
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,960
As you guys walk in, the lights are off.

615
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,720
However, there is a path of colorful string lights

616
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,020
on the ground, like a pathway or a road.

617
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,460
You notice that there is a little sitting area to your left

618
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,780
where there are some tables and chairs set up.

619
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,300
And sitting in one of the chairs is a corpse

620
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,220
that is quite fermented.

621
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,980
It has been here for some time, you would guess,

622
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,820
by the looks of it.

623
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,820
And right next to that corpse is a very alive person

624
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,680
dancing their ass off.

625
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,840
Just fucking getting it.

626
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,480
I've seen pictures of Amelia, is this her?

627
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,320
Nope.

628
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,240
Hey, where's the ball?

629
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,040
The dancing fiend continues their grind

630
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,060
and with their hips motions in the way that you're headed.

631
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,280
Thank you, thank you very much.

632
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,240
I go that way.

633
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,680
I'll continue on too, yeah.

634
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,080
That's not Tim Fate with.

635
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,900
I dance with him for a little while.

636
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,060
It's just like a few bars,

637
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,140
like I am grooving to the beat and then I walk on.

638
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,060
Easy peasy.

639
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,220
You would notice that the student union is-

640
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,640
They have no idea.

641
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,180
The path of colorful lights and thumping holiday base

642
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,900
leads the five of you,

643
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,220
four imposters in city PD uniforms

644
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,240
and a nicely dressed fifth year college student

645
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,220
to a three story atrium,

646
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,580
kind of like a small square shopping mall.

647
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,560
But instead of Forever 21 and Orange Julius,

648
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,400
there's a CSU merch shop and a subway.

649
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,600
You're on the middle level,

650
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,720
so looking down you see the basement of this atrium

651
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,840
and it's decked out in jingle ball decorations.

652
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,160
But in drastic contrast to this festive cheer,

653
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,240
you are surrounded only by pure chaos,

654
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,600
personified by obsessive college students and faculty.

655
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,920
Across the atrium on your level,

656
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,100
there's a girl shaving the fur off a team of reindeer

657
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,900
in front of a photo backdrop

658
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,820
and she is shaking and gluing the loose fur to her own skin.

659
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,940
On the bottom level,

660
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,180
a pair of very tall and muscular men in Santa outfits

661
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,060
are diligently wrapping a college student

662
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,740
in gift wrapping paper.

663
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,740
They are using duct tape and force.

664
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,700
An older woman in a bathrobe

665
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,300
and one of those fur lined leather aviator hats

666
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,640
that cover your ears is climbing a thick garland

667
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,840
from this level up to the top.

668
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,040
The garland wraps around these columns

669
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,360
that encircle the opening to the atrium

670
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,400
every 10 yards or so

671
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,880
and they all meet in the center of the dome

672
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,640
atop this part of the Accord Student Union here at CSU.

673
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Hanging from the middle of this dome

674
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,400
is a massive disco ball, 10 yards in diameter,

675
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,360
wearing an equally huge Santa hat.

676
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,700
That's college, baby.

677
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,180
That's college.

678
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,220
Three people in elf costumes

679
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,320
are in the corner of the lower level

680
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,020
in a little ice skating rink

681
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,300
with a life-size Frosty the Snowman figure.

682
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,920
They keep putting the carrot in different places

683
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,420
while laughing hysterically.

684
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,380
A naked man is using a mop and a mop bucket full of paint

685
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,300
to write out a sequence of numbers

686
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,980
at the bottom of the stairs to the lower level.

687
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,540
Across the room on the bottom floor,

688
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,480
there is a young woman throwing a laptop in the air

689
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,840
and trying to spin around in a circle before catching it.

690
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,000
She is doing this fervently

691
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,160
and she's wearing a shirt that says,

692
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,160
gifts house on the back and best RA ever on the front.

693
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,840
It says, if I make it this far,

694
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,120
a dude doing squats on top of Santa Claus's throne stops

695
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,680
and begins violently chanting,

696
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Towel alico, towel alico, towel alico, towel alico.

697
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,080
That's college, baby.

698
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,140
I look at the man who's chanting and I just,

699
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,780
I just boom out.

700
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,040
I command you to stop.

701
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,880
Roll.

702
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,020
And I wave my hand, I just gotta wave a hand at him.

703
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,120
Roll persuade for me.

704
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:00,620
Got a 76 on a, probably not higher than that.

705
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,280
We're sitting in new places

706
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,600
and it's hard for me to see my character sheet.

707
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,100
No, that's a fail.

708
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Towel alico, towel alico, towel alico.

709
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,680
And when he keeps going,

710
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,240
I kind of look at my hand in confusion.

711
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,280
John, who were you talking to, was that man?

712
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,640
Oh, you were, gotcha.

713
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,880
I look at Clark, I get my gun out

714
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,000
and I like look at him and point it at the guy

715
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
and like questioning the look in my eyes.

716
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,260
John's just nodding.

717
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,840
He must be punished.

718
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,780
Towel alico, whatever, what's that?

719
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,860
I've heard it before, but I,

720
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,420
It sounds like a spell, right?

721
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,540
That's what I'm thinking and I think we need to stop it.

722
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,420
Do we remember what it is?

723
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,900
So far, I don't know.

724
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,460
It could have done a number of things.

725
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,020
Listen, it's been a while since we played, but that is,

726
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,860
We've heard it a lot.

727
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,680
We've heard it a lot, right?

728
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,520
I just don't remember what it does.

729
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,840
I don't think it's done anything yet.

730
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,540
Isn't it just the phrase?

731
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,780
I punched your brother's partner

732
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,000
when you started saying it.

733
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,660
Yeah, so we've stopped everybody.

734
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,500
It's done it so far.

735
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,060
Yeah, maybe we have stopped it every time.

736
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,440
Yeah, so I'm like looking at,

737
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,320
Keith is looking at Clark ready to shoot this guy just,

738
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,280
I don't know why I'm asking for permission this time, but.

739
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,560
Clark shrugs.

740
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,400
I fire.

741
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,840
Roll firearms.

742
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,680
That's a two.

743
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,320
So anyway, I started blasting.

744
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,640
Holy shit, all right, cool, so.

745
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,160
Hey, maybe we should make a role-playing decision

746
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,940
that's not shooting up a college.

747
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,980
Fucking food court.

748
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,820
They're monsters.

749
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,880
Too late, so roll damage for me.

750
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,180
A nine.

751
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh my God.

752
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,340
Where do you shoot him?

753
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Right in chest.

754
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,180
Yep.

755
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,060
As two shots hit this man, center mass,

756
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,300
he falls back into the throne of one Santa Claus

757
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,080
and begins bleeding as he continues to slowly,

758
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,740
quietly chant,

759
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,540
Oh, and he succeeds on a constitution check

760
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,320
and stays conscious,

761
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,040
but fewer can hear his chant.

762
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,080
Does the crowd react at all?

763
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
Yes, absolutely.

764
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,400
The crowd a hundred percent reacts, so.

765
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,920
Yay, I'm the star of the show now.

766
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,260
Everybody look at me.

767
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,100
Spotlight online.

768
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,020
I'm the DJ now.

769
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,980
As soon as you fire the gun,

770
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,760
everyone in this room turns and looks at the five of you.

771
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,300
Everyone then looks at the Santa throne

772
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,500
where this man is bleeding all over while still chanting.

773
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,300
Reindeer fur girl immediately turns and begins sharpening

774
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,140
one of the horns on one of these live reindeer.

775
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,220
The Santa twins.

776
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
Wait, these are live reindeer?

777
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,160
Oh yeah, baby.

778
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,000
Oh shit.

779
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Was not aware of that.

780
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,440
Yeah, I definitely thought he just

781
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,840
more fucked up reindeer.

782
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,200
Were they letting her shave them willingly

783
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
or were they struggling again?

784
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,360
She was cutting off their fur.

785
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,560
They're tied up for a photo shoot

786
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,080
and she's cutting off their fur with a blunt knife

787
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,320
that she carries with her.

788
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,520
Holy shit.

789
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,360
Should have shot her first.

790
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,640
Yeah, that's not cool.

791
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,880
So she begins sharpening one of these reindeer's horns.

792
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,540
The Santa twins, the two giant muscular men

793
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,500
dressed as Santa Claus, start wrapping each other

794
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,780
as opposed to this undergrad that they were wrapping before

795
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,700
and they're using duct tape to wrap around

796
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,580
the gift wrapping on each other.

797
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,660
I wanted to ask about that guy who's being wrapped.

798
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,680
Does he seem under the same spell as everyone

799
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,420
or was he maybe fighting against them?

800
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,900
He was compulsively staying as still as possible.

801
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,740
Gotcha.

802
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,960
Cousin Eddie Lady Climber starts climbing faster

803
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,100
and faster up this garland and is trying desperately

804
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,300
to end like to the point to where she's like

805
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,500
losing grip on the garland and still making it up.

806
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,060
She's in very good shape.

807
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,940
The three elves in the corner, they begin sitting

808
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,820
on the ground and unlacing their ice skates.

809
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,220
The naked mop man begins squeezing paint back

810
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,540
into his mop bucket and the girl throwing the laptop

811
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,200
in the air begins throwing it way higher

812
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,520
than she was before, so much higher.

813
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,760
Like she's throwing this laptop 20 feet in the air

814
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,680
every time and still catching it currently.

815
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,500
Luke, you had a question?

816
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,360
So there's the basement level, the middle level

817
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,040
that we're on and then an upper level?

818
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,880
Yes.

819
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,920
Okay, who's on the basement level?

820
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,560
The basement level is the man who is in the throne

821
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,040
of Santa Claus who is chanting and bleeding out currently.

822
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,880
The Santa twins are on the basement level as well

823
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,640
who are wrapping each other with gift wrapping

824
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,980
and duct tape.

825
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,040
The three elves in the ice skating rink are also

826
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,540
in the basement level as is the naked mop man

827
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,540
who is squeezing paint back into his mop bucket

828
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,980
as is the laptop girl.

829
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,780
Luke, ask him your real question.

830
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,260
What have we talked about?

831
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,100
Ask him what it's like to have sex.

832
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,940
You can ask me anything Luke.

833
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,080
Ask him what it's like to have sex.

834
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,660
That's for later, that's not on the packet.

835
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,740
I wanna know.

836
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,900
Who's on the level we're on?

837
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,900
I want you to show me.

838
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,080
Make him tell us.

839
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,280
On your level.

840
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,840
Who's on our level?

841
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,700
Thomas.

842
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,320
On your level is the reindeer fur girl

843
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,920
and then on the next level climbing up to the next level

844
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,600
is the cousin lady climber.

845
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,040
Gotcha, thank you.

846
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,400
I wanna draw my pistol if I can.

847
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,040
Yeah, we're in free play right now

848
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,960
so you can do whatever you want.

849
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah, I don't know.

850
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,640
Are we starting combat?

851
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,460
No, we are, yeah.

852
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,300
Okay, cool.

853
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,600
I draw my pistol and point it at the reindeer girl

854
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,800
and I say, touch not mine creatures

855
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,920
and then I look at my gun and I'm like,

856
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,120
I must use these mortal instruments

857
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,000
to achieve my divine means.

858
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,840
Fire, I aim in fire.

859
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,480
Okay, so she is across the atrium from you

860
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,000
so as you say that.

861
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
I got a 65.

862
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,620
You're just assuming that as you speak

863
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,080
that she'll be able to hear you

864
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,880
regardless of the volume of your voice.

865
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm assuming.

866
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,600
Who are you talking to now, John?

867
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,660
Putting it out into the universe,

868
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,860
which is me.

869
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,100
Roll firearms for me.

870
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
I am the universe experience in itself.

871
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,940
43 on a 60.

872
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,840
All right, roll a D10 for damage.

873
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,900
Seven.

874
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,500
She gets hit once in the shoulder,

875
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,360
immediately falls to the ground

876
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,900
and the bullet goes through

877
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,340
and one of the reindeer's

878
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,580
and then falls over as well

879
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,500
and she is on the ground bleeding

880
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,320
as she tries to grab on to the hairless reindeer

881
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,820
in front of her to help herself up.

882
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,000
She goes limp and her head just like hits the ground.

883
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,200
Can I have Mercy kill that reindeer real quick?

884
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,720
The look on Zach's face just now is, huh.

885
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,560
I just threw up.

886
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,600
You're the one who made me shoot a fucking reindeer.

887
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,240
I just want to resolve that as quickly as possible.

888
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,880
I'm just telling the story, man.

889
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,840
This is just what happened.

890
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,040
It's not my fault.

891
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,160
It's not your fault.

892
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,040
Life is chaos.

893
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,540
Dude, you can't change the past.

894
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,960
Go for it.

895
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,960
97.

896
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,780
God damn it.

897
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,880
I shoot another reindeer.

898
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,760
That's going to be a fucked up photo shoot.

899
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,160
Well, she fucked it up by shaving him already.

900
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,820
Sorry about that.

901
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,660
Did you just shake your-

902
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,700
He just grabbed his McDonald's cup and shook it.

903
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,380
That was habit.

904
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,340
Oh boy.

905
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,160
Okay.

906
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,000
Love that.

907
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,060
How many drankies are left in here?

908
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,140
We're better than this.

909
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,080
Maybe, I don't know.

910
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,740
I am.

911
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,580
You're not.

912
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,500
I hope that's your character talking.

913
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,340
Hey Donovan.

914
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,160
Hey.

915
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,300
Hey, what are you thinking, man?

916
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,580
Mildly panicked.

917
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,400
Uh-huh.

918
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,840
Do you want to go ahead and roll sanity for me?

919
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,680
Yeah.

920
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,360
I don't know what to roll it against.

921
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,020
You'll roll against a,

922
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,100
I think based on the week that you've had,

923
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,400
you're going to roll it against a pretty solid 58.

924
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,240
Sounds right.

925
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,220
54.

926
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,060
Very well done.

927
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,900
Okay.

928
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,460
You can hold yourself together for the time being,

929
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,480
but just so you know,

930
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,380
this is the first time that Donovan,

931
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,260
I'm assuming has seen anyone get shot

932
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,980
or maybe even any animal.

933
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,800
Yes.

934
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,640
Oh, for sure.

935
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,860
You've never seen a reindeer get blasted in the face.

936
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,700
Raw vegan?

937
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,520
Yeah.

938
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,740
Only sprouts for this boy.

939
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,140
You know what?

940
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,960
That's really cool.

941
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,800
I really respect that.

942
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,640
Thank you.

943
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,020
Anyway.

944
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,140
I think Donovan, after the first gunshot,

945
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,220
it's like, what the fuck?

946
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,420
And like freaking out.

947
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,020
Cause it's the first time a gun has been fired

948
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,460
probably in his vicinity ever.

949
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,300
Yeah.

950
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,120
And it is quite frightening.

951
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,780
I would imagine to a fifth year college student.

952
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,620
It's yeah.

953
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,900
It's the first time he's seen a gun since high school.

954
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,720
Yeah.

955
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,060
Or violence.

956
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,980
Wow.

957
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,040
So America has an epidemic of gun violence.

958
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,120
So as the second gunshot rings out,

959
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,200
everyone begins to panic and obsess a little bit harder.

960
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,780
If Clark wanted to get to the girl

961
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,680
who was throwing the laptop, how would he do that?

962
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,520
He wants to do that.

963
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,340
Okay.

964
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,840
So you would have to go down the stairs

965
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,280
into the basement of the atrium

966
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,280
and then past the Santa twins and the naked mop man

967
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,940
before you got to the laptop girl.

968
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm going to yell at the guys, cover me.

969
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,460
And I'm going down the stairs.

970
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,380
So you take off running.

971
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,060
If they successfully cover you,

972
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,980
then you'll make it there no problem.

973
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
Well, I mean, I have my own wherewithal.

974
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,820
If something, if something wants to stop me,

975
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,560
I get to, I get to fight back,

976
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,580
but I'm hoping that they'll.

977
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,700
Leon is going to be like, I'm with you.

978
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,660
And is joining you.

979
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,460
I hear him yell to cover him.

980
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,540
And the first person between him

981
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,620
and the top girl is the twins.

982
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,460
Yes.

983
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,100
I'm going to run behind with him.

984
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,660
But right before I start going down the stairs,

985
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,400
take a shot at the one on the left.

986
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,240
All right.

987
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,060
Roll firearms.

988
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,800
That's a one.

989
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,640
Okay.

990
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,480
I say.

991
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,480
Celebratory shake.

992
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,920
We've got our own manual drops.

993
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,760
As I do it, I hear Clark say, cover me.

994
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,240
And I'm like, hell yeah, Clark.

995
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,360
And then I look directly into the eyes of that twin.

996
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,860
And I say, I'm the bill of the ball.

997
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
Ding, ding.

998
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,300
And then pull the gun and shoot him

999
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,500
right between the eyeballs.

1000
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,340
Yeah.

1001
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,160
And Santa dies.

1002
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,540
You're the new Santa Claus.

1003
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,220
Look at me.

1004
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,040
I'm the Santa now.

1005
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,380
The other Santa does not miss a beat.

1006
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,620
Grabs the duct tape out of the hand of his fellow Santa

1007
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,500
as the man just drops to the ground.

1008
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
The duct tape being the only thing left.

1009
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,120
And he just smoothly continues wrapping himself

1010
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,040
in this duct tape.

1011
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,860
I would look at Clark.

1012
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,320
I'm like, they may, they seem like they may not be

1013
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
our biggest obstacles.

1014
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,360
Yeah, they're gonna take care of themselves here, so.

1015
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,880
And I follow suit.

1016
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
Clark is running at the laptop girl.

1017
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,640
Yeah.

1018
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,360
The Santa guys are taking care of themselves.

1019
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,100
No one's fucking with any more reindeer.

1020
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,040
Are there any threats we see around us?

1021
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,000
You've got old lady maybe potentially climbing your way

1022
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
or was she above us already?

1023
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,040
Climbing to the second floor.

1024
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,320
Climbing from the second to the third floor.

1025
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,820
And we're on the second floor?

1026
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,640
Yeah.

1027
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,480
Can I reach her?

1028
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,700
Like if I reached over the edge, could I like grab her?

1029
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,860
You'd have to like run around the side

1030
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,080
and then probably get on the garland yourself

1031
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,740
and begin climbing before you got to her.

1032
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,700
Cause she, when those first gunshots rang out,

1033
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,040
she really started going for it.

1034
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,340
She's free soloing this bitch like a moat.

1035
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,380
I just watched that.

1036
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,540
It was so fucking good.

1037
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,700
I mean, I know everybody said it and that's old news, but.

1038
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,740
My hands are sweaty.

1039
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,060
Unrelated.

1040
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,780
Yeah, I want to shoot the old broad.

1041
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,660
Jesus Christ.

1042
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm kidding.

1043
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm going to cover, I'm going to cover Joe.

1044
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,960
Clark, I want to see.

1045
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,800
Oh yeah.

1046
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,920
Can you ready an action in Delta Green?

1047
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,400
You can ready an action in Delta Green.

1048
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,160
So I'm going to be on Overwatch for Clark.

1049
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,000
Dope.

1050
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,820
Sounds good, Justin.

1051
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,660
What's Donovan doing?

1052
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,360
He pulls out his grenade launcher.

1053
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Is there like a weapon nearby that like,

1054
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,720
like even like a bat or a plant,

1055
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,000
it's like some kind of thing I could use

1056
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,660
as a makeshift weapon just to like arm myself.

1057
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,560
Actually, as you're looking around for a makeshift weapon.

1058
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,000
You see a bat flying around

1059
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,220
and you just grab it out of the air

1060
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,860
and chuck it at one of the Santas.

1061
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,480
You become Batman.

1062
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,320
Bad man?

1063
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,140
Bad man.

1064
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,980
So as.

1065
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,820
Badminton?

1066
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,660
Badminton.

1067
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,500
So as you're shuttle cocking your way,

1068
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,100
Leon Simpson, halfway down the stairs,

1069
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,260
turns and goes, shit, Clark, I forgot.

1070
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,820
And runs right back up the stairs

1071
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,340
and throws a gun to Donovan

1072
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,460
and then grabs you by the shoulder

1073
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,040
and takes you like around a corner

1074
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,540
where you both can watch,

1075
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,300
but you're a little bit safer away from everything.

1076
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,700
Sounds like a good plan.

1077
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,420
I mean, you can get out there if you want,

1078
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,980
but I would rather you didn't

1079
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,940
based on the fact that as of now our current theory

1080
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,140
is that you're our savior.

1081
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,300
Oh, that's like a lot to put on me, but I, sure.

1082
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,080
You're gonna do great things in this world

1083
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,420
and if you don't, it's on you.

1084
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,100
He just like gets really sad

1085
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,500
and looks down at the ground.

1086
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay.

1087
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,420
Okay, so you understand

1088
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,980
that you should probably not die today?

1089
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,520
That was my, that was kind of my plan was not to be dead.

1090
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,560
I think we're good to go.

1091
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,400
Thanks.

1092
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,220
So.

1093
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,460
Wait, wait, wait, how do I use this?

1094
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,720
Oh, right, and then he shows you how to use it,

1095
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,560
but like very quickly.

1096
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,160
Yeah, I'll definitely remember, I'm smart.

1097
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,000
Roll a 50-50 shot on whether or not

1098
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,800
you know how to use this gun at all.

1099
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,280
Do I like flip a coin?

1100
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,600
Just roll, if you roll under 50,

1101
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,040
you know how to do it, yeah.

1102
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,240
Under 50.

1103
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,020
With that, we'll give you a 30% in firearms.

1104
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Ooh.

1105
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,860
Nice.

1106
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,180
It feels natural.

1107
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,220
Why have I not been using this all this time?

1108
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,100
Your new friends certainly like doing it.

1109
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,760
So, the Santa twin that's left,

1110
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,900
the lady climbing up the garland,

1111
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,500
all three elves, the naked mop man,

1112
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,140
and the girl throwing the laptop in the air,

1113
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,780
all stop what they're doing

1114
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,380
and begin chanting.

1115
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,240
Tall, we allow the call.

1116
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,120
Tall, we allow the call.

1117
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,000
Tall, we allow the call.

1118
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,720
Tall, we allow the call.

1119
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,120
The man in the throne of the Santa Claus dressing

1120
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,080
runs and jumps onto,

1121
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,760
so there's like a four poster chair

1122
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,040
for the elf that sits next to him,

1123
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,520
and he jumps on it with his neck landing directly on,

1124
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,760
what are those called at the top of like a four poster?

1125
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,960
Like a spinet?

1126
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,000
We'll call it a spinet.

1127
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,020
And if that's not a word,

1128
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,700
that's what it means now.

1129
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,140
Post?

1130
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,380
At the top of a post.

1131
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,820
What do you call that thing?

1132
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,140
An uppy pointy,

1133
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,340
just a straight up and downer.

1134
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,180
So he jumps on the chair stalagmite.

1135
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,180
It's like a line, but round.

1136
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,140
And punctures his own throat

1137
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,340
and immediately just like,

1138
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,860
and begins bleeding.

1139
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,380
Did it look purposeful or accidental?

1140
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,040
It looked extremely purposeful

1141
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,760
and the chants get louder from everyone else.

1142
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,800
Clark, it's your turn.

1143
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
The laptop is in the air and you have made your way there.

1144
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,280
What do you want to do?

1145
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,480
I've made my time to her.

1146
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,900
Yep, she is chanting and no longer,

1147
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,280
and no longer paying attention to the laptop

1148
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,560
that is in the air about 20 feet in the air.

1149
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,680
I don't know how many actions this is,

1150
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,120
but I'd like to catch the laptop

1151
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,240
so it doesn't hit the ground,

1152
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,600
but knock her in the chin.

1153
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,900
Just see if it clocks her.

1154
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,320
Is that the way she's throwing it?

1155
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,160
I could do that, yeah.

1156
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,860
It'll land directly on her head if you do nothing.

1157
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,700
Oh, I'll do nothing then.

1158
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,600
Yeah, if it's coming down on her.

1159
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,560
Let's see what happens.

1160
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,560
I'll just see what happens there.

1161
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,160
I'll let that play out and then I'll see what I do.

1162
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,920
Oh my God.

1163
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,780
The laptop comes down in such a way

1164
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,240
that the most sturdy edge comes down directly on her temple

1165
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,560
because as she's chanting,

1166
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,600
she's turning her head to the side completely

1167
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,540
in this weird like you just said squirrel

1168
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,180
to a dog kind of way.

1169
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,300
It hits her directly above the ear in the side of the head

1170
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,860
and she goes blank, roll luck for me.

1171
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,380
I'm using new dice that my mom got me for Christmas.

1172
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,020
Ooh, mama dice.

1173
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,160
They're good, 54 on a 65.

1174
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,000
Nice.

1175
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,340
That will come into play later.

1176
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,100
Okay, so did it knock her out?

1177
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,220
It knocked her out cold.

1178
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,600
Okay, I want to grab the laptop and her

1179
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,980
and run retreat back to the second floor.

1180
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,840
Okay, so you can get a hold of them this round,

1181
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,520
but you won't be able to make it all the way back.

1182
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,000
You can start your way there.

1183
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,840
What is Keith Vigna doing?

1184
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,560
He sees that happen and looks at the people chanting.

1185
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,640
Are they looking at us or just kind of out of it?

1186
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,760
They are all staring at one of you.

1187
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,200
I look at one of the elves and he's staring right at me.

1188
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,040
Oh yeah.

1189
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,860
I see down.

1190
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,040
And he's taken off his ice skating skate.

1191
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,380
Yeah, I see down about two feet away from me

1192
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,860
is a candy cane, but the end is sharpened

1193
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,580
like you're supposed to stick it in your lawn.

1194
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,420
100%.

1195
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,820
And I grab it and I spear it right at him.

1196
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,820
Roll.

1197
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,660
Roll spear.

1198
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,820
Roll athletics for me.

1199
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,540
83 on a 50.

1200
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,780
You run down the stairs with this sharpened candy cane

1201
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,720
and you launch it at your elven foe.

1202
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,140
And it just skies and it lands directly

1203
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,460
in the head of Frosty the snowman.

1204
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,300
Do they laugh?

1205
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,120
And it gets stuck there.

1206
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,560
So there's a candy cane coming out

1207
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,060
in between the two button eyes.

1208
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,900
What are the eyes?

1209
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,720
Coal.

1210
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,460
And it goes right into the button nose

1211
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,420
and the elves die laughing

1212
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,820
and they're giggling their asses off as they're

1213
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:29,660
Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool,

1214
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,620
Tommy Lally Cool, Tommy Lally Cool, wow!

1215
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,520
Now Zach, are these really Santa's elves

1216
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,340
or are they just people pretending to be Santa's elves?

1217
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,180
You don't know.

1218
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,720
Roll a cult.

1219
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,020
38 on a 10.

1220
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,160
Those ears look real, baby.

1221
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,520
Give one a tug if I can.

1222
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,900
You can give one a tug if you want

1223
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,060
cause it's your turn, John Lee Pettymore.

1224
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,360
What's the naked guy doing?

1225
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,880
He has put the mop down

1226
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,280
and he is putting the mop bucket up against the wall

1227
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,180
and he's beginning to dip his head into the paint

1228
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,620
that's in this mop bucket.

1229
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,680
Like you do.

1230
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,860
Does it bubble up?

1231
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,700
It's creepy.

1232
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,520
As he's chanting.

1233
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,360
He hasn't gotten in there yet.

1234
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,600
He's still chanting.

1235
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.

1236
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,340
Twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle, twiddle.

1237
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,400
Well done.

1238
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,240
Yeah.

1239
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,060
Thank you.

1240
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,900
You brought out that big bucket of paint and everything.

1241
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,740
Yes.

1242
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,020
And we'll be right back.

1243
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,500
Yeah, Zach's gonna have to clean off

1244
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,740
for the next 30 minutes.

1245
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,100
Just throw some dirt on me.

1246
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,760
He's in the basement?

1247
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,600
He is in the basement.

1248
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,420
Like the lower level?

1249
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,260
Yes.

1250
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,100
Okay.

1251
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,920
So John jumps off the balcony.

1252
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,760
Yeah.

1253
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,600
On to him.

1254
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,420
Awesome.

1255
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,260
And from the way he jumps,

1256
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,100
it looks like he thinks he's like,

1257
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,580
he literally just kind of like steps off.

1258
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,480
All right.

1259
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,100
Roll dexterity or athletics, whichever one's higher.

1260
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,040
65 decks.

1261
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,880
Five.

1262
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,720
What do you do?

1263
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,580
It looks impossible.

1264
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,320
I don't know if you've ever seen being there.

1265
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,120
It's very Chauncey Gardner-ish.

1266
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,920
He literally just like steps off

1267
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,740
and then you just see his feet moving through the air

1268
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,100
like he's walking down steps,

1269
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,060
but very quickly because he's just falling.

1270
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,520
And then perfectly in his stride,

1271
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,840
as he steps the foot forward,

1272
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,860
it like hits, he steps on the naked man's head

1273
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,500
and it breaks his fall.

1274
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,740
And he just glides onto the,

1275
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,620
like walks onto the floor like he meant to do it.

1276
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,460
Hell yeah.

1277
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,740
Your foot comes down on this naked man

1278
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,500
and shoves his head into the bottom of the mop.

1279
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,760
You stand on the other side with literally no paint on you

1280
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,280
and turning back around, you just hear

1281
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,200
doodle doodle doodle, doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle.

1282
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,000
Since he's literally a fish in the bucket,

1283
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,840
can I just put my gun up to his head and kill him?

1284
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,040
Next round.

1285
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,560
I just mean as a casual afterthought to this round.

1286
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,340
Donovan.

1287
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,160
Tell me more.

1288
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,280
What's been going on here?

1289
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,580
I don't know, everything started going really crazy,

1290
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:03,140
but you know, I just, I try to keep to myself

1291
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,860
and you know, I just wanna have a good time at school.

1292
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,740
So I just, you know, just kind of been ignoring all this.

1293
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,860
You've just been going about your normal business.

1294
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,980
I mean, have classes been in session at all?

1295
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,420
I don't go to classes.

1296
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,500
Is that why you're still here?

1297
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,780
I do a lot of online classes.

1298
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,620
Gotcha.

1299
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,060
But I do live on campus.

1300
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:22,900
Okay.

1301
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,720
For fun.

1302
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,560
That's kind of sad.

1303
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,060
But I don't really do much.

1304
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,560
You know, I always thought I was important,

1305
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,440
but maybe not this important.

1306
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,980
Yeah, you weren't.

1307
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,820
Oh.

1308
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,980
From what I can tell.

1309
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,820
Oh, God.

1310
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,040
Roll for sadness.

1311
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,240
I'm sad.

1312
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,520
Kind of unaffected, honestly.

1313
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,560
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

1314
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,720
Donovan's a very like non-emotional human being.

1315
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,960
Well, let's see if this gets you.

1316
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,240
So at the end of this round.

1317
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,120
So wait, is Leon just hanging out with me right now?

1318
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,120
Like protecting me?

1319
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,960
Yeah.

1320
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,380
I'm good with being done talking

1321
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,340
if you just want to watch what's going on here.

1322
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,940
Should we shoot at some of these elves?

1323
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,660
Yeah, I mean, we can if we want.

1324
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,140
Or you could take some pot shots.

1325
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,060
Can you tell me how to aim?

1326
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,300
Like ghost style?

1327
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,380
Yeah, I'll show you how to aim.

1328
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,460
Oh, no.

1329
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,620
Go ahead and roll firearms with a plus 20

1330
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,380
as he puts his hands on over your hands.

1331
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,500
From behind.

1332
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,180
And ghosts your gun.

1333
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,780
And you just can feel him smell you.

1334
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,840
Oh.

1335
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,160
Stop plus 40.

1336
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,640
Crip fail.

1337
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,480
A 99.

1338
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,360
It's not a Crip, but it's.

1339
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,560
Oh, I thought it was a 66.

1340
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,920
Oh, it's a 96.

1341
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,280
Nevermind, just a regular fail.

1342
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,920
Well, if 69 is a Crip success,

1343
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,280
should 96 be a Crip fail?

1344
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,120
Not this time,

1345
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,400
but that would be an interesting house rule to add.

1346
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,240
Let's add it.

1347
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,540
96.

1348
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,380
Fuck, I know I'm gonna be the next person to roll one

1349
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,900
in like two months when I don't fucking remember

1350
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,740
this at all.

1351
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,140
Head to toe, back to back.

1352
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,820
So Leon steps to the side and is like,

1353
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,620
yeah, okay, that was pretty good, but more like this.

1354
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,080
And then he just, he actually looks at you.

1355
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,180
He makes direct eye contact with you while he fires,

1356
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,100
takes one of the elves out and then he turns back.

1357
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,120
No, he continues looking at you and he's like,

1358
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,960
did I get him?

1359
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,400
You're really scary.

1360
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,900
You're a scary guy.

1361
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,940
Yes, I am.

1362
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:33,180
But I am impressed and that almost never happens.

1363
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,020
I'll take it.

1364
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:39,020
So the Santa Claus that is left completely wraps his head

1365
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,900
up in duct tape and then falls to the ground.

1366
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,880
The lady climbing up jumps for the disco ball

1367
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,540
that's in the middle of the room.

1368
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,320
Misses and falls face first into,

1369
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,920
I'm gonna say, let's see, she lands.

1370
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,920
Oh yeah, her crumpled body lands directly

1371
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,320
on the Santa Claus's throne.

1372
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,300
It's like her head landed in the spot where the back

1373
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,880
of your butt is.

1374
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,960
So it like kind of goes into the seat,

1375
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,800
like where you lose change and stuff.

1376
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,280
And the rest of her body just like kind of splits

1377
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,720
and crumbles on the sides around either arm of the chair.

1378
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,900
The three elves, two of which are dead,

1379
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,180
the very, oh no, sorry.

1380
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:29,220
The two elves that are left take off their skates completely

1381
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,660
and slit their own throats with their ice skates.

1382
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:38,660
Blood sprays onto the ice as the elves continue laughing,

1383
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,420
each ha overpowered by the sound of the gurgling.

1384
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,300
And the man in the mop continues to,

1385
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,180
and Clark looking over at the girl throwing the laptop

1386
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,100
up in the air, you see her.

1387
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,180
She's in my arms unconscious.

1388
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,780
You feel her breathe out

1389
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,380
and then not breathe back in.

1390
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,120
Oh, who's around me right now?

1391
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,400
Bad guys, anybody?

1392
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,640
Everyone is dead.

1393
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
I don't think there's necessarily bad guys,

1394
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,040
but the people who cause mental harm.

1395
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,480
We shot them like they were.

1396
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:30,480
I'm the only one trying to pull over.

1397
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Oh, how can you have enough drowning out all alone?

1398
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,100
There's nobody home, no one home, no one home.

1399
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,400
Fly to fly to the stream.
