00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
What's good, people of the internet and the radio waves

00:04.920 --> 00:09.220
and other people that I throw my sounds at on accident

00:09.220 --> 00:12.620
through my vibrations and gyrations.

00:12.620 --> 00:17.280
It's your sound wave sommelier, Wolf the dog.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.280
I'm thrashing about live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:22.960 --> 00:27.960
the most beloved radio station this side of the Milky Way.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.360
Give me a scoop of that space cream.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.360
And now, speaking of you all loving me,

00:34.360 --> 00:37.760
today's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mistress Yachty,

00:37.760 --> 00:41.440
who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.760
Did you know both thumbs are explicitly built

00:44.760 --> 00:48.600
to tweet about this show and tag at Pretending Pod?

00:48.600 --> 00:52.080
Mistress Yachty knows, they write.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.600
Good morrow, Wolfie, how fair ye.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.320
I have stumbled upon a strange box

00:58.320 --> 01:00.520
in the cellar of Duke Arthur,

01:00.520 --> 01:03.680
out of which your lovely voice comes.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.600
Quite strange indeed.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.680
Nonetheless, your so-called cast of broads

01:09.680 --> 01:12.940
is very entertaining while I weave blankets

01:12.940 --> 01:14.480
for the coming winter.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.780
I pray you are not one of the wolves

01:16.780 --> 01:20.320
that come to prey on us in our dark days.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.680
Cordially, Mistress Yachty.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.800
Well, Mistress Yachty, I cannot guarantee

01:26.800 --> 01:31.460
that I won't join some of those feral pups out on a hunt.

01:31.460 --> 01:36.240
It brings me back to my less omniscient days.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.120
But whether or not I devour you this coming winter,

01:40.120 --> 01:43.000
I'm still glad you wrote in to us.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.380
Toodles, Mistress Yachty, for now.

01:46.380 --> 01:49.200
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

01:49.200 --> 01:51.080
be like Mistress Yachty.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.280
Tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.760
tag pretending to be people on Facebook,

01:56.760 --> 02:00.520
or write a five-star review on your podcast app of choice

02:00.520 --> 02:02.200
and holler about it.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.240
Wanna see what Luke looks like?

02:04.240 --> 02:06.480
Check out our social meds.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.440
Wanna interact with other listeners and Luke?

02:09.440 --> 02:10.960
Check out the subreddit.

02:10.960 --> 02:15.160
Wanna join a thriving community of absolute fucking freaks?

02:15.160 --> 02:16.880
Check out the Discord.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.200
Wanna listen to Wave's sick soundtrack for this show?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.720
Check out the damn YouTubes.

02:23.720 --> 02:28.720
And you want a PTBP shirt or hat or towel or fanny pack?

02:29.320 --> 02:31.120
Check out the merch store.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.320
And you wanna know where to find all those links?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.720
Say it with me, no matter where you are.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.600
The links are in the show notes.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.680
And if anyone asks why you just said that out loud

02:45.680 --> 02:50.680
to no one in particular, tell them it's time for the news.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.920
Last time, the can crew was arrested

02:54.920 --> 02:58.600
for the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge,

02:58.600 --> 03:00.560
Sandro the Turtle.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.840
With the trial in the gang's immediate future,

03:03.840 --> 03:06.600
Vernon Covington, the landlord,

03:06.600 --> 03:09.560
led the cuffed crew to the It Pit,

03:09.560 --> 03:13.640
a horrible underground holding cell filled with a few inches

03:13.640 --> 03:18.640
of bodily fluid mud and a specifically strange symbol

03:18.640 --> 03:22.840
scrawled ceaselessly on its dimly lit walls.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.360
As Vernon Covington pushed the party

03:25.360 --> 03:28.120
through the open metal cellar doors,

03:28.120 --> 03:32.360
Cal Colorado was able to pull the landlord along

03:32.360 --> 03:34.840
down into the awful mess.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.480
There, the city action news team attacked,

03:38.480 --> 03:43.480
leaving their foe face down and still in the yucky yuck.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.400
Of the It Pit.

03:45.400 --> 03:49.240
Taking us now to that terrible scene.

03:49.240 --> 03:54.240
It's Altagirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.800
And it's all my fault

03:58.800 --> 04:03.800
Cause my life is great

04:03.800 --> 04:05.800
And it's all mine

04:05.800 --> 04:10.800
Cause my life is great

04:10.800 --> 04:15.800
And it's all my fault

04:35.800 --> 04:40.800
I love being in all the blood and cum.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.360
So you guys have had a week to look over this symbol.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.560
What do you make of it?

05:00.560 --> 05:05.560
It looks like whoever drew it talks like this

05:06.560 --> 05:08.200
and needs serious help.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.120
This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.160
I was just going through some like old notebooks

05:16.160 --> 05:17.920
from when I was a kid and came across this

05:17.920 --> 05:19.480
and was like season two, baby.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.680
That would be a great like a tagline for this podcast.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.720
Made by her.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.520
This came out of the mind of a very disturbed child.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.480
I might've turned 30 this year, but I take it.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.480
You're still a baby.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.200
That's why I make a pretend to be people with my friends.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.720
Like Thomas.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.720
Thomas loves you when I talk like this.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.520
Zach, I don't, but I love you.

05:47.520 --> 05:52.520
Today at work I had to write an email

05:58.360 --> 06:00.400
that was all about rum

06:00.400 --> 06:04.600
and I just couldn't stop making cum jokes.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.120
And everyone clapped.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.080
It's crazy.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.520
They all stood up and cheered for me.

06:12.520 --> 06:16.000
They chanted, cum, cum, cum, cum.

06:16.040 --> 06:19.480
I had some of the copy that I wasn't gonna put in there

06:19.480 --> 06:21.520
was young, dumb and full of rum.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.600
And she's like, that is so gross.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.920
What about like rum in my mouth?

06:25.920 --> 06:27.080
Yeah, that's actually good.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.040
Rum in my mouth is also great.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.760
I thought you meant like you made a movie poster

06:31.760 --> 06:33.640
for the cum diary.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.040
Nice.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.640
Yeah, I really thought you were switching rum to cum.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.160
Cum with rum, which is a little cheekier.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.840
Cum tug tugger.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.680
There's something there.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.600
Yeah, cum.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.920
It's cumbling outside, like rumbling.

06:52.840 --> 06:53.960
Okay, let's play.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.800
Classic.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.720
That's how it's pretending to be people.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.320
The vape hit in the background.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.920
I was gonna point out on this symbol

07:01.920 --> 07:04.120
that you mentioned that this was a hammer.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.760
I think that could also be like a lectern

07:07.760 --> 07:09.000
or like a music stadium.

07:09.000 --> 07:09.840
I like that, yeah.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.840
But it could be a hammer too,

07:10.840 --> 07:12.640
especially with the square up there.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.920
It just looked more like that than an upside down cross,

07:14.920 --> 07:15.760
which is literally one of the examples.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.120
Or if you zoom in, it's a basketball goal.

07:19.120 --> 07:19.960
Yeah.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.800
Because there's a little hoop.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.480
I don't think there's any use in trying

07:22.480 --> 07:27.120
to put any meaning into this fucking stupid scribblings.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.200
I like to think the episode starts with the four,

07:29.200 --> 07:30.720
no, you said stupid scribblings.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.720
I like the episode starting with the four of you.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.040
That's not the part I don't say about.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.440
Just standing, like the episode starts with the four

07:37.440 --> 07:41.200
of you just standing there, staring at the wall.

07:41.240 --> 07:44.440
Beck, do you think it looks a little bit

07:44.440 --> 07:46.480
like a basketball goal?

07:46.480 --> 07:48.160
Ah, yeah, dude.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.960
I like to think of it as a hammer.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.680
It could be also like a music stand

07:52.680 --> 07:54.560
or like, I don't know, man.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.560
I think we almost killed a guy just a second ago.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, I enjoy looking at shapes and clouds,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.840
but this is neither the time nor place.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.800
Like I was seeing red for a second there, guys.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.240
I'm sorry I lost my cool dudes.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.480
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

08:09.480 --> 08:14.000
I went somewhere else when I got in this pit.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.720
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.800
Where did you go?

08:16.800 --> 08:18.160
In my mine palace.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.480
Oh, what's that?

08:19.480 --> 08:20.520
Don't you have one?

08:20.520 --> 08:23.080
Mine's a tree house in the woods.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.760
I have a real palace, but I mean,

08:25.760 --> 08:27.920
it's just like a big house, I guess, like an estate,

08:27.920 --> 08:29.960
but you have one in your mind?

08:29.960 --> 08:33.520
Do you know how to get out of the pit?

08:33.520 --> 08:36.280
She looks up and one of the doors is open

08:36.280 --> 08:41.040
and she's like, well, they do normally keep that shut.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.200
So there's potential here.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.080
I sort of have an idea about that.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.000
Okay.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.480
We need to get them here, at least in my plan.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.800
We should probably vote on it, talk it over.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.240
I was thinking I got that clicker

08:56.240 --> 08:58.680
that opens all the windows in that place.

08:58.680 --> 09:01.480
Is there a clicker for these handcuffs?

09:01.480 --> 09:04.280
Well, we should probably search this corpse, right?

09:04.280 --> 09:05.320
Not corpse, but-

09:05.320 --> 09:06.360
Almost lifeless body.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.680
But this shell, yeah.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.240
This shell of a human.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.720
Yeah, and because Julius Summers

09:11.720 --> 09:13.160
has his hands in front of him,

09:13.160 --> 09:18.160
he's pretty easily able to go through and find a key

09:18.200 --> 09:20.960
to unlock all of your handcuffs.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.480
I use it.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.680
Thank you, Julius, for setting us free.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.440
Now here's my proposition.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.760
Oh, that feels so much better.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.840
Okay, yeah, what's up?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.600
Stevie, we'll need your blessing for this,

09:31.640 --> 09:35.600
but what if we just scream and yell for help?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.240
Say he attacked us

09:37.240 --> 09:40.800
and tried to put Faith Godel in the it pit.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.800
Yeah, I mean, I don't wanna be stoned to death, so-

09:46.160 --> 09:50.400
Would you not be hailed as a leader of the people?

09:50.400 --> 09:51.220
I was gonna mention,

09:51.220 --> 09:53.440
it seemed like you even had maybe a vendetta

09:53.440 --> 09:54.360
against this guy.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.560
There may be like other people who feel that way,

09:56.560 --> 09:58.200
and this is gonna be like a,

09:58.280 --> 10:01.440
hail Godel, the wicked landlord is dead situation.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.160
Whoa, I didn't even think of-

10:05.160 --> 10:08.120
Yes, a Godel come back to the people to save them

10:08.120 --> 10:11.040
from the grip of the horrid landlord.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.360
Okay, but I've been missing for a year.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.040
Does that mean that they would assume

10:15.040 --> 10:16.920
that I was down here the whole time?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.720
We could use that?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.520
I don't think so.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.520
Everyone saw you.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.520
Oh, right, duh.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.280
Oh, shit, yeah, that's my bad.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.640
That's true, Cal, yeah.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.480
I think we-

10:26.600 --> 10:27.440
I swear.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.680
Wait, no, but they saw Stevie.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.440
They didn't see Faith.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.440
The problem is you look very similar.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.280
Wait, hang on, like let your hair down.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.400
Let's see if like you're a totally different person.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.360
Yeah, take your glasses off.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.920
Boing, boing, boing, boing.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.320
Classic 90s rom-com.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.160
Julius, put your boner away.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.120
Now that his hands are free, he does.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.520
Yeah, his pants got ripped open in a fight,

10:54.520 --> 10:55.680
so he tucks it back in.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.680
How far down did we fall into this pit?

10:59.680 --> 11:02.760
That's a great, I was wondering that the whole time.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.880
Is this like just deep enough

11:04.880 --> 11:07.760
that we couldn't quite reach the top or?

11:07.760 --> 11:09.760
No, I think it's 10 feet.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.680
Oh, we could just-

11:10.680 --> 11:11.520
We can just climb out.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.360
Force ourselves out.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.960
We need no subterfuge.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.400
I've got the strongest base.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.240
You guys could just hop off my shoulders.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.080
That's true, you're like a mighty tripod.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.120
Or do you wanna like continue with your plan though

11:26.640 --> 11:28.880
and like it makes it look like we're like hapless

11:28.880 --> 11:30.760
and don't wanna be.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.320
Oh, I think it's still a good idea,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.320
but it wouldn't be necessary for our escape.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.680
Right, I'm saying like should we wait in this hole

11:37.680 --> 11:39.280
for people to see us in this hole

11:39.280 --> 11:41.800
and that we didn't like run away when they-

11:41.800 --> 11:43.160
Oh yes, and then in that case,

11:43.160 --> 11:44.440
we should scream and call for help

11:44.440 --> 11:45.920
because I don't want to wait in this hole

11:45.920 --> 11:47.120
any longer than I have to.

11:47.120 --> 11:51.560
Just a counter argument, what if they don't care?

11:51.560 --> 11:54.040
That is, I mean, yeah, that's kind of in Stevie's court.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.840
Like how do you think this plan works?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.800
On like a scale of one to 10?

11:58.800 --> 12:01.520
Yeah, I'd call it a coin flip, honestly.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.200
The alternative is they come back

12:03.200 --> 12:05.520
and find us with our jailer.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.720
Right, they're gonna see us like this either way.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.920
I think we need a good cover story.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.680
On a scale from one to 10, a coin flip is a five, just-

12:12.680 --> 12:14.720
That's good to know for the future.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.960
I don't like Zach's dick.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.400
Do I have like, do I have my phone on me?

12:19.400 --> 12:20.240
Yeah.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.040
While we're just like talking about this,

12:23.040 --> 12:25.160
Julius gets his phone out and turns the flashlight on

12:25.320 --> 12:27.480
and looks at what's actually down here

12:27.480 --> 12:29.120
that we couldn't see before.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.440
How big a room are we in?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.640
Do you want it in meters or yards?

12:35.920 --> 12:38.160
How many of my arm spans would it take

12:38.160 --> 12:39.480
to hit the next wall?

12:39.480 --> 12:42.780
Oh, probably like 10.

12:42.780 --> 12:43.620
Holy shit.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.320
Yeah, like 20 yards by 20 yards-ish.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.560
How many Volvos could you fit in this bag, boy?

12:47.560 --> 12:48.400
Oh.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.220
Like the station wagon.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.760
Probably four.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.020
Yeah, easily six, probably six, yeah.

12:55.020 --> 12:57.700
Like all standing, like car edge style.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.540
Car nose down.

12:58.540 --> 12:59.940
Like car sardines, yeah.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.140
Yeah, you could really shove more in there, huh?

13:03.660 --> 13:06.300
After Julius kinda like flashes his flashlight

13:06.300 --> 13:09.980
around a little bit, he is kind of like pushing Cal

13:09.980 --> 13:13.540
to stand in front of one of these symbols

13:13.540 --> 13:17.100
and he like flips over to TikTok.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.660
Cal, do you wanna just,

13:22.700 --> 13:24.700
I could just get like a still image

13:24.700 --> 13:26.220
to put in the TikTok later

13:26.220 --> 13:29.360
or do you wanna describe anything?

13:29.360 --> 13:33.980
No, and Cal like leans down to help lift Stevie Gotel's foot

13:33.980 --> 13:34.860
up over the pit.

13:34.860 --> 13:37.900
I get that with the symbol in the background.

13:39.420 --> 13:40.740
I know we're in like viscera,

13:40.740 --> 13:44.220
but is there any remains that are more intact around here?

13:44.220 --> 13:45.900
Is there anybody else in here?

13:45.900 --> 13:48.720
Is this a pit that's been holding other prisoners?

13:48.720 --> 13:50.860
So there's like 40 other, no.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.420
There's no one else down here.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.440
They were all cheering wildly.

13:55.540 --> 13:59.340
Priti Press, Priti Press, Priti Press.

14:02.260 --> 14:03.420
Oh, hey guys.

14:03.420 --> 14:04.800
No, there's no one else down here.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.500
And really with the viscera,

14:06.500 --> 14:11.020
it's more of a leftovers kind of situation down here.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.220
Great show, great show.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.860
Just a lot of hot shirtless dudes on the cover

14:16.980 --> 14:18.700
of down here, what?

14:18.700 --> 14:20.740
You never watched the leftovers, did you?

14:21.860 --> 14:23.300
Oh, I'm thinking of left behind.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.060
Nick Cage right there on the front.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.880
Nope, I didn't.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.620
There's like, there's no-

14:31.620 --> 14:32.460
Well, you nailed it.

14:32.460 --> 14:33.620
It's hot shirtless dudes.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.180
God's jealous.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.580
He left them all behind.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.420
You guys are looking around

14:43.420 --> 14:48.420
and there are no like intact human bodies down here,

14:48.460 --> 14:53.460
but there are seemingly pieces of body parts down here.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.300
And as you pick through, you also,

14:57.300 --> 14:58.140
I mean, if you're,

14:58.140 --> 15:00.620
are you like picking through at this point or?

15:00.620 --> 15:04.020
No, I was kind of looking for bodies that had clothing

15:04.020 --> 15:07.700
and doing a like red or a yellow versus green kind of thing.

15:07.700 --> 15:08.660
Oh, okay, yeah, cool.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.120
Everybody roll search.

15:15.220 --> 15:16.740
40 on a 70, pass.

15:16.740 --> 15:19.820
I pass my search with a 26 on a 40.

15:19.820 --> 15:20.660
Cool.

15:20.660 --> 15:21.780
Cal passes with a nine.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.180
Three passes.

15:23.180 --> 15:24.920
Three pieces of information.

15:26.740 --> 15:27.580
One.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.660
Oh, we can't just make them up.

15:30.660 --> 15:31.500
Julius.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.020
Yeah, you each write down three things

15:34.020 --> 15:36.820
and we'll decide which of the six are the best.

15:36.820 --> 15:37.660
Yeah.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.860
Yeah, so as Julius is like,

15:38.860 --> 15:42.020
basically just like getting a full TikTok film

15:42.020 --> 15:45.520
of what's all in here and then he stumbles on.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.000
It's like a ear.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.180
It's like a weird,

15:49.320 --> 15:54.040
it's like a, oh, it's not a human ear though.

15:54.040 --> 15:59.040
And it seems to have fur on the outside of it.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.440
That doesn't quite narrow it down.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.720
Does it, it's human ear shaped?

16:04.720 --> 16:09.720
No, it is shaped like a dog or a wolf's ear

16:09.860 --> 16:13.760
and it has been severed from the head that it was on

16:13.760 --> 16:17.200
and it's kind of sticking out from within this

16:17.200 --> 16:21.360
just layer of disgusting gloop that's down here.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.360
And Beck Wilder, as you're going through,

16:24.360 --> 16:27.560
just kind of looking around with your cell phone light,

16:27.560 --> 16:28.380
you see that.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.880
Or maybe the light on his camera

16:29.880 --> 16:32.160
that he's whipped out at this point.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.000
They took the camera away from him?

16:33.000 --> 16:33.840
They took the camera away from him.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.660
Oh no.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.500
Remember they put it in a bag.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.340
It's the worst anyway.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.160
Right, in my mind the bag was on his back for some reason.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.440
The camera bag was in Vernon Covington's possession

16:44.080 --> 16:46.200
and so it is just right above you.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.040
Outside of.

16:47.040 --> 16:47.880
Like he set it down outside the doors.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.400
He set it down outside the stores that he came down.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.440
Fucked with some prisoners.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.600
Oh, okay.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.840
So it's just right up there.

16:53.840 --> 16:54.680
I'm glad that.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.520
You can smell it, Beck.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.640
Fucker is, he's not quite dead.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.600
Mostly dead.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.560
Yeah, we'll see.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, we just left him face down in this muck, right?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.280
Face up, but pretty rough.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.600
Face up in the muck.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.120
I turn him face down.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.880
He says nothing at all.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.640
He's almost dead.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.960
He can't even freaking talk.

17:17.040 --> 17:17.880
One day.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.880
Little red jumpsuit apparatus just for Thomas.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.760
And so you see Beck Wilder,

17:24.760 --> 17:29.560
a piece of cloth actually sticking up out of the muck here.

17:29.560 --> 17:34.560
And as you grab it, it seems to be some sort of like,

17:35.980 --> 17:38.400
yeah, it's a jumpsuit and it's.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.240
Is it red?

17:39.240 --> 17:40.080
It's red.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.400
Monochromatic.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.080
Oh, holy shit.

17:43.080 --> 17:43.920
Damn.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.960
Your brain just made a connection on accident.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.160
I wish, but it's not.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.720
It is a monochromatic jumpsuit.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.560
We went over this.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.480
It's a gray scale jumpsuit, but.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.720
Also not quite the word, but better.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.600
It's almost a gray scale jumpsuit.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.200
It's a gray jumpsuit with a color like a stripe.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.160
Purple.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.600
Oh shit, it's purple.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.920
A third color.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.760
And anyone.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.560
Cal vomits like in suspense.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.800
Anyone who's either one of you.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.760
I got it in my notes.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.600
The purple Jackalope, purple ribbon Jackalope Fox

18:24.600 --> 18:26.960
removed it from that Jackalope and walked away.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.860
We weren't supposed to see the purple ribbon.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.400
Dang straight.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.040
That Jackalope was supposed to die in this pit.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.160
Hey dude, you remember that second Jackalope we saw?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.360
It had a purple ribbon just like this.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.040
And that Fox dude like took it off.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.840
He was condemned to death,

18:45.840 --> 18:48.280
perhaps for killing a frog comptroller.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.600
That was a joke.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.240
That was good.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.000
Thank you, Stevie.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.600
Yeah, that was solid.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.760
Stevie, what does the purple mean?

19:07.760 --> 19:10.840
This is where they kept,

19:10.840 --> 19:14.080
I guess they kept, I was expecting this place to be full.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.160
This is where they kept the twenties.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.560
The twenties?

19:18.560 --> 19:19.760
Yeah, it's what they call them.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.040
But yeah, everyone just kind of referred to them

19:23.040 --> 19:24.800
as the twenties.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.120
Did they have...

19:26.120 --> 19:26.960
Meaning what?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.240
Furry ears?

19:28.240 --> 19:33.240
No, I have absolutely no idea what that's about.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.880
That's really strange.

19:34.880 --> 19:39.880
And as she says that, Cal, you find the matching ear.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.600
So it's like the other ear from the one that Julius found.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.400
And do any of you have like biology, any science,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.560
any animal knowledge?

19:49.560 --> 19:53.360
If not, I'll take a intelligence at like a negative 20.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.320
I'll try that.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.160
I'll try that too.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.720
Cal holds the ear up close to his face

19:57.720 --> 20:02.020
and peers into it for some whisper of its secrets.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.000
And fails.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.800
He drops the ear back into the book.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.080
You said a negative 20?

20:08.080 --> 20:08.920
Yeah.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.040
That's a 49 on what would be a 50.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.880
Nice.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.160
I got a 91, so I don't win.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.960
So they're holding up these things

20:15.960 --> 20:17.160
and you walk up with the...

20:17.160 --> 20:18.640
I hold the ribbon between them.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.880
Uh-huh.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.240
You like pop up your head in between them

20:22.240 --> 20:23.480
and put them on either side of you.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.640
And yeah, when Beck pops up his head,

20:27.040 --> 20:31.000
it's very clear that, yeah, it seems to...

20:31.000 --> 20:34.700
It's like fox ears, but they're bigger.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.500
Yeah, like they are the ears of a fox,

20:38.940 --> 20:41.220
but it would be a massive fox.

20:41.220 --> 20:43.220
So you're just really leaning in

20:43.220 --> 20:45.400
for the furry demographic this season.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.320
Always have been.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.020
We got fox people, folks.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.100
It's dead.

20:52.100 --> 20:52.940
Oh, duh.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.540
Yeah, that's why we have its ears.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.460
Okay, actually, because all three of you

20:59.460 --> 21:01.180
succeeded on your rolls,

21:01.180 --> 21:03.140
I'm gonna go ahead and give you one final thing.

21:03.140 --> 21:06.180
So Cal, yeah, right?

21:06.180 --> 21:08.420
Yeah, a little extra, yeah.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.660
Because I thought of something.

21:12.660 --> 21:17.660
Cal, with the detached fox ear in one hand,

21:18.740 --> 21:19.860
as you pulled it out,

21:19.860 --> 21:23.820
you see that there's actually a small piece of paper

21:23.820 --> 21:25.540
sticking up out of this muck

21:25.540 --> 21:28.040
where it had clearly been buried

21:28.040 --> 21:29.540
and you might not have even found it

21:29.540 --> 21:32.580
if you hadn't gotten the second ear,

21:32.580 --> 21:35.620
but underneath you see this little bit

21:35.620 --> 21:37.060
of paper sticking out.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.220
Guys, look, paper.

21:39.220 --> 21:41.620
I look to see what's on the paper.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.460
No, you don't.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.540
I'm standing right over it.

21:44.860 --> 21:46.100
I just called your attention to it.

21:46.100 --> 21:46.920
Yeah.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.760
Shut the fuck up.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.780
This is my paper.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.540
I'm looking at it.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.860
From across the room, Julius stares.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.000
I dive for the paper.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.580
I kick back in the jaw.

22:03.700 --> 22:04.780
I read the paper.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.940
Yeah, as you pick it up,

22:07.780 --> 22:10.060
you're gonna have to kind of get some of the muck

22:10.060 --> 22:12.180
and gunk off of it.

22:12.180 --> 22:13.000
Julius, come here.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.460
Read this nasty paper for me.

22:15.980 --> 22:18.900
Yeah, I go over and I try to read it

22:18.900 --> 22:20.520
after I scraped some muck off.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.260
It's like a small business card

22:22.260 --> 22:25.460
in the shape of a big guitar pick.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.860
And it says the occult

22:27.860 --> 22:32.020
and unnatural investigative journalism association.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.780
Shout out to Intrepid T over on Discord,

22:35.780 --> 22:38.420
one of our $10 and up patrons

22:38.420 --> 22:41.100
over at patreon.com slash pretending pod

22:41.100 --> 22:43.340
for giving us the occult

22:43.340 --> 22:47.020
and unnatural investigative journalism association.

22:47.020 --> 22:47.860
Dope.

22:47.860 --> 22:48.840
What do you think about that, Cal?

22:48.840 --> 22:50.440
Ouija.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.280
What?

22:51.280 --> 22:52.480
Ouija.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.360
O-U-I-J-A.

22:55.300 --> 22:57.700
No, that obviously spells Ouija.

22:57.700 --> 22:58.540
Oh, yeah.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.060
It can't be Ouija.

23:01.060 --> 23:02.740
Before I put it together in my head,

23:02.740 --> 23:04.380
I was like, oh, it doesn't mean anything.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.220
So it'd be funny to say like,

23:05.580 --> 23:06.420
Ouija.

23:06.420 --> 23:07.240
O-U-I-J-A.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.080
O-U-I-J-A.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.020
And I'm like, wait.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.820
Do you think that Intrepid T

23:11.820 --> 23:14.140
knew what they were doing when they wrote this?

23:14.140 --> 23:14.960
Nope.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.800
One of our listeners.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.640
He looked into that.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.100
Yeah, undoubtedly not.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.940
A Bob Ross situation.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.300
It's so wild he picked out that collection of words.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.340
Did he even know?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.940
Oh shit, this is not my, this campaign note.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.700
This is our original campaign notebook full of notes.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.440
What's it say?

23:33.440 --> 23:35.520
That page wasn't very interesting.

23:35.520 --> 23:39.000
Yeah, before we recorded, it was all pretty boring.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.680
We went to a green box.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.520
Nice.

23:41.520 --> 23:43.320
Bright light and immense noise.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.320
The dust begins to crawl, then fly.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.920
The cave is full of lice.

23:51.660 --> 23:55.160
The cave is full of lice is fucking horrifying sentence.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.000
It is.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.680
What, have you ever heard of this cow, Peck?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.080
Well, I mean, it's, you know,

24:01.080 --> 24:03.520
a well-known band of kooks, of course.

24:03.520 --> 24:08.020
They investigate Bigfoot and other nonsense.

24:08.020 --> 24:10.160
They think the moon landing never happened.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.080
I mean, but do we like have proof, you know?

24:13.080 --> 24:14.300
Like, did you see it?

24:14.300 --> 24:15.140
Yes.

24:18.320 --> 24:21.960
A nice moment of levity in a horrifying dark room

24:21.960 --> 24:24.560
of terror and smelly nonsense.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.480
So like, it's crazy that I'm here

24:28.480 --> 24:29.840
to answer all these questions,

24:29.840 --> 24:32.440
but the 20s are what we called them

24:32.440 --> 24:37.440
because it was roughly, you know how Greg got got?

24:37.900 --> 24:39.520
He was Greg and now he's Fox.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.160
Right, by the mind control.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.280
Yeah, it's kind of like mind control.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.880
But basically when he does it,

24:49.080 --> 24:53.080
there's probably like a 20% chance that it just,

24:53.080 --> 24:56.020
and she points at the walls around you.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.100
It just kind of does this to you.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.100
It makes you a role-playing podcaster

25:00.100 --> 25:01.340
with the mind of a child.

25:04.940 --> 25:07.060
Essentially, yeah.

25:07.060 --> 25:09.360
Yeah, I mean, you just talk and talk and talk,

25:09.360 --> 25:11.800
but nothing of substance ever really comes out,

25:11.800 --> 25:15.340
just yammering on and on about some tower,

25:15.340 --> 25:17.420
getting God back to heaven.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.420
It's just, they just talk and talk.

25:19.420 --> 25:22.460
Is there any left?

25:22.460 --> 25:25.660
I mean, I thought that we were gonna be surrounded.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.940
I was ready for a different kind of fight, honestly,

25:28.760 --> 25:29.600
when we got down here.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.940
Don't worry, in a very real way, they're still with us.

25:30.940 --> 25:32.100
Let's get out of this pit.

25:32.100 --> 25:32.940
Yeah.

25:32.940 --> 25:35.360
Yeah, my camera's up there, dude.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.960
We're the fucking can news crew, guys.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.200
Let's go get our camera.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.080
Julius puts his back up against the wall near the hole

25:43.080 --> 25:47.700
and puts his hands down, ready to lift people up and out.

25:47.700 --> 25:52.700
Okay, we're gonna need a strength check on both accounts.

25:52.700 --> 25:57.700
Each time, I'm gonna make sure Luke passes his

25:58.660 --> 26:00.780
before you have a good shot at yours.

26:00.780 --> 26:02.020
Fail on the first one.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.060
29 out of 50, pass on the second one.

26:09.140 --> 26:11.860
Should he get a plus 20 since he's lifting with his legs?

26:11.860 --> 26:13.140
Fail on the third one.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.660
And also, great question.

26:15.660 --> 26:16.980
Well, what we're gonna do here-

26:16.980 --> 26:20.700
Also, both my fails would have still failed with 20 more.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.420
I meant plus 30.

26:23.420 --> 26:27.860
Yes, both my fails would have still failed with a plus 30.

26:27.860 --> 26:30.160
I got 90s and 80s.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.860
Because you guys have time, not a ton of time,

26:32.860 --> 26:37.420
but you do have time, whoever is last is gonna be the one

26:37.420 --> 26:40.020
who might get stuck, and that's gonna be

26:40.020 --> 26:42.580
the difficult place to be in.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.740
I mean, it would be me, right?

26:44.740 --> 26:47.740
If you were the one lifting everyone up out,

26:47.740 --> 26:48.860
like helping everyone up out,

26:48.860 --> 26:50.300
then you would be the last one

26:50.300 --> 26:52.940
that they're gonna try to pull you up.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.260
I think that's the plan, though.

26:54.260 --> 26:58.420
So, with enough time, only 10 feet up, a wall behind you,

26:58.420 --> 27:03.140
you're easily able to get Beck, Cal, and Stevie

27:03.140 --> 27:05.420
up out of the it pit.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.340
They're all three looking down at you

27:07.340 --> 27:12.340
in this vile, disgusting, absolutely wretched,

27:12.980 --> 27:15.660
like it's hard not to throw up while you're still down.

27:15.660 --> 27:16.860
And we just walk away.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.220
You can't get used to it.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.860
To get a little higher up, I would like to sit Vernon

27:22.860 --> 27:25.260
up against the wall and stand on his shoulders

27:25.260 --> 27:28.100
to have a couple more feet closer to the wall.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.500
That's fucking role playing.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.600
That is Liam Neeson, Ra's al Ghuling,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.140
being aware of your surroundings,

27:34.140 --> 27:37.180
and that will get you out of here without rolling.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.020
Hell yeah.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.780
But we probably need to try to roll.

27:39.780 --> 27:41.660
Should we roll to retrieve him?

27:41.660 --> 27:45.620
That is gonna be a difficult retrieval, I believe.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.460
Fucking leave him in there.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.500
I think we should leave him.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.380
I think this is the best place for him right now.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.300
He's far away to where when he screams,

27:52.300 --> 27:53.700
nobody might hear him,

27:53.700 --> 27:55.180
because we're gonna shut the door behind us, for sure.

27:55.180 --> 27:59.540
Well, we are, but also back to the potential plan.

27:59.540 --> 28:02.580
Should we run screaming into the town now,

28:02.580 --> 28:04.100
saying help, help, help.

28:04.100 --> 28:07.780
As opposed to what's sneaking out of here, I guess.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.940
Or casually strolling in and saying,

28:09.940 --> 28:13.060
we kicked that guy's ass, fuck you.

28:13.060 --> 28:15.980
The former does seem like the better,

28:15.980 --> 28:18.300
if those are the only two choices.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.860
I don't like to fool the public.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.700
In fact, it's my stated mission to never do it.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.420
But our very lives depend on it,

28:24.420 --> 28:26.820
and so does the information we carry in our minds now,

28:26.820 --> 28:28.600
and on Beck's precious camera.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.220
Oh, as Beck just caresses.

28:31.220 --> 28:33.620
Oh yeah, it's out of the bag and back to filming.

28:33.620 --> 28:36.580
What if instead of either of those,

28:36.580 --> 28:41.480
remember we were invited to a certain someone's GIZ?

28:41.480 --> 28:42.580
Greg?

28:42.580 --> 28:45.200
Do you think we could just go to Greg's

28:45.240 --> 28:47.480
and see if we can't get some help?

28:47.480 --> 28:49.960
I mean, he probably wouldn't know

28:49.960 --> 28:51.920
what was happening with us.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.240
If he's just at his house,

28:53.240 --> 28:54.980
he hasn't been paying attention to anything,

28:54.980 --> 28:58.440
so he wouldn't even know that we're heading to trial,

28:58.440 --> 29:00.960
and she looks at her phone, and she's like,

29:00.960 --> 29:02.320
in like half an hour.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.280
Did we ever ask if we have cell phone reception?

29:04.280 --> 29:06.720
I'm not sure if you did ask, but I do have to pee.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.440
What if this whole fucking time

29:09.440 --> 29:11.200
we could have just called 911?

29:11.200 --> 29:14.560
I feel like we did, but I don't wanna say that we did,

29:14.560 --> 29:16.580
in case he thinks maybe we can.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.520
We've had fucking five bars this whole time.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.600
We're getting texts from like, where are you?

29:24.600 --> 29:26.560
I'm using my flashlight,

29:26.560 --> 29:29.080
just like not looking at anything else on the screen.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.040
Your battery is draining to nothing.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.280
I'm gonna go with a solid, there's no way, but.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.560
We wouldn't have had a reason to

29:37.560 --> 29:39.040
up until we got sentenced to death,

29:39.040 --> 29:41.840
so right now exploring that option is probably.

29:41.840 --> 29:44.040
The giant statues are just cell towers.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.360
That fucking 5G.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.500
Turning everybody into freaking werefoxes.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.880
Zach, I remember the thing that I thought of

29:52.880 --> 29:54.680
that was maybe important, and then I forgot.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.920
It was pretty important.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.280
I hit a breaking point.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.480
Oh, I had a question too for you.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.160
Yeah, right when we got down in there, huh?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.740
We'll do a breaking point for you now.

30:03.740 --> 30:04.660
What was your question?

30:04.660 --> 30:07.120
I was looking on my phone to see

30:07.120 --> 30:10.280
what I wrote down as my phobia or whatever.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.480
This is what I had.

30:11.480 --> 30:15.720
I literally, Julia Summers, phobia.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.480
Big pits of blood, flesh, and shit.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.600
And then I looked to see if I had a different note,

30:20.600 --> 30:25.160
and the next one was grip colon in a different note,

30:25.160 --> 30:26.840
and I just never wrote it down.

30:26.840 --> 30:29.240
With no number, amazing.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.880
But I knew it was something to do with that,

30:30.880 --> 30:32.180
and that makes sense.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.020
Good to go.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.280
It's from July 5th.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.120
Grip.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.000
Oh.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.120
Grip.

30:42.120 --> 30:42.940
Grip.

30:42.940 --> 30:43.780
Okay, cool.

30:43.780 --> 30:45.320
Well, let's have Luke and Thomas

30:45.320 --> 30:46.780
take off your headphones real quick,

30:46.780 --> 30:48.320
and Joe, let's.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.440
Forget how we're doing it this season.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.760
This season, we're just kinda deciding

30:51.760 --> 30:52.680
what it's gonna be.

30:52.680 --> 30:53.680
Oh, good, cool.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.220
Between the two of us.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.880
Well then, I've got a few options.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.160
Yeah, hit me with them.

30:59.160 --> 31:02.600
Just viscera and gore and gross gore.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.440
Gross gore.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.640
Like beyond just blood.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.560
Yeah.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.680
Or crazy designs.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.160
I like, I.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.360
Joe, the player, loves investigating crazy designs.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.200
Yeah.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.020
Yeah.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.760
Or if you got something else.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.240
Yeah, yeah.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.440
I think that.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.520
It was literally the fight response

31:23.520 --> 31:25.640
was what made me, my sanity broke,

31:25.640 --> 31:27.320
and I had a fight response,

31:27.320 --> 31:28.820
if you want it to be fight related.

31:28.820 --> 31:29.660
Okay, yeah, yeah.

31:29.660 --> 31:31.140
It was the least likely thing I had put.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.240
I rolled a one to get it.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.200
Okay, yeah.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.040
What about?

31:35.640 --> 31:38.320
What about like men wearing suits?

31:38.320 --> 31:39.640
Oh, because of the landlord, you mean?

31:39.640 --> 31:40.480
Yeah.

31:40.480 --> 31:41.300
Oh, yeah.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.560
Or like, I guess that's a little strange,

31:43.560 --> 31:44.400
maybe, I don't know.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.480
Or heights, you could also do heights.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.320
Like falling?

31:47.320 --> 31:48.140
Yeah.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.320
But I like either of the first two

31:50.320 --> 31:52.760
that you came up with, so I'll.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.360
I like the ones you said, though.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.300
I mean.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.140
I'll defer to you.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.240
I'm between the heights, the suit,

32:00.240 --> 32:02.400
and the blood, because I don't.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree with you.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.760
Every time we look at this diagram,

32:05.760 --> 32:06.880
if we ever look at it again.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.340
We'll all cut out heights.

32:08.340 --> 32:10.920
Okay, so suits or viscera?

32:10.920 --> 32:12.560
I mean, let's just roll for it,

32:12.560 --> 32:13.640
because either one.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.480
Yeah.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.160
One, two, three is blood.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.020
Four, five, six is the other one.

32:19.900 --> 32:20.740
It's a four.

32:20.740 --> 32:22.160
Okay, so men in suits.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.260
Men wearing suits.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.020
I mean, that's great.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.200
That's good for Beck as a character.

32:27.200 --> 32:32.200
I will say, as soon as we have decided that,

32:32.520 --> 32:33.760
you're gonna need to.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.560
Am I gonna have to fight every person in a suit?

32:35.560 --> 32:39.080
Well, you're gonna need to work on maybe Julius and Kal.

32:39.080 --> 32:39.920
Oh, fuck.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.840
I forgot I was surrounded by men in suits.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.480
Yeah, they both wear those,

32:46.480 --> 32:49.280
and so does everyone you work with.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.920
I was picturing just running into maybe some of the Godels.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.320
Nope, it's everybody around me.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.160
Ouchie, ouchie.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.200
Shit.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.440
So, okay, then I need to clarify with you right now,

33:02.440 --> 33:04.560
like how extreme is this?

33:04.560 --> 33:05.800
Is it a phobia, would you call it?

33:05.800 --> 33:06.640
Yeah.

33:06.640 --> 33:07.460
I'm scared of the suit.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.520
Yeah, scared of the suit, I suppose.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.340
Yeah.

33:10.340 --> 33:12.320
And then if I have them remove their jackets,

33:12.320 --> 33:13.360
would that be enough for me?

33:13.360 --> 33:14.520
Yeah, I think so.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.600
Yeah, removing of the jacket is gonna be enough.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.760
It takes the power away.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.560
Okay, but okay, yeah.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.460
But okay.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.480
I just don't know how, like, when I go.

33:26.480 --> 33:29.520
I mean, literally, let's say as soon as you get up out

33:29.520 --> 33:33.600
of the pit and you're looking at them for the first time,

33:33.600 --> 33:35.600
and they're also covered in this stuff,

33:35.600 --> 33:39.180
like he was when you attacked him,

33:39.180 --> 33:41.480
you're gonna need them to change

33:41.480 --> 33:43.900
how they look pretty quickly, yeah.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.040
But it's, yeah, it's just an uncomfortable thing for me.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.680
Like, it's not gonna make me lash out at them, per se.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.760
No, but I think that you need

33:50.760 --> 33:52.800
to be pretty intense about it.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.920
Cool, yeah, I get that.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.000
I just mean, like, if I run into my,

33:56.000 --> 33:59.280
like, if I run into his thief, if I run into Typh,

33:59.920 --> 34:00.760
am I gonna be angry with him?

34:00.760 --> 34:02.040
I think you're just gonna be weird.

34:02.040 --> 34:02.880
Exactly, that's what I mean.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.200
Yes, weird, stilted, like, no eye contact,

34:06.200 --> 34:09.200
not cool-ass fucking Beck like you used to be.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.240
I'm all about it.

34:10.240 --> 34:13.080
Women in non-binary, women in non-binary people

34:13.080 --> 34:14.600
in suits are fine.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.540
I dig it.

34:16.540 --> 34:17.480
You should check the recording,

34:17.480 --> 34:19.440
make sure we're still recording after the lights blinked.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.040
We are still recording after the lights blinked.

34:24.460 --> 34:26.120
Luke, you can take your ears out.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.600
Ooh, I was making little beats, you know?

34:29.040 --> 34:31.540
I was like, damn, I would never listen to this shit.

34:34.200 --> 34:35.040
Man, it is.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.920
Dude, it is going nutso.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.040
Gettin' it out there.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.560
You should be quiet and try and get a good take-a-one

34:40.560 --> 34:42.120
that you can then loop whenever you need to.

34:42.120 --> 34:42.960
Yeah.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.820
Wow, that was a good one.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.500
Needs to, like, hit our house.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.000
Famous last podcast.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.940
That was a really good one.

35:00.940 --> 35:02.600
That was really good.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.920
Good job, Thomas.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.400
Thinking about thunder and lightning

35:11.400 --> 35:13.080
brought me to thinking about Thor,

35:13.080 --> 35:15.080
which brought me to thinking about Norse mythology,

35:15.080 --> 35:16.920
which brought me to thinking about Neil Gaiman,

35:16.920 --> 35:18.400
which brought me to thinking about Sandman,

35:18.400 --> 35:19.240
anybody's favorite?

35:19.240 --> 35:20.080
Yeah.

35:20.080 --> 35:20.900
Yeah.

35:20.900 --> 35:21.740
Yeah.

35:21.740 --> 35:22.580
Yeah.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.400
Yeah.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.240
Yeah.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.080
Yeah.

35:25.080 --> 35:25.900
Yeah.

35:25.900 --> 35:26.740
Yeah.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.580
Yeah.

35:27.580 --> 35:28.420
Thinking about Sandman,

35:28.420 --> 35:30.860
anybody started watching that on Netflix?

35:30.860 --> 35:32.540
I have not, but I want to.

35:32.540 --> 35:33.380
Is it good?

35:33.380 --> 35:35.740
I watched the first episode only, but I loved it.

35:35.740 --> 35:37.800
I thought it was a really cool first episode

35:37.800 --> 35:39.140
and it makes, I've never read the book,

35:39.140 --> 35:41.940
so I'm intrigued as to what is gonna happen.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.200
I definitely want to watch it.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.060
I just like, when it came out, I was like,

35:46.060 --> 35:49.080
I'm not in the mood to watch something like this

35:49.080 --> 35:51.220
because I wanted to watch something stupid.

35:51.220 --> 35:52.460
I wanna see it too.

35:52.460 --> 35:55.140
Yeah, so often I just wanna watch something stupid.

35:55.140 --> 35:58.860
Is his name Morpheus or Morby?

35:58.860 --> 36:00.740
It's not Morbius.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.420
I read the description and it was something like that.

36:02.420 --> 36:03.260
Morbius sounds right,

36:03.260 --> 36:05.240
cause he is the God of like dreams,

36:05.240 --> 36:08.060
which is in real life, who Morbius is.

36:08.060 --> 36:09.100
In real life?

36:11.180 --> 36:14.580
Did Neil Gaiman quickly write the books

36:14.580 --> 36:16.860
based off the Morbintime meme

36:16.860 --> 36:19.180
and then they produced a show and released it?

36:19.180 --> 36:20.220
You're thinking of The Matrix.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.060
Maybe.

36:21.060 --> 36:21.880
Oh, well.

36:21.880 --> 36:26.880
Oh, Morpheus slow down the river of live streaming.

36:29.960 --> 36:30.800
Whoa.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.520
Yeah, Joe's eyes just went white

36:32.520 --> 36:34.800
and he floated in the air for a second

36:34.800 --> 36:36.260
and he said that weird shit.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.720
I think it was a prophecy.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.600
That's just a little Rocky Horror picture show for you.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.080
All right.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.720
We're all out of the hole at this point.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.560
All four of you are out of the hole,

36:49.560 --> 36:52.800
looking down at the slumped body

36:52.800 --> 36:55.100
of Vernon Covington, the landlord,

36:55.100 --> 37:00.000
which Julius Summers has just used along with your help

37:00.000 --> 37:02.180
to get up out of the it pit.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.760
Wow.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.040
Did you hear that crackle in the headphones?

37:11.040 --> 37:11.860
It was good.

37:11.860 --> 37:12.700
That was wild.

37:12.700 --> 37:13.680
Whoa.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.200
Yeah, you're gonna have plenty of options

37:15.200 --> 37:17.720
of thunder samplings.

37:18.720 --> 37:22.040
And Beck looks up from his camera,

37:22.040 --> 37:25.040
looks at Cal and Julius,

37:25.040 --> 37:29.460
but with something different in his eyes.

37:30.780 --> 37:35.040
Hey, what's up, what's up, what's up fellas?

37:35.040 --> 37:37.380
It sure is hot today.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.980
Boy, howdy, you guys look like you're real hot.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.840
Would you guys want to take off your coats, please?

37:45.840 --> 37:47.760
Is it hot in here?

37:47.760 --> 37:49.480
Much to you, Beck.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.800
Yeah, yeah, thanks Cal.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.800
Julius, please.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.520
It's covered in shit and blood.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.680
I was planning on removing it anyway.

37:55.680 --> 37:56.960
Yeah, there you go.

37:56.960 --> 37:57.800
They're dirty.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.340
That's it.

37:59.340 --> 38:02.260
Julius is like, yeah, gross, and takes his off.

38:02.260 --> 38:03.100
Yeah.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.960
Yeah, cool.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.320
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.160
Yeah.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.280
Okay, so we were talking about whether we're going to

38:12.280 --> 38:14.680
like come out all.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.080
Yeah, whether we're going to go to Greg's GIZ

38:18.080 --> 38:20.400
or whether we're going to come out and say like,

38:20.400 --> 38:23.720
hey, what's up, we're back.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.340
We're ready for our trial now, please.

38:25.340 --> 38:27.360
Or we can get the fuck out of here.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.480
Stevie, do the people of Grover's Gorge

38:29.480 --> 38:30.960
know about the It Pit?

38:30.960 --> 38:34.600
Yeah, the people of Grover's Gorge know about the It Pit.

38:34.600 --> 38:35.440
All of them?

38:35.440 --> 38:36.260
Yeah.

38:36.260 --> 38:37.800
Do they know what it's like in there?

38:37.800 --> 38:39.920
Yeah, I think they do, Cal.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.340
Guys, I think we need to decide

38:42.340 --> 38:45.580
what we ultimately want to do

38:45.580 --> 38:48.820
before we go down any of these avenues, aren't we?

38:48.820 --> 38:50.540
Yes, let's make a five-year plan.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.940
Stevie, we were talking like in the hole,

38:54.940 --> 38:57.900
like is there a chance that we're looked favorably upon

38:57.900 --> 38:59.580
because of this landlord situation?

38:59.580 --> 39:01.660
Like maybe he's an asshole and everybody was like,

39:01.660 --> 39:02.740
thank God he's gone.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.380
Yeah, I mean, Fred definitely won't like it

39:05.380 --> 39:08.940
when he gets back, but we should have time hopefully

39:08.940 --> 39:11.940
until, I mean, they definitely told him

39:11.940 --> 39:13.280
that Sandro died.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.220
Like they definitely told him that Sandro died, so.

39:16.220 --> 39:19.100
Like, and he would come back for that turtle.

39:19.100 --> 39:24.100
Yeah, so he would definitely come back for that turtle, yeah.

39:24.940 --> 39:26.940
Was that just a turtle

39:26.940 --> 39:30.260
or was that turtle functionally the mayor of this town?

39:30.260 --> 39:32.300
Not functionally the mayor of this town,

39:32.300 --> 39:35.660
but pretty importantly, the mayor of this town.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.420
In like a community pride sense

39:37.420 --> 39:40.340
or in some weird dark forces way.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.300
Yeah, it's gonna be that second one.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.300
I'm gonna sound really out of control here

39:45.300 --> 39:47.540
while I'm talking, but just know

39:47.540 --> 39:50.420
that this is really out there.

39:50.420 --> 39:55.340
I did see a spirit or dark energy come out of the turtle.

39:55.340 --> 39:56.300
Quiet, Julius.

39:56.300 --> 39:57.860
Stevie was just about to tell us

39:57.860 --> 39:59.920
about the spooky shit going on with the turtle.

39:59.920 --> 40:00.760
Yeah.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.600
Yeah.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.060
No, no, that's go on.

40:07.420 --> 40:10.340
I didn't, you saw, you saw it?

40:10.340 --> 40:15.300
It had a, looked human almost.

40:15.300 --> 40:20.300
It was, I mean, it sounded like it was talking too,

40:21.580 --> 40:25.840
but not anything, not real words

40:25.840 --> 40:28.840
or words that I could understand.

40:28.840 --> 40:33.840
And when I saw it, I got this taste in my mouth,

40:34.320 --> 40:37.240
just salt, salty, saline.

40:37.240 --> 40:39.120
You saw God?

40:39.120 --> 40:42.360
Beck's eyes are wide looking at Julius.

40:42.360 --> 40:46.160
I, dude, like I saw like something too,

40:46.160 --> 40:48.640
but it like wasn't that, dude.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.480
I mean, what?

40:49.480 --> 40:51.440
But it's God?

40:51.440 --> 40:53.760
Yeah, I mean, I didn't.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.320
And she kind of looks down at the ground

40:57.320 --> 41:01.560
and is like, I kind of always thought that it wasn't real.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.200
Like there was some other explanation for all of this,

41:04.200 --> 41:08.040
but I'm starting to fucking freak out, man.

41:08.040 --> 41:11.600
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, calm down, calm down, Stevie.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.920
Listen to me, look at me, look into my eyes.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.400
She looks up at you.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.780
That's not God, God is a woman.

41:20.240 --> 41:24.240
She only loses two sanities, she's reassured by this.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.880
No, right, that's not God, but then what is it?

41:28.880 --> 41:31.340
Okay, but it is God because it did all this shit.

41:31.980 --> 41:32.820
It did everything.

41:32.820 --> 41:36.060
I mean, it's like, it's like gave him all the power.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.820
It's like, what did you, you saw it too, Beck?

41:38.820 --> 41:41.840
I mean, like I saw something like come out of the turtle

41:41.840 --> 41:44.020
and like go into Chuck.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.460
Did you see it go into Chuck?

41:45.460 --> 41:47.460
To me, I didn't like quite see like,

41:47.460 --> 41:49.500
it didn't look human to me exactly.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.780
And like, I didn't hear anything

41:51.780 --> 41:53.780
unless I didn't ask the right questions.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.820
There's no such thing as the right questions.

41:56.820 --> 41:58.140
I didn't like hear anything.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.940
Dude, like to me, it was just like,

42:00.940 --> 42:02.600
somebody like shot a super soaker

42:02.600 --> 42:04.000
out of the turtle into Chuck.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.060
What did you see, Cal?

42:05.060 --> 42:09.140
Hold on, hold on, you're both talking so fast, it's crazy.

42:09.140 --> 42:12.400
Now someone, I thought the turtle leaped to its death,

42:12.400 --> 42:14.140
but someone shot a super soaker at it?

42:14.140 --> 42:18.700
I mean, it looked like maybe that was what I saw.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.720
You remember how it like leapt off the edge, right?

42:20.720 --> 42:21.560
Yes.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.860
So then the super soaker came out up from beneath

42:23.860 --> 42:25.860
like where that, like where it would have

42:25.860 --> 42:27.960
probably like impacted is what like,

42:27.960 --> 42:30.340
I like inferred or whatever.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.300
And it like shot up and over and like into Chuck.

42:33.300 --> 42:38.000
The humanoid talking, tasting energy went into Chuck

42:38.000 --> 42:40.020
and he exploded through the glass.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.700
See, I didn't see like a humanoid thing.

42:41.700 --> 42:43.780
I just saw like a super soaker blast, dude.

42:43.780 --> 42:46.280
Boys, I need you to look at my fingers, please.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.300
How many fingers am I holding up?

42:48.300 --> 42:49.860
Five.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.580
Yeah, I'm counting five, my dude.

42:51.580 --> 42:53.400
Okay, I just needed to be sure

42:53.400 --> 42:55.500
you could still be trusted with the news.

42:56.580 --> 43:01.420
I mean like, yeah, dude, that's my biggest regret

43:01.420 --> 43:03.160
is that I didn't film this.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.300
I was startled.

43:04.300 --> 43:06.340
You didn't get a date.

43:06.340 --> 43:09.100
Remind Joe, I think I said that there was something else

43:09.100 --> 43:10.260
that startled me at the time, right?

43:10.260 --> 43:14.380
Well, you were shooting the deep healing that was happening.

43:14.380 --> 43:17.140
I think even Julius grabbed your camera or something.

43:17.140 --> 43:18.420
There was some reason that I remember

43:18.420 --> 43:19.940
it like jostled down to the ground.

43:19.940 --> 43:21.340
It was a failed roll, yeah.

43:21.340 --> 43:22.580
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

43:22.580 --> 43:24.980
Yeah, like it's not there, dude.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.180
It's not in the footage.

43:26.180 --> 43:27.640
Fuck.

43:27.640 --> 43:28.620
I got the aftermath,

43:28.620 --> 43:30.900
because you remember when Chuck went through that window?

43:30.900 --> 43:33.740
Like that was why he got pushed through that window.

43:33.740 --> 43:35.900
Because of God, who is a turtle?

43:35.900 --> 43:38.280
I'm not sure about the God thing.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.660
God turtle, Godel, God, is there something in there?

43:40.660 --> 43:41.940
God turtle.

43:41.940 --> 43:44.420
Cal, you fucking figured it out, my dude.

43:44.420 --> 43:49.400
God turtle, Godel, God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.460
Go back, back, back.

43:51.460 --> 43:52.300
But still.

43:52.820 --> 43:56.340
We don't want to reveal our position just yet.

43:57.940 --> 43:59.500
Stevie.

43:59.500 --> 44:00.340
Yeah?

44:00.340 --> 44:02.060
Is that why you're named Godel?

44:02.060 --> 44:03.380
I don't think so.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.220
You're the Godel.

44:13.580 --> 44:15.380
I never put that together.

44:15.380 --> 44:17.540
God turtle, God turtle, God turtle.

44:17.540 --> 44:21.940
Let's mark that hypothesis as a maybe.

44:22.620 --> 44:24.300
No potential.

44:24.300 --> 44:25.540
I mean, it's probably ancient times

44:25.540 --> 44:27.900
they've been worshiping the Godel turtle.

44:27.900 --> 44:31.460
Turtle, turtle, God total, God total.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.540
It's ancient, man.

44:32.540 --> 44:35.220
God damn it, that does follow linguistic principles.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.540
It makes sense.

44:39.540 --> 44:41.420
Stevie, like maybe you're figuring this out

44:41.420 --> 44:42.260
for the first time.

44:42.260 --> 44:44.100
Yeah, I think we cracked the code here, dude.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.860
I think we did, I think we figured it all out.

44:46.860 --> 44:48.040
This is amazing.

44:52.300 --> 44:54.700
Either way, we have to get out of here.

44:54.700 --> 44:56.740
And here it's Godel's all the way down.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.140
Oh my God.

45:02.140 --> 45:03.580
Total, total.

45:03.580 --> 45:07.380
Do we have enough incriminating footage

45:07.380 --> 45:11.620
and usable, good quality television to leave?

45:11.620 --> 45:14.380
I mean, I got a bunch of footage of that viscera pit,

45:14.380 --> 45:17.900
like that's, nobody's supposed to have like that

45:17.900 --> 45:19.420
on their property.

45:19.420 --> 45:20.820
If we can even leave,

45:20.860 --> 45:23.740
it might be time to start preparing our defense.

45:23.740 --> 45:26.380
Stevie, do you think you could get us out of here?

45:26.380 --> 45:29.300
If we stay, I can try.

45:29.300 --> 45:32.900
And if we leave, I'll try to help.

45:32.900 --> 45:34.800
Should we stay or should we go?

45:34.800 --> 45:37.980
Now, we have to decide.

45:37.980 --> 45:42.980
Personally, my vote is stay and risk our lives

45:43.420 --> 45:45.780
for great programming.

45:45.780 --> 45:47.340
If we stay, there could be trouble.

45:47.340 --> 45:48.180
Yeah.

45:48.220 --> 45:50.900
So, do you know what my uncle will say?

45:50.900 --> 45:52.100
There could be double, dude.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.340
There could be double.

45:53.340 --> 45:54.260
Why would your uncle say that?

45:54.260 --> 45:57.360
Yeah, why would he get upset because we're alive?

45:57.360 --> 45:59.560
The same reason I'm getting upset

45:59.560 --> 46:01.820
thinking about leaving this place.

46:03.980 --> 46:06.820
Which is what, you're not done getting your fucking story?

46:06.820 --> 46:09.060
You're willing to risk all of our lives for it?

46:09.060 --> 46:10.000
Precisely.

46:10.000 --> 46:10.840
Oh.

46:10.840 --> 46:11.680
Oh.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.100
Yeah, I mean, I-

46:13.100 --> 46:15.260
We have the story, Julius.

46:15.260 --> 46:16.580
But I'm sure there's more.

46:16.580 --> 46:17.940
There's a real part of Beck

46:17.940 --> 46:20.500
that is a little bit Julius in here,

46:20.500 --> 46:24.260
that this is footage that nobody's ever seen before.

46:24.260 --> 46:26.460
What else could we maybe get?

46:26.460 --> 46:30.500
I mean, guys, this is the story of the century.

46:30.500 --> 46:33.340
Only if we get it out of here.

46:33.340 --> 46:36.820
But the more we get, it could be its own canned show.

46:36.820 --> 46:38.220
Screw episodes, dude.

46:38.220 --> 46:40.460
We could do a whole documentary special

46:40.460 --> 46:43.660
and you'd win the Pulitzer for this, dude.

46:43.660 --> 46:45.780
I feel like I've lost some grip here.

46:45.820 --> 46:47.420
This is a very bad idea.

46:47.420 --> 46:50.300
Beck, you should know, this is a very bad idea.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.220
No, yeah, for sure, for sure, for sure.

46:52.220 --> 46:55.220
Cal, you know how in your house you've got

46:55.220 --> 46:58.760
pictures of you with famous people?

46:58.760 --> 47:01.860
You could be one of those people

47:01.860 --> 47:04.860
that people have pictures of in their house.

47:04.860 --> 47:07.020
I am one of those people, Julius.

47:07.020 --> 47:08.620
Do you wanna be one of those people?

47:08.620 --> 47:10.340
Because you won't if you die here.

47:10.340 --> 47:12.160
And I won't if I leave with all we have.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.780
With this amazing footage we already have,

47:14.780 --> 47:17.680
we have a treasure and you are getting greedy for more.

47:17.680 --> 47:18.520
I am.

47:18.520 --> 47:20.660
And I won't follow you to this death.

47:20.660 --> 47:22.760
Julius just looks at Beck.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.020
Beck does, part of him really still wanna stay in film,

47:25.020 --> 47:28.000
but I mean, I guess this place isn't going anywhere.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.380
Like, could we come back with maybe like?

47:30.380 --> 47:31.660
We can come back with.

47:31.660 --> 47:33.220
A bigger crew or whatever?

47:33.220 --> 47:35.260
An armed federal escort.

47:35.260 --> 47:39.180
We will report on this place when it is raided

47:39.180 --> 47:40.620
by the federal government.

47:40.620 --> 47:42.780
What we have now is enough to make that happen.

47:42.780 --> 47:44.620
Julius just kind of nods his head.

47:45.500 --> 47:47.660
He absolutely still would like to stay and shoot more,

47:47.660 --> 47:50.100
but he knows that this is a team

47:50.100 --> 47:52.500
and that he has basically been outvoted

47:52.500 --> 47:54.080
and so he's not gonna argue anymore.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.740
Okay, the best way getting out of here

47:55.740 --> 47:58.420
is gonna be around the back of this factory

47:58.420 --> 48:00.020
and then we're gonna get into the trees.

48:00.020 --> 48:01.240
We're gonna take the tree line

48:01.240 --> 48:03.460
all the way to the big plant wall.

48:03.460 --> 48:06.700
We're gonna have our fucking teeth in that wall

48:06.700 --> 48:09.980
as we just crouch and kind of shuffle our way

48:09.980 --> 48:12.740
as quietly and as smoothly as possible.

48:13.260 --> 48:15.500
Across this plant wall all the way to the door.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.900
Possibly like walking, like you're sitting.

48:17.900 --> 48:20.340
I think that that would probably keep us

48:20.340 --> 48:22.480
out of the view of the most people.

48:24.540 --> 48:27.900
Kal is like silently composing a personnel complaint.

48:29.800 --> 48:33.300
Julius is a little bit happier knowing that he can leave

48:33.300 --> 48:35.540
with at least a cool escape TikTok.

48:37.820 --> 48:39.820
Is she suggesting further east?

48:39.820 --> 48:41.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:41.180 --> 48:44.140
So just further east, just straight into the forest

48:44.140 --> 48:46.820
is where she pointed, like straight into this tree line,

48:46.820 --> 48:48.820
this thick tree line that's on the far east side

48:48.820 --> 48:51.640
and then going as far south as possible,

48:51.640 --> 48:53.300
like staying in the trees the entire way

48:53.300 --> 48:56.860
down to the plant wall and then walking across the plant wall

48:56.860 --> 48:58.900
over on the south side that you came in

48:58.900 --> 49:00.900
and finding that door and then getting out.

49:00.900 --> 49:01.740
The door that we came in.

49:01.740 --> 49:02.940
The door that you came in.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.220
So we're going east into the woods

49:04.220 --> 49:06.340
and then south using the woods as cover.

49:06.340 --> 49:07.280
Got it, got it.

49:07.280 --> 49:10.400
Is there anywhere we could raid a supply closet

49:10.400 --> 49:13.400
or something for extra onesies?

49:13.400 --> 49:14.800
I like the green ones myself.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.080
The green ones would be in the lab

49:17.080 --> 49:19.360
or in the super nice GIZs.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.840
It is not important, just the nearest ones.

49:21.840 --> 49:24.720
Yeah, I mean those would be here in the factory

49:24.720 --> 49:28.720
but I think we're risking a lot by trying to go in there.

49:28.720 --> 49:31.100
That'd be like a whole other episode probably.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.200
Where are the GIZs to here?

49:33.200 --> 49:35.400
All the way across, like on the far other side,

49:35.400 --> 49:39.080
like the full west side or like the green,

49:39.080 --> 49:43.120
like all the EEs live on the super far west side.

49:43.120 --> 49:46.160
Did they leave some of their EE cummings in that pit?

49:46.160 --> 49:47.400
Oh, thank God.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.440
Yeah, there was punctuation fucking everywhere.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.160
Oh, it fucking influenced so many terrible Instagram poets.

49:59.280 --> 50:01.280
I like the ones where they grab that newspaper

50:01.280 --> 50:02.640
and black out a bunch of words

50:02.640 --> 50:05.280
and just leave some of them that make a poem.

50:05.280 --> 50:06.120
I haven't seen that.

50:06.120 --> 50:06.940
That's kind of nice.

50:06.940 --> 50:07.780
That's fun.

50:07.820 --> 50:11.040
I like the one where this guy takes a piece of bologna

50:11.040 --> 50:12.540
and pokes a bunch of holes in it

50:12.540 --> 50:16.620
and then slaps it on a page and then that's the poem.

50:16.620 --> 50:19.820
Do you think he'd poke the holes first or afterward?

50:19.820 --> 50:21.860
Well, some of them don't work.

50:21.860 --> 50:23.180
So I think he just does it.

50:25.180 --> 50:26.020
That's how you know.

50:26.020 --> 50:28.540
I definitely thought you were just riffing that.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.700
No, it's a thing I've seen.

50:30.700 --> 50:35.220
Well, I've seen a guy take bologna and poke holes in it.

50:35.220 --> 50:36.460
I was like, oh, that's good.

50:36.460 --> 50:37.460
What's mine gonna be?

50:37.780 --> 50:38.620
Yeah.

50:41.020 --> 50:43.020
This footage now from Beck's camera

50:43.020 --> 50:44.900
is like when you're watching a documentary

50:44.900 --> 50:47.020
and shit hits the fan and it pans around

50:47.020 --> 50:50.380
and you see the boom operator is rolling out.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.900
You guys are in front of me and it's hazard.

50:52.900 --> 50:54.020
It's shaky cam.

50:54.020 --> 50:54.860
It's shaky cam.

50:54.860 --> 50:56.420
It's some Blair Witch Cloverfield.

50:56.420 --> 50:57.260
Going through the woods.

50:57.260 --> 50:59.180
Oh, and these woods are pretty intense.

50:59.180 --> 51:00.380
We all look a little panicked.

51:00.380 --> 51:02.740
People do not traipse through these woods.

51:02.740 --> 51:05.000
So it is thick brush.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.500
Is Julia still almost dead?

51:06.540 --> 51:07.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:07.380 --> 51:08.220
He's at two hit points.

51:08.220 --> 51:11.180
So literally he's barely breathing.

51:11.180 --> 51:14.020
He's able to make all these points and stuff,

51:14.020 --> 51:15.900
but he mostly got hit in the face.

51:15.900 --> 51:19.220
My head, I am bruised eyeballs.

51:19.220 --> 51:23.780
Internal brain hemorrhaging probably.

51:23.780 --> 51:24.620
Oh, that explains it.

51:24.620 --> 51:25.460
Yeah, it's not.

51:25.460 --> 51:26.740
I'm gonna die of a blood clot

51:26.740 --> 51:29.140
and we don't get any help soon.

51:29.140 --> 51:32.120
You look over at Julius and one of his eyes

51:32.120 --> 51:33.940
is completely filled with blood

51:33.940 --> 51:36.720
and it's starting to drip from the wrong corner,

51:36.720 --> 51:38.180
like not from his tear duct.

51:38.180 --> 51:41.440
This crazed half dead man who can barely walk

51:41.440 --> 51:42.980
is like, we gotta stay here.

51:42.980 --> 51:43.820
Yeah.

51:43.820 --> 51:44.660
Yeah.

51:44.660 --> 51:45.980
Exactly.

51:45.980 --> 51:48.060
And Cal, for some reason,

51:48.060 --> 51:49.780
like argued it in a good face

51:49.780 --> 51:52.340
instead of just being like, no, you idiot.

51:52.340 --> 51:53.180
Like, do you?

51:53.180 --> 51:54.000
We need to kill you.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.840
What?

51:54.840 --> 51:56.540
You could like push him over and kill him.

51:56.540 --> 51:57.580
Yeah, like.

51:57.580 --> 52:01.140
There's a 50-50 chance that a punch would kill him.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.700
Or, you know.

52:03.700 --> 52:04.540
I can't punch him.

52:08.420 --> 52:11.060
It's actually a 66% chance now that I think about it

52:11.060 --> 52:12.860
because it's D4 minus one.

52:12.860 --> 52:14.580
Wait, so nope, that's, fuck.

52:14.580 --> 52:15.860
That'd be 33% chance.

52:15.860 --> 52:18.340
That's 50-50 if it's a D4 minus one.

52:18.340 --> 52:19.260
But I have two.

52:19.260 --> 52:20.100
Yeah.

52:20.100 --> 52:21.760
Oh, so one, yeah, you're right.

52:21.760 --> 52:22.600
Fuck.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.780
Anyway, don't punch me.

52:24.940 --> 52:29.140
Julius with his brain not working as well right now.

52:29.140 --> 52:30.180
I'll take a minute.

52:30.180 --> 52:31.020
It's a weird one.

52:31.860 --> 52:34.580
This would be a really bad place to drive a four-wheeler.

52:34.580 --> 52:36.400
I don't understand the reference.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.460
Julius doesn't either.

52:37.460 --> 52:41.060
He's, his brain's just starting to shut off.

52:41.060 --> 52:42.340
Stevie pats you on the back.

52:42.340 --> 52:45.260
She's like, it's okay, grandpa, we're almost out.

52:45.260 --> 52:47.220
What else do we see?

52:47.220 --> 52:49.700
Oh, shit, I mean, oh no.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.540
He's Frank Gotthold.

52:50.540 --> 52:52.100
Ah, fuck, Julius Gotthold.

52:52.100 --> 52:53.340
I mean, Caesar, I mean.

52:53.340 --> 52:54.660
I mean, fuck.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.060
Oh yeah, we're walking.

52:57.060 --> 52:59.740
We finally get to the big plant wall.

52:59.740 --> 53:02.180
And okay, guys, it's shimmying time.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.940
This is when Julius pulled his phone out to.

53:03.940 --> 53:06.020
Shimmy, shimmy, y'all, shimmy, y'all, shimmy.

53:06.020 --> 53:09.320
I'm gonna get in behind and TikTok them walking

53:09.320 --> 53:10.860
however they're gonna be walking.

53:10.860 --> 53:12.420
Yep, not being weird about it.

53:13.460 --> 53:16.640
This is the point where we need to be really sneaky.

53:16.640 --> 53:19.700
So I need everyone to roll stealth.

53:22.340 --> 53:23.380
40 on a 40.

53:23.380 --> 53:24.880
Wow.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.180
You got a 65 on a 40.

53:27.180 --> 53:28.500
I'm sorry, a 30.

53:30.060 --> 53:31.020
Fail.

53:31.020 --> 53:32.740
I only have 10% in stealth.

53:33.660 --> 53:34.500
And I got a three.

53:34.500 --> 53:35.860
Oh yeah.

53:35.860 --> 53:37.580
Wow.

53:37.580 --> 53:40.900
I thought that I would just kind of give an alertness check

53:40.900 --> 53:43.500
for just like all of Grover's gorge.

53:44.700 --> 53:47.780
And Luke, will you check out what I rolled there?

53:51.100 --> 53:52.560
He rolled a 100.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.060
Oh, fuck yeah.

53:54.060 --> 53:58.180
So they are all taking a big long blink.

53:58.180 --> 54:00.520
Literally in my head, I was like, what do I give them?

54:00.520 --> 54:03.620
Like 80% as an entire city?

54:03.620 --> 54:05.820
Like for someone to see.

54:05.820 --> 54:08.740
We're only in part of the city and the part

54:08.740 --> 54:09.660
that's best to hide in.

54:09.660 --> 54:11.980
Well, then it's a great thing for everyone

54:11.980 --> 54:14.260
that I rolled a 100 just now.

54:14.260 --> 54:15.100
Holy shit.

54:15.100 --> 54:17.060
As you guys hit the door,

54:17.060 --> 54:22.060
creak it open and take one last look out at Grover's gorge.

54:22.220 --> 54:26.300
You all actually notice why all the residents

54:26.300 --> 54:28.540
are not paying you any mind.

54:28.540 --> 54:31.980
You see Chuck Bidwell, bright blue eyes,

54:31.980 --> 54:34.060
face lined by the sun,

54:34.060 --> 54:39.060
topped by a tight flat top of salt and pepper hair stocky,

54:39.820 --> 54:43.500
the muscle of his youth turned fat.

54:43.500 --> 54:48.500
And Chuck Bidwell wearing his green polo

54:49.220 --> 54:54.220
is absolutely drenched, wet, soaking

54:54.660 --> 54:57.940
as he walks through Grover's gorge.

54:57.940 --> 55:00.620
You grab the door, close it shut.

55:03.260 --> 55:05.540
Click on the other side.

55:05.540 --> 55:07.380
And you guys are standing,

55:07.380 --> 55:10.340
looking out at the massive gorge

55:10.340 --> 55:13.020
that you saw when you arrived.

55:13.020 --> 55:16.620
Fog is filling up this enormous gorge.

55:16.620 --> 55:18.460
And you see that the train,

55:18.460 --> 55:22.660
the single steel train car is sitting

55:22.660 --> 55:24.740
on your side of the gorge.

55:24.740 --> 55:26.860
Just how it was the last time you were here.

55:26.860 --> 55:30.620
Cal sees Julius tick-tocking all of this.

55:30.620 --> 55:33.700
And he says, Julius, put that fucking phone away

55:33.700 --> 55:34.780
and get on the train.

55:38.940 --> 55:41.700
Julius gets up flush with the train

55:41.700 --> 55:45.620
and is gonna tick-tock you guys walking into the train

55:45.620 --> 55:47.260
and then get in the train.

55:47.260 --> 55:49.060
And he saves it in drafts

55:49.060 --> 55:52.080
with his six other tick-tocks he's taken

55:52.360 --> 55:53.320
since he's been here.

55:55.800 --> 55:58.640
Cal takes a big like stress bite out of his lasagna.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.840
What's up everybody?

56:07.840 --> 56:08.800
I'm Zach.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.400
And I hope you're enjoying season two

56:10.400 --> 56:12.400
of Pretending to Be People so far.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.000
We're having a ton of fun.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.120
And that fun isn't going to stop,

56:16.120 --> 56:18.640
but it is gonna slow down a bit.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.600
Putting the show out mostly weekly

56:20.640 --> 56:24.000
for almost three years now has been my pleasure.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.520
And I'm tired.

56:25.520 --> 56:29.840
It's been affecting my mood for the past month or six,

56:29.840 --> 56:31.040
which sucks.

56:31.040 --> 56:35.600
And I want this show to continue to be a pleasure to create.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.040
And I don't want the quality of the show to suffer.

56:38.040 --> 56:39.440
So in order for that to happen,

56:39.440 --> 56:40.640
we're going to move

56:40.640 --> 56:43.240
to an every other Friday release schedule.

56:43.240 --> 56:46.320
Now the goal is to get back to weekly episodes.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.520
So I've reached out to someone who can help lighten my load

56:49.560 --> 56:50.800
on the editing side of things

56:50.800 --> 56:52.760
by cleaning up the tracks of debris

56:52.760 --> 56:54.400
before I finish them off.

56:54.400 --> 56:57.120
But that process will take time to smooth out

56:57.120 --> 56:58.960
and it will expedite the process,

56:58.960 --> 57:00.400
but it'll still take time and money.

57:00.400 --> 57:04.200
So with our eyes set on getting back to weekly,

57:04.200 --> 57:07.600
we've got two new Patreon goals.

57:07.600 --> 57:10.920
The first is at $5,785,

57:10.920 --> 57:15.720
which is of course $69,420 over the year.

57:15.720 --> 57:16.760
At this first goal,

57:16.800 --> 57:18.520
pretending to be people will move

57:18.520 --> 57:20.440
from every other Friday releases

57:20.440 --> 57:22.440
to three episodes per month,

57:22.440 --> 57:26.720
dropped on the first, 11th, and 21st.

57:26.720 --> 57:30.200
The Patreon goal to go back to weekly releases

57:30.200 --> 57:35.200
is set at, you guessed it, $6,942 per month.

57:35.280 --> 57:38.640
And when we hit the PTBP radio frequency,

57:38.640 --> 57:40.240
we'll be once again swaddled

57:40.240 --> 57:43.960
in Wolf's warm and weekly embrace.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.160
But with the sad news,

57:45.160 --> 57:48.600
I also bring three fun announcements.

57:48.600 --> 57:51.640
First, we recently recorded another side story

57:51.640 --> 57:52.560
for season two,

57:52.560 --> 57:57.320
and we had another mind-blowingly talented guest.

57:57.320 --> 58:01.320
Becca Scott joined us for a four episode

58:01.320 --> 58:04.000
modern Delta Green operation set in the city.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.160
She was fantastic.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.040
We were fantastic.

58:08.040 --> 58:10.600
I'm seriously, I'm so excited for y'all to hear it.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.200
It's nasty.

58:12.200 --> 58:16.480
Second, the Den of Sin will be live on Tuesday, October 25th

58:16.480 --> 58:19.760
for a very special Halloween episode.

58:19.760 --> 58:22.880
We'll be following Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore III,

58:22.880 --> 58:27.520
and Keith Vigna as kids at Clinkers Daycare

58:27.520 --> 58:29.760
as they go trick or treating in contention

58:29.760 --> 58:32.040
on what could not so canonically

58:32.040 --> 58:34.640
be their last Halloween ever.

58:35.600 --> 58:37.680
And the edited podcast episode of that game

58:37.680 --> 58:41.160
will be out before the November Den of Sin,

58:41.200 --> 58:44.080
which is the third and final cool thing.

58:44.080 --> 58:46.520
And November Thomas is going to kick off

58:46.520 --> 58:51.520
his Oops All Pettymore's Patreon campaign

58:51.680 --> 58:54.440
with a Pettymore family Thanksgiving.

58:54.440 --> 58:58.040
Joe, Luke, and I will all be playing members of the fam

58:58.040 --> 59:02.760
for the run, and we are really fucking excited about it.

59:04.800 --> 59:08.800
Okay, seriously, thank you so much for listening.

59:08.800 --> 59:11.880
This is a wildly cool thing to be a part of,

59:11.880 --> 59:14.080
and I really hope it continues to be fun,

59:14.080 --> 59:16.920
and rad, and sick, and twisted, because I like it.

59:16.920 --> 59:19.920
["My Life Is Great"]

59:19.920 --> 59:22.920
["My Life Is Great"]

59:39.680 --> 59:41.480
But it is a little gummy, you know?

59:41.480 --> 59:42.960
If you wadded it up, it'd be...

59:42.960 --> 59:44.960
No, it's a very long gummy.

59:44.960 --> 59:45.800
But it's thin.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.880
You can only fold a fruit by the foot

59:47.920 --> 59:49.840
on itself eight times before.

59:49.840 --> 59:51.480
Oh my God, is that true?

59:51.480 --> 59:52.320
Yeah.

59:52.320 --> 59:53.160
I think it needs a square, right?

59:53.160 --> 59:54.000
Yeah, any loser.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.880
Make them fold eight times.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.840
If you fold a fucking nerd.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.480
And I say, hey, do you want to see how much I can bend you?

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.320
Did it just lightning?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.240
Shut up, nerd.
