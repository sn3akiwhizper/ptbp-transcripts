00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
Well, babies, I cannot believe I finally arrived at Ocean City, New Jersey, and it's 2016?

00:09.840 --> 00:11.400
And it's March?

00:11.400 --> 00:15.360
Well, fuck, this should be a fun detour, I guess.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.000
God damn it.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.760
I guess...

00:18.760 --> 00:22.200
Guess I can do another radio show or something.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.880
We're live from 694.2 PTBP or whatever.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.640
Some nice person wrote us a thing.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.080
Maybe I'll read that.

00:32.080 --> 00:38.320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dale Armont in Arkansas, who tweeted about the

00:38.320 --> 00:44.120
show and tagged at Pretending Pod, which is always the third thing I do while sitting

00:44.120 --> 00:45.120
on the toilet.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.840
Do you sit down to pee?

00:46.840 --> 00:48.260
I sure do.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.760
It's comfy.

00:49.760 --> 00:56.360
Thanks for tweeting about the show and tagging at Pretending Pod Dale Armont from Arkansas.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.360
He writes,

01:21.840 --> 01:24.000
Oh wow, Dale.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
A Wolfie never reveals their secrets, especially secrets about their incredibly moisturized

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
nipples.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Wink.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.960
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how, send in your message as a five-star

01:37.960 --> 01:44.680
review on Apple Podcasts, and I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP.

01:44.680 --> 01:51.040
Ocean City, New Jersey's newest and only radio station, probably.

01:51.040 --> 01:57.200
And I'll be right back after a word from our only sponsor, Zach.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.200
What's up, what's up?

01:58.200 --> 01:59.200
It's Zach.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.680
I am here to tell you four things.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.460
First, I want to say thank you to this community.

02:04.460 --> 02:12.440
After some last minute donations from you folks, we've raised $1,525 to help keep

02:12.440 --> 02:15.840
Springfieldians warm this winter.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.000
That's absolutely incredible.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.200
Thank you to each and every one of you listening who's told a friend about the show or joined

02:22.200 --> 02:24.980
the Patreon or tagged us on the internet.

02:24.980 --> 02:27.280
This is all thanks to you.

02:27.280 --> 02:32.360
Second, I want to say thank you to all of you eager listeners for your patience.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.720
Here's a little life update.

02:33.720 --> 02:39.600
Taylor and I have moved back to Springfield, Missouri, and we will be in Springfield, Missouri

02:39.600 --> 02:44.380
until we eventually die in Springfield, Missouri.

02:44.380 --> 02:45.380
We love it here.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.440
The food game is strong.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
It's cheap.

02:47.480 --> 02:52.780
We just started a big boy job at a real company and we're about to move into a rental while

02:52.780 --> 02:56.680
we house hunt in this super fun market.

02:56.680 --> 03:03.880
I'm hoping the transition won't affect our release schedule too much, but I'm an optimist

03:03.880 --> 03:04.880
for real though.

03:04.880 --> 03:10.160
We have some really cool shit planned and we're all super stoked about it.

03:10.200 --> 03:16.320
Third, we just recently released our 27th Patreon bonus episode.

03:16.320 --> 03:21.880
Luke GM'd a game of Uncanny Rally for Joe, Thomas, and me.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.840
It's one of those one-page RPGs from Grant Hallett.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.360
We played malfunctioning military androids on the run.

03:29.360 --> 03:35.060
It was delightfully silly and Luke did a wonderful job leading us on our wacky way.

03:35.060 --> 03:43.900
So for $5 a month you can hear that and 26 other bonus episodes which do include a 13

03:43.900 --> 03:51.420
episode long mostly homebrew Delta Green campaign that winds through time by connecting surviving

03:51.420 --> 03:59.620
agents from each mission to continued unnatural mysteries and military conspiracies.

03:59.620 --> 04:06.060
And finally, if you're an esteemed naughty denizen of the den of sin, get ready for this

04:06.060 --> 04:13.460
Thursday, the eve of New Year's Eve, January 30th at 7pm Central Time.

04:13.460 --> 04:19.500
We're gonna hang out and celebrate the end of 2021, talk about our plans for 2022, and

04:19.500 --> 04:26.040
we're also each in charge of bringing a segment to the episode, so we'll see what happens

04:26.040 --> 04:27.660
with that.

04:27.660 --> 04:32.420
If you have any suggestions, post them on the internet.

04:32.420 --> 04:39.820
And come hang out this Thursday night, yeah, New Year's Eve, January 30th at 7pm Central

04:39.820 --> 04:40.820
Time.

04:40.820 --> 04:46.280
Okay, sorry that took so long, thanks for listening to our podcast, bye.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.780
If that sad Zach character gave you the blues, and God knows he gives me the blues, you're

04:51.780 --> 04:55.180
welcome to cheer up now, it's time for the news.

04:55.420 --> 05:02.620
A former Delta Green agent named Arvon Chilton is missing and on the run today after a string

05:02.620 --> 05:08.080
of brutal homicides have all pointed in his singular direction.

05:08.080 --> 05:12.100
He is assumed to be armed and dangerous.

05:12.100 --> 05:17.260
Again, this is a former Delta Green agent named Arvon Chilton.

05:17.260 --> 05:24.200
Mr. Chilton parked his car in the driveway of his ex-wife, Eileen McCarty, and her new

05:24.200 --> 05:26.920
husband, Marcus McCarty.

05:26.920 --> 05:35.000
Then, this fucking dude, Arvon Chilton, walked inside, disabled and tied up the new husband,

05:35.000 --> 05:39.320
and then slowly cut Eileen McCarty to pieces in front of the guy.

05:39.320 --> 05:45.540
Later, Arvon Chilton carefully cut out the new husband's eyes, all before he disemboweled

05:45.540 --> 05:50.040
and untied the blind, bleeding out broken man.

05:50.200 --> 05:55.680
Marcus McCarty died sometime later, crawling towards the front door.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.080
Welcome to 694.2.

05:58.080 --> 06:03.640
If you aren't down with that level of awful, this show might not be good for you.

06:03.640 --> 06:10.200
But for now, let's just groove on this melodic palate cleanser that's brand spanking new.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.680
It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.480
The deep end, but the drowning's been just fine

06:25.480 --> 06:33.800
And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind

06:33.800 --> 06:41.960
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face

06:41.960 --> 06:49.640
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face

06:54.200 --> 06:56.360
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

06:56.360 --> 07:01.880
We're gonna play Control Copy, which is a Delta Green scenario written by Dennis Detwiller,

07:01.880 --> 07:06.280
one of the creators of the game, Delta Green, the Role Playing Game.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.280
Yeah!

07:08.280 --> 07:10.280
Oh, too much.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.720
We are playing Control Copy specifically because we put up a poll

07:19.880 --> 07:21.560
on our Patreon.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.800
And only those who pay us money could vote.

07:23.800 --> 07:28.840
And only those who pay us money could vote, and they chose Control Copy.

07:28.840 --> 07:33.800
Hey, let's introduce ourselves to anyone who is listening to this who hasn't listened to us before.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.400
My name is Zach, and I'm gonna be your handler today,

07:37.400 --> 07:41.720
as well as after you listen to this when you go back and listen to all of season one,

07:41.720 --> 07:44.840
of Pretending to Be People, I'll be the handler for that as well.

07:44.840 --> 07:49.240
I'm Joe! I play. I'm one of the characters. I play in all the games.

07:50.760 --> 07:51.720
Every single one of them.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.880
What is your role, Joe? How do you see your role here at Pretending to Be People?

07:57.880 --> 08:02.280
I think the most official role I have is note taker, and even that's tenuous at times,

08:02.280 --> 08:05.640
because I get involved in what's happening and forget to write stuff down.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.120
That happens to everybody, man. That's role playing, baby.

08:08.120 --> 08:08.840
Yeah, that's what my problem is.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.920
That's happened to Luke and I for the last 60 episodes.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.120
I was so enthralled.

08:16.280 --> 08:22.200
I'm Luke. I play, too. And my goal, my role...

08:22.200 --> 08:23.080
What's your goal?

08:23.080 --> 08:23.960
Goal? Have fun.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.960
Role. Have fun.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.840
I don't take notes.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.760
They're all up here.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.000
He points at his head.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.880
Yeah, audio.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.600
He pointed at Joe's notebook.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.280
But yeah, you know, I just kind of go with the flow, and I try to get things rolling, you know?

08:48.920 --> 08:50.600
Yes, you certainly do that.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.760
You can really feel the energy just, like, shooting off of him.

08:56.520 --> 09:00.360
I'm Thomas, and sometimes I take notes, and...

09:01.160 --> 09:04.040
I thought that this just became whether or not you take notes.

09:04.040 --> 09:04.760
Notes or no notes.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.760
I plan to take notes on this campaign.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.480
Joe was like, I'm Joe, and I'm a character,

09:09.480 --> 09:12.120
so I just want to make it clear that I'm Thomas, and I'm a person.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.400
But I do play characters on the show.

09:17.400 --> 09:22.120
All right, so that's us, and this is Delta Green,

09:22.120 --> 09:24.760
and we're going to play Delta Green.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.440
Are you guys ready to play Delta Green?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.320
I'm scared.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.960
Normally, on season one of Pretending to Be People,

09:31.960 --> 09:36.120
we played an amalgamation of Delta Green and Pulp Cthulhu.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.440
And you guys had lots of hit points and luck to spend.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.800
However, in this game today, you will have no special talents.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.080
Your hit points will be your strength plus your con,

09:49.640 --> 09:55.000
divided by two, as opposed to just strength plus con,

09:55.640 --> 09:57.880
and you will have no luck.

09:58.520 --> 10:02.120
So let's introduce your characters.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.840
A young boy, far larger than average for his age,

10:05.800 --> 10:08.360
sits crying in the hallway of an elementary school

10:08.360 --> 10:10.440
as a group of children laugh and run away.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.240
He's wearing a yellow long-sleeve t-shirt and blue overalls.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.200
His glasses are thick, thick enough to give the illusion

10:18.200 --> 10:21.000
that the wearer has cartoonishly giant eyes.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.560
The tears are magnified behind the glass lenses

10:23.560 --> 10:26.680
as he sniffles and laughs echo down the hallway.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.560
A small boy approaches the weeping, hulking figure.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.560
They're assholes, fuck them.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.000
What's your name, Bigfoot?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.280
Kevin.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.280
The crying boy says as he wipes his face

10:38.280 --> 10:41.560
and looks up at the acne-ridden face of Elwood Boyd.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.400
Kevin wipes the sweat from his face

10:43.400 --> 10:45.640
and looks up into the stadium lights.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.720
The light glints off his athletic goggles,

10:47.720 --> 10:49.560
which give his eyes a bulging look.

10:50.280 --> 10:58.280
Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen! Menyen!

10:58.280 --> 11:01.080
The crowd chants his nickname as he stands on the field,

11:01.080 --> 11:03.320
towering above the other boys surrounding him.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.520
Hike!

11:04.520 --> 11:06.120
The sound of young men shouting

11:06.120 --> 11:08.520
and football pads clashing fills the air.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.960
Kevin throws the boy opposite him to the ground with a crunch.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.040
His eyes focus on the opposing quarterback

11:14.040 --> 11:15.800
and he launches himself forward.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.120
The small, frail boy holding the football

11:18.120 --> 11:20.280
is almost invisible under Kevin's shadow

11:20.280 --> 11:22.680
as the monstrous high schooler leaps towards him.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.680
Ahh!

11:24.680 --> 11:28.200
A piercing scream is heard as Kevin smashes into the child,

11:28.200 --> 11:29.800
sending the boy flying backwards

11:29.800 --> 11:31.560
and the football up into the air.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.800
Kevin jumps up to grab the ball

11:33.800 --> 11:35.560
and sprints towards the end zone.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.640
The entire crowd is chanting his name

11:37.640 --> 11:39.400
as he hulks toward the goal.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.480
When the minion reaches the end of the field,

11:41.480 --> 11:43.480
he spikes the football down.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.320
Instead of bouncing back into the air,

11:45.320 --> 11:48.040
the ball burrows itself into the earth.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.240
What's your last name again?

11:49.240 --> 11:50.280
Gelato.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.960
That's another defensive touchdown

11:53.960 --> 11:59.000
for Kevin Gelato and the Spiro Agnu High!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.520
Nope, I already have this written out.

12:01.960 --> 12:08.360
That's the end of the minions five undefeated years

12:08.360 --> 12:10.120
here at Spiro Agnu High!

12:10.840 --> 12:14.040
The announcer shouts as the crowd runs onto the field.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.640
I'm so proud of you bro!

12:15.640 --> 12:17.960
You're gonna do big things!

12:17.960 --> 12:20.040
The voice of Stuart, Kevin's younger brother,

12:20.040 --> 12:23.720
fades out as we see Kevin standing in an elegant hallway

12:23.720 --> 12:25.320
with a dumb smile on his face.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.520
The smile quickly fades into a stony expression

12:28.520 --> 12:30.120
as Elwood's voice fades in,

12:30.120 --> 12:32.440
asking questions not necessarily intended

12:32.440 --> 12:33.720
to be answered by Kevin.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
Kevin gives Elwood a quick smile,

12:36.280 --> 12:38.840
but the eyes behind his goggles are deeply sad.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.200
Okay Elwood, let's go.

12:43.080 --> 12:43.580
Nice!

12:44.360 --> 12:45.240
And Elwood.

12:45.240 --> 12:45.740
Hey!

12:47.240 --> 12:48.440
I'm playing Elwood.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.800
Elwood Boyd.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.400
And see Kevin, if I turn this here, click,

12:54.040 --> 12:56.840
and I snip this here, we should get...

12:57.560 --> 12:59.640
And a safe door slowly opens in front of them,

12:59.640 --> 13:02.520
revealing a cartoonish horde of jewels and cash.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.280
A smile spreads across Elwood Boyd's pale, pockmarked,

13:06.280 --> 13:09.240
and pimpled face, revealing rows of yellowed teeth

13:09.240 --> 13:11.320
that seem to have all collectively decided

13:11.320 --> 13:12.920
no two would grow in the same angle.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.080
He stands wearing an argyle sweater vest

13:19.080 --> 13:20.920
over a yellow-brown colored button-up,

13:20.920 --> 13:22.680
khaki pants, and golfing shoes,

13:22.680 --> 13:24.840
but the whole ensemble looks like it was recently

13:24.840 --> 13:28.040
retrieved from a dumpster, all wrinkled and lightly,

13:28.040 --> 13:29.880
and in some places not so lightly,

13:29.880 --> 13:32.040
stained and fitting poorly.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.520
Kevin hands Elwood a fresh duffel bag,

13:35.160 --> 13:37.240
and Elwood extends a thin, bony arm

13:37.240 --> 13:39.240
to start scooping in the latest score.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.760
See, there's nothing to it.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.240
Well, at least for me, I don't know how you'd fare.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.200
But it's like I can see the inner workings of these things.

13:49.240 --> 13:49.960
I always have.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.320
I don't know where this comes from.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.640
Here, take this bag too.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.760
And Elwood stands and hands another duffel bag

13:56.760 --> 13:57.560
over to Kevin.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.520
He now has three draped over his body.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.440
All right, so we've gone through every room, right?

14:02.440 --> 14:03.400
I started to lose track.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.360
This place is so big.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.560
You said this guy was some kind of money manager or something.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.600
Hoo-wee!

14:08.600 --> 14:09.960
Must be good in the manage-

14:09.960 --> 14:10.680
money management.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.000
Fuck.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.200
Must be good in the money management.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.240
Hoo-wee!

14:17.240 --> 14:19.160
Must be good money managing that money.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.160
Let's try it again.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.480
Must be good money in managing that money.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.840
Come on, let's get out of here.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.520
We gotta go see Julian.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.080
They make their way toward the garage at this point,

14:33.720 --> 14:35.960
passing rooms that have obviously been picked over.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.800
There's things kind of scattered here and there,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.720
but it's mostly empty rooms at this point.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.440
They walk by a kitchen and there's a guy sprawled on the floor

14:43.160 --> 14:44.200
just in his boxers.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.320
Man, you really whacked him good, big guy.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.760
Yeah, he'll be out for hours.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.080
Right before they get to the garage door,

14:51.080 --> 14:55.480
they see a picture on the wall and it's of a family all-

14:55.480 --> 15:00.680
I'm sorry, he jacked that guy off so good that he passed out for hours?

15:01.320 --> 15:02.360
Really got him.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.160
Whatever you say.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.560
There's a family photo on the wall right by the garage door

15:07.560 --> 15:09.720
of a family in like a fall setting.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.440
Hey, you almost forgot one, dummy.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.400
Even though it's just a picture, there's good money in frames.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.280
We can sell the frame.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.960
They get out to the garage.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.200
They load up the SUV of the homeowner.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.200
Elwood waits in the passenger seat.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.280
Come on, come on, we don't have all day.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.040
Well, I guess we kind of do.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.600
I already snipped the alarms and I took care of the cameras

15:29.480 --> 15:31.960
and the security guy at the gate, you took care of him.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.800
But anyway, I want to get out of here.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.840
Come on, let's go.

15:34.840 --> 15:40.680
Kevin walks out the door with a frame and three double bags.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.360
Everything's just like packed on this dude like a mule.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.880
That's how it was picture made for sure.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.160
Is this happening in the present day or like shortly after that high school game?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.360
No, this is present day.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.240
Yeah, you were daydreaming about that when we were doing this.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.040
That's actually perfect.

16:00.520 --> 16:04.440
They pull up into an old camera shop and they pull around the back.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.640
They've done it a million times before and they're greeted by Julian.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.680
Oh, he's your fence.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.400
He's my fence.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.120
Got you.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.360
Comes out and says, what'd you bring for me today?

16:12.360 --> 16:13.480
Oh, just the usual.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.720
Some vases, socks, books, candlesticks, jewelry, bedsheets.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.720
Kevin, tell some of the keys.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.840
You got your car?

16:20.840 --> 16:21.240
All right.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.800
Julian cuts them off and says, hey, smelly Ellie.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.640
You know I only care about the jewels, right?

16:25.640 --> 16:27.880
You don't have to make me sell people's socks.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.840
They're used.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.120
Elwood replies.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.080
Hey, they still work, don't they?

16:33.080 --> 16:36.040
That means they have value to somebody and that means they have value to me.

16:36.040 --> 16:36.440
Socks.

16:37.160 --> 16:37.720
Socks.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.440
Usually there's even some cash in this frame, I'm sure.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.040
Oh, Elwood, you took the family photos.

16:45.480 --> 16:49.240
He, uh, he assures them that there's going to be, uh, some cash form in a week.

16:49.240 --> 16:49.800
Okay.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.000
After he sells all this stuff.

16:51.000 --> 16:51.400
Yeah.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.640
And, uh, Elwood turns to Kevin and says, all right, let's, uh, let's head back home.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.920
Maybe Ma's made chili.

16:56.920 --> 16:57.640
Oh yeah.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.000
Chili.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.960
So they get back to Elmira Boyd's basement apartment.

17:01.960 --> 17:02.600
Okay.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.560
And oh, they noticed the TV's on.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.200
Oh shit.

17:06.200 --> 17:06.920
She's still awake.

17:06.920 --> 17:07.160
All right.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.040
Come, come, come on.

17:08.600 --> 17:09.240
Is this your mom?

17:10.760 --> 17:12.040
Hey, hey, hey ma.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.400
Um, we're, we're home.

17:13.960 --> 17:14.600
Home.

17:14.600 --> 17:18.680
Uh, Elmira Boyd is laying on the couch in her nightgown and she stirs awake.

17:18.680 --> 17:19.480
Kind of startled.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.320
Oh, did you boys have fun at the golf range?

17:24.760 --> 17:27.800
Uh, Elwood says, yeah, I hit two holes in one.

17:27.800 --> 17:28.440
Hole in one.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.680
She said, well, you keep telling me you should go pro.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.400
I see these guys on TV.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.320
They aren't hitting holes in one every time they go out.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.200
It seems like you do.

17:38.200 --> 17:47.320
Uh, she tousles his greasy mop top and kind of wipes her hand off on her nightgown.

17:48.840 --> 17:49.640
She's going up to bed.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.600
I made some chili.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.960
There's some chili in the fridge there.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.960
Oh, and uh, somebody left that for you.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.720
It's something about an opera.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.680
And uh, when Elwood hears this, his heart skips a beat.

17:58.680 --> 17:59.080
Yeah.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.000
And he turns to his mom.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.360
He's walking up the stairs and says, oh, um, thanks mom.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.400
Um, hey, uh, Kevin and I, we were thinking of taking a trip.

18:07.400 --> 18:12.920
We were, uh, we're going to go to, um, uh, Colorado and hit the, hit the golf courses

18:12.920 --> 18:13.240
out there.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.360
I heard they're beautiful.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.600
We might be, uh, might be gone for a few days.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.040
You have a good night.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.280
And, uh, Elmira says, oh, uh, okay.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.560
You boys have fun out there.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.600
Don't get into any trouble.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.600
He picks up the envelope.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.480
Perfect.

18:27.480 --> 18:27.880
Perfect.

18:27.880 --> 18:28.280
Perfect.

18:30.280 --> 18:30.920
I love that.

18:30.920 --> 18:31.160
Okay.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.720
Can you give me a quick rundown of what your character looks like?

18:33.720 --> 18:37.160
Yeah, he's a greasy and, uh, he's got pimpled and pockmarked face.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.280
He's really, uh, super duper skinny.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.400
He kind of walks around with his arms folded, but at the wrists.

18:44.440 --> 18:44.840
Amazing.

18:45.400 --> 18:50.280
And, uh, yeah, he's wearing a ratty sweater vest and a button up with the collar popping

18:50.280 --> 18:51.720
at the top, but it all looks wrong.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.400
It just looks like it doesn't fit right.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.560
Maybe even the buttons are kind of mismatched.

18:55.560 --> 19:01.800
One year for Christmas, my grandma got me a sweater vest and it was matching the shirt,

19:01.800 --> 19:04.520
the long sleeve dress shirt that would go underneath it.

19:04.520 --> 19:04.760
Right.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.080
Size on these two.

19:07.480 --> 19:13.000
Two items, extra, extra large on the shirt and small on the vest.

19:13.880 --> 19:14.280
Perfect.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.320
Huh?

19:15.320 --> 19:16.120
Did it fit?

19:16.120 --> 19:17.320
You know, neither one did.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.920
It was wrong both directions.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.680
Just mix them together and you'll get the right size.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.760
Yeah, it was, it was an interesting look.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.600
Very puffy in the arms.

19:28.600 --> 19:28.920
All right.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.120
Well, Kevin.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.240
Yes, of course, please.

19:31.240 --> 19:35.880
Kevin, uh, is very large, especially standing next to Elwood.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.440
Certainly.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.600
He's just shy of seven feet tall.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.160
He is hundreds of pounds of, of just muscle.

19:43.160 --> 19:49.400
Like it looks like he works out multiple times a day, but like his skin is kind of like yellowish.

19:49.960 --> 19:55.000
He's got huge, instead of glasses, they're like, like athletic goggles.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.880
Like, you know, they would play in wrapped around his head, makes his eyes look huge.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.880
He just still most comfortable wearing those after wearing them for sports.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.440
Right.

20:04.440 --> 20:09.080
Well, cause he wore them and when he played football and in, in like junior high and high

20:09.080 --> 20:12.280
school, pretty much all he did was play football and hang out with Elwood.

20:13.160 --> 20:18.600
So it just kind of like became comfortable to him, but you can tell, like, just the way he looks,

20:18.600 --> 20:23.000
there's, he's probably got something like genetically wrong with him.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.960
Cause he just like never stopped growing and it's huge.

20:25.960 --> 20:29.400
And his head is kind of like oddly square.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.360
He's an Andre giant.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.680
Or an Alton giant.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.320
Wadler.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.360
Yeah, dude, Robert Wadler guys huge.

20:36.360 --> 20:42.920
And he, uh, he was from a town that was pretty near to where I grew up over by St. Louis.

20:42.920 --> 20:43.420
Yeah.

20:43.960 --> 20:44.840
Huge motherfucker.

20:44.840 --> 20:45.480
That guy.

20:45.480 --> 20:50.920
But yeah, this guy's huge, uh, yellow long sleeve t-shirt blue, like bib overalls.

20:51.480 --> 20:56.520
Uh, those goggles, uh, he's like bald, except for like stealthy bald,

20:56.520 --> 21:01.160
except for like three long stringy hairs that he kind of comes over on his head.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.440
Oh, okay.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.280
So you've been building Homer Simpson.

21:05.000 --> 21:05.400
Yeah.

21:05.400 --> 21:05.800
Yeah.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.520
Homer Simpson.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.640
He's large, but quiet.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.120
All right.

21:10.120 --> 21:10.680
Sick.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.880
Uh, it seems to have kind of a soft voice that repeats.

21:13.880 --> 21:14.440
Yeah.

21:14.440 --> 21:14.920
Boyd's.

21:15.720 --> 21:15.960
Yeah.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.040
He can form full sentences, but doesn't like to a lot.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.280
He likes Elwood speak for him.

21:22.280 --> 21:22.600
Okay.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.320
And even Elwood isn't that great at it.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.440
Well, let's meet someone who should be speaking for the group.

21:30.680 --> 21:30.920
Yeah.

21:30.920 --> 21:35.800
So as Kevin is daydreaming about his football stardom, his, his five glorious

21:35.800 --> 21:42.600
years of high school football of undefeated high school football way, way in the

21:42.600 --> 21:46.920
background of that memory behind the throng of cheering fans, you see Clarissa

21:46.920 --> 21:53.000
Sparrow, short, serious student body president she's managing a small hot dog

21:53.000 --> 21:56.760
stand, the profits from which will benefit a local canine leukemia fund.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.040
She gets visibly flustered at the sophomore work in the stand with her, who

22:00.040 --> 22:04.200
is chatting with some friends instead of boiling dogs, Clarissa snaps to get his

22:04.200 --> 22:06.200
attention and points sharply to station.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.240
She glares at his friends and they sheepishly disperse.

22:09.800 --> 22:14.840
Clarissa takes a deep sigh and massages her temples and then turns around with a

22:14.840 --> 22:15.880
genuine smile.

22:16.040 --> 22:16.760
And she asked for Mrs.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.040
Elmira Boyd's order.

22:18.040 --> 22:18.760
Is there a limit?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.640
I just want to support those sick little doggies as much as I can.

22:21.880 --> 22:22.680
I'm so sorry.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.480
We only have 10 hot and ready at the moment, Mrs.

22:25.480 --> 22:31.720
Boyd, we would have more if everyone was doing their duty, come back in a few

22:31.720 --> 22:33.480
minutes and we'll have as many as you can carry.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.120
I promise.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.560
Oh, thank you, Clarissa.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.760
You're, you're such a darling.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.920
It's so sweet of you to help those pups like this.

22:38.920 --> 22:43.400
Kevin's daydream is reaching its moment of climactic triumph over on the field.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.320
He's, he's spiking the ball.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.680
The crowd's going crazy.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.880
And as, as they erupt cheering, his name,

22:50.120 --> 22:53.480
Clarissa's head kind of darts over inadvertently towards the field.

22:53.480 --> 22:57.480
And the sophomore working with her, it takes that moment to dip away from the

22:57.480 --> 23:00.120
stand and disappear into the crowd with his friends.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.680
She's more hurt than angry.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.120
What makes it so hard for other people to do the right thing?

23:06.840 --> 23:11.640
Work hard, follow the rules, do what is expected, stay true to your word, and

23:11.640 --> 23:12.520
you'll have a good life.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.120
She shakes that thought from her mind and gets back to work.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.400
She shakes that thought from her mind and gets back to work.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.320
There are hot dogs to move.

23:22.200 --> 23:27.320
In the present day, Kevin is snapping out of his daydream as Elmira Boyd offers

23:27.320 --> 23:31.720
him and Elwood the chili and mentions the envelope that came for them.

23:32.680 --> 23:37.080
Elsewhere in the world that night, Agent Clarissa Sparrow, criminal profiler for

23:37.080 --> 23:40.280
the FBI, is coming home to her small one bedroom apartment.

23:40.840 --> 23:44.760
She opens the door and finds an identical envelope slipped under it.

23:44.760 --> 23:49.640
She's currently dressed in a smart, sensible gray pantsuit, and she has the

23:49.640 --> 23:54.040
same smart, sensible haircut she did in Kevin's daydream back in high school.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.880
She's staring intensely at the envelope as a cat comes up and rubs her leg in

23:57.880 --> 24:01.880
greeting, and she thinks about the way she's tried to live her life since then.

24:01.880 --> 24:06.920
Work hard, follow the rules, do what's expected of you, stay true to your word.

24:06.920 --> 24:11.240
She never questioned that that was the right path until her first night at the

24:11.240 --> 24:12.040
opera.

24:12.040 --> 24:15.400
She saw things on that mission that shook her to the core.

24:15.400 --> 24:20.040
The minds of hardened veterans cracked apart under supernatural pressures, the

24:20.040 --> 24:25.800
bodies of innocents torn apart by unnatural forces, and the lies, bribes, and

24:25.800 --> 24:30.920
killings that had taken her and her other agents to conceal the truth that had

24:30.920 --> 24:31.560
been unleashed.

24:32.840 --> 24:38.040
Her composure, though, distinguished her on that first mission, where more

24:38.040 --> 24:42.920
senior agents had lost their minds, she kept it together, and she was soon asked

24:42.920 --> 24:45.400
to move from friendly to agent.

24:46.440 --> 24:51.720
She draws on that composure now, massaging her temples, taking a deep sigh.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.880
She leans down, scratches the cat's ear, and picks up the envelope.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.360
Nice, so we've got our three characters.

24:58.360 --> 25:03.240
Quick, give me a rundown of what Clarissa looks like, and also what is her last

25:03.240 --> 25:03.800
name.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.440
Sparrow.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.840
Oh, Clarissa Sparrow.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.800
I like it.

25:08.120 --> 25:11.240
And what does she look like when we see Clarissa?

25:11.240 --> 25:14.120
Is she still short, serious, and the student body president?

25:14.680 --> 25:17.400
Yes, Clarissa Sparrow.

25:17.400 --> 25:23.640
That's kind of a very subtle, very subtle little nod to Clarissa Starling in Silence

25:23.640 --> 25:24.120
of the Lambs.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.880
And she looks exactly like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.800
Which was playing when I arrived here today.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.280
Research.

25:34.920 --> 25:39.800
I'd never seen Silence of the Lambs, and while we were setting up, I feel like I kind

25:39.800 --> 25:41.400
of watched the whole thing.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.440
You saw most of it.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.320
Pretty much did, yeah.

25:43.320 --> 25:47.800
I saw all the key scenes, I think, that I was like, oh, that's from this.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.640
Yeah, it puts the lotion in the basket.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.440
Would you fuck me?

25:51.160 --> 25:52.360
I'd fuck me.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.000
That was pretty cool.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.640
That was cool, dude.

25:55.640 --> 25:59.080
Yeah, I just want to have that mindset, you know?

25:59.080 --> 26:03.160
Like, are you supposed to be jealous of that character?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.440
That Wild Bill grindset?

26:08.520 --> 26:09.880
Hashtag grindset.

26:09.880 --> 26:15.240
These envelopes that have been left for you summon you to a nearby airport and give you

26:15.240 --> 26:18.120
access to a private aircraft hangar.

26:18.120 --> 26:24.680
And there, you are briefed on this mission by a lone member of the special access group

26:24.680 --> 26:28.840
with identification from the National Reconnaissance Office.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.800
And he introduces himself as John Smith.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.400
You're given file work on the case.

26:35.400 --> 26:41.720
And this case involves a former Delta Green agent named Arvin Chilton.

26:42.280 --> 26:46.920
And Arvin Chilton was a Delta Green agent for a long time.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.920
And then he retired in Ocean City, New Jersey.

26:50.920 --> 26:51.960
Well, hmm.

26:52.520 --> 26:58.520
Recently, it seems, Arvin Chilton has gone on a bit of a murder spree.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.440
His ex-wife is dead.

27:02.440 --> 27:05.560
His ex-wife's partner, new husband, is dead.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.280
His old partner is dead.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.640
There's also a gas station attendant who is dead.

27:14.280 --> 27:21.640
Arvin Chilton was seen on camera stabbing this gas station employee in the back and

27:21.720 --> 27:29.800
then disemboweling him as a car pulled up and filled their tank of gas not five feet

27:29.800 --> 27:32.600
from where this disembowelment was taking place.

27:33.480 --> 27:37.240
The person filling up their tank kind of looks around.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.160
It looks like they're hearing something.

27:39.160 --> 27:45.080
They almost look in the exact direction of Chilton and this dying man.

27:45.080 --> 27:51.080
But then the driver just puts the gas pump back in and gets in their car and drives off.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.160
That's probably what flagged Delta Green the most.

27:57.080 --> 28:04.920
So your three agents are placed on a private aircraft and flown to Woodbine Municipal Airport

28:04.920 --> 28:10.120
in Woodbine, New Jersey, which is approximately five miles from Ocean City, New Jersey,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.040
as well as the apartment of Arvin Chilton.

28:14.760 --> 28:15.400
Excuse me.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.800
Is your name Kevin Gelato?

28:18.520 --> 28:19.020
Yes.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.060
Uh, I don't know if you remember me.

28:22.620 --> 28:23.500
Clarissa Sparrow.

28:24.220 --> 28:26.860
Agent Clarissa Sparrow, FBI.

28:26.860 --> 28:35.820
Kevin kind of looks at her and it cuts to Kevin crying in the bathroom at school and

28:35.820 --> 28:36.620
Clarissa like...

28:37.660 --> 28:42.620
Clarissa, Clarissa, Clarissa is banging on the door and she's like,

28:42.620 --> 28:44.540
I'm sorry, but you need a hall pass.

28:45.980 --> 28:47.420
You didn't have a bathroom pass.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.780
You need to come out immediately.

28:49.100 --> 28:53.180
Kevin comes out and Clarissa like sees he's crying and comforts him.

28:53.180 --> 28:57.260
But yeah, she's like patting him on the back while also writing up a little like,

28:58.380 --> 28:59.820
writing him up with the other hand.

28:59.820 --> 29:00.320
Yeah.

29:00.780 --> 29:05.580
It's like, I understand that this is a tough time in our lives where everybody's got some

29:05.580 --> 29:10.220
hidden battle they don't see, but it only really takes a couple seconds to get that

29:10.220 --> 29:12.540
bathroom pass and the rules are there for a reason.

29:13.420 --> 29:13.920
Thank you.

29:14.880 --> 29:18.960
And he comes back into reality and...

29:20.000 --> 29:21.600
Oh, yeah.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.080
Hi.

29:22.080 --> 29:22.640
Hey.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.280
Hi.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.720
What are you doing here?

29:24.720 --> 29:26.320
I don't have a bathroom pass.

29:28.160 --> 29:28.720
What?

29:28.720 --> 29:30.160
You're the hall monitor.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.440
I'm with the FBI.

29:31.440 --> 29:35.600
I was a hall monitor for all 12 years of my public schooling.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.640
You were the football giant.

29:39.440 --> 29:40.720
Weren't you going to go pro?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.400
Those days are behind him.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.280
Jesus Christ.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.080
The Elwood turns sideways and you finally see him.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.520
Yeah, he leers out from behind the giant.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.000
Oh, look, it's a little birdie.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.240
Elwood Boyd, smelly Ellie.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.280
Good to see you, I guess.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.280
How you been?

30:01.280 --> 30:04.720
I never, I never wrote up anybody more than you.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.400
You sure did seem to have a thing for me.

30:06.400 --> 30:06.880
Yeah.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.080
I had a thing for justice.

30:08.880 --> 30:09.520
I still do.

30:10.160 --> 30:10.960
That's why I'm here.

30:10.960 --> 30:11.520
What?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.120
Why are you two here?

30:13.120 --> 30:13.600
Elwood.

30:15.120 --> 30:15.760
It's his reason.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.880
We're here for a thing.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.240
It's opera night.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.040
Opera.

30:23.040 --> 30:26.960
You two are here for the night at the opera.

30:26.960 --> 30:33.440
You can reach in and find what was left for you in this envelope, which was FBI credentials

30:33.440 --> 30:37.680
that will not hold up for more than, you know, two or three days.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.440
But they'll hold up for a little bit.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.800
Yeah, it looks like we're on the same playing field today.

30:42.800 --> 30:48.000
Clarissa is now terrified because she has actual FBI credentials.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.240
Right.

30:48.240 --> 30:53.040
She knows she's going to have, like, if these two fuck up when she's trying to interact

30:53.040 --> 30:58.480
with real FBI, it's going to mean everything she's worked for could go down the shitter.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.520
Yeah, but hey, they seem on the up and up.

31:04.960 --> 31:11.200
It looks like Kevin and I here possess a set of skills that are indispensable for today.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.280
What do you make of that?

31:13.280 --> 31:17.040
The Delta Green pair, you know, like a character sheet for you.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.000
Any kind of overview.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.160
What skills would those be?

31:23.840 --> 31:29.280
I'm good at getting in the places and I can take things without people seeing that those

31:29.280 --> 31:30.080
things got taken.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.000
I smash.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.120
Okay, so we got a Hulk and a thief.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.560
As much as I'm loathe to admit it, those skills might come in handy.

31:42.560 --> 31:45.120
I reckon you couldn't get by without us.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.200
I reckon I could get by without just about anyone.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.040
But here's the deal.

31:51.040 --> 31:56.560
If you two have to pass as FBI with me, you're going to keep your mouth shut when we're talking

31:56.560 --> 31:57.360
to real FBI.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.200
You're not going to embarrass me.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.200
You're not going to jeopardize what I do outside of this.

32:03.200 --> 32:07.920
In order, I'd say sure, maybe, and we'll see.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.680
Thomas doesn't remember what he just proposed to you, so yeah.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.640
I was like, what is your...

32:16.640 --> 32:18.720
If Elwood likes it, I'll do it.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.800
Yeah, I mean, they summoned us.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.720
They obviously see that we are needed here and we're going to do what we can.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.440
Okay, so she's got your credentials, like the FBI credentials in her hands, and she's

32:29.440 --> 32:31.440
like, consider these hall passes.

32:32.160 --> 32:37.840
This is a privilege and not a right, and it can be revoked at any moment, and she passes

32:37.840 --> 32:38.400
it out to you.

32:40.080 --> 32:40.580
Thanks.

32:41.120 --> 32:51.520
Once you've landed, the pilot actually pops out from the pirate's cabin, which it says

32:51.520 --> 32:58.480
on the door, and he's got a peg leg and a fun three-point hat with the skull and crossbones

32:58.480 --> 32:59.120
on it.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.280
It's themed chartered airplanes.

33:01.280 --> 33:09.520
It's March 25th, which is when this specific company celebrates Halloween, and he says,

33:09.520 --> 33:21.120
argh, there's a car outside waiting for ye, and there's a key, a skeleton key that's on

33:21.120 --> 33:21.600
the wheel.

33:22.240 --> 33:25.440
Thanks for flying our American Airlines.

33:25.520 --> 33:30.720
And so there's a car waiting for you guys.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.760
What kind of car do you want?

33:31.760 --> 33:32.720
A Jaguar.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.160
Okay, there's a Jaguar.

33:37.040 --> 33:43.440
Okay, there's an old shitty used Jaguar waiting for you guys to the point to where like the

33:43.440 --> 33:46.720
mount, like the hood ornament is missing.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.960
This is like a beat up old Jag.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.040
Can I use my mechanic role too?

33:51.680 --> 33:53.120
Which is what we call my uncle.

33:56.320 --> 34:01.360
Kevin would know that on this old Jag, the hood ornament actually pops out.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.520
So can I do a mechanic role to see if I can get it to pop out?

34:05.520 --> 34:06.480
Absolutely you can.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.440
It's broken.

34:12.720 --> 34:18.640
So you guys see this enormous monstrosity in a yellow shirt and blue overalls and these

34:18.640 --> 34:24.240
big thick goggles and three strands of hair walk over to this car and kind of.

34:24.240 --> 34:29.040
Kind of touching where the hood ornament should be and he like pokes it, but his finger

34:29.040 --> 34:30.720
just goes down into the metal.

34:31.360 --> 34:36.880
He poked it way too hard and he like completely destroys where it would pop out.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.880
Just like pressing aluminum foil.

34:38.880 --> 34:42.320
Yeah, like crushing a little tin little coke can.

34:43.440 --> 34:49.040
Kevin gets in the passenger seat of the car and the car just like almost touches the ground

34:49.040 --> 34:50.560
with him in it.

34:50.560 --> 34:59.600
As you guys head off to the Ocean City Police Department, it's currently March 25th, 2016.

34:59.600 --> 35:04.560
The first murder happened on March 21st, so that was four days ago.

35:04.560 --> 35:10.240
It is strange that there's some reason that he looked right directly at it happening and

35:10.240 --> 35:11.760
he didn't do anything about it.

35:11.760 --> 35:12.260
Nothing.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.000
You think maybe he was scared?

35:14.640 --> 35:15.140
Yeah.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.280
Do you think that?

35:17.280 --> 35:22.480
Perhaps there was some sort of optical refraction in the way.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.280
Some natural phenomenon we can't really see getting in the way.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.040
Maybe some kind of glare on the window.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.760
Elwood, you've been reading those magic books.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.800
I don't like.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.300
Maybe.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.160
Is there something like that?

35:37.520 --> 35:41.520
There is nothing in Penn and Teller's How to Do Magic to prepare me for this.

35:41.520 --> 35:42.020
No.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.400
Yeah, I never liked.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.240
It's always made me scared.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.280
I love Penn and Teller.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.640
They are good, aren't they?

35:48.640 --> 35:49.360
They're serious.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.640
He pulled a card out of my ear.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.000
I couldn't feel it in there.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.960
Maybe he's a magician.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.160
I guess maybe some kind of sleight of hand.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.040
He distracted him.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.800
He maybe waved his hand in the air and that's what the guy looked at and then.

36:07.680 --> 36:11.120
And maybe we didn't see that happen because it worked on us too.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.600
Is this your first night at the opera?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.920
No, I've done a couple.

36:16.480 --> 36:22.400
You ever see anything on either of those nights that might be explained by close-up magic?

36:23.520 --> 36:27.600
You think you get one of those envelopes when Penn and Teller are loose?

36:29.200 --> 36:32.560
Well, it says here he was a Delta Green agent.

36:32.560 --> 36:36.560
I assume that they just want us to make sure that all the T's are dotted and the I's are crossed.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.720
Cross your I's.

36:40.800 --> 36:44.160
If he's a magician, he's bad.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.320
He does seem to leave a trail of bodies everywhere he goes.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.800
That's not something that Penn and Teller do as far as I know.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.720
Agent Clarissa puts in some headphones and starts reviewing the files herself.

36:57.360 --> 37:01.200
The Ocean City Police Station is buzzing.

37:01.200 --> 37:04.480
It is an extremely busy day here.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.080
People are running around.

37:06.560 --> 37:12.640
It's around 11 30 a.m. on March 25, 2016.

37:12.640 --> 37:16.480
Someone greets you at the counter as the three of you arrive.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.400
Hell yes, hi.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.040
Special Agent Clarissa Sparrow, FBI.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.960
These are my partners on this particular task force.

37:26.960 --> 37:27.840
She slaps.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.120
Luke is waving.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.920
Kevin starts waving really good.

37:31.920 --> 37:35.680
And Clarissa without even looking just slaps his hand down behind her.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.840
Elwitt's kind of in the back legs kind of cross looking at the floor.

37:39.840 --> 37:44.000
Quinlan and Gambeson are still at lunch, but you can talk to Garza.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.520
Agent Garza from the FBI.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.480
Sorry, he's in the first conference room.

37:48.480 --> 37:49.680
That's where we have him set up.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.080
Thank you.

37:50.080 --> 37:50.800
And she points.

37:51.440 --> 37:56.800
And you see an extremely large man, massively obese in his mid 60s.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.480
He has a graying comb over and a gray suit.

38:00.480 --> 38:07.040
He's wearing a red tie and you see red suspenders are poking out from his suit jacket,

38:07.040 --> 38:10.480
which will not even get close to closing,

38:10.480 --> 38:15.520
like to the point to where you can see both suspenders in full visibility.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.200
And he's just om-nomming a grinder.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.960
He is just going to town.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.960
He's just like, oh, come in, come in, come on in.

38:25.840 --> 38:26.720
Sit down.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.520
You're the FBI?

38:30.480 --> 38:34.000
Sorry, I got to get through this lunch while we're going, if that's cool.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.920
I'm just going to eat while I talk.

38:35.920 --> 38:36.480
Is that good?

38:36.480 --> 38:37.120
You like that?

38:37.120 --> 38:39.200
Elwitt, do you want him to eat while we talk?

38:40.640 --> 38:41.140
Sure.

38:41.440 --> 38:41.760
Good.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.260
Yeah.

38:42.960 --> 38:47.920
He goes, stands up, goes to shake your hand and he's got mayo like all over his fingers.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.880
And he's like, oh shit.

38:48.880 --> 38:54.720
And he rubs it just immediately on his jacket and then reaches his hand back out and says,

38:54.720 --> 38:57.680
Agent Garza, but everybody calls me Uncle Jimmy.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.440
Clarissa nods curtly, does not extend her hand and says,

39:02.160 --> 39:05.600
Agent Clarissa Sparrow, priest to meet you, Agent Garza.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.100
Sparrow.

39:06.960 --> 39:07.600
All right.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.080
Sounds good.

39:08.080 --> 39:08.720
Agent Boyd.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.120
And I firmly grabbed his hand.

39:11.120 --> 39:15.600
And when I pull it away, I do a quick lick of my hand.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.100
Jesus.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.360
Whoa, did you get some of my sandwich in there?

39:19.360 --> 39:20.640
Some of the mayonnaise was on there.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.280
It's fine.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.160
Okay.

39:22.160 --> 39:22.560
All right.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.140
Hi.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.000
Wow.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.120
You're a big fella, aren't you?

39:25.760 --> 39:26.480
Did you play a game?

39:27.360 --> 39:28.880
Those days are behind him though.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.040
I still like to think about it.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.760
I mean, you look like you could go pro any second.

39:33.760 --> 39:34.800
I could have.

39:34.800 --> 39:35.840
What happened?

39:35.840 --> 39:37.200
Elwitt told me not to.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.800
He decided not to.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.720
Yeah, I decided not to.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.560
Well, let's get down to brass tacks here.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.680
And he slams pictures down on the desk in front of you.

39:45.680 --> 39:52.240
Also, quick shout out to Dylan B from Deadwood, South Dakota for the NPC

39:52.240 --> 39:53.440
Uncle Jimmy.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.440
That one is just the TV show.

39:57.280 --> 40:01.760
And Dylan B is a patron at at least our $10 level.

40:01.760 --> 40:06.160
So he gets to create an NPC and a location that might get used.

40:06.160 --> 40:06.960
An empuk.

40:06.960 --> 40:07.680
An empuk.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.200
And this is an empuk.

40:09.200 --> 40:14.640
And so we've got this jovial man who insists that everyone call him uncle,

40:14.640 --> 40:18.080
who is out of breath and sweating with any movement.

40:18.080 --> 40:18.580
Nice.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.320
All right, let's get down.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.960
And he slams these pictures down on the table.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.880
And it is horribly disturbing crime scene photos.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.560
So everyone roll sanity for me.

40:29.360 --> 40:29.860
Pass.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.760
I also pass a 29 on a 45.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.600
I got a 14 on a 45.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.600
72 on an 80.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.160
Oh, wow.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.760
Okay, so everyone 80.

40:39.760 --> 40:40.160
Jesus.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.760
So everyone passes.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.760
You are going to lose no sanity.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.200
You've all seen stuff like this.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.680
And he looks up at your faces.

40:47.680 --> 40:52.320
And then he looks back down at these bloody violent pictures

40:52.320 --> 40:56.160
where this normal home has been completely torn up.

40:56.160 --> 41:01.680
And the two victims are missing their eyes and tongues.

41:02.240 --> 41:07.120
Blood is covering the faces and splattering the ground behind them.

41:07.120 --> 41:12.160
And the woman, Eileen McCarty, the ex-wife of Arvin Chilton,

41:12.160 --> 41:16.400
is basically it's impossible to tell who she is.

41:16.400 --> 41:20.640
And even her husband, it's impossible to really make out their faces,

41:20.640 --> 41:24.640
because without an eyes and with all this blood covering bruises,

41:24.640 --> 41:29.520
without eyes, without eyes, it's going to be hard to recognize these folks.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.640
And he slams down.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.360
He goes down.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.200
You see anything crazy out of the ordinary?

41:33.200 --> 41:35.120
You looked at all this information.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.160
You saw there's no sign of forced entry.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.680
Clearly, a neighbor even saw the husband and wife

41:41.680 --> 41:43.840
let this ex-husband into their house.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.760
You saw the weapon.

41:45.760 --> 41:48.560
It was this large hook knife, I guess.

41:49.120 --> 41:53.200
But me personally, if you're asking me, which you are,

41:53.840 --> 41:56.240
I don't think that that body...

41:56.240 --> 41:59.600
And he points at this just destroyed face.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.400
I don't think that that's Eileen McCarty.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.800
What reason do you have to believe that that's not Eileen McCarty?

42:06.800 --> 42:16.320
Eileen McCarty was seen by witnesses in New York state on March 23rd at a gas station.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.040
When was this picture taken?

42:19.040 --> 42:20.320
That was March 21st.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.440
That was the day of the murder.

42:22.160 --> 42:25.360
Medical examiner said, you know, torture, death.

42:25.920 --> 42:30.320
The torture was prolonged, extremely violent, obviously.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.840
And he taps really hard and gets mayonnaise all over the pictures

42:33.840 --> 42:35.120
that he's put out on this desk.

42:37.040 --> 42:37.920
But I'm not worried.

42:37.920 --> 42:38.480
I'm not worried.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.120
You guys are here.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.800
You guys are here to take care of everything.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.280
And I understand that we needed reinforcements on this thing.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.560
It's already been three days.

42:44.560 --> 42:45.920
Everything's up in the air right now.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.320
Everyone's pretty fucking confused.

42:48.320 --> 42:52.560
But I think one of three things is going to happen.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.520
He's either going to use his credit card, which we've tagged.

42:55.520 --> 42:59.280
He's going to get pulled over or ticketed in a known car.

42:59.280 --> 43:03.280
Or he's just going to overplay his hand in some other way.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.680
He's going to make a mistake and then we'll get him.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.640
He's a desperate man.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.680
Desperate man make desperate moves.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.080
And that allows for reasonable people to catch him.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.520
Is the footage from the gas station,

43:17.520 --> 43:20.400
is that his last known appearance for us?

43:20.400 --> 43:21.200
Yeah.

43:21.200 --> 43:21.440
Yeah.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.520
It's the last time we saw him.

43:23.520 --> 43:29.200
Also, that gas station, I think, and he like picks around at some of his notes.

43:29.200 --> 43:33.760
He's like, yeah, actually that gas station is where?

43:33.760 --> 43:34.480
Eileen.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.400
Eileen McCarty was seen the same day of that murder.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.240
She was seen there.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.480
Eileen McCarty was seen at the same gas station

43:42.480 --> 43:44.720
where that attendant was brutally murdered by.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.040
Yeah.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.120
And two days after she supposedly died.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.400
According to what witnesses?

43:48.400 --> 43:49.440
Multiple witnesses.

43:50.720 --> 43:51.280
Who?

43:51.280 --> 43:51.840
Multiple.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.520
Is that all you, Zach Note?

43:57.520 --> 43:58.960
Multiple witnesses.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.200
What do you want to know?

44:01.200 --> 44:04.240
What do you want to know if they're like smart, if they could see?

44:04.880 --> 44:10.560
I want to know why people in not her state at a gas station could identify her.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.320
We were showing photos.

44:12.320 --> 44:16.720
Have we identified the person on that footage that pulled up to the gas station?

44:16.720 --> 44:18.240
No, the one who left, no.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.360
But we did identify the guy who died.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.800
His name was Quentin Harris, who's 59.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.920
Do you think the guy in the car that drove off did it?

44:27.920 --> 44:29.680
Well, no.

44:29.680 --> 44:30.240
No.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.480
Cause it's on tape.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.360
It's Arvin Chilton.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.080
You saw it.

44:35.040 --> 44:35.360
Yeah.

44:36.000 --> 44:36.880
Okay.

44:36.880 --> 44:37.200
Yeah.

44:37.200 --> 44:38.000
You saw that, right?

44:38.560 --> 44:39.280
Yeah.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.240
Do you want to watch it again?

44:41.120 --> 44:43.120
No, he's well aware.

44:43.120 --> 44:44.080
He's testing you.

44:44.080 --> 44:47.040
He's got an interesting investigative mind.

44:47.040 --> 44:52.400
But why don't you save the mind games for Kevin is extremely confused, but just nods

44:52.400 --> 44:53.520
his head and agrees.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.960
Was Eileen McCarty seen at the gas station before or after the murder?

44:58.960 --> 44:59.840
Before.

44:59.840 --> 45:00.640
How long before?

45:01.360 --> 45:03.200
He picks through a couple more notes.

45:03.200 --> 45:08.960
Mayo is just spreading throughout, slowly getting on everything.

45:08.960 --> 45:15.200
If any of those drops kind of come near Elwood, he's wiping a finger up and tasting it.

45:15.200 --> 45:22.000
Oh, uncle Jimmy looks over at Clarissa and is just like, how long have you three been

45:22.000 --> 45:22.720
working together?

45:23.280 --> 45:24.960
This partnership is very recent.

45:24.960 --> 45:25.460
Hmm.

45:26.400 --> 45:27.360
I'm sorry.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.120
He's been my friend a long time.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.400
Yeah, I get that.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.760
I see that in the two of you.

45:31.760 --> 45:32.400
All right.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.520
So, yeah, if you want any phone records, there's really not much there.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.400
We've got it tracked and an alert is set on it.

45:38.400 --> 45:42.640
So if he makes any phone calls, we're going to know about it.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.320
And I think that's how we're going to get him.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.520
Nothing out of sorts.

45:47.520 --> 45:51.680
He did call Eileen on the morning of March 16th.

45:51.680 --> 45:54.480
So that's five days pre death.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.760
Supposed death of Eileen McCarty.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.760
Did we try just calling him?

45:59.760 --> 46:00.160
Yeah.

46:00.160 --> 46:00.960
What happened?

46:00.960 --> 46:01.920
He didn't pick up.

46:01.920 --> 46:02.880
Can I try?

46:02.880 --> 46:04.400
No, I mean, sure.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.360
You can if you want.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.080
I don't care.

46:06.080 --> 46:06.400
Yes.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.680
I dialed the phone number.

46:08.720 --> 46:09.360
Okay.

46:09.360 --> 46:12.400
Did you learn about that March 16th call from phone records?

46:12.400 --> 46:12.880
Yeah.

46:12.880 --> 46:15.520
How long did they indicate that that phone call lasted?

46:15.520 --> 46:17.520
Two minutes, one second.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.880
71 seconds.

46:18.880 --> 46:20.560
Oh, 71 is wrong.

46:20.560 --> 46:21.060
Huh.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.960
121.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.760
No, math was never my strong suit.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.920
Uncle Jimmy's good at a lot of stuff.

46:27.920 --> 46:28.720
Math ain't it?

46:28.720 --> 46:29.220
Ha.

46:29.620 --> 46:34.660
Did you have many nieces and nephews, Agent Garza?

46:35.220 --> 46:37.620
Yeah, four.

46:37.620 --> 46:38.660
What are their full names?

46:38.660 --> 46:39.220
What do they do?

46:40.420 --> 46:43.060
Where were they on March 23rd?

46:43.700 --> 46:44.200
Why?

46:44.740 --> 46:46.580
Anything that can help.

46:46.580 --> 46:47.060
It's weird.

46:47.060 --> 46:47.540
Didn't you say?

46:47.540 --> 46:50.420
We've also got credit card tracking info.

46:50.420 --> 46:55.380
It's completely normal until March 20th, day before the first murder.

46:55.380 --> 46:58.020
Becomes irregular and then ceases.

46:58.820 --> 46:59.940
What does that mean?

46:59.940 --> 47:02.260
Yeah, it got weird and then stopped.

47:02.260 --> 47:03.060
Like what?

47:03.060 --> 47:08.180
Yeah, basically he was clearly using the card not in Ocean City.

47:08.180 --> 47:14.020
The card was being used up toward New York and then it just stops.

47:14.020 --> 47:18.420
So it's clear that he used it, then committed the murder, hasn't used it since.

47:18.420 --> 47:19.860
And what was his last call?

47:21.540 --> 47:22.020
Let's see.

47:22.660 --> 47:23.940
Go to the last page.

47:23.940 --> 47:25.300
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

47:26.180 --> 47:29.380
Yeah, it goes to Alexander Duchesne.

47:30.340 --> 47:31.780
What do we know about him?

47:31.780 --> 47:33.380
He's the landlord.

47:34.020 --> 47:34.980
Of Chilton?

47:34.980 --> 47:37.060
Yeah, he's Arvin Chilton's landlord.

47:37.060 --> 47:38.980
Alexander Duchesne, old guy.

47:38.980 --> 47:40.180
How long did that call last?

47:40.900 --> 47:47.060
That call was 29 seconds or zero minutes and 29 seconds.

47:47.060 --> 47:48.820
Have we talked to him?

47:48.820 --> 47:49.860
Quick math.

47:49.860 --> 47:51.140
Have we talked to Duchesne?

47:51.140 --> 47:52.660
Yeah, we've talked to Duchesne.

47:52.660 --> 47:53.620
What did he say?

47:53.620 --> 47:54.980
Talked to him on the 23rd.

47:55.860 --> 47:59.220
He said that Arvin's been living with him for five years.

47:59.220 --> 48:00.740
Arvin lives upstairs.

48:01.460 --> 48:06.420
It's like one of those houses where just the upstairs is an apartment.

48:06.420 --> 48:10.660
It's got an external doorway, stairs on the outside.

48:11.300 --> 48:15.060
Gone up there into Arvin's apartment, but downstairs is where the old man lives.

48:15.700 --> 48:16.420
I don't know, man.

48:16.420 --> 48:17.380
Seems like a shut-in.

48:18.180 --> 48:22.580
When Eileen was at that gas station, was that the Quinlan on duty at that time?

48:22.580 --> 48:24.500
Does she have contact with Quinlan?

48:24.500 --> 48:26.340
Uh, yeah, let's look.

48:26.340 --> 48:29.940
And he'll flip through some video and...

48:33.220 --> 48:33.860
Oh, no.

48:35.940 --> 48:36.660
Oh, wow.

48:36.660 --> 48:37.140
Yeah, no.

48:38.100 --> 48:40.580
All the inside tapes must have gotten taken.

48:41.220 --> 48:42.020
Bye.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.380
That's really weird.

48:43.380 --> 48:44.100
Who took him?

48:45.220 --> 48:48.740
No, I mean, like, we never got him and he's flipping through and he's looking.

48:48.740 --> 48:49.940
Yeah, they were never checked in.

48:49.940 --> 48:52.740
Clarissa gives a little cough and she says,

48:52.740 --> 48:55.380
Can I speak with my associates in the hallway for one moment?

48:55.380 --> 49:00.180
Yeah, actually, I'm really busy here as he, like, finishes this huge sandwich.

49:00.180 --> 49:03.620
There's a third of it left and he just shoves the entire thing in his mouth.

49:03.620 --> 49:06.180
And he's like, I'll wrap up here.

49:06.180 --> 49:11.220
And so if you guys want to head over to Chilton's and just kind of get lay of the land,

49:12.100 --> 49:17.860
I'm sure you can talk to, uh, when, uh, uh, what are their names?

49:17.940 --> 49:20.980
Quinlan and Gambeson, the PDs around here.

49:22.100 --> 49:24.740
They'll be back after lunch and you can talk to them.

49:25.300 --> 49:28.260
But yeah, go ahead and just head on out and we'll talk.

49:28.260 --> 49:29.780
We'll catch up later if you want.

49:29.780 --> 49:31.380
But he has seen the video.

49:31.380 --> 49:31.780
He has.

49:32.340 --> 49:33.700
He's very confused by it.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.060
It doesn't make any sense to him.

49:35.060 --> 49:36.660
And so that's all.

49:36.660 --> 49:39.220
He passed his sanity check and he's like,

49:40.180 --> 49:40.980
Yeah, I don't know.

49:40.980 --> 49:41.780
People are strange.

49:41.780 --> 49:44.260
The guy probably didn't want to be caught up in anything.

49:44.260 --> 49:45.620
Just needed to get away.

49:45.620 --> 49:47.220
You know, the bystander effect.

49:47.220 --> 49:49.700
He honestly probably had a little pot on him.

49:49.700 --> 49:52.020
You know, a lot of them do.

49:52.020 --> 49:52.820
Yeah.

49:52.820 --> 49:53.940
Bystanders.

49:53.940 --> 49:54.580
Yeah.

49:54.580 --> 49:57.380
Bystanders typically more like high standards.

49:57.380 --> 49:58.180
Am I right?

49:58.180 --> 49:59.700
That's very funny, Agent Garza.

49:59.700 --> 50:00.180
Thank you.

50:00.180 --> 50:02.260
Uh, Uncle Jimmy, you can call me Uncle Jimmy.

50:04.020 --> 50:06.900
This was, um, thank you for your assistance, Agent Garza.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.860
Thanks for coming.

50:07.860 --> 50:08.260
All right.

50:08.260 --> 50:08.980
Uh, yeah.

50:08.980 --> 50:10.020
Holler if you need anything.

50:10.020 --> 50:11.140
Here's my phone number.

50:11.140 --> 50:12.420
Here's my card.

50:12.420 --> 50:14.340
I'll be here or I'll be elsewhere.

50:15.220 --> 50:16.580
Isn't that how it always goes?

50:16.580 --> 50:17.780
Where are you guys staying?

50:17.780 --> 50:18.820
You have a pleasant evening.

50:18.820 --> 50:19.140
Okay.

50:21.220 --> 50:23.380
When you guys pull up to Arvin Chilton's apartment,

50:23.380 --> 50:27.860
it is literally half a mile from the police station.

50:27.860 --> 50:29.620
This neighborhood is really nice.

50:29.620 --> 50:33.380
It's just this like March 20, what is it?

50:33.380 --> 50:34.180
March 25th.

50:34.180 --> 50:34.820
Shit.

50:34.820 --> 50:35.620
March 25th.

50:35.620 --> 50:37.780
It's a beautiful sunny day.

50:38.500 --> 50:43.540
Big fluffers are up in the clouds and blue skies.

50:43.540 --> 50:48.420
All of these buildings have like white trim on the columns

50:48.420 --> 50:52.980
and the stairwells and the, the, uh, what are these Thomas?

50:52.980 --> 50:53.860
Braillings.

50:53.860 --> 50:54.740
Like a railing.

50:54.740 --> 50:55.060
Yeah.

50:55.060 --> 50:57.380
Like railings are all, uh, white.

50:57.380 --> 50:59.860
You pull up to a cute little baby blue home.

50:59.860 --> 51:01.140
It's two stories.

51:01.140 --> 51:07.380
And like Uncle Jimmy said, there is a staircase on the left side of this house

51:07.380 --> 51:13.860
that leads up to a tiny little duplex up above this tiny little home.

51:14.580 --> 51:18.500
And you guys pull up at about 1230 PM.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.420
It's about 1230 PM.

51:22.500 --> 51:24.340
We've just arrived at the home of...

51:24.340 --> 51:27.300
Are you like talking into a voice recorder?

51:27.300 --> 51:30.180
Are you, uh, are you going to be taking notes this whole time?

51:30.820 --> 51:33.460
Does that make you uncomfortable, Mr. Boyd?

51:33.460 --> 51:36.900
I feel like we need to be careful about what kind of records we keep on

51:36.900 --> 51:37.780
a case like this.

51:37.780 --> 51:38.980
Yeah, we need to be careful.

51:40.100 --> 51:41.140
You're absolutely right.

51:41.140 --> 51:47.460
But I have to keep some official records since we are technically investigating this for the FBI.

51:47.460 --> 51:49.620
There has to be the official cover and then...

51:49.620 --> 51:52.180
And then every now and then it switches off.

51:52.180 --> 51:53.060
Wink, wink.

51:53.060 --> 51:54.580
You roughly get the idea.

51:54.580 --> 51:55.140
Yeah.

51:55.140 --> 52:00.260
Kevin walks up the stairs and knocks on the door and it like shakes the home.

52:00.260 --> 52:04.420
With every step of these shaky old stairs,

52:04.420 --> 52:07.940
this thing is like almost giving way under Kevin.

52:08.580 --> 52:11.060
And when you get up there, you see a sign on the door.

52:11.060 --> 52:11.860
Taped up.

52:11.860 --> 52:15.060
Police investigation ongoing.

52:15.060 --> 52:16.180
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

52:16.180 --> 52:16.900
Nonsense.

52:16.900 --> 52:20.100
Agent Garza gave you keys to children's apartment.

52:20.100 --> 52:20.740
What's going on?

52:20.740 --> 52:24.500
And there is a light on in the downstairs apartment.

52:24.500 --> 52:30.100
Yeah, Kevin's hands are a little too big to really functionally use a key.

52:30.100 --> 52:31.380
So he steps back and...

52:31.780 --> 52:38.020
Sorry, I had you be a thief and then I gave you keys to get in.

52:38.020 --> 52:38.900
That's my bad, Joe.

52:39.780 --> 52:41.780
Yeah, that was the only time this was going to come in handy.

52:43.380 --> 52:46.260
He was pulling out the lockpick set from his back pocket and then saw

52:47.300 --> 52:51.060
Agent Sparrows put a key in the door and it just deflates even more.

52:53.460 --> 52:56.500
I guess we're still waiting for that skill set to come in use.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.180
There will be a time, I'm sure of it.

52:58.260 --> 53:03.940
Perhaps this whole mission will be the time that you learn that your criminal ways will not pay.

53:04.580 --> 53:07.940
I mean, they paid for most of the things in my life so far.

53:08.980 --> 53:10.260
They paid pretty good.

53:10.260 --> 53:14.340
She turns on you and is brandishing the key in your face and she's like,

53:14.980 --> 53:18.420
no, sir, you will receive your come up,

53:18.420 --> 53:22.340
but I'm willing to work with your kind against these unnatural forces.

53:22.340 --> 53:23.860
Don't do that to him.

53:23.860 --> 53:29.620
And Kevin's standing there like pushing away the threatening key from Elvit's face.

53:30.580 --> 53:33.060
All right then, as long as we understand each other and

53:33.940 --> 53:39.140
Clarissa is genuinely very intimidated by the Robert Wadlow man.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.020
Yeah, who wouldn't be?

53:42.020 --> 53:42.740
Are you okay?

53:44.260 --> 53:45.620
Thanks for having my back there, Kevin.

53:46.420 --> 53:46.900
I'm fine.

53:46.900 --> 53:47.700
Thank you.

53:47.700 --> 53:49.460
I was a little worried.

53:49.460 --> 53:53.620
It's a 640 square foot apartment.

53:53.620 --> 53:56.740
This looks like about a 640 square feet.

53:57.620 --> 54:00.740
Right here must be tens of dollars.

54:00.740 --> 54:02.180
So you walk into the bedroom.

54:02.180 --> 54:05.060
Like when you open up the door, you're walking into the studio.

54:05.060 --> 54:09.860
It's a bedroom and there's one door to the bathroom all around.

54:09.860 --> 54:11.220
There's a record collection.

54:11.220 --> 54:13.220
There's a bunch of Elvis Presley.

54:13.220 --> 54:17.940
There's a bookshelf filled with the works of the immortal bard himself, William Shakespeare,

54:18.660 --> 54:26.100
as well as a DVD collection that shows he did not shy away from the film adaptations.

54:26.100 --> 54:28.820
And there's really not much else around here.

54:28.820 --> 54:31.780
So he's got like these Shakespeares and some books

54:31.780 --> 54:35.300
and then also DVD copies of just those same plays and books.

54:36.180 --> 54:38.340
Is there a computer anywhere near here?

54:38.340 --> 54:40.100
There is not a computer, no.

54:40.100 --> 54:41.620
Well, it looks like there's nothing to see here.

54:41.620 --> 54:42.900
Let's move on to the next place.

54:43.460 --> 54:45.540
Everybody roll alertness for me.

54:48.340 --> 54:49.540
Critical success.

54:49.540 --> 54:50.740
55 on an 80.

54:50.740 --> 54:51.940
A regular success.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.380
A 30 on a 70.

54:53.380 --> 54:54.740
I got a 97.

54:54.740 --> 54:55.140
Okay.

54:55.140 --> 54:57.620
So Kevin is completely startled.

54:58.340 --> 55:04.820
Boyd, Elwood, Elwood Boyd is not startled.

55:04.820 --> 55:12.420
You see this coming, but before you even see anyone creeping up behind you

55:12.420 --> 55:16.260
and kind of like putting themselves around the doorway,

55:16.900 --> 55:24.740
Clarissa, you smell old bandages in the air.

55:26.260 --> 55:32.740
The odor is strong enough for you to immediately turn around.

55:32.740 --> 55:34.820
She turns around and expects to find a mummy.

55:36.740 --> 55:40.180
Expecting a mummy, you see Alexander Duchesne.

55:40.180 --> 55:43.220
He is 79 years of age.

55:43.220 --> 55:47.780
He is around five foot six, 210 pounds.

55:47.780 --> 55:48.740
An old man.

55:48.740 --> 55:54.340
He has carefully quaffed white hair and he has heavy black glasses.

55:54.340 --> 56:00.900
He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.

56:01.860 --> 56:08.900
And he has a long winding scar up the right half of his face.

56:08.900 --> 56:15.940
It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries,

56:15.940 --> 56:22.500
just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose.

56:22.500 --> 56:26.260
And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain,

56:26.260 --> 56:29.380
as he kind of like pops his head around the side and is like,

56:32.820 --> 56:34.020
More officers.

56:34.900 --> 56:36.500
Hello, more officers.

56:36.900 --> 56:37.700
Hello, there.

56:37.700 --> 56:42.020
Before he can, he's like coming up the stairs into the doorway behind us.

56:42.020 --> 56:42.980
Yeah, he's right there.

56:42.980 --> 56:47.060
Before he can like get in, Clarissa is advancing like with her badge out and she says,

56:47.060 --> 56:52.020
Special Agent Clarissa Sparrow, sir, this is an act of crime scene investigation.

56:52.020 --> 56:54.020
You were compromising that crime scene.

56:54.020 --> 56:55.300
Are you Mr. Duchesne?

56:55.300 --> 56:58.100
Oh, I'm so sorry, yeah, yeah, I'm Mr. Duchesne.

56:58.100 --> 56:59.860
I'm going to have to ask you to go back downstairs.

56:59.860 --> 57:03.940
Slowly, he raises his hands in the air with a wry smile and he's like,

57:04.900 --> 57:06.340
Sorry, sorry.

57:07.540 --> 57:09.860
Sir, we're going to come speak to you in a moment, please.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.140
Okay, please do, come on.

57:11.140 --> 57:12.260
Please wait for us downstairs.

57:12.260 --> 57:13.060
Whenever you're ready.

57:13.060 --> 57:13.700
Yes, fine.

57:13.700 --> 57:14.180
That's fine.

57:14.180 --> 57:19.220
And he slowly creeps back around and like you can almost hear his bones creaking

57:19.860 --> 57:24.500
with the pain look on his face as he turns around and it's like, okay.

57:24.500 --> 57:30.900
And just kind of waves one hand up in the air as his other hand grabs the rail like intensely.

57:30.900 --> 57:32.340
Kevin waves back at him.

57:32.340 --> 57:33.780
And he heads back down the stairs.

57:34.020 --> 57:34.520
Really?

57:35.540 --> 57:36.980
That was a landlord.

57:36.980 --> 57:41.620
Elwood wants to, um, clock this apartment for things that, uh, might be valuable.

57:41.620 --> 57:42.020
Oh, okay.

57:42.020 --> 57:42.420
Yeah, yeah.

57:42.420 --> 57:45.380
Go ahead and roll search for criminology.

57:46.100 --> 57:46.900
Yeah, absolutely.

57:47.540 --> 57:48.500
This is what you guys do.

57:49.540 --> 57:50.180
Fuck.

57:50.180 --> 57:52.820
I critically fail either one.

57:52.820 --> 57:56.260
I've got a 60 criminology and I rolled a 77.

57:56.260 --> 58:02.900
There's a Shakespeare play inside the book has a pamphlet.

58:02.900 --> 58:06.260
Like you would receive when you went and actually saw a play.

58:06.260 --> 58:07.140
What are those called?

58:07.140 --> 58:07.860
A play bill.

58:07.860 --> 58:08.500
Play bill.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.620
A play bill.

58:09.620 --> 58:15.780
When you, when you flick through some of these, these books, this play bill pops out and you

58:15.780 --> 58:23.860
are dead fucking certain that a, this is from an early original, like one of the first American

58:23.860 --> 58:26.180
runs of this Shakespeare production.

58:26.180 --> 58:27.860
This is a globe theater play bill.

58:27.860 --> 58:36.660
And it's like signed by some important director who signed by John Wilkes Booth.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.980
It's signed by John Wilkes Booth.

58:38.980 --> 58:40.340
Wasn't his brother an actor?

58:40.980 --> 58:44.660
I think as was, he was a very famous actor.

58:44.660 --> 58:50.180
And so you are dead fucking positive that this is going to bring in at least like 10

58:50.180 --> 58:50.740
grand.

58:50.740 --> 58:52.020
I pocket it.

58:52.020 --> 58:54.100
I try to do it feefully.

58:54.100 --> 58:54.980
Oh, you don't.

58:54.980 --> 58:55.940
They both see you.

58:56.820 --> 58:58.340
Oh, I see you get that.

58:58.340 --> 59:03.540
And I just like grab a random book and put it in my back pocket.

59:05.380 --> 59:05.940
What the hell?

59:05.940 --> 59:06.420
What?

59:06.420 --> 59:08.660
What are you grabbing evidence for?

59:08.660 --> 59:10.420
It's signed by John Wilkes Booth.

59:10.420 --> 59:12.100
This gets a pretty penny.

59:12.100 --> 59:14.340
I grab it from her hands.

59:16.740 --> 59:20.580
All right, let's do a dexterity competition.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.300
No, you're not in this.

59:23.300 --> 59:23.940
Crit fail.

59:23.940 --> 59:25.140
Oh my God.

59:25.140 --> 59:26.340
Regular fail.

59:26.340 --> 59:29.620
All right, well, that still means that we rip the book in half.

59:29.620 --> 59:31.780
Yeah, you 100% rip the book in half.

59:34.020 --> 59:36.100
Oh, no, I thought at least it's all its value.

59:36.100 --> 59:38.020
Oh God, you did this.

59:38.740 --> 59:39.380
You did this.

59:39.940 --> 59:43.620
A little tear starts to form at the edge of Kevin's eye.

59:43.620 --> 59:44.980
Damn it, Kevin.

59:44.980 --> 59:46.020
It wasn't your fault.

59:46.020 --> 59:46.660
He did this.

59:47.780 --> 59:48.260
He start.

59:50.020 --> 59:52.580
You two, you keep your hands to yourself.

59:53.380 --> 59:54.740
Stand right in the middle of this room.

59:55.460 --> 59:56.340
Don't touch anything else.

59:56.340 --> 59:59.380
Elwood kind of rolls his eyes, but also looks at Kevin like,

01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.020
that sounds like she knows what she's doing.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:07.940
Now let me use my investigators eyes to search this room.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.660
Do it.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.180
35, success.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:10.740
Nice.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.500
You find there's a record collection with a bunch of Elvis Presley.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:20.340
There's a bookshelf filled with the works of the immortal bard himself, William Shakespeare,

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.580
one of which is torn in half on the floor.

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:28.980
And you also see a DVD collection that shows he did not shy away from the film adaptations.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.180
Everything appears to be as it seems in this room.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.940
Should we go rough up the landlord?

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.860
If it comes to that, of course, Kevin, that just can't be our immediate.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.540
We're on official business here.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.900
And he says that kind of sarcastically with an eye toward Sparrow.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.620
Sparrow doesn't catch that and she like nods in approval.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:50.740
That's right.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:53.220
Okay.

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.820
I'll put my mean face on.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:00.900
And his face turns mean, but it actually is like kind of scary.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:07.540
Like the happy, dumb smile goes to like a serious, like zoned in face and idea roll.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.100
Yeah.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.180
For some, for anything we might be missing here.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.060
Yeah, sure.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:15.300
What is that based off of intelligence pass 62 on a 70.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.060
You have cleaned this room.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.140
Like it is, it has been clocked.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:23.780
You have garnered all the information you are going to get from Arvin Chilton's apartment.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:25.780
I believe we've gathered everything we can here.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.540
Let's go at this time.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:31.060
Let's go talk with Mr. Dushane.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:33.620
That does seem like the next course of action.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.340
After you.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.100
No, no, I insist after you.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.940
I start clomping down the stairs.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.100
As you're clomping down the stairs, you actually hear coming out of the basement,

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.980
not even basement, just the first floor apartment of this two story duplex.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.260
This, uh, this high wine.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.540
Is he making us tea?

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.740
Yeah, he's making you tea.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.220
That's nice.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:12.740
Okay, the entire house shakes and you hear a coughing fit from inside.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:25.220
Just this coming, coming, coming, and the door opens and you see this man.

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.580
It's the same man as before.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.460
And he's, he's wearing the same clothes.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.380
It's crazy.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:35.060
And this close to him, you're overwhelmed by his odor.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.660
He smells really bad.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.860
And for the two of you who didn't smell it earlier, it's like old bandages bad.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.380
And he seems to have a cold.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.420
He's like coughing and he's just like sniffling a bunch.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.820
He invites you inside really eagerly.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.580
He's just like, come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:50.900
Okay.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.580
Um, I have tea.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.260
I have tea for you guys.

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.140
If you want tea, um, I've put out some, some plates.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:57.940
I've got some more food.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.740
Here's some chairs.

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.340
You can sit here and here.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.900
Um, your, your name was Sparrow, right?

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.460
Agent Sparrow.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:06.660
I pass him my FBI card.

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:07.060
Perfect.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.340
And do you guys have cards too?

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.420
No, they're just getting theirs made up.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.060
Unfortunately.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.020
Oh, okay.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.140
Sorry.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:17.640
Sorry.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.020
I'll wash my hands real quick.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.100
He goes back and starts washing his hands.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:29.220
And you see, uh, looking around this place, you see a very sad home decorated by an old

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.060
man with no relatives.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:35.860
There's an ashtray on the table and it hasn't been used.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.820
It's clean.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.460
There's a bunch of rolled up newspapers in a bucket.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.740
A few mops are in the corner of the room strangely.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:46.100
And there's an odd number of baseballs placed around.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:55.060
There's a copy of as you like it sitting on the coffee table and he brings out a spread.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:01.460
I mean, just like a charcutte, but like the way a 79 year old shut in would, would bring

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.580
you charcutte.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.620
And so it's just these like charcutte cold cuts.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.100
Oh, it's charcutte as hell.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.260
The charcutte is good.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.780
It's cold cuts and some cheeses.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:20.660
And then there's a bowl on the plate with some big olives on it, green and black olives.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:29.460
And he sits down and he's just like, I'm sorry, he screams as he eases into a chair that you

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.860
think is like the only place where he sits.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:37.380
Elwood wants to put a grimy finger into the olive bowl and pick up a bunch.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.060
Like as he's setting it down.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:39.940
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.500
He's already.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:41.940
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:44.020
Please, please eat up, eat up.

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.260
Pretty sure I know what kind of maniac Joe took before this game started.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:48.500
Yeah.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:54.020
As soon as Kevin sees Elwood doing that, he's grabbing some stuff off the board, but it's

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.380
like one handful is like half of the stuff on there.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.860
And he's just like, dig in, dig in.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.500
Agent Sparrow, dig in.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.420
I'm going to grab some tea for everyone.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.980
And he goes in and no tea for me, please.

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.340
Chocolate milk.

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:09.460
I do.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.460
I love chocolate milk.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.700
Who doesn't love chocolate milk?

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:14.980
Just make that too.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:15.700
Thank you.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.060
Two chocolate milks.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.260
And you hear him rummaging in the fridge for a while.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.060
Can I do a search?

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.060
Can someone else do a search of this room?

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.260
I'd like to clock.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.700
I'd like to clock around the room.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:28.180
Yeah.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.700
Oh, crit success.

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.380
Oh, 33 again.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.540
Regular pass with a 16.

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.260
Okay.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:39.860
With a regular pass, you think that the baseballs are placed very strangely around this room.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.100
And why does an old man have a bunch of baseballs hanging around?

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.460
They're like a distinct pattern.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:46.980
No, not really.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.500
What about to me?

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.780
Roll SIGINT, I guess.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:51.860
No, it's a fail.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.220
It's an 89 on a 40.

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.260
Yeah, that ain't going to do it.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.700
And then with the crit success, you note he has a copy of As You Like It.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:00.100
For me, what is that?

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.620
Which is written by Shakespeare.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:01.860
Yeah.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:02.580
Okay.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:02.980
Okay.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.500
So that's what I wanted to ask about.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.780
Does this copy of As You Like It look like it came from one of the sets upstairs?

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.580
Yeah, totally.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.900
Same printing, same publishing company.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.220
Yeah.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.900
Clarissa is picking it up and is holding it and waiting for him to get back in the room.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:15.300
Cool.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.300
Kevin's like, he likes Shakespeare too?

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:23.700
So he comes back in with tea for himself and chocolate milk for Elwood and Kevin.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:29.620
And then he looks at Agent Sparrow and he's like, seriously, dig in.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:30.900
Hey, thanks.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.340
Are you a thief too?

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.940
So she's holding the book, she says.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.860
Complete works of William Shakespeare.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.060
Huffington.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.660
Huffington.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.260
Fartington Publishers.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:45.780
Third edition, 1976.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.260
Yeah.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:49.300
That's the same one that Alvin Chilton had upstairs.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.820
Did you take this from his room?

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.860
Oh, no.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.780
Arvin lent that to me.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.980
He lent it to me to read.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.620
When?

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.660
Can I humint that?

01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.620
Yeah, you can humint that.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.420
Fuck.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.580
It's a 52 on a 50.

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.940
I got a 16 on an 80.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.740
I got a 45 on a 20.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:15.140
With his success, you see that he seems to be telling the truth.

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.180
He did get it from Arvin Chilton.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.740
Arvin gave it to me.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.860
He gave it to me.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.540
He's not feeling weird or wonky around by cops.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.700
He's like, I didn't take it.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.020
Is Arvin's crime spree public knowledge?

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.140
Yes.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.900
And he's identified as a suspect.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.620
Arvin.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:33.860
Yeah.

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:34.580
Yes.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.220
Okay.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.460
So, like, this guy knows that Arvin is...

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:38.820
He didn't do it.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:39.540
I swear.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.420
Like, he wouldn't...

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.260
He wouldn't have done it.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.220
He was a good guy.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.740
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.980
We're trying to figure out who did these horrible things.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.300
Now, when did Arvin lend you that book?

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.340
My mind.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.140
You know, it's a...

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.900
Try and think, please.

01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.300
It fails so much.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.660
The 20th, maybe the 19th.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:10.100
Maybe it was right before he disappeared on the 21st.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:11.620
It was very recent.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.500
Yeah, it was recent.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.100
Did you and Arvin talk often?

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.620
Yeah, he was really nice.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:21.460
He would pick me up groceries if I needed something and I wasn't doing well.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:22.180
I had a fall.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:29.220
Two years ago and he took such good care of me.

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.940
What's the last thing you guys talked about?

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.460
He was getting ready to go to Starbucks.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.420
That's where he worked.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.020
That's where he worked.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.540
And I haven't seen him since that morning.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.100
He was getting ready to go in for a shift.

01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.180
Did he see another character that day?

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.180
No, everything seems so normal.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:55.620
And honestly, people talk about him doing all these horrible things.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.420
He wouldn't have done it.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.700
Agent Asparrow, please.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.260
You have to try some of these cold cuts or these olives.

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:00.820
Aren't they good?

01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.900
Did Arvin seem like a troubled man to you?

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.660
He ignores your question completely and is waiting for an answer.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.460
Elwood is licking his fingers off.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.460
Yeah, the olives are great.

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.460
They're like old, which Elwood loves.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.300
They taste old.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.300
That's the way I like them.

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:20.760
Good.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.780
Kevin, ever since he played football, has been very in tune with his body.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:33.620
Does he feel sick or weird or anything from the half board of meat that he's eaten?

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:35.060
Roll Constitution.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:38.900
Crit success.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.140
You are extremely worried about how long this meat has been left out.

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:46.740
You are very worried about how long this meat has been left out.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:55.060
It is not reacting in your tum tum the way that a nice shock bowl would feel in your tummy.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.220
Um, I'm sick.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:00.260
And he gets up and goes and throws up in the kitchen sink.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.740
He's trying to make us sick.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.820
Are you trying to poison us, Mr. Deschenes?

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.260
No, no, God, no.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.220
I'm sorry.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.500
I must have just forgotten when I bought it.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.540
I would never.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.820
You could go away for a long time if you tried to do harm to federal agents.

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.940
Is that what you're trying to do?

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.860
Oh my goodness.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.220
No, no.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.340
Kevin comes back over and sits down and grabs another hand.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.980
Like without thinking, just grabs another handful of meat.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.500
Elwood tries to grab his hand.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.780
It's already in his mouth.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:32.500
He like lifts you up off of your chair to take a bite.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.460
Kevin, he just said it didn't make you feel good.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.940
Oh, well.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.100
And he just kind of sits there chewing on it.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.260
He's holding, uh, Elwood's holding his hand out in front of Kevin.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.060
Spit it out.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:43.940
Spit it out.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.020
Kevin spits out his food into Elwood's hand.

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:48.180
Clarissa is watching that just like wide-eyed.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.180
Elwood takes it and puts it back onto the charcuterie board.

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.500
Now, where were we?

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.220
Yeah, uh, where were we?

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:05.540
Deschenes' face is twisted and contorted into this so grossed out and so happy.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:11.700
It's clear that he's like a little freak in this moment and he's just like super into it.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:15.780
He really gets along with Elwood like immediately.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.700
The vibes are there.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.420
The aura around both of them is similar.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.060
Similar, yeah.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.700
The reason Kevin didn't notice his stink is because he's used to Elwood's stink.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:34.180
Mr. Deschenes, did Arvin mention this particular play as one of his favorites?

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.620
Is there a reason he lent it to you?

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.060
Yeah, he thought it was fitting.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:46.580
Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end.

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:49.780
But the drowning's been just fine.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:58.020
And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind.

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.820
I'll be alright.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.900
I can go there now that I stare.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.900
Death in the face.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.980
I'll be alright.

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.740
I can go there now that I stare.

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.260
Death in the face.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:38.260
Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry?

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:46.740
Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings is a regular guy?

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:53.140
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:01.380
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.940
I'll be alright.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.940
I can go there now that I stare.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.020
Death in the face.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:14.100
I'll be alright.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:17.860
I can go there now that I stare.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.900
Death in the face.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:14:00.900
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:08.740
Whitewashed hymns and the deadliest sins push me to my limit.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:16.900
But when you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:22.900
After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:48.900
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:56.900
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.

01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:58.900
I'll be alright.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.900
I can go there now that I stare.

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.900
Death in the face.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.900
I'll be alright.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:12.900
I can go there now that I stare.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:24.900
You and me have gone bad in a good way, I promise.
