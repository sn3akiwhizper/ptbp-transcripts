He kept nagging me, though, and I finally gave in and listened to episode one a couple of months ago, Since then, I've binged every episode, became a patron, convinced two other friends and my brother not only to start listening to PTBP, but also to start playing Delta Green. I've converted my wife as well, and we are now relistening to old episodes in between new episodes just to get our fix.

219.20 355.92 speaker1  Last time, our valiant heroes forced Terrence Liquor into the home of Randy Angst, where the old man was on the ground in desperate need of medical attention. on this residential street by a truck with a hot tub instead of a truck bed, as well as a Chevy Impala with a doorless refrigerator on its side strapped to the roof. They stole T Liquor's truck and hoofed it back to the hidden Mitsubishi Eclipse to grab Drew Carey without first losing their tail. Clark grabbed Drew's body and tossed him into the stolen truck's waterbed as the refrigerator Impala and hot tub truck pulled up to the scene. There wasn't much of a standoff though, due to hot tub truck immediately losing its three team members to a massive wave of ooze. The refrigerator Impala, owned and operated by Asher and Avery Little, nope the fuck outta there, leaving our waterbed truck crew as this oozy upsurges only a remaining target. John Lee Pettymore the 3rd, perhaps still wet from his time in the bed of his truck, critically failed a drive check, taking us now to the aftermath. It's a brand new track that rocks, like sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous, into a sign for a local tire shop. It's kudzu with no backbone. And now. If a little rat dick left his seed in you, wouldn't you fucking demand every goddamn cent he had for that child? Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
351.32 429.20 speaker2  That was the perfect introduction to episode. No, I don't want to make an enemy of David Spade. That was a really good introduction to episode 82. It works if you just blink out, Only the first time though. Her mother sent Stern pictures and a letter about her daughter. Stern had her in and sent her pictures to Playboy Her mom got to tell her as soon as she got off the school bus. Would you rather have to have sex with a Howard Stern or David Spade?
427.36 432.20 speaker3  I'd probably go with David Spade.
430.56 436.40 speaker2  So the romance wouldn't be there. Either way.
434.04 446.08 speaker3  Now I'm looking up ugly David Spade and ugly Howard Stern to see who has a worst picture on the internet. Probably David Spade.
444.04 456.96 speaker2  You can go to at pretending pod to get a side by side of those on Instagram or on Twitter. We'll be tagging David Spade's family members.
455.56 459.16 speaker3  He's cute when he's younger.
456.96 476.92 speaker2  Yeah, if we're talking like Tommy boy years, then it's David Spade all day. But if we're talking about old, both of them, then I think I have to go for Stern.
474.52 483.80 speaker3  than anything David Spade did.
482.32 499.92 speaker2  After we said we want to fuck him? Sounds to me like we're playing all our cards right. I don't know anything about him, but I think that's kind of his whole show, right?
498.92 506.44 speaker3  Like a raptor.
505.12 511.88 speaker2  Have it go down your back.
510.32 516.16 speaker3  It's getting long, baby.
514.20 611.64 speaker2  Crit failed to avoid the crane and flipped it, freeze frame. The truck is turned sideways, hits a little rock or something. Tires are bald as fuck and begins turning over. In this moment, I have you guys all roll for constitution. John critically succeeds. Keith passes. Clark critically succeeds. As the truck is flying over, everyone is fine. Seemingly, except for Keith lands on top of Jimmy Sanders. Gonna roll for him right now. Rolled to 98. He's not doing great. He's gonna lose four hit points and stays conscious as Keith lands on top of him. to stay conscious because he's low on hit points leading up to this point. And Clark literally crits with a 69. So as the truck rolls, the water's flying out behind him as he just keeps his legs moving and keeps running and the truck just avoids and the truck moves, rolls, rolls, rolls and explodes into a sign for owls, tires and tigers. The issue being Drew's body with Kerry pages inside lays motionless in an extremely shallow puddle of stinky, stinky water. And Gary Bailey from hanging halfway up out of a sewage drain Just the like long thin ones that the Kleinfella comes out of?
610.80 618.08 speaker3  Yes. Okay, can you actually not mention it?
615.44 640.24 speaker2  Cause I was gonna make a dope it joke. Okay, but I'm leaving that in for sure. Cause that's funny. I said culvert, which I think is an open drain. Or maybe a culvert, right?
639.32 646.40 speaker3  Joe's right. Yeah, so we're all right.
641.40 694.52 speaker2  And so it's a storm train on the side of the road and Gary Daley is like half out of it. Hands, elbows on the concrete and he's hollering at you. Oh, Keith, you need to get down here. What are y'all doing? this massive grouping of ooze. You've never seen this much all in one place before. It is coming toward you slowly. The back end of it coming up over the top like waves breaking. And as I'm doing this with my arms, you can see my pit stains. They are deep, wide. Like the Lord's love. And it is just flowing, flowing toward you. And we are in combat order.
693.20 708.28 speaker3  I want to try and run. Am I near Drew's body? If I'm still standing and running, I would keep running toward it if I am.
706.20 737.12 speaker2  You're definitely strong enough to pick up a little Drew Andrews. How are you carrying him as you're in? Remember, as you pick him up, you're picking up a wet Drew Andrews who's unconscious, but you know it's not Drew inside. Sure.
734.20 757.04 speaker3  So his whole body's on my shoulders, behind my neck on my shoulders. So I think, is that a fireman's carry? I think that's a fireman's carry. I'm doing that. You don't need a fire to have a fireman's carry.
755.56 760.12 speaker2  I think legally you do.
757.04 763.28 speaker3  I think that this might be an illegal maneuver performing here.
761.00 775.56 speaker2  Well, it's yeah, and it's not like a big thing. It's just like a, you can't call it champagne thing. Right, right. Unjust laws should not be laws.
773.76 790.06 speaker3  Well, now hold on, hold on, hold on. That protects the valor, like the growers of the champagne region. I don't think so. Shouldn't exist. I'm with the farmers. I stand with the farmers of Champagne, France.
789.06 794.78 speaker2  I don't think we've looked into it at all. They're probably like huge landowners who don't give a fuck.
792.94 796.02 speaker3  Yeah, actually fuck them, you're right.
794.78 802.06 speaker2  Yeah, fuck champagne. Also, it makes my tummy hurt. Keith Vigno, what are you doing?
800.02 814.70 speaker3  Keith is kind of disoriented, but just is running away from the explosion of the truck. Well, you landed directly on Jimmy Sanders. Oh, yeah.
812.42 817.70 speaker2  number four, just get on top of me with the,
815.70 830.14 speaker3  I stand up and I look at him, and since I know he's conscious or whatever, I kind of help him up, and then I start running towards Gary.
827.30 838.68 speaker2  he's only looking past you and behind you at the ooze that is chasing you. So you can't run if you want to help him up.
837.26 844.54 speaker3  Oh, well that's very kind of you. Currently.
842.78 893.98 speaker2  If Keith is helping Jimmy up and aid him and help that be quicker. Oh, absolutely, then it is done, and Tyler is immediately just following Clark Bishop. Tyler is right on the heels of Clark Bishop, and you are all running toward Gary Daley, who has popped his head up out of this storm drain with a beautiful bright yellow shirt underneath a denim jacket,
891.62 901.44 speaker3  Well, he doesn't look like a clown to me.
898.46 923.74 speaker2  We got me and Gary, and we got some others, but we're hiding, and we need to save you. Obviously, Keith, I mean, Keith needs to get down here, especially. Everybody wants Keith. Come on, hurry up.
921.98 925.70 speaker3  I run towards it, and I kind of like.
924.34 928.62 speaker2  Wait, Keith, even if it is Gary,
927.78 942.90 speaker3  We've been gone for a while. It sounds like everybody in town's with this daddy guy. As he's saying that, I'm slide tackling like you would on a soccer field down into the storm train.
939.86 949.66 speaker2  like give you some drag to slow you down so you can slip in easy? Yep. So you can slip in easy.
946.18 957.90 speaker3  And as soon as I'm in, I process what Clark just said, and I look at Gary, I'm like, ugh.
956.14 962.34 speaker2  they're scary fuckers. That cane he's just taking over town,
959.82 988.26 speaker3  we gotta hide down here, otherwise they'll find us. It comes to those who have seen it? I'm helping Drew down there, I'm getting down in there, and when I get down in there, I'm picking Drew back up, getting him just back on my shoulder so that we're mobile.
985.86 1055.38 speaker2  when they crawl, because it's so cute. Their paws just kind of move, and then just jumps down into it. And once you guys are all down there, you got Jimmy Sanders down there as well, and he's just not paying attention to anything. He immediately just starts stepping into the sewage water. Basically, I'm seeing it as this tunnel that you're now in. You gotta walk away on the right, you gotta walk away on the far left, you've got a sewage waterway moving slowly in between the two pathways, and then we've got an arched tunnel roof made out of stone that leads off into the darkness ahead, and you can't see where it leads to. And Gary looks at John Lee Pettymore the third, and he's like, you, you're, hi Gary, but I feel like you're seeing the goo monster out there, and you know what's going on,
1053.82 1061.70 speaker3  And accept that it's happening.
1058.22 1067.14 speaker4  and I especially don't like that you've, you're dripping. You know you're dripping, right?
1065.58 1074.42 speaker2  No siree. Your nose, your eyes, your ears, your mouth. You got the goo coming out of you,
1072.94 1093.38 speaker4  but it doesn't seem to be, it's like small enough to not be at, and he like, he wants to poke at it, but he's not quite poking at it, and he's like, honestly, if I could just not look at you, that would be for the best for me personally, because I am, and he's rubbing his fingers
1091.34 1101.50 speaker2  and he starts looking at his hands, and he's like, yep. All right, you're dripping.
1098.74 1112.86 speaker3  Yeah, does that allow you to see the goo? Yep. Oh, interesting. I was gonna clarify, when he was talking about the dripping, we didn't see it, right?
1110.54 1128.18 speaker2  and he really avoids eye contact with John Lee Pettymore III from here on out, and he's like, okay, so, and he kind of puts his hand up over your face,
1123.18 1136.06 speaker4  John Lee Pettymore III, who inside of you is our John Lee Pettymore, who's been around, and do I have all that right?
1134.30 1143.46 speaker3  I nod at him and confirm.
1141.46 1156.48 speaker4  your parents aren't inside of you?
1155.18 1160.04 speaker3  I have a human of 30. Can I see if I catch anything in his face?
1158.80 1172.10 speaker2  Yeah, go ahead and roll. No, giving him that much information about old Clark Bishop, you don't notice anything.
1170.64 1209.76 speaker3  Okay. And Drew is actually Kerry Pages. Oh, yeah, when you were asking about that. Me and Clark are who we are, and Drew is Kerry inside of Drew's body. Yep, he's got it right. And I don't mean to be rude,
1206.32 1215.44 speaker2  to the body of Drew Andrews, which is still being held by Clark Bishop.
1214.16 1227.32 speaker3  I think it's because it's, well, Drew has the soul, or the mind, or presence, however you want to define it, of Councilwoman Kerry Pages, because of the church. Or the baguette.
1225.20 1241.44 speaker2  You know, it might be the baguette that he's got, because, you know, it's a long, long baguette, but you gotta cut it in thirds in order to make an eight-inch sandwich, which is what you're gonna wanna get.
1240.06 1261.92 speaker3  But he is Jimmy. What's going on with the pastor and everything in town? We've just got back to town, already seen some weird shit that I can't make complete sense of yet.
1259.66 1269.72 speaker2  He's got a denim jacket over the top of it,
1268.04 1299.16 speaker4  ever since yesterday. put up a wall of water and fish around the church, and has taken to calling himself Daddy, and he has held them all convinced that he can go back in time as long as he can get Keith Vick. You guys are looking at me like you already know all this.
1297.96 1302.92 speaker3  Yeah, we've heard all that.
1301.56 1338.48 speaker4  he got a lot of followers, and he's been interpreting people's dreams, and they've just been following him to the end of the earth, basically, and they'll do whatever he wants. to go back in time somehow. but you don't strike me as people who have a lot of points in computer science. Heh heh heh.
1335.02 1342.34 speaker3  but I would say I took a class in high school.
1340.74 1354.86 speaker2  I have email.
1352.66 1361.38 speaker4  that got wiped off the internet. Nobody could've found it if you just would've Googled around. It got wiped.
1360.06 1381.26 speaker2  What'd it say? He's got a screenshot of this blog. So you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.
1377.50 1387.94 speaker3  Holy shit.
1384.20 1404.86 speaker2  you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com. Dorsey is D-O-R-S-E-Y, It was never Harold.
1403.38 1405.70 speaker3  that people are familiar with.
1404.86 1410.82 speaker2  Yeah.
1407.06 1418.22 speaker3  Zach says it was set up in May, 2017. Did you really register a blogger account three years ago for this campaign? Yeah. That's dope.
1417.38 1422.50 speaker2  Wow.
1420.02 1431.02 speaker3  or did you actually set one up for Harold Dorsey?
1429.80 1681.48 speaker2  or doing the dishes or you're wearing AirPods and you're pooping and your phone is in the other room, if you go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com, you'll find a blog that is entitled What's Behind Dorsey? A True Story in a False City. And there is a single blog posted on Monday, December 3rd, and it is entitled Operation San Ferra Blum of rocking the boat. I was fired from the city star for threatening to self-publish my expose on the glass crime family after a blasphemous night of depravity fight club called the Scrap Pit. Lots of people know about the Scrap Pit. The real party, for those in the know, is even more indescribably profane, celebrities lovingly referred to by its patrons The Den of Sin offers more than just bloodsport. It is torture. Malnourished preteens are trapped in a hanging cage, forced to fight to the death as the ceiling lowers to meet the floor slowly but steadily. hold hands in solidarity with each other, accepting their demise. The offended roar of the booing crowd was quickly replaced with lustful cheers as the hanging cage performed its singular trick like a French press or a citrus juicer. to the metallic smelling dark red waterfall. Well, I've somehow survived that mess. A target on my back, sure, but that's just business. Most of us don't think about the small town of contention about an hour west of here, and the animal-filled creeks, but what you may not know is the chief of police recently contacted me, quote, Operation Sanfera Blum, or the flowers that make their home all over our downtown here in the city. She asked if I knew anything about BarCorp, its subsidiaries, or the Shell Corporation, which owns the company, which owns the company, which owns the company, which owns BarCorp. She asked if I knew anything about the mill on the other side of the city, and she asked if I knew her father, Jim Cook. So I began digging, and I began following Jim Cook around the city. That man can spot a tail, but he couldn't spot whoever it was that caught him in an alley two nights ago. I'm worried I am next. I'm even more worried that Maggie Cook is now too spooked to speak on the record. Chief Maggie Cook was passionate, irate, and eager, and then nothing. We were supposed to meet in person last night, December 2nd, no word. I received a message this morning changing the time and location of our meeting. If I don't update the blog by tonight, please begin the search by questioning Contention Chief of Police, Maggie Cook. So you guys' eyes look back up, and Gary Daley's just like,
1679.48 1694.20 speaker4  I read this, and I was like, what?
1692.40 1699.12 speaker2  but here in Contention,
1696.16 1706.56 speaker4  that it was talking about in here, I don't know.
1701.68 1854.28 speaker3  yeah, that's all basically true. What Maggie's involved in, it goes way farther than Contention itself. Guys, what is, like with the flowers and all that in his blog post, Keith, you pretended to know what it was, and we didn't know what it was. Clark, you've kind of been in touch with Maggie, haven't you? Has she said anything about her dad, or? She asked why I was searching through her daddy's book. I remember that. She hasn't said much about Jim himself, but just the stuff that we found putting dots together in the carkled hole. It's just odd that he was following Jim around and that Maggie said to open up the eyes of the city. It just... two nights before? December 1st, and every birthday, if there's footage in the alley back there, we might be able to see who got him. That's true. It's a great lead. Can we do anything with this information right now? that he knew he had a tail. It was a round face man with glasses or something like that, Maggie was turning on Jim. Maggie was spilling secrets to Harold about Jim. That's what we've gathered from this. Yeah. They must have changed it to her house. She changed it to her house from somewhere else, correct? That's where you found Harold, right? I don't know what to do with that information, but that's what I'm gathering here now. Do you think you could get us to the pond through these tunnels?
1851.80 1881.64 speaker4  I can get you anywhere you want, basically. And they basically, when the mine shored up, they took all the old tunnels that they were using to get around, and they bricked them all up and made a very, very modern sewage system. And so we can get pretty much anywhere we want around here through them tunnels about there.
1880.52 1895.16 speaker3  Like Ninja Turtles. You're whichever turtle you need to be.
1892.52 1966.92 speaker2  before you make it to an underground chamber where Gary Daley and Harry Klinker have set up a makeshift campsite. This room is square and roughly 30 yards across, with four concrete columns placed evenly about 10 yards from each other. The ground is mostly dry, though there are puddles scattered about where the concrete floor has eroded away a bit. and a luminous camping lantern lighting your view from the very, very center of the room. There is slight commotion by the far tent as you enter this space. Mildred Mitchell, upon seeing your group, is fleeing into the portable canvas shelter and zipping up the flap. As a woman you do not recognize questions her from outside the outdoor domicile. who lived across from John Peters, who I believe called in to say that John Peters' door was swinging open and his mail was piling up in the first episode.
1964.84 1978.28 speaker3  what is the significance of all that,
1976.44 2042.52 speaker2  is on the outside kind of questioning her, but closer to you you see a man sitting up against one of the concrete columns reading a book. He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet. His beer gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt and over his cutoff shorts, which has been his outfit of choice for the past 30 years. Thanks to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City for Casey Kristoff. if you support us on Patreon at the $10 level of the contention citizens or higher. And then you see Harry Klinker sitting outside the nearest tent. And as soon as you guys walk in there he stands up. He's clearly relieved. He's all over his face when he sees Gary in there with you guys. And you all enter into this underground temporary home.
2039.08 2055.24 speaker3  I didn't want to stop your flow, but you're a super robot. Just one?
2054.52 2096.04 speaker2  You're back! Keep talking. Because when I talk I don't lightly swerve. I swerve hard to the right. Then I keep that shit up. And I go in circles till I throw up. Nice. Okay, so two tents. One across the room from you where Mildred Mitchell hopped into. And there was a woman standing outside. And the other tent where Harry Klinker is sitting outside of. He stood up to greet you as you walked in. Hey boys, oh my god. It's been a crazy couple days, no see.
2094.84 2100.36 speaker3  Casey Kristoff. Casey Kristoff, okay, sorry.
2099.24 2127.88 speaker4  I found them. They were just, they were out there. They'd wrecked and I mean it was coming for them. Goo was coming for them, you know. And thankfully they're here and we're fine. I showed them the Dorsey block spot. And yeah, we're just, oh boy.
2122.28 2134.76 speaker0  Really, really is not being very good to the people, you know.
2133.80 2148.76 speaker3  God, I don't know. Maybe, maybe a hundred. And what about you guys down here? Is this all of us?
2147.40 2156.52 speaker2  one of which is hiding in a tent.
2151.88 2176.76 speaker4  I mean for now, we did have, we have a code outside of clinkers, you know. If people can read it, it says tunnels and they can get down here. What sort of code?
2174.12 2184.12 speaker3  So I, I recognize most of you down here.
2183.08 2232.68 speaker4  She's from the city. She was hanging out with when all this started and she kind of got stuck here. Unfortunately, they, they got lost to, you know, Kane's movement.
2227.56 2242.84 speaker2  And the tattoo is of a robed figure holding a ball of light. Clara Blankenship was created by Annie Beat, another citizen of contention over on the Patreon.
2241.56 2293.96 speaker3  Annie, you are okay. When I see her tattoo, I kind of look at the other two officers and like kind of wide-eyed. Did you guys just call me over here for- Uh, yeah. Hold on, I'm googling that. What's, what's your deal, Clara? That's a real interesting tattoo you got there. Is that from any kind of Zeppelin album?
2293.48 2331.80 speaker4  dreams. See, back then, this dream, it was just this, this robed figure with this ball of light But recently, I've been having this dream where he's pulling the ball of light out of a television? It's, it's so weird because before, it was as if there was, you know, it was like all dirt and stuff, so I didn't really expect technology to be a part of these dreams, but you know, some people are having dreams that are in the modern world, some in the future even, and you know, it's, it's just, have you, what are the dreams you, I assume you guys have been having dreams. How long have you been in contingent?
2331.32 2335.08 speaker3  The book? Which book? I study a lot of occult books.
2333.56 2336.68 speaker2  Is there a specific book you're talking about?
2335.08 2353.40 speaker3  Looking at the two officers. The, the, the thing we saw though, had the light emitting from a mouth. It wasn't being held like an orb. It's odd, but you've been having dreams about this. I mean, everybody has weird dreams.
2352.52 2376.68 speaker4  Who were you visiting? They were, unfortunately, they were persuaded. They, see, they, they lost their cat to all this mess and unfortunately when, when they were promised an option to, I don't know if you've heard, the pastor is saying he
2372.84 2381.32 speaker2  So, you know, they, they really want their cat back.
2377.72 2392.04 speaker3  Their cat's probably just in the river there with all the other cats and dogs. Not in the podcast, no.
2390.76 2405.96 speaker2  Did you tell them to check the river?
2399.80 2411.96 speaker4  Uh, both the creek, the pond, everything was emptied by the collectors.
2411.72 2443.88 speaker2  now. I haven't seen him since. Are you kidding me? Have you seen that shit? I've got to let Murphy in real quick.
2439.72 2455.08 speaker3  Uh, I think there might be something at the bottom of it, but Claire, you said that all the water got drained out of it. Is that right? Yeah.
2454.20 2459.88 speaker2  campus of the church.
2459.72 2471.08 speaker3  to get to the bottom of.
2466.12 2482.20 speaker4  worked there for about 18 years, and I don't know if you've studied much history, but I certainly, sorry, this kind of sounds like I'm being a dick.
2481.64 2494.04 speaker3  Oh. Bellagio. It's a Bellagio sort of situation, I'd imagine. Magnets.
2492.12 2505.64 speaker4  I guess I need to go to Las Vegas then.
2504.12 2525.96 speaker2  He's been the janitor for years. Can I help?
2525.24 2535.16 speaker3  Yeah, they'll do it.
2528.92 2562.84 speaker2  He's listening in, and he was very intrigued when this group of people walked in. Also, Clark, what did you do with the body of Drew Carey? and he's just like sniffing at Drew Carey this whole time, and Jimmy Sanders is just like wandering kind of in circles around the room mumbling to himself.
2561.24 2579.08 speaker3  but try and see if I can revive.
2577.40 2584.44 speaker0  That's exactly what I could use, thank you.
2582.60 2586.60 speaker3  Yeah, just a passed roll.
2585.00 2595.56 speaker2  You know, opens up all sorts of doors.
2594.52 2596.76 speaker4  Carey, you with us?
2596.04 2626.76 speaker3  Yeah, hey. We dragged you down here with us, and we turned Tyler into a hell dog, and it's gonna nibble at your feet for all of eternity.
2619.08 2647.40 speaker2  Tyler's just like licking Drew Carey's, you know, face and feet back and forth. There's more where that came from.
2646.28 2692.20 speaker3  Boys, can you help me out here? Tyler, shut up. Tyler! If you're listening, write in an NPC with like special powers and they can help us.
2684.12 2702.52 speaker2  And I believe in the description, it did say that she owns all of Silas Cole's journals. She literally did exactly that.
2701.32 2705.08 speaker0  That's great.
2703.32 2707.24 speaker3  Was the tattoo written in on there too?
2706.76 2715.64 speaker2  I love it.
2714.84 2720.60 speaker0  Who's a good boy?
2718.92 2724.28 speaker3  Are you feeling all right?
2723.48 2733.08 speaker2  Everything is fine. Thank you. Now that the love of my life is here with me and everything is fine.
2729.56 2769.00 speaker3  Your original mission was to bring us back to the church, is that right? Yes. And was that with the explicit purpose of getting Keith back to the church or was it all three of us at that point?
2767.80 2777.64 speaker2  That's not what happened.
2777.16 2786.92 speaker3  were gone. Now, if that didn't get communicated to the town, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but we sent it into the station.
2785.96 2792.28 speaker2  Have you heard Kudzu?
2790.68 2818.38 speaker3  That new song is a real banger. with our good friend, Ru.
2817.88 2828.20 speaker2  now.
2826.68 2842.04 speaker3  we figured her out.
2839.64 2860.76 speaker4  It's like dogs only like one person.
2855.00 2872.92 speaker2  sides of a dog and they're both calling to it, it goes to the, I guess, the evil person in this situation, technically, from your perspective. But Tyler runs to the body of Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages grabs it around the neck once more.
2872.36 2894.92 speaker4  I love you. I love you. And it's like, thank you. Thank you, John. I know you didn't want to do that, but it's just, this is my everything. You know how we thought that most things were fucked? It seems that everything is fucked.
2894.12 2925.00 speaker3  world, weren't you? Is this ringing any bells in any of your research or anything? How about goo? Was goo on your radar before today? Does this remind you of a certain Lindsay Lohan movie? Or perhaps have you researched the works of Silas Cole?
2917.88 2966.92 speaker4  And you know, I'm into a lot of this here stuff, but you know, I've seen some actual magic in my life. I mean, you'll remember the conversation we had on the phone when you were on the way to the city. It had, you know, three pages left in it. And they were specifically for the three of you. And boy, those words danced off light like the page and just lit like a fire.
2966.04 2969.80 speaker3  That makes sense.
2968.92 2984.20 speaker2  Who's Justin? Never mind.
2982.52 3000.92 speaker4  It was very thick, very thick. But when you'd open it up, you could only get to like three pages. And then once they were gone, it was just empty. It was just shell on both sides, but it was still full. It looked like a book, but there's nothing in there.
2999.16 3013.08 speaker3  Kind of looks like her tattoo. The book itself, it was maybe skin bound. Was the book you had bound by perhaps skin?
3009.24 3021.96 speaker2  The face of Gary Daley loses blood.
3021.32 3036.92 speaker3  Yeah. Yeah, when the pages were gone, what did you do with it?
3033.72 3041.08 speaker2  Clark, we found it in Jim's house.
3038.60 3055.56 speaker3  That you gave it to if you give it to anybody.
3054.44 3066.44 speaker2  Sorry, what was that?
3062.76 3097.00 speaker3  the entity before us that pretends to be Drew cannot be trusted. And Karen and Jim seemed to want it desperately. But Kevin found it and he didn't reveal it to the others. That's all I saw. Do you know where it is now?
3091.48 3112.12 speaker4  I knew how much power it had, but I didn't know that people were going to be after it the way they were. And I think they died because I gave it to them.
3109.56 3121.08 speaker3  Like this is really hitting some notes.
3118.04 3130.28 speaker4  I just, I knew I needed to get rid of it because I didn't.
3128.20 3155.00 speaker3  they did, they said something about Karen. Karen, they said Karen did a magic trick and they all had to get out of there. And that's, that was the last time I, I don't, I don't understand though. Why would you think that they would want a book like that?
3151.48 3177.48 speaker4  And they always asked about the signs up on the wall. And we would talk often about, you know, conspiracy theories and occult texts. And they seem knowledgeable about that. No, they were just, they just had a passing interest, I think. I didn't want it.
3175.40 3204.44 speaker3  Did, did they, did they take the book? Like, did they know what they had? Did they, did they seem, did they seem gleeful in having it or was it just a curiosity for them? I don't remember seeing it in the house personally. So they obviously secreted it away or something.
3200.20 3209.24 speaker4  So they knew, they knew the power that it had if they actually trusted me.
3207.88 3230.86 speaker3  They couldn't do anything anymore, right? 75 on a 50. Fuck.
3229.58 3235.76 speaker2  Coming across as genuine.
3235.26 3241.90 speaker4  Oh.
3240.70 3243.76 speaker3  Also, you said you failed.
3243.26 3259.58 speaker2  I know.
3258.70 3270.62 speaker3  Do you know where he got it? What was your grandfather's name, by the way?
3269.26 3282.70 speaker2  That's not in the podcast. Fuck. I don't know if I ever said it. Yeah.
3281.74 3296.38 speaker4  Grant Father. His name was Grant Father Bailey.
3293.98 3307.82 speaker3  Where, you know where old Grant got that book?
3305.90 3322.94 speaker2  You see that figure right there? Can you imagine that?
3319.02 3408.72 speaker3  You don't know if it's a bad day, a bad, uh, bad childhood. Blind. Have you ever seen anything like that? the hospital after I went to follow up on some, some lead, it seems like years ago now. I remember that he gave you that note that was in binary, right? Yeah. He sure was. Uh, and then he, then he said, say hi to me for me. Do you reckon that might've been old Clark? We've certainly seen old me in robes. That's that's when, when he did that thing in the mausoleum, he was wearing a robe. John like jots down suspect has been seen in robes. But that would, that would mean that I, when I was, when I was a kid, Gary, Gary, you were there. What? And when you read from the book, do you remember this? Okay.
3407.12 3425.20 speaker4  I stand by that though. The book of, you know, St. Oscythe witches or whatever I was reading that day does not have anything to do with any cloaked figures except for witches. You know, obviously sometimes we're cloaks, but either way, Gary, whether you did it or
3421.84 3438.56 speaker3  not, which I think you did, but whether you did it or not, you were there. And we saw that you remember that there was a cloak. There was a cloak man. He, he locked up the doors to the library and he was, he was being chased or chasing someone.
3438.16 3444.96 speaker2  tattoo. And then he's like, Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
3443.68 3479.36 speaker4  That would be extremely rude. Can I just look at that much closer? And she's like, yeah, of course, that's fine. that day. I swear to God. And thankfully that figure locked us in, right? Yeah. He used some sort of chains or something because there were these big tall creatures. Oh my goodness. They were these lanky translucent skin fuckers.
3476.32 3494.40 speaker3  I remember now it was the, it was the thing that's been yelling at us. They were chasing the robed figure. And now you're saying that that could be old me. I don't know. I turned to Clara.
3489.52 3507.68 speaker4  I know you guys are having like a whole thing right now and it seems, seems really important.
3500.80 3516.72 speaker2  in my recurring dreams for the past few years and a long time now, I have this video that
3510.80 3554.80 speaker4  And since it's been scrubbed from the internet and I'm pretty sure that like some sort of black ops special secret service kind of like men in black shit took it off the internet because I looked him up recently. I think he disappeared. It's this YouTube video. He used to have a channel where he talked about the dreams he had during this coma that he was in for like a while.
3549.84 3616.40 speaker2  pod, Twitter at pretending pod, or go to the Facebook page, which is pretending to be people. And you can find this video. I'll play the audio of it right now. If I can make that happen. existing. I was led there by a man who only carried a black Nike bag and when he reached out to shake my hand upon introductions, it smelled of sweet meats like a grill and my hand burned and burned. That is all for now. Like and subscribe and I will update more soon. to
