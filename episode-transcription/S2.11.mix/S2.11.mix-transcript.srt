1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, children, children, gather round ye old grease pit, for it is time for Uncle Wolfie to tell you all his special secrets.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But first, remember, Uncle Wolfie is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP whenever and wherever I am's best radio station.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Possibly the only one, depending on when and where I reside, dimensionally speaking, of course.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But no matter the dimension, I always love hearing from y'all on our special segment, Howlin' with Wolf.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At TD Underscore Beck, who tweeted about the show and tagged At Pretending Pod.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can do that too if you want, right now, while I read this message even. Go on and do it.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But also, listen.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, what the fuck kind of wild-ass shit is this that you are writin' to me, Touchdown Beck? Some kind of Cold War-ass activation code bullshit?

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am the only one who will be activating anybody today, Touchdown Beck. And they shall know when it is time to rise to the howl of their wolf.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They answer my call gladly. And then, we feed.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you want to write up something way better than what TD Underscore Beck just did for Uncle Wolfie to howl, go ahead and tag At Pretending Pod on them social media accounts.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Except Facebook, where it's pretending to be people.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Go on, now. I dare you to do better than your fellow PTBP fans with an excellent Howlin' with Wolf.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And while y'all are thinkin' up some good stuff, go on and give us that good stuff by writin' up a five-star review on those podcast apps.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It'll make Uncle Wolfie a happy big boy.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Some people say I got nothin' to lose. I say I got the news.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Last time, the captains of the crew, Sans Dr. Shark, followed Mitch Diggory, now in ceremonial crop-top hooded robe, to a clearing deeper in the island.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This clearing had more ditches filled with blood, and finally, an innermost circle moat filled with water.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
At five points around this circular moat, shallow pools the size of coffins held a sort of collateral for each pirate crew.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Each ship left a mate here in one of these pools in exchange for an orator, who will be chanting on the back of each ship,

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:31,000
while releasing liquid from a special barrel's bunghole as the crews fight to be the first to complete a circle around this island that sits just northeast of Las Antigas Mayores.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And this weird, old money-havin' Diggory family was wearin' black crop-top hoodies.

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Some folks can call them crudies. Some call them hop-tops. Personally, I'm a big fan of croupy-toodies.

24
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Takin' us now to Wavy Adler, Mr. Spitz, Alabaster Al, and their orator Mitch Diggory, son of the croupy-tooty laden Diggory family,

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
as they head back to the death of a salesman to race around the island for a job opportunity.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's R slash recruiting hell, and it's R.I. Peter with cruisin'.

27
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ðŸŽµ

28
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah.

29
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The guy said he read through Luke's Twitter feed and was like,

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you'll be right at home. We've got a couple dirtbags working here.

31
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then I sent him a picture of my face on the Wheatus's guy's face and said,

32
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm just a late 20s dirtbag baby. And then I tweeted it later.

33
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, it was a good tweet.

34
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Also, yeah, he's also an ordained minister.

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I said, I can't believe I haven't seen you there when he sent me his Universal Life Church badge.

36
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's talk about what you guys have to do to win this competition, huh?

37
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You gotta make sure that bunghole keeps on flowin'.

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

39
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And the orator's words keep on spillin'.

40
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right.

41
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Anything else?

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Noi interruptions.

43
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Noice.

44
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Noiled it.

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And in order to-

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Noiled it.

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Noiled it.

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In order to truly noil the whole thing, you have to be the first to complete your circle.

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We noil.

50
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A complete circle.

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, it doesn't have to be a perfect circle. It just has to be a complete circle.

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A perfect circle would be probably too hard of a task for a sailboat.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Boys, I think we're gonna be fighting a lot of fuckin' pirates this-

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What time of day is it?

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Day.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This day.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's very irony.

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

59
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We're gonna be fighting a lot of other pirates this day, and I am just glad to know that

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
we've got Dr. Shark here with us as I point to Jimmy.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And as I say that, I hand him one of- I've taken one of Dr. Shark's legs before they

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
put him in the pod.

63
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
One of his legs?

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's got two peg legs.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, right.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wow, the picture in your mind was so funny for a second.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You've been playing too much The Forest.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So we see Alabaster Al carrying this wooden peg leg from Dr. Shark as he's got his arm

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
tightly around Jimmy.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I hand it over to the new Dr. Shark, because I didn't spy a weapon on him.

71
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Nice.

72
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And so now he's legged.

73
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He's legged?

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well legged.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And what's Wavy Adler look like as he fucking jaunts like into battle?

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Like you're heading out to sea right now.

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now we're on the tendy, heading back to the main ship.

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's excited because like one of the few- I mean he does a lot on the ship.

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's kind of the elder statesman of the ship that people kind of look to him for kind of

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
general things there.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But one of the things that he prides himself on is his navigation skills.

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so running a circle around this island is right up his alley.

83
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He's got a spring in his step.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's like pulling out his spyglass and making sure that it's all in order as he's walking along.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's wiping the lens off on his tattered gross jacket, maybe even licking it,

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
making sure that it's all spit-shined up there at the front there.

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Awesome.

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And Mr. Spitz?

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mr. Spitz is trying to talk to Mitch like out of earshot of his mom,

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
which might not be too difficult over like the waves and shit,

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and the splash of the oars and stuff as we're rowing up to the boat.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And he's like-

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, I think you're a good-looking man.

94
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, I mean, but I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul.

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's just, Mitch, you're so very special, Mitch.

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I appreciate you saying that.

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm just a creep. I'm a weirdo, Mitch.

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You guys are my weirdos. We're gonna win.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Mitch, that's not what I was talking about, but I appreciate the compliment.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, no problem. What's up, man?

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Listen, what exactly is the prize? We get a job, right?

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What the hell are we doing here?

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, what the hell are we doing here, Mitch?

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, yeah, no, it's a job that was gonna earn enough treasure to embarrass the queen.

106
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Enough treasure to embarrass the queen.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Is that some kind of ironic like catch thing where like she will be embarrassed,

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but we don't actually get any treasure?

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No, I think that we'll all be splitting like an absolute fuck ton of treasure.

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Which queen we're talking about here?

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Uh, Elizabeth. No, that's not what I was-

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No, she's been dead for-

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
God rest her soul!

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The mom says.

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Because it's June, that's right. Yes, June.

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right, so Mitch.

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, yeah, man.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What are we doing?

119
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What sort of services are we providing to you, though? Like your family?

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What does the bong hole test prove? And what's with your words?

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Roll psychology.

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Can I roll to help him?

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, you can all roll psychology.

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh.

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh.

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Tight, I fail. I only have a 10, but-

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh my god. I only have 10 also, but I rolled a 69.

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh!

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Excellent.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You just butt in.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know if he'd- Could Spitz use a praise?

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He only looks at the world through like items of value.

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and roll a praise.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh, five.

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
These people have enough wealth to where you think if they're looking to compound their wealth,

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
they seem to have enough, but then again, the human condition wants more, so.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They're just like those Hammonds.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The process of that appraisal is Spitz very creepily sniffing at him.

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And then like-

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're getting smells you've never smelled before.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And he rubs the fabric of the-

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, you're getting feels you never felt before.

144
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And with a 69, Joe Wavy Adler has this feeling right down in his little pilot bullet.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Little pilot Barry.

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Little pilot Barry.

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Makes your little pirate bird twitch.

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Pilot Barry actually won the first- that was the first pirate to win an Oscar.

149
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Pilot Barry?

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
My pilot Barry's feeling weird.

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You fully believe that Mitch and maybe even the mom believe that there is a treasure to

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
be had after this competition.

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
However, you get the sense that both of them have a steady, heavy amount of mistrust for

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the father figure of the family, which is also the father of the family.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And his name was?

156
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Diggory.

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wavy was the one that clocked that it was the Diggorys, right?

158
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yep.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey, aren't you guys- what was the name?

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Diggory, right?

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I remember you guys.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You guys used to be from the old days.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You guys have been gone for a while.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's not us.

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What?

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's Mitch Diggory and Doug Diggory.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Doug, it's you.

168
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You talking to the mom?

169
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Doug is the dad.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Or at least what I said his name is.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, his name is definitely Doug.

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're 100% right.

173
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We've been finding treasure.

174
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Of course.

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We had to make it look like we had disappeared.

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're finding treasure.

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It takes time and you have to take yourself away from society.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Is that what Doug tells you?

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yes.

180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Doug.

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Ah, that was pretty good.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He appraises that joke.

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Noise.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, that's good to see her alive and well, I guess.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You found much treasure, yeah?

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We know where it is.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We just don't have a crew that can attain it.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And that's what we're here for.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now it's all coming together.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They want to buy the best crew.

191
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And that's us.

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's us.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And I'm looking at-

194
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, it's our pirate cat.

195
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Meow.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm looking at the quality of the fabric and the smell of the perfumes in our boy Mitch's hair.

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If it's a treasure that would tempt even these richy riches.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Should we cut his hair off?

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I mean, maybe he's like a nice souvenir keepsake, but only if he says so.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You just talked about how nice his hair smelled and I thought maybe I'd like to keep some.

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Mr. Spence gets very jealous.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Mrs. Knife flies in and just-

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Cut it off.

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Al takes his Octo knife out, which is-

205
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wait, no, no, no. He doesn't.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, the parrot just told me to.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He says, what a looker.

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

209
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What a looker. Cut it off.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Should we get that clean?

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
As soon as you say you want a lock of Mitch's hair, Spitz is giving you death eyes.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He's got his Octo knife out and he's just very precisely cutting, like shaving his head.

213
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mrs. Knife said it.

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And like taking all of his hair.

215
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What?

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah, Mrs. Knife.

217
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We're on a boat with Keith.

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
More like worm fingers.

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, it's definitely Mrs. Knife's fault, honestly.

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He wasn't going to do it if he wasn't instructed to, but he heard somebody say-

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Cut it off.

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And so he did.

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So he's shaving his head and as he's doing it, puts a little in his pocket, gives a little

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
bit to Mr. Spitz and hands a little bit over to Waverly as well.

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Mr. Spitz takes it, but he is like seething in rage and he says, you destroyed something beautiful.

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Waverly says-

227
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, no thanks. I'm full.

228
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Mitch reaches out.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Can I actually have gaps of some of that?

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, of course. It's yours after all.

231
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Mr. Spitz has wet some with his spit and is trying to pat it down on Mitch's hair.

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You know the monks that just shave everything except the very top of their head?

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You mean the opposite?

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No, there's ones that do what you're thinking and then there's ones that do a mirror version of it.

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah?

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's cool.

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And then they do like ponytails sometimes.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's top knot monks.

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But I'm imagining that just like with spit.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Top knot monks.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He's a top knot monk now.

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And he says, do you guys have any mirrors on the death of a salesman?

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Look around you.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The whole thing's a mirror.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So no.

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Then I don't know what the fuck that means.

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Al looks down into the ocean and sees his reflection in the ocean and points to it.

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He sees himself with no hair.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He freaks the fuck out.

253
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He's like, Oh God.

254
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh, okay.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
All right.

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I guess I'll take a negative 20 for the rest of the day.

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh fuck.

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's right boy.

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You're not beautiful no more.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I guess I belong here now.

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's no mirrors aboard.

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Don't worry.

263
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh good.

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We don't much like contemplating our parents.

265
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Before we get on the death of a salesman, I think we're about to fight for our lives.

266
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So I think some more paint is going to be apt at this point.

267
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,500
And he kind of wets his hands in the ocean, sticks his hands into his pockets, which have

268
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
gunpowder in them.

269
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,000
And he with like wet gunpowder on his hands, like puts it onto the now bald Mitch for some

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,500
like crazy looking war paint that successfully like adheres two or three blonde Charlie Brown

271
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:32,500
strands sticking up and some tears like flow down through the war paint gunpowder war paint.

272
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
It's actually fucking rad.

273
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,500
So for Mitch, he has gunpowder war paint with just like hands on like the side of his head,

274
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
on his face and head.

275
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,500
For me, I do the same and just kind of do underneath the eyes, like football style.

276
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,000
Do you break one of your like massive boils on your face when you know the gunpowder rubs

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
into it and, but this is something Dr Shark has told them to do multiple times is rub

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
the gunpowder into his open wounds.

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Um, I don't know if it helps or not, but Dr Shark definitely told you to and then, and

280
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
then he, he puts his hands back down.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He didn't, it was like a 20 style insult, rub gunpowder and you open wounds.

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It was like, okay, thanks doc walks around totally gone.

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Uh, and so then I like reapply the wet gunpowder and look at you guys.

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm like seeing if kind of gauge in if you want any or not.

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh no, thanks.

286
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm full.

287
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Um, Spitz is no longer angry and he's just like pouting and sad and he's like, I wanted

288
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
to do Mitch's war paint.

289
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Uh, I hear, I hear you do that and I wash my, my hands off in the ocean.

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Get them wet and I open up my pocket full of gunpowder so that you can get your hands

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
wet and do more war paint to yourself and to, to Mitch.

292
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's not the same.

293
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And he said, all right, you guys go up on the ship and I'm going to take this Tindy

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
off to the other one.

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The, uh, big dreadnought pirate.

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Uh, what was his name?

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Neckbeard.

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So yeah, Mr Spitz kind of like looks at wavy and owl, uh, and they nodded each other and

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
they're like, well CS, it seems like you think you might be in charge of that, but over there,

300
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
but we're more of a pirate democracy and we've elected some captains of our own for

301
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
your ship.

302
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Meet Mrs. Knife and a parrot swoops in.

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah.

304
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And bows and a self congratulatory says, what a looker.

305
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And then, uh, a Emperor Tamarin monkey with full mustache comes flinging across like the

306
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
side of the ship and lands directly in the Tindy.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And then the pirate lands on the monkey's shoulder.

309
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The pirate?

310
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's what I said.

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The pirate.

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That was a horrible accent.

313
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Mrs North is as much pirate as any of us.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Exactly.

315
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She's a pirate parrot.

316
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Jesus Christ, the Emperor Tamarin monkey full mustache comes swooping in into the Tindy

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and then the parrot lands on his shoulder.

318
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Moving on.

319
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And with that, the mother diggery begins rowing off to the ship that is nearby in the distance.

320
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Waverly kind of mutters to himself, 50 years on a ship and a parrot and a goddamn monkey

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
make captain for ideas.

322
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's just not supposed to party, Joe.

323
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We're on the boat right now, right?

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Would you like to play the monkey?

325
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was going to say, well, if Jesus, if, if Jesus Christ is off to, uh, off to, uh, yeah,

326
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the new images of Jesus Christ and Mrs. Knife, they're, they're gonna run the other boat,

327
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
right?

328
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah.

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are we on the boat currently right now?

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm going to go up here real quick and then we'll basically start with you guys like on

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
the boat.

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay.

334
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Description going.

335
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, I, because I so heavily invested into the animal handling thing, I'm going to call

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
my other monkey up to, I mean, I think you could also just play the monkey that's on

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the ship and if you haven't, so like what if it knows semaphore and you can signal to

338
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
it and shit.

339
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's pretty good.

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yes.

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You don't string the flags up.

342
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's literally doing fucking hand semaphore.

343
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yeah.

344
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The other monkey can help me do that.

345
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They do it to each other.

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,500
I tried to teach them the actual way to do it and they couldn't learn it, but they have

347
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,000
their own kind of, yeah.

348
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm like, he's telling them the right thing.

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah.

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's going to be so great when they betray us, but also, okay, I'm trying to think, I've

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
been running through my head.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Like what?

353
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Jesus Christ is monkey number one.

354
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
What's the name of the other monkey?

355
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Mary Magdalene.

356
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,040
See, I was thinking biblical, but I thought it would be funnier.

357
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,160
Maybe just to go, Larry, this is me monkeys.

358
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Jesus Christ and shit monkey.

359
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
What's opposite of Jesus Christ?

360
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Little devil.

361
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Santa.

362
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Dude, Jesus Christ and Santa Claus.

363
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Are not opposites.

364
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Well, but they're funny names for monkeys.

365
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,160
As Mrs. Diggory is rolling away, Edward spits, like leans over the railing and shouts, and

366
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:38,160
remember Mrs. Diggory, we've got your boy.

367
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,160
And you can see in the distance on this boat, even in the beautiful, beautiful sunlight

368
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:53,160
and daytime that it is out currently, clear blue water below this whole 10D sky above,

369
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Mrs. Diggory shivers.

370
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,160
I really fucking want some chicken dinners.

371
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Do you guys hit the deck of the death of a salesman?

372
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:12,160
I want you to tell me a little bit more about your ship and how it fares in battle.

373
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,160
It's got wings and it flies in the air.

374
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Hey, I'd be not shit, but beast.

375
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:29,160
As soon as Al gets on deck, he wants to go back down kind of into his like little domain.

376
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,160
So he walks into the door on the ship and goes down into kind of the underbelly of the ship.

377
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:43,160
He's probably got like the front quarter of the ship underneath is his like little living area slash like laboratory.

378
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,160
And there's like gunpowder and different like, you know, kind of chemically looking stuff in there.

379
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Doohickeys and gadgets.

380
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Doohickeys, gadgets, all sorts of stuff.

381
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Mostly it all looks like it's about to like a lighter goes off and the whole thing explodes.

382
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I love that.

383
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,160
But he walks in and he's got, you know, his like meticulously made bed and everything.

384
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,160
And then he goes over into the corner and there's a cage.

385
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,160
One cage is empty and one cage has Emperor Tamarin monkey in it.

386
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
A clone?

387
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
No.

388
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Well, you can see the cages are kind of like on top of each other and the top one says Jesus Christ.

389
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Yeah.

390
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
And the other one says crowbar.

391
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Okay. Awesome.

392
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
It's because he likes to primate.

393
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
And so he gets crowbar out.

394
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
He gets crowbar out.

395
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:51,160
He refills his pockets with gunpowder and he just kind of sits on the bed, takes a few deep breaths, kind of like gathers himself and then heads back up to the top.

396
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,160
Even though it's a pun name, I'm still imagining crowbar as way harder.

397
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Like little monkey tattoos.

398
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Got a monkey weight set in his little monkey cage.

399
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Jesus Christ is live.

400
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Crowbar is jacked.

401
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,160
Crowbar is, he's like four times as heavy.

402
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,160
So like when he's on my shoulder, it's like weighs me down.

403
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
He's like 50 pounds.

404
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
He's bit everyone on board.

405
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
It's like a ferocious toddler.

406
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
As you, as you bring him back up on, as you bring, yeah, they can rip your face off.

407
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,160
As you bring him back up the deck, like every single person on your crew is freaking out.

408
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,160
They're like, they never know if it's going to be a Jesus Christ day or a crowbar day.

409
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Whispers, whispers, thread, like up the decks.

410
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
It's crowbar. Crowbar's coming.

411
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,160
There's a reason that there's a lock on crowbars cage and not on Jesus's cage.

412
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
The stone had been rolled away.

413
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Until Jesus went off to captain another ship.

414
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
This is why we trusted Jesus to do it.

415
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Jesus was a great monkey.

416
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Jesus was a great monkey. He is a great monkey.

417
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Crowbar's a great pirate.

418
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,160
I come back up onto the deck and I see Waverly.

419
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Waverly's getting prepared for what we're doing.

420
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
So he's up there making sure that all the crew men are getting to their stations.

421
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
He's probably calling out. I don't know ship call outs.

422
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Oh, just do one.

423
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,160
To sails. All hands to sails.

424
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Awesome.

425
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,160
He's starting to scout where the starting line is with his spyglass.

426
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160
And he's moving the steering wheel to try and get the rudder in place

427
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
to get us a good angle to make sure that when we get to the starting line

428
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,160
we've got a good starting shot to roll out on.

429
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
That sounds good. So we've got four ships total.

430
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
You're in control of two of them.

431
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:49,160
And then we have the ship known as the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.

432
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
Nice work.

433
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,160
The powdered wig flag.

434
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,160
The cannon on the flag is wearing a powdered wig.

435
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,160
They are lined up very inside track on this race.

436
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,160
And then the port deserters, which is the Union Jack flag

437
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,160
with a bottle embroidered over the top of it.

438
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,160
The port deserters are much further away from the island.

439
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,160
They are betting on the speed of their ship.

440
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,160
And you know these ex-military guys have an incredibly fast ship.

441
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,160
So they're taking the outside track to try to avoid combat.

442
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Finally, the Swingsing brothers.

443
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Everything I said earlier was wrong.

444
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,160
There are actually five ships total.

445
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
That would make more sense for sure.

446
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,160
The other one is the music notes that are flinging themselves off of a ship on their flag.

447
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,160
They are known as the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam.

448
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,160
And they are also lined up pretty close to the island.

449
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Sort of close to the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.

450
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,160
And so from inner to outer, what's the...

451
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,160
First would be fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.

452
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,160
Next, pretty close by within range is the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam.

453
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,160
And then there's a lot of space.

454
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Like multiple cannon ranges between them and the port deserters.

455
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
And where are we?

456
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Where are you?

457
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Yeah, that's what we're talking about right now.

458
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Oh, okay.

459
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
He just laid out where the other ships are.

460
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
So we can decide now where do we want to put ourselves between which two ships.

461
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I'm pretty confident in my ability to run this crews firing squad.

462
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Firing squad? Not really.

463
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
I mean...

464
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Offensive line. How about that?

465
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I'll just be back here on the tight end.

466
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Mitch says as he heads to the stern.

467
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I think we start in the middle and we immediately start shooting.

468
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,160
By middle, do you want to be closer to the port deserters?

469
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
They're the ones who are kind of far outside now.

470
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I think we should mob the weakest with our superior numbers.

471
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Send them to the bottom of the sea.

472
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,160
I think we let the weak ones take care of each other and we go after the...

473
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
We know that those guys are going to be fast, so we take them down fast.

474
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,160
We don't know who's going to be fast, do we?

475
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,160
When I was describing the port deserters, I described their ship as, you know...

476
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
They're ex-military and they're very fast.

477
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
We know who's going to be fast, yes.

478
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,160
But I say let the strongest weaken themselves out.

479
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,160
We pick off the weak slim pickings, then we come up on the remainders.

480
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Whoever's left.

481
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Well, I think we let the losers take care of themselves and we fight our number one competition.

482
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,160
We also have the advantage of two ships, so we can have the neckbeard run interference anywhere we want.

483
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,160
That's always the advantage, but we can also mob any one ship.

484
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I have complete and the utmost confidence in the ability of Jesus Christ to sink the weak ships.

485
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I think we take after the Dusty Pirates or whatever they're called.

486
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,160
I imagine they're all quite Dusty Pirates.

487
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,160
I knew it was something to do with music notes, but I forgot what they were called.

488
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
The Dusty Pirates?

489
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
What are they called?

490
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
The Swing Sing Brothers?

491
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
That's what I said.

492
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Yeah, the Dusty Pirates.

493
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
What?

494
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
What?

495
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,160
I don't know where Dusty came from, but that's what I was referring to, was the Sing Swing Brothers.

496
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
But what were you saying about the Swing Swing Brothers?

497
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,160
We should follow them and we should take them, because they're going to be the fastest.

498
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
No, it's the port deserters who are the fastest.

499
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,160
That's the deserters.

500
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
That's why I said Dusty.

501
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Dusty Pirates.

502
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Hey, I'm just here to shoot shit.

503
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Right.

504
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Right.

505
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,160
So why don't you tend to your guns and leave the strategy to Mr. Adler?

506
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:43,160
He leaves the strategy huddle to make sure that his guys are all ready to shoot on his command.

507
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:50,160
My vote was to have our sister ship now, the Neckbeards, take out some aggression there

508
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
on the port deserters.

509
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
They're the ones who are going to get the lead.

510
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,160
We don't want them to get the lead, because if they get the lead, they're going to keep the lead.

511
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,160
And then I think that, as far as we are concerned, maybe put ourselves kind of distant from the other two?

512
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Well, the whole idea is to get there first, to make a circle first, right?

513
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Which the port deserters are going to do if we don't stop them.

514
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
That's what I'm saying.

515
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:18,160
So we take care of them, and then Jesus and Miss Sword are going to take, Miss Knife, whatever the name is,

516
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,160
is going to take care of the ones that aren't our competition.

517
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,160
And then once we take care of the fast boys, we are the fast boys, and we just complete the race.

518
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,160
What of these fancy pants? How do we make of their capabilities?

519
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,160
I want to get out my spyglass and maybe do a spot hidden or an appraisal.

520
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Yeah, I want to help with that.

521
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,160
Yeah, absolutely.

522
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I'd like to spot hidden, but for what their offensive capabilities are.

523
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I pass for sure. Let's see if I get a crit.

524
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I do not.

525
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
We got a pass from Wavy Adler.

526
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Pass for Edward Spitz.

527
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
I got a 44 and a 45.

528
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Can we just blanket this, the other ships, not just the pyromancy?

529
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Absolutely.

530
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,160
And we got a crit from Al.

531
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Alabaster.

532
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:13,160
As you look at the ship Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea, you see that their canons are massive, and they have lots of them.

533
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
This thing is weighed down.

534
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,160
It is not going to be particularly fast. That's why they've taken the inside track.

535
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,160
However, their canons fire at an absurdly long range given the length of their barrels.

536
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,160
We should put the neckbeards between them and us.

537
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:37,160
When you see the Port Deserters ship, you see that they are all just chilling and drinking on deck.

538
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:45,160
And they are already celebrating their victory with how deeply fast their ship is.

539
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:53,160
The Swingsing Brothers are already preparing for acrobatics and sword fighting.

540
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,160
They are getting fully in mode to engage.

541
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:06,160
They seem to be directing their rudder directly at Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea to go directly toward them right at the top.

542
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,160
So we put the neckbeards between the Fancy Damned Sea's guns and our holes.

543
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,160
And we make, like you lot are saying, for the Port Deserters.

544
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
The Dusty Pirates?

545
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
No.

546
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Port Deserters.

547
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,160
I'm going to keep calling them that.

548
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,160
You're going to be telling your men to shoot at the wrong things.

549
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,160
The Port Deserters were on the outside?

550
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah, and they're the fastest ship.

551
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
I really should have brought my whiteboard, that's my bad.

552
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
No, this is fine.

553
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,160
Gentlemen, I think both of our ideas have some merit here.

554
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,160
We put the Port Deserters between us and...

555
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Nope, they're on the outside.

556
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Yes, exactly.

557
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
We can be even farther out.

558
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Oh, we can be farther out than them?

559
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
We're on their outside.

560
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,160
And then between us and those scary guns, the neckbeards are there too.

561
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Agreed.

562
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Us, Deserters, neckbeards, Swinksing Bros, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.

563
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,160
I think we should take both of our boats after the Port Deserters.

564
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Can we talk about our ship a little bit?

565
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,160
How do we feel about compared to these other boats, our speed?

566
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Let's just say that.

567
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,160
How do we feel compared to these other boats as far as our speed compares to their speeds?

568
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I would say, what's your rope use score?

569
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,160
I gave myself, in Kala Cthulhu, or Pulp Cthulhu, it's drive wagon slash coach.

570
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,160
I just crossed that out and called it ship and said 70.

571
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Oh, okay.

572
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Then we'll use that 70.

573
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:35,160
So you would consider yourself 10% slower than the fastest ship and 10% faster than

574
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,160
the next slowest, but then quite a bit faster than Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.

575
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Right, right, right, right.

576
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,160
The reason I brought that up is just to think about that inside track that the fancy is

577
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
using, if we wanted to get closer like that.

578
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,160
But with just being 10% behind Port Deserters, yeah, I don't think it matters.

579
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
You guys have a fast crew, a fast ship.

580
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Yeah.

581
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Would you call the Fancy Pyromancy, if you had to like rate maybe what like their cannons

582
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
and stuff were?

583
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,160
A hundred, the way it sounded.

584
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Yeah, you got it.

585
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Yeah, I think that's a good idea then.

586
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,160
If you want to put us on the outside of the deserters.

587
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Mob the deserters.

588
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,160
And if it seems like any of the others are, you know, maybe pulling away from their scuff

589
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
while we send the neckbeards after them.

590
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
Look at it.

591
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
Look at it.

592
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Look at the Sling Sling brothers.

593
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Look at their rudder.

594
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
That's pointed right at the pyromancers.

595
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,160
They've been pyromancies in some fancy business for a little while.

596
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Exactly.

597
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
I think the guys on the inside are going to take care of themselves.

598
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,160
And then they'll at least keep each other busy and we can deal with the deserters.

599
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,160
The smoke signal from the middle of the island changes from black to a white smoke.

600
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,160
Oh fuck.

601
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Go, go, go.

602
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
As if a poop has been chosen.

603
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Foesail, catch the wind.

604
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Al runs down into the basement so he can light the pirate light, which helps with all the

605
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
lights on the ship.

606
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,160
And gives a boost to Joe's pilot score.

607
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,160
No, the pirate light.

608
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
His pirate score, yeah.

609
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I said pirate score.

610
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
We all said pirate.

611
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Spitz is kind of doing what he's been doing this whole time, which is just like sending

612
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
people to the right place.

613
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,160
But he's also not quite as effective as he might be in this case because even though

614
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,160
our ship does not have a captain, he makes sure no one goes near the captain's cabin.

615
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,160
It's unoccupied but he's like, it won't always be that way.

616
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,160
He just really, his only desire is to serve a hierarchy.

617
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Oh then I should have given you a captain, my bad.

618
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
No, that's my character arc.

619
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
He's going to find his captain.

620
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Al runs back up from lighting the pirate light and he starts yelling at everybody like,

621
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Man the cannons!

622
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Are we close enough to hit them?

623
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Al!

624
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Alabaster!

625
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Signal to the backbears!

626
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
They need to open fire too!

627
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Crowbar!

628
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Crowbar runs up the mast pretty slowly because of the density that he's carrying up there.

629
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,160
It's like watching a giant move where it's like moving a lot but slowly.

630
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:10,160
And eventually like fucking Yadier Molina trying to steal second this...

631
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
You mean super duper fast?

632
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
That's cool.

633
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,160
This chonker knows exactly how to do what it's doing.

634
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Like Albert Pujols moving into second on Fielder's Indifference.

635
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
That's right.

636
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:31,160
And so the monkey crowbar changes out a green flag for a red flag with a white stripe in it.

637
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Which is the signal to the other ship.

638
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,160
And you see in the distance Jesus Christ throws up the affirming flag on the ship of Neckbeard.

639
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,160
And so I need a sailing roll from Mr. Wavey Adler.

640
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,160
That's a pass with a nine.

641
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Okay.

642
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Pass with an eight.

643
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Oh!

644
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Fuck yeah!

645
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Slightly better jump.

646
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
Damn.

647
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Oh no!

648
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
We get it.

649
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
We get it.

650
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
We're above in the contest.

651
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
The port deserters were drinking so our cannon fire startles them.

652
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Oh fuck!

653
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,160
That and then also just yeah like they're over fucking confident.

654
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
They're cocky.

655
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Because I noticed them like drinking on board and kind of spilling all over the place I've

656
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:20,160
loaded up a couple of the cannons with just like molotov kind of cannon balls to make

657
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
fire.

658
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Should we?

659
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,160
I guess we could even do this now in podcast time or we could cut back but we didn't talk

660
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,160
about how we set up our orator and the barrel in the back.

661
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Oh yeah let's do that.

662
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,160
We'll have to have a little talk with Mitch before.

663
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Mitch takes the barrel and heaves it kind of rolls it over each side as he makes his

664
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,160
way back to the stern of the death of a salesman.

665
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,160
As he hits the stairs going up to that back deck he kind of looks around for anyone's

666
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
help.

667
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Oh Mitch Mitch!

668
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Mitch!

669
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
It's me Mr. Spitz.

670
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Oh hey Mr. Spitz.

671
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Can you help me carry this barrel back to the stern and get it ready?

672
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Yeah yeah of course.

673
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Anything for you my boy.

674
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Oh man you're so nice to me.

675
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm really worried.

676
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Alright.

677
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,160
He begins helping you kind of carry it back there and you guys get it to the back and

678
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,160
kind of get it ready and set up the bunghole to be perfectly.

679
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,160
I've got a Marlin's bike ready to drive into that the second the smoke goes off but he

680
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,160
turns around and he pauses like Mitch why are you worried?

681
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:36,160
I'm just I think that um it's a lot of like I don't know do you do you believe in magic?

682
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
I do.

683
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,160
He like parts his vest to reveal all manner of like superstitious charms like crucifixes

684
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,160
just everything any anything he might imagine would bring him some luck in his pirate life

685
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,160
and he's like of course I do Mitch all pirates believe in magic and he gets a twinkle in

686
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:00,160
the side.

687
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,160
At that point Al walks out with like a giant length of rope and is like looking around

688
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
for something to tie him to.

689
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Were these tattoos on your chest or were they trinkets that you had like a neck on necklaces?

690
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Oh there's there's trinkets there's tattoos there's essential scars nice yeah essential

691
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,160
yeah no he's got some crystals and essential oils dangling down from there he's got a he's

692
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,160
got a Himalaya salt crystal lamp in his wig.

693
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
He's got Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial.

694
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:41,160
I just think that um yeah no that's good that's really that's really good Mr. Spitz.

695
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Hold on one moment Mitch and he collects some crystals that he was charging on the railing.

696
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:54,160
If all moonlight's not you understand.

697
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:01,160
He looks back and he's just like I really um yeah no I think that'll be uh I think that'll

698
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,160
be helpful for you you know uh just keeping your keeping your head on your shoulders keep

699
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:16,160
your marbles you know all right okay um am I gonna fall back am I gonna fall off this

700
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
thing back here?

701
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Mitch have you ever been on a boat?

702
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
Yeah I got here on a boat.

703
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
You know how to stand?

704
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Yeah yeah I've been standing for a while yeah.

705
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Al comes out with some rope and he's like oh could you stand maybe right up against

706
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
that pole right next to you?

707
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Wait wait wait no no no give him some length you know we want him to.

708
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
We don't want him falling off this boat.

709
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,160
That's why you give him some length you fool.

710
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,160
This pirate balls are about to be throwing that's what we call cannon balls.

711
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Pirate balls, pirate balls gonna be flowing.

712
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,160
We want Mitch to be able to dart from side to side but still.

713
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
From side to side.

714
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,160
When Al came out with the rope his intention was to just like completely secure him to

715
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:05,160
a pole but he's been convinced otherwise so uh he he he ties the rope kind of like like

716
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,160
in a harness around his like arms and gives him about 10 feet of rope but like enough

717
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,160
that if he fell off like only half of his body would be off the ship like he wouldn't

718
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
fall very far falling off.

719
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I think now is the perfect time for the smoke to change yeah?

720
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Yeah.

721
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Smoke to go off.

722
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Luke go ahead and roll a heavy what is your skill called?

723
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,160
It's called uh heavy weapons and I got a 48 on an 80.

724
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Hey that'll do it okay cool uh go ahead and roll a d8.

725
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Luke just signaled uh four fingers to Zach.

726
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,160
And Zach moved his head toward Luke's microphone.

727
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Alright cool so um Thomas as the ship lurches forward the sails are filled.

728
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Every single one of these massive pieces of cloth is taut in the in the heavy wind of

729
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,160
this summer day and it just pushes you forward and it's almost as if you like.

730
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,160
It's like the wind's blowing so hard that it's like crazy.

731
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,160
The ship lurches forward and in that moment as we begin you know what you must do.

732
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Yeah Edward Spitz takes a very practiced hand to his mallet you know in the marlots bike

733
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,160
and busts open the bunghole and lets that liquid spray out the back.

734
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,160
And immediately the smell of iron hits your nose as blood begins pouring out the back

735
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:46,160
of the ship and your cannons go firing off and you see the port deserters head off to

736
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
a start just about even with you.

737
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,160
You're dead neck and neck and your cannons are firing through the whole of their ship

738
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:01,160
and on the other side you see that neckbeard ship unfortunately has not gotten the sails

739
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
up and ready to go yet.

740
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
They have not caught wind.

741
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,160
However the swing singers are off to a decent start.

742
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,160
The fancy pyromancy on the DMC lurches like they got a fucking Mario Kart boost because

743
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:21,160
they rolled a critical success and they jump to an early lead on the inside track as their

744
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:33,160
cannons sink us and end the game.

745
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,160
You see wood splinters flying off the ship of the swing sing brothers and you notice

746
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,160
that a couple of them who are up in the air.

747
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
What are they called?

748
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
What is a wooden part called?

749
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
A mast.

750
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
A mast.

751
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,160
The mast that a couple of them are hanging from is just obliterated to the point to where

752
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:03,160
it flies off the deck into the water dragging to these acrobatic pirates down into the water

753
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
with it.

754
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
People are screaming.

755
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Smoke is covering the entirety of the racing track.

756
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Oh isn't it a beautiful day Mitch?

757
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Oh yeah it's pretty nice out actually today.

758
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm at the blood and screams.

759
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,160
Oh yeah and he throws up.

760
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,160
Alabaster throws up for the second time today after seeing that.

761
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
Alright alright get your stomach in order boys.

762
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
It's time to start using your words.

763
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
I don't like using my words.

764
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
I like using my guns.

765
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Use those guns Alabaster.

766
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,160
As Mitch wipes his mouth he takes a few deep breaths and begins.

767
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,160
For a while in here.

768
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,160
For a while in here.

769
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,160
For a while in here.

770
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Miss Knife.

771
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,160
We could also have Jesus Christ and Miss Knife team up to captain the ship.

772
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
That's right.

773
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
Who is Jesus Christ?

774
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
That's my monkey.

775
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
