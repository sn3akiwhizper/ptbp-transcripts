0.00 187.00 speaker0  Oh, children, children, gather round ye old grease pit, for it is time for Uncle Wolfie to tell you all his special secrets. But first, remember, Uncle Wolfie is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP whenever and wherever I am's best radio station. Possibly the only one, depending on when and where I reside, dimensionally speaking, of course. But no matter the dimension, I always love hearing from y'all on our special segment, Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At TD Underscore Beck, who tweeted about the show and tagged At Pretending Pod. You can do that too if you want, right now, while I read this message even. Go on and do it. But also, listen. They answer my call gladly. And then, we feed.
177.00 257.00 speaker1  At five points around this circular moat, shallow pools the size of coffins held a sort of collateral for each pirate crew.
249.00 309.00 speaker0  It's R slash recruiting hell, and it's R.I. Peter with cruisin'.
303.00 336.00 speaker2  you'll be right at home. We've got a couple dirtbags working here. And then I sent him a picture of my face on the Wheatus's guy's face and said, I'm just a late 20s dirtbag baby. And then I tweeted it later. Yeah, it was a good tweet.
335.00 340.00 speaker3  That's right.
339.00 352.00 speaker2  That's right.
351.00 355.00 speaker3  And in order to-
352.00 364.00 speaker2  Noiled it. Noiled it.
363.00 378.00 speaker3  A complete circle.
377.00 405.00 speaker2  Day. This day. That's very irony. Yeah. And as I say that, I hand him one of- I've taken one of Dr. Shark's legs before they put him in the pod.
403.00 424.00 speaker3  He's got two peg legs. Oh, right. You've been playing too much The Forest.
422.00 456.00 speaker2  tightly around Jimmy. Nice. And so now he's legged. Like you're heading out to sea right now. Now we're on the tendy, heading back to the main ship.
453.00 496.00 speaker3  He's kind of the elder statesman of the ship that people kind of look to him for kind of general things there. But one of the things that he prides himself on is his navigation skills. And so running a circle around this island is right up his alley. He's got a spring in his step. He's like pulling out his spyglass and making sure that it's all in order as he's walking along. He's wiping the lens off on his tattered gross jacket, maybe even licking it, making sure that it's all spit-shined up there at the front there. And he's like-
495.00 523.00 speaker2  No, I think you're a good-looking man. I'm just a creep. I'm a weirdo, Mitch. You guys are my weirdos. We're gonna win.
518.00 561.00 speaker3  Listen, what exactly is the prize? We get a job, right? Is that some kind of ironic like catch thing where like she will be embarrassed, but we don't actually get any treasure? Uh, Elizabeth. No, that's not what I was-
558.00 579.00 speaker2  Because it's June, that's right. Yes, June. Right, so Mitch.
578.00 599.00 speaker3  Oh. Oh. Oh! He only looks at the world through like items of value.
598.00 622.00 speaker2  Uh, five. they seem to have enough, but then again, the human condition wants more, so. They're just like those Hammonds.
615.00 625.00 speaker3  The process of that appraisal is Spitz very creepily sniffing at him. Yeah. And then like-
624.00 645.00 speaker2  You're getting smells you've never smelled before. And with a 69, Joe Wavy Adler has this feeling right down in his little pilot bullet. Little pilot Barry. Little pilot Barry.
644.00 650.00 speaker3  Makes your little pirate bird twitch.
649.00 652.00 speaker2  Pilot Barry?
650.00 665.00 speaker3  My pilot Barry's feeling weird.
662.00 684.00 speaker2  be had after this competition. However, you get the sense that both of them have a steady, heavy amount of mistrust for the father figure of the family, which is also the father of the family. And his name was?
682.00 699.00 speaker3  Wavy was the one that clocked that it was the Diggorys, right? Yep. Diggory, right? I remember you guys. You guys used to be from the old days. You guys have been gone for a while.
698.00 737.00 speaker2  What? It's Mitch Diggory and Doug Diggory. Doug, it's you. You talking to the mom? Doug is the dad. Or at least what I said his name is. No, his name is definitely Doug. You're 100% right. Of course. We had to make it look like we had disappeared. Is that what Doug tells you? Yes.
735.00 749.00 speaker3  He appraises that joke.
747.00 755.00 speaker2  We know where it is. We just don't have a crew that can attain it.
753.00 757.00 speaker3  Now it's all coming together.
755.00 765.00 speaker2  They want to buy the best crew.
763.00 804.00 speaker3  Oh, it's our pirate cat. I'm looking at the quality of the fabric and the smell of the perfumes in our boy Mitch's hair. If it's a treasure that would tempt even these richy riches. Should we cut his hair off? Mr. Spence gets very jealous.
803.00 836.00 speaker2  Wait, no, no, no. He doesn't. No, the parrot just told me to. Yes. Mrs. Knife said it. And like taking all of his hair. What?
835.00 844.00 speaker3  Yeah, Mrs. Knife. We're on a boat with Keith.
842.00 880.00 speaker2  Yeah, it's definitely Mrs. Knife's fault, honestly. He wasn't going to do it if he wasn't instructed to, but he heard somebody say- Cut it off. And so he did. bit to Mr. Spitz and hands a little bit over to Waverly as well.
878.00 904.00 speaker3  Oh, of course. It's yours after all. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
903.00 906.00 speaker2  That's cool. And then they do like ponytails sometimes.
905.00 910.00 speaker3  There's top knot monks. Yeah.
907.00 920.00 speaker2  But I'm imagining that just like with spit. Top knot monks. He's a top knot monk now.
913.00 959.00 speaker3  And he says, do you guys have any mirrors on the death of a salesman? Look around you. The whole thing's a mirror. So no. He sees himself with no hair. Oh, okay. Don't worry. Oh good. We don't much like contemplating our parents.
955.00 1012.00 speaker2  Before we get on the death of a salesman, I think we're about to fight for our lives. So I think some more paint is going to be apt at this point. And he kind of wets his hands in the ocean, sticks his hands into his pockets, which have gunpowder in them. And he with like wet gunpowder on his hands, like puts it onto the now bald Mitch for some So for Mitch, he has gunpowder war paint with just like hands on like the side of his head, on his face and head. For me, I do the same and just kind of do underneath the eyes, like football style.
1006.50 1019.00 speaker3  Do you break one of your like massive boils on your face when you know the gunpowder rubs
1017.00 1045.00 speaker2  the gunpowder into his open wounds. then he, he puts his hands back down. Uh, and so then I like reapply the wet gunpowder and look at you guys. I'm like seeing if kind of gauge in if you want any or not.
1044.00 1066.00 speaker3  Oh no, thanks. I'm full. to do Mitch's war paint.
1061.00 1081.00 speaker2  Get them wet and I open up my pocket full of gunpowder so that you can get your hands wet and do more war paint to yourself and to, to Mitch. It's not the same.
1080.00 1099.00 speaker0  Uh, what was his name? Neckbeard.
1092.00 1124.00 speaker3  but we're more of a pirate democracy and we've elected some captains of our own for your ship.
1120.00 1138.00 speaker2  side of the ship and lands directly in the Tindy. Yeah. And then the pirate lands on the monkey's shoulder. The pirate? That's what I said. The pirate. That was a horrible accent.
1134.00 1140.00 speaker3  Mrs North is as much pirate as any of us. Exactly.
1139.00 1218.00 speaker2  She's a pirate parrot. Jesus Christ, the Emperor Tamarin monkey full mustache comes swooping in into the Tindy and then the parrot lands on his shoulder. Moving on. We're on the boat right now, right? Would you like to play the monkey? the new images of Jesus Christ and Mrs. Knife, they're, they're gonna run the other boat, Yeah. Yeah. Are we on the boat currently right now? I'm going to go up here real quick and then we'll basically start with you guys like on the boat. Okay. Description going.
1213.00 1230.00 speaker3  the ship and if you haven't, so like what if it knows semaphore and you can signal to it and shit. That's pretty good. Yeah.
1227.00 1233.00 speaker2  The other monkey can help me do that.
1230.00 1249.00 speaker3  They do it to each other.
1248.00 1264.16 speaker2  been running through my head. Like what? Jesus Christ is monkey number one. What's the name of the other monkey? Mary Magdalene. See, I was thinking biblical, but I thought it would be funnier.
1262.16 1313.16 speaker3  Jesus Christ and shit monkey. Santa. As Mrs. Diggory is rolling away, Edward spits, like leans over the railing and shouts, and
1304.16 1407.16 speaker2  and daytime that it is out currently, clear blue water below this whole 10D sky above, Mrs. Diggory shivers. I want you to tell me a little bit more about your ship and how it fares in battle. So he walks into the door on the ship and goes down into kind of the underbelly of the ship. He's probably got like the front quarter of the ship underneath is his like little living area slash like laboratory. And there's like gunpowder and different like, you know, kind of chemically looking stuff in there. Mostly it all looks like it's about to like a lighter goes off and the whole thing explodes. I love that. But he walks in and he's got, you know, his like meticulously made bed and everything. And then he goes over into the corner and there's a cage. One cage is empty and one cage has Emperor Tamarin monkey in it. Well, you can see the cages are kind of like on top of each other and the top one says Jesus Christ. Yeah. And the other one says crowbar.
1404.16 1409.16 speaker3  Okay. Awesome.
1407.16 1438.16 speaker2  It's because he likes to primate. He gets crowbar out.
1435.16 1448.16 speaker3  Like little monkey tattoos. Jesus Christ is live. Crowbar is jacked.
1445.16 1463.16 speaker2  Crowbar is, he's like four times as heavy. So like when he's on my shoulder, it's like weighs me down.
1461.16 1465.16 speaker3  He's bit everyone on board.
1463.16 1497.16 speaker2  It's like a ferocious toddler. Whispers, whispers, thread, like up the decks. Until Jesus went off to captain another ship.
1495.16 1501.16 speaker3  This is why we trusted Jesus to do it.
1499.16 1513.16 speaker2  Jesus was a great monkey. He is a great monkey. I come back up onto the deck and I see Waverly.
1511.16 1542.16 speaker3  Waverly's getting prepared for what we're doing. So he's up there making sure that all the crew men are getting to their stations. He's probably calling out. I don't know ship call outs. Oh, just do one. And he's moving the steering wheel to try and get the rudder in place to get us a good angle to make sure that when we get to the starting line we've got a good starting shot to roll out on.
1540.16 1644.16 speaker2  You're in control of two of them. And then we have the ship known as the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea. Nice work. The cannon on the flag is wearing a powdered wig. They are lined up very inside track on this race. And then the port deserters, which is the Union Jack flag with a bottle embroidered over the top of it. The port deserters are much further away from the island. They are betting on the speed of their ship. And you know these ex-military guys have an incredibly fast ship. So they're taking the outside track to try to avoid combat. Finally, the Swingsing brothers. Everything I said earlier was wrong. There are actually five ships total. The other one is the music notes that are flinging themselves off of a ship on their flag. They are known as the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam. And they are also lined up pretty close to the island. Sort of close to the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea. And so from inner to outer, what's the... And then there's a lot of space. Like multiple cannon ranges between them and the port deserters. And where are we? Where are you?
1643.16 1655.16 speaker3  Oh, okay. He just laid out where the other ships are. So we can decide now where do we want to put ourselves between which two ships.
1653.16 1674.16 speaker2  Firing squad? Not really. I mean... Offensive line. How about that? I'll just be back here on the tight end. Mitch says as he heads to the stern. I think we start in the middle and we immediately start shooting.
1672.16 1687.16 speaker3  They're the ones who are kind of far outside now. Send them to the bottom of the sea.
1684.16 1698.16 speaker2  We know that those guys are going to be fast, so we take them down fast. When I was describing the port deserters, I described their ship as, you know... They're ex-military and they're very fast.
1696.16 1728.16 speaker3  We know who's going to be fast, yes. But I say let the strongest weaken themselves out. We pick off the weak slim pickings, then we come up on the remainders. Whoever's left. That's always the advantage, but we can also mob any one ship.
1721.16 1744.16 speaker2  I have complete and the utmost confidence in the ability of Jesus Christ to sink the weak ships. I think we take after the Dusty Pirates or whatever they're called. The Dusty Pirates? What are they called? The Swing Sing Brothers?
1743.16 1764.16 speaker3  That's what I said. Yeah, the Dusty Pirates.
1763.16 1783.16 speaker2  That's why I said Dusty. Dusty Pirates. Hey, I'm just here to shoot shit. Right. Right.
1776.16 1818.16 speaker3  He leaves the strategy huddle to make sure that his guys are all ready to shoot on his command. My vote was to have our sister ship now, the Neckbeards, take out some aggression there on the port deserters. They're the ones who are going to get the lead. We don't want them to get the lead, because if they get the lead, they're going to keep the lead. And then I think that, as far as we are concerned, maybe put ourselves kind of distant from the other two?
1811.16 1840.16 speaker2  So we take care of them, and then Jesus and Miss Sword are going to take, Miss Knife, whatever the name is, is going to take care of the ones that aren't our competition. And then once we take care of the fast boys, we are the fast boys, and we just complete the race.
1839.16 1855.16 speaker3  Yeah, I want to help with that. Yeah, absolutely. I do not.
1853.16 1889.16 speaker2  Pass for Edward Spitz. I got a 44 and a 45. And we got a crit from Al. Alabaster. As you look at the ship Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea, you see that their canons are massive, and they have lots of them. This thing is weighed down. It is not going to be particularly fast. That's why they've taken the inside track. However, their canons fire at an absurdly long range given the length of their barrels.
1886.16 1905.16 speaker3  We should put the neckbeards between them and us.
1897.16 1933.16 speaker2  And they are already celebrating their victory with how deeply fast their ship is. The Swingsing Brothers are already preparing for acrobatics and sword fighting. They are getting fully in mode to engage. They seem to be directing their rudder directly at Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea to go directly toward them right at the top.
1926.16 1939.16 speaker3  So we put the neckbeards between the Fancy Damned Sea's guns and our holes.
1938.16 1962.16 speaker2  The Dusty Pirates?
1959.16 1963.16 speaker3  We put the Port Deserters between us and...
1962.16 1967.16 speaker2  Nope, they're on the outside. Yes, exactly. We can be even farther out. Oh, we can be farther out than them?
1966.16 1984.16 speaker3  We're on their outside.
1983.16 1989.16 speaker2  Can we talk about our ship a little bit?
1988.16 2015.16 speaker3  Let's just say that. Oh, okay. Then we'll use that 70.
2007.16 2024.16 speaker2  So you would consider yourself 10% slower than the fastest ship and 10% faster than the next slowest, but then quite a bit faster than Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.
2021.16 2033.16 speaker3  The reason I brought that up is just to think about that inside track that the fancy is using, if we wanted to get closer like that. But with just being 10% behind Port Deserters, yeah, I don't think it matters. You guys have a fast crew, a fast ship.
2032.16 2043.16 speaker2  Yeah. Would you call the Fancy Pyromancy, if you had to like rate maybe what like their cannons and stuff were?
2042.16 2047.16 speaker3  Yeah, you got it. Yeah, I think that's a good idea then.
2045.16 2054.16 speaker2  If you want to put us on the outside of the deserters. Mob the deserters.
2052.16 2056.16 speaker3  while we send the neckbeards after them.
2055.16 2059.16 speaker1  Look at it.
2058.16 2066.16 speaker3  That's pointed right at the pyromancers. They've been pyromancies in some fancy business for a little while.
2064.16 2076.16 speaker2  I think the guys on the inside are going to take care of themselves.
2075.16 2080.16 speaker3  Oh fuck. Go, go, go. As if a poop has been chosen.
2078.16 2095.16 speaker2  Foesail, catch the wind. Al runs down into the basement so he can light the pirate light, which helps with all the lights on the ship.
2092.16 2157.16 speaker3  No, the pirate light. I said pirate score. We all said pirate. Spitz is kind of doing what he's been doing this whole time, which is just like sending people to the right place. But he's also not quite as effective as he might be in this case because even though our ship does not have a captain, he makes sure no one goes near the captain's cabin. He's going to find his captain. Al! Alabaster! Signal to the backbears! They need to open fire too!
2152.16 2183.16 speaker2  Crowbar runs up the mast pretty slowly because of the density that he's carrying up there. That's cool.
2182.16 2191.16 speaker3  That's right.
2183.16 2215.16 speaker2  And so the monkey crowbar changes out a green flag for a red flag with a white stripe in it. Which is the signal to the other ship. And you see in the distance Jesus Christ throws up the affirming flag on the ship of Neckbeard. And so I need a sailing roll from Mr. Wavey Adler. Pass with an eight.
2214.16 2217.16 speaker3  Fuck yeah!
2216.16 2219.16 speaker4  Damn.
2218.16 2240.16 speaker3  We get it. We get it. We're above in the contest. The port deserters were drinking so our cannon fire startles them. They're cocky.
2233.16 2249.16 speaker2  loaded up a couple of the cannons with just like molotov kind of cannon balls to make
2246.16 2262.16 speaker3  about how we set up our orator and the barrel in the back.
2258.16 2273.16 speaker2  way back to the stern of the death of a salesman. As he hits the stairs going up to that back deck he kind of looks around for anyone's
2271.16 2280.16 speaker4  It's me Mr. Spitz.
2276.16 2323.16 speaker2  Can you help me carry this barrel back to the stern and get it ready? I'm really worried. kind of get it ready and set up the bunghole to be perfectly.
2317.16 2346.16 speaker3  He like parts his vest to reveal all manner of like superstitious charms like crucifixes just everything any anything he might imagine would bring him some luck in his pirate life
2340.16 2369.16 speaker2  At that point Al walks out with like a giant length of rope and is like looking around for something to tie him to.
2365.16 2407.16 speaker3  got a Himalaya salt crystal lamp in his wig. Hold on one moment Mitch and he collects some crystals that he was charging on the railing.
2401.16 2436.16 speaker2  be helpful for you you know uh just keeping your keeping your head on your shoulders keep your marbles you know all right okay um am I gonna fall back am I gonna fall off this thing back here?
2434.16 2453.16 speaker3  We don't want him falling off this boat. This pirate balls are about to be throwing that's what we call cannon balls. We want Mitch to be able to dart from side to side but still.
2452.16 2457.16 speaker4  From side to side.
2453.16 2531.16 speaker2  When Al came out with the rope his intention was to just like completely secure him to in a harness around his like arms and gives him about 10 feet of rope but like enough that if he fell off like only half of his body would be off the ship like he wouldn't fall very far falling off.
2525.16 2676.16 speaker4  this summer day and it just pushes you forward and it's almost as if you like. a start just about even with you. You're dead neck and neck and your cannons are firing through the whole of their ship and on the other side you see that neckbeard ship unfortunately has not gotten the sails up and ready to go yet. They have not caught wind. However the swing singers are off to a decent start. The fancy pyromancy on the DMC lurches like they got a fucking Mario Kart boost because that a couple of them who are up in the air. What are they called? What is a wooden part called? A mast. it flies off the deck into the water dragging to these acrobatic pirates down into the water with it. People are screaming. Smoke is covering the entirety of the racing track. I'm at the blood and screams.
2674.16 2678.16 speaker3  It's time to start using your words.
2676.16 2689.16 speaker2  I don't like using my words. I like using my guns.
2682.16 2701.16 speaker4  As Mitch wipes his mouth he takes a few deep breaths and begins.
2697.16 2716.16 speaker0  For a while in here.
2715.16 2720.16 speaker2  That's right. Who is Jesus Christ? That's my monkey. Thanks for watching.
