0	4400	We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode.
4400	9760	Because I'm sitting here and I'm like, I don't like being here.
9760	11240	Julius looks at...
11240	14040	Content warning, not fun.
14040	15040	This one?
15040	16040	Not so fun.
16040	18040	Not fun, man.
18040	22160	Let's go to an ad.
22160	23160	It's...
23160	24160	Wait, we're gonna...
24160	25160	Do we do an ad?
25160	26160	We're gonna go to an ad?
26160	27160	We do an ad?
27160	28160	We're gonna go to an ad.
28160	29160	An ad.
29160	31840	Hey, listeners!
31840	33880	And Joe and Thomas and Luke, I got some questions for you.
33880	37600	You need to go back, that automatically indicates the first bit I had.
37600	38600	What?
38600	41640	It's the start of your day peaceful...
41640	42640	What?
42640	43640	Hey, listeners.
43640	46440	Oh, are we the listeners?
46440	47440	Got it.
47440	48440	Fucking nailed it.
48440	49440	So good.
49440	57760	I got some questions for you.
57760	59240	Luke, is the start of your day peaceful?
59240	60240	No.
60240	64040	Are you tired of being scared awake by your alarm every day, Joe?
64040	65960	It's like waking up to a jump scare every morning.
65960	69400	Do you wake up feeling groggy as hell, Thomas?
69400	70400	Yeah.
70400	74440	Are you losing out on precious sleep because of your partner's different schedule?
74440	76440	Yeah, my freaking partner.
76440	77440	Not anymore.
77440	83680	Either way, I am.
83680	89200	That's why I must tell you about the hero of my morning, silent wake up.
89200	90200	Silent wake up?
90200	91200	Silent wake up?
91200	93680	I've heard of an angel of the morning, but a hero of the morning?
93680	95400	A hero of the morning.
95400	96700	What is silent wake up?
96700	100480	It's the having a sandwich for breakfast of the alarm clock game.
100480	101480	It is...
101480	102480	Is that in the copy?
102480	103480	No, it isn't.
103480	104480	You just gave him something free.
104480	105480	I don't know if you should say that.
105480	109280	Well, I don't know if it's good.
109280	112280	Having a sandwich is the best meal you can have, so having it in the morning...
112280	113280	That's not true.
113280	114760	I mean, I do like the...
114760	118520	Well, wrong.
118520	123520	The wearable alarm that gradually wakes you up using soothing vibrations and silent wake
123520	124600	up.
124600	130000	Sound alarms instantly wake you up by spiking your adrenaline and blood pressure, causing...
130000	131000	Oh, that's sound...
131000	132000	Okay, that's sound alarms.
132000	133000	Because I was like, that sounds bad.
133000	135000	I don't want that.
135000	136000	That is not this product.
136000	139920	That's like eating a turd sandwich for breakfast of the morning.
139920	140920	Yes.
140920	141920	Exactly.
141920	148680	That solution slowly transitions you from a deep to light sleep over 10 minutes before
148680	150960	gently awakening you.
150960	157120	That sounds better than like seven cell phone alarms every seven minutes.
157120	160720	It's like the nuclear meltdown sound and I'm like, God, now I gotta get up.
160720	165560	Do you feel shame when you've like hit the snooze like a certain amount of times?
165560	171840	I feel accomplishment, but I think this would eliminate that.
171840	176380	You can even personalize your morning with customizable modes for those heavy and light
176380	177380	sleepers out there.
177380	179520	Are you guys heavy or light sleepers?
179520	182720	Not getting a lot of sleep lately because normally I'm a very heavy sleeper, but lately
182720	185160	I'm a pretty light sleeper.
185160	189000	It's because I got a shitty mattress, so if we could get one of those on next.
189000	196400	Well, as much as you'll love your silent wake up, your partner will love it even more.
196400	197400	My partner?
197400	198600	I love thinking about them.
198600	203400	No longer will either of you be disturbed by the other's snooze addiction.
203400	205440	Does your snooze addiction affect your wife?
205440	209920	No, it doesn't because I wake up far later than she does.
209920	213360	And you wake up hours later and you wake up with a silent wake up.
213360	214560	That's right.
214560	216640	Without any noise whatsoever.
216640	220760	And I tried to scream, but I can't, it's just the ads don't have to be horror.
220760	221760	That's right.
221760	222760	That's right.
222760	223760	That's right.

242400	245920	The smarter wake up is a silent wake up.
245920	247920	Fucking nailed it.
247920	250600	Howdy there, my friends.
250600	258960	I just got back from my vacation back in the pirate times and have made my way all the
258960	264400	way back to the July 5th, 2022 times.
264400	269560	Damn, I miss those pirate oceans.
269560	275560	My fur though does not take kindly to the briny beast that is the ocean.
275560	278320	Gotta re-grease up my quills.
278360	284160	So welcome once again to the briniest broadcast this side of the Bermuda.
284160	287680	694.2 PTBP.
287680	295920	I am your loyal and humble host, Wolf the Dog, and you are my loyal listenership.
295920	298480	You sometimes write me things.
298480	301720	I sometimes read them.
301720	308680	This howlin' with Wolf is from Derek Enfargo N.D., who tweeted about the show and tagged
308680	313480	at Pretending Pod, a very cool thing you should do.
313480	320200	Derek Enfargo N.D. writes, Dear Wolf, you kooky bastards are the reason
320200	323640	I got my group to start playing D.G.
323640	329320	We at Fuckboys Central owe a debt to you for all we've gotten into.
329320	335440	From stealing a helicopter and killing a hand monster with hellfire missiles to having
335440	342440	a canoe-sized bomb dropped on an agent and explode the theater just as his bloody entrails
342440	345680	slopped out for a ritual sacrifice.
345680	355640	Shout out to Scoots, Danimal, Bozzie, Goofah, Cashew, Jesus, Matt, and your OG Fuckboy,
355640	356640	Drable.
356640	359160	Thanks for all the fish.
359200	366120	And thanks to you, Fargo Derek, I think your group has potential to go far.
366120	371880	If you want to write up something for your salty wolf to howl, just do a quick little
371880	379760	shout out to your favorites here at 694.2 PTBP and tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter
379760	385320	or Instagram, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star review on
385320	390240	the podcast app of your choice and send them screenshots.
390240	393520	The links are in the show notes.
393520	394520	Click them.
394520	395520	Cook them now.
395520	396600	Or after the show.
396600	399040	You just better look at them at the least.
399040	405200	Sorry, being back in 2022 has me on the edge of my mind's chair.
405200	408840	There's just so much more of the news.
408840	415080	Last time, right after Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Zach stood up from recording the end of
415080	422160	The Death of a Salesman, just like immediately after Zach stopped recording, Thomas exclaimed,
422160	426640	Holy shit, did we just create the Bermuda Triangle?
426640	431760	But back here in 2022, things aren't going so cool.
431760	438720	In the hidden, unnatural, Godel company town, Grover's Gorge, Fred Godel is nowhere to
438720	444360	be seen except on the screens in the train and the statue in front of the lab.
444360	452280	However, Vernon Covington, the landlord, has with a large audience accused Cal Colorado,
452280	459720	Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie of the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge,
459720	462440	a turtle named Sandro.
462440	469720	When the can crew spoke in resistance, they were the victims of Vernon Covington's relentless
469720	472160	vitriol and violence.
472160	478560	The latter was most harshly directed at Julius Summers, who lays on the ground bleeding like
478560	482480	a fountain from his face, barely conscious.
482480	489520	And that's when the landlord called for a specific punishment, stoned to death.
489520	498160	Taking us now to a conflictingly less-than-hell-yeah-dude moment, it's Altergirl with My Life is Great
498160	500560	and It's All My Fault.
519520	542240	Welcome back to Pretending to Be People, after a four-episode run as pirates.
542240	543240	Argh.
543240	545240	Here's what I'm thinking.
545240	546240	Oh, and 80s.
546240	553320	Bones are their money, and also their food, and that's it.
553320	556880	But what if the part that we already recorded isn't in here anymore?
556880	557880	Yeah.
557880	559880	We're gonna have to keep it in, then.
559880	560880	Argh.
560880	565240	We can just let that sit there.
565240	569960	Zach asked you to talk about pirates and- Pirates eat bones, maybe?
569960	573000	I can't remember if I got a solid argh- You can't say it never happened.
573000	574000	In the pirate ark.
574000	575000	I don't know if I got one in here.
575000	577000	Do you want to get one now?
577000	578000	Argh.
578000	579000	Go, Joe.
579000	581320	This is your one and wild argh.
581320	583120	Is that how you're gonna use it?
583120	584120	Argh.
584120	585120	Oh.
585120	586120	That was pretty good.
586120	587120	No, it wasn't.
587120	588120	Don't fucking...
588120	589120	Oh.
589120	590120	Oh.
590120	591120	Oh.
591120	592120	Oh.
592120	593120	Oh.
593120	594120	Oh.
594120	595120	Oh.
595120	596120	Oh.
596120	597120	Oh.
597120	598120	Don't coddle the boy.
598120	599120	I thought it was pretty good.
599120	600120	Give me an argh, motherfucker.
600120	601120	Argh.
601120	602120	What?
602120	603120	I didn't know if you pushed people aggressively and got better results.
603120	604120	Have you ever heard of Stanley Cooper?
604240	607240	Is Thomas Stanley Kubrick of this podcast?
607240	608240	No, no, no.
608240	610600	There's a difference between inspiration and abuse.
610600	614200	What I do is abuse.
614200	617280	Which ultimately provides better material.
617280	618280	Excellent.
618280	624800	Excellent short-term results.
624800	629040	He never wanted to do a shining too, so it's like he doesn't care what happens after.
629040	635200	He doesn't care what bridges I burn.
635200	636680	Jack, you're cool.
636680	637680	This lady, though...
637680	639200	What was her name?
639200	640200	Shelley Duvall.
640200	641200	Shelley Duvall.
641200	642200	Poor lady.
642200	643200	Poor, poor lady.
643200	644200	Yeah.
644200	646200	Seems like it was a bad time.
646200	647200	Yeah.
647200	649520	Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.
649520	650920	Have you seen that video?
650920	654280	No, I thought you were just playing character now on the show.
654280	656280	I was like, wow, bold choice.
656280	658280	Let's see where it goes.
658520	661520	What was shooting like?
661520	664520	She hosted some show that she was the...
664520	666520	Every intro, she said, hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.
666520	668520	And she said it in the exact same way.
668520	672520	So somebody made a compilation of her saying it a million times in a row.
672520	673520	It's really...
673520	674520	She's a fucking pro.
674520	675520	It's a fun video.
675520	676520	Yeah.
676520	677520	She's an ultra pro.
677520	678520	It's like perfect every time.
678520	679520	Whoa.
679520	685520	Do you think that we should like say the same thing at the beginning of all of our episodes?
685520	686520	Sure.
686520	687520	Yeah.
687760	689760	Fuck off, fuckaroos.
689760	694760	It's another episode of pretending to be people.
694760	696760	So, I mean, that's one idea.
696760	699760	It's kind of just Gabrus's what's up shit heads.
699760	703760	What if we just did the same thing every episode?
703760	704760	Every time.
704760	705760	The full episode?
705760	706760	From start to finish.
706760	707760	Yeah.
707760	709760	Episode one over and over and over again.
709760	711760	Hold on, I got to turn my heads down a little bit.
711760	712760	Until we get it right.
712760	713760	Can you reach it?
713760	714760	You can.
714760	716760	Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.
717000	719000	You fucking nailed it.
719000	722000	You said it the exact same way you said it last time.
722000	723000	That was crazy.
723000	724000	Well.
724000	725000	So, Zach.
725000	726000	I don't want to be a pirate.
726000	729560	We just got out of the pirate arch, which, holy shit, man, there were some things that
729560	730960	happened in there.
730960	735400	But before the pirates, an even crazier thing was happening to our characters in the real
735400	736400	world.
736400	739040	Nobody remembers that.
739040	742040	In the real world is a great way to say it.
742040	744300	In the present world.
744300	745760	In the not pirate world.
745760	746760	It is the real world.
746760	747760	It's just spooky.
747760	748760	It's just spooky.
748760	751760	This is all spooky.
751760	753440	Luke, what was happening at the end of the last episode?
753440	754440	Was Julius fine?
754440	760840	Oh, he was having just a fine day until he ran into...
760840	762720	You don't have it in your notes?
762720	764360	He just looked to everyone in the room.
764360	765920	He looked at it in his character sheet.
765920	766920	Joe, don't show him.
766920	768640	Were you looking for your name?
768640	769640	Your character's name?
769640	770640	Vernon.
770640	772780	Until he ran into Vernon.
772780	777500	And then he was not having such a great day anymore, because he's almost dead.
777500	780900	He was having about as bad a day as you can have.
780900	786940	I would say one point away from ending his day completely.
786940	791220	Have we ever taken a PC down to one hit point on the show before?
791220	801060	Taking a PC down to one hit point on the show before.
801060	805760	So I've turned my headphones down, but Luke is still peaking really hard for me.
805760	806760	That's the thing.
806760	808740	I'm louder than everybody else is, for sure.
808740	811220	I always forget he just talks way louder than everybody else.
811220	814000	Bing bong, bing bong, shooby dooby doop.
814000	815300	It's all that theater training.
815300	816300	He projects.
816300	817300	Yeah.
817300	823540	I think the mics just don't pick up the deeper, more powerful voices in the room as much as
823540	824540	they do the...
824540	831380	The whiny, little, shrill, annoying voices.
831380	836420	As someone who listens to all of us on a regular occasion, I'm constantly surprised by how
836420	841940	deep Luke's voice is still to this day when I'm editing, and I'm like, whoa, he got down
841940	842940	there.
842940	843940	Hello, dude.
843940	845940	Luke, give us an argh.
845940	846940	Argh.
846940	847940	Hmm.
847940	852940	I genuinely believe that's the best you can do.
852940	853940	Fuck.
853940	854940	Argh.
854940	855940	Argh.
855940	865340	See, you've got to tailor your abuse to each person to get the most out of them.
865340	868100	Jesus Christ.
868100	870700	I am afraid to argh.
870700	872860	Hey, Zach.
872860	873860	Yeah.
873860	874860	Mm-hmm.
874860	875860	Yeah.
875860	878620	Let's get this episode going, huh?
878620	879620	Yes, thank you.
879620	881180	Let us begin.
881420	883500	Well, I do like the...
883500	884500	Fuck.
884500	887980	You got me all riled up.
887980	891020	Lettuce, tomato, pickles and onions.
891020	897300	I want to go back and keep talking about where we were at the end of episode eight, because
897300	899940	that was a fair few moments ago.
899940	902460	I can sum it up in four words.
902460	903460	Okay.
903460	904460	Ouchie, ouchie.
904460	905460	Hell yeah.
905860	910260	Would you like to...
910260	914500	I think your forward explanation needs a slight explanation, but it is well done.
914500	915500	Yeah.
915500	920740	I think it's appropriate for listeners who remember what's going on, but entirely inappropriate
920740	921740	for the job of...
921740	922740	Catching anyone up.
922740	923740	Yeah.
923740	925420	That is my explanation.
925420	927860	Would somebody else like to give it a crack?
927860	930860	Julius hurt.
930860	931860	We're fucked.
931860	933860	Oh, we didn't need to...
934260	936260	I really appreciate the effort, but I...
936260	937460	It didn't have to be in four words.
937460	940820	It did not have to be in four words that time specifically.
940820	942420	But also very good job.
942420	943980	Yeah, super well done.
943980	944980	Four words, Joe?
944980	947980	Landlord, bang, bang, bang.
947980	948980	Yep.
948980	953980	Oh no, four words about the story.
953980	956980	You already told us what you were up to today.
956980	957980	Three times, wow.
957980	958980	Fucking your landlord.
961980	962980	Pretty impressive.
963980	964980	Thanks guys.
967980	968980	Three times, not bad.
968980	971620	Yeah, we're getting old.
971620	974620	What is your refraction period?
974620	976620	Refractory.
976620	981620	What is your refractory period?
981620	984620	What was that?
984620	990620	I was doing the same laugh I did the time before, but I just didn't have it in me that
990620	991620	time as much.
991620	993620	I thought you were trying to laugh in reverse.
994380	997380	Give us an R.
997380	1000380	I got it.
1000380	1002380	Yeah, nailed it in one.
1008380	1010380	So we killed the mayor.
1010380	1012380	We didn't kill the mayor.
1012380	1016380	The mayor, if he was killed by anybody...
1016380	1019380	The turtle mayor of this bullshit town committed suicide.
1020140	1022140	With the help of possibly...
1022140	1024140	God damn it.
1024140	1026140	Well, Julius did say he would watch it.
1026140	1032140	Well, Julius, I guess, but the guy, the guy who spoke for the mayor.
1032140	1034140	The guy who asked you to watch it?
1034140	1035140	Chuck.
1035140	1036140	Chuck.
1036140	1037140	Chuck Bidwell.
1037140	1040140	If anybody killed the mayor, it was Chuck Bidwell.
1040140	1043140	Turtle dies.
1043140	1044140	Other stuff.
1044140	1045140	Town mad.
1045140	1047140	Yeah, turtle dies, town mad.
1047900	1049900	That's the four words we were looking for.
1049900	1054900	Yeah, and then you guys came down and saw a very dry turtle corpse there on the ground
1054900	1061900	before you headed out and saw the crowd all staring at you angrily, almost rabid, to see
1061900	1063900	what happens to you.
1063900	1065900	There's your answer, Joe.
1065900	1067900	This is very similar to something that actually happened to me in preschool.
1067900	1069900	Whoa, what?
1069900	1075900	This girl brought a frog to school and was showing everybody on the playground and it
1075900	1080900	was all loose and everybody's looking for it and they all run up into this tree house
1080900	1085900	to look for it there and I'm standing near the bottom just looking around and they all
1085900	1091900	just point to this dead frog and they're like, look, you stepped on it.
1091900	1096900	I was like, I don't think, well, yeah, the mob turned on me.
1096900	1097900	Yeah.
1097900	1100900	You're right, this is almost exactly the same.
1100900	1101900	Yeah.
1101900	1103900	Why did you step on the frog, though?
1103900	1106900	I wanted to watch its light go out.
1106900	1108900	That's somehow better than wanting attention.
1108900	1110900	Also, he wanted to be the-
1110900	1113900	Wanted attention.
1113900	1115900	I'm the mayor of the playground now.
1115900	1118900	I'm the frog.
1118900	1120900	Watch me hop.
1120900	1123900	Why would they have thought that it went to the tree house?
1123900	1125900	Because it was a cool place to be.
1125900	1130900	Maybe they had a dead frog and wanted to prank me, I don't know, but everybody else rushed
1130900	1133900	up to this little tree house and yeah.
1133900	1135900	Frogs live in tree house.
1135900	1137900	Frogs live in tree house.
1137900	1138900	True frogs do.
1138900	1139900	Frogs live in tree house.
1139900	1140900	That's right.
1140900	1142900	And tree house frogs definitely do.
1142900	1146900	Anyway, then they stoned me to death.
1146900	1147900	Which is what we ended there.
1147900	1149900	One of the teachers came out.
1149900	1151900	Yeah, that's it.
1151900	1157900	So Vernon Covington, the landlord, put you in your place both verbally and physically,
1157900	1165900	and really did some serious damage to Julius and left him on the ground bleeding, coughing
1165900	1170900	up his own blood, sputtering, and maybe even teeth falling out.
1170900	1171900	I mean, it was bad.
1171900	1172900	It was a bad scene.
1172900	1179900	Before he, Vernon Covington, the landlord, did indeed call out to the judge and ask that
1179900	1184900	the four of you, the three of you, Julius, whatever your last name is-
1184900	1185900	Summers.
1185900	1186900	Caesar.
1186900	1187900	Julius the Simpsons.
1187900	1189900	I almost said Caesar so many times.
1189900	1190900	Summers.
1190900	1201900	Julius Summers, Beck Wilder, from Cal, Colorado, as well as Stevie, or as you know her.
1201900	1202900	Stevie Gotel.
1202900	1203900	Well.
1203900	1204900	Starts with an F.
1204900	1205900	Frank Gotel.
1205900	1206900	Yep, her name is-
1206900	1207900	Francis.
1207900	1208900	Francis Gotel.
1208900	1213900	No, I almost did that before I realized I did that name in season one, so I avoided
1213900	1214900	using those names.
1214900	1215900	Fox.
1215900	1216900	Yes.
1216900	1217900	Fox is the sun.
1217900	1220400	Fox is the name that the sun is going by these days.
1220400	1222900	He was the one that greeted us when we got here, right?
1222900	1223900	He is, yes.
1223900	1224900	Oh, wait.
1224900	1225900	That's Francis.
1225900	1226900	Faith.
1226900	1227900	Faith.
1227900	1229900	That was, dude, I took a lot of fucking notes in this crazy town.
1229900	1231900	That was a while back.
1231900	1233900	Yes, Faith Gotel.
1233900	1238380	Vernon Covington is asking also that Faith Gotel be stoned to death, although she is
1238380	1241340	very much still in disguise to everyone here.
1241340	1245380	Our last hope is Faith's friend.
1245380	1251060	Faith was kind of, was she iffy about whether or not the judge was on our side or not?
1251060	1252060	Yeah.
1252060	1260580	Yeah, iffy, but also mentioned that for the past year, Susan Bloom, the judge, has known
1260580	1268060	the whereabouts of Faith Gotel and hasn't turned on her yet, is what Faith said.
1268060	1269060	Right.
1269060	1272540	Maybe a friend, maybe saving her for something really juicy.
1272540	1273540	Yeah.
1273540	1274540	The right time to turn her in.
1274700	1275700	Yep.
1275700	1278340	That's the way this world goes, guys.
1278340	1282500	You don't know what's really in people's hearts, who you can trust, but I think most people
1282500	1283500	are good.
1283500	1286500	I'm sure hope this judge isn't.
1286500	1287500	Probably not this judge.
1287500	1294100	So, yeah, I'm laying down munching on my own teeth and drinking my own blood on accident
1294100	1295100	basically.
1295100	1296100	Whoa.
1296100	1297100	Fucking metal.
1297100	1298100	Hardcore, yeah.
1298100	1302920	Fucking hardcore.
1302920	1307440	In this moment, the world basically freezes in your minds.
1307440	1308840	It doesn't actually freeze.
1308840	1314280	I know this is a natural kind of game to where if I said that and meant it, it could mean
1314280	1319080	that it's real, but also I just mean, let's zoom into each of your minds real quick and
1319080	1322960	get an idea of where you are at.
1322960	1325440	What is rushing through your mind right now?
1325440	1332200	I mean, Beck was just bleeding profusely from his leg not 15 minutes ago, and he's been
1332200	1335640	cured seemingly, and now you've come out and seen this.
1335640	1336640	Oh, yeah.
1336640	1340960	We didn't mention it, but also we cured Cal's poison ivy because we forgot about that.
1340960	1341960	Oh, yeah.
1341960	1342960	Wow.
1342960	1345560	Good thing they used that machine.
1345560	1347800	That was a deleted scene.
1347800	1349000	I lied to you just now.
1349000	1350280	We didn't forget about it.
1350280	1351280	You just got cut.
1351280	1352280	Oh, we could easily put that in now.
1352280	1353280	It hasn't come out yet.
1353280	1354280	Somebody just comes in.
1354280	1355280	That's true.
1355280	1356280	Oh, that's true.
1356280	1357280	That's too much work.
1357280	1358280	Too much work.
1358280	1361280	But it happened.
1361280	1365760	Or something that doesn't need fixing because we already addressed it.
1365760	1366760	Oopsie.
1366760	1369240	I accidentally edited it out when I was drunk.
1369240	1370240	Whoops.
1370240	1371240	Uh-oh.
1371240	1373680	That trashcan buttons pops out of nowhere sometimes.
1373680	1374680	It's wild.
1374680	1380640	You know what Hemingway said, write drunk, edit drunk.
1380640	1383960	Play high.
1383960	1390320	It zooms into Julius's face, and a voiceover of Julius says, you're probably wondering
1390320	1393160	how I got here.
1393160	1396720	Say that through your blood and teeth.
1396720	1397720	Don't spill.
1397720	1402760	You're probably wondering how I got here.
1402760	1404120	I wish I knew.
1404120	1410520	Julius is, he's not really got much thoughts going on in his head other than like, ow,
1410520	1412240	and if I fall asleep I'll die.
1412240	1418320	Yep, those are the two things that makes all the sense in the world.
1418320	1422600	I feel like Beck up until this point was just kind of both weirded out but also really
1422600	1427120	into everything that's been happening so far and then he fell on a jackalope and that really
1427120	1428120	messed things up.
1428120	1436280	But I think this is, I think this is now it's hitting him that this isn't just like accidents
1436280	1437640	and hijinks and weirdness.
1437640	1440480	This is life or death.
1440480	1443440	This is, this is, this is no longer a news story.
1443440	1445200	So weirded out here.
1445200	1447240	This is all just a crazy misunderstanding.
1447240	1453920	It's not just the kind of place that can cure a deep wound out of nowhere, but it's also
1453920	1454920	the kind of place.
1454920	1457560	It's the kind of place where you could lose your life today.
1457560	1460920	And that's, that's, that's not, that's not what Beck signed up for.
1460920	1461920	Yeah.
1461920	1463720	What about Cal, Colorado?
1463720	1467160	Cal is like stunned.
1467160	1474000	He doesn't, he, he tried to make these appeals to like justice and rightness and the law
1474000	1482320	and like the power of journalism to shine light on dark places and got nothing.
1482320	1487360	And his head, he's, he's just rapidly like turning through different variations of those
1487360	1492640	ideas and like, what if I approached them this way and appealed to their civic duty
1492640	1495360	or like, yeah, but he's just grasping at straws.
1495360	1499960	Will you remind me, did, did, uh, Julius do something in particular to receive that wrath
1499960	1502640	or did we do something and he was the brunt of the...
1502640	1510640	I did, what did I, Oh, I tried to break his cane in half and I didn't do that.
1510640	1516800	And then he grabbed it and beat the shit out of me with it with my beautiful big thick
1516800	1517800	thighs.
1517800	1521360	I thought it would work flawlessly.
1521360	1523680	I planned this character for this exact moment.
1523680	1528240	I was like, will there be any cane wielding baddies?
1528240	1537760	Do we look at the face or watermelon people?
1537760	1540600	Just the normal role playing stuff.
1540600	1541600	You never know.
1541600	1542600	What's going to happen.
1542600	1543600	Hold on.
1543600	1545820	I got to rewrite the end of this.
1545820	1554880	As the mothership's doors open, the bulbous head of watermelon prime descends slowly down
1554880	1556560	stop this madness.
1556560	1566720	He says, you know, we're going to invent the watermelon people language and they're aliens.
1566720	1568840	So it's weird.
1568840	1573120	Well they're here for our seeds, which seeds they need to cross pollinate.
1573120	1577800	Their people are experiencing a children of men situation and they can't make seeds of
1577800	1578800	their own.
1578800	1580520	So they need our watermelon seeds.
1580520	1584040	You realize the first time you get one of those babies in between your thighs for too
1584040	1588840	long and you're like, they're seedless.
1588840	1595320	The reason they turn on us is they're like, what, what have you, you did this on purpose?
1595320	1599200	They actually go to war with us because the first one to land who came in peace, Julius
1599200	1605320	just like fucking raffles to the ground between his thighs and pops that fucker open.
1605320	1608440	I was made for this.
1608440	1612480	Oh, we're just putting off some bad things.
1612480	1613480	I don't wait.
1613480	1616240	Kill the frog.
1616240	1623560	Are you saying that we're just procrastinating because of the, I don't want to kill me Joseph
1623560	1624560	because I'm Stalin.
1624560	1625560	Oh my God.
1625560	1626560	All right.
1626560	1634240	Well we need to get Russian if we're going to get this episode done in time.
1634240	1635240	Communism.
1635240	1636240	Yeah.
1636240	1639240	We need to quit putting it off.
1639240	1641240	You'll laugh your yak off.
1642000	1646000	Oh, that was hammering circle.
1646000	1656160	All right, in Russia it says, or in America it says, in God we trust on the money in Russia.
1656160	1658960	We have no money.
1658960	1659960	That's Bobby Hills.
1659960	1660960	Yakov joke.
1660960	1661960	Yeah.
1661960	1665080	He sells it to Yakov for $20.
1665080	1671120	Last thing I'll say about Yakov Smirnoff is his, um, in Branson, his sign out in front
1671120	1675400	of his show says, laughter kills the COVID virus.
1675400	1676400	Wow.
1676400	1678720	Is it true?
1678720	1683440	I went to Yakov and I haven't had COVID since.
1683440	1684840	Dangerously false sec.
1684840	1685840	Oh, okay.
1685840	1686840	Fascinating.
1686840	1692640	Encouraging a crowd of mostly senior tourists to all expel as much air as we can in a closed
1692640	1693640	space.
1693640	1696000	I just listened to whoever talked to me last.
1696000	1698120	So I didn't know if it was true.
1698120	1699120	Oh, it's not.
1699120	1700120	Thank you.
1700120	1705560	Do you just want an earpiece?
1705560	1707240	So the watermelon people are invading.
1707240	1708240	Yeah.
1708240	1713480	So you guys are looking up at what is basically now the King of the Hill, Vernon Covington,
1713480	1720440	the landlord, as he is just smiling through these teeth that are fucking afraid of each
1720440	1721440	other.
1721440	1727360	They're so far apart and spit is just like dripping off one of his lips as he's looking
1727360	1729040	down at Julia Summers.
1729040	1731960	This guy sounds hot.
1731960	1737520	We see the faces of people in the crowd, people in yellow, people in green.
1737520	1744520	We see the two medical staff who spoke up to say that Julia Summers had tried to assault
1744520	1745720	them.
1745720	1753460	Pretty harsh character witness as everyone's eyes turn to the judge, Susan Bloom, who kind
1753460	1758280	of almost shakily steps forward and then quickly gains her confidence.
1758800	1763000	She's looking at the four of you, but you all kind of noticed, well, two of you kind
1763000	1770280	of noticed mostly that she's directing her gaze at Stevie, lip quivering.
1770280	1773440	Oh, hey, I didn't come up with her voice.
1773440	1774440	What should I do for her?
1774440	1775440	What should I do for her?
1775440	1780760	I'm the judge and you're going to listen to my justice.
1780760	1782760	Is that what you want?
1782760	1783760	No.
1783760	1789280	When you say judge, also based on our new artwork, I think of like a powdered wig judge,
1789280	1790280	so British.
1790280	1791280	I'm the judge.
1791280	1794600	Wait, is she wearing a powdered wig?
1794600	1795600	Powdered wig.
1795600	1796600	Oh yeah.
1796600	1797600	Powdered wig.
1797600	1798600	Lightning blue.
1798600	1799600	Black gloves.
1799600	1800600	Powdered merkins.
1800600	1801600	And blue high heels.
1801600	1802600	Electric blue high heels.
1802600	1803600	So yeah, British.
1803600	1804600	Joe?
1804600	1805600	Yeah, British.
1805600	1806600	Oh, okay.
1806600	1809040	I was going to kind of combine all three of them, but yeah.
1809040	1810040	Okay.
1810040	1813040	Then I would say aristocrat, not cockney.
1813040	1814040	Oh, Kai.
1814040	1815040	God dammit.
1815040	1828880	Due to all the outstanding evidence levied against these four, I do hereby charge Carol
1828880	1846240	Colorado, Julius Summers, Vic Wilder, and Stevie to be stoned to death.
1846240	1847240	Hell yeah.
1847240	1848240	Hell yeah.
1848240	1849240	Hell yeah.
1849240	1850240	But also-
1850240	1851240	No.
1851240	1854320	It's all Julius can summer out of.
1854320	1859180	You were probably the most effective person to speak up at that moment.
1859180	1865740	Blood splatters up above you, spraying back down directly in your eyes as you blind yourself
1865740	1871920	with your own blood spittling out of the hole in your mouth where most of your teeth used
1871920	1873420	to be.
1873420	1877680	The trial will commence in one hour.
1877680	1879360	Didn't you just sentence us?
1879360	1882400	To death for the trial.
1882400	1886320	So if we lose the trial, we'll die, but we could win.
1886320	1888720	Usually it's a trial, then sentencing.
1888720	1893720	I sentence you to a trial by stoning.
1893720	1894720	Yeah.
1894720	1895720	It's old school.
1895720	1896720	Trial by stone.
1896720	1901720	If you live, you are innocent.
1901720	1904680	Wait, what?
1904680	1905800	I charged you.
1905800	1908780	I literally already just charged you for the crime, didn't I?
1908780	1910640	But that's the thing that happens in the trial.
1910640	1911640	You get charged.
1911880	1916440	And then you go to trial, but you sentenced us to death, which is what happens typically
1916440	1917440	after a trial.
1917440	1918440	Damn.
1918440	1920240	But they do different things here in Grover's Court.
1920240	1921240	Yeah.
1921240	1922240	They tell you how you're going to die.
1922240	1926900	The justice system would probably be a lot more effective if we just started with a foregone
1926900	1935280	conclusion and worked our way towards that instead of-
1935280	1942360	I sentence you to be tried for the death of Sandro the Turtle, our dear mayor here
1942360	1944360	at Grover's Gorge.
1944360	1946320	Oh, that makes more sense.
1946320	1949500	The trial will commence in one hour.
1949500	1951960	You may roam free until then.
1951960	1952960	She looks at Vernon.
1952960	1953960	That's nice.
1953960	1954960	Yeah.
1954960	1955960	Oh, wait.
1955960	1956960	Oh, no, that's not right.
1956960	1962720	Vernon's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no take backs.
1962720	1963720	No take backs.
1964160	1965840	You all heard her say it, right?
1965840	1966840	Everybody.
1966840	1967840	Yes.
1967840	1968840	Everyone witnessed it?
1968840	1971840	Julius gives a thumbs up.
1971840	1976360	Your honor, might I request the defendant, Julius Summers, be allowed to receive medical
1976360	1977360	attention immediately?
1977360	1979920	He's in no fit shape to stand trial.
1979920	1981480	Medical attention will be given.
1981480	1982480	Thank you, your honor.
1982480	1985000	Julius gives a rock horns.
1985000	1989320	Because his other fingers are battered and broken.
1989320	1992840	He's trying to hold his hand up.
1993440	1995880	Well, I guess I don't know.
1995880	1999960	Should they be led free until the trial or should they be thrown in?
1999960	2002960	I think they should go free.
2002960	2006960	Yeah, let them go.
2006960	2010200	Seems like a vocal swelling of support for our freedom.
2010200	2016240	It would reflect very well on you and your community if you showed this kindness to us
2016240	2018320	before justice is properly expected.
2018320	2025560	I will grant you each 30 seconds to plead your case and then the crowd will vote.
2025560	2029600	Is this the trial or are we pleading to get like their freedom now?
2029600	2030600	Is that the 30 seconds?
2030600	2034960	No, this is just for pretrial bail, essentially.
2034960	2035960	Quick question.
2035960	2038680	Do you have your camera with the on you still?
2038680	2039680	Uh huh.
2039680	2040680	Yeah.
2040680	2041680	I think so.
2041680	2042680	Yeah, I think so.
2042680	2046080	Yeah, we tried lying and saying that we were live streaming, but they called our bluff.
2046120	2049960	I was probably filming that crowd before this all happened.
2049960	2051720	I think you can still be filming, honestly.
2051720	2055760	I just assume that Beck is literally like attached eye to camera.
2055760	2056760	Agreed.
2056760	2060560	I will grant you each 30 seconds to plead your case.
2060560	2067240	Your Honor, petition to have Julius' 30 seconds either split between Beckworth and I or he
2067240	2072680	seeks medical attention first before he's in no condition to plead any kind of case.
2072680	2075840	Julius barely is able to give a thumbs up.
2075840	2077520	He may go last.
2077520	2087440	And she looks over to the medical staff who are the two who were
2087440	2094160	like threatened by Julia Summers earlier and they are both giving the flat hand under their
2094160	2098480	chin waving side to side of like, no thank you, not us.
2098480	2105000	But they get on their little speaker system and call out and shortly medical staff will
2105000	2106000	be here to assist.
2106000	2107000	Hell yeah.
2107000	2115000	You may begin in three, two, one, go.
2115000	2123080	Well, a society that treats its imprisoned with respect is one that deserves respect.
2123080	2127960	We live in a country, this is I still believe, I hope, I sincerely hope we're still in the
2127960	2133960	United States, but we believe that a person here is innocent until proven guilty and I
2133960	2148840	believe that we should be given time to like be not guilty for a while.
2148840	2149840	You know?
2149840	2151800	Cal knots vigorously.
2151800	2155280	And more words, 30.
2155280	2157560	Please.
2157560	2160720	I bequeath my time.
2160720	2163080	Yeah.
2163080	2168340	And also like neither one of these big statue guys are even here.
2168340	2174960	So like how do you even know what you're supposed to be doing until one of them is here to like
2174960	2175960	tell you what to do.
2175960	2181000	Aren't they in charge, especially with your mayor being dead as well.
2181000	2185160	There's probably like no one in charge anymore time.
2185160	2191520	And lastly, and at this point, Julius has been fully like, actually go ahead and roll
2191520	2192520	a D4.
2192520	2195600	I said fully like a fool.
2195600	2201480	Well, you get one hit point back, which brings you up to what?
2201480	2202480	Two.
2202480	2206040	Well, two is enough to talk.
2206040	2210020	My mouth is mostly what's been fixed.
2210020	2212800	They focus on the face.
2212800	2216720	I believe that I've received punishment enough already.
2216720	2222220	I mean, up until you decide whether I'm guilty or not of the crime.
2222220	2231480	But I would like to have time to formulate my trial argument and I won't be running away
2231480	2235000	or anything because I know what happens to bad time.
2235000	2236560	All right.
2236560	2239880	I need all four people.
2239880	2247760	So the three of you and me is Stevie to roll persuade.
2247760	2250840	I passed a 19 on a 50.
2250840	2255320	I failed an 86 on a 60.
2255320	2258940	I pass a 43 on a 80.
2258940	2261280	And Stevie failed.
2261280	2264360	So go ahead and add up your two successes.
2264360	2265360	What were your successes?
2265360	2266360	43.
2266360	2267600	Mine was a 19.
2267600	2272960	Math 62.
2272960	2276440	He's just rolling until he gets more than 62.
2276440	2278680	41 plus 19 is 60.
2278680	2284160	I have one more role.
2284160	2285240	That's a success.
2285240	2297160	The crowd is seemingly on your side and vocalizations of like, Oh, maybe there's, okay, yes, now please
2297160	2298700	throw up some noise.
2298700	2314120	If you believe they should be let free between now and the trial, and now let's make some
2314120	2315800	noise.
2315800	2324520	If these four should be thrown in the pit, I don't think they should be in there.
2324520	2326240	No, this is not the right move.
2326240	2329040	I think we should consider a more reasoned approach.
2329040	2333440	Beck is literally shushing people near him.
2333440	2342760	Vernon pulls out these crazy looking handcuffs from behind his back and begins walking up
2342760	2347420	behind and slaps a pair on Stevie.
2347420	2351560	Can I roll another health now that they've applied it to more than my face?
2351560	2355600	I think as soon as they got you up and ready to go, like able to talk.
2355600	2356600	They left.
2356600	2357600	Yeah.
2357600	2358600	These are the guys who didn't want anything to do with you.
2358600	2362940	So they just put some chapstick on you and then, yeah, I'm just kind of like, I'm sitting
2362940	2363940	up now.
2363940	2370420	I'm not just completely on my back, but I just let him not struggling snaps a couple.
2370420	2376100	These are the same kind of like that fifties futuristic vibe of what people thought handcuffs
2376100	2377220	would look like.
2377220	2378220	Like laser beams?
2378220	2379220	Yeah.
2379220	2380220	Like an energy beam.
2380220	2381220	Yeah.
2381220	2387060	But it's like energy beam cuff, but there's very clearly like tubing around where the
2387060	2389500	cool pulsating light is coming from.
2389500	2390500	It's like fiber optic.
2390500	2391500	Yeah.
2391500	2392500	It's fiber optic.
2392500	2397140	Cal's like, that's a little disappointing.
2397140	2399900	It's a pair on Beck Wilder.
2399900	2402460	Dude, bro, this seems like totally unnecessary.
2402460	2403740	It's just a turtle guys.
2403740	2404740	Come on.
2404740	2406980	Puts your camera nicely back in its bag.
2406980	2410340	Vernon Covington is weirdly nice.
2410340	2412820	Like handles your camera with care.
2412820	2415220	Hey man, watch the merchandise dude.
2415220	2417420	Smiles up at you as he walks over to Cal.
2417420	2421860	Do you think he's a home videographer?
2421860	2422860	An enthusiast.
2422860	2426380	He didn't know how to put it in its bag, which is kind of tricky sometimes.
2426380	2429220	Hands behind your back.
2429220	2432860	Beck, are you filming?
2432860	2433860	It's in the bag.
2433860	2434860	Oh, right.
2434860	2435860	Okay.
2435860	2443900	As soon as he snaps your handcuffs on, he clicks a button and all four of your handcuffs
2443900	2451540	like snap together in a line where like a rod like reaches out and connects the four
2451540	2457580	of you together with a leash almost on the front end of it that he grabs hold of.
2457580	2461620	So it's like we're attached to an invisible foosball table arm.
2461620	2462620	Yeah.
2462620	2464020	That's what I was picturing.
2464020	2465020	Yeah.
2465020	2466020	With a leash.
2466020	2467020	Yeah.
2467020	2473260	And he begins leading you East away from this large lab that is made of glass and grass
2473260	2479660	and toward what was described to you as the factory where the GEs work.
2479660	2484140	The whole time, Cal was like, you know, some of those no votes seem to be from people sitting
2484140	2488460	in a natural hollow of sorts, which amplified their, I don't think this was an accurate
2488460	2492780	method of counting that vote.
2492780	2499540	Vernon Covington laughs and laughs and spits on the ground and continues walking you toward
2499540	2503700	this massive, massive building off in the distance.
2503700	2507380	Your laughter is a very cold thing, sir.
2507380	2512260	Vernon Covington laughs and spits on the ground.
2512260	2513820	Somebody like called you like the landlord.
2513820	2515820	You like own this place?
2515820	2526340	Well, you know, I am the overseer of sorts of the GIZs around here.
2526340	2529060	So you're more like a super or facilities.
2529060	2531140	I'm a super landlord.
2531140	2532140	Maintenance.
2532140	2533140	Hmm.
2533140	2534780	The name is what you make of it.
2534780	2542900	I do suppose a glorified errand boy carrying out whose orders look up behind you toward
2542900	2547900	the sky, your towering statues, but I understand they're not here right now.
2547900	2550500	Would they be happy with this decision you've made?
2550500	2560300	We'll see, yes, we'll see, oh, we'll see when you go in the it pit.
2560300	2568020	We'll see if Fred Godel likes it when I have you down in the it pit.
2568020	2572420	Julius, I know you're hurt, but remember that name for a future segment.
2572420	2573420	Which name?
2573420	2574420	The it pit.
2574420	2579620	Oh, nods his head and, guys, I think my wisdom teeth grew back.
2579620	2585340	Yeah, man, that machine works wonders, dude.
2585340	2591380	Julius is kind of still out of it, like coming back to life, but he will remember the it
2591380	2593300	pit.
2593300	2598860	As you guys make it towards this factory, you see plenty of happy and chipper ease wearing
2598860	2605340	their work clothes, cute little jumpsuits that are both monochromatic and have little
2605340	2608860	flashes of yellow all over them, heading in and out of work.
2608860	2615180	But you guys do not take the front entrance as you lead you around the back.
2615180	2620740	As you walk around the back, this is the first time you've really made it toward the trees.
2620740	2627780	These trees are all around, and there's just this thick, hazy fog off in the distance that
2627780	2632020	you can kind of make out through the thick of the trees in the distance.
2632020	2639540	He leads you around the corner of this massive facility and in the ground around back behind
2639540	2641060	the factory.
2641060	2648220	There are two metal doors that seem like they go down into a bomb shelter or a bunker of
2648220	2649220	some sorts.
2649220	2650220	Or like a pit.
2650220	2651220	They're in the ground.
2651220	2652220	They're in the ground.
2652220	2653220	Like a hatch.
2653220	2654220	Much like a hatch.
2654220	2657780	A hatch that's actually in the ground.
2657780	2659180	Not a SpongeBob door.
2659180	2664260	This one does not have the cool wheel on it that makes a fun noise when it turns.
2664260	2665260	I know.
2665460	2670260	But you're just like, around back there's two doors, and then...
2670260	2671260	Just I don't know.
2671260	2677660	It seems like you have trouble with openings as a spatial concept.
2677660	2680500	Which reminds me of another Stephen King book I read.
2680500	2682740	Oh my god.
2682740	2694700	He opens up one of the metal doors, opens up the other one, inside is only darkness,
2694700	2705780	and out comes the most foul stench, decrepit, awful, human anatomy that's just been left
2705780	2714220	out in blood that's coagulated and piss and shit and cum that's just molded over growing
2714220	2715820	cultures on them.
2715820	2719020	Who could cum in a place like this?
2719020	2722020	And we'll answer that question on the next episode.
2722020	2723020	No, it's not over yet.
2723020	2727740	Yeah, we still need a closing line.
2727740	2729220	This pit is not it.
2729220	2737180	It kind of smells like Beck's bedroom.
2737180	2741780	He takes his cane and hits Stevie in the back of one of her legs and then pushes her into
2741780	2742780	the pit.
2742780	2743780	Hey, whoa, bro!
2743780	2744780	Boom!
2744780	2748060	Immediately, the three of you just dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
2748060	2752820	And if anyone can hold on, you can give it a go here, but you're being whipped down
2752820	2755500	and dragged by the human weight.
2755500	2762420	Kind of like we're spinning like you would spin a bunch of foosball players.
2762420	2766980	We might have some leverage here, literally, because he knocked the smallest person down
2766980	2767980	the stairs, presumably.
2767980	2774300	There are no stairs as you look down and you just hear Stevie yelling out like, oh, ow,
2774300	2780060	ow, ow, ow, and like she's screaming out because her hands were behind her, so when she went
2780060	2784860	down, her hands are now above her head if you were looking down in her eye.
2784860	2786500	It's a dislocated shoulder action.
2786500	2792500	Yeah, Julius is the next one up, so Julius is staring down and you're seeing, I mean,
2792500	2798860	her arms just snapped up fully behind to then be above her, and she's just like, oh, oh,
2798860	2802380	shit, oh, just, oh, shit, oh.
2802380	2807860	We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode because I'm sitting here and
2807860	2812820	I'm like, I don't like being here.
2812820	2816780	Julius looks at- Content warning, not fun.
2816780	2818540	This one, not so fun.
2818540	2819980	Not fun, man.
2819980	2824540	Julius looks at the other two guys and just goes, I think we should jump.
2824540	2825540	Do we have a choice?
2825540	2826540	I'm confused now.
2826540	2828780	Yeah, how far- Did we all go tumbling in now because of her?
2828780	2833220	I think, like Thomas pointed out, he did push in the smallest one, so-
2833220	2834820	Oh, so she's just like dangling by her arm.
2834820	2835820	She's just dangling by her arm.
2835820	2836820	That's okay.
2836820	2837820	Why didn't I say nothing?
2837820	2838820	Sorry, Stevie.
2838820	2840460	Yeah, that's what made that happen.
2840460	2844620	I thought that she had hit with such a weird impact that it had snapped her arms up.
2844620	2849220	She's like dangling there while we're not- He's got his cane out, he's looking at Julius
2849220	2854580	and he's just like, jump, and he lifts his cane up and they're like, he's about to hit
2854580	2855580	you.
2855580	2858900	Julius immediately gets a cane PTSD and he says, I think we should jump, and then he
2858900	2859900	jumps.
2859900	2860900	Nope.
2860900	2861900	Boom.
2861900	2863540	We got two and- Okay, I try to grab out.
2863540	2866700	Oh, wait, I've handcuffed- Yeah, you have handcuffs on and Beck is
2866700	2870780	actually next up and the two of you are the only ones standing, so I'm actually going
2870780	2877900	to need strength rolls here in order for the two of you to stay up.
2877900	2883540	And Vernon Covington is laughing his ass off while this happens.
2883540	2885740	Cal passes a 45 on a 50.
2885740	2888020	I failed a 57 on a 55.
2888020	2894580	Okay, a 45 is enough to where when Beck falls in, you skirt your heels right up to the edge
2894580	2901180	and are able to just hold on, but as you do so, Beck's arms are about to do the exact
2901180	2903780	same thing if you don't jump at this last second.
2903780	2909340	I know my hands are down behind my back, but Cal just wants to try to throw himself back
2909340	2915220	and grab out with his fingers for any part of Vernon's clothes and take him down with
2915220	2916220	us.
2916220	2917220	Awesome.
2917220	2918220	Fucking cool.
2918220	2919220	That's so cool.
2919220	2922860	What would that be?
2922860	2923860	Grabby grabbies.
2923860	2927380	Oh yeah, I've got a hundred in grabby grabbies.
2927380	2931460	Well, his hands are sticky from the poison ivy, so.
2931460	2934540	Right, all the pus from the poison ivy that's still here.
2934540	2935540	We actually did say that.
2935540	2936540	That's why we cured it, I forgot.
2936540	2937540	Yeah, I know.
2937540	2938540	I know.
2938540	2939540	I'm talking.
2939540	2940540	Ooh, I'm talking.
2940540	2941540	That's what I'm...
2941540	2942540	I'm talking.
2942540	2943540	Shut up.
2943540	2944540	I'm talking here.
2944540	2945540	No.
2945540	2949380	No, you said what I said before I said it.
2949380	2950380	The bear.
2950380	2951380	That's pretty good.
2951380	2952820	So yeah, what should I roll here?
2953260	2956340	You should roll athletics or decks.
2956340	2959140	Okay, I'm going to roll dexterity.
2959140	2960140	Yep.
2960140	2964020	Got a 45 in that.
2964020	2965580	And I rolled a 70.
2965580	2966580	So I'm going to spend my luck.
2966580	2968860	Wait, yeah, to change that to a seven.
2968860	2969860	Right.
2969860	2970860	Which is great because he crit fails.
2970860	2971860	Oh, fuck yes.
2971860	2972860	Holy shit.
2972860	2978860	All right, because he crit fails, I'm going to say Beck keeps his arms, which is very
2978860	2979980	nice for Beck.
2979980	2980980	You're able to grab him.
2980980	2982580	They were going to be ripped out of their sockets?
2982580	2983580	Yeah, they were.
2983580	2984580	Did mine?
2984580	2985580	Did mine already do that?
2985580	2986580	Actually, fuck.
2986580	2987580	Ouchie.
2987580	2994620	I would say it's not a foregone conclusion that your arms would dislocate in this position.
2994620	2996820	Yeah, you could come up.
2996820	3000460	Well, when he put the cuffs on me, they were in front of me.
3000460	3001460	Oh, nice.
3001460	3002460	That was nice.
3002460	3003460	That worked out well for you.
3003460	3004460	Yeah.
3004460	3007580	Because I was like, my arms hurt too bad to put them on the way back there.
3007580	3011420	So you just have your arms raised normally above your head.
3011420	3013140	It's uncomfortable, but it's not terrible.
3013140	3017660	Yeah, you were able to hold on to the in-between connection.
3017660	3023180	So yeah, as Kal is slipping off, he just manages to get three little fingers around
3023180	3024180	a belt.
3024180	3025180	Inside the vest.
3025180	3026180	Yeah.
3026180	3027180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3027180	3028180	And he just yanks him off with us.
3028180	3029180	Boom.
3029180	3030180	And with the belt in your hands.
3030180	3031180	I jack him off into the gumpit.
3031180	3032180	Okay.
3032180	3033460	Oh, fuck, dude.
3033460	3038340	He can't get both doors, but also because he crit fails there, he's trying to grab on
3038340	3042340	to one of the doors for any sort of like leverage on the ground, right?
3042340	3044780	But that just ends up shutting one of them.
3044780	3049060	And slamming his fingers and breaking his hands, right?
3049060	3050060	Why not?
3050060	3051060	Yeah.
3051060	3052060	Hands.
3052060	3053060	Fingers, maybe.
3053060	3054060	Knees and toes.
3054060	3059580	As he comes down, he's got his fingers just on the edge, but then that door that he pulled
3059580	3064940	up just comes down and slices off all of his fingertips.
3064940	3066100	Slices them off?
3066100	3067100	Yeah.
3067100	3075580	And as you guys all hit the ground, he's just, whoa, oh my, oh shit, oh my goodness, oh no,
3075580	3076780	oh my God.
3076780	3080480	And you look over and there's just very little light in here.
3080480	3085020	The only light that is actually coming through is coming in through one of the empty doors
3085020	3086020	that is above you.
3086020	3087460	So light is pouring in through that.
3087460	3094360	And you see that Vernon Covington shoves his fingers into what is the ground, but what
3094360	3102320	is essentially just a layer of, okay, so like the amount of skin that sloughs off of
3102320	3111680	a human in like a certain amount of time, like leaves a certain amount of skin waste.
3111680	3112680	Mostly what dust is.
3112680	3113680	Most of the dust in your house.
3113680	3114680	Yeah.
3114680	3118840	This place be dusty and the dust is basically turned to mud.
3118840	3119840	Yeah.
3119840	3120840	Because of all the shit and blood and common piss.
3120840	3122840	Because of all the shit and blood and common piss.
3122840	3123840	Yeah.
3124320	3125320	You've got a pretty good idea of what that sounds like in here.
3125320	3126320	Oh, did we say puss?
3126320	3128320	Oh, and it'd be a lot of that too.
3128320	3129320	Snot.
3129320	3130320	There would absolutely be a fair amount of snot and puss.
3130320	3131320	That's just some puss.
3131320	3132320	Kind of puss really.
3132320	3133320	It's all white blood cells.
3133320	3134320	Interesting.
3134320	3135320	Yeah.
3135320	3137320	And probably a bunch of skin cells in there too.
3137320	3138320	Yeah.
3138320	3139320	Yeah.
3139320	3140320	So we got it double covered.
3140320	3143320	I'm going to go ahead and say roll grip.
3143320	3144320	Okay.
3144320	3156480	I wanted to pass this so bad because that could be okay with a certain degree of this.
3156480	3157480	But I did not.
3157480	3159360	I'm an 83 on a 63.
3159360	3164040	Cal, Colorado is not okay with this at all and critically fails.
3164040	3166680	77 on a 56.
3166680	3169580	I got a 41 on a 45.
3169580	3172780	Congratulations Julia Summers.
3172780	3173780	He's in too much pain.
3173780	3177260	And like half blind and can't really tell what's going on.
3177260	3184300	Literally the thoughts on my mind are who came down here with us and my wisdom teeth
3184300	3188940	hurts so bad right now.
3188940	3197740	You lose one grip, Beck, you failed, which means you lose one D4 plus one and Cal, because
3197740	3203540	you critically failed, you lose the most for this role, which is five.
3204020	3208780	I got the most and it looks like Joe, I got the most too.
3208780	3217700	And I got a chance to not have the most and I got the most.
3217700	3218700	That's a big old fiver.
3218700	3223260	Hey, Zach, that also makes me hit my bow breaking point.
3223260	3225020	I'm one away from my breaking point.
3225020	3228180	Oh, why did I tell that's for the audience, Zach.
3228180	3229180	Don't listen to that.
3229180	3231600	I don't get any ideas, mister.
3231600	3235200	So we're going to have the cover Joe's breaking point here, and we're also going to have to
3235200	3238840	take care of fight flight or freeze.
3238840	3240280	Okay.
3240280	3243080	So that's a three, two, one, right?
3243080	3247040	So three fight, two freeze, one flee.
3247040	3248040	Okay.
3248040	3249420	Do I do that because of the breaking point?
3249420	3252280	You do that because you lost five as well.
3252280	3258160	Losing five grip in one go means you got to roll that fight flight freeze.
3258160	3263600	It is going to be Beck's first because you don't want to be in this pit.
3263600	3265720	Freeze would be a second and third is fight.
3265720	3266720	Yep.
3266720	3267720	Beck got a two, which was freeze.
3267720	3268720	Your name's Cal.
3268720	3271440	Oh, Cal got a two.
3271440	3279880	That's not going to stop the shippers or just one now call me by your name.
3279880	3282680	Let me eat your arm.
3282680	3284360	So you are doing what now?
3284360	3285360	You're freezing.
3285360	3286360	Yeah.
3286360	3290480	Cal feels a brief moment of triumph as he drags the landlord down with them.
3290480	3295900	But then as soon as he sees what's in this pit, instead of trying to beat him to death,
3295900	3301840	he just looks around every part of his face drops and he just stands there silently crying.
3301840	3307040	And I think that in this moment, as you're standing there crying, it's one of those you're
3307040	3312880	in here with me, I'm not in here with you situations as you realize that you have brought
3312880	3320480	down a person who has been capable of extreme violence, whose hands are not cuffed.
3320480	3323320	Yeah, but his fucking fingers are cut off.
3323320	3324320	Yeah.
3324320	3331160	It's not going to help as I try to beat the shit out of you guys until you die.
3331160	3332560	Weird call, but I like it.
3332560	3333560	Beck Wilder.
3333560	3339000	I mean, you're going to have to tell me how much you allow in the handcuffs, but Beck
3339000	3340000	rolled a one.
3340000	3342280	Oh, that's the fucking-
3343120	3346040	Joe business right there.
3346040	3349680	He's going to try and start kicking and headbutting Vernon.
3349680	3354320	He is far too concerned with his current situation right now to fight back.
3354320	3360520	So you've got a free shot on him and because you're going with just like unbridled lack
3360520	3366080	of grip on reality here, you are going to act in basically what is a surprise round
3366080	3369640	before we get into combat.
3369640	3370640	Especially no one.
3370640	3378080	Beck is not a combat person, so I can roll unarmed combat, which you get a natural 40%
3378080	3379080	in.
3379080	3380080	That's not a bad score.
3380080	3385200	I would argue that I'm literally not using my arms, so maybe it's just like strength.
3385200	3386200	Leg combat?
3386200	3389040	No, I'm going to call that unarmed combat.
3389040	3390040	Yeah.
3390040	3391040	If you're not using your arms, man.
3391040	3394040	It's super unarmed.
3394040	3396480	Head and leg only.
3396480	3399080	I could see like pure violence also being a strength roll.
3399080	3400080	I passed it.
3400080	3401080	It's a 12.
3401080	3402080	Oh, that's great.
3402080	3403080	It's uncontested.
3403080	3408400	Can I headbutt him unconscious?
3408400	3412000	You can give him one great headbutt hopefully here.
3412000	3416760	Go ahead and roll a- what is a headbutt worth?
3416760	3421120	Oh, that's a D100.
3421120	3422320	You haven't seen Beck's head.
3422320	3424520	It's going to be a D4 minus one.
3424520	3426640	Just give us a D4.
3426640	3427640	Nice.
3427640	3428640	So three total.
3429200	3437000	So Vernon Covington takes three damage as you- I mean through the slop in the mud beneath
3437000	3438000	your feet.
3438000	3442720	Do you want to describe how Beck headbutts Vernon Covington?
3442720	3446560	I mean, since his hands are behind his back and he's attached to all these guys, it's
3446560	3449320	going to be a weird kind of lunge forward.
3449320	3454120	He might even lose his feet for a second to get enough momentum to bring everybody forward
3454120	3455120	with him.
3455120	3458480	And he just kind of supermances his head into Vernon's head.
3458480	3462720	And since he connects, I think that he can stay on his feet because of that.
3462720	3465640	If he had missed, he would have gone face down past him.
3465640	3468520	Vernon just failed to stay standing.
3468520	3473080	He is on his back prone and will now act last in this turn.
3473080	3474480	What is your guys' dexterity?
3474480	3475480	45.
3475480	3476480	75.
3476480	3477480	Mine's a 50.
3477680	3485960	So first up, Stevie fucking just starts stomping on Vernon Covington's face and it's Julius
3485960	3487020	Summers' turn.
3487020	3491440	I want to point out real fast- That's what I wanted to do if I wasn't present.
3491440	3494760	Just for the record, there's no way that Beck can say this in person, but I'll say it out
3494760	3496680	of character because I want us all to be aware.
3496680	3500960	There's no reason- like now we're definitely going to be sentenced to death if we get out
3500960	3501960	of here.
3501960	3508600	This is us killing or naming the landlord.
3508600	3510160	He brought us here on his own.
3510160	3511720	It's our word against his.
3511720	3515760	He brought us to their fucking weird cum shit torture pit.
3515760	3524120	Oh, you know, he tried to hit us and fuck us with a dead guy's arm or whatever.
3524120	3527600	So yeah, it was self-defense and we ended up beating him to death.
3527600	3530320	Sorry, but maybe you should have a real police force here.
3530320	3531320	I don't know.
3532720	3534040	It's better to ask for forgiveness.
3534040	3538560	I'm glad you said it, but like Julius does not think of that at all.
3538560	3539560	Thank you.
3539560	3546640	But now it's like everything I do, I'm like, damn, it's stupid to do this.
3546640	3554440	As your turn turns the corner here, you see that Stevie is performing an act that is making
3554440	3559840	Vernon Covington look in role-playing parlance bloodied.
3559840	3567120	Julius is going to, for lack of a better term, I'm going to straddle his head and try to
3567120	3569400	just crush his head between my legs.
3569400	3574720	Foreshadowing the triumphant end of the campaign when he defeats the watermelon people.
3574720	3579160	Now see, this is a strength roll.
3586160	3588160	28 on 50.
3588160	3589160	Holy shit.
3589480	3590480	Okay.
3590480	3595800	So because what you're going for here is full-blown like head smash.
3595800	3598600	Like skull fracturing head smash.
3598600	3599600	Yeah.
3599600	3602160	I'm going to have him roll constitution.
3602160	3606600	So you are going to do one D4 minus one damage.
3606600	3607600	One.
3607600	3608600	Okay.
3608600	3609760	So you do one damage to him.
3609760	3616440	You are squeezing his head so hard that his actually, his a tipless fingers are now like
3616440	3617960	reaching out for you.
3617960	3626480	But every single time that he actually tries to grab onto you, he's cause it hurts so fucking
3626480	3628560	bad when he's trying to reach out.
3628560	3629560	Well good.
3629560	3633920	Cal, Colorado, you are frozen.
3633920	3638440	What is going through your brain is you're unable to act in this turn.
3638440	3644080	I guess Cal is kind of being dragged around by everybody on this line, but he's not really
3644080	3645640	seeing what's in front of his face.
3645640	3650120	He's just remembering conversations with like his ex wife where she's like, one day this
3650120	3652120	job is going to get you killed.
3652120	3656280	Like one day you're going to be in a situation where you couldn't say no and you're going
3656280	3657600	to pay the price.
3657600	3659120	There's more important things, Cal.
3659120	3662080	There's more fucking important things than that job.
3662080	3669560	And he's not quite like ready to accept that, but that's all he's seen in his mind at the
3669560	3671600	top of the next round.
3671600	3679840	Vernon reaches out his fingerprintless fingers, trying to grasp and find his cane and he successfully
3679840	3681160	does so.
3681160	3688600	And when he goes to use it on Julius Summers, wrapped so tightly around his face, he is
3688600	3694000	fully unable to quite figure out where Julius is still.
3694000	3698280	He's just whipping his arm around randomly and confusedly.
3698280	3699800	He's freaking out.
3699800	3704960	The guy can't even fucking breathe right now and he's losing his absolute shit.
3704960	3711760	I don't think you're going to be able to hit me with your cane.
3711760	3712760	Got him.
3712760	3713760	Bible stuff.
3713760	3714760	Bible slam.
3714760	3715760	Yeah.
3715760	3716760	Total Bible slam.
3716760	3717760	Fucking got him.
3717760	3721800	Interesting character choice at this time to make Julius religious.
3721800	3723480	He's losing it a little bit.
3723480	3725720	Julius is deeply Christian.
3725720	3730240	Stevie straight up, she was stomping on the face, but the face is taken.
3730240	3737600	So she jumps into the air with both feet coming right down on Vernon Covington's ribs and
3737600	3740840	you hear just crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.
3740840	3741840	Holy shit.
3741840	3742840	And he just...
3742840	3743840	Spatchcock.
3743840	3744840	Julius Summers.
3744840	3745840	Finish him.
3745840	3746840	Finish him.
3746840	3747840	Finish him.
3747840	3748840	Finish him.
3748840	3749840	Finish him.
3749840	3750840	Finish him.
3750840	3751840	Finish him.
3751840	3752840	Finish him.
3752840	3753840	Finish him.
3753840	3754840	Finish him.
3754960	3755960	Finish him.
3755960	3756960	Finish him.
3756960	3762400	Julius avoids the cane and kind of like kicks his foot trying to knock it out of his hand,
3762400	3766080	repositions and then just full force squeeze again.
3766080	3767080	Oh, give me that.
3767080	3769360	Give me that strength.
3769360	3771200	That'll be a three minus one, two.
3771200	3773200	Oh, wait, I got to do strength check.
3773200	3774200	Strength check.
3774200	3775200	Yeah.
3775200	3776200	45 on a 50.
3776200	3779240	I succeeded as well, but only with a 10.
3779240	3780240	Nice.
3780240	3781240	And you rolled?
3781240	3782680	I rolled a three minus one.
3782680	3785200	Plus one, which is two.
3785200	3790560	He's going to roll a constitution to stay conscious and he fails.
3790560	3799320	The muffled screams of Vernon Covington, the landlord, begin to slowly fade into the enormous
3799320	3803920	thighs of Julius Summers.
3803920	3806680	Do you stay on top of him?
3806680	3811480	Julius doesn't stop squeezing until he, his eyes are finally adjusting to the dim light
3811480	3818480	in here and he's going to wait until he sees eyeballs pop out.
3818480	3820040	Just continuously squeezing.
3820040	3821600	I can't see his eyes.
3821600	3822600	His eyes are in your teeth.
3822600	3825880	And just medically that might not be what happens.
3825880	3830080	I know, but it's not a, this isn't a medical podcast.
3830080	3834920	Actually, this is, this is a spinoff of Sawbones.
3834920	3840720	Uh, yeah, Julius is just going to keep doing it until basically until somebody pulls him
3841240	3843080	Just continuously squeezing.
3843080	3844080	Julius stop.
3844080	3847080	We're out of combat now, right?
3847080	3848080	Yeah.
3848080	3850960	Julius, Julius, he's worth more to us dead.
3850960	3859840	I mean, he's worth moral to the world dead, but to us right now he's worth more alive.
3859840	3861520	He's our only bargaining chip.
3861520	3868080	Julius gives like one last little squeeze and then stands up and just spits on his face.
3868080	3874440	Even the force of your spit hitting the back of his head makes his eyeballs explode.
3874440	3876000	That's how science works.
3876000	3882280	He spits on his face that kind of looks like a pug, like, you know, smashed with eyeballs
3882280	3885300	kind of smashed out.
3885300	3888080	You know how those ugly little pugs look?
3888080	3889080	Yeah.
3889080	3890080	You know, with their eyeballs.
3890080	3892080	With their eyeballs almost hanging out of their head.
3892080	3893080	Yeah.
3893080	3894080	Like that.
3894080	3895080	So he's cute.
3895080	3900160	We beat him into adorableness took a lot, took a lot.
3900160	3910160	And as your eyes adjust to this low lighting down here in the pit, you see that all over
3910160	3923080	every single wall are the same cryptic designs over and over and over seems to be drawn in
3924080	3929080	whatever it is that's below you making up the ground here, slathered on these walls.
3929080	3935640	And I'm going to, I'm going to send it in the group and let you guys describe it that
3935640	3936640	way.
3936640	3937640	I don't give anything away.
3937640	3938640	Okay.
3938640	3939640	Just send it.
3939640	3940640	Yeah.
3940640	3941640	It's it's his dick.
3941640	3944880	It's just kind of looks like a tongue.
3944880	3945880	How's my dog?
3945880	3946880	Yeah.
3946880	3947880	Uh, five.
3947880	3948880	Nice stars.
3949880	3954800	You got to take care of that tongue thing, man.
3954800	3955800	Okay.
3955800	3961760	So we've got like a big spiral and in the center of the spiral looks like what is like,
3961760	3968920	what's the castle thing called a rook from a chest like a rampart.
3968920	3973680	No, it's like a castle tower, the top of a tower of a castle.
3973680	3978480	Well, it's, it's like the teen Titans tower, but wearing a crown.
3978480	3979480	Yeah.
3979480	3982280	Or maybe you can't see its head and those are its shoulders and it's, it's bar mitzvah
3982280	3986600	and it's wearing that, that thing, that sash you wear anyway.
3986600	3987680	That's in the middle.
3987680	3994480	And then like coming out of the spiral from the middle is a star, a perfectly drawn, like
3994480	3997480	five point star, like a kid would draw.
3997480	4002720	And then going, I mean, I drew it, so fuck you.
4002760	4009600	Moving on the spiral line, the next thing you get is like, like basically a V, but in
4009600	4015600	the bottom of the V is a diamond or like the, uh, Mason's symbol.
4015600	4016600	It's a square.
4016600	4017600	Yeah.
4017600	4022920	Not like a square shape, like a, a, a, the square tool, I guess I'm looking at it.
4022920	4023920	Okay.
4023920	4024920	Yeah.
4024920	4030800	And then continuing on the spiral is, am I looking at it this way or this way?
4030800	4037680	It's like a lowercase teen Titans tower upside down.
4037680	4040400	Then there's like a wall with a gate, maybe some kind of doorway.
4040400	4044200	There's a line with what looks like a door in it maybe, but I think it's a wall with
4044200	4045200	a door.
4045200	4046200	It kind of looks like a field.
4046200	4047200	Yeah.
4047200	4048680	Like a, like an archway in a field.
4048680	4055360	Yeah, that could be, you know, the kid who drew this.
4055360	4058360	And then basically, uh, an upside down cross.
4058360	4060440	No, that's the lowercase teen Titans tower.
4061080	4062080	That's a hammer.
4062080	4063080	Oh, okay.
4063080	4064080	Yeah.
4064080	4065080	Yeah.
4065080	4069680	And we'll post this picture on Instagram at pretending pod on Twitter at pretending pod.
4069680	4070680	Zach, are you okay?
4070680	4072760	You actually drew this on your walls.
4072760	4073760	Yeah.
4073760	4076240	Uh, Thomas isn't making a joke.
4076240	4080400	The picture that he sent us is him standing next to a white wall that he has drawn this
4080400	4081400	on.
4081400	4082400	Yeah.
4082400	4083400	With my piss and shit and comments.
4083400	4084400	It is Brown.
4084400	4085400	A little blood.
4085400	4089280	It looks like it wouldn't be the whole stew with who took this picture.
4089280	4090280	Taylor.
4091120	4092120	No, I took that long arms.
4092120	4094120	Oh, whoa.
4094120	4100560	You must have, I'm sorry, but that's a selfie all day long, Betty.
4100560	4105320	It just looks like his shoulders are both like that shoulder does look like it's going
4105320	4106320	straight down.
4106320	4111560	It's, it's all elbow.
4111560	4115880	And to get enough of you and my forearms, three feet long.
4115880	4118720	So do we see one of those or a bunch of those?
4118720	4125560	You see those just all over, like spiral to spiral covering the entirety of the walls
4125560	4130840	and they all have these little designs drawn slightly differently, but in the exact same
4130840	4135880	spots over and over and over and over.
4135880	4137640	I are you okay?
4137640	4140640	Cause like this is not a compelling symbol.
4140640	4142760	This is actually what a crazy person would make.
4142760	4144760	Honestly, thank you so much.
4144800	4145800	Thank you so much.
4145800	4149800	That is exactly what I was going for.
4149800	4157800	Top to bottom nonsense with a very poor overall like sense of composition.
4174760	4200440	Whew.
4200440	4201600	I'm sweaty.
4201600	4203240	I am also very sweaty.
4203240	4204920	And I am pee.
4204920	4206920	I am pee.
