0.00 241.46 speaker0  What is up my babies, do y'all know what time it is? It's time for your ear holes to get filled up by y'alls truly, Wolf, the dog. And your ears are absorbing these sounds from Contentions greatest radio show, broadcasting from 694.2 PTBP. This week's Howlin' with Wolf was submitted by a listener who tagged that pretending pod in their Instagram story. What a fuckin' champ, spreading the good news like that. They write, Better buckle up baby, because your new favorite band, Buckle Up Baby, is dropping their first tape this Friday, March 8th. Don't sleep on this one, don't be late. If you like fun, then save the date. Suzy Trash, Casual Cal, and Contentions own, Kudzu. This Friday, March 8th at 1703, South Fremont in Springfield, Missouri. That place sounds made up, y'all. Check out the track and use the internet to learn more. Now time for the news. Listeners were treated to a blast from Clark Bishop's past. But it was less of a treat for Clark, who found himself locked in the public library with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely dark. The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit. That sadly was not the worst of it, my babies. Clark got back home only to find his reality shattering, eventually remembering the confession of the woman who killed his parents. Back in the real world, the officers went to the Daily Fur after Gary Daly called in to report information about the chief's disappearance. They learned the chief arrived to her home accompanied by James, who works at the mill, and another man who held them at gunpoint. The gunman was in all black and had a scar over his eye. Gary Daly saw this because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who took Drew to the chief's home. The officers, always utilizing their time mighty efficiently, spent a while asking Gary
236.62 275.24 speaker3  and our friend Justin is here with us today to play, who are you playing? I am playing one Don D. Pettymore. And who is that? Kind of uncle. I'm his dad's cousin, but I'm only like 13, 14 years older than him. Mm-hmm. Does it sound good? I need to look at the mic more. But you want to get real close? You got to stay just out.
272.86 285.24 speaker2  You're trying to tease the muppet. Just don't let the muppet get what it wants. Never let a muppet get what it wants. No.
284.24 288.20 speaker3  I think that's...
286.88 306.88 speaker2  I mean, crumbs are everywhere. It'll get everywhere.
302.80 315.32 speaker3  in the life of John Lee Pettymore.
313.46 495.34 speaker2  horrible accident. And John Lee Pettymore has prepared a little monologue. About his experience, yes. Hold on, let me... What propels a man? What propels a man to seek glory? What propels a man to test his mettle, to meld his talents with that of a machine and together seek victory? Speedway's main grandstand? I briefly had time to consider all this as I was thrown free of my sprint car and head first into the abundant lap of Mrs. Eldora Jane Duncans. To her great fortune, God saw fit to place a support girder in my trajectory, and that girder shattered my pelvis and snapped my right leg, sparing Mrs. Eldora the full force of my impact. Dear boy, Elvis Jr. was not as lucky. The flying buckle of my defective safety harness took his eye in an instant. God was all out of girders. What propels a man? I didn't figure that one out before I lost consciousness, but as I flew towards the grandstands I could see with perfect clarity who had propelled me there. Laura Jetty. Dickhead. Chucklefuck. Shitbird. King of the sprint racing circuit. She had cut across my line and forced me into a wall. The corners I had cut to get there in the first place did the rest. Ordering a race-used harness in fair condition from eBay wasn't the best idea, but I could only stretch Uncle Don's money so far. Turns out it stretched just as far as a young boy's eye, which was farther than my luck. Every scrap of it that had propelled me here had burnt out. Don D. Pettymore looked out at the world from dead eyes. Uncle Don came from the hard side of the family, the side that had starved before and vowed to never starve again, and now I owed him real money. Adora's screams grew more distant as I faded out of consciousness, and the last thing I I'm not really, uh... John Lee Pettymore, me, is not the creative writing type, so... But uh... My physical therapist, Jane, she really worked me through my shattered pelvis and leg, and she suggested that... Journaling? Well, yeah, I mean, in other words... Writing prose and whatnot? Well, yeah, she suggested that perhaps my mental spiritual self was also shattered like
492.34 506.34 speaker3  my pelvis, and that it might help to get some of that out. Dude, a haiku or two would heal you. Haiku?
504.34 534.34 speaker2  Haiku? Aldora Jane Duncans? Yeah, married to Elvis Duncans. How do you spell Duncans? Duncans like the donuts. And... Okay. If you're Duncan.
532.34 546.34 speaker3  And her son was in the race?
540.34 565.34 speaker2  And my safety buckle, which had separated, it was a defective piece of equipment that what happened there is that it flew into the young boy's eye and took it from him, as the Lord is wont to take many things from us in his mysterious and unknowable mycenations. Mycenations.
563.34 606.34 speaker3  Talking so goddamn hard, man. I hate talking. Don and John are sitting in the back of the ambulance from the Contention County Speedway, and the EMT who works there is checking out John, and actually she kind of walks up and Never going to race again. I don't see any way around it.
602.34 614.34 speaker2  like this, but how did you know that about me?
612.34 622.34 speaker3  around here at least, that's for sure. You're just, you're an EMT.
619.34 641.34 speaker2  Why are you, what a thing to tell a man in recovery.
637.34 673.34 speaker3  to take too kindly to their boy losing an eye. You know how, you know, Patriarch Duncan owns the Contention County Speedway as well as almost all the speedways in this region. So I think y'all might be done fucked.
672.34 677.34 speaker2  That my dream is over?
675.34 686.34 speaker3  Her name is Ernti. Ernti.
685.34 693.34 speaker0  Yes.
692.34 711.34 speaker3  He is my own flesh and blood. And I walk over to him and I grab his face and I look at him. You got to face reality, boy. No, Don.
708.34 722.34 speaker2  Why am I going to face it today, Don?
721.34 724.34 speaker3  It's okay, boy.
723.34 750.34 speaker2  I owe you so much money.
741.34 801.68 speaker3  And next we see Don pushing John in a wheelchair because you can't afford that ambulance ride. Not after you lost a lot of money in that crash just now. So you decide to drive and on your way, actually it's kind of weird. Don, you see these two figures. John, you don't see this because you're in a wheelchair. But Don, you see these two figures that are watching you from behind, kind of on the side of the track. And as you're walking out, they begin approaching you from the back. They are both extremely tall people with large frames, but they are very gaunt and they begin walking faster and faster toward you. And they are going to catch up with you if you don't begin to move a bit faster there. John, you ready to hustle, boy?
799.68 811.68 speaker2  I start shoveling on real quick.
810.18 857.68 speaker3  the wheelchair ahead of him. And these two figures are catching up. There's no one else around, weirdly enough. As soon as you see them, no one else seems to be on the track. And you see as they're approaching on you, Don, you're looking backward as you're running. And as you guys are running and running and running, one of them just starts screaming. As they're running toward you and then...
851.68 887.68 speaker2  Hey, hey, you fancy, you fancy men, you fucking stay away. Go on.
878.68 890.68 speaker3  but you do see your car, Don, that you both came in today.
887.68 893.68 speaker2  Hell yeah.
890.68 941.68 speaker3  Surrogate, son. And, actually, large Eddie. As you're looking into the parking lot, you would see that your car is currently being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit grew.
940.68 968.68 speaker2  God damn it, Eddie.
958.68 1002.68 speaker3  And he begins walking toward you guys as his crew continues to try to lift, but they're clearly having a harder time now that large Eddie isn't helping them. How large is he? He's like 6'5", which is not a- He's larger than you think would fit in a sprint car. Not a traditional build for a sprint car driver.
1001.68 1005.68 speaker1  Do it.
1004.68 1009.68 speaker3  Say something.
1007.68 1028.68 speaker1  Yo, large Eddie, fucking do it. Fucking do it. Fucking do it. Do it, dude, push me in the face, dude. Oh damn, okay.
1025.68 1047.68 speaker3  Yeah, you swing away, what happens?
1045.68 1077.68 speaker1  Okay, so let me get this straight.
1076.68 1099.68 speaker2  Yeah, you can kick him in the ball. Okay. Do your legs work? Actually, you know what? It's inconsistent with the injuries I've received to be able to kick him in the balls.
1097.68 1125.68 speaker3  Everything hurts right now, to be honest. There are still fancy men chasing us. And there are fancy men that might be chasing you. You haven't looked back. Oh, Justin. I look back. I assess the situation. There's actually no one there.
1123.68 1165.68 speaker1  A spooky portent of things to come. So I look at the man. Is the man coming towards me? Now you get the fuck out of our way and let us go about our day. I got to take this injured boy to the local doctor hospital. Fine.
1162.68 1171.68 speaker3  And he goes to throw a punch at Don.
1170.68 1188.68 speaker1  Catch these hands. And what happens next? Yeah. And smoke starts coming out of it. I assume it hurts. And he starts screaming.
1186.68 1196.68 speaker3  He's like, ah. Oh God. Oh, Don.
1193.68 1209.68 speaker1  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I hold on for a couple more seconds.
1208.68 1219.68 speaker3  He gets his crew. They set your car down and he, and he gets out of there as fast as he possibly can.
1217.68 1229.68 speaker1  I'm going to show him how a real man drives. Damn, Don. You owe me so much goddamn money.
1228.68 1236.68 speaker2  I know, Don.
1232.68 1264.68 speaker3  You're just like from one place to the next and then you end up in the hospital. I think we're finished with that.
1260.68 1267.68 speaker1  Keith Vigna, roll me an intelligence check real quick.
1265.68 1299.68 speaker3  Pass 16 on 50. He's very smart. Okay. On his bottom half of his body, like waders. Wait, I forgot what we know already. You saw in the house, the guy slumped over with the bolt hole in his head, the unkempt man, he was wearing big rubber waders. What do we know about James? Not that. Go ahead and Clark and John, who has the higher intelligence between you guys? I've got a 55. 75.
1297.68 1312.68 speaker2  All right, John, go ahead and roll.
1307.68 1334.68 speaker3  Also, looking at the address that Keith has written down from the phone book, you would notice that the address for James is on the same street in the suburbs as the house that Dr. Marie Jacobs lives in. Okay. So it's likely that that was James. We should go to the mill. Yeah, let's not examine this at all. I mean, James is dead.
1333.68 1338.68 speaker2  He might not be. He was in the house explosion, though.
1337.68 1344.68 speaker3  With a bullet hole in his head.
1343.68 1352.68 speaker2  Double dead. Double dude?
1350.68 1360.68 speaker1  It just reminded him.
1355.68 1386.68 speaker3  and he didn't pick up on every detail that was happening around him at the time. So I went ahead and had him roll intelligence to recall a detail that had been forgotten to him before. Perfect. I dig it.
1385.68 1423.68 speaker2  Gary said something. Thank you. That is almost police work. It might not be Maggie.
1419.68 1429.68 speaker1  We do know that her car, though, was at the mill for an extended period of time.
1425.68 1436.68 speaker2  We ought to, I don't think we need to do the dentist thing anymore, because I'm pretty sure that was James. And then what was the other thing? Oh, the church. The helmet.
1435.68 1444.68 speaker1  I think-
1441.68 1497.68 speaker2  I think the mill is going to tie a lot of things together. Right now, a loose end is that helmet out in civilian hands with God knows what it is. That way we know a little more. Yeah, and the camera. I hate to say this, though. Maybe we should split up, because time might be of the essence in both these matters. Take home a pho. Take home a pho? Do you get the pho to go?
1496.68 1504.68 speaker3  Seafood.
1503.68 1544.68 speaker2  To go, please. One small seafood pho to go. Extra pho. I totally feel like Zach is gonna fuck us, and like something's going down at the mill right now, and like we have to be there. We should not split up. I think maybe we should stick together for this one? We shouldn't trust anything to make no-
1540.68 1563.68 speaker3  I think if you guys split up and one of you went to the mill, one of you went to the church, one of you went to James, the mill worker, like the guy who worked at the mill, his house, like if one of you went to each of those locations- That would be fine. It would be fine.
1561.68 1590.68 speaker1  What would- We now have this new purpose given to us by an unknown entity of figuring out crazy shit, which would be the helmet. But, as police officers, we've worked with Maggie for a long time, so the mill would also- We would have it in our hearts to be- So that's why I'm saying we're real conflicted about what would be important to us.
1587.68 1612.68 speaker2  Wait, okay, we don't have to ask them any fucking questions. All we have to do is bust into that church and say- Give it to us. We're confiscating this helmet like it's part of the- It's evidence in an investigation. And then we go to the mill right after. Let's do it. Let's try that. Let's do it. Good police work, guys. Where's the church at? Yeah, where's the mill at?
1610.68 1613.68 speaker3  Oh, shit, that's real handy.
1612.68 1617.68 speaker2  That's real handy.
1615.68 1621.68 speaker1  Maybe we should go to the mill first.
1620.68 1630.68 speaker3  Of the town. Of the city. Oh, really? It's like on the other side of the big city?
1629.68 1635.68 speaker2  But all these people work there?
1634.68 1638.68 speaker3  It's not a bad-
1637.68 1640.68 speaker2  Same.
1639.68 1642.68 speaker3  Yeah, well, you were fucking wrong.
1641.68 1644.68 speaker1  Let's go over here and then head on out to the mill.
1643.68 1659.68 speaker2  Let's swing by the church. It's literally right around the corner. There's no reason not to. Sounds good.
1653.68 1756.68 speaker3  The quickest path to the church of contention would take you over a small bridge. There is a creek running underneath the bridge. And as you go over the bridge, you would all notice something pretty odd. The water is filled with animals. There are dogs and cats hanging out in the water. There are also raccoons, skunks, squirrels, possums, badgers, weasels, and minks all hanging out in the water. Do I see an old black lab? Go ahead and search for me. They are all hanging out in what would be the deepest part of the water, the most center part, furthest away from land on either side. All the animals are facing the land, and they all look to be on edge, but they're all in the water.
1754.68 1773.68 speaker2  What if they know something we don't?
1771.68 1800.68 speaker3  Pool party for the animals.
1799.68 1808.68 speaker2  Get in water. Get in water, yeah.
1806.68 1829.68 speaker1  You say over the radio? I just thought maybe it ran over here with all these other animals. Yeah, I didn't see it up there.
1828.68 1834.68 speaker2  That's what she thought. Were they feeding dogs?
1833.68 1851.68 speaker1  That's ridiculous. Those homeless people you saw? Nope. At the time.
1849.68 1858.68 speaker3  It is one of the largest...
1857.68 1860.68 speaker1  It's greasy as hell.
1858.68 1874.68 speaker2  It's some weight, church.
1865.68 1910.68 speaker3  The entirety of the wall facing the street is made of enormous windows with a massive stained glass cross in its center. The parking lot is the size of a football field. And an electronic sign displays the time, temperature, and the hours of the different services. It also currently has a slide that says in all caps, Free meal for anyone who needs it. Just come inside. As you guys park in the parking lot, go ahead and roll an alertness check for me, John. What do you guys want to do?
1908.68 1918.68 speaker2  48 degrees. Okay, that was just a wild stab at the dark at the thing I was supposed to pass my alertness roll for.
1916.68 1920.68 speaker1  I just think we just go in.
1918.68 1932.68 speaker2  Yeah, everything seems fine to me. Do we know what day it is? It's December 4th.
1929.68 1940.68 speaker1  Ramona wanted out. She was just like, I'm gone. You guys are nerds. If that fucks up the...
1938.68 1955.68 speaker3  That's a good question though, whether it's Sunday or not. It started on Monday. How about that? Monday night was when we started, and so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. It's Thursday at noon. Let's just go in. There's no reason to call and ask.
1953.68 1957.68 speaker1  So yeah, that's what we're here for.
1955.68 1970.68 speaker2  And it's a church. There's no way that they're gonna be... How full is the parking lot?
1966.68 1980.68 speaker3  I'm gonna stay in the parking lot just in case.
1979.68 1990.68 speaker2  Yeah, I will. I'll sit in the cruiser and listen to NPR.
1989.68 2006.68 speaker3  Rock. Oh, I have to leave? I mean...
2004.68 2014.68 speaker1  You know what? That's kind of realistic. You don't wanna miss out on whatever's going on inside.
2010.68 2027.68 speaker3  Okay, cool. So when you guys walk through the front doors, the church is mostly empty. But you can hear a rumble of noise coming from down the stairs. Hey, do any of us go to this church?
2025.68 2031.68 speaker1  Yeah, I went here when I was a kid.
2028.68 2041.68 speaker2  So we know the layout of the church. We just haven't been in a while.
2040.68 2047.68 speaker3  Adam Cain.
2043.68 2070.68 speaker1  Would I know where Pastor Cain's office is? Or is there maybe signage that would tell me?
2068.68 2094.68 speaker3  And the door is locked. You hear no response. I'm gonna use my lock picking skill to pick the lock. Wait, wait, wait.
2087.68 2120.68 speaker2  While he does that, I go and try to find an administrative assistant or anybody who works here to ask where somebody is.
2118.68 2143.68 speaker1  Keith, what are you doing? Get out of there.
2137.68 2154.68 speaker3  There's a desk for a secretary, but she is or he is not sitting at the desk. But you do hear that noise coming from, there's a large stairwell that goes downstairs. And it sounds like there's- And the lights are on down there and you can hear noise coming from down there.
2153.68 2155.68 speaker2  I'm heading down there.
2154.68 2184.68 speaker3  Sounds good. Back in the office, Keith, you see sitting on the desk of the pastor, there is an old motorcycle helmet. And it has some tubes on either side of it. And there are two lights on it, one green, one red, and the red one is lit up.
2183.68 2236.68 speaker2  No. I grab it. I don't put it on, but I grab it and I am going to go outside and look at that motorcycle. Scary stuff happens. Scary stuff happens. Oh, it's not.
2235.68 2242.68 speaker3  My craft is lock picking. Okay. I have 20 in computer science.
2241.68 2251.68 speaker1  Okay. Then, yeah. You guys are good?
2247.68 2270.68 speaker2  Actually, instead of going out to check the motorcycle out- Sounds good.
2261.68 2334.68 speaker3  As you go down there, you see there's an extremely large room at the base of the stairs and there are a bunch of tables set up. There is a long line of people. Each person in line kind of looks down on their luck and the line leads to a serving window where there are a few people scooping pasta and salad onto paper plates. And just past the food is Pastor Adam Cain and he is praying with each person who goes through the line when they grab their food. He's doing a quick prayer with them and then they head to a table and start chowing down. He has eyes that are so dark that the irises look black and he seems to be in his early 30s. Everything he does seems to be deliberate and he's praying with each person who comes through and in between two people, you walk right up to him.
2331.68 2383.68 speaker2  What are y'all putting on today? I mean, nothing in particular. The homeless reports we had gotten, right, were about the homeless disappearing, right? Or they were about the being a bunch of homeless? We've been hearing about an awful lot of homeless people coming into contention and you pray with these people. You minister to them. Have they been telling you where they're coming from? What troubles have brought them here?
2378.68 2390.68 speaker3  They all are down on their luck and I am here to feed them.
2388.68 2473.68 speaker2  Hey, you know, the reason I'm here today. We've been dealing with some things going on in this town. Some stuff is coming together. We had a pretty important ongoing investigation and unfortunately, eh, this is gonna just sound strange, but... We heard that the church had purchased a helmet from a flea market, a motorcycle helmet. That is unfortunately related to an investigation we are conducting right now. Should have never been on sale. Let's just put it that way. So we're gonna need to take that in for evidence if y'all still have it. Absolutely not.
2469.68 2481.68 speaker3  Keith holding the helmet underneath one of his arms. And as you all approach each other...
2480.68 2489.68 speaker2  Why?
2484.68 2501.68 speaker1  Oh, uh, pastor, your office was open back there. We found the helmet we needed.
2495.68 2517.68 speaker2  um, save you the trouble from having to go back up there and then we'd come tell you that we got it and head on our way. Yeah, I mean... That's correct. That's...
2516.68 2521.68 speaker3  Oh. Fuck.
2520.68 2542.68 speaker1  That's a hundow.
2540.68 2545.68 speaker3  So is that all you need?
2544.68 2546.68 speaker2  Why'd you buy that?
2545.68 2565.68 speaker3  What kind of food?
2564.68 2589.68 speaker1  Oh, yeah, definitely.
2587.68 2645.68 speaker3  He's trying, you know. He's trying. So what was the question that you asked me? Have you ever ridden one? Oh, is that your bike out there? Heavenly. It's wonderful. You should buy a new helmet. Then I suppose I am once again in the market for a helmet.
2641.68 2646.68 speaker2  We are gonna have to give you a ticket, so you should probably get that taken care of immediately.
2645.68 2667.68 speaker3  Well, I will indeed. I'll have you know that I am working on legislation to have that particular law removed. Thank you, Pastor.
2663.68 2690.68 speaker2  You know, Clark's right, these are dangerous machines. It frankly seems irresponsible of somebody, you know, who has his own flock to be introducing this kind of legislation to the community.
2688.68 2762.68 speaker1  That is my goal, yes.
2760.68 2774.68 speaker3  It's like a rudimentary quality assurance. Absolutely. I thought it was quite clever of the original makers, although I didn't find a name on it, interestingly enough. Have you seen what these lights do?
2772.68 2788.68 speaker2  I'm sorry, lights? Yeah, the red and green light.
2787.68 2801.68 speaker3  So once? I suppose so, yes. When was that? Well, it's, you know, there was, you know, some weather conflicts, and I stayed home one day, and... Oh, okay.
2797.68 2831.68 speaker2  I've only gotten to ride it once, but it was quite thrilling. Hey, Pastor, what does the Bible say about animals congregating in funny ways in streams, or creeks?
2826.68 2833.68 speaker3  You know, it's not every day that you get to see a mink and a raccoon interact.
2831.68 2864.68 speaker2  Yeah, for sure. No, I mean, thank God for all these creatures. They give us company and nutrition. Pasta and salad.
