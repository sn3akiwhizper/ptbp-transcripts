0	6540	What is up my babies, do y'all know what time it is?
6540	12220	It's time for your ear holes to get filled up by y'alls truly, Wolf, the dog.
12220	18480	And your ears are absorbing these sounds from Contentions greatest radio show, broadcasting
18480	22640	from 694.2 PTBP.
22640	27680	This week's Howlin' with Wolf was submitted by a listener who tagged that pretending pod
27680	30220	in their Instagram story.
30220	34240	What a fuckin' champ, spreading the good news like that.
34240	41120	They write, Better buckle up baby, because your new favorite band, Buckle Up Baby, is
41120	44800	dropping their first tape this Friday, March 8th.
44800	47720	Don't sleep on this one, don't be late.
47720	51000	If you like fun, then save the date.
51000	56460	Buckle Up Baby is celebrating their tape release with a live musical performance alongside
56460	62060	Suzy Trash, Casual Cal, and Contentions own, Kudzu.
62060	69380	This Friday, March 8th at 1703, South Fremont in Springfield, Missouri.
69380	71980	That place sounds made up, y'all.
71980	75140	Check out the track and use the internet to learn more.
75140	104460	You are a bad teacher.
104460	106740	Hell yes, my brothers.
106740	109700	Now time for the news.
109700	113420	Listeners were treated to a blast from Clark Bishop's past.
113420	118820	But it was less of a treat for Clark, who found himself locked in the public library
118820	123460	with Gerald Fingerson as the sky turned completely dark.
123460	129860	The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit.
129860	133740	That sadly was not the worst of it, my babies.
133740	141180	Clark got back home only to find his reality shattering, eventually remembering the confession
141180	143860	of the woman who killed his parents.
143860	147920	Man, I didn't know they had a new Clark dirty like that.
147920	153580	Back in the real world, the officers went to the Daily Fur after Gary Daly called in
153580	157400	to report information about the chief's disappearance.
157400	163020	They learned the chief arrived to her home accompanied by James, who works at the mill,
163020	166180	and another man who held them at gunpoint.
166180	170100	The gunman was in all black and had a scar over his eye.
170100	175700	Gary Daly saw this because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who
175700	178280	took Drew to the chief's home.
178280	184400	The officers, always utilizing their time mighty efficiently, spent a while asking Gary
184400	188780	Daly about the art he was hanging in his restaurant.
188780	194860	Now y'all know your old buddy Wolf is a connoisseur of sorts of the arts, but the only art he
194860	199900	ever has time for is Kudzu's No Backbone.
218780	231500	All right, welcome everybody.
231500	236620	We are doing flashbacks today and right now we're doing a John Lee Pettymore's flashback
236620	241460	and our friend Justin is here with us today to play, who are you playing?
241460	245300	I am playing one Don D. Pettymore.
245300	246580	And who is that?
246580	250920	I am this John Lee Pettymore's uncle.
250920	251920	Kind of uncle.
251920	256500	I'm his dad's cousin, but I'm only like 13, 14 years older than him.
256500	257500	Yeah.
257500	258500	Does that sound good?
258500	259500	Mm-hmm.
259500	260500	Does it sound good?
260500	261500	I need to look at the mic more.
261500	263880	Can I rearrange it really quick?
263880	265960	Just pretend like the mic is...
265960	266960	One with me?
266960	270180	A muppet that you never want to kiss, but that always wants to kiss you.
270180	271180	But you want to get real close?
271180	272860	You got to stay just out.
272860	275240	You're trying to tease the muppet.
275240	279120	Something you always want to stay out of.
279120	281080	Just don't let the muppet get what it wants.
281080	282080	Stay away.
282080	283240	Never let a muppet get what it wants.
283240	284240	No.
284240	285240	I think that's...
285240	286880	If you give a muppet a cookie.
286880	288200	I mean, crumbs are everywhere.
288200	289200	It'll get everywhere.
289200	292240	Have you ever tried to clean a fucking muppet?
292240	302800	All right, so today we are flashing back to an essential moment, a very important time
302800	306880	in the life of John Lee Pettymore.
306880	313460	This is the moment that John Lee Pettymore's sprint car racing career is cut short in a
313460	315320	horrible accident.
315320	317680	And John Lee Pettymore has prepared a little monologue.
317680	319680	I believe you've prepared some words.
319680	322680	About his experience, yes.
322680	327640	Hold on, let me...
327640	340640	What propels a man?
340640	344040	What propels a man to seek glory?
344040	349660	What propels a man to test his mettle, to meld his talents with that of a machine and
349660	353480	together seek victory?
353480	357720	What was propelling me through the air and towards the hard steel of the Contention County
357720	360040	Speedway's main grandstand?
360040	365000	I briefly had time to consider all this as I was thrown free of my sprint car and head
365000	370020	first into the abundant lap of Mrs. Eldora Jane Duncans.
370020	374440	To her great fortune, God saw fit to place a support girder in my trajectory, and that
374440	379000	girder shattered my pelvis and snapped my right leg, sparing Mrs. Eldora the full force
379000	380720	of my impact.
380720	384520	Dear boy, Elvis Jr. was not as lucky.
384520	389420	The flying buckle of my defective safety harness took his eye in an instant.
389420	391760	God was all out of girders.
391760	393080	What propels a man?
393080	397100	I didn't figure that one out before I lost consciousness, but as I flew towards the grandstands
397100	400760	I could see with perfect clarity who had propelled me there.
400760	402400	Laura Jetty.
402400	403400	Dickhead.
403400	404400	Chucklefuck.
404400	405400	Shitbird.
405400	408620	King of the sprint racing circuit.
408620	412300	She had cut across my line and forced me into a wall.
412300	415860	The corners I had cut to get there in the first place did the rest.
415860	419780	Ordering a race-used harness in fair condition from eBay wasn't the best idea, but I could
419780	422460	only stretch Uncle Don's money so far.
422460	428360	Turns out it stretched just as far as a young boy's eye, which was farther than my luck.
428360	433420	Every scrap of it that had propelled me here had burnt out.
433420	437940	Don D. Pettymore looked out at the world from dead eyes.
438060	442300	Uncle Don came from the hard side of the family, the side that had starved before and vowed
442300	446300	to never starve again, and now I owed him real money.
446300	451140	Adora's screams grew more distant as I faded out of consciousness, and the last thing I
451140	455260	remember seeing is Uncle Don's unknowable expression, peering straight down at me.
456940	458940	Fuck yeah!
458940	460940	That's some good shit.
460940	462940	Thank you, that's uh...
462940	464940	I'm not really, uh...
464940	468940	John Lee Pettymore, me, is not the creative writing type, so...
468940	470940	But uh...
470940	477940	My physical therapist, Jane, she really worked me through my shattered pelvis and leg, and
477940	478940	she suggested that...
478940	479940	Journaling?
479940	482940	Well, yeah, I mean, in other words...
482940	483940	Writing prose and whatnot?
483940	492340	Well, yeah, she suggested that perhaps my mental spiritual self was also shattered like
492340	495340	my pelvis, and that it might help to get some of that out.
495340	499340	Dude, a haiku or two would heal you.
499340	501340	Haiku?
501340	503340	That didn't come out right.
503340	504340	Hold up.
504340	506340	Haiku?
509340	511340	Okay, let me get some of those names.
511340	515340	I crashed into the family of Miss Aldora Jane Duncans.
515340	517340	Aldora Jane Duncans?
517340	519340	Yeah, married to Elvis Duncans.
519340	520340	How do you spell Duncans?
520340	522340	Duncans like the donuts.
522340	523340	And...
523340	524340	Not like the basketball?
524340	529340	No, also like the basketball, but if you're doing it with an apostrophe.
529340	530340	Okay.
530340	532340	If you're Duncan.
532340	534340	And her son was in the race?
534340	540340	No, her son was seated next to her, the young Elvis Duncans Jr.
540340	546340	And my safety buckle, which had separated, it was a defective piece of equipment that
546340	551340	what happened there is that it flew into the young boy's eye and took it from him, as
551340	557340	the Lord is wont to take many things from us in his mysterious and unknowable mycenations.
557340	559340	Mycenations.
559340	561340	Oh, man.
561340	563340	Oh, man, talking so hard.
563340	565340	Talking so goddamn hard, man.
565340	567340	I hate talking.
567340	569340	Fuck.
569340	575340	Okay, so we're going to cut to the scene.
575340	581340	Don and John are sitting in the back of the ambulance from the Contention County Speedway,
581340	589340	and the EMT who works there is checking out John, and actually she kind of walks up and
589340	593340	eh, well, eh, there's just no way.
593340	594340	Never going to race again.
594340	597340	I don't see any way around it.
597340	602340	Yeah, I mean, I don't see myself ever getting the money together to get back into something
602340	606340	like this, but how did you know that about me?
606340	612340	Oh, no, I just mean that there's no way that you're going to be able to race again, not
612340	614340	around here at least, that's for sure.
614340	616340	You're just, you're an EMT.
616340	619340	You're not involved with the race officials or anything.
619340	622340	Why are you, what a thing to tell a man in recovery.
622340	629340	She kind of pulls Don aside, and you can very clearly hear her talking.
629340	637340	She's just like, yeah, well, see the issue being that for sure the Duncans aren't going
637340	641340	to take too kindly to their boy losing an eye.
641340	647340	You know how, you know, Patriarch Duncan owns the Contention County Speedway as well as
647340	651340	almost all the speedways in this region.
651340	658340	I just don't see any way that he's going to allow Jon to get on the track ever again.
658340	661340	So I think y'all might be done fucked.
661340	663340	My dreams.
663340	665340	My dang dreams.
665340	667340	My dang dreams.
667340	669340	My dang dreams.
669340	672340	What are you trying to tell me?
672340	673340	That my dream is over?
673340	675340	I turn away from.
675340	677340	Her name is Ernti.
677340	678340	Ernti.
678340	685340	I turn away from Ernti and I look at my boy who, wait, is his dad dead?
685340	686340	Yes.
686340	692340	Okay, I wasn't sure if I, I look at him like he's my own, my own son.
692340	693340	He is my own flesh and blood.
693340	697340	And I walk over to him and I grab his face and I look at him.
697340	699340	Uncle Don, how?
699340	700340	Look at me boy.
700340	703340	You're going to have to give up on this dream now.
703340	704340	Don't.
704340	705340	You got to face reality, boy.
705340	706340	No, Don.
706340	707340	You got to face it.
707340	708340	No, Don.
708340	711340	Why am I going to face it today, Don?
711340	713340	What am I going to do?
713340	718340	I pull his head gingerly towards my head and give him a warm embrace that I've given no
718340	719340	one before.
719340	721340	I didn't expect this kind of thing from you.
721340	722340	It's okay, boy.
722340	723340	We're going to be all right.
723340	724340	I owe you so much money.
724340	726340	Yeah, we're going to figure that out.
726340	729340	Are you going to kill me?
729340	732340	I say nothing.
732340	733340	Whoa.
734340	741340	So John asks if Don is going to kill him and Don just stares coldly at him.
741340	750340	And next we see Don pushing John in a wheelchair because you can't afford that ambulance ride.
750340	754340	Not after you lost a lot of money in that crash just now.
754340	758340	So you decide to drive and on your way, actually it's kind of weird.
758340	763340	Don, you see these two figures.
763340	766340	John, you don't see this because you're in a wheelchair.
766340	772340	But Don, you see these two figures that are watching you from behind, kind of on the side
772340	773340	of the track.
773340	778340	And as you're walking out, they begin approaching you from the back.
778340	786680	They are both extremely tall people with large frames, but they are very gaunt and they begin
786680	789020	walking faster and faster toward you.
789020	793680	And they are going to catch up with you if you don't begin to move a bit faster there.
793680	794680	John, you ready to hustle, boy?
794680	797680	We're getting off this track.
797680	798680	I'm in a wheelchair, man.
798680	799680	How am I going to hustle?
799680	801680	I start shoveling on real quick.
801680	804680	Whoa, Don, we're going too fast.
804680	810180	You guys are flying and Don is just running in a full sprint at this point with John in
810180	811680	the wheelchair ahead of him.
811680	814680	And these two figures are catching up.
814680	816680	There's no one else around, weirdly enough.
816680	821680	As soon as you see them, no one else seems to be on the track.
821680	826680	And you see as they're approaching on you, Don, you're looking backward as you're running.
826680	833680	They're both wearing black suits and their skin is weirdly translucent.
833680	839680	And as you guys are running and running and running, one of them just starts screaming.
839680	848680	This, like, weird, banshee type yell is just like...
848680	851680	As they're running toward you and then...
851680	857680	Hey, hey, you fancy, you fancy men, you fucking stay away.
857680	860680	Go on.
860680	867680	Get, get, as you yell, get at these fancy men that are following you.
867680	871680	Fanciest men John Lee Bettymore has ever seen.
871680	878680	You turn back to look at the parking lot and not only is the parking lot full of people,
878680	887680	but you do see your car, Don, that you both came in today.
887680	890680	Hell yeah.
890680	893680	Surrogate, son.
893680	898680	And, actually, large Eddie.
898680	908680	Hold up, please give me time to think of a dope Second Cousins fucking pun.
908680	910680	I got nothing.
910680	911680	It's hard.
911680	916680	Second Cousins give good loving, that's not very good.
916680	918680	That's just the Hall & Oates song.
918680	922680	Second Cousins give good loving.
922680	925680	Oh boy, we missed it.
925680	927680	You missed it, it's my song.
927680	938680	As you're looking into the parking lot, you would see that your car is currently being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit grew.
938680	940680	What the hell, Eddie?
940680	941680	God damn it, Eddie.
941680	949680	Eddie, you fucking knocked me out of this race, you son of a bitch, you dickhead fuck, and now you're gonna fuck with my car, you piece of shit, and I'm in this goddamn wheelchair?
949680	952680	Eddie, you're gonna rule the day you fucked with the petty, Morris.
952680	958680	I'm gonna do whatever it is I wanna do, cause I'm large Eddie.
958680	968680	And he begins walking toward you guys as his crew continues to try to lift, but they're clearly having a harder time now that large Eddie isn't helping them.
968680	969680	How large is he?
969680	971680	And so they're trying to make it.
971680	973680	He's like 6'5", which is not a-
973680	975680	He's larger than you think would fit in a sprint car.
976680	979680	Not a traditional build for a sprint car driver.
979680	982680	He seems as large as a sprint car is.
982680	991680	He is, yeah, he's thick, he's skinny strong though, you know, he's like, he's stringy, but he's real strong looking.
991680	996680	And he walks right up to Don and he's like, say something.
996680	997680	Do it.
1000680	1001680	Do it.
1001680	1002680	Do it.
1002680	1004680	Don't make me fucking do it, Eddie.
1004680	1005680	Say something.
1005680	1007680	Hey, I'm walking, I'm large Eddie, I'm walking here.
1007680	1009680	Yo, large Eddie, fucking do it.
1009680	1010680	Fucking do it.
1010680	1011680	Fucking do it.
1011680	1013680	Do it, dude, push me in the face, dude.
1013680	1014680	Fucking do it, Don.
1014680	1016680	Don, you think you got shit?
1016680	1021680	I take quite a large swing at this gentleman right in the face.
1021680	1023680	Oh damn, okay.
1023680	1024680	Oh damn.
1025680	1028680	Yeah, you swing away, what happens?
1028680	1033680	I just clock that son of a bitch in the face for fucking with me and my boy cousin.
1033680	1038680	Large Eddie, you loud-mouthed son of a bitch, that's what you get, you fucking piece of shit.
1038680	1040680	God damn, Uncle Don.
1042680	1044680	This is man's business now.
1045680	1047680	Okay, so let me get this straight.
1049680	1058680	This guy walks up, he's talking shit, you hit him, John starts talking shit to this guy on the ground and you tell him to shut the fuck up?
1058680	1061680	Shut your mouth, bull ass, and respect.
1063680	1068680	Large Eddie gets up again and looks at you and he just like...
1068680	1073680	You know, he does that thing where he like grabs his jaw and he starts rubbing it.
1073680	1076680	Am I close enough in my wheelchair to kick him in the ball with my cowboy boots?
1076680	1077680	Yeah, you can kick him in the ball.
1077680	1078680	Okay.
1078680	1079680	Do your legs work?
1079680	1081680	Oh yeah, well, not my right one.
1082680	1083680	Actually, you know what?
1083680	1087680	It's inconsistent with the injuries I've received to be able to kick him in the balls.
1087680	1088680	Very inconsistent.
1088680	1092680	Anyway, I guess I just think real hard about kicking him in the balls and how cool it would be.
1092680	1094680	You want to. Oh, you want to so bad.
1094680	1095680	He just sees it in my eyes.
1095680	1097680	But it hurts to think about it.
1097680	1099680	Everything hurts right now, to be honest.
1099680	1103680	My pelvis is shattered and I haven't been to the hospital yet. I'm just in a wheelchair.
1103680	1109680	You're extremely concussed. You're just sitting in a wheelchair. He just pushed you very rapidly over what I'm guessing is gravel.
1109680	1110680	There are still fancy men chasing us.
1110680	1111680	A lot of rocks.
1111680	1114680	And there are fancy men that might be chasing you. You haven't looked back.
1114680	1115680	Oh, Justin.
1115680	1118680	I look back. I assess the situation.
1118680	1119680	There's actually no one there.
1119680	1123680	Oh, that's scary. But good. For the moment, I suppose.
1123680	1125680	A spooky portent of things to come.
1125680	1129680	I do think that I need to solve this situation quick and forthright.
1129680	1132680	So I look at the man. Is the man coming towards me?
1132680	1138680	He's just, he's doing that thing with his jaw where he's just rubbing it and he's like, ah.
1138680	1141680	And he just kind of growls and then he spits on the ground.
1141680	1144680	Now you get the fuck out of our way and let us go about our day.
1144680	1149680	I got to take this injured boy to the local doctor hospital.
1152680	1153680	Fine.
1153680	1154680	Yeah, what do you got to say to that, Eddie?
1154680	1162680	He looks down and he's like, you're going to need to go to the city hospital after I get done with you.
1162680	1165680	And he goes to throw a punch at Don.
1165680	1169680	I mutter under my breath as I catch his hand with my hand.
1170680	1171680	Catch these hands.
1172680	1174680	But I'm literally catching his hand.
1174680	1176680	And what happens next?
1176680	1181680	His hand starts a sizzling like a, like a country fried steak on a Sunday morning.
1181680	1182680	Yeah.
1182680	1184680	And smoke starts coming out of it.
1184680	1185680	I assume it hurts.
1185680	1186680	And he starts screaming.
1186680	1188680	He's like, ah.
1188680	1191680	Oh God. Oh, Don.
1191680	1193680	And I'm like, Eddie, you ready to stop, boy?
1193680	1196680	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1196680	1198680	I hold on for a couple more seconds.
1198680	1200680	Oh, it's excruciating.
1200680	1204680	I drop his hand and then I give him one more in the face again.
1204680	1206680	He runs away like a beat dog.
1206680	1208680	He, I mean, he just runs away.
1208680	1209680	He gets his crew.
1209680	1214680	They set your car down and he, and he gets out of there as fast as he possibly can.
1215680	1217680	I want to shovel my boy into that there car.
1217680	1219680	I'm going to show him how a real man drives.
1221680	1222680	Damn, Don.
1222680	1224680	Why do you got to kick a man while he's down?
1225680	1226680	I was driving pretty good today.
1226680	1228680	You owe me so much goddamn money.
1228680	1229680	I know, Don.
1229680	1232680	Don, in your concussed state, man, you have no idea what's been going on.
1232680	1236680	You're just like from one place to the next and then you end up in the hospital.
1236680	1238680	Did we get brunch with Large Eddie?
1240680	1241680	I think we're finished with that.
1244680	1246680	Did we get brunch with Large Eddie?
1260680	1264680	Keith Vigna, roll me an intelligence check real quick.
1265680	1267680	Pass 16 on 50.
1267680	1269680	He's very smart.
1269680	1275680	The hunched over guy, unkempt, was wearing large rubber waders.
1275680	1276680	Okay.
1276680	1279680	On his bottom half of his body, like waders.
1279680	1281680	Wait, I forgot what we know already.
1281680	1286680	You saw in the house, the guy slumped over with the bolt hole in his head, the unkempt man,
1286680	1288680	he was wearing big rubber waders.
1288680	1289680	What do we know about James?
1289680	1290680	Not that.
1290680	1295680	Go ahead and Clark and John, who has the higher intelligence between you guys?
1295680	1296680	I've got a 55.
1296680	1297680	75.
1297680	1299680	All right, John, go ahead and roll.
1299680	1301680	57 on a 75.
1301680	1307680	You would remember that the man with the vacuum in his front yard was also wearing rubber waders.
1307680	1312680	Also, looking at the address that Keith has written down from the phone book,
1312680	1317680	you would notice that the address for James is on the same street in the suburbs
1317680	1320680	as the house that Dr. Marie Jacobs lives in.
1320680	1321680	Okay.
1321680	1323680	So it's likely that that was James.
1323680	1327680	That the guy in rubber waders that you saw on that street is James.
1327680	1328680	We should go to the mill.
1328680	1331680	Yeah, let's not examine this at all.
1331680	1332680	I mean, James is dead.
1332680	1333680	Long live James.
1333680	1334680	He might not be.
1334680	1336680	He was in the house explosion, though.
1336680	1337680	Was he?
1337680	1338680	With a bullet hole in his head.
1338680	1339680	Oh, that's, yeah, fuck.
1339680	1343680	He was dead before the house exploded, and he's double dead now.
1343680	1344680	Double dead.
1344680	1345680	Double dude?
1345680	1350680	I guess Joe is asking, why did Keith have that realization suddenly?
1350680	1352680	It just reminded him.
1352680	1355680	I mean, it was a very tense moment when he was going through the house,
1355680	1360680	and he didn't pick up on every detail that was happening around him at the time.
1360680	1366680	So I went ahead and had him roll intelligence to recall a detail that had been forgotten to him before.
1366680	1367680	Perfect.
1367680	1368680	I dig it.
1368680	1374680	I think we ought to follow up on the leads that we were looking at before the whole Nike bag thing.
1374680	1379680	Well, I mean, from our standpoint, we know our chief is dead, and she was-
1379680	1385680	As far as we know, but also remember how you came in and talked to Drew, and it wasn't you?
1385680	1386680	Gary said something.
1386680	1391680	Keith, that is the first smart thing you have ever said.
1391680	1392680	Thank you.
1392680	1400680	I just, I remembered Gary said something along the lines of, she wasn't standing up straight the way that Chief Cook would.
1400680	1402680	That is almost police work.
1402680	1404680	Good work on that there, Keith.
1404680	1406680	It might not be Maggie.
1406680	1416680	I mean, I saw her with my own eyes, but these days I don't know if I believe what I see anymore.
1416680	1419680	We do know that her car, though, was at the mill.
1419680	1423680	We do know that her car, though, was at the mill for an extended period of time.
1423680	1425680	Right, and that's why I think we ought to check out the mill.
1425680	1429680	We ought to, I don't think we need to do the dentist thing anymore, because I'm pretty sure that was James.
1429680	1431680	And then what was the other thing?
1431680	1432680	Oh, the church.
1432680	1433680	The helmet.
1433680	1435680	Should we go to the church or the mill first?
1435680	1436680	I think-
1438680	1439680	Fuck.
1439680	1441680	Because her dad worked at the mill, right?
1441680	1444680	I think the mill is going to tie a lot of things together.
1444680	1451680	Right now, a loose end is that helmet out in civilian hands with God knows what it is.
1451680	1453680	Let's go get the helmet, because we got all the other things.
1453680	1455680	We might as well have it all together.
1455680	1457680	That way we know a little more.
1457680	1462680	We ought to just go do it now, because we have the gun, we have the radio-
1462680	1464680	Yeah, and the camera.
1464680	1465680	And the camera.
1465680	1466680	I hate to say this, though.
1466680	1470680	Maybe we should split up, because time might be of the essence in both these matters.
1470680	1472680	I'll go to the church.
1472680	1474680	What do you think is more important?
1474680	1476680	That's a great question.
1479680	1481680	What time is it right now?
1481680	1483680	Oh, it's probably noon.
1483680	1486680	I go back in and I get a pho to go.
1486680	1487680	Pho to go?
1487680	1488680	Pho to go.
1488680	1489680	A pho to go?
1489680	1490680	A pho to go.
1490680	1491680	Take home a pho.
1491680	1492680	Take home a pho?
1492680	1493680	Do you get the pho to go?
1493680	1495680	Hey, Gary, what's your most popular pho?
1495680	1496680	Tri-tip.
1496680	1497680	Seafood.
1497680	1500680	Ooh, what kind of- what's a seafood?
1500680	1502680	Oh, it's got all sorts of tentacles in there.
1502680	1503680	Yeah, give me that.
1503680	1504680	To go, please.
1504680	1506680	One small seafood pho to go.
1506680	1507680	Okay.
1507680	1509680	Extra pho.
1509680	1514680	One small seafood pho extra pho coming right up.
1514680	1517680	What do you guys want you- who should hit where?
1517680	1519680	I'm just so hesitant to split up.
1519680	1522680	I just- yeah, off- maybe off mic or just out of character.
1522680	1527680	I totally feel like Zach is gonna fuck us, and like something's going down at the mill right now,
1527680	1528680	and like we have to be there.
1528680	1529680	We should not split up.
1529680	1536680	As fun as it is to do, and as fun as it is to like, listen back and how much I fuck up on my own,
1536680	1538680	I think maybe we should stick together for this one?
1538680	1540680	We shouldn't trust anything to make no-
1540680	1544680	I think if you guys split up and one of you went to the mill, one of you went to the church,
1544680	1548680	one of you went to James, the mill worker, like the guy who worked at the mill, his house,
1548680	1551680	like if one of you went to each of those locations-
1551680	1553680	We might have accomplished a lot.
1553680	1554680	That would be fine.
1554680	1556680	It would be fine.
1556680	1559680	You say that, but- I mean, okay, what-
1559680	1561680	Fucking DMs.
1561680	1563680	What would-
1563680	1565680	I think that you would all have a great time.
1565680	1567680	What would a real police station do?
1567680	1569680	Well, okay, so that's what I was actually going through.
1569680	1575680	We now have this new purpose given to us by an unknown entity of figuring out crazy shit,
1575680	1577680	which would be the helmet.
1577680	1581680	But, as police officers, we've worked with Maggie for a long time, so the mill would also-
1581680	1584680	We would have it in our hearts to be-
1584680	1587680	So that's why I'm saying we're real conflicted about what would be important to us.
1587680	1590680	Wait, okay, we don't have to ask them any fucking questions.
1590680	1593680	All we have to do is bust into that church and say-
1593680	1594680	Give it to us.
1594680	1596680	We're confiscating this helmet like it's part of the-
1596680	1598680	It's evidence in an investigation.
1598680	1599680	And then we go to the mill right after.
1599680	1602680	We will talk to you about it later, but we need that right now.
1602680	1603680	Let's do it.
1603680	1604680	Let's try that.
1604680	1606680	Let's do it. Good police work, guys.
1606680	1607680	Where's the church at?
1607680	1608680	Yeah, where's the mill at?
1608680	1610680	Where's the church at, Keith asks.
1610680	1612680	Oh, shit, that's real handy.
1612680	1613680	That's real handy.
1613680	1615680	It's right around the corner for the listener.
1615680	1617680	Maybe we should go to the mill first.
1617680	1618680	Where is the mill?
1618680	1620680	The mill is on the other side of the city.
1620680	1621680	Of the town.
1621680	1622680	Of the city.
1622680	1624680	Oh, really? It's like on the other side of the big city?
1624680	1625680	The mill?
1625680	1629680	Yeah, well, let's definitely go swing by the church and then go out to the city.
1629680	1630680	But all these people work there?
1630680	1632680	I mean, how far away is it?
1632680	1634680	It's like 45 minutes to an hour away.
1634680	1635680	It's not a bad-
1635680	1637680	I just figured it was like the town's mill.
1637680	1638680	Same.
1638680	1639680	The mill.
1639680	1640680	Yeah, well, you were fucking wrong.
1640680	1641680	The mill.
1641680	1642680	Let's go over here and then head on out to the mill.
1642680	1643680	Yeah, I agree.
1643680	1644680	Let's swing by the church.
1644680	1646680	It's literally right around the corner.
1646680	1647680	There's no reason not to.
1647680	1648680	Sounds good.
1648680	1651680	Are you getting into one vehicle to go?
1651680	1652680	Let's take all three.
1652680	1653680	Yeah, let's take all three.
1653680	1659680	The quickest path to the church of contention would take you over a small bridge.
1659680	1663680	There is a creek running underneath the bridge.
1663680	1670680	And as you go over the bridge, you would all notice something pretty odd.
1670680	1676680	The water is filled with animals.
1676680	1680680	There are dogs and cats hanging out in the water.
1680680	1691680	There are also raccoons, skunks, squirrels, possums, badgers, weasels, and minks all hanging out in the water.
1691680	1693680	Do I see an old black lab?
1693680	1697680	Go ahead and search for me.
1697680	1699680	Fail, 95 on a 20.
1699680	1704680	You do not see an old black lab, but you do see all the aforementioned animals.
1704680	1713680	They are all hanging out in what would be the deepest part of the water, the most center part, furthest away from land on either side.
1713680	1718680	I want to slow down on the bridge, roll down my window, and go, Tyler!
1718680	1720680	Come here, Tyler!
1720680	1721680	You do that.
1721680	1723680	Any dog come up running my direction?
1723680	1725680	Do any of the animals look at him at all?
1725680	1728680	Or are they all focused on something in the creek?
1728680	1736680	All the animals are facing the land, and they all look to be on edge, but they're all in the water.
1736680	1739680	Do any of the cats resemble Marie Jacobs' cat?
1739680	1748680	In that part of the creek, there are three different black cats that all look to be similar.
1748680	1754680	Out of character, I'm thinking classic animals, you know, when they know a tornado's coming or some shit like that.
1754680	1756680	What if they know something we don't?
1757680	1760680	Because this is a very, very weird thing.
1760680	1763680	My sanity is at... I pass.
1763680	1764680	Hell yeah.
1764680	1765680	Yeah, I passed.
1765680	1767680	I passed. 21 on a 41.
1767680	1771680	Okay. What is your rationalization? Does none of you lose sanity?
1771680	1773680	Pool party for the animals.
1773680	1775680	It's hot outside.
1775680	1778680	It's hot out.
1778680	1783680	It's December. I mean, it's unseasonably warm still, I would say, but it is December.
1783680	1790680	Somebody must have dumped a bunch of real good animal food in that river, upriver, and it's all collected down here.
1790680	1793680	Maybe the cable factory has exploded.
1793680	1799680	Out of character, they probably know that maybe the goo or whatever we're fighting can't go...
1799680	1800680	Get in water.
1800680	1801680	Get in water, yeah.
1801680	1802680	I was thinking that too.
1802680	1805680	But Keith would not ever think that, so...
1805680	1806680	Why are you slowing down?
1806680	1808680	You say over the radio?
1808680	1809680	Yeah.
1809680	1814680	Oh, you know, that Carrie Page, that councilwoman, she lost that dog.
1814680	1817680	I just thought maybe it ran over here with all these other animals.
1817680	1819680	I don't know. Animals are weird. Maybe.
1819680	1821680	Let's keep going, though. I don't...
1821680	1822680	Yeah, I didn't see it up there.
1822680	1826680	I don't care about a councilwoman's dog. Probably the homeless people ate it, right?
1826680	1828680	Isn't that what she thought?
1828680	1829680	That's what she thought.
1829680	1832680	Yeah, that's what I think too. Maybe she should join the force, too.
1832680	1833680	Were they feeding dogs?
1833680	1834680	That's ridiculous.
1834680	1835680	Those homeless people you saw?
1835680	1836680	Nope.
1836680	1837680	That seems really prejudice.
1837680	1840680	I didn't like it when she said it. I don't like it when you say Keith.
1840680	1845680	Yeah, well, you weren't stuck on a bus full of stinky, scary people.
1845680	1846680	Who were not eating dogs.
1846680	1847680	At the time.
1847680	1849680	You guys pull up to the first church of contention.
1849680	1851680	It is one of the largest...
1854680	1857680	It's the fattest fucking building.
1857680	1858680	It's greasy as hell.
1858680	1860680	It's some weight, church.
1860680	1865680	It's one of the largest buildings in contention.
1865680	1874680	The entirety of the wall facing the street is made of enormous windows with a massive stained glass cross in its center.
1874680	1877680	The parking lot is the size of a football field.
1877680	1884680	And an electronic sign displays the time, temperature, and the hours of the different services.
1884680	1887680	It also currently has a slide that says in all caps,
1887680	1890680	Free meal for anyone who needs it.
1890680	1891680	Just come inside.
1892680	1898680	As you guys park in the parking lot, go ahead and roll an alertness check for me, John.
1900680	1902680	89 on a 60.
1902680	1904680	Okay, everything's good to go.
1904680	1905680	What do you guys want to do?
1905680	1908680	What temperature is up on that board?
1908680	1910680	48 degrees.
1910680	1915680	Okay, that was just a wild stab at the dark at the thing I was supposed to pass my alertness roll for.
1916680	1918680	I just think we just go in.
1918680	1920680	Yeah, everything seems fine to me.
1920680	1922680	Do we know what day it is?
1922680	1924680	It's December 4th.
1924680	1926680	Which is what day of the week?
1926680	1927680	It's Thursday.
1927680	1929680	We gotta get Ramona out of here.
1929680	1932680	Ramona wanted out. She was just like, I'm gone. You guys are nerds.
1933680	1935680	If that fucks up the...
1935680	1938680	I've never thought about it, but how about this?
1938680	1940680	That's a good question though, whether it's Sunday or not.
1940680	1942680	It started on Monday. How about that?
1942680	1945680	Monday night was when we started, and so Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
1945680	1947680	It's Thursday at noon.
1947680	1948680	Let's just go in.
1948680	1950680	There's no reason to call and ask.
1950680	1953680	We're here to confiscate a piece of evidence.
1953680	1955680	So yeah, that's what we're here for.
1955680	1957680	And it's a church. There's no way that they're gonna be...
1957680	1959680	How full is the parking lot?
1959680	1962680	There are a handful of cars in the parking lot.
1962680	1966680	There is also a motorcycle.
1966680	1970680	I'm gonna stay in the parking lot just in case.
1970680	1974680	Do you think I ought to stay behind just in case somebody tries to run outside or something?
1974680	1976680	I don't know why they would though.
1976680	1979680	Yeah, why don't you stay here and watch the cruisers?
1979680	1980680	Yeah, I will.
1980680	1983680	I'll sit in the cruiser and listen to NPR.
1983680	1987680	Actually, no. Keith would listen to the classic rock station.
1989680	1990680	Rock.
1993680	1995680	All right, Luke, leave.
1995680	1997680	Actually, it's the Doobie Brothers.
1997680	1998680	Oh, I have to leave?
1998680	1999680	I mean...
1999680	2000680	Or just come in with us.
2000680	2003680	Yeah, I'll go in. I don't wanna say that.
2004680	2006680	You know what? That's kind of realistic.
2006680	2009680	You don't wanna miss out on whatever's going on inside.
2009680	2010680	Yeah, go in with them.
2010680	2014680	Okay, cool. So when you guys walk through the front doors, the church is mostly empty.
2014680	2018680	But you can hear a rumble of noise coming from down the stairs.
2018680	2020680	Hey, do any of us go to this church?
2020680	2022680	I am not a religious man.
2022680	2024680	I don't think Clark is.
2024680	2025680	Maybe when he was a kid.
2025680	2027680	Yeah, I went here when I was a kid.
2027680	2028680	I think we probably all did.
2028680	2031680	So we know the layout of the church. We just haven't been in a while.
2031680	2036680	But we probably would have some relationship with the pastor as the only three cops in town, for sure.
2036680	2038680	Yeah, do we know just the pastor's name?
2038680	2040680	Yeah, his name is Adam Cain.
2040680	2041680	Adam Cain.
2041680	2043680	We probably do security for church events and shit.
2043680	2047680	Would I know where Pastor Cain's office is? Or is there maybe signage that would tell me?
2047680	2050680	Yeah, you could pretty easily find the offices.
2050680	2056680	I walk in and I unload my full clip screaming for Pastor Cain.
2058680	2059680	Yeah, I wanna go back into the offices.
2059680	2060680	Yeah, we'll follow him.
2060680	2068680	Okay, cool. Yeah, there is a door that says Head Pastor Adam Cain.
2068680	2070680	And the door is locked.
2070680	2071680	I knock on it.
2072680	2078680	Pastor, it's Clark here. Officer Bishop, we gotta talk to you.
2079680	2080680	I knock again.
2080680	2081680	You hear no response.
2081680	2084680	I'm gonna use my lock picking skill to pick the lock.
2084680	2086680	Keith pulls out his lock picks.
2086680	2087680	Wait, wait, wait.
2087680	2094680	While he does that, I go and try to find an administrative assistant or anybody who works here to ask where somebody is.
2094680	2096680	I did it already though. I got an 18 on a 50.
2098680	2104680	John, as you turn around to start walking through the church, you hear a click and the door opens.
2104680	2108680	I'm still gonna do what I was gonna do because we need to find the pastor.
2109680	2111680	The door clicks open. I immediately go inside.
2111680	2112680	Okay.
2113680	2115680	So, Clark, what are you doing?
2115680	2118680	I don't know. I think I'd probably peek in the door behind Keith.
2118680	2120680	Keith, what are you doing? Get out of there.
2120680	2121680	Dude.
2121680	2122680	It was locked.
2122680	2123680	I know. There's not any more.
2123680	2125680	Do you see the helmet in there?
2125680	2130680	I walk into the room and sitting on top of the, hold on.
2131680	2137680	John, you go walking through the church and you actually don't see anyone in the office.
2137680	2143680	There's a desk for a secretary, but she is or he is not sitting at the desk.
2143680	2149680	But you do hear that noise coming from, there's a large stairwell that goes downstairs.
2149680	2150680	And it sounds like there's-
2150680	2153680	And the lights are on down there and you can hear noise coming from down there.
2153680	2154680	I'm heading down there.
2154680	2155680	Sounds good.
2155680	2166680	Back in the office, Keith, you see sitting on the desk of the pastor, there is an old motorcycle helmet.
2166680	2171680	And it has some tubes on either side of it.
2171680	2178680	And there are two lights on it, one green, one red, and the red one is lit up.
2178680	2182680	I look at Clark and I go, yeah, baby.
2182680	2183680	And then I grab it.
2183680	2184680	No.
2184680	2190680	I grab it. I don't put it on, but I grab it and I am going to go outside and look at that motorcycle.
2190680	2192680	Wait, so when he grabbed it, did anything happen?
2192680	2196680	When you grabbed it, nothing happened, but then you turn around and Clark is-
2196680	2203680	Keith, we got one of these fucking radio, like switch people's bodies when, I assume when they touch it or something.
2203680	2215680	It's in my, I'm looking at you, like realizing that as you tell me it and it's in my hand, like, well, I just won't put it on, but it seems okay now.
2215680	2218680	The red lights on, remember the green lights, the one that-
2218680	2219680	Scary stuff happens.
2219680	2220680	Scary stuff happens.
2220680	2227680	Clark, Luke, Keith, do either one of you have microelectronics or-
2227680	2229680	I have computer science.
2229680	2232680	Microelectronics is not a thing.
2232680	2233680	Oh, it's not.
2233680	2235680	You don't have a craft skill or anything?
2235680	2236680	My craft is lock picking.
2236680	2237680	Okay.
2237680	2238680	I have 20 in computer science.
2238680	2241680	I've got a 50 in forensics.
2241680	2242680	Okay.
2242680	2243680	Then, yeah.
2243680	2244680	You guys are good?
2244680	2246680	Yeah, I don't have anything else that could even close.
2247680	2251680	Actually, instead of going out to check the motorcycle out-
2251680	2252680	Let's go find John.
2252680	2253680	Yeah, let's go see where John went.
2253680	2256680	I got the helmet and I'm carrying it like under my arm.
2256680	2257680	Sounds good.
2257680	2261680	John, you head down the stairs.
2261680	2270680	As you go down there, you see there's an extremely large room at the base of the stairs and there are a bunch of tables set up.
2270680	2274680	There is a long line of people.
2274680	2284680	Each person in line kind of looks down on their luck and the line leads to a serving window where there are a few people scooping pasta and salad onto paper plates.
2284680	2294680	And just past the food is Pastor Adam Cain and he is praying with each person who goes through the line when they grab their food.
2294680	2299680	He's doing a quick prayer with them and then they head to a table and start chowing down.
2299680	2303680	I take that all in and I stroll on up to the pastor.
2303680	2305680	You stroll up to the pastor, Adam Cain.
2305680	2308680	Adam Cain has a balloon-shaped head.
2308680	2315680	He has eyes that are so dark that the irises look black and he seems to be in his early 30s.
2315680	2318680	He is quite smooth and steady.
2318680	2328680	Everything he does seems to be deliberate and he's praying with each person who comes through and in between two people, you walk right up to him.
2328680	2329680	Good afternoon, pastor.
2329680	2331680	Oh, hello, officer.
2331680	2334680	What are y'all putting on today?
2334680	2336680	I mean, nothing in particular.
2336680	2342680	We're just doing our daily lunch service for anyone who is in need of a free meal.
2342680	2345680	Real quick, off out of character.
2345680	2350680	The homeless reports we had gotten, right, were about the homeless disappearing, right?
2350680	2352680	Or they were about the being a bunch of homeless?
2352680	2354680	An influx of homeless.
2354680	2355680	An influx of homeless.
2355680	2359680	You might be able to shed some light on something for me.
2359680	2365680	We've been hearing about an awful lot of homeless people coming into contention and you pray with these people.
2365680	2366680	You minister to them.
2366680	2368680	Have they been telling you where they're coming from?
2368680	2370680	What troubles have brought them here?
2370680	2378680	It seems to me that all of these new sheep into the herd of God's kingdom have come from the city.
2378680	2383680	They all are down on their luck and I am here to feed them.
2383680	2385680	Well, that's very Christian of you, pastor.
2385680	2388680	I do what I think is the right thing.
2388680	2390680	Hey, you know, the reason I'm here today.
2390680	2393680	We've been dealing with some things going on in this town.
2393680	2395680	Some stuff is coming together.
2395680	2404680	We had a pretty important ongoing investigation and unfortunately, eh, this is gonna just sound strange, but...
2404680	2411680	To the right of you, there are a lot of homeless people piling up who each have their plates waiting for a prayer with Pastor Adam Cain.
2411680	2417680	Um, I kinda, I am like sideways and I'm like, alright, alright, give me a minute with the pastor.
2417680	2420680	Ain't got a fucking monopoly on salvation, you homeless fucks.
2423680	2424680	I say that all into my breath.
2424680	2425680	Sorry, pastor.
2425680	2427680	Here's the long and short of it.
2427680	2433680	We heard that the church had purchased a helmet from a flea market, a motorcycle helmet.
2433680	2439680	That is unfortunately related to an investigation we are conducting right now.
2439680	2441680	Should have never been on sale. Let's just put it that way.
2441680	2444680	So we're gonna need to take that in for evidence if y'all still have it.
2444680	2449680	Uh, yes. It's actually up in my office right now.
2449680	2454680	I know you got a whole lot of praying and blessing to do, but would you mind taking me up there right now?
2454680	2455680	Absolutely not.
2455680	2461680	Everyone, I'm so sorry. I will be back in a flickscrow of a switch.
2461680	2462680	Y'all, y'all stay blessed now.
2462680	2469680	And the two of you begin walking up to the stairs right as Keith and Clark come walking down the stairs,
2469680	2473680	Keith holding the helmet underneath one of his arms.
2473680	2476680	And as you all approach each other...
2476680	2479680	Hey, I found the pastor. He's gonna let us in to his office.
2480680	2481680	Why?
2484680	2489680	Oh, uh, pastor, your office was open back there. We found the helmet we needed.
2489680	2495680	Yeah, the door was wide open and I saw the helmet and I figured, you know, I might as well grab it now,
2495680	2501680	um, save you the trouble from having to go back up there and then we'd come tell you that we got it and head on our way.
2501680	2506680	Yeah, pastor, that's all proper procedure and not Vigna being reckless.
2506680	2507680	Yeah, I mean...
2507680	2508680	That's correct. That's...
2508680	2510680	There's no reason for you to, yeah.
2510680	2514680	Uh, Keith, if you could roll persuade for me against his humit.
2516680	2517680	Oh.
2517680	2518680	Fuck.
2518680	2520680	Oh, fuck no.
2520680	2521680	That's a hundow.
2521680	2524680	He rolled a hundred. The worst of the worst.
2524680	2531680	You rolled a hundred and the pastor passed his check and he looks at you and he says,
2531680	2540680	That's quite alright. I'm always willing to comply with anything that the enforcers of the law of this great country can do for us.
2540680	2542680	So is that all you need?
2542680	2544680	What attracted you to the helmet?
2544680	2545680	Why'd you buy that?
2545680	2546680	What kind of food?
2546680	2547680	What am I smelling down there?
2548680	2552680	Look, you can just go look at that. We're trying to ask real questions. It's pasta, you eat.
2552680	2556680	He's right, okay. I'm gonna kind of squeeze past everybody. I'm super embarrassed.
2556680	2560680	Uh, squeeze past everybody, go grab a plate of whatever's down there.
2560680	2564680	I'm sticking with John and the pastor. Keith, are you holding on to the helmet as you...
2564680	2565680	Oh, yeah, definitely.
2565680	2573680	Yep, so as you pass through, Pastor Adam Kane kind of looks at John and Clark. Was there anything else?
2573680	2575680	Yeah, I just asked you a question.
2575680	2580680	Oh, I'm sorry. I was taken aback by Officer Vigna's actions.
2580680	2583680	He hadn't eaten for like 30 minutes, so he was...
2583680	2584680	He only had his daily flow.
2584680	2587680	Well, he's gotta fit into those pants somehow, I suppose.
2587680	2589680	He's trying, you know. He's trying.
2589680	2591680	So what was the question that you asked me?
2591680	2592680	Why did you purchase that helmet?
2592680	2599680	Oh, I was in the market for a helmet after I decided to go out and buy a motorcycle.
2599680	2600680	Have you ever ridden one?
2600680	2601680	Oh, is that your bike out there?
2601680	2602680	Yes.
2602680	2604680	I'm acquainted with speed, Pastor.
2604680	2607680	Is it not just the most exhilarating?
2607680	2608680	Heavenly.
2608680	2609680	It's wonderful.
2609680	2612680	I find them dangerous and reckless, but to each their own.
2612680	2616680	I appreciate that, but when you have God on your side, nothing is reckless.
2616680	2619680	And you got a helmet. Well, you don't have a helmet anymore, but...
2619680	2623680	I did have a helmet, and you said you will be taking that?
2623680	2629680	We are gonna have to take a little bit of a look at it. You should get it back in 12 to 32 weeks.
2629680	2633680	Oh, gosh, I really thought you were gonna say hours. Okay, I will...
2633680	2634680	You should buy a new helmet.
2634680	2637680	Then I suppose I am once again in the market for a helmet.
2637680	2641680	Hey, I hate to do this to you, but we see you riding without one.
2641680	2645680	We are gonna have to give you a ticket, so you should probably get that taken care of immediately.
2645680	2646680	Well, I will indeed.
2646680	2652680	I'll have you know that I am working on legislation to have that particular law removed.
2652680	2657680	There's nothing like riding a motorcycle with the wind in your hair, am I right, John?
2657680	2659680	Sorry, Officer Pettymore.
2659680	2660680	Thank you, Pastor.
2660680	2663680	Thank you, Pastor. Now, I have to say I disagree there.
2663680	2667680	You know, Clark's right, these are dangerous machines.
2667680	2675680	It frankly seems irresponsible of somebody, you know, who has his own flock to be introducing this kind of legislation to the community.
2675680	2680680	Well, I certainly don't believe that there's anything un-Christian about such legislation.
2680680	2684680	Oh, well. Feels like you'd be leading directly to deaths. I don't know.
2684680	2688680	Pastor, you think that people shouldn't wear helmets on motorcycles?
2688680	2690680	That is my goal, yes.
2690680	2697680	Hell, man, that makes you the coolest pastor I know, but that is not responsible.
2697680	2698680	To each their own, I suppose.
2698680	2700680	That seems like the definition of reckless.
2700680	2707680	Yeah, your recklessness is gonna lead to a lot of wrecks, and folks is gonna be cracking their heads open, because they ain't got no helmet.
2707680	2713680	I personally don't understand the correlation between a lack of helmet and an influx of wrecks.
2713680	2715680	We're talking about the severity of the accident?
2715680	2718680	Okay, I'm sorry. I misunderstood you then, I suppose.
2718680	2728680	Pastor, I just gotta advise you completely against submitting this, like, this doesn't seem like it would be good for your reputation, for the advancement of our plot in particular, or...
2728680	2730680	To each their own, I suppose.
2730680	2733680	That's not the law yet, so you do need that helmet.
2733680	2741680	Absolutely. I guess I'm in the market again, and I tend to buy used, so I will be back at Forgotten Treasures soon, I suppose.
2742680	2748680	Okay, also though, you should definitely get a new one, because they don't last if they've been in a crash or something.
2748680	2752680	Well, I always get my helmet facts on all the used helmets that I buy.
2752680	2757680	What did the helmet facts say on this one? I guess you could just tell the tubes weren't broken, so that's a good...
2757680	2760680	There's glass on the outside of it, so I assume...
2760680	2762680	It's like a rudimentary quality assurance.
2762680	2770680	Absolutely. I thought it was quite clever of the original makers, although I didn't find a name on it, interestingly enough.
2770680	2772680	Have you seen what these lights do?
2772680	2774680	I'm sorry, lights?
2774680	2776680	Yeah, the red and green light.
2776680	2777680	Oh, yeah, it's just...
2777680	2779680	You ever seen that green light come on?
2779680	2780680	No, it's just been red.
2780680	2781680	Okay.
2781680	2783680	How many times have you used the helmet since you bought it?
2783680	2787680	I picked up the motorcycle, and I rode it here.
2787680	2788680	So once?
2788680	2789680	I suppose so, yes.
2789680	2790680	When was that?
2790680	2796680	Well, it's, you know, there was, you know, some weather conflicts, and I stayed home one day, and...
2796680	2797680	Oh, okay.
2797680	2801680	I've only gotten to ride it once, but it was quite thrilling.
2801680	2806680	Hey, Pastor, what does the Bible say about animals congregating in funny ways in streams, or creeks?
2806680	2808680	You have noticed that is...
2808680	2811680	Well, I have thought that was quite strange.
2811680	2814680	That's all the spiritual guidance you got for us there that's quite strange?
2814680	2815680	Well, I've been praying about it.
2815680	2816680	How long has it been going on?
2816680	2818680	Oh, a couple days.
2818680	2819680	They've been out there?
2819680	2823680	Seems rather odd. Do you see them come and go, or have they just been staying there?
2823680	2826680	Well, some of them run through the water, and that's always a joy.
2826680	2831680	You know, it's not every day that you get to see a mink and a raccoon interact.
2831680	2833680	Yeah, for sure. No, I mean, thank God for all these creatures.
2833680	2835680	They give us company and nutrition.
2835680	2839680	I come back up, I got a plate full of all the...
2839680	2840680	Pasta and salad.
2840680	2844680	Pasta and salad that I could fit on there, and I've got a mouthful of food,
2844680	2848680	but I shoot up and swallow it, and I come up to the pastor, and I say,
2848680	2851680	Hey, do you know where all these people are staying?
2851680	2853680	I believe they live in the city.
2853680	2855680	All these homeless people live in the city?
2855680	2858680	Well, there are more shelters there than there are here,
2858680	2864680	and I believe from talking to them, they seem to be moving from shelter to shelter,
2864680	2866680	depending on which days are available.
2866680	2868680	Do you know the plight of the homeless well, Keith?
2868680	2870680	Sorry, Officer Vigna?
2870680	2871680	Thank you.
2871680	2873680	I... I just...
2873680	2874680	I have a...
2874680	2879680	This might sound like an odd question, but do the pistons attend your congregation?
2879680	2881680	Yeah...
2881680	2883680	Well...
2883680	2887680	I can't say that there are regulars here at the First Church of Contention,
2887680	2890680	though I do see George and Kathy,
2890680	2894680	and they'll sometimes bring Leo on holidays here and there.
2894680	2896680	When's the last time you saw them here?
2896680	2897680	Oh, gosh.
2897680	2900680	Might have been our Fourth of July celebration, I don't know.
2900680	2901680	It could have been Easter.
2901680	2902680	Okay.
2902680	2905680	Were you aware they might be running a...
2905680	2906680	A homeless shelter?
2906680	2907680	Shooting daggers at...
2907680	2909680	Yeah, we're both shooting daggers at Keith.
2909680	2910680	With their eyes.
2910680	2911680	Yeah, I...
2911680	2912680	No.
2912680	2913680	I say no.
2913680	2915680	We're firing daggers out of our service business.
2915680	2917680	Roll mail.
2917680	2918680	Yeah, I say...
2918680	2919680	He's not...
2919680	2920680	He's running...
2920680	2921680	Yeah, he's not running.
2921680	2923680	Did you know that the pistons are running a pig farm?
2923680	2924680	Well, yes.
2924680	2926680	That has been their business for some time.
2926680	2927680	All right.
2927680	2928680	I just wanted to check.
2928680	2929680	Hey, Keith...
2929680	2930680	I'm pulling this.
2930680	2931680	Keith, what the...
2931680	2934680	We don't fucking just tell people about facts about the investigation, God dammit.
2934680	2935680	So, Pastor...
2935680	2938680	I do need to get back to my flock.
2938680	2939680	If that's all that you need, then...
2939680	2940680	Of course.
2940680	2942680	You got a lot of blessing and praying to do.
2942680	2943680	I am...
2943680	2945680	Thank you so much for understanding about the helmet.
2945680	2948680	Hey, if you remember anything about that, why don't you give us a call?
2948680	2949680	Here's my card.
2949680	2953680	Hey, real fast, before you go, did anybody else come asking about this helmet?
2953680	2956680	You are the first ones I've talked to about it.
2956680	2957680	All right.
2957680	2958680	Can I humint that?
2958680	2959680	Oh, yes, you can.
2959680	2960680	Roll humint.
2960680	2962680	93 out of 50.
2962680	2963680	Fail.
2963680	2964680	All right.
2964680	2969040	I take a few more bites of my food and then I go back to the buffet and I scrape the leftovers
2969040	2970040	back into their...
2970040	2971040	Oh, my God.
2971040	2972040	Back into their...
2972040	2974680	Like the salad, back into the salad, and the pasta, back into the pasta.
2974680	2978080	How do you think real people...
2978080	2982680	How do you think your coworkers are actually supposed to react to that?
2982680	2989680	If you saw somebody do that that you knew, you would hate that person.
2989680	2993340	Vigna, what the fuck?
2993340	2998060	Get those trays, throw those out, help the kitchen workers bring some new ones back.
2998060	3000380	What the hell are you doing in this church?
3000380	3002340	Do you hate homeless people?
3002340	3003340	I was just trying to...
3003340	3004340	I didn't need it anymore.
3004340	3005340	Vigna.
3005340	3006340	And they need it more than me.
3006340	3007340	Let's get out of here.
3007340	3008520	Vigna, you dumb son of a bitch.
3008520	3015120	You guys are yelling this weird conversation on one side of the room as Pastor Adam Kane
3015120	3022420	is just staring daggers into both of you as he circles around and gets to the front of
3022420	3028180	the group, grabs a microphone, and begins speaking.
3028180	3032340	Hello everyone, and welcome to the First Church of Contention.
3032340	3035260	I am the pastor, Adam Kane.
3035260	3036700	You guys are having this weird conversation.
3036700	3041420	Clark, I imagine you still standing on the stairs looking into this room.
3041420	3043060	And the pastor goes on.
3043060	3047920	We here at FCC believe that every life has a purpose.
3047920	3054200	No one comes through our doors by accident, and we aim to help alleviate any pain in any
3054200	3057000	life, in any way possible.
3057000	3060580	Today that pain may be physical hunger.
3060580	3062160	We can help with that.
3062160	3065500	Let's all give a round of applause to our wonderful volunteers from the youth group
3065500	3070240	serving up the pasta that my beautiful wife Evelyn and our kids David and Sarah have made.
3070240	3071240	Well done.
3071240	3077880	Now please enjoy the food and the fellowship, and we hope to see you back with us on Sunday.
3077920	3081040	So that we may relieve your spiritual pain.
3081040	3084880	You know, a beautiful afterlife awaits everyone who believes.
3084880	3088000	It is just on the other side of the veil, and...
3088000	3091400	Look at me, I'm getting ahead of myself.
3091400	3095360	Enjoy yourselves, and we'll see you all on Sunday.
3095360	3098520	And he clicks the mic off and goes back walking through.
3098520	3104200	In a little bit of time dilation, as he was doing all that, can I scan the crowd?
3104200	3106600	Is the crowd reacting like a normal crowd would?
3106600	3107600	Absolutely, yeah, yeah.
3107920	3112160	Have you ever seen, have you ever been to like a soup kitchen or a church when they're
3112160	3113880	serving a group of homeless people?
3113880	3115440	No, I guess not, not homeless people.
3115440	3117800	I've been to like churches serving dinners, but...
3117800	3120480	It is weirdly quiet.
3120480	3121480	So Keith?
3121480	3125160	Yeah, I head back up the stairs, I'm like, I don't want to be here anymore.
3125160	3129600	I do want to go look at this guy's bike, just to check it out, because I got this cool helmet.
3129600	3134680	I've never ridden a motorcycle before, but all of a sudden I feel like, damn, this is cool.
3134680	3135880	It's a pretty sweet motorcycle.
3135880	3136880	Is it black?
3136880	3147120	Yes, and it's pretty, it's got a naked lady on the gas tank.
3147120	3149920	This pastor's a really cool pastor.
3149920	3153920	It's Mary Magdalene.
3153920	3155920	Bathing Jesus's feet.
3155920	3159080	With her hair, pin-up style Mary.
3159080	3161040	I would rise up for three days for that.
3166880	3190960	How am I the only one trying to pull over How can you have enough drowning out of the
3190960	3191960	night?
3191960	3192960	No, I'm not.
3192960	3192960
