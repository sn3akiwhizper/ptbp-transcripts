0	7820	Good morning my babies, it's everybody's favorite radio DJing contention wolf the dog and we
7820	16020	are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP today with a little news for y'all.
16020	20700	Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and let me tell y'all she is pissed about
20700	23960	it she is not happy at all.
23960	32080	Jimmy sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on those sweet sweet good mushrooms.
32080	37280	And Mildred Mitchell that old cookie pot head saw a bright flash of light from across the
37280	42020	street in John Peters house and now speaking of that old boy wouldn't you know it John
42020	46680	Peters is missing heard he had a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago poor guy
46680	48840	can't catch a break.
48840	53880	And two people came to John Peters house packed a drunken to their white Toyota and took off
53880	60200	coming in hot off the presses we got a new song for y'all it's No Backbone by Kudzu.
83880	95440	Remember when my knee was up this morning and you kept saying that it was my boner?
95440	96440	That was funny.
96440	101260	Luke was on the couch like prone right and his knee was just like right in the middle
101260	105880	of his body sticking straight up and it looked like his dick was like a uh.
105880	112280	As big as it is if not smaller.
112280	113680	What happened last time Zach?
113680	119680	Last time you guys were standing at John Peters house and uh you just reviewed Keith Vigna's
119680	120680	excellent policing.
120680	121680	Yeah you're welcome for that.
121680	126440	If I remember it seemed like a really anticlimactic place to end an episode.
126440	127440	Yeah yeah yeah.
127440	130480	Because I didn't do any I didn't have a climax.
130480	136860	You had figured out that Mildred Mitchell drives a white car.
136860	138960	Is this a goddamn logic problem?
138960	144000	Mildred Mitchell drives a white car but John Peters will never eat ham.
144000	146240	John Peters drives a maroon car.
146240	151400	We decided it was something like a Cutlass Supreme or a La Sabre or it could be a Honda
151400	152400	Civic.
152400	157240	And the car that came picked up the trunk and also drove off with John Peters car were
157240	160480	two men in a white Toyota.
160480	161480	Fucking exotic dude.
161480	163600	You ever been to Japan?
163600	166080	It might it might be exotic for contention.
166080	167320	What did the trunk say?
167320	169640	Do not open if you want to live.
169640	170640	Correct?
170640	171640	Yes.
171640	175840	Or conversely it said open if you want to die.
175840	177280	That was just implied.
177280	179720	It's about 2pm on December 2nd.
179720	181580	Today's actually January 1st.
181580	182580	But um chuh dude.
182580	183580	Happy New Year.
183580	186280	I had a great time last night.
186280	187280	Me too.
187280	193120	I repeatedly told you that I loved you a lot and it still rings true today.
193120	194680	We'll see about tomorrow but.
194680	195680	I wish you'd been there.
195680	196680	Me too.
197040	198040	I was sleepy.
198040	199040	Hahaha.
199040	200040	Dude wait here.
200040	201040	Can you do this?
201040	207840	For the listeners, Thomas and Luke are drying up their top lip and the gums above their
207840	208840	front teeth.
208840	211400	Joe just like moved his lip a little bit and was doing it.
211400	212400	Pretty much there.
212400	213720	It's kind of my face.
213720	215440	He had that dry vape mouth.
215440	218640	You got a real wet mouth so I got to dry mine off.
218640	219640	I got weird teeth.
219640	223800	The best way to do it is like to not have to move your muscles in your lip and just
223800	226040	have it hang on there because of how dry it is.
226400	229680	Do we really know that it's a white Toyota that went blazing by?
229680	230680	Yeah we found that out.
230680	231680	That the men came in.
231680	232680	Not for sure.
232680	233680	That's what Mildred told you.
233680	236040	I don't think we can put out an APB for a white Toyota.
236040	239000	Yeah also we didn't.
239000	241040	Wait were they in a white Toyota?
241040	243920	Cause she drives a white car right?
243920	244920	Yep.
244920	245920	And they were in a white Toyota.
245920	246920	Yep.
246920	247920	I think this is a dead end guys.
247920	248920	Wait hold on.
248920	251340	Is this a cool like knocking on the door sound?
251340	252340	Hold on.
252340	253340	No.
253340	256220	It's like a really weird hollow metal door.
256220	257220	Yeah it is.
257220	258220	Okay let's go.
258220	259220	Set the scene.
259220	265020	The three of you are standing in the midst of Keith Vigna's excellent police work and
265020	271780	Mildred Mitchell is headed back across the street to her home which has her white car
271780	272780	in the driveway.
272780	278300	There's a black car in her driveway as well since we're just talking colors of cars.
278300	280260	I drive a silver car.
280260	282020	That's a police work that I do.
282020	284860	What color is your car?
284860	288740	Got it.
288740	292280	Radical new direction for the podcast.
292280	293280	What color is your car?
293280	294280	What color is your car?
294280	296020	Are we in the house or out of the house right now?
296020	298500	I think you are standing in the house of John.
298500	301460	Can I roll a search roll just to do.
301460	303380	I think you already crit succeeded right?
303380	307200	Well I yeah I crit succeeded but I also want to do just one more just because I feel so
307200	311760	bad about how shitty I did this first that first time around where.
311760	313080	You're like seeing their faces.
313080	316680	I think that's a really good direction for your character to go.
316680	321100	I really want to redeem myself on this like shoddy police work that I've done and I want
321100	325480	to like try to find something now and be like oh yeah I remember that.
325480	329720	You like see the faces of your fellow police officers and want to work even harder.
329720	332040	Tell me if it's good or not, 21?
332040	336840	You look around the house you see that the trunk is no longer there and the picture frames
336840	344000	that you saw earlier are cleaned up, the bedding stubs are still there, bottles are still around.
344000	347800	The people who were clearly here did not drop anything.
347800	351000	I want to look at the pictures real fast are they anything interesting?
351000	352120	Picture the family right?
352120	357840	Yeah basically it's just pictures of him and like maybe some friends from college.
357840	364160	He obviously doesn't have like a nuclear family he has like cousins and friends.
364160	366400	But they were broken before and now they're all cleaned up?
366400	370640	They would probably want to move them in order to have a clear path.
370640	373320	So obviously he did not come back to the house.
373320	377200	So we got to figure out who was in that white Toyota.
377200	380280	Who do we know who drives a white Toyota?
380280	386000	You guys would also be dealing with the fact that there was a dead body out in the junkyard
386000	387000	last night?
387000	388000	That's true.
388000	391160	I think this is not a huge concern for us right now honestly.
391160	394840	Frankly all that seems secondary to the city councilor stuff.
394840	401800	I just wonder if we were real police officers we wouldn't just be like oh well.
401800	403880	Like how would we wrap this up as far as a case goes?
403880	408080	I don't know I feel like if there's three of us on the force and a murder just happened
408080	410340	this is not gonna be in our mind.
410340	415720	This is only important because we're playing a mystery podcast.
415720	421480	You guys literally went to a like drunk fueled site that didn't exist and you went to talk
421480	423860	to a council person about their dog.
423860	428100	The hardest lead we have right now towards the big mystery is the dogs.
428100	434100	What I'm really concerned about now is I made the chief cry with a gift that I didn't actually
434100	435760	get her that I said was mine.
435760	438500	And I'm really concerned about finding out where she is.
438500	439820	You wanna go hit up that chief?
439820	441820	That is probably the most pressing mystery.
441820	444900	We all drive all three of our cop cars back to the station.
444900	448300	Did I lay out too many mysteries right off the top?
448300	452300	No we're just bad.
452300	454620	I think it's good leads to more.
454620	456980	You just gotta focus our energy on...
456980	462420	Okay let me get an intelligence check from whoever has the highest intelligence.
462420	463420	I got 50.
463420	464420	75?
464420	465420	55.
465420	466420	Yes.
466420	470860	You do have the dead body and you basically have one lead from that.
470860	474100	Which is the woman who called and then crashed your car.
474100	476260	Have we heard back from the coroner on...
476260	477260	Yes.
477260	479260	She had the brand on her back that said this is a fool.
479260	480260	Oh that's right.
480260	481260	Would I know this?
481260	489060	The brand that she had on her back was that in like the same size or font that the do
489060	492740	not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk.
492740	494660	You haven't seen a picture of the back.
494660	499820	Hey do you guys have a picture of the back that I could see?
499820	501980	He says to the wind.
501980	504260	Hey uh...
504260	508580	We all look at Keith.
508580	509580	What?
510180	511180	She was...
511180	515140	This just popped up in my mind because I'm a good detective.
515140	516140	He says confidently.
516140	517900	I'm a good detective.
517900	523220	So what I just thought that neither of you did, which proves how good of a detective
523220	525480	I am.
525480	532520	So the do not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk and that lady had that
532520	533980	brand in her back.
533980	538860	Yeah so I'd like to see a picture of the text on her back.
539300	541100	We can just have the coroner send that over.
541100	542460	Yeah what do you guys want to do next?
542460	546200	I think we maybe are interested in what's going on with the chief.
546200	548300	So I would call her real quick first.
548300	551160	Okay so you left John Peters house in what state?
551160	552160	I closed.
552160	555820	It seems like Keith did his due diligence so.
555820	557420	We closed the door this time.
557420	558420	And then just bailed.
558420	559420	And we leave.
559420	560420	Alright cool.
560420	562320	So you guys are back at the police station.
562320	567260	You let Drew know that you want to get a hold of county and get a picture of the back of
567260	568660	the body that was found out in the junkyard.
568660	572420	Honestly I'd like to have all the pictures that the coroner took just for posterity.
572420	573420	Sure.
573420	574420	Perfect absolutely.
574420	579100	So none of this in the box that we gave her made any sense to you?
579100	580260	I didn't recognize any of it.
580260	586140	It seemed like it might be symbolic of some sort of stratification in the city or perhaps
586140	587140	amongst the cult.
587140	591780	I panicked when that box was there and I said yeah I gave that to you.
591780	594340	Didn't know that it would make her react that way so.
594340	597620	I asked Drew so you didn't see anybody drop off that box?
597620	598620	No.
598620	599980	I called the chief.
599980	601620	Okay on her cell phone.
601620	603140	It goes straight to voicemail.
603140	605220	In my seventeen years with her.
605220	606220	This has never happened.
606220	607220	Not even remotely?
607220	608220	Not even close.
608220	609380	Okay so I'm a little maybe worried.
609380	610380	I would be.
610380	614140	Guys I think I'm going to go head over to the chiefs house just check on her.
614140	615900	She's never missed a day of work like this before.
615900	619780	Can I ride along with you I just I feel really really really bad.
619780	620780	Yeah sure.
620780	622420	I just want to apologize when we see her.
622420	624100	John Lee what are you thinking?
624100	625220	A man of few words.
625220	627500	Which ones do you want to use to describe your actions?
627500	628500	Tag.
628500	629500	Tag along.
629500	630500	Are you going to come with?
630500	631500	Yeah.
631500	632500	Might as well.
632500	633500	Shotgun.
633500	634500	We do that.
634500	635500	Okay you guys head over to the chiefs house.
635500	639940	The chief lives in the old neighborhood right by beans pond.
639940	641020	She has.
641020	642020	A nice old house.
642020	643020	Is that the northwest?
643020	644020	Is that beans pond?
644020	646020	No this is just southwest of downtown.
646020	651680	Where is the chiefs house in relation to John Peters and also Kerry pages?
651680	659620	The chief lives a few blocks northeast of John Peters and Mildred Mitchell and just
659620	662720	east of pages Kerry pages.
662720	665080	So they're all like within blocks of each other?
665080	666080	Oh yeah.
666080	667080	Cool.
667080	668080	Yep yep yep yep yep.
668080	672160	So you go to the chiefs house and her cruiser is not out front.
672160	677380	Does she drive her cruiser as her personal vehicle or does she have a personal vehicle?
677380	680000	I think she probably has a truck.
680000	681000	Like a F-150.
681480	683760	Can I do a search roll for the chief?
683760	688480	Yeah go for it.
688480	690520	He doesn't do a search roll for the chief.
690520	692920	Eighty four on a fitty.
692920	693920	You don't find her.
693920	694920	Oh darn.
694920	695920	Hey guys.
695920	696920	Guys I've really tried my best here.
696920	699020	Is her truck in the driveway?
699020	700560	You would know.
700560	701920	I think you've known her for a long time.
701920	703520	Her truck is in the garage typically.
703520	705720	I'm going to go and knock on the door.
705720	707120	Okay there's no response.
707120	708680	I look in the windows.
708680	713200	There is probably just like one window up front that you can see through the curtains
713200	714800	a little bit and you can't see it.
714800	716640	Could you describe her house to me?
716640	717640	It's nice.
717640	719960	Like are we?
719960	720960	Thank you for that.
720960	722760	This is a range style house.
722760	727120	It's got a nice little front patio area with a bench on it.
727120	728120	Nice.
728120	729120	Nice.
729120	730120	Made a note.
730120	731120	Cool.
731120	732120	Rick?
732120	733120	Uh yeah.
733120	734120	Of course.
734120	737120	What did it, what was my looking in the windows?
737120	738120	What did that?
738560	739560	See it's dark in there.
739560	740560	There's no movement.
740560	741560	I tried the handle.
741560	742560	See if it's open.
742560	743560	It's not.
743560	744560	It's locked.
744560	747880	I'm going to swing around back guys and see if the back door is open because I feel so
747880	752640	bad about making her storm off and I just, I need to apologize and this seems a little
752640	753640	fishy.
753640	754640	I don't know.
754640	755640	Go check it.
755640	756640	So I'm going to, yeah.
756640	759740	She's got a gate on her privacy fence that doesn't have a lock on it so you just go into
759740	764780	her backyard and as you're walking through her backyard you can see in her back windows
764780	765920	and the lights are off.
765920	766920	Nobody's home.
766920	767920	I'm going to check the back door.
768720	769720	Absolutely.
769720	770720	Yeah.
770720	771720	Hold on just a second.
771720	773480	I'm going to do a roll for her real quick.
773480	774800	That's a spoiler that she is alive.
774800	775800	Oh yeah.
775800	776800	No, no, no.
776800	777800	Everything's locked up nice and tight.
777800	778800	Everything's locked up.
778800	779800	Okay.
779800	780800	Yep.
780800	781800	Well I swing back around front and uh.
781800	785780	Uh you guys think we should uh go and check on uh at Klinker's?
785780	787280	Does she hang out at Klinker's?
787280	788440	That's where she does her drinking.
788440	790280	I didn't, well the more you know.
790280	791860	I didn't see her there last night.
791860	794420	Let's go check and just see if, was it Harry Klinker?
794420	795420	Who's the guy that runs that place?
795420	796420	You know Harry.
796420	797420	I don't know Harry.
797920	798920	I don't know anybody in this town.
798920	799920	It's a few boys.
799920	802420	Let's go to Klinker's and check out and see if anybody saw her.
802420	807740	If not, you know, I think between the three of us we can handle this murder mystery.
807740	811460	We don't need the chief, but I'd love to apologize to her.
811460	813700	Her steady guidance would be appreciated.
813700	815900	So yeah, we head over to Klinker's.
815900	817300	Okay, you walk into Klinker's.
817300	820620	Klinker's is like a small shitty dive bar.
820620	823760	When you walk in, there's cigarette smoke hanging in the air.
823760	825000	There's three tables.
825000	827340	There's a pool table and a bar.
827340	831500	There's a couple of regulars in there and Harry, the owner and bartender is back behind
831500	832500	the bar.
832500	837340	He is a tall older man with turkey neck and bad teeth.
837340	839540	Yo turkey neck.
839540	843860	You stand under your breath as you walk in.
843860	845820	What did Harry do to you?
845820	846820	Dick?
846820	851100	I bet, like honestly, I bet Harry would be pretty anxious to see all three cops in town
851100	852620	walk into his establishment.
852620	854560	Absolutely he would be.
854560	855560	Can we establish this?
856280	857280	Do you know this guy?
857280	858280	Probably.
858280	859280	Yeah.
859280	860280	I think we all do.
860280	861280	I don't.
861280	862280	I'm playing the new kid in town.
862280	863280	I know, but you've been here for a few months.
863280	864280	You probably at least.
864280	865480	Wait, you are from here, right?
865480	869160	I'm from here, like elementary school, moved to the city.
869160	872240	Harry Klinker babysat every child.
872240	873240	Yeah.
873240	874240	He was my babysitter.
874240	875760	Did your mama never drop you off at Klinker's?
875760	877800	Oh, I forgot to mention there is a-
877800	878800	There's a baby seat.
878800	883280	You see, there's a doorway in the back right of the bar and it's got one of those baby
883280	888640	gates on it and there are three toddlers standing over the edge trying to crawl over.
888640	889640	No one's watching.
889640	890640	Harry?
890640	891640	We have some questions for you.
891640	892640	Hey, Harry.
892640	893640	Well, hey, question.
893640	894640	Have you seen the chief?
894640	897640	Not in a couple of days.
897640	898640	All right.
898640	899640	Thanks.
899640	900640	And we head out.
900640	901640	Bye, Harry.
901640	902640	Bye, Harry.
902640	903640	See you tonight.
903640	904980	That was Harry.
904980	908880	As we walk out, I'm a little bit shaken.
908880	911520	Did a bunch of memories from your childhood just come rushing back?
911560	915040	I pull out my pack of cigarettes that you guys have never seen me smoke.
915040	916760	Is this how you're going to vape on?
916760	918760	No, no, no, no.
918760	923640	I go, I just had some weird thoughts from my childhood come in.
923640	927960	I spent more time at Klinker's when I was a kid than I have since I've lived here.
927960	929800	Harry's like a second father to us all.
929800	930800	Yeah.
930800	931800	Oh, hey.
931800	933800	You came outside, Harry?
933800	934800	Yeah.
934800	936120	He's been following you.
936120	939280	He steps outside for a smoke.
939280	941100	Nice fresh air.
941100	944100	Harry, was Keith a picky eater?
944100	947280	I like hot dog sandwiches.
947280	948580	The city has changed you.
948580	954180	You cut up those hot dogs that boy eat them up real quick on some white bread.
954180	956300	Well, that doesn't really answer the question.
956300	961220	Can't really say we offered him much else.
961220	963220	So in your experience, no.
963220	966060	He's the pickiest eater I've ever seen.
966060	969500	He would only eat hot dogs cut up on white bread.
969500	970500	What are you guys doing?
970900	972300	Uh, where are we going?
972300	973300	Great question.
973300	974300	Okay.
974300	976080	What's, what's the hottest lead we got?
976080	978900	So I ran the body's prints and hair.
978900	979900	Got nothing back.
979900	980900	Yeah.
980900	981900	Took the body to the corner.
981900	982900	I guess we could run.
982900	985380	Have I, have I seen, have I seen those pictures from Ju yet?
985380	986380	Oh, uh, yeah.
986380	987820	Drew will send them on over.
987820	990260	Oh, go ahead and roll a sanity check for me.
990260	991260	No.
991260	992260	93.
992260	993260	Okay.
993260	994260	Yeah.
994260	997740	You're going to lose one sanity as you see this brutal act shown out on this, uh, this
997740	999300	woman's back.
999300	1002940	The skin is blistered and boiled around each letter.
1002940	1006620	And instead of looking at the picture, I take his word for it.
1006620	1007740	Smart.
1007740	1013380	Did the corner and doing the autopsy of the body do anything more to identify it than
1013380	1014380	we did?
1014380	1015380	Would they have done anything like that?
1015380	1020300	The report came back with a bunch of odd results, so they're going to run them again to double
1020300	1021300	check some stuff.
1021300	1022300	They're not sure what's going on.
1022300	1023300	Okay.
1023300	1026260	And then also the Julie gal who crashed her car.
1026260	1027260	Yeah.
1027260	1028260	Julie Maxwell.
1028260	1029260	Rest in peace.
1029260	1030220	Yeah.
1030220	1032700	They called and said that she was pronounced dead last night.
1032700	1034740	We should maybe do some investigation on her.
1034740	1039380	We should probably get, uh, have the coroner look at her and give us some information.
1039380	1040380	Some kind of inquest.
1040380	1044220	Cause this is a, this is my main person of interest.
1044220	1047620	John, when you searched her car, did you get identification?
1047620	1048620	Yes.
1048620	1049620	Let's look into that.
1049620	1050620	Let's see if she's, let's run her name.
1050620	1051620	See if she's on casenet.
1051620	1052620	Yeah.
1052620	1053620	Right.
1053620	1057380	You want to just run her info in the database and maybe even Facebook or just like see if
1057380	1058740	you get any background on her.
1058740	1059740	Okay.
1059740	1060740	Sounds good.
1060740	1065420	You are going to find that she has an Etsy page for her taxidermy.
1065420	1066700	She's a taxidermist.
1066700	1070100	What's her last name, Julie Maxwell.
1070100	1075580	Maybe like a few, uh, disorderly conduct charges from a couple of years ago.
1075580	1076580	Here in town.
1076580	1077580	Here in town.
1077580	1078580	Was it alcohol related?
1078580	1079580	Yeah.
1079580	1087260	And then also she was given a restraining order 15 years ago and it was against a Leo
1087260	1088260	piston.
1088780	1092260	So she got it awarded to her against Leo or Leo put it out on her.
1092260	1095740	Leo put it out on her and Leo is the junkyard man.
1095740	1096740	Right?
1096740	1097740	Yeah.
1097740	1099020	Is Leo the one we met or did we meet his man?
1099020	1103180	Maybe we shouldn't have let him just go home last night.
1103180	1105240	I hope they're still there.
1105240	1107820	What's what's Leo's brother's name, George.
1107820	1108820	And we talked to Leo.
1108820	1109820	Right.
1109820	1110820	I think we talked to Leo.
1110820	1111820	Yep.
1111820	1112820	All right.
1112820	1113820	Well let's take off toot sweet to the piston boys.
1113820	1116100	We at least got to inform him what happened on his property.
1116100	1118820	That can be the auspices in which we visit them.
1118820	1119820	Yeah.
1119820	1120820	Okay.
1120820	1125860	And just to stay on the same thread, you guys wanted to talk to the hospital about Julie
1125860	1127100	Maxwell's body.
1127100	1131900	So you have Drew send over a message to them saying that you want a full report on the
1131900	1134220	autopsy of Julie Maxwell's body.
1134220	1135220	Okay.
1135220	1139080	And then the three of you head out to the piston farm.
1139080	1141820	It's kind of by the junkyard in the far Southeast corner.
1141820	1143860	So they like live right next to it.
1143860	1144860	Gotcha.
1144860	1153980	Googled it and I did not use auspices close camera close.
1153980	1157380	Well too hungover for some of these words.
1157380	1158380	Happy new year.
1158380	1159380	Okay.
1159380	1161580	So the three of you drive out to the piston farm.
1161580	1163160	It's a pig farm.
1163160	1168900	And when you arrive, it's on the old country road and there is a gate that is locked at
1168900	1170780	the insurance farm gate.
1170780	1171780	Yeah.
1171780	1172780	Call Leo.
1172780	1173780	You got his number, right?
1173820	1174820	Hey Leo.
1174820	1175820	Oh, the farm.
1175820	1181860	You can see the farm and it is probably 150 yards off the road.
1181860	1184300	I started hollering, but I also call him on myself.
1184300	1186300	I call him on myself.
1186300	1187300	Click.
1187300	1188300	Hey.
1188300	1190300	Oh, I thought, I thought he hung up.
1190300	1191300	Hello?
1191300	1192300	Hey Leo.
1192300	1193300	Hey buddy.
1193300	1194300	We're we're outside.
1194300	1198660	We need to, uh, yeah, this is, uh, this is John Lee Pettymore, the fourth of a deputy.
1198660	1199660	You know me, Leo.
1199660	1200660	You're the deputy?
1200660	1201660	I'm a deputy.
1201660	1202660	All right.
1202740	1205960	Just four, one we rarely see.
1205960	1206960	Can you let us in buddy?
1206960	1207960	To what?
1207960	1208960	You guys got my key?
1208960	1209960	Your pig farm?
1209960	1213340	Your very ominous pig farm.
1213340	1216300	We do also have his key to return to him.
1216300	1217860	We told him that we would do this.
1217860	1218860	Yeah.
1218860	1219860	Hey Leo, that's why we're here.
1219860	1221060	We're bringing you your key back.
1221060	1223100	I'll be right out.
1223100	1229320	So you wait a second after the phone call ends and his beat up old truck comes driving
1229320	1233440	down the road and goes up to the other side of the gate and he gets out of the truck
1233440	1237400	and walks up, kind of leans over the gate and he's still, he's wearing those overalls
1237400	1241160	and they're covered in shit and he's got no shirt on underneath it.
1241160	1248240	He's got one of the overalls, unstrapped, all sexy like, and uh, he leans over and he's
1248240	1249240	like, all right.
1249240	1251240	It's like piggy couture.
1251240	1254320	You got my key?
1254320	1255320	Oh boy.
1255320	1258160	Can't nail this voice down.
1258160	1259160	What's happening?
1260000	1265220	And cut and you got my key?
1265220	1266220	And one more.
1266220	1268000	You got my key?
1268000	1269000	Let's try it.
1269000	1270000	Let's try a funny one.
1270000	1271000	I'm so angry.
1271000	1272000	You got my key.
1272000	1273000	Sad.
1273000	1274000	One more time.
1274000	1275000	I think you nailed this.
1275000	1276000	I've got my key.
1276000	1277000	No, Leo.
1277000	1278000	Actually we do.
1278000	1279000	That's why we're here.
1279000	1280600	Oh, I like that back now.
1280600	1281600	Can we come in?
1281600	1284160	Could you put on some tea for us Leo?
1284160	1285160	We'd like to talk.
1285800	1291840	If you want to give me my key and then we could say bye, that'd be best case scenario
1291840	1292840	for me.
1292840	1295680	Well, Leo, that makes me want to talk to you even more.
1295680	1299800	Well, I'm a fun boy to talk to, but I just like my key.
1299800	1300800	Yeah.
1300800	1304200	Let's, uh, let us in here.
1304200	1310300	We'll, we'll get you your key once we settle down and, and, and y'all stay right there
1310300	1313720	and I'll reach my hand over this fence here, which I'm doing now.
1314720	1315720	Put your hands up.
1315720	1316720	Oh geez.
1316720	1317720	Okay.
1317720	1322320	So now he's horrified and he puts his hands straight in the air and he's like, what?
1322320	1323320	We're all good here.
1323320	1325120	Let's just go back to your house.
1325120	1326120	Let's sit down.
1326120	1327120	Let's have a drink.
1327120	1328600	And we gotta have, we have a few questions.
1328600	1329600	I'll be right back.
1329600	1332600	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1332600	1333600	Okay.
1333600	1334600	Well we hop over the gate.
1334600	1335600	Yeah.
1335600	1336600	We come in.
1336600	1339400	Oh, he comes back on his cell phone and he's like, George, George, the police are here
1339400	1343320	and they hopped over the fence, but I don't think you should, they should be here.
1343320	1347640	They just came to return my key and now they're on the property.
1347640	1349680	So yeah, that actually, that we probably fucked up there.
1349680	1355400	If you could, if you could come down here and then he listens for a second and he's
1355400	1361920	like, Oh, warrant, warrant, warrant and or probable cause warrant.
1361920	1362920	Yeah.
1362920	1367520	Our probable cause is a dead body and you having a pig farm and it was on the dead body
1367520	1369120	was on your property.
1369120	1371320	There's a dead body on my property.
1371320	1372320	You knew this.
1372320	1374400	We told you this last night.
1374400	1376260	I'm angry at this guy right now.
1376260	1382040	I don't know him very well and he's not following my city cop orders and I'm kind of mad at
1382040	1383040	him.
1383040	1386160	So I'm going to step in the middle and try and diffuse the situation.
1386160	1387600	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1387600	1390320	Hey, hey, uh, Keith, hang on, hang on a second.
1390320	1393600	Hey, I've got my hand on my gun and I'm looking at it.
1393600	1394600	Leo.
1394600	1395600	Uh, I'm sorry.
1395600	1397200	We, we kind of bum rush you right here like this.
1397200	1399760	Uh, it's just, we've got a, we're all pretty hungover.
1400280	1402200	We got a pretty strong case going here.
1402200	1406560	That's uh, it's real messed up, but uh, there's a chance that Julie Maxwell's caught up in
1406560	1407560	something here.
1407560	1409880	We found out that you had a restraining order against her.
1409880	1411800	We just wanted to know what that was about.
1411800	1412800	Yeah.
1412800	1413800	What's up with Julie Maxwell?
1413800	1414800	What an elegant way to put it.
1414800	1422080	I just don't, you know, that was the past and it's over and I, and she's, she's fine
1422080	1425320	now and everything, I did everything fine.
1425320	1426320	I'm fine.
1426320	1427320	No, no.
1427320	1429520	We know you got the restraining order against her.
1429520	1430520	We know that.
1430520	1431520	Yeah.
1431520	1432640	We just wondered what was the cause of all that?
1432640	1435800	It was because she thought I'd done killed her sister.
1435800	1438120	Why did she think that you killed her sister?
1438120	1441200	I accidentally, huh.
1441200	1444620	Wait, would we know about this case?
1444620	1449120	Go ahead and roll, uh, not you Keith, but the other two who are in town.
1449120	1450440	If you want to roll law.
1450440	1451440	Yeah.
1451440	1452440	54 and a 50.
1452440	1453440	Oh, bummer.
1453440	1454440	Uh, 29 on a 60.
1454440	1455440	Oh, awesome.
1455440	1464400	Uh, Clark Bishop, you would remember roughly 15 and a half years ago or so Leo piston,
1464400	1472200	uh, was involved in a manslaughter case for the death of Julie Maxwell's younger sister.
1472200	1473200	He did a year in juvie.
1473200	1475480	Wait, how old was he at the time?
1475480	1476640	He was 16.
1476640	1477920	How old is he right now?
1477920	1481120	Well, that was about, yeah, he's like 32.
1481120	1483160	Were you just testing his math?
1484160	1490040	I was thinking of Leo is like a 60 year old man.
1490040	1494040	So that no, I definitely did not think this Leo.
1494040	1498480	You look a little worse for where I think this Julie business has been, it's been way
1498480	1499480	in on you.
1499480	1503320	I've been, I'm been good and I've been good and everything's been fine.
1503320	1505080	Does Clark remember the sister's name?
1505080	1512400	Uh, her sister's name was, uh, it was, uh, well, Ashley boom.
1513240	1516480	Does Clark connect the dots?
1516480	1520640	As soon as he hears Leo say that, would I have been like, Oh yeah, the Maxwell girls,
1520640	1521640	like, did I know them?
1521640	1525480	You wouldn't, it was kind of a big deal, but that was 15 years ago and a lot, you know,
1525480	1526480	a lot of stuff happened.
1526480	1528440	A lot of clinkers between then and now.
1528440	1529940	A lot of TV dinners.
1529940	1533680	They were going for a second degree, which is a cop.
1533680	1536680	I of course know means.
1536680	1547480	Well, obviously as a cop manslaughter law and order has taught us is when some somebody's
1547480	1550320	dead, but you didn't mean nothing.
1550320	1556580	Second degree murder is any intentional murder with malice, a forethought, but is not premeditated
1556580	1557580	or planned.
1557580	1558580	Hmm.
1558580	1559580	A crime of passion.
1559580	1563280	We're in a pretty heated moment in world right now.
1563280	1564280	Definitely.
1564280	1567000	All these memories are flooding into your brain.
1567000	1574140	Clark Leo immediately just throws his hands into his overalls like kind of childlike hands
1574140	1575140	in his shirt.
1575140	1578400	Luke, I think you said Keith Vigna has his hand on his gun.
1578400	1583980	Yeah, I have my hand on my gun, but also I can sense the little relationship that Clark
1583980	1585360	and him have going on.
1585360	1589000	So I moved my hand from my gun to my taser.
1589000	1591520	Keith, Keith, there's no need for that.
1591520	1593680	I looked, I'm looking straight at Leo.
1594080	1595080	Leo's a good boy.
1595080	1597760	I'm a good, I'm a good, I'm a good, I'm a good boy.
1597760	1598760	He's a good boy to talk to.
1598760	1599760	I'm a good boy.
1599760	1601800	Let's go back to your house and let's talk about this.
1601800	1602800	No, it's fine.
1602800	1603800	It's fine.
1603800	1604800	No, we can talk.
1604800	1605800	We can talk right here.
1605800	1606800	We can talk right here at this gate.
1606800	1607800	I turned to Keith.
1607800	1608800	Hey, Keith.
1608800	1616960	I forgot that I knew all about this restraining order that Ashley girl, that happened right
1616960	1619080	around when I joined up with the force.
1619080	1620680	It was, it was a bad time.
1620680	1625000	I ease my grip up on my taser, but I'm still kind of hovering.
1625000	1626000	I turn back to Leo.
1626000	1627000	Leo.
1627000	1628000	I'm sorry we brought all that up.
1628000	1630520	It's just, we've got a, we've got a real sticky case here.
1630520	1631520	Sticky?
1631520	1632520	Hairy.
1632520	1636080	Hey Leo though, have you had any contact with Julie in the past few weeks?
1636080	1637080	No, no.
1637080	1638080	She stayed away.
1638080	1639080	She stayed away.
1639080	1640760	She hasn't, she hasn't reached out to you recently?
1640760	1641760	No.
1641760	1645800	I think with that information that you had before, you would know that the, her sister
1645800	1648760	died on December 1st, 15 years ago.
1648760	1651000	So wait, this is the anniversary or the day after?
1651000	1652560	Yesterday was the anniversary.
1652560	1653560	Wow.
1653560	1654560	Bad day for her parents.
1654560	1660840	I look, I look right at Leo and I go, do you know anyone that drives a white Honda Toyota?
1660840	1661840	A white Honda Toyota?
1661840	1664920	A white Toyota Honda Accord Civic.
1664920	1667000	Leo, you know anybody in town who has a white Toyota?
1667000	1670160	Leo, do you know anybody that drives a, is it a Toyota?
1670160	1671160	Yeah.
1671160	1672160	Do you know anybody?
1672160	1673160	Sorry.
1673160	1674160	No, it's really funny.
1674160	1676480	No, this is definitely the guy you should ask about this.
1676480	1678480	Do you know anybody in town?
1678480	1681480	Leo, where's the chief?
1681480	1687480	Hey, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a good detective.
1687480	1691480	Leo, do you know anybody in town that drives a white Toyota?
1691480	1692480	What?
1692480	1693480	Don't.
1693480	1694480	Why are you changing that?
1694480	1699280	My hand goes back to my taser.
1699280	1701760	Tell me if you know anybody that drives a white Toyota.
1701760	1704000	I don't know anybody that drives a white Toyota.
1704000	1707920	How can I believe you?
1707920	1708920	Roll human.
1708920	1711120	That's exactly how I get it.
1711120	1712120	Yeah.
1712120	1713120	There's mechanics for that.
1713120	1714120	I got a 74.
1714120	1715120	On a what?
1715120	1716120	On an 80.
1716120	1717120	Oh, for real?
1717120	1718120	For real.
1718120	1719120	Okay.
1719120	1720120	Damn.
1720120	1721120	He, he is scared.
1721120	1722720	He is very, very scared.
1722720	1725400	Is there an intimidate roll that I can do?
1725400	1726480	Leo, I'm really sorry.
1726480	1728120	We are not our best today.
1728120	1729120	We're a little unfocused.
1729120	1730560	Can I have my key back?
1730560	1734480	We frankly don't know why we're here.
1734480	1735480	I just want my key.
1735480	1736480	It just seemed like the right thing to do.
1736480	1737840	I just want my key back.
1737840	1740600	We're going to need that for a couple more days probably.
1740600	1741600	What happened?
1741600	1744000	Well, we were hoping you could fill in some blanks earlier.
1744000	1748440	I just came out last night and brought y'all the key and then I left and y'all said something
1748440	1749440	bad happened.
1749440	1750440	What happened?
1750440	1754040	Hey, I know it didn't have a face and all, but did you recognize that body laying in
1754040	1755040	your garbage yard?
1755040	1756040	There was a what?
1756040	1757960	And he immediately gets back on the phone.
1757960	1758960	Did he?
1758960	1760120	Did we not?
1760120	1764600	My taser is unholstered.
1764600	1767720	He turns around and he's like walking back towards his truck.
1767720	1770920	George, George, there was a body found at the junkyard.
1770920	1773180	Yeah, I don't know.
1773180	1774180	I don't know.
1774180	1775180	I come up behind Leo.
1775180	1778120	Hey Leo, is that George on the phone there?
1778120	1779120	Yeah.
1779120	1781120	Would you mind if I talked to him?
1781120	1788120	Okay, George, I'm going to give the phone to Clark Bishop, the chief man, the cop police.
1788120	1789640	And he hands you the phone.
1790160	1791160	Hey, George.
1791160	1792160	It's Clark.
1792160	1793160	Hey.
1793160	1794160	Hi.
1794160	1795160	Yeah, this is me.
1795160	1796160	I'm George.
1796160	1797160	We're up here.
1797160	1798160	We're returning your brother's key to the lot.
1798160	1799160	Yeah.
1799160	1801160	Will you stop giving him so much trouble and give him the key?
1801160	1802160	Yeah.
1802160	1806360	I got to tell you though, George, we found a body last night out there at the yard.
1806360	1809960	Yeah, that's what Leo just said.
1809960	1810960	What kind of body?
1810960	1813000	Are you talking a weirdly coyote?
1813000	1814000	Talking coyotes?
1814000	1817400	No, it's a human body.
1817400	1819200	We found a dead woman on your property.
1819760	1820760	The fuck you did?
1820760	1821760	What?
1821760	1826240	Yeah, so we've got some questions for you and your brother.
1826240	1828240	Is there a time you guys can meet us down at the station?
1828240	1830680	Yeah, I suppose we can make that happen.
1830680	1833640	Gosh, does it have to be today?
1833640	1834640	Preferably, yeah.
1834640	1838400	As he's talking, I'm poking him on the arm like, I want to talk.
1838400	1841120	We'll meet you there around five.
1841120	1842120	Does that work?
1842120	1843120	Yeah, that sounds good.
1843120	1844120	All right.
1844120	1845120	Now will you give my brother his key back?
1845120	1846120	Of course.
1846120	1847120	Get off our property please.
1847120	1848120	We're heading out of here right now.
1848120	1849120	What does he say?
1850040	1851040	What does he say?
1851040	1852040	I want to talk to him.
1852040	1853040	Let me talk to him.
1853040	1854040	I put him back on with Leo.
1854040	1855040	What does he say?
1855040	1856040	Yeah, he's going to come in and talk to us.
1856040	1858360	Don't need to give him any time to talk to each other and plan something out.
1858360	1859360	I want to talk to him right now.
1859360	1864440	A smart thing to do as RPG players, but probably a bad thing to do as cops would be to have
1864440	1866280	made a copy of that key.
1866280	1872880	Well, you know, hindsight is a crit success.
1872880	1877220	Hindsight screwed the pitch, bro.
1877220	1879340	It's like three o'clock or so, right?
1879340	1880340	Yeah, it's like three o'clock.
1880340	1882620	So it's only a couple hours.
1882620	1884420	If you're concerned about it, we could watch the house.
1884420	1886460	Keith Vigna is very suspicious.
1886460	1887460	I'm going to stay here.
1887460	1890660	I'm going to stay here and make sure they don't leave before they go to the PD.
1890660	1891660	Okay, for sure.
1891660	1893180	Do you give Leo his key back?
1893180	1894180	Okay, cool.
1894180	1896460	As soon as he gets it, he gets it back on the key ring.
1896460	1898580	As I'm handing it over, I'm like, so I'm sorry about this, Leo.
1898580	1901900	I know it was real, real frightening, but we just had to figure some stuff out.
1901900	1902900	We're all good though now.
1902900	1903900	We're good?
1903900	1904900	Yeah.
1904900	1905900	You and your brother are going to come down and talk.
1905900	1906900	You'll have him there.
1907580	1911300	And hopefully over the course of the day, we all get a lot more focused and disciplined.
1911300	1912300	I believe in you.
1912300	1914300	I bet y'all can do it.
1914300	1916700	Really get our heads straight on what we're trying to do here.
1916700	1921260	I really bet y'all have direction and purpose in all of your decisions.
1921260	1924120	Leo, you are nothing short of an angel.
1924120	1925980	And you, sir, are my wings.
1925980	1929380	All right, I'll see you at clinkers, buddy.
1929380	1934420	While I stay here, I want to find somewhere that I can hide out, that I can see the entrance,
1934420	1936860	but I don't want them to know that I stayed behind.
1936860	1937860	Okay.
1937860	1939940	Is there like a tree line close or like-
1939940	1942360	Are you doing this to hide to see if they talk to each other?
1942360	1943360	They live together?
1943360	1944360	No.
1944360	1945360	Which we also knew.
1945360	1948940	In my mind, I knew that they lived together all the time.
1948940	1954820	I just, I wanted to see the comings and goings and kind of like try to be a little spy.
1954820	1956460	Can I roll something besides stealth?
1956460	1958500	You can roll law.
1958500	1959980	That's a 30 on a 40.
1959980	1960980	Oh, nice.
1960980	1963860	So yeah, you can find a nice spot where you would be able to keep an eye on their comings
1963860	1965980	and goings.
1965980	1967940	Tell me how much I can get away with here.
1967940	1975740	I get into my car and I pull it into a little clearing in the woods and my car is hidden,
1975740	1980860	but I'm standing outside of my car, eyes scanning for now, because I think what I'm going to
1980860	1982480	do is do a little walk around.
1982480	1983480	For sure.
1983480	1984480	Sounds good.
1984480	1985480	Cool.
1985480	1986480	Thomas and Joe, what do you guys want to do?
1986480	1988700	Probably I'm heading back to the station to get ready for the interview.
1988700	1989700	Okay, cool.
1989700	1993820	When I get to the station, I'm probably looking at any updates as far as maybe the information
1993820	1998180	from the hospital about Julie, maybe checking in with Drew about the chief, all that kind
1998180	1999180	of stuff.
1999180	2000860	Okay, so when you get back to the police station-
2000860	2002860	I want to read the chief's journals.
2002860	2004220	Okay, sounds good.
2004220	2009260	You would know from working with Chief Maggie Cook that she always carried a blue notebook
2009260	2010660	with her everywhere she went.
2010660	2013460	What was the color of the notebook that Drew gave her?
2013460	2015980	Yellow was the color of the notebook that was gifted.
2015980	2018200	The blue one is on her desk.
2018200	2020380	The yellow one is not in her office.
2020380	2023020	A red leather notebook and a yellow leather notebook?
2023020	2026460	I was thinking more of like, Zach, what's your favorite Bourne Ruffins album?
2026460	2031220	And why is it red, yellow, and blue?
2031220	2033640	There are three colors that these notebooks come in.
2033640	2037980	The third is red and there is not a red notebook in this office.
2037980	2041020	The blue notebook is a day-by-day journal of sorts.
2041020	2044580	It has to-do lists, grocery lists, and random thoughts.
2044580	2049140	It's basically her notepad app for a phone, but it's physical copies she carries around
2049140	2050140	everywhere she goes.
2050140	2051460	Oh my God, Zach.
2051460	2056940	It's basically her notepad app for her phone, but she carries it around physically.
2056940	2057940	It's her notepad.
2057940	2059940	Yeah, that's what I said.
2059940	2060940	Dog.
2060940	2061940	Cat.
2061940	2067100	What are we doing?
2067100	2072180	Millennial trash.
2072180	2077460	It is dated on the front and then a dash and no end date on it, but the first date is like
2077460	2079940	November 3rd or something like that.
2079940	2084460	So this is since November 3rd to December 1st are her notes.
2084460	2086820	And it fills up like three quarters of this notebook.
2086820	2087820	Chief is thorough.
2087820	2088820	She's very thorough.
2088820	2089820	She's very good at her job.
2089820	2092620	But most of what's in there is notes about her job.
2092620	2095540	Clark Bishop, as you sit down, what were you looking into?
2095540	2101140	Seeing if we got anything back about Julie in the hospital about her death and all that
2101140	2102140	stuff.
2102140	2103140	Oh yeah.
2103140	2108660	The hospital actually called and this is the craziest thing, but they heard screaming coming
2108660	2113820	from the morgue and it turns out that Julie Maxwell pronounced dead.
2113820	2115060	Not actually dead.
2115060	2116060	Yeah.
2116060	2122040	They, somebody did it wrong and how can you live without a face?
2122040	2129260	So you say to yourself as you're in the office reading a notebook runs down my spot.
2129260	2131980	This face stuff is really getting to John Lee.
2131980	2133860	Pettymore values his face.
2133860	2135000	Is it drew?
2135000	2136000	She in the city.
2136000	2137220	This is the hospital in the city.
2137220	2138220	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
