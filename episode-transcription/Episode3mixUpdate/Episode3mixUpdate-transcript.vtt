WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.820
Good morning my babies, it's everybody's favorite radio DJing contention wolf the dog and we

00:07.820 --> 00:16.020
are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP today with a little news for y'all.

00:16.020 --> 00:20.700
Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and let me tell y'all she is pissed about

00:20.700 --> 00:23.960
it she is not happy at all.

00:23.960 --> 00:32.080
Jimmy sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on those sweet sweet good mushrooms.

00:32.080 --> 00:37.280
And Mildred Mitchell that old cookie pot head saw a bright flash of light from across the

00:37.280 --> 00:42.020
street in John Peters house and now speaking of that old boy wouldn't you know it John

00:42.020 --> 00:46.680
Peters is missing heard he had a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago poor guy

00:46.680 --> 00:48.840
can't catch a break.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.880
And two people came to John Peters house packed a drunken to their white Toyota and took off

00:53.880 --> 01:00.200
coming in hot off the presses we got a new song for y'all it's No Backbone by Kudzu.

01:23.880 --> 01:35.440
Remember when my knee was up this morning and you kept saying that it was my boner?

01:35.440 --> 01:36.440
That was funny.

01:36.440 --> 01:41.260
Luke was on the couch like prone right and his knee was just like right in the middle

01:41.260 --> 01:45.880
of his body sticking straight up and it looked like his dick was like a uh.

01:45.880 --> 01:52.280
As big as it is if not smaller.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.680
What happened last time Zach?

01:53.680 --> 01:59.680
Last time you guys were standing at John Peters house and uh you just reviewed Keith Vigna's

01:59.680 --> 02:00.680
excellent policing.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
Yeah you're welcome for that.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.440
If I remember it seemed like a really anticlimactic place to end an episode.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.440
Yeah yeah yeah.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.480
Because I didn't do any I didn't have a climax.

02:10.480 --> 02:16.860
You had figured out that Mildred Mitchell drives a white car.

02:16.860 --> 02:18.960
Is this a goddamn logic problem?

02:18.960 --> 02:24.000
Mildred Mitchell drives a white car but John Peters will never eat ham.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.240
John Peters drives a maroon car.

02:26.240 --> 02:31.400
We decided it was something like a Cutlass Supreme or a La Sabre or it could be a Honda

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Civic.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.240
And the car that came picked up the trunk and also drove off with John Peters car were

02:37.240 --> 02:40.480
two men in a white Toyota.

02:40.480 --> 02:41.480
Fucking exotic dude.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.600
You ever been to Japan?

02:43.600 --> 02:46.080
It might it might be exotic for contention.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.320
What did the trunk say?

02:47.320 --> 02:49.640
Do not open if you want to live.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.640
Correct?

02:50.640 --> 02:51.640
Yes.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.840
Or conversely it said open if you want to die.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.280
That was just implied.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.720
It's about 2pm on December 2nd.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.580
Today's actually January 1st.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.580
But um chuh dude.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.580
Happy New Year.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.280
I had a great time last night.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
Me too.

03:07.280 --> 03:13.120
I repeatedly told you that I loved you a lot and it still rings true today.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.680
We'll see about tomorrow but.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.680
I wish you'd been there.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.680
Me too.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
I was sleepy.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.040
Hahaha.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.040
Dude wait here.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.040
Can you do this?

03:21.040 --> 03:27.840
For the listeners, Thomas and Luke are drying up their top lip and the gums above their

03:27.840 --> 03:28.840
front teeth.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.400
Joe just like moved his lip a little bit and was doing it.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
Pretty much there.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.720
It's kind of my face.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.440
He had that dry vape mouth.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.640
You got a real wet mouth so I got to dry mine off.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.640
I got weird teeth.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.800
The best way to do it is like to not have to move your muscles in your lip and just

03:43.800 --> 03:46.040
have it hang on there because of how dry it is.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.680
Do we really know that it's a white Toyota that went blazing by?

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
Yeah we found that out.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.680
That the men came in.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.680
Not for sure.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
That's what Mildred told you.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.040
I don't think we can put out an APB for a white Toyota.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.000
Yeah also we didn't.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.040
Wait were they in a white Toyota?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.920
Cause she drives a white car right?

04:03.920 --> 04:04.920
Yep.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.920
And they were in a white Toyota.

04:05.920 --> 04:06.920
Yep.

04:06.920 --> 04:07.920
I think this is a dead end guys.

04:07.920 --> 04:08.920
Wait hold on.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.340
Is this a cool like knocking on the door sound?

04:11.340 --> 04:12.340
Hold on.

04:12.340 --> 04:13.340
No.

04:13.340 --> 04:16.220
It's like a really weird hollow metal door.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.220
Yeah it is.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.220
Okay let's go.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.220
Set the scene.

04:19.220 --> 04:25.020
The three of you are standing in the midst of Keith Vigna's excellent police work and

04:25.020 --> 04:31.780
Mildred Mitchell is headed back across the street to her home which has her white car

04:31.780 --> 04:32.780
in the driveway.

04:32.780 --> 04:38.300
There's a black car in her driveway as well since we're just talking colors of cars.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.260
I drive a silver car.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.020
That's a police work that I do.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.860
What color is your car?

04:44.860 --> 04:48.740
Got it.

04:48.740 --> 04:52.280
Radical new direction for the podcast.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
What color is your car?

04:53.280 --> 04:54.280
What color is your car?

04:54.280 --> 04:56.020
Are we in the house or out of the house right now?

04:56.020 --> 04:58.500
I think you are standing in the house of John.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.460
Can I roll a search roll just to do.

05:01.460 --> 05:03.380
I think you already crit succeeded right?

05:03.380 --> 05:07.200
Well I yeah I crit succeeded but I also want to do just one more just because I feel so

05:07.200 --> 05:11.760
bad about how shitty I did this first that first time around where.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.080
You're like seeing their faces.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.680
I think that's a really good direction for your character to go.

05:16.680 --> 05:21.100
I really want to redeem myself on this like shoddy police work that I've done and I want

05:21.100 --> 05:25.480
to like try to find something now and be like oh yeah I remember that.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.720
You like see the faces of your fellow police officers and want to work even harder.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.040
Tell me if it's good or not, 21?

05:32.040 --> 05:36.840
You look around the house you see that the trunk is no longer there and the picture frames

05:36.840 --> 05:44.000
that you saw earlier are cleaned up, the bedding stubs are still there, bottles are still around.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.800
The people who were clearly here did not drop anything.

05:47.800 --> 05:51.000
I want to look at the pictures real fast are they anything interesting?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.120
Picture the family right?

05:52.120 --> 05:57.840
Yeah basically it's just pictures of him and like maybe some friends from college.

05:57.840 --> 06:04.160
He obviously doesn't have like a nuclear family he has like cousins and friends.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.400
But they were broken before and now they're all cleaned up?

06:06.400 --> 06:10.640
They would probably want to move them in order to have a clear path.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.320
So obviously he did not come back to the house.

06:13.320 --> 06:17.200
So we got to figure out who was in that white Toyota.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.280
Who do we know who drives a white Toyota?

06:20.280 --> 06:26.000
You guys would also be dealing with the fact that there was a dead body out in the junkyard

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
last night?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
That's true.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.160
I think this is not a huge concern for us right now honestly.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.840
Frankly all that seems secondary to the city councilor stuff.

06:34.840 --> 06:41.800
I just wonder if we were real police officers we wouldn't just be like oh well.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.880
Like how would we wrap this up as far as a case goes?

06:43.880 --> 06:48.080
I don't know I feel like if there's three of us on the force and a murder just happened

06:48.080 --> 06:50.340
this is not gonna be in our mind.

06:50.340 --> 06:55.720
This is only important because we're playing a mystery podcast.

06:55.720 --> 07:01.480
You guys literally went to a like drunk fueled site that didn't exist and you went to talk

07:01.480 --> 07:03.860
to a council person about their dog.

07:03.860 --> 07:08.100
The hardest lead we have right now towards the big mystery is the dogs.

07:08.100 --> 07:14.100
What I'm really concerned about now is I made the chief cry with a gift that I didn't actually

07:14.100 --> 07:15.760
get her that I said was mine.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.500
And I'm really concerned about finding out where she is.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.820
You wanna go hit up that chief?

07:19.820 --> 07:21.820
That is probably the most pressing mystery.

07:21.820 --> 07:24.900
We all drive all three of our cop cars back to the station.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.300
Did I lay out too many mysteries right off the top?

07:28.300 --> 07:32.300
No we're just bad.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.620
I think it's good leads to more.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.980
You just gotta focus our energy on...

07:36.980 --> 07:42.420
Okay let me get an intelligence check from whoever has the highest intelligence.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.420
I got 50.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.420
75?

07:44.420 --> 07:45.420
55.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.420
Yes.

07:46.420 --> 07:50.860
You do have the dead body and you basically have one lead from that.

07:50.860 --> 07:54.100
Which is the woman who called and then crashed your car.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.260
Have we heard back from the coroner on...

07:56.260 --> 07:57.260
Yes.

07:57.260 --> 07:59.260
She had the brand on her back that said this is a fool.

07:59.260 --> 08:00.260
Oh that's right.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.260
Would I know this?

08:01.260 --> 08:09.060
The brand that she had on her back was that in like the same size or font that the do

08:09.060 --> 08:12.740
not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.660
You haven't seen a picture of the back.

08:14.660 --> 08:19.820
Hey do you guys have a picture of the back that I could see?

08:19.820 --> 08:21.980
He says to the wind.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.260
Hey uh...

08:24.260 --> 08:28.580
We all look at Keith.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.580
What?

08:30.180 --> 08:31.180
She was...

08:31.180 --> 08:35.140
This just popped up in my mind because I'm a good detective.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.140
He says confidently.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.900
I'm a good detective.

08:37.900 --> 08:43.220
So what I just thought that neither of you did, which proves how good of a detective

08:43.220 --> 08:45.480
I am.

08:45.480 --> 08:52.520
So the do not open if you want to live was branded into the trunk and that lady had that

08:52.520 --> 08:53.980
brand in her back.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.860
Yeah so I'd like to see a picture of the text on her back.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.100
We can just have the coroner send that over.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.460
Yeah what do you guys want to do next?

09:02.460 --> 09:06.200
I think we maybe are interested in what's going on with the chief.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.300
So I would call her real quick first.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.160
Okay so you left John Peters house in what state?

09:11.160 --> 09:12.160
I closed.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.820
It seems like Keith did his due diligence so.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.420
We closed the door this time.

09:17.420 --> 09:18.420
And then just bailed.

09:18.420 --> 09:19.420
And we leave.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.420
Alright cool.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.320
So you guys are back at the police station.

09:22.320 --> 09:27.260
You let Drew know that you want to get a hold of county and get a picture of the back of

09:27.260 --> 09:28.660
the body that was found out in the junkyard.

09:28.660 --> 09:32.420
Honestly I'd like to have all the pictures that the coroner took just for posterity.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.420
Sure.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.420
Perfect absolutely.

09:34.420 --> 09:39.100
So none of this in the box that we gave her made any sense to you?

09:39.100 --> 09:40.260
I didn't recognize any of it.

09:40.260 --> 09:46.140
It seemed like it might be symbolic of some sort of stratification in the city or perhaps

09:46.140 --> 09:47.140
amongst the cult.

09:47.140 --> 09:51.780
I panicked when that box was there and I said yeah I gave that to you.

09:51.780 --> 09:54.340
Didn't know that it would make her react that way so.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.620
I asked Drew so you didn't see anybody drop off that box?

09:57.620 --> 09:58.620
No.

09:58.620 --> 09:59.980
I called the chief.

09:59.980 --> 10:01.620
Okay on her cell phone.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.140
It goes straight to voicemail.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.220
In my seventeen years with her.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.220
This has never happened.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.220
Not even remotely?

10:07.220 --> 10:08.220
Not even close.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.380
Okay so I'm a little maybe worried.

10:09.380 --> 10:10.380
I would be.

10:10.380 --> 10:14.140
Guys I think I'm going to go head over to the chiefs house just check on her.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.900
She's never missed a day of work like this before.

10:15.900 --> 10:19.780
Can I ride along with you I just I feel really really really bad.

10:19.780 --> 10:20.780
Yeah sure.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.420
I just want to apologize when we see her.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.100
John Lee what are you thinking?

10:24.100 --> 10:25.220
A man of few words.

10:25.220 --> 10:27.500
Which ones do you want to use to describe your actions?

10:27.500 --> 10:28.500
Tag.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.500
Tag along.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
Are you going to come with?

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
Yeah.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.500
Might as well.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.500
Shotgun.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.500
We do that.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.500
Okay you guys head over to the chiefs house.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.940
The chief lives in the old neighborhood right by beans pond.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.020
She has.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.020
A nice old house.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.020
Is that the northwest?

10:43.020 --> 10:44.020
Is that beans pond?

10:44.020 --> 10:46.020
No this is just southwest of downtown.

10:46.020 --> 10:51.680
Where is the chiefs house in relation to John Peters and also Kerry pages?

10:51.680 --> 10:59.620
The chief lives a few blocks northeast of John Peters and Mildred Mitchell and just

10:59.620 --> 11:02.720
east of pages Kerry pages.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.080
So they're all like within blocks of each other?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.080
Oh yeah.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
Cool.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.080
Yep yep yep yep yep.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.160
So you go to the chiefs house and her cruiser is not out front.

11:12.160 --> 11:17.380
Does she drive her cruiser as her personal vehicle or does she have a personal vehicle?

11:17.380 --> 11:20.000
I think she probably has a truck.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Like a F-150.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.760
Can I do a search roll for the chief?

11:23.760 --> 11:28.480
Yeah go for it.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.520
He doesn't do a search roll for the chief.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.920
Eighty four on a fitty.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
You don't find her.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
Oh darn.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
Hey guys.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
Guys I've really tried my best here.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.020
Is her truck in the driveway?

11:39.020 --> 11:40.560
You would know.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.920
I think you've known her for a long time.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.520
Her truck is in the garage typically.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.720
I'm going to go and knock on the door.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.120
Okay there's no response.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.680
I look in the windows.

11:48.680 --> 11:53.200
There is probably just like one window up front that you can see through the curtains

11:53.200 --> 11:54.800
a little bit and you can't see it.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.640
Could you describe her house to me?

11:56.640 --> 11:57.640
It's nice.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.960
Like are we?

11:59.960 --> 12:00.960
Thank you for that.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.760
This is a range style house.

12:02.760 --> 12:07.120
It's got a nice little front patio area with a bench on it.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
Nice.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.120
Nice.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.120
Made a note.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.120
Cool.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.120
Rick?

12:12.120 --> 12:13.120
Uh yeah.

12:13.120 --> 12:14.120
Of course.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.120
What did it, what was my looking in the windows?

12:17.120 --> 12:18.120
What did that?

12:18.560 --> 12:19.560
See it's dark in there.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.560
There's no movement.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.560
I tried the handle.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.560
See if it's open.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
It's not.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
It's locked.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.880
I'm going to swing around back guys and see if the back door is open because I feel so

12:27.880 --> 12:32.640
bad about making her storm off and I just, I need to apologize and this seems a little

12:32.640 --> 12:33.640
fishy.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.640
I don't know.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.640
Go check it.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.640
So I'm going to, yeah.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.740
She's got a gate on her privacy fence that doesn't have a lock on it so you just go into

12:39.740 --> 12:44.780
her backyard and as you're walking through her backyard you can see in her back windows

12:44.780 --> 12:45.920
and the lights are off.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Nobody's home.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
I'm going to check the back door.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.720
Absolutely.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.720
Yeah.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.720
Hold on just a second.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.480
I'm going to do a roll for her real quick.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.800
That's a spoiler that she is alive.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.800
Oh yeah.

12:55.800 --> 12:56.800
No, no, no.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
Everything's locked up nice and tight.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
Everything's locked up.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
Okay.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.800
Yep.

13:00.800 --> 13:01.800
Well I swing back around front and uh.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.780
Uh you guys think we should uh go and check on uh at Klinker's?

13:05.780 --> 13:07.280
Does she hang out at Klinker's?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.440
That's where she does her drinking.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.280
I didn't, well the more you know.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.860
I didn't see her there last night.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.420
Let's go check and just see if, was it Harry Klinker?

13:14.420 --> 13:15.420
Who's the guy that runs that place?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.420
You know Harry.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.420
I don't know Harry.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.920
I don't know anybody in this town.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.920
It's a few boys.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.420
Let's go to Klinker's and check out and see if anybody saw her.

13:22.420 --> 13:27.740
If not, you know, I think between the three of us we can handle this murder mystery.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.460
We don't need the chief, but I'd love to apologize to her.

13:31.460 --> 13:33.700
Her steady guidance would be appreciated.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.900
So yeah, we head over to Klinker's.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.300
Okay, you walk into Klinker's.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.620
Klinker's is like a small shitty dive bar.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.760
When you walk in, there's cigarette smoke hanging in the air.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.000
There's three tables.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.340
There's a pool table and a bar.

13:47.340 --> 13:51.500
There's a couple of regulars in there and Harry, the owner and bartender is back behind

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
the bar.

13:52.500 --> 13:57.340
He is a tall older man with turkey neck and bad teeth.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.540
Yo turkey neck.

13:59.540 --> 14:03.860
You stand under your breath as you walk in.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.820
What did Harry do to you?

14:05.820 --> 14:06.820
Dick?

14:06.820 --> 14:11.100
I bet, like honestly, I bet Harry would be pretty anxious to see all three cops in town

14:11.100 --> 14:12.620
walk into his establishment.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.560
Absolutely he would be.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.560
Can we establish this?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.280
Do you know this guy?

14:17.280 --> 14:18.280
Probably.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.280
Yeah.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.280
I think we all do.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
I don't.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.280
I'm playing the new kid in town.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.280
I know, but you've been here for a few months.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.280
You probably at least.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.480
Wait, you are from here, right?

14:25.480 --> 14:29.160
I'm from here, like elementary school, moved to the city.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.240
Harry Klinker babysat every child.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.240
Yeah.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.240
He was my babysitter.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.760
Did your mama never drop you off at Klinker's?

14:35.760 --> 14:37.800
Oh, I forgot to mention there is a-

14:37.800 --> 14:38.800
There's a baby seat.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.280
You see, there's a doorway in the back right of the bar and it's got one of those baby

14:43.280 --> 14:48.640
gates on it and there are three toddlers standing over the edge trying to crawl over.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.640
No one's watching.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.640
Harry?

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
We have some questions for you.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.640
Hey, Harry.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
Well, hey, question.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.640
Have you seen the chief?

14:54.640 --> 14:57.640
Not in a couple of days.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.640
All right.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
Thanks.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
And we head out.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
Bye, Harry.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.640
Bye, Harry.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
See you tonight.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.980
That was Harry.

15:04.980 --> 15:08.880
As we walk out, I'm a little bit shaken.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.520
Did a bunch of memories from your childhood just come rushing back?

15:11.560 --> 15:15.040
I pull out my pack of cigarettes that you guys have never seen me smoke.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.760
Is this how you're going to vape on?

15:16.760 --> 15:18.760
No, no, no, no.

15:18.760 --> 15:23.640
I go, I just had some weird thoughts from my childhood come in.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.960
I spent more time at Klinker's when I was a kid than I have since I've lived here.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.800
Harry's like a second father to us all.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
Yeah.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
Oh, hey.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.800
You came outside, Harry?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.800
Yeah.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.120
He's been following you.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.280
He steps outside for a smoke.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.100
Nice fresh air.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.100
Harry, was Keith a picky eater?

15:44.100 --> 15:47.280
I like hot dog sandwiches.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.580
The city has changed you.

15:48.580 --> 15:54.180
You cut up those hot dogs that boy eat them up real quick on some white bread.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.300
Well, that doesn't really answer the question.

15:56.300 --> 16:01.220
Can't really say we offered him much else.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.220
So in your experience, no.

16:03.220 --> 16:06.060
He's the pickiest eater I've ever seen.

16:06.060 --> 16:09.500
He would only eat hot dogs cut up on white bread.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
What are you guys doing?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.300
Uh, where are we going?

16:12.300 --> 16:13.300
Great question.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.300
Okay.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.080
What's, what's the hottest lead we got?

16:16.080 --> 16:18.900
So I ran the body's prints and hair.

16:18.900 --> 16:19.900
Got nothing back.

16:19.900 --> 16:20.900
Yeah.

16:20.900 --> 16:21.900
Took the body to the corner.

16:21.900 --> 16:22.900
I guess we could run.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.380
Have I, have I seen, have I seen those pictures from Ju yet?

16:25.380 --> 16:26.380
Oh, uh, yeah.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.820
Drew will send them on over.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.260
Oh, go ahead and roll a sanity check for me.

16:30.260 --> 16:31.260
No.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.260
93.

16:32.260 --> 16:33.260
Okay.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.260
Yeah.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.740
You're going to lose one sanity as you see this brutal act shown out on this, uh, this

16:37.740 --> 16:39.300
woman's back.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.940
The skin is blistered and boiled around each letter.

16:42.940 --> 16:46.620
And instead of looking at the picture, I take his word for it.

16:46.620 --> 16:47.740
Smart.

16:47.740 --> 16:53.380
Did the corner and doing the autopsy of the body do anything more to identify it than

16:53.380 --> 16:54.380
we did?

16:54.380 --> 16:55.380
Would they have done anything like that?

16:55.380 --> 17:00.300
The report came back with a bunch of odd results, so they're going to run them again to double

17:00.300 --> 17:01.300
check some stuff.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.300
They're not sure what's going on.

17:02.300 --> 17:03.300
Okay.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.260
And then also the Julie gal who crashed her car.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.260
Yeah.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.260
Julie Maxwell.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.260
Rest in peace.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.220
Yeah.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.700
They called and said that she was pronounced dead last night.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.740
We should maybe do some investigation on her.

17:14.740 --> 17:19.380
We should probably get, uh, have the coroner look at her and give us some information.

17:19.380 --> 17:20.380
Some kind of inquest.

17:20.380 --> 17:24.220
Cause this is a, this is my main person of interest.

17:24.220 --> 17:27.620
John, when you searched her car, did you get identification?

17:27.620 --> 17:28.620
Yes.

17:28.620 --> 17:29.620
Let's look into that.

17:29.620 --> 17:30.620
Let's see if she's, let's run her name.

17:30.620 --> 17:31.620
See if she's on casenet.

17:31.620 --> 17:32.620
Yeah.

17:32.620 --> 17:33.620
Right.

17:33.620 --> 17:37.380
You want to just run her info in the database and maybe even Facebook or just like see if

17:37.380 --> 17:38.740
you get any background on her.

17:38.740 --> 17:39.740
Okay.

17:39.740 --> 17:40.740
Sounds good.

17:40.740 --> 17:45.420
You are going to find that she has an Etsy page for her taxidermy.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.700
She's a taxidermist.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.100
What's her last name, Julie Maxwell.

17:50.100 --> 17:55.580
Maybe like a few, uh, disorderly conduct charges from a couple of years ago.

17:55.580 --> 17:56.580
Here in town.

17:56.580 --> 17:57.580
Here in town.

17:57.580 --> 17:58.580
Was it alcohol related?

17:58.580 --> 17:59.580
Yeah.

17:59.580 --> 18:07.260
And then also she was given a restraining order 15 years ago and it was against a Leo

18:07.260 --> 18:08.260
piston.

18:08.780 --> 18:12.260
So she got it awarded to her against Leo or Leo put it out on her.

18:12.260 --> 18:15.740
Leo put it out on her and Leo is the junkyard man.

18:15.740 --> 18:16.740
Right?

18:16.740 --> 18:17.740
Yeah.

18:17.740 --> 18:19.020
Is Leo the one we met or did we meet his man?

18:19.020 --> 18:23.180
Maybe we shouldn't have let him just go home last night.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.240
I hope they're still there.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.820
What's what's Leo's brother's name, George.

18:27.820 --> 18:28.820
And we talked to Leo.

18:28.820 --> 18:29.820
Right.

18:29.820 --> 18:30.820
I think we talked to Leo.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.820
Yep.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.820
All right.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.820
Well let's take off toot sweet to the piston boys.

18:33.820 --> 18:36.100
We at least got to inform him what happened on his property.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.820
That can be the auspices in which we visit them.

18:38.820 --> 18:39.820
Yeah.

18:39.820 --> 18:40.820
Okay.

18:40.820 --> 18:45.860
And just to stay on the same thread, you guys wanted to talk to the hospital about Julie

18:45.860 --> 18:47.100
Maxwell's body.

18:47.100 --> 18:51.900
So you have Drew send over a message to them saying that you want a full report on the

18:51.900 --> 18:54.220
autopsy of Julie Maxwell's body.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.220
Okay.

18:55.220 --> 18:59.080
And then the three of you head out to the piston farm.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.820
It's kind of by the junkyard in the far Southeast corner.

19:01.820 --> 19:03.860
So they like live right next to it.

19:03.860 --> 19:04.860
Gotcha.

19:04.860 --> 19:13.980
Googled it and I did not use auspices close camera close.

19:13.980 --> 19:17.380
Well too hungover for some of these words.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.380
Happy new year.

19:18.380 --> 19:19.380
Okay.

19:19.380 --> 19:21.580
So the three of you drive out to the piston farm.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.160
It's a pig farm.

19:23.160 --> 19:28.900
And when you arrive, it's on the old country road and there is a gate that is locked at

19:28.900 --> 19:30.780
the insurance farm gate.

19:30.780 --> 19:31.780
Yeah.

19:31.780 --> 19:32.780
Call Leo.

19:32.780 --> 19:33.780
You got his number, right?

19:33.820 --> 19:34.820
Hey Leo.

19:34.820 --> 19:35.820
Oh, the farm.

19:35.820 --> 19:41.860
You can see the farm and it is probably 150 yards off the road.

19:41.860 --> 19:44.300
I started hollering, but I also call him on myself.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.300
I call him on myself.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.300
Click.

19:47.300 --> 19:48.300
Hey.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.300
Oh, I thought, I thought he hung up.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.300
Hello?

19:51.300 --> 19:52.300
Hey Leo.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.300
Hey buddy.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.300
We're we're outside.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.660
We need to, uh, yeah, this is, uh, this is John Lee Pettymore, the fourth of a deputy.

19:58.660 --> 19:59.660
You know me, Leo.

19:59.660 --> 20:00.660
You're the deputy?

20:00.660 --> 20:01.660
I'm a deputy.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.660
All right.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.960
Just four, one we rarely see.

20:05.960 --> 20:06.960
Can you let us in buddy?

20:06.960 --> 20:07.960
To what?

20:07.960 --> 20:08.960
You guys got my key?

20:08.960 --> 20:09.960
Your pig farm?

20:09.960 --> 20:13.340
Your very ominous pig farm.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.300
We do also have his key to return to him.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.860
We told him that we would do this.

20:17.860 --> 20:18.860
Yeah.

20:18.860 --> 20:19.860
Hey Leo, that's why we're here.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.060
We're bringing you your key back.

20:21.060 --> 20:23.100
I'll be right out.

20:23.100 --> 20:29.320
So you wait a second after the phone call ends and his beat up old truck comes driving

20:29.320 --> 20:33.440
down the road and goes up to the other side of the gate and he gets out of the truck

20:33.440 --> 20:37.400
and walks up, kind of leans over the gate and he's still, he's wearing those overalls

20:37.400 --> 20:41.160
and they're covered in shit and he's got no shirt on underneath it.

20:41.160 --> 20:48.240
He's got one of the overalls, unstrapped, all sexy like, and uh, he leans over and he's

20:48.240 --> 20:49.240
like, all right.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.240
It's like piggy couture.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.320
You got my key?

20:54.320 --> 20:55.320
Oh boy.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.160
Can't nail this voice down.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.160
What's happening?

21:00.000 --> 21:05.220
And cut and you got my key?

21:05.220 --> 21:06.220
And one more.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.000
You got my key?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Let's try it.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Let's try a funny one.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
I'm so angry.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
You got my key.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Sad.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
One more time.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I think you nailed this.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I've got my key.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
No, Leo.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
Actually we do.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
That's why we're here.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.600
Oh, I like that back now.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
Can we come in?

21:21.600 --> 21:24.160
Could you put on some tea for us Leo?

21:24.160 --> 21:25.160
We'd like to talk.

21:25.800 --> 21:31.840
If you want to give me my key and then we could say bye, that'd be best case scenario

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
for me.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.680
Well, Leo, that makes me want to talk to you even more.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.800
Well, I'm a fun boy to talk to, but I just like my key.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
Yeah.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.200
Let's, uh, let us in here.

21:44.200 --> 21:50.300
We'll, we'll get you your key once we settle down and, and, and y'all stay right there

21:50.300 --> 21:53.720
and I'll reach my hand over this fence here, which I'm doing now.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.720
Put your hands up.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.720
Oh geez.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.720
Okay.

21:57.720 --> 22:02.320
So now he's horrified and he puts his hands straight in the air and he's like, what?

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
We're all good here.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.120
Let's just go back to your house.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.120
Let's sit down.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
Let's have a drink.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.600
And we gotta have, we have a few questions.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
I'll be right back.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Okay.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
Well we hop over the gate.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
Yeah.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.600
We come in.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.400
Oh, he comes back on his cell phone and he's like, George, George, the police are here

22:19.400 --> 22:23.320
and they hopped over the fence, but I don't think you should, they should be here.

22:23.320 --> 22:27.640
They just came to return my key and now they're on the property.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.680
So yeah, that actually, that we probably fucked up there.

22:29.680 --> 22:35.400
If you could, if you could come down here and then he listens for a second and he's

22:35.400 --> 22:41.920
like, Oh, warrant, warrant, warrant and or probable cause warrant.

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
Yeah.

22:42.920 --> 22:47.520
Our probable cause is a dead body and you having a pig farm and it was on the dead body

22:47.520 --> 22:49.120
was on your property.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.320
There's a dead body on my property.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.320
You knew this.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.400
We told you this last night.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.260
I'm angry at this guy right now.

22:56.260 --> 23:02.040
I don't know him very well and he's not following my city cop orders and I'm kind of mad at

23:02.040 --> 23:03.040
him.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.160
So I'm going to step in the middle and try and diffuse the situation.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.600
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.320
Hey, hey, uh, Keith, hang on, hang on a second.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.600
Hey, I've got my hand on my gun and I'm looking at it.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.600
Leo.

23:14.600 --> 23:15.600
Uh, I'm sorry.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.200
We, we kind of bum rush you right here like this.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.760
Uh, it's just, we've got a, we're all pretty hungover.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.200
We got a pretty strong case going here.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.560
That's uh, it's real messed up, but uh, there's a chance that Julie Maxwell's caught up in

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
something here.

23:27.560 --> 23:29.880
We found out that you had a restraining order against her.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.800
We just wanted to know what that was about.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
Yeah.

23:32.800 --> 23:33.800
What's up with Julie Maxwell?

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
What an elegant way to put it.

23:34.800 --> 23:42.080
I just don't, you know, that was the past and it's over and I, and she's, she's fine

23:42.080 --> 23:45.320
now and everything, I did everything fine.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
I'm fine.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.320
No, no.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.520
We know you got the restraining order against her.

23:49.520 --> 23:50.520
We know that.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.520
Yeah.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.640
We just wondered what was the cause of all that?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.800
It was because she thought I'd done killed her sister.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.120
Why did she think that you killed her sister?

23:58.120 --> 24:01.200
I accidentally, huh.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.620
Wait, would we know about this case?

24:04.620 --> 24:09.120
Go ahead and roll, uh, not you Keith, but the other two who are in town.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.440
If you want to roll law.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.440
Yeah.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
54 and a 50.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.440
Oh, bummer.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.440
Uh, 29 on a 60.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.440
Oh, awesome.

24:15.440 --> 24:24.400
Uh, Clark Bishop, you would remember roughly 15 and a half years ago or so Leo piston,

24:24.400 --> 24:32.200
uh, was involved in a manslaughter case for the death of Julie Maxwell's younger sister.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
He did a year in juvie.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.480
Wait, how old was he at the time?

24:35.480 --> 24:36.640
He was 16.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.920
How old is he right now?

24:37.920 --> 24:41.120
Well, that was about, yeah, he's like 32.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.160
Were you just testing his math?

24:44.160 --> 24:50.040
I was thinking of Leo is like a 60 year old man.

24:50.040 --> 24:54.040
So that no, I definitely did not think this Leo.

24:54.040 --> 24:58.480
You look a little worse for where I think this Julie business has been, it's been way

24:58.480 --> 24:59.480
in on you.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.320
I've been, I'm been good and I've been good and everything's been fine.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.080
Does Clark remember the sister's name?

25:05.080 --> 25:12.400
Uh, her sister's name was, uh, it was, uh, well, Ashley boom.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.480
Does Clark connect the dots?

25:16.480 --> 25:20.640
As soon as he hears Leo say that, would I have been like, Oh yeah, the Maxwell girls,

25:20.640 --> 25:21.640
like, did I know them?

25:21.640 --> 25:25.480
You wouldn't, it was kind of a big deal, but that was 15 years ago and a lot, you know,

25:25.480 --> 25:26.480
a lot of stuff happened.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.440
A lot of clinkers between then and now.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.940
A lot of TV dinners.

25:29.940 --> 25:33.680
They were going for a second degree, which is a cop.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.680
I of course know means.

25:36.680 --> 25:47.480
Well, obviously as a cop manslaughter law and order has taught us is when some somebody's

25:47.480 --> 25:50.320
dead, but you didn't mean nothing.

25:50.320 --> 25:56.580
Second degree murder is any intentional murder with malice, a forethought, but is not premeditated

25:56.580 --> 25:57.580
or planned.

25:57.580 --> 25:58.580
Hmm.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.580
A crime of passion.

25:59.580 --> 26:03.280
We're in a pretty heated moment in world right now.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.280
Definitely.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.000
All these memories are flooding into your brain.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.140
Clark Leo immediately just throws his hands into his overalls like kind of childlike hands

26:14.140 --> 26:15.140
in his shirt.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.400
Luke, I think you said Keith Vigna has his hand on his gun.

26:18.400 --> 26:23.980
Yeah, I have my hand on my gun, but also I can sense the little relationship that Clark

26:23.980 --> 26:25.360
and him have going on.

26:25.360 --> 26:29.000
So I moved my hand from my gun to my taser.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.520
Keith, Keith, there's no need for that.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.680
I looked, I'm looking straight at Leo.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.080
Leo's a good boy.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.760
I'm a good, I'm a good, I'm a good, I'm a good boy.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.760
He's a good boy to talk to.

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
I'm a good boy.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.800
Let's go back to your house and let's talk about this.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
No, it's fine.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
It's fine.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.800
No, we can talk.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
We can talk right here.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
We can talk right here at this gate.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
I turned to Keith.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
Hey, Keith.

26:48.800 --> 26:56.960
I forgot that I knew all about this restraining order that Ashley girl, that happened right

26:56.960 --> 26:59.080
around when I joined up with the force.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.680
It was, it was a bad time.

27:00.680 --> 27:05.000
I ease my grip up on my taser, but I'm still kind of hovering.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
I turn back to Leo.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Leo.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
I'm sorry we brought all that up.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.520
It's just, we've got a, we've got a real sticky case here.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.520
Sticky?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.520
Hairy.

27:12.520 --> 27:16.080
Hey Leo though, have you had any contact with Julie in the past few weeks?

27:16.080 --> 27:17.080
No, no.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.080
She stayed away.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.080
She stayed away.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.760
She hasn't, she hasn't reached out to you recently?

27:20.760 --> 27:21.760
No.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.800
I think with that information that you had before, you would know that the, her sister

27:25.800 --> 27:28.760
died on December 1st, 15 years ago.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.000
So wait, this is the anniversary or the day after?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.560
Yesterday was the anniversary.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.560
Wow.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.560
Bad day for her parents.

27:34.560 --> 27:40.840
I look, I look right at Leo and I go, do you know anyone that drives a white Honda Toyota?

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
A white Honda Toyota?

27:41.840 --> 27:44.920
A white Toyota Honda Accord Civic.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.000
Leo, you know anybody in town who has a white Toyota?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.160
Leo, do you know anybody that drives a, is it a Toyota?

27:50.160 --> 27:51.160
Yeah.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
Do you know anybody?

27:52.160 --> 27:53.160
Sorry.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.160
No, it's really funny.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.480
No, this is definitely the guy you should ask about this.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.480
Do you know anybody in town?

27:58.480 --> 28:01.480
Leo, where's the chief?

28:01.480 --> 28:07.480
Hey, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a good detective.

28:07.480 --> 28:11.480
Leo, do you know anybody in town that drives a white Toyota?

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
What?

28:12.480 --> 28:13.480
Don't.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.480
Why are you changing that?

28:14.480 --> 28:19.280
My hand goes back to my taser.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.760
Tell me if you know anybody that drives a white Toyota.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.000
I don't know anybody that drives a white Toyota.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.920
How can I believe you?

28:27.920 --> 28:28.920
Roll human.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.120
That's exactly how I get it.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.120
Yeah.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
There's mechanics for that.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.120
I got a 74.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.120
On a what?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
On an 80.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.120
Oh, for real?

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
For real.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
Okay.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
Damn.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
He, he is scared.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.720
He is very, very scared.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.400
Is there an intimidate roll that I can do?

28:45.400 --> 28:46.480
Leo, I'm really sorry.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.120
We are not our best today.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.120
We're a little unfocused.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.560
Can I have my key back?

28:50.560 --> 28:54.480
We frankly don't know why we're here.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.480
I just want my key.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.480
It just seemed like the right thing to do.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.840
I just want my key back.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.600
We're going to need that for a couple more days probably.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
What happened?

29:01.600 --> 29:04.000
Well, we were hoping you could fill in some blanks earlier.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.440
I just came out last night and brought y'all the key and then I left and y'all said something

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
bad happened.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
What happened?

29:10.440 --> 29:14.040
Hey, I know it didn't have a face and all, but did you recognize that body laying in

29:14.040 --> 29:15.040
your garbage yard?

29:15.040 --> 29:16.040
There was a what?

29:16.040 --> 29:17.960
And he immediately gets back on the phone.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
Did he?

29:18.960 --> 29:20.120
Did we not?

29:20.120 --> 29:24.600
My taser is unholstered.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.720
He turns around and he's like walking back towards his truck.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.920
George, George, there was a body found at the junkyard.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.180
Yeah, I don't know.

29:33.180 --> 29:34.180
I don't know.

29:34.180 --> 29:35.180
I come up behind Leo.

29:35.180 --> 29:38.120
Hey Leo, is that George on the phone there?

29:38.120 --> 29:39.120
Yeah.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.120
Would you mind if I talked to him?

29:41.120 --> 29:48.120
Okay, George, I'm going to give the phone to Clark Bishop, the chief man, the cop police.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.640
And he hands you the phone.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.160
Hey, George.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.160
It's Clark.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.160
Hey.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.160
Hi.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.160
Yeah, this is me.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.160
I'm George.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.160
We're up here.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.160
We're returning your brother's key to the lot.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.160
Yeah.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.160
Will you stop giving him so much trouble and give him the key?

30:01.160 --> 30:02.160
Yeah.

30:02.160 --> 30:06.360
I got to tell you though, George, we found a body last night out there at the yard.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.960
Yeah, that's what Leo just said.

30:09.960 --> 30:10.960
What kind of body?

30:10.960 --> 30:13.000
Are you talking a weirdly coyote?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Talking coyotes?

30:14.000 --> 30:17.400
No, it's a human body.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.200
We found a dead woman on your property.

30:19.760 --> 30:20.760
The fuck you did?

30:20.760 --> 30:21.760
What?

30:21.760 --> 30:26.240
Yeah, so we've got some questions for you and your brother.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.240
Is there a time you guys can meet us down at the station?

30:28.240 --> 30:30.680
Yeah, I suppose we can make that happen.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.640
Gosh, does it have to be today?

30:33.640 --> 30:34.640
Preferably, yeah.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.400
As he's talking, I'm poking him on the arm like, I want to talk.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.120
We'll meet you there around five.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
Does that work?

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
Yeah, that sounds good.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.120
All right.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.120
Now will you give my brother his key back?

30:45.120 --> 30:46.120
Of course.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.120
Get off our property please.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
We're heading out of here right now.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
What does he say?

30:50.040 --> 30:51.040
What does he say?

30:51.040 --> 30:52.040
I want to talk to him.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.040
Let me talk to him.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
I put him back on with Leo.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.040
What does he say?

30:55.040 --> 30:56.040
Yeah, he's going to come in and talk to us.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.360
Don't need to give him any time to talk to each other and plan something out.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
I want to talk to him right now.

30:59.360 --> 31:04.440
A smart thing to do as RPG players, but probably a bad thing to do as cops would be to have

31:04.440 --> 31:06.280
made a copy of that key.

31:06.280 --> 31:12.880
Well, you know, hindsight is a crit success.

31:12.880 --> 31:17.220
Hindsight screwed the pitch, bro.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.340
It's like three o'clock or so, right?

31:19.340 --> 31:20.340
Yeah, it's like three o'clock.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.620
So it's only a couple hours.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.420
If you're concerned about it, we could watch the house.

31:24.420 --> 31:26.460
Keith Vigna is very suspicious.

31:26.460 --> 31:27.460
I'm going to stay here.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.660
I'm going to stay here and make sure they don't leave before they go to the PD.

31:30.660 --> 31:31.660
Okay, for sure.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.180
Do you give Leo his key back?

31:33.180 --> 31:34.180
Okay, cool.

31:34.180 --> 31:36.460
As soon as he gets it, he gets it back on the key ring.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.580
As I'm handing it over, I'm like, so I'm sorry about this, Leo.

31:38.580 --> 31:41.900
I know it was real, real frightening, but we just had to figure some stuff out.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.900
We're all good though now.

31:42.900 --> 31:43.900
We're good?

31:43.900 --> 31:44.900
Yeah.

31:44.900 --> 31:45.900
You and your brother are going to come down and talk.

31:45.900 --> 31:46.900
You'll have him there.

31:47.580 --> 31:51.300
And hopefully over the course of the day, we all get a lot more focused and disciplined.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.300
I believe in you.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.300
I bet y'all can do it.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.700
Really get our heads straight on what we're trying to do here.

31:56.700 --> 32:01.260
I really bet y'all have direction and purpose in all of your decisions.

32:01.260 --> 32:04.120
Leo, you are nothing short of an angel.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.980
And you, sir, are my wings.

32:05.980 --> 32:09.380
All right, I'll see you at clinkers, buddy.

32:09.380 --> 32:14.420
While I stay here, I want to find somewhere that I can hide out, that I can see the entrance,

32:14.420 --> 32:16.860
but I don't want them to know that I stayed behind.

32:16.860 --> 32:17.860
Okay.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.940
Is there like a tree line close or like-

32:19.940 --> 32:22.360
Are you doing this to hide to see if they talk to each other?

32:22.360 --> 32:23.360
They live together?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.360
No.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.360
Which we also knew.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.940
In my mind, I knew that they lived together all the time.

32:28.940 --> 32:34.820
I just, I wanted to see the comings and goings and kind of like try to be a little spy.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.460
Can I roll something besides stealth?

32:36.460 --> 32:38.500
You can roll law.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.980
That's a 30 on a 40.

32:39.980 --> 32:40.980
Oh, nice.

32:40.980 --> 32:43.860
So yeah, you can find a nice spot where you would be able to keep an eye on their comings

32:43.860 --> 32:45.980
and goings.

32:45.980 --> 32:47.940
Tell me how much I can get away with here.

32:47.940 --> 32:55.740
I get into my car and I pull it into a little clearing in the woods and my car is hidden,

32:55.740 --> 33:00.860
but I'm standing outside of my car, eyes scanning for now, because I think what I'm going to

33:00.860 --> 33:02.480
do is do a little walk around.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.480
For sure.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.480
Sounds good.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.480
Cool.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.480
Thomas and Joe, what do you guys want to do?

33:06.480 --> 33:08.700
Probably I'm heading back to the station to get ready for the interview.

33:08.700 --> 33:09.700
Okay, cool.

33:09.700 --> 33:13.820
When I get to the station, I'm probably looking at any updates as far as maybe the information

33:13.820 --> 33:18.180
from the hospital about Julie, maybe checking in with Drew about the chief, all that kind

33:18.180 --> 33:19.180
of stuff.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.860
Okay, so when you get back to the police station-

33:20.860 --> 33:22.860
I want to read the chief's journals.

33:22.860 --> 33:24.220
Okay, sounds good.

33:24.220 --> 33:29.260
You would know from working with Chief Maggie Cook that she always carried a blue notebook

33:29.260 --> 33:30.660
with her everywhere she went.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.460
What was the color of the notebook that Drew gave her?

33:33.460 --> 33:35.980
Yellow was the color of the notebook that was gifted.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.200
The blue one is on her desk.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.380
The yellow one is not in her office.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.020
A red leather notebook and a yellow leather notebook?

33:43.020 --> 33:46.460
I was thinking more of like, Zach, what's your favorite Bourne Ruffins album?

33:46.460 --> 33:51.220
And why is it red, yellow, and blue?

33:51.220 --> 33:53.640
There are three colors that these notebooks come in.

33:53.640 --> 33:57.980
The third is red and there is not a red notebook in this office.

33:57.980 --> 34:01.020
The blue notebook is a day-by-day journal of sorts.

34:01.020 --> 34:04.580
It has to-do lists, grocery lists, and random thoughts.

34:04.580 --> 34:09.140
It's basically her notepad app for a phone, but it's physical copies she carries around

34:09.140 --> 34:10.140
everywhere she goes.

34:10.140 --> 34:11.460
Oh my God, Zach.

34:11.460 --> 34:16.940
It's basically her notepad app for her phone, but she carries it around physically.

34:16.940 --> 34:17.940
It's her notepad.

34:17.940 --> 34:19.940
Yeah, that's what I said.

34:19.940 --> 34:20.940
Dog.

34:20.940 --> 34:21.940
Cat.

34:21.940 --> 34:27.100
What are we doing?

34:27.100 --> 34:32.180
Millennial trash.

34:32.180 --> 34:37.460
It is dated on the front and then a dash and no end date on it, but the first date is like

34:37.460 --> 34:39.940
November 3rd or something like that.

34:39.940 --> 34:44.460
So this is since November 3rd to December 1st are her notes.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.820
And it fills up like three quarters of this notebook.

34:46.820 --> 34:47.820
Chief is thorough.

34:47.820 --> 34:48.820
She's very thorough.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.820
She's very good at her job.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.620
But most of what's in there is notes about her job.

34:52.620 --> 34:55.540
Clark Bishop, as you sit down, what were you looking into?

34:55.540 --> 35:01.140
Seeing if we got anything back about Julie in the hospital about her death and all that

35:01.140 --> 35:02.140
stuff.

35:02.140 --> 35:03.140
Oh yeah.

35:03.140 --> 35:08.660
The hospital actually called and this is the craziest thing, but they heard screaming coming

35:08.660 --> 35:13.820
from the morgue and it turns out that Julie Maxwell pronounced dead.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.060
Not actually dead.

35:15.060 --> 35:16.060
Yeah.

35:16.060 --> 35:22.040
They, somebody did it wrong and how can you live without a face?

35:22.040 --> 35:29.260
So you say to yourself as you're in the office reading a notebook runs down my spot.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.980
This face stuff is really getting to John Lee.

35:31.980 --> 35:33.860
Pettymore values his face.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.000
Is it drew?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
She in the city.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.220
This is the hospital in the city.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:38.780 --> 35:39.780
I'll head that way.

35:39.780 --> 35:40.780
You guys want to talk to my mom?

35:40.780 --> 35:41.780
Yes.

35:41.780 --> 35:42.780
Put her on air.

35:42.780 --> 35:43.780
Hey mom.

35:43.780 --> 35:44.780
Hello.

35:44.780 --> 35:45.780
Are you going to have time for dinner or not?

35:45.780 --> 35:46.780
If you don't, that's fine.

35:46.780 --> 35:47.780
No.

35:47.780 --> 35:53.740
Uh, so right now you're on speakerphone with Zach, Thomas and Joe and millions of listeners

35:53.740 --> 35:54.740
across the nation.

35:54.740 --> 35:55.740
Hi guys.

35:55.740 --> 35:56.740
Hello.

35:56.740 --> 35:57.740
Hi.

35:57.740 --> 35:58.740
How are ya?

35:58.740 --> 35:59.740
Good.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.740
What did you make for dinner?

36:00.740 --> 36:02.740
Um, Texas Roadhouse was going to make us a stay.

36:02.740 --> 36:03.740
Hell yeah.

36:03.740 --> 36:07.220
And I would, I would love to come, but I am.

36:07.220 --> 36:12.420
I bet I'm playing the game with them and we're recording it for a podcast right now.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.780
So am I going to get to be in the podcast?

36:15.780 --> 36:16.780
Yeah.

36:16.780 --> 36:18.460
Here, let's find a good level for you.

36:18.460 --> 36:19.840
Say something spooky.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
Say something spooky.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.840
Dragons are scary.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.840
Dragons are scary.

36:51.840 --> 37:01.840
I'm the only one trying to fool.

37:01.840 --> 37:11.840
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

37:11.840 --> 37:25.840
I'm the only one trying to fool.
