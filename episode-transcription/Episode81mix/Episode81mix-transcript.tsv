0	5920	What's up everybody, I'm Zach, this is Pretending to be People, and Black Lives Matter.
5920	9600	Thanks to the generosity of so many of you supporting us on Patreon,
9600	16080	we were able to match donations this week up to $1500 in support of The Bail Project,
16080	21040	which is a national revolving bail fund on a mission to combat mass incarceration and
21040	26560	reshape the pretrial system in the United States. We chose this group specifically because this
26560	33440	money will support those in our country who are protesting systemic racism and police brutality.
33440	38960	These people are begging for justice, and we support their fight. We were absolutely
38960	46480	elated by the response from this community. Y'all raised $1500 in just 15 hours. Incredible.
46480	53200	As of this recording, together we have raised $3600 for The Bail Project. Let's keep this
53200	58960	thing going. For every $5 donated, you'll receive an entry for a chance to win one
58960	65040	of the first official PTBP shirts. There will be five winners, the first of which
65040	72640	will be announced right now. Brendan DiPinto, congratulations, you just won
72640	78400	a Pretending to be People shirt. Boom, four more to go. You can find the link to donate in the
78400	85680	show notes. And while I don't think saying Black Lives Matter is a political statement,
85680	91840	what is a political statement is this, please register to vote. The presidential election is
91840	97680	five months away, and it is very likely that two seats on the Supreme Court will be filled by
97680	105040	whoever wins. This is not the time for third party candidates or write-ins. If Donald Trump wins
105040	110320	again, the Supreme Court will have a 7-2 conservative majority, which I believe will
110320	116960	lead to inhumane restrictions on abortion, disgusting removal of LGBTQIA plus rights,
116960	122640	absurdly loose gun control, furthering of the corporatocracy, and the continuation of the
122640	129360	death penalty. Fuck all of that, and fuck Donald Trump. Back to you, Wolf the Dog.
129440	135760	Top of the morning to you, pupperinos. It's your toilet diving canine, Wolf the Dog,
135760	144080	and I'm back stroking like Michael Phelps all up in y'all's toilet water live from 694.2 PTBP.
144640	149920	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Matt Fagel, who tweeted about the show and tagged
149920	157440	that pretending pod. They right. I'd like to send love and support to my hometown of Minneapolis.
157440	163360	I don't live there anymore, but I'm so fucking proud of them for standing up the way they have.
163360	169120	My old friends, classmates, and neighbors have been taking care of each other and refusing to
169120	175680	back down. They could now give masterclasses in crisis management to any other city in the
175680	182960	country. It's scary times, but I'm so damn proud of them. Damn, baby Matt. I'm proud of you for
182960	189760	sending this in the internet mail, and I'm proud of any who stand up to those who would diminish
189760	196240	the freedoms of others. Wolf bless you, Matt, and Wolf bless you all for the work y'all are doing
196240	203040	out there on the front lines, the back lines, and lines we don't even know about. We all fight
203040	209440	battles in our own ways, but what's important is that we keep on battling for a better future

272640	280320	mustard, it's time to catch up with the news. Last time in the fucked up puddle-filled ghost town of
280320	287760	contention, Keith Vigna finally collected his $3 from Terrence Liquor, who was out collecting
287760	296640	for daddy with Luca Fade Fadswigs. They had a picture of Keith Vigna in liquor's truck with
296640	303360	a note that said, collect alive. John Lee Pettymore the third has ooze just dripping
303360	311840	constantly out of every orifice in his head. Keith saw this, lost his shit, accidentally shot Fade in
311840	318320	the dome and threatened John with the same if he didn't get back in the truck's waterbed.
318320	324640	Randy Angst isn't who the boys remember him being. Randy's cane had a Rubik's Cube on the
324640	331600	grip instead of a big tooth like Clark remembered because Randy isn't a dentist. He runs the
331600	339600	Children's Museum of Mathematics and Randy didn't remember fighting any sort of android robot man.
339600	346880	This baron stain on my memory has me all baron steamed up and ready for some mother
346880	353360	creatin' father fuckin' kudzu with no backbone.
369600	387920	Hello everyone and welcome to pretending to be people. I am Zach and I am here with Luke
387920	395200	and Thomas and Joe. How is everyone doing this evening? Doing good, how you doing my bud? Good.
395920	396720	You feeling all right?
399360	407280	I got rid of it all. Our boy just revealed in a flurry of a hat pull a shaved head baby.
408720	412560	Whoa wow so I uh yeah I was definitely on another screen.
417200	418800	Oh it looks like something.
419680	427680	Yeah you should go you should go maybe less on the parts that are still here.
429360	432560	I've got a lot on the sides. You do.
437360	444000	You've got a nice hat collection that's for sure. Hell yeah I do. It's a good shine on the top
444080	449440	there I dig that. Yeah thank you thank you. We're getting towards the mirror you know but I want
449440	454320	when we finally hit that Patreon level to where I get hair plugs I want people to fucking know.
456480	459920	Yeah it's a mark of success for sure.
463440	467680	Have you guys uh pulled the trigger on any uh things that you've been thinking
467680	472960	about for a while during this quarantine? Yeah I did the I did a bidet I bought a bidet
472960	476080	that's 100% the thing that I never would have done before this quarantine.
479120	482480	I gotta tell you though I don't exactly know what it's all cracked up to be because I was
482480	488880	brushing my teeth just fine without it. Does it help a little bit with that though? If I get my
488880	495280	mouth right on it it helps a little. How is it so far though? Uh for real I dig it it works.
495280	501920	Did wait so you did you get it specifically to avoid the toilet paper issue? Uh not directly
502000	506880	but it's because like Twitter was blowing up with people talking about how much they love their
506880	512640	bidets because they weren't in the throes of the toilet paper mayhem so I saw a bunch of feedback
512640	516160	about how much people loved them so I thought I'd try one. Well I can't wait to try it out
516160	524640	sometime. I don't want my own I just want to try yours. Even if I don't have to poop I'll try it.
525120	529360	Yeah can does it work when you're standing? I can get I can get real far away from it yeah.
535120	540240	Thomas Luke life normal. Same old shit. Well if you get a bidet yeah then you'll have something
540240	545120	to talk about on this goddamn podcast. And you won't have the same old shit. It will be new
545120	552000	shit yeah if I get a bidet. I'm sorry listeners that I haven't done anything uh interesting with
552000	558000	my butt this quarantine. Wait really though like you're not experimenting or anything?
559120	563840	With like yeah home hemorrhoid remedies but nothing else. Yeah I think I have hemorrhoids
563840	570720	I've developed hemorrhoids from sitting so much no joke. Welcome to the club I believe the
570720	577680	Preparation H wipes are my go-to personally. You can keep yours in Taylor's purse too if you want
577760	580720	uh it works for when you're on the go. Thanks.
583120	585360	Tell her thank you. Hemorrhoids are dope.
588320	590240	I've been coloring my own toilet paper.
594400	600080	And with that let's kick into gear Clark Bishop just tackled Randy Anx through the door of his
600080	609120	own house into the foyer of the angst home while Keith Vigna is standing over Terrence T. Licker.
609120	617360	Terrence Elizabeth Licker who is on the ground below him. The corpse of Luca Fade Fudgevitz is
617360	625680	leaning up against the garage door and bleeding down the driveway of the angst home while John
625680	632480	Lee Pettymore the Thirth is in the back of the truck that is in the driveway along with his
633040	641280	soul's cousin or his mind's cousin but his body's nephew Jimmy Sanders and I believe where we left
641280	649200	off Keith Vigna was hollering. I was ordering John to get back in the water. Yeah and he did
649200	657040	if I recall. Yeah and he did indeed. Oh no Mr. Sir Bishop please I don't and his head is just
657040	666240	like slamming into the linoleum of the entryway of this old home. Oh god no I just. Clark is starting
666240	672880	to calm down some that he has slammed this old man into the ground so hard and feeling bad about it.
672880	677520	He starts to he starts to come to his senses and and maybe recoils and panic a little bit and kind
677520	684320	of backs out the door leaving him on the ground. Oh no why did you came in? As the door closes
684320	687840	behind you as you go back in. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Randy I'm sorry
688480	695760	I'm sorry. And you exit out the door back into the front yard of Randy Yanks home where you back
695760	700880	up into Keith Vigna. I uh my back hits you and your gun is still pointed at John right? Yeah.
701840	704240	I look over at him is he looking normal to me?
706880	715440	No man. I mean I mean his face is white and his hands are red from the blood that is rushed to
715440	720960	his fingertips as he's been using his hands to jostle this old man's head into the floor.
722240	727280	But other than that he's good to go. Yeah he's probably like crying and shit but he's fine. Okay
727280	733040	I look back at John as he like dunks underneath the water when he comes back up what do I see?
733040	744800	He doesn't. He's laying low for a little bit. I look at Clark. John had the ooze all coming out
744800	749440	of him all over him coming out of him. I had to get him in the water. You just saw it just now?
749440	753680	I just saw it. I told him to get in the water. What were you doing right before
753680	759440	that right before you saw it happen? Uh well I kind of gesture over to
760480	765920	Luca. Oh my oh my god. I kind of freaked out there for a second. You fucking saw him man you sawed
765920	774400	him. You got another body T. Keith did you did you did you did you kill him did you kill him?
774400	781600	I kind of I lost control for a second and yeah I tried to I tried to kill him and I shot at
781600	786000	Terrence and I shot at Jimmy. Clark wants to start as he's explaining reaching out to try and
786000	792480	pull the gun down lower to the ground so it's not pointed at anything right now. Yeah I'd let it
792480	799440	happen. Terrence Liger is backing up like into the the house. He's like trying to get into Randy's
799440	810480	house. Clark make sure he doesn't get away. Hey hey Terrence you stay you stay out here we don't
810480	815520	want you going in there with Randy. He just like leans up against the door on the ground still he's
815520	822320	like scooched backwards crab crawl and then he leans up against the front door and there's a
822320	828400	shot where you can see in the foreground you've got Terrence Liger leaning up against the front
828400	836880	door and in the background you've got a dead fade leaning up against the garage door. John you in
836880	842000	there? Before any we do any of that who the you're gonna have to remind me who Fade was
842640	850960	and Terrence Liger. It was Rocky Balboa was Fade. Hey Luca Fajovitz. Hey I'm Luca. Hey everybody
850960	857520	calls me Fade. He's a little guy he's really wide he was a bodybuilder and he was sent to collect
857520	868240	alongside Terrence Licker who owns Lickers Lickers Lickers and he has had beef with Keith Vigna but
868240	873360	I think it's been solved with three dollars of that three single dollars right they were sent
873360	883360	to collect Randy Yanks by the church by Pastor Adam Kane. Now go Joe. John you in there you can
883360	889360	come out. John cautiously pokes his head up and and looks around this is a pickup truck right
889360	896000	with water in the bed so he you just see his eyes like come up above the bed and he kind of scopes
896000	901600	it out and he he ducks down you can't see his eyes anymore but you can still see um the top
901600	906800	of his head. I got Keith to put the gun down you you can you can come up. Clark he he when I saw
906800	911200	his eyes he didn't have he didn't have goo coming out of him anymore I think the water worked.
911200	916160	Keith says Keith says you're all right now. Yeah okay you got the gun from him he's not gonna.
916160	921200	I've got the gun in my hand but I'm not pointing it at you anymore. Gun is down and he seems to be
921200	926160	uh clear-eyed and clear-headed at this point I don't I don't know. I holster my gun and walk
926160	929920	back and put my hands up a little bit. He's holstering his gun and walking back with his
929920	935680	hands up a little bit. Don't get that guy he's crazy man he's crazy you can't get him out of
935680	941920	there leave him in there let's go let's bail. Go where? I don't I mean we need to get you
942480	948720	to the F C F C that way we can save the world right like you are our prince. I don't think
948720	954240	that's gonna be happening. Uh what's the F C F C F C the was it the first church of contention?
954240	959440	The first kreek family is contented. First kreek right first kreek family? First kreek family
959440	963920	contention you know we're just a big family we're trying to go back and save the world but we need
964720	970160	we need bodies and we need peace. You guys you guys of all people should want to go buy it we
970160	975520	we're you're out here trying to trying to save everything but we have a plan to save everything
975520	980800	so I don't understand why you're fighting against it you can help we can save the world together.
980800	986960	It's just your plans has not been clearly enunciated to us and uh also the fact that
986960	992480	you need bodies and our friend is a little weird but our friend did just create a body.
993040	998880	Yeah you can take Luca back and have that and that's our little gift to you and we'll think
998880	1003440	about giving you Keith maybe later. Well and I think we're gonna end up back at the church
1003440	1008960	we're just it's not our first stop yet we got other stuff to do to help. Well you certainly
1008960	1014480	didn't seem like you're helping earlier I mean are you even on the side of daddy? We don't know.
1015120	1022480	I want to say yeah but yeah we don't know yet I mean yeah we are yeah we gotta go somewhere
1022480	1028320	get some more fish and water to help out first. We know but we're good on fish and water. No there
1028320	1034640	was a it turns out there was a leak yeah late breaking news you probably haven't heard about
1034640	1040480	it since you got sent out but there was a big old leak in a bunch of the fish uh plumb dried up
1040480	1046800	there they spilled into the end of the out of the out of the wall of water and into a parking lot
1046800	1054720	of a grocery store uh and unfortunately there they uh they were baked uh in the in the daytime sun.
1054720	1059200	Yeah so we need we need we're going we're going to take this truck full of water to go get more
1059200	1063040	fish naturally look we've already got a head start you can see some fishes in there.
1063920	1066480	Everybody go ahead and roll alertness for me.
1071440	1078640	I pass a 42 on a 70. 20 on a 60. Alertness I got a 50 on a 60.
1079520	1086400	Everyone succeeds the ground is kind of vibrating you can hear in the distance
1088000	1092640	the low rumble of vehicles more than one.
1092640	1105760	And it is growing increasingly louder and it is heading in your direction.
1105760	1110400	Boys I what you want to get out of here. I thought I think I think we ought to you feel that.
1110400	1114560	Terrence you you stay here get inside lock yourself in there don't touch
1115120	1118880	anybody or anything and and don't come out till we talk to you again.
1118880	1122480	You leave Randy alone in there too he doesn't want to go with you so you don't get to take
1123200	1126320	order get inside and stay there lock all the doors.
1126320	1132880	He listens to everything you've said and he's like yeah all right and he uh backs up he kind
1132880	1138240	of opens up the door behind him you know behind his back and then he slides through it and you
1138240	1150240	see him slide back on his on his butt and then he kicks the door closed and you hear uh you know
1150240	1156320	how conversation sounds. Right guys I think we should hop in this get back to
1156320	1162000	carry and go to the pond what do you think? I've never even seen a number two without cucumber at
1162000	1167040	a time like this you couldn't fight me to not put oil on a sandwich you hear me because what
1167040	1171120	I'm saying is that and I guess we'll keep we'll keep Jimmy in the back too.
1171120	1175600	Just want to remind you that Jimmy Sanders is still yeah he's just he's all wet so we
1175600	1181200	thought we'd just keep him back here. He's also a uh a goo detector for us if if they're using
1181200	1185120	them the same way we might as well too. John are you gonna stay in the back or are you gonna come
1185120	1190880	get in the cab? Uh I'm pretty wet I should probably stay back here maybe I don't want
1190880	1200160	to make a mess. Okay uh Clark how's are you good at driving? Oh also if nobody is I can drive I
1200160	1207440	guess. Also I'm really wet but I am the best driver. I'd say I'm just below average at driving.
1207440	1212080	I tell you I'm exactly average at it. All right all right move over move over let me show you.
1212080	1214960	It doesn't matter if we get the seats wet it's not our truck anyway.
1216400	1220880	As Clark is walking around the back of the truck he's gonna look in the bed and see those fish
1221440	1228400	and say hey I'll ride back here and jump right in. Okay boys. Hey does Clark does Clark seem to be
1229040	1234160	real interested in all these fish? Yeah he's running his hands over some of them back there
1234160	1238080	and kind of giggling the whole time. He's like a goddamn fish whisperer. He's actually pretty
1238080	1243920	strange. Also sorry I pointed my gun at you but I saw goo coming out of your eyes and all over
1243920	1248960	again I just freaked out. I don't see it anymore but I don't know what happened. Keith you ain't
1248960	1254480	got to apologize for being an irresponsible thank you. I appreciate that. Just take it in stride
1254480	1260720	when you're riding with Keith Vigna. I opened the like back window thing to where we can talk to
1260720	1265360	Clark in the back of the truck. Clark is holding up a trout. They got trout back here man.
1266640	1272240	Sweet uh well if if you're gonna be safe back there what's our next step? Should we go should
1272240	1277360	we go straight to the pond or do we need to get carry? What do you think? Clark drops the fish.
1277920	1283520	I mean we were headed toward the pond kind of independent of the carry thing. Wasn't the carry
1283840	1288400	more of a church thing and we were gonna maybe do that later? Well we got her in the back of the
1288400	1293680	car. We were I thought we were just dropping keeping her there while we went and got my watch
1293680	1298320	but whatever you guys think I don't know. Yeah but then that turned into a whole thing so. Yeah should
1298320	1303200	we just head to the pond and leave her be? Nobody's probably gonna find her. She's shackled up in
1303200	1310240	there. Plus I'm sure this will just be a 15-minute jaunt. That's true. Let's get there. Nothing ever
1310320	1317920	takes too long. No no it never it never takes days or anything so. It's almost like I warned us that
1317920	1323360	this might happen but. All right I gotta go pee. Well we have the opportunity right now to change
1323360	1330640	our fates. All right go pee and I'm gonna look at the map and see what makes sense. We could also
1330640	1335680	not wait until he gets back and just do it so that when he gets back we're already at the pond.
1335680	1340480	Yeah okay we pull up to the pond and then now we gotta wait for him to tell us what to do.
1340480	1344320	Yeah there we go. We've been waiting we described a bunch of stuff that happened. Where are we at?
1344320	1350080	We're at the pond now. Oh sick did you guys see all the really cool stuff on the way there? No
1350080	1359200	we closed our eyes and went. We discovered a new item that lets us teleport. Whoa what was it?
1359200	1364320	It was in Fade's pocket. Yeah it was the keys to the truck and the truck is a teleportation device.
1366640	1371440	Also one thing that happens if you're not inside the teleportation device everything within five
1371440	1377120	miles gets dies so we beat the game too. Yeah good game Zach that was cool. Yeah yeah cool
1377120	1382400	thank you everyone that's been pretending to be people I guess. I hope that was the end you were
1382720	1384480	looking for. Everything's resolved.
1391120	1395760	Thanks bye. So press stop and I'll ask it. Yeah.
1399200	1403280	Just upload it right to Google Drive. Okay. Have a good night guys. Okay.
1412400	1422880	I think that we're leaning toward the idea that we're going to navigate back to our car
1422880	1428480	and try and take it around to the south of the city and come up toward Bean's pond from the
1428480	1433280	south. Yeah yeah that absolutely makes sense. Did you guys just do do do do we want to try and take
1433280	1436960	the truck with us or do it on foot? Let's take the truck. If we take the truck are we gonna have to
1436960	1442000	go by that crane barrier thing? Presumably if we're turning the car around and trying to go
1442000	1449360	somewhere to head south it looks like the road just south of the hotel also leads leads west.
1449360	1455760	East? Yeah east yeah so presumably it's um like go all you're wanting to avoid the barriers so
1455760	1460640	we're talking about turning the car around on the highway. Okay yeah. And then driving somewhere
1460640	1466960	east to get to a longer way around town. Yeah. But you weren't you asking about how to get the truck
1466960	1473200	out though? Right we take it east and take it by the library. Oh gotcha. And then off the map to
1473200	1478880	the side there to wherever we're going to. And then go it actually just pac-mans and you come
1478880	1483120	back through on the west side. Okay then we'll. Oh cool then we just pop straight down.
1485440	1491280	We'll go up until we're down. No but yeah let's do that east until we intersect with the highway
1491280	1499200	go west. Okay. And at that exact moment you see that on each side of the street down on the east
1499200	1505680	and west side of the street of this house heading toward your direction there is just a front half
1505680	1512400	cab of a truck with a trailer on the back with a hot tub situated and strapped in onto the trailer.
1512400	1520800	And then on the other side coming down is a impala and the back has been also tarped into
1520880	1524560	an appropriate. You're thinking of a. No do impalas not have that? You're thinking of an
1524560	1528640	El Camino? You're thinking of an El Camino. I was thinking of an El Camino. Yeah it's still cool.
1528640	1535200	On the other side there is an impala coming down and it has a refrigerator that's strapped to the
1535200	1541280	top of it with its door ripped off then there's someone like inside the refrigerator on top of
1541280	1548000	the impala. Nice. Guys Sam and Dean Winchester are here to save us. Yeah who's who's impala and
1548000	1552800	El Camino are these? Do we recognize them as the vehicles of townsfolk? No longer an El Camino.
1552800	1559200	Just an impala. It's a truck with a trailer and an impala with a refrigerator. Do we recognize
1559200	1566000	the impala? Weirdly enough you guys never you didn't meet a whole lot of people in contention.
1566800	1571440	I mean we're from here though. I don't mean on our time in the podcast I mean in our time
1571440	1582000	spending our entire lives as citizens of this small town. Yeah. Does somebody drive an impala?
1582000	1590640	Uh you know the impala belongs to a very nice couple who live in the suburbs and they are
1590640	1597520	members of the first church of contention and their names are Asher and Avery Little. Nice
1597520	1604080	married couple who recently had two children who are twins. I mean you can try to pull at
1604080	1607360	our heartstrings but it doesn't mean we're not going to start shooting the second these people
1607360	1615920	pull up. There are no strings to pull at my dear sir. So are they blocking us in on this street
1615920	1620640	basically? That is the attempt yes. Well boys what do you want to do? I mean these cars like
1620640	1625200	these vehicles are way cooler and more capable than what we're trying to get so maybe we just
1625200	1631760	take one of theirs. Take both of theirs. You want to try to get that truck then or the fridge
1631760	1637200	doesn't look like it's too stable. Yeah but that's a fucking cherry impala. It's up to you you're
1637200	1643920	driving you go that way and then I pull my gun out and I'll shoot. Wait wait wait what if what
1643920	1648080	if you just hit reverse and we get out of here perpendicular to them both through the through
1648080	1653200	the field? We could I just I kind of wouldn't it be cool to drive that big mad max truck around?
1653200	1656640	I don't want to kill anybody though we've done enough of that today.
1656640	1663280	That's true okay well I punch it in reverse. Okay roll drive. Reversing north and then I want to
1663280	1671280	yeah spin around and head the right way. 59 we're heading back to our car. Okay sounds good you have
1671280	1678320	a couple tails. Are they cutting across the field at us? Okay so as you back up through the yard and
1678320	1683840	the bumps bumps and you hear jimmy sanders in the back just like oh I can't put a needle on that
1683840	1689280	and like water's just like spilling out there's fish flying out you see in the rear view mirror
1689280	1694800	but you you bumble on through and the truck is boom boom boom back and forth and back and forth.
1694800	1699280	Clark you were just like slipping slipping from side to side in this water. Holding on for dear
1699280	1706960	life yeah. And jimmy is too and the two of you are uh I can only imagine is just like the wildest
1706960	1713840	wave pool the tiniest wildest wave pool of two grown ass men inside. Just fish slapping him in
1713840	1723120	the face. So john puts it in reverse um guns it hard says sorry fish he's peeling he's peeling
1723120	1731520	straight back does a sweet e-brake turn full like uh 180 facing the other direction peels out again
1731520	1737280	leaves a bunch of disgusting tire smoke uh in everybody's faces and probably some squished fish
1737280	1745120	oh and it fucking reeks uh as this uh this incredibly bad smell just gets fouled around
1745120	1755440	through the the december cold air of contention and you leave a wake of rancid fish smell in your
1755440	1762080	dust. And now as you hit this road you're coming up along the the road that hotel motel is on.
1762080	1767840	Are you just jumping the curb straight up onto the side road or? Yeah like if it seems feasible
1767840	1773440	I'm just heading straight for the highway again. Kerry pages is our only bargaining chip here.
1773440	1780320	This truck is like what are you just like throwing the axle up into the air every time you
1780480	1787920	hit another hill to jump another curb and go up onto the the side road and then up onto the
1787920	1794320	highway. Thankfully the the metal gate broke away from a crash that happened three years ago it just
1794320	1799280	doesn't exist anymore right there on the exit and so you drive right up onto the highway from the
1799280	1804400	opposite side and you would be driving into oncoming traffic but you can cut across through
1804400	1810480	the median the grass in between two lanes of traffic on the highway and then on to when I
1810480	1813760	said you would be going in oncoming traffic you wouldn't be you'd be on the right side.
1813760	1816080	I was in Britain in my head. Oh fuck off.
1819840	1825920	You've never been to England? Oh yeah Thomas have you never been to England? Cheers mate.
1826880	1828640	Worse I've been to Italy.
1831920	1838160	Cheers mate. I could out obnoxious you in a heartbeat. Well I believe that so you
1838160	1845440	cross the median of the highway. I'm confused about the logistics of the roadblock previously
1845440	1853120	is it just not on this exit or is this? If you're looking at the exit of contention as a T the
1853120	1859680	roadblock would be on the northeast side and you're coming at it from the southeast side and
1859680	1866160	then going way more east. Once we do that we're heading back to our car. Yeah that's where we
1866160	1870000	just went. Did we make it to our car? Here I'll put it to you this way John Lee Pettymore as
1870000	1876720	you're driving on the highway which you would be just off of the exit leading out of contention
1876720	1883040	toward the city as you're on this strip of the highway you see behind you the truck and the
1883040	1889520	El Camino are in pursuit and they're following so you have the option. It's an Impala. Fuck.
1893520	1898960	You have the option to head to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse or to not head to the
1898960	1904720	2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse but currently you have a truck and an Impala on your tail.
1904720	1911200	I head to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse I yell to Clark in the back be ready to grab pages.
1911200	1916400	I kind of swing alongside and have him hop out and then I immediately flip him around
1916400	1923200	and like start driving the truck forward and backwards menacingly near the Mitsubishi. I do
1923200	1927440	that I jump out but as soon as I jump out I start going keys keys keys keys keys I need somebody to
1927440	1931920	and I'm holding my hand up somebody's got to throw me the keys to the trunk. Like an Edgar Wright cut
1931920	1936720	you just see the keys zoom straight into your hands from my pocket.
1936720	1939520	Thomas knows how to have me not call for a check.
1942640	1949440	I get the keys and I pop open the trunk. Boy I hope she's still in there. Yes.
1949440	1952960	Yes.
1954720	1961600	Yes. Sweet. I pulled the body of Drew out and like chuck him into the back of the truck
1962400	1967680	and I get around to the side. Oh wait do we have Tyler with us? No we have him on a leash.
1967680	1972400	He's in the cab. He's in the cab. Yeah we did let him right in front. And I jump back into the back
1972400	1978720	of the pickup. Well here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a check. Their drive versus
1978720	1986080	Clark's. Either athletics or dexterity in order to see if they can arrive in time. I'd like to
1986080	1990800	aid him with my drive as I'm trying to fend them off. I like that. Yeah so you go ahead and roll
1990800	1999840	the drive first. 96. So that's not gonna help uh as you're just spinning out.
2000080	2010640	Oh shit dude. No. 98. Damn. I rolled a crit success. Oh boy. Of course. 44 baby. Oh boy.
2010640	2016400	What happens? Where where in the sequence of events did this did the critical success occur?
2017520	2026080	Exactly. So so I'm imagining that just off the highway there's a slight ditch curved down which
2026080	2032480	is where the 2001 Red Mitsubishi Eclipse is and you're alongside of it and Clark hops out of the
2032480	2038320	truck bed and is like keys keys keys. Toss him the keys. Edgar Wright cut. He runs over. Opens up the
2038320	2046080	trunk. Edgar Wright cut. Drew is inside and as soon as you grab Drew and toss him onto the ground you
2046080	2053760	see above you on the highway in front of you and behind you have pulled up this big truck. Trailer
2053760	2059440	on the back. Hot tub strapped into the back and a cherry Impala with a refrigerator strapped to
2059440	2071040	the top. I have to go pee again so sorry. We uh we blew up the truck and the Impala while you were
2071040	2077440	gone. Sick. Oh man did everyone die? Yeah. Not us though. Yeah we were good. Oh right. We we we got
2077440	2081760	a super jump ability while you were gone also so we just jumped above the explosion and then landed
2081760	2087520	back down. Was there a cool object that gave you super jump ability? Yeah. Well also Tyler Gerwings
2087520	2091760	and we can ride him wherever we want now. That's that's what it was I forgot. Yeah the jump thing
2091760	2095840	was something we proposed but then we decided to just ride Tyler. Yeah. Right. You guys are really
2095840	2101040	good at this. What else happened? Oh we all got a billion dollars. Yeah. And the and the medal of
2101040	2108960	honor. Well that's pretty easy to get these days. Yeah. We got Rush Limbaugh with us now. Oh good.
2108960	2114000	Rush what should we do next? As an Eagles fan and an American. Not a fan.
2116720	2120880	What else happened? The whole zombie subplot we just nipped in the bud. I used to think that
2120880	2125920	that phrase was nipped in the butt. Like you bite its butt. Yeah. Just bite the butt. Yeah just a
2125920	2134880	little nip it in the bud. Was that was that Andy Griffith show? Yeah it was. That was pretty that
2134880	2142160	was pretty solid. What's that dude's name? Don Knotts. Don Knotts that's right. What was the
2142160	2147040	character's name? No I'm totally. Yeah okay fuck off because I was just gonna let it sit there.
2147040	2151120	That was it Barney. Barney. I was just gonna let it sit there because I couldn't remember either.
2151120	2155120	Yeah uh-huh Barney Fife. Barney Fife. Do you think Thomas is pooping?
2155120	2167120	Can everyone hear me? Yeah. Yep and immediately you all hear this
2167120	2172320	hooping and hollering coming from the person who's in the refrigerator on top of the Impala
2172320	2182800	and coming from the hot tub you just hear this and then all of a sudden you hear glass shatter
2182800	2189360	as a body comes flying out of the shotgun side of the truck and it is lifted up in the air
2189360	2195760	and then slammed into the ground. Holy shit just the once? Well we're now in initiative order.
2195760	2200480	Clark it is your turn you are outside of the truck bed and you are outside of the 2001
2200480	2205120	Mitsubishi Eclipse and you have Drew's body with carry pages inside of it on the ground next to
2205120	2210480	you what do you do? I just want to use my turn to hook Drew's body into the back of the truck.
2210480	2215360	Done. Keith what are you doing? Do I recognize the person? It seems to be one of the homeless
2215360	2222240	people they have got the similar vibe as the the homeless people that you were hanging out with
2222240	2227760	just like BFFs with in the back of that school bus. Right can I see who's in the driver's seat
2227760	2234640	of the truck and the Impala? Go ahead and roll uh search. Uh fail. Okay well I already told you
2234640	2241040	you can't see who's driving the truck but you do know that the Impala is the little vehicle and
2241040	2247760	yeah you know you can kind of tell that it's their outlines. Shit I don't know what to do um. Okay
2247760	2254000	Thomas what are you John Lee Pettymore doing? John Lee Pettymore is just like slamming his hand
2254000	2260560	on the side of the truck yelling at Clark to load up and hop in. Very cool uh you guys actually if
2260560	2266560	you're looking around you can see the driver of the truck like climbs out of the window
2266560	2274000	and jumps up into the hot tub in the back. As the driver of the truck is climbing out the window
2274000	2280880	of the cab trying to climb back onto the trailer and get into the hot tub you see he jumps for the
2280880	2287760	hot tub and right before he lands in the water his body is lifted above the hot tub. I need everyone
2287760	2298240	to roll sanity. Oh no. I fail. I fail over my power I think. Let me check. I crit fail but
2298240	2308400	under my power. Motherfucker. Yeah I failed 61 on a 60. I'm at a 55 on a 13. My power is 60.
2308400	2315680	Yeah I rolled over my power 80 on a 13. You can't see the ooze right now? Previous to losing the
2315680	2322560	sanity you only saw the body moving and you don't know where the ooze is? Lose one sanity.
2323680	2329920	You see this guy as he's jumping you see him catch and nothing seems to catch him but he's just like
2329920	2337200	hanging in mid-air and then you see it. You see the ooze that's holding him up in the air and it
2337200	2348320	is a wave and it is the most it is the thickest it is the largest amount the quantity the volume
2348320	2354480	is clearly growing this is the most you've seen in one area and it is holding this guy up in the air
2354480	2362880	as the same mass is slamming the person who is sitting shotgun into the ground as they are folding
2362880	2370800	into this oily substance and the person who is hanging above the hot tub they reach out and
2370800	2377920	they're trying to grab onto the the man who is inside the hot tub and they're they're pulling
2377920	2383760	and they're pulling and they're pulling and then you see the ooze just consumes the person who is
2383760	2389680	hanging in the air and grabs onto the person who is in the hot tub as well lifts them up out of
2389680	2395840	the water and the two who are holding on to each other are then being thwacked thwack thwack kind
2395840	2404400	of like uh what the hulk did to loki yeah that classic gif from the marvel talkies spreading
2404400	2414720	everywhere and with that the impala begins backing up clark bishop what are you doing i am now
2414720	2419360	joining drew and jimmy sanders in the back of the truck done keith vigna what are you doing
2419360	2425840	i'm trying i see that and i try to crawl out the window that's in the back like between the
2425840	2432640	cab and the bed of the truck and i get like my top half of my body out but my big pants get caught
2432640	2439440	so i'm like halfway in and halfway out and i'm grabbing jimmy and trying to hold him underwater
2439440	2444160	while i'm yelling like why are you doing this why are you doing this if he's holding jimmy
2444160	2449520	under the water and i'm back there can like part of my turn be to try and help jimmy not die under
2449520	2453600	the water like i'm trying to get keith off of him but maybe also help keith through the window or
2453600	2459440	something i don't know maybe next turn uh john lee pettymore what are you doing john is is freaking
2459440	2465040	out it's like he's woken up from a bad dream and he sees all of this uh playing out in front of them
2465040	2471680	he sees the wave coming towards them and even though being in this body makes his brain want
2471680	2479200	to vomit he still he recognizes that he's behind the wheel of a vehicle and that like shit is
2479200	2487760	coming and he just like the one thing that he can get through from his brain to his body is is brush
2488320	2495680	yeah he just fucking pedal on the floor peels straight away from the wave in the rear view
2495680	2503440	mirror you just hear bloodcurdling screams and the smell of like that nasty fishy smell just
2503440	2509600	barely kind of tinged behind you as you see the camera is just reversing reversing reversing
2509600	2518640	and then all of a sudden you cut through tree line and you are face to face with this crane that has
2518640	2524720	all these tubes on the end of its payload there and it's ready to lift them up off the ground
2525280	2530000	and there's actually no one there
2532320	2537840	and looking around you see no one maybe they got good if i look behind us do i see is the goo
2538640	2543440	a still there or be giving chase have we driven so far that we're it's it would it would normally
2543440	2547600	be out of sight at this point i don't know what do i see when i look behind me you see the goo
2547600	2553920	is just like racing it's like almost like hands that are inside of it are dragging it across and
2553920	2559040	along the back there's a wave that's coming along the back end and crashing down that's causing more
2559040	2563520	hands that seem to be crawling toward you and then another wave comes around the back and crashes
2563520	2568880	forward and it's just moving slowly but way quicker than you've ever seen it move before
2568880	2577040	so we're rocking seven miles an hour right now but it is steadily just if it had a noise it would be
2577280	2585120	i like the idea of hand waves uh coming out of goo that's really gross and fucked up so cool

2679840	2686000	damn it but now's not the time now look down there ain't that a beansco crane think you could
2686000	2692080	operator well i used to have a toy one of these when i was a kid so yeah you're you're our only
2692080	2700800	hope hey luke what is keith vigna's heavy machinery skill oh my heavy machinery is ten percent
2700800	2704640	tight
2708240	2713200	how far away from the crane are we coming up fast but john lee pettymore the successful drive check
2713200	2720000	could easily maneuver around out of the way of these tubes and continue on the path oh well
2720560	2726800	why don't i just try driving through first i guess but you got me pretty excited to use that crane
2726880	2730320	i know maybe later if we have time let me just see if i can't
2730320	2733520	move on okay let's give it a shot we gotta act quick
2738640	2740560	yes did you do it yes
2745840	2750720	as you whip and you try to pull the e-brake and be really fucking cool you're in a truck
2750720	2755200	you've never driven before and you catch an edge on one of the tires because it's too
2755200	2761680	bald and old and you hit a rock or some shit and you flip this mother and as soon as the truck
2761680	2767840	flips everyone in the back just flies out and i need everyone to roll constitution in order to
2767840	2774160	avoid taking damage for this car crash including pass john lee pettymore so i have that i have a
2774160	2778800	thing that makes it so that i basically can't lose a con but i went ahead and rolled and i got a 69
2778800	2786640	so i technically could succeed i got a 33 no you oh my god i cannot wait to describe this
2788160	2790800	hell yeah man success
2793040	2800080	fuck yeah freeze frame the truck is perpendicular to the ground the driver's side only about six
2800080	2806640	inches from the crunchy december grass and the water and fish filled truck bed is erupting
2806640	2816240	sideways yeeting keith out at the speed of john's insane out of body recklessness heavy on the wreck
2816240	2822960	but with a success keith lands right on top of jimmy sanders who gets squished into the now
2822960	2830000	wet and fish covered ground john's critical allows him to grab a hold of tyler and tuck and roll
2830000	2837040	smoothly out of the driver's side window and as the truck rolls we see john and tyler huddled
2837040	2846000	together somehow unscathed by this chaos field machine but most importantly with a 69 clark
2846000	2853760	leaps out of the truck bed allowing it to roll underneath him as clark's legs begin churning at
2853760	2861120	the speed of the crash he lands mid sprint and continues to chase the tumbling truck as it rolls
2861120	2870080	wildly into the exit for contention's intersection directly toward there's a big sign what would the
2870080	2875760	sign be for there's a big sign that says owls tires and tigers i'm gonna suggest
2878160	2883280	and it's got a big arrow pointing to the right to the north and it says like one mile
2883360	2890960	on your left keith vigna john lee pettymore jimmy sanders are all just like on the ground
2890960	2899360	andrew carrey oh andrew carrey oh shit uh i'm gonna roll for drew carrey yeah roll for drew carrey
2903840	2908880	i can't read it 77 77 ooh what does that mean
2909120	2916160	okay we're good drew carrey takes a fair amount of damage but not enough
2916160	2924640	it's uh five hit points of damage as drew carrey oh let's see constitution check to stay conscious
2924640	2935680	passes fails shit so drew carrey unconscious on the ground laying in a just a wet puddle with uh
2936000	2942400	with fish just flapping around on the ground and keith vigna and jimmy sanders are also in this
2942400	2949680	wet mess john lee pettymore and tyler are huddled with each other on the ground having just rolled
2949680	2956800	out of this insanely dangerous situation and clark bishop is standing just watching this truck
2957520	2965360	just erupt into flames in this intersection as it destroys a sign for owls tires and tigers
2965920	2971200	i guess we don't really need to move the crane now i need an alertness check from everyone
2975040	2982640	fail eight pass i pass a 15 on a 70 zach just rubbed his head for good luck
2982640	2985360	yeah put the fucking hat back on american history x
2996320	3002720	oh zackie poo that hurt so you uh
3006800	3010080	you should have left more or taken more i don't know
3012320	3018320	you gotta go full lex luther or your dad both of whom are hot bald dudes just to the right of the
3018880	3024320	sign that is just exploded up into truck flames because that's what happens when
3024320	3029280	vehicles roll they all explode every time right not a chance that they wouldn't for sure to the
3029280	3037200	right of that you see that there is a storm drain that leads down into the sewers and there are arms
3037200	3043600	that are crawling out of the storm drain and you see a very brightly colored shirt and a man pokes
3043600	3054880	his head up out oh my god gary gary y'all need to come with me right now
3073600	3080880	oh
