00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
It's your Dimension Super Heavyweight Champion, Wolf the Dog.

00:04.600 --> 00:12.680
And I'm here to do some big punches live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:12.680 --> 00:19.800
Prepare your skulls to be pummeled by my beautiful voice and maybe my nasty fists.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.440
If you start acting up, that is.

00:22.440 --> 00:26.640
Now, I ain't pulling no punches here with this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

00:26.680 --> 00:30.240
It's from AtAlchemistBBQ on Twitter.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.320
They write,

00:31.320 --> 00:37.720
Hey PTBP crew, thank you for inspiring me to run my own Delta Green game.

00:37.720 --> 00:44.440
Whether dealing with aliens, time travel, yeetin' babies, or stealing microwaves,

00:44.440 --> 00:48.680
there's not been a dull moment while handling the bastard's crew.

00:48.680 --> 00:54.480
I look forward to the next arc post-contention for more inspiration.

00:54.520 --> 00:59.120
Just sure hope that all these games aren't secretly a summonin' ritual,

00:59.120 --> 01:04.880
allowin' the tendrils of the crawlin' chaos to manifest in our world.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.840
What are the odds of that?

01:07.720 --> 01:09.440
What the fuck is a yeet?

01:10.080 --> 01:13.800
Thanks for writin', AlchemicalBBQ pitmaster.

01:13.800 --> 01:20.200
I still don't know what you people all mean by these games that people are runnin'.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.280
I only report on what is happenin' in real life.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.360
The great IRL.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.720
Now, if you wanna write up something for your heavyweight champion Wolf to Hal,

01:31.720 --> 01:36.520
please send your messages as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

01:36.520 --> 01:40.920
And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP,

01:40.920 --> 01:47.760
the newest and only radio station wherever I happen to be next.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.400
And speaking of next, here's an announcement.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.520
Whoa, this here is the finale of Control Copy.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.960
So strap in for safety, my restrained pups, and hold on tight.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.520
We're gonna take a week off.

02:01.520 --> 02:06.280
If all goes as planned, we'll be back on Friday, January 28th,

02:06.280 --> 02:09.400
with the kickoff of a brand new short story.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.520
I'm sure you have questions.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.120
Will it be Delta Green?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.000
Yes.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.480
Will it be written and handled by Zack?

02:16.480 --> 02:17.600
Yes, again.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.280
Will it have an entirely new set of players?

02:21.280 --> 02:24.480
Whoa, yes, yes.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.000
Allie, Lindsey, and Taylor will be back,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.120
returning after their acclaimed run in the woods of contention.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.760
And they will be joined by a secret special guest.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.800
And if you can guess who it is,

02:37.800 --> 02:41.560
I'll say your internet name live on air.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.440
All right, that's enough news.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.360
It's time for the news.

02:45.360 --> 02:51.000
Just now, a corpse washed up on 34th Street Beach in Ocean City.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.440
The body is horribly disfigured and the eye sockets are empty.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.840
The skin has mostly sloughed off,

02:57.840 --> 03:01.440
but witnesses at the scene say the corpse has a long,

03:01.440 --> 03:05.320
knotted scar up the right side of its face.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.000
Hmm, who else have I heard of recently

03:08.000 --> 03:10.160
that had a scar like that?

03:10.160 --> 03:11.280
Oh, that's right.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.160
It was Arvin Chilton's landlord, Alexander Duchesne.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.600
But if this waterlogged carcass is Duchesne,

03:20.600 --> 03:24.600
then who or what is in Duchesne's apartment?

03:24.600 --> 03:28.480
Now, for the last and most on-the-nose time,

03:28.480 --> 03:33.280
give it up for Brian Bulger with Bad in a Good Way.

03:33.280 --> 03:40.080
Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end

03:40.080 --> 03:43.880
But the drowning's been just fine

03:43.880 --> 03:48.280
And when my ears pop and the shell shock

03:48.280 --> 03:52.280
Of this pit stop frees my mind

03:52.280 --> 03:56.280
I'll be all right, I can go there

03:56.280 --> 04:00.280
Now that I stare, death in the face

04:00.280 --> 04:04.280
I'll be all right, I can go there

04:04.280 --> 04:08.280
Now that I stare, death in the face

04:10.280 --> 04:11.880
What's up, everybody?

04:11.880 --> 04:13.080
Oh, that was pretty good.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.880
Do you want to give it a...

04:14.880 --> 04:16.080
What's up, everybody?

04:16.080 --> 04:18.280
Do you guys want to give it a quick go of like,

04:18.280 --> 04:19.880
it's Zach, I'm Zach?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.080
Do you want to?

04:21.080 --> 04:23.080
It's Zach, I'm Zach.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.680
Oh, it's Zach, oh, I'm Zach.

04:24.680 --> 04:25.480
Oh, no.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.880
That's what it sounds like to me every time.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.280
Oh, no.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.280
God, God.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
Well, how close was I?

04:33.280 --> 04:34.480
You were over.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.280
By how much?

04:35.280 --> 04:36.080
Like four seconds.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.280
Were you rushing?

04:37.280 --> 04:38.280
Were you rushing?

04:38.280 --> 04:39.080
Or were you dragging?

04:39.080 --> 04:40.680
I was dragging.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.880
Dragging these nuts across your face.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.080
God damn it.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.080
At the end of the last episode,

04:49.080 --> 04:51.480
you all made an alertness check.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.680
Two of you passed and the last thing you heard was rain.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
But what a wild up.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.080
I mean, so much happened.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.680
Oh, my gosh.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.680
Really the most we've ever...

05:01.680 --> 05:02.880
The most land covered?

05:02.880 --> 05:04.280
So much distance covered.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.880
So much plot covered.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.680
If you guys were on Find My iPhone

05:09.680 --> 05:11.880
and you were tracking each and every one of you,

05:11.880 --> 05:14.480
I'm not sure much would have changed

05:14.480 --> 05:15.880
during the last episode.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.480
Oh, no.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.480
Yeah, I couldn't pinpoint it.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.680
It's not going to pinpoint that closely.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.080
We went above.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.680
We went upstairs.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.080
Yeah, we could be in the exact same dot location,

05:26.080 --> 05:27.880
just one story above.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.880
Find My iPhone can't tell you that.

05:29.880 --> 05:30.480
Maybe it can.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.080
I've never used it in like a tall building.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.680
We don't have many of those around here.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.880
We really don't.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.280
We're from Springfield, Missouri

05:39.280 --> 05:40.680
if you're listening to this

05:40.680 --> 05:42.080
and you haven't heard us before.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.680
It doesn't matter, tall building or not.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.280
I've never used it on a second floor.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.680
Okay, so I recently used it on a second floor

05:47.680 --> 05:48.880
to find Taylor's phone.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.880
Did it say it's on the second floor?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.280
Nope.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.080
There you go.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.080
How many stories is the Hammond's Tower?

05:56.080 --> 05:56.880
16?

05:56.880 --> 05:57.880
Yeah, 69.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.480
1669.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.080
That's where I grew up.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.080
Go there.

06:03.080 --> 06:03.880
Doc Zach in the past.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.080
Go there right now.

06:05.080 --> 06:05.880
Past docs.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.880
Oh, I do have to actually delete that probably.

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
Because people will go there.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.080
It probably could be used for an interview.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.480
It could be used as like an old address number.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.680
Or they could go murder the people that bought that house.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.280
Right.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.880
All right, let's bail, bail, bail, bail.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.880
And it's raining.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.880
So we passed alertness rules,

06:22.880 --> 06:24.080
but all we heard was rain.

06:24.080 --> 06:24.680
I know.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.280
And I'm going to tell you, I met a game tier.

06:26.280 --> 06:26.680
Yeah.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.280
You said, was the highest 114?

06:28.280 --> 06:29.080
And I said, yeah.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.880
Which means it was an opposed roll.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.480
Oh, interesting.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.880
I wonder who we were opposing.

06:33.880 --> 06:34.880
We're doing a fair amount of meta gaming here

06:34.880 --> 06:36.880
at the end of this scenario.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.480
So we know this thing can create some kind of false reality

06:40.480 --> 06:42.480
or even shield.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.280
It prevents things around it from sensing it, right?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.080
Because it killed that gas station attendant.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.480
In full view of that witness who thought they heard something,

06:50.480 --> 06:52.480
like it looks like they almost hear something,

06:52.480 --> 06:56.480
but then they just turn around, like walk away.

06:56.880 --> 07:02.080
So yeah, good meta gaming Joe.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.280
I hadn't put that together.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.080
Roll sanity, Luke.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.880
Just for Luke.

07:07.880 --> 07:11.280
I fail.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.280
Luke's eyes just got so big.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.080
Yeah, he hit a breaking point.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.680
Put them back in your eye.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.280
I'm obsessed with vaping now.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.680
And being a little stinker.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.880
What a horrible mania to take.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.880
Well, he's a little stinker.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.880
All right, let's dive in and let's cover ground.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.480
We'll see.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.480
GPS wise.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.880
What about Nikomania?

07:36.880 --> 07:43.880
And I'm addicted to nicotine and the Velvet Underground.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.680
Boom.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.680
Great one.

07:47.680 --> 07:48.680
If it was called Nikotine.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.880
As you guys have been reading through the phone of Arvin

07:51.880 --> 07:59.180
Chilton, you have found this phone number that was called

07:59.180 --> 08:02.980
twice. Once the day after the McCarty murders and once the

08:02.980 --> 08:08.680
day of the Quentin Harris murder, but previous to that gas

08:08.680 --> 08:13.880
station attendant being murdered and you hear rain outside.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.080
Okay, I look out the window.

08:15.080 --> 08:15.780
Is it raining?

08:16.280 --> 08:16.680
Yes.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.780
Hey Sparrow, do you want to call this number?

08:20.780 --> 08:22.380
I don't think I should do the talking.

08:22.580 --> 08:22.880
Yeah.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.380
All right.

08:24.780 --> 08:25.180
Yeah.

08:27.380 --> 08:33.480
Just feels like we should be running downstairs, but at least

08:33.480 --> 08:37.780
check the bathroom that we did see the dirt trail didn't go

08:37.780 --> 08:37.980
to it.

08:37.980 --> 08:39.380
I have to pee Elwood.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.080
Oh Jesus.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.880
Do you ask me permission to pee?

08:45.880 --> 08:47.580
Joe, Joe, what happened for the story?

08:48.180 --> 08:49.280
Somebody needs to check the bathroom.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.480
I got a pee.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.480
Is it really bad?

08:51.980 --> 08:54.580
Number one, number one bad.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.680
Scale of one to ten.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.080
So you can't hold it.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.580
He's hopping around and it's like making the whole house.

09:02.580 --> 09:03.980
Oh, you look like you're about to pop.

09:03.980 --> 09:04.680
Get in there.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.080
Go.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
I go to the bathroom.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.280
There's nothing abnormal in the bathroom.

09:12.580 --> 09:13.180
Ought one.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.580
I get it right in the toilet.

09:14.580 --> 09:20.180
You wasted an ought one on pissing.

09:20.180 --> 09:23.280
Yeah, incredible piss.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.180
He feels he feels like a spring in his step.

09:26.180 --> 09:30.380
Maybe like he's got an extra awareness or something about

09:30.380 --> 09:35.180
it. Plus twenty to any role that you would like during this

09:35.180 --> 09:39.380
episode because of how well I just pissed incredible.

09:39.380 --> 09:42.280
I wash my hands, but you have to tell me before you roll that

09:42.280 --> 09:43.380
you want to use your plus twenty.

09:43.380 --> 09:48.380
I wash my hands and slowly walk out of the bathroom.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.280
So yeah, did you want to call this number or are we just

09:50.280 --> 09:51.280
going to leave it be?

09:51.380 --> 09:54.080
Yeah, she was about to but then she heard like what was

09:54.080 --> 09:57.480
obviously the clearest like most perfect piss hitting the

09:57.480 --> 09:58.480
center of a toilet.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.880
It dazed you.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.180
Yeah, this is an Andre giant.

10:02.180 --> 10:05.380
So it's like it's kind of like a getting a fire hose like

10:05.380 --> 10:05.880
stream in there.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.580
Maybe I would assume I picked up my dice tray and I showed

10:09.580 --> 10:10.280
it to Joe.

10:11.180 --> 10:13.180
I saw that you want me to share what it was or you want to

10:13.180 --> 10:14.980
keep it. So I didn't share what I rolled.

10:14.980 --> 10:18.580
It was a 69 or we don't know.

10:18.580 --> 10:22.280
Well, so every time so yeah, I think I kind of know.

10:24.980 --> 10:29.580
Yeah, so agent Sparrow calls that number bring bring bring

10:29.580 --> 10:36.780
bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring bring

10:36.780 --> 10:41.980
bring bring bring it rings until you think it's the last

10:41.980 --> 10:45.080
possible second before it's going to go to voicemail.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.080
She hangs up.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.280
Totally kidding Arvin you goddamn son of a bitch.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.480
What the fuck did you do?

10:58.980 --> 11:00.680
What did you do?

11:01.080 --> 11:01.480
Hello.

11:02.780 --> 11:03.780
This is not Arvin.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.380
My name is Clarissa Sparrow.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.280
What did Arvin do to you?

11:08.380 --> 11:09.280
Who are you?

11:09.680 --> 11:10.780
Who are you?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.080
Someone who's trying to help.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.480
How do you have this phone?

11:14.080 --> 11:14.980
Arvin dropped it.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
We don't know where he is.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.080
We're worried for him.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.480
Worried for him?

11:18.680 --> 11:22.480
Be worried for the death wake that he left behind you.

11:23.180 --> 11:25.580
Be worried for my fucking brother.

11:25.580 --> 11:25.980
Okay.

11:25.980 --> 11:26.180
Yeah.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.180
So that's kind of I didn't know if you were really on his

11:28.180 --> 11:29.080
side or not.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.880
Seems like not right.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.380
Yeah, so you're not neither are we we're not worried for him.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.580
We're trying to stop him.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.980
He killed my brother.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.380
He killed Quentin.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.380
That was the gas station attendant.

11:41.580 --> 11:43.380
Yeah, interesting.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.680
He called you two days before your brother died.

11:46.780 --> 11:47.680
How do you know Arvin?

11:49.380 --> 11:52.680
My brother knew Arvin back in 01.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.180
You know him from the Steel Hill home.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.180
The Steel Hill home.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.180
Yeah, it was this fucked up fucking cult that my brother

12:01.180 --> 12:02.180
got stuck in.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.480
They trapped him there.

12:05.780 --> 12:08.480
It tricked him told him the world was different than what

12:08.480 --> 12:10.180
it is and he fucked with them.

12:10.180 --> 12:14.080
It changed him different how he wasn't able to focus on

12:14.080 --> 12:14.580
anything.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.180
He was not able to be inside.

12:16.180 --> 12:16.980
He was different.

12:16.980 --> 12:17.780
Sorry, not your brother.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.480
How did they say the world was different?

12:19.980 --> 12:24.080
No, I don't listen to the endless nonsense that came out

12:24.080 --> 12:27.680
of his me and Arvin close after that.

12:27.780 --> 12:31.080
I didn't even know that Arvin was a part of it until he

12:31.080 --> 12:31.980
called me.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.980
What did you talk about when he called you?

12:34.580 --> 12:36.480
I didn't even know him.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.880
I didn't even know his name.

12:38.180 --> 12:41.080
He's just sound like an old friend who would lost touch

12:41.380 --> 12:49.480
and I just mean to told him where Quentin was.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.280
Yeah, cuz he lied to you.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.180
Yeah, he told you he was somebody else.

12:59.180 --> 13:06.280
What did he say to you the next time he called what did

13:06.280 --> 13:14.680
he say I'm gonna kill she did he say anything like oh,

13:14.680 --> 13:15.480
I'm gonna kill him.

13:15.880 --> 13:22.480
Oh, that's a fail on the sanity check from hearing even

13:22.480 --> 13:26.980
a mimicry of the sound that you heard from Arvin Chilton

13:27.280 --> 13:31.480
that horrible day the worst day of this man's life.

13:31.580 --> 13:40.080
And he weeps and weeps and you hear him set down the phone

13:40.180 --> 13:43.880
and then you hear him kind of walk away and he's just crying.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.980
Okay, so I hang up I dial again.

13:46.980 --> 13:59.680
Sir, hello.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.880
You're gonna fucking laugh at me when you meet for me for

14:08.880 --> 14:11.680
gay. No, I swear to God.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.480
I'm not laughing.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.280
I'm trying very hard not to laugh at your me me me's.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.180
He lost his sanity check, so he's not going to be much use

14:19.180 --> 14:20.480
anymore. Okay.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.680
What was the name of that cult Steel Hill home?

14:26.680 --> 14:29.580
All right, let's go check on Mr.

14:29.580 --> 14:30.080
Duchesne.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.880
My God is actually just keep rolling for these cops to be

14:37.880 --> 14:38.680
brutalized.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.980
I think he did the cops kick his ass.

14:42.980 --> 14:43.880
Whoo doggy.

14:44.780 --> 14:46.180
Yeah, the scenario is wrapped up now.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.880
They took care of it outside for us.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.380
Well, they were they really wanted to bully somebody some

14:51.380 --> 14:52.980
more like they got it.

14:52.980 --> 14:55.180
They really got it into them with Kevin and they're like

14:55.380 --> 14:56.980
this old man is going to be easy to pick on.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.380
Let's just beat the shit out of him.

14:59.780 --> 15:03.580
I also like the picturing like cop cars and bodies flying

15:03.580 --> 15:04.980
by the windows outside.

15:06.580 --> 15:07.780
We're like it's raining.

15:07.880 --> 15:11.480
It's raining tentacle laps against the window.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.180
It's really coming down.

15:16.180 --> 15:16.480
Yeah.

15:16.480 --> 15:16.880
Wow.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.280
We're going downstairs.

15:20.280 --> 15:20.580
Aren't we?

15:20.680 --> 15:21.080
Yep.

15:21.480 --> 15:25.080
All right marching order, please Kevin go down first.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.480
All righty for the first time Clarissa is kind of behind

15:31.480 --> 15:35.780
Kevin to like she's seen Elwood do so many times we can share

15:35.780 --> 15:37.880
him. I'll be at the very back.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.280
Yeah now like you're actively crouching behind her to now

15:41.280 --> 15:45.580
and like your hand is occasionally on her shoulder like

15:45.580 --> 15:49.080
pushing her into a more like wow, this guy's Weasley.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.680
I go down the stairs are the cops still outside as you're

15:53.680 --> 15:54.980
going down the stairs.

15:54.980 --> 15:57.980
You see no police officers outside.

15:57.980 --> 16:02.680
Whereas before you would have seen six police officers outside

16:02.680 --> 16:05.980
and how many were inside there were two inside other cars

16:05.980 --> 16:07.880
gone their cars are not gone.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.080
No, I didn't expect it would be those mean.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.780
Cops are going to be inside.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.580
I open the door.

16:18.580 --> 16:21.180
Go ahead and roll sanity all of us.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.980
Yeah 97 I fail.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.280
I crit succeed.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.480
Oh, wow.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.480
The only one who's going to lose zero sanity here probably

16:32.080 --> 16:33.580
85 on a now 80.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.380
Failing failing crit succeed.

16:38.380 --> 16:43.780
So at the Chris exceed Elwood Boyd, he's fucking free.

16:44.380 --> 16:49.780
There's like something in him that just represses all of

16:49.780 --> 16:54.180
this sanity loss down to absolutely nothing.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.180
Whereas the the other the other two of you.

17:00.980 --> 17:01.780
How much?

17:01.880 --> 17:05.680
Who's tensing today?

17:05.680 --> 17:08.580
Hi, that's my breaking point for sure.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.080
Elwood what's wrong with you?

17:14.580 --> 17:18.880
I mean seemingly a lot because the Duchesne home is an

17:18.880 --> 17:23.880
abattoir a slaughterhouse and the smell of spilled blood

17:23.880 --> 17:28.680
and flesh both rotting and fresh penetrates your nostrils

17:28.880 --> 17:34.680
like an unwelcome houseguest as you all notice there's been

17:34.680 --> 17:38.980
a distinct vibe switch in this withering old man's apartment.

17:39.280 --> 17:44.580
It's as if a merciful veil has been cruelly lifted and the

17:44.580 --> 17:49.580
reality of your situation begins to sink in as you stare

17:49.580 --> 17:56.080
into the face of Arvin Chilton the target of your mission

17:56.180 --> 18:00.780
and you know deep down in the sickening turmoil that's brewing

18:00.780 --> 18:06.680
in your guts that you never spoke to Alexander Duchesne

18:06.680 --> 18:11.080
at all. Arvin Chilton looks like his photograph but a version

18:11.080 --> 18:15.480
that has been completely lost to madness his hair darts

18:15.480 --> 18:20.080
in every direction akimbo like his eyes any visible skin

18:20.180 --> 18:24.880
is covered in scratches and dried blood and the often mended

18:24.880 --> 18:29.180
clothes that wrapped around the short stout landlord now

18:29.180 --> 18:34.980
hang awkwardly from his tenants tall gaunt frame the whole

18:34.980 --> 18:38.880
confusing and unnatural switcheroo situation is topped by

18:38.880 --> 18:42.980
the same old pork pie cat dawned by what had appeared to

18:42.980 --> 18:47.480
be Alexander Duchesne, but Arvin Chilton isn't the only

18:47.480 --> 18:49.880
horribly unfamiliar thing in this room.

18:50.080 --> 18:56.680
The walls are now or always were painted in human blood

18:56.880 --> 19:02.380
dirty hands spread and shaped the gore like gruesome finger

19:02.380 --> 19:07.880
paint into the symbol of the testament of new flesh displayed

19:07.880 --> 19:13.180
man seen on the side of the Ocean City Cafe human body parts

19:13.180 --> 19:17.480
are strewn throughout this place a loose tongue here a sole

19:17.480 --> 19:21.980
foot there a length of dripping intestines is draped over

19:21.980 --> 19:27.380
a stained lampshade and in some cases you recognize instances

19:27.380 --> 19:31.380
where your eyes must have lied before the ashtray on the

19:31.380 --> 19:37.380
coffee table is now a Glock 17 wet with vital fluids the

19:37.380 --> 19:42.180
two mops are now Mossberg shotguns where there were once

19:42.180 --> 19:47.480
five baseballs placed randomly around there are now four

19:47.780 --> 19:54.680
M67 grenades and the food that's still sitting out my fucking

19:54.680 --> 19:55.480
God dude.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.580
He stole that straight from David Winters.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.480
What is it?

19:58.580 --> 19:59.380
What is it?

19:59.380 --> 20:00.980
How did you eat the next time?

20:00.980 --> 20:04.380
We had an opportunity at the very next time.

20:04.780 --> 20:05.980
How did you fall for that?

20:06.780 --> 20:11.280
Guess what the olives are eyeballs eyeballs and guess what

20:11.280 --> 20:18.780
the thin cuts of meat were penises flesh human flesh and

20:18.780 --> 20:23.580
slices and there's a mound of chewed up human flesh.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.280
Oh my God.

20:25.680 --> 20:32.580
So I need another sanity check point from both Elwood Boyd

20:32.580 --> 20:38.280
fail again and Kevin gelato for having eaten eyes and flesh

20:38.280 --> 20:39.080
that one's a fail.

20:39.080 --> 20:45.080
You're gonna lose three more sanity each of you and you are

20:45.080 --> 20:51.480
overcome with uncontrollable vomiting for a number of turns

20:51.780 --> 20:54.580
equal to the loss three turns.

20:54.780 --> 21:00.480
So for three full turns the only action you can take is yacking.

21:00.580 --> 21:04.980
Oh and one more change in the scene dressing the copy of as

21:04.980 --> 21:08.980
you like it that's sitting on the table as I lay dying.

21:09.080 --> 21:17.980
It was just a book.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.280
It's a title changed.

21:19.280 --> 21:26.480
That was all seems to be a diary of some sort some sort of

21:26.480 --> 21:31.480
leather-bound diary is the leather made out of humans.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.080
I feel like that seems obvious.

21:34.180 --> 21:36.780
So no, it's just a diary.

21:36.780 --> 21:38.580
The horse meat diary.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.880
Yeah, not not horse leather.

21:40.880 --> 21:48.680
No horse meat diary rotting flesh and finally at the feet

21:48.680 --> 21:54.580
of Arvin Chilton in a pool of their own blood are seven bodies

21:55.080 --> 22:00.280
each with their throat slit all uniformed police officers

22:00.280 --> 22:06.680
because I fuck you not he out rolled all eight.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.680
Police officers.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.680
So I don't doubt that but and then he rolled a 69.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.080
Yeah, but what so he's in front of seven bodies and the

22:16.080 --> 22:16.980
eighth one.

22:17.580 --> 22:22.580
He has this cop by the back of the neck and this cop is staring

22:22.580 --> 22:29.380
at the three of you with eyes that make you think maybe he's

22:29.380 --> 22:33.580
not looking at you even though his eyes are pointed in that

22:33.580 --> 22:40.680
direction and as Arvin, let's go of this body you see he's

22:40.680 --> 22:46.080
been holding this long knife that has a weird Bend on the

22:46.080 --> 22:50.780
end of it this crooked knife and this cop just slides off

22:50.780 --> 22:54.880
the end of it and face plants into the ground in front of

22:54.880 --> 22:56.880
you speaking of eyes.

22:56.880 --> 22:57.680
How are the bodies looking?

22:57.680 --> 23:01.680
Are they are they eyeful or eyeless so far only two of them

23:01.680 --> 23:04.980
are our eyeless cool that weird knife.

23:04.980 --> 23:07.480
He's got that look like an eye shucking knife.

23:08.980 --> 23:12.380
So let's work in dexterity order.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.780
I believe Elwood Boyd is up first Elwood.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.280
Where do you throw up?

23:20.980 --> 23:22.480
Just inside just inside the door.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.980
I think that's we've lost the sanity because we've peaked

23:24.980 --> 23:29.080
in so I'm at least that far inside Kevin gelato normally

23:29.680 --> 23:32.780
when someone loses over five sanity in one go we would have

23:32.780 --> 23:34.580
you roll fight flight or faint.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.480
However due to what is written in the scenario it says that

23:38.480 --> 23:41.980
for the next three rounds you are vomiting and so therefore

23:41.980 --> 23:44.580
I'm going to use that as your fight flight or faint response

23:44.580 --> 23:46.080
if that's cool with you, that's fine.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.380
Where are you violently throwing it?

23:48.380 --> 23:51.780
I had just stepped right inside the door since I was the

23:51.780 --> 23:55.580
first you were the first one in and I step right inside see

23:55.580 --> 23:59.780
it all and within seconds just like Jersey burger is coming

23:59.780 --> 24:05.580
out of Kevin and the munchy platter whatever that was called

24:09.080 --> 24:12.980
projectile vomits everywhere and as that's happening the

24:12.980 --> 24:18.880
camera zooms like into his head and Kevin is standing in

24:18.880 --> 24:22.380
the middle of a giant Stadium hot bright lights shining

24:22.380 --> 24:26.480
down on him the crowd is roaring Kevin is staring across

24:26.480 --> 24:30.380
the field giving a menacing look to Tom Brady Tom has a

24:30.380 --> 24:33.780
nervous look on his face and sweat is pouring off his forehead

24:35.580 --> 24:39.080
hike Kevin rushes through the defensive line and smashes

24:39.080 --> 24:41.980
into Brady Brady's head comes clean off his body is the

24:41.980 --> 24:48.680
crowd chance man yet man yet Kevin reaches down and grabs

24:48.680 --> 24:51.980
Tom Brady's head and holds it up in the air proudly displaying

24:51.980 --> 24:56.880
his bloody trophy money begins falling out of the sky

24:56.880 --> 25:01.480
as the camera zooms out 40 million dollars for two years.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.780
That's crazy, bro.

25:03.380 --> 25:06.180
Yeah, I know but I would can't come with me and it makes

25:06.180 --> 25:08.580
him it makes us sad.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.980
So I don't think I'm going to do it Kev.

25:10.980 --> 25:11.980
Are you serious?

25:12.080 --> 25:13.180
That's insane.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.580
Elwood walks in.

25:17.380 --> 25:20.180
We were just talking about Kevin's future football career

25:20.180 --> 25:23.280
Elwood sound thinking about that bullshit minion.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.080
You're better off here with me.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.180
We can do big things together together together and then

25:28.180 --> 25:32.380
the camera zooms out to Kevin puking in this living room.

25:32.480 --> 25:36.480
Hey Luke, you get 10 luck points for the rest of the scenario.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.480
Hell, yeah, basically these are going to be one-to-one for

25:40.480 --> 25:43.080
changing any role that you want to make for the rest of your

25:43.080 --> 25:45.080
time and I get on you already had plus 20.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.180
Oh and you have a plus 20 to a roll.

25:47.180 --> 25:47.880
Badass.

25:50.980 --> 25:56.280
Agent Sparrow's eyes meet the eyes of Arvin Chilton and they

25:56.280 --> 26:01.680
are absolutely crazed standing above eight slumped uniformed

26:01.780 --> 26:04.380
ocean shitty PD officers.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.280
Hey, man, only people from Ocean Shitty can say that.

26:09.280 --> 26:14.380
As the person playing everyone in Ocean City right now.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.280
I'm allowed to say it.

26:18.980 --> 26:24.180
He's holding a grenade in his hand and the pin has been pulled

26:24.480 --> 26:27.880
and his thumb is covering the clip.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.880
Roll a five fighter vane.

26:29.980 --> 26:35.180
One, two, three, fight, four, five, freeze, and six, flight.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.380
What'd you roll, Thomas?

26:36.580 --> 26:37.380
I rolled a one.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.380
Oh hell yeah, dude.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.980
Get that fight going, baby.

26:40.980 --> 26:43.980
Agent Sparrow, her eyes are darting around at this whole

26:44.080 --> 26:48.180
situation is she's trying to balance her FBI agent mind, her

26:48.180 --> 26:51.680
Delta Green agent mind, her student body president agent

26:51.680 --> 26:56.880
mind. It all builds to just, I've got to destroy this.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.480
Yeah, and she picks up one of the grenades.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.180
Yeah, pulls the pin on her own.

27:02.180 --> 27:07.380
Oh, yeah, and just tosses it like right towards him and the

27:07.380 --> 27:08.480
bucket of dynamite.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.080
Oh my God, what?

27:11.480 --> 27:11.880
Wow.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.080
Oh my God, okay.

27:13.580 --> 27:16.580
Joe doesn't know, sticks of dynamite and a grenade all mixed

27:16.580 --> 27:18.480
together would take out a block, wouldn't it?

27:18.480 --> 27:25.980
So in Delta Green, there is a 15% lethality rating for M67

27:25.980 --> 27:28.180
grenades within 10 meters.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.080
What about dynamite?

27:29.080 --> 27:34.480
Which is easily within this and then within dynamite is going

27:34.480 --> 27:38.880
to have a 10% lethality rating within 20 meters.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.180
And how many sticks are there?

27:40.180 --> 27:44.680
There were 19 sticks of dynamite in this bucket.

27:44.680 --> 27:49.080
It is absolutely going to compound and Agent Sparrow has chosen

27:49.080 --> 27:52.180
to end this threat.

27:52.180 --> 27:55.180
Which is the fucking Delta Green thing to do!

27:55.180 --> 27:57.380
I told you I fucking knew how to play Delta Green.

28:01.880 --> 28:08.480
Please roll athletics to throw this grenade in an accurate

28:08.480 --> 28:10.080
way. How big is this room?

28:10.080 --> 28:10.980
Dude, it's tiny.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.980
You really don't even have to pass this check for everyone

28:13.980 --> 28:14.580
to die.

28:19.580 --> 28:20.680
15 on a 30.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.980
It lands right in the bucket of dynamite.

28:22.980 --> 28:24.780
It lands right in the fucking bucket.

28:24.780 --> 28:29.080
You really based on the lethality of 19 sticks of dynamite

28:29.280 --> 28:32.680
as well as these two grenades and the other grenades in this

28:32.680 --> 28:34.280
room, which is three more.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.580
We're all going to die.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.780
Yes, before that happens.

28:38.280 --> 28:44.280
She takes one last look around at Kevin and Elwood and she's

28:44.280 --> 28:48.280
like, man, if we'd gotten three or four more episodes with

28:48.280 --> 28:50.180
these characters, I might have really cracked something in

28:50.180 --> 28:55.180
that dynamic and help Kevin realize his own potential.

28:55.580 --> 28:58.880
That thought manifests as just like a small glint in her

28:58.880 --> 29:04.480
eye before the entire room is a ball of light and flame.

29:04.580 --> 29:08.280
Elwood as he's puking puts his hand on Kevin's back.

29:08.380 --> 29:12.380
Kevin is still throwing up, but he sees the grenade get

29:12.380 --> 29:13.080
launched in there.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.280
He grabs Elwood and just lays like on top of him to try to

29:17.580 --> 29:20.480
prevent Elwood from getting exploded.

29:22.980 --> 29:29.480
Maybe the only thing and Andre the Giant from the blast.

29:29.480 --> 29:34.280
Okay, let's take a top over.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.380
Early Grand Theft Auto.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.780
Look at this scene.

29:41.180 --> 29:46.780
This two-story duplex fucking explodes.

29:47.980 --> 29:54.980
All four cop cars immediately just boom over on their sides.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.480
All the cars on the street are

29:56.480 --> 30:07.380
step away from the car.

30:09.980 --> 30:12.780
I mean, yeah, every window for a couple blocks.

30:13.180 --> 30:15.280
Every dog is barking.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.580
Twitter is blowing up.

30:16.580 --> 30:17.880
Did you guys hear that noise?

30:19.880 --> 30:21.480
And yeah, everyone is just a sonic boom.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.880
So here's what we're going to do.

30:23.080 --> 30:28.080
I'm going to have Luke roll the last roll of the scenario.

30:28.180 --> 30:29.780
Don't roll yet, please.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.380
You've got a plus 20 on this roll plus 20 plus 10.

30:34.380 --> 30:37.280
I'm going to add and you've got a plus 10 due to the luck.

30:38.180 --> 30:44.280
And what role do you think would satisfy the requirement

30:44.580 --> 30:50.980
of covering the body of Elwood Boyd enough to shelter him

30:51.480 --> 30:54.880
from this absolute blast?

30:56.080 --> 30:59.180
Just pure will and strength.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.580
Strength or athletics a thing, right?

31:01.580 --> 31:01.980
Let's see.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.380
Like are your constitutes your sheer size?

31:04.380 --> 31:05.480
Yeah, like your con.

31:05.680 --> 31:06.480
I could do con.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
All right, let's roll con.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.080
91 on a 95.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.280
Oh, so wait, we gave you a roll.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.280
You could not fail.

31:20.980 --> 31:28.580
I rescind my scream for something more dramatic.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.280
Is there anything you have at a 70?

31:31.380 --> 31:32.680
Well, everything else is at 80.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.780
So it would have been just automatic.

31:35.780 --> 31:38.280
So that at least gave a little leeway and I saw the nine

31:38.280 --> 31:47.780
I was like fuck 91 sirens smoke is fading from the scene

31:48.480 --> 31:51.180
red and blue lights cover everything.

31:52.280 --> 32:02.280
Red-eyed night shift EMTs begin uncovering 107 East 12th

32:02.280 --> 32:07.480
Street Ocean City, New Jersey as they're picking through

32:07.480 --> 32:13.780
the rubble they see movement a heaving spine.

32:17.880 --> 32:25.580
As Kevin breathes his last breaths his lungs are like popping

32:25.580 --> 32:32.580
out of his back and Elwood Boyd pushes his giant bodyguards

32:32.580 --> 32:35.780
body off the top of him.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.780
We got a live one.

32:37.780 --> 32:40.080
Somebody get the ambulance over here everybody.

32:40.080 --> 32:40.980
We need a stretcher.

32:40.980 --> 32:42.480
We need a stretcher now.

32:42.480 --> 32:48.380
Kevin's goggled eyes are staring right into Elwood's eyes.

32:49.580 --> 32:54.180
What is going through Elwood Boyd's mind as he looks through

32:54.680 --> 33:00.980
the goggles on the corpse of Kevin gelato?

33:03.580 --> 33:04.780
Oh, oh Kevin.

33:07.180 --> 33:09.880
Well, I'm going to need a new one.

33:12.480 --> 33:16.280
Oh, Jesus.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.580
Death in the face.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.880
I'll be all right.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.480
I can go there now.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.580
Loves their death in the face.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.880
Doesn't it always seem like the parts and made us laugh

34:14.880 --> 34:16.580
now make us cry.

34:17.380 --> 34:22.780
Doesn't it always seem like the villain Paul in the strings

34:22.780 --> 34:24.780
is a regular guy.

34:25.780 --> 34:31.180
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

34:33.780 --> 34:39.380
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.780
I'll be all right.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.480
I can go there now.

34:49.980 --> 34:51.980
I'll be all right.

34:51.980 --> 34:54.580
I can go there now.

35:13.780 --> 35:36.480
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

35:37.480 --> 35:44.480
White washed hymns and the deadly sins push me to my limit.

35:46.480 --> 35:52.480
When you deconstruct, you shit out of luck for a minute.

35:54.480 --> 36:00.480
After the last bend, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

36:06.480 --> 36:24.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

36:27.480 --> 36:33.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

36:36.480 --> 36:42.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

36:42.480 --> 36:49.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

37:06.480 --> 37:16.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.480
He's trying to eat another grinder.

37:46.480 --> 37:55.480
Without a key, please.

37:55.480 --> 38:05.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

38:10.480 --> 38:16.480
Clasp your fist over all the blood.

38:16.480 --> 38:20.480
Water leaks through your fingers.

38:20.480 --> 38:26.480
You're standing in a swirling flood.

38:26.480 --> 38:31.480
And only darkness leaves.

38:51.480 --> 38:57.480
Falling fast into a deep abyss.

38:57.480 --> 39:02.480
Till it sets you out again.

39:02.480 --> 39:08.480
Find your feet on your broken bones.

39:08.480 --> 39:18.480
You're out for the edge again.

39:38.480 --> 39:49.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

40:08.480 --> 40:18.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.

40:38.480 --> 40:49.480
You and me have gone bad in a good way I promise.
