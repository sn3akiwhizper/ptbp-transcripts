WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What's everybody do?

00:03.680 --> 00:09.000
Keep going. Oh boy. My name is Zach and this is pretending to be people

00:09.000 --> 00:14.900
We are a role-playing podcast and we are playing the game Delta green, but it's not really Delta green

00:14.900 --> 00:21.260
It's an amalgamation that we have come up with that is a mixture of the role-playing systems Delta green and pulp

00:21.560 --> 00:24.600
Cthulhu with all that nerdy shit out of the way for the rest of you listening

00:24.720 --> 00:30.920
This is a collaborative storytelling experience that you will be listening to over the coming weeks

00:30.920 --> 00:34.760
I am here with Joe. Hey, I'm Joe Luke. I'm Luke and Thomas

00:34.760 --> 00:40.240
I'm Thomas having heard many stories from other DMS GM's out there. I

00:40.720 --> 00:42.520
consider myself to be

00:42.520 --> 00:48.680
Extremely lucky with the group that I have been blessed with as a player same same same

00:48.680 --> 00:53.160
We have been playing together for three years now. This is our third campaign

00:53.160 --> 01:00.920
We ran two ten-month-long Delta green campaigns where we played weekly and we've kept the exact same group ever since I

01:01.000 --> 01:05.760
Am fully in love with this game Thomas. What's your experience with role-playing?

01:05.760 --> 01:08.680
I started with D&D like a lot of people and

01:09.240 --> 01:12.880
Wanted something a little more story based and less mechanics driven

01:12.880 --> 01:18.120
I didn't like sitting around for 30 minutes while the wizard took his turn. So Delta green was perfect for that

01:18.120 --> 01:26.200
It's all about character interaction and like solving this mystery together and combats are very like combat is very simple quick and rare and rare

01:26.200 --> 01:30.120
Yeah, and violently, you know, you're shooting guns at each other. It ends it gets over with quickly

01:30.120 --> 01:34.760
Like you said we've been playing together for the past few years. That's been the highlight of my week that whole time

01:34.760 --> 01:42.400
I'm Luke my role-playing experience in high school. I played Dungeons Dragons twice the group that I played with

01:42.720 --> 01:47.080
Didn't take it very seriously and our DM took it very seriously

01:47.120 --> 01:49.480
So we were not invited back to play

01:50.120 --> 01:57.760
and then after that the next time I played was Delta green with Zach and Thomas and a couple other people and yeah, I

01:58.160 --> 02:02.080
Loved it. I've pretty much constantly been playing it since I

02:02.560 --> 02:07.920
Started playing with this group Thomas actually texted me kind of out of the blue one day about wanting to do

02:08.440 --> 02:13.200
D&D game with some mutual friends of ours and I I think unbeknownst to him

02:13.200 --> 02:18.640
I had already been kind of wanting that I had been listening to podcasts and watching shows on Twitch and things like that

02:18.640 --> 02:19.480
So we did it

02:19.480 --> 02:23.880
It was it was awesome to have that all of a sudden pop up that group didn't last for very long

02:23.880 --> 02:29.480
But pretty quickly after that dissolved Thomas again asked if I wanted to join you guys and I said fuck

02:29.480 --> 02:34.520
Yeah, and you guys seem to like me so I stuck around we were big fans. You brought an element of

02:35.080 --> 02:37.080
seriousness to our table

02:38.600 --> 02:43.040
Much needed that had not existed there before I remember the

02:43.200 --> 02:47.760
Very first time that you role-played with us you were playing Taylor my wife's partner

02:47.760 --> 02:52.160
Yeah, you gave me a couple options for characters and I picked the FBI agent. Yeah, I'd seen X-Files

02:53.520 --> 02:58.180
And then we had one of our best sessions to date right then and there it was amazing

02:58.180 --> 03:03.960
I don't he brought the energy for sure. I'd never met Joe before I played with him now. I see him every week

03:03.960 --> 03:04.640
Hey, baby

03:04.640 --> 03:10.640
I hope that you guys become our best friends the way that I have become best friends with my role-playing group

03:10.680 --> 03:17.440
As we wiggle our way into your ear holes each week, please also invite us into your hearts and to your parties

03:17.440 --> 03:21.920
Yeah, invite us to your parties by a spear. We really like drinking drinking

03:22.760 --> 03:27.600
Marijuana. Yep, if you're offering are you offering are you offering? Hey internet listener?

03:28.600 --> 03:35.920
Are you holding PO box? I think it's worth mentioning that Zach created all of this stuff. We don't know anything that's happening

03:35.920 --> 03:38.620
We try to not talk about it too much outside of the game

03:38.840 --> 03:41.620
We really want to be surprised by each other and by Zach

03:41.620 --> 03:48.560
Yeah, and actually one of my favorite things about this group is as we've come to play together for longer periods of time

03:48.560 --> 03:53.880
We've kind of talked and you guys have given me full reign to fuck over your characters

03:53.880 --> 04:00.000
Which is a very fun thing to give your DM the right to do and I try to take full advantage of that

04:00.000 --> 04:05.640
There are a couple parts per episode where I will have written the description of a character or the description of a place

04:05.640 --> 04:11.600
But outside of that everything is improv. It is also a closed game. Oh, that's a really good point Luke

04:11.600 --> 04:13.160
So we play a closed game

04:13.160 --> 04:18.600
so anytime one of these characters goes off on their own the player also sits in the room with

04:18.720 --> 04:24.120
Just me and we go through what happens that way the players can keep secrets from each other

04:24.120 --> 04:29.280
It's like secrets and lies the name of the game that continues outside the podcast, too

04:29.280 --> 04:32.080
We try not to talk to each other about what's going on in the game too much

04:36.560 --> 04:37.800
It's

04:37.800 --> 04:44.520
Kind of scary. It's kind of violent. Oh, yeah, this is a horror mystery. Yeah, this is a horror mystery graphic content warning

04:44.520 --> 04:49.100
You may see there is an explicit tag on all of our episodes

04:49.100 --> 04:52.260
This isn't just because we use the fuck word

04:52.260 --> 04:58.120
It's also because a lot of the descriptions within the story are going to be gruesome and brutal with

04:58.280 --> 05:03.760
Hopefully a lot of comedy and come for the heart stay for the gore come on the heart stick it to the door

05:04.200 --> 05:08.760
Come on the door come on the heart to in the stink it gets a lot worse than just shooting people

05:08.760 --> 05:16.040
Yeah, it can be pretty icky icky, but don't worry. We bring enough warmth and humanity and humor and humor hopefully humor

05:16.040 --> 05:17.080
We hope you think it's funny

05:17.080 --> 05:23.460
So we got together and we created a small town together that this story would take place in

05:23.840 --> 05:29.440
Contention contention is the name of this fictional town in this fictional universe that is based

05:29.800 --> 05:36.180
Loosely on our own world people could easily relate this to x-files or

05:36.920 --> 05:41.600
Season 1 of true detective pretty much anything that has a creepy supernatural

05:42.040 --> 05:46.080
Ambiance to it, but we're also going to try like to keep it funny

05:47.800 --> 05:55.920
Like that case in point with awesome Twilight jokes just fucking constantly we're on the bleeding edge of cultural relevance

05:56.920 --> 05:58.920
We recorded this in

05:59.100 --> 06:01.100
2011

06:01.200 --> 06:03.680
Basically what we've done is we've set up a

06:04.320 --> 06:10.720
Story in which these three guys are playing police officers of this small town of contention

06:10.720 --> 06:12.080
We did this for a couple reasons

06:12.080 --> 06:18.760
It's an easy way to get them involved in a mystery within their small town and have the power and the free time

06:18.960 --> 06:25.200
To look into said mystery very excited to have our friend Justin involved in this podcast

06:25.520 --> 06:31.840
He will be the first voice that you hear as Justin is playing wolf the dog the a.m

06:31.840 --> 06:36.200
radio DJ in the town of contention who will be our narrator and

06:36.680 --> 06:44.240
Introduce each episode. He is also responsible for creating the original music that you will hear backing this

06:44.520 --> 06:51.080
Podcast Justin did all of our music except for the intro except for the intro which was done by kudzu a band from our

06:51.080 --> 06:56.880
Hometown of Springfield, Missouri kudzu. You look them up on bandcamp. Thank you kudzu. Thank you kudzu

06:56.920 --> 06:59.740
We also record it in the nude. You should know that

07:00.560 --> 07:06.880
Hot room hot room sweaty. That's why we take our covered in molasses for sustenance

07:08.240 --> 07:15.260
But we have a very very specific rule. You're not allowed to eat your own molasses. No only only your friends molasses

07:15.260 --> 07:22.460
Yeah, we eat molasses. So thanks everyone for downloading and listening to our first episode of pretending to be people

07:22.460 --> 07:24.500
We hope that you continue to listen now

07:24.580 --> 07:31.660
Let's get that a.m. Dial in position to six nine four point two and hand it over to wolf the dog

07:31.860 --> 07:39.860
What's up, my babies? It's wolf the dog coming at you from six nine four point two PT BP contentions newest and

07:40.780 --> 07:41.620
Only

07:41.620 --> 07:47.780
Radio station some of you surrounding listeners might not know contention like we all do here

07:47.780 --> 07:51.420
But it's a small quiet town about an hour west of the city

07:51.600 --> 07:57.380
Now the date on this here calendar says it's December 1st. And let me tell you it's a warm one out there

07:57.860 --> 08:02.180
Dogs are barking going crazy and I've been seeing a lot of homeless folks lately

08:02.180 --> 08:06.260
But you know be kind to those throw a little change the way for your buddy wolf the dog

08:06.300 --> 08:12.660

He's a 17 year vet

09:25.540 --> 09:30.180
It hasn't risen up the ranks kind of cuz there's not a whole lot of rank upping to go

09:30.180 --> 09:34.260
But he's a little bit sad about the fact that he's still where he is in life

09:34.300 --> 09:38.980
But he also takes a lot of pride in his job and he's okay at it Luke what character you playing

09:38.980 --> 09:44.500
I'm playing Keith Vigna. I am a 29 year old police officer. I

09:45.180 --> 09:50.960
grew up in contention and then I had a big aspirations moved to the city where I

09:51.220 --> 09:56.740
Became a police officer was not that great at it and they kind of transferred me back to the town

09:57.100 --> 10:01.300
Just to get rid of me bad cop. I'm not a bad cop. I'm just a

10:02.180 --> 10:04.180
bad cop

10:05.260 --> 10:11.660
So, yeah, I'm bad I'm bad at copping but I'm a I'm not a bad guy you're also kind of freshy too

11:23.060 --> 11:25.500

Is he wearing two belts?

11:28.900 --> 11:31.580
two belts three pairs of suspenders and

11:32.700 --> 11:34.700
They're super glued to my body

11:35.500 --> 11:39.520
Thomas what character are you playing and what kind of pants does he wear?

11:40.900 --> 11:47.420
I'm playing John Lee Pettymore. He is from contention. He's a local boy. He wears pants that are a little too tight. Okay

11:47.620 --> 11:52.860
Probably how tight is a little too tight just enough noticeable. Mm-hmm bummer. Yeah

11:53.580 --> 11:58.660
Not for the ladies of contention. Hey, oh some of his extended relatives are kind of nerdy Wells

11:58.900 --> 12:03.180
He might not always see the rules as unbendable

12:03.180 --> 12:07.300
He knows how they do things in contention more importantly in the haulers outside of contention

12:07.820 --> 12:13.700
What do you guys what are you guys wanting to do with this thing? Have fun. You want to have some fun?

12:13.700 --> 12:17.980
I want to have some fun has a phone. I don't want to get a little spooked. I want to get a little spooky

12:17.980 --> 12:24.020
Yeah, I think hopefully it's gonna get spooky. I'm only interested in total iTunes chart domination. I

12:24.820 --> 12:28.460
Want to be so spooked that my huge britches are plenty wet

12:30.300 --> 12:35.820
Some big ol wet britches, I want to fill my coaches you got so much extra fabric

12:36.820 --> 12:38.820
I can have a big ol load

12:39.740 --> 12:45.260
Take a big old dump in my pants if I need to and nobody will know nobody I think of don't know

12:45.260 --> 12:49.060
Oh, well, everybody will know but nobody will tell me pass an alertness check

12:52.900 --> 12:57.620
These britches are ready to go. I'm ready to just jump on ready to jump on in. All right

12:57.620 --> 13:03.700
Well, our story does begin on an unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called contention

13:03.980 --> 13:08.160
Thin mist can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road

13:08.820 --> 13:11.200
the inside of the contention police department

13:11.200 --> 13:18.160
However is cozy warm and bright a smiling man sits behind a large secretary desk littered with papers and snack wrappers

13:18.200 --> 13:24.860
He has a round baby face and small teeth and he is wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie

13:25.140 --> 13:31.680
This man's phone rings this guy by the way, he's the secretary in the office. He's like the office or his gums big or

13:32.340 --> 13:38.240
Small that was an interesting detail. He's got small teeth, but he's got gums that stick out

13:38.280 --> 13:44.020
I kind of picture him as like like small teeth, but very very healthy gums. Oh, those are some real

13:44.840 --> 13:52.520
You can absolutely see a half to three-quarters of an inch of gum in between teeth on top lip

13:52.520 --> 13:58.860
Yes, it's almost as if his top lip is receding. It's to come into the gum. It's a common occurrence exactly

13:58.860 --> 14:02.140
Yeah, he's wearing a sweater vest over a shirt and tie and his phone rings

14:02.680 --> 14:07.400
Which happens often in the office? We cannot be vaping on mic all the time

14:07.400 --> 14:12.840
We're gonna sound like assholes. Yes. I was trying to get out of the range, but you weren't gonna work

14:12.840 --> 14:14.840
Yeah, sorry. Tell me if this works. I

14:16.960 --> 14:20.280
Can't tell how much of that it was ambient now, I don't think it was in the headphones

14:20.280 --> 14:23.560
This will be an edited podcast but not so tightly edited

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
the juice

14:26.760 --> 14:32.120
Refrain from just going overboard quick technical question. Yeah, do you have each of our mics on a different channel?

14:32.120 --> 14:34.120
I do have all your mics

14:34.520 --> 14:36.520
Absolutely

14:36.720 --> 14:40.320
Every time I vape I'm just gonna do this and then I turn my mic off

14:41.440 --> 14:46.800
He's in the middle of a sudden not only can I but I will do that

14:47.440 --> 14:51.660
Also Luke your your food is at the door. Oh, hell yeah go do that

15:00.440 --> 15:03.360
Check this out. He was like, yeah, what are you guys doing today?

15:03.400 --> 15:07.200
I'm like, oh, yeah, we're just playing some Dungeons & Dragons and he goes, oh, that's cool

15:07.200 --> 15:09.200
Have you ever heard of Delta Green?

15:10.720 --> 15:16.220
Shit you not I'm like, that's actually what we're playing and he's like no way it I'm like, yeah

15:17.520 --> 15:21.220

16:18.460 --> 16:20.460
Okay, so

16:20.460 --> 16:22.460
So

16:28.140 --> 16:32.540
His phone rings and he picks it up before the first ring is finished drew Andrews

16:32.540 --> 16:36.820
Oh, I mean a contingent PD. What is what is your emergency? Oh

16:37.940 --> 16:43.540
My god. Oh, that is insane. Yeah. Yes, of course and he looks at all of you

16:44.060 --> 16:51.300
This is definitely an emergency this time the dogs over in the old neighborhood have been howling for over an hour straight

16:51.300 --> 16:56.920
Do we need to send out multiple of you or just do you think everything's gonna just send ray? Oh, okay

16:56.920 --> 17:03.380
Okay, I'll get him on the phone. The day is closing up and it's probably around 5 p.m

17:03.980 --> 17:07.780
and drew Andrews this man with the gums and the

17:08.020 --> 17:11.460
Small teeth comes out from the back room and he's got a little cupcake

17:11.780 --> 17:18.420
and it's got one candle in it and the candles lit and he goes over and knocks on the door of the chief of police of

17:18.940 --> 17:20.940
contention chief

17:21.160 --> 17:28.820
Chief we got his fries for you. She comes on out. It's a small little birthday celebration for the chief Maggie cook

17:28.900 --> 17:32.300
She's a strong fit woman with a dark bob and intense eyes

17:33.100 --> 17:37.380
Always in uniform this woman you've never seen her not wearing her uniform

17:37.380 --> 17:43.040
He pulls out this little gift that's wrapped and she opens it and it is a new journal

17:43.040 --> 17:49.300
And you guys would know that she always has a blue journal with her like a notebook everywhere

17:49.300 --> 17:53.740
She goes and it's the specific brand that she likes. And so this one is yellow

17:53.740 --> 17:58.980
Oh, so now you have one of each color, isn't that it's neat. Thank you so much drew

17:58.980 --> 18:01.020
I really appreciate you doing that for me

18:01.020 --> 18:06.820
This is really this is really sweet kind of looks around the office at you guys Clark goes ahead and gets in his desk

18:07.300 --> 18:13.580
Kind of rummages for a second. He pulls out a little box of chocolates with a bow on it. Happy birthday, Maggie

18:13.580 --> 18:19.700
I should have seen this coming Clark. Yep. I know you like them. So I thought I'd do it do it again this year

18:19.700 --> 18:26.380
They're my favorite and she she opens the box immediately and pops one in her mouth. Mmm. Happy birthday to me

18:26.820 --> 18:31.620
Can I can I have one? Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course Clark. I grab one without asking I

18:33.060 --> 18:38.500
Go into my desk and I pull out like two-thirds of a bottle of cheap bourbon. Hey, here you go Maggie

18:39.500 --> 18:43.960
Happy birthday chief. She looks at it and she's kind of like oh, yeah

18:45.180 --> 18:48.400
This will go. No, it's not your brand. This will go nicely

18:49.200 --> 18:53.840
With the the three-quarters of a bottle that I have sitting on my bar cart from last year

18:54.680 --> 18:58.120
Yeah, well, you know, happy birthday, thank you very much John

18:58.120 --> 19:02.500
I appreciate that and then you all kind of look over at Keith who and I'm I'm

19:03.080 --> 19:06.200
Sweating because I had no idea that it was her birthday

19:06.320 --> 19:11.640
This is my I've been here for like like a couple months maybe when you are sweating

19:11.640 --> 19:18.640
She looks and there is a box that's sitting in the room. That's this white box with a black bow on it Oh Keith

19:19.360 --> 19:25.920
You wrap this present beautifully I thank you so much I had no idea that you would have even known it was my birthday

19:25.920 --> 19:30.520
Yeah, I I don't pride myself on giving the best gifts, but I do pride myself on

19:31.040 --> 19:38.560
Wrapping wrapping the best. She grabs it and she starts opening the bow and she opens the top of it. Oh, oh

19:39.880 --> 19:44.820
Oh my god, and she immediately walks back into her office and closes the door behind her

19:45.620 --> 19:51.980
What what did you get her Keith I didn't that was not mine I didn't even know it was her birthday you fucked up who

19:52.860 --> 19:55.380
Was that one of your guys's boxes or drew was that yours?

19:55.380 --> 19:58.300
I go look go over to the bat box and see if there's a tag or anything

19:58.300 --> 20:04.300
So she took the box in with her into the drew the office drew. Did you do you know where that box came from?

20:04.900 --> 20:10.620
No, I didn't see anything come in. That's really strange. It just it was just here

20:10.620 --> 20:14.940
I guess and it was probably right it might have been right and right about at that moment

20:14.940 --> 20:21.060
The chief comes walking out of her office and she is completely broken down

20:21.300 --> 20:28.100
Tears have clearly been streaming down her face. Her face is red. You've never seen her in this emotional state before Keith

20:28.100 --> 20:30.860
What the hell did you get her was not mine. She

20:31.580 --> 20:35.740
Immediately walks from her door out of the office

20:37.260 --> 20:39.060
Chief

20:39.060 --> 20:43.940
Doesn't even pay attention takes off and it's gone. Did she have the box in her hands? No, I

20:44.780 --> 20:50.740
Feel really bad. I'm gonna go into her office and see what was in that box. Yeah, you messed up this gift, buddy

20:51.060 --> 20:55.020
So when you walk into her office, it's neat. It's like a super

20:55.860 --> 20:57.540
office

20:57.540 --> 21:01.460
What a cool place. This is great. She keeps saying I want to be

21:02.340 --> 21:08.820
Very organized and you look inside this white box and there's no like wrapping or anything

21:08.820 --> 21:13.660
Inside of it. There's no paper or anything. I need a tag or anything on it. There's no tag on it

21:13.660 --> 21:18.540
There's just three items inside the box. It is a flower. It's a rose. It's a single rose

21:18.540 --> 21:25.000
There's a hard hat just like a straight-up normal white hard hat and a black silk bowtie. I want to plop that

21:25.540 --> 21:30.220
Hard hat on my head see if it fits it fits cool. I'm gonna put it back on the box

21:32.340 --> 21:34.340
Role-playing

21:34.660 --> 21:39.780
I'm gonna I'll go back out into the main room and tell them what I saw I come back out

21:39.780 --> 21:41.180
I I had the box in my hand

21:41.180 --> 21:46.180
I'm like does any of this mean anything to you and I asked the DM does any of that mean anything to me?

21:46.180 --> 21:52.700
I don't I don't think any of these things would particularly stick out to you as having any

21:53.660 --> 21:57.460
Intrinsical meaning that's a weird collection of things there

21:57.500 --> 22:03.300
The phone rings as you guys are talking and drew picks up in his same like nervous hurried voice again

22:03.340 --> 22:09.620
He's just like drew a contention PD working at me and he's talking in the background as you guys are talking

22:09.620 --> 22:12.060
I wonder what's up with those dogs. I go into the

22:12.660 --> 22:18.220
Her office and look in the box and I pick up the tie and I want to see if there's any like is it monogrammed

22:18.220 --> 22:22.880
In any way, is there anything on the tag any any sign of any no ownership? Nope

22:22.880 --> 22:28.620
Okay, just a very plain black silk bowtie. It's untied drew is on the phone

22:28.620 --> 22:31.000
He hangs up and he looks at you guys and he's like

22:33.300 --> 22:35.500
Um fellas

22:37.820 --> 22:40.780
Somebody found a body out at the junkyard

22:42.540 --> 22:44.540
I

22:44.820 --> 22:47.660
Think this is an actual emergency you guys I

22:50.420 --> 22:52.540
Don't I don't know they hung up immediately

22:52.620 --> 22:59.020
she it was a woman's voice and she said that there was a body at the junkyard and that we needed to come out and

22:59.020 --> 23:02.660
And look at it immediately and she was she's kind of slurring her words

23:03.300 --> 23:07.340
Did you get her name? She just said Julie and then stopped immediately

23:08.420 --> 23:11.180
Talking after that and just hung up

23:11.180 --> 23:17.700
I don't know what happened, but there was like a I heard something kind of not break

23:17.700 --> 23:24.780
But I heard something kind of there was a noise and then she like screamed a little bit after she said her name

23:24.780 --> 23:29.700
And and then and then she hung up immediately and you said this out at the junkyard. Yeah

23:30.060 --> 23:32.300
Go check it out. Okay, so you guys all have

23:33.100 --> 23:38.500
Individual police cars that you can take. Yeah, I can ride together. I think we should all take our own cars

23:38.500 --> 23:39.500
Just in case I'm with you

23:39.500 --> 23:45.580
I take a pull of my bourbon off the Chiefs desk before I go out. Yeah any complaints from the other two officers?

23:45.580 --> 23:47.580
I don't think they see that

23:47.860 --> 23:51.680
You do it sneaky. I don't know petty more well enough to reprimand him

23:51.860 --> 23:55.340
So I just kind of turn a blind eye to that and okay

23:55.340 --> 24:01.340
So the three you'd go ahead and grab that pull off the bottle before you head out and the three of you are going out

24:01.340 --> 24:03.940
It's a dark night. I'd say it's pretty nice

24:03.940 --> 24:07.860
It actually feels more like fall than it does winter at this point in December 1st

24:07.860 --> 24:12.700
But there's like a light mist coming down. So I would say it's real dark out

24:12.700 --> 24:17.220
You got the streetlights guiding your way the junkyard sits on the far

24:17.820 --> 24:22.220
Southeast corner of town and it's where the old mine was

24:22.380 --> 24:24.560
This is an old mining town back in the

24:25.060 --> 24:31.520
1800s and the junkyard is out on top of where the the old mine was throwing junk down the shaft

24:33.300 --> 24:35.900
That's I mean honestly just filling it up

24:35.900 --> 24:36.420
Oh, yeah

24:36.420 --> 24:36.820
Yeah

24:36.820 --> 24:42.980
and so you guys are gonna drive from downtown out on a few country roads to get out there and

24:43.100 --> 24:45.100
So supposed to be anyone

24:46.100 --> 24:48.100
Throwing the junk down the shaft

24:49.100 --> 24:53.120
That's actually their the motto of the junkyard. It says that on the sign

24:54.980 --> 24:59.820
Shaft shaft rowers piston junkyard shaft throwers. We can do better

25:01.380 --> 25:03.380
Let's return to that

25:03.920 --> 25:07.340
So you guys are driving out there it's night as you're going out there

25:07.340 --> 25:12.700
There is a car coming from the other direction that is flying going

25:13.220 --> 25:18.660
Maybe double the speed limit. It's probably 45 out here and this car is going 80 90 miles an hour

25:18.660 --> 25:22.300
What is our order Clark's Clark's very first? Okay

25:22.300 --> 25:28.300
Well, I'll be second because you were busy taking a pull your bourbon before you hopped in the car. So it takes so long

25:28.540 --> 25:31.100
Yeah, drink. Yeah. Yeah, you've savors it

25:33.180 --> 25:35.180
Swash it around

25:36.300 --> 25:38.580
Jim this was a $13

25:38.580 --> 25:40.580
Dollar

25:41.660 --> 25:45.560
B-mate is that the good stuff for John Lee anymore? Appreciate every sit tin high

25:48.420 --> 25:51.580
What's out there but $13 $13, okay

25:51.580 --> 25:56.100
So the three of you are driving down this road in this car flies by you as anyone pulling off

25:56.100 --> 26:00.140
Are you gonna get on the radio and say who's gonna take care of that? Yeah, I'll get that. Okay

26:00.140 --> 26:02.140
I want to see a dead body

26:04.060 --> 26:06.860
Go get him kid, so Keith Vigna and

26:07.300 --> 26:08.540
Clark Bishop

26:08.540 --> 26:11.020
Continue on to the junkyard and John Lee Pettymore

26:11.380 --> 26:17.740
Turns his car around and I immediately if the lights weren't on I assume that they are on now and you're in chase mode

26:18.140 --> 26:22.320
So go ahead and roll me a drive check

26:22.700 --> 26:27.940
Thomas to see if John Lee Pettymore can catch up and successfully pull over this car

26:28.220 --> 26:33.440
All right, John Lee Pettymore. What's your drive in his younger? He's got a pretty good drive 70

26:33.440 --> 26:39.240
Oh nice, he used to drive World of Outlaw sprint cars. Hell yes plays a lot of Forza Oh

26:41.400 --> 26:48.560
20 nice nice. So you just flip it around and immediately are on the tail of this car. It looks pretty cool

26:48.560 --> 26:54.760
It does the car is slightly swerving and also still going probably 80 miles an hour

26:54.760 --> 27:00.000
But she is about to hit more into the town and less of a country road

27:00.000 --> 27:04.040
You're gonna go ahead and want to pull her over as soon as possible. I do that nice

27:04.160 --> 27:08.520
So go ahead and roll luck for me. Yeah, what did I put those dice with?

27:08.520 --> 27:13.640
Let's keep those dice at least those percent. We're playing percentage dies. Oh

27:14.400 --> 27:20.040
Not only okay 55 on a 50. So this is a great way to describe how this game works

27:20.040 --> 27:26.800
So he had a 70% and drive drive being the skill and he rolled a 20 which is a success

27:26.800 --> 27:32.120
So you want to roll underneath your score if he rolled a 22 with the tens dice matching

27:32.120 --> 27:34.160
That would be a critical success

27:34.160 --> 27:40.540
And then if you roll above your skill, which just happened which just happened

27:40.540 --> 27:47.280
It's a failure because your luck is 50, right? Yep, and he rolled a 55 which the dice match and it's above

27:47.280 --> 27:53.000
Which means it is a real fail the car in front of you loses control and immediately

27:53.440 --> 27:55.760
Crashes into a telephone pole

27:56.280 --> 28:01.840
Smashes at 80 miles an hour into it. Oh fuck and you with that drive

28:03.780 --> 28:10.520
Can pull over however you want to so are you going alongside in front of behind like how are you pulling up on this?

28:10.520 --> 28:13.440
Her car just smashed into a telephone smashed into a telephone pole

28:13.440 --> 28:20.500
I pull off right in front of it and I run and make sure she's all right, but the driver is all right

28:21.500 --> 28:25.580
Whoo-hoo-hoo as you get there you see that the windshield is

28:25.980 --> 28:31.320
Completely smashed open and there's no one sitting in the driver's seat. Fuck. All right. Okay, I get out my flashlight

28:31.320 --> 28:34.020
Oh, I don't have to I don't have to have an accent when I'm describing my

28:35.620 --> 28:40.340
Pull out my flashlight I get out my flashlight. Yeah, I immediately start searching the area

28:40.340 --> 28:44.740
I'm looking for you know, it's it's very clear. She is like was she thrown

28:44.740 --> 28:48.820
She was thrown clear of the vehicle and she is alive

28:48.820 --> 28:53.180
You can actually hear her like screaming and moaning about 20 yards away

28:54.180 --> 28:56.180
Woof. Yeah. Yikes

29:01.180 --> 29:04.420
I'm glad I had some bourbon. It honestly sounds like an animal dying

29:04.420 --> 29:10.900
I call the county hospital immediately to get an ambulance out here. You can already hear the ambulance. I rush to

29:12.540 --> 29:16.880
These guys are good. They're very good at their job. I rush over to her and see what I can do

29:16.880 --> 29:20.300
Okay, roll medical check of some sort gonna have to be

29:21.720 --> 29:25.720
I've got no medicine skills and I have 10% first aid. Yeah

29:27.120 --> 29:30.100
That's a fail on the first day. Oh, yeah, she looks great

29:30.880 --> 29:35.860
No, I don't see anything wrong here. Why are you crying?

29:42.020 --> 29:44.180
Ma'am stop resisting

29:44.180 --> 29:46.180
Her

29:46.500 --> 29:48.500
Face is split wide open

29:48.780 --> 29:55.940
And she's bleeding profusely and you have absolutely no idea how to stop bleeding of the face sure as hell

29:55.940 --> 29:59.140
Don't cutting to the two of you who went out to the junkyard

29:59.220 --> 30:05.900
You guys pull up and the headlights are shining through an old rusty chain link fence and through the end of the fence

30:05.900 --> 30:09.240
You see at the end of the lights reach of your headlights

30:09.260 --> 30:16.880
The ground is splattered with blood and a lifeless body is crumpled on the moist dirt about 20 yards past the fence

30:16.880 --> 30:18.780
inside this junkyard is

30:18.780 --> 30:23.320
The gate locked to the gate is locked. Is there barbed wire? There is barbed wire

30:23.320 --> 30:29.360
Oh, I was gonna climb over but I got better since than that plus my big bridges if I get caught on the bar

30:30.440 --> 30:32.440
Bet you guys have some cutters

30:32.640 --> 30:38.540
Yeah, well, hey, shut up Thomas. You're not there. Can we can we get a hold of who owns this place?

30:38.940 --> 30:46.180
The Pistons this is the piston junkyard and the NBA team. Yep, the Detroit pistons. Hey Clark

30:46.980 --> 30:53.100
Junkyard and content. What's big boss pistons name? So you would know it's two brothers who run the piston family

30:53.500 --> 30:56.980
Leo and George and they are the piston brothers

30:56.980 --> 31:00.940
I think that Clark Bishop would know these two from back in the day Clark

31:00.940 --> 31:06.240
You got Leo or George's phone number, uh, you can probably get a hold of Leo sure do

31:06.240 --> 31:09.080
Okay, give him a call come have him unlock this

31:09.080 --> 31:12.840
I don't have to cut through if we don't need to but let him know it's a serious situation

31:12.840 --> 31:19.680
Yeah, I'll give him a call the phone rings like six times before there's a click and then you just hear this

31:29.120 --> 31:34.920
Leo hey Leo. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's it's Clark Clark. Hey

31:35.760 --> 31:39.040
We've got a situation up here at your yard Clark who?

31:39.900 --> 31:43.340
Bishop with the contingent PD, you know me Leo

31:44.400 --> 31:46.800
We've got kind of a thing going on up here at your yard

31:46.800 --> 31:51.680
We need to we need you to come down here and let us in in the pig farm. No your junkyard. Oh

31:52.720 --> 31:54.720
Okay. Well, uh

31:55.320 --> 31:57.320
I'm busy

31:57.480 --> 32:04.000
I'm bit Leah, you know, I wouldn't call you if it wasn't important. There's there's something there's uh, there's something real bad might happen

32:05.600 --> 32:10.680
Okay, I'll get my keys and I'll be down in a second. All right. Thanks, man. Okay

32:11.320 --> 32:13.280
So a old truck pulls up

32:13.280 --> 32:19.200
It's like a beat-to-death old truck probably from like the 50s and it seems like it was taken care of for a long time

32:19.200 --> 32:21.200
But hasn't been taken care of recently

32:21.560 --> 32:24.040
Rust is starting to grow on it

32:25.300 --> 32:31.780
He pulls up and a large man in overalls covered in pig shit gets out

32:32.780 --> 32:34.780
You know kind of

32:35.700 --> 32:40.900
waddling I guess is the right word towards you guys and he's got this big circle ring of

32:41.340 --> 32:46.340
Keys that he's already like in the darkness trying to thumb through trying to find the right one

32:46.900 --> 32:51.860
Clark I was busy, but you know, you're you I like to keep you guys

32:51.860 --> 32:56.860
I'll be down here any time that you need. I'm just like to be a good citizen

32:57.580 --> 33:02.400
We know Leo we know we we're not making fun of this guy's mental health are we no

33:03.580 --> 33:05.580
Definitely. This is what he sounds like

33:06.180 --> 33:09.940
This is a character voice that I have chosen for this man

33:09.940 --> 33:14.980
and just because he's not that smart and has a thick accent doesn't mean that he's not a

33:15.420 --> 33:17.420
fully fleshed out

33:17.740 --> 33:22.420
Character and a human being we love and we love and respect

33:23.020 --> 33:25.020
Hey Leo, do you?

33:25.980 --> 33:27.980
Leo when's the last time you were?

33:37.820 --> 33:45.220
Cut it at Thomas's mic when he's not in the room and Leo when's the last time you were here I had to come by to

33:45.220 --> 33:47.220
sweep up

33:48.300 --> 33:52.940
Two weeks ago, you haven't been here for two weeks. It's George was George here today

33:53.020 --> 33:57.900
Nobody comes out of here ain't nobody jumps anything anymore. Is it just you and your brother who have keys to this here?

33:57.900 --> 34:03.060
Yeah, Kathy, who's Kathy? No, it's a George's wife. You know, do you know? Okay. Oh Kathy, of course, of course

34:03.060 --> 34:05.060
We know okay. I call her Katie

34:05.940 --> 34:10.580
All right. Well if you can go ahead and open up this gate, I I don't know if you can't

34:11.700 --> 34:17.260
I don't know if you've noticed this but if you take a peek over there, I think you can see why it's such a serious situation

34:17.940 --> 34:19.220
Oh

34:19.220 --> 34:21.220
Is that it? Yeah

34:21.860 --> 34:28.200
Well, I didn't this wasn't me like I didn't I don't know you are the prime suspect right now

34:36.300 --> 34:40.300
He's so scared like looking in his eyes he is the scariest boy I

34:41.060 --> 34:44.340
Slap him on the shoulder. I said, I'm just kidding. You haven't been here in two weeks

34:44.340 --> 34:49.260
He drops his keys and he's like picks him back up. He's trying to fumble with him and he's like, okay

34:49.260 --> 34:54.300
It's this one and he goes over and he unlocks the gate. Can I go home now? Yeah, okay

34:54.820 --> 34:59.100
Did he leave the could you leave that key here for us and we can get back to you tomorrow?

34:59.100 --> 34:59.580
Yeah

34:59.580 --> 35:06.220
He's very he's very quick with his fingers and he gets the key off the ring immediately and hands it to you and it's like

35:06.340 --> 35:12.020
Okay, I'm gonna go home now. Yeah, I think we would have I'm not here, but I don't think we would have any further questions

35:12.020 --> 35:16.640
No, yeah, I just have reason to detain this. Yeah. Well, I'm being sarcastic

35:17.440 --> 35:21.480
Yeah, okay, yeah, hey Leo, we'll we'll get that key back to you tomorrow

35:21.480 --> 35:26.460
But we probably will have a few questions once we return that to so just you know, nothing bad

35:26.460 --> 35:28.640
Just be prepared to have a little conversation tomorrow

35:29.540 --> 35:35.240
Okay, I will prepare to have a conversation with you tomorrow. Also don't mention this to George cuz

35:36.480 --> 35:40.540
You know, I want you guys getting any funny ideas. Just kidding

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Nervously and leaves

35:44.320 --> 35:47.360
Okay, let's open this and go take a peek at this body

35:53.240 --> 35:55.320
So you guys get your poking sticks

35:56.720 --> 36:03.480
So the the gate opens two of you walk in and you're looking around this junkyard. It is a massive junkyard

36:03.480 --> 36:05.800
We're talking 10 acres of land

36:05.800 --> 36:12.680
I mean this thing is massive and there's junk piled up every which direction right in front

36:12.680 --> 36:18.840
Can I roll to see if I find anything cool? Uh, yeah roll so live in a dead body. What's your search 40?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Okay, that's a 95

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
95 you see a day is gone

36:23.480 --> 36:25.600
so seriously in front of you, there is a

36:26.360 --> 36:32.520
crumpled up dead body with blood splattered all around it in every direction and it is sitting right in front of

36:32.680 --> 36:36.520
They're basically the only building on this entire land

36:37.040 --> 36:39.880
Mass that is kind of serves as like an office

36:39.880 --> 36:42.800
It's a quickly put up almost like trailer

36:42.880 --> 36:48.440
It's got one door one window kind of place and it's got the sign on it piston junkyard all that jazz

36:48.440 --> 36:52.400
It's sitting the body is like right in front of it. Uh, I look over at Clark

36:52.400 --> 36:54.500
I say I don't think we're gonna need an ambulance for this one

36:54.500 --> 36:59.480
But uh, do you have that the camera equipment lights and stuff in your car? Is that in I do? Okay, you got it

36:59.480 --> 37:04.040
What's that? Let's go ahead and get that set up. We gotta take some pictures of this but you go run into that

37:04.040 --> 37:06.320
I'm gonna take a peek at it. Yeah, okay

37:06.320 --> 37:10.320
So I want to go up and inspect see if I can see if I can see why

37:10.840 --> 37:12.840
This is a dead body. Okay, so

37:17.440 --> 37:20.320
We know one thing I'm gonna interrogate the body

37:21.280 --> 37:23.240
roll human

37:23.240 --> 37:24.720
with your vast

37:24.720 --> 37:32.680
Intelligence that Keith vignette my 50 intelligence you can tell this this body seemed to hit there's blood

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
splattered in a circular

37:35.520 --> 37:38.820
Range around this body in every direction

37:38.980 --> 37:43.400
So it looks like this body was thrown here or dropped here

37:43.400 --> 37:48.480
Is there any footprints or anything around or does it look like it just became here it?

37:50.520 --> 37:55.680
Looking around though. The ground is wet a little bit. It's like the ground is the ground is moist and

37:57.120 --> 38:01.000
There there are no footprints in the area except for your own

38:01.000 --> 38:07.360
So it is it is since it's like damp or whatever it would I would be able to notice footprints if they yeah

38:07.360 --> 38:13.400
I think so. Okay, I return with the lights on the camera and I go ahead and set up some good floodlights on the area

38:13.400 --> 38:17.600
Yeah, and start just taking. Yeah, let's take some pictures before we move this body for

38:18.440 --> 38:22.400
Posterity isn't in front of the front door of their office. It's just in front

38:22.400 --> 38:27.480
It's like probably 10 yards away from the building and it's not centered on anything in particular

38:27.480 --> 38:31.960
It's just like there do I looking at the building? Do they have any security cameras set up? No

38:32.880 --> 38:38.360
Snap some pics and then I'm gonna is this face down or face up face down. I'm gonna roll him over

38:38.360 --> 38:44.920
That's him. Is it a can I tell or I'm gonna roll the body when you roll the body over cannot see its face

38:44.920 --> 38:48.520
But it does seem to be the body of a woman. Why can I not see its face?

38:48.520 --> 38:52.940
Well, okay, you can see her face, but the face is smashed completely

38:53.500 --> 38:55.500
Beyond recognition beyond all

38:56.020 --> 39:01.380
Recognition this is not a great night for faces. Oh, you know a lot of faces getting messed up in contention

39:01.380 --> 39:05.780
Can I can I see if there does she have teeth or finger fingers?

39:05.780 --> 39:11.700
It looks like she did probably have teeth at one point but not anymore. Nah, all right

39:12.220 --> 39:18.140
Would it would we be able to identify like fingerprints? It's like a black bloody mess and yes, there are fingers

39:18.220 --> 39:23.380
Okay, I go and get out my little 10 in case your 10 fingers in case you were wondering nice

39:23.420 --> 39:25.580
Look at these fingers, dude. These are great

39:26.220 --> 39:28.860
We can well, I don't know how many she started out with

39:28.860 --> 39:33.900
I hope she has committed a crime at some point. That way we can identify her in our database

39:33.900 --> 39:39.140
I do the I just take a my ink pad and grab a few. Yeah fingerprint fingerprints got him

39:39.140 --> 39:44.200
I'm right so other other than her face, which is smashed. Is there any other visible injuries?

39:44.800 --> 39:50.120
Smashing mostly it looks like she took smashing damage from the from all over or just the face

39:50.120 --> 39:55.540
I would say it looks like from where she hit the ground is where like all of

39:58.840 --> 40:03.520
Hit the ground I look at is there anything directly above us when you look up

40:03.520 --> 40:08.760
The sky is above you and that seems to be it. Wow, that's amazing. The sky is up there

40:08.760 --> 40:11.460
I want to go through the pockets when you go through the pockets

40:11.460 --> 40:18.580
There is a small piece of paper that is folded a handful of times and this piece of paper is a thick piece of white

40:18.580 --> 40:24.060
Parchment on it is written in this weird black thick ink and it says

40:24.860 --> 40:28.300
We is striking when the land gets darkness

40:28.940 --> 40:31.340
readying torches hesitate not

40:33.700 --> 40:41.380
You're looking at this body and it is wearing what seems to be really thick hand stitched clothing and leather boots and

40:41.580 --> 40:46.420
Besides that note in the pocket. That seems to be all you can really garner from it

40:46.420 --> 40:51.700
Is there style to the note? Is it written like a poem and does it have funky punctuation?

40:51.700 --> 40:58.540
It has punctuation it is we is striking when the land gets darkness period readying torches period hesitate not period

40:58.540 --> 41:02.420
Okay, but no it's not in stanza form. Yeah, it's not formatted in a weird way

41:02.420 --> 41:04.980
It's just written as it could fit on this piece of paper

41:05.140 --> 41:09.960
So that was folded up a couple times and put stuffed into her pocket

41:10.240 --> 41:14.680
So you're taking pictures that was the only thing in the pocket. That is the only thing in the pockets

41:14.680 --> 41:21.680
How big are the britches fitting nice? I I hike my big old britches up. I'm like man. Those are some nice pants

41:21.680 --> 41:27.680
I want to take a strand or two of hair and put it in an evidence bag. Absolutely cutting back to

41:28.280 --> 41:35.960
John Lee Pettymore is at the scene and the ambulances arrived. They are going to ask you what happened

41:35.960 --> 41:43.200
Well, I was in pursuit of this intoxicated young woman and she fucking smashed her car in that goddamn telephone and ripped her face open

41:43.240 --> 41:49.840
I've not seen that's anything like that in a while. Obviously, you know sprint car race and you see your fair share of smashed faces

41:49.920 --> 41:53.800
Okay, so they're done like as soon as they get that information. They're like, okay

41:53.800 --> 41:56.400
Well, we need to get her to the hospital. And so they start

41:58.760 --> 42:01.260
Yeah, the thing about racecar driving

42:01.260 --> 42:09.620
So they get out nerves a steal they get her on to a gurney of sorts and it's not a gurney barrel and

42:13.540 --> 42:20.940
Bamboo wood and cheesecloth and they get her in the back of this ambulance and falls right through the cheese

42:25.680 --> 42:30.120
She gets up and starts running. Yeah, so immediately draw my side

42:32.180 --> 42:34.020
Zombie

42:34.020 --> 42:39.620
So they take her they take her away and you can probably call Ray and have him take care of the cleanup crew and everything

42:39.740 --> 42:43.440
But what do you what do you do? I'm going to go get my car bourbon

42:43.440 --> 42:48.500
Oh, yeah, take a swig out of that to steady my nerves and then I'm gonna check her car out

42:48.500 --> 42:51.260
I'm gonna do a search probable cause out the ass

42:51.780 --> 42:53.660
Yeah, so yeah

42:53.660 --> 42:59.460
You're good to check the car when you're going through it in the back seat of the car is a it's a Polaroid

42:59.780 --> 43:06.980
Camera and it seems to be from early early Polaroid camera making days. You've never seen a camera like this

43:06.980 --> 43:09.900
It's got the normal like chunkiness to it

43:09.900 --> 43:16.060
But it's got some like weird glass tubes that go around it and on it is a light

43:16.580 --> 43:21.660
that is red and it has a viewfinder and a button to take pictures and

43:21.900 --> 43:27.540
Then a spot for the paper to go in and a spot for the paper to come out and then all these glass tubes

43:27.980 --> 43:34.940
Probably two or three that like loop around from like one into the other and stuff there any Polaroid sitting around other also

43:34.940 --> 43:39.660
Yeah, I forgot to mention there is a Polaroid sitting in the seat of the car

43:40.100 --> 43:46.020
In the shotgun seat. It is a Polaroid. It shows the base of a tall building and a group

43:46.620 --> 43:48.860
Crowding the entrance with fists raised

43:49.460 --> 43:56.940
Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black

43:57.020 --> 44:01.500
The entire picture is not fully like colorized

44:01.500 --> 44:08.140
It almost seems black and white but the the light from the torches is giving off some sort of like a yellowy

44:08.220 --> 44:14.500
Orangish tint would you say maybe perhaps a sepia? Yeah, almost a sepia tone on this picture

44:14.500 --> 44:21.540
Does that strike you as odd that strikes John is very odd and he goes and takes another fortify and swig off his bourbon

44:21.540 --> 44:23.720
Go ahead and roll a sanity check for me

44:24.560 --> 44:25.840
Hard fail, okay

44:25.840 --> 44:31.920
So you're gonna lose one sanity and you're gonna need to take that pull instead of just wanting to

44:32.200 --> 44:38.360
Off of the old whiskey. So yeah, this is really weird. Like you've never seen anything like this

44:38.440 --> 44:44.480
You've probably not messed with Polaroids too much in your life, but you definitely know that if

44:45.120 --> 44:50.600
It shouldn't look like this. Yeah, are there any blank? There's paper in the in the camera, okay

44:50.600 --> 44:54.780
I want to try to take a picture you click on the button and nothing happens

44:55.200 --> 45:00.200
you do notice that on this camera where the red light is coming from there is also a

45:00.600 --> 45:04.480
Unlit green light next to it. So the red light is illuminated. Yes. Gotcha

45:05.060 --> 45:07.880
Okay, do I see and like an attachment or anything?

45:07.880 --> 45:13.040
That's supposed to go into this or a place for that to go somewhere that might activate that green light

45:13.040 --> 45:16.560
No, okay does not look like it. Can I just push it push what the green light?

45:16.560 --> 45:18.600
It's not a button looks like this is not a button

45:18.600 --> 45:22.440
There are two lights side by side one has a red cover

45:22.600 --> 45:26.760
Basically one is colored red and the other one is colored green and the red light is shining

45:26.760 --> 45:31.460
The green light is not just want to move the camera around and point it at different things and see if that changes

45:31.520 --> 45:37.960
What light okay, John Lee Pettymore is standing on the side of the road as a light mist comes down in the darkness

45:37.960 --> 45:43.900
He's all alone and he is standing with a camera that is odd in his hands

45:44.180 --> 45:47.820
Aiming it at different things and looking at nothing in particular

45:49.900 --> 45:53.220
Wow, nothing happened, but it sounded horrifying

45:55.820 --> 46:02.180
Yeah, nothing changes, okay as you go through the rest of the car you get to the trunk and in the trunk are

46:03.500 --> 46:05.500
multiple gas cans and

46:05.700 --> 46:09.360
A bunch of lighters and matches classic firebug. Yes

46:09.480 --> 46:13.880
Oh and also inside the car I make a note of that inside the car was a bottle of

46:15.640 --> 46:19.420
Brandy bottle of cheap brandy about half gone. Do you take a swig?

46:20.840 --> 46:25.640
Not my brand my brand so cutting back to the two of you in the junkyard is special liver

46:26.240 --> 46:29.360
Where did we leave you guys? I guess we found that note and

46:30.600 --> 46:36.980
I got the fingerprints and a piece of her hair that I'm planning on running. What's the coroner's name here? This is the county

46:36.980 --> 46:41.860
Yeah, you can just call the county. Okay, let's give them a call. See if they can figure out

46:41.860 --> 46:46.980
I mean, I think I know what killed this person, but let's see what that what their professional opinion is

46:46.980 --> 46:52.260
What's your theory their faces smashed them to death? How do you think that happened?

46:53.420 --> 46:58.540
That's what that's what I want to find out doesn't sound like you have a theory then or know how this person got killed

46:58.540 --> 47:01.740
Oh, I know that they got killed because their faces smashed

47:01.740 --> 47:07.100
That's that's what I got cause of death being a face smash cause of death smashed face

47:07.100 --> 47:12.820
Yeah, I mean that'll do it for sure. Yeah, I certainly wouldn't want my face smash like this

47:12.820 --> 47:16.380
Yeah, I'm done with that. They call it call the corner in I'm gonna do a little search around like it

47:16.780 --> 47:22.340
And maybe like a 50-foot radius around this body and see if I can find anything of interest. Okay, cool

47:22.340 --> 47:28.260
I want to go into the office. That's right there. Okay, sounds good. First off you give me a

47:28.900 --> 47:30.900
search role I

47:31.060 --> 47:38.020
Do not pass you do not find anything and Joe Clark Bishop is walking up to the

47:39.260 --> 47:46.180
Building the front door of this building and it is unlocked. I go in it is a small room

47:46.260 --> 47:47.620
There's only one room

47:47.620 --> 47:54.360
There's a desk that is like literally covered in papers and garbage and a bunch of shit just everywhere

47:54.620 --> 47:58.740
There's a couple chairs in there that are also covered with shit and there's a bunch of filing cabinets

47:58.900 --> 48:03.420
This place is deeply disorganized and no one has been in here in a while

48:04.060 --> 48:06.060
I'm just looking to are there any

48:06.380 --> 48:12.620
Surveillance anythings any TVs that look like they were at least once surveillance. There is one camera

48:12.620 --> 48:16.860
It is in the corner of the room. Can I follow its cord to see where it goes?

48:16.860 --> 48:21.800
Yeah, and you would also see that it does point at the front door, which looks out the window

48:22.600 --> 48:26.520
Cool, but I mean I want to see where it's Oh where it's hooked up. Yeah. Yeah

48:26.520 --> 48:33.540
So I underneath the desk is like the CCTV I turn on the TV. Mm-hmm. Do I get a picture?

48:33.720 --> 48:40.440
Yes, is there a VCR anywhere nearby? Oh, yeah, it is connected. It's one of those TV VCR combos

48:42.160 --> 48:44.840
So this is Joe doesn't know this would a

48:45.280 --> 48:49.040
Police officer to look at the tape in that VCR. Would he take it back to the shop?

48:49.040 --> 48:52.980
You can do whatever you want. I guess I'll do I'll just leave it there. Whatever you like

48:53.300 --> 49:00.040
I'll look at it there. Okay, I rewind go ahead and roll luck to see if it was recording

49:06.700 --> 49:11.220
Baby it was not recording. Yeah, that would have really helped

49:12.060 --> 49:17.660
I pop in from my search and I say hey have you found where that camera leads to?

49:17.660 --> 49:19.940
Maybe I can do a roll and see if it was

49:23.580 --> 49:25.840
Talks about life in a really weird way

49:29.820 --> 49:32.140
No, that's how that's how life works cool

49:32.220 --> 49:37.100
So you guys at this point could you could have ray come out and watch this scene for the night?

49:37.100 --> 49:43.180
Also, I want to give the chief a ring. Okay. Yeah, you you phone the Chiefs. Do you call her?

49:43.180 --> 49:50.080
I guess her cell phone. Yeah, it goes straight to voicemail. No ring. I want to leave a voicemail. Hey Maggie, it's

50:07.560 --> 50:10.440

51:12.120 --> 51:15.180
Okay, so we haven't seen John in a minute

51:16.140 --> 51:20.020

51:20.020 --> 51:23.500
What did that note that you found say again? We is striking when the land?

51:24.300 --> 51:28.740

Her face is all smashed to hell. Wait, this face is smashed to hell too. I think it's what it could be

51:48.260 --> 51:50.260
Well, how did her face get smashed?

51:52.520 --> 51:58.780
Poor driving was she drunk or what was it? Are you drunk? I never know these days vigna

51:58.780 --> 52:03.980
You should have seen this face. This is got me pretty shook. Well, do you need what are you doing right now?

52:03.980 --> 52:06.740
Do you need help? I'm just trying to make this camera work

52:07.480 --> 52:10.620
Okay, let's I'm gonna let's go see what he's up to

52:11.540 --> 52:15.140
So the three of you go back to the office the police department after

52:15.520 --> 52:19.900
Ray is gonna take care of cleaning up the car on the side of the road. That's been smashed

52:19.900 --> 52:22.980
He's gonna call a tow truck and let everybody know what needs to be taken care of there

52:22.980 --> 52:25.500
Well, it's about time he did something. Yeah, he's also gonna

52:25.940 --> 52:30.380
Go out to the junkyard and keep watch over the crime scene for the night, which you put up crime tape and all that

52:30.780 --> 52:35.900
Jazz, I wanted to express to Ray that we do want the coroner to like autopsy won't be one

52:36.900 --> 52:44.380
Of course yeah, and so I you'll get that report back in the morning and the three of you meet back up at the police department

52:44.500 --> 52:47.900
You're probably all out in the parking lot now is about when you would either

52:47.900 --> 52:48.840
I don't know

52:48.840 --> 52:55.560
Do you guys to have personal cars or do you take your your cruisers back to your homes Clark definitely takes his cruiser back?

52:55.560 --> 53:01.420
Yeah, I do. Yeah, so the three of you are all in your cruisers and you pull back into the police department's parking lot

53:01.420 --> 53:04.140
I walk in and talk to drew the

53:04.740 --> 53:10.560
Secretary hey, hey drew. Hey, you see the chief tonight. No, she hasn't come back in since she left abruptly

53:10.560 --> 53:16.820
She she call her anything. She did not call. Hmm. He like looks through his messages. She did not call

53:16.820 --> 53:17.220
All right

53:17.220 --> 53:22.700
Will you give her a ring and if you if you get a hold of her you gotta tell her we got some stuff going on

53:22.700 --> 53:25.500
here absolutely and then Clark goes to his desk and

53:25.660 --> 53:31.940
He starts doing whatever he can in the office with the fingerprints and so you can basically send that stuff in

53:31.940 --> 53:33.740
okay to County and

53:33.740 --> 53:38.300
Get results back later. I'm doing that Clark you you like to take those crime scene photos and things

53:38.300 --> 53:40.580
Mm-hmm. Can you have you ever seen a camera this queer?

53:40.580 --> 53:46.580
I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before it looks kind of old with the glass tubing like that

53:46.580 --> 53:51.260
I know they used to use that some of them old radio. Yeah, but this this ain't a radio Clark. Yeah

53:52.700 --> 53:56.740
This is a weird one this picture mean anything to you I look at the picture you look at the picture

53:56.740 --> 54:02.260
I want to look at the picture. The picture is a Polaroid of a base of a tall building

54:02.620 --> 54:06.300
There's a group of people crowding the entrance their fists are raised

54:06.500 --> 54:13.940
Everything in the picture is lit by torches in some of the people's hands and the building is a slightly shiny pitch black

54:14.420 --> 54:19.860
But the only coloring that you see is from the torches and it's like an orange ish yellowish hue

54:19.860 --> 54:21.860
Everything else is black and white roll sanity

54:23.660 --> 54:29.540
Pass I pass. Okay, you both don't see anything out of the ordinary with from this picture

54:29.540 --> 54:31.860
Do I recognize the building by any chance a place?

54:31.860 --> 54:37.140
All right, where'd you get this picture and honestly you wouldn't be able to recognize the pic the base of the building

54:37.140 --> 54:39.140
anyways, because it's literally just like

54:40.700 --> 54:46.420
Like an out an exterior wall, what was the driver's name? I assume we looked at her wallet and stuff

54:46.420 --> 54:50.580
Yeah, yeah for sure. Her name is Julie Maxwell. She lives in town. I got this

54:50.580 --> 54:53.980
I got this from Julie Maxwell's car. Wait, does that the car you pulled over?

54:53.980 --> 54:59.500
Yeah, Julie was the one that called in about the body. Yeah, she's not gonna be doing many calls with that face anymore

54:59.500 --> 55:02.540
Is she do we know her? Is she at the hospital right now?

55:02.540 --> 55:07.280
She is she stable or she are we gonna be able to talk to her? You don't know I can call up there

55:07.420 --> 55:13.700
Okay. Yeah, let's find out also that note said something about torches. I read the note out loud. That's ominous

55:16.100 --> 55:18.740
Well, I chant the note

55:19.740 --> 55:25.060
This has got to be connected if Julie called in the body. She's got a picture of her

55:25.500 --> 55:32.220
Is she in the picture we found a note mentioning mentoring torches we found a picture of

55:32.860 --> 55:40.740
Torches one woman's face was smashed another woman's face was split entwined. What was Julie wearing?

55:41.420 --> 55:45.380
Did you see the body her not alive? Have you seen her by a live body?

55:46.740 --> 55:48.740
What was her are you asking me?

55:49.740 --> 55:51.140
Looking like

55:51.140 --> 55:54.460
What was her clothing looking like let me stop to recollect

55:55.300 --> 55:57.300
picture a single

55:57.580 --> 56:00.340
Middle-aged woman who is stuck in the 80s

56:01.020 --> 56:06.580
Now you remember your old friend Stacy and her mom. Mm-hmm. Wait. No Stacy's mom has got it going on

56:06.780 --> 56:09.380
Who's the one who still thinks it's 1985?

56:12.700 --> 56:18.480
She reminded me a lot of your friend's mom who still thinks it's 1985. Oh, yeah, Carol

56:19.220 --> 56:21.220
Yeah, she's got Carol hair

56:21.580 --> 56:26.980
Carol hair Carol clothes. All right, cuz our body it looked like homemade stuff. I kind of wondered if they were together

56:27.100 --> 56:29.100
It's got to be connected. Sure

56:29.740 --> 56:33.540
But maybe our Julie's a suspect here. It's getting pretty late at this point

56:33.540 --> 56:37.500
You guys might want to call it for the night and can I can I go ahead and call the hospital though?

56:37.500 --> 56:43.300
Just to see for sure. She's unconscious. Okay, she's but still alive. Yeah, like not gonna die. Hey, let me roll

56:43.300 --> 56:45.300
Oh god

56:45.540 --> 56:48.300
Oh, yeah, no, she's dead Julie Maxwell's

56:49.100 --> 56:52.860
She's a cop to severe blood loss. She's dead. She's just rolled a hundred

56:53.980 --> 56:58.220
She's dead. Hey, remember when you said let me roll. It would have been tight if you

57:00.180 --> 57:06.740
Know Julie Maxwell's dead. There was probably there was probably nothing more to gather from that thread. So yeah, I

57:07.980 --> 57:11.540
Think we can call this one case closed drive safely folks

57:12.460 --> 57:15.020
I'm gonna go home. All right, take it all

57:15.820 --> 57:17.820
Sleeper and think about what I've seen today

57:18.180 --> 57:22.940
This was my first dead body and I'm kind of creeped but also a little bit stoked. Oh, yeah

57:22.940 --> 57:26.980
Hey, go ahead and roll me a sanity for seeing that dead body. I forgot to have you roll that

57:26.980 --> 57:32.620
I got an 87 that should be good right? No, I don't think so. What's your sanity 50?

57:32.620 --> 57:35.380
yeah, so you're gonna want to head and lose one and

57:36.620 --> 57:40.900
Just a quick note for you guys. We're gonna run this as a sanity

57:40.900 --> 57:46.580
We'll run as like a humanity tracker to see how much you care about

57:47.140 --> 57:54.060
Humanity everything that you see that makes you doubt the like goodness and humanity will make you lose

57:54.300 --> 58:00.360
Sanity also anything that makes you think that maybe humanity isn't all that's here will make you lose sanity

58:00.580 --> 58:07.400
So that's how we'll be tracking it. I feel a little less like I give a shit about people. Yeah, I think so

58:07.400 --> 58:12.880
Hey Keith, who do you know in town? Like who are your friends? Who's your family? Do you have anyone?

58:12.880 --> 58:18.320
I've got well my parents. I grew up go ahead and eat that mic. Go ahead and get up on so

58:19.640 --> 58:21.640
Don't eat mine

58:21.840 --> 58:27.360
Yeah, I grew up here, but my parents both passed away. I don't really have

58:28.360 --> 58:34.800
Any like close family? I've only been here a couple months. So I haven't really made friends

58:34.800 --> 58:39.040
I don't hang out with people really the only time I see other people is when I'm at work

58:39.040 --> 58:42.800
What's your dog's name? My dog's name is bean. I

58:43.440 --> 58:50.120
Didn't know if you knew this or not. But uh, it looks like I'm a I'm a distant relative of of those bean boys

58:51.080 --> 58:56.940
What what the bean boys the bean boys bean pond stuff you you have?

58:57.360 --> 59:02.040
Ancestral roots to the the one of the founders of this town, correct Amundo

59:02.760 --> 59:05.160
Cornelius beans Cornelius beans was my

59:05.800 --> 59:11.660
Ancestor grades grandpa is in your blood line. He's in my blood line between two and four grades

59:12.760 --> 59:18.780
Depending on how quickly they fucked more kids out. I named my dog beans. You poop kids out you fuck them in

59:18.780 --> 59:22.520
Oh, that's right. My bad. So your dog's name is beans

59:22.520 --> 59:26.960
What kind of dog is it golden retriever and on a scale of how much you love it? It's a lot probably

59:26.960 --> 59:30.000
It's probably like a 10. So when you get home that night

59:32.200 --> 59:36.600
Being great to at the door. Oh, hell yeah. That's sheen bean. Hey bean

59:39.280 --> 59:41.680
And that is the most genuine role-playing

59:44.560 --> 59:49.900
I'll play I'll be being I he licks my face and I'm like

59:54.920 --> 59:59.400
What's your like what's your nightly thing? Like what do you do when you I'm gonna cook dinner

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:06.080
Eat my dinner while I watch TV. Yeah, probably fall asleep in my lazy boy. Sounds good. What are you doing?

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.760
Clark doesn't have a lot in life. Yeah, but he's got his house. Mm-hmm

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:17.840
he comes home and he cooks his TV dinner in the microwave and he sits down with his TV tray and watches Wheel of Fortune and

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.300
he

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:24.920
Sometimes gets the puzzle before I was gonna say does he play along or does he just watch it for fun every now?

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.180
And then he gets a puzzle right before anybody else does nice

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.560
I was kind of thinking this guy's a real lonely sad guy for sure. No, that absolutely makes sense

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.540
We can he maybe maybe he has a connection with a checkout counter exactly

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.640
Yeah, a guy at the checkout at the grocery store

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:48.000
I love it just kind of they exchange pleasantries does he knows we know each other's names and we kind of know each other's hobbies

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.000
Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. No, that's perfect. That's absolutely perfect. So what are you doing with your night?

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.960
watching Wheel of Fortune beautiful and

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.600
John Lee Pettymore John stays back a little bit and he

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.560
Can't really shake this picture. Yeah, he's just kind of looking at it

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.200
And he probably stays in the station maybe half an hour 40 minutes after everybody leaves

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.760
Just trying to get his thoughts together. Mm-hmm. And then he goes he leaves

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.880
He leaves home and he hits up a local bar. Okay, Lee not leaves home leaves the station. Yeah in uniform

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.080
No, okay sit in my cities. Okay, he's wearing he's wearing tight wranglers a

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.840
Tucked in pearl snap. Yeah, and a pretty fucking sick leather jacket

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.560
TBH very cool. I'm not gonna say TBH again. I'll get listeners

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.400
So you go to clinkers the local bar

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.680
It's a small bar and all the windows on the outside are blacked out

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:51.160
But there are neon lights on the outside with different bush light Miller light Coors light signs neon signage

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.920
And on the inside it is a smoky small room

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:01.560
With three tables and a pool table and a bar Harry is behind the bar as per usual

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.680
Harry clinker owner of clinkers and

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.120
There's a couple regulars in there. Nobody too important to the town couple guys playing pool

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.240
I mean his night he's gonna he's gonna get him a little light and a slice of lime and he's gonna play ball by himself

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.880
all right, the next day you guys go into the office and

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.760
Immediately

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760
Drew has a couple messages for you

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.400
One a city council members dog is missing

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.600
to there's a house on the south side of the old neighborhood where the doors swinging open and mail is piling up and

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.080
Three there is an oil spill out southeast of town on a country road last night

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.600
So it's three different calls that came in. Can you can you expand on that oil spill?

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.040
Yeah, let's see who called that in. Let me check my notes real quick

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.000
Jimmy Sanders called it in and you would know that Jimmy Sanders is an old buddy of yours

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
maybe even a relative not sure and

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:58.880
He is like kind of an old hippie and he is the manager of Subtropolis the sub shop downtown

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:04.280
Yeah, no Jimmy. Jimmy Sanders called that in at like 4 in the morning last night

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.920
And yeah, he said there was an oil spill out out there in the country red. Where's that house at?

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.920
What house the house?

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.520
It's on the south side of the old neighborhood which is in the southwest part of town

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.920
I'm gonna go check out that house anybody want to come with me or should we just all get this all taken care of separately?

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.880
Also, I think there were a few things you wanted to check when you when you

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.440
So you've got those three things that came in and then you know that Julie

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.180
Maxwell is gone. She's no longer with us has a chief come in today. I know she hasn't come in

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:40.520
I tried to call her a couple times. It went straight to voicemail. I think you really got her probably hit her home

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.380
Do you do you guys like that? I'm gonna be a constant character in this game and I sound like this

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600
Well, you're better than right

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.680
What were you wanting to find out today?

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:57.840
I forgot if we got any hits on the fingerprints of the hair autopsy or anything or the autopsy. Yeah, okay

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.840
So we'll do this in order. Nothing came back on the fingerprints. This one is in no zero databases the hair

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400
Also, nothing came back

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.320
DNA wise not in any databases the autopsy report came in and

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.720
She's dead. She is dead. She died from blunt trauma

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.800
Hell yeah, dude

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.840
Which is one way? Oh my god

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.080
Which is I was gonna say another way to say face smashing do you guys wanna smoke me?

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.240
Yes, it was blunt trauma and hell yeah, dude

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.240
Blunt trauma would actually be a pretty fucking great like stoner metal or

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:46.680
On the autopsy report. Yeah, she died from blunt trauma. Hell, yeah, but also

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.480
She had a brand on her back that her skin was

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.680
Branded and it said this is a fool in all capital letters

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.880
Clark Clark on the phone is like yikes

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.880
And they can see where some pictures if you want yeah, dude, was it a fresh brand it was a

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.500
relatively fresh brand like adidas

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.840
More fly than fresh so real quick. I'll give you the rundown one more time. Carrie pages called and said that her dog is missing

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.840
Mildred Mitchell called and

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:30.860
Said that there was a house on the south side of the old neighborhood where the door is swinging open and mail is piling up

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.920
and

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.920
Who was the last guy?

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.280
John Sullivan, did you say Jimmy Sanders?

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:44.760
So close Jimmy Sanders called about an oil spill out southeast of town on Country Road

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.160

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.080
Does anyone want to roll with me or you guys gonna go check out the let's split up here?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.800

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:57.080
Yeah, I'm gonna go check out the house cuz I don't know the councilwoman or or Jimmy

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:03.040
So I'm gonna go to the it would it would be best if we sent someone's pretty senior to the councilwoman

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.600
The only thing I was gonna say is that I think Clark would feel like a missing dog is way beneath him

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:13.840
I well that depends like in this town. Do we get a call from like a council member and like yeah, that's true

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.320
That's true. All right. Yeah, I'll go to carries. Okay, I'm going in the house. Okay drew what kind of damn

Thank you lazy son of a bitch

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.920
It's getting a little weird I feel like we might be dealing with some sort of cult here

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.340
It seems like we've got a hillbilly murder cult

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.800
Something's driving the dogs crazy and faces are hurt

01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:02.760
