00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
Welcome, babies one and all.

00:02.680 --> 00:05.360
Welcome, rabies one and all.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.080
Get them shots before you foam at the mouth.

00:08.080 --> 00:16.320
It's Wolf the Dog, here to administer your rabies medication live from 694.2 PTBB.

00:16.320 --> 00:22.160
I don't accept insurance, but I'll gladly accept your soul as payment.

00:22.160 --> 00:29.280
We wanted to give a few special shout-outs before we dip into this very special Plot Talk episode.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.520
Spoilers abound, y'all.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.520
First, check out our Reddit.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.600
It's filled with a fun community.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.640
You can find that at reddit.com r slash pretending to be people.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.920
You can find a link to the Discord in there somewhere.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.960
Come chat with us and hang out a little bit.

00:46.960 --> 00:52.960
Also, go on over to twitch.tv slash pretending pod streams.

00:52.960 --> 00:58.400
I've heard some dummy named Justin has been trying to stream more often lately.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.520
And some of those other pretending to be people boys sometimes join in on the fun.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.240
I wish I knew what streaming was.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.440
Sounds like it involves a lot of liquid.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.640
And you know I'm always all about that.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.160
But that all is besides the point.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.960
The point is that this episode is about discussing the finer points.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.320
What is the point?

01:22.320 --> 01:23.920
Where are we even?

01:23.920 --> 01:26.000
Where do we go when we sleep?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Am I human after all?

01:29.440 --> 01:30.400
Probably not.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.560
But anyway, it seems these pretending to be people boys

01:34.560 --> 01:39.840
finally figured out how to record from a distance at the scientist's insistence.

01:39.840 --> 01:47.040
So with no more resistance, I howl out for assistance from the tune that fuels this wolf's existence.

01:47.040 --> 01:53.600
It's kudzu with no back bone.

01:56.000 --> 02:25.760
5, 6, 7, clap.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.240
My last clap hit my fingertips a little, but it should be still loud enough.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.040
That second one sounded like we did it in such unison

02:33.040 --> 02:35.920
that I actually didn't think anyone else did it except me.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.040
I think it was perfect, yeah.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.760
Even the video aligned beautifully.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.560
But also when I'm editing these, it makes me sound like the Dumbo.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.760
Because if you're all set to this clap one, then you're all together.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.680
And I'm slightly off from you.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.200
So you say something and then I'm like...

02:57.680 --> 02:58.720
Good one, Thomas.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.160
Just like a little bit too late.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.040
Anywho, I'll just match it up with the Zoom call and it'll all be good.

03:07.040 --> 03:07.680
Hell yeah.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.600
Getting it figured out.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.600
Let me know when to go, daddy.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.480
Oh, son, it is game time.

03:16.480 --> 03:23.440
Hello everyone and welcome to the pretending to be people plot talk Q&A episode.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.280
How's everyone doing on this beautiful spring day?

03:27.280 --> 03:28.240
Real good.

03:28.240 --> 03:28.800
Good.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.520
Doing good.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.720
I'm living large and I'm in charge.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.600
Now, Zach, I'm going to need you to talk less because I am in charge of the podcast now.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.640
You gave me the power and it will never come back.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.440
Y'all just want to hop into some of these questions.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.600
We got a whole lot of them to get through today.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.760
Yeah, let's do it.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.360
No, that's okay if we don't want to.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.160
So first question.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.760
Oh, do you want, do we, should we do a description of what we're about to do today?

03:59.760 --> 04:02.960
Well, Luke and I are too busy changing our Zoom backgrounds.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.460
Yeah.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.040
Oh man.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.000
Read this.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.920
Luke's is reminding me of playing enter the matrix and it really

04:12.640 --> 04:14.320
makes me want to bust out my PS2.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.080
Read this stuff right above my head.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.400
No.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.480
I, a hacker, enter my world.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.680
You call us criminals.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.200
This is my manifesto.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.120
Oh no.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.000
This is creepy.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.680
Is it actually a manifesto?

04:31.680 --> 04:33.680
This says I didn't show it.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.320
Show my work.

04:34.320 --> 04:39.840
Did you just Google image search manifesto and then set it as your background matrix?

04:42.560 --> 04:44.960
I like the thing that says damn kids.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.240
They're all alike.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.040
And then I can see hacker question mark.

04:52.000 --> 04:52.880
Tasteless.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.960
Thomas has a very, very cute Murphy behind him.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.080
Oh, I love him.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.360
We love Murphy.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.600
I shouldn't say I love, we all love Murphy.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.680
Which one should I set it to for the rest though?

05:03.680 --> 05:04.720
I got quite a few.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.680
What's your favorite?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.800
Oh, I couldn't possibly choose that one.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.840
Yeah, that one's a good one.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.720
Yeah, I lied.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.600
That one's the best.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.800
This one's pretty good.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.840
We all chose Ainsley.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.840
Please get Ainsley.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.120
Eats the Hills.

05:18.000 --> 05:18.320
There we go.

05:18.320 --> 05:18.800
Thank you.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.360
There it is.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.240
Not a baby eats a boy.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.080
How do we have like what, three or four questions to do?

05:25.040 --> 05:28.320
Yeah, just, just one or two, one or two quick ones.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.480
So yeah, let's get to it then.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.080
So we can really goof off.

05:34.240 --> 05:41.120
So for anyone who's new to the podcast, maybe now isn't a good time to jump in.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.400
Yeah, don't be here right now.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.200
Yeah.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.640
Go back to the first one.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.560
Maybe this is the best time to grasp as much as you can.

05:49.120 --> 05:54.720
Oh yeah, you can form a study guide and then go back to the beginning and re-listen to everything.

05:54.720 --> 05:59.360
If you're one of those people who reads the last page of every book you read before you read it,

05:59.360 --> 06:02.080
then yeah, then we don't want you listening to a podcast.

06:03.120 --> 06:03.840
Fuck you.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.920
This is going to be, uh, extreme spoiler heavy.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.680
Spoilers you may not have even known existed before today.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.480
Well, hopefully we're going to avoid some of that.

06:14.480 --> 06:20.800
Basically what I'm going to reinforce here is going to be a look back at many of the

06:20.800 --> 06:26.240
things we've forgotten and then basically just like theories and opinions from each

06:26.240 --> 06:31.440
of the players on what is happening and what their plans are moving forward.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.320
Luke just vaped in against the zoom green screen.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.360
It looked fucking awesome.

06:35.360 --> 06:43.360
All right guys, uh, first question comes from Glue B and it says,

06:43.360 --> 06:47.520
what NPCs besides Drew do you trust the most?

06:47.520 --> 06:48.880
None of them anymore.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.680
Probably, um, oh, what's his face?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.120
Daily.

06:53.120 --> 06:53.760
Gary Daily.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.880
That's a really good answer.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.160
At the Daily-fa.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.840
Daily and, and clinker.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.880
Yeah, I definitely trust him.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.400
Harry clinker of clinkers.

07:00.480 --> 07:06.240
Who's the one that saw us or like put a spell on us when we were kids or something?

07:06.240 --> 07:07.200
Uh, clinker, right?

07:07.760 --> 07:08.960
Because it was in his daycare.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.520
It wasn't his daycare, but it was his partner Gary Daily.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.320
Okay, cool.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.000
Yeah, that's my answer.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.720
Yeah, that's a, that's a good dude.

07:18.720 --> 07:23.600
We should, once we go back to contention, if we do, we'll probably get in contact with him.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.520
And, and John Lee Pettymore still trusts his family.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.880
Thomas, you actually asked the question when I had you guys ask questions and I would answer

07:32.880 --> 07:39.280
them in dreams for you, uh, in which I really didn't answer the questions, but, uh, just

07:39.280 --> 07:42.720
made weird fucked up dreams surrounding the idea of your question.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.960
You asked if you could trust Gary Daily and Harry clinker.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.480
And that's when you, that's where the scene of him putting the spell on us was, right?

07:52.480 --> 07:52.960
Yeah.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.600
And you also saw like his grandpa.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.640
You later confirmed in a phone call on the way to the city.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.240
You saw him like with the book.

08:02.240 --> 08:02.560
Yeah.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.280
He was, he was like, grandpa, you old wizard.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.080
Joe, write that down so we can get back to it.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.720
When we, what about you, Joe?

08:12.720 --> 08:18.480
Clark definitely still, uh, has a lot of trust in Maggie just because of how their relationship

08:18.480 --> 08:20.160
was before all the shit hit the fan.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.840
He also has a little bit of trust in old Clark just because it's old him.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.480
Like he sees his own face and thinks that I would, why would old me want to fuck me over?

08:31.600 --> 08:37.760
And, uh, uh, until recently, I think, uh, Leon was high on his trust list and maybe

08:37.760 --> 08:42.880
he's questioning that a little more these days, but yeah, a lot of, a lot of trust in

08:42.880 --> 08:43.680
Maggie for sure.

08:44.640 --> 08:44.880
Oh.

08:44.880 --> 08:52.000
And, uh, he, he also still feels pretty strongly about his, uh, his, uh, fellow officers.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.840
I don't think that he has a, a lot of mistrust in them right now.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.600
I'd say the same for Keith.

08:57.600 --> 08:57.920
Yeah.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.360
Oh, uh, my niece, my niece, for sure.

09:03.280 --> 09:03.840
Your niece.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.040
She's family, you know,

09:11.280 --> 09:12.080
bigger than blood.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.000
Keith can trust anyone who he's killed because they can't betray him.

09:20.560 --> 09:25.840
Um, this next one comes from the lay suit for the boys.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.960
That's how I would say it.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.480
I think, yeah, I think it's Lejuet.

09:29.200 --> 09:29.680
The Lejuet.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.200
Oh, I wouldn't.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.880
Or Lejuet.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.040
Yeah.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.960
Like a, like a leisure Jesuit.

09:34.960 --> 09:35.760
Maybe.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.160
Maybe.

09:37.200 --> 09:37.760
Yeah.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.680
Oh, my mom was a leisure Jesuit.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.560
Oh, I'll say.

09:42.560 --> 09:48.400
They write for the boys, what hooks slash bangs do you wish you had followed up on?

09:48.960 --> 09:51.280
And what are some of your favorite bangs?

09:51.840 --> 09:56.240
Uh, I wish that we would have not royally fucked up when we saw that guy in the woods.

09:56.960 --> 09:57.440
Yeah.

09:57.440 --> 09:57.760
Yeah.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.240
Great one.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.240
That was, that was all about the roles though.

10:00.240 --> 10:00.880
Kinda.

10:00.880 --> 10:01.120
Yeah.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.200
I mean, we didn't necessarily do anything wrong.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.800
We just rolled terribly.

10:04.800 --> 10:10.640
I want to say each of you rolled a critical failure, like a critical, critical failure

10:10.720 --> 10:14.320
within like five minutes of each other.

10:14.320 --> 10:19.280
Also, did we ever follow up on the note you got from the robot guy?

10:19.280 --> 10:19.840
Not really.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.600
That's one too.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.320
What did it say?

10:22.960 --> 10:24.480
Uh, hold on.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.800
I was just reading this earlier.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.120
I think, I think I know if you can't find it.

10:29.120 --> 10:33.440
Remember when we were recording both the dog and I said a robot massage, and I thought

10:33.440 --> 10:38.320
that was really funny that John Lee Fattimore was in love with a robot and got a massage

10:38.320 --> 10:45.280
from, I mean, they would be good at it.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.160
I bet if they were programmed for massaging.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.360
Yeah.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.880
You got to think about that.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.360
Well, you got to think about the build structure.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.520
I mean, you're not going to be metal, you know, if you're made from massaging, you're

10:57.520 --> 11:05.040
going to have to come up with some very, very human like parts to get in there.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.920
To really get in there.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.920
Is your chiropractor a robot, Zach?

11:09.920 --> 11:14.000
Yeah, but that's just because they're the best chiropractors.

11:14.800 --> 11:15.440
Exactly.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.480
And he's got no heart.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.480
You need a man with no heart to really crack his spine.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.560
Even if I die, my spine will be straight.

11:22.560 --> 11:22.880
Yes.

11:22.880 --> 11:27.200
And no, in the review, it just says that I sent it off to Drew to see what it says.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.960
And it says, I killed the, oh wait, sorry.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.160
Do you know it, Joe?

11:32.160 --> 11:34.640
Yeah, it's I killed the chief's pops, John.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.120
Right.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.480
That's exactly what it says.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.320
Word for word in binary.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.160
Write that down, Joe.

11:46.160 --> 11:46.960
Make a note of it.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.000
See what, who else or what else?

11:50.000 --> 11:55.120
I wrote down that I, uh, I wish we would have, um, explored the helmet some more.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.720
We, we kind of got it and tucked it away and never really researched it.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.240
I would have liked to have known more about it.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.520
Who has the helmet now?

12:01.520 --> 12:02.160
We do.

12:02.160 --> 12:02.720
Oh, fuck.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.480
Oh my God.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.040
The cat's just knocked down my, uh, soundproof blanket.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.800
Well, it made a whole lot of noise.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.360
Ironic.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.960
But yeah, for sure.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.880
The, uh, the helmet would have been interesting.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.520
I mean, you guys had a pretty long scene, uh, but none of the focus was on the helmet.

12:27.520 --> 12:33.280
It was just on, um, you know, Luke and Keith Vigna and pastor Adam Kane.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.600
Not liking, uh, each other pretty, pretty clearly.

12:38.480 --> 12:44.080
Actually, I don't even think Keith Vigna like thought about pastor Adam Kane except for himself.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.560
He gave me some food.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.480
The second part of that was what are your favorite bangs?

12:50.480 --> 12:56.400
I was a big fan the very first time we ever saw a creepy picture come out of that Polaroid camera.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.920
I don't know if you consider that a bang or not.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.600
That's pretty integral to the story, but it came out for sure.

13:01.600 --> 13:01.840
Cool.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.240
That's like a set charge, right?

13:04.240 --> 13:06.960
It's like when they use this, this will happen.

13:06.960 --> 13:12.880
It's like, I love doing this with people and locations once we're like into the game to be

13:12.880 --> 13:18.240
like, it's up to them if they want to make this happen, but if they reach out to this person,

13:18.240 --> 13:21.680
this will unlock this plot essentially.

13:21.840 --> 13:28.720
It's like, if you happen to decide to call someone, then you're going to make something

13:28.720 --> 13:33.760
happen there because you're not just going to call them and have nothing be happening, right?

13:34.560 --> 13:38.400
Something will be happening, but if you don't call them, it's up to me to decide at that point,

13:38.400 --> 13:40.960
like, well, what happened?

13:40.960 --> 13:46.640
Is it still this interesting convoluted story or would that not be as interesting because

13:46.640 --> 13:47.760
they weren't there for it?

13:48.320 --> 13:50.160
I always want you guys there for the action.

13:51.040 --> 13:57.120
So I don't know if this was a bang probably, but when Keith snuck on the bus and then all

13:57.120 --> 14:03.120
the homeless people got on and I was stuck on it and you guys know what happened.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.720
That was pretty good.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.520
That was just their like written trajectory for that scene.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.760
It's like, these people are going to do this and these are their objectives and this is

14:13.760 --> 14:14.800
how they're going to do it.

14:14.800 --> 14:18.960
And then you got into the exact bus that they were going to leave on.

14:20.160 --> 14:28.400
Thomas, did you have a good hooker bang that, that really hooked you into the door while

14:28.400 --> 14:28.960
hooking you?

14:30.880 --> 14:36.800
Leo piston and, um, what's your face's body literally being banged, uh, banged into the

14:36.800 --> 14:38.240
ground by the unseen forces.

14:39.040 --> 14:39.760
Ooh, fuck.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.320
Yeah.

14:40.320 --> 14:44.400
That was a disturbing imagery moment that I personally loved.

14:44.400 --> 14:44.640
Yes.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.440
That certainly got John Lee Pettymore's attention.

14:48.080 --> 14:48.640
That's awesome.

14:49.200 --> 14:56.480
That was one of those things where I don't plan a lot in advance for like how things

14:56.480 --> 14:57.440
are going to play out.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.080
I did not expect Clark to critically succeed on a firearms check and kill her.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.560
Old eagle eye Bishop.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.280
You know it.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.480
We got a next question here from super five-ish.

15:10.480 --> 15:15.280
Super fish or super fish with a five is a F is super five-ish says what happened to

15:15.280 --> 15:21.680
the grammar, poor torch-wielding would be invaders hinted at in the early episodes.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.280
Are they still kicking about?

15:23.280 --> 15:27.200
And this is, uh, this is in the, one of those pictures that you were talking about there,

15:27.200 --> 15:30.400
Joe, but this is the picture I believe that was well.

15:30.400 --> 15:30.720
Okay.

15:30.720 --> 15:37.520
So I, I don't, I mean, I think that that is part of what is like being alluded to, but

15:37.520 --> 15:40.880
I think he's referencing the note that we got it because when he said grammar poor,

15:41.680 --> 15:48.000
it says we are striking with darkness, reading torches, hesitate, not, um, and it says,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.360
are they still kicking about?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.320
I don't, I don't know.

15:50.320 --> 15:54.720
I assume it has something to do with the picture we saw of people holding torches, but I don't

15:54.720 --> 15:55.220
know.

15:56.080 --> 15:56.640
Yeah.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.720
I completely misread that question.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.080
I had to think about it when they, when they said grammar poor, I was like, who was grammar

16:02.080 --> 16:02.480
poor?

16:02.480 --> 16:08.560
And then I remember I thought we could all just tell from the picture of them that they

16:08.560 --> 16:09.440
looked like they didn't know.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.400
So any ideas?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.320
I, we got a question about that now.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.360
Let's just jump to it now.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.320
Where is it?

16:16.320 --> 16:24.400
A non a no, no, no asks when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where

16:24.400 --> 16:25.680
was he thrown from?

16:25.680 --> 16:28.960
Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?

16:28.960 --> 16:29.460
Yeah.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.600
I think so.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.560
I like to think so.

16:32.560 --> 16:37.120
Cause we had seen John Peters in the stocks in those pictures and it was that inky black

16:37.120 --> 16:37.840
void.

16:37.840 --> 16:42.880
So I fear he, if he was there and then not there, maybe he got spit out, but no, there's

16:42.880 --> 16:44.720
nothing being confirmed one way or the other.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.560
What's your computer notes say, Zach?

16:48.160 --> 16:50.320
It just says in all caps.

16:50.320 --> 16:50.960
Oh fuck.

16:50.960 --> 16:51.920
Come up with something.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.320
No, it's the answer.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.000
It just, I'm looking at the answer.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.440
Do you guys want me to screen share with you?

17:00.080 --> 17:06.080
I've got a question here from the leisure for me or for someone who's got a name that

17:06.080 --> 17:07.840
sounds like mine, but is spelled differently.

17:07.840 --> 17:12.880
It's for Zach with a K from the original timeline slash campaign slash thing.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.160
What dangling hooks do you wish the boys would have followed up on?

17:17.600 --> 17:23.200
Yeah, I'd probably say the grammar poor torch wielding would be invaders hinted at in the

17:23.200 --> 17:24.080
early episode.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.120
Hey Joe, write that down.

17:27.600 --> 17:31.040
By the, by the nature of the game and the story you're telling, there's nothing that

17:31.040 --> 17:34.640
we couldn't like go back and follow up on if we really felt the need to.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.400
That's absolutely correct.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.920
Things might've changed since we first saw it, but there's no reason we couldn't go and

17:40.640 --> 17:42.400
do a little more research on something.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.360
Absolutely.

17:43.360 --> 17:48.720
I think the next arc is going to start with you wake up and you're on four wheelers driving

17:48.720 --> 17:49.840
to the woods.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.880
Don't fuck up this time.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.320
Well now I've got to change it.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.280
Oh, just edit that part out.

17:57.280 --> 18:02.160
Oh, we got another question here from Maladory asks Ari Manstein feels more important than

18:02.160 --> 18:03.760
they have been given credit.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.000
What were they and why were they working with the CPD?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.440
Also, what about Jan Manstein and Stan Manstein for that matter?

18:11.440 --> 18:14.400
Why could the only the boys understand Stan at the meaner?

18:14.400 --> 18:15.920
Yeah, the fuck me.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.360
And what does he mean by our past is different?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.680
That's a loaded and a lot.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.560
I I've got it.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.360
I've got a theory.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.080
I don't know.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.040
What's your theory?

18:25.040 --> 18:26.800
Stan obviously seems super important.

18:26.800 --> 18:32.000
He was telling us a lot of really good info before we tried to kill him, but he was talking

18:32.000 --> 18:38.240
about how pasts have changed and so I mean there's some kind of timey wimey thing that

18:38.240 --> 18:42.320
for some reason we're all sure that we remember different names for Ari.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.960
He kind of alluded to the fact that that's not going to happen anymore that she's a fixed

18:46.960 --> 18:51.040
point in some way and that his his life is definite or her life is definite now.

18:51.040 --> 18:55.120
I don't know, but he seemed to know a lot about how all this timey wimey shit is working

18:55.120 --> 18:58.960
and I don't really grasp it all, but it seems super important.

18:58.960 --> 18:59.600
I agree.

18:59.600 --> 19:00.640
Hey, I've got a question.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.360
I want you all to answer it on the count of three.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.280
Who is the dentist in contention?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.840
Do you have an answer in your mind?

19:09.840 --> 19:12.960
I mean, I definitely can picture him and I know his business card.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.520
Yeah.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.120
I don't remember his name exactly.

19:15.120 --> 19:15.680
Old man.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.280
Moller?

19:17.280 --> 19:17.920
Moller?

19:19.360 --> 19:24.960
Well, so there was the the guy who told us he was a dentist, but he was helping settle

19:24.960 --> 19:27.280
the estate right of James.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.800
Yeah, he shit his pants.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.120
But that is not Dr. Moller.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.840
Right, there's a more of a real dentist or as he was not so much a dentist, maybe is

19:35.840 --> 19:37.520
what we gathered from his card.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.120
When did we meet a real dentist?

19:39.120 --> 19:43.120
We didn't meet and we sent off dental records to a dentist one time.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.640
Oh, I forget for what body.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.880
It was for the body of Chief Maggie Cook.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.640
Right, in the house explosion.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.120
Yeah.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.160
What was his name?

19:52.160 --> 19:54.080
Was it another Andrews sibling?

19:55.040 --> 19:57.680
No, his name was Randy Angst.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.400
Randy Angst.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.600
The guy who was at James the mill worker's house with you guys.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.120
His business card said dentist and lover or something like that, right?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.360
And historical society.

20:07.360 --> 20:07.840
Yeah.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.480
Yeah.

20:08.480 --> 20:13.280
But yeah, just to point out that you guys sent off dental records to the only dentist

20:13.280 --> 20:17.920
in town, Dr. Moller, and then you met a dentist named Randy Angst.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.440
Write that down.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.520
That's just a thing that happened.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.360
Probably not important though.

20:23.360 --> 20:28.480
I mean, I think we all noted it at the time that it was weird that he was settling in

20:28.480 --> 20:32.480
a state and his card had like four different occupations on it.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.360
But yeah, I don't know.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.400
Yeah, I agree.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.720
Thomas, do you have any theories about Ari Manstein?

20:37.280 --> 20:39.200
I don't know who that is.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.400
Tim Manstein was a colleague of mine.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.160
One of the finest cops I ever knew.

20:48.640 --> 20:54.640
Um, uh, yeah, we're actually going to be attending their funeral soon.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.760
I think I got a question here from crane song.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.720
Zach, what was the decision made by the players that stands out to you as the most derailing

21:02.720 --> 21:03.840
what you had planned?

21:03.840 --> 21:07.200
We know that you parenthetical allegedly.

21:08.160 --> 21:08.800
I don't lie.

21:09.360 --> 21:14.720
Had to rewrite the campaign after someone Thomas joked about it being the mine.

21:14.720 --> 21:18.080
Were there any other parts of the campaign that had to be redone?

21:18.080 --> 21:23.280
Any really, really, really obvious plot points that the players bypassed or previously pivotal

21:23.280 --> 21:26.160
characters that were either killed or ignored?

21:26.160 --> 21:30.960
I'm just imagining Zach control effing mine and changing it to mill every time.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.120
Control H, baby.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.880
So yeah, that was Thomas who did the mine thing.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.000
And that was when I was still writing the story and I was like, yeah, you're right.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.280
I shouldn't make it that.

21:43.680 --> 21:51.600
Um, but, um, like rewritten, uh, constantly, I would, yeah, I rewrite stuff literally all

21:51.600 --> 21:52.320
the time.

21:52.320 --> 21:57.280
If you guys do something to affect my plan, then I have to rewrite everything.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.240
And that happens like every single time we sit down to play.

22:00.240 --> 22:04.480
Cause you guys are fun to play with, you make choices.

22:04.480 --> 22:09.680
And that's the thing that matters most in role-playing is, uh, we're making the story

22:09.680 --> 22:10.160
together.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.200
So every time you make a choice, I get to play with that choice.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.040
And that's why I like role-playing I'm with you.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.800
That was the question, right?

22:18.800 --> 22:19.440
Yeah.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.480
I think you got it.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.960
Obvious plot points that the players bypassed.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.760
Yeah, of course.

22:25.280 --> 22:25.760
All right.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.480
So we've got a question here.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.400
I was about to tell Joe to write it down.

22:33.120 --> 22:38.400
Oh, previously pivotal characters that were either killed or ignored, uh, just on the

22:38.480 --> 22:39.360
killed part.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.560
Like, yeah, for sure.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.040
Got a murderous crew.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.480
I like straight up for one did not think that that car chase with Charles Donovan was going

22:50.480 --> 22:52.480
to end in his murder.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.560
Who would have done that?

22:57.520 --> 23:02.560
I also didn't think you were going to murder every single person you came into contact

23:02.560 --> 23:04.800
with at city state university.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.480
They were coming right for us.

23:12.320 --> 23:12.800
Oh boy.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.480
We got one from a non, uh, no, no, no.

23:19.520 --> 23:25.680
And they said, when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where was he

23:25.680 --> 23:26.880
thrown from?

23:26.880 --> 23:29.200
Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?

23:31.920 --> 23:32.640
We did this one.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.800
Oh, well, thanks.

23:37.760 --> 23:42.160
Uh, go ahead and hit that antiseptic mouthwash goat sex picture.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.920
Just wanted to share things.

23:45.920 --> 23:50.080
And what happened to those kids that, that saw the gooey vacuum?

23:50.080 --> 23:50.480
Thanks.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.320
There were no kids.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.440
And I don't, I don't know, uh, what vacuum incident you're talking about.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.640
That's not a, that's not a thing.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.440
Joe, Joe, no, no.

23:59.440 --> 24:07.120
When we, when we got those kids killed, cause we, well, yeah.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.960
Instead of telling them to run away or something, we told them to hold a vacuum.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.960
No, we wouldn't have done that.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.680
That's ridiculous.

24:15.680 --> 24:16.480
No, they died.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.240
That's I can't believe I wasn't involved in that one.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.320
We can never let Vigna know.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.080
We really keep those kids up.

24:28.640 --> 24:36.960
Oh, so on the way to the city, you guys were on the phone with Harry Klinker on speakerphone

24:36.960 --> 24:39.200
and John told that whole story.

24:40.240 --> 24:45.520
With Keith in the car and Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent and Chad also in the car.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.880
I tried to tell Trent Chad that it was like part of his trip, right?

24:48.880 --> 24:50.560
That he was dreaming it or something.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.120
Yeah.

24:51.120 --> 24:51.600
Yeah.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.080
And then that he was like, I don't know.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.040
And he's like, no, no, no.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.800
They just talk to each other like this all the time.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.240
Yeah.

24:58.320 --> 25:05.520
We got another one from J sake, which they wanted to make sure is not pronounced J sake

25:06.320 --> 25:08.320
for audio formatting purposes.

25:08.320 --> 25:13.040
I pronounce it like quote for sake, not Japanese rice wine.

25:13.920 --> 25:20.560
J sake's question is does the daily pho have a yellow sign hanging on the wall?

25:21.200 --> 25:23.200
Ain't on a no, no, no, no.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.240
No, they commented.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.040
Are we talking a specific yellow sign?

25:29.040 --> 25:31.760
TM J state comments back.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.880
I think so.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.480
I'm doing a quarantine release.

25:35.280 --> 25:40.320
I'm doing a quarantine re listen.

25:40.320 --> 25:45.760
And when the art Gary has on the walls of the restaurant is described, it kind of sounds

25:45.760 --> 25:51.600
like one is the yellow sign, not a yellow sign, if you know what I mean, but it could

25:51.600 --> 25:53.440
be some other occult symbol.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.720
I'm not familiar with.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.640
I went back and listened to the description of all those things on the walls.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.840
And one of them definitely sounds like a yellow sign description, but none of our characters

26:03.840 --> 26:08.400
would know that like, there's no way that they would know that is what that is.

26:08.400 --> 26:15.040
I bet John Lee Pettymore saw like the first 30 minutes of the first season of true detective

26:15.680 --> 26:17.360
and didn't get it and turned it off.

26:17.360 --> 26:22.000
Oh, thankfully they use a different yellow sign.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.160
Also, the yellow sign can be anything.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.840
They can look like anything.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.760
So, but there is one that looks a whole heck of a lot.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.000
Like when I Googled yellow sign, it sounded exactly like something you described.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.840
Yeah, it does.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.480
Doesn't it?

26:39.360 --> 26:40.720
Looks like one of those things.

26:41.040 --> 26:49.680
And then when, when you asked him what that one meant, he said, oh, that one is about

26:49.680 --> 26:51.680
a land unknown.

26:51.680 --> 26:57.520
Yeah, which we, we kind of took for granted because it's described as like question marks

26:57.520 --> 27:01.840
kind of like it was a question mark with a line coming out the other side and yada, yada,

27:01.840 --> 27:02.480
yada.

27:02.480 --> 27:07.040
When I originally read that question, I thought it was a reference to like the yellow missing

27:07.040 --> 27:07.840
signs.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.720
And I was like, huh?

27:11.600 --> 27:14.000
But now I realize nothing to do with that.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.120
Speaking of nothing.

27:16.320 --> 27:16.800
Okay.

27:16.800 --> 27:20.880
Nothing for wrote us a question.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.760
Look out world.

27:21.760 --> 27:22.160
Sorry.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.680
I am a transition guy.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.400
Um, okay.

27:26.400 --> 27:30.240
Nothing for wrote a question.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.920
They wrote a question I actually was curious about too.

27:37.920 --> 27:44.400
What happened to the FBI agents who visited the contention PD and said they'd be in contact

27:44.400 --> 27:48.080
within 48 hours and Maladory followed up?

27:48.080 --> 27:53.040
Weren't the agents at the den of sin when Marvin got terminated or were those different

27:53.040 --> 27:53.760
agents?

27:53.760 --> 27:58.560
Well, didn't the FBI agents say that they would call us if we didn't call them?

27:58.560 --> 27:59.120
That's for sure.

27:59.120 --> 27:59.680
Part of it.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.600
And then we, we tried to call them.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.160
Yeah.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.120
Keith called them and got an automated, uh, system.

28:05.680 --> 28:05.920
Yeah.

28:05.920 --> 28:10.160
So we just kind of laid out that we needed to contact them, ask them stuff or something.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.920
And it just was like, thank you.

28:11.920 --> 28:12.640
Have a good day.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.760
So that thread kind of ended.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.720
And then, yeah, as far as the den of sin goes, I think that's what I'm operating under is

28:20.720 --> 28:24.480
that that was them that we saw in the audience going into Marvin's room.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.040
And I think I brought up with you guys that we don't know for sure what the fuck that

28:29.040 --> 28:29.440
means.

28:29.440 --> 28:34.560
That could mean that they are on Marvin's payroll maybe, or they had followed us into

28:34.560 --> 28:37.520
the glass compound and we're trying to help.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.160
I don't know.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.440
I don't know what they were doing there.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.760
I think we, we still would like to talk to them.

28:44.160 --> 28:52.800
And their goal in front of your eyes, like what you saw was them get rid of silver or

28:52.800 --> 28:58.880
not even get rid of, but just put one silver ball that none of them were touching into

28:58.880 --> 29:00.160
the Nike bag.

29:00.160 --> 29:04.240
Maybe the Nike bag teleported it to glass.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.200
Straight to glass.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.080
That's that could be.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.040
I think you guys have had this conversation before.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.160
I think we might've done it off the podcast one day.

29:12.160 --> 29:12.960
Oh yeah.

29:12.960 --> 29:19.760
I was reading, I was reading the overview of episode 34 and it's one where it's, I

29:19.760 --> 29:25.920
think it's right before the entity shows up to yell at Clark Bishop about the book.

29:25.920 --> 29:31.840
And you guys are all standing in the mausoleum courtyard, essentially, and just talking about

29:31.920 --> 29:33.680
the plot for the entire time.

29:33.680 --> 29:39.200
And the overview of that episode is just like intense plot point after intense plot point

29:39.200 --> 29:41.520
after intense plot point after intense plot point.

29:41.520 --> 29:46.880
So yeah, if you want to go for listeners 34, if you want to go back and listen to them,

29:46.880 --> 29:49.520
try to figure some stuff out before we hop into this.

29:49.520 --> 29:53.680
I mean, I know that's what this is, but damn, that episode is chock full of shit.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.240
Nice.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.240
I'll have to go back and listen to that one too.

29:56.240 --> 29:56.800
All right.

29:56.800 --> 30:00.320
Moving right along crush 36 rights.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.480
Who do the robots work for?

30:03.200 --> 30:08.800
Were the graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes that we fought the first robot guy and

30:08.800 --> 30:14.160
he had the, uh, so it was the double helix sees that created an M that we have like on

30:14.160 --> 30:15.200
a ring and stuff.

30:15.200 --> 30:20.080
We later found out from old Clark's Heidi hole in Jim Cook's house.

30:20.080 --> 30:20.720
It's myriad.

30:20.720 --> 30:25.760
It stands for myriad, which is a company that I think creates androids.

30:25.760 --> 30:31.680
The, it was in operation stapler that they were like cutting costs on androids.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.080
Yeah.

30:32.080 --> 30:36.880
So yeah, I don't, did we find out who myriad was or what they were, what they were associated

30:36.880 --> 30:37.520
with?

30:37.520 --> 30:40.800
Were they owned or did they own the beans corporation?

30:40.800 --> 30:42.400
I'll have to ask Keith's brother.

30:44.000 --> 30:53.600
Bruce Robin was extremely emotionally affected by Keith having a myriad ring.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.320
Oh, that's right.

30:54.320 --> 30:59.680
When we were in the office, he saw your ring and was like, oh, he, did he have one on two?

30:59.680 --> 31:01.920
He was really embarrassed by the faux pas.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.200
How dare you?

31:05.840 --> 31:07.520
He, he did have one on two, right?

31:07.520 --> 31:09.120
Cause I tried to like touch them together.

31:09.120 --> 31:09.760
I think.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.040
Or am I making that up?

31:11.040 --> 31:12.240
I don't, I don't remember.

31:12.240 --> 31:12.800
I don't either.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.160
I don't have an overview for that one.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.520
You should get on that.

31:15.520 --> 31:23.440
Then Zach, I'm just kidding for the listener.

31:23.440 --> 31:28.400
It's our job to write some of these overviews and we suck at doing that on time.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.040
We're like half the season behind.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.280
I did two of them the other day.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.640
It doesn't take very long if you listen at double speed.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.920
However, I will say one of them was already done.

31:39.920 --> 31:40.400
Shit.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.040
Which one?

31:41.040 --> 31:42.080
And Joe had done it.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.520
So it was way more in depth.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.120
I put on only the good stuff in there.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.200
I didn't write a transcript.

31:51.200 --> 31:56.640
Oh, Joe's putting a lot of fluff in those overviews.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.400
He's putting up his font size.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.880
He's not paying us by the word, Joe.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.520
I can start paying you by the word if you want.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.960
Oh, mine'll be so long.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.480
It was the best of soads.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.840
It was the worst of soads.

32:11.840 --> 32:15.520
I'm always so nervous that Zach's word choice is going to be super important.

32:15.520 --> 32:20.160
So if he says like her grimacing face,

32:20.160 --> 32:23.440
I'm going to put in that grimacing just in case that means something later.

32:24.080 --> 32:27.120
It only does like 25% of the time, but that's pretty high.

32:28.960 --> 32:32.560
And then graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.600
They weren't fish, if that was what the question was.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.120
Did we ever investigate their bodies?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.520
We didn't think they were fish, but they were weird,

32:41.520 --> 32:44.080
like alien creature kind of things, right?

32:44.080 --> 32:45.840
Oh, those boys.

32:46.800 --> 32:54.560
The long, tall, like lanky gray entity that like,

32:54.560 --> 32:57.440
and wearing a full suit screamed at Clark.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.600
It screamed at me and I didn't know what the fuck.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.240
But yeah, even at the time, I think we noted that it was,

33:02.240 --> 33:05.600
there was a similar description between them and Marvin himself.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.440
We wondered if they were of the same ilk.

33:10.480 --> 33:11.200
Yeah, man.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.400
I mean, yeah, they're described the same.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.360
They look very similar.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.400
Write that down.

33:18.400 --> 33:22.480
They don't act the same at all though, which is an important distinction.

33:22.480 --> 33:27.040
They certainly don't, but they also probably aren't human

33:27.040 --> 33:29.120
based on those descriptions that I gave.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.440
Not a lot of eight foot tall humans walking around.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.560
Not a lot, Zach, but they're out there.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.600
There are some.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.080
Enough.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.080
I don't think there's anyone eight feet tall in the world right now.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.440
What Zach is saying is that if you're over eight feet tall,

33:45.440 --> 33:47.120
he doesn't consider you human.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.320
I completely agree with that.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.840
Oh my God.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.640
Watch fucking Chuckling Boy be like eight foot five.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.720
Friendship with PTBP over.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.520
Oh boy.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.280
Speaking of, we got a question from Jayhawk Inc.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.840
More from him later or her them later.

34:11.840 --> 34:14.960
Are there any things that have quote official names

34:14.960 --> 34:17.600
that haven't been named as such in the podcast?

34:17.600 --> 34:18.240
Yes.

34:18.240 --> 34:21.840
Like I don't remember the chanting fish men being called deep ones.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.640
They weren't.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.640
And they discovered that trove of weapons,

34:24.640 --> 34:27.840
but only Joe mentioned that it was likely a green box out of character.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.080
I'm curious if we've like seen a ghoul.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.680
No, but didn't realize it was a ghoul.

34:31.680 --> 34:33.600
No, because no one called it that, you know?

34:34.560 --> 34:36.640
Yeah, probably no ghouls, but maybe.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.520
I don't know.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.240
I like to make ghouls look different than traditional ghouls.

34:40.880 --> 34:43.920
I used ghouls heavily in a former campaign.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.280
Eight foot tall.

34:45.280 --> 34:55.840
So, you know, they weren't human creatures that tortured Joe's character's family.

34:57.600 --> 35:02.240
He like woke up with like with like graveyard dirt all over him one night

35:02.240 --> 35:03.840
and was like, what's going on?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.040
That sounds just like Joe.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.880
So yeah, definitely.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.040
And also no.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.360
Maladory has one for us.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.800
So a question about ball.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.560
If ball contains consciousness of some people,

35:18.560 --> 35:22.400
how did it have John Pettymore the third's original body?

35:22.400 --> 35:28.640
Also, how come some ball seems to act with intelligence when they take a body

35:28.640 --> 35:31.360
and some kill themselves or go berserk?

35:31.360 --> 35:32.400
That's a question about ball.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.200
Excellent question about ball.

35:35.440 --> 35:39.200
So I went through all these questions and typed out just little thoughts on all of them.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.560
And this is one that I wrote.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.040
I still don't know anything about ball.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.400
Yeah, exactly.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.880
I don't understand it.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.080
No fucking clue.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.120
I don't know for sure if I'm ball or not, but it's been implied for sure.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.080
I don't know what that would mean for me or not for me.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.960
I don't know much about ball at all.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.080
Something we maybe should follow up on.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.040
I don't know how though.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.960
It seems like ball central was Marvin Glass's compound.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.680
It does seem that way.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.800
Let's head on back, boys.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.800
We can still go.

36:12.640 --> 36:21.280
No, if you'll remember, we were planning on going back there to intercept,

36:22.480 --> 36:24.800
was it the FBI agents before they got killed?

36:25.440 --> 36:28.160
We were going to talk to somebody and then Maggie showed up and she's like,

36:28.240 --> 36:29.520
this will only take two hours.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.200
And then all the university shit happened.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.520
Yeah, I don't think so.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.320
It's like the mill.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.680
Zach doesn't want us to do that.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.560
When I was reading back over the overview,

36:42.560 --> 36:47.680
I noted in one of the overviews that I wrote early on and said,

36:47.680 --> 36:50.400
they chose not to go to the mill.

36:52.080 --> 36:52.580
Wow.

36:52.580 --> 36:58.180
Well, this next one comes from crush 36.

36:58.180 --> 37:00.260
I don't know if you all have any more ball thoughts.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.460
No, no, that was perfect.

37:01.460 --> 37:05.300
I have tons of plot ball thoughts, but you know,

37:05.300 --> 37:07.860
can we, can we real fast think about all the balls we've seen?

37:11.140 --> 37:14.340
For real though, I know the first one it was in,

37:14.340 --> 37:18.420
it was in the potential green box in a tub that was filled with gore.

37:18.420 --> 37:21.700
And when we opened it, it was a woman's head in the middle of it,

37:21.700 --> 37:24.260
split open with a ball sitting in the middle of it.

37:25.060 --> 37:27.540
So that was our first encounter with ball.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.460
Ball one.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.100
Is that the ball that you had in your pocket, Thomas?

37:32.100 --> 37:32.980
I think so, right?

37:32.980 --> 37:33.700
I believe so.

37:34.260 --> 37:37.620
We've got tub head ball that then John pocketed.

37:38.260 --> 37:42.900
And then the agents McKinley and Kennedy had their own ball.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.220
When we, when we brought them the Nike bag,

37:45.220 --> 37:48.500
they brought their own ball out of their pocket and popped it into the bag.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.420
And we didn't tell them that we already had a ball.

37:50.420 --> 37:51.220
I don't think.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.140
So that's two balls we know of now.

37:54.180 --> 37:57.540
Third ball would be whatever John himself is, right?

37:57.540 --> 37:59.620
He or was the ball in his pocket.

37:59.620 --> 38:00.340
What became him?

38:00.340 --> 38:01.060
Do we know that?

38:01.060 --> 38:03.620
I don't know if my character knows that and it's been said, I don't know.

38:04.180 --> 38:06.420
So we don't have to say motherfucker.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.700
You, you did, right?

38:09.700 --> 38:12.580
Didn't you say that you were ball in your dad's body?

38:12.580 --> 38:14.420
And then you were like, I think we're all ball.

38:14.420 --> 38:17.300
I'm pretty sure that conversation happened at the cemetery.

38:17.300 --> 38:20.580
Yeah, but I'm saying if I was the ball that I picked up and put in my pocket

38:21.060 --> 38:22.820
and that's, that's how I became ball.

38:22.820 --> 38:24.100
That would, that'd be big news.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.620
I don't think that's true though.

38:25.620 --> 38:29.140
And then, so the ball that was in Marvin's possession.

38:29.140 --> 38:29.380
Right.

38:29.380 --> 38:35.220
That, uh, Rosemary flung or no Marvin flung it at Rosemary, but yeah.

38:35.220 --> 38:36.900
Do we know the origin of that ball?

38:36.900 --> 38:42.260
Do we know if that was, came out of John's pocket maybe when we were last there?

38:42.260 --> 38:47.300
Keith had seen videos of kids in rooms.

38:48.020 --> 38:51.380
They tried to get them to touch the ball and it would come kill them.

38:51.940 --> 38:55.780
So it seemed like maybe that ball had been there for a while.

38:55.780 --> 39:03.460
Cause they had tapes and tapes and tapes of kids getting, it would rip their spines out

39:03.460 --> 39:05.300
or tear them apart, right?

39:05.300 --> 39:11.780
I believe it would rip their spines out and enter them and then repeatedly slam their

39:11.780 --> 39:15.780
own head into the wall until they fell.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.020
Are those all our ball thoughts today?

39:18.020 --> 39:21.220
I think that's every ball accounted for that we know of.

39:21.220 --> 39:25.140
So when you guys were standing on the water and Marvin Glass

39:25.140 --> 39:27.700
pulled up the body of John Wayne Pennymore.

39:27.700 --> 39:28.820
Oh yeah, that's right.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.300
He popped it open like a jar.

39:32.580 --> 39:35.460
I know plot-wise that didn't happen very long ago, but

39:35.460 --> 39:40.100
has enough real-time past that you'll let me listen to those episodes, Zach?

39:41.540 --> 39:41.780
Yeah.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.700
Pump up them numbers, baby.

39:43.700 --> 39:47.460
Slap some ads on there and then you guys can go back and re-listen everything.

39:50.660 --> 39:55.940
Also, I'm wearing a pair of, I'm wearing a pair of MeUndies right now and they're super

39:55.940 --> 39:56.500
comfortable.

39:58.180 --> 40:02.020
My mattress isn't a Casper mattress, but boy, do I wish it was.

40:05.460 --> 40:11.220
Man, I heard if you go to MeUndies.com and type in pretending to wear underwear,

40:11.220 --> 40:12.660
you could get 15% off.

40:12.820 --> 40:13.780
Long coupon.

40:16.580 --> 40:16.980
All right.

40:17.380 --> 40:17.700
Hold on.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.140
I got a bag of chips I need to eat.

40:21.940 --> 40:25.620
Maladori writes, back at the campsite flashback.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.220
Oh, did you guys talk about the homeless people?

40:27.220 --> 40:28.020
No, you skipped one.

40:28.020 --> 40:28.520
Oh, did I?

40:29.140 --> 40:29.540
Oh, shit.

40:29.540 --> 40:29.860
Sorry.

40:29.860 --> 40:30.340
Okay.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.220
Our favorite fan, Crush 36 writes,

40:36.740 --> 40:37.220
JK.

40:37.940 --> 40:38.500
Crush 36.

40:38.500 --> 40:44.100
Oh, it sounds bad no matter what I do.

40:45.700 --> 40:50.100
Crush 36 writes, I'm re-listening on episode four.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.420
What was up with all the homeless people?

40:52.420 --> 40:55.300
I feel like I remember some call back to them later,

40:55.300 --> 40:58.580
but it's not stuck in my head like the other major plot points.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.140
I can take this one.

41:02.340 --> 41:03.300
We found out all about them.

41:03.620 --> 41:11.940
At Glass's facility, we rescued Kathy Piston and she kind of filled us in that she was

41:11.940 --> 41:16.980
trafficking those homeless people to both the Circle of Knowledge and Marvin Glass.

41:17.700 --> 41:18.820
Did you say you rescued her?

41:19.460 --> 41:20.020
Oh, right.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.740
Well, we took her down off the hook and talked to her for a while.

41:25.860 --> 41:28.740
She was our MVP in the fish man fight.

41:28.740 --> 41:32.820
She kept sniping dudes down and then a sickle got her right to the...

41:32.900 --> 41:33.380
That's right.

41:34.260 --> 41:39.060
I went back to listen to that episode so I could make sure that I wasn't divulging stuff

41:39.060 --> 41:40.180
you guys didn't know.

41:40.180 --> 41:45.220
And we did talk about this in the Circle that I told you guys, I know that the Circle of

41:45.220 --> 41:49.620
Knowledge uses homeless people to keep the evil thing that I saw at bay.

41:51.140 --> 41:54.260
And then I asked Kathy, so I know what the Circle of Knowledge is about.

41:54.260 --> 41:55.540
What's Marvin using them for?

41:55.540 --> 42:00.900
And she told us that he uses them for fights and that's all she knows and that she always

42:00.900 --> 42:05.460
got the Circle of Knowledge homeless guys back in good, healthy shape.

42:06.020 --> 42:10.260
Whereas the Marvin Glass guys came back, beat up and spent.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.340
Or not at all, I believe.

42:13.540 --> 42:18.820
Luke was just talking about seeing those videos of the experiments done with ball.

42:19.540 --> 42:20.100
Gotcha.

42:20.100 --> 42:26.660
And I believe it was evident that those were the people being used in those experiments

42:26.660 --> 42:27.300
were the kids.

42:27.860 --> 42:28.820
Orphan, no animals.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.060
Yeah, just orphans.

42:31.060 --> 42:33.460
Like poor ol' Walter.

42:33.460 --> 42:38.740
I played FDR in Annie when I was in 8th grade so I can say all this.

42:39.860 --> 42:42.820
I wore my underwear underneath my polio blanket.

42:42.820 --> 42:43.380
Cool.

42:43.380 --> 42:44.340
Are they me undies?

42:46.020 --> 42:46.900
I've got a plug.

42:46.900 --> 42:47.540
Does Casper...

42:48.660 --> 42:49.940
Any other homeless people?

42:49.940 --> 42:50.660
I believe not.

42:50.660 --> 42:52.340
That was, yeah, very succinct.

42:52.340 --> 42:57.220
I mean, there is a chance that Pastor Adam Kane is doing something with him also.

42:57.220 --> 43:04.660
When we crashed his church, we went down into that cafeteria area.

43:04.660 --> 43:08.580
And I think that you describe that crowd as a homeless-looking crowd.

43:08.580 --> 43:10.180
I always knew there was something off about that guy.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.660
I got the feeling he was like a middleman or something between.

43:12.660 --> 43:13.380
Yeah, maybe.

43:13.380 --> 43:15.060
Or he was in on it with the pistons.

43:15.060 --> 43:15.620
Either way, the food was good.

43:15.620 --> 43:16.420
He's like, I'll feed him.

43:16.420 --> 43:17.540
You transport him.

43:18.180 --> 43:19.460
I'll Jesus him.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.860
You feed him the power of Christ.

43:22.260 --> 43:27.620
Yeah, he could have been saving them all because he knew they were going off to die.

43:27.620 --> 43:29.220
It's like a kind of nice thought.

43:30.420 --> 43:30.740
Yeah.

43:31.460 --> 43:33.940
I mean, he didn't try to stop it from happening.

43:33.940 --> 43:35.940
Yeah, he seemed like that kind of guy.

43:38.420 --> 43:40.660
Okay, express train to heaven.

43:45.060 --> 43:45.780
Holy shit.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.780
I love when you can buy that package at a church.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.160
Yeah.

43:51.140 --> 43:54.340
You're telling me all I have to do is beat up some kids in a cage?

43:56.100 --> 43:56.820
Sign me up.

43:58.660 --> 44:02.740
Like the Ozark mountain daredevil said, if you want to get to heaven, you got to raise a little hell.

44:06.820 --> 44:10.660
To quote the Ozark mountain daredevils, chicken train.

44:11.220 --> 44:11.940
Running all day.

44:14.020 --> 44:15.620
Laser beam in my dream.

44:15.700 --> 44:18.180
I really liked that community episode.

44:18.180 --> 44:22.500
The chicken train one, or you got another episode here from Maladory.

44:24.820 --> 44:27.060
We've got another episode coming up right now.

44:28.660 --> 44:36.740
I hope Q and a special in a row.

44:37.300 --> 44:43.060
No, I, we, Oh, I'm so excited to start playing again, but that is for the end of this.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.500
Maladory on like five or six more Q and A's.

44:50.420 --> 44:52.820
Back at the campsite flashback.

44:52.820 --> 44:58.180
What was with the weird tree arm trap and mirror that threw a spear?

44:58.180 --> 45:02.740
The only acting forces we see are K cell black goo and ball.

45:03.700 --> 45:06.100
None of them really seem like trap people.

45:06.100 --> 45:09.300
That's presumptuous and K cell burns the cabin.

45:09.300 --> 45:10.500
So they weren't using it.

45:11.060 --> 45:13.140
What does that mean?

45:13.140 --> 45:15.620
What do you guys think that means?

45:16.500 --> 45:17.220
It was the witch.

45:18.100 --> 45:20.020
I've got a theory about it all.

45:20.980 --> 45:28.260
So if you remember back to Stan Manstein's monologue, he talked about how Silas Cole

45:28.260 --> 45:30.980
discovered the ooze and then became an inventor.

45:32.180 --> 45:37.220
When I went into the cabin, I found plans for the gun and a bunch of tubes of ooze.

45:37.300 --> 45:40.020
So I wonder if it has something to do with Silas Cole.

45:40.020 --> 45:45.620
Maybe it was his laboratory or something, but the time thing is all crazy.

45:45.620 --> 45:49.460
I don't know how any of that works out, but that's been my theory for a while now that

45:49.460 --> 45:50.500
that has something to do with it.

45:50.500 --> 45:53.460
Can I remind you of something else that you saw in the cabin?

45:54.660 --> 45:58.260
It was paperwork for Cole's orphanage.

45:59.060 --> 46:00.340
Right, right, right, right.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.500
Further strengthening the coal ties.

46:02.500 --> 46:04.100
Further strengthening the coal ties.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.060
Perhaps.

46:05.060 --> 46:07.300
I mean, it was just named after him, so who knows.

46:07.300 --> 46:08.900
Was it named after him or his wife?

46:08.900 --> 46:10.260
What was Mary Cole?

46:10.260 --> 46:11.940
There was something that was named for Mary Cole.

46:11.940 --> 46:13.460
Do we remember what that was?

46:13.460 --> 46:15.060
I believe the library.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.420
Oh, okay, okay, yeah.

46:16.420 --> 46:17.220
That's been my theory.

46:17.220 --> 46:21.460
I don't know anything really about how the traps or mirrors or weird tree and all that

46:21.460 --> 46:25.220
stuff worked or if, I don't know.

46:25.220 --> 46:26.020
I don't know any of it.

46:26.020 --> 46:29.700
That's just been what I've, the two dots that I've connected myself.

46:30.420 --> 46:31.620
What do you guys think the cabin was?

46:31.620 --> 46:33.700
I don't know.

46:34.020 --> 46:37.460
I mean, I didn't get to explore the woods very much.

46:41.540 --> 46:46.100
I forgot you were stuck in a tree for a lot of episodes.

46:46.100 --> 46:47.700
You got to become the woods.

46:47.700 --> 46:49.220
The whole time, I think.

46:49.220 --> 46:54.340
You hung out with some people, though, before you ran away from them.

46:54.340 --> 46:56.420
Oh, yeah, that's right.

46:56.420 --> 47:01.860
I got freed by the agents or whatever, but then I got killed, so I don't know.

47:02.740 --> 47:06.260
Yeah, that was something my character didn't interact with a whole lot.

47:06.260 --> 47:07.700
I don't know much about them.

47:07.700 --> 47:13.780
Because they were scoping out the cabin after they freed me.

47:14.500 --> 47:19.060
I don't really know, though, especially like the, I don't think, I don't think the weird

47:19.060 --> 47:21.300
tree thing was like a trap necessarily.

47:21.300 --> 47:24.100
I think it was more like supernatural.

47:24.100 --> 47:24.900
Gotcha.

47:24.900 --> 47:26.100
And I'm an expert on it.

47:26.980 --> 47:27.540
Studied it.

47:28.740 --> 47:30.740
Any other thoughts on the traps?

47:30.740 --> 47:36.900
Yeah, Thomas, when you went into, when you got on the other side of the moat, you found

47:36.900 --> 47:38.980
a room that I don't think anybody else went into.

47:44.100 --> 47:45.140
What was in that room?

47:49.380 --> 47:54.020
On the inside of the moat with the cabin, there was like a storage.

47:54.020 --> 47:56.100
Oh, was it all the dead orphans?

47:57.060 --> 48:04.820
It was a lot of dead bodies without their spines that were hanging like on racks with

48:05.540 --> 48:07.220
a closet full of their clothes.

48:08.100 --> 48:11.380
That's so spooky, which is why I must have blocked it out.

48:14.180 --> 48:17.620
So yeah, that's like ball.

48:17.620 --> 48:22.740
I will say when I went back and listened to those, I was super incredibly frustrated that

48:22.740 --> 48:27.700
when I went into that room with the plans for the gun, you were like, there's these

48:27.700 --> 48:32.100
ooze like coffin things and there's these paperwork and there's these diagrams.

48:32.100 --> 48:36.500
And I investigated all of those, but you also said there's a chest in the corner.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.260
And there's a wooden trunk.

48:38.260 --> 48:40.020
Never, it never got brought up again.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.940
I totally forgot to check into it.

48:41.940 --> 48:43.940
There could have been something cool inside.

48:44.580 --> 48:48.820
I wonder, I think that that was why I decided not to check it out is because I thought I

48:48.820 --> 48:53.300
knew what it was, but to have not actually said, let's open that bad boy up.

48:55.460 --> 48:56.260
It might've.

48:56.260 --> 48:58.500
It was real frustrating to listen back to.

48:58.500 --> 49:02.340
I think that's probably something that the listeners can relate to.

49:05.300 --> 49:05.800
All right.

49:07.380 --> 49:10.180
Justin, you have any theories about the woods?

49:10.180 --> 49:13.620
Oh, they seem bad and like you shouldn't be there.

49:13.620 --> 49:14.120
Nope.

49:15.780 --> 49:23.140
And you shouldn't be putting your arm inside of a weird monster tree that desires flesh.

49:23.140 --> 49:26.180
I was so glad that you did it like right away.

49:26.180 --> 49:27.860
You just did it so quick.

49:27.860 --> 49:28.900
I mean, it's funny.

49:28.900 --> 49:32.500
It's funny looking back, but it was like you said a loop trap.

49:34.820 --> 49:37.540
Almost as if what does this button do?

49:37.540 --> 49:38.340
Oh boy.

49:38.340 --> 49:40.740
Whatever happened to our naked raccoon friend?

49:41.380 --> 49:42.020
Oh, right.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.380
He's he's did he get killed at the end?

49:45.380 --> 49:47.060
Did I, did I see him get killed?

49:47.060 --> 49:48.980
How long do raccoons live for?

49:50.500 --> 49:51.460
Uh, I'll Google it.

49:55.780 --> 49:56.980
I'm going to say four years.

49:58.980 --> 50:04.260
Two to three years, 28 inches, two to three years in the wild.

50:07.140 --> 50:09.220
And 10 to 15 years old as a pet.

50:09.220 --> 50:09.940
Oh wow.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.780
We should be getting more raccoons as pets.

50:12.420 --> 50:14.100
What if there's a human inside?

50:15.460 --> 50:16.580
Uh, split the diff.

50:18.980 --> 50:20.180
That's what Google says.

50:20.900 --> 50:22.260
Human inside, not outside.

50:23.060 --> 50:24.020
Human inside.

50:24.020 --> 50:24.520
Yeah.

50:25.060 --> 50:28.100
I accidentally Googled how long do raccoons.

50:29.140 --> 50:31.140
How long do raccoons Zach?

50:32.020 --> 50:37.460
So they, uh, Jay Hawk Inc asked any of the side story characters that could show up in

50:37.460 --> 50:43.300
the main story or the inverse, like the boys getting to explore the calm, comfy campgrounds.

50:44.100 --> 50:50.020
Uh, yeah, I, um, I made plans a while ago for the calm, comfy campgrounds in case you

50:50.020 --> 50:54.820
guys wanted to go there as far as side stories showing up in the main story.

50:54.820 --> 50:56.820
Um, it's all main story, baby.

50:57.380 --> 51:01.140
I know like some of them are in the past, but this is all one big story.

51:01.140 --> 51:02.900
That's all interconnected.

51:02.900 --> 51:05.380
So it's all main story.

51:05.460 --> 51:10.340
So they could all show up anywhere if they're still alive or if they're not, maybe, uh,

51:10.340 --> 51:15.940
Jay Hawk Inc also says, I think I'm going to make one of my social distancing projects,

51:15.940 --> 51:18.260
quote, re-listen and fill out the Wiki.

51:19.140 --> 51:21.540
Hell yeah, but do it.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.300
Good luck indeed.

51:23.300 --> 51:24.900
But yeah, that would be sick.

51:24.900 --> 51:31.540
Uh, I'll send you the overviews of the episodes if you want help with doing that.

51:32.260 --> 51:36.660
And then, uh, they also said, and maybe pay more attention to the community.

51:36.660 --> 51:41.300
I don't follow on Twitter for some reason, do it that pretending prod on Twitter and

51:41.300 --> 51:45.140
didn't even know we had a discord until it was mentioned in the last episode.

51:45.140 --> 51:46.020
How dare you?

51:46.020 --> 51:48.180
How did I not know we had a discord?

51:48.180 --> 51:49.780
How did you not know we had a discord?

51:49.780 --> 51:50.980
We never talk about it.

51:52.900 --> 51:57.220
I mean, we kind of mentioned it offhandedly, but I don't think we've, have we ever like

51:57.220 --> 51:58.980
explicitly shouted it out on the show?

51:59.860 --> 52:00.740
I don't know.

52:02.500 --> 52:06.260
I think Wolf the dog does it fairly often.

52:06.260 --> 52:08.820
And it's definitely not in any of the early episodes.

52:08.820 --> 52:09.380
That is true.

52:09.380 --> 52:12.500
But I'm afraid at this point because the discord is awesome.

52:13.220 --> 52:17.860
And the more people join, the more likely for it to be not awesome anymore.

52:17.860 --> 52:18.900
Oh, it's, it's easy.

52:18.900 --> 52:21.380
You just ban them when they're dumb immediately.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.420
Shout out to crush 36.

52:24.420 --> 52:26.500
Shout out to pretending to be Justin.

52:29.780 --> 52:30.660
Mod it up boys.

52:31.860 --> 52:32.980
We got another question.

52:32.980 --> 52:34.260
This one's a fun one.

52:34.260 --> 52:35.780
Guys, lighten up.

52:35.780 --> 52:37.540
You're taking this way too seriously.

52:38.580 --> 52:39.940
This is a fun one.

52:39.940 --> 52:46.180
Crane song asks, let's suppose the boys parentheses, including Drew and Maggie and whoever

52:46.180 --> 52:52.420
Zach decides is covered by quote, the boys were put under quarantine like we are today.

52:52.420 --> 52:57.140
Assuming that for some reason, contention PD is not considered an essential service,

52:58.100 --> 52:58.740
which I love.

52:59.860 --> 53:04.100
How do you, how do they, how do they spend their isolation or would they ignore?

53:04.740 --> 53:06.660
Oh, don't give that option to them.

53:06.660 --> 53:09.860
Would they ignore a statewide stay at home order?

53:10.900 --> 53:11.380
That's unfortunate.

53:11.380 --> 53:12.580
We know the answer.

53:12.580 --> 53:12.820
Yeah.

53:12.820 --> 53:15.140
But unfortunately, you know, John Lee Pennymore would.

53:15.140 --> 53:19.300
I know the first thing that would come out of your mouth is that John Lee Pennymore wouldn't

53:19.300 --> 53:20.580
give a fuck.

53:20.580 --> 53:22.660
Well, he would like, Oh my God.

53:22.660 --> 53:23.540
Such an idiot.

53:23.540 --> 53:24.100
I know.

53:24.180 --> 53:29.460
And there's this dude I know on Facebook, the shit he's posted about COVID is like,

53:29.460 --> 53:33.380
definitely what the kind of media like John Lee Pennymore would consume.

53:33.380 --> 53:39.300
Oh, like baseless theories about how it's like trying to control us as a population.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.780
Like, yeah, like 5g conspiracy theory shit.

53:41.780 --> 53:42.740
Oh yeah.

53:42.740 --> 53:43.860
So just like true stuff.

53:45.220 --> 53:48.500
Yeah, the straight shit.

53:50.260 --> 53:51.940
Honestly, he might take it seriously.

53:52.100 --> 53:57.540
Uh, he might be that kind of like prepper conspiracy theorist who's like, kind of been

53:57.540 --> 54:00.820
waiting for this, but he also just has like a lot of land.

54:00.820 --> 54:06.580
So he's probably out there just like shooting guns all day and riding around on like a four

54:06.580 --> 54:09.860
Wheeler and watching his DVDs.

54:09.860 --> 54:14.900
Any existential crisis inside John Lee Pennymore about enjoying the quarantine?

54:15.620 --> 54:18.900
No, I don't think John Lee Pennymore ever sweats having a good time.

54:19.780 --> 54:21.780
Why are you going to feel guilty about living your life, baby?

54:24.980 --> 54:26.820
Not much would change for Clark.

54:26.820 --> 54:29.780
He just wouldn't be going to work, but he'd still be at home.

54:29.780 --> 54:35.540
Uh, maybe he'd break out his old jigsaw puzzles and, uh, he might, uh, he might teach

54:35.540 --> 54:38.340
himself how to cook, not a TV dinner.

54:39.220 --> 54:41.700
He might learn to boil an egg.

54:43.700 --> 54:45.300
I have 40 boiled eggs.

54:45.860 --> 54:48.500
He gets a chef's hat with one notch in it.

54:51.780 --> 54:52.740
What about Keith Vigna?

54:53.540 --> 55:00.180
Uh, Keith gets a side job delivering newspapers in his cruiser and then continues to cruise

55:00.180 --> 55:05.540
around the city the whole day, basically ignoring that he's not essential and just to have some

55:05.540 --> 55:06.660
sort of authority.

55:08.100 --> 55:10.100
That's worse than John's.

55:10.580 --> 55:12.900
Oh, that's worse than John's.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.300
Yeah, except for the Facebook share.

55:18.740 --> 55:23.300
Like I harass people in the parking lot of the grocery store.

55:24.900 --> 55:28.900
You're just hanging out at the first church of contention every Sunday and Wednesday,

55:28.900 --> 55:30.100
handing out tickets.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.540
Yeah, exactly.

55:31.540 --> 55:36.420
I think Wolf the dog would seize as much power as he possibly could since he knows everyone's

55:36.420 --> 55:38.580
stuck at home listening to him constantly.

55:39.300 --> 55:40.180
It's like Mitch McConnell.

55:40.900 --> 55:46.740
You could also just like maybe fuck off to like another time until things get like, I'm

55:46.740 --> 55:48.420
going to where the garbage is.

55:51.940 --> 55:53.700
People have been very conscious of their garbage.

55:53.700 --> 55:54.580
What would Drew be doing?

55:54.580 --> 55:57.460
Would he be working on his, uh, his YouTube channel?

55:58.980 --> 56:03.140
I think Drew would honestly, uh, get really upset.

56:03.140 --> 56:04.340
He lives alone.

56:04.340 --> 56:07.940
So he would get really, really lonely.

56:07.940 --> 56:15.540
And every day that went by without a zoom call, uh, or even the request for, uh, any

56:15.540 --> 56:21.380
sort of friendship would lead him to slowly stop enjoying the things that he previously

56:21.380 --> 56:23.460
liked, like playing Minecraft.

56:24.820 --> 56:28.340
For his millions of YouTube subscribers.

56:28.340 --> 56:32.580
Shit does that, I just remembered that Drew and John are millionaires.

56:35.380 --> 56:38.180
John would be much more of a problem.

56:38.180 --> 56:45.380
He would have been down at his ass off and like Pensacola.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.580
Just being a problem.

56:52.100 --> 56:57.700
And Drew, I would assume is like maybe having a good time ordering himself everything he

56:57.700 --> 56:58.820
ever wanted from Amazon.

56:59.460 --> 57:07.620
I think, uh, he is just waiting that extra week and trying to avoid articles about any

57:07.620 --> 57:13.860
sort of worker strikes, uh, in order to feel fine about ordering from Amazon.

57:13.860 --> 57:24.580
And meanwhile, he's just got like maps of different cities up on his wall and stats,

57:24.660 --> 57:31.140
uh, for how many potential youths lives can be changed with the money that he's bringing

57:31.140 --> 57:36.020
in for each city, uh, trying to decide where he can do the most good.

57:36.020 --> 57:36.740
Wow.

57:36.740 --> 57:37.860
And a boy.

57:37.860 --> 57:38.580
Good job, Drew.

57:40.580 --> 57:42.100
He only has $5 million.

57:44.820 --> 57:52.020
He's got a $10,000 Mike, uh, Minecraft computer and all the cool ASMR stuff you could imagine.

57:52.740 --> 57:54.420
So much bubble wrap.

57:58.660 --> 58:00.020
All the bubble wrap.

58:00.020 --> 58:03.540
The only music Drew listens to is ASMR Youtubers.

58:04.820 --> 58:05.620
And bubble wrap.

58:06.340 --> 58:07.060
Bubble wrap.

58:08.900 --> 58:12.100
Oh, you guys, this is a really good bubble wrap compilation.

58:12.100 --> 58:15.620
Bubble wrap would be a great name for like a kid's hip hop album.

58:15.620 --> 58:16.820
Oh yeah.

58:16.820 --> 58:21.380
It works at least in three ways that I can think of.

58:21.380 --> 58:24.580
Bubble wrap sounds like a Kiro Kiro Benito album.

58:24.580 --> 58:26.340
Oh, Oh, Thomas.

58:26.340 --> 58:27.460
We got a speed round.

58:27.460 --> 58:36.020
We got to hit when Thomas gets back speed round round.

58:36.020 --> 58:40.180
They're all about me and the things that I am going to say.

58:40.180 --> 58:45.460
So I want you guys to ask me these questions as fast as you can.

58:46.340 --> 58:50.900
And don't decide who goes first or who goes next, but please go as fast as you can.

58:51.140 --> 58:56.420
BazingaBegins asks, who are the four skeleton boys on the PTP logo supposed to be?

58:56.420 --> 58:58.420
Do they have one-to-one analogs in the story?

58:58.420 --> 59:00.100
Which came first, the story or the logo?

59:00.100 --> 59:05.220
It is Luke, a cowboy, an FBI MIB type agent.

59:05.220 --> 59:06.660
And, oh, fuck.

59:06.660 --> 59:07.460
What's the last one?

59:07.460 --> 59:08.180
I'm blanking.

59:08.180 --> 59:09.620
I'm blanking so hard.

59:09.620 --> 59:10.180
A cop.

59:10.180 --> 59:12.260
It's a cop with a mustache.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.580
A one-to-one analogs in the story.

59:14.580 --> 59:15.080
No.

59:15.860 --> 59:17.460
Which came first, the story or the logo?

59:17.460 --> 59:18.180
The story.

59:18.180 --> 59:23.540
But the logo, while not one-to-one analogs is definitely, I chose them for a reason based

59:23.540 --> 59:24.740
on the whole story that we're telling.

59:24.740 --> 59:25.540
So get ready.

59:25.540 --> 59:26.660
Jayhawk Inc.

59:26.660 --> 59:28.820
Just how big is contention?

59:28.820 --> 59:32.580
Like there was a school bus full of homeless people, but I'm not sure where they all came

59:32.580 --> 59:32.980
from.

59:32.980 --> 59:35.300
How many people work at Contingent PD?

59:35.300 --> 59:38.740
5,000 people live in contention or slightly fewer.

59:38.740 --> 59:43.140
And four people, five people work at Contingent PD.

59:43.140 --> 59:44.180
No, six.

59:44.180 --> 59:49.460
The three of you, Drew, Maggie, and Ray, Ari, Tim, Florence.

59:50.180 --> 59:56.340
BxBori9181 asks, I feel like clothes in certain situations are very important.

59:56.340 --> 59:58.260
Am I imagining that or is it so?

59:58.260 --> 59:59.460
It is very important.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:04.100
It's an audio medium where I have to describe people and then you have to remember them

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.660
for later.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.500
So I have to keep the same descriptions of either what they're wearing or what they look

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.500
like every time they pop back up or most of the time when they pop back up, depending

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.260
on how subtle I'm trying to be.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:14.980
Nice.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:20.500
BazingaBegins asks, after season one wraps, will Zach be posting full lore notes slash

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.300
background?

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:24.420
Any chance of turning this into an official module for Delta Green?

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.820
Turning this into an official module for Delta Green would take as much time as writing a

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.940
book and I'm willing to put it in if we can make it happen.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:37.380
But our Patreon would have to be at a higher level and we'd also have to get Delta Green

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.660
behind us to publish it.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.900
But if they don't want to publish it and the money's there, I will definitely spend the

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.780
time to write this thing out into a full book and get illustrators and do maps for every

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:51.380
building and everything and it would be fucking awesome and I would love to do that.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.980
Jayhawk Inc.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:58.980
How many clues did the group miss or misinterpret before the ding was edited in after correct

01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.620
guesses?

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:04.260
Clues have been missed and misinterpreted constantly from the beginning and that's how

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.780
role-playing works constantly and that's what makes it so much fun.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.500
The ding was only in like one or two episodes and it was for fun.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.500
LordDary asks, have you guys ever thought about a collaboration with Last Podcast on

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.060
the left?

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.580
I dream about it every night.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.420
I love Last Podcast on the left.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:23.540
Everyone should tweet at Last Podcast on the left and be like, hey, you guys don't have

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.340
a role-playing podcast on the Last Podcast network.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.380
Maybe you should have one.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.620
And then mention us.

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.820
Don't forget about that part.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.820
Yeah, that would be, yes, thank you, Luke, please.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:33.460
Next.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:37.620
Bazinga Begin says, how long did you think it would take the boys to play through the

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.740
campaign, i.e.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.540
how many episodes did you think season one would be?

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.140
What's the most important detail that got added after your initial plans?

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.700
40 episodes tops, whole thing.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.020
I was like, easy, done, for sure.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.260
What's the most, and it'll probably be 100 is my guess currently.

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.620
What's the most important detail that got added after, all of them, all of them got

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.540
it added after the initial plans.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:04.420
What I planned was just background and the first like two episodes.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:09.860
Jayhawk Inc, is there a list of loose threads or abandoned or unresolved elements?

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.180
Yes.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.980
OkayNothing4 asks, what happened to the gun, helmet, radio, etc?

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.900
They just vanished from the story?

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.180
They vanished from the story because the players aren't where they are.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:28.900
The radio and the helmet are in the contention evidence locker and the gun and the camera

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.220
are in Marvin Glass's compound.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:36.020
Jayhawk Inc asks, has anything been forgotten by accident that might have changed the story

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.940
if it had been remembered at the time?

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.980
Yes, 100%, absolutely, constantly.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.980
I think that's the story of the podcast.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.660
If you remember something, it becomes more important.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.740
Thomas, read that last one.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:52.660
Hold on.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.820
It's a speed round, come on.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.940
Bazinga begins.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.460
On page what counts as a story?

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.060
Speed round.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.700
Sorry, when you said last one, I went to the last one.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.820
We got to keep saying speed round.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.540
Speed round.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.500
All right, Bazinga begins.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.740
What counts as a story arc on the show?

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.380
The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more story arcs left.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:19.220
How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.220
You read that so well and I really appreciated you doing that.

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.660
Like your cadence was perfect and your voice-

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:27.620
Speed round.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.580
Can you read it as fast as you can?

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.380
I'm just curious.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.260
I think it'd be fun.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.140
Bazinga begins.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.420
What counts as a story arc on the show?

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.660
The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more story arcs left.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.740
How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.860
That was amazing.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.300
That was so impressive.

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:46.340
Should we all, at the same time, all at the same time as fast as we can?

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.140
Three.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:47.700
Count us down.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.540
Three, two, one.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.380
What counts as a story arc on the show?

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:54.340
The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more arcs left.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.140
How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly?

01:03:58.820 --> 01:03:59.540
Nice.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.660
I fumbled a few words.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.420
It was kind of weird hearing it all at the same time.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.020
It was like a speech jammer.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:07.780
Everyone answered at the same time.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.740
No, so there have been seven arcs so far.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:11.540
There are three left.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.580
That'll be 10 total.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.140
Episodes one through 14 was the start to the FBI agents leaving contention.

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.860
Episodes 15 to 25 is the next arc.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.180
Flashbacks of their past to the officers leaving contention.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:31.380
Episodes 26 through 35 is them going to the city to chanting inside Ari Manstein's mausoleum,

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.260
which is where we've, you know, the end of where we've reset to.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.100
And then 37 to 46 was the glass compound in Planet Juggernaut.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.660
47 to 53 was the woods in the past.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.180
54 to 64 was the numbers in City State University.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.900
And 66 to 72 is calm comfy campground, also in the past.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.620
That is the end of that.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.100
Yes.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:56.340
And then bonus arc is eight Q&A episodes.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.460
Yeah, and we have Maladory asks, what is your favorite type of plot?

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.620
I am personally a big fan of scatter, but I can't fault anyone who enjoys a good box plot.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.980
I'm a graph kind of guy.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.100
I like a probability plot.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.460
I like a good one.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:10.500
I like pie.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.820
I like when the plot thickens.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.260
Damn Guardian asks, are we going to see Drew again?

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.860
Everyone answer on the count of three.

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.580
One, two, three.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.460
Absolutely.

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:20.820
Hell yeah.

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:22.020
Yeah, no doubt for sure.

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.500
That is the end of the speed round.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.740
I didn't know that's where that speed round ended.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.540
I think we nailed it so fast.

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.420
I can't wait to listen to us all ask the question at the same time.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.860
It's my favorite part of the episode.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.940
Uh, so we've got a question here from Maladory asks with contention being abandoned or emptied

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.180
recently and the town having turned against the CPD because of the non-denomination specific

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.500
pastor, is anyone there left around or is it mostly just the people in the city?

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.620
Did anyone actually make it out or was everyone gobbled up by the old goo monster?

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:58.740
Curious as to what your guys's thoughts are on the matter.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:04.020
Is he actually non-denominational or is he, uh, like Pentecostal or a Baptist?

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.740
He is non-denominational, but not the denomination of non-denom.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.220
Just he doesn't have a denomination.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.180
First church of contention, pastor Adam Kane.

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:18.100
I think that we can answer that when we go back.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.260
Yeah, that's, that's what I wrote in my little notes here is that we don't know for sure.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.460
I think Drew has told us that it seems dead around the city or around contention.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:33.940
I have a feeling that we will arrive, uh, to a nightmare scenario, but that's just my guess.

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.980
Or everything's fine, probably.

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.660
Everything's just completely back to normal.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.260
Which would be almost even scarier.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.220
If we've done our jobs right.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:48.020
In the last numbers arc, the city university arc, did we, we tried to call Drew a few times,

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.100
didn't we? And it just kept going to voicemail?

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:50.580
Yeah.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:51.060
Okay.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:54.660
So go, going back to that last question, probably not then.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.740
Okay, nothing for, how have the decisions made affected the trust held between the

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:05.220
three contention PD officers?

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.820
How did it affect you when you found out that I killed my brother?

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:09.780
It wasn't great.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.740
I, uh, I feel like Clark still has a level of trust for you guys though.

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:21.060
Just because we've gone, we started at zero and we've gone through so much crazy shit together

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:25.860
that like, I'm a little more understanding about you doing fucked up shit in this world now.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.260
I think possibly it has raised the trust level.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.860
Probably for Keith it has.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:37.700
Yeah, definitely like I've seen Keith handle himself in these situations now.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:42.500
And so I don't think it, I don't think he was surprised to learn about Keith killing his brother.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:46.180
That tracks, that tracks.

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:46.340
Yeah.

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:51.540
But I think I definitely find Keith more capable than I might've at the start of the series.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.540
I think Keith has gotten more capable as time goes.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:01.060
It's been hours since I've been a truly pathetic police officer.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.940
Crane song asks players.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:11.220
Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from you?

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.020
Any theories about the other characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share?

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:19.620
So don't answer that one right now.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:21.060
I don't know.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:21.540
Can you hear me?

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.020
Don't do it.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:22.900
Yeah.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.420
Pretend you can't answer it.

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:32.020
Uh, so I'm going to break you guys off as soon as this quarantine's over.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.740
I'm just going to break you guys.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.380
Bring it, bitch.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.060
Break a piece off of you, Joe.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:41.140
Hey, okay.

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.900
I'd like to see you try.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.260
Break me off a piece of that Joe Terry.

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.580
Come on, get a snack.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:58.340
So, uh, so yeah, be thinking about, uh, whether or not you have any theories on the other

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:01.620
characters while, uh, who's going to pee first.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.660
I have to pee.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.900
Want to see all the bubblies I've drank so far?

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.540
One, two.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:09.380
Oh my God.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.420
No way.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:10.660
Three.

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:13.220
No, you're not going to pull.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:13.620
Four.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:13.940
Four?

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:15.780
You're out of control.

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:19.220
And then two, two in the trashcan that I've thrown away.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.900
And this is the one I'm drinking right now.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:23.220
That's an expensive habit you're picking up there.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.900
Well, I'm in my parents' house, so they're buying it.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.900
Those are the three Coke Zero I drank.

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.300
Oh, wowzers.

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:34.740
I had two cold brews and I am sweaty.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:38.420
I had a small water bottle and now I'm working on a big water bottle.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.180
Fuck off.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.060
Shut the fuck up, Joe.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.420
Oh, I added, uh, I added Emergen-C to the small water bottle.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:46.900
Oh, nice.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.820
I've been drinking a lot of that too.

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:53.220
I haven't drank alcohol this whole quarantine, so I've been replacing it with bubbly and

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.180
Pocky sticks.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.300
Nice combo, man.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.860
Yeah, it makes me have to pee and poop all the time though.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.340
So, bye.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.860
All right, I'm going to sing.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.220
Should I take my headphones off?

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.540
Cause I can hear what you guys say in the bathroom.

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.860
You shouldn't have told us that and you should have just popped up like a cool bathroom guest.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.060
All right.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:22.180
I am going to send Thomas off to the waiting room and I'll bring you back in shortly.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:22.820
Bye.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.060
Bye.

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:25.140
Oh, that's fun.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:25.460
Hi.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.740
Oh, zoom is so much easier than having the, like you guys in the living room, like screaming

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.140
at each other because we're all the loudest people ever.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:37.220
I hope that they remember to keep their recordings going and that you get to hear what we talk

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.700
about when we're in the living room.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:41.860
Oh yeah.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:42.820
I didn't think about that.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.780
Wait, can you guys see each other when you're in the waiting room?

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.500
They can't hear you, nor can I tell you the answer to that.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.820
Do you want to put me in the waiting room and then bring me back?

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.900
He's gone.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.380
Oh no.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:56.900
All right.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.780
Let's bring him back.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:00.980
We sent a scout into the portal.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:01.700
Oh God.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.340
No, it was just a blank screen.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.340
There's nothing on the other side.

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:06.980
Oh God.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.580
That's almost worse than what I was expecting.

01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.420
I've seen the waiting room.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.220
Somebody Thomas changed his name to mommy.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:20.100
Hey, that's fun.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.540
I like that.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.140
Okay.

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:23.780
What's up, Joe?

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.060
You're the only one who's here.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.660
I've got a question for you.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.300
Justin is also here.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.740
Got a question for you.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.940
It's Hey, who is Angela Fairfield?

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:41.380
So it turned out I believe it was Annie or Ann.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.060
It was, uh, the woman that killed Clark's parents.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.740
And I kind of wish I would have, it would have dawned on me at the time in

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.380
role-playing, but the little girl who I think we're assuming is Maggie now came

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.780
running up the sidewalk and was like, and, and good to see you.

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:04.660
And I think I failed a human role to see how Ann reacted to that and how James

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:05.380
reacted.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:05.620
Yeah.

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:10.660
But yeah, it, after the fact, I, it kind of, it, uh, it all, it all came around

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.460
full circle too.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:16.980
Oh, I remember you realizing after we'd stopped recording and you were like,

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.620
what?

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.580
Zach, you motherfucker!

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.700
Like you like really, and I, I never...

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:28.500
To have made Joe married to the character that killed his other character's

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.660
parents was a really weird mind fuck.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:32.740
Yeah.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:35.700
Thank you.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.980
Yeah, you nailed it.

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.020
Also renamed the parents.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.740
Yeah, Jerry and Eunice.

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:44.740
Love that.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:51.540
I wrote down in my notes here that I wanted to remind the audience that Clark

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:57.860
actually saw Ann in the circle of knowledge room when he very first was

01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:58.420
brought there.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:02.740
He saw a glimpse of her as a door shut closed.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:06.740
So another reason I should have picked up on the fact that she was running in

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.420
the circle of knowledge crew.

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:14.420
Probably you would have expected her to still be in jail, likely, based on you

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.940
being at her hearing and her pulling a double homicide.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.180
And admitting to it on the stand.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.940
She said, I did it and I do it again.

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.740
One might've assumed that she would not be free to go wherever she pleased.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:33.860
But there's also a timey-wimey fucky thing going on with Clark's memories too.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.660
So, I mean, there's a little bit of like, did that happen?

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.460
Did that not happen?

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.420
Did that not happen?

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:38.580
Yeah.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.420
It's real, it's real, real wild for him.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:45.860
I think if we're this deep in the game and you're not questioning reality, then

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.540
you're not paying attention.

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:53.940
Bazinga begins asked, so Clark and Maggie, is Clark in love with her or what?

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:59.300
Maybe in like an Oedipal way, but I think it's way more of an authority

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:03.540
figure that he respects and wants the approval of.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.460
I think he's got hots for teacher.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:06.740
Yeah, there you go.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:12.660
Maybe that, but it's, it's not surface level romance for sure.

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.380
Maladory asks, are we going to see more about Clark's parents?

01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:21.620
What info can you give us that we know about them, but might not have stuck in?

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.820
All the best letters got me emotionally.

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:27.460
And I hope Clark finds some closure there.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:32.580
So early on, we mentioned that we gave Zach the free reign to do whatever he wants to

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.420
our characters' backstories.

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.420
And he's done exactly that with the parent stuff.

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.780
That was never written into my character description.

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.980
So I'm learning and absorbing as much as the audience is when all that stuff comes up.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.060
So as far as stuff that stuck out to us that we, or maybe that hasn't stuck out to

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.020
us that needed to have stuck out to us, I hope I didn't miss any of that.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.900
But I'm loving it.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.300
I think it's, you were already given the best letters is a really fucking ominous

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.620
and cool hook that I'm, I really want to explore so much more.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.260
Yeah, I feel like it's, but yeah, I'm right there with you.

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:10.900
I feel like it's adding a really interesting wrinkle to Clark's weird character.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.100
Totally.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.700
I'm loving playing it too.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:14.260
Yeah.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:18.500
When we found old Clark's hidey hole and we found that tape of his parents playing on

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.620
Wheel of Fortune, that was a really cool just moment.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.060
Like what the fuck's going on?

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:23.560
Yeah.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.060
I have a question.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.620
Why do you, other than, nevermind.

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.420
So let's see.

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:35.860
Clark's parents were seen in the flashback, obviously.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.500
We've got the picture as well.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.020
Oh yeah, fuck.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:42.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:43.620
Jim Cook's house.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.940
Jim Cook was friends with my parents.

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:46.900
I forgot about that.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.380
It's just a picture of them with Jim, right?

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:49.620
Yep.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.380
And they're all like smiley.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.020
I think your parents were smiling and Jim Cook was like.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.460
Yeah, he was stern.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.260
Audio medium.

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.260
He was stoic.

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:00.660
It's weird.

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:05.620
I have more trouble with that now that we're on Zoom than I ever did when we were literally

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:06.260
face to face.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:09.060
I don't know.

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:15.060
And then we've got them being at the circle of, yeah, sure.

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:18.740
At the circle of knowledge's calm, comfy campground, right?

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:26.340
So curious as to like metagaming, what your thoughts were when you found out that your

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.700
parents had been to comfy campground.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.740
You were freaking me out that you were trying to imply that Anne was my mom.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.940
Now I remember that we saw the names on the tapes.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.700
Eunice would never.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:38.980
I was like, what the fuck?

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:44.820
Yeah, no, seeing Eunice and Jerry, I mean, so yeah, it's metagame wise, it's all coming

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.700
together that they had something to do with the circle of knowledge.

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:52.180
They were, or actually maybe not the circle of knowledge, the tapes were people who had

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.780
participated on the island.

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.220
So maybe the circle of knowledge needed something from them.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.260
Yeah, that's what it is.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:01.300
They needed something from Clark's parents.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.260
Holy shit.

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.260
I didn't put that together until just now.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.940
That's super fucking dope.

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:10.100
It's, I have a few theories already now what they might've got.

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.460
Oh, that made me really happy watching your face change.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.460
That's dope.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:16.740
That was cool.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:19.380
Yeah.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:20.580
All right, let's move on.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.620
Bazinga begins asks, what happened to Clark's heart?

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.380
It got poked out.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:27.700
Next.

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.540
Very succinct.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:32.740
Okay.

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.740
I think maybe what they were actually going for is where did we leave it?

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.060
And I don't remember exactly.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:45.860
I was showing Maggie and she pulled the rod out in front of me and like reassure me that

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:46.580
I would be okay.

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.980
And I think we just went to the next scene.

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:49.940
I think I left it there.

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:51.780
Yeah.

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.820
Clark didn't take it with him.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.900
So it is at them.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:59.140
Is it in like a little cooler assume and it says Clark's bag of ice.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.620
I'm hoping that they don't touch Clark's.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.100
I popped it into the freezer.

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:05.940
Okay.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:10.820
Nothing for asked how many versions of Clark Bishop have there been so far?

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:11.540
Oh, I'm curious.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:12.420
Did you look this up?

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.020
I did it from memory.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.140
But I don't know the, I don't know totally.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:17.380
Okay.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.940
So I'll tell you the instances that we've seen other Clarks, uh, one ran into the police

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.500
department and told Drew not to go to Maggie's house.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:29.220
There was one that was running across a field while I was standing in my kitchen.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.420
And it was right when the circle of knowledge first abducted me.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:36.500
Like I saw him running toward me and realized it was, it was a Clark.

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:40.100
And then I blacked out and woke up in the circle of knowledge.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:43.220
And then we've just got the old Clark's fuckery.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:45.460
He's in a robe and doing symbols and shit.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:51.220
I don't know how to categorize that if that's like a bunch of different Clark bishops, or

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:56.500
if it's the same Clark bishops at different points in his life, coming back to touch my

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.540
Clark's life.

01:18:58.180 --> 01:18:59.460
I don't know how to differentiate.

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:05.220
So I, yeah, so that's the, those are the instances of different Clarks, unless I'm forgetting

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:05.460
one.

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.380
Do you remember if there was another Zach?

01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.100
No idea, man.

01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:14.180
Uh, that'll do it for the, wait, I want to answer the, uh, lead in.

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.220
Oh yeah.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.700
Crane song asked players.

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:21.460
Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.220
you or any theories about other characters you're not sure of, but you're willing to

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:25.620
share?

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:31.460
So the only thing that I think is maybe being, maybe purposefully kept from me, but I don't

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:36.340
know if it's that, or if it's just Thomas not remembering, but I feel like he saw files

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.660
that had a lot to do with all of us.

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:44.420
And he told me like he saw an in one of the files and love.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:49.780
I just don't know if he was being cagey with me because he, there was more in the file

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:54.020
that he didn't want to share with me or if he was just not remembering it all.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.700
I feel like that is an interesting thing that Clark would like to know more about all the

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.980
files that Thomas saw.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:03.940
And then also everything that happened to John Lee Pettymore is a little bit fuzzy as

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:05.380
far as truth or not truth.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:10.500
But I, again, I don't know for sure if it's purposeful or not, but yeah, I think that's

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:10.980
fair.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:15.300
And those are the big ones that I'm, I'm curious about anything, theories about other

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.380
characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share.

01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:20.740
Clark is really fucking conflicted about Maggie.

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:27.140
I feel like he, there's a lot of signs pointing to her being shady, but she showed him the

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:29.380
fucking scary thing that scared the wits out of him.

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:32.260
So he just knows that he needs to make that not a thing.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:38.580
But like we found that note that was maybe her dad saying that Maggie, like he had underlined

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:43.060
and over-lined words to like maybe cast aspersions on Maggie.

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:46.580
And you found that in the secret room at Jim Cook's house.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:51.140
That that we're, we're rolling with the theory that it was maybe where old Clark was living.

01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.900
So I just, yeah, I don't know.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.180
Clark is super conflicted.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:57.540
Joe is super conflicted about where to stand with Maggie.

01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:57.780
Yeah.

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:01.620
Again, he's, she's somebody that he would trust implicitly though.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:05.380
So he's, he's going to go along with it until something smacks him over the head.

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:05.780
I think.

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.700
Yeah.

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.740
Thank you, Joe.

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:09.240
Thank you.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.660
I love having you as a player.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.260
I love playing with you.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:14.980
You're my favorite.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:19.540
I'm going to, I'm going to go, I'm going to go tell them.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.220
And let's get Joe the fuck out of here.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:22.740
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:28.020
I'm glad you lied to him about being your favorite.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:28.900
He, he needed it.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.340
He, I mean, he has to have it.

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:36.180
He just like, Oh man.

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.460
Obviously, obviously player.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:40.980
Let's see.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.060
I'm pulling Thomas up right now.

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:43.940
Let's see if he's here.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:44.500
There he is.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:49.480
Hi.

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.220
I got one question for you, baby.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:53.940
Yeah.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.380
Where the money at?

01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:55.860
Oh man.

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.500
I wish I knew.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.060
Not in podcasting.

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:02.020
Yeah.

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.460
If anybody finds out, let me know.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:09.940
Do you know where the money that you made from the drug deal as John Lee

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:12.980
Pettymore is currently?

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:13.460
Yeah.

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:16.580
John, John knows he's not going to tell anyone.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.500
I'm cool with that actually.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:18.900
Yeah.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.380
Oh, I mean, you're going to bullshit your way out of it.

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:27.620
That works for me because I looked it up and we never talked about where you hid

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:29.700
the money before you passed out drunk.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:33.860
So I would assume that you hid the money somewhere.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:34.580
That's the answer.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.860
John doesn't quite know.

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.100
It's perfect.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:44.820
Oh my God.

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:49.300
I keep saying that there's only three arcs left, but I keep thinking like you

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:54.340
literally, you brought this idea to me how long ago, months ago you were like,

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.940
there should be a Pettymore.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:58.500
Everybody plays Pettymore's.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:58.820
Yeah.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.980
That it's like 25 years in the future.

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.380
An old man Pettymore's property.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.380
You're trying to find the old John Lee Pettymore money.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.540
And then Drew also had $5 million.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:15.620
However, it was taken from Drew by Rosemary.

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.380
But then John took it back from her.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:24.100
And so it is in the evidence locker along with the helmet and the radio.

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:32.100
Do you have any suspicions that you're being lied to by either of your fellow PCs?

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.860
Yeah, probably Joe.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:44.100
I don't think we're getting the straight dope on the COK.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:44.900
The what?

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.100
The circle of knowledge.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.820
Oh, the COK.

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.260
I really honestly am shook that we've never called it that before.

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.260
Any theories or do you think Luke's being straight with you about what Keith Figna's up to?

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:05.220
I think Luke's been almost perfectly straight with us about what Keith Figna's been up to.

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.420
If he's pulled any punches then...

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:12.980
That's a good strategy.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.020
Yeah, like, oh, I murdered my brother.

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:20.980
Like, be upfront about that so you can hide a smaller betrayal.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:28.500
That makes me nervous about being your friend.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:30.100
That's a really good strategy.

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:31.380
It's Keith's strategy.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:34.500
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:42.500
Any other thoughts before your time to go back into the void of the waiting room is your reality?

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.220
Yeah, just namaste.

01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:45.940
Oh, thanks, bud.

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.500
Thanks, dude.

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.140
I love you.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:47.620
Love that.

01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:52.900
God, I just, I think that's so cool of you.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.300
Get the fuck out of here.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.340
Randy's gone.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:04.020
All right, let's bring in...

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:07.220
Oh, fuck, I actually used his real name.

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:09.700
We've been using fake names on the podcast this whole time.

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:10.200
Oh, shit.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.800
Uh, hey...

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.440
I accidentally said your real name.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.480
Doesn't have headphones.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.040
He doesn't have his headphones in.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.600
So I totally doxed you and...

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.960
Is his microphone even on?

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:26.540
Hey.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:27.100
Hi.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.920
Uh, hey, Luke.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:29.480
Sup, sup.

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.400
Uh, what do you think about the watch?

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.200
The watch?

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.080
Yeah, the watch.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.120
Oh, the watch.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.440
Shit, I don't really know.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.560
I think it's something to look into.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:46.280
Yeah, I remember I saw...

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.240
I was, like, digging through the ground and I saw...

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.160
What did it say?

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.920
Like, it was at Beans Pond.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.880
Is that right?

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:58.040
You did see Beans Pond in your weird, like...

01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.160
Like a vision?

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:03.320
When you put on the watch, it felt like your consciousness was changing the channel

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.560
and you began to phase out of your reality

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.920
and then you seemed to be somewhere else entirely.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.360
You felt wet grass and dirt on your fingers

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.240
and you were looking at a door in the ground

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.960
like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.840
and on the door was an inscription that said

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:32.280
So it's my parents' tomb or something?

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.960
And then I did see that that was at Beans Pond?

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.440
Or is that a different part of the vision?

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.480
I think you just saw Beans Pond, like, in that vision?

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.680
Because you brought it up later, but it's not on the overview.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.680
Okay, because I remember that part.

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:49.240
Yeah.

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.160
And that is locked up in a safe in my motel room, right?

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.680
Hotel motel, baby.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.320
So it...

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.960
I mean, definitely we need to go check that out.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.480
I even said that we need to go check out Beans Pond at one point.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.920
Yeah, you definitely did.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:08.440
So probably go get that watch and maybe see what happens if the other boys put it on.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:09.640
Hmm, interesting.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.160
Joe, write that down.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:13.560
Joe?

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.080
Joe?

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:15.720
Joe?

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:15.960
Joe?

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.640
Maladory writes,

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.040
Is there any beans left or is Keith the last standing member?

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.360
Oh, the last standing inheritor.

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.520
So my bro's dead.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.720
My parents are dead.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.320
His wife is dead.

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.800
Is my niece alive still?

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.320
Well, I don't know.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.240
We never saw her die.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:43.560
So possibly, I guess, she would inherit my brother's stuff.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:47.640
But I think it's just me, Bean, and my niece.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.120
Do you have any theories about your fellow officers?

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.680
Any secrets you think they might be hiding from you?

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.880
Things they're lying about?

01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.960
I think that Clark probably knows more than he's leading on about the circle,

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.200
since he's the only one that's visited it.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.000
I don't know if he knows more about, like, old Clark,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.960
but I think there's maybe something that he hasn't necessarily lied about,

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.080
but just hasn't let up.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.280
And then who fucking knows with Pettymore?

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.640
Nothing off the top of my head that I can think of,

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.560
like, that I have a suspicion about, but I'm sure there's something.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.160
He's always being sneaky and hiding shit.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.440
Always sneaky.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.200
Always hiding shit.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.360
John Lee Pettymore.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.160
Are we all back now?

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.520
The crew's back together.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:37.720
Welcome.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.480
Hello, everybody.

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.520
Welcome to Calm Camfy Comf Grounds.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.960
Calm Camfy Comf Grounds.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.280
No.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.680
Hey, I got another question.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.320
It's from Bazinga Begins.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:59.160
What's the coolest piece of lore or detail that no one or too few people have picked up on yet?

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:04.040
I don't use, like, so much Delta Green lore.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.520
I think it's very good and interesting,

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.760
but I am far more interested in, like, coming up with homebrew shit,

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:17.640
and so I don't use a lot of the, like, main lore about the program or the outlaws.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.040
I will here and there cherry pick stuff to use, but...

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.760
What about Zachy Reeves lore that nobody's picked up on?

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:24.520
Zachy Reeves lore.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.240
Well, we got another question here, also asked by Bazinga Begins.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:29.960
They said, related to the Kudzu no backbone

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.360
Silver Sphere relationship brought up last week,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.760
were the character developments that happened to the boys after their deaths in the Den of Sin

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.680
supposed to be a weird reversal of the Wizard of Oz?

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.400
Clark loses his heart, John Lee Pettymore loses his spine,

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.520
and Keith loses his mind and his empathy.

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:51.640
Hmm.

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:57.880
And this makes me so happy because I never thought anyone would get that, ever.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.840
I just thought I thought it was such a silly little thing

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:06.280
that, like, is so subtle and stupid that, like, no one would ever pick up on it.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:12.200
So, bless you, Bazinga Begins, for being the first person I've seen to make that connection.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:12.520
Hell yeah.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.760
I had not made that connection at all.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.480
I was so high when I put that together,

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:24.200
and it's because, uh...

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.400
It was because it's...

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:30.280
This is also really fucking stupid, but it's because Oz Mayhem Wolf was there.

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.480
Oh, wow, sure.

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.680
And I just, like, saw it and then, like, started thinking about it

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.160
because I was thinking about the spine, and then I was like,

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.880
oh, ha, ha, like, when I came up with the heart thing,

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:44.520
then I knew that we had to do something with Luke for the mind,

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.280
and I didn't know how I was going to do it.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.120
And then I sent out everybody, like,

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.800
hey, pick your talents, and Luke literally picked a talent that got rid of his empathy.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:00.200
And so he literally just, like, fulfilled it without me having to do anything.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:04.120
So that was, like, the coolest shit that made me really happy.

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:08.040
But Oz, he had a brother, and I was coming up with a brother's name,

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:15.000
and his name is Elby because Oz is ounce and Elby is pound.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.440
It's just, honestly, it's a lot of dumb little shit like that,

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:24.040
but the Wizard of Oz reversal was one of the bigger ones.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.320
That's super cool.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.600
I'm excited to talk.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:29.400
Like, at the very end of this whole, like, campaign,

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.720
I'll do a walkthrough of my dumb shit.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.320
Joe, that's one of your favorite movies, right?

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.520
Yeah, Wizard of Oz is...

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:40.120
I have the poster hanging on my wall back there.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:40.620
It's...

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.400
This one's on Joe, guys.

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.280
Which version?

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.280
The James Franco masterpiece.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:51.640
I've actually got...

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.200
So the Wizard of Oz poster is a reprint,

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.880
but I've got an original Return to Oz poster hanging over there, too.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:31:58.840
Oh, damn!

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.520
Yeah, because I love Return to Oz.

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.320
It's great, also.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.720
I honestly don't know if I've ever seen Return to Oz.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.600
It holds up, dude.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.320
It's so bizarre and cool-looking.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.280
It's good.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.600
Is it the same actors, or...?

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.000
Nah.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.920
Dorothy is played by Feruza Balk.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.400
You guys might know her from Waterboy.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.120
Interesting.

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.080
That's Kathy Bates.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.840
That's your Feruza Balk pull?

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:20.840
Yeah, for sure it is.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:26.760
Have you ever seen the HBO series about the Wizard of Oz?

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.440
Oh, boy.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.360
I was late on the uptick on that one.

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:39.400
I'll have to watch Return to Oz to come up with my plot for next season.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.880
Maladory asks,

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:47.320
For the boys, what is the plot thread you are most interested in seeing the end of?

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.520
And then another question which I don't want you to answer.

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.280
Plot thread you aren't interested in slash care the least about.

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:58.440
Be nice, guys.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.160
I just want to go back to contention.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.080
I want to see what's up with that.

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:04.280
What's up with that?

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.960
All the helmet and gun and stuff.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.360
That's what I wrote down in my notes.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:13.880
I really wish that, A, the helmet itself, but B, just all the relationships with those items

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:18.200
and all their history and all that is a thread that I would love to know more about.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.280
Yeah, I want to see how contention got the way it is

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:27.000
and why it's so connected to all this shit seemingly going back quite far in its past.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.360
I really want to see the backstory for Rich and Dick Nichols.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.480
30-something episodes of how they got.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.120
That's what the people have really been demanding.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:41.480
There's a lot of Rich and Dick stans out there who add us constantly.

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.640
They sent us pretty abusive DMs, but we get it.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:46.920
You're passionate.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.280
You're passionate for Rick and Dick.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.760
Honestly, that's a conkin.

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:53.160
Call back.

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:55.400
Yeah, hashtag conkin.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.080
That's what a lot of the stans say.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.280
All our conkers out there.

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.640
What we're saying is we hear you and if we reach a certain Patreon goal,

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:12.680
there will be just a slice of life sitcom spin-off where they're roommates.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.040
And we got one.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.080
Oh wait, sorry.

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.400
Which plot threads do you guys care the least about?

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:18.920
They're all great.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.640
And we got one last question here.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:29.080
Justin, take it away.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:34.360
BXBori9181 asks, what happened to Keith's dog?

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:40.840
They posted this question on the first Q&A and we talked about it and then we recorded

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.800
last week's episode and then they posted it on this week's episode and then edited their post

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.560
and was like, wait, just kidding.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.440
Just got there.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.640
Just got to where you answered.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.040
But someone else pointed out that we didn't really answer because while we did a freeze

01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:03.240
frame and paragraph for every animal that was in there that talked, we did not do one for Bean.

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.280
I didn't realize that, that's great.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:17.000
So the whole point of the episode was to figure out where Bean had been and we still don't know.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.720
We have the peace of mind that he's not like rotting in the hotel room.

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.220
Yeah.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.480
He's out on his own eating trash and licking ass.

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:27.880
Just like we all aim to do.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.640
All right, well, this has been long.

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.280
I'm hungry.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.640
Quantity over quality, baby.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.160
Thanks for all the questions.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.520
They were all really good, I thought.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.760
I'm glad you guys are interested enough to ask.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.040
Very insightful.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.440
Not a single wolf, the dog question in there.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.480
So fuck you guys.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.600
And I'm never coming back.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.440
So yeah, we're going to be doing some open casting for the new wolf.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:01.880
If you want to do like a cool reboot version of wolf.

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.120
Younger, hotter.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.240
Younger, hotter, yeah.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:07.320
Wolf origins.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.360
Email your auditions to what's the...

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.880
Well, just post it in the subreddit.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.960
Post it in the subreddit or tweet it at us.

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:16.840
Any auditions.

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.920
If you want to take over the editing job, you can send in your resume.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:27.720
Yeah, we'll give you like all the Patreon.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.280
I'm tired.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.160
I'm so tired.

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.760
Yeah, no, thank you all so much for listening.

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.440
This has been over for some time.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.440
No, thank you all so much.

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.440
And final word from everyone.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:46.840
Mine will be love.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.440
Your body, baby.

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:28.440
The only one trying to

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.360
have enough

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.440
to find.
