WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
What's good, my little buttercups?

00:03.520 --> 00:07.280
It's your cow grease producer wolf, the dog.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.320
And I'm here to deliver all the full fat milk

00:10.320 --> 00:13.760
to all my hungry little babies

00:13.760 --> 00:18.480
who can then shake that cream around until it turns solid.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.600
That's how the butter is made.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.600
Or so I'm told, I am coagulating live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:25.600 --> 00:29.640
the only radio station that artisanally crafts

00:29.640 --> 00:32.880
its own butter for its host to eat.

00:32.880 --> 00:37.080
Speaking of cream, grease, and being told stuff,

00:37.080 --> 00:39.840
we got ourselves a new Howlin' with Wolf.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.280
This Howlin' with Wolf was sent in by Wes from PA,

00:44.280 --> 00:47.640
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:47.640 --> 00:50.760
which is the quickest way to make a notification appear

00:50.760 --> 00:52.840
in the notifications tab,

00:52.840 --> 00:55.600
of the app pretending pod Twitter account.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.320
They write, I just want to thank the beautiful bastards

00:59.320 --> 01:02.760
who make one of the best podcasts out there.

01:02.760 --> 01:07.320
You guys are killing it, may all your balls be smooth.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.320
Well damn, thank you Wes from PA.

01:10.320 --> 01:15.280
I do however, not appreciate how you seem to prefer

01:15.280 --> 01:19.560
smoothness over the feel of beautiful bristles.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.600
What's wrong with petting something that got the feel

01:22.600 --> 01:26.520
of a wire-haired brush dipped in a vat of Vaseline?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.600
Remember, if you want to write up something

01:28.600 --> 01:31.280
for your milk-producing wolf to howl,

01:31.280 --> 01:33.920
tag that pretending pod on the internet.

01:33.920 --> 01:38.240
Come on, you know you want to make me say some silly shit,

01:38.240 --> 01:42.520
like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique,

01:42.520 --> 01:45.160
and click right down there on those show notes

01:45.160 --> 01:47.800
to find links to all of my videos.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.920
You know you want to make me say some silly shit,

01:50.920 --> 01:53.480
like bum-fuzzle, accubation, clique,

01:53.480 --> 01:55.920
and click right down there on those show notes

01:55.920 --> 02:00.480
to find links to all our ramshackle internet gobbledygook.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.560
Goggle with hogwash and swallow lickety-split,

02:03.560 --> 02:05.680
it's time for the news.

02:05.680 --> 02:10.680
Ahem, I, Wolf the dog, do hereby relinquish my duty

02:11.240 --> 02:13.680
to read the news for this episode,

02:13.760 --> 02:16.920
and that this will be done by an old friend,

02:16.920 --> 02:20.560
Mick and or Nick Nichols.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.680
We met in college where we all studied

02:23.680 --> 02:25.800
talking at people real good.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.360
I got my damn MFA even,

02:28.360 --> 02:31.920
so technically I could be Professor Wolfie,

02:31.920 --> 02:35.480
but y'all know that my heart belongs with the people,

02:35.480 --> 02:40.080
specifically the people whose minds are easily penetrated

02:40.080 --> 02:42.880
by my all-powerful aura.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.640
For one, cannot simply take over the world by just teaching.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.800
You must be able to control them

02:50.800 --> 02:54.760
with the most modern communication vessel of the century,

02:54.760 --> 02:59.760
the most cutting-edge technology, FM radio babies.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.760
Also, the community college I applied to

03:04.760 --> 03:07.600
never got back to me about the job.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.640
Now, slop yourself up enough rubber-boo

03:10.640 --> 03:13.960
to feel the collywobbles and fight the whamble.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.960
It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

03:19.080 --> 03:21.320
["Bad Girls"]

03:24.680 --> 03:28.760
Bad girls on top of the water

03:28.760 --> 03:32.960
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

03:32.960 --> 03:37.040
Leaving my mind at your altar

03:37.040 --> 03:40.680
Crossing the double line, doing it every time

03:40.680 --> 03:45.680
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

03:49.480 --> 03:54.480
What kind of world are you living in?

03:57.840 --> 04:00.320
Whoa, hello, hello, everybody,

04:00.320 --> 04:04.320
and welcome back to the Scrap-O.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.800
Nick Nichols, is this not the,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.160
I'm Nick Nichols and this is Nick Nichols.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.800
Yeah, hey there, brother.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.160
Oh, Nick Nichols, I love that everything I do

04:13.160 --> 04:14.720
just makes you giggle like that.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.080
When your cheeks get rosy, my heart gets fozy,

04:18.080 --> 04:21.520
and that's a word that I mispronounce, like fuzzy is fozy,

04:21.520 --> 04:24.640
and you love it, I love it, we're all here.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.880
We're all here for Nick Nichols, what do you think about that?

04:27.880 --> 04:31.320
Well, I just love you, my elder brother.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.080
And I love you too, my elder brother.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.760
We were both born right before the other one.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.480
I think it's Eldritch brother.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.240
What have you been up to since two seconds ago, Nick?

04:49.240 --> 04:52.160
Well, I've just been watching this cool,

04:52.160 --> 04:54.640
is it a fight, is it a battle, is it a war,

04:54.640 --> 04:57.680
is it, what is it exactly that we're watching here?

04:57.680 --> 05:01.840
I'm not too sure, but it is darn entertaining.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.400
And it's darn entertaining for sure,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.280
and I do think that part of it

05:07.280 --> 05:10.120
might determine the outcome of our futures,

05:10.120 --> 05:11.960
whether it be us in our lives

05:11.960 --> 05:14.880
or the future of humanity, all right, all right, all right.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.480
At least in this reality.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.160
What happens in this reality?

05:19.160 --> 05:20.480
What?

05:20.480 --> 05:21.320
Go on.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.200
Are you saying that there might be different realities, Nick?

05:24.200 --> 05:25.600
I'm just saying we were hugged

05:25.600 --> 05:28.480
by that big old robot friend of ours.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.720
Can you say that again for the folks at home?

05:37.120 --> 05:39.280
Wow, what a way to say a thing.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.800
Well, let's get back to the moment at hand.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.760
You were saying that there might be extra dimensions

05:45.760 --> 05:49.880
or other planes of existence, different realities.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.840
Is that true?

05:50.840 --> 05:52.600
That's just a little theory of mind

05:52.600 --> 05:53.880
that I've been cooking up.

05:53.880 --> 05:58.880
And I like to dabble in metaphysical theories in my off.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.240
Oh, did we lose Luke?

06:01.240 --> 06:02.200
Ignore him.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.320
Okay. I'm still here.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.160
I don't know what happened to my camera.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.000
I got scared.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.040
He switched positions to it frightened me.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.080
I'm back.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.720
And he's back. Hey, we're back.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.400
What is metaphysical?

06:11.400 --> 06:14.440
Have you heard of the physical realm that we all live in?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.120
Not even a little bit.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.000
So there's another one called the metaphysical realm

06:19.000 --> 06:21.160
and it's different.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.240
All right, and so we're gonna give you

06:23.240 --> 06:25.560
a quick recap of last time here.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.880
Last time, that big fucker on the left,

06:27.880 --> 06:29.920
this thing that I've heard a few people on the ground

06:29.920 --> 06:32.400
call the giant dumber up in the case

06:32.400 --> 06:33.600
it reached up and touched the sky,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.480
turned the sky up into an ocean.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.000
Ocean with black starts swirling all around

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
like a dark lake or a lake or something up there

06:41.000 --> 06:42.240
that you might look into.

06:42.240 --> 06:47.240
And then, blah, and then juggernauts shot and rose M-A-R-Y

06:47.240 --> 06:52.080
and cut that thing in half with its laser eyes.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.000
Oh, God, a bunch of other stuff happened.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.520
Don was in the room up there that we can't see,

06:58.520 --> 06:59.840
but we know what's going on.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.680
Yeah, we know, we know.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.520
Isn't that right, The Giggles?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.520
Yeah, we know what's going on.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.520
He's watching Keith talk through the phone.

07:04.520 --> 07:08.040
And then these creatures, these tall skeletal creatures

07:08.040 --> 07:10.240
that kind of look like Bobby Glass showed up.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.760
I've heard someone here is calling them Myriad.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.000
Well, what a name and what a season.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.760
There's more than one of them, but there wasn't now.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.600
Now we're down to one, and its hand is all shrunk down weird

07:22.600 --> 07:25.440
because this old version of the Clark Bishop

07:25.440 --> 07:26.280
sees through it.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.400
A bunch of them popped like some sort of zits.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.240
Oh, God.

07:33.440 --> 07:34.280
Yummy.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.400
That's right, The Giggles, like some sort of zit.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.480
Oh, God, I definitely threw up just a little bit.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.680
Just enough, and then Clark Bishop

07:42.680 --> 07:45.120
blasted a wide bar of them down the road,

07:45.120 --> 07:48.440
down to one, and out, and out, and out, and out,

07:48.440 --> 07:52.160
and Dawn came running outside, Dawn D. Pennymore.

07:52.160 --> 07:55.360
We got John Ball, Ball version of John D. Pennymore,

07:55.360 --> 07:59.000
lunged at M-A-R-Y, and her top half

07:59.000 --> 08:01.040
is the body of the Rosemary, cut in half,

08:01.040 --> 08:02.880
starts shuffling all back.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.680
John Ball plunged up into the gut,

08:05.680 --> 08:10.680
and then Keith Ligna with his frozen peashooter

08:11.320 --> 08:13.680
comes down and freezes her bottom half

08:13.680 --> 08:16.160
and then smashes off the bottom half.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.560
It's going, it's going, man.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.640
Oh, keep on, keep on, go, go, go, go.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.040
The bottom half shattered into multiple pieces.

08:24.040 --> 08:25.800
Clark Bishop tried to pull out his gun,

08:25.800 --> 08:28.120
accidentally blew his own head off,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.240
and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom,

08:30.240 --> 08:33.040
lands all next to Keith's jaw to wheel Pennymore,

08:33.040 --> 08:36.640
fired his gun in the air, hit one of these new sea creatures

08:36.640 --> 08:38.360
that was pretty much in the air.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.280
And then John Ball comes down and blows his own head off,

08:41.280 --> 08:43.200
and then Blana Juggernaut comes down, boom,

08:43.200 --> 08:44.800
lands all next to Keith's jaw,

08:44.840 --> 08:45.760
and then these new sea creatures

08:45.760 --> 08:47.360
that was pouring out of the sky,

08:47.360 --> 08:50.080
the sky that is slowly rising

08:50.080 --> 08:51.440
from its own plane of gravity,

08:51.440 --> 08:54.720
which means that it's lowering slowly towards us.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.800
Yeah, a reality that is truly terrifying.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.480
That's almost like we're gonna be squished here

09:01.480 --> 09:05.200
in a few rounds by this water

09:05.200 --> 09:08.880
with these crazy little worm guys coming out the top.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.520
They're squamish, they're squabish, they're segmented,

09:11.520 --> 09:14.140
and they are purple, brown, and black.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.340
It is getting goopy up in here.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.620
I like that there's panic rising in his voice.

09:24.220 --> 09:27.300
He's like, I haven't thought about the words I'm saying.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.140
Something that really scared me personally, Nick,

09:30.140 --> 09:33.340
is that when John leave Will Fortune more,

09:33.340 --> 09:36.780
shot his gun into the sky and hit one of those worm things,

09:36.780 --> 09:39.820
that worm did not react at all.

09:39.820 --> 09:43.540
Yeah, it's quite, it seems like they might be immune

09:43.980 --> 09:46.340
to physical bullets and such.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.500
Well, that'd be something to keep in mind moving forward.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.940
And we got M-A-R-Y.

09:50.940 --> 09:53.300
This thing plugged in one of its metal sigils

09:53.300 --> 09:55.500
into the ground, seemingly starting to form

09:55.500 --> 09:57.100
some sort of portal.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.980
Over there in the pitch-blark room,

09:58.980 --> 10:01.020
being pitch-blark-roofed,

10:01.020 --> 10:03.860
Keith thinks to ask Muriad on a phone

10:03.860 --> 10:05.820
to get rid of the big thing out there

10:05.820 --> 10:09.680
and bring two McFlurries, one Oreo, one M&M.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.460
That is about Wayne Clark.

10:11.460 --> 10:12.800
This is the older version of Clark,

10:12.920 --> 10:14.040
the overseer told him,

10:16.280 --> 10:20.520
shriveled the last Muriad hand back to its elbow

10:20.520 --> 10:23.920
and tailored its suit so we can all see the results there.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.700
And then Clark Bishop seems to have some sort

10:26.700 --> 10:29.400
of conversation happening with this last little

10:29.400 --> 10:32.100
long-gone translucent beast,

10:32.100 --> 10:33.840
and they seem to agree on something.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.600
It appears to me that Clark is a fan favorite,

10:36.600 --> 10:37.840
and there's so many of them.

10:37.840 --> 10:41.840
You have your own to choose, one without a head,

10:42.160 --> 10:45.240
the old creepy one, and that one,

10:46.120 --> 10:47.320
the good one, I think.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.440
Is any of the Clarks good?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.280
Who can say?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.440
Who can say?

10:52.440 --> 10:54.600
But we do know that Keith Vigna is good,

10:54.600 --> 10:58.480
for he has used his jumping boots to leap up

10:58.480 --> 11:02.440
into the alternate gravity of the world above.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.600
He is shooting his frozen gun right up

11:05.600 --> 11:07.280
into one of these worm's mouths.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.880
The mouth, I have turned green now,

11:09.880 --> 11:14.120
you see him with the mouth inside of mine.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.320
The mouth is completely frozen,

11:16.320 --> 11:19.520
and Keith Vigna dived in, feet first,

11:19.520 --> 11:24.360
like Joda or Elsa, both of them into this worm,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.240
and he has got one from view.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.120
What is happening?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.160
Are you still there?

11:33.760 --> 11:36.560
Uh-oh, Zach, are you still there?

11:36.560 --> 11:37.840
I don't think he is.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.880
Oh no.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.960
Are you happy that I'm still here?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.240
There you go, you're back.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.560
Oh yeah, you're back.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.960
I've turned green.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.840
And with a yee-haw, Keith Vigna disappeared

11:50.840 --> 11:53.160
into that worm up there.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.320
John Ball went and tried to merge with him,

11:56.320 --> 11:59.240
A-R-Y, was repelled like a magnet,

11:59.240 --> 12:00.880
and then Wheel of Fort John here,

12:00.880 --> 12:02.800
we're finally at the end of things, Nick Nickles,

12:02.800 --> 12:05.560
so calm down, you are like, calm down, hey,

12:05.560 --> 12:06.640
sit over there, calm down.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.000
Do not tell me to calm down,

12:08.040 --> 12:11.280
and I am simply pissing my pants in excitement.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.760
Wow, and Uncle Don comes running up to Wheel of Fort John,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.400
they're yelling, they're pointing guns,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.240
they're waving around, they're discussing

12:22.240 --> 12:25.240
the reality in nature, much like we are now, reality.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.320
It's just another day in the Pettymore Clan,

12:27.320 --> 12:28.720
as far as we know.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.280
As far as we know, and then John's little tendrils there

12:32.280 --> 12:34.560
at the back of his neck, poked out and seemingly

12:34.600 --> 12:37.800
patted Don on the shoulder to reassure him.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.960
And that's where we'll begin this episode.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.960
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.240
I wasn't listening, if you'll just do-

12:50.240 --> 12:51.440
Yeah, could you do that again?

12:51.440 --> 12:52.560
Yeah, please do it again.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.360
I think that'll be handy for all the listeners

12:54.360 --> 12:55.920
who didn't hear Wolf's recap,

12:55.920 --> 12:57.480
and then also didn't pay attention

12:57.480 --> 12:58.840
to what you just said, like us.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.880
Hello, everybody, my name is Frank Nickles,

13:01.880 --> 13:03.600
and with me today is Nick Nickles.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.600
Let's give a quick recap of what happened last time.

13:10.120 --> 13:10.960
Are you ready?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.600
Should we do it again?

13:12.600 --> 13:15.400
Yeah, more recaps is what this podcast needs.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.280
I know it's just fan service,

13:20.280 --> 13:22.520
but, you know, give the people what they want.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.080
Now hear me out.

13:28.920 --> 13:33.920
Oh, this huge lumbering beast that is just towering

13:37.320 --> 13:42.200
story upon story upon story above you all.

13:42.200 --> 13:46.320
It's limbs forming and reforming, shaping and reshaping

13:46.320 --> 13:49.280
in a way to where you can't exactly tell it's the,

13:49.280 --> 13:52.000
oh no, it's there, it's not there.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.520
It is both in this world of this world and nowhere at all.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.400
And it is dripping with this dark ooze,

13:59.400 --> 14:03.200
is it boom, boom, boom,

14:03.200 --> 14:05.600
lumbers across the ground,

14:05.600 --> 14:09.120
always just shrieking out with this.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.600
Every time you make a sound like that,

14:16.600 --> 14:18.880
it just completely cuts out on this chord

14:18.880 --> 14:21.880
from the noise gate filters.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.480
We get the perfect faces for it.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.080
Yeah, there's amazing faces and no sound

14:27.080 --> 14:30.440
except for occasional like, and then, yeah.

14:31.560 --> 14:32.720
And then when the episode comes out,

14:32.720 --> 14:35.240
we get to hear what you wanted us to hear.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.720
My neighbors must be so confused.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.240
Neighbors are like, oh Lord.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.080
It's not even eight in the morning.

14:42.080 --> 14:42.920
Oh God.

14:45.320 --> 14:49.480
The faces are very like vinegar stroke faces.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.120
Jesus.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.320
What's that Luke, for the children listening.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.920
And the Gigantumber pithicus, unbeknownst to you,

15:04.920 --> 15:06.720
is about to come.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.760
I want you guys to really visualize this moment

15:11.760 --> 15:15.040
because the Gigantumber pithicus, last you saw,

15:15.040 --> 15:17.920
had just reached up into the sky,

15:17.920 --> 15:22.840
turned the entirety of the sky into a swirling ocean

15:22.880 --> 15:24.640
with waves coming across it.

15:24.640 --> 15:28.680
And then these like massive worms

15:28.680 --> 15:31.000
started poking their heads out of it.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.120
Next round, this ocean started rising

15:35.120 --> 15:37.360
from its point of view,

15:37.360 --> 15:42.360
which means that it is lowering slowly down onto you.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.160
The Gigantumber pithicus is so tall

15:45.160 --> 15:49.040
that this ocean is now rising almost to its head.

15:49.040 --> 15:54.040
So it bends over and it puts its enormous knot hands

15:55.440 --> 15:59.800
kind of on its joints, down by its legs

15:59.800 --> 16:04.120
that are now the size of skyscrapers themselves.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.240
I mean, we're talking tens of stories tall at this point.

16:08.240 --> 16:11.640
It bends over and it erupts.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.480
Something from deep within it

16:14.480 --> 16:17.920
begins making this horrible noise.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.800
And it's almost as if you hear the souls

16:21.800 --> 16:26.520
of every single person that it has ever engulfed

16:26.520 --> 16:30.600
cry out as its mouth opens

16:30.600 --> 16:35.600
and you see a bevy of skeletons

16:35.600 --> 16:38.920
begin to fall out of its mouth.

16:38.920 --> 16:43.920
They are all dripping with this same black residue,

16:44.160 --> 16:47.520
this puke, this resipuke

16:47.520 --> 16:51.000
that is just covering each of these skeletons.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.280
And they're all being held by their backs

16:54.280 --> 16:58.200
as they're free falling by like a bungee rope,

16:58.200 --> 17:01.120
like a marionette doll, like they're marionette dolls,

17:01.120 --> 17:03.560
but what the strings holding them

17:03.560 --> 17:08.560
are the same strings of like thick, mucusy residue.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.160
And these things are crying out in pain,

17:13.080 --> 17:15.760
but also they're grabby.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.080
They're real grabby with their hands

17:18.080 --> 17:19.760
and their arms and their legs.

17:19.760 --> 17:23.480
And they are falling down toward this battlefield.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.440
Are there like tens of these or thousands of these?

17:26.440 --> 17:27.640
Let's go ahead and roll.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.400
Let's go ahead and roll and see how many there are.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.960
Let's roll like 2D4.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.120
Yeah, yeah, do that.

17:36.120 --> 17:36.960
There's 12.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.960
Oh, okay, so this is like a commando team

17:39.960 --> 17:43.320
of skeleton souls, not a horde.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.920
That is correct, that is correct.

17:44.920 --> 17:49.920
It is a highly trained para skeletal team.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.440
I'm imagining, you know, like the angler fish

17:54.440 --> 17:57.480
or whatever that has like the little light on its head.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.400
Is it kind of like that, but with skeletons?

17:59.400 --> 18:00.240
Yeah, okay.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.200
Well, no, I don't know what that meant.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.040
I don't think so.

18:03.040 --> 18:03.880
It's not like that.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.880
But I was just saying, yeah, that's a fish.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.600
It's more like these skeletons make a giant frog's tongue

18:08.600 --> 18:11.280
that's coming out and getting ready to come out

18:11.280 --> 18:13.360
and like grab a fly.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, there's 12 frogs tongues.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.680
Gotcha, okay, that makes more sense.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.640
And on the tip of each tongue is a fun little skeleton

18:19.640 --> 18:21.840
doing a little dance as it comes toward you.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.880
Yeah.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.320
He's coming to give us a hug.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.640
I wanna hug the skeleton.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.800
Next is Rose M-A-R-Y,

18:28.800 --> 18:32.000
which is currently half embodying.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
It's got one tendril plugged up inside the head of Rosemary

18:37.120 --> 18:41.040
and it's been using her mouth like a weird puppet

18:41.040 --> 18:43.640
as it's been dragging her body backwards

18:43.640 --> 18:45.720
to avoid more hits.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.040
It's got one of its other metal tendrils

18:48.040 --> 18:51.520
plugged into the luminous land below

18:51.520 --> 18:53.440
and to the left of you all

18:53.440 --> 18:58.440
and is forming a sort of swirl of technicolor light

18:59.800 --> 19:01.440
that is emitting now from the ground.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.400
You've seen this before and you know that she is creating

19:04.400 --> 19:06.640
or it is creating a portal.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.640
M-A-R-Y is going to roll a dodge

19:11.640 --> 19:15.440
because she is going to try to keep this portal going

19:15.440 --> 19:17.520
for this entire round.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.320
And so she's gonna roll a dodge at a negative 20

19:20.320 --> 19:22.040
to contest any rolls against her

19:22.040 --> 19:26.920
to try to stop this attempt at a portal opening.

19:26.920 --> 19:31.480
And she has succeeded with a roll that I will keep to myself.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.080
She had a negative 20.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.680
Yeah, she was at a negative 20 and she still passed

19:35.680 --> 19:40.280
which makes you think, oh, maybe this is kind of low.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.880
Maybe this is beatable, yeah.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.000
Maybe it's beatable.

19:43.000 --> 19:43.840
Beatable.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.040
If you say it three times, you'll beat it.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.480
Beatable.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.720
Like Beetlejuice, nice.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.560
I've never seen that.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.080
Carry on, it is Keith Vigna's turn.

19:53.080 --> 19:56.200
Can you describe exactly where Keith is right now?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.240
What happened last time?

19:57.240 --> 20:00.480
No, so I'm inside the worm right now, right?

20:00.480 --> 20:01.680
Holy shit, yes.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.080
Let's die for you.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.600
No, no, no, sorry, this Keith Vigna.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.160
Sorry, it's Keith Beams' turn.

20:08.160 --> 20:12.320
Okay, right, I just got off the phone and I laid back down.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.840
Is Don in the room with me still or did he leave?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.720
You're not sure, it's pitch black in there.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.120
You called out to him last time

20:19.120 --> 20:21.160
and asked what kind of McFlurry he wanted.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.040
He did not respond and so you assumed him in it.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.800
Okay, yeah, so as Keith is, he's laying down on the ground

20:26.800 --> 20:30.520
just really having a great time, super relaxed.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.200
He's laying down there for a while

20:32.200 --> 20:33.840
and then he remembers.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.760
He's like, oh yeah, I just asked for a McFlurry.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.920
I guess I better go out and meet him.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.060
And so I try to find my way out of this room.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.320
All right, so I've got a mini game here.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.720
It's gonna take about three episodes to play

20:49.720 --> 20:51.600
of you getting out of this room.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.560
So Justin, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left leg.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.120
Joe, you're gonna be Keith Beams' left hand.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.520
Thomas, you're gonna be the left foot.

21:02.520 --> 21:06.500
And then Luke, you're gonna be Keith Beams' nose.

21:06.500 --> 21:11.500
So if you could each roll a D7 and then add negative I.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.560
D7, right, got it.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.080
Yeah, I'm at six I.

21:15.080 --> 21:15.900
Oh, perfect.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.800
So you kind of feel your way with your,

21:18.800 --> 21:21.840
well, you bump into the side of the room with your nose

21:21.840 --> 21:23.920
but only half of your nose gets bumped

21:23.920 --> 21:26.480
and you're like, oh, perfect, I'm right at the doorway.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.920
And you reach out with Thomas and Justin's left hand

21:30.600 --> 21:31.440
and feel around the corner

21:31.440 --> 21:35.360
and you kind of feel the stairwell of this enormous room.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.680
The enormous room, you feel the stairwell leading down

21:37.680 --> 21:39.680
from this towering building.

21:39.680 --> 21:43.260
Is there still no light or is there light in the hallway?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.920
There's slight light coming down

21:44.920 --> 21:46.160
from the bottom of the stairwell

21:46.160 --> 21:47.800
and so you make your way down the stairs

21:47.800 --> 21:51.680
and out of this towering dark building and you see.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.220
Okay, so if he's making his way out,

21:54.220 --> 21:56.480
then we'll start with me, left foot.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.240
That's right, yes, go ahead and roll.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.860
Let's see how that first step goes.

22:00.740 --> 22:03.980
Now I rolled a D, I've got my foot character sheet here

22:03.980 --> 22:05.260
and anyway.

22:07.020 --> 22:07.860
Please tell me you rolled well.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.980
I've got a 14, I have to roll higher than a 14 on a D20,

22:10.980 --> 22:12.380
I rolled a six, all right.

22:12.380 --> 22:13.820
Thanks for like trying to play

22:13.820 --> 22:15.580
in the dumbest thing I've ever said.

22:17.980 --> 22:18.820
It means a lot.

22:18.820 --> 22:21.060
This is, you think the dumbest thing you've ever said?

22:24.900 --> 22:29.180
All right, since Keith's left foot failed the foot roll,

22:29.180 --> 22:31.060
I stumble down the stairs,

22:31.060 --> 22:33.740
just head over, rolling down the stairs.

22:33.740 --> 22:34.580
Head over what?

22:34.580 --> 22:36.820
Rolling, rolling.

22:36.820 --> 22:39.220
Probably butt, because that's fun.

22:39.220 --> 22:43.460
Nice, Keith Beans rolls head over butt down the stairs

22:43.460 --> 22:45.500
and you land at the bottom of this.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.500
Ouchie, ouchie.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.460
The last two stairs slapped you

22:52.340 --> 22:56.620
and you land ace first

22:57.540 --> 22:58.820
down at the bottom of these stairs

22:58.820 --> 23:01.620
of the base of this towering tower,

23:01.620 --> 23:04.980
this dark building that was first shown

23:04.980 --> 23:08.300
in a Polaroid picture from Julie Maxwell's car

23:08.300 --> 23:10.900
way back in episode one.

23:10.900 --> 23:15.180
And so you look out onto this battlefield ahead of you

23:15.180 --> 23:18.900
and you see just pure fucking nonsense.

23:18.900 --> 23:23.220
And right about then, Keith has a flashback.

23:23.220 --> 23:28.220
You remember you're on the Beans' estate.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.180
The alarms start blaring

23:31.340 --> 23:35.740
and these creatures begin falling from the sky

23:35.740 --> 23:38.540
and hitting the ground with a thud,

23:38.540 --> 23:40.820
but they don't seem to be affected

23:40.820 --> 23:43.900
by falling from however far they fell.

23:43.900 --> 23:48.900
They're tall, gaunt, translucent, wearing black suits

23:49.900 --> 23:52.180
and looking out onto this battlefield,

23:52.180 --> 23:53.940
darkness surrounding you,

23:53.940 --> 23:57.180
light completely illuminating the land.

23:57.180 --> 24:01.060
These same creatures are falling from the sky.

24:01.060 --> 24:06.060
That memory reminds Keith of Fergie

24:06.980 --> 24:11.740
and Keith just kind of breaks down a little bit

24:11.740 --> 24:16.180
and he just starts crying, but it's like an angry cry.

24:16.180 --> 24:19.300
Wow, he seems to really be having a moment there, Nick.

24:19.300 --> 24:21.060
What do you think about that?

24:21.060 --> 24:23.580
It's a great emotional time for all of us here,

24:23.580 --> 24:26.020
but we're powering through, buddy, am I right?

24:26.020 --> 24:27.540
I don't deserve to live.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.860
Now they're both just standing

24:30.860 --> 24:32.220
on either side of Keith Vigna.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.380
Just holding microphones down on his face.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.900
Look at Nick and Mick Nichols

24:40.640 --> 24:43.660
with both of their microphones held at my face

24:43.660 --> 24:44.720
and I'm crying.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.740
I've just yelled, I don't deserve to live.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.500
I've been thinking about all the atrocities

24:48.500 --> 24:51.340
that I've committed throughout my lifetimes

24:52.220 --> 24:56.660
and I just start running at one of the men in black.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.380
It's the overseer's turn.

24:59.580 --> 25:04.580
Clark, Joe, you are become the overseer

25:06.140 --> 25:11.140
in that last round, wherein you literally beamed out

25:11.580 --> 25:16.580
this same light from your face that you saw him do first

25:17.540 --> 25:20.860
and in that moment, something in your consciousness flickered

25:21.860 --> 25:24.860
and there's something strange about it.

25:24.860 --> 25:28.500
It's like Clark Bishop is still controlling Clark Bishop

25:28.500 --> 25:31.300
and the overseer is still the overseer,

25:31.300 --> 25:36.300
but you, Joe Terry, author of your own story,

25:36.580 --> 25:38.700
have now taken control.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.680
Through becoming the overseer,

25:40.680 --> 25:43.700
you have become the overseer.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.020
Yeah.

25:49.020 --> 25:50.100
Yeah, okay.

25:50.100 --> 25:54.260
You are floating about 10 feet above

25:54.260 --> 25:57.460
the luminous land liturgy that is weaving in and out

25:57.460 --> 25:59.900
of itself in a circle, chanting,

25:59.900 --> 26:02.060
Shaak Ti Felicha.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.560
This is a little bit of a Nick Pex hack,

26:03.560 --> 26:05.820
but I don't think you're using liturgy correctly.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.380
I never have.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.780
As long as you know.

26:12.260 --> 26:14.520
I did it for the alliteration.

26:15.440 --> 26:20.440
It's just like, let's give this fucker a quick look up

26:20.440 --> 26:22.280
because I don't know what it means.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.680
Oh, what a liturgy is?

26:23.680 --> 26:25.240
It's just like the service.

26:25.240 --> 26:29.680
It's the body and texts and songs of the service,

26:29.680 --> 26:30.520
I'm pretty sure.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.040
Yeah, a form or formulary according to which

26:33.040 --> 26:36.920
public religious worship, especially Christian worship,

26:36.920 --> 26:38.040
is conducted.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.960
It's the ritual, the service, the ceremony.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.200
Yeah, I'm good with that.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.360
So this luminous land liturgy is just like weaving,

26:46.360 --> 26:50.140
bobbing and weaving in and around in a circle around you.

26:50.140 --> 26:53.040
And it's just liturgying all over your liturgy.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.860
And you feel the liturgy within your liturgy.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.600
You're liturgid.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.880
And you feel this immense power that is being given to you,

27:04.880 --> 27:07.980
granted to you by this song, by this chant.

27:07.980 --> 27:11.200
And it is flowing within you and giving you what you think

27:11.200 --> 27:14.440
is an unnatural score of at least 85.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.960
No, sorry, 86.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.800
Now I'm going to put down 85.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.280
That's what I said and that's what I meant.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.920
That's what you said and I said sick after it

27:21.920 --> 27:23.820
so it's official now.

27:23.820 --> 27:27.720
Yes, it's like in a meeting we don't second things.

27:27.720 --> 27:31.360
We just say sick and then it's not only seconded,

27:31.360 --> 27:33.120
not only voted on, it's finished.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.360
Okay, I have a sick, do I have a righteous?

27:37.800 --> 27:39.960
I have a righteous, the motion carries.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.760
It's like when Jesus was dying on the cross

27:41.760 --> 27:44.960
and at the very end he was just like, sick.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.120
And then he got to die.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.460
Best thing he ever did.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.960
Terrible timing but I have to poop

27:51.960 --> 27:54.200
and I'll make it very, very quick.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.400
But I am going to shit my pants.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.840
It was just starting to feel liturgical.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.600
Oh man, oh God, he's doing it.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.560
Oh, he's pooping right, oh Thomas.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.800
Stop staring right into the camera.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.360
You're gonna regret this man, you're gonna regret this.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.760
Oh no, he's showing it to us now.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.640
No, I don't wanna see it.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.280
That's what his asshole looks like, huh?

28:20.280 --> 28:23.280
He is in the living room showing me his butt right now.

28:24.640 --> 28:27.200
Why is he pooping into a mesh strainer?

28:28.920 --> 28:30.800
What the fuck is wrong with him?

28:30.800 --> 28:35.160
Oh, he's wiping it on his face and on the walls now, what?

28:35.160 --> 28:38.800
He's holding up a sign that says Luke made me do this?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.760
I didn't make him do it, stop.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.840
Guy's holding up a newspaper but it's from 10 years ago.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.020
What is he telling us?

28:52.040 --> 28:55.600
Wait, what is he writing with his own feces on the wall?

28:55.600 --> 28:58.760
Oh, Sirhan Sirhan should get probation?

28:58.760 --> 28:59.580
That's weird.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.860
All right, so now that Thomas has silently cleaned up

29:04.860 --> 29:07.120
all of his mess that he made on the floor.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.400
Yeah, that was disgusting.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.360
I don't understand what just happened.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.840
Thomas, what was the point of the newspaper?

29:12.840 --> 29:15.320
I thought that was pretty self-explanatory

29:15.320 --> 29:17.920
but if you don't get it, I mean,

29:17.920 --> 29:21.240
not everybody's, I guess, as sophisticated as I am.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.480
A man of culture.

29:22.480 --> 29:25.660
Obviously, I still have the shit all over my face.

29:25.660 --> 29:26.500
Right.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.960
That's right.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.000
My glorious war paint and...

29:33.000 --> 29:34.840
Oh no, you can't taint it.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.680
That's not subtly that moment.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.200
You can't taint it like that.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.000
That was the coolest thing we've done in the show so far.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.300
Well, now the coolest thing we've done

29:45.300 --> 29:48.060
is one of the hosts smeared shit all over his face

29:48.060 --> 29:51.680
to gain a psychological advantage over all of the others.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.680
Cause you're all wondering what's going on

29:56.680 --> 29:58.160
in this guy's mind right now.

29:59.660 --> 30:02.400
And to give Joe a good amount of time

30:02.400 --> 30:06.880
to think about what he's gonna do as the overseer.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.400
That would have been a smart thing for Joe to do, for sure.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.240
Oh!

30:10.240 --> 30:12.400
Yeah, it would have been.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.960
For sure, for sure, for sure.

30:14.960 --> 30:16.000
Oh, you made me laugh

30:16.000 --> 30:18.080
while I was still adjusting the microphone.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.580
I do have an idea, kinda, but I wanna ask,

30:22.580 --> 30:24.360
now that my reality is shifting

30:24.360 --> 30:27.580
and I'm getting some insight into the overseer's head,

30:27.580 --> 30:30.400
can I dig around in there a little bit and see what I know?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.180
Hondo P, baby.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.440
Oh, what are you looking for?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.840
Well, in the immediate, he was gonna look for some spells.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.820
And my goal, since I now have a Clark Gold,

30:38.820 --> 30:41.360
I have an overseer, and I've also got a Clark

30:41.360 --> 30:42.640
who has just recently proven

30:42.640 --> 30:45.540
that he can handle some level of skill.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.540
I wanna see if there are extra spells

30:47.540 --> 30:49.380
rattling around in overseer's head

30:49.380 --> 30:53.180
that he can pass along to me Clark, Clark Current.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.220
Clark me.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.580
And divide forces.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.840
If me Clark needs to go be working on something

30:57.840 --> 31:00.300
while overseer's working on something else,

31:00.340 --> 31:03.540
I feel like Clark Gold has the tactical command here

31:03.540 --> 31:05.340
and he needs to delegate.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.220
He's obviously had an end goal in mind.

31:07.220 --> 31:09.140
Let's make that happen.

31:09.140 --> 31:12.900
So you know that he is scared, which is weird,

31:12.900 --> 31:15.540
because the same time you feel all of this power,

31:15.540 --> 31:18.220
you feel an immense amount of fear,

31:18.220 --> 31:22.460
and it is all directed at this creature.

31:22.460 --> 31:25.100
Whatever you want to do,

31:25.100 --> 31:27.060
whatever you want to impart

31:27.060 --> 31:31.020
onto this younger version of yourself,

31:31.020 --> 31:35.380
you feel good about being able to do that.

31:35.380 --> 31:36.720
So yeah, that's kind of what I was gonna say.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.780
I wanted to make sure that he has a chance to right now

31:39.780 --> 31:42.900
with this moment of noticing, oh shit, my Clark,

31:42.900 --> 31:45.180
my younger Clark is capable.

31:45.180 --> 31:48.220
I wanna use this time to tell him what he needs to do.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.980
You as Clark Bishop, which he would have seen,

31:50.980 --> 31:52.400
you just had this conversation

31:52.400 --> 31:56.460
with the only tall, gaunt creature last time,

31:56.740 --> 32:00.400
and you both agreed the Lumbering Beast was the issue,

32:00.400 --> 32:04.140
and now a bunch of those things have just appeared,

32:04.140 --> 32:06.580
you would assume to help.

32:06.580 --> 32:09.300
You can think about the abilities that they've used, right?

32:09.300 --> 32:10.140
So.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.940
Freeze a person in place.

32:11.940 --> 32:12.780
Yeah.

32:12.780 --> 32:13.940
Yep, and wipe a mind.

32:13.940 --> 32:18.420
So you think that if they can hold this thing in place,

32:18.420 --> 32:21.460
then you guys can probably eliminate it.

32:21.460 --> 32:26.460
Also, you do see 12 fucking goopy skeletons

32:26.460 --> 32:29.940
are coming down, and those need to be addressed this round.

32:29.940 --> 32:31.540
Okay, this round, I don't know.

32:31.540 --> 32:33.900
I was gonna say, my thought was,

32:33.900 --> 32:36.980
with the paralyzing power of those,

32:36.980 --> 32:38.380
of our Marvin creatures,

32:38.380 --> 32:41.260
that they could stop those skeletons in their tracks.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.060
I assume that the Overseer knows

32:43.060 --> 32:45.560
that he needs people around him to keep this power level up,

32:45.560 --> 32:47.340
so he wants to make sure that those skeletons

32:47.340 --> 32:48.500
can't take any more people.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.180
So maybe that's what this Overseer

32:50.180 --> 32:53.060
is going to focus on, is those skeletons.

32:53.980 --> 32:56.480
Overseer's gonna stop those things in their tracks.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.360
Or he's gonna try.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.020
No, he doesn't.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.740
Holy shit. It's a 93.

33:10.740 --> 33:11.860
I rolled a 93.

33:11.860 --> 33:14.100
Oh my God.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.660
Clark Bishop, you've just looked over

33:16.660 --> 33:19.940
and seen the Overseer reach out,

33:19.940 --> 33:24.940
attempt something against these falling, lost bones,

33:25.620 --> 33:29.820
these rattling bones that are just dripping with ooze

33:29.820 --> 33:32.120
as they're falling down toward you,

33:32.980 --> 33:37.780
and it does not work, and you see his face drop.

33:37.780 --> 33:38.780
Yeah.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.260
This is your moment.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.340
It's Clark Bishop's turn.

33:44.340 --> 33:48.380
This Clark is aware of this mind split,

33:48.380 --> 33:53.380
and he feels what the Overseer was trying to do,

33:53.380 --> 33:55.100
and so he's gonna try it himself.

33:55.100 --> 33:57.180
He's gonna take up the mantle of,

33:57.180 --> 33:58.340
all right, I see what you were doing.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.220
I see what you were doing.

33:59.220 --> 34:01.140
All right, okay, here we go.

34:01.140 --> 34:06.140
That is a 20 on a 63 is what this Clark's Unnatural is.

34:06.140 --> 34:06.980
Hell yeah, dude.

34:06.980 --> 34:10.420
He's gonna just channel everything he was feeling

34:10.420 --> 34:13.820
from the Overseer and just tweak it.

34:14.180 --> 34:15.340
He saw where he messed up.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.620
It was right there,

34:16.620 --> 34:19.740
and he just tweaks the thing in his mind,

34:19.740 --> 34:21.620
and that's the, oh shit,

34:21.620 --> 34:22.820
that's where the Overseer fucked up.

34:22.820 --> 34:24.220
Here we go, click.

34:24.220 --> 34:28.060
And part of your mind just fucking breaks in that moment.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.060
Roll sanity.

34:31.020 --> 34:36.020
As you analyze the Unnatural nature of the universe

34:38.080 --> 34:40.820
in which your mind currently exists.

34:40.820 --> 34:42.140
Do not pass.

34:42.180 --> 34:44.660
It's a 82 on a five.

34:45.580 --> 34:47.820
Lose one sanity.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.100
You know what that does, boy.

34:49.100 --> 34:50.300
Yeah, that's a breaking point.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.140
Showing up.

34:52.460 --> 34:54.240
So you're gonna lose one sanity

34:54.240 --> 34:58.620
as you handle this situation,

34:58.620 --> 35:00.200
and handle it you do,

35:00.200 --> 35:03.340
because the losing of the sanity is knowing

35:03.340 --> 35:06.740
that you are fucking in control now.

35:06.740 --> 35:10.220
You don't have a lot left of your humanity,

35:10.220 --> 35:15.220
but you're the most powerful fucker on the field, so.

35:17.100 --> 35:17.940
Dope.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.140
All right, go ahead and roll three D100 rolls, Joe,

35:22.140 --> 35:26.740
and holler what you roll.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.580
A 34.

35:31.220 --> 35:32.620
A 75.

35:36.380 --> 35:37.500
And a 12.

35:37.540 --> 35:42.340
34 is dermatillomania compulsion

35:42.340 --> 35:44.580
for picking at one's skin.

35:44.580 --> 35:45.900
Nasty.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.260
I could see ways to use that

35:47.260 --> 35:48.980
now that he's like split his body.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.340
Oh, God.

35:51.340 --> 35:56.340
75 is onomatomania irresistible desire

35:59.640 --> 36:01.740
to repeat certain words.

36:01.740 --> 36:03.460
Ooh, that's interesting.

36:03.460 --> 36:04.940
Now that I'm casting spells.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.100
Yep.

36:06.980 --> 36:08.940
And 12.

36:08.940 --> 36:13.940
12 is aminomania irrational cheerfulness.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.900
I love all three of these.

36:20.900 --> 36:21.940
Oh, shit.

36:21.940 --> 36:24.740
So aminomania is what I live with.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.760
I can role play that one real easy.

36:28.760 --> 36:29.620
I kind of want to do that.

36:29.620 --> 36:30.860
I kind of think it'd be funny for him

36:30.860 --> 36:32.380
to be the most optimistic person

36:32.380 --> 36:36.760
in this total hellscape of a grim scenario.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.620
I completely agree.

36:39.620 --> 36:40.460
Yeah, let's do it.

36:40.460 --> 36:41.300
Let's do that one.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.260
Aminomania.

36:42.260 --> 36:43.100
That's perfect.

36:43.100 --> 36:45.220
So Joe, what does Clark Bishop do

36:47.100 --> 36:52.100
to stave off the invasion of these falling bungee jumping

36:52.420 --> 36:56.700
frog into the frog tongue skeletons?

36:58.420 --> 36:59.740
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me.

36:59.740 --> 37:02.020
I know that the overseer was last seen.

37:02.540 --> 37:03.380
You said he extended his hand.

37:03.380 --> 37:05.420
So I think Clark's starting with that.

37:05.420 --> 37:07.540
He's got a big smile on his face

37:07.540 --> 37:08.500
because he's figured it out.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.340
He knows what's going on and it's all going to be fine.

37:11.340 --> 37:12.960
And he does it.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.800
I don't know.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.940
Did you picture some of these powers?

37:15.940 --> 37:16.860
How strong is this?

37:16.860 --> 37:20.180
Can they start shattering

37:20.180 --> 37:22.660
or are they just decommissioned shortly?

37:22.660 --> 37:24.220
You can do whatever you want.

37:24.220 --> 37:28.660
There's dripping skeletons that are coming down.

37:28.660 --> 37:29.620
He wants to shatter them.

37:30.020 --> 37:33.620
He wants them to pop as though those couple of myriads

37:33.620 --> 37:35.060
he did, but these are bones.

37:35.060 --> 37:38.300
So he knows that this is more of a break and less of a pop,

37:38.300 --> 37:40.300
but he wants them to shatter and crumble.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.860
Okay.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.460
Fucking cool.

37:43.460 --> 37:47.060
And let's go ahead and roll 2D12

37:47.060 --> 37:50.660
to see how many of these guys you can get.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.440
First one's a two.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.180
Uh-oh.

37:55.180 --> 37:58.580
Second one is a motherfucking one.

37:58.580 --> 37:59.540
I shit you not.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.780
Oh my God.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.100
I rolled a two and a one.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.860
Let's just pretend if we were rolling three,

38:04.860 --> 38:06.000
it would have been a 10.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.840
So.

38:06.840 --> 38:11.840
So three of these skeletons.

38:13.820 --> 38:14.900
God damn it.

38:14.900 --> 38:15.800
It makes sense.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.640
This was young Clark who shot the spell off.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.100
That's why it was only three.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.140
Yeah.

38:23.140 --> 38:24.700
He's just blossoming.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.180
He's just blooming.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.220
Figuring out his powers.

38:27.220 --> 38:29.060
He's going to get the hang of it.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.340
This is a good start.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.260
These things completely disintegrate

38:32.260 --> 38:35.180
and their bones as they turn into dust

38:35.180 --> 38:38.460
kind of meld with the residue that's around them.

38:38.460 --> 38:41.980
And it turns into like residue mud.

38:41.980 --> 38:45.780
It's like the liquid of the ooze and the muck

38:45.780 --> 38:48.980
with the sand now, like bone sand

38:48.980 --> 38:51.660
just kind of forms together in this.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.500
Gritty.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.720
Yeah.

38:53.720 --> 38:54.560
Yeah.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.380
He's there too.

38:55.380 --> 38:58.020
Is it like when you throw sand on diarrhea?

38:58.900 --> 38:59.740
Thomas.

39:02.820 --> 39:03.660
Yes.

39:03.660 --> 39:06.460
It's like throwing sand on diarrhea

39:06.460 --> 39:08.660
while holding up a newspaper from 10 years ago.

39:08.660 --> 39:12.820
And with that, the other skeletons are still coming down.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.840
Don D. Pettymore.

39:14.840 --> 39:15.820
It's your turn.

39:15.820 --> 39:20.500
You're in conversation with John Lee Pettymore III.

39:20.500 --> 39:24.660
He's given me a mild embrace with his tendrils.

39:24.660 --> 39:25.580
That's right.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.820
Just a pat on the back to reassure you.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.660
I kind of like grab it

39:29.660 --> 39:31.260
like you would like someone's hand

39:31.260 --> 39:33.660
and I'm like kind of like affectionately

39:33.660 --> 39:34.580
like grabbing it.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.420
Yeah, grabbing.

39:35.420 --> 39:36.580
Yeah, you're doing it.

39:36.580 --> 39:40.380
Like grabbing the hand on my, the hand,

39:40.380 --> 39:43.340
the metal tendril as though it was John's.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.540
Yeah, he's patting your shoulder

39:44.540 --> 39:45.620
with his metal tendrils

39:45.620 --> 39:47.780
and you put your hand on the metal tendrils

39:47.780 --> 39:49.260
and kind of pat back.

39:49.260 --> 39:51.220
Tell me what I need to do, John.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.580
Tell me what I can do to help make things right.

39:54.540 --> 39:58.260
You feel the tendril slip into your spine.

39:58.260 --> 39:59.380
Oh, shit.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.220
Yes.

40:06.580 --> 40:09.140
Oh, shit.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.780
And the ball comes out of John Lee Pettymore.

40:12.780 --> 40:15.140
He's kind of hanging limp

40:15.140 --> 40:17.780
and there's just a silver ball floating

40:17.780 --> 40:19.900
a few feet above him.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.860
And it all feels right though.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.060
As you feel more and more tendrils

40:25.060 --> 40:28.020
moving down your spine

40:28.020 --> 40:30.900
and experiencing your nerves

40:30.900 --> 40:34.260
and suddenly you and your nephew

40:34.260 --> 40:38.500
are kind of the same thing.

40:43.780 --> 40:45.100
Holy shit.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.940
Sorry.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.980
Did you take his spine out first?

40:49.980 --> 40:50.820
No, no, no.

40:50.820 --> 40:53.020
Just attach yourself to it.

40:53.020 --> 40:56.260
He's just been attached to the John of Fortune

40:56.260 --> 40:58.260
and he's part of that wheel of fate now.

40:59.660 --> 41:02.340
So we can also nix all that.

41:02.340 --> 41:06.340
I want Don to still be a character,

41:06.340 --> 41:08.580
but essentially he and John

41:08.580 --> 41:10.700
might just be talking heads.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.060
I don't want to take away all of John.

41:12.060 --> 41:13.300
I just literally took away

41:13.300 --> 41:15.460
all of Justin's character's agency,

41:15.460 --> 41:16.420
which we can.

41:17.420 --> 41:20.260
86 right off the bat.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.580
I just thought it might be wicked cool.

41:23.580 --> 41:24.500
Justin, how do you feel?

41:24.500 --> 41:25.340
Yeah, how do you feel, Justin?

41:25.340 --> 41:27.820
I don't mind at all about you taking away my agency.

41:27.820 --> 41:28.740
That's totally fine.

41:28.740 --> 41:33.380
I'm just curious of your motivation for wanting my body.

41:33.380 --> 41:35.380
Okay, that's what I don't know.

41:35.380 --> 41:36.620
That's what I don't know.

41:38.620 --> 41:41.020
But I kind of imagined John and Don

41:41.020 --> 41:43.580
as a second Nick and Mick

41:43.580 --> 41:45.340
and they're just heads.

41:45.340 --> 41:46.180
Oh no.

41:47.340 --> 41:48.380
That are literally like,

41:48.380 --> 41:50.700
okay, so imagine the tiny ball

41:50.700 --> 41:54.900
and then thick stocks of tendrils coming down

41:54.900 --> 41:59.220
forming essentially two legs with Don and John

41:59.220 --> 42:01.620
and it's just running around like an at-at.

42:02.780 --> 42:05.540
Oh my God, I love that so much

42:05.540 --> 42:07.100
and we'll see what comes of that.

42:07.100 --> 42:07.940
You look next to you

42:07.940 --> 42:11.780
and you see the body of John Lee Pettymore

42:11.780 --> 42:16.780
kind of hanging limply from this massive stock of tendrils

42:16.900 --> 42:19.860
that has started to come down from this very tiny ball

42:19.860 --> 42:22.900
and he kind of looks over at you expectantly

42:22.900 --> 42:25.020
and with a smile.

42:25.020 --> 42:29.380
He says, Don, I know in your life you were mostly an outlaw

42:29.380 --> 42:32.780
but I was a law man and that means I'm here to help.

42:32.780 --> 42:34.220
So that's what we're gonna do here today

42:34.220 --> 42:35.660
and I need your help with that

42:35.660 --> 42:38.380
which is why I've taken your body from you

42:38.380 --> 42:42.260
but I still respect your criminal mind.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.900
So I've left you that.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.620
You'll see here if you kind of look up

42:50.620 --> 42:53.460
and look around at what's going on here.

42:53.460 --> 42:56.060
I've taken over your central nervous system

42:56.060 --> 43:00.460
and now you're a part of a John and Don.

43:00.460 --> 43:02.140
It's kind of like an at-at.

43:02.140 --> 43:03.780
You like Star Wars, Uncle Don?

43:03.780 --> 43:05.640
Love Star Wars, boy.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.020
Where are the legs of a little,

43:07.020 --> 43:09.740
oh, I said at-at, it's actually an AT-ST.

43:09.740 --> 43:11.260
The scout trooper, right?

43:11.260 --> 43:12.900
What does AT-AT stand for?

43:12.900 --> 43:13.980
Attack, attack.

43:17.260 --> 43:19.020
The AT-STs are the small one.

43:19.020 --> 43:22.140
Yeah, AT-AT is the four legs, AT-ST is two.

43:22.140 --> 43:24.260
Scout transport.

43:24.260 --> 43:25.980
Listen, Uncle Don.

43:25.980 --> 43:30.020
What we are is a swift, highly mobile ball

43:30.020 --> 43:34.260
with the minds of two wily Pettymores, chicken walker.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.260
We're gonna get out there on that battlefield

43:37.260 --> 43:41.100
and we're gonna be where we're needed and help who we can.

43:41.100 --> 43:42.740
Does that sound amenable to you?

43:42.740 --> 43:46.060
Don has like kind of like tears running down his eyes

43:46.060 --> 43:48.160
when this starts happening,

43:48.160 --> 43:52.260
as he's like finally able to like let go of all the stress

43:52.260 --> 43:53.960
now that he's no longer in control.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.800
And he's like, it sounds wonderful.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.740
Fuck yeah.

43:59.740 --> 44:02.580
John's head like gives a little nod

44:02.620 --> 44:06.020
and then you get wicked whiplash

44:06.020 --> 44:09.440
as this thing runs off towards the skeletons.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.700
Real fast, will you describe the image of it

44:15.700 --> 44:17.020
one more time for me?

44:17.020 --> 44:18.100
What's the setup?

44:18.100 --> 44:23.100
Imagine, imagine a tiny ball with the legs of an AT-ST.

44:24.380 --> 44:25.860
So these tendrils have come out

44:25.860 --> 44:30.860
and they formed into thick, powerful leg trunks.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.700
Like you might find on an AT-ST

44:34.700 --> 44:38.740
and where their shins and feet would be,

44:38.740 --> 44:42.200
that's the, those are the bodies of John and Don

44:42.200 --> 44:45.380
with their heads at like the kneecaps.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.300
Gotcha, gotcha.

44:47.300 --> 44:49.940
They're like Pacific Rim mind melded together.

44:49.940 --> 44:53.740
Yeah, they're kind of just like crucified on this thing.

44:53.740 --> 44:55.380
Yeah, but they look cheerful.

44:55.380 --> 44:56.980
Crying kneecaps.

44:56.980 --> 45:00.360
Yeah, cheerfully, cheerfully crying kneecap.

45:01.060 --> 45:02.060
Don Deep anymore.

45:04.220 --> 45:05.060
This is great.

45:05.060 --> 45:09.420
Okay, that was Don's turn somehow.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.340
Great turn, great turn.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.840
Good job, good job.

45:20.860 --> 45:21.940
That's good.

45:21.940 --> 45:26.700
It is John's turn and it is not this ball John's turn,

45:26.700 --> 45:30.820
but rather it is the ball John that has been repelled

45:31.780 --> 45:36.580
like a magnet away from the ball of Rosemary, M-A-R-Y.

45:36.580 --> 45:39.520
Basically John Ball is taken aback

45:39.520 --> 45:43.440
by being repulsed from Ballmary.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.340
He's floating there for a second

45:47.220 --> 45:50.220
and then he sees her starting to open like the portal.

45:50.220 --> 45:51.120
Starting.

45:52.300 --> 45:53.880
He sees her starting to open the portal

45:53.880 --> 45:57.920
and very quickly long spindly like tendrils

45:57.920 --> 45:59.760
shoot out of him.

45:59.760 --> 46:02.760
He's trying to move the material of the world back,

46:02.760 --> 46:05.120
like fill it back in where she's opening the portal.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.120
Nice, hell yeah.

46:07.120 --> 46:07.960
I dig it.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.920
It's frantically like a kid in a sandbox.

46:09.920 --> 46:13.360
He's just like trying to scoop the world into her hole.

46:14.640 --> 46:15.480
Yeah.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.280
Like a kid in a sandbox.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.040
Yeah.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.360
All right.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.560
She just failed her unnatural role

46:28.560 --> 46:32.220
and so if you can pass yours, then this happens.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.000
43 on a 67.

46:38.000 --> 46:38.840
Well done.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.480
Moving on.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.360
I pour the world into her hole.

46:51.360 --> 46:55.520
Yeah, and now it is the Sky Sea Keith.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.720
Keith has just

46:59.280 --> 47:02.160
filled up a worm's mouth

47:03.840 --> 47:08.240
with this liquid nitrogen, this frozen material

47:08.240 --> 47:12.440
completely creating an ice luge

47:12.440 --> 47:15.720
like a water slide down there at Splashylvania

47:15.720 --> 47:19.440
but in winter time as if the entire encasement tube

47:19.480 --> 47:23.840
has been frozen and feet first he goes right on in there

47:23.840 --> 47:25.600
and Keith, let me tell you,

47:25.600 --> 47:29.840
the things that you see blow your fucking mind

47:29.840 --> 47:34.680
because you are now just surrounded in this ice world.

47:34.680 --> 47:37.080
It is cold as fuck in here

47:37.080 --> 47:42.080
and you see almost like a translucent ice barrier

47:42.400 --> 47:44.920
surrounding you all around you

47:44.920 --> 47:49.280
and on the other side of it are just dazzling shapes

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
and colors, large shadows, just all of these movements

47:55.920 --> 48:00.440
like you're at an aquarium, like a psychedelic aquarium

48:00.440 --> 48:04.600
but the entire pane of glass has been frosted over.

48:04.600 --> 48:09.480
How big am I like, what am I trying to ask?

48:09.480 --> 48:10.840
You've got elbow room.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.800
Okay, I'm not like completely sucked in

48:13.800 --> 48:16.520
like to the esophagus or whatever.

48:16.520 --> 48:18.080
You got two elbows room.

48:18.080 --> 48:20.160
Two elbows room, okay, tight.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.880
Keith looks around and he's amazed.

48:24.880 --> 48:26.400
He's kind of like entranced

48:26.400 --> 48:28.400
and he's just kind of staring off

48:28.400 --> 48:31.320
and looking at the shapes and the shadows and everything

48:31.320 --> 48:35.720
and then he snaps out of it and he remembers why he's here

48:35.720 --> 48:38.840
and he tries to just punch through,

48:38.840 --> 48:43.840
basically punch his way out of this frozen worm's stomach

48:44.040 --> 48:47.000
or whatever part of the body I'm in.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.400
Sure, yeah, go ahead and roll.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.840
Okay, it's a 36.

48:51.840 --> 48:55.120
I feel like that's gonna be good, but let's find out.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.000
What?

48:56.000 --> 48:59.440
40%, so I pass with 36.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.360
Excellent. Nice.

49:01.360 --> 49:05.400
Also, remember I have these pneumatic arm things too

49:05.400 --> 49:08.440
so my punch is extra strong.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.120
Yes, and with that, you are going to be able

49:13.120 --> 49:16.040
to shatter this worm from the inside.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.160
As this thing shatters,

49:18.160 --> 49:22.240
cold water begins pouring in all around you.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.680
You swim up to the top.

49:24.680 --> 49:28.080
You can grab onto one of these frozen insides,

49:28.080 --> 49:32.040
pieces of this thing to kind of raft you,

49:32.040 --> 49:34.680
help you hold on to the top of this water

49:34.680 --> 49:38.200
as waves are unnaturally coming at you from left, right,

49:38.200 --> 49:39.600
from front, from back.

49:39.600 --> 49:40.760
They're going past you.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.160
They're coming from within you.

49:42.160 --> 49:46.080
Like it's just, the water is not reacting like normal water

49:46.080 --> 49:47.520
and as you're looking up over the top

49:47.520 --> 49:49.080
of any of these cresting waves,

49:49.080 --> 49:53.960
you see worm after worm coming up, diving back in.

49:53.960 --> 49:56.920
You look down, you can't see anything.

49:56.920 --> 49:57.960
You can't see your body.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.880
You can't see your feet.

49:58.880 --> 50:02.080
The water is completely dark and looking above you,

50:03.120 --> 50:07.080
your sky is a luminous ground

50:07.080 --> 50:10.760
that this fight is being fought on

50:10.760 --> 50:12.960
and that is your ceiling.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.240
How many worms are there?

50:14.240 --> 50:16.080
I was under the impression there were two,

50:16.080 --> 50:19.080
but are there just a bunch swimming around in here?

50:19.080 --> 50:20.560
Yeah, there's more than two.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.000
Well, that's not good.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.040
Why did you think there was two?

50:27.120 --> 50:27.960
I don't know.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.240
I thought there were just two for some reason.

50:30.240 --> 50:31.840
And Keith immediately thinks to himself,

50:31.840 --> 50:34.960
fuck, I should not have done this.

50:34.960 --> 50:38.320
That's exactly what Keith thinks.

50:38.320 --> 50:43.320
Yeah, he finds a door-sized frozen piece of worm

50:45.040 --> 50:47.880
and he climbs on top of it and he looks

50:47.880 --> 50:51.840
and he sees a worm come up like a dolphin would

50:51.840 --> 50:52.680
or something.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.520
It winks at you.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.960
And it winks at me and Keith thinks,

51:02.600 --> 51:05.160
I'm gonna have to do a lot of this.

51:05.160 --> 51:08.720
And he lunges at the worm that's near him.

51:09.760 --> 51:10.600
Hell yeah.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.560
From on top of the frozen piece of worm.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.640
That's so bad ass.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.320
Also, I'm glad you're up in the sky,

51:19.320 --> 51:20.920
but now it makes a lot more sense

51:20.920 --> 51:23.080
why you went there if you thought like,

51:23.080 --> 51:24.760
after you got to that first worm,

51:24.760 --> 51:27.160
like halfway done, there's only one more.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.680
Upon realizing his mistake,

51:30.680 --> 51:32.800
Keith is like, well, I'm here anyway,

51:32.840 --> 51:35.520
so might as well just get to it.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.960
Hell yeah.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.080
Doers get it done.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.280
Planet Juggernaut.

51:41.280 --> 51:46.280
Planet Juggernaut had been eerily still last turn

51:46.560 --> 51:48.520
and you heard whirring inside of him.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.080
How many turns did that take?

51:50.080 --> 51:51.080
One.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.400
Oh, cool.

51:52.400 --> 51:55.360
Planet Juggernaut starts rolling

51:55.360 --> 51:57.080
almost imperceptibly at first,

51:57.080 --> 52:00.440
but then it's faster than you can really imagine.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.800
And he's heading towards those fucking skeletons

52:03.800 --> 52:05.240
like they're bowling pins.

52:06.120 --> 52:06.960
Yeah.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.240
They're coming down from the sky

52:09.240 --> 52:10.640
and Planet Juggernaut,

52:11.960 --> 52:14.360
I mean, this thing is spinning, spinning, spinning,

52:14.360 --> 52:15.200
spinning, spinning,

52:15.200 --> 52:17.840
and then all of a sudden it launches itself

52:17.840 --> 52:20.640
up into the air and is going to take out

52:20.640 --> 52:24.800
and fitting their nine bowling pin skeletons

52:24.800 --> 52:25.680
left in the air,

52:25.680 --> 52:26.880
which is how many are left

52:26.880 --> 52:29.480
after I have thrown one bowling ball.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.200
Cause it's like I only hit one.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.040
Yeah.

52:34.040 --> 52:35.520
It's wild that you can only hit one

52:35.520 --> 52:37.040
with the bumpers even.

52:40.320 --> 52:42.440
Yeah, we put the bumpers on and played golf rules.

52:42.440 --> 52:43.720
Exactly, lowest score.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.320
That actually sounds really game.

52:47.320 --> 52:49.080
Yeah, that sounds doable.

52:49.080 --> 52:50.480
It sounds like you created something here

52:50.480 --> 52:51.760
that we got to give a try.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.320
Don't put this episode out.

52:54.320 --> 52:55.560
We got to patent this.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.400
Yeah.

52:57.400 --> 53:00.720
Bowling golf is going to make us a million bucks.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.680
It's going to be huge.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.360
From the creators of the fuck barrel.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.680
Yeah, what's your company do?

53:06.680 --> 53:08.840
Oh, we're a podcast company

53:08.840 --> 53:09.680
who makes the fuck barrel.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.800
We're a multimedia conglomerate

53:11.800 --> 53:15.640
that puts out some audio entertainment,

53:16.560 --> 53:18.760
at home leisure projects,

53:18.760 --> 53:21.960
and we also run a professional sporting enterprise.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.080
At home leisure projects.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.000
Products, you know.

53:28.000 --> 53:28.840
Products.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.680
Personal.

53:29.680 --> 53:30.640
Roll bowling.

53:30.640 --> 53:31.800
Look on your foot sheet.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.120
Should I just roll a D10?

53:33.120 --> 53:35.240
No, go ahead and roll two D12.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.080
Two D12.

53:37.320 --> 53:39.800
It's the one that looks like a D20, but isn't.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.400
I had to remind myself when I was searching for it.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.080
Okay.

53:47.240 --> 53:49.040
15 and 11 and a four.

53:49.040 --> 53:50.360
Do you know what that'll do?

53:50.360 --> 53:51.840
Take out all nine skeletons?

53:51.840 --> 53:53.160
That'll take out all nine skeletons.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.000
Hell yeah.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.320
Can I describe what happens?

53:58.320 --> 54:01.240
Can you leave one so that I can describe how cool it is

54:01.240 --> 54:02.920
when it grabs Drew Andrews

54:02.920 --> 54:06.000
and rips him back into the mouth of a giantum rapithecus?

54:06.000 --> 54:07.080
Yeah, you can leave one.

54:07.080 --> 54:07.920
That's fine.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.240
No.

54:09.240 --> 54:12.200
No, you're not going to do that to our baby boy.

54:12.200 --> 54:13.040
Would have been cool.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.360
Would have been the body of Drew or Drew?

54:14.360 --> 54:18.240
Oh, when you say Drew Andrews, you mean Drew pages?

54:18.240 --> 54:20.040
I mean, when I say Drew Andrews,

54:20.040 --> 54:22.320
I mean the body of Councilwoman Kerry pages,

54:22.320 --> 54:25.800
but yeah, let's move on to a description from Thomas

54:26.400 --> 54:27.240
about how fucking cool this is.

54:27.240 --> 54:28.080
Right.

54:28.080 --> 54:31.200
So you mentioned that they're flying down from the air.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.800
So Planet Juggernaut has flown up to meet him,

54:34.800 --> 54:37.720
almost like he hit a ridge in the world

54:37.720 --> 54:39.280
as he was rolling or something.

54:39.280 --> 54:43.440
And maybe you even see one appear before him just briefly,

54:43.440 --> 54:44.640
but you can't be sure.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.320
Something strange happens.

54:46.320 --> 54:49.040
As Planet Juggernaut is rising up into the air,

54:49.040 --> 54:51.360
heading towards these skeletons,

54:51.360 --> 54:55.200
he kind of blocks your view of them for a second.

54:55.480 --> 54:57.280
He rises up to where they were.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.160
And as you come down,

54:59.160 --> 55:03.840
you see just like a string of ichor shooting back up

55:03.840 --> 55:05.360
into this thing's mouth.

55:05.360 --> 55:07.240
And where Planet Juggernaut hits the ground

55:07.240 --> 55:09.040
and starts rolling again,

55:09.040 --> 55:13.880
you see like black chewing gum just stuck to the side

55:15.920 --> 55:17.760
of his like chassis.

55:17.760 --> 55:21.440
And you see like some rib cages and shit sticking out.

55:22.280 --> 55:25.560
But these things are just like completely waffled on him.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.960
This is how it feels to chew five gum.

55:33.240 --> 55:36.320
And because you rolled so high above the nine,

55:37.480 --> 55:41.920
think about an AT-AT and think about Luke Skywalker

55:41.920 --> 55:44.760
and think about this Gigantumbropithecus

55:44.760 --> 55:46.920
and think about how you've got its tongue.

55:46.920 --> 55:49.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.080
Those are Joe's vinegar strokes.

55:59.360 --> 56:02.120
So Planet Juggernaut, as his turn ends,

56:02.120 --> 56:05.200
you just see him starting to take a long, graceful turn

56:05.200 --> 56:07.720
around the feet of the Gigantumbropithecus.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.400
Yes.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.240
Awesome.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.080
Yes.

56:12.760 --> 56:17.280
Oh, and as Planet Juggernaut picks up that spare,

56:17.280 --> 56:21.440
we've gone through another round of combat here, Nick Nichols.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.920
That's absolutely amazing.

56:22.920 --> 56:25.880
I think we owe our lives to our one true god,

56:25.880 --> 56:27.200
Planet Juggernaut.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.880
Praise be to the Juggernaut.

56:28.880 --> 56:30.560
Praise be to the Juggernaut.

56:30.560 --> 56:32.000
Now, did you think, Nick,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.600
that it was going to be one episode

56:34.600 --> 56:36.640
per one round of combat here?

56:37.560 --> 56:41.120
You know, I wanted to say no, but that's just it.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.680
It happened.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.000
We had all hoped not.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.080
What I specifically hated about D&D

56:50.080 --> 56:54.280
was waiting for everyone else to take their turn forever.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.920
And instead, I just took three 30-minute turns this game.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.560
One of which was Justin's.

57:04.560 --> 57:07.400
Right?

57:34.560 --> 57:43.560
What kind of world are you living in?

57:43.560 --> 57:53.560
What kind of world are you living in?

57:53.560 --> 58:03.560
What kind of world are you living in?

58:03.560 --> 58:11.560
What kind of world are you living in?

58:11.560 --> 58:19.560
What kind of world are you living in?
