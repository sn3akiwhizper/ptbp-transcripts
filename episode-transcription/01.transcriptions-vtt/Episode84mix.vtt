Y'all ever tasted sour cream and thought to yourself

02:16.620 --> 02:22.820
The amount of sour in this cream is not nearly enough for one such as I so

02:23.180 --> 02:27.460
You let it sit in the jar outside for a few days now

02:27.460 --> 02:33.100
That's some sour shit and a little chunky, you know old wolf loves his crystals

02:33.100 --> 02:36.300
But in the words of the Queen Jada essence hall

02:37.140 --> 02:40.380
Misdirection herself look over there. It's the news

02:41.260 --> 02:47.780
Last time lots of information was shared and then Keith went berserk on little old

02:48.220 --> 02:53.700
Mildred Mitchell John kicked things off by telling the group about his uncle

02:53.700 --> 02:57.980
Don D. Pettymore who could burn folks with his hands

02:58.020 --> 03:02.300
John also recalled being chased by two tall gaunt

03:02.540 --> 03:10.140
Fancy men in suits while being pushed in a wheelchair by Uncle Don Keith also remembered seeing those lemmy

03:10.860 --> 03:16.620
Translucent fellas infiltrate his father's estate the day Ferguson was given the watch

03:17.060 --> 03:24.220
John put the watch on and saw his daddy steal him the vector and adopted baby from the Kane

03:24.540 --> 03:26.500
Family burning down their house

03:26.500 --> 03:33.460
But unaware of Adam Kane's survival Keith slapped the watch on and saw John murder him and

03:33.660 --> 03:38.340
Clark in order to take the watch and walk down into beans pond

03:38.660 --> 03:44.900
But the watch didn't come off his wrist when he came back to reality and he became real

03:45.540 --> 03:47.060
suspicious of John

03:47.060 --> 03:53.260
Shit got heated with Mildred Mitchell blaming the three PCs for her granddaughter Tilly B's

03:53.820 --> 03:56.900
Disappearance showed them a picture of the founders of

03:57.460 --> 04:02.920
contention the face of Silas Cole had settled on the face of Keith Vigna and a

04:03.100 --> 04:09.900
Reflection in the glass looked a whole lot like that miss until DB Keith lost it and Keith did up

04:10.340 --> 04:15.300
Grinding the old stoner into the old stone ground. This was a step too far

04:15.820 --> 04:22.980
Harry and Gary asked them to leave at gunpoint and the three headed south into a tunnel and toward

04:23.300 --> 04:24.500
beanspond

04:24.500 --> 04:25.460
Never mind

04:25.460 --> 04:32.620
They completely ignored the spell that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's back pocket as well as the fact that Casey

04:32.980 --> 04:38.700
Kristoff the longtime janitor of the first Church of contention was clearly

04:39.340 --> 04:46.620
Eavesdropping instead of reading his book. It'd be a shame if old Casey wasn't actually down there in the sewers to avoid

04:47.380 --> 04:50.060
Big Daddy Kane, but rather doing

04:50.660 --> 04:56.880
Reconnaissance for his employer. Well, what do I know? I'm just here to deliver you a brand new song

04:57.460 --> 05:03.040
premiering shit non-stop every week or day or a few hours or like

05:03.260 --> 05:05.680
25 minutes in game time or even sometimes

05:06.380 --> 05:10.060
In the past and hopefully in season 2 or whatever

05:10.540 --> 05:15.860
This one's new when it's just for you. It's kazoo with no backbone

05:21.060 --> 05:23.060
You

05:46.100 --> 05:48.640
Thanks for having me yeah problem Joe, yeah

05:48.640 --> 05:52.600
Thanks for having all of us Luke. I understand you've been playing Crusader Kings. I have

05:53.720 --> 05:58.880
Zach your couch is pretty comfy and Ramona is sleeping on top of the other one and she's very cute

05:59.080 --> 06:03.920
Luke's internet hasn't been working. So we're using lots of hand sanitizer and

06:05.360 --> 06:08.640
Keeping him just in the living room. Yep

06:09.720 --> 06:11.160
I'm here

06:11.160 --> 06:16.640
Ramona likes the smell of the germ X she likes to I was petting her but she kept wanting to lick my hands

06:17.160 --> 06:24.020
Well, don't let my cat lick the poison off of your she does she's not gonna have any germs in her mouth by the end of

06:24.020 --> 06:26.020
the night

06:26.840 --> 06:33.480
Zach the president implied that things like this are not only fine, but beneficial. So oh well

06:33.480 --> 06:38.420
Oh God, he also said if we stop testing the numbers will be very low

06:40.480 --> 06:44.440
Which is true. Yeah, it's been proven, correct

06:47.040 --> 06:51.480
Yep, welcome to hell world fuckheads. Oh

06:54.400 --> 07:00.840
You thought you were gonna get away from the world by listening to a role-playing podcast we've all been touched by the devil hands

07:06.200 --> 07:08.440
Don D. Petty more patient zero

07:09.600 --> 07:13.480
God-dang Don D. Don D. I wonder when he'll show up

07:14.160 --> 07:19.620
Yeah, so much happened last episode that I kind of forgot that that's where we started was a man who could burn other people with

07:19.620 --> 07:21.620
his bare hands I

07:22.660 --> 07:25.960
Thomas and I hadn't talked about the past of that and

07:26.680 --> 07:32.220
Hearing that it was just a staple in their childhood camping trips was pretty horrifying to hear

07:33.960 --> 07:40.600
It's like I'm trying to think of like anything my family or like like a weird trick and uncle can do or something

07:40.600 --> 07:46.200
But nothing really matches. Yeah, my uncle can pull his thumb clean off. He puts it right back

07:47.000 --> 07:53.200
My uncle that's so on multiple occasions has stolen my nose off of my face

07:53.200 --> 07:58.300
Oh shit, but it's he always puts it back sometimes not right away, which is scary, but

08:00.800 --> 08:04.880
He lost it one time we had to look all around it was in the couch

08:05.600 --> 08:07.080
Yeah

08:07.080 --> 08:08.120
uncle

08:08.120 --> 08:13.880
Dave all uncles are Dave all uncles are Dave. I have one uncle Dave. I have an uncle Dave

08:13.880 --> 08:19.560
I have an uncle Dave. Really? I have two uncles named Dave. You got a Jimmy and I got a Jimmy

08:19.560 --> 08:21.920
So maybe they're all Jimmy. Oh, I've got a Jimmy to

08:22.560 --> 08:27.000
Story. Yeah, me too. My uncle Donny's name is Jimmy now. I

08:28.480 --> 08:32.160
Renamed Dave who didn't exist in the first place. Welcome to 84

08:32.600 --> 08:39.800
Pretending to be people where everybody's uncle has a name. Wait, how many uncles do you have just on your dad's side?

08:43.720 --> 08:45.720
Six and how many else

08:46.440 --> 08:51.480
Yeah, I just won wait, but they all live together. Yeah. No, they did it one point

08:51.680 --> 08:56.640
They actually didn't their ages were so like the oldest to the youngest I think is an 18 year difference

08:56.800 --> 09:00.240
So they'd weren't ever in the house all at the same time. I don't think oh

09:00.240 --> 09:05.480
Can you imagine getting rid of one and then there's just a new one all the sudden there about yeah

09:05.480 --> 09:10.240
Their numbers didn't change at all. Definitely after the first one like grew up a little bit

09:10.240 --> 09:13.760
They were like, oh shit. These things are handy if you teach them how to like

09:17.480 --> 09:22.920
18 years of like fresh kids definitely seems like some kind of forced labor program or like

09:24.120 --> 09:26.120
Something they were getting out of it

09:26.800 --> 09:30.200
Not joy or love you can get that one, too

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
How do ants get made

09:40.520 --> 09:42.520
In pursuit of an ant

09:43.340 --> 09:49.460
Wait wouldn't if your uncle fucked your grandma you would get you get you get a grant grandpa

09:49.520 --> 09:53.160
Well, no, we only discuss you get another you get an aunt you get an aunt

09:54.000 --> 09:57.640
If your uncle fucked your grandpa then you'd get another mom

09:58.720 --> 10:00.720
All right, you you would get another

10:01.600 --> 10:04.500
Grandma, cuz if you fuck your dad you get a mom

10:04.800 --> 10:10.280
So if your uncle fucked your grandpa by the trans you would get a grandma another grandma

10:10.280 --> 10:14.600
I was never good at biology in school. So I don't know if this really checks out. It's like

10:15.480 --> 10:20.400
And recessive jeans and stuff. Yeah, you have to look at the Punnett Square. Yeah

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
Invented by

10:24.360 --> 10:26.360
Who's who is that guy

10:30.280 --> 10:35.300
Recessive gene and a dominant gene and Taylor has two recessive genes

10:35.640 --> 10:38.920
Then when we have sex, we'll get a great-grandma

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
correct

10:42.640 --> 10:44.640
What was that now I got to figure out

10:45.520 --> 10:51.320
Who's the guy that figured that out his name was something he was like a monk or a priest or something

10:51.320 --> 10:58.240
I bet Thomas will be upset that you had to google it. What who discovered recessive genes Thomas was it Mendel?

10:58.240 --> 11:05.700
Yep, Gregory. Yeah, Mendel men who actually I don't know if you guys knew this same guy is Rasputin people

11:05.700 --> 11:09.320
Don't know that but he's the same guy. It's the exact same guy

11:09.320 --> 11:12.600
Yeah, he just went by Gregory when he was doing science

11:16.840 --> 11:23.920
Close enough for me. Have you guys been watching the great on Hulu never heard of it? No, I hear it's good though

11:23.920 --> 11:27.960
It's really good. It's it's the guy who did the or the people who did the favorite?

11:27.960 --> 11:33.080
So it's a lot of that movie rule same sense of humor style, and I don't know what the favorite is

11:33.840 --> 11:40.120
Who knows your guys Lanthimos is last movie with oh I did see that that was really good. Yeah, Emma Stone and

11:40.800 --> 11:44.040
Holly Coleman leak Peaky Blinders. Yeah, I'll be sure

11:44.800 --> 11:47.040
Paulie Shore and Nicholas Holt

11:47.880 --> 11:52.800
So Nicholas Holt is that there's one of the main characters in the in the great and he's fucking great in it

11:52.960 --> 11:59.420
It's a really surprisingly. So I was a big skins UK fan when I was it. Oh, is that

12:00.300 --> 12:04.620
What's the code Tony Tony stolen yes season one Tony

12:05.100 --> 12:13.220
Alright, so Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore the third they're walking down this tunnel having just been essentially forced out of this room

12:13.300 --> 12:17.500
By the only two people you've been able to trust and contention thus far

12:18.020 --> 12:25.260
Essentially, yeah, that didn't feel too good you catch up and you see Keith Vigna on the right side of this tunnel again

12:25.260 --> 12:27.260
This is an arched

12:27.340 --> 12:34.180
Very Ninja Turtles arched roof above you with a pathway on the right pathway on the left and then sewage sludge

12:34.820 --> 12:38.420
Slowly moving in the middle. You see me on the right side

12:38.420 --> 12:45.980
I'm on my back and I've got my left hand that has the watch on it and I've got both my feet on

12:46.560 --> 12:51.460
my arm just trying to like pry the watch off my wrist and

12:52.020 --> 12:56.980
I'm crying and he's crying because you can see the scrape of skin coming off

12:57.260 --> 13:01.140
and blood and I'm also he's also crying cuz he

13:02.060 --> 13:07.580
Potentially just killed someone Keith Keith Keith Keith calm down buddy. Hold on

13:07.580 --> 13:12.560
No, I got this is just fucking I know we got to get it off, but that's not working. Look at that

13:12.560 --> 13:17.300
That's not like you're hurting yourself there Keith. It hurts. It does. I just we're gonna get it off

13:17.660 --> 13:19.740
We're gonna get it off. Was she was she?

13:19.740 --> 13:21.740
I

13:21.740 --> 13:26.020
Still breathing when we left Keith, okay. Can you are you sure?

13:26.820 --> 13:28.620
Yeah, we're sure

13:28.620 --> 13:29.820
Why?

13:29.820 --> 13:31.820
Why did you do that? I?

13:32.740 --> 13:37.700
Don't know. I thought maybe she had something to do with this being stuck on it

13:37.700 --> 13:44.180
I don't I just don't think straight when shit like this happens anymore. I can understand that

13:44.660 --> 13:48.300
Think things will set us off at the drop of a hat these days. It seems like

13:48.980 --> 13:53.440
We've seen a lot. We've seen a lot in the last few days on are you still gonna shoot us when we get there?

13:53.960 --> 13:57.460
Maybe man, I don't know. I got two guns now, though

13:58.820 --> 14:05.680
Okay, listen, all I'm saying is you you do some crazy shit you attack, you know an old lady that we find there

14:06.180 --> 14:08.940
yeah, maybe I'm gonna have to shoot you but if you fucking just

14:09.700 --> 14:15.540
Okay, well maybe you can you walk in front me and Clark can walk behind you just to make me feel better

14:16.260 --> 14:21.260
Absolutely. Are we I don't even know if we're going the right way. I I get in front of them

14:21.260 --> 14:23.260
But then I turn around with gun strong

14:26.540 --> 14:30.900
Just what just playing just plants that's not very funny John a people

14:30.900 --> 14:35.260
He's got you know, it's a tense situation. Somebody's got to diffuse it a little bit

14:35.620 --> 14:41.900
So I've livened things up get get get a little get a little joy in our heart after you beat that old woman half to

14:41.900 --> 14:43.900
death fucking psychopath

14:44.700 --> 14:49.940
It wasn't really me. It was I don't know something in me. Just I

14:50.740 --> 14:53.340
Didn't I didn't want to do it. I didn't mean to but

14:54.940 --> 14:57.360
Let's just get let's just get to the fucking pond

14:57.860 --> 15:02.580
Gary said we were we were heading in the right direction you that you happen to pick the right tunnel to to crawl

15:02.580 --> 15:06.900
Good it's probably cuz I'm the Savior and I just have that kind of intuition now

15:08.620 --> 15:12.020
Sure, all right, I pet you on the back I roll my eyes at Clark

15:12.020 --> 15:15.620
Yeah, I roll I roll back as I'm patting you on the back. Yeah, that's it

15:16.260 --> 15:18.260
You nailed it

15:19.060 --> 15:20.260
Yes

15:20.260 --> 15:24.760
Would while we're walking there would this be a good time to discuss something?

15:24.760 --> 15:27.860
we haven't really talked a whole lot about we found out that we

15:28.380 --> 15:30.380
You know kind of

15:31.380 --> 15:33.380
Maybe from one point of view

15:33.580 --> 15:35.580
from a certain perspective

15:35.860 --> 15:40.820
Might have let Adam Cain's wife and his children burn to a little crisp in a minivan

15:40.820 --> 15:45.260
I mean we we just ran that help we tried to help

15:45.260 --> 15:49.620
I know but it doesn't seem like people think we did it seems like they really think we just

15:50.260 --> 15:56.080
Let them burn up and then we left town. We can a Adam Cain you what you're technically his

15:57.080 --> 16:02.720
A kind of his brother. Yeah, we've now learned that his entire family was killed and he was a sole survivor

16:03.640 --> 16:05.640
because of Kevin's slobiness

16:06.040 --> 16:10.840
Or perhaps ill ill got it. Sorry Murphy's going crazy. So good. Gotta stop him

16:10.840 --> 16:13.400
You can hear Tyler from back the way you came

16:14.120 --> 16:16.040
yelping out

16:16.040 --> 16:20.600
Tyler did like us Keith hops in the sewage and starts splashing around

16:23.240 --> 16:25.360
Keith roll Constitution

16:27.080 --> 16:29.080
To not get gonorrhea

16:29.160 --> 16:35.960
No, what do you get from from poop? Maybe like E. Coli or pink eye pink eye or

16:36.800 --> 16:42.200
What's something else you can get what happens if you eat poop Thomas? What happens if you eat poop?

16:42.200 --> 16:49.360
I think that depends on the poop a lot of people do ingest other people's poop to improve their gut biome

16:49.360 --> 16:54.640
Oh, I thought they shot it up their butts like a like a like a tall boy. They make little poop pills

16:54.720 --> 16:59.600
No way according to Illinois Poison Center eating poop is minimally toxic

17:01.440 --> 17:03.440
So I think

17:03.760 --> 17:08.920
You should eat poop. That's also is that core prophagia, huh? Is that what it's called?

17:08.920 --> 17:13.400
It was enough syllables to be right co prophagia. Let's get back to the convert

17:13.400 --> 17:20.520
What were we talking about out of character when John you were telling us the story the the canes also adopted you, right?

17:20.520 --> 17:26.360
Like right I had been a yeah, it's so first exactly and Kevin stole me because

17:26.920 --> 17:31.320
He and my my my saintly mother were trying to have a baby and could not conceive

17:32.200 --> 17:38.320
Gotcha, and so God saw fit to put me a child of destiny and ball in front of him

17:38.960 --> 17:43.680
Because I am the Savior we did we did try to save Adams family in that wreck

17:43.680 --> 17:48.720
I obviously didn't go to according to plan but we tried and there was a crowd around there that saw us trying to help

17:48.760 --> 17:53.720
I think John you might have scared him off with a couple gunshots, but they saw that we were helping I

17:54.600 --> 17:55.880
Don't think that's you know

17:55.880 --> 18:03.120
Cuz the the person we've been around who's been close to Adam was was Carrie in the body of Drew and the story

18:03.120 --> 18:10.480
She told us seems like Adam Kane and the town's version of things right now is that we let them die and then left town

18:10.880 --> 18:18.280
Yeah, that's sucks for him that he's lost two families in a horrible horrific fire

18:18.720 --> 18:19.640
accident

18:19.640 --> 18:25.960
Well, maybe not accident for the first it certainly adds a layer of terror to that memories. Yeah

18:26.600 --> 18:29.460
guys, I tried my hardest to keep it from happening, but

18:33.680 --> 18:36.360
Well also so we've

18:40.760 --> 18:47.760
Valiantly if I remember guys, we've also all had have we all had encounters with those crazy

18:48.560 --> 18:51.720
Creatures before I mean Marvin things

18:51.720 --> 18:56.200
I I mean like I told you guys before I got this watch stuck on me that I

18:56.520 --> 18:59.240
Saw three of them at least when I was a kid

18:59.680 --> 19:05.620
In my in my yard before before my dad gave this watch to my brother in my memory

19:05.620 --> 19:12.700
It was a they were chasing the I I would say a rogue figure but these days it's the road figure

19:12.700 --> 19:16.080
I think it's the same one. We've been seeing it might be old me

19:16.080 --> 19:22.000
I think it's old me that people seem to think it's old bar called Clark old and they were chasing you after your after your

19:22.120 --> 19:28.600
Accident John. Well, yeah that the last day of my racing career is kind of one big concussed blur

19:29.200 --> 19:32.720
But as far as I remember it, yeah

19:32.720 --> 19:40.520
They started chasing me and Don D that day these things have known something about us long before we ever did

19:40.560 --> 19:45.280
Yeah, maybe so they were they were targeting each of us and mine was I was only

19:45.800 --> 19:48.840
Forwarded by old me. He put chains around the library door

19:48.840 --> 19:54.040
That's where I was in the library and he put chains around the door and then took maybe he took the heat off of Mary

19:58.240 --> 20:01.920
On the front it says the Mary Cole Public Library

20:10.960 --> 20:16.000
It it seems like the yeah those those men those those those creatures in suits

20:16.000 --> 20:20.480
They were after after each of us and it sounds like I gotta have Justin change the map

20:23.120 --> 20:24.960
Well shit I

20:24.960 --> 20:28.400
How all this is just all the shits happened so fast

20:28.400 --> 20:31.360
I don't know what I don't know what to think about any of it

20:31.360 --> 20:36.640
Don't you done this all like then propose the idea that we're pawns in something else's game

20:36.760 --> 20:42.720
There was a there was some old man that told Gary that gave Gary Daley's grandfather a book and told him to put a spell

20:42.720 --> 20:46.360
on us, I don't know I mean and then these things were chasing us and

20:46.880 --> 20:49.080
Maybe you two are pawns, you know

20:49.600 --> 20:54.200
Gary just showed us that thing that Harold Dorsey wrote and you know

20:54.200 --> 21:01.520
We saw that John Peters thing in Harold's thing. It says that you know, Maggie was trying to tip him off

21:02.120 --> 21:07.920
Do you think you know, maybe she knows more about this than she lets on or oh

21:08.920 --> 21:14.760
Certainly Maggie knows a lot more than she lets on perhaps except maybe to you Clark. I mean, I don't

21:15.480 --> 21:21.400
Whether or not we believe everything she said I think I've told you everything that she told me that there's the possibility now that

21:21.400 --> 21:25.360
It's either not the Maggie that we knew or it's it is a Maggie

21:25.360 --> 21:30.120
We knew and she maybe hurt the one that we didn't know or I don't know. I don't know what's going on now

21:30.640 --> 21:34.680
I think we may need to get a hold of her before we go to

21:35.880 --> 21:40.840
Confront Kane. I don't even know what we're gonna do about that. We've certainly got a lot to think about

21:40.920 --> 21:45.320
Let's just do one thing at a time. There's a giant spider on my keyboard right now

21:53.080 --> 21:55.920
Yeah, John rolls his eyes your keyboard a

21:55.920 --> 21:59.960
Spider on your keyboard. I've never heard of that one before

22:01.160 --> 22:06.600
Well, it's do any of y'all have any money on you right now. I got three dollars

22:09.880 --> 22:15.100
How about we wage your three dollars apiece on what on ourselves being the same

22:15.160 --> 22:22.100
Well, I if I think it might be all three of us or I don't care if it's me or you or Clark or all of

22:22.100 --> 22:26.020
Us but it is me. So sure. I'll bet my three dollars

22:29.700 --> 22:36.740
About it Clark, it's just three dollars. Just a friendly little wager. I mean, I don't want to bet against saving the world

22:36.740 --> 22:42.520
Is that the bet we're making that now now the bet is that you'll save the world, but it's three dollars

22:42.520 --> 22:43.820
It's just you know

22:43.820 --> 22:47.860
It's not gonna feel too bad when you both, you know have given me six dollars

22:47.860 --> 22:49.860
That'll

22:49.900 --> 22:55.620
Be nine dollars. Yeah, I mean sure. Yeah, sure. Oh, I guess I'll bet on it

22:55.620 --> 22:58.180
Hey, I'll race you do to the end of the tunnel. Yeah, I think I see

22:58.180 --> 23:03.420
I don't know what time of day it is, but I think I see the light up there if it is daytime

23:03.580 --> 23:08.400
Bet you can't beat me. I've start sprinting. I don't think Clark is gonna race

23:09.660 --> 23:11.260
John races

23:11.260 --> 23:13.900
All right, roll athletics the two of you

23:14.500 --> 23:21.180
John Lee petty more the third than Keith Vigna are racing down this very narrow pathway. Yeah, which is a

23:25.300 --> 23:30.020
25 as you guys are racing John Lee petty more you are

23:30.380 --> 23:37.460
a little bit behind because as you're saying like let's race keeping it just like took off and started sprinting and you chase after him

23:37.460 --> 23:39.980
And right when you're about to take the lead from him

23:40.140 --> 23:44.500
He trips over his own feet and lands face-first

23:44.860 --> 23:48.420
In the sewage just off to the left of the right side of this path

23:48.820 --> 23:53.460
That was confusing and lands face-first in the sewage in this little

23:54.180 --> 23:57.340
Small pathway that goes down the middle of this tunnel that you're in

23:57.740 --> 24:01.140
John just breezes past and raises both his arms in the air

24:02.580 --> 24:09.140
He just won the fucking Boston Marathon and both of your hands are now lit by sunlight

24:09.140 --> 24:14.980
That is coming in from a drain a storm drain. You're the it now and

24:18.420 --> 24:24.420
As I as I casually walk up to the point that Keith fell in I tried and offer a hand to help him out of

24:24.420 --> 24:30.900
There I stand up just the entire front side of me is covered and just thick

24:31.860 --> 24:33.660
green and brown

24:33.660 --> 24:35.260
Goo and

24:35.260 --> 24:42.460
I open my eyes and like you can just see my eyes are the only thing that aren't just covered in that color and

24:44.540 --> 24:46.540
Clark

24:49.660 --> 24:51.660
What do I do

24:55.620 --> 24:57.620
Grab Clark's hand

24:58.420 --> 25:06.340
And it kind of squids I try to like walk out of the middle and yeah, it's just like squeezing out of my shoes and

25:08.980 --> 25:15.820
Turn around and see this and I have to like suppress a strong Samaritan urge to mercy kill them both

25:17.940 --> 25:20.620
Let's go ahead and get some Constitution rolls for

25:21.780 --> 25:23.780
for how vile this is

25:24.340 --> 25:31.300
Keith you're at a negative 40 on this roll for being the one who fell in I have a plus 10 for my robot abilities

25:31.740 --> 25:35.920
At a negative 40, I would have 30 and I just rolled at 31

25:37.500 --> 25:43.580
Brings me up to 70, but I rolled a 75. Oof. What'd you give me negative 20 for having it all over your hand?

25:43.580 --> 25:46.460
I pass a 72 on a 95

25:46.460 --> 25:49.740
All right, 80 Clark is the only one who is not just like fully

25:50.340 --> 25:57.340
Wretching right now and the other two of you you're gonna take a negative 20 on all rolls until you can

25:57.660 --> 26:01.340
Figure out a way to alleviate this situation. So your abs are just like

26:02.140 --> 26:04.740
overkill working themselves because of how

26:08.820 --> 26:13.100
I like get near the storm drain. I take my shirt off and I try to use the

26:14.020 --> 26:20.860
Backside of it that's not like covered in stuff and try to like wipe my arms off a little bit and wipe my face

26:20.860 --> 26:23.980
and then I walk up to Keith's clean back and

26:28.280 --> 26:34.140
Yeah, so now I'm I'm shirtless my face has less goo my arms have less goo

26:34.460 --> 26:41.720
My hair's like matted on my face because of that and then I've got my big shorts on and you have John's vomit all over

26:43.220 --> 26:47.060
and I as I take a couple more steps, I realize that my

26:47.760 --> 26:52.880
Shoes are just soaked. So I go ahead and take my shoes and socks off to all right going barefoot

26:53.020 --> 26:57.660
That may be an issue if you need to step on stuff on spikes

27:00.340 --> 27:02.340
Role-playing baby

27:04.620 --> 27:06.620
Didn't suspect my knife floor

27:09.200 --> 27:11.360
You wanted to have a race did you

27:13.340 --> 27:15.340
I'm gonna go pee. Okay

27:18.780 --> 27:22.860
The fucking echo and your cavernous living room it that's perfect

27:33.060 --> 27:37.060
Keith vigna as you look up out of this storm drain

27:37.100 --> 27:41.320
You see the neighborhood that surrounds beans pond

27:41.580 --> 27:48.540
You can't quite see into the pond where the water is from this angle, but you know exactly where you are guys

27:48.540 --> 27:54.340
I think we're we're near Maggie's do you see smoldering remains of a house? I

27:55.980 --> 27:57.980
Can only smell one thing

28:00.260 --> 28:03.740
Guys take a look. I think we're here and then I pull my phone out and

28:04.380 --> 28:08.220
Type in something into my phone minimally toxic, okay

28:18.780 --> 28:23.700
Yeah, you probably probably don't want to use that phone again to get around some Clorox whaps though

28:24.300 --> 28:32.200
Yeah, I'll wash off in the pond when you say that you'll wash off in the pond you immediately remember your conversation with Claire

28:32.200 --> 28:37.980
Blankenship. Oh, yeah, there ain't no water in the pond. Do you guys want to crawl out first?

28:38.600 --> 28:40.600
So you don't have to you know, crawl through

28:41.200 --> 28:47.040
All this Clark happily takes him up on that. Yeah, we'll go and we'll go and order of soil

28:47.040 --> 28:52.720
I guess least the most I need everyone to roll to take out their headphones

28:56.360 --> 28:58.360
Power huh

28:59.360 --> 29:00.880
Yeah

29:00.880 --> 29:07.360
Fail 96. Wait, what is it's a negative what for my rules? You're a negative 20. I

29:08.640 --> 29:10.640
pass an 18

29:10.960 --> 29:16.840
60 fail 87 on a 30. Okay Thomas and Luke take off your headphones

29:16.840 --> 29:18.840
Oh

29:26.840 --> 29:29.880
Clark as you crawl out when you stand

29:30.600 --> 29:36.960
you can see that beans pond has been completely emptied of its contents and

29:37.520 --> 29:42.340
There's just this muddy basin there in the middle of this little like

29:42.980 --> 29:47.900
Neighborhood where these streets kind of cross and in the middle of this pond

29:48.380 --> 29:54.940
right next to a mostly buried metal door in the ground you see a

29:55.540 --> 30:00.380
Tank of fish to the brim just teeming and inside

30:00.820 --> 30:05.740
there is a gaunt little boy and he is

30:06.620 --> 30:09.780
Drowning and he is desperately trying to stay afloat

30:09.780 --> 30:16.060
But there's so many fish in this tank that they seem to be keeping him down how far away from all this

30:16.060 --> 30:16.500
Are we?

30:16.500 --> 30:22.260
okay, so literally you're on one side of the street when you when you get up and the pond is on the other side of

30:22.260 --> 30:24.260
the street across from you and

30:24.260 --> 30:29.220
Then the pond starts what like 10 yards past the other side of the street

30:29.220 --> 30:32.500
And so the middle of the pond is probably 15 yards past that

30:32.540 --> 30:37.980
So the middle where this is happening is about 25 yards away, okay, so yeah beans pond is not very big

30:37.980 --> 30:43.580
It's just like a no like a little little water hole, you know here and there it kind of mushrooms

30:43.580 --> 30:48.540
It's bigger at the top than it is at the bottom. Okay, and you can take your headphones off

30:48.740 --> 30:50.740
Cool

30:58.060 --> 31:05.740
Thomas as John Lee Pettymore climbs up out of this you see that across the street from where you are is beans pond and

31:06.220 --> 31:11.420
In the very middle of beans pond, which is now a muddy basin

31:12.060 --> 31:14.260
sans water sans fish

31:14.940 --> 31:18.060
Just mud and in the very center

31:18.220 --> 31:23.340
there is a mostly buried metal door in the ground and

31:24.000 --> 31:28.220
Standing there right next to it is Pastor Adam Kane

31:29.180 --> 31:36.700
Wearing an old motorcycle helmet that seems to have some weird tubes and you can kind of see that the red light is

31:36.900 --> 31:40.780
Lit on it John draws his gun and tells him to take the helmet off

31:44.260 --> 31:46.260
Oh

31:49.340 --> 31:53.220
Luke yes, as you crawl out you're just scraping this

31:53.700 --> 31:59.620
Disgusting refuse on to the side of the concrete as you drag your way out and it's kind of like building up

31:59.620 --> 32:02.060
you know as you pull yourself out and

32:02.860 --> 32:09.540
When you kind of stand up you see that across the street is beans pond, but there's no water

32:09.540 --> 32:11.500
There's no fish just as you expected

32:11.540 --> 32:15.380
But what you didn't really expect is to see you know in the very middle

32:15.620 --> 32:19.860
there's a mostly buried metal door in the ground and

32:20.580 --> 32:24.620
Sitting right next to it is an old motorcycle helmet

32:25.460 --> 32:30.220
With strange tubes and the light on it is green

32:30.220 --> 32:32.220
Oh

32:40.580 --> 32:47.580
And as soon as you're all standing up there John Lee Pettymore the third pulls his gun and hollers take off the helmet

32:48.020 --> 32:51.140
Take it off now. What would help would help with John?

32:52.060 --> 32:58.760
Who's wearing a helmet Adam Pastor Kane? What he's standing on the door? I don't there's no there's nobody there John

32:58.760 --> 33:02.680
There's like there's a kid who's floundering over there in that tank of fish right there. What do you talk?

33:02.680 --> 33:07.520
Well, no fish. There's just the helmets near the door on Adam Kane

33:07.600 --> 33:12.160
What clearly you two are not savior material and I pulled the trigger

33:13.440 --> 33:16.800
roll firearms three you fire and

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
Joe Luke take your headphones off

33:29.040 --> 33:34.880
Thomas when John Lee Pettymore fires aims true world damage rolled e10 eight

33:35.640 --> 33:37.640
immediately let me roll Constitution

33:38.420 --> 33:45.520
Pastor Adam Kane falls backwards and the helmet flies off of his head into the mud behind him and he lays

33:45.800 --> 33:51.360
Motionless on the ground right next to the metal door that is mostly buried in the ground

33:51.360 --> 33:55.680
I run up to administer first aid. Okay, John begins running into

33:56.560 --> 33:58.280
beans pond

33:58.280 --> 34:00.280
Rolled dexterity for me

34:00.760 --> 34:03.220
43 on a 45. Oh, yeah

34:03.220 --> 34:09.200
so as you kind of like get up to the edge you see it's just mud slide kind of down and

34:09.520 --> 34:13.160
You can put your feet wide enough apart to kind of

34:13.760 --> 34:19.800
balance as you kind of slide down into where the bottom of the pond was and

34:20.440 --> 34:23.880
You run up to administer first aid

34:28.280 --> 34:30.280
Oh

34:32.480 --> 34:38.200
Clark Bishop you see John Lee Pettymore fire his weapon into this tank and

34:39.080 --> 34:41.240
You see a lot less

34:42.040 --> 34:48.840
Movement from inside only the fish are going crazy and you see the water begins turning red

34:50.240 --> 34:56.920
Okay, Clark. What do you do? I'm running up to get a better look at what's what's

34:57.520 --> 35:02.520
Following John I'm following John I think right and he run in in the same direction that I would want to be running

35:02.880 --> 35:10.280
Absolutely, go ahead and roll a dexterity to try to like get into the bottom of the pond without slipping and falling. I

35:10.840 --> 35:13.980
Pass a 25 on a 60. All righty

35:13.980 --> 35:15.980
I

35:22.940 --> 35:28.340
John Lee Pettymore fires his weapon hits one of the tubes on this old motorcycle helmet the tube

35:28.660 --> 35:30.660
explodes just this and

35:30.900 --> 35:38.140
Then he runs into the base and slides down the side and then Clark Bishop follows right behind him. I run after

35:38.700 --> 35:39.860
them

35:39.860 --> 35:40.900
To

35:40.900 --> 35:46.100
Amazing go ahead and roll dexterity as well at a negative 20 as you're sliding down

35:46.100 --> 35:52.340
You can see this mud. It just kind of looks like the refuse that is all over you

35:52.340 --> 35:55.660
I gotta check my decks minus 20 to see if I pass

35:56.500 --> 36:03.580
Shirtless you have these giant. Oh nice. Okay, so I have 50 decks minus 20 is 30 and I rolled

36:05.140 --> 36:07.140
79

36:09.860 --> 36:11.700
I

36:11.700 --> 36:13.300
Had to do some math in my head

36:13.300 --> 36:19.900
But I fail Keith vignette eat shit as he's trying to get into this pond

36:20.340 --> 36:27.140
slips falls face forward into the mud and begins slowly sliding down the

36:27.620 --> 36:29.620
pond wall as

36:29.900 --> 36:33.780
the other two make their way into the very center and

36:34.380 --> 36:38.860
Immediately shots begin firing from either side of you

36:42.180 --> 36:44.180
Keith vignette

36:44.420 --> 36:46.140
You're face down in this mud

36:46.140 --> 36:50.740
You can feel yourself kind of sliding forward and then all of a sudden you feel a bullet

36:50.820 --> 36:58.140
Pierce into your ribs on your left side and you don't know whether it went all the way through but breathing becomes

36:58.580 --> 37:01.340
Extremely difficult as you take seven damage

37:02.140 --> 37:04.140
Shit

37:04.860 --> 37:10.460
Except you can't really breathe in too much because it's just mud all up in your face spot and shit

37:13.580 --> 37:15.580
Clark Bishop, it's your turn. What do you do?

37:15.900 --> 37:18.060
Clark wants to run up to

37:18.460 --> 37:24.340
The tank that I see and try and put myself between it and one of the you said it was coming from both sides

37:24.340 --> 37:30.900
Right the shooters. Yep, put the tank between one and another shooter and try to return fire from where I think it's coming from

37:30.900 --> 37:32.460
Okay roll

37:32.460 --> 37:34.460
search

37:35.060 --> 37:39.620
To see if you can figure out where these shots are coming from not alert news

37:40.540 --> 37:47.620
49 on us 20 for search. What's your alertness 70? Oh, man, your alertness is so much better than your search

37:49.020 --> 37:54.660
No, that'll play that'll play alertness would come in here because you're focused on doing something else and the shots are ringing out

37:54.660 --> 37:56.180
so you can kind of

37:56.180 --> 37:59.900
immediately see that there is a privacy fence and

38:00.500 --> 38:07.060
You see that there's a gun being held just like over the fence. That's just like firing. What do you do?

38:07.060 --> 38:10.460
I would like to try and fire at where I see the hand coming from

38:10.460 --> 38:16.220
I would be aiming for center mass if I could picture a person standing behind it through the fence. Okay, roll firearms. I

38:18.100 --> 38:25.740
Pass 47 on an 80. Okay, then roll a detentive damage. We'll subtract two for fence cover. We'll subtract one

38:25.740 --> 38:27.540
It's just a wooden fence

38:27.540 --> 38:35.340
Three okay minus one is two and you hear a yelp come out from that side a female voice screams out in pain

38:35.340 --> 38:41.460
John Lee Pettymore the third. What are you doing slowly realizing that if Adam Kane was wearing the helmet and

38:42.180 --> 38:46.380
Had already swapped that I might have just shot someone dear to me

38:46.420 --> 38:53.040
What if even he swapped drew out of Carrie Paige's body into his body and he's in Carrie Paige's bodies

38:53.240 --> 38:58.120
Anyway, I'm running up to I'm running up to the person I just shot and you you made it their last round

38:58.120 --> 39:02.180
So what are you doing you your goal was to get first aid on to this person?

39:02.180 --> 39:07.480
But shots began ringing out you can change what you were doing if you want or you can continue trying to do first aid

39:07.480 --> 39:11.120
I don't have a great first aid. Can I try to persuade them to first aid their selves?

39:13.240 --> 39:20.420
Yeah, he is still conscious oh no, he is unconscious he failed his constitution check I'd like to persuade him to become conscious

39:20.420 --> 39:22.420
When

39:23.100 --> 39:25.320
When I see Clark

39:25.900 --> 39:29.700
Shoot the person behind the fence or return fire in that direction

39:29.700 --> 39:35.660
I spin around the other direction and try to see where the other fire is coming from and I've got I've got both John's gun

39:39.580 --> 39:41.580
Man what a episode

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
Title

39:44.220 --> 39:45.860
90 on a 60

39:45.860 --> 39:52.140
It's not the kind of episode title you typically want but a 90 on a 60 is an equivalent of what you tried to say

39:52.140 --> 39:56.220
With your words and so it's your firing with both John's gun

39:57.060 --> 40:03.420
Neither one hits as your oh as you're trying to figure out where it came from where you fuck. Sorry

40:03.420 --> 40:10.500
You know, I just looking without you're just looking you cannot figure out where this these shots are coming from from the other side

40:10.500 --> 40:14.440
I fire a couple impotent shots into the air just to try to intimidate them

40:14.440 --> 40:18.980
That is the John Lee petty more way Keith Vigna. What are you doing? I want to ask you a question real quick

40:18.980 --> 40:20.900
I'm Zach. You can ask me a question at any time

40:20.900 --> 40:24.980
I guess they already know about that. I'm like part robot or whatever, but

40:25.500 --> 40:29.900
Would that have had any effect on when I got shot or was that I don't remember

40:30.620 --> 40:32.620
well mechanically

40:33.020 --> 40:38.100
Unfortunately, we didn't make that a thing which seems like it should have been it's probably doesn't matter

40:38.100 --> 40:40.440
I could have done better. But here we are. Okay

40:41.420 --> 40:45.700
Okay, so I was shot in the left side, right? Yeah, correct

40:45.700 --> 40:52.640
I like sit up or like sit on my butt. I wipe all the mud off my face and I blow

40:53.500 --> 40:59.340
the mud out of both my nostrils and then I shove my finger up my nose and

41:00.700 --> 41:04.700
get a little bump do you have on your character sheet what the

41:05.580 --> 41:11.780
Improvement is for doing that it has varied. Yeah, it was willpower based, but we weren't we're not really

41:12.300 --> 41:18.740
If you lose 10 luck, then I'll let you go ahead and make an action this turn. How about that? Okay, I'll

41:19.300 --> 41:22.460
Lose my 10 luck that I made the other day

41:23.180 --> 41:29.020
And I just want to sprint back up the wall of the not pool

41:29.540 --> 41:30.540
Absolutely

41:30.540 --> 41:34.180
Since I got shot in the left side. I want to like look over to that direction

41:34.260 --> 41:36.860
Is that where Clark is shooting at?

41:36.860 --> 41:42.460
I was picturing in my head that I was shooting to the right because that was where the tank kind of was

41:42.740 --> 41:47.020
Like I would put myself shooting over it to the right. Yeah, he was shooting the right

41:47.020 --> 41:52.140
So John was shooting up in the air, but he was looking left. I'm gonna draw a quick map real quick

41:52.780 --> 41:57.000
Keith you got hit from the left side, which is the side that

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
John is kind of looking for someone on that side. So I want to turn around run up the

42:03.600 --> 42:05.600
wall of the pond and

42:05.940 --> 42:11.520
So that at that point I'll be on my right look over to the right and do I see any anybody or any?

42:12.080 --> 42:14.360
first off go ahead and roll a

42:15.160 --> 42:20.040
Dexterity or athletics to get back up without slipping at a negative 20 still fail

42:20.040 --> 42:23.800
So as you're trying to slide back up, you're kind of looking off to the right

42:23.800 --> 42:30.360
But you can't get your grip on this mud for long enough to be able to keep your head straight

42:31.080 --> 42:37.840
especially with this deep pain coming in your side and shots begin firing off once more as

42:38.760 --> 42:42.020
The shots fire off. None of you get hit Clark

42:42.480 --> 42:49.480
One of the bullets flies right by your ear and the other ones are all hitting the mud right next to Keith Vigna

42:49.900 --> 42:53.460
Clark Bishop, it's your turn is the person behind the fence still shooting

42:53.800 --> 42:56.880
Yes, I'm gonna shoot again. I want them to stop shooting

42:57.760 --> 42:59.760
Roll it up, baby

43:00.720 --> 43:04.400
Pass 23 on an 80 roll a d10 a

43:06.280 --> 43:11.640
Two okay fence is still in the way so you kind of aim low and you

43:13.720 --> 43:20.920
There that was a weird noise it wasn't the correct noise, sorry, okay, that was an alarming noise. Yeah

43:24.640 --> 43:26.920
Specifically wasn't Drew's voice, please. No

43:28.560 --> 43:32.400
Okay, John Lee Pettymore, what are you doing since they kept firing on us?

43:32.400 --> 43:38.760
have I now identified where the fire on the left is coming from if you roll a search or an alertness with a

43:39.080 --> 43:42.560
Plus 20 since they've done been firing she haven't teen

43:42.660 --> 43:49.260
Yeah, you actually see that there is someone hiding behind a grill in someone's backyard

43:49.420 --> 43:52.900
There's no privacy fence on this backyard and on their deck

43:53.220 --> 44:00.260
There's a little propane grill and there's someone hiding right behind it and they keep poking up and firing

44:00.260 --> 44:05.460
I'd like to fire back anything cool. This is the end of your stakeout, buddy

44:08.140 --> 44:15.380
Plus 20 on the firearms check 29 roll a d10 for damage 3 I rolled the tens one

44:15.380 --> 44:17.380
Will you give me the 30?

44:19.740 --> 44:24.340
You fire and you hear a man's voice cry out and he's like

44:25.740 --> 44:29.180
Keith Vigna, what are you doing stuff? I'm gonna try to get out of the

44:29.820 --> 44:32.860
Pond again, and yeah, you'll be able to make it out on this turn

44:32.860 --> 44:36.140
Okay, I do that and then when I hear John yell

44:36.140 --> 44:40.780
I want to look over and can I see the guy too or do I need to roll a check?

44:41.180 --> 44:41.700
No

44:41.700 --> 44:48.140
Now the John has shot him and he's kind of shown himself both people have been shot and you guys kind of know where they

44:48.140 --> 44:50.780
At least were last round at the beginning

44:50.780 --> 44:57.820
I'm going to pull my gun out and run towards the grill and I'm gonna fire as I'm running

44:57.980 --> 45:00.960
Go ahead and roll a negative 20 a 9

45:01.780 --> 45:03.780
So yeah, I'd be 10 for damage

45:04.340 --> 45:06.340
6 yeah, I'll do

45:07.580 --> 45:13.940
Cool as you're running you're kind of like slipping on the mud a little bit and you're smelling all of this shit and mud

45:13.940 --> 45:14.500
that's just

45:14.500 --> 45:19.780
Covering you at this point and you fire and you hit this dude as he's like laying on the ground

45:20.060 --> 45:20.900
John hit him

45:20.900 --> 45:27.260
He kind of fell over and you fire you hit him right in the torso and he kind of rolls over and he's facing

45:27.260 --> 45:33.220
you and you see at this point Asher little who is one of the parents of

45:33.940 --> 45:39.880
Aiden and Alice little who went missing a couple days ago and you see that he has

45:40.040 --> 45:46.920
Laser faded jeans that are bedazzled and he's wearing a long-sleeve shirt that is skin tight to his

45:47.160 --> 45:50.980
Crossfit body and the front of the shirt has a picture of his children

45:51.560 --> 45:59.000
Aiden and Alice who are twin nine-year-olds and he is wearing a fair amount of makeup and he is rocking some Yeezys and

45:59.160 --> 46:02.000
he is crying out in pain and

46:02.600 --> 46:05.820
You don't know if he's gonna be able to get back up, but he is not

46:06.540 --> 46:11.840
Unconscious yet. Was he one of the guys in one of the cars or trucks?

46:11.840 --> 46:16.160
That was the Impala that was coming after you guys that had a refrigerator

46:16.260 --> 46:22.880
Yeah, he was driving that longs to the littles and you recognize the two of them from driving it and they are

46:23.500 --> 46:28.100
members of the first Church of contention and now the first

46:29.060 --> 46:35.100
Creek family of contention from behind the fence the gun raises again just fires

46:35.820 --> 46:38.960
Aimlessly hitting the mud around you

46:39.700 --> 46:41.700
but asher little

46:41.900 --> 46:47.780
Mustering all this strength like like the end of that Keanu Reeves Patrick Shweezy movie

46:47.780 --> 46:54.260
But instead of moving to fire up into the air. He just fires directly at Keith Vigna and he hits him

46:55.140 --> 46:57.140
There's seven more damage. Oh

46:57.620 --> 46:59.620
Fuck

47:00.140 --> 47:07.180
Yeah, you're just out in the open yeah, I'm at 10 health at this point you're 24 total

47:07.180 --> 47:11.700
Yep, holy shit when you went from 17 down to 10

47:12.220 --> 47:17.420
he hits you in the hip and you feel it hit the bone and

47:18.100 --> 47:22.900
You think it might have cracked as you begin like limping?

47:23.340 --> 47:27.820
Toward him in that direction and you you're just oh my you

47:28.500 --> 47:32.620
Real crunch, you know, you you don't feel good. It's pain

47:33.220 --> 47:38.980
I've never been shot by a gun, but my drugs helped me any with that pain. No, okay

47:38.980 --> 47:43.820
Okay, and an adrenaline doesn't help them with the pain. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah

47:43.820 --> 47:48.900
You've been shot twice once in the ribs once in the hip and you're still standing. So yeah fucking helps

47:49.220 --> 47:51.140
There we go, okay

47:51.140 --> 47:58.800
Again, I'm just gonna continue limping as fast as I can at him Clark Bishop. You're up and as this round begins

47:59.660 --> 48:03.420
Clark Bishop, there is no tank here

48:04.220 --> 48:11.100
There are no fish here and John Lee Pettymore the body that is right next to you not there

48:11.500 --> 48:14.140
the only thing the two of you see on the ground is

48:15.140 --> 48:18.620
Is this metal door that is mostly buried

48:19.140 --> 48:23.660
Looks completely sealed and it says here lies the beans

48:24.780 --> 48:26.780
scientists beyond measure

48:27.100 --> 48:32.380
Saviors of the world god damn it if he's the fucking Savior

48:34.840 --> 48:41.320
Clark Bishop, what do you do seeing the fish tank disappear kind of throws me, but I'm yelling back at Keith Keith

48:41.360 --> 48:46.000
They're shooting at you get down and I would like to try and see if I could pry that door open

48:46.120 --> 48:49.200
Like that's the only thing I could find cover if I could get that door open

48:49.640 --> 48:56.760
I'm trying to write open as you try to find any sort of crease or anything. There's nothing

48:56.760 --> 49:00.340
There's no handle on this door. There's no hinges on this door

49:00.720 --> 49:05.880
It almost doesn't even look like a door other than the fact that that's how I've described it so far

49:06.200 --> 49:08.200
Like

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
An impassable metal plate

49:11.560 --> 49:13.560
yeah, almost like

49:14.160 --> 49:20.160
Yeah, an impassable metal plate. I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll just edit out you saying it and then I'll say it

49:20.840 --> 49:22.840
perfect

49:22.880 --> 49:27.360
Listeners may not know but I've come up with the entire story and plot of

49:28.680 --> 49:32.960
Podcast as we go and I just generously let Zach edit that out. I

49:33.960 --> 49:36.820
Hope he doesn't accidentally leave this one in this time

49:38.280 --> 49:43.720
He's a promise and he would definitely knows exactly what's going on at all times

49:44.600 --> 49:50.640
100% command of the story the characters the events as they have transpired thus far

49:51.720 --> 49:53.720
I'm all over it, baby

49:56.480 --> 50:01.700
Clark as you're trying to figure out how to open this door you look up and you see that there is no fish tank

50:01.820 --> 50:03.820
Whatsoever in front of you roll sanity

50:08.180 --> 50:12.060
Yeah, baby, it's a 70 that's a fail over my power

50:12.060 --> 50:16.260
Oh my god, Zach on the fucking webcam just started like

50:16.980 --> 50:22.060
Curling his fingers like a super when he heard that Joe had rolled over his power

50:24.500 --> 50:28.820
What do I lose you just lose one sanity, but you also lose your shit

50:28.940 --> 50:31.900
So Clark was going to hit the deck since he doesn't have any cover

50:31.900 --> 50:37.860
But now he's gonna stand up like nothing could hurt him and charge the person behind the fence

50:38.240 --> 50:40.700
Shooting the whole way as he runs so we'll go

50:41.580 --> 50:49.980
negative 20 for blinding anger on the firearms check as you make your way up out of the muddy basin that you have found yourself in a

50:50.740 --> 50:54.100
bowl of slop I pass a

50:54.580 --> 50:57.700
52 on a 60 nice roll a d10

50:58.820 --> 51:06.180
6 you fire in and you actually have knocked away enough of this fence at this point that

51:06.180 --> 51:12.940
You see a woman who is wearing a skin tight t-shirt that has two children's faces

51:13.340 --> 51:20.180
On it and you recognize these two children as Aiden and Alice little gonna sexualize a grieving mother. I

51:21.060 --> 51:23.060
wasn't going to

51:24.060 --> 51:29.380
What just happened skin tight t-shirt, oh, that's all that it takes for you

51:34.500 --> 51:38.520
They do CrossFit man, I don't know what to tell you I am aroused and offended

51:41.260 --> 51:43.260
Typical

51:45.620 --> 51:52.220
And you hit what is very likely in your mind Avery little and she falls backward and

51:52.700 --> 51:56.740
You just hear this moaning. How about that? Do you like that Thomas?

51:57.380 --> 52:00.180
From behind the fence that's been blown away

52:07.620 --> 52:13.780
John Lee Pettymore, it's your turn rule the body that was once there is no longer. I need you to roll sanity

52:13.780 --> 52:17.800
He's gonna freak out but that's also a huge relief to him 13 pass

52:18.040 --> 52:24.920
Okay, you don't need to freak out and you don't need to lose in the sanity you are extremely relieved that you didn't shoot

52:24.920 --> 52:28.320
What might have been a person is Asher still firing?

52:28.520 --> 52:33.640
Yeah, and he's a he's actually he's firing at Keith vignette and he's falling

52:33.640 --> 52:36.880
I fire at Asher go ahead and roll that firearms check

52:37.360 --> 52:39.680
16 well d10 for damage

52:40.560 --> 52:42.560
to mmm

52:43.560 --> 52:44.680
As

52:44.680 --> 52:50.160
You fire it's not enough to take him down as blood splatters on the concrete behind him of this

52:50.360 --> 52:56.320
This little back deck that he's on but his eyes are wide open and his aim is still

52:56.720 --> 53:01.720
Directed at Keith vigna who is slowly trudging toward him and Keith vigna

53:01.720 --> 53:05.080
It is your turn and it is likely an important one

53:05.640 --> 53:09.520
Can I just say something guys say something that you're allowed to it's a podcast

53:09.520 --> 53:12.680
There's only four of us you got no, you know when Joe and I

53:14.200 --> 53:20.000
Farcically disappeared these children, you know a very a very light-hearted

53:21.640 --> 53:23.640
Goofy

53:24.480 --> 53:31.160
Almost whimsical. Yeah cartoonish disappearance Mary Poppins esque. I thought that'd be the last we heard of it. I didn't realize

53:32.440 --> 53:34.440
There would be these kind of consequences

53:35.280 --> 53:37.560
angry citizenry angry parents

53:39.600 --> 53:43.900
Didn't really think anybody would miss the kids while this shit was going down, but I yeah

53:43.900 --> 53:46.940
I just want to say admire here

53:56.920 --> 54:00.240
Just kidding, I'll probably amp it up Keith vigna. What are you doing?

54:00.800 --> 54:06.360
The pain is starting to get to me. So I am gonna like get down on my knees and

54:06.960 --> 54:08.960
Like

54:14.480 --> 54:21.260
Get down on my knees and aim at Asher and fire Adam shirtless he's covered in all sorts of

54:36.360 --> 54:38.360
Hey

54:40.520 --> 54:45.120
Luke yeah, what are you doing, man? I just tell you I'm on oh shit. I

54:47.080 --> 54:49.080
Shot him

54:49.080 --> 54:51.080
Tell you to roll firearms

54:51.520 --> 54:53.520
69

54:53.840 --> 54:58.580
Don't don't touch him. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands. Don't move your hands put the other one up in the air

54:58.800 --> 55:00.960
Are you gonna run in there and check? Yes, I am

55:00.960 --> 55:07.880
Guys if he if he moves his hands, you tell me we're on him Luke move your hands

55:11.280 --> 55:19.920
Don't need to I did it don't have to lie to us. He's not in the room. Holy fucking shit. It's a goddamn 69

55:22.920 --> 55:28.520
I was about to actually scream, but then I remember my girlfriend went to bed and was like, please don't scream

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
But it was a 69, honey

55:35.680 --> 55:37.680
She can't argue with that, right

55:39.160 --> 55:41.160
She gets it what are we talking about?

55:41.400 --> 55:46.680
Just how I told my girlfriend I wouldn't scream during this session and I really wanted to win the girl

55:47.560 --> 55:49.560
Would you confirm that?

55:50.520 --> 55:53.800
Taylor's asleep. So I thought you're talking about me running through the house

55:57.360 --> 56:00.500
Saying I could be like, well, it's not as bad as what's act

56:01.960 --> 56:06.480
Exactly. Can you imagine being married to that monster? Okay, so

56:09.920 --> 56:14.760
Keith do you want to shoot this dude dead? Do you want to keep him alive or do you want to hit the propane tank?

56:16.200 --> 56:20.600
Okay. Yeah, I want to kill him. I want to hit him actually fuck it. I want to hit the propane tank

56:21.920 --> 56:24.020
These both have consequences. I'm sure

56:25.400 --> 56:28.300
Yeah, we stopped whose house is this stop getting shot

56:28.300 --> 56:35.180
It's season two you guys are just playing citizens in contention and then all of a sudden

56:39.660 --> 56:42.300
Okay, so I dropped down on my knees and

56:43.100 --> 56:46.160
I like have Asher in my sights

56:46.680 --> 56:53.100
But I just noticed the propane tank that's right next to him under the grill. I aim a little bit left

56:53.820 --> 57:01.460
Fire a couple rounds the propane tank explodes and I say soy beans puto

57:03.740 --> 57:06.300
That's actually dope that means I am beans bitch

57:11.100 --> 57:15.220
It's also a cross-lingual soybeans, but

57:17.460 --> 57:22.060
Okay, that was incredible take ten look back

57:23.220 --> 57:25.220
sweet, thanks

57:25.860 --> 57:29.420
Did you actually roll for any of that that was the 69 that was my 69

57:30.540 --> 57:32.540
That's why he's allowed to do whatever he wants

57:35.140 --> 57:37.140
After it explodes I

57:37.180 --> 57:43.180
Look down into the pond and want to start heading towards those guys. Okay. Yeah for sure

57:43.180 --> 57:47.340
I just assumed that the fiery explosion killed him it did

57:48.260 --> 57:51.380
Tight, I knew that already though. I didn't even have to see it

57:52.340 --> 57:55.420
So Keith you don't even look behind you as this

57:56.140 --> 57:58.140
grill explodes

57:58.180 --> 58:05.740
throwing the body of Asher little through the backsliding glass door of this home as it

58:05.740 --> 58:07.740
glass shatters and

58:08.380 --> 58:13.140
Your eyes are set at the bottom of the pond

58:13.620 --> 58:17.580
but above that Clark Bishop is walking up the other side and

58:17.780 --> 58:23.660
Makes his way to the fence and as you're trying to look through where you've been shooting through the fence and these holes that you've

58:23.660 --> 58:24.660
made

58:24.660 --> 58:29.620
The person you've been aiming at seems to have crawled out of view. What do you do?

58:29.620 --> 58:35.380
Have I got my eyes out? Am I still under that over the power role? Have you got?

58:36.380 --> 58:39.180
Yaws out Thomas you into it

58:39.820 --> 58:41.300
No

58:41.300 --> 58:45.480
Don't like any of you needlessly sexualized sexualized in this

58:45.480 --> 58:52.520
And yes, you are you are done Clark with your yeah. Yes. I kind of want to just yell

58:53.160 --> 58:58.160
Stop stop shooting. I'll stop shooting. Stop shooting and I'll stop shooting. Do I get any you just hear?

58:58.680 --> 59:01.720
Prayer. Yes. Thank you Jesus. Oh god. Yes

59:01.720 --> 59:09.600
no, and there's times like these where retribution is the only necessary thing in the eyes of those who are light in the Lord and

59:09.880 --> 59:10.840
To

59:10.840 --> 59:13.040
pervade the evil of this world

59:13.040 --> 59:18.400
We must desecrate the bodies of those who are succumbing to the pleasures of this earth

59:18.480 --> 59:23.400
Can I strafe left and right around that hole to try and get an angle that I can see?

59:23.440 --> 59:29.720
Yeah, as you strafe through the hole and see her she is on the ground directly aimed up at you

59:29.720 --> 59:33.640
She'd readied in action with a successful firearms check and she fires

59:34.320 --> 59:37.240
Directly through the hole at you and rolled a nine

59:37.240 --> 59:39.240
For

59:39.640 --> 59:41.640
Damage

59:42.040 --> 59:45.720
For damage, yeah, what were you Alan hit point? I'm at 20

59:46.360 --> 59:51.040
Okay, so you go down to a well, I'm sorry. I'm at 26. I was full goodness gracious

59:51.040 --> 59:55.380
So you go down to 15 quick math. That's uh, you do that's 11

59:56.720 --> 59:59.880
yeah, I would be not that you go down to 17 and

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.680
That's slow math. Well quick math isn't necessarily good

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.400
First math

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.960
First math Beth math. Oh, that's

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.960
First math best math

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.400
hard to say

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.400
first math best math

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:28.200
All right, so we've got a new math best math. Yeah, say it faster though first math best math

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.400
first math best math

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.120
Well, I shouldn't be in radio Clark you got hit

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.600
We've it's a wall for the radio

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:47.000
so Clark gets hit directly in the shoulder and you just feel the blow back through and

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:55.560
It's your turn. I want to shoot her a return fire. I want to return fire. She just shot me. I wanna shoot her

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.520
roll firearms

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.520
I pass a 36 on an 8k roll damage

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.760
Fuck a three. Yeah, that'll extinguish her life. So

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:16.820
As you put out this fire of a human being John John Lee Pettymore comes up behind and surveys the scene and says

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.040
Ashers to ashers dust to dust

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.480
And Avery's to Avery's I think mine was better

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.840
Kind of why I think I'm the savior I'm running over to him

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.800
And I'm like guys did you hear what I said, did you hear what I said when I shot it I

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:43.920
Got him. Yeah, you were said you were talking about soybeans. Yeah, it's Spanish. Did you hear my thing about Asher's to Asher's?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.520
Yeah, that was really good, too. Thanks

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.200
So did you did you destroy the helmet Oh

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.040
When you shot it Clark is looking puzzled at you

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.000
But I never I'm there was never a helmet guys

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.800
Right down there and I point when you look down you see no helmet and I need you to roll a sanity. Oh good

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.680
72 so over my power and

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.640
Fail and how many and how many do I lose just one? Okay, I hit my breaking point

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.040
I

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.880
Look go ahead and roll a D 100 and for each time you roll it out of three times

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:41.240
I will tell you what your option of a mania will be from the table 10 from Call of Cthulhu 7th edition called

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.680
Sample mania is okay. First roll is a 14

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.000
14 is going to be a rhythm a

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.440
Rith arith mania obsessive preoccupation with numbers

01:02:52.440 --> 01:03:00.000
Okay, second one's 29 29 is going to be color o mania obsession with a specific color and

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:07.400
57 and 57 is icon o mania obsession with icons or portraits. I'll go with that one

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.400
Yeah, do you still have that picture? I do indeed. Yep, that'll that'll help. Okay, cool

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.400
So

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:27.240
As Keith Vigna looks at the helmet and Clark Bishop's like there's never a helmet there did

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.000
One of you took when he took the helmet when he took the helmet who took Keith

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.520
There was never a helmet there wouldn't help. I saw I saw John shoot the helmet

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.960
Did did you guys take my picture too? Did you did you take that photo and I have to start searching my pockets?

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.480
it's in my back pocket and I look at it and I like

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.440
Hide it from him Keith. This is mine. This is mine Keith. Who's who's in the picture right now?

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.200
It's still me still me milder grave gave us that picture. We couldn't have taken it. No, no

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.440
I'm it like took it from me. Oh, I've still got it. What what's what's the door?

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:08.280
Say fucking he's gonna find out just fucking show it says the beans thing. All right, it says the beans thing

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.960
Here here lies the beans it's safe saviors plural of the world. I want to run down and read it for myself

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.440
everybody roll power

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.840
power

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.720
Pass 31 on the city. I got another nine. I pass a 45 on a 60

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.640
the door failed

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:37.860
Clark Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore you all won the power contest this time

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:44.020
And you each feel a loosening of some external forces grip on your perception

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.580
And the scene, you know and a single blink has changed completely

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:53.160
beans pond is encircled entirely by the

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:58.660
Six-story tall wall of water and the three of you on the inside of the foul-smelling

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.900
floating moat

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:06.900
Clark and John this unnatural feat of nonsense is right behind you and you can see ice

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:08.700
forming on the water

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:16.020
always broken immediately by one of the many fish hopping out sideways and plopping back in with the force of this

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:23.000
horizontal gravity Keith begins running down into the muddy basin to see the engraving on this

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:29.060
impassable metal plate careful not to slip and fall face first in the mud again

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.860
But across the pond on the other bank is a whole situation

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:39.460
Casey Kristoff the mullet rocking janitor of the first Church of contention

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:45.080
holds a pistol to the back of Carrie Paige's head who is

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:51.380
Blindfolded and on her knees and right next to them is Pastor Adam Cain

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:58.140
Wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet red light lit and he is driving the four-wheeler

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:04.540
About to drop into this former pond and he's aiming straight for Keith

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:11.800
Strapped to the back of the four-wheeler you found an a-plus storage crashed in the woods and had drew fix up all nice

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:20.060
Strapped in behind Big Daddy Cain is the radio with the odd glass tubes and its green light is lit

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:27.500
And sitting atop this unnatural radio claws holding on for dear life is an extremely

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.220
determined black cat

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.740
Try

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
Yeah
