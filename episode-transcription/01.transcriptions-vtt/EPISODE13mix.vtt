00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Long time no see, my pack of pups, it's friend of all canines, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all

00:06.160 --> 00:13.720
from 694.2 PTBP, voted contention's number one radio show that you leave on so your dogs

00:13.720 --> 00:16.920
won't feel lonely while you're at work.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.200
Now y'all know we got some words from our listeners who have taken the time to shout

00:21.200 --> 00:23.560
us out on social media.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.960
It's time for Howlin' with Wolf.

00:26.960 --> 00:33.160
Wolf, I'd like to shout out to the lovely police force that we have here in contention.

00:33.160 --> 00:37.920
I appreciate the stellar job they doin' in keeping us, the citizens, safe.

00:37.920 --> 00:43.600
Why, if they weren't such good officers we might have things like busloads of transients

00:43.600 --> 00:49.440
or people dying of blunt force trauma, hell yeah, or even dangerous men on the streets

00:49.440 --> 00:51.520
disguised as police.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.280
I sure am glad that we don't have to worry about anything like that here in contention

00:56.280 --> 00:59.720
because of the work those fine officers put in.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.480
From Kennedy.

01:02.480 --> 01:08.160
Thanks Kennedy for believin' in our local police heroes without even the slightest awareness

01:08.160 --> 01:09.920
of your own surroundings.

01:09.920 --> 01:16.440
Now quick, turn the radio off now before you learn a thing or two, it's time for the news.

01:16.440 --> 01:22.600
The officers implemented an actually decent plan for a sting operation but the FBI was

01:22.600 --> 01:25.800
watching and steppin' in on the whole thing.

01:25.800 --> 01:32.080
Agents Kennedy and McKinley are in town lookin' for a black Nike bag with nothin' in it.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.880
The federal agents have agreed to meet the contention squad tomorrow mornin' December

01:36.880 --> 01:40.120
4th at the police department.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.920
When the party met up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures,

01:44.920 --> 01:50.360
Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them that he went

01:50.360 --> 01:53.440
to the chief's house.

01:53.440 --> 01:57.400
Officers Bishop and Bettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual

01:57.400 --> 02:03.080
residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on ol' Drew.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.240
Officers Bishop and Bettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded

02:08.240 --> 02:14.720
leaving the unconscious officer Vigna and Drew Andrews in the cold yard.

02:14.720 --> 02:20.520
That explosion also left behind the burnt bodies of Harold Dorsey, Chief Maggie Cook

02:20.520 --> 02:27.720
and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat.

02:27.720 --> 02:32.920
Foot meat, good feet, could eat, would eat.

02:32.920 --> 02:39.560
Sorry my dearest, I just done broke but puttin' me back together is kudzu with no backbone.

02:50.520 --> 03:17.440
I get my hot cocoa and I walk over to my fellow officers, okay guys, can we walk away from

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
Drew?

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
Yeah I think we should.

03:20.360 --> 03:24.080
I wanted to talk to like one of the firefighters, was anybody in there, did anybody in there

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
make it?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
No!

03:26.080 --> 03:27.080
That's what I figured.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.440
Keith who was in there besides the chief?

03:28.440 --> 03:32.840
So I knocked on the door and the door just kinda opened up by itself and it wasn't on

03:32.840 --> 03:33.840
fire at this point?

03:33.840 --> 03:39.320
No but I walked in and it smelled like gasoline and the gas from like a stove.

03:39.320 --> 03:44.920
So I walked in and I immediately saw Drew and some guy, whatever that, whoever's ID

03:44.920 --> 03:47.520
I showed you, they were just laying on the ground.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.280
That fake newsman from the city.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.640
And then I looked over and I walked in a little more and I saw Maggie just, her face was all

03:54.640 --> 04:00.880
slashed up and her left foot was missing and I walked in because I could smell the gas

04:00.880 --> 04:04.840
so I walked into the kitchen to turn the burners off before there was an explosion or anything

04:04.840 --> 04:09.360
but as soon as I turned the corner I saw another guy slumped over on the kitchen table with

04:09.360 --> 04:15.040
a fork in his hand and his left foot was missing too and all four burners were on the stove

04:15.120 --> 04:20.800
and there were two feet in a skillet and all the meat had been picked off of them and as

04:20.800 --> 04:24.960
soon as I went off, went over to turn them off I just felt dizzy and I threw up and I

04:24.960 --> 04:30.440
kind of, I like had to fall down and I hit something with my hand and as soon as I hit

04:30.440 --> 04:35.440
something with my hand, something ticked at the front of the house and a flame just started

04:35.440 --> 04:40.480
coming from the line of gasoline and I grabbed the fire extinguisher and I tried to put it

04:40.480 --> 04:44.160
out as best I could but I slipped and fell in my own vomit.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.120
I'm sorry to laugh, it's a difficult time.

04:49.120 --> 04:55.440
I fell in my own vomit and I got up and I was spraying the fire extinguisher and I kind

04:55.440 --> 05:00.680
of had to jump over the bodies to keep spraying the fire and I realized that I didn't know

05:00.680 --> 05:04.600
how much of use that was so I turned around and I knew I couldn't get both the guys so

05:04.600 --> 05:11.120
I grabbed Drew and I just hauled out of there and I think as soon as we got out of the front

05:11.120 --> 05:16.280
the door had exploded and just threw us back and then I was unconscious after that.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.200
When you said you heard a click and then there was fire?

05:19.200 --> 05:24.280
Yeah, when I fell down I hit something with my hand like a wire or a trap or something

05:24.280 --> 05:25.480
to start the fire.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.200
Well, Clock, we know we didn't start the fire.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.200
It was there before us.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.200
It was always burning.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.200
What the fuck?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
Well this is horrific.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.160
Eating their feet you said, eating their feet you said.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.200
I didn't see anybody eat the feet but they were cooked and the meat was picked off of

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
the feet.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.860
Alright, we're going to have to monitor and you don't know what they say.

05:43.860 --> 05:48.680
I think we need to, someone, maybe you should pick through Drew's poop for the next two

05:48.680 --> 05:50.000
days and make sure they don't find their toenails.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
It did smell like poop when I walked in there and I don't know if anybody asked Drew if

05:55.000 --> 05:58.720
he pooped himself.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.080
I figured it could have been from that or it could have been, I don't know.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.820
The guy at the table slumped over with the fork.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.000
I didn't get a good look at him.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Nothing about him?

06:07.000 --> 06:11.720
My first instinct was to turn the gas off and turn the fire off before I got exploded.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.720
Luckily I didn't.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.920
Yeah, just in time.

06:14.920 --> 06:21.200
Keith Vigna, roll an intelligence check for me to see if you remember some information.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.200
I don't.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.140
You don't remember some information.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.480
But he does remember other information.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.920
But there's some that I don't.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
Damn.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.600
Is the house currently on fire?

06:32.600 --> 06:36.060
No, it's more like embers.

06:36.060 --> 06:40.300
Was this for something that you told me or was this for something that I would have known

06:40.300 --> 06:41.300
if I got...

06:41.300 --> 06:46.460
That was for something that you would have remembered, but not something that I told

06:46.460 --> 06:47.460
you during this.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.460
Cause I was going to be like, maybe I shouldn't have.

06:49.460 --> 06:50.460
Just tell me.

06:50.460 --> 06:51.460
Yeah, no.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.100
I'd like to go talk to the, the chief firefighter here.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.100
Yeah.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.100
Am I speaking to him now?

06:57.100 --> 06:58.100
Yeah, that's me.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.100
Hey, uh, John.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.100
John Peters.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.100
God dammit.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.740
John Lee Pettymore, uh, Contention PD.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.740
Hey John.

07:04.740 --> 07:05.740
Hey.

07:06.420 --> 07:07.780
I've met many times working in a small town.

07:07.780 --> 07:08.780
Of course.

07:08.780 --> 07:09.780
I'm fireman chief.

07:09.780 --> 07:10.780
Yeah.

07:10.780 --> 07:12.380
We, you're fireman chief.

07:12.380 --> 07:17.500
We all respect the hell out of you and the game that, you know, you boys bring, uh, every

07:17.500 --> 07:22.180
year to the, uh, fireman policemen volleyball tournament.

07:22.180 --> 07:25.500
It's always a fierce game of volleyball, but that's why we love it.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Yeah.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
So, hey, you got any leads?

07:27.500 --> 07:30.540
Uh, you got any idea where this fire started or how it started?

07:30.540 --> 07:35.660
Well, it looks like there was a lot of gasoline in the house and I think a natural gas was

07:35.660 --> 07:37.800
the thing that really started the fire.

07:37.800 --> 07:43.620
The gasoline definitely helped keep the fire going and made it very difficult for us to

07:43.620 --> 07:44.620
do our jobs.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.740
It's interesting you say both those things because I was unclear while others were telling

07:48.740 --> 07:52.740
the story whether they meant, at first it seemed like they were smelling gasoline and

07:52.740 --> 07:54.380
then they, the burners were on.

07:54.380 --> 08:00.500
So the burners were probably all on as well as many cans of actual gasoline poured over

08:00.500 --> 08:03.860
the entire place and also just sitting around.

08:03.860 --> 08:04.860
Hey man.

08:04.860 --> 08:05.860
Did you get that?

08:05.860 --> 08:08.900
I mean, I know you've been going out for them VO auditions.

08:08.900 --> 08:09.900
I didn't get it.

08:09.900 --> 08:10.900
Yeah.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.820
Oh, they said that I need to be deeper.

08:12.820 --> 08:13.820
Yeah.

08:13.820 --> 08:14.820
You just keep working on that man.

08:14.820 --> 08:18.340
I can try, but I can only go so deep.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.340
Go down.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.340
Meet me down here.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.340
Down.

08:21.340 --> 08:22.340
Meet me down here.

08:22.340 --> 08:23.340
Down.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.340
Meet me down here.

08:24.340 --> 08:25.340
Down.

08:25.340 --> 08:30.160
I walk up and I'm like, what are you guys singing?

08:30.160 --> 08:32.340
I was wondering if we're trying to sing a tune of justice.

08:32.340 --> 08:35.620
I don't know who that other guy in there was.

08:35.620 --> 08:38.300
How badly are, is the bones burnt?

08:38.300 --> 08:39.920
Oh, they're very burnt.

08:39.920 --> 08:43.480
But there's a way to get some DNA out of those bones, huh?

08:43.480 --> 08:45.680
That's more our, just that's our department.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
I look at the bones.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.940
I say, we can get some DNA out of those bones.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.580
Do we have three bodies in there?

08:50.580 --> 08:51.580
Yes.

08:51.580 --> 08:52.580
Three bodies in the house.

08:52.580 --> 08:53.580
Oh, okay.

08:53.580 --> 08:55.580
I was thinking the other guy got out or something.

08:55.580 --> 08:56.580
I didn't think.

08:56.580 --> 08:57.580
No, there was, there was the reporter.

08:57.580 --> 09:03.860
Drew, Maggie, and the guy with the fork with the missing foot and Maggie and the guy that

09:03.860 --> 09:06.460
I don't know were the only two with their feet cut off.

09:06.460 --> 09:09.380
One foot cut off.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.580
Dorsey was just unconscious.

09:11.580 --> 09:15.800
I assume that Maggie and her foot cut off and the guy that she was with foot cut off

09:15.800 --> 09:20.940
were there when they walked in, but that guy did have a fork so he could have been eating

09:20.940 --> 09:24.140
his own foot and Maggie's foot.

09:24.140 --> 09:25.140
Gross.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.700
We should be able to match their dental records.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.700
Awesome.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.860
Really led the fire department's forensics.

09:31.860 --> 09:36.140
You guys should be able to match their dental records.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.580
Someone should be able to match their dental records.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.500
Hey, can't, hey man, you know, I know it's your dream and everything.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.620
Can you talk to us like a person?

09:44.620 --> 09:45.940
We lost our chief tonight.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.420
There's two more dead.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.580
Can you be real with me, Carl?

09:49.580 --> 09:53.860
Fucking just talk to me like, like Carl we all went to high school with.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.980
I am sorry for your loss.

09:56.980 --> 09:57.980
Oh, God damn it.

09:57.980 --> 10:01.580
Who's the best dentist in contention?

10:01.580 --> 10:05.140
Who's the only dentist in contention?

10:05.140 --> 10:06.140
You mean for the dental records?

10:06.140 --> 10:07.140
Dr. Teeth?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.140
Yeah, for the dental records.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.140
Is that how that works?

10:09.140 --> 10:10.140
I don't think it is.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.140
No.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.140
Well, actually, probably.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.140
Yeah, it probably is.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.140
You have to get him from a dentist.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.140
He's lying.

10:15.140 --> 10:16.140
You've got to find him at the dentist.

10:16.140 --> 10:19.140
Yeah, I mean, but for real though, how else would we do it in a small town like this?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.140
We're good cops.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.140
I'm a cop.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.020
Who is the dentist in contention?

10:23.020 --> 10:24.820
It would be, what's a good dentist name?

10:24.820 --> 10:25.820
Dr. Millare.

10:25.820 --> 10:26.820
Yeah, that's it.

10:26.820 --> 10:27.820
Dr. Millare.

10:27.820 --> 10:28.820
Yeah, Dr. Millare.

10:28.820 --> 10:33.820
When we came by here yesterday, I don't remember.

10:33.820 --> 10:34.820
Chief's Cruiser wasn't here.

10:34.820 --> 10:36.300
That's what I was going to get at.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.660
Was the Chief's Cruiser even here?

10:37.660 --> 10:38.660
No, no, no.

10:38.660 --> 10:39.660
She wasn't.

10:39.660 --> 10:40.660
Can I go through her cruiser?

10:40.660 --> 10:41.660
Good call.

10:41.660 --> 10:44.980
And I'm going to go through Drew's car, even though he's standing right over there.

10:44.980 --> 10:48.300
Yeah, give me just a second.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.300
I have to go pee.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.300
Cool.

10:51.300 --> 10:57.860
Okay, so there was a bullet hole in his head.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.180
Yeah, I missed that part.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.140
He was slumped over a plate of meat.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.140
Foot meat?

11:02.140 --> 11:06.660
Looking back now on it, I assume foot meat and both feet were in the skillet with meat

11:06.660 --> 11:07.660
picked off of them.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.260
Do you remember seeing a bunch of blood in like the kitchen or anything?

11:11.260 --> 11:13.260
Like were the floors covered in blood?

11:13.260 --> 11:18.660
From like the stab wounds, all over Maggie's face was blood and then from leaking out of

11:18.660 --> 11:19.660
their feet.

11:20.260 --> 11:23.900
Because if you had cooking feet and then also a foot miss and I just wondered if he was

11:23.900 --> 11:25.220
going back and forth or not.

11:25.220 --> 11:29.580
Yeah, well from what I could see, like what I slipped on was my own vomit and a bunch

11:29.580 --> 11:30.660
of puke.

11:30.660 --> 11:32.940
I mean a bunch of blood.

11:32.940 --> 11:33.940
And a bunch of puke.

11:33.940 --> 11:34.940
And your own puke.

11:34.940 --> 11:35.940
And my own puke.

11:35.940 --> 11:36.940
Oh god.

11:36.940 --> 11:39.460
There's a lot of bodily fluids in this scene.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.220
Hey Zach, congratulations.

11:41.220 --> 11:46.220
This is the first time since we've been roleplaying where I'm actually like legitimately grossed

11:46.220 --> 11:47.220
out and horrified.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.220
Yay!

11:48.740 --> 11:53.140
Right when we walked up and you said it was eating their feet, I was like, oh fuck no.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.140
Yeah.

11:54.140 --> 12:00.300
Dude, also this scene reminds me of that John Mulaney joke where he talks about, ew, gross,

12:00.300 --> 12:03.300
clean it up.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.540
There's hair, blood, and semen everywhere.

12:05.540 --> 12:06.540
Gross.

12:06.540 --> 12:07.540
Clean it up.

12:07.540 --> 12:11.420
Do you guys want to just jerk each other off for the next 20 minutes?

12:11.420 --> 12:12.740
Yeah, let's do that.

12:12.740 --> 12:13.740
We could play too.

12:13.740 --> 12:14.740
That'd be fine.

12:14.740 --> 12:15.740
Same difference.

12:15.740 --> 12:16.740
I can do one thing.

12:16.740 --> 12:18.620
Do we go clockwise or counterclockwise?

12:18.620 --> 12:19.620
What if we alternate?

12:19.620 --> 12:21.140
Like a couple pumps here.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.140
Dude.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.140
That doesn't work.

12:23.140 --> 12:24.140
Yeah, he gets.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.140
Let's pair off.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.140
I call Luke.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.140
No, no, no.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.140
I'm sitting by Luke.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.140
Guys.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.140
Okay.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.340
We were talking about the firefighter and then what?

12:32.340 --> 12:33.580
Oh, the dental records.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.780
Yeah, we were talking about how.

12:35.780 --> 12:39.900
You guys need to go to a vintage, you guys realize you need to go talk to the dentist

12:39.900 --> 12:40.900
maybe.

12:40.900 --> 12:41.900
Dr. Millar.

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
Dr. Millar.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.900
Dr. Millar.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
Dr. Millar.

12:44.900 --> 12:45.900
Dr. Millar.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.060
Real talk though.

12:47.060 --> 12:48.060
We got to go to bed.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.060
Like it's.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.060
Yeah.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.060
Yeah.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.060
I was, I was trying to.

12:52.060 --> 12:53.060
Yeah.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.060
Also the doctor is not going to be, he's going to be asleep right now.

12:54.060 --> 12:55.060
I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.060
Yeah.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.620
So we should probably go to sleep and then we can talk to Dr. Millar after we deal with

12:59.620 --> 13:00.620
the FBI.

13:00.620 --> 13:05.740
I really wanted to role play a guy in cocaine, but the situation was simply too somber.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.380
I didn't even think about that.

13:09.380 --> 13:14.100
But like also like it instantly, like just hearing about it made me so bummed like sober

13:14.100 --> 13:15.900
you up in real life.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.140
I've been treated.

13:17.140 --> 13:20.780
I'm not really, I didn't take any damage or anything that I got out of there.

13:20.780 --> 13:22.420
I was just kind of in shock for a minute.

13:22.420 --> 13:26.040
So yeah, maybe the like, uh, your eyebrows smell weird.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.260
Maybe I don't have eyebrows anymore.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.460
I don't have eyebrows anymore.

13:32.460 --> 13:33.460
False eyebrows.

13:33.460 --> 13:35.180
Strong character choice.

13:35.180 --> 13:39.980
As Keith Vigna, I would love to go to my bed and fall asleep.

13:39.980 --> 13:40.980
Yeah.

13:40.980 --> 13:41.980
It seems good.

13:41.980 --> 13:42.980
Same.

13:42.980 --> 13:43.980
I'm going to go home.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.340
Do a search on the charred remains of the chief's house.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.740
And also were you, you tried to get into her car.

13:50.740 --> 13:51.740
You couldn't.

13:51.740 --> 13:52.740
Oh, that's where we left off.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.740
Yep.

13:53.740 --> 13:54.740
Good one.

13:54.740 --> 13:55.740
Good.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.740
Boom.

13:56.740 --> 14:00.500
Clark, you go and check the chief's cruiser and it is clean.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.420
There is nothing inside of it.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.460
Not even a steering wheel or seats.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.820
Not even a steering wheel or seats.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.420
No, there are those things.

14:08.420 --> 14:14.020
There is however, no detritus or any other information.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.440
Can I look in the glove box?

14:15.440 --> 14:17.000
You look in the glove box.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
It is empty.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Weirdly enough.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.500
Does she have a dash cam?

14:20.500 --> 14:24.780
She has a dash cam on the cruiser and it has been unhooked.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.940
I want to open up the computer that all cop cars have.

14:28.940 --> 14:30.740
Yes, you do that.

14:30.740 --> 14:36.820
Can I get any information from that voice comes over the computer.

14:36.820 --> 14:37.820
Hello computer.

14:38.820 --> 14:39.820
State your query.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.860
Where was this car earlier today?

14:41.860 --> 14:43.740
Examining records.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.820
It was at the mill on the other side of the city.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.580
This car was at the mill on the other side of the city.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.260
How long was it there cop computer?

14:51.260 --> 14:53.420
Since the evening of December 1st.

14:53.420 --> 14:56.180
Three days since the evening of December 1st.

14:56.180 --> 14:57.180
Is that right?

14:57.180 --> 14:58.180
Three days.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.180
That's right.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.820
I mean, it's like the evening of December.

15:01.820 --> 15:06.020
It's like two, two and a bit, two days and a couple hours.

15:06.020 --> 15:08.860
You know, like two and a few.

15:08.860 --> 15:11.020
Is what the computer says back to you.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.020
Excellent.

15:12.020 --> 15:13.020
Thank you cop computer.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.020
Cop net.

15:14.020 --> 15:15.020
Cop net.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.020
Thank you cop net.

15:16.020 --> 15:19.020
You're welcome officer Bishop.

15:19.020 --> 15:24.260
Okay.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.260
What is love?

15:25.260 --> 15:26.260
Officer Bishop.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.260
I close it.

15:29.260 --> 15:33.060
Clark doesn't know.

15:33.060 --> 15:36.340
Clark starts to weep.

15:36.340 --> 15:37.340
I go back to you guys.

15:37.340 --> 15:38.540
I'm going home to go to sleep.

15:38.540 --> 15:53.060
I just, I just talked to the cop net and, uh, what, what is cop net?

15:53.060 --> 15:55.820
You know, the, uh, the computer we talked to in our cars.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.020
Clark, what are you talking?

15:57.020 --> 15:59.740
Wait, we have a computer in our cars, buddy.

15:59.740 --> 16:00.740
I think you need some rest.

16:00.740 --> 16:02.620
I'm just so sleepy.

16:03.180 --> 16:04.180
You know, cop net.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.180
No, I don't.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.700
He said he sounds like this cop, cop net.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.460
Turns out that Maggie's car has been up at the mill for the last couple of days.

16:11.460 --> 16:16.100
In fact, I think it's where she went after she left the station after I gave her her

16:16.100 --> 16:17.100
present.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
Yeah.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.100
This was all your fault.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.100
Hmm.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.100
Forget about that.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.100
What's at the mill.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.100
I don't know.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.100
I think that's something we need to investigate tomorrow.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.100
Tomorrow.

16:25.100 --> 16:26.100
Some grist.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.820
I opened my computer up, look at it and I'm like, wow, I guess I do have computer in here.

16:29.820 --> 16:32.020
I shut it and I drive home.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.020
I'm driving home too.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.020
Okay.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.020
If you guys could both leave.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.020
Oh, glad I got that one out of the way.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.020
99.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.020
95.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.020
Woo.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.020
That's a bad roll.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.020
It's a bad roll.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.020
Hey, I'd like to search that house.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.020
Cool.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.060
And you are super hopped up currently.

16:56.100 --> 17:05.540
So you decide to grab, I see John going to the back of his car and pulling out a bunch

17:05.540 --> 17:13.700
of evidence bags and then carrying them toward the burning embers of this house to collect

17:13.700 --> 17:15.540
evidence in these bags.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.260
Do you?

17:17.260 --> 17:19.260
That's what I'm picturing currently.

17:19.260 --> 17:20.260
Okay.

17:20.260 --> 17:21.260
What do you picture?

17:21.460 --> 17:25.700
I'm always picturing more just a stroll through the house, you know, through the wreckage

17:25.700 --> 17:28.380
to try to find anything of significance.

17:28.380 --> 17:33.820
This was a brick home and the exterior walls are still in place.

17:33.820 --> 17:34.820
Sure.

17:34.820 --> 17:35.820
Mostly.

17:35.820 --> 17:42.100
The explosion took out a lot of the brick from the back of the house where the explosion

17:42.100 --> 17:49.860
seems to have come from and the roof has been blown off and the insides are completely melted

17:49.860 --> 17:54.820
and charred, but the structure itself still slightly stands.

17:54.820 --> 17:58.480
The structure itself still slightly stands.

17:58.480 --> 17:59.480
One thing for sure.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.480
This was a house.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.480
Nailed it.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.380
You can never know if this house was a home.

18:03.380 --> 18:07.340
What kind of evidence are you wanting to acquire?

18:07.340 --> 18:10.400
I was mostly just hoping to do a search roll.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.980
Go ahead and roll that search roll for me.

18:12.980 --> 18:13.980
Eight.

18:13.980 --> 18:14.980
Zero eight?

18:14.980 --> 18:15.980
Yep.

18:15.980 --> 18:16.980
All right.

18:16.980 --> 18:17.980
Awesome.

18:17.980 --> 18:18.980
All right.

18:18.980 --> 18:19.980
Awesome.

18:19.980 --> 18:26.460
So as you go through, you can collect the burnt remains of three bodies.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.700
I bet we'd have some coroners for that.

18:29.700 --> 18:33.020
Seems like a medical examiner.

18:33.020 --> 18:36.740
I don't know if they'd just let me, even as a cop, if they'd just let me be here on my

18:36.740 --> 18:39.660
own poking around like bagging up bodies.

18:39.660 --> 18:44.720
The county coroner is walking with you as you go through it all.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.060
What is their name?

18:46.060 --> 18:47.060
Her name is Sheila.

18:47.140 --> 18:48.140
Is she Australian?

18:48.140 --> 18:49.140
Yeah.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.060
I mean, she hates this.

18:51.060 --> 18:52.060
She's not happy.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.260
She got called at like two in the morning.

18:54.260 --> 18:58.420
Hey, come to contention, this town that you have to drive like 45 minutes to.

18:58.420 --> 18:59.420
Oh, she's from the city?

18:59.420 --> 19:00.420
Yeah.

19:00.420 --> 19:01.420
Yeah.

19:01.420 --> 19:02.420
That makes sense.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.980
She booked her way over here and she's dreary.

19:04.980 --> 19:12.460
She's weary eyed and upset and helping you collect the evidence of these three charred

19:12.460 --> 19:14.020
remains of bodies.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.500
Sheila, in your...

19:15.500 --> 19:16.500
Sorry.

19:16.940 --> 19:20.020
In your medical opinion, how would you say these folks died?

19:20.020 --> 19:21.020
Burned.

19:21.020 --> 19:26.340
I don't want to be inappropriate like with you, but the Australian accent is truly beautiful.

19:26.340 --> 19:27.780
Your husband must be a lucky man.

19:27.780 --> 19:28.780
He is.

19:28.780 --> 19:29.780
All right.

19:29.780 --> 19:30.780
You want to help me pick up these bones?

19:30.780 --> 19:33.140
Yes.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.860
She begins collecting bones.

19:34.860 --> 19:35.860
Okay.

19:35.860 --> 19:36.860
All right.

19:36.860 --> 19:37.860
Simply breathtaking.

19:37.860 --> 19:38.860
Help.

19:38.860 --> 19:39.860
There's more over here.

19:39.860 --> 19:40.860
Okay.

19:40.860 --> 19:43.700
I think you got that then there Sheila.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.180
I don't think you're really Australian.

19:47.180 --> 19:54.220
You can actually find the pistol that was in the hand of the man in the kitchen.

19:54.220 --> 19:55.220
Okay.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.220
I bagged that up.

19:56.220 --> 19:59.980
And you can find the knife that was in the hand of Chief Maggie Cook.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.380
The knife was in her hand.

20:01.380 --> 20:04.780
She had a large chef's knife in her left hand.

20:04.780 --> 20:05.780
Okay.

20:05.780 --> 20:10.660
Well, basically I want to see if that matches the stab wounds on her face.

20:10.660 --> 20:11.660
Okay.

20:11.660 --> 20:20.100
And you can also find lots of gas cans, metal gas cans are strewn.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.700
There are probably seven of them.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.700
Okay.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.900
The knife, well, roll forensics for me.

20:25.900 --> 20:29.460
I mean, I would like to, I guess, send that off, but I can, I'll do it.

20:29.460 --> 20:30.460
For now.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.460
I'll just hold it up to the-

20:31.460 --> 20:32.460
Yep.

20:32.460 --> 20:33.460
That's hold it up to the holes.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.260
To the holes in the skull.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.580
That's a, wow.

20:37.580 --> 20:38.580
That's a crit fail.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.580
All right.

20:39.580 --> 20:42.100
What does a crit fail on a forensics test look like?

20:42.100 --> 20:50.540
You slip and you shove the knife into the burnt skull of Chief Maggie Cook and you accidentally

20:50.540 --> 20:56.780
rifle around and a lot of her face and skull disintegrate onto itself.

20:56.780 --> 20:57.780
Oh shit.

20:57.780 --> 21:03.700
So you might not be able to get super accurate results back from that.

21:03.700 --> 21:08.700
And Sheila says, what are you doing over there?

21:08.700 --> 21:12.180
I didn't want to do that.

21:12.180 --> 21:20.740
Now you know how Keith fucks up all the rolls, I just have you one on one.

21:20.740 --> 21:21.740
I can make whatever-

21:21.740 --> 21:25.420
The other thing though is that I did not want to wiggle the knife around in her skull, can

21:25.420 --> 21:26.420
we?

21:26.420 --> 21:30.660
Like, that's not what I'm trying to do here.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.740
That was funny, but can we wreck on that?

21:32.740 --> 21:36.980
I'll take every crit failure as strongly as I possibly can.

21:36.980 --> 21:45.140
I know that, but it just seems disrespectful to destroy the Chief's face.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.780
That's not what I was about.

21:47.780 --> 21:48.980
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

21:48.980 --> 21:51.740
Is this a knife?

21:51.740 --> 21:56.100
While poking through all this stuff and then severely fucking up the corpse of your former

21:56.100 --> 21:57.100
boss.

21:57.100 --> 22:01.980
Oh, God damn it, that's a 99.

22:01.980 --> 22:02.980
That's a crit fail.

22:02.980 --> 22:03.980
Okay, awesome.

22:03.980 --> 22:09.620
Go ahead and lose three sanity automatically, which puts you at 40.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.620
Yes.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.340
Is there anything else that you wanted to do?

22:13.340 --> 22:15.220
No, I think I've done enough here.

22:15.220 --> 22:16.220
Couldn't agree more.

22:16.220 --> 22:19.020
So go ahead and roll alertness for me real quick.

22:19.020 --> 22:20.020
95.

22:20.020 --> 22:21.620
On a 100.

22:21.620 --> 22:22.620
So congratulations.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.340
No, it's on a 16.

22:24.340 --> 22:28.540
Okay, you don't notice the thing that you would have noticed?

22:28.540 --> 22:31.860
Your search check was for inside the house, which you succeeded on, so you got everything

22:31.860 --> 22:37.380
inside the house, but the alertness check was for something that's totally fair.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.380
Very different.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.380
Okay.

22:39.380 --> 22:42.500
Wish I hadn't destroyed the Chief's face.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.940
I bet it'll be fine.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.620
That image is going to stay with me.

22:46.620 --> 22:50.780
Just digging around in there as it completely falls apart.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.060
Okay, so I don't know.

22:53.060 --> 22:56.100
I mean, yeah, I'll go home and put that stuff away.

22:56.340 --> 23:02.500
Okay, so you finish putting everything into the house and get the trailer that you used

23:02.500 --> 23:04.900
ready to take back in the morning.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.820
And then you go inside and...

23:06.820 --> 23:12.220
Yeah, I'm going to jack off and, I don't know, maybe throw on some ancient aliens.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.940
That should help get you to sleep.

23:14.940 --> 23:17.420
So you're not going to be able to fall asleep for too long tonight.

23:17.420 --> 23:22.960
In fact, I'm going to have you roll power in order to get even a decent night's rest.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.860
So roll against your POW.

23:25.420 --> 23:26.420
Crit success.

23:26.420 --> 23:27.420
Nice.

23:27.420 --> 23:32.100
Then you're going to be able to force your cocaine-addled mind right to sleep.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.420
The Pennymores are famously clear of mind.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.460
You're laying in bed.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.100
Your eyes close.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.100
Zach, I'm right here.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.100
Zach, no, no, no.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.100
I'm right here.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.100
Wake up, buddy.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.100
I'm right here.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.860
Not for the podcast, that's for us.

23:54.860 --> 23:55.860
That was a dumb joke.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.860
You're trying to do something serious instead of mood.

23:57.860 --> 23:59.740
And I was just like, so anyway.

23:59.740 --> 24:00.740
You come to...

24:00.740 --> 24:01.740
Edit point.

24:04.100 --> 24:10.020
You come to and the sky is dark, but the ground begins to give light to the world.

24:10.020 --> 24:16.900
You see a man in the distance with his head and hands in stocks that sit on an inky black

24:16.900 --> 24:18.520
stage.

24:18.520 --> 24:23.340
As you walk toward this man, the ground becomes wider and wider like a screen's brightness

24:23.340 --> 24:26.620
level being gradually turned up.

24:26.620 --> 24:32.080
You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around, you see your mother.

24:32.080 --> 24:37.040
She looks like she did when she was about your age and she is crying.

24:37.040 --> 24:45.320
She looks past you and a door appears in between you, but you can hear her say, I'm so sorry.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.760
He's just so beautiful.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.140
You don't have to do this.

24:48.140 --> 24:49.260
We can leave.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.860
We can run.

24:50.860 --> 24:56.700
The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk.

24:56.700 --> 25:01.300
You locked up in the police department with the woman's split head atop the black putrid

25:01.300 --> 25:02.980
hacked up anatomy.

25:02.980 --> 25:08.700
You turn around and you are face to face with the man in the stocks, John Peters, his forehead

25:08.700 --> 25:13.400
burned and peeling with the word fool desperate.

25:13.400 --> 25:19.760
His eyes widen and he whispers, please, it's coming.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.920
They cannot stop it.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.620
They are playing the roles of greater men.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.800
You have to save everyone.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.640
It is coming.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.600
What's coming, John, what's coming?

25:31.600 --> 25:36.000
You hear a rumble in the distance as you wake up in bed.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.880
Oh, another good night's sleep.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.340
You know, I never, I never remember my dreams.

25:41.340 --> 25:44.540
You actually get a D four back on willpower.

25:44.540 --> 25:48.460
That's a two hello world.

25:48.460 --> 25:53.620
And uh, you're heading to the station to meet up with, um, your partners as well as the

25:53.620 --> 26:02.940
FBI.

26:02.940 --> 26:10.520
Joe Clark makes it back to his home where he is almost finished unloading all the stuff

26:10.520 --> 26:15.540
into his house and upon finishing it, I assume you're going to skip the wheel of fortune

26:15.540 --> 26:17.280
tonight and go straight to bed.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.160
Probably no, no dinner even.

26:19.160 --> 26:27.120
So as you fall asleep in bed, you're walking through a parking lot and you look down and

26:27.120 --> 26:33.220
you see you are carrying a piece of old parchment that is rolled up with a neat little string

26:33.220 --> 26:35.160
tied tightly around it.

26:35.160 --> 26:40.060
Looking up, you hand it to the cashier of your local grocery store.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.220
You like this guy.

26:41.220 --> 26:44.380
He's trying to scan the role, but it's not beeping.

26:44.380 --> 26:48.900
He looks at you as he chuckles up, this is going to cost you greatly.

26:48.900 --> 26:53.180
As you walk out of the grocery store, you step into the sanctuary of a church during

26:53.180 --> 27:01.020
a funeral, a young boy with an enormous forehead and the darkest eyes you've seen is walking

27:01.020 --> 27:07.740
up to you and tears are streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes.

27:07.740 --> 27:16.140
You hear a small voice inside you that says, please, sir, as the crying boy holds out his

27:16.140 --> 27:17.140
hands.

27:17.140 --> 27:18.140
Do I still have the parchment?

27:18.140 --> 27:19.140
Yeah.

27:19.140 --> 27:20.140
Can I unroll the parchment?

27:20.140 --> 27:21.140
Yeah.

27:21.140 --> 27:26.180
As you unroll it, the young boy looks up and he reaches for it and you begin to hear cries

27:26.180 --> 27:31.200
throughout the sanctuary you are standing in and as you look around, the congregation

27:31.200 --> 27:35.980
is trying to run away, but they are melting into the floor.

27:35.980 --> 27:39.780
You look down and you too are melting into the floor.

27:39.780 --> 27:45.300
When you look up, the boy has been replaced by Tildy B. Mitchell, who looks down at you

27:45.300 --> 27:48.420
with her finger pointed at you like a gun.

27:48.420 --> 27:56.260
She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor.

27:56.260 --> 28:04.080
As your eyes look to the ceiling of the chapel, you hear a voice inside you say, let go.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.320
As you wake up in bed.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.840
In the dream, I never got a good look at the parchment as I was unrolling it.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.840
Okay.

28:11.840 --> 28:12.840
Okay.

28:12.840 --> 28:25.620
So John, when you wake up, I'm going to have you normally on each day.

28:25.620 --> 28:33.080
This is when we would do our dealings with the disorder that you have picked up.

28:33.080 --> 28:40.520
So each day, basically we're going to look back at the past day and say, Thomas, did

28:40.520 --> 28:46.880
John Lee Pettymore actively choose to avoid any threats or chances to save people?

28:46.880 --> 28:47.880
And you didn't.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.320
So you don't take any willpower damage.

28:50.320 --> 28:56.200
Each day that you do avoid one of those things, the next day you'll take a D6 hit to your

28:56.200 --> 28:58.080
willpower when you wake up.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.600
And for each day that you continually do that, it doubles or sorry, it doesn't double.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.880
It just adds a D6 every time.

29:04.880 --> 29:12.140
So as long as you continue to not avoid threats or chances to save people, you'll be fine.

29:12.140 --> 29:19.080
When John wakes up, however, he has a text from Drew.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.700
What does that say?

29:20.700 --> 29:23.440
Text from Drew.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.900
Clark came by last night when no one is at the station.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.040
He warned me not to go to the chief's house.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.240
He was limping, but he wasn't limping later.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.360
What is going on?

29:31.360 --> 29:33.800
And where is all the cake?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.640
I text him back.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.720
I ask him where he is right now.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.780
Did he go to the hospital after?

29:39.780 --> 29:41.480
Was he injured at chief's house?

29:41.480 --> 29:42.480
No.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.480
Okay.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.840
I ask him where he is now and I tell him that the cake is safe.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.840
All right.

29:46.840 --> 29:47.840
Sounds good.

29:47.840 --> 29:52.740
He'll send you a text back as you're getting ready and say, I'm already at the station.

29:52.740 --> 29:58.840
If we were really organizing like a multimillion dollar drug deal, like Drew is the sweet,

29:58.840 --> 30:03.320
like what a sweet way to address that at the end of a text, like, Hey, by the way,

30:03.320 --> 30:05.160
where's all the drugs?

30:05.160 --> 30:09.400
No, Hey, don't, I, you know, I know you got a lot on your plate.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.400
Don't worry about it.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.600
But by the way, uh, where's all the cake?

30:12.600 --> 30:13.600
He's super nice.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
He is.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.600
Yeah.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.600
I guess.

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
I don't know.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.600
He has Coke contacts.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.600
He can't.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.600
Maybe.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.840
Maybe.

30:21.840 --> 30:22.840
So I text him.

30:22.840 --> 30:23.840
Yeah.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.680
That, that the cake is safe and where is he?

30:26.680 --> 30:27.680
Okay.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.680
Yeah.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.440
He'll, he'll respond and tell you that he's already at the station.

30:31.440 --> 30:32.440
What time is it?

30:32.440 --> 30:33.440
Eight.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.440
Sure.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.440
Seven.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.440
Doesn't matter.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.440
Six.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.440
Nope.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.440
It's eight.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.440
Yeah.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.440
Okay.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.440
Seven 30.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.440
It's eight o'clock.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.440
Okay.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.440
Doesn't matter.

30:45.440 --> 30:46.440
You ready?

30:46.440 --> 30:47.440
It's just a, it's really essential for me to get into that head space.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.440
You know, like what time is it?

30:48.440 --> 30:49.440
Is it seven 45?

30:49.440 --> 30:50.440
Is it eight, eight 15?

30:50.440 --> 30:51.440
How stressed should I be?

30:51.440 --> 30:54.440
I got to think about the light, how it's acting up.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.480
A lot goes into my role play decisions.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.480
I appreciate that.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.280
Oh, absolutely.

31:00.280 --> 31:07.880
It's definitely a lot of planning and uh, I like to inhabit a character, you know, not

31:07.880 --> 31:12.480
just fly by the cuff of my like a cuff of my seat, the seat of my, okay.

31:12.480 --> 31:14.480
The seat of your tight pants.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.480
Yeah.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.480
Let's not include any of this.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.480
All right, Luke.

31:29.480 --> 31:37.080
So your disorder is that you have to actively lie about things to make you sound better.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.080
Yes.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.080
You didn't do that yesterday.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.080
I haven't been doing that.

31:40.080 --> 31:46.580
Uh, so you're going to start off today with one D six willpower damage and for each day

31:46.580 --> 31:51.280
that you continue to not lie to make yourself sound better, it's going to be an extra D

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
six daily.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.280
Okay.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.280
Do I have to lie?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.280
Yeah.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.280
Okay.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.080
That's five.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.080
Five willpower.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.080
Okay.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.080
So that brings me down.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.080
Starting at two.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
Yeah.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.080
What happens if I go to zero?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.080
I die.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.880
I lose the will to live.

32:08.880 --> 32:15.480
So at one or two willpower, we're going to learn now you are having an emotional breakdown

32:15.480 --> 32:20.680
and that is going to cause a negative 20% to all of your roles for the day.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.680
Yeah.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.980
Oh, that's just what Keith needs.

32:24.980 --> 32:28.780
When you hit zero, uh, no tests can succeed.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.180
Uh, and I take control whenever I want of your character.

32:33.180 --> 32:34.180
Okay.

32:34.180 --> 32:36.580
How can I gain willpower back other than sleeping?

32:36.580 --> 32:40.080
You can do stimulants to focus.

32:40.080 --> 32:46.580
And for each upper that you take, it will negate the negative 20% to your roles for

32:46.580 --> 32:48.320
one D six hours.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.980
And what's the negative consequences of that?

32:51.980 --> 32:58.580
Well, if you use stimulants too often, they become addictive and your body will be at

32:58.580 --> 33:00.980
a negative 20% without their use.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.580
Is there a way to get over that addiction?

33:03.580 --> 33:04.580
Yeah.

33:04.580 --> 33:05.580
Rehab.

33:05.580 --> 33:09.280
How long in game is that?

33:09.280 --> 33:12.180
We will get there if we get there.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.180
Okay.

33:13.180 --> 33:14.180
Sounds good.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.180
Shit.

33:15.180 --> 33:18.740
Looks like I'm going to break into the stash today.

33:18.740 --> 33:23.940
So do you want to, uh, I mean, do you want to try to find anything to make yourself feel,

33:23.940 --> 33:25.740
but you've wake up feeling like shit.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.740
Yeah.

33:26.740 --> 33:28.740
I mean, would coffee count?

33:28.740 --> 33:29.740
No.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.740
I didn't think so.

33:31.740 --> 33:36.040
Um, yeah, I probably am going to have to, I'm going to do the only stimulant that I

33:36.040 --> 33:41.740
know is easily available to Keith, which is the cocaine, the mounds of cocaine that we

33:41.740 --> 33:42.740
have.

33:42.740 --> 33:43.740
Yes.

33:43.740 --> 33:45.540
And it is all out at, uh, John's house.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.960
It is all out at John's house.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.560
He might have some on him.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.560
Who knows?

33:50.560 --> 33:54.000
So I wake up, I guess I'm going to give John a ring.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
What time is it right now?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.560
Oh, it's like eight in the morning.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.560
Okay.

33:57.560 --> 33:58.560
Yeah.

33:58.560 --> 34:04.560
I want to give John a ring or a text or whatever and say, Hey, can you bring some stimulants

34:04.560 --> 34:06.560
with you?

34:06.560 --> 34:07.560
Okay.

34:07.560 --> 34:08.560
Okay.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.560
Sounds good.

34:09.560 --> 34:17.560
Cool.

34:17.560 --> 34:23.160
So yesterday you did actively hurt a few people.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.160
Yeah.

34:24.160 --> 34:28.760
I believe you shot the woman in the, in the hand at least once and then in her chest multiple

34:28.760 --> 34:29.760
times.

34:29.760 --> 34:30.760
A lot.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.200
Um, the woman at the hotel motel.

34:34.200 --> 34:38.960
And that means that you, when you wake up this morning, don't have to take any willpower

34:38.960 --> 34:44.760
damage to begin the day because your disorder is in control of you.

34:44.760 --> 34:49.160
So you only actively lose willpower when you wake up.

34:49.160 --> 34:53.240
If you are refraining from giving into the power of your disorder.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.240
Yep.

34:54.240 --> 34:55.240
Right.

34:55.240 --> 34:56.240
Okay.

34:56.240 --> 35:01.360
So when you wake up, you, uh, I think you are actually at 10 out of 12 willpower points.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.240
So you're feeling pretty all right.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.240
I indeed slept.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.240
All right.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.960
So, uh, when you get up, didn't sleep all right.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.760
Yeah.

35:45.760 --> 35:45.760
