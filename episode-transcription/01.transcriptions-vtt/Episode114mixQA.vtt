00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
Salutations, my fellow interdimensional friends.

00:04.120 --> 00:07.760
It's your time and space traveling trash sommelier,

00:07.760 --> 00:09.240
Wolf the dog.

00:09.240 --> 00:14.240
And I'm live from somewhere, some time,

00:14.440 --> 00:19.400
but probably still from 694.2, maybe?

00:19.400 --> 00:22.720
Listen, I don't know where the fuck I am right now.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.400
It's somehow both dark and bright

00:25.400 --> 00:29.520
and there is everything and nothing all at once.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.960
There's also a possum wearing a cowboy hat.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.680
His name is Jeremy.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.180
Uh, anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf

00:39.180 --> 00:43.200
is from Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.680
Who got Wolf here reading an ad copy

00:45.680 --> 00:47.780
all because they tweeted about the show

00:47.780 --> 00:50.280
and tagged at Pretending Pod,

00:50.280 --> 00:53.840
a smart business decision in this cutthroat business

00:53.840 --> 00:56.080
of dead folk parlors?

00:56.080 --> 00:57.440
They right.

00:57.440 --> 01:01.080
Ever wondered what to do with your dead friends and family?

01:01.080 --> 01:04.160
Here at Newman's Necromorium Funeral Home,

01:04.160 --> 01:06.320
we take the wonder out of death.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.240
For an astronomical and non-negotiable

01:09.240 --> 01:10.840
price of our choosing,

01:10.840 --> 01:14.040
you won't have to worry about the finer details.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.280
Still not sure?

01:15.280 --> 01:16.520
Meet Stu.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.960
Stu says, the dead make great listeners.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.180
Except Lewis.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.960
That guy keeps screaming that he just wants to go home

01:23.960 --> 01:25.960
and there's been a terrible mistake.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.840
Classic Lewis, now that you sold on the idea,

01:29.840 --> 01:31.640
let us handle you dead.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.680
We'll even wear gloves.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.680
Well damn, thanks Newman.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.080
I would advise you to not listen

01:38.080 --> 01:40.480
to the screams of Classic Lewis.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.480
Every Lewis I've ever known has been a lie and a cheat.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.280
This one is probably no exception.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.540
And every Lewis is also a rat bastard.

01:50.540 --> 01:54.000
But especially a Lewis named Classic Lewis.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.280
Remember, if you want to write up something

01:56.280 --> 01:59.240
for your wolf to howl, tag at Pretending Pod

01:59.240 --> 02:00.960
on Twitter or Instagram.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.760
Or write up a five star review on the Apple Podcasts.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.280
Huge shout out to a concerned observer,

02:07.280 --> 02:12.000
Lobster Memories and Huge Earn for writing reviews.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.780
It makes this interdimensional traveling little wolfie

02:15.780 --> 02:17.560
so gosh darn happy.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.480
And if you want to meet other listeners,

02:19.480 --> 02:22.680
AKA super rad weirdos like yourself,

02:22.680 --> 02:24.400
check out the link to Discord

02:24.400 --> 02:26.520
and the subreddit in the show notes.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.480
Our community isn't big enough yet to be toxic

02:29.480 --> 02:31.580
and it's a real good time to hang out.

02:31.580 --> 02:34.940
Honestly, I'm just there for the memes and pet pics.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.960
But there's a good amount of role play chat as well.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.600
Or maybe you want to put together a one shot

02:41.600 --> 02:43.800
with a group of other listeners.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.160
Bubble gum tree my babies.

02:46.160 --> 02:51.120
The links, as always, are in the damn show notes.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.080
And not to be weird about it,

02:53.080 --> 02:55.960
but if you've listened to the entire first season

02:55.960 --> 02:58.200
of Pretending to be People

02:58.200 --> 03:01.400
and you've been considering joining the Patreon

03:01.400 --> 03:02.760
but you've never done it,

03:02.760 --> 03:06.200
the link to the Patreon's in the show notes.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.120
It's worth it.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.740
And apologies to the PTBP crew

03:09.740 --> 03:12.220
for letting you in on this little secret.

03:12.220 --> 03:15.840
But you can actually sign up for like five bucks.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.720
Then listen to all the bonus episodes in a matter of days.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.920
Then delete your pledge.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.060
They can't stop you.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.280
Is it cooler to just let it ride

03:26.280 --> 03:29.940
and support the creative dreams of some small town weirdos

03:29.940 --> 03:31.860
that you really like to listen to?

03:31.860 --> 03:36.360
No, it's obviously cooler to rip these dumb idiots off.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.460
But you do whatever feels right.

03:38.460 --> 03:40.600
I heard they just finished up another arc

03:40.600 --> 03:44.560
of a 13 episode long mostly homebrew campaign.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.080
And the 26th episode is a session zero

03:48.120 --> 03:51.120
for the upcoming run of Control Copy,

03:51.120 --> 03:54.220
a Delta Green scenario by Dennis Detwiller

03:54.220 --> 03:59.220
chosen by a poll over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.440
The link's in the show notes as I have mentioned many times

04:03.440 --> 04:05.600
but you can probably remember it.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.760
It's just patreon.com slash pretending pod.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.240
Sign up for the Circle of Knowledge shirt club

04:11.240 --> 04:14.520
before Halloween and you can receive an exclusive shirt

04:14.520 --> 04:16.600
a whole month sooner.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.320
And check out the YouTube channel.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.440
The composer, some freak named Justin,

04:22.440 --> 04:25.800
continues to slowly upload tracks from the show

04:25.800 --> 04:29.800
onto the ultimate TTRPG playlist.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.880
Guess what that damn link is, you freaks?

04:32.880 --> 04:35.940
Also in the show notes, you can find a link

04:35.940 --> 04:39.480
to a music video for this hot new track.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.600
It's Kudzu with no backbone.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.760
So.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
It's Q&A time.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.240
It's Q&A time.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.080
Hell yeah.

05:16.080 --> 05:16.920
Whoa.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.560
The season is done.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.040
The season is over

05:20.040 --> 05:22.400
and it's time to answer questions about the season.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.820
Now we get to find out what happened.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.420
Yeah, in some ways,

05:26.420 --> 05:30.840
I like to think that most of the questions

05:30.840 --> 05:33.840
as far as what actually happened have been answered.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.120
Although, I understand

05:40.000 --> 05:41.260
that that's not the case

05:41.780 --> 05:42.620
and that's okay.

05:42.620 --> 05:46.460
Dude, today a coworker of mine asked me for my phone number

05:46.460 --> 05:49.180
so that they could send me a playlist.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.380
And what are the seven,

05:51.380 --> 05:53.100
not 10 numbers that you told me?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.820
No, I won't be saying that.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.820
He sent me this playlist.

05:58.820 --> 05:59.780
Oh, hell yes.

05:59.780 --> 06:01.180
And it had,

06:01.180 --> 06:04.580
what's the band that sings Radioactive?

06:04.580 --> 06:06.420
Oh, is that Imagine Dragons?

06:06.420 --> 06:08.820
Imagine Dragon Deez Nuts Across Your Face.

06:08.820 --> 06:09.660
Oh, no.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.100
I kept wanting to tell it,

06:19.100 --> 06:22.080
but I was like, wait until we're recording.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.980
We've been hanging out for a while

06:25.980 --> 06:28.940
and I'm not sure I've ever been more proud of you

06:28.940 --> 06:30.020
that you held onto that.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.700
I feel like I got hit by a train.

06:34.580 --> 06:35.500
I did get,

06:36.620 --> 06:37.980
I got Joe with a-

06:37.980 --> 06:39.460
He got me before we started recording

06:39.460 --> 06:40.820
with such a genuine one.

06:40.820 --> 06:41.660
I was like-

06:41.660 --> 06:43.520
It was really good and I was like,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.340
oh, you should have saved it for the pod.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.180
I didn't even see that coming.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.180
I had another one.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.540
I straight up don't,

06:48.540 --> 06:49.900
I don't know if I was in here,

06:49.900 --> 06:50.740
if I wasn't listening.

06:50.740 --> 06:51.580
You were not.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.480
But it was a,

06:52.480 --> 06:53.320
dude,

06:53.320 --> 06:54.160
I just like,

06:54.160 --> 06:56.260
it was like both of us looking at our phones.

06:56.260 --> 06:57.100
I was like,

06:57.100 --> 06:58.900
dude, did you see that thing about the article

06:58.900 --> 07:00.380
about Cho Ken today?

07:00.380 --> 07:01.460
And I went,

07:01.460 --> 07:03.300
Cho Ken?

07:03.300 --> 07:04.140
Oh my God.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.380
Yeah, Cho Ken on Deez Nuts.

07:06.380 --> 07:07.220
Jesus.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.780
I was so genuinely,

07:08.780 --> 07:10.140
I have not heard about this.

07:10.140 --> 07:10.980
Please tell me.

07:10.980 --> 07:11.820
You're like, who's Cho Ken?

07:13.580 --> 07:14.420
My

07:14.420 --> 07:15.260
God.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.740
Anyway,

07:19.020 --> 07:19.940
that was good.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.880
Yeah.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.720
Proud of you.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.540
I think that's enough.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.780
We have enough questions for that to be

07:27.140 --> 07:28.380
our jumping off point.

07:28.380 --> 07:29.740
So let's dive into these.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.980
I'm gonna go ahead and start

07:30.980 --> 07:33.740
with a question here from me.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.420
I'm Zach and I have a question.

07:36.420 --> 07:37.820
We asked for questions,

07:37.820 --> 07:40.980
comments or compliments on Twitter and Reddit and

07:40.980 --> 07:42.820
Zach felt he didn't get enough compliments.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.660
So.

07:44.620 --> 07:45.960
So I'm gonna start this thing off

07:45.960 --> 07:47.280
by complimenting myself.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.360
Zach,

07:48.360 --> 07:50.040
I don't say this a lot,

07:50.040 --> 07:50.880
but

07:52.120 --> 07:54.460
you actually finished a thing.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.300
Good job, man.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.120
That's huge, dude.

07:56.120 --> 07:56.960
Yeah.

07:57.820 --> 07:58.660
All right.

07:58.660 --> 07:59.500
That was genuine.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.500
And I didn't expect to

08:01.500 --> 08:05.600
negate my horrible self-talk to myself,

08:06.660 --> 08:07.540
but here we are.

08:07.540 --> 08:10.500
And so I do have a compliment right off the bat

08:10.500 --> 08:12.460
for the three of you,

08:12.460 --> 08:13.580
each of you.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.400
Joe,

08:14.400 --> 08:15.820
I'll start with you as it's-

08:15.820 --> 08:17.740
Oh, literally individually.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.220
Do you also have one for the group?

08:19.220 --> 08:21.780
I literally didn't plan this at all.

08:21.780 --> 08:24.460
I am not looking at anything.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.840
I didn't have these planned,

08:25.840 --> 08:28.260
but I have a compliment for each of you.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.100
Joe,

08:29.100 --> 08:32.620
having you as a player makes my job

08:32.620 --> 08:34.660
as a GM more fun.

08:34.660 --> 08:35.500
Dope, dude.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.860
Legitimately watching your reactions

08:37.860 --> 08:39.640
to things that happen

08:39.640 --> 08:41.380
and how stoked you get

08:41.380 --> 08:43.860
and how into the story you are at all times

08:43.860 --> 08:44.860
makes me,

08:45.820 --> 08:47.380
oh, I was gonna say horny,

08:47.380 --> 08:48.900
but I'm being genuine.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.420
No, you can say it.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.340
That's so nice, dude.

08:51.340 --> 08:52.500
At first, I thought it was just

08:52.500 --> 08:53.960
a veiled jab at Luke and I.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.900
But no, it makes it more fun as a player at the table.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.180
Yeah, it totally does.

09:01.180 --> 09:03.500
So moving on from the compliments.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.360
End of praise.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.500
No, moving on to Luke.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.220
Luke, you are without a doubt

09:19.220 --> 09:22.680
the most fun and spontaneous person

09:22.680 --> 09:25.500
I've ever like hung out with even.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.380
You are extremely enjoyable to be around

09:29.380 --> 09:33.220
due to your ability to take any situation

09:33.220 --> 09:35.300
and find the levity in it.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.100
I appreciate that so much.

09:37.100 --> 09:41.420
And I specifically within the realm of role-playing,

09:41.420 --> 09:45.580
anytime that I feel you grab the reins out of my hands,

09:45.580 --> 09:48.260
I'm nothing but overjoyed.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.500
Hell yeah.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.320
Thank you.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.460
And back to the questions.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.620
I can't do the same joke again.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.140
And Tom.

09:57.140 --> 09:57.980
You could.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.160
I thought, I almost thought you were just gonna go

10:00.160 --> 10:03.580
into the question, so I was like, I was fine with it.

10:03.580 --> 10:04.820
Thank you.

10:04.820 --> 10:09.820
Thomas, you make jokes that are literally standing

10:11.500 --> 10:14.740
on the precipice of like in and out of game

10:14.740 --> 10:17.460
in a way that, in my opinion,

10:17.460 --> 10:21.180
speaks to the soul of like how we role-play.

10:21.180 --> 10:26.060
Your ability to constantly have one hand in hot water

10:26.060 --> 10:30.760
and one hand in cold water is like absolutely excellent.

10:30.760 --> 10:35.080
Also, I respect you and any opinion that you bring

10:35.080 --> 10:37.900
to the table, regardless of how opposite

10:37.900 --> 10:40.500
of what I've just said is.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.020
Basically, you.

10:42.020 --> 10:47.020
You are one of the only people whose opinion I trust.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.580
Thank you.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.580
Also, the earliest stuff about me being the voice

11:00.580 --> 11:03.900
of a role-playing generation, I wonder if you said yes.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.040
Agreed.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.540
Legitimately though, I have a hard time taking

11:07.540 --> 11:09.260
anyone else's opinion.

11:09.260 --> 11:10.540
I'm very controlling.

11:10.580 --> 11:15.540
I think we all know this and I respect that a lot of you

11:15.540 --> 11:17.740
and I think you're a great dude.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.580
Thanks, bro.

11:18.580 --> 11:19.460
Same, please.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.820
I love you guys so much

11:21.820 --> 11:25.340
and you have changed my life for the better.

11:25.340 --> 11:26.180
Same.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.420
Back at you, man.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.620
I like you so much.

11:29.620 --> 11:34.300
I like barely, I barely remember a time with you.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.940
I love so much about you.

11:37.940 --> 11:41.300
I like don't remember a time in my life

11:41.300 --> 11:43.980
not playing this, even though it's only been.

11:43.980 --> 11:46.060
Yeah, I've blacked out all memories of life.

11:46.060 --> 11:47.900
Even though it's been more.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.980
Yeah, we've been doing it for like 10 years.

11:51.340 --> 11:52.700
No, I love you too.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.540
We love you too.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.360
Fuck all that.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.200
Shut up.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.040
All right, we've got a question from.

11:56.040 --> 11:56.860
Oh, wait, no, no.

11:56.860 --> 11:57.700
You said you had a question for us.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.620
We have to jerk each other off real quick.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.460
To finish.

12:03.100 --> 12:06.900
All right, so the question that I have is actually

12:06.900 --> 12:11.620
a question that I will ask at the top of the next episode,

12:11.620 --> 12:12.800
the next Q&A episode.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.060
I have a personal question for you guys.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.540
It's a teaser for next week.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.080
We could say you can expect to hear Justin

12:21.080 --> 12:22.260
on that next episode.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.900
That's right, that's right.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.180
Justin will be here for next week's Q&A.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.780
Check back in at 8.30.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.260
Justin's busy right now.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.540
All right, let's dive in here.

12:33.540 --> 12:35.860
We've got a question from.

12:35.860 --> 12:38.180
It was all a snow globe.

12:38.180 --> 12:41.100
They say, I hope it's okay to ask a few.

12:41.100 --> 12:41.940
It is.

12:41.940 --> 12:44.580
That was a classic reference to that one show.

12:44.580 --> 12:48.420
I was gonna say, do you millennials get that reference?

12:48.420 --> 12:52.220
Yeah, it's the thing where Chris O'Dowd

12:52.220 --> 12:55.220
dropped the snow globe in Travel Man.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.180
Okay.

12:56.180 --> 12:57.620
It's Saint something, right?

12:57.620 --> 12:58.520
Oh, okay.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.420
Saint Elmo.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.660
It's a spoiler no matter what.

13:01.660 --> 13:03.340
Once I'm a very drunk mom.

13:03.340 --> 13:04.540
Be careful.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.220
Oh yeah, just in case anybody's trying to watch

13:07.220 --> 13:08.060
Men in Black.

13:08.060 --> 13:09.620
That hospital show or whatever.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.700
They were in a marble and the marble had fake snow in it.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.100
Was it Saint Elsewhere?

13:14.100 --> 13:15.100
Saint Elsewhere, yeah.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.260
Okay, so real quick.

13:16.260 --> 13:19.780
Once I'm a very drunk mom in a bar in Colorado.

13:21.180 --> 13:22.580
It could be so much quicker.

13:23.700 --> 13:27.300
Once I'm a very drunk mom in a bar in Colorado

13:27.300 --> 13:29.940
asked me how old I was and I was like 29 at the time

13:29.940 --> 13:32.620
and I said 29 and she goes,

13:32.620 --> 13:34.220
oh, you're just like my son.

13:34.220 --> 13:35.700
You're a millennium.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.380
You're a millennium.

13:39.380 --> 13:40.860
I am.

13:40.860 --> 13:41.700
I'm a millennium.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.540
That's really good.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.380
Yeah.

13:43.380 --> 13:44.220
Okay, that's perfect.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.540
They asked, it was all snow globe, asks,

13:46.540 --> 13:50.500
who was the person in the woods in episode six?

13:50.500 --> 13:51.940
Charles Donovan.

13:51.940 --> 13:52.780
Okay.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.420
I should have asked who you thought it was

13:54.420 --> 13:56.740
but that would just belabor the whole part.

13:56.740 --> 13:57.580
Moving on.

13:57.580 --> 13:58.400
I would say, oh.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.240
Next question.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.040
Who is the ambiguously British man

14:02.040 --> 14:04.120
in the circle of white powder?

14:04.120 --> 14:06.360
I believe they are talking about the person

14:06.360 --> 14:08.480
that Lindsay's character talks to

14:08.480 --> 14:11.000
in the contention woods arc.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.200
That was an agent of Pisces.

14:15.200 --> 14:20.200
Delta Green has a British wing of its existence

14:21.040 --> 14:22.920
and they are called Pisces.

14:22.920 --> 14:27.460
And I believe that man had a tattoo somewhere

14:27.460 --> 14:30.220
and I believe, I did not look this up,

14:30.220 --> 14:34.460
but I think that I made that tattoo a reference

14:34.460 --> 14:37.800
to the fact that he was in Pisces.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.400
It might've even been a fish.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.220
Like it straight up might've been a fish tattoo.

14:42.220 --> 14:43.060
So, okay.

14:43.060 --> 14:44.880
So if any of us had run into him,

14:44.880 --> 14:46.340
we would have known right away.

14:46.340 --> 14:48.780
Yes.

14:48.780 --> 14:49.700
Next question.

14:49.700 --> 14:50.540
Fish, Pisces.

14:50.540 --> 14:53.220
So that's deep lore for somebody

14:53.220 --> 14:54.460
who knows Delta Green lore.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.700
Oh, that's some real deep lore.

14:56.780 --> 14:57.600
That wasn't for us.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.820
No.

14:58.820 --> 14:59.660
Zach, yeah.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.860
Speaking of like your own deep lore,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.260
I totally thought you were like,

15:03.260 --> 15:04.580
oh yeah, that was Pisces.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.660
They were competing against Myriad.

15:06.660 --> 15:08.140
You never really ran into them,

15:08.140 --> 15:09.420
but they were there the whole time.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.860
You guys literally never ran into anyone from Pisces.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.300
My cool fish men brigade.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.540
Actual company behind, was it Bar Corp?

15:18.540 --> 15:21.220
Bar Corp owned by Pisces.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.040
No.

15:22.040 --> 15:22.880
So next question.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.320
What does Joe smell like?

15:25.080 --> 15:27.480
What flavor vape do you have?

15:27.480 --> 15:28.320
Yeah.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.520
I got some strawberry milk tonight.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.660
Oh, that is an answer.

15:31.660 --> 15:32.500
All right.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.640
That's pretty much what he smells like just in general.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.240
I've known him since middle school.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.360
Joe, middle school.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.280
You've got the option.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.640
Chocolate, vanilla.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.960
Is it called vanilla milk?

15:42.960 --> 15:44.160
Regular.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.040
2%.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.400
Chocolate, milk, or strawberry?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.240
Strawberry.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.060
Oh, all right.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.160
And moving on, what was the asylum all about?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.240
Specifically the Satan plot line

15:54.240 --> 15:56.200
that apparently got dropped.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.800
Yeah, because I did mention at one point

15:58.800 --> 16:02.080
that the Satan, somebody asked about it mid-game.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.680
And I was like, yeah, like as an NPC,

16:04.680 --> 16:08.600
I think I said, you guys didn't look into that very much,

16:08.600 --> 16:09.800
so we didn't worry about it.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.000
I thought that you guys were gonna try to follow

16:12.000 --> 16:15.320
the agents, the dead president's cell,

16:15.320 --> 16:17.640
Kennedy, McKinley, and Harrison

16:17.640 --> 16:19.440
back to wherever they came from,

16:19.440 --> 16:23.120
or at least try to hitch more of a ride on what they had.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.440
But as we were role-playing,

16:24.440 --> 16:27.460
it just felt right to kind of leave you out in the cold.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.260
I could use that sentence for all role-playing.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.200
Yeah, that's your go-to instinct as a GM.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.680
And I'm trying to get better at it, all right?

16:40.840 --> 16:42.200
We're all growing.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.280
That's one thing that I'm gonna work on.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.280
No, it's fun and it leads to, I don't know.

16:47.280 --> 16:51.000
But if we do wanna not go 113 episodes again.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.320
Yeah, exactly.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
We go to the mill.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.020
So what was the asylum all about?

16:58.020 --> 17:01.100
So basically there's a woman there named,

17:01.100 --> 17:05.060
code name Satan, not actually birth name Satan.

17:05.060 --> 17:09.280
And she was in charge of running these different teams

17:09.280 --> 17:12.920
of essentially what Delta Green Lore would call cowboys.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.440
So your A through Z cells.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.000
But I decided instead of the modern day

17:18.000 --> 17:19.320
using A through Z cells,

17:19.320 --> 17:21.520
they would have gotten rid of it by then

17:21.520 --> 17:24.440
and come up with some fun alternatives.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.840
So I thought dead presidents was a fun combo of things.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.720
So I went with that.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.500
But that is also where K cell was run out of,

17:32.500 --> 17:35.880
because they originally started with the alphabet cells

17:35.880 --> 17:38.740
as cowboys, essentially fighting against

17:38.740 --> 17:41.400
the unnatural threat to the world,

17:41.400 --> 17:44.580
not with government oversight.

17:44.580 --> 17:49.020
And so that is what the asylum is specifically all about.

17:49.020 --> 17:52.620
The woman who runs it, she's a black and white character.

17:52.620 --> 17:53.900
She's got a lot going on.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.520
She lives in the middle.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.620
Yeah, I don't know.

17:57.980 --> 18:01.060
Everyone's got like a middling agenda.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.940
In Delta Green, from what I can tell,

18:02.940 --> 18:05.160
there aren't a lot of like specifically good

18:05.160 --> 18:07.820
or specifically bad people.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.940
Some people get turned bad by circumstance,

18:10.940 --> 18:15.500
but everyone's kind of like trying to do their best

18:15.500 --> 18:17.300
with the hand they've been dealt.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.180
I don't know.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.760
So that's what was happening at the asylum.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.540
If somebody else asks a question about it later,

18:22.540 --> 18:25.620
which I bet they do, I might add to that.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.320
And that part of Delta Green,

18:27.320 --> 18:29.400
it just really stresses me out when we're playing it,

18:29.400 --> 18:32.160
because it's not like real life where you know right away,

18:32.160 --> 18:34.460
like, oh, do they believe in Jesus?

18:34.460 --> 18:35.300
They're good or bad.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.420
You can just know, and all the uncertainty

18:38.420 --> 18:40.820
and like the grayness, it gives me a headache.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.660
Yeah.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.900
No, thank you.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.740
Yeah.

18:43.740 --> 18:48.740
Hey, why don't you just ask the NPCs if they believe in Jesus?

18:48.740 --> 18:51.900
Are you a good person or a bad person?

18:51.900 --> 18:53.380
So they finish it out.

18:53.380 --> 18:55.140
Snow Globe finishes it out by saying,

18:55.140 --> 18:56.860
thank you all for everything.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.300
This is by far my favorite podcast,

18:59.300 --> 19:00.620
which is just a very nice thing.

19:00.620 --> 19:01.860
Thanks, us too.

19:01.860 --> 19:02.820
It's a nice thing to say.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.560
It is ours as well.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.580
Ain't on a no, no, no.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.420
Is that how you say it?

19:07.420 --> 19:08.260
Ain't on a no, no, no.

19:09.100 --> 19:11.060
Ain't on a no, no, no.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.420
Which is No Way Hang On.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.500
That's one of our beautiful mods

19:15.500 --> 19:17.580
over on the subreddit and the discord.

19:17.580 --> 19:18.620
We've got a question.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.900
What's y'all's favorite karaoke jam?

19:21.900 --> 19:24.340
Soak Up The Sun by Shirl Crow.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.300
That's good.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.780
Soak Up The Sun is real good.

19:27.780 --> 19:28.860
I just do Beatles songs,

19:28.860 --> 19:30.140
cause I know the words already.

19:30.140 --> 19:30.980
Yep.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.460
And what are Beatles songs?

19:34.460 --> 19:36.500
It's this band that I've been into lately.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.460
They're kind of coming up.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.840
And Thomas, do you do karaoke?

19:39.840 --> 19:41.040
I actually never have.

19:41.040 --> 19:41.880
Really?

19:41.880 --> 19:42.700
Really.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.100
Wait, when we did karaoke at my house, did you not sing?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.060
Oh, I probably did.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.700
But like drunk, living room karaoke.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.220
I've never been in a bar full of people,

19:51.220 --> 19:54.780
like strangers, selected a song and sang that song.

19:54.780 --> 19:55.700
Yeah.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.940
Thomas, you were actually there though

19:57.940 --> 20:00.780
for my birthday a couple of years ago.

20:00.780 --> 20:01.820
After the ball game.

20:01.820 --> 20:05.180
Yeah, you got me tickets to a Cardinals game

20:05.220 --> 20:07.020
for my birthday.

20:07.020 --> 20:09.980
That was a surprise, which was fucking rad.

20:09.980 --> 20:13.320
We went and hung out and watched a day game in St. Louis

20:13.320 --> 20:14.380
that I didn't know was happening.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.320
Yeah, I got you those tickets,

20:16.320 --> 20:19.220
not your wife and my partner.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.060
You know what?

20:20.060 --> 20:21.060
It actually makes more sense

20:21.060 --> 20:23.660
that it was my wife who got me those tickets.

20:23.660 --> 20:26.020
And then after the ball game, we like-

20:26.020 --> 20:27.560
There's a chance I totally pitched in.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.400
I don't know.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.220
Yeah, I don't know, man.

20:29.220 --> 20:30.060
Who knows?

20:30.060 --> 20:30.900
But I would bet.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.440
I was just willing to give you full credit here

20:33.440 --> 20:34.460
on the recording.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.820
Oh yeah, just like if either of the other people

20:36.820 --> 20:39.260
involved heard that, they would probably be like, what?

20:39.260 --> 20:40.860
Oh, they're not listening.

20:40.860 --> 20:42.060
They're not listening to this?

20:42.060 --> 20:42.900
That's fair.

20:42.900 --> 20:47.000
And so I sing my go-to karaoke jam,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.500
which we have posted a video of me singing

20:50.500 --> 20:52.180
on Instagram and Twitter.

20:52.180 --> 20:53.020
You can find it there.

20:53.020 --> 20:53.860
And that is me singing-

20:53.860 --> 20:55.180
Oh baby, baby.

20:56.540 --> 21:00.380
How was I supposed to know?

21:00.380 --> 21:02.700
My go-to is Hit Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears,

21:02.700 --> 21:06.220
specifically because it is just out of my range.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.780
Zach, I was actually going through my Instagram

21:08.780 --> 21:12.220
story archives the other day and came across those videos.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.700
And do you remember the guy who sung After You?

21:14.700 --> 21:17.060
No, I was on a high.

21:19.540 --> 21:23.780
He was very red and drunk.

21:23.780 --> 21:24.740
Oh yeah, classic.

21:24.740 --> 21:25.580
Like karaoke.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.020
The Cardinals colors.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.060
Well, that's Neil.

21:29.060 --> 21:32.060
Looked like yellow teeth, red face.

21:32.260 --> 21:35.180
It looked like most of the guys at a Cardinals game,

21:35.180 --> 21:38.820
like meaning like late forties, a polo.

21:38.820 --> 21:40.980
And they love the polos.

21:40.980 --> 21:44.140
He was shit-faced, but passionate.

21:44.140 --> 21:49.140
And he was singing Closing Time at like 3 p.m. I bet.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.680
I love that song.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.940
Compliment from ainonanonono.

21:53.940 --> 21:54.900
Nice cock, bro.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.740
Thank you.

21:55.740 --> 21:56.560
Thanks.

21:56.560 --> 21:57.400
Wouldn't you like to know?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.840
All right, and a question from ainonanonono.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.760
I remember Zach delivering some well-deserved praise

22:02.760 --> 22:05.640
to Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,

22:05.640 --> 22:09.420
which shares some fun elements with season one of PTBP.

22:09.420 --> 22:12.000
What other foundational media or artists

22:12.000 --> 22:14.420
have influenced y'all in this season

22:14.420 --> 22:17.620
as handler and players?

22:17.620 --> 22:22.080
Anyone have an inspiration to you as a player

22:22.080 --> 22:24.200
or just to give you like a head space

22:24.200 --> 22:26.040
of what this game we're playing was?

22:26.040 --> 22:26.920
I just do whatever I want.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.280
Yeah, there, yeah, yeah.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.840
The most truthful answer.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.320
Yeah, Wild West Arc was all Deadwood in my brain.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.160
Yeah.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.000
Deadwood was what I would reference in my brain.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.840
Mine was Red Dead Redemption.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.580
In general, just all police media.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.480
Yeah, like that pop culture is inundated with

22:44.480 --> 22:46.800
so just lots of cop stereotypes

22:46.800 --> 22:51.000
and then the actual place we live for.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.600
Yeah, for sure.

22:52.600 --> 22:56.000
The actual place we live and like going hiking

22:56.000 --> 22:58.880
or just visiting other small towns around

22:59.440 --> 23:03.360
and getting a feel for what life is like in a smaller town.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.480
I actually drove through Mountain Grove.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.600
I mean, literally just passed it.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.840
You literally drove through.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.680
I literally drove through.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.440
You're the one who drove through Mountain Grove.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.280
I drove through.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.920
You drove through the downtown just like

23:14.920 --> 23:15.760
Mountain Grove.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.240
Blues Brothers style like that mall.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.240
Hung out for a little bit, just drove around.

23:19.240 --> 23:22.180
That's the small town that I stole the map from

23:22.180 --> 23:23.760
for contention.

23:23.760 --> 23:24.580
Oh, nice.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.520
Oh, really?

23:25.520 --> 23:28.800
I stole the map from Mountain Grove, Missouri.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.600
The layout of the roads and things.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.640
Yeah, I did.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.360
I dated someone and grew up there

23:33.360 --> 23:37.360
and when I was like 19 and we drove out there a few times

23:37.360 --> 23:39.320
to hang out with her parents.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.240
And it was, it's very small.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.080
It's really small, yeah.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.400
You've been to contention then.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.720
Yeah, you've been to contention.

23:45.720 --> 23:49.920
All right, yeah, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency

23:49.920 --> 23:50.760
and like-

23:50.760 --> 23:54.120
Anything ever Delta Green or not Delta Green,

23:54.120 --> 23:57.240
but like Lovecraft.

23:57.260 --> 24:02.260
I've literally never like read Lovecraft.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.800
I've seen some movies.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.400
It's good.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.040
I don't read, but read Dirk Gently's

24:14.040 --> 24:15.260
Holistic Detective Agency.

24:15.260 --> 24:16.500
I took a lot from that.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.320
Compliment, thanks for making me laugh so hard.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.760
I cried a few times.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.600
Wow.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.440
I'm glad we did it to you

24:22.440 --> 24:23.920
because we did it to ourselves a lot.

24:23.920 --> 24:24.760
Oh yeah.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.800
We had more fun making it than you did listening to it.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.640
Oh, 100%.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.400
And I'm glad our podcast made you so hard, you cried.

24:33.920 --> 24:38.920
L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.960
L-Elephant, L-Elephant, L-Elephant.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.120
I think it's just L-Elephant.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.840
L-Elephant, L-Elephant.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.720
Like their name is probably L.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.320
Congrats on finishing the first season.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.160
Thanks.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.000
Thank you.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.240
There have been a lot of little Easter eggs

24:57.240 --> 24:59.480
for people paying a lot of attention.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.320
There was, quote, no backbone being,

25:02.320 --> 25:05.040
oh, by the way, we're doing spoilers.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.040
Yeah, big time.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.880
We might need Dog to say that.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.840
Yeah, well.

25:12.840 --> 25:13.680
Who's Dog?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.500
We'll have Dog.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.480
Joe's on a first, last name basis.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.320
Last name basis, yeah.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.160
We know each other pretty well.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.000
Joe's on a last name basis with Dog.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.160
No, he has to call him Mr. Dog.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.640
Over the years, we've gotten to know each other

25:22.680 --> 25:24.080
pretty well.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.480
I think I can call him Dog.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.080
No backbone being a more relevant song than first thought.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.360
Yes, classic.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.160
The Wizard of Oznod with what everyone lost

25:38.160 --> 25:40.160
slash was searching for in the raid

25:40.160 --> 25:42.000
on Marvin Glass's compound.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.160
I think at one point you named some corpses

25:45.160 --> 25:47.200
after the last podcast on the left crew.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.400
Actually, those were the costumes that Billy Harrison

25:51.440 --> 25:54.280
was tied up in the back of Charles Donovan's trunk

25:54.280 --> 25:56.360
and also in Charles Donovan's trunk

25:56.360 --> 25:59.320
was Charles Donovan's extra disguises

25:59.320 --> 26:02.400
in which he used the last podcast on the left crew

26:02.400 --> 26:03.600
as covers.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.120
Oh, what are some of your favorite Easter eggs

26:06.120 --> 26:08.640
no one has mentioned yet?

26:08.640 --> 26:09.880
What's an anagram?

26:11.500 --> 26:12.340
Am I thinking of the right?

26:12.340 --> 26:13.760
Whether it's all mixed up.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.680
It's all mixed up, yes.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.680
Okay, so Tildy B. Mitchell is an anagram.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.560
Oh, fuck, what's it for though?

26:21.560 --> 26:25.080
I refuse to look for anagrams in every name you give us.

26:25.080 --> 26:30.080
I'm looking up anagram solver.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.500
It's not gonna give it to you because it's like half baked.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.200
It's like lit B.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.040
It's lit.

26:38.040 --> 26:38.880
How do you spell Tildy?

26:38.880 --> 26:43.320
Oh, T-I-L-D-E B as B

26:43.320 --> 26:46.160
and then Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.000
But lit is part of it?

26:47.000 --> 26:47.840
It's lit.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.800
Fucking good, dude.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.140
Meet Bill Ted.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.520
Wait, are you for real?

26:54.520 --> 26:55.880
Good anagram, bro.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.160
What, Bill Ted?

26:57.160 --> 26:59.200
Yeah, like Bill and Ted because they time travel.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.840
So you had the time travel and the fact that she was

27:01.840 --> 27:05.280
zombie-ish or undead-ish from that early on

27:05.280 --> 27:06.100
that you just named her.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.760
Holy fuck, that's cool.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.000
I thought that came later.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.840
I thought those revelations came later.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.860
That is what Keith might name his meat monster.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.280
Lich meet Bill Ted.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.600
Nice, good one.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.680
But that was her name.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.320
Tildy B. Mitchell.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.240
Tildy B. Mitchell.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.320
Yeah, like exactly.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.680
Like from birth, right?

27:26.680 --> 27:27.520
Yeah.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.340
I guess that.

27:28.340 --> 27:29.180
She was destined.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.020
That was just fun for Zach.

27:30.020 --> 27:32.360
That's just a fun detail outside of the canon.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.200
Yeah, that doesn't mean anything.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.040
It's an Easter egg.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.480
That's just a Zach fun time.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.600
What's another Easter egg?

27:37.600 --> 27:41.620
There's one that a fan found that you definitely put in,

27:41.620 --> 27:44.960
none of us caught was the Mary Coles Institute

27:44.960 --> 27:45.800
or whatever it was.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.760
It was an acronym for consume, was it?

27:48.760 --> 27:50.000
Consume, yeah.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
The Coles Orphanage colon new school under modern etiquette.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.000
Somebody pointed that out on Twitter and it blew my mind.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.560
I thought that I made it so stilted

28:02.560 --> 28:04.920
that you guys would be like, why is it that?

28:04.920 --> 28:07.280
Every time you do that, I'm just like,

28:07.280 --> 28:11.120
I'm not gonna make Zach feel bad about his English.

28:11.120 --> 28:16.120
Well, now you know to make fun of me

28:16.560 --> 28:19.700
and reveal my hidden secrets,

28:19.700 --> 28:21.240
but also it might hurt my feelings.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.200
So, you know, it's a time when we're like,

28:25.200 --> 28:28.440
that must be one of your weird things, right?

28:28.440 --> 28:32.700
And you're just like, no, no, no, no, Thomas.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.480
Anyway, so that's one.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.660
Consume is definitely one that I really liked.

28:38.660 --> 28:42.060
Oh, this one's dumb.

28:42.060 --> 28:46.420
This one's so dumb, but Oz Mayhem Wolf,

28:46.420 --> 28:51.420
his brother was Elby, E-L-B-Y, which is not a name.

28:52.180 --> 28:53.180
But like pounds or?

28:53.180 --> 28:56.300
Yeah, L-B and ounces.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.340
That's good, that's a good one.

28:58.340 --> 28:59.180
I like that.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.900
That was real stupid.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.660
That's real good.

29:02.660 --> 29:03.900
Did we ever meet Elby?

29:03.900 --> 29:05.460
No, he just talked about him.

29:05.460 --> 29:06.300
He mentioned him, yeah.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.300
Oh, okay.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.900
He mentioned him once.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.540
Keith Vigna, Vigna is a type of bean or something.

29:12.540 --> 29:16.780
Yeah, Vigna is a genus, I think, of bean.

29:16.780 --> 29:18.680
It's a science version of a bean.

29:20.180 --> 29:21.260
It's a sciency bean.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.460
It's a science bean.

29:22.460 --> 29:27.140
John Lee Pettymore is named from the song,

29:27.140 --> 29:30.140
Copperhead Road by Steve Earle.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.860
We kind of made his dad something else,

29:31.860 --> 29:35.400
but I guess Kevin is literally the character

29:35.400 --> 29:36.240
in Copperhead Road.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.040
Exactly.

29:38.040 --> 29:38.880
Clark was born with a tail.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.960
Just a little Easter egg for you.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.400
And never got it removed.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.240
He had it the whole campaign.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.080
The whole time.

29:44.080 --> 29:44.920
The whole time.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.680
If you just looked at his back,

29:46.680 --> 29:48.080
you would have seen it wagging every now and then.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.920
If you'd done an alertness check,

29:49.920 --> 29:53.780
you actually had detailed emotional responses for the tail.

29:53.780 --> 29:54.960
I had rolls I could have made.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.320
For those of you who are gonna go back

29:56.320 --> 29:58.100
and listen through the campaign,

29:58.100 --> 30:00.400
you'll find a slight whooshing sound.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.000
I do remember one last Easter egg.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.280
Right before we started this whole thing,

30:08.280 --> 30:10.560
Zach was like, okay, your character is God.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.480
This is all a dream that he's created

30:12.480 --> 30:13.560
for the other characters.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.360
So just remember that at the end.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.100
I was like, okay, yeah, for sure.

30:18.100 --> 30:18.940
I wrote it down.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.200
The only thing in my notes.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.440
You're God.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.520
What are you looking at?

30:25.520 --> 30:27.760
Trying to find my cheat sheet.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.560
Just show you guys my cheat sheet

30:29.560 --> 30:31.040
where I had listed like.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.920
There was, I was frantically reading as fast as I could.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.880
Was trying to consume all the little nuggets

30:38.880 --> 30:40.520
as it went by.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.800
There was a bunch of stuff in there, man.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.040
I was on top of a lot of stuff that was happening

30:45.040 --> 30:47.000
on certain time restraints for a while.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.160
Yeah, that was a weird time when you guys were like

30:51.160 --> 30:53.160
at the end of your time in contention

30:53.160 --> 30:56.480
when all the moving parts were happening.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.680
And I was trying to keep track of it.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.400
All right, let's move on.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.140
Hope it's okay to do two questions.

31:01.140 --> 31:02.360
It is, we'll keep going.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.640
A little while ago,

31:03.640 --> 31:06.400
I had an idea about a connection to Martin Cupertino

31:06.400 --> 31:09.920
being an influential person wanting to create cube

31:09.920 --> 31:12.000
during the calm comfy campground arc

31:12.000 --> 31:15.280
and the contention boys chasing down the origins

31:15.280 --> 31:17.520
of what they called ball.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.680
I get that Martin was a Steve Jobs stand in,

31:20.680 --> 31:25.680
but was the cube versus ball connection intentional

31:25.920 --> 31:29.120
or am I grasping at straws?

31:29.120 --> 31:33.020
I'm gonna turn this one over to Thomas for the answer.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.780
Unfortunately, grasping at straws cube

31:35.780 --> 31:39.580
was just a parody of the original iMac.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.860
And then like the crazy promises about cube

31:41.860 --> 31:45.780
were just like Zombocom style like nonsense

31:45.780 --> 31:48.180
and over promising like tech world.

31:48.180 --> 31:51.300
Like this will solve every problem anybody's ever had.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.140
It's the normal stuff.

31:52.140 --> 31:56.980
It's a very, very, very simple broad parody of Steve Jobs.

32:03.460 --> 32:04.820
We got to think about our pace.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.140
Cause I think we have 50 total in three.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.060
Yeah, we're on page one of nine.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.140
The reason it was called, we are 30 minutes in.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.140
The reason it was called cube

32:14.140 --> 32:16.900
is cause the iMac is like a cube shape kind of.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.740
Nice.

32:17.740 --> 32:20.380
Soren Ash asks.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.740
Oh yeah, you guys keep going, I'm gonna go pee.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.580
Oh, I didn't know you were peeing right now.

32:24.580 --> 32:25.980
This isn't one we can answer.

32:27.340 --> 32:28.180
We could try.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.340
I'll read it and we'll try.

32:29.340 --> 32:32.180
Okay, so the things I've racked up over time.

32:32.220 --> 32:35.500
How did Marvin get removed from the myriad hive mind?

32:35.500 --> 32:37.100
That's a question I've had myself.

32:37.100 --> 32:41.620
Yeah, so here's my best guess.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.220
Marvin, he just didn't want to be in it anymore.

32:44.220 --> 32:46.260
That was my, exactly what I was gonna say.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.660
He just wanted it more.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.740
Like kind of the odd, but he like he wanted out and he did.

32:50.740 --> 32:52.940
I can't remember if I said this on the podcast

32:52.940 --> 32:54.460
or if it was after a session one time,

32:54.460 --> 32:58.220
but I wondered if he was some link in an evolution

32:58.220 --> 33:00.740
between Tildy and what we know as myriad,

33:00.740 --> 33:01.900
whether he was in the middle

33:01.900 --> 33:04.260
or he was an evolved beyond myriad.

33:04.260 --> 33:06.780
I think he was just like a funny guy.

33:06.780 --> 33:08.340
He's just a wild and crazy dude.

33:08.340 --> 33:09.180
Next question.

33:09.180 --> 33:11.740
Yeah, were Marvin's sons his biological sons?

33:11.740 --> 33:12.580
Yes.

33:12.580 --> 33:13.420
Was the glass syndicate just a puppet

33:13.420 --> 33:14.820
for some greater organization?

33:14.820 --> 33:15.660
Yes, next question.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.100
Yeah, yes and yes.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.940
What was Stan and Nancy's agenda

33:18.940 --> 33:21.940
and by extension that of the city asylum?

33:21.940 --> 33:22.780
Zach never knew.

33:22.780 --> 33:23.940
He didn't actually have.

33:24.820 --> 33:27.940
And yes, he did just keep forgetting her name.

33:27.940 --> 33:29.820
He wanted, they were actually,

33:29.820 --> 33:32.660
the city asylum was trying to research the brown note.

33:32.660 --> 33:33.900
Right, yeah.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.420
Okay, we've covered the first few.

33:35.420 --> 33:37.700
Yeah, we got it all Zach, pretty thoroughly.

33:37.700 --> 33:38.900
Do you guys have any questions?

33:38.900 --> 33:40.020
Should I add in anything?

33:40.020 --> 33:41.980
I was wondering how did Marvin get removed

33:41.980 --> 33:44.260
from myriad hive mind?

33:44.260 --> 33:45.700
How did Marvin remove himself?

33:45.700 --> 33:46.780
Smart question, Joe.

33:46.780 --> 33:48.300
Yeah, good question.

33:48.300 --> 33:51.380
Okay, so Marvin was like the fallen angel essentially

33:51.380 --> 33:53.620
of these creatures

33:53.620 --> 33:55.980
and that's all I ever really thought about it.

33:55.980 --> 33:57.260
I like it though, that's also cool.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.820
Well, that would also be a great campaign,

33:59.820 --> 34:00.660
a mini campaign.

34:00.660 --> 34:04.140
Yeah, it really, I honestly had a certain thought

34:04.140 --> 34:06.820
as we were recording from 100 on.

34:06.820 --> 34:11.020
I was like, I could do at least three or four more spin-offs.

34:11.020 --> 34:13.300
Like we could do this theoretically forever.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.900
Yeah, oh yeah, Jesus Christ Ministries

34:15.900 --> 34:19.340
could have easily had its own one shot,

34:19.340 --> 34:20.900
which I was planning for a while

34:20.900 --> 34:22.460
and then abandoned at a certain point.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.060
Well, that was Fergie's thing, right?

34:24.060 --> 34:24.900
Yeah.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.860
Fergie's whole crime organization.

34:26.860 --> 34:30.220
With all those little kids that were all like androids.

34:30.220 --> 34:33.940
Yeah, oh, we could play Android orphans.

34:33.940 --> 34:37.040
Yeah, like that would be very fun.

34:37.040 --> 34:40.500
So that's all I really ever had for Marvin.

34:40.500 --> 34:41.940
Oh, were his sons biological?

34:41.940 --> 34:42.980
No, they were not.

34:42.980 --> 34:43.820
What was their deal?

34:43.820 --> 34:44.660
Were they created?

34:44.660 --> 34:48.140
No, he was dealing in trafficking

34:48.140 --> 34:51.980
and so he took two of the strongest ones

34:51.980 --> 34:56.180
from the Den of Sin and made them his sons.

34:56.180 --> 34:58.580
Gotcha, so they know they're not his sons.

34:58.580 --> 35:02.260
They have been, they had been like brainwashed

35:02.260 --> 35:07.060
to basically just like the Glass family was their family.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.860
They were Glass boys like through and through,

35:09.860 --> 35:11.680
but one of them had their mind melted

35:11.680 --> 35:13.480
before the season started

35:13.480 --> 35:18.480
and the other one got sent to the dark place.

35:18.560 --> 35:23.000
So they were not role played through very thoroughly

35:23.000 --> 35:25.780
just because of their circumstances.

35:25.780 --> 35:29.880
Another question here, biological sons.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.400
Was the Glass syndicate just a puppet

35:31.400 --> 35:32.640
for some greater organization?

35:32.640 --> 35:34.160
The Glass syndicate was not a puppet.

35:34.160 --> 35:37.760
The Glass syndicate was held strong by Marvin Glass

35:37.760 --> 35:40.400
who definitely held his own against Myriad.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
That's interesting, so that's, we disagree on that.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.600
Okay, that's fair.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.640
What was your guys' answer?

35:44.640 --> 35:45.480
We said yes.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.320
And who was the hand?

35:49.320 --> 35:51.160
We said yes, next question.

35:51.160 --> 35:55.400
Next question, what was Man Stan Steen's agenda

35:55.400 --> 35:58.760
and by extension that of the city asylum?

35:58.760 --> 36:01.040
Okay, so these are two very different questions

36:01.040 --> 36:03.120
specifically because the city asylum

36:03.120 --> 36:08.080
was holding Stan Man Steen as a prisoner at the time.

36:08.080 --> 36:11.400
He was let out only to go to his daughter's funeral

36:11.400 --> 36:15.240
as a courtesy and he used that time

36:15.240 --> 36:18.240
to get the fuck out of existence

36:18.240 --> 36:22.560
which was his goal due to his ability to see.

36:23.800 --> 36:26.720
He was living the same kind of life where you guys were

36:26.720 --> 36:30.960
where his idea of the world kept changing.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.360
Every single time something unnatural happened,

36:33.360 --> 36:36.440
I changed the town of contention slightly

36:36.440 --> 36:38.720
and the main clue of that change

36:38.720 --> 36:43.720
was the name of your fourth police officer in contention

36:43.720 --> 36:46.120
and small other changes happened

36:46.120 --> 36:49.200
but the only one that we really stumbled across in game

36:49.200 --> 36:51.240
was Randy Angst.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.720
Those were like set about as little things

36:53.720 --> 36:57.800
that could pop up if the right questions were asked

36:57.800 --> 37:00.400
which I should have, again,

37:00.400 --> 37:02.120
just learning how to be a better GM

37:02.120 --> 37:04.400
pushed that theme forward.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.040
But Stan was always aware of these changes like we were.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.320
He very much was.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.600
I thought they felt weird.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.640
Yep, and so he fucked off and when he fucked off,

37:13.640 --> 37:16.320
he landed himself in a heap of trouble

37:16.320 --> 37:18.880
and then eventually got a hold of a phone

37:18.880 --> 37:23.880
and needed some help from the future pulp hero overseer.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.200
Yeah, at the end there.

37:26.200 --> 37:30.080
So that would be a fun thing to look into.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.920
I would love that story.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.640
Okay, so yeah, he only showed up twice

37:34.640 --> 37:38.680
but I thought of him as just another person

37:38.680 --> 37:40.520
who is dealing with the same thing

37:40.520 --> 37:43.040
where he saw what was happening in the world.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.560
There were some other people like that as well.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.560
Mildred Mitchell being one of them.

37:47.560 --> 37:51.280
If you guys had talked about your fourth officer around her,

37:51.280 --> 37:55.520
she would have gotten the name wrong like you guys had.

37:55.520 --> 37:59.280
Were K cell and the FBI agents working for the same group?

37:59.280 --> 38:01.080
Yes, but in different time periods.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.200
Given that in the ending,

38:02.200 --> 38:04.280
the FBI agents were answering to the lady

38:04.760 --> 38:05.960
that got dubbed Satan,

38:05.960 --> 38:10.120
it seems as though there was another pernicious element

38:10.120 --> 38:14.320
at play and that K cell was likely opposed to them.

38:14.320 --> 38:17.160
To clarify, my working theory is that the FBI agents

38:17.160 --> 38:20.760
working for Satan are an M-A-R-Y-esque threat

38:20.760 --> 38:22.560
with some evil agenda in mind.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.600
Yes, I mean, they are as much a threat

38:24.600 --> 38:27.160
as the group of cowboys are a threat

38:27.160 --> 38:29.120
in traditional Delta Green lore,

38:29.120 --> 38:32.200
which, you know, Delta Green agents are a threat, man.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.200
That's just kind of how it happens.

38:34.960 --> 38:35.800
Their goal is to-

38:35.800 --> 38:36.880
Mr. Steal Your Girl.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.600
Yeah, exactly.

38:38.600 --> 38:43.600
And so that is the reason why the father of Maggie Cook,

38:45.080 --> 38:46.940
I almost said Tim Cook,

38:46.940 --> 38:51.080
well, it was Jim Cook, which is why I called him that,

38:51.080 --> 38:54.600
is Jim Cook, he worked for Satan

38:54.600 --> 38:58.620
and that's why he had a reference to Satan in his house.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.920
But by the end of his time,

39:00.960 --> 39:04.920
he was working against her machinations.

39:04.920 --> 39:09.520
So moving on, what was up with all the numbers plague deal?

39:09.520 --> 39:11.480
What was up with the numbers plague deal?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.720
What was the overseer's original motivation

39:13.720 --> 39:15.060
for setting it off?

39:15.060 --> 39:18.440
Also, it seemed like the overseer considered that run

39:18.440 --> 39:23.340
a quote, success, despite everyone dying on that go round.

39:23.340 --> 39:24.180
Why?

39:24.180 --> 39:26.740
Did we know that Joe set that off, Luke?

39:26.740 --> 39:29.000
I have, I don't think so.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.640
It seemed like it'd be fun.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.360
Get the fuck out of our house.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.460
They got into you.

39:34.460 --> 39:35.300
That was cool.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.560
Answer the question, Joe.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.400
I don't have an answer.

39:39.400 --> 39:42.220
You set off that, you were the overseer at that point.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.880
I had not become the overseer yet.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.160
So basically the overseer got a hold of someone

39:47.160 --> 39:49.680
with good intentions from the other side.

39:49.680 --> 39:53.360
I had it so that the overseer would make lots of mistakes

39:53.360 --> 39:56.640
throughout his time because in Delta Green,

39:56.640 --> 40:00.740
the characters traditionally 60% of the time

40:00.740 --> 40:01.960
succeed on stuff.

40:01.960 --> 40:05.080
And so I kept that in mind as I worked

40:05.080 --> 40:07.020
through the overseer's plan.

40:07.020 --> 40:12.020
And his plan for CSU and for Bar Corp was,

40:12.840 --> 40:17.840
he did not plan for CSU to become a crazy suicide haven.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.200
That was not his plan at all.

40:21.200 --> 40:26.200
His plan was to give this woman, this activist,

40:27.240 --> 40:31.740
on CSU's campus, the ability to change the mind

40:31.740 --> 40:34.300
of Bruce Robin, the leader of Bar Corp,

40:34.300 --> 40:38.520
and make him a better leader as the head

40:38.520 --> 40:43.360
of the biggest corporation in the city.

40:43.360 --> 40:47.160
And so he failed in that.

40:47.160 --> 40:51.280
And accidentally set off a whole thing

40:51.280 --> 40:54.120
where basically the spell went cattywampus

40:54.120 --> 40:56.160
and the cleanup needed to happen.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.400
It was almost working though

40:57.400 --> 40:58.680
because didn't we run into people saying

40:58.680 --> 41:00.240
that he's had a change of heart

41:00.240 --> 41:01.480
and has been doing things better lately?

41:01.480 --> 41:02.320
Exactly. That's cool.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.600
It was so close to working, but something was off,

41:05.600 --> 41:09.280
which is just kind of a constant in Delta Green

41:09.280 --> 41:11.220
is that, yeah, you can use the unnatural

41:11.220 --> 41:13.520
and sometimes the unnatural can do good things,

41:13.520 --> 41:17.360
but overwhelmingly, if you try to use the unnatural

41:17.360 --> 41:19.160
for good, it's not gonna work out.

41:19.160 --> 41:23.040
And so that was my thought for that whole arc.

41:23.040 --> 41:23.880
Dope.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.680
I can tell you why the overseer considered it

41:26.120 --> 41:26.960
a success.

41:26.960 --> 41:30.000
That giant is for sure the thing

41:30.000 --> 41:32.400
that was on his mind the whole time.

41:32.400 --> 41:36.080
Defeating that was his most solid of a goal,

41:36.080 --> 41:38.360
at least when I got ahold of him.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.040
So anything that doesn't hurt that effort is a success.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.080
Yeah.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.520
Exactly.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.920
A wild gazebo asks, I think that story arc,

41:47.920 --> 41:52.920
oh, they were adding on to what was said by Soren Ash.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.520
They said, I think that story arc needs

41:56.240 --> 41:57.080
the most explaining.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.120
I love how just wild everything got,

42:00.120 --> 42:01.680
but they didn't really investigate

42:01.680 --> 42:03.640
and find out any of the plot points there.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.080
Yeah, they were a little preoccupied

42:05.080 --> 42:08.140
with all the shit that I was throwing at them constantly.

42:08.140 --> 42:11.220
Wouldn't change that because it's a great in a way

42:11.220 --> 42:12.800
to see it all go missed.

42:12.800 --> 42:16.160
I just wanna know what any of that is about

42:16.160 --> 42:20.100
and exactly how high did that girl end up going.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.720
And ShamWow Chameleon, I can tell you,

42:22.720 --> 42:25.040
got real, real high.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.880
Did she grab a passing helicopter at some point?

42:27.880 --> 42:30.560
She did, she got ahold of a passing helicopter,

42:30.560 --> 42:34.200
got even higher and then in my mind,

42:34.200 --> 42:35.240
into the rotors.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.560
I think she probably just convinced

42:37.560 --> 42:42.560
the helicopter pilot to keep going up and up and up.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.800
That's what I like to think.

42:47.800 --> 42:52.440
Got a thing from Jake Medrano, 911 says,

42:52.440 --> 42:54.120
always love your stuff.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.600
Hey, that's a big always.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.000
Thanks.

42:58.000 --> 42:58.840
What about this?

42:58.840 --> 43:01.340
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

43:01.340 --> 43:03.680
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

43:03.680 --> 43:04.520
You love that?

43:06.400 --> 43:08.120
Testing your boundaries.

43:08.120 --> 43:12.120
He did say always and boy, we're still living in it.

43:16.780 --> 43:18.060
My God.

43:18.060 --> 43:18.900
Anyway.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.040
Yeah, they say Sean McCoy,

43:21.040 --> 43:23.840
who is the creator of Mothership,

43:24.440 --> 43:26.400
which is a RPG game,

43:26.400 --> 43:28.820
recently did an AMA where he mentioned

43:28.820 --> 43:31.520
he loved your podcast and hope you eventually

43:31.520 --> 43:34.600
did a adventure campaign of Mothership.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.280
I've been looking for a good actual play

43:36.280 --> 43:37.960
and would love to see you guys cover that.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.960
Hope this finds you well.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.220
I'm found well.

43:41.220 --> 43:42.080
I'm found well.

43:42.080 --> 43:42.920
Same.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.480
Yeah, Thomas, you found well?

43:45.880 --> 43:46.700
Yeah.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.880
This is the question that Thomas was gonna lead us

43:51.880 --> 43:53.560
through the answer of.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.520
Because it is asking about Mothership and Sean McCoy.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.840
And we are-

43:58.840 --> 43:59.880
I don't know fucking shit about it.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.040
He just asked me to look him up

44:01.040 --> 44:02.540
and see if it was problematic.

44:04.280 --> 44:05.520
As far as I can tell, no.

44:05.520 --> 44:06.360
All right.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.560
And as far as he can tell, no.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.680
And that is a good thing.

44:09.680 --> 44:13.880
So we are, with that being said,

44:13.880 --> 44:15.560
we are super interested.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.080
We would love to play Mothership.

44:17.080 --> 44:20.200
It's, as far as I understand, a space RPG,

44:20.200 --> 44:21.480
which we've all been talking about

44:21.520 --> 44:24.020
if you wanna play a space thing sometime.

44:24.020 --> 44:25.480
Yeah, we would love to play it.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.240
Yeah, hey, Sean.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.060
Take us to your GM.

44:31.140 --> 44:32.520
Hey, Sean, hit us up.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.680
That was a robot, but it was an alien.

44:38.060 --> 44:40.960
Banstu says, for Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin,

44:40.960 --> 44:42.200
uh-oh, I will-

44:42.200 --> 44:43.040
Shut up, Zach.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.440
Let us read it.

44:44.440 --> 44:46.240
For Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin,

44:46.240 --> 44:48.640
can you tell us what happened in season one?

44:48.640 --> 44:50.320
Zach, how would you describe it?

44:50.320 --> 44:52.320
Oh, this is a, all right.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.680
So we're gonna cut to-

44:53.680 --> 44:57.360
An hour each of recaps from all of us.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.960
I think it would take even longer.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.360
We're gonna skip this one.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.840
My dude, it would not take me longer and an hour

45:04.840 --> 45:08.960
to describe what happened in the season of this podcast.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.640
I think as far as Keith goes,

45:10.640 --> 45:13.560
what you saw was what was going on.

45:13.560 --> 45:16.640
Wow, great answer from Luke.

45:16.640 --> 45:21.120
Luke, what you heard is what you got.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.760
Keith, he didn't like his brother, you know,

45:23.760 --> 45:26.360
and then fast forward, Keith tension.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.520
Justin doesn't need to be here.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.680
That answer applies to all of us, but Joe.

45:32.360 --> 45:37.160
I mean, did you guys expect the goo to when it grabs you

45:37.160 --> 45:38.000
and slams you in the ground?

45:38.000 --> 45:39.800
I didn't expect anything ever.

45:39.800 --> 45:40.640
Did you?

45:42.880 --> 45:45.280
Did you think that it killed you?

45:45.280 --> 45:46.120
Yes.

45:46.440 --> 45:47.800
I had a hunch that it was doing something

45:47.800 --> 45:49.640
because we kept getting pictures from a place

45:49.640 --> 45:50.480
that had no goo.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.480
Yeah, no, it seemed like there was another goo place.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.560
Yeah. Yeah.

45:53.560 --> 45:56.840
But not at all formed like it was.

45:56.840 --> 45:57.680
No.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.800
It seemed way cooler to be honest.

46:00.800 --> 46:01.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:01.880 --> 46:02.840
That's how it works.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.240
Should have killed you before we got there.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.200
Bansu also says,

46:06.200 --> 46:09.960
can you go into a little bit of the goals of each faction

46:09.960 --> 46:11.200
at the start of season one

46:11.200 --> 46:14.200
and how those changed as things evolved?

46:14.240 --> 46:17.280
One of the big changes that I decided to make happen

46:17.280 --> 46:20.360
each time something unnatural occurred in the world

46:20.360 --> 46:24.560
was that I would make Maggie Cook more aggressive,

46:24.560 --> 46:26.600
angrier at her father,

46:26.600 --> 46:29.960
and more dedicated to taking over the world

46:29.960 --> 46:33.280
every single time something fucked up happened.

46:33.280 --> 46:36.640
And so the Maggie Cook that you guys knew

46:36.640 --> 46:40.600
would be different than the Maggie Cook that you talked to

46:40.600 --> 46:43.200
anytime you ran into her for the rest of the time.

46:43.240 --> 46:46.000
And that was attempted to be shown

46:46.000 --> 46:50.360
through her setting up her own fake death,

46:51.560 --> 46:53.280
where someone said like,

46:53.280 --> 46:54.880
oh, she didn't stand up.

46:54.880 --> 46:58.280
She didn't like hold herself the way that Maggie Cook would.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.720
Like someone else was trying to,

46:59.720 --> 47:02.280
Gary Daley was trying to throw like a slight hint there,

47:02.280 --> 47:03.960
which you guys picked up on and were like,

47:03.960 --> 47:06.200
okay, so it might not have been her.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.680
If you guys had actually run dental through Randy Anx

47:10.680 --> 47:13.440
with her teeth files on file,

47:13.440 --> 47:16.800
you would have found out that the corpse was not the same,

47:16.800 --> 47:20.080
did not have the same dental records as Chief Maggie Cook.

47:20.080 --> 47:20.920
Gotcha.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.240
And then when you ran into her

47:22.240 --> 47:25.360
after your time at the Sydney Mausoleum,

47:25.360 --> 47:28.520
you all kind of talked about how aggressive she was

47:28.520 --> 47:30.240
and how angry she was,

47:30.240 --> 47:32.720
which is different than we had talked about

47:32.720 --> 47:35.040
her as a character being previous.

47:35.040 --> 47:35.960
Right, which I was like,

47:35.960 --> 47:37.440
yeah, the real Maggie Cook died

47:37.440 --> 47:38.900
and this is a fake Maggie Cook.

47:38.900 --> 47:41.300
Exactly, but essentially it was just that

47:41.300 --> 47:44.100
each time something wild happened in this world,

47:44.100 --> 47:48.060
you guys were the ones who were kind of split off

47:48.060 --> 47:50.900
along with Stan Manstein, Mildred Mitchell,

47:50.900 --> 47:55.620
certain people who continued on this specific timeline,

47:55.620 --> 47:57.260
trajectory of contention,

47:57.260 --> 48:01.620
as other people continued on the same path of contention

48:01.620 --> 48:02.460
that they were on.

48:02.460 --> 48:03.980
I forgot we were microdosing a lot

48:03.980 --> 48:05.900
when you were writing this campaign.

48:05.900 --> 48:06.740
Yeah.

48:08.900 --> 48:11.020
Zach, were the time loops always planned?

48:11.020 --> 48:13.900
No, did that come about due to the condition

48:13.900 --> 48:15.540
the characters were in by that point?

48:15.540 --> 48:16.620
Yes.

48:16.620 --> 48:17.560
And the microdosing.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.560
And the microdosing.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.640
Also, Zach, I know you mentioned the possibility

48:20.640 --> 48:24.020
if there was enough interest of writing up a setting guide.

48:24.020 --> 48:26.780
So I wanna say I'd be interested in that

48:26.780 --> 48:30.740
and TD underscore Woogie says seconded.

48:30.740 --> 48:34.640
Hey guys, that is a goal that we are considering

48:34.640 --> 48:36.080
putting up on the Patreon

48:36.080 --> 48:40.000
if we're gonna put up a poll soon for patrons

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
to kind of let us know what they're wanting

48:43.000 --> 48:45.160
from pretending to be people moving forward

48:45.160 --> 48:47.920
and that will certainly be one of the options

48:47.920 --> 48:49.960
of things that we should focus on

48:49.960 --> 48:52.480
is writing up a campaign setting for contention,

48:52.480 --> 48:54.160
which I think would be really fun

48:54.160 --> 48:59.160
and also would take an astronomical amount of my time

48:59.360 --> 49:01.400
and I would love to do that

49:01.400 --> 49:03.680
if enough people were interested.

49:03.720 --> 49:07.920
Edgeworth08 says, how different was episode 100 on

49:07.920 --> 49:10.620
from what you initially thought the ending would come to?

49:10.620 --> 49:11.960
How off the rails did it get?

49:11.960 --> 49:12.800
Right on course.

49:12.800 --> 49:14.920
Yeah, that's exactly what I planned.

49:14.920 --> 49:17.440
No, we kind of talked a little bit.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.720
We could talk about it with Justin

49:18.720 --> 49:22.400
when he's on next episode about how I told you guys

49:22.400 --> 49:24.600
I was trying to kill Don D. Pettymore

49:26.160 --> 49:27.640
and it just didn't happen.

49:27.640 --> 49:31.560
Yeah, when you guys were fighting against that rabid ball,

49:31.560 --> 49:35.360
I really wanted to kill Don on the catwalks.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.000
Yeah, that was the one role I ever lied about

49:39.000 --> 49:40.240
and I feel pretty shitty about it,

49:40.240 --> 49:42.280
but I don't actually because it got us, Justin,

49:42.280 --> 49:43.480
through to the end, so.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
But I fudged an unnatural success

49:47.040 --> 49:50.560
because I didn't, I don't know why even.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.800
I'm a weak man.

49:51.800 --> 49:56.800
Oh, I wish that could have been the end of the episode,

50:03.880 --> 50:05.880
but we have to get through more.

50:05.880 --> 50:10.780
Okay, oh, so the answer is that it was very different

50:10.780 --> 50:11.620
than I expected.

50:11.620 --> 50:15.680
I wrote what was gonna happen in the next session

50:15.680 --> 50:17.760
after we played the previous session.

50:17.760 --> 50:21.080
I had literally nothing planned

50:21.080 --> 50:23.640
and I planned as we played

50:23.640 --> 50:25.980
through the end of the entire campaign.

50:25.980 --> 50:26.820
Nice.

50:26.820 --> 50:27.960
Yeah, that's honestly,

50:27.960 --> 50:31.720
if you wanna know how I plan the entire fucking thing

50:31.720 --> 50:35.680
and always have, I plan it based on what happened

50:35.680 --> 50:38.180
the last session every time

50:38.180 --> 50:40.640
because you can't just prep a bunch of stuff

50:40.640 --> 50:42.160
and expect it to work

50:43.640 --> 50:44.720
because it never does.

50:45.080 --> 50:45.900
Nice.

50:47.260 --> 50:49.180
What was the biggest takeaway you got

50:49.180 --> 50:50.600
from making this podcast

50:50.600 --> 50:53.920
and what did you learn to prepare for season two?

50:53.920 --> 50:55.960
Shit's easy, make it up as you go.

50:55.960 --> 50:56.800
Yep.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.040
So more of that coming.

50:59.040 --> 51:03.000
Yeah, the answer you just said from the previous question.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.300
Yeah, but also for sure on season two,

51:06.300 --> 51:07.720
gonna take your guys' advice.

51:07.720 --> 51:10.160
I really liked the idea of, Thomas mentioned,

51:10.160 --> 51:13.080
recapping what you learned from an NPC

51:13.080 --> 51:15.040
after your interactions with them.

51:15.040 --> 51:17.480
We love recaps around here.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.680
I do that with combat, I realized,

51:19.680 --> 51:23.000
where I kind of recap each round what happened in combat

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
and then thankfully later we had characters do it in game.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.080
But yeah, I really liked the idea

51:30.080 --> 51:32.880
of recapping what you guys get from NPCs.

51:32.880 --> 51:35.640
Characters who would have never been there

51:35.640 --> 51:38.400
if I hadn't heroically lied

51:40.340 --> 51:42.600
while Zach tried to murder us on those catwalks.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.700
Murder Justin on those catwalks.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.400
Right guys?

51:48.520 --> 51:50.520
Biggest takeaway from making the podcast?

51:50.520 --> 51:51.480
Shit's easy.

51:51.480 --> 51:53.320
Shit's easy, just make it up as you go.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.160
Make it up as you go.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.480
It was fun for me.

51:57.340 --> 52:00.320
Editing is really hard and takes a long time.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.160
Yeah.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.460
And is really important.

52:04.460 --> 52:06.280
Finally, I just wanted to say

52:06.280 --> 52:08.560
that when I finally saw your faces,

52:08.560 --> 52:10.720
I had a completely different image

52:10.720 --> 52:12.760
from what you sounded like, except for Luke.

52:12.760 --> 52:15.800
I thought, quote, yeah, that's about right.

52:17.320 --> 52:18.240
It's, yeah, it's true.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.240
I mean, we sound like normal people,

52:21.240 --> 52:25.400
but we're all devastatingly attractive except for Luke.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.280
No, they just could tell from my voice.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.580
They're like that guy.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.920
They say great stuff, guys.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.760
What confidence that man has.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.520
And I look forward to more content.

52:34.520 --> 52:37.760
Tall idiot Milky Way at ShadowWorldVivo.

52:37.760 --> 52:38.880
Oh, we're on Twitter.

52:39.840 --> 52:42.080
It must have hashtag PTBPQ.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.240
Love the podcast.

52:43.240 --> 52:45.440
I've listened through all of it twice.

52:47.760 --> 52:49.880
That's hundreds of hours.

52:49.880 --> 52:50.720
Double hundreds.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.060
Double, double.

52:52.060 --> 52:54.240
What did the myriads mean at the end

52:54.240 --> 52:56.600
when they were saying, quote, for your own safety,

52:56.600 --> 52:58.880
please remain here?

52:58.880 --> 53:02.360
Did they think shutting down Overseer and Ball

53:02.360 --> 53:03.600
was a safe choice?

53:03.600 --> 53:04.840
I was curious about this one too,

53:04.840 --> 53:05.920
because on the re-listen,

53:05.920 --> 53:08.320
you really hit home with that a bunch of times.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.800
Was there a hint there that we didn't pick up on?

53:10.800 --> 53:13.280
No, it was simply the thing that I kept hammering home

53:13.280 --> 53:15.580
is that it's really fucking dangerous

53:15.580 --> 53:18.960
for you guys to try to go back into the world

53:18.960 --> 53:21.120
that Myriad was about to shut down,

53:21.120 --> 53:23.380
was kind of the vibe that I was trying to give you.

53:23.380 --> 53:25.240
Basically, find another option,

53:25.240 --> 53:29.080
which you did in the weirdest way that I was not expecting.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.200
But yeah, I was saying like,

53:31.200 --> 53:33.920
if you go back to contention,

53:33.920 --> 53:36.440
I am going to make you blip out of existence

53:36.440 --> 53:39.760
because Myriad will erase your entire plane,

53:39.760 --> 53:42.600
which includes all iterations of contention.

53:42.600 --> 53:43.440
Sure.

53:43.440 --> 53:44.540
I guess I assumed at the time

53:44.540 --> 53:46.620
that also meant the place we were in, right?

53:46.620 --> 53:47.460
The same.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.280
Okay, I did too.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.440
I thought for your own safety, please remain here.

53:51.440 --> 53:52.560
We'll wipe you all out.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.280
I was like, you're lying.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.240
I thought it was a threat.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.780
Nope, they were definitely gonna just leave you there.

53:57.780 --> 53:58.620
Okay.

53:58.620 --> 54:01.120
In my head, that's what I had planned.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.280
That we could have lived in existence there.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.120
Yep. Gotcha.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.880
You definitely could have lived in existence there.

54:06.240 --> 54:07.280
A great fun one.

54:07.280 --> 54:09.080
So yeah, they were basically just saying,

54:09.080 --> 54:10.080
for your own safety,

54:10.080 --> 54:14.540
because jumping to a new plane is really hard.

54:14.540 --> 54:16.120
And we kind of talked about that

54:16.120 --> 54:19.040
after we recorded a couple of times where it was like,

54:19.040 --> 54:20.160
what would have happened

54:20.160 --> 54:22.480
if you guys would have tried to jump planes?

54:22.480 --> 54:26.220
And I had a table that you would have rolled on

54:26.220 --> 54:29.520
and the options were mostly bad.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.840
Yeah.

54:30.840 --> 54:33.120
My favorite that I was really pulling for

54:33.120 --> 54:38.120
was going to be a very luscious, verdant, green jungle

54:39.280 --> 54:41.160
that then you all would have slowly died

54:41.160 --> 54:45.200
of radiation poisoning and maybe at the jaws of dinosaurs.

54:45.200 --> 54:47.400
So yeah, there were different places.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.440
Well, that's not my favorite.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.200
That you could have ended up

54:51.200 --> 54:52.040
if you had to try to leave.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.840
Gazebo, a wild gazebo says,

54:54.840 --> 54:59.260
I for one look forward to our new lives under Keith's rule.

54:59.260 --> 55:02.840
I'm sure he'll be a kind and a holy empathetic leader.

55:03.400 --> 55:06.200
All hail Keith's, hallowed be thy name.

55:06.200 --> 55:07.040
Hallowed be thy name.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.280
Looks like the Keiths myriad

55:08.280 --> 55:10.360
have taken over some Twitter accounts

55:10.360 --> 55:13.800
and are spreading some disinfo.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.800
Bless you, my son.

55:15.800 --> 55:18.700
Lynn is spooky at Jet Sedette says,

55:18.700 --> 55:21.040
shout out to the handsome boy, Luke.

55:21.040 --> 55:25.360
Hashtag HZKMP, hashtag PTBPQ, smiley face.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.600
Keep it up.

55:26.600 --> 55:29.320
Another Keith on Twitter.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.800
Who is that really, Keith?

55:31.800 --> 55:32.840
I don't know who that is.

55:32.840 --> 55:35.920
Sasha Snow, one of our fantastic mods,

55:35.920 --> 55:38.240
at MariexLupin says,

55:38.240 --> 55:43.240
so when y'all releasing the hot dog cut of No Backbone.

55:43.320 --> 55:45.320
Amazing job on season one.

55:45.320 --> 55:47.800
I can't wait for the next season to kick off.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.160
We can't either.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.360
We're excited for everything

55:50.360 --> 55:51.480
that's coming down the pipeline.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.480
Super stoked, super stoked.

55:54.360 --> 55:56.880
I'll release the hot dog cut of No Backbone

55:56.880 --> 55:59.880
with the permission of Kudzu on Patreon.

56:00.440 --> 56:02.600
I'll actually, that's a great question.

56:02.600 --> 56:05.840
I'll hit up Seth, who's the lead singer of Kudzu,

56:05.840 --> 56:09.800
and see if he's cool with me releasing the hot dog cut,

56:09.800 --> 56:13.240
which he will not know what I'm talking about.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.560
So I'll send it to him and then we'll,

56:15.560 --> 56:18.840
thankfully the season's over, so he can't pull out now.

56:21.080 --> 56:26.040
Kyanite fuck cars at 1312 Kyanite asks,

56:26.040 --> 56:28.560
do y'all have a secret to not getting burnt out

56:28.600 --> 56:31.800
on the same story, adventure, system, et cetera,

56:31.800 --> 56:34.320
other than reasonable and restful breaks?

56:34.320 --> 56:38.480
Those are for babies and I am no baby.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.640
I am a baby, I took a break.

56:40.640 --> 56:41.480
We took big breaks.

56:41.480 --> 56:43.000
We took a big break, yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.080
We took a couple of big breaks.

56:44.080 --> 56:46.880
We started recording this season in contention

56:46.880 --> 56:49.920
a full year before we started releasing,

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
we've said a few times.

56:50.920 --> 56:54.320
So I mean, there were many breaks in there,

56:54.320 --> 56:57.440
but I'm curious, did you guys ever feel burnt out

56:57.440 --> 56:58.480
on the story?

56:59.360 --> 57:00.760
No, because it just changed.

57:00.760 --> 57:02.000
It was a consistent thread,

57:02.000 --> 57:03.840
but so many other things where it's like.

57:03.840 --> 57:05.720
We had the luxury of those mini arcs also

57:05.720 --> 57:06.560
to break it all up.

57:06.560 --> 57:08.880
Actually, yeah, by the time we got to the numbers

57:08.880 --> 57:11.920
and everything without a lot of even hints

57:11.920 --> 57:13.920
about what was actually going on.

57:13.920 --> 57:17.520
Yeah, that arc was, I mean, like about that

57:17.520 --> 57:18.720
in the world in general.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.920
Though I don't know if you guys had more than I did

57:20.920 --> 57:22.920
at that point with your characters.

57:22.920 --> 57:24.280
I didn't know anything.

57:24.280 --> 57:26.920
Joe is definitely learning that he was the overseer

57:26.920 --> 57:27.800
during that arc.

57:27.840 --> 57:30.520
And so that was a very Joe centric.

57:30.520 --> 57:32.600
There was also a moment where the entire story

57:32.600 --> 57:36.040
could have changed because Leon wanted to take me elsewhere

57:36.040 --> 57:37.840
and I had some kind of role that I succeeded

57:37.840 --> 57:38.800
and or failed on.

57:38.800 --> 57:41.440
He said, you know what, let's not do that yet

57:41.440 --> 57:44.040
and let's do the city campus first.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.600
If I had gone to the other place,

57:45.600 --> 57:46.840
I guess we're in spoiler territory.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.560
He wanted to take me straight to Comcomfy Campground

57:49.560 --> 57:50.520
and meet up with Maggie.

57:50.520 --> 57:53.400
Meet up with Maggie who was waiting for you on the shore

57:53.400 --> 57:58.400
with a heavy metal box that would have summoned

58:00.480 --> 58:04.000
the Gigantum Barpithecus into the world of contention

58:04.000 --> 58:07.800
and her plan was alongside the overseer, you,

58:07.800 --> 58:10.400
was to hold the world hostage

58:10.400 --> 58:15.000
and literally take control of a one world government.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.960
You guys could have had a very different overseer.

58:20.680 --> 58:23.080
Yeah, I mean, obviously I love the story that we crafted

58:23.720 --> 58:24.560
but that's way better.

58:26.880 --> 58:29.360
So secret to not getting burnt out, I guess,

58:29.360 --> 58:32.320
is just to keep the story fresh and moving

58:32.320 --> 58:34.440
in different directions constantly.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.160
That makes me remember that also even after the fact,

58:37.160 --> 58:38.520
when I came back from one of the loops,

58:38.520 --> 58:41.280
I was trying to convince them to go to Comcomfy Campground.

58:41.280 --> 58:43.120
We had another chance to have done that.

58:43.120 --> 58:47.440
I was also planning on that happening, yeah, for a while.

58:47.440 --> 58:52.440
Spine Bazinglingter at Putnam Puppeteer says,

58:52.480 --> 58:55.440
it seemed that there was an uneasy truce

58:55.440 --> 58:59.080
between the Circle of Knowledge, Coq, Myriad

58:59.080 --> 59:02.120
and the majority of factions in the series

59:02.120 --> 59:05.880
with the possible exception of the Glass Syndicate.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.760
Was this unity an allied powers-esque counter

59:09.760 --> 59:11.880
to MARY's agenda?

59:11.880 --> 59:16.320
No, MARY was the allies and everybody else was the ISIS.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.160
Yeah.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.480
Yeah.

59:20.520 --> 59:23.800
I like to think that Myriad and the Circle of Knowledge,

59:23.800 --> 59:26.560
Bar Corp, they were all kind of working together.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.520
You had an NPC kind of say that one time

59:28.520 --> 59:30.960
that they're all moving in different ways

59:30.960 --> 59:31.800
toward the same goal.

59:31.800 --> 59:34.720
Yeah, and Love was talking to you guys about that

59:34.720 --> 59:38.000
outside of Beans Pond and that is true.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.640
MARY was not a part of that agenda.

59:40.640 --> 59:43.780
Everyone was pretty confused about the balls

59:43.780 --> 59:47.440
and how they work and no one had a grasp on it

59:47.440 --> 59:49.000
was my thought process.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.040
There are a couple other balls that are out there

59:52.040 --> 59:55.960
in this world that were never found

59:55.960 --> 59:58.600
and I never wrote anything for them

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.240
because I didn't. Make it up right now.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.480
Didn't think I needed to.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.480
They're out there, baby.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.840
Yeah, they're fucking out there though.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.680
If you do the math, there were a certain amount

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.680
of successes, Kacelle knocked out a certain number of them,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.380
John was one of them and yeah, the math doesn't quite add up

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.880
there's one or two I think that are left out.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.720
Nice.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.560
And so they're still doing this stuff.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.080
Take some time to feel your spine right now.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.840
Also, keep in mind if you're stoned

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.240
and you're listening to this and it's late at night

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.920
and it's dark and you're in your house by yourself,

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.000
don't look out the window

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.360
because there's someone looking at you.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:36.640
Yeah, and your ball.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.520
That's right, Derek.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.620
There's someone looking at you through the window.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.620
Also, Tyler, shut your door right now, then lock it.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.700
Xylopia or, well, no, it's gotta be that, right?

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.660
Xylopia maybe?

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.620
Oh yeah, probably.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.860
Xylopia.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.340
Question, what can you tell us about season two?

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.180
Nothing.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.000
Nothing.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.840
Nothing, but we are talking about it.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.680
Who the fuck told you that?

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.520
I'll tell you about season two.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.100
How do you know about that?

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.540
How do you know about season two?

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.060
That wasn't supposed to leave this room.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:11.900
Codename season two.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:12.740
I think it's worth saying

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.380
that you've done a lot of work on it already.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:15.820
Yeah, it is.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:19.180
It's worth saying that I remembered a couple months ago,

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.460
contention in the main story and everything,

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.980
like with the NPCs that would be moving parts

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.420
were all written out well before we started recording.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.780
And I was like, oh shit, I gotta get on this.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.700
So I've had the idea rumbling around in my head

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.380
for season two since, I would say,

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.220
when we were recording episode 12.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.220
Nice.

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.920
And I've kind of fine-tuned it.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.020
Taylor has worked as my story supervisor

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.180
to basically me talking out loud

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.720
and her being like, that doesn't make sense.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.560
Let's fix that.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.580
And so. Nice.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.900
Yeah, I'm really, really fucking excited about it.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.740
So that's what we can tell you.

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.300
What were you watching a lot of at that point in time?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.460
Oh, that's a good question.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.940
What was I watching?

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.860
Gilligan's Island.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.960
Fucking one show you were so into.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.020
Whoa.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.220
The magic thing.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.060
Oh. Who?

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.900
Mr. Strange, wait, what was it?

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.060
Jonathan Norrell?

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.440
Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.280
Yeah.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.100
It's pretty good.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.240
Yeah, I think it's really fun.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.240
There's a Faye, and I'm not really super into Faye lore,

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.740
but I really like that story.

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.580
And the acting is really solid in it.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.860
Yeah, definitely.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.360
Dirk Gilligan had a lot to do with season one.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:40.820
John dies at the end, had a lot to do with season one.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.660
A lot of stuff.

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.340
Anytime I'm watching media or listening to media,

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:45.820
I'm stealing.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.900
Question, would you guys ever consider playing a season

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:53.300
of Scum and Villainy or some other spacey flavor

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.420
of tabletop role-playing?

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.380
C Mothership.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.900
Yeah, C colon Mothership.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.060
Yeah, for sure.

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.660
I've heard Scum and Villainy is dope.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.140
Is Scum and Villainy the Star Wars one specifically?

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.980
Yeah, I think it is not name brand,

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.260
but it is essentially, do you want to role play Star Wars?

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.300
This is a way to do it.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.140
Cool.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.500
And I would, you know what I would call it

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.660
the whole time we were playing it?

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.840
What?

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.420
Scum and Villainy.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.260
Oh, okay.

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:21.880
Zach, oh, okay.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.780
Compliment, this is one of my favorite podcasts.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:33.220
PTBP is my only Patreon subscription at the moment.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.180
Hey, thank you.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.620
We encourage you to divest as much if you're welcome

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.500
as you can from other sources

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.860
and invest it all in PTBP.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.020
It's going up and up and up and up, baby.

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.780
Diamond hands on PTBP.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.980
That's right, you hold.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:50.980
It only goes up.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.100
1KL, oh no.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.660
1KL Island.

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.620
No, 1K Island.

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:01.300
Oh, 1000 Island Stare, 1000 Island Stare.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.260
Yep, 1K Island Stare.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.100
Come town joke.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:07.060
Says, what was Maggie Cook's agenda?

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.300
What was the schism in the circle of knowledge?

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.500
Really all about.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.980
Her relationship with her father depreciated in value

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.280
every single time something unnatural happened

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.220
and that is what led her to come up with the idea

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.980
to dethrone him and take over the circle of knowledge.

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.920
So there were unnatural things happening

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.580
before we blipped into existence as characters.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.420
That is correct.

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.500
Because we found a bunch of notes about that schism

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.820
happening previous to us.

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.780
Gotcha, cool.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.020
Yeah.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:40.100
Modern Cannabis asks,

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.060
what was the deal with Joe's parents?

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.580
Why did they get the book?

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.760
What was the deal with their hinting him

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.380
about letters slash Wheel of Fortune?

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.660
I may just have spaced something.

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.620
What happened the day Joe was in the library?

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.440
I don't know what the deal with Clark's parents is,

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.780
but what's the deal with Joe's parents?

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.620
Like Joe's parents, it's a whole ass episode.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:04.260
Yeah, we would need some time.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.500
You'll have to ask why they got the book

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.780
or answer why they got the book.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.020
I can tell you what I think of as the day in the library

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:16.020
was Clark Old, the overseer, protecting young Clark

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.660
and knowing that that was a timeline

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.780
that needed to continue.

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.240
And that's why he chained the doors closed

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.020
and created a distraction, a diversion

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:29.020
to get the myriad away from those doors.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.300
Oh my God, dude, that was so cool.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.820
I just threw the vague back to Luke and mid answer,

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.760
Joe just like snagged it out of the air one handed

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.660
and then handed it to Luke and continued answering

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.020
until we couldn't hold it in anymore.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.380
That was good, because it was like,

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.520
really good answer though.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.380
And the deal with Joe's parents is just simply,

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.860
they had the book, don't fucking worry about it.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.860
It's called the McGuffins.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.900
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.180
My own thoughts on the way that his story,

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.340
that Clark and the overseer storyline ended

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:10.580
is that he was gonna go back and put the pieces in place

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.780
that then set them in motion to end up where they ended up.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.940
So the book had to end up with Joe's parents.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.060
Is that a TV trope?

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.180
With Clark's parents.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.180
And yes, you're 100% right about the day

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.320
that Clark was in the library as a child.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.100
That is exactly what the overseer was there to do.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.140
But the overseer was always being chased by myriad.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.740
So let me hit the ATM.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.740
A great user name, says, well done guys.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.580
Thank you.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.400
Thanks.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.240
Thanks.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.080
Thank you.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:42.900
It's been a fun ride.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:43.740
Thank you.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:44.580
Thank you.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.400
Thanks.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.240
Thank you.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.300
My question is, what, if any,

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.220
meaning did the actual vocal portion of the spells

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:51.180
throughout the show have?

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.320
Like, were they a specific language?

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.900
Did they mean something aside from the spell?

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.600
And the answer is slightly.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:03.460
Yeah, I used a Google translate to take words

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.220
that I thought were meaningful to the spell.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:12.060
And then I Google translated them into fucking Swedish

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.080
and then Arabic and then French and then Spanish

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.240
and then Indonesian and then Dutch.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.940
And just like somewhere along the line,

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.700
pulled out a syllable or two that I liked

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.160
and then did it with the next word

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.420
that also worked toward that spell.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.880
So if it was like time backwards,

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.280
then I would do it with those two words

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.280
and then put those combination of syllables together.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.960
And that's how I came up with the spell.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.800
Yeah.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.480
So that's how we used hyper geometry in season one.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.480
And I've been working on my magic engine for season two.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.040
And I'm pretty stoked about it.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:52.880
So.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.840
And I did the same with to do hakanu.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.220
Bacon Monkey says, listener from Thailand here.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.460
Thank you.

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.280
Whoa.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.120
That's awesome.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:04.960
Very cool.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.200
And I love season one and congratulations

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.940
on finishing it on such a high note.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:08.780
Thank you.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.600
Thank you.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.440
Thank you.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.280
Thank you.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.100
Thank you.

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:12.940
Thank you.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:14.220
My question is a bit more pertaining

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.460
to the behind the scenes stuff,

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.220
but I wanted to know how you guys approach

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.020
the various topics or directions

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:21.100
that the characters will go through.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.420
I know a lot of the twists were surprises

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.960
and I was wondering if you guys had to talk beforehand

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.380
regarding what topics to avoid

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.700
or if certain subjects were too sensitive for some people,

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.580
or if a player didn't like a certain direction

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:38.140
that the handler took their character down

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.580
because it seemed like everyone took all the surprises

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:44.100
in stride and strove to continue the story with them.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.060
And that really stood out to me.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.740
Excuse my shitty English, which.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.580
Your English was great.

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.980
Your English was phenomenal.

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.980
Alc underscore the underscore missed also added

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.300
your English is fine.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.260
Thanks for popping in there to reassure

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:00.920
this poster. Thanks.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.760
Yeah, for sure.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.420
So let's hit some of these points in here.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.420
We do talk about some stuff before,

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.660
like, do we want to, like,

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:10.140
we discuss some content beforehand,

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.500
not necessarily like surprises that are going to happen

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.360
to the characters that keeps that from us,

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.500
but like we have pretty like serious

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.540
and thoughtful discussions about what we do

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:20.900
and don't want on the show.

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.740
Yeah.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.320
We definitely have one-on-ones with Zach too

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.780
that are like, hey, here's what I'm thinking.

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.620
Exactly.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.440
He'll do that.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.020
Like I want to kind of do this with your character maybe

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:28.860
or whatever.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.680
Yeah.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.900
Which even pre-recording,

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.940
I specifically remember one day at work,

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.460
I was, I texted all three of you when I was working

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:41.460
the shitty job and I took my lunch break so seriously.

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.720
And I would, I was at the time,

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.620
I was just spending my lunch breaks,

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:51.500
reading every post on the R slash Call of Cthulhu

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.380
and R slash Delta Green subreddits.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:56.100
I went to top all time.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.480
And I read for like 10 pages on both of those,

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.260
just consuming as much content as I could

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:07.280
to try to try to get more info on how to be good at this.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.220
But I texted you guys something about your characters

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.620
and Joe texted me back immediately.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.180
And then we literally started like role-playing

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.860
like a solo thing with his character over text message

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:24.700
on my lunch break to prepare for like the next session

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.540
that was happening.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.020
So sick.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:31.460
Yeah, okay, you guys sexted, that's good brag.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.340
There's also a part of the question that says,

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.860
if a player didn't like a certain direction

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.380
that the handler was taking their character down,

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.160
I never felt that way, but I also always felt comfortable

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.520
if I needed to, to tell you that.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.580
I think you were receptive to anything we said.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.040
And I think there have been a couple of moments

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.420
where we're like, I don't,

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:49.940
I can't think of anything in particular,

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.840
but it does feel like maybe we've done that.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.220
Yeah, I feel like at least before we recorded,

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.960
there might've even been a couple of times

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.480
where just mid campaign,

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.340
you might come up to me and be like, hey.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.180
I'm Irish now.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.020
I'm Irish now.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.600
Meaning to talk more about it in character,

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.860
if you could kind of prompt it in the role-playing.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.420
Like Joe said, that's my hope obviously,

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.720
is that you guys feel comfortable coming to me

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.800
with any concerns that you have.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.880
There's nothing so sacred that I would feel

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.040
like I couldn't say, hey,

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.660
I don't know if this is what I want.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.700
I hope you feel comfortable coming to me,

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.600
Zach lustily texted Joe.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.300
Luke and Thomas read Joe and Zach's sex ASMR style.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.360
Yeah, that's the ultimate Patreon goal.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.900
Yeah.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.880
And then as far as like hot topics go,

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.520
we've been friends for a long time and like-

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.560
We all know kind of.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.000
Yeah, we know our boundaries, I think.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.860
Oh yeah, we also wouldn't be friends

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.500
if we didn't have like the same general values.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.980
Yeah.

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.300
I like respect you guys as people.

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.140
Yeah.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.660
And I wouldn't, if you were gonna joke about stuff

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.180
that I wasn't comfortable with.

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.300
Yeah, for sure.

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.540
All people as people.

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.140
Exactly, which is-

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.140
It's a really, really basic concept.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.900
It's like so simple.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.600
It's just like really, really easy and super cool to do.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.260
Jacob pegging, nope.

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.500
I see where you're going for there.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.660
Jacob pepping.

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:29.300
Pepping, Jacob pepping just says,

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.220
love the show, only actual play to really grab me

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.940
and drag me down into the ooze and never let me go.

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:36.780
Thank you.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.620
Thank you.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.440
Erotic.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.280
Yeah, that's great.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.680
If everyone had to pick a moment from the show,

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.520
what would it be?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.980
Coolest, funniest, most memorable, or just most nuts?

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.520
There's tons.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.740
Most recently.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.940
Yeah, man.

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:51.980
The Keith turn.

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.420
I think the Keith turn had us all like dying.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.260
It was incredible.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.300
That was nuts.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.340
Yeah, that was so fucking insane.

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.300
That was a really, that was a really good one.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:04.620
The death of Anne Love.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.180
I was gonna say that for me, for sure.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:10.020
Really important, the way that that all went down

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.940
and the fight with John and Clark,

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:16.940
like the roles just happened the way that told a fun story.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.080
Yeah.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.240
I really loved the robot fight we had.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.600
I was like, dude, this is sick.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.440
That was one of the most intense things, I think,

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.540
like as a player that I felt like-

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:29.560
Are you talking about in the house?

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.580
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.200
Where I was like, oh, we're gonna die.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.040
Like this is-

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.520
Yeah, yeah, right, totally.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.320
I don't know how to fight this robot.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.720
Your guys' eyes, like each of your eyes,

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.360
when I described the top half of that robot

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.080
breaking off from the bottom half,

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.320
probably like put another plus five years

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.920
of role-playing for Zach, like.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.760
Yep.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.280
I'm chasing those eyes.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.600
I saw the look in their eyes

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.440
and I've been chasing that feeling ever since.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.280
And you gave us just an old man

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.040
shitting himself the whole time, too?

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.880
Yeah.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.400
Not the plan I had for Randy Angst.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.840
You guys were so aggressive about the guns with him.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.360
That seems like so long ago.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.400
It was so long ago we did that, but that was dope.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.120
Thomas, is there like a moment

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.640
from the season one of pretending to be people

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.980
that when you think about the show,

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.720
like reaches out to you as a particular moment?

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.800
No, I'm way more into the later seasons.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.000
Well, for me, for you as a role player,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.080
I can think of two specifically.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.720
One, Martin Cupertino, trying to convince the group

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:42.680
that he was in the right about where to go

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:43.780
when you guys were in the woods

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.340
and looking for the door.

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:50.340
And you had a much lower skill in survival

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.100
than the alternative,

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.060
which was the archeologist played by Joe.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:58.900
Whose name was?

01:14:58.900 --> 01:14:59.720
I don't remember his name.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.560
I don't either.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.400
I don't either.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.660
And it was not Angela.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.340
Angie, Angie, Angie.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.600
Which that cracked me up when I was like,

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.300
hey, can I name your wife, Angela?

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.840
And you're like, yeah, whatever, whatever you want to do.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.040
And then I was like, ha ha ha.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.040
It's Anne Love, motherfucker, mommy fucker.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.280
If I remember right, did that reveal happen

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.240
off the podcast, didn't it?

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.080
To me.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.720
Oh, I think it might've.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.040
I think it might've.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:29.760
I think I wasn't recording when you put two and two together.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.760
Gloating three AMS, by the way, idiot.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.840
Idiot.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.960
Shouldn't have let me name your wife.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.640
And then the other one for Thomas is,

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.320
when you decided that,

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.560
when you passed a sanity check in the Old West Arc

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.480
and you said, no, I don't want to be sane,

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.520
and then just grabbed the head of the preacher,

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.000
chair of Dr. Bobby Custard,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and started moving his mouth and talking through his head.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.980
That was another.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.560
Thanks.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.680
And then additionally, I'll throw up one more

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.320
just because we're on the topic and I'm thinking of it.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.680
When you threw Drew Andrews against the wall,

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.040
when it was just me and you,

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.560
and you threatened his life.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.880
Oh, yeah.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.020
If he fucked you over on the cocaine deal,

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:27.680
that was really intense.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.520
By the way, Drew-

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.080
I just thought about what I would do to you, Zach,

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:34.500
if you tried to screw me out of our cocaine deal.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.220
Drew was not adamant,

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.940
but he did throw out the idea top of like,

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:45.260
okay, so this much money split four ways.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.500
And Thomas was like, no.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.360
Two ways, Drew.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.660
Drew was definitely, in my head,

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.860
like I thought I was going to be able to rope all of you

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.340
into being the worst fucking cops.

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.140
Oh, which you did on your own for the most part.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.560
Keith would have probably been in,

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.320
but then when we found Fergie Beans,

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.500
it might've just instantly gone to gunfire.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.860
Oh, that would have been-

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.020
That would have been really cool.

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.520
That was the reveal that I was hoping for

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.900
is the four of you out there for a drug deal

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:19.520
and then Keith's fucking brother shows up

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.020
with a van full of android kids.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.980
At the same time, imagine the Keith that we know

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.220
is essentially the villain of this whole story.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.700
Definitely the villain of this whole story.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.260
Getting like a million dollars and some change

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.380
to fund those dreams earlier than, you know,

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.980
then he might've otherwise realized them.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.300
I don't think it's a, it wouldn't be prudent.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.460
It wouldn't be prudent.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.820
To quote a relevant and popular sketch

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.840
from a relevant and popular show.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.280
A highlight of Keith was being Silas Cole.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.780
Yes, that was super fucking fun.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.260
The orchestration of his brother's murder.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.580
Yeah, that was really fucking good.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.400
Your Wild West character was also fantastic.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.560
Ephraim Corland and then the turn that Ephraim

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.140
got to take where you got got first

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.180
and then were able to take them down

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:19.740
is another key role-playing moment that-

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.140
That was great.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:23.260
That actually is like, I was like,

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.300
oh my fucking God, I'm such a goddamn idiot.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.180
I'm the dumbest man alive.

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.980
Man, being a player is fucking hard.

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.540
Come on guys, come on in and look at this.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:40.780
Like in D&D, you literally played the hero of the story

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:45.060
and you know that like the story is on your side.

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:48.540
Right, in Delta Green, you're not like supposed to win.

01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:50.700
No, anything you do.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:52.560
This is why DMs like it so much

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.780
because it's literally like, yeah, like maybe they'll win,

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:56.900
but it's still gonna let you get

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.300
your sick little rocks off.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.180
That's why he brought bringing us back.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.020
He still gets to tell the man, really do it somehow.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.660
It's like, I killed him, yes.

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.060
Oh no, what have I done?

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.860
Post kill clarity.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.100
I gotta bring him back, I gotta bring him back.

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:17.300
Load up the mausoleum.

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.340
So thank you all so much for listening

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.460
through this first Q&A.

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.060
We're gonna do one more to finish out

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.420
the rest of these questions that everybody asked.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:30.060
I think we got through exactly half of them.

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.060
Yeah, hell yeah, we got through exactly half

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.920
and we'll come back with Justin next week

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.500
to answer the remaining questions that you all have

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.180
and thank you.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.020
Thanks for listening.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:40.980
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.820
If you've listened this far, whoa.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.100
Whoa.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.760
Yeah, whoa and also do tune in next week

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.420
with the exciting conclusion

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.460
of the question Zach was gonna ask us.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:54.980
Oh yeah, I haven't been teased it.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.300
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you guys.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.940
I'm gonna eat a woman, a woman.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.580
Sorry, sorry."

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:01.500
I know you really can't.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.240
Another one, there's a scene where you videos

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.460
pace game sort of tennis cinematography.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.540
That's different from competing to competing.

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:11.220
It would be insane if we missed several videos

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.300
with some contradictoryuns.

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.640
I thought that was just funny to me too.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.080
That's right, we got O Edge on theMoment.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.460
What do you think about O Edge?

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.700
O Edge, the moment of that edict Jesse

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.040
or whatever your point is,

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.580
where'd the audience go?

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:32.340
How am I the only one trying to fool all?

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:41.340
How can you have enough drowning out of the notes?

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:47.340
There's no point in going.

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:55.340
No point going.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:58.340
Fly to fly to stream.
