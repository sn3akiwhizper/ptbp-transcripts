Welcome. Please enter my future listeners.

00:04.300 --> 00:15.900
It's your new obsession, Wolf the Dog, and I'm crawling deeper and deeper into your ear holes from 694.2 PTBP,

00:15.900 --> 00:23.900
the newest, best, and only radio station in a very real town called Contention.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.400
Tune in to our hit show, Pretended to be People,

00:27.400 --> 00:30.700
to hear three bumbling police officers.

00:30.700 --> 00:31.800
Keith Vigna,

00:31.800 --> 00:35.300
I'm not a bad cop, I'm just a bad cop.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.400
John Lee Pettymore IV,

00:37.400 --> 00:39.300
I fire my pistol into the air.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.000
and Clark Bishop,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.200
Can we call the president?

00:43.200 --> 00:51.400
as they struggle against their own incompetence in a futile attempt to save their small town from an ineffable threat.

00:51.400 --> 01:04.500
The limp bodies, after sliding into a pool of their own blood, are picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an absurd rate by some unseen force.

01:04.500 --> 01:10.300
And then, as if they were never there at all, both bodies are gone.

01:10.300 --> 01:14.300
All while navigating some unique citizens.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.800
A cold chill runs down Clark's spine.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.400
It's a fucking cat man!

01:18.400 --> 01:20.600
Surreal horror.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.800
It was somebody who knew I watched Wheel of Fortune every night.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.700
And gruesome crime scenes.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.900
The skin on her back was branded with the phrase,

01:29.900 --> 01:31.600
This is a fool.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.600
And the cause of death was blunt trauma.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.800
Hell yeah, dude.

01:38.700 --> 01:46.500
Keep in mind, Pretending to be People is available wherever you listen to podcasts.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.100
So come on down to Contention.

01:49.100 --> 02:00.700
Join your new grown-ass man-pet-friend-narrator DJ Wolf the Dog in this greasy dumpster filled with deliciously wet nibbles.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.200
And enjoy Pretending to be People.

02:19.100 --> 02:24.000
Thanks for watching!
