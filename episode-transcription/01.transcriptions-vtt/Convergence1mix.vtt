WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Howdy, my friends and foes.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.880
It's the titan of Tennessee, Wolf the dog.

00:06.880 --> 00:11.420
And I am coming at you live from Groversville?

00:11.420 --> 00:14.060
Now how the fuck did I end up here?

00:14.060 --> 00:15.440
Wolf, dammit.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.200
I guess I'll still do my best to give y'all

00:18.200 --> 00:23.200
a wonderful show here at 694.2 PTBP.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.460
This barn smells like shit,

00:26.460 --> 00:29.080
but not that good kind of stank.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.440
That bad stank.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.240
Something weird is going on around here.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.840
Anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf

00:37.840 --> 00:41.240
is from at necro wang on Twitter,

00:41.240 --> 00:45.320
who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod,

00:45.320 --> 00:47.740
which is a rad thing to do regardless

00:47.740 --> 00:51.280
of if you have a necro wang, a bio wang,

00:51.280 --> 00:55.680
or any sort of wang in between, they write.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.660
Hello, Wolf the dog.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.300
How are you today?

00:59.300 --> 01:03.260
It's a true honor for you to read my words on your show.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.700
May I take this moment to speak with you,

01:05.700 --> 01:09.300
oh magnificent beast of the festering heap

01:09.300 --> 01:13.620
about the king in yellow and his most radiant church.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.960
Our king has feelings, Wolf.

01:15.960 --> 01:20.180
He's happy when we're happy and sad when we're suffering.

01:20.180 --> 01:24.060
He wants us to talk to him through prayer and through plays.

01:24.060 --> 01:27.500
And he wants to talk back and stand before us.

01:28.340 --> 01:32.340
So, my sewer surfing and delightfully grimy friend,

01:32.340 --> 01:35.100
may I invite you to our king's gala,

01:35.100 --> 01:39.260
yours truly, servant of our king in yellow,

01:39.260 --> 01:44.260
Layered Christopher at necro wang on Twitter.

01:44.300 --> 01:48.380
Well, Lord Christopher, servant of the king in yellow,

01:48.380 --> 01:51.380
I'm sorry to say that my heart and soul

01:51.380 --> 01:53.660
already belong to another.

01:53.660 --> 01:56.480
They provide warmth when I am clammy.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.960
They provide the densest of creams.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.560
They devour those who would speak ill of them.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.600
And they got a real cool radio show.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.280
It's me, I'm my own god.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.000
Suck it, king in yellow.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.860
It's wolf in Greece for me, baby.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.600
And hey, guess what?

02:15.600 --> 02:17.240
If you want to write up something

02:17.240 --> 02:21.920
for your Tennessean wolf to how, it's real simple.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.160
Just tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.200
It's as easy as that.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.120
Or you can write up a five star review on Apple podcast

02:33.120 --> 02:38.120
and send a screenshot to pretendingpod at gmail.com.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.280
Easy, pleasey.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.880
Or you can tag us on Facebook, I guess, if you have to.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.460
And if you got sloppy wet mitts like me

02:47.460 --> 02:51.300
and you hate trying to type handles on the internet,

02:51.300 --> 02:54.160
release those worries, babies.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.660
I put links to every single succulent smidgen

02:57.660 --> 03:02.000
of our saucy socials in the super secret show notes.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.280
Bet you can't find them.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.720
Bet you can't click on them.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.720
Ahem, Merriam-Webster defines a segue as

03:11.720 --> 03:15.940
a transition made without pause or interruption.

03:15.940 --> 03:19.680
And don't mind if I do because it's time for the news.

03:19.680 --> 03:23.840
Last week here at 694.2 PTBP,

03:23.840 --> 03:28.060
we released our second of two season one wrap up episodes

03:28.060 --> 03:31.240
wherein we finished answering every single question

03:31.240 --> 03:35.840
sent in by you, our lewd and lovely listeners.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.860
But this week is going to be the start

03:37.860 --> 03:40.960
of something new and horrible.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.960
I am pleased to announce the coming of a guest handler.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.520
After all, guests should be taken care of,

03:50.520 --> 03:54.800
especially when they are named David Winters.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.240
And Wolf does not simply introduce a new friend

03:58.240 --> 04:03.240
without also introducing a brand spanking new tune.

04:03.300 --> 04:08.300
So swallow your spit and prepare you for something scary.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.580
This one is Brat Pit with Miss Merri.

04:12.580 --> 04:16.580
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

04:42.580 --> 04:47.580
What's up everybody, it's Zach.

05:00.140 --> 05:03.340
I am here with Pretending To Be People.

05:03.340 --> 05:05.820
We are starting a new one shot.

05:05.820 --> 05:10.200
We are playing a scenario of a little game

05:10.200 --> 05:15.200
called Delta Green and we are here with a guest handler.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.560
That's right, we are here with a guest handler.

05:17.560 --> 05:22.560
He is the rules lawyer on the Glass Cannon Network's

05:22.560 --> 05:25.760
Androids and Aliens, a Starfinder podcast.

05:25.760 --> 05:30.760
He is the dungeon master of New Game Who Dis,

05:31.120 --> 05:34.940
Dungeon Crawl Classics on the Glass Cannon Network.

05:34.940 --> 05:39.940
He is David Winters.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.080
Hello, David.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.200
Hello, hello, thank you for having me.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.180
Thanks for coming on, man.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.760
We're really looking forward to having you here.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.060
We are really excited because for the first time

05:49.060 --> 05:51.720
in our podcast history, we will be playing Delta Green.

05:51.720 --> 05:52.560
Yeah.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.960
Oh, funny how that happens, finally.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.040
We're gonna see if we like it.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.600
Yeah, we thought we'd try it out.

06:00.600 --> 06:05.120
So it's up to you to convince us to enjoy this game.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.480
That's not too much on your shoulders there, is it David?

06:08.480 --> 06:10.960
No, not at all, but like I said pre-show,

06:10.960 --> 06:13.140
I don't plan on there being much rules lawyering

06:13.140 --> 06:15.080
from my direction at least

06:15.080 --> 06:17.100
because I don't know the rules either.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.220
So we're all just gonna.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.540
Perfect.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.160
Well, I think we're just gonna make this up as we go.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.960
To at least one or two episodes of our show before this.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.480
So you know what you're walking into.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.280
More than one or two episodes.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.520
I've made it kind of past the point of no return

06:30.520 --> 06:31.360
on your show.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.680
And in fact, your show is actually the only actual play show

06:35.680 --> 06:38.140
outside of the GCN shows that I listened to.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.300
Hell yeah, dude.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.540
Yeah, this was a great connection.

06:42.540 --> 06:43.920
And so when you pinged me and you're like,

06:43.920 --> 06:45.020
hey, we should do this.

06:45.020 --> 06:45.980
I was like, hell yeah.

06:45.980 --> 06:48.080
Cause for the most part, when people ping me,

06:48.080 --> 06:49.380
I say, hell no.

06:50.420 --> 06:53.220
Very, very happy to be here.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.040
We're glad you're here.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.300
Yeah, this is exciting.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.780
For those of you who are listening,

06:56.780 --> 06:58.460
who don't know who we are,

06:58.460 --> 07:01.500
if you came for David Winters,

07:02.500 --> 07:03.700
we're just gonna let that one slide.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.580
Okay, and then you don't know who we are.

07:06.580 --> 07:07.940
And I'm Zach.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.100
I am the normal handler of pretending to be people.

07:12.100 --> 07:16.420
And I am here with three of my best friends

07:16.420 --> 07:18.020
in the whole world,

07:18.020 --> 07:21.940
who I get to spend time with role-playing, yay.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.860
I'm Joe.

07:22.860 --> 07:23.700
There it is.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.040
Yeah, I'm Luke.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.720
I'm like the serious one.

07:26.720 --> 07:27.780
Yup.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.040
The rules kind of pushing everybody through.

07:30.040 --> 07:30.880
Yeah.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.700
Good things.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.540
Get that plot moving.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.380
Flowing, you know.

07:33.380 --> 07:34.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:34.220 --> 07:35.040
I'm Thomas, I'm the dumb one.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.160
We've all found our niche.

07:39.160 --> 07:42.120
David, do you wanna tell us what scenario we're playing?

07:42.120 --> 07:42.960
No.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.780
Okay, sounds good.

07:43.780 --> 07:46.280
And so we're playing a Delta Green scenario

07:48.360 --> 07:51.400
that you'll find out what it is later.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.920
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.380
But you guys can't go researching this in between shows.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.220
Research?

07:59.220 --> 08:01.080
So that's, yeah, well, sorry.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.560
That's really only a risk for like,

08:03.560 --> 08:05.640
yeah, one of us, maybe.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.400
Reading?

08:08.400 --> 08:09.220
That's fair.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.480
That's a very, very fair point.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.400
I guess maybe I'm giving a little bit too much credit.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.800
But Zach and I actually went through several iterations

08:16.800 --> 08:19.240
of possible scenarios until we finally found one

08:19.240 --> 08:22.680
that he was not familiar with in at least some capacity.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.840
And at least according to him, the rest of you all,

08:25.840 --> 08:27.680
you know, you said you can just run whatever.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.920
They don't really research.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.140
If Zach doesn't know it, there is no way that I know it.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.080
Exactly.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.360
He was very demeaning when it came to

08:36.360 --> 08:38.160
describing your level of familiarity

08:38.160 --> 08:39.200
with Delta Green scenarios.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.560
But that's neither here nor there.

08:40.560 --> 08:42.680
Speaking truth with love.

08:42.680 --> 08:47.560
Well, I mean, you dove so into Delta Green

08:47.560 --> 08:50.280
when we first started, you read all these scenarios

08:50.280 --> 08:52.300
and you're like, I'm not gonna run any of them.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.060
I'm immediately gonna start writing my own cool shit.

08:55.060 --> 08:58.000
And so you ran us through that at home for a couple of years

08:58.000 --> 08:59.720
and then we started recording that.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.400
But yeah, basically we never wanted to spoil the surprise.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.280
Which was rad.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.880
We're all in it for the surprise, yeah.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.200
Yeah, totally.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.620
And you wrote a great 40 episode story.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.160
I did, I wrote a great 40 episode story for season one.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.240
113 episodes.

09:20.820 --> 09:23.600
And so if you haven't checked this out, you can go back.

09:23.600 --> 09:28.600
We have 113 episode long season one

09:28.660 --> 09:30.760
that tells one continuous story

09:30.760 --> 09:33.160
of a small town called Contention.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.360
And then we also have one other short little game,

09:37.360 --> 09:39.280
a little bonus in which we play

09:39.280 --> 09:42.120
Call of Cthulhu's Bleak Prospect.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.280
And we actually had the author run that game for us.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.680
So Scott Dorward, the guy who wrote Bleak Prospect

09:48.680 --> 09:50.700
came on and ran us through Bleak Prospect,

09:50.700 --> 09:52.240
which was an excellent time,

09:52.240 --> 09:54.280
which also tied into Glass Cannon

09:54.280 --> 09:58.120
cause they ended up running Bleak Prospect as well

09:58.520 --> 09:59.360
on new game Houdis.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.240
So it was really fun hearing another group

10:01.240 --> 10:04.960
play through a scenario in a completely different way.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.360
They played it way different than we played it.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.420
Oh, did Scott run you through that one?

10:11.420 --> 10:14.520
Oh, no, they had their DM, their GM, Troy.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.360
I'm totally kidding.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.440
Oh.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.360
I'm being caddies.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
Oh, oh, oh.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.420
Well, speaking of Call of Cthulhu though,

10:27.580 --> 10:29.220
getting back to your original question,

10:29.220 --> 10:30.460
what we're gonna be running through

10:30.460 --> 10:32.900
is actually from the original source book

10:32.900 --> 10:35.060
that came out in the mid nineties

10:35.060 --> 10:37.460
before Delta Green was even a system.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.620
You know, the original source book

10:38.620 --> 10:41.260
to basically modernize Call of Cthulhu.

10:41.260 --> 10:43.780
And this came out in the mid nineties, I think.

10:43.780 --> 10:46.020
So this scenario actually takes place even before that.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.060
We're in like the early nineties

10:48.060 --> 10:50.060
and the scenario is called Convergence

10:50.060 --> 10:53.260
and it takes place in a little town in Tennessee.

10:53.260 --> 10:55.060
But the great thing about this though.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.660
Shit, we actually all read that one.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.060
Yeah, we're very familiar with this.

10:58.060 --> 11:00.180
Oh, fuck dude.

11:00.180 --> 11:01.580
Oh, shit.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.340
Oops.

11:03.340 --> 11:04.160
Convergence, contention.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.340
It's basically a one-to-one rip off.

11:06.340 --> 11:09.740
I'm a tenofile, so anything related to the state.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.540
This is part of being professionals though,

11:12.540 --> 11:16.720
is really just walling that off and playing it fresh.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.540
And I know you're capable of it,

11:19.540 --> 11:21.260
but no, I was gonna say,

11:21.260 --> 11:24.060
Shane Ivey actually was really generous in this case

11:24.060 --> 11:25.940
because they just ran their Kickstarter

11:25.940 --> 11:29.120
for the next dozen Delta Green books that are coming out.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.740
This is being reprinted in one of those early books.

11:31.740 --> 11:33.180
This is one of the lowest stretch goals.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.140
It was like their $70,000 stretch goal.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.320
And he was nice enough to send over the draft

11:37.320 --> 11:39.860
of the new version of it this week.

11:39.860 --> 11:40.700
Cool.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.520
Very cool.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.540
You hear that listeners?

11:42.540 --> 11:44.820
Yeah, that's what we're rolling with today.

11:44.820 --> 11:45.660
I dig it.

11:45.660 --> 11:46.480
Shall we?

11:46.480 --> 11:47.320
Let's do it.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.220
I think we shall.

11:48.220 --> 11:49.720
Yeah, we actually have to play a game.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.940
It's just not an hour of banter per episode.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.060
I think that we're all much more comfortable

11:55.060 --> 11:56.860
once we start playing the game.

11:56.860 --> 11:57.700
Yeah.

11:57.700 --> 12:02.700
It works the opposite of a lot of GCN shows

12:02.700 --> 12:04.180
where we don't want to play the game,

12:04.180 --> 12:06.700
do everything we can to actively avoid it.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.020
We're really stressed out just talking to each other

12:09.020 --> 12:11.060
and we're like, can I please be someone else?

12:11.060 --> 12:12.980
Yeah, I want to hide in my character for a while.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.620
Thanks to Christian to be a person.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.120
That's the name of the show.

12:17.120 --> 12:17.960
Nailed it.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.400
I guess let me set the scene then.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.240
Okey-dokey.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.060
Oh, please.

12:21.060 --> 12:23.120
I already told you basically the timeframe.

12:23.120 --> 12:25.060
We're talking the early 1990s.

12:25.060 --> 12:26.120
That's when I was born.

12:26.120 --> 12:26.960
Me too.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.800
In the early 1990s?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.720
Yeah, me and Luke were both born in the early 1990s.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.560
Great.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.560
There'll be all sorts of cultural and technological stuff

12:32.560 --> 12:34.960
that you have absolutely no frame of reference for

12:34.960 --> 12:36.760
for this scenario, which will be fantastic.

12:36.760 --> 12:37.600
Perfect.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.920
Joe and I were born in 89, so we'll be all over it.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.760
Yeah.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.440
We'll flip you guys through this.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.420
Don't worry about it.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.260
We'll follow your lead.

12:45.260 --> 12:48.560
You got a couple of old heads with you, so it'll be fun.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.640
Let's imagine the scene initially.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.360
It is a nondescript office building,

12:53.360 --> 12:55.640
a low rise kind of in the outskirts

12:55.640 --> 12:58.320
of a modestly sized Southern city.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.000
And I already kind of said which state.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.960
We're talking Tennessee.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.260
Zoom in to the building and there's a long conference room,

13:05.260 --> 13:07.720
presumably the largest conference room in the building.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.320
It looks as almost if two walls had been knocked down

13:10.320 --> 13:12.500
and two conference rooms are joined together.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.440
There's a comedically long table

13:14.440 --> 13:15.720
in the middle of this conference room

13:15.720 --> 13:18.520
with about three dozen spinning office chairs.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.560
Those kind of chairs that try to be comfy and soft

13:22.560 --> 13:25.480
are made out of that like shitty fake leather.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.100
And the table is that weird wood

13:28.100 --> 13:30.280
that doesn't quite look like wood.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.920
And the walls, that old fashioned wooden paneling,

13:33.920 --> 13:35.880
the colors match a little bit too much.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.840
It's if anything, a bit unsettling to you.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.600
At one far end of the room, there's a large crest.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.920
It's an FBI logo.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.480
Now the other end of the room

13:44.480 --> 13:46.900
is a pulled down projector screen.

13:46.900 --> 13:50.020
And one of those overhead projectors,

13:50.020 --> 13:51.940
which will be our first technological reference

13:51.940 --> 13:53.380
for those of you who...

13:53.380 --> 13:55.420
So you put a transparency on those

13:55.420 --> 13:58.940
and it shines a light upward and out toward the wall

13:58.940 --> 14:01.220
so you can blow up images and show them to a room.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.620
And this real hot air blows out of it

14:03.620 --> 14:06.580
and it makes this like strange but comforting smell

14:06.580 --> 14:07.820
and you get real sleepy.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.940
I have a memory from when I was like in the womb

14:10.940 --> 14:13.300
of one of those being around me.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.740
My dad was a youth minister when I was growing up

14:15.740 --> 14:18.700
and he would use them to put on song lyrics

14:18.700 --> 14:21.000
for people to sing along for the worship times.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.540
And he would do such parody covers of popular songs

14:24.540 --> 14:27.260
as eight days a week.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.740
Ooh, I need your love, God.

14:29.740 --> 14:30.860
Eight days a week.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.940
Pretty good stuff.

14:33.940 --> 14:34.780
Wow.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.380
Hey, God.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.940
You'll find it's like peeling an onion

14:39.940 --> 14:41.460
with absolutely all of us.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.420
Just a couple of shreks.

14:45.940 --> 14:48.460
And all it took was a reference to an overhead projector

14:48.460 --> 14:49.300
and we got...

14:49.300 --> 14:51.700
And we got completely derailed.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.020
That's fine.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.900
The initial scene setting is over.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.740
No, just kidding.

14:56.740 --> 14:58.060
One last thing about the overhead projector.

14:58.060 --> 15:01.580
If you looked right in the, like the bulb, you were fucked.

15:01.580 --> 15:02.540
Oh yeah.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.380
This is an oversized one

15:04.380 --> 15:06.540
because this is a very large screen it's projecting to.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.840
It's so big that that bulb is still on

15:08.840 --> 15:09.980
from the previous meeting

15:09.980 --> 15:12.400
and you can feel the heat radiating across the room.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.700
It's almost like a space heater.

15:13.700 --> 15:14.820
It's so hot.

15:15.340 --> 15:18.460
It's mid September, middle of the afternoon.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.820
You see beams of light slipping in from the outside

15:20.820 --> 15:24.260
through those slightly ajar hanging kind of floppy curtains

15:24.260 --> 15:26.500
that you open and close with the chain.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.580
It's an old building.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.380
You see little specks of dust in the air

15:29.380 --> 15:32.120
as you just trail off staring at the specks of dust

15:32.120 --> 15:33.740
almost in a trance.

15:33.740 --> 15:35.020
Then suddenly you remember

15:35.020 --> 15:36.660
you're not the only one in this room.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.940
You look around and there's four people

15:38.940 --> 15:42.620
seated around the comedically large conference room table.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.060
And it's the four of you.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.180
Tell me what you see.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.300
Tell me who you are.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.380
This is the opportune time for character introductions.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.900
So let's see.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.900
Who should I cold call on first?

15:53.900 --> 15:55.420
Luke, you're not paying attention.

15:55.420 --> 15:59.260
I saw you looking away from me.

15:59.260 --> 16:01.380
I was looking at my character sheet

16:01.380 --> 16:03.840
hoping that you wouldn't call on me.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.680
Yep, sorry.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.140
I'm calling on you first.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.100
Luke, what do people see in front of them?

16:09.100 --> 16:13.500
Tanner Tan, Daniel Dan Lewd Hyde.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.580
A 38 year old man, kind of thinning hair,

16:19.580 --> 16:24.200
small sunglasses, not quite matrix style,

16:24.200 --> 16:28.180
but like Walmart matrix sunglasses.

16:28.180 --> 16:33.180
He has some like tribal tattoos on his arm.

16:33.740 --> 16:35.360
Doesn't really look like the kind of guy

16:35.360 --> 16:38.340
that would get tattoos, but one arm is just covered in them.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.880
In the early nineties, that's still really cool.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.180
That would be very unique.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.840
Yeah, he's just sitting there kind of looking around

16:48.840 --> 16:51.140
pretty nervous actually.

16:51.140 --> 16:54.820
He has only really been around this just a small amount

16:54.820 --> 16:56.720
and he's not sure what to expect.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.700
Hi.

16:57.700 --> 16:58.540
Joe, you go.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.740
Harlan Nash is sitting there next to you.

17:01.740 --> 17:03.900
He's got curly black hair.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.740
He's got an eye that's kind of has a mind of its own.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.260
It's sort of lazy, but it's also kind of there.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.340
It can look at you,

17:11.340 --> 17:15.580
but it's sometimes just looking past you a little bit.

17:15.580 --> 17:18.160
And he's wearing a black polo

17:18.160 --> 17:22.160
that's tucked into some cargo pants, lots of pockets.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.180
He looks kind of like he was lost in his own world

17:24.180 --> 17:25.300
and he hears you say, hey,

17:25.300 --> 17:28.100
and he kind of turns back to you.

17:29.020 --> 17:31.520
Oh, hello there.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.300
I guess we're gonna be working together.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.140
I guess so.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.220
Who are you?

17:36.220 --> 17:37.060
Go for it Zach.

17:37.060 --> 17:40.100
Tanner turns to a 63 year old woman

17:40.100 --> 17:45.100
who wears every single year in the wrinkles on her face.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.480
She has white hair and it's short cropped.

17:47.480 --> 17:51.240
It's in like a flat top on top of her head,

17:51.240 --> 17:55.860
very shaved close on the sides, very, very flat on top.

17:55.860 --> 17:58.100
She's wearing a sleeveless blouse.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.940
She has tattoos all over her arms

18:00.940 --> 18:05.220
and the tattoos are the chemical compounds

18:05.260 --> 18:07.100
of different substances.

18:07.100 --> 18:11.980
And she also has just like a skull smoking a joint

18:11.980 --> 18:16.340
and there's a coffee pot on her forearm.

18:16.340 --> 18:19.580
And she's just got a bunch of different stuff.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.780
She's got a tattoo on the back of her neck

18:21.780 --> 18:23.300
that just says crystal.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.940
She's a very intense looking person.

18:25.940 --> 18:29.140
She's wearing platform Doc Martens

18:29.140 --> 18:32.540
and that makes her probably like 5'11

18:32.540 --> 18:34.740
in those platform boots there.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.300
She's got a purse that's doubling as a backpack around her.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.020
And as we zoom in on her eyes,

18:41.020 --> 18:43.280
we see that they turn back time

18:43.280 --> 18:45.320
and she's quite a bit younger.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.820
And then we zoom out and we see a team of people

18:49.820 --> 18:51.220
and she's wearing a helmet.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.020
She's got dog tags around her neck.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.700
She has an assault rifle in her hand.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.560
It's got a holographic sight.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.460
It has targeting lasers and sound suppressors.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.280
She has six spare magazines and a chest rig,

19:02.280 --> 19:04.340
a medium pistol and a holster,

19:04.900 --> 19:06.300
two spare magazines and a chest rig,

19:06.300 --> 19:08.740
two frag hand grenades, two smoke grenades,

19:08.740 --> 19:11.460
two flash bang stun grenades, a combat knife,

19:11.460 --> 19:14.360
flexible cuffs around this tactical body armor.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.660
She's wearing a Kevlar helmet and she is ready to go

19:18.660 --> 19:21.260
and you see her as she just screams,

19:21.260 --> 19:24.020
get down, get down, get down!

19:24.020 --> 19:28.240
And then we zoom back out and she's just this old woman

19:28.240 --> 19:32.880
in an extremely clean studio apartment.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.360
And looking around the apartment,

19:35.360 --> 19:38.760
there's a children's drawing that's on the fridge.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.640
There's a playpen that's pushed neatly into the corner

19:41.640 --> 19:45.160
and the toys have all been collected and put away.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.080
And Cindy, Cindy Woodabaga,

19:48.080 --> 19:51.960
sits down on the toilet and takes a shit

19:51.960 --> 19:53.680
and she pulls out her phone

19:53.680 --> 19:58.120
and she Googles her own name, Cindy Woodabaga.

19:58.160 --> 20:03.100
And all of these Google results come up of the trial.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.280
So this is in the future?

20:04.280 --> 20:06.880
Yeah, this is a great way to ensure your character survives

20:06.880 --> 20:09.500
by including a moment where she's shitting

20:09.500 --> 20:14.500
with a smartphone 25 to 30 years after

20:14.600 --> 20:15.840
the setting of our current campaign.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.160
No, she is 63 years old in the room.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.240
So she's reading a newspaper article while she shits.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.760
Oh, right, yeah, she's got a big newspaper

20:24.760 --> 20:27.280
in front of her while she's taking a shit.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.400
Sorry, ah.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.960
And so she's holding this newspaper up

20:31.960 --> 20:35.600
and her eyes narrow as she reads this article

20:35.600 --> 20:39.920
about Cindy Woodabaga and she was on trial for murder.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.240
She was on trial for murdering her husband.

20:43.240 --> 20:48.040
The case was thrown out due to some mishandling of evidence.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.600
And she finishes up, wipes, and puts the newspaper away

20:52.600 --> 20:54.520
and heads off to this meeting.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.640
And some fingers kind of snap in front of her eyes

20:57.640 --> 21:01.440
and her partner, Jodine, DEA.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.400
You're gonna have to excuse my partner, Agent Woodabaga.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.220
Woodabaga.

21:06.220 --> 21:11.220
Sometimes, you know, her eyes, they seem to turn back time.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.880
She gets a little lost in her memories.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.640
I assure you, she's a very effective field agent,

21:16.640 --> 21:17.800
one of the best we have.

21:17.800 --> 21:21.460
I've worked with her for quite a while now.

21:22.340 --> 21:26.620
So, Jodine is dressed a lot like Harlan Nash,

21:26.620 --> 21:30.820
except he's in a white polo with cargo pants.

21:30.820 --> 21:34.600
And he even says, like, I like your polo.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.540
Very professional.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.220
Thank you.

21:38.220 --> 21:42.540
He's 39, but he looks about 45, graying everywhere.

21:42.540 --> 21:45.260
It looks like he's recently lost a lot of hair

21:45.260 --> 21:47.100
in the last seven or eight months.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.140
And he's about 5'5", so you can't really tell

21:50.140 --> 21:51.420
when they're sitting at the table,

21:52.340 --> 21:53.620
but if they sat up, Cindy Woodabaga

21:53.620 --> 21:55.300
would just tower over him.

21:55.300 --> 21:59.300
He says, again, I do wanna apologize for my partner.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.980
Sometimes she just goes, you know.

22:01.980 --> 22:04.620
It's the analytical investigative mind

22:04.620 --> 22:07.560
that makes her such an effective crime fighter.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.460
And you kinda just gotta roll with these unorthodox methods.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.380
What's happening now is that her,

22:13.380 --> 22:15.840
she looked, well, don't look too hard,

22:15.840 --> 22:17.100
but look into her eyes.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.720
Hey, how many of these have you guys been on?

22:21.580 --> 22:23.080
This is my first.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.060
This is my first in an official capacity.

22:27.060 --> 22:30.260
It's, I've been exposed.

22:30.260 --> 22:31.100
Me too.

22:31.900 --> 22:32.900
What's that mean?

22:32.900 --> 22:33.720
Which one?

22:33.720 --> 22:36.820
That one, and it's like some chemical compound.

22:36.820 --> 22:37.740
It's morphine.

22:37.740 --> 22:39.860
That's interesting.

22:39.860 --> 22:44.060
This one is Japanese for perseverance.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.660
If you knew Japanese, you would know

22:45.660 --> 22:48.740
that it's actually a Chinese symbol that says crab.

22:48.780 --> 22:49.620
Yeah.

22:51.460 --> 22:52.920
Which roughly translates.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.140
I wanna play the Cindy scenario, actually.

22:58.140 --> 22:58.980
Is that okay?

22:58.980 --> 23:00.900
Can we go back to the flashback?

23:00.900 --> 23:01.740
Sure.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.820
Are you fully prepped there, Zach?

23:02.820 --> 23:03.660
Oh yeah.

23:03.660 --> 23:04.480
Can you run that?

23:04.480 --> 23:05.320
I can roll up a quick character.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.660
It did sound like he had enough equipment

23:06.660 --> 23:07.820
for the rest of us.

23:09.100 --> 23:12.380
She was on the DEA's FAST team,

23:12.380 --> 23:16.060
which is the Foreign Deployed Advisory Support Team,

23:16.060 --> 23:19.320
which was paramilitary units in far-flung areas

23:19.320 --> 23:22.380
of the world where narcotics are grown and processed.

23:22.380 --> 23:25.020
But that was a long time ago,

23:25.020 --> 23:29.980
and now she is just a desk jockey with Joe Dean here,

23:29.980 --> 23:33.700
but they got pulled into Delta Green about,

23:33.700 --> 23:34.920
what, six months ago?

23:34.920 --> 23:37.080
Yeah, I imagine pretty soon after.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.620
Also, if you're new to us,

23:39.620 --> 23:42.660
can you tell which one, new listeners, is the DM?

23:42.780 --> 23:43.620
Pfft.

23:45.620 --> 23:46.460
It's Luke.

23:47.580 --> 23:48.420
Yep.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.540
All right, so you're all there now.

23:52.540 --> 23:53.460
You're in the room.

23:53.460 --> 23:57.700
You snapped out of your dust-fueled sunlight trance.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.100
This conversation happened.

23:59.100 --> 24:02.060
The two of you that know each other, great.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.680
You've also met the two new folks that are here as well.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.320
Behind your chairs, you all have bags.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.060
You just flew in this morning.

24:09.060 --> 24:12.660
This is the FBI field office in Memphis, Tennessee,

24:12.660 --> 24:17.580
and you were summoned here by an FBI agent, James Derringer.

24:17.580 --> 24:18.960
You checked in.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.100
This is, again, all pre-9-11, right?

24:21.100 --> 24:23.200
So security, pretty lax.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.340
You showed up, you flashed some random ID,

24:25.340 --> 24:26.580
they give you a visitor badge,

24:26.580 --> 24:29.660
and you were just strolling around an FBI field office.

24:29.660 --> 24:31.460
And you went to this room,

24:31.460 --> 24:33.180
but you've been waiting for a while,

24:33.180 --> 24:35.260
and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.

24:35.260 --> 24:37.700
And eventually, what seems like could have been

24:37.700 --> 24:40.180
over an hour of waiting for this guy,

24:40.180 --> 24:44.140
he finally busts into the room in a hurry.

24:44.140 --> 24:47.140
You see this man, relatively tall, lean,

24:47.140 --> 24:49.340
and with very deep set eyes.

24:49.340 --> 24:53.180
And as he walks in, there's just a grimace on his face.

24:53.180 --> 24:57.460
Just this almost persistent, I guess,

24:57.460 --> 24:59.900
resting bitch face kind of thing going on with him.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.580
What's the early 90s turn for resting bitch face?

25:02.580 --> 25:03.620
Yeah, that's the problem.

25:03.620 --> 25:06.180
I mean, we can't refer to pumpkin spice,

25:06.180 --> 25:08.460
he's not sipping a pumpkin spice latte,

25:08.460 --> 25:10.380
wearing Uggs or anything else.

25:10.380 --> 25:11.220
I mean, they're...

25:11.220 --> 25:13.420
He looks like a sour puss.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.020
He looks like a sour puss, and he busts in,

25:15.020 --> 25:17.660
and he's, oh, agents.

25:17.660 --> 25:19.860
Thanks for finally making it.

25:19.860 --> 25:24.820
I've got something that I need to keep off the FBI,

25:24.820 --> 25:26.180
say, radar for a bit.

25:26.180 --> 25:30.340
And I think your unique backgrounds probably can help.

25:30.340 --> 25:32.940
Before I get too much into it, let me just show you.

25:32.940 --> 25:35.980
So he rolls over a TV on a cart,

25:36.620 --> 25:39.340
one of those big CRT, 30-inch TVs

25:39.340 --> 25:42.780
that probably weighs 80 pounds back then,

25:42.780 --> 25:44.780
cart with a strap over the top,

25:44.780 --> 25:47.420
kind of reels that over, there's a VCR.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.140
Agent Dean immediately runs over

25:49.140 --> 25:51.780
to help him plug in cables.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.420
Oh, I always get the yellow video mixed up

25:54.420 --> 25:56.700
with the white audio. Channel three, channel three.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.980
Oh yeah, Cindy looks over at Tanner and is like,

25:59.980 --> 26:02.860
are we gonna watch some Magic School Bus, you think?

26:03.860 --> 26:06.140
I don't think we will be.

26:06.140 --> 26:07.300
Do you think so?

26:07.300 --> 26:12.060
I'll tell you what, this isn't some Magic School Bus.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.100
Hits play.

26:13.100 --> 26:16.260
Security footage starts playing at a gas station,

26:16.260 --> 26:17.100
it looks like.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.940
It's just one of those overhead cameras

26:18.940 --> 26:21.380
kind of angled at the cashier.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.740
And cashier's just there kind of standing,

26:23.740 --> 26:25.580
chilling, organizing some stuff.

26:25.580 --> 26:29.300
And a young man approaches the counter looking agitated.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.260
He says something to the cashier.

26:31.260 --> 26:32.780
The cashier says something back.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.100
You can't hear anything because there's no audio.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.700
This is crappy, low resolution,

26:37.700 --> 26:40.220
constantly looping security footage.

26:40.220 --> 26:42.740
But he says something and then the cashier just stares

26:42.740 --> 26:43.940
at him very blankly,

26:43.940 --> 26:46.460
like not quite understanding what he's saying.

26:46.460 --> 26:50.500
Then you see the young man wind up with his fist,

26:50.500 --> 26:51.740
just like a normal punch,

26:51.740 --> 26:53.540
going to punch this guy in the head.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.700
He makes contact, but you can see from the impact,

26:57.700 --> 26:59.700
the guy's head almost deflates.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.980
His skull instantly shatters.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.300
And as the punch continues to connect,

27:04.300 --> 27:06.420
the head gets knocked cleanly off the body.

27:06.420 --> 27:07.260
Holy shit.

27:09.460 --> 27:13.100
So skull crushed, head pops off,

27:13.100 --> 27:15.660
head hits the back wall, flops down.

27:15.660 --> 27:18.180
The body's kind of there stumbling a bit,

27:18.180 --> 27:21.740
blood squirting out of the stump, if you will,

27:21.740 --> 27:23.460
that is his neck.

27:23.460 --> 27:26.980
And then the body just falls and collapses.

27:26.980 --> 27:31.900
The young man steps back with a look of shock.

27:32.820 --> 27:33.660
And then steps forward,

27:33.660 --> 27:34.980
hits some keys on the cash register,

27:34.980 --> 27:38.340
pulls out all the cash he can, runs off screen.

27:38.340 --> 27:40.060
Then you see him come back into frame,

27:40.060 --> 27:42.420
basically as he's walking out of the gas station

27:42.420 --> 27:44.220
with a bunch of pill bottles.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.940
Money in one hand, pill bottles in his arms,

27:46.940 --> 27:51.580
and then rushes off camera, presumably leaving the scene.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.580
And that's actually gonna give us

27:52.580 --> 27:54.540
our first roll of the evening.

27:54.540 --> 27:58.540
Roll me some sanity for that neck you just saw.

27:58.540 --> 27:59.980
That was intense.

27:59.980 --> 28:01.700
Fail, fail.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.180
Pass, 39 on a 40,

28:03.180 --> 28:04.900
but Jodine still definitely vomits

28:04.900 --> 28:06.420
on the conference room floor.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.140
Harlan fails, that's an 82 on a 50.

28:10.140 --> 28:11.580
All right, if you pass, it's a zero,

28:11.580 --> 28:15.460
but all you failures, one point of sanity damage.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.620
So you see this, the tape ends.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.620
Agent Derringer sees the vomit on the table.

28:21.620 --> 28:23.100
It's like, ah, rookie.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.020
I guess we all gotta start somewhere,

28:25.020 --> 28:27.220
but we got pulled into this.

28:27.220 --> 28:29.420
He held up six gas stations and drugstores

28:29.420 --> 28:30.940
in the last two weeks.

28:30.980 --> 28:33.380
First here in Tennessee, then he crossed state lines,

28:33.380 --> 28:36.620
bringing us into it, into Alabama, then Georgia.

28:36.620 --> 28:39.500
We eventually got him, took some bullets,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.740
but we managed to get him, and we have him here.

28:41.740 --> 28:43.660
He's downstairs and holding.

28:43.660 --> 28:44.620
He's alive.

28:44.620 --> 28:45.940
He's alive.

28:45.940 --> 28:47.780
Took four MP5 bullets.

28:48.620 --> 28:51.700
And that slowed him down just enough for us

28:51.700 --> 28:52.580
to restrain him.

28:52.580 --> 28:53.900
Center mass or?

28:53.900 --> 28:56.140
Yes, four center mass bullets.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.500
We got him.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.380
We got agents downstairs watching him.

28:59.380 --> 29:01.260
Let me warn you, first and foremost,

29:01.260 --> 29:02.540
not everyone here is your friend.

29:02.540 --> 29:04.740
Those agents down there in the room with them,

29:04.740 --> 29:05.900
they're not part of this.

29:05.900 --> 29:07.900
So be careful what you say in front of them.

29:07.900 --> 29:11.740
Two, the reason you're here, this is a drug investigation.

29:11.740 --> 29:15.460
The cover story is this kid went on a crime spree

29:15.460 --> 29:17.540
because something went south with some drug dealers

29:17.540 --> 29:18.780
he was dealing with.

29:18.780 --> 29:22.100
He needed to score meds, some money to pay him back.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.540
I don't think that's the case,

29:23.540 --> 29:27.180
but that's how we can get DEA agents, a marshal,

29:27.180 --> 29:29.180
someone who's good at tracking

29:29.180 --> 29:32.340
and investigating, ATF agent as well.

29:32.340 --> 29:34.580
But the whole point is you're keeping this

29:34.580 --> 29:36.260
off the FBI's radar.

29:36.260 --> 29:37.820
You've got about a week.

29:37.820 --> 29:39.180
Be careful calling me here.

29:39.180 --> 29:41.860
If I have anything for you, I will send you a courier.

29:41.860 --> 29:44.660
I'll send someone out to you with any message,

29:44.660 --> 29:46.420
but we're gonna need a password,

29:46.420 --> 29:48.180
a secret phrase, if you will.

29:48.180 --> 29:49.540
Any suggestions?

29:49.540 --> 29:51.420
Bubble gum tree?

29:51.420 --> 29:52.780
Bubble gum tree it is.

29:52.780 --> 29:54.260
Yeah, that's strange.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.100
ESPN.

29:57.780 --> 29:59.620
I just got that.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.780
I don't miss much college football anymore.

30:02.780 --> 30:04.540
I'll brief you more once we get down there,

30:04.540 --> 30:05.980
if you wanna check this guy out.

30:05.980 --> 30:07.420
Do you have any questions for me now though,

30:07.420 --> 30:09.540
before we go in front of those guards and stuff?

30:09.540 --> 30:10.820
Harlan raises his hand.

30:10.820 --> 30:14.140
Has anybody seen this footage other than you and us?

30:14.140 --> 30:15.340
No.

30:15.340 --> 30:18.100
So the agents downstairs, they don't know about

30:18.100 --> 30:20.220
the strength that this man might possess?

30:20.220 --> 30:22.260
Oh no, they know he's dangerous.

30:22.260 --> 30:23.900
In fact, the three agents downstairs

30:23.900 --> 30:26.740
were part of who apprehended him.

30:27.140 --> 30:30.420
It was basically a roadblock in Georgia

30:30.420 --> 30:31.540
when we finally stopped him.

30:31.540 --> 30:32.780
He had stolen a car.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.860
We managed to spike strip the car down,

30:34.860 --> 30:36.500
got him out of the car.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.140
Several FBI agents plus a state trooper shot at him.

30:40.140 --> 30:41.780
That's when they finally got him.

30:41.780 --> 30:44.460
But before they even got those four bullets into him,

30:44.460 --> 30:48.500
he got to a trooper, grabbed his shotgun

30:48.500 --> 30:51.660
and was able to basically bend it in half.

30:51.660 --> 30:53.820
So these guys have seen his strength.

30:53.820 --> 30:56.700
Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, it is his shotgun.

30:56.700 --> 30:57.620
That's what you're telling me?

30:57.620 --> 30:58.460
Yeah.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.060
They know if he gets out of his restraints,

31:00.060 --> 31:01.100
they're in trouble.

31:01.100 --> 31:01.940
Well, we can see-

31:01.940 --> 31:03.100
Dad orders.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.260
Well, sorry.

31:04.260 --> 31:05.100
It was a little delay.

31:05.100 --> 31:05.940
No, I just missed it.

31:08.020 --> 31:09.780
Could you both sit down for a second?

31:09.780 --> 31:10.620
Yeah, sorry.

31:10.620 --> 31:11.460
You're getting very hyped.

31:11.460 --> 31:14.780
I can't stop fiddling with this cables.

31:14.780 --> 31:16.900
How many heads did he pop off?

31:16.900 --> 31:18.780
It all started with his dad actually.

31:20.020 --> 31:23.100
He went missing, gone from home for about two days.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.660
This was eight days ago.

31:24.660 --> 31:27.900
Boy went missing, showed back up two days later,

31:27.900 --> 31:29.500
no clue where he was.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.260
He was in a lot of pain.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.580
Parents put him to bed.

31:32.580 --> 31:35.820
Couple hours later, his dad heard his crying,

31:35.820 --> 31:38.900
went to check on him, touched him on the shoulder,

31:38.900 --> 31:40.980
asked him if he was okay.

31:40.980 --> 31:44.180
Boy turns around, punches him right through the chest,

31:45.140 --> 31:47.540
blows a hole about a foot wide

31:47.540 --> 31:51.140
right through the center of his chest, dies instantly.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.980
Kid hops up, runs out of the house.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.820
That's when the crime spree started.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.820
How old is the suspect?

31:58.820 --> 31:59.660
18.

31:59.660 --> 32:00.500
What's his name?

32:00.500 --> 32:03.540
His name's Billy Ray Spivey.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.340
Just graduated from high school.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.900
Recently applied for a job at the local Saturn Auto plant

32:08.900 --> 32:11.580
about an hour south of his town.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.740
Child of Rich and Angel Spivey.

32:13.740 --> 32:16.780
Has anybody tested him for drugs?

32:16.780 --> 32:17.620
PZP?

32:17.620 --> 32:18.460
We're running tests.

32:18.460 --> 32:20.900
Who's gonna have access to those blood results?

32:21.500 --> 32:22.340
Just me to start.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.020
Let's probably keep it that way for a minute.

32:24.020 --> 32:24.860
Yeah.

32:24.860 --> 32:28.060
To answer your other question, no drugs.

32:28.060 --> 32:29.460
No drugs in his system.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.020
Outside of the stuff he'd been stealing.

32:31.020 --> 32:34.340
He'd been stealing pain meds at a lot of these pharmacies.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.300
Was he taking them or trying to sell them?

32:36.300 --> 32:37.780
Taking them.

32:37.780 --> 32:38.740
A lot of them.

32:38.740 --> 32:41.260
Did he have a previous criminal record?

32:41.260 --> 32:42.220
No record at all.

32:43.140 --> 32:44.660
No record at all.

32:44.660 --> 32:46.140
That's why it doesn't make much sense.

32:46.140 --> 32:50.300
Town he's from, Groversville, small town, 1200 people.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.020
Itty bitty tiny town.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.460
Not much crime there.

32:53.460 --> 32:56.020
Even this whole drug angle's gonna look kinda weak there.

32:56.020 --> 32:58.220
But it's what we gotta go with a lot better

32:58.220 --> 33:00.820
than people running around with superhuman strength

33:00.820 --> 33:02.400
punching people's heads off.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.700
Generally the public doesn't like that.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.380
Well before I started working with my new partner,

33:06.380 --> 33:09.520
I did a little public relations.

33:09.520 --> 33:13.220
We've got folks pretty well terrified of methamphetamine.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.980
I think we can say this is some kinda strange super myth

33:16.980 --> 33:18.660
my partner and I are investigating.

33:18.660 --> 33:21.780
Especially if the blood results stay between

33:21.780 --> 33:23.340
the three of us.

33:23.340 --> 33:24.860
Well, and these two.

33:24.860 --> 33:26.580
No, we're running all sorts of tests.

33:26.580 --> 33:29.500
I'll show you a bit more when we get down there.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.180
How do you have him restrained?

33:31.180 --> 33:35.760
He is in a chair with dozens of sets of handcuffs,

33:35.760 --> 33:37.480
various chains.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.060
He looks basically like a mummy

33:39.060 --> 33:41.660
wrapped into that chair with metal.

33:41.660 --> 33:44.340
And he's heavily sedated right now.

33:44.340 --> 33:46.060
That boy wakes up fully.

33:46.060 --> 33:48.020
He's even gonna break through all those cuffs.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.300
Well we better get to him quick then.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.740
You wanna check him out?

33:51.740 --> 33:52.940
Let's go look at him.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.280
Y'all bust out of the conference room.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.820
He takes you to an elevator.

33:55.820 --> 33:58.180
You're on like the second or third floor now.

33:58.180 --> 34:01.440
You go down, ground floor, basement,

34:01.440 --> 34:03.860
and then the sub-basement of this building.

34:03.860 --> 34:06.540
That's like the secure, secure part of the building.

34:06.540 --> 34:07.940
That's where 15 years from now,

34:07.940 --> 34:09.140
where all the servers will be

34:09.140 --> 34:11.540
when they actually have real computers and stuff.

34:11.540 --> 34:13.700
Right now that's presumably where they keep all the weapons

34:13.700 --> 34:17.820
and the terrible superhuman strength murderers.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.220
It's a good combo.

34:20.220 --> 34:22.940
He leads you into a room though, heavy steel door.

34:22.940 --> 34:25.420
You walk inside and it's exactly what he described,

34:25.420 --> 34:28.780
which is the chair, guy bolted down into it,

34:28.780 --> 34:30.940
and then three guys with assault rifles

34:30.940 --> 34:32.380
pointed directly at him.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.620
They're body armored up, a SWAT team basically,

34:35.620 --> 34:36.920
trained on this guy.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.420
And he's there, just in his chair, kind of loopy.

34:41.420 --> 34:44.580
Do any of you have medicine over 20?

34:44.580 --> 34:45.420
Nope.

34:45.420 --> 34:46.260
No.

34:46.260 --> 34:47.460
Nope.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.280
Humint over 40.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.120
Yes.

34:51.120 --> 34:51.940
Yep.

34:51.940 --> 34:52.780
Great.

34:52.780 --> 34:53.620
With the Humint over 40,

34:53.620 --> 34:58.500
it is the telltale signs of him being heavily sedated.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.180
Almost half asleep, his eyes are droopy,

35:01.180 --> 35:02.700
a little bloodshot,

35:02.700 --> 35:07.420
and he's just kind of rocking back and forth in the chair.

35:07.420 --> 35:09.500
Poor kid didn't know what he was getting into.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.380
He thought that he learned something new

35:12.380 --> 35:15.700
or just got caught up in it and then killed his own dad.

35:15.700 --> 35:17.100
How could you say poor kid?

35:17.100 --> 35:19.020
He murdered people. Can you fucking imagine?

35:19.020 --> 35:21.260
Yeah, but from his perspective, he doesn't know.

35:21.260 --> 35:22.260
What do you mean he doesn't know?

35:22.260 --> 35:23.380
He did it.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.460
Yeah, but if he was gone, missing for a while,

35:25.460 --> 35:27.260
who knows what kind of state he was in

35:27.260 --> 35:28.460
when he did all that stuff.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.560
He was in three states, actually.

35:32.860 --> 35:33.860
That is correct.

35:34.940 --> 35:35.860
Why'd you do it?

35:39.500 --> 35:44.500
Uh, it hurts, it hurts.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.580
What hurts?

35:46.580 --> 35:47.660
Everything.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.300
I forgot you got shot four times.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.140
That probably doesn't feel too good, does it?

35:51.140 --> 35:52.620
That's not what hurts though, is it?

35:52.620 --> 35:57.620
No, my arms, my legs, everything hurts.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.540
Where were you?

36:02.540 --> 36:04.420
Where were you when you went missing?

36:04.420 --> 36:05.580
I don't know.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.020
You fucking tell me right now, where were you?

36:08.020 --> 36:12.140
She like shakes his face and Joe pulls her off.

36:12.140 --> 36:15.660
I don't know where I was and then I came back

36:15.660 --> 36:20.460
and it just, everything hurts so much and I'm so hungry.

36:20.460 --> 36:22.820
Is that why you were stealing the drugs?

36:22.820 --> 36:23.700
Because you hurt?

36:23.700 --> 36:26.660
Yes, yes, nothing helps.

36:26.660 --> 36:28.620
You know what from?

36:28.620 --> 36:29.460
Are you sick?

36:31.700 --> 36:33.420
I don't know.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.100
I just want the pain to stop.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.780
Harlan's gonna kind of part the crowd

36:36.780 --> 36:38.820
and get real close to his face.

36:38.820 --> 36:43.500
Can you remember the last thing you remember

36:43.500 --> 36:45.260
before you don't remember?

36:48.260 --> 36:49.420
Lights.

36:49.420 --> 36:51.540
What kind of lights, street lights?

36:51.540 --> 36:55.180
I don't, bright, I don't know.

36:55.180 --> 36:56.700
You said you didn't know where you were,

36:56.700 --> 36:58.820
but could you describe where you were?

36:59.900 --> 37:04.900
No, I woke up in my car going to see my girlfriend

37:05.780 --> 37:07.900
and I don't know.

37:07.900 --> 37:09.820
What's your girlfriend's name?

37:09.820 --> 37:12.780
Her name's Jane, Jane Allen.

37:12.780 --> 37:17.260
I miss her, I haven't seen her in over a week now.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.860
Maybe we should get Jane on the phone

37:18.860 --> 37:20.540
and see what she knows.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.460
We actually, we have had Jane on the phone.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.260
She misses you and she wants to talk to you,

37:24.260 --> 37:26.500
but we can't really let that happen unless,

37:26.500 --> 37:29.020
unless you really fully answer all our questions.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.900
I don't know what to answer, I just want the pain to stop.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.300
Okay, well, did anything strange

37:35.300 --> 37:38.180
or out of the ordinary happen in the week

37:38.180 --> 37:40.940
leading up to you disappearing?

37:40.940 --> 37:43.020
I don't think so.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.700
You don't remember anything out of the ordinary?

37:45.700 --> 37:48.020
No, I applied for a job.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.180
At the Saturn plant?

37:49.180 --> 37:53.500
Yeah, the sat, I just wanted to build cars like my daddy.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.100
Where did your daddy build cars?

37:55.100 --> 37:56.420
At the Saturn plant.

37:58.260 --> 38:00.020
Just like your daddy, all right.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.340
Just like my daddy.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.180
So you went there and applied in person?

38:03.180 --> 38:04.020
Yes.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.260
Which is of course the only way to do it right now.

38:06.260 --> 38:08.460
Correct, and where's he now?

38:10.020 --> 38:12.580
Your dad, your father.

38:16.060 --> 38:16.900
What'd you do?

38:17.980 --> 38:19.460
What'd you do to your dad?

38:19.460 --> 38:21.660
Rutabaga, Agent Rutabaga.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.940
Harland's gonna put a hand on Rutabaga.

38:23.940 --> 38:27.900
Hey, that's not necessary.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.420
Hey, sorry, I just thought it would,

38:29.420 --> 38:31.700
maybe they'll just like punch something out of him.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.780
Yeah, but he killed his dad.

38:33.780 --> 38:35.580
I don't feel sorry for this guy.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.620
You don't have to feel sorry.

38:37.620 --> 38:40.420
Sidebar, y'all, quick sidebar.

38:40.420 --> 38:43.140
Have you ever fucking interrogated?

38:43.140 --> 38:45.180
I'd like my colleagues to step into the hallway with me.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.180
I follow.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.380
What was your name?

38:47.380 --> 38:48.740
You can call me Tan.

38:48.740 --> 38:49.580
Tan.

38:49.580 --> 38:50.420
Yeah, Tanner.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.020
Yeah, what was your investigative background?

38:53.220 --> 38:58.220
Well, I'm in the ATF,

38:59.100 --> 38:59.940
so-

38:59.940 --> 39:01.100
Is this your first week?

39:02.380 --> 39:04.260
In this kind of situation,

39:04.260 --> 39:07.340
I ain't never seen punched in the heads off or nothing.

39:07.340 --> 39:11.780
Mostly, you know, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, really.

39:13.540 --> 39:15.220
I'm sure at no time in the near future

39:15.220 --> 39:18.180
will the ATF get involved in anything hairier than that.

39:21.700 --> 39:24.180
I'm taking a trip to Waco later.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.660
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.660
All right, so y'all know about,

39:30.940 --> 39:32.540
yeah, yeah, well, you don't have to say it.

39:32.540 --> 39:34.660
You know about the stuff, right, the spooky stuff?

39:34.660 --> 39:35.620
I'm aware.

39:35.620 --> 39:38.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kind of scary.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.180
Don't you think a kid punching a hole

39:40.180 --> 39:41.660
through his daddy's chest

39:41.660 --> 39:43.620
and then a cashier's head clean off,

39:43.620 --> 39:45.780
is that normal to you or is that spooky?

39:45.780 --> 39:46.940
It is spooky.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.780
Yeah, so we're here to investigate the spooky shit,

39:50.940 --> 39:52.740
figure out why it's happening,

39:52.780 --> 39:54.100
and keep it fucking quiet

39:54.100 --> 39:57.340
from all the people who don't know about the spooky shit.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.740
It doesn't matter if you sympathize with this dude

39:59.740 --> 40:02.340
for punching a hole in his daddy or not.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.580
When you're investigating a perp,

40:03.580 --> 40:07.380
you gotta use advanced psychology

40:07.380 --> 40:09.300
to make him think you're on his side

40:09.300 --> 40:10.460
or sometimes threaten him.

40:10.460 --> 40:13.540
Okay, okay, I'm gonna try a second approach.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.380
Yeah, Rutabaga, you need to calm down.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.260
Rutabaga, and so she takes her bagpipe off.

40:17.260 --> 40:18.860
Is that your speech impediment or your name?

40:18.860 --> 40:21.260
No, my name is W, Rutabaga.

40:22.740 --> 40:23.580
Yeah.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.340
She takes off her backpack,

40:26.340 --> 40:28.140
which is like a purse that she has

40:28.140 --> 40:30.780
a bunch of random stuff in.

40:30.780 --> 40:34.500
She grabs a cardigan out of it and some cheaters.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.740
She throws the cardigan on over her blouse,

40:36.740 --> 40:38.700
covering up all of her tattoos,

40:38.700 --> 40:42.420
and throws on these little gas station glasses

40:42.420 --> 40:44.180
with a long chain on them.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.020
Cheaters?

40:45.020 --> 40:45.840
Yeah, cheaters.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.660
Yeah, like reader glasses.

40:47.660 --> 40:48.500
Just magnified glasses?

40:48.500 --> 40:50.780
Yeah, but they're not like, they're not real glasses,

40:50.780 --> 40:52.320
they're not prescription, they're just cheaters.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.440
She puts on this get up with her reading glasses,

40:56.440 --> 40:59.440
not cheaters, and her cardigan.

40:59.440 --> 41:02.680
She is gonna head back into the room

41:02.680 --> 41:04.620
with a much different demeanor.

41:06.240 --> 41:09.440
Well, hello there, Sonny.

41:09.440 --> 41:13.480
I just wanted to talk to you, Billy Ray, for just a moment.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.360
I hold the others briefly back at the door.

41:15.360 --> 41:18.480
I'm like, as crazy as this seems, I seen it work.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.520
Especially with a sedated boy like this,

41:20.520 --> 41:23.560
he's probably not gonna know it's the same lady.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.560
It's the real magic of this wild card.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.840
Billy Ray.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.440
Grandma?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.320
Yeah, that's right.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.160
Is that you?

41:32.160 --> 41:35.280
That's right, it's good to see you again, boy.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.560
But you're dead.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.700
Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways.

41:42.700 --> 41:47.320
I'm here to help you figure out what happened.

41:47.320 --> 41:48.160
Okay.

41:48.920 --> 41:53.160
So let's close your eyes nice and tight.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.720
And she pinches both of his cheeks lovingly,

41:56.720 --> 41:59.560
just like very soft, in a comfortable way.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.920
This isn't weird.

42:00.920 --> 42:05.920
And she says, now close your eyes and think real hard-like.

42:09.800 --> 42:10.640
Good.

42:12.920 --> 42:13.760
Good.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.160
Good.

42:15.160 --> 42:18.160
And she just wants to get him like in a relaxed state

42:18.160 --> 42:20.760
in order to hopefully just gain

42:20.760 --> 42:23.440
one more pertinent piece of information here.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.120
Sure, I like that.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.160
Give me a persuade roll with that.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.560
Okay.

42:29.560 --> 42:30.900
35 on a 60.

42:30.900 --> 42:31.800
All right, great.

42:33.560 --> 42:38.560
The lights everywhere, they cut me all over my body.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.480
Tiny little cuts everywhere.

42:44.640 --> 42:49.640
My legs, my arms, everywhere where it hurts, cuts.

42:50.340 --> 42:53.280
Does he have any like visible cuts that we can see?

42:53.280 --> 42:56.440
Give me a search roll.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.760
Past 10 on a 50.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.300
Yeah, 42 on a 70.

43:04.660 --> 43:06.480
22 on a 15.

43:06.480 --> 43:07.480
22? Crit success.

43:07.480 --> 43:08.380
Yeah, hell yeah.

43:08.380 --> 43:09.220
Great.

43:09.220 --> 43:13.000
So the whole time that he was talking,

43:13.080 --> 43:15.080
she was like turning back toward them

43:15.080 --> 43:19.800
and slowly like giving them the come here with her hand.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.720
So they all like creep into the room behind her

43:22.720 --> 43:26.440
as he's like talking with his eyes closed.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.120
And you're, yeah, you're just like looking at his wrists

43:31.120 --> 43:32.960
in his ankles and everything.

43:32.960 --> 43:37.320
He's wearing a pair of a jean cut off shorts,

43:37.320 --> 43:38.960
old beat up Chuck Taylors

43:38.960 --> 43:42.680
and a even more beat up Metallica t-shirt.

43:43.600 --> 43:45.120
But yeah, you look closely,

43:45.120 --> 43:47.960
especially Joe Dean with that crit success.

43:47.960 --> 43:50.320
You see the tiniest of incisions.

43:50.320 --> 43:54.840
They look almost like a relatively large needle poke

43:54.840 --> 43:58.240
that has been kind of healed over, almost laser like.

43:58.240 --> 44:02.960
Randomly spaced out all along his arms, all along his legs.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.200
Basically when you look very, very, very closely,

44:05.200 --> 44:07.100
they look almost like hair follicles.

44:07.460 --> 44:08.300
Mm.

44:08.300 --> 44:09.460
But bigger.

44:09.460 --> 44:11.860
Initially they didn't see him on their inspection.

44:11.860 --> 44:14.540
Can we pull back his collar on his shirt

44:14.540 --> 44:17.100
to see if they're on his neck and back?

44:17.100 --> 44:18.420
His pussy and his crack.

44:23.420 --> 44:26.120
Does he have tiny cuts on his pussy, David?

44:27.740 --> 44:28.820
The answer is yes.

44:31.020 --> 44:31.980
Yeah, all over him.

44:31.980 --> 44:35.340
Basically anywhere there's musculature on his body,

44:35.340 --> 44:38.980
there seems to be these random pricks.

44:38.980 --> 44:41.660
They're a little more concentrated in areas of heavy muscle

44:41.660 --> 44:45.420
like around his calves and thighs, biceps,

44:45.420 --> 44:48.500
and then a little less so in other areas like his hands,

44:48.500 --> 44:50.100
but it's all still there.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.120
Harlan is still kind of toward the back of the room

44:52.120 --> 44:55.140
and he wants to grab James Derringer

44:55.140 --> 44:57.260
and just pull him into the hallway real quick.

44:57.260 --> 45:00.300
Has anyone X-rayed this boy?

45:00.300 --> 45:01.780
He looks around to make sure no one's listening

45:01.780 --> 45:03.920
because you still are in the hallway of an FBI building

45:03.960 --> 45:05.800
and wants to make sure no one is around.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.220
It's like, yeah, we're gonna run those tests too.

45:08.220 --> 45:09.920
We took tissue samples though.

45:09.920 --> 45:14.360
We did notice some of these operating sites.

45:14.360 --> 45:15.400
Took tissue samples.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.240
They've already been sent to a lab.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.200
I'll make sure to get the results.

45:19.200 --> 45:22.280
I will send someone with the results once I have them,

45:22.280 --> 45:23.960
but it could be a couple of days.

45:23.960 --> 45:26.440
And when you initially took these samples,

45:26.440 --> 45:30.680
was the rate of healing consistent with an eight day period?

45:30.680 --> 45:33.160
There's something odd about the boy's muscle.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.600
We're not sure what it is,

45:34.600 --> 45:37.520
but as far as we can tell from the tests we've done,

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
his skeleton's been unchanged.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.080
It's only his muscle.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.720
We think the superhuman strength,

45:43.720 --> 45:48.160
if he were to say, try to pick up a car, he probably could,

45:48.160 --> 45:50.680
but then his bones would snap under the weight.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.820
So we think that's the limits of this boy's ability.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.320
That's all we know now though.

45:56.320 --> 45:57.880
We're gonna wait for the tests.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.720
Needless to say, we wanna be in the know

45:59.720 --> 46:01.800
as soon as those results come in.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.800
Of course, you're my eyes and ears on the ground.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.920
Joe Dean steps out in the hallway too.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.120
And I guess we'll say you catch him up quickly on that.

46:09.120 --> 46:14.000
Anyway, he says, is there a friendly doctor in town?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.660
Is there someone you could get into this sub-basement

46:16.660 --> 46:20.880
who could be trusted that could run some more expediated,

46:20.880 --> 46:23.520
perhaps radical tests?

46:23.520 --> 46:26.400
Not gonna be any faster.

46:26.400 --> 46:29.280
I have a friendly doctor on the case though.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.920
I'm not even leaving it to chance

46:30.920 --> 46:32.900
of some Miranda running these tests.

46:32.900 --> 46:34.600
That's part of why it's gonna take a little longer

46:34.600 --> 46:36.360
is I want fewer eyes on this.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.560
Well, how would you feel if we went in there

46:39.560 --> 46:41.680
with some tweezers and a magnifying glass

46:41.680 --> 46:44.160
and just dug around one of those injection sites

46:44.160 --> 46:45.480
and saw what we could see?

46:46.360 --> 46:48.260
See if we couldn't pull anything out?

46:49.960 --> 46:54.340
Boy's dangerous, but if you want to, you can go for it.

46:54.780 --> 46:58.660
I'm still in there rubbing his cheeks.

46:59.940 --> 47:02.460
Tan has wandered out into the hallway too.

47:02.460 --> 47:04.400
Also quickly gets caught up.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.340
Tan, here's the rundown.

47:06.340 --> 47:07.220
Oh, thanks.

47:07.220 --> 47:09.460
Have we given him any painkillers?

47:09.460 --> 47:11.600
Like try to put him at ease.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.420
Is he, he's on him right now?

47:13.420 --> 47:18.300
He's been robbing and popping pain pills this whole way

47:18.300 --> 47:19.140
and they ain't helping him.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.480
Well, I guess it can't hurt too bad

47:20.480 --> 47:21.740
to dig around in there then.

47:21.740 --> 47:24.020
This boy is on enough morphine right now

47:24.620 --> 47:26.220
to kill most people.

47:26.220 --> 47:29.200
I don't know that digging around is necessary.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.060
We've already, they've taken tissue samples.

47:31.060 --> 47:32.100
I assume you would have said

47:32.100 --> 47:34.340
if you found something in those samples, correct?

47:34.340 --> 47:35.580
They've taken tissue samples

47:35.580 --> 47:36.840
and they're gonna get all the results

47:36.840 --> 47:37.980
in a couple of days, right?

47:37.980 --> 47:39.500
But we could just see with our own eyes.

47:39.500 --> 47:42.240
I want to see what's in one of them holes.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.340
I mean, they would have told us

47:43.340 --> 47:45.180
if there was something in a hole, wouldn't they have?

47:45.180 --> 47:46.820
There's only one way to find out.

47:46.820 --> 47:50.780
I assume it takes a complicated series of phone calls

47:50.780 --> 47:53.740
and faxes, perhaps even hand sent letters to.

47:54.300 --> 47:55.700
So what are you gonna do then?

47:55.700 --> 47:58.020
Are you saying the phone calls and hand sent letters

47:58.020 --> 48:01.900
for consent to operate on him in the basement or?

48:01.900 --> 48:03.500
Oh, no, no, no, none of that.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.340
I just meant.

48:04.340 --> 48:05.580
Oh, okay.

48:05.580 --> 48:07.120
Yeah, so Joe's question is

48:07.120 --> 48:08.420
they've already taken a tissue sample.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.220
Did they find anything in those sites?

48:10.220 --> 48:11.140
So we don't know yet.

48:11.140 --> 48:13.360
But we're not gonna know that for a while, right?

48:13.360 --> 48:14.420
It's muscle tissue.

48:14.420 --> 48:18.500
It looks largely similar to normal muscle tissue,

48:18.500 --> 48:21.440
but yeah, you're not gonna know for a couple of days.

48:21.760 --> 48:24.560
Your plan is to use a tweezer or magnifying glass.

48:24.560 --> 48:27.920
I'm just asking how they would have seen as much of that

48:27.920 --> 48:30.480
as you would in this moment, right?

48:30.480 --> 48:32.320
That's a question for him.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.720
Is that information included in that report

48:34.720 --> 48:35.640
that you have so far?

48:35.640 --> 48:38.760
Yes, there's probably nothing more you can learn.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.280
However, if you want to dig around in the wounds

48:42.280 --> 48:47.280
of an incredibly dangerous multi-state killer.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.120
Yeah, it's on the table.

48:48.120 --> 48:49.240
We could go digging.

48:49.240 --> 48:51.060
It's your funeral, as they say.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.920
Maybe there's a gooey duck in there.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.080
That would be an odd place for a gooey duck.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.120
You know, sometimes you get the genius

49:01.120 --> 49:02.320
of the grandma routine,

49:02.320 --> 49:04.360
and sometimes it's just shit like that.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.680
That's why I'm doing great.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.360
It's so random.

49:09.720 --> 49:12.280
I think I've got you up to speed here.

49:12.280 --> 49:14.160
The only other thing you need to know,

49:14.160 --> 49:16.080
he's not the only one that's reported

49:16.080 --> 49:18.360
going missing in Grover'sville.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.440
That's pertinent information.

49:20.520 --> 49:23.440
There's been a series of similar disappearances.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.480
How many is a series?

49:25.480 --> 49:26.960
It's mostly anecdotal,

49:26.960 --> 49:31.160
but we've heard from him in his delirium

49:31.160 --> 49:34.200
about this happening to some of his friends and stuff.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.040
It's strange.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.360
It's a weird town, to be honest.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.920
Small town, 1200 people.

49:39.920 --> 49:44.480
It's the butt end of a lot of UFO conspiracy jokes.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.800
You know, shows up in the tabloids.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.040
Weird place.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.600
And what is the name of that town again?

49:49.600 --> 49:50.440
Grover'sville.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.880
Grover'sville.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.520
The UFO conspiracy stuff,

49:54.520 --> 49:56.920
what does that date back to?

49:56.920 --> 49:59.040
No, it's been going on for years.

49:59.040 --> 50:02.320
You know, it's just random crackpot stories,

50:02.320 --> 50:04.880
moronic ideas.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.360
Place is just the butt end of regional

50:07.360 --> 50:09.240
and even national news headlines.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.120
You like that term butt end.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.240
Butt end.

50:16.560 --> 50:19.120
Did he give any names of people

50:19.560 --> 50:21.360
he knows that got disappeared too?

50:21.360 --> 50:22.440
Nah, I don't know.

50:22.440 --> 50:23.840
He's worried about his girlfriend.

50:23.840 --> 50:27.560
Yeah, do we have Jane Allen's contact information?

50:27.560 --> 50:29.440
Yeah, we can get that for you.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.800
Do you have some sort of portable telephone device

50:31.800 --> 50:35.520
or a telephone that I can call Jane on?

50:35.520 --> 50:36.920
I wish we had the government funding

50:36.920 --> 50:39.320
for those glorious devices.

50:39.320 --> 50:42.040
Well, the DEA car,

50:42.040 --> 50:46.080
we came down in here and it does have a car phone.

50:46.080 --> 50:51.080
Wow, you got one of those new ones.

50:51.240 --> 50:54.720
Well, there was definitely some pork,

50:54.720 --> 50:56.880
some graft in our budget this year.

50:56.880 --> 51:00.000
So yeah, we got some nice new cars.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.240
You don't need to borrow a car from me.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.040
No, we got a cool DEA car.

51:05.040 --> 51:09.320
Yeah, it's got a mounted machine gun on top.

51:09.320 --> 51:10.480
It can fly.

51:10.480 --> 51:14.480
Mostly just the car phone, but it shoots lasers.

51:15.440 --> 51:20.440
Well, I had requisitioned a 1992 white Ford Bronco

51:20.920 --> 51:22.000
if you're interested.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.440
Wow, I bet that baby could really move.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.720
Maybe we can take both.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.640
Yeah, let's take both.

51:30.640 --> 51:33.400
Maybe one could chase the other on the highway and see.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.360
We go there in the DEA car,

51:37.360 --> 51:40.600
but we leave the scene in the Bronco.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.240
Somebody has got a draft.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.680
The DEA car can drive itself.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.920
Right, it's got the car phone

51:49.920 --> 51:52.360
and also it's kit from that driver.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.160
So what do you want to do?

51:58.160 --> 52:02.680
So Cindy Woodabaga is still just like pinching cheeks,

52:02.680 --> 52:06.040
rubbing face of this Billy Ray Spivey.

52:06.040 --> 52:09.080
And after she gets all the pertinent information

52:09.080 --> 52:11.940
that she thinks she's attained from him,

52:11.940 --> 52:16.180
her face quickly changes back to the hardened face

52:16.180 --> 52:17.020
you saw before.

52:17.020 --> 52:21.220
And she gets real close in his ear and she just whispers,

52:21.220 --> 52:23.380
your grandpappy was a.

52:28.500 --> 52:29.340
What the hell?

52:29.340 --> 52:30.860
And she just looks into his eyes.

52:30.860 --> 52:35.180
She's trying to get like any pull on his mental state.

52:35.180 --> 52:36.420
I'd like to look into Zach's eyes

52:36.420 --> 52:37.980
and get a pull on his mental state.

52:37.980 --> 52:38.820
Yeah.

52:44.500 --> 52:45.940
Much like me,

52:45.940 --> 52:47.940
Billy Ray just looks really confused right now.

52:47.940 --> 52:48.780
Yeah, that adds up.

52:48.780 --> 52:51.940
Basically I took the thing in Delta Green Creation

52:51.940 --> 52:53.860
where you have to take a disorder

52:53.860 --> 52:58.140
and hers is that she is just like drawn

52:58.140 --> 53:00.940
to making people as uncomfortable as possible.

53:00.940 --> 53:02.860
Good disorder, very on brand.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.740
Do you guys think that I've done it so far?

53:06.740 --> 53:07.560
Yes.

53:08.040 --> 53:08.880
Okay, cool.

53:11.520 --> 53:13.640
I have a crippling gambling addiction.

53:13.640 --> 53:14.480
Nice.

53:15.480 --> 53:18.620
My character likes gambling, but it's not an addiction.

53:18.620 --> 53:20.640
I just do it all the time and I like it a lot.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.980
Yeah, mine's a problem because I lose.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.800
Well, I think I'm gonna give Jane a call,

53:29.800 --> 53:31.640
see what, or maybe we should just,

53:31.640 --> 53:33.520
does she live in in Grover's Ville?

53:33.520 --> 53:36.360
Maybe we can go just go there and talk to her.

53:36.360 --> 53:40.280
I agree that we should probably make way for Grover's Ville.

53:41.280 --> 53:43.200
Make way for Grover's Ville.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.340
Toot, toot.

53:45.340 --> 53:47.000
You're taking the DEA car

53:47.000 --> 53:48.720
and you're taking the White Ford Bronco?

53:48.720 --> 53:50.080
Right, we'll hop in the Bronco

53:50.080 --> 53:52.640
and then the DEA car will meet us there.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.480
Driving stuff.

53:58.000 --> 53:58.840
Very well.

53:58.840 --> 53:59.660
Let's just keep pushing this bit

53:59.660 --> 54:02.080
until it's a mechanic you can't take away from us.

54:02.760 --> 54:07.760
We send the DEA car ahead of us in all scenes.

54:10.960 --> 54:13.920
Also, the DEA car is a brilliant detective.

54:16.880 --> 54:19.280
I did an adjusted scenario for five PCs,

54:19.280 --> 54:22.200
so I'm gonna have to make some tweaks, but.

54:24.040 --> 54:27.180
Yeah, I'll drive the Bronco down and follow the DEA.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.640
I'll ride with him.

54:28.640 --> 54:29.880
You might ride or drive.

54:30.280 --> 54:33.520
Well, on a scale of one to 100,

54:33.520 --> 54:34.800
how well do you think you drive?

54:34.800 --> 54:38.360
Oh, not any better than anyone normal.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.820
Oh, like about a 50?

54:39.820 --> 54:41.440
Oh, not even there probably.

54:41.440 --> 54:44.280
I don't know, what's standard these days?

54:44.280 --> 54:46.040
Well, the way it seems to me,

54:46.040 --> 54:48.040
a lot of these crazy drivers out here

54:48.040 --> 54:50.440
operate in no more than 20%.

54:50.440 --> 54:54.200
You know, if they didn't specifically

54:54.200 --> 54:56.440
read their driver's manual, so.

54:56.440 --> 54:58.420
Jodine, for seven or eight months now,

54:58.460 --> 55:01.500
I've been saying, you are my ride or drive.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.020
So I'm gonna ride you drive.

55:03.020 --> 55:05.320
You wanna rock, paper, scissors to see who drives

55:05.320 --> 55:08.140
or do I like driving?

55:08.140 --> 55:09.500
If you wanna drive, that's fine.

55:09.500 --> 55:11.780
I've just got the basic training.

55:11.780 --> 55:14.180
Oh yeah, I've been told I'm slightly above average

55:14.180 --> 55:18.020
at driving, only a few tickets here and there.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.980
I'll, I guess, shotgun.

55:19.980 --> 55:20.820
Okay.

55:22.060 --> 55:23.260
Looks around at no one.

55:24.460 --> 55:26.540
It's also worth reflecting upon the point

55:26.540 --> 55:29.460
that if base drive is 20, just statistically,

55:29.460 --> 55:31.580
you're gonna have a lot of fails and a lot of fumbles

55:31.580 --> 55:34.020
on a regular basis, so yeah.

55:34.020 --> 55:36.820
It does explain a lot of things in real life.

55:36.820 --> 55:39.900
When I get in the Bronco, I check in the glove compartment

55:39.900 --> 55:42.820
for some driving gloves and I try to put them on,

55:42.820 --> 55:43.660
but they don't fit.

55:43.660 --> 55:46.740
Instead, you'll find a super advanced car computer.

55:46.740 --> 55:49.100
Oh my, no, he's in the Bronco.

55:49.100 --> 55:49.940
I know.

55:50.100 --> 55:50.940
I know.

55:54.340 --> 55:58.820
The car stereo in the Bronco, it's got pretty good lows,

55:58.820 --> 56:01.260
but how are the highs, man?

56:01.260 --> 56:02.580
How are the highs, man?

56:04.180 --> 56:05.740
How are the?

56:05.740 --> 56:07.220
Yeah, I get it.

56:07.220 --> 56:10.540
Are there any orange juice boxes in this Bronco?

56:10.540 --> 56:13.140
I wish I could get an orange juice box.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.260
I'd love to run away from the scene of the crime

56:15.260 --> 56:17.820
after brutally murdering my wife and this baby.

56:17.820 --> 56:21.380
Or in thaw of us need to calm down so we can keep going.

56:21.380 --> 56:23.660
That was so much better than your highs, man.

56:27.660 --> 56:28.940
I don't get any of this.

56:31.540 --> 56:32.900
I believe that to be true.

56:34.660 --> 56:35.660
I made the glove gym.

56:35.660 --> 56:38.180
Have you not seen The Simpsons?

56:38.180 --> 56:39.020
No, never have.

56:39.020 --> 56:39.860
I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

56:39.860 --> 56:41.580
I was born in 93.

56:41.580 --> 56:44.180
No, Zach and Luke are both 17,

56:44.180 --> 56:47.040
so they don't realize things like smartphones

56:47.120 --> 56:49.240
when they weren't around back then.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.080
Yeah, right.

56:51.920 --> 56:54.080
You mean they talk to people without video

56:54.080 --> 56:55.840
at the same time?

56:55.840 --> 56:57.520
It's like young children today that are like,

56:57.520 --> 56:58.960
why are you putting the phone up to your ear?

56:58.960 --> 57:00.040
That doesn't make any sense.

57:00.040 --> 57:01.280
Why would someone do that?

57:01.280 --> 57:02.120
Are you stupid?

57:02.120 --> 57:03.360
You're going to block the camera.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.280
I don't want to look at you

57:04.280 --> 57:06.360
when I'm talking to you on the phone.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.760
If I'm calling, it's because I have a series of questions

57:11.760 --> 57:13.120
that need to be asked rapidly

57:13.120 --> 57:16.320
and it would take 15 fucking minutes in text.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.520
And you only video call when you need to finish.

57:18.520 --> 57:19.360
Exactly.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.040
So five hours away.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.840
If I need to see your face, you'll do.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.120
So like five hours away,

57:27.120 --> 57:30.240
this is the conversation we're having the whole way there.

57:30.240 --> 57:32.020
We're in separate cars.

57:32.020 --> 57:33.520
It's five hours away.

57:33.520 --> 57:36.760
So Memphis is Southwest in the state.

57:36.760 --> 57:38.560
You're basically driving up through Nashville,

57:38.560 --> 57:42.640
going to kind of the East side of central Tennessee.

57:42.640 --> 57:46.320
Groversville is the county seat of Grover County, Tennessee.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.560
It's largely rural, a little bit of agriculture,

57:49.560 --> 57:53.120
not a heck of a lot because there's only a 1200 person town.

57:53.120 --> 57:54.520
However, there's a lot more here

57:54.520 --> 57:57.800
than there would be otherwise because it is the county seat.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.680
Dealing with assessments, taxes,

57:59.680 --> 58:01.860
the county courthouses here,

58:01.860 --> 58:03.600
but really at the center of town,

58:03.600 --> 58:06.040
it's an intersection of two streets,

58:06.040 --> 58:08.200
one single blinking red light in the middle.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.440
That is the only traffic light even in town.

58:10.440 --> 58:13.240
There's not even a standard red, yellow, and green light.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.760
This town is so small.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.680
So like I said, town hall at the center,

58:16.680 --> 58:20.040
kind of nearby, you have a small combo sheriff station,

58:20.040 --> 58:23.760
part-time ambulance and largely volunteer fire department,

58:23.760 --> 58:25.920
a town library, a post office,

58:25.920 --> 58:29.000
an auto and body shop, and a pair of local banks.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.280
A little further out, more standard stuff.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.680
Grocery store, hardware store, pharmacy,

58:33.680 --> 58:36.800
a family video, pair of churches,

58:36.800 --> 58:40.920
24 hour diner and ice cream shop called the Mega Deuce.

58:40.920 --> 58:42.760
And then further out in town,

58:42.760 --> 58:46.960
you have a pair of unbranded gas stations, a bowling alley,

58:46.960 --> 58:49.240
a Dollar General, an auto zone,

58:49.240 --> 58:51.620
a bar called Murrells County Bunker,

58:51.620 --> 58:54.160
and then the place where you'll be staying,

58:54.160 --> 58:57.320
Murrell's Shut Eye, a 12 room motel.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.680
And someday if they're lucky,

58:58.680 --> 59:00.160
they'll actually get fast food

59:00.160 --> 59:02.760
or a real restaurant in this town.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.880
That's Groversville in a nutshell.

59:04.880 --> 59:06.700
What was the ice cream shop there?

59:07.520 --> 59:08.360
The Mega Deuce.

59:08.360 --> 59:09.740
The Mega Deuce.

59:09.740 --> 59:12.500
I'm lactose intolerant, so that adds up perfectly.

59:13.660 --> 59:14.720
That's their slogan.

59:16.060 --> 59:18.180
One Mega Deuce, one Mega Deuce,

59:18.180 --> 59:19.940
and you'll be making a Mega Deuce.

59:21.700 --> 59:23.020
That's just good marketing.

59:24.460 --> 59:25.940
You trying to take a shit?

59:28.820 --> 59:30.860
Come on down to the shit hole.

59:30.860 --> 59:33.100
You know in town,

59:33.100 --> 59:36.560
you're given the name of the sheriff before you left,

59:37.280 --> 59:41.680
his name is Dan Oakley, as in the sunglasses.

59:41.680 --> 59:44.640
You called ahead and you had booked rooms in advance

59:44.640 --> 59:48.000
at Murrell's Shut Eye, the motel, whenever you needed.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.680
Getting late though on the first day,

59:49.680 --> 59:53.480
this is probably about seven o'clock,

59:53.480 --> 59:55.400
first night getting into town.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.240
Where do you wanna go?

59:56.240 --> 59:58.520
Do we know where Jane lives?

59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.260
You do have her address, you can go check it out for sure.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.360
I'm so deeply sorry, I'm about to piss my pants,

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.000
I've been holding it for like 30 minutes.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.360
Back in like literally 20 seconds.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360
Dude, just piss your pants.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.200
Yeah.

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.040
Yeah, it's better radio though.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.120
Can we just keep talking?

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.760
You're gonna cut all this or?

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.000
Okay, I'm done.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.520
Oh, he did it.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.240
Oh, that's a lot.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.600
Why is it so sticky?

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.000
I say we get all in the same car.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.560
I was gonna say we could call her,

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.320
but I don't, I think maybe if we just drop in,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.600
she's probably not doing anything,

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.360
there's not much to do around here.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.920
There was the possibility that she was missing,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.060
abducted by the burning operating laser lights

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.080
that inflict you with super strength, but endless pain.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.320
Well, hopefully that's not the case.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.080
I hope so too, Tan.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.600
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.720
So do we leave the, we should leave the Bronco

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.320
maybe at the motel?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.160
Merle's Shudai.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:57.980
Merle's Shudai.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.320
I'll hop in the DEA car if we wanna take one.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.680
What kind of car is the DEA car?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.400
It's a nice early 90s sedan.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.440
Yep, I got it.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.640
Hold on, I got the image.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.720
Is it a Lincoln town car?

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.920
It is a 1992 Crown Victoria LX.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.360
Nice. Nice.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.280
She's gorgeous.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.640
Beautiful car. Gorgeous.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.480
Burgundy.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:20.300
Burgundy 1992 generation one Crown Vic,

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.160
and then your 1992 Ford Bronco XLT.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.000
Very lovely.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.040
Yeah, those are your two cars.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.080
All right, you're gonna take the Crown Vic.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.760
You're gonna go to the Allen household.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.920
Jane Allen's house.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.740
You're not calling.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.580
You're driving there, correct?

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.280
Just going, showing up.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.120
Cool.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.800
Do we want to run by the sheriffs first?

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.060
That's probably not a bad idea

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.040
just to be in good graces with the locals.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.000
Be in good graces and also just-

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.280
But should we even announce that we're here?

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.100
Yeah.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.000
I mean, there's definitely an advantage

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.200
to the element of surprise.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.080
I don't know if it's on this high school girl.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.160
She seems like probably just another victim at this point,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.480
unless she's abducting people,

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.380
taking them out to the woods,

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.520
operating on them with supernatural light surgery

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.440
and releasing them as pain monsters.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.120
Well, I think we have our primary suspect,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.640
so let's go find her and kill her.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.240
Yeah, actually, the more I'm talking about this,

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.560
the more I'm talking to myself into it.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.160
We should bust that door down.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.880
I mean, we could do it in character or out of character,

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.820
but I think Harlan's point to visiting Jane

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.680
was because he went missing when he was going to her house.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.120
So if she knew anything about

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.400
what he had been doing that day,

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.920
but also I kind of wanted to know

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.300
where the kids hang out in town.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.140
Yeah, totally.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:34.380
But maybe it's a mispronunciation of her last name,

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.220
Jane Alien.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.040
Ooh.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:36.880
It's right there.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.040
It's up to you guys.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.440
Do you want to do Sheriff first or Jane first?

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.520
Well, let's go talk to Jane

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.560
and then we can swing by the Sheriff's office.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.660
Yeah, we can tell him it was on our way into town.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.240
Jane probably also is closest to this case

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.080
and you're right.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.640
If we need to hide any of the, you know,

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.680
it's not called Delta Green yet, right?

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.520
Or it is?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.340
It is.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.380
But it's a little more underground

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.260
and cell-based and whatnot.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.780
Presumably you all are from a particular cell,

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.600
the two of you?

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.620
Yeah, you told us which cell that would probably be,

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.780
lore-wise.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.980
Does somebody else want to say it out loud first?

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.420
Oh yeah, well, I'm Agent Nan, obviously.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.260
Cindy Woodabaga is Agent Nan.

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.140
Yeah, and I'm her partner, Agent Nephew.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.140
Right, yeah.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.460
So we're in Ncell.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.840
Yeah, Ncell, which isn't a funny word in the early 90s.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.680
Not yet.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.760
It's not a funny word now.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.040
It's a dangerous, poor, random hole.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.880
Yeah.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.000
May as well, like, come up on Delta Green's, like,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.920
keywords to, like, look into.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.080
Yeah.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.280
Or they just skip that one.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.640
There's only 25 cells.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:49.040
It's like skipping the 13th floor on elevators and stuff.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.240
L-M-O, we got them all.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.880
Yeah, could we be T cell for Tennessee

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.060
instead of N cell for Nashville?

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.120
All right, so you drive to Jane Allen's house

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.080
outside of town.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.560
It's a slightly nicer house than many of the others,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.320
about a mile outside of town.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.260
Again, it's a small town,

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.280
so that only takes a couple of minutes.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.040
You roll up to a nicer two-story house,

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.080
well-manicured lawn, couple cars in the driveway.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.200
Definitely looks a lot nicer than a lot of the other houses

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.760
that you've driven by on the way out here.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.240
Nice enough to have a secret alien laboratory

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.080
underneath it?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:25.960
Quite possibly.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.520
Mm.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.360
What do you do?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.280
Good knock.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.480
You tap on your microphone loudly.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.520
You just take, okay, so now say what you want to say?

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.360
Ding dong.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.400
You are an enigma, Agent Dan.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.240
Ah, yes, let's go knock on the door or ring the doorbell.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.920
Why not both?

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.080
Yeah, I'd knock on the door and ring the doorbell.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.420
Okay, several times.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:59.420
A woman comes to the door, an older, middle-aged woman.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.560
Oh, why hello there, who are you?

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:07.000
We're with a federal agency looking into the disappearance

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.800
of Billy Ray Spivey and I believe your daughter,

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.240
Jane Allen, might have been involved

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.480
and we would like to speak to her.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.680
Can she come out and play?

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.800
No, play.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.640
I'm sorry, I-

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.600
No, she can't.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.920
She's not here.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.760
Where is she?

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.320
Well, she's gone, she hasn't been around for a bit.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.840
When was the last time you saw her?

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.680
Ah, dear, about three weeks ago.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.960
What is your name, ma'am?

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.200
My name's Nancy.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.240
Nancy Allen.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.080
Like the author from Springfield, Missouri.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.880
Yes, no, yeah, she's gone, you know.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.800
You've reported this to the sheriff, of course.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.400
Well, why would I need, she's fine.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.520
But you don't know where she is?

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.440
No, she's come back.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.880
Does this happen often?

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.200
She's done this before?

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.040
No, no, my husband, he's always at work.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.560
He's, you know, it's just me here.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.400
I'm just taking care of, I'm just waiting.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.520
And this doesn't seem odd to you

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.280
that she would disappear.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.320
It's not usual for her to do that

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.940
and you're relatively unconcerned about it?

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.940
You can roll human, anyone that wants to.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940
I'll do that also.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:18.900
89.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:19.720
Fail. Fail.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.560
Fuck, I fail also.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.820
Hold on. So I get on a 60.

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.300
39 on a 60.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.460
Oh, nice.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:30.380
Well, Joe Dean, she seems to be telling the truth

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:33.460
and is pretty forthcoming and honest

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.660
and doesn't actually seem to be that concerned at all.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.500
The rest of you can't get a good read.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.420
Has this ever happened before?

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.340
Has she disappeared for any amount of time?

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.860
No, not really.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.780
She's an independent girl. It's fine.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.740
Was she like on her way to a certain place

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.580
or did she say she was going somewhere?

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.540
Any clue of what might've happened?

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.100
It just, you know, it happens sometimes.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.780
People just, they go places and they come back.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.620
It's fine.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:03.260
Have you heard any of her friends going missing too?

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.700
Does she live here?

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:13.540
Has she gone missing for upwards of three weeks before?

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.380
She said no.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.780
For the third time, no.

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:18.860
For the third time, no.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.900
Nancy.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:23.260
I feel like I'm repeating myself.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.020
It's just such a weird story.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.860
Like, I feel like I'm getting something wrong here.

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.100
Why don't you care?

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.580
Yeah, I feel like you should carry more information

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:33.900
about your daughter.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.300
I'm just very easy going.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.140
That's all.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.580
I'm a cool mom.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.420
Oh yeah.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.740
I'm a very cool mom.

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.580
I had a cool mom.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.420
So cool.

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.100
Yeah, I had to really pull myself through.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.180
Well, you know, like I had to get myself to high school

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.300
and then pay for my own college and everything.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.620
Cool mom isn't always so cool at the end of the day.

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.500
You know what I mean?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.820
Just something to think on.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.860
I don't.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.620
I've always wanted to be the cool mom.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.620
Is that some sort of thing they do in like the Northeast?

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:06.100
Are you from up in Pennsylvania maybe

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.580
and you were trying out like the parenting technique,

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.820
some sort of Philadelphia experiment or something?

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:14.500
Oh no, we got wine moms all over the country.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.260
No, I'm born and bred.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.700
Born and bred in Grover'sville.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.060
You were born inbred?

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.900
Expand on that.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.020
Yes.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.740
That was not a slip-up.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.940
I don't think you actually said born inbred.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.100
Oh, you're gonna have to rewind that.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:29.940
Inbred.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:30.780
Rewind that and listen again.

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.620
Ah.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.940
For those of you playing along at home.

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.580
Is Mr. Allen home?

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.700
Is there a Mr. Allen here?

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.340
No, he's just at work.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.180
Where does he work?

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.020
Town hall.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.660
He's one of the aldermen running the town.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.540
Just so busy.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.500
Work, work, work.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.580
What is his name?

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.460
Work, work, work.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.300
Allen.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.120
Allen.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:53.960
Allen.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.980
His last name is in fact Allen.

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.540
It's Bradley Allen.

01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.620
Maybe we ought to go talk to him.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.620
Maybe he cares.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.220
Have you seen him recently or has he been gone

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.140
for an extended period of time at this point?

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:07.180
He's been working.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.020
For how long?

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.020
He's been working real hard.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:09.860
Good.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:12.960
I don't know.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.780
Years.

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.320
Yeah.

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.860
Do you mind if we come in and look around?

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:19.900
Yeah, sure.

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:21.860
Yeah, you seem pretty chill.

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.460
All right, let's go ahead.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:24.900
Can you show us to Jane's room?

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:25.720
Sure.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.180
Maybe she has like some letters

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:28.860
that she's written from her.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.680
Sure.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.980
She is going to walk you all upstairs.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.780
Harlan wants to be clocking pictures as we go.

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.540
Can I get a sense of which one Jane looks like?

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:44.980
Jane is a late teenage year girl,

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:49.100
minor amount of acne, very pale.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.140
One of those people with almost like

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.300
uniformly colored skin tone,

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.980
just like kind of this off-white eggshellish almost color.

01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.800
Oddly, in all the photos,

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.540
she has almost identically the same smile.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.580
She's one of those people that whenever they smile,

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:07.700
it's exact same look every single photo.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.500
I have the exact same photo in all of my pictures.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.860
I look like Zach.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.600
Fucking woof, dude.

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:19.840
Zach, Zach same.

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.620
I liked it.

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.440
Every time.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:24.720
It was good.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.620
It was good.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:28.720
So Cindy sees a picture where Nancy Allen

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.940
is looking particularly good in a family photo.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.780
And she's like,

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:35.160
wow, you're dressed to kill in this one.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:36.880
Thank you.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.000
It means a lot.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.160
Once we get to her room, I...

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.320
Sometimes it works.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.440
Ever done it?

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.040
You're really dressed to kill.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.880
It's funny you say that because I killed someone.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.880
I killed my daughter in this dress, yeah.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.700
Hairs all blown out, yeah.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.460
Is anything missing from her room?

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.500
Any clothes or nothing?

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.340
Yeah, let's do a quick search.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.420
One more question about her.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.420
Does she look like she's been taking care of herself?

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.920
Or has she been wearing these clothes for like three weeks?

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.180
I take care of herself.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:17.100
Houses in pristine condition, cleaned, smells fresh.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.660
Jane Allen's room, bed made, window open.

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.020
It's not sunny anymore cause it's later in the day,

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.680
but it looks like a freshly cleaned kids room.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.720
Do you think she might've went out the window?

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.480
That was my first thought.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.320
Exactly.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.480
I think she might've said goodbye to her mother

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.600
and then just left.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.240
But did she leave out the window?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.320
You want to give me those search roles?

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.160
Yeah.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.160
I got a 33.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.000
Oh, I also succeed.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.360
I succeed also.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.200
Critical success.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.720
With your successes, you see a largely standard kids room.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.240
There's nothing really out of place

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.920
as far as clothes or anything else goes.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.360
Her desk is there.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.200
It's September.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.680
She just started her senior year of high school.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.960
So you see kind of her freshly purchased books

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.080
and other material, but she's been gone for three weeks

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.460
basically since like the start of the semester.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.260
But with that critical success,

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:16.160
you find a business card on that desk on top of the books.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.760
And that business card says Scott Adams,

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:23.200
watch the skies, exclamation point.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.100
And it has an email address.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:30.100
And the email address is watchtheskies at aol.com.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.980
What the hell does this mean?

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.060
["I Can't Get High"]

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:05.060
["I Can't Get High"]

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.060
["I Can't Get High"]

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.060
["I Can't Get High"]

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.980
["I Can't Get High"]

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.980
["I Can't Get High"]

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.980
["I Can't Get High"]

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.980
["I Can't Get High"]
