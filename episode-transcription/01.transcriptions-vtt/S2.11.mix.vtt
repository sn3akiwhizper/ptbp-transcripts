00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Oh, children, children, gather round ye old grease pit, for it is time for Uncle Wolfie to tell you all his special secrets.

00:11.000 --> 00:25.000
But first, remember, Uncle Wolfie is broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP whenever and wherever I am's best radio station.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
Possibly the only one, depending on when and where I reside, dimensionally speaking, of course.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
But no matter the dimension, I always love hearing from y'all on our special segment, Howlin' with Wolf.

00:40.000 --> 00:49.000
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At TD Underscore Beck, who tweeted about the show and tagged At Pretending Pod.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.000
You can do that too if you want, right now, while I read this message even. Go on and do it.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
But also, listen.

01:19.000 --> 01:31.000
Now, what the fuck kind of wild-ass shit is this that you are writin' to me, Touchdown Beck? Some kind of Cold War-ass activation code bullshit?

01:31.000 --> 01:44.000
I am the only one who will be activating anybody today, Touchdown Beck. And they shall know when it is time to rise to the howl of their wolf.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
They answer my call gladly. And then, we feed.

01:51.000 --> 02:03.000
If you want to write up something way better than what TD Underscore Beck just did for Uncle Wolfie to howl, go ahead and tag At Pretending Pod on them social media accounts.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
Except Facebook, where it's pretending to be people.

02:07.000 --> 02:16.000
Go on, now. I dare you to do better than your fellow PTBP fans with an excellent Howlin' with Wolf.

02:16.000 --> 02:27.000
And while y'all are thinkin' up some good stuff, go on and give us that good stuff by writin' up a five-star review on those podcast apps.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
It'll make Uncle Wolfie a happy big boy.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Some people say I got nothin' to lose. I say I got the news.

02:37.000 --> 02:50.000
Last time, the captains of the crew, Sans Dr. Shark, followed Mitch Diggory, now in ceremonial crop-top hooded robe, to a clearing deeper in the island.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
This clearing had more ditches filled with blood, and finally, an innermost circle moat filled with water.

02:57.000 --> 03:07.000
At five points around this circular moat, shallow pools the size of coffins held a sort of collateral for each pirate crew.

03:07.000 --> 03:16.000
Each ship left a mate here in one of these pools in exchange for an orator, who will be chanting on the back of each ship,

03:16.000 --> 03:31.000
while releasing liquid from a special barrel's bunghole as the crews fight to be the first to complete a circle around this island that sits just northeast of Las Antigas Mayores.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.000
And this weird, old money-havin' Diggory family was wearin' black crop-top hoodies.

03:39.000 --> 03:49.000
Some folks can call them crudies. Some call them hop-tops. Personally, I'm a big fan of croupy-toodies.

03:49.000 --> 04:02.000
Takin' us now to Wavy Adler, Mr. Spitz, Alabaster Al, and their orator Mitch Diggory, son of the croupy-tooty laden Diggory family,

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
as they head back to the death of a salesman to race around the island for a job opportunity.

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
It's R slash recruiting hell, and it's R.I. Peter with cruisin'.

04:32.000 --> 04:57.000
ðŸŽµ

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
The guy said he read through Luke's Twitter feed and was like,

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
you'll be right at home. We've got a couple dirtbags working here.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And then I sent him a picture of my face on the Wheatus's guy's face and said,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
I'm just a late 20s dirtbag baby. And then I tweeted it later.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Yeah, it was a good tweet.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Also, yeah, he's also an ordained minister.

05:22.000 --> 05:30.000
I said, I can't believe I haven't seen you there when he sent me his Universal Life Church badge.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Let's talk about what you guys have to do to win this competition, huh?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
You gotta make sure that bunghole keeps on flowin'.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
That's right.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And the orator's words keep on spillin'.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
That's right.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Anything else?

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Noi interruptions.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Noice.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Noiled it.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
And in order to-

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Noiled it.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Noiled it.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
In order to truly noil the whole thing, you have to be the first to complete your circle.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
We noil.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
A complete circle.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, it doesn't have to be a perfect circle. It just has to be a complete circle.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
A perfect circle would be probably too hard of a task for a sailboat.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Boys, I think we're gonna be fighting a lot of fuckin' pirates this-

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
What time of day is it?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Day.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
This day.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
That's very irony.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
We're gonna be fighting a lot of other pirates this day, and I am just glad to know that

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
we've got Dr. Shark here with us as I point to Jimmy.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
And as I say that, I hand him one of- I've taken one of Dr. Shark's legs before they

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
put him in the pod.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
One of his legs?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
He's got two peg legs.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, right.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Wow, the picture in your mind was so funny for a second.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You've been playing too much The Forest.

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
So we see Alabaster Al carrying this wooden peg leg from Dr. Shark as he's got his arm

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
tightly around Jimmy.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.000
And I hand it over to the new Dr. Shark, because I didn't spy a weapon on him.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Nice.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And so now he's legged.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
He's legged?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Well legged.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
And what's Wavy Adler look like as he fucking jaunts like into battle?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Like you're heading out to sea right now.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Now we're on the tendy, heading back to the main ship.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
He's excited because like one of the few- I mean he does a lot on the ship.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
He's kind of the elder statesman of the ship that people kind of look to him for kind of

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
general things there.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
But one of the things that he prides himself on is his navigation skills.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And so running a circle around this island is right up his alley.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
He's got a spring in his step.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
He's like pulling out his spyglass and making sure that it's all in order as he's walking along.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
He's wiping the lens off on his tattered gross jacket, maybe even licking it,

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
making sure that it's all spit-shined up there at the front there.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Awesome.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
And Mr. Spitz?

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
Mr. Spitz is trying to talk to Mitch like out of earshot of his mom,

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
which might not be too difficult over like the waves and shit,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
and the splash of the oars and stuff as we're rowing up to the boat.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
And he's like-

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
No, I think you're a good-looking man.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, I mean, but I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Yeah.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
It's just, Mitch, you're so very special, Mitch.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I appreciate you saying that.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm just a creep. I'm a weirdo, Mitch.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
You guys are my weirdos. We're gonna win.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Mitch, that's not what I was talking about, but I appreciate the compliment.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, no problem. What's up, man?

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Listen, what exactly is the prize? We get a job, right?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
What the hell are we doing here?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, what the hell are we doing here, Mitch?

08:46.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh, yeah, no, it's a job that was gonna earn enough treasure to embarrass the queen.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Enough treasure to embarrass the queen.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
Is that some kind of ironic like catch thing where like she will be embarrassed,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
but we don't actually get any treasure?

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
No, I think that we'll all be splitting like an absolute fuck ton of treasure.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Which queen we're talking about here?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Uh, Elizabeth. No, that's not what I was-

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
No, she's been dead for-

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
God rest her soul!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
The mom says.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Because it's June, that's right. Yes, June.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Right, so Mitch.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Oh, yeah, man.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
What are we doing?

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
What sort of services are we providing to you, though? Like your family?

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
What does the bong hole test prove? And what's with your words?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Roll psychology.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Can I roll to help him?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, you can all roll psychology.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Oh.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Tight, I fail. I only have a 10, but-

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh my god. I only have 10 also, but I rolled a 69.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Excellent.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You just butt in.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't know if he'd- Could Spitz use a praise?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
He only looks at the world through like items of value.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and roll a praise.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Uh, five.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
These people have enough wealth to where you think if they're looking to compound their wealth,

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
they seem to have enough, but then again, the human condition wants more, so.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
They're just like those Hammonds.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
The process of that appraisal is Spitz very creepily sniffing at him.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
And then like-

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
You're getting smells you've never smelled before.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And he rubs the fabric of the-

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh, you're getting feels you never felt before.

10:30.000 --> 10:41.000
And with a 69, Joe Wavy Adler has this feeling right down in his little pilot bullet.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Little pilot Barry.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Little pilot Barry.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Makes your little pirate bird twitch.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Pilot Barry actually won the first- that was the first pirate to win an Oscar.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Pilot Barry?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
My pilot Barry's feeling weird.

10:53.000 --> 11:02.000
You fully believe that Mitch and maybe even the mom believe that there is a treasure to

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
be had after this competition.

11:05.000 --> 11:14.000
However, you get the sense that both of them have a steady, heavy amount of mistrust for

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
the father figure of the family, which is also the father of the family.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
And his name was?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Mr. Diggory.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Wavy was the one that clocked that it was the Diggorys, right?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Yep.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Hey, aren't you guys- what was the name?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Diggory, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I remember you guys.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
You guys used to be from the old days.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
You guys have been gone for a while.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It's not us.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
What?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
It's Mitch Diggory and Doug Diggory.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Doug, it's you.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
You talking to the mom?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Doug is the dad.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Or at least what I said his name is.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
No, his name is definitely Doug.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You're 100% right.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
We've been finding treasure.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Of course.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
We had to make it look like we had disappeared.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
We're finding treasure.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
It takes time and you have to take yourself away from society.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Is that what Doug tells you?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yes.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Doug.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Ah, that was pretty good.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
He appraises that joke.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Noise.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Well, that's good to see her alive and well, I guess.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
You found much treasure, yeah?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
We know where it is.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
We just don't have a crew that can attain it.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
And that's what we're here for.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Now it's all coming together.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
They want to buy the best crew.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
And that's us.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
That's us.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
And I'm looking at-

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Oh, it's our pirate cat.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Meow.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm looking at the quality of the fabric and the smell of the perfumes in our boy Mitch's hair.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
If it's a treasure that would tempt even these richy riches.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Should we cut his hair off?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
I mean, maybe he's like a nice souvenir keepsake, but only if he says so.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
You just talked about how nice his hair smelled and I thought maybe I'd like to keep some.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Mr. Spence gets very jealous.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
Mrs. Knife flies in and just-

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Cut it off.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Al takes his Octo knife out, which is-

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Wait, no, no, no. He doesn't.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
No, the parrot just told me to.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
He says, what a looker.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Yes.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
What a looker. Cut it off.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Should we get that clean?

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
As soon as you say you want a lock of Mitch's hair, Spitz is giving you death eyes.

13:45.000 --> 13:51.000
He's got his Octo knife out and he's just very precisely cutting, like shaving his head.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Mrs. Knife said it.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And like taking all of his hair.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
What?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah, Mrs. Knife.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
We're on a boat with Keith.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
More like worm fingers.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah, it's definitely Mrs. Knife's fault, honestly.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
He wasn't going to do it if he wasn't instructed to, but he heard somebody say-

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Cut it off.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
And so he did.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
So he's shaving his head and as he's doing it, puts a little in his pocket, gives a little

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
bit to Mr. Spitz and hands a little bit over to Waverly as well.

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
Mr. Spitz takes it, but he is like seething in rage and he says, you destroyed something beautiful.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Waverly says-

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Oh, no thanks. I'm full.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Mitch reaches out.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Can I actually have gaps of some of that?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Oh, of course. It's yours after all.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
Mr. Spitz has wet some with his spit and is trying to pat it down on Mitch's hair.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
You know the monks that just shave everything except the very top of their head?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
You mean the opposite?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
No, there's ones that do what you're thinking and then there's ones that do a mirror version of it.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Yeah.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
That's cool.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
And then they do like ponytails sometimes.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
There's top knot monks.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
But I'm imagining that just like with spit.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Top knot monks.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
He's a top knot monk now.

15:13.000 --> 15:20.000
And he says, do you guys have any mirrors on the death of a salesman?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Look around you.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
The whole thing's a mirror.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
So no.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Then I don't know what the fuck that means.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Al looks down into the ocean and sees his reflection in the ocean and points to it.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
He sees himself with no hair.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
He freaks the fuck out.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
He's like, Oh God.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Oh, okay.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
All right.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
I guess I'll take a negative 20 for the rest of the day.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Oh fuck.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
That's right boy.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
You're not beautiful no more.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I guess I belong here now.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
There's no mirrors aboard.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Don't worry.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Oh good.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
We don't much like contemplating our parents.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
Before we get on the death of a salesman, I think we're about to fight for our lives.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
So I think some more paint is going to be apt at this point.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.500
And he kind of wets his hands in the ocean, sticks his hands into his pockets, which have

16:09.500 --> 16:10.500
gunpowder in them.

16:10.500 --> 16:17.000
And he with like wet gunpowder on his hands, like puts it onto the now bald Mitch for some

16:17.000 --> 16:22.500
like crazy looking war paint that successfully like adheres two or three blonde Charlie Brown

16:22.500 --> 16:32.500
strands sticking up and some tears like flow down through the war paint gunpowder war paint.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
It's actually fucking rad.

16:34.500 --> 16:39.500
So for Mitch, he has gunpowder war paint with just like hands on like the side of his head,

16:39.500 --> 16:41.500
on his face and head.

16:41.500 --> 16:46.500
For me, I do the same and just kind of do underneath the eyes, like football style.

16:46.500 --> 16:52.000
Do you break one of your like massive boils on your face when you know the gunpowder rubs

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
into it and, but this is something Dr Shark has told them to do multiple times is rub

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
the gunpowder into his open wounds.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
Um, I don't know if it helps or not, but Dr Shark definitely told you to and then, and

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
then he, he puts his hands back down.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.000
He didn't, it was like a 20 style insult, rub gunpowder and you open wounds.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
It was like, okay, thanks doc walks around totally gone.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Uh, and so then I like reapply the wet gunpowder and look at you guys.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I'm like seeing if kind of gauge in if you want any or not.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh no, thanks.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm full.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
Um, Spitz is no longer angry and he's just like pouting and sad and he's like, I wanted

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
to do Mitch's war paint.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
Uh, I hear, I hear you do that and I wash my, my hands off in the ocean.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
Get them wet and I open up my pocket full of gunpowder so that you can get your hands

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
wet and do more war paint to yourself and to, to Mitch.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It's not the same.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
And he said, all right, you guys go up on the ship and I'm going to take this Tindy

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
off to the other one.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
The, uh, big dreadnought pirate.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Uh, what was his name?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Neckbeard.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
So yeah, Mr Spitz kind of like looks at wavy and owl, uh, and they nodded each other and

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
they're like, well CS, it seems like you think you might be in charge of that, but over there,

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
but we're more of a pirate democracy and we've elected some captains of our own for

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
your ship.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Meet Mrs. Knife and a parrot swoops in.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah.

18:25.000 --> 18:32.000
And bows and a self congratulatory says, what a looker.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
And then, uh, a Emperor Tamarin monkey with full mustache comes flinging across like the

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
side of the ship and lands directly in the Tindy.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
And then the pirate lands on the monkey's shoulder.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
The pirate?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
That's what I said.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
The pirate.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
That was a horrible accent.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Mrs North is as much pirate as any of us.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Exactly.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
She's a pirate parrot.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
Jesus Christ, the Emperor Tamarin monkey full mustache comes swooping in into the Tindy

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
and then the parrot lands on his shoulder.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Moving on.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
And with that, the mother diggery begins rowing off to the ship that is nearby in the distance.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
Waverly kind of mutters to himself, 50 years on a ship and a parrot and a goddamn monkey

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
make captain for ideas.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
It's just not supposed to party, Joe.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
We're on the boat right now, right?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Would you like to play the monkey?

19:39.000 --> 19:46.000
I was going to say, well, if Jesus, if, if Jesus Christ is off to, uh, off to, uh, yeah,

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
the new images of Jesus Christ and Mrs. Knife, they're, they're gonna run the other boat,

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
right?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Yeah.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Yeah.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Are we on the boat currently right now?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm going to go up here real quick and then we'll basically start with you guys like on

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
the boat.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Okay.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Description going.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Well, I, because I so heavily invested into the animal handling thing, I'm going to call

20:05.000 --> 20:13.000
my other monkey up to, I mean, I think you could also just play the monkey that's on

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
the ship and if you haven't, so like what if it knows semaphore and you can signal to

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
it and shit.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
That's pretty good.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Yes.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
You don't string the flags up.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's literally doing fucking hand semaphore.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Yeah.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
The other monkey can help me do that.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
They do it to each other.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.500
I tried to teach them the actual way to do it and they couldn't learn it, but they have

20:37.500 --> 20:41.000
their own kind of, yeah.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm like, he's telling them the right thing.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
It's going to be so great when they betray us, but also, okay, I'm trying to think, I've

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
been running through my head.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Like what?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.600
Jesus Christ is monkey number one.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.200
What's the name of the other monkey?

20:54.200 --> 20:55.200
Mary Magdalene.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.040
See, I was thinking biblical, but I thought it would be funnier.

20:58.040 --> 21:02.160
Maybe just to go, Larry, this is me monkeys.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.160
Jesus Christ and shit monkey.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.160
What's opposite of Jesus Christ?

21:06.160 --> 21:08.160
Little devil.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.160
Santa.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.160
Dude, Jesus Christ and Santa Claus.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.160
Are not opposites.

21:14.160 --> 21:23.160
Well, but they're funny names for monkeys.

21:23.160 --> 21:29.160
As Mrs. Diggory is rolling away, Edward spits, like leans over the railing and shouts, and

21:29.160 --> 21:38.160
remember Mrs. Diggory, we've got your boy.

21:38.160 --> 21:44.160
And you can see in the distance on this boat, even in the beautiful, beautiful sunlight

21:44.160 --> 21:53.160
and daytime that it is out currently, clear blue water below this whole 10D sky above,

21:53.160 --> 21:55.160
Mrs. Diggory shivers.

21:56.160 --> 22:01.160
I really fucking want some chicken dinners.

22:01.160 --> 22:05.160
Do you guys hit the deck of the death of a salesman?

22:05.160 --> 22:12.160
I want you to tell me a little bit more about your ship and how it fares in battle.

22:12.160 --> 22:16.160
It's got wings and it flies in the air.

22:16.160 --> 22:23.160
Hey, I'd be not shit, but beast.

22:23.160 --> 22:29.160
As soon as Al gets on deck, he wants to go back down kind of into his like little domain.

22:29.160 --> 22:35.160
So he walks into the door on the ship and goes down into kind of the underbelly of the ship.

22:35.160 --> 22:43.160
He's probably got like the front quarter of the ship underneath is his like little living area slash like laboratory.

22:43.160 --> 22:49.160
And there's like gunpowder and different like, you know, kind of chemically looking stuff in there.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.160
Doohickeys and gadgets.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.160
Doohickeys, gadgets, all sorts of stuff.

22:52.160 --> 22:57.160
Mostly it all looks like it's about to like a lighter goes off and the whole thing explodes.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
I love that.

23:01.160 --> 23:05.160
But he walks in and he's got, you know, his like meticulously made bed and everything.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.160
And then he goes over into the corner and there's a cage.

23:08.160 --> 23:13.160
One cage is empty and one cage has Emperor Tamarin monkey in it.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.160
A clone?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.160
No.

23:15.160 --> 23:21.160
Well, you can see the cages are kind of like on top of each other and the top one says Jesus Christ.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.160
Yeah.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.160
And the other one says crowbar.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.160
Okay. Awesome.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.160
It's because he likes to primate.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.160
And so he gets crowbar out.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.160
He gets crowbar out.

23:38.160 --> 23:51.160
He refills his pockets with gunpowder and he just kind of sits on the bed, takes a few deep breaths, kind of like gathers himself and then heads back up to the top.

23:51.160 --> 23:55.160
Even though it's a pun name, I'm still imagining crowbar as way harder.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.160
Like little monkey tattoos.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.160
Got a monkey weight set in his little monkey cage.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.160
Jesus Christ is live.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.160
Crowbar is jacked.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.160
Crowbar is, he's like four times as heavy.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.160
So like when he's on my shoulder, it's like weighs me down.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.160
He's like 50 pounds.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.160
He's bit everyone on board.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.160
It's like a ferocious toddler.

24:25.160 --> 24:30.160
As you, as you bring him back up on, as you bring, yeah, they can rip your face off.

24:30.160 --> 24:35.160
As you bring him back up the deck, like every single person on your crew is freaking out.

24:35.160 --> 24:40.160
They're like, they never know if it's going to be a Jesus Christ day or a crowbar day.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.160
Whispers, whispers, thread, like up the decks.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.160
It's crowbar. Crowbar's coming.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.160
There's a reason that there's a lock on crowbars cage and not on Jesus's cage.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.160
The stone had been rolled away.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.160
Until Jesus went off to captain another ship.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.160
This is why we trusted Jesus to do it.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.160
Jesus was a great monkey.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.160
Jesus was a great monkey. He is a great monkey.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.160
Crowbar's a great pirate.

25:05.160 --> 25:08.160
I come back up onto the deck and I see Waverly.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.160
Waverly's getting prepared for what we're doing.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.160
So he's up there making sure that all the crew men are getting to their stations.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.160
He's probably calling out. I don't know ship call outs.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.160
Oh, just do one.

25:19.160 --> 25:23.160
To sails. All hands to sails.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.160
Awesome.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.160
He's starting to scout where the starting line is with his spyglass.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.160
And he's moving the steering wheel to try and get the rudder in place

25:30.160 --> 25:33.160
to get us a good angle to make sure that when we get to the starting line

25:33.160 --> 25:37.160
we've got a good starting shot to roll out on.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.160
That sounds good. So we've got four ships total.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.160
You're in control of two of them.

25:42.160 --> 25:49.160
And then we have the ship known as the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.160
Nice work.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.160
The powdered wig flag.

25:54.160 --> 25:59.160
The cannon on the flag is wearing a powdered wig.

25:59.160 --> 26:04.160
They are lined up very inside track on this race.

26:04.160 --> 26:10.160
And then the port deserters, which is the Union Jack flag

26:10.160 --> 26:14.160
with a bottle embroidered over the top of it.

26:14.160 --> 26:18.160
The port deserters are much further away from the island.

26:18.160 --> 26:22.160
They are betting on the speed of their ship.

26:22.160 --> 26:28.160
And you know these ex-military guys have an incredibly fast ship.

26:28.160 --> 26:32.160
So they're taking the outside track to try to avoid combat.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.160
Finally, the Swingsing brothers.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.160
Everything I said earlier was wrong.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.160
There are actually five ships total.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.160
That would make more sense for sure.

26:41.160 --> 26:46.160
The other one is the music notes that are flinging themselves off of a ship on their flag.

26:46.160 --> 26:50.160
They are known as the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam.

26:50.160 --> 26:56.160
And they are also lined up pretty close to the island.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.160
Sort of close to the fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.

26:59.160 --> 27:02.160
And so from inner to outer, what's the...

27:02.160 --> 27:05.160
First would be fancy pyromancy on the dam sea.

27:05.160 --> 27:11.160
Next, pretty close by within range is the Swingsing brothers, Barney and Balaam.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.160
And then there's a lot of space.

27:14.160 --> 27:19.160
Like multiple cannon ranges between them and the port deserters.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.160
And where are we?

27:20.160 --> 27:21.160
Where are you?

27:21.160 --> 27:23.160
Yeah, that's what we're talking about right now.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.160
Oh, okay.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
He just laid out where the other ships are.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.160
So we can decide now where do we want to put ourselves between which two ships.

27:28.160 --> 27:33.160
I'm pretty confident in my ability to run this crews firing squad.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.160
Firing squad? Not really.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.160
I mean...

27:36.160 --> 27:38.160
Offensive line. How about that?

27:39.160 --> 27:44.160
I'll just be back here on the tight end.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.160
Mitch says as he heads to the stern.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.160
I think we start in the middle and we immediately start shooting.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.160
By middle, do you want to be closer to the port deserters?

27:52.160 --> 27:54.160
They're the ones who are kind of far outside now.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.160
I think we should mob the weakest with our superior numbers.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.160
Send them to the bottom of the sea.

28:00.160 --> 28:04.160
I think we let the weak ones take care of each other and we go after the...

28:04.160 --> 28:07.160
We know that those guys are going to be fast, so we take them down fast.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.160
We don't know who's going to be fast, do we?

28:10.160 --> 28:14.160
When I was describing the port deserters, I described their ship as, you know...

28:14.160 --> 28:16.160
They're ex-military and they're very fast.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.160
We know who's going to be fast, yes.

28:18.160 --> 28:23.160
But I say let the strongest weaken themselves out.

28:23.160 --> 28:27.160
We pick off the weak slim pickings, then we come up on the remainders.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.160
Whoever's left.

28:28.160 --> 28:33.160
Well, I think we let the losers take care of themselves and we fight our number one competition.

28:33.160 --> 28:37.160
We also have the advantage of two ships, so we can have the neckbeard run interference anywhere we want.

28:37.160 --> 28:41.160
That's always the advantage, but we can also mob any one ship.

28:41.160 --> 28:48.160
I have complete and the utmost confidence in the ability of Jesus Christ to sink the weak ships.

28:48.160 --> 28:52.160
I think we take after the Dusty Pirates or whatever they're called.

28:52.160 --> 28:55.160
I imagine they're all quite Dusty Pirates.

28:55.160 --> 29:00.160
I knew it was something to do with music notes, but I forgot what they were called.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.160
The Dusty Pirates?

29:01.160 --> 29:02.160
What are they called?

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
The Swing Sing Brothers?

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
That's what I said.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.160
Yeah, the Dusty Pirates.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.160
What?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.160
What?

29:08.160 --> 29:12.160
I don't know where Dusty came from, but that's what I was referring to, was the Sing Swing Brothers.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.160
But what were you saying about the Swing Swing Brothers?

29:14.160 --> 29:18.160
We should follow them and we should take them, because they're going to be the fastest.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.160
No, it's the port deserters who are the fastest.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.160
That's the deserters.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.160
That's why I said Dusty.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.160
Dusty Pirates.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.160
Hey, I'm just here to shoot shit.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
Right.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
Right.

29:31.160 --> 29:36.160
So why don't you tend to your guns and leave the strategy to Mr. Adler?

29:36.160 --> 29:43.160
He leaves the strategy huddle to make sure that his guys are all ready to shoot on his command.

29:43.160 --> 29:50.160
My vote was to have our sister ship now, the Neckbeards, take out some aggression there

29:50.160 --> 29:51.160
on the port deserters.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.160
They're the ones who are going to get the lead.

29:52.160 --> 29:56.160
We don't want them to get the lead, because if they get the lead, they're going to keep the lead.

29:56.160 --> 30:02.160
And then I think that, as far as we are concerned, maybe put ourselves kind of distant from the other two?

30:02.160 --> 30:07.160
Well, the whole idea is to get there first, to make a circle first, right?

30:07.160 --> 30:09.160
Which the port deserters are going to do if we don't stop them.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.160
That's what I'm saying.

30:11.160 --> 30:18.160
So we take care of them, and then Jesus and Miss Sword are going to take, Miss Knife, whatever the name is,

30:18.160 --> 30:22.160
is going to take care of the ones that aren't our competition.

30:22.160 --> 30:29.160
And then once we take care of the fast boys, we are the fast boys, and we just complete the race.

30:29.160 --> 30:34.160
What of these fancy pants? How do we make of their capabilities?

30:34.160 --> 30:39.160
I want to get out my spyglass and maybe do a spot hidden or an appraisal.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.160
Yeah, I want to help with that.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.160
Yeah, absolutely.

30:41.160 --> 30:47.160
I'd like to spot hidden, but for what their offensive capabilities are.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.160
I pass for sure. Let's see if I get a crit.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.160
I do not.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.160
We got a pass from Wavy Adler.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.160
Pass for Edward Spitz.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.160
I got a 44 and a 45.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.160
Can we just blanket this, the other ships, not just the pyromancy?

30:59.160 --> 31:00.160
Absolutely.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.160
And we got a crit from Al.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
Alabaster.

31:04.160 --> 31:13.160
As you look at the ship Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea, you see that their canons are massive, and they have lots of them.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.160
This thing is weighed down.

31:15.160 --> 31:20.160
It is not going to be particularly fast. That's why they've taken the inside track.

31:20.160 --> 31:26.160
However, their canons fire at an absurdly long range given the length of their barrels.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.160
We should put the neckbeards between them and us.

31:29.160 --> 31:37.160
When you see the Port Deserters ship, you see that they are all just chilling and drinking on deck.

31:37.160 --> 31:45.160
And they are already celebrating their victory with how deeply fast their ship is.

31:45.160 --> 31:53.160
The Swingsing Brothers are already preparing for acrobatics and sword fighting.

31:53.160 --> 31:57.160
They are getting fully in mode to engage.

31:57.160 --> 32:06.160
They seem to be directing their rudder directly at Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea to go directly toward them right at the top.

32:06.160 --> 32:13.160
So we put the neckbeards between the Fancy Damned Sea's guns and our holes.

32:13.160 --> 32:18.160
And we make, like you lot are saying, for the Port Deserters.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.160
The Dusty Pirates?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
No.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.160
Port Deserters.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.160
I'm going to keep calling them that.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.160
You're going to be telling your men to shoot at the wrong things.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.160
The Port Deserters were on the outside?

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
Yeah, and they're the fastest ship.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.160
I really should have brought my whiteboard, that's my bad.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.160
No, this is fine.

32:35.160 --> 32:39.160
Gentlemen, I think both of our ideas have some merit here.

32:39.160 --> 32:42.160
We put the Port Deserters between us and...

32:42.160 --> 32:43.160
Nope, they're on the outside.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.160
Yes, exactly.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
We can be even farther out.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.160
Oh, we can be farther out than them?

32:46.160 --> 32:47.160
We're on their outside.

32:47.160 --> 32:51.160
And then between us and those scary guns, the neckbeards are there too.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.160
Agreed.

32:52.160 --> 32:59.160
Us, Deserters, neckbeards, Swinksing Bros, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.

32:59.160 --> 33:03.160
I think we should take both of our boats after the Port Deserters.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.160
Can we talk about our ship a little bit?

33:04.160 --> 33:08.160
How do we feel about compared to these other boats, our speed?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.160
Let's just say that.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.160
How do we feel compared to these other boats as far as our speed compares to their speeds?

33:13.160 --> 33:16.160
I would say, what's your rope use score?

33:16.160 --> 33:21.160
I gave myself, in Kala Cthulhu, or Pulp Cthulhu, it's drive wagon slash coach.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.160
I just crossed that out and called it ship and said 70.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.160
Oh, okay.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.160
Then we'll use that 70.

33:27.160 --> 33:35.160
So you would consider yourself 10% slower than the fastest ship and 10% faster than

33:35.160 --> 33:40.160
the next slowest, but then quite a bit faster than Fancy Pyromancy on the Damson.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.160
Right, right, right, right.

33:41.160 --> 33:44.160
The reason I brought that up is just to think about that inside track that the fancy is

33:44.160 --> 33:46.160
using, if we wanted to get closer like that.

33:46.160 --> 33:50.160
But with just being 10% behind Port Deserters, yeah, I don't think it matters.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.160
You guys have a fast crew, a fast ship.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.160
Yeah.

33:53.160 --> 33:58.160
Would you call the Fancy Pyromancy, if you had to like rate maybe what like their cannons

33:58.160 --> 33:59.160
and stuff were?

33:59.160 --> 34:02.160
A hundred, the way it sounded.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.160
Yeah, you got it.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.160
Yeah, I think that's a good idea then.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.160
If you want to put us on the outside of the deserters.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
Mob the deserters.

34:08.160 --> 34:12.160
And if it seems like any of the others are, you know, maybe pulling away from their scuff

34:12.160 --> 34:14.160
while we send the neckbeards after them.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.160
Look at it.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.160
Look at it.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.160
Look at the Sling Sling brothers.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.160
Look at their rudder.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.160
That's pointed right at the pyromancers.

34:19.160 --> 34:23.160
They've been pyromancies in some fancy business for a little while.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.160
Exactly.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.160
I think the guys on the inside are going to take care of themselves.

34:26.160 --> 34:30.160
And then they'll at least keep each other busy and we can deal with the deserters.

34:30.160 --> 34:35.160
The smoke signal from the middle of the island changes from black to a white smoke.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.160
Oh fuck.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.160
Go, go, go.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.160
As if a poop has been chosen.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.160
Foesail, catch the wind.

34:40.160 --> 34:46.160
Al runs down into the basement so he can light the pirate light, which helps with all the

34:46.160 --> 34:48.160
lights on the ship.

34:49.160 --> 34:52.160
And gives a boost to Joe's pilot score.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.160
No, the pirate light.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.160
His pirate score, yeah.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.160
I said pirate score.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.160
We all said pirate.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.160
Spitz is kind of doing what he's been doing this whole time, which is just like sending

35:05.160 --> 35:06.160
people to the right place.

35:06.160 --> 35:11.160
But he's also not quite as effective as he might be in this case because even though

35:11.160 --> 35:17.160
our ship does not have a captain, he makes sure no one goes near the captain's cabin.

35:18.160 --> 35:23.160
It's unoccupied but he's like, it won't always be that way.

35:23.160 --> 35:27.160
He just really, his only desire is to serve a hierarchy.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.160
Oh then I should have given you a captain, my bad.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.160
No, that's my character arc.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.160
He's going to find his captain.

35:36.160 --> 35:42.160
Al runs back up from lighting the pirate light and he starts yelling at everybody like,

35:42.160 --> 35:43.160
Man the cannons!

35:43.160 --> 35:45.160
Are we close enough to hit them?

35:45.160 --> 35:46.160
Al!

35:46.160 --> 35:47.160
Alabaster!

35:47.160 --> 35:49.160
Signal to the backbears!

35:49.160 --> 35:51.160
They need to open fire too!

35:51.160 --> 35:52.160
Crowbar!

35:52.160 --> 35:57.160
Crowbar runs up the mast pretty slowly because of the density that he's carrying up there.

35:57.160 --> 36:02.160
It's like watching a giant move where it's like moving a lot but slowly.

36:02.160 --> 36:10.160
And eventually like fucking Yadier Molina trying to steal second this...

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
You mean super duper fast?

36:11.160 --> 36:12.160
That's cool.

36:12.160 --> 36:17.160
This chonker knows exactly how to do what it's doing.

36:17.160 --> 36:22.160
Like Albert Pujols moving into second on Fielder's Indifference.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.160
That's right.

36:23.160 --> 36:31.160
And so the monkey crowbar changes out a green flag for a red flag with a white stripe in it.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.160
Which is the signal to the other ship.

36:34.160 --> 36:40.160
And you see in the distance Jesus Christ throws up the affirming flag on the ship of Neckbeard.

36:40.160 --> 36:46.160
And so I need a sailing roll from Mr. Wavey Adler.

36:46.160 --> 36:51.160
That's a pass with a nine.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
Okay.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.160
Pass with an eight.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.160
Oh!

36:54.160 --> 36:55.160
Fuck yeah!

36:55.160 --> 36:56.160
Slightly better jump.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.160
Damn.

36:57.160 --> 36:58.160
Oh no!

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
We get it.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.160
We get it.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
We're above in the contest.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.160
The port deserters were drinking so our cannon fire startles them.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.160
Oh fuck!

37:04.160 --> 37:08.160
That and then also just yeah like they're over fucking confident.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
They're cocky.

37:09.160 --> 37:13.160
Because I noticed them like drinking on board and kind of spilling all over the place I've

37:13.160 --> 37:20.160
loaded up a couple of the cannons with just like molotov kind of cannon balls to make

37:20.160 --> 37:21.160
fire.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
Should we?

37:22.160 --> 37:26.160
I guess we could even do this now in podcast time or we could cut back but we didn't talk

37:26.160 --> 37:29.160
about how we set up our orator and the barrel in the back.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.160
Oh yeah let's do that.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.160
We'll have to have a little talk with Mitch before.

37:33.160 --> 37:38.160
Mitch takes the barrel and heaves it kind of rolls it over each side as he makes his

37:38.160 --> 37:42.160
way back to the stern of the death of a salesman.

37:42.160 --> 37:48.160
As he hits the stairs going up to that back deck he kind of looks around for anyone's

37:48.160 --> 37:49.160
help.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.160
Oh Mitch Mitch!

37:50.160 --> 37:51.160
Mitch!

37:51.160 --> 37:53.160
It's me Mr. Spitz.

37:53.160 --> 37:56.160
Oh hey Mr. Spitz.

37:56.160 --> 38:00.160
Can you help me carry this barrel back to the stern and get it ready?

38:00.160 --> 38:01.160
Yeah yeah of course.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.160
Anything for you my boy.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.160
Oh man you're so nice to me.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.160
I'm really worried.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.160
Alright.

38:08.160 --> 38:13.160
He begins helping you kind of carry it back there and you guys get it to the back and

38:13.160 --> 38:17.160
kind of get it ready and set up the bunghole to be perfectly.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.160
I've got a Marlin's bike ready to drive into that the second the smoke goes off but he

38:21.160 --> 38:25.160
turns around and he pauses like Mitch why are you worried?

38:25.160 --> 38:36.160
I'm just I think that um it's a lot of like I don't know do you do you believe in magic?

38:36.160 --> 38:37.160
I do.

38:37.160 --> 38:43.160
He like parts his vest to reveal all manner of like superstitious charms like crucifixes

38:43.160 --> 38:48.160
just everything any anything he might imagine would bring him some luck in his pirate life

38:48.160 --> 38:53.160
and he's like of course I do Mitch all pirates believe in magic and he gets a twinkle in

38:53.160 --> 39:00.160
the side.

39:00.160 --> 39:06.160
At that point Al walks out with like a giant length of rope and is like looking around

39:06.160 --> 39:08.160
for something to tie him to.

39:08.160 --> 39:13.160
Were these tattoos on your chest or were they trinkets that you had like a neck on necklaces?

39:13.160 --> 39:20.160
Oh there's there's trinkets there's tattoos there's essential scars nice yeah essential

39:20.160 --> 39:25.160
yeah no he's got some crystals and essential oils dangling down from there he's got a he's

39:25.160 --> 39:29.160
got a Himalaya salt crystal lamp in his wig.

39:29.160 --> 39:33.160
He's got Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial.

39:33.160 --> 39:41.160
I just think that um yeah no that's good that's really that's really good Mr. Spitz.

39:41.160 --> 39:47.160
Hold on one moment Mitch and he collects some crystals that he was charging on the railing.

39:47.160 --> 39:54.160
If all moonlight's not you understand.

39:54.160 --> 40:01.160
He looks back and he's just like I really um yeah no I think that'll be uh I think that'll

40:01.160 --> 40:07.160
be helpful for you you know uh just keeping your keeping your head on your shoulders keep

40:07.160 --> 40:16.160
your marbles you know all right okay um am I gonna fall back am I gonna fall off this

40:16.160 --> 40:17.160
thing back here?

40:17.160 --> 40:19.160
Mitch have you ever been on a boat?

40:19.160 --> 40:20.160
Yeah I got here on a boat.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.160
You know how to stand?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.160
Yeah yeah I've been standing for a while yeah.

40:23.160 --> 40:28.160
Al comes out with some rope and he's like oh could you stand maybe right up against

40:28.160 --> 40:30.160
that pole right next to you?

40:30.160 --> 40:34.160
Wait wait wait no no no give him some length you know we want him to.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.160
We don't want him falling off this boat.

40:36.160 --> 40:39.160
That's why you give him some length you fool.

40:39.160 --> 40:45.160
This pirate balls are about to be throwing that's what we call cannon balls.

40:45.160 --> 40:48.160
Pirate balls, pirate balls gonna be flowing.

40:48.160 --> 40:52.160
We want Mitch to be able to dart from side to side but still.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.160
From side to side.

40:53.160 --> 40:57.160
When Al came out with the rope his intention was to just like completely secure him to

40:57.160 --> 41:05.160
a pole but he's been convinced otherwise so uh he he he ties the rope kind of like like

41:05.160 --> 41:10.160
in a harness around his like arms and gives him about 10 feet of rope but like enough

41:10.160 --> 41:16.160
that if he fell off like only half of his body would be off the ship like he wouldn't

41:16.160 --> 41:18.160
fall very far falling off.

41:18.160 --> 41:22.160
I think now is the perfect time for the smoke to change yeah?

41:22.160 --> 41:23.160
Yeah.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.160
Smoke to go off.

41:24.160 --> 41:27.160
Luke go ahead and roll a heavy what is your skill called?

41:27.160 --> 41:31.160
It's called uh heavy weapons and I got a 48 on an 80.

41:31.160 --> 41:35.160
Hey that'll do it okay cool uh go ahead and roll a d8.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.160
Luke just signaled uh four fingers to Zach.

41:43.160 --> 41:47.160
And Zach moved his head toward Luke's microphone.

41:48.160 --> 41:58.160
Alright cool so um Thomas as the ship lurches forward the sails are filled.

41:58.160 --> 42:05.160
Every single one of these massive pieces of cloth is taut in the in the heavy wind of

42:05.160 --> 42:11.160
this summer day and it just pushes you forward and it's almost as if you like.

42:11.160 --> 42:15.160
It's like the wind's blowing so hard that it's like crazy.

42:16.160 --> 42:21.160
The ship lurches forward and in that moment as we begin you know what you must do.

42:21.160 --> 42:26.160
Yeah Edward Spitz takes a very practiced hand to his mallet you know in the marlots bike

42:26.160 --> 42:32.160
and busts open the bunghole and lets that liquid spray out the back.

42:32.160 --> 42:37.160
And immediately the smell of iron hits your nose as blood begins pouring out the back

42:37.160 --> 42:46.160
of the ship and your cannons go firing off and you see the port deserters head off to

42:46.160 --> 42:48.160
a start just about even with you.

42:48.160 --> 42:53.160
You're dead neck and neck and your cannons are firing through the whole of their ship

42:53.160 --> 43:01.160
and on the other side you see that neckbeard ship unfortunately has not gotten the sails

43:01.160 --> 43:03.160
up and ready to go yet.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.160
They have not caught wind.

43:05.160 --> 43:08.160
However the swing singers are off to a decent start.

43:08.160 --> 43:14.160
The fancy pyromancy on the DMC lurches like they got a fucking Mario Kart boost because

43:14.160 --> 43:21.160
they rolled a critical success and they jump to an early lead on the inside track as their

43:21.160 --> 43:33.160
cannons sink us and end the game.

43:36.160 --> 43:43.160
You see wood splinters flying off the ship of the swing sing brothers and you notice

43:43.160 --> 43:46.160
that a couple of them who are up in the air.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
What are they called?

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
What is a wooden part called?

43:48.160 --> 43:49.160
A mast.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.160
A mast.

43:50.160 --> 43:55.160
The mast that a couple of them are hanging from is just obliterated to the point to where

43:55.160 --> 44:03.160
it flies off the deck into the water dragging to these acrobatic pirates down into the water

44:03.160 --> 44:04.160
with it.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.160
People are screaming.

44:05.160 --> 44:11.160
Smoke is covering the entirety of the racing track.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.160
Oh isn't it a beautiful day Mitch?

44:14.160 --> 44:17.160
Oh yeah it's pretty nice out actually today.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.160
I'm at the blood and screams.

44:19.160 --> 44:23.160
Oh yeah and he throws up.

44:26.160 --> 44:31.160
Alabaster throws up for the second time today after seeing that.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.160
Alright alright get your stomach in order boys.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.160
It's time to start using your words.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.160
I don't like using my words.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.160
I like using my guns.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.160
Use those guns Alabaster.

44:42.160 --> 44:49.160
As Mitch wipes his mouth he takes a few deep breaths and begins.

44:49.160 --> 44:53.160
For a while in here.

44:53.160 --> 44:57.160
For a while in here.

44:57.160 --> 45:01.160
For a while in here.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.160
Miss Knife.

45:11.160 --> 45:15.160
We could also have Jesus Christ and Miss Knife team up to captain the ship.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
That's right.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.160
Who is Jesus Christ?

45:18.160 --> 45:20.160
That's my monkey.

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
Excellent.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.160
The new adventures of Jesus and Mrs. Knife.

45:48.160 --> 45:56.160
Thanks for watching.
