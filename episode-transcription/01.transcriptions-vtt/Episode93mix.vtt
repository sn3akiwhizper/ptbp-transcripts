which the army declined why on earth would they decline that

03:28.640 --> 03:30.960

an orphan spine that's how i like them so according to this uh article the uh there was a

06:57.600 --> 07:09.600

switching it and we'll see if it gets better yeah although it is fucking hilarious every time it's

07:33.920 --> 07:43.600
happened so i'm reading this article and it says uh i mean

07:45.680 --> 07:47.040
sometimes i just edit that out

07:49.760 --> 07:53.280
thomas were you on the call when i was talking about the product for the commercial shoot i

07:53.280 --> 07:59.760
did today no i'm not going to say the name of it but it's a wearable hand sanitizer and lotion

07:59.760 --> 08:08.080
dispenser that goes around your wrist cool and it looks like a giant cock ring awesome all of

08:08.080 --> 08:16.720
those things are cool the pot it's like pods full of one is full of lotion and the other one is full

08:16.720 --> 08:23.680
of hand sanitizer and they're on either side of your wrist it's a two inch long pod so your wrist

08:23.680 --> 08:32.160
is now a solid what seven eight inches wide uh-huh but at any time you can just be like

08:32.160 --> 08:36.960
so you could be walking through the park and somebody offers you a hot dog and you say oh

08:36.960 --> 08:41.840
yeah i could do that because i've got my hand sanitizer right here let me lotion up for this

08:41.840 --> 08:50.960
dog real quick it squirts out like one of those like uh gel deodorant sticks that you just kind

08:51.040 --> 08:56.400
of like squeeze out through holes on the top of it that's exactly what it looks like as it squeezes

08:56.400 --> 09:02.240
out so walk me through okay you you've you've pushed the pouch and it's squirted do you take

09:02.240 --> 09:07.760
your other hand and rub is that how it works so the hand that you are squeezing with it just kind

09:07.760 --> 09:17.760
of like stays on the product and then you rub off the lotion it was honestly one of the most batshit

09:17.760 --> 09:23.040
things i've ever seen i was like this is a joke right you gotta build up your imdb

09:23.040 --> 09:27.360
credits though yeah instead of getting paid i just just like can i have 10 of them

09:31.040 --> 09:34.480
i should have asked for one instead of getting paid that would have been that would have been

09:34.480 --> 09:43.360
fun i could put cool stuff in it mayonnaise and mustard oh my god then you could get a sandwich

09:43.360 --> 09:49.520
going anytime anywhere i like where your head's at that's exactly what you'd use it for

09:49.520 --> 09:57.120

seriously though uh home tip you can buy their fucking uh their burger and fry seasoning at the

10:28.720 --> 10:33.520
at the restaurants you can probably order it online but if you're making burgers at home

10:34.080 --> 10:40.000

10:40.640 --> 10:46.400

10:56.000 --> 11:01.760

11:26.720 --> 11:32.880
is the name uh all all old western groups have a have a cool name right the magnificent seven

11:33.440 --> 11:38.480
others i'm sure those are usually applied afterwards i think the fucking four

11:40.480 --> 11:46.080
fast and the four yes well that's it there are five of us here does he

11:48.080 --> 11:54.720
yeah custom i mean not that i do associate with this group yet but hypothetically if there was

11:54.720 --> 12:00.800
one would would you count really i feel like i'm the leader honestly he's been with us the whole

12:00.800 --> 12:07.520
time that's interesting that's i mean clearly uh clearly the judge is the alpha i think we were all

12:07.520 --> 12:13.360
looking at every pace to take control of this group at any point now if if bobby's part of

12:13.360 --> 12:20.320
the group we could be the fab five i don't understand the reference it just made it up

12:22.400 --> 12:29.760
the fab five it is professor you're gonna have to learn to be more oh i missed the joke fuck

12:29.760 --> 12:36.160
i'll hear it when i edit i just i just we're the fab we're the fab five where's the fab five

12:37.680 --> 12:39.040
that's that's not a joke

12:41.600 --> 12:48.160
and with that we're back into the reality is the 1880 some things with a burp from judge ephraim

12:48.720 --> 12:56.320
courtland the five of you are surveying from a distance the land bobby's from missouri

12:56.320 --> 13:02.800
nice i served him once yeah oh he's cool yeah preacher sheriff bobby custard not you

13:05.120 --> 13:15.200
uh you see that the gay man from the future new the typically bustling new mine is a ghost town

13:15.920 --> 13:20.240
normally men and women who work for coals contention mining company would be hustling

13:20.240 --> 13:26.080
about up and down stairs from platform to platform hauling loads of equipment with

13:26.080 --> 13:33.360
the conveyor continuously running a loud humming and the thick stench of sweat in the air today

13:33.360 --> 13:42.800
however it's quiet except for those same low barking growls that you heard earlier and there

13:42.880 --> 13:51.760
is a swarm i'm talking 12. is that a swarm is that enough for swarm 12 vultures

13:51.760 --> 13:56.320
is a lot of vultures observe everyone a small swarm of vultures

13:59.440 --> 14:05.280
you see him around here quite a bit lots of death and whatnot is it inherently weird to us that the

14:05.280 --> 14:11.920
mine isn't operating today or is it it is is it a known thing always in operation maybe they're

14:11.920 --> 14:20.400
installing fans in the mine that'd be awful nice of him i ain't known silas coal to be particularly

14:20.400 --> 14:26.400
worried about being nice to folks that's true he did steal my copper wire i don't know he he

14:26.400 --> 14:32.000
he does a lot for well even the courthouse you know got electricity before i guess it might have

14:32.000 --> 14:38.480
gotten stolen but we don't exactly know by whom except for miss kitty lizzie said it was his wife

14:39.440 --> 14:46.000
the little girl she said it was mary cole yeah you were right there didn't you hear i was right

14:46.000 --> 14:52.800
there huh let's go get her we can find out about the smashed watermelons or whatever but i need to

14:52.800 --> 14:57.440
get my wire i think we should probably stay the course to find the grave robbing miss kitty at

14:57.440 --> 15:02.480
this point that's that's kind of top priority we don't want any more graves dug up yeah i think

15:02.800 --> 15:10.240
your wire comes a second here afram judge why don't why don't we tie everything up uh later on

15:10.240 --> 15:15.280
in the day with your wire yeah well i figured if we were heading down there i'd bring it up but

15:15.280 --> 15:22.160
should we follow these horse tracks or the tracks do lead back down through the gate of the mine

15:22.800 --> 15:27.840
uh into the property that the coals own i'd like to go down there and touch this goo

15:27.840 --> 15:36.960
and you see that at the gate at his daily post is the mining company's security guard becker

15:36.960 --> 15:45.440
piston you know becker was a co-worker of silas coal down in the mine but when silas bought the

15:45.440 --> 15:51.520
mine he pulled becker up out of the ground sat him at that gate and he's been there ever since

15:52.160 --> 15:58.640
becker piston lives on the grounds far on the other side of the mine from the coal residence

15:58.640 --> 16:05.360
so basically one far end becker piston lives and you got the mine in the middle and then far on the

16:05.360 --> 16:11.920
other side you've got the residents of the coals and over the top of the entrance of the mine

16:12.480 --> 16:19.360
silas has built a three-story building with his office are we writing up to him

16:20.320 --> 16:27.760
oh that's up to you guys how do you would we know if becker is uh typically a violent person

16:27.760 --> 16:32.800
or anything or like unreasonable or do we just not would we not have known him in our day-to-day

16:32.800 --> 16:41.360
goings-ons going awnings is going awnings the word uh he is one of the chillest people

16:41.360 --> 16:47.440
that has ever existed not a lot bad happens around the mine silas runs a really tight ship

16:48.000 --> 16:53.920
and everyone gets paid on time he takes care of his employees and he takes care of the town at

16:53.920 --> 17:01.760
large and you know becker to be a glazed over chill are the tracks that we're following are

17:01.760 --> 17:07.120
they leading into the mine they are leading onto the property you wouldn't be able to

17:07.120 --> 17:14.080
quite trace where they are once they where are the vultures circling they're circling over the

17:14.080 --> 17:19.200
coal residents hey judge and uh custard we should try and get onto this here property

17:19.200 --> 17:24.480
don't you think i think old uh old becker would uh i think he'll be cool with it

17:24.480 --> 17:29.760
yeah he ought to be uh we got a warrant wink wink let's go

17:34.000 --> 17:35.520
took a quick suckle of a teat

17:38.400 --> 17:40.480
so we go to the property

17:40.480 --> 17:43.280
i am

17:46.400 --> 17:48.960
judge preacher doctor

17:53.040 --> 17:57.600

18:51.200 --> 19:01.040
from becker yes come on man becker we know you're you're all the opium you're the opium connection

19:11.280 --> 19:19.120
uh hey uh you sure you sure to be on that last one remember i know it's hard to count and you're

19:19.200 --> 19:26.480

reaches into his vest pocket and pulls out a small little bottle uh can you not take it all

20:07.920 --> 20:15.520
because this is i get out a uh pre-rolled cigarette and like drip the opium all over it

professor green snatches it in mid pass and takes a dropper of it

20:28.240 --> 20:35.680
every time there's drugs in the role-playing game everybody wants to do if you if you if

20:35.680 --> 20:42.960
you'll remember it's my idea to do your drugs first you get the credit then i just wanted us

20:42.960 --> 20:49.520

20:49.520 --> 20:55.360
of like hand it reach over to horace you know i don't agree with you about much but i do agree

21:04.000 --> 21:11.360
the cigarette i like take a few pulls from my flask and it's like dribbling down my chin i'm

21:11.360 --> 21:18.320
like i declined the flask but i pass it on to the group along with the cigarette

21:19.760 --> 21:27.120
oh interesting uh preacher sheriff bobby custard passes the cigarette oh were you not gonna give

21:28.000 --> 21:34.640
hora sees him go for that and he's like he he remembers that all right you're in the fab five

21:37.040 --> 21:43.280
so he starts to yank it away and then reluctantly he's like all right well he just passes the

21:43.280 --> 21:49.680
cigarette immediately back to ever at pace and takes a drag off the flask uh ever it's gonna

21:49.680 --> 21:58.320
take the cigarette and and look at it kind of funny huh okay i gave the stuff up a while here

21:58.320 --> 22:06.080

22:06.080 --> 22:10.640
nerves i don't i don't have any nerves preacher sheriff doctor kind of ticks his head to the side

22:10.640 --> 22:17.040
oh oh as much as you oh as much as you custard i make all my important decisions on this stuff

22:17.120 --> 22:19.920
i don't have any nerves yeah

22:22.320 --> 22:30.080
jack pearlman's gonna take just the the tiniest drag off the drag yeah bill clinton drag off the

22:30.080 --> 22:35.280
the cigarette since he's been losing a little sanity he figures something to help calm his

22:35.280 --> 22:41.040
nerves a little bit but not a lot because he's not his vices is alky hall and then he takes he

22:41.040 --> 22:45.920
takes a big old pull off the flask though but he wipes it first because he thinks it's nasty

22:45.920 --> 22:52.160
because it is it is it's nasty every pace go ahead and roll listen for me

22:55.200 --> 23:03.920
i pass a 25 on a 40 okay uh everybody else take your headphones off nothing happens

23:05.920 --> 23:08.240
you listen and listen and there's nothing

23:08.240 --> 23:18.400
except for dumbasses doing drugs making their characters a little bit less effective

23:28.080 --> 23:31.920
every pace you're listening well you're just you're just sitting there but well during this

23:31.920 --> 23:40.160
whole conversation about passing the drugs and doing the drugs and everything you hear from the

23:40.160 --> 23:49.040
home of the coals some sort of spat two voices being raised back and forth and then with that

23:49.040 --> 23:55.040
successful listen check you hear you can just make it out it's just traveling on the wind

23:55.280 --> 24:02.720
just enough to reach your ears are you here silas cole say yeah i said it's it's fine

24:03.920 --> 24:12.480
i know how to handle it i know how to handle her she's out just trust me i know how to handle her

24:12.480 --> 24:20.640
or it i know how to handle it i know how to handle her okay she's out just trust me

24:20.800 --> 24:25.120
just trust me okay that's all

24:33.840 --> 24:38.960
hey hey everybody quiet down quiet down let the coals they're they're fighting about something

24:38.960 --> 24:43.200
over there's something going on over at the coal house i don't know how the listen check works if

24:43.200 --> 24:50.320
i do if i point that out can they all hear it then can he share his with us oh we can

24:50.560 --> 24:57.440
we just make checks or uh no however at this exact moment the door of the coal residence

24:58.800 --> 25:07.360
opens and you see silas cole roughed up hair huge pants wearing a belt and suspenders

25:08.320 --> 25:18.640
carrying a rug over his shoulder and he lugs it into the back of his wagon

25:18.640 --> 25:27.280
one of his wagons here on the coal property and he begins unhinging his horses and preparing them

25:27.920 --> 25:38.960
for a trip and i'm gonna roll to see and uh he goes about his business slowly and steady-handedly

25:38.960 --> 25:43.440
oh shit fellas i think there might be i think there might be somebody in that rug i heard him

25:43.440 --> 25:49.120
say i heard him say that he he had handled it and and he knew how to handle her and that she was out

25:49.120 --> 25:52.320
and i didn't know what that meant but what if he meant that she was knocked out what if she's in

25:52.320 --> 26:01.360
that rug i believe that that theory is plausible mr pace judge sheriff should we yeah should we

26:02.720 --> 26:09.680
i say confront ourselves should we confront him now or i say any excuse to string that

26:09.680 --> 26:16.800
boy but judge he is the reason that this town is what it is if we get rid of silas cole

26:16.800 --> 26:22.880
contention is nothing you're gonna get him let him get away with murder well we get at least i mean

26:23.760 --> 26:28.720
we could talk to him before we're done hanging by a rope well i wasn't gonna hang him before

26:28.720 --> 26:33.360
we find out who would kill i didn't say he killed anybody i think she might just be knocked out

26:33.360 --> 26:38.480
it's he says she's out custard i think we should ride which way hey becker anybody else come

26:38.480 --> 26:56.240
through here recently uh no just the normal stuff no work today so why is that mary and

26:56.960 --> 27:07.040
silas had stuff they needed to take care of sounds fishy well i didn't have fish last night but the

27:07.040 --> 27:14.800
night before i did oh you said sounds not smells i was worried that maybe shut up i was letting

27:14.800 --> 27:21.120
off a stink that you shut up let's go custard i think we should ride towards silas and stop him

27:21.120 --> 27:25.600
before he does something he might regret hey on now hang on now there's a chance that silas is

27:25.600 --> 27:30.400
the good guy here what if he found miss kitty she was in a tizzy she he knocked her out and he's

27:30.400 --> 27:35.680
bringing her back into town as we speak maybe we should go ask about that in a rug i mean if

27:35.680 --> 27:42.320
he's doing something that's okay we get to talk to him and feel him out see if he's nervous you

27:42.320 --> 27:48.560
know are we like uh hidden behind a rock or something no uh roll stealth actually all of

27:48.560 --> 27:56.400
us asking that question no just thomas i just just wanted to make a joke about coughing and saying

27:56.400 --> 27:58.080
keith really loud and seeing if he looks

28:05.760 --> 28:12.880
74 on professor horse green super stealthy nope he has the baseline 20

28:14.560 --> 28:20.560
uh then there is not a big rock here and you could have made that rock appear brother

28:21.440 --> 28:28.000
that's how i like to roleplay oh god ever is tottering out toward their wagon let's go let

28:28.000 --> 28:36.400
me make a roll here real quick actually um now i'll roll it when you yell keith because you don't

28:36.400 --> 28:42.000
do it in actuality because you wouldn't know to do that that'd be a wild thing it was it's about

28:42.000 --> 28:51.920
something else sorry thomas yelled keith really loud and then silas cole immediately looked up

28:55.520 --> 29:01.520
thomas busted his head into the truman show like through the dome above

29:03.600 --> 29:05.760

35:39.040 --> 35:44.720
after i tell him to open the rug up what does he do he reaches for his gun i reach for my gun and

you can roll intimidate okay to see if you hit or not 52 on a 60. oh fuck describe it baby

36:19.680 --> 36:26.640
i aim the gun at him and he's like whoa i'm just adjusting my thing and i go sure and just right

36:26.640 --> 36:31.840
onto his face a big like i haven't drank water only whiskey recently so it's just a thick

36:32.720 --> 36:42.240
whiskey chewing tobacco blob just sticks to his forehead uh yeah go ahead and roll a d6

36:42.240 --> 36:47.760
and we'll see if it's a one two or three he'll be disabled for one round if it's a four five

36:47.760 --> 36:58.800
six he's disabled for two rounds five two rounds uh fucking thick ass glob just covers both his eyes

37:00.320 --> 37:07.200
fill him with lead boys and can i just stumble can i jump off my horse backwards

37:07.760 --> 37:14.560
and no fuck you no great turn you did stay on your horse i'm telling a story

37:17.760 --> 37:24.160
he stumbles backwards and his hand comes off of his holster and he just falls through his knees

37:24.160 --> 37:31.280
and begins collecting dirt from the ground and trying to get the the juices out of his

37:31.280 --> 37:39.920
eyes and he's just like oh it burns preacher sheriff dr bobby custard hops off of his horse

37:40.720 --> 37:50.240
and grabs a pair of shackles from his side bag and begins approaching silas cole and it is everett

37:50.240 --> 37:58.000
pace's turn he's gonna he's gonna hold out his hands to bobby custard help me down help me down

38:04.480 --> 38:09.600
the reason that preacher sheriff dr bobby custard couldn't get all the way to putting the

38:10.080 --> 38:19.920
shackles onto silas cole is because he turned around halfway and helps everett pace off of

38:19.920 --> 38:27.680
bucky i put you up there it would be a shame if i didn't help you down it just go quicker is all

yeah uh you can get to the back of the carpet and when you get there

38:37.920 --> 38:46.000

science experiments all over town just blending in

42:35.440 --> 42:43.840
actually it looks come to think of it it's this old revolver uh it's like got wood on the sides

42:43.840 --> 42:46.880
and this like big ass cylinder

42:47.120 --> 42:47.600
oh

42:50.880 --> 42:57.200
oh no nothing else strange about it just a big cylinder on this motherfucker fucking dope

42:59.600 --> 43:04.640
ah henry points it at himself and wants to end it all who does oris

43:05.440 --> 43:08.400
do

43:11.520 --> 43:14.640
no it's not the end we're not there yet oh if that happened

43:15.360 --> 43:21.840
fuck you let me take chorus to the future uh let me go p real quick also there's no

43:21.840 --> 43:27.680
weird tubes or lights or anything on it but i'm gonna go pee also same i'm not gonna good

43:27.680 --> 43:33.200
joe just stay there you fuck now i can be mean to you no one's here to hear what i'm saying

43:33.280 --> 43:37.600
done already did the peas though i don't piss seven times in my pants all

43:38.240 --> 43:43.200
it's recording the whole time we're recording piss my britches just now

43:46.160 --> 43:50.880
thomas that thought that green light was lit baby he thought there were tubes on that gun

43:50.880 --> 43:58.160
and he was ready to leave but it also would make any sense to uh for his character to shoot himself

43:59.120 --> 44:01.440
henry henry would never do something like that

44:03.200 --> 44:11.040
so

44:11.040 --> 44:15.520
the guy who i prevented from drinking his own throw up one night because he

44:15.520 --> 44:20.960
because he's because he threw up into his water glass after drinking games and he was about to

44:20.960 --> 44:28.240
drink and i was like no i'd like grab his cup from him it's like you're gonna die you said that

44:28.240 --> 44:38.800
at a funeral do what what are you eating there bud hot dog

44:44.320 --> 44:46.640
i can't wait to try to cut that into something

44:50.320 --> 44:53.760
damn a hot dog every episode just starts with hot dog

44:54.640 --> 45:00.320
it's like our absolute get it cut to the drums of no backbone

45:09.200 --> 45:14.800
do you guys want me to make you one yeah please boil some dogs over and leave them on your

45:14.800 --> 45:21.040
doorstep for me wait boil you don't like boiled dogs no you gotta put it in the microwave

45:21.360 --> 45:26.080
oh boilings no that is all you have to do microwave with water fucking put it in

45:26.080 --> 45:29.920
put it in the bun you don't even need water just put it in the bun and microwave it for

45:29.920 --> 45:34.240
30 seconds and it tastes exactly like a fucking boiled dog that's true i don't like my buns

45:34.240 --> 45:39.520
microwaved you hey man if you want to feed yourself in exactly 30 seconds that's actually

45:39.520 --> 45:45.440
a good i never do it cannot be beat do you like a good cold hot dog no you don't know

45:45.440 --> 45:49.760
it's different it's different when i will eat a cold hot dog i used to like cold hot

45:49.760 --> 45:55.280
dogs and then i had one recently and it was not the thing that i remember like my taste buds had

45:55.280 --> 46:02.000
changed or something i was not into it leaves on your teeth yeah exactly uh positive i'd say no

46:02.000 --> 46:08.320
hot dogs are bad the type of dogs they used to use when extinct so for you the cold ones don't

46:08.320 --> 46:15.440
taste as good now that's true i like bread pug meat yeah if i'm eating a dick sandwich it's going

46:15.440 --> 46:20.320
to be a brat for sure controversial opinion but hot dogs are way better i like both for different

46:20.320 --> 46:26.000
reasons but i think i like hot dogs more my dad has been making his own brats lately and they're

46:26.000 --> 46:37.280
fucking great my daddy's brats are better than yours oh no he's back he's arrived i love my dad's

46:37.280 --> 46:43.920
sausage so what i what i like to do that god if you boil them and you slice them dogs in half

46:43.920 --> 46:48.720
lengthwise i think like where and then you fry them in a pan hot dog style yeah that can be good

46:48.720 --> 46:52.480
they get a good crust on the bottom and you can throw them on a sandwich instead of eating them

46:52.480 --> 46:58.160
on a bun because they come out to like being more of a rectangular square so you got log sandwich

46:58.160 --> 47:02.800
yeah it's flat on the bottom and then like round on the top if that makes sense oh no i love it

47:02.800 --> 47:08.960
the shape you cut it completely in half or do you leave a little bit so it's all one piece no i don't

47:08.960 --> 47:13.680
do that oh you mean like yeah so they splay open right but it's still connected yeah but it's still

47:13.680 --> 47:18.800
open like so yeah if this is your hot dog like a hoagie and then you splay it open no like

47:18.800 --> 47:26.800
justin's mom when you split my mom in half and fryer or like that fucking dude in bone tomahawk

47:26.800 --> 47:33.200
holy shit have you guys seen that movie bone tomahawk bone tomahawk these guys should both

47:33.200 --> 47:41.680
watch it it's fucking brutal i watched it to like get myself set up for running this old west story

47:41.680 --> 47:51.040
which clearly like i learned a ton about the old west and the ceiling fans horse in horse garters

47:51.040 --> 47:59.760
or whatever what about bone tomahawk yeah he's on he's on my uh celebrity pass list

47:59.760 --> 48:10.160
the hidden character bone tony yeah it was a dlc code on halloween if you collect 12

48:10.160 --> 48:16.240
tapes the 13th one is of thomas and bone tomahawk when thomas is on one of his passes

48:18.080 --> 48:22.240
thomas is waggling his eyebrows who knows if any of this will be in the actual let's hope not

48:22.240 --> 48:27.760
all right i pray to god every day yeah we're in the we're like in the middle of a oh yeah what

48:27.760 --> 48:37.680
were we doing we were in combat and it is now technically at an end because silas cole is done

48:37.680 --> 48:48.640
got and so judge and preacher sheriff doctor are both behind the shackled silas cole and ever at

48:48.640 --> 48:56.160
pace is around back of this wagon looking at this rug and the feet that are inside of it with shoes

48:56.160 --> 49:03.680
that he does not recognize but they're just weird and pearlman and green are walking around back

49:04.320 --> 49:11.040
and the three of them are discussing what to do oh i think jack was helping me pull out the rug

49:11.040 --> 49:16.880
when we left off and now that green uh has disarmed cole he's gonna go help them too ever

49:16.880 --> 49:25.440
at pace jack pearlman and professor horace green you begin moving this rug out from the back of

49:25.440 --> 49:35.840
this wagon the sun is high in the sky and the rug casts a shadow directly beneath it as sweat drips

49:35.840 --> 49:45.280
from each of your brows and this humid summer thick air are you gonna thunk the other side

49:45.280 --> 49:50.960
onto the ground or are you going to like slowly place it onto the ground i figured we'd set it

49:50.960 --> 49:56.000
down and then give it a fun yank so it all unravels horse green says that to the group

49:56.000 --> 50:01.360
i think we should lay it gently on the ground and then give the end a fun uh a fun yank so it

50:01.360 --> 50:06.560
unravels quickly and whatever's inside comes whoop just zipping out but i mean it's it's

50:06.560 --> 50:10.160
it's a person they they could they could be knocked out they could they could get hurt if

50:10.160 --> 50:15.760
we're not careful here whoever is inside sorry yeah i think we should be careful i think we

50:15.760 --> 50:22.480
should over ever come on we can we can do this alone there's a little bit of urgency in evert's

50:22.480 --> 50:27.040
process here i mean he thinks there's a chance that there's a knocked out unconscious person

50:27.040 --> 50:32.560
in here maybe not just a dead body so he's gonna he's gonna try and get her to the ground and

50:32.560 --> 50:37.360
start maybe unrolling it maybe get around to the other side so he can make sure the head is there

50:37.360 --> 50:44.720
and that not not bashed or anything and he wants to unravel the carpet and jack helps as ever at

50:44.720 --> 50:49.680
pace and jack pearlman are doing this kind of slowly unrolling professor horse green kind of

50:49.680 --> 50:57.280
reaches into the middle as it's unrolling and just i got outvoted oh okay i was just gonna

50:57.280 --> 51:06.160
help out your cause i suppose so you guys unroll it slowly but surely and ever is moving his hands

51:06.160 --> 51:13.440
kind of into the rug and you do you feel ahead of hair on the opposite side then i want to i want to

51:13.680 --> 51:20.240
i want to try and stabilize that head neck area as it's unrolling trying to make sure we don't

51:20.240 --> 51:26.080
cause undue harm to that body in there uh yeah go ahead and roll first aid hey i'm glad you asked

51:26.080 --> 51:38.000
because i got a high one i pass uh 54 on a 70 this body that comes rolling slowly gently out of this

51:38.000 --> 51:47.360
rug is wearing clothes that you've never seen before and colors of cloth so bright you'd think

51:47.360 --> 51:57.920
that this teenage girl might be some sort of royalty and her hair is patchy and thin on top

51:57.920 --> 52:07.680
the scalp kind of peeling away holes have formed in the middle of it and all of her skin is the

52:07.680 --> 52:15.920
same way at her cheekbones the skin is so thin that there's a slight cut underneath each eye

52:15.920 --> 52:23.120
fresh cut and so blood is pouring down like tears from eyes that are right below tear ducts

52:23.760 --> 52:27.680
but her eyes are closed until they aren't

52:27.680 --> 52:42.400
oh no until db mitchell lets out a massive deep unnatural

52:48.080 --> 52:51.680
get the brickhouse lady here i think that's german

52:58.240 --> 53:09.680
so

53:18.480 --> 53:23.680
i'm afraid

53:27.680 --> 53:29.680
so

53:35.040 --> 53:40.000
all around my poor little darling i'm afraid they'll get my darling

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling all around

53:46.000 --> 53:53.680
my poor little darling i'm afraid they'll get my darling

53:57.680 --> 53:59.680
so

54:06.560 --> 54:07.680
hot dog
