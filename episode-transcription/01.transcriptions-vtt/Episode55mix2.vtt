00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Welcome one, welcome all, welcome y'all, wait a minute, did I say this all before?

00:09.640 --> 00:12.880
Have I lived this moment in another time?

00:12.880 --> 00:18.560
It feels like I'm having one of them damn dirty deja vu moments, where you feel like

00:18.560 --> 00:24.380
you did a thing before in an alternate reality type deal maybe, but now you're doing it in

00:24.380 --> 00:31.700
this one for the first time, but a second time, anyway.

00:31.700 --> 00:36.500
Speaking of endless cycles of torture that I am forced to relive every week, it's time

00:36.500 --> 00:38.420
for Howlin' with Wolf.

00:38.420 --> 00:43.060
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Ian, who wrote a five star review of this show

00:43.060 --> 00:45.820
like the sweet, sweet boy he is.

00:45.820 --> 00:50.500
Hey everybody, be more like Ian, he writes.

00:50.500 --> 00:54.040
Dear Wolf, I hope this letter finds you well.

00:54.040 --> 00:57.400
Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of your show.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.920
Not only for the soothing sounds you howl through the airwaves each week, your DJing

01:01.920 --> 01:07.920
prowess and your spectacularly diverse discography, but you are hands down the most reliable source

01:07.920 --> 01:14.200
of news that the mainstream media won't report on, those otherworldly happenings in the town

01:14.200 --> 01:15.900
of contention.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.280
My neighbor's got a sister in contention, and even he doesn't know what's going on.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.180
Then again, he really hasn't been himself since last week when I returned that shiny

01:26.180 --> 01:29.540
ball bearing he dropped out in the parking lot.

01:29.540 --> 01:34.200
Didn't even thank me, he's usually a pretty chill guy, but the other night he woke up

01:34.200 --> 01:39.840
half the apartment complex screaming and carrying on at two in the morning, thrashing and banging

01:39.840 --> 01:43.560
around like we're living in college dorms again or something.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.640
When I knocked on his door to ask what the hell he was doing, or more importantly why

01:48.640 --> 01:54.400
he was spattered and marinara and holding what looked like a fake spinal cord, he just

01:54.400 --> 01:59.160
said, uh, Halloween, and shut the door in my face.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.620
It ain't even October, now he just stares at me coldly every time I pass by on my way

02:04.620 --> 02:08.960
to the mailbox, sorry, totally got sidetracked there.

02:08.960 --> 02:14.240
Anyway, love the show, keep on howling the good howling snapping those pearly fangs at

02:14.240 --> 02:17.480
Mark Zuckerberg's milk toast android ass.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.080
You're the wolf now, dawg, your friend and admirer, Ian.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
P.S.

02:23.080 --> 02:28.080
If you could do me a huge favor and dig into the deep cuts, I'd love to hear you spin something

02:28.080 --> 02:30.960
a little different from the usual setlist.

02:30.960 --> 02:35.160
Do you have no backbone by kudzu in your collection?

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
Thanks a million.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.360
No, thank you, listener.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.600
All-profit news stations are designed to keep you scared and coming back so they can make

02:44.600 --> 02:46.720
that sweet, sweet cash money.

02:46.720 --> 02:53.640
I like to keep y'all scared, but I do it for free because I'm a true radio journalist DJ

02:53.640 --> 03:00.720
of high caliber, and, uh, it gets me off to know the power I hold, and, baby, you know

03:00.720 --> 03:05.320
I'm always scrounging for them deepest of cuts when it comes to tunes.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.000
I might have a little something special just for you this time.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.760
Remember, if you want to write a message for me to read on air, tag us on Instagram or

03:14.760 --> 03:20.480
Twitter at PretendingPod, or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts and email us

03:20.480 --> 03:23.280
at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.320
And the conglomerate of pretending to be people want me to keep shouting out that they are

03:27.320 --> 03:34.080
taking questions for a third Q&A episode, so if you have questions for any of the mature,

03:34.080 --> 03:40.200
most thoughtful adults who make that show, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.560
There's also a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions.

03:44.560 --> 03:49.400
Or go all out, record audio of you asking a question and send that so they can use it

03:49.400 --> 03:50.960
in the episode.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.920
Same as the second Q&A episode, this one will be for our honorary police officers over on

03:55.920 --> 04:01.240
Patreon who plug the holes of this sinking ship five bucks a month at a time.

04:01.240 --> 04:06.400
The anthropomorphic corks who hold this whole thing together currently have instant access

04:06.400 --> 04:13.240
to six exclusive bonus episodes, with more on its way, so much more.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.080
Now if you want a question answered but you can't rationalize making room in your budget,

04:18.080 --> 04:19.080
fear not.

04:19.080 --> 04:24.680
There are already so many questions the PTBP crew won't be able to get to all of them.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.720
For some of the questions missed on the recording, the boys will journey into the hardline mainframe

04:29.720 --> 04:33.720
network and answer right there inside your phone or laptop.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.520
They'll be all up inside them internet guts.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.800
Speaking of crawling into other people's business, it's the news.

04:41.800 --> 04:47.640
Clock Bishop Keith Vigna and John Lee Pettymore the fourth, in the body of John Lee Pettymore

04:47.640 --> 04:52.140
the third, woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein.

04:52.140 --> 04:55.800
They had four names branded on different parts of their bodies.

04:55.800 --> 05:01.760
On the backs Drew, on the bottom of their left foot Maggie, on the palms of their dominant

05:01.760 --> 05:07.720
hands Tilly, and on the chests Marvin, but Marvin is crossed out.

05:07.720 --> 05:14.120
After realizing they have the moments of the, I guess successful, raid on the glass compound,

05:14.120 --> 05:18.980
the three former officers from contention began to understand the situation they found

05:18.980 --> 05:20.200
themselves in.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.940
Clark tried to summon another version of himself, looked a little too deep into his collective

05:25.940 --> 05:30.800
unconsciousness and received a phone call from his former boss.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.040
Taking us now to the parking lot of the city cemetery where Maggie Cook just assigned the

05:36.040 --> 05:41.960
three dilapidated husks of humanity she once called co-workers with the task of taking

05:41.960 --> 05:43.400
out Bruce Robin.

05:43.400 --> 05:49.000
Ferguson Bean's former business partner is a personal favorite of mine and a brand new

05:49.000 --> 05:51.720
single from Kudzu.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.080
Y'all ain't never gonna guess what it is.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.440
It's no backbone baby I fooled y'all.

05:58.440 --> 06:25.880
I am John Lee Paddymore, doo da doo da, I am John Lee Paddymore, oh the doo da day.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.440
We sound cool.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.920
So you guys woke up in the tomb of Ari Manstein and then you realized like you do and you

06:35.920 --> 06:41.460
realized that Marvin which was carved into your chest or burned into your chest rather

06:41.460 --> 06:47.040
is crossed through with the same sort of burning all the way through which we took as a clear

06:47.040 --> 06:52.120
indication that that was done and we have nothing to follow up on there and you didn't

06:52.120 --> 07:00.880
talk about it at all well and then eventually leaving the tomb you ran into the old woman

07:00.880 --> 07:08.880
making her way out of the cemetery and she was so slow oh my god and that's when you

07:08.880 --> 07:13.920
realized that you had been here before the thing that you had been debating up until

07:13.920 --> 07:18.520
that point she had seen us run through before exactly and then you almost ruined the entire

07:18.520 --> 07:24.960
podcast by just standing there and waiting that's not totally off the table yeah we still

07:24.960 --> 07:30.560
might do that and I don't understand how uh pushing you to new creative heights by thinking

07:30.560 --> 07:37.200
outside the box is ruining the podcast I say what's ruining the podcast okay okay okay

07:37.200 --> 07:45.440
podcast strike boys our characters sit there and wait we're out and no one's allowed to

07:45.440 --> 07:56.560
cross us Zach just hires scabs so with us this week we've got Ali Jepson playing John

07:56.560 --> 08:02.660
Lee Pettymore he just does all the voices himself he's like finally my dream the game

08:02.660 --> 08:08.080
will go the way I want it to go so you guys are all standing in the parking lot Maggie

08:08.080 --> 08:14.460
Cook has joined you she has driven up into this parking lot and has given you a job to

08:14.460 --> 08:22.720
do which is to take out or essentially murder Bruce Robin full owner of bar Corp and the

08:22.720 --> 08:29.420
one-time business partner of Keith vigna's brother Ferguson beans she is sitting in this

08:29.420 --> 08:36.260
car broken down crying after having a conversation with John Lee Pettymore the third who well

08:36.260 --> 08:40.800
there's something yeah there's something I want to add to that actually that I just kind

08:40.800 --> 08:46.540
of realized you're allowed to you know Maggie I know this is a hard time for you reckoning

08:46.540 --> 08:52.120
with my undeath and all but I I just realized I'm doing the same thing with you what the

08:52.120 --> 08:58.340
fuck how are you alive and as you ask that her phone starts to ring I like I put my hand

08:58.340 --> 09:04.480
on her hand and I'm like Maggie tell me damn it she looks at the call as Clark Bishop is

09:04.480 --> 09:10.720
walking back over to join the group after looking at his cell phone and his car there

09:10.720 --> 09:18.120
she looks at the phone she puts it down she's like alright I John I gotta take this just

09:18.120 --> 09:23.440
real quick and then I'll explain okay I need Joe to roll an alertness check for me real

09:23.440 --> 09:37.400
quick I pass 18 or 70 Joe as you walk back you actually hear a second vibration so her

09:37.400 --> 09:50.120
phone is ringing and you hear a second buzzing at a different pitch we're from from inside

09:50.120 --> 09:57.480
her car where she's sitting in the driver's seat and then she picks up the phone Leon oh okay Lee

09:57.480 --> 10:08.240
Leon do you trust me and do your fucking job Leon I know it's been a while but knock the dust off

10:08.240 --> 10:15.520
your knuckles and buckle up what controls this world Leon that's right bitch it's fire and as

10:15.520 --> 10:20.360
soon as she's done speaking she hangs up she looks at you and she's like I never died John I

10:20.360 --> 10:31.840
had to disappear whose body was that doesn't matter she just how did you get so cool John

10:31.840 --> 10:37.040
I've always been this cool I think you've just been too drunk to notice and then she grabs an

10:37.040 --> 10:44.400
envelope out of her shotgun seat and she throws it to you right out the window and she looks at

10:44.400 --> 10:52.040
you and she's like remember I'm counting on you just Maggie just because I gave you bourbon for

10:52.040 --> 11:04.480
Christmas doesn't mean I'm a drunk cheap shitty bourbon and then she drives off to clarify the

11:04.480 --> 11:09.480
high-pitched buzzing that I heard she didn't acknowledge she did not got it but it sounded

11:09.480 --> 11:14.720
just like a cell phone yes got it open that envelope so isn't that a little blur the manila

11:14.720 --> 11:23.040
envelope has a manila folder inside labeled operation hole puncher colon bar Corp you remember the

11:23.040 --> 11:31.960
we found that in the secret room with the Jim Cook's house in the secret room can you remind

11:31.960 --> 11:40.000
us what we knew about it operation home I'm sorry of course we remember everything can you remind

11:40.000 --> 11:47.920
the listeners there was a folder on the desk in that room that secret hidden room that said

11:47.920 --> 11:53.960
operation hole puncher on the outside of it with the logo for the circle of knowledge the circle

11:53.960 --> 12:00.680
surrounded by six circles and inside there is a list of nonprofits charities think tanks and

12:00.680 --> 12:09.160
universities that are quote-unquote owned by the spark or knowledge oh okay where have we heard

12:09.160 --> 12:19.440
bar Corp before that's a Fergie and Bruce Roberts Robbins beans and Robin corporation is bar Corp one

12:19.440 --> 12:25.160
of those that's listed under companies owned by the circle of knowledge or yes it's in that list

12:25.160 --> 12:30.600
yes okay I found where I wrote down this in my real-life notebook and I wrote down each each

12:30.600 --> 12:35.480
company has date slash phone that phone number next to it isn't still the case so that was a

12:35.480 --> 12:41.600
different folder than this one this one gotcha a lot of information just about bar Corp in it

12:41.600 --> 12:47.440
whereas the other one was just a list of companies with a name and her biome got it so inside is a

12:47.440 --> 12:54.920
full rundown of bar Corp it's two owners Ferguson beans and Bruce Robin it's three subsidiaries

12:55.200 --> 13:02.160
Jesus Christ ministries health and rehabilitation unlimited and the Learning Center and its annual

13:02.160 --> 13:09.120
gross profits from the last five years which has been steadily rising last year bar Corp made just

13:09.120 --> 13:17.680
over 850 million dollars paid zero dollars in taxes and there's an estimate that this year they

13:17.680 --> 13:24.760
will make over two billion dollars you also see that Ferguson beans is marked as deceased his

13:24.760 --> 13:33.400
majority share in the company was split between his wife Stacy his daughter Francis and the mill

13:33.400 --> 13:39.000
on the other side of the city this leaves the majority in the legal document that is how it's

13:39.000 --> 13:44.680
listed in the legal documents this leaves the majority ownership to Bruce Robin there are

13:44.680 --> 13:52.480
addresses listed for Ferguson beans home Bruce Robbins home the bar Corp headquarters and all

13:52.480 --> 13:57.840
three subsidiaries Jesus Christ ministries health and rehabilitation unlimited and the

13:57.840 --> 14:04.000
Learning Center is Jesus Christ ministries in contingent Jesus Christ ministries is actually

14:04.000 --> 14:10.000
let's see it's in the city it's the one that he showed up to at the drug deal right you could

14:10.000 --> 14:14.280
tell them in character what you know about Jesus Christ ministries that's what I know right that

14:14.280 --> 14:19.600
you'll happen a long time ago yeah for Thomas for Thomas yeah I think maybe two nights ago

14:20.160 --> 14:36.680
yeah oh yeah I've just recently killed Jesus Christ ministries is a church camp that is outside

14:36.680 --> 14:43.320
the city hey Jesus Christ ministries I sold some cocaine to them you so yeah you know that cocaine

14:43.400 --> 14:49.960
we got from the yeah from from the lockers there I sold that me I sold that to a church I didn't

14:49.960 --> 14:55.080
know it was to a church I just heard that but my associate had a good had a good connection and it

14:55.080 --> 15:00.760
turned out to be a very fancily dressed man well in a van that what was he wearing I remember very

15:00.760 --> 15:07.040
very plainly the red rose pinned to his lapel Keith's face kind of drops a little bit he pulls

15:07.040 --> 15:15.320
out his phone opens up a picture of Ferguson to him yeah that's my brother oh he was fucking

15:15.320 --> 15:24.000
weird that makes sense so John you sold evidence cocaine to aren't we past that too I mean we've

15:24.000 --> 15:34.920
been personally a giant ball monster like how you gonna worry about me selling a little bit of you

15:34.920 --> 15:40.080
know contraband some good times I guess I guess we are a little past procedure but I wonder what

15:40.080 --> 15:44.700
Fergie was doing with that did you know your brother to be a dealer I didn't really know my

15:44.700 --> 15:49.080
brother that well towards the end anyway well he was there with a bunch of kids so maybe he was

15:49.080 --> 15:55.840
giving it to them he had kids at the drug deal the ministry yeah he drove up in a ministry van and he

15:55.840 --> 16:02.800
got out with a bunch of little children's and and they they dug up the cocaine that I had buried on

16:02.800 --> 16:11.600
my property he made the kids dig up the cocaine Keith sounds like your brother sucks he sucked

16:11.600 --> 16:18.520
how are you doing with that you know I I made the decision what do you mean I mean I can't take it

16:18.520 --> 16:23.600
back now I'm just trying not to think about it a lot happened in the past couple days you killed

16:23.600 --> 16:41.480
Fergie no I can say 100% with without lying to you I didn't kill him what decision did you make

16:41.480 --> 16:48.480
Keith I will say if it wasn't for me he'd probably still be alive but I didn't kill him if I remember

16:48.480 --> 16:53.200
right Marvin Glass mentioned all this when you and I were in his office while it was flooded

16:53.520 --> 17:01.160
anyway I think that I know that yeah office when it flooded well yeah Keith when we were in the

17:01.160 --> 17:06.400
office when it was all you know what we can we can talk about that later looks like we got other

17:06.400 --> 17:11.880
stuff to focus on wait wait hold on Marvin's office flooded with you in it because the last

17:11.880 --> 17:16.160
thing we saw was Marvin and a bunch of people bursting out of a flooded office well we had

17:16.160 --> 17:21.760
been in the office when it was flooded and then before right after that we kind of just woke up

17:22.000 --> 17:29.040
thrown into combat see I was a I was trying to save you and I saw your body was pressed against

17:29.040 --> 17:34.920
a window down there and I shot it out and then all hell broke loose so what do we think happened

17:34.920 --> 17:42.960
between then and John we were after the the room flooded I'd he Marvin grabbed a hold of me grabbed

17:42.960 --> 17:51.320
a key showed up eventually but he he hope he opened you up he popped you open and there was

17:52.320 --> 18:03.240
one of those one of those little silver balls was inside of you well yeah hey boys we might all be

18:03.240 --> 18:10.520
silver balls just so you know there could be a silver ball on you right now oh yeah I mean I'm

18:10.520 --> 18:18.840
pretty sure I am the silver ball when my Kevin father killed my my err body my first John yeah

18:18.840 --> 18:25.840
what happened then is that I burst out of my own spine and into his because I think I'm just a

18:25.840 --> 18:30.600
little ball that rings that rings a bell actually because I've seen those balls rip spines out of

18:30.600 --> 18:36.560
people before and pop themselves in the place I mean I saw that when I was looking at videos

18:36.560 --> 18:43.920
at the glass compound I saw that happen a couple times on video so well so yeah so I'm a ball and

18:43.920 --> 18:52.400
as you can see I have the capacity to be on the side of good are you all ball I like flex and I

18:52.400 --> 18:59.120
show off my tight pants and I'm like hell no man have you always been ball when you were first John

18:59.120 --> 19:05.120
was that ball did I only ever know a ball I think I was a ball you were bald in I think so why don't

19:05.120 --> 19:09.200
you remember if you were ball you'd be a ball you know you were a ball well hey man being a ball

19:09.200 --> 19:19.280
just feels like being you or me so you're I could be ball yeah that's what I I really don't know

19:19.280 --> 19:25.760
who's ball and who's not but a lot of us could be ball honestly Keith vigna is just looking but in

19:25.760 --> 19:33.680
between these two having just no almost no clue what's going well you see Keith I'm a ball I'm

19:33.680 --> 19:39.040
just like kind of nodding my head like I think I might be ball to my ball I don't I don't know I

19:39.040 --> 19:44.160
might be ball I don't think I'm ball I don't hold on hold on hold on hold on all right I want you

19:44.160 --> 19:48.440
all just turn around and I'm gonna give you a little John Lee petty more patented neck rub and

19:48.440 --> 19:53.800
we're gonna see if I feel anything weird in that spot of yours what if you ball me what if I don't

19:53.800 --> 19:59.040
what if I'm not balling you ball me I promise not to follow you just let me give you a little neck

19:59.040 --> 20:06.760
rip and then John Lee petty more gets in there and he's like god damn it's good it's firm but

20:06.760 --> 20:14.360
sensitive it's for the first time in days your attention leaves Clark's shoulders I'm following

20:14.360 --> 20:22.520
your muscles and your bones perfectly and it's just like fuck you feel like a dog basically a

20:22.640 --> 20:30.440
regular John Peters the best pet of its life and after I'm done I'm like well I'm no anatomy

20:30.440 --> 20:38.560
expert but John Lee petty more is a back rub expert and I don't see any signs of ball from

20:38.560 --> 20:42.840
that I have no idea how that presents in the anatomy what I've seen but thank you for letting

20:42.840 --> 20:47.400
me lay on hands it's been in the head it's been in the skull us I sinked it in you and I saw it

20:47.400 --> 20:53.560
having a rosemary where you saw a ball and rosemary so in the office previous when things were bad

20:53.560 --> 21:00.960
rosemary made a move for the gun the tube gun on the desk of Marvin in his office I don't know what

21:00.960 --> 21:06.040
her plan was but Marvin wait a minute rosemary turned against Marvin at the last minute and

21:06.040 --> 21:11.560
Marvin flung one of those silver balls at her oh buddy I think I know why wait what happened okay

21:11.560 --> 21:16.280
hold on what happened when he threw the silver ball crack cracked her open and took her spine

21:16.280 --> 21:21.680
out and replaced it he threw the ball at her through the ball at her and it popped her open

21:21.680 --> 21:27.480
like a can of soda and ripped out her spine and replaced it dang oh yeah then the ball the silver

21:27.480 --> 21:33.000
ball now inhabiting rosemary as far as I know pulled the trigger and she disappeared did we

21:33.000 --> 21:38.760
see rosemary as one of the corpses that came out of the the booth or whatever it was no no okay no

21:38.760 --> 21:43.840
I didn't think so yeah all right so rosemary she was in love with Marvin's dog son yeah she was

21:43.840 --> 21:49.120
trying to find his son the one who got gun by Tilly Marvin didn't really care but that's why

21:49.120 --> 21:54.480
she wanted the gun Jermaine glass was she in one in love with the one who got evaporated to the

21:54.480 --> 21:58.320
one who was turned into a fool the one who got evaporated yeah so she was trying to get that

21:58.320 --> 22:03.840
gun to find him to get him back that's what I know about rose well I was confused at the time

22:03.840 --> 22:08.360
and I still am about the whole business of her making a move at Marvin Marvin throwing the ball

22:08.360 --> 22:12.440
at her like that would do like he knew it would do something but then it I don't know if it did

22:12.480 --> 22:16.720
the thing he thought it was gonna do like she pulled the trigger either way based on all those

22:16.720 --> 22:21.800
videos I saw Marvin knew what those balls would do Marvin does know what those balls would do and I

22:21.800 --> 22:28.480
think he's creating or controlling them in some capacity when I was playing at juggernaut I mean

22:28.480 --> 22:39.800
I became that from being a ball I rolled into into him and well what John Lee Pennymore sighs

22:39.880 --> 22:49.760
a sweet nostalgic sigh he's back in his in a human body but he feels like he should be in a gigantic

22:49.760 --> 22:58.080
metal sphere I was gonna call for a sanity check but it doesn't seem to fit your wistful not not

22:58.080 --> 23:05.680
upset well guys I know that we just I know we just got tasked to kill Robin but before we do you do

23:05.680 --> 23:10.200
you think he might know something about this oh I mean well yeah who knows we should definitely

23:10.200 --> 23:16.520
interrogate anybody before we murder them but I so far I haven't seen any reason not to trust Maggie

23:16.520 --> 23:20.320
not to murder again I mean I have but I she kind of she kind of addressed it well do you think we

23:20.320 --> 23:25.720
should go to his house or to the wood to talk to bark or I'd lean toward going to his house

23:25.720 --> 23:30.040
and just seeing what kind of personal files he's got do you have his number or maybe like that is

23:30.280 --> 23:40.680
mom's number his mom is dead oh and don't ask me how I know that how do you know that I killed her

23:40.680 --> 23:48.840
we'll get to that later what no I yeah I didn't kill my brother I you know what I'll just tell

23:48.840 --> 23:54.760
you the story I convinced her to kill my brother and then I killed her so she couldn't tell on me

23:54.760 --> 24:01.760
hold and there you have it let's let's let's you know what we'll cop we'll get to that no way

24:01.760 --> 24:07.960
probably never again let's just never talk about it all cops are bastards me too I don't really

24:07.960 --> 24:14.160
identify as a cop anymore really but uh what what why did you by proxy kill your brother

24:14.160 --> 24:25.520
for money which I never ended up seeing you know the more I think about it the more I'm glad we

24:25.520 --> 24:31.600
aren't cops anymore fellas you've all done some pretty you want to go sleep we can still use our

24:31.600 --> 24:39.080
investigative skills sell some drugs that I found in the course of an investigation that's to a man

24:39.120 --> 24:45.600
with children that is routine cop work I think a lot of drug dealers have kids they don't employ

24:45.600 --> 24:55.440
a lot of kids I think a lot of drug dealers are kids you guys want to go sneak around his

24:55.440 --> 25:01.120
house and see what we can find yeah I think we should do his house it's insert time here

25:01.120 --> 25:08.360
he's probably not at home it's roughly 2 p.m. on December 6th which is a Saturday I guess

25:08.360 --> 25:12.880
fuck he could be home or he's out partying I mean if it's home that's I mean it's a little early

25:12.880 --> 25:18.000
honestly 2 p.m. at a Saturday is exactly when he would be home that's it that's fine though I mean

25:18.000 --> 25:25.960
let's go it's yeah yeah we also our police still kind of we have badges I never left I've always

25:25.960 --> 25:31.160
considered myself a cop of contention well let's go whether I be drug dealer or a giant metal ball

25:31.160 --> 25:36.240
man I've been looking out for the people back home does he live in the city or yeah you're in

25:36.240 --> 25:40.800
the city now boys does he live here she lives downtown perfect we don't have jurisdiction so

25:40.800 --> 25:48.760
we can obviously commit an extra judicial killing without any paperwork yeah well at least less

25:48.760 --> 25:57.920
paperwork I mean for us I mean let's go see what we could find out then yeah some smug city cop

25:57.920 --> 26:03.280
looking down on the small town fuzz you guys want to take my car the only one they're hopping I get

26:03.280 --> 26:12.560
in you hop into Clark's silver Honda Accord Honda make your dreams drive is this the Accord sport

26:12.560 --> 26:18.960
it's a exhale II exactly Maggie gave it to me I don't know what we're in here and you guys take

26:18.960 --> 26:26.480
off downtown to a two-story brownstone in the city when you arrive you find parking decently nearby

26:26.480 --> 26:31.800
actually go ahead and roll for parking no I don't give a shit so you guys show up well I crit failed

26:31.800 --> 26:39.840
and you find the number on the door is 218 but probably more important than that is that there

26:39.840 --> 26:47.400
is police tape over the door are there any cars in the park the driveway not a driveway no driveway

26:47.400 --> 26:54.160
for this brownstone here is it a home like a row or a large brick row house well there's other ones

26:54.160 --> 26:58.960
that look just like it on the other side and it's really nice it's like a very very nice street that

26:58.960 --> 27:04.280
you're on there's a park across the street well if I learned anything as a cop it's that this do

27:04.280 --> 27:11.120
not cross tape is not very strong and I rip it and I think if you'd learned anything it as a cop

27:11.120 --> 27:16.920
it's that do not cross does not apply to you that's true and I jiggle the handle of the door

27:16.920 --> 27:24.960
I kind of put the tape back so no one follows this you like tie it together yeah yeah title

27:24.960 --> 27:35.920
not in it good as new is the door unlocked ha the door is unlocked nice I rolled an 88 for the

27:35.920 --> 27:43.120
yeah who was there last to remember to lock the door yeah I walk on it was a real kid's a big

27:43.120 --> 27:53.200
night surprise yourself with that role you're like of course not why would it be unlocked yeah when

27:53.200 --> 27:58.560
you guys walk in the stench is the first thing you notice like a dead body would any of you have

27:58.560 --> 28:04.000
been in a heroin den working in the contention PD probably not in contention probably not like

28:04.000 --> 28:09.360
you do you know what it smells like I know what a meth house smells like I've been in one of those

28:09.360 --> 28:15.400
and it's bad it's like poop and cigarettes it smells like poop and cigarettes and heroin hmm

28:15.400 --> 28:22.280
it is a fucking wreck there's trash everywhere most of the furnishings that should be here are

28:22.280 --> 28:28.720
gone there's like pallets made all over the place but there's actual human fecal matter just like

28:28.720 --> 28:34.040
strewn about seems that people were like stepping in it and tracking it all around the place smells

28:34.040 --> 28:42.040
like piss spray-painted on one of the walls Heisenberg is eight one one eight one eight nine

28:42.040 --> 28:51.680
five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine got it did you really I started writing

28:51.680 --> 28:57.400
about midway I'd lost it does that have any significance to us it's on the wall is that

28:57.400 --> 29:07.560
we said spray-painted roll again for me signals intelligence I have a zero so no don't roll

29:07.560 --> 29:13.760
signals for me so no none of you would be able to I'm gonna put anything together I'm gonna take a

29:13.760 --> 29:24.960
picture of it so we have it for later nice so what is it eight one etc etc and go ahead in first just

29:24.960 --> 29:28.920
tell me what you guys are doing when you are in here like I'm just looking around for anything

29:28.920 --> 29:34.400
that isn't just gross anything that sticks out that's not you know drugged in ask Clark is

29:34.400 --> 29:41.640
saying hello you hear nothing except for your partners rifling through all this shit it seems

29:41.640 --> 29:49.280
that everything that would have been in a place this nice is long gone drawers have been pulled

29:49.280 --> 29:56.480
out of cabinets and doors are open everywhere everything is just strewn about and everything

29:56.480 --> 30:02.360
that was once clean is no longer or not here anymore since this is such a nice place are there

30:02.360 --> 30:12.320
any security cameras around in the house roll luck of fail no not a crit fail just to fail okay

30:12.320 --> 30:18.560
I'd like to run up to the next floor and see if it's as decrepit and heroin II and shitty when you

30:18.560 --> 30:24.320
get up to the second floor the hair on the back of your neck stands up and I roll an alertness

30:24.320 --> 30:33.800
or a search you can roll search for me 19 and as your grit fail okay as you're walking through

30:33.800 --> 30:42.400
the hallway you see there's a few rooms up here in a bathroom and there's just this heavy presence

30:42.400 --> 30:50.240
that you've never felt before and carved into the walls in this room that is maybe had been

30:50.240 --> 30:56.240
an office at one point in time is the same set of numbers that you saw spray-painted downstairs

30:56.240 --> 31:04.960
eight one one eight one eight nine five two zero one three one one eight one one one nine and it

31:04.960 --> 31:13.080
is carved over and over and over on everything in here using a simple substitution cipher with

31:13.080 --> 31:19.000
you know one equaling a and so on do I get any new words out of this do I take a break and give

31:19.000 --> 31:35.640
it a go fuck no just tell me yes but just I mean it's like ha ha ha ha no okay obviously that

31:35.640 --> 31:41.160
wouldn't so I actually I'd be down to spend a few minutes looking at it I don't know we might find

31:41.160 --> 31:45.880
fun stuff off mic though but we can bring it back I don't know take a hot piss and let's see if we

31:45.880 --> 32:06.040
can figure it out off mic so did you guys figure it out yeah it's pretty obvious yeah I mean it's

32:06.040 --> 32:10.400
it's very elementary once you get right into it so we can probably just breeze through that

32:11.360 --> 32:19.200
listeners have it by now anything else in this room besides carvings on the wall besides the

32:19.200 --> 32:26.640
obvious thing the painful easy cipher the really easy one that we figured out for sure no are there

32:26.640 --> 32:30.480
any like closets or doors or anything did he leave a note saying where he went some of the

32:30.480 --> 32:36.520
doors have even been taken off and the closet doors are all open and it's the same situation

32:36.840 --> 32:43.080
and garbage yeah can I look in the bedroom and tell I don't know if it looks like it's been used

32:43.080 --> 32:48.120
recently I'm trying to get a gauge of how long it's been like in this state it looks like what

32:48.120 --> 32:53.080
could be like the master bedroom or at least the bedroom one of the bedrooms upstairs that's large

32:53.080 --> 33:01.560
and has a bathroom attached the bed is gone the bed frame is gone and there are pallets all over

33:01.560 --> 33:05.720
the place like there have been like 20 people sleeping right here can I look in the fridge

33:05.720 --> 33:12.800
or the kitchen see what I glean from the kitchen when you go through the fridge it is sparse there

33:12.800 --> 33:21.160
is like some rotten food but then there's also like some takeout a lot of like fast food that's

33:21.160 --> 33:27.320
been like half eaten and stuff I want to call the city PD not like the normal number but like the

33:27.480 --> 33:32.360
fellow cop number sure calling an office and basically I want to say like yeah this is John

33:32.360 --> 33:38.360
Lee Pettymore out of contention we got a case about a drifter who might have committed some

33:38.360 --> 33:42.760
property crimes down here and we might have tracked him to a drug hideout up there in the

33:42.760 --> 33:48.760
city y'all had some police tape up around it so we didn't go inside but I was of course wondering

33:49.560 --> 33:54.360
whatever information you had on that if you could get it to me about who was living there how long

33:54.360 --> 34:00.360
it had been in that state as a drug squat whether or not the owner of the residence was participating

34:00.360 --> 34:10.600
in in that squat oh yeah sure oh that's 501 east fake street so it's 218 is the address okay and

34:12.120 --> 34:15.800
I said it wasn't as important as the police tape over the door that doesn't mean it's not important

34:15.800 --> 34:25.320
oh 218 yeah that's Bruce Robin's home and uh he dipped out of there a few days ago seemingly and

34:25.320 --> 34:32.280
we questioned some of the neighbors and they said that he was going absolutely crazy he was not

34:32.280 --> 34:38.760
acting like himself and he was uh had just people coming in at all time of the day and night and

34:38.760 --> 34:46.200
just inviting them all in and and then he just disappeared probably two days ago and they haven't

34:46.200 --> 34:51.000
seen him since so the squat was was established already there were there were all kinds of

34:51.000 --> 34:56.920
unstable characters coming around while Mr. Robin was still in residence seemingly for a short

34:56.920 --> 35:03.320
amount of time but I you don't want to go in there it is absolutely disgusting they did a number on

35:03.320 --> 35:09.240
that place in such a short amount of time I mean it was truly horrific stuff did y'all have any

35:09.240 --> 35:15.720
leads uh about where Mr. Robin went we might want to interview him about our subject honestly you

35:15.720 --> 35:21.640
know he's a high profile member of the community and we're just kind of putting it on the back

35:21.640 --> 35:28.440
burner I understand uh you know cops exist to protect the capitalist superstructure under which

35:28.440 --> 35:35.800
we we uh we serve so that's you're doing your job we looked into it and his mother died recently

35:35.800 --> 35:43.240
and uh she hey now that's the lead his business partner is also dead oh god tragic so he seems

35:43.240 --> 35:48.360
to have been going through some stuff and if you know mental illness is a serious issue here in

35:48.360 --> 35:54.840
the city and really all over the world and no no no I mean not in contention we just uh we just uh

35:54.840 --> 36:00.760
if you're not acting normal you know we either send you to a lot of church or we make you feel

36:00.760 --> 36:07.800
alienated until you just leave or kill yourself it's the it's the small town way jesus christ

36:09.480 --> 36:12.280
yeah his voice changes and he says jesus christ

36:13.400 --> 36:17.800
keith can only hear one side of this conversation I'm like what the fuck

36:18.760 --> 36:24.440
I was just like I'm just telling them about small town life well well shit but what's

36:24.440 --> 36:29.640
our next step we came real close to doing it to you when you first came to the department I tell you

36:34.200 --> 36:38.600
would you have sent keith vigna to church or would you have alienated him we tried to send the

36:38.600 --> 36:44.680
boy to church we tried he didn't seem to get along too well with the pastor no one saw him show up

36:44.680 --> 36:51.560
yeah I did like uh the all-you-can-eat buffets they had yeah I remember how you took advantage

36:51.560 --> 36:57.400
of the lord's hospitality we got to find this guy he's obviously not here should we I mean go

36:57.400 --> 37:01.960
to bar corp do you fellas think it's worth talking to the neighbors ourselves I was thinking about it

37:01.960 --> 37:10.040
but if I mean since we're here I guess roll search whoever has the best search roll search for me I

37:10.040 --> 37:19.160
ain't got it I got the baseline 20 I've got a 50 yeah yeah I have 40 so 76 all right yeah then uh

37:19.160 --> 37:24.120
making a final pass through the home favorite uh you accidentally step in a pile of piss

37:25.320 --> 37:32.200
you know how piss piles it's a huge stack of piss watch out for that stack of piss

37:32.440 --> 37:41.080
hot piss no it's cold it's coagulated at this point gross it's not so uh I guess do you want

37:41.080 --> 37:44.760
to go knock on a neighbor's door or are you Phil is thinking what I'm thinking as far as

37:45.800 --> 37:51.480
what are you what do you think well we know about a bunch of people being destitute that's kind of

37:51.480 --> 37:55.640
a thing we learned oh yeah we learned that Kathy was kind of running homeless people around at

37:55.640 --> 38:01.080
various folks yeah but they weren't so much the heroin living their own shit kind of destitute

38:01.080 --> 38:05.160
was it well they didn't smell good I think that was one thing that Keith confirmed for I mean I

38:05.160 --> 38:09.560
was on a bus full of four of them and but you're right they weren't necessarily it was not a good

38:09.560 --> 38:15.160
smell they weren't necessarily drug does Keith remember the smell does Keith recognize the smell

38:15.160 --> 38:19.800
of the bus yeah could any of them have come out of the squat or is it into smell is one of the

38:19.800 --> 38:27.640
strongest uh you know memory senses Keith vigna give me a smell roll you've been doing a fair

38:27.640 --> 38:35.960
amount of cocaine the past few days give me a luck roll I got a six oh no a nine but still

38:37.080 --> 38:43.240
that's lower than what my luck is this is a different smell okay I do one last big breath

38:43.240 --> 38:49.640
in I'm like definitely not the bus uh homeless bus smell I trust your smells hey y'all I mean

38:49.640 --> 38:54.680
why don't we just call him call robin call robin you could be like do we have his phone number in

38:54.680 --> 38:59.560
that envelope you would have his direct number yeah it's not a bad idea Keith could call him

38:59.560 --> 39:03.880
just checking in about his brother yeah as far as you know you don't know anything or and wanting

39:03.880 --> 39:10.840
to commiserate about the mother yeah he lost his mother Keith lost his brother uh yeah have you met

39:10.840 --> 39:16.760
robin no I haven't but uh you know we're both aware of each other you know I'd give him a call

39:16.760 --> 39:21.400
you would hope a call from a good Samaritan a time of need would you both have something to relate to

39:21.400 --> 39:26.120
it it could play yeah I give it I'll ring him you want to put that on speakerphone for us I do

39:26.120 --> 39:33.080
obviously after we step out of this hell hole okay so back in the car I assume sure are you

39:33.080 --> 39:37.080
guys just standing on the street should we walk around the block before we get back in the car

39:38.280 --> 39:43.400
get the smell off just because of the smell oh yeah I thought you meant for more investigating

39:43.400 --> 39:48.440
which is also an idea talk to the neighbors but uh I mean let's make the call in the privacy of

39:48.440 --> 39:53.800
the car but we don't have to leave beep boop boop as you guys are walking back to the car

39:53.800 --> 40:00.200
just a reminder of what the city looks like flowers everywhere oh yeah it's different than

40:00.200 --> 40:07.640
contention uh the filter sickly green on the coloration yeah sickly green tint with heavy

40:07.640 --> 40:13.640
grays the streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids and there's a scent in the air like

40:13.640 --> 40:19.160
someone left out cheese and a colostomy bag on every corner the faces of the buildings are

40:19.160 --> 40:25.960
slathered in billboards and the faces of the people bumbling about are bloated and lifeless

40:25.960 --> 40:32.440
in a strange opposition to all this depressive scenery there are beautiful flowers in every shade

40:32.440 --> 40:38.200
and shape growing in every otherwise empty alleyway and out of many cracks in the sidewalks

40:38.200 --> 40:44.040
and roads I want to find the most lifeless looking person passing and I want to tap them

40:44.040 --> 40:51.000
on the shoulder sorry why are you so pallid and corpse lack oh work's been pretty hard recently

40:51.000 --> 40:56.200
I guess where do you work the corp uh bar corp yeah they gave us some days off though which is

40:56.200 --> 41:01.640
nice so I think I've got a little bit more color to my cheeks than I did recently oh they're

41:01.640 --> 41:07.240
positively rosy they're paying us time and a half to take like two weeks off two weeks off for a

41:07.240 --> 41:12.920
whole massive corporation like that yeah it's crazy right why I don't know something about the

41:12.920 --> 41:20.840
new takeover uh our new CEO Bruce Robin he's uh he's doing like some cool stuff he's like trying

41:20.840 --> 41:27.000
to renovate everything apparently he's gonna make everyone have livable wage and benefits that are

41:27.000 --> 41:33.320
realistically priced for all workers uh I guess we're getting better hours and yeah he's renovating

41:33.320 --> 41:38.920
all the facilities to be up to code so we're all getting paid during the time off time and a half

41:38.920 --> 41:43.720
but we could actually get even more if we help with the renovations do you know where he's

41:43.720 --> 41:48.600
overseeing these renovations no I think he's just at the office but that's just an assumption he

41:48.600 --> 41:53.720
doesn't come out to the sites very often sir what do you what do you do for bar corp in particular

41:53.720 --> 42:00.680

42:00.680 --> 42:09.000

42:20.120 --> 42:26.040
uh rosemary if those flowers were always there can you remind me if you said yes or no whether they

42:26.040 --> 42:30.280
were a new thing to the city or if it's always been that way petty more asked rosemary if the

42:30.280 --> 42:37.160
city is always this floral and she said yeah okay hey Keith what's what's barcorp do what what is

43:03.000 --> 43:08.440
just some comes in some goes out more comes in than than goes out though I think because they're

43:08.440 --> 43:13.560

45:21.440 --> 45:27.200
totally and then I want to call yeah I want to call Ferguson's office number and try to talk to

45:27.200 --> 45:38.120
his secretary Winifred Worth's office hey this is Ferguson beans I'm not dead no sorry you're the

45:38.120 --> 45:43.440
same gentleman Keith beans you just called your Ferguson's brother why did you say that no I'm

45:43.440 --> 45:50.000
Ferguson and she is old it sounds like so she doesn't remember what Ferguson sounds like he's

45:50.000 --> 45:59.440
my brother we sound very similar I'm whip-crack smart and you sound like an idiot now is this

45:59.440 --> 46:10.400
some sort of prank on Bruce tell the DM what's going on I try what I really liked was when we

46:10.400 --> 46:16.080
played with a different DM this past weekend who was not Zach and you tried and he was just like

46:20.640 --> 46:26.520
I hang up I hang up I'm like damn I thought that would definitely work

46:26.520 --> 46:33.400
Winifred Worth is good at her job she fucking keeps it locked down we found out where Bruce

46:33.400 --> 46:38.280
is I mean he's there right now we could I mean once we get up to the 17th floor and bust in with

46:38.280 --> 46:43.520
some fucking cop uniforms on you know some yeah some uh she doesn't know what I look like breakers

46:43.520 --> 46:47.680
with some initials on the back yeah if we just go up there it's just police business I mean there's

46:47.680 --> 46:52.600
no reason they can't stop yeah I mean I would like to see Winifred Worth try to stop us after

46:52.600 --> 46:56.920
hearing that phone call on speaker we were just talking to that fella and it sounds like Bruce

46:56.920 --> 47:02.440
is maybe doing some good for this city as well that's what they told the workers that's true

47:02.440 --> 47:08.880
maybe things has changed nothing going on in this city that was good so I'll believe it when I see

47:08.880 --> 47:13.760
it but I say we go try to confront him see what we can get out of him then his business partner

47:13.760 --> 47:18.280
was a man who bought cocaine in a van full of children how do we think that Robin is any better

47:18.280 --> 47:23.080
but according to this guy it's because he's now CEO he said a bunch of changes were coming and

47:23.080 --> 47:28.760
that they were positive all I mean is that he's the kind of guy who got into business with Ferguson

47:28.760 --> 47:34.200
in the first place and is his heart that full of gold and someone that we trust wants us to kill

47:34.200 --> 47:40.800
him yeah you're right we gotta I say we go I say we go I mean we go talk to him if we if we find

47:40.800 --> 47:45.240
out some better information we could change her mind but I trust her that she's telling us these

47:45.240 --> 47:50.040
things will stop this thing so I'm gonna do these things to stop the thing I don't know yeah I don't

47:50.040 --> 47:55.160
know if I do trust this new well it was pretty cool I'll she faked her own death that was right

47:55.160 --> 48:00.440
I mean I said earlier if you if you trust her I trust you not to mention the circle of knowledge

48:00.440 --> 48:06.560
is what I've gleaned so far has been around for a while and seems to have been doing good being

48:06.560 --> 48:12.560
keeping keeping with this awful thing was at bay let's go talk to Bruce just get some info yeah

48:12.560 --> 48:15.680
maybe find out what other stuff the circle in the lodge has been up to

48:36.560 --> 48:40.000
the only one trying to
