00:00.000 --> 00:03.300
Welcome to the Bone Zone, my babies!

00:03.300 --> 00:06.500
It's your sexual guru, Walt the Dog,

00:06.500 --> 00:14.300
and I'm here to make sweet love to the radio airwaves live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:14.300 --> 00:21.200
Contentions' naughtiest radio station for hot Christian singles in your area.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.700
I'm starting to have those weird dreams again, y'all.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.200
The newest batch was wild.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.700
I went to the coffee shop in my dreamland

00:30.700 --> 00:35.100
and proceeded to ask for the oldest and stankiest grounds,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.800
as is my custom.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.500
The coffee attendant denied me my rightful treasures,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.200
so I started shaking them violently.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.600
The head fell off,

00:44.600 --> 00:49.300
and 42 snakes erupted from the hole where the head once was.

00:49.300 --> 00:54.500
The snakes all started chanting in unison and calling me The Reginald.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.100
I cried, but instead of tears,

00:57.100 --> 01:01.200
little tiny baby wolf started pouring out my damn eyes.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.000
All the baby wolf started doing a dance

01:04.000 --> 01:06.800
and raised me up to the damn heavens,

01:06.800 --> 01:10.300
where I proceeded to become a god.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.300
And then my teeth fell out and I had sex with my dad.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.000
Wait, who is my dad?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.800
W-was I even birthed?

01:16.800 --> 01:19.300
If you can interpret anything from these,

01:19.300 --> 01:21.900
please reach out and be my Joseph.

01:21.900 --> 01:25.600
You know your Wolfie loves a coat of many colors.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.700
Seriously, what do these dreams mean?

01:28.700 --> 01:32.600
Tell me at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram,

01:32.600 --> 01:36.300
or tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, why don't you?

01:36.300 --> 01:40.100
Or how about you write us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts

01:40.100 --> 01:43.200
with your analysis of my fancies.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.400
And maybe I'll read it on the show,

01:45.400 --> 01:50.200
like I'm now about to read this five-star review from Ram Oden.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.300
They write,

01:51.300 --> 01:54.700
Flat Earthers believe that we live on a cosmic Frisbee

01:54.700 --> 01:57.200
that God threw at the beginning of time.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.700
I assume Wolf the dog will be there to catch us at the end.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.200
Much love, y'all are delightful.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.400
Thank you so much for putting this out.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.800
I listen to dozens of podcasts and this is one of two

02:08.800 --> 02:12.100
that puts the numbers in me on a weekly basis.

02:12.100 --> 02:14.200
I don't get to play as much as I'd like,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.100
responsibilities and all,

02:16.100 --> 02:19.100
but I'll be handling for the first time this weekend

02:19.100 --> 02:21.700
and you've inspired me to move ahead with it.

02:21.700 --> 02:25.700
Also, we'll be introducing the luck mechanic mashup

02:25.700 --> 02:29.600
into standard Delta Green for a bit more pulp.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.100
I will say again,

02:31.100 --> 02:34.200
I do not know what the fucking internet is

02:34.200 --> 02:36.700
or what the fuck a podcast is,

02:36.700 --> 02:41.000
but I definitely know when someone's being a sweetie to me.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.700
Thank you, Ram Oden.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.100
I hope whatever it is you're doing is fun as hell.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.400
Speaking of fun as hell stuff

02:48.400 --> 02:50.600
and things that are on the internet,

02:50.600 --> 02:53.300

03:12.300 --> 03:14.800

03:39.600 --> 03:43.800
of Zach running the boys through Carla Cthulhu's The Haunting.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.200
And for patrons in the Denison,

03:46.200 --> 03:47.600
we will be live streaming

03:47.600 --> 03:49.800
the behind the scenes recording process

03:49.800 --> 03:53.700
for part two of Lover in the Ice on Tuesday,

03:53.700 --> 03:57.200
May 26th at 6 p.m. Central Time.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.200
You thought the Denison at Glasses Compound was gross.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.800
Come watch our dumb faces while we play

04:03.800 --> 04:07.600
the filthiest scenario Delta Green has to offer.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.900
Something, something, something.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.400
It's time for the news.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.600
Turns out Drew wasn't Drew.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.700
Some of y'all were paying attention.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.300
Councilwoman Carrie pages in the body

04:18.300 --> 04:21.300
of Drew Andrews was handcuffed, ankle cuffed

04:21.300 --> 04:24.100
and tossed in the trunk of the red Mitsubishi

04:24.100 --> 04:26.000
where she still resides.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.300
But the car is hidden off the side

04:28.300 --> 04:31.800
of the highway on the outskirts of contention.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.600
These dumb ass ex cops were keen enough eyesight wise

04:35.600 --> 04:37.900
to spot some sort of entry checkpoint

04:37.900 --> 04:39.900
at contention's only exit.

04:39.900 --> 04:43.800
Keith Vigna snuck past a growing grazing gazer

04:43.800 --> 04:47.200
sitting in a dunk tank in the parking lot

04:47.200 --> 04:51.200
of Hotel Motel just watching for something.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.500
But he completely missed Keith Vigna making his way

04:54.500 --> 04:57.200
back to the gang with his treasured McGuffin,

04:57.200 --> 04:58.800
his father's watch.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.400
The whole rest of the episode was these goobers

05:01.400 --> 05:03.900
taking turns wearing this cursed object

05:03.900 --> 05:05.700
and seeing visions.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.400
Well, gear up for more of that.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.100
Then strap down and throw your hands in the air

05:13.100 --> 05:16.500
because it's time for Kudzu with No Backbone.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.500
["No Backbone, No Backbone, No Backbone"]

05:46.700 --> 05:48.900
Hello, all you wolf pups out there,

05:48.900 --> 05:52.700
listeners of this show here on 694.2 PTBP.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.900
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

05:54.900 --> 05:58.700
I am your handler, your keeper, your GM, your narrator,

05:58.700 --> 06:01.500
your idiot god, Zach.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.500
Thankfully, I am joined today by three of my dearest friends

06:04.500 --> 06:06.900
and three of your dearest player characters.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.200
That's right.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.000
I've got the contention police officers here.

06:11.000 --> 06:11.900
What up?

06:11.900 --> 06:12.700
Yeah, yeah.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.000
That's it.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.500
Thanks for hanging out.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
It's been Pretending to Be People.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.200
See you next episode.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.000
Like and subscribe.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.700
It's just like not a lot's going on right now, so.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, sign up for the Patreon.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
No, I mean, what people like about this podcast

06:31.000 --> 06:33.100
is that you get to read between the lines

06:33.100 --> 06:35.000
and kind of draw your own picture.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.400
So this was really a fan service episode.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.500
Giving the people what they want.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.700
It was a little, you know, it's a little over the top,

06:44.700 --> 06:48.800
a little cheesy, but I think the true PTBP fans

06:48.800 --> 06:51.300
are going to love what they just heard.

06:51.300 --> 06:51.800
Yeah.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.300
We're out.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.300
That was episode 79 or 8, whichever one.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.000
Thanks, guys.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Thanks for listening.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.500
79.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.700
We are in 79 now.

07:00.700 --> 07:01.200
Hey.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.300
That's more than I thought we were going to do by like 50.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.600
Yeah.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.200
Yeah.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.100
I'm still having fun, though.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.100
I've been looking forward to it all day.

07:13.100 --> 07:13.700
Ditto.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.300
All day.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.800
If looking forward to it means nervous and scared

07:17.800 --> 07:19.500
the whole time, then yes, I have been

07:19.500 --> 07:21.200
looking forward to it all day.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
We'll be fine.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.200
I think everything's going to work out great.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.000
If you want, we could just take it from here.

07:28.000 --> 07:28.500
Oh, yeah.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.900
If you could, I'd love to see that happen.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.400
Yeah.

07:31.400 --> 07:31.900
Cool.

07:31.900 --> 07:36.500
So guys, you're standing in front of the Goo God.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.000
Sure.

07:37.000 --> 07:37.500
OK.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.600
It's actually pronounced Gew God.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.300
Yeah, we're not trying to get fancy here.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.100
Also, this isn't your job anymore.

07:44.100 --> 07:44.600
Oh, shit.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.400
Sorry.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.000
Kick him out.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
So what you've deduced is that you just have

07:48.000 --> 07:50.700
to hurt its feelings, and you win.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.500
So if you can say something really hurtful about this Goo.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.300
You're just dang old jiggly is all you are.

07:57.300 --> 08:01.700
Oh, the monster screams in pain.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.700
Hey, Goo, people think that you and I would get along really

08:04.700 --> 08:05.200
well.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.200
Whoa, no.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.800
No.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.500
I'm a loner.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.300
It's working.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.100
It's working, guys.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.600
It looks like what else do you have?

08:17.600 --> 08:21.700
Hey, Goo, this new fella I met over here

08:21.700 --> 08:23.200
says that we look like brothers.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.100
Oh, that's not bad.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.400
He has a crush on you.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.000
Yeah, the Goo apparently thinks Drew is not bad looking, so.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.400
OK, let's actually start.

08:38.400 --> 08:42.000
You guys are really close to winning.

08:42.000 --> 08:42.700
I shoot it.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.200
So we ended the last episode with all three of you

08:45.200 --> 08:50.100
taking turns, putting on this watch, and seeing a vision,

08:50.100 --> 08:52.300
and then the watch slipping off, and then putting it

08:52.300 --> 08:53.300
right on somebody else.

08:53.300 --> 08:57.100
I believe John Lee, Kevin Moore III just slapped it

08:57.100 --> 08:58.400
right on Clark Bishop.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.900
And then they were questioning John Lee.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.200
Pettymore was like, if I put it on again, will it be the same?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.300
But he asked it to the sky or something.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.500
And then Keith Wigner was like, well, I'll just do it.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.900
And so Keith Wigner slapped on the watch.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.600
His eyes come back to reality as the watch slips off

09:16.600 --> 09:17.800
into his other hand.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.100
He won't give up that easy.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.500
It took me so long to catch what you said.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.200
I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.300
That's a DC Talk lyric.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.700
So just a lot of rap, this one, just a lot of rap

09:32.700 --> 09:34.000
lyrics on this one for sure.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.100
So Keith Wigner's got the watch, the throne,

09:37.100 --> 09:42.300
and I need everyone to roll sanity with your dice.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.600
Even me?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.100
All of yas.

09:46.100 --> 09:50.500
It's a 0 slash 1 sanity check.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.100
2.

09:51.100 --> 09:56.900
I got a 30, which means I don't pass.

09:56.900 --> 09:57.700
I rolled a 2.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.100
30 on a 15.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.700
I failed a 68 on a 16.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.600
And 68, what's that look like on your power there?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.500
Yeah, it's above my power.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.500
Well, let's see what happens literally right now

10:09.500 --> 10:12.200
as you lose one sanity, as does Keith Wigner.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.600
Keith Wigner, when this watch pops off,

10:14.600 --> 10:17.400
you just let out a little scream, which

10:17.400 --> 10:23.900
you realize in this moment is the only noise

10:23.900 --> 10:25.700
that you can hear because contention

10:25.700 --> 10:29.700
is wildly quiet compared to the last time you were here.

10:29.700 --> 10:33.100
If you'll remember, last time you heard lots of animals

10:33.100 --> 10:35.700
in the creek and in the ponds and such,

10:35.700 --> 10:38.800
and you can't hear that right now.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.900
All you're hearing is just this, ah, from Keith Wigner

10:41.900 --> 10:43.400
that is echoing.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.200
And then you think it might even bounce off

10:46.200 --> 10:50.600
of that big floating moat and bounce back at you.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.000
It's echoing through contention.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.200
And Clark Bishop.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.100
He sees Keith put that watch on and then take it off, right?

10:58.100 --> 11:00.400
That's where we're standing right now.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.800
I'm going to try and tackle Keith, and I'm yelling,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.200
why would you put it on again?

11:06.200 --> 11:08.100
Why would you put it on again?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.500
Keith, are you trying to put up a little resistance there?

11:10.500 --> 11:13.400
Yeah, I'm going to try to just get out of his way.

11:13.400 --> 11:13.900
OK.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.200
I'm going to, yeah, and I'm going to try to help Keith.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.400
All right, so you can roll to assist,

11:19.400 --> 11:22.500
and it'll give Keith a plus 20 on his roll.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
What should I roll on?

11:23.500 --> 11:26.900
Dexterity or unarmed combat or athletics,

11:26.900 --> 11:30.300
whichever one's highest.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.500
Doesn't fail them all, 76.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.800
So what am I rolling?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.500
You're going to roll dodge to get out

11:35.500 --> 11:40.400
of the way against Clark Bishop's unarmed combat.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.900
60 on a 30.

11:43.900 --> 11:47.000
I rolled a 61 on a 70.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I beat you by one, right?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.100
I still failed.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.000
Oh, I got you.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Clark, you can do whatever you want,

11:53.000 --> 11:58.200
but John Lee Pettymore tries to grab on to Keith Vigna

11:58.200 --> 12:02.600
to pull him out of the way and just literally just grab shirt.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.300
You're still wearing the massive polo, I believe?

12:05.300 --> 12:08.100
No, way too big cargo shorts.

12:08.100 --> 12:08.800
Oh, super tight.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.100
The polo's a little too small.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.500
Yeah, and so as you grab his shirt,

12:13.500 --> 12:16.300
it's so tight on his skin, you can't quite.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.300
And Clark Bishop.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.800
I tackle you, and I'm kind of like trying

12:19.800 --> 12:21.900
to pin you maybe to the ground, and I'm

12:21.900 --> 12:24.700
trying to get the watch out of your hand and get it away.

12:24.700 --> 12:29.200
And I'm just like maybe bashing your whole back into the ground.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.700
Why did you put it on again?

12:30.700 --> 12:32.500
Why did you put it on again?

12:32.500 --> 12:35.600
So as Clark Bishop is screaming this and he's on top of you,

12:35.600 --> 12:39.100
I'm going to have you roll an unarmed combat or a strength

12:39.100 --> 12:43.300
to avoid taking some sort of damage here.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.600
Let's see.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.500
OK.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.300
17 on a 65.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.400
So that'll be enough to allow you to cover

12:53.400 --> 12:55.700
the back of your neck and the back of your skull

12:55.700 --> 12:57.400
as he's just hitting you in the ground.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.200
But he does get a hold of the watch,

12:59.300 --> 13:02.100
and he throws it into the grass nearby.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.500
What the fuck is wrong with you?

13:03.500 --> 13:04.700
What are you doing?

13:04.700 --> 13:05.200
I just.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.600
I scramble to get it done.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.600
Knowing that the watch is away and I've pummeled you

13:08.600 --> 13:12.500
into the ground a few times, my eyes kind of relax,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.900
and I stop maybe doing it quite as hard,

13:14.900 --> 13:18.300
but I'm still kind of jostling you.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.200
And then my hands are moving to your chest,

13:20.200 --> 13:24.700
and it's a little more like, I am, I am, I.

13:24.700 --> 13:27.500
And he gets to his feet and goes and kind of walks

13:27.500 --> 13:29.600
away embarrassed, but doesn't say much.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.300
Clark is walking away embarrassed

13:31.300 --> 13:33.200
as Keith is on the ground.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.000
John is standing right next to you all with the watch in hand.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Yeah, he has his back turned to that

13:39.000 --> 13:41.500
after he sees that Clark is settling down

13:41.500 --> 13:43.400
and he puts the watch on.

13:43.400 --> 13:55.800
I knew this episode was just going to be this.

13:55.800 --> 14:00.800
Oh, the watch tent you crave.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.100
Oh, Lottie, Lottie.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.800
Goodbye, my boys.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.900
Hello, Thomas.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.400
Hi, Zach.

14:15.400 --> 14:20.600
Well, the familiar reality channel changing

14:20.600 --> 14:24.700
has still unsettling, but you know what you're getting into,

14:24.700 --> 14:27.200
and you're standing over a man's body,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
and he's face down in the dry crack dirt

14:29.200 --> 14:30.500
you've seen him before.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.300
The smell of piss.

14:31.300 --> 14:31.900
Same man.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.300
Yep, same man.

14:33.300 --> 14:37.800
The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air,

14:37.800 --> 14:40.800
and looking down the road to your perceived destination,

14:40.800 --> 14:44.300
you recognize your hometown of contention.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.100
Back to the body on the ground,

14:46.100 --> 14:49.700
your hands are trembling as you roll him over,

14:49.700 --> 14:54.900
a dead man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine,

14:54.900 --> 14:59.200
dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s,

14:59.200 --> 15:01.500
and a trifolded piece of parchment

15:01.500 --> 15:05.600
falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.900
It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company,

15:09.900 --> 15:13.900
and it reads, we is hiring able bodies,

15:13.900 --> 15:16.000
readying untapped sight.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.600
Plenty of work.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.600
Hesitate not.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.600
That's crazy.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.600
If I hadn't accidentally heard the end of the episode

15:27.600 --> 15:30.800
with Luke hearing that, it would have been a big reveal.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.900
John Lee Pettymore III slips this watch off,

15:41.900 --> 15:43.900
and you see Keith Vigna.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.300
What are you doing on the ground?

15:45.300 --> 15:46.400
I had the wind knocked out of me,

15:46.400 --> 15:48.100
so I'm just trying to catch my breath

15:48.100 --> 15:49.500
and slowly get back up.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.500
When Keith is back on his feet, I'll turn him back around.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.400
Keith, I'm sorry.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
That watch is freaky.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.000
I don't know why you would willingly just put it back on.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.800
I just needed to get more info, and I got what I needed,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.300
and I look over at John.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.000
You see the watch slipping off his hand,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.300
and he turns around with kind of a wide expression.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.300
Did you see the same thing?

16:15.300 --> 16:17.700
No.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.400
I mean, you remember the dead man and the vision?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.300
Yeah.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.500
This time, a note slipped out of his pocket.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.900
I saw the same thing.

16:24.900 --> 16:30.100
Written in the same crazy grammar as the initial...

16:30.100 --> 16:31.300
Yeah.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.200
We used striking torches.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.300
Hesitate not, that one?

16:35.300 --> 16:36.300
Yes.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.400
Yeah, it had the same sort of thing.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.800
It had we is and hesitate not.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.800
If I wanted to recite that to you,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.700
it would sound like this.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.100
We is striking when the land gets darkness.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.700
Readying torches, hesitate not.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.000
I meant the one I just heard.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
We is hiring able bodies.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.400
Readying untapped sight.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.900
Plenty of work.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.900
Hesitate not.

17:02.900 --> 17:03.900
Cool.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.700
And you found it on the old-timey guy, too?

17:06.700 --> 17:08.300
Yeah, I'm afraid I did.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.800
Yeah, I saw that same thing the second time I put it on.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.900
Joe, what do you see?

17:11.900 --> 17:12.900
Clark, what do you see?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.600
And I slapped a watch on his hands.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.300
Oh, OK.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.300
Are you willing to let that happen?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.500
I mean, I think Clark is in a state

17:22.500 --> 17:24.400
that he wouldn't be ready for it.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.900
He was already apologizing and embarrassed

17:26.900 --> 17:28.100
and talking to Keith.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.100
Sucker watch.

17:35.700 --> 17:39.800
Reality begins to blink and flicker in a now familiar

17:39.800 --> 17:42.100
but still unsettling way.

17:42.100 --> 17:45.100
And you're standing over a man's body face down

17:45.100 --> 17:46.700
in the dry cracked dirt.

17:46.700 --> 17:51.100
The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air.

17:51.100 --> 17:55.200
And looking down the road to your perceived destination,

17:55.200 --> 17:58.000
you recognize your hometown of contention.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.300
Back to the body on the ground, your hands

18:00.300 --> 18:04.100
are trembling as you roll him over a dead man

18:04.100 --> 18:07.600
in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine,

18:07.700 --> 18:11.900
dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.900
And a trifolded piece of parchment

18:13.900 --> 18:17.300
falls out of the deceased man's jacket pocket.

18:17.300 --> 18:21.700
It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company.

18:21.700 --> 18:26.900
And it reads, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight,

18:26.900 --> 18:29.600
plenty of work, hesitate not.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.600
All righty.

18:32.600 --> 18:38.700
And the watch comes off of Clark Bishop's wrist.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.100
I want to catch it and put it on again.

18:41.100 --> 18:51.100
All right.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.500
Let's see how many of these fucking things Zach prepared.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.300
Luke and Joe, take your headphones off.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.700
He goes to catch it, and it slips onto his wrist

18:58.700 --> 18:59.400
accidentally.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.400
All of a sudden, you're looking at Bean's pond.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.800
You see Tilde B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards

19:15.800 --> 19:18.400
away from you toward the water.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.900
She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood

19:21.900 --> 19:25.500
pond, and she continues in steadily

19:25.500 --> 19:28.500
until the water rises above her head.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.400
And when she is gone, the channel of your reality

19:32.400 --> 19:36.900
changes, and you are sitting at the bar in a tavern.

19:36.900 --> 19:41.600
Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.900
Your eyes are wild.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.600
You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing

19:47.600 --> 19:51.800
from the dead body you found on the way into town.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.300
The barmaid refills your glass.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.600
So you're the new miner in town who wrote ahead

19:57.600 --> 19:59.300
looking for a room?

19:59.300 --> 20:01.200
You look in the mirror again.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.900
You see your reflection.

20:02.900 --> 20:07.900
Still, you give a nod to the alewife.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.800
Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.300
Oh, shit.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.200
I got chills, baby.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.900
You guys have to put this watch on again.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.900
This episode sucks.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.200
And you guys see?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.700
And you guys see?

20:40.700 --> 20:43.400
Oh, no.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.100
And you guys see the watch slip off of a John Lee Betty

20:46.100 --> 20:48.000
more than their sand?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.300
And he instantly slaps it on Clark's hand?

20:55.600 --> 20:58.300
God damn it!

20:58.300 --> 20:59.000
OK, bye.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.400
Take your headphones off, Luke.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.700
We're playing a closed game.

21:11.300 --> 21:11.800
Joe.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.700
I love it.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.200
Yeah.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.000
Ugh.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.400
I got to put the same amount of, like, gravitas into each one,

21:19.400 --> 21:20.100
right?

21:20.100 --> 21:22.700
So we can see your faces with this new method.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.300
And Thomas's faces with whatever you were describing was great.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.000
You're looking at Bean's pond.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.300
You see Tildy B. Mitchell walking slowly

21:32.300 --> 21:36.500
backwards away from you toward the water.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.700
She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood

21:39.700 --> 21:40.700
pond.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.300
And as she continues in steadily,

21:43.300 --> 21:46.100
the water rises above her head.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.500
And when she's gone, the channel of your reality changes,

21:49.500 --> 21:52.600
and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.600
Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.100
Your eyes are wild.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.900
You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing

22:01.900 --> 22:06.400
from the dead body you found on the way into town.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.200
The barmaid refills your glass.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.600
So you're the new miner in town who

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
rode ahead looking for a room?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.500
You look in the mirror again.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.100
You see your reflection.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.700
Still, you give a nod to the alewife.

22:20.700 --> 22:24.300
Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.

22:24.300 --> 22:30.700
Oh, holy shit.

22:30.700 --> 22:42.300
And you guys see the watch slip off of Clark Bishop's wrist.

22:42.300 --> 22:43.300
I look at John.

22:43.300 --> 22:47.300
He's just wide-eyed, and he's nodding at you, like, right?

22:47.300 --> 22:48.300
Right?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.300
What did you guys see?

22:50.300 --> 22:50.900
Throw it on him.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.100
I slapped it on Keith.

22:53.100 --> 22:53.600
God damn it.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.200
OK.

22:55.200 --> 22:59.100
We should make pretending to be people slap bracelets.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.100
We will now, yeah.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.700
The watch slap bracelets.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.700
Also, we should experiment after this one

23:05.700 --> 23:08.100
if, like, if we all hold hands, we can experience

23:08.100 --> 23:09.500
these visions at the same time.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.300
You know what?

23:10.300 --> 23:11.700
I don't have that written anywhere,

23:11.700 --> 23:12.900
but it sure would help.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.100
All right, Lukey.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.900
OK, let's hear it.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.900
You're looking at Bean's Pond.

23:26.900 --> 23:30.900
You see Tildi B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards away

23:30.900 --> 23:33.200
from you toward the water.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.100
She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood

23:36.100 --> 23:36.900
pond.

23:36.900 --> 23:39.400
And as she continues in steadily,

23:39.400 --> 23:42.200
the water rises above her head.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.300
When she's gone, the channel of your reality changes,

23:45.300 --> 23:47.600
and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern.

23:47.600 --> 23:52.200
Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.700
Your eyes, though, are wild.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.800
You recognize your thick, hand-stitched clothing

23:57.800 --> 24:01.500
from the dead body you found on the way into town.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.100
The barmaid refills your glass.

24:04.100 --> 24:07.200
So you're the new miner in town who rode ahead

24:07.200 --> 24:08.600
looking for a room?

24:08.600 --> 24:10.400
You look in the mirror again.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.200
You see your reflection.

24:12.200 --> 24:15.600
Still, you give a nod to the alewife.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.700
Well, welcome to contention, Silas Cole.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.200
Ooh.

24:25.200 --> 24:27.200
I take the watch and put it in my pocket.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.200
We were binging that watch.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
Did you guys...

24:39.200 --> 24:41.200
Did you guys...

24:41.200 --> 24:43.200
Were you guys Silas Cole, too?

24:43.200 --> 24:44.200
Yeah.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.200
Yeah.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.200
That's fucking crazy, right?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.200
You want to try it one more time?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.200
Kinda.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.200
If we all hold hands,

24:52.200 --> 24:55.700
do you think we might experience the vision together?

24:55.700 --> 24:57.200
I mean, it can't hurt.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.700
And I hand the watch over to you

24:58.700 --> 25:01.700
and grab your hand and Clark's hand.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.700
I grab... I complete the triangle.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.700
All right, I'm holding both your hands.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.700
Somebody has to put this watch on for me.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.700
I put it on his wrist.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.700
Just clasp it.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.700
Thank you.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.700
And then grab his hand.

25:13.700 --> 25:14.700
Okay.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.700
At the same time,

25:21.700 --> 25:26.700
At the same time, all of your realities begin to sort of fade away and warp,

25:26.700 --> 25:28.700
and it's dark.

25:28.700 --> 25:32.700
You can barely make out the silhouette of a hooded figure

25:32.700 --> 25:37.200
lurking in the shadows of this confined space.

25:37.200 --> 25:43.200
But light floods in, illuminating a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop,

25:43.200 --> 25:46.700
clutching a book made of some sort of uncured leather,

25:46.700 --> 25:49.200
blood dripping from its spine.

25:49.200 --> 25:53.200
The visibility is due to the opening of this empty tomb.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.200
In walks a tall, gaunt creature with translucent skin

25:57.200 --> 25:59.700
and stretched out limbs wearing a black suit.

25:59.700 --> 26:06.700
Hello, subject 1-5-2-2-5-1-8-1-9-5-5-1-8.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.700
Please give me the book.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.200
After a beat, both figures sprint towards each other,

26:12.200 --> 26:13.700
only ten feet apart to start,

26:13.700 --> 26:18.200
and a blinding light cleanses the interior of this mausoleum

26:18.200 --> 26:23.700
before you see Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth

26:23.700 --> 26:27.700
carry in the casket of Ari Manstein,

26:27.700 --> 26:33.700
set it down gently, exit, and close the door of the tomb behind them.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.200
And the three of you step back away from each other.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.700
Ah, I mean, I preferred the episodes in the main timeline.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.200
That was fine.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
What the hell does this even mean?

26:51.200 --> 26:53.200
I think everybody roll Sanity on that one.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.200
Oh, fuck.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.200
Seven, hell yeah.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.200
Oh my god.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.200
What'd you get?

27:02.200 --> 27:03.700
An eighty-seven.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.700
That's so for my power.

27:05.700 --> 27:07.200
I got a one.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.200
No way!

27:08.200 --> 27:08.700
Yahweh.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.700
Hell yeah.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.700
Yahweh, our lord.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.200
Luke and Thomas, take off your headphones.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.700
Oh no.

27:16.700 --> 27:23.700
First, lose one Sanity.

27:23.700 --> 27:24.700
Did that.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.200
I'm at fourteen now.

27:26.200 --> 27:27.200
Congrats.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.200
Thanks.

27:29.200 --> 27:34.700
Clark Bishop, as you back away, you notice that there is ooze that is dripping out of

27:34.700 --> 27:40.000
the nose, eyes, and ears, and a little bit out of the mouth of John Lee Pettymore the

27:40.000 --> 27:48.500
Thirth and you see that it has somehow wrapped itself around like coming down his arm and

27:48.500 --> 27:53.500
it seems to be dripping from both of his hands and looking down you kind of see that it's

27:53.500 --> 27:59.500
on your hands too and it's on Keith's hands and you seem to have just been connected just

27:59.500 --> 28:08.500
now by this black oily viscous ooze and as you back away it drips off your hands and

28:08.500 --> 28:14.500
onto the ground and some of the stuff that's a part of John Lee Pettymore just drips from

28:14.500 --> 28:21.000
his face he doesn't seem to notice that it's on him or in him and as it collects on the

28:21.000 --> 28:28.500
ground you look down and it begins moving toward you and then you blink and you can't

28:28.500 --> 28:29.500
see it anymore.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.500
Oh shit.

28:30.500 --> 28:35.500
While they're away, can I ask you, can that be part of my reaction to the over the power

28:35.500 --> 28:36.500
thing?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.500
Yes.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.500
But the deal though is that I have to inflict harm on someone so I can't just run away from

28:40.500 --> 28:41.500
it, right?

28:41.500 --> 28:42.500
Nope.

28:42.500 --> 28:46.500
Does it have to be one of them or can I lash out like at the thing that I think is the

28:46.500 --> 28:47.500
goo that is no longer there?

28:47.500 --> 28:48.500
You can lash out at the thing that's there.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.500
Okay.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.500
Absolutely.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
Okay, cool.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
Yeah.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.500
Cool.

28:53.500 --> 28:59.500
Uh, yeah, I'm going to rip a piss too.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.500
Cool.

29:00.500 --> 29:04.500
I'll tell Luke he can come back so we can hang out.

29:04.500 --> 29:10.000
They both went to go take a pee, but I didn't want to be alone.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.500
I'm going to go pee too then.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.500
Fuck.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.500
All by myself.

29:13.500 --> 29:14.500
Don't want to be all by myself.

29:14.500 --> 29:15.500
Hey, here's Thomas.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.500
Don't want to be.

29:16.500 --> 29:33.000
Hey, Joe, while Zach's not here, tell us what you saw.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.960
He just described a real pornographic scene that he had seen earlier today.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.500
It wasn't even story related.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.500
Wow.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.500
Was it good?

29:40.500 --> 29:41.500
It was all right.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.500
He liked it for sure.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.500
The way he described it.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.500
Yeah.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.500
What brand was it?

29:45.500 --> 29:46.500
Genre.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.000
I don't know what the...

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Gucci.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
It used a lot of inanimate objects.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.160
It was, it was odd, but tasteful.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.920
The three of you step away from each other and Clark Bishop's eyes widen.

29:58.920 --> 30:03.680
Clark is wide eyed, wild, and starts backing away and he starts slapping your guys' hands

30:03.680 --> 30:05.480
and then stomping on the ground really hard.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.480
It's here.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.480
It's here.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.480
It's here.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.480
It's here.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.060
And he's kind of running away and he's pointing at the ground and stomping at the ground and...

30:12.060 --> 30:13.060
What is it?

30:13.060 --> 30:14.060
What's here?

30:14.060 --> 30:15.060
What's here?

30:15.060 --> 30:16.060
It's the goo.

30:16.060 --> 30:17.060
It's the goo.

30:17.060 --> 30:18.060
It's the goo.

30:18.060 --> 30:19.060
It's the goo.

30:19.060 --> 30:20.060
And he's like stomping around.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.060
I can't see it anymore.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.060
I can't see it anymore, but it was here.

30:22.060 --> 30:23.060
It was on you guys.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.060
Wipe yourselves off.

30:24.060 --> 30:25.060
Wipe yourselves off.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.060
I start spitting on my hands.

30:26.060 --> 30:28.240
I see that and I think that's a good idea, so I start doing that.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.560
Are we near any water?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.560
Let's look.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.880
No.

30:32.880 --> 30:38.640
So you guys are just east of Hotel Motel on the map of contention here.

30:38.640 --> 30:43.780
I see them spitting on themselves or whatever, but I'm like, Clark, you're just freaking

30:43.780 --> 30:44.780
out.

30:44.780 --> 30:45.780
It's not here.

30:45.780 --> 30:46.780
We can't see it.

30:46.780 --> 30:47.780
You can't see it anymore.

30:47.780 --> 30:48.780
It's fine.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.780
We're fine.

30:49.780 --> 30:50.780
You guys.

30:50.780 --> 30:51.780
You were covered in it.

30:51.780 --> 30:52.780
You were covered in it.

30:52.780 --> 30:53.780
It was on the ground.

30:53.780 --> 30:54.780
It started moving toward me.

30:54.780 --> 30:55.780
It started moving toward me.

30:56.320 --> 31:03.840
Clark, in life, you're going to be covered in all kinds of goos, just at different times.

31:03.840 --> 31:12.220
So I mean, just take a deep breath, wipe yourself off, you know, crack a cold one.

31:12.220 --> 31:13.920
That's what we do in convention.

31:13.920 --> 31:14.920
Do you have a cold one?

31:14.920 --> 31:15.920
Do you have a cold one?

31:15.920 --> 31:16.920
We can pour it on ourselves.

31:16.920 --> 31:17.920
We can pour it on ourselves.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.920
Do you have one?

31:18.920 --> 31:20.240
I slip the watch back into my pocket.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.240
Thank God.

31:21.240 --> 31:25.480
I thought you were going to slip it back on.

31:26.180 --> 31:31.380
I mean, we'll keep this for later because it could tell us something, but man, I think

31:31.380 --> 31:33.580
we ought to get to the pond.

31:33.580 --> 31:35.980
I kind of want to do it one more time.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.940
I'm staring at their, like, demeanors.

31:37.940 --> 31:41.460
Are they okay now?

31:41.460 --> 31:42.940
Yeah.

31:42.940 --> 31:43.940
I feel fine.

31:43.940 --> 31:44.940
Oh.

31:44.940 --> 31:45.940
We were not okay when you saw.

31:45.940 --> 31:46.940
Okay.

31:46.940 --> 31:47.940
Gotcha.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.780
How much sanity do you guys all have, Carious?

31:49.780 --> 31:50.780
Fourteen.

31:50.780 --> 31:51.780
Twenty-five.

31:51.780 --> 31:54.780
Fourteen, twenty-five, and fourteen?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.080
I'm at fourteen, yeah.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.080
Haha.

31:57.080 --> 32:01.400
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

32:01.400 --> 32:08.320
So yeah, you're a Cyclops for sure because twenty-five sanity, you're the kind of person

32:08.320 --> 32:17.360
that people walk on eggshells around, but fourteen sanity is more like people are noticing

32:17.360 --> 32:22.760
because you're more almost, I mean, you're on your way to being, like, primordial back

32:22.760 --> 32:32.660
to a time where beings like us didn't worry about morality.

32:32.660 --> 32:37.620
I think we, let's get back to the, do you think we should walk there, get back to the

32:37.620 --> 32:42.140
car, or, what do you think?

32:42.140 --> 32:43.420
Where is the pond?

32:43.420 --> 32:45.860
Oh, right by Maggie Cook's house?

32:45.860 --> 32:48.300
Yeah, it's way further south from us.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.740
We're pretty far away from it.

32:49.740 --> 32:53.760
Well, we parked the car where we parked it because we were gonna come across a big checkpoint,

32:53.760 --> 32:54.760
right?

32:54.760 --> 32:55.760
Right.

32:55.760 --> 32:56.760
Yeah.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.600
Is there a way to come into town from, like, the south part?

32:58.600 --> 32:59.600
The south part?

32:59.600 --> 33:00.600
No.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.680
I mean, there's roads that lead south, but, okay.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.240
Can we loop around somehow, like backroads and stuff?

33:06.240 --> 33:10.760
You could easily loop around and go around backroads, however, at this exact moment,

33:10.760 --> 33:16.040
you hear a voice that is coming from just south of you guys.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.040
There's a small neighborhood.

33:18.040 --> 33:22.660
Did you just see it, Luke?

33:22.660 --> 33:32.300
Sorry, I just tagged Luke in an Instagram story, which you should all watch.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.780
Oh, that's so stupid.

33:34.780 --> 33:50.720
That's great.

33:50.720 --> 33:56.960
You were doing it for so long, and I caught you when you started to get normal again.

33:56.960 --> 34:09.820
You can go to our Instagram, at pretending pod, or our Twitter, at pretending pod, or

34:09.820 --> 34:16.180
our Facebook, pretending to be people, to see that short video of Luke just really getting

34:16.180 --> 34:17.180
in there.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.180
Behind the scenes during the recording session.

34:18.180 --> 34:21.360
You can tell how much I'm just focused in.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.360
How clued in.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.360
Locked in.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.360
Okay.

34:24.360 --> 34:32.260
I mentioned before how quiet it was in contention, but you don't even realize, like, when you

34:32.260 --> 34:38.880
hear a truck that is close, literally a block away from you guys, it is the loudest thing

34:38.880 --> 34:45.580
in your ears currently, is this truck in the distance, and then you hear it, like, pull

34:45.580 --> 34:49.000
to a stop, and when it's idling, it's so much louder.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.420
This person is not taking care of their truck.

34:51.420 --> 34:55.900
When you hear a holler, all right, come on out of there, Randy.

34:55.900 --> 35:00.560
We can do this the easy way, or you can disappear.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.900
How much worse can it possibly get?

35:02.900 --> 35:04.320
You don't want to give daddy a shot?

35:04.320 --> 35:07.360
He can go back and fix everything back to normal.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.160
We need more bodies, Randy.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.160
Oh, shit.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.000
It sounds like they got Randy Anx told up in there.

35:13.000 --> 35:18.580
They're about to be in a world of shit.

35:18.580 --> 35:21.060
Can we recognize the voice?

35:21.060 --> 35:26.240
What would be a social, let's have a, is there charisma in this game?

35:26.240 --> 35:28.000
How long have we been playing Delta Green?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Three years?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
There is, uh, Persuade and Humant.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
There is indeed charisma.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.800
Oh, charisma is one of the, is that one of the top ones?

35:36.800 --> 35:37.800
Yeah.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.800
The base stats, yeah.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.800
Yeah.

35:39.800 --> 35:40.800
Who's got the best charisma?

35:40.800 --> 35:41.800
I've got six feet.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.800
I have 75.

35:42.800 --> 35:43.800
Nice.

35:43.800 --> 35:44.800
That'd be Luke.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.800
Wait, what the fuck?

35:45.800 --> 35:46.800
Keith Wigner.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.800
That's how I talk about it.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.800
Yeah, you've been roleplaying that really well.

35:51.800 --> 35:55.800
I think Keith Wigner is so charismatic personally.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.800
Go ahead and roll on that 75.

35:57.800 --> 35:58.800
He's no Ron Stampler.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.800
Uh, shit.

35:59.800 --> 36:00.800
I got a 99.

36:00.800 --> 36:01.800
Oh no.

36:01.800 --> 36:02.800
What?

36:02.800 --> 36:15.800
Yeah, I had to make sure that it didn't say like 80 or zero.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.800
It says 99.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.800
Okay, well then here's the deal.

36:19.800 --> 36:25.800
Luke, uh, Keith Wigner knows exactly who that voice is and it's Terrence Liquor.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.800
And you know that Terrence Liquor-

36:27.800 --> 36:30.800
From Liquors Liquors?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.800
He owns the liquor store, which-

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
Liquors Liquors.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.800
It mails envelopes for you.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.800
That's Liquors Liquors Liquors.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
Liquors Liquors Liquors.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.800
There's Liquors Kickers, which is the shoe store.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.800
At the gas station you can buy a Liquors Snickers.

36:47.800 --> 36:53.800
Which is just Snickers from a regular Snickers truck that the Liquors family has like held

36:53.800 --> 36:56.800
up and they're selling for 50 cents more.

36:56.800 --> 37:00.800
Do they like tape something on to the label to make it different?

37:00.800 --> 37:02.800
Uh huh.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.800
His stand up is Liquors Bickers.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.800
One L over the S N.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.800
Okay, what's Terry Liquor doing?

37:12.800 --> 37:13.800
Terrence Liquor.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.800
What's his middle name?

37:15.800 --> 37:16.800
Terrence.

37:16.800 --> 37:17.800
Terrence Elizabeth.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.800
Yeah.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.800
Terrence Elizabeth Liquor.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.800
Average height, dirty overalls, boots, trucker hat, long oily hair.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.800
Always has a lip packed with chew and the scent of booze on his breath.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.800
Oil stained hands and a ripped flannel shirt.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.800
Thinks he's smarter than he really is.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.800
Prone to flattery, short temper, questionable morals if it'll benefit him.

37:36.800 --> 37:43.800
These are the things that Keith Wigner knows because Terrence Liquor and Keith Wigner do not get along.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.800
Shout out to B. Crever on our Patreon.

37:46.800 --> 37:52.800
This is the first use of an NPC from our patrons at the $10 level.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.800
So thank you B. Crever.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.800
Super cool.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.800
For providing Terrence Liquor to me to murder.

37:59.800 --> 38:08.800
So, uh, Luke, Keith Wigner had a run in with Terrence Liquor who's the owner of the Liquors Liquors.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.800
I believe it was Liquors.

38:11.800 --> 38:15.800
What is this, uh, what is this issue that you guys had?

38:15.800 --> 38:25.800
He owes me three $1 bills.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.800
They were your lucky dollars.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.800
No, he asked him to make change at the register and he...

38:30.800 --> 38:34.800
Yeah, he, I gave him a five. He gave me, he gave me two and he...

38:34.800 --> 38:39.800
He wanted to give you 12 quarters, but you're like, fuck that, give me a $3 bill.

38:39.800 --> 38:49.800
So I gave him a five, he gave me two bucks, shook up my Bud Light, handed it over and said...

38:49.800 --> 38:51.800
Fuck you Beans.

38:51.800 --> 38:58.800
Beans, Beans, Keith Beans, his only friends are figurines.

38:58.800 --> 39:08.800
I was there not as a patron, but to check his liquor license and I wanted a beer at the time so I gave him a five, he gave me two, shook up my beer and...

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
I got beef.

39:10.800 --> 39:15.800
Well, it sounds like we just need to apprehend him and we have grounds to do it.

39:15.800 --> 39:23.800
When I, when I hear him yelling at Randy Angst, I just put my hand up to the guys and like, listen for a second.

39:23.800 --> 39:30.800
I'm like, that's fucking tea liquor. Let's go get his ass.

39:30.800 --> 39:35.800
Remember that $3 bill incident? That's him.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.800
That guy that shook up your beer? Kevin burst out laughing.

39:39.800 --> 39:43.800
John Lee Kevin Moore, just like laughs.

39:43.800 --> 39:53.800
I know you're, uh, I know you're sore at this feller, but, uh, should we maybe scout the situation out first, wreck an order, see if we can't go in from behind and help Randy out?

39:53.800 --> 39:57.800
If you want to, and I pull my gun out and start walking towards the disturbance.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.800
Stay behind the tree line, Keith. Don't lose the element of surprise.

40:01.800 --> 40:06.800
Yes. My face is like red and I'm stomping towards the noise.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.800
I reach into his pocket, grab the watch and throw it on him.

40:09.800 --> 40:15.800
He doesn't.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.800
He doesn't.

40:19.800 --> 40:24.800
Well, if you're reaching in Keith's pocket, you'll have to go, uh, you'll have to go dexterity.

40:24.800 --> 40:32.800
Also, you got to find out which pocket it is in my cargo shorts and they're huge. So pick a pocket, any pocket.

40:32.800 --> 40:41.800
You can go criminology. Keith, you're rolling against him with alertness or dexterity or athletics.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.800
Okay. I'm going to roll criminology because now that I'm a robot, I'm less dextrous.

40:45.800 --> 40:51.800
I got a nine on a 60. I got a 50 on a 50.

40:51.800 --> 40:57.800
Well, tell us what happens. You can get the wall. You can get the watch out of his big ass pockets in my imagining.

40:57.800 --> 41:03.800
He's so mad at, uh, at tea liquor that he's not really paying attention. I like kind of pay attention to him.

41:03.800 --> 41:08.800
I see it happening. And before I can react, his hand is out of my pocket again.

41:08.800 --> 41:15.800
And I point up to this guy and I say, look over there. And then I slap it on his hands.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.800
Can I try to fight it slapping on my wrist? Yeah.

41:19.800 --> 41:24.800
Yeah. It'll be another, uh, either dexterity or athletics.

41:24.800 --> 41:31.800
50 on a 50 dexterity. Yep. That seems legit.

41:31.800 --> 41:40.800
It is. Look. I don't know if you can even see that. Yeah. Oh wow. That is 50.

41:40.800 --> 41:50.800
I can see there's literally no way Luke could have like found exactly on those dice that fast.

41:50.800 --> 41:57.800
And Thomas, I assume that you can't beat that. No, I rolled a 24 on a 50. So I guess so I'm, I'm stomping away.

41:57.800 --> 42:03.800
Well, that was a, that was a contest for you not to, to somehow make him not put the watch on you. So you get it right.

42:04.800 --> 42:11.800
Already too far away. He grabbed it out of my pockets and I'm already, yeah, he's gone.

42:11.800 --> 42:16.800
He's, he's walking. You, you're holding the watch. You tried to slap it on his wrist real quick, but he's walking away.

42:16.800 --> 42:21.800
I turn around, like really exasperated and give Clark a side, but then I try to sneak it on his wrist.

42:21.800 --> 42:29.800
On to my, on to Clark's wrist. Yeah.

42:29.800 --> 42:35.800
Yeah. I mean, I would like to contest that at that point. I'm looking at him as it happens.

42:35.800 --> 42:42.800
Yep. Dexterity or athletics against each other.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.800
No, I rolled a 97.

42:46.800 --> 42:53.800
I rolled a 48 on a 60. I'm good. I just, I just, I just slap your hand away.

42:53.800 --> 43:00.800
John, John misses again and very like exasperated. Like he just lets out a huge sigh and then slaps it on himself.

43:00.800 --> 43:05.800
Yep. All right. Take your headphones off.

43:05.800 --> 43:14.800
Well, Thomas, you got me.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.800
Did we reach the limits of your preparation?

43:17.800 --> 43:25.800
Well, I didn't have like a million things written down for what happens when you put the watch on over and over and over and over again.

43:25.800 --> 43:32.800
It's like a whole episode of watchness. So here's what I will tell you.

43:33.800 --> 43:40.800
You just want to make it easy on yourself and say the visions start looping. Like you're back to the door.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.800
That's not fun. Here's what I'm going to do.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.800
I'm going to tell you what happens and then I'm going to go in and rerecord a cool version of it later.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.800
Sure, sure, sure. I'll react to what you're saying. Like it's the cool version.

43:50.800 --> 43:54.800
Okay, perfect.

43:54.800 --> 44:02.800
What a bright flash of light almost makes your eyes feel warm and then you see an abandoned warehouse.

44:02.800 --> 44:11.800
Puddles have collected from rain and in them you can see the reflection of the moonlight pouring in through the crack and hole filled roof.

44:11.800 --> 44:20.800
Three figures are standing near the wall and the shadows and their silhouette looks like a race podium or dug trio.

44:20.800 --> 44:27.800
But the tallest figure looks massive like a human that has been stretched out.

44:27.800 --> 44:39.800
Closer you see this lemmy suit clad translucent skinned creature hands a small manila envelope to the two actual humans standing before it.

44:39.800 --> 44:47.800
A man and a woman. They open the envelope and inside there's only a small piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol.

44:47.800 --> 44:57.800
It is a filled in circle encircled by six circles. Another bright flash of light engulfs your vision and you see James the mill worker.

44:57.800 --> 45:04.800
Just James dragging two bodies. This man and woman you just saw across the floor of his house.

45:04.800 --> 45:12.800
And then we see these two individuals from above. They're sitting lifeless at the bottom of a small man-made pit.

45:12.800 --> 45:17.800
And you see a sort of time lapse of the bodies bloat and change color.

45:17.800 --> 45:22.800
And then Clark Bishop falls into this pit and your vision is again consumed by light.

45:22.800 --> 45:33.800
As it fades you see Chief Maggie Cook giving orders to a looming overweight man wearing an all black combat uniform.

45:33.800 --> 45:38.800
And he has a large scar over his right eye.

45:38.800 --> 45:42.800
Okay.

45:42.800 --> 45:48.800
Can I just keep putting this watch on and seeing the background of all the mysteries?

45:48.800 --> 45:49.800
Yes.

45:49.800 --> 45:55.800
I mean I'm going to pitch that to the guys and break your little podcast wide open.

45:55.800 --> 45:58.800
Good. We need to answer some questions.

45:58.800 --> 46:02.800
But not too many and that's on you.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.800
Hello.

46:10.800 --> 46:14.800
Zach your shirt is very Star Trek The Next Generation.

46:14.800 --> 46:15.800
Thank you.

46:15.800 --> 46:18.800
That's Joe's least favorite Star Trek.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.800
That was a deadly insult.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.800
Would it be better if I had like all the way?

46:23.800 --> 46:29.800
The buttons that were laying on your chest made it look like pips from Star Trek. That's what helped the illusion.

46:29.800 --> 46:30.800
Oh. Whoops.

46:30.800 --> 46:34.800
You forgot about your pips. You forgot about your pips.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.800
Lattice.

46:37.800 --> 46:46.800
Okay. So. Keith Vigna is just ahead of you guys making his way toward the Confrontation House.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.800
Confrontation House. A new reality.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.800
Keith House.

46:50.800 --> 46:58.800
And Clark Bishop just ripped his hand away from John Lee Pettymore the Third who slapped on the bracelet onto himself.

46:58.800 --> 47:03.800
I look wide eyed at you. Did you see something else?

47:03.800 --> 47:06.800
Guys. Yeah. I mean. Keith! Keith!

47:06.800 --> 47:12.800
We really need to be putting on this like this watch cause we're getting some good shit here.

47:12.800 --> 47:17.800
I turn around and look at him and I'm like slowly walking backwards but I'm listening.

47:17.800 --> 47:25.800
Well hey like remember when that robot feller attacked us in James the Mill worker's house.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.800
You know the first time we met Randy.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
Yeah.

47:28.800 --> 47:32.800
Well so you wanna know why? Cause that's what I just saw.

47:32.800 --> 47:33.800
Alright. Get this.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.800
Why the robot attacked us?

47:35.800 --> 47:38.800
Well why he was there in the first place. Alright check it out.

47:38.800 --> 47:44.800
So. Myriad had sent two people out to like intercept James the Mill worker or something.

47:44.800 --> 47:51.800
That part wasn't super clear but James dispatched them or came into possession of their bodies somehow.

47:51.800 --> 47:56.800
But you know the two dead fellas we found at the bottom of that pit in James's house.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.800
Yeah I remember them very well.

47:58.800 --> 48:07.800
That was them and Myriad sent them and the next thing I saw was Maggie telling that robot fella to head to James the Mill worker's house.

48:07.800 --> 48:17.800
And the impression I got was that it was you know going after those bodies. It might have been to go after us but that might have been a right place wrong time situation.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.800
I've stopped in my tracks.

48:20.800 --> 48:26.800
Anyway I just like it seemed yeah Maggie she sent the robot fella after us or after James.

48:26.800 --> 48:32.800
And yeah it just seems like we get a lot of information every time we put this thing on so.

48:32.800 --> 48:37.800
I'm pretty much team watch right now. Formerly team PETA.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.800
I mean that's good to know but does it help us right now?

48:40.800 --> 48:52.800
Well I mean I don't know if it helps us rescue Randy or beat up that fella that you don't like who made a fool of you with your with your beer.

48:52.800 --> 48:56.800
But I remember why I was mad and I start stomping away again.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.800
I touch him on the shoulder I'm like hold up hold up there's time for that there's time for that.

49:04.800 --> 49:10.800
I don't know I think maybe we should go figure out this situation that that lies ahead of us right now.

49:10.800 --> 49:16.800
But it just seems like we could really blow this whole mystery open by just repeatedly putting this watch on.

49:16.800 --> 49:20.800
I don't know if you know God ever thought of that when he created such.

49:20.800 --> 49:25.800
You mentioned that Maggie was she sent the robot to kill us?

49:25.800 --> 49:30.800
She sent the she sent the robot to James the Mill worker's house. I think we just got there at the same time.

49:30.800 --> 49:37.800
Oh gotcha gotcha not okay but those two fellas that were in James's pit they was dead myriad fellas.

49:37.800 --> 49:43.800
And that robot had the myriad logo on it right? That's where we first found out about myriad.

49:43.800 --> 49:47.800
You fell into that pit you didn't find anything on him did you?

49:47.800 --> 49:50.800
Did I? Zach is nodding yes I don't remember what I found.

49:50.800 --> 49:55.800
Me neither. I just remembered that it stunk down there because they were decomposing.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.800
Which seems realistic.

49:59.800 --> 50:05.800
You know two days ago when you fell into that pit of bodies did you notice anything strange or were you just horrified?

50:07.800 --> 50:10.800
Overwhelmed by the stench of death.

50:11.800 --> 50:19.800
One is a man one was a woman they had a piece of paper that had the symbol for the circle of knowledge on it.

50:19.800 --> 50:20.800
Huh the cock.

50:20.800 --> 50:23.800
Did you find anything on their bodies?

50:23.800 --> 50:25.800
Yeah they were circle of knowledge members.

50:25.800 --> 50:27.800
Two cocks.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.800
That's right I remember.

50:29.800 --> 50:37.800
There's one piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol and it was a filled in circle encircled by six circles.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.800
Is there a chance I didn't know what it was at the time?

50:39.800 --> 50:42.800
Yeah didn't we record that like four years ago?

50:43.800 --> 50:55.800
You did so a little backstory refresher here you found that I believe you knew what the logo was.

50:55.800 --> 51:11.800
The statue's bow tie flips the coffee table over so when you like touch the statue's bow tie it flipped the coffee table over showing an enormous stash of weapons body armor and a long black plastic tube the size of a baseball bat.

51:11.800 --> 51:23.800
And then written in blood where one of the guns should be it said stop her and inside that big tube was a map of calm comfy campground.

51:24.800 --> 51:39.800
And then if you'll also remember Gary Daley told you that he saw Maggie and James and a third person going into Chief Maggie Cook's house the night that the home exploded.

51:39.800 --> 51:40.800
Yeah.

51:40.800 --> 51:47.800
The guy that was with them had a big scar over his eye and he was wearing big black tactical gear.

51:47.800 --> 51:48.800
Yep yep yep.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.800
Cool.

51:49.800 --> 51:51.800
So there's some dots.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.800
Y'all like the ice cream of the future?

51:54.800 --> 51:55.800
They're fine.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.800
I've been dipping into them.

51:57.800 --> 52:01.800
I get it I'd rather have ice cream every single time but.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.800
Sometimes I'd prefer dipping dots.

52:04.800 --> 52:05.800
It's fucking wrong.

52:05.800 --> 52:06.800
They stick to your tongue weird.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.800
Yeah because they're below zero.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.800
I like it.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.800
I like how weird it is.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
Well you know what Keith's doing.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.800
Uh okay.

52:25.800 --> 52:28.800
That uh I don't think.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.800
I don't think you have time.

52:30.800 --> 52:39.800
So as you guys are watching Keith Vigna walk off into the distance after John Lee Pettymore the third explains this to you.

52:39.800 --> 52:45.800
John and Clark. Clark is at a loss for words. He's trying to put the dots together.

52:45.800 --> 52:46.800
Well all I'm saying is.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.800
You guys moving or are you letting Keith go by himself?

52:48.800 --> 52:55.800
I guess we gotta keep after Keith but uh yeah this watch just does seem like a real handy plot device.

52:55.800 --> 52:58.800
Mystery device sorry case device.

52:58.800 --> 53:04.800
However you personally wanted to find the situation we've all found ourselves caught up in.

53:04.800 --> 53:10.800
John Lee Pettymore kind of has an ongoing narrative of his whole life just running his head at all times.

53:10.800 --> 53:18.800
I'm at a loss because Clark would be kind of into the idea that John's proposing that we're hearing we're getting more information every time we put on the watch.

53:18.800 --> 53:23.800
Clark would be very intrigued by that prospect but I think he's kind of scared of it too.

53:23.800 --> 53:33.800
John I'm actually I'm kind of on board with this idea of exploring the uses of the watch but it I'm telling you I saw last time we put it on.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
Sure.

53:34.800 --> 53:40.800
The ooze it came out of you guys. It came out of you guys. I don't think it's all good. I don't think it's all good.

53:40.800 --> 53:45.800
It may even it may even just be showing us something that who knows what it means.

53:46.800 --> 53:54.800
None of it's we don't we don't know. And Keith's walking away. I feel like maybe we should take care of what's going on now.

53:54.800 --> 54:02.800
Get to a safe spot and then maybe I don't know experiment with it or something. I don't I don't know. I just I think there's a chance it's unsafe.

54:02.800 --> 54:16.800
Clark I think I think that's a damn smart point of view. And I was perhaps tempted by this this wrist siren and it and it caused me to lose focus on on what's in front of us.

54:16.800 --> 54:24.800
And I think what we got to do now is keep Keith from getting his his damn self killed and we got to go help our friend Randy Angst.

54:24.800 --> 54:29.800
For sure. And if you heard a siren I didn't hear that. But yeah we should we should get in there.

54:30.800 --> 54:39.800
No I'm saying the watch is a siren. Yeah no I didn't I didn't hear a siren in mind either but we can go on.

54:39.800 --> 54:49.800
Keith hold up we're coming. There it is. I look back behind him and I I look ahead of me and I just yell yeah we're coming motherfucker.

54:50.800 --> 55:05.800
Okay there it is. So you guys are now coming up around the back of this house and walking up to a chain link fence that is the end of the property of this home.

55:05.800 --> 55:14.800
And so coming from the backyard you hear the truck is in the driveway of this home that you're approaching from behind the backyard.

55:15.800 --> 55:22.800
And looking through the windows in the back what's the highest alertness in the group? We got a 70. 60. Nice. Yeah.

55:22.800 --> 55:30.800
But we're up pretty good. Like we planned on being cop characters. Yeah but what's your law though? 50. I rolled a 90.

55:30.800 --> 55:42.800
You guys are looking in the back windows and you know it's got curtains and you can't really see in there's not much movement detected but the lights are on so you can't really tell what's going on.

55:42.800 --> 55:54.800
But you hear this truck just idling in the front and you're not sure if tea liquor has made his way into the house yet or if he's still out front. Which approach do you guys want to take?

55:54.800 --> 56:00.800
So I'm gonna go around the side of the house and peek then look at his truck and see if he's in there.

56:00.800 --> 56:09.800
When I see Keith peeking I'm a little encouraged by his stealthiness. Keith what do you see? Yeah roll stealth Keith.

56:10.800 --> 56:25.800
Oh good. What do you have? He has like a 10 right? Shit I got a 14 on a 10. Oh no! You're right there. That's so brutal.

56:25.800 --> 56:34.800
You guys haven't passed this stealth check since you've been back to contention. Just a quick reminder that everyone knows. Does anybody have more than 10 stealth? Yes.

56:34.800 --> 56:39.800
I got a 30.

56:39.800 --> 56:59.800
So I am like trying to peek around the corner but. And you don't notice that there's this concrete drain that moves the water away from the house and you trip over it and you fall onto the driveway like the front corner of the driveway right by the garage.

56:59.800 --> 57:12.800
And you look up and you're staring straight at this truck. In the back of the truck you see that there's a tarp slumped over the sides and there's water kind of splashing off.

57:12.800 --> 57:34.800
And you see fish kind of like jumping up through it and in the back sitting in the water in this puddle that has been teemed you see an older man who has like super long hair and hippy dippy and you recognize him as manager of Subtropolis Jimmy Sanders.

57:35.800 --> 57:46.800
How familiar are we with Jimmy? Yeah how did he feel about us before all this went down? Well it's your cousin isn't it? Yeah. He was the one who called in the oil spill. And he was older than me right? Yes.

57:46.800 --> 57:59.800
So he's probably going to recognize John Lee Pettymore the third. Oh fuck I didn't even think about that. He would have been alive before. I'm picturing since we didn't break away I'm just picturing Clark and John have like moved up into position around the side of the house.

57:59.800 --> 58:09.800
Oh no no I know that but I mean if he were to suddenly see John. Absolutely no I'm glad because he would have turned around and was like it's Jimmy Sanders it's your cousin exactly.

58:09.800 --> 58:24.800
Wait to clarify real fast and I don't know if this puts you on the spot or not but is Jimmy Sanders your dad's brother's kid or sister's I guess? Or sister's or yeah or anywhere in there I feel like no matter by marriage or blood everybody would have been to the same barbecues.

58:24.800 --> 58:38.800
And also Pettymores just call each other cousins at a certain point and like non Pettymores who are still blood related like they're all just cousins. Oh right he's got a different last name so he would have to be his sister's kid.

58:38.800 --> 58:49.800
That's what I was trying to decipher that makes sense. So he would be John the third's nephew. So does he see me? It's not necessarily that he sees you as much as he sees everything.

58:49.800 --> 59:13.800
So you're looking at this dude and his eyes are wide and wild and he's just like sniffing around he's like number four with the no tomato no tomato no tomato extra cream cheese and he's just like looking around all over the place and you think he might have seen you but he didn't like he couldn't tell.

59:13.800 --> 59:28.800
As soon as I get up I turn around to John I'm like it's your cousin and then I go and I want to get the keys out of the truck. Yeah so I'll go to cover you while you do that. I'll go to get Jimmy's attention while you're slipping around to grab the keys.

59:28.800 --> 59:45.800
I think Clark is still trying to peek into the windows at the corner here trying to get a better look through. So as Keith sneaks out John wants to just like really visibly pop out and he goes Jimmy hey there kiddo do you remember me?

59:45.800 --> 01:00:08.800
Hey number four lettuce no extra cucumber but I can't cut it in half right now. And he's like miming actually making a sandwich. Running with that he's like oh yeah give me that number four why don't you go ahead and start making that for me and I don't it doesn't have to be cut in half you just get to it and I want to see what he does.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:28.800
And then he looks up at you and as he makes direct eye contact with you his eyes enlarge to the size of saucers and he just lets out a little and then dives directly into the water Keith just walks up opens the car door what are you doing?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:40.800
The keys are in the ignition the car is running truck is running. Oh are you talking to me? No I was talking to Keith Vigna is he available? Sorry. Well from my screen it looked like you were looking at Joe but anyway.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:56.800
You guys were at 45 and not 90? Yeah you should be looking up to talk to me. You weren't effectively Brady bunching those calls.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:05.800
Yeah I just open the door I get the keys turn the truck off and stick them in one of my pockets and I zip the pocket up.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:28.800
Clark Bishop you are looking inside this house Terence liquor is standing oil stained hands ripped flannel shirt long oily hair underneath a trucker cap he's got some dirty overalls and boots and he's standing in like the living room of this house where you see Randy Angst.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:44.800
He is wearing a fancy blue three-piece suit you can't tell it's a three-piece suit though because he is being shoved face into the carpet by Terence or not. Not Terence. Oh shit.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:02:07.800

There's this burly thick short dude who has his knee on the back of Randy Angst's neck and he is shoving Randy's face into the carpet and then you hear the truck stop running they hear the truck stop running and they look up well seems like we've got some company.

What's up everybody I'm Zach and I just wanted to pop in at the end here and holler a few things at y'all first sorry this episode was so so so late I absolutely love making this show but it takes an absurd amount of time and I've been running low on steam.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:33.800
With that being said I'm gonna take a week off I'm tired and I need a bit of a reset during all this uncertainty and constant low-grade panic so episode 80 will be out on Friday May 29th and we will then resume our weekly release schedule.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:46.800
Thank you all for understanding this community is incredible and the only messages I received about this episode being late were positive and encouraging. Seriously y'all are the best.
