05:54.060 --> 06:01.180
was filmed you were right luke it was good that we discussed that on the podcast instead of before

06:01.180 --> 06:08.860
we recorded well i just wanted something to say i think he said he had multiple things to say

06:08.860 --> 06:16.460
about the documentary well i ended up looking up who that guy was so we've gotten the first one

06:16.460 --> 06:23.660
oh oh one b so part two of the first thing who is the skiff fellow i uh don't remember his name

06:23.660 --> 06:29.260
but he was like worked security for the for the united center and that was it that's all i could

06:29.260 --> 06:40.700
find about him wow we've struck gold once again luke that's still your first thing really detective

06:40.700 --> 06:46.460
luke is on the case he just blew vape smoke directly into his camera as if to put it in

06:46.460 --> 06:52.380
each of our faces simultaneously and put a lovely point on the uh had i not said let's

06:52.380 --> 06:58.540
record this on the podcast we would still not be recording the podcast and that's a very good

06:58.540 --> 07:03.900
true yeah he engineered it he made it happen he hacked us all and some would argue we're not

07:03.900 --> 07:11.420
recording the podcast yet only if it takes it in are we technically recording the podcast

07:14.380 --> 07:20.060

08:08.060 --> 08:12.780
covering the front door with my gun the last episode i was headphones off for a good portion

08:12.780 --> 08:17.420
at the end so i don't know how things have progressed from there judge ephraim courtland

08:17.500 --> 08:24.460
had gone in after silas kohl who went in handcuffed you haven't heard anything

08:24.460 --> 08:30.540
since i believe you failed some listen world and you have your gun trained at the door jack

08:30.540 --> 08:38.300
pearlman what is the in the words of the name on our zoom call sex icon and probably dead soon

08:38.300 --> 08:49.660
character doing i have a one hp and not much sanity and i believe i failed my first aid

08:49.660 --> 08:54.940
role on myself so i just like oh yeah you hurt yourself i think i hurt myself even more yeah

08:54.940 --> 09:00.220
and i'm just like on the ground i don't i don't with one hp am i able to like do anything or am

09:00.220 --> 09:07.260
i like i'm down on the ground yeah no absolutely because you succeeded on your constitution check

09:07.260 --> 09:12.860
you don't have any mechanical disadvantages toward you currently based on the way that

09:13.500 --> 09:19.660
i like playing this game cool okay good to know i mean if you try to sprint after someone i'll

09:19.660 --> 09:24.860
probably be like hey maybe take a massive negative yes yeah yeah besides that what's professor horse

09:24.860 --> 09:30.940
green doing i don't know where are we yes that is correct that was my question for you

09:31.580 --> 09:37.260
yeah no one answered no i'm covering the door and he's injured outside the door

09:37.260 --> 09:43.500
right yard of this the coal home i think you're also injured next to me no i'm very hurt i know

09:43.500 --> 09:49.900
that but i got a little healing so i'm yes i was i was close to dead no i'm not you just blew the

09:49.900 --> 09:56.700
brains like you just blew the head off of the preacher doctor sheriff bobby custard right but

09:56.700 --> 10:01.580
i didn't see it so i missed the sanity and you're the only one who didn't lose sanity

10:03.340 --> 10:11.020
so horace horace shouts uh by god maybe he'll listen to the law or a man of god where's the

10:11.020 --> 10:18.620
preacher sheriff he just starts reaching around him trying to feel out for the the preacher

10:18.620 --> 10:23.260
sheriff everett is not going to look back but just kind of gesture back to where the body is

10:23.260 --> 10:28.620
you done nailed him you done nailed him and you're gesturing to the back of the wagon where his body

10:28.620 --> 10:35.740
flew but the head is sitting about 10 feet away from horace green on the ground where it landed

10:35.740 --> 10:43.740
with a thump and if you were golfing you would have to fix the divot that the head made when

10:43.740 --> 10:50.300
it landed initially in the dirt horace green vomits good heavens

10:55.900 --> 11:03.340
pearlman's just clinching his his leg and he's just like god damn it but somehow due to his

11:03.340 --> 11:09.180
his sex icon status i think is really powering to stand up because you can't be sexy while you're

11:09.180 --> 11:13.100
bleeding on the ground i thought you're gonna say sitting down or sitting down

11:15.580 --> 11:23.580
zack trust me no one's ever looked sexy sitting in a chair ever or sitting on the ground or

11:23.580 --> 11:29.660
laying down has anyone ever been sexy laying in a bed i'm looking at five really sexy dudes

11:29.660 --> 11:36.620
sitting in chairs right now we should record the show standing maybe oh no i think the vibe change

11:36.940 --> 11:42.140
the people couldn't handle that there'd be way too much chaotic energy happening if

11:42.140 --> 11:46.060
i we weren't bound to our chairs over each other more sorry i stood for a second

11:49.500 --> 11:56.460
god damn it i i have to download these files luke no you don't you literally don't like it's not a

11:56.460 --> 12:01.980
rule that you have to look at what luke sends us over the chat while we're recording minions

12:01.980 --> 12:07.420
pornography it's true it's it's not a rule but luke if you want people to look at them you need

12:07.420 --> 12:10.780
to send a link or something because these make you download the file and i'm not gonna do that

12:10.780 --> 12:16.940

13:05.820 --> 13:11.740
calling that yeah when we started birding to get him to come back he blew the smoke directly into

13:11.740 --> 13:18.140

15:21.740 --> 15:30.380
humans all right everybody else taking their headphones off so judge ephraim courtland having

15:30.380 --> 15:39.260
just been removed from his own body and replaced with mary mary cole you are in the bedroom silas

15:39.260 --> 15:46.780
coal is still handcuffed he was hiding behind a turned over bed however now he is uh still behind

15:46.780 --> 15:54.860
the bed and still in handcuffs but he's not cowering in fear he's now crouching in concentration

15:54.860 --> 16:03.020
focusing deeply on the words he is chanting into this disheveled bedroom a beaming light forms on

16:03.020 --> 16:11.820
his lips and a white hot blaze of color begins dripping down viscous and alive and it puddles

16:11.820 --> 16:19.660
beneath silas cole's chanting mouth onto the dusty floor below before flowing gently toward the far

16:19.660 --> 16:28.460
side of the room okay luke you can also see as mary cole there's an oily black substance leaking

16:28.460 --> 16:36.620
from your facial orifices you can kind of feel it like a like a perpetual runny nose and eyes

16:36.620 --> 16:45.020
and ears and mouth and this squamous eye core seems to almost pull itself down to the ground

16:45.020 --> 16:51.340
where this mesmerizing brilliant light has pooled between the two doors of this room

16:52.300 --> 16:58.940
the syrup made out of the absence of color that just came out of you begins swirling into its

16:58.940 --> 17:06.380
opposite and the two unnatural ungodly glass-forming liquids at first refuse to blend

17:06.380 --> 17:14.860
like oil and vinegar but then the most beautiful awe-inspiring color you've ever seen forms from

17:14.940 --> 17:22.140
this bond and another equally mind-shattering color joins it and another and another and now

17:22.140 --> 17:28.140
the old wooden floor on the far side of this bedroom between the only two doors

17:28.140 --> 17:34.380
is covered jam to jam with a perversely extraordinary technicolor portal

17:34.540 --> 17:48.060
right so i'm gonna go over and take the handcuffs off of silas look at him and be like okay i'm gonna

17:48.060 --> 17:56.220
lead him in here just be ready for him wide-eyed silas is just nodding uh ephraim steps over the

17:56.220 --> 18:02.140
portal carefully and opens the door shuts it behind him and as he enters back into the living

18:02.140 --> 18:06.700

as ever at pace and jack promen have their guns set on the front door and professor horace green

19:54.220 --> 20:03.100

doctor pastored preacher sheriff doctor bobby custard which is on the ground about 10 feet

20:08.940 --> 20:15.260

20:15.980 --> 20:23.740

20:23.740 --> 20:29.820
are the only ones out here you no longer find the wild crazed teenager

20:30.460 --> 20:39.740
like one of those teenagers at one of those concerts that you might find just wild smoking

20:39.740 --> 20:45.180
reaper oh my god can you even imagine that's probably what made her this way every every uh

20:45.180 --> 20:50.380

20:53.020 --> 20:58.460
i come outside and look and see the head and i just look at them like what

20:58.860 --> 21:06.540

21:27.020 --> 21:33.980
one of the one of the other rooms but ephraim what happened out here what's got you so shaken

21:33.980 --> 21:42.060

21:42.060 --> 21:50.300
come see it horace horace i walk over to horace horace has reached uh has reached the head

21:51.100 --> 21:56.620
and he's just grabbed it by the hair and he's looking it in the eyes horace now i know you

21:56.700 --> 22:01.180
ain't much for fighting but sometimes things just happen in battle you can't you can't always

22:01.180 --> 22:05.980
predict it i've been in plenty of bar fights where i accidentally punched some fellers i

22:05.980 --> 22:10.540
didn't mean to and when you throw guns in the mix you just know you're asking for trouble it ain't

22:10.540 --> 22:16.860
your fault so just to if you could if you could put the head down and and we might need you in

22:16.860 --> 22:23.260
here but there's there's things happening so if you put it down of of course of course we're

22:23.260 --> 22:27.340
needed inside and he takes he doesn't put the head down he carries it with him

22:31.180 --> 22:32.860
it's right through here boys

22:35.100 --> 22:38.140
excuse me right through here

22:41.100 --> 22:47.420
and i just kind of point to the first room inside i'll carefully start dottering up but i want to

22:47.420 --> 22:52.060
keep my gun kind of at the ready i'm not pointing at anything in particular but i could if i needed

22:52.060 --> 22:57.580
to and i'm cautious about it all every night doing so hot if you want to take lead i'll back

22:57.580 --> 23:04.300
you up though as i'm i assume i'm like dripping blood all over the place at this point 100

23:04.300 --> 23:09.980
professor horace green is also dripping blood from the head he's carrying are you carrying it

23:09.980 --> 23:15.820
with you into the home with two hands or by the hair with one hand or you buy the hair with one

23:15.820 --> 23:26.060
hand uh-huh why just curious uh horace green doesn't he doesn't hear that question

23:28.060 --> 23:34.620
no yeah i'm asking thomas i guess what's going on inside professor horace green's

23:34.620 --> 23:37.980
mind well it's because this is a comedy podcast and that's hilarious

23:37.980 --> 23:47.020
yeah i don't know why you're slowing it down like this sack

23:47.020 --> 23:50.460
oh i was thinking that we could have like a good character moment

23:50.460 --> 23:52.780
you're you're interrupting a good character moment

23:56.140 --> 23:58.940
he's dazed carrying a head around and not saying anything

24:00.460 --> 24:05.420
he's busy downloading my pictures of wasniac that won't make sense because i'll have edited

24:07.980 --> 24:18.620
it as the three of you head in specifically horace green uh the smell of rotten flesh

24:19.500 --> 24:26.460
is the first thing you notice as you pass through the swinging open front door of the whole abode

24:26.460 --> 24:32.460
at first you think the stench could be from the unattended dishes strewn throughout this living

24:32.540 --> 24:40.700
room the remnants of several meals now covered in a few buzzing flies but that static hum of flies

24:40.700 --> 24:47.980
it's so loud in your ears and looking over you see that that is due to the large swarm hovering

24:47.980 --> 24:54.700
about the body of miss kitty which is laying lifeless across one of the sitting chairs

24:55.340 --> 25:02.780
lifeless to be sure because this body the skin is chewed up so badly that chunks are hanging off

25:02.780 --> 25:11.740
or completely missing and the dripping dark red blood pooling below on the floor but especially

25:11.740 --> 25:20.860
lifeless due to the way this body is crumpled her back held directly in the middle by one of

25:20.860 --> 25:29.740
the armrests there's an unnatural angle there as the top half of her torso dangles straight down

25:30.620 --> 25:35.500
perpendicular to the floor i'll never get a chance to string her up now

25:38.540 --> 25:44.140
uh go ahead and roll sanity for me pace pearlman and green oh god my dice

26:05.660 --> 26:07.660
i heard it here coins in a glass

26:10.220 --> 26:10.940
what's happening

26:10.940 --> 26:18.380
what was that nice putting all the other dice away because i spilled them all out like an idiot

26:19.900 --> 26:22.700
just wanted you guys to pretend like you didn't notice for once

26:23.580 --> 26:27.500

26:59.100 --> 27:05.900
hey um do you want to do uh do you want me to fail a sanity test earlier on when i see the

27:05.900 --> 27:10.620
head or something that is why i to give that a little more omph yeah i just figured it's it's

27:10.620 --> 27:16.060
delta green let's get weird with it but he would be emotionally devastated exactly that's all i

27:16.060 --> 27:22.220
wanted you to say earlier so okay hold on hold on hold on real quick hold on roll sanity you said

27:22.300 --> 27:27.020
88 that's a critical failure

27:36.780 --> 27:41.020
i think he's gonna fix it on that head

27:41.020 --> 27:47.820
so

27:56.300 --> 28:03.340
horse green jack pearlman judge ephraim courtland the three of you hear a slight murmur

28:03.340 --> 28:05.820
from the next room deeper into this house

28:11.980 --> 28:22.620
bob he's oh i chased him in there and he's uh tied up but he's been yet just saying those

28:22.620 --> 28:29.020
mumble words over and over again which room's he in do we know a bob the one that you got

28:29.020 --> 28:35.580
right there horace holds the head up and looks at it quizzically i don't think he'll like this

28:36.220 --> 28:39.660
this is the first time ever he's noticed that you've brought the head in with you

28:39.660 --> 28:44.220
what the hell you why are you holding up the head you should have just left that outside what

28:44.220 --> 28:49.900
are you why'd you bring a head in it what's going on here horse so he can see he's dead horse he's

28:49.900 --> 28:58.140
dead he killed him okay professor horse green starts laughing no no no yeah no he doesn't

28:59.100 --> 29:05.340
horace looks really confused and he looks at you and he looks at the head and then he moves the

29:05.340 --> 29:12.300
jaw holy shit and he's like i'm not dead oh my god

29:14.940 --> 29:21.340
ever ever exchanges a glance with like jack pearlman but it's not of like scared it's just

29:21.340 --> 29:32.460
like well we lost one i guess uh jack just shrugs yep you're getting the floors dirty with all that

29:32.460 --> 29:38.940
blood there i don't horse if you could put a napkin under bobby that would be he's dripping

29:38.940 --> 29:46.380
he's causing me oh my oh my how how rude and horace takes off his um his handkerchief and

29:46.380 --> 29:53.740
ties it around the stump on the neck i don't think you're gonna be making much more of a mess

29:53.740 --> 29:58.540
that's already in here those other two rooms ain't too ain't too good either well it ain't

29:58.540 --> 30:07.900
proper for a head not to be covered on the bottom i think he's quite dashing now aren't you yes i am

30:11.500 --> 30:19.260
why are you all looking at me like that maybe we should continue upon our our our business here and

30:19.260 --> 30:25.740
talk to horace about some stuff later yeah well if we i think i hear him still chanting in there but

30:26.540 --> 30:34.300
uh he's just passed in through those doors what did you do to him i just i got him

30:34.300 --> 30:43.900
beat up pretty good and i got him hogtied and and and cuffed up and he's just i don't know i might

30:43.900 --> 30:48.460
have hit him in the head too hard or something what do you reckon he killed his kitty for i i

30:48.460 --> 30:54.140
didn't really have time to find out i just kind of lost it on him and then uh came to see what

30:54.140 --> 31:00.620
you guys were doing i'm you know didn't want to do it alone you think maybe she was breaking into

31:00.620 --> 31:04.460
his house last night and that's he must have caught her that's that's got to be what happened

31:04.460 --> 31:09.660
could be why to keep her inside though he didn't he didn't mention her back at the at the church

31:09.660 --> 31:13.420
seems like that something he would have never liked silas maybe he stole something from her

31:13.420 --> 31:20.460
like he stole something from me but what do you think happened teddy i think the zombie girl

31:20.460 --> 31:28.220
later oh well now that's a thought perhaps what do you guys think maybe we ought to just go ask

31:28.220 --> 31:34.220
him yeah i think it's best we talk to silas cole face to face right man figure this all out if you

31:34.220 --> 31:39.740
want to lead the way go ahead because i feel like i'm gonna lose it on him again if i go in there

31:39.740 --> 31:46.060
first and can't promise he'll have much to say after i get to him any of us check if mary's here

31:46.060 --> 31:52.860

39:15.500 --> 39:23.100
magnificent technicolor swirl of light covering the part of the floor in this room that's

39:23.100 --> 39:30.220
immediately in front of you it's likely the most beautiful thing you have ever seen and yet there

portal horse green with this head in one of your hands you step down into nothingness

40:02.380 --> 40:06.860
and immediately you feel content

40:10.380 --> 40:16.860
that's all i can say at this time oh dang did i just turn myself into a tilde zombie i can't

40:16.860 --> 40:23.340
answer that question currently well a zombie with a zombie with a little head buddy would

40:23.340 --> 40:31.500
be really funny it would be very fun all right so you can uh you can leave the zoom call if you

40:31.500 --> 40:37.500
want honestly okay i'll stay i mean i'll be by my phone so yeah you can hang out on the zoom call

40:37.500 --> 40:42.380
but stay by your phone and oh yeah i'll just watch you guys yeah there you go uh okay

40:51.420 --> 40:57.180
ever paste jack pearlman judge ephraim courtland the three of you see professor horace green walk

40:57.180 --> 41:05.020
into the room however you are at a current angle where you are right now walking towards this door

41:05.020 --> 41:10.620
to where you can't quite see where he went once he got into the room and you can't really see

41:10.620 --> 41:18.300
into the room quite yet into the next room where silas is exactly okay and ever at pace it is your

41:18.300 --> 41:27.660
turn the fact that we're in turn order would make joe nervous but ever it's just walking in to see

41:27.660 --> 41:34.620
where judge ephraim courtland tied up silas i think ever pace would be nervous due to the odd

41:34.620 --> 41:42.380
chanting that you can now hear coming from this room that you know is silas cole who is apparently

41:42.380 --> 41:50.940
tied up hogtied uh who is saying bob da hahaha bob da hahaha bob da hahaha and with the door

41:50.940 --> 41:56.220
open you can hear it quite clearly and there's that body that was all munched up on i kind of

41:56.220 --> 42:02.220
stop when i hear wait what oh the miss kitty you mean yeah yeah there's reasons to be uh nervous

42:03.260 --> 42:08.380
not forever namely everything that's just a chewed up body ain't nothing here now found

42:08.380 --> 42:16.300
miss kitty she's dead that sucks so it goes but mission accomplished he hears uh he hears the

42:16.300 --> 42:21.260
chanting and stops and listens for a second and kind of looks back at judge and pearlman

42:22.220 --> 42:27.820
bob da hahaha ring a bell for anybody bob da hahaha is he is he in town you think he's a relation

42:27.820 --> 42:32.620
or something maybe it's his lawyer he needs his lawyer bob da hahaha maybe i i don't know judge

42:32.620 --> 42:37.900
is there a is there a lawyer in town bob da hahaha i think i've dealt with him once or twice

42:38.460 --> 42:42.380
that's what it is he's gonna need a good lawyer for this one and i keep walking in

42:45.580 --> 42:48.860
uh yeah justin and luke take off your headphones real quick for me

42:58.140 --> 43:06.140
joe as you walk toward the open door you see a technicolor swirl has taken over the entirety

43:06.140 --> 43:13.740
of the floor right is you where you're about to walk in on i need you to roll a sanity check as

43:13.740 --> 43:21.980
all of these rainbow colors just wash back and forth in a circle around where your next step

43:21.980 --> 43:30.620
might be i pass a 16 on a 78 you lose no sanity ever wants to look up at the ceiling to see what's

43:30.620 --> 43:36.540
projecting this down onto the floor there's nothing up on the ceiling that would affect

43:37.100 --> 43:41.100
what is happening here on the floor does anything change with my step

43:41.820 --> 43:46.700
like into like onto it do you step onto it i thought you said i did you don't have to

43:48.780 --> 43:55.020
well fuck i think i think since he didn't pass a since he passed a sanity role he doesn't he's

43:55.020 --> 43:59.020
not too worried about it he just thinks that a pretty light show going on in here somehow

43:59.020 --> 44:04.860
there must be a stained glass revolving uh candle lit thing and as that first step goes down you

44:04.860 --> 44:12.700
feel your foot continue to move through the floor as ever it pays trips and falls face first into

44:12.700 --> 44:21.980
this technicolor swirl and you feel your body become wholly content in this moment welcome

44:21.980 --> 44:31.660
evert professor horace green says to you in a space of pure darkness and somehow at the same

44:31.660 --> 44:46.220
time completely technicolor welcome evert horse is that you yes eddie's here too oh you you

44:46.220 --> 44:52.780
brought the you brought the head with you too all right where are we who cares doesn't it feel great

44:53.900 --> 45:02.460
yeah i mean i don't know if i ever experienced a time when i was so it just it's relaxing i guess

45:02.460 --> 45:07.980
and the two of you are just falling but you're falling up seemingly you reckon you think we're

45:07.980 --> 45:13.020
on our way up to the big man in the sky i think that's probably what this is what do you think

45:13.020 --> 45:16.620
happened you think we we must have stepped in a bear trap got us got us through an artery or

45:16.620 --> 45:22.220
something in that room to me it looked like a beautiful gateway to an ascendant plane

45:22.220 --> 45:27.100
that's what i saw too that must have been the last drags of the blood leaving our body and

45:27.100 --> 45:32.460
making our brains see the something that would give us comfort in our final moments evert uh

45:33.100 --> 45:41.100
normally i'm a man of of reason and science but uh well science never made me feel like this

45:41.100 --> 45:47.660
i think probably we just yeah we died you're right yep we died don't question it we're going

45:47.660 --> 45:56.620
to heaven this is great uh just enjoy this this falling upwards as it were clara here i come

45:56.620 --> 46:03.980
and above you you see only darkness it'll take me a minute i don't even see the light yet but

46:03.980 --> 46:20.220
i'll be there jack promen yeah hey man hey it's your turn uh i'm following evert into the into the

46:20.220 --> 46:27.260
thing gun out and as you walk up to the door that is slightly open that both professor horse green

46:27.260 --> 46:36.540
and evert pace have walked through you see on the floor an incredible swirl of technicolor

46:36.540 --> 46:44.460
vibrancy just washing about in circles around and around the floor and i need you to roll sanity for

46:44.460 --> 46:51.420
me but it's so party it is but it is crazy as hell oh 51 yeah on a 39 it'd be cool if i could

46:51.420 --> 46:56.140
pass one sanity check well with a failed sanity check

46:58.780 --> 47:04.060
you're going to be at a negative depending on what you want to do here okay but looking into

47:04.060 --> 47:10.060
this room uh you just see the majority of this floor about half the room is covered in this

47:10.060 --> 47:19.020
gorgeous rainbow colored swirl like light that is mesmerizing light like bioluminescence or whatever

47:19.020 --> 47:25.580
you do not see ever at pace you do not see professor horse green you only see

47:25.580 --> 47:30.220
a bed that is flipped over and from behind it you hear

47:32.380 --> 47:40.300
silas what the hell are you chanting that for who's bob to hob and i guess i'll have you roll

47:40.300 --> 47:49.980
a dexterity at a negative 20 to keep your footing as you enter into this room negative 20 because

47:49.980 --> 47:56.940
you failed you're saying fuck 29 on a 25 so close that'll do it as you uh

47:59.740 --> 48:06.220
as your foot steps into this room without being able to make the jump

48:06.780 --> 48:13.980
over it or stop yourself from stepping onto it your foot moves through the floor

48:14.940 --> 48:24.940
and you begin falling through this technicolor swirl of a portal and you begin falling upward

48:24.940 --> 48:34.940
and upward and you feel completely content physically oh that sounds nice except for

48:34.940 --> 48:40.460
the part where i'm in an endless hell of some kind yes it is complete darkness and at the

48:40.460 --> 48:47.340
exact same time every color you've ever seen swirling around you and above you there's nothing

48:47.340 --> 48:53.580
but the absence of light and the bodies of ever at pace and professor horse green who are having

48:53.580 --> 49:00.220
a perfectly normal conversation oh shit jack did the bear trap get you too we just all plumb ran

49:00.220 --> 49:07.180
into it didn't we hello jack um long story short we're probably in heaven uh i don't want to get

49:07.180 --> 49:11.500
too into it because we're probably gonna have to do this again with the judge really quickly here

49:11.500 --> 49:17.340
so uh but if you could if if you can just wait if you could just wait wait we're gonna get to

49:17.340 --> 49:28.540
it in just a moment i'm sure we'll answer all your questions and you wait and you wait

49:30.860 --> 49:36.300
and the judge does not come oh thank god the judge must have skipped over that bear trap in

49:36.300 --> 49:42.380
that room kind of bear trap sends you into another goddamn i guess it could have been some kind of

49:42.380 --> 49:46.220
trap that fell from the ceiling but either way something killed us as soon as we walked in the

49:46.220 --> 49:51.340
room and now we're on our way up to heaven most likely you sure we're dead can i touch ever at

49:51.340 --> 49:57.260
pace's face like i put my hand out to touch his face like face off where i go yeah and touch his

49:58.060 --> 50:04.220
face you're asking a lot of questions for a content person you're kind of ruining the vibe

50:04.220 --> 50:12.700
here man when i when i reach out to touch his face do i feel it feels like someone else's hand

50:12.700 --> 50:19.740
is touching his face yep jack it's me oh but that feels right to you well i don't know what we can

50:19.740 --> 50:25.580
do did you all try looking around are we walking right now are we like floating we're floating up

50:25.580 --> 50:31.100
we're going to heaven it's just a matter of time when jack says that though ever it's like hey i

50:31.100 --> 50:35.820
didn't i didn't try that and he puts his arm behind him and tries to get momentum in one

50:35.820 --> 50:41.740
direction or another see if he can move through the air i feel so graceful i've never felt this

50:41.740 --> 50:47.500
graceful not for not for 50 years at least seemingly out of nowhere the three of you are

50:47.500 --> 50:54.460
sitting on the ground above you is pure darkness the same darkness that you've seen above you this

50:54.460 --> 51:04.940
entire time and beneath you the ground is made of pure light well it would appear we've made it

51:07.020 --> 51:08.460
holy fuck sack

51:11.340 --> 51:17.340
yeah i thought there'd be more clouds and harps do you think jesus is up here jesus

51:17.420 --> 51:25.500
jesus jesus you here jesus me every jesus you come out now jesus jesus

51:27.100 --> 51:35.580
and as professor horace green opens and closes the jaw of the decapitated head

51:36.300 --> 51:42.460
of preacher sheriff dr bobby custard as he's jeff dunham's jesus

51:42.460 --> 51:49.180
that's right that's right that's what i think of you professor horace green

51:56.300 --> 52:00.540
the biggest insult i can think of you belong in the gutter

52:03.260 --> 52:12.060
the eyes of preacher sheriff dr decapitated head bobby custard open and then the camera pans down

52:12.540 --> 52:33.820
into the bright pure light and as the camera pans down into this bright white light it begins

52:33.820 --> 52:41.660
traveling through this technicolor cylinder and on the other side goes up into the bedroom

52:42.700 --> 52:48.860
of silas and mary cole moves directly up to the face of judge ephraim

52:49.740 --> 52:54.860
courtland uh well silas that was a hell of a lot easier than i thought it was gonna be

53:01.100 --> 53:11.340
oh fuck you holy shit chanting stops the technicolor swirl on the floor dissipates

53:12.060 --> 53:19.020
and silas pushes the bed back over into its horizontal position and he rushes

53:19.020 --> 53:26.140
to judge ephraim courtland and throws his arms around the back of his neck

53:26.860 --> 53:34.140
judge ephraim courtland places his lips right on silas's mouth and a deep deep kiss

53:35.100 --> 53:43.980
holy shit and silas cole pulls back and says i love you mary

53:46.780 --> 53:57.260
what the fuck back i love you too silas oh my god so i can never trust any of you again

53:58.140 --> 54:00.780
like in a zack game

54:03.260 --> 54:07.580
i was like okay i'll just get them in here i'll probably have to fight them into the portal

54:14.620 --> 54:18.380

56:16.540 --> 56:22.540
game of roll for shoes set in a very goofy outer space if you've enjoyed this show so far i would

56:22.540 --> 56:27.980
really love it if you could take a minute to leave a review on apple podcasts follow us on

56:27.980 --> 56:34.780
twitter and instagram or i don't know maybe go and make a post on reddit recommending our lunacy

56:34.780 --> 56:41.500
