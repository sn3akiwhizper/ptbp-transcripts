02:35.600 --> 02:44.080
backbone

02:52.000 --> 02:58.640
so all three of you are going up to room 202 what do you want to do just open it up no knock it's a

02:58.640 --> 03:06.640
me and what are the two of you guys doing oh i i had a backup gun right i i got a walkie-talkie

03:06.640 --> 03:13.040
gun and everything back is that correct what gun did you grab because you lost your small powerful

03:13.040 --> 03:19.120
gun i did wait i thought i just had my regular pistol gun my my that's a madman with a noisy

03:19.120 --> 03:24.960
cricket well it's a small extremely powerful that's the one he stole i thought he just stole

03:24.960 --> 03:31.440
like my i would assume that you always had that on you oh see i wasn't assuming that as well as

03:31.440 --> 03:35.520
your police firearm i thought the yeah so you still look for it though like i feel like you'd

03:35.520 --> 03:40.880
go for the surface revolver so he has both of my okay how about this not i don't i thought that

03:40.880 --> 03:46.240
that gun was still in like lock up you can leave it in lock up and he just stole your police side

03:46.240 --> 03:51.440
okay well so then i guess i have that gun on me because it was the only other pistol that i could

03:51.440 --> 03:56.480
get so i have that yeah i didn't think we were fucking with our crazy shit yet more than welcome

03:56.480 --> 04:04.240
well now i have to use it because you know i don't have another police gun if you didn't want to we

04:04.240 --> 04:12.880

06:23.360 --> 06:29.680
when you put your hand on your gun she puts her hand under the pillow to the right of her

06:30.400 --> 06:35.680
i said i am a police officer not the tooth fairy get your hand out from under that pillow right now

06:36.640 --> 06:42.240

06:42.240 --> 06:52.160
behind him gun drawn gun drawn gun drawn uh but still behind keith okay so keith she immediately

06:52.160 --> 06:57.440
just like wings her arm at you she's she's throwing an object at you uh what do you want

06:57.440 --> 07:01.440

07:01.520 --> 07:05.040
quick of a motion uh go ahead and roll alertness for me

07:08.000 --> 07:15.040
nice zero that's the bad one i got a hundred oh then you have no chance of dodging out of the way

07:15.040 --> 07:25.600
so let's see if she passes her athletics role she does yay i'm so excited we thought you were cool

07:26.000 --> 07:35.600
lady uh only rolled a one on damage however so keith you look away for like

07:35.600 --> 07:45.040
half a second and all of a sudden there's a knife sticking in your um arm just like right

07:45.920 --> 07:51.760
just like on your forearm like a how big of a knife it's a it's a small knife about six inches

07:51.760 --> 07:57.120
long and sticking all the like all the way through my arm or what no it actually just

07:57.120 --> 08:01.680
like under the skin yeah it didn't it didn't get in very deep it kind of went in at a weird angle

08:02.240 --> 08:08.320
uh so it didn't mess with any tendons or anything hell yeah uh but you do take one damage okay i did

08:08.320 --> 08:13.920
already i look down at it and i look up at her in the moments between or not between but as soon as

08:13.920 --> 08:21.360
the knife is in his arm sure i've registered as such yeah what is she doing so she immediately

08:21.360 --> 08:28.960
is reaching back under and throws another at clark bishop okay so how are you handling

08:28.960 --> 08:34.720
that situation there's a knife being thrown at you currently i had the gun pulled i want to just fire

08:34.720 --> 08:40.960
okay sounds good can i can i try to uh you can't grab the knife out of the air there's no one in

08:40.960 --> 08:49.680
this town no this is fucking america like i'm gonna get lit the fuck up are you going for a

08:49.680 --> 08:57.760
kill shot or purpose i mean i'm not but it might happen you can try to avoid a kill shot at an at

08:57.760 --> 09:02.800
a penalty you can aim for a specific uh you know like a called shot is that the one yeah it's a

09:02.800 --> 09:08.720
called shot so you would take a negative 20 on your firearms check to do less damage what is

09:08.720 --> 09:13.440
that's what i want to do so my firearms is normally 80 so i'm rolling at a 60 right now correct

09:13.440 --> 09:23.120
i pass crit pass crit pass ones just a single one yeah dude these are new these are different

09:23.120 --> 09:29.440
dice too yep that we have been rolling high yeah they've been rolling shitty yeah oh my god okay

09:29.440 --> 09:32.880
clark where do you want to shoot her in the throwing arm the arm that she was reaching back

09:32.880 --> 09:38.560
under the pillow with that's perfect literally uh as she starts to fling an object you shoot her in

09:38.560 --> 09:47.920
the hand and the knife just drops onto the bed next to her and she is going to uh roll over

09:47.920 --> 09:53.840
off to the left side of the bed and john it is your turn what do you do you heard a uh gunshot

09:53.840 --> 10:00.720
just now uh yeah i just like i slide in on my knees between keith and clark through the door

10:00.800 --> 10:05.440
and i've just got my drunk gone drawn gone got my gun drawn

10:08.240 --> 10:13.760
are you just gonna make us kill everybody like i've set up i've set up characters in specific

10:13.760 --> 10:19.760
locations doing specific things why do they all attack cops this is america like we have to shoot

10:19.760 --> 10:28.800
them you don't have to but you do i mean you can do it however you want however some of these

10:28.800 --> 10:35.440
people are extremely aggressive and have things that they need to do i guess they don't think much

10:35.440 --> 10:40.960
of the contention after i take my shot can i just say i winged her so that you know that i've at

10:40.960 --> 10:46.400
least got her i mean like yeah i slide through the door and i'm like don't you move a fucking muscle

10:46.400 --> 10:52.800
okay cool does she move a muscle she doesn't you can see the top of her head like she's on the far

10:52.800 --> 10:57.040
side of the bed but you can see the top of her head peeking over hands in the air right fucking

10:57.040 --> 11:02.400
now slowly raise your hands she slowly raises her hands in the air is there anything in them

11:03.760 --> 11:10.320
yeah there's a lead pipe in one of her hands drop the pipe fonzie okay

11:11.600 --> 11:17.760
she does not drop the pipe and keith it's your turn i pull the knife out of my hand or out of

11:17.760 --> 11:21.840
my arm try to stab her in the arm with it to make her drop the pipe

11:21.840 --> 11:28.880
so you've got a gun and she's got a pipe but i got a real powerful gun i don't not trying to

11:29.440 --> 11:36.640
unleash this shit yet i'm doing it she i'm she's facing away from us right i would say based on

11:36.640 --> 11:43.280
where you are in the room because i picture you kind of where the tv is and then she is to like

11:43.280 --> 11:48.560
if you walked in the room the bed's on the left tv's right in front of you facing to the left

11:49.280 --> 11:54.560
tv's right in front of you facing to the left and she's on the other side of the bed and you're

11:54.560 --> 11:59.200
standing there so you can kind of see her at a side angle yeah i want to try to like slice at her

11:59.200 --> 12:04.480
hand that's holding the pipe and then like pin her down on the ground okay go ahead and roll melee

12:06.160 --> 12:16.160
i do not pass yeah she crit succeeds so as you swipe with a knife she immediately

12:16.160 --> 12:23.520
like uses your momentum against you and holds the knife to your throat and she's got you hostage

12:23.520 --> 12:32.960
and so it is clark's turn uh help me ma'am ma'am hey whoa hey don't do it uh hey don't do it i'll

12:32.960 --> 12:39.600
fucking kill him uh we uh we're just here uh to ask you questions and you started slinging knives

12:39.600 --> 12:45.440
at us i mean he pulled his gun oh i think he was thinking about pulling his gun because you

12:45.440 --> 12:51.920
weren't talking i don't like him nobody really does uh unfortunately we're partial to him so

12:51.920 --> 12:58.560
i need you to let him go and then can i roll a persuade on just that yeah absolutely i mean

12:58.560 --> 13:04.320
it's gonna be very hard to get her to just let him go but okay sure roll persuade

13:04.320 --> 13:16.000
oh what the fuck awesome i watched it happen with my eyes just rolled an ott one i rolled a one

13:16.000 --> 13:20.320
again how many ones have you rolled i was about to say through this campaign i've done it a bunch

13:20.320 --> 13:25.120
it's and i'm using different dice every time i promise have you done a bunch i have that's the

13:25.120 --> 13:31.200
fourth at least the fourth yeah and two of them have been going back to back that's shots that's

13:31.200 --> 13:34.240
that's the note right there wait what are you trying oh you're persuading i was just trying

13:34.240 --> 13:43.760
to get her to let you go without doing anything else how about this i won't i'm sorry i won't

13:43.760 --> 13:50.960
kill him and i'll let him go if you let me go tell the tell her that's okay tell her that's

13:50.960 --> 13:57.520
okay come on do you know what happens when a one is rolled you're in no position to negotiate i

13:57.520 --> 14:03.040
mean if you want to ari like i i just don't see literally any possible way that she's just going

14:03.040 --> 14:06.800
to be like after hurting a police after like hurting a police officer that she's just going

14:06.800 --> 14:13.120
to let him go and be like yeah have me well but then what does a one get you she's willing to

14:13.120 --> 14:19.120
slice keith's throat currently so makes her stop i would why what but there's no way we're letting

14:19.120 --> 14:24.080
her go sure that makes sense to her though i mean that's easy to do but then we're just fighting her

14:24.160 --> 14:28.720
again but without keith being right there yeah i think this woman would have been dead from the

14:28.720 --> 14:33.600
second she fucking threw a knife in your arm at this point she doesn't seem to have like a firearm

14:33.600 --> 14:38.800
and we are at the entrance to the motel so we could just like let her go and then just i mean

14:38.800 --> 14:44.160
what is she's not gonna escape ma'am uh we're amiable for that can we just ask you a question

14:44.160 --> 14:51.520
or two before you go i will allow that as she motions the two of you into the corner opposite

14:51.520 --> 14:56.240
from the door she's wanting to scoot towards the door with keith all right we got the key

14:56.240 --> 15:02.560
to this place from a guy that we know to be charles do you know charles the tall guy yeah

15:02.560 --> 15:06.320
yeah how do you know we work together

15:09.440 --> 15:12.320
do you know who you're fucking with

15:12.320 --> 15:23.600
no you should probably get more information because you are going to regret this

15:25.360 --> 15:36.000
can you point me in a direction do the words marvin glass mean anything around these parts

15:36.800 --> 15:46.080
now out of character you guys know marvin glass is the mob dude in the city he runs the city

15:47.280 --> 15:53.680
of course i know marvin glass then you know

15:54.640 --> 15:58.960
no no

16:03.200 --> 16:04.080
coughs and cuts

16:08.560 --> 16:16.080
then you know that you probably don't want to be on his bad side right now you're on the

16:16.080 --> 16:21.760
contention pd's bad side you know what i'm fucking tired it's been a long ass day and your buddy

16:21.840 --> 16:27.520
charles got his head blown off by me where the fuck is his radio the radio

16:27.520 --> 16:30.320
sorry the radio that all sounds like you

16:33.280 --> 16:34.480
she's having like a breakdown

16:38.560 --> 16:44.960
you just want the radio oh no we actually want quite a bit more but god damn you are not being

16:44.960 --> 16:50.640
very forthcoming we got guns on you we don't really even like vigna like well that's uh

16:51.520 --> 16:57.120
she wants to be in the doorway with vigna and she wants you two to be over by the bathroom in this

16:57.120 --> 17:02.640
motel room are you gonna do that i'm not i think i probably am all right so john what are you doing

17:02.640 --> 17:09.920
she's got a knife to his throat yeah i don't know man john yeah john like john will scoot

17:09.920 --> 17:14.320
but he's pissed that makes sense mostly mostly at vigna

17:14.320 --> 17:22.000
first i'm like sweating bullets right now i've i am not confident that she's not gonna still

17:22.000 --> 17:28.880
kill me i mean if all you want's the radio it's in the bathroom how does it work i don't know

17:28.880 --> 17:34.480
you probably turn it on turn it to the station you want why did you want it i don't know charles

17:34.480 --> 17:38.480
brought it back he said don't touch it it's in the bathroom i didn't know it was a big fucking deal

17:38.480 --> 17:45.440
why did marvin send you here oh i mean marvin marvin sent us here to find out what happened

17:45.440 --> 17:52.720
to his son who's his son well i mean germane glass him and i mean him and alfred came to collect some

17:52.720 --> 18:00.400
money from john peters and then you know only alfred came back and he's a blubbering idiot

18:00.400 --> 18:04.880
now so what do you mean now he won't shut up about some gun

18:04.880 --> 18:15.760
i don't know what gun some uh he i i don't know that he sounded like a lunatic but marvin sent us

18:15.760 --> 18:21.040
out here to find it find uh find germane this is hilarious to me because now it's you who has

18:21.040 --> 18:28.560
no idea what the fuck you're dealing with if you had any idea how long our day has been the shit

18:28.560 --> 18:34.160
we've been through the things we've seen marvin glass you think we give a shit

18:34.880 --> 18:41.280
about the crime lord from the city contention is in some real shit right now you're in some

18:41.280 --> 18:46.160
real shit too because you had to be banging around with that charles guy i don't know what your man

18:46.160 --> 18:50.960
got into sounds like he stumbled into what we're into but this is a lot bigger than some crime

18:50.960 --> 18:56.240
bosses so why don't you fucking let keith go and come with us and answer some questions and we

18:56.240 --> 19:02.800
might be able to protect you from what that's what we're trying to figure out that radio turned a man

19:02.800 --> 19:10.160
into a cat bullshit that gun turned your buddy and alfred into an idiot that makes sense right

19:10.960 --> 19:18.960
ma'am uh the gun can do that so can a radio he's uh he's telling you the truth we've seen some shit

19:18.960 --> 19:26.240
today and marvin is not even ranking on the list right now do you know billy harrison no charles

19:26.240 --> 19:31.280
had him in the trunk of his car i don't know a billy hairs i literally okay you're you want to

19:31.280 --> 19:39.760
know the deal i'm good at killing it's what i do and i get brought along to kill if it's necessary

19:39.760 --> 19:45.840
i like you're stopping me from watching my happy days and i just want to watch my happy days

19:45.840 --> 19:51.840
so i i don't want to get caught up in all this i just want to go back home and

19:54.240 --> 19:59.440
where's charl where's charles do you did you arrest him i shot him in the fucking head with

19:59.440 --> 20:05.520
a shotgun was he a good killer because he fucking died pretty well oh my god okay so here's what's

20:05.520 --> 20:15.280
gonna happen i need everyone to roll dexterity i got a 14 on a 60 i got a 7 on a 65 i got a 73 on

20:15.280 --> 20:22.320
a 60 i failed fail and then you guys both succeeded and what were your numbers 14

20:22.320 --> 20:30.720
seven okay she rolled a 26 so she gets to go first and then 14 and then keith vigno wait

20:30.720 --> 20:36.400
she gets to go first correct she she rolled higher higher under how we always played i know

20:37.440 --> 20:43.360
like that i would have known to roll higher oh i'm so sorry i told you it makes it so that if

20:43.360 --> 20:49.040
she has a higher pool she can still be you that makes sense yeah that does make sense okay sick

20:49.040 --> 20:55.200
so uh she's gonna take the first action she's going to do the classic hostage move where she

20:55.200 --> 21:02.480
just pushes the person that she has and then she's gonna she's running yeah so she dips and

21:02.480 --> 21:07.760
it is keith next wait the dexterity rolls were like initiative i was thinking that it was our

21:07.760 --> 21:12.880
chance of getting away from her normally whoever has the highest dexterity goes first but i thought

21:12.880 --> 21:17.840
since it was such a tense moment that we'd add a little roll in there on our dexterity's to uh

21:17.840 --> 21:22.240
make it a little bit more playful uh because she has a higher higher dexterity than you guys do

21:22.240 --> 21:31.680
so what's her dex 80 oh that's very hot so she pushes keith and then turns around and jumps over

21:31.680 --> 21:37.680
the railing keith what do you do i run outside look over the railing and how far away is she

21:37.680 --> 21:43.600
she hit the ground and is gonna start running i'm gonna do called shot shooter in the like leg okay

21:43.600 --> 21:50.720
uh go ahead and roll at a negative 20 shit fail all right so keith pops off a couple rounds

21:50.720 --> 21:54.880
john it is your turn uh yeah i mean i'm running to the balcony i'm shooting at her too

21:56.240 --> 22:06.880
62 on a 60 all right and she's going to continue running clark what are you doing i'm running out

22:06.880 --> 22:12.720
and taking a shot as well so she is across she's like halfway across the parking lot at this point

22:12.720 --> 22:19.040
and is heading to a maroon car in the parking lot roll firearms are you just i'm just shooting

22:19.040 --> 22:30.480
at her just shooting trying to hit her all right uh crit pass 66 on an 80. i'm good at shooting

22:30.480 --> 22:35.120
boys yeah you're very good at shooting i'm a shooter boy go ahead and roll 2d 10 for me

22:35.120 --> 22:44.080
eight intense 18 is zero zero and eight yeah yeah 18 that's 18 so

22:46.720 --> 22:55.120
you fire and like i'm thinking probably three shots hit her center mass and she is i mean blood

22:55.120 --> 23:02.320
just splatters not only like onto the ground but also uh onto the car that she was like running

23:02.320 --> 23:10.240
toward and she she passes her constitution check to stay conscious and she starts trying to get

23:10.240 --> 23:14.880
into this car like we're right by the stairs right i mean yeah just imagine yeah i run down

23:14.880 --> 23:19.840
the stairs and i go like try to go up to her can i do anything else or you can just get to her

23:19.840 --> 23:24.800
yeah okay i get to her then yeah before he gets to her i'm gonna shoot her again okay

23:24.800 --> 23:32.800
fail 82 on a 16 pop off a couple more rounds in the general direction clark what are you doing

23:32.800 --> 23:40.480
i'm following keith okay she gets the door open um she's bleeding just like everywhere and

23:40.480 --> 23:45.760
she's crawling up into the driver's side yeah that's all she can do this round keith what are

23:45.760 --> 23:50.080
you doing i get to her and i start she doesn't have a weapon or anything with her does she i

23:50.080 --> 23:58.080
mean i think she has your knife or her knife that she threw yeah yeah do i see it in her hand yeah

23:58.080 --> 24:05.120
all right i want to try to if i like punch her in the face that's melee right if you're unarmed

24:05.120 --> 24:09.600
you're it's unarmed if you had a weapon i mean she's got three bullets in the center of her

24:09.600 --> 24:14.080
chest are we still in combat with her like what can she do with a knife fucking nothing try to

24:14.080 --> 24:19.520
stab me well yeah i feel like you can very much just lift her the fuck up and if she tries i just

24:19.520 --> 24:25.600
want to like if so is she sitting in the driver's seat she's crawling she's like well she's crawling

24:25.600 --> 24:30.160
up into the driver's seat currently with the door open she's got like one hand on the door and just

24:30.160 --> 24:34.000
one knife in her hand just like can i come up behind keith and just kick her hand with the

24:34.000 --> 24:38.960
knife yeah i was gonna think yeah if you do that and then i was gonna do first aid on her to try

24:38.960 --> 24:43.520
to keep her alive just to be able to get any more info out of her yeah i don't want to kill her yet

24:43.520 --> 24:48.640
if we don't have to oh yeah my intent in kicking her hand knife free was for you to start cuffing

24:48.640 --> 24:53.280
her but yeah we'll cuff her and then first aid yeah you guys can do that like no problem

24:53.280 --> 24:57.760
cool cool so i have her cuffed and then i want to immediately start administering first aid to help

24:57.760 --> 25:03.200
or not bleed out or at least have her stay alive longer than okay go ahead and roll first aid 47

25:03.200 --> 25:10.880
on a 60 nice so you find um something to wrap you know or like put pressure on the wounds um all

25:10.880 --> 25:15.760
three of them are thrown through so you got six holes to contend with so there's blood all over

25:15.760 --> 25:22.240
your hands and it's going everywhere and uh can i be calling drew yeah sure hey uh drew drew we

25:22.240 --> 25:26.080

27:17.280 --> 27:24.160
old timey radio but like the little half yeah i was picturing it about two feet wide a foot tall

it's just that contention accent i'm just that young guy from earlier

28:31.760 --> 28:35.280
oh you sound a lot cooler all of a sudden he started smoking

28:35.280 --> 28:37.760
everyone around here kind of sounds like this

28:40.160 --> 28:46.960
that uh our our lackey guy what's his name tim or something lauren no it was ray but now it's not

28:46.960 --> 28:52.480
oh lauren is the officer who takes care of everything for you guys okay that doesn't

28:52.480 --> 28:58.400
sound right lauren i let's get it does though let's get lauren to uh meet the this perp at

28:58.400 --> 29:03.680
the hospital and keep an eye on her didn't it start with a d or it was travis right

29:03.680 --> 29:09.680
travis or i have no idea what you're talking about it's always been lauren you're pretty sure

29:09.680 --> 29:15.040
i do want to send lauren to keep an eye on this perp at the hospital perfect is that l-a-u or

29:15.040 --> 29:24.880
l-o-r-e yeah is it lauren lauren lauren it's lauren lauren lauren is it a boy or girl l-a-u-r-e-n

29:24.880 --> 29:27.440
she identifies as a woman dope is she hot

29:29.920 --> 29:39.760
idiot i'm sorry guys i am just i've had an off day you know an off well an off career so far

29:39.760 --> 29:46.240
for future reference if a woman slings a knife at you you're an officer of the law you can shoot

29:46.240 --> 29:51.280
her yeah but yeah and if then she then is just like peacefully like you know she surrendered

29:51.280 --> 29:56.400
she was still holding a pipe though i don't know why you would close that distance well

29:57.040 --> 30:02.320
because i am trying to get the most information i can out of these people i you know at the end

30:02.320 --> 30:08.080
of the day it would be great to take down the mob in the city be known for that you know and

30:08.160 --> 30:14.160
mob is like an oozy blackness spreading across decent society right we got one of

30:14.160 --> 30:18.880
those in contention right now that's an actual oozy blackness spreading across

30:18.880 --> 30:22.800
decent life forms you know what i mean like so do you want me to go

30:24.160 --> 30:30.800
kill her is that what you're telling me to do i'm kind of confused here i mean i want to be you

30:30.800 --> 30:35.440
guys are better cops than i am and i want to be a better cop so if you need me to just go kill her

30:35.440 --> 30:39.680
that's going to make me a better cop and didn't just tell me to do it we're not saying kill her

30:39.680 --> 30:45.360
now we're saying you probably could have killed her then but she's totally within your or at least

30:45.360 --> 30:50.000
winged her i mean but guess what i'm alive and she's alive and we can get information i don't

30:50.000 --> 30:55.600
see the downside of this right here she's barely alive let's yeah but barely alive is still

30:55.600 --> 31:01.200
technically alive we did seem to come out ahead on this one you are correct okay so the next

31:01.200 --> 31:09.200
perp i'll just kill him no well got it if they intend harm upon you keith go ahead and kill him

31:09.200 --> 31:13.120
i assume that every criminal wants to intend harm upon a police officer because that's

31:13.120 --> 31:18.720
criminals favorite crime right nothing i'm gonna have to maybe read up on this i don't

31:19.840 --> 31:27.200
a little a little confused here did you go to the academy yeah in the city i did yeah they taught

31:27.200 --> 31:32.000
me they taught me more up there than they taught you what year did you graduate i oh that's never

31:32.000 --> 31:41.280
mind that sorry too too personal too personal i forgot years don't exist we don't ask those

31:41.280 --> 31:44.880
kind of questions i'm just trying to i'm just trying to figure out that's yeah hr would be on

31:44.880 --> 31:51.280
my ass if i knew well i try not to kill anybody but i guess i'll make it more of a make more of

31:51.280 --> 31:57.680
an effort to kill then no it's again it's not about merely killing like so make them make them

31:57.680 --> 32:03.600
make them suffer maybe just be a little safer okay keith we're not telling you to make people

32:03.600 --> 32:09.920
suffer we're not telling you to kill people make them suffer but but do if i have maybe don't let

32:09.920 --> 32:14.960
them try to kill you or make you suffer right that's what we're golden rule i'll do some more

32:14.960 --> 32:20.240
research on how to act like a proper police officer and we'll get back to you in the meantime

32:20.240 --> 32:25.680
keith you ever played a video game do you like video game guy particularly john peters was is

32:25.680 --> 32:30.800
that what you're talking about that's probably what i was thinking of but you know when you've

32:30.800 --> 32:37.440
when you got your melee class and your ranged class it's generally not advised for the range

32:37.440 --> 32:43.920
class to try to close the distance and engage the melee class you know in their wheelhouse that's

32:43.920 --> 32:48.080
kind of what happened with that lady in the pipe and you and the knife keith nods his head and

32:48.080 --> 32:55.040
acts like he knows what you're talking about all right fellas uh she was talking about a gun that

32:55.040 --> 33:01.520
screwed up i think she said alford yeah made him made him an idiot well there was that girl back at

33:01.520 --> 33:06.480
mildred mitchell's house who she had a gun she had a gun that she shot at me and then disafucking

33:06.480 --> 33:11.840
peered and boy i tell you what i'd be talking about that for a while also hmm maybe we should

33:11.840 --> 33:16.080
they said alford did come back though right alford did come yeah alford yeah maybe we should be

33:16.080 --> 33:20.960
talking to him trying to find him but changed clark you still have that gun oh it didn't

33:20.960 --> 33:26.400
disappear with her for some reason i thought you guys took it i would assume oh that's right yeah

33:26.400 --> 33:30.480
i do remember that you know i know it was just the other day but it feels like weeks ago yeah

33:30.480 --> 33:36.320
we've got the we've got a camera a radio and again the gun they all have weird tubes coming off of

33:36.320 --> 33:41.440
them they've all got red and have we tried to turn the radio on or anything yet oh i would not we have

33:41.440 --> 33:48.720
not to do that we're not going to because of the cat man situation true unless you want to you have

33:48.720 --> 33:55.440
a dog right i don't want to be a dog well if you want to volunteer to turn that on while your dog

33:55.440 --> 34:00.080
is in the room so it's the one that gets well what if it switches with any but anything but if

34:00.080 --> 34:05.840
i could switch with you that would be pretty cool for me not for you so much but you know keith i

34:05.840 --> 34:13.040
mean in spite of all that we said here you you know i'm a good cop you're not that but you do

34:13.040 --> 34:17.440
have an attractive bod i would i would freak you friday with you let's talk about that later

34:19.120 --> 34:24.640
going back through my sweet little cop notebook uh there's one more item from that uh shop that

34:24.640 --> 34:29.040

34:45.680 --> 34:50.400
hunt him down what can we what can we do because we don't know what he was driving we don't know

34:50.400 --> 34:54.720
if he's on foot we just know what he was wearing he's kind of what he looks like he's got my radio

34:54.720 --> 35:00.720
i was thinking we should set up a trap yeah that radio trap we can mention something and just show

35:00.720 --> 35:04.480
up there and if it doesn't work then we can go to sleep and try it again tomorrow what do you think

35:04.480 --> 35:08.800
could trap him maybe he got on the bad side of charles and he was also snooping around john

35:08.800 --> 35:12.960
peters because he's looking into these artifacts as well so if we put it across the radio that we've

35:12.960 --> 35:18.080
got the radio and john peters or any of those yeah or that we've got a lead on where the radio is and

35:18.080 --> 35:23.040
we're headed there yeah right and then he shows up yeah but then we're there already so what do we

35:23.040 --> 35:27.360
say we have a lead on the john peters and the radio because he's he seemed like he was trying

35:27.360 --> 35:33.280
to find john not i mean perhaps we don't know that john peters is alive so if he's dead yeah but i

35:33.280 --> 35:37.680
don't think that this guy knows whether john is dead or not i think he was looking for him and

35:37.680 --> 35:40.960
couldn't find him we don't know what he was looking for at john peters house lots of people

35:40.960 --> 35:44.800
been poking around there lots of crazy devices turning people into catmen turning up around

35:44.800 --> 35:49.840
there if they think john peters is going to be there it'd be extra incentive well how about we

35:49.840 --> 35:55.200
give the description of a man who resembles john peters okay yeah let's do that i like that john

35:55.200 --> 36:01.920
peters is a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose so that's where do we want to set up

36:01.920 --> 36:06.960
this sting operation should we set it up like down the street from the police station let's

36:06.960 --> 36:11.520
make it convenient on ourselves at uh what it's on that street well there's the donut hole they

36:11.520 --> 36:17.360
could say he's there yeah is that a 24-hour donut hole where is the donut hole that's just something

36:17.360 --> 36:22.960
i made up that might be near the police station i was thinking if we for sure yeah oh cops like

36:22.960 --> 36:29.680
donuts yeah that's right so yeah that makes sense uh i just mean like if we could set up a place

36:29.680 --> 36:34.000
that we have like a van like a security man no i just meant like if there was buildings around

36:34.000 --> 36:38.800
wherever we're going that we could get on the rooftop camouflage right next door yeah like get

36:38.800 --> 36:43.360
up on the roof he's got some hunting blinds displayed in the parking lot yeah so i'm thinking

36:43.360 --> 36:48.480
like the downtown area where the police station is he has like roof access that we could like put

36:48.480 --> 36:55.040
one on the roof put somebody in a car or like in a in in like a personal vehicle why don't we just

36:55.040 --> 37:00.880
set up a dummy yeah in john peter's clothes in the middle of the parking lot and it looks like

37:00.880 --> 37:06.480
he's fiddling with the radio yeah and then we just fucking elmer futhish you know we wait for

37:06.480 --> 37:12.080
the bunny to show up not a terrible idea i don't think oh i do but i don't think we should have

37:12.080 --> 37:18.880
the radio out there what could go wrong um what do we just like have them go to the be like yeah

37:18.880 --> 37:22.960
they're in the donut hole and then just one of us could be sitting in there with like a hood on or

37:22.960 --> 37:27.440
something be like describe john peter's wearing a hoodie we have the hoodie on and then one of you

37:27.440 --> 37:32.400
guys like across the way on the top of the building and one of you guys or one of us in a

37:32.400 --> 37:38.560
car i like it so who wants to be the guy inside you have that sniper rifle do you want to be on

37:38.560 --> 37:42.720
the roof sure and then between me he already knows so this really does seem like a situation this guy

37:42.720 --> 37:47.600
already knows what i look like that's true being neutralizing instead of killing yeah i think you

37:47.600 --> 37:53.200
should be inside but he's he's already assaulted a cop he has his clothes yeah let's play it out

37:53.200 --> 37:58.640
though so he comes in let's say do i take him down from inside or do we wait till he gets outside i

37:58.640 --> 38:03.520
don't know if anybody should be sniping yeah i think we all just need to get this guy two of us

38:03.520 --> 38:08.480
like one of us be in the bathroom or something one guy be sitting there facing away from the window

38:08.480 --> 38:12.880
with a hoodie on and then one guy outside and then we all kind of like rush him once he like gets to

38:12.880 --> 38:16.000
where you are okay do you want to be in the bathroom or do you want to be in the bathroom

38:16.000 --> 38:19.040
do you want to be outside or in the bathroom i kind of got to go to the bathroom okay john in

38:19.040 --> 38:23.440
the bathroom i'll be waiting outside in a car and then once he goes inside i'll be closing closing

38:23.440 --> 38:27.840
in closing that closing that exit and then i'll just be inside be invading probably just take him

38:27.840 --> 38:32.640
down as soon as you see i probably have civvies at the station right oh yeah i'll swing by the

38:32.640 --> 38:37.840
station and put on my regular boy clothes yeah i'll put my regular clothes on too that way he

38:37.840 --> 38:42.720
doesn't like see a uniformed cop sitting in a car be in the bathroom so i'll just wear my clothes

38:42.720 --> 38:47.520
as soon as i see him i'll radio you i guess or maybe just shout you'll hear me shouting for

38:47.520 --> 38:54.240
him to freeze let's arrange some kind of signal you have your radio off and then i'll be outside

38:54.240 --> 38:59.760
once he goes inside i'll radio you there you go we'll close in on him i like it okay and break

38:59.760 --> 39:04.400
what's the plan uh i'm gonna be waiting i'm gonna swing by the station and put on my regular

39:04.400 --> 39:10.160
civilian clothes and sit in the donut hole i put on civilian clothes as well i sit in my car

39:10.160 --> 39:17.600
across the street from the donut hole and i radio in i've got a description a short balding man

39:17.600 --> 39:23.920
big eyes and a kind of small nose matching the description of a wanted person we have reason

39:23.920 --> 39:29.200
to believe that he might be dangerous and he's got he's got that that radio that we've been told

39:29.200 --> 39:34.320
about that we've been looking for so if we could get uh if we could get somebody down to the donut

39:34.320 --> 39:41.120
hole uh yeah it's gonna take me an hour probably to get down there yeah i'm i'm not anywhere close

39:41.120 --> 39:49.280
right now uh what about you john i am in the bathroom somewhere else it's gonna be a minute

39:49.280 --> 39:56.880
okay well uh if we can have maybe lauren or or drew get down there but uh it's gonna take all

39:56.880 --> 40:02.640
three of us a while to get there it seems like so i'm in route either way okay sick so you guys

40:02.640 --> 40:07.680
wait i've ordered a coffee and a single glazed donut and i'm maybe reading the paper from

40:07.680 --> 40:12.640
yesterday because it's like one in the morning yeah yeah real quick if you guys could all lose

40:12.640 --> 40:21.760
one willpower for me i am so excited guys i hope our plan works for absolutely nothing to happen

40:23.920 --> 40:31.040
okay so after about 15 minutes a black suv rolls up and parks a block away from the donut hole

40:31.040 --> 40:37.840
a very short young woman and a very tall old man get out and they are both wearing a black suit

40:37.840 --> 40:44.640
white shirt black tie black sunglasses and an ill-fitting windbreaker that says fbi in big

40:44.640 --> 40:52.000
letters across the back clark as you sip on your coffee you hear the door behind you swing open

40:52.000 --> 40:57.760
the door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps out of the corner of your eye you see

40:57.760 --> 41:04.080
a short young woman walk across the shop to the counter the other footsteps approach you from

41:04.080 --> 41:16.400
behind

41:34.080 --> 41:46.400
oh

41:54.160 --> 42:00.400
street me down takes me back
