00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Hey, hey, hey, baby, baby.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.560
It's your surrogate uncle bringing all the funk.

00:07.560 --> 00:11.800
It's your big bad dad that is always so rad.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.200
Your mother that loves to smother.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.440
Your aunt that likes to use weird font.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.160
I'm all that and more, never an eyesore.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.440
It is I, Wolf the dog, and I am breaking through

00:24.440 --> 00:28.440
all that mental fog to do what you ask.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.160
To broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:32.160 --> 00:36.200
my various family members and or babies.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.160
Now, speaking of family,

00:38.160 --> 00:41.480
we got a letter from someone very dear to us.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.640
This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Taylor B,

00:44.640 --> 00:48.000
who tagged that pretending pod over there on Twitter.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.720
They write, howdy wolf, the dog, not wolf's dog, wolf.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.800
Just wanted to drop a line and let you know

00:54.800 --> 00:56.960
I've been greatly enjoying the radio show

00:56.960 --> 00:59.920
you host every hour on the hour.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.600
Been listening to it nonstop

01:01.600 --> 01:04.280
since I discovered it several days ago.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.960
Or was it weeks ago?

01:05.960 --> 01:07.320
I don't know anymore.

01:07.320 --> 01:09.720
I haven't turned the channel on my old radio

01:09.720 --> 01:13.400
since I fixed it to 694.2 PTBP,

01:13.400 --> 01:16.120
the only radio station my old box

01:16.120 --> 01:18.240
even picks up anymore, I think.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.120
Anyway, I wanted to just send you a friendly reminder

01:21.120 --> 01:23.960
that Mark Zuckerberg is absolutely the worst.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.360
However, I also wanted to remind you

01:26.360 --> 01:29.400
he and his robot cronies are in charge of Instagram

01:29.400 --> 01:31.240
as well as Facebook.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.440
I mean, face foot.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.320
I mean, ah, nevermind.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.880
When you trust social media,

01:35.880 --> 01:38.400
you're allowing your identity and your time

01:38.400 --> 01:41.280
and your attention to be sold to the lowest bidder.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.960
That's why I use my Twitter to pimp out cool shit

01:43.960 --> 01:45.800
like pretending to be people.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.640
You continue to haunt my dreams, wolfy boy.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.200
Keep it up.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.280
You only listen every hour on the hour?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.320
What about between the hours?

01:56.320 --> 02:00.600
What about the infinite space between all of time?

02:00.600 --> 02:02.960
The only social media wolf likes

02:02.960 --> 02:05.360
was Craigslist Miss Connections.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.960
Lot of folks think they see me skulking around

02:07.960 --> 02:10.960
in the dead of night rummaging through a dumpster of three.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.760
Lot of folks might be right.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.280
Remember, if you wanna write up something for your wolf

02:15.280 --> 02:17.120
to have, tag us on the internet.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.000
Fuck every billionaire.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.600
Or write up a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.040
All the links are in the show notes, my babies.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.800
This here is part two of Scott Dorward's wretched

02:29.800 --> 02:33.000
call a Cthulhu scenario bleak prospect,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.360
run by another than the published author himself,

02:36.360 --> 02:38.000
Scott Dorward.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.080
Don't step back because we're pushing forward.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.480
Clench your rucksack,

02:42.480 --> 02:45.520
because we're all cornered by Grady Philip drug

02:45.520 --> 02:47.680
with real life.

02:47.680 --> 02:52.680
Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.680
Easy times, feel less than serene.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.760
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings.

03:07.120 --> 03:12.120
So we long for days gone past us.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.920
Grief and strife,

03:16.920 --> 03:21.920
but even that's real life.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.680
Life.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.760
Zach, will you make your bald head look like a cat again?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.280
That's awesome.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.880
It makes me think I'm like a Star Trek.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.320
I'm a Star Trek.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.320
So, I mean, okay, so something that, you know,

03:42.320 --> 03:45.880
when you see like bald cats that have those big folds,

03:45.880 --> 03:48.600
something I did not realize is that cats that have

03:48.600 --> 03:53.120
darker stripes on their heads, which is a lot of cats,

03:53.120 --> 03:55.160
they just follow the pass of that fold.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.000
Oh, wow.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.040
So all cats look fucking weird underneath their hair.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.680
Oh, oh God.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.160
Okay, well, I've got a tabby

04:04.160 --> 04:07.400
and I'll never look at her the same way again now.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.560
I know, I know.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.560
Those are those weird like bald cat folds.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.400
Oh, dear.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.640
Dr. Coombs was feeling pretty good.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.640
Yes, so yeah, what actually happens with Dr. Coombs

04:29.400 --> 04:34.400
is mechanically you gain seven points of pow

04:37.720 --> 04:39.640
and six points of luck.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.280
God's number and the devil's number back to back.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.200
All I'm hearing is that I need to spend some luck

04:46.200 --> 04:48.320
before I step on one of these things.

04:48.600 --> 04:53.600
But yes, you are at the same time very aware

04:56.360 --> 04:59.880
that this thing is moving around inside your foot.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.280
You can't really feel it, but at the same time,

05:03.280 --> 05:06.320
you can, you know, you just know it's there.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.480
Do I maintain a sense of fear from it?

05:08.480 --> 05:09.320
Or does-

05:09.320 --> 05:10.160
Well, it's up to you.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.800
Is that okay with me?

05:11.800 --> 05:14.680
When obviously you have a parasite

05:14.680 --> 05:16.560
that has borrowed its way into your flesh.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.760
So, I mean, that may not make you especially happy,

05:20.760 --> 05:24.120
but on the flip side, you're feeling good.

05:24.120 --> 05:24.960
You are a doctor,

05:24.960 --> 05:28.760
so you might get to be more weary of it than most.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.320
Yeah, if you don't want us to kill you

05:31.320 --> 05:33.120
in the next 10 minutes of gameplay.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.160
Doctor, where'd it go?

05:42.160 --> 05:45.920
Guys, it's in, I think it's in my foot.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.920
I can feel it.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.080
I can feel it moving around in there.

05:51.040 --> 05:51.920
It's a-

05:51.920 --> 05:53.840
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

05:53.840 --> 05:58.760
It's not the worst thing though.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.600
What?

06:00.600 --> 06:02.280
What's fucking worse?

06:02.280 --> 06:05.520
It doesn't feel bad.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.120
It doesn't feel bad.

06:07.120 --> 06:07.960
It doesn't-

06:08.960 --> 06:10.880
You are glowing, you're glowing.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.680
You're positively fucking radiant.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.360
Coombes kind of like straightens his back

06:15.680 --> 06:17.120
higher than it's been in a long time.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.720
Maybe like Crix's neck.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.280
It's a-

06:21.280 --> 06:22.120
It doesn't-

06:22.120 --> 06:22.960
More confident.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.920
It feels good.

06:23.920 --> 06:24.760
It feels good.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.600
It feels good.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.440
You look good.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.120
Doc, I'm just gonna say it, you're sexy.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.040
We've all been thinking it.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.680
Yeah, he kind of jogs in place a little.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.920
Yeah, this is better than I felt in years.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.600
This is, but I gotta get it out right though.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.880
That I got, I mean, it's a parasite, right?

06:42.880 --> 06:43.720
It's like-

06:43.720 --> 06:44.680
Yes, yeah.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.680
Put your foot up on the table, we're gonna chop it off.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.400
We're gonna chop up your foot for sure.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.240
Oh, hold on.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.880
Let me see if I can wriggle around in there,

06:52.880 --> 06:54.040
like that thing could.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.920
Maybe it's still just flesh mush.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.640
I mean, but I, yeah.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.920
I grab the doctor's foot

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
and see if I can stick my fingers inside.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.400
You certainly can.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.520
Yeah, once you find the right spot in there,

07:05.520 --> 07:09.840
your fingers just sink into the warm,

07:09.840 --> 07:12.240
soft embrace of his flesh.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.000
Oh, oh no.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.480
Oh, oh, doc, doc, yeah.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.000
I'm in your foot now.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.400
My fingers are in your foot.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.160
Frederick Mellon I is jealous.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.080
Does that cause me pain or is it just a thing?

07:26.080 --> 07:29.880
It's just a thing, you barely feel it.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.880
On the other hand, I think Thomas Dolan

07:31.880 --> 07:32.960
needs to make a sand roll

07:32.960 --> 07:37.040
because your finger is now deep within his foot.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.080
That's a 15, he's fine with it.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.120
It's just one of those things,

07:46.120 --> 07:50.000
you know, life's been pretty kooky the last few years.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.320
Why would I let this, you know,

07:52.320 --> 07:53.720
of all things get me down?

07:53.720 --> 07:57.360
So Freddie, pass me those tongs.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.800
Yeah, you go.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.560
All right, doc,

08:00.560 --> 08:03.000
I'm gonna try to fish this thing out of you, all right?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Yeah, if you can't, that's okay.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.920
If you can't find it, that's fine too.

08:08.920 --> 08:09.840
All right, yeah.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.880
So if I keep, like,

08:12.880 --> 08:16.040
does my hand just keep slipping up in there

08:16.040 --> 08:17.360
without resistance, like?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.200
Yeah.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.680
What is the physical limitation of what I can get in there?

08:20.680 --> 08:22.360
Sooner or later, I'm,

08:22.360 --> 08:25.200
yeah, sooner or later you hit the barrier

08:25.200 --> 08:27.880
of the edge of his foot

08:27.880 --> 08:30.120
and your finger doesn't come out the other side.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.360
So, you know, you get most of your finger into his foot.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.480
Do I feel the little, do I feel the thing in there?

08:37.480 --> 08:39.240
You absolutely do.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.160
And it is quite spiky and there's a sharp moment of pain

08:44.160 --> 08:48.400
as you can feel his little teeth biting into your flesh.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.640
Freddie, there's no time for the tongs

08:51.640 --> 08:55.400
and I'm gonna gingerly holding onto, like, two spikes,

08:55.400 --> 08:58.160
just try to whip it out.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.000
Okay.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.600
Well, it's even easier than that

09:00.600 --> 09:03.000
because its teeth have sunk into you.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.360
So as you pull your finger out,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.280
it's just there clasped onto the edge

09:06.280 --> 09:08.040
of your finger, wriggling.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.960
Freddie, fucking step on it.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.200
I don't care if you crush my finger,

09:11.200 --> 09:12.560
you step on this motherfucker.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.600
No, it went through his foot last time.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.440
That's what we tried.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.360
It's the same thing.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.560
Right, okay.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.040
We need another plan.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.080
Frederick.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.320
I didn't wanna do this.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.120
And he just cocks the shotgun.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.800
Hold on, hold on.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.720
Who's got a lighter?

09:32.720 --> 09:33.920
That's smarter.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.360
I smoke, I've got a lighter.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.440
Okay, yeah, you've got a Zippo lighter

09:40.440 --> 09:42.520
with a little bit of fuel in it.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.600
I flick it into the thing

09:44.600 --> 09:46.720
and I put the flame to the bottom of it

09:46.720 --> 09:47.640
and I see what happens.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.440
Okay, yeah, I mean, it starts catching fire

09:50.440 --> 09:53.560
and almost immediately drops off onto the ground,

09:53.560 --> 09:54.800
screaming in pain.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.720
There's a kind of purplish ooze coming out of it

09:59.720 --> 10:02.160
as it's writhing on the ground in agony.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.080
I'm gonna bring the lighter to the ground

10:04.080 --> 10:06.880
and try to torch the rest of the thing,

10:07.240 --> 10:09.840
keep the flame to it and try to dispose of it.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.360
Doctor, do you have anything flammable

10:11.360 --> 10:13.840
you could dump on to make the flame bigger

10:13.840 --> 10:15.960
but not too big to burn down your shack here?

10:15.960 --> 10:17.080
Bit of rubbing alcohol.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.680
I don't, yeah, I don't think I wanna start a fire.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.760
Maybe we just keep doing the Zippo for a minute

10:20.760 --> 10:21.600
and see if we can.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.420
No, let's make it bigger.

10:22.420 --> 10:26.120
No, let's get it really, really burning in here.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.840
No, it looks like it's working.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.000
It looks like the creature's dying.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.080
Sorry, I can't see, my glasses are broken.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.480
Maybe it was made by Bic,

10:34.520 --> 10:39.520
but it does not like the Zippo, the Zippo interaction, so.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.640
Yeah, and certainly after a few seconds

10:43.640 --> 10:46.520
or 30 seconds or whatever of burning this thing,

10:46.520 --> 10:49.320
it is very much dead.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.720
What does my finger look like where it bit me?

10:51.720 --> 10:54.760
Like it's had a small chunk of flesh bitten out of it.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.640
But no spreading necrosis or?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.880
Just blood and pain.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.560
Ghostly voice emanating from it.

11:02.560 --> 11:03.400
Okay.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.920
Blood and pain, blood and pain.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.780
I think it's gonna be all right.

11:08.780 --> 11:13.780
So fire helps, fire helps against these things.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.680
So we get some oily rags

11:16.680 --> 11:18.720
and throw them on these fucking eggs

11:18.720 --> 11:21.120
before they hatch into critters

11:21.120 --> 11:25.840
that can pass through the walls of off-feet and mason jaws.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.280
Yeah, well, I guess we're gonna have to do something.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.880
We can't leave these here if they hatch.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.120
Like you said, they'd run amok in this place.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.920
Doc, I got a feeling there might be a few more people

11:36.920 --> 11:39.500
in this camp with these eggs in them you could study.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.680
So why don't we just burn these ones we got right now?

11:42.680 --> 11:45.440
Yeah, I think that's what we gotta do.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.760
I can't take the risk of this getting out of here.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.160
Yeah, I mean, it's fairly simple.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.360
You can just put a bit of surgical spirit in there

11:52.360 --> 11:55.680
and light that and destroy the eggs

11:55.680 --> 11:57.880
and the one that's hatched really easily.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.160
Perfect, that's what we'll do.

11:59.460 --> 12:02.880
Then you dispose of your specimens quickly,

12:02.880 --> 12:05.960
simply, and without catastrophe.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.900
Scott, you just saw us do the only smart thing

12:08.900 --> 12:13.900
we've ever done in our entire role-playing careers.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.440
I just kept my mouth shut the whole time.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.760
I was like, just don't say anything and they'll fix it.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.700
It'll be okay.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.800
So, now what?

12:27.840 --> 12:29.800
We gotta keep our eye on the prize at this point.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.280
We gotta get Billy and Esther back.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.460
I think we should head over to Hiram's old place.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.500
So, Grillies or Greenleys?

12:37.500 --> 12:38.600
Greenleys.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.200
Greenleys, let's set out boys.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
So, do you think they've been taking us

12:43.200 --> 12:45.040
and putting the eggs inside of us

12:45.040 --> 12:47.280
and then they hatch and then they go into other people

12:47.280 --> 12:49.200
and that's how it's spreading?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.440
You said something about a sacrifice earlier,

12:51.440 --> 12:54.700
but I was thinking that maybe they just take us

12:54.700 --> 12:58.260
to put the eggs inside of us.

12:58.260 --> 13:01.380
Did Nancy, Nancy said something about them.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.540
Did she say taken, they were taken people?

13:03.540 --> 13:04.540
Did she say that?

13:04.540 --> 13:06.940
No, she just said something about a puppet singing.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.560
Before that though, she talked about people without faces.

13:09.560 --> 13:10.940
Oh, that's right.

13:10.940 --> 13:12.000
Maybe they were in masks

13:12.000 --> 13:14.420
that don't have any designs on them.

13:14.420 --> 13:18.060
Why don't we just worry about one spooky thing at a time?

13:18.060 --> 13:19.860
But what if the spooky things are connected?

13:19.860 --> 13:23.140
How likely is it that the spooky things are?

13:23.140 --> 13:24.740
Park the car and have a job.

13:24.740 --> 13:25.880
I'm sure they are.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.340
I'm sure they are connected,

13:28.340 --> 13:32.420
but let's just, you know, let's go to Greenleys.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.300
We'll find out, we'll see what's going on.

13:34.300 --> 13:35.820
You're operating under the assumption though

13:35.820 --> 13:39.140
that maybe there's more of these things there.

13:39.140 --> 13:40.900
Is that what you're saying, Frederick?

13:40.900 --> 13:41.740
Should we take something?

13:41.740 --> 13:42.560
Oh yeah, I think they're growing them.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.620
I think they're breeding them.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.620
Should we take something fiery with us?

13:45.620 --> 13:48.180
Something we can use if we run into them?

13:48.180 --> 13:49.500
Well, definitely, yeah.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.560
I mean, we should, what do we got?

13:51.560 --> 13:52.400
What do we got?

13:52.400 --> 13:55.040
Probably we don't have access to a flamethrower.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.280
I don't know if that's been invented yet.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.600
In the medical shack, I mean,

13:58.600 --> 14:00.720
you do have a little bit of surgical spirits

14:00.720 --> 14:04.000
that you use for disinfecting wounds.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.560
I'm not a whole hell of a lot, but you got some.

14:06.560 --> 14:11.160
And you've also got maybe a pint of paraffin left

14:11.160 --> 14:12.320
that you use for the heater.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.400
I'm gonna create little perfect,

14:14.400 --> 14:17.160
little pocketable vials of flammable.

14:17.160 --> 14:21.400
So mixing maybe the spirits and the paraffin if need be

14:21.400 --> 14:23.520
and create like a little line of them

14:23.520 --> 14:25.280
that I can hand out to the guys.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.520
And then if we have lighters, each of us

14:28.520 --> 14:30.920
or something like that, it's just, these are just like-

14:30.920 --> 14:32.240
I pop one right behind my mouth

14:32.240 --> 14:33.880
assuming it's a cyanide capsule.

14:37.880 --> 14:42.880
I'm picturing them as like just little to-go fuel canisters.

14:43.080 --> 14:43.920
Yeah.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.160
Like you can pour them on something if you need to

14:45.160 --> 14:46.240
to light it, but I don't think,

14:46.240 --> 14:48.280
they're not like mini Molotovs, but like-

14:48.280 --> 14:50.840
Glass vials of combustible.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.240
Whatever.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.080
Yep, okay.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.000
It's definitely, it's awkward in his mouth.

14:57.800 --> 14:58.840
But surprisingly tasty.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.360
Dolan, drop it, drop it.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.400
We all grab lighters

15:05.400 --> 15:10.000
and I think we should head straight to Greenleys.

15:10.000 --> 15:10.880
Okay.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.640
Mr. Mellon, did you grab that shotgun?

15:12.640 --> 15:13.480
Did that happen?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.400
This one?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.440
Oh yeah, I need to uncock it.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.000
That's what it's called, right?

15:19.120 --> 15:19.960
Depends on.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.360
The kind of shotgun, I think.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.400
It's this kind.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.720
Yeah, it's a double barrel shotgun.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.560
Yes.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.240
So yeah, it's not a pump action one.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.560
It's that kind, we say, pointing to what he's got.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.400
Okay, it's kind of spooky, but let's go to Greenleys.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.080
The back door was the idea, right?

15:39.080 --> 15:39.920
Or the back window.

15:39.920 --> 15:40.760
That's what Hiram said.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.160
I'd say maybe even a mile before,

15:43.160 --> 15:46.080
we're not gonna wanna be seen on the road heading there.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.520
Or we're like a mile out, right?

15:47.520 --> 15:50.200
Yeah, it's probably about 20 minutes walk

15:50.400 --> 15:51.240
from where you are.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.400
Maybe like a quarter mile.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.600
We could get off the road.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.480
I don't know why we gotta make it super hot on ourselves.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
Anyway, let's head out.

15:58.480 --> 16:03.480
Yeah, I mean, by this stage, it's probably early afternoon.

16:03.480 --> 16:08.040
So you make your way up the road towards Greenleys.

16:08.040 --> 16:12.200
And yeah, I mean, there are grounds to the house.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.360
So you can make your way off the road earlier

16:16.360 --> 16:18.640
than the driveway that goes up there

16:18.840 --> 16:22.440
by perhaps forcing your way through a hedge.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.280
And yeah, I mean, this is a fairly nice house.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.800
It's got what you reckon are probably

16:27.800 --> 16:32.040
several acres of ground, fairly well-tended.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.040
The lawn's nicely manicured.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.840
There's a few flower beds,

16:35.840 --> 16:38.200
which obviously aren't in bloom at this time of year,

16:38.200 --> 16:42.240
but are still in good condition.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.840
I bet those are really nice when they're in season.

16:44.840 --> 16:49.840
Yeah, the house itself, it's a stone-built structure

16:50.040 --> 16:55.040
in fair old size, probably no more than about 50 years old.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.360
The thing that probably gets your attention

16:58.360 --> 17:01.800
more than anything else is there are a number of cars

17:01.800 --> 17:03.560
parked outside there.

17:03.560 --> 17:07.400
It looks like Mr. Brink collects cars.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.200
Can we get a sense of any activity from our vantage point?

17:10.200 --> 17:12.080
Can we see maybe people in the windows

17:12.080 --> 17:14.680
or if there's anybody working the grounds

17:14.680 --> 17:15.840
or anything like that?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.640
Sure, give me a spot hidden, Roll.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.880
I failed a 57 on a 25.

17:23.880 --> 17:24.720
Okay.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.200
I rolled a 55 on a 55.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.960
Yeah, certainly Freddy looking around

17:29.960 --> 17:34.040
doesn't notice any gardeners or anything.

17:34.040 --> 17:37.120
There don't seem to be any staff on site.

17:37.120 --> 17:42.000
You can't really see any activity going onto the windows.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.160
The place looks fairly quiet.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.340
It looks good.

17:45.340 --> 17:46.440
Do you wanna just move?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.940
Hey guys, they should call him Mr. Cause, right?

17:54.360 --> 17:55.480
They should call him Mr. Cause.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.040
Does he come before an effect?

17:57.040 --> 17:59.200
I'm confused, what are you talking about?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.280
All the cause.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.680
All his key, he's got a lot of, let's go to the back.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.800
Did we see that big, Caddy?

18:13.640 --> 18:17.720
Yeah, you do, there is a big black Cadillac

18:17.720 --> 18:19.300
parked out the front.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.580
Quiet, we gotta stay quiet as we're moving along

18:22.580 --> 18:25.520
through the back, okay, because if anyone hears us

18:25.520 --> 18:27.080
once we get within earshot,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.920
they're not gonna take too kindly.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.920
I'm afraid, you know, the face of a thief

18:33.920 --> 18:35.960
is not one that people forget.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.960
Fred, are you saying you hit this place before?

18:37.960 --> 18:39.760
If the servants here are the same as they were

18:39.760 --> 18:41.360
when Hiram was here, then, hmm.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.720
Wait, okay, well, but Hiram, he didn't really,

18:46.720 --> 18:48.760
he doesn't know you robbed this place, right?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.840
He also said he didn't have servants,

18:50.840 --> 18:52.680
so who were those people there that night?

18:52.680 --> 18:54.820
I don't know, okay, moving on.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.860
Nevermind, we're good, no one's gonna recognize me,

19:01.860 --> 19:04.500
not trying to make it harder for ourselves, that'd be silly.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.040
Let's sneak into the back now.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.120
All right, yeah.

19:08.120 --> 19:12.840
Okay, well, you make your way around

19:12.840 --> 19:16.480
to the back of the house, and sure enough,

19:16.480 --> 19:20.000
there is a little, a small little wing

19:20.000 --> 19:21.040
coming off the back of the house

19:21.040 --> 19:24.500
that looks like it is probably the servants' quarters,

19:24.500 --> 19:26.480
whereas the rest of the house is on two stories,

19:26.480 --> 19:28.940
this is a one-story structure just out the back.

19:28.940 --> 19:31.800
Okay, now, are we gonna try to sneak into the house

19:31.800 --> 19:33.480
and kinda get a feel of what's going on,

19:33.480 --> 19:35.480
or are we going straight down to the cellar?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.640
Play it by ear, and a little bit of column A,

19:38.640 --> 19:40.120
a little bit of column B,

19:40.120 --> 19:41.760
we gotta get through that door first, though.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.480
Yeah, our goal is to get through that,

19:43.480 --> 19:46.240
it's the window that had the broken lock, right?

19:46.240 --> 19:48.140
I think our goal should be the cellar,

19:48.140 --> 19:51.320
but yeah, keeping an eye out on the lay of the house,

19:51.320 --> 19:52.320
we're gonna have two kids,

19:52.320 --> 19:54.260
we're dragging out with this, hopefully.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.280
There's fucking dragons down there.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.780
Fuckers call Cthulhu.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.920
Dragons out!

20:02.960 --> 20:07.600
Are you, what, just forcing the lock on the window?

20:07.600 --> 20:09.840
Is your plan something else?

20:09.840 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna listen in

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
to try to look around through the window very stealthily

20:16.000 --> 20:18.600
to get a lay to see if, obviously,

20:18.600 --> 20:20.300
if there's someone right on the other side of the window,

20:20.300 --> 20:21.800
I don't wanna try to break in.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.060
Sure, you'd be able to see

20:24.060 --> 20:25.600
if there was someone on the other side of the window,

20:25.600 --> 20:26.880
there aren't any curtains up,

20:26.880 --> 20:29.640
and looking in, there definitely isn't.

20:29.680 --> 20:33.440
Then I'm gonna kinda cup my dirty,

20:33.440 --> 20:35.880
my doidy hand around my ear,

20:35.880 --> 20:38.400
and press it up against the glass,

20:38.400 --> 20:42.420
and try to see if I can hear anything

20:42.420 --> 20:44.800
going on inside the house.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.100
Okay, give me a listen roll.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.440
28 on a 50.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.120
Yeah, you listen, and no,

20:52.120 --> 20:55.740
you can't hear any activity at all.

20:55.740 --> 20:58.760
It's dead silent inside.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.960
So he's gonna go ahead and try to open up the window.

21:01.960 --> 21:05.920
Well, I think you only need to give me a stealth roll here

21:05.920 --> 21:08.120
because it's easy enough to force.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.200
It's just a question of whether you can do so quietly.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.560
43 on a 60.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.840
I mean, sure enough, as per Hiram's words,

21:14.840 --> 21:16.800
the lock on this is crap,

21:16.800 --> 21:19.920
and so just with a bit of force, yeah, it cracks,

21:19.920 --> 21:24.920
and you manage to avoid the noise of that being too loud,

21:25.560 --> 21:30.480
and the window squeaking as you slide it up.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.920
You have the window open,

21:31.920 --> 21:34.280
and you can clamber inside should you wish.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.360
Clamber indeed I do.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.880
I'm gonna follow suit.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.960
Frederick's kind of our guy who is breaky any,

21:40.960 --> 21:43.640
and I trust that he has done his due diligence,

21:43.640 --> 21:45.360
that this is an okay thing.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.400
The coast is clear, so I just follow in his footsteps.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.240
And as long as I don't hear anything

21:50.240 --> 21:53.560
calamitous happen to them, I follow as well.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.760
But I do pause for a moment

21:54.760 --> 21:57.360
to make sure nothing calamitous happens to them.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.560
If something calamitous is happening to them,

21:59.560 --> 22:01.680
it's happening very quietly.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.880
That's good enough for me to go on through.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.800
Okay, then yeah, the three of you clambering

22:07.800 --> 22:10.880
through this window, and the room inside

22:10.880 --> 22:13.640
is just a fairly simple bedroom.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.600
There's an unmade bed.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.120
Sorry, when I say unmade bed,

22:18.120 --> 22:19.560
there are no sheets or anything on there.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.200
It's just a mattress on the frame.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.800
There's a wardrobe and a chest of drawers,

22:23.800 --> 22:26.280
fairly simple looking furniture.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.480
The whole place just looks unlived in.

22:28.480 --> 22:32.400
You fellas know how long Hiram's not been here,

22:32.400 --> 22:35.440
how long it's been since his partner bought this place?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.680
Just at the start of it, you know,

22:37.680 --> 22:39.640
all the recent troubles.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.840
Enough time to have moved in.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.440
Maybe he doesn't have enough people

22:43.440 --> 22:46.680
to fill all these big, big house rooms.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.400
Yeah, it just looks like there's no servants living here.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.280
I say we press on into the house very quietly.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.120
Agreed.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.720
Yeah, the door from this room

22:54.720 --> 22:56.840
opens out into a small corridor.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.160
Down to the left, there's obviously a back door

23:01.160 --> 23:03.040
that comes in this way.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.920
Heading towards the right,

23:04.920 --> 23:08.680
it seems to go towards the main house.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.160
And you can see that, yeah, there is a door

23:11.160 --> 23:13.520
that opens up into,

23:14.720 --> 23:18.160
certainly it looks like it opens up into the main building.

23:18.160 --> 23:22.240
There's also, off to your left,

23:22.240 --> 23:25.840
a flight of stairs that seems to go down.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.360
You know, if we go down first,

23:29.360 --> 23:31.720
then we don't have to go into the big house.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.360
Settlers are usually down.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.680
I think we should go down.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.320
We get, that's the direction, right?

23:38.320 --> 23:41.440
I can only think of traps and pitfalls

23:41.440 --> 23:42.960
existing in the rest of the house,

23:42.960 --> 23:47.040
but we would figure out more of the fun mystery, so.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.240
But let's go down.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.360
You go down the stairs,

23:49.360 --> 23:53.000
and as you reach the bottom, it opens up,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.120
unsurprisingly, into some fairly large cellars.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.160
It looks like it's broken up

23:57.160 --> 23:58.840
into a number of different rooms.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.080
But it goes into, you know,

24:00.080 --> 24:02.000
initially one fairly large room

24:02.000 --> 24:04.240
that's got shelves lining the walls,

24:04.240 --> 24:05.400
most of which are empty.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.840
There's obviously some old supplies,

24:07.840 --> 24:09.520
or, you know, some old cleaning supplies

24:09.520 --> 24:12.120
and a few jars sitting on the shelves

24:12.120 --> 24:14.960
that look like they've probably been there for a long time.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.720
There's spiders' webs.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.760
There's an electric light you can turn on

24:19.760 --> 24:21.520
so you can see what you're doing.

24:21.520 --> 24:26.280
The only thing that stands out as being unusual

24:26.280 --> 24:28.560
or worthy of note in this room

24:28.560 --> 24:31.760
is there's a table towards the back

24:31.760 --> 24:36.760
that has a metal cylinder or case,

24:36.920 --> 24:40.560
or, you know, it looks like a large jar

24:40.560 --> 24:42.840
or, you know, some kind of canister,

24:42.840 --> 24:44.800
metal canister sitting there.

24:45.640 --> 24:50.640
And next to it, there's a pair of heavy leather gloves

24:50.680 --> 24:52.640
and a set of forceps.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.880
What do you think, Doc?

25:01.880 --> 25:06.000
Well, it looks like there's something inside that canister

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
that needs leather gloves and forceps to be touched.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.800
I don't know if I want to mess with that.

25:11.840 --> 25:16.840
That usually means something's dangerous.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.360
What if there was something in the canister,

25:20.360 --> 25:22.000
something like what we've seen,

25:23.040 --> 25:25.640
and that canister can hold it?

25:25.640 --> 25:28.000
I think we need the canister and those gloves, yeah.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.880
Yeah, I think 100% we should take it with us.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.960
Seems like these dickheads down in the cellar

25:32.960 --> 25:34.720
have found out the, you know,

25:34.720 --> 25:38.240
the safe way to deal with these parasites, so.

25:38.240 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, I think that's a good idea

25:40.000 --> 25:43.280
that at the very least, if it is specimens,

25:43.280 --> 25:45.760
that gives us another supply for me to test, yeah.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.840
Yeah, I mean, the canister is,

25:47.840 --> 25:52.320
I mean, it's about a foot in diameter.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.440
Not that heavy, but as you pick it up,

25:56.440 --> 26:00.080
you can feel liquid sloshing around inside.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.640
If I shake it, can I feel anything other than liquid?

26:03.640 --> 26:05.400
Can I feel anything hitting the sides?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.200
Yeah, you can.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.160
Yeah, there's definitely something suspended

26:09.160 --> 26:10.000
in liquid in here.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.520
But we can't see the liquid or anything in there, right?

26:12.520 --> 26:14.440
It's a metal canister, no.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.640
There's no glass in it.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.800
I mean, it seems, you know,

26:17.800 --> 26:20.800
maybe this is a thing for holding those fucking things.

26:20.800 --> 26:25.040
If it's not, we got a cool canister, so.

26:25.040 --> 26:28.840
I say that's what we put our money on.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.320
We put our money on the fact that it's holding these things

26:32.320 --> 26:34.640
and that this is where they start.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.760
And we use it as a bargaining chip

26:36.800 --> 26:38.700
as we head into the main house.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.120
If we need to dump it out on the floor

26:42.120 --> 26:46.720
or throw it on Casper, voice comes to voice.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.640
Do you think there's any merit in opening it here now

26:49.640 --> 26:50.640
just to see what's in it?

26:50.640 --> 26:52.000
Absolutely not. On the grounds here?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.520
No, no, I don't.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.360
I don't think, no, no.

26:57.560 --> 26:58.400
No.

27:00.080 --> 27:03.840
All right, Mellon gets really close to Dr. Coombs

27:03.880 --> 27:07.720
and puts his hand on his shoulder and says,

27:08.720 --> 27:11.800
I could tell that you felt real good when it was inside you,

27:13.200 --> 27:18.200
but we're gonna need you to stay.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.760
Keep your fucking head on straight, you fucking nut.

27:21.760 --> 27:22.720
Thank you.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.840
Yeah, yeah, no, of course.

27:24.840 --> 27:28.440
I just, if there was a place that we were going to open it,

27:28.440 --> 27:30.400
it might be better here and not back at the town.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.560
We're not gonna open it.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.400
Where everybody is, but.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.720
Yeah, we're not gonna open it here.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.120
We're not gonna open it in the wolverville.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.000
Fucking nowhere.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.800
No, this is like worst comes to worst.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.960
Like they come in and they say like,

27:41.960 --> 27:43.920
we're gonna kill you.

27:43.920 --> 27:44.880
We say, no, you're not.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.040
We'll pour this on you or on the ground.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.880
They probably don't want that either.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.080
What if the guy who's got it says,

27:53.080 --> 27:55.760
well, what, you're gonna hit me with my lunch pail?

27:55.760 --> 27:56.960
And it turns out there's a sandwich

27:56.960 --> 27:58.720
and a thermos of coffee in there.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.480
Then it will turned out we will have been caught in a bluff.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.600
But right now it seems like this is a good chip.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.280
We got to roll with it and not let these parasites.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.120
I'm with you.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.360
Spread in the wolverville.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.200
Yeah.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.240
Doc, for all we know, these things are in you and me.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.080
Well, actually, since we feel like shit

28:16.080 --> 28:18.800
and my business partner started doing great,

28:18.800 --> 28:19.760
maybe it's in him.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.600
I don't know.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.560
Maybe it feeds off two hosts simultaneously.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.640
We got to figure it out though.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.560
Yeah, there's a, you're right, you're right.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.400
We shouldn't open it.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.280
We shouldn't open it.

28:29.280 --> 28:34.280
And, and, and we got to save those kids, QAnon.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.960
Yeah, we, God.

28:37.960 --> 28:38.800
Oh my God.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.640
God.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.160
Yeah, let's, let's keep going.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.880
Let's see if, let's see if we can find anything down here.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.040
I'm going to take that canister from you.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.040
That's a good idea.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.080
All right, here you go, here you go, Freddy.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.760
You can, you can have the gloves.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.800
Yeah, maybe put the gloves on your, on your feet.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.680
Well, you poke around the rest of the cellars

29:10.680 --> 29:14.040
and I mean, there's not really a lot else

29:14.040 --> 29:15.520
of interest down here.

29:16.360 --> 29:19.560
There is a bit of a wine cellar.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.720
There's some fairly nice looking bottles of wine.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.320
Should you know anything about wine?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.360
Canonically, Thomas Dolan does

29:28.360 --> 29:31.000
and he grabs a few nice bottles of wine

29:31.000 --> 29:32.440
in case we have success.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.280
Excellent.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.240
What is that, a red?

29:35.680 --> 29:38.600
I spent some time rubbing shoulders with, you know,

29:38.600 --> 29:42.840
the Boston Brahmin and I can, I can tell you which,

29:42.840 --> 29:45.920
a few of these bottles, you know, they're not,

29:45.920 --> 29:47.200
they're not so bad.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.120
Mm, tannins.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.280
That's right.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.920
That's right, Freddy, tannins.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.680
Oh, it's got a floral bouquet.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.520
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.800
Well, you poke around the rest of the cellars

30:00.800 --> 30:03.600
and apart from your bottles of wine

30:03.600 --> 30:07.360
and the canister of whatever the fuck it is you found,

30:07.360 --> 30:10.600
you don't really find anything else of interest.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.720
It looks like, it looks like they weren't keeping

30:12.720 --> 30:13.680
anybody down here.

30:13.680 --> 30:17.360
There's nothing, nothing, no signs of entrapment

30:17.360 --> 30:18.600
or anything down here.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.240
Catherine Zeta-Jones wasn't down here?

30:22.240 --> 30:24.920
Catherine Zeta-Jones is not dancing beneath lasers

30:24.920 --> 30:25.760
down here.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.840
Before we head out, let me just quick poke around

30:31.840 --> 30:34.080
just to make sure there's no like hidden doorways

30:34.080 --> 30:37.120
or walls that aren't walls or nothing down here.

30:37.120 --> 30:40.760
Okay, so you're having your poke around in the cellar.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.720
You wanted to try to find any secret doors,

30:43.720 --> 30:46.440
so give me a spot hidden roll.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.840
Yes, 45 on a 55.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.880
Okay, you are fairly certain

30:52.880 --> 30:56.200
that there are no secret doors down here.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.440
There's no secret areas.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.920
It is just a cellar.

31:00.920 --> 31:01.840
Voic.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.920
What do you think, Mr. Mellon?

31:03.920 --> 31:04.920
Did you see any doors?

31:04.920 --> 31:05.760
Can we move on up?

31:05.760 --> 31:09.080
No, I've been poking and prodding for all the two minutes

31:09.080 --> 31:12.360
and there doesn't seem to be any stinking secret doors

31:12.360 --> 31:15.680
down here, so I gotta keep my voice down.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.400
Let's get back through into the main house

31:18.400 --> 31:19.560
and then we'll get going.

31:20.120 --> 31:20.960
All right, all right.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.560
I'll keep this canister handy.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.600
No offense, Mr. Mellon.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.440
It's just that you were a snagglepuss there for a second.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.160
My name's Frederick Mellon the First

31:34.160 --> 31:36.120
and I don't understand the reference.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.040
That makes sense.

31:39.040 --> 31:39.960
It's 1932.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.960
Let's go upstairs.

31:43.960 --> 31:48.960
Right, then yeah, you make your way back upstairs

31:50.840 --> 31:54.280
and like I say, there is a door that looks like it goes

31:54.280 --> 31:56.400
into the main house.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.320
Freddie, you should do that ear thing

31:58.320 --> 31:59.440
you were doing earlier.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.120
Yeah, I'll squish my ear right up against the wall.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.600
Okay, give me a listen roll.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.600
Oh, that's a fail, 82 on a 50.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.720
Yeah, there's no one there.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.880
There's no one there.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.600
It seems like the coast is clear.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.440
Let's go on in.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.000
Still be careful though.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.360
Still be careful and quiet.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.200
Why?

32:21.920 --> 32:22.760
That's a good point.

32:22.760 --> 32:23.600
There's no one there.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.360
We don't have to worry now.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.840
We should still be quiet.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.840
I carefully cracked the door open about an inch

32:29.840 --> 32:30.720
and I peep on through.

32:30.720 --> 32:31.920
Yeah, you crack the door open

32:31.920 --> 32:36.200
and it opens up into what looks like a fairly large kitchen.

32:36.200 --> 32:41.200
There's a dining area there, a range cooker

32:41.440 --> 32:44.320
and there's another doorway out from here.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.720
Now that you're in the kitchen,

32:45.720 --> 32:50.080
you can hear coming from upstairs

32:50.080 --> 32:54.400
what sounds like someone snoring fairly loudly.

32:54.400 --> 32:59.320
Boys, I don't want to be alarmist.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.840
I don't want to jump to conclusions,

33:01.840 --> 33:03.360
but it sounds like we might be dealing

33:03.360 --> 33:06.000
with a fairytale troll or giant.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.840
That's just my first read.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.680
Let's move on further into the house

33:15.680 --> 33:17.440
and see what we see.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.600
Melon puts his finger up to his mouth

33:20.600 --> 33:25.600
and like a shh motion points at like a butcher's knife

33:25.920 --> 33:27.360
in this kitchen.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.280
Dolan, put down your violin.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.580
Yeah, that's been on my back this whole time.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.560
Obviously since I haven't been playing it

33:39.560 --> 33:42.340
and referencing it, it's not because I forgot.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.960
I just assumed that you've been providing a soundtrack

33:46.960 --> 33:47.960
all the way along.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.360
As a rolling stealth check.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.020
Tom has stolen his sneaky as fuck.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.080
Yeah, so I'll grab that kitchen knife,

34:04.080 --> 34:07.120
that big chef's knife and arm myself.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.420
Good looking out, Freddie.

34:10.200 --> 34:15.120
Are you moving en masse to the source of the snoring?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.640
Are you doing something else?

34:16.640 --> 34:17.600
What are you up to?

34:17.600 --> 34:19.640
I'd like to look around remembering

34:19.640 --> 34:21.840
that they were dragged through the shanty town.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.120
I want to see if I can see any signs

34:24.120 --> 34:27.480
of like dirty floors or more drag marks

34:27.480 --> 34:28.960
or anything that would remind me

34:28.960 --> 34:32.360
of those bodies being dragged through the dirt like that.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.200
Sure, give me a spot heat and roll.

34:34.200 --> 34:39.200
It's a fail, a 40 on a 25.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.400
Oh, you don't see anything like that.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.120
Fellas, I think we should just make our way

34:47.960 --> 34:51.240
away from that snoring and find

34:51.240 --> 34:53.240
what rooms we can cover down here.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.480
And if we don't find the kids,

34:54.480 --> 34:55.940
we'll have to go up there.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.480
That is the exact opposite of what I was going to say,

34:58.480 --> 35:00.080
but I say we go with your plan.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.920
You wanted to go see who was snoring?

35:04.920 --> 35:06.800
I thought maybe Dolan could put the knife

35:06.800 --> 35:08.880
right against the snorer's throat.

35:08.880 --> 35:12.000
Yeah, I mean, but what about your shotgun?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.520
I mean, I could put it against his throat too,

35:14.520 --> 35:16.080
but it's not very sharp.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.300
Yeah, it's just more about the element of surprise

35:21.300 --> 35:22.320
when you wake up, right?

35:22.320 --> 35:24.720
Like if we're not going to kill him in his sleep,

35:26.840 --> 35:28.520
getting gravelly again,

35:28.520 --> 35:31.320
if you want to kill someone in the sleep,

35:31.320 --> 35:33.260
a knife is a knife.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.920
A knife in Harvard Yard is a perfect implement,

35:38.920 --> 35:42.180
but if you just want to wake somebody up

35:42.180 --> 35:45.520
and fucking scare them,

35:48.040 --> 35:50.600
then let's go with a shotgun in their face, right?

35:58.520 --> 36:02.200
Oh, man.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.680
I don't mind the plan of,

36:04.680 --> 36:07.880
that would actually cut out a lot of downtime of a search,

36:07.880 --> 36:10.200
and if we just wanted to cut straight to the quick

36:10.200 --> 36:11.800
and ask the people upstairs,

36:11.800 --> 36:14.200
the person who's snoring upstairs,

36:14.200 --> 36:16.520
where these kids are.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.360
Hey, Sleepy, what the fuck?

36:20.600 --> 36:23.160
Oh, good, so you already know what you're going to say.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.680
So that's your plan, is it?

36:26.680 --> 36:29.080
You're sneaking up the stairs.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.320
Are all three of you going?

36:30.320 --> 36:33.120
Are you sending one person up?

36:33.120 --> 36:33.960
Let's do it.

36:34.880 --> 36:35.720
All three.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.560
Send it.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.880
I think all three, yeah.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.400
Send it, bro.

36:40.400 --> 36:44.320
Okay, so yeah, with three of you,

36:44.320 --> 36:46.480
it's going to be pretty difficult to be stealthy,

36:46.480 --> 36:48.920
but on the other hand, you're aided in this

36:48.920 --> 36:51.760
by the fact that the person you're sneaking up on

36:51.760 --> 36:53.960
is sound asleep.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.120
So you make your way up the stairs,

36:57.120 --> 36:59.320
which luckily are carpeted,

37:00.200 --> 37:02.360
across the landing,

37:02.360 --> 37:06.040
and the door to the master bedroom is open.

37:06.040 --> 37:10.120
The whole place is fairly expensively furnished.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.400
There's all sorts of object art

37:13.400 --> 37:17.320
and expensive bits of furniture and so on,

37:17.320 --> 37:18.160
but at the same time,

37:18.160 --> 37:21.760
the whole place seems to be the best possible evidence

37:21.760 --> 37:23.480
that money cannot buy taste

37:23.880 --> 37:25.440
because everything just clashes with each other

37:25.440 --> 37:27.360
and it all ends up looking a bit shit.

37:27.360 --> 37:31.720
And you make your way through to the doorway

37:31.720 --> 37:33.040
to the master bedroom,

37:33.040 --> 37:37.880
and there is this really ostentatious four-poster bed there,

37:37.880 --> 37:42.880
and there is a man lying there in maroon silk pajamas,

37:43.720 --> 37:46.160
just lying sprawled across the bed,

37:46.160 --> 37:50.120
snoring away at the top of his voice.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.080
He's a middle-aged man, he's got graying temples,

37:53.600 --> 37:57.360
he's fairly slim, fairly pale as well,

37:57.360 --> 38:00.160
and yeah, he's out for the count.

38:00.160 --> 38:05.160
Melon hands the canister to Coombs.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.160
I take it.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.160
Raises the shotgun.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.960
How's he laying?

38:10.960 --> 38:13.800
Sprawled out, he's on his back,

38:13.800 --> 38:17.280
he's sort of starfished out on the bed.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.240
Gross.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.920
Not a care in the world.

38:19.920 --> 38:24.920
Yeah, I'll just aim the shotgun in between his eyes.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.400
Okay.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.880
Give him a gentle little nudge.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.680
Hey, hey.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.960
And yeah, he's sort of...

38:38.320 --> 38:39.720
His eyes half open.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.840
Hey, sleepyhead.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.680
And he looks up to see three strange men

38:43.680 --> 38:47.880
standing there holding weapons, and he just-

38:47.920 --> 38:50.880
Don't move, there's a knife on your balls.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.120
He just tenses up.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.400
Look, fellas, I don't know what you want.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.880
Look, take anything you want, okay?

38:57.880 --> 38:59.120
Yeah, you want money?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.760
Sure, sure, I got money.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.520
Are you Hiram's old partner?

39:02.520 --> 39:06.320
He looks really confused at this, and he says,

39:06.320 --> 39:08.080
what, Melnick?

39:08.080 --> 39:10.440
Yeah, I know Hiram.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.840
Well, what's this got to do with Hiram?

39:12.840 --> 39:17.840
Not much, except we come from the same Hooverville,

39:19.680 --> 39:22.720
but we're the fuck of the kids.

39:22.720 --> 39:27.080
Good God.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.080
He looks confused for a moment, and...

39:33.400 --> 39:38.400
Look, what, the kids, the kids, yeah, okay, the kids.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.320
You can see him thinking for a moment.

39:44.320 --> 39:48.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the kids, the kids from last night.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.840
Right, yeah, okay, all right.

39:50.840 --> 39:54.160
Then if you want the kids,

39:54.160 --> 39:57.640
yeah, I can tell you where to find them,

39:57.640 --> 40:01.000
but I'll tell you what, you got to do something for me.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
Frederick Mellon I pulls back the thumb fellas

40:07.160 --> 40:09.360
on his double-barreled shotgun.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.720
Yeah, I'll do something for you.

40:11.120 --> 40:14.480
I'll do something for you right now, and it's not kill you.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.120
But unfortunately, what has not happened yet

40:17.120 --> 40:20.200
is that I've not promised to cut off your balls,

40:20.200 --> 40:22.640
so why don't you fucking stop talking?

40:22.640 --> 40:27.640
He said, look, no, no, no, let's make a deal here, all right?

40:27.760 --> 40:31.280
I know, I know who's got your kids.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.760
The deal is that I don't cut off your balls.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.480
I know who's got your kids.

40:35.480 --> 40:38.240
I can make everything right for you,

40:38.240 --> 40:43.240
but, but, but, and you can see gears

40:43.400 --> 40:46.560
kind of clicking over in his head as he's saying this.

40:46.560 --> 40:51.560
Yeah, all right, look, there's a guy who's got your kids.

40:51.560 --> 40:54.840
He's got them in another house.

40:54.840 --> 40:58.680
I'll tell you what, yeah, you let me phone him up.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.680
I'll get him to go over there.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.440
Yeah, he'll let the kids out for you.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.320
But what you got to do for me is, yeah,

41:06.520 --> 41:09.880
you look handy with those guns, with those knives, whatever.

41:09.880 --> 41:13.120
Yeah, I mean, when he goes there to let your kids out,

41:13.120 --> 41:14.960
you do whatever you want with him.

41:14.960 --> 41:18.400
Yeah, I mean, you want to kill someone over this.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.720
He's the one who took your kids.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.480
You just shoot him.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.440
Yeah, yeah, you do that.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.120
Everything's fine, everything's great.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.920
You're saying that this guy is behind the kidnapping.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.280
He's the one that came into our camp and took our children.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.120
Yeah.

41:32.120 --> 41:33.120
And you had nothing to do with it.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.840
They just came to your fucking house.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.760
They just used your property.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.240
What is this fucking canister?

41:38.240 --> 41:40.080
Why don't you tell us what this fucking canister is

41:40.080 --> 41:41.440
that we found in your basement?

41:41.440 --> 41:44.800
He looks really alarmed as you're holding that up.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.120
He says, yeah, you don't want to open that, all right?

41:48.120 --> 41:48.960
What if we do though?

41:48.960 --> 41:51.000
What if we open it right above your belly button?

41:51.000 --> 41:51.840
Yeah, how about that?

41:51.840 --> 41:54.160
What if it goes in right above your belly button?

41:55.840 --> 41:57.400
Do you want to tell us what's going on?

41:57.400 --> 42:00.400
Or do we pour this canister in your fucking abdomen?

42:00.400 --> 42:02.680
Does someone want to make an intimidate roll here?

42:02.680 --> 42:05.800
Yeah, I think this is a very good opportunity

42:05.800 --> 42:07.040
for an intimidate roll.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.000
57 on a 50.

42:13.000 --> 42:13.840
I'll tell you what,

42:13.840 --> 42:17.440
as you are holding this canister above his belly button,

42:17.440 --> 42:19.560
I will let you have a bonus die on that.

42:19.560 --> 42:22.040
Okay, that's just another D10?

42:22.040 --> 42:22.880
Yeah.

42:22.880 --> 42:23.720
Or what is that?

42:23.720 --> 42:24.760
Yeah, it's another D10

42:24.760 --> 42:27.040
and you take that as your 10's result if it's better.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.760
Is it lower than a five?

42:28.760 --> 42:30.040
No, it's five.

42:30.040 --> 42:30.880
Oh, okay.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.120
Same thing.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.440
So you can spend seven luck

42:34.440 --> 42:36.720
and turn that into a success if you want.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.000
I will absolutely do that.

42:38.000 --> 42:38.840
Okay.

42:38.840 --> 42:41.400
I will spend a seven of my 20 luck.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.080
So I'm down to 13.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.320
Fantastic.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.640
Horrifying, that was horrifying.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.520
He's looking really scared at this stage

42:50.520 --> 42:52.160
and he says, look, fellas,

42:52.160 --> 42:55.000
you don't know what you're doing with those things.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.440
Just don't let them out of there, okay?

42:57.440 --> 43:00.800
All right, I mean, I'll take you to your kids.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.960
Why don't you tell us what we're doing with those things?

43:02.960 --> 43:03.800
Why don't you tell us

43:03.800 --> 43:06.600
what you're doing with those things?

43:06.600 --> 43:09.160
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, all right?

43:09.160 --> 43:10.240
Why don't you try us?

43:10.240 --> 43:13.240
Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?

43:13.240 --> 43:17.000
Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?

43:18.120 --> 43:18.960
All right, look.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.720
He says, look, all right,

43:25.240 --> 43:26.680
I'll tell you what I know,

43:26.680 --> 43:30.160
but look, you're not gonna believe any of this.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.560
You guys ever hear of a guy called Aston Hawks?

43:33.560 --> 43:35.200
Have we?

43:35.200 --> 43:38.240
Actually, I think out of all the pre-gen characters,

43:38.240 --> 43:39.720
no, no, you don't.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.560
So no, I mean, you may have heard

43:44.560 --> 43:46.440
a couple of the people around the camp,

43:46.440 --> 43:51.440
maybe Maureen Frayne or Carl Rothstein mention him,

43:53.400 --> 43:56.080
but yeah, I mean, you've heard the name.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.160
Heard the name?

43:57.160 --> 43:58.000
Why?

43:58.000 --> 43:58.840
What of it?

44:00.400 --> 44:03.880
Hawks, Hawks, he built a machine.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.320
Don't ask me how it works.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.400
Yeah, Sedgwick, he's the one who knows all that stuff.

44:08.400 --> 44:11.160
I don't know, I know how to switch it on.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.160
That's about it.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.680
But there's this machine and you turn it on

44:16.680 --> 44:21.680
and I don't know, he says something about higher realms,

44:22.240 --> 44:24.920
higher dimensions, something like that.

44:24.920 --> 44:29.920
All I know is that there are these things on the other side

44:30.560 --> 44:34.960
these creatures and he points at the canister

44:35.880 --> 44:38.960
and it's like we go fishing for them.

44:38.960 --> 44:41.680
We get those, we get the good ones,

44:41.680 --> 44:44.280
we put them in the canister, those ones we can use.

44:44.280 --> 44:49.280
And when we use them, you put them inside someone

44:49.400 --> 44:53.600
and it's like they feed on them.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.360
They feed on something inside them.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.720
But if you're fast, if you're clever,

44:58.760 --> 45:01.480
if you get one that's just fed

45:01.480 --> 45:04.320
and then you put it inside yourself,

45:04.320 --> 45:07.760
it's like everything that it can't digest itself

45:07.760 --> 45:08.920
goes into you.

45:09.760 --> 45:14.600
Wow, so you're literally feeding on the poor.

45:14.600 --> 45:19.600
It sounds so sordid when you put it like that.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.760
After it feeds, does it leave the body by itself?

45:23.760 --> 45:26.520
Does it, is it full and then it leaves?

45:26.520 --> 45:28.080
No, you take it out again.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.480
With the forceps?

45:29.480 --> 45:31.520
Yeah, you don't want to touch those things with your hands.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.200
What happens if it gets out of control?

45:33.200 --> 45:36.240
Well, that's again, that's what the forceps are for.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.520
You don't want to lose control of these things.

45:38.520 --> 45:43.520
So you people did this to the Hooverville on purpose?

45:43.880 --> 45:48.880
Well, not you people, Sedgwick did all of this.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.360
I mean, yeah, it's not me.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.240
Oh, and you just benefited.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.080
Well, wouldn't you?

45:54.080 --> 45:56.920
No, we're trying to stop this fucking thing.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.920
The second we found out about this shit,

45:58.920 --> 46:01.440
we thought it was fucked up and we tried to stop it.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.760
That's the difference between us and you.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.600
Why were these kids in your basement?

46:05.600 --> 46:07.160
The kids aren't in my basement.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.760
No, but they were in your car.

46:09.760 --> 46:12.840
They were dragged here in your car, that's right.

46:12.840 --> 46:15.200
They were dragged here in the car to your yard.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.400
Like I said, it's Sedgwick,

46:18.400 --> 46:20.920
going Sedgwick just got me to drive them.

46:20.920 --> 46:23.000
Oh, you're just as fucking chauffeur now?

46:23.000 --> 46:23.840
Yeah.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.880
Did you get the bugs in your feet or whatever?

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
They went in the doc's feet.

46:29.840 --> 46:33.520
He looks completely and comprehendingly at you.

46:33.520 --> 46:38.520
What I'm asking is have you had the bugs in you?

46:41.440 --> 46:42.280
Yeah.

46:42.280 --> 46:44.960
After they fed on people in the Hooverville?

46:44.960 --> 46:47.160
Look, like I say, you want Sedgwick,

46:47.160 --> 46:49.160
he's the mastermind behind all this.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.240
I've had enough to blow this guy's brains out.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.280
He seems to me like a willing participant.

46:54.280 --> 46:57.360
Yeah, I mean, unless he gives us the address

46:57.360 --> 47:01.240
in like three, two.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.360
Prospect, he says, prospect.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.320
Trigger pulled.

47:08.760 --> 47:12.800
Okay, and shall we leave the session there?

47:12.800 --> 47:14.360
Yeah, it's a good fight, yeah.

47:16.040 --> 47:19.480
As you blow Casper Brinks' brains out

47:19.480 --> 47:21.420
all over his expensive silk sheets.

47:21.820 --> 47:25.620
Oh, holy shit.

47:25.620 --> 47:29.980
Wow, that's awesome.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.780
Let's burn this fucking house down.

47:31.780 --> 47:34.620
We got so much information out of a person

47:34.620 --> 47:36.140
we were about to not disturb.

47:39.740 --> 47:41.340
Well, we don't want to be rude.

47:43.980 --> 47:46.100
He's sleeping.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.180
Shh.

47:47.180 --> 47:50.180
You very politely blew his head off.

47:50.220 --> 47:51.060
Yes.

47:55.460 --> 47:56.300
Wow.

47:57.420 --> 48:01.500
As the shotgun blasts, the upper body of Casper Brink

48:01.500 --> 48:04.660
gets shredded into just so much meat,

48:04.660 --> 48:08.860
bits of him splatter across the four-poster bed

48:08.860 --> 48:12.220
and blood pools into the sheets around

48:12.220 --> 48:16.620
as his carcass just gives its last few twitches on the bed.

48:17.580 --> 48:19.300
Let's have a sanity roll for this bit

48:19.300 --> 48:20.660
of cold blooded murder.

48:23.660 --> 48:24.500
What?

48:25.780 --> 48:29.820
I failed real bad, an 85 on a 37.

48:29.820 --> 48:34.060
Yeah, a 98 on a 75.

48:34.060 --> 48:37.380
Okay, and how about Mr. Dolan?

48:37.380 --> 48:39.380
I rolled an 81, I don't think I passed.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.300
Well, it sounds like each one of you has failed,

48:45.540 --> 48:48.020
in which case let's have a D6 sand roll

48:48.020 --> 48:49.060
for each one of you.

48:51.260 --> 48:52.100
Six.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.100
Ah, six.

48:54.100 --> 48:55.540
I got a five.

48:55.540 --> 48:58.620
Fucking hell, holy shit.

48:58.620 --> 49:01.220
Okay, can each one of you make intelligence rolls?

49:07.900 --> 49:09.460
33 on a 60.

49:10.340 --> 49:12.540
I got 17 on a 60.

49:12.540 --> 49:16.060
That's 15 on a 70.

49:16.060 --> 49:18.060
So you all passed.

49:18.060 --> 49:21.940
Well, it's not very often you have three characters,

49:21.940 --> 49:24.820
the only three player characters in the scene,

49:24.820 --> 49:27.700
go into a bout of badness at the same time.

49:32.500 --> 49:36.020
So what I'm going to say, I'll use the rules

49:36.020 --> 49:39.900
for what happens if a character on their own

49:39.940 --> 49:41.180
has a bout of madness,

49:41.180 --> 49:43.500
but just apply it to all three of you.

49:43.500 --> 49:48.140
So I think given the shock of what's happened there,

49:48.140 --> 49:52.700
and the fact that you perhaps didn't anticipate

49:52.700 --> 49:57.700
just what the consequence of this perhaps rash action was,

49:58.580 --> 50:00.620
a little while later, the three of you

50:00.620 --> 50:05.260
basically find yourself wandering through the Hooverville,

50:05.260 --> 50:10.220
just not really quite able to understand how you got there.

50:10.220 --> 50:11.660
You don't have the shotgun anymore.

50:11.660 --> 50:13.380
You don't know what the hell happened to that.

50:13.380 --> 50:15.780
It could be anywhere at this stage.

50:15.780 --> 50:18.700
The three of you are still covered with a spray of blood

50:18.700 --> 50:21.300
from Brink's exploding corpse.

50:22.500 --> 50:24.700
Your ears still have the echo

50:24.700 --> 50:27.580
of that shotgun blast going in them.

50:27.580 --> 50:32.580
And you perhaps don't really realize what's going on

50:32.660 --> 50:36.460
until, let's say, Professor Rothstein

50:36.460 --> 50:39.940
just sees these three figures come back into the camp.

50:39.940 --> 50:43.460
You're there by the campfire with a few others

50:43.460 --> 50:47.100
having what passes for coffee there.

50:47.100 --> 50:50.500
And you see, yeah, the three who went off earlier

50:50.500 --> 50:52.500
in search of the kids coming back.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.820
They are, like I say, covered in blood

50:54.820 --> 50:58.380
and some stuff that maybe isn't blood.

50:58.420 --> 51:03.100
There's some fleshy bits and fragments of what may be bone

51:03.100 --> 51:04.940
wedged in bits of their clothing.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.220
And each of them just has this vacant look

51:08.220 --> 51:09.820
about their faces.

51:09.820 --> 51:12.500
Hello, what is this?

51:12.500 --> 51:13.340
Come.

51:15.460 --> 51:18.100
I'm looking around at the other people sitting with me

51:18.100 --> 51:20.260
and like wide-eyed.

51:21.220 --> 51:24.780
Yeah, they're all looking at these three in alarm as well.

51:24.780 --> 51:27.580
As Dolan stands there, there's something

51:27.620 --> 51:32.620
that just falls off the lapel of his rather tattered coat

51:33.780 --> 51:35.300
and lands on the ground.

51:35.300 --> 51:38.660
Something kind of gray and spongy

51:38.660 --> 51:40.980
that just bounces on the ground

51:40.980 --> 51:44.140
that looks unpleasantly organic.

51:45.580 --> 51:46.940
Oh my God.

51:48.420 --> 51:53.420
I pour three cups of coffee into like little tins

51:53.460 --> 51:56.660
and just walk over and offer it to them.

51:56.660 --> 51:59.260
I think Nathaniel would like kind of eagerly

51:59.260 --> 52:00.820
grab it shaky-handed.

52:00.820 --> 52:02.620
Technically you're now an accessory.

52:05.260 --> 52:07.460
And he would cup it with two hands

52:07.460 --> 52:10.260
and gently try to suck down some coffee.

52:10.260 --> 52:11.860
Yeah, it tastes nasty enough

52:11.860 --> 52:14.700
that it starts rooting you back in reality.

52:14.700 --> 52:15.540
Are you okay?

52:19.220 --> 52:22.740
Sure, sure, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

52:22.740 --> 52:23.820
Is this blood?

52:23.820 --> 52:26.980
Can we talk in private, doc?

52:26.980 --> 52:27.820
Sure.

52:29.460 --> 52:32.220
And I don't move, I'm standing right by him.

52:32.220 --> 52:34.900
You mean like in your tent or something?

52:34.900 --> 52:37.260
Oh, yes.

52:37.260 --> 52:40.860
I like lead the way to my abode.

52:40.860 --> 52:43.740
Dolan makes a comment like,

52:43.740 --> 52:48.260
shouldn't have picked up that shift at the butchers

52:49.660 --> 52:51.420
to the people around the campfire.

52:52.100 --> 52:55.940
We're all probably gonna go vegetarian.

52:57.220 --> 53:00.660
Dr. Rothstein leads the three of you off

53:00.660 --> 53:04.060
towards his sort of lean-to shack

53:04.060 --> 53:07.340
where you can have a private conversation.

53:07.340 --> 53:11.020
I pull the tarp aside that I'm using for a door

53:11.020 --> 53:13.380
and like usher them inside.

53:13.380 --> 53:15.620
Nathaniel Coombs is gonna try and find

53:15.620 --> 53:18.260
just the nearest seat that he can sit in

53:18.260 --> 53:21.420
and contemplate his existence now

53:21.420 --> 53:24.460
as he looks into his cup of bad coffee.

53:24.460 --> 53:26.900
Frederick Mellon I hasn't come in yet

53:26.900 --> 53:29.100
and you just hear from the other side of the tarp

53:29.100 --> 53:32.540
this dry retching from outside

53:32.540 --> 53:36.060
and he kinda limps and slowly wiping at his mouth.

53:39.580 --> 53:44.580
And then you see his left index finger is just going wild.

53:44.860 --> 53:49.220
The rest of him is very, very steady almost,

53:49.220 --> 53:52.420
like not moving at all, scared to move

53:52.420 --> 53:55.860
but his left index finger just keeps moving.

53:55.860 --> 53:58.740
And how about Mr. Dolan, is he going into the shack?

53:58.740 --> 54:00.260
Dolan goes into the shack

54:00.260 --> 54:04.300
and he's just looking for any kind of water basin

54:04.300 --> 54:09.300
or tub, anything to start washing the viscera off with.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.980
If he can't find it, he just pours his coffee out

54:11.980 --> 54:13.820
on his hands and starts rubbing that.

54:15.020 --> 54:17.460
Yeah, I mean, you can start getting yourself a bit cleaner

54:17.460 --> 54:21.020
at least sort of get some of the bits out of your hair

54:21.020 --> 54:22.700
and beard and stuff like that.

54:22.700 --> 54:23.980
Come in, have a seat.

54:23.980 --> 54:28.980
Carl, we met somebody that they said a name

54:32.380 --> 54:34.700
and it's a name that I've heard you say before.

54:36.100 --> 54:39.540
Hawks and Frederick Mellon just runs over like quickly

54:39.540 --> 54:43.700
to Carl Rothstein, grabs just blood-soaked hand

54:43.700 --> 54:48.700
on your lapel and just holds on less aggressive

54:49.020 --> 54:54.020
than desperate and looks at you with pleading eyes.

54:54.220 --> 54:55.780
Hawks.

54:55.780 --> 54:56.620
Yes.

54:58.100 --> 54:58.940
What?

55:01.140 --> 55:04.220
Yeah, Carl Rothstein immediately thinks

55:04.220 --> 55:07.900
of Professor Hawks and snaps too.

55:07.900 --> 55:09.420
Well, that's good.

55:09.420 --> 55:12.420
Listen, doc, they're putting bugs in people's bellies,

55:12.420 --> 55:14.460
they're laying eggs, they're eating them,

55:14.460 --> 55:15.700
weird shit's going on.

55:15.700 --> 55:16.540
What do you know about it?

55:16.540 --> 55:17.540
Me.

55:19.060 --> 55:20.300
No, the other doc.

55:20.300 --> 55:21.140
Me?

55:21.140 --> 55:22.500
Yeah, you.

55:22.500 --> 55:26.900
Rothstein, it seems like you might be stalling.

55:26.900 --> 55:28.340
Stalling, no, I'm-

55:28.340 --> 55:30.220
Yeah, what did you just walk into the situation

55:30.220 --> 55:33.300
without any prior knowledge? I'm just very confused.

55:35.380 --> 55:36.660
Let me check my notes

55:36.660 --> 55:38.900
and see if I have anything about this.

55:39.420 --> 55:43.180
He walks over to a desk on the back.

55:43.180 --> 55:46.140
It's called a book called Memories

55:46.140 --> 55:48.660
and he clips through it.

55:50.860 --> 55:53.700
Austin Hawks, that's the name we heard

55:53.700 --> 55:55.380
and I've heard you mention it before.

55:55.380 --> 55:56.380
Who is he to you?

55:56.380 --> 55:58.940
I was friends with Professor Hawks,

55:58.940 --> 56:01.740
but he disappeared.

56:01.740 --> 56:03.380
This might sound like a funny question,

56:03.380 --> 56:05.100
but when he disappeared, did it feel like

56:05.100 --> 56:07.620
any of your greatness disappeared with him?

56:08.340 --> 56:11.060
I mean, look at me now, of course.

56:11.060 --> 56:14.020
Oh, but this was years before the depression

56:14.020 --> 56:14.900
that he disappeared.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.740
He disappeared something like eight years ago.

56:17.740 --> 56:19.260
A question retracted, doc.

56:19.260 --> 56:21.020
I'll forget you ever even asked it.

56:21.020 --> 56:21.860
Sustained.

56:23.340 --> 56:26.660
I mean, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

56:26.660 --> 56:30.660
I mean, he used to live in the Prospect Estate with Crawley

56:30.660 --> 56:31.980
and was last seen there.

56:31.980 --> 56:34.420
Yeah, just read from your book of memories over there.

56:34.420 --> 56:37.860
Nathaniel's eyes widen, prospect, prospect.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.500
And he's looking at his other guys.

56:39.500 --> 56:44.340
Have you men been to a different dimension?

56:44.340 --> 56:47.260
We suspect not, but that some kind of creature

56:47.260 --> 56:49.980
from a different dimension, you know, is like.

56:49.980 --> 56:53.300
The canister, where's the canister?

56:53.300 --> 56:55.340
Oh, fucking shit.

56:55.340 --> 56:56.180
Nice.

56:57.820 --> 56:59.580
Do we at least have the forceps?

57:00.940 --> 57:02.180
Nope.

57:02.740 --> 57:03.580
God.

57:03.580 --> 57:05.700
We must've left it all back there.

57:05.700 --> 57:06.540
Oh God.

57:07.820 --> 57:11.100
I don't know where we would've, why we would've, I don't.

57:11.100 --> 57:11.940
Well, I mean, it's not like

57:11.940 --> 57:14.180
he's over there futzing with it, you know.

57:14.180 --> 57:16.700
Frederick Mellon the first checks his pockets

57:16.700 --> 57:19.940
for keys to a big black Cadillac

57:19.940 --> 57:22.860
that he's really hoping that they took with him.

57:22.860 --> 57:25.540
Well, I'll tell you what, give me a luck roll

57:25.540 --> 57:28.780
to see whether you picked up the keys.

57:28.780 --> 57:31.180
I have 70 luck.

57:31.220 --> 57:32.860
And I, oh, I passed.

57:32.860 --> 57:34.260
I was really scared, I was gonna say that

57:34.260 --> 57:36.460
and then still fail, 50.

57:36.460 --> 57:39.340
Then yeah, you do check your pockets

57:39.340 --> 57:41.900
and you do find the keys to the Cadillac in there.

57:41.900 --> 57:43.300
And an ear.

57:44.420 --> 57:45.260
Yes.

57:48.980 --> 57:51.820
And he holds them both out in one hand.

57:51.820 --> 57:54.460
We were at Greenleys, we were at Greenleys

57:54.460 --> 57:56.780
and we followed that big black caddy out there.

57:56.780 --> 57:58.900
Ida told us at the Blue Star Diner,

57:58.900 --> 58:00.580
that's what led us all the way out there

58:00.820 --> 58:02.340
and then we decided we heard the man sleeping

58:02.340 --> 58:04.900
and we thought, oh no, forget it, you're home to Bel Air.

58:04.900 --> 58:07.020
And we said, let's go upstairs and maybe check on him.

58:07.020 --> 58:09.980
But then we killed him and now he took his car.

58:09.980 --> 58:11.540
Okay, so if we have his car,

58:11.540 --> 58:13.380
we'll be able to get back there pretty easily

58:13.380 --> 58:14.700
because we need that canister

58:14.700 --> 58:16.020
and we probably need the shotgun.

58:16.020 --> 58:17.340
Maybe he's got other stuff too.

58:17.340 --> 58:19.340
We can disguise ourselves with his clothes

58:19.340 --> 58:21.540
and maybe other guns that he might have,

58:21.540 --> 58:23.020
recheck his basement perhaps,

58:23.020 --> 58:24.140
but maybe we don't have time

58:24.140 --> 58:25.500
because we need to get the prospect.

58:25.500 --> 58:27.580
Oh, fuck Carl, are you gonna come with us?

58:27.580 --> 58:29.020
Please help.

58:29.020 --> 58:33.460
Carl is standing in his little shack

58:33.460 --> 58:37.740
surrounded by these men covered in goo and blood

58:37.740 --> 58:38.700
and who knows what.

58:38.700 --> 58:42.660
And he's wide-eyed the entire time

58:42.660 --> 58:44.620
that Frederick is saying that.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.580
If you need my help, I'll come.

58:49.580 --> 58:50.420
I'm not sure.

58:50.420 --> 58:52.180
He doesn't seem convinced yet, Carl.

58:52.180 --> 58:54.980
Dr. Coombs, please tell him about the creatures.

58:54.980 --> 58:55.900
Tell him about the creatures.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.100
Tell him how fucked up it was.

58:57.100 --> 58:58.380
The creatures, listen, Carl,

58:58.380 --> 59:00.140
the long and short of it is we've killed tonight

59:00.140 --> 59:01.140
and we'll kill again.

59:03.980 --> 59:05.220
Who did you kill?

59:07.940 --> 59:09.660
You if you don't come with us.

59:09.660 --> 59:11.620
Whoa, what?

59:12.660 --> 59:13.820
Are you serious?

59:13.820 --> 59:16.020
Carl, do you know where Prospect is?

59:16.020 --> 59:17.700
I want to say yes.

59:19.620 --> 59:21.020
Then do it, man, damn it.

59:21.020 --> 59:22.620
It's a couple of miles from here.

59:22.620 --> 59:24.820
It's a couple of miles down the road towards Arkham.

59:24.820 --> 59:29.300
Of course, I mean, are you going to hurt me?

59:29.300 --> 59:30.540
Not if you take us there, doc.

59:30.540 --> 59:32.740
Okay, how do you suppose we get there?

59:32.740 --> 59:34.620
Frederick holds up the ear.

59:34.620 --> 59:35.580
I mean the keys.

59:37.260 --> 59:42.260
Okay, yeah, if you drive, I can show you the way.

59:42.820 --> 59:47.060
Maybe you can fill me in on some stuff on the way.

59:47.060 --> 59:47.900
I doubt it.

59:50.780 --> 59:53.420
The car, which is parked at a crazy angle

59:53.420 --> 59:56.100
on some waste ground between the main road

59:56.100 --> 59:58.420
and the shanty town.

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.660
As long as there's no cops around it,

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:05.300
then Frederick turns back and is like,

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.140
hey, and if we're super lucky, then maybe in the trunk,

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.260
there's a shotgun and a canister of void fish.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.900
Of what?

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.860
I was just calling them void fish.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.780
What a void fish.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.180
Well, they lay eggs.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.860
That's about all we know of their biology.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.340
I'm from a void and I'm a big adventure zone fan.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.180
All right.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.180
Okay, I'm going to sit in the passenger seat

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.540
and you just tell me when you're ready.

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.380
Oh, that's good.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.500
Cause I got that one all bloody on the way over here.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.340
So I'm going to sit in the back in the first seat.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:39.540
What I'd like at this stage then is a group luck roll.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.340
So whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.660
guests make a luck roll.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.940
I think that's Thomas.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.460
He spent seven on the 20 he had.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.100
Oh God. So he's got 13.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:51.940
Yeah.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.980
I'm not sure how much,

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.940
cause I got a bonus for a little bit.

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.500
Did that get taken away from me?

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.180
No, no, you still have that.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.940
Okay. Then I've got 25.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:01.660
All right, Thomas, you got this.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.900
All right, here it goes.

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:05.420
85.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.700
Hell yeah, dude.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.620
Okay.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.460
So as you're getting into the car,

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.220
there's no sound of the shotgun,

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:17.220
but you do see that the canister is there in the back seat.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:18.380
At some point.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.220
Is it open?

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.740
At some point it seems to have got open.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.740
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.780
Is it, is it sitting open as we get in the car or is it?

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:31.620
Oh yes.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.580
Is it resealed?

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:33.420
It's sitting up.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.980
No, no, it's sitting there on its side in the footwell,

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.500
the top of it off.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.340
Yeah.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.380
Can we do a search or spot hit and roll for any of these,

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.860
these creatures in the car?

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.860
You certainly can.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.140
Like lurking under the seat.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.420
Or inside of us.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.180
I pass 43 on a 55.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:55.580
You do see something gray

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:59.260
as wriggling underneath one of the seats.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:04.260
You also notice a trail going through the undergrowth

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.420
away from where the car is parked,

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.020
heading in the direction of the camp.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:10.860
Oh shit.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.380
That is very, very not good.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.620
Well, look on the bright side fellas,

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.940
we let it escape, but we do have the canister,

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.420
so we can't recontain it.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.980
Are there forceps there?

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.820
No.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.900
Doc, you took a Hippocratic oath,

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.220
so I nominate you to grab the creature when we find it.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.700
Yeah, just scoop it.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.900
I'm sitting in the passenger seat.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.580
I'm finally like soaking in some blood that was on it

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.180
and like feeling wet.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.220
And I hear that.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.340
Whatever you need, just.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.580
That's wicked good of you, Doc.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.820
It's for mankind.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.140
Okay.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.540
Keep in mind when we say Doc,

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.380
we're talking to both Doc Combs and Doc Rothstein

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.220
at the same time.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.420
I felt like I dodged a bullet there, yeah.

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.260
Thanks.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.180
I'm not gonna go around thinking of two names for doctors.

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.100
I mean, you were obviously out of it for a while.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:11.300
At this stage, it is beginning to get dark.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.020
So are you following the trail of this thing

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.180
back towards the camp?

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.940
Are you staying in the car

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.540
and trying to deal with the thing that's loose there?

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:23.580
Are you finding another way of getting into prospect?

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.900
What's your plan?

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.260
This Austin Hawks guy, we were told he built some machine.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.460
I think it's this thing that brings these creatures in.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.460
He might have more sophisticated ways of capturing them.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.220
When you got a problem, you gotta root it out at its source.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.060
Otherwise, the little fingers that go out in the toes

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:43.620
that spread their little wormy ways into the world around it

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.220
will just continue to grow and grow.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.300
If you cut off one finger, then you got nine left.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.980
But if you cut off two hands at the same time,

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.340
then you got no fingers.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.980
I think we should find this thing

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.420
before it infects the camp.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.940
I think we should probably help the people.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.340
It doesn't seem like a finger.

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.980
It seems more like its own thing

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.540
that can operate independently of a hand.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.980
Maybe we should help the people real quick.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.500
Because the big fancy place, that's not going nowhere.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.220
But this thing's on the move.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.260
How would we begin to find it?

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:22.660
It seems to have left a pretty clear trail, right?

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:23.500
Yeah.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.380
You've noticed, certainly,

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.380
there's some of the undergrowth that's been disturbed

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.460
and it is leaving a fairly subtle trail of slime,

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.940
which you've managed to spot.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:36.820
Like I say, it is beginning to get dark at this stage.

01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.380
You're gonna have to try to find it fairly quickly.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:42.580
Otherwise, you're going to lose it in the dark.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.940
I thought my analogy was great,

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.300
but I'm easily persuadable.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:46.980
Let's search for this thing.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.380
So you carry on following this trail

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.300
and it goes up to one of the tents.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.940
And you realize, yeah, it's the tent that Nancy Carver

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:01.260
was in earlier, the woman who'd seen the weird stuff

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:06.260
last night and had gone into some kind of fugue stated

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.340
as a result.

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.940
And this thing just goes up to the fabric

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.380
on the side of her tent.

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.500
And then there's just this wet spot in the fabric

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.860
of the tent as if it's moved through it.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:20.780
Yuck.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.900
Wicked yuck.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.700
That's a no from me, dog.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.180
Should we look around in the tent?

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:33.180
Nancy, Nancy, you in there?

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:36.660
You can hear the sound of someone breathing heavily

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.580
as if they're sleeping.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.940
And as you shout her name, she stirs a little bit

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.940
and her first reaction is a sort of whimpering sound.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:51.700
And then she says, who is it?

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.580
We got faces, I'll tell you that much.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.100
It's Fredrick Mellon I, Carl Rothstein, Thomas Dolan,

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.900
and Daniel Coombs.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.980
That's two doctors, we're very legitimate.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.260
We're here to check up on you, Nancy.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.460
We know you had quite a day yesterday.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.620
I just need to sleep.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.980
I need to sleep.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.900
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.260
But we're worried about a situation

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:15.940
that has come to become a present issue.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:19.220
If you could come on out, please, or allow us to come in.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:21.380
There's a bit of movement inside

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:26.380
and she staggers up to the door of her tent

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.060
and opens it up.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:35.020
And yeah, she's looking very pale in the fading light.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.020
Her eyes are a bit unfocused,

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.460
her hands trembling as it's holding onto the tent flap.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.340
What is it?

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.180
What do you want?

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.420
Excuse us for one moment, Nats.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.980
Could we huddle real quick?

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.700
So she's got it, right?

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.780
She's, it's, that's-

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.460
Yeah, it's inside of Lee.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.300
Yeah.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.420
What is inside of her?

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:05.780
It's a void fish, if you like, a space bug.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.540
You can pick your own name for it.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.900
Okay, how do we get it out?

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.300
They enter the body,

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.260
but the problem is they don't leave a sign

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.180
that they've entered the body.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:18.780
It's almost like it creates a camouflage of the wound.

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:19.820
A wet door.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.420
How do you know she's got it?

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.540
It makes you look like that.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.380
Look at her.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:29.380
Oh, okay, so do we kill her?

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:34.820
No, I think we gotta take her with us to a place.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:35.660
Thank God.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.580
Thanks for asking, though.

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.380
I did not want to do it.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:45.380
I know, but sometimes you just have to in these situations.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:51.380
I don't, I don't know about that.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.300
The thing here that we've learned is that

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.060
they put these in and then take them out of people.

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.700
So there's a way to do it safely.

01:07:59.020 --> 01:07:59.980
Doink doink doink doink.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:04.580
Do either one of you have any forceps in your shanty tent?

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.420
I probably do.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.140
Any sort of metal grabbers?

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:10.940
I'm a physics professor, so no.

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.620
So no physical objects then?

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.420
Dr. Coombs would have something suitable

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.940
in his medical shack.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.580
I've got some forceps.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.940
And I do, I run back and I also,

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.340
if I can find a pair of gloves,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.660
I'd like to grab some gloves.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:26.060
Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.220
As you go in, Maureen Frain is coming out of,

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.740
well, she was obviously sleeping before

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.700
and her eyes open up as you come into the shack.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.580
And she looks like, oh, Dr. Coombs, have you got news?

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.660
Have you found Esther?

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.900
We're working on it.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:46.740
We think we're on the right track.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.580
We don't have any reason to believe

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.860
something bad has happened per se yet at all.

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:57.060
And we're gonna find her.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.740
She starts trying to get out of her bunk

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.140
as if to try to come and help you

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.780
and then just collapses back into it.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.740
You need to get some more rest there, Maureen.

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.620
That's what's gonna make you feel better eventually.

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:15.500
All right, but do get her back safe, please, Doctor, please.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.260
We're on it.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.860
And yeah, I'm going for forceps and gloves.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.700
Yep, you can grab those and head back to Nancy's tent.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.660
When I get back to the tent, I say,

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.340
there's a chance Maureen has it too back at my place.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.940
But I got the forceps and the gloves.

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.940
So what, do we just start poking around on her

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.020
and find the wet door?

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:34.540
Yeah, I'm not sure how to go about this.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.740
We gotta go to the place

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.540
and find the people who are doing this.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.140
What, no, Dolan, you just said

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.580
that we needed to fix the situation here at home.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.780
And now as soon as we find the situation,

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:49.340
you're trying to bail out? No, no, no, I said

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.180
we need to track down the creature.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.140
We found where it is.

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:53.980
We know exactly where it is.

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:56.140
It could easily leave her once it gets full

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.700
and then find another person.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.900
Then when we get back, it's somewhere else.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.020
Although I guess it would have given that person strength.

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.940
I'm really not sure how to say it.

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:07.580
Are you having this conversation in front of Nancy?

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.980
Yeah.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.940
Probably actually.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.900
Yeah.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:16.180
Okay, her eyes are getting wider and wider and wider.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.420
I'm sitting down next to Nancy's,

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.060
just kind of like holding her up

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.260
and taking all of it in with her too.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.780
Carl, Carl, what are they talking about?

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.380
What are they talking about?

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.220
Everything you saw was real.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.660
Oh God, oh God.

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.700
I think there's some kind of parasite in the camp.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.060
And do you think it's gotten to me?

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:38.900
Yeah.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.140
Oh, I think I might have it too.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.140
You'll be okay.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.300
Yeah, I've got one too.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.940
It's just going around.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.540
We've all had it, Nance, and we survived,

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.660
but we gotta figure out how to get it out of you.

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.180
That's why I think, Freddie, that we need to go,

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.740
you know, like you said earlier to the source.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.300
I hope you know this isn't a flip flop.

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.020
This is a fluid situation is what they call it.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.020
Yeah, no, 100%, I agree.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.500
I was right at the beginning too.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.740
So what do I do if I've got this parasite inside me,

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.780
what do I do about it?

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.820
How do I get it out?

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.100
Ah, just take a nap.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.740
We're working on how to get it out,

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.580
but just so you know, you've got time.

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.140
I've seen this before.

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.460
There's no reason to think

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.260
that you're in any immediate danger.

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.140
We'll figure out how to get it out of you

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:22.180
and then we'll get it out of you.

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.500
It is imperative that you realize you will be fine.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.540
It just takes your potential and your ability and your joy

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.260
and it gives it to somebody

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.700
of a better social standing than you.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:33.540
Is this what-

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.100
Harold Priestley lived for what, like a week or two?

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.940
Yeah, is this what happened?

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.140
Before he became Crumbly Dust?

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.500
This is what happened to Harold.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.700
I heard, I heard-

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:42.740
Yeah, 100%.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.580
I heard his face fell off.

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.940
Oh yeah, it was gross.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.780
That wasn't the end stage though.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.940
We believe we've caught it.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.460
Yeah, we believe we've caught it pre-face crumble.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.260
So you just hold on tight, Matt,

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.540
take a little nap and we're gonna get you fixed up.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.420
Be sure and drink lots and lots of water.

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.100
That's what the crumbling was from a lack of water.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.260
So just make sure you're keeping the fluid intake.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:07.940
Oh, and by the way,

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.380
if you see a little buggy crawl out of you-

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.220
Stop that.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.180
Maybe don't-

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.780
Don't stomp it, burn it.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.620
Right.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.420
Oh yeah, with fire, kill it with fire.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.780
None of this seems to be comforting her in the slightest.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.060
Really?

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:22.900
Scott, really?

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.260
Some people just can't be reasoned with,

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.740
so it's not really my fault.

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.740
It's like when you see a snake and it bites you,

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:34.340
you grab it so that you can identify what snake bit you.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.780
It's the same thing.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:39.500
Well, doc, like we said, you don't wanna grab it.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.300
It can move through your skin.

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:45.180
It will just in a you if you grab it, so.

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.020
Then how do you-

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.540
On stage, Nancy is just curled up on the pile of newspapers

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.020
and old grags that she's using as a bed

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.540
and is in the fetal position

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.780
and is just curled up around herself, shaking.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.780
That's good, that's self-care.

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.460
You're doing it right, Nancy, that's good.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.140
We'll be back as soon as we can

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.580
and we'll get this figured out for you.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:08.260
Don't worry, you're in capable hands here with Dr. Coons.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.300
And Nancy, remember, you still owe me a can of beans,

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.380
so when you get over this, don't forget.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:19.380
Doc, as a physician-

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.460
Yes, that's what they call us.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.580
Yeah, don't demoralize the patient.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:29.340
Oh, I'm giving her a reason to live, to pay her debts.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.380
To feel good.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.420
That's what America's all about, baby.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:38.300
That's a very Teutonic perspective.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.860
I came to a capitalist country

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.740
and, you know, it's treating me, you know, ill enough.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.580
He laughs and looks around like very sad.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.780
We should get to Prospect.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.700
Yeah, now that you've completely destroyed

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.540
Nancy Carver's spirit,

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:04.020
you're heading back off towards Prospect, are you?

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.380
Yeah, you're right, Thomas Dolan.

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.140
That was a very good idea.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.580
We isolated a variable.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:14.940
I'm not gonna apologize for demystifying the situation.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:17.260
I wasn't being sarcastic.

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:18.540
Now she won't run away.

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:22.020
There was still, last time you checked,

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.260
one of these things loosened the car as well.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.580
You did see it wriggling under one of the seats.

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.500
And we left it there.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.900
Oh yeah, whoops.

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:29.740
All right.

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:33.020
I think Carl agreed to try to scoop it.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.420
So when we get back to the car, is it still there?

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.260
Well, let's have a group luck roll

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.700
to see whether it's still there.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.060
So that's just Thomas.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:41.900
On me again?

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:42.740
Yeah, all right.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:49.420
21, so I've been so close without that modifier.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.820
In which case, hmm, no.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.260
By the time you get back to the car,

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.620
I think it is quite gloomy now,

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.460
but you don't see any trace of it.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.260
And now I'm gloomy,

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.300
because I just know I'm gonna sit on it.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.700
How big are these things?

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.500
The one you saw wriggling under the seat

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.500
was probably about the size of your forearm.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.340
Oh, Jesus.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.820
Okay, so not too small.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.180
I'm gonna get in the driver's seat this time.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.740
When you're ready, I will drive there.

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.820
Frederick Mellon I tosses you in here.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.500
It disgusts me.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.340
Oh, whoopsie.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.580
It comes back to me that you were covered in blood and stuff

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.820
and I'm scared, very scared again.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.260
Sorry about that.

01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.140
Toss me the keys.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.220
I'm like shaking and start the car.

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:42.140
I feel like I'm being taken hostage almost.

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:43.980
Yeah.

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.620
I want to note that I still got forceps with me.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.020
So if anything goes down, I can still maybe help.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.180
Man, those are nice gloves.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.540
It doesn't take you very long

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.700
for Dr. Rothstein to drive you to Prospect,

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.740
because like I say,

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:01.300
it is just a couple of miles down the road.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.660
As we're on our way,

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.580
as we're passing Blue Star Diner,

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.660
should we,

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:09.900
boys, should we stop and grab that shotgun at Greenleys

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.220
or are we completely fucked regardless?

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:14.180
Well, from, I mean,

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:15.340
from one point of view,

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.260
it's already served its purpose in the story,

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.220
but it could be,

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:22.980
could still be useful, I don't know.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.620
After your experiences of the trauma

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:29.460
after murdering Mr. Brink,

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:32.900
are you really happy going back to the murder scene?

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.740
Carl, can you get something for us?

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:40.660
I would be afraid you'd use it on me, so no.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.340
You can hold it.

01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.500
I'd rather not.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.980
It's good you don't want your prints on there.

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.820
That's smart.

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.740
That's why I adopted.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.540
It seems like you may have done something horrible

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.460
with it as well.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.980
So preferably not.

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:56.060
I don't know about you guys,

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.980
but I don't really remember what happened after all that.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:01.140
There's a chance that we left the shotgun in the woods

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.140
somewhere on our way back.

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.140
I don't know where it might even be in there.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.300
Let's not waste time.

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.940
Let's just go get some answers.

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.900
Yeah, it is.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.860
It is almost dark now

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.100
and there are still two missing children.

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.060
I hope we don't feel like we needed that shotgun later.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.340
I'm sure you'll be fine.

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.700
Yeah, Prospect, huh?

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.460
So yeah, you drive the couple of miles up the road

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.820
towards Prospect.

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:34.300
So this is another one of these estates like Greenlee's

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.380
that's set back from the road.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:40.860
This one though does have a stone wall around the grounds.

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.940
You pull the car up to the gates outside

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.380
and the gates are a bit rusted.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:50.820
There is still in Gothic script written over the top

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:55.140
of the metal gates in wrought iron, just the word Prospect.

01:17:55.140 --> 01:18:00.140
And in the dying light, you can see the perhaps ruins

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:05.420
or not quite ruins, but the abandoned house itself

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.340
up at the top of the slope.

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:12.060
The grounds in this light look incredibly overgrown.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.740
You can also just through the gates,

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.100
make out some outbuildings,

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.740
but you're not quite sure what they are.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:25.300
The gates themselves have got a chain

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.380
and a padlock around them.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.020
While the gates are fairly rusty,

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.700
the chain and padlock look quite new.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.380
Well, that's one of the new ones.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:40.380
And you know, ever since they got this new lock mechanism,

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:44.420
gizmo technology, it takes maybe a second or third try

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:47.180
here and there, but I'm pretty good with these

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.060
and starts rooting around in his clothes,

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:53.140
finding his like lock picking set.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.980
Okay, yeah, give me a locksmith roll

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.180
to see what you can pop it easily.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.020
A 10 on a 70.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.220
Oh yeah, well, the chain looks solid.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.340
They clearly used a cheap lock here.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.220
So you pretty much just slide the picks in

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.900
and the whole thing pops open.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.060
And he turns around and he's like,

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.940
that's one of the most advanced locks

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:15.300
that exists here in this time period.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.780
And your boy, Frederick Mellon, the voice,

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.660
got it while winking at you, huh?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:20.500
And he winks.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.940
Thomas Dolan winks back with a little song on his fiddle.

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.300
I forgot about that film.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.700
So did I, I just saw it on my character sheet.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:33.180
But yeah, you get the gates open.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.580
Are you leaving the car on the road?

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.820
Are you driving it up towards the house?

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.580
But do you want me to do drive it up?

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.940
They'll think Casper's coming

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:46.940
and Casper seemed to have an issue with Sedgwick.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.740
I think he wanted us to kill him, honestly.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:53.420
He seemed like he really would have been cool

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:55.460
with us knocking him out.

01:19:55.460 --> 01:20:00.460
So if I were Sedgwick and I saw Casper bring his car

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:04.620
coming up, I would feel uneasy about that and negative.

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.540
And then the fact that he's not even in the car,

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:10.860
maybe we could play it off like we killed him for Sedgwick.

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:13.100
Like we heard that they were having issues

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.540
and we wanted to join in on the madness.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.260
I don't know.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.220
What do you guys think?

01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:20.740
We don't know for sure that Sedgwick is here, right?

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.620
This is Austin Hawk's house.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.740
Maybe he's a live-in helper with the machine.

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:26.580
That could be.

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.500
With a machine like that,

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.180
I don't think that the man who knows how it works

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.820
would be too far away.

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.980
I'm worried about the going in part,

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.540
but it would be nice to have a going out ride.

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:38.380
Does that make sense?

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.900
I'm worried that it's really conspicuous

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.260
for our car to go up the driveway,

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.580
but I'd love to have a car ready to go down that driveway

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.740
when we were trying to leave this place.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.940
It's a pretty nice car.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.100
It's the Depression.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:52.460
I think going up in this nice car gives us some good cover

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:54.860
on the way up there and gives us an escape route.

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.660
I think we take the car.

01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:57.980
We just back it in.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:02.260
Yeah, you make your way up the driveway.

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:05.220
I mean, it's going to be quite difficult to back it in

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.580
because this is a winding driveway

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.620
and it's quite badly overgrown.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.900
The weeds are quite high on the other side.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:16.780
It's going to be tricky because with it getting dark,

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.580
you probably want the headlights

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.580
pointing in front of you at the moment

01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.420
to avoid crashing into a tree or a sapling or something.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.620
I mean, if you really want,

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.140
I can give you a drive auto roll

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.660
just to reverse it in there,

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.940
but it is the harder way of doing it.

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.540
I think we should just go in straight on.

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.140
There's surely a roundabout it,

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.940
but these estates all have those trees.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:39.820
I'm a good driver.

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.340
I'll back it in.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.180
Okay.

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.060
You give me a drive auto roll then.

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:48.380
Okay, let me see what my drive auto is.

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.460
God damn it, Luke.

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.460
Yeah.

01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.340
Like surely he wouldn't just say that.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.860
It's not on my character sheet,

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:02.060
so I think it's just a 20.

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.220
Yeah, so that means it's 20.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.060
Yeah.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:05.900
Sweet.

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:06.740
You dick.

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.220
41.

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.780
How much luck do you have?

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.020
20.

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:11.860
Fuck.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.900
So you reverse the car up and about halfway up,

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.380
like I say, it's very badly overgrown

01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:21.860
and you just misjudge it slightly

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.260
and you've gone off the path or at least off the driveway

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:31.140
and you're reversed into some soft ground

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:36.020
and the car is now sort of, yeah,

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:40.900
stuck in this slightly marshy ground just to one side.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:42.020
Is this a good spot?

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.940
Yeah, if we just like throw something

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.540
under the back tires then, you know,

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.780
it'll be ready for takeoff and we can head out.

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:52.940
Something like you, Kyle.

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:54.380
That was my plan.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.980
Not me though, no.

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.820
Ha ha.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:57.660
Ha ha.

01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.860
So you're getting out to try to put something

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.420
under the back tires so you can get out.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.420
It's now pretty dark.

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:08.020
There's still a little bit of light, but not very much.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.740
It hasn't been raining today,

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.620
but as you brush up against something undergrowth,

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:17.620
some of it does feel uncomfortably moist

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:21.620
and you can hear just the sounds

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.300
of things rustling around in the undergrowth,

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.620
things you can't see in the darkness.

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.020
Boys, I think we should run.

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:35.100
Thomas Dolan is just booking it for the house up the road.

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:35.940
Okay.

01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:38.020
He starts running when he hears the Slytherin.

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:38.900
I'm not giving up.

01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.900
We'll deal with Dolan in a moment

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:43.900
as he's separated himself off from the others.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.220
The other three of you are still there at the car.

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:51.340
So is it Frederick Mellon I and Dr. Coombs

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:55.780
who are trying to help get the car out of the quagmire?

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.260
Yeah, yes indeedy.

01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.660
Yeah, as you're kind of digging around,

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.820
trying to find solid stuff to put under the tire,

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:06.340
a couple of times, yeah, you can feel things

01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:09.260
in the darkness just kind of slithering

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.660
across the back of your hand.

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:13.780
You can't see what they are.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.340
Nathaniel, when one of those slithers

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:19.300
perfectly across his hand, he jerks back.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.180
For Frederick, there's stuff out here.

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.900
There's that crickling sound.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.140
That's not squirrels.

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:27.100
It was slimy.

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.820
Yeah, it's making my stomach hurt when I think about it,

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.500
but eh, we got to keep going.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.220
We got to make sure the car gets out.

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.940
That way we can bail effectively.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.460
In which case, yeah, if you're grabbing stuff

01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:44.100
to put under the tire, part of that is going to involve

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:49.100
lifting the car up enough to get the stuff under the tire.

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:55.100
What I suggest then is one of you give me a strength roll

01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.020
just to see whether you can pull this off.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.860
They look at each other.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:03.020
All right, young man, I think that's on you.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:08.540
I pass, a 19 on a 50.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:09.900
Yes.

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:10.740
Oh, nice.

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.660
Okay, so yeah, you think you've managed to get enough stuff

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.780
under there and sure enough, when Dr. Rothstein starts up

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:20.140
the car, it just pulls forward onto the track.

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:23.300
Now, Mr. Dolan.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:24.140
Yes.

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:28.420
Mr. Dolan was running up towards the house in the gloom.

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:30.380
As you make your way towards the building,

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.420
from the undergrowth, just after your right,

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.020
you hear a sound.

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.340
The sound, you're not quite sure what it is at first,

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.260
but as you move past, you can hear a sort of

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:43.260
a sound,

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.980
and it's just going on and on.

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.900
Can I see anything?

01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:06.540
No, it's coming from the undergrowth,

01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.940
and it's getting quite dark.

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.180
Hello?

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.140
Oh.

01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.820
Hey there, are you a missing child?

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.300
I'd really like to find and comfort you if you are,

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.940
but there's some freaky shit out here.

01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.020
Oh, God damn it, Thomas.

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:39.460
All right, and he goes into the,

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.780
he goes towards the sound.

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.660
Nice.

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:48.180
Okay, so just as the other three of you are heading up,

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:52.460
you sort of just catch sight in the gloom

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:57.060
of Thomas disappearing off the path into the undergrowth

01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.660
and disappearing out of sight.

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.900
Oh, Thomas, there's stuff out there, I wouldn't...

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:02.260
Yeah, that's why I ran,

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:05.300
but I think one of the kids is over here.

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:06.900
Can you give me a spot hidden, Roy?

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:07.900
Wicked scared.

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.020
23 on a 25.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.660
Oh!

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.500
Nice.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.220
So the moon is beginning to come up at this stage,

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:20.980
so you've got a bit of light.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.900
In the little bit of light you have,

01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.900
you see the form of someone lying just on the ground.

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:32.740
You can just make out a human shape.

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:35.580
It's too big to be one of the children.

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:38.180
It looks like an adult, probably a man.

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:42.140
He's lying on the ground and he seems to be trembling

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.580
and he's still making that sound, that...

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:48.260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:50.740
I'd like to try to find a stick and poke him.

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.100
You grab a stick off the ground.

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:58.100
It's slightly moist and yeah, you poke him

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:02.700
and he doesn't seem to react.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:05.140
I think he's still going, oh, oh, oh.

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:06.980
In fact, actually, as you poke him,

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:10.260
his head does turn slightly towards you.

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:13.060
And as he arrives, we're adjusting to the moon

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.620
that's now risen a bit more.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:19.340
You can make out some of the contours of his face.

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:21.060
His face is quite wasted.

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:25.380
He looks really drawn and sick.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.780
His eyes are absolutely wide.

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.660
And as he's staring at you,

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:34.660
you see his right eyelid bulge slightly.

01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:37.700
And then something crawls out from underneath it,

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:42.060
something wriggling that's just glinting in the moonlight

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:45.420
and crawls across his eyeball and across his face

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.420
and then just disappears up his nose.

01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:52.620
I just throw the stick at him and run back to the path.

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.460
Let's have a sanity roll first.

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.620
We're gonna find a way to help y'all.

01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.740
So, yeah, sanity roll.

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.700
Another 23.

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:01.540
And your sanity is?

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.780
On what was my sanity?

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.740
No, my sanity is 40.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:08.900
And I took, I don't remember how much damage I took, six.

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.580
So my sanity is 34.

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:11.420
So I passed.

01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:13.420
And so, yeah, I mean, you still, like you say,

01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:16.060
throw the stick and sort of back off in horror,

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.340
just almost tumbling over on the ground

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:20.220
in your speed to get away.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.420
And yeah, as you run through the darkness,

01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:25.860
through the undergrowth, you can feel

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.860
sort of the wetness of these strands of weeds

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.180
as they brush against your face.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.460
And you think you can feel things wriggling on them

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.100
as you brush past them.

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:41.660
And then, yeah, you just stumble out onto the track again

01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.500
as the others are there.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.500
There's a guy on the trail, off the trail,

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.540
he's real messed up.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:51.220
Let's get to prospect proper and solve this mystery.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.060
What do you think?

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.180
Does he need medical attention?

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.140
Do I need to?

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.060
Not right now.

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.140
I think we just gotta move on.

01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.140
He's got bugs coming out of his head.

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:04.700
I think we gotta find a more holistic solution

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.860
to this problem before we can help him at all.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:12.300
Well, prospect itself is just 20 yards

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.300
further up the track from here.

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:16.540
As I said, though, there in the moonlight,

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.580
you can see that there are a couple of outbuildings.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:22.740
Well, first of all, let's just make clear,

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.620
there is no artificial light here whatsoever.

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.060
The only light you have is the moonlight.

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:34.060
Prospect itself is a fairly big sort of neocolonial house.

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:39.420
It looks like there's the remains of a sort of

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:43.260
extensional wing on the far side of it from here.

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:46.660
The front door looks like it's a jar,

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:50.660
but off to the side, there are a few outbuildings.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.580
There are some things that look like sheds,

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.660
albeit large sheds,

01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:57.340
but there's another building that's a bit odder than that.

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:02.140
It's a stone building that is around

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:05.700
maybe about 10 yards in diameter,

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:09.220
maybe a bit larger, a one-story building

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:12.780
that's just set back to the left of the main building.

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:15.100
Are there any vehicles parked anywhere?

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.380
Not that you can see.

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.740
Would we have, like, our torches with us?

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:19.860
Let's have a group luck roll

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.220
to see whether you thought to bring them.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.980
I'm really sorry I joined back with you guys

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:26.940
before you decided to check on that.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.340
LAUGHING

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.060
Oh, no.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:33.900
80.

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:38.660
So, no, to be fair,

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.060
you weren't in your proper state of mind before.

01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:43.140
It's been a day full of shocks.

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.980
At this stage, obviously it has occurred to you

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:47.500
that it would be a really good idea to have light sources,

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.340
but your mind just wasn't in that space earlier.

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.500
Typical Freddy.

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:54.660
So full of regret.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.220
All right, well...

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.700
Oh, guys, by the way, this is the prospect.

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.220
This is where we're going.

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.140
I forgot to announce when we got here.

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:05.940
Thank you so much, Karl Rothstein.

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:06.780
Thank you for all your help.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.300
I'm so glad we brought you.

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.220
Jesus fuck.

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:10.460
Karl, do you have any idea

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.660
what that weird round building there might be?

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.700
Oh, let me think.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.620
You think it might be,

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.780
and not that you ever saw it,

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:24.020
but it was something that Dr. Hawkes had talked about,

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:27.980
that he was going to build a separate laboratory,

01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:31.100
and you think that might be it?

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:33.420
I mean, it still looks like a fairly unusual building.

01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.900
It doesn't necessarily look like what you'd think for a lab,

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.740
but maybe that's it.

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:41.580
It may be his lab.

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:45.580
I remember him talking about building a lab.

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.740
It looks like it could be that,

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.460
but I'm turning Irish.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:50.300
I don't know.

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:53.340
It's hot, man.

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:54.340
It's wicked hot.

01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:58.060
Being from anywhere these days is difficult.

01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:59.860
How do you keep a hold of your own identity

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.100
in a world like this?

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.980
Should we check out the lab?

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:08.540
That might be where equipment is for this.

01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:10.100
Do you think we should start there?

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:11.980
I feel like it's been presented.

01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.340
I think we start there.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.460
I think we figure out how to help

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:21.140
and try to stop whatever's happening first,

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.540
because if we find the children first,

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:28.820
then we would just be carrying or bringing along children

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:32.660
into whatever dangers we might be presented later on.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:33.580
Good point, good point.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.140
Speaking of carrying things,

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:37.460
shouldn't we carry that guy to the lab?

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:38.300
No.

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.860
The guy from the woods back there?

01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:40.700
Yeah.

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.540
No, man.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:42.380
My whole point-

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.940
The whole idea is to find the shit to help him.

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.940
And then not have dead weight with us.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:49.660
If it's in the lab, then it saves us a trip.

01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:50.620
Thanks, Thomas.

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:53.140
No, Carl, I don't think we need to drag the guy

01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.580
full of bugs by hand back here.

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:56.540
Okay.

01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.420
After we just fled from him and Tara.

01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.460
Let's check out this laboratory.

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:01.300
What about you?

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.380
You're a doctor, don't you have an oath?

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.740
No, yeah, that's why I asked,

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.860
but when you said the bugs thing,

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:08.420
I've seen what those bugs can do.

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.460
I'm not touching it until we figure out a way

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:13.300
to contain those things more efficiently.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.140
Okay.

01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:16.100
And you're off existence, so.

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:17.660
This has nothing to do with me.

01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:20.020
A phys-iks-ion.

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:20.860
You're a doctor.

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:21.700
Yeah, you said it right.

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.380
You said you're a doctor, so.

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:24.980
Okay, let's go to the lab.

01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:29.700
So you walk over to this stone building.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:33.540
Yeah, it's got a fairly heavy iron door on it,

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:37.020
black iron door, that again is locked.

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.780
You can also see that in the moonlight,

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.780
there are some fairly heavy looking cables,

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.980
half buried running across the ground,

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:51.900
that are running over towards the two shanks.

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:53.100
If only we had the shotgun,

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.060
we could be blasting all these locks.

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:58.620
Well, we don't need a shotgun for the locks,

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.220
but it'd be nice to knock out some of these cables

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.820
and people.

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:06.100
All right, I'm gonna unlock the lock

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:09.700
with a 16 on a 70.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.100
Oh yeah. Hard success.

01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.260
Okay, yeah, yeah.

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.100
I mean, this is a bit more of a serious lock.

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.980
It takes you a minute or two,

01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:20.980
but even then, you pop it open and yeah, the doors open

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:24.780
and inside everything is completely dark.

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:26.620
There's no light in here.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:31.020
You can hear towards the back, a sloshing of liquid.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.700
There's a strange smell in the air

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:39.140
and you can see shapes just all around in the gloom.

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:47.140
Life's surreal, in retrospect a dream.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:53.140
Easy times feel less than serene.

01:35:53.140 --> 01:36:00.140
In the moment it's hard to count your blessings,

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:07.140
so we long for days gone past us.

01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:16.140
Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
