00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Well, well, well.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.440
Hello all my beautiful babies.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.600
It's your spectral guardian, Wolf the Dog,

00:08.600 --> 00:14.840
the DJ at the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP.

00:14.840 --> 00:18.120
Let's not dilly-dally and go ahead and jump

00:18.120 --> 00:21.240
into everyone's favorite part of the show.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.520
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Sam Witch,

00:24.520 --> 00:27.720
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:27.760 --> 00:32.080
A thing you should do, lest your blessed internet guests

00:32.080 --> 00:35.400
guess that your zest for ingesting my jests

00:35.400 --> 00:37.680
has been wrested from your chest.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.480
But I digress.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.560
Sam Witch writes,

00:41.560 --> 00:45.000
Wolf the Dog, I have followed every instruction

00:45.000 --> 00:47.520
you've given to the letterer every week,

00:47.520 --> 00:50.400
telling those that would be to my left and to my right

00:50.400 --> 00:55.960
to keep the radio dial tuned to 694.2 PTBP,

00:56.040 --> 00:58.960
despite there being none other than me

00:58.960 --> 01:01.480
in this near featureless void.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.080
You, Wolf the Dog, are the only exception

01:05.080 --> 01:08.440
to the otherwise unending monotony.

01:08.440 --> 01:12.360
Thus to you I plead, please, Wolf the Dog,

01:12.360 --> 01:16.280
be my lifeline back to the extensive library

01:16.280 --> 01:19.080
that led me here with its yellowed pages

01:19.080 --> 01:22.520
and please be quiet signs.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.480
No, that's okay, Sam Witch.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.240
I don't think I have time to do

01:30.240 --> 01:33.040
whatever it is you just asked me to do,

01:33.040 --> 01:36.320
but have fun whenever and wherever you are.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.200
Ta-ta for now.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.720
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

01:41.720 --> 01:45.240
come on, say it with me in your brain space.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.840
Tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram

01:48.840 --> 01:51.800
and tag pretending to be people on Facebook

01:51.840 --> 01:53.640
or write up a five star review

01:53.640 --> 01:56.160
on the podcast app of your choice

01:56.160 --> 01:59.680
and make sure the proof comes across my desk.

01:59.680 --> 02:04.080
Oh, and by the way, I heard what y'all did.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.680
I heard y'all raised almost 800 bucks

02:07.680 --> 02:10.520
and I heard those nasty boys

02:10.520 --> 02:13.880
from pretending to be people rounded up, matched it

02:13.880 --> 02:17.680
and sent a total of $1,600

02:17.680 --> 02:19.880
to the crisis cold weather shelter

02:19.880 --> 02:24.880
in their hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.000
Damn y'all, what a good job y'all did.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.640
My producer's eye caverns have filled with salty water

02:33.640 --> 02:36.800
because of the good y'all helped us spread

02:36.800 --> 02:40.560
and no matter what kind of water fills your holes,

02:40.560 --> 02:43.600
there's always the news.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.840
Last time, Cal reached out to his contact

02:46.840 --> 02:49.680
in the city PD, Chief McMillan,

02:50.360 --> 02:54.000
to find out more information about the un-uniformed gobs

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
that stole footage from Vivica at the Cannes station.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
The two officers showed up in CPD cruiser number 836

03:03.600 --> 03:07.080
and Chief Mac used cop net to identify them

03:07.080 --> 03:11.320
as officer Richard Riley and officer Wilson Wiley.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.160
Tithe Rayland texted his employee and nephew,

03:15.160 --> 03:18.160
Julius Summers and asked him to come back

03:18.200 --> 03:22.480
to the Cannes station soon to meet in Tithe's office

03:22.480 --> 03:24.720
and to bring Beck and Cal.

03:24.720 --> 03:29.120
After a quick stop at Riley and Wiley's local drinking hole,

03:29.120 --> 03:33.240
which is of course called W-A-R-E-R-We,

03:33.240 --> 03:36.640
we're at Bucky's Kids Bar, duh,

03:36.640 --> 03:40.460
the Cannes crew was able to bribe the night manager

03:40.460 --> 03:43.120
for Riley and Wiley's addresses.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.960
But at that same moment, Tithe texted again,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.440
more impatient this time,

03:49.440 --> 03:53.240
requesting the team's presence in his office.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.520
Speaking of presence, here's a true gift,

03:57.520 --> 04:02.240
a brand new tune, just for you my favorite listener,

04:02.240 --> 04:04.360
my widdle baby.

04:04.360 --> 04:07.500
Shh, don't tell anyone else now,

04:07.500 --> 04:12.500
it's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

04:13.140 --> 04:17.140
And it's all my fault

04:17.140 --> 04:22.140
Cause my life is great

04:22.140 --> 04:24.140
And it's all mine

04:31.500 --> 04:36.500
Cause my life is great

04:36.500 --> 04:39.500
And it's all my fault

04:42.500 --> 04:47.500
And it's all my fault

04:50.100 --> 04:52.420
Hey Luke, who was your favorite teacher?

04:52.420 --> 04:56.420
My favorite teacher, probably Jesus.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.860
Joe, write that down.

04:57.860 --> 04:58.740
Jesus?

04:58.740 --> 05:01.620
My first pet named after my favorite teacher.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.780
Jesus, Jesus, okay.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.020
The street you grew up on?

05:04.020 --> 05:09.020
Uh, oh crap, I was trying to think of like a-

05:09.300 --> 05:12.620
Golgotha, Jesus.

05:12.620 --> 05:15.420
I don't know enough about the Bible to have made a joke.

05:15.420 --> 05:17.500
That's the hill that he was crucified on.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.940
That's the hill he died on.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.220
And he stayed dead.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.740
Dude, I was laughing the other day.

05:24.740 --> 05:29.740
Actually, there's some debate on that last point.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.300
I saw somebody be like, I saw somebody online be like,

05:34.300 --> 05:36.460
I was online, somebody was like,

05:36.460 --> 05:38.540
so wait, he came back from the dead,

05:38.980 --> 05:40.340
so he didn't die for our sins,

05:40.340 --> 05:42.780
he like took a weekend off for our sins.

05:44.660 --> 05:46.780
I'm not really familiar with the text, but he's like-

05:46.780 --> 05:48.660
He died, he went to hell.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.980
I don't ask me why he went to hell.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.820
He stole the gates.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.700
No, not the gates, that would be too much.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.380
He stole the keys to the gates of hell.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.780
It would be too much for him to carry.

05:57.780 --> 05:58.620
Far too much.

06:02.180 --> 06:04.900
Luke, this doesn't sound made up, hear him out.

06:06.140 --> 06:07.660
So he goes to hell.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.060
It does sound like a set up for a joke.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.660
Okay, so Jesus dies, he goes to hell.

06:11.660 --> 06:12.700
He steals the keys, not the gates.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.340
It sounds like a good-ass comic book.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.460
I get why all those people tried to turn the Bible

06:16.460 --> 06:17.280
into a comic.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.620
Yeah, from hell.

06:18.620 --> 06:21.700
Yeah, Alan Moore's adaptation.

06:22.620 --> 06:23.460
I want that-

06:23.460 --> 06:25.580
Wait, so did Jesus really go to hell?

06:25.580 --> 06:30.020
There are many eye witnesses to-

06:32.780 --> 06:35.140
There are many sex knights of Christianity

06:35.140 --> 06:38.340
who do believe that Jesus went to hell and stole the keys.

06:38.340 --> 06:42.380
And so they just made that up and they say it

06:42.380 --> 06:43.220
and that's what they believe.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.540
So you worship a thief?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.660
Wow.

06:46.660 --> 06:50.260
I believe they say multiple times that Jesus will come back

06:50.260 --> 06:52.940
like a thief in the night for his followers.

06:52.940 --> 06:54.580
I want that shirt that says,

06:54.580 --> 06:57.020
if Jesus comes back, we'll kill him again.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.220
I want Jesus to come on my back like a thief in the night.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.700
Is this an ad for Roman?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.620
Did I show you guys the shirt that I bought

07:04.620 --> 07:06.320
based on an Instagram ad?

07:06.320 --> 07:07.700
Yes, you did.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.540
I cannot wait to get that one.

07:09.540 --> 07:11.740
Do you want to tell people what it is?

07:11.740 --> 07:15.160
It's like a weird green monster guy on the phone

07:15.160 --> 07:16.500
kind of like kicking back.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.460
And it says, if you don't like my attitude,

07:18.460 --> 07:20.980
call 1-800-EAT-SHIT.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.740
Were you gonna wear that to the Christmas

07:24.740 --> 07:25.780
you can't go to?

07:25.780 --> 07:29.380
I was hoping that I could.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.180
Now I'll just have to wear it to a client meeting.

07:31.180 --> 07:32.780
No, just have to wear it, yeah.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.540
On the family Zoom call.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.580
No, it's not Christmas time.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.340
It's January, mid January.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.320
How's sober January going for you guys?

07:41.320 --> 07:42.160
What's that?

07:44.540 --> 07:46.660
It's December, but I already stopped mine.

07:46.660 --> 07:50.020
I don't decide what my new year's resolution

07:50.020 --> 07:54.380
is gonna be until, you know, usually January 3rd, so.

07:54.380 --> 07:56.580
Mine's jerk off every day.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.300
How are you doing this year?

07:58.300 --> 07:59.500
In 2022.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.260
It's the same one every year.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.220
Yeah, you're down six days from 365,

08:03.220 --> 08:04.980
so we're rocking 359.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.680
How many times have you KO'd?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.460
Wait, say the first part again.

08:08.460 --> 08:12.740
Well, there's probably been around 358, 359 days this year.

08:12.740 --> 08:15.340
I would say maybe not every day,

08:15.340 --> 08:19.280
but at least enough to average one a day.

08:22.820 --> 08:24.900
Couple Tuesdays pulling some heavy weight there.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.040
Yeah, a couple Threesdays and Foursdays.

08:31.260 --> 08:35.620
Thomas, how many times a day do you jerk off?

08:35.620 --> 08:36.540
Average.

08:36.540 --> 08:37.500
Average.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.140
Or weird.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.300
Yeah, at least.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.640
I'm gonna say my-

08:45.640 --> 08:47.940
No, no, no, say the number that makes you feel weird

08:47.940 --> 08:48.860
in a day.

08:48.860 --> 08:50.420
I haven't found that number yet.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.540
I'm proud of each and every one of them.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.540
No, no, no, by weird I mean lightheaded.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.740
The limit does not exist.

09:01.260 --> 09:02.100
Yeah.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.620
One of my favorite Christmas movies.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.660
Oh my goodness.

09:12.660 --> 09:13.500
Die hard.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.620
Have you guys watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas movie?

09:16.620 --> 09:17.460
I did, yes.

09:17.460 --> 09:18.540
Was it bad?

09:18.540 --> 09:19.380
Top notch.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.460
Like recommend or like it's fine that you watched it?

09:22.460 --> 09:24.180
On my belt.

09:24.180 --> 09:25.020
On my belt?

09:25.020 --> 09:27.420
Yeah, I had to notch it all the way up.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.520
Real tight.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.940
Did you really watch it?

09:31.500 --> 09:32.340
Yeah, I did watch it.

09:32.340 --> 09:33.180
It was on at my house.

09:33.180 --> 09:34.980
I didn't put it on.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.060
Probably your dumb wife.

09:36.060 --> 09:39.180
My dumb, I couldn't even say it.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.220
Taylor, my extremely intelligent and compassionate wife.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.320
Who does dumb shit?

09:48.900 --> 09:50.800
I think it was either her or Lindsay,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.460
another one of our guests here at Pretending to be People.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.700
Another one of my wives.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.800
They put it on when we were hanging out

09:59.800 --> 10:01.760
and then I think they hung out

10:01.760 --> 10:04.800
and I watched the Lindsay Lohan Christmas film.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.440
Is it like, I've been told it's like Hallmark vibes.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.360
It very much is a Hallmark movie.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.160
It's just on Netflix, yeah.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.280
She bonks her head, forgets who she is.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.800
The guy that she falls in love with

10:15.800 --> 10:17.660
is technically taking advantage of her

10:17.660 --> 10:19.820
because she knows how much money she's worth.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.200
When you say technically,

10:21.200 --> 10:23.040
do you mean he still actually really loves her?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.680
Oh, defo.

10:24.680 --> 10:27.700
I saw one on Peacock called Love on Rye

10:27.700 --> 10:31.900
and this Jewish matchmaker sets these two people up

10:31.900 --> 10:34.660
and then the drama is that they find out

10:34.660 --> 10:37.620
that they operate competing delis.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.300
And that is not made up.

10:42.860 --> 10:44.920
Wait, is this a non-fiction or fiction?

10:44.920 --> 10:45.760
TBD.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.540
I think he's asking is it reality or?

10:49.540 --> 10:50.780
That is what I was asking.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.620
And that's what I was answering.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.620
That's historical fiction is what Luke means.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.180
Based on a true story probably.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.900
Yeah, Argo style.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.940
Sounds like it's based on You've Got Mail.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.980
It's called Hanukkah on Rye.

11:02.980 --> 11:03.980
What did you say it was?

11:03.980 --> 11:04.860
Love on Rye?

11:04.860 --> 11:07.620
Yeah, I was wondering if that was like a play on words

11:07.620 --> 11:08.580
for something.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.420
Well.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.900
Let's dive into this motherfucker.

11:10.900 --> 11:11.720
Let's do it.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.560
Dive on in.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.660
Let's do a bit of a dive in then.

11:14.660 --> 11:15.500
Dive.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.220
Let's do a dive into the pool.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.900
Hey, remember what we said earlier about Scottish accents.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.000
Oh, I said I was gonna do a dive into the pool.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.740
Yeah, there you go.

11:29.740 --> 11:31.540
As long as you're respectful.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.980
It's deeper than four feet gonna do.

11:33.980 --> 11:35.260
What's four feet?

11:35.260 --> 11:38.180
Don't you mean a meter and a half?

11:40.660 --> 11:42.940
Oh, this pool is about a fortnight deep.

11:42.940 --> 11:44.660
Bet I can dive in here.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.100
Dive on in.

11:48.100 --> 11:53.100
You guys were on our way to talk to one of the

11:53.220 --> 11:55.660
Richard or Wylie?

11:55.660 --> 11:56.820
Or say their names.

11:57.660 --> 11:59.460
Richard Wylie and William Wylie.

11:59.460 --> 12:00.500
Wilson Wylie.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.660
Nice.

12:01.660 --> 12:06.380
Wilson or Richard and we've got a date with Uncle Tife.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.700
You do have a date with Uncle Tife.

12:07.700 --> 12:11.200
You've been out and about today going from place to place.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.320
I believe you started over at Vivica's apartment,

12:14.320 --> 12:16.860
headed on back to the can station,

12:16.860 --> 12:19.940
which then led you out to a bar.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.080
What was the bar called?

12:21.080 --> 12:23.700
There was a little stop off there in between those

12:23.700 --> 12:26.500
down at the park to visit an old friend of Cal's.

12:27.060 --> 12:27.900
That's right.

12:29.220 --> 12:31.860
An eloquent, well-spoken gentleman.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.100
An articulate gentleman.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.820
And he gave you the names of the...

12:36.820 --> 12:37.660
He gave the names.

12:37.660 --> 12:39.660
He gave us the names and he also said that

12:39.660 --> 12:44.660
15 to 25% of his force were not cops, but gops.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.460
Cops on the Godel payroll.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.760
Which led us to, where are we?

12:50.760 --> 12:53.460
Spelled W-A-R-E in the dare font.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.740
We're at Bucky Kid's bar.

12:55.780 --> 12:56.620
Duh.

12:58.140 --> 13:00.580
Where we spoke to Bucky Kid's kid.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.420
That's right.

13:01.420 --> 13:04.300
Who pointed us to Lulu, the night manager.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.140
L-E-A-U-X.

13:05.140 --> 13:05.980
Lolo.

13:05.980 --> 13:06.800
L-E-A-X.

13:06.800 --> 13:07.640
Is it Lolo?

13:07.640 --> 13:08.700
It's Lolo.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.820
Pardon me.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.220
He pointed us towards Lolo, the night manager

13:12.220 --> 13:16.900
of where are we, we're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.600
Which started out, no one liked that.

13:22.140 --> 13:24.240
And I think it grew on us a little bit.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.680
I'm fine with it, as long as you're the one

13:27.680 --> 13:29.280
who remembers how to say it.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.480
It's like Wawa KBD, right?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.600
Or B-K-B.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.000
Wawa book-ba.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.580
I don't know any of the stuff you just said.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.420
Where are we?

13:40.420 --> 13:43.280
We're at Bucky Kid's bar, duh.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.720
Wawa book-ba-da is what they call it for short.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.820
Easily remembered.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.040
Anyway, then we called Lolo.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.400
He hooked us up with a couple addresses.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.500
After Cal.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.600
Called him.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.440
And.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.540
Tricked him.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.380
And.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.680
Didn't trick him so much.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.520
Fin modem?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.520
Fin modem.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.980
Yes, sometimes you must grease the palms of truth.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.760
And then I think we took off towards one of the addresses.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.080
We benevolently said whichever's close to us,

14:14.080 --> 14:16.600
so you can give us the character you want us to meet first.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.960
And on the way there, Tife texted Julius,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.880
said, hey, get here soon,

14:21.880 --> 14:24.040
but we got a date for 45 minutes.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.840
Yeah, and what are we supposed to meet Tife about?

14:25.840 --> 14:27.120
I don't think we know, I think he just.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.240
He just said he wants to talk to us.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.480
Yeah, and I mean, you went into the office for a little bit.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.520
You didn't talk to Tife.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.680
He hasn't seen you around.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.120
It's been a minute since you've seen Tife,

14:37.120 --> 14:39.400
so he's probably just curious.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.600
Didn't we tell him, though, that we were trying,

14:41.600 --> 14:42.720
that we didn't have the footage

14:42.720 --> 14:44.000
and we were trying to get the footage back?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.680
He at least knows what we're out and about doing, I think.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.400
Zach said he's probably just curious,

14:48.400 --> 14:49.840
so it's.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.280
I told him I was working out,

14:51.280 --> 14:53.800
that's why I couldn't meet with him then.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.640
It's like, I gotta see my cousin's hot gym bod.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.520
I don't know if we did, did we tell him about the footage?

14:59.520 --> 15:00.360
I don't know if we did.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.720
I feel like we did, I feel like we told him

15:01.720 --> 15:04.640
that that's why we didn't wanna meet him right away,

15:04.640 --> 15:06.160
is that we were trying to get it back.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.040
Didn't we say that to him?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.680
I told him I was working out.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.760
You knew that you didn't trust him.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
I don't think we told him.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.240
Okay, I thought we did, but it doesn't matter either way.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.560
He'll ask us where it is if we get there.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.840
In that moment, two possible realities were created.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.600
So we'll be playing two different stories

15:25.600 --> 15:26.800
from here on out coming out

15:26.800 --> 15:28.520
on still the biweekly schedule.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.480
It might get a little wild.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.240
And who knows, maybe we'll go back and forward in time.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.280
Oh, god.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.360
Oh, timey-wimey?

15:35.360 --> 15:36.360
Oh, timey-wimey.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.160
If you're gonna spend any amount of time

15:38.160 --> 15:41.040
at Richard Riley or Wilson Wiley's home,

15:41.040 --> 15:43.080
you're not going to be able to visit there

15:43.080 --> 15:45.360
and make it back to the can station

15:45.400 --> 15:47.000
in time for the meeting with Tyfe.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.840
So you have a choice at this point.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.000
You can either show up early for the meeting

15:51.000 --> 15:53.320
or you can go to one of these homes

15:53.320 --> 15:55.640
and then show up late to the meeting.

15:55.640 --> 15:56.480
What was the urgency

15:56.480 --> 15:58.200
in getting to these places right now?

15:58.200 --> 15:59.240
To get our footage back.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.320
Yeah, we were trying not to show up empty-handed at least.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.800
Yeah, have the footage when we go to work.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.120
I think we were pretty heavily headed in the direction

16:07.120 --> 16:09.560
of talking to one of them before we go to the meeting.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.400
Yeah, I think so too.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.600
I just don't know.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.480
Joe doesn't know what we're gonna do

16:14.520 --> 16:16.600
when we get to one of these places.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.480
Looking at these names,

16:17.480 --> 16:20.160
I wonder if he had a voice plan for Richard Riley

16:20.160 --> 16:21.680
and then he's just gonna do it again

16:21.680 --> 16:24.440
with like a lisp for Wilson Wiley.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.240
It seems like his style.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.680
Don't call me out like that.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.940
Guys, we're supposed to meet with Tyfe in 45 minutes,

16:34.940 --> 16:38.640
but I think I can hold him off if we're a little late.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.160
Let's go to Wilson Wiley's.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.680
Brrrrrr.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.520
Arghhh.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.080
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.020
Beep beep.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.840
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.740
Watch you crazy motherfucker.

16:49.740 --> 16:50.820
Ahhh-ooh-ha.

16:52.820 --> 16:56.400
You are in the downtown area.

16:56.400 --> 17:01.400
The apartment for Wilson Wiley is in a nice tall...

17:03.280 --> 17:04.360
Yeah, do you like that?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.800
What's this neighborhood called?

17:05.800 --> 17:08.280
Oh, the downtown area.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.640
Hahaha.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.360
It's a hot July day, midday, rolling into downtown,

17:13.360 --> 17:16.520
skyscrapers towering on either side of you.

17:16.520 --> 17:21.520
You continue in Cal Colorado's beautiful Mercedes C-Class

17:22.000 --> 17:24.640
with a, what was it?

17:24.640 --> 17:28.820
A red siren on top with Bluetooth speakers,

17:28.820 --> 17:32.600
and Julius is in the back watching Cloud Atlas.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.440
Hahahaha.

17:35.360 --> 17:39.160
If he had his earbuds out, he would hear Cal Colorado

17:39.600 --> 17:41.240
talking loudly over the radio and saying,

17:41.240 --> 17:42.200
do you like this Beck?

17:42.200 --> 17:44.080
It's the Blues Brothers soundtrack.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.120
Yeah, man, it's...

17:45.120 --> 17:47.200
Well, Blues Brothers 2000.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.440
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say it's a classic,

17:49.440 --> 17:51.480
and that's, I mean, it's got its things too.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.320
Yeah.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.140
Yeah.

17:53.140 --> 17:53.980
No, that's a good one, yeah.

17:53.980 --> 17:55.040
I like it.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.200
It's good, yeah.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.360
Is Rubber Biscuit on that one?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.760
Oh, no, that's on the first one.

17:59.760 --> 18:00.900
Oh, yeah, okay.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.900
Yeah, yeah.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.680
I mean, they do a really, really energetic cover

18:06.680 --> 18:08.040
of funky Nassau.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.000
All right, yeah.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.600
I can get into it.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.440
That's kind of at the end, though,

18:11.440 --> 18:14.160
where it's, I don't think we'll get to it on this trip.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.000
Okay.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.080
You should really experience it in order.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.160
Did we start at one?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, yeah.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.200
Or is this where you left off last time you were in here?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.320
We're on two.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.960
Listen, after we finish, we'll watch the movie together.

18:24.960 --> 18:25.860
No, I've seen it.

18:25.860 --> 18:27.280
Wait, hook?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.100
Hook.

18:28.100 --> 18:28.940
Hahahaha.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.960
Julius pauses the movie and takes his earbuds out,

18:34.960 --> 18:38.040
and it's kind of like looking very inspired.

18:38.080 --> 18:41.000
What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.400
And then they pull up to Wylie's house.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.160
Which is an apartment.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.860
Oh, beautiful da, downtown area,

18:47.860 --> 18:49.920
but that's what they're calling it.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.040
I thought that park got cut.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.240
Yeah, probably did.

18:54.240 --> 18:59.240
So you guys pull into a underground parking lot

18:59.240 --> 19:04.240
for an apartment building in the downtown area?

19:04.260 --> 19:05.100
Da.

19:05.100 --> 19:05.920
Da da.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.680
And it's like really nice.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.960
This is suspiciously nice for a cop.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.680
I think we're dealing with a cop here.

19:14.680 --> 19:15.520
Indeed.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.480
There's plenty of visitor parking

19:17.480 --> 19:21.240
and an elevator that leads you up into the building.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.560
His apartment's on the eighth floor.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.240
Just want to point out that we made our way downtown.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.080
Hahahaha.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.560
Making our way to the downtown area.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.680
Driving fast.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.680
Looking for Wilson Wylie.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.520
And now I'm in the dock.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.240
We've got Cloud Atlas.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.840
Da na na na na na na na na.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.680
On the DVD.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.560
Da na na na na na na na.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.400
Funky Nassau.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.240
And Tom Hanks.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.400
Funky Nassau.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.900
And Oprah.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.740
Was she in that?

19:46.740 --> 19:47.800
She's thinking of the color purple.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.640
Dammit.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.040
What do you think Cloud Atlas is?

19:50.040 --> 19:50.880
Hahahaha.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.960
Tell me right now.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.600
First thoughts.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.920
I'm picturing looks like Lake Tahoe.

19:58.920 --> 19:59.760
Nailed it.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.520
Unfortunately not.

20:02.520 --> 20:03.960
That's a really good guess.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.280
That's a good stab in the dark for any particular,

20:08.280 --> 20:09.320
like I don't know what that is,

20:09.320 --> 20:10.840
but that's not Cloud Atlas.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.880
About a map maker who lives in...

20:12.880 --> 20:14.480
That's closer.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.040
Okay, a map maker?

20:16.040 --> 20:17.560
No, but like a...

20:17.560 --> 20:19.440
So you guys get out of the C class

20:19.440 --> 20:21.840
and head over to the elevator.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.720
There's a doorman who's actually stationed down

20:25.720 --> 20:28.560
in the parking area and he greets you

20:28.560 --> 20:29.500
and he's just like...

20:29.500 --> 20:30.340
Eighth floor?

20:30.340 --> 20:31.160
Eighth floor.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.120
Yeah, of course.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.600
And he clicks the up button on the elevator.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.800
Who are you going to visit?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.280
Oh, just an old friend.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.340
What is your name, sir?

20:38.340 --> 20:39.240
Dave.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.220
Dave, I'm Cal Colorado.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.560
City Action News.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.320
Whoa, that's right.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.080
I knew you looked familiar.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.400
How are you doing today, Dave?

20:47.400 --> 20:49.260
Wow, better now, sir.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.720
Got any news for me?

20:51.720 --> 20:54.240
Well, well, we might.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.520
Let me just say we might.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.360
Hm hm hm hm hm hm.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.760
But that's not what we're doing here today.

20:58.760 --> 21:00.840
Again, this is just an old family friend

21:00.840 --> 21:01.800
we're checking up on.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.720
Well, of course, you all have a lovely day.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.700
You too, Dave.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.760
I stay waving until I'm sure the elevator doors have closed

21:08.760 --> 21:09.640
and he's gone down.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.320
The elevator doors have closed.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.160
You are going up.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.920
He has stayed in the same spot.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.960
Oh, I thought he was on the elevator with us.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.120
He decided not to ride.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.360
No, he was on the outside of the elevator.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.200
He's in the...

21:20.200 --> 21:21.680
I thought he was in it with us also.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.720
Oh, then I guess he's in the elevator.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.720
Eighth floor, huh?

21:27.720 --> 21:28.560
Yeah, I thought we...

21:28.560 --> 21:30.360
I'm not so much an elevator attendant

21:30.360 --> 21:31.920
as a parking garage kind of guy.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.520
There's a way to make this work in the edit

21:33.520 --> 21:35.080
without us saying anything else.

21:35.080 --> 21:35.920
Hahaha.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.600
As the doors open to the eighth floor,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.080
you see a beautiful carpet.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.980
It's got scenes of the jungle on it.

21:46.980 --> 21:49.280
So there's lots of different plant life

21:49.280 --> 21:52.120
and animals kind of drawn into it.

21:52.120 --> 21:53.760
And the scene's kind of carpet

21:53.760 --> 21:55.440
like at the Springfield airport.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.600
I'm thinking Zach just watched the intro

21:57.600 --> 21:59.120
to season one of White Lotus.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.440
I just watched season one of White Lotus last year.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.980
It was really good.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.040
Was there animals?

22:05.040 --> 22:06.280
I don't remember.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.560
Yeah, the intro is just images

22:08.560 --> 22:10.120
of everything Zach just described.

22:10.120 --> 22:10.960
Okay, so it's that.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.920
It's the White Lotus season one intro.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.680
It was the carpet that you used for that intro.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.680
Well, I was just thinking about it.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.520
Hahaha.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.280
And there's...

22:21.280 --> 22:22.680
You can support the podcast on Patreon

22:22.680 --> 22:24.660
if you want more content like this.

22:24.660 --> 22:27.100
There's sconces on the walls

22:27.100 --> 22:28.980
in between each of these doors

22:29.820 --> 22:31.500
that are considerably far apart.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.780
So like White Lotus 2.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.260
The sequel.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.500
The sconce is in.

22:39.940 --> 22:44.380
Okay guys, we need to find apartment 80085.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.180
I bet it's going to be 836.

22:46.180 --> 22:49.060
Well, let's check the text message and see.

22:49.060 --> 22:51.340
When you go to the text, guess what it is?

22:51.340 --> 22:52.180
836.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.380
It's boobs.

22:53.380 --> 22:55.220
It's boobs.

22:55.220 --> 22:57.580
Yeah, it's apartment 836.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.100
What are we going to say to him?

22:59.100 --> 23:01.020
Cal bangs on the door.

23:01.020 --> 23:04.820
Cal Colorado, give me back my footage you son of a bitch.

23:04.820 --> 23:05.660
Hello?

23:06.620 --> 23:07.460
Oh fuck.

23:07.460 --> 23:11.060
Julius's legs tense, ready for action.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.180
On the other side of the door, you hear a small voice.

23:13.180 --> 23:16.060
Hello, this is a nice newsman.

23:16.060 --> 23:16.900
Hello.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.380
Is your daddy here?

23:18.380 --> 23:19.220
No.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.280
Perfect, open up.

23:22.420 --> 23:25.220
Cal like winces, but doesn't correct him.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.060
Doesn't like.

23:26.100 --> 23:26.940
Roll persuade.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.300
30 pass on a 60.

23:31.300 --> 23:33.980
This little girl succeeded as well

23:33.980 --> 23:36.300
with a higher roll, the 47.

23:36.300 --> 23:40.180
She says, I'm not supposed to let in any strangers.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.860
Oh, of course not.

23:41.860 --> 23:43.860
But I'm no stranger.

23:43.860 --> 23:46.780
I'm Cal Colorado from the news.

23:46.780 --> 23:48.100
You've probably seen me.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.100
Oh man, this candy bar is super good.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.740
I wish I had somebody to share it with.

23:51.740 --> 23:52.580
Oh my God.

23:52.580 --> 23:57.580
You sound like you've done this before.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.740
You're gonna have to learn the enemy, you know?

24:02.740 --> 24:04.820
Any horrible thoughts from Becker now?

24:06.660 --> 24:07.820
No, he's just filming.

24:14.260 --> 24:16.040
Such as horrible deeds.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.180
Cal, if you wanna go ahead and roll.

24:20.180 --> 24:21.620
Yeah, I'll roll.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.180
That's a 67 on an 80.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.840
Yeah, she passed as well, but only with a 30.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.500
Cal Colorado from a TV?

24:28.500 --> 24:30.740
That's right, I'm from your TV, sweetie.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.580
Wow.

24:32.580 --> 24:36.420
And the door unlocks and then the door slowly opens

24:36.420 --> 24:40.860
and you see just the most adorable little six year old

24:40.860 --> 24:43.060
on the other side staring up at you.

24:43.060 --> 24:44.500
Cal turns back to you guys

24:44.500 --> 24:47.220
and like gives you a very like pained look

24:47.220 --> 24:49.860
and then turns back to her with a huge smile

24:49.860 --> 24:52.940
and he's like, hi, I'm so glad to see you.

24:52.940 --> 24:54.300
I've always wanted to meet you.

24:54.300 --> 24:58.220
Wow, it's Mr. Cal Colorado who's on my TV

24:58.220 --> 25:00.060
in front of me at the door.

25:00.060 --> 25:01.780
Come in and look at my toys.

25:01.780 --> 25:05.220
I would love to see your toys, but first I need to know.

25:05.220 --> 25:09.140
This one's a pony and her name is Sandal.

25:09.140 --> 25:12.100
Sandal, I like Sandal very much.

25:12.100 --> 25:12.940
Me too.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.260
What's this one called?

25:14.260 --> 25:16.060
Oh, this one's Tressa.

25:16.060 --> 25:17.500
Tressa, does Tressa know

25:17.500 --> 25:19.580
where your daddy keeps his work things?

25:20.260 --> 25:23.180
She like makes the horse nay.

25:25.020 --> 25:29.740
The work things, I only know about where those are

25:29.740 --> 25:32.500
if you can feed me.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.420
Oh, it seems that Tressa is hungry.

25:35.420 --> 25:37.380
Pass the candy bar over Julius.

25:37.380 --> 25:38.860
Julius was lying.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.420
You've got a six year old holding up a little

25:44.420 --> 25:46.260
like miniature horse at you.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.380
Julius feed the horse.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.300
Beck, check your pockets.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.780
Beck definitely has candy bars in his pockets.

25:52.140 --> 25:53.100
He pulls one out.

25:53.940 --> 25:57.540
Here's one for, was it Sandal or Tressa

25:57.540 --> 25:58.380
that was so hungry?

25:58.380 --> 26:00.380
Tressa, Tressa.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.060
Here you go Tressa.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.380
And I kind of am shoving the candy bar

26:04.380 --> 26:05.820
against the horse's mouth.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.940
Oh, it looks like she likes that.

26:07.940 --> 26:09.340
It's an oat candy bar.

26:09.340 --> 26:11.740
Someone roll like 50, 50 up and down.

26:14.180 --> 26:16.260
Who's leaving a six year old home alone?

26:17.260 --> 26:18.460
45.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.740
That's good.

26:19.740 --> 26:20.580
That's good.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.700
These neglectful parents.

26:21.700 --> 26:24.780
You think that you hear a sound coming from

26:24.780 --> 26:27.220
like the bathroom or something, but.

26:27.220 --> 26:28.300
Then a cat hops out.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.140
Nice.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.740
Oh, Tressa's so hungry.

26:35.540 --> 26:37.140
Julius, while this is happening,

26:37.140 --> 26:39.380
is gonna do a quick once over of the.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.500
Yeah, everybody, yeah.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.340
Yeah.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.340
Actually nods off.

26:42.340 --> 26:43.180
Roll search.

26:44.020 --> 26:47.380
31 on a 70.

26:47.380 --> 26:49.380
Okay, hit me with what you're looking for.

26:49.380 --> 26:50.620
Our footage, you son of a bitch.

26:50.620 --> 26:54.020
Yeah, any sort of tech looking stuff

26:54.020 --> 26:57.660
or anything that would, or like a safe or something.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.780
Yeah, Cal passes too.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.380
He's like, and tell me this one's name.

27:00.380 --> 27:02.420
But he's like looking behind her shoulder

27:02.420 --> 27:03.900
like all over the room.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.180
This one's Dango.

27:05.180 --> 27:06.020
Dango.

27:06.020 --> 27:06.860
Dango.

27:06.860 --> 27:08.380
How'd you come up with that name?

27:08.380 --> 27:09.220
I said it.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.020
What a ham.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.100
You would do very well on the news, young lady.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.820
She immediately runs away

27:18.820 --> 27:21.220
and is digging through toys.

27:21.220 --> 27:23.700
Hey, remember Tressa was gonna show us

27:23.700 --> 27:25.860
where your daddy keeps his work banks?

27:25.860 --> 27:28.580
This one's a ham pulls out a pig.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.540
Oh, oh, smashing.

27:30.540 --> 27:31.980
That's what you do with a pig bank.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.460
Did Julius find anything?

27:33.460 --> 27:36.500
Yes, you found a safe.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.700
Big, small.

27:37.700 --> 27:41.780
Yes, it is a medium sized safe.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.260
It's a Goldilocks safe.

27:43.260 --> 27:48.260
It is in the back bedroom is the master bedroom closet.

27:49.020 --> 27:51.780
There is a average size safe back there.

27:51.780 --> 27:54.260
Julius is gonna try 88, five.

27:55.580 --> 27:56.820
It does not work.

27:56.820 --> 27:59.780
Julius, what if you tried eight, three, six?

27:59.780 --> 28:01.220
He tries eight, three, six.

28:01.220 --> 28:03.180
Go ahead and roll luck.

28:03.180 --> 28:04.980
If you create, I'll give it to you.

28:06.460 --> 28:07.820
Oh my God though.

28:07.820 --> 28:08.980
It was a 23.

28:08.980 --> 28:09.820
Yeah.

28:10.820 --> 28:12.860
Like the number movie.

28:12.860 --> 28:14.100
Like the number movie.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.220
Does Julius start seeing numbers?

28:16.220 --> 28:18.060
Wait, yeah, actually.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.100
Just like the time I crashed my Scion TC.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.500
Why are you trying eight, three, six?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.660
There's just like a subliminal vibe in here.

28:25.660 --> 28:26.500
Yeah.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.340
Like it just kind of feels like.

28:27.340 --> 28:28.180
God told them to.

28:28.180 --> 28:29.100
Because it's the apartment number.

28:29.100 --> 28:29.920
That's a good reason.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.760
That's fine.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.500
But it was boobs was the apartment number, right?

28:34.300 --> 28:36.540
Oh, right, right, try boobs.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.780
I did already, it didn't work.

28:38.780 --> 28:42.500
You also see a spot on the desk where there was a laptop,

28:42.500 --> 28:45.500
but there is currently not a laptop

28:45.500 --> 28:49.460
and it seems like the charger is pulled up in that spot

28:49.460 --> 28:51.100
and there's like a clip for it

28:51.100 --> 28:52.700
and the mouse and mouse pad are there,

28:52.700 --> 28:55.940
but there's no laptop sitting in the empty spot on the desk.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.460
What was the kid's name?

28:57.460 --> 28:58.300
What?

28:58.300 --> 28:59.120
You know what?

28:59.120 --> 29:00.460
You've told us your horsey's names.

29:00.460 --> 29:01.300
Yeah.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.120
And the pig's name.

29:02.120 --> 29:02.960
What is your name?

29:02.960 --> 29:03.800
Oh, my name?

29:03.800 --> 29:05.580
Way-chill.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.160
Well, Way-chill.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.420
No, it's Way-chill.

29:08.940 --> 29:09.780
Oh, Rachel.

29:09.780 --> 29:10.620
That's right.

29:10.620 --> 29:11.440
I have a cousin named Rachel.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.540
She's smart like you.

29:12.540 --> 29:13.380
She smiles.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.900
Do you get left alone here very often?

29:16.900 --> 29:17.720
No.

29:17.720 --> 29:18.560
No?

29:18.560 --> 29:20.460
How long ago did your parents step out?

29:20.460 --> 29:22.260
She's just like playing with toys

29:22.260 --> 29:26.140
and she's like, mom went down to go get some groceries

29:26.140 --> 29:29.340
to finish up the meal and you look over

29:29.340 --> 29:31.540
and there's like some things have been pulled out

29:31.540 --> 29:34.900
of the fridge and like no chopping has started,

29:34.900 --> 29:37.820
but it seems like meal prep is about to begin.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.380
Oh, I bet that looks like a good lunch.

29:40.380 --> 29:43.180
I think you probably have a good mom

29:43.180 --> 29:45.540
who feeds you good nutritious food.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.400
I'm sure your dad cares about that too.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.620
What time would you say he left for work?

29:49.620 --> 29:52.900
Oh, I don't see my daddy very much.

29:52.900 --> 29:53.740
Oh.

29:53.740 --> 29:55.060
Julius pops his head out.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.500
Had a dad like that too.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.740
Oh, yeah.

29:57.740 --> 30:00.140
Remind me again when your birthday is.

30:00.140 --> 30:01.700
Oh, my birthday?

30:01.700 --> 30:02.540
Uh-huh.

30:02.540 --> 30:03.660
August 3rd?

30:03.660 --> 30:04.780
Of what year?

30:04.780 --> 30:05.600
What?

30:05.600 --> 30:06.440
How old are you?

30:06.440 --> 30:07.460
The year you were born.

30:07.980 --> 30:08.820
I'm this many.

30:08.820 --> 30:09.780
Six, Julius.

30:09.780 --> 30:13.940
Julius deducts six from the year that it is currently.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.060
It's 2022.

30:15.060 --> 30:18.220
He tries, yeah, I'm not doing that math.

30:18.220 --> 30:22.220
It's like 1980, what am I, Stephen Hawking?

30:23.180 --> 30:28.180
Julius tries eight, three, you said six years old?

30:28.220 --> 30:30.700
We already did eight, three, six, we already.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.620
Well, not, yeah, but.

30:32.620 --> 30:34.460
This time I did it because August 3rd

30:34.460 --> 30:35.900
and she's six years old.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.340
Yeah, eight.

30:37.340 --> 30:41.860
Well, not eight, three, six, but eight, three, six.

30:41.860 --> 30:42.700
16.

30:42.700 --> 30:43.520
Eight, three, 16.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.360
Roll luck again.

30:45.620 --> 30:46.900
90 is good, right?

30:48.900 --> 30:50.020
I liked them.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.700
Julius is gonna kick the safe.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.540
What was that?

30:52.540 --> 30:53.360
Ow.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.540
Oh, that's my friend Julius.

30:54.540 --> 30:55.580
He's very clumsy.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.140
Are any of these animals clumsy?

30:57.140 --> 30:58.260
Oh, yeah.

30:59.500 --> 31:00.320
Twain?

31:00.320 --> 31:01.160
Twain.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.220
Twain is very clumsy.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.560
Yeah, Twain is always twipping.

31:06.420 --> 31:09.060
It's okay to be clumsy sometimes.

31:09.060 --> 31:09.900
Yeah.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.380
Beck is leaning over to Cal.

31:11.380 --> 31:14.440
Do you think that means that the name is Twain or Train?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.820
I have no fucking idea.

31:15.820 --> 31:17.900
Julius tries nine, one, one.

31:21.940 --> 31:24.140
As you're going through the safe

31:24.140 --> 31:26.020
and just like trying repeatedly

31:26.020 --> 31:28.020
to open it with different random numbers,

31:28.020 --> 31:29.740
you're not having a lot of luck.

31:29.740 --> 31:32.060
But while this conversation is happening

31:32.060 --> 31:34.420
with the child in the main room

31:34.420 --> 31:36.420
and you're going through all this stuff

31:36.420 --> 31:38.780
by the desk in this back room,

31:38.780 --> 31:43.780
you see that underneath some folders

31:43.780 --> 31:46.540
and there's some mail

31:46.540 --> 31:50.220
and there's a handwritten piece of paper

31:50.220 --> 31:52.180
shoved up in the middle of it.

31:52.180 --> 31:55.740
And it says, I always keep the safe unlocked.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.860
Julius, Julius, just try opening it.

32:01.860 --> 32:03.540
It says it's always kept unlocked.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.420
It's a safe.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.540
It's meant to be hard to get into.

32:06.540 --> 32:07.860
You can't just pass a search check

32:07.860 --> 32:08.980
and get into a safe.

32:08.980 --> 32:10.780
What does your paper say?

32:10.780 --> 32:11.660
The paper.

32:11.660 --> 32:14.500
It just says all that explaining that about safes.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.340
It says.

32:15.340 --> 32:16.160
That's safes.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.000
As a role-playing mechanic.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.180
As a reminder, safes.

32:18.180 --> 32:19.020
Oh yeah.

32:19.020 --> 32:19.860
Locking.

32:19.860 --> 32:20.680
It should be difficult.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.820
It should feel challenging but rewarding.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.420
Over your players to open one.

32:27.460 --> 32:32.460
It says S.G.Naturhole.

32:33.860 --> 32:38.460
N-A-T-U-R capital H-O-L-E.

32:38.460 --> 32:41.060
The Naturhole, which you all know

32:41.060 --> 32:45.580
is an abandoned baseball stadium in the city.

32:45.580 --> 32:49.860
It was abandoned because there was a sinkhole.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.380
I forgot about this.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.780
In the middle of the infield

32:54.780 --> 32:58.700
that basically eliminated the entire playing area

32:58.700 --> 32:59.700
within the stadium.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.900
However, the stadium seating itself.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.460
Well, plus the triple A team,

33:03.460 --> 33:04.740
the contingent corndogs.

33:04.740 --> 33:05.580
That's right.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.420
Wait, no, they can't play there.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.260
They were.

33:08.260 --> 33:09.820
It's a movie theater now.

33:09.820 --> 33:10.880
Exactly.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.020
And it's a movie theater that we called.

33:14.020 --> 33:14.860
The Naturhole.

33:14.860 --> 33:15.680
The Naturhole.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.060
Shout out to Thomas Cox, not a patron.

33:18.060 --> 33:22.540
Just on our, in our session.

33:22.540 --> 33:23.860
Just a friend of the podcast.

33:23.860 --> 33:28.860
In our session zero that is yet to be released.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.380
Our session zero part two for season two.

33:31.820 --> 33:33.020
Unofficial collaborator.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.980
We created the abandoned baseball park.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.120
The Naturhole.

33:39.120 --> 33:39.960
The Naturhole.

33:39.960 --> 33:40.860
The Naturhole.

33:40.860 --> 33:42.540
Currently the movie theater.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.580
Specifically for large events.

33:45.580 --> 33:46.420
The Naturhole.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.620
Wasn't it like also three,

33:48.620 --> 33:51.520
like all the walls were the screen?

33:51.520 --> 33:52.360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.100
It's like an omni-plex or whatever

33:54.100 --> 33:57.120
where you like look down into this massive screen

33:57.120 --> 33:58.220
and you like, yeah.

33:58.220 --> 34:00.720
It sounds like a suboptimal viewing experience.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.100
They're still figuring it out.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.980
I bet that's cool for five minutes.

34:06.980 --> 34:11.100
And then there underneath where it says SG Naturhole,

34:11.100 --> 34:13.340
it has cross streets,

34:13.340 --> 34:17.020
which are on like the Northeast side of the Naturhole.

34:17.020 --> 34:20.300
And it says, follow down.

34:20.300 --> 34:22.100
Julius grabs that piece of paper.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.140
He's just looking at it.

34:23.140 --> 34:26.620
He grabs it and goes out into the main area with them.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.460
Guys, I think I've found a clue.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.540
And he looks over at the like meal prep area.

34:32.540 --> 34:35.220
I think we should get out of here and go to that meeting.

34:35.220 --> 34:36.640
Beck agrees, Beck.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.860
As soon as he heard her say

34:37.860 --> 34:39.720
that she was just popping out for groceries,

34:39.720 --> 34:42.580
he felt like we're on a time crunch.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.800
Oh yeah, yeah.

34:43.800 --> 34:44.860
If you feel like we were good here,

34:44.860 --> 34:47.020
I think we should probably make ourselves scarce.

34:47.020 --> 34:47.900
You look over at Beck

34:47.900 --> 34:49.660
and he's like sitting crisscross applesauce

34:49.660 --> 34:51.020
and having his nails painted.

34:51.020 --> 34:55.140
And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.

34:55.140 --> 34:57.800
You mean Cal, your own character?

34:58.080 --> 34:58.920
I don't fucking know.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.640
I thought you were saying I was doing that.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.960
That would work too.

35:02.880 --> 35:03.960
Oh, Beck.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.600
Well, she did want to do yours next, but that's okay.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.920
I can do them later.

35:07.920 --> 35:08.760
Let's.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.360
Are you leaving?

35:16.360 --> 35:17.440
I'm so sorry.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.880
It was so nice to meet you and all your friends.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.320
But anytime, if you feel like you miss us,

35:22.320 --> 35:24.440
you can just tune in to the local news

35:24.440 --> 35:25.400
and you'll see me again.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.560
This is Cal, Colorado saying it was nice to meet you.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.400
Oh, yeah.

35:30.960 --> 35:31.800
Give a little high five.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.640
Oh, a little high five.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.300
Boop, boop.

35:34.300 --> 35:38.600
Julius is gonna see if he can lift up this safe.

35:38.600 --> 35:43.600
As you go to lift up the safe with those thick thighs,

35:43.920 --> 35:45.960
give me a strength.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.840
You can't pick up a fucking safe.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.200
Five on a 50.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.880
But as you lift it up off the ground,

35:55.320 --> 35:58.040
you see that there's no bottom on it.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.720
Like you're just lifting the top up off.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.820
It's like not connected to its base.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.880
And is there anything on the ground?

36:05.880 --> 36:08.360
Yeah, yeah, there's stacks and stacks of cash.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.500
He's gonna take some, not all.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.720
When you're walking out into the living room,

36:15.720 --> 36:18.080
do you have the cash on you or have you already?

36:18.080 --> 36:20.740
I have it, well, there's that little girl.

36:20.740 --> 36:22.840
Yep, Julius has it in his hands and is like,

36:22.960 --> 36:24.760
guys, he stole from us.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.480
Wow, is that all money?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.600
Monopoly money.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.280
I'm not allowed to play that game yet.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.280
Yes, it's a cutthroat game,

36:32.280 --> 36:34.400
far too cruel for one of your age.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.620
That's what my mom says.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.460
Where did you get that?

36:36.460 --> 36:37.640
Where did you get that, Julius?

36:37.640 --> 36:39.480
The safe is bad.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.640
The safe was no good.

36:40.640 --> 36:41.920
The safe is bad.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.760
No bottom.

36:42.760 --> 36:44.520
I don't even begin to know what you mean.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.920
He just kept points in the room,

36:45.920 --> 36:47.760
he's like, go check it out.

36:47.760 --> 36:48.600
I think you're pointing at me

36:48.600 --> 36:50.080
like I don't know what he fucking said.

36:50.080 --> 36:55.080
I don't know what it means either.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.520
Yeah, Cal, I mean, Cal walks in there like dumbfounded

36:58.520 --> 36:59.640
and sees all the money.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.480
Beck follows.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.840
Yeah, there's probably 35, 40 Gs in here.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.440
But is that all there is?

37:04.440 --> 37:06.260
Oh no, there's a bunch of papers and stuff too.

37:06.260 --> 37:07.680
Julius, put that back

37:07.680 --> 37:09.980
and start filming one of your TikToks.

37:09.980 --> 37:10.820
He does.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.960
Does Cal want to be in it or?

37:13.960 --> 37:15.640
Cal just stands in front of the safe

37:15.640 --> 37:17.000
and says, do a boomerang.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Can you still do boomerang?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.360
Julius.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.680
And he starts dabbing.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.720
Julius puts down the phone and is like,

37:22.720 --> 37:26.080
maybe we shouldn't document this.

37:26.080 --> 37:26.920
No, no, no.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.320
Okay, well, get pictures.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.240
Beck, you're filming, right?

37:29.240 --> 37:30.080
Oh yes.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.180
We need to document that this man

37:31.180 --> 37:32.740
has been paid off by the goddess.

37:32.740 --> 37:35.840
Is the paperwork or anything in there

37:35.840 --> 37:37.920
give any indication where the money came from?

37:37.920 --> 37:39.520
I would like to flip through it as I'm filming.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.680
Yeah, what else is going?

37:40.680 --> 37:43.240
I'm getting scans basically of the documents.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.340
Oh yeah, that's great.

37:44.340 --> 37:46.560
That's what you need to do.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.160
Roll accounting, everyone who's checking this out.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.400
Wow, I have accounting.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.380
Could I roll bureaucracy?

37:54.380 --> 37:55.600
No, I'm going to go with accounting.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.800
I got a crit success, a 33 on a 50.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.840
Okay, that's awesome.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.400
These figures are all a little bit over my head.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.600
Does anybody know what these mean?

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
Oh, Julius.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.440
Let me take a look.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.880
You know what this means.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.980
Wilson Wiley seems to be on the payroll

38:12.980 --> 38:15.600
for some sort of a nonprofit.

38:15.600 --> 38:19.240
And as you follow the trail of money

38:19.240 --> 38:22.840
through all of these stacks of papers and papers

38:22.840 --> 38:25.400
with your keen accounting skills

38:25.400 --> 38:28.400
and that critical success, you flip through

38:28.400 --> 38:31.800
and you can draw a direct line from the Godel company

38:31.800 --> 38:35.240
to a shell, to a shell, to a shell, to a shell,

38:35.240 --> 38:36.380
to this nonprofit.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.720
The nonprofit's called Where's The Money?

38:38.720 --> 38:40.400
I don't know, not here.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.640
W-A-R.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.760
W-A-R-E.

38:44.020 --> 38:44.860
Duh.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.260
Duh.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.200
Holy shit.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.580
There's something big here.

38:49.580 --> 38:51.260
What is it in a few short words?

38:51.260 --> 38:54.400
He's on the Godel's payroll, 100%.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.240
How do you know?

38:55.240 --> 38:56.060
It's all in here.

38:56.060 --> 38:59.660
And Julius holds up all the paperwork and documents,

38:59.660 --> 39:01.780
pockets it, leaves the money.

39:01.780 --> 39:02.920
He's like, we should go.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.220
This just became very dangerous.

39:05.220 --> 39:07.200
I don't know if we need to take anything with us

39:07.200 --> 39:08.980
because I've got it all on camera.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.300
Alertness checks, please.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.060
Crit fail.

39:15.260 --> 39:19.340
I pass a two on a 40.

39:19.340 --> 39:21.120
Tell me if I got these out to hand to you also.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.060
I fail, a 62 on a 40.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.460
Sorry, I keep meaning to get up and get my own.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.980
Beck, you're the only one who hears the ding.

39:27.980 --> 39:28.820
Of the elevator?

39:28.820 --> 39:29.640
Of the elevator.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.020
What ding?

39:34.020 --> 39:35.520
The egg timer on the counter.

39:37.980 --> 39:38.820
Egg.

39:38.820 --> 39:43.820
I get big eyes and I, Carol, Julius, that was the elevator.

39:44.180 --> 39:47.020
I think we really need to get out of here and quick.

39:47.020 --> 39:47.860
Oh, fuck.

39:47.860 --> 39:48.780
Let's hoof it, boys.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.820
Julius is gonna keep, he's gonna keep the papers,

39:51.820 --> 39:54.340
leave everything else and hoof it.

39:54.340 --> 39:55.560
Thank you so much for your time.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.740
I would love to have the tea party

39:56.740 --> 39:59.100
with you and Tereza and Rachel sometime.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.060
Absolutely, okay.

40:00.060 --> 40:00.900
Bye, Conquerel.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.460
Goodbye, and remember what I said about the TV

40:02.460 --> 40:03.800
and good luck.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.780
She holds out her arms for a hug.

40:05.780 --> 40:07.660
If you give her the hug, you're gonna get caught in the room.

40:07.660 --> 40:12.540
No, no, I give her a high five in each open hand

40:12.540 --> 40:14.180
and a thumbs up and a wink is like,

40:14.180 --> 40:16.220
I'm running backwards out the front door.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.800
Julius says, don't tell anyone we were here.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.700
Nobody will believe you.

40:20.700 --> 40:21.700
The three of you like.

40:21.700 --> 40:22.540
Shh.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.140
The three of you slam into the wall,

40:33.140 --> 40:36.340
like the hall wall on the other side away from this door

40:36.340 --> 40:39.860
as the door slams shut and you turn

40:39.860 --> 40:41.260
and looking down the hall,

40:41.260 --> 40:44.180
you see a woman in her mid thirties

40:44.180 --> 40:47.460
carrying like four bags of groceries,

40:47.460 --> 40:52.460
tote bags walking toward you with suspicious eyes

40:52.620 --> 40:56.380
and I need whoever has the highest bureaucracy.

40:56.380 --> 40:57.220
I got a 50.

40:57.220 --> 40:58.060
I got a 70.

40:58.060 --> 40:58.880
I got a 50.

40:59.940 --> 41:01.580
To roll.

41:01.580 --> 41:02.400
35.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.460
Hello, excuse me.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.300
Hello, yes.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.120
Is everything okay?

41:05.120 --> 41:09.100
Yes, yes, we were looking for apartment 936.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.980
Oh, one floor up.

41:11.580 --> 41:12.540
This is the eighth floor.

41:12.540 --> 41:13.380
Oh.

41:13.380 --> 41:15.620
I told you, I thought we might have hit that.

41:15.620 --> 41:16.460
Idiot.

41:16.460 --> 41:18.180
He always does this.

41:18.180 --> 41:19.700
He's quite stupid, ma'am.

41:19.700 --> 41:21.100
Anyway, have a nice day.

41:21.100 --> 41:23.740
She's smiling, not really paying attention.

41:23.740 --> 41:26.220
She puts her key in the door and goes in.

41:26.220 --> 41:28.500
And yeah, I'm like waving nervously

41:28.500 --> 41:30.700
and frantically pressing the elevator button.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.340
It's not coming.

41:35.340 --> 41:37.300
No, it's right there because she just came up on it

41:37.300 --> 41:39.180
and you hop into the elevator.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.620
You going up to the ninth?

41:41.420 --> 41:43.740
Yeah, I press one and as the door is closed,

41:43.740 --> 41:45.260
I make a show of like being like,

41:45.260 --> 41:46.940
you pressed one, not nine.

41:46.940 --> 41:49.260
We'll have to do it all over again.

41:49.260 --> 41:50.600
Silly man.

41:50.600 --> 41:51.780
She's like already in her apartment.

41:51.780 --> 41:52.620
Yeah, she's gone.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.260
Deep cover.

41:57.260 --> 41:58.740
How was your friend?

41:58.740 --> 42:00.700
They were not at home, unfortunately.

42:01.780 --> 42:04.220
We just sat outside their apartment knocking

42:04.220 --> 42:06.180
for roughly 15 minutes.

42:06.180 --> 42:07.020
What a shame.

42:07.020 --> 42:07.840
Who was it again?

42:07.840 --> 42:10.500
Oh, we call them Gramps.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.580
We call them Gramps.

42:12.580 --> 42:13.420
Oh, oh, Gramps.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.140
They'll always just be Gramps to us.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.420
You have a good one, sir.

42:16.420 --> 42:17.260
Yeah.

42:17.260 --> 42:18.100
We've got places to be.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.200
Same to you.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.960
Grabbing a little persuade on the way out.

42:21.960 --> 42:22.800
Do I get in on that?

42:22.800 --> 42:24.500
Yeah, 58 on an 80.

42:26.060 --> 42:29.440
39 on a 50, yeah, 50.

42:29.440 --> 42:30.280
You both rolled higher.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.120
I didn't talk.

42:32.260 --> 42:34.900
You both rolled higher and therefore he's just like,

42:34.900 --> 42:39.640
huh, oh, I guess maybe Desmond is Gramps.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.960
And then he's back to thinking about

42:40.960 --> 42:42.460
whatever he's thinking about before.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.200
Just how many times he can jerk off in a day.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.960
Without thinking it's weird.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.440
Without thinking it's weird.

42:53.280 --> 42:56.040
I'm gonna go pee again for the millionth time.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.280
I wanna get on record real quick.

42:58.280 --> 43:01.440
Is anybody else curious why that was a bureaucracy role

43:01.440 --> 43:03.840
to walk past her or was that a mistake?

43:03.840 --> 43:06.540
I think he made it up or maybe he didn't.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.560
Yeah, I never really know.

43:10.360 --> 43:13.560
Sometimes I think we put not enough faith in Zach

43:13.560 --> 43:17.140
and sometimes I think we put far too much.

43:17.140 --> 43:19.120
Yeah, that's why I'm just like, I don't know.

43:19.120 --> 43:19.960
I don't know.

43:19.960 --> 43:20.800
I don't know either.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.620
I don't know.

43:21.620 --> 43:22.460
Go pee, okay.

43:22.460 --> 43:23.800
What was the last thing we said?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.580
Wait, one, two, three, nose goes, nose goes.

43:25.580 --> 43:26.420
I think that was me.

43:26.420 --> 43:27.260
It was.

43:27.260 --> 43:30.120
And we're back and you guys have just headed down

43:30.120 --> 43:31.640
into the parking garage here,

43:31.640 --> 43:34.720
hopping in that Mercedes C-Class and heading out,

43:34.720 --> 43:36.840
saying goodbye to the nice gentleman

43:36.840 --> 43:38.400
who's waiting at the elevator,

43:38.440 --> 43:40.040
thinking about J and O.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.040
My Dave!

43:41.040 --> 43:42.920
How we looking on time?

43:42.920 --> 43:44.960
Oh, time?

43:44.960 --> 43:46.240
It is time.

43:46.240 --> 43:48.780
You see a text on your phone right now.

43:48.780 --> 43:49.740
What's it say?

43:49.740 --> 43:52.280
And it just says ETA question mark

43:52.280 --> 43:55.740
because it is time for you to be at the can station.

43:55.740 --> 43:57.960
Tell him we're caught in construction on the freeway.

43:57.960 --> 43:59.520
It's gonna be a little while,

43:59.520 --> 44:01.640
but we're bringing him the story of a lifetime

44:01.640 --> 44:04.600
and we're going to fucking Richard Riley's house.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.720
I text type traffic

44:06.760 --> 44:08.880
and then we head to Richard Riley's house.

44:08.880 --> 44:12.280
Oh, shit.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.400
We could also like make it like a Zoom call

44:15.400 --> 44:16.620
and just do it from here.

44:16.620 --> 44:18.340
Maybe we can find that idea.

44:18.340 --> 44:20.680
We need the footage first, but yes, that could work.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.680
After I send traffic, I say FaceTime question mark.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.760
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.720
Okay, guys, it's time for...

44:31.240 --> 44:34.740
Hey, what's up my fucking nephew?

44:34.740 --> 44:36.360
How you living?

44:37.360 --> 44:40.360
Oh, it's good to be me and it's good to be you,

44:40.360 --> 44:42.740
but you are not here.

44:42.740 --> 44:43.920
And you said you were gonna be here.

44:43.920 --> 44:45.720
What the fuck is up?

44:45.720 --> 44:48.280
Not base bro, not base bro.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.320
Forget about it.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.720
Yeah, I mean, it's a good thing that we got

44:52.720 --> 44:54.640
Cloud Atlas in Cal's car

44:54.640 --> 44:57.040
because the traffic is just crazy.

44:57.040 --> 45:02.040
A phenomenal film takes me back to my Lake Tahoe days.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.480
From the womb to the tomb, right?

45:04.520 --> 45:08.320
Yes, sir, and I am hungry to see you.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.280
Where is Cal?

45:10.280 --> 45:11.120
Where's Beck?

45:11.120 --> 45:11.940
Where are you?

45:11.940 --> 45:14.280
I kind of show the car,

45:14.280 --> 45:17.340
trying not to like let him see that the traffic

45:17.340 --> 45:19.980
may not be as bad as we said,

45:19.980 --> 45:21.140
but I show like Cal and Beck.

45:21.140 --> 45:24.400
I'm like, they're in the car here with me.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.240
Say hi, guys.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.040
Beck gives a wave as the camera pans.

45:28.040 --> 45:30.880
Yeah, Cal gives a little salute and says,

45:30.880 --> 45:32.520
great to see you, Typh.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.000
Hey, we're working on the story of a lifetime here.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.440
I think you're gonna like what your nephew serves up to you.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.280
Obviously, traffic's a little behind

45:39.280 --> 45:43.080
and we're always pursuing any possible lead.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.200
I'm sitting here driving

45:44.200 --> 45:48.120
and I'm telling Beck what to film for some good B-roll

45:48.120 --> 45:51.120
and also he's Googling different sources

45:51.120 --> 45:52.320
and calling them and things.

45:52.320 --> 45:56.080
I'm not worried about whether you're working or not.

45:56.080 --> 45:59.120
I just gotta have the three of you come in right now.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.920
Well, as soon as traffic permits, we'll be there,

46:02.440 --> 46:05.400
but we're really, oh, Cal honks on his horn.

46:05.400 --> 46:08.720
He's like, beep, beep, beep, you dummy.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.600
Yeah, it's just real nuts out here.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.040
Lots of wrecks, lots of construction.

46:14.040 --> 46:16.680
Oh, wow, I think I just saw another one.

46:16.680 --> 46:17.520
Oh.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.340
Another one.

46:18.340 --> 46:22.300
Ah, like I said, well, I'm hungry for you to come on back,

46:22.300 --> 46:23.840
so get on back here.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.520
Yeah, yeah, are you actually hungry?

46:25.520 --> 46:27.480
We could stop and get some food for you.

46:27.480 --> 46:28.320
No, no, absolutely.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.160
We'll go ahead and do that.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.160
We'll add that to the list.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.360
Do not stop.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.800
Oh, wow, horrible reception.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.180
Cal's just doing that.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.640
And I'm like, uh, oh, eh, uh.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.240
And like Julius is like freezing his face

46:48.240 --> 46:49.800
and like making that sound and then.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.240
He can see like the traffic behind you moving smoothly.

46:53.240 --> 46:54.080
Like.

46:58.860 --> 47:01.240
Oh, that was strange.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.280
We'll be in by the end of the day.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.480
All right, end of the day.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.440
I mean, I need you here right away,

47:06.440 --> 47:08.400
straight here right now, okay?

47:08.400 --> 47:11.440
Otherwise it's back to Barstow for you, Julius.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.820
Cause I ain't going back to Barstow, that's all you.

47:14.820 --> 47:16.520
I thought you said Barstool.

47:16.520 --> 47:18.320
Ah, no, I didn't.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.720
I don't want to work for that guy.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.840
No, ew, ew.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.800
Who would ever want to work for a guy like that

47:23.800 --> 47:25.880
when you go work for me, bro?

47:25.880 --> 47:28.560
Julius kind of looks at Cal and Beck like.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.680
I've heard him say many times at the Foundry

47:31.040 --> 47:33.240
that his dream job is to work for Barstool.

47:36.240 --> 47:37.960
We'll be in ASAP.

47:37.960 --> 47:39.800
I don't know your dream job, Julius.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.800
You'll have to tell me after this call.

47:41.800 --> 47:42.640
He hangs up.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.280
He says like bye, but that he kind of hangs up.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.720
Julius would love to work for Barstool Sports.

47:50.920 --> 47:53.040
Hello, this is Julius Summers.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.760
Welcome back to Call Me Daddy.

47:54.760 --> 47:57.800
These thighs were made for Barstool.

48:00.680 --> 48:05.680
What is that guy's name?

48:06.140 --> 48:07.320
Dave something?

48:07.320 --> 48:08.160
Portnoy.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.000
I was going to say it's Portnoy.

48:09.000 --> 48:09.840
Port something.

48:09.840 --> 48:10.680
Portnoy, yeah.

48:10.680 --> 48:11.520
Dave Cooley.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.480
The drummer for, all right, let's go.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.600
Oh, Will Ferrell.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.160
The drummer for Will Ferrell.

48:18.360 --> 48:21.300
Okay, I'm going to try to watch some more Cloud Atlas

48:21.300 --> 48:23.560
before we get to Richard's house.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.760
I mean, couldn't you be doing something more productive

48:26.760 --> 48:28.160
like editing a TikTok?

48:28.160 --> 48:29.260
We are at work.

48:29.260 --> 48:33.740
I mean, I don't think Julius has any TikToks to edit.

48:33.740 --> 48:36.820
He's going to post, he'll post a Grover's Gorge TikTok.

48:36.820 --> 48:37.860
Nice.

48:37.860 --> 48:38.700
A good one.

48:38.700 --> 48:39.980
A little teaser.

48:39.980 --> 48:40.860
Another little tease.

48:40.860 --> 48:42.340
Another little tease.

48:42.340 --> 48:43.260
Yes, we can.

48:43.260 --> 48:48.260
When you go on, you see that the previous two TikToks

48:49.100 --> 48:52.200
that you've uploaded with Grover's Gorge footage

48:52.200 --> 48:53.300
have been deleted.

48:53.300 --> 48:56.420
Julius immediately goes to the settings

48:56.420 --> 48:58.420
and changes the password for the TikTok.

48:58.460 --> 49:00.980
Okay, I'm going to have you roll

49:00.980 --> 49:04.980
because it might send an email

49:04.980 --> 49:07.140
that you have to change the password to,

49:07.140 --> 49:09.100
but it might two-factor you.

49:09.100 --> 49:11.700
Well, you could see what email it would be sending to.

49:11.700 --> 49:14.700
Let's just get a luck roll since we're playing a dice game.

49:14.700 --> 49:16.180
I want under 50.

49:16.180 --> 49:17.020
No, actually.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.420
88.

49:20.420 --> 49:22.260
Oh, no.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.980
Oh, boy.

49:23.980 --> 49:25.180
That's the worst one.

49:29.100 --> 49:31.140
You're locked out.

49:31.140 --> 49:32.420
You're not sure what happened,

49:32.420 --> 49:35.260
but when you go to TikTok on your browser,

49:35.260 --> 49:37.980
that most recent TikTok, also not there,

49:37.980 --> 49:41.020
and a new text from Tyf, come in now.

49:41.020 --> 49:42.540
Oh, shit.

49:42.540 --> 49:45.580
Julius does not share that information and-

49:45.580 --> 49:46.420
Oh, shit!

49:49.620 --> 49:53.300
Julius thinks if they go talk to Tyf,

49:53.300 --> 49:55.780
they're not going to, this story's done.

49:55.820 --> 49:58.780
So he wants to get done what he can now.

49:58.780 --> 50:00.500
How's that TikTok coming, buddy?

50:00.500 --> 50:01.500
I'm working on it.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.420
Forgot the password.

50:02.420 --> 50:04.580
If you just hit forgot password,

50:04.580 --> 50:06.380
I think it'll send you.

50:06.380 --> 50:08.300
Zach, when you said deleted,

50:08.300 --> 50:10.660
did you meant deleted by the user

50:10.660 --> 50:13.660
or deleted removed by TikTok?

50:13.660 --> 50:16.540
How would you be able to see a difference?

50:16.540 --> 50:19.440
You would only know from the poster's end.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.940
It would tell you if it had been removed.

50:21.940 --> 50:22.780
Oh, yeah.

50:22.780 --> 50:25.260
No, there wasn't a notification that it had been flagged.

50:25.780 --> 50:28.780
Good question, because some content on there

50:28.780 --> 50:30.540
could have definitely been flagged.

50:33.540 --> 50:36.460
This TikTok made me feel bad.

50:36.460 --> 50:40.300
Or misinformation, and Godel has TikTok too.

50:40.300 --> 50:43.340
Uh-oh, vroom, vroom, right?

50:43.340 --> 50:44.300
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

50:47.980 --> 50:48.820
We're here.

50:48.820 --> 50:51.900
Are we at the home of Richard Reilly

50:51.900 --> 50:54.540
or are we at the can station?

50:54.580 --> 50:55.940
Where do you think, sucker?

50:58.380 --> 51:00.620
It's the mill all over again.

51:03.820 --> 51:05.860
On your way, you get into a fiery wreck.

51:05.860 --> 51:06.680
Yeah.

51:08.300 --> 51:12.580
These characters die and everything they know dies with them.

51:12.580 --> 51:13.940
I'm done with you.

51:15.620 --> 51:17.280
You're all playing Rachel now.

51:19.700 --> 51:20.540
Wait, Rachel.

51:20.540 --> 51:21.380
Wait, Rachel.

51:21.380 --> 51:26.180
Inside the city, there's a gated community, a suburb.

51:26.180 --> 51:28.580
Wow, that's expensive.

51:28.580 --> 51:30.940
That is where Richard Reilly lives.

51:30.940 --> 51:34.180
He is an officer of the city police department

51:34.180 --> 51:38.700
and you are pulling up to a guard house outside of a gate.

51:38.700 --> 51:40.380
Is it Dave's twin brother?

51:42.140 --> 51:44.260
Think about that for a second, Julius.

51:44.260 --> 51:46.140
Wouldn't they have the same last name?

51:46.140 --> 51:47.700
No, the guard.

51:47.700 --> 51:49.340
I didn't catch Dave's last name.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.620
It's a guy who looks suspiciously like Dave.

51:56.060 --> 52:01.060
The slightly better off brother of the two.

52:01.260 --> 52:02.220
He gets to sit down.

52:02.220 --> 52:03.040
A little more hair.

52:03.040 --> 52:03.880
Yeah, out.

52:08.820 --> 52:10.460
More hair, better person.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.300
Right.

52:15.820 --> 52:19.540
Joe flicks his fucking Fabio, man.

52:19.860 --> 52:22.620
Kind of looking around, I'm like, I see what you mean.

52:25.020 --> 52:27.140
It's crazy how much hair comes out of my head

52:27.140 --> 52:28.580
and it still looks this good.

52:28.580 --> 52:29.420
Fuck you.

52:31.220 --> 52:33.560
Well, hello there.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.660
Whoa, Dave.

52:34.660 --> 52:38.960
Oh, I've always been called that my whole life, but no.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.740
And he taps slowly on his name badge.

52:41.740 --> 52:42.580
Darren.

52:42.580 --> 52:43.400
Hello, Darren.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.740
I'm Cal Colorado from the news.

52:45.740 --> 52:48.300
Whoa, it's been a while, sir.

52:48.300 --> 52:52.860
We're actually doing a report on a local security agents.

52:52.860 --> 52:53.820
Heroes.

52:53.820 --> 52:56.300
Local security heroes.

52:56.300 --> 53:00.740
Whoa, and you want to interview me?

53:00.740 --> 53:03.580
I do want to interview you, Darren.

53:03.580 --> 53:06.140
But first-

53:06.140 --> 53:08.300
Do you have a shot of adrenaline or anything?

53:09.620 --> 53:11.380
I'm sure we've got something back here,

53:11.380 --> 53:16.020
but I can Venmo you and you can source that yourself.

53:16.020 --> 53:18.580
But first we need to see an old family friend

53:18.580 --> 53:21.140
who lives in the inside.

53:21.140 --> 53:24.900
Could you let us in real quick so we can check on them?

53:24.900 --> 53:27.060
They had a small gift they wanted to give.

53:27.060 --> 53:29.180
Yeah, who are you going to see?

53:29.180 --> 53:31.060
Oh, we just call them Gramps.

53:33.560 --> 53:34.980
Will it work again?

53:36.380 --> 53:37.220
Will it blend?

53:37.220 --> 53:40.680
Will it blend, will it blend?

53:43.460 --> 53:44.620
26 pass.

53:44.620 --> 53:45.660
60 pass.

53:45.660 --> 53:46.500
Fuck you.

53:46.500 --> 53:47.860
Nice.

53:47.860 --> 53:49.940
Gramps, Gramps, Gramps, Gramps.

53:49.940 --> 53:51.420
Yeah, well, we're worried

53:51.420 --> 53:53.020
there's not much more time with Gramps.

53:53.020 --> 53:55.060
And he said he had something he really wanted to give us.

53:55.060 --> 53:57.380
But afterwards, we'll come interview you.

53:57.380 --> 54:00.900
Well, that makes me awfully excited

54:00.900 --> 54:02.780
as he clicks the button and says,

54:02.780 --> 54:06.140
tell Gramps hello and have a good day.

54:06.140 --> 54:07.460
See you soon.

54:07.460 --> 54:09.920
I'm sure he will be happy to hear from you.

54:09.920 --> 54:13.800
He speaks so highly of you and all his letters.

54:13.960 --> 54:16.760
Oh, me, wah, and you.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.640
He's beautiful, but he's dying.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.280
And we're looking for the house

54:25.280 --> 54:29.600
that has like the metal archway that says Riley on it.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.300
Gross.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.000
Yeah, there's a big one there, huh?

54:36.000 --> 54:40.600
And it's got like a shield on one side

54:40.600 --> 54:42.960
and a eagle on the other.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.160
Like, you know, laser cut into the metal.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.440
It says Lorem Ipsum.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.040
Yeah, you know, we just got some cool

54:55.040 --> 54:56.240
Latin shit put up there.

54:59.140 --> 55:02.080
Roll luck and answer the question.

55:02.080 --> 55:04.960
Well, we have to answer the question and then roll luck.

55:04.960 --> 55:06.760
What's the question?

55:06.760 --> 55:07.880
The question is,

55:07.880 --> 55:10.820
would you like there to be a car in the driveway?

55:11.780 --> 55:14.680
Seems like something you shouldn't have decided.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.580
I'll roll then.

55:19.580 --> 55:21.540
A lack of preparation on your part

55:21.540 --> 55:23.780
does not represent a crisis on ours.

55:24.780 --> 55:29.500
There is a minivan in the driveway.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.640
You said car.

55:30.640 --> 55:34.820
There is a station wagon.

55:34.820 --> 55:35.660
Damn it.

55:36.620 --> 55:37.920
He still made a family.

55:40.820 --> 55:41.660
That's a nice one.

55:41.660 --> 55:42.500
Cal brings like the C class.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.660
Actually, no, there's a shitty station wagon

55:44.660 --> 55:45.500
in the driveway.

55:46.820 --> 55:47.660
Oh, cause he doesn't.

55:47.660 --> 55:48.960
He hates his family.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.060
I hate my wife.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.940
Cal brings the C class to like a stop nearby

56:00.940 --> 56:02.700
and he's like peering over the steering wheel

56:02.700 --> 56:04.340
and kind of glaring at the scene.

56:04.340 --> 56:06.020
He's like, what do you think boys?

56:06.020 --> 56:09.140
I mean, I think as bad as much as I've ever thought

56:09.140 --> 56:10.220
this whole time.

56:10.460 --> 56:12.740
We got to get the footage, but I don't know how.

56:12.740 --> 56:14.380
I mean, do we just talk to him?

56:14.380 --> 56:17.220
I mean, we could confront him and you know,

56:17.220 --> 56:20.480
his reaction is kind of some sort of, you know, evidence,

56:20.480 --> 56:23.100
but I don't know.

56:23.100 --> 56:23.940
Maybe if we like.

56:23.940 --> 56:25.300
I don't think this is his car.

56:25.300 --> 56:26.140
First of all,

56:26.140 --> 56:29.140
I think we're going to be dealing with another mom.

56:29.140 --> 56:29.980
Yeah.

56:29.980 --> 56:31.180
Well, I can take the mom.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.940
Julius son, no offense,

56:35.940 --> 56:37.880
but you should leave the mom to me.

56:40.220 --> 56:44.100
And with that,

56:44.100 --> 56:47.620
Julius is instilled with the confidence of the group

56:47.620 --> 56:49.340
and rings the doorbell.

56:58.900 --> 57:00.100
No, thank you.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.420
Cal, Cal, use your voice.

57:04.580 --> 57:06.260
Hit him with it, Cal.

57:06.260 --> 57:07.120
Hello, ma'am.

57:07.120 --> 57:09.820
It's Cal Colorado City Action News

57:10.660 --> 57:11.480
is your husband home.

57:11.480 --> 57:12.320
Jesus Christ.

57:12.320 --> 57:13.160
Roll that.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.060
That's the stuff.

57:14.060 --> 57:15.400
That's the stuff.

57:16.500 --> 57:17.500
Roll what?

57:17.500 --> 57:20.300
Persuade, I think, or charisma.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.420
33 crit success.

57:21.420 --> 57:23.900
Holy fucking shit.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.300
Door swings open.

57:29.220 --> 57:31.020
Curlers, robe, cigarette.

57:32.180 --> 57:34.140
She goes, he never is.

57:34.140 --> 57:36.620
Cal like turns to you guys and has like a shocked look

57:36.620 --> 57:37.460
on his face.

57:37.460 --> 57:38.280
He's like, ah.

57:38.280 --> 57:40.640
She turns around, starts walking away from you

57:40.640 --> 57:42.760
and yelling over her shoulder essentially.

57:42.760 --> 57:45.680
I thought this big house would be better

57:45.680 --> 57:48.480
than leaving me alone in a shitty apartment.

57:48.480 --> 57:50.560
And I guess that's right, but fuck.

57:50.560 --> 57:51.960
Not much better it would seem.

57:51.960 --> 57:56.400
Well, you know, a woman needs attention, care,

57:56.400 --> 57:57.800
someone to love them.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.440
Yes, don't we all?

57:59.440 --> 58:00.340
Would you?

58:00.340 --> 58:01.440
She's pouring a drink.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.600
A bourbon neat, please.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.040
Oh, Beck, what would you like?

58:04.040 --> 58:07.120
Um, red bull and vodka?

58:08.560 --> 58:11.040
And Julius, this is young Julius,

58:11.040 --> 58:13.520
our new executive producer.

58:13.520 --> 58:16.240
He's kind of a rising star here at Cannes.

58:16.240 --> 58:17.680
Oh, are ya?

58:17.680 --> 58:19.240
I'd like to think that I am,

58:19.240 --> 58:22.480
but you know, I've got a lot to learn from the man.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.320
Well, if it's a ladder to climb,

58:24.320 --> 58:25.880
you'll have no problem.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.640
As she eyes you down and down.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.800
It's like, what does that mean?

58:34.920 --> 58:37.560
I was like, how does she know he's a corporate striver?

58:39.120 --> 58:42.480
She can smell it on.

58:42.480 --> 58:45.760
She can see through into men's souls.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.520
Julius flexes his thighs

58:47.520 --> 58:52.520
and you can hear like a little seam rip.

58:54.160 --> 58:57.480
Ooh, I got a little pumpin' at the lake earlier.

58:57.480 --> 58:59.920
What business do you have with my husband?

58:59.920 --> 59:01.800
Well, as she hands you each your drink.

59:01.800 --> 59:02.640
Oh, thank you.

59:02.640 --> 59:03.680
Thank you very much.

59:03.680 --> 59:04.800
What was your name, ma'am?

59:04.800 --> 59:05.640
Debs.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.160
Debs Richards?

59:07.240 --> 59:08.560
Debs Richards.

59:08.560 --> 59:11.280
Debs, Debs Riley. Richard's wife?

59:13.560 --> 59:16.000
Wow, is that all I am?

59:16.000 --> 59:16.840
Of Richard?

59:16.840 --> 59:18.000
That seems like all I am.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.840
He drags me around to these places

59:20.840 --> 59:24.040
to show me off black tie events

59:24.040 --> 59:27.200
with a bunch of the worst people in the fuckin' world.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.360
Oh, what do you mean by that?

59:28.360 --> 59:32.000
Charities, nonprofits, you know the type.

59:32.000 --> 59:32.840
Ah, yes.

59:32.840 --> 59:34.240
Yeah, evil people.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.120
Such ghouls.

59:37.200 --> 59:39.520
What is his rank in the police force?

59:39.520 --> 59:40.360
Wouldn't know it.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.760
Talking to him these days, the head on him.

59:42.760 --> 59:44.280
Just an officer.

59:44.280 --> 59:46.120
I see, and what is he doing

59:46.120 --> 59:47.760
at all these charity functions

59:47.760 --> 59:49.640
with the who's who of the city?

59:49.640 --> 59:51.440
He's rubbing elbows.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.680
He's having a good time.

59:52.680 --> 59:53.920
He's making friends.

59:53.920 --> 59:54.840
Well, you used to have to,

59:54.840 --> 59:55.680
you usually have to show up

59:55.680 --> 59:57.080
to those kinds of things with cash.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.560
I mean, I've hosted the Cal Colorado-

59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.680
Comedy Hour.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.960
Hold on, what should it be for?

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.240
Youth sports.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.840
Youth sports is solid.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.400
I've hosted the Cal Colorado Junior-

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.080
Damn it.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.000
Debate League.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.520
That's good.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.880
That's really good.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.680
I've hosted the Cal Colorado Black Tie Fundraiser

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.320
for Children's Leukemia for the last 15 years.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320
Oh wow, how much you make off that?

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.880
Oh, I don't make anything, ma'am.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.560
In fact, a great deal of my own personal money

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.480
goes into it each year,

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.760
but we've raised over $20 million in that time.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.600
Wow.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.440
Wow.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.760
Wow, wow.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.880
Perhaps you'd like to go with Julius this year.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.240
She looks up at your eyes.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.880
Yeah, we know about the thighs.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.240
How are Julius's eyes?

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.360
Julius says, my thighs are down here.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.400
We were supposed to pick up some important stuff

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.480
from your husband.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.920
He said he'd be here,

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.800
but we can just, we're kind of in a hurry.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.640
We can just grab it.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.080
If you just point us to the office,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.880
we'll be right, right as rain.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.800
I don't care.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.480
I'm in my cups and he crit succeeded, so.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.720
Oh, when was that?

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.080
Oh, I mean, as soon as I heard you

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.240
on the other side of the door.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.120
Oh, you mean me?

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.680
Yeah.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.120
Oh.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.720
I was giving you a lot of credit as a game master

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.920
and you're like, you had rolled out their interaction

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.440
as a couple earlier this morning.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.520
He crit succeeded.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.960
I'm like, what's that?

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.080
And he's like, don't fucking worry about it.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.080
Don't fucking worry about it.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.720
Yes, your husband was reviewing some footage for us

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.440
in a capacity as a expert consultant.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.360
We needed to see a law man's opinion of things.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.200
Footage?

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.400
No, he said he was taking the footage to the nature hole.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.560
The nature hole?

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.400
Yeah.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.320
Cal slams his drink and he says, thank you very much, man.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.680
Dude.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.520
Thanks, man.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.360
Thanks, bro.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.800
Thanks, man deuces.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.560
Thank you very much, man.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.680
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.560
I just remembered we're late for our interview with Darren,

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.000
your gatekeeper, but.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.400
Oh, I love Darren.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.720
He's a good guy, right?

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.120
Yeah, you can send him in.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.960
Cal is like scribbling down a number and he's like,

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.360
if you have anything else you'd like to contribute

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.680
to the story, you can reach Julius here at any time.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.880
She takes it.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.800
She slips it into her pocket.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.080
Julius is heading towards the door

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.480
and he says, I'll see you later, I guess.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.520
Lorem Ipsum.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.880
Don't blow it, kid.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.120
No, it's charming.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.720
Guys, we gotta get to the hole.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.560
We've got to get to the nature hole.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.640
The nature hole, that's where our footage is?

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.720
That's what she said, right?

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.760
Do you think it's our footage?

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.200
What other footage would he have?

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.640
That's true, he's just a cop.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.040
He's just a stupid cop.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.840
And the nature hole's on this piece of paper

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.320
that we found, too.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.160
What?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:03.920
The connection.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.480
Oh yeah, you here, look.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.400
SG, nature hole.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.880
There's some streets here and it says, follow down.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.720
Let's go.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.840
Can crew away.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.640
Thomas, Joe, take off your headphones, please.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.400
I've got something for this.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.760
I remember to bring my headphones

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.760
so I don't have to wiggle in my ears.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.920
It's really tiring when it goes on for like six minutes.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.040
Sex minutes.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.480
Chicken off only at six.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.080
When you Google nature hole,

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.520
drill bits on Alibaba come up.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.760
Interesting.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.600
That's one of my favorite bands.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.440
Did you do that?

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.120
They opened up for Wet Lake.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.600
Drill bits on Alibaba.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.440
For real?

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.280
Yeah.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.120
For real?

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.840
So, Thomas, Joe.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.680
Cool, neither one of them reacted.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.520
Hey, Luke.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.680
They're good at pretending.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:02.840
To what?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.320
Hey, you get a text on your phone?

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.160
Duh.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.000
Yeah.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:07.840
It's from-

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.680
Type.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.520
Yeah.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.360
What's it say?

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.320
Love ya.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.160
Nephew.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.360
What does it say?

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.960
It does, it starts off, I love you, nephew.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.680
I need you to come and bring Beck and Cal.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.400
I text Beck, yeah, for sure.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.840
Like I said, end of day.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.920
By the end of the day.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.800
He texts Beck, he says,

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.880
this is good news, come right now.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.240
Is there any, can I humant a text?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.160
I say, just like, what's it about?

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.520
A promotion, is the response.

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.120
Julius has a new number one priority.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.200
Yeah.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.040
Yeah.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:49.880
Should we bird him?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.720
Let's bird him.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.880
Caw, caw, caw, bird, bird, bird noise, bird noise.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.800
I am a bird.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.000
If you're a bird.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:57.840
What kind of bird are you?

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:58.840
I'm a bird.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.920
What kind of bird am I?

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.960
One that eats like bugs off a rhino.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.800
No.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.760
Oh, should we came in too early

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.720
and now we found out that he turned into a bird.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.680
What kind of bird are you, Joe?

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:10.800
Big bird.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.640
Big bird.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.160
Thomas the bird?

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.840
The kind that eats birds like you for breakfast.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.680
Dang.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.160
You guys are driving vroom vroom.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.200
Cal, you are behind the wheel.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.520
You know that the natur hole is off

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.520
in a different direction than the can station.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.320
It's gonna make you even later to this meeting

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.960
than you already are if you head that way.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.360
Guys, I hate to say it, but I think, you know,

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.240
we have to have jobs in order to break news

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.680
and type's not happy.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.280
I think we ought to stop by the station

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.640
before we go out there.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.480
Yeah.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.840
I mean, we could even, if you feel like we have to,

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.040
we can maybe talk around the issue while we're there.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.760
You know, that we kind of feel them out.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.360
Yeah, maybe I left the footage at my house

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.560
or just kind of give them the run around if we have to.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.720
I mean, you can link them to the TikToks, right?

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.320
You can show them some of what we've got.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.160
Yeah.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.080
Because once he sees what we have, I mean-

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.600
It's like proof of concept, yeah.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.060
Yeah, I'm sure I'll be like,

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.880
what are you even doing in my office?

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.400
Get back out there and follow the story.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.080
The TikToks got deleted.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:14.920
What do you mean?

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.120
I didn't want to worry you or anything,

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.000
but I wanted to go to Richard's,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.680
but I think he deleted the TikToks or someone did.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.920
Oh, I thought you were going to interview me.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.200
Okay, bye.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.420
Oh, I think that we're not even close.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.180
He said that to himself like 10 minutes

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.180
after you guys left.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.440
They're gone.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.600
Yeah, so-

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.160
Took him that long to say it.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.200
I mean, I was going to tell you, I kind of had forgotten,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.920
but I didn't want to tell you-

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.760
He combed his hair.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.400
So that we didn't go to Richard's.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.080
I think, you know,

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.160
somebody's been deleting the TikToks.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.840
Tyve is not happy with us.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.880
I think we got to go.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.120
I think we got to go talk to him.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.040
It sounds like he wants to shut us down.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.380
That adds a new wrinkle that, yeah,

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.520
that sounds like he's maybe,

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.440
I'm sorry, Julius, but maybe he's in on this?

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.780
Yes, as the Blues Brothers say,

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.400
this is track four, by the way.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.720
It's cheaper to keep her about our jobs,

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.680
but I don't know,

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.980
it sounds like he doesn't want us to do our jobs.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.080
If we get the footage,

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.640
we could sell it to any news agency in the world.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.040
It's true, we might need to start thinking global.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.680
We can go beyond these bastards.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.800
Wouldn't it be easier to just keep our jobs

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.080
and do it here, though?

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.120
We have a lead on where the footage is right now.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.420
If we don't act, we might never get it back.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.540
Julius has a point, though,

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:36.760
that if we can maybe do some creative talking to Tyve,

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.120
maybe we'll get some resources

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.960
that can help us with our actual goal.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.180
And we can just buy some time.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.720
I mean, he's not going to fire us immediately

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.360
if, you know, we don't really tell him exactly

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.760
if he's on Godel's side, then.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.520
We could even play the fool and be like,

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.200
yeah, this is for the good of Godel.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.420
Cal slams the brakes, and he says,

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:01.460
I didn't nearly die in that piss-shit common blood pit

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.420
just to lose the evidence of it.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.180
No one's gonna call Cal Colorado a liar about this.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.640
If you wanna go see Tyve, take a fucking Uber.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.340
I'm going to the natural hole.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.760
I'm getting my story.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.640
Take off your headphones real quick, Thomas and Joe.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.320
As both a player and as Julius, I am torn.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.520
You get a new text.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.480
It says, just you is fine.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.320
On my way.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.140
Birds?

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.020
Birds.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.920
I can't have me getting fired on my resume.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.640
I gotta go see my uncle.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.280
Will you guys please come with me?

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.600
Yeah, um.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.560
Beck, go with him.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.720
Yeah, I'll come, I'll come, Julius.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.600
Cal, we should all go together,

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.560
but we just gotta check in with Tyve.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.480
I think he's gonna fire you anyway, Julius.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.320
Well.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.480
I think you tell him to go fuck himself.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.840
If you're gonna go.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.680
You'll get a job once you put out

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.700
the greatest news story of all time.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.100
I gotta go, but if you're gonna go anyway,

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.740
Beck, you should be there to document it.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.720
I can do it on my own.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.980
It's, it's just my uncle.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.920
Hey, remember that we lost God?

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.760
Yeah.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.060
Yeah, no, I wouldn't let Cal go alone.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.420
I'm just, if Julius is saying that we need to go to Tyve,

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.340
I don't, I don't know.

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.900
It feels like maybe, maybe we should go see Tyve

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.540
and then go to the natural hole.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.080
Call him again.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.880
Actually, I'm going to call him.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.720
Oh, okay.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.800
Cal calls Tyve.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.400
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.760
Hey, it's my guy, Cal Colorado.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.620
How are you?

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:27.380
Oh, well, not very great, Tyve.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.880
Yeah, get your ass down here.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.120
I got some great fucking news for you.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.800
You wanna be sitting at that head anchor desk again?

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.240
I take the phone off speaker.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.080
Julius is looking at Beck like, Beck is giving thumbs up.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.460
Holy shit, holy shit.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:41.300
What do you mean?

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.460
I got an opportunity.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.320
It's promotion time, but I need you and Julius

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.520
and Beck to come in.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.760
Why do you need us to come in?

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.040
Because we have to do the paperwork

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.960
for your new promotion, of course.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.840
I've got to tell you, Tyve,

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.580
we're working on something really big here.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:55.420
I don't care.

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.720
I think the paperwork can wait.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.000
It's going to be great.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.500
I need you to come in now.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.560
It's my promotion, Tyve, so.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.800
Well, we'll see.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.380
Isabella feels real confident in that spot, you know?

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.720
So I want to give it to you,

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.200
but I need you guys to come in.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.480
Tyve, you've already taken this from me once.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.000
I don't know if I trust your word,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.120
but if you love Julius, if you love me,

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.380
if you actually care about your job here at the news,

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.240
you're going to want to let us pursue this story.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.160
I love my job.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.720
I love my life.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.920
And I need you to come in.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.860
So it's either that,

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.760
or I think we're going to have to have some harsher words.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.580
Tyve?

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:33.420
Unfortunately.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.900
Beck has given signals to get Cal's attention.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.400
Joe is pointing down.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.360
He's trying to muffle the receiver.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.200
Joe is playing in a screwable game of tricks.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.600
Muffle the receiver.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.920
Muffle it.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.860
Take it off your ear and muffle it.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.640
I take it off my ear and like make a play show

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.480
of putting it on mute.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.280
And he's like, I know about you.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.540
Oh shit, hell yeah, Cal.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.800
Dude, Cal, if he's offering to make you an anchor,

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.240
that's a win-win for us because you'll have the desk.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.040
He can't tell you shit once you're live on air.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.200
We just run the footage.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.760
We're talking about to tape right now.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.160
If you're on air and I put that thing in the video bay.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.200
But we don't have the tape.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.880
We'll have to get it, but I'm saying.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.760
He's got it.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.240
Or someone working with him.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.620
Or the people paying them both.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.460
Don't you see?

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.280
Tyfe's in on it.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.120
Tyfe wants to kill it.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.280
I don't think you're wrong,

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.520
but I also think that we can still make.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.560
The anchor job is never going to happen.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.620
He's trying to play me.

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.000
Unless he wants to put you on anchor to shut you up

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.340
and stop investigating.

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.660
That's exactly what he wants.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.460
I'm saying we can get you on anchor and then we use that.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.360
He promises it to me, but then never gives it.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.200
Don't you see?

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.000
He can't control us outside of the office.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.240
That's exactly my point.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.760
We're outside of the office.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.080
He cannot control us.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.160
But I'm saying if we go now to the natural

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.200
and he just does straight up fire us.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.020
So what?

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:45.860
We post it on TikTok.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.200
We make a new TikTok.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.560
We're locked out of the can TikTok.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.680
It keeps getting deleted.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.080
We'll make a cow TikTok.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.640
But none of this is live on air.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.160
This is all things that they control.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.680
We've already seen that they got TikTok under wraps.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.860
We'll make a new TikTok.

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.560
I think that they have the ability to take that stuff down.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.120
What I'm saying is that we have the chance

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.640
to put this in front of eyeballs,

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.440
no matter who tells you no.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.760
Once we get you on air live.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.840
We have that if we have the footage, no matter what.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.800
We can ship it to a dozen news agencies.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.080
We can put it live on as many platforms as possible.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.080
It's not live then though.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.640
It's all to tape and they get to decide when they run it.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.080
Beck, I'm talking about the internet.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:20.920
Yeah.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.400
Guys, I'm gonna have to go.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.540
Are you coming?

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.240
I would strongly advise against you going to that meeting.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.620
Your uncle is not looking out for your best interests

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.220
and your career will live beyond this,

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.080
especially if you're part of the most legendary news story

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:34.900
of all time.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.360
The movie's happening in this car, Julius.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.800
He looks at Cloud Atlas.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.840
Hey, hey, I know Tom Hanks is magnetic in that movie.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.540
It's one of my favorites,

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.920
but if you ever want to be the kind of person

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.080
who produces the next Cloud Atlas

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:55.320
or runs City Action News or a national news station,

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.440
this story is how you get your foot in that door,

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.440
not your uncle.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.040
If he fires you, screw him.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.960
I'll give you every recommendation in the world.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.520
Ty fangs up.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.160
Oh yeah, we kept him on mute for like seven minutes.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.000
I don't know, Cal.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.160
I think if I'm gonna do this, it's all about who, you know?

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.560
And I don't want to be like a Snowden or something

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.400
and get sent off because of the Godel company.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.240
I gotta go.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:22.280
And yeah, Julius just kind of looks at Cal and Beck

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.440
and like Beck looks at Cal.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.600
Cal, you know I'm gonna follow you wherever we go,

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.620
but I think that Julius has a point here.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.000
We're going two different ways, Beck.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.800
Who you go with is up to you.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.640
Julius orders a Uber.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.380
Yeah, no, Cal, I'm your cameraman.

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.560
I'll meet back up with you guys.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.400
I'll make sure he doesn't fire you.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.600
Julius, don't go.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.000
A tear runs down Julius's eye

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.240
as he waits for the car to stop and gets out.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.080
Car's been stopped.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.120
He looks at the...

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.400
What are you waiting for?

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.280
My Harry Anderson juke.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.980
Go on, get out of here.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.560
As the credits roll on Cloud Atlas, Julius exits the car.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.060
Cal is just like weeping.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.040
Julius is crying too.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.560
Beck just says to himself,

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.260
God, I hope he's right about this.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.820
Luke, Julius Summers takes the Uber back

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:27.380
to the city action news station.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.920
You get out and you head in

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.360
over that marbled, marvelous floor, head upstairs.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.040
As you make your way upstairs,

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.920
you see the door to your Uncle Ty Frailand's office

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.720
is closed and you hear whistling

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.520
coming from the other side.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.520
When you make it to the door,

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.040
and when you open up the door,

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.940
you see standing behind his desk, your Uncle Ty Frailand.

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:08.260
And sitting at the two chairs facing Ty's desk,

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:13.260
looking back toward you is a tall, mousy police officer

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:18.500
wearing glasses and a short, jacked, bald police officer.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.160
Two whole new characters.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.460
And you recognize who?

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.740
Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.900
That's right.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.500
Confidently, he says.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.220
And how does Julius feel in this moment?

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:35.420
Disappointed in himself,

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:40.420
yet excited at the prospect of a promotion.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.560
Nice.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.180
Thomas, Joe, Beck Wilder in Cal, Colorado,

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.100
head the dream team, if you will,

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:59.100
to the Natcher Hole in Cal, Colorado's Mercedes C-Class.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.300
And when you pull up-

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.500
This is the start of some PTPB erotic fan fiction.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.500
Oh my God.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.140
It is straight for the natural.

01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.680
When we go to the northeast corner.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.800
When you head to the northeast corner,

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.660
you see that there is a subway station there.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:23.280
And from the car, you see walking up

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.740
out of this subway station at just this moment,

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.740
with a wall of dark hair flowing down

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:36.060
over their eyes, covering their nose,

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:40.660
only showing their bottom black lip pierced with a hoop.

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:46.980
SG, Stevie Godel.

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.540
Son of a bitch, Beck.

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.380
Holy shit, it's Stevie.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.580
Cal leans out the window and hawks a horn and goes,

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:53.780
Hi Stevie.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.460
Beck is waving to you.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.300
Over here.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.700
Stevie, Stevie, Stevie, it's us.

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:03.700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.540
It's great, and it's all my fault.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.760
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.500
Cause my life is great.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.340
What I meant to say was actually,

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.020
I feel so seen right now.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.100
Cal looks up, and crosses himself and points up.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.460
Sammy Sosa.

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.380
Sammy Sosa.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.220
What?

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.120
Nothing.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.960
And it's all my fault.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.120
It's all my fault.
