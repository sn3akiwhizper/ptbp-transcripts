00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
God damn it, y'all.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.740
Shit just keeps getting weirder and weirder around here.

00:05.740 --> 00:10.000
It's your trap tricky trusted teacher wolf the dog,

00:10.000 --> 00:14.080
and I am no longer surrounded by walls.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.880
From my cage, I can see that there is a lot

00:16.880 --> 00:21.000
of bizarre alien thingies all around me.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.520
Bio luminescence, mushroomy thingies.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.740
What the fuck is going on around here?

00:28.740 --> 00:31.220
I guess the show still must go on.

00:31.220 --> 00:34.540
Bullshit working conditions is what this is.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.620
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from

00:36.620 --> 00:41.380
At Super Nerd Jeff, who is located in Slovenia.

00:41.380 --> 00:43.900
At Super Nerd Jeff tweeted about the show

00:43.900 --> 00:46.460
and tagged At Pretending Pod,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.960
the second coolest thing you can do in Slovenia.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.660
The first, dance with the fairies on Bled Island.

00:53.660 --> 00:56.560
Those little groovers really know how to cut a wool,

00:56.560 --> 00:58.060
if you know what I mean.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.820
And if you don't, do some damn research.

01:00.820 --> 01:03.900
Wolf ain't gonna spoon feed you every morsel,

01:03.900 --> 01:05.540
but I am gonna have.

01:05.540 --> 01:08.220
At Super Nerd Jeff writes,

01:08.220 --> 01:11.220
I hope this message reaches you safely, wolf.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.480
I don't know which lines of communication

01:13.480 --> 01:14.980
are safe these days.

01:14.980 --> 01:19.980
You and the boys are doing God's work over at 694.2 PTBP.

01:21.020 --> 01:24.700
Handlers, agents, and dogs everywhere

01:24.700 --> 01:27.140
could take a leaf out of your creepy freckled

01:27.140 --> 01:28.780
human skin book.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.700
To my own agents, it is coming.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.180
The future we have waited and worked so long for.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.540
Foretold in years past, born of pestilence

01:38.540 --> 01:40.820
and fermented in solitude.

01:40.820 --> 01:42.700
Prepare yourselves.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.360
Much love from the safe house in Slovenia.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.120
Keep up the fine work, fellas.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.060
Now I don't know where your safe house is, Jeff,

01:53.060 --> 01:55.060
but if you ever run into the dragon

01:55.060 --> 01:57.860
that kicks it under Ljubljana Castle,

01:57.860 --> 02:02.100
tell him wolf says he regrets calling him a girthy drake,

02:02.100 --> 02:04.820
and I miss their earthy quakes.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.580
I bet all that's just for Jeff.

02:07.580 --> 02:12.240
Unless a few of y'all have read a book or two on Slovenia.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.780
If you wanna write up something

02:13.780 --> 02:16.060
for your trapped wolf to how,

02:16.060 --> 02:19.340
and then make very specific references to,

02:19.340 --> 02:21.900
tag at pretending pod on Twitter,

02:21.900 --> 02:24.340
tag at pretending pod on Instagram,

02:24.340 --> 02:26.740
tag pretending to be people on Facebook

02:26.740 --> 02:28.700
or fuck Mark Zuckerberg,

02:28.700 --> 02:31.900
or you can write a five star review on Apple Podcasts

02:31.900 --> 02:35.620
and holler about it to pretendingpod at gmail.com.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.660
Also, money.

02:37.660 --> 02:38.660
We'll take it.

02:38.660 --> 02:41.840
If you wanna join the Patreon exclusive t-shirt club,

02:41.840 --> 02:46.040
head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.580
And remember, if you join our Patreon

02:48.580 --> 02:52.260
or upgrade your tier during the month of November,

02:52.260 --> 02:53.860
we're gonna take that money,

02:54.300 --> 02:55.140
we're gonna match it,

02:55.140 --> 02:57.060
and we're gonna buy blankets and tents

02:57.060 --> 02:59.900
for folks who need them this winter.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.380
You fine folks have already raised $185.

03:04.380 --> 03:07.600
So with PTBP's matching contribution,

03:07.600 --> 03:12.300
we have $370 so far to spend on needed supplies

03:12.300 --> 03:15.080
to help our community get through this winter.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.320
Only 11 days left, y'all.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.780
And how about this?

03:18.780 --> 03:22.260
If we hit $333 from y'all,

03:22.260 --> 03:23.660
that would double on up

03:23.660 --> 03:27.940
to the very cool number of $666.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.340
If that happens, Wolf will give away

03:30.340 --> 03:34.540
a couple fine t-shirts with the PTBP logo

03:34.540 --> 03:37.220
to a couple of fine patrons.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.220
So sign up for the Patreon this November, my babies.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.620
You'll get a butt ton of bonus content

03:43.620 --> 03:47.340
and the fuzzy warm feeling of helping others.

03:47.340 --> 03:51.780
Speaking of fuzzy warm feelings, it's time for the news.

03:51.780 --> 03:56.780
Last time, Incel accused a cool mom of being on drugs,

03:56.860 --> 03:59.460
accused the sheriff of not caring enough

03:59.460 --> 04:03.380
about a missing girl, accused the father of that missing girl

04:03.380 --> 04:06.540
and Alderman of Grover'sville, Tennessee

04:06.540 --> 04:09.020
of being produced by inbreeding,

04:09.020 --> 04:13.180
and emailed Scott Adams, who is either a UFO guy,

04:13.180 --> 04:15.220
the Dilbert guy, or both.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.780
Finally, they called Merle's shut eye,

04:17.780 --> 04:20.500
pretended to be a Clark County deputy,

04:20.500 --> 04:23.420
and learned that Scott Adams has two rooms there

04:23.420 --> 04:26.180
at the same motel they're staying in.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.620
Two rooms for one dude?

04:28.620 --> 04:31.420
Hm, Wolfie is skeptical,

04:31.420 --> 04:34.900
but now for something absolutely impeccable,

04:34.900 --> 04:37.820
it's Brat Pit with Miss Mary.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.940
Psy moves out,

04:39.940 --> 04:43.140
but the eyes hold one throw

04:48.220 --> 04:51.860
I gotta work in the morning

04:52.980 --> 04:56.020
And this shit's so important

04:56.020 --> 04:58.500
So I can't get high

05:00.140 --> 05:03.380
No, I can't get high

05:05.540 --> 05:07.200
Theinge siega die

05:07.860 --> 05:10.580
I can't get high

05:10.580 --> 05:13.780
There must be something inside of me

05:13.780 --> 05:16.500
Does anybody know why?

05:17.940 --> 05:21.140
I can't get high

05:21.140 --> 05:22.820
We're here with David Winters.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.780
David.

05:23.780 --> 05:24.620
Hi.

05:24.620 --> 05:25.620
Luke has a question for you.

05:25.620 --> 05:26.460
Oh, no.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.700
Yeah, so let me set the scene.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.860
We're not recording this though, are we?

05:31.860 --> 05:34.500
No, yeah, we're recording.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.300
Wait, did you get this question from a bigger podcast?

05:37.380 --> 05:39.980
No, I just like thought of it.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.940
I think I was like pooping and I thought of it.

05:42.940 --> 05:43.780
So, all right.

05:43.780 --> 05:46.100
If you make a lie gross enough, no one questions it.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.940
You're accusing me and I resent that.

05:50.940 --> 05:54.080
This is from the dome.

05:54.080 --> 05:59.080
David, you can pick only one movie that Tom Hanks is in

06:00.340 --> 06:02.020
and keep Tom Hanks in it,

06:02.020 --> 06:05.160
but then you have to replace every other movie he's in

06:05.160 --> 06:06.940
with a different actor,

06:07.420 --> 06:09.060
but then you have to pick who that actor is.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.420
So, three part question, two part question.

06:11.420 --> 06:15.660
One, what movie is Tom Hanks going to stay in his role

06:15.660 --> 06:18.760
and then what actor would you replace

06:18.760 --> 06:21.860
every other Tom Hanks role with?

06:21.860 --> 06:22.700
Oh, that's good.

06:22.700 --> 06:23.960
He's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.800
That's what I said.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.100
Yeah, he's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.420
I know that much.

06:27.420 --> 06:31.240
As far as every other movie.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.740
So like, what are some highlights?

06:32.740 --> 06:34.420
What movies do we need to think about?

06:34.420 --> 06:36.100
Philadelphia Castaway.

06:37.060 --> 06:37.900
Terminal.

06:37.900 --> 06:38.900
Turner and Hooch, Terminal.

06:38.900 --> 06:39.740
Sully.

06:39.740 --> 06:40.560
Sully.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.400
Sully.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.720
Joe versus volcano.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.420
You've got male, Sleepless in Seattle.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.220
You're the captain now, Phillips man.

06:47.220 --> 06:49.740
This is easy too then.

06:49.740 --> 06:50.580
Nicolas Cage.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.420
Oh, nice.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.940
Perfect, perfect answer.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.260
That's better than anything we ever came up with.

06:57.260 --> 07:00.140
Yeah, that's the most chaotic answer you can give,

07:00.140 --> 07:01.480
besides like Gary Busey.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.900
Do you remember the scene in the terminal

07:04.900 --> 07:08.340
where he's in the bathroom and he just starts screaming?

07:10.020 --> 07:11.700
He does the scene for Mandy,

07:11.700 --> 07:13.460
but in terminal. In every movie.

07:17.460 --> 07:18.460
Let's kill some aliens.

07:18.460 --> 07:19.860
What were your answers?

07:19.860 --> 07:21.340
I heard Forrest Gump was a yes.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.960
I said Forrest Gump and then Colin Hanks.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.940
I was gonna keep him in Castaway

07:28.940 --> 07:31.380
and maybe like Sam Rockwell.

07:31.380 --> 07:34.100
Some character actor I think could do all of his oeuvre.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.380
I think Sam Rockwell would be good.

07:36.380 --> 07:40.500
I chose, the movie that I chose is that one

07:40.500 --> 07:44.660
where he is the guy.

07:44.660 --> 07:47.340
I feel like you don't know what you're gonna say yet.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.340
I should have let Thomas go next.

07:50.340 --> 07:51.420
Yeah, I'll give you some time.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.220
I would keep him in the cinematic masterpiece, Cloud Atlas

07:56.500 --> 08:00.780
and replace him and everything else with Danny DeVito.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.100
There you go.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.540
Danny DeVito is Forrest Gump.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.760
That would be the greatest movie of all time.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.940
I'm gonna keep him in That Thing You Do

08:12.940 --> 08:15.300
just to keep that movie pristine as possible,

08:15.300 --> 08:16.940
especially because I talked about that.

08:16.940 --> 08:19.980
I don't want Vin Diesel playing that role,

08:19.980 --> 08:23.460
which is who I'm gonna have play all of the other roles.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.300
I do want Vin Diesel as Forrest Gump.

08:25.300 --> 08:30.300
It's about family, Ginny.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.380
Family is a life of box of chocolates.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.900
You never know what you're gonna get.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.260
Yeah, oddly enough,

08:38.260 --> 08:40.900
the Chronicles of Riddick is all Tom Hanks now.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.380
That would be awesome.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.860
Tom Hanks goes down to Cuba and he's like,

08:49.860 --> 08:51.860
that means we're family.

08:51.860 --> 08:54.980
If the question is instead like whose careers would you flop?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.980
Then Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel is a very fun answer.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.420
And at the end of episode two.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.540
We got some information from a hotel clerk

09:08.540 --> 09:12.380
that Scott Adams was renting a room where we're staying

09:12.380 --> 09:15.480
and there was also, he had a second room full of research.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.340
The hotel clerk knew that that second room

09:17.340 --> 09:19.660
was full of research, if I remember right.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.260
It's amazing that that hotel employee knew.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.140
Maybe he mentions it

09:23.140 --> 09:24.820
at the continental breakfast every morning.

09:25.180 --> 09:26.660
He's like, love this lobby coffee,

09:26.660 --> 09:28.300
really helps me with my research,

09:28.300 --> 09:30.300
which is what I use that second room for.

09:34.220 --> 09:37.100
Did we learn the hotel clerk's name?

09:37.100 --> 09:38.940
You did, it was Riker Yates.

09:38.940 --> 09:41.060
That's right, strong name.

09:41.060 --> 09:42.100
Riker Yates.

09:42.100 --> 09:42.940
You live in New York.

09:42.940 --> 09:46.120
Do you ever just go to Riker Island for fun?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.460
No, not really.

09:49.260 --> 09:52.980
There's better islands, including Manhattan itself.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.620
But yeah, I generally avoid Rikers.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.700
At least what the tourist guides say is try not to.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.040
Do you ever get sent there against your will

10:00.040 --> 10:01.580
for the crimes you've committed?

10:03.180 --> 10:06.100
I don't have to answer that under advice from counsel.

10:07.060 --> 10:07.900
Smart guy.

10:07.900 --> 10:08.800
I plead the fifth.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.700
Not a prereq for my appearance here.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.900
You didn't read the fine print, David.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.180
There's a reason why I have to record this remotely

10:16.180 --> 10:18.100
and I can't fly in for the show.

10:18.100 --> 10:18.940
I'm not allowed to leave the states.

10:18.940 --> 10:21.020
That's the nicest sell I've ever seen.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.020
Yes.

10:23.860 --> 10:25.500
They let you have so many games.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.380
It's true, it's true.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.100
So we're at the hotel.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.020
Well, not really hotel, it's a motel.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.900
And I know that that's near and dear

10:34.900 --> 10:39.900
to certain other detectives' hearts and another property.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.580
This is Merle's shut eye is what you called,

10:43.580 --> 10:46.100
or who you called, the place you called,

10:46.100 --> 10:48.180
the person you called was Riker Yates.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.420
You're still far away though.

10:49.460 --> 10:50.580
If I recall correctly,

10:50.580 --> 10:54.640
did you call on the fancy DEA Crown Victoria car phone

10:54.640 --> 10:56.480
or did you call from the city hall?

10:56.480 --> 10:58.580
I think we called from the office, yeah.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.660
The city hall office, okay.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.380
So you led away the alderman.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.980
Right, I think we told him to fuck off.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.340
Yes, like many of the other NPCs

11:07.340 --> 11:08.620
that you've encountered so far,

11:08.620 --> 11:10.860
you have thoroughly harassed them

11:10.860 --> 11:13.020
asking about disappearing people

11:13.020 --> 11:16.680
and you constantly bring up aliens for no apparent reason

11:16.680 --> 11:18.580
even though that's a complete trigger point

11:18.580 --> 11:20.240
for every resident around here.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.220
Accurate, yep.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.220
You've made a phone call.

11:23.220 --> 11:27.940
It is what, around probably about midnight at this point

11:27.940 --> 11:30.100
on thirsty Thursday night.

11:30.100 --> 11:30.940
Oh yeah, that's right.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.340
Oh yeah, so we could go down to the reservoir.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.860
Thank you for bringing that up.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.820
I had forgotten about it.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.500
The question is, what do you wanna do next?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.940
It's getting late, day one.

11:39.940 --> 11:42.980
Do you guys, do you think we should...

11:42.980 --> 11:45.460
I mean, we're gonna go back to the motel.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.980
Anyway, we gotta stay there.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.860
Should we go crash the kids party?

11:49.860 --> 11:51.240
Go down to the reservoir?

11:51.240 --> 11:53.780
I mean, we should at least drive by probably, yeah.

11:53.780 --> 11:58.020
It would give us a chance to see if there's any connections

11:58.020 --> 12:03.020
in the youth where all these missing kids are coming from.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.540
So-called missing kids.

12:05.540 --> 12:09.340
We have that raging Billy Ray just shouting in pain.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.740
Who fucking knows if there's a lot of kids missing?

12:11.740 --> 12:14.220
Yeah, but if Jane Allen is also missing

12:14.220 --> 12:18.260
and then everyone seems to not be worried

12:18.260 --> 12:19.180
about missing people.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.700
I'm worried that these teens themselves

12:21.700 --> 12:23.020
won't fucking be worried

12:23.020 --> 12:24.580
that any of their friends are missing.

12:24.580 --> 12:25.420
That's a worrying thought.

12:25.420 --> 12:28.700
My theory is that we've only talked to grown adults.

12:28.700 --> 12:33.420
Maybe the younger crew might actually be concerned about it

12:33.420 --> 12:34.940
because it's their friends that are going.

12:34.940 --> 12:36.740
Reservoir would be the place to go then.

12:36.740 --> 12:40.300
What if there's like a scrappy group of role-playing nerds?

12:40.300 --> 12:41.340
Then we kill them.

12:41.340 --> 12:44.820
Who befriend a supernatural bald girl.

12:47.780 --> 12:50.580
How many of them do you think there'd be?

12:50.580 --> 12:51.980
The supernatural kind.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.660
Well, just one, but her name would be Eleven.

12:53.660 --> 12:58.420
Okay, all right, all right, I was just wondering.

12:58.420 --> 13:01.820
Am I off-putting to you, the three of you in this room,

13:01.820 --> 13:03.860
now that it was just the four of us in here,

13:03.860 --> 13:07.180
do I come across as a little too fucking strong?

13:07.180 --> 13:11.140
I like your tattoos, but that whole thing,

13:11.980 --> 13:13.260
I'm not a fan of that.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.100
Why?

13:14.100 --> 13:14.940
I didn't like it.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.420
Sometimes you do say things

13:16.420 --> 13:20.140
that I feel put the investigation in jeopardy.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.420
She's pulling on the sleeves of her cardigan

13:22.420 --> 13:24.060
that she has on,

13:24.060 --> 13:27.620
but she's not using her like cardigan persona currently.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.500
And she kind of pulls the sleeves down over her tattoos.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.700
She had them rolled up from the intensity of the phone call

13:33.700 --> 13:34.980
and the email and the computer.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.300
And as she rolls the sleeves down,

13:36.300 --> 13:38.420
she looks at all of you and her face changes again.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.260
And she's just like, okay,

13:41.260 --> 13:45.940
Cindy Woodabaga is gonna be very, very nice.

13:45.940 --> 13:47.580
Is that better for you?

13:47.580 --> 13:50.820
Joe Dean's face falls, but he doesn't say anything,

13:50.820 --> 13:52.940
but he looks like he's seen this before

13:52.940 --> 13:54.660
and he's even more worried now.

13:57.380 --> 14:01.580
Cindy, is this like a Bruce Banner Hulk situation?

14:01.580 --> 14:05.600
Can we call on that other version of you if we need it?

14:06.600 --> 14:08.800
Just rip my cardigan off

14:08.800 --> 14:12.120
and I guess we'll see what comes out.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.120
It's just, she's still a little flirty.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.720
She runs her fingers down Harlan Nash's chest.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.400
Is that okay?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.640
Sure, for now.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.280
It's better though than before.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.120
Yeah.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.600
Tan gets a little jealous.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.280
How old are Harlan and Tan?

14:36.280 --> 14:38.080
Tan is 38.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.600
Harlan's 46.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.840
I'll be good.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.760
And she looks at her partner, Joe Dean

14:42.760 --> 14:44.160
and her eyes get really big.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.280
I'll be good.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.680
And then we all hop in the car and go to the reservoir.

14:47.680 --> 14:48.520
Yep.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.340
Yeah.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.180
Yep.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.860
Okay.

14:54.180 --> 14:57.360
We wanna make some prank calls on our car phone first though.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.360
Bling, bling.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.600
Hello, White House?

15:05.600 --> 15:08.400
Yeah, let me talk to the president.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.780
How did you get this number?

15:09.780 --> 15:11.480
What are your thoughts on aliens?

15:13.160 --> 15:14.880
We call Murrells County Bunker.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.680
Yeah, grab your prop phone, David.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.200
And I haven't heard the ring yet.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.600
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.320
Hey y'all, it's Murrells.

15:25.720 --> 15:29.400
Howdy, we're staying down at Murrell's shutout tonight

15:29.400 --> 15:32.200
and we were wondering how long the bunker's open.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.040
Huh?

15:34.040 --> 15:36.120
Well, technically it's open till 12,

15:36.120 --> 15:40.280
but if you say the password, it's open till two.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.620
What's the password?

15:41.620 --> 15:43.760
Big League Chew.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.720
Big League Chew, that's cool.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.560
Yeah.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.320
Hey, ask him if Mr. Jazz is there.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.400
Hey, is Mr. Jazz there?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.280
Hugh Jazz.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.120
Hugh Jazz?

15:56.960 --> 16:01.960
Hey, we got Hugh Jazz in here, anyone?

16:04.640 --> 16:06.120
Oh, hang up, hang up, hang up.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.880
Hey, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.000
Oh my God, it's just like the Simpsons.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.280
We don't got no Hugh Jazz.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.960
I can't believe it worked, hang up.

16:17.960 --> 16:18.800
I hang up, yeah.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.840
It's just like that animated 10 year old boy

16:23.880 --> 16:26.320
that's taken the nation by storm these last couple of years.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.920
I'm just waiting for, once we get in like a gunfight

16:29.920 --> 16:32.800
for David to just bring a gun out as a prop.

16:35.040 --> 16:35.880
It's like, yeah, I got a phone.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.960
He fires in and bullets come out of our TV screen.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.520
Whoa.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.340
4D.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.200
Four dead.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.140
All right, any more prank phone calls

16:45.140 --> 16:46.120
before you go to the reservoir?

16:46.120 --> 16:46.960
Sure, why not?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.520
How many prank phone calls does it take

16:48.520 --> 16:49.880
to get to the reservoir?

16:50.120 --> 16:54.120
Sorry, your car phone's out of minutes.

16:54.120 --> 16:58.200
You only have the 30 minute monthly plan.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.240
Two things, first, are we there yet?

17:00.240 --> 17:03.640
And second, can I change Ice Cube to my answer

17:03.640 --> 17:05.200
for switching with Tom Hanks?

17:07.520 --> 17:10.320
Yes and yes, Ice Cube would be good.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.720
Is Ice Cube in Law and Order or is that Ice T?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.560
That's Ice T, Ice T.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.560
Which one's Ice Cube?

17:16.560 --> 17:17.520
Ice Cube is the-

17:17.520 --> 17:18.600
Are we there yet?

17:18.600 --> 17:19.440
Are we there yet?

17:19.920 --> 17:24.920
And 21 Jump Street, 22 Jump Street, Barbershop.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.480
Man, Barbershop's a funny movie.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.300
All right, let's go.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.140
It'd be good.

17:29.140 --> 17:29.980
What do we see?

17:29.980 --> 17:30.800
Well, more importantly, what do you hear?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.580
So in between your prank phone calls on the way there,

17:33.580 --> 17:36.920
a bump in tune from 1990 comes on.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.920
Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby, just to get you in the mood.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.360
All right, stop, collaborate and listen.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.400
Ice is back with a brand new invention.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.240
Something.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.400
You guys are holding me tightly.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.440
Flowing like a hot daily and nightly.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.680
When will it ever stop, yo?

17:56.680 --> 17:57.520
I don't know.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.360
Turn out the lights and I'll glow to the extreme.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.680
I rock the mic like a vandal.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.360
Light up the stage and watch me shine like a candle dance.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.880
Harlan, they really just had a little bonding moment there.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.600
I think your chances with Cindy just went way down.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.180
She knew every word.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.580
She's good.

18:15.580 --> 18:18.880
You go to the reservoir, you encounter,

18:18.880 --> 18:19.720
hold on,

18:22.500 --> 18:27.500
three teens loitering and a beat up Ford pickup truck

18:27.880 --> 18:30.820
and pounding cans of, hold on,

18:30.820 --> 18:33.600
I have to roll on my random beer table.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.520
Oh, hell yeah.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.360
Oh, that's an 11.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.500
Is this 13 Mile Island?

18:37.500 --> 18:38.340
Oh my God.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.480
That's an 11.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.320
They're drinking Milwaukee's Best Ice.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.160
Excellent.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.940
Six percenters getting it.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.440
That is, they are partying.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.680
David, is that a chart of your own devising?

18:50.840 --> 18:51.680
Oh yeah.

18:51.680 --> 18:54.620
Were you just going to say that no matter what you roll?

18:54.620 --> 18:55.460
No, no, no, no.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.000
There's other ones I can roll for you.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.200
A two is Colt 45.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.040
Oh my gosh.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.740
Did you make sure all these beers were on the market

19:02.740 --> 19:03.580
in 1990?

19:05.640 --> 19:08.800
Anything you can buy in Tallboys in a gas station today

19:08.800 --> 19:10.760
probably existed 20 years ago.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.800
Like Steel Reserve, Colt 45.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.400
Milwaukee's Best Ice.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.860
Colt 45 definitely existed

19:17.220 --> 19:21.260
because Lando Calrissian was effectively the spokesperson.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.100
Yeah, I'm not saying you could have a better time.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.540
David, what's your go-to shitty beer?

19:25.540 --> 19:26.980
Hold on, let me roll for you.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.300
That'd be Bud Light.

19:31.740 --> 19:33.340
Missouri, baby.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.480
Doody Doody.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.540
Anheuser-Busch.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.540
Wait, what did they say?

19:36.540 --> 19:37.740
In Bev.

19:37.740 --> 19:38.700
Wait, what?

19:38.700 --> 19:39.640
Doody Doody.

19:39.640 --> 19:40.480
Doody Doody.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.380
No, Diddy Diddy.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.980
Right?

19:43.980 --> 19:45.060
Poopy Poopy.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.420
I forget.

19:46.900 --> 19:47.740
Dilly Dilly.

19:47.740 --> 19:48.560
Dilly Dilly.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.400
Dilly Dilly.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.240
Yes, there we go.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.460
That's what we're looking for.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.040
Those were bad commercials.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.540
I liked the dog ones.

19:54.540 --> 19:55.500
Those were good.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.340
Anyway.

19:56.340 --> 19:58.260
Oh, where the dogs say Budweiser.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.620
We're at the reservoir, I guess.

20:01.620 --> 20:02.460
Milwaukee's Best.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.300
They're crushing Milwaukee's Best Ice.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.300
Yeah, the beast.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.420
Tan gets out of the car,

20:07.420 --> 20:10.180
finds the open 18-pack,

20:10.180 --> 20:12.340
grabs one, cracks it open,

20:12.340 --> 20:15.060
and just kind of wanders into where the kids are.

20:15.060 --> 20:16.860
It's relatively warm.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.200
They've been there for a little while.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.860
It's a 30-rack.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.140
It's about half consumed,

20:21.140 --> 20:23.640
so there's about 15 warm cans left,

20:23.640 --> 20:25.620
and it gives that distinct,

20:25.620 --> 20:28.980
almost gasoline smell as you open it up.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.240
And you walk over towards the kids.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.620
They're averaging five units of alcohol per person,

20:35.620 --> 20:37.780
depending on how long they've been out here.

20:37.780 --> 20:38.620
Okay, Joe?

20:38.620 --> 20:40.420
Yeah, and it's ice beer,

20:40.420 --> 20:41.740
which means it's a little bit higher

20:41.740 --> 20:43.540
than your normal three-two.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.360
That's right.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.120
Going with some loose sluices.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.880
Guys, I'm actually,

20:47.880 --> 20:51.360
this is kind of my realm,

20:51.360 --> 20:52.440
ATF, you know?

20:52.440 --> 20:53.800
Oh, that's right, that's right.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.680
And he sniffs his beer.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.680
This is a good one.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.380
I know that is your realm.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.760
I don't want to tell you how to do your job,

21:02.760 --> 21:03.760
but it would be super cool

21:03.760 --> 21:04.960
if you just walked over there

21:04.960 --> 21:06.640
and poured it out in front of him.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.640
No, he savors the beautiful taste of-

21:12.020 --> 21:13.480
The beast ice.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.760
Of the ice.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.120
Hey, kids.

21:17.120 --> 21:17.960
Hey.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.920
This isn't super weird to you

21:19.920 --> 21:21.960
that we're just here.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.560
Well, it's the cool place to be.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.760
We got some questions for you.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.040
Who are you?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.080
Hold on, these guys are clearly nerds.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.000
Mine is-

21:31.000 --> 21:33.420
Yeah, why are there four random adults here

21:33.420 --> 21:36.720
at the reservoir at midnight on a thirsty Thursday?

21:36.720 --> 21:38.480
Well, so, you know,

21:38.480 --> 21:40.240
we haven't been out to the reservoir

21:40.240 --> 21:42.920
for a thirsty Thursday in quite a while.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.760
We figured we'd come down here

21:44.760 --> 21:47.200
and we just ran into you guys.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.840
You don't look like you're from around here.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.680
Well, we are.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.260
We're older than you, you know?

21:52.260 --> 21:53.160
Do you know any- Are you sure?

21:53.160 --> 21:55.320
Have any of your friends disappeared?

21:55.320 --> 21:56.840
Maybe.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.480
I guess they haven't been around.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.320
Maybe.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.160
Yeah, maybe.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.320
What do you mean, maybe?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.640
I mean, it doesn't mean they've disappeared

22:03.640 --> 22:04.880
just because they're not around.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.600
But some of your friends aren't around.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.280
I don't know.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.880
I'm only 12.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.640
It's dark, we should have clocked that right away.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.480
Is this kid actually only 12?

22:17.480 --> 22:19.220
Give me alertness.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.000
I pass, 42 on a 50.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.040
I fail, 71 on a 70.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.080
Jodine's like, what kid?

22:27.080 --> 22:29.120
Which kid are we talking about?

22:29.120 --> 22:31.600
I fail as well, 61 on a 60.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.120
But only Cindy notices that these children,

22:34.120 --> 22:36.760
sorry, these individuals might be children.

22:36.760 --> 22:37.920
The rest of you are like,

22:37.920 --> 22:39.480
yeah, they're probably adults.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.200
It's fine.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.800
You know Harlan, Tan doesn't know it yet.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.040
But that alcohol, brushing through his system

22:46.040 --> 22:49.640
is changing who he is as a person and making him worse.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.800
You think he's a liability now?

22:53.800 --> 22:54.640
Immediately.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.760
Tan is standing there hearing you.

22:56.760 --> 22:57.720
He is ATF.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.920
It's called research.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.400
He probably does know about alcohol.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.560
I'm doing research.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.240
I don't think you should be drinking right now.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.000
I think you should pour that beer out like a hard ass.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.940
He continues to take a sip and then says,

23:08.940 --> 23:11.340
Jane Allen, what's that mean to you?

23:11.340 --> 23:12.980
It's better than their faces.

23:12.980 --> 23:16.300
She's an older girl around here.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.580
I don't know.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.580
You seen her in a while?

23:18.580 --> 23:21.780
No, I don't really go to school.

23:21.780 --> 23:24.020
Then what do you do?

23:24.020 --> 23:24.840
Nothing.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.300
Do you remember how you got here?

23:27.300 --> 23:28.220
In a car?

23:28.220 --> 23:29.180
Who drove?

23:29.180 --> 23:30.180
Rocky did.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.100
When was that?

23:33.420 --> 23:35.380
30 minutes ago.

23:35.380 --> 23:38.500
Oh shit, you pounded five fucking ices

23:39.060 --> 23:40.420
in 30 minutes each.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.540
And these kids are 12.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.540
They're like, these kids are just on the ground.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.380
Like one of them is already dead.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.660
The one with the beard walks over.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.100
Why are you bothering my friends?

23:57.660 --> 23:58.860
Are you Rocky?

23:58.860 --> 23:59.700
Yes.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.940
Did you guys drink all of these beers in the last 30 minutes?

24:02.940 --> 24:03.780
No.

24:03.780 --> 24:04.600
No?

24:04.600 --> 24:06.300
No, I'm the designated driver.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.360
I would never.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.920
They had seven and a half each.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.040
Rocky, you know, it just doesn't look like

24:16.040 --> 24:17.320
these kids have the body weight

24:17.320 --> 24:19.880
for seven and a half Milwaukee's best ices.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.920
They seem fine to me.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.020
They're passing.

24:23.020 --> 24:23.860
You're right.

24:23.860 --> 24:27.320
They do seem rather coherent for what they've ingested.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.220
Rocky, what do you know about aliens?

24:34.900 --> 24:37.040
As he's frustratedly answering,

24:37.600 --> 24:39.800
I grab his arm and look at it.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.720
Oh my God.

24:40.720 --> 24:41.840
Roll me a search.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.360
Guys, I really don't think anyone who is around

24:45.360 --> 24:47.720
is gonna have these little cuts.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.480
Yeah, remember that came with some pretty telltale symptoms.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.560
Yeah, I successfully passed.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.640
Yeah, you don't see any.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.560
The two younger kids, not Rocky,

25:01.560 --> 25:04.440
does look like they've pounded seven and a half beers each.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.840
However, there seemed to be no effects on them at all.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.680
Well, that's odd.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.640
Ooh.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, that's what I was talking, yeah.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.400
That's fucking nuts.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.600
All right, let's get the fuck out of here

25:14.600 --> 25:15.760
and go on to the next place.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.520
Could we, hey, could we get your names real quick?

25:17.520 --> 25:19.800
I'm Rocky Collins.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.400
The younger gentleman you were talking to over there,

25:22.400 --> 25:24.520
Chester Wisman.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.220
I bet you have a lot of fun with that name, huh?

25:26.220 --> 25:30.000
Lastly, the woman over there, young lady over there,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.760
Chastity James.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.380
How old are you, Mr. Collins?

25:37.120 --> 25:40.040
I'm 23.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.840
Can we roll human on that?

25:41.840 --> 25:42.680
Yeah.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.520
Yes.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.880
I pass. I pass a 60 on a 60.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.080
I pass with a two.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.420
39 on a 40.

25:50.420 --> 25:51.260
Harlan fails.

25:51.260 --> 25:56.000
He might be lying and is only 20 and he is just worried.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.280
He just seems to be shifty

25:57.280 --> 25:59.520
because he realizes you're adults and...

25:59.520 --> 26:02.080
Kid, we don't really care how, you know,

26:02.080 --> 26:03.320
that you're underage drinking.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.480
It's not like we didn't do any of that ourselves,

26:05.520 --> 26:08.000
but we just need to know the actual facts.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.240
Like, how old are you, son?

26:09.240 --> 26:12.680
I am legally obliged to arrest you,

26:12.680 --> 26:15.560
but if you help us, I won't.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.720
ATF agent, alcohol, tobacco, firearms.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.780
It's just a relief.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.040
I don't have to do that deep voice anymore now.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.800
I'm most concerned at this point

26:27.800 --> 26:30.580
that these are actually adults

26:30.580 --> 26:34.640
that are now have taken over these 12 year old bodies

26:34.640 --> 26:36.400
based on the way that he said that-

26:36.400 --> 26:37.440
They just pound in those ices?

26:37.440 --> 26:42.200
A, pounding ices, number one, and B, two.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.500
He said that woman over there,

26:44.500 --> 26:47.380
and then was like, I mean that girl, right?

26:47.380 --> 26:48.220
So I think-

26:48.220 --> 26:51.080
It's almost like our DM is like respectful and chill.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.760
No, that was just bad game.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.960
That was bad handling though.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.360
I just, I caught myself.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.680
Don't read into that.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.520
Sorry.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.760
I thought I cracked the whole thing open.

27:00.760 --> 27:01.600
Nope.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.880
So, Mr., what was it again?

27:04.880 --> 27:05.840
Rocky Collins.

27:05.840 --> 27:06.660
Mr. Collins.

27:06.660 --> 27:07.500
Rocky Collins.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.320
Mr. Collins.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.160
Yeah.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.320
So, do you know Jane Allen?

27:11.320 --> 27:12.440
No, I don't.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.960
We're a couple years apart.

27:13.960 --> 27:17.160
You make it sound like she's not around, that's sure a shame.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.200
And you don't have any friends

27:19.200 --> 27:22.480
that just haven't been around for like three weeks?

27:22.480 --> 27:23.720
Not three weeks, no.

27:23.720 --> 27:24.560
Two weeks?

27:24.560 --> 27:25.380
Any amount of time.

27:25.380 --> 27:26.220
One week?

27:26.220 --> 27:27.060
Any amount.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.280
Occasionally people go places.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.120
Where do they go?

27:29.120 --> 27:30.200
They go to the big city.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.640
They go to the big city.

27:31.640 --> 27:32.920
What do they do in the city?

27:32.920 --> 27:35.400
They go to the big city shopping.

27:35.400 --> 27:36.300
Shopping.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.140
That checks out.

27:37.140 --> 27:40.120
And they're gone for days, weeks at a time?

27:40.120 --> 27:42.400
Oh, sometimes there's some big shopping to do in the city.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.280
You gotta get your fancy clothes at the Gap

27:45.280 --> 27:47.660
and, you know, back to town.

27:47.660 --> 27:51.500
Rocky, has anybody you know ever not come back to town?

27:51.500 --> 27:52.720
Not as far as I know.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.720
And you were 20, that was correct?

27:54.720 --> 27:55.560
Ish.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.600
And how old are your associates here?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.980
Mid teens.

27:58.980 --> 28:02.500
Cindy walks back and gets in the DEA car.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.940
Do you want to breathalyze the kids

28:03.940 --> 28:05.940
or anything else while you're there?

28:05.940 --> 28:07.540
Do you want to sobriety check them?

28:07.540 --> 28:08.900
Yeah, let's send them back to Delta Green

28:08.900 --> 28:10.100
for testing in there.

28:11.860 --> 28:13.160
All right, you hop back in the car?

28:13.160 --> 28:14.000
Where to?

28:14.000 --> 28:14.820
Murrell's.

28:14.820 --> 28:15.940
1 a.m., night one.

28:15.940 --> 28:16.780
Murrell's?

28:16.780 --> 28:18.980
Wait, the hotel or the bar?

28:18.980 --> 28:19.820
I think the bar.

28:19.820 --> 28:21.580
The bar, county bunker.

28:21.580 --> 28:22.420
Oh.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.620
The late night, Harlan, you gonna stay up?

28:24.620 --> 28:27.180
What are we going to the bar for?

28:27.180 --> 28:30.260
We're gonna have the same conversation we just had

28:30.260 --> 28:33.380
but with older people at a bar.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.820
Yeah, they gave us the password, so that's cool.

28:40.260 --> 28:44.520
As David is just nodding thoroughly and vigorously,

28:45.860 --> 28:48.660
Cindy falls asleep in the car as you guys are going.

28:49.660 --> 28:52.340
Okay, what if we just leave her in here?

28:52.580 --> 28:57.580
She got real calm earlier.

28:58.020 --> 29:01.340
Again, this is a brilliant investigative mind

29:01.340 --> 29:03.660
but her methods are pretty unorthodox

29:03.660 --> 29:07.720
and I've seen her get like this before it really gets odd.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.560
Tan rings a doorbell on the bar at the bar.

29:12.700 --> 29:13.720
Waking Cindy up.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.660
And you go to the door.

29:18.660 --> 29:21.260
Murrell's county bunker is literally stylized

29:21.260 --> 29:23.500
almost as if it's some sort of bunker.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.500
It's a windowless bar, blocky.

29:26.500 --> 29:31.260
The front door is almost like it's for a gang hideout.

29:31.260 --> 29:33.980
It is a heavy door with like one of those slots,

29:33.980 --> 29:34.820
like an eye slot.

29:34.820 --> 29:35.660
Ooh, nice.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.060
Cop knock, ring, ring.

29:41.660 --> 29:43.240
There's a little doorbell on it.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.420
Big League Chew.

29:44.420 --> 29:47.020
Door slides open, he sees you,

29:47.020 --> 29:51.060
Big League Chew closes it, door cracks open, you walk in.

29:51.700 --> 29:54.540
It is a half, not liquor store,

29:54.540 --> 29:57.860
but more of like a grab and go beer place and half bar.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.460
Again, there's no windows, it's dark.

30:00.460 --> 30:04.580
It's stylized with those tin branded beer signs

30:04.580 --> 30:07.140
all over the place of every which brand.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.540
Some of these brands are even now defunct

30:09.540 --> 30:12.300
in the early 90s, some of them are more modern.

30:12.300 --> 30:15.500
The place smells like that solvent

30:15.500 --> 30:18.460
that a really cheap bar has that just permeates the air

30:18.460 --> 30:19.980
and that's all you can smell.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.820
You can't smell food, you can't smell the beer,

30:22.820 --> 30:26.260
it's just that kind of ambient solvent smell everywhere.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.700
And there's only the bartender,

30:27.700 --> 30:29.260
there's no one else in there right now.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.280
Can you roll for some of those signs?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.700
Oh yeah.

30:34.340 --> 30:35.700
Steel Reserve.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.220
Oh look, good one.

30:37.220 --> 30:38.060
Steel Reserve.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.260
Oh, Rolling Rock, that's fancy.

30:41.260 --> 30:43.620
Oh, from the glass line tanks of old Latrobe.

30:43.620 --> 30:46.060
That's what they called me in high school.

30:46.060 --> 30:47.600
They called you Rolling Rock?

30:47.600 --> 30:48.440
That's right.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.240
They called me Super Dork.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.280
And lastly, Steel Reserve.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.980
Oh, another Steel Reserve.

30:56.980 --> 30:57.820
This one's a little fancier.

30:57.820 --> 30:58.660
I like this one.

30:58.660 --> 31:00.080
Yeah, it's a limited table.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.480
It's only a D12 table.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.480
All right, bartender behind the bar

31:04.480 --> 31:06.760
says, well, hello there.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.840
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

31:14.840 --> 31:17.840
Every single time.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.040
Why is it always the aliens?

31:20.040 --> 31:21.360
Oh, sorry, we didn't know this town

31:21.360 --> 31:22.720
had any kind of connection to that.

31:22.720 --> 31:25.180
That's just kind of his new age pickup line

31:25.180 --> 31:26.200
that he's been dropping out.

31:26.200 --> 31:30.080
It sounds like you're really upset by this.

31:30.080 --> 31:33.520
So how many times have you been abducted by aliens?

31:35.520 --> 31:38.360
Me and my partner saw you from across the bar

31:38.360 --> 31:42.520
and we thought that you were.

31:42.520 --> 31:46.120
We're just the laughing stock, laughing stock of Tennessee.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.440
Yes, we're all laughing.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.360
I hate it.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.200
Pointing and laughing.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.840
I hate being the laughing stock of Tennessee.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.680
Who hates it?

31:54.680 --> 31:55.500
What's your name?

31:55.500 --> 31:58.680
My name is Arthur Doyle.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.600
Arthur C. Doyle?

31:59.600 --> 32:00.480
Just Doyle.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.600
But really, though, how many times?

32:02.600 --> 32:03.520
Never.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.600
People always ask that.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.480
There ain't no abductions around her.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.960
You don't know anybody that's been abducted or?

32:08.960 --> 32:09.800
No.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.240
Abducted from their Sherlock Holmes, maybe?

32:12.240 --> 32:15.420
No, ain't nobody been abducted around here.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.160
We have some Moriarty questions.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.560
Okay.

32:23.640 --> 32:24.480
Jesus Christ.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.800
You Sherlock harassing the locals, I've noticed.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.720
People have been talking about these agents

32:32.720 --> 32:37.720
going around town, asking questions about the aliens.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.240
And that upsets people?

32:39.240 --> 32:40.560
Yes, sir.

32:40.560 --> 32:44.400
Is it because you like these aliens and you don't want to?

32:44.400 --> 32:45.680
No!

32:45.680 --> 32:47.040
We don't like no aliens.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.440
We just want to live in peace.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.640
So you don't want the aliens to be here anymore?

32:50.640 --> 32:51.840
What aliens?

32:51.840 --> 32:52.960
The ones you don't want here.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.200
What are you talking about?

32:54.200 --> 32:56.140
What are you talking about?

32:56.140 --> 33:00.240
Why do you just keep asking questions about aliens?

33:00.240 --> 33:01.180
You tell us.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.180
Hey!

33:03.180 --> 33:04.900
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.880
Sorry to bring up the aliens.

33:06.880 --> 33:07.840
Can I have a water?

33:07.840 --> 33:09.720
Do you know who killed Jane Allen?

33:09.720 --> 33:10.560
Yes.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.120
You do know who killed Jane Allen.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.080
He pours each of you a water

33:16.080 --> 33:17.960
because the nice old lady asked for one

33:17.960 --> 33:19.920
and you've been out all day.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.100
I chug it.

33:21.100 --> 33:21.940
You chug it?

33:21.940 --> 33:22.760
Okay.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.200
And I've still got my Milwaukee's Best ice

33:25.200 --> 33:26.440
from the reservoir.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.400
Hey, hey!

33:27.400 --> 33:29.760
No outside beverages.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.400
No outside beverages.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.740
You gotta shop parrot.

33:32.740 --> 33:35.600
Tan chugs it and then goes back to his line of questioning.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.600
Who gives you the right to do that?

33:37.600 --> 33:41.600
So did you kill Jane Allen or who did it?

33:41.600 --> 33:46.440
Why are you accusing me of killing Jane Allen?

33:46.440 --> 33:50.240
Well, so it sounds like somebody did kill her then, right?

33:50.240 --> 33:51.060
Based off what you just said.

33:51.060 --> 33:51.900
I don't know.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.600
I didn't say that.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.640
That's what I heard.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.800
We just tried this with him and he did not crack.

33:57.800 --> 34:01.440
So let me guess, nothing is happening

34:01.440 --> 34:03.940
that is strange or unusual in this town.

34:03.940 --> 34:04.780
Correct.

34:04.780 --> 34:05.600
Everything is fine.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.440
Yeah.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.800
Any of your friends been out of town for a while?

34:08.800 --> 34:09.640
No.

34:09.640 --> 34:10.560
Oh good, any of your friends?

34:10.560 --> 34:11.920
Got no friends.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.220
I work hard.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.100
I'm always here at the county bunker.

34:15.100 --> 34:19.440
You don't make friends with any of the regulars?

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
No, they're my customers.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.280
I get that.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.100
You gotta keep that distance.

34:22.100 --> 34:27.100
Are you aware of a Billy Ray Spivvy, Spivvy?

34:27.480 --> 34:28.320
Yeah, that boy.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.300
Has he been in here?

34:29.300 --> 34:31.080
Does he frequent this establishment?

34:31.080 --> 34:32.080
No, sir.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.080
I check IDs.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.380
Thank you very much.

34:35.380 --> 34:37.340
I see that guy over there with the ATF badge

34:37.340 --> 34:38.840
trying to trip me up.

34:38.840 --> 34:39.680
No, sir.

34:39.680 --> 34:41.240
No children in this bar.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.280
Can I humint that?

34:42.280 --> 34:43.120
Sure.

34:46.000 --> 34:46.840
Fail.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.600
93 on a 60.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.800
Everyone in the bar looks 12 now.

34:52.240 --> 34:56.040
Does Scott Adams come in here much?

34:56.040 --> 34:58.480
Oh, oh, that guy.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.300
Yeah.

34:59.300 --> 35:01.560
He's poking around just like you,

35:01.560 --> 35:03.800
asking about them UFOs.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.720
Told him he wasn't allowed to come back here.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.720
Is that, oh, you kicked him out.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.440
He was harassing my customers.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.720
Was his line of inquiry similar to ours,

35:11.720 --> 35:13.720
or was he asking different things?

35:13.720 --> 35:15.600
Basically the same stuff.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.320
This is just a person.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.760
Do you think it was the fella from Dilbert?

35:18.760 --> 35:21.560
I ain't seen him making no comics while he was here,

35:21.560 --> 35:22.800
if that's what you're asking.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.480
What have you seen him doing while he's here?

35:24.480 --> 35:27.120
Harassing my customers.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.640
Asked and answered, fair enough.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.520
Thank you very much for your time.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.380
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.220
That is what?

35:33.220 --> 35:35.400
You have thoroughly wasted enough time,

35:35.400 --> 35:36.560
and now this bar has to close.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.840
Thank you, Z.

35:37.840 --> 35:39.560
Ushers you out the front door.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.860
Are we like right next to the motel?

35:41.860 --> 35:42.880
You're very close, yeah.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.340
Both are on the outskirts of town.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.700
They're both owned by Murrells.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.400
They're conveniently close enough

35:47.400 --> 35:50.460
that you could walk from the county bunker to the motel.

35:50.460 --> 35:52.920
And what time is it, like one in the morning right now?

35:52.920 --> 35:53.740
Two.

35:53.740 --> 35:54.580
Bar closed at two.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.420
Yep.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.440
Do you think it's too late to go try to talk to him?

35:57.440 --> 35:58.480
I'm so tired.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.860
I'm tempted to turn in myself

36:00.860 --> 36:03.040
and get this with fresh eyes.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.980
I've gotta sleep and shit and piss,

36:05.820 --> 36:07.720
and eat, apparently.

36:08.980 --> 36:10.280
Do we each have our own room

36:10.280 --> 36:12.060
or are we all staying in the same room?

36:12.060 --> 36:13.380
Are you gonna check in?

36:13.380 --> 36:14.420
Yeah, let's go check in.

36:14.420 --> 36:15.260
Yeah.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.420
So you walk over to the hotel,

36:16.420 --> 36:18.860
you go to talk to Riker Yates.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.900
However, there's a sign up saying,

36:20.900 --> 36:24.260
the manager is not on duty, please check in at 10 a.m.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.700
You get to sleep in your cars now

36:26.700 --> 36:29.220
because you didn't even bother to check into the motel.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.820
I think Harlan saw the sign

36:30.820 --> 36:32.980
and was already walking back to the Bronco.

36:35.180 --> 36:38.460
Wait, do we know which hotel room?

36:38.460 --> 36:39.460
No, we haven't checked in.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.900
No, no, Scott.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.620
Oh, that Scott was in.

36:42.620 --> 36:43.780
We do?

36:43.780 --> 36:45.220
No, we didn't get room numbers.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.860
No, you didn't get the number out of them.

36:46.860 --> 36:50.340
Can I do a search for a book that has customers?

36:50.340 --> 36:52.240
So you're gonna break into the...

36:52.240 --> 36:53.820
We're still on the outside.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.140
We haven't made it into the lobby.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.420
Oh, we're not inside the lobby?

36:56.420 --> 36:57.260
No.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.420
There's no lobby, so this is, I should say,

36:59.420 --> 37:02.540
standard motel, doors open outward,

37:02.540 --> 37:04.220
and it's actually, you know what,

37:04.300 --> 37:05.220
I'm just gonna give you a map.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.060
How about that?

37:06.060 --> 37:07.500
Ooh. Perfect.

37:07.500 --> 37:11.860
So, 11 room motel, L-shaped.

37:11.860 --> 37:15.780
The rooms on one side of the L are kind of double units,

37:15.780 --> 37:18.060
two double beds plus kitchenettes.

37:18.060 --> 37:20.100
And then there's this, on the other side of the L,

37:20.100 --> 37:22.940
it's just standard rooms where it's some beds

37:22.940 --> 37:25.580
and then a bathroom, and that's pretty much it.

37:25.580 --> 37:27.860
And then in between, in like the joint of the L,

37:27.860 --> 37:29.300
there's a manager's office.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.300
Right, is that locked?

37:31.300 --> 37:33.180
The office is locked, so it has that sign

37:33.180 --> 37:34.700
saying basically, come back tomorrow.

37:34.700 --> 37:35.540
Yeah.

37:35.540 --> 37:38.180
I'm not gonna sleep in the car.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.800
I don't know if Scott's a nice guy or not,

37:39.800 --> 37:41.620
but I'm gonna go find him.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.060
No, you're not.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.580
I would not advise just knocking on doors

37:45.580 --> 37:46.420
at two in the morning.

37:46.420 --> 37:48.060
Hold on, real quick, who's in charge of this?

37:48.060 --> 37:49.200
Oh, yeah.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.440
Sorry, guys, you're not actually full Delta Green.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.940
Oh, yeah, we're in charge of this task force.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.380
You're the friendlies, we're the agents.

37:56.380 --> 37:58.260
You're gonna sleep in your car tonight.

37:58.260 --> 37:59.080
That's fine with me.

37:59.080 --> 38:01.100
It's actually something I do pretty often

38:01.100 --> 38:02.340
in my line of work.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.140
Aw, that's sad.

38:04.140 --> 38:07.260
It's not, it's just, we stake out places.

38:07.260 --> 38:08.940
We have to make sure that we see the comings

38:08.940 --> 38:10.420
and goings of people pretty often.

38:10.420 --> 38:11.620
It's not sad they have steak.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.980
I guess I'll do it.

38:12.980 --> 38:14.780
Typically, when I sleep in my car,

38:14.780 --> 38:17.620
it's cause it's like outside of the casino.

38:17.620 --> 38:20.500
I had a bad night, so it's kinda not a great feeling

38:20.500 --> 38:21.700
for me, but I guess I'll do it.

38:21.700 --> 38:22.660
Well, you'll have a friend.

38:22.660 --> 38:24.980
It's not a great feeling for anybody, bud,

38:24.980 --> 38:27.540
but we're gonna be doing that for the next,

38:27.540 --> 38:29.860
probably till like 6 a.m., it's only like four hours.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.620
Yeah, he goes back to the Bronco.

38:31.620 --> 38:34.420
Are you talking outside about all of this,

38:34.420 --> 38:36.040
like standing outside of the office?

38:36.040 --> 38:37.140
Defo, yep.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.740
Okay, so as you're doing that,

38:38.740 --> 38:40.860
eventually towards the end of the conversation,

38:40.860 --> 38:42.940
the lights turn on on the inside.

38:42.940 --> 38:44.660
The manager's apartment was back there,

38:44.660 --> 38:47.300
so Riker actually lives inside the hotel,

38:47.300 --> 38:50.220
and he overheard you talking loudly.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.360
It's still September, he had his window open,

38:52.360 --> 38:54.520
and eventually all the bickering about cars

38:54.520 --> 38:56.600
and sleeping in the car and stuff woke him up.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.980
So he comes out in his pajamas,

38:58.980 --> 39:03.100
like a nice proper two-piece striped pajama suit,

39:03.100 --> 39:05.860
a very handsome gentleman comes to the door,

39:05.860 --> 39:08.180
all bleary-eyed.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.920
Let me guess, let me guess,

39:10.920 --> 39:13.100
you're those agents or whatever that call the hat, right?

39:13.100 --> 39:15.740
DEA Task Force, yep, investigating Superman.

39:15.740 --> 39:17.500
We're awfully sorry, sir.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.940
Come on, come on, come in, come in, come in.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.660
We appreciate you getting up out of bed for us.

39:22.660 --> 39:23.660
Your nation thanks you.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.360
Ah, I already, here, paperwork,

39:25.360 --> 39:27.580
what, I just, I wanna go back to bed.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.500
Just give us the keys, and we'll do it all tomorrow.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.340
How about that?

39:31.340 --> 39:33.840
All right, we got you in,

39:33.840 --> 39:36.180
we got four different double bedrooms.

39:36.180 --> 39:37.020
Perfect.

39:37.020 --> 39:39.820
Yeah, you're in rooms six to nine.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.500
I don't know why that's funny, but it got me.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.820
I'll take the six.

39:48.820 --> 39:49.860
I'll take the nine.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.740
Seven's my lucky number, so.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.540
I get the set leaves me with eight.

39:53.540 --> 39:56.700
Oh, infinity on its side, like that man's tattoo.

39:56.740 --> 39:58.180
Maybe it's lucky.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.580
Does everyone go to bed?

40:06.620 --> 40:10.060
Before we get to the rooms, I do wanna ask Riker

40:11.660 --> 40:12.660
just a bunch of questions.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.260
No, I just don't wanna ask him what rooms

40:14.260 --> 40:15.660
Scott Adams is staying in.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.260
Which rooms are the aliens in?

40:19.260 --> 40:20.100
Yep.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.820
Thank you for showing us to these rooms, Mr. Riker.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.700
Now, we understand you have a guest here

40:24.700 --> 40:26.820
staying with you, a Mr. Scott Adams.

40:26.820 --> 40:29.020
How, how do you know that?

40:29.020 --> 40:30.340
We heard from in town.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.900
We're investigators, this is part of our investigation.

40:32.900 --> 40:33.740
Oh.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.620
Into super myth?

40:34.620 --> 40:36.220
We're figuring it out, it'll be okay.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.060
Super myth.

40:37.060 --> 40:37.900
It'll be all right.

40:37.900 --> 40:38.720
We just need to ask him some questions.

40:38.720 --> 40:39.560
Just let us know which room he's in.

40:39.560 --> 40:41.100
Your hotel is not in danger.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.660
Room 10, you rented 10 and 11.

40:43.660 --> 40:44.780
10 and 11?

40:44.780 --> 40:45.620
Mm-hmm.

40:45.620 --> 40:46.440
Okay.

40:46.440 --> 40:48.940
Thank you so much for, I'm sorry to wake you up,

40:48.940 --> 40:52.220
but I was not looking forward to sleeping in that car,

40:52.220 --> 40:53.180
so thank you.

40:53.180 --> 40:54.460
It's fine.

40:54.460 --> 40:55.780
It's fine.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.660
He turns around, goes back in, lights off.

40:58.660 --> 41:02.860
Tan goes, goes to bed, he plays a little online poker.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.100
No, he doesn't.

41:04.100 --> 41:04.940
Yeah.

41:06.940 --> 41:08.540
Thomas, get it through your head.

41:08.540 --> 41:12.300
We don't know what existed in the 90s.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.140
I know you're 17, but.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.580
Oh, you're right, he doesn't.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.340
He plays one of those little handheld machines.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.180
Oh, yes.

41:18.180 --> 41:20.140
It's like a double A battery.

41:20.140 --> 41:20.980
Yeah.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.900
Every time you like hit something that's at least

41:24.620 --> 41:27.100
what, at least three of a kind or whatever,

41:27.100 --> 41:29.500
it plays that we're in the money tune.

41:29.500 --> 41:32.020
Yeah, monophonic.

41:32.020 --> 41:32.940
Yeah.

41:32.940 --> 41:36.260
He does that until he loses five times in a row,

41:36.260 --> 41:39.380
and then Zs.

41:39.380 --> 41:41.620
Anyone else doing anything before bed?

41:41.620 --> 41:43.260
Taking a shower, doing anything else?

41:43.260 --> 41:47.180
Harlan, he would flop on the bed fully clothed.

41:47.180 --> 41:48.020
Okay.

41:48.020 --> 41:52.340
Cindy puts away all of her clothes in each of the drawers

41:52.340 --> 41:56.860
in the motel room and then goes and sets up her toiletries

41:56.860 --> 42:01.540
at the bathroom sink and does her good night face wash,

42:01.540 --> 42:05.100
puts on a face mask and then heads to bed

42:05.100 --> 42:07.380
and has a full blown nightmare.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.860
Joe slash Thomas, any special plans?

42:10.860 --> 42:14.100
Yeah, Joe walks outside of his room and smokes a cigarette

42:14.100 --> 42:16.900
and he wants to take a look at the outside

42:16.900 --> 42:18.340
of rooms 10 and 11.

42:18.340 --> 42:21.780
What is your alertness skill?

42:21.780 --> 42:22.700
70.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.820
Okay, well, all right.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.940
Well, with a 70, you don't even have to roll.

42:25.940 --> 42:28.380
The one thing you notice between the two rooms,

42:28.380 --> 42:30.860
the room that was identified as Scott Adams' room,

42:30.860 --> 42:33.780
so that's room 10, there's a little bit of cloth

42:33.780 --> 42:36.260
sticking out from under the door.

42:36.260 --> 42:39.460
It looks like a towel, like a standard hotel towel

42:39.460 --> 42:41.220
kind of peeking out from underneath the door.

42:41.220 --> 42:42.700
It's getting blazed in there, dude.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.500
Like somebody had rolled one up under the door.

42:44.500 --> 42:46.980
Yeah, and other than that, you also notice

42:46.980 --> 42:49.100
the blinds are closed, but you can kind of see

42:49.140 --> 42:52.220
through the blinds, nothing on the other side.

42:52.220 --> 42:55.100
It's dark, almost as if there was a blanket put up

42:55.100 --> 42:58.580
over the top of the closed blinds.

42:58.580 --> 43:00.780
If I put my ear up to the door,

43:00.780 --> 43:03.620
do I hear any sounds or activities, movements?

43:03.620 --> 43:06.180
I'm not even gonna make you roll, you hear nothing.

43:06.180 --> 43:07.060
Okay.

43:07.060 --> 43:09.700
He uses the bathroom, takes a shower and goes to bed.

43:09.700 --> 43:10.540
Okay.

43:11.660 --> 43:12.860
Everyone sleeps through the night.

43:12.860 --> 43:15.340
You wake up, reasonable hour.

43:15.340 --> 43:17.940
You notice the office is back open up front.

43:17.940 --> 43:19.500
The lights are on again.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.020
There's a little bit of movement.

43:21.020 --> 43:22.500
However, there's not that many other cars

43:22.500 --> 43:23.340
in the parking lot.

43:23.340 --> 43:27.620
There's one van, your Bronco, your Crown Vic,

43:27.620 --> 43:29.940
and then another rental car.

43:29.940 --> 43:32.860
It looks to be a Ford Escort.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.580
Are either of those parked in front of 10 or 11?

43:35.580 --> 43:36.740
The Escort is.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.820
The van's towards the other side

43:38.820 --> 43:41.060
where the other rooms are on the other half of the aisle.

43:41.060 --> 43:42.500
And you said we could tell it was a rental?

43:42.500 --> 43:45.060
Escort is definitely a rental.

43:45.060 --> 43:46.740
It's unclear of the other one.

43:46.740 --> 43:50.860
When Tan wakes up, he goes into the office and asks,

43:50.860 --> 43:54.300
do you have any coffee or food

43:54.300 --> 43:58.460
or where should I go for that kind of stuff?

43:58.460 --> 44:03.180
I'd recommend the Mega Deuce if you want a big meal.

44:03.180 --> 44:07.220
But if you want a small meal, I got some coffee over here.

44:07.220 --> 44:08.740
You know, your offices are the law.

44:08.740 --> 44:10.860
I can cut you in on some donuts.

44:10.860 --> 44:13.060
I appreciate that, but I'm a little hungry.

44:13.580 --> 44:17.940
Tan leaves the office and knocks on your respective doors.

44:17.940 --> 44:20.780
Hey, you guys wanna go to the Deuce to get some breakfast?

44:20.780 --> 44:22.900
And maybe we can ask Scott to come with us.

44:22.900 --> 44:26.660
You hear a scream when you knock on room number six.

44:26.660 --> 44:28.380
And she's just like, ah!

44:28.380 --> 44:30.700
I try to open the door and get in.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.420
Cracks the door and she's like, sorry.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.660
And she is drenched in sweat.

44:34.660 --> 44:36.820
I mean, just like she jumped into a pool.

44:36.820 --> 44:38.140
And she's like, let me shower.

44:38.140 --> 44:39.100
I'll be right out.

44:39.100 --> 44:40.660
I'm sorry, Miss Woodabaga.

44:40.660 --> 44:41.500
Take a shower.

44:41.540 --> 44:44.460
I think maybe we could take Scott to breakfast.

44:44.460 --> 44:45.700
I think that's a great idea.

44:45.700 --> 44:46.740
Do you wake up Cindy?

44:46.740 --> 44:48.540
You wake up the other two as well?

44:48.540 --> 44:50.300
Yeah, I knock on their doors as well.

44:50.300 --> 44:52.900
Harlan just splashes some water under his pits

44:52.900 --> 44:57.020
and puts on a new black polo from his suitcase.

44:57.020 --> 44:58.940
That's the only difference.

44:58.940 --> 45:02.740
Tan did not really plan for an overnight stay,

45:02.740 --> 45:05.020
even though he totally knew that it was happening.

45:05.020 --> 45:08.620
So he's still wearing the baby blue polo shirt

45:08.620 --> 45:10.980
that the neck has been stretched out.

45:10.980 --> 45:14.260
But he's happy and he's stoked to go eat breakfast.

45:14.260 --> 45:16.580
Jodine is wearing a fresh white polo.

45:16.580 --> 45:20.980
He nods approvingly at Harlan's sharp, fresh black polo.

45:20.980 --> 45:24.340
And he puts on some sunglasses and says,

45:24.340 --> 45:26.340
yeah, let's get some grip.

45:26.340 --> 45:30.540
When Cindy comes out, the four of us stand at door 10.

45:32.140 --> 45:34.060
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

45:35.660 --> 45:37.580
No doorbells, unfortunately.

45:37.580 --> 45:39.980
Old fashioned knocking, no answer.

45:40.020 --> 45:43.100
We go to 11 and do the same thing.

45:43.100 --> 45:46.540
You go to 11 and knock and no answer.

45:48.020 --> 45:51.660
Scott, Scott, Scott.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.940
Mr. Adams.

45:54.940 --> 45:55.780
Nothing.

45:55.780 --> 46:00.140
So while you're shouting, the manager hears you.

46:00.140 --> 46:02.860
Riker peeks his head out, looks at you,

46:02.860 --> 46:05.140
realizes kind of what's going on,

46:05.140 --> 46:06.900
goes back behind the counter,

46:06.900 --> 46:09.000
grabs some keys and comes out to you.

46:10.260 --> 46:12.380
You're looking for Scott, you said?

46:12.380 --> 46:13.420
For Mr. Adams, yeah.

46:13.420 --> 46:16.020
Yeah, can you open his door up?

46:16.020 --> 46:16.940
Do you have a warrant?

46:16.940 --> 46:17.780
Do you have a warrant?

46:17.780 --> 46:20.220
Well, this is more of a safety check.

46:20.220 --> 46:22.500
Yeah, we believe he might be in some danger.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.420
Danger from what?

46:23.420 --> 46:25.580
Well, I think he might've fallen in his bathroom

46:25.580 --> 46:27.700
or something, but I heard a big clunk

46:27.700 --> 46:29.460
and it sounds like we need to get in there pretty quick.

46:29.460 --> 46:32.100
Yeah, you wouldn't want anyone to die in your motel,

46:32.100 --> 46:32.940
would you?

46:32.940 --> 46:35.900
No, no, no, no, that'd be really bad for business.

46:35.900 --> 46:37.580
It sounded bad, it sounded nasty.

46:37.580 --> 46:39.460
Goes in, unlocks the door and says,

46:39.460 --> 46:41.340
please, please, just go ahead.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.820
He was like, if I live, I'm gonna sue.

46:42.820 --> 46:46.180
We're like all like showing eyes to each other,

46:46.180 --> 46:48.020
like as soon as we get in there,

46:48.020 --> 46:51.160
we search everything as fast as we can.

46:51.160 --> 46:53.540
You open and the second that door cracks open,

46:53.540 --> 46:55.820
you catch a really bad odor.

46:55.820 --> 46:57.300
Yeah, it's that kind of bad odor.

46:57.300 --> 46:58.460
Yeah, okay.

46:58.460 --> 47:00.740
It's very, very dark because of that blanket

47:00.740 --> 47:04.500
that you can see now was duct taped over the window.

47:04.500 --> 47:07.740
Looking around, you see a couple of different things.

47:07.740 --> 47:11.260
You see the blankets that have been pulled off the bed

47:11.260 --> 47:14.300
and used for that, so clearly the bed is unmade.

47:14.300 --> 47:16.540
You see two piles of clothing.

47:16.540 --> 47:18.780
One of them is just kind of thrown in the corner.

47:18.780 --> 47:21.260
The other one is neatly folded on the table.

47:21.260 --> 47:24.680
You also see a Macintosh PowerBook.

47:24.680 --> 47:26.180
Is that like a laptop?

47:26.180 --> 47:27.100
That's a laptop.

47:27.100 --> 47:30.140
That's what laptops looked like in the early 90s.

47:30.140 --> 47:33.020
But you see one of those bad boys plugged into the wall.

47:33.060 --> 47:35.500
You see a series of documents,

47:35.500 --> 47:37.460
junk food containers on the floor,

47:37.460 --> 47:39.240
and that's pretty much all you can see

47:39.240 --> 47:41.180
as you walk into the room.

47:41.180 --> 47:42.780
Cindy failed her search check,

47:42.780 --> 47:45.660
and so with that smell, as soon as it hits her nose,

47:45.660 --> 47:48.020
she's like, nope, nope, not for me.

47:48.020 --> 47:49.260
Can't be around any of that,

47:49.260 --> 47:51.060
and just walks out back outside.

47:51.060 --> 47:53.460
Tan also failed his search role,

47:54.380 --> 47:59.380
and he feels physically sick and joins Cindy.

48:00.380 --> 48:02.060
I pass my search role.

48:02.060 --> 48:03.100
It's a 68.

48:03.100 --> 48:04.740
I passed with a 17.

48:04.740 --> 48:07.780
So Joe Dean and Harlan both pass.

48:08.780 --> 48:10.460
Most of this stuff is very obvious,

48:10.460 --> 48:12.140
kind of what you're seeing.

48:12.140 --> 48:15.620
You do see some journals sitting around

48:15.620 --> 48:18.540
that you didn't initially see on the first pass.

48:18.540 --> 48:21.480
Just those spiral notebooks that kids would use in school,

48:21.480 --> 48:23.420
and scrawled on the front of one of them

48:23.420 --> 48:25.500
is Grover'sville Notebook.

48:25.500 --> 48:28.220
He uses wide-ruled spiral notebook,

48:28.220 --> 48:30.620
which also makes you kind of question his sanity,

48:30.620 --> 48:34.700
why anyone would use the wide-ruled versus college-ruled

48:34.700 --> 48:37.500
as an adult, but you know, it happens.

48:37.500 --> 48:38.760
I also want to be clear.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.460
You've only checked the one bedroom area.

48:42.460 --> 48:45.660
There is still a rotten smell to be discovered.

48:45.660 --> 48:47.760
When Tan leaves the room,

48:47.760 --> 48:50.040
he's like, can't deal with that smell.

48:50.040 --> 48:53.100
Hey, hey, Cindy, maybe we go check out the other room?

48:53.100 --> 48:55.720
Yeah, we can go check out the other room.

48:55.720 --> 48:58.400
Let's let them keep working on this one.

48:58.400 --> 49:00.320
But in the meantime, that's what we'll be doing.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.880
Yeah, sure, but you know that all four of us

49:02.880 --> 49:04.680
can't talk all at the same time.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.120
Technically we could, but.

49:06.120 --> 49:06.960
I don't think so.

49:06.960 --> 49:07.780
Let's try it.

49:07.780 --> 49:08.620
We're doing it right now.

49:08.620 --> 49:09.460
Start talking.

49:09.460 --> 49:10.960
No one would want to listen.

49:10.960 --> 49:14.280
So two of you are going over to the furthest room,

49:14.280 --> 49:15.160
the storage room.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.860
Two of you are still searching

49:16.860 --> 49:19.520
in the Scott Adams primary room.

49:19.520 --> 49:20.760
You're in the bedroom.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.200
Are you checking out the notebook then?

49:22.200 --> 49:23.280
That's what you want to do?

49:23.280 --> 49:26.080
Well, I mean, so is there like a closed bathroom door

49:26.080 --> 49:29.240
staring at us or a lump under the covers?

49:29.240 --> 49:30.840
Slightly a jar bathroom door.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.000
There's nothing under the covers.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.120
The bed is definitely empty.

49:33.120 --> 49:34.880
Okay, I have picked up the notebook,

49:34.880 --> 49:38.760
but I do want to kind of kick open lightly with my foot,

49:38.760 --> 49:40.080
the bathroom door.

49:40.080 --> 49:41.160
And Harlan, where are you?

49:41.160 --> 49:42.680
So I just succeeded to search.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.520
Well, you told us there were two journals.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.100
What's the other journal?

49:46.100 --> 49:50.520
The other journal is just some like random UFO nonsense

49:50.520 --> 49:52.920
related to his watch the skies.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.240
It's like a log book.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.380
Those assorted documents.

49:56.380 --> 49:58.920
Can I look at those a little closer with that search rule?

49:58.920 --> 50:00.440
It's going to take you some time.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.300
So I'll let you kind of go through them in a little bit,

50:03.300 --> 50:04.880
but you're not going to be able to necessarily do it

50:04.880 --> 50:05.720
in real time.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.040
It's just, it's a mess.

50:07.040 --> 50:11.920
This room's been not necessarily like ransacked,

50:11.920 --> 50:14.540
but it's just in complete disarray.

50:14.540 --> 50:15.380
Yeah.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.000
Yeah, I'm sitting there looking through that stuff

50:17.000 --> 50:18.500
and he's going to the bathroom.

50:18.500 --> 50:20.400
So we'll kick off with Joe Dean

50:20.400 --> 50:21.600
before we get to the other room.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.920
So Joe Dean, you get to the bathroom

50:24.920 --> 50:26.780
and once the door is fully ajar,

50:26.780 --> 50:28.720
you see where the smell is coming from.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.680
You see a heavyset man in the bathtub,

50:33.680 --> 50:35.840
roughly 34 years old in age,

50:35.840 --> 50:38.200
curly black hair and a bushy beard.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.320
He's in boxer shorts and wearing a t-shirt

50:41.320 --> 50:44.760
Knoxville Fantasy Con 1989.

50:44.760 --> 50:47.900
He's up to his chest in water.

50:47.900 --> 50:49.840
Clearly the stopper is in the tub.

50:49.840 --> 50:54.040
To make matters worse, that water is deep red

50:54.040 --> 50:58.300
because you see numerous self-inflicted slashes

50:58.300 --> 51:02.720
all over his body, arms, legs, everywhere.

51:02.720 --> 51:04.640
Specifically the arms and legs.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.040
Specifically the arms and legs.

51:07.040 --> 51:10.760
You see floating in the water, just a single razor blade.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.440
If I look at back into the room,

51:14.440 --> 51:18.640
are there signs of an individual maybe like increasingly

51:18.640 --> 51:20.720
succumbing to this kind of pain?

51:22.040 --> 51:24.320
Is that how the room looks destroyed or?

51:24.320 --> 51:26.160
No, no pain medication.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.480
I guess what else did Billy Ray have

51:28.480 --> 51:30.560
that was kind of obvious?

51:30.560 --> 51:33.320
He talked about eating a lot and being hungry.

51:33.320 --> 51:36.820
You see some takeout containers, but nothing crazy.

51:36.820 --> 51:39.720
Yeah, not really a heck of a lot.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.340
Okay, well then I guess the last thing

51:41.340 --> 51:44.000
we wanna do in here is look at his computer.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.600
Are you gonna do anything with the body?

51:45.600 --> 51:48.560
I close the bathroom door and try to mitigate the smell

51:49.440 --> 51:50.280
and I kind of motioned to Harlan.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.680
I'm like, he's in there, you can have a look.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.140
Harlan, like even wordlessly is just like an affirmation.

51:56.140 --> 51:58.800
Like I knew he was gonna be in there.

51:58.800 --> 51:59.640
You should look.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.600
You wanna see a dead body?

52:02.600 --> 52:04.200
You wanna see a dead body?

52:04.200 --> 52:06.760
Do you need a second opinion?

52:06.760 --> 52:08.460
I will check, of course.

52:08.460 --> 52:10.880
I just, from Thomas to Joe,

52:10.880 --> 52:13.740
Harlan should see the insane way in which he died.

52:13.740 --> 52:15.120
And then either I can describe that to you

52:15.120 --> 52:16.740
or you can go look a look, take a look.

52:16.740 --> 52:20.780
Yeah, I mean, I'm researching documents,

52:20.780 --> 52:22.100
but I can go look in the bathroom.

52:22.100 --> 52:23.060
You wanna look at the body?

52:23.060 --> 52:24.400
I do, I guess I'll look at the body.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.220
You hear some noises in the bathtub.

52:27.220 --> 52:30.740
Ooh, like water sloshing or something else?

52:30.740 --> 52:32.900
You see, yes, at the surface,

52:32.900 --> 52:35.560
a little bit of bubbling coming up

52:35.560 --> 52:37.340
and the water's moving slightly.

52:37.340 --> 52:38.580
I called it, Jody.

52:38.580 --> 52:41.540
Did you notice this and I'm just pointing at the bubbles?

52:42.220 --> 52:47.220
Uh, Cindy, you guys wanna come take a look

52:50.300 --> 52:51.780
at this real quick?

52:51.780 --> 52:55.940
Cindy and Tanner are distracting Riker

52:55.940 --> 52:58.500
outside of both of these rooms.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.640
Yeah, we're really excited to try the Megaduce.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.480
Yeah.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.300
Everyone keeps telling us to go there.

53:04.300 --> 53:07.860
Well, what would you suggest that I order?

53:07.860 --> 53:09.900
Also don't breathe in through your nose.

53:09.900 --> 53:12.140
Jody and Ashley, he busts out the door.

53:12.140 --> 53:15.060
He says to Riker, strange question, maybe.

53:15.060 --> 53:19.340
You got a fishnet, a big fishnet, small fishnet.

53:19.340 --> 53:20.660
No, you know anybody with-

53:20.660 --> 53:23.340
I got toilet plunger.

53:28.260 --> 53:31.360
Can you bring me a fitted sheet?

53:31.360 --> 53:33.580
Okay, goes and gets you a fitted sheet.

53:33.580 --> 53:34.420
What's going on in there?

53:34.420 --> 53:36.660
Yeah, why a fitted sheet or a big net?

53:36.660 --> 53:38.100
Can we cut to the bathroom real quick?

53:38.100 --> 53:40.020
Harlan's still in there and I wanna see

53:40.020 --> 53:42.380
if the plug in the tub, is it a pull out?

53:42.380 --> 53:43.500
You have to reach in your hand in the water

53:43.500 --> 53:47.540
to pull it out or do you have to hit the switch on the side?

53:47.540 --> 53:48.380
There's no switch.

53:48.380 --> 53:50.640
So you have to press the button

53:50.640 --> 53:52.740
to get the spring to trigger or pull it out.

53:52.740 --> 53:53.580
It's one or the other.

53:53.580 --> 53:55.220
But it's reaching into the water either way.

53:55.220 --> 53:56.040
Yes.

53:56.040 --> 53:58.320
Could I find something long like,

53:58.320 --> 53:59.980
oh, can I pull the towel rack off?

53:59.980 --> 54:03.020
Like just to undo that and I wanna use that

54:03.020 --> 54:06.200
to push down on the thing to drain the tub.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.180
What if the thing goes down the drain?

54:08.180 --> 54:10.720
Ooh, that's why I wanted to like filter it out

54:10.720 --> 54:11.560
with the sheet.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.800
Yeah, I don't know.

54:13.800 --> 54:14.640
I see.

54:14.640 --> 54:16.680
Jodine, you looked initially at the body, right?

54:16.680 --> 54:17.560
And you left.

54:17.560 --> 54:18.400
Yes.

54:18.400 --> 54:20.240
And then you came back in with Harlan?

54:20.240 --> 54:21.080
Yes.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.240
Give me an alertness roll.

54:23.960 --> 54:24.940
11, a crit.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.800
With an 11, you notice something is different

54:27.800 --> 54:29.500
than when you were first in the room.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.000
And what's different was it looked initially

54:32.000 --> 54:36.240
like he had some sort of like large pimple

54:36.240 --> 54:39.520
or growth or something on his head,

54:39.520 --> 54:41.440
kind of right on his forehead.

54:41.440 --> 54:46.000
No hair on it, but it was like a growth on his skull.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.520
By the time you come back, it's gone.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.000
Harlan, step back.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.280
Get out of this bathroom.

54:53.280 --> 54:57.300
Harlan is holding the towel rack about to hit the thing.

54:57.300 --> 55:01.240
You hear from inside the pipes underneath the bathtub,

55:01.240 --> 55:06.240
bang, bang, bang, up against the stopper,

55:07.020 --> 55:10.040
something coming up from inside the pipes,

55:10.040 --> 55:14.640
going up into the bathtub, bang, bang.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.460
What do you do?

55:20.760 --> 55:21.840
Holy shit.

55:22.760 --> 55:24.920
If this is like fight, flight or freeze,

55:24.920 --> 55:26.040
we all just froze.

55:26.800 --> 55:27.640
Yeah.

55:29.480 --> 55:31.280
As you're standing there,

55:31.280 --> 55:35.160
eventually the clanging pushes through,

55:35.160 --> 55:39.440
the stopper bust out in this almost metallic looking liquid

55:39.440 --> 55:42.560
starts pouring up through the bloody water.

55:42.560 --> 55:45.660
So it starts cascading up into the ceiling,

55:45.660 --> 55:47.900
spraying bloody water everywhere.

55:47.900 --> 55:51.560
And then this metallic substance starts spraying

55:51.560 --> 55:52.640
all over the room.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.120
Oh my God.

55:55.400 --> 55:59.160
Those of you in the room, give me a Dodge.

56:01.440 --> 56:02.580
It's the Terminator.

56:04.800 --> 56:05.800
Holy shit.

56:05.800 --> 56:06.620
A one.

56:06.620 --> 56:07.600
I rolled a one.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.720
And I rolled a six on a 50.

56:09.720 --> 56:11.240
Oh, all right.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.060
So with both of those,

56:13.060 --> 56:16.260
you're able to just back out really quickly

56:16.260 --> 56:17.640
out of the bathroom,

56:17.640 --> 56:20.120
not getting wet from any of the either bloody water

56:20.120 --> 56:21.560
or this metallic stuff,

56:21.600 --> 56:26.360
but it sprays up as a geyser and then falls back down.

56:26.360 --> 56:29.200
And it's kind of mixed into this bloody water

56:29.200 --> 56:30.720
as the tub is draining.

56:30.720 --> 56:33.800
And everything that's sprayed up onto the walls and ceiling

56:33.800 --> 56:36.280
kind of conjoins together,

56:36.280 --> 56:39.200
almost like, you know, mercury beating together

56:39.200 --> 56:40.580
and starts going back,

56:40.580 --> 56:42.320
joining the rest of the stuff in the tub

56:42.320 --> 56:44.880
and starts swirling down the drain.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.560
Should we try to collect some?

56:46.560 --> 56:47.400
I don't know.

56:47.400 --> 56:50.040
I was not prepared for anything like this.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.180
Mr. Winners?

56:52.480 --> 56:54.560
Mr. Winners, I know it's the end of class,

56:54.560 --> 56:56.840
but you forgot to collect our homework.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.100
I don't want to be that guy,

56:59.100 --> 57:03.440
but can these guys roll a fucking sanity check?

57:03.440 --> 57:04.440
Oh yeah, shit.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.060
Yes, they most definitely can.

57:09.060 --> 57:11.200
Also, I have to pee so bad.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.320
Are we close to pee time?

57:14.320 --> 57:15.160
Yes, we are.

57:15.160 --> 57:15.980
That's a fail.

57:15.980 --> 57:17.600
Fail for me.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.960
Oh no.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.440
Oh yes.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.640
Oh yeah.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.600
Take four sanity damage each.

57:28.560 --> 57:29.400
We got it.

57:29.400 --> 57:32.220
Sorry, I was just, I was very much in the mood.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.320
Make them roll again.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.760
Do it, make them do it again.

57:37.200 --> 57:39.400
Oh, just wait till you two search room 11.

57:41.560 --> 57:44.400
Is it five for like temporary insanity?

57:44.400 --> 57:45.240
Yeah.

57:45.240 --> 57:46.280
Okay.

57:46.280 --> 57:47.100
Yep.

57:47.100 --> 57:48.440
You should have made it five.

57:49.640 --> 57:54.640
So a little bit of sanity damage,

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
but you're not wet from the metallic oozy stuff.

58:00.160 --> 58:01.680
Yeah, I think that probably would have been a day

58:01.680 --> 58:02.680
for you and me, Joe.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.040
What do you do though as it's swirling down the drain?

58:09.040 --> 58:10.080
Yeah, I don't know.

58:11.160 --> 58:16.160
Joe Dean grabs one of like a cup from the fast food debris,

58:16.600 --> 58:19.400
a Wendy's cup or some shit, whatever's there.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.880
And he just tries to grab a drop that's falling down

58:22.880 --> 58:25.400
from the ceiling and like catch it in the cup.

58:25.400 --> 58:26.800
He catches it.

58:26.800 --> 58:31.800
It recognizes its path almost was obstructed.

58:31.860 --> 58:36.080
It rapidly expands from being just a couple drops in size,

58:36.080 --> 58:41.080
outward, super flat, super wide, shattering the cup.

58:41.480 --> 58:44.160
And then the glass and liquid falls back into the tub.

58:44.520 --> 58:48.320
Joe Dean like drops it as it shatters in his hands,

58:49.440 --> 58:51.640
walks out of the bathroom and closes the door.

58:52.600 --> 58:55.920
Thomas's eyes were so big as you were describing that.

58:59.920 --> 59:02.780
Keep Rekker out of here.

59:02.780 --> 59:05.360
Rekker, I go outside and I'm gonna say Rekker,

59:05.360 --> 59:06.700
this was not the right fitted sheet.

59:06.700 --> 59:08.640
Like why don't you, can we go,

59:08.640 --> 59:10.600
we needed something different.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.200
Maybe I don't know what a fitted sheet is.

59:12.200 --> 59:13.900
Could you just bring back a lot of things

59:14.500 --> 59:15.920
from like the deepest part of your linen closet?

59:15.920 --> 59:17.060
Oh, sure, sure.

59:17.060 --> 59:19.380
Maybe crack open room 12 real quick.

59:19.380 --> 59:22.180
That way we can do a safety check in there before you go.

59:22.180 --> 59:23.780
Oh, 11, I think, but yeah.

59:23.780 --> 59:25.340
12, if you have it.

59:25.340 --> 59:28.240
Yeah, you can just leave us that key if that's all right.

59:28.240 --> 59:30.480
We really do need those linens quite quickly.

59:30.480 --> 59:31.320
I'll unlock it.

59:31.320 --> 59:32.620
You can open it when you need it.

59:32.620 --> 59:33.960
Okay, thank you.

59:33.960 --> 59:34.900
He jets off.

59:34.900 --> 59:36.240
Nice guy.

59:36.240 --> 59:40.700
Yeah, he has one of the most prestigious jobs in town.

59:40.740 --> 59:43.820
He's managing a 11 room motel.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.840
Big time for Merle, the richest man in town.

59:46.840 --> 59:47.740
Yeah.

59:47.740 --> 59:48.740
Exactly.

59:48.740 --> 59:49.940
By this time though,

59:49.940 --> 59:53.400
you can reason that the entire tub is drained.

59:54.300 --> 59:56.240
Now you have this room with a computer,

59:56.240 --> 59:59.940
some journals, and also room 11.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.920
Now the other thing that you can't see on the map

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.020
that I didn't mention,

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.980
there's actually a door inside of this room

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.460
conjoining room 10 and 11 as well.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.660
You can also try to go into room 11.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.180
There's a mech in that one closet.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:18.180
Well, when Riker lets us into room 11,

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.420
Tanner and Cindy will go in there.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.260
Yeah.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.080
Into room 11?

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:22.920
Yeah.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.500
Okay, you crack open the door,

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.940
you see a second motel room.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.940
This one in much better condition.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.120
However, you do see it's been lived in.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.260
This is not in fact a room for storage.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.460
There is clothing, a couple of suitcases,

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:41.460
and there is a young girl curled up in the fetal position

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:47.380
in the corner of the room silently up against the wall

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.340
listening to what was happening in Scott Adams's room.

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.940
Jane?

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:53.780
Jane?

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:55.940
Yeah?

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.060
Holy shit.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.860
Thank God that you're safe.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.420
And Cindy is gonna walk up,

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.740
pull a second cardigan out of her purse

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:12.320
and go to wrap it around the back of this poor girl.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.860
And Cindy's being real soft, taking a real gentle approach.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:21.780
Dear, can you tell us at all what happened?

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.160
I disappeared.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.000
Yeah.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.820
And, yeah, and something happened to me.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:31.660
It was three weeks ago.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.500
Okay.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.020
And as she stands up, you look at her.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.460
She is about six months pregnant.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.020
Oh, shit.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.140
Jane, Jane, how long?

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.820
You said you disappeared three weeks.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.340
How long were you gone?

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.780
A couple of hours.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.760
Jane, I have a really strange question to ask you.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.700
And I want you to just be very serious.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.940
Take it calm, okay?

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.600
How long have you been pregnant?

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.860
That's the thing.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.700
Yeah.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:14.060
Maybe a month?

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.380
Yeah.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.020
Is it Billy's?

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:17.900
Yes.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.740
Okay.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.140
Do you remember the lights?

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:23.980
Yes.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.500
Do you remember any sounds?

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.860
No, no.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.260
Any smells?

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.560
They put things in me.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.080
Yeah, I want to look at her arms.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.960
Well, actually, you don't see anything on her arms.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.160
What about her belly?

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.000
Yeah.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.760
So you'll find those same kind of incisions

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.000
all on her lower abdomen.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.680
She is just wearing a t-shirt inside.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.320
Another thing you'll notice in this room,

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.600
there are food containers galore.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.340
Compared to Scott Adams' room,

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.240
there are 10 times as many food containers.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.080
Any prescription, I assume?

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.360
No pain meds.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.180
Tylenol?

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.160
No.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.860
Doesn't seem like the muscle thing happened to her.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.480
You're one of those weak people

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.520
who relies on pain medication, aren't you, Tan?

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.040
Very odd way to phrase that, but yeah.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.480
Will you give this girl some?

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.920
She's pregnant, I don't know if you're supposed to take that.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.760
Just ibuprofen, I don't know.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:23.320
I don't know much about pregnancy.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.380
You can roll medicine for me.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.160
Oh wait, none of you took medicine.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.600
How about this, I'll roll anyway.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.260
David's like, it's about drugs,

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.600
and we're like, none of us will have the medicine skill.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.440
How about that?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.180
Yeah, it's not a crit fail, just a regular fail.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.020
Nice.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.800
You think it's fine.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Hey, Cindy, I think we found our alien.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.400
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.280
Jane, your mother is worried sick about you.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.560
I don't wanna see her.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.720
She can't see me like this.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.280
They're gonna be so disappointed in me.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.680
I don't know if they have the capacity for that.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.480
I just don't wanna see them.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.600
That's why I contacted Mr. Adams.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.640
Yeah, tell us, what's your relationship with Mr. Adams?

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.740
Just needed help.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.000
What kind of help were you looking for?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.720
What could he offer you?

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.160
Something to explain what happened to me,

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.020
the lights and everything.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:28.020
And he was in town and asking about aliens and stuff,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.100
and I thought maybe that would be it.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.740
I don't know, but he paid for this room.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.460
He was bringing me food.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.340
Did he help with anything else?

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.920
No, he just, he was keeping me safe.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.780
He was gonna take me to Nashville to see a doctor.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.620
He said, it's not safe here in town,

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.100
and I have to go elsewhere.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:51.620
And when was the last time you saw him?

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.860
I talked to him.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.060
Yesterday morning, he was supposed to bring me food,

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.900
and I'm getting so hungry.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.060
So you didn't go next door?

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.820
No, he told me to keep a low profile.

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.700
And what did you do with him the day before that?

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.620
He just told me to stay here.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.880
He said he was researching the town,

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.700
and once he had enough evidence,

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.340
we were gonna leave and go to Nashville.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.260
Did you guys physically touch?

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.680
Did you shake his hand?

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.420
Did you high-five him?

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.220
He might've put his hand on my shoulder at some point,

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.620
but I think maybe that's it.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.460
I don't know.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.940
I'm so hungry and scared.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.740
Well, we'll get you some food, okay?

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.400
Okay.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.340
Now you can all roll me a sanity.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.180
Yeah.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.920
Having seen this young girl who is four weeks pregnant,

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.020
but showing the signs of being around six months pregnant,

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.860
seven months pregnant.

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.780
Yeah, it's a fail.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.280
I had to fail for me as well.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.540
Three sanity damage.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.360
I am down to 44.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.900
I am down to 46.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.100
Ooh.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.860
Breaking point, 43.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.500
I'm at 36.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.420
I'm at a 45.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.740
Tanner feels sick,

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.740
and he's just like Luke is not sure what to do next.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.100
Would we be able to say that in this time

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.140
that they've been talking to her,

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.820
that Jodine and Harlan have gone through the papers

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.900
for Harlan and the computer for Jodine?

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.140
Fact, we would be able to.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:25.980
Sweet.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.540
Let's go through the paper first.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.340
Would there also be cool information in there

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.140
that they could learn that would be cool enough

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.420
to end an episode on?

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.000
Dude, I have to be so fast.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.980
Yep, right here.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:36.820
Sick.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.820
Yeah, you got any real prizes in there?

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:39.980
It's in front of you.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.400
Read off some of it.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.240
Oh, shit.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.060
Be surprised.

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:43.900
Gotcha.

01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:48.380
We've got a listing of number of livestock mutilations here.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.820
There were three cows, a goat, and 20 chickens.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.820
There's also livestock alterations.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.840
A cow was missing an udder, but otherwise in good health.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.180
Spotted three more in a roadside survey.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.740
Didn't know who the farmer was.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:07.080
We've also got accounts of missing time,

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.620
chopper sightings, lights.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.100
Everyone's seen some, it says.

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.780
Allen, Barn, Thomas, Jacobs, Cartwright, and Anderson

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.420
never go home.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.440
Never go home.

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.080
Do we know any of those names besides Allen?

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.400
Barn is Merle.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.140
Cartwright is the family from Bonanza.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.980
Yep.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.800
And also.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.640
Those are all the aldermen.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:36.380
You would have seen their names on offices.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.540
When we were in the courthouse,

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:38.500
we would have seen their names.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.980
Yeah, so Jane's dad, Merle Barn,

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.020
and then you would have seen the other names too.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.180
Oh, this is, we did know.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.380
That's not like some ominous, mysterious thing.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.700
We knew he wasn't going home.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.260
Right, but never go home.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.100
Exactly.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.260
But I thought it was like,

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.340
Scott Adams knows they'll never go home.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.380
Their story ends here.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:04.380
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:16.180
I gotta work in the morning

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:19.100
And this shit's so important

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.100
So I can't get high

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:29.100
No, I can't get high

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.420
I thought this stuff helped anxiety

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.620
It must be something inside of me

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.740
Does anybody know why?

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:45.740
I can't get high

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.740
I can't sit though I can

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:54.740
And I don't wanna try

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.740
Please, my smile, won't you spare me

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:03.500
Something more can be bought

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.500
Where do you begin?

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:12.500
I don't know how

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.500
Hallucination's so big-time, but

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.500
Spider's out the line

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:25.260
Breathing

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.260
I'm breathing

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:33.260
I've been hiding in low, low places

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.260
With some funny-looking dudes

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.260
With some fucked-up faces

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.260
And I can't help but feel it

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.260
I'll always be at the bottom

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.260
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:07.260
I think I'm allergic or something

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:10.260
Better go on with nothing

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.260
So I won't get high

01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:19.260
No, I won't get high

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.260
By all means, do it if it helps

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.260
For me, it makes my brain melt

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:32.260
Does anybody know why?

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:37.260
I can't get high

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:41.260
I can't sit though I can

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:46.260
And I don't wanna try

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:50.260
Please, my smile, won't you spare me

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.020
Something more can be bought

01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:59.020
Where do you begin?

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.020
I don't know how

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:08.020
Hallucination's so big-time, but

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:12.020
Spider's out the line

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:16.020
Breathing

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.780
Breathing

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:24.780
I've been hiding in low, low places

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.780
With some funny-looking dudes

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.780
With some fucked-up faces

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:31.780
And I can't help but feel it

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:34.780
I'll always be at the bottom

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:51.020
Thanks for watching!
