00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
Howdy my cowpups, it's your radio sheriff, Wolf the dog, and I'm wrangling up all of

00:07.320 --> 00:12.880
contention's juicy news from 694.2 PTBP.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.640
First up, a word with some friends on howlin' with Wolf.

00:16.640 --> 00:21.640
Your wolf brother Lord Morty wants to give a shoutout to all his dogs over at the discord

00:21.640 --> 00:24.840
server for the good friends of Jackson Elias.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.020
If you pups aren't part of the pack already, it's a place where you can yip, yap, wolf,

00:30.020 --> 00:36.320
or whimper about Call of Cthulhu, horror films, or horror gaming in general.

00:36.320 --> 00:42.140
Just dig out your doggy device, download the discord app, and search for the good friends

00:42.140 --> 00:44.320
of Jackson Elias.

00:44.320 --> 00:50.100
Keep those claws sharp and those canines sharper, see you wolf pups around.

00:50.260 --> 00:54.860
Now while this is a note from the producer, the good friends of Jackson Elias have been

00:54.860 --> 00:59.720
an integral part of this keeper's horror and roleplay education, if you're willing

00:59.720 --> 01:02.740
to lose some sanity along the way.

01:02.740 --> 01:07.860
And Scott Dorward, one of the good friends, was even kind enough to reply to this producer's

01:07.860 --> 01:15.220
reddit post regarding running his outstanding scenario, Hell in Texas, found in Stygian

01:15.220 --> 01:20.300
Fox's reality-breaking book, The Things We Leave Behind.

01:20.300 --> 01:24.860
If y'all want your best friend Wolf to read something you got to say, leave us a sweet

01:24.860 --> 01:31.060
five star review or tag us in a social media thing, y'all know the drill.

01:31.060 --> 01:34.380
And now we got a little news on the wire.

01:34.380 --> 01:39.140
Last I heard, Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased child's

01:39.140 --> 01:45.100
room at Hotel Motel, guns drawn, and sans warrant.

01:45.100 --> 01:50.660
There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz.

01:50.660 --> 01:55.620
But let me tell y'all, these were not happy days as she whipped a knife out at Officer

01:55.620 --> 02:00.140
Vigna after these so-called peacekeepers pulled the guns out.

02:00.140 --> 02:03.060
Guns are scary, y'all.

02:03.060 --> 02:07.900
The party had Greece and Professor Trelawney pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna

02:07.900 --> 02:13.900
engaged her in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in a hostage situation for the copper.

02:13.900 --> 02:19.220
Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing a coworker.

02:19.220 --> 02:24.420
But I heard the sweet-talkin' officer bishop managed to keep her from killin' him there

02:24.420 --> 02:25.980
on the spot.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.180
And now when that old wired lady made a run for it over the railin' and ran into the

02:30.180 --> 02:36.260
parking lot, all three of those officers unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor,

02:36.260 --> 02:39.820
bringin' her down before she could get into her vehicle.

02:39.820 --> 02:45.860
The officers patched her up and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren, the only

02:45.860 --> 02:49.100
decent officer left in contention.

02:49.100 --> 02:54.660
The scene was so dramatic for everyone stayin' at Hotel Motel, owners say they will likely

02:54.660 --> 02:59.380
have to shut down soon due to the negative reviews on Yelp.

02:59.380 --> 03:04.660
The officers are plannin' a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger runnin'

03:04.660 --> 03:07.780
about contention in an official police uniform.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.780
What?

03:09.780 --> 03:10.780
Wait a minute.

03:10.780 --> 03:16.460
Well, if we only get to listen to one song before some bald dude dressed as a cock comes

03:16.460 --> 03:23.260
and we all get got, let it be kudzu with no backbone.

03:38.780 --> 03:39.780
Hey Drew!

03:45.780 --> 03:52.300
Okay, so after about 15 minutes, a black SUV rolls up and parks a block away from the donut

03:52.300 --> 03:53.300
hole.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.900
A very short, young woman and a very tall, old man get out and they are both wearing

03:58.900 --> 04:04.700
a black suit, white shirt, black tie, black sunglasses, and an ill-fitting windbreaker

04:04.700 --> 04:08.620
that says FBI in big letters across the back.

04:08.620 --> 04:14.220
Clark, as you sip on your coffee, you hear the door behind you swing open.

04:14.220 --> 04:18.340
The door chimes jingle and jangle and you hear footsteps.

04:18.340 --> 04:24.020
Out of the corner of your eye, you see a short, young woman walk across the shop to the counter.

04:24.020 --> 04:26.740
The other footsteps approach you from behind.

04:26.740 --> 04:29.940
Wait, uh, John has his radio on him, but do you?

04:29.940 --> 04:30.940
No.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.620
You're all in plainclothes and I think at this point you were texting information.

04:33.620 --> 04:39.220
Okay, so I'm gonna text both of them, hey, it's not Billy, but it's two, what looked

04:39.220 --> 04:41.860
like two FBI agents just walked in.

04:41.860 --> 04:42.860
Send.

04:42.860 --> 04:44.220
Could you sext me that instead?

04:44.220 --> 04:46.060
Hey baby.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.500
Some female body inspectors just walked in.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.780
Clark, do you want to make any moves?

04:53.780 --> 04:54.980
One was approaching me.

04:54.980 --> 04:57.340
There are footsteps that approach you from behind.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.300
Someone is clearly like standing behind you.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.700
I think you had your newspaper up.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.700
Yeah, are they like standing behind me?

05:02.780 --> 05:03.780
Yep.

05:03.780 --> 05:04.780
Okay.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.780
I turn around and look up at them.

05:05.780 --> 05:07.940
It's this, uh, older dude.

05:07.940 --> 05:14.780
He's quite tall and he's pretty gruff looking and he just stares back down at you and his

05:14.780 --> 05:16.780
eyes are empty.

05:16.780 --> 05:20.260
Can I, can I help you?

05:20.260 --> 05:22.460
He stares.

05:22.460 --> 05:26.500
I slowly turn back around and refocus on the newspaper.

05:26.500 --> 05:32.260
As you're focused on the newspaper, you still hear this guy breathing behind you and the

05:32.300 --> 05:37.580
woman at the counter, she orders something from the guy behind the counter there.

05:37.580 --> 05:38.580
What's his name?

05:38.580 --> 05:39.580
Right?

05:39.580 --> 05:40.580
The donut hole.

05:40.580 --> 05:41.580
Yeah.

05:41.580 --> 05:42.580
His name is Duncan.

05:42.580 --> 05:43.580
Duncan Hole.

05:43.580 --> 05:46.580
Mr. Mr. Hole, Mr. Duncan Hole.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.580
Yo, Mr. H.

05:47.580 --> 05:56.740
He, uh, pours her a coffee and she walks and sits at the booth with Clark Bishop across

05:56.740 --> 05:57.940
from you.

05:57.940 --> 06:04.460
And she says, okay, John, where's the bag?

06:04.460 --> 06:05.460
Are you talking to me?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.460
Yeah.

06:06.460 --> 06:10.420
I'm not, I'm not John.

06:10.420 --> 06:11.580
Are you looking for John?

06:11.580 --> 06:12.580
Are you not John?

06:12.580 --> 06:13.580
I'm not John.

06:13.580 --> 06:18.700
Uh, well, you're wearing a hoodie and uh, you know, we just thought that you were John.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.100
No, I'm not John.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.100
Do you know John?

06:21.100 --> 06:22.100
Uh, John what?

06:22.100 --> 06:23.100
John Peters.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.100
Hmm.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.100
I've heard that name before.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.100
Huh.

06:26.260 --> 06:30.340
The man behind you, he puts a hand on your shoulder.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.740
I pet it.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.980
She says, we need you to direct us to John Peters.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.380
I don't, I don't know where John Peters is.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.380
Who are you?

06:42.380 --> 06:43.740
Uh, my name's Clark.

06:43.740 --> 06:44.740
Clark what?

06:44.740 --> 06:45.740
Clark Bishop.

06:45.740 --> 06:46.740
Clark Bishop.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.740
What do you do?

06:47.740 --> 06:50.300
Uh, I actually happen to be a officer here in this town.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.300
Oh, of course.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.300
Yes.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.300
Of course.

06:53.300 --> 06:54.300
You're officer Bishop.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.300
Oh, that's right.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.580
Um, where's John Peters then?

06:57.580 --> 06:58.580
You should know.

06:58.580 --> 07:02.660
No, uh, man, we don't know.

07:02.660 --> 07:07.460
Do you have anything for us?

07:07.460 --> 07:11.620
I mean, if you hadn't walked in here, we might have had something.

07:11.620 --> 07:17.540
Me and my, uh, my fellow officers, this is kind of a, we're curious about John too.

07:17.540 --> 07:18.540
We're working on it though.

07:18.540 --> 07:23.300
I'll tell you what, more specifically than John Peters, we're looking for a bag.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
What kind of bag?

07:24.300 --> 07:25.900
It's a black Nike bag.

07:25.900 --> 07:29.340
It was in a storage unit here in contention and we're looking for it.

07:29.340 --> 07:30.340
Huh.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.700
Uh, what would be in the bag?

07:31.700 --> 07:32.700
Nothing.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.340
Well, we'll keep an eye out for it.

07:34.340 --> 07:36.340
That's for dang sure.

07:36.340 --> 07:39.420
Okay, well.

07:39.420 --> 07:46.260
Hey, off character, off conversation, did we find that in the storage locker?

07:46.260 --> 07:47.260
Yeah.

07:47.260 --> 07:48.260
What was in it?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.580
The cocaine or is it literally a bag of nothing?

07:49.580 --> 07:51.380
There's literally a Nike bag.

07:51.380 --> 07:52.740
Oh shit.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.740
Is that in the-

07:53.780 --> 07:55.020
Is there something horrifying in it?

07:55.020 --> 07:56.020
Did we open it?

07:56.020 --> 08:00.100
I think Clark opened it and he's asked what was inside and I told him there's nothing

08:00.100 --> 08:02.060
in there.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.780
I want to look in the Nike bag.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.100
There's nothing in there.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.780
Is there anything in the leather backpack?

08:07.780 --> 08:08.780
Is it at the prison?

08:08.780 --> 08:09.780
At the jail?

08:09.780 --> 08:13.860
Yeah, it's, it's like in the police department, locked up in one of the cells with all the

08:13.860 --> 08:15.580
other stuff.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.540
Is there a reason you're looking for an empty bag?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.820
You know, I think that's above your pay grade.

08:19.820 --> 08:20.820
Oh, is it?

08:20.820 --> 08:21.820
Oh, definitely.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.260
I mean, he's just a missing person at this point, right?

08:24.260 --> 08:28.580
We're not looking for him necessarily, but we thought that he could take us to the bag.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.940
John Peters had the keys for those storage units.

08:31.940 --> 08:34.340
We went by those storage units.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.340
They're empty.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.340
Hmm.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.340
How about that?

08:37.340 --> 08:39.940
Can I, can I hear this on the, in the bathroom?

08:39.940 --> 08:40.940
Yeee, roll.

08:40.940 --> 08:41.940
Yes, roll.

08:41.940 --> 08:42.940
Uh, alertness.

08:42.940 --> 08:43.940
Uh, 87.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.060
I forgot to take my headphones out.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.140
What are you listening to?

08:49.140 --> 08:50.980
Like a conspiracy theory podcast?

08:50.980 --> 08:51.980
Yeah.

08:51.980 --> 08:52.980
Natch.

08:52.980 --> 08:53.980
Niberia.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.460
I'm just failing to understand how a guy from my town missing an empty bag is above

08:58.460 --> 08:59.460
my pay grade.

08:59.460 --> 09:00.460
Yeah.

09:00.460 --> 09:01.460
I'm trying to help.

09:01.460 --> 09:02.460
Okay.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.780
Well, if you don't know any more information, then you can't be of any help, can you?

09:05.780 --> 09:07.700
I guess, I guess not.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.680
How about if I find that bag, I'll give you guys a call.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.420
We would certainly appreciate it.

09:12.420 --> 09:16.420
But since we're here talking to an officer of the law, I think you might be able to help

09:16.420 --> 09:19.980
us out with some information about some things that are happening in this town.

09:19.980 --> 09:25.180
You see, we know about the body in the junkyard and we know about the chopped up body in the

09:25.180 --> 09:28.660
plastic trunk with the woman's head that was split open.

09:28.660 --> 09:33.260
We're also pretty sure that you killed a man named Charles earlier this evening.

09:33.260 --> 09:37.260
And I believe you also shot a woman at hotel motel earlier tonight.

09:37.260 --> 09:43.980
So I think maybe officer Bishop, you're not in much of a place to say what should be done

09:43.980 --> 09:44.980
next.

09:44.980 --> 09:45.980
Oh boy.

09:45.980 --> 09:46.980
In character.

09:46.980 --> 09:47.980
No, for real.

09:47.980 --> 09:48.980
For real.

09:48.980 --> 09:49.980
Just like, uh-uh.

09:49.980 --> 09:50.980
No, no you.

09:50.980 --> 09:52.980
You didn't, how'd you hear about that?

09:52.980 --> 09:57.980
That head in a bucket thing, what's that about?

09:57.980 --> 10:03.860
Well, you sent off some stuff to county, didn't you?

10:03.860 --> 10:06.560
We talked to them and they won't be talking anymore.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
County won't be talking?

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
We didn't kill them.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.980
No, we just, there are certain things that need to be kept away from the knowledge of

10:11.980 --> 10:12.980
the people.

10:12.980 --> 10:13.980
That's one of them.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.940
Clark, Bishop, they told you about the difference between the age of the inside and the age

10:17.940 --> 10:20.300
of the outside of the corpse from the junkyard, did they not?

10:20.300 --> 10:21.580
Yeah, about that lab fuckup?

10:21.580 --> 10:22.980
Yeah, they told me about that.

10:22.980 --> 10:24.340
That's a big oopsie on their part.

10:24.340 --> 10:27.460
Yeah, they're clearly not very good at their jobs.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.460
Now I'll ask you one more time, officer Bishop.

10:30.460 --> 10:34.020
Do you know anything about this black Nike bag that we look for?

10:34.020 --> 10:36.460
Because we're not leaving this town until we find it?

10:36.460 --> 10:37.460
Agent, uh...

10:37.460 --> 10:41.100
Kennedy, this is my partner, Agent McKinley.

10:41.100 --> 10:45.220
And you kind of look over and he nods at you, he looks down, he nods.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.820
He's still holding your shoulder.

10:46.820 --> 10:47.820
What does this guy look like?

10:47.820 --> 10:48.820
I'm imagining like a-

10:48.820 --> 10:53.700
Old dude with empty eyes and like a tanned leather skin.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.540
Oh, I seem like a John Malkovich, but...

10:56.540 --> 11:02.600
Well, the woman that's talking is really young and really short and she's just kind of like

11:02.600 --> 11:04.820
bright eyed, bushy tail, weird voice.

11:04.820 --> 11:05.820
Like a squirrel.

11:05.820 --> 11:07.660
Yeah, she's very similar to a squirrel.

11:07.740 --> 11:12.180
Like a Scottish squirrel or Canadian, whatever she, whatever accent she's got.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.180
A Scottish Canadian girl?

11:13.180 --> 11:14.180
Where the fuck is she from?

11:14.180 --> 11:15.180
Ireland?

11:15.180 --> 11:19.180
Shit, you haven't talked about that yet.

11:19.180 --> 11:24.060
Yeah, Agent Kennedy, Agent McKinley.

11:24.060 --> 11:28.380
I do know some stuff that's been going on around here that's honestly, it's just real

11:28.380 --> 11:29.380
weird.

11:29.380 --> 11:33.140
The reason I wasn't totally forthcoming with you is I don't know exactly what the hell's

11:33.140 --> 11:34.140
going on.

11:34.380 --> 11:40.060
And we've been playing it tight to the chest so far because boy, we might be in a little

11:40.060 --> 11:41.520
over our heads at this point.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.780
At this point I am texting, what are they asking?

11:44.780 --> 11:47.380
What do they know?

11:47.380 --> 11:48.460
You get that text.

11:48.460 --> 11:51.020
And she says, are we keeping you from something more important?

11:51.020 --> 11:53.740
I mean, we had a sting set up for tonight.

11:53.740 --> 11:54.940
That's kind of what this all was.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.660
That's why I'm not wearing my uniform right now.

11:56.660 --> 11:59.180
Oh, this was a sting operation you say?

11:59.180 --> 12:00.180
Yeah.

12:00.180 --> 12:03.180
You walked in with the FBI thing on your jacket, which kind of fucked all that up.

12:03.220 --> 12:09.500
Well, we were also looking for John Peters and we were also listening, so I guess we've

12:09.500 --> 12:10.500
been stung.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.020
I guess we stung you on that one, didn't we?

12:12.020 --> 12:13.260
I guess the plan kind of worked.

12:13.260 --> 12:14.260
I suppose in a way.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.440
Who are you looking for?

12:15.440 --> 12:17.620
What bee were you hoping to grab the end of?

12:17.620 --> 12:25.140
Earlier this evening, one of my associates was injured in a little incident at the hospital

12:25.140 --> 12:31.580
up there and a guy we had in custody kind of got the better of him, took his uniform.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.540
And so we were trying to catch him.

12:33.540 --> 12:35.300
We were trying to get him back here.

12:39.180 --> 12:43.660
So there is a civilian running about in a contention police officer's clothes.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.060
Listen, I told you we were in over our heads.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.860
I'm not proud of everything that's happened tonight.

12:47.860 --> 12:51.460
You guys really seem to have the top on this whole situation, don't you?

12:51.460 --> 12:53.700
I mean, we had a sting set up.

12:53.700 --> 12:54.700
We were on it.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.700
Well, sorry.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.700
That's okay.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.700
Ding.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.700
Oh boy.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.700
Give me a hit of that vape while we're at it.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.700
You guys want to hear that annoying sound?

13:11.700 --> 13:12.700
Yeah.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.700
It's hard to talk and not cough with this in your mouth.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.700
I had a dollar every time your mom said that.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.180
How many dollars would you have?

13:26.180 --> 13:30.180
So Joe is a little bit at a loss, but I think it's because Clark would be at a little bit

13:30.180 --> 13:31.180
of a loss.

13:31.780 --> 13:35.020
I don't know where I stand with these guys at fucking all because I think we're past

13:35.020 --> 13:36.580
the point of like lying to them.

13:36.580 --> 13:40.900
Well, we're past the point of like our characters being like trying to be good policemen.

13:40.900 --> 13:45.700
You have committed, we've all committed like super felonies, but I think that also is why

13:45.700 --> 13:50.100
Clark is in like a, Oh, cause he's like wants to help out, but he's like, uh, I will go

13:50.100 --> 13:51.100
to jail for sure.

13:51.100 --> 13:55.100
He was a good cop 24 hours ago, whatever it was.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.500
It should have been me cause I would have had no problem lying to him.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.620
I would just have a problem lying to him.

14:01.620 --> 14:05.420
It's like 1am on December 4th, the morning of December 4th now.

14:05.420 --> 14:09.580
And this all started the evening of December 1st so it really hasn't been very much time

14:09.580 --> 14:10.580
at all.

14:10.580 --> 14:11.580
Yeah.

14:11.580 --> 14:12.580
What do they expect from us?

14:12.580 --> 14:13.580
What are we, the FBI?

14:13.580 --> 14:15.820
Are you, uh, you folks, uh, you guys in town for a while?

14:15.820 --> 14:19.100
Officer Bishop, we're in town for as long as we need to be good.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.380
How about we all go home, get a good night's sleep and I'll share with you all we've got

14:23.380 --> 14:25.540
so far tomorrow at the station.

14:25.540 --> 14:33.500
Don't persuade because they would rather go to the station right now.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.380
What the fuck dude?

14:35.380 --> 14:36.380
Yes.

14:36.380 --> 14:39.580
I don't know what to do.

14:39.580 --> 14:42.140
That's that's that's a set that I don't ever use.

14:42.140 --> 14:45.820
That's the third set that you've rolled a not one with in this game.

14:45.820 --> 14:46.820
Stop apologizing.

14:46.820 --> 14:47.820
Your hands are touched by God.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.220
I just feel bad narratively.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.580
Like I'm winning every time.

14:50.580 --> 14:55.500
Just tell them that we're all losing willpower right now and we need to take it.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.800
Mechanically it would be better for all of us if we met in the morning.

14:58.800 --> 15:05.540
She looks at agent McKinley and looks back at you and she says, fair enough.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.020
What time shall we meet in the morning?

15:07.020 --> 15:08.540
How about a 10 o'clock?

15:08.540 --> 15:14.620
We'll see you bright and early at 10 o'clock and agent McKinley and agent Kennedy walk

15:14.620 --> 15:16.220
out of the donut hole.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.500
Which one was Kennedy?

15:17.500 --> 15:23.980
Kennedy was the female woman from agent Kennedy was the short one, the young woman from the

15:23.980 --> 15:27.140
agent McKinley was the, uh, the tall old man.

15:27.140 --> 15:28.140
Oh, sure.

15:28.140 --> 15:29.140
Where do you think she was born?

15:29.140 --> 15:30.140
What abouts?

15:30.140 --> 15:31.140
God.

15:31.140 --> 15:32.140
Who knows?

15:32.140 --> 15:33.140
Guys?

15:33.140 --> 15:37.580
I got, I thought of this one, you know, all the, like the black goo we've been seeing.

15:37.580 --> 15:42.660
It's CPD oil, like contention, police department.

15:42.660 --> 15:44.860
That's not a very good one.

15:44.860 --> 15:49.500
There's not a whole lot there.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.820
And edit point and cut.

15:53.820 --> 15:54.820
I think.

15:54.820 --> 15:55.820
Yeah.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.820
That's let's in an episode right there.

15:56.820 --> 16:03.740
CPD oil, and then we'll end it before the punchline and pick up next week with oil real

16:03.740 --> 16:14.140
quick and then it'll be 10 am, but not that, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no snacks.

16:14.140 --> 16:19.880
As soon as those two leave, I'm furiously texting those guys or you guys furiously.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.880
What do you say?

16:20.880 --> 16:21.880
Oh shit.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
The FBI is here.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.800
They talked to me.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.800
We got to get together.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
Come to the car.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.800
I send back.

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800
And I do.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.280
And so I walk out of the bathroom and nobody's left in the restaurant and I mean, I'm coming

16:32.280 --> 16:37.020
to the car, but I'm still a little like, wow, I could have waited for him.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.040
You guys hop in the car.

16:38.040 --> 16:44.320
So the FBI is here and they seem to know a lot, in fact, maybe more than we do about

16:44.320 --> 16:46.080
all this crazy shit that's been happening.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.080
What do they know?

16:47.080 --> 16:50.120
They know about the storage units and a lot of the crazy shit.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.240
Do they know that we have the stuff in the storage units?

16:52.240 --> 16:55.860
I wasn't forthright with that, but by the end of it, it seems like they pretty much

16:55.860 --> 16:56.860
know that we do.

16:56.860 --> 16:57.860
Okay.

16:57.860 --> 16:58.860
Wow.

16:58.860 --> 16:59.860
Okay.

16:59.860 --> 17:00.860
So we should get back to the PD and...

17:00.860 --> 17:03.840
So they're going to come by tomorrow morning at 10 and I told them we cooperate.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.160
We need to stash that stuff, yeah, but we're keeping that cool shit, right?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.600
Or do we cooperate with them?

17:08.600 --> 17:09.600
No.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.780
We cooperate, but they don't know we did it.

17:11.780 --> 17:19.940
We took cocaine and didn't report it to anybody and tons of illegal weapons, but they knew

17:19.940 --> 17:21.700
that we killed Charles.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.700
They knew...

17:22.700 --> 17:28.900
Yeah, but all the murders, I mean, all the things we had to do, we had to do on official

17:28.900 --> 17:29.900
police business.

17:29.900 --> 17:30.900
Of course.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
And we would explain that to them.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.900
I'm just saying that they're aware of us potentially being off the deep end.

17:34.900 --> 17:39.340
Yeah, well, maybe we send them off the deep end and get the whole FBI after.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.340
Wow.

17:40.340 --> 17:43.340
I think we got your head in the wrong place about this whole murder thing.

17:43.340 --> 17:47.800
So how do you think they know that we have all the...

17:47.800 --> 17:49.540
They mentioned that head in the tub.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.900
Did they know what else was in the unit?

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900
Did they mention that?

17:51.900 --> 17:52.900
Yeah.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.020
They're looking for a black Nike bag.

17:54.020 --> 17:58.860
So they didn't mention cocaine or machine guns or sniper rifles?

17:58.860 --> 18:03.500
So they know that the storage units were cleared out and they knew that John was supposed to

18:03.500 --> 18:04.500
have the keys to them.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.140
Okay, we found the Nike bag in the hotel room.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.460
Yeah, let's give them the Nike bag.

18:08.460 --> 18:12.640
And we didn't think, you know, until you knew who they were, we weren't going to just give

18:12.640 --> 18:13.640
it over.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.640
You know what I mean?

18:14.640 --> 18:17.740
We can say, I've got the Nike bag and then let's stash all the rest of the stuff somewhere

18:17.740 --> 18:18.740
else.

18:18.740 --> 18:20.180
Cause I'm not looking to go to jail for...

18:20.180 --> 18:21.180
Or at John...

18:21.180 --> 18:22.500
We found it somewhere.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.660
Maybe we went and poked around John Peter's house again and there it was.

18:25.660 --> 18:26.660
Who knows?

18:26.660 --> 18:27.660
I'm just saying...

18:27.660 --> 18:28.660
Let's lie.

18:28.660 --> 18:29.660
I'm saying let's lie.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.660
Cause I don't want to go to jail.

18:30.660 --> 18:31.940
Give up all that cocaine.

18:31.940 --> 18:32.940
Yeah.

18:32.940 --> 18:33.940
But where can we put it?

18:33.940 --> 18:37.580
Back in the storage units?

18:37.580 --> 18:38.780
The last place they'll look.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.200
Real fuck with them.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.980
Do you think we should cooperate with them on the bag?

18:42.980 --> 18:45.100
Cause that's of no use to us right now.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.100
It's just an empty bag.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.300
I want to look at that bag now.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.100
Let's go back to the PD and figure out what we're going to do from there.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.580
Also, have they left yet?

18:52.580 --> 18:53.580
Yes.

18:53.580 --> 18:55.220
Okay, let's all go back to the police department and...

18:55.220 --> 18:56.220
It's right across the street.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.220
We can see it.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.220
Okay, let's go.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.220
We're back.

19:00.220 --> 19:08.740
An odd thing awaits you when you walk into the police department.

19:08.740 --> 19:09.740
Not Drew.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.740
Drew is not at the police department.

19:12.740 --> 19:16.340
Well, we need to change that because somebody's going to have to move all this stuff.

19:16.340 --> 19:17.340
It's late.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.340
It's not going to be us.

19:18.340 --> 19:21.980
When's the last time you didn't see Drew when you were here?

19:21.980 --> 19:23.500
What do we see?

19:23.500 --> 19:30.500
There is just a note on Drew's desk and it says, went to the chief's house, we'll be

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
back.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.500
Is it Drew's handwriting?

19:32.500 --> 19:33.500
Yep.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
Is there time or anything on it?

19:34.500 --> 19:35.500
Nope.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
Okay.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.540
And as you guys walk in, Dr. Marie Jacobs stirs from her cell in the back and she's

19:39.540 --> 19:46.740
like, hey Marie, doctor, shouldn't you be asleep right now?

19:46.740 --> 19:49.180
Shouldn't you be officer-ing?

19:49.180 --> 19:50.180
We are.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.180
We happen to be officer-ing.

19:51.180 --> 19:53.460
This is our office to officer at.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.080
Shh, you'll wake him.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.160
And Salem is like asleep on her, on her lap.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.140
It's your shrill ass who's going to wake him.

20:01.140 --> 20:03.340
He doesn't wake up to my voice.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.940
It's just stranger's voices.

20:05.940 --> 20:09.500
The way the police department is set up, can you see into the cells and stuff as soon as

20:09.500 --> 20:10.500
you walk in?

20:10.500 --> 20:15.560
No, but you could hear voices echoing in such a way that like you can definitely tell it's

20:15.560 --> 20:21.480
hitting bags of cocaine and weapons and they would just have to take a quick look around

20:21.480 --> 20:22.480
to find all that shit.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.480
Right.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.480
Oh yeah.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.480
Yeah.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.560
It would be five steps into the back room and you'd be like, Oh, there's a lot of stuff

20:27.560 --> 20:28.560
back here.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.560
Yeah.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
Okay.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
We don't want that to happen.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.780
I'm imagining that each cell is individually barred from the front.

20:35.780 --> 20:41.060
However, they are separated in an opaque fashion from cell to cell.

20:41.060 --> 20:46.020
How long would it take us to put up some, uh, like a false wall, dry wall, just thinking

20:46.020 --> 20:47.020
some dry wall around.

20:47.020 --> 20:50.260
We move it all into the last cell and put up a fake wall.

20:50.260 --> 20:51.260
Fuck this guys.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.260
Let's just text Drew.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.260
Let's call Drew.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.260
Okay.

20:54.260 --> 20:55.260
Yeah.

20:55.260 --> 21:04.780
Hey, this is a Drew Andrews.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.260
Give a message after the beep.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.260
Thank you.

21:07.260 --> 21:08.260
Bye.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.260
Click.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.260
I don't leave fucking voicemails.

21:10.260 --> 21:11.260
It's a text message in world.

21:11.260 --> 21:12.260
Uh, he wasn't around.

21:12.260 --> 21:13.260
Okay.

21:13.260 --> 21:14.260
What do you think?

21:14.260 --> 21:15.900
I think priority number one is get our goodies somewhere else.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.460
Where do we put them all?

21:17.460 --> 21:18.460
At your house.

21:18.460 --> 21:19.460
Oh shit.

21:19.460 --> 21:20.460
Yeah.

21:20.460 --> 21:21.460
Yeah.

21:21.460 --> 21:22.460
Yeah.

21:22.460 --> 21:25.060
Uh, you live the farthest out of town, don't you?

21:25.060 --> 21:26.060
Okay.

21:26.060 --> 21:27.060
Let's put them at your house.

21:27.060 --> 21:28.060
We could do that.

21:28.060 --> 21:29.060
We could nimby it up.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.060
I'll just take a little bit of home.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.340
I live at a motel right now.

21:32.340 --> 21:36.420
And there's a scene of the crime a few doors down for me.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.420
Maybe not.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.420
Maybe not in my room.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.420
You guys could split it up.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.860
Like maybe John Lee Pettymore could take all the guns.

21:41.860 --> 21:46.420
Clark could take all the cocaine or just switch those, swap those right around.

21:46.420 --> 21:47.420
Yeah.

21:47.420 --> 21:48.420
That sounds good to me.

21:48.420 --> 21:49.420
That all does sound good to me.

21:49.420 --> 21:52.300
It's just that realistically that's a, we have, there's so much shit in those storage

21:52.300 --> 21:53.300
lockers.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.580
Like we just kind of montage this.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.860
I've already got the cocaine.

21:55.860 --> 21:56.860
I'll see you later.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.460
We probably still have the U-Haul, right?

21:59.460 --> 22:00.460
Yeah.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.420
The police U-Haul.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.540
You've got some sort of police U-Haul.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.540
Box trucks.

22:05.540 --> 22:07.260
Can we just montage that real quick?

22:07.260 --> 22:10.940
It is 1am when this started.

22:10.940 --> 22:14.140
So it's at least 1.30 now.

22:14.140 --> 22:15.140
Maybe two.

22:15.140 --> 22:20.380
So I'm going to have you guys all lose another willpower point if you're going to keep going.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.380
What's everybody at?

22:21.380 --> 22:22.380
Seven.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.380
Nine.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.380
I'm at nine.

22:24.380 --> 22:25.660
So how long is this going to take us to do?

22:25.660 --> 22:26.660
Two hours.

22:26.660 --> 22:28.900
So it's 3.30 once we get back to the police department.

22:28.900 --> 22:31.460
Yeah, you'll lose two more willpower points.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.620
I'm definitely, I may not.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.300
We can regain them by sleeping and stuff, right?

22:35.300 --> 22:37.140
Yeah, I'm not heading back to the police department.

22:37.140 --> 22:40.020
A full night's sleep gives you 1D6 willpower.

22:40.020 --> 22:43.220
Okay, so let's, we'll take it to the respective places and meet back up.

22:43.220 --> 22:46.500
How about we meet back up at like an hour before they get here?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.060
I mean, yeah, eight o'clock, whatever.

22:48.060 --> 22:49.460
Yeah, let's get here at eight.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.420
That way we have a couple hours to talk about what the hell we're going to do.

22:52.420 --> 22:54.820
Okay guys, we're going to get to work on time and then...

22:54.820 --> 22:55.820
Plan.

22:55.820 --> 22:56.820
Plot.

22:57.340 --> 22:58.340
I think we're plotting.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.340
This is fine.

22:59.340 --> 23:00.340
Yeah.

23:00.340 --> 23:05.900
Okay, so real quick, if we're going to montage through these, let's go ahead and get a quick

23:05.900 --> 23:08.700
rundown of where everything is going.

23:08.700 --> 23:13.540
Oh shit, wait, at some point in the two hours, we would definitely realize that we should

23:13.540 --> 23:17.180
check up on Drew at the chief's house, especially since he doesn't call us back.

23:17.180 --> 23:20.460
If you guys are taking this stuff to your house, I can go to the chief's house.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.660
I think it would be a really good idea for Keith to split off by himself.

23:23.660 --> 23:32.700
I mean, especially, okay, yeah, I call him one more time.

23:32.700 --> 23:33.700
Same thing.

23:33.700 --> 23:37.420
Okay, I guess I'm going to go to the chief's house while you guys get all this back to

23:37.420 --> 23:38.420
your houses.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.420
Good night, Keith.

23:39.420 --> 23:40.420
Good luck, man.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.420
Oh, I don't need it.

23:41.420 --> 23:47.500
I mean, you haven't used any luck so far, so real quick, Clark and John, who is taking

23:47.500 --> 23:49.460
what to your respective homes?

23:49.460 --> 23:51.500
I mean, there is a shitload of shit in there.

23:51.500 --> 23:57.380
I want to take all of the important documents we found and I'll take some of the guns or

23:57.380 --> 23:58.620
all the guns either way.

23:58.620 --> 24:02.620
You take some of the guns, I'll take some of the guns.

24:02.620 --> 24:06.180
We wouldn't want a man like you wanted up, caught with all that cocaine.

24:06.180 --> 24:09.820
You know, the Pennymores, I can just say it was left on the property, you know what I

24:09.820 --> 24:10.820
mean?

24:10.820 --> 24:11.820
Yeah.

24:11.820 --> 24:12.820
Yeah.

24:12.820 --> 24:13.820
Thanks for doing that for me, John.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.820
No worries, man.

24:14.820 --> 24:15.820
I got your back, brother.

24:15.820 --> 24:16.820
I don't want to get penalized for forgetting what all-

24:16.820 --> 24:17.820
Absolutely.

24:17.820 --> 24:18.820
You won't be.

24:18.820 --> 24:19.820
We'll take everything, yeah.

24:19.820 --> 24:20.820
How about that?

24:21.140 --> 24:24.340
We'll take everything unless there's something that you would think that we should talk about

24:24.340 --> 24:25.340
who gets.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.340
Yeah.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.340
What are the other important things?

24:27.340 --> 24:28.340
How about this?

24:28.340 --> 24:29.340
John takes half the guns and all the cocaine.

24:29.340 --> 24:31.220
You take the other half of guns and everything else.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.380
The question is what's in everything else?

24:33.380 --> 24:36.620
Is the cursed turtle we found going to explode or something that we forgot about?

24:36.620 --> 24:42.940
The cursed turtle will explode, which will be an issue for you specifically as a character.

24:42.940 --> 24:47.460
Also how about I take the empty bag, throw it in the trunk of my cruiser.

24:47.460 --> 24:50.740
That way I can be like, you can act like you had no idea about it.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.100
That's a really good idea.

24:53.100 --> 25:00.660
You know what, relying on your incompetence as an alibi is the least incompetent idea

25:00.660 --> 25:01.660
you've ever had.

25:01.660 --> 25:03.140
Thank you so much, guys.

25:03.140 --> 25:06.340
But real fast, I want to take a look at it here right now.

25:06.340 --> 25:07.340
Yeah, let's look at the bag.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.460
You guys go in the back and you find a black Nike bag.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.380
It's a drawstring bag like you would take to the gym.

25:13.380 --> 25:17.060
It has a Nike swish on it and it says Nike on it.

25:17.060 --> 25:18.060
Nothing inside.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.060
Nick.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.060
There's nothing inside.

25:20.380 --> 25:21.380
Is there anything in the office that I can run over?

25:21.380 --> 25:22.380
I'm sure we do.

25:22.380 --> 25:24.020
I'm sure we have a wand of some kind.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.020
Yeah.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.020
There's so much metal.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.780
I pointed Breathalyzer at it.

25:27.780 --> 25:28.780
In the bag.

25:28.780 --> 25:29.860
There's a metal in the bag.

25:29.860 --> 25:33.100
If you swipe it over the top of it, there's a lot of metal in the bag.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.580
What does that mean to us though?

25:34.580 --> 25:35.980
So when I look into it though, it's empty?

25:35.980 --> 25:36.980
Yeah, it's black.

25:36.980 --> 25:37.980
It's empty.

25:37.980 --> 25:40.780
And it feels just like a regular empty drawstring bag.

25:40.780 --> 25:41.780
Spitball in here.

25:41.780 --> 25:43.180
Maybe you can catch the goo with it.

25:43.180 --> 25:44.180
Maybe.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.180
We can talk about it more in the morning.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.180
I cast ritual detect magic.

25:47.180 --> 25:53.180
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spellcasting modifier.

25:53.180 --> 25:54.180
Alrighty.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.180
Nat 20.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.180
Whoa.

25:56.180 --> 26:02.580
You needed a 40.

26:02.580 --> 26:05.340
We all watch Clark do that.

26:05.340 --> 26:10.300
Just, hey buddy, I think you need to get, I think you should get some sleep.

26:10.300 --> 26:17.140
Go ahead and roll a sanity test for me as you pass the wand over the top of the bag.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.100
That's a 94 on a 42.

26:19.100 --> 26:23.260
Okay, you just lose one and you know something's up.

26:23.260 --> 26:24.580
Something's up with this bag.

26:24.580 --> 26:25.900
What's up with that?

26:25.900 --> 26:26.900
Yo, so should we?

26:26.900 --> 26:28.420
Yeah, what's up with that?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.460
Should we keep it or should we hand it over?

26:30.460 --> 26:33.660
That's kind of what I'm getting at is that maybe if we hand it over, they'll tell us

26:33.660 --> 26:34.660
what it is.

26:34.660 --> 26:35.980
I like that idea.

26:35.980 --> 26:38.740
We haven't really gotten any help from anybody else yet.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.380
Yeah, they seem like they know.

26:40.380 --> 26:42.460
Also maybe they'll leave us alone if.

26:42.460 --> 26:44.500
Or just take this off our plates.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.820
Like maybe they're right.

26:45.820 --> 26:46.900
Maybe this is above our pay grade.

26:46.900 --> 26:50.300
And then we can move to the city and ban silk cocaine.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.300
That's a dumb idea.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.300
Nobody would do that.

26:52.300 --> 26:57.740
I mean, that's, yeah, that's kind of what I'm getting at is, I mean, if they are a helpful

26:57.740 --> 27:00.620
source and maybe, yeah, that they solve some shit for us.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.620
Yeah.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.620
Well, I mean, let's do it.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.340
We've made awful decisions up to this point.

27:04.340 --> 27:05.340
So.

27:05.340 --> 27:06.340
Oh, I have made awful decisions.

27:06.340 --> 27:07.340
Keith, you're right.

27:07.340 --> 27:12.260
We've all made pretty awful choices and yeah, if we can like present this as a token of

27:12.260 --> 27:15.780
our good will to these people, throw them a bone.

27:15.780 --> 27:18.300
Maybe they take this whole fucking mess off our shoulders.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.300
I like it.

27:19.300 --> 27:23.500
Well, I'll put it in the trunk tomorrow when they're here, I'll, I'll come in and be like,

27:23.500 --> 27:25.740
Hey, did, do you know who's this is?

27:25.740 --> 27:27.460
Somebody left it or how should I present it?

27:27.460 --> 27:28.860
You could say you found it at John's house.

27:28.860 --> 27:29.860
Yeah.

27:29.860 --> 27:30.860
Okay.

27:30.860 --> 27:31.860
Oh yeah.

27:31.860 --> 27:32.860
I found this at John's house.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.860
I just, it's just been in my cruiser.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.580
It's been in the back of my trunk for a couple of days.

27:36.580 --> 27:39.340
So I'm going to head off to Maggie's house.

27:39.340 --> 27:40.340
Sounds good.

27:40.340 --> 27:44.020
And the other two of you are going and taking the stuff to your respective homes.

27:44.460 --> 27:44.960
All right.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.460
If I could have the two of you leave this room now.

27:56.140 --> 27:59.900
Keith Vigna, you pull up to the chief's house.

27:59.900 --> 28:03.380
I'm trying to think of when I had you lose another, go ahead and lose another willpower

28:03.380 --> 28:04.380
point for me.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.380
Okay.

28:05.380 --> 28:06.380
So you're at six.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.380
Yeah.

28:07.380 --> 28:08.380
You pull up.

28:08.380 --> 28:11.220
It is a nice old brick house in the style of ranch.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.400
There's one door in the front.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.640
There's like a big window in front of the patio that is out front.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.720
It's one story.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.720
Pretty nice place.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.460
But the chief's cruiser is actually parked in the driveway, which as you know, it hasn't

28:24.460 --> 28:27.640
been since she left on the night of December 1st.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.960
You also see Drew's car there.

28:28.960 --> 28:29.960
Oh yeah.

28:29.960 --> 28:30.960
I was going to ask, what does Drew drive?

28:30.960 --> 28:31.960
Just a car?

28:31.960 --> 28:32.960
Yeah.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
What does Drew drive?

28:33.960 --> 28:37.720
Since he works all the time, he probably has quite a bit of money, so probably a mini Cooper.

28:37.720 --> 28:38.720
Yes.

28:38.720 --> 28:39.720
Yes.

28:39.720 --> 28:40.880
That is precisely correct.

28:40.880 --> 28:46.680
He drives a very clean mini Cooper and it is red with a black stripe.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
Yep.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
Dope.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.680
So that is out front as well.

28:49.680 --> 28:50.680
What would you like to do?

28:50.680 --> 28:51.680
I don't want to pull into the driveway.

28:51.680 --> 28:56.960
I want to pull like off to the side of the road in front of the house and go up and knock

28:56.960 --> 28:57.960
on the door.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.880
As you knock on the door, the door swings open.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.520
It wasn't closed completely.

29:04.520 --> 29:08.100
And as it opens, it stops short.

29:08.100 --> 29:12.600
Like it can't open fully with you just pushing at it.

29:12.600 --> 29:19.680
You kind of look around the corner and you see there are two unconscious men on the ground.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.680
Are the lights on?

29:20.680 --> 29:27.020
The lights are not on, but these two unconscious men, one of them is Drew Andrews and it smells

29:27.020 --> 29:28.220
like poop.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.120
If I flip the switch, do the lights come on?

29:30.120 --> 29:31.120
Yes.

29:31.120 --> 29:35.280
When you do flip the switch, you see that in the living room, which is just adjacent

29:35.280 --> 29:41.040
to the foyer, Chief Maggie Cook's body in full uniform leans slumped against the wall

29:41.040 --> 29:42.520
on the other side of the room.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.240
A large chef's knife rests in her left hand.

29:46.240 --> 29:51.760
Her face has been stabbed repeatedly and her left foot is missing.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.840
Blood was clearly flowing rapidly from there.

29:54.840 --> 29:59.360
And as you push your way further into the room, it smells like gasoline and natural

29:59.360 --> 30:00.360
gas in here.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.240
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.040
Forty on a forty.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.800
Ooh, congratulations.

30:06.800 --> 30:07.800
Sweet.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.600
You only lose one upon seeing this because of your success?

30:11.600 --> 30:12.600
What do you want to do?

30:12.600 --> 30:16.600
If I look at that other body, is it Maggie Cook's dad or can I identify the other male

30:16.600 --> 30:17.600
body?

30:17.600 --> 30:24.900
The other male body is an odd looking little man with round glasses on a fat face with

30:24.900 --> 30:26.760
no hair and no chin.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.040
Is he alive or dead?

30:28.040 --> 30:29.040
They're both alive.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.040
Okay.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.200
Two pockets for an ID.

30:31.200 --> 30:38.320
Yeah, you rifle through his pants and you find a wallet with an ID for a Harold Dorsey.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.160
Okay, I immediately go to the kitchen and shut the burners off.

30:42.160 --> 30:48.080
As you walk into the kitchen, you see an unkempt man at the table hunched over with a fork

30:48.080 --> 30:51.240
in one hand and a pistol in the other.

30:51.240 --> 30:56.820
A bullet hole in his head has left him face down in a plate of meat.

30:56.820 --> 30:59.600
His left foot is also missing.

30:59.600 --> 31:04.160
It smells like natural gas, like crazy in here, as well as gasoline, which makes sense

31:04.160 --> 31:09.080
because there are gas cans sitting all over the place and gas has clearly been poured

31:09.080 --> 31:10.620
on everything.

31:10.620 --> 31:16.080
The range has a skillet on it with the leftovers of two feet that have had the meat pulled

31:16.080 --> 31:17.560
from them.

31:17.560 --> 31:22.300
All four burners are turned all the way up and as you go to turn the burners off, I need

31:22.300 --> 31:24.840
you to roll sanity for what you just saw.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.060
87 on a 39.

31:27.060 --> 31:32.940
So go ahead and roll a, we're gonna do a D6 plus two.

31:32.940 --> 31:34.580
That's four plus two is six.

31:34.580 --> 31:39.540
Nice, so you lose six sanity, which puts you down at 33.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.500
Puts you down at 33.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.500
The breaking point of 30, correct, rapidly approaching.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.740
And as you do that- Do I successfully turn the burners off?

31:48.740 --> 31:54.380
So you're trying, but because of what you just saw, maybe you have a different reaction?

31:54.380 --> 31:58.060
So in the course of walking in here, I've lost seven sanity.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.060
Is that right?

31:59.060 --> 32:00.060
Yep.

32:00.060 --> 32:01.060
So you're losing your fucking mind.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.060
Yeah.

32:02.060 --> 32:05.660
I'm going to say like, I probably am going to throw up and then I'm, what do you think?

32:05.660 --> 32:11.540
You throw up all over the kitchen floor and as you do, you fall to your hands and knees

32:11.540 --> 32:18.200
and your left hand, your left hand hits a wire and you know immediately what you've

32:18.200 --> 32:24.140
done because you hear a click off to the side of the room at the front door, the entrance.

32:24.140 --> 32:31.580
You see a trap has clearly been set and you just fell right into it.

32:31.580 --> 32:37.980
A fire starts right at the front door and there's clearly a gasoline lead path that

32:37.980 --> 32:44.180
is leading, going to lead the fire back to this back room filled with natural gas.

32:44.180 --> 32:45.180
What do you do?

32:45.180 --> 32:46.180
I'm on my hands and knees.

32:46.180 --> 32:47.180
Yep.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.500
I look up, I'm looking at the stove.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.500
Yep.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.060
There's a fire extinguisher there, right?

32:51.060 --> 32:52.060
Yeah.

32:52.060 --> 32:58.000
And then I grab it, stand up and start fire extinguishing at the flames while I'm running

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
out the door.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
Okay.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.660
So the flames are leading from the door into the kitchen with all the gas and stuff.

33:04.660 --> 33:08.580
I'm going to take the fire extinguisher, run out of the kitchen, aim it at the closest

33:08.580 --> 33:15.900
part of the fire to me and try to do that all along and then get out of there cause

33:15.900 --> 33:18.140
I don't want to fucking blow up.

33:18.140 --> 33:19.140
Yeah.

33:19.140 --> 33:20.140
That sounds good.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.940
So you're interested in role firefighting for me.

33:21.940 --> 33:22.940
I'm just kidding.

33:22.940 --> 33:25.860
Uh, do you have a skill that would help you in this endeavor?

33:25.860 --> 33:30.140
Do you think I've got a 60 decks, 50 athletics.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.900
Let's do an average of your dexterity and intelligence.

33:32.900 --> 33:34.860
Quick little average of those 55.

33:34.860 --> 33:35.860
Yeah.

33:35.860 --> 33:37.740
So roll against that 55 71.

33:37.740 --> 33:38.740
Okay.

33:38.740 --> 33:39.740
Awesome.

33:39.740 --> 33:44.020
And he's a different, I grabbed some new dice.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.020
Try Joe's.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.420
His seemed to be working really well.

33:46.420 --> 33:47.900
Well, I already rolled that.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.560
Yeah, no, you fucked that up.

33:49.560 --> 33:56.960
So you grab the fire extinguisher and slip on your own vomit as you, as you get up and

33:56.960 --> 34:02.720
are trying to wildly spray this, this fire extinguisher at the fire and then get out

34:02.720 --> 34:03.720
of there.

34:03.720 --> 34:09.880
So as you are running out, you have to jump over the two unconscious men.

34:09.880 --> 34:15.120
So as you are jumping over them to leave this house that is going to explode, what do you

34:15.120 --> 34:16.120
do?

34:16.120 --> 34:18.160
I grabbed Drew and try to pull him out with me.

34:18.160 --> 34:20.680
Full strength for me.

34:20.680 --> 34:22.680
That's a 34 on a 55.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.240
That is a success.

34:24.240 --> 34:25.240
Yay.

34:25.240 --> 34:26.240
Finally.

34:26.240 --> 34:29.800
Uh, do you want to narrate it?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.320
I slip on my vomit.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.320
So now I'm covered in my vomit and probably some blood from that guy's foot.

34:34.320 --> 34:39.560
I get up, I'm spraying the fire extinguisher all over in that room and on the trail of

34:39.560 --> 34:40.560
gasoline.

34:40.560 --> 34:44.480
I jump over and I'm spraying the fire and I realized who I just jumped over.

34:44.480 --> 34:48.400
I look at both the unconscious guys on the ground, realize I don't know who that other

34:48.400 --> 34:53.400
guy is, but I know that this is Drew and as much shit as we give Drew, we need him.

34:53.400 --> 34:59.160
And I put my arms underneath his armpits and just pull as hard as I can until I get out

34:59.160 --> 35:04.580
of the front door and I trip back over myself off the front porch and kind of fling Drew

35:04.580 --> 35:06.160
and fall on my back.

35:06.200 --> 35:14.800
As the house turns into dust, just fucking explodes, bad boys 2 mansion style.

35:14.800 --> 35:21.240
You guys go flying into the yard and smoke immediately starts billowing and you can hear

35:21.240 --> 35:28.240
the ringing of your ears underscored by the wood that was once the chief's house.

35:28.240 --> 35:32.280
As I look at that, after the explosion it kind of knocked me back and knocked me out

35:32.280 --> 35:35.040
and I've just, I'm out for a little while.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.040
Yeah, probably, yeah.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.600
I want to like come to in, you know, half an hour.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
Okay.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.440
Sounds good for the sake of the story.

35:43.440 --> 35:53.040
As Keith closes his eyes, laying back on the front lawn, you're suddenly standing in your

35:53.040 --> 35:54.660
childhood home.

35:54.660 --> 35:59.160
It's your birthday and your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow

35:59.160 --> 36:01.220
out the candles on your cake.

36:01.220 --> 36:05.620
You look up and you see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother.

36:05.620 --> 36:10.860
You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do, you see that

36:10.860 --> 36:14.300
black shiny viscous sludge.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.080
Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies.

36:17.080 --> 36:21.660
Their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them, but the struggle

36:21.660 --> 36:23.860
does not last long.

36:23.860 --> 36:29.780
Their limbs seem to fold into this ooze, becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that is

36:29.780 --> 36:33.600
now sliding across the ground toward you, opening your eyes.

36:33.600 --> 36:38.740
You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you.

36:38.740 --> 36:40.660
The candles are still lit.

36:40.660 --> 36:46.140
You look up and your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter.

36:46.140 --> 36:48.940
You look at the cake and it is gone.

36:48.940 --> 36:53.860
You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece

36:53.860 --> 36:54.860
of cake.

36:54.860 --> 36:59.180
They are all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you.

36:59.180 --> 37:03.900
Beans, beans, Keith, beans, his only friends are figurines.

37:03.900 --> 37:11.440
Beans, beans, Keith, beans, we'll blow your friends to smithereens.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.460
And maybe I'll edit that so that there's multiple voices.

37:14.460 --> 37:15.460
Yeah, you should.

37:15.460 --> 37:19.640
Your parents look at you disgusted and turn and walk out of the room.

37:19.640 --> 37:24.740
You run to follow them, but looking ahead, you only see that woman dressed in old-timey

37:24.740 --> 37:26.420
clothing.

37:26.420 --> 37:30.740
Sitting down, you fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold,

37:30.740 --> 37:32.300
dark room.

37:32.300 --> 37:38.840
The lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos standing

37:38.840 --> 37:42.260
right before you is yourself.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.140
You walk up to you.

37:44.140 --> 37:50.760
The face of the other you begins to age rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse.

37:50.760 --> 37:55.640
You walk up to one of the massive tanks in this massive, dank, dimly lit room.

37:55.640 --> 38:02.320
You press your face against it to see its contents and something creeps toward you.

38:02.320 --> 38:10.120
And as it is about to come into focus, you wake up to the sound of sirens, their firefighters

38:10.120 --> 38:25.240
running all around and it is a scene in the front yard of Chief Maggie Cook's home.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.440
Did you pass a roll with those dice?

38:26.440 --> 38:30.980
I passed a roll with those dice and all my other ones were with those and I did not pass

38:30.980 --> 38:31.980
the rolls with those.

38:31.980 --> 38:34.720
So I decided that these are going to be the ones I use for now.

38:34.720 --> 38:43.380
Okay, so Clark and John, you are a fair amount into unloading the stuff into your homes.

38:43.380 --> 38:46.420
I need you to both lose a willpower point for me.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.800
God damn it, Luke.

38:48.800 --> 38:56.080
As you are just about finished unloading, you still not finished either one of you,

38:56.080 --> 39:05.780
you both receive word that the Chief's home has exploded and is on fire.

39:05.780 --> 39:09.920
Your presence has been requested at the location.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.480
Clark is just too sleepy and he goes to bed.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.600
I'm kidding, I go.

39:15.600 --> 39:24.520
Well, that was good, that was like, John was just going to ignore it.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.520
John is going to...

39:26.520 --> 39:29.400
You are welcome to do whatever you would like to do.

39:29.400 --> 39:33.640
He's going to take a little pinky of that nose candy.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.640
Get a little boost.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.640
And then go to sleep.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.640
And then go out.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.320
Gotta tuck the baby in.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.280
So I understand that improves my willpower?

39:42.280 --> 39:44.720
Yes, you get a plus one to willpower.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.380
That worth it.

39:47.380 --> 39:49.600
You took a baby, you took a baby rip.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.360
Okay, he takes a bigger one.

39:51.360 --> 39:53.600
Okay, you get two willpower points back.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.880
On top of the one I already had?

39:54.880 --> 39:55.880
No.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.880
Okay, then he does another one.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.480
Okay, you've got three willpower points back.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.680
All right, I'm feeling good.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.800
You're at 11 out of 12 willpower.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.480
I feel almost perfect.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.800
You are riding high.

40:08.800 --> 40:13.040
Does anybody just want to get on the radio and just chat, just talk?

40:13.040 --> 40:14.040
Just rap.

40:14.040 --> 40:18.400
Just rap.

40:18.400 --> 40:28.240
As you arrive at the scene of the situation, the home of Chief Maggie Cook is mostly embers

40:28.240 --> 40:36.140
and there are multiple fire trucks and ambulances out in front of the home.

40:36.140 --> 40:43.800
The chief's cruiser is parked in the driveway of the home, as is Drew Andrews' red with

40:43.800 --> 40:51.920
a black stripe Mini Cooper is in front of the home, as is Keith's cruiser.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.300
When you walk up to the scene, you see Keith is sitting in the back of one of the ambulances

40:56.300 --> 41:08.160
with a blanket around him and Drew is in a different ambulance in the back of it with

41:08.160 --> 41:09.960
a blanket wrapped around him.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.520
He's got a little cup of hot cocoa.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.800
Guys, what's going on?

41:12.800 --> 41:13.800
What happened here?

41:13.800 --> 41:17.680
Yeah, I go walk on up to Keith.

41:17.680 --> 41:21.680
Their feet were missing.

41:21.680 --> 41:28.640
Their feet and the burners, they ate the feet.

41:28.640 --> 41:32.000
They ate their feet and Maggie.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.720
Did you see Maggie?

41:34.720 --> 41:39.740
They stabbed her and cut her foot off.

41:39.740 --> 41:43.340
They stabbed her in the face and cut her foot off and they ate it.

41:43.340 --> 41:44.340
Who did that, Keith?

41:44.340 --> 41:45.340
I don't know.

41:45.340 --> 41:46.340
Is she alive?

41:46.340 --> 41:47.340
No.

41:47.340 --> 41:48.340
Her and the other two died.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.260
Who are the other two?

41:51.260 --> 41:55.340
The guy with the fork and the guy I have.

41:55.340 --> 41:57.420
I slap Keith a couple times.

41:57.420 --> 42:01.820
I pull an ID out of my pocket and I hand it to John.

42:01.820 --> 42:05.440
That was the unconscious guy and then I don't know who the other two.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.280
The ID is for a Harold Dorsey.

42:08.280 --> 42:14.600
He's an odd looking little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no

42:14.600 --> 42:15.600
chin.

42:15.600 --> 42:19.860
Hey, can we reload a quick save and instead of doing any of that sting shit, go check

42:19.860 --> 42:22.880
on the chief's house?

42:22.880 --> 42:25.960
Say about like 1 a.m.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.280
Go talk to Drew.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.000
I need to sit, lay down.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Okay.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
I go walk on over to Drew.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
Hey, Drew.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
Hey, Clark.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Can you tell me what happened here tonight?

42:38.000 --> 42:41.960
Um, chief is dead.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.240
Chief is, chief is dead.

42:44.240 --> 42:47.320
Keith saved my life.

42:47.320 --> 42:51.760
And he just breaks down and starts crying in a pretty funny whimper.

42:51.760 --> 42:55.760
I put a hand on his shoulder.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.120
All right, Drew.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.120
All right.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.120
That's okay.

42:59.120 --> 43:02.200
Sounds like you had a rough night.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.760
Can you tell me how Maggie died?

43:04.760 --> 43:06.400
Her face was stabbed.

43:07.120 --> 43:15.040
There was blood all over her face and her foot was gone and I just threw up and passed

43:15.040 --> 43:17.480
out immediately.

43:17.480 --> 43:20.600
I couldn't do anything to stop that.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.680
Drew, it's not your fault, man.

43:22.680 --> 43:25.680
How'd you know to come out here?

43:25.680 --> 43:35.640
Harold Dorsey came and said that he needed to go see her, that she said to be there.

43:36.040 --> 43:40.360
So I wanted to go with him because you told me to look for her.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.880
Hey man, you did a great job.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.640
I found her, but she's dead.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
Sure.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.040
Sometimes that happens in life.

43:48.040 --> 43:50.840
The thing you're looking for is just dead when you find it.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.320
Who's Harold Dorsey?

43:52.320 --> 43:53.320
Is he okay?

43:53.320 --> 43:57.200
Did he make it out?

43:57.200 --> 44:01.440
You know, I haven't, I'm going to go check on him for you real quick, but, but who, can

44:01.440 --> 44:02.920
you tell us who he is first of all?

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
How do you know him?

44:03.920 --> 44:07.600
He works for the newspaper in the city.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.600
He's a reporter?

44:08.600 --> 44:11.600
He's a reporter.

44:11.600 --> 44:25.720
I know you're real emotional, but you're sounding more bratty than sad.

44:25.720 --> 44:32.640
She came to the department and he said that I was supposed to let him borrow the keys

44:32.640 --> 44:36.280
to her house, but I didn't think that was very safe.

44:36.280 --> 44:42.800
And I didn't want him to see the Jacob's cat man thing.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.800
So I just went with him.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.360
Did he see any of the stuff we took out of that storage locker?

44:47.360 --> 44:48.360
No.

44:48.360 --> 44:49.360
Storage lockers?

44:49.360 --> 44:50.360
No.

44:50.360 --> 44:51.360
Okay.

44:51.360 --> 44:52.360
Did you see who stabbed her in the face?

44:52.360 --> 44:58.480
No, she was dead when we got there and we both just, neither one of us could take it.

44:58.480 --> 45:05.000
We both passed out and what, what room of the house was she in?

45:05.000 --> 45:07.520
She was in the living room that was right there in the front.

45:07.520 --> 45:13.160
We, we must've gone unconscious as soon as we saw the blood and it smelled like gas.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.920
I can't believe we didn't die.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.920
Yeah.

45:15.920 --> 45:16.920
How did you get out of there?

45:16.920 --> 45:17.920
You said Keith saved you.

45:17.920 --> 45:18.920
What, what happened?

45:18.920 --> 45:21.000
They said Keith pulled when they got here.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.560
I was on top of Keith in the front yard.

45:23.560 --> 45:27.440
I think he pulled me out as the house exploded.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.680
Was the house on fire when you got here?

45:29.680 --> 45:32.320
No, but it smelled like gas.

45:32.320 --> 45:35.040
Someone started the fire with you two inside.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.040
Yeah.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.800
Did you see any other vehicles or tracks on your way up here?

45:39.800 --> 45:40.800
No.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.800
Okay.

45:41.800 --> 45:45.720
At this point I, I'm kind of coming to and I look over and I see that Drew has some hot

45:45.720 --> 45:46.720
cocoa.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.960
So I look at my EMT guys.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.640
I'm like, Hey guys, can I have some hot cocoa please?

45:51.640 --> 45:52.640
Oh yeah, sir.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.400
I can get you some hot cocoa.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.400
Thanks.

45:56.400 --> 46:00.200
And then he unzips his pants.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.640
That's a, it's like a soft server.

46:02.640 --> 46:09.000
I thought you were a surfer from your voice, but oh, it all stays in now.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Okay.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.960
I don't know about dicks.

46:14.960 --> 46:21.400
I don't know what porn I look at based on the dick and the porn.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.400
I don't.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.920
I categorize it by the drapes.

46:25.440 --> 46:30.440
No drapes or drapes.

46:30.440 --> 46:31.440
Okay.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.440
What kind of porn do you have?

46:32.440 --> 46:34.440
Oh, I've got no drape porn and drape porn.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.920
I do.

46:56.920 --> 47:06.920
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

47:08.920 --> 47:12.920
Cause nobody knows.

47:12.920 --> 47:20.920
Nobody knows.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.920
Yeah.
