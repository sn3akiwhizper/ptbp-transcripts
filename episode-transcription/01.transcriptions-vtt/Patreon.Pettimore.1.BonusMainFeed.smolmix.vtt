00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
Hello, good friends of the podcast called Pretending To Be People.

00:06.360 --> 00:13.760
It is the wolf, the dog, w-wolf the dog, with a special announcement this fine morn-vening.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.040
You may have noticed that this here episode is not episode 26 of season 2.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.880
In fact, it ain't even part of this here campaign.

00:23.880 --> 00:29.280
We'll be back in a couple weeks to pick up where we left off with the very precarious

00:29.280 --> 00:33.520
situations we last left Julius Beck and Cal.

00:33.520 --> 00:44.360
But for now, it's a b-b-b-b-bonus episode from over on P-P-P-P-P-P-Patreon.

00:44.360 --> 00:51.600
In this premium, exclusive content from our contention-confidential feed is the episode

00:51.600 --> 00:59.320
one of a six-part series that Thomas has entitled, The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

00:59.320 --> 01:06.600
That's right, Thomas is the GM, and he's running a story set in the holler outside of contention

01:06.600 --> 01:11.200
following the events of season one of Pretending To Be People.

01:11.200 --> 01:17.480
So if you haven't listened to season one, my delectable listeners, now is the time to

01:17.480 --> 01:24.200
go back to where it all started, because there's, uh, spoilers and such in this ish.

01:24.200 --> 01:30.280
Now if you have listened through season one, then boy oh boy, you are ready for what we've

01:30.280 --> 01:38.080
been calling the Oops All Pettymores campaign, because Joe, Luke, and Zatch are all playing

01:38.080 --> 01:44.280
members of the extended Pettymore family, and let me tell y'all the what, it's been

01:44.280 --> 01:47.080
so got darn fun.

01:47.080 --> 01:54.640
Just five dollars over at patreon.com slash pretending pod will unlock the saga that follows,

01:54.640 --> 01:59.000
as well as the 30-something bonus episodes that came before.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.240
Now I'm not saying you need the bonus content, but I am saying that if you did need all this

02:06.240 --> 02:13.320
bonus content, it's just five bucks to get what you need, and fittingly, Wolf is here

02:13.320 --> 02:21.080
to provide an all-new, all-banging theme, provided by one of Joe's dad's bands.

02:21.080 --> 02:43.200
It's the Morels with Get What You Need.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.280
I need a boat.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.440
I need a plane.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
I need a car.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
I need a train.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
I need a pill.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
I need a drink.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.440
I need a smoke.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.440
I need a drink.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.440
I need an eight-foot couch and a four-foot screen.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.440
A big vacation and a dog that's mean.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.440
I need a four-wheel drive and a three-piece suit.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.440
A nine-millimeter that I know I can shoot.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.680
In the USA, it's not a question of greed.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.680
Cause everybody who is anybody agrees.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.680
For followers the ones who lead.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.680
You get what you need.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.680
Brad's Monkey.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
Are you ready?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
I'm ready.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.680
Five, four, three, two.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.680
Brad's Monkey!

03:38.920 --> 03:40.920
The Funky Monkey!

03:40.920 --> 03:42.920
Brad's Monkey Monkey!

03:42.920 --> 03:44.920
The Funky Monkey!

03:44.920 --> 03:46.920
Blam!

03:46.920 --> 03:50.920
Welcome to the Danov Show!

03:50.920 --> 03:53.920
Welcome to the Danov Show!

03:53.920 --> 04:00.920
For episode 39 of the Patreon, which is a very fucking special episode.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.920
Is it not, Luke?

04:02.920 --> 04:03.920
It is.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.920
The title of this one is, remind me, Thomas?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
The Hunt.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.160
No.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.160
The Lost Treasure of John Lee Treasuremore.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.160
The Lost Treasure of John Lee Treasuremore.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.160
The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.160
Episode 1, Bad Blood.

04:24.160 --> 04:31.160
Where we will be all playing Pettymore cousins or uncles or brothers or whatever it is.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.160
You're all cousins to somebody.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.160
The working title in all of my notes is Oops All Pettymores.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
Oops All Pettymores.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Exactly.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.400
So I think the Pettymores cousins are going to go on a treasure hunt.

04:43.400 --> 04:50.400
But see, it's Thomas' job now, thank God, it's not my job for this one.

04:50.400 --> 04:56.400
It's Thomas' job to make it serious and call episodes bad blood.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.400
And it's up to us to say, Oops All Pettymores!

04:59.400 --> 05:05.400
Well, I did want to say, while tonight we'll be searching for treasure, you can find treasure,

05:05.640 --> 05:09.640
especially for the holiday season, at Target.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.640
Target is the best destination for treasure.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.640
That bit hasn't come out yet.

05:12.640 --> 05:13.640
It hasn't come out yet.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.640
You're right, this is a sneak peek.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.640
It's a preview bit.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.640
And it's real too.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.640
So guys, go shop at Target.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.640
That is what you get here in the Dennis Inn.

05:22.640 --> 05:27.640
That's a bit from an episode we recorded yesterday, last night.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.640
So it's some pretty fresh stuff for you.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.640
Some pretty hot sauce.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.640
Bleeding edge.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.880
Right off the lips of Luke.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.880
We asked for some sins in the chat.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.880
And I saw one that, it's already scrolled past now, but I had to mention it.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.880
I think it was Zach said, that's a different Zach.

05:43.880 --> 05:44.880
What did I say?

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
A different Zach.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.880
Zach with a K.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.880
Said that he accidentally put laxative in his boss's coffee.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.880
I think that might take a week.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
Whoa!

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
Accidentally?

05:56.880 --> 05:58.880
What were they putting in their box's coffee?

05:58.880 --> 06:01.880
An accident isn't a sin unless you don't apologize.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.120
What if you don't need to apologize?

06:05.120 --> 06:07.120
Like this one?

06:07.120 --> 06:10.120
Because what's he going to do?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
Apologize?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
You make fun of him.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.120
There's a lot to take into account here.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.120
How much does your boss hate shitting?

06:16.120 --> 06:19.120
How much do you need your job?

06:19.120 --> 06:22.120
How much do you personally value honesty as an individual?

06:22.120 --> 06:25.120
How much is that going to eat you up?

06:25.120 --> 06:29.120
Are you the kind of person who, if you know you have to lie to your boss

06:29.120 --> 06:31.120
about the fact that you made him shit his pants?

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
Every day for the rest of your life until you die

06:33.360 --> 06:35.360
because there won't be retirement for us.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
Exactly.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.360
Is that going to fuck with you?

06:38.360 --> 06:43.360
One day you guys are sharing what the worst thing that ever happened to you was

06:43.360 --> 06:48.360
and he was like, it was probably that time I shit my pants at work.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.360
What about you?

06:50.360 --> 06:52.360
That's when you tell him.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.360
Honestly, it was the day that I accidentally gave you laxative

06:56.360 --> 07:00.360
and then I saw you shit your pants at work.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.600
So if that would eat you up, just get it over with.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
Get it over with?

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
Were there any other good...

07:07.600 --> 07:09.600
I was setting this up.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.600
I read the Brad's Monkey thing and then I kind of missed all of it.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.600
There's somebody talking about that they found this cheap beer

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
called Montucky Cold Snacks

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
and just the name alone makes me want to taste it.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.600
Have you not had it?

07:20.600 --> 07:24.600
Totoro's Bang Bus has been recruiting people for a year

07:24.600 --> 07:27.600
to drink it because it makes really good Brad's Monkeys.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.840
Brad's Monkey.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.840
That funky monkey.

07:31.840 --> 07:37.840
Montucky Cold Snacks is well distributed here in our hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.840
I feel like it's at every bar.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.840
Every bar?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.840
Is it in a grocery store where I've seen the cans before?

07:43.840 --> 07:45.840
I don't go to that section.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.840
It's like blue with a horse on it.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.840
I haven't seen it, I don't think.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.840
It looks like a retro NBA jersey.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.840
I'll pick some up next time.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.840
It does.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.080
What else?

07:59.080 --> 08:02.080
It looks like if they made Outrun Horse Show.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.080
Uh huh.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.080
What's an Outrun Horse Show?

08:06.080 --> 08:08.080
Come on down!

08:08.080 --> 08:10.080
See if you can outrun this horse!

08:10.080 --> 08:12.080
No, it's like Knight Rider, but a horse.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.080
The horse always wins.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.080
Yeah, every time!

08:16.080 --> 08:18.080
Who's faster than a horse?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.080
It's Knight Rider, but it's a talking horse.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.080
Back in the day, they used to do

08:22.080 --> 08:24.080
radio plays that had Superman

08:24.080 --> 08:26.080
racing the Flash

08:26.320 --> 08:28.320
And what I understand, Superman always won

08:28.320 --> 08:30.320
and I always think that that sucks because

08:30.320 --> 08:32.320
he does all the other things

08:32.320 --> 08:34.320
The Flash has one thing and it's to be fast

08:34.320 --> 08:36.320
And he's still not the best.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.320
And if he loses to Superman, that's just sad.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.320
That's such a bummer for him.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.320
Man, if you had that kind of power, wouldn't you become

08:42.320 --> 08:44.320
I don't know, an authoritarian fascist

08:44.320 --> 08:46.320
or just indifferent?

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
That might be interesting to explore.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.320
That kind of Superman.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.320
Has anybody ever done a bad Superman?

08:52.320 --> 08:54.320
Who would try to put him down like some sort of

08:54.320 --> 08:56.320
opposite?

08:56.320 --> 08:58.320
It's probably going to have to be another group of

08:58.320 --> 09:00.320
pretty shrewdly realized superhero

09:00.320 --> 09:02.320
parodies.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.320
No, Rorschach's not pretty.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
Wait, what?

09:06.320 --> 09:08.320
Who are we talking about?

09:08.320 --> 09:10.320
Well, a number of different IPs.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.320
What was that recent one that came out, Bright Something?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.320
Bright?

09:14.320 --> 09:16.320
Where he's a kid?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.320
It was not great, but I liked it.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.320
I haven't seen it, but I remember the whole thing was that

09:20.320 --> 09:22.320
it was bad Superman.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.320
Oh, Hancock.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.320
No.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.320
Yes.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.320
Yeah.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.320
He's right, Joe.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.320
That's hilarious. Brightburn.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.320
Brightburn.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.320
I liked it.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.320
Because it's like, oh, Superman, he's bad,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.320
but what are you going to do?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.320
Evil.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
He's a kid and he's bad.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
Oh, and he can do crazy stuff.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
What are you going to do?

09:50.320 --> 09:52.320
Brightburn.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.320
Yeah, I've got Brightburn.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.320
I'm sorry to hear that, dude.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.320
What are they going to do, though?

09:58.320 --> 10:00.320
You're a kid.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.320
It Brightburns when I pee.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.320
What do we do?

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
Like, neon.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.320
What are you asking?

10:08.320 --> 10:10.320
What do we do?

10:10.320 --> 10:12.320
What do we do?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.320
Yeah, what do we do to get the fire back

10:14.320 --> 10:16.320
within our loins?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.320
They've got pills for that.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.320
An uncle.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.320
LMFAO. Put it on right now.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.320
Loins burning.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.320
It's strange.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.320
They're not that far apart

10:28.320 --> 10:30.320
in age. It's not that weird.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.320
Thomas. Yeah.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
Almost ready. I'm ready.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.320
I'm rearing to go.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.320
I'm ready to play a pettymore

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
for the nth time.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.320
I've never played a pettymore.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.320
Are you excited? Yeah.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.320
How do you get into the mindset of playing a pettymore?

10:46.320 --> 10:48.320
It's a page-long introduction.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.320
Yeah, I saw how long it was.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
You wouldn't let me read it, though.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.320
No, of course not.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.320
Of course not. There's secrets in here

10:56.320 --> 10:58.320
that I don't think you can handle.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.320
I've got my intro in mind, but

11:00.320 --> 11:02.320
unless the story reads it, I think I should go first

11:02.320 --> 11:04.320
so that the more thought-out ones

11:04.320 --> 11:06.320
can go after me.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.320
Yeah, that's why you're going to go second

11:08.320 --> 11:10.320
after Zach.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.320
Actually, we might sandwich Zach.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.320
Luke can go first.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.320
Joe, you told me you literally had dreams

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
about rehearsing yours.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.320
It's not a page-long, is all.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.320
Okay, Luke can go first

11:22.320 --> 11:24.320
and give Zach time to write his.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.320
I'm just looking up the questions you sent.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
I don't know if you're

11:28.320 --> 11:30.320
trying to be me as vengeance

11:30.320 --> 11:32.320
or if we are the same person.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.320
Look on me, look on me.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.320
If it's vengeance, I get it. If it's just you,

11:38.320 --> 11:40.320
then...

11:40.320 --> 11:42.320
Welcome to my life.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.320
Did you get it?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.320
Is that how we're kicking off?

11:46.320 --> 11:48.320
Are we kicking off with all of this?

11:48.320 --> 11:50.320
No, there's some stuff.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.320
Should we get some good intro stuff

11:52.320 --> 11:54.320
about the episode for the Patreon?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.320
Let's get some intro stuff about the episode

11:56.320 --> 11:58.320
for the Patreon.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.320
For them audio listeners.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
Hello audio listeners.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.320
Hello audio listeners.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.320
You guys have missed so much

12:06.320 --> 12:08.320
that we talked about before

12:08.320 --> 12:10.320
in the Patreon.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.320
So go ahead and up those Patreons.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.320
Did you know Chris D'Elia died?

12:14.320 --> 12:16.320
I saw that, dude.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.320
We didn't talk about that on the stream, did we?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.320
No, you gotta explain why you said that

12:22.320 --> 12:24.320
though, because

12:24.320 --> 12:26.320
Joe's over here scrolling

12:26.320 --> 12:28.320
on his phone.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.320
I got the update, I got the CNN update

12:30.320 --> 12:32.320
that Kirstie Alley had passed away

12:32.320 --> 12:34.320
and I said that aloud.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.320
And I really loudly was like

12:36.320 --> 12:38.320
aww.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.320
Which confused Zach.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.320
Because I thought he said that Chris D'Elia died

12:42.320 --> 12:44.320
and then Thomas goes, aww,

12:44.320 --> 12:46.320
oh no.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.320
But like genuinely?

12:48.320 --> 12:50.320
Like someone you cared about

12:50.320 --> 12:52.320
or like cared that they died

12:52.320 --> 12:54.320
and died? Well, you know, when I was younger

12:54.320 --> 12:56.320
I watched that pervert episode of Workaholics

12:56.320 --> 12:58.320
all the time before I went to bed.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.320
No, I did watch Cheers like all the time

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
because it was just on like the nightbox

13:02.320 --> 13:04.320
as I was going

13:04.320 --> 13:06.320
to bed as a young one.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.320
I'm going to rip Kirstie Alley

13:08.320 --> 13:10.320
who will be long dead and decayed

13:10.320 --> 13:12.320
by the time you hear this episode edited

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
as a Patreon listener.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.320
Okay, so what we're doing here tonight

13:16.320 --> 13:18.320
is episode one

13:18.320 --> 13:20.320
of The Lost Treasure of John Lee Pettymore.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.320
It's called Bad Blood.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.320
Bad Blood.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.320
Cause baby now we got

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
bad blood.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.320
And everybody made me mad.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.320
Got it.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.320
Check.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.320
Nailed it. Nailed it.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.320
And what this is is a

13:38.320 --> 13:40.320
an oops all Pettymore arc where

13:40.320 --> 13:42.320
all the boys are going to be playing

13:42.320 --> 13:44.320
family members of

13:44.320 --> 13:46.320
my character John Lee Pettymore

13:46.320 --> 13:48.320
from season one. And we kind of

13:48.320 --> 13:50.320
established during that season that he has a very big

13:50.320 --> 13:52.320
extended family who are

13:52.320 --> 13:54.320
kind of as crazy and wild as him.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.320
Big old wild family out there in contention.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.320
Big old blunts. In the surrounding

13:58.320 --> 14:00.320
areas. Huge

14:00.320 --> 14:02.320
smoking big doinks in Amish.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.320
Big smoking big doinks

14:04.320 --> 14:06.320
in contention.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.320
But we won't be in contention listeners

14:08.320 --> 14:10.320
because some of you might remember

14:10.320 --> 14:12.320
what happened at the end of season one.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.320
Spoilers. Spoilers. Spoilers.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.320
Which is Keith put a big old dome over everything.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.320
And I

14:20.320 --> 14:22.320
after seeing

14:22.320 --> 14:24.320
the beautifully round shape

14:24.320 --> 14:26.320
off riding into the sunset

14:26.320 --> 14:28.320
of Planet Juggernaut

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
he looked at that shape and said

14:30.320 --> 14:32.320
I like that.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.320
Now you know it has deeper roots than that right?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.320
Oh. I thought you did this

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
intentionally but I don't know.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
I was like damn I respect the fuck out of

14:40.320 --> 14:42.320
Luke when I listen to like episode

14:42.320 --> 14:44.320
15 or 16 and

14:44.320 --> 14:46.320
Keith literally says like I'd like to

14:46.320 --> 14:48.320
put a giant

14:48.320 --> 14:50.320
dome over the whole city.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.320
I think it's just something

14:52.320 --> 14:54.320
I think about a lot.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.320
That's just the Luke

14:56.320 --> 14:58.320
preoccupation that you brought into

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
the character.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.320
Which is a great

15:02.320 --> 15:04.320
no it's the who shot Mr. Burns episode.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.320
Oh. Did they do it in the movie too?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.320
I think they did. It was like the whole

15:08.320 --> 15:10.320
point of the movie.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.320
Oh they do a dome in the movie who shot

15:12.320 --> 15:14.320
Mr. Burns he just builds a giant thing

15:14.320 --> 15:16.320
that blocks out the sun.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.320
If you want to block out

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
any one of us your three sons

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
during this episode you can put up your hand

15:22.320 --> 15:24.320
like that in a particular way

15:24.320 --> 15:26.320
in front of that camera that can block

15:26.320 --> 15:28.320
one of us from sight. Yeah.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.320
That's me. I'm gone now.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.320
I was trying to block you all.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.320
That's all of us.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.320
Okay my three sons.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
You're all going to be playing Betty Morris.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.320
I cannot wait.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.320
And times are a little tough for the

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
Betty Morris.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.320
They are not at their full power as you might say.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.320
You all are friends of

15:50.320 --> 15:52.320
Jon in the way that cousins

15:52.320 --> 15:54.320
often are. Some of you

15:54.320 --> 15:56.320
are a little older. One of you is

15:56.320 --> 15:58.320
pretty much right at Jon's age.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.320
But he's been missing for a year at this point.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.320
He's not the only

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
anymore missing.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.320
Don D. Pettymore is gone.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.320
Jimmy Sanders is gone.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.320
There's some talk about

16:10.320 --> 16:12.320
Aloysius

16:12.320 --> 16:14.320
and Edward. Some sort

16:14.320 --> 16:16.320
of foul play that might have happened involving

16:16.320 --> 16:18.320
Jon but nobody really knows. You've only

16:18.320 --> 16:20.320
heard rumors. And

16:20.320 --> 16:22.320
when you were all growing up you would come

16:22.320 --> 16:24.320
to Pettymore Holler at least

16:24.320 --> 16:26.320
every year if you didn't actually

16:26.320 --> 16:28.320
live there for the big family cookout.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
A huge Pettymore reunion.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.320
And it's been five or six years since

16:32.320 --> 16:34.320
that's actually been put on.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.320
But this year everybody gets

16:36.320 --> 16:38.320
a call or an email

16:38.320 --> 16:40.320
or a handwritten note from Ma

16:40.320 --> 16:42.320
Pettymore, the family matriarch.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.320
We can work

16:44.320 --> 16:46.320
out family trees and stuff later.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.320
I think even though some of you are older

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
it's plausible you're all

16:50.320 --> 16:52.320
within the same generation of cousins

16:52.320 --> 16:54.320
of Jon. So we're going to say

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
she's your great-great-grandmother.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
We have them young. Yeah, she's like

16:58.320 --> 17:00.320
67.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.320
Wow.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.320
The math on that

17:04.320 --> 17:06.320
is horrible. It sucks.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.320
She's like 77.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.320
97.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.320
She's turning 70.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.320
That's what I wrote

17:14.320 --> 17:16.320
on the Patreon is that it was her 70th birthday.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.320
She's turning 70.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.320
Great-great.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.320
Great-great-grandmother. Okay, she's your great-grandmother.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.320
Okay, that helps

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
a little bit.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.320
Put in a second grade. Make it weird.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.320
No.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.320
She's your great-grandmother and she's called you all here

17:32.320 --> 17:34.320
today for the first Pettymore

17:34.320 --> 17:36.320
cookout, hoedown, get-together,

17:36.320 --> 17:38.320
hootenanny

17:38.320 --> 17:40.320
family reunion that you've had in

17:40.320 --> 17:42.320
five years. And usually this is at

17:42.320 --> 17:44.320
her place. This is at Ma

17:44.320 --> 17:46.320
Pettymore's house, kind of the heart

17:46.320 --> 17:48.320
of all the family property

17:48.320 --> 17:50.320
in Pettymore Haller, which is where

17:50.320 --> 17:52.320
John lives on the edge of.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.320
And the unusual thing about her letter this year is

17:54.320 --> 17:56.320
that it mentions this is going to be at John's

17:56.320 --> 17:58.320
place. She says, it's not just

17:58.320 --> 18:00.320
a birthday celebration. This is

18:00.320 --> 18:02.320
about family, remembering,

18:02.320 --> 18:04.320
and our future. And so

18:04.320 --> 18:06.320
in one way or the other, you all make your way from

18:06.320 --> 18:08.320
wherever it is you live to

18:08.320 --> 18:10.320
John Lee Pettymore's house on the outside

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
of contention. And it's not

18:12.320 --> 18:14.320
really the same as you remember

18:14.320 --> 18:16.320
getting there last time. The Haller itself

18:16.320 --> 18:18.320
is located in between,

18:18.320 --> 18:20.320
um, I've actually got something written

18:20.320 --> 18:22.320
for this. I could just start reading.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.320
Yeah, you should do that.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.320
Do a good voice.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.320
Like Liz.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.320
Welcome to

18:30.320 --> 18:32.320
the puddle.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.320
Do a baby voice.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
The home and property of John Lee Pettymore.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.320
The home and property of

18:38.320 --> 18:40.320
John Lee Pettymore sits just above the cleavage

18:40.320 --> 18:42.320
that separates the two local prominences

18:42.320 --> 18:44.320
known as big and little beans

18:44.320 --> 18:46.320
teat.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.320
A cleavage that, for as long as

18:48.320 --> 18:50.320
anyone can remember, has borne your family's

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
name. Pettymore Haller.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.320
Generations of Pettymores have lived and died

18:54.320 --> 18:56.320
between the teats, tending to the land,

18:56.320 --> 18:58.320
themselves, and generally honoring

18:58.320 --> 19:00.320
the bounty the good Lord has seen fit to bless them

19:00.320 --> 19:02.320
with. That's at least how the Pettymore tells it.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.320
But God doesn't make bras big enough

19:04.320 --> 19:06.320
for mountains.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.320
And you know as well as every outsider

19:08.320 --> 19:10.320
within 50 miles that the Haller

19:10.320 --> 19:12.320
has never truly contained your rowdy,

19:12.320 --> 19:14.320
wild, and extremely prolific

19:14.320 --> 19:16.320
clan. You're all driving.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.320
There's one way into contention, pretty much.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.320
The highway. And

19:20.320 --> 19:22.320
you're driving down some familiar farm

19:22.320 --> 19:24.320
farmland, wide

19:24.320 --> 19:26.320
open spaces. As you get closer to

19:26.320 --> 19:28.320
contention, the land becomes more treed

19:28.320 --> 19:30.320
and hillier. And about 10 miles outside

19:30.320 --> 19:32.320
of town, there is a massive

19:32.320 --> 19:34.320
construction barricade across

19:34.320 --> 19:36.320
the highway, diverting you onto

19:36.320 --> 19:38.320
Farm Road 67.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.320
Damn. Too way.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.320
Just wait.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.320
As you get to that

19:44.320 --> 19:46.320
construction

19:46.320 --> 19:48.320
detour, roll an alertness

19:48.320 --> 19:50.320
check for me.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.320
Ooh. Already rolling.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.320
Right off the bat.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.320
Mine's a fail. Fail.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.320
I pass. 18 on a 50.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.320
Okay, you two grumble a little bit and take the detour.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
But Luke, you

20:02.320 --> 20:04.320
would notice, and we'll get to who you are

20:04.320 --> 20:06.320
in just a second, but you would notice that

20:06.320 --> 20:08.320
pretty much as far as you can see past the

20:08.320 --> 20:10.320
barricades, you don't see any

20:10.320 --> 20:12.320
signs of construction. There's no

20:12.320 --> 20:14.320
equipment. There's no

20:14.320 --> 20:16.320
upturned earth. It just seems like

20:16.320 --> 20:18.320
abandoned highway for as long

20:18.320 --> 20:20.320
as you can see until it disappears kind of

20:20.320 --> 20:22.320
behind the bend and some hills. And

20:22.320 --> 20:24.320
you think that's odd, but you've read about

20:24.320 --> 20:26.320
it being a pretty extensive

20:26.320 --> 20:28.320
project, so maybe it's just further on down

20:28.320 --> 20:30.320
closer to contention itself.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.320
And you all take Farm Road 60

20:32.320 --> 20:34.320
in your own ways.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.320
Through these woody hills,

20:36.320 --> 20:38.320
beautiful picturesque dreams,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.320
gorgeous oaks, mighty

20:40.320 --> 20:42.320
pines, stout

20:42.320 --> 20:44.320
sycamores.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.320
Everything the Ozarks

20:46.320 --> 20:48.320
has to offer, all the natural beauty you

20:48.320 --> 20:50.320
grew up with, or at least spent time

20:50.320 --> 20:52.320
around as children, like to some extent.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.320
And you're actually, you're gonna pass through

20:54.320 --> 20:56.320
Pettymore Hauler itself, on the back way

20:56.320 --> 20:58.320
to John's pretty much. Give me just a second.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.320
I'm liking it. I'm there.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.320
I'm in the hauler. I'm there. I'm a drone right

21:02.320 --> 21:04.320
now. I'm a drone in some cleavage.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.320
In between the teats. I'm a titty fucking

21:06.320 --> 21:08.320
hauler. Hell yeah.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.320
Hey Keith, you're

21:10.320 --> 21:12.320
named after the pair of tits?

21:14.320 --> 21:16.320
No, it's named after me.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.320
You come to the

21:18.320 --> 21:20.320
crossroads of Farm Road 67

21:20.320 --> 21:22.320
and Jiminy Road, which sits

21:22.320 --> 21:24.320
pretty much directly at this

21:24.320 --> 21:26.320
small unincorporated

21:26.320 --> 21:28.320
community known as Jiminy Station.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.320
There's a little gas station

21:30.320 --> 21:32.320
and bed and breakfast there

21:32.320 --> 21:34.320
and a couple of like abandoned

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
mid-century commercial buildings.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.320
You would know that, you know,

21:38.320 --> 21:40.320
if 50 people lived in Jiminy Station

21:40.320 --> 21:42.320
in the 70s, maybe less than

21:42.320 --> 21:44.320
two dozen do now. You take Jiminy

21:44.320 --> 21:46.320
Road past Farm Road 68

21:46.320 --> 21:48.320
to Farm Road 69.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.320
Which leads to the heart of

21:50.320 --> 21:52.320
Pettymore Hauler.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.320
And you see, you see all the ancestral

21:54.320 --> 21:56.320
fiefdom. You see

21:56.320 --> 21:58.320
Ma Pettymore's house.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.320
You see some frankly

22:00.320 --> 22:02.320
less well camped properties.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.320
Sites you're pretty familiar with though.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.320
A lot of pettymoors don't like to get rid of things.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.320
They like to keep them around in case they need them.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.320
So if you prefer that to a yard, you know,

22:10.320 --> 22:12.320
whose business is that but yours?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.320
And when you get to

22:14.320 --> 22:16.320
the gates of John's Farm, you see

22:16.320 --> 22:18.320
the front field is

22:18.320 --> 22:20.320
completely packed with parked

22:20.320 --> 22:22.320
cars. And there's already

22:22.320 --> 22:24.320
a pretty broad gathering.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.320
Dozens and dozens of pettymoors

22:26.320 --> 22:28.320
all around these tables and

22:28.320 --> 22:30.320
Bunch of ladies. Ladies.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.320
Guys. Broad gathering.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.320
Kids. Got it. Oh, broad gathering.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.320
Boom. It's a real broad city.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.320
BC, you see your

22:40.320 --> 22:42.320
whole family there. For the first time in years.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.320
Relatives you haven't seen

22:44.320 --> 22:46.320
since you were small. Some you might have

22:46.320 --> 22:48.320
seen more recently. But everyone is

22:48.320 --> 22:50.320
so happy. Luke, we're gonna do

22:50.320 --> 22:52.320
you first. Okay.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.320
Tell me and then I'll go.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.320
As your character

22:56.320 --> 22:58.320
pulls in to this cookout, you park

22:58.320 --> 23:00.320
and you get out of your car. And who

23:00.320 --> 23:02.320
gets out? Who are you? Where are you from?

23:02.320 --> 23:04.320
Well, why are you here?

23:04.320 --> 23:06.320
Many creatures

23:06.320 --> 23:08.320
are born in and roam the

23:08.320 --> 23:10.320
hollers near contention. Bears,

23:10.320 --> 23:12.320
coyotes, bobcats, and pettymoors live their

23:12.320 --> 23:14.320
entire lives there until they're eaten,

23:14.320 --> 23:16.320
shot, or hit with a truck. The latter two

23:16.320 --> 23:18.320
spell the end of Bernie Pettymore but only

23:18.320 --> 23:20.320
after he fathered his first and only son

23:20.320 --> 23:22.320
Peter Bernard Pettymore. Peter Bernard

23:22.320 --> 23:24.320
Pettymore, known around the hollers as

23:24.320 --> 23:26.320
PDB, was raised by his

23:26.320 --> 23:28.320
was raised by his now single

23:28.320 --> 23:30.320
mother along with plenty of help from

23:30.320 --> 23:32.320
the rest of the Pettymore clan. Upon

23:32.320 --> 23:34.320
graduating high school, a relatively uncommon

23:34.320 --> 23:36.320
accomplishment in his neck of the woods,

23:36.320 --> 23:38.320
Petey left the comfort of the

23:38.320 --> 23:40.320
holler to pursue his dream. Flying.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.320
Peter packed up the few belongings

23:42.320 --> 23:44.320
he had, hitchhiked his way to Colorado,

23:44.320 --> 23:46.320
and joined the United States Air Force

23:46.320 --> 23:48.320
Academy. After four long years of

23:48.320 --> 23:50.320
intensive study and training, Pete joined the

23:50.320 --> 23:52.320
Air Force and at long last took to the

23:52.320 --> 23:54.320
skies. Although a handful of Pettymoors

23:54.320 --> 23:56.320
had taken trips in planes and even more

23:56.320 --> 23:58.320
had conquered the land and sea,

23:58.320 --> 24:00.320
Petey was the first of his name to make a home

24:00.320 --> 24:02.320
in the wild blue yonder. After

24:02.320 --> 24:04.320
fulfilling his duty to the United States military,

24:04.320 --> 24:06.320
Peter set his sights on the final

24:06.320 --> 24:08.320
frontier, Florida. Petey accepted

24:08.320 --> 24:10.320
a position at NASA honing his scientific

24:10.320 --> 24:12.320
skills and offering his perfected

24:12.320 --> 24:14.320
piloting prowess for the furtherance of

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
humanity and safety of the planet.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.320
Pete successfully manned many missions,

24:18.320 --> 24:20.320
retiring with full benefits and the knowledge

24:20.320 --> 24:22.320
that he made a measurable difference.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.320
The stories Pete's friends and family hear about

24:24.320 --> 24:26.320
his tenure at NASA seem exaggerated,

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
outlandish, and often completely

24:28.320 --> 24:30.320
fabricated. But Petey knows

24:30.320 --> 24:32.320
the truth and that's all that matters to him.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.320
I flew a

24:34.320 --> 24:36.320
secret rocket ship to shoot a missile

24:36.320 --> 24:38.320
bomb at a giant accumulation

24:38.320 --> 24:40.320
of space trash that was headed right

24:40.320 --> 24:42.320
for Kilimanjaro.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.320
Would have wiped out the whole eastern hemisphere

24:44.320 --> 24:46.320
but we nailed that sucker and blew

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
it back to Alpha Centauri.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.320
What was some poor alien's fucker's problem

24:50.320 --> 24:52.320
now? When we got home,

24:52.320 --> 24:54.320
I cracked open a little intergalactic

24:54.320 --> 24:56.320
pale ale, which is the secret beer we

24:56.320 --> 24:58.320
brew at NASA. Yep,

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
that was the best beer I ever had.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
What about you? Petey Pettymore takes

25:02.320 --> 25:04.320
a long sip from his Miller Lite and size,

25:04.320 --> 25:06.320
looking over at his conversation partner,

25:06.320 --> 25:08.320
a young disheveled Pettymore boy concentrating

25:08.320 --> 25:10.320
on his Game Boy. Without waiting for a response,

25:10.320 --> 25:12.320
Petey chugs his beer, stands up,

25:12.320 --> 25:14.320
and crushes the beer under his black combat

25:14.320 --> 25:16.320
boots. The camera pans up from the

25:16.320 --> 25:18.320
crushed can and we see a blue jumper

25:18.320 --> 25:20.320
adorned with a NASA patch, an American

25:20.320 --> 25:22.320
flag, and an embroidered

25:22.320 --> 25:24.320
name tag that reads Commander

25:24.320 --> 25:26.320
Petey B. Peteymore. The top of the jumper is

25:26.320 --> 25:28.320
unzipped, revealing a black graphic t-shirt

25:28.320 --> 25:30.320
emblazoned with a cartoon astronaut eating

25:30.320 --> 25:32.320
a peach and the text that says

25:32.320 --> 25:34.320
Eat NASA.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.320
Laughter

25:38.320 --> 25:40.320
Petey runs his hands through his

25:40.320 --> 25:42.320
slick-backed red hair, the sides

25:42.320 --> 25:44.320
still shaven in the military fashion,

25:44.320 --> 25:46.320
but the top long enough to

25:46.320 --> 25:48.320
slick back and settle on his back a few

25:48.320 --> 25:50.320
inches below the shoulders. His piercing

25:50.320 --> 25:52.320
green eyes dart around, searching for a familiar

25:52.320 --> 25:54.320
face in the curious sea of

25:54.320 --> 25:56.320
Pettymores. It's good to be home,

25:56.320 --> 25:58.320
Petey BP says as he turns his

25:58.320 --> 26:00.320
gaze to the sky.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.320
At least for now.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.320
Hey Petey.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.320
Hey there. Hey, it's your

26:06.320 --> 26:08.320
Uncle Ron. Ron, of course.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.320
You remember me? And you

26:10.320 --> 26:12.320
see a very, very

26:12.320 --> 26:14.320
almost impossibly skinny old

26:14.320 --> 26:16.320
man who kind of just comes hobbling

26:16.320 --> 26:18.320
over to you and he's wearing

26:18.320 --> 26:20.320
a camo fatigue vest

26:20.320 --> 26:22.320
and he's got a Vietnam veteran's

26:22.320 --> 26:24.320
cap and he just grins

26:24.320 --> 26:26.320
at you with these yellow teeth

26:26.320 --> 26:28.320
that are, you know, what's left of him and

26:28.320 --> 26:30.320
this huge, huge tobacco-stained

26:30.320 --> 26:32.320
white beard. And he says, Petey, I've been

26:32.320 --> 26:34.320
really wanting to talk to you about

26:34.320 --> 26:36.320
your experiences at NASA.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
Yeah, Ron, I haven't seen you

26:38.320 --> 26:40.320
since I went to space.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.320
Well, since you've seen me, I've been to

26:42.320 --> 26:44.320
space too, my friend.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.320
Really? More than once or twice have the

26:46.320 --> 26:48.320
grays abducted me.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.320
I'd like to pick your brain a little bit about what's

26:50.320 --> 26:52.320
been going on up, you know, up in the

26:52.320 --> 26:54.320
government because they don't answer my letters none.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.320
Well, you know, I'm retired now so I

26:56.320 --> 26:58.320
can mostly just tell you about blowing stuff

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
up in space as far as the

27:00.320 --> 27:02.320
government's concerned. I never saw any aliens.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
Yeah, the official story is

27:04.320 --> 27:06.320
you blew up a ball of trash in space.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.320
But who put it there, man? The aliens!

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
I don't, well, how

27:10.320 --> 27:12.320
about we circle back to this

27:12.320 --> 27:14.320
later. Okay, I will catch

27:14.320 --> 27:16.320
up with you later because I, well, have you heard

27:16.320 --> 27:18.320
from, have you heard from Trey?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.320
Trey wants to talk to you and

27:20.320 --> 27:22.320
some of the others. I haven't seen him yet

27:22.320 --> 27:24.320
but I think you're done with your government work.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.320
You ain't afraid of making a little money,

27:26.320 --> 27:28.320
are you? Well, no, that's, I mean

27:28.320 --> 27:30.320
one reason I tried to move back around here

27:30.320 --> 27:32.320
was, you know, make a little

27:32.320 --> 27:34.320
money and have a little fun. That's good to

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
hear, that's good to hear because I think we can do both.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.320
Okay, well. Trey's gonna fill you

27:38.320 --> 27:40.320
in on more. Okay, I'll go find him.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.320
It was really good to see you, Beatty.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.320
I'm gonna get you to talk. I'm gonna

27:44.320 --> 27:46.320
get you to tell me about them grays.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
Ron, we'll talk about it. So, yeah, Ron

27:48.320 --> 27:50.320
hobbles off to refill his beer.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.320
You wander off to go mingle with the rest of the party

27:52.320 --> 27:54.320
and Joe, you pull up next.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
There's a man already kind of

27:56.320 --> 27:58.320
standing by the keg

27:58.320 --> 28:00.320
and he's got a red solo cup full

28:00.320 --> 28:02.320
and he has a cigarette in his other hand

28:02.320 --> 28:04.320
and he's got a mullet.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.320
It's a gray mullet and the front

28:06.320 --> 28:08.320
of the mullet is feathered out

28:08.320 --> 28:10.320
kind of Rod Stewart style mullet.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.320
Hell yes. And he's wearing these

28:12.320 --> 28:14.320
kind of gaudy big glasses

28:14.320 --> 28:16.320
with a gold rim

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
around the edges. Maybe little circles

28:18.320 --> 28:20.320
embroidering the arms of the

28:20.320 --> 28:22.320
sunglasses. And he's wearing

28:22.320 --> 28:24.320
a cowboy shirt

28:24.320 --> 28:26.320
and it's a white cowboy shirt with white

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
pearl snaps and the filigree on it is

28:28.320 --> 28:30.320
embroidered white. So it's

28:30.320 --> 28:32.320
kind of shimmers in the sun and catches shadows

28:32.320 --> 28:34.320
and it's cut off at the sleeves

28:34.320 --> 28:36.320
and he's got no shirt underneath. It's open.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.320
He's got a big

28:38.320 --> 28:40.320
beer belly hanging out the front

28:40.320 --> 28:42.320
but his legs are like in

28:42.320 --> 28:44.320
skinny jeans. He's kind of

28:44.320 --> 28:46.320
like a rooster looking almost

28:46.320 --> 28:48.320
with his big belly and his swoop

28:48.320 --> 28:50.320
back hair and his rooster legs

28:50.320 --> 28:52.320
is actually a highly desired

28:52.320 --> 28:54.320
trait in a petty more man.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.320
If you can

28:56.320 --> 28:58.320
get them jeans that tight and that.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.320
He's been cultivating the look for a while.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.320
Probably nailed it a long time

29:02.320 --> 29:04.320
ago and stuck with it.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.320
You're

29:06.320 --> 29:08.320
I love you're describing like so

29:08.320 --> 29:10.320
many guys that we used to see at

29:10.320 --> 29:12.320
your dad's shows.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.320
So

29:14.320 --> 29:16.320
the camera kind of zooms in on him and

29:16.320 --> 29:18.320
he's already talking to somebody and he's

29:18.320 --> 29:20.320
saying it's me.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
It's Arlo Pettymore.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
I don't blame it. It's been years. I kind of keep to

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
myself anyways. I'm back there in the

29:26.320 --> 29:28.320
laboratory. I mean yes

29:28.320 --> 29:30.320
it's my shed of course but it's my

29:30.320 --> 29:32.320
laboratory. You probably sampled my

29:32.320 --> 29:34.320
Saturday morning cartoon.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.320
You probably had

29:36.320 --> 29:38.320
a taste of that SMC. That's what the kids

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
were calling these days. People think it's called

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
that because it makes you see Looney Tunes.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
That's not what it's called that.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.320
It's about the ingredients. That's what I make

29:46.320 --> 29:48.320
it out of. I make it out of

29:48.320 --> 29:50.320
it's frosted corn flakes and milk.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.320
And then there's a little gasoline

29:52.320 --> 29:54.320
in there of course. You got to give yourself

29:54.320 --> 29:56.320
a little kick or something there.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.320
I don't mind telling you the recipe

29:58.320 --> 30:00.320
because it's all about the proportions of

30:00.320 --> 30:02.320
them chemicals. That's kind of the whole thing.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
Use chemicals. I use chemicals.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.320
Use all chemicals. It's just a matter of the

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
proportions of them chemicals. It's just something I've always

30:08.320 --> 30:10.320
been able to tell in a person is the chemical makeups

30:10.320 --> 30:12.320
of them. Some people say I'm a genius.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.320
I don't say about myself much though.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.320
But yeah that's that Saturday morning cartoons.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.320
It'll fuck you up for sure. It's real good.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.320
Hey I'm just kind of cooped up in that lab

30:20.320 --> 30:22.320
back there. It's got a cot. It's got a real

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
nice cot. It's one of my favorite cots.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
I bought it myself. Well I didn't

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
buy myself. Ma bought it for me. But it's mine.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.320
She said it's all mine.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.320
You having a

30:32.320 --> 30:34.320
good day? Camera pans down.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.320
It's the same kid that he was

30:36.320 --> 30:38.320
talking to. Yeah that's the game boy.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.320
It's a little kid.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.320
Well I'm going to go see who else

30:42.320 --> 30:44.320
is here today. Okay yeah.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.320
Well it sounds like you really got a lot

30:46.320 --> 30:48.320
going on and I feel like there's a lot of

30:48.320 --> 30:50.320
people here and kids are really

30:50.320 --> 30:52.320
more into like TikToks and

30:52.320 --> 30:54.320
streaming content. I don't think it's like

30:54.320 --> 30:56.320
cartoons have to strictly be on like a

30:56.320 --> 30:58.320
Saturday morning anymore. You can

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
kind of watch it at your own schedule.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.320
But it didn't really sound like you were talking about cartoons.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.320
My mom

31:04.320 --> 31:06.320
said I should meet you. I got to meet all my

31:06.320 --> 31:08.320
else's but I hope you

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
enjoy talking to someone else. Yeah

31:10.320 --> 31:12.320
of course and if you ever want a free sample you

31:12.320 --> 31:14.320
come on back. Okay bye. And that

31:14.320 --> 31:16.320
brings us. The little boy wanders

31:16.320 --> 31:18.320
through the party with his game boy.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.320
And he's

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
been told to meet people

31:22.320 --> 31:24.320
as much as he can but he's basically relying

31:24.320 --> 31:26.320
on them to shout out to him.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.320
Pretty game boy focused otherwise.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
And he runs straight into the legs

31:30.320 --> 31:32.320
of... Well he'd run into

31:32.320 --> 31:34.320
some bedazzled jeans that might do

31:34.320 --> 31:36.320
that boy some harm because they are

31:36.320 --> 31:38.320
shiny these jeans.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.320
And above them a big old

31:40.320 --> 31:42.320
belt buckle. White tank top

31:42.320 --> 31:44.320
tight and tucked in

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
under a pearl snapped unbuttoned

31:46.320 --> 31:48.320
cowboy shirt. Joni

31:48.320 --> 31:50.320
Pettymore the first is

31:50.320 --> 31:52.320
wearing some high top Nikes

31:52.320 --> 31:54.320
to bottom out that whole situation

31:54.320 --> 31:56.320
clothing wise.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.320
She's got a bleached

31:58.320 --> 32:00.320
blonde perm

32:00.320 --> 32:02.320
with super dark roots. And her

32:02.320 --> 32:04.320
eye shadow gives

32:04.320 --> 32:06.320
raccoon. Oh it's giving raccoon?

32:06.320 --> 32:08.320
Oh it's totally giving raccoon.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.320
And immediately

32:10.320 --> 32:12.320
upon this kid

32:12.320 --> 32:14.320
bumping into her she just pushes

32:14.320 --> 32:16.320
him away from her.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.320
He looks up from his game boy and he's like Mom

32:18.320 --> 32:20.320
I'm not your mother.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.320
Do you hear me? Oh I'm sorry

32:22.320 --> 32:24.320
Go on get running then.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.320
Okay okay bye.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.320
Joni Pettymore the first

32:28.320 --> 32:30.320
is a

32:30.320 --> 32:32.320
fucking wreck.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.320
Flash back to

32:36.320 --> 32:38.320
you see her

32:38.320 --> 32:40.320
in the exact same outfit

32:40.320 --> 32:42.320
climbing out of a second story

32:42.320 --> 32:44.320
window and like

32:44.320 --> 32:46.320
kind of reaching out for the drain

32:46.320 --> 32:48.320
pipe on the left side

32:48.320 --> 32:50.320
and she just kind of makes

32:50.320 --> 32:52.320
a jump for it and as she's shimmying

32:52.320 --> 32:54.320
down someone's hollering

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
from out the window. You

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
get back here Joni.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.320
Zips on down. She's like

33:00.320 --> 33:02.320
What do you fucking know? Come on down

33:02.320 --> 33:04.320
here. How about that? And she

33:04.320 --> 33:06.320
dips off running off into

33:06.320 --> 33:08.320
the distance. We flash back

33:08.320 --> 33:10.320
previous to that. You see

33:10.320 --> 33:12.320
her she's going through the

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
metal detector to get into

33:14.320 --> 33:16.320
high school and then immediately

33:16.320 --> 33:18.320
heads to the bathroom

33:18.320 --> 33:20.320
goes into one of the stalls. She's

33:20.320 --> 33:22.320
wearing the exact same outfit that I

33:22.320 --> 33:24.320
described before but she is

33:24.320 --> 33:26.320
six years younger ish

33:26.320 --> 33:28.320
and she opens up her

33:28.320 --> 33:30.320
backpack pulls out a

33:30.320 --> 33:32.320
ziplock bag that has

33:32.320 --> 33:34.320
like a is it dehydrated urine

33:34.320 --> 33:36.320
she shoves a straw into

33:36.320 --> 33:38.320
it and starts

33:38.320 --> 33:40.320
pulling on this straw like it's

33:40.320 --> 33:42.320
her job sucking down liquid

33:42.320 --> 33:44.320
in this bag and then

33:44.320 --> 33:46.320
giving it that kind of

33:46.320 --> 33:48.320
breath like she's just

33:48.320 --> 33:50.320
barrel proof whiskey through that

33:50.320 --> 33:52.320
ziplock bag.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.320
She puts it back in the backpack

33:54.320 --> 33:56.320
and heads back into

33:56.320 --> 33:58.320
the high school there

33:58.320 --> 34:00.320
and as she walks through the hallway

34:00.320 --> 34:02.320
she runs into her boyfriend

34:02.320 --> 34:04.320
Jared Krinklehoff

34:04.320 --> 34:06.320
wearing a

34:06.320 --> 34:08.320
letterman's jacket and

34:08.320 --> 34:10.320
Thomas just gave me

34:10.320 --> 34:12.320
big eyes. I was

34:12.320 --> 34:14.320
preparing. Okay.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.320
He's wearing a letterman's

34:16.320 --> 34:18.320
jacket and immediately he puts

34:18.320 --> 34:20.320
his arm around her and he's like

34:20.320 --> 34:22.320
Joni hey Joni how's it going?

34:22.320 --> 34:24.320
She's like don't do that

34:24.320 --> 34:26.320
voice don't do it.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.320
Immediately is like transformed

34:28.320 --> 34:30.320
by the presence of this young man

34:30.320 --> 34:32.320
and the little love that

34:32.320 --> 34:34.320
they have and it flash forwards to her

34:34.320 --> 34:36.320
slamming a screen door

34:36.320 --> 34:38.320
closed and is like I say

34:38.320 --> 34:40.320
that Joni is yours for

34:40.320 --> 34:42.320
the weekend I gotta go to

34:42.320 --> 34:44.320
a family function and based on

34:44.320 --> 34:46.320
the way you acted last time

34:46.320 --> 34:48.320
you're not allowed so you're gonna be

34:48.320 --> 34:50.320
here alright and she

34:50.320 --> 34:52.320
walks out the door and as she's walking out she's

34:52.320 --> 34:54.320
eyeing the muscle car that's

34:54.320 --> 34:56.320
half renovated that's what they

34:56.320 --> 34:58.320
call renovated for cars

34:58.320 --> 35:00.320
in the driveway and she pulls

35:00.320 --> 35:02.320
out a little butterfly knife

35:02.320 --> 35:04.320
and she just runs it

35:04.320 --> 35:06.320
down the whole side of the car

35:06.320 --> 35:08.320
as she heads out with

35:08.320 --> 35:10.320
a screech.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.320
She cracked your key into the

35:12.320 --> 35:14.320
side.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.320
And then yeah she's on

35:18.320 --> 35:20.320
the way out to the Pettymore Holler today

35:20.320 --> 35:22.320
by herself in a car

35:22.320 --> 35:24.320
that you are considerably

35:24.320 --> 35:26.320
worried about how it's running

35:26.320 --> 35:28.320
and whether it would pass an inspection

35:28.320 --> 35:30.320
and she goes into a

35:30.320 --> 35:32.320
gas station and

35:32.320 --> 35:34.320
she steals

35:34.320 --> 35:36.320
a water bottle and as

35:36.320 --> 35:38.320
she uh. Empty or full? A full

35:38.320 --> 35:40.320
water bottle that's

35:40.320 --> 35:42.320
theft. Oh right

35:42.320 --> 35:44.320
yes.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.320
Yes. She goes in to

35:46.320 --> 35:48.320
steal a water bottle but as

35:48.320 --> 35:50.320
she's heading out.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.320
Roll to steal the water bottle? Yeah okay.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.320
23

35:54.320 --> 35:56.320
on a criminology

35:56.320 --> 35:58.320
of 80.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.320
Oh yeah she's bad.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.320
She's bad. Oh look at

36:02.320 --> 36:04.320
Joanie she's bad. And as she's on her way

36:04.320 --> 36:06.320
out she actually catches a glimpse

36:06.320 --> 36:08.320
up at the front of

36:08.320 --> 36:10.320
the register.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.320
There are these prepackaged

36:12.320 --> 36:14.320
bags of whiskey

36:14.320 --> 36:16.320
being sold right there at the register.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.320
When did this start?

36:18.320 --> 36:20.320
We've had them in for

36:20.320 --> 36:22.320
six or so months now they seem pretty popular.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.320
Would you like a bag?

36:24.320 --> 36:26.320
No.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.320
I think I just

36:28.320 --> 36:30.320
want a pack of smokes.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.320
Yellows. Okay. And when he turns

36:32.320 --> 36:34.320
around she's gonna grab

36:34.320 --> 36:36.320
a bag of whiskey.

36:36.320 --> 36:38.320
Actually you know what

36:38.320 --> 36:40.320
I gotta quit. I gotta quit.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.320
I keep telling myself I gotta quit. Lord's gonna help me

36:42.320 --> 36:44.320
this time. I gotta go. Well bless

36:44.320 --> 36:46.320
you much ma'am and good luck in

36:46.320 --> 36:48.320
your journey. 36 that's it.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.320
Hey didn't I

36:50.320 --> 36:52.320
have five bags

36:52.320 --> 36:54.320
of whiskey? He says as the door closes

36:54.320 --> 36:56.320
on him.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.320
Go on then run.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.320
And then she goes to the party?

37:00.320 --> 37:02.320
Yeah that was me flashing back to the kid.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.320
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
Oh okay I thought maybe I was your

37:06.320 --> 37:08.320
kid but you established that you left

37:08.320 --> 37:10.320
your kid at home. You must just

37:10.320 --> 37:12.320
a lot of the women here look like you.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.320
I'll

37:14.320 --> 37:16.320
go find my mom.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.320
Thank you for talking with me.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.320
Goodbye. Oh I'm sorry I'm sorry

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
we got off to a wrong start. You gave me a scare there

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
cause I didn't know you were gonna be in front of me when

37:24.320 --> 37:26.320
you were walking backwards. You best expect

37:26.320 --> 37:28.320
me to be everywhere. Oh that's fun.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.320
Yeah I'm a pettymore same as you.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.320
Okay I like that spirit.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.320
I like that spirit. God damn right you do.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.320
And he kicks your shin really hard and he runs off.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.320
The

37:38.320 --> 37:40.320
pettymore way. That's how you say

37:40.320 --> 37:42.320
bye in pettymore.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.320
As you've all arrived

37:44.320 --> 37:46.320
you see Arlo around the drink

37:46.320 --> 37:48.320
table. Joni I assume you might be heading

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
in there too. A lot of pettymores are actually

37:50.320 --> 37:52.320
the first stop traditionally. You gotta get

37:52.320 --> 37:54.320
your lubrication, get your libations

37:54.320 --> 37:56.320
and then you can talk to your god damn family

37:56.320 --> 37:58.320
right?

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
Cause that's what family's for.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.320
You see Ma kind of deep in conversation

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
like on the other side of the party with some older

38:04.320 --> 38:06.320
older relatives you haven't seen in years

38:06.320 --> 38:08.320
and immediately around you

38:08.320 --> 38:10.320
you notice a few people. It's all

38:10.320 --> 38:12.320
kind of mysterious

38:12.320 --> 38:14.320
what exactly is going on

38:14.320 --> 38:16.320
here. Why did Ma call everybody?

38:16.320 --> 38:18.320
Kind of, you know, you've left the

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
hauler, you've gone on to different sort of lives

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
it kind of seems like maybe we're leaving this whole thing

38:22.320 --> 38:24.320
behind. Maybe we had finally stopped

38:24.320 --> 38:26.320
killing and dying for this way of life.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.320
Killing ourselves trying to

38:28.320 --> 38:30.320
wring a way of life out of this hauler.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.320
I've been prepared a way for you to meet each other.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.320
Is that Joni I see over there?

38:34.320 --> 38:36.320
Oh hey Arlo how's it going?

38:36.320 --> 38:38.320
It's been a minute. Joni's been here.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.320
You still up to all the mess?

38:40.320 --> 38:42.320
Just making a living. Doing what I can.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.320
Guys I'm here too. You got all ten fingers?

38:44.320 --> 38:46.320
The camera pans down to the five foot three

38:46.320 --> 38:48.320
uh

38:48.320 --> 38:50.320
PDP

38:50.320 --> 38:52.320
Hi. Hey

38:52.320 --> 38:54.320
Petey. Hey Petey. Petey this man

38:54.320 --> 38:56.320
I don't want to see you. I was just going to pick your brain about

38:56.320 --> 38:58.320
something. You reckon there's a way I could get a

38:58.320 --> 39:00.320
hold of some of that rocket fuel?

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
I mean, yeah.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.320
I'd be willing to, you know,

39:04.320 --> 39:06.320
cut you in mate, let's say five

39:06.320 --> 39:08.320
percent of the SMC.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.320
I mean how much you need cause uh, who's to say

39:10.320 --> 39:12.320
I didn't take any with me? Oh it just takes

39:12.320 --> 39:14.320
a drop per batch. We can

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
send this shit into orbit right

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
here. It's been so long since I've tried

39:18.320 --> 39:20.320
some of your, what are you calling it again?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.320
It's uh, it's Saturday morning

39:22.320 --> 39:24.320
cartoons. Saturday morning cartoons. There was a kid

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
earlier who told me that they don't do that anymore.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.320
So I'm maybe thinking about a new name for it.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.320
Well SMT, it's been a while since I had

39:30.320 --> 39:32.320
some of your SMT but if I can

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
I'll do any, I got some. I took

39:34.320 --> 39:36.320
a gallon with me. Hell yeah.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.320
We in business. Well I've just been sitting out

39:38.320 --> 39:40.320
there just waiting for some kind of

39:40.320 --> 39:42.320
use and here we found it I think.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.320
Arlo spits in his hand and holds it out to you.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.320
Petey does the same and

39:46.320 --> 39:48.320
sticks it there. Match made in heaven.

39:48.320 --> 39:50.320
Pleasure doing business with you. Well I

39:50.320 --> 39:52.320
cannot wait. Anyway

39:52.320 --> 39:54.320
Joni was up. Where them rugrats

39:54.320 --> 39:56.320
yours? Junior? I left

39:56.320 --> 39:58.320
her uh, back with um,

39:58.320 --> 40:00.320
you know, Jared. I was talking

40:00.320 --> 40:02.320
to some kid who I thought could be yours

40:02.320 --> 40:04.320
but I guess it's not. Oh yeah

40:04.320 --> 40:06.320
they thought they were mine.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.320
Who's kid is that? Well I don't know that

40:08.320 --> 40:10.320
kid's about as, he's about

40:10.320 --> 40:12.320
as old as long as I've seen you so I figured

40:12.320 --> 40:14.320
who knows, probably Joni popping one out.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
No.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.320
This old thing? That kid?

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
As she does

40:20.320 --> 40:22.320
the uh, like full blown

40:22.320 --> 40:24.320
throws both of her karate

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
chop hands down

40:26.320 --> 40:28.320
to the groin. You can't tell if it's the

40:28.320 --> 40:30.320
same kid or not but a

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
small slender toe headed child pops

40:32.320 --> 40:34.320
out from underneath the tablecloth on

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
like the keg table

40:36.320 --> 40:38.320
and just runs out holding

40:38.320 --> 40:40.320
a comical amount of

40:40.320 --> 40:42.320
solo cups full of beer

40:42.320 --> 40:44.320
and disappears

40:44.320 --> 40:46.320
off into a group of other kids

40:46.320 --> 40:48.320
who all just start cheering.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.320
You did it! You did it!

40:50.320 --> 40:52.320
Run Luke! Just run!

40:52.320 --> 40:54.320
Remember back when we were kids

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
and we used to play Tipsy?

41:00.320 --> 41:02.320
I recognize

41:02.320 --> 41:04.320
you sent me down a path.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.320
Well I'm a good one cause you're

41:06.320 --> 41:08.320
look, you're making deals for rocket fuel.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.320
Hell yes! Damn.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.320
What about you Joni? As far as what?

41:12.320 --> 41:14.320
Making deals, rocket fuel

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
going to outer space like me.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.320
I mean I'm curious about learning more

41:18.320 --> 41:20.320
from each and every one of you

41:20.320 --> 41:22.320
I guess but you know I think there's

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
a lot of skills that I'm bringing to the table

41:24.320 --> 41:26.320
these days that could be of use

41:26.320 --> 41:28.320
to you as well. You know you're talking about

41:28.320 --> 41:30.320
maybe losing some

41:30.320 --> 41:32.320
rocket fuel you know if you need to lose

41:32.320 --> 41:34.320
something from something where you don't have

41:34.320 --> 41:36.320
the sort of connection where you can get

41:36.320 --> 41:38.320
in there I might be the kind of gal who

41:38.320 --> 41:40.320
could acquire such situations.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.320
Heck I reckon if I didn't have to buy

41:42.320 --> 41:44.320
any of them frosted flakes anymore

41:44.320 --> 41:46.320
bring that cost of goods

41:46.320 --> 41:48.320
way to hell. You know why they call me jungle style?

41:48.320 --> 41:50.320
They call you jungle style?

41:50.320 --> 41:52.320
Yes I remember that.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.320
Cause I'm in and out.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.320
Is that that? Is that that?

41:56.320 --> 41:58.320
Did I do it? They called you

41:58.320 --> 42:00.320
the flying detriment as far as I remember.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
So at that moment this woman with

42:04.320 --> 42:06.320
the crazy like bleached blonde

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
perm and electric

42:08.320 --> 42:10.320
like acid wash denim vest

42:10.320 --> 42:12.320
full like tiger leggings

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
she runs

42:14.320 --> 42:16.320
up and she says oh my goodness

42:16.320 --> 42:18.320
hello y'all it's so good to see

42:18.320 --> 42:20.320
all of you. It's been years since we've

42:20.320 --> 42:22.320
been together. Isn't it kind of strange though?

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
John not being here we're on his land.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.320
We're as hell. I mean what's

42:26.320 --> 42:28.320
the deal with that? You know he'd shoot us all.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.320
He'd shoot us all in a heartbeat. He'd shoot every last

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
one of us. He was a shooting

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
son of a bitch. He sure

42:34.320 --> 42:36.320
was. He sure was. Catch a stray

42:36.320 --> 42:38.320
an hour later falling from the sky.

42:38.320 --> 42:40.320
You can still see his shooting tree right

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
back there.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.320
That's an actual season

42:44.320 --> 42:46.320
one callback. That is

42:46.320 --> 42:48.320
a bonafide season one callback right there.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.320
Bonafide callback. I'm

42:50.320 --> 42:52.320
sorry sometimes I don't make any sense when I'm

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
grieving. Somebody told me that he

42:54.320 --> 42:56.320
shot just would go out in public and

42:56.320 --> 42:58.320
shoot his gun in the air when he was a police

42:58.320 --> 43:00.320
officer. Grieving? But now hey I

43:00.320 --> 43:02.320
I mean he's gone. So many

43:02.320 --> 43:04.320
of our boys are gone.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.320
I ain't wearing black you ain't wrapped up.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.320
Oh Johnny we've talked

43:08.320 --> 43:10.320
about this before. Six months.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.320
I mean how many times has a petty moor

43:12.320 --> 43:14.320
boy ran off though? I think it's been closer to a year.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.320
No it's weird to

43:16.320 --> 43:18.320
be weird about it after six months.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.320
I don't remember how much time exactly though.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.320
More than six months and that's strange

43:22.320 --> 43:24.320
to me. It just feels like no one's

43:24.320 --> 43:26.320
heard a word and. Well

43:26.320 --> 43:28.320
what about the other petty moors I heard gone

43:28.320 --> 43:30.320
missing? Sounds like they got out.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.320
I mean I guess they still

43:32.320 --> 43:34.320
their Facebooks haven't been posted on.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.320
Nobody's heard from them in the family

43:36.320 --> 43:38.320
group texts or via mail.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.320
But we hold I guess we got to hold out hope that's right

43:40.320 --> 43:42.320
that's right. I don't know if I want to hold

43:42.320 --> 43:44.320
out hope for John though because have you

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
heard about well have you heard about his

43:46.320 --> 43:48.320
good fortune? I mean if you believe

43:48.320 --> 43:50.320
them tales I guess I don't know if I do. You really

43:50.320 --> 43:52.320
think it's out there somewhere? The tales

43:52.320 --> 43:54.320
are he was a very rich man.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.320
I think that it's talking out of school. I will

43:56.320 --> 43:58.320
say that uh. I haven't

43:58.320 --> 44:00.320
been to school in a very long time Joni.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
That's why you're few years older than you.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
It's more like school's your butt talking

44:04.320 --> 44:06.320
out of it. I will say that Gregy's boy

44:06.320 --> 44:08.320
said he knew that

44:08.320 --> 44:10.320
his cousin Freddie was

44:10.320 --> 44:12.320
at the thing. At what thing?

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
When things went down.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.320
I heard they loaded it all into

44:16.320 --> 44:18.320
a trash truck and they drove

44:18.320 --> 44:20.320
that trash truck all the way across

44:20.320 --> 44:22.320
the country but it got blown up.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
I heard that petty moors for as long as

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
they've been around have been telling

44:26.320 --> 44:28.320
stories about lost treasures to keep

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
themselves busy and not minding

44:30.320 --> 44:32.320
their actual capitalistic ventures.

44:32.320 --> 44:34.320
Huh. Hmm. Well

44:34.320 --> 44:36.320
I mean but it is a good story Joni.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.320
Why are you such a downer? This is

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
a cookout. Why are you being so so

44:40.320 --> 44:42.320
odd about all this?

44:42.320 --> 44:44.320
No reason mom.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.320
I don't know.

44:46.320 --> 44:48.320
I just you know

44:48.320 --> 44:50.320
you could call me more

44:50.320 --> 44:52.320
baby. Yeah I could. Oh hell do you

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
need a drink? Yes I will have what I'm

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
having. Which is?

44:56.320 --> 44:58.320
And she points to the table

44:58.320 --> 45:00.320
which has a water bottle filled

45:00.320 --> 45:02.320
with whiskey.

45:04.320 --> 45:06.320
Joni just like

45:06.320 --> 45:08.320
your grandmother.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.320
She gives you a huge hug.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.320
And she goes

45:12.320 --> 45:14.320
just like grandma and she stabs

45:14.320 --> 45:16.320
just like a tiny pencil sized hole

45:16.320 --> 45:18.320
on the top of it and then squeeze bottles

45:18.320 --> 45:20.320
into her mouth.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.320
Wait did you bring more of those girls?

45:22.320 --> 45:24.320
Do you have

45:24.320 --> 45:26.320
one for your mother? I probably got a spare in the

45:26.320 --> 45:28.320
car I guess. I could go get it.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.320
Yeah. Alright. Cause you know there are

45:30.320 --> 45:32.320
some missing boys which means there's some

45:32.320 --> 45:34.320
wait. Never mind. That joke

45:34.320 --> 45:36.320
doesn't work.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.320
There's a couple missing

45:38.320 --> 45:40.320
girls too of my generation

45:40.320 --> 45:42.320
which means there's some

45:42.320 --> 45:44.320
you know eligible bachelors here. Oh.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.320
This again. Great. Well

45:46.320 --> 45:48.320
honey it's been five years since

45:48.320 --> 45:50.320
Steven died and I

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
just think you know it's time for your mom to

45:52.320 --> 45:54.320
get out there. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.320
Well Arlo, Peter

45:56.320 --> 45:58.320
it was wonderful to see you all. Honey do please

45:58.320 --> 46:00.320
call me more. I'm sure I'll see you around the party.

46:00.320 --> 46:02.320
Well what about the treasure

46:02.320 --> 46:04.320
though? You know she's probably right.

46:04.320 --> 46:06.320
There's no treasure. Where are people saying it is?

46:06.320 --> 46:08.320
You know. Like if there was

46:08.320 --> 46:10.320
one like. Oh honey

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
some people say it's in the barn.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.320
Some people say it's buried under the floorboard.

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
Some people say it's at the bottom of the ocean.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
Others say it's deep deep deep

46:18.320 --> 46:20.320
in the woods. I heard it got blown up in a

46:20.320 --> 46:22.320
trash truck is what I heard. A number of people

46:22.320 --> 46:24.320
are pressing the trash truck

46:24.320 --> 46:26.320
theory yes. Which I do

46:26.320 --> 46:28.320
admit has a ring of truth to it.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.320
It's so oddly specific. More

46:30.320 --> 46:32.320
thing about it more trash truck makes sense.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.320
Blown up a trash truck. I lean over

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
to Arlo and hey I heard

46:36.320 --> 46:38.320
Trey might know something about this or

46:38.320 --> 46:40.320
he's got a secret. A secret? Have you

46:40.320 --> 46:42.320
seen Trey? I ain't seen him. Johnny.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.320
You seen Trey?

46:44.320 --> 46:46.320
What are you two whispering about?

46:46.320 --> 46:48.320
Oh we were wondering where cousin Trey was

46:48.320 --> 46:50.320
I just hadn't seen him since I went to space.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.320
She steps on your foot.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.320
Nobody's seen Trey. I mean you know

46:54.320 --> 46:56.320
he's always late to these things. Oh yeah

46:56.320 --> 46:58.320
okay. I'm sure he'll be here if he wants

46:58.320 --> 47:00.320
to. And um she excuses herself

47:00.320 --> 47:02.320
she sees um what was the name of your

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
husband? Jared. She sees like his

47:04.320 --> 47:06.320
uncle. Whoa whoa why the fuck is he

47:06.320 --> 47:08.320
there? Because his uh. He's married in?

47:08.320 --> 47:10.320
Yeah he married in but

47:10.320 --> 47:12.320
he's ex married in. He's here for the kids.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.320
Nice. She runs up and goes uh

47:14.320 --> 47:16.320
did I say what his name was? No.

47:16.320 --> 47:18.320
Hi Sylvester.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.320
Hey how's it going?

47:20.320 --> 47:22.320
What a god.

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
Hey how you look? You look lovely

47:24.320 --> 47:26.320
today. Hey. It's been so

47:26.320 --> 47:28.320
long since I've seen you Dawn. Thank you for noticing

47:28.320 --> 47:30.320
I do look lovely. She's gone.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.320
You can't hear this. Not a day

47:32.320 --> 47:34.320
over 40.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
Ha! You!

47:36.320 --> 47:38.320
Yeah so

47:38.320 --> 47:40.320
you know that it's gonna be maybe

47:40.320 --> 47:42.320
30 minutes before y'all sit down to eat so you

47:42.320 --> 47:44.320
can continue to mingle. As soon as she walks

47:44.320 --> 47:46.320
away Joni looks at the two of them and she's

47:46.320 --> 47:48.320
like you two are the kind of people that I was hoping

47:48.320 --> 47:50.320
to talk to about all this maybe without

47:50.320 --> 47:52.320
the addition of more people who make

47:52.320 --> 47:54.320
the cut smaller. Oh I like

47:54.320 --> 47:56.320
where this is going. Ron. Uncle

47:56.320 --> 47:58.320
Ron you remember him? Yeah.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.320
He told me that Trey was looking

48:00.320 --> 48:02.320
for me. He might be planning something.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
If you guys are thinking about

48:04.320 --> 48:06.320
getting in on something with Trey I'd like to

48:06.320 --> 48:08.320
get along. Oh yeah.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.320
The more the merrier and only this

48:10.320 --> 48:12.320
case and no more.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
That's right we're keeping it to

48:14.320 --> 48:16.320
four. We'll keep it well Trey's

48:16.320 --> 48:18.320
gotta tell us and then we'll try to kick out

48:18.320 --> 48:20.320
whoever he's already talked to. That's smart. At that

48:20.320 --> 48:22.320
moment Uncle Ron hobbles up.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.320
Hey! Oh wait no I sounded like this

48:24.320 --> 48:26.320
didn't I? Hey

48:26.320 --> 48:28.320
it's good to see that you ran into these two

48:28.320 --> 48:30.320
cause they're exactly the folks that Trey's looking

48:30.320 --> 48:32.320
to help you up with. Where's Trey at?

48:32.320 --> 48:34.320
Don't know he's learning late he should be here

48:34.320 --> 48:36.320
soon. Gotta go bye. Bye.

48:36.320 --> 48:38.320
Aliens

48:38.320 --> 48:40.320
are real.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.320
What? What?

48:42.320 --> 48:44.320
That's all you get for now I'll tell you after.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.320
Come flab it.

48:46.320 --> 48:48.320
So yeah

48:48.320 --> 48:50.320
you've got an opportunity now to

48:50.320 --> 48:52.320
look around the property maybe poke around

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
if you want to get a little frisky but

48:54.320 --> 48:56.320
you could also talk to some more people here.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.320
There's a few interesting

48:58.320 --> 49:00.320
characters that you might see around

49:00.320 --> 49:02.320
you. Maybe they're highlighted if this was a video

49:02.320 --> 49:04.320
game. Maybe it seems like there's some more

49:04.320 --> 49:06.320
conversation options with them.

49:06.320 --> 49:08.320
Peter remembers the last time that he was

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
at John's house. John

49:10.320 --> 49:12.320
was like starting his DVD

49:12.320 --> 49:14.320
collection and so he wants

49:14.320 --> 49:16.320
to go snoop around and see how

49:16.320 --> 49:18.320
big John got that collection.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.320
Yeah well did he have all of prison

49:20.320 --> 49:22.320
break break break that we

49:22.320 --> 49:24.320
need to take right now. Everyone we're gonna

49:24.320 --> 49:26.320
take a break real quick.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.320
Stand up

49:28.320 --> 49:30.320
stretch your legs go to the bathroom

49:30.320 --> 49:32.320
grab another seltzer water

49:32.320 --> 49:34.320
do whatever you need to do for

49:34.320 --> 49:36.320
life and stuff.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.320
And we're back

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320

49:40.320 --> 49:42.320

my parents Don and Han

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
Don and Han

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
a woman who may or may not have been your mother

50:52.320 --> 50:54.320
I named Maxine

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
moments before I invented her

50:56.320 --> 50:58.320
but then we ran with the fact that she was your mom

50:58.320 --> 51:00.320
I like

51:00.320 --> 51:02.320
yeah Don Maxine

51:02.320 --> 51:04.320
Don Maxine Pettymore

51:04.320 --> 51:06.320
she's run off to go

51:06.320 --> 51:08.320
to go to court

51:08.320 --> 51:10.320
and

51:10.320 --> 51:12.320
Uncle Ron just confirmed

51:12.320 --> 51:14.320
you were the three that Trey wanted to see

51:14.320 --> 51:16.320
Trey you would all know

51:16.320 --> 51:18.320
he's the cool

51:18.320 --> 51:20.320
pettymore

51:20.320 --> 51:22.320
Joe and Luke

51:22.320 --> 51:24.320
Trey is a little bit younger

51:24.320 --> 51:26.320
than you guys he's right in between

51:26.320 --> 51:28.320
John who was

51:28.320 --> 51:30.320
26 at the time of his disappearance

51:30.320 --> 51:32.320
and your generation so he's in like

51:32.320 --> 51:34.320
his late 30s he was a

51:34.320 --> 51:36.320
he was maybe a rough kid to love

51:36.320 --> 51:38.320
depending on who you were if

51:38.320 --> 51:40.320
you were the object of like

51:40.320 --> 51:42.320
his charm and his magnetism

51:42.320 --> 51:44.320
he lit up the whole world

51:44.320 --> 51:46.320
it sounds like Jesus everybody loves this kid

51:46.320 --> 51:48.320
it does sound like Jesus

51:48.320 --> 51:50.320
so far it's Jesus

51:50.320 --> 51:52.320
don't spoil my Christ narrative

51:54.320 --> 51:56.320
everything's a Christ

51:56.320 --> 51:58.320
narrative some of you

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
if maybe you got in the way of something

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
that Trey wanted you might have seen a different

52:02.320 --> 52:04.320
side of him and he left

52:04.320 --> 52:06.320
the family pretty early he was not around

52:06.320 --> 52:08.320
for the long slow

52:08.320 --> 52:10.320
decline of Pettymore Holler

52:10.320 --> 52:12.320
he in fact is one of the original

52:12.320 --> 52:14.320
exedees he left

52:14.320 --> 52:16.320
out on his own into the world

52:16.320 --> 52:18.320
short of it is Trey does his own thing

52:18.320 --> 52:20.320
you don't know when he's going to show up

52:20.320 --> 52:22.320
you know when he does it'll probably be pretty loud

52:22.320 --> 52:24.320
you know when he do it's going to be loud

52:24.320 --> 52:26.320
you know when he do it's going to be loud and that's Trey

52:26.320 --> 52:28.320
but Luke what's your character's name?

52:28.320 --> 52:30.320
Petey Petey had just asked to go see

52:30.320 --> 52:32.320
inside the house to check on

52:32.320 --> 52:34.320
John's DVD collection

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
so you walk in through the front door

52:36.320 --> 52:38.320
and there's a lot of Pettymores

52:38.320 --> 52:40.320
in the kitchen cooking food and

52:40.320 --> 52:42.320
getting things ready there's a lot of hustle and bustle

52:42.320 --> 52:44.320
and you get caught up for a minute as people are saying

52:44.320 --> 52:46.320
oh hi Lexel hello

52:46.320 --> 52:48.320
I haven't seen you in years what are you doing?

52:48.320 --> 52:50.320
how you been? oh my god

52:50.320 --> 52:52.320
what's your spice?

52:52.320 --> 52:54.320
I'm crying I'm crying I'm actually

52:54.320 --> 52:56.320
crying it's the three of you

52:56.320 --> 52:58.320
you brush past all that

52:58.320 --> 53:00.320
you get into the living room

53:00.320 --> 53:02.320
which is eerily quiet considering

53:02.320 --> 53:04.320
the size of this party nobody really

53:04.320 --> 53:06.320
wants to hang out in the

53:06.320 --> 53:08.320
house besides the kitchen because

53:08.320 --> 53:10.320
it's exactly as John left it

53:10.320 --> 53:12.320
in the living room you see the DVD collection

53:12.320 --> 53:14.320
the shelf that they're on

53:14.320 --> 53:16.320
looks like it was broken and half repaired

53:16.320 --> 53:18.320
at one point all of them are there but

53:18.320 --> 53:20.320
Petey the first time you saw it

53:20.320 --> 53:22.320
you were amazed it was the most organized

53:22.320 --> 53:24.320
thing in John's house and now you see

53:24.320 --> 53:26.320
it's kind of been hastily shoved back on

53:26.320 --> 53:28.320
you know Smokey 3 before Smokey 2

53:28.320 --> 53:30.320
it wasn't

53:30.320 --> 53:32.320
what? that's embarrassing

53:32.320 --> 53:34.320
sacrilege

53:34.320 --> 53:36.320
one of the reasons nobody's really sitting anywhere

53:36.320 --> 53:38.320
is that you can see

53:38.320 --> 53:40.320
a lot of bullet holes in the ceiling

53:40.320 --> 53:42.320
and the couch

53:42.320 --> 53:44.320
is covered in drywall debris

53:46.320 --> 53:48.320
and some foam insulation

53:48.320 --> 53:50.320
from the attic that's wafted down through the bullet holes

53:50.320 --> 53:52.320
while he's looking at the DVD collection

53:52.320 --> 53:54.320
Petey sorry sorry real

53:54.320 --> 53:56.320
quick sorry not insulation

53:56.320 --> 53:58.320
popcorn actual popcorn

53:58.320 --> 54:00.320
you can see some

54:00.320 --> 54:02.320
leaking out of a little plastic

54:02.320 --> 54:04.320
bag and you remember that

54:04.320 --> 54:06.320
John used to take home

54:06.320 --> 54:08.320
the huge plastic bags of

54:08.320 --> 54:10.320
popcorn that they stocked concession stands

54:10.320 --> 54:12.320
with at the Raceway and he

54:12.320 --> 54:14.320
he filled his attic with that

54:14.320 --> 54:16.320
to use as insulation

54:16.320 --> 54:18.320
and it's cold in here because the squirrels

54:18.320 --> 54:20.320
have eaten most of his popcorn

54:20.320 --> 54:22.320
Petey

54:22.320 --> 54:24.320
is looking at the

54:24.320 --> 54:26.320
DVD collection and is

54:26.320 --> 54:28.320
just a little sad looking at it

54:28.320 --> 54:30.320
thinking about John but also just sad

54:30.320 --> 54:32.320
that it's not as perfect as he remembered

54:32.320 --> 54:34.320
but he kind of

54:34.320 --> 54:36.320
fixes it up a little bit and then from

54:36.320 --> 54:38.320
the inside of his jumper pulls out a signed

54:38.320 --> 54:40.320
he has signed a copy of

54:40.320 --> 54:42.320
Space Cowboys

54:42.320 --> 54:44.320
and then

54:44.320 --> 54:46.320
slips it in alphabetically

54:46.320 --> 54:48.320
where it should go

54:48.320 --> 54:50.320
so in between Space Cowboys and

54:50.320 --> 54:52.320
Space Cowboys director cut

54:52.320 --> 54:54.320
so now he's got one

54:54.320 --> 54:56.320
one regular Space Cowboys

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
one Space Cowboys signed by an

54:58.320 --> 55:00.320
astronaut right very cool

55:00.320 --> 55:02.320
Peter you probably would have been

55:02.320 --> 55:04.320
someone you wish John had looked up to

55:04.320 --> 55:06.320
I think you probably tried to put him on the straight and narrow

55:06.320 --> 55:08.320
a little bit or at least you know show him that

55:08.320 --> 55:10.320
with hard work and dedication you can

55:10.320 --> 55:12.320
join the Air Force get through Air Force Academy

55:12.320 --> 55:14.320
go to the become an astronaut

55:14.320 --> 55:16.320
and John thought it was cool that

55:16.320 --> 55:18.320
you were an astronaut but he thought it was

55:18.320 --> 55:20.320
a lot cooler that Trey had a dope car

55:20.320 --> 55:22.320
yeah Petey is content

55:22.320 --> 55:24.320
in the fact knowing that John

55:24.320 --> 55:26.320
also wore blue though

55:26.320 --> 55:28.320
just like Pete

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
I always picture them wearing kind of a tan

55:30.320 --> 55:32.320
it's funny I did too

55:32.320 --> 55:34.320
well the cop in the

55:34.320 --> 55:36.320
season one thing is wearing blue but

55:36.320 --> 55:38.320
even if they didn't wear blue you know

55:38.320 --> 55:40.320
they're wearing blue

55:40.320 --> 55:42.320
I actually pictured you wearing blue

55:42.320 --> 55:44.320
because then when Clark changed into

55:44.320 --> 55:46.320
the 70's CPD uniform

55:46.320 --> 55:48.320
and it was tan

55:48.320 --> 55:50.320
so yeah they both wore blue

55:50.320 --> 55:52.320
also I pictured Keith wearing that light

55:52.320 --> 55:54.320
blue shirt so you know he's like

55:54.320 --> 55:56.320
not his cop

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320
even though he was probably the most cop of all

56:00.320 --> 56:02.320
them

56:04.320 --> 56:06.320
but yeah he's

56:06.320 --> 56:08.320
sticks it in there looks back and is thinking

56:08.320 --> 56:10.320
like you know

56:10.320 --> 56:12.320
maybe if we find him we can

56:12.320 --> 56:14.320
set him set him straight

56:14.320 --> 56:16.320
somewhere perhaps through like the rustling

56:16.320 --> 56:18.320
wind through the bullet holes in the attic

56:18.320 --> 56:20.320
you just hear a it sounds like a comforting

56:20.320 --> 56:22.320
sigh and you think

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
maybe somewhere John would like

56:24.320 --> 56:26.320
what I just did with his DVDs

56:26.320 --> 56:28.320
Pete feels good are you fucking with John's DVDs

56:28.320 --> 56:30.320
over there Petey I was just fixing them they're

56:30.320 --> 56:32.320
all messed up which is unlike

56:32.320 --> 56:34.320
John we'll write that one down as

56:34.320 --> 56:36.320
maybe he did go missing and

56:36.320 --> 56:38.320
didn't run away

56:40.320 --> 56:42.320
you guys look back and Joni's

56:42.320 --> 56:44.320
not there because while Jon

56:44.320 --> 56:46.320
is family Joni's a thief

56:46.320 --> 56:48.320
and right now she's

56:48.320 --> 56:50.320
very much interested in one

56:50.320 --> 56:52.320
thing and that is getting

56:52.320 --> 56:54.320
an undershirt of John's

56:54.320 --> 56:56.320
that has that manly manly

56:56.320 --> 56:58.320
smell on it that she can

56:58.320 --> 57:00.320
put in her car to piss

57:00.320 --> 57:02.320
off Jared later

57:04.320 --> 57:06.320
Joni as

57:06.320 --> 57:08.320
you head back to the bedroom

57:08.320 --> 57:10.320
to the bad room

57:12.320 --> 57:14.320
that's what

57:14.320 --> 57:16.320
John always called it

57:16.320 --> 57:18.320
depends

57:18.320 --> 57:20.320
on what time of day it is sometimes

57:20.320 --> 57:22.320
after a night

57:22.320 --> 57:24.320
a night of Miller lights and beer

57:24.320 --> 57:26.320
pretzels the bathroom's the bad room

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
you know what I'm saying

57:28.320 --> 57:30.320
got to do some bad things

57:30.320 --> 57:32.320
like a good thick one

57:32.320 --> 57:34.320
Joni you would see in the hallway on the way to the

57:34.320 --> 57:36.320
bedroom a number of

57:36.320 --> 57:38.320
framed pictures of John and

57:38.320 --> 57:40.320
lots of your family but you see

57:40.320 --> 57:42.320
a few of you and John

57:42.320 --> 57:44.320
he was about three years older

57:44.320 --> 57:46.320
than you so like just

57:46.320 --> 57:48.320
in that sweet spot

57:48.320 --> 57:50.320
for cousin friends

57:50.320 --> 57:52.320
but older enough to be cool

57:52.320 --> 57:54.320
and influential you guys were pretty close

57:54.320 --> 57:56.320
I tried to drive a cool car cause he did but I

57:56.320 --> 57:58.320
can't afford a cool car

57:58.320 --> 58:00.320
dated a guy with a cool car cause he had a cool car

58:00.320 --> 58:02.320
when you say you want a cool car

58:02.320 --> 58:04.320
the picture falls off the wall

58:04.320 --> 58:06.320
she catches it

58:06.320 --> 58:08.320
ooh can I catch it

58:08.320 --> 58:10.320
you can roll to catch it

58:10.320 --> 58:12.320
what should I roll

58:12.320 --> 58:14.320
dexterity or athletics

58:14.320 --> 58:16.320
that's a 40 on an 85

58:16.320 --> 58:18.320
dexterity you catch it

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
it says my distinguishing feature is wiry

58:20.320 --> 58:22.320
like a live wire

58:22.320 --> 58:24.320
like a live wire

58:24.320 --> 58:26.320
wire like a live wire

58:26.320 --> 58:28.320
you can feel the back of the frame feels a little weird

58:28.320 --> 58:30.320
it's kind of bulging out like

58:30.320 --> 58:32.320
there's something stuck back there

58:32.320 --> 58:34.320
she immediately is going to go for the bulge

58:34.320 --> 58:36.320
looking back in the picture

58:36.320 --> 58:38.320
there's something stuck between the picture itself

58:38.320 --> 58:40.320
and the backing

58:40.320 --> 58:42.320
she does all the little clips

58:42.320 --> 58:44.320
around the back edge of it

58:44.320 --> 58:46.320
which is easy cause only two of them are holding

58:46.320 --> 58:48.320
the whole thing on and she kind of slides it out

58:48.320 --> 58:50.320
what's back there

58:50.320 --> 58:52.320
there's a little note and it says

58:52.320 --> 58:54.320
hey Joni

58:54.320 --> 58:56.320
she smiles

58:56.320 --> 58:58.320
big

58:58.320 --> 59:00.320
it's your old cousin Jon Jon

59:00.320 --> 59:02.320
I thought you might be one of the ones who could

59:02.320 --> 59:04.320
seek out some of these clues that I've left behind

59:04.320 --> 59:06.320
here's the deal Joni

59:06.320 --> 59:08.320
I came into a treasure

59:08.320 --> 59:10.320
and I don't know if I'm going to be able to enjoy it

59:10.320 --> 59:12.320
in this life

59:12.320 --> 59:14.320
so I want my family

59:14.320 --> 59:16.320
at least whoever in my family deserves it

59:16.320 --> 59:18.320
and aside from my clues

59:18.320 --> 59:20.320
it might be you

59:20.320 --> 59:22.320
and you know any team you might assemble ocean style

59:22.320 --> 59:24.320
to aid you in this process

59:24.320 --> 59:26.320
oceans 12

59:28.320 --> 59:30.320
oh yeah she's folding up this note

59:30.320 --> 59:32.320
is there a clue at the bottom?

59:32.320 --> 59:34.320
there's more

59:34.320 --> 59:36.320
I was like that is a shit first clue unless there's

59:36.320 --> 59:38.320
like some coded message in here

59:38.320 --> 59:40.320
yeah or it's the world's greatest clue

59:40.320 --> 59:42.320
I buried the treasure

59:42.320 --> 59:44.320
at these coordinates

59:44.320 --> 59:46.320
man

59:46.320 --> 59:48.320
alright I just got to figure out

59:48.320 --> 59:50.320
what coordinates are

59:50.320 --> 59:52.320
I always did like

59:52.320 --> 59:54.320
you Joni you reminded me of myself

59:54.320 --> 59:56.320
she's in the bathroom at the door shut

59:56.320 --> 59:58.320
there were certain things

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.320
she sits on the toilet that's not actually

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.320
one of the sentences I'm riffing this all

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.320
uh

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.320
there was one thing

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.320
in particular we loved

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.320
about Smokey and the bandit

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.320
one thing find that thing

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.320
and you'll find your next clue

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.320
and you remember you guys always just talked about how

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.320
fucking sweet it would be to have the uh

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.320
77 black Trans Am

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.320
his dad's car

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.320
Jon's dad's car? yeah

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.320
is that a thing? yeah

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.320
of course it is I'm Jon talking to you in this letter

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320
I know what car my dad drives stupid

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.320
it was in the flashback to

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.320
when they went and stole

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.320
the baby uh fuck yeah

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.320
in the back of that 77

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.320
anyway Joni

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320
I really hope it's you

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.320
or your team again if you have assembled one

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.320
who finds my treasure

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:48.320
absolutely not just me

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.320
me and me alone can do this

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320
the next clue is somewhere

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320
on this property the clue after that

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.320
is gonna be harder good luck

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.320
and there's a little winky smiley face

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.320
and if you look down the line of pictures on the wall

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.320
you see actually a lot of them are bulging

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.320
oh I grab those

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.320
I grab all of those

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.320
they're not coming off

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.320
uh fuck

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.320
unnatural yeah that's a fail 92

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.320
your cousin Jon was apparently

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.320
Peter naturally good

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.320
at attaching pictures to walls

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.320
it looks like it's just

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.320
should be just a simple wire

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.320
but try as you might you can't get

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.320
any of the other pictures to come off

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.320
the wall and you see one um

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320
Peter these are Peter naturally

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.320
put on the wall do you think you can

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.320
handle it? what the fuck are you talking

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.320
about? and you

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.320
see Petey's fumbling

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.320
around with a DVD he's

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.320
decided that it would be a good ambiance to have

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320
smoking the bandit on in the background

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320
what? if you come into the

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.320
hallway and if Arlo follows

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.320
Arlo let's go see what she's screaming about

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.320
back there Jon are you down there taking

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.320
she shoved the note in her pocket

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.320
Jon are you down there taking a

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.320
trip down memory lane?

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.320
let me see some of them photos

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.320
what you got over there? while they're on their way real quick

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.320
take a

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320
sanity roll for me

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.320
I rolled a 76 on a

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.320
45 it's not right

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.320
it ain't right it's not right

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.320
it ain't right it ain't right Jon was good

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.320
but nobody's better than Joni

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.320
no fucking wall is gonna keep

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.320
these pictures on here if you want them

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.320
so why can this wall not

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.320
give you it's picture? Arlo try to take that

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.320
try to take that picture off this wall look at this

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.320
look at this and she's like grabbing onto

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.320
it and she's gonna try to like put her feet

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.320
up on the wall

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.320
to show that it's really

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.320
stuck on there

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.320
as Arlo and Peter walk in

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.320
and look at this

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.320
a picture actually of all three of you and Jon

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.320
like on a float trip

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.320
plops off the wall

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320
and it's also bulging

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.320
can I try to catch it?

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.320
yeah

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.320
what am I rolling?

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.320
athletics or dexterity

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.320
it's what I was hanging onto right?

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.320
I got an 88 on a 70

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.320
the picture shatters

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.320
it bounces down the hallway into the

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.320
fireplace

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.320
the picture shatters?

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.320
you know the glass shatters

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.320
fuck it was a really nice frame it's broken

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.320
fuck and Peter

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320
the glass is poked right through your face

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320
my face?

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320
ruining forever as far as you

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.320
know the only copy of a

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.320
pretty nice picture of the four of you

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.320
oh through my face of the picture

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.320
yeah and you cut

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.320
I thought you made my real face

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.320
and you slice your finger take a D4 of damage

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.320
god dammit look at what you've done

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.320
Petey

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320
you took a

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.320
I slice from like

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.320
pointer finger down to below my

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.320
wrist

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.320
oh fuck

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.320
blood splatters the ceiling

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.320
can I try to first aid myself?

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.320
well cook has canceled

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.320
I'll get you to the hospital

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.320
more like cook I just started

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.320
fuck does anyone know first aid?

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320
nope I got you I got you

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.320
I got you Petey you know that's the thing

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.320
ew ew ew

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.320
37 on a 50 for first aid

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.320
I cannot do blood

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.320
oh fuck dude hang on a second here

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.320
give me a second he pulls out a bandana

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320
out of his back pocket and just wraps it around there real tight

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.320
he knows where to stomps the bleeding

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.320
just right that's not gonna feel good

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.320
for a while but you'll be alright

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.320
man what the

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.320
what's that? is there anything

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.320
amongst the shattered glass?

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.320
there's blood everywhere but um

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.320
but Arlo is able before

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.320
it just gets like

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.320
fire hosed with your blood spray

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.320
to nimbly grab a note that's in there

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.320
and it's essentially the exact same

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.320
note as before it says hey

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.320
Arlo, Peter, and Joni

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.320
I feel so much

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.320
less special now

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.320
do I lose any

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320
grip or? yeah you're gonna have to take a

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320
you're gonna have to take a little grip roll for

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320
what do I lose? uh just one

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.320
just one I only lose one

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320
you lose one nice

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.320
welcome to the hunt for my

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320
lost treasure

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.320
fuck dude

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.320
it comes out at the bottom like

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.320
Joni is this what you're talking about?

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.320
yeah I guess so

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.320
right about now Joni you're probably feeling

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.320
pretty unspecial

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.320
but if this picture came off the wall

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320
it means all of you are here god dammit

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.320
I couldn't happen to know who might

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.320
stumble into my house or why

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.320
I figured you might try to rob me

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.320
hell I figured all three of you might try to rob me

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320
yup but the fact of the matter

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.320
is you're some of the only petty mores who have

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.320
the smarts, know how, gumption

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320
and the character

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320
to deserve my treasure

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.320
hell yeah hell yeah

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.320
remember when we all used to watch Smokey and the Bandit

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.320
together? oh I love that car

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.320
remember how cool that car was

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320
didn't his daddy have one of those?

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.320
yeah daddy drove one right up until the day he

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.320
disappeared and then that car went missing

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.320
shortly thereafter

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320
he rebuilt the son of bitch from the ground up too

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.320
well what's the rest of this note here say?

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320
yada yada yada

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.320
treasure treasure treasure treasure

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320
series of clues

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320
oh hey we gotta find that

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320
car I think

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.320
good luck to y'all I love you lots

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.320
Arlo looks up into the sky

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320
but it's a couple bullet holes

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.320
looking at popcorn

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.320
love you too John

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.320
there's a breeze of warm loving air

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320
through those holes

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320
that's what she said

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320
hey Arlo you know there's nothing up there but stars right?

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320
I just farted

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320
was that Johnny saying that? yup

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320
uh

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.320
I've been up there

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.320
Arlo there's nothing

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.320
so you know you know you pass right through heaven

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320
and Peter thinks about the time

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.320
spent piloting jets and stuff

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.320
and that was heaven

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.320
you can probably smell it now

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320
punched a hole right through that thing

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.320
well shit boys and Joni

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.320
we gotta do something let's go

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.320
yeah we gotta find the car 77

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320
you know where you said it got lost

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320
stolen something? what do I remember

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.320
about the car? I bet Ma knows

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.320
I bet she does

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.320
I didn't remember that John's dad had that car

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.320
it's pretty cool

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.320
it is pretty cool that he did

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.320
somebody

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.320
somebody else

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.320
I'm not talking about my dad's car

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.320
I thought of literally saying that

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.320
not my dad's car

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.320
well if that car got stolen

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.320
you flip the note over

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.320
I bet you chuckle

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.320
folks were thinking of my dad's car

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.320
by the way I know my dad had a cherry

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.320
trans amp

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.320
but that's not the car I'm thinking of

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320
his was black

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.320
I'm sorry I was misremembering

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.320
his daddy had a black one

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.320
the one from the show

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320
was cherry

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.320
is that right? no it sure ain't

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.320
and is it a movie?

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.320
little Joni

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320
I thought somebody would teach you more about cars

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.320
cherry just means it was real nice

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.320
right

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.320
I haven't seen it

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320
looking at my phone

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.320
probably not timeline wise

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.320
I was looking at my phone

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.320
I was looking at the phone on the wall

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.320
waiting for Jared to call

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.320
there you go

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.320
can I go over and look at the DVD's

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.320
and search that

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.320
little area over there

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.320
17 on

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.320
a 40 for search

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.320
yeah you know that there's

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.320
no clue in the DVD's

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.320
you open them up and they're all smashed

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.320
except one does have

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.320
a note that says go back to the

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.320
hallway

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.320
guys I found something

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320
it says go back to the hallway

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.320
what do you think is going to happen there?

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.320
you want to edit?

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320
do you have an ending spot

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.320
coming down the line?

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.320
I mean we're like 20 minutes from it

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.320
I don't care for that as much

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.320
ok

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.320
well, tough titties

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.320
I'm the DM

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.320
this episode will be out in January

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.320
not December

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.320
yeah you go back to the hallway

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.320
you pick one of those letters back up

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.320
you keep reading the back it says

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.320
I'm not talking about my dad's cherry trans am

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.320
I'm talking about a sprint car that I was building in my garage

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.320
with a sweet

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.320
smokey and the bandit paint job

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.320
well shit guys

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.320
why don't you go take a look at it

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320
why don't you go take a look at it

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.320
why don't you go take a look at it

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320
after Ma's speech

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.320
cut to

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.320
Ma's speech

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.320
you hear a dinner bell

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.320
a big loud dinner bell

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.320
and Ma Pettymore

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.320
you hear a voice in the distance say

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.320
come on y'all

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.320
it's time to eat

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.320
yeah

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.320
Pete runs

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320
you all take your seats

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320
wherever the fuck you want to sit do you sit together

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320
yeah I think so

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.320
Joni just has a cigarette hanging out of her mouth

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.320
unlit

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.320
unlit

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.320
normally Arlo sits at the kids table

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320
he's done it all his life

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.320
and he doesn't know where else to sit

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.320
this time he's kind of

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.320
like you're gonna go sit over there

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.320
Joni who's 24

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.320
and just started sitting at the adults table

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.320
no didn't even sit at the adults table

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.320
the last time she was here

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320
five years ago

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.320
he feels so much injustice

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320
Arlo

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320
you reckon I could sit with y'all

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320
yeah I guess I could do that

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.320
I've got a little flow chart here

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.320
and if at the start of this

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.320
whole cookout you had decided not to

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.320
mingle or investigate Jon's place

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320
and instead just be dicks

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320
you would have been sent to the kitty table

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.320
and

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.320
we would have heard mom's speech about

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.320
45 minutes ago

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320
well we weren't dickheads

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.320
we searched the house

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.320
I didn't want you to be but there were contingencies

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.320
contingencies

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320
contingencies

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320
here you go Arlo and I pulled the chair out for him

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.320
much obliged

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.320
everybody's

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.320
everybody's sitting down too

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320
there are two huge

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.320
long tables that stretch

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320
almost as wide as

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320
Jon's barn which they're in front of

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320
and Ma, it's her 70th birthday

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320
she kind of comes out

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.320
from the kitchen wearing a

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320
long white dress

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.320
and she's beaming

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320
she's smiling to everyone

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320
she shakes some hands

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320
she hugs the little children

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320
and two or three of them follow her

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.320
as she goes and sits down

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320
at the table

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320
and she raises a glass

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320
and she says please, please, everyone, everyone

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320
be seated

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.320
and as everyone sits down

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320
do we all roll for our anti

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.320
yeah roll to see if you can sit

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320
what were you saying before?

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.320
anti-authoritarian

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.320
we were told to do something?

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.320
yeah, if you get told by

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320
we can make this a mechanic actually

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320
if you get told by a person

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320
in authority to do something

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.320
even

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.320
even if you want to do it, you're going to have to roll

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.320
against your oppositional defiance

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.320
which we're going to say

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.320
means Joni

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.320
you're going to have to beat a 40 or above

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320
on all oppositional defiance

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.320
I have to roll above?

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320
you have to roll 40 or below

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.320
I don't know how you want to do it

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.320
you've got a 60% chance

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320
of not doing it

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.320
I have a 60% chance of not doing it

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.320
yes, you two have a 60% chance

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.320
of doing it

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320
but there is an exception in every

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.320
Pettymore's heart

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.320
for Ma, who is not

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320
thank god

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.320
man's authority, she is

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.320
as far as you're all concerned

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.320
a direct agent of the Lord

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.320
like, this is

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320
this is the mouthpiece of

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.320
the universe

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.320
as far as you guys are mostly raised to be concerned

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.320
and she's currently beaming

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.320
and she's tapping her glass

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.320
thank you, thank you all so much

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.320
thank you all so much for coming

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320
here today, for joining me here today

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320
on my birthday

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.320
happy birthday Ma

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.320
she clinks her glass

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320
thank you, thank you, quiet down

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320
it's been so long

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320
it's been so long since

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320
we were all here today as a family

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320
together as a family I mean

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.320
we're here today obviously, listen to this old lady

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320
but it

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320
touches me to see

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320
see all my Pettymore's

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.320
and I know you're not all Pettymore's

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320
you know, we got the extended families here

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320
boo

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.320
laughing

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320
laughing

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.320
laughing or leaving

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.320
laughing

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.320
the Pettymore's, the Pettybones

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.320
the Kenmore's, the Bradleys

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320
the Sanders

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.320
the Joneses, the Joneses Pettymore's

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.320
the Pettymore Joneses

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.320
no matter what your last name is

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320
I'm thankful you came out for my birthday

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.320
you see the Krinklehoff uncle just kind of like

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320
bow his head

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320
laughing

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.320
what did we say his name was?

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.320
Sylvester

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320
I see you Sylvester

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320
you know our families may have had some problems at one time

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320
but Krinklehoff is

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320
well there's worse things in this world than the Krinklehoff

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.320
am I right?

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
clearly

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.320
but I'm also

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320
I'm also sad y'all

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.320
because it didn't used to be so hard

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320
to get this family together

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320
it didn't used to be so hard to get the

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.320
Pettymore's to have a party in Pettymore

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320
Holler woo woo

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320
times have changed

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.320
the outside world is creeping in

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.320
and I understand in some ways so many of our

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.320
cherished young ones

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320
they leave a Holler for a better life

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.320
they think they deserve and they'll find out there

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320
but others, others have been

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320
cruelly taken from us

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320
where is our John Lee?

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.320
where is our Don?

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.320
our Edward?

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320
Aloysius? Where is our Samuel?

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320
somebody goes

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320
I'm right here Ma

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320
she says shut your damn mouth Sammy

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.320
I was talking

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320
about your cousin

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320
Burt you keep your boy in line

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320
sorry Ma

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.320
now I'm asking you

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.320
who took our boys?

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.320
who took Ma's boys?

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320
I glance over at Ron

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:48.320
laughter

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320
she says well it's no great mystery

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320
is it? it doesn't take Dick Tracy

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320
to solve this one it's as plain

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320
as the straps on a skunk

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.320
the pernicious parasites

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.320
who live on the other side of our teat

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.320
have broken the peace

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.320
boo

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.320
who took our boys?

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320
you know who I'm talking about

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.320
who took our boys?

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.320
and every petty more screams

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.320
the McRibs

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.320
the McRibs

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320
the McRibs

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.320
the McRibs

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.320
I want them to never return

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.320
laughter

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.320
we had peace between

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.320
the Hollers for nearly 20 years

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.320
Beauregarde McRib

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.320
has shattered that peace

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320
with no provocation

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.320
boo boo boo

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.320
Ben microscopic

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.320
alright

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.320
quiet down there

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.320
she's like

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.320
she's like Stuart

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.320
a jokeful comment is fine

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.320
but it has to land

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.320
laughter

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.320
also sweetheart

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320
I'm in the middle of something

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320
keep your good boy

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320
in line

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320
laughter

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320
who took our boys?

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.320
McRibs

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320
we had peace for 20 years with the McRibs

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.320
the Beauregard shattered that peace

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.320
what do you think?

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.320
think we wouldn't notice?

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.320
he wouldn't think?

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.320
we'd notice our son's missing

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320
Ma's son's missing

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.320
he thought that we'd let the loss of our kin

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320
go unanswered?

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320
he thought the Pettimores would just let him spill our blood?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320
no

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320
no way

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320
where is John Lee Pettimore?

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320
the McRibs got him

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.320
where is Don D. Pettimore?

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.320
the McRibs got him

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.320
who killed Aloysius?

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320
the McRibs

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320
who killed Edward?

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.320
the McRibs

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.320
who killed Samuel?

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.320
the McRibs did it all

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320
everybody but Joni

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320
give me an alertness roll

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320
oh my god I pass

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320
I fail

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320
a 6 on a 20 because I don't have alertness

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320
you know there's been rumors about

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320
Edward and Aloysius

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320
some of the cousins said they were up to something with John

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320
you're not really sure

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320
but their bodies were found in a shallow grave

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320
not too far from here

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320
just outside the borders of the Hauler

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320
Edward and Aloysius' brother

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
whose name is Jonathan

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.320
when she says who kills Aloysius

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320
who kills Edward

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320
he kind of kicks the ground and spits

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320
but Ma goes on

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320
Noor Guard, Beauregard, that's what they call him

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.320
did he forget his history?

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320
Pettimores have

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320
the

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320
Pettimores have licked the McRibs

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.320
time and time again

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.320
I see why they call him Noor Guard

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320
because he has forgotten

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320
but his hubris won't save him

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320
he's taking on one hell of a debt

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320
and it's a debt that cannot be repaid

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320
in treasure

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.320
it must be paid in blood

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320
everyone knows you won't want to be in debt to a Pettimore

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.320
everybody knows you don't want to be in debt to Ma

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320
you know what we say

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320
gas, grass, or ass

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320
no one rides for free

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320
Big Bo wants to ride your ass for free

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320
no free rides

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.320
no free rides

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.320
no free rides

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.320
I say let his hubris

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.320
be his downfall

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320
let it be the downfall of his whole godforsaken

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320
clan

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.320
Big Bo may have started this feud again

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.320
but Ma is gonna end it

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.320
for good

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320
who's with me

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.320
I'm fucking in

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.320
I'm in

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.320
that's

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320
everybody's murmuring and then shouting

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.320
yes Ma we're with you

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320
we're with you

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320
fuck the McRibs

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.320
no free rides

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.320
fuck Mark Zuckerberg

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.320
and in that moment you hear

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.320
booming up the driveway

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.320
the powerful engine

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.320
of a 77 black

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.320
Pontiac Transam Firebird

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320
which rolls to a stop

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.320
in the driveway

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.320
right in front of John's house

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320
and you'll see who gets out next week

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320
I bet it's Trey

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.320
I think we found

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.320
our clue

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.320
weirdly a letter

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.320
falls from the sky

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.320
delivered by an owl

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320
an owl swoops

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.320
down and it's got another scribbled note

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.320
in John's handwriting

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320
and it says

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.320
I couldn't

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.320
I tried to prepare for every contingency

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320
with my animal friends

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320
contingency

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320
and one of those

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320
contingencies was me forgetting that my daddy

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320
drove the kind of car that I was talking about

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320
Trey drives one it's also not the clue

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
again it's the sprint car

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.320
in my shed

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.320
why don't you go check it out next month

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320
hell yeah dude

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320
hell yeah man

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.320
fuck yeah

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
I cannot wait to fight some fucking McRibs

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.320
bring on the McRibs

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320
them sweet and tangy bastards

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320
I said I did not

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320
want to spoil that joke for you guys

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320
so when the McRib came back for that farewell weekend

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.320
I was like we should maybe go get a picture

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.320
of us eating it for social media right

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.320
and you guys were like

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.320
fuck no

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.320
we should go get some McRibs

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.320
never

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.320
that probably doesn't have anything to do with anything

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.320
we talked about the fish fillet for like 10 minutes

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.320
yeah we did

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320
oh I'd go for a fish fillet

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320
oh man it's not cheddar is it

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320
oh it's not cheddar is it

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320
it's not

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.320

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.320
that I know I can shoot

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.320
in the USA

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320
it's not a question of greed

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320
cause everybody

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.320

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.320
you get what you need

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.320
I need a girl

I need some coffee

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.320
I need some cream

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.320
I need a lovesick slave

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.320

a liberated woman

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.320
and a dog that begs

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.320
I need the will to live

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.320
and a place to die

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.320
don't wanna know how

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.320
but I gotta know why

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.320
in the USA

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.320
