00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
Welcome, y'all,

00:01.800 --> 00:06.440
to the raddest, baddest radio show in the city.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.480
The time is sometime.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.460
The day is July 6, 2022,

00:13.460 --> 00:16.620
a day that may or may not be important.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.760
Who even knows anymore?

00:18.760 --> 00:22.300
And the host is I, Wolf the Dog.

00:22.300 --> 00:27.280
Oooooooowwwwwwww!

00:27.280 --> 00:29.020
I hallett, y'all,

00:29.060 --> 00:31.540
so y'all will hallett me.

00:31.540 --> 00:34.140
This hallettin' with Wolf is from Wren,

00:34.140 --> 00:39.020
AKA Trash Bandicoot, in Manchester, UK.

00:39.020 --> 00:41.340
They tweeted about the show and tagged

00:41.340 --> 00:45.180
at Pretending Pod, a thing you should do too.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.740
Be like the Trash Bandicoot.

00:47.740 --> 00:50.220
You know you have it within.

00:50.220 --> 00:51.680
Wren writes,

00:51.800 --> 00:53.000
Hey, Wolfie.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.480
I've been writing this email since 25 slash 09

00:57.480 --> 01:00.120
slash 2002 too.

01:00.120 --> 01:04.380
That's the 25th of September for you contentioners.

01:04.380 --> 01:09.160
Time's a fuckin' lie, and ADHD is a wild ride.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.240
I just wanna reiterate whatever Mads wrote

01:12.240 --> 01:14.800
in season two, episode 10.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.600
How dare they beat me to thanking Cameron

01:17.600 --> 01:22.240
for introducing the Neo Scum Discord to PTBP

01:22.240 --> 01:27.240
and introducing me to Mayday Roleplay and Penumbra Pod.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.820
You've improved my life,

01:28.820 --> 01:31.400
and I can't wait for you to ruin it.

01:31.400 --> 01:36.080
Neo Scum good, love hugs and kisses, Wren.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.440
Well, damn, thanks to Wren for writing a thing

01:39.440 --> 01:40.780
for me to read.

01:40.780 --> 01:43.240
I don't know what all these random words are

01:43.240 --> 01:45.620
that you made me say, but I'm happy

01:45.660 --> 01:48.900
they seem to make you happy, I think.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.780
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to how,

01:51.780 --> 01:54.500
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter,

01:54.500 --> 01:57.340
tag at PretendingPod on Instagram,

01:57.340 --> 02:00.420
and tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

02:00.420 --> 02:03.660
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app

02:03.660 --> 02:05.580
of your choice and get it in front

02:05.580 --> 02:08.900
of these here hairy wolf eyeballs.

02:08.900 --> 02:13.000
And while we're at it, can I get a quick fuck Elon Musk

02:13.040 --> 02:17.560
from the people in a car or bus or other wheeled vehicle?

02:17.560 --> 02:21.360
And can I get a fuck Mark Zuckerberg from people at work

02:21.360 --> 02:24.280
or from people just sitting in a coffee shop

02:24.280 --> 02:25.800
waiting for their coffee?

02:25.800 --> 02:29.880
And if you're not in a car or bus or other wheeled vehicle

02:29.880 --> 02:34.880
or at work or a quiet coffee shop, congratulations.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.320
Y'all just won the opportunity

02:37.320 --> 02:39.840
to support this show financially

02:39.840 --> 02:43.840
over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.720
There you'll find bonus content,

02:46.720 --> 02:51.720
the chance to name a PTBP NPC or location,

02:52.120 --> 02:57.120
BTS live streams, exclusive merch, and more.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.160
And guess where the links are?

03:00.160 --> 03:01.000
Do it.

03:01.000 --> 03:01.840
Guess.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.460
No, like out loud, come on, don't be shy now.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.240
Say it with me, y'all.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.840
The links are in the show notes.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.480
Where even are the show notes?

03:13.480 --> 03:15.280
Have you ever seen them?

03:15.280 --> 03:17.760
Are they even real?

03:17.760 --> 03:20.920
Have the show notes been reported on?

03:20.920 --> 03:25.680
Because it ain't real if it ain't on the news.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.680
Last time, after a quick flashback to fill in a time gap,

03:31.080 --> 03:33.680
Julius Summers went a tad off the map

03:33.680 --> 03:36.720
and revealed that he's strapped when he pop, pop,

03:37.160 --> 03:38.480
popped a couple of gops

03:38.480 --> 03:41.960
and the brother of the wife of his pops.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.880
And SG, Stevie Godel, revealed the plan

03:45.880 --> 03:49.320
to blackmail their dad with the footage they were acquiring

03:49.320 --> 03:52.880
from officers Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley,

03:52.880 --> 03:56.400
who are new on the Godel payroll and easily swayed

03:56.400 --> 04:00.480
by the daughter of the great Fred Godel himself.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.720
The main issue, seemingly,

04:02.720 --> 04:05.640
is that Julius just thinks he's a bit wet

04:05.640 --> 04:08.560
instead of covered in blood and viscera.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.280
Taking us now to a pearl of a scene

04:11.280 --> 04:13.880
that would make a weaker wolf hurl

04:13.880 --> 04:16.920
and scream for a bowl of curdled cream,

04:16.920 --> 04:20.560
it's altar girl with my life is great

04:20.560 --> 04:23.560
and it's all my fault.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.560
And it's all my fault

04:27.560 --> 04:32.560
Cause my life is great

04:32.560 --> 04:37.560
And it's all my

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Cause my life is great

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
And it's all my fault

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
And it's all my fault

04:59.880 --> 05:03.040
All right, so Thomas and Joe, you both got luck then.

05:03.040 --> 05:03.880
Yeah.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.720
Yeah.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.320
You can see it from my shiny luck token here.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.600
Look at there.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.880
Why don't you flick that in the air for me?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.200
Oh, that's nice.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.160
Joe, how about you?

05:12.160 --> 05:14.000
No, no, no, wait, wait.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.440
Whoa, wow, that was good.

05:17.440 --> 05:18.520
I liked it.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.480
Let's go.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.400
You guys wanna go?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.240
You were just, okay.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.280
You were just taking the temperature

05:22.280 --> 05:23.320
as far as the luck is.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.160
Sorry.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.520
Luca.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.600
It's impossible to explain that joke.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.080
Luca reached over the entire table.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.040
It was very funny.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.400
Oh, it was the, it's four 20 everybody.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.240
Wow.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.480
This is the energy we're bringing to the four 20.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.320
It's the day where you smoke weed and don't ask for help.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
That might be an issue for the gang tonight.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.400
Can you guys, can you let me in?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.080
Let's set the scene real quick.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.040
You guys are on the Northeast corner

06:10.920 --> 06:14.840
in a downtown intersection of the city.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.360
You're just Northeast of the Natcher Hole.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.480
You're in a parking lot.

06:20.560 --> 06:25.560
You are sitting in Cal Colorado's white Mercedes C-Class.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.280
Nice car.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.760
Thanks, you're the one who told us it was nice.

06:34.200 --> 06:39.200
And Julius Summers just pulled up.

06:39.200 --> 06:43.400
Cal Colorado, Beck Wilder and Stevie

06:43.400 --> 06:46.000
were in the Cadillac there

06:46.000 --> 06:48.320
and in the Mercedes C-Class there.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.160
Come on.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.640
Who would ever say that?

06:50.640 --> 06:51.480
What is this?

06:52.520 --> 06:53.840
Ants.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.760
A car that you all don't recognize pulls up.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.800
It's a car driven by Jeremy, the intern who-

06:58.800 --> 06:59.720
Classic character.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.360
Everyone loves him.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.080
He's very, very rattled at all times.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.240
What's he sound like?

07:05.240 --> 07:09.240
His eyes are super wide, that's for sure.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.760
And Julius, oh, you're getting out of the car.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.440
Okay, oh, thank God, oh, thank God.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.160
And we're just sitting in Jeremy's car for a second

07:18.200 --> 07:22.080
after Julius has left and he breathes

07:22.080 --> 07:26.240
for seemingly the first time in a while.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.080
And this is where we leave you

07:28.080 --> 07:31.840
as Jeremy slowly starts pulling out

07:31.840 --> 07:33.880
of the parking spot next to you.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.440
I wave my hands in the air and get behind his car

07:37.440 --> 07:38.840
or not like where I could be hit,

07:38.840 --> 07:40.640
but I'm like, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, hold up, hold up.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.520
Yeah, Julius sees Cal waving

07:43.520 --> 07:47.360
and he like slaps Jeremy's car to get his attention.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.120
It pulls back into the spot.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.440
I go up to the front window

07:50.440 --> 07:52.720
and I like motion for him to roll it down.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.240
Do you think they can hear us?

07:55.240 --> 07:56.600
You mean the other two?

07:57.640 --> 08:00.800
Julius is like standing right there like watching this.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.880
Julius, could you go help Beck

08:02.880 --> 08:07.880
with a weird fungal problem that he has on his body?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.760
No.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.020
Well, he needs someone to vent about to it

08:15.020 --> 08:16.160
and I'm tired of hearing it.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.480
Could you just go be a friend

08:17.480 --> 08:20.320
and listen to him for a minute, over there?

08:20.320 --> 08:23.760
Well, can you unlock your car and I'll hop in?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.680
It's really important that you talk to Beck

08:30.680 --> 08:33.160
about his embarrassing skin problem.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.200
Where are you at?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.800
Am I in the car still?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.480
I don't remember if I got out or not.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.320
I think we ended with-

08:38.320 --> 08:40.520
I think plausibly you could be like standing

08:40.520 --> 08:41.720
outside the passenger seat watching this go on.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.720
Episodes start in different places all the time.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.640
Yeah, that's true.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.360
The reason I clarify though is because

08:47.360 --> 08:48.960
Stevie was doing weird shit.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.840
I don't know if I want to-

08:49.840 --> 08:52.280
Stevie is still in the car, yes.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.880
So you can just roll down the window and talk to him.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.720
That's what I'll do.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.120
Roll down my passenger window.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.360
I'll stick my head in Cal's car.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.240
And I'm kind of grossed out by that, right?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.560
He's covered from head to toe.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.400
Oh, absolutely.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.260
Cal shouts, hey Beck Beck,

09:04.260 --> 09:07.160
don't let him stick his head in the car.

09:07.160 --> 09:12.160
Yeah, Julius, yeah, covered in blood and brain matter.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.540
His nose is bleeding and you can see a shoulder,

09:17.540 --> 09:19.580
like a gunshot in his shoulder.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.720
Jesus, is it healed?

09:21.720 --> 09:23.400
Like, has it been attended to medically?

09:23.400 --> 09:27.040
It happened less than an hour ago.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.800
It happened so fast.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.680
It happened, how long did it take me to get from can to-

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
Very little time.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.200
Jeremy drove very quickly.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.640
So speaking to Jeremy, Cal's like, okay,

09:36.640 --> 09:40.160
I don't think Julius is in much position to relay-

09:40.160 --> 09:41.000
Headphones, boys.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.320
What's going on here?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.580
So as quickly as possible,

09:43.580 --> 09:45.580
can you tell me what the fuck happened?

09:46.880 --> 09:48.040
Yeah, get the fuck out.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.340
I love you.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.180
Bye.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.000
Wait, but, oh, nevermind.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.400
Okay.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.280
Okay, so we hear gunshots, multiple gunshots

10:00.280 --> 10:03.000
and nobody went in, obviously, but we called the cops

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
and Julius came out of Type's office with blood all over me.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
And over and over and over and over, beep, beep, beep, beep.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.680
And then he just came out and then everyone was taking

10:18.680 --> 10:23.680
videos and photos and it was so sad and it was just like,

10:26.600 --> 10:31.600
he's just like, he's got a gun on him and he's dangerous.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.040
He killed the high-freaking.

10:36.560 --> 10:41.320
If he looks up, he would see that Cal has been filming

10:41.320 --> 10:42.560
this all on his phone.

10:45.720 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, no, he's in no state to try to roll there.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.760
I don't know what to do.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.960
He told me to drive him to you guys

10:56.920 --> 10:58.720
and he knew where you were.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.400
And so I drove him because, you know, gun and murder

11:03.400 --> 11:06.000
and he's covered in blood and he thinks he's just wet.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.640
Wow, yes.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.720
Who kills their uncle?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.120
Who shoots anyone?

11:12.120 --> 11:12.960
Wait, what?

11:12.960 --> 11:16.160
It's too early to speculate, but Type may not have been

11:16.160 --> 11:19.200
the man you thought he was, if what you thought he was

11:19.200 --> 11:21.120
was a good man.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.840
Cal, that is not the reaction that I was expecting from you.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.920
Well, Jeremy, unfortunately.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.120
You're saying that the victim was a bad guy?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.920
Well, yes, I think objectively.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.840
He was a bad man who did not care about the news.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.600
He was ill-suited for his position.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.760
I'm not happy he died, but Jeremy,

11:39.760 --> 11:42.320
big things are going on today, strange things.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.680
We have reason to believe Type was involved

11:44.680 --> 11:47.240
with corrupt police officers.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.360
That doesn't mean, that doesn't, oh.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.040
Working for the Godel Corporation,

11:51.040 --> 11:54.640
they stole our footage of the most insane news story

11:54.640 --> 11:56.520
that I have ever personally covered.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.360
Type was a part of them, Julius is now too.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.440
I guess we already were, but we need your help.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.800
No, no, I'm not fucking, wait.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.920
Roll persuade. Yeah, I was like,

12:07.920 --> 12:10.400
I'm so sorry, I meant to persuade you

12:10.400 --> 12:11.560
that we need your help.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.000
He's gonna pass with a 16.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.960
This is contested?

12:15.960 --> 12:16.800
Yeah.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.000
I pass with a 67.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.320
Oh, you done got him.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.080
No, absolutely not.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.840
My duty is to the news,

12:25.840 --> 12:28.520
cause I'm an intern and I don't work for money,

12:28.520 --> 12:30.600
I work for truth.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.640
Yes, that's right.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.560
Cal is like, tears are in his eyes

12:36.560 --> 12:40.120
and he's swelling with pride.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.840
And he says, God damn it, Jeremy.

12:42.840 --> 12:43.720
Yeah.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.360
That's what I'm fucking talking about.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.640
That's what I'm talking about.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.720
That's what I'm talking about.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.240
That's what I'm talking about.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.920
Beck, you might wanna get away from Julius.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.840
All right, let's get him back.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.040
That was fun.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.880
Thomas, if you could walk out real quick.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.720
Yeah.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.360
The TV looks at Julius's blood-covered head

13:04.360 --> 13:08.880
that is through the window and without missing a beat,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.480
Julius, what the fuck happened?

13:10.480 --> 13:14.560
And I need you back to roll a grip check

13:14.560 --> 13:19.560
for this face being so close to you.

13:21.120 --> 13:26.120
This man being so uninterested in his own...

13:27.400 --> 13:28.240
I failed.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.480
Bodily health.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.680
That's a 91.

13:30.680 --> 13:34.880
I need my other character sheet.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.880
That's hilarious.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.080
Hey, while you're doing that, Beck.

13:47.080 --> 13:47.920
Yeah.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.960
Joe, if you could roll a grip check for me and fail.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.760
And now if you could roll a...

13:52.760 --> 13:54.200
Did you fail?

13:54.200 --> 13:58.720
If you could roll a nothing, you just lose one.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.960
Lose one grip as this face is just inching near you.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.840
You were like...

14:03.840 --> 14:06.760
Utterly grossed out just because it's blood and viscera.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.280
But then I see that there's maybe a bullet wound

14:09.280 --> 14:10.600
in the shoulder and I'm like,

14:10.600 --> 14:12.960
oh fuck, this could be a mortal wound.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.160
He could be dying in front of me.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.480
Holy shit.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.160
Julius, my dude, I think you're bleeding out, dude.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.800
Julius looks down at it.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.600
I mean, I told you, I just got wet.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.960
I mean, I'll dry off, it's fine.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.280
I mean, I think you will dry off eventually

14:29.280 --> 14:30.480
because of death.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.440
There's no more to be coming out, yeah.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.320
Julius is literally looking like,

14:35.320 --> 14:37.320
what the fuck are you talking about?

14:37.320 --> 14:38.800
Luke, how many hit points do you have?

14:38.800 --> 14:39.640
Two.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.920
I sneeze and headbutt.

14:42.920 --> 14:43.760
Oh shit.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.120
Julius dies.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.400
I'm gonna put my hand past his head and pound on the roof

14:52.400 --> 14:55.840
and Carol, we gotta get him to a hospital.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.840
At that exact moment,

14:57.840 --> 15:01.480
he is yelling something equally loud at you.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.360
Which was what?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.880
I believe he said, Beck.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.600
Yeah.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.600
Oh, Thomas.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.440
Tommy.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.600
Tommy Pickles.

15:17.600 --> 15:18.920
Tommy Pickles was the first Tommy

15:18.920 --> 15:20.040
that popped into my head too.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.440
Really?

15:21.440 --> 15:22.920
For sure though.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.640
Beck, Beck, get away from him.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.880
And at that exact moment, Beck is yelling back at you.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.320
We gotta get him to a hospital.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.640
Cal, come on, get in the car.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.480
Put him in this car, it's already ruined

15:33.480 --> 15:35.120
and Jeremy is on our side.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.200
Beck, I love you like a son,

15:38.200 --> 15:41.240
but if you let him in my car, I'll be disappointed.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.200
I don't know.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.800
Is our cherry removable?

15:43.800 --> 15:46.560
The thing that we've been running around, the siren light?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.920
Yeah, it literally just is like suction cups on top.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.960
I pull it out of like the dashboard or out of the glove box

15:52.000 --> 15:55.640
and I toss it over the car to Cal.

15:55.640 --> 15:56.920
All right, we'll get him in that car.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.240
We just gotta go, we just gotta go.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.360
Cal catches it pretty nimbly.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.200
Oh yeah?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.320
I gotta imagine he was like.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.160
Let's get some athletics checks.

16:04.160 --> 16:08.200
See how smoothly this very intense,

16:08.200 --> 16:10.360
very serious situation goes.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.760
I guess it has been a while since high school baseball

16:15.760 --> 16:20.360
and Cal fumbles, I do not pass either.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.920
So it's already like a wild throw.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.760
It's a wild pitch off to the side and you reach out

16:27.760 --> 16:30.920
way for it and it touches your fingers though.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.280
So you know deep down you could have caught it.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.140
Just like the story if it gets away from us.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.000
Julius, man, we gotta get into that car

16:42.000 --> 16:42.960
that you just got out of.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.320
We gotta get you back into that one

16:44.320 --> 16:45.800
and we gotta get you to the hospital, dude.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.160
You're gonna die.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.000
What?

16:49.000 --> 16:52.480
Beck wants to, he feels like he needs to snap Julius

16:52.480 --> 16:54.600
into it and he wants to poke the wound

16:54.600 --> 16:56.400
to see if that elicits a response.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.600
Holy fucking shit.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.400
When he reaches out for you, do you counter?

17:02.400 --> 17:04.040
No.

17:04.040 --> 17:04.880
Poke.

17:04.880 --> 17:05.960
Lose one hit point.

17:05.960 --> 17:06.800
Oh!

17:06.800 --> 17:07.840
Fuck.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.080
You killed Julius.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.240
Can I use your pencil?

17:12.120 --> 17:12.960
Thank you.

17:12.960 --> 17:13.800
No actually.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.040
That would take me to one hit point.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.220
Let's have you roll con to see if you lose

17:17.220 --> 17:18.060
one hit point here.

17:18.060 --> 17:19.300
Roll con.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.260
Can it be taken into account that I wasn't

17:21.260 --> 17:24.500
like trying to injure, I was trying to shock.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.900
56 on a 55.

17:28.820 --> 17:29.900
You did both.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.420
Well did it?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.260
Did it shock?

17:34.260 --> 17:36.020
Do you respond to that other than?

17:36.020 --> 17:38.740
Julius Summers vomits through the window.

17:38.740 --> 17:39.580
Into the car.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.260
Into the car, onto your lap,

17:41.260 --> 17:44.020
into the white Mercedes C-Class.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.580
Now do you believe me, dude?

17:45.580 --> 17:46.660
That's a wound, man.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.140
You're injured.

17:48.140 --> 17:49.420
Julius, when you look down,

17:49.420 --> 17:52.540
you see yourself absolutely covered in blood

17:52.540 --> 17:56.380
and you are in a wild amount of pain

17:56.380 --> 17:58.780
seemingly out of fucking nowhere.

17:58.780 --> 18:02.900
What the fuck?

18:02.900 --> 18:04.300
Yeah, yeah, exactly my dude.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.140
Get in the car.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.580
He stumbles into Jeremy's car.

18:07.580 --> 18:10.080
Cal slaps the cherry on top,

18:10.080 --> 18:11.940
slaps Jeremy in the face.

18:12.820 --> 18:13.660
Thank you.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.900
Get him to the hospital.

18:14.940 --> 18:16.980
Do it for old lady news.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.540
Absolutely, sir, yes sir.

18:19.540 --> 18:22.260
Hand to my, hand to my, hand to my forehead,

18:22.260 --> 18:23.460
fingers flat.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.660
Julius hears like get him to the hospital

18:25.660 --> 18:26.900
like they're not coming with me

18:26.900 --> 18:28.260
and he gets out of the car.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.260
We gotta solve it together.

18:34.260 --> 18:36.780
Julius, you know, the last time you tried to pull this,

18:36.780 --> 18:38.520
no offense, we lost God.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.580
So why don't you just go to the fucking hospital?

18:41.580 --> 18:42.780
If I recall correctly,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.380
you lost God when I was in the hospital.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.300
Who knows what happened when Julius.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.380
Good point, I will not be going to the hospital.

18:50.380 --> 18:54.020
And he starts to just kind of try to wipe himself off

18:54.020 --> 18:57.480
and like holds the bullet wound.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.620
Go ahead and roll a first aid on yourself

18:59.620 --> 19:03.300
if you have it to try to look around and find.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.180
Fail again.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.660
Are you excited about that?

19:06.660 --> 19:07.500
No.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.620
Do you have any first aid back there?

19:09.620 --> 19:13.020
You find some fast food napkins in Jeremy's glove box.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.520
He shoves it in the wound.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.420
I turn around to Stevie.

19:16.420 --> 19:19.060
Stevie, is there any chance that you know like

19:19.060 --> 19:21.100
maybe how to stop the bleeding on this?

19:21.100 --> 19:24.200
Hey, I do have one luck that I have written down.

19:25.380 --> 19:29.120
It's been scratched out and then replaced, but I have it.

19:31.020 --> 19:33.500
That's extremely confusing based on the conversation

19:33.500 --> 19:35.780
we had at the top of the app.

19:35.780 --> 19:37.700
Okay, yeah, then I don't, nevermind.

19:40.020 --> 19:42.260
I believe you, but it sounds like a lie.

19:43.860 --> 19:46.380
I need you guys to answer a question for me

19:46.380 --> 19:49.960
because I rolled for first aid.

19:49.960 --> 19:52.360
I think base is 30, is that correct?

19:52.360 --> 19:53.200
10.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.020
10, yeah.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.140
Okay, so I gave Stevie a plus 20.

19:56.140 --> 20:01.140
I rolled both D10s and one said 80

20:01.540 --> 20:04.460
and the other one rolled off the table.

20:04.460 --> 20:05.300
Reroll them both.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.700
Am I supposed to reroll them both?

20:07.700 --> 20:08.520
Yeah.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.360
Yes, of course.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.300
As we've always played.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.260
So reroll both.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.740
Okay, so then I rerolled both and I got a 69.

20:15.740 --> 20:16.900
That's a critical success.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.500
That's good news.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.740
He's back to full health.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
So Stevie is like, well, the only time that I ever had

20:28.400 --> 20:32.540
any sort of like first aid training was this one summer camp

20:32.540 --> 20:36.740
where we just learned how to like dress like bullet wounds

20:36.740 --> 20:38.080
in the field.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.380
What kind of summer camp was that?

20:40.380 --> 20:41.700
Rich people.

20:42.140 --> 20:42.980
Oh, okay.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.740
I'll have to do a story about that.

20:45.740 --> 20:46.580
Good news, Stevie.

20:46.580 --> 20:47.560
I think it's a bullet wound.

20:47.560 --> 20:48.760
Summer's camp me.

20:52.220 --> 20:53.060
Scamp?

20:55.300 --> 20:57.980
He leans his shoulder towards Stevie,

20:57.980 --> 21:00.420
points at it with the napkin sticking out of it.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.540
So she hops out of the Mercedes C class.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.660
She rummages through Cal's trunk.

21:05.660 --> 21:07.500
Which has a full first aid kit probably.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.500
Which has a full first aid kit in the back of it

21:09.500 --> 21:12.900
and she pulls that out, goes over to Julius.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.200
Okay, I'm gonna need you to just kind of lean up

21:15.200 --> 21:19.060
against the car and just, you know, bite down on this.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.940
Julius lays down and then bites on this.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.340
You get three hit points.

21:24.340 --> 21:25.380
Hell yes.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.700
Nice.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.180
What is your max, Luke?

21:28.180 --> 21:29.020
10.

21:29.020 --> 21:29.840
And you're at four?

21:29.840 --> 21:30.980
It's like I never poked you.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.140
What do you need from me, Mr. Colorado?

21:35.140 --> 21:37.460
What does lady journalism need?

21:37.460 --> 21:39.660
I guess we need you to watch the exits.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.820
We can only cover so many points of entryways

21:41.820 --> 21:44.580
to the subway to watch the meeting.

21:44.580 --> 21:46.540
So if you can keep them, you know,

21:46.540 --> 21:48.260
if you can take up the rear.

21:48.260 --> 21:49.100
Subway?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.060
Eat fresh.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.260
We're meeting Stevie.

21:52.260 --> 21:53.740
Julius accepts that as an answer.

21:53.740 --> 21:54.580
He did?

21:58.980 --> 22:00.860
He's back, baby.

22:00.860 --> 22:04.840
We're meeting, or Stevie is meeting, the gops.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.340
The ones who stole our footage

22:06.340 --> 22:07.440
and she's gonna recover it.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.280
How many?

22:08.280 --> 22:09.420
Just the two, as far as I know.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.260
Which ones?

22:10.260 --> 22:11.740
As far as we know, it's the guys

22:11.740 --> 22:12.700
that we went to the apartments of.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.580
Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.

22:15.580 --> 22:16.940
Oh, okay.

22:16.940 --> 22:19.540
Beck is still kind of side-eyeing Julius.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.860
Not sure if he's gonna die or not.

22:24.580 --> 22:27.180
If you don't have good medicine skills,

22:27.180 --> 22:30.020
then yeah, you might be very much still worried about that.

22:30.020 --> 22:31.940
But he's not bleeding.

22:31.940 --> 22:35.620
Blood isn't coming out of the hole anymore.

22:35.660 --> 22:38.540
Whereas before, it seemed with every heartbeat,

22:38.540 --> 22:41.280
there was just like a little glug.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.480
Can you look at your phone and text me back?

22:43.480 --> 22:44.320
Yeah, absolutely.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.740
Here's my phone, looking at it right now.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.540
It says, do you like me, yes or no?

22:50.460 --> 22:51.460
Luke, roll grip.

22:51.460 --> 22:53.980
Not to lose any or gain any,

22:53.980 --> 22:55.860
but to know whether you...

22:55.860 --> 22:58.180
I got a 13 on a 23.

22:58.180 --> 23:03.180
Okay, with your grip and check, you do.

23:03.420 --> 23:04.240
I do.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.080
Yeah.

23:05.380 --> 23:06.220
Now we're married.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.880
You're meeting Richard Riley and Wilson Wiley.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.480
Yeah, because they have the footage,

23:13.480 --> 23:15.800
so I just need it back.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.920
And that way I can...

23:17.920 --> 23:19.280
That way I can...

23:19.280 --> 23:20.200
You're not gonna meet him.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.520
Blackmail my dad.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.720
Well, no, of course we're not gonna meet them.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.600
We're gonna ambush them while they meet Stevie.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.440
Yeah.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.260
That's the plan.

23:27.260 --> 23:30.960
Julius picks a piece of brain off his face and says,

23:30.960 --> 23:34.120
this is as close as you're gonna get to meeting them.

23:35.920 --> 23:36.980
Oh, shit.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.960
Julius, what do you mean?

23:41.960 --> 23:42.800
They're dead.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.640
Both of them?

23:44.800 --> 23:45.640
Yeah.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.760
Yeah.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.240
They were, well, they were at Cannes.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.640
I have so many questions,

23:52.640 --> 23:54.180
but I think the first one is,

23:54.180 --> 23:56.480
did you get the footage back from them then?

23:56.480 --> 23:57.520
No.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.360
What do you mean no?

23:58.360 --> 23:59.360
Where was the footage?

24:01.280 --> 24:03.440
Well, I'll be honest with you.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.800
It all went down so fast.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.760
And then I think I just broke.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.400
You killed them.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.240
Yeah.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.360
Holy shit.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.360
And Julius is like a thousand yard stare.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.680
You killed Tife too, right?

24:16.680 --> 24:17.800
Yeah.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.920
Hey, Brack, he killed Tife.

24:19.920 --> 24:20.760
He killed...

24:20.760 --> 24:21.600
Tife.

24:21.600 --> 24:22.520
You killed your uncle?

24:22.520 --> 24:23.360
Yeah.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.320
Well, he was gonna destroy the footage too, I think.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.120
He didn't want it out.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.760
He didn't want it out.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.400
I think Beck is like sort of in shock.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.800
Like this is too much.

24:36.800 --> 24:37.640
Do we need to roll grip or?

24:37.640 --> 24:39.280
Yeah, if you could both roll grip.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.520
Cow passes just fine.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.720
20 on a 41.

24:46.720 --> 24:47.680
I got a 69.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.480
Holy fucking shit.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.320
Hell yeah.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.800
That's my first 69 in a long time.

24:51.800 --> 24:55.240
All right, you're gonna gain a D4 of grip back.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.080
Ooh.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.240
That's a four.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.080
That's a four.

24:59.080 --> 24:59.900
Hell yeah.

24:59.900 --> 25:00.740
Oh, nice.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.620
It says four on every side of that.

25:02.620 --> 25:03.460
Yeah.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.940
Beck is able to internalize this real quick and easy.

25:07.940 --> 25:11.540
What is this resolve that Beck has attained?

25:11.540 --> 25:14.700
It's that, I mean, as crazy as this all is,

25:14.700 --> 25:18.020
it's tied up some loose ends and answered some questions,

25:18.020 --> 25:20.580
even though others are now posed.

25:20.580 --> 25:22.780
But it's like kind of weirdly making sense.

25:22.780 --> 25:23.620
Yeah.

25:23.620 --> 25:26.780
So Julius, like, holy fuck, you killed him.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.100
But you don't have the footage?

25:29.100 --> 25:30.300
Where'd you get the gun?

25:30.780 --> 25:31.600
Don't worry about that.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.440
Who shot you?

25:32.440 --> 25:34.260
Well, one of them.

25:34.260 --> 25:35.580
It was a player, one of them.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.140
RR or WW.

25:37.140 --> 25:38.740
Or, or Tife?

25:38.740 --> 25:41.300
No, Tife didn't have a gun.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.660
And he looks even farther than a thousand yards.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.500
Holy shit.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.500
Could I, could I?

25:49.500 --> 25:50.340
Wouldn't even say it.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.120
Could I see your gun?

25:52.120 --> 25:52.960
No.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.780
Please?

25:54.660 --> 25:55.500
No.

25:56.780 --> 25:59.660
He like pulls up his shirt for a second

25:59.700 --> 26:04.540
and flashes you and you see two guns on it, on either hip.

26:04.540 --> 26:05.820
And then he puts his shirt back down.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.340
Holy shit.

26:07.340 --> 26:08.620
Okay, so.

26:08.620 --> 26:12.300
I'm sure if we went back to the stationers,

26:12.300 --> 26:16.160
they were meeting with Tife, you know, the cops.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.000
Yeah.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.980
So he was bad, right?

26:18.980 --> 26:20.540
Yes, he was a bad man.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.740
A bad man who hated the news.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.660
I mean, I wasn't there, but yeah,

26:24.660 --> 26:26.900
it sounds like you did what you had to.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.420
I mean, they're not like bad.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.140
I mean, they just do whatever the Godot company

26:31.140 --> 26:34.380
wants them to do that doesn't make him like necessarily.

26:34.380 --> 26:36.740
They follow orders without thinking, no matter what?

26:36.740 --> 26:38.900
Exactly, yeah, like you said, yeah.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.180
They're just following orders?

26:40.180 --> 26:41.340
Yeah, agreed.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.500
It's like, what's the big deal?

26:42.500 --> 26:43.780
Can I hear that, Steve?

26:43.780 --> 26:45.180
Oh shit.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.360
A serious look, yeah.

26:46.360 --> 26:49.940
Right, okay, so if the, okay, huh.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.980
And Jeremy's like, wait, wait, okay, so like,

26:54.740 --> 26:55.780
if all of this is happening,

26:55.780 --> 26:57.580
do you guys need coffee or anything?

26:58.420 --> 27:02.660
I think we will be able to grab some coffee

27:02.660 --> 27:05.460
on our way through the door, back at the station.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.480
Real quick, back to Stevie.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.500
The Godot company is bad.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.420
Not all Godot's are bad.

27:11.420 --> 27:12.880
You're not bad, Stevie.

27:14.380 --> 27:17.000
You could be, depending on what you choose to do.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.780
They like smile.

27:18.780 --> 27:19.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:19.620 --> 27:21.500
But you're not bad because you're a Godot.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.340
Yeah, not yet.

27:23.860 --> 27:26.780
Exactly, none of us are bad yet.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.780
I used to be.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.740
I used to be a good guy.

27:31.740 --> 27:35.440
I used to be a good guy, then I went insane.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.500
Hey, Zach, will you check your phone?

27:41.420 --> 27:44.860
Julius is texting while you guys are talking.

27:45.940 --> 27:49.080
If we go back to the, Julius is, I mean, like,

27:49.080 --> 27:52.100
do people know other than Jeremy, like, this all happened?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.380
Like, is there, is it a crime scene?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.140
Is it, are there gonna be a lot of cops there?

27:56.140 --> 27:57.260
He seems lost in his phone.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.940
We've got to accept that there's probably a lot of cops

27:59.940 --> 28:01.700
and a crime scene environment there,

28:01.700 --> 28:03.640
but we're the perfect cover.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.000
We're Can News.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
We are Can News.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.700
We've got to come in and cover it, you know?

28:08.700 --> 28:09.720
That's, they'll believe that.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.400
I'm Cal Colorado.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.880
Do we know that the footage is there?

28:13.880 --> 28:15.660
Stevie, were you supposed to do the handoff here

28:15.660 --> 28:17.340
or was this money being exchanged

28:17.340 --> 28:19.140
and then you were gonna go get the footage somewhere?

28:19.140 --> 28:21.020
No, they were bringing the footage here.

28:21.020 --> 28:22.140
So maybe it's on them.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.780
I mean, it could be, it's,

28:23.780 --> 28:25.660
if they were gonna meet you guys,

28:25.660 --> 28:27.900
it was probably in Tife's office.

28:27.900 --> 28:28.740
Yeah.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.560
I mean, maybe.

28:29.560 --> 28:30.700
I didn't look too hard.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.900
Also, I don't know if there'll be cops there or not.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.620
Kind of depends.

28:35.620 --> 28:38.260
And he's like staring at his phone, waiting for-

28:38.260 --> 28:40.980
Depends on what, Julius?

28:40.980 --> 28:42.860
Okay, this is the last one I'm sending.

28:42.860 --> 28:44.200
Julius says.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.520
Okay, Julius, like, is staring at his phone for a while

28:49.520 --> 28:51.820
and you see it kind of deeing.

28:51.820 --> 28:52.780
Synesthesia.

28:52.780 --> 28:53.940
Yeah, I got synesthesia.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.380
I heard your pussy stink.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.180
I can't do it.

29:00.060 --> 29:03.260
Guys, I, I want to tell you-

29:03.260 --> 29:04.100
That's just a tweet.

29:04.100 --> 29:05.660
I didn't make that up or anything.

29:07.420 --> 29:08.740
That would have been nuts.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.760
Yeah, I'm not that good.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.660
Guys, I want to, I want to tell you something,

29:13.660 --> 29:18.540
but if I tell you, it's nothing's ever gonna be the same.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.580
And you don't take it lightly.

29:21.580 --> 29:26.540
I, I don't, but nothing's been the same

29:26.540 --> 29:28.900
for a couple days now.

29:29.820 --> 29:30.660
You know what I mean?

29:30.660 --> 29:32.380
Yeah, I think we were past samesies.

29:32.380 --> 29:35.540
Yeah, the It Pit pretty much did it in for that.

29:35.540 --> 29:36.500
Okay, well.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.020
Well, do you, I, you know,

29:41.020 --> 29:43.420
I don't normally carry guns around, right?

29:43.420 --> 29:44.260
I wasn't sure.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.100
Yeah, yeah, no, no.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.740
You didn't really seem like a big gun guy before,

29:46.740 --> 29:49.780
except for, you know, those cannons

29:49.820 --> 29:52.540
and your, and your, that you call thighs.

29:52.540 --> 29:56.060
Right, I've had these, I've had these guns a long time.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.700
You are a gun guy.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.620
Well, I have to be in my line of work.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.300
Beck is just staring at you.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.700
What, what, what's your line of work, son?

30:05.940 --> 30:07.780
Well, it's technically government.

30:11.020 --> 30:16.020
I work for, it's like maybe kind of like the FBI,

30:16.900 --> 30:21.900
but for, you know, the shit we've seen the past few days.

30:24.100 --> 30:24.940
Extreme.

30:27.820 --> 30:31.660
Basically, that's, that's the closest I'd compare it to.

30:32.740 --> 30:35.500
I don't know, I just have a connection that,

30:35.500 --> 30:39.220
that pays me and tells me to, to do things and...

30:40.980 --> 30:42.380
Can I, can I human this?

30:42.380 --> 30:43.220
Yeah.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.060
70 on a 70.

30:45.060 --> 30:45.900
How does he feel?

30:45.900 --> 30:47.860
Do you think he's telling the truth?

30:47.860 --> 30:50.260
You know, Julius, you've had a really tough day

30:50.260 --> 30:52.620
and I believe that you believe

30:52.620 --> 30:57.620
that you're in the X-Files or whatever, but yeah.

30:57.620 --> 31:00.420
I mean, so why don't we just get back to the can building

31:00.420 --> 31:03.180
and try to find the footage?

31:03.180 --> 31:08.180
And we can talk all about your little alien adventures

31:08.340 --> 31:09.180
or whatever.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.020
Okay, well, just so we know,

31:11.020 --> 31:16.020
you guys are kinda, I mean, kinda in now too, in on it.

31:16.220 --> 31:18.260
So don't tell anybody.

31:18.260 --> 31:19.980
Are you, Julius, are you telling me

31:19.980 --> 31:21.900
that you have like an assignment?

31:21.900 --> 31:22.740
What do you, yeah.

31:22.740 --> 31:25.260
Do you know more about what's going on than we do?

31:25.260 --> 31:28.820
Well, I know that we need that footage

31:28.820 --> 31:32.380
and I need to kill Gops.

31:34.380 --> 31:35.980
We agreed we need that footage.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.900
What do you want the footage for?

31:38.140 --> 31:38.980
Same reason you do.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.540
To show to the world.

31:40.540 --> 31:41.380
Yes.

31:41.380 --> 31:42.700
I want to human that.

31:42.700 --> 31:43.540
Roll it, baby.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.380
Nice.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.700
36.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.940
How does he feel?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.780
Julius is telling the truth.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.540
Fuck yeah, baby.

31:51.540 --> 31:52.780
Holy shit.

31:52.780 --> 31:53.620
Okay.

31:54.620 --> 31:59.020
We find the footage and we put it out on the TikTok.

31:59.020 --> 32:01.780
Yeah, are you like a real producer too though?

32:01.780 --> 32:05.660
Beck sees Julius texting they need that footage.

32:05.660 --> 32:09.660
Beck sees Julius texting they know and sending it.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.980
Well, Ty was my uncle,

32:14.980 --> 32:19.460
but no, I never had any real training.

32:19.460 --> 32:22.980
It was, I mean, I'm lucky that he was my uncle.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.620
That's how I got the job, but.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.860
Well, we, yeah, we all knew that part.

32:26.860 --> 32:28.340
Probably could have clocked that a little sooner,

32:28.340 --> 32:29.460
you're right, yeah.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.700
No, no, no, I mean, that was, yeah.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.620
But at the end of the day, I feel like I, you know,

32:34.620 --> 32:36.860
I have the same kind of heart that you guys do.

32:36.860 --> 32:38.100
I want the truth.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.340
I want people to know the truth.

32:40.340 --> 32:43.900
Well, at least enough truth that they won't, you know,

32:43.900 --> 32:44.740
go nuts.

32:46.620 --> 32:47.940
You mean the whole truth?

32:47.940 --> 32:49.140
In a lot of cases.

32:50.180 --> 32:53.380
In this case, we just rolled about this.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.740
Yeah, Julius, yes.

32:58.940 --> 33:01.380
Definitely in this case.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.220
Julius text.

33:03.220 --> 33:04.860
Julius, who are you texting?

33:04.860 --> 33:08.900
We can call her X for X file.

33:10.060 --> 33:14.340
If that's, you know, that's the easiest way to refer to it.

33:14.340 --> 33:17.340
Have you ever met X in real life?

33:19.060 --> 33:22.220
Yeah, she's my roommate.

33:22.220 --> 33:23.060
Oh shit.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.860
Okay, so like, but this is like a source

33:26.860 --> 33:28.260
that wants to remain anonymous.

33:28.260 --> 33:30.020
What's her real name?

33:30.020 --> 33:31.540
We'll need to get clearance to interview her

33:31.540 --> 33:32.940
and everything for this.

33:33.580 --> 33:35.340
I don't know that that'll be happening,

33:35.340 --> 33:37.700
but I do have good news.

33:38.580 --> 33:39.980
She's got the footage.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.340
X has the footage?

33:41.340 --> 33:42.940
She just texted me.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.940
Like at your place?

33:44.940 --> 33:46.420
Is X gonna give it to us?

33:46.420 --> 33:47.260
What?

33:47.260 --> 33:48.100
Ha ha.

33:48.100 --> 33:48.940
Pfft.

33:48.940 --> 33:49.780
Pfft.

33:49.780 --> 33:50.620
Ha ha ha.

33:50.620 --> 33:51.460
Pfft.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.300
Ha ha ha.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.140
Ha ha ha.

33:53.140 --> 33:53.980
Ha ha ha.

33:53.980 --> 33:54.820
Ha ha ha.

33:54.820 --> 33:55.660
Ha ha ha.

33:55.660 --> 33:56.500
Ha ha ha.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.340
Ha ha ha.

33:57.340 --> 33:58.180
Ha ha ha.

33:58.220 --> 34:00.140
And it's all my fault.

34:02.540 --> 34:04.380
Is that enough to be the end of the episode?

34:04.380 --> 34:05.220
That's the end, right?

34:05.220 --> 34:06.060
That's the end.

34:06.060 --> 34:07.100
Unfortunately for...

34:07.100 --> 34:08.580
We're doing two episodes, so.

34:11.020 --> 34:12.340
Was that enough time?

34:12.340 --> 34:13.980
It's like 50 minutes.

34:13.980 --> 34:15.180
Oh, all together?

34:15.180 --> 34:16.020
Yeah.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.660
So it ended down to like 30?

34:17.660 --> 34:19.860
No, like easy 42.

34:19.860 --> 34:20.700
33.

34:20.700 --> 34:22.620
So unfortunately that can't be the end.

34:22.620 --> 34:23.540
Yeah, sorry Joe.

34:23.540 --> 34:24.380
Ha ha ha.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.060
You should end it there and then have like

34:29.060 --> 34:32.220
still like 20 more minutes of episode after.

34:32.220 --> 34:35.420
Play the music and then here's the rest of the episode.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.260
Yeah.

34:37.940 --> 34:40.980
You can, yeah, just like play the first 10 seconds.

34:40.980 --> 34:42.060
Not a full fucking song.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.140
Nobody would listen to it.

34:44.140 --> 34:45.060
Two seconds.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.500
Yeah, I think she's gonna give it to us.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.220
And he...

34:53.780 --> 34:54.940
X?

34:54.940 --> 34:57.780
X gonna give it to us.

34:57.780 --> 35:02.780
But he texts back a house emoji or Z, question mark.

35:04.980 --> 35:06.540
The house.

35:06.540 --> 35:09.580
Okay, you guys wanna see my house?

35:09.580 --> 35:10.500
What's Z?

35:10.500 --> 35:12.460
Secret meeting spot.

35:12.460 --> 35:14.140
Oh, for your little alien club?

35:15.620 --> 35:16.460
It's, well...

35:16.460 --> 35:18.500
What are you guys, like an internet discussion group

35:18.500 --> 35:19.540
or something or?

35:19.540 --> 35:20.700
Do you have like training?

35:20.700 --> 35:22.220
Did somebody train you?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.060
Peck.

35:24.260 --> 35:25.540
Come on.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.380
I mean...

35:28.180 --> 35:29.940
I'll tell you guys the full story later

35:29.940 --> 35:33.020
but I mean, unless you wanna hear it right now.

35:33.020 --> 35:34.100
Ha ha ha ha.

35:37.180 --> 35:38.540
Yeah, tell it to us on the way.

35:38.540 --> 35:39.380
Okay.

35:39.380 --> 35:40.220
This is perfect.

35:40.220 --> 35:41.980
Okay, so what cars are going where?

35:41.980 --> 35:43.420
Where is Jeremy going?

35:43.420 --> 35:45.940
Beck is FaceTiming Julius

35:45.940 --> 35:49.060
who is in Jeremy's car following behind us.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.180
Or no, we're following them

35:50.180 --> 35:51.700
because you've gotta lead us to your house.

35:52.540 --> 35:53.380
Who am I in the car with?

35:53.380 --> 35:55.140
You're FaceTiming from Jeremy's car

35:55.140 --> 35:55.980
and you're only in the car with Jeremy.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.620
You're back in your bloody seat.

35:59.540 --> 36:00.380
Clark.

36:02.220 --> 36:04.020
Beck is getting the...

36:06.260 --> 36:08.540
Beck is putting the phone on,

36:08.540 --> 36:10.180
like trying to balance it on the dashboard

36:10.180 --> 36:13.180
while he rummages around for like Arby's napkins

36:13.180 --> 36:15.780
to start wiping the vomit off of him.

36:15.780 --> 36:17.500
Oh yeah, yeah.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.740
Oh, were you sick?

36:19.740 --> 36:21.180
It's not mine, Cal.

36:22.020 --> 36:24.340
I poked Julius in his gunshot wound

36:24.340 --> 36:26.180
because he didn't think it was a gunshot wound

36:26.180 --> 36:28.140
and I was trying to show him it was a gunshot wound

36:28.140 --> 36:30.180
and when I did that, he threw up on me.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.220
Checks out.

36:31.220 --> 36:32.060
Cal just...

36:32.060 --> 36:33.300
Julius says over FaceTime.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.420
Cal just kind of blinks

36:35.420 --> 36:38.020
and turns his eyes back to the road.

36:38.020 --> 36:41.300
Well, I mean, yes.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.260
It started when I was in high school

36:46.260 --> 36:49.100
and then the screen fades away.

36:49.100 --> 36:49.940
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.100
We see Julius Summers as a teenager

36:55.100 --> 36:57.780
wearing a black and white track and field uniform

36:57.780 --> 37:01.500
with the suburb sharks emblazoned on the front.

37:01.500 --> 37:04.020
We see clips of him talking and smiling with friends

37:04.020 --> 37:05.940
and teammates interspersed between highlights

37:05.940 --> 37:09.060
of his sprinting, pole vaulting, high and long jumping.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.380
Whoa, Julie, you jumped so high.

37:11.380 --> 37:13.820
It cuts to Julius on top of a podium

37:13.820 --> 37:16.860
wearing multiple gold medals and holding flowers.

37:16.860 --> 37:19.500
Julius is surrounded by his friends and fans

37:19.500 --> 37:21.980
and being showered with congratulations and praise.

37:21.980 --> 37:23.700
His thighs are so big.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.540
Eventually the crowd...

37:24.540 --> 37:26.620
That's how I jump so much.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.140
Eventually the crowd thins out as the event wraps up.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.780
The other teens head home with their parents

37:30.780 --> 37:31.900
or older siblings.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.980
And eventually Julius stands completely alone

37:33.980 --> 37:36.460
near the pickup lane at the high school.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.340
He flags down someone walking to their car

37:38.340 --> 37:40.020
and asked to use their cell phone.

37:40.020 --> 37:43.180
Julius dials a number and holds the phone up to his ear.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.860
Hey mom, are you...

37:45.860 --> 37:46.980
Oh, okay.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.540
Yeah, I won.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.780
Yeah, okay, I'll just walk home.

37:53.780 --> 37:54.700
See you tonight?

37:55.860 --> 37:57.420
Julius hands the phone back.

37:57.420 --> 37:59.620
Politely declines a ride home

37:59.620 --> 38:02.620
and begins to walk the four miles to his mom's house.

38:02.620 --> 38:03.860
About three miles down the road,

38:03.860 --> 38:05.220
Julius steps off the pavement

38:05.220 --> 38:06.980
toward an overgrown path in the woods,

38:06.980 --> 38:09.420
a shortcut he's taken a thousand times.

38:09.420 --> 38:10.940
About 50 feet onto the trail,

38:10.940 --> 38:14.860
Julius hears a twig snap and a low gravelly voice.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.300
Nice race.

38:16.340 --> 38:18.060
Julius spins around to look at a man

38:18.060 --> 38:20.180
in a tight, ratty black suit,

38:20.180 --> 38:23.060
dark aviator sunglasses and worn combat boots

38:23.060 --> 38:26.060
with thin waist-length pitch black hair

38:26.060 --> 38:27.740
leaning up against a tree.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.900
Julius's stomach jumps to his throat

38:29.900 --> 38:31.820
as he manages to squeak out.

38:31.820 --> 38:32.980
Yeah, thanks.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.820
I've been watching you.

38:35.820 --> 38:38.500
We've been watching you,

38:38.500 --> 38:39.980
rooting for you,

38:39.980 --> 38:44.300
keeping track of all your accomplishments and failures.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.820
You're good.

38:46.820 --> 38:49.100
Almost as good as some of our guys.

38:51.180 --> 38:53.100
What the fuck are you talking about?

38:54.220 --> 38:55.260
Come here.

38:55.260 --> 38:57.140
Let me get a closer look.

38:58.020 --> 38:59.660
Let me,

38:59.660 --> 39:01.260
let me feel your strength.

39:02.980 --> 39:04.340
Get the fuck away from me!

39:05.500 --> 39:08.180
Okay, damn, we're gonna have to play it this way, huh?

39:08.180 --> 39:10.860
Well, I'll give you a head start.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.340
Julius stares at the man.

39:13.380 --> 39:16.180
He notices how unevenly shaved the man's face is.

39:16.180 --> 39:17.940
A patch of three or four hairs

39:17.940 --> 39:20.140
inches longer than his five o'clock shadow

39:20.140 --> 39:22.100
protrudes from his chin.

39:22.100 --> 39:25.500
The man raises his hand up to stroke the longer hairs.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.140
Five,

39:27.140 --> 39:27.980
four,

39:28.980 --> 39:30.380
three.

39:30.380 --> 39:32.980
The man ever so slightly flicks his sunglasses down,

39:32.980 --> 39:34.420
looks over them at Julius

39:34.420 --> 39:36.980
and motions his head toward the trail.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.260
Go, Mr. Summers.

39:39.660 --> 39:42.580
Julius takes off sprinting towards safety.

39:42.660 --> 39:43.780
Two.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.180
He hurdles over fallen limbs,

39:45.180 --> 39:47.300
rusted scrap metal and loose rocks.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.860
His vision narrows as his flight response fully kicks in.

39:50.860 --> 39:51.740
One.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.580
Julius hears quick heavy footsteps

39:53.580 --> 39:55.100
begin falling behind him.

39:55.100 --> 39:56.900
He can almost see the end of the tree line

39:56.900 --> 39:59.420
that opens up into the back of his neighborhood.

39:59.420 --> 40:03.100
Looks like I'll be taking those medals today, boy.

40:03.940 --> 40:06.980
Julius falls to the ground as he's tackled from behind.

40:06.980 --> 40:09.500
His face is shoved into the mud as his legs

40:09.500 --> 40:11.340
and hands are zip tied behind him.

40:11.340 --> 40:12.660
The man flips over onto his back.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.740
Can you say that again real quick?

40:14.740 --> 40:16.140
His face is shoved into the mud.

40:16.140 --> 40:18.060
The fact was so close.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.940
Julius falls to the ground as he is tackled from behind.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.100
His face is shoved into the mud as his legs

40:23.100 --> 40:25.220
and hands are zip tied behind him.

40:25.220 --> 40:28.420
The man flips over onto his back and stands over him.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.380
We'll get you in proper shape.

40:30.380 --> 40:31.260
Trust me, bud.

40:32.420 --> 40:34.460
The screen goes dark as the man's foot comes down

40:34.460 --> 40:35.780
on Julius's face.

40:35.780 --> 40:40.780
And then, yeah, pretty much just training every day.

40:45.780 --> 40:49.260
And then they tell me to do something and I do it.

40:49.260 --> 40:51.860
Did they ever tell you who they were?

40:54.220 --> 40:56.020
As far as you guys are concerned,

40:56.020 --> 40:58.740
for now they're X-Files and I'm X-Files.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.540
Wait, these are your nerd friends?

41:01.300 --> 41:02.140
Yeah.

41:05.460 --> 41:06.940
Sure, Cal.

41:06.940 --> 41:11.940
No, wait, that, that heroine story felt very real.

41:13.460 --> 41:18.460
This is the, you're, son of a bitch, you're an X-Files.

41:18.580 --> 41:19.420
I am.

41:19.420 --> 41:24.420
There's like a look of like relief and a resolve in Beck

41:24.900 --> 41:26.980
because it's all fucking real.

41:26.980 --> 41:28.860
He fucking knew it.

41:28.860 --> 41:30.660
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

41:30.660 --> 41:32.180
Cal vomits in Beck's lap.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.300
I'm gonna need some more of those napkins.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.380
Julius looks over at Jeremy.

41:38.380 --> 41:39.940
I guess you're in now, too.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.340
Jeremy's eyes are so fucking big, dude.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.220
That's an ep.

41:47.220 --> 41:48.060
Sweet.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.140
That's fucking dope, dude.

41:49.180 --> 41:53.020
It's great and it's all my fault

41:54.980 --> 41:59.980
because my life is great

41:59.980 --> 42:01.940
and it's all mine

42:09.540 --> 42:14.500
because my life is great

42:14.500 --> 42:16.780
and it's all my fault

42:19.140 --> 42:24.140
because my life is great
