00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
Greetings, friends of all shapes and sizes, especially those that are octagonally inclined.

00:08.160 --> 00:13.200
This is Wolf from the past, hitting you in the present, so that you can have a brighter

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
future.

00:14.200 --> 00:23.440
And the future is always looking bright here on 694.2 PTBP, contentions only time travel

00:23.440 --> 00:25.560
and pirate radio show.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.800
Squares need not apply, because only the dopest geometry is invited to listen in on

00:31.800 --> 00:34.240
this week's Howlin' with Wolf.

00:34.240 --> 00:40.720
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Matt in Singapore, aka at taffysaint, who tweeted

00:40.720 --> 00:44.020
about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

00:44.020 --> 00:45.020
They write,

00:45.020 --> 00:51.000
Wolf, since the advent of digital radio and interwebs, we've been able to tap into your

00:51.000 --> 00:55.440
dulcet-toned broadcast all the way out here in Singapore.

00:55.440 --> 01:01.760
The trouble in contention sounds troubling, but I am sure what people remain are pleased

01:01.760 --> 01:05.960
that you are there to recap the tragedy on a weekly basis.

01:05.960 --> 01:12.160
I know when I am facing supernatural terrors from beyond time and space, it's useful to

01:12.160 --> 01:19.080
have someone remind me what just happened, just in case there is a tentacle or proboscis

01:19.080 --> 01:21.040
that escaped my notice.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.960
Anyway, impending apocalypse aside, I hope all is well with you.

01:25.960 --> 01:31.200
Your broadcasts have inspired me to seek a group of plucky idiots of my own out here

01:31.200 --> 01:37.840
to help, ineptly, continue the fight for all that is right in the world, or at least some

01:37.840 --> 01:39.720
unclaimed drug money.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.520
Either or is fine.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.880
Well, thanks for writin', Matt in Singapore.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.560
All is well with your number one slime puppy, Wolf the dog.

01:49.560 --> 01:55.080
I'm always gonna be here to remind y'all about all them tentacles that can creep up

01:55.080 --> 01:56.080
on ya.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.440
Y'all like hentai?

01:57.440 --> 01:59.000
I certainly might.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.760
But anyway, I'm glad to hear you are takin' up arms with a new crew out of the blue.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.440
I got a couple tips for y'all.

02:07.440 --> 02:15.120
Make sure you get eight hours of sleep, focus on work-life balance, and eat as much trash

02:15.120 --> 02:16.960
meat as you can.

02:16.960 --> 02:22.280

The sixth one comes out this week, and it's straight up some BTS action.

02:58.200 --> 03:06.280
It may be the sixth Patreon exclusive episode, but it's our session zero for this whole campaign,

03:06.280 --> 03:11.000
in which we discuss PC creation and fleshed out the town of contention.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.080
Speaking of this campaign, what also has a shitload of gas in the tank and isn't slowin'

03:16.080 --> 03:18.220
down anytime soon?

03:18.220 --> 03:21.160
It's the news.

03:21.160 --> 03:28.360
Last time, Jeremy Pettymore pacified a tied-up, bloody, muddy, naked man with teeny meat cylinders.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.520
Ash took off back down the trail to tell Buzz, the ranger from the state, they had found

03:33.520 --> 03:35.640
one of the missing persons.

03:35.680 --> 03:41.760
Ken Krinklehoff met up with Jeremy after not running into Ash on the trail, and he takes

03:41.760 --> 03:44.960
issue with Jeremy's new friend Rusty.

03:44.960 --> 03:53.200
After being spooked by Woodrow, Judy Krinklehoff, Sharon Shadow Berryman, and Liz Lonklin answered

03:53.200 --> 03:55.880
the ranger from state's questions.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.480
Judy doused her arms in hand sanitizer and is deeply worried about her mother, Krista

04:01.480 --> 04:06.240
Krinklehoff's minivan in the parking lot of the contention woods.

04:06.240 --> 04:13.760
Liz tried to, down low, too slow, Woodrow's hand sanitizer squirt and failed, while Shadow

04:13.760 --> 04:19.360
decided hand sanitizer would skewer her connection with the earth and the moon and such.

04:19.360 --> 04:25.200
The three then saw dripping of blood from the back of Woodrow's neck, staining his shirt.

04:25.200 --> 04:31.160
Ash Hornbeam got lost in the woods, saw Tree with a bright light shining from a forearm

04:31.160 --> 04:37.320
sized hollow, and avoided a hidden tripwire before sticking his arm right on in that there

04:37.320 --> 04:39.280
tree hollow.

04:39.280 --> 04:43.260
This was a pretty alarming decision.

04:43.260 --> 04:46.720
He seems to have risked his life with this one.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.520
He'll have to take on any monsters in the woods single-handedly.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.520
You hear that?

04:52.520 --> 05:00.560
That's the sound of one hand clapping for Blue False Indigo with Moon Dance.

05:01.160 --> 05:05.360
She runs.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.360
She runs.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.360
She runs.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.360
She runs.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.360
She runs.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.360
The sun.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.360
The sun.

05:18.360 --> 05:27.360
The sun is sleeping soon.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.360
She knows.

05:29.560 --> 05:44.560
She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the, dance beneath the shadow of the

05:44.560 --> 05:54.560
moon.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.560
I'm just like, uh, dude, did you know that you're bleeding out of your head?

05:57.760 --> 05:59.760
Oh, goodness gracious.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.760
I lent my first aid kit to some nice young gentleman earlier and I wish they would have

06:04.760 --> 06:05.760
left it with me.

06:05.760 --> 06:10.760
So I actually have a first aid kit in my Lamborghini.

06:10.760 --> 06:17.760
I call it my Lamborghini.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.760
I could patch you up if you let me use your machete.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.760
Oh, that is an interesting trade proposition.

06:23.960 --> 06:29.960
I will give you a roll of persuasion with a plus 40 since you're trading such an enticing

06:29.960 --> 06:33.960
offer.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
25 on a 60.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.960
Congratulations for passing.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.960
I will absolutely take you up on that offer.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.960
So he grabs the machete off the back wall and he hands it to you.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.960
Now, I'm really hoping that you never use this.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.960
I'll use it if I want to use it, but thank you.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.160
If there's any brush in your way, it's likely to be mint there.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.160
All right.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
Yeah.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
I'm going to file that away.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.160
Okay.

06:58.160 --> 07:12.160
So I go grab my first aid kit from my Lamborghini and I also grab one extra vial for his blood.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.160
Interesting.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.160
All right.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.160
So as you patch him up, are you taking a sample of this blood?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.160
He can't tell though.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.160
It's on the back of his neck.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.160
All right.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.360
I'm going to do it for me.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.360
10%.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
All right.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.360
A three.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
Wow.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.360
That's dope.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.360
Means good.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.360
Yeah.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.360
Dope means good, Allie.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.360
Unless it's drugs, which are also good.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.360
Just kidding.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.360
Don't you judge?

07:31.360 --> 07:32.360
Yeah.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.360
We're an anti-drug podcast.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.360
Everybody knows that.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
For all the 13 year olds and below.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.360
Also the ones about drugs.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.360
The ones about drugs.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.360
I'm just kidding.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
I'm just kidding.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
I'm just kidding.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
I'm just kidding.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.360
I'm just kidding.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.360
I'm just kidding.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.360
I'm just kidding.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
I'm just kidding.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
I'm just kidding.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.360
I'm just kidding.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
I'm just kidding.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
We're also the ones above 13.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
Yeah.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.560
I was going to say, I think our main listener group is like 45-ish.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.560
Don't do drugs, dads.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.560
If you're 14, you're in.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.560
If you're 14, you're in.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
Yeah.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.560
Dads, wait till your kids are 14 until you start doing drugs again.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.560
Taylor's coughing like so much.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.560
It's like she's trying to sabotage us.

08:08.560 --> 08:12.560
I'm just like trying to make this about me.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.560
All righty.

08:14.760 --> 08:21.760
So, with all of that taken care of, what are you bringing with you into the woods?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.560
Did you bring any camping gear?

08:23.560 --> 08:27.160
Were you planning on spending the night or are you just out here to do this and then

08:27.160 --> 08:28.160
go back home?

08:28.160 --> 08:29.160
We have some blankets.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.360
I was told that this was a sleepover at Shadow's, so I just have my footie pajamas and my sleeping

08:34.360 --> 08:35.360
bag.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
I have no other thing.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
And my toothbrush, obviously.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Obviously.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.560
I have a lighter, obviously, and cigarettes, and a pocket knife.

08:41.560 --> 08:42.560
Naturally.

08:42.560 --> 08:43.560
Notch.

08:43.960 --> 08:54.660
I have some crystals and a first aid kit, and I would definitely have other helpful

08:54.660 --> 08:55.960
and useful items.

08:55.960 --> 09:00.160
Well, you would certainly have the left pinky of a deceased squirrel.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.160
Correct.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.160
A...

09:02.160 --> 09:03.160
A vial of my own blood.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.160
Correct.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.160
A vial of Woodrow's blood.

09:08.160 --> 09:15.460
A bucket full of the soil from underneath a calf that was menstruating.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.460
That's correct.

09:16.460 --> 09:17.460
And...

09:17.460 --> 09:18.460
Some bird poop.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.460
Peat.

09:19.460 --> 09:20.460
Yes.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.460
Some strained out bird urine.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.960
Did we use a sieve?

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
Yeah.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
100%.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
Yes.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.360
Is Judy into gold digging?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.360
Is that what a sieve is?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.360
I don't know what a sieve is.

09:30.360 --> 09:35.360
A sieve is not for gold digging.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
Okay.

09:37.360 --> 09:41.360
And I'll leave it at that.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.360
Okay, so sifter...

09:42.360 --> 09:43.960
Alright, let's get you guys into the woods.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.660
You take everything that you brought with you into the woods, and you head down to a

09:47.660 --> 09:50.360
designated camping spot.

09:50.360 --> 09:56.460
The camp spots in the Woods of Contention traditionally have wood and a fire pit built

09:56.460 --> 10:01.660
up and ready to go for each individual spot to make it easy for anyone who's spending

10:01.660 --> 10:04.360
time there to immediately start a fire.

10:04.360 --> 10:10.160
However, when you get to yours, you see that there are no rocks surrounding your fire

10:10.160 --> 10:11.160
pit.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.160
There's plenty of wood.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.260
However, no rocks to speak of.

10:14.260 --> 10:19.560
So if you were to start a fire, you think it might catch the woods on fire.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.560
All of them.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.760
Judy's very concerned about that.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.060
I'm just going to start looking around for some bigger rocks to see if I can make some

10:26.060 --> 10:27.060
kind of barrier.

10:27.060 --> 10:33.260
Well, I just normally want to understand the soil below me because I don't really feel

10:33.260 --> 10:39.060
like I can be a part of our ritual unless we're all in this together, meaning the earth

10:39.060 --> 10:42.060
and the trees and the sky and the moon.

10:42.060 --> 10:52.060
So I'm doing a little bit of swaying in the wind.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.460
And Judy, what is Judy doing?

10:53.460 --> 10:55.060
Just staring at where rocks were?

10:55.060 --> 11:00.660
Yeah, Judy's just desperately looking for something to cling to as far as emotion.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.960
She's really terrified already.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.960
She's coming to grips with the fact that she's going to be out in the dark.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.960
And Liz is already left to go look for rocks.

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
Yeah, Liz is gone.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.360
So yeah, Judy's just standing around looking for comfort.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.360
And I keep being like, Judy, sway with me.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.360
Shadow?

11:16.360 --> 11:20.360
Maybe we should just find a nice place to brush our teeth?

11:20.360 --> 11:23.160
Maybe in a pond somewhere that is nice?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.360
You're going to brush your teeth with pond water?

11:25.360 --> 11:26.360
Oh, you're right.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
Why would I do that?

11:27.360 --> 11:28.360
That's so stupid.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.760
Maybe we should go look for your mom, Judy.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.160
Okay, Shadow, I really need you to stop saying that because you know how nervous that makes

11:37.160 --> 11:38.960
me think that my mom is out here.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.660
Someone definitely stole her car like Elizabeth said.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.360
From like forever away, I'm like, Judy, your mom's fine.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.360
Yeah, you're right.

11:46.360 --> 11:48.360
Anything you say is right and always.

11:58.360 --> 12:11.960
Lindsay, Liz is walking up out of your little camping spot and looking for these big rocks.

12:11.960 --> 12:17.260
So first, I am going to request a sanity roll.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.260
First one.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.260
That means something's coming.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.400
You've played D&D before.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.360
You ain't rolled a sanity check.

12:22.360 --> 12:23.360
Oh, fuck.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.360
What'd you roll?

12:24.360 --> 12:27.360
If I roll a double zero and eight, that's 100.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.360
That's a pass.

12:28.360 --> 12:29.360
All right, all right, all right.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.360
So you rolled an eight.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.360
I rolled an eight.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.360
Yes.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.960
Under your sanity, which your sanity is?

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
My sanity is 50.

12:35.960 --> 12:42.660
Okay, so you're going to change your current sanity to 49 because you lose one sanity as

12:42.660 --> 12:47.820
the world around you begins to kind of warp and change.

12:47.820 --> 12:52.580
You were just looking through these woods for rocks and you could not find any and then

12:52.580 --> 12:56.760
all of a sudden you are seemingly standing in a different spot in the woods.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.760
All right.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.760
Roll a surge for me.

13:01.760 --> 13:02.760
21.

13:02.760 --> 13:03.760
On?

13:03.760 --> 13:04.760
On.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.760
A 50.

13:05.760 --> 13:06.760
Oh, congratulations.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.760
All right, thank you.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.480
So you're going to find a couple of things.

13:10.480 --> 13:17.100
So you turn back and you don't recognize the path that you just took to walk out here,

13:17.100 --> 13:23.240
but looking forward, you do see a few rocks, big rocks, and next to them, even bigger rocks.

13:23.240 --> 13:30.640
And these bigger rocks have a cleavage that you can see right over.

13:30.640 --> 13:41.820
And you see there's an extremely fit man in his mid 40s and he is bald and he has a super

13:41.820 --> 13:50.280
cut jaw line, like a big jaw line with some one day scruff, single day scruff.

13:50.320 --> 13:56.960
And he is walking around in circles with his hands just like waving all about and he seems

13:56.960 --> 13:59.280
to be like talking to himself.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.080
Judy Krinklehoff.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.360
Hello.

14:17.360 --> 14:23.800
You are standing near Shadow who is swaying and staring up at the moon and digging her

14:23.800 --> 14:30.800
toes into the dirt beneath trying to become a moon baby.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
A maybe.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
A maybe.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.800
Is what it's called.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.800
If you won't.

14:34.800 --> 14:41.160
And as that happens, I need you to roll a sanity check at a negative 40.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.160
What is your sanity?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.720
My sanity is at a 40.

14:43.720 --> 14:44.720
Oh, right.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.960
So if you roll a zero zero one, that would be a success.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.640
But if your dice match, then it'll be a critical failure.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.400
Sounds great.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.400
I rolled a 98.

14:54.400 --> 14:59.000
Oh my God, that's incredible.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.120
So that's terrible.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.120
And you failed miserably.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.120
Cool.

15:02.120 --> 15:06.680
I'm going to need you to roll a D six, which is the normal die in order to see how much

15:06.680 --> 15:08.280
sanity you lose.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.280
Okay.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.640
I roll a five.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
Okay.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.760
You're going to go batshit crazy.

15:14.760 --> 15:21.280
So when you lose five or more sanity in one go, you automatically will have a bout of

15:21.280 --> 15:24.960
insanity is how we're going to play it for this little story.

15:24.960 --> 15:30.040
That means that you will either have a faint, flight, or flight.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.480
Did I say flight twice?

15:31.480 --> 15:32.480
Who knows?

15:32.480 --> 15:36.320
Flight, fight, or faint are the three options for your character.

15:36.320 --> 15:41.160
So let's rank them in most to least likely for Judy.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.960
So what would be the most likely thing for Judy to do in this situation?

15:44.960 --> 15:45.960
Judy would faint.

15:45.960 --> 15:46.960
Faint.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.840
So if you roll a one, two, or three on the D six, then Judy will faint.

15:49.840 --> 15:53.240
And what would be the second most likely flight that makes sense.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.120
So if you roll four or five, she'll run away.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.280
And then if you roll a six, she will get extremely aggressive.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.280
Okay.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
Sounds great.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.520
Go ahead and roll that D six.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.840
I got a five.

16:04.840 --> 16:10.920
So Judy is going to freak out and take off running, but you look over and you see shadow

16:11.320 --> 16:18.160
swaying and her swaying begins to become one with the trees behind her and the trees are

16:18.160 --> 16:25.520
swaying and then the ground starts moving from underneath you and you lose touch with

16:25.520 --> 16:31.920
your own sense of direction and the sky above you turns into the ground and everything is

16:31.920 --> 16:37.440
upside down and the ground underneath you is above you in the sky and your feet are

16:37.440 --> 16:45.760
on top of your head playing patty cake with your hands and you cannot tell what is reality

16:45.760 --> 16:49.320
and you need to get away from this place.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.320
So won't Taylor come back in?

17:07.440 --> 17:13.560
Hey Taylor, Hey.

17:13.560 --> 17:21.920
So shadow is swaying in the wind and trying to become a maybe a maybe a moon baby.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.920
Yeah.

17:22.920 --> 17:23.920
Mm hmm.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
Yeah.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
That's a term I made up and I knew it already.

17:25.920 --> 17:26.920
Yep.

17:26.920 --> 17:27.920
Yep.

17:27.920 --> 17:28.920
Everyone knew it.

17:28.920 --> 17:29.920
Duh.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.880
You look over and you see Judy and Judy doesn't look like Judy.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.880
Like her normal.

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
Judy.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
Hey Judy.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.880
Hi.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.880
How are you doing?

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
Don't talk to me.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
You look like a tree.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.360
How long have you been a tree?

17:41.360 --> 17:47.240
I mean in spirit I've always seen myself more like a pebble but like a tree is strong and

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
powerful too.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.240
So I'll take it.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.240
Stop talking to me.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.240
Oh my God.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.240
I can't do this anymore.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.240
I have to go right now.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.240
Oh my God.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.240
I have to run to safety.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
Wait.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.240
Where is safety?

17:57.240 --> 17:58.240
I don't know.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.240
Just don't talk to me.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.240
You're a freaking tree.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
And then Judy runs off into the woods.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.720
I sigh heavily.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.480
I say pardon me moon.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.480
Just give me a minute.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.280
I grab the machete and I run after her.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.000
I should also add that Judy has put on her footie pajamas at this point.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.280
Oh of course.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.160
So she's wearing those as she's running off.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.040
Does she have her toothbrush in her hand?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.040
Oh it's in her pocket.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.040
In her hand.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
Oh and cute.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.040
It's a zip up pocket so it'll stay in no matter what.

18:32.720 --> 18:40.240
Shadow.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.260
You were talking to Judy and she called you a tree.

18:44.260 --> 18:46.120
If you were a tree what kind of tree would you be?

18:46.120 --> 18:50.480
I would be a strong cherry oak elm.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.480
Wow.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.980
And suicide.

18:53.980 --> 18:54.980
Tree form.

18:54.980 --> 18:55.980
All mixed together.

18:55.980 --> 18:59.160
For those of you who don't know.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.160
What do you do when Judy just takes off running?

19:01.160 --> 19:04.520
I'm used to Judy being a little bit erratic.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.260
I'm also up for a little bit of adventure in the night.

19:08.260 --> 19:13.120
I just sort of assume that like the forest will take us where it wants to take us.

19:13.120 --> 19:17.960
And so I follow suit to find our destiny.

19:17.960 --> 19:23.240
Oh okay so are you going to follow her in the same direction at the same clip or are

19:23.240 --> 19:24.380
you just walking?

19:24.380 --> 19:25.800
How are you doing about this?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.800
I would say it's somewhere in between.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.760
I'm definitely not walking.

19:30.760 --> 19:35.160
I'm kind of I'm like leaping through the forest.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.200
I love it.

19:36.200 --> 19:41.360
And I have like these attached veils they attach to my thumb and they're almost like

19:41.360 --> 19:44.440
these wings but just of like meshy material.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.440
What?

19:45.440 --> 19:51.120
So when I leap through it's almost like I'm a dancer but they kind of like float like

19:51.120 --> 20:07.560
little ribbons out.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
Lindsay.

20:08.560 --> 20:09.560
Yes.

20:09.560 --> 20:14.880
Liz is standing at a bit of a clearing here and she's looking at these big rocks and in

20:14.880 --> 20:21.600
between a nice cleavage of rocks you have seen this man who is waving his arms about

20:21.600 --> 20:29.680
and talking to himself and he is bald and has some scruff and a big jawline seems to

20:29.680 --> 20:36.800
be in his mid-40s and I need you to roll an alertness check for me.

20:36.800 --> 20:41.400
49 on a 50.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.360
Congratulations.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.640
So you're gonna see a couple things.

20:45.640 --> 20:51.480
The first thing you are going to see is that the trees directly in the area that seemed

20:51.480 --> 20:59.720
to be making a circle around this clearing all have a very specific sigil carved into

20:59.720 --> 21:00.720
them.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.760
It is like a single line with three lines coming off the top and two lines coming off

21:05.760 --> 21:11.600
the bottom and it looks like kind of a like a branch of some sort and you would also notice

21:11.600 --> 21:18.400
inside the clearing where this man is he is surrounded in a circle of a white substance.

21:18.400 --> 21:22.840
Are we talking like coke or like liquid white?

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
Not liquid.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.840
All right.

21:24.840 --> 21:35.080
I know we were both thinking milk but it is a powder of some sort so that is what you

21:35.080 --> 21:36.080
see.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.520
What action would you like to take here?

21:37.520 --> 21:41.200
I think as Liz, okay Liz.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.200
You do think as Liz.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.800
I think as Liz, yeah that's not how I'm thinking.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.360
I think I'm gonna try and get the fuck out of there I don't think I'm gonna want to mess

21:50.360 --> 21:51.360
with any of it.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.320
Okay then let's roll a check against each other real quick you're gonna roll stealth

21:55.320 --> 22:01.080
I'm gonna roll his alertness and we'll see if he sees you.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.000
Okay all right I'm ready I'm rolling for stealth.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
That is correct.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.200
85 on a 50.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.120
That is a fail.

22:10.120 --> 22:17.360
That is a fail and so you are staring at him and then you take a step backward and just

22:17.360 --> 22:21.720
crunch down on a big old stick, crack!

22:21.720 --> 22:26.200
And it echoes throughout this little clearing that he's in and he immediately looks over

22:26.200 --> 22:32.920
makes direct eye contact with you and he's waving you forward and he wants you to he

22:32.920 --> 22:36.800
wants you to join him and he's like oh you gotta get around from over there you know

22:36.800 --> 22:43.520
you gotta use a bit of my shiver in the woods you know it's not gonna find you if you didn't.

22:43.520 --> 22:49.160
All right Liz finds this guy attractive so I mean he's talking to me now I'm gonna go

22:49.160 --> 22:56.240
towards him okay okay probably mistake you are approaching the white powdery line and

22:56.240 --> 23:01.920
he's like oh hey if we're gonna stop before you touch on it if you don't you step right

23:01.920 --> 23:06.640
over it instead of messing but all right she steps over it and walks over to him and he

23:06.640 --> 23:11.760
immediately like runs up to you and is and is like what are you doing out here if it's

23:11.760 --> 23:15.040
not a problem in the night it's the sky's about to turn.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.400
What the fuck are you doing out here also where are you from?

23:17.400 --> 23:21.260
I you know across the sea came over for a bit of business but a lot of shit's happened

23:21.260 --> 23:26.160
since then you gotta keep safe gotta keep safe there's nothing about the fish out here

23:26.160 --> 23:30.640
so we gotta find it if it's not here then she can't find us and and if she can't find

23:30.640 --> 23:31.640
us then it's safe so.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.560
Who is she what are you talking about?

23:33.560 --> 23:34.560
The lady in the wood.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.560
Oh fuck.

23:35.560 --> 23:40.920
Oh fuck is right oh fuck is damn right if you can't come around here yeah I've set up

23:40.920 --> 23:45.560
a bit of a perimeter so if you stay here with me you're gonna be safe but if you leave it's

23:45.560 --> 23:46.860
over.

23:46.860 --> 23:53.100
And he walks back towards his campsite and you see on the back of his neck he has a tattoo

23:53.100 --> 23:59.720
and it is like a stylized H so the two sides are kind of like curved in so it'd be like

23:59.720 --> 24:04.960
a backwards C and then a normal C with a line going through the middle of them.

24:05.440 --> 24:11.240
He doesn't have much with him he's set up like a little camp but he doesn't even have

24:11.240 --> 24:12.720
like a bag with him.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.960
Is his camp like within the circle of this white powder?

24:14.960 --> 24:20.840
Yes and the circle of white powder is probably 50 feet diameter 25 feet radius.

24:20.840 --> 24:25.880
Can I can I ask you do I trust this person?

24:25.880 --> 24:27.520
Go ahead and roll humant.

24:27.520 --> 24:37.200
I got a 41 on a oh shit.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.680
That's a fail I bet.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.800
Yeah I mean it's marked out so.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
So how do you feel about it?

24:41.800 --> 24:43.200
Wait wait wait wait on a 30.

24:43.200 --> 24:48.160
On a 30 so that is a fail yes and how do you personally Lindsay outside of the game feel

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
about this character?

24:49.160 --> 24:55.200
I'm feeling kind of sketchy I mean I just walked away from people that I've known and

24:55.200 --> 25:01.040
there's a strange man he's attractive so there's like 10% 10% wanting I want to trust

25:01.040 --> 25:02.040
him.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.040
Sure.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.040
Yeah but I don't.

25:04.040 --> 25:07.680
Attractive people do have it easier in life just in general true it is a privilege especially

25:07.680 --> 25:13.600
for people like Liz I wake up every day and I'm just like oh thank you so much lord and

25:13.600 --> 25:21.040
savior same yeah so you you feel however you want to feel about him and he's like oh you

25:21.040 --> 25:26.240
have to stay here it's nightfall at this point and if you leave you'd absolutely get

25:26.240 --> 25:31.520
in thought so there's there's no way around here you know it's got to be with the fishes

25:31.520 --> 25:37.600
and we've got to keep it left right upside down sideways I mean your feet might be where

25:37.600 --> 25:44.200
my head is but we can't see it anywhere and there's accent changes all right so what if

25:44.200 --> 25:49.200
I try can I just try and run back in the direction that I came yeah absolutely I'm gonna try

25:49.200 --> 25:50.520
and do that what do I roll for?

25:50.520 --> 25:55.560
You don't have to roll anything he's gonna call after you and he's just like oh no no

25:55.560 --> 26:01.280
you got oh god damn you gotta fucking get got there's not a chance that you're not gonna

26:01.280 --> 26:12.680
get got okay cool but I'm out of there right yeah you're out there now what roll a survival

26:12.680 --> 26:25.480
check to see if you can make it back to your campsite 91 on a 40 hell yeah hell yeah dude

26:25.480 --> 26:31.400
all right am I out now yeah you lost you're done uh bye dead yeah okay bye you're dead

26:31.400 --> 26:37.440
you're not dead you're still alive you're just lost okay as Liz Lonklin is walking through

26:37.440 --> 26:45.560
the woods desperately trying to find her campsite she loses track of where she is and the sun

26:45.560 --> 26:54.940
is starting to go down you see through the trees this brightly colored vest almost cheetah

26:54.940 --> 27:01.840
print but more of a cheetah print houndstooth mix what the hell and uh Luke if you want

27:01.840 --> 27:08.120
to describe the predicament Ash is currently in Ash currently has his arm almost up to

27:08.120 --> 27:14.640
his elbow in a tree and you can see around kind of shining out of the tree of very bright

27:14.640 --> 27:22.160
light you can also as you get closer about an inch of my skin below my elbow is completely

27:22.160 --> 27:26.920
ripped off down to the hand no like my whole hand is in the tree but about this much of

27:26.920 --> 27:35.080
it is is ripped off okay like just muscle and fat fibrous blood you guys remember that scene in

27:35.080 --> 27:41.600
127 hours when James Franco like cuts his nerve didn't watch it yeah that was hard to watch shits

27:41.600 --> 27:47.400
fucking nuts dude one thing about that is if he was a true actor he would have actually cut his

27:47.400 --> 27:53.120
arm oh you didn't hear about that yeah really he did so the whole thing off it's prosthetic now

27:53.320 --> 28:00.360
just like everyone in Hollywood's teeth are fake right he has a fake arm cool so Liz that's what

28:00.360 --> 28:06.960
you see as you approach you can also see Ash has tears streaming down his face from pain but you

28:06.960 --> 28:12.880
he's not outwardly panicked but inside he definitely is Ash hornbeam I'm like startled

28:12.880 --> 28:19.840
and I'm like oh hey Liz what are you doing out here me and the guys are well we're on a

28:19.960 --> 28:25.520
camping trip but I kind of got lost I don't something really weird happened I don't know

28:25.520 --> 28:32.640
where the hell I am and my arm is stuck in this tree yeah what's wrong with your arm what happened

28:32.640 --> 28:38.440
to you I don't know if I can pull it out anymore because it feels like there are razor blades on my

28:38.440 --> 28:44.600
arm in here and I was lost and I saw this tree and there's a hole in it with light coming out

28:44.600 --> 28:53.000
and I I just stuck my arm in it and now it's stuck and it hurts really bad and I don't I drop

28:53.000 --> 28:58.440
my axe back at the campsite so I don't really have anything to get out of here with do you have any

28:58.440 --> 29:02.240
idea how you could help me I don't do I have any weapons or anything I don't have anything on me

29:02.240 --> 29:07.720
I don't think you brought anything yeah I mean I would say go back to the campsite but I don't

29:07.720 --> 29:12.240
know where that is yeah I'm also lost I don't know I just came from a place with some crazy

29:12.360 --> 29:17.000
bald man surrounded in coke the reason that I got lost I was going back to the shack because there

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
was a crazy naked man that was all cut up and we tied him up and he also couldn't talk and he tried

29:23.000 --> 29:27.280
to eat our food and he sounded like an animal what the fuck is going on out here I don't know

29:27.280 --> 29:33.360
but my main priority right now is to get out of this fucking tree and I pull my arm about half an

29:33.360 --> 29:41.840
inch out a little more lose another hit point and you feel your skin rip off the first three layers

29:41.960 --> 29:49.080
of your skin are completely gone and blood begins running down your elbow and dripping onto the

29:49.080 --> 29:57.400
ground and as you look down you see that the grass where it's dripping is dead can I like look around

29:57.400 --> 30:04.160
and try oh by the way watch out for that trip wire there is there it is that's what I was about to

30:04.160 --> 30:12.280
implement if you say that in time then I won't have her hit it so he calls out about a trip wire

30:12.280 --> 30:19.000
and looking down right where you were about to step mm-hmm there is a wire that is running across

30:19.000 --> 30:28.120
from a tree to a post in the ground I feel helpless that is part of the game yep can I go ahead and

30:28.120 --> 30:32.000
roll a sanity check for me both of you because you do not know how to get out of the situation

30:32.400 --> 30:39.280
and helpless is the exact word that I could use to describe this sanity check I got a 93 that is a

30:39.280 --> 30:47.240
failure 34 on 44 so you're good so you're gonna keep a level head because your arms not trapped

30:47.240 --> 30:52.640
in this tree yeah and you're starting to realize that yeah you might have to be the one to leave

30:52.640 --> 30:59.840
and call for help Luke you are going to lose a single sanity putting your sanity down to 37 and

30:59.840 --> 31:07.680
ash starts to freak out a little more and Liz can tell that I am very panicked I you freak out

31:07.680 --> 31:15.080
enough to wear a little fun rule about this game is that when you lose sanity the handler can make

31:15.080 --> 31:20.720
an action for you awesome so it'll be helpful and my arm will be out of here after that when you

31:20.720 --> 31:28.280
lose that sanity you freak out enough to rip at your arm and try to pull it out without bracing

31:28.280 --> 31:37.040
yourself and you pull your arm out another like three inches and you lose three hit points putting

31:37.040 --> 31:44.840
your hit points at two Luke ash hornbeam needs to roll a constitution check in order to stay

31:44.840 --> 31:56.240
conscious here 29 on a 45 oh you are allowed to keep your head however you are not allowed to keep

31:56.240 --> 32:02.440
your cool I throw up yeah out of pain and panic calm down please stop pulling your arm out of the

32:02.440 --> 32:09.800
tree hang on hang on just a second hang on just stay still and then I'm gonna be like help

32:12.360 --> 32:20.600
anyone around you laugh maniacally after yeah I'm a bitch remember now that my arm is probably

32:20.600 --> 32:31.720
there's more room around it right yet it is still just as as well as early pinched I really I don't

32:31.720 --> 32:36.320
have any idea what to do right now okay I'm just gonna I'm just gonna like start looking for help

32:36.320 --> 32:40.720
help help I start like running away I'm looking for somebody I'm gonna leave them cuz I can't do

32:40.720 --> 32:47.000
anything yeah I like I've almost forgot that she's even here cuz I'm just looking at six inches of

32:47.000 --> 32:53.840
my arm completely shed of skin oh what is that that's that's a nerve you can see it uh-huh it's

32:53.840 --> 32:59.720
like just like in 127 hours it's like 127 hours yeah so I'm just standing here just staring at

32:59.720 --> 33:04.800
it like in shock like look off I've started to say something to Liz but she's gone I'm out

33:18.000 --> 33:26.160
Judy Krinkelhoff is running sprinting through the woods trees are lashing her body but she's paying

33:26.160 --> 33:33.080
it no mind as the world around her is melting and contorting and convulsing all at the same time the

33:33.080 --> 33:39.440
earth seems to be pulsating but the ground is the sky and you have no idea what's going on so I'm

33:39.440 --> 33:45.640
gonna have you roll either which is higher your survival or your alertness my alertness is higher

33:45.640 --> 33:52.040
and what is your alertness I have a 70 so you are going to be rolling at a negative 40 so you

33:52.040 --> 33:57.880
need to roll a 30 or under in order to pass this alertness check go and roll those dice for me I

33:57.880 --> 34:08.520
got an 11 that is a critical success and the world immediately all at once becomes normal to you as

34:08.520 --> 34:16.600
you stop dead in your tracks because right in front of you is very clearly a pile of leaves

34:16.600 --> 34:23.800
that is wholly suspicious as if beneath it lies some sort of trap but Judy notices this and stops

34:23.800 --> 34:34.480
just before falling prey to this sham leaf pile however Judy is not alone in these woods Sharon

34:34.480 --> 34:43.280
shadow Berryman as you are sashaying through the woods chasing after your dear friend Judy

34:43.280 --> 34:53.560
crinklehoff I need you to roll an alertness check for me what's your alertness 40 okay I got a 61

34:53.560 --> 35:02.640
all right so you do not see Judy teetering on the edge of destruction as you nonchalantly dance

35:02.800 --> 35:08.520
burst onto the scene Ally I want you to roll dexterity and because you crit earlier there's

35:08.520 --> 35:13.880
no chance you'll fall into the leaves so you're just rolling to grab shadow and throw her off her

35:13.880 --> 35:27.960
path okay I got a 15 whoa so you I already had plans but so shadows like barreling toward you

35:28.000 --> 35:35.880
in a very whimsical manner and you see her just in time to grab her and pull her to the edge and

35:35.880 --> 35:41.400
the two of you fall and hit the ground and as you do that one of your arms flings out and hits this

35:41.400 --> 35:49.400
pile of leaves and immediately the entire pile falls and you look down and you see that there

35:49.400 --> 36:09.560
is a 10-foot drop into a pit below Judy oh my god you saved my life I just sort of thought that

36:09.560 --> 36:18.360
maybe fate could take us together down that hole um shadow I am really trying to lose trust in you

36:18.360 --> 36:24.040
right now because first you turn into a tree and then you chase me through the trees and try to

36:24.040 --> 36:31.880
push me let's talk about that Judy like why am I no no I can't do this right now because I feel

36:31.880 --> 36:38.680
like my mind is down that hole right now and I'm just up here without my mind right now do you want

36:38.680 --> 36:48.160
to do some breathing exercises with my crystals okay let's go back to the camp and maybe on the

36:48.160 --> 36:53.800
way we can pick some flowers and put them in your hair and you'll feel a little better would that

36:53.800 --> 37:04.120
make you feel better Judy it would not who has a better survival check I have 50 I also have 50

37:04.120 --> 37:14.240
okay then who wants to roll some dice I really wanted to find a way in this game to use my bird

37:14.240 --> 37:19.240
calling sure so I thought maybe now would be a good time I could be like and then the birds

37:19.240 --> 37:29.480
would lead us to the camp interesting and how might that work well I would go and they would

37:29.480 --> 37:35.360
swoop down and like slowly flap their wings as we danced behind them shadow like knew which

37:35.360 --> 37:41.920
birds were like closest to her campsite earlier so you could listen for those bird sounds as

37:41.920 --> 37:46.840
opposed to earlier one well okay when I think of bird calling I think of like bird communicating

37:46.840 --> 37:52.480
like it's a back-and-forth sure because I'm in that forest all the time 100 and so I have like

37:52.480 --> 37:59.840
five bird friends so I would like to use my bird calling and my very accurate and reasonable

37:59.840 --> 38:09.360
explanation is that I noticed that there were a line of oak trees right by our campsite and I

38:09.360 --> 38:18.200
happen to know that there is a regional canary by the name of Churchill that's its bird species

38:18.200 --> 38:27.600
of course yeah and it only nests in oak trees of that age and so I'm listening and right now it's

38:27.600 --> 38:37.840
pretty faint but it's coming from the West so we're gonna head west three that's a good rule

38:38.680 --> 38:46.400
listening for the sounds of the what was it church an airy yeah the bird which is in the

38:46.400 --> 38:56.000
Oaks of a certain age you make your way back and you find your campsite however you do not find a

38:56.000 --> 39:06.000
Liz waiting for you at said campsite but what you do notice is a raccoon a raccoon a raccoon that is

39:06.000 --> 39:12.520
sitting on a log that is around the fire like a person might just like cross-legged and it is

39:12.520 --> 39:18.320
using its tiny little fingers to eat food any food that you guys might have brought with you

39:18.320 --> 39:24.920
it is chowing down on look at that little trash panda oh my god he's so cute I love him so much

39:24.920 --> 39:39.440
Oh shadow what is that trash panda that you said um he our good friend really pretty friend Liz

39:39.440 --> 39:49.920
what I mean I really love the idea that maybe Liz died and reincarnated very quickly into this

39:49.920 --> 39:57.160
little raccoon maybe we should ask it some questions as you guys approach it you see this

39:57.160 --> 40:03.800
raccoon it makes eye contact with you and it immediately perks up puts the food down looks

40:03.800 --> 40:09.680
at you and then runs over to your bag and starts like throwing shit out of your bags and it's

40:09.680 --> 40:16.840
clearly like looking for something I'm gonna watch it because I'm curious to see what it wants oh

40:16.840 --> 40:22.400
wait is that the bag that has our potion in it yes whose bag is it who would have brought the most

40:22.400 --> 40:28.840
food shadow I feel like shadow did yeah so then it's also the bag with the ingredients for the

40:28.840 --> 40:36.400
ritual okay well I still want to kill Brittany just for my own curiosity yeah absolutely so I'm

40:36.400 --> 40:40.640
gonna take off my jacket and I'm gonna walk over there and I'm gonna try to like jump on it and

40:40.640 --> 40:47.200
like hold it down with my jacket oh hey what are you doing Judy Judy is pretty fucking anxious

40:47.200 --> 40:52.680
right now so she has taken her arms put them inside the sleeves of her onesie that she's

40:52.680 --> 40:58.280
wearing in the head crouched down and is just sitting there rocking back and forth saying Liz's

40:58.280 --> 41:12.440
name over and over again and shadow I need you to roll an unarmed combat for me I fail and the

41:12.440 --> 41:19.200
raccoon succeeds as you attempt to throw your jacket over on top of it it dodges nimbly out

41:19.200 --> 41:26.600
of the way and it is holding a bottle of hand sanitizer that I believe Judy brought with her

41:27.080 --> 41:34.000
you guys grabbed the hand sanitizer from yeah and the raccoon is holding it and it points at the

41:34.000 --> 41:42.080
hand sanitizer and then it like does a thumb underneath its chin and swipes across like cut

41:42.080 --> 41:48.240
throat and then it like throws the hand sanitizer on the ground and backs away from it and puts its

41:48.240 --> 41:54.280
hands up and then falls over backwards like it's playing dead Judy didn't you use that hand

41:54.280 --> 42:04.240
sanitizer maybe half the bottle on my body but I didn't eat it or anything so I probably am fine

42:04.240 --> 42:12.600
or am I gonna die maybe we should use the water canteen and you should take off all your clothes

42:12.600 --> 42:19.840
and we can pour the water all over you um shadow I really want to stay in my onesie right now I feel

42:19.840 --> 42:26.960
really scared uh maybe we can just wash my hands really good when you say that the raccoon gives

42:26.960 --> 42:33.920
you a thumbs up and then motions back down the trail toward the trailhead with its thumb go

42:33.920 --> 42:43.640
ahead and roll sanity both of you is that a fail or success it's a success Oh congratulations I

42:43.640 --> 42:51.600
got a 63 on the 35 so you Judy are gonna lose one sanity taking you down to 34 dang you have such low

42:51.600 --> 43:00.320
sanity thank you for pointing that out I have 75 listen I'm insane so nothing messes with shadow

43:00.320 --> 43:08.040
everything is already messed up in her head and like I'm mighty fine with that absolutely and so

43:08.040 --> 43:15.040
Judy you were looking at this raccoon and you do not see a raccoon Taylor go ahead and take your

43:15.040 --> 43:21.880
headphones off and plug your ears for me and just wiggle your fingers around in your ears don't get

43:21.880 --> 43:29.920
in fact she's already not listening so Ally Judy sees this raccoon and looking in its eyes you see

43:29.920 --> 43:37.760
a human soul okay I just see like looking at its motions and his activities you're like that's a

43:38.000 --> 43:44.040
person I don't know why that I'm seeing it as a raccoon but that's a person okay all right Taylor

43:44.040 --> 43:50.840
and the raccoon is like actively pointing down the trail and is staring at both of you and then

43:50.840 --> 44:00.440
starts like using both thumbs in a like let's get out of here kind of motion please go with the

44:00.440 --> 44:07.600
raccoon please I think we should really trust him he seems like a trustworthy animal but as an

44:07.640 --> 44:15.480
animal and that I could trust Judy I know you've really been through a lot and I'm just not sure I

44:15.480 --> 44:22.960
can trust your judgment right now but lucky for you I really like that little raccoon because he

44:22.960 --> 44:32.040
reminds me of my mother or so let's go I like jump up I'm still like cradling my own body at

44:32.040 --> 44:36.960
this point but I jump up and I'd start following the raccoon well I'm pretending to be the raccoon

44:37.000 --> 44:42.800
as well so I'm kind of like I'm walking on my hearing legs but I kind of keep like little T

44:42.800 --> 44:48.200
Rex arms yeah I'm kind of waddling a little yeah just exactly like the raccoon is doing that's

44:48.200 --> 45:12.200
correct Liz lonklin you're walking through the forest through the trees trying to get back to

45:12.200 --> 45:21.920
the trail and you come to a spot where you can hear some people talking and as you're walking up

45:21.920 --> 45:32.000
you hear a couple voices and then you see hey what are you guys doing right now you're are you still

45:32.000 --> 45:44.720
talking to rusty I'm freaking out yeah it's the it's the GM's job to paint a picture we're waiting

45:44.720 --> 45:53.120
Liz lonklin you're walking through this massive trees and you are all alone as the Sun is going

45:53.120 --> 45:59.400
down it is almost pure darkness and at that point it's a clear sky and the only thing you'll be able

45:59.480 --> 46:05.760
to see by is moonlight and you know that and time is running out and you are freaking the fuck out

46:05.760 --> 46:12.480
but as you make your way back to the trail you finally find it and as soon as you do you see a

46:12.480 --> 46:20.800
campsite just off to the right in which you see Jeremy Pettymore and can clink it crinkle crinkle

46:20.800 --> 46:29.160
ha and they are two freshmen from Silas Cole K through 12 Jeremy Pettymore you would know only

46:29.320 --> 46:38.680
by name as the whole Pettymore clan is just a full big old family of rust abouts and and there do

46:38.680 --> 46:46.120
wells and can clinkle ha fuck me you can call me whatever you want it's crinkle ha can crinkle

46:46.120 --> 46:55.200
ha is a freshman as well at Silas Cole K through 12 and he is the star sport athlete at Silas Cole

46:55.240 --> 47:01.200
K through 12 he is the future of this school the two of you would know that Liz lonklin is a total

47:01.200 --> 47:08.360
badass always wearing her Doc Martens always disrespecting anyone who steps to her and as the

47:08.360 --> 47:13.560
two of you are trying to calm each other down essentially well more so Jeremy is trying to

47:13.560 --> 47:22.160
calm down Ken as you're talking to this man who is cut up and bloody and muddy and almost feral

47:22.160 --> 47:28.360
but you're you're treating him with some with some nice little winkies and Liz you see this

47:28.360 --> 47:37.080
as you approach their campsite winky wanky wanky terrible they're little Smokies thank you that's

47:37.080 --> 47:44.480
different yeah oh is it yeah what way with little well this is like a feral man you guys don't like

47:44.480 --> 47:49.000
it when I describe it in depth you don't like it when I describe it vague no I don't like you

47:49.000 --> 47:59.960
describing little Smokies is like little ding dongs little Johnson's small meat fellas there

47:59.960 --> 48:09.120
thank you I hear Liz approach and I should ash ash is that you ash no but ash is in trouble who

48:09.120 --> 48:17.200
are you wait I would know them you just said that but you might definitely say who are you I'm Liz

48:17.240 --> 48:22.280
Laughlin who the hell are you I see that it's not ash and I go oh fuck and I try to kind of block

48:22.280 --> 48:29.680
her view from seeing the tied-up bloody man I think Liz would be one of the few like Jeremy

48:29.680 --> 48:33.840
would probably definitely know her from school and the town and she's probably one of the few

48:33.840 --> 48:39.600
people he like looks up to and respects absolutely he's a little wannabe Punk too well you are a punk

48:39.600 --> 48:46.760
he wants to be a punk all right cool oh hey hey we got this wild man you want to feed him a smoky

48:46.760 --> 48:54.800
why the hell do you have a guy tied up over here what the fuck are you guys doing out here he was

48:54.800 --> 49:01.600
just out here kind of screaming and you know acting a fool so ash wrestled him into the ground and I

49:01.600 --> 49:08.400
I tied him up but then he it just seems like a little some kind of dog man so I was gonna give

49:08.400 --> 49:13.080
him Smokies and try to try to pacify him well why are you guys worried about this guy when like your

49:13.080 --> 49:17.800

49:31.960 --> 49:38.800

49:38.800 --> 49:54.440

49:59.920 --> 50:05.120
his arm is stuck in a tree was he trying to climb it he got wedged in a branch he didn't tell me his

50:05.120 --> 50:10.160

51:16.640 --> 51:22.640
Ken sometimes you have to do what's right and not what's gonna look good to a college admissions

51:22.640 --> 51:28.640
board well all right I know associated with wild men ain't the kind of thing that you want to be

51:28.640 --> 51:34.360
seen around cuz you're you're some kind of fucking you know achiever now and you're better than the

51:34.360 --> 51:39.560
rest of us but once you was down in the muck covered in in scratches just like rusty here I

51:39.560 --> 51:44.440
don't know what you guys are going through but I ran into some wild man out there in the woods

51:44.440 --> 51:49.400
there's more wild man yeah surrounded by like a line of like some kind of white powder and he

51:49.400 --> 51:53.720
was telling me that if I leave by myself something will get me so I don't want to leave this guy by

51:53.720 --> 52:01.320
himself yeah we let's take him he is this man is like holding out his hand for another tiny meat

52:01.320 --> 52:08.120
fell and I put I put one in there and he immediately just like holds it with fingers of both

52:08.120 --> 52:15.080
hands and just like and that's just the cutest and then he smiles and he looks back up at you

52:15.080 --> 52:21.920
and he holds out his hand for another can I just look at give Ken I don't like it but can can look

52:21.920 --> 52:28.960

52:52.920 --> 52:57.920
he was snarling and gnashing and and there was just there was something in his eyes I could tell

52:57.920 --> 53:02.640
that if you've got free he would want to hurt us it's just something I just saw it it was a flash

53:02.640 --> 53:09.040
well just keep him tied up and smokey it'll be fine listen for all we know this is Jim

53:09.040 --> 53:19.520
Carrey preparing for a role he smiles nods and holds out his hand to Ken oh you're right is Jim

53:19.520 --> 53:27.720
Carrey how is he tied up well can he's tied up well he keeps holding out his hand so obviously

53:27.720 --> 53:34.320
his hands is free they're bound together and bound to his feet but he just enough to to reach

53:34.320 --> 53:39.880
out a little bit for a if his hands are bound to his feet how's he reaching his mouth with the meat

53:39.880 --> 53:47.200
he stretched he's stretchy yeah he's bendy stretchy and he's naked how's his dick it's like weird

53:47.200 --> 54:01.880
looking we can't leave this poor little dick he'll starve out here with a dick like that

54:01.880 --> 54:15.040

54:15.040 --> 54:29.440
tree yeah I don't want to take this guy with us do you really not want a wild man pet this guy

54:29.440 --> 54:39.360

56:24.840 --> 56:43.080
shadow Judy and a raccoon are walking back down the trail to the trailhead Judy is walking with

56:43.080 --> 56:55.320
her arms inside of her onesie sleeves probably following behind the two adorable a raccoon

56:55.320 --> 57:07.120
walking wait what am I supposed to say tell me I'm a raccoon two raccoons walking on their hind legs

57:07.160 --> 57:16.840
with their arms t-rexed in front of them tottering tottering from one side to the left and as you

57:16.840 --> 57:27.680
guys make your way back down you see the Sun is setting and it will be very dark very soon what

57:27.680 --> 57:33.320
are your guys's hopes and intentions with this trip I hope to look death in the face that's

57:33.320 --> 57:38.720
about it that's like my primary goal in life and Ali what about Judy Judy is just really worried

57:38.720 --> 57:45.800
right now because she typically brushes her teeth at sunset and she has not been a she can feel like

57:45.800 --> 57:52.160
the plaque but she does just like running over her toothpaste if you'll remember in her pocket

57:52.160 --> 57:56.440
yeah she has never oh she does have her toothbrush toothpaste in her toothbrush but she's still

57:56.440 --> 58:00.400
really nervous about the hand sanitizer on her hand so she doesn't want to touch are you gonna

58:00.480 --> 58:10.080
use lake water to brush your teeth Judy she doesn't know she's very uncertain right now she also is

58:10.080 --> 58:15.720
very concerned about Liz but more concerned about her teeth her teeth okay how concerned is she

58:15.720 --> 58:24.960
about shadows well-being very little little to none I think about as much as shadow is worried

58:24.960 --> 58:33.840
about her so as you guys make your way back down you see the back of the little shack that is where

58:33.840 --> 58:39.840
the Ranger sits and you see all the cars in the parking lot all of the same cars are still these

58:39.840 --> 58:44.840
mom's cars there yes the minivan is still there is everything in the same condition seemingly yeah

58:44.840 --> 58:52.960
is the Ranger still there so as you guys turn the corner hello hello who go who is that and Judy you

58:52.960 --> 59:01.160
would recognize it as your mom's voice is it coming out of her mom it is coming out of the

59:01.160 --> 59:13.160
little shack at the trailhead okay shadow I don't want to freak you out but that is my mom yeah

59:13.160 --> 59:18.280
that's what I was expecting I really hope that she brought her water bottle so that I could use

59:18.280 --> 59:25.160
some of it to brush my teeth we should probably go up there and find her mom mom wait wait wait

59:25.160 --> 59:31.160
wait wait Judy I listen to the racoon and I just look over at the racoon and the racoon throws its

59:31.160 --> 59:37.760
hands up in a I don't know kind of situation can I pick up the racoon when you try to pick up the

59:37.760 --> 59:43.360
racoon it like backs away from you stands its ground gives you a thumbs up okay I return the

59:43.360 --> 59:51.520
thumbs up okay it reaches out for a high five I reject the racoon hangs its head and walks back

59:51.520 --> 59:56.000
toward the parking lot Judy's starting to get pretty freaked out she really wants she really

59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.400
wants that water bottle for my mom so mom mom mom hello hello is who is that who is there and you

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:11.040
see as you turn the corner that Krista Krinklehoff is poking her head out the little window of the

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:17.120
shack and is looking around and sees the two of you with a raccoon what are you what what are you

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:26.320
guys doing Krista have you used the hand sanitizer um yes as everyone should and then she like grabs

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:33.640
a thing of hand sanitizer from behind the bar if you will and puts it up on the little shelf the

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:40.600
little little ledge of the shack everyone should be washing their hands as opposed to you know

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:47.120
getting all higgledy-piggledy or anything else like you you must use hand sanitizer and not you

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:53.200
know bark at knots and you know it's the important thing to do her Krinklehoff household tradition

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.960
when Judy sees a bottle of hand sanitizer she runs to it and puts it in her hands she's already

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.920
forgotten that the raccoon told us not to use it and the raccoon will try to stop you from doing

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:16.240
this so let's roll a unarmed combat against each other here I got a five on a thirty the raccoon

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:22.320
got a four which if we play prices right rules so the highest number wins as long as you stay

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:28.920
under your staff so you fight this raccoon off to get some hand sanitizer and you put a bunch

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.880
in your hands yes that is absolutely right young miss you should definitely be using this I I don't

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:41.480
understand why what it is that uh brought made you bring a raccoon with you back out into the

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:52.360
parking lot of the woods it's okay it's fine you don't need to look at him or think about him at

01:01:52.360 --> 01:02:01.560
all or you even be here even you could why why are you here I would like to humant Krista sure to

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:09.640
see if like she's a little brainwashed from the hand sanitizer okay roll a human for me I passed

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:18.840
34 and a 40 34 on a 40 would tell you that she is not in the same state that Judy was earlier when

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:25.760
she seemed to lose her shit okay daughter I am here because the man who was here earlier asked

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:33.800
me to watch his stead for the time being because he heard that there were some some folks out there

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:39.040
just wobbling jaws and and and he was afraid that they might you know get their barking irons out

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:46.120
and take care of business and we can't have anyone shooting guns and making mayhem out here in the

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.120
woods with all these missing people Judy is no longer listening to her mom she's digging in her

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.840
mom's purse to see if she has any water that she can use to brush her teeth she does have some

01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:01.800
water and she will you can brush your teeth Judy brushes her teeth do you just do it like standing

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.000
out yeah she's like hanging her head out the door like ravenously brushing your teeth like it's been

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:17.160
years like it's been years so I taught her over to the raccoon mm-hmm and the raccoon like throws

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:26.240
its thumb again to the exit of the woods Judy I think that we should go back and get Liz Judy

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.480
looks up and she has toothpaste all over her mouth she says I really don't want to go back

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:39.360
into the woods right now I just want to stay with the raccoon probably you could go maybe

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.800
alone Judy I'm not sure that anyone could comfort Liz the way that you can you know about your

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:54.680
special connection Judy you left your friend Liz out in the woods all alone oh mom you don't need

01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:08.240
to worry about that everything is fine Liz is probably just skinny dipping oh my goodness what

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:15.440
was your name again mom this is my very best friend shadow so sorry of course shadow shadow

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:22.440
you should go back into the woods and grab Liz I will wait here and Judy you can wait here with

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:29.600
me and then we will all leave together so Krista as much as I would love to do that because I feel

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:36.000
very comfortable and one with everything in nature I'm a little confused as to why you the

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.160
mother of my best friend would want me to go back into the woods by myself where several people have

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:48.200
gone missing okay well I will go back in with you if you would like and Judy you can stay here and

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.560
wait for us to come back that's a really good idea maybe probably the raccoon should stay with me

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.640
yes I completely agree okay that's great also could you leave your purse so I could have some

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:05.840
of those breath mints I really absolutely okay all right Krista let's have some real bonding time so

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:12.320
that maybe for once in your JD life you can remember my name oh you are a little firecracker

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:20.360
aren't you thank you Judy wait will you just watch it until the man comes back who's here he's the

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:29.440
what was he the the Woodrow fella the the whatever what was his thing he was the Ranger yes until the

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:35.080
Ranger comes back if you could stay here and the raccoon friend I suppose can can stay here as

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:41.280
well with the breath mints and then she leaves back up the trail with shadow I grab her hand

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:47.800
and kind of force her to skip with me into the forest she will reluctantly join you and said

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:56.880
skipping okay I might also sing a song oh what would that song be death is all around us just

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:08.520
look at its unrelenting eyes something like that something like that it's unrelenting eyes

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:35.840
Judy you've got your breath mints your teeth are brushed you've got your mom's water I need you to

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:46.840
roll a sanity check for me I got a 34 on a 34 oh that's a success congratulations you hold it

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:53.200
together even though your vision is starting to blur you're still going to lose one sanity okay

01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.720
but that is just going to make the world around you slowly it's as if it's going to turn the way

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:08.320
it did earlier but it doesn't quite make it fully you just see your vision is rippling and the raccoon

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:15.920
is walking back from around the side of the building and it looks at you with these dead

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:23.760
eyes that are just like horrified and scared and it motions for you to follow it okay and I do it

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:30.680
leads you to the small restroom attached to this Rangers welcome shack and as you approach the

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:38.840
heavy metal door the Sun finally finishes its shift from the inside of this trailhead restroom

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:48.200
we see the scratched up brown door open and Judy Krinklehoff is backlit only by the single

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:54.760
flickering light illuminating the contention woods parking area I'm gonna need a sanity check here

01:07:54.760 --> 01:08:06.160
yeah 26 on a 33 even with the success you lose one sanity as your mind tries to comprehend what

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.840
you are seeing she's starting to go a little numb so she's obviously she's freaked out her

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.080
hands are shaking a little bit and she's breathing a little heavy but she doesn't want to run she's

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:23.760
she just keeps staring at it she can't look away and we zoom up to Judy's shaking hands and her

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:36.240
dead stare from her eyes we see the body of Ed buzz Woodrow still in his state ranger uniform

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:46.360
but his limp body is on the dirty bathroom floor and it's been folded neatly like a freshly pressed

01:08:46.360 --> 01:09:16.240
shirt. She runs. She runs. She runs. The sun is sleeping soon. She knows. She knows.

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:32.720
She knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:10:13.720
She moves. She moves. She moves with the howling wind. The sun. The sun. The sun has come again.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:35.560
Her eyes have seen it all. The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
