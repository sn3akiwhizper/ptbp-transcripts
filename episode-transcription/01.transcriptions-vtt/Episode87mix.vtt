Hello small beans one and all, it's your big bean zaddy, Wolf the Daddy.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.860
But no really, it's Wolf the Dog.

00:09.860 --> 00:17.260
And I am here to meme and scream till I deem this a proper scene that seems to lean mean

00:17.260 --> 00:24.160
from a serene scheme that beams live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:24.160 --> 00:30.840
Pee-pees, sheepies, tee-hees, creepies, wee-wees.

00:32.840 --> 00:38.280
Hey, do you want to give my producer here some solid info on what you like about this

00:38.280 --> 00:39.520
here show?

00:39.520 --> 00:44.200
What we could improve upon and that sort of such ain't happenin's?

00:44.200 --> 00:49.180

01:28.760 --> 01:30.760

I click every link I see no matter where it's from or who sent it to me, and that's wild

01:37.640 --> 01:42.760
because I don't even know how to get on the fuckin' internet, Bill Gates.

01:42.760 --> 01:49.460
If you're sick of basic ass juice, there's no excuse for not mixing in equal parts gin,

01:49.460 --> 01:52.500
cherry liqueur, and chartreuse.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.060
It's time for the news.

01:55.060 --> 02:00.420
Last time, Keith and Pastor Adam Kane went through the impassable metal plate, the door

02:00.420 --> 02:05.700
at the bottom of Bean's pond, and Daddy passed the fuck out due to impact.

02:05.700 --> 02:12.700
Keith shot him in both feets before headin' out down an old mine elevator to a cavernous

02:12.700 --> 02:13.700
laboratory.

02:13.700 --> 02:19.700
Above ground, Clark didn't throw away his shot, which he missed, but it led Casey Kristoff

02:19.700 --> 02:26.160
to have his hand blown off by a shot from the clandestine carbine of Anne Love, codename

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
Karen.

02:27.160 --> 02:33.040
And then, there was a very good conversation happenin' between Clark Bishop and Anne Love.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.480
They got into a whole thing about the asylum?

02:35.480 --> 02:39.440
Woof, I bet there's more of that comin' soon.

02:39.440 --> 02:46.160
Down in the underground lab, Keith found the drafts for an old camera, radio, gun, and

02:46.160 --> 02:47.160
helmet.

02:47.160 --> 02:52.360
He also found the blueprints for a ball, the 25th of which worked.

02:52.360 --> 02:58.540
M-A-R-Y, you ain't got no alibi, you ugly.

02:58.540 --> 03:04.820
Except for you, dear listener, you are beautiful beyond imagination, and you obviously remember

03:04.820 --> 03:10.800
that Keith then attempted to cast a spell of eternal life on himself that caused his

03:10.800 --> 03:15.140
nails to pop off like a movie theater concession stand.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.700
Mmm, butter.

03:16.700 --> 03:23.900
Now, dear listener, what is your favorite thing to put on top of a heated dry corn?

03:23.900 --> 03:28.220
Some say butter, some say premarison cheese.

03:28.220 --> 03:32.020
I say it's kudzu with no backbone.

03:58.220 --> 04:04.740
Anne Love, code name Karen, looks right at Clark Bishop and says,

04:04.740 --> 04:10.420
W-wait a second, so...

04:10.420 --> 04:11.420
Where's Leon?

04:11.420 --> 04:14.140
He's, uh, he's helpin' with somethin' else.

04:14.140 --> 04:18.340
Yeah, but he was sent for... did you send him somewhere else?

04:18.340 --> 04:19.700
Yes.

04:19.700 --> 04:26.460
Roll Persuade.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.460
I pass.

04:27.460 --> 04:29.340
Uh, 35 on a 40.

04:29.340 --> 04:30.340
Okay.

04:30.340 --> 04:31.900
Well, we better get going.

04:31.900 --> 04:37.060
Wait, Anne, I gotta... what do you know about Maggie?

04:37.060 --> 04:41.980
I mean, I know the takeover has been pretty brutal.

04:41.980 --> 04:42.980
The takeover?

04:42.980 --> 04:43.980
That's kinda what I'm wondering about.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.860
Well yeah, because Jim had to die, right?

04:45.860 --> 04:52.260
Because of the revelations of the Overseer, which he wasn't stoked about, but Maggie was

04:52.260 --> 04:55.020
seemingly completely on board with.

04:55.020 --> 04:59.820
And when that actually came to fruition, she saw her place and came to claim it.

04:59.820 --> 05:01.200
Why did Jim have to die?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.220
Because of the revelation of the Overseer?

05:03.220 --> 05:06.100
I read a bit of that, and I don't remember seeing...

05:06.100 --> 05:07.620
Okay, walk and talk, walk and talk.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.220
This is all... we gotta get to your, uh... you still live at your parents' house, right?

05:12.220 --> 05:13.220
We can't...

05:13.220 --> 05:14.220
Keith's down in the hole.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.900
We can't leave Keith down there.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.120
Oh, right.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.100
Can you help us get our buddy out of this hole?

05:19.100 --> 05:21.820
She looks down at it, and she kinda, like, steps on it.

05:22.020 --> 05:24.540
I don't know, seems like an impassable metal plate.

05:24.540 --> 05:25.540
Hahahaha.

05:25.540 --> 05:29.180
I don't... we haven't even, like, tried to pick it up or anything.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.660
I'd like to try to do that.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.540
Okay, three, two... remember?

05:32.540 --> 05:33.660
Legs, not back.

05:33.660 --> 05:34.660
Three, two...

05:34.660 --> 05:35.660
Hey, Councilwoman?

05:35.660 --> 05:36.660
You gonna help?

05:36.660 --> 05:37.660
Three, two, one.

05:37.660 --> 05:42.460
And you guys, you can't get your fingers more than half an inch underneath it.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.960
And there's just mud.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.460
It's seemingly just this metal plate.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.460
There's nothing under... what was I saying?

05:49.460 --> 05:50.460
I doubt it.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.460
I don't know.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.100
Maggie?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.100
Sure.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.100
Hahahaha.

05:55.100 --> 05:59.580
Oh, right, the Revelation of the Overseer.

05:59.580 --> 06:05.380
So, like, when you couldn't get your parent's book, cause I failed, Kevin here failed, we

06:05.380 --> 06:06.380
failed.

06:06.380 --> 06:09.660
Also, you know, sorry about all that.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.960
But we couldn't get the book, so he tried to create his own, right?

06:12.960 --> 06:17.580
But when it happened, the only thing that came out of it was that fucking picture, that

06:17.580 --> 06:23.980
creepy, creepy picture of the guy, the hood, the light says, you know, he should not...

06:23.980 --> 06:26.220
It's only through death that he shall rise again.

06:26.220 --> 06:30.540
Oh, such an excellent member of the circle of knowledge you've already become.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.900
And there was a letter in it, right?

06:32.900 --> 06:36.360
Cause letters pop out of that one, it's like, you can't do shit with that book, but sometimes

06:36.360 --> 06:37.360
letters pop out?

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
I don't know.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.480
But it was called the Revelations of the Overseer, and it was this thing that was just like on

06:42.480 --> 06:47.820
and on about how Jim had to die in order for the world to be safe and blah, blah, blah.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.360
So anyway, Jim obviously didn't like that a whole lot, but...

06:50.360 --> 06:53.160
You were friends with Jim, right?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.680
Friends is an interesting term.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.200
Well, you said he kind of recruited you, like, you guys had a relationship before the circle

07:00.200 --> 07:01.200
of knowledge.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.200
Yeah, he was my handler.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
He was our handler.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.200
Uh...

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
Cool!

07:05.200 --> 07:13.040
Would you happen to know what the meaning behind a tarot card with a devil on it might

07:13.040 --> 07:14.040
be?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.040
Does that ring a bell for you?

07:15.040 --> 07:20.120
I mean, Satan, but that seems more big picture and not really what we're doing here.

07:20.120 --> 07:24.640
Seems like we never really made that a focus and therefore just kind of fell off the plot

07:24.640 --> 07:27.720
line structure of this whole thing.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
Satan?

07:28.720 --> 07:29.720
Yeah.

07:29.720 --> 07:34.800
Jack was Satan, you're a big bad.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.160
Well I think it was more of like a code name.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.720
Basically we're not here to try to take down Myriad.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.760
That would be, that would take a bit of, you know, intelligence and time.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.360
So you know about Myriad, you know those creatures.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.080
Jim told us what he wanted to about Myriad, yeah.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.160
What was that?

07:56.160 --> 07:59.720
We really need to get going if we're going to make it to CCC.

07:59.720 --> 08:04.040
Circle of knowledge to a circle of knowledge member, what is Myriad to us?

08:04.040 --> 08:11.880
To you I don't know, but Myriad is the group that runs the government, is that a good

08:11.880 --> 08:12.880
way of saying it?

08:12.880 --> 08:13.880
Yeah, it checks out.

08:13.880 --> 08:18.400
Basically we made a deal with them to use their technology if they could, you know,

08:18.400 --> 08:21.160
have some sway in political matters.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.160
You met Marvin, right?

08:22.160 --> 08:27.360
He was a rebel, I guess with a cause, if that cause is just attaining power.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.220
And then why did you kill my parents?

08:29.220 --> 08:30.760
To get the book that we never found.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.760
Sorry about that.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.000
If we found it I would have felt better about killing your parents, but I bet it's still

08:35.000 --> 08:38.500
at your house, so if we could go get that actually, that would be dope.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.400
You killed them because you couldn't find it?

08:40.400 --> 08:47.800
I was sent there to kill, yes, Jim essentially hired us to go get the book, but he, he told

08:47.800 --> 08:52.440
me it all means necessary.

08:52.440 --> 08:56.680
I mean even though they were his friends, technically, I guess if you want to call that

08:56.680 --> 08:57.680
friendship.

08:57.680 --> 09:02.000
He had them under the San Ferra Blum situation, so I guess it's not really friendship, but

09:02.000 --> 09:04.680
even that couldn't get the information out of them.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.120
San Ferra Blum, we've heard that mentioned.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.360
What is that?

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
It's the project!

09:09.360 --> 09:12.200
At Calm Comfy Campground!

09:12.200 --> 09:18.640
It's the whole thing, with the flowers, and the city, you know, we've been using it in

09:18.640 --> 09:24.520
the city for a while, and then Myriad wanted us to go country-wide with it, but then James

09:24.520 --> 09:31.760
for some reason freaked out about that plan and fucked everything up for, not for long,

09:31.760 --> 09:33.280
Maggie's going through with it.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.320
But what does San Ferra Blum do?

09:35.320 --> 09:40.240
Pacifies the mind, essentially, so it makes people more malleable, right, so like everyone

09:40.240 --> 09:44.600
in the city basically works for Bar Corp at this point, which is one of our subsidiaries

09:44.600 --> 09:51.400
that we own, so basically the idea is that it's like, people are calling it New World

09:51.400 --> 09:54.680
Order, but basically it's just making sure that chaos doesn't happen.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.840
Could this New World Order protect a man of means such as myself?

09:58.840 --> 10:03.040
Kevin, are you talking about the money from all the cocaine we're probably gonna sell

10:03.040 --> 10:05.000
as soon as this is over?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Hahahaha!

10:06.000 --> 10:09.200
Cause if so, then hell yeah.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
Yes.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.320
Going to sell.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.320
What did that mean?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.320
That seemed like a thing.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.320
No it didn't.

10:14.320 --> 10:22.040
Hahahaha!

10:22.040 --> 10:31.140
You know, this is an audio medium and I can't convey my inner intentions with a glance or...

10:31.140 --> 10:37.480
You can join the Den of Sin for $15 to get those glances on our Patreon content over

10:37.480 --> 10:41.320
at patreon.com slash pretending pod, that was all, and love talking.

10:42.320 --> 10:49.640
Uh, yeah, no we're definitely gonna be of means, but Kevin, you are primed to join Circle

10:49.640 --> 10:54.840
of Knowledge, and with that comes, you know, whatever you want, but more than money it's

10:54.840 --> 11:02.080
a sense of pride of saving the world from total destruction, but also on top of that

11:02.080 --> 11:06.360
you get literally anything you want cause money doesn't really matter anymore for us.

11:06.400 --> 11:11.360
Well, but, I mean, with the San Ferablam and Marriott stuff, aren't you kinda just destroying

11:11.360 --> 11:13.240
the world in the name of saving it?

11:13.240 --> 11:17.160
I had some qualms with that too, Maggie didn't mention this New World Order stuff, I was

11:17.160 --> 11:19.240
signing up to stop a monster.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.240
Yeah, well that's how we're doing it.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.240
By creating one?

11:22.240 --> 11:26.120
Well, I don't, I wouldn't say that we're creating a monster necessarily as...

11:26.120 --> 11:29.360
You know, Maggie showed me that creature, have you seen it?

11:29.360 --> 11:32.040
The Gigantombropypicus?

11:32.040 --> 11:33.880
I didn't, she didn't tell me its name.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.920
Oh yeah, that shit is mad fucked.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
I'm sorry, what?

11:36.920 --> 11:37.920
Gigantombropypicus?

11:37.920 --> 11:41.080
Yeah, sorry, I'm not in your club, what's...

11:41.080 --> 11:45.920
Seriously, Kevin, you are absolutely gonna join the Circle of Knowledge after this, which,

11:45.920 --> 11:54.040
if we could get to the CCC, that was the original, the original game plan.

11:54.040 --> 11:58.720
But I guess we could get the book first, get the book and then go to CCC, cause the book,

11:58.720 --> 12:03.000
I mean your town here, no offense, completely fucked probably unless we figure out a way

12:03.000 --> 12:06.960
which the book is probably the way that we can solve all this ooze and goo or whatever

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
you're talking about.

12:07.960 --> 12:13.040
Did you know that Adam thought that he could somehow change all this?

12:13.040 --> 12:14.040
Who's Adam?

12:14.040 --> 12:15.680
Adam is the man, uh...

12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
He's down in that hole.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
In the hole.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.680
Oh, the helmet guy?

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
Yeah.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.680
No, I don't know who that is.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.080
Do you know what he thought was down there?

12:23.080 --> 12:24.080
Have you seen this door before?

12:24.080 --> 12:27.320
Do you know anything about what's going on here at Bean's Pond?

12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
No.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.320
Did you say how you found us?

12:29.320 --> 12:36.000
Well yeah, I came to town to break into your house, and then I saw this big floating wall

12:36.000 --> 12:45.780
of water that was filled with fish, and I thought to myself, you know what, that might

12:45.780 --> 12:47.840
be a place that I wanna go.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.380
And then it turns out my old partner's fucking here.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.360
And she kinda like goes up and elbows you?

12:52.360 --> 12:56.120
When we got to town, we were saving the fish wall thingy for last.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.640
Oh, well we did opposites, I suppose.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.520
Seemed like the most exciting thing.

13:01.520 --> 13:07.000
Maybe we should just go for the big fish wall next time.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.160
That's what Anne Love would do.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.040
Oh, by the way, my name's Anne Love.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.720
I don't know if you knew that.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.960
Hi, my name's John Lee Pettymore.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.200
Same as my daddy and my daddy before.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.840
Oh, for real?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.840
That's like, that's your actual name?

13:19.840 --> 13:20.840
Yeah.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.160
Oh damn, that's me.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.160
Okay, cool.

13:23.160 --> 13:24.160
John.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.160
Nice to meet you, John.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.200
Thanks, man.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.040
Alright, you guys wanna go continue to save the world?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.040
We gotta kill this cat, though.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.040
Provisionally.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
Oh, we should kill this cat.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.040
I don't care.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.040
We gotta kill this cat.

13:34.040 --> 13:39.920
At that point, Agent Shrink Cat, who's on top of the radio, has turned from being extremely

13:39.920 --> 13:46.080
hopeful that John Lee Pettymore would help him ooze his way into this radio to like,

13:46.080 --> 13:47.080
wait, what?

13:47.080 --> 13:51.640
I thought he turned on us after my offer of, he threw gun, he threw dirt in my gun.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.840
Yeah, he thought you were gonna kill him.

13:53.840 --> 13:58.520
He recently, though, has been pointing at, he was pointing at the on-off switch on the

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
thing?

13:59.520 --> 14:03.160
Yeah, he was pointing at the broken tube of the radio, and then he was pointing at John.

14:03.160 --> 14:08.160
He was mostly just afraid when you failed the role, it was less of a, like, turning

14:08.160 --> 14:13.260
him on you, more of a, he's still afraid that you're gonna try to kill him kind of thing.

14:13.260 --> 14:17.160
But with the conversation that's been happening since then, especially the one where he got

14:17.160 --> 14:26.120
outed as, uh, a member of a, uh, posing force, if you will, of the unnatural, he's gotten

14:26.120 --> 14:27.120
worried.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.120
Hold on, Ann.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.120
I think he's more of a use to us alive than dead.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.360
Okay, well, you know.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.360
I wink at the cat.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.480
The cat winks back.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.520
Cool.

14:37.520 --> 14:45.160
And Carrie Pages is, like, sitting in the mud, just kind of, like, drawing in it.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
Hey, Drew.

14:46.160 --> 14:53.440
Hey, yeah, no, sorry, um, this is all going way over my head, and I would rather not have

14:53.440 --> 14:59.460
this knowledge if it means that, if it's gonna make me feel worse in my head space, then

14:59.460 --> 15:02.000
I would rather not have this knowledge.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.160
So I would like to go home, I guess.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.680
Drew, I understand.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.880
I totally understand.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.720
Drew, I was, I was hoping I could ask you a couple questions before you, before we got

15:12.720 --> 15:13.720
you home.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.720
Is that okay?

15:14.760 --> 15:17.000
With some of the knowledge that's in your head space?

15:17.000 --> 15:23.120
Yes, no, of course, um, I am willing to answer any questions from you guys, obviously, as

15:23.120 --> 15:25.320
long as Miss Karen...

15:25.320 --> 15:26.320
Karen, we'll...

15:26.320 --> 15:27.500
Yeah, we'll be right with you, Karen.

15:27.500 --> 15:32.320
We'll head your way after we finish talking to Miss Pages here.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.320
Councilwoman?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
Yes, of course.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.480
Can you tell me what you learned from your time at, uh...

15:37.480 --> 15:38.480
Big winks.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.480
Yeah.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.600
At the side of Adam there?

15:42.600 --> 15:43.600
What happened?

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
Were you at the church?

15:44.600 --> 15:47.160
Well, he points to the radio.

15:47.160 --> 15:53.560
They used that to switch our bodies, of course, and then I was blindfolded and held in a,

15:53.560 --> 15:56.800
in a side room until I was brought here.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.520
Oh, good.

15:58.520 --> 16:05.160
How did the, how'd they get ahold of you in the, in the first place?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.840
Were you, were you attacked, kidnapped?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.080
Did you seek them out?

16:08.080 --> 16:09.080
What happened here?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.080
Oh yeah, no, right.

16:10.080 --> 16:17.000
So, I was out and about, and I was getting a cat carrier for you all, and then we had

16:17.000 --> 16:23.840
a phone conversation, and then I believe it was that old, um, oh, what's his name?

16:23.840 --> 16:24.840
That ne'er-do-well.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.840
Terrence.

16:25.840 --> 16:31.880
Yeah, Terrence Liquor and, uh, the other one, the Rocky Balboa little fella.

16:31.880 --> 16:32.880
Fade.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.880
Oh yeah, Fade.

16:33.880 --> 16:38.880
Uh, Fade, can't pronounce his last name, was, uh, they, they came and they, they grabbed

16:38.880 --> 16:42.120
me and they, they brought me to the church.

16:42.120 --> 16:46.120
And did they ever mention a plan or a goal with you?

16:46.120 --> 16:50.760
Well, yeah, they were going to sacrifice everyone's bodies in order to get the pastor to go back

16:50.760 --> 16:57.760
in time to save the world, I guess was their plan, but it never made much sense to me because

16:57.760 --> 17:00.200
I had all the faith in the world and the three of you.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.200
Aw.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.200
Thanks, Drew.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.200
We're still working.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.880
Yeah, how much, how, how much progress did they make on that sacrifice and everybody's

17:06.880 --> 17:07.880
body's part?

17:07.880 --> 17:15.560
Well, no, it was supposed to be an all-at-once deal, so, I mean, yeah, I mean, bodies were,

17:15.560 --> 17:19.160
were useful, but he, he was mostly keeping everyone alive.

17:19.160 --> 17:25.960
I would assume that they're all still at the first church of contention, but then looking

17:25.960 --> 17:32.220
around, I guess the first church of contention is unguarded currently.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.160
It does seem like the water's here and not there.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.080
I mean, there might be enough puddles there for everyone.

17:38.080 --> 17:42.260
That's what they were calling the pools where they could hide from this, they kept calling

17:42.260 --> 17:43.400
it residue.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.400
We call it goo.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.400
Oh, from the goo.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.400
I like that much better.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
Well, you were there.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.400
You're Drew.

17:48.400 --> 17:54.920
Yes, I am and I've always liked that much better.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.040
It's hard to do one voice when you're trying to be in the mind of another.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.440
I can only imagine.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.120
Del Blanc, they always talk about a sign that he was such a great voice actor.

18:08.120 --> 18:15.280
He did like Porky Pig and, uh, he could do his other characters doing his other characters.

18:15.280 --> 18:19.480
So he could do like Elmer Fudd doing Porky Pig or whatever.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.480
Yeah.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.480
What would that sound like?

18:22.480 --> 18:23.480
I can't do either.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.480
Normally.

18:24.480 --> 18:30.600
Why, get that wasque, wasque, wasque, wasque rabbit.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
Nailed it.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
Yeah.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.200
I turned to John.

18:34.200 --> 18:40.480
My one idea now is we could send Drew back to his body with the radio and the four wheeler

18:40.480 --> 18:46.680
and we give him something to do, maybe put him back in his own body and we could go with

18:46.680 --> 18:47.680
Anne here.

18:47.680 --> 18:52.520
I was only eavesdropping a little bit, but that sounds fantastic to me.

18:52.520 --> 18:57.120
If you could direct me in the right direction, then I could get back into my own body and

18:57.120 --> 19:05.480
not be, and Drew kind of looks down and it's like in Gary Page's body.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.720
Do we trust the sewer people with the radio?

19:07.720 --> 19:10.040
I trust Gary and Harry for sure.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.400
Who's all down there?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.520
Mildred Mitchell's down there.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.720
And then your body is down there.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.320
Last we left it, it was unconscious.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.320
Is it hurt?

19:18.320 --> 19:21.040
It took a couple of spills, but nothing you can't handle, Drew.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.040
Yeah.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.440
Okay, well let's get going.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.000
That sounds like a great idea to me.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.460
If you'll excuse me, Kitty.

19:26.460 --> 19:32.380
Back at Ang's house during that firefight out on the lawn, I picked up another snub

19:32.380 --> 19:33.380
does revolver.

19:33.380 --> 19:39.540
I'm going to hand that to Kerry, just in case it comes in handy.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.860
You got protection.

19:40.860 --> 19:41.860
Okay.

19:41.860 --> 19:47.720
And Kerry gets really emotional, looks at John Lee Pettymore the third and says, your

19:47.720 --> 19:57.240
son taught me how to shoot one of these and I will never forget him for that and everything

19:57.240 --> 19:58.800
that he's done for me.

19:58.800 --> 20:04.800
Big grin comes across my face and I put both hands on his shoulders and I said, no, Drew,

20:04.800 --> 20:06.320
bubble gum tree.

20:06.320 --> 20:13.320
And Kerry Page's eyes light up and Drew just like throws his arms around you.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.760
Hey little buddy.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.760
John, is this really you?

20:18.760 --> 20:19.760
More or less, yeah.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.760
Oh my God.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.980
This whole time I thought that it was, Oh my God.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.480
So we're all really indifferent.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.360
I mean, Clark, you're still Clark.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.360
Yeah.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.820
I mean, except for Clark and well, Keith is kind of MIA down the bottom of the pond,

20:32.820 --> 20:35.120
but otherwise it's just all a big switcheroo.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.460
Oh boy.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.920
This must be really confusing for everyone.

20:38.920 --> 20:43.480
Some folks have trouble keeping up with it, yeah, but not us.

20:43.480 --> 20:51.800
Well, John, I don't know how to repay you for, thank you.

20:51.800 --> 20:58.040
Then he turns, she turns, he turns to and love.

20:58.040 --> 21:03.480
And thank you, you, I think saved my life and puts out a hand.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.920
Maybe, maybe don't, maybe don't, maybe don't put out a hand.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.920
Oh, yep.

21:07.920 --> 21:08.920
Okay, sure.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.220
Uh, I'll just take this four wheeler then.

21:11.220 --> 21:17.380
If you guys want to direct me in the appropriate direction to hit the sewers and kitty, are

21:17.380 --> 21:19.620
you going with them or are you coming with me?

21:19.620 --> 21:22.660
And the cat is like pointing at the radio.

21:22.660 --> 21:30.140
I still think, I still think that we should kill it.

21:30.140 --> 21:34.060
Noted.

21:34.060 --> 21:38.620
This page is Harry put up a sign at clinkers showing you where to go.

21:38.620 --> 21:41.580
If you, if you can get to clinkers, you can, you can find them down there.

21:41.580 --> 21:47.980
You look to where clinkers would be because it's just like a block past this water wall.

21:47.980 --> 21:55.380
Anyway, here's water wall.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.380
Throwing it back to you.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.380
What do you guys want to do?

21:58.380 --> 22:01.900
John, do you think we should, uh, like leave a note or something?

22:01.900 --> 22:03.620
Keith is still just down there.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.840
I assume he's going to come back up at some point.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.440
You could probably write it in the mud.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.440
Go get rained away.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.440
I don't know.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.960
Hey, I'll probably figure it out, but if you want to leave something in the mud, that's

22:12.960 --> 22:13.960
fine with me.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.280
I'm going to pat down my uniform.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.520
Do I maybe have a notepad on me?

22:17.520 --> 22:21.600
As you guys are doing this, Drew is getting on the four wheeler.

22:21.600 --> 22:26.820
Wait, are we really going to go with and love the calm, comfy campground?

22:26.820 --> 22:30.960
We need to get in this fucking hole and gives you a salute.

22:30.960 --> 22:37.160
And then with the cat on the back, I feel like they drive up out of beans pond.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.160
We should have gone with him.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.160
Okay.

22:39.160 --> 22:48.040
When we started this entire campaign, my total, my absolute hope was that Drew Andrews and

22:48.040 --> 22:54.520
the body of Kerry pages would be driving the four wheeler that was brought here 25 years

22:54.520 --> 23:02.840
ago out of a dry beans pond with agent Trent, Chad, a city asylum employee in the body of

23:02.840 --> 23:12.480
Dr. Marie Andrews is cat Salem out and then toward clinkers to find a hidden message in

23:12.480 --> 23:20.120
the signs to find out where they are in the sewers and love is like, Hey, is that my four

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
wheeler?

23:21.120 --> 23:23.600
I felt like this has been pretty railroaded the whole time.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.400
You're right.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
It was obvious.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.360
You wanted us to get to hear it, man.

23:30.360 --> 23:38.320
We've been, I remember when you guys went to the city, I was like, Oh fuck.

23:38.320 --> 23:44.440
They don't understand my vision at all.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.440
God damn it.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.440
This has been fun.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.440
All right.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.440
It's not over yet.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.440
Not even by a little bit.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.880
So let's keep going.

23:50.880 --> 23:55.560
The four wheeler drives up and out and, and love looks at you and is like, why wouldn't

23:55.560 --> 23:56.840
you want to go with me?

23:56.840 --> 23:57.840
We need to go to Bishop's.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.240
We need to get the book.

23:59.240 --> 24:04.540
If you finally tell us where it is, then we could have it in the circle of knowledge.

24:04.540 --> 24:07.320
We can do whatever we want.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.200
Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Maggie.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.800
If you guys want to take over the three of us could take over and, and could you just

24:14.800 --> 24:17.080
give me, give me one, one second.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.960
And I want to pull John away a little bit.

24:19.040 --> 24:24.360
John, um, do you remember that whole business at the, at the college in our, in our last

24:24.360 --> 24:25.360
lives?

24:25.360 --> 24:26.360
Yeah.

24:26.360 --> 24:31.600
Right before all that happened, Leon wanted to take me to the common comfy campground

24:31.600 --> 24:36.320
and at the last minute had a change of heart and decided that we should investigate the

24:36.320 --> 24:40.660
college stuff, which I think we found out after the fact, it seemed kind of like a personal

24:40.660 --> 24:46.720
thing for him, but his actual mission was to get me to the common comfy campground.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.760
So it seems like the circle wants us there at least.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
Yeah.

24:50.760 --> 24:56.800
But we learned a lot about the circle just now that kind of makes it seem a little unsavory.

24:56.800 --> 25:01.560
I don't, I didn't like all that new new world order business, but the, the creature is real.

25:01.560 --> 25:06.320
The creature I saw and it could, it could end at all.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.320
Yeah.

25:07.320 --> 25:13.800
What if we kill Ann though and just focus on trying to get Keith out of that hole.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.480
I feel like someone or something is throwing a lot of distractions at us.

25:17.480 --> 25:21.040
I just want to focus on one thing.

25:21.040 --> 25:25.880
As much as I hate her, there's nothing that she could say or do that would ever make me

25:25.880 --> 25:28.720
call myself on her side.

25:28.720 --> 25:32.300
But at this point she's saying some of the right things that she doesn't necessarily

25:32.300 --> 25:35.840
care about Maggie, which we've had her doubts about Maggie.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.800
She knows a lot about what's going on.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.800
Clearly.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.800
She's not like got good intentions.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.800
I mean us in power means the new world order thing wouldn't happen.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.800
I think that happens no matter what we just be running it.

25:47.800 --> 25:53.760
I don't know if that'd be so bad if we could, if we could change it from the inside.

25:53.760 --> 26:00.680
I just want to watch my Smokies and sit around with my money and my family.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.680
How about, how about this?

26:01.680 --> 26:05.880
How about we just, you and I both know that killing her wouldn't be too much sweat off

26:05.880 --> 26:08.000
our backs, me especially.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.480
So let's just have that in our back pocket.

26:09.480 --> 26:13.080
The first time things get hanky, we can pop her.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.080
No questions asked.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.460
I think you're taking, I think you're trying to take us to comp company campground right

26:17.460 --> 26:19.840
now is the definition of hanky.

26:19.840 --> 26:20.840
Seems hanky to me.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.520
That's what I'm saying though is what about Keith man?

26:23.520 --> 26:25.280
I mean, yeah.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.280
What about Keith?

26:28.280 --> 26:40.960
Well, when you put it that way, I don't know, dude.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.960
I don't trust her.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.960
I don't think we should go.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
I don't like it.

26:43.960 --> 26:44.960
I think we got to help Keith.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.400
Well, how, how would we, how would we do that?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
Fuck.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
They opened the door somehow.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.520
I kind of wondered maybe and knows more about it than she's letting on.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.200
I was asking her about it.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.200
That's what I thought.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.760
I was hoping she would know that.

26:58.240 --> 27:03.120
I'm kind of wondering now if it opened because Keith was near it, it has his name on it.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.120
Yeah.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.120
That's not a bad thought.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.120
Oh, you know what it was?

27:06.120 --> 27:07.120
I bet it was the watch.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.400
He had the watch on.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.040
That savior and son of a bitch.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.240
Well.

27:12.240 --> 27:21.240
And at that exact moment, you hear a rushing of a waterfall as whatever unnatural force

27:21.240 --> 27:28.800
was holding up either side of this water wall relinquishes control and like a sheet of ice

27:28.800 --> 27:35.520
or a long cloth or a string of beads, this floating moat comes crashing down into the

27:35.520 --> 27:45.040
ground on mass, erupting both away from and into Bean's pond where the three of you are

27:45.040 --> 27:47.280
currently chit chatting.

27:47.280 --> 27:52.360
I need both of you to roll swim checks.

27:52.360 --> 27:57.440
That's something I sure as shit didn't put any points into.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.960
Ann Love rolled a four.

27:58.960 --> 27:59.960
Good for her.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
Oh my God.

28:00.960 --> 28:01.960
I pass.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.560
So I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 10.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.520
I have the baseline 20 and I rolled a 54.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.440
Clark, you see this thing.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.720
It's just.

28:11.720 --> 28:19.000
And from all sides simultaneously, this mushroom shaped lack of pond is filling back up and

28:19.000 --> 28:20.400
becoming a pond.

28:20.400 --> 28:27.200
And as you're trying to run, we got muddy feet and it's filling all the way to the top

28:27.200 --> 28:28.480
as you swim.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.640
You uh, you can stay afloat the entire time where you're only, you don't take in much

28:32.640 --> 28:35.440
water as you're making your way up out of there.

28:35.440 --> 28:40.960
John, you actually have some issues as John Lee Pettymore the third is trying to swim

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
out.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
You feel.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.960
You're kind of roboty.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.280
Is it sinking him?

28:45.280 --> 28:46.280
Holy shit.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.280
That's perfect.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.280
Yeah.

28:48.280 --> 28:52.560
John, you feel the weight of the metal in your endoskeleton pulling you further and

28:52.560 --> 28:57.560
further down into the murky fish frenzy that is beans pond.

28:57.560 --> 29:02.760
Oh, and you feel the intense buzzing inside your skull that you felt when you dunked your

29:02.760 --> 29:09.320
head into the truck bed puddle and the static is growing and growing, but suddenly you're

29:09.320 --> 29:14.560
moving upward toward the surface at a rapid clip.

29:14.560 --> 29:23.440
And as you break through the top of the water, you hear fossilism, fossilism, fossilism,

29:23.440 --> 29:30.200
and you see and love holding out one hand toward you and her other hand down at her

29:30.200 --> 29:31.200
feet.

29:31.200 --> 29:39.400
And she is standing on the pond and you are standing on the pond.

29:39.400 --> 29:44.360
She puts her hand on your shoulder and as you catch your breath, she walks you off of

29:44.360 --> 29:52.120
this teeming overflowing pond and onto the bank next to Clark Bishop, still ankle deep

29:52.120 --> 29:59.040
due to the excess water in the wall.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.040
Holy shit Kev lucky for you.

30:01.040 --> 30:13.040
I was here and we were going to kill you.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.520
What up dude?

30:14.520 --> 30:15.520
How you would have been.

30:15.520 --> 30:18.080
Oh, we got a screen share right off the bat.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.080
Oh boy.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.080
What are we?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.080
I just typed in borf.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
Okay.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.480
You didn't know what you were doing when you typed in borf.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.960
Oh, that is a, um, there's a furry.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.760
I like this one better.

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
Oh boy.

30:31.760 --> 30:36.760
Ooh, this is a borf gets you a lot of good stuff.

30:36.760 --> 30:41.160
On our call of Cthulhu game, uh, Luke learned what yiffing was.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.160
Oh yeah.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.160
Furry sex.

30:43.160 --> 30:47.640
That was, I don't know if that came from the chat or if that just came up.

30:47.640 --> 30:53.480
I don't remember why it came up, but when you look up borf, there's a fair amount of

30:53.480 --> 30:55.840
animal fucking going on in here.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.360
Oh, this guy's name's borf too.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.520
He's a little alien.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.000
It looks like a flubber became a person.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.720
It's like a flubber and Ghostbusters mix.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.720
Ew.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
Yeah.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.040
Oh, can you imagine if Robin Williams had been in Ghostbusters?

31:10.040 --> 31:11.040
I can't imagine.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.320
It would go a little something like this.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.280
Hey everybody, gotta get the ghost.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.280
Gotta get the ghost.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.280
Oh.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.280
Is that good?

31:19.280 --> 31:20.280
It was good enough.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.280
Trying these letters.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.280
We gotta call.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.280
We gotta call.

31:23.280 --> 31:31.400
It's a something.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.400
Funny always gets good stuff.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.400
Okay.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.520
Look, do you remember where we were last time?

31:37.520 --> 31:40.540
That is a baby with a handlebar mustache.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.320
It's a very good look.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.080
Advanced sharing options.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.540
Who can share?

31:45.540 --> 31:46.540
Only host.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.540
Aww.

31:47.540 --> 31:48.540
There it is.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.400
I guess I'll get out of this then.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.080
What a shame.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.320
It's fun being on Zoom calls with you, Luke.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.220
Let's play games.

31:58.220 --> 32:01.180
Let's play games.

32:01.180 --> 32:10.760
Last time you went down an elevator shaft, an old mining elevator down and then opened

32:10.760 --> 32:18.620
up a sealed blast door like from a bunker, entered a large cavernous room.

32:18.620 --> 32:19.660
Your ears popped.

32:19.660 --> 32:20.660
You did the yawn.

32:20.660 --> 32:21.660
I did.

32:21.660 --> 32:25.280
Sorry, what was that?

32:25.280 --> 32:29.460
It's a shame that this is only an audio medium because...

32:29.460 --> 32:39.320
Unless you subscribe to the Patreon, then once a month you get to watch me do this.

32:39.320 --> 32:44.780
So you went down here, you found papers that were blueprints for the four items that we've

32:44.780 --> 32:50.780
come to know as the items that were in the trunk that Jon Peters brought to his home

32:50.780 --> 32:58.100
from the green box over at, I want to say, A Plus Storage was the name, and those four

32:58.100 --> 33:03.500
items were the gun, the helmet, the radio, and the camera.

33:03.500 --> 33:11.540
And you found scientific math that did not quite add up to come up with the engineering

33:11.540 --> 33:13.580
to make those items possible.

33:13.580 --> 33:21.140
You also found some notes about different spells this person was trying out in an attempt

33:21.140 --> 33:31.460
at eternal life, and then you finally found twenty-five attempts at making a manipulating

33:31.460 --> 33:41.700
activator colon robot, A through Y, with the final one being codename Mary saw the picture

33:41.700 --> 33:48.340
of a small metal sphere that was one inch in diameter, and at the bottom it said host

33:48.340 --> 33:50.500
found.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.580
And yes, I was excited.

33:52.580 --> 34:00.540
You tried out one of these spells for the eternal life situation, you gave it a go,

34:00.540 --> 34:06.620
and when you said the words enough times, or maybe the right way, or maybe with the

34:06.620 --> 34:13.460
correct pronunciation, your bones began to vibrate, and then you felt all of your toenails

34:13.460 --> 34:21.180
and fingernails popping like popcorn off of your body, and at that exact moment, you heard

34:21.180 --> 34:27.660
the blast door that was on the far side of this room, something rammed itself.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.860
Probably something spooky.

34:29.860 --> 34:30.860
Might be a dragon.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.860
Look at my new name.

34:31.860 --> 34:32.860
I don't get it.

34:32.860 --> 34:34.460
Because it doesn't have nails.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.460
No nails required.

34:35.980 --> 34:36.980
Oh my god.

34:36.980 --> 34:41.140
It says dovetail joint, and I'm not a craftsman.

34:44.180 --> 34:49.060
Okay, so, when I look at my hand, like, what's that look like?

34:49.060 --> 34:56.460
Well, it looks like a hand, but instead of nails, there is a wrinkly bed of skin.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.980
So the nails popped like popcorn and fell off?

34:59.980 --> 35:00.980
Yes.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.740
If I touch them on the ground, are they still like nails?

35:03.740 --> 35:04.740
They're brittle.

35:05.620 --> 35:07.460
I put one in my pocket.

35:07.460 --> 35:08.980
I put all of them in my pocket.

35:08.980 --> 35:13.580
Okay, as you're collecting them, they are brittle like cat's nails.

35:13.580 --> 35:15.580
They're like ogres.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.580
They're like ogres?

35:16.580 --> 35:17.900
Yeah, they have layers.

35:17.900 --> 35:25.060
So as they kind of splinter apart as you're touching them, they're like extremely weak

35:25.060 --> 35:26.060
nails.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.060
Okay.

35:27.060 --> 35:28.420
I've got ten of those in my pocket.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.940
Okay, so probably a hundred shards.

35:31.020 --> 35:36.260
Okay, I want to take my shoes off and empty the nails out of there, and then put my shoes

35:36.260 --> 35:37.260
back on.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.260
What was your foot situation?

35:38.260 --> 35:39.780
Did you have on boat shoes?

35:39.780 --> 35:41.060
Yes, I did.

35:41.060 --> 35:42.060
So no socks.

35:42.060 --> 35:45.260
These were all just in your smelly smelly.

35:45.260 --> 35:46.260
And they stink.

35:46.260 --> 35:47.260
They stink.

35:47.260 --> 35:50.460
Also, remember, I fell into- no, no, no!

35:50.460 --> 35:51.460
I took my shoes off.

35:51.460 --> 35:52.460
Oh yeah, you took them off.

35:52.460 --> 35:59.260
So looking on the ground, you can look back and see the trail of muddy footprints, and

35:59.260 --> 36:04.900
you're not quite sure whether it's all mud on those footprints on the concrete ground,

36:04.900 --> 36:05.900
but you see these shards.

36:05.900 --> 36:08.200
I'm going to put my toenails in my pockets too.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.060
So you've got roughly 200 shards of nail.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.060
In that left pocket.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.340
In only the left pocket.

36:13.340 --> 36:14.700
Left cargo pocket.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.820
Like in the button up one.

36:16.820 --> 36:20.420
You remember those Halloween games when you were a kid where they'd have you put your

36:20.420 --> 36:21.420
hand into a bowl?

36:21.420 --> 36:23.420
Like spaghetti and grapes.

36:24.140 --> 36:30.460
Yeah, imagine what it would be like to put your hand into just 200 shards of brittle

36:30.460 --> 36:31.460
nail.

36:31.460 --> 36:32.460
No, thank you.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.180
I almost just threw up saying that.

36:37.180 --> 36:41.900
Okay, so now that I've got that done, I'm going to clean up.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.060
Another slam into this door.

36:44.060 --> 36:48.460
Do I physically feel any different other than not having nails?

36:48.460 --> 36:51.580
God, it's an emptiness?

36:51.580 --> 36:57.420
It's for sure emptiness, but it feels infinite in its helpfulness.

36:57.420 --> 37:01.100
Okay, am I still bleeding out of my bullet wounds?

37:01.100 --> 37:02.100
Yes, very much so.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.100
Okay.

37:03.100 --> 37:07.760
I'm going to peer through the window on this blast door and see what's making the commotion.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.620
As you're peering through this circular...

37:09.620 --> 37:12.220
What are those called?

37:12.220 --> 37:14.980
Circle window.

37:14.980 --> 37:15.980
Like a porthole?

37:15.980 --> 37:16.980
And a sub-mer...

37:16.980 --> 37:17.980
Yes, thank you.

37:17.980 --> 37:22.260
So you're looking through this essentially porthole on this blast door.

37:22.260 --> 37:28.220
The lights in this cavernous room shine down at just the perfect angle to illuminate a

37:28.220 --> 37:35.340
small circle of the floor of whatever room is behind this blast door, which is otherwise

37:35.340 --> 37:38.860
drenched in perfect darkness.

37:38.860 --> 37:49.980
And in this well-lit ring, you can see the grayish, withering, nail-free feet of a human.

37:49.980 --> 37:56.940
Immediately this creature rushes the door once more, and it smushes its face against

37:56.940 --> 37:58.940
the glass.

37:58.940 --> 38:06.860
Staring at you with wild eyes is the skeletal, pallid face of a teenage girl.

38:06.860 --> 38:09.820
Her skin is thin and decaying.

38:09.820 --> 38:18.020
Small tears have opened up sores on her cheekbones, nose, and chin, where bone is peeking out

38:18.020 --> 38:20.740
under infected lesions.

38:20.740 --> 38:27.780
Her scalp looks the same, where it isn't covered by patches of this thin, brittle hair.

38:27.780 --> 38:36.620
But still, enough of her is there to recognize Tildi B. Mitchell.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.140
No fucking way.

38:40.140 --> 38:44.940
And when she makes eye contact with you, she shrieks.

38:44.940 --> 38:51.420
I gotta get her out of there.

38:51.420 --> 38:55.900
Gonna help her.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.460
I'm terrified.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.460
Roll Sanity.

39:00.460 --> 39:05.420
39 on, I'm sure I have less than that.

39:05.420 --> 39:06.420
7.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.420
I wouldn't roll a d4.

39:08.420 --> 39:09.420
3.

39:09.420 --> 39:15.740
You stumble backwards, and you fall to the ground, and a panel in the concrete right

39:15.740 --> 39:19.980
next to you begins to kind of pshhh.

39:19.980 --> 39:23.060
And this square in the concrete kind of opens up.

39:23.060 --> 39:28.220
It's weird, you get the innate feeling that your watch was close enough to the ground

39:28.220 --> 39:29.620
in this exact spot.

39:29.620 --> 39:34.980
And as this panel lifts up out of the ground, it seems like you can remove a square of the

39:34.980 --> 39:39.540
concrete in the ground a foot down.

39:39.540 --> 39:46.700
There is a revolver, an old timey revolver, with weird, odd metal all over it, and these

39:46.700 --> 39:51.780
glass tubes, and it's got a green light that's lit.

39:51.780 --> 39:54.180
I wanna reach in and grab it.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.300
Is there anything else in that hole?

39:55.300 --> 39:56.300
No there is not.

39:56.300 --> 40:03.940
Okay, I'm gonna put it down on the ground very carefully, as to not break any tubes.

40:03.940 --> 40:10.460
And I want to, in this whole room, I'm gonna just walk around with my watch, like an inch

40:10.460 --> 40:13.260
from the ground, to see if anything else opens up.

40:13.260 --> 40:14.900
Ooh, okay, fun!

40:14.900 --> 40:15.900
Yeah.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.900
Go ahead and roll.

40:18.900 --> 40:19.900
Roll on natural.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.900
What do I have in there?

40:21.900 --> 40:22.900
50.

40:22.900 --> 40:26.660
Now he's showing me, he's showing me what he rolled on the camera.

40:26.660 --> 40:28.580
He rolled a 50 on a 50.

40:28.580 --> 40:29.580
Hell yeah.

40:29.580 --> 40:30.580
You motherfucker.

40:30.580 --> 40:31.580
Okay, absolutely.

40:31.580 --> 40:32.580
Abso-fucking-lutely.

40:33.500 --> 40:38.460
When you go, and you're like, basically, you're that dude on the beach.

40:38.460 --> 40:39.460
Gotta find some quarters.

40:39.460 --> 40:42.820
Just trying to find some quarters, baby, and hopefully they're from the right year.

40:42.820 --> 40:43.820
You know?

40:43.820 --> 40:44.820
Yeah.

40:44.820 --> 40:45.820
2019.

40:45.820 --> 40:49.340
Oh, those 2019 quarters are super rare.

40:49.340 --> 40:50.340
Yep.

40:50.340 --> 40:54.140
The newest, the newer the coin, the better they are.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.260
2020 would be a real find.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.740
I don't think they exist.

40:57.740 --> 41:00.820
Well, that's why it would be so rare.

41:01.820 --> 41:10.260
And another concrete square, about a foot by a foot, opens up out of the ground and

41:10.260 --> 41:18.060
looking down into this spot, you see a single metal sphere, about one inch in diameter.

41:18.060 --> 41:22.420
Ooh, I don't know if I want to touch it or not.

41:22.420 --> 41:24.420
Um, hmm.

41:24.420 --> 41:27.180
I want to check and make sure I still have my photo on me.

41:27.220 --> 41:33.620
When you look at the photograph that you have in your pocket, it is still your face as Silas

41:33.620 --> 41:34.620
Cole.

41:34.620 --> 41:35.620
Okay.

41:35.620 --> 41:38.980
What were the words on that piece of paper that was her face wrapped?

41:38.980 --> 41:40.220
Roll intelligence.

41:40.220 --> 41:45.220
I think one, a couple episodes ago, I remembered it, but I'll roll again.

41:45.220 --> 41:48.060
Yeah, if you don't remember, then you have to roll.

41:48.060 --> 41:53.020
Forty-four on a fifty.

41:53.020 --> 41:54.500
Hell yeah.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.660
You're just a, just to make sure, you know?

41:56.660 --> 41:58.140
I trust you.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.140
I like doing it though.

41:59.140 --> 42:00.140
Yeah, it's fun.

42:00.140 --> 42:01.140
It is fun.

42:01.140 --> 42:02.140
Show me what you got.

42:02.140 --> 42:07.940
I look at the photo and I'm like, hmm, oh yeah, those words, I remember exactly what

42:07.940 --> 42:09.100
they are there.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.780
Because you wrote them, you pulled out a Sharpie and you wrote them on the back of the picture.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.980
I wrote it on the back of the picture.

42:13.980 --> 42:18.900
And then I also wrote, this is Keith Bean's picture, don't steal it.

42:18.900 --> 42:25.300
It says, ianaha fersat sayiya.

42:25.300 --> 42:28.460
When I think of those words, how do I feel?

42:28.460 --> 42:29.460
Any different?

42:29.460 --> 42:30.460
Nope.

42:30.460 --> 42:36.180
Keith thinks up for a second, he's like, well, we've already chanted something weird today,

42:36.180 --> 42:46.700
so ianaha fersat sayiya, ianaha fersat sayiya, ianaha fersat sayiya.

42:46.700 --> 42:49.780
Roll just a check against fifty.

42:49.780 --> 42:54.340
Ooh, sixty-four on a fifty, so I fail.

42:54.340 --> 42:59.160
So that means I get to choose what it does.

42:59.160 --> 43:03.740
This spell had basically a mechanic where I didn't know that you were going to go bat

43:03.740 --> 43:08.100
shit crazy and fuck up Mildred Mitchell.

43:08.100 --> 43:14.960
And I made this spell where all four of us had a twenty-five percent chance of being

43:14.960 --> 43:20.020
the one who got to come up with what the spell does.

43:20.020 --> 43:25.100
But since it's only me and you here, I just have you roll basically a fifty-fifty shot

43:25.100 --> 43:27.980
to decide who gets to choose what the spell does.

43:27.980 --> 43:28.980
And I get to choose.

43:28.980 --> 43:30.820
It can only be three words.

43:30.820 --> 43:33.100
What the spell does can only be three words.

43:33.100 --> 43:34.100
Yeah.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.040
Makes brain smart.

43:36.040 --> 43:39.760
Oh boy, okay.

43:39.760 --> 43:44.380
Don't say penis falls off, oops.

43:44.380 --> 43:47.660
I prayed for that one before I lost my fingernails.

43:47.660 --> 43:49.500
You did indeed.

43:49.500 --> 43:54.540
There's lots of combinations of three words you could make.

43:54.540 --> 43:55.540
Okay.

43:55.540 --> 43:56.540
I'm nervous.

43:56.540 --> 44:04.300
As you begin to chant, you feel your bones once again begin to vibrate, but Keith Beans

44:04.300 --> 44:06.180
is more than bone.

44:06.180 --> 44:13.820
Keith Beans is partially made of metal, and all of that metal begins to heat up.

44:13.820 --> 44:21.900
You can feel it inside you throbbing with pain right before your skin begins splitting

44:21.900 --> 44:22.920
open.

44:22.920 --> 44:33.740
It starts at your index finger and your body slowly begins to unzip the rip peeling apart

44:33.740 --> 44:40.460
and the seam shooting up your forearm past your elbow, continuing toward your shoulder

44:40.460 --> 44:49.820
as the metal inside this arm begins falling out and clanking on the concrete floor below.

44:49.820 --> 44:57.360
The opening of your body does not cease, however, and your skin continues to burst open, unzipping

44:57.360 --> 45:05.060
itself up your neck, and it finally halts its progress at the tear duct of the eye.

45:05.060 --> 45:10.540
The glass scientists had to surgically set back into its socket.

45:10.540 --> 45:14.780
The pain is searing and unbearable.

45:14.780 --> 45:23.140
Your metal septum shifts to one side and slides out of your nostril.

45:23.140 --> 45:30.860
An endless stream of cocaine pours onto the ground, forming an anthill mound of white

45:30.860 --> 45:34.100
powder on the uneven concrete.

45:34.140 --> 45:46.260
Half of your upper body is an empty, slashed-open skin seam, and with that, the real pain begins.

45:46.260 --> 45:51.860
Bones begin cracking and forming.

45:51.860 --> 45:54.780
The bone and muscle starts growing.

45:54.780 --> 46:00.780
Your nerve endings are lighting up like the finale of a fireworks show, this torrid pain

46:00.780 --> 46:07.500
taking away your breath, your body is covered in sweat, and you feel like this horror will

46:07.500 --> 46:16.860
never end, but finally, your skin begins zipping itself back up, and when it's finished, you

46:16.860 --> 46:19.620
can't even find the seam.

46:19.620 --> 46:28.420
The only evidence of what you just lived through is the pile of cocaine and metal skeletal

46:28.420 --> 46:34.700
structures strewn about on the ground below you.

46:34.700 --> 46:35.700
Does it still hurt?

46:35.700 --> 46:37.500
It hurts like a motherfucker.

46:37.500 --> 46:42.020
Well, I don't think Keith could have pulled off the one-armed Voldemort look, so I'm glad

46:42.020 --> 46:45.300
it came back at least.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.040
Keith is freaking the fuck out.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.460
How long does this process take?

46:49.460 --> 46:52.100
It takes, what, ten minutes?

46:52.100 --> 46:54.140
So what are you doing while this is happening?

46:54.140 --> 46:55.820
Are you just standing there letting it happen?

46:55.820 --> 46:57.460
Are you walking around?

46:57.460 --> 46:58.460
Are you falling over?

46:58.460 --> 47:04.820
I'm like just staring at my arm and like, yeah, just like in shock, staring at my arm

47:04.820 --> 47:08.700
and like feeling my nose and trying to keep it together.

47:08.700 --> 47:15.620
And the spell has completed its intended purpose, as you are made whole again.

47:15.620 --> 47:17.060
And I need you to roll sanity.

47:17.060 --> 47:20.660
Yeah, I'm gonna fail that unless it's a miracle.

47:20.660 --> 47:24.620
Okay, I have a 4% chance of this being a good roll.

47:24.620 --> 47:26.580
Oh, I bet you can do it.

47:27.100 --> 47:28.100
Nah.

47:28.100 --> 47:29.100
87.

47:29.100 --> 47:30.100
Okay.

47:30.100 --> 47:31.100
Oh, 57.

47:31.100 --> 47:32.100
Still a fail.

47:32.100 --> 47:37.340
Uh, go ahead and, uh, what do you think?

47:37.340 --> 47:38.340
Roll a d4 for me.

47:38.340 --> 47:41.260
Okay, I hope that- Your body just fell out of itself and then

47:41.260 --> 47:45.820
reformed with human bone- Hope that I don't roll a 4 on this bad boy.

47:45.820 --> 47:46.820
You won't.

47:46.820 --> 47:47.820
There's no way.

47:47.820 --> 47:48.820
Fucking shit.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.820
No shit.

47:49.820 --> 47:53.820
He's showing me the- He rolled a 4?

47:54.820 --> 47:59.060
Oh, Keith Beans.

47:59.060 --> 48:00.740
I don't feel very good.

48:00.740 --> 48:06.060
As you hit zero sanity, according to the rules of the game that we definitely always follow

48:06.060 --> 48:08.020
to a T- To the T.

48:08.020 --> 48:10.820
The handler gets to take over control.

48:10.820 --> 48:12.300
Spill the T, baby.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.700
Don't mind if I do.

48:13.700 --> 48:19.380
Keith Beans, in his newly formed body, walks over to the workstation across this cavernous

48:19.380 --> 48:20.740
laboratory.

48:20.740 --> 48:25.700
She stuffs as many of the blueprints and notes as he possibly can into the big ol' cargo

48:25.700 --> 48:32.260
short pockets, along with his stash of nail shards, before he sets his eyes on the gun

48:32.260 --> 48:37.980
he so carefully placed on the ground to avoid cracking those glass tubes.

48:37.980 --> 48:46.180
Those glass tubes which he can now see are full of this undulating pitch black ooze.

48:46.180 --> 48:52.540
And Keith picks up this odd looking revolver, eagerly considering the lit green light on

48:52.540 --> 49:00.580
the side, which is next to this cylinder, which he slides open, revealing a single oversized

49:00.580 --> 49:04.660
bullet that fills the entire chamber.

49:04.660 --> 49:12.460
This bullet looks old and dusty, and Keith smiles as he resets the cylinder and pulls

49:12.460 --> 49:14.660
back the hammer.

49:14.660 --> 49:23.660
With a squeeze of the trigger comes a blinding flash of light, and Keith Beans finds himself

49:23.660 --> 49:28.660
standing on a dirty, sandy trail.

49:28.660 --> 49:34.220
The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air, and looking down the

49:34.220 --> 49:40.720
road, Keith sees a man just a bit ahead of him walking into town.

49:40.720 --> 49:46.860
The camera pans down just in time as Keith Beans strips his shorts off.

49:46.860 --> 49:52.120
We steadily move forward over the shit and mud covered shorts and the dusty footpath

49:52.120 --> 49:59.680
and words appear at the bottom of the screen in an old western font that reads,

49:59.680 --> 50:03.840
Contention 1880 something.

50:03.840 --> 50:10.680
As the camera pans back up there in the distance we see a fully naked Keith Beans sprinting

50:10.680 --> 50:12.680
toward his target.

50:12.680 --> 50:19.840
He hollers out, Hey, Silas Cole, and the man turns around just in time for a sucker punch.

50:19.840 --> 50:25.740
As soon as Cole hits the ground, Keith grabs his chin in the back of his neck and extinguishes

50:25.740 --> 50:30.560
this man's life with a single twist.

50:30.560 --> 50:39.480
Keith is standing over this man's body now, which is face down in the dry, cracked dirt.

50:39.480 --> 50:43.120
Face down in the dirt.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.680
And this dead body says it doesn't hurt.

50:45.680 --> 50:51.160
One day, one job, bad bad, and enough.

50:51.160 --> 50:59.400
Yep, guys, if you haven't checked out Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, I'm telling you, top tier,

50:59.400 --> 51:01.800
top tier shit.

51:01.800 --> 51:08.640
Back to the body on the ground, Keith's hands are trembling as he rolls Silas over a dead

51:08.640 --> 51:16.360
man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine, dressed in the fashion of the day, and a tri-folded

51:16.360 --> 51:21.600
piece of parchment falls out of this deceased man's jacket pocket.

51:21.600 --> 51:27.760
It's a job advertisement for the Contention Mining Company, and it reads,

51:27.760 --> 51:33.520
We is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.160
Plenty of work.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.880
Hesitate not.

51:36.880 --> 51:37.880
Whew!

51:37.880 --> 51:41.400
What the hell's gonna happen?

51:41.400 --> 51:43.400
Fuck yeah.

51:43.400 --> 51:52.640
I'm fucking insane, and in the past, I'm gonna fuck some shit up.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.480
It's my town now.

52:05.160 --> 52:31.480
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

52:31.480 --> 52:42.280
How can you have enough drowning out all the noise?

52:42.280 --> 52:46.280
There's nobody home.

52:46.280 --> 52:54.280
Nobody home.

52:54.280 --> 52:58.280
Fight, fight, streamy night.
