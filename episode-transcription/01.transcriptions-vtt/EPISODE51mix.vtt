00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Greetings, listeners, this is an introduction of myself, Wolf the dog, and this introduction

00:07.600 --> 00:14.940
is introducing itself as hard as it can, live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:14.940 --> 00:20.340
Speaking of meet and greets, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week, ain't that special.

00:20.340 --> 00:27.780
It goes, hey there, Crystal, yes, you, coat rack, just keep working and act normal, they'll

00:27.780 --> 00:34.560
know we're talking, they're always watching, where do you think the glowing flamingo really

00:34.560 --> 00:41.420
came from, the kitchen light flashes and cold but I've started to crack it, we'll talk soon,

00:41.420 --> 00:47.820
see you in the car, from Millhouse, hmm, this seems like a message that may not have been

00:47.820 --> 00:54.640
meant for y'alls truly, but y'all, I think the postal service is a lie, so I always open

00:54.640 --> 01:01.600
up anyone's mail I see, it's like I have access to infinite gifts year round, it's

01:01.600 --> 01:07.500
always someone's birthday somewhere and I'm usually in that someone's dumpster when the

01:07.500 --> 01:15.520
mailman goes walking by, happy birthday to me, baby, glowing flamingo do sound pretty

01:15.520 --> 01:20.520

01:50.360 --> 01:56.680
The most recent one is the recently unearthed recording of session zero for this whole damn

01:56.680 --> 02:02.680
campaign in which the town of contention is created and the cast discusses their plans

02:02.680 --> 02:08.720
for the podcast, well, everybody makes plans, but only what actually happens becomes the

02:08.720 --> 02:10.320
news.

02:10.320 --> 02:18.000
As of right before sundown, Liz Lonklin had spoken with a strange rambling man in a clearing

02:18.000 --> 02:24.860
surrounded by sigils in a circle of a white powder before she ran into Ash Hornbeam, arm

02:24.860 --> 02:31.000
still stuck in the tree, coming up with no solution, Ash freaked out and pulled his arm

02:31.000 --> 02:36.440
halfway out, his extreme pain tolerance the only thing keeping him conscious.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.600
Liz bailed to go look for help and she found Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff with

02:41.600 --> 02:48.120
a naked, bloody, muddy man tied to a tree, Jeremy was feeding him sausage toe beans in

02:48.120 --> 02:54.920
an attempt to calm his new friend he called Rusty, Ken was not on board with this situation.

02:54.920 --> 03:01.040
Judy Krenkelhoff ran off into the woods after losing her shit and calling Shadow a tree,

03:01.040 --> 03:07.240
the two of them almost fell into a pit trap but instead found a rather gregarious raccoon

03:07.240 --> 03:13.680
that charade style told them to avoid the hand sanitizer and to all get the absolute

03:13.680 --> 03:19.760
fuck out of the woods, the three of them walked back to the trailhead where they found Krista

03:19.760 --> 03:25.200
Krenkelhoff in the ranger's shack, she gave Judy more hand sanitizer before the three

03:25.200 --> 03:31.200
came to the conclusion that the best next course of action is for Krista and Shadow

03:31.200 --> 03:36.920
to go back into the woods to find Liz while Judy stays at the ranger's shack with the

03:36.920 --> 03:44.200
raccoon and then Judy Krenkelhoff opened the door to the bathroom and she learned exactly

03:44.200 --> 03:51.200
why it is blue false indigo with moon dance, she runs, the sun is sleeping soon, she knows

04:14.200 --> 04:30.200
she knows she knows that the time has come to dance beneath the dance beneath the shadow

04:30.200 --> 04:45.200
of the moon.

04:45.200 --> 04:50.440
You guys are walking through the woods looking for Ash Hornbeam who Liz has told you has

04:50.440 --> 04:58.600
his arm stuck in a tree and the sun goes down behind the trees of the woods and you are

04:58.600 --> 05:06.200
now walking through total darkness, you are not on the path of the trail any longer because

05:06.200 --> 05:12.820
that is not where Ash Hornbeam resides in the mind of Liz Lonklin and as you're walking

05:12.820 --> 05:19.920
through you all begin to realize that you have no fucking clue where you are or where

05:19.920 --> 05:23.960
you're going.

05:23.960 --> 05:30.440
Rusty no, Rusty, you eat smokies but don't bite the fingers, leave my fingers alone.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.480
He's looking at your fingers and like doing that thing where he wraps his lips around

05:34.480 --> 05:41.800
your fingertips like a horse might looking for a carrot, see I feed him palm down from

05:41.800 --> 05:48.880
now on, palm up like you do a horse and then he immediately like looks over at Ken Krenkelhoff

05:48.880 --> 05:58.360
and like yeah, he's being a turd, huh?

05:58.360 --> 06:02.600
I pick up my pace ahead of that.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.200
Liz you said he was this way, where is he?

06:05.200 --> 06:09.900
I don't know, I swear to god he was just over here like just over around this corner.

06:09.900 --> 06:15.960
And as you guys pass that corner you see that amongst these trees you can make it out in

06:15.960 --> 06:22.240
the moonlight, it happens to be not a full moon but like so close to a full moon that

06:22.240 --> 06:26.040
you might be like that's a full moon but then you look it up and you're like it wasn't a

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
full moon.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.040
Yeah it's just waning.

06:28.040 --> 06:32.280
Does this ever happen to you where you think it's a full moon and you say oh that's a full

06:32.280 --> 06:35.840
moon and someone corrects you because they know when the full moon is?

06:35.840 --> 06:39.520
No but I correct people because you can just fucking look and see when it's a circle or

06:39.520 --> 06:40.520
not.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.720
Sometimes it's really close to a circle.

06:44.720 --> 06:52.120
So this moonlight is shining down and ahead of you you see glinting from the moonlight

06:52.120 --> 06:58.360
is a frame like of a painting and it's hanging from a tree.

06:58.360 --> 07:02.400
Let's just turn around y'all, fuck that.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.320
What if we just went the other way immediately?

07:05.320 --> 07:10.960
And with that I'm gonna need Thomas and Lindsay to leave the room.

07:14.720 --> 07:23.920
Hey Joe.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.360
Hey Zach.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.480
We're gonna cut to a quick flashback here.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.560
Oh boy.

07:32.560 --> 07:40.280
It's a couple years ago and it also happens to be the evening that Kane Krinklehoff, Ash

07:40.280 --> 07:44.660
Hornbeam, and Jeremy Pettymore are out in the woods.

07:44.660 --> 07:46.340
Looking for Madge.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.860
Simpler happier times.

07:47.860 --> 07:48.860
Of course.

07:48.860 --> 07:52.460
You actually felt one when you were with him.

07:52.460 --> 07:56.220
They were, they're my buds.

07:56.220 --> 08:02.340
The look in your eyes when you say that is so like nostalgia killing.

08:02.340 --> 08:09.580
Kane Krinklehoff pops away to go pee, finds a spot in the woods, behind a tree, something

08:09.580 --> 08:11.060
else that rhymes.

08:12.020 --> 08:21.340
As you're looking up from your stream of urine, you see the frame of a painting hanging in

08:21.340 --> 08:23.980
the woods.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.620
Can I make out what is within the frame?

08:26.620 --> 08:27.820
How far away is it from me?

08:27.820 --> 08:34.660
It's about 25 yards away from you and you can see that it looks as if there is nothing

08:34.660 --> 08:35.900
within the frame.

08:35.900 --> 08:39.180
You see the trees on the other side.

08:39.220 --> 08:45.740
I'm going to approach it a little bit, that's weird, who put a frame out here in the woods?

08:45.740 --> 08:48.380
Go ahead and roll alertness for me.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.700
I pass a 27 on a 50.

08:56.700 --> 09:03.300
Kane Krinklehoff notices that somewhere around the edge of the frame, something doesn't line

09:03.300 --> 09:04.300
up.

09:04.420 --> 09:09.020
It looks almost as if what's behind this frame that's hanging isn't the same as what you

09:09.020 --> 09:10.340
can see through it.

09:10.340 --> 09:17.780
And so you move to the side and you walk, you strafe, is that how you say that word?

09:17.780 --> 09:18.780
You straffy.

09:18.780 --> 09:26.820
When I was a kid, I always said straffy because I didn't, I didn't, I was a fucking idiot.

09:26.820 --> 09:38.060
You slam and as you walk to the side, you see that beyond this frame is a cabin sitting

09:38.060 --> 09:40.020
in the woods.

09:40.020 --> 09:43.720
Ken wants to push his hand through the frame, can he?

09:43.720 --> 09:46.580
Go ahead and roll a survival check for me.

09:46.580 --> 09:50.060
Oh fuck, that's a fatal mistake.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.060
What's your survival?

09:51.060 --> 09:52.060
A 50.

09:52.060 --> 09:55.620
I pass a 24 on a 50.

09:55.620 --> 10:04.220
As you approach the frame, you make a misstep and your foot is about to land on a wire.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.720
There's a wire that is going across the ground that's right in front of the frame and you

10:08.720 --> 10:14.100
almost step right on it and you see it's connected to like a stake in the ground and then it

10:14.100 --> 10:16.820
goes off to a tree and ties off.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.060
Oh shit.

10:18.060 --> 10:22.340
Okay, I want to abort my mission of the hand through the painting and I want to step back

10:22.340 --> 10:27.540
and grab a branch or a rock, anything that's nearby and try and toss it in from where I'm

10:27.540 --> 10:28.540
standing.

10:28.540 --> 10:35.940
You toss it onto the wire and a giant wooden spear comes flying through the canvas of this

10:35.940 --> 10:42.420
painting and strikes directly into a tree that is five feet away from you and you think

10:42.420 --> 10:46.900
if you would have been standing there when you stepped on this wire, you would have gotten

10:46.900 --> 10:52.140
a face full of splinters and probably a back of the head full of splinters as well.

10:52.140 --> 10:56.080
And it came out of the frame, like I couldn't tell where it came from.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.940
You couldn't, but it busted through the frame.

10:58.940 --> 11:02.340
Go ahead and roll a retroactive sanity.

11:02.340 --> 11:03.340
Yeah.

11:03.340 --> 11:11.260
I fail a 78 on a 34.

11:11.260 --> 11:14.960
What's going through your mind as you race back to your campsite?

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
It can't be real.

11:15.960 --> 11:16.960
It can't be real.

11:16.960 --> 11:22.480
I've just not gotten enough sleep tonight and it doesn't exist.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.100
Jeremy Pettymore, Liz Lonklin, and Ken Krenkelhoff.

11:45.100 --> 11:53.100
As well as this large, bloody, muddy man who is at the end of Jeremy Pettymore's rope.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.100
Rusty.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.100
Rusty.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.100
I'm so sorry.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.100
Rusty.

11:57.100 --> 12:03.540
Are all standing in this clearing looking at this frame that is glinting in the moonlight.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.540
Jeremy!

12:04.540 --> 12:05.540
Elizabeth stop!

12:05.540 --> 12:06.540
Yeah, don't stop.

12:06.540 --> 12:07.540
Okay.

12:07.540 --> 12:08.540
Don't.

12:08.540 --> 12:09.540
Go.

12:09.540 --> 12:10.540
Near it.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.540
You recognize that frame?

12:11.980 --> 12:15.020
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't think it was real.

12:15.020 --> 12:21.300
I didn't think it was, I just thought I was, just hadn't had enough sleep that night.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.520
It's, look, and I point at the thing on the ground.

12:25.520 --> 12:32.300
Looking down where Ken Krenkelhoff is pointing, you see that right before this frame that's

12:32.300 --> 12:38.840
hanging there is a trip wire on the ground tied to a stake in the ground and the other

12:38.840 --> 12:41.900
end of the wire goes to a tree that is nearby.

12:41.900 --> 12:47.360
So they wanted to distract us with the frame and trip us up with the wire.

12:47.360 --> 12:48.360
Stand back, stand back.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.920
And I push them where I know it is a safe place.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.320
Rusty, come here boy, come on.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.680
And I go ahead and throw a log and show them.

12:55.680 --> 13:04.160
When Ken Krenkelhoff throws a small log onto this trip wire, a long wooden spear flies

13:04.160 --> 13:11.200
through the canvas of the frame and directly into a tree 10 feet away from you guys.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.080
Whoa, that was cool.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.600
Holy shit.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.600
That was awesome, Ken.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.360
How'd you know it would do that?

13:19.360 --> 13:28.200
I, a couple of years ago, I was, I had to pee and I came over here to pee and I saw,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.520
I saw it then.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
I didn't think it was real.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.280
I didn't, I didn't, I just pushed it out of my memory.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.680
I didn't, but it's real.

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
It's there.

13:37.680 --> 13:38.680
You guys see it, right?

13:38.680 --> 13:44.560
The painting, the frame there where the giant spear came through the canvas.

13:44.560 --> 13:51.240
You now see there's a cabin in the woods on the other side of the frame.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.240
Oh my God, Zach.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.240
That's already a movie.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.240
I think it's a lot of movies.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.240
Did you not know?

13:56.240 --> 13:58.560
Zach, that's a name of a literal movie.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.560
Wait, what?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
There's a movie called.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.600
Fucking beautiful idiot.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
Cabin in the woods.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
That's a very popular movie.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.600
Are there any eldritch gods in it?

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
I think so, yeah.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
Actually, kind of.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
Oh, fuck.

14:08.600 --> 14:11.400
I think that's like the whole deal.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.800
If you want to start over, we can.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.800
Let's just go back.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.800
This is so embarrassing for you.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.120
Do you guys want to make middle schoolers this time?

14:17.120 --> 14:18.120
Sure.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.120
Yes.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.120
You'd like that.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.120
Gah, again?

14:21.120 --> 14:25.920
Oh, it's super cool when you do that.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.040
It makes me feel good.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.040
No, it makes me feel good.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.040
Oh.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.040
Got him.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
FBI.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.040
Come on, inside.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.040
Got him.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.040
Ew.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.040
Busting makes me feel good.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.040
Busting makes me feel good.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
Oh, that was good.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.040
Busting makes me feel good.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.040
Sorry.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.040
All together now.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.040
Busting makes me feel good.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
It's all about ghosts now.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.040
It's middle schoolers and ghosts.

14:56.040 --> 15:01.200
Hey, Jeremy Pettymore, how do you feel about the fact that Ken saw something out in the

15:01.200 --> 15:04.560
woods a couple years ago and didn't say anything to you?

15:04.560 --> 15:08.040
Jeremy is probably just a little too excited by all this.

15:08.040 --> 15:14.040
And if he really processed it, he'd put one and two together and he'd be like, what the

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
fuck, man?

15:15.040 --> 15:19.040
But right now, he's very much in the moment.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.040
You're the treasure hunter who has found a chest at the bottom of a hole.

15:23.040 --> 15:26.040
Yeah, of course this woods is full of freaky frames.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
Freaky frames?

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
Cabins in the woods?

15:28.040 --> 15:32.040
I grab Jeremy, I grab him and kind of move him to show him that there's no cabin over

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
there.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
It's just when you look through here.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.040
Nope.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.040
Oh, that's not the case?

15:36.040 --> 15:40.040
When you look through on the other side this time, there is a cabin.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
Oh, that freaks Ken out.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.040
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
There's obviously a cabin there, dude.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.040
It wasn't there.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.040
It wasn't there.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.040
I fail hard.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.040
A 93 on a 34.

15:52.040 --> 15:57.040
Go ahead and roll a D6 for me.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
Oh, boy.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.040
Oh, boy.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
A five.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.040
Yeah.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.040
That's what I wanted to happen.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.040
So, you lose five sanity.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.040
Go down to 29.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
What the fuck?

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
Oh, we hit a lot, relatively.

16:11.040 --> 16:15.040
And we're playing a slightly different sanity mechanic for this game.

16:15.040 --> 16:21.040
It's come through a couple of times, maybe just once earlier, but you have not seen it.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
We're going to do bouts of insanity.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.040
Do you remember earlier in one of our other campaigns, maybe both of them, what I would

16:27.040 --> 16:31.040
have you do is rank fight, flight, and feint.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
Oh, yeah.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.040
From most likely to least likely for your character.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.040
So, which would be most likely?

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
Flight.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.040
And next would be?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.040
Fight.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.040
And the third would be?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.040
Feint.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.040
All right.

16:44.040 --> 16:49.040
So, if you roll a one, two, or three, you will flight.

16:49.040 --> 16:52.040
If you roll a four or a five, you will fight.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.040
And if you roll a six, you will feint.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
It's a four.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.040
That's a fight, baby.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.040
What?

17:00.040 --> 17:01.040
Oh, God.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.040
So, here's what I'm thinking.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.040
You just start punching that cabin.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
Yeah.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.040
Dump cabin.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.040
I don't know exactly what you look for in a fight response, but could I like maybe grab

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
the spear and be ready to fight?

17:13.040 --> 17:16.040
Like, I'm amped and stoked to be doing damage now.

17:16.040 --> 17:21.040
Not only are you going to grab the spear and be stoked to do damage now, but also flight

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
was going to be run away.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.040
So, fight is going to be run toward.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.040
We got to kill this cabin.

17:29.040 --> 17:33.040
And why do you hate some home so much?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
Someone built that with their hands.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.040
They lived there.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.040
They lived there for all we know.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.040
It didn't used to be there.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.040
Lindsey, what is Liz Conklin doing?

17:40.040 --> 17:45.040
Liz Lonklin, first of all, how dare you, is she's just confused.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.040
She's like, it's a cabin.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.040
Why is it that crazy that there's a cabin there?

17:49.040 --> 17:51.040
I'm sure that person that lives there put this frame there.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
I don't know.

17:52.040 --> 17:57.040
It just seems to me like somebody's being a douche who's trying to keep me from performing

17:57.040 --> 17:59.040
voodoo on the girl that I'm-

17:59.040 --> 18:01.040
Out here to perform voodoo on.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.040
Yeah.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.040
Damn, she has such a cooler reason for being in the woods than us.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
I'm just pissed.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.040
Why the fuck am I here with these fucking freshmen right now?

18:09.040 --> 18:14.040
It's just a spell written by Fufuzuzu Voodoo is a book they found in the library.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.040
Jeremy Pennymore, what are you doing?

18:16.040 --> 18:18.040
Ken, wait, hold up.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.040
Come on, Rusty.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
I follow after him.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
Can't stop, got to fight.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.040
Can't stop, got to fight might be your last words.

18:24.040 --> 18:29.040
Roll an alertness check at a negative 40 for being insane.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.040
I was going to say that there might be more traps, but I was running.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.040
Yeah, there might be.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.040
What am I rolling?

18:34.040 --> 18:36.040
Alertness at negative 40.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.040
At negative 40.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.040
For being absolutely out of your mind.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
Absolute fail.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
It's a 76.

18:42.040 --> 18:49.040
And you run directly into a pile of leaves on the ground that is not a pile of leaves

18:49.040 --> 18:50.040
on the ground.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.040
It's a motherfucking pit trap.

18:53.040 --> 19:02.040
And I need, once again, Thomas and Lindsay to leave the room.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
Don't worry, guys.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.040
I'm going to get out of it.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
Busting makes me feel good.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.040
Busting makes me feel good.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
Busting.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.040
You guys actually see him as he's running.

19:11.040 --> 19:17.040
You just fucking, he's on your level and then he's not anymore.

19:17.040 --> 19:35.040
Leaves papa behind.

19:35.040 --> 19:40.040
Ash Hornbeam, you're standing in the middle of the woods.

19:40.040 --> 19:48.040
No fucking clue direction wise where you are from anything in the contention woods.

19:48.040 --> 19:53.040
Your arm is halfway in the hollow of a tree.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
We figured it out.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
I looked it up while I was editing that episode.

19:57.040 --> 20:03.040
I looked it up literally like three days ago because I was like, what is a knot but not

20:03.040 --> 20:04.040
a knot?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.040
Not a knot.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
Well, I looked it up.

20:06.040 --> 20:13.040
It's a hollow and we both used the word hollow within 30 seconds of not knowing what it is.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.040
Okay.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
Well, perfect.

20:15.040 --> 20:20.040
Your arm is halfway into this hollow of this tree.

20:20.040 --> 20:29.040
The rest of your arm that you can see up to your elbow is muscle and a thin layer of membrane

20:29.040 --> 20:31.040
that is, what's it called?

20:31.040 --> 20:32.040
What's in between muscle?

20:32.040 --> 20:35.040
You were in nursing school for like four months.

20:35.040 --> 20:39.040
Well, between your, I mean, there's like layers of skin and then your muscle.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
What's that sin you called the white stuff?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.040
Aphasia.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
Aphasia.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.040
No.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.040
Fascia.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.040
F-A-C-I-A.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.040
F-A.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.040
Yeah.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.040
Fascia.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.040
Fascia.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.040
Fascia.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
Doesn't matter.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.040
Let's move on.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.040
It's not like that would have been ripped away.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.040
It would not be there.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.040
Like the brine of an orange or the pith.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.040
I mean, so.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.040
Oh yeah.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.040
Ew.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.040
Gross.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.040
You can see this juice.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.040
Think about that.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.040
This juice of your arm.

21:04.040 --> 21:09.040
Think about a blood orange that you didn't really take the peel off of very well.

21:09.040 --> 21:16.040
And the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance.

21:16.040 --> 21:21.040
And you are standing all alone in moonlight.

21:21.040 --> 21:25.040
I really don't know where to go from here.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.040
You hear a branch crack in the distance.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.040
Someone is nearby.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.040
I wait silently.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.040
What's bothering you is a man.

21:35.040 --> 21:40.040
He's wearing a black suit, a white shirt, and a bolo tie.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.040
He is in his late 20s, early 30s maybe.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.040
He has a very, very bitchin' mustache.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.040
He's pretty fit.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.040
His pants are a little too tight.

21:51.040 --> 21:56.040
And he flashes an FBI badge as he approaches.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.040
Name's Agent Kevin.

21:57.040 --> 22:02.040
I need you to tell me what you're up to with your arm stuck in this tree out here in the

22:02.040 --> 22:03.040
woods.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.040
Ash just looks down at his arm.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.040
A tear rolls out of his eye.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
Just help me.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.040
I'm here to help.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.040
I need a little bit of information before I can help you.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.040
My arm is stuck.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.040
Why?

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
Because I put it in here.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.040
Why can't you get it out?

22:19.040 --> 22:22.040
It feels like there's barbs in here.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.040
And the more I pull out, the more skin gets ripped off.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.040
I just, I don't know what to do.

22:29.040 --> 22:35.040
He pulls some cloth out of one of his pockets, and he wraps it around your arm, if you're

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
willing.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
Whatever you want to do.

22:37.040 --> 22:42.040
So he begins, he has some ointment that he puts on your arm, and then he wraps a cloth

22:42.040 --> 22:46.040
around it, and he's like, that should help start the bleeding for now a little bit, but

22:46.040 --> 22:47.040
I need some more information.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.040
What were you doing out here in the woods?

22:49.040 --> 22:51.040
You know there's people missing, right?

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
I know, I gotta...

22:52.040 --> 22:54.040
Why'd you decide to become one of them?

22:54.040 --> 23:02.040
It hurts me a little bit, but I kind of pull my arm away from the tree, and I let the light

23:02.040 --> 23:07.040
shine out, and I just point to it, and I look at him with wide eyes.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.040
Yeah, that's wild.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
That's not an answer, though.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.040
Why'd you come out to the woods, anyway, in the first place?

23:12.040 --> 23:21.040
Well, we come out here, me and a couple of friends, we come out here every year, and

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
we just camp.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.040
I was just trying to camp, but we found...

23:26.040 --> 23:28.040
You decided to camp when there were people missing in the woods?

23:28.040 --> 23:31.040
You decided to come out here and camp, anyway?

23:31.040 --> 23:32.040
Doesn't seem very smart.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.040
I'm in high school.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.040
I see that.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.040
I didn't think through...

23:37.040 --> 23:44.040
I wasn't going to stop camping every year if people are missing.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
I don't...

23:45.040 --> 23:46.040
I'm invincible.

23:46.040 --> 23:50.040
Roll a persuade.

23:50.040 --> 23:53.040
He's going to roll human against you.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.040
49 on a 50.

23:56.040 --> 24:00.040
I rolled a 69, which in our house rules is a critical success.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.040
Is a critical success.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.040
You're not telling me the whole truth, son.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.040
I can see it in your eyes.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.040
Something scared you.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.040
You knew about something like this before you came out here.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
What's your deal?

24:11.040 --> 24:13.040
We come out here every year to find something.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.040
We haven't found it yet, but...

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
What are you looking for?

24:16.040 --> 24:18.040
I don't know if I can tell you.

24:18.040 --> 24:24.040
You have to trust me or you're going to die tonight.

24:24.040 --> 24:28.040
Ash looks down at his arm and he sees the first aid, basically.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.040
Sure.

24:29.040 --> 24:35.040
What this guy has done to him and he looks up at the FBI.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.040
He says, I'm looking for Madge.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.040
Who's Madge?

24:38.040 --> 24:45.040
It's just a while back we heard about a woman in the woods and at first it was just kind

24:45.040 --> 24:51.040
of an excuse to come out and camp every year, but every year we started believing in it

24:51.040 --> 24:59.040
a little more and with all this stuff going on, I think I finally believe it.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.040
And we're out here looking for her.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.040
I got a couple friends.

25:04.040 --> 25:08.040
Two of my buddies are, I don't know where they are now.

25:08.040 --> 25:13.040
I don't know where I am, but I came with them.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.040
Alright, well...

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
Shit.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
Alright.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.040
Thank you.

25:24.040 --> 25:32.040
And he walks up behind you and you feel the metal of a gun up against the back of your head

25:32.040 --> 25:34.040
and his hand is trembling.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.040
An instinct kicks in.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.040
His left arm, which is...

25:38.040 --> 25:40.040
His right arm is in the tree.

25:40.040 --> 25:45.040
His left arm reaches into his pocket, pulls out a lighter and then he reaches in to his

25:45.040 --> 25:52.040
inside of his jacket, pulls out a handful of firecrackers and in one quick motion lights

25:52.040 --> 25:58.040
the lighter, lighting five or six firecrackers.

25:58.040 --> 26:04.040
He reaches behind him and he holds the firecrackers on this guy's head, knowing that his hand

26:04.040 --> 26:09.040
is going to get hurt, holds the lit firecrackers on this guy's head and waits for them to explode.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
Alright!

26:11.040 --> 26:18.040
I'm going to go ahead and roll some dice here to see what Agent Kevin decides to do.

26:18.040 --> 26:25.040
As soon as you do that, he pulls the gun back down, grabs the firecrackers in your hand

26:25.040 --> 26:32.040
and he throws them with your hand and then he stands up in front of you face to face.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.040
Alright, you're a fighter.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.040
We could actually use another set of hands.

26:36.040 --> 26:39.040
Well, I guess maybe just one will do.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.040
I'll be back.

26:40.040 --> 26:47.040
Ash kind of chuckles because he gets the little joke that this FBI agent made.

26:47.040 --> 26:52.040
He reaches back into his jacket and stares him in the eye.

26:52.040 --> 26:58.040
The tiny explosion happens from these fireworks that you guys have thrown off away from you

26:58.040 --> 27:02.040
and he turns back and looks at you with this wry smile.

27:02.040 --> 27:05.040
You look familiar.

27:05.040 --> 27:11.040
You're that kid from around here who had the troubles with them robbers, yeah?

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
Yeah, that's me.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.040
And you fought them off, didn't you?

27:15.040 --> 27:17.040
Oh yeah, real good.

27:17.040 --> 27:19.040
I knew you were a fighter.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
How'd you do that?

27:21.040 --> 27:26.040
I pulled a lot of pranks, kind of used my past knowledge of pranks that usually were harmless

27:26.040 --> 27:30.040
but I added a little element to them to do some harm.

27:30.040 --> 27:33.040
Yeah, we're going to need some thinking like that for tonight.

27:33.040 --> 27:36.040
Well, I'll come with you if you can get me out of this tree.

27:36.040 --> 27:39.040
And then we flash back into the history.

27:39.040 --> 27:47.040
The pages on the book turn backwards as this, you know, fluttering music happens behind us

27:47.040 --> 27:54.040
and we travel back into time when Ash Hornbeam is an even younger boy

27:54.040 --> 27:57.040
and we see the front of the Hornbeam home.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.040
What kind of house do the Hornbeams have?

27:59.040 --> 28:03.040
It's like a two story, just kind of like Victorian.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.040
And right there on the front steps we see Ash Hornbeam.

28:06.040 --> 28:12.040
He's wearing one of those like crisis blankets and he's got some hot cocoa in his hands

28:12.040 --> 28:17.040
and there's an officer from the contention police force there talking to him.

28:17.040 --> 28:23.040
Now, Mr. Hornbeam, what was it? What time did this all begin this evening?

28:23.040 --> 28:32.040
I started hearing some noises in my basement around 5.30.

28:32.040 --> 28:37.040
Around 5.30, okay. And what kind of voices were these?

28:37.040 --> 28:42.040
I think it was two voices, maybe three, but I'm pretty sure two men's voices.

28:42.040 --> 28:45.040
Two men's voices, okay. And did you get a good look at these men?

28:45.040 --> 28:51.040
Not a great look, but one was tall and skinny and one was short and fat.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.040
Classic two man robbery team.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.040
Mm-hmm, trench coats.

28:54.040 --> 28:59.040
What is it that they seem to have been looking for and or have stolen?

28:59.040 --> 29:05.040
Well, I think they were after, my dad's got a real big coin collection that's pretty well known.

29:05.040 --> 29:10.040
He takes them to coin shows and shows them off and he's got some real valuable stuff down there.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.040
He keeps them locked up in the basement.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.040
Locked up in the basement, okay.

29:15.040 --> 29:23.040
And then we flash back to Ash Hornbeam in his home all alone a few hours earlier.

29:23.040 --> 29:30.040
Ash Hornbeam is home alone watching TV and he sees an ad, made for TV ad kind of thing,

29:30.040 --> 29:36.040
for something he really wants to buy. It was like a CD player, I think, that he wanted.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.040
Three disc changer.

29:37.040 --> 29:41.040
Three disc changer for how much it cost. His allowance was not going to pay for it.

29:41.040 --> 29:46.040
So he hatched an idea to try to get into those coins.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.040
Get into the coins?

29:47.040 --> 29:53.040
Yeah, to get into the lockbox the coins were in so that he could sell them and buy that new CD player.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.040
So how did he pull this off?

29:55.040 --> 30:02.040
He kind of rummaged through his parents' room. He didn't know the code to it, but looking for maybe clues of what it could be.

30:02.040 --> 30:06.040
He didn't really find anything, so he went down there and just started typing in birthdays.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.040
And eventually?

30:07.040 --> 30:08.040
It was my birthday.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.040
Aw, your parents love you so much.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.040
Yep, and I'm taking their stuff.

30:12.040 --> 30:20.040
So there was in the lockbox the entire coin collection valued at $40,000.

30:20.040 --> 30:24.040
Yeah, some real nice stuff. And then a handgun.

30:24.040 --> 30:29.040
He knows which ones were more valuable, so he just took a handful, not the whole thing.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.040
He didn't need $40,000.

30:31.040 --> 30:35.040
But he takes about $600 worth of coins.

30:35.040 --> 30:38.040
And then we flash back to this officer talking to you.

30:38.040 --> 30:44.040
And he's like, so we walked through the house and we saw there's just a mess all over the place.

30:44.040 --> 30:48.040
I mean, you got paint cans that are hanging from strings.

30:48.040 --> 30:54.040
You know, when I heard them down in there I figured, you know, I gotta defend myself and get them out of here.

30:54.040 --> 31:01.040
So yeah, I found some paint cans in the garage and some hammers and tied strings to them.

31:02.040 --> 31:06.040
I learned how to do a trip wire when I was in the Boy Scouts.

31:06.040 --> 31:13.040
So I did that by the stairs and when they were coming up I threw marbles down the stairs and they fell down and then they were mad.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.040
So they were coming after me.

31:15.040 --> 31:24.040
And then, yeah, the first one, the tall one, he tripped the first wire and the paint bucket swaying right into his face covered him with that paint that's all over the ground.

31:24.040 --> 31:29.040
And then the second one came up, the shorter one came up and the other trip wire.

31:29.040 --> 31:36.040
Yeah, the second trip wire that I did, the hammers came and whacked him on either side of the head and he fell back down and got paint all over him.

31:36.040 --> 31:40.040
And then I yelled that I was going to call the police and that I had a gun.

31:40.040 --> 31:44.040
And then, yeah, then I called you guys.

31:44.040 --> 31:51.040
And then the front door swings open and walking out is another police officer from contention.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.040
And the first one that you're talking to is like, no, no, no, hold on.

31:54.040 --> 32:02.040
And before he can stop him, a bucket falls down on the top of this guy's head and he's like, oh no.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.040
Yeah, it was a bucket that I had made that goo stuff out of.

32:06.040 --> 32:11.040
But it went all over him and the buckets on his head so he can't see anything.

32:11.040 --> 32:13.040
He walks into the wall and falls down.

32:13.040 --> 32:18.040
And I'm like, well, you know, they must have gone out the back door because I set that one up for the front door.

32:18.040 --> 32:25.040
Okay, well, we're going to talk to your parents and then we'll have a report written up and we'll see if we can find these fellas.

32:25.040 --> 32:30.040
Yeah, I said one, they're both tall. They were both tall.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.040
Okay, so the short fat one was tall.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
He wasn't as tall. That's why I said short.

32:35.040 --> 32:38.040
Less tall, still tall. Okay.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.040
One was ugly. The other one was even uglier.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
Well, the most important thing is that-

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
And a beard.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
Oh, he's got a beard too.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.040
Yeah.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.040
Okay, well, this is really narrowing it down.

32:49.040 --> 32:53.040
Well, the most important thing I believe is that you feel safe here.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.040
Yeah, I think I've got to unbuby trap the rest of the house.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.040
So don't go walking upstairs or anything.

32:59.040 --> 33:02.040
But yeah, I feel safe now.

33:02.040 --> 33:04.040
I think I can defend myself.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.040
I think my parents are on their way back home too.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.040
Hey, Luke.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.040
Yeah.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.040
Did you get that three disc CD player?

33:10.040 --> 33:11.040
Yeah, he's got it.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.040
He carries it everywhere he goes.

33:14.040 --> 33:16.040
He's got Def Leppard on there.

33:16.040 --> 33:20.040
Of course. Def Leppard's really fitting.

33:20.040 --> 33:24.040
He's got Def Leppard. He's got Ramone's album.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.040
And then he's got a Madonna album in it too.

33:26.040 --> 33:29.040
Yeah, that's very important.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.040
Fucking Def Leppard.

33:31.040 --> 33:35.040
Alrighty, cutting back to present day or whatever your present day is.

33:35.040 --> 33:40.040
Cutting back to Ash Hornbeam with his arm stuck halfway into the hollow of this tree.

33:40.040 --> 33:43.040
This man's smile fades as he turns.

33:43.040 --> 33:48.040
Agent Kevin walks away from you back into the darkness of the woods.

33:48.040 --> 33:55.040
Ash stands there dumbfounded, wishing that that would have been a rescue.

33:55.040 --> 34:06.040
But he looks back down at his arm, looks at the tree, and just punches it with his left arm and looks down and defeat.

34:10.040 --> 34:26.040
Ash Hornbeam, you're standing still halfway the forearm out of this tree.

34:26.040 --> 34:34.040
And you see from the direction where Agent Kevin walked away, he's walking back and there's another figure with him.

34:34.040 --> 34:38.040
And as they come into focus, you see that it is a woman.

34:38.040 --> 34:48.040
She is wearing a black suit, a white shirt, black tie, and she is holding a machete that is glinting in the moonlight.

34:48.040 --> 34:58.040
And as she's walking toward you, you can hear she is chanting while she rubs one of her hands over this blade.

34:58.040 --> 35:09.040
And as she gets closer, you see she is smiling a cold, vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs that are covering one of her eyes.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.040
And the two of them finally get up to you.

35:13.040 --> 35:21.040
As they approach, he doesn't want to do it, but Ash just instinctually winks at them.

35:21.040 --> 35:30.040
Finger guns with his free arm and the hand that is stuck inside of the tree also finger guns.

35:30.040 --> 35:38.040
Ash winces a little bit from using his muscles in the tree. It kind of digs in just a little bit.

35:38.040 --> 35:45.040
But the wink and the free hand finger gun make up for the pain.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.040
Please don't make me roll.

35:49.040 --> 35:54.040
In two quick movements, Agent Kevin says, this is Agent Karen.

35:54.040 --> 36:01.040
And she lifts this machete that is glinting in the moonlight over her head and she brings it down swiftly right at your forearm.

36:01.040 --> 36:09.040
And you step back away from the tree and immediately out of shock reaction, you look at your forearm.

36:09.040 --> 36:15.040
And not only is the end of it completely cauterized, but it starts to grow back.

36:15.040 --> 36:22.040
And your forearm literally remolds itself into this kind of long stump at the end.

36:22.040 --> 36:28.040
So you don't have your hand, there's just this kind of long stump, but it's still this well-formed skin.

36:28.040 --> 36:35.040
And then from halfway up your forearm to about your wrist, it's still raw and red.

36:35.040 --> 36:38.040
And like, you know, you can see the muscle and tissue and stuff.

36:38.040 --> 36:41.040
She says absolutely nothing.

36:41.040 --> 36:46.040
She just like smiles at you and then turns around and starts walking the other way.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.040
Agent Kevin throws his arm around you.

36:48.040 --> 36:55.040
All right, we're going to need some more of that firecracker hand quickness, triggery fingers where we're going.

36:55.040 --> 37:05.040
And he leads you along with Agent Karen to a black sedan sitting next to a four-wheeler in the middle of the woods.

37:05.040 --> 37:14.040
And you can see through some of the brush and trees, there is a cabin and it's a stakeout, baby.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.040
Hell yeah.

37:16.040 --> 37:42.040
Taylor, Shadow, Sharon Berryman, if you will, is walking down the trail of the contention woods with Krista, the Krinklehoff matriarch.

37:42.040 --> 37:45.040
And I believe she was singing a song about death.

37:45.040 --> 37:49.040
Death is all around us, et cetera.

37:49.040 --> 37:54.040
Et cetera. And Krista is like not having any of it.

37:54.040 --> 38:01.040
She's like folded arms walking and the sun goes down behind the trees in the distance.

38:01.040 --> 38:11.040
And she pulls out a flashlight and begins leading the two of you on this dirt path of roots and rocks and only lit by the light of a flashlight.

38:11.040 --> 38:15.040
And then, oh, oh my goodness. Do you see that?

38:15.040 --> 38:22.040
And she points the flashlight over to the side like in the thick of the woods and she points the flashlight out there.

38:22.040 --> 38:25.040
She's like, oh, is that Liz?

38:25.040 --> 38:33.040
Krista immediately takes off into the brush of the woods with the flashlight kind of bouncing off these trees.

38:33.040 --> 38:36.040
Total darkness except for the moonlight and this flashlight.

38:36.040 --> 38:42.040
I run after her giggling because I see no importance in any of this and I'm having a great time.

38:42.040 --> 38:53.040
Yeah, absolutely. You've got the things dangling from your hands and you're like waving them back and forth and just kind of like whimsically running through the trees.

38:53.040 --> 39:02.040
And so since you don't care, I'm going to have you roll your alertness at negative 40 as you just put no effort into running through all these woods.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.040
What's your alertness normally?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.040
40.

39:05.040 --> 39:11.040
Oh, bummer town. So you have a zero. So, uh, let's see if you, if you roll an art one, that's a success.

39:11.040 --> 39:16.040
And if you, your dice matches a crit fail, so go ahead and roll those dice.

39:16.040 --> 39:19.040
Excellent odds.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.040
Nine 95.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.040
All right, so that is a fail.

39:23.040 --> 39:31.040
And you see the flashlight go completely dark as you feel a rope tighten around your ankle.

39:31.040 --> 39:44.040
And in this moonlit darkness, you lose control of your body and you lose your bearings completely as this rope hoists you up into the air upside down, hanging by one foot.

39:44.040 --> 40:01.040
The blood immediately begins rushing to your head and a bright light blinds you momentarily before Krista Krinklehoff turns the flashlight on herself under her chin like it's spooky story time.

40:01.040 --> 40:12.040
My darling, it is certifiably unfortunate that your demise is seemingly necessary, despite my finding your demeanor so appropriate for your kind.

40:12.040 --> 40:20.040
From your personal hems, I can assume and do hope that a lack of existence is your preference.

40:20.040 --> 40:25.040
And then I whispered to myself, finally.

40:26.040 --> 40:35.040
And you see a long silver tendril grows from the back of Krista Krinklehoff's neck.

40:35.040 --> 40:44.040
Then another, then another and another as the limbs extend toward your pinata like hanging body.

40:44.040 --> 40:53.040
The camera pans down to watch the long shadows play out this grizzly scene on the detritus below.

40:53.040 --> 40:59.040
One of the shiny tentacles slices into the soft tissue on the back of your neck.

40:59.040 --> 41:21.040
Another snaps your head forward and you feel the fracture as a third reaches in gripping the top of your spine and it rips your entire spinal cord down out of your body in one swift motion, promptly delivering you to your lack of a destination.

41:21.040 --> 41:25.040
And you feel nothing.

41:42.040 --> 41:45.040
Allie, you just told me something horrifying about your mom.

41:45.040 --> 41:52.040
I did. She used to hide under my bed and when I would run out from the bathroom at night, she would reach out and grab my ankle.

41:52.040 --> 41:55.040
That is wholly fucked up.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.040
It is so bad.

41:58.040 --> 42:16.040
So just imagine that feeling inside that you have like when your ankle would get grabbed is the exact horror that you feel as you're standing at the entrance of this bathroom that is attached to this shack at the trailhead of the contention woods.

42:16.040 --> 42:24.040
And the sun goes down and it's dark outside and it starts to rain behind you.

42:24.040 --> 42:34.040
Looking ahead, you see this body that is crumpled, folded even, wearing the state trooper uniform.

42:34.040 --> 42:41.040
And the body is Buzz Woodrow, if you will, and it is lifeless.

42:41.040 --> 42:45.040
So do you have forensics or SIGINT?

42:45.040 --> 42:47.040
I have a 20 in SIGINT.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.040
Oh yeah, go ahead and roll that.

42:49.040 --> 42:51.040
Okay.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.040
I got a 20.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.040
No way. That's incredible. That's a success.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.040
Oh yay. Good.

42:57.040 --> 43:07.040
Yeah. So you can tell looking around this bathroom, there was a tussle in here and you're like Sherlock Holmesing around the place.

43:07.040 --> 43:14.040
And what is something small from Krista Krinklehoff's purse?

43:14.040 --> 43:17.040
Something small. Chapstick?

43:17.040 --> 43:27.040
You see the exact brand of chapstick your mother, Krista Krinklehoff uses, has rolled behind the toilet of this place.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.040
Oh my god.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.040
Go ahead and roll sanity for me.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.040
I got a 14 on a 32.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.040
That is also a success.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.040
Wait, you had a 32 in first aid?

43:37.040 --> 43:38.040
No, you said sanity.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.040
Oh, I did say sanity?

43:40.040 --> 43:41.040
Do you mean first aid?

43:41.040 --> 43:43.040
How'd you do that?

43:43.040 --> 43:51.040
No, so you succeed. I think maybe inside you knew all along that your mom was a fucking bitch.

43:51.040 --> 43:55.040
I always knew. Krista.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
So now roll first aid for me.

43:57.040 --> 44:01.040
I was one roll ahead in my head.

44:01.040 --> 44:04.040
Okay, I got a 66 on a 50.

44:04.040 --> 44:14.040
You have absolutely no idea what happened here or why he's like this, but you feel a poke behind you as you're looking around this room.

44:14.040 --> 44:26.040
And the raccoon is standing in the doorway motioning like, let's get the fuck out of here.

44:26.040 --> 44:28.040
That's what the raccoon says with its arms.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.040
He says let's get the fuck out of here with his arms.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
Let's get the fuck out of here.

44:31.040 --> 44:32.040
Cool. I follow him.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.040
Okay.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.040
I'm losing my mind.

44:34.040 --> 44:37.040
That absolutely makes sense.

44:37.040 --> 44:46.040
Judy, you follow this raccoon out into the rain, into the darkness.

44:46.040 --> 44:52.040
There's one light that overshadows the entire parking lot and it's flickering.

44:52.040 --> 45:02.040
You turn the corner on the other side of the shack and looking down the trailhead, a lightning bolt flashes in the distance.

45:02.040 --> 45:14.040
And it's just enough to light up a blood-covered Krista Krenkelhoff who is walking directly toward you.

45:32.040 --> 45:42.040
The sun is sleeping soon.

45:42.040 --> 45:53.040
She knows that the time has come.

45:53.040 --> 46:22.040
To dance beneath the shadow of the moon.

46:22.040 --> 46:33.040
She moves with the howling wind.

46:33.040 --> 46:45.040
The sun has come again.

46:45.040 --> 46:56.040
Her eyes have seen it all.

46:56.040 --> 47:05.040
The wonders of the wonders of the shadow of the moon.
