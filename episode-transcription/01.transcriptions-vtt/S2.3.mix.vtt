00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Howdy-doody, my spooky-poopies.

00:03.080 --> 00:08.680
It's your turd-blasting, time-traveling, greasy, and parental figure wolf, the dog.

00:08.680 --> 00:14.240
And I'm here to provide sustenance to all of my little baby buddies.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.920
I'm tootin' at y'all live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:18.920 --> 00:26.280
the city's only radio station that also doubles as a crawdaddy bio-farm on the weekends.

00:26.280 --> 00:32.440
If we eat only the crawdaddies, what happens to all the crawmommies?

00:32.440 --> 00:37.760
Speakin' of weird shit that I'm forced to read that makes people mildly uncomfortable,

00:37.760 --> 00:40.560
this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Kyle.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.680
Remember, listener, Kyle asked for this.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.280
Kyle writes,

00:45.280 --> 00:48.200
To my darling wife, Steffy.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.600
Hundland, Hundland.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.960
Ow!

00:52.960 --> 00:55.400
Cough, cough, cough.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.480
Hundland, Hundland.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.720
Uh... thanks for that, Kyle.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.840
I hope your wife enjoyed that.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.560
I know I did.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.680
At certain parts, but mostly I didn't.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.280
If you wanna write up somethin' for your guttural wolf to how,

01:13.280 --> 01:16.360
tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram,

01:16.360 --> 01:18.800
tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,

01:18.800 --> 01:23.040
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice.

01:23.040 --> 01:28.080
Screenshot them deliciousnesses and send them my way.

01:28.080 --> 01:33.560
If you refuse to post on social media, but you still wanna support the show,

01:33.560 --> 01:38.080
give us money in exchange for a whole bunch of bonus episodes,

01:38.080 --> 01:41.880
access to submit NPCs and locations,

01:41.880 --> 01:44.680
behind-the-scenes livestreams,

01:44.680 --> 01:47.080
exclusive T-shirts,

01:47.080 --> 01:49.840
and et cetera, et cetera.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.760
It also helps give Zach the little bits of sausage he needs

01:53.760 --> 01:59.160
that keep him goin' as he produces, GMs, and edits this fine show.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.800
Links to all that and Wolfie's merch store are,

02:02.800 --> 02:06.000
you guessed it, in the show notes.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.360
For those just tunin' in, I'm Wolf the Dog.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.720
You are listening to 694.2 PTBP,

02:13.720 --> 02:16.400
and this is the news.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.840
Last time, we learned about the new field producer, Julius Summers,

02:21.840 --> 02:26.640
and his childhood connection to the City Action News Studios.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.560
And when Julius was a child, crawlin' around gnawin' on marbles that were,

02:31.560 --> 02:34.640
of course, securely fastened to the floor,

02:34.680 --> 02:40.640
Well, back then, Cal Colorado was the frothy film of the slot bucket, my babies.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.680
He was on top.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.240
His trusty field camera operator, Beck Wilder,

02:46.240 --> 02:49.600
sided with Julius against Cal Colorado

02:49.600 --> 02:53.600
when the team was asked to follow a lead that Cal balked at.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.840
Let's see if we can top that.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.360
Here's a brand new rock act.

02:58.360 --> 03:04.400
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.240
And it's all my fault

03:08.520 --> 03:12.840
Cos my life is great

03:13.480 --> 03:15.480
And it's all mine

03:22.960 --> 03:27.120
Cos my life is great

03:27.880 --> 03:30.520
And it's all my fault

03:34.400 --> 03:42.600
I never record the good jokes.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.800
I swear, that's not what this podcast is about.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.840
I've got a month of Bumble Premium.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.880
Hell yeah, dude. Find somebody in to piss play.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.120
Did they maybe give you the first month free?

03:53.120 --> 03:58.480
No, no, no. My phone did this in my pocket while we were at brunch,

03:58.480 --> 04:00.360
looking at the charge.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.480
Cos I was talking to somebody and stuck my phone in my pocket while we were messaging.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.800
Oh no, how much?

04:06.800 --> 04:09.240
30 bucks. Could be worse.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.360
That's still insane for a month.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.600
That is insane for a month.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.480
But I was hoping, oh wow.

04:15.480 --> 04:19.080
You just made me feel fine about this, I guess.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.240
No, actually I don't. That's almost an eighth of weed. Fuck that.

04:22.240 --> 04:27.920
I was gonna hit up my person today.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.760
And instead I have a month of Bumble Premium.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.080
I guess I'm gonna have to make the most of this.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.680
Yeah dude, go fucking wild on Bumble now.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.080
Fucking unlimited swipes.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.880
What is Bumble?

04:44.880 --> 04:47.160
Bumble's the one where the women message you first.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.360
Oh, okay. Got you.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.880
So you never get like anything live?

04:51.880 --> 04:54.760
No, no. It's all a trick.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.520
I don't think they're real.

04:56.520 --> 05:02.320
Yeah, mine was broken, I think.

05:02.320 --> 05:06.560
Welcome to episode three of Pretending to Be People.

05:06.560 --> 05:11.600
I could add weed, y'all.

05:11.600 --> 05:16.800
Instead I might get a life partner.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.320
Fuck me.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.520
How's it going?

05:20.520 --> 05:23.160
Oh, it's fine.

05:23.160 --> 05:27.960
You know, a little miffed.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.440
I've been scrolling through TikTok,

05:29.440 --> 05:33.760
disappointed that Kan hasn't updated in a while.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.840
City Action News, if this is your first time

05:35.840 --> 05:36.880
listening to the podcast.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.960
Also go back and listen to episode one.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.560
If this is your first episode,

05:40.560 --> 05:43.080
this is the perfect time to go back a couple episodes.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.480
We only got three now.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.360
This is the only time where we can say

05:46.360 --> 05:47.480
just go back a couple.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.680
Now is the easiest time to make sure you go back now.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.480
If you're in the next episode listening for the first time

05:53.480 --> 05:55.040
and you go back a couple,

05:55.040 --> 05:58.840
ooh, I'd rather you went back a few.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.440
Hey, fair point, but it's not like we're at 10.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.760
It's not like we're at 10.

06:04.760 --> 06:09.520
I don't have a fun folksy word for nine.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.360
Say it like Mr. Lemon.

06:11.360 --> 06:16.120
Well, I say you have to go back nine episodes.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.640
Did you like that? Say it like the editor.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.960
Oh, well, you'd have to go back nine episodes.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.280
Was any a little weird? Vivica?

06:23.280 --> 06:25.080
Oh, who was the guy who sounded weird?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.320
Do you mean Jeremy?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.840
Oh, the intern.

06:27.840 --> 06:28.800
Oh yeah, I do.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.640
Yeah.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.160
Oh, speaking of Jeremy,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.280
this episode starts with a shot of Jeremy

06:35.280 --> 06:37.160
standing in the parking lot,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.640
standing in the empty spot where the can van

06:39.640 --> 06:44.560
just was holding a hot iced latte

06:44.560 --> 06:46.840
and two energy drinks.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.240
It's about now in the van that Beck remembers that,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.920
oh, damn it, we forgot our drinks.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.000
Damn it.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.880
And he begins sprinting down the road

06:58.880 --> 07:01.640
through traffic holding these three items.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.480
We didn't get very far, did we?

07:02.480 --> 07:03.320
We did not get very far.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.160
We're stuck.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.600
I said that you got pretty much trapped in gridlock

07:06.600 --> 07:08.120
almost immediately.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.200
So let's see the inside of this van.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.720
Hey, does the city suck?

07:11.720 --> 07:16.240
Oh, I mean, you're here at what?

07:16.240 --> 07:20.320
Like 6 p.m. in the middle of downtown.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.280
Shit is.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.120
So?

07:22.120 --> 07:22.960
Shit's fucked.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.320
Right, and when he says, does the city suck?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.360
That's actually the beginning of the TikTok.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.080
He's asking the person in front of us in their car

07:30.080 --> 07:31.640
that question.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.480
What?

07:32.480 --> 07:33.680
Does the city suck?

07:33.680 --> 07:36.960
I don't think Cal Colorado would ever say those words.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.800
Yeah.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.040
We've only known him for two episodes,

07:41.040 --> 07:44.040
but there's no fucking way Cal Colorado's saying that.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.560
But you could try to talk him into it and scene.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.040
Wait, that's at the end.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.240
How do you start one?

07:51.240 --> 07:52.800
Fire.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.640
Fire.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.000
That's why you don't yell fire in a theater

07:58.000 --> 07:59.840
because they'll think it means well.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.360
It's time to start.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.080
Fire!

08:03.080 --> 08:06.000
Beck is holding the phone ready to film a TikTok,

08:06.000 --> 08:07.840
but he still doesn't have a clear idea

08:07.840 --> 08:11.000
of what he's looking to the producer for guidance.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.220
Julius is scrambling for ideas

08:13.260 --> 08:14.740
and just kind of looking around

08:14.740 --> 08:18.700
and he sees a pizza at Cal's own shop.

08:19.580 --> 08:20.740
And he looks at Cal.

08:20.740 --> 08:22.220
Oh my God.

08:22.220 --> 08:23.060
And he looks back.

08:23.060 --> 08:23.900
And he looks back.

08:23.900 --> 08:24.740
Oh my God.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.100
Oh my God.

08:26.100 --> 08:29.420
Cal is blinking and smiling and here at TikTok,

08:29.420 --> 08:30.900
so he's telling you the time.

08:33.340 --> 08:36.900
Cal, how do you feel about eating something?

08:36.900 --> 08:40.460
I had a sensible lunch and breakfast.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.780
I, no, I don't think I could eat right now.

08:43.780 --> 08:45.260
Just a bite or two.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.500
I'm sorry, I don't know if you've noticed,

08:46.500 --> 08:48.740
but I do keep my figure trim.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.140
Then let's ask these people some questions.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.340
And I just point to like people walking.

08:53.340 --> 08:54.740
Man on the street, I love it.

08:54.740 --> 08:58.260
You see a guy who with a massive beanie,

08:58.260 --> 09:02.940
it's like way too big and it's drooped over his eyes almost.

09:02.940 --> 09:06.780
He's walking like he's sitting down, but he's walking.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.800
And-

09:07.800 --> 09:08.740
I'm sorry, Zach, what?

09:08.740 --> 09:10.340
He's walking like he's sitting down,

09:11.180 --> 09:12.000
but he's walking.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.840
So he's ass-

09:12.840 --> 09:13.660
You've seen people, right?

09:13.660 --> 09:14.500
Oh man.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.260
His ass is like even with his knees.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.100
Yeah, he's like-

09:18.100 --> 09:19.340
Zach, what do you think walking?

09:19.340 --> 09:22.420
He's just like squat walking

09:22.420 --> 09:24.980
and kind of like dancing around.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.260
Cal has a microphone in his face.

09:26.260 --> 09:27.580
You, sir, what are you doing?

09:27.580 --> 09:28.420
Roll, roll, roll.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.460
Hey, I'm just dancing, I'm dancing.

09:30.460 --> 09:32.360
And he's just kind of doing this weird,

09:32.360 --> 09:35.140
like sitting dance thing, like a silly walk.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.820
And he's just like, you know,

09:36.820 --> 09:38.980
I like to get through the city by dancing.

09:38.980 --> 09:40.180
You see these cars here?

09:41.060 --> 09:41.900
They're stuck.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.020
I'm not stuck.

09:43.020 --> 09:43.940
I'm free.

09:43.940 --> 09:47.140
You're never stuck if you have your legs.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.980
A disturbingly ableist message.

09:51.740 --> 09:52.740
From the Cal zone.

09:52.740 --> 09:53.780
From the Cal zone.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.420
Hey, Cal, how about instead of that,

09:57.420 --> 10:01.700
we try like you try to dance like him with him.

10:01.700 --> 10:02.740
That might be amusing.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.260
He reaches out for your hand.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.500
Oh, a street man.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.840
Okay.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.060
Cal takes his hand, but then yeah,

10:10.780 --> 10:11.660
Cal is nailing it.

10:11.660 --> 10:13.220
Cal is like athletic.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.320
Awesome.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.260
Cal watches this guy move and then moves like that.

10:20.260 --> 10:23.860
The Cal zone is a thing that you had already coined

10:23.860 --> 10:25.280
in your basketball days.

10:29.900 --> 10:32.140
Well, yeah, I mean, I played some D

10:32.140 --> 10:35.860
and when they got in the Cal zone, they got slapped down.

10:35.860 --> 10:37.060
Your sign off needs to be,

10:37.060 --> 10:40.340
and that's another slam dunk from the Cal zone.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.540
That's some more hot D from the Cal zone.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.020
Oh yeah.

10:44.020 --> 10:46.380
That's a wild catchphrase.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.860
Just like my basketball dance.

10:50.180 --> 10:51.940
Beck stops filming and on TikTok,

10:51.940 --> 10:53.860
he's doing, he's maybe adding a filter

10:53.860 --> 10:55.380
and he's putting the text over the top

10:55.380 --> 10:57.860
and it's when you in the Cal zone.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.540
Oh, fuck yeah, dude.

10:59.540 --> 11:00.620
That face when.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.720
What's the song?

11:02.780 --> 11:03.780
Whoop, there it is.

11:03.780 --> 11:08.780
Oh, fuck yeah, whoop, there it is, whoop, there it is.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.380
Before I hit send, I give it to Julius.

11:14.380 --> 11:18.620
Julius adds, Julius looks at it and looks at Beck

11:18.620 --> 11:22.000
like just stoked that it's perfect.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
And he just adds the caption, another fresh hot Cal zone.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.660
Fuck yes.

11:30.660 --> 11:32.620
As soon as it's blasted out,

11:32.620 --> 11:35.360
literally the second it posts a TikTok,

11:35.360 --> 11:38.580
you get a notification on your cell phone, Julius

11:38.580 --> 11:43.460
and Tife has hearted the message that he sent you.

11:43.460 --> 11:44.300
Oh, the-

11:44.300 --> 11:45.660
Make a TikTok, bitch.

11:45.660 --> 11:46.500
Oh, right.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.300
I text him back, like open the news tonight

11:49.300 --> 11:52.360
saying that we posted a TikTok or something like that.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.200
Like make-

11:53.200 --> 11:56.220
Open the news tonight, saying that we posted a TikTok,

11:56.220 --> 11:57.180
something like that.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.480
Or something.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.280
Breaking news, a new TikTok is dropped.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.740
As you guys are all reconvened, as you were all-

12:10.920 --> 12:12.120
Recalvened.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.020
After you've all recalvened back in the can van.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.160
Jesus.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.180
Can we start the season two over?

12:27.360 --> 12:28.820
I'm not feeling the can van.

12:30.480 --> 12:35.480
You see a man running, sprinting in between two lanes

12:35.480 --> 12:38.820
of traffic in the rear view mirror on the can van.

12:38.820 --> 12:43.820
And he is holding one hot ice latte and two energy drinks.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.800
And he approaches the van and he's like,

12:54.240 --> 12:58.360
Okay, I got your hot ice latte.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.180
They were not happy about that order, Julius,

13:01.180 --> 13:02.020
but I got it funny.

13:02.020 --> 13:04.440
He takes it and he's surprised that it is somehow

13:04.440 --> 13:07.180
both very hot and very cold.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.440
And here are these for you, Beck.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.260
Hell yeah, man.

13:09.260 --> 13:12.160
I almost had to go to the backups and he pets the backpack

13:12.160 --> 13:14.200
that he has with him that has a bunch of extra cans

13:14.200 --> 13:15.040
of energy drink.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.940
And a patch with energy drink on it.

13:17.940 --> 13:21.560
Cal has Julius's phone and he's just watching the TikTok

13:21.560 --> 13:23.880
like repeatedly with a huge grin on his face.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.000
Awesome.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.240
And he kind of like absentmindedly notices

13:29.080 --> 13:30.640
that the intern has run up and he's like,

13:30.640 --> 13:32.880
and if you could get me a black coffee, please.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.800
Cal, you get a text message at the exact same time

13:41.800 --> 13:42.760
as Julius.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.920
It's a group text between Taif, Cal and Julius.

13:46.920 --> 13:50.500
And he says, her name is Kaylee Silver.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.600
Shout out to Distant Egg Song in Houston.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.440
Hey.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.500
For Kaylee Silver, we'll likely meet her soon.

13:57.500 --> 14:01.760
Kaylee Silver, it says, specifically asked for Cal

14:01.760 --> 14:06.660
because he is a truth above all type of guy.

14:06.660 --> 14:11.540
She grew up watching him on TV and she trusts him.

14:11.540 --> 14:14.180
So that first thing he likes,

14:14.180 --> 14:16.100
then I grew up watching you on TV.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.100
That gives him pause.

14:17.100 --> 14:17.940
Sure.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.760
He's heard that.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.900
That can go a lot of ways.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.220
And as you're reading that text,

14:21.220 --> 14:23.940
immediately back is Jeremy.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.220
Whew, wowzer.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.460
Yeah, that is a hot black coffee.

14:29.460 --> 14:32.700
The quickest coffee run, I time myself, thank you,

14:32.700 --> 14:34.980
that I have ever made.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.180
Thankfully, because, and he points behind him.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.780
The Cal zone plays sold coffee.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.220
I went to the U zone.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.060
Oh, thank you, Jeremy.

14:45.060 --> 14:46.520
Cal kind of realizes what he's done.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.540
He like realizes they're in the street and not the office

14:49.540 --> 14:51.400
and gives him a big thumbs up.

14:51.400 --> 14:55.460
And he thumbs ups back and then sprints off backwards

14:55.460 --> 14:56.740
from where he came from.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.940
He sprints backwards.

15:01.740 --> 15:04.020
I think we found our first horror mystery.

15:04.020 --> 15:05.620
I said what I said.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.860
Yeah, and he's sitting while he does it for five seconds.

15:08.860 --> 15:12.540
So we could talk to this weird pervert

15:12.540 --> 15:15.500
or we could go find out what's going on

15:15.500 --> 15:16.940
with backwards running, man.

15:18.860 --> 15:23.860
Traffic moves at a snail's pace for like 15 minutes.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.180
And then eventually it kind of opens up

15:27.180 --> 15:29.140
and you guys get to your destination

15:29.140 --> 15:31.580
in a matter of like five minutes.

15:31.580 --> 15:35.660
It is a mid-rise, downtown in the city.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.780
And on that piece of paper that you have

15:37.780 --> 15:40.680
says apartment 836.

15:41.980 --> 15:44.820
I pull the van up and park right in front.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.900
Beck hops out and is already getting some B-roll

15:46.900 --> 15:48.460
of the outside of the building.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.580
But he's also bringing everything he's gonna need.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.460
So he's got a tripod under an arm

15:52.500 --> 15:55.340
and his case of camera equipment.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.220
What's Cal doing?

15:56.220 --> 15:59.020
What's running through his mind?

15:59.020 --> 16:00.740
I was talking to this girl on Bumble

16:00.740 --> 16:02.180
and we've hooked up a couple times

16:02.180 --> 16:04.500
and she was like,

16:04.500 --> 16:06.820
hey, this guy just sent me this really weird dick pic

16:06.820 --> 16:08.780
and I don't know if it's like diseased or what.

16:08.780 --> 16:12.780
And I was like, well, I kind of want to see that.

16:12.780 --> 16:14.180
And she just sent it to me.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.260
You did not want to see that, no.

16:16.260 --> 16:17.100
Oh man.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.660
Cal has a crazy life.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.940
Yeah, we all make decisions.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.740
I'm not sure I would have made that one.

16:26.740 --> 16:29.060
Was that like a play of some sort?

16:29.060 --> 16:32.740
Of like just showing off your personality early?

16:32.740 --> 16:35.900
No, again, this is a person I've had sex with.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.900
Yeah, like he could have that.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.060
That's what I thought.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.620
No, no, no.

16:47.620 --> 16:49.860
She was like this dude sent me a dick pic

16:49.900 --> 16:51.540
and it looked really weird.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.820
Is it the dick pic that you sent her?

16:55.220 --> 17:00.220
No, I'm about to send her one to show her a normal dick.

17:01.060 --> 17:03.020
Cool, that was a question mark.

17:05.260 --> 17:06.660
Did you look at it again, you freak?

17:06.660 --> 17:09.380
Oh no, she just sent a description of it.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.460
Hot.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.020
It's got a weird texture.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.940
Sounds like Bumble Premium is worth it.

17:13.940 --> 17:14.780
Yeah.

17:15.700 --> 17:20.700
She's like doesn't it look like a tongue and it does.

17:24.420 --> 17:27.700
Well, that's going to be in season two somewhere.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.620
Doesn't it look like a tongue?

17:29.620 --> 17:32.220
And it does.

17:32.220 --> 17:33.380
It won't be a dick though.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.580
You guys want to see this dick?

17:34.580 --> 17:35.660
No.

17:35.660 --> 17:36.500
Not really.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.340
Good call.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.500
I'm sorry, I'm going to pee.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.660
I'm kind of bummed out by my own decisions.

17:45.580 --> 17:46.420
Fucking idiot.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.380
Why did I have taste buds?

18:01.380 --> 18:04.620
Did you go to the bathroom to jerk off to that picture?

18:04.620 --> 18:05.460
Yes.

18:06.780 --> 18:08.380
That's why it took me 20 seconds.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.460
Fucking pervert.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.860
Where the fuck were we?

18:10.860 --> 18:13.420
Well, I was jacking off to that dick pic in your bathroom.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.620
Let's start with me getting out of the van doing B-roll

18:15.620 --> 18:17.380
and you're asking Cal what he was doing.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.300
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.900
I asked Cal what he was doing and then we got into that.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.820
Julius, what are you doing

18:23.820 --> 18:26.620
as you guys approach this mid-rise?

18:26.620 --> 18:29.300
Julius is going to go in and wait for Beck

18:29.300 --> 18:32.020
to get some B-roll of him hitting the eight button

18:32.020 --> 18:32.940
on the elevator.

18:36.220 --> 18:38.980
Yeah, so people know where she lives.

18:38.980 --> 18:42.100
No, just not for this story, but for, you know,

18:42.140 --> 18:43.820
you can always use B-roll.

18:43.820 --> 18:44.980
Oh yeah, that's good.

18:44.980 --> 18:46.900
Beck is always, the B-roll doesn't have to be

18:46.900 --> 18:47.740
for that story.

18:47.740 --> 18:50.020
Like videography is his passion

18:50.020 --> 18:53.620
and he knows that he's always filming for stories these days

18:53.620 --> 18:55.700
but he likes to keep a collection of stuff

18:55.700 --> 18:57.140
he could use for art projects.

18:57.140 --> 19:02.140
And he's just kind of like elevator button projects.

19:03.180 --> 19:05.500
Yeah, that's why Julius was keeping him in mind.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.580
He's like, is there anything that could be like a quick shot?

19:08.580 --> 19:09.420
Oh yeah.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.300
You're familiar with his YouTube page.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.020
I had to do my research before I worked here.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.240
Joe, when you said like you were, Beck is always filming.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.580
I definitely pictured a John Wilson how-to situation.

19:20.580 --> 19:21.860
It's not funny.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.540
Yeah, well, I mean, he was an inspiration

19:24.540 --> 19:27.420
as far as the idea that he's always filming stuff.

19:27.420 --> 19:28.900
He inspired how-to John Wilson.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.300
Who knows how or when he'll use it.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.300
Exactly, Beck inspired John Wilson.

19:33.300 --> 19:36.180
Beck's like hot underground YouTube,

19:36.180 --> 19:40.100
experimental YouTube page inspired John Wilson

19:40.100 --> 19:41.380
to make how-to.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.640
As you guys make it to the front of the building,

19:43.640 --> 19:47.100
the doorman sees that your city action news

19:47.100 --> 19:49.340
and opens the door and lets you get in.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.100
Are you sure you don't want us to have like a 10 minute

19:51.100 --> 19:53.220
interaction with the doorman?

19:53.220 --> 19:54.460
Where we try to get in?

19:54.460 --> 19:56.500
Julius, you're in the elevator now,

19:56.500 --> 19:59.900
you're on your way up to the eighth floor of this building.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.920
And when the elevator door opens,

20:01.920 --> 20:06.220
you are in a stagnant, stale hallway.

20:06.260 --> 20:10.740
It smells like old cigarettes and Chinese food.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.900
It's not a bad smell.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.940
It's kind of comforting if you're me,

20:13.940 --> 20:15.100
but if you're me.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.440
I lived in an apartment building

20:18.440 --> 20:20.660
that smelled exactly like this.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.960
It's not comforting at all to Julius.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.580
It's propulsive even.

20:24.580 --> 20:27.620
He grew up with marble floors and privilege.

20:27.620 --> 20:31.540
And the carpet in the hallways of this apartment building

20:31.540 --> 20:36.540
is only made more timely in its interior design

20:37.220 --> 20:40.420
by the wallpaper that lines these hallways.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.400
It feels almost suffocating.

20:43.400 --> 20:48.400
Apartments 809 to 814 are to the left

20:49.300 --> 20:53.460
and then 819 to 836 are to the right.

20:53.460 --> 20:58.060
Kaylee Silver in apartment 836 will be to the right.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.180
We go to the right.

20:59.180 --> 21:00.620
How do you knock on the door?

21:02.500 --> 21:07.340
Apparently this is an important aspect of season two.

21:07.340 --> 21:08.900
So how do you knock on the door?

21:08.900 --> 21:12.260
Oh God that scared the shit out of me.

21:12.260 --> 21:15.940
I get my TikTok out and hand it over to him

21:15.940 --> 21:18.140
and I'm like, get like the surprise on her face

21:18.140 --> 21:19.940
when he knocks at the door.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.360
You hear the heavy breathing coming

21:26.360 --> 21:27.940
from the other side of the door.

21:27.940 --> 21:29.620
Cal makes this big step back.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.540
Shh, is it Cal?

21:34.540 --> 21:36.620
Yes ma'am, this is Cal Colorado.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.820
Wow, okay cool.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.080
My name is Kaylee Silver.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.340
I'm in a lot of trouble.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.860
Can you help me?

21:44.860 --> 21:47.140
Well, I'd love to see what I can do ma'am.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.420
Could you let us in?

21:48.420 --> 21:51.740
Unlock, chain unlock, deadbolt unlock.

21:51.740 --> 21:52.980
Is she saying all that?

21:53.980 --> 21:56.060
As Kaylee Silver pulls the three of you

21:56.060 --> 21:58.940
into apartment 836 and shuts the door,

21:58.940 --> 22:01.420
this 20 or 30 something and a choker necklace

22:02.260 --> 22:04.540
repositions a towel against the door's threshold

22:04.540 --> 22:07.860
and your noses tell your brains to tell you why.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.900
It smells like death in this apartment

22:10.900 --> 22:13.780
and there, strewn over the armrest of the couch

22:13.780 --> 22:17.700
is a sight that could affect your grip on reality.

22:17.700 --> 22:22.260
You see a pair of legs and your mind fills in the rest.

22:22.260 --> 22:25.060
I grab my phone back from you

22:25.060 --> 22:26.540
so that you can get your camera out.

22:26.540 --> 22:28.100
But there's a little bit of resistance

22:28.100 --> 22:31.780
that Beck was getting a shot of it instinctually.

22:31.780 --> 22:35.180
I want you guys to picture Seinfeld's apartment for this.

22:35.180 --> 22:36.740
That way we know where everything is.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.980
Are you familiar with the impossible geometry

22:38.980 --> 22:40.100
of Cherry Siderealm?

22:40.100 --> 22:44.480
Okay, roll grip.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.980
All right, but for real, I need everyone to roll grip

22:50.980 --> 22:53.380
which is your grip on reality.

22:53.380 --> 22:56.180
It is directly attached to the score of power.

22:56.220 --> 22:58.260
Power times five is gonna be your grip.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.820
We're replacing the word sanity in this campaign.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.260
Because we've found it problematic.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.260
And we really like the word grip.

23:04.260 --> 23:05.260
Losing your grip.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.100
It's cool.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.220
Yeah, we like it a lot.

23:07.220 --> 23:11.140
Plus maybe if in some instance we have,

23:11.140 --> 23:13.740
I don't know, some kind of situation in the past,

23:13.740 --> 23:15.180
you could really make it old timey.

23:15.180 --> 23:16.220
Oh yeah.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.740
Oh, you could make that word anything you want.

23:18.740 --> 23:19.860
Almost anything, yeah.

23:21.380 --> 23:22.580
We might have an array.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.140
It'd be really fun to do one of the 30s.

23:24.140 --> 23:24.980
I don't know what you're planning.

23:24.980 --> 23:25.820
Foxy.

23:27.340 --> 23:30.060
I mean, that's more of a teens, but yeah.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.860
You guys can play teens, whatever.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.940
So, I need you all to roll grip.

23:35.940 --> 23:36.780
I failed.

23:36.780 --> 23:37.900
Beck has pretty good grip.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.740
In fact, it's one of his best skills

23:39.740 --> 23:41.780
because it's related directly to your power

23:41.780 --> 23:42.620
which is my highest.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.460
Yeah, exactly.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.940
I rolled a 76 on a 75.

23:45.940 --> 23:46.980
Oh.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.340
Oh, fuck, dude.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.720
Damn.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.500
Well, Cal is an old professional

23:51.500 --> 23:53.740
and he rolled 39 on a 60.

23:53.740 --> 23:56.780
Yeah, Julius got a 62 on a 60.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.820
Beck, you shoot the news.

23:58.820 --> 24:00.700
This is not, you're not a police officer.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.460
This is not your job.

24:02.460 --> 24:03.660
Why are you here?

24:03.660 --> 24:05.100
She shouldn't have called you.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.180
This was just a story.

24:06.180 --> 24:08.940
He likes to film interviews and everything was fine

24:08.940 --> 24:10.460
and oh fuck, there's a body.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.880
That was not on the docket today.

24:16.420 --> 24:18.860
You don't have to look at her.

24:18.860 --> 24:19.980
Julius looks.

24:19.980 --> 24:20.820
Cal looks.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.300
Beck definitely looks.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.340
You're all gonna have to roll grip again

24:24.340 --> 24:26.540
as you see there's a streak of blood

24:26.540 --> 24:27.860
on the floor of the apartment

24:27.860 --> 24:30.540
where Kaylee Silver clearly dragged the body

24:30.540 --> 24:32.620
to then put her on the couch.

24:32.620 --> 24:34.300
You notice out of the corner of your eye,

24:34.300 --> 24:36.500
Kaylee's wincing as you all look

24:36.500 --> 24:39.700
and see the body of another 20 or 30 something

24:39.700 --> 24:44.200
but this corpse has been almost completely decapitated

24:44.200 --> 24:46.540
by something sharp enough to get the job done

24:46.540 --> 24:49.380
but blunt enough that some of the cuts

24:49.380 --> 24:52.180
look more like the skin was ripped apart.

24:52.820 --> 24:56.100
As you approach, you notice between the shoulders

24:56.100 --> 24:58.680
where this poor woman's neck and throat should be

24:58.680 --> 25:01.500
with blood caked all around it,

25:01.500 --> 25:04.660
you can see the top of her spinal cord

25:04.660 --> 25:07.660
and you can see right down her trachea.

25:09.220 --> 25:11.300
Did you pass that grip check?

25:11.300 --> 25:12.780
I did.

25:12.780 --> 25:13.780
39.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.180
I got a 92.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.940
Beck just needed to flip into oh shit, it's real mode.

25:18.940 --> 25:20.540
Now he's there.

25:20.540 --> 25:21.380
This isn't the first time

25:21.380 --> 25:23.860
he's had to cover terrible things.

25:23.860 --> 25:25.100
He's seen bodies before.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.020
Sure, just not unexpectedly.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.620
He just wasn't ready for it.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.540
He thought he was, yeah, this was a fluff piece.

25:29.540 --> 25:32.660
Same for Cal except he failed this role.

25:32.660 --> 25:36.220
He thought he was prepared after seeing the legs.

25:36.220 --> 25:38.160
He wasn't prepared for this.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.300
He vomits quietly in the hallway.

25:40.300 --> 25:43.460
I'm gonna need you both to roll a D4.

25:44.700 --> 25:45.540
Two.

25:45.540 --> 25:46.360
Two.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.200
One.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.300
You lose two grip, Julius,

25:48.300 --> 25:50.500
and Cal, you lose one grip.

25:51.340 --> 25:54.720
Cal is taken so far back, he is out in the hallway.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.880
I said he vomited quietly.

25:59.820 --> 26:00.660
Oh, sorry.

26:04.740 --> 26:06.680
How are you dealing with this, Julius?

26:06.680 --> 26:10.620
The legs made him very uncomfortable walking in

26:10.620 --> 26:12.260
and seeing a little bit of it.

26:12.260 --> 26:16.400
Even worse, he's just frozen there staring at it.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.000
Like, can't look away.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
I think that now that Beck passed,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.180
he's a little more in the moment for a second,

26:24.180 --> 26:26.480
and he's suddenly aware that he's standing in a room

26:26.480 --> 26:28.920
with a dead body and a woman saying, I didn't do it,

26:28.920 --> 26:31.360
which sometimes they did did it.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.160
Yeah, sometimes they did his did.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.160
The most likely person to have did it

26:36.160 --> 26:37.560
is the alive person in the room.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.720
He's putting a little bit of distance

26:38.720 --> 26:40.640
between himself and Kaylee,

26:40.640 --> 26:42.960
just in case she's maybe got a knife on her currently,

26:42.960 --> 26:43.920
even still.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.740
Everybody roll alertness.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.580
Fail.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.080
Pass.

26:50.080 --> 26:50.920
I failed.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.120
Julius, you see that there's a broken beer bottle

26:54.120 --> 26:55.840
under the coffee table

26:55.840 --> 26:59.940
that is absolutely dripping in blood.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.160
And Kaylee walks over to the kitchen

27:04.160 --> 27:05.840
and leans against the countertop

27:06.880 --> 27:09.400
and just turns back to you and is like,

27:09.400 --> 27:12.960
okay, I did it, but I had to do it.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.440
I did it, but I had to do it.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.360
You have to trust me.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.400
Julius is immediately looking over at Beck like,

27:18.680 --> 27:21.000
you've got to be getting this, right?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.920
She's already been in a closeup zoom

27:22.920 --> 27:25.280
to try and get micro expressions and everything.

27:25.280 --> 27:29.040
And she just confessed on camera, but she doesn't care.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.440
Killed them all, of course.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.560
It was self-defense.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.400
She was, I don't know how to say this,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.560
but she was trying to tear me apart.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.320
Why?

27:43.320 --> 27:44.960
Get it together, Kaylee.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.360
Kaylee is a young adult.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.680
She's got dirty blonde space buns

27:49.680 --> 27:53.760
and she's wearing a pink crop top with neon green ringers

27:53.760 --> 27:55.720
on the sleeves and the collar.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.480
It's one of those happy bunny shirts.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.840
When you say space buns, do you mean Princess Leia buns?

27:59.840 --> 28:02.680
Oh, I guess kind of, but just like buns

28:02.680 --> 28:05.080
that are on the top of her head, like little buns.

28:05.080 --> 28:05.920
What makes them space?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.760
Was it Xenon of the 21st century?

28:07.760 --> 28:08.720
Did she have those?

28:09.880 --> 28:14.320
You said she's mid thirties, space buns, cool crop top.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.160
Yeah.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.240
What's her deal?

28:16.280 --> 28:17.600
She just killed somebody.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.280
Yeah, but in self-defense.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.760
Yeah, it's like Xenon if those pigtails

28:21.760 --> 28:24.320
were like all wrapped up in buns.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.200
Oh yeah, I thought she had them.

28:26.200 --> 28:29.080
It's one of those happy bunny shirts from like Hot Topic

28:29.080 --> 28:32.400
and it says, it's not your fault, I'm blaming you anyway.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.240
Nice.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.280
She did it on purpose.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.540
That's Thomas's take.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.640
She said it was in self-defense.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.840
I promise.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.720
Cal has gathered himself a little bit

28:42.720 --> 28:45.280
and he wants to, I guess,

28:45.280 --> 28:49.140
humant that statement or what else would I look at?

28:49.140 --> 28:50.360
I want sincerity in her voice

28:50.360 --> 28:52.960
and then I'm also looking for signs of a physical struggle.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.400
Humant for her, forensics for the scene,

28:55.400 --> 28:56.640
if anybody wants to roll.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.520
Oh, fucking three.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.440
Nice. Nice.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.240
She seems extremely genuine.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.520
I did it, but I had to do, it was self-defense.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.080
I fucking promise you.

29:05.080 --> 29:05.920
Who is she?

29:07.640 --> 29:08.560
Who is she?

29:09.800 --> 29:11.120
She's my best friend.

29:13.120 --> 29:13.960
Kaylee.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.480
What's her deal?

29:15.480 --> 29:17.400
I'm Kaylee, she's Kaylee.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.080
It's spelled differently, but we're best friends.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.320
We like bonded on that.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Is this what really,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.240
because that's difficult podcasting.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.080
Is it?

29:27.080 --> 29:28.540
When we're talking about Kaylee at any moment,

29:28.540 --> 29:29.760
it could be two different people.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.760
One of them is dead.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.760
Yeah, it also sounds like a great situation for farce.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.240
Her name is Carolee.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.560
I did what I did.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.720
In the moment.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.080
I think you're the one that expressed

29:44.080 --> 29:46.720
that you regretted naming an NPC John

29:46.720 --> 29:49.600
and a PC John in the first season.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.400
Okay, but like, are we going to be talking to Kaylee

29:52.400 --> 29:54.360
for another 40 episodes or just right now?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.240
I think it's pretty fun.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.800
Also, Luke had an elegant solution.

29:56.800 --> 29:57.640
Carolee is her name.

29:57.640 --> 30:00.160
Kaylee, K period Lee.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.480
K dot Lee, Carole.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.400
Carole is the daughter of Cal.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.160
Yeah, that's her full name.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.360
If we're going on those rules.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.240
Yeah, her name is Kaylee.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.600
Spelled how?

30:11.600 --> 30:14.440
K-Y-L-E-I-G-H, Kaylee.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.280
Oh no.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.660
And her last name is?

30:17.660 --> 30:18.500
Kaylee.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.920
Yeah, I mean, it's gold.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.440
Oh, Kaylee silver, Kaylee gold.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.120
We're like, we're destined to be best friends.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.440
And for the past, fuck, 12 years,

30:28.440 --> 30:30.880
she's been my ride or die, you know?

30:30.880 --> 30:34.320
And then she comes at me, her eyes went somewhere else.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.720
She was just staring at my gut

30:36.720 --> 30:39.280
and she was trying to tear me apart.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.160
She was trying to tear me apart.

30:42.160 --> 30:45.360
Sorry, shit, fuck, keep it down, Kaylee.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.640
She was literally trying to get inside me.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.160
How often was it brought up

30:50.160 --> 30:52.360
that gold is better than silver?

30:55.360 --> 30:56.600
She starts crying.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.200
And Cal's like, was better than silver.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.340
I look at back, I'm like, please say you got it,

31:07.340 --> 31:08.840
please say you got it.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.200
And she just nods.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.040
Cal is kind of taking this all in

31:14.040 --> 31:16.400
and there is usable footage,

31:16.400 --> 31:19.460
but basically like this segment can't air as is, right?

31:19.460 --> 31:22.120
We can't just throw this on the news.

31:22.120 --> 31:26.180
Ms. Silver, if I could huddle with my crew for a moment,

31:26.180 --> 31:30.960
we wanna discuss the best way to cover your incident here.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.120
Yeah, no, of course I trust you.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.720
Like I said to whoever I talked to on the phone,

31:36.720 --> 31:38.860
I trust you, Cal.

31:38.860 --> 31:41.360
I know that you believe in the truth

31:41.360 --> 31:43.520
and I know that you are gonna find it, okay?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.520
You have to.

31:46.760 --> 31:49.060
That, like that stabs at Cal

31:49.060 --> 31:53.480
and he lingers a moment on her gaze and nods.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.080
A cat jumps up onto the countertop and she says,

31:56.080 --> 31:58.480
oh, hey girl, hey girl.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.320
That's Kaylee bronze.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.160
It's girl.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.280
I mean.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.400
Either way, Cal is walking away from,

32:08.400 --> 32:09.720
like he's huddling up.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.560
Yeah, totally.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.360
And Kaylee is just petting the cat

32:12.360 --> 32:13.760
and trying to calm down.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.480
And Julius is a camera off camera.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.960
Against Beck's better judgment,

32:17.960 --> 32:19.560
he doesn't ever like to turn the camera off

32:19.560 --> 32:22.320
in a place like this, but he goes ahead and does it.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.360
You've been in a place like this before?

32:26.360 --> 32:28.640
Yeah, Cal kind of leads everybody out in the hallway.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.720
The backs of your brains are fucking on fire.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.300
None of you can think straight.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.040
This is not your job.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.360
This is not normal.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.400
You are not having a normal day.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.000
You have some serious decisions to make

32:41.000 --> 32:43.880
that might have ramifications on the rest of your lives.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.880
We have to call 911.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.680
The police, my dudes, the police are needed here

32:48.680 --> 32:51.320
and like fucking yesterday.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.400
I'm glad to hear you both say that.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.880
I don't think we can err until the police are notified.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.800
We have to call them immediately.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.520
I'm gonna put you on that, Jesse.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.000
Pfft.

33:06.120 --> 33:06.960
Which is what he says.

33:06.960 --> 33:07.800
I'm looking around.

33:09.080 --> 33:09.920
Fuck yes.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.880
Beck and Julius are looking at each other.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.400
I'm looking for Mr. Lemon.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.520
But yeah, Julius is calling 911.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.080
911, what's your emergency?

33:22.080 --> 33:23.600
There's been a...

33:23.600 --> 33:25.400
Wait, hold on, let me take that again.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.240
911, what's your emergency?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.400
Now, why is everybody in the city caging?

33:32.480 --> 33:36.320
911, what's your emergency?

33:36.320 --> 33:37.160
Okay, let me try again.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.360
It is city funeral tradition to have a crawfish oil.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, that's true.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.800
Yeah, but that was like Mardi Gras in St. Louis.

33:44.800 --> 33:47.160
Like, I don't talk like that.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.800
911, what's your emergency?

33:52.800 --> 33:53.640
911.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.040
The Calvin story.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.880
On the 911 plan.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.800
911, what's your emergency?

34:08.800 --> 34:10.720
I need to report a murder.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.920
Oh, what?

34:12.920 --> 34:13.760
Holy shit!

34:15.920 --> 34:18.640
Literally, she's like, oh, okay.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.640
What's your address?

34:19.640 --> 34:21.960
I tell her the address that is on that piece of paper.

34:21.960 --> 34:22.800
Yep.

34:22.800 --> 34:23.640
Oh, that's downtown.

34:23.640 --> 34:24.920
Is that an apartment building?

34:24.920 --> 34:28.840
Yes, it's on the eighth floor, 836.

34:28.880 --> 34:32.400
I didn't do it, but I know who might have.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.240
Cal's like.

34:33.240 --> 34:36.120
And they left.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.080
They're gone, long gone.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.320
Julius is obviously not reading the signals

34:40.320 --> 34:42.280
from his partner as well at all.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.960
And he's like, nevermind, they're in the apartment.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.720
Cal is fierce.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.120
What are you, no.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.600
Hold on, hold on.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.080
This is someone who knows more.

34:52.080 --> 34:55.000
Hello, Cal, Colorado, City Action News.

34:55.000 --> 34:55.920
Oh, hi.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.840
They're, wow.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.680
May I ask who I'm speaking to?

35:00.680 --> 35:05.680
Yeah, my name's Jennifer, and I am speechless,

35:06.960 --> 35:09.920
but I need information as soon as possible.

35:09.920 --> 35:10.760
Well, Jennifer.

35:10.760 --> 35:11.960
And I'm talking to the right guy.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.000
I'm having a hell of a day.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.520
How's yours going?

35:14.520 --> 35:17.880
I, it was fine until now, I suppose.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.560
Tell me more about this homicide.

35:20.560 --> 35:24.200
Well, we were called to investigate a news story.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.760
You know, that's what I do.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.200
I do know that's what you do.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.440
With those, nope.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.800
It's fine, it's fine.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.080
With those piercing blue eyes of yours.

35:33.080 --> 35:33.920
I know.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.800
No, Jennifer, when we got down here, oh, I got Southern.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.200
I'm Southern, I see it, rubs off on people.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.680
Sorry, I thought I left this accent

35:42.680 --> 35:44.000
when I got to the city, but.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.400
Oh, no, it comes back so quick, don't it?

35:47.400 --> 35:52.000
There is a terribly mutilated body in this apartment.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.200
Now, the young woman here says she did it,

35:55.520 --> 35:58.520
but she says it was in self-defense, an act of necessity.

35:58.520 --> 36:02.040
The violence visited upon this corpse might belie that fact,

36:02.040 --> 36:04.240
but we are not the police.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.840
That's why we need you here to look at this.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.400
I think I'm going to Obama.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.000
Well, yeah, I mean, take this as high as you can.

36:13.000 --> 36:13.840
Take this as high as you can.

36:13.840 --> 36:14.660
Take this as high as you can.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.500
Take this as high as you can.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.320
Take this as high as you can.

36:16.320 --> 36:17.160
Take this as high as you can.

36:17.160 --> 36:18.000
Take this as high as you can.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.240
Do you know Obama?

36:20.560 --> 36:22.400
Roll the tape, you know Obama.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.480
Well, I don't want to brag,

36:23.520 --> 36:25.880
but I did interview him when he campaigned in the city.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.000
There is a picture of you and him hanging in your hallway.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.880
Yeah, one of the many pictures in the hallway

36:29.880 --> 36:30.840
is of Cal and Obama.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.000
It's not as big as the one that's Cal and Michelle.

36:33.000 --> 36:33.840
Sir.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.520
Okay, so I need you to stay on the line with me.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.960
Officers are on their way

36:38.960 --> 36:41.760
and they will be there very shortly.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.920
Was there a murder weapon?

36:42.920 --> 36:47.920
There appears to be, again, we're not investigators.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.960
We are journalists.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.240
We listen to the people who have found the facts

36:52.240 --> 36:54.240
and we try to report them as best we can.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.440
Now, is there a horribly bloody

36:57.440 --> 36:59.200
broken beer bottle on the floor?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.800
Yes.

37:00.800 --> 37:05.360
Is that the device that ripped this woman's neck apart?

37:05.360 --> 37:06.680
I could not say.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.320
Wow, okay, thank you.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.480
Have you talked to the woman who said that she did it?

37:11.480 --> 37:12.940
Has she told you anything more

37:12.940 --> 37:14.720
than just the fact that she did it?

37:14.720 --> 37:16.360
Well, she told us she did it

37:16.360 --> 37:18.360
and we immediately called you.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.960
Well, that was a very smart decision.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.080
We felt that literally anything else

37:23.080 --> 37:25.200
would be incredibly incriminating

37:25.200 --> 37:27.240
and it might implicate us in her crime.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.760
I'm very glad that you are not gonna go to prison, yes.

37:30.760 --> 37:31.760
Well, me too.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.280
That would have been not as fun to role-play,

37:34.280 --> 37:35.120
I don't think.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.160
I'm sure we could have come up with something.

37:39.160 --> 37:44.080
And role-playing prison would be another cool thing.

37:44.080 --> 37:44.920
You're right.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.880
Cal Colorado in prison.

37:46.880 --> 37:47.720
Holy shit.

37:47.720 --> 37:48.960
It might have to happen.

37:48.960 --> 37:52.680
All right, I have word that officers

37:52.680 --> 37:56.320
are on their way up the elevator to your location right now.

37:56.320 --> 37:59.080
And down the hallway, you hear the elevator.

38:02.360 --> 38:06.000
B-roll of cops pouring out of the elevator.

38:06.000 --> 38:06.840
Ding.

38:06.840 --> 38:07.680
Bex on it.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.560
Like smoke billowing from a chimney.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.920
These cops bumble out of this fucking elevator.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.680
Don't remind me of my.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.000
All right, it's clearly the premium team.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.280
And they approach you.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.600
It's two officers and.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.680
Two officers come pouring out of the elevator.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.520
Oh, sorry.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.840
It's six officers.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.320
After they get close enough

38:42.320 --> 38:43.760
that I've got a good shot of them,

38:43.760 --> 38:45.840
I wanna kinda put the camera down tiny bit

38:45.840 --> 38:47.880
and I wanna talk to them before they talk to us

38:47.880 --> 38:48.720
and I'm just gonna say,

38:49.440 --> 38:52.440
officers, she's not violent currently

38:52.440 --> 38:56.000
and she kinda has a rapport with Cal here.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.600
You might let him ease you guys in there.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.040
Ooh, role persuade.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.800
Fuck.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.040
It's a 60 on a 50.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.920
I'm gonna go ahead and use my luck.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.760
Ooh.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.960
Cause I wanna film Cal talking to her more.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.800
Awesome.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.640
Six, that's a good one.

39:14.640 --> 39:17.840
The first officer, you can tell by the look on his face

39:17.880 --> 39:20.080
that he's about to talk down to you

39:20.080 --> 39:21.480
and as he goes to talk,

39:23.920 --> 39:25.320
he's got a frog in his throat

39:25.320 --> 39:27.760
and one of the officers behind him says,

39:27.760 --> 39:29.760
yeah, I think that's probably a good idea.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.200
Cal, dude, she trusts you

39:32.200 --> 39:34.960
and like, I think at the end of the day,

39:34.960 --> 39:37.680
turning herself into the police is the right idea.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.000
I just think you need to make sure

39:39.000 --> 39:40.880
that she's convinced of that

39:40.880 --> 39:43.280
and maybe get to the bottom of why she did this

39:43.280 --> 39:46.280
and he's kinda winking so the cops can't see.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.800
You know, ask her some questions

39:47.800 --> 39:50.920
about what put her in a state of mind to do this

39:50.920 --> 39:53.000
and maybe get more about like what was happening

39:53.000 --> 39:56.040
right before they did this.

39:56.040 --> 39:58.800
And try to do a dance with her if you can.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.640
Hahaha.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.120
Cal has been like nodding, preparing his interview.

40:08.120 --> 40:08.960
Yeah.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.720
And then he hears that last part.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.560
Hahaha.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.040
And he kinda like, I will do what I can.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.000
Julius gets his phone out just in case.

40:18.000 --> 40:18.840
Hahaha.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.520
Yeah, Beck is definitely pulling up the camera

40:22.520 --> 40:25.120
and gonna just follow him into the room.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.520
As you go back in, you see Kaylee is at the kitchen island.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.880
She's hunched over and looking at her phone

40:30.880 --> 40:35.880
and she has wide eyes that cannot look away.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.500
And she's just staring at the screen.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.580
Cal kinda waves his hand in front of her eyes

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
and like snaps.

40:47.040 --> 40:47.880
Kaylee?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.000
Miss Silver.

40:50.000 --> 40:50.840
I have a furbo.

40:52.220 --> 40:53.060
I'm sorry, what?

40:53.060 --> 40:56.560
Ger, when I am out at work, I have a furbo.

40:56.560 --> 40:59.200
It records motion.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.480
Cal, she's got a camera.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.840
My producer is telling me that's some kind of camera.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.000
She holds the phone up to you

41:05.000 --> 41:09.620
and you're looking at footage from inside this apartment.

41:09.620 --> 41:12.840
You see Kaylee gold before she became the corpse

41:12.840 --> 41:15.000
laid out on the couch.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.560
In this grainy video, she's sitting on that same couch,

41:18.560 --> 41:21.360
petting Ger, shooting the shit.

41:21.360 --> 41:24.380
In the kitchen, you see Kaylee Silver

41:24.380 --> 41:26.680
before she killed her friend.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.380
She walks through the background

41:28.380 --> 41:30.720
and grabs a beer from the fridge.

41:30.720 --> 41:34.080
There's no label on the bottle, all is well.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.800
Kaylee gold is laughing.

41:35.800 --> 41:39.480
Kaylee Silver cracks her beer open, all is well.

41:39.480 --> 41:42.440
Kaylee gold begins telling a story.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.080
Kaylee Silver takes a swig.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.780
Something changes.

41:46.780 --> 41:50.380
Kaylee gold's neck snaps like she's a dog

41:50.380 --> 41:52.780
and Kaylee Silver's a squirrel.

41:52.780 --> 41:54.520
Gold's posture gets weird.

41:54.520 --> 41:58.380
She lunges, reaching out for Silver's stomach

41:58.380 --> 42:01.200
just under the neon crop top.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.060
I need you guys to roll grip.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.560
Pass with an 18.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.600
I pass with a five.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.400
I pass with a 26.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.340
We're still at Missleman.

42:11.340 --> 42:13.700
Kaylee Silver cries out.

42:13.700 --> 42:17.800
You can see the fear and panic and confusion in her eyes,

42:17.800 --> 42:20.940
both on this Furbo footage on her trembling phone

42:20.940 --> 42:23.580
as well as on her trembling face.

42:23.580 --> 42:26.620
In the video, she shoves her berserk bestie backward

42:26.620 --> 42:30.440
out of frame, but when Kaylee gold comes back into view,

42:30.440 --> 42:34.060
she's propelled herself horizontally through the air

42:34.060 --> 42:36.180
and she spears Kaylee Silver

42:36.180 --> 42:39.020
into and over the kitchen counter,

42:39.020 --> 42:41.820
out of the Furbo camera's view.

42:41.820 --> 42:45.900
You hear screams of anguish and glee

42:45.900 --> 42:47.540
and you hear a glass bottle break

42:47.540 --> 42:49.840
and a splash of beer hits the fridge.

42:50.860 --> 42:55.020
But then you just hear a percussive and visceral

42:55.020 --> 43:00.020
scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch.

43:04.160 --> 43:05.620
Then silence.

43:06.620 --> 43:09.220
Then a heartbreaking wail.

43:10.300 --> 43:13.860
Kaylee Silver stands here, phone out, frozen,

43:13.860 --> 43:17.500
tears filling up as much of the eyes as possible

43:17.500 --> 43:20.340
without yet spilling down her face.

43:20.340 --> 43:22.860
Kaylee, I'm glad you called us.

43:22.860 --> 43:25.380
I'm glad you could trust me.

43:25.380 --> 43:29.220
You're gonna have to go with the police now.

43:29.220 --> 43:31.980
Can you send me that footage before you go?

43:31.980 --> 43:33.580
Cal like glares at you

43:33.580 --> 43:36.300
but doesn't necessarily say anything to stop that.

43:36.300 --> 43:37.740
She hands you the phone.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.060
I email it to myself.

43:39.060 --> 43:41.260
Beck is just gonna kinda chime in.

43:41.260 --> 43:42.580
He doesn't normally do this.

43:42.580 --> 43:44.740
From behind the camera, he's a silent viewer,

43:44.740 --> 43:48.940
but he's now seen that she's 100% been truthful with us.

43:48.940 --> 43:51.340
You've got the proof right here, you're gonna be fine.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.860
She attacked you.

43:52.860 --> 43:54.580
Just as a little comforting word.

43:54.580 --> 43:56.300
She's looking at the door

43:56.300 --> 43:59.780
and she can sense the cops on the other side of it.

43:59.780 --> 44:01.100
I don't think we closed the door.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.980
Oh, okay, then she can see the six cops

44:03.980 --> 44:06.660
just kinda like peering in, staring.

44:06.660 --> 44:09.340
One of them's got handcuffs in their hands ready to go.

44:09.340 --> 44:11.660
I load up the video that I just sent myself

44:11.660 --> 44:14.300
and like go to show it to one of the cops.

44:14.300 --> 44:17.260
As you do so, the other one walks in.

44:17.260 --> 44:20.900
Ma'am, you have the right to remain silent.

44:20.900 --> 44:23.140
Everything you say can and will be held against you

44:23.140 --> 44:24.140
in a court of law.

44:24.140 --> 44:27.380
As he's like Miranda-ing her, Cal is saying,

44:27.420 --> 44:31.020
Kaylee, the video shows you acted in self-defense.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.780
Just tell them the truth, everything will be fine.

44:33.780 --> 44:34.980
It wasn't normal.

44:34.980 --> 44:35.820
It wasn't.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.340
What the fuck was it?

44:37.340 --> 44:38.620
They'll find out.

44:38.620 --> 44:41.100
Or will find out, please.

44:41.100 --> 44:43.540
And she is walked out the door

44:43.540 --> 44:45.820
and one of the other cops is like,

44:45.820 --> 44:49.100
all right, camera boys, get on out of here.

44:49.100 --> 44:51.180
Can't have you in an active crime scene.

44:51.180 --> 44:54.100
Can I try and use my 30% stealth

44:54.100 --> 44:57.060
to have kind of inched my way further back

44:57.660 --> 44:59.980
into the apartment to maybe get some wider angles

44:59.980 --> 45:01.020
of everything in the room?

45:01.020 --> 45:02.620
I think you can do that for sure.

45:05.300 --> 45:06.140
One.

45:06.140 --> 45:07.580
Yeah, dude, are you serious?

45:07.580 --> 45:08.860
I rolled a one.

45:08.860 --> 45:13.180
Oh my God, that's amazing.

45:13.180 --> 45:14.940
I don't know if this is the best roll to have that on,

45:14.940 --> 45:15.780
but it's fun.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.460
You can get any shot.

45:17.460 --> 45:19.580
As you're getting a roll around the apartment,

45:19.580 --> 45:23.980
you see that Kaylee Silver is an avid home brewer.

45:23.980 --> 45:24.900
She made the beer.

45:24.900 --> 45:25.940
She made the beer.

45:25.980 --> 45:27.660
Oh, that's dope.

45:27.660 --> 45:29.020
That is super dope.

45:29.940 --> 45:30.780
Which one?

45:30.780 --> 45:31.620
Silver is the brewer?

45:31.620 --> 45:33.460
Silver is the brewer, Silver's apartment.

45:33.460 --> 45:34.700
Gold is the friend.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.820
As soon as Silver drank the beer,

45:36.820 --> 45:39.140
Gold's neck snapped to attention.

45:39.140 --> 45:39.980
Fuck yeah, dude.

45:39.980 --> 45:40.820
Thank you for that.

45:40.820 --> 45:43.420
That's a good nugget on a crit.

45:44.380 --> 45:45.260
That is a good nugget.

45:45.260 --> 45:46.580
Also the kind of shit we would have spent

45:46.580 --> 45:48.460
like five episodes not finding out.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.700
And Zach would be like, why don't you solve my mystery?

45:53.980 --> 45:55.860
Perfect, perfect impression.

45:56.940 --> 45:59.220
I want to get pregnant with you.

45:59.220 --> 46:03.180
Don't do my normal voice on the show, dude.

46:03.180 --> 46:05.820
I've been working really hard on the podcast voice.

46:07.020 --> 46:09.100
I want to have a baby, Thomas.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.460
I want to have a baby with you.

46:14.060 --> 46:17.860
Julius texts his uncle, just like two thumbs up.

46:17.860 --> 46:18.740
We've got gold.

46:21.020 --> 46:21.860
Fuck.

46:26.820 --> 46:30.340
Hey Joe, should you be like a sleazy news producer?

46:33.060 --> 46:34.860
Cal looks blank.

46:34.860 --> 46:37.740
And he's kind of like looking around the apartment

46:37.740 --> 46:39.140
and just shaking his head.

46:39.140 --> 46:40.780
And he starts to walk out

46:40.780 --> 46:43.420
and he puts his arms around both of you.

46:43.420 --> 46:46.860
Boys, I haven't had a drink in 25 years.

46:46.860 --> 46:48.660
As the elevator doors are about to close,

46:48.660 --> 46:52.260
you hear Kaylee Silver holler out through the hallway.

46:52.260 --> 46:53.620
Help me, Colorado.

46:54.620 --> 46:55.780
You're my only hope.

46:56.780 --> 46:59.460
You see Cal's throat like completely close up at that.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.500
And he gulps.

47:01.380 --> 47:04.420
I'm taking you boys to the foundry.

47:20.220 --> 47:22.940
Ramona is scanning face to face to face

47:22.980 --> 47:24.580
around the table.

47:24.580 --> 47:26.220
What are you guys doing right now?

47:27.100 --> 47:28.220
She licked me.

47:28.220 --> 47:29.420
With that penis tongue?

47:30.740 --> 47:33.020
She was like, so did you zoom in on it?

47:33.020 --> 47:34.580
Oh my God.

47:34.580 --> 47:35.620
Had you?

47:35.620 --> 47:36.660
No.

47:36.660 --> 47:37.940
Did you then?

47:37.940 --> 47:39.580
No.

47:39.580 --> 47:41.100
Will you in the future?

47:41.100 --> 47:41.940
For you?

47:41.940 --> 47:42.780
Yeah.

47:42.780 --> 47:43.620
No, not for me.

47:43.620 --> 47:44.860
Jesus fucking Christ.

47:44.860 --> 47:46.140
I don't want to look at it.

47:46.140 --> 47:47.500
No, please don't.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.900
I was never into like looking at any of those,

47:49.900 --> 47:53.540
like, oh, two girls, one cup, a donkey man.

47:53.540 --> 47:54.820
Like I didn't watch any of that shit.

47:54.820 --> 47:55.660
Luke does.

47:55.660 --> 47:56.500
Donkey man.

47:57.580 --> 47:58.500
Oh my God.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.100
It does look like a tongue.

48:01.260 --> 48:02.100
You're right.

48:02.100 --> 48:02.940
I'm bummed out.

48:02.940 --> 48:03.780
I know.

48:09.420 --> 48:10.260
Well.

48:10.260 --> 48:12.140
I say again, can we restart season two?

48:19.900 --> 48:23.580
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

48:34.100 --> 48:37.700
Cause my life is great, and it's all mine.

48:49.900 --> 48:51.220
I'm bummed out.
