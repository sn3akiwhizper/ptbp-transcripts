00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Good evening to all of those who join me in this dimension we call home.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.700
It is I, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire and also Enjoyer of Slop.

00:13.700 --> 00:18.900
And I'm here to sling some sound directly to your ear canals.

00:18.900 --> 00:24.600
The radio station is called 694.2 PTBP.

00:24.600 --> 00:29.400
The time is now and forever ago simultaneously.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.300
And the best part of the show has arrived and it is starting.

00:34.300 --> 00:40.800
Now, this here howlin' with Wolf is from Ben Feliciano in Denver, Colorado.

00:40.800 --> 00:45.000
Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.700
A thing you can do too if you wanna rule.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.600
Like, rule, not rule.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.700
You know, Ben Feliciano rules.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.100
And he writes,

00:55.100 --> 00:57.500
Hey Pretendy Friendies.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.400
I'd like to howl at my bandmates in Younger than Neil.

01:01.400 --> 01:10.100
Listening to and talking about RPG podcasts is one of the many ways we pass the time at rehearsal or in the tour van.

01:10.100 --> 01:14.000
Besides trying to guess who farted by scent alone.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.500
We're no kudzu with no backbone but we do like making ska punk.

01:19.500 --> 01:24.500
A genre more dead than half the townspeople of the first season.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.600
And PTBP.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.800
If it's not too much to ask.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.100
On May 5th through the 27th of 2023.

01:33.100 --> 01:42.300
I'd love to meet any fellow Denver fans at the opening of my first solo art exhibit at Memento Mori Art Gallery.

01:42.300 --> 01:46.700
I'll be there on opening night and periodically throughout the month.

01:46.700 --> 01:51.600
Visit BenFeliciano.art for more details.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.500
Woof the dog.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.500
Praying for you but more importantly to you.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.400
Do you hear me, wolf?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.100
Do you smell the blood on your altar?

02:05.100 --> 02:08.100
P.S. Should I try different candles?

02:08.100 --> 02:10.900
Maybe you're not a fan of lavendar.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.800
Thank you dearest Ben.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.600
And I do hear you.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.400
I do smell you.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.700
And I do see you at all times.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.600
You're my favorite Ben so far.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.600
Even if you use the worst scented candle of all time.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.100
You make music, you make art, and you love little old me.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.100
And what's not to love about all of that?

02:35.100 --> 02:36.400
Remember y'all.

02:36.400 --> 02:42.100
Go to old Ben's art show if you can and tell everyone there that wolf sent you.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.400
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.100
Tag at PretendingPod on the internet.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.400
Fuck Al Gore.

02:49.400 --> 02:55.400
Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice and make me aware of it.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.300
Oh, hey, you.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.600
Yeah, you.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.000
You seem cool.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.100
So I'll let you in on a little secret.

03:04.100 --> 03:11.200
You can help support this show and make sure it keeps happening by exchanging five US dollars

03:11.200 --> 03:17.500
for shitloads of bonus content over at Patreon.com slash PretendingPod.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.100
There's other cool shit on the internet, too.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.500
And for a fair amount of it, the links are in the show notes.

03:24.500 --> 03:31.000
Lose your muse and choose to refuse an excuse to those whose blues cruise through the...

03:31.000 --> 03:31.900
What's that?

03:31.900 --> 03:33.200
No news?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.700
Are you for real?

03:34.700 --> 03:35.400
Ugh.

03:35.400 --> 03:42.800
My producer is telling me the boys, almost all of whom are in their early thirties now,

03:42.800 --> 03:46.000
except Luke who is seventeen years old.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.200
I guess these dude kids do a fine job of reminding themselves where they were before

03:52.200 --> 03:54.600
things really get going.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.500
Welcome back, y'all.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.800
And get ready for the world to unfurl.

03:59.800 --> 04:06.500
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and it's All My Fall.

04:06.500 --> 04:15.500
My life is great and it's all my fault.

04:15.500 --> 04:26.000
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.500
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

04:33.500 --> 04:46.600
I always get the, those like panda cookie things, you know what I'm talking about?

04:46.600 --> 04:50.600
They're like, I don't know, regular kind of cookie on the outside and then filled with

04:50.600 --> 04:54.100
panda with like chocolate and they're shaped like pandas.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.100
Whoa.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.100
That sounds good.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.600
They're super good, but they're always out of them.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.300
And so now I learned, if you ask, the lady will go in the back for you.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.400
What kind of cookie is the outer cookie?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.100
I will load it up and show you.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.700
That works in a lot of stores if they have it.

05:08.700 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, but I like never thought to do it cause I like, I would always like peek in the back

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
to see what was back there.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.500
And it's just like people that like look at you, like don't look back here.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
Like okay, I won't.

05:22.500 --> 05:26.600
I also picked up a sea salt flavored soda and it was really good.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
I know.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
They're called Hello Panda.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.600
Wait, I guess soda water.

05:32.600 --> 05:37.800
It's like, yeah, just like, I don't like cracker cookie kind of thing on the outside.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.800
Okay.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
Yeah.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.800
Yeah.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.800
It's not what you think.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.800
It's not salty flavored, but it's like sea salt because it's like sea salt ice cream.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.600
So it's kind of a creamy soda.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.840
It was really good.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.840
Is it a little salty?

05:48.840 --> 05:49.840
I'm sorry.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.000
Is it like sea salt ice cream or is it called sea salt ice cream?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.860
No, it's called sea salt soda.

05:53.860 --> 05:54.860
Is it a little?

05:54.860 --> 05:57.000
So it's like a cream soda with a little salt.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yeah.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.600
There wasn't a whole lot of saltiness to it, if any.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.400
Like I think it was just what the flavor profile was closest to.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.680
You thought disappointed Thomas and I are?

06:06.680 --> 06:07.680
I was too.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.680
Except that it was really good.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.680
Yeah.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Yeah.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
We're like, Joe, why didn't it suck?

06:11.680 --> 06:12.680
Hey Joe, what's your problem?

06:12.680 --> 06:16.680
Why aren't you talking shit on the thing you liked?

06:16.680 --> 06:20.680
I always get the mango milk tea things.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.680
Ooh.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.680
That sounds good.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.680
Yeah.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.680
Whereas sea salt soda is almost inherently misleading.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.680
Yeah.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
Yeah.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.360
It sounds like a fucking prank.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.360
It's not your fault, Joe.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.360
Yeah, it does.

06:32.360 --> 06:38.160
Welcome to episode 26 of season two of pretending to be people.

06:38.160 --> 06:42.580
We are back at it after a fair amount of time away.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.480
We were off in holy cow farmland.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.480
That's right.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.480
Yeah.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.480
It's shit.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.480
And for like four episodes.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.480
And before that we left you on a proverbial cliff.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
What?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
What?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.480
Who's that?

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
Who's here?

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
Who is it?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
Who is here?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
Who is she?

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
I don't even know.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.480
Say the Borat thing, Zach.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.480
Oh, I think we're live streaming.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.480
No.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.480
Nope.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.480
Nope.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
Nope.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.480
Nope.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.480
Just recording.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.480
It's your friendly neighborhood Taylor.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.480
Tell us a joke or a fact.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
Oh, whoa.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
See you, Taylor.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.480
Wow.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.480
What a weird fact that she said.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
She left a dust cloud like Taylor shaped.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
Yeah.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.480
She just zoomed away.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.120
And a Taylor shaped hole in the door.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.120
And my heart.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.840
All the way through the house.

07:22.840 --> 07:23.840
Aw.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.840
Oh, wait.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
Did you get that looked at?

07:26.840 --> 07:29.280
It hurts.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.160
That's way, Taylor is way bigger than just your heart.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.800
A lot of you has a hole through it right now.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.680
I think we're about the same size.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.840
I can see the plug, like the plug that shot out and hit the wall.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.840
In her shape.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.840
You're all crust.

07:42.840 --> 07:46.640
We could try to just squish it back together like a puzzle piece.

07:46.640 --> 07:51.160
That reminds me of a scene in Kung Pao Enter the Fist where he punches a guy's stomach

07:51.160 --> 07:52.160
out.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
And he's like, what?

07:53.160 --> 07:54.160
And then he's like, okay, you can pass.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.880
I was thinking of the scene in the first episode of The Boys.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.880
Oh, yeah.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.880
Shit.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.720
There's not much rippable there.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.680
I was just picturing just the outline of Luke.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.880
Oh, that's why you said just the crust.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
Just the crust.

08:08.880 --> 08:09.880
Like a cookie cutter.

08:09.880 --> 08:10.880
Yeah.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.880
I missed it and I thought you were saying that I was made out of crust or something.

08:13.880 --> 08:18.560
I thought it was more like it had already scabbed over and I was like, weird take.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.880
Weather or earth or pizza.

08:19.880 --> 08:20.880
Just the Luke crust.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.440
Just the Luke crust.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
And like dong.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.120
I think that's a realistic interpretation if they like stood like Michelangelo style

08:28.120 --> 08:30.960
and like he blasted Taylor through it.

08:30.960 --> 08:31.960
Yeah.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
Yep.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
The Vitruvian.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
Luke.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.960
Man.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
What would be a pizza?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.240
Like a Vitruvian.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.240
The Vitruvian.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.760
Last we left off, the can crew was out of sorts.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
Yeah.

08:43.760 --> 08:44.760
Yeah.

08:44.760 --> 08:48.480
Y'all done did a dang thing that people say that you're not supposed to do, but something

08:48.480 --> 08:52.800
that we here at Pretending to Be People really enjoyed it.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.800
We're fond of it.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
Yeah.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.800
If you split up.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.800
Split the crew, baby.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.440
You can solve more of the mystery.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.000
That's exactly right.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.240
For the Discord, spoiler chat, not for us who don't get to listen to those parts for

09:05.240 --> 09:08.760
like potentially a year and a half.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.200
There's still a lot of the first season that I haven't heard.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
Same.

09:12.200 --> 09:18.880
I went back through it for a lot of the Pennymore arc and respected a lot of choices more that

09:18.880 --> 09:21.920
other people had made because I understood them.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.920
Yeah.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.240
We had some cliffhangers there.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.600
Julius was off on his own.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
I said sayonara.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.600
Peace.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
Bye bye.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
We said deuces.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.600
Goodbye.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.600
Top notch.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.700
Top gun.

09:32.700 --> 09:38.020
I'm really happy with all the decisions that were made and what we're about to get into,

09:38.020 --> 09:39.600
which we've already recorded.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
Spoilers.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.760
I was going to say, who are you starting with?

09:44.760 --> 09:46.800
A little behind the scenes here.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.960
I think we're going to start with Luke, which we recorded a couple of days ago.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.960
It was good.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.000
So we'll all not be in the room then and then.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Okay.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.360
Well, should I leave the room for you to record them then?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.760
I'll leave the room now.

10:01.760 --> 10:09.120
Actually, yeah, that is what we need is a moment maybe as players together to talk about

10:09.120 --> 10:10.120
this.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.960
I'm not sure you guys are allowed to talk about that right now.

10:11.960 --> 10:12.960
I think we got to.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.960
You're the DM.

10:13.960 --> 10:14.960
You can.

10:14.960 --> 10:19.880
We have to reconvene.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.520
You know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile?

10:22.520 --> 10:23.520
No.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.480
You'll see one later and you'll see the other after a while.

10:27.480 --> 10:32.400
Speaking of which, we'll see you guys later while we cut to Julius.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
After crocodile wild.

10:34.400 --> 10:40.560
Alligator later.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.080
Maybe they've made a box around me with their space time bending powers.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.680
They have a certain eldritch hate fuck factor about that.

10:47.680 --> 10:53.880
Also Mr. Mime undoubtedly, canonically fucked Ash's mom and is his father.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.640
That's some big dick energy.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.640
Is that real?

10:56.640 --> 10:57.640
Okay.

10:57.640 --> 11:05.160
Last Google is Mr. Mime Ash's dad.

11:05.160 --> 11:11.420
Ever since Ash caught him in It's Mr. Mime Time, Mr. Mime AKA Mime as he's been nicknamed

11:11.420 --> 11:14.080
has been living with his mother in Pallet Town.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.080
Wow.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.400
So he's like a stepdad.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.720
It's Mr. Mime Time, huh?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.280
Well, I'll be beating off to that later.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.400
That was enlightening.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
And now...

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
You ready to get into it?

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
Let's do it.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.760
There have been Luke Luke.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.440
Hey, I'm here with Luke.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
I'm here.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.440
I'm Luke.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.440
Is Thomas here?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.440
Nope.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.440
Is Joe here?

11:34.440 --> 11:35.440
Not a chance.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.440
Is Justin here?

11:36.440 --> 11:37.440
Um...

11:37.440 --> 11:38.440
Oh, he is.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
He's hiding in the closet.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.440
That's right.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.440
Play with your keyboard.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.120
Man, let's get those tones.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
Do what?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.840
Oh, he said he's beating off to Mr. Mime.

11:47.840 --> 11:53.040
Okay, yeah, just be quiet.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.240
Just play the music again.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.520
There have been some gaps in this story.

11:58.520 --> 12:05.240
Strangely, at our table, we've always accounted for each character's time with a completionist's

12:05.240 --> 12:06.240
mindset.

12:06.240 --> 12:13.600
But there's a very specific gap that I think that we should address, and that is what did

12:13.600 --> 12:20.400
Julius Summers get up to the night of June 18th.

12:20.400 --> 12:31.280
Let's go back now to that wild night at the foundry, as a sweaty, writhing mass of interns

12:31.280 --> 12:37.120
drool chant and breathe all out of their slack-jawed maws.

12:37.120 --> 12:51.600
And the screen, once again, fades to black with the sound of shots, being slurped greedily

12:51.600 --> 12:56.600
from the now saliva-covered, bare stomach of Julius Summers.

12:56.600 --> 13:03.920
But this time, instead of cutting to the next day, let's take a look at later that night,

13:03.920 --> 13:05.440
as Julius exits.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.120
Well, I guess I should just ask you, Luke.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.160
What's up, man?

13:10.160 --> 13:14.960
How does Julius Summers exit the foundry that evening?

13:14.960 --> 13:18.400
Amongst the excitement, Julius decides to dip.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.480
One of the interns rips their shirt and throws it on the ground.

13:23.040 --> 13:29.760
Julius grabs that and cleans his stomach up a little bit, wipes some of the liquor and

13:29.760 --> 13:32.400
drool and other fluids off.

13:32.400 --> 13:39.680
And you hear the interns are like, basically, it's like ramping back up as another new

13:39.680 --> 13:48.320
initiate into the news conglomerates, foundry regulars here in the city, hops onto the bar

13:48.320 --> 13:51.040
and takes your previous position.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.440
Julius stumbles out the front door of the foundry, looks around.

13:56.080 --> 13:56.800
He's alone.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.480
It's late.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.680
The sun's down.

13:59.680 --> 14:00.880
It's not quite up yet.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.720
And he just starts walking down the road.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.240
He gets just out of eyesight of the foundry.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.600
He stands up completely straight, looks his head over to the right, opens his mouth and

14:13.600 --> 14:14.720
just vomits.

14:15.360 --> 14:21.760
But not like his body is telling him to, but like he's telling his body to.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.080
Yes.

14:22.800 --> 14:30.480
He throws up, starts walking, not stumbling at all, completely above the influence.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.400
It's a text alert.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.080
He pulls his phone out and looks.

14:34.080 --> 14:40.480
It's a text from a number that's like 62266 or something like that.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.880
And it says, it's Bernie.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.560
Yeah, exactly.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.280
It's one of those.

14:45.280 --> 14:53.040
It's like, looks like an automated text, but it just says Z, like a lowercase Z.

14:54.080 --> 15:00.560
Julius looks at it, understands, puts his phone back in his pocket and

15:00.640 --> 15:02.000
starts to jog.

15:02.720 --> 15:08.960
When he gets to the main road, he pulls his phone out and calls a car.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.520
Where does this car end up?

15:12.800 --> 15:17.760
Well, the driverless car with the giant camera on top pulls up.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.960
He gets in the back.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.680
What is that?

15:19.680 --> 15:21.440
It's like a self-driving car.

15:21.440 --> 15:21.680
Oh.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.800
You know, like the ones with the giant camera.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.840
It's like a prototype.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.920
They're running in the city.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.960
That sounds cool.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.680
He gets in that cause he doesn't want anyone to know.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.040
No, of course not.

15:33.040 --> 15:38.240
The car drives for a little while and eventually he sees off in the distance

15:39.680 --> 15:48.160
a very tall space needle shaped tower with a flashing light at the top.

15:48.160 --> 15:48.400
Yeah.

15:48.400 --> 15:58.080
Not quite fully a space needle height, but a poor attempt at the monument up there in

15:58.160 --> 16:00.080
Seattle here in the city.

16:00.080 --> 16:10.240
And as you drive up, the car stops in the parking lot where there is shit pouring down.

16:11.120 --> 16:15.120
There is a slight uneven level to this parking lot.

16:15.680 --> 16:25.840
There's one other car in this lot and it is a slick, sleek, chic, clean, black, matte

16:26.720 --> 16:30.960
Jaguar XE is the only other car.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.040
Who the fuck mows their lawn at a reasonable time of day?

16:35.040 --> 16:38.560
At 4.30 in the morning when we're recording this.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.240
Oh, that's fun.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.680
We've never dealt with that before.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.280
It's weird.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.040
Should we 30 seconds of silence just engage?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.080
I think so, yeah.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.440
Okay.

16:49.440 --> 16:49.840
All right.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.080
We'll see if that works.

16:53.040 --> 16:59.040
It's the only other car in the lot and your driverless car has now parked.

16:59.040 --> 17:04.400
Julius gets out of his car, looks over at the Jaguar, looks up at the zeitgeist.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.200
I hope the elevator is broken.

17:08.080 --> 17:14.000
And he starts heading towards the zeitgeist and he's going to run up those stairs because

17:14.000 --> 17:18.400
he knows he's going to meet somebody at the very tippy top.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.920
At the very tippy top.

17:19.920 --> 17:26.080
And as you approach, we see the lovely ground all around this area.

17:26.080 --> 17:26.640
It's lovely.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.840
Oh, it's so lovely.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.400
Untouched even, unbroken.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.160
Man, there's no holes around here.

17:32.160 --> 17:38.320
As if really no one's hung out around here, at least in a digging capacity.

17:38.960 --> 17:45.920
And you walk into a jar door at the bottom of the zeitgeist.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.200
Do you even check if the elevator is down?

17:49.200 --> 17:49.760
No.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.520
He's getting the leg workout in.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.000
And he goes up how many flights of stairs?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.200
What a rude question.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.440
Okay, you kept that.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.480
I think it was like eight.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.440
He starts running up countless flights of stairs.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.040
So many.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.400
Less than 10 probably.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.680
And once he gets, there's like one more flight of stairs.

18:11.680 --> 18:16.160
He finally maybe starts feeling a little something in his legs,

18:16.160 --> 18:20.000
but he's a little disappointed with such a meager workout.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.040
I mean, are your thighs like, do you have a chafe issue with these big boys?

18:25.040 --> 18:30.800
No, the pants that he's wearing, all his pants that he owns are specifically tailored.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.760
Reinforced.

18:31.760 --> 18:32.240
Right.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.440
To not chafe his legs because he's going to be working out.

18:36.000 --> 18:44.080
Whether it's in athletic gear or a suit, there's a high probability he'll be getting leg day in.

18:44.080 --> 18:47.440
And you open up the door into the top of the zeitgeist,

18:47.440 --> 18:52.720
this old and decrepit room in a large circle.

18:52.720 --> 18:59.840
You kind of see around the rounded corner of this kind of internal bar and the windows,

18:59.840 --> 19:03.840
some of which are no longer there around the outside.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.880
And standing and kind of up against where there was a window once.

19:09.680 --> 19:15.040
You see a woman familiar to you wearing a black suit, white shirt, black sunglasses.

19:17.040 --> 19:22.640
And a tattoo runs out of her sleeve and down her hand.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.920
It's like a scaly tail that reaches down and around.

19:28.880 --> 19:33.840
She turns holding a package in her hand that's closest toward you.

19:34.480 --> 19:38.320
Mr. Summers, you made it very quickly.

19:38.400 --> 19:44.480
Yeah, I was on my way out of initiation or whatever you want to call it.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.840
With the crew, how is that going?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.520
Exceedingly well.

19:50.240 --> 19:50.720
Good.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.000
I'm learning a lot about TV stuff.

19:56.560 --> 20:04.160
Well, as long as that TV stuff continues to carry the weight of what you texted me about earlier,

20:04.160 --> 20:06.480
the Godel farm.

20:06.480 --> 20:11.360
And I mean, do you think there's anything going on with this Kaylee Silver woman?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.400
They're trying to play it off.

20:12.400 --> 20:17.280
Like, you know, maybe she snapped or something, but there's something more to it.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.560
We'll get something soon.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.680
I can feel it.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.960
It's only been a day.

20:20.960 --> 20:27.200
I mean, I did see some farm wrestling, but other than that, nothing too crazy.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.160
She looks at you with a wry smile and is like,

20:30.160 --> 20:36.160
well, I just want you to remember that with the pressure that we're putting on the Godel company,

20:36.880 --> 20:41.680
we're going to likely have to deal with some Godel-owned pigs here in the city.

20:42.640 --> 20:47.680
And for each one that, I don't know, let's say doesn't have a job anymore,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.160
it's going to earn you quite the promotion.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.320
Let's race through the ranks.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.120
She smiles.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.560
What's in the package?

20:55.680 --> 20:56.800
Don't worry about what's in it.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.760
Needs to be delivered.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.400
7251 West Shift Street.

21:01.680 --> 21:05.600
In exchange, you'll receive a package as well.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.120
We'll be in contact when I need to retrieve it.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.480
Sounds good.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.040
Do you want me to leave first or?

21:13.680 --> 21:15.920
No, it'll take too long getting down the stairs.

21:15.920 --> 21:16.400
Let me go.

21:17.840 --> 21:22.480
And with that, Julia Summers bounds down the stairs,

21:22.480 --> 21:28.640
back out of the zeitgeist through the bit of woods down to the parking lot

21:29.920 --> 21:32.240
where the driverless car is waiting.

21:32.240 --> 21:37.520
He goes into the app and sends the car home and he's getting a run in.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.040
You pull up 7251 West Shift Street.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.560
It's like, how far would you be willing to run right now?

21:47.120 --> 21:51.440
When he pulls it up the walking direction, say two hours and 17 minutes,

21:52.800 --> 21:53.840
45 minutes.

21:53.840 --> 21:54.400
Yep.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.360
A bit out of breath.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.920
It's been a long fucking day.

21:57.920 --> 21:58.960
It's late.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.400
He's feeling like maybe a beer made it into him.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.160
And you come across this old, old house.

22:10.160 --> 22:15.440
It's seemingly like built by someone with a specific image in mind

22:15.440 --> 22:17.760
of what they wanted their home to look like.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.920
It's not like any of the other older homes in the area.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.920
A lot of ranch style houses around here.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.800
And this one is kind of a mix between that older look

22:26.800 --> 22:29.280
with almost like a modern architecture to it.

22:30.080 --> 22:35.840
The yard is absolutely filled with all sorts of oddities.

22:37.920 --> 22:43.520
Massive sculptures of birds of prey and reptiles.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.960
Other seemingly decorative objects.

22:49.360 --> 22:56.080
All of which look extremely old and handpicked.

22:57.760 --> 23:01.040
Julius doesn't really care.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.960
He's there to give and get and then get out.

23:05.760 --> 23:06.480
Where do you go?

23:06.480 --> 23:07.280
Up to the front door.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.320
Knock on the door, knock on the door.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.120
Your mailman just walked up.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.320
That's good timing.

23:18.960 --> 23:19.520
Let's get him.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.680
Do you want to be a guest?

23:25.520 --> 23:26.880
That's a scary question.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.040
Be my guest.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.920
You can, uh, you know, put our, put our service to the test.

23:35.920 --> 23:37.760
We can check him before we wreck him.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.760
Julius thinks and then laughs.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.600
David Spade.

23:47.120 --> 23:47.840
Who is it?

23:48.480 --> 23:50.800
I've got a package.

23:50.800 --> 23:57.120
The door opens and you see a man with a short beard, flannel shirt,

23:57.120 --> 23:59.120
cargo pants, rugged boots.

23:59.680 --> 24:03.360
He's got just like stained with dirt all over his shirt,

24:03.360 --> 24:09.280
all over his hands wearing a bit of like a gray brown cowboy hat.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.480
Just a bit of one apparently.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.120
He's wearing a faded gray brown cowboy hat.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.640
And you see behind him in the entryway,

24:16.640 --> 24:21.280
there is a shovel leaning up against the wall within view

24:21.280 --> 24:25.760
that is glinting in the morning light shining in through the door.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.720
He quickly takes the package from you.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.800
Julius grabs it away.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.840
You first.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.960
Oh yes, of course.

24:32.960 --> 24:37.280
My, uh, my deepest, uh, sincerest apologies.

24:37.280 --> 24:38.640
Let me grab that for you.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.800
And he closes the door.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.880
You hear a bit of a rummage.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.320
He rummages to completion.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.960
And then he comes back to the door, opens it up

24:50.960 --> 24:56.240
and hands you a bag, a tote bag.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.520
Julius grabs the bag, hands over the package

24:59.520 --> 25:02.400
and then kind of like gestures to the yard.

25:02.400 --> 25:06.480
And it's like, so like, what's, uh, what's all that?

25:06.480 --> 25:08.240
Oh, do you enjoy the pieces?

25:09.040 --> 25:10.160
They're interesting.

25:10.160 --> 25:10.720
Yes.

25:10.720 --> 25:10.960
Yes.

25:10.960 --> 25:16.800
I, uh, I, every single time I drive back or leave my home,

25:16.800 --> 25:21.760
I get to look at them and be reminded of all the wonderful things.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.560
He gets an off distance look.

25:24.560 --> 25:32.560
He's gone in the, in the sunrise as he's off on my mini expeditions.

25:32.560 --> 25:37.360
But Julius looks down at his watch and back up at this guy.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.120
And he's still smiling.

25:39.280 --> 25:43.520
He nods his head and, uh, is gonna head out.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.840
Yes, have an excellent morning, sir.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.120
Julius is going to walk away and, uh, he's going to look in the bag.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.200
Oh, he looks in the bag?

25:53.200 --> 25:53.440
Yeah.

25:53.440 --> 25:58.160
Since if it was a package, he was going to not unwrap it, but it's in a bag.

25:58.160 --> 25:58.960
He's going to look.

25:58.960 --> 25:59.200
Yeah.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.320
There's a piece of parchment.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.480
He's going to read it.

26:02.480 --> 26:13.120
Uh, it is this parchment that has a language on it that you've never seen before.

26:13.760 --> 26:17.280
And do you have any skills?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.400
I guess I need my character sheet.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.040
Okay.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.240
Do I have any skills?

26:26.240 --> 26:26.640
I do.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.200
What specifically?

26:29.280 --> 26:38.000
I'm looking for a SIGINT or a specific language or archeology, history.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.120
Julius has a 70 SIGINT.

26:41.120 --> 26:43.680
Oh, oh, does he?

26:43.680 --> 26:44.240
Interesting.

26:44.240 --> 26:44.720
Okay.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.480
Uh, and with this, uh, 70 SIGINT, let's roll baby.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.400
61 on a 70.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.800
61 on a 70.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.520
It tells you two things.

26:58.240 --> 27:06.880
One, this is a stone rubbing and two, you've never seen this language before, but you think

27:06.880 --> 27:10.320
you might know someone who can help you out with it.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.640
Julius makes a note of it.

27:14.640 --> 27:21.280
In fact, he takes a picture of it on his phone, puts it back in the bag, kind of how it was.

27:22.080 --> 27:26.320
And then, um, Julius is going to jog home.

27:27.520 --> 27:32.000
He can leave it on the kitchen counter for his handler, who is his roommate.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.000
Let's go now to July 6th.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.200
Let's pick up exactly where we were with Julius Summers.

27:45.200 --> 27:52.800
As you walked up through the hall, the Cannes studio, you hear Tife whistling.

27:57.520 --> 28:05.280
You open up the door and you see your uncle Tife Raylan standing behind his desk.

28:05.280 --> 28:10.800
And you see two other people sitting at chairs on either side, closer to you.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.200
Both kind of turned back looking at you.

28:13.200 --> 28:19.040
You see cops, one tall kind of spindly, one short ball jacked.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.720
And they all look at you.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.120
Julius fucking my baby boy.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.160
What's up, Neff?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.200
How's it going?

28:27.520 --> 28:28.640
How you living?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.400
Oh, forget about it.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.320
Come hungry for you.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.800
We got some stuff we need to take care of.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.520
Where's your boys?

28:35.520 --> 28:36.160
Where's Beck?

28:36.160 --> 28:36.800
Where's Cal?

28:37.360 --> 28:39.680
I'm the only one that's going to be here.

28:39.680 --> 28:40.720
Why is that?

28:40.720 --> 28:44.400
I thought I told you to bring the whole team down, baby.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.600
They're not going to do what you want them to do.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.160
And what is that that I want them to do?

28:50.160 --> 28:52.000
Give up on the Godel company.

28:52.000 --> 28:52.640
Give up?

28:53.680 --> 28:54.320
Give up?

28:54.320 --> 28:56.080
No, no, absolutely.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.320
I would never give up on the Godel company.

28:58.320 --> 29:04.480
And you see Officer Riley and Officer Wiley sitting in these chairs, smiling real big,

29:04.480 --> 29:06.400
kind of laughing to themselves.

29:07.200 --> 29:11.520
No, no, we are absolutely not giving up on the Godel company.

29:11.520 --> 29:16.400
The Godel company is what's taking us into the future, baby boy.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.200
Come on, Neff.

29:17.200 --> 29:17.840
Come on.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.400
Let's go.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.240
Let's go.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.920
It's promotion time.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.920
Now, you have some videos on your phone, I believe, Julius.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.640
Photos, videos, stuff like that.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.280
Yeah.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.400
Let's see that phone.

29:31.360 --> 29:36.080
Before I show you any of this, I, you know, I have some demands.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.440
Okay.

29:37.440 --> 29:37.840
Okay.

29:37.840 --> 29:38.400
Calm down.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.960
Demands of one thing, requests or another for our new promotion man.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.000
Okay.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.760
Well, and Julius reaches into his pocket and pulls out a list that is written on a napkin

29:51.760 --> 29:53.360
from where are we?

29:53.360 --> 29:56.080
We're at the kids bar.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.760
I need a personal assistant.

29:59.760 --> 30:08.400
And I want a fully catered breakfast buffet every day from the day goal for the whole

30:08.400 --> 30:08.800
staff.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.480
Interesting.

30:10.480 --> 30:10.880
Wow.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.840
That's a weird one.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.200
I'm not done.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.880
I want your, I want your private executive bathroom.

30:17.600 --> 30:21.120
Oh, come in, come in.

30:21.760 --> 30:26.640
And I want you to pay for it to get remodeled by the team at Bedeagle.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.120
I want full control of what gets played on can.

30:32.160 --> 30:32.960
Wow.

30:32.960 --> 30:33.840
That's a big one.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.560
I want Cal to be the lead anchor.

30:36.560 --> 30:36.880
Okay.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.800
That's kind of doable more so.

30:38.800 --> 30:44.240
I want Beck to get any equipment or really anything that he asked for.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.640
Yeah, to a certain monetary amount.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.200
Sure.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.480
I want the title of executive producer.

30:50.480 --> 30:50.880
Okay.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.600
I want a free pass from all the cops.

30:55.600 --> 31:04.000
Um, the, the, the short jacked one immediately stands up with like almost bald fists and

31:04.000 --> 31:07.520
is like, um, uh, sorry, sorry.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.720
Um, what did you just say?

31:10.720 --> 31:12.880
I don't want to get pulled over for speeding.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.080
Oh, okay.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.160
Um, no speeding is fine.

31:20.160 --> 31:20.960
Fine, fine.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.440
Sure.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.040
But what did you call us just then?

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
Was it cops, right?

31:27.040 --> 31:29.680
I said the cops, city PD.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.400
Julia starts to sweat a little bit.

31:32.400 --> 31:38.400
He slowly kind of sits back down and says, uh, yeah, that's what I fucking thought.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.600
Uh, I, I want hush money.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.840
I want them to pay me not to show this.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.960
How much, how much do they pay you money?

31:48.960 --> 31:50.080
No, no, no.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.760
I'm not in it for the money, dude.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.480
Come on, man.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.760
This is, this is the future.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.320
Julius.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.400
We're talking about a whole new world, man.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.560
We're talking about a million dollars.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.680
I mean a bonus, a signing bonus.

32:01.680 --> 32:02.960
Is that what we'll talk about it later?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.560
We'll get the details down later.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.280
Now, listen, this is important.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.320
This is an important one.

32:08.320 --> 32:14.160
I want a Tony little's gazelle freestyle glider home fitness exercise machine with the workout

32:15.040 --> 32:16.080
DVD in my office.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.400
Is that like hard to find?

32:18.400 --> 32:18.880
I don't know.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.200
I remembered it and it's good for your thighs.

32:25.280 --> 32:25.600
Okay.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.320
I'm almost done.

32:28.800 --> 32:33.280
I want to travel and fitness show that runs after the five o'clock news.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.200
And I want to call it summer's vacation.

32:37.440 --> 32:42.080
He laughs like I just laughed at that one and is like, that actually sounds like a great

32:42.080 --> 32:43.440
pitch and we can at least.

32:43.440 --> 32:43.840
Yay.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.520
We can talk about that for sure.

32:45.520 --> 32:45.920
Okay.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.960
And then this one, I will not concede on this one.

32:48.960 --> 32:54.880
I want the marbles re-installed in the walkway of the entrance and he pulls out a marble

32:54.880 --> 32:56.160
from his little pocket.

32:56.160 --> 32:56.640
Of course.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.040
Yeah.

32:57.040 --> 33:01.600
And he flicks it over towards one of the gobs.

33:01.600 --> 33:06.160
The tall spindly one kind of catches it as he's reaching out to catch it.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.560
Julius pulls out two pistols.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.120
Oh my God.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.120
Oh my God.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.560
And shoots at both of the gobs.

33:14.560 --> 33:15.280
Oh my God.

33:15.280 --> 33:15.840
Okay.

33:15.840 --> 33:16.320
Shit.

33:16.320 --> 33:16.640
Fuck.

33:16.640 --> 33:21.120
What's your, what's your, uh, what's your dexterity?

33:21.120 --> 33:22.880
My dexterity is 75.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.440
Okay.

33:23.440 --> 33:23.920
Yes.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.000
You also caught him by surprise.

33:26.000 --> 33:32.560
So you get to go first and that is after your surprise round.

33:32.560 --> 33:36.560
So let's start with a deeply surprising round.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.720
That's a five, that's a five.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.240
Okay.

33:46.240 --> 33:46.720
All right.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.200
Roll a d10 for each of the shots.

33:49.920 --> 33:50.800
Gets these two dudes.

33:51.600 --> 33:52.800
A two and a 10.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.880
A two and a 10.

33:54.880 --> 33:55.600
Okay.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.160
You flick this marble in the air.

33:58.160 --> 34:04.080
Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly cop reaches up to grab it and you fire directly through

34:04.080 --> 34:07.920
his hand with one of your shots as the other one.

34:07.920 --> 34:14.560
Hits the marble, which embeds itself directly between the other guy's eyes.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.040
Yup.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.640
And he has to roll constitution.

34:18.640 --> 34:24.880
He does stay conscious, uh, but he's lying flat on the ground at this point.

34:24.880 --> 34:33.360
Blood is like spraying out around where the marble has embedded itself and type is freaking

34:33.360 --> 34:35.280
the absolute fuck out.

34:35.280 --> 34:44.080
But Wilson Wiley immediately dives for cover behind the desk with Tife and flips it on

34:44.080 --> 34:44.640
its side.

34:45.440 --> 34:53.920
Tife's enormous solid wooden desk is now in between you and Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly

34:53.920 --> 35:01.440
cop and Tife Rayland, your uncle, while Richard Riley lays on the floor.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.680
Tife yells out to you with his turn.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.520
Come on, Julius.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.200
What the fuck?

35:09.200 --> 35:11.840
I ain't going back to Barstow.

35:12.480 --> 35:16.800
And with that, it's Richard Riley's turn and on the ground.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.240
He moans back up to the top of the order.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.280
It's your turn.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.920
Tife, if you're not armed, you better not arm yourself.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.280
This is not over.

35:25.280 --> 35:29.920
And then he starts running towards the desk towards Wilson.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.520
And he wants to, in his mind, he's going to hop the desk, catch Wilson's head between

35:35.520 --> 35:41.040
his legs, spin, and then land on the ground with his gun aimed at Tife.

35:41.040 --> 35:41.600
Okay.

35:41.600 --> 35:47.440
You were super close, so this is just going to be a melee attack, but I need you to roll

35:47.440 --> 35:51.520
an athletics first to successfully dive over the desk.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.020
Uh-oh.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.160
I rolled a 90.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.960
90 is not going to do it.

36:00.960 --> 36:07.680
So as you're running up, Wilson Wiley just kind of stands at the last possible moment,

36:07.680 --> 36:09.600
throws his hands up as kind of a block.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.640
His hands are the only thing up above.

36:12.640 --> 36:18.640
And so they're kind of grabbing on either side of the inner thighs and just kind of

36:18.640 --> 36:20.160
like holds you right there.

36:20.160 --> 36:24.240
And you're like sitting on top of the desk at this point in time.

36:24.320 --> 36:28.640
And the two of you are grappling each other, essentially at this point.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.920
And it's Tife's turn.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.680
You can now see him as you're looking down directly at him.

36:33.680 --> 36:38.800
And he just kind of sits back and he's like, I don't have a fucking gun, Julius.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.480
What the fuck, man?

36:40.480 --> 36:41.280
I'm not going to-

36:41.280 --> 36:42.080
Good.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.440
Yeah, duh.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.920
And it's Richard Riley's turn.

36:45.920 --> 36:52.960
You hear just kind of this like, ugh, and he's slowly getting himself off the ground

36:52.960 --> 36:58.240
behind you, but that's going to take his entire turn to just kind of like right himself at

36:58.240 --> 36:58.880
this point.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.240
And it's back to you.

37:00.240 --> 37:07.360
So Julius is sitting on the overturned desk with Wilson's hands basically clenched between

37:07.360 --> 37:08.240
his legs.

37:08.240 --> 37:08.740
Yeah.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.920
He's going to shoot Wilson right in the face.

37:11.920 --> 37:12.640
Jesus Christ.

37:14.240 --> 37:20.960
Okay, so because you're within distance of him, he's going to roll unarmed combat against

37:20.960 --> 37:21.840
your firearms.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.340
Okay.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.440
I got a 19.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.960
I failed with a 77.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.080
Oh, so-

37:30.080 --> 37:31.680
So how do you execute this man?

37:33.840 --> 37:39.520
Julius is sitting on the overturned desk with Wilson's hands clenched between his thighs.

37:40.880 --> 37:45.120
Julius spreads his legs, lets Wilson's hands free.

37:46.240 --> 37:48.160
Julius is like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.480
And then just shoots him right between the eyes.

37:50.480 --> 37:56.080
He's literally like fumbling for his gun and can't get it out of his holster.

37:56.080 --> 38:03.440
And as you're firing, he's like, and his gun goes off as well.

38:04.160 --> 38:13.200
Typh is there with a bullet through his shin and he's like, whoa, no, what the-

38:13.200 --> 38:15.040
Oh my God, he's dead.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.080
Oh, he's fucking-

38:17.040 --> 38:19.600
As he's throwing up, he's about to pass out.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.240
And he's like, I'm about to pass out, man.

38:24.880 --> 38:32.800
Yet he just continues to vomit as Richard Riley is finally standing, slowly looking

38:32.800 --> 38:38.000
up with you just executing his partner.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.720
That's probably good, right?

38:40.720 --> 38:41.600
For him?

38:41.600 --> 38:42.720
He fires at you.

38:46.480 --> 38:52.480
And he puts a bullet right into your shoulder for three points of damage.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.920
How many hit points do you have?

38:53.920 --> 38:55.200
I was at six.

38:55.200 --> 38:55.760
Oh, God.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.360
So yeah, he is down to three hit points and it hurts.

39:03.440 --> 39:09.040
With that, you need to roll a constitution check in order to stay conscious as you take

39:09.040 --> 39:14.240
half of the hit points in damage that you currently have.

39:14.240 --> 39:20.320
With a 24, you stay with it and it is your turn once again.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.760
This dude behind you has just shot you through the shoulder.

39:24.560 --> 39:29.200
There's a dead man in front of you and Typh is puking his brains out with a hole in his

39:29.200 --> 39:30.480
shin to the left of you.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.240
As soon as Julius gets shot.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.840
God damn it.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.240
I thought you're fucking dead.

39:37.200 --> 39:42.480
You turn around and you see a dude with a marble deeply embedded, so deeply that if

39:42.480 --> 39:49.520
you miniaturized yourself to the point to where each hair on an eyebrow was the same

39:49.520 --> 39:55.120
height as you and then you walked across his forehead, you would have no trouble traversing

39:55.120 --> 39:55.760
the terrain.

40:00.080 --> 40:04.400
Julius looks at the guy who just shot him, looks over at his uncle.

40:05.280 --> 40:05.840
Fuck.

40:06.000 --> 40:14.240
And he walks up to Richard Riley and is going to just try to punch the marble into his brain.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.360
Finish what he started.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.760
Okay, so he's going to put up a fight here.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.080
We're going unarmed combat against each other.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.960
He succeeds with an ought six.

40:26.640 --> 40:27.440
83.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.040
Oh shit.

40:29.040 --> 40:29.200
Okay.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.480
With one arm.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.040
I mean, he got shot through the left shoulder.

40:33.040 --> 40:36.240
He rolls a two, so that's only one point of damage.

40:36.880 --> 40:42.960
As you go to punch him, he just grabs your arm, kind of throws you back and throws a

40:42.960 --> 40:44.800
left hook at you at the same time.

40:45.680 --> 40:52.640
Your nose has recently been like completely obliterated and then healed by some sort of

40:52.640 --> 40:53.440
wild tech.

40:54.240 --> 41:01.520
You immediately feel your nose kind of like bust back open as you go to two hit points.

41:01.520 --> 41:06.880
You once again have to roll a constitution check to stay conscious as the world around

41:06.880 --> 41:11.200
you vibrates and your stomach just nope.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.480
The vibration is gone.

41:12.480 --> 41:19.520
Your stomach feels like fucking steel and you've never, ever been more focused.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.320
Crit success.

41:20.880 --> 41:21.920
Your turn.

41:21.920 --> 41:22.720
Let's go.

41:22.720 --> 41:23.520
Julius shoots him.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.320
He gets punched in the face.

41:26.880 --> 41:33.920
No thoughts go through his mind other than this has to end and he just unloads his clip

41:33.920 --> 41:34.960
into this guy.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.360
Okay.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.960
We're on against each other once again.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.960
59, which is a pass.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.960
26, which is a pass.

41:44.160 --> 41:52.000
And as you both go for your guns at the exact same time, you kill him, your back is up

41:52.000 --> 41:52.560
against the wall.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.760
It's unceremonious.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.560
You wanted to do the fun marble thing in your mind.

41:56.560 --> 42:01.440
You're like still bummed that you didn't quite finish him off in that way, but you

42:01.440 --> 42:03.360
know, you were about to fucking die.

42:03.360 --> 42:03.860
Yeah.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.280
Julius's vision is kind of tunneling in a little bit.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.640
He's losing some blood.

42:09.280 --> 42:16.960
His face is on fire from his re-broken nose and who knows probably facial bones as well.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.200
Julius walks over to type.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.840
Oh, what the fuck, Julius?

42:27.840 --> 42:29.840
Julius, seriously, you can't.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.920
We were onto something, Julius.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.080
We were, we were onto something.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.800
What you want and what I want.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.440
I don't match up.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.840
I have one more thing on my list of demands.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.080
Whatever you want.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.440
Whatever you want, Julius.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.960
Whatever you want is yours.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.320
Tell me I'm a real Raylan.

42:51.680 --> 42:53.120
I'm a real Raylan?

42:53.120 --> 42:55.120
No, you're not a fucking Raylan.

42:55.120 --> 42:59.840
A Raylan wouldn't shoot anybody with his cold blood like this coming in my office shooting

42:59.840 --> 43:00.240
cops.

43:01.280 --> 43:01.840
What is it?

43:01.840 --> 43:04.240
Why am I going to have to call the police?

43:04.240 --> 43:06.080
Everything's fucked now, man.

43:06.080 --> 43:06.960
Everything's fucked.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.400
You fucking ruined everything.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.000
You fucking ruined everything.

43:10.720 --> 43:17.520
Julius holsters the gun that he emptied the clip on, pulls out the one that he still has

43:17.520 --> 43:21.360
bullets in, puts it up against type's head.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.400
Are you fucking serious?

43:22.400 --> 43:24.560
Tell me I'm a real Julius.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.600
Tell me I'm a Raylan.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.360
Is that what this is about?

43:27.360 --> 43:29.280
Tell me I'm a fucking Raylan.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.760
You've lost your grip is what, Julius.

43:31.760 --> 43:36.480
Tear runs down Julius's face as he pulls the trigger.

43:38.000 --> 43:44.560
The body of Typh Raylan slumps down into a pile of his own vomit.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.840
Immediately, the body of Wilson Wiley farts.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.480
God damn it.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.560
I'll never get used to this stench of death.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.120
Roll grip.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.000
No, that's not going to do it.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.840
That's an 89 on a 25.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.400
For murdering unarmed family member.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.920
I'm going to go ahead and say D4 plus one.

44:23.920 --> 44:24.420
Yeah.

44:26.640 --> 44:27.440
One plus one.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.240
Two grip.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.560
And that puts me past a breaking point.

44:30.560 --> 44:31.840
Hey, that's fitting.

44:34.400 --> 44:35.200
What should we go with?

44:35.840 --> 44:39.760
We've got a fucking mess is the situation that you're in.

44:40.720 --> 44:41.760
It's a giant mess.

44:41.760 --> 44:47.440
Julius just killed his uncle who, you know, whether they got along, he still killed his

44:47.440 --> 44:48.560
uncle that he loved.

44:49.120 --> 44:58.000
And so Julius, instead of dealing with the horrific situation in front of him, goes somewhere

44:58.000 --> 44:58.500
else.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.080
Just leaves?

45:00.080 --> 45:02.240
No, in his mind.

45:02.880 --> 45:03.680
Oh shit.

45:04.320 --> 45:08.160
He doesn't see the dead body of Typh Raylan.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.400
He doesn't see two dead cops.

45:12.640 --> 45:18.160
He sees interesting little figurines reminiscent of-

45:18.160 --> 45:20.720
The sculptures from the front yard.

45:22.880 --> 45:23.920
And the vomit.

45:23.920 --> 45:24.880
A water feature.

45:24.880 --> 45:25.380
Of course.

45:26.080 --> 45:26.880
The blood.

45:26.880 --> 45:27.600
A little pond.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.920
He sees little koi fish swimming in it.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.760
Oh, Typh wouldn't like this.

45:35.760 --> 45:36.880
Oh no, no.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.000
He likes it a lot neater.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.640
I gotta get this stuff out of here before he sees it.

45:40.640 --> 45:49.440
And Julius starts cleaning up the office to get out the sculptures.

45:50.800 --> 45:57.120
All right, roll forensics to clean up the murder scene that you just created.

45:59.200 --> 45:59.920
An 81.

46:00.720 --> 46:01.920
So that's not gonna cut it.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.440
That's not gonna cut it.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.560
That's not gonna do it.

46:05.600 --> 46:09.280
You've gotten the sculptures where?

46:09.440 --> 46:11.360
How are you getting rid of these sculptures?

46:11.360 --> 46:12.960
Are they in the bathroom?

46:12.960 --> 46:14.240
The executive bathroom?

46:14.240 --> 46:15.440
They're in a-

46:15.440 --> 46:17.760
Well, Typh has his closet-

46:17.760 --> 46:18.320
Shower.

46:18.320 --> 46:24.720
Well, Typh in the office has his closet full of suits in case he needs to change for a

46:24.720 --> 46:27.360
different occasion or if he works late.

46:27.360 --> 46:32.720
So Julius gets the sculptures and puts them in the shed.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.260
Yep.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.640
Which is the closet there.

46:36.640 --> 46:37.040
Yep.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.640
He kind of likes the water features.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.760
He thinks maybe they're not too bad, so he leaves those.

46:42.960 --> 46:46.400
Plus he doesn't know how he's gonna fill it in or something.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.440
Yeah, it's too much.

46:48.160 --> 46:52.080
Julius, he wants to meet back up with his friends, honestly.

46:52.080 --> 46:52.960
He's had a hard day.

46:54.000 --> 47:01.200
Julius walks out of the office confident that he's at least gotten rid of the sculptures

47:01.200 --> 47:06.080
that some people might think are a little gaudy or ugly, but they're hidden away in

47:06.080 --> 47:06.960
the shed.

47:06.960 --> 47:15.360
He walks out of the office, goes downstairs, and then once he sees the marble entrance

47:15.360 --> 47:16.560
without the marbles-

47:16.560 --> 47:17.280
Yeah.

47:17.280 --> 47:18.960
He kind of comes back to-

47:18.960 --> 47:20.240
You hear a voice from behind you.

47:24.320 --> 47:24.820
Julius?

47:25.680 --> 47:26.240
Julius?

47:26.240 --> 47:28.800
And you turn around and it's the intern.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.720
Can I get you a coffee or anything?

47:36.960 --> 47:40.480
Can you drive me to the Natcher Hole?

47:44.960 --> 47:46.080
Okay, where's your car?

47:49.360 --> 47:51.200
Roll Persuade.

47:54.640 --> 47:56.240
41 on a 60.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.640
He fails deeply and he's just like,

47:59.440 --> 48:03.600
Oh, oh, fuck, okay, okay, fuck.

48:03.600 --> 48:11.200
All right, and he turns around and you see kind of the office has a mass all kind of

48:11.200 --> 48:13.200
in hushed tones speaking to each other.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.400
People are on their phones.

48:14.400 --> 48:22.320
People are taking pictures and video as Jeremy kind of walks toward you nervously looking

48:22.320 --> 48:23.280
back at everyone.

48:24.800 --> 48:27.600
Okay, okay, we're going to the Natcher Hole.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.640
All right, see you guys.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.560
Let's go you.

48:34.960 --> 48:35.460
Yeah.

48:44.480 --> 48:45.040
Stevie!

48:45.040 --> 48:46.000
Stevie!

48:46.000 --> 48:46.480
Over here!

48:46.480 --> 48:47.280
It's us!

48:47.280 --> 48:47.920
It's us!

48:47.920 --> 48:48.960
It's Cal Colorado!

48:48.960 --> 48:55.200
Cal Colorado and Beck Wilder, the two of you are in Cal's vehicle, which is a-

48:55.840 --> 48:57.280
Sweet Mercedes C-Class.

48:57.280 --> 49:01.920
And you are sitting at the northeast corner of-

49:01.920 --> 49:03.200
The Natcher Hole.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.320
Oh, look at that.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.880
I pointed at each of them and they were like,

49:06.880 --> 49:10.400
Hey, I just took notes on this actually.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.320
30 more seconds to silence.

49:19.360 --> 49:22.240
I was going to comment that your house is so perfectly still.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.800
Like that was a real silent silence.

49:24.800 --> 49:25.200
Thank you.

49:25.920 --> 49:32.240
I mean, if we heard it shift like the foundation or something, like during the 30 seconds of

49:32.240 --> 49:34.480
silence, that would be very unsettling.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.360
I don't know why I was just like, Oh, you're probably wrong.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.160
Well, that's kind of our thing, right?

49:42.800 --> 49:44.240
We're supposed to be at the south gate.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.640
Are we parked at the northwest corner?

49:47.920 --> 49:51.760
My notes say northeast side of the Natcher Hole.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.440
What south gate are you talking about?

49:53.440 --> 49:54.880
SG, the Natcher Hole.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.560
SG, we think, is for Stevie Gotel.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.240
Well, now that we've seen her-

50:00.240 --> 50:02.400
I was going to say, it's been a while.

50:02.400 --> 50:04.240
Scratch, scratch, scratch all that.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.320
Yeah, that's the part where I look dumb.

50:07.200 --> 50:07.760
That's fair.

50:10.080 --> 50:10.640
I do that for me.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.120
To be fair, the Natcher Hole used to be a stadium.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.320
So having a south gate isn't the most ridiculous thing.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.280
No, it's absolutely not.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.920
Let's go back to what Thomas said.

50:25.040 --> 50:26.160
Let's go to the south gate.

50:26.800 --> 50:30.160
I used to work at a church called South Gate.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.880
Oh, this is probably pretty triggering for you.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.320
Yeah, I was the janitor.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.360
That sounds like a nice job.

50:35.360 --> 50:37.680
It was lovely as the nighttime janitor.

50:37.680 --> 50:38.960
Yeah, nobody's around.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.400
You're in a neat big building.

50:40.400 --> 50:43.680
I was also like solidifying my lack of faith at that point.

50:43.680 --> 50:46.720
So it was a nice setting.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.480
Did you just piss on the pews and be like,

50:48.480 --> 50:50.240
well, they were clean when I got done with them.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.280
Did you play the organ?

50:52.400 --> 50:54.000
There was no organ, unfortunately.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.480
I grew up in a church with an organ.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.480
Very fun, but not that one.

50:58.480 --> 50:58.980
Bummer.

51:00.160 --> 51:01.200
You want to call for Stevie?

51:01.200 --> 51:01.700
Stevie!

51:03.360 --> 51:04.640
Stevie, Stevie!

51:04.640 --> 51:05.200
Stevie!

51:05.200 --> 51:06.000
Stevie!

51:06.000 --> 51:06.400
Stevie!

51:06.400 --> 51:07.200
It's us!

51:07.200 --> 51:07.920
Hey, hey!

51:07.920 --> 51:09.200
Cal Colorado!

51:09.200 --> 51:11.600
You guys are at the northeast corner of the Natcher Hole.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.520
Exactly where we're supposed to be.

51:13.520 --> 51:13.840
Exactly.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.400
To catch the crooked cops.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.560
Got all cops.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.480
You saw Stevie, this scrawny little dude

51:20.560 --> 51:24.720
wearing cigarette legged jeans and an oversized black hoodie.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.000
They have earbuds plugged into their ear holes

51:28.000 --> 51:33.040
and a thick wall of dark wavy hair covers their eyes, nose, and top lip,

51:33.040 --> 51:38.640
only revealing a black lipstick covered bottom lip, pierced with a small hoop.

51:38.640 --> 51:42.720
It's a good thing our trusted comrade and colleague Stevie Gotel is here

51:42.720 --> 51:47.120
to help us apprehend these men who are meeting the mysterious and criminal SG.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.400
The SG, yep.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.800
As written down in their notes.

51:53.120 --> 51:57.280
Beck, I'm so glad Stevie's here to help us find the nefarious SG.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.200
I thought that meant South Gate.

51:59.200 --> 52:00.960
I did too, to be honest.

52:00.960 --> 52:05.600
I have many fond memories of coming to this Natcher Hole with my father.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.600
We'd always come in the South Gate, the people's gate.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.880
He insisted we sit in the bleachers.

52:11.680 --> 52:14.320
I wasn't around when it was still a ballpark.

52:14.320 --> 52:18.320
I was actually at the game where the sinkhole ate Lefty Rodriguez.

52:19.360 --> 52:20.640
Well, he wasn't very good.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.000
He insisted on batting right.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.440
If you could both roll at a negative...

52:32.880 --> 52:35.840
Well, I'll just give you a negative 20 for the conversation that you're having.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.120
I fail.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.000
I crit fail.

52:43.840 --> 52:44.640
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.320
Stevie, Stevie, where did they go?

52:47.040 --> 52:47.840
Oh, shit.

52:49.680 --> 52:50.240
Stevie?

52:51.360 --> 52:51.920
Stevie?

52:51.920 --> 53:00.480
As you're looking around, Cal, you look out of the driver's side window and you see that there is

53:01.280 --> 53:09.120
blood on the street next to your car and then it's going in a line back around.

53:09.120 --> 53:13.440
And then at that very moment, you see Stevie coming back around the front of the car

53:14.160 --> 53:20.080
with some sort of contraption in their hand and they are spilling out blood.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.200
They finally connect the circle.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.240
Oh, I hate blood.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.240
I slam on the gas.

53:33.920 --> 53:36.240
You described her making the circle for too long.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.600
I'm just gonna sit here and let you trap me?

53:42.240 --> 53:46.000
Well, I mean, I am going to finish what I was doing because you failed.

53:46.560 --> 53:47.200
You check.

53:49.440 --> 53:57.840
And so Stevie is muttering something under their breath and as you go to hit the gas

53:57.840 --> 54:04.320
and the blood finally meets back up around this Cadillac, I need you both to roll power.

54:08.560 --> 54:09.600
Critical success.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.280
33 on a 60.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.640
I pass a 30 on a 75.

54:17.440 --> 54:23.920
Immediately, the two of you are standing in front of a large estate.

54:24.560 --> 54:31.280
You're standing on a sort of synthetic, almost bouncy material, like a sidewalk.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.520
And there's a row of homes in front of you.

54:35.520 --> 54:41.040
And one of these homes is slightly larger, slightly nicer than the rest.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.200
Absolutely gorgeous architecture.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.760
Well kept garden.

54:45.760 --> 54:46.480
Well kept.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.280
What's the first thing that goes through Cal Colorado's mind?

54:55.280 --> 54:55.920
Oh my God.

54:55.920 --> 54:56.560
What the fuck?

54:58.560 --> 55:05.040
And in that moment, as you speak with each word that comes out of your mouth,

55:05.040 --> 55:11.440
the reality around you sort of loses its shimmer, loses its sharpness.

55:12.400 --> 55:17.680
It's almost like you're speaking away the reality that you're currently in.

55:17.680 --> 55:18.560
This isn't happening.

55:18.560 --> 55:19.440
This isn't happening.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.720
I'm in my C class.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.920
I'm in my C class.

55:21.920 --> 55:22.960
That's where I am.

55:22.960 --> 55:27.120
And as you say that, you are sitting in your C class.

55:27.120 --> 55:33.120
You're looking over at Beck and Beck's eyes are kind of like rolled back in his head.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.240
I started slapping him.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.640
Beck Wilder, you feel the slaps?

55:37.360 --> 55:38.800
Beck, Beck, come back.

55:38.800 --> 55:39.200
Come back.

55:39.840 --> 55:41.120
You're in the C class.

55:41.120 --> 55:43.040
I'm in the C class.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.520
You are Beck Wilder.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.640
I'm Beck Wilder.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.800
The best damn camera man in the world.

55:48.800 --> 55:51.040
I'm the best camera man in the world.

55:52.400 --> 55:52.960
What the fuck?

55:53.680 --> 55:54.960
Is Stevie still around?

55:54.960 --> 56:00.480
In the rear view mirror, you see Stevie Gautilus slipped into the back seat of the Cadillac,

56:00.480 --> 56:02.080
seemingly while you were out.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.760
However, they are out currently.

56:06.640 --> 56:11.760
Eyes kind of rolled back, but like they might come to at any moment.

56:12.400 --> 56:12.900
Stevie?

56:13.920 --> 56:14.420
Stevie?

56:15.600 --> 56:16.160
Cal, hit her.

56:16.160 --> 56:22.880
I open my driver's side door and I pour my coffee out on part of the blood circle and

56:22.880 --> 56:25.760
try to disperse, like make it no longer complete circle.

56:25.760 --> 56:26.160
Cool.

56:26.160 --> 56:26.880
Very nice.

56:26.880 --> 56:29.920
As you do so, Stevie kind of like rouses.

56:29.920 --> 56:37.200
Hey, Stevie, what the fuck?

56:38.800 --> 56:40.240
What did you just do to us?

56:40.240 --> 56:40.960
That's fair.

56:42.720 --> 56:43.200
What's up?

56:44.960 --> 56:52.080
Stevie, I don't like to speak harshly to the people that I work with, but you are rapidly

56:52.080 --> 56:55.440
declining on my list of favorite can interns.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.200
Why don't you tell us what's up?

56:57.200 --> 56:58.000
Yeah.

56:58.000 --> 56:58.500
Yeah.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.200
Stevie, where's Fox?

57:03.200 --> 57:03.920
I don't know.

57:04.640 --> 57:06.800
I mean, you saw the news, right?

57:07.440 --> 57:08.720
Did you take him to the bridge?

57:08.720 --> 57:10.960
No, I didn't take him to the bridge.

57:10.960 --> 57:12.400
Like that's not Fox.

57:12.400 --> 57:16.160
Like that thing just like, I mean, now that it-

57:16.160 --> 57:19.840
You admit though that you blew the plant because we were supposed to keep him tied up down

57:19.840 --> 57:21.680
there and we could tell that you let him loose.

57:21.680 --> 57:28.160
I thought I could, I mean, clearly I'm not as good at it as my dad is.

57:29.920 --> 57:30.640
Fuck.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.200
That was Grover's Gorge that we saw, wasn't it?

57:33.200 --> 57:37.040
Oh, were you in there for a second?

57:37.040 --> 57:37.540
Yes.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.520
And it was Grover's Gorge.

57:39.520 --> 57:40.720
Was it my house?

57:40.720 --> 57:44.400
Well, I don't think we visited your house, Stevie, but it was a nice house.

57:45.280 --> 57:45.780
Yeah.

57:46.480 --> 57:48.080
Those damn bouncy sidewalks.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.440
Was that your house?

57:49.440 --> 57:49.680
Yeah.

57:49.680 --> 57:51.360
I mean, it was probably my house.

57:51.360 --> 57:52.880
It's like where it was going to start.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.000
Stevie, why did you do this?

57:54.000 --> 57:56.160
Did you know a place like home us?

57:56.160 --> 57:58.640
Well, I mean, no, it's like in your-

57:58.640 --> 58:00.560
That's one of my favorite movies, Stevie.

58:01.120 --> 58:04.800
I would appreciate it if you didn't give it negative connotations from me.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.000
If I could try, I mean, honestly, if I could do it again, that would be-

58:10.240 --> 58:12.800
I think you guys would maybe like-

58:12.800 --> 58:14.720
No, I don't think so, Stevie.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.200
They want us like dead there, right?

58:17.200 --> 58:18.720
Like we escaped a trial.

58:18.720 --> 58:19.680
Like you weren't there.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.040
You were just there in your brain.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.080
Like we all got out together and like I know that I bailed

58:26.080 --> 58:28.800
and I'm really sorry about that, but I-

58:28.800 --> 58:29.920
So what, Stevie?

58:29.920 --> 58:35.760
We spend the rest of our lives in this parking lot, imagining ourselves in Grover's Gorge?

58:35.760 --> 58:36.080
Okay.

58:36.080 --> 58:42.080
So like it's a little confusing, but mostly I'm just scared right now, honestly,

58:42.080 --> 58:45.680
because there's some shit going down.

58:45.680 --> 58:45.920
Yeah.

58:45.920 --> 58:48.080
Clearly you could handle it yourself, Stevie.

58:48.080 --> 58:54.880
Why don't you tell us what the shit is and maybe while we're still your friends,

58:54.880 --> 58:58.000
if we're still your friends, we can help you out of it.

58:58.000 --> 58:58.320
Okay.

58:58.320 --> 59:02.560
So I know the footage got stolen, right?

59:03.440 --> 59:03.760
Yes.

59:04.480 --> 59:07.360
Beck does a kind of embarrassed nod.

59:07.360 --> 59:12.000
And so like I'm getting it back?

59:13.360 --> 59:14.800
To give to us or-

59:15.040 --> 59:20.080
So like maybe not?

59:20.080 --> 59:24.880
Like what, like I had maybe a different plan, but-

59:24.880 --> 59:30.560
Cal looks very, very seriously at them and says, Stevie, this is the news.

59:32.560 --> 59:32.800
Yeah.

59:33.600 --> 59:39.120
It was probably enough to like get my dad to give me whatever I wanted.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.040
So I was just going to like-

59:41.040 --> 59:42.080
Use it as blackmail?

59:42.640 --> 59:43.120
Yeah.

59:45.120 --> 59:45.600
You could have-

59:47.200 --> 59:48.800
I do not condone blackmail.

59:49.360 --> 59:51.360
I thought that you might not.

59:51.360 --> 59:56.160
Beck, maybe if you passed a role, definitely Julius, you could have just gotten a copy.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.440
But a copy is no good if it goes on the news.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.400
If it's already out there, then what's the blackmail good for?

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.040
I mean-

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.480
You were all very, very specifically intent on wanting to get it on the television.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.440
Stevie, is there really something your father could have given you

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.760
that was more valuable than a letter of recommendation from Cal Colorado?

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.120
Yeah.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:19.680
Oh, what?

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.000
Like name a number or like-

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.640
Five.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.280
Yeah.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.080
27.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.560
18.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.080
Negative 90.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:28.800
11.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.280
Okay.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.920
Put a million on the end of any of those except for the negative one,

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.280
because I don't know how that would work out.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.720
And then yeah, that's probably like on the table.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.360
You would owe him then if it was a negative probably.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.840
Oh yeah, so I don't want to do that one.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.340
No.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:51.360
But I thought that it might be enough to where I could actually take over

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.560
and get him to like fuck off, but maybe not.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.040
I don't know.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.520
Stevie, I've got to question your logic there,

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:03.120
that your father would voluntarily give you enough of his fortune for you to take him down with.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:03.360
Yeah.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.800
I think in that case, you would just blackmail him to have the company,

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.920
not for a number that would then be enough to buy it from him.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.600
See, this is why you should watch the news.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.240
So what do you guys think?

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.440
How much should I ask for?

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.880
Cow like sighs deeply.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.080
Well, what is he worth?

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:39.440
I mean, the company I think is 8.3 something, maybe 8.4, somewhere in there.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:40.640
Bill.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.960
Oh, I thought you meant negative million.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.240
No.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.680
Stevie, do you have the tape?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:56.880
What?

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.480
Have you made the pickup yet?

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.120
No.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.320
I want to human that.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.760
Past 20 on 70.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.360
Clearly Stevie was caught completely off guard and it's almost like you

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.040
stripped them down to their veneer by asking the question.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:20.320
And you can just see right through a very simple like, no, that hasn't happened yet.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.840
How did you set up this meeting?

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.680
Like, did you know the cops?

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.680
The cops, by the way, did you know that?

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.440
Well, see, it hasn't even happened yet.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:31.120
So we need to figure out where they are.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.120
Yes, I hold on.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.040
I'd like a sidebar with Beck.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.320
Could you put yourself in your circle or something?

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.640
Just do like a really tiny one in your seat there.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.160
Or just, you know, you could remake the one you made and we'll step out of the car.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:48.480
Okay.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:54.800
So I, because you guys both like passed your power and especially with the crit success,

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.160
like I didn't have you roll grip in the moment and that starting to feel a little bit.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.680
You're right, but I could see this dawning on us how fucked up with that was.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.120
I mean, as you say, as you mentioned that we didn't take a grip test, I'm like,

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.640
oh yes, by the way, Stevie, what the fuck?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:11.940
Yeah.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.800
Can you both roll grip?

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.200
Pass.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.040
10 on a 42.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.280
I pass a 25 on a 49.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.440
You were both whisked away somewhere mentally for a second, but it's not as if they couldn't

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.800
have, you know, maybe projected some sort of image onto your eyeballs or something technologically

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.280
speaking, like something could have happened that made you feel like you were elsewhere.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.360
And I don't know, like we were real tired and just dozed off real quick.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.000
Yeah.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:42.880
Quick nap.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.360
Why not?

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.960
That makes way more sense than mine.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.960
I'm like, it's some wild tech thing that it's hot and new in the city.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.600
Cause you know, the tech in the city is getting out of hand these days.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.400
Not even in the city.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.800
Like it could just be Grover's Gorge tech.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.640
We saw all kinds of amazing things there.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.680
It makes sense that they, oh, you did a little VR.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.640
Like what are those in the fluid?

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.800
Like aggressive attack VR.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:08.880
That's awesome.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.880
Actually, there are nano projectors in the fluid that you encompass.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.600
You know how they film the Mandalorian on that circular green screen?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.000
Right, right.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.480
Yeah.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.040
It's like that, but a portable technology.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.500
Yeah.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.880
That's I don't think that they have that like here, but that sounds like a Grover's Gorge

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.200
kind of thing.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:25.600
Exactly.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.160
It was wild.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:26.960
Remember what they did?

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.640
You know, when you got jackaloped?

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.140
Yeah.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.640
Picture right up.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.280
So of course they could Mandalorian us in my C class.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.400
Deck feels his backside.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.440
Yeah.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.000
I remember.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.520
It feels better than you think as you have the memory of the pain.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.760
And Stevie just kind of like slips out of the Mercedes Cadillac.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.040
And Stevie just kind of slips out of the Cadillac at this point.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.040
What's it for fucking Mercedes?

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.680
Other way around.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.280
And Stevie, why don't you stay right there in the back seat and we'll slip out.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:01.840
Okay.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.560
Gotcha.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.040
Of this.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.160
What kind of car is this?

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.360
It's a Mercedes C class.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:05.860
Cool.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:08.580
Yeah.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.400
Which Luke assured us was nice.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:18.640
Okay.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.440
So we slip out of the car, but back since we lost sight of Stevie.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.080
So easily a few minutes ago is going to like be staring into the back seat as we talk.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:28.320
I think.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:28.820
Yeah.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.440
What you got cow?

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.520
Well, that's the question back.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.880
What do we have here?

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.320
I mean, I've been kind of nervous about once we get to this point in every place we've

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.760
gone so far about like how we physically get it back.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.400
Like they probably got guns, dude.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.840
And they're expecting Stevie.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.920
If we can keep Stevie on our side, I think they're our best bet at getting the footage back.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.760
So we probably need to stay out of sight though for the handoff, right?

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.200
I don't think we can be a part of it.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.360
Cal is thinking very seriously for a minute and he says, I think our best bet at getting

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.600
the footage and showing the public is if for now we let Stevie believe that they can go

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.040
through with the blackmail.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.280
Yeah.

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:17.840
I think at the very least cow vomits on the steering wheel or remember we're out of the

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.080
car.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.880
You're in the car.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.000
God damn it.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.440
You are where we can see you.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.720
It's really smart.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.880
That's what we mean when we say family.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.320
Beck wants to open his door real quick.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.120
Pop his head in.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.280
Stevie, what was the like terms of the deal?

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.120
Were you going to pay them money or how are you going to get the stuff from them?

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.040
Oh, they're like, uh, already on the gato payroll.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.720
So I just acted like they just think you're an agent of.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.280
Exactly.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:45.600
Yeah.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.720
You're like the next higher up that they're passing it on to.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.320
What time are you supposed to meet them, Stevie?

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.600
Uh, well, they're late.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.480
Fuck.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.320
Beck looks around.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.680
Where were you supposed to meet them?

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.720
Like the south gate?

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:57.520
Yeah, the south gate.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.480
Oh, the people's gate.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.840
You know, I used to go there with my father, but we don't have time for that Stevie.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.840
You need to go right away.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.680
We're going to let you carry out your blackmail.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.080
What?

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.640
Really?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.240
We think it's for the good of the people.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.600
Yeah, it is.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.400
And then once you've got yours, we get ours.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:16.960
That's right.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.000
We need a copy though.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.320
Okay.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:18.640
Yeah.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.240
You guys get a exclusive.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.720
Like you're the first people who get it right.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.000
Cal looks hard at Beck.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.400
Yeah.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.880
Beck returns the same kind of face.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.400
So you guys look hard at each other?

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:28.880
Yeah.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.200
Yeah.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:29.760
Real hard.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:30.480
Yeah.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.120
It's hot.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.880
And then, um, don't.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.800
I mean, what do you expect me to fucking do with that?

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:38.720
I said, no, you can just don't.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.320
I like bit down on that laugh earlier and it still came out.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.000
I like really tried to hold it in.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.400
I just specifically leave the part out where I say it's hard.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.920
So the fucking discord doesn't.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:56.240
The spoiler chat just doesn't become the horniest place on earth.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.720
And even though what we're saying is funny right now, please cut it.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.160
Because I'm serious about those discord fucks.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.120
Can't give them an itch.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.680
You're gonna have to say something way worse for it to get cut.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.200
Don't try to bait me.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.320
All right.

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:16.560
Back.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.520
Do you want to try to bait him?

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.040
Cow looks real hard at Beck Beck gets an erection.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.040
That's not appropriate.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.120
That even though you could read into it some other way, what we have here is a father son

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.160
type dynamic.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:48.720
Oh yeah.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.040
No.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.720
So knock it off for sure.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.040
For sure.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:51.520
For sure.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:51.840
For sure.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.800
Which one of you is this step?

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.560
I'm the daddy.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.080
I'm the daddy.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.920
So now it's in your hands, Zach.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.320
What you unleash on the world.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.360
On the edit, baby.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.160
It's on the edit.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.440
We'll see.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.120
Stevie, you got to, you should get going then.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.480
You're going to, you have to meet them.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.600
Well, yeah, I was just popping out because I'm hungry.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.040
Oh, are you meeting them in the subway?

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:29.120
Oh, yeah, they're going to meet me down by the subway.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.560
If you're meeting them in the subway, couldn't you have just gotten a sandwich there?

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.880
Oh my God.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.080
I'm so stupid.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.840
Why did I talk like that?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.080
Stevie, Stevie, you're not stupid.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.360
You're just at the beginning of your life and you've got a lot to learn.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:43.840
Yeah.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.200
But I believe in you, kiddo.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.000
That's awesome.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.000
That's so cool.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.560
Okay, well, do you guys want to like come with me or?

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.760
I don't think they should see us, but if you wanted to, I don't know,

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.760
FaceTime us from your phone pocket or something or from your shirt pocket with your phone in it.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.120
Yeah, I'll put you in my hoodie pocket.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.240
I mean, I've already got your earbuds in all the time.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.440
So like that's, that's kind of my steez, right?

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.360
So like, they're not going to know that.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.560
I thought your name was Stevie.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.440
It's Stevie.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.920
And they're not going to know that I've got one earbud that's talking to you guys.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.360
Beck, I thought their name was Stevie.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:19.860
Yeah.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.880
No, Stevie's like a thing that you say.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.880
They say like kids say it.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.240
Like we say it.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:34.720
Oh, everybody says here in the city in 2022, all the kids are saying Stevie.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.960
And at that moment, you see a familiar car turn the corner

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.360
inside this parking garage and pull up next to you.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.640
How familiar?

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.600
Well, how much do you know about?

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.360
Julia Summers?

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:51.860
No.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.520
The intern, Jeremy and what he drives.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:05.680
Cal, uh, to answer your question, Cal looks over and says, who the fuck is that?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.200
I think if it's, if it's an internet can Beck would know.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.400
Who got you coffee and energy drinks earlier, like yesterday and like for your jobs and stuff.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.200
It was the one that was running alongside our car.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:19.680
Absolutely.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.480
This is Jeremy.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.880
Dude, Cal, it's Jeremy.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:27.440
And sitting shotgun is decide.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.200
Oh no.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.680
I'm just going to wait for Luke to like describe what you guys see as sitting shotgun.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.240
Nice.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:34.560
Hell yeah.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.800
That's also perfectly in time with when I need to pee.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.800
All right, let's get down to the end of the app.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.920
Cal Colorado in the driver's seat of his Mercedes C-class Beck Wilder sitting shotgun.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:59.200
And pulling up is the car of Jeremy, the city action news intern.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.480
He's driving and sitting shotgun.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.320
What do they see?

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:11.360
Julius opens the door, hops out of the passenger's seat, looks at Jeremy.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.140
Thanks.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.480
Slams the door and goes to get in the back seat of Cal's car.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:26.240
Cal presses the lock button and crank, like rolls down the driver's window, just a tad.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.400
Which makes sense because when you look at Julius Summers, you see.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:37.760
He is covered in blood and like bits of brain and flesh.

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.260
What?

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.800
Oh shit.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.360
We're all good.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.120
You got promotions.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.400
I got promotions.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.520
Julius, dude.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.200
Dude, Julius, you're covered.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.520
What's the, yeah, Julius, you are.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.320
Oh, there's a lot of viscera on you.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.760
There was water features and stuff like a fountain.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.120
It got all wet.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.400
Yeah.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:58.900
What?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:00.500
Yeah.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.480
Blood fountain?

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.280
That's blood, dude.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.880
Are you hurt?

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:08.560
Julius looks down at himself and is like, I'm fine.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.440
My face hurts a little bit, but I'm good.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.920
What do we see if we look at his face specifically?

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.420
Blood.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.440
No, but no like specific face trauma.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.120
No wounds or injury.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.560
You can't really, you wouldn't really be able to tell through the blood.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.120
Yeah.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:30.160
And he seems to be, maybe there's like a hole in his shoulder and he's probably like kind

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.720
of holding it just a little bit.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.640
Julius, just so we're clear here, you think you're just a little wet right now?

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.400
Yeah, it'll be fun.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.040
From water?

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.400
From the fountain.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.360
Well, if you were, wouldn't I be terrified because that's my phobia?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:14:01.360
That's a wrap on the episode.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.160
God damn it.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:02.880
Holy shit.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:04.880
Holy shit.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.800
And you said pieces of viscera, like brain?

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:07.860
Yeah.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.420
Wow.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.660
Wow.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.680
What's happening now?

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:15.840
Holy shit.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:26.880
It's all mine for, cause my life is great.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:41.200
And it's all mine, cause my life is great.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:52.160
For if I do, my mom would say.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.200
God damn.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.600
See, old women were terrifying in the nineties.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.640
That aesthetic was not fucking chill.

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.400
That was like an Andrew Dice Clay crowd shot.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.440
Whoa.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.480
He made his mistake.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.600
Relatable moment.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:18.640
Hell yeah.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.360
Raffi even Raffi makes mistakes.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:22.320
Okay.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.600
Can't believe he did it.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:30.400
And we back and we back and we back and we back and we back and we back.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:37.600
Welcome everyone to the 26th episode of season two of pretending to be people.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:41.600
Wow.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.360
I'm curious guys.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.840
We've, we've been through a lot and it's been a while.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.760
And last we left you, we left you on a bit of a cliffhanger, but let's not talk about

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.560
that.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.440
We just did four full episodes as different characters.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.560
I don't know if it's the headphones.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.080
You sound crazy blown out to me.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:02.580
Yeah.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.800
So you might want to check that before we.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:06.880
What the fuck were you talking about?

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.360
I was trying to think of words that rhymed with all your names.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.400
All right, let's run it down.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.200
Joe.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.000
Have you ever seen Joe blowing his load down by the bay?

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.720
That's as far as I got.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.320
Okay, well let's go to Thomas.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.480
That's where I got stuck.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:22.720
Right.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.600
So I guess me next probably would be easier.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:35.040
Have you ever seen Zach attack a rack of snacks down by the shack where he's at down

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.160
by the bay?

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:38.560
Mac.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.840
Have you ever seen Justin busting down by the bay?

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.960
It was like Michael unicycle.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.200
I was taking inspiration from the man himself.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.320
What Michael on a unicycle.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:52.640
Yeah.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.800
He just said, have you ever seen Michael?

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.120
Unicycle.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.360
And then he paused and he said, unicycle down by the bay.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.280
Well, rhymes with Thomas.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:01.780
Promise.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.180
No.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.020
Okay.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.840
Is that the only thing, Thomas?

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.840
Dude, I don't know.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.880
My last name is a lot more.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.600
I mean your whole.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.320
Oh, right.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.240
That would have been the move.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.160
Can't think of anything that rhymes with that either.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:18.660
I saw.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:24.400
I saw Thomas Cox box of Fox eating locks in his socks.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.120
Kicking rocks.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.080
Kicking rocks.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:26.880
Getting off his rocks.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.600
Getting off.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:28.880
Yeah.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.080
You can play around with all that.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:30.320
Yeah.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.360
Down by the bay.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.760
So everyone's jerking off.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:33.920
Yeah.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.800
Except for me.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.000
I'm attacking a rat.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.560
I was watching a box.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.520
Oh, is that code?

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.960
Is that euphemism?

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.680
No, no, no, no.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.360
We were just attacking the rat.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.480
You got to do me now.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.000
I saw Luke eating puke down by the bay.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.080
Have you ever seen Luke eating so much cum that he pukes down by the bay?

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:52.560
Oh no.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.320
Never eat the beach.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.200
Real good energy.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.960
Definitely a good take to stick with.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.680
Down by the bay.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.440
And it's all my fault.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:27.040
In season two, episode 16 of the Pokemon anime, Go West Young Meowth, Meowth reveals that he

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.960
stumbled across a female Meowth when he was young and fell head over heels for her.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.160
She didn't return his affection though because she had a rich trainer and said Meowth and

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:41.440
saw Meowth as a street Meowth who couldn't impress her because he wasn't human.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.080
So Meowth decided to make himself as human as he could.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:48.640
He learned to walk on two legs by watching people practice at a local dance academy,

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:53.760
which also just so happens to offer pronunciation lessons over time.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.520
And with a little help from a picture book, he learned to sound out words.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.000
Unfortunately, that didn't impress the female Meowth who went so far as to call him a freak.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.640
A broken hearted Meowth eventually left to join team Rocket because Rocket

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.440
was the first word he ever understood the meaning of.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.520
According to the logic of this episode then, there isn't anything special about Meowth

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.040
that makes them able to talk to humans.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.200
Theoretically, any Pokemon that is able to speak their own name articulately

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.880
could learn our language.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.800
They just need the proper motivation, a little help, and a lot of determination.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.600
That makes us wonder why more Pokemon haven't bothered to learn our language.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:37.040
It took Pikachu almost 20 years to finally speak in Pokemon I Choose You,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.440
and that might have just been a hallucination.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.560
And he even needed help from Ryan Reynolds and a pretty wild plot twist to speak in

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.560
the Detective Pikachu movie.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.080
Shouldn't Pikachu have been motivated to talk to Ash way before that?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.560
Wait, was Pikachu in love with Ash?

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.680
Because romantic love was the only thing to drive a Pokemon previously to learn English.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.480
I don't think he was.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.080
But then again, having more Pokemon speak like humans would probably run some of the

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.280
magic of the franchise.

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.520
It's part of the series charm that they can only say their names.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.440
It also makes Meowth special.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.120
Of course, maybe Pikachu doesn't care about Ash as much as Team Rocket's Meowth

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.560
cared about the other Meowth.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.080
Oh, so they were on the same page as me?

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.000
Yeah, that was written by Seamus Kelly.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:22.880
Thanks Seamus.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.080
Wow, what a-

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.480
Radio Hedge Fund, nice, says it does also make Team Rocket idiots.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.240
They want to capture a nondescript Pikachu because he is in some way special,

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.080
and yet they have a talking Meowth.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.400
The only one in the world.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.160
This little guy is beyond special, and yet they mistreat him all the time.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.760
Chris says, Slowking also spoke in Pokemon 2000.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.760
Slowking.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.440
Dude, I'm so Slowking stoked for this episode we're about to record.
