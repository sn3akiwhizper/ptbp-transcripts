WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Well, well, well, hello there once again.

00:04.400 --> 00:11.200
Fancy catching you here at this place we call the Radio Waves.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.080
Come on in and have yourself a seat.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.240
Stay a while, listen to me, Wolf the Dog.

00:18.240 --> 00:27.280
Broadcast from 694.2 PTBP, the greatest radio station ever by galactic mile.

00:27.280 --> 00:31.440
That's like a country mile, but for space.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.080
Speaking of great things, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach,

00:36.080 --> 00:42.960
out in Ventura County, California, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.320
Hey, listener, what a fine idea, hmm?

00:46.320 --> 00:51.040
Just a little tweet to tell your friends that you're the kind of freak

00:51.040 --> 00:55.520
that don't shy away from the horrors of at Pretending Pod.

00:55.520 --> 01:01.360
Sounds pretty cool to me, thanks Zach from Ventura County, California.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.640
Zach writes,

01:02.640 --> 01:06.240
Hey Wolf, love you and everyone on the show.

01:06.240 --> 01:11.360
For anyone listening in SoCal looking for their own furry critter companion,

01:11.360 --> 01:14.400
check out the Ventura County Animal Shelter.

01:14.400 --> 01:21.200
They got dogs, cats, rabbits, and all manner of cute cuddly critters looking for homes.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.960
No unnatural horrors, just members of the coalition you haven't met yet.

01:26.960 --> 01:31.120
You never know when you'll need a friend to tell you to hide in the creek.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.040
Thank you for all your hard work.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.760
Can't wait to see what's next in season two.

01:36.720 --> 01:41.360
Well, thanks for writing in, Zach, about these dang good animals.

01:41.360 --> 01:46.560
I share a special bond with all creatures of all dimensions,

01:46.560 --> 01:51.360
and a cool name, Zach, if it's even a real name.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.880
I don't know a single human being named Zach.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.880
Zach is a fake name invented by the Illuminati.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.280
If you know anyone named Zach, report them to the agency.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.000
Do not approach a Zach.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.600
Do not lock eyes with any of them.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.920
They do not exist in this space.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.720
They are from elsewhere that does not exist.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.400
If you want to write up something for your wolf to how,

02:20.400 --> 02:22.880
tag at pretending pod on the internet.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.120
All of our links are in the show notes.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.200
And if you really like this show, like you like like this show,

02:29.200 --> 02:34.400
and you want to show it by showering us with $6 and 66 in coins,

02:34.400 --> 02:37.360
mostly dimes, at least one penny,

02:37.360 --> 02:41.280
you'll be pleased to know that one of those links down there in the show notes

02:41.280 --> 02:46.000
is to our Patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.920
That money buys Papa Wolf the special grease.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.480
This month, you'll get to hear the PTBP boys break down some mistakes

02:54.480 --> 02:58.320
that were edited out of their recent run of control copy.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.840
In a Patreon exclusive bonus episode that Zach,

03:02.480 --> 03:06.560
not a real name, is calling how to be a bad GM.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.400
You won't want to miss this one.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.560
It's over an hour of laughing at that dumb ass Zach's mistakes

03:12.560 --> 03:16.480
while he desperately tries to learn how to do better next time.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.880
But if hyperbolic headlines aren't your thing, don't worry.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.480
It's time for the news.

03:23.040 --> 03:28.240
Last time, Dr. Rusty Hooch, the never missed scientist.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.400
Dr. Olivia Miller, the sad single mom surgeon.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.800
Doreen Maureen, the iPad scrolling Pinterest lady

03:36.800 --> 03:42.400
and the refrigerated pocket having basic training dropout, the Chuckster.

03:42.400 --> 03:48.320
They went to a corrugated metal hunting cabin in the middle of the Arkansas woods,

03:48.320 --> 03:55.200
posing as Dr. Ann Falsom, the Bigfoot scientist and friend to B-U-S-H

03:55.200 --> 04:00.080
in order to retrieve the corpse of an unnatural creature.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.680
However, when Dr. Ann Falsom and her team

04:03.680 --> 04:06.640
entered the headquarters of Bigfoot underground,

04:06.720 --> 04:10.160
search and hunt, the air was sucked out of the room.

04:10.160 --> 04:16.960
Bleeding out on a tarp on a pool table was not the corpse of any sort of Bigfoot,

04:16.960 --> 04:22.800
but rather it was the bruised and bullet-riddled body of a 12-year-old boy.

04:22.800 --> 04:28.480
And as Carl Lambert growled in confusion, it became clear to everyone else

04:28.480 --> 04:33.040
that this dead boy on the table was somehow Michael Lambert,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.400
Carl's brother who weren't missing over 30 years ago.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.080
Something about that math just don't add up.

04:40.080 --> 04:47.120
But that's family for you, always complex, emotional and time-bending.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.680
Here's a brand new track that hits that same familial trinity.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.240
It's Molly Healy with Circles.

05:03.040 --> 05:15.040
Searing star, deafening heat, you don't know why you found it.

05:15.040 --> 05:31.040
In this fate as your widest portion, you'd better learn how to keep it.

05:33.040 --> 05:37.440
I don't know how old you guys are.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.000
You strike me roughly my age, but I don't know.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.120
I don't want to assume.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.000
How old are you guys?

05:42.000 --> 05:42.480
Almost 30.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.360
Sub 30?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.520
Yeah, we're about to turn 30.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.800
And then Allie's 19.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.480
I'm so, I'm 24.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.200
I'm the baby.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.040
Well, I mean, I'm happy then that you, because you recently came out of the closet, right?

05:57.040 --> 06:00.960
So, uh, because I was like, if you're over 30, I'm like, oh man, what a,

06:00.960 --> 06:03.440
so many years you, you lost out on pussy.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.800
How much pussy would you have gotten in homeschool?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.000
Actually a lot.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.800
They're all gay.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.160
Amazing.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.360
I think Allie's pussy game's strong.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.240
It sounded better coming out of her mouth than mine.

06:31.520 --> 06:37.280
Let's talk about your characters and what situation they are currently in.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.920
I think things ended interestingly.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.920
So I'd like to dive into each of your minds for a quick moment.

06:46.800 --> 06:52.480
As you've lost either one sanity for three of you or five sanity for the Chuckster.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.120
Is there anything going on in the Chuckster's mind

06:59.120 --> 07:04.720
other than just cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

07:04.720 --> 07:10.800
As you are looking at this, uh, I assume that the, the flood of chemicals to your brain

07:10.800 --> 07:16.960
that is just shutting you down right now is enough to make it hard to, uh, to assess the

07:16.960 --> 07:17.680
situation.

07:17.680 --> 07:22.160
But I just want to know what's going on in that, in that little fucking pea brain.

07:22.880 --> 07:30.720
I think, uh, the Chuckster has always had the ability to like, I don't know, think everything's

07:30.720 --> 07:31.120
chill.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.400
Everything's fine.

07:32.400 --> 07:37.360
Like even when bad things happen, like getting kicked out of basic training, he's just like,

07:37.360 --> 07:42.480
it's cool, crack a brew and move on with my life and it's all good and everything's happy.

07:42.480 --> 07:47.200
But this is the first time where he's like faced with his own mortality, that something

07:47.200 --> 07:48.960
bad could actually happen to him.

07:48.960 --> 07:53.280
And he does have a very close relationship with his parents, but he has been lying to

07:53.280 --> 07:57.120
them because he wants them to be proud of his accomplishments.

07:57.120 --> 08:04.560
And he's feeling this, I might not measure up and this might be the end and maybe I need

08:04.560 --> 08:06.240
to take things more seriously.

08:06.240 --> 08:06.800
Damn.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.160
That's like really internal.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.880
I was just like, yo, what happened to the Bigfoot?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.640
And you're like, I have to change my life.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.320
I think I'm going to start, uh, doing yoga.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.920
I think that's what he's thinking about.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.280
I got to start, I'm going to start washing my vegetables before I eat them.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.800
Because maybe they have vegetables.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.440
Yeah, that's true.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.920
Maybe I need to figure out what vegetables are.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.160
What's going through Dr. Olivia Miller's mind?

08:36.160 --> 08:42.960
Normally, I think she would, um, be able to separate her professionality with her emotions,

08:42.960 --> 08:46.080
like, because she's seen so many, so many dead bodies in her life.

08:46.080 --> 08:51.280
And also, you know, you know, people coming in from accidents and gnarly shit like that.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.680
Uh, so I think that's why she didn't lose all of her sanity, like Chuck Steere.

08:56.240 --> 09:02.560
Coming from when she had that scene with her daughter, it's always rough to see a child.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.000
It pulls at her heart string a little bit more so.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.160
And also in this way, uh, but also knowing what's going on in the world, having a sense

09:12.160 --> 09:17.440
of the unnatural and the weird occult thinking it's coming for children.

09:17.440 --> 09:23.520
I think she's only been exposed so far to adults having gone through these terrible things.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.440
And so now, uh, faced with a child, it's unsettling to her.

09:27.440 --> 09:33.920
But I think she taps into her professionality immediately and will try to assess the situation.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.720
Notice that Carl is reacting the way he's reacting, so he did not know.

09:39.280 --> 09:45.680
Um, and she will, yeah, she will slowly try to approach the corpse

09:45.680 --> 09:48.240
and make a medical assessment of it.

09:48.240 --> 09:49.120
Yeah, totally.

09:49.120 --> 09:54.560
I think Doreen is kind of in the weird mix of just like going back and forth

09:54.560 --> 09:58.640
between feeling like completely sick because it's a child and she's been

09:58.640 --> 10:01.600
haunted by these little metal melting children.

10:01.680 --> 10:10.080
But at the same time, there's like a weird wrong comfort because she is like an agent

10:10.080 --> 10:18.880
and has dealt with like murder before this almost feels like routine routine to her.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.520
I know.

10:19.520 --> 10:24.240
But I think that's part of the reason why she lost less sanity.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.440
Another day in the office.

10:25.440 --> 10:25.600
Yeah.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.160
She's like good at compartmentalizing.

10:28.160 --> 10:28.560
Yeah.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.440
So does she like spring to action type of person or?

10:31.920 --> 10:35.840
She'd probably be the first one to move forward.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.400
Yeah.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.040
What would even like, what is her move?

10:40.800 --> 10:41.440
Check this out.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.360
I know that you're not an FBI agent.

10:44.400 --> 10:50.160
And I know that we don't always know what the proper like move is.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.840
You know, when you're playing someone who just has a completely different job in life

10:53.840 --> 10:55.200
than we do, it's role playing.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.000
But you know, what would be Doreen's next move?

10:58.000 --> 10:58.800
There's a body.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.880
Nobody touch it.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.640
Trying to find evidence.

11:02.640 --> 11:08.160
Rusty over here should take this moment to like analyze the body.

11:08.160 --> 11:08.960
Maybe me too.

11:08.960 --> 11:09.520
Sure.

11:09.520 --> 11:16.000
And, and Dr. Miller, of course, surgeon, you guys have like a good team for, for analyzing

11:16.000 --> 11:17.600
the situation for sure.

11:17.600 --> 11:21.040
I think it's interesting because Doreen, I would imagine is normally trying to figure

11:21.040 --> 11:22.160
out who killed the body.

11:22.160 --> 11:22.640
Right.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.720
But in this case, you know, you know, it's pretty obvious, you know.

11:26.720 --> 11:33.120
But I think the question right now is how did this body get here when did it, is this

11:33.120 --> 11:36.720
morphed from something else or like, did something put this here?

11:36.720 --> 11:37.520
Totally.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.240
Yeah.

11:38.240 --> 11:44.240
Rusty, I think she's pretty almost in a twisted way, like finally paying attention.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.760
Like she's interested now.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.400
Like she's been a little preoccupied with her personal life.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.200
She's pretty selfish and private and she's been pretty like annoyed by her fellow agent.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.720
So she hasn't really been giving a shit.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.240
And it's very one-to-one with Ali's experience so far in the game.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.240
I was very annoyed by my fellow agents.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.280
Didn't really give a shit.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.760
But now that there's a dead body, I'm pretty stoked.

12:07.760 --> 12:13.280
Well, and like, cause her experiences with the unnatural occurrences were like very impersonal

12:13.280 --> 12:16.080
because she was so far removed from everything else.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.520
So everyone else had a more like personal hands-on experience.

12:19.520 --> 12:24.640
So now that she's seeing this body, she's like kind of finally like taking it seriously

12:24.640 --> 12:29.840
and is actually like interested and she needs to be interested in something to do her job well.

12:31.280 --> 12:35.360
Is she thinking like, I see my next Nobel prize.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.440
Exactly.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.440
I think like probably for everyone, the Delta green part of your brain

12:41.440 --> 12:44.960
in the back of your brain is saying, where's the evidence?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.160
How do we destroy it and make sure this doesn't get out?

12:48.880 --> 12:52.400
And finally, there is a certain amount of evidence

12:52.400 --> 12:57.840
that lives inside the brains of witnesses, right?

12:57.840 --> 13:00.960
So you do know that Jerome Dyer is another Delta green agent.

13:00.960 --> 13:07.280
It's fine if he knows, but there are two civilians in this room right now, Carl Lambert,

13:07.280 --> 13:14.480
crying for Michael, who you remember to be the name of his younger brother who went missing

13:14.480 --> 13:19.760
almost 30 years ago, but who is still a 12 year old corpse on this table right now.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.080
And then you have Janice Ruth, who is also in this room.

13:24.080 --> 13:31.600
So I'm going to cut to her real quick as she is going to make a beeline for the front door.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.200
Hell no.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.840
Am I real quick?

13:37.840 --> 13:39.680
Am I pretty incapacitated?

13:39.680 --> 13:40.320
Oh yeah.

13:40.320 --> 13:40.720
Okay.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.040
Yeah.

13:41.040 --> 13:41.520
Sorry.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.640
Ellie, you said Dr. Miller was going to be really interested in going up to the body,

13:44.640 --> 13:49.600
but as soon as Janice Ruth starts making a move, you reacted immediately.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.360
So let's go to you.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.280
Do you step into her way or?

13:54.000 --> 13:59.040
The thing is I want to, Ellie, but I don't know if my character would be,

13:59.040 --> 14:04.960
have that sort of role in her behavior because she's unbelievably clumsy and

14:06.080 --> 14:07.360
like my dex is not great.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.360
So I feel like it would be one of those like situations where I'm like somebody stop her,

14:15.360 --> 14:19.680
but I would try to motion for her if I can, like I can roll for it.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.560
I mean, who knows?

14:20.560 --> 14:20.960
I don't know.

14:20.960 --> 14:21.760
Alertness.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.040
Would that be a thing or?

14:23.040 --> 14:23.280
Yeah.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.840
Let's actually just have all three of you who've succeeded on your sanity checks.

14:27.840 --> 14:34.960
If you could all roll alertness and actually Lindsey is Doreen's alertness or search higher.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.840
I succeed.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.480
Okay, great.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.680
I got a little roll.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.480
I got a 12.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.360
Oh, nice.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.560
I got a 97 on a 20.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.800
My alertness is higher than my search.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.760
And what did you roll?

14:46.320 --> 14:46.960
Oh, I sorry.

14:46.960 --> 14:47.680
I haven't rolled yet.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.480
74 on a 70.

14:56.560 --> 14:56.880
Okay.

14:56.880 --> 15:02.480
So Ellie, I'm going to give you the option since you're the only one who succeeded.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.920
Are you, uh, are you going to make a move toward the door to stop Janice Ruth before

15:05.920 --> 15:09.040
she goes out or are you going to immediately check out the body?

15:09.040 --> 15:14.080
Miller wants to check out the body, but she is the body, but she is a super, super, she's

15:14.080 --> 15:14.800
cool right now.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.080
She's cool headed, level headed.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.680
So she knows exactly what's going on.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.680
Her perception is on point.

15:19.680 --> 15:24.560
So she just straight up goes to, uh, she catches Ruth by the arm.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.520
Oh, there's no need.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.120
There's no need to panic.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.200
No, are you kidding me?

15:31.200 --> 15:31.700
Panic?

15:33.360 --> 15:33.860
Panicking.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.960
You seem to have been through a lot.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.920
This happens a lot.

15:39.920 --> 15:47.280
And she is going to lie and she's going to try to convince Ruth that she is hallucinating.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.320
She's been hallucinating, uh, had some sort of head trauma.

15:50.320 --> 15:54.880
She's going to try to do like a medical, do the power of suggestion of like, how have

15:54.880 --> 15:55.920
you been sleeping lately?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.160
Have you had any head trauma?

15:58.160 --> 15:58.720
All right.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.840
Uh, do you have psychotherapy?

15:59.840 --> 16:00.240
Yes.

16:00.240 --> 16:00.800
Oh, awesome.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.400
Go ahead and roll psychotherapy.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.800
Uh, not super high.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.240
41 for psychotherapy.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.600
Where's my psychotherapy?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.680
Where the fuck is my fucking psychotherapy?

16:13.680 --> 16:16.720
Uh, no, um, I have nevermind.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.840
Uh, no, I failed.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.240
I know what it was.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.120
I know what it was.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.080
I know what it is.

16:24.080 --> 16:24.580
No.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.000
Calm down.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.640
Calm down.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.760
I just, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.320
Um, I'm going to, yeah.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.720
She's going to need to be restrained.

16:36.720 --> 16:36.960
Yeah.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.360
All right.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.160
So, uh, can I punch her in the face?

16:40.160 --> 16:40.640
Jesus.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.080
Can I just, can I try and restart?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.280
I probably have.

16:45.280 --> 16:45.520
Yeah.

16:45.520 --> 16:50.400
I think at this point, if, uh, the other two who have succeeded on their sanity checks

16:50.400 --> 16:52.160
want to, want to move in to help.

16:52.160 --> 16:52.480
Yeah.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.520
I think I probably have things to help restrain.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.480
Medical doctor, do you have an inhaler in your bag?

16:59.120 --> 17:06.320
I didn't take one out last week, but, uh, do I, Zach, please?

17:06.320 --> 17:06.800
Always.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.960
I, I like to think that everyone has everything.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.480
Everyone's very well prepared.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.000
You wouldn't be in Delta Green if you weren't.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.400
Oh, what's this?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.160
A million dollars in my pocket.

17:19.200 --> 17:19.680
Okay.

17:19.680 --> 17:25.280
I'm gonna shove the inhaler in her and try to shove a inhaler in her mouth.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.680
So as Dr. Hooch and Doreen Marine kind of grab either side of this woman and set her

17:31.680 --> 17:36.720
down onto the ground, still with the echo of cool, cool, cool, cool.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.160
She's in the background.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.160
Uh, Dr. Miller pulls out an inhaler, helps Janice Ruth with.

17:42.160 --> 17:51.840
Uh, you look over and you see Jerome Dyer.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.320
Agent Dyer is, uh, is comforting.

17:55.040 --> 18:00.400
Carl Lambert, who is now on his knees, kind of crawled up toward the pool table.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.920
He's got his elbows on the pool table and his hands flat.

18:03.920 --> 18:09.200
Chin is on his hands and he's just crying and staring at the face.

18:09.520 --> 18:15.680
You know, kind of from the side, uh, on this corpse of this, again, just completely bruised

18:15.680 --> 18:21.600
every single part of the skin all the way down is blue and black and purple with bruising.

18:21.600 --> 18:27.520
And there's just slug hole after slug hole with blood just pouring out and pooling on

18:27.520 --> 18:28.400
this tarp below.

18:28.960 --> 18:36.560
And Jerome Dyer is just comforting Carl as best he can as Carl is just weeping and moaning.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.840
This was a separate room, right?

18:38.400 --> 18:43.360
Basically the setup of this room is you walk in the front door on your right, there's a

18:43.360 --> 18:44.160
bathroom.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.480
There's not like a door to the bathroom.

18:46.480 --> 18:51.200
There's just a stall door with a toilet in the stall with a sink next to it.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.600
That's all still open in this room.

18:54.160 --> 19:01.120
There's a skee-ball table right next to our skee-ball, you know, uh, not table machine,

19:01.120 --> 19:04.160
machine, skee-ball machine right next to the toilet.

19:04.800 --> 19:10.480
And, um, uh, and then, you know, uh, in the middle of the room is this pool table with

19:10.480 --> 19:15.360
the tarp on it where this boy's body is laying lifeless in the corner of the room.

19:15.360 --> 19:23.280
There's some couches and a TV, and then all hanging on the walls is equipment for both

19:23.280 --> 19:28.080
Bigfoot hunting and for YouTube video making the two most important things in life.

19:28.720 --> 19:32.960
And you also would notice that, uh, there's some like work desks and stuff where they've

19:32.960 --> 19:35.280
got their, uh, computer set up.

19:35.280 --> 19:40.720
Jerome Dyer's looking back at one of the computers and he pulls out his phone and looks at the

19:40.720 --> 19:43.360
time and, and then, and that doesn't matter.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.320
I was just, I just kept talking for some reason.

19:46.320 --> 19:51.600
Okay, so, uh, just like, and then this happens, and then this happens.

19:53.200 --> 20:00.720
Dr. Millie would, uh, tries to get the attention of, uh, Dr. Rusty Hooch or Dr. Falsom.

20:01.120 --> 20:06.400
Pretend name is right now and be like, we should try to look at the body, but we need

20:06.400 --> 20:08.960
to calm these two assholes down first.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.200
Um, but she doesn't say that she tries to do it with her eyebrows.

20:13.200 --> 20:13.700
Exactly.

20:14.400 --> 20:19.440
Can I go out to the lab and cook something up to knock them out?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.600
Oh yeah, absolutely.

20:21.600 --> 20:21.920
Okay.

20:21.920 --> 20:28.640
So I see Dr. Miller looking at me and I just kind of sneak out the back while you two are

20:28.640 --> 20:29.840
holding her down.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.880
As Dr. Miller can kind of go look at the body, Doreen is still with Janice Ruth and

20:34.880 --> 20:38.560
Janice looks up at you and she's like, are you going to help?

20:39.440 --> 20:40.240
What's happening?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.400
Honey, I got my iPad out in the car.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.360
Let me just go get it.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.640
It'll calm you down.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.240
It calms me down every night.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.440
Oh no, no, I need you.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.880
I need you right here.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.440
All right.

20:49.440 --> 20:49.940
Okay.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.600
What do we do?

20:51.600 --> 20:54.560
I pull out my personal cell phone and I pull up Pinterest.

20:54.560 --> 20:55.060
Okay.

20:55.060 --> 20:59.060
What do we do?

20:59.060 --> 21:00.580
Just look at the pretty pictures, honey.

21:00.580 --> 21:01.780
Just look at the pretty pictures.

21:01.780 --> 21:06.980
This is literally like you're at the zoo, like on one side of the glass, like showing

21:06.980 --> 21:10.180
the chimpanzee, like pictures of other chimpanzees.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.100
And they're like telling you like, oh, nice.

21:12.100 --> 21:12.340
Okay.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.540
You can swipe to the next one.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.820
I love that video, but this is Janice Ruth's version.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.500
She's like, that's nice.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.540
Let's go to the next one.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.140
Oh, thank you.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.020
That's a nice couch.

21:22.980 --> 21:23.480
Oh God.

21:24.340 --> 21:26.820
What is, is it like interior design porn?

21:26.820 --> 21:28.980
I'm showing her videos of cooking.

21:30.020 --> 21:35.220
I'm showing her like TikTok cooking videos and then like, and then interior design.

21:35.220 --> 21:39.460
Those like tiny cooking videos where everything's super small and she's like,

21:39.460 --> 21:40.500
everything's made of felt.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.620
She's like, how did they make a spatula so small?

21:45.620 --> 21:48.020
She like actually gets upset again because she doesn't understand.

21:48.660 --> 21:52.180
While she's, while, uh, Janice Ruth is distracted.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.620
Can I come back in with the shit?

21:53.620 --> 21:55.220
But I need to approach Dr.

21:55.220 --> 21:56.260
Miller first.

21:56.260 --> 22:02.580
Rural pharmacy for what got, what got up, what you made for what happened in the lab.

22:02.580 --> 22:03.940
55 on an 80.

22:03.940 --> 22:05.460
That is a critical success.

22:07.300 --> 22:07.700
Oh my gosh.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.220
You're going to knock her out forever.

22:14.020 --> 22:14.660
Oh my gosh.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.620
You can fucking kill her.

22:15.620 --> 22:20.500
Perfect because it's a critical success.

22:20.500 --> 22:24.660
You can, uh, and because we made so many jokes about potions,

22:24.660 --> 22:28.180
uh, you can give this if, I mean, if they'll take it right.

22:28.180 --> 22:32.820
You have a liquid that is going to be clear.

22:33.380 --> 22:35.780
It is going to be unscented.

22:35.780 --> 22:42.580
It will have no taste and you cannot see it and they will only wake up when you, um,

22:42.660 --> 22:45.780
is it the yin yang twins who said, snap your fingers?

22:45.780 --> 22:46.280
Yeah.

22:48.340 --> 22:55.140
Wait, can it be in a tiny, tiny cauldron and then maybe have some like smoke coming out of it?

22:56.820 --> 23:05.940
Sometimes when you interject, it's useful all the time.

23:05.940 --> 23:11.300
No, but it's as tiny as the tiny cooking videos, so she's intrigued.

23:11.380 --> 23:11.540
Yeah.

23:11.540 --> 23:12.980
She actually really likes it.

23:12.980 --> 23:14.020
My God.

23:15.220 --> 23:15.620
All right.

23:15.620 --> 23:22.980
So I, um, I have this tiny, tiny culture in my hand, but I, I approached Dr.

23:22.980 --> 23:26.500
Miller while Janice Ruth is being distracted with tiny cooking videos.

23:28.180 --> 23:32.660
All right, listen, I've got something and I'm talking low so I can use my, my normal voice.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.940
I'm not in character right now.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.900
I've got something that'll knock these fuckers out, but as soon as I give it to him,

23:38.900 --> 23:40.660
we're not going to be able to ask him a damn thing.

23:40.660 --> 23:41.940
So do I need to wait a second?

23:41.940 --> 23:42.740
What do I do?

23:42.740 --> 23:43.460
That's a good point.

23:44.020 --> 23:48.580
Like it, it seems like, um, our friend here has been able to calm her down somewhat.

23:48.580 --> 23:50.180
Let's try to talk to them before.

23:50.180 --> 23:55.140
And if they become aggravated again, let's use your little cauldron.

23:55.140 --> 23:56.340
All right, we're going to need a word.

23:57.140 --> 23:57.700
Banana.

23:58.340 --> 23:59.700
But banana, got it.

24:00.260 --> 24:01.540
That's my safety word.

24:03.060 --> 24:05.940
You say banana, those fuckers knocked out immediately.

24:06.660 --> 24:07.300
Exactly.

24:07.300 --> 24:07.700
Perfect.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.260
Thank you.

24:08.260 --> 24:08.900
Thank you.

24:08.900 --> 24:09.540
Good job.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.500
Good thinking there.

24:10.500 --> 24:14.580
She gives like a nod of approval to, uh, to Rusty.

24:14.580 --> 24:21.300
And then I go and I hide my, I hide my, Rusty comes immediately.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.340
Then I hide my tiny cauldrons.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.380
Where do you hide it?

24:31.380 --> 24:32.660
I put it in the corner.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.980
Labeled tiny cauldron.

24:37.060 --> 24:42.740
The Chuckster is coming out of his, uh, of his temp insane temp insane.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.580
So it started out like really high.

24:44.580 --> 24:45.620
Cool, cool, cool.

24:45.620 --> 24:51.780
And as he comes back, it's like, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,

24:51.780 --> 24:53.300
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

24:54.500 --> 24:55.860
And then that's him just being normal.

24:58.740 --> 24:59.060
Okay.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.420
You're looking at this situation.

25:00.420 --> 25:06.500
Currently we have Doreen Marine is showing Pinterest videos to Janice Ruth

25:06.500 --> 25:08.340
and keeping her calm in the corner.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.340
I'm picturing her in the corner, like up against the bathroom stall door.

25:12.340 --> 25:19.380
It's literally the exact same shot of Doreen, like over someone and like a bathroom stall.

25:19.380 --> 25:23.460
But this time she's helping as opposed to slamming a teenager into the toilet.

25:24.420 --> 25:31.140
Dr. Rusty Hooch is carefully placing a tiny cauldron into the corner for safekeeping.

25:31.220 --> 25:37.700
And, um, Dr. Olivia Miller is heading straight to the body to give it a thorough look over

25:37.700 --> 25:41.380
as the Chuckster comes out of the situation and also sees

25:41.380 --> 25:49.860
Carl Lambert staring at the body with agent Jerome Dyer kind of stroking his, um, lack of hair.

25:49.860 --> 25:53.220
Can I roll a medicine to see, uh, what I see?

25:53.860 --> 25:55.300
Yes, please roll.

25:56.260 --> 26:00.900
Oh, well, 55 on a 60 actually.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.380
Holy fucking shit, Ellie.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.220
55.

26:10.500 --> 26:19.300
So, um, because you critically succeeded mathematically, it just fucking happens all

26:19.300 --> 26:19.780
the time.

26:20.740 --> 26:21.220
Wait, it is.

26:21.700 --> 26:21.940
Okay.

26:21.940 --> 26:24.180
So it's, uh, one is a create zero.

26:24.180 --> 26:25.860
One is the critical success.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.540
Um, and then 100 is a critical fail.

26:29.540 --> 26:33.780
So if you've got, that's 11 chances to critical out of a hundred.

26:33.780 --> 26:38.020
So there's an 11% chance, but I feel like it's happening more than 11% of the time.

26:39.460 --> 26:40.420
God is in this house.

26:40.420 --> 26:42.500
No, it's still happening to me, but it's a crit fail.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.020
Okay.

26:46.020 --> 26:53.460
So with that being said, I am going to have Lindsay, Allie, Taylor, go ahead and take

26:53.460 --> 26:56.420
off your headphones and get the fuck out of the living room.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.500
So you can't hear me talk to Ellie right now.

26:59.940 --> 27:00.440
What?

27:01.220 --> 27:03.140
This is a game mechanic in the game.

27:03.140 --> 27:04.020
That's so funny.

27:04.020 --> 27:07.380
So Ellie, I like to run closed games.

27:07.380 --> 27:12.980
So, uh, you know, obviously with all the introduction stuff, I think it's fun to let

27:12.980 --> 27:17.780
everyone in on like the character full, like character idea of each person, even

27:17.780 --> 27:21.300
though you meet as strangers and you wouldn't know all that information beforehand.

27:21.300 --> 27:26.660
But once we get into the shit and someone learns a piece of valuable information that

27:26.660 --> 27:31.140
the others wouldn't know, I think it's fun to just give that piece of information to

27:31.140 --> 27:33.140
the person playing the character who knows it.

27:33.700 --> 27:34.260
Okay.

27:34.260 --> 27:34.900
Interesting.

27:34.900 --> 27:35.220
All right.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.740
So I can make a decision later whether I share it or not.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.420
Yeah.

27:40.420 --> 27:45.060
And this is kind of a pretty, uh, pivotal moment in the story.

27:45.060 --> 27:49.060
So as Dr.

27:49.060 --> 27:55.700
Olivia Miller checks out this body underneath all this bruising, all this black and blue

27:55.700 --> 28:06.420
and purple bruising up near the chest of this boy, there seems to be a rash and it's in

28:06.420 --> 28:08.100
the form of a circle.

28:08.660 --> 28:14.740
You see the biggest circle first, and it probably goes over the shoulder, under the arm a little

28:14.740 --> 28:21.540
bit around the pectoral muscle, over the clavicle, and then back around forming an enormous circle

28:21.540 --> 28:26.900
over the, over the chest, kind of exactly where you would put your hand over your heart

28:26.900 --> 28:29.460
to, uh, you know, swear an oath.

28:30.180 --> 28:33.460
And then you notice a smaller circle just inside that bigger one.

28:34.420 --> 28:41.380
And these are just these red rashes and they're thick lines as they get closer to the center.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.620
And you see, it's like a bullseye.

28:43.620 --> 28:44.660
It's like a target.

28:45.300 --> 28:49.460
And in the very middle, you begin to look really closely.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.540
You've got your gloves on, you're all suited up.

28:51.540 --> 28:59.540
So you're able to kind of move the skin around and the skin is so wrinkly, like it's been

28:59.540 --> 29:04.580
stretched out and now it's kind of sunken back in.

29:04.580 --> 29:07.860
Like, oh, my doorbell rang.

29:07.860 --> 29:08.500
That's odd.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.220
Oh, perfect.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.940
And, uh, I'm sorry.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.300
I'm going to get that real quick.

29:13.300 --> 29:15.060
This is the worst time to do this.

29:19.620 --> 29:20.660
Sorry about that.

29:20.660 --> 29:25.220
It's my good friend Joe's birthday, uh, in three days.

29:25.220 --> 29:26.900
And that was his birthday present in the mail.

29:27.300 --> 29:27.800
Yay.

29:29.300 --> 29:29.800
Okay.

29:30.340 --> 29:32.260
Back into the most intense thing we've done.

29:32.980 --> 29:33.480
Yeah.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.220
I'm like, I'm like, okay, so it's stretched out.

29:37.220 --> 29:37.780
He's big.

29:37.780 --> 29:38.180
Okay.

29:38.180 --> 29:46.100
You notice as you kind of pinch at the center of this bullseye, there's a divot dug out

29:46.100 --> 29:54.500
in the skin as if there was something, like if a golf ball were to land on the green,

29:54.980 --> 30:01.540
uh, from a high place, then it would make a round spot in the grass.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.820
Like a crater.

30:02.820 --> 30:03.380
Yes.

30:03.380 --> 30:10.500
Like a very, very small crater, just a, um, concave skin spot.

30:11.380 --> 30:16.100
But because it's so wrinkly, it's almost like, um, it's almost like if you had an

30:16.100 --> 30:21.140
uninflated balloon that you've taken scissors to just like an edge part of.

30:21.140 --> 30:26.980
So there's just a little hole, like a little circle hole there in the skin.

30:28.020 --> 30:34.820
And because you critically succeeded out of the corner of your eye, as you're pinching

30:34.820 --> 30:50.340
the skin and noticing this little hole, you see something tiny black with countless legs.

30:51.700 --> 31:01.860
Crawling on the ground of the dirty tile floor and this weird impromptu cabin barn thing.

31:03.860 --> 31:07.460
And it looks to your eyes like a tick.

31:08.180 --> 31:09.940
You've never seen a tick like this.

31:09.940 --> 31:16.180
It has so many legs all around to where as it's moving, it just kind of looks like it's

31:16.180 --> 31:18.020
floating right above the ground.

31:18.580 --> 31:19.080
Ugh.

31:19.620 --> 31:20.980
Go ahead and roll sanity.

31:23.140 --> 31:25.700
31 on to my current 55.

31:26.260 --> 31:26.740
Okay.

31:26.740 --> 31:29.060
You're not going to lose any sanity.

31:29.060 --> 31:36.020
You know, from your medical training and experience that a bull's eye rash is actually

31:36.020 --> 31:38.740
a common occurrence in tick bites.

31:38.740 --> 31:39.780
Tick bites.

31:39.780 --> 31:40.740
Tick bites.

31:40.740 --> 31:41.060
Yeah.

31:41.060 --> 31:43.060
I've actually had a fair amount of ticks.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.740
They're common in Sweden.

31:44.740 --> 31:45.060
Yeah.

31:45.060 --> 31:49.380
So, you know, it's always a bad sign when you get like, because you can get that several

31:49.380 --> 31:53.060
weeks after they've stung you and then you have to.

31:53.060 --> 31:53.540
Yeah.

31:53.540 --> 31:54.100
All right.

31:54.100 --> 32:00.580
Well, my theory, if we're now doing it secretly, and I had this theory last time when you

32:00.580 --> 32:07.780
reveal the body and everyone's reaction is that it's somehow this boy is Bigfoot, right?

32:07.780 --> 32:11.060
But he's morphing back like a werewolf or something.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.020
That's my thing.

32:12.020 --> 32:12.420
Right.

32:12.420 --> 32:12.920
Yeah.

32:13.320 --> 32:19.240
But, you know, much more awful way, but I didn't account for the tick.

32:19.240 --> 32:23.320
So now I'm a little, I'm a little interested and curious, but I don't know.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.240
So do I have to tell them or is it up to me?

32:25.240 --> 32:26.360
You don't have to tell them.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.400
You can just describe your actions however you would like, but I'm going to have basically

32:31.400 --> 32:36.440
this will be your moment is your moment of knowledge is going to be your turn here.

32:36.440 --> 32:42.680
And then as we, as we bring everyone back in, I'm actually going to move into combat

32:42.680 --> 32:46.360
order and we're going to like, we're in combat rounds.

32:47.160 --> 32:47.660
Okay.

32:49.720 --> 32:55.720
Hello, please come back and record the rest of the day.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.080
Zach, this is such a good, like, you're such a good GM.

33:01.080 --> 33:01.400
Thank you.

33:02.280 --> 33:02.760
Thank you.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.480
Great.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.120
So much fun.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.320
What'd y'all talk about?

33:05.320 --> 33:05.960
Welcome back.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.800
We're moving into combat order.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.960
I would like to know what your dexterity are because we're going to move from whoever

33:11.960 --> 33:16.280
has the highest dexterity down to whoever has the lowest dexterity.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.920
So do you want the score or the times five score?

33:18.920 --> 33:19.560
Either one.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.480
Cause I'll know the difference.

33:21.480 --> 33:22.120
12.

33:22.120 --> 33:22.600
Okay.

33:23.160 --> 33:23.720
12.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.760
Oh shit.

33:24.760 --> 33:25.560
10.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.440
Fine.

33:26.440 --> 33:26.940
10.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.120
Damn.

33:28.120 --> 33:28.680
Okay.

33:28.680 --> 33:31.720
So yeah, rock, scissors, paper.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.160
This will be hilarious because Lindsay and Ellie have the delay.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.080
So let's start with Ali and Taylor.

33:37.960 --> 33:38.360
Okay.

33:38.360 --> 33:39.320
Do you do shoot?

33:39.320 --> 33:40.600
Shoot is for losers.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.480
Rock, paper, shoot.

33:41.960 --> 33:42.920
Rock, paper, shoot.

33:44.600 --> 33:44.840
All right.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.800
Ali goes first.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.360
Uh, rock, paper, shoot.

33:50.040 --> 33:51.320
This is going to be hilarious.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.440
I'm just going to close my eyes and do it.

33:55.240 --> 33:55.640
All right.

33:55.640 --> 33:56.680
Rock, paper, scissors.

33:57.560 --> 33:58.120
Open your eyes.

33:59.160 --> 33:59.640
Oh, fuck.

34:02.920 --> 34:03.480
All right.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.640
So it is going to go Dr.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.480
Rusty Hooch, then Chuck the Chuckster, then.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.560
Actually, after that experience that I had, uh, where I lost my sanity,

34:13.560 --> 34:15.640
I'm, I'm trying to be more serious.

34:15.640 --> 34:18.040
So I'm like, call me, call me Charles.

34:18.040 --> 34:18.280
Now

34:22.520 --> 34:29.880
he says to God inside his own head, he's like, I really say that to yourself.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.400
You're like, you get this together.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.200
Chuckster.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.360
No, get this together.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.080
Charles.

34:38.040 --> 34:38.600
Amazing.

34:40.360 --> 34:40.360


34:41.160 --> 34:45.080
Charles, the serious, very serious boy.

34:47.720 --> 34:49.000
We're going to start with Jerome.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.560
Then we're going to do Dr.

34:51.560 --> 34:57.160
Rusty Hooch, Charles, Charles, Charles.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.440
You can call me Charles T's.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.360
I'll call you just Charles.

35:00.360 --> 35:04.200
Then, uh, then it will be Carl.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.440
And then we'll have Doreen and Miller.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.880
And then I don't know.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.000
I'm just saying this out loud.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.040
I'm going to cut it from the show.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.720
Oh, so we can say weird stuff.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.520
And I like poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.880
And now it's all staying in.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.640
Janice Ruth is going to be last.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.520
So, uh, okay.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.800
So as far as you guys know, everything is the exact same.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.600
When you look over, you can notice that Dr.

35:28.600 --> 35:33.240
Miller is, uh, is pinching at the skin on the chest of this corpse.

35:33.240 --> 35:37.800
She is wearing like a full hazmat suit and gloves at this point, as are

35:38.520 --> 35:39.320
all four of you.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.560
If you forgot about that and your mental image of the scene, throw it back in there.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.760
And so we're going to have Dr.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.680
Hooch kick this thing off.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.280
As you also would see, Dr.

35:50.280 --> 35:57.800
Miller is now releasing the skin and begins looking for, uh, something in her

35:57.800 --> 36:01.080
pockets or bag that she has with her.

36:01.080 --> 36:01.800
And it's Dr.

36:01.800 --> 36:02.360
Hooch's turn.

36:02.360 --> 36:02.680
Dr.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.040
Hooch, what do you do?

36:04.040 --> 36:04.280
Okay.

36:04.280 --> 36:07.800
So I run over there because I'm supposed to be the doctor.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.200
Aren't you a scientist?

36:10.200 --> 36:12.200
Yeah, but, uh, and Folsom.

36:12.200 --> 36:13.640
Oh, that's right.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.920
We're still keeping up appearances at this point.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.560
I forgot.

36:17.560 --> 36:21.320
So I put my cauldron down and I quickly remember that I'm supposed to be the

36:21.320 --> 36:22.520
doctor in the situation.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.960
So I run over to Dr.

36:23.960 --> 36:30.760
Miller, put my British accent back on and I loudly say, I loudly say this.

36:34.680 --> 36:35.880
Right.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.320
Let me take a look at the body.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.360
Don't no one touch.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.560
Move aside, move aside.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.040
Which is perfect because she's already moving aside.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.320
It is now Charles's turn.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.920
I don't understand.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.880
Is everything as I saw it last?

36:49.880 --> 36:50.380
Yep.

36:51.000 --> 36:51.400
Okay.

36:51.400 --> 36:55.080
That's kind of the uncomfortable thing about moving into dexterity order in

36:55.080 --> 36:58.200
Delta Green is sometimes you don't know why or why.

36:58.200 --> 37:02.280
Cause a lot of times we'd be in moving in dexterity order when you're in combat

37:02.280 --> 37:04.360
and then like a gunfight or a chase.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.400
So this could be either one of those, but it also could just be me being like,

37:09.400 --> 37:13.560
and now we're moving in dexterity order to make it seem like the tight

37:13.560 --> 37:14.920
intention of the situation.

37:14.920 --> 37:15.160
Okay.

37:15.160 --> 37:20.440
I think that I'm going to use my two months of basic training knowledge.

37:20.440 --> 37:25.640
I'm going to, I'm going to barrel roll over to the door and secure it.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.800
I'm going to secure the place so that no one can escape.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.720
Ocular pat down of the entire place.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.760
You are at the only doors, the entrance and the exit.

37:32.760 --> 37:33.560
Excellent move.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.400
Jerome Dyer is still very much calming down Carl.

37:38.200 --> 37:42.440
As Carl begins, let's see, actually, I'm going to go ahead and roll for Carl's

37:42.440 --> 37:43.320
sanity here.

37:45.320 --> 37:50.680
Carl's eyes begin to turn to anger.

37:51.320 --> 37:56.920
And if anyone were to notice you, you, you're hearing Carl's sobs become more

37:57.000 --> 37:59.720
just like, what the fuck?

38:05.960 --> 38:08.520
Which I'm realizing now would be hard not to notice.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.040
And Janice Ruth is, I'm just okay.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.320
I'm just going to be okay.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.600
I'm just going to be okay.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.400
And I keep rolling really high sanity checks.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.480
And so I'm going to lose my mind again a little bit.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.560
And she looks up at Doreen.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.680
She says, I'm fine now.

38:23.240 --> 38:27.640
And she's going to try to stand up and, uh, and move toward the door that both.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.760
Now Doreen is kind of in the way of, as well as Charles.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.360
Is it my turn?

38:32.360 --> 38:32.680
Yeah.

38:32.680 --> 38:37.880
I think for Doreen specifically, she's just really ready to help with the body,

38:37.880 --> 38:44.120
but I guess if she's fucking relegated, taking care of old lady on the ground.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.240
She sure did.

38:45.800 --> 38:51.960
I guess for this turn, I'm going to try and convince Janice to not leave the premises.

38:51.960 --> 38:52.840
Yeah, great.

38:52.840 --> 38:57.560
If you want to roll persuade or psychotherapy, which everyone's higher.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.480
I rolled an 86 on a 50.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.160
Damn, not lucky with the rolls.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.840
At least it's not a crit fail.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.040
At least it's not a crit fail.

39:12.600 --> 39:19.160
Janice Ruth stands up and is going to move past you.

39:19.240 --> 39:23.560
Now only has Charles between herself and the door.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.400
Dr. Miller, it is your turn.

39:25.400 --> 39:32.040
Dr. Miller sees that Janice is on her way to the door and she says with, uh, I'm going

39:32.040 --> 39:36.680
to roll a persuade for this and she's going to say, if you leave, I have reasons to believe

39:36.680 --> 39:37.880
that we're all going to die.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.960
That is a strong persuade.

39:39.960 --> 39:46.680
Uh, it's also weird and crazy, so I'm not going to get, I was, I was like, she deserves

39:46.680 --> 39:51.400
a plus 20 on that until I thought about Janice Ruth in that situation, which is like, what

39:51.400 --> 39:53.480
the fuck are you talking about, dude?

39:53.960 --> 40:02.200
Uh, so go ahead and, uh, we'll just go straight up and down and roll that persuade.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.120
Um, 15 on a 40 persuade.

40:06.120 --> 40:06.760
Excellent.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.320
Excellent.

40:07.880 --> 40:12.280
Uh, she turns around, puts her hand behind her back.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.440
Is that a threat?

40:14.440 --> 40:15.320
It's not a threat.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.320
It's a warning and it goes for all of you.

40:17.320 --> 40:22.120
And she looks at the Carl who's crying and, um, and everyone in the room is just like,

40:22.120 --> 40:23.000
nobody leaves.

40:23.560 --> 40:27.720
I have reason to believe that there's something really wrong going on here.

40:27.720 --> 40:33.000
When you look down, you notice that, uh, the floor is just white and tile and there's some

40:33.000 --> 40:36.680
dirt spread around it, but you don't see anything else anymore.

40:36.680 --> 40:42.200
Cause you've taken your eyes off the ground and, uh, we're going to head back to the top

40:42.200 --> 40:43.160
of the order with Jerome.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.400
Jerome's like, come on, Carl, it's going to be okay.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.440
It's going to be okay.

40:46.440 --> 40:46.840
All right.

40:46.840 --> 40:47.560
Stay with me.

40:47.560 --> 40:48.120
Stay with me.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.560
Like a car that won't start.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.600
And, uh, Charles, what are you doing?

40:54.600 --> 40:54.920
Okay.

40:54.920 --> 40:59.720
So I'm feeling very confident with your confidence.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.040
Sorry.

41:00.040 --> 41:05.080
Just to give you a quick rundown, Janice turned her back to you when she turned to talk to

41:05.080 --> 41:06.040
Dr. Miller.

41:06.040 --> 41:10.040
When she put her hand behind her back, you see that she's reaching for a gun that is

41:10.040 --> 41:12.440
in her like waistband.

41:12.440 --> 41:12.840
Okay.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.200
And you are literally within arm's reach of both.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.000
You can grab her hand, you can grab her wrist, you can grab her gun, you can punch your butt.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.160
Well, okay.

41:21.160 --> 41:26.280
I think I'll use my, I would like to talk and move at the same time and humans typically

41:26.280 --> 41:26.680
do that.

41:26.680 --> 41:27.720
You can definitely do that.

41:27.720 --> 41:27.960
Okay.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.240
You're like, what can I do?

41:31.240 --> 41:32.200
What can I do in this game?

41:32.200 --> 41:33.640
It's kind of two things at once.

41:33.640 --> 41:33.880
Yeah.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.480
Talking, talking is always like kind of a free action.

41:37.480 --> 41:37.960
Freebie.

41:37.960 --> 41:38.200
Yeah.

41:38.200 --> 41:38.760
Okay.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.560
So I am action wise.

41:41.560 --> 41:46.040
I am using my athletics to reach for the gun.

41:46.040 --> 41:46.360
Okay.

41:46.360 --> 41:49.000
And also I'm going to do like a, I can picture this.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.920
So she's turned around and I'm going to stick my leg between her legs and then wrap it around

41:54.920 --> 41:57.000
one and get her down to a kneeling position.

41:57.720 --> 41:58.280
Okay.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.240
Yeah, that's rad.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.560
Go ahead and roll athletics.

42:01.560 --> 42:06.760
This is like a wrestling move or, um, I guess athletics.

42:07.720 --> 42:12.600
I mean, if you want to give me something I have higher in like unarmed combat actually

42:12.600 --> 42:13.720
is probably closer.

42:13.720 --> 42:14.440
That's lower though.

42:14.440 --> 42:14.680
Yeah.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.160
Go ahead and roll.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.480
I'm going to go ahead and roll athletics.

42:19.800 --> 42:20.600
You know what?

42:20.600 --> 42:21.240
I'm going to go.

42:24.920 --> 42:29.480
I pass either one 39 on a 40 or on a 50 or a 60.

42:29.480 --> 42:29.800
Whoa.

42:32.680 --> 42:33.400
All right.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.280
The jig is up.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.080
What the fuck is going on here?

42:37.080 --> 42:39.320
I turned to Jerome.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.720
You got to fill us in, bro.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.160
Like this shit's crazy.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.360
Absolutely no idea.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.720
This was a goddamn Bigfoot five minutes ago.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.520
Well then how the fuck did it turn into a little boy?

42:50.520 --> 42:52.040
I'm not a doctor.

42:52.040 --> 42:55.080
And you both just like whip pan turn to the other two.

42:56.680 --> 43:01.560
I think someone should look to see if there is security footage so we can see a transformation.

43:01.560 --> 43:02.600
Did I skip Dr.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.480
Hooch's turn?

43:03.480 --> 43:04.040
Yes.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.840
Allie, you didn't speak up at all.

43:06.840 --> 43:07.560
I thought I went.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.400
I was like, I guess I go after Taylor.

43:09.400 --> 43:12.040
I guess I, I guess I lost rock, paper, scissors.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.400
I forgot I won rock, paper, scissors.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.800
I forgot to, you know, have you go next.

43:17.800 --> 43:18.600
So it's your turn.

43:19.560 --> 43:19.960
Okay.

43:19.960 --> 43:24.680
So I, now that things are getting a little more out of hand with these two civilians,

43:24.680 --> 43:31.320
I look directly at Doreen and then I glance over at the cauldron in the corner so that

43:31.320 --> 43:33.160
she knows she needs to go get it.

43:33.160 --> 43:36.040
And I'm still like hovering over the body playing Dr.

43:36.040 --> 43:36.760
Anne Folsom.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.360
I'm so sorry.

43:38.360 --> 43:41.880
I, if you could hold, just everyone hold for a moment.

43:42.520 --> 43:45.240
My Pro Tools is not responding and I'm having a heart attack.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.200
Oh, you're doing great.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.600
What do you use your Pro Tools for?

43:48.600 --> 43:49.560
Recording.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.800
Oh, that's bad.

43:51.800 --> 43:52.300
Yeah.

43:52.680 --> 43:53.180
Oh no.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.360
Yep.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.080
I just realized.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.480
Hey guys, it's all still there.

43:57.480 --> 44:06.680
It literally did full not responding white screen and then boom, back to fully in motion.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.720
Can you imagine?

44:11.720 --> 44:12.520
Oh my God.

44:12.520 --> 44:13.000
Let's get this man a shot.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.400
I had to rerecord an entire, two entire episodes once.

44:18.120 --> 44:18.620
No.

44:19.880 --> 44:26.440
That it was like, it was like a very cool finale, like all the revelations and it's

44:26.680 --> 44:28.760
like gone.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.920
That fucking sucks.

44:30.920 --> 44:31.240
Yeah.

44:31.240 --> 44:34.840
But it actually, the second time around was better because then they could rehearse.

44:34.840 --> 44:35.960
Yeah, of course.

44:35.960 --> 44:36.460
Yep.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.080
Yeah.

44:37.080 --> 44:40.840
We recorded, we rerecorded our first episode because it was the first time we were ever

44:40.840 --> 44:44.200
on mic and we finished and we were like, that sucked.

44:46.920 --> 44:47.640
All right.

44:47.640 --> 44:53.800
Let's move on to, well, if I'm being honest, didn't hear a goddamn word you said Allie.

44:53.800 --> 44:58.520
So I'm still doctor who just still hovering over the body playing and fall some playing

44:58.520 --> 45:03.400
doctor, but she looks over her shoulder directly at Doreen and then looks over at the cauldron

45:03.400 --> 45:05.560
to let Doreen know that she needs to go grab that.

45:05.560 --> 45:05.800
Yes.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.400
Go ahead and roll alertness for me.

45:07.400 --> 45:07.900
Okay.

45:09.400 --> 45:09.640
Damn.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.480
Why'd you give me such a low alertness?

45:11.480 --> 45:11.640
Yeah.

45:11.640 --> 45:12.200
Sorry, dude.

45:12.760 --> 45:13.320
Wait.

45:13.320 --> 45:13.960
Holy shit.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.520
Is that a great success?

45:16.520 --> 45:18.200
No, 11 would be.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.200
Oh, what does it mean?

45:20.200 --> 45:21.560
It means you passed.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.040
Oh, okay.

45:22.040 --> 45:22.760
I pass.

45:22.760 --> 45:23.400
Congrats.

45:23.400 --> 45:23.960
Thank you.

45:23.960 --> 45:24.680
Uh, okay.

45:24.680 --> 45:28.440
Instead of leaving, instead of leaving the room this time, Lindsay and Taylor, just take

45:28.440 --> 45:29.240
off your headphones.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.240
And then if you just like put your fingers in your ears and wiggle them a little bit,

45:34.520 --> 45:35.800
maybe don't make that noise.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.040
Dr.

45:40.040 --> 45:40.680
Hooch.

45:40.680 --> 45:41.080
Yeah.

45:41.080 --> 45:50.440
As you look at Doreen, Marine, you see that there is a small tick on the ground that is

45:50.440 --> 45:58.440
crawling directly towards the military boots that are planted firmly on the ground in

45:58.440 --> 45:59.480
between Doreen.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.440
I don't know why I'm describing her feet so weird.

46:03.480 --> 46:04.600
It's heading toward her boots.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.520
It's a small tick.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.680
I need you to roll sanity.

46:09.240 --> 46:09.480
Okay.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.360
It's just a bug.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.440
You got 71 on a 55.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.280
Oh, it's probably not just a bug.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.720
You're going to lose one sanity.

46:18.600 --> 46:19.480
You've seen ticks.

46:20.360 --> 46:24.520
Ticks don't have that many legs, Dr.

46:24.520 --> 46:25.320
Hooch.

46:25.320 --> 46:32.920
This thing basically is floating as a wild amount of legs, but also seemingly a changing

46:32.920 --> 46:39.160
amount of legs carries this thing as if it's floating just off the ground directly toward

46:39.160 --> 46:39.800
Doreen Marine.

46:39.800 --> 46:45.480
As you, as you, uh, point at her and then give her the eyes, you know, over to, over

46:45.480 --> 46:46.840
to the vial.

46:46.840 --> 46:48.280
Do I get another action?

46:48.600 --> 46:50.120
Because you failed your sanity?

46:50.760 --> 46:53.880
No, but you do see this thing.

46:53.880 --> 46:59.000
And so the knowledge that you possess and making the move toward Marine of having her,

46:59.000 --> 47:00.840
which is handy that you're telling her to move.

47:02.040 --> 47:02.760
Yeah, I guess.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.440
That does work out quite well for you.

47:05.320 --> 47:05.960
Okay.

47:05.960 --> 47:06.460
Okay.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.420
Okay.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.320
Understood.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.760
Hey, did you fucking get me?

47:10.760 --> 47:11.400
All right.

47:11.400 --> 47:11.640
Yeah.

47:11.640 --> 47:15.320
So I motion to Doreen Marine to go over to the cauldron in the corner.

47:15.320 --> 47:18.520
The cauldron to get the, uh, the sleepy time medicine.

47:18.520 --> 47:19.720
Banana time.

47:19.720 --> 47:22.440
It's fucking banana time.

47:23.240 --> 47:30.840
Uh, and with that, I need everyone else to roll sanity.

47:30.840 --> 47:34.680
So Charles, Doreen, Dr.

47:34.680 --> 47:36.040
Miller, go ahead and roll.

47:36.840 --> 47:37.480
Alertness.

47:37.480 --> 47:37.980
Sorry.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.880
Did I say alertness or sanity?

47:39.880 --> 47:40.440
You said sanity.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.320
Oh, alertness.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.120
Roll alertness.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.320
Thank God.

47:43.320 --> 47:48.200
Because if it was sanity, I would have crit failed, but I crit success.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.880
44.

47:51.880 --> 47:52.840
Congratulations.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.840
Yeah, that was a real turnaround.

47:54.840 --> 47:55.240
Lindsay.

47:55.800 --> 47:58.680
51 on a 70.

47:58.680 --> 47:59.880
Oh, success.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.680
And Dr.

48:00.680 --> 48:03.560
Miller fail 34 on a 20.

48:03.560 --> 48:03.800
Dr.

48:03.800 --> 48:09.800
Miller seems to be looking all around on the floor, trying to find something that she may

48:09.800 --> 48:13.160
have seen previously, but is now lost Doreen.

48:13.160 --> 48:18.040
You see it right in front of your boots on the ground, crawling toward you.

48:18.040 --> 48:24.120
And Charles, you also see this little, little creature.

48:24.120 --> 48:28.600
Um, no, go ahead and roll a sanity, both Charles and Doreen.

48:28.600 --> 48:29.960
Why is sanity so low?

48:32.760 --> 48:35.320
Yeah, I failed 4259.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.600
Oh, that's a success.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.680
So, uh, you have so much sanity.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.080
I only lost one earlier when you lost like five.

48:43.080 --> 48:43.320
Okay.

48:43.320 --> 48:43.640
Sorry.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.080
Lindsay, take off your headphones again.

48:45.080 --> 48:46.440
As you just, oh wait, no, hold on.

48:46.440 --> 48:46.920
Sorry.

48:46.920 --> 48:48.200
Keep them on just for a moment.

48:48.200 --> 48:48.680
Listen to me.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.200
Listen to the words coming out of my mouth.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.320
You see just a tick.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.840
There's just a tick on the ground.

48:52.840 --> 48:53.480
It's normal.

48:53.480 --> 48:54.200
You're out in the woods.

48:54.200 --> 48:54.840
There's a tick.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.360
There's, you know, sometimes there's crickets.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.400
Sometimes there's ants.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.800
No, it's just like a normal tick.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.240
I mean, ticks are not great.

49:01.240 --> 49:04.440
You don't want it to be near your foot, I suppose, but that's all you see.

49:04.440 --> 49:05.400
You take off your headphones.

49:05.400 --> 49:05.960
No big deal.

49:05.960 --> 49:12.520
Hey, uh, Chuckster, this thing has so many goddamn legs.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.840
Uh, like this is not a tick.

49:14.840 --> 49:20.280
This is, it looks like a tick, but it's almost like floating off the ground with how many

49:20.280 --> 49:23.000
legs it has and the number of legs keeps changing.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.400
And like with the critical success on the alertness, you actually notice that it is

49:27.400 --> 49:34.200
almost like forming and reforming in different spots around like as it's moving toward Terrain's

49:34.200 --> 49:34.760
boot.

49:34.760 --> 49:35.800
I can picture that.

49:35.960 --> 49:36.840
Yeah, me too.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.360
Good storytelling.

49:40.360 --> 49:41.560
Oh, hey, thanks dude.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.080
I love you.

49:45.080 --> 49:45.800
Love you too.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.000
Shut up.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.920
Get a room.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.320
I'm so jealous of Lindsay.

49:53.320 --> 49:54.440
She gets to close her ears.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.480
Lindsay, they're saying bad things about you.

49:59.480 --> 50:00.520
And Lindsay's back.

50:03.480 --> 50:04.760
I messed up on the fun.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.600
You have no idea how lucky you are.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.560
Doreen, it's your turn.

50:07.560 --> 50:08.040
What do you do?

50:08.040 --> 50:09.240
I'm going for the cauldron.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.000
Hey Zach, do I have to lose sanity points?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.280
Yeah, just lose one.

50:12.280 --> 50:12.780
Okay.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.200
Thanks for asking.

50:15.000 --> 50:15.960
You did have homework.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.240
The rest of the class groans.

50:20.440 --> 50:21.880
Roll dexterity.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.140
Okay.

50:28.760 --> 50:29.260
God.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.040
Zero on.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.600
I'm sorry, you rolled zero?

50:34.600 --> 50:37.640
I rolled double zero.

50:37.640 --> 50:38.140
Hey guys.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.720
All right, so double zero means 100.

50:47.240 --> 50:51.400
100 is literally the worst thing you can roll in this game.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.400
And Zach, what did you roll?

50:53.400 --> 50:57.720
And this was a contest and I rolled a 38.

50:57.720 --> 50:58.760
You rolled a 100.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.280
So yeah, pretty easy.

51:02.280 --> 51:05.080
You move over to the cauldron in the corner.

51:05.080 --> 51:05.560
What do you do?

51:05.560 --> 51:06.520
Do I know what this is for?

51:06.520 --> 51:11.560
Do I know that this cauldron is like a potion that you've made that will knock them out?

51:11.560 --> 51:16.360
I mean, all I've done is go out, bring it in, and then look at you and look at it.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.200
So I grab it and I look at you.

51:18.200 --> 51:21.640
I just glance over at Janice Ruth.

51:21.640 --> 51:25.560
At this time, real quick, Ellie, if you could take off your headphones as well.

51:26.360 --> 51:30.040
Lindsay and Ally, take off your headphones and plug your ears.

51:30.600 --> 51:31.320
Me, it's me.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.600
Hey Taylor.

51:34.600 --> 51:35.640
Yeah, what's up?

51:35.640 --> 51:36.440
What's up, bro?

51:36.440 --> 51:37.560
You're my favorite.

51:37.560 --> 51:38.920
I love you so much.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.080
Should we pause like every five minutes to do this?

51:41.080 --> 51:42.200
Yeah, it's really fun.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.400
All right, should we get them back?

51:45.080 --> 51:45.880
Are you serious?

51:47.560 --> 51:54.200
Because you critically succeeded on your alertness check to see this weird fucking seemingly

51:54.200 --> 51:56.920
unnatural otherworldly bug.

51:57.880 --> 52:03.800
You also notice it, you know how I described how it like kind of blips in and out?

52:04.920 --> 52:13.560
It seems to blip a couple times as it jumps and it slides directly down into the military

52:13.560 --> 52:20.360
boots of one Doreen Marine and disappears into her boot.

52:20.360 --> 52:26.840
You process that information finally when she's across the room and has grabbed this

52:27.720 --> 52:32.680
cauldron, you finally think to yourself like, holy shit, that thing just like disappeared

52:32.680 --> 52:33.560
into her boot.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.680
That's so weird.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.080
And am I allowed to do anything or just know it?

52:37.080 --> 52:39.640
You just have to know that for now.

52:39.640 --> 52:40.520
I can't yell out?

52:41.800 --> 52:43.480
Let her act first if that's cool.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.880
We don't want to interrupt her.

52:45.880 --> 52:47.480
She seems to have something fun to do.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.400
I think she's excited about it.

52:49.400 --> 52:49.880
What do you think?

52:52.600 --> 52:53.720
All right, let's get it back.

52:53.720 --> 52:54.680
All right, come back.

52:54.680 --> 52:55.320
All right.

52:55.320 --> 52:59.000
Hold on, I have to wipe the earwax off my fingers onto my pants.

53:00.440 --> 53:01.880
Everyone stop what you're doing.

53:06.440 --> 53:09.720
This is the most grossed out I've ever been recording the show.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.000
And he records with Luke and Thomas.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.280
I'm so honored.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.240
No mention of Joe there.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.120
That's interesting.

53:20.120 --> 53:20.760
Joe's a saint.

53:25.720 --> 53:26.680
Yeah, no, no big deal.

53:31.400 --> 53:32.520
Doreen Marine, what do you do?

53:33.160 --> 53:39.640
I made eyes with Rusty Hooch, who just looks at Janice, right?

53:39.640 --> 53:41.160
I'm going to head towards Janice.

53:41.160 --> 53:47.720
And I think my plan is to just like try and like, as if she were my cat or my dog, just

53:47.720 --> 53:51.720
like pry her mouth open and give her some of this and like rubber throat to get her

53:51.720 --> 53:52.360
to swallow.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.240
As you're doing that.

53:57.240 --> 54:00.440
Doreen, pour it in your boot.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.800
So I poured in my boot, not all of it.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.600
Whoa, what the fuck?

54:08.600 --> 54:09.640
So trusting.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.160
Wow, so trusting.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.440
That's amazing.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.280
He seems pretty sure of himself.

54:14.280 --> 54:18.440
And also like, and once I became Charles, everyone just was like, wow, there's just

54:18.440 --> 54:19.320
something about him.

54:19.320 --> 54:20.600
I just trust him.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.840
He pulled that move where he got the gun.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.640
Charles in charge of our taste.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.840
Now recording.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.200
Now recording.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.800
You are now being recorded.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.760
That's how I'm going to laugh for this episode.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.120
If you guys are cool with that.

54:45.480 --> 54:46.600
Only if I can laugh like.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.080
That's a satisfying mic sound.

54:51.480 --> 54:53.640
That was dick-sucking sound.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.480
Satisfying.

54:57.480 --> 54:57.880
All right.

55:51.080 --> 56:08.920
Let's go.

56:21.080 --> 56:37.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

56:37.080 --> 56:41.080
Till they chase you out again

56:41.080 --> 56:47.080
Find your feet on your broken bones

56:47.080 --> 56:57.080
Clear out the edge again

57:17.080 --> 57:37.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

57:37.080 --> 57:57.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

57:57.080 --> 58:17.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

58:17.080 --> 58:37.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

58:37.080 --> 58:57.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

58:57.080 --> 59:21.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

59:21.080 --> 59:41.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

59:41.080 --> 01:00:01.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:29.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:53.080
Falling fast into a deep abyss
