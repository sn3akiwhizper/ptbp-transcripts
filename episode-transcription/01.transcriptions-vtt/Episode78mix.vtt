WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.560
I'm feeling like a damn sandwich here, y'all.

00:03.560 --> 00:07.880
I am the meat that is between the good numbers six and nine,

00:07.880 --> 00:10.600
the bridge between the celestial numerals

00:10.600 --> 00:13.320
that make us all feel so nice.

00:13.320 --> 00:16.560
That's right, y'all, this is episode 78.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.680
And I'm building a bridge of vocal vibrations

00:20.680 --> 00:25.000
live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.040
The numbers always tell the truth,

00:28.080 --> 00:31.000
especially when they are the good numbers,

00:31.000 --> 00:32.500
the nice numbers.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.800
Speaking of numbers, we got one special message

00:35.800 --> 00:38.600
from one very special listener.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.000
This week's Howler with Wolf is from Zach,

00:41.000 --> 00:42.640
who tagged that pretending pod

00:42.640 --> 00:45.080
on his Instagram story for once.

00:45.080 --> 00:45.960
He writes,

00:45.960 --> 00:49.880
Hey Wolf, long time listener, first time Howler.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.880
Howler howls.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.760
Did you do it?

00:56.760 --> 00:57.920
Did you howl?

00:58.920 --> 01:02.360
Okay, now I want to hear you do a real long howl.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.160
And it starts real confident,

01:04.160 --> 01:07.400
like you're the only wolf in the whole dumpster.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.280
But then as the howl goes on,

01:09.280 --> 01:12.180
you become less and less sure of yourself.

01:12.180 --> 01:15.040
Like you're stoned and underdressed at a wedding

01:15.040 --> 01:18.600
that you weren't invited to until like the week before

01:18.600 --> 01:21.140
when you ran into your old friend's fiance

01:21.140 --> 01:22.360
at the coffee shop.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.580
And she invited you after acting

01:24.580 --> 01:26.360
like it was a total accident.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.360
You were left off the guest list in the first place.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.200
Now, do that now.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.880
Okay, thanks, love you, bye.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.840
P.S. Hey Joe, Justin, Luke, and Thomas,

01:36.840 --> 01:40.680
I think y'all pretty funny and nice and cute to boot.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.100
Now listen here, Zachary.

01:43.100 --> 01:46.560
I do not howl on command for any man,

01:46.560 --> 01:49.520
except for beautiful trash beings

01:49.520 --> 01:52.760
who wish to roll in the filth with me, you dig?

01:52.760 --> 01:55.280
I've also never been invited to a wedding,

01:55.280 --> 01:56.840
but that has never stopped me

01:56.840 --> 01:59.280
from enjoying myself to the fullest.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.160
Full of love, full of trash, forever and evermore.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.480
That sounds like holy matrimony to me, y'all.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.400
Emphasis on the moan.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.960
I love you too, Zach.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.360
And one day I will eat your soul,

02:13.360 --> 02:17.320
but before I do, I'll give you a little forehead kiss.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.920
Stop it, stop what you're doing right now.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.360
Pull over the car, dry off those hands,

02:22.360 --> 02:24.840
and put down the damn quesadilla.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.400
Go to Twitter, search at pretending pod.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.000
Go to Instagram, search at pretending pod.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's literally the exact same thing

02:32.000 --> 02:34.160
that Jesus told his bro-mies.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.280
Put down the quesadilla and follow me.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.360
Or keep just listening, I guess,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.880
but don't disappoint ol' Wolfie like that.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.720
Tell your online friends about the show

02:44.720 --> 02:47.160
and tag at pretending pod.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.920
In terms of perspective,

02:48.920 --> 02:50.960
let's try to look at this from Drew's.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.560
It's time for the news.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.600
Drew drove to the city in the midst

02:54.600 --> 02:56.880
of a reconstruction of contention

02:56.880 --> 02:59.000
that implemented puddle teaming,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.880
the act of placing small man-made pools

03:01.880 --> 03:03.720
filled with fish around town.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.800
Drew admitted he didn't come up with this plan.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.000
Rather, it was Pastor Adam Kane

03:09.000 --> 03:12.240
who has seemingly assumed control of contention.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.840
Drew went on to say the pastor

03:13.840 --> 03:16.600
was using fish to collect the ooze.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.880
Drew chastised the officers for leaving contention

03:19.920 --> 03:23.120
during this phenomenally strange and harrowing time,

03:23.120 --> 03:25.320
but John Lee Pettymore the 3rd

03:25.320 --> 03:28.560
saw a vision of Drew bringing the radio, helmet,

03:28.560 --> 03:30.320
and briefcase full of money

03:30.320 --> 03:32.320
to the First Church of Contention,

03:32.320 --> 03:36.040
and he freaked out on Drew for turning on his coworkers

03:36.040 --> 03:39.800
until Drew showed them a round scar on his belly

03:39.800 --> 03:42.120
from where he had been tortured.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.880
When they patted down Drew,

03:43.880 --> 03:46.480
they found a bloody piece of cheap carpet.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.600
Drew told them, deadpan,

03:48.600 --> 03:51.280
that choking on the carpet until he almost died

03:51.280 --> 03:52.800
was how he found them.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.960
It didn't take long

03:53.960 --> 03:56.440
for the former contingent police officers

03:56.440 --> 03:57.920
to torture Drew as well,

03:57.920 --> 03:59.680
asking him to prove his assertion

03:59.680 --> 04:02.560
by telling them where Tildy B. Mitchell is.

04:02.560 --> 04:06.360
He said he saw only a small dark prison in his vision.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.840
John went batshit and tried to pull off his own head.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.680
Clark chased after him,

04:11.680 --> 04:15.080
and Tyler, Kerry Page's energetic black lab,

04:15.120 --> 04:18.240
came bounding toward the group from behind a barn,

04:18.240 --> 04:21.120
taking us now to Clark's oldest loose end.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.840
Honk if you know this, Wolf's boldest goose friend.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.080
It's a brand new hit, a lone crack tone.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.280
It's kazoo with no backbone.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.200
Here we go.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.600
Oh, yeah, it's a new episode.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.440
Yeah, it's a new episode.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.160
We have to record a new episode now.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.920
Oh, behind the scenes.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.740
Everybody listening out there.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.720
It hasn't been a whole week

05:14.720 --> 05:16.940
since we recorded the last episode.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.120
Nope.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.040
What have you guys been up to

05:20.040 --> 05:21.760
since we recorded the last episode?

05:21.760 --> 05:23.180
It feels like it's been a week.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.180
I've been reading drill tweets.

05:25.180 --> 05:27.680
I took a stroll over the restroom over there

05:27.680 --> 05:29.040
and came back.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.400
It was a good jaunt.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.280
I've just been on Reddit.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.040
I opened up another bubbly.

05:33.040 --> 05:33.880
What flavor?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.320
It's aha, it's strawberry cucumber.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.240
Who makes aha?

05:37.240 --> 05:38.320
Who makes aha?

05:38.320 --> 05:39.160
I don't care.

05:39.160 --> 05:39.980
What do you have, Joe?

05:41.080 --> 05:44.460
I bought cranberry raspberry flavored La Croix.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.920
I haven't tried it yet, though,

05:45.920 --> 05:47.680
but I hadn't seen that flavor before.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.760
I haven't seen that either.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.200
Yeah, cran-raz.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.840
Just so you know, it's the Coca-Cola company.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.280
Hey, will you crack one right now?

05:54.280 --> 05:57.160
I could've sworn that the package said cran-raz,

05:57.160 --> 05:59.800
but this says razz cranberry.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.400
It did a reverse of the thing.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.240
I don't know why.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.480
Here we go.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.600
Oh!

06:05.600 --> 06:06.760
Ooh, that's a crisp one

06:06.760 --> 06:08.040
ripping the head off of that bad boy.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.480
Oh, it's foaming everywhere.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.000
Oh my God, Joe is just pouring it all over his forehead

06:13.000 --> 06:16.160
while he shakes his golden locks back and forth.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.000
Wow.

06:19.180 --> 06:20.020
It's good.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.800
And welcome to episode 78

06:21.800 --> 06:25.320
here at Pretending To Be People.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.480
You guys have had a week to think on what happened

06:27.480 --> 06:28.440
in the last episode.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.880
Any thoughts pop up?

06:30.880 --> 06:33.080
I'm worried that you're gonna make me play Tyler

06:33.080 --> 06:35.280
and Clark at the same time.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.040
So I've been preparing.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.160
I've been going in and out of character as fast as I can.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
Can we see some of that?

06:41.160 --> 06:42.000
No.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.440
Just a little taste.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.240
It's good to see the Contingent Boys.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.120
Good to see you too, Tyler.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.880
See, I've been practicing.

06:55.880 --> 06:56.720
It's flawless, right?

06:56.720 --> 06:59.360
Contrast really makes Clark Bishop's voice.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.480
John Wayne-y?

07:03.640 --> 07:04.640
Wayne-y.

07:04.640 --> 07:05.960
Didn't we just leave the city?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.400
How did Tyler get up here?

07:07.400 --> 07:10.360
We pulled over, I think, outside Contingent.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.680
It was like a dirt road, right?

07:11.680 --> 07:13.800
Yeah, you guys were like halfway there, maybe.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.480
He did make some distance though, it sounds like.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.720
Yeah, what, like 30 miles?

07:17.720 --> 07:20.520
When we did our Contingent Critter Coalition,

07:20.520 --> 07:22.120
was that the date?

07:22.120 --> 07:23.960
What date did that take place on?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.000
Do you remember?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.460
I think it was December 5th.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.060
What day is it today?

07:28.060 --> 07:29.820
I think it's December 6th.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.940
Well, Luke, it's been a whole week since the last episode.

07:31.940 --> 07:33.700
What have you thought about in the past week

07:33.700 --> 07:37.820
about what is happening and what you should do on this one?

07:37.820 --> 07:38.940
You know, not much.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.540
Probably be more mean to Drew.

07:44.540 --> 07:47.860
Were you mean to Drew back in the day, five days ago?

07:47.860 --> 07:49.140
Not really, no.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.580
I wasn't trying to be mean to him,

07:50.580 --> 07:52.660
I was just more interested in the case than his whole being.

07:52.660 --> 07:56.340
Yeah, you've seen a lot of misery and despair at this point.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.620
Misery signals.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.780
Okie doke, I'm ready to make shit up as I go.

08:02.660 --> 08:06.260
Alrighty, well you guys are in the misery business,

08:06.260 --> 08:09.700
so let's open up shop.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.160
Tyler!

08:11.160 --> 08:13.780
Is that Tyler?

08:13.780 --> 08:15.620
That's Karen Page's dog, that's, guys,

08:15.620 --> 08:17.800
that's the dog I was supposed to find.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.340
That's it, it's right there.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.920
I pat Clark in the back and says,

08:20.920 --> 08:22.380
looks like you found him.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.700
Mission accomplished, we can go home now.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.060
Hey Drew, how do you know who Tyler is?

08:27.060 --> 08:30.540
You all can see Drew Andrews

08:30.540 --> 08:35.540
just filled brimming with affection.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.620
Well, Tyler's just the greatest dog in the world

08:38.620 --> 08:41.420
and I could've sworn that he'd been eaten by homeless people

08:41.420 --> 08:46.420
but, I mean, he's Councilman Kerry Page's dog, right?

08:46.580 --> 08:48.300
Drew, that's correct, it's weird though

08:48.300 --> 08:51.500
because she floated the same homeless thing

08:51.500 --> 08:52.420
that you just said.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.580
Oh yeah, I guess I remember you telling me about that.

08:55.580 --> 08:58.100
I'm confused though, how did you know this dog was Tyler?

08:58.100 --> 09:02.660
John, I mean, I did put signs all over the neighborhood.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.980
He probably saw it on the copier or something.

09:04.980 --> 09:07.320
It just seems like you know this dog.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.540
Is that accurate, Drew?

09:08.540 --> 09:12.580
Well, yeah, it's like Clark said,

09:12.580 --> 09:14.980
I saw the pictures on the copier.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.420
Humant!

09:16.420 --> 09:17.820
Okay, everybody roll humant.

09:17.860 --> 09:18.700
Yeah.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.220
Pass.

09:23.220 --> 09:24.340
Ah, 11.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.460
62 on 80.

09:26.460 --> 09:30.300
I fail a 78 on a 30.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.740
Okay, I'm gonna kick you out, Drew.

09:31.740 --> 09:32.580
Okay.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.040
Hey, Luke and Thomas.

09:40.040 --> 09:40.880
Yo.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.700
Zach.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.260
Thomas, John Lee Pettymore especially,

09:43.260 --> 09:46.140
when you hear Drew talking about Tyler,

09:46.860 --> 09:49.660
it's not Drew, that's not Drew talking about Tyler.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.380
It's not his voice, it's not his cadence.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.620
I mean, it is his voice,

09:53.620 --> 09:56.820
but it's not his personality that's coming through.

09:56.820 --> 09:58.300
Damn it, didn't I spend 10 luck

09:58.300 --> 10:00.900
to try to figure out if this was Drew or not?

10:02.100 --> 10:06.460
Yeah, well, I guess actually it was more so

10:06.460 --> 10:10.560
like you asked if you could trust Drew

10:10.560 --> 10:15.060
and I answered that question more so

10:15.100 --> 10:19.380
instead of like, is it Drew as a question?

10:19.380 --> 10:20.980
Whatever, I made my choice.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.500
Okay, let's get Joe back in here.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.480
Drew, Drew, you seem awfully fond of a dog

10:34.480 --> 10:37.160
that you saw on a poster.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.060
He's probably just happy

10:38.060 --> 10:40.180
that I'm able to close my case, guys.

10:40.180 --> 10:43.220
Yes, yeah, it's definitely that I'm happy for Clark Bishop

10:43.220 --> 10:46.420
because he was really worried about not finding that dog

10:46.420 --> 10:50.480
because Councilwoman Carrie Pages is a very respected person

10:50.480 --> 10:53.180
in the contention community.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.300
Thank you not to interrupt me right now, please.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.140
Drew, you would not have known that that was Tyler

10:58.140 --> 11:01.100
based off a black and white picture from a poster.

11:01.100 --> 11:05.740
That could be any dog, this doesn't add up.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.140
Well, it's a black lab and it's a black and white picture.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.020
I feel like that doesn't discredit it.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.420
It's less that you recognize the dog

11:12.460 --> 11:15.900
and it's more that you seem to know about this dog

11:15.900 --> 11:17.140
that you've never met.

11:17.140 --> 11:18.860
You seem to have genuine affection

11:18.860 --> 11:21.580
for a dog you've only seen on a poster.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.180
Well, Councilwoman Carrie Pages

11:23.180 --> 11:25.260
is an excellent member of our community

11:25.260 --> 11:28.020
and the fact that she has a dog means that that dog

11:28.020 --> 11:29.580
must be one of the greatest dogs

11:29.580 --> 11:32.020
that could be around for sure.

11:32.020 --> 11:32.840
Hey, Carrie.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.680
Yeah, what?

11:36.100 --> 11:39.580
And as Keith Vigna says, Carrie and Drew says,

11:39.580 --> 11:42.800
what, Clark Bishop's eyes widen.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.980
I need everybody to roll sanity.

11:47.140 --> 11:47.980
What?

11:47.980 --> 11:49.820
Fail, but not over my power.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.780
Fail, not over my power.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.740
I also fail, but not over my power.

11:54.740 --> 11:59.740
Everybody lose one sanity as Tyler runs up to Drew Andrews.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.120
I believe still in handcuffs.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.900
Oh yeah, he's still in handcuffs.

12:04.900 --> 12:09.180
Drew gets down on his knees and starts like nuzzling

12:09.780 --> 12:13.820
as Tyler runs right up and begins kissing

12:13.820 --> 12:16.140
and licking all over Drew Andrews.

12:16.140 --> 12:19.940
Drew, Tyler really does know you pretty well.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.180
This ain't Drew, Clark.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.260
They called, yeah, you, what?

12:24.260 --> 12:26.460
Councilwoman Pages, how the hell did you get

12:26.460 --> 12:27.760
in the body of our associate?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.800
Clark's eyes widen even further.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.580
What, what?

12:32.580 --> 12:35.440
I am simply here to bring back the three of you

12:35.440 --> 12:38.360
to contention and I didn't think that this was gonna be

12:38.400 --> 12:39.360
that much of an issue.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.360
Jesus, it's like with you people

12:41.360 --> 12:43.280
and I'm just glad that Tyler is here.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.020
If you would, if you would just come back,

12:46.020 --> 12:47.920
I think we could do a lot of good together.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.660
It's just that we needed your help

12:50.660 --> 12:53.800
and we didn't know exactly how to get it

12:53.800 --> 12:58.800
and so we just need, we figured Drew might be the best way

13:00.120 --> 13:01.540
to get you guys to come back.

13:01.540 --> 13:02.760
I don't know about these guys,

13:02.760 --> 13:06.300
but I don't take very kindly to tricks being played on me.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.440
I'm sorry.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.500
Yeah, what do you guys think?

13:09.500 --> 13:10.340
I don't like it.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.200
Clark looks like he's trying to do

13:12.200 --> 13:13.900
a lot of math in his head.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.400
How did you get switched?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.280
Yeah, how did you become Drew?

13:18.280 --> 13:19.520
The radio.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.440
Right, that makes sense.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.960
Where's Drew then?

13:23.960 --> 13:24.800
Is he okay?

13:24.800 --> 13:28.520
You see a flicker in Drew's eyes.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.800
If you ever wanna see Drew Andrews again,

13:30.800 --> 13:32.920
you're gonna come back to contention with me.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.420
So you tortured poor Drew and he wouldn't flip on us.

13:38.260 --> 13:41.060
So you had to switch his body with yours?

13:41.060 --> 13:42.020
Is that what happened?

13:42.020 --> 13:43.580
He shrugs his shoulders.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.300
I poke the wound.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.500
Yeah, I was gonna say I punch him in the gut

13:47.500 --> 13:48.500
where that wound was.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.500
Poke and punch, same time.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.340
No, God.

13:53.420 --> 13:56.260
Please, please don't hurt me.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.180
Please don't hurt me, I'll do it.

13:58.180 --> 14:01.200
I'll even act like you guys don't even know Drew anymore.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.280
I didn't think about this.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.820
There's three of you, there's only one of me.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.420
Please just don't hurt Tyler

14:05.420 --> 14:07.060
and we could all go back to contention

14:07.700 --> 14:08.660
and I can help you, I can help you.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.660
I can help you, thank you.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.800
Council woman, first of all, we're not gonna hurt Tyler,

14:12.800 --> 14:15.260
but we might take him away from you forever.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.380
Well, that would be hurting him

14:16.380 --> 14:17.980
because we're so connected.

14:17.980 --> 14:18.820
I don't know.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.700
I think he'd be real happy

14:20.700 --> 14:22.980
after we fed him steaks for a few days.

14:22.980 --> 14:23.820
You wouldn't.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.500
He might forget all about you.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.420
Drew starts crying.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.140
Council woman, now,

14:28.140 --> 14:30.380
why don't you tell us what the preacher wants?

14:30.380 --> 14:32.740
I already told you, we're just trying to help.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.740
Can I humid that?

14:34.740 --> 14:35.580
No.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.400
All right, go ahead and roll.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.400
Keith.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.920
64 on 80.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.100
Well, okay, so he's trying to collect all the residue, right?

14:44.100 --> 14:46.880
So that there's no more out in contention

14:46.880 --> 14:49.600
so that we can pull away all the puddles

14:49.600 --> 14:52.400
and we can open up contention again.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.000
You think he just wants to collect the residue

14:55.000 --> 14:56.920
and then do nothing with it?

14:56.920 --> 14:59.400
How can he keep it safe, contained?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.040
I'm not in charge of that.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.640
I think we gotta go talk to this guy.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.200
You never stopped to think, did you?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.160
Drew, I mean, Carrie?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.040
Drew, Carrie?

15:08.040 --> 15:08.880
Drew, Drew, Drew.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.700
Drew, Drew, Drew.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.540
Drew, Drew, Drew.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.380
Drew, Drew, Drew.

15:11.380 --> 15:12.220
Drew, Drew, Drew.

15:12.220 --> 15:13.960
I was trying not to laugh.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.500
Welcome to pretending to be people

15:15.500 --> 15:18.340
where everything is made up and the roles don't matter.

15:18.340 --> 15:23.340
You got put into the body of Drew

15:24.480 --> 15:27.640
with a radio that had tubes on it

15:27.640 --> 15:31.320
by, I assume, Pastor Adam Kane.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.840
Was this all just like a Tuesday afternoon for you?

15:34.840 --> 15:36.440
How did you react to all the...

15:36.440 --> 15:39.560
Are you aware of the world around you

15:39.560 --> 15:40.760
that you've now entered?

15:41.820 --> 15:43.960
Oh, I think she's aware, Clark.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.480
You've been with the pastor for quite a while, haven't you?

15:46.480 --> 15:48.660
Well, when you guys weren't doing anything,

15:48.660 --> 15:50.520
we decided that we needed to team up

15:50.520 --> 15:52.920
to make change happen, something substantial

15:52.920 --> 15:56.080
that could actually take care of business in this time.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.880
I don't like this excuse.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.100
I don't like that line of reasoning at all.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.120
Carrie, walk me through the day

16:02.120 --> 16:04.120
that Pastor Adam Kane said to you,

16:04.240 --> 16:07.440
I need you to switch bodies with this guy here

16:07.440 --> 16:08.520
using this radio.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.360
How did that set with you?

16:09.360 --> 16:10.480
That was just earlier today,

16:10.480 --> 16:13.520
and honestly, I'm pretty heads in at that point,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.880
so I don't know if you've noticed,

16:15.880 --> 16:17.960
but the world is different now,

16:17.960 --> 16:21.480
and you either adapt or you die.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.400
Oh, we know.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.040
I lean in and whisper,

16:25.040 --> 16:28.440
is this because I couldn't find your dog soon enough?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.160
Is this because of me?

16:30.200 --> 16:34.520
Clark, I have no ill will against you

16:34.520 --> 16:36.080
now that my dog is back.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.900
All right, so how about this?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.640
What if we, you know,

16:40.660 --> 16:42.480
we're gonna send Tyler away,

16:42.480 --> 16:44.520
somewhere where you can never find him

16:44.520 --> 16:45.640
and you'll never see him again.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.720
Now, we're not gonna hurt him,

16:46.720 --> 16:51.160
but yeah, unless you become a mole for us.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.280
That's what I said I would do.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.920
Yes, we're on the same page.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.260
Well, I know. It was your idea.

16:56.260 --> 16:57.520
It was your idea. Okay, I love it.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.720
It can be your idea too.

16:58.760 --> 16:59.680
I just want you to know

16:59.680 --> 17:02.480
that that's the leverage we have against you,

17:02.480 --> 17:04.680
is that you won't ever see your dog again.

17:04.680 --> 17:09.680
This brief reunion will be merely a painful moment in time

17:10.280 --> 17:12.600
in which you get to see what might've been.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.020
Drew and Tyler have their heads,

17:14.020 --> 17:17.280
their foreheads pressed right up against each other.

17:17.280 --> 17:22.200
Drew kind of like does one final push into Tyler's forehead

17:22.200 --> 17:24.360
and then leans back and looks you dead in the eyes

17:24.360 --> 17:27.200
and is like, I will do anything to be,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.200
I will do anything to keep Tyler safe.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.320
That's what I like to hear.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.400
Boys, I think we ought to head back to contention.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.760
It sounds like there's even more trouble brewing down there.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.960
Oh, hey, why don't you tell us how you got this car?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.320
We know it's not yours.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.160
It was in the police department parking lot.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.960
Yeah, old Trent left it there.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.000
I think Grand Theft Auto is,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.640
or tampering with a motor vehicle

17:47.640 --> 17:49.840
is the least of our concern right now.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.300
I'm gonna put Drew Carey in the back of the car,

17:53.660 --> 17:57.580
get back in the passenger seat and look at the guys.

17:57.580 --> 17:58.420
Who's driving?

17:58.420 --> 17:59.580
Let's put her in the trunk

17:59.580 --> 18:01.040
and put the dog in the front seat.

18:01.040 --> 18:01.880
Okay.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.440
I love that.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.280
I'll drive.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.740
Are you keeping Drew tied up?

18:06.740 --> 18:07.980
Are you keeping him handcuffed?

18:07.980 --> 18:08.820
Yes.

18:08.820 --> 18:09.780
And are you doing anything with his legs?

18:09.780 --> 18:10.700
Leg cuffed.

18:10.700 --> 18:11.540
Yep.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.360
Oh, damn.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.540
It seems like that might cause more trouble than it helps.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.020
He's gonna be able to be mobile when we get places.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.520
Yeah, when we get places.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.500
We're driving back, we're halfway to contention.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.100
You afraid he's gonna walk out of the trunk?

18:23.740 --> 18:24.580
If he's got his legs,

18:24.580 --> 18:25.860
he might be able to kick his way out.

18:25.860 --> 18:27.620
But if we leg cuff him,

18:27.620 --> 18:30.500
then all he can do is wiggle like an ineffective worm

18:30.500 --> 18:31.340
back there.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.100
Handcuffs with attached ankle cuffs

18:35.100 --> 18:37.380
were pretty common in the 70s.

18:37.380 --> 18:41.060
So that's what Clark has on his old school

18:41.060 --> 18:42.980
contention police officer uniform.

18:46.980 --> 18:47.820
I got these here.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.420
I'm imagining handcuffs on his wrist,

18:49.420 --> 18:50.500
handcuffs on his ankles,

18:50.500 --> 18:53.260
and then two handcuffs connecting those handcuffs

18:53.260 --> 18:55.780
like behind his back like a hog tied.

18:55.780 --> 18:56.620
Yeah.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.500
Rigged and ready to go.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.660
Boys, can we go to my hotel?

19:02.660 --> 19:04.580
There's something I really need to show you.

19:04.580 --> 19:05.660
Yeah, we're driving now.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.800
We're in charge of our own destinies.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.380
Of course we can do that.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.580
Do you guys have any other plans?

19:11.580 --> 19:13.780
We're gonna have to deal with the pastor at some point,

19:13.780 --> 19:16.420
but I've been meaning to get back

19:16.420 --> 19:18.400
and show you guys this for a minute.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.380
Let's just do it.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.500
Yeah, that's fine, sure.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.280
And I gotta let Bean out.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.040
He's probably ripped up the carpet

19:28.040 --> 19:29.360
or peed and pooped in there.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.060
I don't know if he even has food left.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.360
We should probably give your dog

19:32.360 --> 19:33.760
to someone who's gonna take care of it.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.900
Him and Tyler can go to a farm.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.260
Not really though, I love Bean.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.220
All right, let's go to contention.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.000
The highway between the city

19:44.000 --> 19:46.080
and the small town of contention,

19:46.080 --> 19:48.200
if it truly can be called a highway,

19:48.840 --> 19:49.680
the part nearest to contention

19:49.680 --> 19:52.580
hasn't seen road repair in decades.

19:52.580 --> 19:56.160
Those from contention know to forfeit the radio

19:56.160 --> 19:57.780
during certain stretches of road

19:57.780 --> 20:01.280
because the rough old concrete is so loud,

20:01.280 --> 20:03.720
the damage to the speakers as well as to your ears

20:03.720 --> 20:05.560
is never worth it.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.480
That's just something you're all used to.

20:07.480 --> 20:11.160
What you're not used to is a blockade

20:11.160 --> 20:16.160
made of splintered church pews stopping you from exiting

20:16.720 --> 20:21.720
and the sign from Subtropolis torn down and spray painted.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.560
It's like leaning up against this blockade,

20:25.560 --> 20:27.920
has a big arrow to the right and says,

20:27.920 --> 20:30.480
detour, please keep right.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.620
I need you all to roll alertness or search,

20:34.620 --> 20:36.760
whichever's higher or Thomas, you can roll drive

20:36.760 --> 20:38.600
if that one's higher in order to see this

20:38.600 --> 20:39.680
in time to do anything about it.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.880
I slow down and I wanna say that

20:41.880 --> 20:43.300
I feel like this is a trap.

20:45.100 --> 20:45.940
I fail.

20:46.580 --> 20:47.620
I rolled a six on a 60.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.460
I rolled a 35 on a 70 drive.

20:49.460 --> 20:53.760
So I just, I slow to a stop before we have to turn off

20:53.760 --> 20:55.920
and I say something doesn't feel right.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.060
I think we're about to get children of mend.

20:58.060 --> 21:02.520
In the distance, you see that the detour leads down

21:02.520 --> 21:06.600
some crunchy December grass and onto the service road,

21:06.600 --> 21:10.780
just to the right, just to the north of the exit ramp.

21:10.780 --> 21:13.440
But there is certainly some sort of situation

21:13.440 --> 21:15.300
set up on this service road.

21:15.340 --> 21:19.980
A crane sits off to the side of this makeshift entrance

21:19.980 --> 21:20.960
to contention.

21:20.960 --> 21:24.460
It's boom and jib hanging over the middle of the road

21:24.460 --> 21:26.680
where its payload sits.

21:26.680 --> 21:31.600
A substitute gate made of those big ass construction tubes.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.800
So basically the crane is there to let cars into contention

21:34.800 --> 21:38.360
by lifting all these tubes.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.800
Like sauna tubes, the kind of things you fill with concrete?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.600
No, the big concrete.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.360
Big plastic tubes.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.100
If we were in the matrix and we shot them,

21:46.100 --> 21:47.900
they would go rolling across the road

21:47.900 --> 21:50.260
and cars would crash into them.

21:50.260 --> 21:51.100
Gotcha.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.140
But the highway itself is clear.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.400
It's just the exit ramp that has all this construction

21:55.400 --> 21:56.240
going on, right?

21:56.240 --> 21:58.320
So we could keep going down the highway unobstructed,

21:58.320 --> 22:00.320
come around maybe the backside or something like that.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.100
So yeah, we just keep driving.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.080
Fuck the detour.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.500
We look for a back way into town.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.340
Yeah.

22:06.340 --> 22:08.300
Or at least one that doesn't have a giant crane in the way.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.260
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

22:09.260 --> 22:10.460
If this is the main entrance,

22:10.460 --> 22:12.100
then it stands to reason that the others

22:12.120 --> 22:15.040
are probably less secure than this.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.400
That's what I'm hoping at least, yeah.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.240
It's worth scouting.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.780
Plus we're the cops and unless the pastor

22:19.780 --> 22:22.300
has explicitly said to not let us in.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.400
We know this town doesn't feel too kindly

22:24.400 --> 22:25.280
about us right now.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.880
I think we're the cops is about the worst thing

22:28.880 --> 22:32.160
that could come out of anyone's mouth trying to get in.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.660
Like why the fuck did you leave?

22:34.660 --> 22:37.300
Why aren't you here in the first place?

22:37.300 --> 22:38.520
But doesn't it kind of sound like

22:38.520 --> 22:41.480
Pastor Adam Cain's running the show now and he wants us?

22:41.700 --> 22:43.660
If we could not alert him to our presence,

22:43.660 --> 22:44.900
that'd be the best for now.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.020
I agree 100%.

22:46.020 --> 22:49.020
I'm just saying I think if push came to shove,

22:49.020 --> 22:51.100
we could probably get through this barrier.

22:51.100 --> 22:55.580
Let's try to find another way around and get to my hotel.

22:55.580 --> 22:58.780
So if you could all pull up the map real quick.

22:58.780 --> 22:59.900
Yeah, I've got the map.

22:59.900 --> 23:03.820
I want you to see essentially why Hotel Motel

23:03.820 --> 23:06.300
might be one of the harder places to get into.

23:06.300 --> 23:07.860
I see what you mean.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.580
Yeah, it's right by the exit.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.620
We don't have to drive anywhere.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.240
Let's just pull, let's go back down the highway

23:14.240 --> 23:15.920
the way we came a little bit,

23:15.920 --> 23:17.160
pull off the side of the road

23:17.160 --> 23:19.880
and then just walk to the Hotel Motel.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.080
Yeah, that works.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.160
Are you leaving Tyler in the car?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.060
No, we're leaving Drew Carey in the trunk,

23:25.060 --> 23:26.600
but we're taking Tyler with us.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.760
You don't think we should take Drew Carey with us?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.480
We hogtied him pretty good.

23:31.480 --> 23:32.880
Wasn't our whole conversation though,

23:32.880 --> 23:37.880
was that she was gonna be on our side and help us now

23:38.880 --> 23:40.980
because we threatened her dog.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.620
But I don't know, I mean,

23:43.620 --> 23:46.320
it just seems like she's more of a liability

23:46.320 --> 23:48.220
while we run a dude Drew's thing real quick.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.060
You mean Keith's thing?

23:49.060 --> 23:51.780
Yeah, it feels like the safest place for her to be

23:51.780 --> 23:52.820
would be in this trunk.

23:52.820 --> 23:55.540
I'm just saying we're not gonna be at the hotel for long.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.340
Yeah, we're just missing in and out.

23:57.340 --> 23:58.900
I just gotta get something.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.740
Okay, yeah.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.620
You can, somebody can stay here and guard,

24:02.620 --> 24:07.620
guard him, them if you want, but I don't know.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.900
Let's just all go and make it real quick

24:10.900 --> 24:12.340
and get back to the car.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.300
Here's my only fear,

24:13.300 --> 24:15.060
is that things don't seem to go well for us.

24:15.060 --> 24:19.380
So what if Drew Carey's trapped in the trunk for a while?

24:19.380 --> 24:22.800
Well, that's her own fault for becoming, you know,

24:22.800 --> 24:26.580
a pawn of this evil goo like a collecting pastor.

24:26.580 --> 24:29.300
But we also were just saying that she could be helpful.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.960
Like, are we abandoning the idea

24:30.960 --> 24:32.700
that that could be helpful to us?

24:32.700 --> 24:35.220
Right now, I think she's the most helpful in that trunk.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.420
If she feels like she's in a situation

24:37.960 --> 24:39.320
where we're leading her,

24:39.320 --> 24:41.000
trying to be stealthy to the hotel,

24:41.000 --> 24:42.100
and she can just scream like,

24:42.100 --> 24:43.880
hey, hey, they're here,

24:43.880 --> 24:46.160
and sick a bunch of people on us.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.000
True.

24:47.000 --> 24:47.820
That's true.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.040
True, true.

24:49.040 --> 24:49.880
Okay.

24:49.880 --> 24:50.700
All right, that's it.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.540
Let's go.

24:51.540 --> 24:56.120
Let's go to the hotel on foot with Tyler, right?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.040
We're bringing Tyler with us?

24:57.040 --> 24:57.880
Yeah.

24:57.880 --> 24:58.700
Yeah.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.080
Clark goes around to the trunk and pats on it.

25:00.080 --> 25:00.920
We'll be right back.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.000
We're taking Tyler, so don't get any funny ideas

25:03.000 --> 25:04.240
about getting out of there.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.720
Wait, where are you going right now?

25:05.720 --> 25:06.540
Please, thank you.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.720
Tell me, please.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.560
Nope, nope.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.380
We don't want you,

25:09.380 --> 25:12.000
if any of your friends come along and find this truck,

25:12.000 --> 25:13.840
we don't want you leading them to us,

25:13.840 --> 25:17.860
so we'll be back within 15 minutes, half an hour,

25:17.860 --> 25:19.160
and you just sit tight.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.960
Clark's gonna be staying here with you,

25:21.960 --> 25:23.280
and then I wink at them.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.800
And I'm putting some headphones in,

25:25.800 --> 25:27.920
and I'm just gonna sit silently to myself

25:27.920 --> 25:28.760
in the front seat up there.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.520
Yeah, he's listening to an audio book,

25:30.520 --> 25:32.360
so you don't disturb him or anything,

25:32.360 --> 25:34.120
or he won't be able to enjoy that.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.080
Great job.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.040
That's exactly right.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.120
You just don't say nothing.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.400
All right, let's go, boys.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.240
Boy.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.440
I meant Keith and Tyler.

25:44.440 --> 25:49.440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.360
And then we all head off to the hotel motel.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.660
Is there anything in the car we can use

25:53.660 --> 25:55.920
to make a makeshift leash for Tyler?

25:55.920 --> 25:57.480
Oh, for sure, seat belt.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.040
There's a light cardigan in the back,

25:59.040 --> 26:02.260
and I tie that around his collar.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.480
One sleeve tied around the collar,

26:03.480 --> 26:05.360
the other sleeve I'm holding on to.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.200
Okay.

26:06.780 --> 26:07.620
Cardigan leash.

26:07.620 --> 26:08.660
Cardigan leash.

26:08.660 --> 26:09.500
I love it.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.820
All right, Keith, you know,

26:11.820 --> 26:13.540
I probably should have humanted you

26:13.540 --> 26:15.940
or done something to make sure

26:15.940 --> 26:18.500
that your motives were good and leaning us

26:18.500 --> 26:21.860
away from our main goals back to your hotel room.

26:21.860 --> 26:24.900
But I didn't, so let's just get this over with.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.860
Okey-dokey, who's got the worst stealth?

26:26.860 --> 26:28.060
Mine's 50.

26:28.060 --> 26:29.100
Mine's 10.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.380
Oh my God.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.220
Why?

26:31.220 --> 26:32.520
I've got 30.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.100
Okay, so I'm gonna have John and Clark roll

26:36.880 --> 26:39.520
if you guys succeed, you'll be able to assist

26:39.520 --> 26:43.680
by giving a plus 20 each on a success to Keith.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.520
10.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.400
So that is a plus 20 to Keith's 10.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.520
I failed, a 40.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.720
All right, Keith, you're gonna roll under 30.

26:53.900 --> 26:54.740
83.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.600
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, John Lee,

27:02.700 --> 27:05.380
Pettymore the 3rd, and Tyler

27:06.860 --> 27:11.660
are walking across the highway.

27:11.660 --> 27:15.700
I need everybody to roll alertness.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.140
32 on a 60.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.500
90 on a 60.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.380
87 on a 70.

27:24.380 --> 27:29.380
All righty, just got Thomas here.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.280
Thomas, you see across the highway

27:36.280 --> 27:38.360
when you're like on the highway itself,

27:38.360 --> 27:40.280
it's the highest point that you've been at.

27:40.280 --> 27:44.160
And looking across the town of contention,

27:44.160 --> 27:46.800
there's not much of a skyline in contention, right?

27:46.800 --> 27:49.020
Not too many tall buildings here,

27:49.020 --> 27:53.760
but you do notice that surrounding what you know

27:54.060 --> 27:56.740
as the campus of First Church of Contention,

27:56.740 --> 28:00.180
there is, that doesn't look right, it can't,

28:00.180 --> 28:02.220
it's moving, it's a wall.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.700
You imagine this is what it looked like

28:04.700 --> 28:08.260
if Moses actually had parted the Red Sea,

28:08.260 --> 28:12.900
as you see a moat in the air that is surrounding

28:12.900 --> 28:15.960
the campus of the First Church of Contention.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.780
And in the water are many different kinds of fish

28:19.780 --> 28:22.140
that are all swimming about.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.520
I need you to roll sanity.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.120
Ooh, fail.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.600
Lose one sanity as you realize

28:28.600 --> 28:30.200
what you are going up against.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.520
This is the kind of unnatural

28:33.520 --> 28:37.080
that you have not witnessed something this controlled,

28:37.080 --> 28:39.080
right, like everything that you've seen

28:39.080 --> 28:42.940
has been just haphazard, seemingly chaotic.

28:42.940 --> 28:47.240
But this, this was formed and this is held.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.360
This is scary.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.340
That's what you're supposed to do in horror, right?

28:52.340 --> 28:54.420
Is you say, this is scary.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.260
This is scary.

28:56.260 --> 28:57.380
You're scared now.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.900
Do you feel it inside of you where you're scared?

29:01.900 --> 29:02.740
Oh yeah.

29:04.580 --> 29:07.060
All right, I'm gonna, did you roll over your power?

29:07.060 --> 29:07.940
No.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.580
Okay, I'm gonna bring them back.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.140
Sorry, I forgot to tell you guys

29:17.140 --> 29:19.020
I was putting you in the waiting room.

29:19.920 --> 29:24.920
Well, and they should have just been there because.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
Yeah, immediately.

29:26.560 --> 29:31.480
Yeah, I stop at my track and I tap you on the shoulders

29:31.480 --> 29:33.760
and point to the first church of contention

29:33.760 --> 29:36.320
and I say, hey guys, take a look

29:36.320 --> 29:38.040
at what's going on around the church.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.640
Both of you roll sanity for me.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.720
For looking at the church?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.120
Yep.

29:42.120 --> 29:42.960
I fail.

29:45.960 --> 29:46.780
I fail.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.880
Do you fail over your power either one of you?

29:49.700 --> 29:50.540
No.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.820
So you each lose one sanity.

29:52.820 --> 29:54.340
How close to the church are we?

29:54.340 --> 29:57.220
Quite a ways from the church.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.180
Okay, I see it on the map now.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.020
I mean 20 blocks maybe?

30:01.020 --> 30:01.840
Yeah.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.220
Or like five.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.140
Oh yeah, like five blocks, sorry.

30:06.140 --> 30:09.100
Above the skyline of contention,

30:09.100 --> 30:11.020
which is basically non-existent,

30:11.020 --> 30:14.320
I think the highest thing in the town previous to this

30:14.320 --> 30:17.180
was probably the church's cross

30:17.200 --> 30:19.480
on top of their steeple.

30:19.480 --> 30:24.480
Currently above that, you see a massive wall of water

30:26.800 --> 30:31.560
that is surrounding the entire land that the church sits on

30:31.560 --> 30:36.560
and it is exactly like what you think it might look like

30:36.840 --> 30:41.840
if you made a wall out of water.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.680
Yeah, exactly.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.640
It's exactly what it would look like

30:43.640 --> 30:44.880
if you made a wall out of water

30:44.880 --> 30:46.760
and there are fish swimming all through it

30:47.540 --> 30:50.820
it's cool some of them literally jump out of the water

30:50.820 --> 30:54.380
and then gravity pulls them back in sideways

30:54.380 --> 30:56.580
into the wall of water.

30:56.580 --> 31:00.420
And oh, I forgot to mention, it's scary.

31:03.660 --> 31:07.140
You've never seen this kind of unnatural power

31:07.140 --> 31:09.100
controlled like this.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.820
It seems to not be chaotic, it is purposeful.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.580
Clark starts walking toward it.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.100
Clark, what are you doing?

31:17.100 --> 31:19.400
You didn't, did you see all that?

31:19.400 --> 31:23.720
There's fish in there, they're just flopping around.

31:23.720 --> 31:26.120
Look at that, I gotta see this thing.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.960
Yeah, I mean, let's just swing by the hotel real quick

31:29.960 --> 31:32.040
and then we can go there.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.560
Yeah, Clark, that's kind of where all our,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.080
seemingly all our enemies are.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.020
I mean, except our human enemies,

31:40.020 --> 31:41.800
the ooze is its own thing.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.460
Yeah, see, Tyler agrees.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.820
We should just go run by the hotel real quick

31:45.820 --> 31:46.660
and check things out.

31:46.660 --> 31:48.740
But you're saying that we'll be able to get up there

31:48.740 --> 31:50.020
close to it later on maybe.

31:50.020 --> 31:50.860
Yeah, yeah.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.380
See some of those fish.

31:52.380 --> 31:54.540
Oh yeah, we'll take them fish.

31:54.540 --> 31:55.920
That'd be neat as hell.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.860
All right, yeah, let's go.

31:56.860 --> 31:59.620
A regular ichthyologist is Clark Bishop.

31:59.620 --> 32:00.460
You know it.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.700
Pick the pace up a little bit

32:01.700 --> 32:04.980
and start more than jogging towards the hotel.

32:04.980 --> 32:05.820
Yeah, I follow.

32:05.820 --> 32:07.980
As you guys get to hotel motel

32:08.000 --> 32:12.120
you see that all the doors are open.

32:12.120 --> 32:15.200
I sprint to my room and in the parking lot.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.620
Look down here, it looks like a dog

32:17.620 --> 32:19.020
tried to get into this room.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.440
It looks like one burst from the inside outward

32:23.440 --> 32:24.280
in this one here.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.400
Yeah, can we reconstruct the series of events

32:26.400 --> 32:27.240
that happened here?

32:27.240 --> 32:30.160
It's several critters working together it seems.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
It looks like a bird hit the window here.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.820
Wow, this is something strange went on.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.760
Maybe it's, do I see a cat around anywhere?

32:38.380 --> 32:40.340
You guys are seeing that from a distance

32:40.340 --> 32:45.140
and just wonderfully ignoring the scene

32:45.140 --> 32:48.660
that's in the parking lot of hotel motel

32:48.660 --> 32:52.700
which before you is, there's a dunking booth

32:52.700 --> 32:56.580
filled with fish and sitting above the water

32:56.580 --> 33:01.180
there's a young boy, a large boy with dumpling cheeks

33:01.180 --> 33:05.580
and rounded ears that accentuate the roundness of his face

33:05.600 --> 33:08.680
and he is slowly surveying the area

33:08.680 --> 33:13.680
with a furrowed brow above glassy, darting eyes

33:14.000 --> 33:16.720
while consistently stuffing his face

33:16.720 --> 33:19.480
with a cheesy ziti scooped up

33:19.480 --> 33:21.920
from a mixing bowl in his lap.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.640
It seems like this husky fella is some kind of lookout.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.200
They said they were using children and crazy folks

33:29.200 --> 33:31.040
to look out for the ooze.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.720
And see he's got his little tank of fish there

33:32.720 --> 33:34.080
that he can just dump down into

33:34.940 --> 33:36.060
in case it comes by.

33:36.060 --> 33:38.080
Roll alertness for me, Thomas.

33:40.100 --> 33:40.940
Seven.

33:40.940 --> 33:44.500
And you notice alongside that astute observation

33:44.500 --> 33:48.140
there is a walkie talkie that is mounted

33:48.140 --> 33:50.700
on the netting of this dunk tank

33:50.700 --> 33:52.620
so that it could be used

33:52.620 --> 33:54.500
if someone was standing in the dunk tank.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.340
Walkie talkie.

33:55.340 --> 33:57.100
What's he, what's the kid wearing?

33:57.100 --> 33:58.140
What is the kid wearing?

33:58.140 --> 33:59.940
He is wearing.

33:59.940 --> 34:02.300
I'm mostly asking, is he wearing like a swimsuit

34:02.300 --> 34:04.020
so that he would be happy to be dunked

34:04.960 --> 34:07.040
or is he just wearing civilian clothing?

34:07.040 --> 34:08.920
No, he's just wearing normal clothes.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.080
What'd you say, Thomas?

34:10.080 --> 34:12.000
Said lack a week.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.160
Like Meatwad and some awkward teen hunger force.

34:15.160 --> 34:16.460
It's just a thing.

34:16.460 --> 34:17.960
So what happens?

34:19.120 --> 34:20.440
We tell you what happens.

34:23.320 --> 34:25.640
Hey fellas, see that walkie talkie he's got there?

34:25.640 --> 34:26.520
Yeah.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.560
Seems like he could alert the church to our presence

34:29.560 --> 34:31.760
so we might wanna, we might wanna duck down.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.920
How are we gonna sneak around him?

34:34.780 --> 34:35.620
Yeah, you could draw stealth.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.060
Is anybody feeling particularly sneaky?

34:40.060 --> 34:42.140
Is this a working carnival dunk tank?

34:42.140 --> 34:44.980
Like does it have a target that we could hit

34:44.980 --> 34:46.260
and dunk the kid?

34:46.260 --> 34:47.940
Yeah, let's say that it does.

34:47.940 --> 34:50.660
All right, can any of us throw?

34:50.660 --> 34:51.640
We could shoot.

34:53.340 --> 34:54.160
That's true.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.380
I've got a 60 firearms, what do you got?

34:57.380 --> 34:59.780
I'm feeling a little better than that.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.820
All right, Keith, take the shot.

35:01.820 --> 35:03.500
Well, I mean, what's your plan here?

35:04.040 --> 35:05.920
If we dunk him, he's gonna say that he got dunked

35:05.920 --> 35:07.160
and hurt a gunshot.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.920
Right, but it gives us time and his confusion to run by.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.940
He won't necessarily see what dunked him.

35:11.940 --> 35:12.780
That's true.

35:12.780 --> 35:15.280
And if you, you know, fuck up and hit the kid,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.760
then we don't really have a problem either way, so.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.600
That's true.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.720
But as a, just throwing it out there,

35:23.720 --> 35:26.720
another option is that we're here to get something

35:26.720 --> 35:27.560
from Keith. Just shoot the kid

35:27.560 --> 35:29.340
instead of fucking around with the dunk tank?

35:29.340 --> 35:30.800
You're right, you're right.

35:31.780 --> 35:33.260
Keith, why don't you,

35:33.260 --> 35:34.980
you're not wearing a uniform or anything.

35:34.980 --> 35:37.460
Why don't you walk up there, show him, I guess,

35:37.460 --> 35:38.900
your hotel room key or whatever.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.820
I mean, he's looking out for goo, right?

35:40.820 --> 35:43.640
I mean, that's ostensibly what he's looking out for.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.700
I could try to just obscure my face.

35:46.700 --> 35:49.140
Give me. Is Keith clean-shaven?

35:49.140 --> 35:52.700
Scraggly, but it's been a couple days since I shaved, so.

35:52.700 --> 35:55.540
I grab a big thing of mud and I just rub it

35:55.540 --> 35:57.860
all over your face where a beard would be.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.620
I allow it to happen.

35:59.620 --> 36:02.800
I have the mud beard on and I want to just quickly

36:02.800 --> 36:06.160
walk over to my hotel room.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.760
And if it helps, I do have some disguise points.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.240
Clark, you, me, and the dog will hunker down here

36:12.240 --> 36:13.920
and we'll see how Keith gets along.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.680
If he gets into any trouble with this boy,

36:15.680 --> 36:18.240
the boy's like, hey, that's Officer Vigna.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.720
You know, we'll dunk him or shoot him

36:19.720 --> 36:21.120
or do what we have to do.

36:21.120 --> 36:21.960
Exactly.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.820
We've taken care of kids before, so.

36:24.820 --> 36:29.820
Uh, I didn't know that.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.120
I thought you meant take care of him like we dunk him.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.600
I'm not, I don't think I want to kill a kid today.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.680
Like I said, whatever we have to do,

36:37.680 --> 36:39.880
I'm just, I'm glad you're my partner in this

36:39.880 --> 36:41.080
because we've been there before.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.160
We've done through, we've, you know,

36:42.160 --> 36:45.000
we've gone through this, so I know you'll do

36:45.000 --> 36:47.440
what must be done when the time comes.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.240
I didn't do it. I didn't do it last time.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.880
It was a thing that happened that we were there for,

36:51.880 --> 36:53.600
but I wasn't, like I would've,

36:53.600 --> 36:55.180
I would've preferred it not to have happened,

36:55.180 --> 36:57.460
but I, I'm with you.

36:57.460 --> 36:58.300
We're here.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.220
We're on the exact same page, buddy.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.100
I know you're with me, killer.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

37:05.900 --> 37:09.300
Keith, roll a disguise.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.540
There was a face of really happy

37:10.540 --> 37:12.220
and then a face of maybe shock.

37:12.220 --> 37:14.220
A 23 on a 30.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.100
Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

37:17.100 --> 37:20.460
As you walk by, you see these very glassy,

37:20.460 --> 37:23.380
very darting eyes of this total chub,

37:24.360 --> 37:28.280
look you up and down and then immediately pay you no mind

37:28.280 --> 37:31.040
as he continues to survey the land.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.820
And you walk into a room that has been ransacked.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.560
Bean is not here.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.400
Shit.

37:37.400 --> 37:41.000
And the window, as you all observed earlier,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.240
has been busted out.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.560
I immediately go directly to the safe.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.540
So, hotel safes, motel safes.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.520
I think you can just pick them up, right?

37:49.520 --> 37:50.400
Some of them.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.880
It depends, yep.

37:51.900 --> 37:54.340
So, Luke, how much luck do you have?

37:54.340 --> 37:55.160
35.

37:57.260 --> 37:58.100
That sucks.

37:58.100 --> 38:01.020
Go ahead and roll luck to see if your safe

38:01.020 --> 38:03.340
is in hotel motel.

38:03.340 --> 38:04.420
22.

38:04.420 --> 38:08.840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.260
And Bean is inside.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.940
Whew, I was gonna be so disappointed.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.940
I was too, honestly, I was gonna be pissed.

38:16.940 --> 38:17.900
I was like, please roll.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.620
Okay, crit, crit success, it is there.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.820
Yeah, I'm trying to think of something

38:23.820 --> 38:24.860
that would make it better.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.880
Oh, you don't have to, you don't have to,

38:27.880 --> 38:30.160
this kid is completely preoccupied

38:30.160 --> 38:31.200
when you come out with it.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.060
Like, he is. The safe?

38:33.060 --> 38:34.660
I'm like, I don't need the whole safe.

38:34.660 --> 38:35.780
Oh, right.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.260
Oh, shit, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

38:37.260 --> 38:39.980
I was like, okay, so Keith carries this safe out.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.380
Fuck me, so.

38:41.380 --> 38:43.140
Guys, look, the safe was still there.

38:43.140 --> 38:44.620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

38:44.620 --> 38:45.460
That's all I needed.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.300
We didn't take it.

38:46.300 --> 38:47.940
We could put stuff in it.

38:47.940 --> 38:49.180
Are you glad we came?

38:49.180 --> 38:51.440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.280
All right, do your thing.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.520
I open up the safe,

38:53.520 --> 38:56.400
take out the watch that I had put in there,

38:56.400 --> 38:59.200
I put it in my pocket, and I head back to the guys.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.640
Yeah, and this kid pays you absolutely no mind

39:02.640 --> 39:05.840
because of your critical success,

39:05.840 --> 39:07.400
and you make it back,

39:07.400 --> 39:10.080
and Tyler greets you with a warm lick on the face.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.560
Okay, guys, do you wanna walk to the church

39:12.560 --> 39:14.960
or go back to the car, but either way.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.400
Keith, why the fuck did we come out here in the first place?

39:17.400 --> 39:19.080
I need you to see something.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.180
Well, one of you guys put this on,

39:21.180 --> 39:24.420
and I reach into my pocket and hold out the watch.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.820
Yeah, sure, that's a nice watch, and I put it on.

39:26.820 --> 39:30.220
Okay, John Lee Pettymore the Thirth puts it on,

39:30.220 --> 39:32.120
and I'm gonna send the other two to the waiting room.

39:32.120 --> 39:32.960
Peace out.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

39:34.780 --> 39:39.780
Hey, Thomas.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.460
Hello, Zach.

39:44.460 --> 39:47.260
Thomas, it feels like the consciousness

39:47.260 --> 39:50.200
of John Lee Pettymore is changing the channel

39:50.200 --> 39:51.800
just like back and forth and back and forth

39:51.800 --> 39:53.340
all between these different scenes,

39:53.340 --> 39:56.240
and you begin to phase out of your reality

39:56.240 --> 39:59.220
as this watch slips onto your wrist,

39:59.220 --> 40:02.640
and you seem to be somewhere else entirely,

40:02.640 --> 40:07.640
and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers,

40:07.720 --> 40:12.660
and then the wet grass turns dry, so dry,

40:12.660 --> 40:14.640
and the dirt turns to dust,

40:14.640 --> 40:17.300
and you look up, and you see contention

40:17.300 --> 40:22.300
as an old mining town in the late 1800s,

40:22.780 --> 40:24.020
and you look next to you,

40:24.020 --> 40:27.600
and you see a man lying face down on the ground,

40:27.600 --> 40:30.800
not moving, and then all of a sudden,

40:30.800 --> 40:33.200
you're looking at a door in the ground,

40:33.200 --> 40:36.400
like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried,

40:37.340 --> 40:40.820
and on the door is an inscription,

40:40.820 --> 40:45.220
and it says, Pettymore Forevermore,

40:48.120 --> 40:51.880
and then the watch is slipped off of your wrist,

40:51.880 --> 40:54.760
and you come back to reality.

40:54.760 --> 40:59.440
John Lee Pettymore the third puts this watch on,

40:59.440 --> 41:02.880
and then quickly pulls the watch off his wrist.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.160
Keith, what the hell is this?

41:04.160 --> 41:05.000
What'd you see?

41:05.000 --> 41:05.820
What'd you see?

41:05.820 --> 41:06.760
What does that mean?

41:07.020 --> 41:11.060
I saw contention in its early days.

41:11.060 --> 41:13.900
I saw a man on the ground face down,

41:13.900 --> 41:15.800
and I saw a door.

41:15.800 --> 41:16.640
A door in the ground?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.940
A door in the ground, yeah.

41:18.940 --> 41:19.820
Did you read it?

41:19.820 --> 41:21.140
Did it say anything on it?

41:21.140 --> 41:23.980
It said, Pettymore Forevermore.

41:23.980 --> 41:27.860
When I put that on the first time,

41:27.860 --> 41:32.860
I saw a door in the ground, but it had beans on it.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
The door is just covered in beans.

41:38.680 --> 41:43.600
That watch, my father gave that watch to Ferguson as a kid.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.720
Why don't we see what happens when Clark puts it on,

41:45.720 --> 41:47.680
and I like slap it on your wrist.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.520
What do you mean?

41:48.520 --> 41:49.680
What do I, you guys are seeing?

41:53.200 --> 41:55.180
Bye guys.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.020
Look.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.560
Hey Joe.

42:03.560 --> 42:04.400
Hello.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.040
As Clark Bishop has this watch slapped on his wrist,

42:07.040 --> 42:09.640
it feels like your consciousness

42:09.640 --> 42:11.380
is just flipping through the channels,

42:11.380 --> 42:13.600
and you begin to phase out of your reality,

42:13.600 --> 42:15.920
and you're somewhere else entirely,

42:15.920 --> 42:20.620
and you feel wet grass and dirt on your fingers.

42:20.640 --> 42:25.640
The wet grass and dirt turns to dry, dry dust.

42:26.520 --> 42:30.760
And you've seen pictures of contention from the late 1800s,

42:30.760 --> 42:32.800
but you've never been there.

42:32.800 --> 42:36.000
And looking to your left, you see a man who's not moving

42:36.000 --> 42:37.880
face down on the ground next to you.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.360
You're back in this wet grass and dirt,

42:41.360 --> 42:43.960
and you see Maggie Cook's house,

42:43.960 --> 42:48.200
and in the backyard there's a door floating in the air.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.120
And then all of a sudden you're looking at this door

42:50.620 --> 42:53.980
that's mostly buried, sealed, metal door,

42:53.980 --> 42:56.180
and there's an inscription on it.

42:56.180 --> 43:01.060
It says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one,

43:01.060 --> 43:03.540
nine, five, five, one, eight,

43:04.420 --> 43:09.420
which you immediately can recognize as overseer.

43:11.060 --> 43:12.500
That's on the door in the ground?

43:12.500 --> 43:13.340
Yep.

43:13.340 --> 43:16.660
Okay, okay, okay.

43:16.660 --> 43:17.500
I don't get it, but okay.

43:17.500 --> 43:18.320
That makes sense.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.160
I mean, I kinda get it.

43:19.160 --> 43:20.000
I kinda get it.

43:26.380 --> 43:28.700
John Lee Pettymore slaps this watch

43:28.700 --> 43:31.900
onto Clark Bishop's wrist, and his eyes go blank,

43:31.900 --> 43:34.780
and then not hardly any time passes

43:34.780 --> 43:36.780
before the watch slips off the wrist

43:36.780 --> 43:38.380
and Clark Bishop looks at you.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.700
Did you see the door?

43:39.700 --> 43:40.740
What did yours say?

43:41.580 --> 43:44.980
Door, door, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:44.980 --> 43:47.780
It was the numbers, it was numbers, it was.

43:47.780 --> 43:48.620
What numbers?

43:49.700 --> 43:53.420
It was the ones they spelled overseer.

43:53.420 --> 43:55.020
Oh, shit, well, that's you, Clark.

43:55.020 --> 43:56.700
Was the door in the ground?

43:56.700 --> 43:58.140
Yeah, yeah.

43:58.140 --> 43:59.500
Did you see anything else?

43:59.500 --> 44:02.980
Yeah, I saw Maggie's house.

44:02.980 --> 44:05.020
I was standing out there in front of it.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.340
You know, she lives right there on Bean's Pond,

44:07.340 --> 44:12.340
and I saw a door, and it was floating above Bean's Pond,

44:13.100 --> 44:15.940
and then suddenly I was looking down at door in the ground,

44:15.940 --> 44:18.060
and that's where the numbers were.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.520
The numbers spelled out overseer,

44:21.520 --> 44:26.520
and I saw the dusty, it looked like really old contention,

44:27.040 --> 44:29.800
and there was that guy face down, like you said.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.800
When I was in the belly of that beast, I had a vision.

44:35.320 --> 44:39.260
Well, I saw my brother in Bean's Pond,

44:39.260 --> 44:40.640
but there was no water in it,

44:40.640 --> 44:43.020
and he was looking at a door in the ground

44:43.020 --> 44:44.720
in the bottom of Bean's Pond.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.040
If I interpreted my visions correctly,

44:47.780 --> 44:49.460
I think you're onto something.

44:49.460 --> 44:51.220
Bean's Pond is involved in some way.

44:51.220 --> 44:52.500
Before I brought it up,

44:52.500 --> 44:54.240
I wanted you guys to see that watch,

44:54.240 --> 44:56.700
but I think we need to go there.

44:56.700 --> 44:57.540
Yeah, I mean.

44:57.540 --> 44:59.420
What do you guys think is the bigger fish

44:59.420 --> 45:00.500
that we need to fry?

45:00.500 --> 45:03.440
Well, once the pastor knows we're here, he knows we're here,

45:03.440 --> 45:05.540
and we're not gonna be able to get much done.

45:05.540 --> 45:07.740
But we do need to save Drew from him.

45:07.740 --> 45:08.980
I don't know, boys.

45:08.980 --> 45:10.940
Maybe if we find the door, it'll help us.

45:10.940 --> 45:12.320
It's gotta mean something.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.300
If we happen to choose wrong,

45:14.320 --> 45:17.040
we'll hopefully just reset, right?

45:17.040 --> 45:17.880
I mean.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.160
We got all the time in the world.

45:19.160 --> 45:20.000
I would hope so.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.800
In increments of two hours every day.

45:21.800 --> 45:25.960
We never know when our last, you know, what if it stops?

45:27.600 --> 45:29.960
Well, we were lucky to have gotten this far, I think.

45:29.960 --> 45:30.800
You know.

45:30.800 --> 45:35.800
Really, any time after our first deaths is a blessing,

45:40.800 --> 45:44.000
so let's just be thankful for what we got,

45:44.820 --> 45:45.660
you know.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.980
Don't beat yourself up over losing something

45:47.980 --> 45:49.700
you don't even have yet, you know what I mean?

45:49.700 --> 45:52.980
Well, I mean, I think we oughta go find the doors.

45:52.980 --> 45:55.820
It's been on my mind for days.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.900
Yeah, let's fucking knock on these doors.

45:57.900 --> 46:00.180
So we're heading to Bean's Pond, eh?

46:00.180 --> 46:03.160
Yeah, and I mean, we gotta get to the bottom of it,

46:03.160 --> 46:06.940
but the water might be there, and I point to the wall.

46:06.940 --> 46:09.300
Have you put the watch on more than once, Keith?

46:09.300 --> 46:13.020
No, as soon as I put it on and I locked it up,

46:13.040 --> 46:14.760
as soon as I took it off.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.240
Okay, Zach, just in the interest of podcast time,

46:18.240 --> 46:20.400
if I put this on, will I have the same vision again

46:20.400 --> 46:21.520
or a different vision?

46:22.480 --> 46:23.960
That seems like a big question.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.200
I know, but if the answer is just the same,

46:26.200 --> 46:27.960
we can move right along, but.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.520
I think you have to say you'll do it, and then see what happens.

46:29.520 --> 46:33.560
Since you asked me that, here, give me that back,

46:33.560 --> 46:36.120
and I take the watch and put it on one more time.

46:36.120 --> 46:49.080
reality blinks and flickers in a now familiar but still unsettling way and you're standing

46:49.080 --> 46:56.740
over a man's body who's face down in the dry cracked dirt the smell of piss and shit wafts

46:56.740 --> 47:03.360
through the humid summer air and looking down the road to your perceived destination you

47:03.360 --> 47:10.800
recognize your hometown of contention back to the body on the ground your hands are trembling

47:10.800 --> 47:17.680
as you roll him over a dead man in his mid-20s stiff as a glass of moonshine dressed in the

47:17.680 --> 47:24.260
fashion of the day which is the late 1800s and a tri-folded piece of parchment falls

47:24.260 --> 47:31.000
out of this deceased man's jacket pocket it's a job advertisement for the contention mining

47:31.000 --> 47:40.840
company and it reads we is hiring able bodies readying untapped site plenty of work hesitate

47:40.840 --> 47:41.200
not

48:01.000 --> 48:16.160
try

48:31.000 --> 48:32.160
bye
