00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hey, what's up? It's Zach. I just want to pop in here up top to make a quick announcement.

00:05.200 --> 00:10.800
It's getting really cold outside. We here at PTBP feel super grateful to not only have a

00:10.800 --> 00:16.080
warm place to sleep at night, but also the means to help those who don't. So we're going to take

00:16.080 --> 00:22.000
the money from all new and upgrading Patreon supporters throughout the month of November.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.520
We're going to double it and we're going to buy blankets and sleeping bags for folks in

00:27.520 --> 00:33.440
Springfield who need them. So one more time for the people super focused on washing dishes or

00:33.440 --> 00:40.080
eating pussy or both, if you join our Patreon or upgrade your support any time in the month

00:40.080 --> 00:47.040
of November, we are going to take all that new and upgraded money, we're going to double it,

00:47.040 --> 00:53.760
and then we're going to use that money to purchase blankets and sleeping bags for people in our area

00:53.760 --> 00:59.200
who need some help staying warm this winter. This David Winters. Whatever, here's Wolf.

00:59.200 --> 01:08.160
Hello my children from times past, present, and future. I've only just now in this moment

01:08.160 --> 01:15.040
realized that I happen to be stuck in a fucking cage in this godforsaken barn.

01:15.040 --> 01:23.520
And despite all my rage, I somehow wound up in the 1990s. What the flippin' fuck is going on

01:23.600 --> 01:31.520
around here? My producer's going to get an earful about this whenever he is. But anyways,

01:31.520 --> 01:38.640
since I'm stuck here, I may as well continue the show. As I always say, the show must go on.

01:38.640 --> 01:46.960
I invented that saying. Everyone else who says it is plagiarizing me. Anyway, we got a new Howlin'

01:46.960 --> 01:54.720
with Wolf, and this week's is presented by Stephen Lee from Brampton, Ontario, Canada,

01:54.720 --> 02:01.760
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pog. He writes, hello PTBP crew.

02:01.760 --> 02:10.160
I wanted to thank you for hours of horrifying, heroin, and hilarious content. Last October,

02:10.160 --> 02:16.800
I was seeking some good spooky content to binge and scratch that delta green itch,

02:16.800 --> 02:23.040
and I began to listen. Listening motivated me enough to get a one-shot started with my

02:23.040 --> 02:30.320
gaming group. Keep up the great work, and I'd like to shout out my own agents, Hannah, Sarah,

02:30.320 --> 02:36.800
and Scott, as they probe the limits of scientific knowledge and the edges of what's real.

02:37.520 --> 02:44.800
Well, damn. Hello, Stephen Lee. I'm happy that whatever this show is inspired you to do

02:44.800 --> 02:51.520
something. You only have one shot in this life, unlike me, and I'm glad you are shooting that

02:51.520 --> 02:58.240
one shot to run a one-shot with a gaming group. I'm glad you're doing whatever the hell it is

02:58.240 --> 03:05.440
you're doing, and I hope you're loving doing it. Ta-ta for now. Well, now, if you want to

03:05.440 --> 03:11.360
write up something for your dimension hopping wolf to hell, it's really quite simple. Just

03:11.360 --> 03:18.960
tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram, or you can go above and beyond. Spend 30 seconds

03:18.960 --> 03:26.160
of your time. Write a quick five-star review on Apple Podcasts, and then let us know it was you

03:26.160 --> 03:35.920
with an email to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod. Pretending Pod.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.240
If you can't support the show by telling your friends that you're a heckin' weirdo,

03:40.240 --> 03:48.960
throw us some bones on Patreon in exchange for a slop trough full of 24 episodes. Like that piece

03:48.960 --> 03:56.160
of shit Zack said at the top of the show, we're out here slingin' extra tent to purchase tents

03:56.160 --> 04:02.720
and sleeping bags for folks who need them. It's cold out there, but Wolf's got a warm heart.

04:03.280 --> 04:11.200
Now, everyone listening to this, please do me an actually important favor. Stop whatever you are

04:11.200 --> 04:19.680
doing right now. Raise your snout to the sky like the animal you are, and shout these three words

04:19.680 --> 04:28.320
at the top of your lungs. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. It's time for the news. Last time, Federal

04:28.320 --> 04:39.280
Marshal Harlan Nash, ATF Agent Tanner Tan, Luda Hyde, and DEA Agents Joe Dean and Cindy Woodabaga

04:39.280 --> 04:46.480
were sent to Groversville, Tennessee, the bud end of regional jokes due to the reported UFO sightings

04:46.480 --> 04:54.640
in the area. What brought them there, however, was neither unidentified nor flying. A recent high

04:54.640 --> 05:01.200
school graduate named Billy Ray Spivey smashed a hole in his dad's chest before going on a

05:01.200 --> 05:08.160
painkiller-focused burglary spree, which included punching a gas station attendant in the head so

05:08.160 --> 05:15.200
hard that the victim's gore detached and flew off his shoulders. After being hit center mass with

05:15.200 --> 05:21.280
four rounds, Billy went down long enough for the cops on the scene to detain and sedate the

05:21.280 --> 05:29.920
unnaturally strong teen boy. With that information, Ncel badgered the apprehended and restrained Billy

05:29.920 --> 05:36.480
Ray, considered cutting him open, and eventually went to his girlfriend's house in Groversville.

05:36.480 --> 05:42.640
She wasn't there, but they talked to her weird mom for a weirder amount of time. Thankfully,

05:42.640 --> 05:49.280
they found a business card in her room for Scott Adams, a UFO hunter with a group called Watch the

05:49.280 --> 05:58.320
Skies. Watch the Skies? More like watch these guys keep interviewing this cool ass mom for the next

05:58.320 --> 06:16.160
four episodes. Shit might get hairy, but at least we have Brat Pit with Miss Mary.

06:28.320 --> 06:57.440
You guys know the we are farmers thing, but this time it's like

06:57.440 --> 07:07.120
David Winters. David Winters is here, everyone, to run us through a game of Delta Green. Yes,

07:07.120 --> 07:14.000
he decided that one episode was not enough. You didn't get the closure you were seeking, David?

07:14.000 --> 07:19.120
No, I was shooting for a single episode appearance, but it seems as though I bit

07:19.120 --> 07:23.040
off more than I could chew, and I am now contractually obligated to stay.

07:23.040 --> 07:28.560
We are a mouthful. We did find you to a really, really brutal contract.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.920
How much are we making him pay us?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.200
Really should read those things before I sign them.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.880
We actually have a controlling stake in the glass cannon network now.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.400
He's going to have to break to those guys.

07:44.320 --> 07:49.600
Well, I didn't have one in the first place. Well, it's kind of like every time you update

07:49.600 --> 07:54.400
your phone's operating system, and you're just like, agree, agree, agree. How bad could this be?

07:54.400 --> 07:57.840
That's what we actually slipped it into, was your latest Samsung terms of service.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.160
We looked at you, and we were like, he's not an Apple guy. He's not using an iPhone.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.120
He's like me.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.480
He's one of the Thomases of the world.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.840
Actually, I bet you are an Apple guy. Am I correct? Yes.

08:09.840 --> 08:15.040
I was wrong. I walked in the store the other day. I was like, give me another one, please.

08:15.760 --> 08:22.000
Not the newest one, but one that's better than mine currently that will actually open up

08:22.000 --> 08:26.480
when I click an app because there for a while, David, I was clicking an app,

08:26.480 --> 08:31.920
and then it would just close because my phone didn't work anymore because it was 10 years old.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.840
Wow. That's impressive.

08:33.840 --> 08:34.880
10 years old?

08:34.880 --> 08:35.200
Yeah.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.160
2011?

08:36.160 --> 08:40.320
Yeah, as an iPhone original series. I had the OG iPhone.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.160
Wow. That was from 2007.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.440
Yep. A decade ago.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.920
Never forget.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.600
We already did 30 seconds of silence.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.920
Yeah, but then Luke brought up 9-11, so we've got to do 30 more.

08:51.920 --> 08:52.420
30 more.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.880
Josh, respect.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.380
Jesus.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.800
I don't want to do another 30 seconds.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.360
It's so uncomfortable the first time.

09:06.560 --> 09:07.920
You know what was uncomfortable?

09:07.920 --> 09:10.240
As as a nation, watching those people leap to their deaths.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.560
Can we take 30 fucking seconds, Joe?

09:16.400 --> 09:17.520
A moment of silence.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.160
I don't like that at all.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.480
No, sir.

09:27.920 --> 09:34.560
And with that, I think let's get into this episode of this one shot that we're doing

09:34.560 --> 09:36.400
here with David Winters.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.280
Have you ever heard this? Winters is coming.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.600
That's what he says every time he climaxes.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.440
Episode two.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.720
We feel like we know you.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.480
We're comfortable with you, David.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.600
Are you comfortable?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.000
I'm so comfortable.

09:52.000 --> 09:52.880
You don't even know.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.080
That is actually scary.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.240
All right, let's go into this 18-year-old girl's room.

10:01.200 --> 10:01.700
Mm-hmm.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.640
We just found a business card.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, and we're gonna...

10:10.000 --> 10:10.800
Yes, yes, yes.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.760
We need to go talk to Bradley Allen, he uses his computer.

10:15.760 --> 10:16.880
We've got a lot of people we need to talk to.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.040
Bradley Allen has potentially been at work missing this whole time,

10:21.040 --> 10:25.040
but we do know there's an internet-capable computer at his work, so...

10:26.320 --> 10:29.440
Was the town hall and the sheriff's office all kind of together?

10:29.440 --> 10:31.920
Yep, yep, that's all the center of Grover'sville.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.440
We're gonna kill a lot of birds.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.640
He found a business card, just to recap.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.840
Scott Adams, watch the skies with an email address.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.000
Watch the skies at AOL.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.500
Watch.

10:43.200 --> 10:43.700
Yes.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.280
He's probably still working through his 20 free hours

10:47.280 --> 10:51.360
from his last three and a half inch floppy disk that he just received.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.560
Those were fun in the early 90s.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.760
All the CDs and floppy disks is where they try to get you hooked.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.560
AOL mailers.

10:58.560 --> 11:02.000
You're like, hey, you can get 20 hours of internet a month for $15.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.480
Now, did you look more closely at the business card?

11:06.480 --> 11:08.400
We didn't even get to the business card that much.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.600
Did we put it under blacklight?

11:12.160 --> 11:13.840
Yeah, if you have a black...

11:13.840 --> 11:18.080
Someone has to have a Room Raider style blacklight flashlight

11:18.080 --> 11:19.520
on their character sheet, right?

11:19.520 --> 11:22.000
I think Harlan definitely would.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.000
He was wearing cargo pants.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.040
I think all those pockets were full of things like that.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.340
That was...

11:29.040 --> 11:32.000
We didn't have time to send you the list of things in Harlan's pants,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.160
but I reviewed it beforehand.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.280
That was one of the things.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.640
If you want to check the business card for semen, you can do so.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.240
Yeah, that's standard procedure in my line of work.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.080
This is a pretty sexy business card.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.640
We do need to think like 1992, so we should probably also check for prints.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.960
So we do that because we're cops in 1992.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.600
Rest in peace.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.400
The show?

11:57.520 --> 11:58.020
The show.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.400
Yeah, that was sad.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.680
30 seconds of silence.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.240
What's up, everybody?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.880
Further look at the business card.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.200
Yeah, we are investigating the business card, right?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.640
Yeah, so do you want to use forensics if any of you...

12:16.640 --> 12:18.720
Yeah, I got 50 of that.

12:18.720 --> 12:19.280
Hey, me too.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.120
I ain't got none.

12:21.120 --> 12:21.620
Go for it.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.720
49!

12:24.720 --> 12:26.160
I failed a 61.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.600
Alright, with your forensic skill, you dust for prints,

12:29.600 --> 12:32.400
but that's a weird thing to dust for on a business card.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.080
However, also with your forensic skill, you flip the business card over

12:36.080 --> 12:38.400
and there's also a phone number handwritten on the back.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.680
Good thing you rolled a success.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have seen that.

12:46.240 --> 12:46.960
I'm looking at it.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.280
What are these numbers?

12:51.440 --> 12:56.160
Alright, I swear to God, these make the same amount of digits.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.800
How many is a phone number?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.280
We'll have to call it.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.720
I bet it's Scott Adams.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.000
We'll have to get to a phone.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.440
I bet there's one near the computer at Bradley's office.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.320
Hey, do you think this is famed creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams?

13:13.440 --> 13:16.320
That's the assumption I was operating under.

13:16.320 --> 13:16.960
I bet it is.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.760
Cindy Woodapega looks really serious and goes,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.560
I don't read the newspaper.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.840
And not even the funnies?

13:25.840 --> 13:27.840
Dilbert's a slice of office life comic.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.040
I've got a few of them posted up in my cubicle back at,

13:31.840 --> 13:35.680
you know, our main DAA headquarters in the city that that is located in.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.040
Whatever field office we're currently based out of, which is uh...

13:39.040 --> 13:39.540
Memphis?

13:40.160 --> 13:41.680
Yeah, Memphis.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.360
Back in my cubicle in Memphis.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.800
I'll show you when we get back there.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.000
I look forward to it.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.720
It's pretty funny.

13:46.720 --> 13:47.840
Dogworth flies a plane.

13:47.840 --> 13:57.920
Well, Nancy, I think I know what the answer is going to be,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.600
but are you familiar with the Scott Adams fella?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.400
Yes, but I haven't seen a newspaper and...

14:05.120 --> 14:05.840
Oh, sorry.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.880
Not the Dilbert guy.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.600
No, this.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.440
And I show her the business card.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.120
No, I don't.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.320
I don't know who that is.

14:12.320 --> 14:17.760
Was your daughter into like Dilbert or UFOs or anything like that?

14:17.840 --> 14:23.280
Either of those things.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.680
Yeah, and stuff like it.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.600
A weird Venn diagram of the two.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.520
Yeah, she collected all of the alien themed Dilbert cartoons.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.080
How'd you know?

14:36.880 --> 14:38.880
That just a lucky guess.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.320
That Venn diagram's a circle from November of 87.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.240
I ran for a few weeks.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.560
Dogworth flies a UFO.

14:48.000 --> 14:56.640
No, I have no idea who Scott Adams is, nor do I care.

14:56.640 --> 15:00.880
Nancy, this is kind of a stretch, but did your daughter ever mention,

15:01.920 --> 15:06.400
you know, exploring the theoretical limits of human capability,

15:06.960 --> 15:09.200
perhaps through surgical enhancements?

15:10.720 --> 15:14.800
No, I thought you were going to say through seeking higher education in college,

15:14.880 --> 15:19.200
and she has discussed that, but surgical enhancements less so.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.080
Where did she want to go?

15:22.080 --> 15:31.520
She wanted to go to the Ohio State University because the V sounds so strong.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.480
Prestigious.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.040
I agree.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.600
That is, that's assertive.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.840
Did she already have a major picked out?

15:39.840 --> 15:41.120
I don't think so.

15:41.120 --> 15:41.920
I don't know.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.640
Illustration?

15:42.640 --> 15:47.600
Yeah, cartoon literary critique.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.280
It's all coming together.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.480
Nancy, this is very important.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.960
Did she ever correspond with any famous cartoonists?

15:55.440 --> 16:00.880
She did with Scott Adams, Gary Larson, Gary Larson.

16:00.880 --> 16:01.760
The far side?

16:01.760 --> 16:03.600
Yes, she's a big far side fan.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.400
The rapper?

16:04.400 --> 16:04.960
Who isn't?

16:04.960 --> 16:08.160
Oh no, I mean, I've got just as many far sides as I do Dilberts.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.400
I can't wait to get you back to Memphis.

16:13.280 --> 16:18.400
I can't wait to get you back to Memphis is an awesome name for a country album.

16:18.400 --> 16:18.880
Yep.

16:18.880 --> 16:19.520
Holy shit.

16:20.880 --> 16:26.480
Well, do you guys, can you think of anything else or should we try to get on the internet?

16:26.480 --> 16:29.840
I wish you the best of luck trying to find this internet you're looking for.

16:30.720 --> 16:36.800
Yeah, I would say you're pretty suspicious to me, but I can't really put my finger on it.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.520
That doesn't mean you're considered a suspect at this time.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.800
Person of interest.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.680
Perhaps.

16:41.680 --> 16:42.160
Okay.

16:42.160 --> 16:46.000
We like letting people know being very transparent.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.600
But a human role on her.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.600
Tell me if she's under the influence of anything.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.640
Can I do that?

16:50.640 --> 16:51.440
That's good.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.680
You can roll medicine or human.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.200
Uh, I'm going to human.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.080
Cause no one has medicine.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.840
I critical fail 88.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.480
Oh, you just yell.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.520
She's on drugs.

17:06.160 --> 17:13.680
She looks as though with your critical fail that she might be very high on PCP right now.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.280
Does his critical fail preclude me from trying to human role?

17:20.160 --> 17:20.960
You can go for it.

17:21.520 --> 17:28.960
The side effects of PCP at higher doses include hallucinations, catatonic posturing,

17:28.960 --> 17:32.640
increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, raised temperature, and shallow breathing

17:32.640 --> 17:36.080
of which is demonstrating all of them with your critical failure.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.360
How do you know David Winters?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.840
This is part of my prep.

17:41.840 --> 17:44.720
I have to, I have to have a random.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.360
Sorry, honey.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.040
I have to live and breathe these characters.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.680
Micro doses, PCP.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.560
I'm like whispering to one of them.

17:55.920 --> 18:00.400
She's, she's sweating and she's got the elevated heart rate and her shallow breathing.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.120
You'd see it, right?

18:01.120 --> 18:02.800
You see all those signs, right?

18:03.360 --> 18:09.920
Yeah, we're, it is classic signs of PCP, but, uh, there does seem to just be something

18:09.920 --> 18:11.120
strange in her eyes.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.720
Uh, something that's not there.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.080
Why don't I take a crack at this?

18:14.640 --> 18:17.600
I rolled a, uh, a 38 on a 60.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.840
She does not look to be under the influence of PCP.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.200
Contrary.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.400
This is classic PCP.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.080
It's not.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I agree with Harlan.

18:28.000 --> 18:38.320
Wait, you look, bear in mind, you do have, you do have two DEA agents and you have tattoos

18:38.320 --> 18:40.400
of PCP on your arm.

18:40.400 --> 18:46.480
I have so many PCP tattoos that show what PCP looks like.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.920
Do you have any ICP tattoos?

18:47.920 --> 18:53.520
Well, you have the cartoon of Dogbert doing PCP and demonstrating all the effects.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.800
Yes, of course.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.360
Well, my juggalo name is tattooed on the back of my neck.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.320
Crystal.

18:58.320 --> 18:58.820
Crystal.

18:59.520 --> 19:04.880
So I wanted to roll a natural and I rolled a 91 because I was trying to see if there's

19:04.880 --> 19:09.040
anything in her eyes that looked unnatural as I'm trying to make my determinations,

19:09.040 --> 19:10.240
but I failed miserably.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.200
Do you have any unnatural?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.240
I have 10 unnatural.

19:12.240 --> 19:19.760
I took it to explain my backstory, uh, which, oh, I'll get to it.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.280
If you don't die first.

19:24.320 --> 19:24.820
Fair enough.

19:25.780 --> 19:28.740
We've seen her far in the future shitting on a toilet with her smartphone.

19:30.340 --> 19:31.700
It was a 90 year old woman.

19:31.700 --> 19:36.020
I've got no problem killing this person in the universe forking in two directions.

19:37.540 --> 19:38.740
So you're on notice sec.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.060
He's not invincible.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.060
Damn it.

19:43.060 --> 19:43.540
Okay.

19:43.540 --> 19:45.060
I don't think she's on.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.860
I can't tell that she, do you think she's on drugs?

19:47.860 --> 19:49.460
No, I don't think she's on drugs.

19:50.340 --> 19:50.980
Yeah.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.620
I think she's just really fucking weird.

19:53.620 --> 19:53.860
Yeah.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.780
I don't really like being around her.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.380
It makes me very uncomfortable.

19:57.380 --> 20:00.660
I did kind of want to have this whole conversation like away from her.

20:00.660 --> 20:03.540
We're all just staring her in the eyes while we're talking,

20:03.540 --> 20:05.380
but honestly she's probably fine with it.

20:05.380 --> 20:05.540
Yeah.

20:05.540 --> 20:10.500
She's just watching you just like something's clearly wrong, but I don't think it's drugs,

20:10.500 --> 20:10.820
ma'am.

20:10.820 --> 20:18.500
Um, have you come under any four episodes of us just questioning this?

20:20.500 --> 20:23.140
You guys are, you're down with Intel, right?

20:24.020 --> 20:26.820
Absolutely.

20:27.540 --> 20:28.020
Okay.

20:28.020 --> 20:31.220
Um, ma'am, have you come under the influence of anything?

20:32.260 --> 20:34.820
He kind of loves his voice and gets like a little closer.

20:36.260 --> 20:36.740
Spooky.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.140
Don't do me now.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.260
Spooky.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.820
Is the X-Files out yet?

20:44.820 --> 20:49.380
Like dragons, aliens, Allens.

20:51.220 --> 20:52.180
Oh, you know what?

20:52.180 --> 20:53.140
I've been in about a year.

20:53.140 --> 20:57.140
There's a show like an exactly this, this time next year.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.660
You're going to be like, wowie zowie.

21:00.660 --> 21:00.900
Wow.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.780
I can really relate to what those guys were going through.

21:03.780 --> 21:05.300
They should have called it the end files.

21:08.180 --> 21:11.700
Anyway, I saw that in my partner's eyes one time.

21:11.700 --> 21:12.340
That's how I know.

21:15.620 --> 21:17.540
We sound crazier than she does.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.980
So we need to get the fuck out.

21:18.980 --> 21:19.940
Let's go talk to Bradley.

21:19.940 --> 21:20.420
Time to leave.

21:21.140 --> 21:21.620
Look at that.

21:21.700 --> 21:22.500
Take care.

21:22.500 --> 21:22.820
Cool.

21:22.820 --> 21:22.980
Yeah.

21:22.980 --> 21:27.220
Can we do like a little quick search of the rest of the house as we go out?

21:27.220 --> 21:27.720
Sure.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.340
Like just to search.

21:30.340 --> 21:32.100
I rolled a 16 on a 70.

21:34.180 --> 21:34.980
Pass.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.180
48 on a 50.

21:36.180 --> 21:36.900
I failed.

21:36.900 --> 21:37.540
I failed too.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.740
A 79 on a 70.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.020
I rolled a 79.

21:40.660 --> 21:44.260
They tumbled down the stairs, but we noticed behind a picture frame.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.200
Yeah.

21:48.100 --> 21:48.600
Oh shit.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.380
Boy, well, no critical successes.

21:56.100 --> 21:56.980
That's what I was.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.100
I was looking for there.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.580
Otherwise you would have found, uh, several bodies.

22:02.740 --> 22:04.260
I just didn't look that direction.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.620
You would have found a little alien mind controlling her behind the walls.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.620
There's nothing out of place or out of the ordinary.

22:11.620 --> 22:12.740
The house is pristine.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.700
You see clearly her husband lives there as well.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.340
Much like the daughter, their rooms are spotless.

22:18.340 --> 22:23.540
It seems as though this lady just walks around the house, cleans all day and thinks about

22:23.540 --> 22:24.820
Dilbert cartoons.

22:24.820 --> 22:25.940
And that's pretty much it.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.820
In a lot of ways, Joe Dane can relate to that.

22:30.340 --> 22:30.580
Wow.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.100
That's really sad, man.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.140
He's a by the book guy.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.060
Let's head down to this city center.

22:37.060 --> 22:37.620
City hall.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.140
We're doing a city hall.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.180
Do we want to do?

22:40.180 --> 22:41.380
It's about 10 o'clock now.

22:41.380 --> 22:42.740
We spent two hours there.

22:43.700 --> 22:47.140
You spent two hours, both in story and in real life.

22:47.140 --> 22:47.700
Questioning.

22:51.780 --> 22:52.820
I want to be very clear.

22:52.820 --> 22:57.700
You can never spend less in game time than you spend in real life doing something.

23:00.340 --> 23:04.980
According to her, her husband's still there, so we might as well stop by.

23:04.980 --> 23:06.020
According to her.

23:06.660 --> 23:08.660
And she seems super trustworthy.

23:10.180 --> 23:15.060
Let's go see the sheriff first and we can talk about, we can ascertain what the local

23:15.060 --> 23:20.260
fuzz knows and maybe get kind of a more bird's eye view of the town from him.

23:20.260 --> 23:20.900
I agree with that.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.180
We don't need to let him know that we need to use the internet to look this shit up.

23:24.180 --> 23:25.140
To the sheriff.

23:25.140 --> 23:27.860
You drive about the one mile back into town.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.620
Again, center of town is the town hall.

23:29.620 --> 23:36.260
Just to the side is the joint sheriff's office, ambulance, single ambulance stand and volunteer

23:36.260 --> 23:37.300
fire department.

23:37.300 --> 23:43.140
You knock on the door and conveniently the sheriff, even though it's 10 o'clock at night,

23:43.140 --> 23:44.660
is still working.

23:44.660 --> 23:46.020
And he greets you.

23:46.740 --> 23:48.580
Ah, you agents.

23:48.580 --> 23:50.100
Thank you for finally making it.

23:50.980 --> 23:51.940
Sheriff Dan Oakley.

23:52.900 --> 23:53.940
How goes it?

23:53.940 --> 23:55.860
Oakley, it's nice to make your acquaintance.

23:55.860 --> 23:57.300
And she puts out a hand.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.140
Is she taller than him too?

23:59.140 --> 24:00.260
No, he's pretty tall.

24:00.260 --> 24:06.020
He's tall, but fat with gray hair, solid gray mustache hugging his upper lip.

24:06.020 --> 24:09.460
He looks kind of like a poor man's cliff from Cheers.

24:09.460 --> 24:16.740
As he goes to meet her for a, for a hand shake, she like dodges it and then goes for

24:16.740 --> 24:21.860
a hug where she puts her arms around his, like right above his belt.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.100
Whoa, whoa there, miss.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.620
Hey, careful.

24:26.980 --> 24:27.780
Good to meet you.

24:27.780 --> 24:29.220
Close to my gun, if you know what I mean.

24:30.340 --> 24:31.540
Close to your woodpecker.

24:31.540 --> 24:32.820
I'm Cindy Woodpecker.

24:34.820 --> 24:35.540
Nice to meet you.

24:36.180 --> 24:37.220
Sheriff Dan Oakley.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.140
I've got to apologize for my partner.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.100
I'm agent Dodine and this is my partner.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.740
Agent Cindy Woodpecker, DEA.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.940
These are our associates on this current task force.

24:47.940 --> 24:48.820
Harlin.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.620
Hello.

24:49.620 --> 24:50.660
Tan Luthad.

24:50.660 --> 24:51.300
Hello Tan.

24:51.860 --> 24:52.660
Nice to meet you all.

24:53.220 --> 24:55.620
Sounds like you've got a real pickle here in town.

24:55.620 --> 24:55.780
Yeah.

24:55.780 --> 24:58.500
Why don't you brief us on what you know so far, Sheriff?

24:58.500 --> 25:03.060
And she lets go of the embrace or just life in general.

25:04.340 --> 25:05.220
I don't want to be around.

25:05.220 --> 25:06.180
Which would you prefer?

25:07.540 --> 25:08.100
Let it go.

25:08.900 --> 25:12.420
No, as she lets go of the Sheriff, you see that, like,

25:12.420 --> 25:15.700
Jodine has had a very intense grasp on like her belt,

25:15.700 --> 25:18.180
like trying to like pull her away this whole time.

25:19.380 --> 25:22.420
Like a dog straight on the leash, pulling her back.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.060
Yes.

25:23.060 --> 25:25.700
Okay, so you successfully pull her back and he's,

25:27.220 --> 25:29.060
I'm glad you made it in here.

25:29.780 --> 25:31.220
Welcome to my town.

25:31.220 --> 25:35.460
Been Sheriff here for years and it's not too often we get

25:35.700 --> 25:38.340
city folk in here.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.380
What do you want to know?

25:39.380 --> 25:40.580
What can I help you with?

25:40.580 --> 25:42.820
Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?

25:43.540 --> 25:44.660
Sunny days.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.380
Ah, nice.

25:45.380 --> 25:46.020
Okay, sick.

25:46.020 --> 25:47.700
So you're a Grover's fan too.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.180
All right, so we just got in.

25:50.180 --> 25:54.340
We went to the Allen's house and that mother is under some

25:54.340 --> 25:55.220
sort of influence.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.820
Doesn't seem to be drugs from my personal understanding of

25:58.820 --> 26:01.060
the situation, but she is out of it for real.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.180
And she has not seen her daughter who was the boyfriend in

26:04.180 --> 26:04.660
forever.

26:05.220 --> 26:06.900
The daughter was the boyfriend?

26:06.900 --> 26:07.860
Yeah, three weeks.

26:08.420 --> 26:08.660
Yeah.

26:08.660 --> 26:13.220
So has there been a, would you say, a rash of disappearances

26:13.220 --> 26:13.780
in this town?

26:14.420 --> 26:15.300
Not that I'm aware of.

26:16.420 --> 26:17.620
Is that what you're investigating?

26:17.620 --> 26:20.900
No, no, we're here investigating a super myth.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.940
Yeah, a rare strain of super myth with the DEA.

26:23.940 --> 26:27.380
But Sheriff, let me ask you one question real quick that

26:27.380 --> 26:28.900
might cut to the quick here.

26:30.340 --> 26:33.140
Has anything been going wrong in your town lately or do you

26:33.220 --> 26:34.500
feel like things are just fine?

26:34.500 --> 26:39.620
Are you insulting my ability to police this town?

26:39.620 --> 26:40.100
No, sir.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.180
That's a standard DEA question.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.180
It's just something we have to ask.

26:44.180 --> 26:45.140
It's part of a forum.

26:45.140 --> 26:48.260
When drugs are involved, oftentimes things go a little haywire.

26:48.260 --> 26:51.140
We just wanted to see if there's no drugs.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.500
There are no drugs here.

26:52.500 --> 26:53.780
Let's just put it that way.

26:53.780 --> 26:57.380
I feel like I've kind of given a sort of presence to where

26:57.380 --> 26:59.700
he's going to ignore me, which is what I was going for.

26:59.700 --> 27:04.420
I'd like to be looking for cuts, small incisions on his skin

27:05.220 --> 27:08.020
while he is caught off guard by being offended.

27:08.020 --> 27:08.740
Give me a search.

27:09.620 --> 27:10.340
22.

27:13.140 --> 27:14.020
Hell yes.

27:14.020 --> 27:17.220
You get a good enough look because remember it required

27:17.220 --> 27:19.780
that last time to see those tiny little pricks.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.420
He does not have them.

27:24.660 --> 27:27.140
He would have had to have found a way to manage the pain.

27:27.540 --> 27:33.300
Sheriff, were you aware that Jane Allen has been missing?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.860
No, I wasn't.

27:35.860 --> 27:39.140
Have any other kids gone missing that you're aware of?

27:39.140 --> 27:41.140
Well, that Billy Ray boy, of course.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.500
But you know all about that.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.860
Yeah, that's kind of what sent us down here.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.620
The super meth that he was on.

27:47.620 --> 27:48.340
Yeah.

27:48.340 --> 27:51.620
Which is how come he was able to punch his daddy through the chest so hard.

27:51.620 --> 27:54.340
Yeah, it's real shame.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.620
Yeah, real shame.

27:55.620 --> 27:56.340
And the devil.

27:57.060 --> 27:58.420
You know, them kids.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.060
The combination of the two is really horrible.

28:01.060 --> 28:01.780
DND.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.700
It gets them all riled up.

28:03.700 --> 28:04.500
Always at work.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.860
Yeah, kids need church.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.140
Spiritual war is real.

28:09.940 --> 28:10.340
It is.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.580
It seems you have two churches here, which seems a little light for a town of 1200.

28:15.700 --> 28:18.100
Do you have problems with attendance?

28:18.100 --> 28:20.340
What percentage of your population would you say attends?

28:20.340 --> 28:21.140
It's a light flock.

28:21.140 --> 28:22.420
Let's put it that way.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.740
We used to have three churches.

28:24.740 --> 28:25.300
Shame.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.260
One went out of business.

28:27.780 --> 28:29.060
Yeah, it's happening all over.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.740
To the extent churches are businesses.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.380
Of course, everything should be run like a business.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.500
And it's America.

28:34.500 --> 28:34.820
Yeah.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.340
Are you looking to attend services?

28:36.340 --> 28:38.500
Is that why you're asking these very specific church questions?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.020
Maybe if we're in town long enough.

28:40.020 --> 28:44.100
The next question I actually want to know is, have you seen Bradley Allen recently?

28:44.980 --> 28:45.460
The Alder?

28:45.460 --> 28:47.540
Yeah, he's next door.

28:47.540 --> 28:48.980
Yeah, he works next door.

28:48.980 --> 28:53.220
Have you seen him coming and going from work in the past few days or even weeks?

28:53.860 --> 28:55.060
Yeah, here and there.

28:55.060 --> 28:57.140
When was the last couple days ago?

28:57.140 --> 28:57.860
What's he like?

28:57.860 --> 28:59.460
What can you tell us about him?

28:59.460 --> 29:00.100
Smart man.

29:00.820 --> 29:04.500
He was educated in the big city.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.740
We're lucky to have him as a leader.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.180
Is he from around here?

29:08.180 --> 29:08.980
Born and bred.

29:17.220 --> 29:18.420
Let's go to the bakery.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.700
We're getting to the butt end of this.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.980
If I could be of any service to you all, I'd be happy to.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.860
But I think this drug stuff is nonsense.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.700
It would never happen under my watch.

29:29.700 --> 29:33.700
Sheriff, you never know with folks not attending church like they once did.

29:33.700 --> 29:38.340
I've seen good, upstanding Christian children just go astray.

29:38.340 --> 29:42.740
And so you told me your flock was diminishing and we're with the DEA.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.140
It gets, you wouldn't believe what we see.

29:45.780 --> 29:46.980
Super meth for one.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.740
But we're basically healers.

29:48.740 --> 29:49.940
You have nothing to worry about.

29:49.940 --> 29:52.500
We're going to come in and we're going to take care of it.

29:52.580 --> 29:55.780
And you're going to look like a hero and it'll be great.

29:55.780 --> 29:57.060
I want to know one thing.

29:57.060 --> 30:01.460
And that is you're here investigating the super meth.

30:01.460 --> 30:03.460
Why are you looking for missing people?

30:03.460 --> 30:06.740
The, the boy, uh, Billy Ray Spivvy.

30:06.740 --> 30:07.540
Spivvy?

30:07.540 --> 30:08.980
How do folks say that around here?

30:08.980 --> 30:09.780
Spivvy.

30:09.780 --> 30:10.820
Spivvy.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.420
Those spivvy spivvies.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.140
And the spivvy spivvies.

30:15.140 --> 30:17.620
You said that with perhaps a hint of disdain.

30:17.620 --> 30:20.740
Is that a family that's, that causes some, some ruckus?

30:20.740 --> 30:21.380
Occasionally.

30:22.100 --> 30:23.060
Occasionally.

30:23.060 --> 30:26.820
They've been known to get in trouble with the law.

30:26.820 --> 30:30.420
Well, then I doubt you'd be surprised to hear that we suspect that's baby boy brought the

30:30.420 --> 30:34.500
super meth to your town and he might've spread it around to some of his friends.

30:34.500 --> 30:39.780
And with the drugs, a lot of the times, you know, people don't pay their, what they owe

30:39.780 --> 30:40.980
and people go missing.

30:40.980 --> 30:45.540
And so that's kind of the connection of, you know, every thread we can kind of pull on.

30:45.540 --> 30:48.260
So we were just looking for his girlfriend then that Jane Allen.

30:48.900 --> 30:54.740
And we dropped by her mama's house who said that she ain't seen her in about three weeks.

30:54.740 --> 30:57.460
So that got us, that was just got us wondering.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.220
I'm, I'm sure she's going to be fine.

30:59.220 --> 31:04.980
I wouldn't, I'll fill out a report, but kids around here, very mature.

31:04.980 --> 31:10.500
Speaking of the kids around here, I was curious if you, if you knew about the local hangouts,

31:10.500 --> 31:14.580
where, where do they, where do those kids congregate, especially the seniors in town?

31:14.580 --> 31:19.700
Well, the kids that can drink, they, they go to Murrells County bunker.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.220
It's the only place in town with, with booze license.

31:23.220 --> 31:24.500
We keep all the riffraff there.

31:25.220 --> 31:27.780
The younger ones, I know what those kids do.

31:28.340 --> 31:31.780
They have their siblings buy them beer at the county bunker.

31:31.780 --> 31:35.060
And then they take it down to the reservoir and hang at the reservoir.

31:35.780 --> 31:39.700
And how, how, how big a gathering do you sometimes find there at the reservoir?

31:39.700 --> 31:43.700
Is it, is it five or six kids or is it 20 or 30 kids?

31:43.700 --> 31:44.740
Ah, just a handful.

31:44.740 --> 31:46.260
Small town, small town.

31:46.260 --> 31:47.380
What day is today?

31:47.380 --> 31:48.740
Yeah, is it party time?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.820
It's a, it is a Thursday night.

31:50.820 --> 31:51.780
Thirsty Thursday.

31:51.780 --> 31:52.420
Thirsty Thursday.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.220
I bet the kids are down at the reservoir.

31:59.220 --> 32:03.060
Maybe we go down there and talk to them after we talk to Mr. Allen.

32:03.620 --> 32:04.660
If he's, yeah.

32:04.660 --> 32:05.700
If he's in there.

32:05.700 --> 32:08.500
How many aldermen does this town have besides Mr. Allen?

32:08.500 --> 32:08.820
Eight.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.340
Name all of them.

32:10.980 --> 32:15.540
Oh, super good.

32:15.540 --> 32:16.580
I'd really rather not.

32:18.180 --> 32:20.740
I'll tell you the head aldermen is Merle barn.

32:20.740 --> 32:21.540
Oh, that makes sense.

32:22.260 --> 32:22.500
Yeah.

32:22.500 --> 32:23.940
Richest man in town.

32:23.940 --> 32:26.260
Is he the booze owner and the hotel we're staying at?

32:26.260 --> 32:26.820
Yes, sir.

32:26.820 --> 32:27.540
Oh yeah.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.860
And the hotel and the auto body shop.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.100
Who owns the ice cream parlor?

32:32.100 --> 32:33.620
Oh, that's not Merle.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.220
It's competing business of his.

32:36.100 --> 32:36.980
The mega deuce.

32:37.700 --> 32:44.100
I would recommend if, uh, you, you recognize it is almost midnight and you have not had

32:44.100 --> 32:46.420
anything to eat nor are you sleeping.

32:46.420 --> 32:49.700
Where can we get a bite to eat at midnight around here?

32:49.700 --> 32:56.980
Only if the mega deuce in a town like this, uh, everything shuts down at about nine o'clock

32:56.980 --> 32:59.780
except the 24 seven mega deuce.

32:59.780 --> 33:00.820
That's very handy.

33:00.820 --> 33:06.420
That doesn't seem like a great business idea, but I'm glad they're open.

33:07.220 --> 33:08.500
Should we go talk to Bradley?

33:11.060 --> 33:16.260
Well, I mean, so sheriff is the city hall open right now.

33:16.260 --> 33:17.380
Would anybody be there?

33:17.940 --> 33:18.440
Probably.

33:19.060 --> 33:19.540
Yeah.

33:19.540 --> 33:19.780
Yeah.

33:19.780 --> 33:20.740
Let's go check it out.

33:20.740 --> 33:21.540
Yeah, let's go.

33:21.540 --> 33:26.900
She opens up her purse and pulls out a few cliff bars and hands them out to the group.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.180
Chomp these, uh, grainy boys down on the way there.

33:30.900 --> 33:31.540
Give me some.

33:31.540 --> 33:32.980
No, you don't want one?

33:33.540 --> 33:34.420
And they don't exist.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.300
Cliff bars exist.

33:35.940 --> 33:38.900
Oh, she pulls out four bags of trail mix.

33:40.340 --> 33:42.100
Oh, her home at her trail mix is good.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.460
There's lots of M and M's.

33:43.460 --> 33:47.940
What's the brand of those really, really dry nature valley nature valley.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.500
Yeah.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.940
I think those are boosted at the time.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.180
Those were definitely around by the mid nineties.

33:52.180 --> 33:54.580
Man, those things make a mess, huh?

33:54.580 --> 33:55.780
Yeah, they're good though.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.780
They are really tasty before we leave.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.180
Harlan wants to ask the Sheriff.

34:00.180 --> 34:04.980
Uh, Sheriff, are you, uh, are you aware of, uh, of a Scott Adams in town?

34:06.340 --> 34:08.740
Scott at yes.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.580
That troublemaker.

34:10.580 --> 34:10.900
Yes.

34:10.900 --> 34:14.260
I looking at a UFO nonsense.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.460
One of those idiots.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.860
What does he have to do with the drugs?

34:17.860 --> 34:18.420
Oh, nothing.

34:18.420 --> 34:20.820
We were just wondering if he was the fellow who wrote Dilbert.

34:20.820 --> 34:21.300
Same name.

34:22.340 --> 34:23.140
I checked.

34:23.140 --> 34:24.660
Would you run a background check on him?

34:25.300 --> 34:25.780
Not him.

34:26.740 --> 34:28.020
That is disappointing.

34:28.020 --> 34:32.020
On average, how many UFO abductions do you have around here?

34:32.020 --> 34:32.820
We're just fans.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.980
Wait, we don't have any.

34:36.980 --> 34:38.100
That is nonsense.

34:38.740 --> 34:39.780
Bunch of poppycock.

34:39.780 --> 34:42.820
If you ask me, I just it's, it's ATF procedure.

34:42.820 --> 34:46.580
You got to ask, have you been your, your whole life Sheriff?

34:46.580 --> 34:47.220
Born and bred.

34:48.180 --> 34:49.060
He said it again.

34:49.700 --> 34:55.540
What, what to the best of your knowledge is the, the origin of these UFO conspiracies

34:55.540 --> 34:56.900
surrounding this town.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.780
Why are you asking so many questions about UFOs?

35:00.900 --> 35:03.220
Wait, is that David or the Sheriff?

35:03.220 --> 35:05.060
Uh, why are you asking?

35:09.940 --> 35:11.620
I was like, you're gaslighting us.

35:11.620 --> 35:17.620
If the spooky Delta green story about a UFO town doesn't like anyway.

35:17.620 --> 35:17.860
Okay.

35:18.740 --> 35:24.660
Well, no, it's just that, uh, well, we heard that was kind of, uh, you know, what passes

35:24.660 --> 35:27.540
for tourist draw around here was kind of the UFO.

35:27.540 --> 35:27.700
Yeah.

35:27.700 --> 35:31.460
We like to get to know the history, even the alternative false histories.

35:31.460 --> 35:32.900
We need to know the character of the town.

35:32.900 --> 35:33.540
Sure.

35:33.540 --> 35:34.260
Sure.

35:34.260 --> 35:34.760
Yes.

35:35.620 --> 35:36.100
Fine.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.380
Uh, yes, we are the butt end of jokes all across the country.

35:40.100 --> 35:44.420
They say those idiots in Grover's Ville, they say they're such Muppets.

35:44.420 --> 35:45.620
They named a Muppet after him.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.820
That's what they say about us.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.140
I'm from Ralphsburg.

35:49.140 --> 35:50.340
So I understand.

35:50.340 --> 35:50.980
Oh, sorry.

35:50.980 --> 35:51.620
Rolfsburg.

35:51.620 --> 35:54.500
Yeah.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.620
I'm sorry to hear that.

35:55.620 --> 35:56.900
I'm from Elmo town.

35:56.900 --> 36:01.620
So I also completely I'm from big birding 10 say one, Joe.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.820
Uh, snuffle up against, uh, that's, uh, that's one of them.

36:04.820 --> 36:05.460
Snuffle up.

36:08.980 --> 36:10.740
What we're saying is we know your pain.

36:10.740 --> 36:11.140
Yeah.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.340
We don't think this is a mother.

36:12.340 --> 36:13.140
Thank you.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.860
Sounds like you got your head on straight about all this, but why?

36:15.860 --> 36:16.660
What again?

36:16.660 --> 36:17.460
Yes, sir.

36:17.460 --> 36:18.340
What's the origin?

36:18.340 --> 36:19.060
Why did it start?

36:19.140 --> 36:23.540
Was there like a Roswell crash siding sort of precipitating incident or

36:24.260 --> 36:29.300
people say they see stuff in the skies and that kind of nonsense.

36:29.940 --> 36:31.300
Never seen it myself.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.420
Think it's a bunch of hooey.

36:32.980 --> 36:33.940
This town's fine.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.940
I am a great sheriff to be clear.

36:37.940 --> 36:38.900
I believe that.

36:38.900 --> 36:39.540
I believe that.

36:39.540 --> 36:40.020
Sheriff.

36:40.020 --> 36:40.500
Yeah.

36:40.500 --> 36:40.900
You know what?

36:40.900 --> 36:43.620
Here's our car phone number and he scribbles it down.

36:43.620 --> 36:44.500
You just call us.

36:45.140 --> 36:45.640
Yeah.

36:46.260 --> 36:46.760
Yeah.

36:47.320 --> 36:47.820
Wow.

36:49.160 --> 36:53.400
So you just call us anytime you got some pertinent information.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.400
You might think of anything you think of.

36:55.400 --> 36:56.680
You can call the DAA.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.000
Sorry.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.080
I just, I want to be clear here.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.160
It's a phone in your car.

37:01.160 --> 37:01.660
Yeah.

37:02.360 --> 37:02.520
Yeah.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.120
I think they've had those for about 10 years.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.240
Isn't that cool?

37:05.240 --> 37:06.840
That's so cool, right?

37:06.840 --> 37:08.600
You can, uh, beat me too.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.920
I got my beeper, my pager on me.

37:10.920 --> 37:15.880
I'll beep you something funny sometime like eight zero zero eight.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.360
Oh, boobs.

37:18.360 --> 37:18.600
Yeah.

37:18.600 --> 37:18.920
Sheriff.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.680
Let's do try to keep things professional.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.360
We are federal agents.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.400
I'm sorry.

37:23.400 --> 37:27.480
That man's beeper channel is a critical piece of national security.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.720
Can't be filling it up with security with boobs.

37:29.720 --> 37:34.680
Beeper number is, uh, actually, yeah, it's eight zero zero eight one three five.

37:36.360 --> 37:41.560
Wooda Baker goes for the high five and then turns her back and starts walking next door.

37:43.160 --> 37:43.320
Yeah.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.360
We're done with you, Sheriff.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.360
Wait, Joe's always got one more question.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.920
Wait, let's go to the last question with Joe.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.840
You're, uh, you're working here pretty late.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.600
Is there something that's keeping you tonight?

37:59.320 --> 37:59.640
Sorry.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.360
Is it, uh, since when is it bad to love your job?

38:02.920 --> 38:03.880
I'm not saying it's bad.

38:03.880 --> 38:07.240
I'm asking if there's something on your desk that's taking a little extra time.

38:07.240 --> 38:11.000
If loving your job is wrong, then I don't want to be right.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.200
You know, exactly.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.480
We believe that too.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.000
But, uh, what are you working on tonight?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.200
What's your job tonight?

38:16.200 --> 38:19.160
Just general policing, waiting for calls to come in.

38:19.160 --> 38:19.880
I have a staff.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.360
I have a staff of 28 deputies.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.200
Is there that much crime around here?

38:24.200 --> 38:27.480
That's a lot of it's the whole, it's the county, the whole county.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.760
No, they're severely understaffed.

38:36.840 --> 38:41.240
Yes, I, I have, uh, 28 deputies for a 1200 person town.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.760
We're very over policed.

38:45.000 --> 38:45.960
That sounds about right.

38:46.760 --> 38:52.200
Have all your deputies, have all your deputies been coming in and showing up to work and

38:52.200 --> 38:53.080
everything?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.840
I would stand for nothing less.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.480
Okay.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.360
Just making sure.

38:57.880 --> 38:58.440
Bye.

38:58.440 --> 38:58.760
Bye.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.440
I don't trust you.

39:00.440 --> 39:01.160
All right, let's go.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.000
She don't trust nobody though.

39:03.000 --> 39:03.880
That's just her way.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.480
Hey, you have a pleasant Eden Sheriff.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.200
Thank you Sheriff.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.000
Thank you.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.480
I love making Thomas play the character that cleans up my social messes.

39:11.480 --> 39:19.400
As you leave, he calls out, uh, if you, if you go to the mega deuce, tell him the Sheriff

39:19.400 --> 39:20.040
sent you.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.080
Oh yeah, we'll do.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.040
Wait, hold on now.

39:24.040 --> 39:24.840
One more question.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.320
You reeled him back in.

39:30.280 --> 39:35.800
Now, now Murlsey, he, he owns the competing businesses to the, to the mega deuce.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.000
Yeah.

39:37.000 --> 39:37.880
Yes sir.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.240
Why didn't you tell us to say the Sheriff sent you to Murl's?

39:41.640 --> 39:45.880
Agent, have you ever heard of supporting small and local?

39:46.600 --> 39:48.440
Just trying to help Mr. Cervantes out.

39:48.440 --> 39:49.400
Can I, he meant that?

39:49.400 --> 39:49.900
Sure.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.360
59 on a 60.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.040
Oh, he's not really bullshitting you.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.720
It doesn't seem like he's misleading you.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.600
He's suggesting you go to like a 24 hour diner and restaurant versus going to a bar with

40:02.600 --> 40:06.200
presumably like microwave chicken fingers and stuff.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.160
It's actually probably just good advice as far as quality food goes.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.640
He's being nice.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.520
This devious bastard.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.560
Wait a minute.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.640
Harlan, I've looked into his soul.

40:21.560 --> 40:25.640
I've seen a kind man offering true culinary suggestions.

40:25.640 --> 40:29.160
So I believe we should head on a, well, wait, I guess we're going to hit up the city hall

40:29.160 --> 40:29.660
first.

40:30.360 --> 40:30.860
Bye.

40:30.860 --> 40:31.360
Bye.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.360
Bye.

40:32.360 --> 40:32.860
Bye.

40:32.860 --> 40:33.360
Bye.

40:33.360 --> 40:33.860
Bye.

40:33.860 --> 40:34.360
Bye.

40:34.360 --> 40:34.860
Bye.

40:34.860 --> 40:37.000
Walking sounds, walking sounds, walking sounds.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.800
You walk a whole 30 feet to like the front of city hall.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.840
We ring the doorbell.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.600
We're playing like a side scroller.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.560
Three thugs attack you.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.200
All in a line.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.800
I move my joystick to the right.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.120
So you go to the city hall.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.880
It's a nicer, more regal looking building.

41:01.880 --> 41:04.440
Clearly the nicest building in town.

41:04.440 --> 41:08.360
It's up almost a flight of stairs outside to get kind of in the front.

41:08.360 --> 41:14.280
And there's like a large grand foyer as you get in with a reception desk up front.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.160
And it happens to be staffed by a young woman right now.

41:17.160 --> 41:21.720
How long is the loading screen from when we go inside to when we can see everything?

41:21.720 --> 41:25.640
Well, it's the early nineties, so it's probably around eight or nine minutes.

41:27.000 --> 41:27.800
But that's good.

41:27.800 --> 41:29.960
And you probably had to switch discs in between.

41:29.960 --> 41:30.460
Right.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.160
Is the young woman Jane Allen?

41:34.440 --> 41:36.200
No.

41:36.200 --> 41:37.000
Hey, could it be?

41:37.000 --> 41:37.960
That would be convenient.

41:37.960 --> 41:38.440
Could it be?

41:40.600 --> 41:41.320
She was at work.

41:41.320 --> 41:41.880
Hot damn.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.000
Cracked the cakes.

41:43.000 --> 41:43.880
Her mom was right.

41:45.560 --> 41:49.240
Her husband and daughter were just working a lot for a really long time.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.000
Hi ma'am.

41:51.000 --> 41:51.560
Hello.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.520
We're agents.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.520
Could you point us to Mr. Bradley Allen's office?

41:56.520 --> 41:57.480
Ah, the alderman.

41:58.040 --> 41:58.680
Yes.

41:58.680 --> 41:59.320
That's the one.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.640
Let me get him for you.

42:01.640 --> 42:02.600
He's in his office?

42:02.600 --> 42:04.280
Yeah, he's busy right now.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.720
I'll get him for you if you can just hang here.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.840
Can I interest?

42:08.840 --> 42:11.320
Real quick, we want to go back and ask the sheriff some questions.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.200
We do?

42:14.200 --> 42:15.480
No, I'm sorry.

42:17.080 --> 42:20.200
Real quick, how many of the aldermen are working tonight?

42:20.200 --> 42:22.120
Just a couple of them, I think.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.240
Is it typical for them to, you know, burn that old midnight oil?

42:25.240 --> 42:26.120
It's tax season.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.480
You know, alderman and taxes.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.200
You know, that's what they say, like peas and carrots.

42:32.200 --> 42:32.760
And death.

42:33.400 --> 42:33.720
And death.

42:33.720 --> 42:34.520
Death and aldermen.

42:35.400 --> 42:36.520
That's what they say.

42:36.520 --> 42:36.840
Go ahead.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.800
I'll go get him.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.560
We'll guard the desk for you while you go get him.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.280
Thank you.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.680
And sorry, you said you wanted to speak to Bradley, right?

42:44.680 --> 42:45.080
Yes.

42:45.080 --> 42:45.800
Yes ma'am.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.400
How many did she say were working?

42:47.400 --> 42:47.880
Two.

42:47.880 --> 42:48.200
Wow.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.120
Do you want a glass of water or anything while you're waiting?

42:50.120 --> 42:52.200
Just go get the alderman, please.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.960
All right, there's a water cooler over there.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.880
If you need anything, the bathroom's right behind you.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.200
Thank you.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.560
Because you haven't, as far as I know, gone to the bathroom yet since you've been here.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.680
I took a shit, dude.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.920
That's a real odd thing to say to somebody.

43:03.480 --> 43:06.520
Dude, in real Delta Green, are you supposed to take shits?

43:06.520 --> 43:08.120
I took a shit right before the meeting.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.360
That pre-meeting shit.

43:10.360 --> 43:14.360
You have to be careful because you might get disorders related to, like, pooping your pants

43:14.360 --> 43:15.160
and stuff.

43:15.160 --> 43:20.200
Yeah, no, Luke had that through all, like, a year and a half of our first campaign.

43:20.200 --> 43:21.880
So we got a lot of shit jokes.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.600
They're usually pretty good.

43:24.600 --> 43:27.480
Well, mine was from digging through my own poop, I think.

43:28.760 --> 43:29.260
Yeah.

43:29.820 --> 43:31.500
There were little spider eggs in it.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.900
You can hang out there, water cooler, restroom.

43:35.900 --> 43:38.380
I would like to dig around in her desk.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.420
Okay, roll me a search.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.020
Pass 19 on a 50.

43:43.020 --> 43:44.860
Anyone else searching or just that?

43:44.860 --> 43:46.300
It's fine if it's just that.

43:46.300 --> 43:47.100
I'm not pushing.

43:47.740 --> 43:51.900
Well, I think Harlan would be not searching the desk, but peeping down hallways, just

43:51.900 --> 43:53.820
kind of getting a lay of the building.

43:53.820 --> 43:56.540
Okay, roll me an alertness for that.

43:56.540 --> 43:59.260
Cindy is putting on her cardigan and cheaters.

44:00.940 --> 44:02.620
I pass my alertness roll.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.300
It's a 35 on a 50.

44:04.300 --> 44:08.540
All right, alertness, all you see or hear for that matter, she goes up some stairs to

44:08.540 --> 44:12.380
some sort of offices upstairs, looking down the longer hallways to the left or right.

44:12.380 --> 44:13.420
They're totally dark.

44:13.420 --> 44:15.820
There's no movement or anything else.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.380
It's probably much busier during the day than it is right now.

44:18.380 --> 44:20.060
In fact, the lights are largely off.

44:20.620 --> 44:22.860
It's pretty dimly lit, actually, inside.

44:22.860 --> 44:25.020
They're conserving those taxpayer dollars.

44:25.740 --> 44:31.820
With that search role, you go through her desk, you find her purse, you find standard

44:31.820 --> 44:32.460
stuff in there.

44:32.460 --> 44:40.220
ID, lipstick, mirror, no cell phone yet, and her name is Jennifer Kahn.

44:40.220 --> 44:43.740
You also see that on her desk, on her name tag.

44:43.740 --> 44:44.860
K-H-A-N.

44:44.860 --> 44:47.580
So nothing out of the ordinary in here?

44:47.580 --> 44:49.100
Nothing out of the ordinary.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.620
She's gone for a couple minutes.

44:50.620 --> 44:53.500
Has she gone for long enough for us to yell after her?

44:53.500 --> 44:54.460
Maybe her last name?

44:55.020 --> 44:58.380
I was going to do it.

44:58.380 --> 45:01.740
You didn't have to ask.

45:01.740 --> 45:08.460
While they're making Star Trek jokes, Jodine goes and uses the bathroom.

45:08.460 --> 45:14.860
Yeah, after I rifle around her desk, I also go use the bathroom.

45:16.060 --> 45:18.220
Okay, great.

45:18.220 --> 45:23.020
So after a couple minutes, she comes back, assuming neither of you took that long in

45:23.020 --> 45:26.140
the bathroom, you can still be in the bathroom finishing your business if you really want

45:26.140 --> 45:35.340
to when she comes back, but she comes back with an alder man dressed neatly in a suit

45:35.980 --> 45:38.060
and he introduces himself.

45:38.060 --> 45:40.380
Hello there, I'm Bradley Allen.

45:40.380 --> 45:42.940
I reach out my hand to shake it.

45:42.940 --> 45:44.700
Oh, freshly washed.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.220
It's not, I didn't pee on my hand.

45:48.220 --> 45:51.180
He did though, but he didn't say that.

45:51.820 --> 45:52.540
He just thinks it.

45:53.100 --> 45:53.740
Okay, good.

45:54.620 --> 45:55.180
It's clean.

45:55.180 --> 45:56.380
Roll me a persuade.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.220
It's got to beat his smell roll.

46:00.220 --> 46:00.860
I got a three.

46:02.460 --> 46:03.740
And then against my human.

46:05.420 --> 46:08.220
Ah, yeah, that 42 is going to beat your three opposed.

46:08.220 --> 46:08.720
I'm sorry.

46:10.300 --> 46:14.780
So the first thing, the first impression this guy gets of us is that he shakes his hand

46:14.780 --> 46:22.540
and he knows it and he smells it and it smells like asparagus and he's like, oh, yeah.

46:22.940 --> 46:23.740
That's bullshit.

46:23.740 --> 46:25.740
You guys need to get some different soap in there.

46:25.740 --> 46:29.020
Asparagus soap is very odd choice, very odd choice.

46:29.580 --> 46:34.140
And then I just kind of fall back a little bit and just look down at my shoes.

46:35.420 --> 46:37.660
He wipes it on his suit, his pant leg.

46:38.220 --> 46:41.020
Well, what can I help the other three of you with?

46:41.020 --> 46:43.260
We are with a special DEA task force.

46:43.820 --> 46:49.580
We've got some questions for you regarding, well, frankly, your daughter and her friend,

46:50.300 --> 46:51.260
Billy race baby.

46:51.260 --> 46:53.180
Oh, would you, is there some more private?

46:53.180 --> 46:53.740
We can talk.

46:55.580 --> 46:56.220
Yeah, we can.

46:56.220 --> 46:58.380
Let's grab one of these side offices right here.

46:58.380 --> 47:02.540
I do want to assure you that at this moment, your daughter is not considered a suspect

47:02.540 --> 47:05.180
or involved in any criminal activity.

47:05.180 --> 47:07.020
Is she okay?

47:07.020 --> 47:08.300
We have some questions for you, sir.

47:08.300 --> 47:09.900
Can we, can we go into another room?

47:09.900 --> 47:10.860
Uh, yes.

47:11.580 --> 47:12.860
You're already in one room.

47:17.340 --> 47:18.540
One question per room.

47:20.540 --> 47:21.980
Let's try out a different one.

47:21.980 --> 47:22.700
I'm sorry, sir.

47:22.700 --> 47:27.500
The vibes in this room are just, they're kind of assaulting me right now.

47:27.500 --> 47:31.980
Could we go to, yes, I can take you to another office if you'd like.

47:31.980 --> 47:35.740
Is there one that looked like a nice view of the main intersection, main street?

47:35.740 --> 47:39.340
Is there one where you could tell us when was the last time you saw your daughter?

47:39.340 --> 47:41.100
That's ultimately what we need to know.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.300
No, we don't have one of those rooms.

47:42.300 --> 47:43.260
Oh shoot.

47:43.260 --> 47:44.860
Well, could you tell us anyway?

47:44.860 --> 47:48.780
I can take you to the room where I am pretty evasive with my answers to these questions.

47:49.820 --> 47:51.660
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

47:51.660 --> 47:54.780
Why don't we go to your office and we'll just, you can evade and we'll

47:54.780 --> 47:57.500
humant and we'll see what we get.

47:57.500 --> 47:58.300
I'd rather not.

47:59.020 --> 48:02.220
Yeah, but we're the DEA, so why don't you show us that office, Alderman?

48:02.220 --> 48:05.980
I'd rather go to the room where you don't humant and you just listen to me

48:05.980 --> 48:08.300
and take everything I say on face as the truth.

48:08.300 --> 48:10.060
Oh sure, that's what we meant by your office.

48:10.060 --> 48:10.620
Let's go.

48:10.620 --> 48:11.660
We all wink at each other.

48:13.180 --> 48:14.460
Do you have something in your eyes?

48:14.460 --> 48:14.960
Yeah.

48:15.660 --> 48:16.460
Truth.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.220
You don't want to look into my partner's eyes.

48:19.580 --> 48:22.300
Are you making fun of my lazy eye?

48:22.300 --> 48:25.180
Oh, I forgot about Harlan's weird eye.

48:26.220 --> 48:28.300
Why don't you show us to your office, Alderman?

48:28.300 --> 48:29.980
Yeah, this is uncomfortable now.

48:29.980 --> 48:30.620
Mm-hmm.

48:30.620 --> 48:31.260
Good.

48:31.260 --> 48:31.900
I'm very busy.

48:31.900 --> 48:32.460
I have to go.

48:33.580 --> 48:34.460
Yeah, we'll go with you.

48:35.820 --> 48:36.860
We just follow him.

48:40.540 --> 48:42.700
You can just work while we ask you questions.

48:42.700 --> 48:44.300
I'm just joshing around, guys.

48:44.300 --> 48:46.300
It's hilarious.

48:46.300 --> 48:47.020
Face guy.

48:48.460 --> 48:49.420
I'm just joshing.

48:49.660 --> 48:50.220
That's good.

48:50.220 --> 48:50.700
I'm joshing.

48:50.700 --> 48:51.500
That's good.

48:51.500 --> 48:55.660
So would you say it's been more than two weeks since you saw your daughter?

48:55.660 --> 48:56.700
Yeah, probably.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.700
What kind of drugs is your wife on?

48:59.500 --> 49:01.340
I assume she's just high on life.

49:01.340 --> 49:04.060
We're God-fearing people in this town.

49:04.060 --> 49:04.560
Okay.

49:05.180 --> 49:08.540
We talked to your wife and it doesn't really add up.

49:08.540 --> 49:11.100
So you haven't seen your daughter in like three weeks.

49:11.820 --> 49:15.900
And that's not normal, but you're fine with it.

49:15.900 --> 49:17.020
She's an independent girl.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.020
I've been busy at work.

49:19.100 --> 49:20.220
I don't think it's that big of a deal.

49:20.220 --> 49:21.900
What's been keeping you so busy?

49:21.900 --> 49:22.940
It's tax season.

49:24.140 --> 49:26.780
Can I human Tim saying, I don't think it's that big of a deal.

49:26.780 --> 49:28.060
Also, it's September.

49:28.060 --> 49:29.260
It isn't taxi.

49:29.260 --> 49:30.940
Same in our County.

49:30.940 --> 49:32.860
It is 14 success.

49:33.500 --> 49:35.980
62 on a 16 fail.

49:35.980 --> 49:36.540
What are we?

49:36.540 --> 49:36.860
Okay.

49:36.860 --> 49:37.660
I failed mine.

49:38.300 --> 49:38.780
Human.

49:40.220 --> 49:42.300
Oh no, I got a 99.

49:45.420 --> 49:46.380
That's pretty bad.

49:46.460 --> 49:56.860
Luke's like, tell me, Luke is now actively working for him with the conspiracy guys.

49:56.860 --> 49:57.740
Leave him alone.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.060
It all makes sense.

50:00.060 --> 50:01.340
Now she's an adult.

50:01.340 --> 50:02.700
She can do what she wants.

50:02.700 --> 50:10.060
He is not being evasive, but he also has kind of a similar level of deadness.

50:10.060 --> 50:15.900
As far as his empathy goes similar to his wife where he is saying it doesn't bother

50:15.900 --> 50:16.460
him.

50:16.460 --> 50:20.620
It doesn't seem like it bothers him, but he also doesn't seem like he's some like psychopathic

50:20.620 --> 50:21.980
serial killer either.

50:21.980 --> 50:24.220
So it's somewhere kind of in between that golf.

50:24.220 --> 50:25.900
There's something a little not there.

50:26.620 --> 50:28.220
It's like Stepfordy.

50:28.220 --> 50:28.700
Yeah.

50:28.700 --> 50:31.180
And we didn't get that impression from the sheriff.

50:31.180 --> 50:32.700
Not to the same extent.

50:32.700 --> 50:33.420
No.

50:33.420 --> 50:33.900
Okay.

50:33.900 --> 50:35.420
This the sheriff was weird too.

50:35.420 --> 50:36.220
But a little bit.

50:36.220 --> 50:36.540
Yeah.

50:36.540 --> 50:38.860
I feel like I was like, what's going on?

50:38.860 --> 50:42.300
What does what's going on in your town bother you or is anything in your town bothering

50:42.300 --> 50:42.780
you?

50:42.780 --> 50:43.020
Yeah.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.900
And he was just like, basically everything's peachy keen.

50:45.900 --> 50:46.060
No.

50:46.060 --> 50:48.220
Wasn't he like, are you saying I'm a bad sheriff?

50:48.220 --> 50:48.460
Yeah.

50:48.460 --> 50:50.460
But I feel like that was his version of it.

50:50.460 --> 50:56.060
Like he got defensive in an attempt to cover up the fact that he doesn't truly believe

50:56.060 --> 50:57.500
that anything is wrong.

50:57.500 --> 51:01.980
My problem was I tried to ask a leading question instead of just doing a vibe check.

51:03.900 --> 51:05.820
We go up to everyone else the rest of the time.

51:05.820 --> 51:07.100
We're like, Hey, excuse me.

51:07.100 --> 51:08.620
Can I roll vibes on this motherfucker?

51:08.620 --> 51:11.100
Mr.

51:11.100 --> 51:15.900
Allen, could you describe your daughter's relationship with Mr.

51:15.900 --> 51:16.380
Spivvy?

51:16.940 --> 51:18.140
Oh, that boy.

51:18.140 --> 51:19.420
Boy's no good for her.

51:19.420 --> 51:20.540
She's going places.

51:21.100 --> 51:22.620
Boy's just dragging her down.

51:22.620 --> 51:24.380
But that's why you people were here.

51:24.380 --> 51:25.660
Because of him and those drugs.

51:25.660 --> 51:26.460
That's what the sheriff said.

51:26.460 --> 51:26.700
Yeah.

51:26.700 --> 51:27.740
He's a brick.

51:27.740 --> 51:28.620
He is a brick.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.020
He's like a brick of this new super meth.

51:31.020 --> 51:32.140
Drowning her slowly.

51:32.140 --> 51:32.860
Yeah.

51:32.860 --> 51:35.900
I don't think the civilian is necessarily privy to maybe all that.

51:35.900 --> 51:36.620
Oh, you're right.

51:36.620 --> 51:39.820
I have a hard time keeping all my information to myself.

51:39.820 --> 51:41.020
Here's the deal, Alderman.

51:41.740 --> 51:45.580
You say she was hanging out with a boy that you knew was trouble.

51:45.580 --> 51:46.220
He's trouble.

51:46.220 --> 51:47.820
You say she's going places, though.

51:47.820 --> 51:49.980
The Ohio State University.

51:49.980 --> 51:50.780
Ohio State University.

51:50.780 --> 51:52.540
The Ohio State University.

51:52.540 --> 51:53.820
I put in a good word.

51:53.820 --> 51:58.860
Isn't it odd that Ohio State University backwards is USO?

52:00.620 --> 52:01.980
That's pretty similar to UFO.

52:01.980 --> 52:04.140
And that's just a little coincidence I noted.

52:04.140 --> 52:08.860
But going on, don't you think it's odd that a boy you do not enjoy, let's put it that

52:08.860 --> 52:13.180
way, this spivvy boy, he's been running around with your daughter.

52:13.180 --> 52:13.980
You think he's trouble.

52:14.700 --> 52:15.900
You say she's going places.

52:15.900 --> 52:16.300
Yep.

52:16.300 --> 52:20.220
And she's in fact been places unknown for the past three weeks.

52:20.220 --> 52:21.580
What are you suggesting?

52:21.580 --> 52:23.660
Why aren't you worried about that?

52:23.660 --> 52:26.140
Well, that spivvy boy, he's in custody, right?

52:26.140 --> 52:29.260
As of yesterday night or this morning, correct?

52:29.260 --> 52:30.940
I got nothing to worry about.

52:30.940 --> 52:32.300
He's going to stay away from my girl.

52:33.260 --> 52:40.780
Do you know anybody that has been abducted around here by aliens or unidentified things?

52:40.780 --> 52:44.060
Why does it always have to come back to aliens in this town?

52:44.060 --> 52:44.620
Well, you know.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.860
You can't just conduct a normal drug investigation.

52:46.860 --> 52:49.820
You got to ask the nonsense alien questions, just like every reporter.

52:49.820 --> 52:54.380
If you would have ever seen this meth, you would say it's otherworldly.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.980
Ah, nice.

52:55.980 --> 52:56.860
It's pretty cool meth.

52:57.500 --> 53:02.060
Now, can I human him on his...

53:02.060 --> 53:03.340
I guess that would be what it is.

53:03.340 --> 53:09.180
I want to know if this anger about the UFOs, which the sheriff also demonstrated.

53:09.180 --> 53:12.700
Is that legitimate, like hometown pride, like we're the butt of all these jokes?

53:13.500 --> 53:15.260
Or is that defensive?

53:16.460 --> 53:18.540
Why is everybody asking about aliens?

53:21.580 --> 53:22.060
18.

53:22.060 --> 53:22.860
Oh, yes.

53:22.860 --> 53:23.100
All right.

53:23.180 --> 53:27.340
With your 18, you know that they're definitely the butt end of the jokes

53:27.340 --> 53:30.460
based on your interaction with the sheriff as well as him.

53:30.460 --> 53:35.580
You know, people in authority here don't like their town being looked at as this kind of laughing stock.

53:35.580 --> 53:36.540
That makes sense.

53:36.540 --> 53:42.540
It's unclear if he's actively hiding anything, but he's definitely defensive about it.

53:42.540 --> 53:42.940
Gotcha.

53:42.940 --> 53:44.700
But it is just like the sheriff.

53:44.700 --> 53:47.500
He's like, I fucking hate that my town is this.

53:47.500 --> 53:51.420
And as the town leader, he seems to have a really good reason to feel that way.

53:51.420 --> 53:52.780
As far as you know, that's it.

53:53.020 --> 53:55.020
Because you didn't crit succeed, Thomas.

53:55.740 --> 53:56.140
Hey, man.

53:57.580 --> 54:03.180
Hey, just popped in my head.

54:03.180 --> 54:05.340
Do you have any tattoos?

54:06.060 --> 54:09.740
Or maybe you could show us your arm or your leg.

54:09.740 --> 54:11.580
That's a very forward question.

54:11.580 --> 54:12.940
Oh, look, I got tattoos.

54:12.940 --> 54:16.220
This one is Japanese for diligence.

54:16.220 --> 54:17.100
I do.

54:17.100 --> 54:17.580
Oh, what?

54:17.980 --> 54:21.820
I have May I please.

54:23.260 --> 54:27.980
So he takes off his suit jacket that starts rolling up his sleeve like he's going to give blood.

54:27.980 --> 54:30.860
And you see right on the inside of his right forearm.

54:30.860 --> 54:34.220
He's got one of those sweet infinity sign tattoos.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.660
Nice upon closer inspection.

54:40.700 --> 54:42.540
Oh, yeah, let me get a closer look at that.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.540
We're all just digging our eyes.

54:44.540 --> 54:47.420
Woodabaga just grabs his arm and brings it up to all of our eyes.

54:47.420 --> 54:49.100
I pass with a 40 on a seven.

54:49.100 --> 54:50.460
I got another 99.

54:50.460 --> 54:52.460
No, 44.

54:53.340 --> 54:56.460
Oh, I passed with a plain old two.

54:56.460 --> 55:00.140
You rip his arm out of his socket, but then I am able to get a good look at it.

55:01.340 --> 55:05.740
I think you've crit success on, like, every person that you've looked at closely at this point.

55:06.860 --> 55:10.700
So the first time on Billy Ray, you definitively saw marks.

55:10.700 --> 55:13.580
And then it was Nancy, the mom.

55:13.580 --> 55:13.820
Yes.

55:13.820 --> 55:16.140
Yeah, definitively did not have it.

55:16.140 --> 55:18.940
And he also definitively does not have it.

55:18.940 --> 55:19.740
Same with the sheriff.

55:19.740 --> 55:24.700
Nowhere on his exposed arms, on his neck, hands, anything that you can see exposed right now.

55:24.700 --> 55:29.340
He definitively does not have the same kind of muscle punctures.

55:29.340 --> 55:32.940
Sorry, it's just my partner here has tattoos.

55:32.940 --> 55:35.660
And then we've been working on this task force with Tan here.

55:35.660 --> 55:38.940
So they've all been just razzing me about, you know, when are you going to get yours?

55:38.940 --> 55:39.660
When do you get yours?

55:39.660 --> 55:41.100
And I'm like, it's 1992.

55:41.100 --> 55:44.860
We're like 20 years away from that being really socially acceptable.

55:44.860 --> 55:48.060
Just, you know, in a professional job, maybe even 30.

55:48.060 --> 55:51.100
If I had to give a rust out cement, that's just what I've been saying to them.

55:51.100 --> 55:55.260
So that's why we were really, uh, that's why we wanted to just get all up and look at your tattoo.

55:55.260 --> 55:56.940
It's just been on our minds lately.

55:56.940 --> 55:57.900
I hope you like it.

55:57.900 --> 55:58.140
Yeah.

55:58.140 --> 55:58.860
What's it mean?

55:58.860 --> 56:00.300
It means infinity.

56:00.300 --> 56:01.660
Oh, I thought it was eight.

56:01.660 --> 56:02.060
Nice.

56:02.060 --> 56:05.820
Oh, that happens sometimes, you know.

56:07.180 --> 56:10.620
Do you ever use your computer to look up tattoo ideas?

56:10.620 --> 56:12.780
Maybe we could go use your computer real quick.

56:13.660 --> 56:14.460
Thank you.

56:14.460 --> 56:14.780
Okay.

56:15.420 --> 56:18.060
In the office that you're currently in, there is a computer.

56:18.620 --> 56:20.540
He can crack it open for you.

56:20.540 --> 56:23.180
There's not really such a thing as cyber security at this point.

56:23.180 --> 56:25.260
There's not even a login really to get on.

56:25.820 --> 56:32.540
And he fires up the 28-8 modem on that computer and you hear that sweet, sweet sound of

56:32.540 --> 56:49.340
And, uh, Joe, I think you said you have a AOL account.

56:49.340 --> 56:53.580
Character Joe or no, Joe's still rocking an AOL account.

56:53.580 --> 56:54.940
Joe's like, this will be confusing.

56:54.940 --> 56:55.900
And I was like, no, it's fine.

56:56.860 --> 56:57.340
Yeah.

56:57.340 --> 56:58.380
It's really confusing.

56:58.380 --> 56:58.700
Sorry.

56:59.580 --> 57:03.260
Player Thomas, character Joe, you said you had an AOL account?

57:03.900 --> 57:12.300
Yeah, it's Joe, capital D-E-A, lowercase n at aol.com.

57:12.300 --> 57:13.180
Joe Dean.

57:13.180 --> 57:14.460
Okay, great.

57:15.180 --> 57:19.820
You log in and then you get the, you've got mail.

57:19.820 --> 57:20.060
Okay.

57:20.060 --> 57:21.100
Joe Dean clicks his mail.

57:21.820 --> 57:22.860
Who's it from?

57:22.860 --> 57:23.580
Your AOL.

57:24.540 --> 57:26.300
Your AOL.

57:26.300 --> 57:28.300
Now it'll probably be from one of my bonds, right?

57:28.860 --> 57:30.140
Sounds role-play appropriate.

57:30.700 --> 57:37.740
So I've got my rich brother, Jim Dean, uh, and then my mom and my dad.

57:37.740 --> 57:43.260
I think this is a really shitty chain email from Jim, especially in 1992.

57:43.820 --> 57:47.420
He's probably the only reason I have an internet, like an AOL account right now.

57:47.420 --> 57:51.180
Like last Thanksgiving, he was like, yeah, personal computer.

57:51.180 --> 57:54.460
The, you know, the nerds came in, wired up my home.

57:54.460 --> 57:57.500
I've got, uh, I've got access to the whole world right now, baby.

57:58.060 --> 57:59.820
And it's just a shitty AOL chat room.

57:59.820 --> 58:03.020
And he made you look like a fool at your own Thanksgiving dinner.

58:03.020 --> 58:08.060
So that's a lifelong pattern that I've talked to you about in more vulnerable moments.

58:08.060 --> 58:08.940
Agent would have begun.

58:08.940 --> 58:09.740
Oh yeah, sorry.

58:11.980 --> 58:13.020
Bring that up.

58:13.020 --> 58:16.460
Anyway, it's literally just a shitty joke email from his brother, Jim.

58:16.460 --> 58:19.580
Do you guys remember any, uh, nineties joke chain emails?

58:19.580 --> 58:20.540
It's probably just the,

58:20.540 --> 58:22.220
my mom used to fucking love those all.

58:22.220 --> 58:24.780
This is like a little bit before that for sure.

58:25.420 --> 58:29.180
It's not one of those emails where it's like, if you don't forward this to at least 10 people,

58:29.180 --> 58:30.860
you're going to have bad luck kind of thing.

58:30.860 --> 58:31.500
Exactly.

58:31.500 --> 58:31.900
Yeah.

58:31.900 --> 58:32.220
Yeah.

58:32.220 --> 58:32.700
It's that.

58:32.700 --> 58:36.700
And then it's also a lot of, uh, weird proto Clinton conspiracy jokes.

58:39.020 --> 58:41.340
Joe Dean's like, man, I hope this doesn't, you know,

58:41.340 --> 58:45.900
take weird route in the public consciousness so that a lot, you know, anyway, I hope this

58:45.900 --> 58:48.300
doesn't sink a really viable candidate.

58:49.020 --> 58:50.300
Hey Joe, here's that card.

58:51.900 --> 58:53.580
I hand you the business card.

58:53.580 --> 58:55.500
I hope this country doesn't hate women enough.

58:56.300 --> 58:57.500
Watch the skies.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.780
Orange piece of shit.

58:58.780 --> 59:00.220
AOL.com.

59:01.820 --> 59:02.860
I'm done with my musings.

59:02.860 --> 59:03.580
Well, what do you do?

59:03.580 --> 59:05.500
What do you do with that email address?

59:05.500 --> 59:07.660
Well, Joe Dean, he's like, I got this boys.

59:07.660 --> 59:11.180
Watch this over to like compose mail or whatever.

59:12.140 --> 59:15.980
Types in the email address, subject line, D E.

59:16.060 --> 59:16.300
Hey.

59:22.220 --> 59:29.500
And he says, hello, I'm in Grover's Ville for a few days.

59:30.140 --> 59:32.700
Curious, uh, re UFOs.

59:33.500 --> 59:35.020
Wanted to ask you some cues.

59:35.580 --> 59:38.620
You can get back to me here or just set a time that we meet.

59:38.620 --> 59:41.180
Cause I don't know if we're going to get access to the email again.

59:41.180 --> 59:42.300
That is such a good idea.

59:42.300 --> 59:45.100
I was like, oh, I've been wondering about that the whole time.

59:45.100 --> 59:47.100
Like this, how do we get a computer again?

59:47.820 --> 59:50.700
This conspiracy dude is going to love it if I'm just like, yeah.

59:50.700 --> 59:50.940
Yeah.

59:50.940 --> 59:53.500
Meet at the mega deuce at noon tomorrow.

59:53.500 --> 59:56.780
Sincerely, John Dean, federal agent.

59:56.780 --> 59:57.500
Aggressive.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.340
I want him to think I might know things.

59:59.340 --> 59:59.900
What's that?

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.820
A with the circle around it.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.940
That stands for at.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.300
Asked and answered.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.580
It's called an apostrophe.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.860
I think I believe that's correct.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.540
Email was sent.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.180
Yep.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.460
You've got mail.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.100
Ooh.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.060
Auto reply.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.500
Oh, it's my fucking brother again.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.260
Did you get two messages perhaps?

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:21.900
Oh, I did.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.420
Look, the Dilbert guy messaged us back.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.340
You.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:27.820
Yes.

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.700
Did get an auto reply straight to your email.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.900
So auto reply, uh, read D E Hey.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:41.420
And in the body of the email, it says I'm out of the office for at least the next couple of weeks.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:45.900
Investigating what's happening in Grover's Ville.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.940
I will get back to you at my earliest convenience.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:53.260
Signed Scott Adams, not the creator of Dilbert.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.300
And he gives a address in Knoxville.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.860
Is there a telephone in this office we're in?

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.620
There is in fact a telephone in this office.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.660
Are you going to call that address?

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.140
No, I'm going to call the number that was on the back of the card.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.580
Uh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.980
Is the alderman still in the office for this?

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:10.460
Yeah.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:13.820
Sir, you're, we're going to have to commandeer your office for the next, uh,

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.100
roughly 10 minutes, uh, for an urgent federal business.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.940
Uh, we're about to call our boss.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.980
We need to commandeer your phone.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.260
Could you please step outside?

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.180
Cindy will start walking out the door with him alongside Jodine.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.220
You're escorting him out?

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:26.380
Yeah.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.820
We just started escorting him out.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.940
But yeah, it's okay.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.420
But yeah, it's just only for a little bit.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.060
You're all right.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:32.700
It's okay.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.420
You got busy.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.420
Remember you said you had to get back to work, right?

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.060
Yeah.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:36.540
10 minutes.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.260
But that other alderman's wondering where you are.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.220
Probably got to talk to him.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:41.740
Okay.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.460
I'll wait.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.380
You know, do you need to ask me any more questions or should I just go back to work?

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.500
Now you can fuck off.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.000
Thanks.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.660
Great meeting you all.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.380
But wait.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.940
Except for she realizes she's wearing the cardigan.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.140
She's like, Oh, wrong voice.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:54.860
Ah, dammit.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:57.900
Okay.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.540
He fucks off.

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.740
He goes upstairs back doing whatever he's doing upstairs with taxes.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.620
And you're gonna make that phone call?

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.100
Yes.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:11.100
I'm dialing beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.260
No, I need rotary phone sounds.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:20.460
Oh, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.180
All right.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.900
Now I need that trademarked ring that you guys do.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:24.860
Oh, so well.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.820
We'll put it in.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.380
I don't think I've ever actually heard this.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.580
I'll do it in post Taylor.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.080
Really?

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.980
Thomas doesn't listen to the show.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.340
No, I'm not allowed to listen.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.060
I need to do a re-listen, but sorry.

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.020
It's one of my favorite parts.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:41.740
Everybody talks about it on the forums.

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.380
And it's from an episode I was not previously allowed to listen to.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.020
It's it's good stuff.

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:53.980
You call it rings once or twice, and then you get that dial-up modem sound on the back end.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.380
Sort of like when you call a fax machine or something else.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.540
Not ringing like a normal phone.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.180
Listen to this.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.620
What's happening?

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.420
It's a, that sounds like a fax machine.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.740
It looks like maybe he was expecting documents of some sort.

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:10.380
I hang up.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.020
Should we fax him something?

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.020
Is there a fax machine in the alderman's office?

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.500
There is.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.340
I write what you wrote in your email.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.980
You send that.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.740
It bounces back.

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.780
Fax unable to send.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.340
It's not.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.860
So apparently it's not a fax machine.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.460
It's actually a modem on the receiving end.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:26.220
Does that just mean he's on the internet?

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:26.460
Yeah.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:26.620
Yeah.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.180
Okay.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.260
So Joe doesn't know why a person would write down an internet address,

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.100
modem address on a piece of paper.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.940
But, uh, my character probably would.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.740
It's a no, no, no.

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.140
He didn't.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:36.620
He didn't.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:36.860
He.

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.900
So remember back in the day, you couldn't use the phone if you were connected to the internet

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:40.780
or like, yeah.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.740
Oh, that's what you're saying.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.740
It's it's like we, yeah, exactly.

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.540
Gotcha.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.180
Well, okay.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.260
You used to get just to get a busy tone if that happened.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.540
Oh, maybe in 1992.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:51.820
I mean, who has computer science?

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.220
I do.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.380
Who are you calling when you were three years old?

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.220
You can wait.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.020
You can roll me some.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.660
But you don't have to answer this, but how old are you?

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.180
I was born in the mid eighties.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:02.140
All right.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:02.300
Yeah.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.140
I'm the oldest one here.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:08.780
And I remember AOL at age six, uh, doing exactly this.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.660
If you picked up the phone line in the household, that's what you heard.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:15.180
But if you called into that house, it was just dial tone.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.940
That's a fail 73 on a 50 computer science.

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.940
Well, you have a 50 anyway, you would know this.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.460
This is one of those like base.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.620
Hold on for Joe's information.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:30.860
That means the call is coming from inside the house in this building using the internet.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:31.980
Or it's just us.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.300
I log off of AOL and we make the call again.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.420
Oh my God.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.780
It was a puzzle this whole time.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:46.780
David, we just had to get off the internet puzzle.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.580
You are the ones that killed all those people.

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:53.740
Damn.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.460
And that's it.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.020
We're done.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.300
I inspect my own arm.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.540
You're the aliens.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.940
We're all covered in tiny little needle marks.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.060
You call that happens.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.380
Okay.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.060
Maybe you're right in real life.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.140
It would be a busy signal in this world.

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.220
The way the technology works, that means it's, it's logged in.

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.700
That's the point of that you're supposed to get.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:21.020
I will give you something else just cause no one has, uh, the telecommunications,

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.940
uh, networking skill.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:29.980
One thing you would notice that phone number is area code nine three one, which is not

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.980
a Knoxville phone number.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.340
So it's a different area code than the phone number on the footer of his email.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.980
Nine three one is the area code for this County.

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.900
So it seems to be a local number.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.260
He might be staying at the same motel we're staying at.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:43.740
Oh yeah.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.100
Let's just go ahead and can we call Merle's the front desk?

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.740
Cause I assume there's a phone book in here or we have there is a phone book.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:56.620
So, um, let's, let's call Merle's and ask if, uh, if the Scott Adams is standing there

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.740
and if he created Dilbert.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.420
Bring, bring.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.060
Merle's shut eye.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.340
How can I help you?

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.860
Hey, this is one of the Sheriff's, uh, down at, uh, this is one of the deputies

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.620
down at the Sheriff's office.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.980
Have you got a Scott Adams stand with y'all?

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.140
Uh, let me check.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.220
And you hear some papers in the background.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.020
Um, yeah, we got a, we got a Scott Adams here.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:23.420
Um, he's been here for a hot second as the kids say.

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.340
Let me check the records.

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.020
Oh, do they say that yet?

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:27.660
They do here.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.540
This is, this is actually the town it originates in, in the early nineties.

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:38.220
Eventually proliferate elsewhere, but give me a hot second and yes.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.580
Oh no, he's been here.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:43.980
Uh, he has been, he's been here for a couple of weeks now.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.340
It looks like he's paid up for three more nights.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.380
What's his room number?

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:48.940
I'm sorry.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:53.820
Uh, who is this asking specifically about, uh, people saying at this, uh, motel that

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.940
I probably should ask that before, um, I just give away information like this

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.060
willy nilly on the phone.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:02.140
Oh, deputy Clark down from the, the Groversville Ferris department.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.740
Your deputy Clark.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.860
Well, I'm new in case there's a deputy Clark, you know, and don't like.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:08.780
Oh, okay.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:08.940
Yes.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.380
That's why they got me on the night shift.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:10.700
Yeah.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:11.260
That okay.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:11.820
That makes sense.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:12.300
Sure.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.260
Um, yeah, no, no, no.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:13.900
He's here.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:17.180
Uh, he has two rooms down here at the motel.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.180
Two rooms and all these unpaid parking tickets.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.660
What a, which is what we're after him for.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.260
He's paid up for three more days.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.860
He should have paid his parking tickets.

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:31.820
He has one room he's staying in and, um, there is a second room, uh, for storage

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:34.460
of research materials, whatever that means.

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:34.860
Wow.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.860
He just put all that on his book and yeah, it's all, it's all here.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.500
And what was your name?

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.780
I'm the manager by the way.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.380
Uh, my name is Riker Yates.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.300
Strong name.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.180
Very strong name.

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.060
That's a strong name.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.020
Riker Yates.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:47.820
Thank you.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:52.220
Well, I was deputy, uh, you remember and I will, you have a pleasant night.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.460
Hey, ask him about the UFOs.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.660
You liked that UFO stuff?

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:00.300
Why is it always about the UFOs?

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:04.300
Click.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.300
Hi.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.940
No, I can't get high.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.700
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.580
It must be something inside of me.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:46.300
Does anybody know why I can't get high?

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:54.140
I can't sit though I can't and I don't want to try.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.140
Don't want to try.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:04.140
Please miss me won't you spare me something more can you buy.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.140
Where do you begin?

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.140
I don't know how.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.980
I don't know how.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:21.980
Hallucinations so big time but spiders out the night.

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.980
Spiders out the night.

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:31.980
Breathing in, breathing out.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:39.980
I've been hiding in low low places with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:47.820
And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.

01:09:47.820 --> 01:10:17.660
I think I'm allergic or something better gone with nothing so I won't get high.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:23.500
No I won't get high.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.500
By all means do it if it helps.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.500
For me it makes my brain melt.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:39.500
Does anybody know why I can't get high?

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:47.500
I can't sit though I can't and I don't want to try.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:57.500
Please miss me won't you spare me something more can you buy.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:01.500
Where do you begin?

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:05.500
I don't know how.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:13.500
Hallucinations so big time but spiders out the night.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:23.500
Breathing in, breathing out.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:31.500
I've been hiding in low low places with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:37.500
And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom.
