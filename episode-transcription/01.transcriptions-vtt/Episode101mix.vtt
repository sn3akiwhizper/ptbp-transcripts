00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
What is happening my students?

00:03.200 --> 00:07.300
It's your professor of wolf studies, Wolf, the dog.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.520
And I'm here to lecture you about the various bones

00:10.520 --> 00:12.780
that wolves like me possess.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.720
How much cream is in the body?

00:15.720 --> 00:19.080
How much grease the fur retains?

00:19.080 --> 00:21.360
You know, college stuff.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.360
And I am teaching it you live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:26.560 --> 00:30.320
the only radio show that delves into factual things

00:30.320 --> 00:34.080
regarding wolf the dog biology, my babies.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.760
Speaking of knowledge, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.960
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf was sent by Derek

00:40.960 --> 00:45.040
from the RGV, the Rio Grande Valley.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.380
They write, howdy y'all.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.320
Big shout out from South Texas

00:49.320 --> 00:52.940
to all the PTBP peeps near and far.

00:52.940 --> 00:56.000
Can't wait to get back to the boys in contention.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.920
And finally get to the bottom of this mystery.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.320
Don't get me wrong, all this timey wimey stuff

01:02.320 --> 01:06.100
is fun and all, but boy howdy does it give me a headache.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.440
If only there was a handy dandy recap

01:09.440 --> 01:14.240
that retold these events in a succinct but thorough fashion.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.660
Anyways, stay safe out there.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.120
Lots of love to the PTBP crew

01:19.120 --> 01:23.080
and a big eye woo to wolf the dog.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.860
Thanks for writing in Derek from the Rio Grande Valley.

01:26.860 --> 01:30.040
I hope one day to visit this mystical Texas

01:30.040 --> 01:31.920
that I've heard so much about.

01:31.920 --> 01:35.320
It sounds like a place that a wolf really could lay down

01:35.320 --> 01:38.560
a garbage nest to lay many eggs in.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.240
Anyway, if you wanna write up a little something

01:41.240 --> 01:43.780
for your wolfy wolfy to howl howl,

01:43.780 --> 01:46.560
tag us on the internet at PretendingPod

01:46.560 --> 01:49.840
or write a five star review on Apple Podcasts.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.520
And send us a screenshot at pretendedpod at gmail.com.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.360
And if you want 23 bonus episodes,

01:57.360 --> 02:00.520
become a citizen of contention for $5 a month

02:00.520 --> 02:04.280
over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.620
The link is in the show notes.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.040
There's a recording of the session zero

02:09.040 --> 02:12.680
for building contention and brainstorming PC ideas.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.200
There's some Q and A's,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.980
there's some really silly one shots

02:16.980 --> 02:21.660
and 10 of the episodes tied together in an ongoing story

02:21.660 --> 02:24.200
that has featured 11 different agents

02:24.200 --> 02:29.200
due to the brutal approach Zach has leaned

02:29.200 --> 02:33.500
into this more delta greenie, delta green campaign.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.420
All of which is homebrew except

02:35.420 --> 02:39.100
for the wonderfully disgusting scenario lover in the ice.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.960
But I'll stop peddling so y'all don't snooze.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.340
You know where I'm heading, it's time for the news.

02:45.340 --> 02:48.700
Last time, our three leading men came to

02:48.700 --> 02:53.340
in the darkness of Ari Manstein's mausoleum again.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.720
That's number four, if I remember correctly.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.740
And every single name on their bodies has been crossed out.

03:00.740 --> 03:03.780
After Keith revealed he went back in time,

03:03.780 --> 03:07.220
became Silas Cole and invented ball.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.040
Well, John got real angsty

03:09.040 --> 03:11.740
and poured out some pent up daddy issues

03:11.740 --> 03:14.780
while in his dad's body.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.780
The trio called an Uber and headed off to contention

03:17.780 --> 03:22.780
to nab the book on the way to calm comfy campgrounds

03:22.860 --> 03:25.120
to confront Maggie Cook.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.660
But the driver Spud in his vintage Volkswagen van

03:28.660 --> 03:31.140
couldn't evade the goo-nami

03:31.140 --> 03:35.020
that first consumed the bodies of Councilwoman Carrie Pages

03:35.020 --> 03:38.620
and Salem the cat atop a familiar four wheeler

03:38.620 --> 03:40.860
with an odd radio on the back

03:40.860 --> 03:42.460
before it eventually swallowed

03:42.460 --> 03:45.460
our narratively central characters as well.

03:46.340 --> 03:50.540
Same fucking shit got me too, goddamn goo.

03:50.540 --> 03:54.340
And now I can't see my pa in front of my ma,

03:54.340 --> 03:57.060
but I can hear, oh, I can hear.

03:57.060 --> 03:59.940
Be eternally grateful that you can too,

03:59.940 --> 04:03.340
if only for the privilege of blessing your body

04:03.340 --> 04:05.760
and the space between your functional ears

04:05.760 --> 04:09.360
with this impossible to over-hype song.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.040
And if I'm not right, then it's best to be wrong.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.480
It's Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

04:17.480 --> 04:23.480
["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]

04:23.480 --> 04:27.600
Bad girls on top of the water

04:27.600 --> 04:31.800
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline

04:31.800 --> 04:35.800
Leaving my mind at your altar

04:35.800 --> 04:37.960
Crossing the double line

04:37.960 --> 04:39.480
Doing it every time

04:39.480 --> 04:45.480
Tell me what kind of world are you living in

04:48.280 --> 04:53.280
What kind of world are you living in

04:57.120 --> 05:00.920
So I've realized we kind of have a finite number of episodes left

05:00.920 --> 05:04.200
before we start on like a new story

05:04.200 --> 05:07.360
and people might be like listening to it for the first time.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.600
We only have so many intros where people have already listened

05:11.600 --> 05:13.480
to like a hundred episodes of this probably

05:13.480 --> 05:14.480
if they're listening to this.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.520
So we can say some pretty messed up stuff

05:18.520 --> 05:19.880
and they'll keep listening.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.240
So I looked up on Quora

05:21.240 --> 05:25.080
what are the most inappropriate questions to ask people.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.780
So Joe, are you pregnant?

05:27.780 --> 05:28.840
Yes.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.080
Luke, are you wearing a wig?

05:32.080 --> 05:32.920
Yes.

05:33.920 --> 05:39.160
And Thomas, were you in jail because you murdered someone?

05:39.160 --> 05:42.920
Some ones, but yes.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.080
Someone's what?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.720
Some's one.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.200
I have a legitimate question though.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.120
Put it on Quora.

05:48.120 --> 05:53.920
Will it feel like if I put orchids in my bong and smoke it?

05:53.920 --> 05:57.960
Why on earth would I do that?

05:57.960 --> 05:58.840
Here's the deal.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.560
I have over 500 orchids

06:00.560 --> 06:02.760
and not one of them will get anyone high.

06:05.040 --> 06:08.280
So the other day you posted a thing on Instagram.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.640
You were like my favorite corner of the house.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.920
Yeah.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.360
You just kind of didn't mention that they were all

06:14.360 --> 06:16.400
it was a picture of plants, but they're all mine.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.040
Wow.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.540
That's stolen valor.

06:19.540 --> 06:20.380
I did not.

06:20.380 --> 06:25.380
That's stolen valor and I'd like an apology.

06:26.380 --> 06:30.380
I'm not going to apologize because nowhere in that post

06:30.380 --> 06:32.340
did I say that they were mine.

06:32.340 --> 06:36.140
They exist in my house and what I posted was

06:36.140 --> 06:39.900
this is the best corner of the living room, which is true.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.660
I did not say these are mine.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.700
So I'm not apologizing.

06:44.700 --> 06:48.020
Plant emoji and then a colon and then tag.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.260
Not going to happen.

06:49.260 --> 06:52.100
I'm going to comment on there right now.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.380
These are all mine.

06:56.380 --> 06:58.380
Thomas, how many plants do you have now?

06:58.380 --> 07:01.380
He has over 500 orchids and they're not going to get anyone high.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.380
I have over 500 orchids.

07:04.380 --> 07:09.380
No, I do have like 20 orchids and a bunch of other plants.

07:10.380 --> 07:13.380
Were you in jail because you murdered someone?

07:13.380 --> 07:15.380
Some's one, but yes.

07:15.380 --> 07:16.380
Adam's cane.

07:16.380 --> 07:19.380
The orchids bring me peace.

07:19.380 --> 07:24.380
I have like 10 full size orchids and then 10 of those are real tiny.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.380
They're little mini orchids.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.380
It's not like I'm crazy.

07:29.380 --> 07:33.380
They're actually all mine is the thing.

07:33.380 --> 07:34.380
That's the deal.

07:34.380 --> 07:35.380
That's the deal.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.380
I got some orchids.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.380
You got some orchids.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.380
I got some orchids.

07:38.380 --> 07:39.380
I got some orchids.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.380
I got some orchids.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.380
I got some orchids.

07:41.380 --> 07:42.380
Oh, you got some?

07:42.380 --> 07:43.380
I got some orchids, but I got some orchids.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.380
You got some orchids.

07:44.380 --> 07:45.380
That's the deal.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.380
That's the other deal.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.380
Luke takes care of them all.

07:47.380 --> 07:50.380
Yeah, I do all the work.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.380
Luke, I watered your orchids yesterday.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.380
Thank you.

07:54.380 --> 07:55.380
You're welcome.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.380
Luke does have two orchids.

07:57.380 --> 08:02.380
I sprayed the orchids the other day and I watered my little palm tree.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.380
That's what he calls his penis.

08:04.380 --> 08:09.380
I was in jail because I put my orchids in a bong and smoked it.

08:09.380 --> 08:13.380
Should we start the episode or should we talk about cat suck house?

08:13.380 --> 08:20.380
You begin falling upward through a technicolor swirl composed of unnatural hues your eyes

08:20.380 --> 08:25.380
cannot quite comprehend while at the same time completely dark.

08:25.380 --> 08:31.380
The nothingness is endless and you feel content physically.

08:31.380 --> 08:38.380
It's a familiar feeling, one you felt upon each of your resets in Ari Manstein's Mausoleum

08:38.380 --> 08:46.380
and above you in the direction you're weightlessly falling is nothing but the complete absence of light.

08:46.380 --> 08:54.380
Somehow both a maelstrom of overstimulation and a wholly empty void.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.380
Do we have our faculties about us?

08:56.380 --> 08:58.380
Seemingly.

08:58.380 --> 09:01.380
Completely warped, completely confused.

09:01.380 --> 09:07.380
You see that John Lee Kevin Moore the Thirth has rolled himself up into a ball

09:07.380 --> 09:10.380
and he is floating up alongside with you as is.

09:10.380 --> 09:11.380
Do they see that?

09:11.380 --> 09:12.380
Are you rolled up like a ball?

09:12.380 --> 09:14.380
I thought we couldn't see anything.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.380
Oh you can't but you can clearly see each other.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.380
That's a thing.

09:17.380 --> 09:23.380
You can't see anything but you are all seeing each other as well as this weird light around you

09:23.380 --> 09:30.380
that is the most colorful thing you've ever seen, hues you've never experienced and it's also completely pitch dark.

09:30.380 --> 09:32.380
Cool. Cool.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.380
And you're all there.

09:33.380 --> 09:34.380
And you're falling upward.

09:34.380 --> 09:35.380
Endlessly.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.380
And who else is there but Spud?

09:38.380 --> 09:41.380
I had no shit, went to middle school with a kid named Spud.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.380
Really?

09:42.380 --> 09:43.380
Yeah.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.380
Oh.

09:44.380 --> 09:50.380
This is where I should say shout out to Bip from Hebo, Oregon.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.380
Hebo?

09:51.380 --> 09:53.380
For giving us Reginald.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.380
You cut out a little bit when you said your name.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.380
Arthur McKenzie.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.380
I didn't hear it.

09:56.380 --> 09:59.380
Bip from Hebo, Oregon.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.380
I also did not hear the name again.

10:01.380 --> 10:05.380
Let's say Hebo, let's not say Hebo.

10:05.380 --> 10:11.380
That sounds like somebody just slipped a slur past us.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.380
What if the name is really Hebo though?

10:13.380 --> 10:16.380
I think it's better safe than sorry.

10:16.380 --> 10:19.380
Bet you're going to have to beep all of this out dude.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.380
Yeah.

10:22.380 --> 10:27.380
Dude, holy shit, the population of Hebo is 182.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.380
Wow.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.380
Small town.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.380
They're a small town Bip.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.380
I was born in a small town.

10:33.380 --> 10:37.380
It's not even a town, it's an unincorporated census designated place.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.380
In Tillamook County.

10:39.380 --> 10:41.380
I bet it's beautiful there.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.380
There's definitely something, this is where crazy shit would happen.

10:44.380 --> 10:49.380
Yeah, it's named after Mount Hebo, there's a Mount Hebo Air Force base.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.380
Now he's saying it.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.380
Yeah dude, come on man.

10:52.380 --> 10:57.380
Was the site of the Mount Hebo Air Force base until it closed in 1980.

10:57.380 --> 10:59.380
So haunted Air Force base.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.380
I wonder why it closed.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.380
I wonder why it closed.

11:02.380 --> 11:06.380
Find out on the next arc of our Patreon Delta Green game.

11:06.380 --> 11:14.380
Guys, did you know 7.4% of the population there is 18 to 24.

11:14.380 --> 11:16.380
Do you guys want to clap in to reset yourselves?

11:16.380 --> 11:17.380
Sure.

11:17.380 --> 11:22.380
Zach, have you fucking started having your classes of six year olds clap in to calm them

11:22.380 --> 11:23.380
down?

11:23.380 --> 11:26.380
No, do you guys want to sing what I sing?

11:26.380 --> 11:28.380
Everyone's sitting nicely.

11:28.380 --> 11:32.380
Everyone's sitting nicely.

11:32.380 --> 11:33.380
Thank you.

11:33.380 --> 11:37.380
And then I go around and I tell them each good job with their name and I give them a

11:37.380 --> 11:38.380
high five and a low five.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.380
Okay, but yeah, can you fucking resolve that melody though?

11:42.380 --> 11:43.380
Nope.

11:43.380 --> 11:47.380
So as you guys are literally falling upwards.

11:47.380 --> 11:52.380
Keith is kind of content because he knows it's not actually happening to him.

11:52.380 --> 11:54.380
You feel very physically content.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.380
Physical distance wise, can I move?

11:56.380 --> 12:00.380
Am I able to get closer to anybody in any way?

12:00.380 --> 12:04.380
Oh yeah, and like the minute you get closer you're super far away from them and then you're

12:04.380 --> 12:05.380
right next to them.

12:05.380 --> 12:07.380
It's all kind of happening at the same time.

12:07.380 --> 12:12.380
You're very much moving wherever you want to and further away.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.380
That's cool.

12:13.380 --> 12:19.380
The disconnect between the physical contentment he feels, the breakdown between his mind and

12:19.380 --> 12:27.380
his body, not to mention the time and spatial anomalies means John Lee Pettymore just barfs

12:27.380 --> 12:29.380
into this blackness.

12:29.380 --> 12:34.380
All of a sudden the barf that is floating into this void turns the same color that you're

12:34.380 --> 12:41.380
seeing all around this, which is this insane inky black darkness that is coming out of

12:41.380 --> 12:42.380
you and the rest of you see it too.

12:42.380 --> 12:48.380
It's the ooze that's coming out of John Lee Kevin Moore, the thirst mouth as he vomits,

12:48.380 --> 12:54.380
but the ooze is like lighting up with sparks of this unnatural color that is just like

12:54.380 --> 12:56.380
abreasting your eyes.

12:56.380 --> 13:01.380
You have no idea how to handle this and your brain is essentially just like fucking melting

13:01.380 --> 13:06.380
because it is just a complete overstimulation and at the same time physically you feel more

13:06.380 --> 13:12.380
calm than you ever have in your life, maybe next to the time that you were commanded to

13:12.380 --> 13:17.380
feel calm by that giant, gaunt, translucent skinned man.

13:17.380 --> 13:22.380
God damn it, that fucking Uber driver was one of them things.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.380
Whoa!

13:24.380 --> 13:27.380
He says as he floats in and out of your view simultaneously.

13:27.380 --> 13:28.380
Oh, well maybe not.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.380
Hey, hey man.

13:30.380 --> 13:35.380
You see that his pants are made out of a similar patchy material with all the clothes and you've

13:35.380 --> 13:39.380
brought this character with you into the next part of the story.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.380
Whoa, dude.

13:41.380 --> 13:42.380
Fuck.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.380
Is he laughing like that?

13:43.380 --> 13:44.380
Yeah.

13:44.380 --> 13:45.380
Is he feeling good about it?

13:45.380 --> 13:46.380
Shit.

13:46.380 --> 13:47.380
Yeah, dude.

13:47.380 --> 13:48.380
Oh, man.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.380
Why are you saying he though?

13:50.380 --> 13:51.380
It's weird, man.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.380
Is he feeling weird about it?

13:53.380 --> 13:57.380
And he points at you and as he's pointing at you, you see that he's pointing at Keith

13:57.380 --> 14:00.380
and he's pointing at John at the same time and he's kind of pointing at himself with

14:00.380 --> 14:04.380
four fingers because that's what happens when you point a finger and he's like, dude,

14:04.380 --> 14:05.380
dude.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.380
What?

14:06.380 --> 14:11.380
You see John looking at his fingers as he's pointing and he's like, holy shit, that's

14:11.380 --> 14:14.380
right.

14:14.380 --> 14:19.380
Except it's only three fingers that point back, not four.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.380
It's true.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.380
No, there's a fourth finger and there's not.

14:23.380 --> 14:30.380
Keith reaches up to buckle his seatbelt and is concerned when it's not there.

14:30.380 --> 14:31.380
It's not.

14:31.380 --> 14:37.380
And as your hand reaches out, there's like a trail behind it of this color, like a like

14:37.380 --> 14:40.380
tracer, like on the back of a bullet in a video game or something.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.380
I don't know if that happens in real life.

14:42.380 --> 14:45.380
I've never seen a bullet moving or not moving.

14:45.380 --> 14:50.380
And as your hand moves, it's just like this crazy color scheme is just like failing behind

14:50.380 --> 14:51.380
it.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.380
Like you just won solitaire.

14:52.380 --> 14:57.380
Thomas, you're going to say something about bullets?

14:57.380 --> 14:58.380
Yeah.

14:58.380 --> 15:08.380
Tracer, tracers happen when you have tracer rounds, which are bullets that are specially

15:08.380 --> 15:12.380
designed to have a chem trail, have a chem trail.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.380
Is that what's doing it?

15:14.380 --> 15:15.380
Yeah.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.380
Yeah.

15:16.380 --> 15:21.380
You all see a series of scenes play out around you, the subjects in settings, like a hologram

15:21.380 --> 15:25.380
made of the same unnatural light.

15:25.380 --> 15:31.380
First, you see the sanctuary of the first church of contention decorated for a funeral.

15:31.380 --> 15:37.380
Two coffins are closed up in front of the lectern with pictures of the deceased burn

15:37.380 --> 15:40.380
victims on either side.

15:40.380 --> 15:47.380
Adam Cain's parents looked happy in their wedding photo, but somehow even more joyful

15:47.380 --> 15:53.380
in a JCPenney photo shoot with a smiling, toothless baby Adam Cain.

15:53.380 --> 15:59.380
The orphaned boy with black eyes and a balloon head sneaks slowly out of a conversation with

15:59.380 --> 16:03.380
extended relatives before running quickly for a closet door.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.380
He does not, however, find the solace he seeks.

16:06.380 --> 16:13.380
Rather, he finds himself in this small, dark space cluttered with old hymnals and extra

16:13.380 --> 16:16.380
candles, one of which is lit.

16:16.380 --> 16:21.380
And the orange light illuminates the face of a crazed, heartbroken Clark Bishop.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.380
Nice.

16:22.380 --> 16:29.380
He is not much older than he is here in this vacuum seemingly outside both time and space.

16:29.380 --> 16:36.380
Clark reaches out and tucks a note into the inside pocket of Adam Cain's blazer previously

16:36.380 --> 16:40.380
only worn on Easter and Christmas Sunday.

16:40.380 --> 16:43.380
The closet suddenly goes dark.

16:43.380 --> 16:48.380
The balloon-headed boy pulls the metal chain attached to the singular bulb above and finds

16:48.380 --> 16:52.380
himself alone with the spare songbooks and vigil lights.

16:52.380 --> 16:58.380
He pulls out the note, unfolds it, and you all see a list of directions.

16:58.380 --> 17:04.380
Underlined at the top is the sentence, one day, years from now, it will be imperative

17:04.380 --> 17:10.380
that you replace Keith Vigna as Silas Cole, the founder of contention.

17:10.380 --> 17:16.380
Step one outlines where to find and how to use the strange helmet Cain eventually bought

17:16.380 --> 17:17.380
at Forgotten Treasures.

17:17.380 --> 17:23.380
Step two includes an incantation that claims to change the shape of water.

17:23.380 --> 17:30.380
Step three discusses the properties of the ooze and its relationship with fish and fish-filled

17:30.380 --> 17:31.380
water.

17:31.380 --> 17:37.380
Finally, at the bottom, it simply reads, I'm real sorry about your family.

17:37.380 --> 17:38.380
That's crazy.

17:38.380 --> 17:42.380
You don't want to change the shape of water because that film was very of its moment and

17:42.380 --> 17:45.380
obviously it won the awards it won because of that.

17:45.380 --> 17:50.380
And I think if you mess with that formula, it's just not going to be the same.

17:50.380 --> 17:54.380
I mean, obviously it doesn't necessarily hold up to a lot of scrutiny, but come on, you

17:54.380 --> 17:55.380
know.

17:55.380 --> 17:57.380
The set design was just delightful.

17:57.380 --> 18:00.380
Other than that, that's insane.

18:00.380 --> 18:05.380
Literally, John Lee, Kevin Moore III, Clark Bishop, and Keith Vigna, seemingly as well

18:05.380 --> 18:09.380
as this other man, Spud, witnessed this.

18:09.380 --> 18:14.380
Are we physically seeing a scene play out before us in those moments or is it something

18:14.380 --> 18:15.380
that's happening internally with us?

18:15.380 --> 18:17.380
Oh no, it's external.

18:17.380 --> 18:20.380
You can kind of see each other through and around it as well.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.380
At the same time, you can't.

18:21.380 --> 18:24.380
You're very much standing in that closet with them.

18:24.380 --> 18:29.380
But you're also falling upward through this fucking bifrost.

18:29.380 --> 18:30.380
Bifrost?

18:30.380 --> 18:31.380
Yeah.

18:31.380 --> 18:35.380
What does that mean?

18:35.380 --> 18:38.380
Yeah, tell us more about that.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.380
Where did you just let slip out?

18:39.380 --> 18:41.380
It's just what that thing is.

18:41.380 --> 18:42.380
It's a Thor thing.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.380
The bifrost is how they get around.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.380
Damn it.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.380
It's a nerd.

18:45.380 --> 18:46.380
Mythology.

18:46.380 --> 18:47.380
It's a nerd thing?

18:47.380 --> 18:48.380
No, it's not nerdy.

18:48.380 --> 18:50.380
It's Norse mythology.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.380
Is it?

18:53.380 --> 18:54.380
It's pronounced bifrost.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.380
Yeah, it is.

18:55.380 --> 19:00.380
Bifrost is the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard with Midgard.

19:00.380 --> 19:01.380
Duh.

19:01.380 --> 19:02.380
It's real.

19:02.380 --> 19:03.380
That's amazing.

19:03.380 --> 19:04.380
I thought you were talking about something.

19:04.380 --> 19:05.380
Wait, it's actually real?

19:05.380 --> 19:06.380
It's real.

19:06.380 --> 19:11.380
I thought we were talking about some bullshit that's fake.

19:12.380 --> 19:17.380
I just meant that it's actual Norse mythology, not some Marvel shit.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.380
So it's called beef roast?

19:19.380 --> 19:21.380
It's called bifroast?

19:21.380 --> 19:22.380
Beef roast.

19:22.380 --> 19:23.380
Like Arby's.

19:23.380 --> 19:25.380
Beef roast.

19:25.380 --> 19:32.380
And as you're in this beef roast, just crock potting away, you do see, you're still looking

19:32.380 --> 19:37.380
at this letter that says, I'm real sorry about your family.

19:37.380 --> 19:45.380
The letters of the word family morph into the city skyline, but an out of place, massive

19:45.380 --> 19:50.380
circle is moving quickly up toward the top of one of the tallest buildings.

19:50.380 --> 19:56.380
Your view approaches in time to catch planet juggernaut with its two wild eyed partners

19:56.380 --> 20:02.380
in tow, fling itself from the towering high rise, reach out with its powerful hands and

20:02.380 --> 20:08.380
slam two helicopters together like a kid playing recklessly with sturdy toys.

20:08.380 --> 20:15.380
Instantly, this wily child dons a helicopter hat as blades begin chopping the air above

20:15.380 --> 20:22.380
the gigantic ball that lifts into the sky and slowly disappears into the horizon.

20:22.380 --> 20:29.380
Your view zooms into the distance until it is engulfed in an ivory endlessness before

20:29.380 --> 20:36.380
the experienced hand of one Vanna White touches it gently and a letter appears.

20:36.380 --> 20:43.380
You all see John Lee Kevinmore, the third laying lazily, lying lazily on Clark's couch,

20:43.380 --> 20:46.380
absolutely crushing wheel of fortune.

20:46.380 --> 20:53.380
And then in the distance, fast approaching, you hear the whir of helicopter blades as

20:53.380 --> 21:00.380
something massive and round blocks out the sun that previously poured into the windows

21:00.380 --> 21:03.380
of the Bishop house.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.380
Holy shit.

21:05.380 --> 21:12.380
If we were to like reach out and try to interact with this, what happens?

21:12.380 --> 21:16.380
Your hand kind of moves through it and does the same like tracer thing where it's just

21:16.380 --> 21:21.380
like multiple versions of your hand are seen moving through it and the color displaces

21:21.380 --> 21:23.380
and replaces and it's next to you.

21:23.380 --> 21:24.380
It's behind you.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.380
It's through you.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.380
You're inside of it.

21:26.380 --> 21:31.380
If you looked over at him, you would see John weeping, but it does seem like big, warm,

21:31.380 --> 21:32.380
happy tears.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.380
What is the puzzle?

21:34.380 --> 21:35.380
What is the puzzle?

21:35.380 --> 21:37.380
Like what is the word?

21:37.380 --> 21:44.380
Um, yeah, the, um, the puzzle is, um, meet me in St. Louis Armstrong.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.380
That's a good one.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.380
Nice way to pull that out.

21:49.380 --> 21:54.380
This guy is like in there with you and he's like, whoa, is that you?

21:54.380 --> 21:57.380
And he's like looking at both of you as, as this happens.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.380
He's like, what the fuck?

21:59.380 --> 22:05.380
John wipes the tear from his eyes and he's like, it was, it might be again.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.380
I think it's a version of us.

22:07.380 --> 22:11.380
I think it is an us that was, it's not now we're, we're here, right?

22:11.380 --> 22:14.380
And I try and touch somebody, whoever's nearest.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.380
Can I put, can I make contact with someone?

22:16.380 --> 22:20.380
I also am reaching out to touch spud and see if he's real.

22:20.380 --> 22:25.380
You both absolutely feel real physical contact and as well, your hand moves through them

22:25.380 --> 22:27.380
completely, but it's also very real.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.380
So fucking cool.

22:29.380 --> 22:31.380
It is, but it's not.

22:31.380 --> 22:34.380
And then at the same time is.

22:36.380 --> 22:40.380
Does his pillowy touch bring bud to an ivory andlessness?

22:40.380 --> 22:42.380
Spud.

22:43.380 --> 22:44.380
Yeah.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.380
And no.

22:48.380 --> 22:51.380
In case you said velvety for Vanna White.

22:51.380 --> 22:53.380
Here's a line reading of me saying velvety.

22:53.380 --> 22:54.380
Velvety?

22:54.380 --> 22:56.380
I didn't, but that was good.

22:56.380 --> 22:57.380
Punch that in.

22:57.380 --> 22:59.380
What did you say?

22:59.380 --> 23:01.380
Experienced hand.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.380
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

23:03.380 --> 23:05.380
Shut the fuck up.

23:07.380 --> 23:11.380
Does his experienced hand bring him to an ivory andlessness?

23:15.380 --> 23:23.380
Dude, an experienced hand has brought me to an ivory andlessness so many times.

23:30.380 --> 23:31.380
Oh my God.

23:31.380 --> 23:32.380
Oh man.

23:33.380 --> 23:34.380
Oh fuck.

23:37.380 --> 23:39.380
The shadows cast by the imminent.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.380
Oh, sorry.

23:40.380 --> 23:45.380
Keith pulls his phone out to see like on the Uber app, like where he is.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.380
You're like 2.2 now?

23:50.380 --> 23:54.380
No, I'm at like physically the location of where he is.

23:54.380 --> 23:56.380
You can see it dropping.

23:57.380 --> 24:00.380
Yeah, he's like rating you on his phone.

24:00.380 --> 24:04.380
He's like, this is the craziest Uber ride.

24:04.380 --> 24:08.380
Not the most charismatic partner through eternity.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.380
So far.

24:10.380 --> 24:12.380
Where does it say we are though?

24:12.380 --> 24:13.380
Oh, your phone.

24:13.380 --> 24:17.380
When you look at your phone, you see your reflection is Silas Cole.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.380
Oh shit.

24:19.380 --> 24:20.380
Fuck yeah.

24:22.380 --> 24:23.380
Guys, what do I look like?

24:23.380 --> 24:24.380
I look at him.

24:24.380 --> 24:29.380
He's wearing stupid shorts and a stupid shirt and he looks like his stupid fucking self.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.380
You look like your stupid fucking self, Keith.

24:31.380 --> 24:36.380
Look, and I show him my phone trying to show him my reflection.

24:36.380 --> 24:41.380
You see an old grizzled version of yourself wearing a hood over the top as the overseer

24:41.380 --> 24:45.380
that you've seen so many times and a light begins beaming out of your face.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.380
What do I look like?

24:46.380 --> 24:47.380
What do I look like?

24:47.380 --> 24:48.380
And I start feeling my own head.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.380
You look like you.

24:49.380 --> 24:51.380
What do I look like in Keith's magic phone?

24:51.380 --> 24:55.380
I show my magic phone to John Lee Pettymore.

24:55.380 --> 24:56.380
You don't see anything.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.380
He peers deeply, yeah.

24:58.380 --> 25:03.380
His eyes are bulgy and he's trying so hard to see something in the phone screen.

25:03.380 --> 25:08.380
It eventually zooms out to encapsulate all of Planet Juggernaut.

25:08.380 --> 25:13.380
John Lee Pettymore experiences a high freehandlessness.

25:16.380 --> 25:19.380
I want to show the phone to Spud and see what he sees.

25:19.380 --> 25:22.380
What?

25:22.380 --> 25:23.380
What do you see, man?

25:23.380 --> 25:26.380
Dude, it's me.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.380
That's nuts.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.380
You look about like you expected.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.380
I mean, who are we really?

25:33.380 --> 25:39.380
Sometimes I just like stand in the mirror and stare for as long as I can until my eyes

25:39.380 --> 25:43.380
are the only thing I can really see and the rest just kind of fades away.

25:43.380 --> 25:48.380
And then I slowly move my head back and forth from side to side but try to keep my eyes

25:48.380 --> 25:50.380
in like the same spot.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.380
It's fucking crazy, man.

25:52.380 --> 25:55.380
Alright Spud, we'll check back in with you later.

25:55.380 --> 26:03.380
The shadows cast by the imminent Planet Juggernaut form a thick metal blast door in a dank, dimly

26:03.380 --> 26:06.380
lit subterranean laboratory.

26:06.380 --> 26:12.380
Keith Vigna stands on the outside wearing clothes that fit in around 1880-something

26:12.380 --> 26:18.380
and jots in a notebook as he looks through a porthole where you all see Tildy B. Mitchell's

26:18.380 --> 26:21.380
body convulsing on the floor.

26:21.380 --> 26:27.380
Her leg is stabbing into the cement ground rhythmically as it turns into a piece of machinery

26:27.380 --> 26:31.380
on a beautiful sunny day at the Contention Mining Company.

26:31.380 --> 26:38.380
As Keith Beans walks past his workers and into his office, he's met with hearty greetings.

26:38.380 --> 26:39.380
Good day, boss.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.380
How do you do, sir?

26:40.380 --> 26:42.380
Take care, Mr. Cole.

26:42.380 --> 26:49.380
You watch as the physique changes around the mouth making the greeting and see a rotund,

26:49.380 --> 26:55.380
sweat-covered man finish the previous thought like a before and after on Wheel of Fortune

26:55.380 --> 26:57.380
as he says,

26:59.380 --> 27:02.380
Mr. Cole needs to be taken care of.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.380
Fucking impeccable.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.380
That's an artist right there.

27:07.380 --> 27:09.380
That's a professional artist right there.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.380
Oh, it's like, it feels bad.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.380
It hurts.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.380
Did you hear that?

27:13.380 --> 27:14.380
Oh, my God.

27:14.380 --> 27:15.380
Some of it came back out.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.380
It was so gurgly.

27:16.380 --> 27:17.380
I think you need to wipe.

27:17.380 --> 27:20.380
I literally had spindrift in my mouth on that burp.

27:20.380 --> 27:21.380
Oh, God.

27:21.380 --> 27:24.380
I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.380
It sounds like you aspirated some spindrift.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.380
Oh, my God.

27:28.380 --> 27:33.380
I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.380
It sounds like you aspirated some spindrift.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.380
Oh, my God.

27:37.380 --> 27:41.380
I'm so glad you didn't just puke onto your microphone just now.

27:42.380 --> 27:46.380
Did you go to jail for murdering some 41?

27:46.380 --> 27:48.380
Some's 41.

27:48.380 --> 27:51.380
Some 41 told me.

27:52.380 --> 27:54.380
Okay, you guys want to keep going?

27:54.380 --> 27:58.380
Yeah, I'm waiting for something to, you know,

27:58.380 --> 28:00.380
I mean, not that stuff isn't happening,

28:00.380 --> 28:03.380
but I'm waiting for, like, to be able to do something.

28:03.380 --> 28:06.380
I'm waiting for you to wow me.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.380
I want to, like, because I'm just,

28:09.380 --> 28:12.380
we're just flailing and floating right now, you know?

28:12.380 --> 28:13.380
Yeah, it's an audio podcast.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.380
You can always talk to each other.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.380
Nah.

28:16.380 --> 28:18.380
This is crazy.

28:21.380 --> 28:24.380
So, wait, is the Silas Cole flashback,

28:24.380 --> 28:26.380
it ends with Ephraim saying that?

28:26.380 --> 28:27.380
That's the end of that?

28:27.380 --> 28:28.380
Nope, I'm in the middle of it.

28:28.380 --> 28:29.380
That's what I thought.

28:29.380 --> 28:30.380
Okay.

28:30.380 --> 28:31.380
Finish out your phone.

28:31.380 --> 28:33.380
I mean, we've all been, we've all been real silly,

28:33.380 --> 28:36.380
but Judge Ephraim Courtland was anything but.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.380
This meeting he had called was about to decide

28:38.380 --> 28:41.380
if they, the elders of contention,

28:41.380 --> 28:45.380
should hire this roaming cowboy, Cornelius Beans,

28:45.380 --> 28:49.380
to dispose of their town's paranoid figurehead.

28:49.380 --> 28:52.380
All in attendance were in favor and said aye.

28:52.380 --> 28:56.380
The judge excused himself to fetch this mercenary for hire

28:56.380 --> 28:58.380
who just happened to be in town for the day,

28:58.380 --> 29:02.380
and Cornelius Beans later entered the secret meeting

29:02.380 --> 29:04.380
to spit and shake on the deal.

29:04.380 --> 29:08.380
The handshake transforms into a live hand grasping

29:08.380 --> 29:12.380
the cold, limp grip of a body that drapes

29:12.380 --> 29:15.380
like a frequently worn sweater in a closet.

29:15.380 --> 29:18.380
This closet, however, is down in a crawl space

29:18.380 --> 29:21.380
six feet deep with dirt floors.

29:21.380 --> 29:25.380
It smells heavily like rich earth and cedar,

29:25.380 --> 29:29.380
and there are rows of other long hanging cadavers

29:29.380 --> 29:31.380
suspended from the supports.

29:31.380 --> 29:35.380
A small metal ball with long metal tendrils

29:35.380 --> 29:40.380
excuses itself from the beans-dubbed cowboy shell

29:40.380 --> 29:44.380
it inhabited and enters its familiar host,

29:44.380 --> 29:48.380
known to the town of contention as Mary Cole.

29:48.380 --> 29:52.380
She walks up the dusty wooden stairs, enters the house,

29:52.380 --> 29:55.380
and begins to chant an incantation she remembers

29:55.380 --> 29:58.380
from her maker's lips.

29:59.380 --> 30:03.380
A swirling hole opens in the ground,

30:03.380 --> 30:07.380
and Keith Beans wakes up from a deep sleep,

30:07.380 --> 30:11.380
eyes wide and horrified, as Mary Cole,

30:11.380 --> 30:14.380
this woman standing in his bedroom

30:14.380 --> 30:16.380
with old timey clothing on,

30:16.380 --> 30:21.380
throws her creator into the eternal portal,

30:21.380 --> 30:23.380
filling the bedroom floor.

30:23.380 --> 30:26.380
And then, as you're falling upward,

30:26.380 --> 30:31.380
your vision fades, and the light refocuses

30:31.380 --> 30:34.380
on the three of you.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.380
Holy shit.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.380
Hey, Luke, you remember the first dream you had

30:38.380 --> 30:40.380
as Keith Vigna?

30:40.380 --> 30:43.380
You were still dreaming, but you woke up in your bed

30:43.380 --> 30:45.380
and you saw a woman in your time in clothing.

30:45.380 --> 30:46.380
Oh, yes, yes.

30:46.380 --> 30:48.380
Threw me through the floor.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.380
Oh.

30:50.380 --> 30:53.380
Oh.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.380
That's fucking incredible, dude.

30:55.380 --> 30:58.380
That's wild.

30:58.380 --> 31:00.380
Who was it?

31:05.380 --> 31:07.380
Damn, dude, that was so long ago.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.380
Holy shit.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.380
Jesus, dude.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.380
That's just really cool.

31:13.380 --> 31:15.380
Did you all saw?

31:15.380 --> 31:17.380
There was a ball.

31:17.380 --> 31:19.380
It had tendrils.

31:19.380 --> 31:21.380
It's one of the balls, right?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.380
You guys saw that, right?

31:24.380 --> 31:27.380
John just rolls his eyes like,

31:27.380 --> 31:29.380
duh, it was a ball.

31:29.380 --> 31:32.380
Keith is having just flashbacks to that dream

31:32.380 --> 31:35.380
and trying to piece things together in his mind,

31:35.380 --> 31:39.380
but also he still isn't fully convinced

31:39.380 --> 31:42.380
that any of this is actually happening to him.

31:42.380 --> 31:46.380
Keith, the stuff that I saw,

31:46.380 --> 31:49.380
it wasn't something I remember, per se,

31:49.380 --> 31:52.380
but it all kind of touched on things

31:52.380 --> 31:55.380
that I could understand being a thing.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.380
What you just saw, was that anything

31:57.380 --> 31:59.380
that rings a bell for you?

31:59.380 --> 32:02.380
Did you see anything that rings true?

32:02.380 --> 32:07.380
I had a dream and she was there.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.380
She was there.

32:09.380 --> 32:11.380
I had a dream and she was there.

32:11.380 --> 32:15.380
I think it's M-A-R-Y.

32:15.380 --> 32:18.380
What does that stand for again, Keith?

32:18.380 --> 32:25.380
Oh, that stands for...

32:25.380 --> 32:28.380
Marvin's Awesome Robots, y'all.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.380
It was something like,

32:32.380 --> 32:38.380
Y was the version of it, and it's M-A-R.

32:38.380 --> 32:41.380
Manipulating Activator Robot.

32:41.380 --> 32:44.380
Yeah, version Y.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.380
Marvy.

32:46.380 --> 32:48.380
Marvy, Marx.

32:48.380 --> 32:51.380
Marvy, Mars, Marx.

32:51.380 --> 32:55.380
A lot of these were cooler than Mary.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.380
Seemingly out of nowhere,

32:57.380 --> 32:59.380
you're all sitting on the ground.

32:59.380 --> 33:01.380
Above you is pure darkness,

33:01.380 --> 33:04.380
the same darkness you've seen above you this whole time,

33:04.380 --> 33:09.380
and beneath you, the ground is made of pure light.

33:09.380 --> 33:13.380
But as your eyes adjust to your new surroundings,

33:13.380 --> 33:16.380
the endlessness of it all begins to fade away,

33:16.380 --> 33:21.380
and you see you're actually all sitting on the ground in a small room.

33:21.380 --> 33:25.380
It feels smaller due to the amount of junk accumulated around you,

33:25.380 --> 33:28.380
like a hoarder studio apartment.

33:28.380 --> 33:32.380
And you hear a whiny moan,

33:32.380 --> 33:37.380
pained from behind a jostling pile of clutter.

33:37.380 --> 33:44.380
Who's there? Who's there?

33:44.380 --> 33:47.380
Leo?

33:47.380 --> 33:49.380
Who knows me? Who is that?

33:49.380 --> 33:51.380
Is it Leo?

33:51.380 --> 33:53.380
It's Clark. Leo, it's Clark.

33:53.380 --> 33:56.380
Clark Bishop, you motherfucker.

33:56.380 --> 34:02.380
And this jostling amount of junk just falls over,

34:02.380 --> 34:04.380
pours over onto the ground,

34:04.380 --> 34:07.380
the real ground now below you that is still made of light,

34:07.380 --> 34:11.380
and it falls over, and he falls toward you,

34:11.380 --> 34:14.380
and you see as he falls on his face in front of you,

34:14.380 --> 34:16.380
it is very clearly Leo Piston.

34:16.380 --> 34:21.380
He looks exactly like he did the night that he stood atop the two-fanged plunge,

34:21.380 --> 34:25.380
and a bullet was fired through his body by Julie Maxwell,

34:25.380 --> 34:27.380
who then you shot in the eye.

34:27.380 --> 34:30.380
And as he falls forward, you do see he's shirtless,

34:30.380 --> 34:34.380
and the skin kind of like falls and hits the ground below,

34:34.380 --> 34:39.380
and the fat on his sides kind of presses against all the junk

34:39.380 --> 34:41.380
that is down there next to him,

34:41.380 --> 34:45.380
and you see a very clear exit wound from where,

34:45.380 --> 34:50.380
or an entrance wound from where the bullet went through him,

34:50.380 --> 34:51.380
and he's like,

34:51.380 --> 35:00.380
Oh, I'm in so much pain, and this is all you felt.

35:00.380 --> 35:05.380
Oh, dammit, it's sixth-cent style ghosts.

35:05.380 --> 35:09.380
I'm no ghost.

35:09.380 --> 35:11.380
I didn't hear what he said.

35:11.380 --> 35:12.380
It kind of cut out.

35:12.380 --> 35:15.380
I'm no ghost.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.380
Oh.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.380
You're not real.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.380
You're not real.

35:20.380 --> 35:22.380
It fucking hurts.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.380
It still hurts.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.380
I turned to the guys.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.380
This can't be real.

35:27.380 --> 35:28.380
He's dead.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.380
He's dead.

35:29.380 --> 35:30.380
He's dead.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.380
We saw his body slide down the slide.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.380
Well, yeah, and now we're probably dead, too,

35:34.380 --> 35:36.380
because we suffocated news,

35:36.380 --> 35:41.380
and we're up here in sixth-cent ghost hell with Leo.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.380
His body got caught by the goo.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.380
Yeah, just like us.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.380
The goo got him.

35:46.380 --> 35:48.380
It slammed him in the ground, didn't it?

35:48.380 --> 35:49.380
Oh, yeah.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.380
It fucking hurt, too.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.380
It slammed me in the ground so many times.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.380
I've been in your unconscious for a while,

35:54.380 --> 35:55.380
and you'll have it in.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.380
Well, about five days, Leo, I think.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.380
I was going to say, how long has it been?

35:59.380 --> 36:00.380
Two and a half years?

36:00.380 --> 36:05.380
It feels like forever since you've been gone.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.380
Please come back home.

36:07.380 --> 36:11.380
Has anybody ever told you you kind of sound like Adam Sandler

36:11.380 --> 36:13.380
at his worst impulses?

36:13.380 --> 36:16.380
Eh.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.380
Heh.

36:18.380 --> 36:20.380
Does Adam Sandler exist in this universe?

36:20.380 --> 36:23.380
John Lee Pennymore doesn't want to exist in a universe

36:23.380 --> 36:25.380
that Adam Sandler doesn't.

36:25.380 --> 36:32.380
Ha ha ha!

36:32.380 --> 36:36.380
Clark is going to have a look of dawning realization.

36:36.380 --> 36:38.380
He starts looking around.

36:38.380 --> 36:40.380
Does that mean, is she here?

36:40.380 --> 36:43.380
Leo, is Julie here?

36:43.380 --> 36:44.380
Eh.

36:44.380 --> 36:46.380
Julie was dead.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.380
My body was here.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.380
My body was here.

36:50.380 --> 36:55.380
And he points to the ground nearby,

36:55.380 --> 36:56.380
and there's no body.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.380
And his eyes get huge.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.380
And he's like, Jesus.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.380
She was there.

37:00.380 --> 37:06.380
And then, as fuck you not, this little metal ball

37:06.380 --> 37:10.380
fell down the same way you guys just did.

37:10.380 --> 37:15.380
And this little spider worm arms climbed up into her face.

37:16.380 --> 37:20.380
And she stood up out of nowhere.

37:20.380 --> 37:26.380
And this black ooze started pouring out of her eyeball.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.380
Well, you shot her.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.380
Meh.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.380
Just darkness pouring out of her eye.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.380
And then what, Leo?

37:34.380 --> 37:35.380
Where'd she go?

37:35.380 --> 37:38.380
And he points at a large metal door.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.380
Like a hatch.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.380
Are there any windows in the room we're in?

37:42.380 --> 37:43.380
No.

37:43.380 --> 37:49.380
Is this the same room that I was in in the pond?

37:49.380 --> 37:50.380
Nope.

37:50.380 --> 37:52.380
And are we saying hatch because it's on the ground?

37:52.380 --> 37:54.380
No, sorry.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.380
It's on the wall like a door.

37:56.380 --> 37:58.380
I don't know why I'm saying hatch.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.380
I think it's just like the big rectangle.

38:00.380 --> 38:03.380
It actually looks like a walk-in freezer, I guess.

38:03.380 --> 38:04.380
Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

38:04.380 --> 38:05.380
Gotcha, yeah.

38:05.380 --> 38:06.380
That kind of thing.

38:06.380 --> 38:09.380
Sorry, I'm just really bad with words.

38:09.380 --> 38:12.380
Yeah, you're pretty much known for that.

38:12.380 --> 38:16.380
Just control the story and the imagery.

38:16.380 --> 38:18.380
That's fine.

38:22.380 --> 38:25.380
I'm going to ship you a dictionary.

38:25.380 --> 38:28.380
I'm glad you finished that last word.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.380
I'm going to show you my dick.

38:30.380 --> 38:33.380
Me too, yeah.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.380
I'll show you a hard wire.

38:35.380 --> 38:37.380
Oh my god.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.380
Dude, fucking, okay, Harry Potter pornography Hagrid.

38:41.380 --> 38:45.380
I'm going to show you my dictionary.

38:45.380 --> 38:46.380
Nice.

38:46.380 --> 38:49.380
And then he pronounces everything very, very well.

38:49.380 --> 38:52.380
Yeah, it's not porn, it's just a lesson.

38:52.380 --> 38:54.380
It's a public speaking lesson?

38:54.380 --> 38:55.380
A sex lesson.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.380
It is porn.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.380
Hagrid porn.

38:59.380 --> 39:03.380
So Leo here says that Julie was dead.

39:03.380 --> 39:08.380
So I was under the assumption that we were in some sort of afterlife here, but maybe

39:08.380 --> 39:09.380
that's not the case.

39:09.380 --> 39:14.380
Maybe when she shot Leo, it was not a fatal wound.

39:14.380 --> 39:16.380
It was the goo that got him.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.380
It wasn't, not fatal.

39:19.380 --> 39:26.380
Do you think the goo arrested his, would he have died from his wound if he was still in

39:26.380 --> 39:27.380
the real world?

39:27.380 --> 39:29.380
Maybe time passes differently here.

39:29.380 --> 39:31.380
I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

39:31.380 --> 39:32.380
That's surprising.

39:32.380 --> 39:35.380
I've got thirty first aid, could I tell?

39:35.380 --> 39:38.380
If it would have been a fatal wound five days ago.

39:38.380 --> 39:44.380
Thinking back to five days ago, really though, a lot longer ago than five days ago, I'd

39:44.380 --> 39:46.380
imagine, in your fucked up brain.

39:46.380 --> 39:47.380
Oh, sure.

39:47.380 --> 39:51.380
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

39:51.380 --> 39:52.380
I fail.

39:52.380 --> 39:54.380
Forty-one on a thirty.

39:54.380 --> 39:57.380
Yeah, you're not, you're not sure.

39:57.380 --> 39:58.380
Certainly not sure.

39:58.380 --> 40:02.380
You're about as sure as Joe would be either way on whether or not that wound would be

40:02.380 --> 40:03.380
fatal.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.380
Yep, yep, yep.

40:04.380 --> 40:08.380
And then is, is freezer door hatch the only door in this room?

40:08.380 --> 40:11.380
The only way we would be able to get in or out?

40:11.380 --> 40:13.380
No, looking now, there's two of them.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.380
One on either side of the room.

40:15.380 --> 40:21.380
As you're talking, you saw like at Leo, Leo's literally just like crawling around knocking

40:21.380 --> 40:27.380
shit over, and he knocks over enough clutter on the opposite side of the room to reveal

40:27.380 --> 40:31.380
a second door that was unseen previous.

40:31.380 --> 40:36.380
Cause he's literally, you're looking into the eyes of a man who is feeling a fatal wound

40:36.380 --> 40:40.380
constantly, and he's just crying out in pain the whole time.

40:40.380 --> 40:48.380
I, I'm not going to keep doing it, but his wheezing, his like moaning, his is literally

40:48.380 --> 40:50.380
happening constantly.

40:50.380 --> 40:53.380
It's honestly pretty relaxing.

40:53.380 --> 40:57.380
So you're not like a dedicated enough actor to keep doing it?

40:57.380 --> 40:58.380
Sorry.

41:01.380 --> 41:10.380
Guys, now, see, now I believe that this fellow is in pain.

41:10.380 --> 41:15.380
This is a man having a hard time and that, that comes across.

41:15.380 --> 41:21.380
Should, should we put him out of his misery?

41:21.380 --> 41:23.380
Uh, no, no.

41:23.380 --> 41:29.380
He's, he's the only one that seems to have any knowledge about what's going on here.

41:29.380 --> 41:30.380
However little it may be.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.380
I don't think we should get rid of him at least, at least yet.

41:32.380 --> 41:33.380
Yeah.

41:33.380 --> 41:35.380
He's got a decent frame of reference for right now.

41:35.380 --> 41:38.380
And also it's, he is being kept alive in here.

41:38.380 --> 41:47.380
And even though he's been going through unspeakable pain for five whole days, we, we could probably

41:47.380 --> 41:48.380
get him out of here.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.380
Keith says nothing, but isn't so sure.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.380
Well, God damn it, Keith.

41:53.380 --> 41:58.380
I can tell that you're, you're not, you're not saying anything, but you're thinking something

41:58.380 --> 42:01.380
that you're, you're afraid to say, well, I'm not afraid to say it.

42:01.380 --> 42:07.380
You think we can't get out of here, but if you fucking believe that, then what is, what

42:07.380 --> 42:08.380
is any of this for?

42:08.380 --> 42:14.380
What's, why, why keep going if you don't think we can get out of this fucking ooze falling

42:14.380 --> 42:19.380
upwards, goddamn Leo dying for five days bullshit?

42:19.380 --> 42:21.380
Guys, we're all just in the Uber still.

42:21.380 --> 42:23.380
I believe we can get out of here.

42:23.380 --> 42:24.380
That's fine.

42:24.380 --> 42:26.380
Spud, do you believe we're still in the Uber?

42:26.380 --> 42:29.380
Spud is kind of walking towards one of the doors.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.380
What the fuck, dude?

42:32.380 --> 42:37.380
This is, he's just kind of pacing back and forth.

42:37.380 --> 42:41.380
Now he was walking away and now he's walking toward you and now he's walking away.

42:41.380 --> 42:46.380
Um, and he's just pacing back and forth and he's like, this is not diet.

42:46.380 --> 42:48.380
The last thing that was sick though.

42:48.380 --> 42:50.380
I was like, why?

42:50.380 --> 42:55.380
And I was like, yo, and you guys are all different and stuff and it was crazy.

42:55.380 --> 43:01.380
But this, this guy, I don't know, he's, um, my ears.

43:01.380 --> 43:06.380
Do, do we still have the feeling of contentment that we had while we were on the road?

43:06.380 --> 43:07.380
Oh yeah.

43:07.380 --> 43:08.380
Oh yeah.

43:08.380 --> 43:09.380
Super content.

43:09.380 --> 43:10.380
I don't know what I was complaining about then.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.380
I guess this ain't so bad.

43:13.380 --> 43:18.380
Leo, do you feel content even though you're dying in pain constantly?

43:18.380 --> 43:27.380
I feel like I'm dying, but also like I'm not hungry if that's what you mean.

43:27.380 --> 43:31.380
And I don't think I've slept the whole time I've been here except for being unconscious maybe.

43:31.380 --> 43:34.380
Is that what I mean?

43:34.380 --> 43:35.380
No.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.380
That you're not hungry?

43:37.380 --> 43:38.380
Is that what content is?

43:38.380 --> 43:39.380
I guess it's a big ol' no.

43:39.380 --> 43:41.380
I was just trying to describe my physical state to you.

43:41.380 --> 43:42.380
He's not hungry.

43:42.380 --> 43:43.380
He's not sleepy.

43:43.380 --> 43:45.380
He is in pain, but he's managing.

43:45.380 --> 43:47.380
Is this a riddle or is this meat?

43:47.380 --> 43:51.380
We're detectives' greatest detectives, so we're just thinking out loud.

43:51.380 --> 43:55.380
I don't, I don't know about you guys, but I don't think there's much more we can do here.

43:55.380 --> 43:59.380
I think, I think if we're going to find a way out, we got to start trying to find a way out.

43:59.380 --> 44:01.380
Shh.

44:01.380 --> 44:06.380
Do you, do you guys think we should go out the door that Julie went out or do you think we should go out that one?

44:06.380 --> 44:07.380
Can I point to the other one?

44:07.380 --> 44:09.380
I kind of like Spud's instincts.

44:09.380 --> 44:10.380
I don't know.

44:10.380 --> 44:11.380
Which one did he go to?

44:11.380 --> 44:19.380
Spud throws open the latch on the hatch that was first visible in this unearthly piston junkyard of a room,

44:19.380 --> 44:26.380
and he turns back to fully face you with double finger guns as the door behind him swings open.

44:26.380 --> 44:32.380
Without turning back around to confirm his footing, he steps backward over the threshold.

44:32.380 --> 44:42.380
Dudes, we got to find a way out of this place, and my instincts are on point!

44:42.380 --> 44:52.380
Spud, with nothing for his feet to land on, falls back and disappears completely from your view as his voice trails off and turns to a shriek.

44:52.380 --> 45:00.380
And beyond the doorway, you all look out and see a technicolor sky your eyes cannot quite comprehend.

45:00.380 --> 45:04.380
And it is, at the same time, completely dark.

45:04.380 --> 45:14.380
The nothingness is endless, but below the horizon is a shimmering silver sea.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.380
Holy shit! This is so cool!

45:18.380 --> 45:23.380
Well, I thought we should just maybe follow him through that door, but now I'd like to peek through first.

45:23.380 --> 45:26.380
I was gonna, like, weed like three stooges' heads.

45:26.380 --> 45:29.380
Yeah, what's down below if we...

45:29.380 --> 45:41.380
Looking down, you see this room you're all in is on stilts, and a ladder goes down about ten yards and disappears into this placid, shining ocean

45:41.380 --> 45:47.380
that surrounds Leo's auxiliary piston junkyard for as far as you can see.

45:47.380 --> 45:57.380
But just below, Spud is laying on top of this gleaming expanse, and his face is contorted into a twisted grimace.

45:59.380 --> 46:20.380
A pained squeak is drowned out into a gargle as the patch-covered hippie slowly sinks backward in Han Solo pose, down into the shimmering silver sea.

46:21.380 --> 46:24.380
Johnny Kevin Moore shuts the door.

46:26.380 --> 46:28.380
Clarky yanks it back open.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.380
Let's try that other one, guys.

46:30.380 --> 46:31.380
I gotta see how this ends.

46:31.380 --> 46:33.380
I help him open the door.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.380
Say your piece and then I'll close this damn door.

46:35.380 --> 46:38.380
As you look out the door a second time...

46:38.380 --> 46:40.380
Oh, look who it is.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.380
No, Justin.

46:41.380 --> 46:50.380
You see a boat made of this familiar inky black, unnaturally colorful material that also makes up the sky.

46:50.380 --> 46:54.380
And two men are standing on this craft.

46:54.380 --> 46:57.380
One is a short stout man in his latter years.

46:57.380 --> 47:02.380
A thick white beard makes his round face look even rounder.

47:02.380 --> 47:06.380
The bags under his eyes are large and fluffy.

47:06.380 --> 47:13.380
He's wearing a dark navy beanie and a wool plaid shirt under olive corduroy overalls.

47:13.380 --> 47:20.380
And the other man is John Lee Pettymore IV's uncle, Don D. Pettymore.

47:20.380 --> 47:24.380
Justin, what does Uncle Don look like?

47:24.380 --> 47:29.380
Ooh, Uncle Don is about 6'2", kind of sinewy.

47:29.380 --> 47:37.380
He's got that leathery, been out in the sun too long, strong, dark hair that's very disheveled right now.

47:37.380 --> 47:42.380
Does not look as though he has bathed in quite some time, let's say.

47:42.380 --> 47:45.380
And he's wearing like a buttoned up shirt that's all like...

47:45.380 --> 47:49.380
It's not looking super great in a thick ol' mustache.

47:49.380 --> 47:53.380
Uh, hi, Uncle Don.

47:53.380 --> 47:54.380
What, how...

47:54.380 --> 47:57.380
Wait, do I see...

47:57.380 --> 48:00.380
Is that John?

48:00.380 --> 48:02.380
Oh, he sees me.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.380
Hey, Uncle Don, uh...

48:04.380 --> 48:06.380
I start going down the ladder.

48:06.380 --> 48:08.380
Can't we check the other door first?

48:08.380 --> 48:10.380
Don, you could climb up the ladder.

48:10.380 --> 48:20.380
Keith goes down the ladder, but he does it like in a video game when you hit the sprint button when you go down and you just like hold the side and slide down it.

48:20.380 --> 48:24.380
Yeah, like, he does that.

48:24.380 --> 48:28.380
But again, like, we're still up here in this other plane, there's a whole other door.

48:28.380 --> 48:33.380
Who knows who he might invite to the Discord chat if we open that door.

48:33.380 --> 48:37.380
LAUGHTER

49:03.380 --> 49:07.380
LAUGHTER

49:34.380 --> 49:39.380
What kind of world are you living in?

49:42.380 --> 49:48.380
What kind of world are you living in?
