00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
How do you do fellow wolf pups? It's your fellow teen wolf. Wolf the dog pup.

00:07.240 --> 00:13.080
I like to skateboards, roller them blades, and vape that juice.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.240
When I spit them hot stinky thick gunky clouds

00:18.040 --> 00:25.840
Shoot, dang. I get so many likes and so many subscribes and I am streaming at you live from

00:25.840 --> 00:34.480
694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that is also where I am currently living.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.480
I am the influencer.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.400
My influence shall know no bounds.

00:40.400 --> 00:47.840
I shall eat Mark Zuckerberg's eyes so that he may see the dark void for all eternity.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.160
Smash that like button.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.600
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach.

00:53.640 --> 01:01.680
But not the one you know. From occupied Piscataway and Anacostian land known as Washington, DC

01:02.240 --> 01:09.600
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. A very productive use of 15 seconds.

01:09.600 --> 01:15.040
He writes, I have a little love song for a very special something in my life.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.560
My baby takes the morning train.

01:18.960 --> 01:26.800
As shelter from the rising sun, she will return to me again to finally waitin' for her.

01:26.800 --> 01:33.360
My baby's eyes can see through time. She sings to me what must be done.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.880
The life I had's no longer mine. The world is waitin' for her.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.200
Wow, Zach. What a wonderful ditty you done and gone and composed over there.

01:45.760 --> 01:50.800
The only songs I write cannot be interpreted by human ears.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.640
I think yours can though, so that's probably good.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.240
Anyway, if you want to write up something for your influencer wolf to how,

02:00.240 --> 02:03.920
tag it pretending pod on Instagram or Twitter.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.320
These fuckers at pretending to be people repost amazing fan art,

02:08.320 --> 02:10.480
share behind the scenes moments,

02:10.480 --> 02:17.360
and dish out hot visual content with every new episode over on that there social media.

02:18.080 --> 02:25.360
Life is full of grays, complex situations, so fuck Mark Zuckerberg and smash that follow button.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.360
Fuck Jack Conte and support us on Patreon. Fuck me?

02:29.360 --> 02:34.960
And picture whatever it is you think I look like the next time you're about to bust a whole nut.

02:34.960 --> 02:40.800
Then you'll inevitably want to have a little snooze, but keep it up. It's time for the news.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.720
Last time, Clark ran away from the site of the shimmering silver sea

02:46.720 --> 02:53.120
and into Dr. Marie Jacobs and Salem the cat in Doug Jacobs' body.

02:53.120 --> 02:58.800
He kept fleeing, but the next door brought him through the same threshold he had just crossed.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.960
He bumped into John, who had just opened up the same hatch,

03:02.960 --> 03:08.560
and the two stumbled forward to greet the witch doctor and her cat man familiar.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.560
Down the ladder, Keith lied to the boat's hosts, Don D. Pettymore and Jack Russell.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.800
He told them he knew where the door Jack searched for was located.

03:18.800 --> 03:25.440
From this sea level view, Keith saw a rope bridge on the adjacent wall to the ladder he had just

03:25.440 --> 03:31.840
used that led to a second stilted bunker above this shiny sterling surf.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.200
Back in the room that wasn't filled with junk and a helpless Leo piston,

03:37.200 --> 03:41.760
Clark and John yucked Dr. Marie Jacobs yum for a while,

03:41.760 --> 03:48.000
and then John found solace in his quantumly colorful orifice ooze.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.480
I think the image of old John squirting goo out his face holes would make for some sick album art.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.480
Speaking of, take a moment. Check out Bandcamp or Spotify or MySpace

04:01.440 --> 04:07.280
For those of you who are too young to remember, MySpace is my temperature contrasting basement

04:07.280 --> 04:13.040
studio where I find the hottest new tracks with the coolest album art.

04:13.600 --> 04:19.120
An example might be Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

04:30.480 --> 05:00.320
Uh, Thomas, Joe, any last words?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.280
Last words.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.680
Yeah, sorry we ended on such a banger for you last time that you really want to...

05:07.680 --> 05:08.560
Okay, headphones off.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.360
You want to, you just want to shut us down, you just don't want to...

05:13.360 --> 05:14.240
Like, all of us?

05:14.240 --> 05:17.040
Yeah, this was just an exercise to like,

05:17.040 --> 05:21.440
oh, thanks for doing that, but that's worthless to me now. Now's a new moment.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.720
Yeah, that was a week ago.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.040
Is it all disposable to you? Is that what this is?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.200
Yeah, right?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.000
Disposable, like a camera.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.400
Or thumbs on a human.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.160
Yeah, disposable thumbs.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.560
That's what makes me a human.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.920
That's what sets us apart.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.080
Yeah, our disposable thumbs.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.560
Uh, Zach, if we say anything else, it's basically going to be half this episode

05:46.560 --> 05:50.880
in conversation with Marie Jacobs, so why don't you just go on over to those other boys?

05:50.880 --> 05:53.760
Thank you. I appreciate it.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.640
Take your headphones off. Thomas, take your headphones off.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.140
Joe.

05:58.160 --> 05:58.640
Thank you.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.080
Hello, Luke and Justin. Hi.

06:02.080 --> 06:02.800
Hello, Rosanne.

06:02.800 --> 06:07.840
Hi. You guys are climbing a ladder. You guys are climbing a ladder.

06:08.800 --> 06:14.880
First on the ladder is Jack Russell, this man in a beanie, big fluffy beard.

06:14.880 --> 06:19.520
And behind him, Keith Vigna, who's looking up and just said, nice view.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.400
And then behind him, Don D. Pettymore, the three of you are climbing the ladder,

06:24.400 --> 06:31.360
just after Keith Vigna came to a realization about where the hatches were

06:31.360 --> 06:34.080
in the room you're about to walk up into.

06:34.080 --> 06:40.560
And then where the rope bridge is that is seemingly not attached to a door

06:40.560 --> 06:44.320
that you could see in this bunker-like room that you were in before.

06:44.320 --> 06:50.160
This bunk yard, junker bunker, junker junk yard bunker, piston junk yard bunker yard.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.480
The man above you kind of looks down between the ladder

06:54.480 --> 06:59.280
and his big belly and sees you below and is like, oh, you new boy.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.160
How'd you get here?

07:00.800 --> 07:01.840
Are you talking to me?

07:01.840 --> 07:05.600
Yeah, me and the other fella here was old cats.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.960
We got here different ways.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.680
How'd you get here?

07:07.680 --> 07:08.800
I kind of floated in.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.240
Floated?

07:10.240 --> 07:10.800
Yeah.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.840
No, I mean, what got you before you fell up?

07:13.840 --> 07:16.080
What got me? Goo.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.580
Goo?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.400
Where are you from, boy?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.880
Contention, USA.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.840
What about you?

07:21.840 --> 07:24.560
You sound like you're from across the pond.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.880
I'm from Contention too, but...

07:26.880 --> 07:28.720
Well, not you, this other guy.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.240
Oh, this guy.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.480
You sound like you're from across the pond.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.920
No, I'm from Contention.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.320
I thought he was talking about like the actual creek.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.720
You sound like you're from across Bean's Pond.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.600
You know, the dialect, it do change if you go, yeah.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.800
It's very distinct from one side of Contention to the other.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.840
Honestly, mate, I feel like I've lived so many lives.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.520
I'm so old, you know, my memories just feel like someone else's.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.480
How old are you?

07:54.480 --> 07:55.360
I don't even know.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I have a lost period of time there.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.600
How did you guys get here?

07:59.600 --> 08:00.720
What is here?

08:00.720 --> 08:01.760
Where are we?

08:01.760 --> 08:05.200
No fucking clue, but we're looking for the door out.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.680
Do you know where it is or...

08:07.680 --> 08:10.960
And at this point in time, you've easily climbed a 10 yard long ladder.

08:11.520 --> 08:17.600
And so the three of you will go back into this junkyard of a room

08:17.600 --> 08:23.600
where you do hear the crying sounds of Leo Piston as he is just in tortured pain.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.520
Jack Russell turns around, helps you finish up the ladder trek,

08:31.520 --> 08:33.280
does the same for Don D. Pettymore.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.840
Leo, I feel awful bad.

08:36.800 --> 08:38.720
Are you just gonna lay there or...

08:38.720 --> 08:41.760
Nah, I can't do anything else.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.040
It hurts too bad.

08:43.040 --> 08:43.840
Are you gonna...

08:43.840 --> 08:45.040
Do you think you're gonna make it?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.680
Are you gonna be better or is this the rest of your life?

08:50.880 --> 08:52.400
Forever, probably.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.040
If you find a way out, I guess come get me.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.800
Okay, okay.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.760
Will do, will do.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.120
I'm sure that I will not forget about you.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.280
Hey, what's your name again?

09:05.280 --> 09:06.560
Who, me?

09:06.560 --> 09:08.080
The kid, you, yeah.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.520
That's Leo Piston.

09:09.520 --> 09:09.840
Ligma?

09:09.840 --> 09:10.880
No, but you.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.120
Me? I'm Keith.

09:13.120 --> 09:13.760
Yeah.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.960
Keith Vigna.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.400
Keith, who the hell is that?

09:16.400 --> 09:18.560
That, I just told you, it's Leo Piston.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.800
Oh, I thought you said Ligma Piston.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.760
Ligma Piston.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.080
Yeah, Leo runs the up dog.

09:30.080 --> 09:38.480
God damn it.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.800
I wanna know what the goo is, mate.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.800
I got here because I got eaten by some fucking monster in a lake.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.680
He got here because he jumped through, I don't even fucking believe him.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.040
I took a step in a, in a bag.

09:53.040 --> 09:53.680
What?

09:53.680 --> 09:54.320
A bag?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.520
And I got here.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.880
What sort of bag?

09:56.880 --> 09:59.760
Here's a Nike bag.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.160
Oh.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.320
Things go in, they, they usually don't come out.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.680
Where'd you get it?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.200
I've always had it.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.880
You've always had-

10:10.880 --> 10:12.720
It's, I, I use the bag.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.760
You still have it?

10:13.760 --> 10:14.640
Do I still have it?

10:14.640 --> 10:14.880
Yeah.

10:15.440 --> 10:15.840
No.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.480
Where is it?

10:16.480 --> 10:17.600
That's how I got in here.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.520
So we're in your bag?

10:20.880 --> 10:26.160
Maybe we gotta find another bag or a hole in the ceiling.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.320
Where the bag opens up.

10:28.320 --> 10:32.000
Yeah, but I got here because I got eaten by a fucking lake monster.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.040
Which lake?

10:33.040 --> 10:34.080
Lake Comb.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.840
At Comb Comfy Campground.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.440
Oh, I thought you said comb.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.600
Like, you gotta talk better, man.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.920
Now if you just listen better, you can understand my friend Jack Russell here.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.560
That's right.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.880
Should we walk across that bridge?

10:46.880 --> 10:52.400
Jack Russell starts moving all the junk that's in the way on that wall that's adjacent to

10:52.400 --> 10:54.480
where you just walked into this room.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.840
He clears this wall, there's no hatch.

10:57.840 --> 11:04.560
Leo, did you see where, where'd, uh, where'd, uh, my friends go?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.160
Did you forget their names?

11:06.160 --> 11:07.040
Clark and John.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.200
Jesus Christ.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
I had a total brain fart there.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.200
How do you not know?

11:15.200 --> 11:18.960
Clark and John went through that hatch and he points to the other hatch.

11:18.960 --> 11:24.080
I look at Jack and Don and kind of point at that hatch.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.280
You guys, well, after you, I guess.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.480
Lead the way, Jack.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.960
All right, I guess, well, yeah, we'll all just go in here.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.200
I mean, what, you got any other ideas?

11:33.200 --> 11:34.800
Oh, no, I guess not.

11:34.800 --> 11:38.880
And he slams open the lever of the hatch and opens up the door.

11:38.880 --> 11:39.680
What do I see?

11:40.320 --> 11:47.840
Clark and John, their backs as they are standing in a empty room that does not have a ceiling

11:47.840 --> 11:49.600
on it, or maybe it does.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.640
It's all just this, I found the top of the bag.

11:52.640 --> 12:00.960
And they are talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs and Doug Jacobs who are laying on the ground.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.160
Dr. Marie Jacobs.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.200
When was the last time I saw them?

12:05.200 --> 12:09.680
Oh, the last time you saw them was on a security camera because they weren't in their cell

12:09.680 --> 12:10.640
anymore.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.640
And you looked at the security footage and saw them being picked up and slammed into

12:14.640 --> 12:15.840
the ground repeatedly.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.400
And then they disappeared as if you had never seen them.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.680
Yeah, and then that just didn't stick in my mind, apparently.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.600
That was just normal goings on.

12:24.400 --> 12:30.880
Clark Bishop and John Lee, Kevin Moore III, you feel the hatch behind you open.

12:31.840 --> 12:38.960
And as you turn around, you see that Keith Vigna, Keith Beans, has arrived into this

12:38.960 --> 12:47.520
room along with Don D. Pettymore and this man wearing the beanie and the overalls that

12:47.520 --> 12:49.280
are made of corduroy.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.440
Before you ask anything, we've got the cat fucking all out of control.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.040
Or under control.

12:55.040 --> 12:55.440
What?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.360
Cat fucking is under control.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.120
It's not out of control, it's under control.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.520
Now what the hell are you boys doing under your boat?

13:01.520 --> 13:04.400
I thought that was the boat that would take us out of here eventually.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.520
Oh, we tied it up.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.160
All right, all right.

13:06.160 --> 13:12.800
As I'm now closer and I'm realizing that my eyes weren't paying tricks on me, Don D.

13:12.800 --> 13:21.200
is kind of frozen a little bit, seeing what appears to be his brother, but with kind of

13:21.200 --> 13:22.720
a different sounding voice.

13:23.360 --> 13:29.280
Also, as you look at him, you know how you've been in here for a while and you've kind of

13:29.280 --> 13:35.680
gotten used to seeing that everything's made out of this inky black substance that is also

13:35.680 --> 13:42.800
super colorful and is also the sky, but also like objects are kind of that color or texture

13:42.800 --> 13:43.520
too.

13:43.520 --> 13:52.240
That same substance is pouring out of John Lee, Pettymore the Third's bodies, eye sockets

13:52.240 --> 13:54.960
and nose and mouth and ears.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.960
Are you okay, John?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.160
Ever been better, Keith?

13:58.160 --> 14:00.320
You look crazy right now.

14:00.560 --> 14:06.240
Do you not see what's happened to touch your face?

14:06.240 --> 14:06.960
Can you feel it?

14:07.600 --> 14:09.920
I mean, no, you can't feel it.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.280
It does look cool.

14:11.280 --> 14:18.960
Brother, I don't want to alarm you, but you got oozed, oozing out your orifices.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.520
That's right.

14:20.080 --> 14:20.640
That's right.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.120
I'm the ghost of your brother.

14:23.120 --> 14:23.440
Boo!

14:27.040 --> 14:28.240
Stupid piece of shit.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.400
I'm your brother, asshole.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, I'm your brother.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.040
What's going on?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.560
How you doing, bro?

14:37.600 --> 14:39.200
Something seems off about him.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.760
Can I roll like a human or something?

14:41.760 --> 14:42.560
Yeah, yeah.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.640
Go ahead and roll persuade against him, Thomas.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.320
I rolled a two.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.560
Tension building.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.040
Sorry, my other D10 fell on the floor.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.160
Oh, yeah.

15:02.160 --> 15:02.640
All right.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.280
That's a 22 on a 60 crit success.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.160
Hell yeah.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.360
All right, nice.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.640
So this is your brother.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.040
It's been a while since you've seen him, huh?

15:11.040 --> 15:16.880
So I mean, God, it's been years and then it's been however long you've been in here.

15:16.880 --> 15:21.440
John, how did you get down here?

15:21.520 --> 15:29.360
John really exaggeratedly rolls his eyes to the side at Keith and Clark.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.200
I need to talk to you for a second.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.400
Violently stabbing his eyes to the side.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.840
Hold on one minute.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.840
Big brother, little brother.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.080
I think I'm your big brother.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.520
Am I your big brother?

15:47.520 --> 15:48.880
And you used to call me little brother.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.840
That's why I said that.

15:49.840 --> 15:54.240
Big brother, I'll be gone for just a second to talk to these fellows,

15:54.240 --> 15:57.680
but I do need to confer with my associates for just a second.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.200
But then we'll catch up.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.160
Clark, Keith.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.160
And then he's really stabbing his eyes to the side.

16:04.160 --> 16:09.120
Hey, if you guys need to talk for a second, we will stay in here with the cat lady

16:09.120 --> 16:11.120
and you can go back in through this hatch.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.840
And he kind of opens up the hatch that's open.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.600
Oh, he opens it more back into the Leo piston bunker junkyard.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.320
All right.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.120
Nobody asked you, British guy.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.920
But while y'all are in here, do not fuck that cat.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.640
We'll be right back.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.400
Puts out his hand.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.080
John reluctantly shakes it as he's trying to walk back.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.920
And he's like, again, no one asked.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.200
We will be right back.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.400
This won't take long.

16:34.400 --> 16:38.080
As Clark walks past Jack, he shakes his hand too.

16:38.080 --> 16:38.880
Like the dog.

16:38.880 --> 16:39.280
Huh.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.960
And then keeps following into the next room.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.120
Okay, I guess, Justin, take off your headphones

16:43.120 --> 16:44.480
because Thomas doesn't want you here.

16:45.280 --> 16:48.480
Goodbye.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.680
Justin, the person knows exactly what this conversation is about.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.880
He just failed the persuade role about it.

16:54.880 --> 17:01.040
So he can be here, but this, this huddle is literally just John saying,

17:02.560 --> 17:08.560
all right, now you might not have quite picked up on what was going on in there.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.800
Might've been a little too subtle.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.400
I never knew you had a brother, John.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.200
That's just the thing.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.160
I don't my pappy did because I'm in the body of my pappy.

17:16.160 --> 17:16.960
That's my uncle.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.680
Right, right.

17:19.200 --> 17:25.280
So why are you, do you just not want to frighten him by telling him who you are?

17:25.280 --> 17:26.800
I just, we don't know.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.640
We don't know who we can trust Keith.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.200
We don't know what is going on in this world.

17:31.200 --> 17:37.040
Is that my uncle or is that the goo manifest in some kind of trader could be either way.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.720
It might behoove us to have some kind of advantage over him.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.880
Like, you know, the hidden identity.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.360
John, what was your relationship with this guy?

17:45.360 --> 17:46.640
Is he a, is he a good uncle?

17:46.640 --> 17:48.400
Is he, was it a strained relationship?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.240
Did you, did you know him very well or?

17:50.240 --> 17:53.360
Now by many more standards, he was a pretty good uncle.

17:53.360 --> 17:59.920
Like about half the time he'd take you on into the bar instead of you having to sit

17:59.920 --> 18:00.800
out in the hard car.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.920
That's nice of him.

18:01.920 --> 18:05.920
That puts him in the top quarter for sure of my uncles.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.880
But at the same time, he's a vicious criminal.

18:09.440 --> 18:15.360
Uh, he's a mean son of a bitch and I don't really recall all my past lives, but I believe

18:15.360 --> 18:16.160
I owe him money.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.840
Is this the one you were telling us about?

18:17.840 --> 18:18.960
Yeah, it is.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.520
And he always just seemed to take a shot into my daddy.

18:21.520 --> 18:26.800
So it, I just, perhaps while I have this physical form, I'm my daddy.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.560
That's my only strategy here.

18:28.560 --> 18:33.040
I don't have steps ahead to this thing that it just felt it's an instinctual move.

18:34.080 --> 18:34.320
Yeah.

18:34.320 --> 18:38.800
Support that or we just, do we eliminate the last 20 minutes of this podcast and just go

18:38.800 --> 18:40.080
in there and tell him who I am?

18:45.520 --> 18:47.120
No, I got your back.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.520
I think playing our cards close to the vest at this point is the best idea if we got the

18:51.520 --> 18:52.640
leg up on them already.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.560
Open up your heart, Jon.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.440
Shut up, Leo.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.840
Yeah, shut the fuck up, Leo.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.600
I'm still here.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.040
You better not tell him who we is.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.400
You're not a part of this.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.320
So don't try to be part of the cool.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.520
You're not part of the quick, but solving the mystery.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.240
Yeah, we know.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.320
Cope, Leo Cope.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.880
We got to go talk to important people in that other room.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.800
Just fucking try not to make too much noise while you're in here.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.120
God damn.

19:23.120 --> 19:29.600
I was, I was thinking you guys remember those pictures that the camera took of the people

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
and the, it was basically just complete blackness.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.080
What if that's that room?

19:36.560 --> 19:38.320
Or all around us, right?

19:38.320 --> 19:43.920
And it, in the kind of the, the state of being we, we, we, or, or, yeah, just this place.

19:44.720 --> 19:51.280
I wonder if what, you know, if that's the thing and what it means, but what, what does

19:51.280 --> 19:51.520
it mean?

19:51.520 --> 19:52.400
Where the hell are we?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.840
Where the hell are we?

19:53.840 --> 19:55.920
We're in the goo world where I'm from.

19:55.920 --> 19:56.720
You're from what?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.800
Have you not seen my God damn goo eyes?

20:00.800 --> 20:04.320
I mean, yeah, but catch up Clark.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.000
I'm Keith.

20:06.080 --> 20:13.600
I mean, mustard Clark, the mundane design, the mundane designations of the old world

20:14.480 --> 20:17.680
kind of ceased to cease to interest me as I spend more time.

20:18.320 --> 20:21.600
I don't know if this is the same experience for all of you, but for me right now, there's

20:21.600 --> 20:26.960
a lot of things that seem impossible and yet are every day, they seem normal and not normal

20:26.960 --> 20:28.160
all the time at the same time.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.320
And when, when John just said that he's from here, that didn't ring any bells for him.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.720
That didn't ping any, any alarms for me.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.880
Oh, uh, that's the end of the last episode.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.080
You should go listen to that.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.080
No, I'm saying it didn't, it didn't scare me that you said that and it sounded normal.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.360
It sounded correct.

20:43.360 --> 20:43.680
Yeah.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.400
Yeah.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.600
The Samesies, bro.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.040
Let's go lie to my uncle.

20:47.040 --> 20:51.200
What were you guys talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs about?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.760
Oh, like very little before you burst in.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.320
You'll honestly get as much a chance to talk to her as we would.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.640
Basically we just established, well, we accused her of cat fuckery.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.400
I don't know if you noticed, but Doug's in there also, but that Salem and Doug's body

21:04.400 --> 21:04.960
remember.

21:04.960 --> 21:10.000
So, and they were, they were cuddling in a really unsettling way.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.480
Exactly.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.200
Right.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.840
Well, yeah, that's the question.

21:13.840 --> 21:20.800
Cause she's all like, Oh, isn't it just normal for a person to just be like hanging out with

21:20.800 --> 21:23.360
their cat and then other stuff.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.200
And you're like, well, what does other stuff mean?

21:25.200 --> 21:28.240
And she's like, how dare you say what other stuff means, you know?

21:28.240 --> 21:30.480
And it's like, she's fucking her cat.

21:30.480 --> 21:31.760
I think that's illegal.

21:32.640 --> 21:43.760
I think we might have to do something about that.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.240
You're absolutely right, Keith.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.160
But we, I think we need to get some information out of that cat fucker.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.400
And I agree that can, that can wait until after it.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.680
So she's another one.

21:57.680 --> 22:02.080
We're just going to have to lie to you and kind of be like, Hey, we are cool with you

22:02.080 --> 22:04.960
and we're not about to arrest you for fucking your cat man.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.800
Also, there's just a question of jurisdiction.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.960
It doesn't seem quite practical here, but we will get to the bottom of all of this.

22:10.960 --> 22:17.440
John Clark, you notice that a lot of the junk on the wall that is adjacent to the two walls,

22:18.160 --> 22:24.480
basically four walls in this piston bunker junkyard and two of the walls that are parallel

22:24.480 --> 22:26.800
with each other have hatches on them.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.560
But then one of the walls has been cleared of junk.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.800
So you can clearly see that junk has been moved.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.640
So you can see three walls now, two with hatches, one without.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.400
Leo, you've been picking up in here?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.840
You've been, you've been cleaning up?

22:41.840 --> 22:46.640
And no, that beast guy came in here, knocked it down and said, why isn't there a fucking

22:46.640 --> 22:47.200
hatch here?

22:47.200 --> 22:52.160
If you want to go onto rope bridge, whatever Keith was talking about.

22:52.160 --> 22:52.480
Yeah.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.080
Jack Russell cleared it out.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.080
Why did they clear out the wall without the door?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.760
Would you see if there was a door behind it?

22:58.960 --> 22:59.680
I would assume.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.360
Why would they do that though Keith?

23:03.360 --> 23:11.920
Uh, or we, uh, uh, I was under the impression that we cleared the junk to see if there was

23:11.920 --> 23:12.320
a door.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.880
I will never find out now.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.960
Listen to the episode.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.960
At the end of the day, it seems like, uh, that these two guys, your uncle and whoever

23:22.960 --> 23:28.480
the Jack Russell is, they've got, they got more of a situational awareness to maybe let's

23:28.480 --> 23:30.000
talk to Jack and Don.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Don said he got in, got here from a bag.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.280
He has a Nike bag.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.200
He got in it and that's how he got here.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.480
Clark gasps.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.560
Did it, did the bag fall into it?

23:42.560 --> 23:44.480
Oh, he got in the bag and now he's here.

23:44.480 --> 23:49.360
Yeah, he's, we're, he's in the bag, which means we're in the bag, which in that room

23:49.360 --> 23:55.360
in there, there didn't seem to be a ceiling on that room.

23:55.360 --> 24:02.080
And so I was thinking maybe that is the, how we got to climb up out of the bag or something.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.840
Oh, you think we're, we're in the bag.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.280
We could technically also be in a giant lake creature.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.520
Why would the roof of the bag be described as having endless stars?

24:11.520 --> 24:17.920
Cause it might be nighttime and the bag is pointed up at the sky.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.000
But you can't see that through the bag, bud.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.080
Well, the bag's probably open.

24:22.080 --> 24:26.400
To, to, to recap though, that bag is the thing that we were throwing, or we were told to

24:26.400 --> 24:29.360
throw balls into that they said they didn't know where those, where those went.

24:29.360 --> 24:33.280
So now we know that guess that they come here, or at least that's what happens when a person

24:33.280 --> 24:34.080
goes in the bag.

24:34.080 --> 24:39.200
Who said just something, perhaps an episode ago about a ball falling from the sky into

24:39.200 --> 24:40.080
this very ocean.

24:41.040 --> 24:41.600
Was that Marie?

24:41.600 --> 24:42.240
That was me.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.280
That, oh, hey bud.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.640
Hey, you want to talk to me again?

24:47.280 --> 24:53.360
Yeah, how many balls, how many balls you seen fall from the sky?

24:53.360 --> 24:55.600
I reckon one so far.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.440
That was probably the ball we dropped in here.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.080
Yeah.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.400
We've only dropped one ball in here, right?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.600
Two now, I guess.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.200
And John looks kind of proud.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.160
He slicks his hair back.

25:04.800 --> 25:10.960
Uh, I'm embracing my identity, Keith.

25:10.960 --> 25:11.280
Sorry.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.720
My headphones just like stopped working, but now they're back.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.240
So I didn't hear anything you said.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.760
Well, just be happy for me.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.640
I'm happy for you.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.040
Thank you.

25:19.040 --> 25:23.360
Also, Jack Russell said he got swallowed up by a lake creature, so we could also be in

25:23.360 --> 25:24.400
a lake creature too.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.400
And I mean, we didn't, we didn't go in a bag either.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.480
We got sucked up by a wave of ooze.

25:28.480 --> 25:32.400
So it's like all these different vectors point us in the same direction.

25:32.400 --> 25:37.440
That ball came down here like a metal spider and jumped inside Julie Maxwell.

25:37.440 --> 25:42.000
She went out the Marie Jacobs door, which we've been out twice now and wrapped back

25:42.000 --> 25:42.960
around once.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.800
And she wasn't, she wasn't between here and there.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.200
Yeah, but then she left again out the other one.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.840
Oh, she went out, she went out the, she went out the ocean door.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.840
Yeah, she went out both of them a bunch of times.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.800
Does she ever talk to you?

25:54.800 --> 25:56.240
When did she finally leave?

25:56.240 --> 25:57.360
She's coming and going.

25:58.080 --> 25:58.580
Hmm.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.400
When's the last time she left?

26:01.040 --> 26:03.520
Um, two minutes ago.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.400
Oh no.

26:04.400 --> 26:04.880
Two minutes?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.200
Like days, weeks, forever?

26:07.200 --> 26:08.400
It was forever ago.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.840
See guys, this is what I'm talking about.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.080
This, this, this place is, is all, it's all backwards and forwards and yeah.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.600
Makes it real easy to understand where people are.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.720
They could be anywhere.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.000
Well, I suppose that's true.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.840
You know, I'm always right here though.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.800
I'm right here.

26:22.800 --> 26:25.520
We're actually, we're from a time where you weren't right here.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.600
How do you feel about that?

26:27.600 --> 26:28.800
That blow your little gourd?

26:33.680 --> 26:34.160
All right.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.840
Well, you know, I probably should.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.560
That was mean.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.200
That was mean.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.840
I tried to feel superior to you because I'm not lying here, mortally wounded on my back,

26:41.840 --> 26:43.120
just rolling around for eternity.

26:44.400 --> 26:51.360
Oh, when you put it like that, will you please come find me?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.920
If you find a way out, please bring me back.

26:53.920 --> 26:54.160
Yeah.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.880
I mean, yeah, that's, that's the goal.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.360
Remember, I promise not to forget you, Leo.

26:59.360 --> 27:03.520
And I, I am glad, you know, you don't got to keep reminding us.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.160
We'll find you.

27:04.160 --> 27:09.920
Well, if you promise to not forget me, then I'll remind you that you said something about

27:09.920 --> 27:13.840
a bridge being on the other side of this wall, but there ain't no hash out.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.640
That's why we were looking for the height of the hatch for the bridge.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.040
There's a bridge on the other side of this wall.

27:21.040 --> 27:21.920
That is that a fact?

27:22.880 --> 27:23.120
Yeah.

27:23.120 --> 27:28.080
There's a bridge and it goes to, uh, like a Terabithia.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.160
No, it goes to, uh, that's a YA novel.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.400
I don't know how to describe the thing.

27:34.400 --> 27:43.200
It's, uh, if you were to Google Terabithia red sand forts, it would remind you of that.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.720
No, I believe that's where we are.

27:46.240 --> 27:50.800
But wasn't the bridge going to one of those in the ocean?

27:50.800 --> 27:51.280
Okay.

27:51.280 --> 27:51.440
Yeah.

27:51.440 --> 27:56.080
So it goes to, there's a bridge to another one of the things of which we are currently

27:56.080 --> 27:56.960
inside.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.160
Is that the accepted theory?

27:58.880 --> 27:59.680
Yes.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.640
Did Don and Jack see it from their boat?

28:02.640 --> 28:04.160
Is that how they knew it was there?

28:04.160 --> 28:07.280
I saw it when I was down the ladder.

28:07.280 --> 28:07.840
I saw it.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.880
You saw a bridge extended from this feller over to another feller.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.360
Maybe we should try to break, break through the wall.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.640
Clark just wants to touch that wall.

28:18.640 --> 28:23.280
He just wants to walk up to it kind of slowly, both arms outstretched and just kind of feel

28:23.280 --> 28:23.600
it.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.640
Is there anything there?

28:24.640 --> 28:25.040
Oh yeah.

28:25.680 --> 28:32.480
It feels like a little oozy like goo because it's dark and colorful and, uh, and your hand

28:32.480 --> 28:34.240
just kind of like presses into it.

28:35.440 --> 28:39.680
And it's a little wet and cold, uh, but then it's not at all.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.120
It's just normal wall.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.320
I don't break through the other side of it though or anything.

28:44.320 --> 28:49.360
It's just, it's just a solid wall suddenly again at the same time as it being goo.

28:49.360 --> 28:49.920
Of course.

28:50.560 --> 28:55.440
John has a hunch and he wants to touch the wall in the exact same spot where Clark did.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.880
What do you want to do about it?

28:56.880 --> 28:58.400
Does my hand behave the same way?

28:58.400 --> 28:59.520
What do you want to happen?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.600
I want to see if I can just poke right on through.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.720
Roll a natural.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.160
Pass.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.880
29 on a 60 whatever.

29:08.880 --> 29:09.360
Describe.

29:11.760 --> 29:18.560
You can see bad-ass like black ooze coming from John's fingernails and dripping down

29:18.560 --> 29:19.520
his hand.

29:19.520 --> 29:25.360
And as he touches the wall, the ooze from his fingernails kind of reaches out and little

29:25.360 --> 29:30.400
tendrils and the wall reaches out and little tendrils back and they emerge and then his

29:30.400 --> 29:31.840
hand just passes through.

29:31.840 --> 29:32.320
Yup.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.000
And he's like, Oh, I got us.

29:34.560 --> 29:39.600
And John just kind of like whips open an opening because it's, it's just him.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.400
It's the same thing.

29:41.120 --> 29:49.040
What the absolute fuck is that?

29:49.040 --> 29:54.800
As the other hatch opens, Jack Russell and Don D. Pettymore walk into this room as John

29:54.800 --> 30:03.680
Lee moves his hands into this wall and makes an opening and you can see out there is a

30:03.680 --> 30:09.120
looks like a rope bridge, but it's made out of the same texture that makes up the wall

30:09.120 --> 30:11.760
and the sky and everything around you.

30:11.760 --> 30:19.120
And it's a rope bridge that leads to a second bunker stilted above about 10 yards.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.840
This shimmering silver sea.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.720
Do you guys think we should go across?

30:24.720 --> 30:25.920
I start walking across it.

30:26.880 --> 30:27.760
Wait, Keith.

30:27.760 --> 30:33.040
Keith, careful that, uh, we don't know where, uh, uh, Leo told us that Julie's ball now

30:33.040 --> 30:34.960
and it sounds like maybe a mean ball.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.640
I don't know if it's a good ball, like John here, or if it's a mean ball.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.520
Like we've like a spine ripping ball.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.360
She could, she could be anywhere.

30:43.360 --> 30:44.400
You mean you ball.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.920
I didn't mean anything by it.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.960
Uh, you know, you know how I feel about you and what we're doing now.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.480
I just mean there's, there's you type of balls and there's Julie Maxwell type of balls.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.640
That seems like there's maybe a helpful ball and not, not helpful balls.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.640
Mean, mean spine ripping balls.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.640
Isn't John a spine ripping ball?

31:04.720 --> 31:08.880
Yeah, I don't know what you, how do you know Julie's a spine ripping ball?

31:08.880 --> 31:11.040
You don't know a goddamn thing about that ball.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.520
You're just assuming that ball is going to rip your spine out.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.240
I am assuming that because, because it did that to Julie.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.120
That's what Leo said.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.440
Leo said it came down and ripped her spine out.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.160
Well, my ball did that to my daddy.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.600
So do you have a problem with that?

31:24.720 --> 31:31.200
I mean, I kinda, I didn't really realize that you were a spine ripping.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.600
Yeah, we never talked about that, but that's crazy.

31:34.880 --> 31:40.320
Dondi Pettymore is now hearing this entity inside of his brother.

31:40.320 --> 31:44.080
Talk about ripping out the spine of his brother.

31:44.080 --> 31:48.080
And for the second or third or millionth time this campaign,

31:48.080 --> 31:50.000
Thomas has forgotten who's in the room.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.240
John, shut the fuck up, uncle Don.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.400
Yeah, I'm, I'm John.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.280
I'm ball.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.920
I just made this opening in the ooze.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.720
Walk through it.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.080
If you want to live, wait, you're any questions?

32:06.080 --> 32:07.440
I didn't think so.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.920
Get across the fucking bridge, uncle.

32:09.920 --> 32:14.240
Dondi Pettymore has like a wild look in his eyes as he approaches.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.560
What he thought was his brother.

32:17.360 --> 32:21.120
John, John, little John, not the rapper.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.400
Don't make a joke about the rapper.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.240
What?

32:26.240 --> 32:27.200
What?

32:27.280 --> 32:27.760
Okay.

32:33.200 --> 32:33.680
Oh no.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.720
I said little John.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.200
Oh no.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.040
You said little John three times.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.960
He grasps you and tries to like, like look, look into your soul.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.320
Is that you boy?

32:46.320 --> 32:47.360
Yeah, it's me.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.960
How the hell did you get in my brother?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.080
I kind of want to know that now too, I guess.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.000
Well, so what happened is, but y'all know I'm ball.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.280
You know I'm ball.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.640
You all know this.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.080
What the hell is ball?

33:00.080 --> 33:01.120
We've talked about me.

33:02.080 --> 33:08.400
Well, I ripped out of my John the fourth spine and I landed in my daddy's spine.

33:08.400 --> 33:15.440
But at the time he was kind of a semi brainwashed, you know, super soldier, half robot for an

33:15.440 --> 33:17.360
evil crime Lord in the city.

33:17.360 --> 33:22.560
You know, more or less my ball took over his body.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.920
That is your brother's body.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.800
I'm your nephew.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.680
You know, you got to laugh.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.080
And well, I'm technically his dad.

33:30.080 --> 33:30.800
Hey, that's right.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.080
Screw you.

33:34.400 --> 33:37.040
I guess it's, I guess it's just the terminology that I was hung up on.

33:37.040 --> 33:42.800
Like just then you just said things like landed in and became, but you ripped out the spine

33:42.800 --> 33:44.960
of a person and put yourself into their place.

33:44.960 --> 33:49.920
That's just a little more violent than I'd ever been picturing before, but I guess you

33:49.920 --> 33:50.720
haven't done it to me.

33:50.720 --> 34:00.080
So John Lee, Kevin Moore, like is just looking dead at Clark.

34:00.080 --> 34:04.320
And he thinks at first that he's looking like the eye, but then he realizes he's looking

34:04.320 --> 34:05.040
right at his neck.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.240
Oh gosh.

34:08.240 --> 34:11.120
It's like, no, no, I never have done that to you Clark.

34:11.120 --> 34:11.920
And I never will.

34:11.920 --> 34:17.200
You got, you got a skinny little neck and he kind of like touches his tongue as he sees

34:17.200 --> 34:18.560
the thick neck of Keith.

34:20.880 --> 34:30.160
Keith Vigna like tries to kind of sink his neck, make it shorter, like a little turtle.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.920
Keith Vigna, are you turtley enough for the turtle club?

34:35.920 --> 34:36.560
Turtle.

34:36.560 --> 34:37.120
Turtle.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.080
What's the turtle club?

34:38.080 --> 34:39.520
Is that a weird looking penis thing?

34:41.680 --> 34:42.720
Is that about wieners?

34:42.720 --> 34:43.680
Yeah, that a wiener thing?

34:43.680 --> 34:45.920
That's about it's about, yeah.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.040
That's about beans.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.320
That's about your dinger.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.920
I'll show you a dinger.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.120
I always say a little ding-a-ling.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.240
Let's go across this bridge.

34:54.240 --> 34:57.200
What I've been saying, but y'all wanted to know about spies.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.520
I think, I think my point still stands.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.560
We don't know the motives of this Julie ball.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.360
Just keep an eye out.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.880
Just keep, keep a head on a swivel.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.640
Yeah, obviously we're looking out for bad guys, but like.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.920
When y'all are saying ball.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.120
What kind of point is that Clark?

35:13.120 --> 35:18.720
That we don't, oh, let's stay in these two, two rooms forever with the weird lady who

35:18.720 --> 35:19.920
fucks her cat man.

35:19.920 --> 35:26.000
Because like maybe something's out there that might wish us ill and like the last five days

35:26.000 --> 35:26.720
of our lives.

35:26.720 --> 35:27.280
Come on, man.

35:27.280 --> 35:31.280
To be honest, I'm just wondering why we're not taking the boat and trying to get farther

35:31.280 --> 35:33.920
away from this area that we know that Julie's in.

35:33.920 --> 35:38.320
Oh, you mean that boat into the endless ocean until the, instead of like the bridge to the

35:38.320 --> 35:39.920
only other structure we can see?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.920
Don and Jack, you guys came from somewhere.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.280
You had to have, you got a boat.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.520
Let's just go back there.

35:45.520 --> 35:50.000
It's been a long time since we've seen a structure, right?

35:50.000 --> 35:53.040
I've been looking for the door out of here, right?

35:53.680 --> 35:56.240
Don here came for another reason.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.520
He's not trying to get out.

35:57.520 --> 35:58.240
How'd you come?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.480
Don, you're not trying to leave this place?

36:00.480 --> 36:04.640
I came purposefully to this place to, uh, to find something.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.240
Find what?

36:06.240 --> 36:08.320
What, your goddamn sense of decency?

36:08.320 --> 36:11.360
So you could go back and spend more money on my race car buckle?

36:11.600 --> 36:14.560
God damn.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.200
That is such a bird.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.720
That was a long time ago, boy.

36:19.520 --> 36:25.280
Well, I'm honestly like, like what does this fucking, you know, criminal piece of shit.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.880
What purpose does he have in a mystical world of goo?

36:29.840 --> 36:31.680
Like what quest do you seek?

36:31.680 --> 36:36.240
You, I thought you to be frankly, a very shallow piece of shit individual.

36:36.240 --> 36:40.720
So I just wonder what greater purpose you might be out here for.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.520
Again, you were in my top four uncles, but like, you know how low that bar was.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.640
You know I raised you.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.560
I did the best I could sometimes.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.120
I had big things I had to do.

36:53.840 --> 36:59.520
I had important jobs to do in contention for very powerful people.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.120
And I'm here to undo some of the harm that I've done.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.420
Okay.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.040
Why don't you expand on that?

37:07.920 --> 37:11.600
How the fuck is anything you're doing here in this goo world turning things right?

37:12.240 --> 37:14.480
John, I had, I used that bag.

37:14.480 --> 37:14.880
Yeah.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.640
We know about the bag.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.000
Where'd you get the bag?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.760
Let's just, where'd you get the bag?

37:19.760 --> 37:21.600
He said he's always had it.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.200
That's always been my mission.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.280
We knew that bag is agent Victor's bag.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.640
You couldn't have always had it.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.080
We had it in fact, for a little bit.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.080
I am agent Victor.

37:31.200 --> 37:31.700
What?

37:32.240 --> 37:36.320
Does that, do you know, do you know McKinley and Kennedy and?

37:37.040 --> 37:39.200
The other one, much more important.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.720
Do you know Kevin?

37:41.280 --> 37:42.720
Do you know K cell?

37:42.720 --> 37:44.160
I can't say I do.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.280
Primarily worked alone, getting rid of items.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.760
That's what the bag is for.

37:49.760 --> 37:56.960
It's to get rid of things and make sure they don't ever come back to where we are, where we were.

37:56.960 --> 38:04.240
Well, it seems like there's, you know, there's a few more portals between our world and the goo

38:04.960 --> 38:06.800
than just this fucking bag.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.640
I started figuring that out.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.840
Cause I've been talking to Jack Russell for, I don't know.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.240
God, I don't fucking know how long.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.440
So long, mate.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.920
Is this your first time that going into the bag?

38:17.920 --> 38:21.120
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know what was going to happen.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.520
Why'd you go into the bag?

38:23.520 --> 38:24.880
John, I did some bad things.

38:24.880 --> 38:30.960
I'm not proud of one of the first things that really started bugging me about all this,

38:30.960 --> 38:34.560
this business is I put a person in the bag.

38:34.880 --> 38:38.160
It was only objects for a long time, but who did you put in?

38:38.160 --> 38:42.400
Their name was, was, was Thomas, Thomas Lewis.

38:42.400 --> 38:47.920
I believe they were an activist and they started coming down with some disease.

38:48.720 --> 38:54.560
The organization I work for told me they'd seen this before and they needed to get rid of it.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.080
Right then and there.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.200
Just following orders.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.120
Uncle, in my experience, people named Thomas are decent and good.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.800
And you should have given them more of a shot.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.880
That's neither here nor there.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.360
So you think we're all in the bag right now?

39:09.360 --> 39:10.160
I don't know.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.840
But if you want to know why I'm here.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.120
Yeah, let him keep talking.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.920
I bet there's more to the story you'd want to hear about.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.800
Yeah, let him keep talking.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.760
Jack Russell's like rubbing my shoulder.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.320
Go on, tell him more.

39:33.760 --> 39:34.880
Who was he?

39:34.880 --> 39:35.680
What was he like?

39:35.680 --> 39:36.400
What did he do?

39:38.560 --> 39:40.080
And now I'm talking like this.

39:41.440 --> 39:41.760
All right.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.360
Nobody asked you about fucking Thomas.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.760
We just said, treat Thomas as nicer.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.920
I asked you, did you jump in the bag and do you think we're in here?

39:51.920 --> 39:56.240
And then Jack was like, yeah, tell him more about Thomas.

39:57.680 --> 39:58.800
That's not what I asked.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.840
So can we just.

39:59.840 --> 40:04.800
I think it's maybe the third time that he would have to establish that he got into the bag.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.080
And that's why he's here.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.520
I didn't ask them to reestablish that.

40:09.520 --> 40:09.840
I just.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.480
This is the bag?

40:15.120 --> 40:16.000
Whatever you want.

40:16.000 --> 40:16.960
Yeah, reestablish.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.320
I know it's confusing.

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
It's confusing to all of us, mate.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.160
It's confusing to everyone.

40:22.160 --> 40:22.880
We don't fucking.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.160
You don't fuck here from London.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.440
Look at that sky.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.600
Is it a blue dress or a silver dress?

40:27.600 --> 40:29.200
Is it black or is it colorful?

40:29.200 --> 40:30.080
I don't fucking know.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.520
Is it Yanny or Laurel?

40:31.520 --> 40:32.960
Goddamn, I hate you.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.600
I'll hate you.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.960
I just absolutely hate you because you've got me.

40:36.960 --> 40:38.480
John, why are you talking like that?

40:38.480 --> 40:40.320
It's some strange effect of this world.

40:41.040 --> 40:41.600
Hold on.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.160
Corn flakes.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.680
All right, go fuck yourself.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.280
Now I've lost track of where we are, but I want that British fellow to stop talking.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.960
So John, here's the thing.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.400
John, you asked him why he got in the bag and he said, well, to explain that, I'll have to go back

40:58.400 --> 41:00.320
farther and started telling us about Thomas Lewis.

41:00.320 --> 41:04.160
So let's just let him catch up to why he got into the bag by telling the story of Thomas Lewis.

41:04.880 --> 41:05.440
Thank you.

41:06.080 --> 41:06.480
All right.

41:06.480 --> 41:06.800
All right.

41:11.040 --> 41:11.680
All right.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.240
All right.

41:12.240 --> 41:12.800
All right.

41:13.520 --> 41:14.480
Now, John.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.200
You got more?

41:15.200 --> 41:17.360
You just want to get your last little bit in there?

41:18.960 --> 41:20.640
He's going to resist saying yeah.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.080
All right.

41:22.080 --> 41:22.320
Yeah.

41:24.640 --> 41:28.160
You see, people can sound like all kinds of shit and they can make you feel shitty too.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.720
I just said I don't want to hear another goddamn word out of that British feller.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.680
And Jack Russell?

41:34.400 --> 41:37.760
If that is your fucking name, I'd like you to respect that for a second.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.720
I'm talking to my uncle.

41:39.600 --> 41:40.720
Now, Don.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.920
Please continue.

41:43.920 --> 41:51.120
So this Thomas Lewis was an activist against this William Beanes fella.

41:51.120 --> 41:54.640
Some kind of tech genius or some billionaire.

41:54.640 --> 41:55.520
I don't know.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.520
What, some kind of Martin Cupertino?

41:57.520 --> 41:58.960
That was my daddy.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.120
Your daddy was Martin Cupertino?

42:01.120 --> 42:02.080
No, Beanes.

42:03.840 --> 42:08.240
You're throwing confusion bombs into this conversation like a terrorist.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.880
You don't even know who Martin Cupertino is.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.160
First of all.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.320
Oh, you do know who Martin Cupertino is?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.440
He's a very famous man.

42:17.440 --> 42:18.160
Very famous man.

42:18.880 --> 42:21.120
It was a very astute character moment.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.760
You don't even know who Steve Jobs is.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.040
Does he exist in this world?

42:25.040 --> 42:27.040
I'm pretty sure his name is Martin Cupertino.

42:28.400 --> 42:28.900
Yeah.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.400
Holy shit.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.640
This Thomas Lewis, they were an activist.

42:36.640 --> 42:37.280
They were young.

42:38.160 --> 42:42.640
It was the first time I'd been ordered to put a person into the bag.

42:42.640 --> 42:45.920
The bag is supposed to be for items, not for people.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.920
I put them in here.

42:47.920 --> 42:48.800
Who knows what happened?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.560
They may have drowned in that metal sea.

42:50.560 --> 42:53.840
I don't know, but that, that didn't even where it all ends.

42:53.840 --> 42:57.280
The madness virus, it seemed to be stopped at that point.

42:57.280 --> 43:00.000
But it was, I was never quite the same.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.400
One of the items I ended up having to put in later.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.160
You're not going to believe it.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.200
It's a, it just looks like a rotary phone.

43:07.200 --> 43:07.840
Like a road.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.960
Have you, have y'all seen a rotary phone around here?

43:11.520 --> 43:12.720
No, we're Gen Z.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.000
You're Jan Z.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.200
We're Gen Z.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.480
We don't know what that is.

43:21.280 --> 43:24.640
That phone might be able to heal everything.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.360
They told me to get rid of this phone.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.800
Why'd they want to get rid of it?

43:28.800 --> 43:35.120
Because no one should have access to any of these magical doodads and items and whatnot.

43:35.680 --> 43:41.440
But after I put that phone in the bag, I knew I made the world a worse place by putting

43:41.440 --> 43:42.320
that phone in there.

43:43.440 --> 43:48.560
And I, and I thought to myself, could I help Thomas if I, if I had that phone?

43:48.560 --> 43:53.040
Maybe I could have prevented all this and maybe I could heal the world.

43:53.040 --> 43:56.000
Maybe I can, maybe I can use it to heal us right now.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.120
Even get us out of here.

43:57.120 --> 44:00.000
I don't know, but I know I need to find it.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.440
What's the phone number for it?

44:04.640 --> 44:05.840
Have you tried calling it?

44:05.840 --> 44:06.080
Yeah.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.520
Yeah, it seems pretty simple.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.960
I don't think that's how it works, but let's, let's give it a shot.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.160
Do you know the number?

44:15.200 --> 44:16.320
Have you even tried?

44:16.960 --> 44:17.920
Yeah, I do.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.840
Why don't we just give it a call?

44:19.840 --> 44:22.720
Let's see who answers.

44:22.720 --> 44:24.880
Do phones work here?

44:24.880 --> 44:26.640
There's only one in the room.

44:26.640 --> 44:30.400
Keith, you got, uh, you still got, you still got yours on you?

44:30.400 --> 44:33.760
Well, it's actually right here and I pull it out.

44:34.960 --> 44:37.440
Beep, beep, beep, boop, beep, bop, boop, boop.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.240
That's me plugging in the numbers.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.360
Why are you making that noise?

44:45.120 --> 44:49.520
Yeah, Keith, Keith, that's, that's really, you just need to dial the numbers.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.680
Please don't, please don't say boop.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.440
Hey Siri, beep, beep, boop, boop.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.760
I guess I take the phone from him and I dial the number.

44:57.200 --> 45:00.320
And I'm making beep boop sounds as he's doing it.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.160
I'm sorry, uncle Don.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.360
He just does that every time.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.200
You got weird new friends.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.280
They're not friends or coworkers.

45:09.280 --> 45:09.840
We're friends.

45:11.040 --> 45:19.440
Across the rope bridge, outside of this John made hole in the wall of this Leo piston

45:19.760 --> 45:26.960
junkyard bunker, seemingly coming from inside the stilted bunker across the way.

45:28.640 --> 45:32.480
You hear a woman's voice going bring, bring

45:35.840 --> 45:38.320
the standard sound of all phones I've ever heard.

45:38.880 --> 45:42.560
Yeah, clearly the sound of this rotary phone.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.600
There's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary with that.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.160
The phone's over there.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.400
It's Claire's day.

45:51.280 --> 45:56.960
I picture you putting tons of echo effect on Taylor's bring, bring off in the distance,

46:01.360 --> 46:06.000
but also somehow muffled metallic reverberations.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.760
It's inside of that other, I honestly wanted, I thought you wanted us to picture like a woman

46:14.080 --> 46:17.600
pretending to ring like a phone from like over there.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.200
And we were just fooled by it.

46:19.200 --> 46:20.480
Pretending to be phones.

46:20.480 --> 46:21.440
Pretending to be phones.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.160
God damn it.

46:26.160 --> 46:29.360
I think Don would, wait, can I get through that hole?

46:29.360 --> 46:30.080
Oh yeah.

46:30.080 --> 46:30.960
Wait, who did you answer?

46:30.960 --> 46:31.460
Oh yeah.

46:32.880 --> 46:35.040
What did, what did, what did Luke say?

46:35.040 --> 46:36.800
I said, I'm going to go towards the ringing.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.400
Whose dexterity is higher?

46:38.400 --> 46:40.720
Mine is 11.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.240
Mine is 12.

46:42.240 --> 46:46.560
John has pushed an arm back real quick, like holding Clark back and he's like,

46:46.560 --> 46:49.280
why don't we just see what happens with these fellers?

46:49.280 --> 46:50.480
Clark is totally fine with that.

46:50.480 --> 46:53.040
He wasn't even jumping at the bit to get out that door.

46:53.040 --> 46:53.760
No, I'll go.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.840
So he's last.

46:55.840 --> 46:59.920
So it'll go Keith, then Don, then Jack.

46:59.920 --> 47:03.200
And the three of them run out onto the rope bridge.

47:04.160 --> 47:09.040
I assume that John and Clark are peeking their head out of this John made hole.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.240
And you all see, not the Bay boat that Don and Jack arrived on, but a new boat.

47:16.560 --> 47:20.000
Also made of this inky colorful darkness.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.840
And this boat has been written on with this shimmering sea.

47:27.440 --> 47:31.600
Numbers cover the entire hull of the boat.

47:32.240 --> 47:39.760
And it says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight.

47:39.760 --> 47:43.360
Which you know to mean oversea.

47:44.320 --> 47:46.560
God damn it, Clark.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.080
It's one of your things.

47:48.080 --> 47:51.280
There are some things that are happening currently.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.120
Do you guys know what the figurehead of a boat is?

47:55.760 --> 47:56.480
Yes.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.160
Is it like the naked lady?

47:58.160 --> 47:58.800
It is.

47:58.800 --> 48:08.560
But in this case, it's a young man with curly black hair and you all see Don's face shine

48:08.640 --> 48:09.920
with recognition.

48:10.640 --> 48:18.880
Because even without his glasses, Don recognizes Thomas Lewis, the activist who is anti-William

48:18.880 --> 48:22.080
Beans, still technically alive.

48:22.080 --> 48:29.200
His mouth is completely steeled shut with the melting silver shimmering sea.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.640
His silver mouth is closed.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.840
His bottom half is in the water.

48:36.560 --> 48:43.120
Continuously melting as he cries in absolutely horrendous pain.

48:52.400 --> 48:57.040
At the front of the boat, you see twins.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.280
And twins.

49:00.960 --> 49:01.920
They are children.

49:02.640 --> 49:04.080
Oh my God.

49:04.080 --> 49:05.600
And kids.

49:06.400 --> 49:14.320
Avery and Alice Little with a bowl cut and pigtails respectively, each with overalls

49:14.320 --> 49:22.880
on, are standing at the front of this boat and behind them is Julie Maxwell wearing a

49:22.880 --> 49:24.240
hospital gown.

49:24.240 --> 49:30.160
She has a massive gash running down her forehead in between her eyes.

49:30.160 --> 49:37.840
Her nose seems to be missing and she smiles at you all with no teeth or lips on one full

49:37.840 --> 49:39.120
side of her face.

49:39.680 --> 49:48.000
That side has an eye, but her other orbital socket is oozing with the dark substance.

49:48.000 --> 49:55.920
And suddenly the body begins to crumple into the boat as a metallic ball rises above with

49:55.920 --> 50:03.920
these silvery shining limbs reaching out, one of which holds up the body of Julie Maxwell

50:03.920 --> 50:08.720
away from the steel shimmering water below this boat.

50:08.720 --> 50:19.040
And the other tendril reaches out and rips at the bridge that Dawn, Keith, and Jack are

50:19.040 --> 50:20.560
currently standing on.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.400
Oh no.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.040
That ain't good.

50:23.040 --> 50:26.560
Well, it's a good thing they showed up right when we started to cross the bridge instead

50:26.560 --> 50:29.920
of when we were well across it, because you fellas just get inside.

50:29.920 --> 50:31.680
Let's all just come back inside.

50:31.680 --> 50:32.560
We'll be fine.

50:32.560 --> 50:36.320
Hey, I'm trying to hide my face from those kids and Clark, you should too, so they don't

50:36.320 --> 50:36.960
recognize us.

50:53.760 --> 51:02.800
I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing

51:02.800 --> 51:03.760
it every time.

51:03.760 --> 51:09.760
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

51:12.560 --> 51:17.760
What kind of world are you living in?

51:23.040 --> 51:45.760
What kind of world are you living in?

51:45.760 --> 51:51.760
What kind of world are you living in?

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
What kind of world are you living in?

51:55.760 --> 51:57.760
What kind of world are you living in?
