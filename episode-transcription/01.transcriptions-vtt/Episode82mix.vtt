00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
Welcome to the cream zone, my lactose-filled babies.

00:03.800 --> 00:06.780
I'm here to whip you up into a frothy beverage

00:06.780 --> 00:08.800
for all to consume.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.720
It's me, your warm milk-filled uncle Wolf the dog.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.480
And as always, we are fermenting y'all

00:16.480 --> 00:19.600
into some kind of weird sour milk cream

00:19.600 --> 00:23.720
live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.240
So far, all of you beautiful, generous folks

00:27.240 --> 00:33.440
have raised $6,372 for the bail project.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.480
Wowza.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.020
Remember, screenshot your donations

00:37.020 --> 00:40.560
and send them to pretendinpod at gmail.com.

00:40.560 --> 00:45.280
And for every $5 donated, you'll receive an entry for a chance

00:45.280 --> 00:50.080
to win one of the first ever PTBP t-shirts.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.960
This week's winner is Marie Lupin.

00:53.960 --> 00:58.480
Congratulations, Marie, and keep on donating, y'all.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.120
We have three more shirts to give away

01:01.120 --> 01:03.920
to you charitable motherfuckers.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.040
The link to donate is in the show notes.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.680
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from a very sweet listener

01:10.680 --> 01:12.120
called Chris.

01:12.120 --> 01:16.480
He writes, a buddy of mine recommended PTBP to me

01:16.480 --> 01:19.000
a while back, but I didn't think I would ever

01:19.000 --> 01:23.240
be into an actual play podcast, let alone one

01:23.280 --> 01:25.800
that features a game I've never heard of.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.320
He kept nagging me, though, and I finally

01:28.320 --> 01:32.120
gave in and listened to episode one a couple of months ago,

01:32.120 --> 01:34.520
just so I could get it over with.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.600
Since then, I've binged every episode,

01:37.600 --> 01:42.600
became a patron, convinced two other friends and my brother

01:42.600 --> 01:45.680
not only to start listening to PTBP,

01:45.680 --> 01:49.080
but also to start playing Delta Green.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.400
I've converted my wife as well, and we are now

01:52.440 --> 01:56.880
relistening to old episodes in between new episodes

01:56.880 --> 01:58.680
just to get our fix.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.120
Then contention boys, the gravelly baritone

02:02.120 --> 02:06.800
of the Mighty Wolf, and the manic brilliance of Zack

02:06.800 --> 02:10.040
have been a source of so much joy during what has been

02:10.040 --> 02:12.680
an incredibly hectic couple of months.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.080
I cannot thank you guys enough.

02:15.080 --> 02:19.840
Shout outs to my friends, Ruben, Alex, and Jesse,

02:19.840 --> 02:23.040
my brother Michael, and my wife Maria,

02:23.040 --> 02:25.360
all of whom are loyal listeners.

02:25.360 --> 02:29.120
Lots of love from the Netherlands, Chris.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.920
Wow, Chris, I know you said a bunch of other shit,

02:32.920 --> 02:36.160
but acknowledging my baritone tones,

02:36.160 --> 02:39.360
the gravel in my gullet, that's enough

02:39.360 --> 02:42.160
to bring tears to my eyes, baby.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.240
Maybe I'll take a little interdimensional trip

02:45.240 --> 02:47.760
to the Netherlands you speak of.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.480
Pay you and yours a little visit, you'll never see me,

02:51.480 --> 02:55.760
but I'll definitely see and smell y'all.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.440
Have you ever thought to yourself, wow,

02:59.440 --> 03:02.720
I like this pretending to be people show very much.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.120
I wonder if there's something easy I could do to help him.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.320
The answer is very fucking much a yes.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.040
Write a five star review on Apple Podcasts,

03:12.040 --> 03:15.440
follow our social media pages for cute pics,

03:15.440 --> 03:18.200

03:23.600 --> 03:25.840
The links are in the show notes.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.840
The links are in the show notes.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.640
Is there an echo in here, or is it just the news?

03:34.640 --> 03:39.200
News, news, news, news, news.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.080
Last time, our valiant heroes forced Terrence Liquor

03:43.080 --> 03:45.240
into the home of Randy Angst,

03:45.880 --> 03:48.000
where the old man was on the ground

03:48.000 --> 03:50.720
in desperate need of medical attention.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.040
Seeing they were about to get boxed in

03:53.040 --> 03:55.480
on this residential street by a truck

03:55.480 --> 03:58.160
with a hot tub instead of a truck bed,

03:58.160 --> 04:02.120
as well as a Chevy Impala with a doorless refrigerator

04:02.120 --> 04:04.600
on its side strapped to the roof.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.120
They stole T Liquor's truck and hoofed it back

04:08.120 --> 04:13.120
to the hidden Mitsubishi Eclipse to grab Drew Carey

04:13.320 --> 04:16.040
without first losing their tail.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.000
Clark grabbed Drew's body and tossed him

04:19.000 --> 04:21.240
into the stolen truck's waterbed

04:21.240 --> 04:24.880
as the refrigerator Impala and hot tub truck

04:24.880 --> 04:26.720
pulled up to the scene.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.440
There wasn't much of a standoff though,

04:29.440 --> 04:32.240
due to hot tub truck immediately losing

04:32.240 --> 04:37.240
its three team members to a massive wave of ooze.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.520
The refrigerator Impala, owned and operated

04:40.520 --> 04:45.040
by Asher and Avery Little, nope the fuck outta there,

04:45.040 --> 04:47.640
leaving our waterbed truck crew

04:47.640 --> 04:52.600
as this oozy upsurges only a remaining target.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.920
John Lee Pettymore the 3rd,

04:54.920 --> 04:58.840
perhaps still wet from his time in the bed of his truck,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.840
critically failed a drive check,

05:01.840 --> 05:04.640
taking us now to the aftermath.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.440
It's a brand new track that rocks,

05:07.440 --> 05:12.440
like sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous,

05:12.600 --> 05:15.760
and rolls like a stolen truck

05:15.760 --> 05:18.800
into a sign for a local tire shop.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.320
It's kudzu with no backbone.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.160
And now.

05:39.040 --> 05:43.120
If a little rat dick left his seed in you,

05:43.120 --> 05:48.120
wouldn't you fucking demand every goddamn cent

05:49.480 --> 05:51.320
he had for that child? Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

05:51.320 --> 05:55.920
That was the perfect introduction to episode.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.240
No, I don't want to make an enemy of David Spade.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.600
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.600
That was a really good introduction to episode 82.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.080
It works if you just blink out,

06:09.080 --> 06:12.440
if you beep out the name of the celebrity.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.040
Only the first time though.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.920
She was discovered by radio superstar Howard Stern.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.640
Her mother sent Stern pictures

06:28.640 --> 06:29.880
and a letter about her daughter.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.720
Stern had her in and sent her pictures to Playboy

06:32.720 --> 06:34.040
and she was accepted.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.480
Oh, that's an American like, thanks mom, dream.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.880
I believe in you, honey.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.480
Here, send your nude pictures to Howard Stern.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.600
Her mom got to tell her

06:44.600 --> 06:46.440
as soon as she got off the school bus.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.280
Yeah.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.360
Would you rather have to have sex

06:52.360 --> 06:54.480
with a Howard Stern or David Spade?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.720
Oh my God.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.000
What a terrible, would you rather?

07:05.480 --> 07:07.360
I guess both.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.200
I'd probably go with David Spade.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.560
I don't know enough about either of them.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.200
So the romance wouldn't be there.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.040
Either way.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.400
Now I'm looking up ugly David Spade

07:16.400 --> 07:17.800
and ugly Howard Stern

07:17.800 --> 07:20.040
to see who has a worst picture on the internet.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.040
Probably David Spade.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.080
You can go to at pretending pod

07:26.080 --> 07:30.560
to get a side by side of those on Instagram

07:30.560 --> 07:31.440
or on Twitter.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.560
We'll be tagging David Spade's family members.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.960
He's cute when he's younger.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.160
Yeah, if we're talking like Tommy boy years,

07:39.160 --> 07:40.680
then it's David Spade all day.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.080
But if we're talking about old, both of them,

07:43.080 --> 07:45.000
then I think I have to go for Stern.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.840
Stern's not bad looking.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.000
Well, it would just be a freaky

07:48.000 --> 07:51.080
kind of like Bourdain-ish experience.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.600
We could probably get more viewers

07:52.600 --> 07:54.520
if we were on Stern's show

07:54.520 --> 07:56.920
than anything David Spade did.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.400
Well, that's not happening after this.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.320
After what?

08:02.320 --> 08:03.800
After we said we want to fuck him?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.520
Sounds to me like we're playing all our cards right.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.480
I don't know anything about him,

08:09.520 --> 08:12.200
but I think that's kind of his whole show, right?

08:14.200 --> 08:17.480
Howard Stern kind of looks like if I was a dinosaur.

08:18.920 --> 08:19.920
Like a raptor.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.320
He's got the same hair.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.120
You should grow yours out long like his.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.440
Have it go down your back.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.320
I mean, I don't plan on getting it cut anytime soon.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.880
It's getting long, baby.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.200
So last time John was driving the truck,

08:34.200 --> 08:36.160
Crit failed to avoid the crane

08:36.160 --> 08:38.080
and flipped it, freeze frame.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.960
The truck is turned sideways,

08:39.960 --> 08:41.480
hits a little rock or something.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.040
Tires are bald as fuck and begins turning over.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.640
In this moment, I have you guys all roll for constitution.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.920
John critically succeeds.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.440
Keith passes.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.320
Clark critically succeeds.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.520
As the truck is flying over, everyone is fine.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.160
Seemingly, except for Keith lands on top of Jimmy Sanders.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.600
Gonna roll for him right now.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.560
Rolled to 98.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.760
He's not doing great.

09:06.760 --> 09:11.520
He's gonna lose four hit points and stays conscious

09:11.520 --> 09:13.440
as Keith lands on top of him.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.520
Critically succeeding his constitution check

09:16.520 --> 09:19.040
to stay conscious because he's low on hit points

09:19.040 --> 09:20.960
leading up to this point.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.440
And Clark literally crits with a 69.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.560
So as the truck rolls, the water's flying out behind him

09:27.560 --> 09:30.680
as he just keeps his legs moving and keeps running

09:30.680 --> 09:32.160
and the truck just avoids

09:32.160 --> 09:35.080
and the truck moves, rolls, rolls, rolls

09:35.200 --> 09:40.200
and explodes into a sign for owls, tires and tigers.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.640
Oh yeah.

09:44.640 --> 09:49.560
The issue being Drew's body with Kerry pages inside

09:49.560 --> 09:54.360
lays motionless in an extremely shallow puddle

09:54.360 --> 09:56.800
of stinky, stinky water.

09:56.800 --> 10:01.800
And Gary Bailey from hanging halfway up out of a sewage drain

10:05.240 --> 10:06.080
What are those called?

10:06.080 --> 10:07.480
Just the like long thin ones

10:07.480 --> 10:09.960
that the Kleinfella comes out of?

10:09.960 --> 10:10.800
Sorry, storm drain?

10:10.800 --> 10:11.640
Yes.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.240
So what's a culvert?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.440
Okay, can you actually not mention it?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.080
Cause I was gonna make a dope it joke.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.800
Okay, but I'm leaving that in for sure.

10:20.800 --> 10:21.760
Cause that's funny.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.760
So a storm drain, like a cauldron.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.840
Is a cauldron like a witch?

10:29.840 --> 10:33.320
I said culvert, which I think is an open drain.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.880
Or maybe a culvert, right?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.160
Is a big round one maybe

10:37.160 --> 10:39.320
that comes out of like the side of a hill.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.240
Joe's right.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.400
Yeah, so we're all right.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.400
And so it's a storm train on the side of the road

10:47.520 --> 10:50.000
and Gary Daley is like half out of it.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.920
Hands, elbows on the concrete and he's hollering at you.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.320
Officer Bishop, Officer Vigna.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.380
Oh, Keith, you need to get down here.

10:58.380 --> 10:59.220
What are y'all doing?

10:59.220 --> 11:02.960
And looking behind you, you see this ooze,

11:02.960 --> 11:06.800
this massive grouping of ooze.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.640
You've never seen this much all in one place before.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.040
It is coming toward you slowly.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.760
The back end of it coming up over the top

11:14.760 --> 11:17.200
like waves breaking.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.620
And as I'm doing this with my arms,

11:18.620 --> 11:20.100
you can see my pit stains.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.600
They are deep, wide.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.680
Like the Lord's love.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.800
And it is just flowing, flowing toward you.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.120
And we are in combat order.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.200
Clark Bishop, what do you do?

11:33.200 --> 11:34.520
I want to try and run.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.920
Am I near Drew's body?

11:35.920 --> 11:37.200
If I'm still standing and running,

11:37.200 --> 11:39.280
I would keep running toward it if I am.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.520
Yeah, absolutely.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.900
I want to run toward it and grab it and pick it up

11:42.900 --> 11:45.060
and carry it with me toward Gary.

11:45.060 --> 11:46.200
Okay, done.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.280
You're definitely strong enough to pick up

11:48.280 --> 11:49.720
a little Drew Andrews.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.480
He's, you know, I believe he's got a fair amount of pudge,

11:53.480 --> 11:56.360
but you can definitely throw him up over.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.360
How are you carrying him as you're in?

11:59.360 --> 12:01.440
Remember, as you pick him up,

12:01.440 --> 12:04.720
you're picking up a wet Drew Andrews who's unconscious,

12:04.720 --> 12:07.120
but you know it's not Drew inside.

12:07.120 --> 12:07.960
Sure.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.400
I just want to, if he's laying on the ground,

12:10.400 --> 12:14.200
I want to grab his arms and like drape them over my back.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.120
So his whole body's on my shoulders,

12:17.120 --> 12:19.600
behind my neck on my shoulders.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.480
So I think, is that a fireman's carry?

12:21.480 --> 12:22.600
I think that's a fireman's carry.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.720
I'm doing that.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.820
And not only are you saving him from the fires

12:26.820 --> 12:29.160
of wherever he might, no, there's no.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.640
Hell.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.040
You don't need a fire to have a fireman's carry.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.560
Oh shit, Thomas, thank you so much.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.040
I think legally you do.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.120
I think that this might be an illegal maneuver

12:40.120 --> 12:41.000
performing here.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.280
Well, it's yeah, and it's not like a big thing.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.080
It's just like a, you can't call it champagne thing.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.560
Right, right.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.400
Unjust laws should not be laws.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.760
Keith Vigno, what are you doing?

12:53.760 --> 12:55.560
Well, now hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.020
That protects the valor, like the growers

12:58.020 --> 12:59.740
of the champagne region.

13:00.740 --> 13:01.900
Yeah.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.780
No, it's unjust, it's bullshit.

13:03.780 --> 13:04.620
I don't think so.

13:04.620 --> 13:05.440
Shouldn't exist.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.660
I'm with the farmers.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.060
I stand with the farmers of Champagne, France.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.060
I don't think we've looked into it at all.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.020
They're probably like huge landowners

13:12.020 --> 13:12.940
who don't give a fuck.

13:12.940 --> 13:14.780
Yeah, actually fuck them, you're right.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.020
Yeah, fuck champagne.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.620
Also, it makes my tummy hurt.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.020
Keith Vigno, what are you doing?

13:20.020 --> 13:22.060
Keith is kind of disoriented,

13:22.060 --> 13:26.940
but just is running away from the explosion of the truck.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.660
Well, you landed directly on Jimmy Sanders.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.500
Oh, yeah.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.420
Landed directly on him, and he's like,

13:32.420 --> 13:34.700
number four, just get on top of me with the,

13:34.700 --> 13:35.700
yeah, it's not even.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.700
I stand up and I look at him,

13:37.700 --> 13:40.600
and since I know he's conscious or whatever,

13:40.600 --> 13:42.300
I kind of help him up,

13:42.300 --> 13:44.780
and then I start running towards Gary.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.300
Okay, so as you reach for his hand,

13:47.300 --> 13:50.140
he's only looking past you and behind you

13:50.140 --> 13:52.380
at the ooze that is chasing you.

13:52.380 --> 13:54.340
So you can't run if you want to help him up.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.580
You can only help him up.

13:55.740 --> 13:57.260
Okay, I help him up then.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.680
Oh, well that's very kind of you.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.060
Can all three of us see the ooze currently?

14:01.060 --> 14:01.940
Currently.

14:01.940 --> 14:02.780
Okay.

14:02.780 --> 14:04.540
If Keith is helping Jimmy up

14:04.540 --> 14:06.980
and trying to get him to Gary,

14:06.980 --> 14:08.660
I would like to do the same thing

14:08.660 --> 14:10.480
and aid him and help that be quicker.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.520
Oh, absolutely, then it is done,

14:12.520 --> 14:16.540
and Tyler is immediately just following Clark Bishop.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.420
Tyler is right on the heels of Clark Bishop,

14:21.420 --> 14:24.940
and you are all running toward Gary Daley,

14:25.180 --> 14:27.860
who has popped his head up out of this storm drain

14:27.860 --> 14:30.820
with a beautiful bright yellow shirt

14:30.820 --> 14:32.400
underneath a denim jacket,

14:32.400 --> 14:36.860
which you can only see him from right above the nips up,

14:36.860 --> 14:38.140
because he's hanging up out of here.

14:38.140 --> 14:40.100
I put my arms out in front of the other two,

14:40.100 --> 14:41.620
and I'm like, hold on, fellas,

14:41.620 --> 14:43.920
we ain't got no way of knowing he ain't an it.

14:46.860 --> 14:50.260
An it, an it, an it, it, from the movie It.

14:50.260 --> 14:51.620
Oh, yeah.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.980
Well, he doesn't look like a clown to me.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.980
Are you Gary Daley, or are you an it?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.460
Hurry up and get on down here.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.440
We got me and Gary, and we got some others,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.460
but we're hiding, and we need to save you.

15:03.460 --> 15:04.980
Obviously, Keith, I mean,

15:04.980 --> 15:07.340
Keith needs to get down here, especially.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.180
Why me?

15:08.180 --> 15:09.580
Everybody wants Keith.

15:09.580 --> 15:12.340
Oh, well, yeah, because he, yeah, they're after you.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.780
Gary, tell us something only Gary would know.

15:15.780 --> 15:18.420
I did a magic spell on you to give you luck.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.620
Come on, hurry up.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.980
Yeah, good, that's what I was looking for, all right.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.740
I run towards it, and I kind of like.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.700
Wait, Keith, even if it is Gary,

15:25.700 --> 15:27.780
we don't know what his intentions are anymore.

15:27.780 --> 15:28.620
We've been gone for a while.

15:28.620 --> 15:31.100
It sounds like everybody in town's with this daddy guy.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.660
As he's saying that, I'm slide tackling

15:33.660 --> 15:36.940
like you would on a soccer field down into the storm train.

15:36.940 --> 15:39.860
Oh, hell yeah, do your shorts like balloon up out,

15:39.860 --> 15:42.900
like give you some drag to slow you down

15:42.900 --> 15:44.260
so you can slip in easy?

15:44.260 --> 15:45.100
Yep.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.180
So you can slip in easy.

15:46.180 --> 15:49.660
And as soon as I'm in, I process what Clark just said,

15:49.660 --> 15:51.820
and I look at Gary, I'm like, ugh.

15:51.820 --> 15:56.140
No, it's cool, we're hiding from the FCFC,

15:56.140 --> 15:57.900
they're scary fuckers.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.820
That cane he's just taking over town,

15:59.820 --> 16:02.340
we gotta hide down here, otherwise they'll find us.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.540
And then immediately is like, oh shit,

16:04.540 --> 16:06.860
and closes his eyes with his hand.

16:06.860 --> 16:08.220
Gary, could you see it?

16:08.220 --> 16:10.100
Well, I didn't wanna see it,

16:10.100 --> 16:11.900
because then it'll come.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.420
It comes to those who have seen it?

16:13.420 --> 16:14.940
If you're looking at it, hold on,

16:14.940 --> 16:17.020
get the fuck down here, get on down.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.820
I'm helping Drew down there, I'm getting down in there,

16:18.820 --> 16:21.140
and when I get down in there, I'm picking Drew back up,

16:21.300 --> 16:23.260
getting him just back on my shoulder so that we're mobile.

16:23.260 --> 16:25.860
And Tyler does that adorable thing that dogs do

16:25.860 --> 16:28.260
when they crawl, because it's so cute.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.900
Their paws just kind of move,

16:30.900 --> 16:32.900
and then just jumps down into it.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.180
And once you guys are all down there,

16:35.180 --> 16:37.180
you got Jimmy Sanders down there as well,

16:37.180 --> 16:40.780
and he's just not paying attention to anything.

16:40.780 --> 16:43.900
He immediately just starts stepping into the sewage water.

16:43.900 --> 16:47.780
Basically, I'm seeing it as this tunnel that you're now in.

16:47.780 --> 16:49.140
You gotta walk away on the right,

16:49.140 --> 16:50.940
you gotta walk away on the far left,

16:51.580 --> 16:56.140
you've got a sewage waterway moving slowly

16:56.140 --> 16:57.720
in between the two pathways,

16:57.720 --> 17:02.180
and then we've got an arched tunnel roof made out of stone

17:02.180 --> 17:04.560
that leads off into the darkness ahead,

17:04.560 --> 17:07.300
and you can't see where it leads to.

17:07.300 --> 17:11.540
And Gary looks at John Lee Pettymore the third,

17:11.540 --> 17:16.300
and he's like, you, you're, hi Gary,

17:16.300 --> 17:19.500
this is actually John Lee Pettymore the fourth

17:19.500 --> 17:21.680
in the body of my daddy.

17:22.740 --> 17:26.060
Obviously, that's a lot to take in and a lot to believe,

17:26.060 --> 17:28.340
but I feel like you're seeing the goo monster out there,

17:28.340 --> 17:29.420
and you know what's going on,

17:29.420 --> 17:33.820
so you can probably just move past this, right?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.380
And accept that it's happening.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.220
I don't like that at all,

17:38.220 --> 17:41.700
and I especially don't like that you've, you're dripping.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.060
You know you're dripping, right?

17:43.060 --> 17:45.580
Well, I was in, yeah, dripping water.

17:45.580 --> 17:47.140
No siree.

17:47.420 --> 17:51.420
Your nose, your eyes, your ears, your mouth.

17:51.420 --> 17:52.940
You got the goo coming out of you,

17:52.940 --> 17:54.420
but it doesn't seem to be,

17:55.460 --> 17:57.740
it's like small enough to not be at,

17:57.740 --> 18:00.180
and he like, he wants to poke at it,

18:00.180 --> 18:01.980
but he's not quite poking at it,

18:01.980 --> 18:04.260
and he's like, honestly, if I could just not look at you,

18:04.260 --> 18:06.780
that would be for the best for me personally,

18:06.780 --> 18:09.640
because I am, and he's rubbing his fingers

18:09.640 --> 18:11.340
against his other fingers,

18:11.340 --> 18:13.380
and he starts looking at his hands,

18:13.380 --> 18:14.660
and he's like, yep.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.220
All right, you're dripping.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.740
Yep, just a little bit, just enough.

18:18.740 --> 18:21.500
Yeah, does that allow you to see the goo?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.340
Yep.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.220
Oh, interesting.

18:23.220 --> 18:24.300
I was gonna clarify,

18:24.300 --> 18:25.540
when he was talking about the dripping,

18:25.540 --> 18:26.540
we didn't see it, right?

18:26.540 --> 18:28.900
No, am I the only one you see it coming out of?

18:28.900 --> 18:30.540
And he looks at the rest of you,

18:30.540 --> 18:32.860
and he really avoids eye contact

18:32.860 --> 18:34.860
with John Lee Pettymore III from here on out,

18:34.860 --> 18:36.300
and he's like, okay, so,

18:36.300 --> 18:39.540
and he kind of puts his hand up over your face,

18:39.540 --> 18:43.180
and he's like, okay, so you are the missing

18:43.180 --> 18:48.180
John Lee Pettymore III, who inside of you

18:48.260 --> 18:51.220
is our John Lee Pettymore, who's been around,

18:51.220 --> 18:54.300
and do I have all that right?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.060
I nod at him and confirm.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.980
More or less, yes.

18:57.980 --> 18:59.460
Yeah, Gary, he's telling the truth.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.460
But, Clark Bishop, you're not like

19:01.460 --> 19:03.460
your parents aren't inside of you?

19:03.460 --> 19:05.540
Nope, I'm 100% Clark right now.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.740
No, but he does have his own fun thing

19:07.740 --> 19:11.080
with vis-a-vis an older, you know,

19:11.120 --> 19:13.440
I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's kooky.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.180
What's his reaction to that?

19:15.180 --> 19:16.480
I have a human of 30.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.800
Can I see if I catch anything in his face?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.040
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.560
I rolled a six.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.920
Oh, shit, yeah.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.860
No, giving him that much information

19:26.860 --> 19:30.640
about old Clark Bishop, you don't notice anything.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.100
Okay.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.880
Gary, I'm still me, I'm still Keith.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.240
And Drew is actually Kerry Pages.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.440
Oh, yeah, when you were asking about that.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.240
Fuck, yeah, we forgot to mention that.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.420
I'm sorry, what?

19:45.420 --> 19:47.600
John Three's actually John Four.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.160
Me and Clark are who we are,

19:50.160 --> 19:52.840
and Drew is Kerry inside of Drew's body.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.080
Yep, he's got it right.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.120
And I don't mean to be rude,

19:56.120 --> 19:58.040
and he starts petting Tyler,

19:58.040 --> 20:00.200
and he's like, who are you, my little fella?

20:00.200 --> 20:03.340
This is Kerry Pages' dog, Tyler.

20:03.340 --> 20:06.320
And Tyler is being very attentive

20:06.320 --> 20:09.760
to the body of Drew Andrews,

20:09.760 --> 20:12.200
which is still being held by Clark Bishop.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.160
Yeah, see how it's focused on Drew there?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.440
I think it's because it's,

20:15.440 --> 20:20.440
well, Drew has the soul, or the mind, or presence,

20:20.940 --> 20:22.440
however you want to define it,

20:22.440 --> 20:24.040
of Councilwoman Kerry Pages,

20:24.040 --> 20:25.200
because of the church. Or the baguette.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.320
You know, it might be the baguette that he's got,

20:27.320 --> 20:30.000
because, you know, it's a long, long baguette,

20:30.000 --> 20:31.500
but you gotta cut it in thirds

20:31.500 --> 20:33.860
in order to make an eight-inch sandwich,

20:33.860 --> 20:35.480
which is what you're gonna wanna get.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.080
Yeah, and Jimmy's just, he's not right right now, so.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.440
But he is Jimmy.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.240
What's going on with the pastor and everything in town?

20:44.240 --> 20:45.760
We've just got back to town,

20:45.760 --> 20:47.800
already seen some weird shit

20:47.800 --> 20:50.280
that I can't make complete sense of yet.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.940
What are you doing down here, even?

20:51.940 --> 20:54.000
Gary Daley flips a Zippo,

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
and you see his very brightly colored yellow button down.

20:59.660 --> 21:01.920
He's got a denim jacket over the top of it,

21:01.920 --> 21:03.800
and he's like,

21:03.800 --> 21:07.120
I have been hoping that you guys would come back

21:08.040 --> 21:09.720
ever since yesterday.

21:09.720 --> 21:11.200
What happened yesterday?

21:11.200 --> 21:14.660
Everything went to shit.

21:15.680 --> 21:20.160
We're down here hiding because that crazy lunatic

21:20.160 --> 21:25.160
put up a wall of water and fish around the church,

21:25.160 --> 21:28.280
and has taken to calling himself Daddy,

21:28.280 --> 21:30.420
and he has held them all convinced

21:30.420 --> 21:32.440
that he can go back in time

21:32.440 --> 21:34.500
as long as he can get Keith Vick.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.800
You guys are looking at me like you already know all this.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.960
Well, we've seen the wall.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.160
Yeah, we've heard all that.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.560
I mean, as soon as that went up,

21:41.560 --> 21:42.920
he got a lot of followers,

21:42.920 --> 21:46.400
and he's been interpreting people's dreams,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.280
and they've just been following him

21:48.280 --> 21:49.880
to the end of the earth, basically,

21:49.880 --> 21:51.320
and they'll do whatever he wants.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.480
Do you know exactly what he wants with me?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.800
I just know that he thinks that he needs you

21:56.800 --> 21:58.760
to go back in time somehow.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.420
Okay.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.340
Well, I'm not really trying to help him out.

22:03.340 --> 22:04.900
Are you guys on the internet?

22:04.900 --> 22:06.780
Just a crazy question,

22:06.780 --> 22:08.860
but you don't strike me as people

22:08.860 --> 22:11.140
who have a lot of points in computer science.

22:11.140 --> 22:12.460
Heh heh heh.

22:12.460 --> 22:15.020
Uh, weird way to put it,

22:15.020 --> 22:18.480
but I would say I took a class in high school.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.740
I have email.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.340
I have email.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.100
I've got a Facebook.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.660
I've got a telephone at the house.

22:25.660 --> 22:27.500
I could maybe call somebody.

22:27.500 --> 22:32.500
So I found a website, a blog post from Harold Dorsey

22:32.660 --> 22:34.860
that got wiped off the internet.

22:34.860 --> 22:35.980
Nobody could've found it

22:35.980 --> 22:37.940
if you just would've Googled around.

22:37.940 --> 22:38.820
It got wiped.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.060
Somebody took it off, but...

22:40.060 --> 22:41.380
What'd it say?

22:41.380 --> 22:42.820
See for yourself.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.340
And Gary Daley holds up a phone.

22:46.340 --> 22:50.020
He's got a screenshot of this blog.

22:50.020 --> 22:55.020
So you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.060
Okay.

22:57.500 --> 23:01.260
Holy shit.

23:01.260 --> 23:02.860
Okay, woo.

23:02.860 --> 23:04.200
So for the listeners out there,

23:04.200 --> 23:07.940
you can go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com.

23:07.940 --> 23:09.900
Dorsey is D-O-R-S-E-Y,

23:09.900 --> 23:14.900
and Harold is and always was H-A-R-R-E-L-L.

23:17.260 --> 23:19.420
People were talking like it was Harold.

23:19.420 --> 23:20.460
It was never Harold.

23:20.460 --> 23:21.860
Yeah, cause that's a name

23:23.380 --> 23:24.860
that people are familiar with.

23:24.860 --> 23:25.700
Yeah.

23:27.060 --> 23:30.820
Zach says it was set up in May, 2017.

23:30.820 --> 23:33.900
Did you really register a blogger account

23:33.900 --> 23:35.680
three years ago for this campaign?

23:35.680 --> 23:36.540
Yeah.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.380
That's dope.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.220
Wow.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.020
Did you just know you wanted to do something like this

23:40.020 --> 23:42.500
or did you actually set one up for Harold Dorsey?

23:43.400 --> 23:44.780
It was for Harold Dorsey.

23:44.780 --> 23:45.620
That's dope.

23:45.620 --> 23:46.520
This is dope as fuck.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.800
Okay, so for those of you who are driving

23:49.800 --> 23:51.020
or doing the dishes

23:51.020 --> 23:53.680
or you're wearing AirPods and you're pooping

23:53.680 --> 23:55.800
and your phone is in the other room,

23:55.800 --> 23:59.000
if you go to what'sbehinddorsey.blogspot.com,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.780
you'll find a blog that is entitled

24:01.780 --> 24:03.500
What's Behind Dorsey?

24:03.500 --> 24:06.920
A True Story in a False City.

24:06.920 --> 24:11.920
And there is a single blog posted on Monday, December 3rd,

24:11.960 --> 24:16.960
and it is entitled Operation San Ferra Blum

24:17.000 --> 24:20.760
and a Rogue Police Chief in Contention.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.960
Followers of my story know I am not afraid

24:23.960 --> 24:25.440
of rocking the boat.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.120
I was fired from the city star

24:27.120 --> 24:29.560
for threatening to self-publish my expose

24:29.560 --> 24:31.040
on the glass crime family

24:31.040 --> 24:34.120
after a blasphemous night of depravity

24:34.120 --> 24:37.540
undercover at the glass compound's robot-inclusive

24:37.540 --> 24:40.760
fight club called the Scrap Pit.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.920
Lots of people know about the Scrap Pit.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.680
The real party, for those in the know,

24:45.680 --> 24:48.720
is even more indescribably profane,

24:48.720 --> 24:53.360
a room filled with city officials, judges, politicians,

24:53.360 --> 24:57.640
celebrities lovingly referred to by its patrons

24:57.640 --> 25:00.460
as the Den of Sin.

25:00.460 --> 25:04.040
The Den of Sin offers more than just bloodsport.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.960
It is torture.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.720
Malnourished preteens are trapped in a hanging cage,

25:09.720 --> 25:11.800
forced to fight to the death

25:11.800 --> 25:16.720
as the ceiling lowers to meet the floor slowly but steadily.

25:16.720 --> 25:20.600
In one such match, I witness the two gaunt children

25:20.600 --> 25:24.460
hold hands in solidarity with each other,

25:24.460 --> 25:27.040
accepting their demise.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.700
The offended roar of the booing crowd

25:29.700 --> 25:32.680
was quickly replaced with lustful cheers

25:32.680 --> 25:36.720
as the hanging cage performed its singular trick

25:36.720 --> 25:40.240
like a French press or a citrus juicer.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.680
The Den of Sin earned its name

25:42.680 --> 25:46.200
as the congregation of monsters flocked

25:46.640 --> 25:49.800
to the metallic smelling dark red waterfall.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.200
Well, I've somehow survived that mess.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.380
A target on my back, sure, but that's just business.

25:56.380 --> 26:01.000
However, I feel curiously out of my depth on this new case.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.120
Most of us don't think about the small town of contention

26:04.120 --> 26:06.240
about an hour west of here,

26:06.240 --> 26:09.520
but it is recently proven we should pay attention.

26:09.520 --> 26:13.440
By now, you may have heard about some of the disappearances

26:13.440 --> 26:15.720
and the animal-filled creeks,

26:15.760 --> 26:17.440
but what you may not know

26:17.440 --> 26:21.440
is the chief of police recently contacted me, quote,

26:21.440 --> 26:26.440
to open up the eyes and minds of those who live in the city.

26:26.920 --> 26:31.140
She asked if I knew anything about the circle of knowledge,

26:31.140 --> 26:33.760
Operation Sanfera Blum,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.680
or the flowers that make their home

26:35.680 --> 26:38.480
all over our downtown here in the city.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.280
She asked if I knew anything about BarCorp,

26:41.280 --> 26:44.360
its subsidiaries, or the Shell Corporation,

26:44.360 --> 26:46.920
which owns the company, which owns the company,

26:46.920 --> 26:50.480
which owns the company, which owns BarCorp.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.640
She asked if I knew anything about the mill

26:52.640 --> 26:54.720
on the other side of the city,

26:54.720 --> 26:58.520
and she asked if I knew her father, Jim Cook.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.560
So I began digging,

27:00.560 --> 27:03.640
and I began following Jim Cook around the city.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.840
That man can spot a tail,

27:05.840 --> 27:07.520
but he couldn't spot whoever it was

27:07.520 --> 27:10.320
that caught him in an alley two nights ago.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.480
I'm worried I am next.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.320
I'm even more worried that Maggie Cook

27:14.320 --> 27:17.680
is now too spooked to speak on the record.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.920
Chief Maggie Cook was passionate,

27:20.920 --> 27:23.440
irate, and eager,

27:23.440 --> 27:26.320
and then nothing.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.880
We were supposed to meet in person last night,

27:28.880 --> 27:31.840
December 2nd, no word.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.440
I received a message this morning

27:33.440 --> 27:36.960
changing the time and location of our meeting.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.880
If I don't update the blog by tonight,

27:39.880 --> 27:42.360
please begin the search by questioning

27:42.360 --> 27:45.720
Contention Chief of Police, Maggie Cook.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.240
So you guys' eyes look back up,

27:51.240 --> 27:53.160
and Gary Daley's just like,

27:54.960 --> 27:59.480
what the fuck does that mean?

27:59.480 --> 28:01.480
I read this, and I was like, what?

28:01.480 --> 28:05.200
Which part confuses you more,

28:05.200 --> 28:08.240
the Denison stuff or the Maggie stuff?

28:08.240 --> 28:12.400
Well, I assume that the city gets up to some weird stuff,

28:12.400 --> 28:14.200
but here in Contention,

28:14.200 --> 28:16.160
to have her connected to all those things

28:16.160 --> 28:19.120
that it was talking about in here, I don't know.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.680
No, we can pretty much tell you that,

28:21.680 --> 28:26.560
yeah, that's all basically true.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.920
What Maggie's involved in,

28:27.920 --> 28:31.680
it goes way farther than Contention itself.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.520
Guys, what is, like with the flowers

28:35.520 --> 28:37.880
and all that in his blog post,

28:38.880 --> 28:41.920
one of those myriad creatures was hollering at us

28:41.920 --> 28:45.120
about that Samfaro Blom, I don't...

28:45.120 --> 28:46.680
Keith, you pretended to know what it was,

28:46.680 --> 28:47.880
and we didn't know what it was.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.600
Clark, you've kind of been in touch with Maggie,

28:50.600 --> 28:51.880
haven't you?

28:51.880 --> 28:53.080
Yeah, yeah.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.400
Has she said anything about her dad, or?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.880
I mean, she showed me around her dad's house.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.360
I was holding his book when she found me.

29:00.360 --> 29:03.000
She asked why I was searching through her daddy's book.

29:03.000 --> 29:03.840
I remember that.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.160
She hasn't said much about Jim himself,

29:07.560 --> 29:08.840
but just the stuff that we found

29:08.840 --> 29:12.600
putting dots together in the carkled hole.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.440
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.240
It's just odd that he was following Jim around

29:17.240 --> 29:20.440
and that Maggie said to open up the eyes of the city.

29:20.440 --> 29:20.840
It just...

29:22.200 --> 29:26.360
You know this bit here about Jim dying in an alley

29:26.360 --> 29:27.560
two nights before?

29:27.560 --> 29:28.060
Yeah.

29:28.680 --> 29:32.440
We just found out, I believe it was his birthday,

29:32.440 --> 29:34.360
December 1st, and every birthday,

29:34.360 --> 29:36.680
he goes to that pie hole in the city.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
So there's a chance we could figure out

29:38.760 --> 29:41.160
if there's footage in the alley back there,

29:41.160 --> 29:44.040
we might be able to see who got him.

29:44.040 --> 29:44.760
That's true.

29:44.760 --> 29:45.560
It's a great lead.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.240
Well, I mean, what can we do?

29:49.240 --> 29:51.720
Can we do anything with this information right now?

29:51.720 --> 29:54.600
So it lines up with everything we've been kind of thinking, right?

29:54.600 --> 29:58.200
That Jim Cook, he mentioned in that note

29:58.200 --> 29:59.640
that he knew he had a tail.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.200
It was a round face man with glasses or something like that,

30:02.200 --> 30:04.840
which we all kind of at the time thought it was Harold.

30:04.840 --> 30:05.880
So we figured that out.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.680
Maggie was turning on Jim.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.480
Maggie was spilling secrets to Harold about Jim.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.240
That's what we've gathered from this.

30:13.240 --> 30:13.640
Yeah.

30:13.640 --> 30:18.600
Oh, and it said that she changed the time and location of their meeting.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.240
They must have changed it to her house.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.040
She changed it to her house from somewhere else, correct?

30:25.320 --> 30:26.840
That's where you found Harold, right?

30:26.840 --> 30:29.080
Harold was at Maggie's house.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.440
And I couldn't save him.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.600
He got a text that sent him to Maggie's house

30:32.600 --> 30:35.240
instead of some other meeting place that they were going to meet.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.680
I don't know what to do with that information,

30:36.680 --> 30:38.440
but that's what I'm gathering here now.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.320
Well, I mean, before we got down here,

30:41.320 --> 30:43.320
we were kind of on our way to Maggie's house.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.520
Yeah, we kind of were.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.320
Yeah, Maggie's house is right on Bean's pond.

30:47.320 --> 30:50.920
Do you think you could get us to the pond through these tunnels?

30:50.920 --> 30:51.800
Well, yeah.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.280
I can get you anywhere you want, basically.

30:54.280 --> 30:58.680
Contingent is a mining town.

30:58.680 --> 31:02.760
And they basically, when the mine shored up,

31:02.760 --> 31:04.360
they took all the old tunnels

31:04.360 --> 31:06.200
that they were using to get around,

31:06.200 --> 31:07.720
and they bricked them all up

31:07.720 --> 31:11.000
and made a very, very modern sewage system.

31:11.560 --> 31:15.320
And so we can get pretty much anywhere we want around here

31:15.320 --> 31:17.080
through them tunnels about there.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.520
Well, we've been trying to get to the pond for a little while.

31:20.520 --> 31:21.640
Like Ninja Turtles.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.360
I'm Raphael, obviously.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.680
Of course, of course.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.760
You're whichever turtle you need to be.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.520
So you're walking south through this tunnel for about five minutes

31:32.520 --> 31:35.160
before you make it to an underground chamber

31:35.160 --> 31:40.040
where Gary Daley and Harry Klinker have set up a makeshift campsite.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.640
This room is square and roughly 30 yards across,

31:44.200 --> 31:48.920
with four concrete columns placed evenly about 10 yards from each other.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.480
The ground is mostly dry,

31:51.480 --> 31:53.240
though there are puddles scattered about

31:53.240 --> 31:56.120
where the concrete floor has eroded away a bit.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.800
There are two tents on opposite ends of the room

31:59.880 --> 32:03.320
and a luminous camping lantern lighting your view

32:03.320 --> 32:05.000
from the very, very center of the room.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.880
There is slight commotion by the far tent as you enter this space.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.560
Mildred Mitchell, upon seeing your group,

32:13.560 --> 32:18.360
is fleeing into the portable canvas shelter and zipping up the flap.

32:18.920 --> 32:25.320
As a woman you do not recognize questions her from outside the outdoor domicile.

32:25.320 --> 32:30.520
And you would remember Mildred Mitchell is the grandma of Toby B. Mitchell

32:30.520 --> 32:33.160
who lived across from John Peters,

32:33.160 --> 32:38.440
who I believe called in to say that John Peters' door was swinging open

32:38.440 --> 32:41.400
and his mail was piling up in the first episode.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.840
And just to remind listeners,

32:44.840 --> 32:46.920
what is the significance of all that,

32:46.920 --> 32:50.440
and could you tie any loose ends together there?

32:50.440 --> 32:56.440
So you see her hop into this tent and a woman you don't recognize

32:56.440 --> 32:58.280
is on the outside kind of questioning her,

32:58.280 --> 33:04.600
but closer to you you see a man sitting up against one of the concrete columns reading a book.

33:04.600 --> 33:11.160
And you recognize him as Casey Kristoff, the janitor of the First Church of Contention.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.320
He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.360
His beer gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt

33:18.440 --> 33:20.680
and over his cutoff shorts,

33:20.680 --> 33:24.840
which has been his outfit of choice for the past 30 years.

33:25.560 --> 33:31.080
Thanks to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City for Casey Kristoff.

33:31.080 --> 33:35.400
You too can create an NPC in location that might get used in the show

33:35.400 --> 33:41.320
if you support us on Patreon at the $10 level of the contention citizens or higher.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.600
And then you see Harry Klinker sitting outside the nearest tent.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.560
And as soon as you guys walk in there he stands up.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.000
He's clearly relieved.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.760
He's all over his face when he sees Gary in there with you guys.

33:52.760 --> 33:56.520
And you all enter into this underground temporary home.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.080
You should disconnect and reconnect.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.520
I didn't want to stop your flow, but you're a super robot.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.760
Like right as you started that you went super robot.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.840
I will give it a go.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.600
Okay, so how many tents are there?

34:09.400 --> 34:10.040
Just one?

34:10.040 --> 34:11.880
I think just one that she ran into.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.520
Am I still a robot?

34:14.520 --> 34:15.240
You're back!

34:15.240 --> 34:16.200
Keep talking.

34:16.200 --> 34:19.000
Am I still a robot with my mouth in my words?

34:19.000 --> 34:22.360
Because when I talk I don't lightly swerve.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.200
I swerve hard to the right.

34:24.200 --> 34:25.960
Then I keep that shit up.

34:25.960 --> 34:29.000
And I go in circles till I throw up.

34:30.120 --> 34:30.620
Nice.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.080
You ran up with up, but yeah.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.320
Okay, so two tents.

34:37.320 --> 34:40.680
One across the room from you where Mildred Mitchell hopped into.

34:40.680 --> 34:42.920
And there was a woman standing outside.

34:42.920 --> 34:45.960
And the other tent where Harry Klinker is sitting outside of.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.280
He stood up to greet you as you walked in.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.640
Hey boys, oh my god.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.480
It's been a crazy couple days, no see.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.280
It's good to see you.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.840
Sorry, the other guy's name was Kristoff what?

34:54.840 --> 34:56.040
Casey Kristoff.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.560
Casey Kristoff, okay, sorry.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.240
Oh my god, yes Harry.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.360
I found them.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.480
They were just, they were out there.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.040
They'd wrecked and I mean it was coming for them.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.480
Goo was coming for them, you know.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.360
And thankfully they're here and we're fine.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.000
I showed them the Dorsey block spot.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.640
And yeah, we're just, oh boy.

35:13.640 --> 35:17.800
So is this your guys' like home base down here or?

35:17.800 --> 35:22.280
Yeah, we've been trying to hide from that old Pastor Adam Kane.

35:22.280 --> 35:27.880
Really, really is not being very good to the people, you know.

35:27.880 --> 35:33.800
Yeah, how many people do you think he's got on his side up there?

35:33.800 --> 35:34.760
God, I don't know.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.400
Maybe, maybe a hundred.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.000
And what about you guys down here?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.600
Is this all of us?

35:40.600 --> 35:47.400
And Harry and Gary kind of look back at the three individuals down here,

35:47.400 --> 35:48.760
one of which is hiding in a tent.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.240
Yeah, this is, this is us.

35:51.880 --> 35:56.520
I mean for now, we did have, we have a code outside of clinkers, you know.

35:57.080 --> 36:00.680
If people can read it, it says tunnels and they can get down here.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.120
What sort of code?

36:02.120 --> 36:04.280
Well, it's a pretty fun code.

36:04.280 --> 36:07.000
I just mean how do you keep bad folks from reading it?

36:07.000 --> 36:11.480
They both look at each other and furrow their brows with like a panicked look.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.760
So I, I recognize most of you down here.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.040
Who, who's that?

36:18.040 --> 36:21.880
And I kind of tilt my head at the lady I don't recognize.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.080
Oh, that's Clara.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.120
She's from the city.

36:24.120 --> 36:29.000
How, how'd she get hooked up in this mess?

36:29.000 --> 36:32.760
No, I mean you can ask her yourself, but she had some friends in contention.

36:32.760 --> 36:36.280
She was hanging out with when all this started and she kind of got stuck here.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.920
Where her, where her friends at?

36:38.920 --> 36:43.320
Unfortunately, they, they got lost to, you know, Kane's movement.

36:43.320 --> 36:44.360
Clara, Clara.

36:44.360 --> 36:53.000
This attractive woman in her mid-40s looks over at you guys and she's got large tortoiseshell glasses

36:53.000 --> 37:01.080
and as she walks up, you see that she has blood red lipstick and even though it's freezing cold

37:01.080 --> 37:07.000
outside, she is wearing a sleeveless shirt and you see a full sleeve tattoo.

37:07.560 --> 37:12.680
And the tattoo is of a robed figure holding a ball of light.

37:14.200 --> 37:21.000
Clara Blankenship was created by Annie Beat, another citizen of contention over on the Patreon.

37:21.000 --> 37:21.560
Super cool.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.840
Annie, you are okay.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.960
When I see her tattoo, I kind of look at the other two officers and

37:29.960 --> 37:31.480
like kind of wide-eyed.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.240
I, I wide-eyed back.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.720
Guys, it's the cover of Led Zeppelin IV.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.720
Doesn't that have a guy with sticks on it?

37:40.280 --> 37:42.680
Did you guys just call me over here for-

37:42.680 --> 37:43.320
Uh, yeah.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.560
Hold on, I'm googling that.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.920
What's, what's your deal, Clara?

37:53.720 --> 37:56.520
That's a real interesting tattoo you got there.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.360
Is that from any kind of Zeppelin album?

37:58.760 --> 38:02.200
You know that Stairway to Heaven poster with the guy on the road with the light?

38:02.200 --> 38:06.040
No, this is, this is based off a dream I had a few years ago.

38:06.040 --> 38:06.920
About Zeppelin?

38:06.920 --> 38:09.160
You guys have been having these crazy dreams, right?

38:09.160 --> 38:13.480
I mean, I've been talking to everyone about him and we all seem to be having these absurd

38:13.480 --> 38:13.960
dreams.

38:13.960 --> 38:19.480
See, back then, this dream, it was just this, this robed figure with this ball of light

38:19.480 --> 38:24.040
and he was walking just a long path and he was carrying this ball of light.

38:24.040 --> 38:28.200
But recently, I've been having this dream where he's pulling the ball of light out of

38:28.200 --> 38:29.000
a television?

38:29.560 --> 38:34.760
It's, it's so weird because before, it was as if there was, you know, it was like all

38:34.760 --> 38:38.840
dirt and stuff, so I didn't really expect technology to be a part of these dreams, but

38:38.840 --> 38:42.120
you know, some people are having dreams that are in the modern world, some in the future

38:42.120 --> 38:46.440
even, and you know, it's, it's just, have you, what are the dreams you, I assume you

38:46.440 --> 38:47.320
guys have been having dreams.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.520
How long have you been in contingent?

38:48.520 --> 38:51.320
Just like out of that, that book, isn't it?

38:51.320 --> 38:51.800
The book?

38:51.800 --> 38:52.280
Which book?

38:52.280 --> 38:53.560
I study a lot of occult books.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.080
Is there a specific book you're talking about?

38:55.080 --> 38:56.680
Looking at the two officers.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.200
It's, it's similar for sure.

38:58.200 --> 39:02.040
The, the, the thing we saw though, had the light emitting from a mouth.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.120
It wasn't being held like an orb.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.160
It's odd, but you've been having dreams about this.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.720
I mean, everybody has weird dreams.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.520
Harry over there told us you were in town visiting some friends.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.400
Who were you visiting?

39:13.400 --> 39:14.520
The Dudley's?

39:14.520 --> 39:15.720
Just some friends of mine.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.920
They were, unfortunately, they were persuaded.

39:18.920 --> 39:24.920
They, see, they, they lost their cat to all this mess and unfortunately when, when they

39:24.920 --> 39:30.360
were promised an option to, I don't know if you've heard, the pastor is saying he

39:30.360 --> 39:32.840
can turn back time if you follow him.

39:32.840 --> 39:36.680
So, you know, they, they really want their cat back.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.720
They think that's the only way to...

39:37.720 --> 39:41.320
Their cat's probably just in the river there with all the other cats and dogs.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.960
Have we encountered the Dudley's before or is this new?

39:43.960 --> 39:45.800
Uh, you would know, there's just some...

39:45.800 --> 39:47.800
But we haven't like ran into them.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.920
Not in the podcast, no.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.760
They're just contention citizens.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.040
Did you tell them to check the river?

39:52.040 --> 39:53.960
That's where a lot of them are ending up.

39:53.960 --> 39:59.800
Well, see, the issue is, is that yesterday the, the rivers were all emptied.

39:59.800 --> 40:05.960
Uh, both the creek, the pond, everything was emptied by the collectors.

40:05.960 --> 40:11.720
So they took all the animals back to the FCFC, which is what they're calling this bullshit

40:11.720 --> 40:11.960
now.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.560
Did they get their cat back then?

40:13.560 --> 40:14.040
I don't know.

40:14.040 --> 40:14.920
I haven't seen him since.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.440
I'm not going behind that fish wall.

40:16.440 --> 40:17.640
Are you kidding me?

40:17.640 --> 40:18.840
Have you seen that shit?

40:18.840 --> 40:20.840
I've got to let Murphy in real quick.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.840
He's got to go behind the fish wall to get Murphy.

40:23.960 --> 40:39.720
Gary and Harry, I mean, we were, uh, about to go investigate the pond.

40:39.720 --> 40:43.880
Uh, I think there might be something at the bottom of it, but Claire, you said that all

40:43.880 --> 40:45.240
the water got drained out of it.

40:45.240 --> 40:45.960
Is that right?

40:45.960 --> 40:46.440
Yeah.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.640
I don't know how they did it.

40:47.640 --> 40:54.200
I also don't know how there's a floating, like, wall of water surrounding the entire

40:54.200 --> 40:55.080
campus of the church.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.720
Well, I'm sure there's a solid explanation for it, and that's kind of what we're trying

40:59.720 --> 40:59.880
to get to the bottom of.

40:59.880 --> 41:06.120
I'm the head archivist and director of the City County Historical Commission, and I've

41:06.120 --> 41:11.080
worked there for about 18 years, and I don't know if you've studied much history, but I

41:11.080 --> 41:13.480
certainly, sorry, this kind of sounds like I'm being a dick.

41:13.480 --> 41:18.280
I'm really trying not to be, but historically speaking, I don't remember this ever happening.

41:18.280 --> 41:21.640
Yeah, but I mean, like, they do this kind of stuff all the time in Vegas.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.200
Oh.

41:22.200 --> 41:22.920
Bellagio.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.480
It's a Bellagio sort of situation, I'd imagine.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.520
Does the water normally stay up the whole time?

41:28.520 --> 41:30.680
With lights and mirrors, yeah.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.400
Magnets.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.120
Wow.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.040
I guess I need to go to Las Vegas then.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.600
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

41:36.600 --> 41:40.440
Hey, Zach, when you were describing Casey, and you said he was a janitor of the church,

41:40.440 --> 41:41.960
do we know that in character?

41:41.960 --> 41:44.120
Yeah, you would know that he's the janitor, yeah.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.640
He's been the janitor for years.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.200
I'd like to go over, talk to him too, if you want.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.200
Okay, roll a humant for me right off the bat.

41:50.200 --> 41:50.840
Can I help?

41:50.840 --> 41:52.200
Are you all going over?

41:52.200 --> 41:53.080
Yeah, I'm gonna go with him.

41:54.040 --> 41:54.920
We'll bring Clara and Harry and Gary.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.920
I mean, you don't have to disengage with Clara, I was just saying.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.520
We'll call him over to us, I guess.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.000
Uh, I failed.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.360
A 92 on a 30.

42:02.360 --> 42:04.520
37 on a 80.

42:05.240 --> 42:05.960
Yeah, they'll do it.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.120
He's not reading right now.

42:08.920 --> 42:15.160
He's listening in, and he was very intrigued when this group of people walked in.

42:15.160 --> 42:19.000
Also, Clark, what did you do with the body of Drew Carey?

42:19.000 --> 42:20.120
I'm probably still holding it.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.360
He's still over the top?

42:22.360 --> 42:27.480
Okay, so Tyler's back paws are just like, his front paws are on your back,

42:27.480 --> 42:30.760
and he's just like sniffing at Drew Carey this whole time,

42:30.760 --> 42:36.520
and Jimmy Sanders is just like wandering kind of in circles around the room mumbling to himself.

42:36.920 --> 42:41.240
I want to set Drew up against a pillar, and I don't know if it's a roll or not,

42:41.240 --> 42:42.840
but try and see if I can revive.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.000
Yeah, go ahead and roll first aid.

42:48.920 --> 42:49.560
I pass.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.480
A four on a 30.

42:51.480 --> 42:57.400
Oh, yeah, I've got some smelling salts actually here for you there, Clark.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.080
That's exactly what I could use, thank you.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.600
Yeah, I was gonna ask, but I thought that that would be odd.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.440
Yeah, just a passed roll.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.600
You know, opens up all sorts of doors.

43:14.520 --> 43:15.560
Carey, you with us?

43:15.560 --> 43:16.040
You with us?

43:16.040 --> 43:16.760
Yeah, hey.

43:17.400 --> 43:24.840
And then just staring up at you and staring all around this room, Drew Carey is confused.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.480
Carey, we died in the car crash and we're in hell.

43:29.080 --> 43:33.000
We dragged you down here with us, and we turned Tyler into a hell dog,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.360
and it's gonna nibble at your feet for all of eternity.

43:39.080 --> 43:46.760
Tyler's just like licking Drew Carey's, you know, face and feet back and forth.

43:46.760 --> 43:48.440
There's more where that came from.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.960
Oh, hey there, Tyler.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.160
Oh my God, it's so good.

43:51.720 --> 43:55.240
And Drew starts crying, and it's just like, thank you.

43:55.240 --> 43:58.520
Oh my God, thank you so much for keeping him safe.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.280
I lead the dog off.

44:00.280 --> 44:02.840
If you don't mind, I'd just like to talk to my dog, please.

44:02.840 --> 44:03.720
Thank you very much.

44:03.720 --> 44:06.280
You can talk to Tyler after you answer some of our questions.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.400
Boys, can you help me out here?

44:09.320 --> 44:10.120
Tyler, shut up.

44:10.120 --> 44:10.520
Tyler!

44:19.240 --> 44:24.760
If you're listening, write in an NPC with like special powers and they can help us.

44:24.760 --> 44:32.600
This is Bubba Jenkins and he knows everything.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.680
You can ask him anything and he knows the answer.

44:36.840 --> 44:43.240
Clara Blankenship, this NPC from Annie B was the first NPC sent in.

44:44.120 --> 44:52.200
And I believe in the description, it did say that she owns all of Silas Cole's journals.

44:54.840 --> 44:56.360
Okay, so she was trying to help us.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.040
She literally did exactly that.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.520
That's great.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.320
That's really funny.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.080
Was the tattoo written in on there too?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.360
The tattoo was on there, yeah.

45:06.360 --> 45:06.760
Cool.

45:06.760 --> 45:07.240
I love it.

45:13.640 --> 45:14.840
Oh, who's a good boy?

45:14.840 --> 45:15.640
Who's a good boy?

45:15.640 --> 45:16.840
I love you, Tyler.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.920
Carrie, you took a big hit back there.

45:18.920 --> 45:20.600
Are you feeling all right?

45:20.600 --> 45:23.480
No, not at all, but it doesn't even matter.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.280
Everything is fine.

45:24.280 --> 45:24.760
Thank you.

45:25.320 --> 45:29.560
Now that the love of my life is here with me and everything is fine.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.080
Your original mission was to bring us back to the church, is that right?

45:33.080 --> 45:33.480
Yes.

45:33.480 --> 45:37.960
And was that with the explicit purpose of getting Keith back to the church or was it

45:37.960 --> 45:39.240
all three of us at that point?

45:39.240 --> 45:44.680
Well, I mean, he doesn't want you alive, Clark.

45:44.680 --> 45:50.520
And John, even though you're not technically John, I believe, thank you very much.

45:50.520 --> 45:55.240
I think that, you know, you're John inside of your dad and that's fine.

45:55.240 --> 46:01.160
But you two, you three technically are responsible for the death of his family.

46:01.880 --> 46:06.680
I don't know if you were aware of that when you just crashed a car and then bailed out

46:06.680 --> 46:07.800
of our town.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.000
That's not what happened.

46:09.000 --> 46:17.160
We told a very reliable canine entity to tell the town people what was going on while we

46:17.160 --> 46:17.640
were gone.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.240
Now, if that didn't get communicated to the town, I'm sorry.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.480
I'm sorry, but we sent it into the station.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.960
You think I don't listen to 694.2?

46:25.960 --> 46:26.920
Have you heard Kudzu?

46:30.680 --> 46:32.280
That new song is a real banger.

46:33.160 --> 46:36.440
I just played this morning for the first time and it blew me away.

46:36.440 --> 46:41.080
Okay, well, Kerry, we might have you just stay here until we go to the-

46:41.080 --> 46:42.520
Why do you keep calling him Kerry?

46:42.520 --> 46:49.800
That's Councilwoman Kerry Pages who used the magic slash haunted radio to swap bodies

46:50.760 --> 46:53.800
with our good friend, Ru.

46:53.800 --> 46:57.880
I don't know who you guys are all looking at, but all of their eyes are very wide right

46:57.880 --> 46:58.380
now.

47:00.200 --> 47:06.680
She's been working with a pastor trying to trick us into going back to the church, but

47:06.680 --> 47:08.200
we figured her out.

47:08.200 --> 47:17.640
And if y'all don't still believe us, why would Councilwoman Pages' dog Tyler run up to Drew

47:17.640 --> 47:18.520
Andrews?

47:18.520 --> 47:19.640
Yeah, see, exactly.

47:19.640 --> 47:22.040
It's like dogs only like one person.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.560
I dramatically let the dog go.

47:27.000 --> 47:35.000
In the style of those movies where the young boy and the evil guy of the movie are on opposite

47:35.000 --> 47:40.760
sides of a dog and they're both calling to it, it goes to the, I guess, the evil person

47:40.760 --> 47:43.240
in this situation, technically, from your perspective.

47:44.280 --> 47:49.800
But Tyler runs to the body of Drew Andrews and Kerry Pages grabs it around the neck once

47:49.800 --> 47:50.600
more.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.360
Oh my God, yes, Tyler.

47:52.360 --> 47:52.920
I love you.

47:52.920 --> 47:53.560
I love you.

47:53.560 --> 47:54.760
And it's like, thank you.

47:54.760 --> 47:55.480
Thank you, John.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.480
I know you didn't want to do that, but it's just, this is my everything.

48:00.120 --> 48:03.000
Harry, it's just that everything is fucked.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.160
You know how we thought that most things were fucked?

48:05.160 --> 48:06.760
It seems that everything is fucked.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.680
Yeah, yeah.

48:08.680 --> 48:14.120
Yeah, Gary, you've always been kind of open to the idea that things were hinky in the

48:14.120 --> 48:14.920
world, weren't you?

48:14.920 --> 48:16.360
Yeah, it's a great word for it.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.520
Is this ticking off any boxes?

48:18.520 --> 48:22.120
Like, oh yeah, I read about when body switching happened in that one book.

48:22.120 --> 48:25.720
Is this ringing any bells in any of your research or anything?

48:25.720 --> 48:26.840
How about goo?

48:26.840 --> 48:28.920
Was goo on your radar before today?

48:28.920 --> 48:32.440
Does this remind you of a certain Lindsay Lohan movie?

48:32.440 --> 48:35.560
Or perhaps have you researched the works of Silas Cole?

48:35.560 --> 48:37.880
That's a lot of questions all at once, fellas.

48:37.880 --> 48:45.000
And you know, I'm into a lot of this here stuff, but you know, I've seen some actual

48:45.000 --> 48:46.600
magic in my life.

48:46.600 --> 48:51.320
So yeah, I mean, I knew that this was all part of this.

48:51.320 --> 48:56.040
I mean, you'll remember the conversation we had on the phone when you were on the way

48:56.040 --> 48:56.680
to the city.

48:56.680 --> 48:57.480
How could we forget?

48:58.360 --> 49:01.400
It was your grandfather?

49:01.400 --> 49:03.880
Was it grandfather or father gave him the spell?

49:03.880 --> 49:05.480
Well, my grandfather gave me the book.

49:05.480 --> 49:08.200
It had, you know, three pages left in it.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.320
And they were specifically for the three of you.

49:11.320 --> 49:15.720
And boy, those words danced off light like the page and just lit like a fire.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.360
Are there any of those pages left or was...

49:18.920 --> 49:19.960
Well, no.

49:19.960 --> 49:25.080
There were three in there for us and it burnt out in the spell that he did over our heads.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.040
Because there's three of us.

49:26.040 --> 49:26.920
That makes sense.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.920
Hey, why wasn't there a page for Justin?

49:28.920 --> 49:29.800
Who's Justin?

49:30.440 --> 49:31.080
Never mind.

49:31.080 --> 49:34.040
You think there weren't a bunch of pages that created Wolf the dog?

49:39.000 --> 49:39.560
Good point.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.520
No, there were only three when I got it.

49:42.520 --> 49:44.200
It was very thick, very thick.

49:44.200 --> 49:47.000
But when you'd open it up, you could only get to like three pages.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.880
And then once they were gone, it was just empty.

49:49.880 --> 49:53.080
It was just shell on both sides, but it was still full.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.640
It looked like a book, but there's nothing in there.

49:55.640 --> 49:59.160
We found a book that will only open to one page.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.920
Kind of looks like her tattoo.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.040
The page that it opens up to.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.000
The book itself, it was maybe skin bound.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.960
Was the book you had bound by perhaps skin?

50:07.960 --> 50:09.240
Man skin.

50:09.240 --> 50:13.080
The face of Gary Daley loses blood.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.440
Yeah, I sure didn't like touching that book.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.280
I wanted to get rid of it as fast as I could.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.320
You got it from your grandfather?

50:21.320 --> 50:21.960
Yeah.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.280
Yeah, when the pages were gone, what did you do with it?

50:24.280 --> 50:26.600
Well, I don't.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.320
Did you give it to Clark's parents?

50:31.880 --> 50:33.160
And Gary starts crying.

50:33.720 --> 50:36.920
Clark, we found it in Jim's house.

50:36.920 --> 50:38.600
It would have been Jim, right?

50:38.600 --> 50:41.080
That you gave it to if you give it to anybody.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.560
No, I haven't really mentioned to you in all the hubbub,

50:44.120 --> 50:49.160
what with the dog and the body switching and, you know, the fish magic.

50:49.160 --> 50:53.240
I'm just imagining all the NPCs encircling you while you're having this conversation.

50:54.440 --> 50:55.560
Sorry, what was that?

50:55.560 --> 51:01.240
When I was having my augury, as it was, and I saw that

51:02.760 --> 51:06.440
the entity before us that pretends to be Drew cannot be trusted.

51:07.400 --> 51:13.960
When I saw that, I also saw a vision of Kacelle searching your parents' home for that book.

51:14.920 --> 51:18.520
And Karen and Jim seemed to want it desperately.

51:19.320 --> 51:23.480
But Kevin found it and he didn't reveal it to the others.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.040
That's all I saw.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.160
Do you know where it is now?

51:28.040 --> 51:29.480
Clark, I'm so sorry.

51:31.480 --> 51:37.000
I knew how much power it had, but I didn't know that people were going to be after it

51:37.000 --> 51:38.040
the way they were.

51:38.040 --> 51:42.040
And I think they died because I gave it to them.

51:43.480 --> 51:48.760
Clark is staring at Gary with a little bit of anger and a little bit of confusion.

51:49.560 --> 51:52.120
Like this is really hitting some notes.

51:52.200 --> 51:58.040
I didn't, I didn't mean to, I didn't mean to cause their death or nothing.

51:58.040 --> 52:01.080
I just, I knew I needed to get rid of it because I didn't.

52:01.080 --> 52:07.160
I don't remember much about that day, but I do remember I heard, I heard a voice and

52:08.200 --> 52:10.280
they did, they said something about Karen.

52:10.280 --> 52:13.720
Karen, they said Karen did a magic trick and they all had to get out of there.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.880
And that's, that was the last time I,

52:17.880 --> 52:22.760
I don't, I don't understand though.

52:22.760 --> 52:25.400
I don't, why did you, why would you give them a book like that?

52:25.400 --> 52:27.640
Why would you think that they would want a book like that?

52:27.640 --> 52:29.160
They were customers.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.480
They were at the Daily Foam almost daily.

52:31.480 --> 52:35.000
And they always asked about the signs up on the wall.

52:35.000 --> 52:41.320
And we would talk often about, you know, conspiracy theories and occult texts.

52:41.320 --> 52:43.400
And they seem knowledgeable about that.

52:43.400 --> 52:47.240
No, they were just, they just had a passing interest, I think.

52:47.240 --> 52:49.320
Why did you need to give it to them?

52:49.320 --> 52:51.880
It was a book made out of a human.

52:51.880 --> 52:52.760
I didn't want it.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.400
And my parents did, did they take it?

52:55.400 --> 52:57.480
Did, did they, did they take the book?

52:57.480 --> 52:59.400
Like, did they know what they had?

52:59.400 --> 53:05.320
Did they, did they seem, did they seem gleeful in having it or was it just a curiosity for them?

53:05.320 --> 53:07.240
I don't remember seeing it in the house personally.

53:07.240 --> 53:10.120
So they obviously secreted it away or something.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.680
Well, it seemed to be a curiosity.

53:12.760 --> 53:19.480
But when I told them, I mean, I told them what it could do.

53:20.200 --> 53:24.440
So they knew, they knew the power that it had if they actually trusted me.

53:24.440 --> 53:25.320
What could it do?

53:25.320 --> 53:27.880
Yeah, you said the pages were empty, right?

53:27.880 --> 53:29.240
They couldn't do anything anymore, right?

53:29.240 --> 53:34.280
Well, I mean, they knew what it had been capable of doing previous, I suppose.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.120
Can I human Gary here?

53:36.120 --> 53:37.960
Yeah, you both want to roll?

53:37.960 --> 53:38.460
Sure.

53:38.460 --> 53:44.860
I fail 71 on a 30.

53:45.580 --> 53:47.020
75 on a 50.

53:47.020 --> 53:47.740
Fuck.

53:47.740 --> 53:48.780
Seems genuine to you guys.

53:49.580 --> 53:50.860
Coming across as genuine.

53:50.860 --> 53:52.620
I don't cheat on my rolls, motherfucker.

53:53.740 --> 53:55.260
No, I was talking about Gary.

53:55.260 --> 53:55.760
Oh.

53:58.220 --> 54:00.700
I knew exactly how to, now I get what you meant.

54:00.700 --> 54:01.900
Also, you said you failed.

54:02.780 --> 54:03.260
Bullshit.

54:03.260 --> 54:03.760
I know.

54:06.220 --> 54:07.020
Fucking liar.

54:08.460 --> 54:11.500
I've seen Luke take too long to think about what he writes sometimes.

54:15.580 --> 54:18.700
Gary, it's your grandfather's book.

54:18.700 --> 54:19.580
Do you know where he got it?

54:19.580 --> 54:21.660
What was your grandfather's name, by the way?

54:21.660 --> 54:23.100
Well, I'd have to look that up.

54:25.020 --> 54:26.140
Can I human that?

54:28.220 --> 54:29.260
That's not in there.

54:29.260 --> 54:30.620
That's not in the podcast.

54:30.620 --> 54:31.120
Fuck.

54:31.660 --> 54:33.340
I don't know if I ever said it.

54:33.340 --> 54:35.100
Oh, you mean in the vision?

54:35.100 --> 54:35.740
Yeah.

54:35.740 --> 54:36.540
You didn't say it.

54:36.540 --> 54:37.820
You just said grandfather.

54:37.820 --> 54:40.700
His name was, um, Gary?

54:41.740 --> 54:42.700
Grant Father.

54:44.940 --> 54:47.740
His name was Grant Father Bailey.

54:51.740 --> 54:53.980
And you don't know where he got that?

54:53.980 --> 54:56.380
Where, you know where old Grant got that book?

54:57.100 --> 55:01.900
Well, uh, we all, I mean, we all thought he was pretty crazy, but.

55:01.900 --> 55:05.020
And he looks over at Clara Blankenship's arm.

55:05.900 --> 55:07.820
You see that figure right there?

55:07.820 --> 55:11.820
That looks to be about what he described that dropped it off at the Daily Fuh.

55:11.820 --> 55:13.100
After closing time.

55:13.100 --> 55:13.980
Can you imagine that?

55:13.980 --> 55:15.020
Didn't even buy anything.

55:16.060 --> 55:17.980
Some people are just rude.

55:19.020 --> 55:22.940
You don't know if it's a bad day, a bad, uh, bad childhood.

55:22.940 --> 55:25.180
It's like, he has no respect for other people's time.

55:29.340 --> 55:31.500
I don't know anybody with the problem with that.

55:31.500 --> 55:32.000
Blind.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.720
So does that, does that tattoo ring a bell for anybody?

55:36.720 --> 55:38.240
Have you ever seen anything like that?

55:38.240 --> 55:38.640
Yeah.

55:38.640 --> 55:44.640
Weird man who I took to be some sort of robot at the time approached me, uh, uh, outside

55:44.640 --> 55:49.680
the hospital after I went to follow up on some, some lead, it seems like years ago now.

55:50.880 --> 55:54.640
I remember that he gave you that note that was in binary, right?

55:54.640 --> 55:55.120
Yeah.

55:55.120 --> 55:58.640
And it said, uh, John, I killed the cheese pops.

55:58.640 --> 56:00.000
He was rogue like that?

56:00.000 --> 56:00.880
He sure was.

56:02.080 --> 56:05.680
I guess it was just cause it was in binary that I assumed it was mechanical.

56:05.680 --> 56:10.640
Uh, and then he, then he said, say hi to me for me.

56:11.440 --> 56:13.200
Do you reckon that might've been old Clark?

56:14.160 --> 56:17.520
We've certainly seen old me in robes.

56:17.520 --> 56:21.520
That's that's when, when he did that thing in the mausoleum, he was wearing a robe.

56:21.520 --> 56:24.480
John like jots down suspect has been seen in robes.

56:25.200 --> 56:35.520
But that would, that would mean that I, when I was, when I was a kid, Gary, Gary, you were

56:35.520 --> 56:36.080
there.

56:36.080 --> 56:36.640
What?

56:36.640 --> 56:38.320
When I was a kid, I came to visit mr.

56:38.320 --> 56:41.920
Fingersen at the library and you were there and you were reading a book.

56:42.720 --> 56:45.200
And when you read from the book, do you remember this?

56:45.200 --> 56:45.600
Okay.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.120
No, it was not my fault.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.720
I stand by that though.

56:48.720 --> 56:50.320
The book of, you know, St.

56:50.880 --> 56:55.440
Oscythe witches or whatever I was reading that day does not have anything to do with

56:55.440 --> 56:57.840
any cloaked figures except for witches.

56:57.840 --> 57:01.840
You know, obviously sometimes we're cloaks, but either way, Gary, whether you did it or

57:01.840 --> 57:05.200
not, which I think you did, but whether you did it or not, you were there.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.520
And we saw that you remember that there was a cloak.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.480
There was a cloak man.

57:08.480 --> 57:13.440
He, he locked up the doors to the library and he was, he was being chased or chasing

57:13.440 --> 57:13.920
someone.

57:13.920 --> 57:18.160
He goes like, he's going to grab onto Clara Blankenship's arm to look closer at the

57:18.160 --> 57:18.560
tattoo.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.320
And then he's like, Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

57:20.320 --> 57:23.680
I did not mean to touch your arm to look at your tattoo.

57:23.680 --> 57:24.960
That would be extremely rude.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.720
Can I just look at that much closer?

57:26.720 --> 57:28.400
And she's like, yeah, of course, that's fine.

57:28.400 --> 57:31.120
And very closely puts his face right up to her arm.

57:31.120 --> 57:35.680
This motherfucker right here is exactly who was outside the Mary Cole public library

57:35.680 --> 57:36.000
that day.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.200
I swear to God.

57:37.200 --> 57:40.560
And thankfully that figure locked us in, right?

57:40.560 --> 57:40.880
Yeah.

57:40.880 --> 57:44.560
He used some sort of chains or something because there were these big tall creatures.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.240
Oh my goodness.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.320
I'm having all sorts of flashbacks right now.

57:48.320 --> 57:49.360
Yeah, they were wearing suits.

57:49.360 --> 57:52.560
They were these lanky translucent skin fuckers.

57:52.560 --> 57:56.320
I told John they, they, they were, they were the, they were the, they were those creatures.

57:56.320 --> 57:59.360
I remember now it was the, it was the thing that's been yelling at us.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.560
They were chasing the robed figure.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.800
And now you're saying that that could be old me.

58:05.600 --> 58:06.000
I don't know.

58:07.280 --> 58:08.560
I turned to Clara.

58:08.560 --> 58:09.520
I am so sorry.

58:09.520 --> 58:14.400
I know you guys are having like a whole thing right now and it seems, seems really important.

58:15.280 --> 58:20.800
But I, if I can, since the figure that you're talking about was in my dreams and has been

58:20.800 --> 58:27.680
in my recurring dreams for the past few years and a long time now, I have this video that

58:27.680 --> 58:30.800
I found online from this dude in contention way back when.

58:30.800 --> 58:36.720
And since it's been scrubbed from the internet and I'm pretty sure that like some sort of

58:36.720 --> 58:41.840
black ops special secret service kind of like men in black shit took it off the internet

58:41.840 --> 58:43.680
because I looked him up recently.

58:43.680 --> 58:44.960
I think he disappeared.

58:46.160 --> 58:46.800
Whose video?

58:46.800 --> 58:48.080
His name's John Peters.

58:50.560 --> 58:51.840
It's this YouTube video.

58:51.840 --> 58:56.080
He used to have a channel where he talked about the dreams he had during this coma that

58:56.080 --> 58:58.240
he was in for like a while.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.080
He was in the hospital for an extended time.

59:00.080 --> 59:01.840
Could be any John Peters in a coma.

59:01.840 --> 59:09.840
So for listeners, you can go to any of our social media sites, Instagram at pretending

59:09.840 --> 59:14.800
pod, Twitter at pretending pod, or go to the Facebook page, which is pretending to be people.

59:14.800 --> 59:16.720
And you can find this video.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.200
I'll play the audio of it right now.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.320
If I can make that happen.

59:26.880 --> 59:28.240
Hello everybody.

59:28.240 --> 59:34.480
Welcome back to John Peters channel where I'm talking about my visions that I saw while

59:34.480 --> 59:39.840
having a over a month long coma here in contention.

59:40.880 --> 59:49.760
I believe these visions showed me a world or a land that is parallel to our own simultaneously

59:49.760 --> 59:50.640
existing.

59:50.640 --> 59:59.680
I was led there by a man who only carried a black Nike bag and when he reached out to

59:59.680 --> 01:00:09.520
shake my hand upon introductions, it smelled of sweet meats like a grill and my hand burned

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.480
and burned.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.280
That is all for now.
