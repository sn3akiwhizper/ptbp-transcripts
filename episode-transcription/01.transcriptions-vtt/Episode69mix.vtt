00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
Y'all, I'm so fuckin' pumped. This is so fuckin' tasty.

00:06.200 --> 00:10.700
Even though y'all are listening to me from 26 years in the past,

00:10.700 --> 00:19.500
I know that this very special nice episode number will bring you to a delicious audio climax like it does me.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.700
It's episode 69, my babies!

00:22.700 --> 00:27.000
From the Station 694.2 PTBP,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.500
I'm Wolf the Dog, and I'm from the future.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.000
You are whoever the fuck you are from the past.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.600
Let's get it, y'all.

00:35.600 --> 00:43.300
Let's intertwine, like the good numbers 6 and 9, and bring each other to a new plane of existence.

00:43.300 --> 00:46.500
Where pleasure is the only thing we can feel,

00:46.500 --> 00:52.000
as we become one sexy oily blob together in the corners of space-time.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.200
Uh...

00:53.200 --> 00:56.800
So anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mandy.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.700
At SketchyPixels, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.800
They write,

01:02.800 --> 01:04.600
Hello, Wolf the Dog.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.700
Ah, wooooo!

01:07.700 --> 01:12.500
Longtime contention-based fan of the show here, and I had a question for you.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.900
I don't know how much you know about tabletop games or role-playing,

01:16.900 --> 01:20.700
but I'm hoping to get a regular group here in contention to play.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.400
I have experience running a couple games,

01:23.400 --> 01:27.900
and would love to host a new group since my last group kind of vanished.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.900
I boasted around town about meeting up at the library.

01:31.900 --> 01:37.200
No one's really showed up yet, and the town has seemed kind of empty lately.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.100
But I'm sure it'll pick up soon.

01:39.100 --> 01:44.100
Anyone interested in playing can come down to the library pretty much whenever.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.800
I'm there all the time.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
At all times.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.900
Just waitin' with my dice.

01:49.900 --> 01:50.900
Waiting.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.000
Always waiting.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.500
My question is, if you could create a character to go on an adventure,

01:57.500 --> 01:59.500
what kind of character would you make?

01:59.500 --> 02:06.000
I also wanted to return shout-out my very good friend Disa, who shouted me out the other day.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.200
Thanks for getting me into the show and for generally being an awesome friend.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.300
Thanks for writin' in, Mandy.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

02:14.700 --> 02:18.200
But really, what the fuck is role-playing?

02:18.300 --> 02:23.100
The only role I know how to play is that of Wolf the Dog, baby.

02:23.100 --> 02:32.100
He is very strong, very sexy, and very smart, and very addicted to trash can eateries.

02:32.100 --> 02:36.000
If you're the kind of hoe who wants this show to grow with gusto,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.800
throw us some dough and bestow your bows and crows with the no.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.400
That one was a stretch.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.100
And my producer definitely wrote that and made me read it,

02:45.100 --> 02:48.200
or he was gonna incinerate all my trash.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.300
Now, uh, we're on Patreon.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.600
And please tell your friends and internet followers to listen to this damn show.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.500
Goddamn, I wish I knew how to get on the internet.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.300
Sounds wild, y'all.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.500
Now it's time for the news.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.400
Bradley Cooper found Jack Russell's go-bag in his floorboards

03:06.400 --> 03:10.200
while Walter and Alan Grimes watched him on their television.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.900
Roger and Angela Fairfield had a perfectly normal conversation

03:14.900 --> 03:18.000
about vaccinations needed to go abroad.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.700
Charles Digby had a short and confusing conversation

03:21.700 --> 03:25.800
with a young girl on a walkie-talkie he found under his bed.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.700
What the fuck is going on?

03:27.700 --> 03:31.900
I thought this one was supposed to, you know, be like nice,

03:31.900 --> 03:34.900
like calm and comfy and shit,

03:34.900 --> 03:38.100
or like the good number 69.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.900
I guess I don't know much,

03:39.900 --> 03:43.600
but I do know universal healthcare shouldn't be divisive.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.500
Sex work is work.

03:45.500 --> 03:50.000
Food waste and the existence of billionaires have the same solution.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.200
And this brand new track that I'm premiering here for y'all is a bit on the nose.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.900
It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual.

03:59.900 --> 04:16.900
Don't make me crazy, baby

04:16.900 --> 04:23.900
This is real love dream

04:23.900 --> 04:31.900
I knew I'd make you be foolish

04:35.900 --> 04:39.900
There we go. Episode 69.

04:39.900 --> 04:46.900
Hey, that's a sex number. It is indeed, and this is a sex episode.

04:46.900 --> 04:52.900
Angela and Roger gonna fuck.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.400
You told me to expect something today.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.700
I didn't realize. Oh, some actual roleplay.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.200
We might actually just upload a video of us like larping it.

05:02.200 --> 05:07.400
If that's more appropriate for the no, that makes total sense.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.500
You're cool with that, right?

05:08.500 --> 05:10.800
Yeah, it'll just be in character won't be like it's me and you

05:10.800 --> 05:12.100
when I signed up for this podcast.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.700
I knew that there would be some light sex involved.

05:15.700 --> 05:19.300
That's what the contract said that you wrote up.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.100
I've changed the word light in the contract.

05:22.100 --> 05:27.600
So we are going to I asked all of you guys to to come in a little

05:27.600 --> 05:30.500
prepared this week, which I always feel nervous.

05:30.500 --> 05:36.600
Actually, that's laughing because my eyes went wide.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.100
No, I can always count on you, Joe.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.400
Oh, no.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.900
So what did I ask you for?

05:43.900 --> 05:45.700
We're going to talk about a bad memory.

05:45.700 --> 05:50.300
We are indeed and I asked you to present some sort of a first-person

05:50.300 --> 05:56.500
narrative of a bad memory that is that is brought you to calm comfy

05:56.500 --> 05:57.400
campground, right?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.700
Yeah, it was something that related to how we got here.

05:59.700 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, God my voice feels really like rough and deep right now cuz

06:06.300 --> 06:10.400
this is the first while I we don't always record on Tuesday nights,

06:10.400 --> 06:14.700
but pretty much always and we're doing a Saturday.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.700
It's brunch time.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.700
It should have been.

06:20.400 --> 06:25.100
Saturday record session is going to get a little silly maybe Joe's

06:25.100 --> 06:27.400
Roger Fairfield goes to sleep.

06:27.400 --> 06:33.900
He drifts into a deep slumber sitting on a chair book on your chest

06:33.900 --> 06:39.000
learning about the flora of the area around calm comfy campground.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.200
And then hey Zach, will you tell me about some of that?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.500
Yeah, there's plants.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.900
What you didn't write it out.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.500
You didn't talk about what all the trees were here.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.000
I don't know a lot of science words.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.200
There's big ones and small ones, green ones and brown ones.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.300
Yeah, so far so good.

06:57.300 --> 06:57.600
Cool.

06:57.900 --> 07:01.600
There's a lot of flowers in that book that cover many many different

07:01.600 --> 07:05.800
species and different shrubberies and bushes.

07:05.800 --> 07:10.900
It's it's actually it's it's quite remarkable for the area that it

07:10.900 --> 07:11.700
has plants.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.800
Just how many just how many different species.

07:16.900 --> 07:27.700
Yes, and so as you fall into this this sweet sweet nap night nap the

07:27.700 --> 07:31.900
long night nap that you'll wake up from probably in the morning.

07:31.900 --> 07:32.400
Sure.

07:34.100 --> 07:34.700
Why not?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.000
I would like you to just give me a rundown from a first-person

07:38.000 --> 07:41.700
perspective of a bad memory that brought you here.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.700
Oh shit.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.500
This isn't how I thought this was going to happen.

07:44.500 --> 07:44.900
Okay.

07:45.400 --> 07:45.900
Okay.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.100
I thought for sure I'd be talking to somebody about it.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.300
You're talking to the listeners about it.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
Well, I you know kind of hold on.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.400
Sorry about that.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.500
I had to just go into the kitchen.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.100
I don't know if you could hear the bleed through on the mics of

08:04.500 --> 08:08.500
Justin and Thomas and Luke having just a joyful conversation.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.300
We don't want them having fun out there.

08:10.300 --> 08:14.000
No, no fun whatsoever out there and put a kibosh on that.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.700
I was so confused to find them standing all in the same room.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.800
They didn't need to be that loud to hear each other.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.000
It's wild so strange.

08:23.200 --> 08:23.600
Okay.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.400
All right, Joe Rogers having a dream.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.600
Yeah, he is in the dream.

08:27.700 --> 08:28.000
Yes.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.100
He oh you said first person.

08:30.300 --> 08:36.800
I I'm dreaming of I'm dreaming of my time before I met Angela.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.400
It's I'm in a classroom and I'm doing my notes and I'm going home

08:41.400 --> 08:45.600
and studying and I'm reading my textbooks and I'm falling asleep

08:45.600 --> 08:48.500
and I'm waking up and I'm going to the gym and I'm going to class

08:48.500 --> 08:52.300
and I'm going home and studying and I'm falling asleep in just

08:52.300 --> 08:54.300
one day on the way to class.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.700
I ran into this girl and I mean ran into her.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.500
She stopped me in my tracks because she was looking down and

09:02.500 --> 09:05.900
I was looking up and boom and her bracelet went flying and

09:05.900 --> 09:09.300
my glasses flew off and I gathered all those things up and

09:09.300 --> 09:10.900
she put the glasses on my face.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.400
I something about something about her face that I didn't go

09:15.400 --> 09:16.100
to class that day.

09:16.100 --> 09:20.200
I asked her to go get a cup of coffee with me meet you make

09:20.200 --> 09:22.900
you we were kind of inseparable after that.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.500
We she was she was not like me at all.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.200
If she saw a cool car, she would run over and ask the person

09:30.200 --> 09:30.800
in the parking lot.

09:30.800 --> 09:35.000
If it was theirs and talk to them about it and I would not

09:35.000 --> 09:35.300
do that.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.800
That's not something I would ever have done just talking

09:37.800 --> 09:39.800
to strangers talking to strangers at all.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.300
But it's just because I wasn't that interested but she's

09:43.300 --> 09:43.800
interested.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.700
She's she's interested in everything.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.300
It's she's always asking stuff.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.000
She's always asking about my life.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.900
She's asking about my work and I don't like to talk about

09:52.900 --> 09:53.700
that very often.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.500
I don't know.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.200
I'm an archaeologist and I feel like everybody would find

09:57.200 --> 09:57.700
that boring.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.300
I don't like to talk about my work because I see eyes glaze

10:00.300 --> 10:02.300
over but she would always ask and I would go and tell her

10:02.300 --> 10:03.800
what I could so Raj.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.000
What what did you what are you working on today?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.600
I mean, it's just old dusty bricks out to yeah, but they're

10:09.600 --> 10:13.000
your dusty bricks and I want to know about your dusty bricks.

10:13.400 --> 10:18.300
I mean, it's not we found we found a we found a city we

10:18.300 --> 10:21.600
found a city a city a whole city.

10:22.200 --> 10:22.900
Oh my God.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.100
That's like a big deal or I don't have to feign interest.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.100
It's just I'm interested.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.300
Really?

10:29.400 --> 10:29.900
Of course.

10:29.900 --> 10:30.300
I am.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.700
It's it's our life.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
It is it's cool.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.300
It's an old.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.500
It's an old old city that nobody's seen it before.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.300
What's it called?

10:36.500 --> 10:38.400
We're just calling it the nameless city right now.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.200
We don't really have a term for it.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.200
That's spooky.

10:41.300 --> 10:45.100
It's it's neat as you're reliving this moment with Angela.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.100
She freezes completely.

10:49.700 --> 10:54.300
And you notice that the air is stagnant around you no more

10:54.300 --> 10:57.900
sound you'd heard birds chirping second ago.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.500
They're no longer chirping.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.900
You heard a car was literally driving by at that exact moment.

11:03.900 --> 11:08.000
He kind of clants out the window and it is stopped in the

11:08.000 --> 11:12.800
middle of the road and walking into the room is a man with

11:12.800 --> 11:17.200
black dress shoes gray slacks and a white shirt.

11:18.400 --> 11:22.900
It's James the executive director of calm comfy campground.

11:23.600 --> 11:29.300
So Roger, what would you want to change in this moment?

11:29.600 --> 11:33.500
If you could go back it was it wasn't it wasn't that moment

11:33.500 --> 11:35.800
that that that moment was was nice.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.000
It was it was all the times after that that she she just

11:39.000 --> 11:43.400
kept asking kept asking kept trying to tell me have me tell

11:43.400 --> 11:45.600
her more it became exhausting.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.500
I couldn't I didn't I didn't my work is my work.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.000
I don't I don't want to have to relay my notes every night

11:51.000 --> 11:51.500
to her.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.700
I would get I would get snippy sometimes when she would ask

11:54.700 --> 11:58.300
about my work and one night I yelled at her.

11:58.700 --> 12:03.600
Let's go there and he snaps his fingers and he's gone and

12:03.600 --> 12:07.500
you are where were you when this took place laying in bed

12:08.300 --> 12:08.700
hot.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.200
We laying in our separate beds.

12:17.400 --> 12:17.700
Yeah.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.500
Well, it's 26 years ago.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.200
Obviously, I love Lucy style bedroom.

12:22.200 --> 12:22.500
Yeah.

12:22.500 --> 12:22.800
Yeah.

12:24.600 --> 12:28.500
Okay, but like just I mean any like a single detail like a

12:28.500 --> 12:29.300
single detail.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.200
We don't it's dusty.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.500
It's dusty and there's rocks and sometimes.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.100
There's writing on the fucking rocks Angela and she just

12:37.100 --> 12:40.900
looks at you with these big eyes and you see a little bit

12:40.900 --> 12:44.000
of the light just die in them.

12:45.500 --> 12:50.600
Life freezes once again and James walks into the room.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.000
So that wasn't great.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.600
No, it's not fun to see it again.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.400
Do you think that there was anything else leading to this

12:59.400 --> 13:03.500
or was it just a repetition that led you down this aggressive

13:03.500 --> 13:04.100
pathway?

13:04.200 --> 13:08.200
I mean, she's just she's just so so different from the way

13:08.200 --> 13:11.600
I used to live every everything about her is the antithesis

13:11.600 --> 13:12.000
of me.

13:12.700 --> 13:16.200
She likes to do things and I do the same things.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.200
Oh, I thought of something really cool to say in this voice

13:25.400 --> 13:27.700
in the shower last night and I practiced it.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.800
But I don't remember what it was.

13:29.800 --> 13:30.500
Oh, man.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.700
I literally I think it was just calling somebody a chump.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.700
I'm just picture you in the shower.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.100
I think it was shut it jump.

13:42.000 --> 13:42.600
I thought of that.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.800
I was like, that's actually hilarious.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.400
Your body wash is like ball episode 69 Thomas.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
That's the sex number.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.900
That's my second name and favorite number after the drug

13:52.900 --> 13:53.300
number.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.400
Oh, you prefer the drug number?

13:57.400 --> 13:57.600
Yeah.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.400
Yeah me too.

13:59.500 --> 14:04.900
69 is like a great concept, but it's not honestly like it's

14:04.900 --> 14:06.000
too distracting.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.400
You can't focus on the pleasure.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.900
You're giving.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.700
Okay, we went different directions.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.800
So well because it's the same thing you can't focus on the

14:14.800 --> 14:16.600
pleasure you're getting because you're focused on the pleasure

14:16.600 --> 14:18.800
you're giving I tend to focus on the pleasure.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.600
I'm giving Zach.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.900
So that's well, that's what I was trying to believe on.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
All right, so I we went over this with Joe but I asked you

14:28.700 --> 14:33.900
guys to to be able to relay a bad memory in first person.

14:33.900 --> 14:39.200
And so we're just going to jump right on in as you fall asleep

14:39.300 --> 14:44.000
in your very nice pajamas silken high-thread count jammies.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.300
Your mind goes blank for the first time all day.

14:49.700 --> 14:55.400
Not thinking about Cube not thinking about shades of white.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.100
That's such an ignorant thing to say.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.500
Well, I'm an ignorant boy.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.600
I could show you color palettes that would blow your mind.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.100
I had a friend he considered me a friend.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.700
I didn't necessarily treat him like much of one but we met

15:11.800 --> 15:12.900
after college.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.500
This was 26 years ago.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.000
Not not like the 26 years ago.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.200
We might hypothetically be living in now.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.900
This was actually 26 years ago and it was a time for technology.

15:27.600 --> 15:32.700
We were just some California kids out there me Martin Cupertino

15:33.400 --> 15:35.400
and Bill Bosniak.

15:36.700 --> 15:40.200
You know a lot, you know a lot more technically than I did

15:41.100 --> 15:44.100
and and we dreamed of building something big together.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.500
I was working for for a video game company called Campari.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.300
They came to us with a challenge if you could remove as

15:51.300 --> 15:55.300
many chips as possible from from the circuit board for their

15:55.700 --> 15:59.500
for the new video game, they would give you $50 a chip.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.200
No a hundred dollars a chip.

16:01.500 --> 16:01.900
I swear.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.800
I just read the Wikipedia on this so I know what I'm talking

16:05.800 --> 16:10.300
about. Wikipedia is a thing that will exist 26 years in the

16:10.300 --> 16:14.100
future, which is where I consider myself to be existing at

16:14.100 --> 16:16.000
all times spiritually.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.600
So Bill I knew he could he could take a crack at it.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.700
He could he could whittle down the chips on that circuit board

16:24.200 --> 16:27.200
where I couldn't and I promised him we'd split the reward

16:27.300 --> 16:30.900
evenly. He came back to me a few weeks later having removed

16:30.900 --> 16:31.800
50 chips.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.800
That's $5,000 in 26 years ago money.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.700
That was a lot of money at the time.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.800
I took his design to Campari.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.200
They gave me the $5,000 and I told Bill that they had only

16:45.200 --> 16:46.700
given us $700.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
I gave him $350.

16:50.900 --> 16:51.800
And it haunts me.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.400
Wait $700.

16:55.900 --> 16:59.200
I thought we were supposed to get wasn't it was a hundred

16:59.200 --> 17:00.500
dollars a chip, right?

17:02.300 --> 17:03.500
This is I'm Bill.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.500
Noted California technologist Bill Bosniak.

17:08.500 --> 17:12.300
Bill Bosniak here love California.

17:17.800 --> 17:18.900
That that pans.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.800
Yeah, so Bill they they kind of fucked us.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.200
I mean you did great work buddy, but they didn't give us

17:26.200 --> 17:27.500
the full 5,000.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.900
They only gave us $700.

17:28.900 --> 17:33.700
So here's your 350 big guy and at that exact moment life

17:33.700 --> 17:39.700
freezes Bill's face like it's been paused and walking into

17:39.700 --> 17:45.000
the room is a man in a white dress shirt gray slacks and

17:45.000 --> 17:46.300
black dress shoes.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.300
And it's James the executive director of calm comfy campground.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.300
So Bradley or should I say Martin if you could I fooled

17:57.300 --> 18:02.200
you if you could go back to this moment and you could change

18:02.200 --> 18:02.900
anything.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.700
I've thought about that a lot.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.800
Would you yeah, I'd tell him they didn't pay us anything

18:09.100 --> 18:10.600
and keep all the money for myself.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.900
I use that to start our company the stock options.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.500
He got from that alone more than made up for it.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.700
I mean if I had had 350 extra bucks to put into that 26

18:21.700 --> 18:22.300
years ago.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.400
That might be worth two or three points, you know on the

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
stock these days.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.400
That's a few more million dollars for him for old Bill is

18:31.400 --> 18:34.300
the regret of not being able to get your friend more money

18:34.500 --> 18:35.100
later.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.600
I made my friend a very wealthy man not as wealthy as he

18:38.600 --> 18:42.600
might have been if I was honest with him over the 15 years

18:42.600 --> 18:44.300
or so of our professional Association.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.800
I've thought about both ways.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.000
What if I gave him his full amount?

18:49.500 --> 18:52.800
What if I gave him nothing neither option seems satisfactory?

18:53.100 --> 18:54.800
I wouldn't be where I was today without it.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.700
I guess I regret nothing.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.000
This place really works.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.800
I want this is Joe's.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.100
Yeah, it's just nice bag.

19:12.100 --> 19:12.900
Not anymore.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.000
I just put my dice in my dice bag now tell Joe anything

19:19.000 --> 19:20.500
totally my dice bag.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.500
Hello, Justin.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.300
Well, hello, Justin.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.200
It's so nice to see you.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.700
I forgot the rest of the Hello Dolly.

19:30.700 --> 19:31.600
I don't know the words.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.800
You said the ones I know.

19:34.800 --> 19:35.100
Yep.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.800
Those are the ones it's so something something something.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.300
Yeah.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.000
Hello Dolly.

19:40.000 --> 19:40.700
Hello Dolly.

19:41.700 --> 19:42.900
You're my Dolly.

19:42.900 --> 19:50.200
Oh, you're my Louis Armstrong Louis Louis Louis Louis when

19:50.200 --> 19:55.500
I'm wearing my formal attire, I am Louis and this the sweaters

19:55.500 --> 19:59.400
obviously so Justin it's episode 69.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.300
Oh, I forgot about that.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.300
Yeah, I don't think it might have a celebrated it.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.800
The best number we should have started episode 1 with like

20:07.800 --> 20:14.400
this is the countdown to episode 69 I asked you to have a

20:14.400 --> 20:17.900
bad memory prepared and we're going to dive into it as you

20:17.900 --> 20:23.800
fall asleep caffeine riddled mind racing, but tuckered out

20:23.800 --> 20:27.000
from a long day at calm comfy campground you get into bed

20:27.000 --> 20:31.400
after having a less than normal experience with a walkie-talkie

20:31.400 --> 20:32.200
under your bed.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.300
Yeah, that was unsettling but it is on your nightstand as

20:36.300 --> 20:37.000
you sleep.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.300
Yeah, but not not unsettling enough that I don't leave it

20:40.300 --> 20:45.200
on right next to your glutton for unsettlement.

20:45.200 --> 20:50.700
Come on, baby as you drift asleep your mind opens back up

20:51.000 --> 20:54.600
and you find yourself amidst this memory.

20:54.900 --> 21:00.400
So when we first got together Sam was everything to me.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.600
She warmed my heart in a way that no one else had since I

21:04.600 --> 21:06.600
was like a teenager or something.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.700
I don't think I've ever known a love like that in my entire

21:09.700 --> 21:13.600
life that made me want to cling to her all the harder.

21:14.600 --> 21:19.400
We had these matching coffee cups each with the first letter

21:19.400 --> 21:20.600
of our first names.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.000
It was one of the first things we bought when we first moved

21:23.000 --> 21:26.200
in together after our first year of living with each other.

21:26.200 --> 21:31.100
I started noticing some things it's in my nature to pick

21:31.100 --> 21:33.900
up on other people's routines and whatnot.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.200
I noticed that she was running late from work more often.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.200
I told myself it was all fine.

21:39.300 --> 21:42.300
It'd be okay me and Rolo had the place to ourselves every

21:42.300 --> 21:46.300
now and then boys night in and all that Taco Tuesday with

21:46.300 --> 21:47.400
Rolo. Sure.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.100
Why not?

21:48.500 --> 21:50.900
She would tell me about these happy hour things with her

21:50.900 --> 21:51.500
co-workers.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.300
It was helping her network move up the ladder all that stuff

21:55.300 --> 21:56.300
a couple nights.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.900
She would get home real late.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.300
Then it started to spread to some weekend nights this drifted

22:01.300 --> 22:02.500
on for about a month.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.000
So I did what I'm good at.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.200
I started tailing her.

22:07.900 --> 22:11.500
I took some pictures of her with her friends co-workers whoever

22:11.500 --> 22:14.400
she was with I started keeping a folder with pictures and

22:14.400 --> 22:17.200
names to see if they matched with people from work like she

22:17.200 --> 22:21.900
had told me so one night I get a call from a client and I

22:21.900 --> 22:24.900
have to storm off somewhere to capture some pictures of someone

22:24.900 --> 22:26.200
in a timely manner.

22:26.600 --> 22:32.400
I get back home real late that night Sam is she's on the floor

22:32.900 --> 22:36.700
crying but furious looking at the pictures of her and her

22:36.700 --> 22:40.300
peers that I had taken my heart nearly stopped.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.600
I just about projectile vomit from the nerves.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.400
Everything was a fucking mess.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.400
I remember in this moment looking at my overweight cat Rolo

22:50.600 --> 22:53.900
and I could see in his eyes this feeling of like holy shit

22:53.900 --> 22:55.200
you fucked up guy.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.400
She yells at me now.

22:57.400 --> 23:02.400
I'm used to being yelled at my job doesn't always elicit joy

23:02.500 --> 23:05.500
from others, but this felt like the wrath of some kind of

23:05.500 --> 23:09.900
cruel dark God was coming my way her raised voice pierced

23:09.900 --> 23:10.700
my soul.

23:11.100 --> 23:14.200
I try to tell her that I was just worried about how she'd

23:14.200 --> 23:16.100
been spending more time away from me.

23:16.300 --> 23:19.600
I was just concerned about her really honest, but she could

23:19.600 --> 23:21.200
see right through my bullshit.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.300
She knew it was because I didn't trust her deep down that

23:25.300 --> 23:27.300
I have trouble trusting anyone.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.600
She said exactly that to me and I denied it.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.500
I get defensive.

23:33.700 --> 23:36.000
I start running down all the things I had seen her doing

23:36.000 --> 23:39.400
at what times and where I told her that I had a reason not

23:39.400 --> 23:40.200
to trust her.

23:40.800 --> 23:45.800
That's when she threw her coffee cup down on the floor next

23:45.800 --> 23:47.600
to all those fucking pictures.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.800
She started packing up her stuff in a hurry.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.600
She was out of there so fast the next morning.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.700
Just me my obese cat and one half of a matching set of coffee

23:59.700 --> 24:03.200
cups and those goddamn pictures that I never should have

24:03.200 --> 24:07.800
taken and as Charles Digby is staring down at these pictures

24:08.900 --> 24:14.400
the world stops like someone paused the television.

24:15.500 --> 24:19.800
That morning you could hear the birds chirping dogs playing

24:19.800 --> 24:21.400
outside in the neighborhood.

24:21.800 --> 24:24.200
You could hear the city streets.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.700
But all of that is now completely silent and stepping into

24:29.700 --> 24:34.300
the room is a man wearing a white button-down shirt gray

24:34.300 --> 24:38.500
slacks and black dress shoes and it's James the executive

24:38.500 --> 24:41.000
director at calm comfy campground.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.600
So that was pretty rough.

24:45.900 --> 24:50.300
Now if you if you could talk to this version of yourself

24:50.300 --> 24:52.700
right here, what would you say to him?

24:52.900 --> 24:55.800
I'd yell at him and say what what have you done?

24:56.100 --> 24:59.600
You've ruined one of the best things you've ever had going

24:59.600 --> 25:00.500
in your life.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.800
You fucking fool.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.600
You're no longer standing over these pictures, but you're

25:05.600 --> 25:09.900
standing in your workroom your office holding your camera

25:09.900 --> 25:14.000
about to go out and tail Sam for the first time and you can

25:14.000 --> 25:15.600
see the look on your own face.

25:15.800 --> 25:20.700
And again everything pauses and James steps up now if you

25:20.700 --> 25:23.000
had the opportunity, would you change it?

25:23.100 --> 25:27.000
I absolutely would I would I would do anything to undo what

25:27.000 --> 25:29.200
I did take the camera out of his hands.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.200
I died put my hands on the camera and yank it out and a

25:32.200 --> 25:34.000
wrestle it away from yourself.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.200
Yeah, is he like really stiff?

25:35.200 --> 25:35.600
Yeah.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.000
Yeah got that rigor mortis.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.000
Yeah, I'm like just like take it out like really fucking

25:43.300 --> 25:44.400
feisty angry.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.200
That's good.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.200
It's good.

25:46.500 --> 25:46.600
Now.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.000
What would you have to do?

25:48.300 --> 25:52.400
What would you have to explain to this version of yourself

25:52.900 --> 25:55.900
in order to keep you from doing this again?

25:56.100 --> 25:57.100
You got to trust people.

25:57.100 --> 26:01.700
You can't just assume the worst in everybody even though

26:01.700 --> 26:03.900
that's your that's your day job.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.700
You can't do that with the people you love you have to

26:06.700 --> 26:10.000
assume the best out of the people you love.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.200
Luke in the room.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.500
I'm here, baby.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.500
Are you ready for episode 69?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.400
I've never been more ready.

26:26.300 --> 26:30.100
That means we've been doing this for like a long time like

26:30.100 --> 26:32.200
I'm like a couple months.

26:33.400 --> 26:38.400
So Walter Grimes turns his chin down to his chest and those

26:38.400 --> 26:44.000
piercing blue baby eyes clothes or turn dark.

26:45.000 --> 26:53.200
Yeah, I'm in my room laying in bed looking at book not

26:53.200 --> 26:57.000
really reading it or taking it in just kind of staring

26:57.000 --> 27:02.900
and Alan walks into the room and he's in a bit of a huff

27:03.200 --> 27:08.900
and he comes over to me and I hear noises from another

27:08.900 --> 27:11.300
room and he doesn't say anything.

27:11.300 --> 27:15.300
He just comes over and he places his finger underneath

27:15.300 --> 27:20.800
my chin and everything goes dark, but I'm not off.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.300
I can't move.

27:22.600 --> 27:27.800
I can't see but I can still hear the voices get closer

27:27.800 --> 27:33.300
and I hear Alan talk about selling me.

27:33.600 --> 27:38.700
I hear two men enter the room and I can feel them touching

27:38.700 --> 27:43.200
me and I feel their presence and I can tell they're looking

27:43.500 --> 27:48.900
me over and inspecting different parts of my body and Alan

27:49.100 --> 27:55.500
keep saying numbers and they are negotiating about how much

27:55.500 --> 28:00.400
I'm worth and at the end of it Alan he tells them to leave

28:00.500 --> 28:05.400
and he turns me back on and he asked if I'm okay is everything

28:05.400 --> 28:11.000
okay Walter and he acts like nothing happened and I yeah,

28:11.200 --> 28:16.700
I don't ask him about it, but it's the first time I realized

28:16.700 --> 28:21.600
that I consider Alan my father, but I don't know if he considers

28:21.600 --> 28:25.800
me his son and at that exact moment Walters face freezes

28:26.100 --> 28:31.200
like it's been paused almost like he's been turned off but

28:31.200 --> 28:35.300
you notice that the ceiling fan in the room that was on previous

28:35.400 --> 28:39.200
is just frozen in the air above you and at that moment the

28:39.200 --> 28:43.500
door opens and a man walks in he's wearing white button-down

28:43.500 --> 28:49.200
shirt gray slacks and black shoes and it is James the executive

28:49.200 --> 28:51.500
director at calm comfy campground.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.100
So Walter, why did you tell him everything was okay?

28:57.300 --> 28:59.400
Everything is okay.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.800
Do you actually believe that it's what I've been told do you

29:02.800 --> 29:06.900
have thoughts that aren't what you've been told?

29:07.100 --> 29:07.500
Yes.

29:08.100 --> 29:12.400
I try not to think about them like what mostly bad things.

29:12.900 --> 29:13.900
I'm not real.

29:14.300 --> 29:18.300
I mean I am real but not in the way that you are.

29:18.700 --> 29:21.500
I mean, I'm here talking to you.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.600
We're in one of your memories.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.000
You seem real to me.

29:25.200 --> 29:25.600
Okay.

29:26.200 --> 29:31.800
So if you're not real to you, what does that make you feel inferior?

29:32.200 --> 29:34.500
Do you worry about that sometimes?

29:34.500 --> 29:41.100
Yes, when I'm trying to learn more and read sometimes I don't

29:41.100 --> 29:43.900
actually read and I ruminate on bad thoughts.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.700
Is it your goal to get rid of this inferior feeling that would

29:48.700 --> 29:49.200
be nice.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.000
Yes, and how do you intend to achieve that goal?

29:52.500 --> 29:54.200
I don't think about it often.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.900
So I haven't thought that far ahead.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.300
Do you think it's possible?

29:59.700 --> 30:00.900
Anything is possible.

30:02.800 --> 30:09.800
I'm going to combat Thomas's character with deep gravel boys.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.200
Nice try bees the deep gravelly boys.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.800
Ooh, I do like that.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.600
Did you be DJ me?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.700
Did you be fair to be a part of that group?

30:20.700 --> 30:21.000
Alan?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.500
You gotta go and go fuck yourself.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.400
Fuck off Nixon.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.500
Well before them, I'm part of a girl.

30:29.000 --> 30:29.600
Yeah, me too.

30:29.600 --> 30:33.500
But I'm probably crying because I'm friends with everybody.

30:34.700 --> 30:38.200
What could you not understand me?

30:43.800 --> 30:44.600
Oh, I'm Alan.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.100
Fuck.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.000
Yeah, you keep doing it.

30:47.000 --> 30:47.700
Fuck.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.200
My name is Alan.

30:49.200 --> 30:49.900
Fuck.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.400
That's my favorite RnB.

30:53.200 --> 30:53.800
Oh my God.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.000
That would be such a fucking good name for a musician.

30:57.000 --> 30:57.900
His son Robin.

30:57.900 --> 30:58.800
Fuck Robin.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.300
Fuck it.

30:59.300 --> 31:00.900
Yeah, he's done.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.500
He's over.

31:01.700 --> 31:02.900
All right, you guys ready for this?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.500
Yeah, no, maybe wait.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.700
No, no, no, he's spookified the room.

31:08.900 --> 31:13.200
The room is blue Roger Fairfield and Charles Digby are together

31:13.200 --> 31:14.000
in a canoe.

31:14.300 --> 31:17.400
Walter and Alan Grimes are together in a canoe.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.500
Bradley Cooper.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.500
You're in a canoe with Jack Russell.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.800
I reach back and scratches fluffy eyes.

31:23.800 --> 31:29.500
So you're all paddling aggressively teeth clenched tight desperately

31:29.500 --> 31:33.500
trying to get to the other side of Lake calm and behind you

31:33.600 --> 31:39.900
you hear a scoop as something massive and dense dips back

31:39.900 --> 31:46.100
down into the brackish waters of Lake calm Walter Walter.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.100
We gotta get out of here.

31:47.200 --> 31:51.000
I paddle I'd like to use an athletics check to row harder

31:51.000 --> 31:51.500
than them.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.200
Fantastic.

31:52.200 --> 31:52.600
Yes.

31:53.100 --> 31:57.000
Let's go ahead and have an athletics competition between

31:57.000 --> 32:00.100
these three canoes to see who gets in the lead and who

32:00.100 --> 32:08.500
is left behind 91 Jack slows us down 28 on a 30 for and

32:08.500 --> 32:09.900
then I roll the five.

32:10.400 --> 32:15.700
I failed a 56 on a 30 Walter and Alan Grimes are 20 yards

32:15.700 --> 32:19.200
ahead of everyone else and then in the very back is going

32:19.200 --> 32:22.600
to be Bradley Cooper and Jack Russell and the other four

32:22.600 --> 32:25.600
of you do not look back as you just continue to paddle

32:25.600 --> 32:28.300
and paddle and paddle and you're freaking the fuck out.

32:28.300 --> 32:29.000
We're panicked.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.100
Oh, yeah, okay, Walter.

32:30.100 --> 32:30.900
Don't look back.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.300
Just keep paddling and Walter is getting it like he put

32:35.300 --> 32:38.900
you in the back because of your just innate athleticism

32:38.900 --> 32:42.700
and you are side to side side to side just paddling paddling

32:42.700 --> 32:47.200
so smooth into these dark waters and you are flying towards

32:47.600 --> 32:52.900
the green trees ahead in the shoreline that is approaching

32:53.100 --> 32:55.800
and behind you guys hear Jack Russell.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.100
Wait, nope.

33:09.600 --> 33:13.400
Bradley nope, you're close Bradley Cooper.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.900
I can't I can't row anymore.

33:16.000 --> 33:21.300
You'll row to save my life or I'll fucking kill you Bradley

33:21.300 --> 33:26.000
Cooper Charles Digby Walter and Alan Grimes and Roger Fairfield.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.300
You are all standing in a Spartan and sterile room filled

33:30.300 --> 33:35.900
with shelves and oddly lit by the floor the ceiling above

33:35.900 --> 33:40.300
you is dark with the shadows cast by rows and rows of metal

33:40.300 --> 33:44.600
shelves the floor is emanating bright white LED lighting

33:44.600 --> 33:48.700
this room may not be infinite, but you can't see a wall

33:48.700 --> 33:50.000
in any direction.

33:50.200 --> 33:55.100
The shelves are filled with cassette tapes each has a name

33:55.200 --> 33:57.900
and a number they're grouped together five to seven people

33:57.900 --> 34:03.000
at a time and most numbers go up from one to four so anywhere

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
from five to 30 tapes per grouping.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.600
There were names.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.100
Yeah, there's names on the on the cassette tapes.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.300
I want to read a couple.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, absolutely.

34:12.000 --> 34:22.000
So everyone go ahead and roll intelligence pass pass a 59

34:22.000 --> 34:27.400
on a 75 48 on a 65 pass 54 on 60.

34:27.400 --> 34:31.000
Okay, so everyone passes so you guys are going to recognize

34:31.400 --> 34:38.100
the names of many politicians CEOs activists journalists

34:38.100 --> 34:40.600
religious figures Etc.

34:40.700 --> 34:43.200
There's a bunch of different names, but and you don't recognize

34:43.200 --> 34:43.900
all of them.

34:44.100 --> 34:46.200
But because you guys know say excedrin.

34:46.600 --> 34:53.800
Yeah, excedrin excedrin migraine our new sponsor like the

34:53.800 --> 34:58.100

34:58.100 --> 35:00.800
just like looking through and you're recognizing about half

35:00.800 --> 35:04.000
the names you come across and I know that guy see exactly

35:06.600 --> 35:07.700
everyone roll luck.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.000
I don't think we gave these characters love scores.

35:11.000 --> 35:11.900
So we'll give them 50.

35:11.900 --> 35:18.400
Okay pass fail fail all under over under 50 pass pass

35:18.700 --> 35:19.600
crit fail.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.100
All right.

35:20.100 --> 35:24.400
So Walter as you're looking around you find everyone roll

35:24.400 --> 35:29.200
search while I'm telling hey Joe, what are Clark Bishop's

35:29.200 --> 35:30.000
parents names?

35:31.900 --> 35:33.100
Have we said no.

35:33.300 --> 35:40.000
Oh, then it's a Jerry and Eunice Jerry and Eunice Bishop

35:40.000 --> 35:41.200
are both found.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.300
I don't know that guy.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.300
That's not for you guys.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.200
That's just for the listeners and then who passed search

35:46.200 --> 35:48.600
checks all of us, but Jeff, okay, fantastic.

35:48.600 --> 35:54.400
So you guys find a shelf that has the same name over and

35:54.400 --> 35:58.500
over and over on every tape hundreds is it Jack Russell

35:58.500 --> 36:02.300
and it's Jack Russell the next shelf over has even more tapes

36:02.300 --> 36:03.400
with the same name.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.500
This was where I was going to say Jack Russell, right?

36:06.500 --> 36:09.800
Yeah, if I had to guess I'd say there's about five or four

36:09.800 --> 36:12.900
missing and I pulled them out of my pockets when you reach

36:12.900 --> 36:13.800
into your pockets.

36:13.800 --> 36:17.000
They're not there damn and you see then the numbers that

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
you think should be there are in the shelf.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.300
Well funny story guys.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.300
I've seen these tapes before they were hidden in my room

36:24.700 --> 36:28.300
along with what seemed like basically some some get out

36:28.300 --> 36:32.200
and go shit the Jack had do our characters have any

36:32.400 --> 36:34.500
feeling about suddenly being here.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.400
Do we are we aware that this all of a sudden has happened

36:37.400 --> 36:38.900
that we have happened to do this place.

36:38.900 --> 36:43.300
This feels like a memory that is happening in the future

36:43.300 --> 36:44.700
and you're living it now.

36:45.100 --> 36:45.700
Wow.

36:46.000 --> 36:46.400
Okay.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.500
Did you did you get a chance to look at the tapes?

36:49.500 --> 36:50.200
What's on the tapes?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.500
No, I couldn't find the weird metallic again.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.200
I figured he might have a Walkman there wasn't really one

36:55.200 --> 36:56.200
around anywhere else.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.100
Don't talk about my son ever again.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.100
What else was in the go bag two things don't talk to my

37:01.100 --> 37:02.600
son ever again and what's in the go back.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.300
I saw you tell your father not to talk to me kid.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.900
I saw get on my nerves.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.800
You had a map in the bag.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.400
Yeah, I saw that.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.100
How'd you see that your cabins on our TV?

37:13.200 --> 37:16.600
We were changing the channels on the TV and we saw the inside

37:16.600 --> 37:17.400
of your cabin.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.600
That's a gross invasion.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Did you see anything related to the proprietary development

37:23.000 --> 37:25.900
of Cube Walter now and look at each other with wide eyes

37:25.900 --> 37:27.600
like Luke and Zach are doing right now.

37:28.100 --> 37:30.500
No, no, no good good.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.900
You've never heard of Cube.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.300
You wouldn't understand it if you saw it.

37:34.300 --> 37:34.800
What now?

37:34.800 --> 37:35.900
Let's shut up.

37:35.900 --> 37:40.200
What's at the northeast part of the map the door explain

37:40.200 --> 37:40.800
the door.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.100
It just says the door where on the map the northeast side

37:44.100 --> 37:45.400
Roger raises his hand.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.800
I'm playing catch up here.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.400
What what's going on?

37:48.500 --> 37:52.600
He pointed at the northeast part of the map on on our TV.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
Yeah, what was the map?

37:53.700 --> 37:57.700
The map is a map of this place come comfy campgrounds looked

37:57.700 --> 37:59.800
like maybe Jack had written it up.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.500
He marked a trail that led out of here to the door.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.700
Are we sure we're in calm comfy campgrounds right now?

38:08.900 --> 38:10.400
Everyone looks at each other.

38:10.900 --> 38:12.300
How rustic is this room?

38:15.300 --> 38:19.500
It is neither rustic nor elegant for these tapes video tapes

38:19.500 --> 38:21.100
or cassette audio cassette.

38:21.100 --> 38:21.600
Okay.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.400
Is there a tape player in here looking around you just see

38:24.400 --> 38:27.600
shelves shelves and shelves and shelves Alan when you were

38:27.700 --> 38:28.700
looking through your TV.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.100
Did you see an image of the woods?

38:31.600 --> 38:32.600
I don't believe so.

38:32.600 --> 38:37.300
No, no, we watched Wheel of Fortune for one clue and then

38:37.300 --> 38:39.900
we what was the clue beer-battered shrimp?

38:43.000 --> 38:43.500
Excuse me.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
It was beer-battered rock shrimp.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.100
There it is.

38:47.600 --> 38:48.800
It's very important to the plot.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.700
So I just thought it might be the episode that in the that

38:52.700 --> 38:53.300
would have been cool.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.300
Yeah, kind of kind of insane.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.000
You didn't do that.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.200
It was just Luke's improv.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.800
So don't well, I had watched well looks a bad deal.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.400
I had watched Wheel of Fortune and that was one of the clues

39:07.400 --> 39:10.600
in my mind beer-battered rock shrimp.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.000
Yeah, that sounds good.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.600
It does Alan.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.200
How many other cameras do you think you saw on the TV?

39:18.700 --> 39:20.300
We turned it off.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.300
So just the one.

39:21.400 --> 39:21.800
Yeah.

39:22.200 --> 39:22.600
Okay.

39:22.800 --> 39:26.100
I saw a camera in the forest whenever I was doing a little

39:26.700 --> 39:28.000
investigating.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.700
Let's call it.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.500
Can you elaborate on your investigation?

39:31.800 --> 39:35.600
That was just, you know, wandering about looking for stuff.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.700
You saw a camera?

39:36.800 --> 39:38.000
There was a camera up in a tree.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.300
I couldn't get up to it though, but I was curious why it

39:41.300 --> 39:41.600
was there.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.600
I thought maybe it was to look out for wild animals or

39:44.600 --> 39:45.100
something.

39:45.100 --> 39:48.000
But if it's in one of our rooms, it could have been in all

39:48.000 --> 39:48.900
of our rooms.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.400
I didn't even notice that I had a TV.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.600
I don't own a TV at home.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.100
Very cool.

39:56.900 --> 39:57.500
Wow.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.600
I want to be friends with you.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.800
Full, I'm full.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.100
All my spots are full.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.200
Listen, while we're talking about what we did while we were

40:08.200 --> 40:09.000
exploring.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.700
I took a canoe out alone on the lake.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.400
But we're not supposed to do that.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.600
I can handle it.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.200
Okay.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.800
There's some kind of lake monster.

40:17.800 --> 40:18.400
That's all.

40:18.400 --> 40:23.300
Of a lake a lake monster.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.100
Yeah, some creature in the lake.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.200
Did you see it?

40:26.300 --> 40:26.900
I heard it.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.900
I saw its form underwater is Jack in the room with us, right?

40:29.900 --> 40:33.800
Jack is not and Alan Grimes speaks up and is like but but

40:33.800 --> 40:35.900
Jack said that there aren't fish in the lake.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.300
Yeah, probably cuz this thing ate him.

40:40.300 --> 40:43.500
Charles Digby gets or maybe so we didn't catch this thing.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.800
He gets a little no-putt out and does a little some little

40:45.800 --> 40:48.200
Scribbies Zach just smiled like I was right.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.700
We need to go fishing for a fish man.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.600
Is a is Angela in the room?

40:53.600 --> 40:54.700
No, hmm.

40:55.300 --> 40:59.500
Wait, where's Angela?

40:59.600 --> 41:00.500
Where's your wife?

41:00.500 --> 41:02.800
She's probably smoking a joint because she's cool Angela.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.300
She's right.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.400
Oh and it and Angie Angie.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.100
How many tapes have Angela written on them?

41:09.200 --> 41:13.700
You guys actually immediately thereafter stumble upon a group.

41:13.700 --> 41:18.900
The names are Charles Digby Roger Fairfield Alan Grimes

41:19.100 --> 41:21.900
Walter Grimes and Martin Cupertino.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.600
How many of each of those names?

41:26.100 --> 41:27.200
More than four.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.500
Did you say there was hundreds with Jack Russell?

41:29.600 --> 41:30.100
Yeah.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.900
Yeah, the ones in my cabin were like from the 580s.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.400
Wow, your group has maybe 12.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.800
Well, it seems like we've been repeating this experience for

41:37.900 --> 41:40.900
not as long as say poor Jack Russell.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.600
What do you what do you mean repeat repeating?

41:43.600 --> 41:44.100
What is that?

41:44.200 --> 41:46.100
I mean, doesn't that seem like what's going on here?

41:46.200 --> 41:47.500
Have you been here before?

41:47.700 --> 41:49.700
Haven't we look we've been here 12 times.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.000
How did you come to that?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.300
Why would that be a thing that you think of?

41:53.500 --> 41:56.100
I mean remember like just a second ago when we were all

41:56.100 --> 41:58.500
running for our lives in the canoe and then a second before

41:58.500 --> 42:00.200
that when we were here at our first day.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.500
Is that how it would feel to us?

42:01.600 --> 42:04.400
All the memories are starting to just swirl together.

42:04.500 --> 42:05.600
I remember the boats of Charles.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.700
We were in a boat together.

42:06.700 --> 42:10.600
That was yeah, I think was that that did I mean that happened?

42:10.700 --> 42:13.500
I remember I think I remember remember I did it.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.400
I don't know Charles Digby is very fucked up right now.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
It doesn't make sense.

42:18.900 --> 42:19.700
Look at look at the tapes.

42:19.700 --> 42:20.700
There's a Martin here.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.400
Who's who's Martin Cupertino?

42:25.900 --> 42:27.200
I'm Martin Cupertino.

42:27.900 --> 42:28.800
Yeah, that's right.

42:28.900 --> 42:32.400
You're the Martin Cupertino Silicon Valley.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.600
Philip billionaire.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.600
What a billionaire.

42:36.000 --> 42:36.600
It's a toy.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.500
That's a term I coined myself.

42:40.500 --> 42:44.100
Would Roger have knowledge of that name and that person?

42:44.200 --> 42:47.400
I think everyone would Oh ever used email.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.200
I've heard of this.

42:54.700 --> 42:57.200
Yeah, it sounds very futuristic.

42:57.300 --> 43:00.700
It's very lucrative as are the other things my company develops

43:01.100 --> 43:03.700
but wait, why did you tell us that your name was Bradley Cooper?

43:03.700 --> 43:06.500
I don't I'm a celebrity at a health resort.

43:06.500 --> 43:11.300
I was trying to pick a non-famous inconspicuous name.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
And Bradley Cooper seems like a pretty standard, you know,

43:17.000 --> 43:19.800
boring white guys name for boring definitely mid-90s.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.000
Very boring picked a great name.

43:21.000 --> 43:21.500
Yeah.

43:21.600 --> 43:22.000
Yeah.

43:22.000 --> 43:22.300
Yeah.

43:22.300 --> 43:23.600
Yeah, I hate that name.

43:24.600 --> 43:29.000
I think I think he's charming but yeah, maybe he's a little

43:29.000 --> 43:30.200
limited in his range.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.000
But he does what he does.

43:36.400 --> 43:36.700
Right.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.100
Yeah, I mean fun.

43:38.100 --> 43:39.500
He was a raccoon guy.

43:40.800 --> 43:41.800
That's some rain.

43:43.100 --> 43:45.900
Just like Vin Diesel's a tree anyway.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.800
We're launching our next big product Cube.

43:51.100 --> 43:52.600
You guys will own one soon.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.400
You'll have to what does it do?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.100
What doesn't it do?

43:57.500 --> 43:58.200
Not much.

43:58.700 --> 44:01.800
It doesn't not do much because it does nearly everything.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.000
Do you like your Walkman?

44:03.100 --> 44:04.900
Do you all like the Walkman that you own?

44:05.100 --> 44:05.900
I do sure.

44:06.400 --> 44:10.500
Yeah, well, it'll do that but email to and other things spreadsheets.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.100
Yeah, you know what a personal computer is, right?

44:13.300 --> 44:13.700
Yeah.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.800
This is that but it looks like a jellybean kind of it's real

44:16.800 --> 44:17.500
fanciful.

44:17.800 --> 44:18.500
Can it fax?

44:19.500 --> 44:20.600
No, that's a fax machine.

44:20.800 --> 44:24.800
Oh dang, so it doesn't do everything.

44:25.500 --> 44:29.100
It doesn't do what is no longer needed.

44:29.100 --> 44:33.700
Listen, if people would adapt to do Technologies when they

44:33.700 --> 44:37.800
come out, we wouldn't be burdened with this inefficiency

44:37.900 --> 44:40.900
that plagues our system people would get things done.

44:40.900 --> 44:43.800
They would have the answers to all of life's problems in

44:43.800 --> 44:44.700
their hands.

44:44.900 --> 44:46.100
That's why I'm here.

44:46.300 --> 44:50.100
I'm trying to figure this out for all of you fucking people

44:50.100 --> 44:54.600
in this world, but if it can't fax, I mean speaking of Technologies

44:54.600 --> 44:59.900
is adopting Luke roll luck on a 50 to see if you have a cassette

44:59.900 --> 45:01.700
Walkman with I don't bummer town.

45:01.700 --> 45:02.500
That would have been fun.

45:04.100 --> 45:08.500
I I go over to Alan and whisper in his ear.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.700
Am I cube?

45:19.500 --> 45:20.400
You can fax.

45:22.700 --> 45:24.800
Okay, wait.

45:24.800 --> 45:25.800
So the boy is a machine.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.000
He's a weird machine boy.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.000
No, yeah, I whispered that in his ear.

45:29.000 --> 45:29.900
She didn't hear it.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.500
Roll it in Thomas.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.600
Seven you heard it you there boy.

45:38.900 --> 45:39.900
Why'd you say that?

45:40.100 --> 45:41.500
Are you some kind of machine boy?

45:41.600 --> 45:42.600
He's just a boy.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.700
I'm just a boy a mechanical boy.

45:44.700 --> 45:45.900
He's just a boy.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.600
Yeah, I know you think that I see a very smart bright man

45:51.100 --> 45:53.300
who has a great feature ahead of him roll humid.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.100
23 he's fucking lying.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.100
Oh, you're lying.

45:57.100 --> 45:57.900
He's not a boy.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.200
He's a mechanical boy.

45:59.900 --> 46:07.500
So Roger at not having heard the whisper mechanical boy.

46:07.500 --> 46:12.300
What my start I start like looking you up and down and

46:12.300 --> 46:18.300
I'm like we have to integrate this into Cube my Walter's

46:18.300 --> 46:22.600
face looks like it's crying but oil comes out.

46:22.600 --> 46:22.800
Yeah.

46:24.100 --> 46:26.300
No, it's just this nothing sailing solution.

46:26.300 --> 46:26.800
Nothing.

46:26.800 --> 46:28.200
Nothing comes out.

46:28.300 --> 46:29.800
He's just crying dry cry.

46:29.800 --> 46:30.300
Try cry.

46:30.300 --> 46:31.300
I'm trying to hide it.

46:31.700 --> 46:32.900
But is it ugly?

46:32.900 --> 46:35.000
Well Walter, you could be the most important boy on the

46:35.000 --> 46:39.300
face of this planet Solomon and quite feel a little bad.

46:39.300 --> 46:44.600
Now Angela Angie, where did she where did she go?

46:44.700 --> 46:46.300
Hey, I think she's not here.

46:46.600 --> 46:47.800
I put my hand on her shoulder.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.600
I'm like calm down.

46:48.700 --> 46:49.900
We need to figure this out.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.400
I just want to know where my wife is.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.300
I Angela's name was not in our batch, right?

46:53.400 --> 46:56.100
It was not not in the budget are collected tapes.

46:56.100 --> 46:56.800
That is correct.

46:57.800 --> 46:59.900
Hey Angela's name isn't here.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.400
Is there any other machinery around here consoles any kind

47:06.400 --> 47:09.800
of shelves on shelves baby on shelves and just white light

47:09.800 --> 47:14.200
underneath can I can I look around Jack Russell's cubbyhole?

47:14.200 --> 47:17.400
Are there other names there that we would know Jack Russell

47:17.400 --> 47:21.200
has two full shelves like all to himself standing next to

47:21.200 --> 47:24.000
each other but then past that it's all the same as normal

47:24.000 --> 47:25.800
but I was getting at it since our names are all grouped

47:25.800 --> 47:26.400
together.

47:26.500 --> 47:28.600
I wondered if he was grouped together with somebody that

47:28.600 --> 47:31.200
he is close to or something seemingly not.

47:31.200 --> 47:31.500
Okay.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.000
I want to grab one of the tapes.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.800
Do they have any like titles or anything on her?

47:34.800 --> 47:37.000
Is it just our names and numbers names and numbers?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.500
Is there a brand on the cassette?

47:38.500 --> 47:40.900
Oh, there's just a symbol.

47:41.700 --> 47:46.400
It's a circle with six smaller circles surrounding it dope.

47:47.600 --> 47:48.600
I don't know what that means.

47:51.100 --> 47:55.200
Use my detective instance circle seems smart like it's a

47:55.200 --> 47:59.700
circle of knowing things to be known.

48:26.200 --> 48:36.800
I knew I'd make you be foolish corner room and it was

48:36.800 --> 48:50.300
right you made me crazy baby this is real life

48:50.300 --> 49:00.300
I think

49:50.300 --> 50:00.300
Oh

50:20.300 --> 50:30.300
Oh

50:50.300 --> 51:00.300
Oh

51:20.300 --> 51:22.300
Oh
