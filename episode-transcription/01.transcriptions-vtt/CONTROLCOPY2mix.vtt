00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
This is yet another introduction to the show known as PTBP.

00:06.280 --> 00:10.680
The good numbers follow, 694.2.

00:10.680 --> 00:16.960
I'm Wolf the dog, the dog father, the dog mother, the dog puppy.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.560
Many more nicknames follow.

00:19.560 --> 00:27.000
I'm glad you can be here with us today, whatever today is, whenever today is.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.320
And speaking of today, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dean in the UK.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.000
Dean writes,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.760
Hello Mr. Wolf.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.080
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

00:39.080 --> 00:42.600
It's time for more sickly sweet dumps to dive in.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.400
Anyway, enough about my weekend.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.760
I just wanted to give a big shout out to the fine fellas from Contention

00:49.760 --> 00:53.440
doing their absolute best to keep us safe and sane.

00:53.440 --> 01:01.440
You, yes you too, Mr. Wolf, have brought such joy, delight, and revulsion into my life.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.440
And I couldn't be happier.

01:03.440 --> 01:09.040
Just a shout out to my wife, Ellen, for trusting in me and listening to the show.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.680
Two avid listeners from the UK.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.360
Much love, y'all.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.040
Signed, Dean, a fool.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.360
Well, hello Dean, if that is your real name.

01:21.360 --> 01:27.680
I'm glad you forced our show upon your spouse, Ellen, if that is her real name.

01:27.680 --> 01:34.960
And do us all a favor and keep converting more and more people to be disciples of the wolf, the dog.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.240
If you want to write up something for your dog mother to howl,

01:38.240 --> 01:43.200
please submit your memorandum as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.680
And I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP.

01:47.680 --> 01:53.120
Ocean City, New Jersey's sloppiest and creamiest radio station.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.200
Would you like that, dear listener?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.680
Either way, I got some news for you.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.840
It's time for the news.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.560
In the early morning of March 22nd, Daniel M. White,

02:04.560 --> 02:10.240
an active Delta Green agent and the former partner of Arvon Chilton,

02:10.240 --> 02:15.760
received a phone call at 4.55 AM from an unknown number.

02:15.760 --> 02:21.200
Neighbors in his apartment complex reported they heard shouting, then weeping,

02:21.200 --> 02:27.520
and finally watched as Arvon Chilton chased Daniel White from the building.

02:27.520 --> 02:34.000
White was found by a jogger three hours later on a trail behind the apartments.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.520
He had been stabbed 25 times and his eyes had been meticulously cut out.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.160
Neither of his eyes had been located.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.160
The McCarty case and the White case was soon connected.

02:46.160 --> 02:51.920
Arvon Chilton is still at large and he is still dangerous.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.920
I've got to make a quick correction here as I drop this next track.

02:55.920 --> 03:05.120
Last time, I said Brian Bolger, bowl like a bowl of slop and grr like an upset dog.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.640
But I have since realized his name is Brian Bolger,

03:09.280 --> 03:14.960
bowl like load one up and grr like the prefix to cough.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.400
So go ahead, load a bowl and jerk off.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.320
It's Brian Bolger with Bad in a Good Way.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.880
And the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind.

03:44.880 --> 03:53.040
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

03:53.040 --> 04:00.480
I'll be alright, I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

04:00.480 --> 04:08.720
Alexander Duchene looks at Agent Sparrow.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.760
He is 79 years of age.

04:11.760 --> 04:18.320
He is clothed in old often mended clothing and a pork pie hat.

04:19.280 --> 04:26.320
And he has a long winding scar up the right half of his face.

04:26.320 --> 04:33.360
It's clear that he drinks due to the large nose with burst capillaries,

04:33.360 --> 04:39.920
just filling this big, almost like pulsating thing on the tip of his nose.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.680
And he moves slowly, seemingly with great pain,

04:43.680 --> 04:46.800
as he kind of like pops his head around the side and is like,

04:49.760 --> 04:53.440
Arvin said that it would be fitting.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.840
And as he says that, a massive thunderclap hits

04:57.840 --> 05:00.800
and rain starts to begin pouring down outside

05:00.800 --> 05:03.280
and you can see it drizzling through the window.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.160
Can I do an intelligence check about what As You Like It's about?

05:06.160 --> 05:06.800
Sure, yeah.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.960
I hope you pass before he does, well...

05:14.000 --> 05:16.400
I pass with an 84 on an 85.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.680
Shit, amazing.

05:19.680 --> 05:26.400
Before anybody clarifies what it is, Agent Sparrow, Sparrow Agnew,

05:29.360 --> 05:30.960
Agent Sparrow wants to ask,

05:30.960 --> 05:32.240
and have you read it?

05:32.240 --> 05:33.520
Did you find it to be fitting?

05:36.320 --> 05:37.680
I haven't had time.

05:37.680 --> 05:42.720
I just, I haven't had any time.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.160
Do you know what he found?

05:44.960 --> 05:45.840
Did he clarify?

05:45.840 --> 05:47.280
Why do you think he found it fitting?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.000
I don't know.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.160
People who are into that kind of thing, you know, they're nerds.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.400
And I'm not really much of a reader.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.640
Elwood kind of perks up at the idea of nerd, nerdom.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.120
I am.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.400
I've read it.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.200
I've read them all.

06:05.200 --> 06:05.840
All?

06:05.840 --> 06:06.720
All of Shakespeare.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.840
So what's it about?

06:07.840 --> 06:13.200
Well, it boils down to a bunch of people were pretending to be other people.

06:13.200 --> 06:13.760
Yeah.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.720
That does sound fitting.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.440
People pretending to be people.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.040
That's the gist of it.

06:21.040 --> 06:21.200
Yeah.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.840
That's how it works.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.400
Agent Sparrow, your phone starts ringing.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.240
It is the Ocean City Police Department.

06:32.240 --> 06:32.720
Uh, yeah.

06:32.720 --> 06:38.560
Hey, uh, Agent Sparrow, Detective Quinlan is actually back from lunch and she's interested

06:38.560 --> 06:39.360
in talking to you guys.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.600
She's the Newark police on the case.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.080
All right.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.760
Please tell her we'll be there soon.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.560
Thank you.

06:45.040 --> 06:51.600
Do you have any other questions for an old man before you go out?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.000
Really?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.920
I must insist.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
Arvin is innocent.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.480
How long did Arvin live here with you?

06:58.480 --> 06:59.200
Five years.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.360
Did he have a key to your apartment?

07:01.360 --> 07:02.080
Yes.

07:02.080 --> 07:02.720
Yes.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.160
Maybe we should look around to see if he hid anything in here.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.960
If he hid anything in here?

07:08.960 --> 07:14.080
And he looks around at the place and he's like, no, I don't think Arvin would have

07:14.800 --> 07:16.800
hid anything in my apartment.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.080
It's always a possibility.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.040
So if you don't mind, my associates are going to start looking around.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.000
Um, while they do that, would you tell me the significance of these baseballs?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.120
Oh, uh, yes.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.440
I'm a big fan.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.480
Who's your favorite team?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.360
Yankees.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.240
Where do they play?

07:32.240 --> 07:33.280
The New York.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.240
The new one.

07:34.240 --> 07:34.720
That's right.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.880
Did you play baseball as a child?

07:38.880 --> 07:39.520
Who didn't?

07:40.880 --> 07:41.600
Did you?

07:41.600 --> 07:41.840
Yes.

07:42.800 --> 07:43.280
All right.

07:43.280 --> 07:43.840
Were you good?

07:45.440 --> 07:50.480
Hey, you look at this like five foot seven, 210 pound man.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.800
And he's just like, no.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.920
I was a bit of a ball magnet crowd, the plate and hope they hit me.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.560
Cause I wasn't much of a contact hitter.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.960
I don't know much about sports.

08:06.960 --> 08:12.160
I find that they take away from value funds that could be applied to youth academics.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.400
He rolls his eyes at Elwood.

08:17.120 --> 08:22.160
I think Elwood would kind of agree with this.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.640
He's like wanting some sort of, you know, camaraderie there.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.280
Not getting it.

08:28.320 --> 08:28.640
Okay.

08:28.640 --> 08:34.640
Well, you guys should go on out and, um, you know, take, take your call, talk to whoever

08:34.640 --> 08:39.360
you want to, but keep in mind, you should be looking for someone who is not Chilton.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.280
There's a, there's been a change in the voice.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.880
Do we clock that or is that Zach?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.800
He will human.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.300
Okay.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.760
That's a 100.

08:51.760 --> 08:55.120
Oh yeah.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.680
There's clearly something wrong.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.160
There's clearly something wrong with this old man.

09:04.640 --> 09:07.360
You're like convinced now with a fail.

09:07.360 --> 09:10.560
Could I ask him, do you have something in your throat?

09:11.280 --> 09:14.720
Yeah, yeah.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.760
It's been allergies, spring allergies.

09:17.760 --> 09:18.640
They come in.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.400
It makes me talk weird.

09:20.400 --> 09:20.800
I know.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.280
I'm sorry.

09:22.960 --> 09:28.400
That's seasonally appropriate, but no, this is what I always sound like in spring.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.400
I can hear glimpses of your, the voice we heard you with before peek through.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.320
It sounds like it's kind of come over you.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.360
It's up here.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.320
It's it's still here.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.360
This is when I'm like really trying to hold back a cough.

09:41.360 --> 09:47.920
And then down here is more so when I feel more comfortable, but I'm holding in a cough.

09:47.920 --> 09:54.000
If I accidentally cough, I might have an accident if I'm being honest.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.120
And I just don't like wearing them.

09:57.120 --> 09:57.920
The diapers.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.480
You're saying you suffer from incontinence, sir?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.040
Yeah.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.640
The bandages smell.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.040
Do we see bandages on him?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.960
No, he's well covered up though.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.280
He, uh, he's wearing like a long sleeved shirt and pants.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.880
And if I did like a medicine roll, do you think I could determine maybe what caused his scar?

10:19.680 --> 10:21.040
Yeah, go ahead and roll medicine.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.440
36 on a 60.

10:23.440 --> 10:23.760
Okay.

10:23.760 --> 10:29.760
Uh, yeah, it seems to have come from you think maybe some piece of metal.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.920
How'd you get that scar, Mr. Duchesne?

10:31.920 --> 10:34.480
How did I get these, this scar?

10:37.600 --> 10:39.440
Uh, a horse.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.400
A horse.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.520
I fell off a horse.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.320
Of course.

10:42.320 --> 10:42.880
On two.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.440
I fell.

10:43.440 --> 10:50.560
And as I was falling, I got, I got kind of, you know, that, that horse kind of BDSM stuff

10:50.560 --> 10:51.200
that they wear.

10:54.160 --> 10:54.660
Yeah.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.960
I think it's called Tack.

10:56.960 --> 10:57.600
Tack, yeah.

10:57.600 --> 10:57.840
Yeah.

10:57.840 --> 11:04.800
Uh, there is a slice of metal, uh, you know, kind of shanked off the side and it got me

11:04.800 --> 11:06.080
as I fell off.

11:06.080 --> 11:06.960
Can I humid that?

11:06.960 --> 11:07.460
Yeah.

11:10.160 --> 11:10.960
One.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.680
Oh yeah.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.040
This is a lie.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
Why are you lying to me, Mr. Duchesne?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.800
His face gets super serious.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.480
As you look into his eyes, he looks past you.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.000
Who are you?

11:22.560 --> 11:23.200
Who are you?

11:25.280 --> 11:26.800
Why are you in my house?

11:26.800 --> 11:27.920
Kevin gets scared.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.920
Special agent Clarissa Sparrow.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.640
And he's like kind of shuddering and hiding from you a little bit.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.440
And he's like, get out.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.200
Get out of my house.

11:38.320 --> 11:38.960
Get out.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.800
You invited us in Mr. Duchesne.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.520
Okay.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.680
I'm just not comfortable right now.

11:43.680 --> 11:44.800
Please leave.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.840
Please leave.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.880
Now you meant that.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.380
Yeah.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.600
20.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.100
Pass.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.080
He's fucking with you.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.240
You can drop the act, Mr. Duchesne.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.520
What, what, what act?

11:56.080 --> 11:56.640
This act.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.760
Something about my line of questioning has made you uncomfortable.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.760
And then you lied to her about the scar.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.440
And I kind of make eyes at Kevin.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.400
He starts weeping.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.280
Kevin puts his hand on Duchesne's shoulder.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.880
Not like to hurt him, but like it is shoulders.

12:10.880 --> 12:17.040
Like it covers his hands kind of like around the back of his neck and on his shoulders.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.960
My memory is so good.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.800
Stop crying.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.200
It is.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.080
Mr. Duchesne.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.920
My memory is just so shy.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.800
I want to tell you that I don't know.

12:31.520 --> 12:32.560
I don't know.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.840
Not to just keep going at him at that.

12:35.840 --> 12:36.340
Yeah.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.180
12.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.560
He is telling the truth.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.720
He does not remember how he got this scar.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.280
Mr. Duchesne, you have some problems with your memory.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.680
Please have, have an olive.

12:57.680 --> 13:04.800
She sees that he's like got his eyes clenched with tears and she kind of like motions to

13:04.800 --> 13:06.720
plop one in her mouth and just throws it behind her back.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.240
All right.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.480
I accept your hospitality, Mr. Duchesne.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.680
Thank you very much for that.

13:14.640 --> 13:15.840
Have a good day.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.960
Thank you for your spread.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.480
Have a good day.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.960
And you guys head back to the Ocean City Police Department.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.840
Can I ask real fast when, when he passed his medicine,

13:25.840 --> 13:29.280
could he maybe have gotten like a timeline on how old the scar is?

13:29.280 --> 13:30.320
Yeah, that's a good question.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.440
That is a good question.

13:35.280 --> 13:40.400
Probably that scar happened when he was still growing.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.120
Okay, cool.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.600
So definitely childhood or early childhood.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.240
Okay.

13:44.240 --> 13:44.480
All right.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.000
Yeah, I think we're.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.120
So back at the PD.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.400
Going back to the police department.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.400
We've got to meet the Newark Police Department.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.440
Well, she was detective, right?

13:51.440 --> 13:53.920
Detective Mara Quinlan.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.520
And she's PD, not.

13:55.520 --> 13:56.320
She is PD.

13:56.320 --> 13:56.560
Yeah.

13:56.560 --> 14:03.280
And when you guys arrive, the woman at the front desk points you off to a separate hallway

14:03.280 --> 14:08.800
where Quinlan is set up in a smaller room than the FBI.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.680
The FBI guy was set up in this big conference room with an entire conference table,

14:13.680 --> 14:15.040
and he's sitting at it by himself.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.320
And Mara Quinlan is in a closet.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.280
This is not her department, her police department.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.720
No, she's from Newark, but she's been brought in because

14:24.720 --> 14:27.040
part of the case took place in her jurisdiction.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.880
So there's some cross lines.

14:29.520 --> 14:35.120
When you open up this small closet, you see an immaculately dressed police officer.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.840
Her hair is done very, very neatly.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.960
Her makeup is done very neatly.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.120
Her nails are done very neatly.

14:43.120 --> 14:47.600
She's just a very well put together person and professionally addresses you

14:47.600 --> 14:48.720
when you enter the room.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.040
She says, Hello, Mara Quinlan, detective, Newark PD.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.680
Nice to meet the FBI on this case.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.920
Before they can say anything or like extend a mannae's hand.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.040
Sparrow's very quickly like, Pleasure to meet you, Detective Quinlan.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.000
Pleasure's on my agent.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.120
Agent Clarissa Sparrow.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.160
These are my associates.

15:06.160 --> 15:06.640
Sparrow.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.440
Agent Boyd.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.160
Hi, Kevin.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.560
Agent Kevin.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.680
Elwood just nods.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.640
Okay, I learned that you guys already spoke to Garza.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.280
Is that right?

15:15.280 --> 15:15.840
Yeah.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.120
The stinky fat guy.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.420
That's her.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.240
She like laughs.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.720
Clarissa elbows you hard.

15:23.760 --> 15:29.120
She laughs and she's like, Yeah, you know, he seems like a nice guy.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.640
I don't think he's on the right path with this case, by the way.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.320
Like his whole idea that it's a kidnapping thing.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.520
I'm not for that.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.960
I think that this is a crime of passion clearly committed by Chilton.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.240
Eileen McCarty is the body who died in her own home.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.400
Her husband is the body that died in his own home.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.840
We don't really have much of a budding of heads between me and...

15:53.840 --> 15:57.760
She rolls her eyes real big and says, Uncle Jimmy.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.280
You know, it'll be fine.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.480
He's a good guy.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.760
I think that he's got a good head on his shoulders.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.960
I just disagree with him.

16:04.960 --> 16:09.360
How does the gas station attendant figure into your crime of passion idea?

16:09.360 --> 16:15.440
These are not murders committed by a person who has all of their faculties about them.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.440
You've seen the crime scene photos.

16:17.440 --> 16:23.040
I mean, the medical examiner even said quote and she reaches through some papers and grabs

16:23.040 --> 16:24.480
one and pulls up.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.920
I'll be damned if I know what's going on.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.080
There's just there's anomalies all over the place.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.000
In this case, it's wild.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.200
In my experience, all anomalies and mysteries can be solved with rational, sensible answers.

16:38.000 --> 16:38.960
It could be magic.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.160
I slap you.

16:46.240 --> 16:51.200
He just kind of like, if you speak out of turn one more time on my task force.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.320
Or you'll do what?

16:52.320 --> 16:55.360
She looks at Elwood with her eyes like contain him.

16:55.360 --> 17:02.160
And then Elwood just puts a hand on like has to reach really high up to put a hand on Kevin's

17:02.160 --> 17:06.320
shoulder and he just does a light double squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.000
Mara Quinlan has had her back turned this entire time.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.240
When she saw the awkwardness happening, she immediately turned around and started fiddling

17:14.240 --> 17:15.680
with files on this desk.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.520
I mean, it seems like magic though, right?

17:19.520 --> 17:23.040
I mean, three witnesses the day after her time of death.

17:23.040 --> 17:28.960
I fully believe that that body is Eileen McCarty, but you know, three witnesses the day after

17:28.960 --> 17:30.800
time of death is strange for sure.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.880
Do you have any information about those witnesses?

17:32.880 --> 17:37.120
All I have is that there's three witnesses the day after time of death and the medical

17:37.120 --> 17:43.760
examiner also said it looks like the eyes were cut out with great care, which is odd.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.520
Three witnesses the day after the death.

17:46.240 --> 17:46.880
Yes.

17:46.880 --> 17:51.040
So this is in addition to the witnesses who saw her on the day of the gas station crimes.

17:51.040 --> 17:51.440
Yeah.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.160
Yeah, that's right.

17:52.160 --> 17:52.720
Yeah.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.080
They saw her in New York.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.920
The day after they saw her in New York.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.320
The day after her death, they saw her in New York.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.800
And then the next day was that the gas station.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.400
Yeah, she was seen at the gas station where that murder, that horrible, horrible murder

18:04.400 --> 18:05.280
took place.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.800
What do you think about that footage?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.040
She shudders.

18:09.840 --> 18:15.840
One of her hands begins to like grip the desk and her knuckles turn white.

18:16.880 --> 18:17.440
I don't know.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.040
Well, if it, if it helps at all in my role as a profiler criminal psychologist, you learn

18:23.040 --> 18:25.680
a lot about how regular people act too.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.920
Sometimes they just shut down with the fear and they can't, they can't think of doing

18:29.920 --> 18:30.640
the right thing.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.200
Oh yeah.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.760
She's just nodding her head and eating it up.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.160
Yeah.

18:34.160 --> 18:34.720
Yeah.

18:34.720 --> 18:34.960
Yeah.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.680
Of course.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.680
That's why we do the job we do.

18:37.680 --> 18:42.800
I like to think that I would have done something, but I, I understand wanting to not get involved.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.080
You signed up to do something.

18:44.080 --> 18:44.640
Exactly.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.520
That's, that's what your service to this community is.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.640
And my service is kind of at an end for you guys here.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.640
I've given you everything I have.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.400
If you have any questions for me, sure.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.000
But I do have these super high res crime scene photos.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.880
I know you probably saw uncle Jimmy.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.800
All of our copies of those are, well, disgusting.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.200
Yeah.

19:05.200 --> 19:05.520
Yeah.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.120
So I I've, I've got some on, on a thumb drive here if you want them.

19:09.120 --> 19:09.920
Thank you very much.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.800
I take the phone drive.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.120
Yeah.

19:11.120 --> 19:17.680
And maybe even after he handled Kevin dropping the magic like line, she like takes it, looks

19:17.680 --> 19:20.000
over at Elwood and then tosses it to him.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.080
Uh, Elwood catches it out of the air.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.280
It sticks to his hand.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.720
She instantly, she's like, no, now they're just covered in mayonnaise in another way.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.520
Holler if you need anything.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.480
Here's my card.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.040
All right.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.120
Thank you for your cooperation detective.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.160
We'll be in touch.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.040
Have a great day guys.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.400
And you as well.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.560
Hey, have you guys eaten since you've been out here?

19:43.280 --> 19:45.760
Yeah, we had some charcuterie.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.280
I had a bunch of olives.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.280
Elwood made me spit it out.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.560
Oh, I huh.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.560
Well, you know, you just keep, you have a good day now.

19:52.560 --> 19:52.800
Okay.

19:52.800 --> 19:52.960
Yeah.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.000
I regret asking.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.760
They didn't taste good.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.240
Okay.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.280
Why do you care?

19:57.280 --> 20:00.400
It's just, I had really good lunch, so I was going to suggest the place.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.040
Where did you go?

20:01.600 --> 20:02.880
Ocean city cafe.

20:02.880 --> 20:03.760
It's really good.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.720
It's just literally like around the corner from here.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.120
Pretty good.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.320
So if you need a bite to eat.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.840
Is it by the dripping scoop?

20:10.480 --> 20:13.520
Yeah, it's literally two doors down from the dripping scoop.

20:13.520 --> 20:13.760
Okay.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.080
I assume that was ice cream.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.360
I want ice cream.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.880
Oh no, that's not ice cream.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.400
Hey Zach, what is it?

20:27.040 --> 20:29.040
Where should we go almighty sparrow?

20:29.040 --> 20:34.160
You guys all say as you're looking out, uh, kind of standing at the double doors of this

20:34.160 --> 20:37.680
police station, looking out at the torrential downpour of rain.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.560
Now coming down here in ocean city, New Jersey.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.960
I get an umbrella out and hold it above Elwood.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.360
There's no acknowledgement from Elwood.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.240
It's just expected.

20:48.240 --> 20:48.480
Yeah.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.200
What was the name of the restaurant you told us to go to?

20:51.200 --> 20:56.000
Ocean city cafe, a real place in ocean city, New Jersey.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.200
That is like catty corner from the police station.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.040
I only, I only had olives.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.080
I will remind you.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.160
And I could use something else.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.640
I threw up my food and spit it out.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.600
I didn't need any of this food, but I pretended to eat an olive, which I just feel rotten about.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.760
Let's go where the lady told us to go.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.600
Yeah, let's stop by the ocean city cafe.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.400
Oh, that looks good.

21:18.400 --> 21:18.800
Right?

21:18.800 --> 21:19.120
Yeah.

21:19.120 --> 21:23.040
So I pulled up a picture of the ocean city cafe from Google street view.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.320
It's like an old house.

21:24.320 --> 21:24.720
It does.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.280
It looks like an old house, like an old three-story house.

21:27.280 --> 21:33.680
And there's a nice green awning on the outside that says ocean city cafe, breakfast, lunch,

21:33.680 --> 21:40.560
dinner, and there's some nice patio tables, like four or five tables outside with umbrellas.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.960
No one's sitting outside cause it's fucking coming down cats and dogs.

21:44.960 --> 21:50.640
And you guys rush in out of the rain into the ocean city cafe, which is a

21:51.600 --> 21:56.480
bustling little cafe here at about 1 32 o'clock PM.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.400
Hey, my name's Leah.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.360
I'll nope.

22:00.160 --> 22:00.560
Hello.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.440
My name's Leah.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.960
I'll be out in just a moment to help you.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.880
You can find anywhere to sit that you would like.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.480
Well, what happened with your voice just there?

22:09.040 --> 22:10.240
I decided to change it.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.840
Oh, are you like an actor?

22:11.840 --> 22:15.040
No, it's just, I studied journalism at the university.

22:15.040 --> 22:20.320
And so I was just, it's just, sometimes I like to put myself into other people's shoes for

22:20.320 --> 22:20.880
just a moment.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.240
Maybe, but her name tag says Leah Maloy.

22:24.240 --> 22:29.600
She's 20 female, curly, brown hair and long limbs.

22:29.600 --> 22:38.560
Shout out to crane song from Washington, DC, another $10 or up patron on patrion.com slash

22:38.560 --> 22:44.880
pretending pod and crane song is actually one of our $50 a month first church of contention

22:44.880 --> 22:46.400
youth group members.

22:47.040 --> 22:52.080
And so, uh, I, she's, uh, she's played in a couple of games that I've run now, a couple

22:52.080 --> 22:56.160
of Delta green games, uh, that I home brewed and, uh, an excellent player.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.880
So thank you crane song for Leah Maloy, who will sit you guys down.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.280
Okay.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.560
Hunts, what'll it be?

23:02.560 --> 23:07.920
Coffee, water, black coffee, a water toast, no butter toast, no butter.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.000
Uh, Elwood's going to order for Kevin.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.160
We'll take, uh, two chocolate milks, put some ice in them.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.040
Put some ice in those.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.040
We like it when it waters down, she shudders.

23:21.600 --> 23:27.280
Kevin's looking at a menu in front of him and I want the munchy platter and the Jersey

23:27.280 --> 23:27.780
burger.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.920
Oh, you already know what you want to eat.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.400
Okay, good.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.520
The munchy platter has chicken tenders, onion rings, French fries, mozzarella sticks, and

23:37.520 --> 23:39.040
Buffalo wings.

23:39.040 --> 23:39.520
Wow.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.080
Yeah.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.040
Make that, make that too.

23:41.040 --> 23:41.760
I don't need the burger.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.000
I'll just take the platter.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.400
Okay.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.920
Platter and the munchy.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.240
And did you want anything to eat on?

23:48.240 --> 23:48.560
Yes.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.440
Butter, no toast.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.000
That's right.

23:50.000 --> 23:50.640
So sorry.

23:50.640 --> 23:57.440
Uh, and she, uh, started writing down, she started writing the notes after she took the

23:57.440 --> 23:58.640
toast, no butter order.

23:58.640 --> 24:03.280
So she does write down butter, no toast, and then walks away and then immediately turns

24:03.280 --> 24:08.880
on her heels and it's like butter, no toast, no butter.

24:08.880 --> 24:14.960
And, uh, as an embarrassed server might do turns and, uh, wanting that good tip later

24:14.960 --> 24:16.400
is just like, no, no, no, my bad.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.520
And goes to the back.

24:18.960 --> 24:23.200
You're so fucked there because you can bring out both things separately, but you still

24:23.200 --> 24:26.000
brought out one thing you were not supposed to bring.

24:28.560 --> 24:33.120
She's just in the back staring at the sheet where she wrote down butter, no toast, and

24:33.120 --> 24:34.880
is just like, did I mean to do this?

24:34.880 --> 24:35.380
I do.

24:36.960 --> 24:44.480
But you know, uh, she is a lover of facts and therefore she comes back to the table

24:44.480 --> 24:49.920
a few minutes later with a coffee and two chocolate milks filled with the brim with

24:49.920 --> 24:51.120
ice cubes.

24:51.120 --> 24:54.080
Now I just wanted to do one more check on that butter, no toast.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.000
Was that butter, no toast or toast, no butter?

24:56.000 --> 24:56.960
What do you think?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.680
That's a, that's a very good, that's a very good point, ma'am.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.040
Sorry to bother you.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.480
And she walks back.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.160
Still not a hundred percent.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.760
She's definitely bringing you butter.

25:10.160 --> 25:14.000
Any, uh, any conversation happening over the, uh, coffee and chocolate milks?

25:14.000 --> 25:20.080
I think at least now agent Sparrow is like really deep in these crime scene photos.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.760
Oh, wait, we get, we didn't get copies of those.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.160
We got the, well, we didn't talk about, can I have a computer?

25:24.160 --> 25:26.080
Yeah, fuck yeah, you can have a computer.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.760
2016 baby.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.480
I'm pulling it up.

25:28.480 --> 25:32.000
I plugged in the, uh, the stick and we're looking at the high res images.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.600
Roll luck for me real quick.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.600
50 50 shots, 47.

25:37.600 --> 25:44.720
You plug it in correctly the first time that USB slides in there.

25:45.600 --> 25:50.080
Agent Sparrow, like her eyebrow raises that you're like, you really can get in and out of places.

25:52.320 --> 25:57.040
Actually, as you guys, it says here, you have to roll sanity again because these are high

25:57.040 --> 25:59.680
res crime scene photos.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.360
And so it says obscured by mayonnaise dance.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.000
That's right.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.800
So quote, there is nothing to be seen here except sand loss.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.080
We fell into your trap.

26:12.080 --> 26:12.320
Yeah.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.040
Not when you, not when you roll sick twelves.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.120
Oh, nice pass 32.

26:17.120 --> 26:17.760
I fail.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.160
Okay.

26:18.160 --> 26:22.080
So, uh, you are going to lose three sanity.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.440
Elwood Boyd loses three sanity.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.800
Are you okay, boss?

26:26.800 --> 26:31.680
He's probably shaking a little bit and he's now turned the computer screen away from himself

26:31.680 --> 26:35.200
so that you guys can see it, but he doesn't want it in his field of view at all.

26:35.200 --> 26:40.400
Agent Sparrow kind of like takes it from him and starts sort of very familiarly flipping

26:40.400 --> 26:42.080
through this file like system.

26:42.080 --> 26:45.680
She's been given reports like this before and she's just like tabbing through and she's

26:45.680 --> 26:46.720
like, yeah, okay.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.880
No eyes, no eyes.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.800
Carefully removed very carefully.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.120
So do you think the book is a clue?

26:53.280 --> 26:57.920
Shane seems to think that I want the listener to know that every single time Joe goes into

26:57.920 --> 27:03.040
character, he holds his wrists limp and then one over the other.

27:03.040 --> 27:03.920
We'll post a picture.

27:03.920 --> 27:04.160
Yeah.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.560
Like he goes a little Igor.

27:07.360 --> 27:07.600
Yeah.

27:09.280 --> 27:09.520
Yeah.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.680
That's the sort of the picture of my brain.

27:11.680 --> 27:18.880
It's Igor, the creature, which is actually what you just lost sanity to was some Igor.

27:23.200 --> 27:27.120
Hey, I like that one.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.360
That's both electronic.

27:32.320 --> 27:36.000
And the thing we just said in all the blood.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.560
You're right.

27:36.560 --> 27:37.840
That's why it was a joke, Joe.

27:40.560 --> 27:45.040
Sometimes you would just let it sit with the gore, but you worked in that E.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.080
The E was important.

27:46.480 --> 27:54.880
It's could I give you a forensics or medicine or even alertness or search role on these

27:54.880 --> 27:59.360
pictures to determine what just to see if I can glean anything more from them?

27:59.360 --> 28:02.720
Yeah, go ahead and give me a forensics.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.760
What about a medicine?

28:03.760 --> 28:04.320
Oh, okay.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.120
Whichever.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.880
It'll get you something different.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.600
I suppose.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.240
Okay.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.920
46 on a 60 medicine.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.320
Okay.

28:14.320 --> 28:18.480
So with a 46 on a 60 medicine, you're really diving in.

28:18.480 --> 28:24.480
And I will say, even though the great Dennis Detwiller wrote, there's nothing to be seen

28:24.480 --> 28:28.880
here except sand loss, especially because you passed that sanity check.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.920
Oh yeah, you did just say that.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.960
You can dive in.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.920
Yeah, I did.

28:31.920 --> 28:41.040
But you dive in and you can very clearly pull up a picture of Eileen and it's definitely

28:41.040 --> 28:41.680
Eileen.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.040
You can match it up enough to where like the corpse.

28:45.040 --> 28:53.760
Yeah, anyone who thinks that this is not Eileen is really grasping at straws to make a case

28:53.760 --> 28:54.400
that they want.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.480
Now I think I know what's going on as Thomas, but Agent Sparrow doesn't.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.320
Agent Sparrow definitely would because she doesn't know the scenario is called control

29:02.320 --> 29:09.280
copy or that this podcast is called pretending to be people and like that's part.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.280
Yeah, you're right.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.400
She doesn't know those things.

29:14.400 --> 29:14.960
She does.

29:14.960 --> 29:20.000
She does like take a note of the fact that this is certainly Eileen's corpse unless she

29:20.000 --> 29:22.160
has a twin with both her eyes.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.640
These witnesses were sorely mistaken.

29:24.640 --> 29:29.280
What about a magic that makes you look like her?

29:29.280 --> 29:30.640
Oh, I'm glad you brought that up.

29:30.640 --> 29:37.280
Hey, now I know you've been on a couple of nights at the opera before with Elwood.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.320
Yeah, yeah.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.880
Y'all are just friendlies right now, right?

29:42.880 --> 29:43.520
Is that what they call you?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.760
We're friends with each other for a long time.

29:47.840 --> 29:48.480
Right, right.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.160
Elwood, you're friendlies?

29:50.720 --> 29:52.880
No, we're full-fledged these days.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.320
We've done a couple of these now.

29:54.320 --> 29:59.200
All right, well, that concerns me because this one doesn't seem to know you can't be

29:59.200 --> 30:00.640
talking to civilians.

30:00.640 --> 30:05.360
Well, you know, it's a police officer, but you can't be talking to the uninitiated about

30:05.360 --> 30:07.600
the supernatural and the otherworldly.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.280
You're right, bud.

30:09.280 --> 30:13.280
That is probably magic, but we can't be saying that to detectives from Newark.

30:13.280 --> 30:13.920
Do you know what I mean?

30:15.920 --> 30:17.280
Can you guys roll alertness for me?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.360
I'm gonna roll intelligence to see if I know what he means.

30:23.120 --> 30:27.440
Okay, I passed alertness and I passed my intelligence check.

30:28.000 --> 30:34.160
Leah Molloy failed her stealth roll and she is trying to eavesdrop.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.320
I also passed my alertness.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.200
So you guys were able to have this conversation covertly.

30:39.200 --> 30:45.040
As you notice, she is literally trying to bust the tables closest to you as she kind

30:45.040 --> 30:47.680
of gets a hint that you're talking secrets.

30:47.680 --> 30:54.640
Yeah, so agent Sparrow tilts the laptop away from her from a view in towards the booth.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.480
And she says, let me go grab your food.

30:56.480 --> 31:02.960
And she comes back with both things that Kevin ordered, one of which also goes to Elwood

31:03.520 --> 31:08.480
and then she sets down a plate very, very awkwardly.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.760
She slowly sits down a plate of butter.

31:12.320 --> 31:15.520
Agent Sparrow is already just like looking back in her notes.

31:15.520 --> 31:20.720
And you can tell she's really deep and lot like she got she's on a trail and she just

31:20.720 --> 31:25.120
kind of absentmindedly like spoons butter into her mouth.

31:25.120 --> 31:30.720
And like it looks she makes an unpleasant face, but doesn't, you know, spit it out or

31:31.600 --> 31:33.520
really clock that that's what she's just done.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.600
The other two you see Leah Molloy is like, oh, nailed it.

31:40.000 --> 31:40.560
Nailed it.

31:40.560 --> 31:45.520
And then she says, did you guys hear about the new vandalism in town?

31:45.520 --> 31:45.920
What?

31:45.920 --> 31:49.600
Yeah, it's this weird like pentagram ish kind of thing.

31:49.600 --> 31:54.320
It's this dark brown paint that someone's using to make these tags.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.960
It looks like it's so scary.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.080
Can you guys handle this?

31:58.080 --> 31:59.280
It's super scary.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.240
Dark brown.

32:00.240 --> 32:00.800
Yeah, yeah.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.280
Agent Sparrow's like stomach sinks.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.880
Kevin is like intently listening, but he hands her his two empty plates.

32:10.240 --> 32:16.400
And she kind of like holds him on her forearm like a server might as she's like, yeah, this

32:16.400 --> 32:16.720
thing.

32:16.720 --> 32:22.640
It's kind of pentagram ish, but it looks like a bearskin rug.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.440
You know what I mean?

32:23.440 --> 32:28.080
Like the head, then the paws, then the feet, you know, that would make kind of a star pattern

32:28.160 --> 32:30.480
like a pentagram, but it's not a bear.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.000
It's like a person.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.440
It's like the picture of it's like a person who's like splayed out.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.240
It's like a person skin rug.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.960
Yeah, but that's it's just that it's art all over.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.000
It's crazy looking and dark brown paint.

32:44.000 --> 32:44.320
Yeah.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.080
Is it like the rotruvian man?

32:46.080 --> 32:47.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:47.040 --> 32:51.440
Like Leonardo DiCaprio, but but skinned, right?

32:51.440 --> 32:51.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.080
Like skinned and pinned by the stiff.

32:56.080 --> 33:01.920
Oh, actually, so that jogs something in Agent Sparrow's mind and she's like, I'm hungry

33:01.920 --> 33:02.480
then I thought.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.440
And she points to the menu.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.600
She says, I will take the skinned and pinned.

33:10.320 --> 33:16.240
You said is have you seen that that symbol that's been other there many places?

33:16.240 --> 33:22.080
I hear like everything that goes on in Ocean City because I don't know if you could tell

33:22.080 --> 33:22.880
earlier.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.680
I think you could tell.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.200
I was trying to listen to you guys too.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.800
But I just I love it trying to get the scoop trying to get the scoop.

33:30.800 --> 33:35.360
You know, I dropped out, but I'm going to get that big break and I'm going to write

33:35.360 --> 33:38.400
the story that puts my name on the map.

33:38.400 --> 33:38.880
Do you know?

33:39.440 --> 33:43.280
Well, Miss Malloy, if you want to make a difference in this world, I suggest getting your law

33:43.280 --> 33:46.320
degree and going into some kind of criminal enforcement.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.320
That's the only way I really see to make a difference.

33:48.320 --> 33:53.280
But because that's what we did do, it's our job to scoop around, figure that out.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.880
That's not that's not yours.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.880
And do you have any pie?

33:56.880 --> 33:57.120
Yeah.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.640
Why don't you butt out and get us some pie?

33:59.600 --> 34:01.840
And one spin and pinned extra crispy.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.440
Completely turned off by this situation.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.920
She's not going to try to make any more chitchat with you guys.

34:07.920 --> 34:12.480
She's just going to bring you the food and the pie and then you can head out as you guys

34:12.480 --> 34:13.920
are finishing up the pie.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.440
Blueberry.

34:18.960 --> 34:23.680
Miss Malloy, do you know the location of any of those recent graffitis?

34:23.680 --> 34:26.320
Yeah, there's one literally right around the corner.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.560
It's on the Ocean City Cafe.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.360
Thank you very much.

34:30.080 --> 34:34.320
Agent Sparrow leaves a not great, but sensible and not insulting tip.

34:34.880 --> 34:35.360
What is that?

34:35.360 --> 34:36.560
What percentage is that?

34:36.560 --> 34:37.840
It's probably like 17.

34:37.840 --> 34:42.800
As he's scooting out of the booth, Elwood grabs a fork near him and he finishes off

34:42.800 --> 34:44.480
whatever is left of the pad of butter.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.560
Do I see that?

34:49.920 --> 34:50.240
Sure.

34:53.920 --> 34:58.320
Yeah, Elwood, for the rest of the game, is going to have like grease marks around his

34:58.320 --> 35:02.400
mouth from doubling down this plate and then butter also.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.360
Jesus.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.400
It's horrible.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.520
When we get around to the graffiti, Kevin's going to start doing some push-ups.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.400
Okay, I'm going to go pee real quick.

35:12.400 --> 35:24.000
Until I had an alien abortion.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.520
Alien abortion.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.960
Alien abortion.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.480
Alien abortion.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.680
Alien abortion.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.680
Get this beast out of my belly.

35:33.840 --> 35:38.400
Kevin Gelato begins doing push-ups.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.920
How does Kevin do push-ups?

35:45.920 --> 35:47.360
Look at Clarissa.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.880
It's how he keeps in shape.

35:48.880 --> 35:54.240
Yeah, and she's tapped you and she's like, I think it's good that he's distracted for

35:54.240 --> 35:54.560
a minute.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.320
Can we talk for a second?

35:57.440 --> 35:58.000
Sure.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.920
So like, you help him out?

35:59.920 --> 36:02.000
What's the nature of your...

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I mean, we help each other out, surely.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.080
I guess you could say he's my bodyguard.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.320
That's kind of the way I like to think of him.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.120
Your bodyguard.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.160
Yeah, I mean, look at me.

36:12.160 --> 36:16.000
I wouldn't do anything in a fight and I do run my mouth from time to time and I feel

36:16.000 --> 36:18.320
like I should have some muscle there.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.320
He's always been by my side.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.080
I keep him around.

36:22.080 --> 36:22.400
All right.

36:23.200 --> 36:23.760
Yeah.

36:23.760 --> 36:24.880
Would you say you're friends?

36:26.080 --> 36:26.720
He would.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.220
Yeah.

36:29.120 --> 36:35.440
So yeah, Clarissa just allows that to be added to like how sad the world is.

36:35.440 --> 36:39.520
She's just like, can't.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.240
All right.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.320
Can't think about that necessarily right now.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.880
Yeah, you look down at the ground to get away from that thought.

36:44.880 --> 36:48.400
Well, I look down at the ground and see him doing the pushups and then I look back up

36:48.400 --> 36:51.600
and he's like, there's one more thing I wanted to say.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.120
You know, when that waitress mentioned the dark brown paint.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.760
I saw your eyes kind of sunk a little.

36:58.640 --> 36:59.280
Well, I just...

37:00.320 --> 37:02.720
Do you know what gets dark brown when it dries?

37:03.520 --> 37:08.560
He's just seen the crime scene photos and it sparks in his mind a little bit.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.320
Oh, oh.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.520
Yeah, that's blood.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.680
I'm going to go take a look at this graffiti.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.960
Could you keep him here doing pushups?

37:18.960 --> 37:21.680
Do you think you could handle the side of that if you knew what it was?

37:22.400 --> 37:24.720
I think Elwood would think that he could handle it.

37:24.720 --> 37:28.240
Like he clocked that guy in the back of the head in my pre-story.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.640
Yeah, like I don't think he's immune to violence.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.920
Oh, I thought he jacked him off so well that he passed out.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.760
You said he whacked him real good.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.920
He whacked him so good, dude.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.440
He said he's in his boxers on the floor.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.320
Whacked him so good that he's down for five hours.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.120
Western style.

37:45.120 --> 37:49.680
If it was a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he would handle it, but it's blood.

37:49.680 --> 37:50.180
I don't know.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.520
That's what I'm thinking.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.800
If it's a big crusty cum stain on the wall, he could handle it.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.000
This is blood.

37:56.880 --> 38:01.440
Oh, I think I just spoke.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.640
He didn't whack him.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.040
Whack him.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.400
He whacked him.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.080
And at this time you hear Kevin go,

38:06.720 --> 38:08.080
and a punch.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.920
And then he just gets up and walks over.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.920
And a bunch.

38:20.960 --> 38:25.360
Kevin, can you stomach the side of blood?

38:25.360 --> 38:27.040
I made people bleed.

38:27.040 --> 38:27.600
He has.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.320
Yeah, he has.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.400
On and off the field.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.440
She takes a note of that as well and doesn't say anything.

38:33.440 --> 38:38.080
She's like, all right, let's go investigate this graffiti.

38:38.080 --> 38:38.320
Yeah.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.480
Also, I don't even know what kind of EQ I'm going to have to use on Luke's voice for this

38:43.040 --> 38:46.400
group of episodes to get that voice.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.000
It's not that you're speaking quietly.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.640
It's just that I fully had to parse it for a second in my language center.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.920
It was like a Spanish person listening to Portuguese.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.920
Like, oh no, we can make each other self understood,

39:01.920 --> 39:04.480
but I'm not going to be fluently communicating with you.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.760
So you guys turned the corner, just right around the corner of this restaurant.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.560
And basically, if you were driving on the street,

39:14.560 --> 39:17.360
you would be able to see this vandalism.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.880
This, we can say it's blood, probably.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.080
Blood graffiti.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.120
Probably blood graffiti.

39:23.920 --> 39:28.400
Justin hits some sweet, like, string rises here.

39:28.400 --> 39:28.880
Oh yeah.

39:28.880 --> 39:36.080
It's as Agent Sparrow, like, shakily walks up to the wall and does a medicine roll to examine it.

39:36.080 --> 39:36.580
Yeah.

39:40.320 --> 39:40.960
69.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.260
Nice.

39:44.960 --> 39:45.460
Whoa.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.380
Okay.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.000
69.

39:50.880 --> 39:51.380
Hmm.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.200
I know the blood type.

39:53.200 --> 39:53.600
Who's blood this is.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.800
He knows who's blood it is.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.480
I was trying to think of a way that I could tell you who's blood it is.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.320
They wrote the name above here.

40:02.320 --> 40:02.820
Right.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.240
69.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.800
Kevin just ordered dinner for two.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.920
And you guys are...

40:07.920 --> 40:09.360
Is there any cool meaning I might be...

40:09.360 --> 40:11.120
Like, I was trying to see if it was blood,

40:11.120 --> 40:14.880
but do I grasp maybe the significance of this picture?

40:14.880 --> 40:15.040
Yeah.

40:15.040 --> 40:19.840
With the 69, I will tell you that that is an occult symbol.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.720
It is related to the Testament of New Flesh.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.840
Is that, like, even something I might have heard of before?

40:27.840 --> 40:28.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.800
That's why you recognize it, is you're like,

40:30.800 --> 40:36.000
shit, this is the Testament of New Flesh,

40:36.000 --> 40:41.440
which is this, like, old idea that there were these chants

40:42.080 --> 40:46.640
that people could learn in this language called Aklo,

40:46.640 --> 40:51.120
which is a pre-human language that people talk about,

40:51.120 --> 40:54.320
like, it's this thing, like, within the walls of Delta Green,

40:54.320 --> 40:56.720
you know, people might be talking about Aklo,

40:56.720 --> 41:01.360
some very, like, estranged professors who are not well respected

41:01.360 --> 41:03.520
at their specific universities, you know.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.280
These are the kind of people who talk about Testament of the New Flesh.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.840
It's cult worship of some sort of unknown deity.

41:11.840 --> 41:12.480
Yeah, yeah.

41:13.280 --> 41:18.880
I knew a man, he was almost like a father to me,

41:20.400 --> 41:25.600
but he died on my first mission with this organization,

41:26.400 --> 41:27.920
but he spoke of things like this.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.720
He was interested in this group, he called it the Testament of New Flesh,

41:34.080 --> 41:35.920
and this is one of, it was crude,

41:35.920 --> 41:38.480
he didn't have a good drawing of it, but he showed me this symbol.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.120
Agent Sparrow, your phone starts ringing.

41:41.920 --> 41:42.480
Unknown number.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.520
No, it doesn't say unknown, it has numbers there.

41:45.520 --> 41:46.480
It's 2016.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.360
It's 2016.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.480
I already don't want to answer phone calls that I get

41:50.480 --> 41:52.400
when I don't know the number at this point in time,

41:52.400 --> 41:56.240
but this is my work phone, so I do.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.120
Yeah, hello.

42:00.160 --> 42:03.760
Agent, Agent, Agent, uh, Sparrow, right?

42:03.760 --> 42:04.960
Mr. DeChase.

42:05.760 --> 42:09.520
DeShane, yes, I, I am so scared.

42:10.400 --> 42:14.960
I just got, I got a voicemail, I got a voicemail from Chilton.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.680
It says I'm next, he's gonna kill me.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.280
He's gonna kill me.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.600
You hold on tight, we'll be right there.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.480
Thank you.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.360
He hangs up.

42:23.360 --> 42:26.640
Elwood, you call 911, you tell them to get RAT to his address,

42:26.640 --> 42:28.800
and then I directly call the detective.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.640
Elwood, Elwood's gonna pop in real quick.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.360
What's going on?

42:33.360 --> 42:35.680
Mr. DeChase just got a message.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.120
He says it's from Chilton.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.120
He says Chilton threatened him next.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.800
We gotta get there immediately,

42:40.800 --> 42:42.880
and I think we need all the help we can get.

42:44.240 --> 42:47.760
I worry that we should keep this in-house for the time being.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.920
What if he shows up and does our kind of thing?

42:51.920 --> 42:54.640
But what if he shows up and the cops are already there and he doesn't?

42:54.640 --> 42:55.840
We could save this man's life.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.680
From my experience, that's not exactly what we're hired to do.

43:00.560 --> 43:06.400
We're supposed to keep the unnatural threat from civilian eyes.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.560
Well, she's gonna try to persuade you.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.120
We know this unnatural threat is after his civilian eyes.

43:16.640 --> 43:17.920
They dig out the eyeballs.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.800
You can give me a big disadvantage on that.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.080
That's not a good argument, but it's a funny argument.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.000
How do you combat a persuade?

43:28.640 --> 43:31.520
Humant, or you can role persuade yourself.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.360
They're the same!

43:35.120 --> 43:35.600
Forty.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.160
Fifty.

43:36.160 --> 43:36.560
Fifty!

43:39.280 --> 43:40.240
Big ol' fail.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.040
She fails too.

43:41.040 --> 43:41.840
Who failed higher?

43:41.840 --> 43:42.800
Mine's a ninety-eight.

43:42.800 --> 43:43.920
Oh, Jesus.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.800
Mine's an eighty-two.

43:44.800 --> 43:45.360
That'll do it.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.120
So you're not convinced, but you're...

43:47.120 --> 43:47.600
Play ball.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.120
You don't feel confident enough maybe to say no to her in this situation.

43:51.120 --> 43:51.760
I like that.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.080
There's a pause, and you were looking at each other,

43:54.080 --> 43:55.760
and she can just see you don't buy it.

43:56.400 --> 44:00.320
I have my reasons to believe that he could be important to this case,

44:00.320 --> 44:03.680
and you don't buy that either, but you can tell that she's gonna go try to save him.

44:03.680 --> 44:04.240
Sure.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.520
Elwood does reluctantly call local PD.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.000
Yeah.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.520
You were calling the detective?

44:09.520 --> 44:13.280
I was gonna call the detective, but I was hoping you could call actual dispatch

44:13.280 --> 44:16.240
and just start the process of getting, you know, cop cars.

44:16.240 --> 44:16.720
Sure.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.760
While I'm gonna specifically call some of these, like, people.

44:19.760 --> 44:20.800
The players.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.040
Yeah.

44:21.040 --> 44:21.280
Yeah.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.160
Elwood is doing that on the phone.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.040
He says, hey, it's Agent Boyd,

44:27.040 --> 44:31.680
and we have reason to believe that the landlord Duchesne life is in jeopardy

44:31.680 --> 44:32.240
or something like that.

44:32.240 --> 44:32.880
Absolutely.

44:32.880 --> 44:37.120
And when Agent Sparrow calls in to the department and talks to Quinlan,

44:37.120 --> 44:39.520
she can talk to Garza as well either way.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.640
I don't talk to Garza.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.000
Oh, you don't like Uncle Jimmy?

44:43.920 --> 44:45.600
I do not care for Agent Garza.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.240
Yeah.

44:46.240 --> 44:49.680
Quinlan will tell you that when you tell her what happened,

44:49.680 --> 44:51.680
she says, let me check the phone records.

44:51.680 --> 44:52.400
They got a ping.

44:52.400 --> 44:57.680
And yeah, they got a ping that Arvin Chilton's phone called Alexander Duchesne's phone.

44:57.680 --> 44:58.400
Cool.

44:58.400 --> 45:02.960
Detective Quinlan, I need you to gather anyone you have here with you from Newark,

45:03.600 --> 45:05.200
any of your associates.

45:05.200 --> 45:06.640
We haven't met Gambeson yet.

45:06.640 --> 45:07.920
Please get them involved.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.760
You can tell Agent Garza or not.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.440
Gambeson is out still.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.240
He must have taken a long lunch or got caught up doing something,

45:14.240 --> 45:15.920
but he'll be back later.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.400
Can they see where that phone call was from?

45:18.400 --> 45:19.120
Gia, look at it.

45:19.120 --> 45:19.840
Ping it?

45:19.840 --> 45:20.340
Yeah.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.240
Put it in a triangle.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.720
It was in Ocean City, we can say.

45:24.720 --> 45:28.320
You said put it in a triangle.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.680
You mean triangulated, yeah.

45:30.240 --> 45:32.080
Have they been able to triangulate the signal?

45:32.080 --> 45:33.120
Like on Netflix.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.480
Put it in a triangle is a pretty good way to describe it.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.640
Put it in a triangle.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.880
The call's coming from inside the town.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.160
We've got to hurry.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.040
When you arrive in our jaguar.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.160
And you're fucked up.

45:50.160 --> 45:50.640
What?

45:50.640 --> 45:51.920
Our jaguar.

45:51.920 --> 45:52.880
In our jaguar.

45:57.440 --> 45:58.080
What is that?

45:58.080 --> 46:02.320
Solve Delta Green and kill scary monsters.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.280
And get there in the back of our jaguar.

46:06.320 --> 46:06.640
Cool.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.760
You guys all know the thing.

46:07.760 --> 46:08.400
Dragula?

46:09.760 --> 46:10.160
You would know.

46:10.160 --> 46:10.720
I think you would know.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.080
You don't know that song?

46:12.080 --> 46:18.400
Burn through the riches and burn with the riches and burn in the back of my dragula.

46:19.520 --> 46:20.640
No, it was fun though.

46:20.640 --> 46:21.360
I like it.

46:21.360 --> 46:21.760
Wow.

46:21.760 --> 46:22.880
We'll play it for you later.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.200
Okay.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.760
It's like one of the opening parts of the matrix.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.440
They're all dancing in a club to that song.

46:27.440 --> 46:28.320
Oh, for real?

46:28.320 --> 46:28.640
Really?

46:28.640 --> 46:30.480
I haven't seen the matrix in a long ass time.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.120
Yep.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.120
That's such a, that's so bizarre.

46:35.440 --> 46:39.120
I kind of, I mean like that's, I could see like a goth dance club.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.000
That's kind of what it is.

46:40.000 --> 46:40.800
Like the late nineties.

46:40.800 --> 46:43.520
It's like industrial enough that that song can hit the masses.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.440
Oh, it's where he goes down the rabbit hole.

46:45.440 --> 46:45.680
Yeah.

46:45.680 --> 46:46.640
Follows the white rat.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.920
Yeah, he follows the rabbit.

46:47.920 --> 46:48.400
Gotcha.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.560
We arrive there in our jaguar.

46:50.560 --> 46:51.280
That's right.

46:51.280 --> 46:54.720
And there are four squad cars already on the scene.

46:55.360 --> 47:00.640
There are some police officers in uniform standing around their cars, just kind of like

47:00.640 --> 47:01.840
talking to each other.

47:01.840 --> 47:07.120
You see that the door is open and there are a couple officers already speaking to Mr.

47:07.120 --> 47:12.480
Duchesne who waves his hands at the three of you when he sees you arrive.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.800
Kevin waves back at him in Kevin's mind.

47:14.800 --> 47:19.680
He's like trying to put on the FBI character and he gets out of the car and goes up.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.360
So what's going on boys?

47:21.360 --> 47:23.200
Oh, you're a big fella, aren't you?

47:23.200 --> 47:23.440
Hey.

47:25.840 --> 47:26.320
Uh-huh.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.400
Big guy.

47:28.400 --> 47:29.120
Uh-huh.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.960
Big guy in the FBI.

47:30.960 --> 47:35.200
The look on Kevin's face goes to a little bit of confusion and almost like, are they

47:35.200 --> 47:36.000
making fun of me?

47:36.800 --> 47:39.840
Yeah, for sure we are.

47:41.840 --> 47:42.560
What?

47:42.560 --> 47:44.080
I'm an FBI.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.280
Are you walking into the house?

47:45.280 --> 47:48.640
Yeah, she doesn't see this because she is like beelining for the door.

47:48.640 --> 47:52.400
I think Elwood would be kind of shuffling behind her and when he gets toward Kevin,

47:52.400 --> 47:54.160
he just kind of pulls him along with him.

47:54.160 --> 47:58.000
Yeah, Kevin like picks up the front of one of the cruisers and kind of shoves it.

47:59.440 --> 48:03.200
Yeah, just like and like gives them a dirty look.

48:03.200 --> 48:03.760
Oh my God.

48:03.760 --> 48:05.920
They're both like freaking out and you walk away.

48:05.920 --> 48:09.760
But when you turn back and look, one of them's on the other one's shoulders and they're

48:09.760 --> 48:11.520
like, where'd that guy?

48:13.120 --> 48:13.760
Oh man.

48:15.440 --> 48:15.680
Wow.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.200
Hey Kev.

48:19.440 --> 48:20.080
These Kev.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.800
These cops are bastards for sure.

48:24.640 --> 48:24.960
All right.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.640
And so you guys go...

48:27.840 --> 48:31.360
What about, you know, humble public servants like John Lee Pettymore?

48:32.960 --> 48:34.640
Who never did a thing wrong in his life.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.720
Never did a thing wrong.

48:36.720 --> 48:39.120
Diligent public employees like Keith Vigna.

48:39.120 --> 48:43.520
You can go honestly wave off these officers who are currently talking to Duchenne because

48:43.520 --> 48:46.480
he clearly wants to talk to you as opposed to them.

48:46.480 --> 48:50.160
I need to speak with Mr. Duchenne alone for a moment, but can you brief me on what you

48:50.160 --> 48:52.160
found here in the time you've been on the scene?

48:52.160 --> 48:54.400
He leans in real close.

48:55.120 --> 49:00.560
I've been holding my nose the whole time without holding it with my hand because he

49:00.560 --> 49:02.160
spells really bad.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.280
Like this apartment spells horrible and so does he.

49:05.280 --> 49:08.160
Did you determine anything about the nature of the threat?

49:08.160 --> 49:09.840
Oh, I listened to the voicemail.

49:09.840 --> 49:10.880
Do you want to hear it?

49:10.880 --> 49:11.600
Yes, please.

49:11.600 --> 49:16.880
Okay, so he'll pull up Duchenne's phone and plays you a voicemail and you just hear...

49:23.600 --> 49:26.000
Clearly in the voice of Arvin Chilton.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.120
We just established it.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.600
Arvin Chilton and I'm possessed by dark mysteries.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.080
I love Shakespeare.

49:50.560 --> 49:54.480
Yeah, that's a really unsettling voicemail to hear.

49:56.480 --> 49:57.440
I'm not changing it.

49:57.440 --> 49:58.480
That is the voicemail.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.160
Oh wow, I'm gonna kill you.

50:01.440 --> 50:04.240
So chipper and casual about that threat.

50:04.240 --> 50:06.160
I would be alarmed too, Mr. Duchenne.

50:06.160 --> 50:06.660
I just...

50:10.000 --> 50:13.200
He wouldn't do it, I don't think, but that's him.

50:13.920 --> 50:15.120
That's his voice.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.040
That's his voice and they sang it.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.080
It sounds like, yeah, he said point blank that he was going to do it.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.440
I think he's gonna do it.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.560
Did you make him mad?

50:23.600 --> 50:25.200
I didn't do anything.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.000
But what did you...

50:26.000 --> 50:27.520
You gotta do something.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.240
I didn't.

50:28.240 --> 50:31.120
Were you maybe supposed to get his book back to him a little sooner than you did?

50:33.200 --> 50:35.360
Yes, maybe.

50:36.480 --> 50:37.360
I don't know.

50:37.360 --> 50:38.480
I doubt that's likely.

50:38.480 --> 50:42.480
You said he was giving it to you one to two days before he disappeared?

50:42.480 --> 50:43.040
That's right.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.920
That would be a very short amount of time to expect a book back.

50:45.920 --> 50:48.000
Also, I don't think it's worth murder.

50:48.720 --> 50:49.220
Do you?

50:50.560 --> 50:53.600
As a criminal profiler, I have to tell you that

50:53.600 --> 50:58.800
what murderers consider worth murder is not what you and I would expect.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.920
Damn dude, that's intense, Agent Sparrow.

51:01.920 --> 51:05.760
Your life is in danger, but these officers are going to be here with you all night.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.240
How come you let it go for your voicemail?

51:08.240 --> 51:09.840
I couldn't hear my phone.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.560
It was on vibrate and I couldn't hear it.

51:12.560 --> 51:16.720
So for the first time, Agent Sparrow is gonna call Agent Garza.

51:16.720 --> 51:17.120
Okay.

51:17.120 --> 51:21.280
And basically she's just gonna relay that if you can coordinate with the local cops

51:21.280 --> 51:25.520
to give him round-the-clock protection for at least the next few days while we're in town.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.800
Okay, sounds good.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.400
Did you try calling him back?

51:28.400 --> 51:29.120
Well, you...

51:29.120 --> 51:30.000
Hey, big guy.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.520
Well, you stay with me.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.120
These guys, they got guns.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.240
They got whatever.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.200
They're cops, you know.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.480
They have guns, but you, you're a big guy.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.480
I think you could definitely protect me.

51:42.480 --> 51:43.680
Kevin looks at Elwood.

51:43.680 --> 51:45.600
Elwood kind of steps between them.

51:45.600 --> 51:46.800
No, he's mine.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.240
I know what he says.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.880
Agent Sparrow's on the phone, but that gets an eyebrow raise from her.

51:50.880 --> 51:51.380
Uh-huh.

51:51.920 --> 51:53.760
Okay, well, could both of you stay?

51:53.760 --> 51:57.600
You could both stay upstairs or you could stay in here anywhere, please.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.440
I just feel so scared.

51:59.440 --> 52:00.720
What time is it?

52:00.720 --> 52:02.000
It's getting later now.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.240
It's probably five, five thirty.

52:04.240 --> 52:08.000
I think internally Elwood also would think, but it's not the worst idea.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.720
It'd be like staking out the place all night.

52:10.720 --> 52:11.600
Yeah, so she does.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.880
She pulls you aside.

52:12.880 --> 52:15.280
She's like, yeah, that was, that was my thinking as well.

52:15.280 --> 52:18.800
And we've seen what whatever's out there can do to people.

52:18.800 --> 52:22.160
It wouldn't be such a bad idea to have the big fella around.

52:22.160 --> 52:26.000
Now, let's let him get some sleep, the big fella.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.040
You take first watch.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.760
I'm going to start reading as you like it.

52:31.520 --> 52:33.760
Actually, I mean, I guess the cops are keeping watch.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.600
We've still got the uniform police here.

52:35.600 --> 52:39.520
Why don't we encourage Kevin to take a little nap, sleep off those burgers.

52:40.080 --> 52:42.080
I've got his copy of as you like it.

52:42.080 --> 52:46.640
I've just sent you a link to a free digital open source copy of as you like it.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.720
Why don't you read along and we can see if we can.

52:49.840 --> 52:54.160
You seem intelligent, even though you are very shifty and quite mean to your friend.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.440
I'll read it again if you think I need to, but I have read it.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.000
It's, it's a thrilling tale.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.360
Since you're already so familiar with the text, I would just, I'd love it.

53:03.360 --> 53:08.160
If you read it again with me and I will be looking for maybe some overarching themes,

53:08.160 --> 53:12.640
but perhaps with your familiarity with the text, you could pick out some details that

53:12.640 --> 53:14.640
that might might've missed that might be relevant.

53:14.640 --> 53:17.600
As they're having this conversation, I'm over with Chilton still.

53:18.560 --> 53:19.520
You're with Chilton?

53:20.400 --> 53:20.880
He's here.

53:21.680 --> 53:22.080
He's here.

53:25.040 --> 53:27.200
I am with Duchenne.

53:27.200 --> 53:27.600
We did it.

53:29.600 --> 53:30.880
The Eastern Seaboard is safe.

53:30.880 --> 53:36.160
Uh, I'm as they're talking, as they're talking, I'm over with Duchenne.

53:36.160 --> 53:36.560
Yeah.

53:36.560 --> 53:38.880
Did you call him back and ask him why?

53:38.880 --> 53:44.480
No, I, as soon as I heard it, I, I call, he points at agent Sparrow.

53:44.480 --> 53:46.880
He's like, I called agent Sparrow.

53:46.880 --> 53:52.560
Call him back and see where he is and ask him why.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.840
Agent Sparrow looks at you with like genuine shock on our eyes.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.800
Yeah, that is a pretty good, yeah.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.560
We'd like to, everybody, everybody quiet down.

54:02.560 --> 54:03.440
Everybody quiet down.

54:04.080 --> 54:08.480
Mr. Duchenne, please, please redial that number.

54:10.560 --> 54:12.240
His finger shakes.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.320
Zach's rolling to see if his finger falls off.

54:16.320 --> 54:20.720
Wobbling as it goes to punch in the number.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.840
It's a rotary of Arvin Chilton.

54:23.840 --> 54:27.600
He's going to roll for each number dial because he might miss click at any moment.

54:27.600 --> 54:28.100
Yep.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.240
First number is good.

54:31.280 --> 54:31.920
Second number.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.120
Oh, got it wrong.

54:34.560 --> 54:40.080
Until Zach rolls heads seven times in a row, he's going to be getting one number wrong.

54:40.080 --> 54:43.600
And we just got to sit here and play that out because sometimes that's what we're playing.

54:46.560 --> 54:47.360
Let me try again.

54:49.920 --> 54:50.640
Please.

54:50.640 --> 54:56.400
And he finally just goes to calls recent and then clicks on the name Arvin Chilton.

54:57.600 --> 55:04.160
And agent Sparrow, Kevin Gelato, Elwood Boyd, as well as these two police officers

55:04.160 --> 55:07.600
and Alexander Duchenne all here.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.480
Coming from the upstairs apartment.

55:19.280 --> 55:21.600
Oh, it's coming from the who's.

55:24.240 --> 55:24.800
Oh no.

55:27.600 --> 55:43.040
Kevin looks at Elwood and looks at Clarissa and is like, not sure why they have these

55:43.040 --> 55:46.720
expressions on their face, but he matches their expression quickly.

55:57.600 --> 56:07.520
And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind, I'll be all

56:07.520 --> 56:08.320
right.

56:08.320 --> 56:14.400
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.480
I'll be all right.

56:16.480 --> 56:21.760
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

56:27.600 --> 56:45.760
Doesn't it always seem like the parts that made us laugh now make us cry.

56:46.960 --> 56:54.160
Doesn't it always seem like the villain pulling the strings is a regular guy.

56:55.120 --> 56:59.440
You and me have gone bad in a good way.

56:59.440 --> 57:00.640
I promise.

57:03.360 --> 57:08.800
Kerosene wipes clean what we couldn't bear to tarnish.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.360
I'll be all right.

57:13.360 --> 57:18.880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.520
I'll be all right.

57:21.520 --> 57:36.880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

57:51.520 --> 58:06.880
There's a conundrum in the wisdom of my spirit.

58:06.880 --> 58:14.880
Whitewashed hymns in the deadliest sins push me to my limit.

58:15.760 --> 58:24.240
When you deconstruct, you're shit out of luck for a minute.

58:24.240 --> 58:30.240
After the last spin, you can break it all down to rebuild it.

58:44.880 --> 58:52.880
You and me have gone bad in a good way.

58:52.880 --> 58:54.880
I promise.

58:54.880 --> 59:00.880
You and me have gone bad in a good way.

59:00.880 --> 59:02.880
I promise.

59:02.880 --> 59:06.880
I'll be all right.

59:06.880 --> 59:12.880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.

59:12.880 --> 59:14.880
I'll be all right.

59:14.880 --> 59:22.880
I can go there now that I've stared death in the face.
