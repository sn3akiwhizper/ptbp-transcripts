00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Mike Smith here. Thank you again for joining us during our pledge drive this week.

00:05.600 --> 00:14.320
You've just heard Under the Mulberry Tree with Mary Ann Kellans and we're about to get into

00:14.320 --> 00:23.280
into a classic episode of our Smash It! Surprise, surprise Smash It!

00:24.240 --> 00:31.620
Not everyone around here was rooting for this show but by god it's it's really

00:31.620 --> 00:41.240
taken off. It's of course pretending to be people. An unlikely hit for 694.2

00:41.240 --> 00:51.360
but but a hit nonetheless. I'm joined here today by Nyle Leota who...

00:51.360 --> 00:58.680
Nyle Leota Oda. Nyle Leota I'm not gonna say the last that can't be your... Nyle Leota

00:58.680 --> 01:08.320
Oda who who has come here and joined her. As you know me Mike Smith I've been at

01:08.320 --> 01:13.680
this station for 35 years ever since I graduated from community college here in

01:13.680 --> 01:22.360
contention and you know for a long time things were kind of done Mike's way but

01:22.360 --> 01:28.960
Nyle has come in with with his uh you know his big city ideas. Listeners may

01:28.960 --> 01:36.040
remember me from my show with my ex-wife over on KITI in the city. No one

01:36.040 --> 01:43.200
listens to city radio. And I'm back here in contention under some interesting

01:43.200 --> 01:47.360
circumstances but I've got a lot of great ideas to shake up the way things

01:47.360 --> 01:55.760
we do here at 694.2 PTBP. Now you're from here right Nyle? I am yes. And you were you had a

01:55.760 --> 02:01.640
you had a I understand a successful public radio career in the city. I did

02:01.640 --> 02:09.640
indeed. Until you were... until I came back to contention to bring my fantastic pieces to

02:09.640 --> 02:15.440
694.2 PTBP. You didn't you didn't have a successful marriage advice show with

02:15.440 --> 02:19.800
your wife and then you got divorced. And then let's talk about how our listeners

02:19.800 --> 02:27.560
can support us during this pledge drive week Mike. As as you know Nyle has

02:27.560 --> 02:33.200
brought pretending to be people to our to our station and he's brought with it

02:33.200 --> 02:41.120
a something called a Patreon. Patreon.com slash pretending pod. Thanks Nyle. You're

02:41.120 --> 02:49.280
welcome Mike. You know Nyle public radio to me is it's responsible reporting

02:49.280 --> 02:53.800
twice a day you've got your morning edition and you're all things considered

02:53.800 --> 03:00.320
and then in between you know in a small town you got a lot of time for a

03:00.400 --> 03:06.960
traditional Celtic music for bluegrass for jazz we didn't have a lot of you

03:06.960 --> 03:14.880
know fancy gunplay cop shows going on in this town before you got here but then

03:14.880 --> 03:18.120
you brought us a little something called pretending to be people and people just

03:18.120 --> 03:24.760
love it. Yes Mike. Don't they Mike? I believe that grass should be green like the color of money

03:24.760 --> 03:29.480
speaking of which we've got a patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod now I

03:29.560 --> 03:34.080
want to say some new things to bring to that patreon don't you I do there's

03:34.080 --> 03:39.720
currently a five dollar tier there and we've got some fantastic supporters at

03:39.720 --> 03:44.560
that five dollar tier currently called honorary police officers I'd like to

03:44.560 --> 03:48.520
give a quick shout out to three of those honorary police officers right now

03:48.520 --> 03:55.760
Sasha S Brian C and Jasmine J thank you all so much for listening and

03:55.760 --> 04:03.360
contributing to making sure that we can keep making PTBP at 694.2 with

04:03.360 --> 04:08.200
pretending to be people thank you very much to everyone who has supported the

04:08.200 --> 04:12.080
station and will continue to support it throughout this pledge drive so the

04:12.080 --> 04:17.200
changes let's get into those are right off the bat here first off that five

04:17.200 --> 04:23.320
dollar tier is no longer going to be called honorary police officers at five

04:23.360 --> 04:28.760
dollars you'll still get the bonus content on a monthly basis but the name

04:28.760 --> 04:35.600
has changed from honorary police officers to splashylvania fastpass

04:35.600 --> 04:40.920
holder so if I'm getting this right everyone who was currently an honorary

04:40.920 --> 04:47.800
police officer will be a splashylvania fastpass holder isn't that fun and I'm

04:47.840 --> 04:56.800
also here to introduce not only the $10 tier but also a $15 tier and a $30 tier

04:56.800 --> 05:04.480
but we're not stopping there we're also adding both a 50 and even a $100 tier to

05:04.480 --> 05:09.760
keep this sinking boat afloat you think people are gonna pay $100 for your shitty

05:09.760 --> 05:15.460
little again this is Nile Liotta Oda at 694.2 PTBP let's go ahead and

05:15.500 --> 05:19.020
introduce this first clip from an old classic episode of pretending to be

05:19.020 --> 05:24.300
people as you all know during pledge drives we like to play classic episodes

05:24.300 --> 05:30.640
of your favorite public radio content and then interrupt them incessantly to

05:30.640 --> 05:35.380
the point where they're essentially incoherent you just get a little bit and

05:35.380 --> 05:40.860
then ten minutes of two assholes talking maybe just one and now let's cut to a

05:40.860 --> 05:46.220
clip from an episode the listeners voted on as their favorite episode of

05:46.220 --> 05:56.100

06:13.980 --> 06:20.300

08:31.200 --> 08:34.940

so yeah nile that's that's your new show that you've brought here obviously that

09:49.300 --> 09:55.540
is an hour of bluegrass we won't get each week that brings us down to

09:55.540 --> 10:00.100
approximately 12 hours of bluegrass a day which I personally think is the

10:00.100 --> 10:04.460
right amount of bluegrass for our listeners on all of the polls that we've

10:04.460 --> 10:09.060
done yeah you haven't gone down to to Joe's coffee and ask the people there

10:09.060 --> 10:12.820
what they're listening to in the morning the people at beans on beans know what

10:12.820 --> 10:17.300
I'm talking about shout out to everyone down at beans on beans and my new

10:17.340 --> 10:23.100
morning hotspot the donut hole is I haven't been downtown in 30 years since

10:23.100 --> 10:26.940
it was revitalized as are these contention businesses these are

10:26.940 --> 10:32.660
fantastic contention businesses with owners like Duncan Hole do you want a

10:32.660 --> 10:38.900
laugh line there Nile pretending to public radio is a damn I'm sorry folks

10:38.900 --> 10:44.460
public radio is a responsibility Nile it's not cheap entertainment it's not

10:45.100 --> 10:51.380
it's not cops you know it's not America's most wanted it's jazz and

10:51.380 --> 10:59.180
bluegrass damn it at least it isn't in this state it's okay intern if we could

10:59.180 --> 11:04.620
get some tissues in here for Mike I'm fine I'm fine why don't you tell us

11:04.620 --> 11:09.900
about your patreon tears absolutely I would be very excited to do that so

11:09.900 --> 11:16.860
let's wipe away some of those te ars tears and get hyped up for some new TI

11:16.860 --> 11:24.860
er s tears over on patreon.com slash pretending pod just to reiterate if you

11:24.860 --> 11:31.420
are currently pledged at $5 a month the only change is your name as a

11:31.420 --> 11:37.300
splashylvania fast pass holder you will still have access to the exclusive

11:37.340 --> 11:43.060
monthly bonus content in the form of an audio episode what happened to the title

11:43.060 --> 11:48.740
of honorary police officer you ask well we thought it was a better fit for the

11:48.740 --> 11:56.540
rewards offered in our brand-new $10 tier now patrons who pledged $10 a month

11:56.540 --> 12:02.580
become honorary police officers and will not only have access to the exclusive

12:02.620 --> 12:09.380
monthly bonus content but they will also have the opportunity to submit the name

12:09.380 --> 12:17.420
and description of an NPC and a location these submissions will be drawn at

12:17.420 --> 12:22.260
random and used in the show pretending to be people well now Nile normally we

12:22.260 --> 12:27.720
don't agree but it makes a lot of sense for the people who get to participate to

12:27.720 --> 12:32.540
be honorary police officers and for that to move to the $10 tier instead of the

12:32.540 --> 12:37.140
$5 tier thank you so much for saying that Mike it's maybe the one good idea

12:37.140 --> 12:42.700
you've ever had oh that brings joy to my heart and with joy I'd like to move on

12:42.700 --> 12:49.660
and tell you about the $15 tier at patreon.com slash pretending pod people

12:49.660 --> 12:58.740
who pledge $15 a month will join the den of sin that sounds inappropriate now

12:58.740 --> 13:04.980
Nile tell me what that is people who pledge at the $15 level will have access

13:04.980 --> 13:10.860
to a monthly live stream of the pretending to be people crew recording

13:10.860 --> 13:17.700
their patreon bonus content and that will include a hangout after for about

13:17.700 --> 13:22.140
an hour hour and a half who knows how long it could go and they'll be playing

13:22.140 --> 13:29.300
games answering questions it's going to be a bonafide uncanny hootenanny a

13:29.300 --> 13:34.220
binging shindig for those of you who want a behind-the-scenes look at the

13:34.220 --> 13:39.020
process or who'd want to kick it with the pretending to be people crew this

13:39.020 --> 13:48.900
tier is for you again that is the $15 a month tier the den of sin quick shout

the red light coming down on all of you and Oh right above your heads you see

17:03.660 --> 17:11.220
that there is what seems to be a gauge that is a red light slowly blinking and

17:11.220 --> 17:16.300
each time it blinks it is lowering so it's like a battery power pack or

17:16.300 --> 17:20.740
something that is lowering and lit in the room the only thing in this room is

17:20.740 --> 17:28.220
a pedestal with a big red button on top and the light above you with each blink

17:28.220 --> 17:47.740
is going okay I ripped the gauge out of the year you all remember gauging I was

17:47.740 --> 17:52.380
at a show one time and I was standing right behind this dude who had huge

17:52.380 --> 17:58.300
gauges and this kid just walked up with a padlock and just hooked it on this

17:58.300 --> 18:05.580
dude's ear and ran away and the guy just chased him I will fill you in on this

18:05.580 --> 18:13.820
they're not called gauges the gauge is the size of them yeah we all fucking know

18:13.820 --> 18:19.860
Keith Vigna pulls out his sidearm and shoots the thing that's beeping

18:19.860 --> 18:23.980
immediately all of your ears start ringing and nothing in the room

18:23.980 --> 18:28.740
lightwise has changed the meter is still lowering but none of you can hear

18:28.740 --> 18:34.420
anything as tinnitus takes over son of a bitch big no fuck don't fire your

18:34.420 --> 18:38.340

18:56.500 --> 19:02.100
bar lights all the way back up and then continues to beep and is making its way

19:02.100 --> 19:07.300

19:07.300 --> 19:18.220

19:40.900 --> 19:44.940
beeping well what if hey guys what if we let the button go down to the bottom and

19:44.940 --> 19:48.860
instead of some of the bad happenings the door opens Jedidiah is at the

19:48.860 --> 19:55.500
back door just trying to open it back up and he's like Jedidiah is this not your

19:55.500 --> 20:02.560
trailer yeah so it is but you forgot okay well Clark is gonna go look at the

20:02.560 --> 20:06.440
gauge more closely is it is it demarcated in any way is it is that the

20:06.440 --> 20:09.520
right word demarcated does it have markings on it that indicate levels or

20:09.520 --> 20:15.440
numbers or anything that's a great word Joe no it is simply just like just let

20:15.440 --> 20:21.000
up the lights go back to the top and did you say it was coming out of the ceiling

20:21.000 --> 20:25.320
yes it's coming out of the ceiling can I follow it to the top and see if it runs

20:25.320 --> 20:34.120
to anything like a like a like a conduit go ahead and roll search it was

20:34.120 --> 20:38.840
it was coming out of the ceiling but then I chased it in a rant fail 81 on a

20:38.840 --> 20:44.480
20 as you're like trying to find some sort of connection between the two you

20:44.480 --> 20:49.760
kind of trip backwards in the mostly darkness and press the button again

20:49.760 --> 20:54.240
attaboy Clark that's what I was just trying to make sure want to make sure we

20:54.240 --> 20:56.160
kept the button pressed that's all I was doing

20:56.160 --> 21:00.360
Keith Vigna looks around is there anything in this trailer no it is

21:00.360 --> 21:06.040

21:06.040 --> 21:09.640

21:12.560 --> 21:18.080
stand there button and I grab his hand and start edging it towards I don't want

21:18.080 --> 21:22.180
to press the button but I do want to make a good impression on my new

21:22.180 --> 21:29.060
co-workers yeah so I go up to the button and I have my hand about like a

21:29.060 --> 21:37.780
couple inches away from it and I go and just press it a bunch of times each time

21:37.780 --> 21:41.580
it beeps and each time light goes right back to the top Keith we said you could

21:41.580 --> 21:45.540
press the button once can I see anything else in this room if I maybe go past the

21:45.540 --> 21:49.680
button as you pass the button you're not sure if you walking over there triggered

21:49.680 --> 21:57.720
this or if it just started but you feel your socks are wet and looking down you

21:57.720 --> 22:02.960
can't quite tell if it's the red from the light or whether the liquid is red

22:02.960 --> 22:14.840
that is slowly rising in this room and you're all stepping in a red viscous

22:14.840 --> 22:38.120
liquid no hell welcome back welcome back to six nine four point two PT BP why

22:38.120 --> 22:44.120

22:44.120 --> 22:51.120
Smith and we're joining I'm your host you're you're my co-host this is that's

22:51.120 --> 22:57.120
right yeah and we're joined now by Floyd Grant our late night DJ here at six nine

22:57.120 --> 23:02.080
four point two PT BP you're listening to the pledge drive over on patreon.com

23:02.080 --> 23:08.040
slash pretending pod Floyd how's it going today thanks for having me Nile and

23:08.040 --> 23:14.000
Mike it's good to see ya obviously who Floyd now it's probably a little earlier

23:14.040 --> 23:17.800
than you're used to being here I reckon there's a whole bunch of your audience

23:17.800 --> 23:21.960
that don't even know who I am haha yeah hey you know they tend to they

23:21.960 --> 23:26.720
tend to they tend to hit the sack early it can get pretty lonely here being here

23:26.720 --> 23:29.720
that late I hear you guys pitter-pattering outside the door but

23:29.720 --> 23:33.440
nobody ever comes in to say hey we're not here when you're here I've literally

23:33.440 --> 23:42.200
never been here oh I hear you're no easy it's very anti public radio ethos the

23:42.400 --> 23:46.560
spirit of the effort we're all putting into this but Niles only here from nine

23:46.560 --> 23:50.480
to five well I guess it's the janitor crew or something the janitor crew I

23:50.480 --> 23:54.960
believe we had to cut due to costs so the trash is always empty every time I'm

23:54.960 --> 23:58.120
in here I'll just figure that's the janitor crew and the floors are all

23:58.120 --> 24:02.020
sopping wet and oh well you can tell they're brushing their mops against the

24:02.020 --> 24:05.720
walls there's scratches all over the walls I try and if I see him

24:05.720 --> 24:09.880
exterminators must have been slacking on the job or something I don't what do you

24:09.880 --> 24:14.240
mean like a creatures getting in at night or it's here all the time you're

24:14.240 --> 24:18.640
the only creature that gets in here at night buddy from the hours of seven to

24:18.640 --> 24:22.840
nine obviously they do call me the creature I think you should have gotten

24:22.840 --> 24:28.080
the memo that we do no longer have trash service you are supposed to be taking

24:28.080 --> 24:31.940
your own trash out each night I haven't I haven't been is but it's so well it's

24:31.940 --> 24:35.760

24:35.760 --> 24:39.720

much for pledging your support to PT BP 6 9 4.2 and pretending to be people yes

26:38.080 --> 26:45.840
thank you Sam T for supporting you know this new little show that's on our our

26:45.840 --> 26:50.360
radio station instead of every other thing we put out for you 24 hours a day

26:50.360 --> 26:58.320
that that's got a that's got a strong sound to it I like I like that fella now

26:58.320 --> 27:04.680
Floyd you were talking about something strange going on here in the station do

27:04.680 --> 27:08.480
you want to elaborate on that for our listeners here well it just seems to me

27:08.480 --> 27:15.040
we don't want Mike if you interrupt him for once do we want listeners knowing

27:15.040 --> 27:19.560
about I think that the listeners would be very glad to know that they are every

27:19.560 --> 27:25.600
dollar you donate to this station will go to an unhaunted radio station it's

27:25.600 --> 27:30.560
not haunted like people are saying well we might be able to afford a janitorial

27:30.560 --> 27:35.000
staff if we get enough money and some of these issues might be resolved you said

27:35.000 --> 27:38.880
the floors were wet it's it's told me for a loop here that you're telling me

27:38.880 --> 27:43.920
that the the janitors are not doing their jobs lately because they're gone

27:43.920 --> 27:48.200
there we we had to fire them because of no money but it's not haunted but

27:48.200 --> 27:51.840
everything is so it's like they spilled their mop buckets in some of the carpets

27:51.840 --> 27:57.200
here and there and the floors are shiny and bright like they've been picked

27:57.200 --> 28:04.600
clean you are a late-night DJ maybe some of your you know exuberant habits

28:04.600 --> 28:08.320
between the hours of seven and nine

28:10.560 --> 28:15.840
that's the tornado drill that's just the the local tornado drill sirens those

28:15.840 --> 28:19.560
happen randomly throughout the day at all times that did not sound like a

28:19.920 --> 28:26.680
no no no no now you see at 8 a.m. is it on top of the station they do the

28:26.680 --> 28:31.920
tornado siren drills at Wednesdays at 8 a.m. and then also just randomly

28:31.920 --> 28:37.000
throughout the week and now back to our classic fan favorite episode of

28:37.000 --> 28:41.640
pretending to be people entitled can I just say before before we get back to

28:41.640 --> 28:47.400
your nonsense it is unconscionable to suggest that the radio station is

28:47.400 --> 28:52.240
haunted by any kind of those kinds of assumptions might be your downfall Mike

28:52.240 --> 28:57.320
back to the episode Keith's first day

28:58.960 --> 29:04.600
Lindsay Manstein looks down the barrel of their gun at this little green man

29:04.600 --> 29:10.240
Ames pulls the trigger roll firearms

29:10.240 --> 29:16.120
hell yeah that's a crit success baby no way oh shit okay roll 2d 10 for damage

29:16.120 --> 29:27.640
the same thing you just rolled fuck off I got another another crit success 22

29:27.640 --> 29:34.160
22 so actually we're poor damage is weirdly enough when you fire a bullet

29:34.200 --> 29:40.560
into this tiny little green man you just obliterate him but looking out all

29:40.560 --> 29:47.680
around the first Church of contention sanctuary you see you've got 45 more to

29:47.680 --> 29:54.440
go exactly I look over at Keith big na big na sack up let's do this as soon as

29:54.440 --> 30:00.600
I hear that I pull the shotgun off of my back

30:01.440 --> 30:08.800
you fight four times yeah okay into the crowd of alien okay have Keith roll

30:08.800 --> 30:17.920
firearms at a negative negative 40 I've got a 70 within that's a fail all right

30:17.920 --> 30:22.720
so you just blast in and they're all like literally like jumping and four of

30:22.720 --> 30:27.960
them that you aim at actually each time you aim at one they jump on to the top

30:27.960 --> 30:32.120
head of the one next to them and then like the next one you aim at jumps on

30:32.120 --> 30:36.400
top of the second one and they create this like wizard staff of small green

30:36.400 --> 30:41.920
alien man so I had stand I hit none of them and each time they jump on top of

30:41.920 --> 30:46.800
each other they're like and then when they're all on top they like pogo stick

30:46.800 --> 30:56.640
away I have unloaded my shotgun and hit no one and therefore it's no longer your

30:56.640 --> 31:03.720
turn and so yeah I take my time to put some more shotgun shells and not pay

31:03.720 --> 31:07.360
attention to where they're going John Lee Pettymore what are you doing John

31:07.360 --> 31:13.560
gets down on one knee oh yeah and he he takes his he takes his gun and he he

31:13.560 --> 31:19.680
aims his service pistol at each one of those four little fucking brains on that

31:19.680 --> 31:25.000
pogo stick and he's like die you alien scum and he pulls the trigger

31:25.200 --> 31:34.360
firearms baby that's a crit success holy shit okay that'll take out three of

31:34.360 --> 31:39.840
them so as they're like pogoing away from you you take out the top three and

31:39.840 --> 31:46.400
all of their like green splatter just like falls into the baptism pool at the

31:46.400 --> 31:51.480
top of the like sanctuary on the other side of the podium where every Sunday

31:51.480 --> 31:58.680
pastor Adam Kane gives his sermons and with that it is all of the aliens turn

31:58.680 --> 32:07.000
and they all start at the same time and it grows and grows and the power sends a

32:07.000 --> 32:11.840
sound wave like a shock through all of your bodies I need everyone to roll

32:11.840 --> 32:22.240
power I pass a 6 on a 60 oh nice I pass a 12 on a 50 well done I pass a 28 on a

32:22.240 --> 32:31.320
65 rare I fail a 58 on a 50 medium rare you dumb dumb so in that exact moment

32:31.320 --> 32:38.600
Lindsey Manstein you feel your brain begin to compress and like pulse you

32:38.600 --> 32:47.600
lose let's roll of dice six damage as you feel liquid come out of your left

32:47.600 --> 32:54.880
and right ears and you feel up there you feel up your face and there's blood just

32:54.880 --> 33:00.920
dripping from your ears I look at Clark and I'm like Clark I don't feel so good

33:00.920 --> 33:05.200
Clark Bishop it's your turn I want to line up a shot that takes out as many of

33:05.200 --> 33:10.680
them in a row as I can straight through these squishy gringo I like that like

33:10.680 --> 33:14.320
they're still stacked on top of each other not all of the room is full of

33:14.320 --> 33:22.920
these guys yeah full of little fellas angles all right so roll intelligence to

33:22.920 --> 33:30.520
find the right angle to shoot at first I pass a 52 on a 55 all right now roll

33:30.520 --> 33:39.680
firearms straight up and down to take out as many of them as possible I don't

33:39.680 --> 33:44.520
know I think it kind of added to the whole podcast

33:44.880 --> 33:55.840
Zach that's a 22 oh my god he's not even lying about our special issue living in

33:55.840 --> 34:04.000
some sort of weird gravity in this room like okay roll 2d 10 a 9 and a 3 holy

34:04.000 --> 34:09.120
shit okay so 12 knock out three of them so you've got this lineup of three of

34:09.120 --> 34:14.260
them in your sights there's like one on a pew one on the lectern and then one

34:14.260 --> 34:18.720
hanging from a the Christian flag you know have you guys ever seen the

34:18.720 --> 34:24.040
Christian flag I've seen the methodist flag not the Christian flag every church

34:24.040 --> 34:28.400
that I like went to growing up had the American flag right next to the

34:28.400 --> 34:34.840
Christian flag a very very strange choice of idols so one is hanging down

34:34.840 --> 34:40.040
and the flag just bus and like it's almost like a like an ink package and

34:40.040 --> 34:45.080
ink cartridge from like a money bag that you would steal a robbing and it just

34:45.080 --> 34:51.700
banking bus this like green guck all over the flag and as soon as the flag

34:51.700 --> 34:57.220
has been tarnished you see the stained glass at the very front of the sanctuary

34:57.220 --> 35:04.700
just erupts into tiny tiny little particles of different colored glass all

35:04.700 --> 35:10.580
making up some fucked up white Jesus holding a lamb and it just dissipates

35:10.580 --> 35:17.980
into nothing as this massive version of these tiny little green men that you've

35:17.980 --> 35:23.580
