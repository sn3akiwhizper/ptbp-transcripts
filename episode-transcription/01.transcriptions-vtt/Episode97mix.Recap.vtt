00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
Small beans.

00:01.920 --> 00:03.720
Big beans.

00:03.720 --> 00:05.760
Spicy beans.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.400
Creamy beans.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.440
Those are just a few of the kinds of beans that I love.

00:11.440 --> 00:15.760
But you know which beans I love the most, do ya?

00:15.760 --> 00:16.840
It's y'all.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.960
It's your bean connoisseur, Wolf the Dog,

00:19.960 --> 00:24.960
cooking up a bean stew with you, live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.680
Take your fart medicine, it's about to get gassy.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.280
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Dimitri the Bear,

00:34.280 --> 00:37.720
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.800
A very simple, effective, and cherished action.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.260
They write, dearest Elaine, this one goes out to you.

00:46.260 --> 00:49.460
You've been my friend since longer than the time

00:49.460 --> 00:53.800
when gas is swirled and supernovae shined.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.240
You shared with me your feelings, thoughts, and toys,

00:57.240 --> 01:00.880
and readily endured with me the joys

01:00.880 --> 01:04.160
of Wolf the Dog and our contention boys.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.480
Wow, Dimitri the Bear, it's nice to finally meet

01:07.480 --> 01:10.500
another insert name, the animal.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.480
We may be few, but we are powerful.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.320
Ow!

01:15.260 --> 01:18.640
Also, good poem or whatever.

01:18.640 --> 01:22.940
But as a rancid poet, I am simply more clever.

01:22.940 --> 01:26.380
Whenever you write to me again, you better think twice,

01:26.380 --> 01:28.600
because when you'll step into Wolf,

01:28.600 --> 01:31.300
buddy, you're on thin ice.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.360
But I'll allow you just this once to shift the blame,

01:35.360 --> 01:37.480
for I will not embarrass you,

01:37.480 --> 01:41.160
not in front of your dearest Elaine.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.180
This one here is another recap,

01:43.180 --> 01:46.420
a map of the chaps madcap mishaps.

01:46.420 --> 01:51.180
Snap to or I'll slap you, no nap, no cap.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.500
Strap in and lap it up before we wrap it up.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.700
It's kudzu with no backbone.

02:26.700 --> 02:31.700
After the murder of both his brother, Ferguson Beans,

02:32.260 --> 02:35.340
and his brother's partner's mother, Joan Robin,

02:35.340 --> 02:39.160
Keith Vigna, back at Hotel Motel, dreamt

02:39.160 --> 02:41.260
he stood at a bar, empty,

02:41.260 --> 02:43.860
except for himself and the bartender.

02:43.860 --> 02:47.220
The bar was run down, smelled of piss and vomit,

02:47.220 --> 02:51.420
and looked to have been vacated quickly by other customers.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.840
The man behind the bar was dressed in clothing

02:53.840 --> 02:58.840
from the late 1800s, and spoke fearfully to Keith,

02:59.020 --> 03:03.760
asking if he wanted answers or maybe cocaine.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.040
Keith asked for the former,

03:06.040 --> 03:08.480
as he'd had enough of the latter.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.720
The saloon-style door swung open,

03:10.720 --> 03:14.560
allowing the entrance of a woman Keith recognized.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.240
In her hands was a massive trunk,

03:17.240 --> 03:20.440
which she heaved onto the bar and opened.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.400
Inside was the camera red light lit,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.760
the gun also red light lit,

03:25.760 --> 03:29.160
and the radio green light lit.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.120
Seeing this, Keith told the woman

03:31.120 --> 03:34.080
the camera wouldn't be ready until one,

03:34.080 --> 03:37.200
and knowing the other two take a few days,

03:37.200 --> 03:41.720
asked what he should do if they come for him.

03:41.720 --> 03:46.360
As is the way with dreams, Mary was suddenly gone,

03:46.360 --> 03:50.320
and the barkeep, Lloyd, pulled a corkscrew from his pocket

03:50.320 --> 03:53.960
and held it on the bar in front of Keith, pointy side up.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.380
Lloyd then slammed his head into the corkscrew

03:56.380 --> 03:58.720
and held eye contact with Keith,

03:58.720 --> 04:02.520
as little bits of cocaine fell out of the hole in his head.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.320
Keith looked down and found the cocaine had fallen

04:05.320 --> 04:08.520
in the pattern of a stick figure family.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.520
He pulled out a $100 bill sporting the visage

04:12.520 --> 04:15.680
of Abraham Lincoln, and snorted up

04:15.680 --> 04:18.200
this little powder family.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.240
As he did, Lloyd phased through the back of the bar

04:22.240 --> 04:23.720
and out of sight.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.560
Keith came to in his police cruiser,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.040
pulling into the department parking lot.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.960
He had been lost in the dream,

04:30.960 --> 04:34.080
and also running over the gruesome details

04:34.080 --> 04:39.080
of the murder-suicide he had just staged earlier

04:39.400 --> 04:43.360
in the early morning between Joan, Robin,

04:43.360 --> 04:45.780
and Ferguson Beans.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.500
John Lee Pettymore IV was also dreaming,

04:48.500 --> 04:52.220
dreaming he was rolling across the ground with ease,

04:52.220 --> 04:55.860
ignoring a man in a fancy suit who mopped the floor

04:55.860 --> 04:59.480
and mouth trumpeted along with Louis Armstrong.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.300
Outside, the sky appeared dark and stormy.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.920
John seemed to be inside a closed store,

05:05.920 --> 05:09.060
but the door opened anyway, triggering the bell above.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.500
John looked up to the figure in the doorway,

05:11.500 --> 05:15.140
unable to identify them through the black cloak they wore,

05:15.140 --> 05:20.140
and this figure dropped a massive book on the ground

05:20.420 --> 05:23.860
before stumbling back into the night.

05:23.860 --> 05:27.780
John's vision began to distort, and he became disoriented.

05:27.780 --> 05:31.100
As it cleared, he found that he was a baby again,

05:31.100 --> 05:34.260
sitting on the floor in the back of clinkers.

05:34.260 --> 05:38.020
A young Gary Daley walked into the daycare at clinkers

05:38.020 --> 05:41.900
and pulled a large leather tome from his pack.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.420
He looked over his shoulder,

05:43.460 --> 05:45.820
and turning his attention back to the book,

05:45.820 --> 05:50.180
winced and ripped a page from the spine.

05:50.180 --> 05:54.660
He paused, listened, and then stowed the book away

05:54.660 --> 05:58.340
before approaching John with the stray page.

05:58.340 --> 06:01.580
Daley pulled a knife from his bag and began to chant,

06:01.580 --> 06:05.260
reading from the paper, the script on which seemed to spark

06:05.260 --> 06:07.180
as he spoke the words.

06:07.180 --> 06:10.180
He continued to chant as he drew blood from his thumb

06:10.180 --> 06:13.000
and let it drip onto baby John.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.840
The sparks began to engulf the paper,

06:15.840 --> 06:18.640
and the flames danced around John's head

06:18.640 --> 06:20.400
before disappearing.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.360
Daley spoke to himself as he wiped the blood

06:23.360 --> 06:25.280
from John's head.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.440
"'Grandpa, you old kook, you old wizard,' he sighed.

06:30.460 --> 06:32.100
"'I hope this does him good.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.880
"'Well, two down, one to go.'"

06:34.880 --> 06:37.460
Hey, hey, John, what are you thinking about?

06:37.460 --> 06:40.160
John also came to as he pulled into

06:40.160 --> 06:43.160
the contentioned police department parking lot,

06:43.160 --> 06:46.680
riding shotgun in Drew's cherry-bread Mini Cooper.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.640
Drew, terrified, drove while Rosemary sat in the back

06:50.640 --> 06:53.520
with both the men's guns at the ready.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.920
Clark dreamt he was running,

06:55.920 --> 06:58.920
running because it was imperative that he run,

06:58.920 --> 07:02.080
running because he was close,

07:02.080 --> 07:05.880
because this was a chance to stop them.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.360
He narrowly dodged oncoming traffic

07:08.360 --> 07:11.400
upon realizing suddenly that he was on the highway.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.200
He made it to the bridge, jumped,

07:13.200 --> 07:15.720
and recognized he wouldn't make the water.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.720
He braced for impact.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.900
Clark's shinbone pushed through his kneecap,

07:20.900 --> 07:22.120
but he continued to run,

07:22.120 --> 07:25.400
trailing a stream of blood behind him.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.600
Ahead, Clark saw his old nemesis

07:28.600 --> 07:33.120
and remembered why the animals took refuge in the water.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.960
He jumped in the creek himself,

07:34.960 --> 07:37.080
ignoring the pain in his knee

07:37.080 --> 07:42.080
and this black ooze followed along the shore.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.840
From the river, Clark saw himself

07:44.840 --> 07:46.840
in the window of his own house

07:46.840 --> 07:50.280
and mustered up the strength to climb out from the river.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.300
He called to himself from the backyard.

07:52.300 --> 07:55.840
He told himself to run, to get the fuck out of there.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.840
He told himself he could get it right this time.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.560
Clark jolted awake in the back of the cab.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.060
He noted a tightness in his chest

08:04.100 --> 08:08.780
as the car turned into the parking lot of the contention PD.

08:08.780 --> 08:13.400
It was December 5th, a foggy blustery day in contention.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.420
An old Husky made its way down the road

08:16.420 --> 08:18.940
and paused before fleeing

08:18.940 --> 08:22.420
upon hearing the three cars approach.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.820
The officers had a moment to judge each other's situations.

08:25.820 --> 08:28.300
John turned and finally asked Rosemary's name,

08:28.300 --> 08:31.460
eventually explaining that if she wants the gun,

08:31.460 --> 08:33.940
Drew and John will need theirs back.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.100
Rosemary agreed, but was quick to explain

08:36.100 --> 08:37.940
that if she happened to go missing,

08:37.940 --> 08:41.420
Marvin Glass would find and torture anyone

08:41.420 --> 08:42.820
who might be connected.

08:42.820 --> 08:45.220
The officers noted that a stranger's car

08:45.220 --> 08:49.660
was parked in the lot, a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.220
Clark admitted to the taxi driver he had no money,

08:52.220 --> 08:56.500
but the cabbie explained the ride had been paid for already.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.900
Upon stepping outside, the other two cops wondered

08:59.900 --> 09:03.060
why Clark was dressed in pajamas.

09:03.060 --> 09:06.900
Clark lied saying he'd been sleepwalking.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.460
John smoothed things over between Rosemary

09:09.460 --> 09:11.540
and his nervous partners while insisting

09:11.540 --> 09:14.860
they would all soon be traveling to the city

09:14.860 --> 09:18.260
to deliver the gun to Marvin Glass.

09:18.260 --> 09:22.620
John reminded his partners of Jermaine and Alfred Glass.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.860
Marvin's sons were trying to find the gun.

09:25.860 --> 09:29.000
Given the officer's knowledge of the gun and the sons,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.860
John suggested they might be in a good place

09:31.860 --> 09:35.260
to do business with Marvin, essentially allying

09:35.260 --> 09:38.420
the contention PD with the Glass crime family.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.820
John thought that working together,

09:40.820 --> 09:44.020
they might be able to use the gun to bring people back

09:44.020 --> 09:46.160
from wherever they disappeared to.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.780
They planned to leave for the city

09:47.780 --> 09:50.500
as soon as the gun was in hand.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.340
The officer circled back to a conversation about the husky,

09:53.340 --> 09:57.260
the first animal they'd seen out of the water in days.

09:57.260 --> 10:00.740
They decided to head into the station rather than follow it

10:00.740 --> 10:04.540
when they remembered the strange sports car in their lot.

10:04.540 --> 10:07.740
Keith looked into the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse

10:07.740 --> 10:11.320
and saw a massive container of creatine powder,

10:11.320 --> 10:15.780
empty Red Bull cans, and a pair of Oakleys.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.960
John, wielding two guns, kicked in the door to the station

10:18.960 --> 10:20.440
and shouted the words,

10:20.440 --> 10:24.340
"'Contention PD, freeze, douchebag.'"

10:24.340 --> 10:27.380
A young man in a blue suit and red striped tie

10:27.420 --> 10:29.860
had been pacing the floor of the department

10:29.860 --> 10:32.180
and froze Red Bull in hand.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.980
The man obediently dropped the beverage on the carpet

10:34.980 --> 10:38.120
and invited the officers to take the FBI badge

10:38.120 --> 10:39.520
from his jacket.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.940
This was Agent Trent Chad.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.540
As soon as Clark had the badge,

10:44.540 --> 10:46.460
he tranquilized the agent with a dart

10:46.460 --> 10:47.700
from the circle of knowledge

10:47.700 --> 10:51.180
and Chad became immediately suggestible.

10:51.180 --> 10:54.260
Clark's partners were suspicious of the dart gun,

10:54.260 --> 10:58.000
but Clark explained that his previous night's detour

10:58.000 --> 11:00.900
had informed him the FBI would arrive.

11:00.900 --> 11:04.680
He couldn't give specifics, but this had all been expected.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.460
As the officers decided what to do

11:06.460 --> 11:07.940
with the tranquilized agent,

11:07.940 --> 11:10.860
Drew arrived and saw that Chad had been digging

11:10.860 --> 11:12.700
through the department's files.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.140
When Agent Trent Chad suggested the three present officers

11:16.140 --> 11:18.300
were some of the worst in history,

11:18.300 --> 11:22.220
the crew asked if he had any experience in PR.

11:22.220 --> 11:24.420
Chad had plenty of experience, it turned out,

11:24.420 --> 11:27.580
so the officers devised an impromptu press conference

11:27.580 --> 11:29.500
to calm the population.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.460
They settled on a filmed statement

11:31.460 --> 11:33.840
that confirmed everything was okay,

11:33.840 --> 11:36.260
that the contention PD should be given room

11:36.260 --> 11:37.800
to do what they need to do,

11:37.800 --> 11:39.880
and that everything done so far

11:39.880 --> 11:42.620
had been in the interest of the people.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.300
Having filmed the statement, they told Agent Chad

11:45.300 --> 11:49.140
to convey the same sentiments to his superiors.

11:49.140 --> 11:51.160
As Clark moved to the back of the station

11:51.160 --> 11:53.200
to retrieve his spare clothes,

11:53.200 --> 11:56.080
he noticed the cells were empty.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.800
Though the cell doors were locked,

11:57.800 --> 12:02.160
Dr. Marie Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs had vanished.

12:02.160 --> 12:06.840
Keith suggested they review the security footage.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.160
This footage revealed the cat running wildly

12:10.160 --> 12:13.000
about the station, jumping from spot to spot to spot.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.680
The Jacobs' bodies and their cells were picked up

12:16.680 --> 12:20.420
into the air and slammed into the ground repeatedly

12:20.420 --> 12:25.260
by some unseen force before they disappeared.

12:25.260 --> 12:28.340
The officers noticed the cat had been looking up

12:28.340 --> 12:29.740
when it became scared.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.500
Given the consistent patterns,

12:31.500 --> 12:35.580
they concluded this was all likely the work of the goo.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.020
The officers considered what they knew,

12:38.020 --> 12:40.540
that animals could see or sense the goo,

12:40.540 --> 12:44.180
and that they had the power to become animals themselves

12:44.180 --> 12:45.580
if they needed to.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.660
While discussing the possibilities presented

12:47.660 --> 12:50.100
by the strange evidence they'd collected,

12:50.100 --> 12:53.940
Keith said the camera might be active again at 1 p.m.,

12:53.940 --> 12:56.540
a suspiciously specific thought.

12:56.540 --> 12:59.460
They walked into the evidence locker together

12:59.460 --> 13:01.280
and found the helmet red light lit,

13:01.280 --> 13:04.040
the camera red light lit, the gun red light lit,

13:04.040 --> 13:08.020
and the radio green light lit.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.380
Doug the cat appeared in the locker room

13:10.380 --> 13:13.580
and indicated he had something to say to Keith.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.040
Clark bolted from the room as Doug jumped up onto the shelf

13:17.040 --> 13:20.020
and began to rub along the green lit radio,

13:20.900 --> 13:21.900
fearing a body switch.

13:21.900 --> 13:25.340
Outside, Agent Chad mopped up Red Bull

13:25.340 --> 13:29.260
and Rosemary tapped an impatient foot.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.840
John Lee Pettymore pulled Doug away from the radio

13:31.840 --> 13:34.340
and chided him for the attempt to switch bodies.

13:34.340 --> 13:35.700
The cat became frantic,

13:35.700 --> 13:38.860
but John hugged him tightly to his chest

13:38.860 --> 13:40.940
and began to consider the possibility

13:40.940 --> 13:44.460
of switching the man inside the cat back out

13:44.460 --> 13:46.000
for information.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.420
When Doug agreed to switch with the FBI agent,

13:48.420 --> 13:51.940
the officers suggested Agent Chad sleep

13:51.940 --> 13:55.940
and dragged his unconscious body into the evidence room.

13:55.940 --> 13:57.620
With everything set up for the switch,

13:57.620 --> 13:59.600
the officers listened from outside

13:59.600 --> 14:02.260
as the radio transitioned from music

14:02.260 --> 14:06.500
to a jumble of audio culminating in a high-pitched tone

14:06.500 --> 14:09.220
that screeched in their ears.

14:09.220 --> 14:13.260
A light flashed inside and there was silence.

14:13.260 --> 14:17.060
Soon, they heard Chad's voice from inside.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.020
It was Doug, resituating himself

14:19.020 --> 14:20.860
in the body of the fit agent.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.100
Agent Chad and the cat's body attempted

14:23.100 --> 14:25.540
to make a panicked escape as they opened the door,

14:25.540 --> 14:27.580
but they captured him with Doug's help.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.140
The officers asked Drew to go buy a cat kennel,

14:30.140 --> 14:32.100
prompting a strange look.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.860
Rosemary began to insist on the gun

14:34.860 --> 14:37.660
and the officers became condescending.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.940
She unlocked the police station door and left.

14:40.940 --> 14:42.460
The officers ran after Rosemary

14:42.460 --> 14:45.300
and found her banging on the trunk of Drew's car

14:45.300 --> 14:47.020
as he attempted to back out.

14:47.860 --> 14:48.820
She quashed the potential conflict,

14:48.820 --> 14:52.460
saying she only wanted the briefcase in the back.

14:52.460 --> 14:55.620
With that in hand, she released Drew to his errand.

14:55.620 --> 14:57.220
Despite the tense situation,

14:57.220 --> 14:59.620
Rosemary calmly explained that the case

14:59.620 --> 15:02.260
contained five million dollars.

15:02.260 --> 15:05.180
Content, Rosemary returned to the police station.

15:05.180 --> 15:07.160
John and Clark followed.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.220
Inside, Doug stood marveling at his new body.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.620
He had a very clear memory of what had happened

15:12.620 --> 15:14.060
prior to the body switch,

15:14.100 --> 15:17.380
but before he could explain, he began to panic.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.100
He could see the ooze,

15:19.100 --> 15:21.940
though it was invisible to everyone else.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.220
Clark rushed to the sink

15:23.220 --> 15:25.700
and began to toss water about the station.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.540
John pulled a pipe from the break room sink,

15:28.540 --> 15:31.280
allowing water to flood onto the floor.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.380
Rosemary, unsure of what was happening,

15:33.380 --> 15:37.540
perched calmly on Drew's desk with the briefcase.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.700
They attempted to get more detail from Doug,

15:39.700 --> 15:40.700
but he was terrified.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.540
The water wasn't stopping the ooze.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.140
Doug made a run for the door.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.540
Keith and Clark followed him out to the parking lot,

15:46.540 --> 15:49.140
and there, they found him standing frozen.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.300
Doug's mental state continued to devolve

15:51.300 --> 15:52.960
as they led him to Keith's car,

15:52.960 --> 15:56.520
and their attempts to calm or slap sense into him failed.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.480
Clark confirmed that Doug and Chad's body

15:58.480 --> 16:01.000
was still under the influence of the tranquilizer.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.580
He was able to explain that in the days leading up

16:03.580 --> 16:06.380
to his becoming a cat, he had been sick.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.840
His wife, Marie, had brought the radio in,

16:08.840 --> 16:11.620
and a dream-like blur followed.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.260
He began to disassociate,

16:13.260 --> 16:16.180
claiming they were all part of a dream.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.500
He tried to explain they were not dreaming,

16:18.500 --> 16:21.100
but Clark leaned into the idea.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.620
What was the worst that could happen to Doug

16:22.620 --> 16:24.500
if he helped in the dream?

16:24.500 --> 16:28.000
Inside, John found a vacuum and attempted blindly

16:28.000 --> 16:29.580
to capture the ooze.

16:29.580 --> 16:32.700
In leaping about, he noticed Agent Chad's briefcase

16:32.700 --> 16:34.260
on one of the desks.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.620
Assuming the coast was clear, he opened it,

16:36.620 --> 16:39.660
found several signs, a list, a map,

16:39.660 --> 16:43.740
and a small cell phone jammer that was turned on.

16:43.740 --> 16:45.820
Keith and Clark brought Doug back inside

16:45.820 --> 16:47.880
to see if he still saw the goo.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.840
He didn't, and he became distracted by his reflection

16:50.840 --> 16:52.280
in the break room mirror.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.000
Doug was unsure whether lingering animal instincts

16:55.000 --> 16:56.820
had allowed him to see the goo,

16:56.820 --> 16:58.380
or if it had been an illusion.

16:59.260 --> 17:01.560
He was pretty certain he was still in a dream.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.920
John drew the group's attention to the signs

17:03.920 --> 17:06.000
in Agent Chad's briefcase.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.040
They read,

17:07.040 --> 17:11.800
Attention, a chemical spill from the unincorporated land,

17:11.800 --> 17:15.680
once the town Perdition, just west of contention,

17:15.680 --> 17:17.280
is heading this way.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.640
Please evacuate immediately.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.560
Don't forget your pets.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.320
The list contained all the locations Agent Chad

17:24.320 --> 17:25.980
had planned to place the signs,

17:25.980 --> 17:28.900
and the map detailed all the missing persons

17:28.900 --> 17:30.760
and the dates they disappeared.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.600
All the disappearances occurred

17:32.600 --> 17:35.720
on December 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.480
Marked an explosion in cases across town.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.080
Rosemary stood suddenly and gave the officers

17:43.080 --> 17:45.560
five minutes to turn over the gun.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.020
They used their time to decide

17:47.020 --> 17:50.560
between visiting Perdition or the city.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.480
The officers called Drew and asked him

17:52.480 --> 17:54.820
to put Chad's signs up in town,

17:54.820 --> 17:59.060
but Drew claimed he had seen literally no one on his errand.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.800
No customers in the store, no employees,

18:01.800 --> 18:04.560
no cars on the road, nothing.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.440
But then a car arrived at the station

18:07.440 --> 18:09.080
driven by an older woman.

18:09.080 --> 18:14.080
It was Jan Manstein, the mother of an Ari Manstein,

18:14.400 --> 18:17.860
whose name was not immediately familiar.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.600
Jan had arrived to gather Ari's possessions

18:20.600 --> 18:21.840
from the station.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.740
Her daughter had been killed

18:23.740 --> 18:26.720
in the hospital fire in the city.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.240
The officers recognized that Ari's position

18:29.240 --> 18:33.920
matched that of Ray, or was it Tim, or Lauren,

18:34.760 --> 18:37.960
Florence, who they had sent to the hospital.

18:37.960 --> 18:40.300
As soon as they understood the name switch,

18:40.300 --> 18:42.800
the officers were flooded with memories

18:42.800 --> 18:45.660
of this fourth contentioned police officer,

18:45.660 --> 18:49.800
all of whom they last remembered sending to the hospital

18:49.800 --> 18:52.720
on an ambulance with Rosemary.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.700
Clark tried to console Jan as she cleaned out Ari's desk.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.720
She invited them all to her funeral the following day

18:59.720 --> 19:01.280
at the city cemetery,

19:01.320 --> 19:04.120
where Ari was to be buried with her family.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.760
In the back room, Rosemary eyed the evidence locker

19:07.760 --> 19:11.260
as John interrogated her about the hospital fire.

19:11.260 --> 19:13.740
Rosemary eventually admitted to starting the fire

19:13.740 --> 19:15.280
that killed their colleague.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.200
John insisted that she play it cool while Jan was around.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.280
As Jan finished picking up Ari's things,

19:22.280 --> 19:25.440
she struggled to decide whether or not to tell her husband,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.940
Ari's father, Stan Manstein,

19:27.940 --> 19:31.740
who had been in the city asylum for 28 years.

19:31.740 --> 19:33.100
When John offered to tell him,

19:33.100 --> 19:35.920
she agreed enthusiastically.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.340
Just as Jan was leaving,

19:37.340 --> 19:39.700
they asked if she'd seen anybody about town

19:39.700 --> 19:43.260
as she came through, and she told them she hadn't.

19:43.260 --> 19:44.600
With Jan out of the station,

19:44.600 --> 19:47.880
the officers finally let themselves feel shaken

19:47.880 --> 19:51.980
by the conflicting personas of this mysterious colleague.

19:51.980 --> 19:53.660
The memories seemed to combine

19:53.660 --> 19:56.060
into one almost anonymous individual,

19:56.060 --> 20:00.260
their only connection being the family name, Manstein.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.140
John pulled Rosemary aside again

20:02.140 --> 20:03.860
before they piled into the car.

20:03.860 --> 20:07.820
Out of view, he pushed his pistol to Rosemary's head

20:07.820 --> 20:09.440
and threatened to kill her

20:09.440 --> 20:11.940
if she didn't return Drew's money.

20:11.940 --> 20:15.100
Rosemary surrendered the money and slowly turned

20:15.100 --> 20:19.840
so that the gun's barrel was centered between her eyes.

20:19.840 --> 20:24.840
It's hilarious that you think you can kill me.

20:30.520 --> 20:34.960
She chuckled before walking back out into the station.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.760
John collected himself and stashed the briefcase

20:37.760 --> 20:39.560
in the evidence locker.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.360
An email from Wolf the dog revealed

20:42.360 --> 20:44.600
their PSA was about to air.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.720
The message was followed

20:45.720 --> 20:49.300
by news of the Beans Robin murder suicide.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.260
John and Clark looked up at Keith DeGage's reaction.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.820
Keith stared at the ground

20:53.820 --> 20:56.060
and admitted that Ferguson was his brother

20:56.060 --> 20:58.300
but said he hadn't seen him in a while.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.420
Keith agreed it'd be worthwhile to check in

21:00.420 --> 21:02.900
with the city PD about the crime scene,

21:02.900 --> 21:05.300
the crime scene he had orchestrated.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.340
As the officers headed toward the highway

21:08.340 --> 21:09.900
on their way to the city,

21:09.900 --> 21:13.000
they confirmed the utter abandonment of contention.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.820
Gone were the runners, the beggars,

21:14.820 --> 21:16.820
the teenagers and their pot smoking.

21:16.820 --> 21:18.900
Gone too were the protests.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.780
The town would have been silent

21:20.780 --> 21:23.740
if not for the distant sound of other cars

21:23.740 --> 21:27.000
and the cries of abandoned animals from the creek.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.420
Given that two of the cruisers

21:28.420 --> 21:30.140
had been involved in accidents,

21:30.140 --> 21:32.460
the officers told Rosemary to lead the way

21:32.460 --> 21:36.180
and they piled into a single cruiser with Doug Chad.

21:36.180 --> 21:39.140
The crew stopped by Clark's spotless garage

21:39.140 --> 21:42.380
to ransack the US military branded crates

21:42.380 --> 21:45.000
they had stolen from John Peter's storage units

21:45.000 --> 21:47.340
for pistols, shotguns, rifles,

21:47.340 --> 21:49.940
a shoulder mounted anti-aircraft weapon,

21:49.940 --> 21:52.180
an EMP rifle, a grappling gun,

21:52.180 --> 21:54.420
a small gun that shot tracers,

21:54.420 --> 21:56.480
lots of grenades, a sniper rifle

21:56.480 --> 21:59.420
and a very tiny but powerful gun.

21:59.420 --> 22:02.500
Each of the officers also donned body armor

22:02.500 --> 22:05.340
and packed a small bag of cocaine.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.640
They remembered at the very last moment

22:07.640 --> 22:10.340
to bring the strange gun and camera

22:10.340 --> 22:12.980
with the odd glass tubes.

22:12.980 --> 22:14.020
On the ride to the city,

22:14.020 --> 22:16.420
John placed a call to Harry Klinker

22:16.420 --> 22:18.340
and immediately realized they had packed

22:18.340 --> 22:21.540
and failed to deactivate the cell phone jammer.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.300
As John waited for Harry to pick up,

22:23.300 --> 22:26.020
Keith began to receive missed calls

22:26.020 --> 22:28.180
and voicemail notifications.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.960
On the phone, John asked Harry

22:29.960 --> 22:31.780
if he knew where everyone had gone

22:31.780 --> 22:34.140
but the gravel-voiced man could only guess.

22:34.140 --> 22:36.700
Harry, in turn, began to ask about the actions

22:36.700 --> 22:38.540
of the officers and lie the protests

22:38.540 --> 22:42.260
but was happy to side with his daycare alumni.

22:42.260 --> 22:45.320
Harry was always something of a confidant for the officers

22:45.320 --> 22:48.040
and so John began spilling details

22:48.040 --> 22:50.160
of the bizarre events they had witnessed

22:50.160 --> 22:51.400
in the last few days,

22:51.400 --> 22:54.040
much to the surprise of everyone else in the car,

22:54.040 --> 22:56.280
especially Doug Jacobs.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.960
Harry expressed some worry

22:57.960 --> 23:01.600
suggesting a spiritualist might be useful to John

23:01.600 --> 23:05.160
so John inquired about Harry's partner, Gary Daley,

23:05.160 --> 23:07.760
who dabbled in acting as a medium.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.000
Harry admitted Gary hadn't come home the night before.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.720
He did say that Gary had been meeting

23:12.720 --> 23:14.780
with his book group more regularly,

23:14.780 --> 23:16.900
a gathering of occultists that included

23:16.900 --> 23:19.700
Dr. Marie Jacobs and Mildred Mitchell.

23:19.700 --> 23:23.260
John thanked the barman and ended the call.

23:23.260 --> 23:25.900
Keith had received a single text

23:25.900 --> 23:28.780
and four voicemails while the jammer had been active,

23:28.780 --> 23:31.180
all from John Lee Pettymore IV.

23:31.180 --> 23:33.860
John ranted about Keith breaking in,

23:33.860 --> 23:35.540
fucking with his Smokies,

23:35.540 --> 23:39.060
and admitted that he had $5 million.

23:39.060 --> 23:40.540
The group texted Drew,

23:40.540 --> 23:43.900
asking him to keep an eye on contention in their absence.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.940
Doug Chad clarified that his central motivation

23:46.940 --> 23:48.480
was returning to his own body,

23:48.480 --> 23:51.980
but that he was willing to help for some cash on the side.

23:51.980 --> 23:53.240
At Doug's suggestion,

23:53.240 --> 23:55.940
the officers called Gary Daley on speakerphone

23:55.940 --> 23:57.600
and after several rings,

23:57.600 --> 23:59.900
they heard Gary in the middle of a conversation.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.580
I told you, you old witch, you're just going crazy,

24:02.580 --> 24:04.540
you know, that's all, that's fine,

24:04.540 --> 24:06.660
and we can deal with that, hello.

24:06.660 --> 24:09.340
The group suggested Gary check in with Harry.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.100
When they asked about the witch,

24:11.100 --> 24:13.540
Gary explained he was chatting with Mildred Mitchell,

24:14.060 --> 24:17.140
the grandmother of Tildy B. Mitchell at her house.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.900
She was suffering a breakdown of sorts.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.940
See, Mildred was under the impression

24:21.940 --> 24:24.300
that her histories have been split,

24:24.300 --> 24:27.220
and she has become obsessed with a picture

24:27.220 --> 24:29.540
of the founders of contention.

24:29.540 --> 24:32.300
Silas Cole, she insisted, looked different

24:32.300 --> 24:33.460
than he did before,

24:33.460 --> 24:37.180
less attractive and possibly stupider.

24:37.180 --> 24:40.140
Mildred also believed she could see the reflection

24:40.140 --> 24:42.280
of Tildy B. in the photo.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.400
The officers were shaken by the thought

24:44.400 --> 24:49.000
that the gun at least appeared to send people back in time,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.520
and the split histories could explain in part

24:51.520 --> 24:53.800
their mysterious colleague, Ari.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.720
John asked about Gary's grandfather

24:55.720 --> 24:57.560
and described the recent dream

24:57.560 --> 25:01.120
in which Gary had performed a protection ritual on John.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.480
Gary admitted this had indeed occurred

25:03.480 --> 25:06.820
and went on to say his grandfather, Gingerfred,

25:06.820 --> 25:10.360
had passed down a book with three pages left

25:10.440 --> 25:13.120
and instructed Gary to read those pages

25:13.120 --> 25:17.080
over the heads of the boys, spilling blood in the process.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.920
The reason for this, Gary's grandfather had explained,

25:19.920 --> 25:24.920
was that the three men were the key to everything.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.240
They thanked the owner of the Daily Pho

25:27.240 --> 25:30.060
and prepared to enter the city.

25:30.980 --> 25:34.120
The streets of the city were drab, gray,

25:34.120 --> 25:35.920
and littered with trash.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.300
A foul smell hung in the air

25:38.300 --> 25:41.420
and billboards covered the faces of buildings.

25:41.420 --> 25:45.340
The city residents seemed bloated and lifeless.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.800
In opposition to the industrial gloom,

25:47.800 --> 25:51.340
flowers of every shade and shape grew in the alleys

25:51.340 --> 25:53.340
and from cracks in the pavement.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.960
Rosemary led the officers downtown

25:55.960 --> 25:58.940
to a tall granite skyscraper.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.100
In a small surveilled parking garage,

26:01.100 --> 26:03.820
Rosemary gestured for the officers to enter

26:03.820 --> 26:07.460
a small elevator made of polished onyx.

26:07.460 --> 26:11.220
Everyone, including Rosemary, agreed that Doug's presence

26:11.220 --> 26:15.640
as FBI might prove valuable leverage.

26:15.640 --> 26:20.640
Rosemary remained in the garage though as the doors closed.

26:21.460 --> 26:24.920
The elevator contained no buttons or floor indicators

26:24.920 --> 26:28.260
and for a while it seemed as though it didn't move at all.

26:28.260 --> 26:30.900
As John held the gun artifact up to the ceiling

26:30.900 --> 26:32.660
and called for an audience,

26:32.660 --> 26:37.180
one of the walls opened into a dark room.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.300
A spotlight in the center of the room

26:39.300 --> 26:42.460
partially lit Marvin Glass.

26:42.460 --> 26:47.060
A humanoid figure with a massive gaunt frame

26:47.060 --> 26:52.040
dressed in a fitted black tuxedo and a red bow tie.

26:52.040 --> 26:55.620
The lower half of Marvin's face was visible in the light.

26:55.620 --> 26:59.140
The skin there appeared hairless and translucent.

26:59.140 --> 27:02.180
Above the sharp see-through chin,

27:02.180 --> 27:07.180
a candy red lipstick messily encircled a round hole.

27:07.460 --> 27:11.140
The orifice began to move as Marvin Glass

27:11.140 --> 27:14.720
introduced themself and asked if the crew knew

27:14.720 --> 27:16.860
why they were in this room.

27:16.860 --> 27:18.220
The officers weren't sure.

27:18.220 --> 27:21.260
Marvin explained that Ferguson Beans had been trying

27:21.260 --> 27:24.740
to buy cocaine from a contention police officer.

27:24.740 --> 27:28.620
Cocaine that had been stolen from Marvin Glass.

27:28.620 --> 27:31.380
Rosemary was sent to collect the money from the deal.

27:31.420 --> 27:34.460
This surprised John who hastily suggested

27:34.460 --> 27:36.940
he knew nothing about the cocaine deal

27:36.940 --> 27:39.980
and Glass called out the lie for what it was.

27:39.980 --> 27:42.540
The officers were confused.

27:42.540 --> 27:44.800
Rosemary had been insistent about the gun

27:44.800 --> 27:47.320
but Marvin said he sent her specifically

27:47.320 --> 27:48.500
to recover the money.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.740
They pulled Doug Chad aside and instructed him

27:50.740 --> 27:53.920
to say the money had been confiscated by the FBI.

27:53.920 --> 27:57.980
Marvin flew into a rage before quickly calming down.

27:57.980 --> 28:01.580
He explained that Alfred's state was pitiable

28:01.580 --> 28:04.500
but not the current concern.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.800
John clarified it was germane they were hoping

28:06.800 --> 28:08.540
to return to Marvin.

28:08.540 --> 28:10.280
John laid the situation out.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.260
It wouldn't be long before whatever haunted contention

28:13.260 --> 28:15.720
made its way into the city.

28:15.720 --> 28:19.780
Marvin explained in plain words that they cared more

28:19.780 --> 28:22.540
for the money than for their missing son.

28:22.540 --> 28:25.420
Realizing the extent of their miscalculation,

28:25.420 --> 28:28.660
the officers began to switch blame to Rosemary.

28:28.660 --> 28:31.380
Marvin became increasingly agitated

28:31.380 --> 28:35.340
as John recalled the money had been in the woman's hand

28:35.340 --> 28:40.280
but she let it go for the promise of this strange gun.

28:40.280 --> 28:44.020
Marvin revealed they had orchestrated the killing

28:44.020 --> 28:48.780
of Ferguson Beans through Keith's niece, Francis Beans.

28:48.780 --> 28:52.940
Glass congratulated him on finishing the job so effectively.

28:52.940 --> 28:56.780
Francis herself emerged from the darkness behind the desk

28:56.780 --> 29:00.360
and flipped her uncle, Double Birds, as a third figure

29:00.360 --> 29:03.700
with spiky white hair and a long white lab coat

29:03.700 --> 29:06.120
joined the glass retinue.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.940
This mad scientist stood tall behind Francis Beans

29:09.940 --> 29:13.860
and slowly tapped long, wobbly fingers

29:13.860 --> 29:17.340
against her protege's collarbones.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.480
John and Keith doubled down on their denial

29:19.480 --> 29:21.700
of all these events but as the women backed

29:21.740 --> 29:24.420
into the darkness, Keith stepped forward

29:24.420 --> 29:26.540
and asked for his money.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.940
Marvin told him he would receive his winnings

29:28.940 --> 29:31.940
if he was able to prove himself worthy.

29:31.940 --> 29:33.860
Marvin offered John support

29:33.860 --> 29:36.820
if he could prove himself capable.

29:36.820 --> 29:40.380
They then apologized to Clark for having to be in the room

29:40.380 --> 29:44.700
which began to fill with a noxious gas.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.900
Clark ran to the elevator but failed to pry it open.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.720
John asked Keith point blank if he had sold them out

29:50.760 --> 29:53.620
and Keith denied it before passing out.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.520
The officers woke in separate cages

29:58.520 --> 30:01.480
to the sounds of a jubilant crowd.

30:01.480 --> 30:06.400
The cages hung from the ceiling of a smoky, dimly lit room.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.920
Three other cages were present populated

30:08.920 --> 30:13.160
by a muscled stranger, a malnourished child

30:13.160 --> 30:16.960
and Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.880
Below, the audience indulged in vices

30:20.880 --> 30:24.880
and crowded the middle of the room on couches, cushions,

30:24.880 --> 30:28.040
piles of blankets, a papasan chair.

30:28.040 --> 30:32.520
The sinners eagerly watched two teenagers fight

30:32.520 --> 30:37.020
in a plexiglass cage hanging over the center of the space.

30:37.020 --> 30:40.080
The crowd cheered as one teen began

30:40.080 --> 30:44.160
to viciously beat the other, spraying those below

30:44.160 --> 30:46.360
with blood through holes

30:46.360 --> 30:50.000
in the elevated fighting box's floor.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.040
Keith checked his underwear to see

30:53.040 --> 30:56.240
if his tiny gun had been seized.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.560
Thankfully for all of them, it had not.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.360
The winner of the bloody fight stumbled to his feet

31:03.360 --> 31:05.720
and tried to run back to his cage which had locked

31:05.720 --> 31:09.720
into place on the side of the hanging plexiglass room

31:09.720 --> 31:12.120
but he slipped on the blood of the beaten boy

31:12.160 --> 31:15.600
and panicked as the ceiling began to lower.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.720
The weakened champion boy scraped and crawled

31:18.720 --> 31:22.720
just quickly enough to slide into his cube of metal bars

31:22.720 --> 31:27.160
as the ersatz ceiling closed in on the perforated floor

31:27.160 --> 31:31.800
eliciting a guttural moan from the deceased,

31:31.800 --> 31:35.640
crushed, juiced boy.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.480
The blood rained down onto the gaudy

31:38.480 --> 31:40.400
and deranged crowd below.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.440
Many held their mouths open and tongues out.

31:44.440 --> 31:48.560
The two cages attached to the plexiglass combat cage closed

31:48.560 --> 31:51.480
and withdrew through an exit in the wall,

31:51.480 --> 31:54.200
taking the winner of the fight with them.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.840
The officers did some quick math

31:55.840 --> 31:58.280
and realized their turn would come soon.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.000
Keith had indeed located his tiny powerful gun

32:01.000 --> 32:03.160
in his briefs and he called over to Doug

32:03.160 --> 32:06.080
to confirm the man was still suggestible.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.160
As a precautionary measure, they told him losing

32:09.160 --> 32:11.960
would allow him to wake up from the nightmare

32:11.960 --> 32:14.480
he believed he was experiencing.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.240
As retribution for the current state of affairs,

32:17.240 --> 32:20.080
John attempted to urinate on the audience

32:20.080 --> 32:23.360
but slipped and fell on his own penis.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.960
A few members of the audience happily bathed

32:25.960 --> 32:28.320
in the bloody urine he emitted.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.400
Clark Bishop scanned the crowd

32:30.400 --> 32:32.960
and noticed several important figures

32:32.960 --> 32:35.320
including the mayor, the chief of police

32:35.320 --> 32:38.120
and the district attorney of the city.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.680
Keith looked for a host or leader of the event

32:40.680 --> 32:44.640
and spotted at the bar a lone black clad figure

32:44.640 --> 32:47.560
who sported a mustache and medical scars

32:47.560 --> 32:49.440
on his forehead and neck.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.000
The man seemed to be watching over the event

32:52.000 --> 32:54.440
rather than partaking.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.520
As Clark rechecked his cage, it began to move

32:57.520 --> 33:01.560
along the conveyor and toward the plexiglass room.

33:01.560 --> 33:05.440
The cage of the malnourished boy followed suit.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.880
As the cages locked onto the combat chamber,

33:08.640 --> 33:10.560
their doors opened and a buzzer sounded,

33:10.560 --> 33:15.160
eliciting a new wave of cheering from the audience.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.240
The child, not older than 12, slowly crawled

33:18.240 --> 33:20.560
from the cage and stood.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.080
He began to beat his chest and scream.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.160
Clark called down through the plexiglass

33:26.160 --> 33:28.600
trying to convince someone in the crowd

33:28.600 --> 33:30.800
to put an end to the fight.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.800
Clark's failure to rally the audience

33:32.800 --> 33:35.600
saw him caught off guard when the boy flung himself

33:35.640 --> 33:38.720
across the room and kicked the officer's head.

33:38.720 --> 33:41.040
The kick sent Clark into a rage

33:41.040 --> 33:43.280
and he turned on the malnourished boy.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.560
The two began to grapple but Clark easily

33:45.560 --> 33:47.520
gained an advantage on the small child

33:47.520 --> 33:49.840
pressing him into the floor of the room.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.520
The boy's eyes widened as he saw the ceiling

33:52.520 --> 33:54.480
of the cage begin to descend.

33:54.480 --> 33:58.240
Clark bashed the boy's head against the plexiglass

33:58.240 --> 34:00.840
hoping to render him unconscious.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.640
When the boy finally went under, Officer Bishop stood

34:03.640 --> 34:05.600
and began to proclaim his innocence

34:05.600 --> 34:08.080
seeing as the boy had attacked first.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.400
The crowd laughed as the ceiling closed in on the two.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.600
Clark grabbed the boy and dragged him

34:13.600 --> 34:15.840
across the room toward his cage.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.080
As soon as Clark crossed the threshold with the boy,

34:18.080 --> 34:21.880
the cage electrified and the officer's skin cooked.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.640
But when Officer Bishop pushed the boy back out

34:24.640 --> 34:27.800
under the looming human garlic press,

34:27.800 --> 34:30.080
the electrical current terminated.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.160
The boy's body was pressed through the holes

34:33.520 --> 34:35.320
in the bottom of the combat room,

34:35.320 --> 34:39.520
the pulp of which rained down on the crowd below.

34:39.520 --> 34:42.960
Clark's cage disengaged and headed away

34:42.960 --> 34:46.680
but seemed to jam and stopped just short at the dark exit.

34:46.680 --> 34:49.320
50 yards away, the two other officers noticed

34:49.320 --> 34:52.600
the word mayhem tattooed on the back of the muscled man

34:52.600 --> 34:57.200
who then introduced himself as Oz Mayhem Wolf.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.960
Oz couldn't locate Marvin in the crowd

34:59.960 --> 35:02.920
but revealed the man in black was Kevin.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.960
Marvin's head of security.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.520
John asked Oz if a large amount of money

35:07.520 --> 35:09.600
might persuade Marvin to free them

35:09.600 --> 35:12.200
and Oz scoffed at the idea.

35:12.200 --> 35:16.080
People in their situation were for sport, not work.

35:16.080 --> 35:19.960
Oz explained the fights in the den of sin were easy.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.440
Keith considered his chances against a man like Oz

35:23.440 --> 35:25.400
and began to weep.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.480
He attempted to trigger the door release

35:27.480 --> 35:30.120
just as the cage began to move.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.200
Keith's skin burned as his cage locked

35:33.200 --> 35:37.440
against the plexiglass wall and John Lee Pettymore's cage

35:37.440 --> 35:40.160
locked into the other side of the room.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.760
The two men surveyed each other across the blood pool

35:43.760 --> 35:46.400
that once made up a child.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.940
Keith reached into his underwear,

35:47.940 --> 35:50.680
grasping his tiny but powerful gun

35:50.680 --> 35:51.960
and the men worked together,

35:51.960 --> 35:55.880
Keith blasting the floor and John stomping on the cracks.

35:55.880 --> 35:59.520
When stray shots killed denizens of the den of sin,

35:59.520 --> 36:02.600
others rushed in to lap up their blood.

36:02.600 --> 36:06.940
It took three jumps to bust through the perforated circle

36:06.940 --> 36:11.040
of plexiglass floor and the two officers landed directly

36:11.040 --> 36:14.280
on a man in a papasan, crushing him.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.160
The crowd went wild.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.640
Some attempted to flee while others basked

36:18.640 --> 36:20.180
in the violent scene.

36:20.180 --> 36:23.240
Keith fired toward the bar but missed Kevin,

36:23.240 --> 36:25.940
obliterating the barkeep instead.

36:25.940 --> 36:29.080
In a rage, John flew at the nearest attendee,

36:29.600 --> 36:32.760
a man with a curly mustache and a flowing ascot.

36:32.760 --> 36:37.760
He screamed into the throng while Clark spat from above.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.280
The crowd quickly dissipated, leaving a small group

36:41.280 --> 36:44.960
of people obsessively drinking and snorting the blood

36:44.960 --> 36:46.000
on the ground.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.680
Kevin also remained.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.960
The man hadn't moved from his place at the bar.

36:50.960 --> 36:54.240
Keith tried to tackle this mysterious head of security

36:54.240 --> 36:58.320
but Kevin caught him midair and slammed Officer Vigna's head

36:58.400 --> 37:02.440
into the bar, leaving him limp and unconscious.

37:02.440 --> 37:06.160
As Clark shook his cage above, John rushed to Keith

37:06.160 --> 37:08.560
and grabbed the tiny gun from his hands.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.000
Looking into Kevin's eyes, John felt as though

37:12.000 --> 37:16.160
he recognized this man but couldn't quite place him.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.600
Kevin's dead stare seemed to flicker

37:18.600 --> 37:20.520
with the same acknowledgement.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.200
And John seized the moment to fire a couple rounds

37:23.200 --> 37:24.040
at the man.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.200
He missed and Kevin broke for the door,

37:26.200 --> 37:29.760
leaving John to nurse his penis amidst the carnage.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.440
As the last of the crowd ran from the room,

37:32.440 --> 37:35.160
Clark's cell broke from the ceiling.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.480
The door opened as it struck the floor

37:37.480 --> 37:40.840
but Clark was pierced by one of the cage's bars

37:40.840 --> 37:44.520
and his body came to rest, listless at the bottom

37:44.520 --> 37:45.460
of the cage.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
John Lee Pettymore IV found himself the sole surviving cop

37:51.000 --> 37:53.880
from contention here in the Den of Sin.

37:53.880 --> 37:57.720
Two creepy twins were still in the den trying to sneak out

37:57.720 --> 38:00.440
but John caught them and found out they designed

38:00.440 --> 38:03.320
the security system here in Marvin's lair.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.120
John tried to bargain with them to escort him out

38:06.120 --> 38:09.200
with limited success so he shot one in the knee.

38:09.200 --> 38:13.400
Fearful, the twins swore to pay John $5 million

38:13.400 --> 38:15.680
in exchange for their lives.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.560
This was interrupted by a voice near Clark Bishop's

38:18.560 --> 38:20.360
shish kebabed corpse.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.960
John looked over and saw a hunched man wearing

38:22.960 --> 38:27.280
an old tattered robe with a hood that covered his face.

38:27.280 --> 38:30.760
The voice was crackly and muttering something ancient

38:30.760 --> 38:31.960
and jaunty.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.840
A bright light began to form under the hood

38:34.840 --> 38:37.720
that was obfuscating this being's face.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.160
As it reached its hands into the light,

38:40.160 --> 38:44.000
the hood was drawn back and this old man ripped

38:44.000 --> 38:48.240
an unnaturally bright light out of his familiar face.

38:48.240 --> 38:52.160
This much older Clark Bishop took his beaming hands,

38:52.160 --> 38:54.960
reached deep into the chest of the unconscious

38:54.960 --> 38:59.240
Clark Bishop, yanked the bar from his younger self's chest

38:59.240 --> 39:03.240
and threw his limp former body over his older

39:03.240 --> 39:04.640
cloaked shoulder.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.840
The two Clark Bishops, old and dead respectively,

39:07.840 --> 39:11.480
then disappeared in a ball of light.

39:11.480 --> 39:15.120
The off-putting brothers, Rich and Richard Nichols,

39:15.120 --> 39:18.360
told John Lee Pettymore IV that John Peters

39:18.360 --> 39:20.960
had tried to big time it at the den.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.760
Apparently he had posted online about these visions

39:24.760 --> 39:26.760
he saw while in a coma.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.240
When he came out of the coma, he was visited by an agent,

39:30.240 --> 39:34.320
Victor, who told him about a mind probing device

39:34.320 --> 39:36.720
being used by ISIS.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.560
John shot Richard Nichols in the other knee

39:39.560 --> 39:42.760
and then he finished the job and put old Dick Nichols

39:42.760 --> 39:45.320
out of his pleasurable misery.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.960
Rich began drinking his brother's blood

39:47.960 --> 39:50.280
before John forced him out of the den

39:50.320 --> 39:52.320
into a long hallway where they found

39:52.320 --> 39:55.280
the individual rooming quarters of Rosemary,

39:55.280 --> 39:58.280
Kevin, Charles and Francis.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.560
Rosemary had a framed picture of germane glass

40:01.560 --> 40:03.560
hidden under her pillow.

40:03.560 --> 40:06.640
On the photo of the slender, muscular man

40:06.640 --> 40:09.440
with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms

40:09.440 --> 40:12.080
going down to his hands and fingertips,

40:12.080 --> 40:15.560
there was a sharpied heart around this man's face,

40:15.560 --> 40:18.080
which was stoic, almost blank.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.840
Kevin had a Spartan room with a desk,

40:20.840 --> 40:22.960
bed and a chest of drawers.

40:22.960 --> 40:27.960
Under the desk, he had carved repeatedly, not Kevin.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.200
In between the mattress and box spring, there was a notepad.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.200
On every page, it said,

40:35.200 --> 40:38.160
I had the same dream again last night.

40:38.160 --> 40:43.160
She just says, I'm so sorry, he's just so beautiful.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.600
You don't have to do this, we can leave, we can run.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.120
Carved repeatedly inside the chest of drawers

40:51.120 --> 40:54.920
was the phrase, Mary in the woods.

40:56.240 --> 40:59.520
Charles was doing extensive research on contention,

40:59.520 --> 41:02.040
including the Piston Pig Farm.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.280
A draft email on his computer revealed

41:04.280 --> 41:07.600
that he and Rosemary had run into Tilde B

41:07.600 --> 41:09.920
in possession of the gun.

41:09.920 --> 41:12.280
Francis's room was a complete wreck,

41:12.280 --> 41:14.160
but was covered in advanced,

41:14.160 --> 41:17.320
seemingly impossible mathematical equations.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.160
There was also a small drawing of one of the small spheres.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.240
As John and Rich began to leave the dorm area,

41:24.240 --> 41:27.120
they noticed four figures in brown uniforms

41:27.120 --> 41:29.040
with fishhook sides,

41:29.040 --> 41:32.720
dragging the body of Keith Vigna down the hallway

41:32.720 --> 41:34.400
into an elevator.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.440
Continuing the search across the hallway

41:36.440 --> 41:38.720
in a room lined with file cabinets,

41:38.720 --> 41:42.000
John Lee Pettymore IV found his own file.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.960
He learned that he was adopted by John Lee Pettymore III

41:45.960 --> 41:48.240
from Cole's orphanage.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.760
The next file he found was Kevin's.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.720
There was a picture attached.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.560
Missing the surgical scars

41:55.560 --> 41:59.120
and looking much younger and happier than Kevin,

41:59.120 --> 42:02.720
the hollow shell of a man working for Marvin Glass,

42:02.720 --> 42:07.680
John recognized his father, John Lee Pettymore III.

42:07.680 --> 42:11.760
The file revealed that an unknown, alias Kyle,

42:11.760 --> 42:14.120
Anne Love, alias Karen,

42:14.120 --> 42:17.920
and John Lee Pettymore III, alias Kevin,

42:17.920 --> 42:21.200
were once a team called K-Cell.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.600
Marvin Glass caught Kevin and Kyle,

42:23.600 --> 42:26.240
but Karen was able to escape.

42:26.240 --> 42:30.760
Marvin supernaturally forced Kevin to kill Kyle.

42:30.760 --> 42:34.760
Glass was after information on how the sphere worked.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.080
John also came across a file named Satan

42:38.080 --> 42:40.880
with a picture of a disturbing-looking woman

42:40.880 --> 42:44.280
with a mouth that not only took up half of her face,

42:44.280 --> 42:47.160
it showed an amount of unbridled pleasure

42:47.160 --> 42:49.640
he could barely comprehend.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.800
Kevin, the empty vessel that was once John's father,

42:52.800 --> 42:54.800
found the snooping pair

42:54.800 --> 42:57.880
and began emptying clips into the room.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.800
John IV sacrificed Rich Nichols to Kevin's withering fire

43:01.800 --> 43:04.160
before attempting to face down his father

43:04.160 --> 43:06.960
with Keith's small but powerful pistol.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.160
John winged Kevin, revealing mechanical components

43:10.200 --> 43:12.320
below his skin, but to no avail,

43:12.320 --> 43:15.880
as John Lee Pettymore IV was immediately mowed down

43:15.880 --> 43:18.120
by his own adopted father.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.160
And then the world was dark for John,

43:21.160 --> 43:24.800
but he still felt very much alive.

43:24.800 --> 43:29.680
He was moving, like Gogurt busting out of a plastic tube

43:29.680 --> 43:30.920
by pressure alone.

43:30.920 --> 43:35.840
He felt himself squeeze out of a dark constricting space

43:35.840 --> 43:40.280
onto the cold, hard floor, and he began rolling.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.840
His limbs extended from his form

43:42.840 --> 43:45.400
and slammed into the file cabinet walls

43:45.400 --> 43:46.840
on either side of him.

43:46.840 --> 43:49.560
It gave John, or whatever John now was,

43:49.560 --> 43:53.560
the leverage he needed to fling his silver round frame

43:53.560 --> 43:54.800
at his target.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.640
As he landed down on Kevin,

43:56.640 --> 43:59.360
one of his appendages sliced into the soft tissue

43:59.360 --> 44:01.240
on the back of his prey's neck.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.520
Another snapped Kevin's head forward,

44:03.520 --> 44:05.800
and John could feel the fracture

44:06.640 --> 44:09.400
as a third reached in, gripped the top of the spine,

44:09.400 --> 44:11.880
and ripped the entire spinal cord

44:11.880 --> 44:16.160
out of John Lee Pettymore III's body in one swift motion,

44:16.160 --> 44:21.160
promptly forcing itself into the then vacant spinal column

44:21.600 --> 44:24.080
of this human being.

44:24.080 --> 44:26.840
Keith Vigna, unconscious, perhaps dead,

44:26.840 --> 44:30.640
saw himself violently holding a pillow over someone's face

44:30.640 --> 44:35.120
when the pillow itself transformed into an oily black ooze,

44:35.120 --> 44:38.480
and it washed over the face below it, not of a person,

44:38.480 --> 44:40.840
but the face of the watch his father, William,

44:40.840 --> 44:44.080
gave his brother, Ferguson, so many years ago.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.720
Looking down at his wrist, he was wearing this watch,

44:46.720 --> 44:49.760
but when he looked up, he didn't recognize the world.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.720
Dust clouds settled to reveal a horse

44:52.720 --> 44:56.040
pulling a wagon through a small frontier town,

44:56.040 --> 44:59.280
and the bald man Keith knew as Billy Harrison,

44:59.280 --> 45:02.320
the one who took Keith's uniform and gun in the clinic,

45:02.320 --> 45:04.480
he was walking in Keith's direction,

45:04.480 --> 45:05.800
and he kept repeating,

45:05.800 --> 45:08.800
I did everything that you asked me to do, Officer Vigna.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.800
Holding up the strange looking camera

45:10.800 --> 45:13.880
Officer Pettymore found in the car of Julie Maxwell,

45:13.880 --> 45:16.080
Harrison took a picture of Vigna.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.840
The light was blinding, and as it faded,

45:18.840 --> 45:22.720
Keith was standing in darkness, dank and chilly.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.520
Right in front of Keith was a massive tank

45:25.520 --> 45:30.120
filled with the now eerily too familiar opaque ooze.

45:30.120 --> 45:32.600
Keith pressed his face against the tank

45:32.640 --> 45:35.040
to see something creeping toward him,

45:35.040 --> 45:39.000
and as the face of Tildy B. Mitchell came into focus,

45:39.000 --> 45:41.720
Keith stood in an open field,

45:41.720 --> 45:44.640
the dead grass covered in a thin freeze

45:44.640 --> 45:48.760
crunching under his feet as he approached a metal hatch,

45:48.760 --> 45:52.520
but water, gross murky water with bits of grass and sludge

45:52.520 --> 45:56.680
began spewing from the creases of this metal hatch.

45:56.680 --> 46:00.720
The water began to flood this field at an alarming pace.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.640
Keith looked down and saw his reflection

46:02.640 --> 46:06.560
in the rippling water, but something looked off.

46:06.560 --> 46:10.640
Keith came to in a strange room on an operating table.

46:10.640 --> 46:14.240
The room was lined with jars of organs and body parts

46:14.240 --> 46:18.920
as well as tubes that ran to vats filled with fish.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.680
The tall mad scientist with spiky white hair

46:21.680 --> 46:24.960
woke up a dude with brown hair and frosted tips

46:24.960 --> 46:28.360
wearing frat boy clothes and a puka shell necklace.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.280
His name was Bread.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.600
The scientist clicked a button and both Keith

46:32.600 --> 46:35.640
and the fratty Bread felt an intense pain

46:35.640 --> 46:37.360
through their entire bodies.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.320
She clicked the button again and the pain was gone.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.840
Suddenly, a fish head with a small human body

46:43.840 --> 46:46.240
popped out of Bread's pocket.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.360
The little fish fella was curious about the world.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.440
Both he and Bread had never left the room

46:51.440 --> 46:53.440
and they were really hoping Keith could help them

46:53.440 --> 46:54.960
venture into the beyond.

46:54.960 --> 46:58.160
Keith promised the two experiments he would take them

46:58.160 --> 47:00.400
to Las Vegas if they could help him.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.920
Just then, Keith's niece, Frances, came into the room.

47:03.920 --> 47:07.640
She showed Keith a mirror to reveal surgical scars

47:07.640 --> 47:10.960
across his brow, down his nose, past his lip

47:10.960 --> 47:13.080
and onto his collarbone.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.360
There were also scars from the tip of his finger

47:16.360 --> 47:18.120
up to his elbow.

47:18.120 --> 47:21.720
She explained they had brought him back to life

47:21.720 --> 47:23.680
with a few upgrades.

47:23.680 --> 47:26.680
He had a supply of cocaine in his forearm

47:26.680 --> 47:28.680
which could be shot out of his index finger

47:28.680 --> 47:32.160
into his new metal nose, a nose capable of handling

47:32.160 --> 47:35.800
as much cocaine as his internal organs could muster.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.960
He also lost his ability to empathize with humanity,

47:38.960 --> 47:41.400
something brand new to Keith Vigna,

47:41.400 --> 47:43.920
the now partially mechanical man.

47:43.920 --> 47:47.600
Keith named the little fishman Peter Dieter.

47:47.600 --> 47:50.000
After Frances left the room, Bread and Peter

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
freed Keith from his restraints.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.920
Keith, only in his surgery gown, threw on Bread's

47:55.920 --> 47:58.800
extra clothes, a too tight orange polo,

47:58.800 --> 48:01.760
teal shorts that were three sizes too big

48:01.760 --> 48:04.800
and a pair of Sperrys and put Peter Dieter

48:04.800 --> 48:05.760
up on his shoulder.

48:05.760 --> 48:08.320
They all left the room and as they tried to find the exit,

48:08.320 --> 48:11.040
they happened upon a black marble hallway

48:11.040 --> 48:14.280
with a massive door at the end and four guards

48:14.280 --> 48:17.040
with scythes shaped like fish hooks.

48:17.040 --> 48:20.440
The guards looked like fish people, like Peter,

48:20.440 --> 48:22.760
but fully grown, human sized.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.560
As Keith, Bread and Peter bailed,

48:25.560 --> 48:27.080
Frances intercepted the group

48:27.080 --> 48:29.720
and took them to see Marvin Glass.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.560
They walked back into that black marble hallway,

48:32.560 --> 48:36.120
through the enormous door at the end and into a room

48:36.120 --> 48:37.920
the size of a basketball court.

48:37.920 --> 48:41.200
One wall was made entirely of glass,

48:41.200 --> 48:44.800
which looked into a murky aquarium.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.120
Marvin stood there, looking into the water

48:47.120 --> 48:51.560
before he turned around to face the chai fraps.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.200
Frances clicked a button on a small remote

48:54.200 --> 48:57.560
and everyone in the frappe frat was paralyzed.

48:57.560 --> 49:01.520
With a clear upper hand, Marvin offered Keith a deal.

49:01.520 --> 49:05.080
He would give the new metal vigna the $1 million earned

49:05.080 --> 49:07.840
by killing Ferguson if Keith will do

49:07.840 --> 49:10.280
just one more thing for Marvin.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.400
To show the former police officer, current android,

49:13.400 --> 49:16.760
how serious he was, Marvin grabbed Peter,

49:16.760 --> 49:20.960
walked back over to the unfathomably massive aquarium

49:20.960 --> 49:24.560
and reached unnaturally through the glass.

49:24.560 --> 49:27.680
He placed Peter Dieter into the murky water

49:27.680 --> 49:32.680
and pulled his gaunt spindly arm back into his dry office.

49:32.960 --> 49:36.320
Some sort of giant fish monster in the aquarium

49:36.320 --> 49:39.880
swam by and swallowed Peter Dieter

49:39.880 --> 49:42.240
as everyone in the room watched.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.600
Marvin then set his sights on Bread.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.440
He took the frat boy apart piece by piece

49:47.440 --> 49:51.880
until the problematic robotic boy could no longer function.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.440
Then Marvin Glass assigned the new Keith vigna

49:54.440 --> 49:56.120
to his next task.

49:56.120 --> 49:59.320
In order to prove Keith's loyalty and pay his debt,

49:59.320 --> 50:02.440
Keith must go to the Manstein funeral

50:02.440 --> 50:07.440
and bring back Stan Manstein, Ari's father, for questioning.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.200
Keith agreed.

50:09.200 --> 50:12.000
A thick fog obfuscated Clark's vision.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.240
The air, like gravity, felt stronger than normal

50:15.280 --> 50:17.480
and the whisper of a familiar voice

50:17.480 --> 50:19.960
sent a shiver down his spine.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.320
Clark sensed a sudden drop in temperature

50:22.320 --> 50:24.520
as a stainless steel door appeared

50:24.520 --> 50:26.120
and it opened in front of him.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.760
Behind, a woman began to scream.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.720
When he turned around, he was greeted by the face

50:30.720 --> 50:33.760
of Tildy B. Mitchell on a television screen.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.200
In a shaky voice, she began repeating herself

50:36.200 --> 50:41.200
over and over, bonus round, bonus round, bonus round.

50:42.240 --> 50:44.400
Suddenly, Clark was running down the street,

50:44.400 --> 50:46.320
the street on which he lived.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.080
He noted a familiar boy about to enter the house

50:49.080 --> 50:50.080
on the left.

50:50.080 --> 50:54.400
Clark tried to scream, but the fog veiled him once again.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.960
His screams echoed infinitely into the endlessness

50:57.960 --> 50:59.280
that engulfed him.

50:59.280 --> 51:02.140
Then, a new voice reached him and he looked up

51:02.140 --> 51:06.320
to see the face of his once mentor, Gerald Fingerson.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.800
It had been some time since the two had seen each other,

51:08.800 --> 51:11.320
but Gerald had aged with grace.

51:11.320 --> 51:14.120
It was December 6th, a crisp winter morning

51:14.680 --> 51:16.480
and Clark was dressed only in briefs

51:16.480 --> 51:19.800
and a pump and dump branded t-shirt.

51:19.800 --> 51:22.960
Clark wore no shoes or socks and despite the cold

51:22.960 --> 51:25.680
and the recent events, the man felt amazing,

51:25.680 --> 51:27.360
the best he'd felt in a long time.

51:27.360 --> 51:29.480
A string was wrapped around Clark's wrist

51:29.480 --> 51:33.460
and attached to a bag of ice from which protruded a rod.

51:33.460 --> 51:36.260
The bag of ice leaked red liquid down the driveway

51:36.260 --> 51:37.480
on which the two men stood,

51:37.480 --> 51:40.280
centered in a suburban neighborhood.

51:40.320 --> 51:44.360
Clark noted the name Jim Cook on the mailbox nearby.

51:44.360 --> 51:47.680
Gerald didn't know how Clark had come to be in the driveway.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.320
He discovered him there as the officer

51:49.320 --> 51:50.900
regained consciousness.

51:50.900 --> 51:53.760
Clark hastily recalled the events in the Den of Sin,

51:53.760 --> 51:56.000
none of which were familiar to Gerald.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.760
Opening the bag of ice, Clark recognized the bar

51:58.760 --> 52:01.560
was pulled from a cage in the Den of Sin.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.840
As he checked himself for wounds that might account

52:03.840 --> 52:05.800
for the blood, Clark pulled up his shirt

52:05.800 --> 52:09.760
to reveal a gaping hole where his heart should be,

52:09.760 --> 52:12.320
lined with skin and cartilage.

52:12.320 --> 52:17.280
He was rightfully shaken, despite feeling physically well.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.680
Gerald declined to touch Clark's body hole

52:19.680 --> 52:21.620
and suggested they step inside the house

52:21.620 --> 52:23.400
where he'd planned to share a dinner

52:23.400 --> 52:26.200
of cashew chicken with Jim Cook.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.760
Clark had to inform Gerald

52:27.760 --> 52:30.600
that Jim had been found dead in an alley.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.600
Clark and Gerald decided it would be wise

52:32.600 --> 52:34.720
to leave the street and made their way

52:34.720 --> 52:37.360
into the unlocked Cook residence.

52:37.360 --> 52:39.520
The house was older but cozy.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.920
Papers and binders were strewn across the living room,

52:42.920 --> 52:46.200
covering every surface and stagnant dust

52:46.200 --> 52:48.200
hung in the light from the window.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.960
Clark made his way to the bedroom

52:49.960 --> 52:52.200
and donned a pair of Jim Cook's pants,

52:52.200 --> 52:54.320
several sizes too small.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.880
Back downstairs, Clark noticed a picture

52:56.880 --> 52:59.320
of his parents on the fridge.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.920
They were posed in silly hats with Jim Cook

53:01.920 --> 53:04.520
who smiled begrudgingly long.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.480
His investigation further discovered

53:06.480 --> 53:08.920
a bullet-torn tarot card.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.840
The major arcana card, the devil,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.720
and a taxidermied baby squirrel

53:13.720 --> 53:16.680
bagged and placed in a chest of drawers.

53:16.680 --> 53:20.160
Behind the couch, Clark noticed an empty holster.

53:20.160 --> 53:24.480
The words, scientia morse est, were tooled into the leather.

53:24.480 --> 53:28.560
Below that was a dash and an uppercase K.

53:28.560 --> 53:32.240
In the bathroom, Clark found a smooth silver ring

53:32.240 --> 53:34.240
with a plateau on top.

53:34.240 --> 53:36.960
Two books stood out among the papers in the living room.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.080
The leather cover of the thicker tome

53:39.080 --> 53:41.600
was embossed with a familiar symbol,

53:41.600 --> 53:44.880
a large circle surrounded by six smaller circles,

53:44.880 --> 53:48.120
and the other was a thin, red notebook.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.280
It seemed vaguely familiar.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.280
Clark opened the leather tome

53:52.280 --> 53:54.520
where a girthy wooden bookmark

53:54.520 --> 53:56.360
had been placed near the back.

53:56.360 --> 53:59.600
Written over and over on the ancient parchment

53:59.600 --> 54:00.720
was the phrase,

54:00.720 --> 54:05.680
it is only through death that he may rise again.

54:05.680 --> 54:07.800
Drawn over the obsessive scrawling

54:07.800 --> 54:10.200
was a hooded figure with brilliant light

54:10.200 --> 54:12.200
shining from its maw.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.760
The book closed with supernatural force

54:14.760 --> 54:16.680
as Clark tried to flip forward

54:16.680 --> 54:20.120
and an envelope fluttered out from between its pages.

54:20.120 --> 54:24.280
Inside the envelope was a letter signed by Jim Cook.

54:24.280 --> 54:27.400
Jim seemed to be refuting something called

54:27.400 --> 54:30.400
the revelation of the overseer,

54:30.400 --> 54:33.400
calling it the scratches of a broken man.

54:33.400 --> 54:37.280
The letter went on to outline a set of new guidelines,

54:37.280 --> 54:39.320
including the immediate reassignment

54:39.320 --> 54:43.080
of all members of the disposal unit.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.880
The circle symbol was present at the top of the letter

54:45.880 --> 54:47.960
and it was accompanied by the creed,

54:47.960 --> 54:52.160
faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

54:52.160 --> 54:55.840
The clicking hammer of a cocked gun startled Clark.

54:55.840 --> 54:57.560
He raised his hands in the air,

54:57.560 --> 55:00.600
dripping blood from the ice bag.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.200
Chief Maggie Cook spoke behind him,

55:03.200 --> 55:05.480
leveling her pistol at his back.

55:06.400 --> 55:10.640
Clark, what the hell are you doing in my daddy's house?

55:10.640 --> 55:12.600
Tears formed in Clark's eyes

55:12.600 --> 55:15.080
as he and Maggie lowered their arms.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.000
Gerald halfheartedly stood between the two

55:18.000 --> 55:21.360
as Clark explained that he thought Maggie was dead.

55:21.360 --> 55:24.040
The former chief also confessed an amount of confusion

55:24.040 --> 55:27.640
and the two awkwardly sandwiched Gerald in a hug.

55:27.680 --> 55:31.080
Clark told Maggie he'd seen the charred remains of her body

55:31.080 --> 55:33.080
and he withdrew from the embrace.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.640
The woman was dressed in a dark hoodie and jeans

55:35.640 --> 55:37.240
and it marked the first time Clark

55:37.240 --> 55:39.760
had ever seen her out of uniform.

55:39.760 --> 55:43.480
She brushed by him to retrieve the red notebook.

55:43.480 --> 55:45.440
Maggie was unsure of what to make

55:45.440 --> 55:47.920
of Clark's presence in her father's home.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.200
He explained he had gaps in his memory

55:50.200 --> 55:52.080
and Maggie prodded Clark's chest

55:52.080 --> 55:54.200
where the tunnel had formed.

55:54.200 --> 55:57.560
She gasped as Clark lifted his shirt.

55:57.560 --> 56:01.320
Immediately excited, she insisted Clark follow her,

56:01.320 --> 56:03.040
that she'd been waiting a long time

56:03.040 --> 56:04.560
for these events to occur.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.280
Gerald interjected claiming

56:06.280 --> 56:08.920
that Maggie had always been a bitch

56:08.920 --> 56:11.760
and Maggie asked if Clark was all right.

56:11.760 --> 56:16.760
He began to realize Maggie couldn't see Gerald Ferguson.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.120
Gerald's voice became echoey

56:19.120 --> 56:21.280
as he frantically tried to convince Clark

56:21.280 --> 56:23.560
that Maggie was not to be trusted.

56:23.560 --> 56:26.440
Addressing Maggie, he insinuated that Clark knew

56:26.440 --> 56:29.880
what was at the mill before Clark approached the old man,

56:29.880 --> 56:33.160
reaching out to his librarian mentor.

56:33.160 --> 56:37.040
As they grasped hands, Clark felt nothing but air.

56:38.280 --> 56:40.200
Gerald Ferguson dissipated.

56:41.080 --> 56:45.080
Clark, are you with me?

56:45.080 --> 56:45.920
Are you here?

56:46.920 --> 56:49.840
Clark turned solemnly back to Maggie.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.120
Before they got to work,

56:51.120 --> 56:53.960
Clark suggested he fill his bag with more ice,

56:53.960 --> 56:56.440
fearing it contained what had been scraped out

56:56.440 --> 56:58.920
to form the tunnel in his chest.

56:58.920 --> 57:01.360
Maggie investigated and found a heart

57:01.360 --> 57:04.200
impaled on the bottom of the metal rod.

57:04.200 --> 57:06.240
Clark emptied Jim's ice trays

57:06.240 --> 57:08.800
before joining Maggie in her silver Camry

57:08.800 --> 57:13.600
for a ride out to the mill on the other side of the city.

57:13.600 --> 57:17.680
Clark used the silent drive to examine the canvas bag

57:17.680 --> 57:19.920
next to the human heart in the ice.

57:19.920 --> 57:24.920
The bag contained tiles with the letters S-T-L-E-N-R

57:26.840 --> 57:30.880
and a symbol, a circle inside a square.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.640
Clark quickly determined those are the letters

57:33.640 --> 57:36.000
given at the beginning of the bonus round

57:36.000 --> 57:37.440
of Wheel of Fortune.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.360
Clark broke the silence in the car

57:39.360 --> 57:42.320
when he asked Maggie why she was still alive.

57:42.320 --> 57:44.680
She answered by explaining that the leather tome

57:44.680 --> 57:47.400
in her dad's house contained a prophecy,

57:47.400 --> 57:50.800
the revelation of the overseer.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.600
The Circle of Knowledge believed the overseer

57:53.600 --> 57:56.160
was coming to set an order in the world

57:56.160 --> 57:59.080
and they prepared the way and protected the world

57:59.080 --> 58:01.320
from unnatural forces.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.320
Maggie had been skeptical,

58:03.320 --> 58:05.000
but she claimed to be coming around

58:05.000 --> 58:07.680
to an understanding of the forces at play.

58:07.680 --> 58:11.120
She believes fire and fear kept the world safe,

58:11.120 --> 58:13.040
that most people couldn't handle the knowledge

58:13.040 --> 58:16.080
of the supernatural, but that people like her and Clark

58:16.080 --> 58:18.880
and the Circle of Knowledge had been tasked

58:18.880 --> 58:22.320
with a responsibility to keep the world moving.

58:22.320 --> 58:24.600
Clark admitted to having met Leon Simpson

58:24.600 --> 58:27.320
and broke down as he tried to explain the horrors

58:27.320 --> 58:30.160
the officers had experienced in her absence.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.760
When Clark asked Maggie why she wasn't there,

58:32.760 --> 58:35.800
she asked in turn if the ant questions

58:35.800 --> 58:38.440
when it's being moved by a boot.

58:38.440 --> 58:41.560
She alluded to the idea that much larger things

58:41.560 --> 58:44.760
were at work than what Clark had seen so far.

58:44.760 --> 58:46.240
They lapsed into silence again

58:46.240 --> 58:49.920
as the Camry pulled onto a country road outside of town,

58:49.920 --> 58:52.800
passing through a verdant tunnel of trees

58:52.800 --> 58:54.320
on the way to the mill.

58:54.320 --> 58:56.000
A few miles later, they arrived

58:56.000 --> 59:00.480
at the massive brick building with two enormous smokestacks.

59:00.480 --> 59:03.480
The mill on the other side of the city

59:03.480 --> 59:05.000
was filled with people,

59:05.000 --> 59:07.840
none of whom paid any mind to Clark's current dress

59:07.840 --> 59:10.680
or the blood dripping from the ice bag he carried.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.080
Clark recognized no one.

59:13.080 --> 59:15.400
Maggie led them through a secure door in the back

59:15.400 --> 59:18.680
and down a spiraling stone staircase.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.640
Clark recognized the room at the bottom,

59:20.640 --> 59:23.560
circular with six stone slabs.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.640
Each slab held two bodies

59:25.640 --> 59:29.080
and a xenonimatode was attached to each body.

59:29.080 --> 59:33.040
The unconscious figures were covered in open sores

59:33.040 --> 59:37.320
from previous placements and their skin was rotted.

59:37.320 --> 59:41.000
Maggie led Clark to the center and chuckled grimly,

59:41.040 --> 59:44.720
asking Clark to lie down on the middle slab.

59:44.720 --> 59:45.880
Clark was reluctant,

59:45.880 --> 59:48.720
remembering that Leon had said he would need to sacrifice

59:48.720 --> 59:50.640
neither flesh nor limb.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.080
Maggie agreed, mostly,

59:52.080 --> 59:54.960
but suggested a little flesh was necessary

59:54.960 --> 59:57.120
now that the game had changed.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.240
Clark called for Leon,

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.480
but Maggie told them they'd been sent away.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.640
She grabbed his shoulders and repeated the creed,

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.960
faith through knowledge.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.520
It's just called knowledge.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.960
She claimed Clark needed knowledge

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.480
and pressed on his chest

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.040
before moving down to his left foot, still bare.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.800
Maggie twisted a circular handle at the base of the slab

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.720
and pulled up a cartridge the size of a parking pylon.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.760
Inside the cartridge was a xenonimatode

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.200
and with a swift motion,

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.880
Maggie pulled it out and placed it on Clark's foot.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.200
Clark's vision immediately darkened.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.560
Suddenly, the ground he stood on was made of light.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.320
Clark felt absolute contentment in this new world,

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.600
but noted he was otherwise surrounded by absolute darkness.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.080
12 figures were clear in the distance,

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.040
as was a giant black mass,

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.120
all dimly lit from below.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.000
The 12 appeared to be following the massive being

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.200
as they walked away from Clark.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.600
When Clark moved closer,

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.080
he began to hear their chanting.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.320
Ahead of them stood a towering beast,

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.640
its shoulders 25 feet from the ground.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.000
As Clark stared, its image seemed to form and reform,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.720
changing and glitching and it roared

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.320
and Clark fell to the ground

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.000
and began to weep uncontrollably.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.160
Clark came to in the mill on the other side of the city

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.920
as Maggie returned the xenonimatode back into the ground.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.080
Clark, that thing's coming and we keep it from coming here.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.880
Clark was shaken and he stammered over questions

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.360
about what he had just witnessed.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.320
He asked if there's anything Maggie could do

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.360
about the heart.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.440
She lifted it from the bag by the rod,

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.240
slowly sliding the organ from the metal.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.680
Maggie held the heart in one hand

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.080
as it began to sputter blood.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.840
She calmed Clark and retrieved a small wooden stick

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.680
from the corner.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.560
She ran the stick through the hollow rod

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.600
and caught two small pieces of metal

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.560
that emerged from the other end.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.120
Maggie reminded Clark of their backup plan

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.240
from the last job and noted he hadn't come back in time.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.080
The circle of knowledge had already tried

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.360
to take his heart once and yet he still stood.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.280
Maggie meditated on the fact that things move stranger

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.200
in the world than most thought possible.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.200
She gave Clark his first job,

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.960
refusing to answer further questions.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.360
The job would take Clark to Ari's funeral

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.160
at the city cemetery.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.600
Maggie admitted to being shaken by the woman's death

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.040
but it presented an opportunity to be in the same place

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.920
as Stan Manstein who rarely left the city asylum.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.200
Clark's job was to assassinate Stan

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.800
at his daughter's funeral.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.520
Clark was initially horrified

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.560
but he remembered the unspeakable entity

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.120
waiting to break into this world,

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.960
steeled himself and requested a firearm.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.520
John Lee Pettymore IV stood in front of a storage unit

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.600
with a large yellow symbol on the door.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.520
It was the logo of the circle of knowledge,

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.720
six circles surrounding a larger circle.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.920
Inside, he found a wooded territory

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.760
and he was suddenly holding one of the silver balls.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.200
It gave off a comforting warmth.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.160
Looking out, he saw a sky of endless darkness

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.960
under which two children held hands.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.560
John's senses began to be overwhelmed

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.600
by the sounds of torment that filled his ears.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.360
And then he woke up in the room with the filing cabinets

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.880
where he had been shot repeatedly by his own father

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.400
and John was confronted with the sight of his own body

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.960
dead on the ground.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.600
Inspecting his reflection,

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.400
he saw he was now in his father's former frame.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.280
John decided to covertly remain Kevin

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.200
for as long as he could.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.360
Rosemary called for Kevin to join her

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.640
and John Lee Pettymore IV followed in his new body,

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.200
though he largely failed in his attempts

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.440
to extract any intelligence.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.000
At the end of a black marble hallway,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.560
jumpsuited fishmen guarded Marvin's massive,

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.760
strange office door.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.840
Marvin greeted them, Rosemary and Kevin,

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.240
and announced they were moving into the final phase

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.920
of contentions demolition.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.800
A small silver sphere sat on a tripod atop Marvin's desk

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.840
and an intense light show glinted out

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.760
from the room behind him.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.400
Marvin ordered Rosemary and Kevin to go to the funeral

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.440
of Ari Manstein, the contention police officer,

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.760
to ensure that the new Charles, Keith Vigna,

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.200
was successful in his mission to apprehend Stan Manstein.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.480
As they headed out into the city,

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.640
John Lee Kevinmore witnessed a rowdy band of revelers

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.720
using dirty dog grooming loyalty cards

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.600
to enter a grate that took them underground.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.720
Keith left the glass compound and headed to the funeral

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.520
of Ari Manstein and his police cruiser.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.400
The strange gun and camera with glass tubes

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.400
were no longer in this car.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.960
On his phone, he found multiple missed calls from Drew,

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.800
as well as a voicemail that said the mass is growing

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.120
and pleaded for the officers to stay far away

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.280
from contention.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.760
He sounded panicked and the call ended abruptly.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.200
Keith chose to not change out of his tight orange polo

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.880
and big coral shorts and boat shoes.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.520
In the city cemetery, the smell of a crawfish boil

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.440
wafted through the above ground mausoleums

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.360
and directed Vigna to the funeral,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.680
where he spoke briefly to Ari's mother

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.520
and took a seat in the front row.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.840
Clark came to on the concrete slab

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.680
in the middle of the underground dungeon room

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:53.120
below the mill on the other side of the city.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.680
Maggie Cook backed away quickly

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.680
as she lowered the Xenon nematode back into the ground.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.880
Maggie moved on, told Clark that after he completed

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.960
his mission of killing Stan Manstein

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.360
at Ari Manstein's funeral,

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.600
he was free to do whatever he pleased.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.040
She offered to house him back

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.720
at the circle of knowledge if he wanted.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.200
This job won't be daily.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.960
At first, she said, but they would get him trained up

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.160
and working more often eventually.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.520
Clark pressed her on it not being daily.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.800
He was shaken by the thing he saw in his vision

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.600
and wanted to stop it immediately.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.720
She was glad to see Clark's fire.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.320
She said that's exactly what they need in the organization.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.040
Maggie gave Clark a burner phone, a gun,

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.640
an old contention police uniform,

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.920
and a silver Honda Accord.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.320
She'd be in contact with him the next day, December 7th.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:45.840
Clark stopped for gas on the way to Ari's funeral.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.400
While he was busy pumping,

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.680
a woman stealthily dropped a phone

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.920
into his car passenger seat.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.200
Phone was scrubbed clean,

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.120
save a single text message that read,

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:59.680
do you wanna know why your parents were killed?

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.720
Clark immediately texted back, who is this?

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.960
Clark arrived at the city cemetery

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.600
and followed his nose to a small clearing

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.040
where a funeral service was set up for Ari Manstein.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.240
Ari's mother, Jan, greeted visitors in the front.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.320
Sat up there by the crawfish boil was Keith Vigna

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.440
wearing Sperry boat shoes, big coral blue shorts,

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.800
and a tight orange polo.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.440
From Clark's distance, Keith looked healthy.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.680
Clark, however, last remembered seeing Keith fucking die.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.000
Then again, Clark seemingly came back from the dead himself,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.640
so maybe it wasn't that surprising.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.920
Clark didn't see Stan or John Lee Pettymore.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.240
Leaning casually against a mausoleum,

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.200
he tried to inconspicuously hide in the back of the crowd.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.880
While Rosemary drove John Lee Pettymore IV

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.120
and the body of his father, John Lee Pettymore III,

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.120
whom she knew as Kevin, to the cemetery,

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.040
Rosemary revealed the news of Charles' death shook her

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.000
as she thought the enhancements made them more robust.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.160
Kevin reflected on the truth.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.920
Everything dies.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.760
They made their way through the raised

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.240
New Orleans-style tombs to the funeral

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.120
where they found a large crawfish boil.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.120
John saw Keith sitting in the front row

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.400
in a ridiculous outfit and Clark near the back

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.880
in an old-fashioned contention PD uniform.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.420
John split away from Rosemary, approached Clark from behind,

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:29.320
and muttered, bubblegum tree.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:32.960
Recognizing the body of Kevin, Clark was apprehensive

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.000
but tentatively responded, bubblegum tree.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.480
John Lee Kevinmore said nothing

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.680
and faded back into the crowd.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:44.440
Jan Manstein settled behind the podium,

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.280
thanked everyone for coming,

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.800
and introduced her ex-husband,

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.420
who doesn't get out very often.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.960
Stan Manstein, dressed in all white,

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.780
his hair and beard both long and tangled,

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:57.760
his face weathered like leather,

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.520
approached the microphone flanked

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.920
by three heavily armed guards

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.520
with various scars across their faces.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.080
And then Stan began to speak

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.320
in a fully nonsensical language, but through the noise,

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.120
the three officers heard Stan in perfect English

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.400
as time itself began to slow down.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.400
My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.680
She was those things when she was a police officer.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.520
She was those things when she was a school teacher.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.720
She was those things when she was a historian.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.800
You see, one long time ago, when this land was stolen

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.080
and pioneer towns began to form,

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.200
Silas Cole was a miner in the mine

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.860
that employed the town nearby of contention.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.800
While down in the mines,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.500
Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:57.460
and he became obsessed with studying it.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.220
The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.300
Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities,

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.020
he became an inventor and made so much money

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:10.140
off of his inventions that he bought the mine.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.180
He built an office on the top floor

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.580
of the tall, skinny mining company building

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.340
that sat right above the mine itself.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.540
He began to harvest the residue

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.140
and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.860
He invented wild, magical things.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.780
Each new invention brought him wealth and power,

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.440
but also released more of this inky substance into the town.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.700
To divert his raising paranoia,

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.860
he began looking for a partner.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.180
He found a similarly intelligent engineer

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.740
in his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see the substance

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.980
they began calling residue.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.700
But Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.780
He became paranoid that other people could see the residue

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.300
that was loose all over the town.

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.360
Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him,

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.620
so he began kidnapping people he suspected knew too much.

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.780
As Stan spoke, Clark surveyed the crowd,

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.860
slowed around him as he moved at normal speed.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.920
The guards looked slowed as well.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.580
Clark made his way to the front.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.500
John moved into a position behind Stan.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.580
Keith made eye contact with Clark and they bubblegum treed.

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:22.140
Clark saw Keith's fresh scars running from his elbow

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.700
down to the tip of his finger,

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.520
as well as across his forehead down his face.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.740
It didn't seem like the crowd was able

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:30.940
to understand Stan's speech,

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.180
but the three armed guards started to converge on Manstein,

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:37.420
though they moved in slow motion.

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.620
Following his orders,

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.380
Clark drew his gun and shot Stan in the chest.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.460
Time immediately resumed back to normal pace.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.860
John Lee Kevin Moore emerged from behind the stage

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.300
and began firing at one of the armed guards.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.480
The crowd dispersed, panicked.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.380
Keith joined in firing at the guards

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:56.540
with his small, powerful gun.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:59.580
Three gunshots rang out from an unseen location,

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.540
finishing off one of the scar-faced,

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.900
black tactical gear-clad guards.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.320
Another guard tried to fire off his wire arm,

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.060
like the android that attacked them

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.580
at James the Millworker's house,

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.500
but this time the massive man

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.020
accidentally hogtied himself.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.320
John executed the other robot man

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.960
and Keith shoved his fingers into Stan's bullet wounds

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.380
to plug the leaks,

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.320
which jolted Stan back to consciousness.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.040
The restrained robot guard fired at Clark,

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.560
putting bullets in his chest and arm.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.040
Stan mustered the strength to continue his speech

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.720
and time began to slow once again.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.680
The town was suspicious of the disappearances,

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.880
but most of the ones gone were bad people,

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.680
the whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty,

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.800
the piano player, there was a few gamblers,

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.400
the town drunk, so they kept their heads down

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.160
and went about their business.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.160
But then some good people disappeared,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.420
a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.040
the homesteader's wife.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.160
Then the preacher disappeared, the town freaked out

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.640
and they hired a roaming cowboy named Cornelius Beams

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.520
to kill their weird, paranoid figurehead.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.800
Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.480
Neither was Cornelius Beams.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.280
That was the history of contention,

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.560
when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or Ben,

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.360
but her name is Ari forever now

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.840
and our history is different.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.520
Mine is now definite.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.960
Upon finishing his speech, Stan's body seemed

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.080
to instantly turn itself inside out

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.520
and blip out of existence.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:47.840
Clark lost his shit and charged the hogtied guard

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.760
who had shot him.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.560
Clark unloaded his entire clip into this man's head

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.840
while screaming.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.220
Metallic clangs and buzzes clanged and buzzed,

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:00.380
sparks sparkled and wires spilled out

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.280
of the robot guard's head.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.960
The crowd had made a run for it

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:06.040
and the three officers stood in silence

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.900
over the three massacred metal man bodies

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.820
next to the crawfish boil in the casket.

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.820
Keith made sure Ari's body was actually in the coffin.

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:15.740
It was.

01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:18.240
Unsure of each other due to Kevin's presence,

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.940
Keith's scars and Clark's dated uniform,

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:24.440
the three men held each other at gunpoint.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.000
Bubble gum tree.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.380
They lowered their guns.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.540
Keith admitted Kevin killed him,

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:32.120
but he owed Kevin's organization,

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.800
the Glass family, for his life.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.060
Kevin asked Clark to speak to him alone

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:38.980
for a moment without Keith.

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:42.040
Keith went and occupied himself with the crawfish pot.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.980
Kevin explained he used to be John Lee Pettymore IV.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.820
John Lee Pettymore was more of a state of mind.

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.780
Turned out John's daddy was lobotomized

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.280
and had been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.140
When John died, it seemed he was some kind

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.860
of alien squid being or something.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:05.240
He sucked out of John's brain and entered his dad's body.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.500
Clark tried to clarify the squid being part.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.900
Kevin said he didn't really know.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.360
Maybe he was just mechanical.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:16.040
He just knew he left John's body and entered Kevin's body,

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.400
the body of John Lee Pettymore III.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.700
John Lee Kevinmore urged Clark to ask him something

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.340
only John would know.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.460
Clark asked him about the little twins

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.540
they lost to the goo in the suburbs,

01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.660
and John confirmed the story.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.600
As they embraced, Clark whispered into John's ear,

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.520
Maggie's alive.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.880
Kevin didn't believe him

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.260
and proposed that the chief was dead,

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:42.920
but that there were other versions of each of them.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.920
Kevin explained he saw Clark broken and shattered

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.960
on the ground back in the Den of Sin,

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.160
but an older Clark came by, whispered some shit

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.160
over the body, and the two disappeared in a flash of light.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.920
Clark lifted his shirt and showed John the hole

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.560
through his chest where his heart should have been.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.400
Clark told John about waking up with his own heart

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.640
in a bag and running into Maggie.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.200
He said he was now working for the Circle of Knowledge

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.940
and that Maggie and Jim Cook were both also involved.

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.560
Clark asked if John knew how Keith survived.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.320
John had seen some figures with funny-shaped sides

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.280
drag Keith's body away.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.840
Marvin Glass told John they'd turned Keith

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.600
into the new Charles.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.960
The Glass family performed some sort of upgrade procedure

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.600
on all of their cronies.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.560
Clark asked if John was medley now.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.320
Through his bullet holes, they could both see

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.040
metal lining in the layers of flesh.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.040
The two looked back at Keith to see him dipping his hand

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.400
straight into the boiling pot of crawfish.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.320
John walked up to Keith and whispered in his ear,

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.920
I know what you did to my smokies,

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.420
and punched him in the gut.

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.760
Keith realized Kevin was John and gave him a hug.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.840
A big smile spread across Keith's face.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.160
John stopped him and explained he had learned

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.880
this was all some kind of business play for Marvin Glass.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.300
Marvin wanted to demolish contention

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.980
so he could have the land.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:10.480
They've got to save the town.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.480
Clark shared it may be bigger than just the town.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.880
He recounted the vision he saw, barely keeping it together.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.400
Clark explained the Circle of Knowledge is a group

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.580
he worked for now that tried to keep the thing he saw

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.440
in the vision from becoming a reality.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.560
Part of that mission apparently included

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.400
killing Stan Manstein.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.120
That really fucked Keith over.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.320
The Glass family rebuilt him and tasked him

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.420
with bringing Stan back alive.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:41.980
Additionally, Drew had been calling Keith to tell him

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.280
to get the hell away from contention.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.220
Unfortunate because Clark had planned on grabbing his guns

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:50.200
and things from his house and moving shop up to the mill

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.000
on the other side of the city.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.560
Keith mused that he hoped the helmet and radio

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.180
were still in the evidence room

01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:58.280
at the contention police department.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.840
They realized the gun and the camera

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.380
now likely belonged to Marvin Glass.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.440
John thought about it, put his hands up to his head

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.440
and his eyes went white as he looked elsewhere.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.640
John, as your eyes roll backward, your vision goes dark.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.960
Images begin flashing through your mind,

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.820
just snippets, moments, and you try to keep up

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.120
as the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.240
You see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.720
You see the sign for Bean's Pond,

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.260
the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:36.480
in contention.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.900
You see a television.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.320
It's blinking with different letters on it.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.320
R-S-T-L-N-E.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.560
You see a small clearing in the woods.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.520
The ground is scorched.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.180
In a dark room lit by various electronics and machines,

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:56.340
you see a massive, shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall,

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.940
with silvery arms extending from either side.

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:04.020
A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.700
The machine begins whirring,

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.560
and you see a small metal sphere,

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.220
roughly one inch in diameter,

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.020
begin moving up through the tubing

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.940
into the larger armed version of itself.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.020
As this happens, a vast circle opens up in the ceiling

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:22.260
and a disorienting amount of light and sound

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:26.540
pours into this room, revealing text painted on the back wall

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:30.420
that says the same thing you hear violently chanted

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:35.420
by an unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.320
The scene changes again,

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.940
and you see Marvin Glass standing at his desk

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.340
in the grand room you recently stood in as Kevin,

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.300
alongside Rosemary.

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.460
Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.740
closely inspecting it, tapping its lit red luminaire.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:57.260
On his desk are two file folders splayed open

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.640
entitled Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna,

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.760
contention police officers.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:06.020
You can see in Keith's file are various clippings

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.700
about the Beans family,

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:11.140
the tragic accidental deaths of William and Lena,

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.380
Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:15.580
by Ferguson.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.300
In Clark's file, there's a newspaper article

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:22.100
about the murderer who killed Clark Bishop's parents

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.580
and love.

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:27.920
There's a mugshot of a woman smiling a cold, vacant smile

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:31.900
behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes.

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:35.020
And written in Sharpie underneath the mugshot,

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:38.300
it says in all caps, Karen.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.100
In the mid morning sunlight,

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.060
in the wake of a funeral gone horribly awry,

01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:47.000
Keith and Clark watched John's eyes,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.360
which had rolled into the back of his head,

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.800
returned to normal.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.880
John believed he'd developed the second sight

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.360
in his transition from John to Kevin,

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.400
or perhaps he'd had it all along.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.460
He relayed everything he saw sans the planet juggernaut bit.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.640
Keith recalled his brother's watch was in his safe

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.240
at Hotel Motel.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.120
When Keith had put on the watch,

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.440
he felt like he was on some alternate plane

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.680
and knew he needed to take it off.

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:17.600
Clark asked Keith if it was as though the ground

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.120
were made of light.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:21.560
No, it was more like in his mind,

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.680
he was seeing different stuff.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.040
It was hard to decipher what was real and what wasn't.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.480
John asked if Bean's pond meant anything to anyone.

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.080
When he thought about the objects,

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.080
those were the things he saw.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.680
Clark made the connection that the letters John saw

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.200
flashing on the TV are the letters they give you

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:42.200
for the final puzzle in Wheel of Fortune.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:44.280
When Clark woke up with the hole,

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.960
he had a bag with him.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.200
In the bag was what he thought was his heart

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.520
and next to that was another bag

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.200
that had those letters in it.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.680
John informed them they are not the first group of three

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.040
to try to combat this kind of stuff.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.080
Before John, Clark, and Keith,

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.680
there was a group called K-Cell.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.120
Kevin, John Lee Pettymore IV's adopted father

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.880
who he now inhabited the body of,

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.240
a man named Kyle, unknown,

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:18.040
and a woman called Karen, also known as Anne Love.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.000
John told Clark he knew Anne Love

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.840
had been the one to kill his parents.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.760
He didn't know why,

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.760
but Marvin Glass turned the group against itself

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.800
and Karen was the only one to get away.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.520
Marvin made Kevin shoot Kyle.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.080
He was looking for the metal sphere

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.520
and he apparently already had one in his possession.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.840
Everyone wants these spheres.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:45.480
John had one when he arrived at the Glass family compound.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:49.080
Marvin Glass had one and he wanted to collect more

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.640
and learn how they work.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.760
They realized the one John had

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.000
was now likely in the possession of Marvin Glass.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.720
In John's vision, he had just seen one of those spheres,

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:03.120
but it was massive, gargantuan.

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.520
It had arms and a little tube coming out of the bottom

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.360
and up that tube he saw one of the small spheres go.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.560
A huge light opened in the ceiling

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.160
like it was opening to allow this thing to come through

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.120
and the wall behind it read, Planet Juggernaut,

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.960
like the bedding stubs they found

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.760
in John Peter's house and storage unit.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:26.400
Keith remembered that when he had the watch on,

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.920
it clouded his thoughts

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.360
and made him feel like he was going insane,

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.320
but one of the feelings he had

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.040
was wet dirt and grass on his fingers

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:39.360
and he saw a metal door slightly buried that read,

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.920
here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure,

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.560
saviors of the world.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.480
Keith was positive somewhere along the beans bloodline

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.600
was something he didn't know.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:57.200
Clark reminded Keith it was someone related to Keith

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.040
that came in and solved the town's Silas

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.920
and Mary Cole problem back in the day.

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.880
Keith didn't know where Cornelius beans fit in

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.200
with his family being scientists

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.840
and he didn't know where to find that metal door,

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.760
but he felt the door was real

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.560
and maybe there's something inside it they needed to find.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.640
One of the last things Clark remembered

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.400
was being in Glass's office

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.800
and it sounded an awful lot like Glass hired Keith

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.720
to kill his own brother, Ferguson Beans.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.080
Keith had even asked where the money was.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.720
Since they're all working together again,

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.720
Keith didn't see the point in hiding it from them anymore.

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.280
Keith didn't know it was Marvin Glass hiring him to do it.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.240
He was approached by his niece.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.520
Keith explained that he'd hated his brother Fergie

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.160
since they were little boys.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.120
So when this opportunity arose, he jumped at it.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.000
The agents, Kennedy, McKinley and Harrison

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.720
had tasked them with quote neutralizing the threat

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.600
and they were supposed to call a phone number.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.560
It'd been about 48 hours since they'd seen the agents

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.360
and the agents had given them a 48 hour deadline

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.200
so it'd be right about now that they'd be receiving a call

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.040
back at the contention police department.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.840
Keith tried giving Drew a call

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.960
but it went straight to voicemail.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.840
John pointed out the Glass family

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.160
might think Keith is still one of them

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.200
and they definitely think Kevin John

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.960
is still one of them as well.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.240
And while Keith may have failed at his mission

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:28.280
of bringing Stan Manstein back,

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.040
he wouldn't have to infiltrate the Glass building.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.840
He could return under the guise

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.720
of bringing in the guy who killed Stan Manstein,

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.000
that being Clark.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.800
Then all three of them would be inside if things go awry.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.240
The plan was to Chewbacca Clark

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.800
and use that farce to get close enough to kill Marvin Glass.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.240
They decided to call the number the agents left them

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.000
on the way to the Glass family compound.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.400
Suddenly, with an erupting shriek,

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.880
a massive creature materialized

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.200
on top of a nearby mausoleum.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.520
It was a six and a half or seven foot tall creature

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.440
with long limbs wearing a black suit

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.040
over its gaunt frame covered in translucent skin.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.240
This thing looked Clark Bishop in the eyes

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.720
and screeched, hello subject one, five, two, two, five,

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.920
one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight,

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.080
please add me the book, please.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.160
The figure stared and stuck out

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.800
one of its overtly long arms.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.600
Clark's gun was immediately trained on the mysterious figure.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.760
John reached out a hand in greeting from 20 feet away.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.280
The creature's arm was long, but not that long.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.160
Keith ran behind the closest mausoleum and hid

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.880
as he pulled out his gun.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.080
Clark felt an internal struggle, but managed to overcome it

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.280
and he continued to hold his gun steady at the creature.

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.600
Please, I would not like to ask again,

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.960
please give me the book.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:00.520
Clark didn't know what book the creature was talking about.

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:05.520
The thing asked Kevin Lee John Pettimore the Thirth his name.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.080
Kevin John responded in truth that his name was Kevin John

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.720
and that it was a long story.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.960
He asked the creature its name.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.160
The creature said its name was four, three, six, two, nine

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.280
and reiterated it was therefore the book.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.760
Kevin Lee Pettimore the Thirth said again

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.800
that none of them knew which book it was talking about.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.360
The creature claimed it could feel the book was nearby.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.400
Clark looked around for Keith and noticed him

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.880
behind the mausoleum just as Keith took a shot at the creature

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.920
with his small powerful gun.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:41.880
The bullet blasted through the creature's arm, but as it did,

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.040
the arm merely dissipated and began to slowly reform.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.120
Before Keith could smell the smoke from his gunshot,

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.120
the creature was standing in front of him

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.360
with a hand on Keith's throat,

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:58.000
holding him up against the outside of the mausoleum.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.720
It was as if they had all been standing still

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.720
as the creature walked casually towards him,

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.120
but it moved at an impossible speed.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.120
It was probably like what the crowd saw them doing earlier

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.680
during Stan's speech at the funeral.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.920
It asked Keith his name as it continued holding him

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.160
by the neck and Keith responded immediately with his name

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.000
without ever making the decision to do so.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.520
He answered the creature's next questions too.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.800
He was here for the funeral

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.920
and he was shooting because he was scared.

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.880
The thing slowly placed Keith back on the ground

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:37.040
and commanded that he not be scared.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.000
And with that, Keith wasn't scared.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.920
The creature told them it was only there for one thing

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.720
and it would leave as soon as it had the book.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.440
John told Clark to give it the book.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.320
Clark stuttered and stammered nervously

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.000
insisting he didn't know what book it wanted,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.320
he did not have a book

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.280
and all he had were the clothes on his back and a gun.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.880
The creature looked around frantically,

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.600
muttered to itself and began freaking out,

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.160
unable to understand why Clark didn't have the book.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:10.120
Keith searched Ari's coffin for a book.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.840
All he found was Ari's corpse

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.760
and all he achieved was upsetting

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.680
the already confused old lady

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.920
who had been left there on her own,

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.680
unable to leave the funeral quickly in her wheelchair.

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.040
Clark asked the creature to describe the book

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.480
but the creature only responded

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.720
that it was necessary for it to take the book from him

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.720
because Clark's time with the book had come to an end.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.560
They did not want him using the book any further.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.800
The creature insisted the book was there

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.560
and it needed to bring it back.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.600
Keith started shooting the thing again,

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:44.200
it dissipated fully into smoke and ceased to be there.

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:46.520
Keith lost his shit and attacked Clark,

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:48.200
paranoid and afraid.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.760
They eventually calmed him down

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:52.160
with smooth words and quick slaps.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.120
When he snapped out of it,

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.080
Keith wondered aloud if that thing

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.560
reminded them of Marvin Glass.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.880
Conversations circled back to the book.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.280
Clark mentioned he had previously encountered

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.720
a strange book at Jim Cook's house.

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.960
Jim Cook was in the circle of knowledge

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.400
and Clark had found a particular leather bound book of his

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.160
that was quote, freaky deaky.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.480
He also described this book as quote,

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.040
extremely grimoire-ish and it had the symbol

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.360
of the circle of knowledge on the front.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.840
It was possible that this was the book

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.080
the creature had wanted but he hadn't taken it.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.720
Keith asked if Clark opened this book.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.400
Clark reiterated its freaky deaky nature.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.600
He could only open it to the last page.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.480
It was held shut by some unseen force.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.680
Keith asked if he meant like magnets

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.200
to which Clark agreed.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.840
There on the final page,

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.320
Clark had seen a drawing of a hooded figure

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.240
with light coming out of its mouth.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:52.120
Written over and over and over on top of that

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.520
covering the whole page it read,

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:58.880
it is only through death that he may rise again.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.360
Clark went on and explained it was some kind of sacred text

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.000
within the circle of knowledge.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.760
Something to do with the revelation of the overseer.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.920
Clark thought the overseer was maybe a good guy

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.400
who lays peace on the world or something like that.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.320
John remembered when he saw old Clark,

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.120
he was wearing robes and he and dead Clark

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.440
disappeared into a bright light that came from his mouth.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.040
Keith was confused about what he meant

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.080
by old Clark and dead Clark.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.800
John unhelpfully clarified the Clark

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.400
that brought this Clark back to life.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.240
Keith defended that this was the first

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.400
he was hearing about it and they seemed

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.800
to already know a lot more than he did.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:42.560
All John saw was an older version of Clark show up

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.040
that light came out of his mouth

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.680
and then he reached into regular Clark

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.160
and they both disappeared.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.040
That made total sense to Keith and they all agreed.

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:54.160
John suddenly remembered he'd arrived with Rosemary.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.200
Looking around John didn't see Rosemary

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:00.200
but he did see two city police officers headed their way.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.280
He warned the others they should skedaddle

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.240
but they all kept talking, failed to escape notice

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.160
and were told to freeze.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.120
Clark turned still with gun in hand

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.360
and told the officers everything was fine,

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.000
that they were contention PD.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.480
The city cops said they were responding

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.160
because shots were fired.

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.960
Keith said it was a 21 gun salute

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.440
and called the officers, quote, motherfuckers.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.880
The city officers brought out notebooks to take statements.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.440
Kevin John then approached,

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.760
pulled out a dirty dog grooming loyalty card

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.760
and suggested the officers not bother.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.760
He was with Mr. Glass.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.240
They whispered to one another and quickly apologized.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.040
They started to ask Kevin to apologize

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.560
on their behalf to Mr. Glass

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.400
but quickly changed their minds

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.560
covering the names on their badges

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.640
and turning away before they hoofed it out of there.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.760
John shared that the loyalty card

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.840
opened the door to the den of sin.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:58.880
You know, the place where they were held

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.400
and forced into those cage fights.

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.480
He had seen a bunch of rowdy degenerates

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.120
use theirs to open an entrance in the ground of an alley.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.200
There were still a bunch of Android bodies lying around

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:14.200
and no one had actually put the casket in the tomb.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.400
Together, they picked up the coffin of Ari Manstein.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.920
As they entered the open mausoleum, they heard a voice.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.120
Clark recognized the voice the quickest

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.160
because it sounded so much like his own.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.600
Little sparks of light could be seen in the darkness.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:34.440
They seemed to be ignited by the steady chanting

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.760
which echoed throughout the room.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.960
The flickering light illuminated a piece of parchment

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:43.800
held by an old Clark Bishop wearing a dark cloak

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.520
which covered almost all of his face.

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.800
A light began to emanate from his mouth.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:53.160
The words he chanted ignited lifted from the page

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.640
in front of him and danced in a circle above them.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.280
His lifted hands were cut open

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.200
and bled out onto the floor around them.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.640
John and Clark instinctively dropped their support

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.600
of the coffin leaving Keith as the sole bearer of the wait.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.560
The coffin hit the ground.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:14.080
Ari's corpse plopped limply out

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.840
and onto the blood-soaked floor of the cold and dusty crypt.

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.800
The three of them were surrounded

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.640
by this magically sashaying fire.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.320
It covered them in a warm, somewhat familiar light.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.080
The light should have been comforting

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.720
but Clark was overwhelmed with the urge to leap

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.760
at the older version of himself.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:38.520
He lunged, grabbed two handfuls of an empty cloak

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.960
and smashed his face against the back wall of the mausoleum.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.280
The boys woke up with a shock through their bodies.

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:53.200
It was dark and cold and smelled sweet and savory.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.640
There was a pool of blood.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:57.400
In it rested the body of Ari Manstein

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.960
half hanging out of her broken coffin.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.720
John Lee Kevin Moore was in black tactical gear.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.600
Keith wore a tight orange polo

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.400
with big coral blue shorts and boat shoes.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.040
Clark donned a vintage contention police uniform.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.200
They felt pain on their chests, on their backs

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.560
and on the bottom of their left feet

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.160
and in the palm of their dominant hands.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.160
Branded into each of these body parts were first names.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.240
Their chests each read Marvin.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:29.280
Their backs Drew.

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.720
Their left souls Maggie.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:35.000
And their dominant palms Tildy.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.120
Under the burned name of Maggie

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.960
on the bottom of Clark's left foot,

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.600
the skin had been eaten away in a very particular pattern.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.720
A circle surrounded by six smaller circles.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.760
Clark went mad and rushed John Lee Kevin Moore screaming.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.400
John quickly drew his gun and shot Clark in the leg.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.480
They all agreed on a few things.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.360
They were scared and confused.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.160
They didn't know what the names on their bodies meant

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.400
and they needed to see a doctor.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.480
At the clinic, the officers billed the visit

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.040
to the first church of contention.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.720
On the way to Jim Cook's house,

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.920
Keith called the number Agent Kennedy left behind.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.200
He identified the officers involved,

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.920
disclosed the incursion had not been stopped

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.160
but that the incident had been covered up

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.800
and asked to speak to the FBI officers

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.760
instead of a recording.

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:33.120
In Jim's house, there were papers and binders everywhere.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.440
Clark grabbed the book they had discussed,

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.080
the one with the circle of knowledge logo on it.

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.280
The only page they could open to

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.280
was marked with a girthy wooden bookmark.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.680
The page read,

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.760
it is only through death that he may rise again.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:51.320
Over and over and over behind the image

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:54.880
of a hooded figure with light shining from its mouth.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.240
Clark then revealed an envelope

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.680
containing a letter from Jim Cook.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.840
His letter's intent was to quote,

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.800
refute the revelation of the overseer,

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.280
which it called quote, the scratches of a broken man.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.880
The letter ordered the immediate reassignment

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.800
of all members of the disposal unit.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.840
The header of the letter read,

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.560
faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.080
The other interesting items Clark had found

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.800
included a ring, smooth and silver

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.920
with a little plateau on top.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.600
Keith put the ring on and when slipped on his finger,

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.360
the ring glowed and revealed a familiar symbol,

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:39.680
an M made of four double helices.

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:43.080
Keith made the ring into a necklace with his shoelace

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:44.200
and wore it.

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.520
A drop of vodka hit Clark's nose.

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.640
It dripped from the ceiling above him.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.280
The boys went upstairs but couldn't find a room

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.040
where the vodka drip would have come from.

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.320
Clark put his ear to the wall where that room

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.440
should have been and he heard static.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.640
Unable to find the door to this hidden room,

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.760
Keith kicked a hole through the wall where the room would be.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.520
Keith landed on the other side of the wall,

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:10.080
pushed through by his colleagues and covered in debris.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.240
Inside, they found a small living room setup.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.760
A chair with an end table faced a TV VCR unit

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.120
that set atop a pile of thick books.

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.480
A desk and a chair were pressed up against one wall

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.640
and a handle of vodka had tipped over on the floor nearby.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.600
Its contents soaked the carpet

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.440
that barely covered a makeshift floor.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.640
Clark noted a proper door in this room

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:37.000
that led into the upstairs hallway.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.080
Static played on the television

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:42.400
and illuminated the titles of the tomes underneath,

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.080
textbooks on physics and quantum mechanics.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.120
On the end table sat a small vial of clear liquid,

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:53.040
a scalpel and a box of tissues.

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.000
Keith twisted the top off the vial and wafted it

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.520
into his nose but smelled nothing and suffered no ill effects.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.800
He slipped the vial into one of his spacious pockets.

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.880
The TV VCR unit had no input cable or antenna,

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.880
a tape labeled Bishops WOF was discovered inside the unit.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:16.680
It contained an episode of Wheel of Fortune,

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:18.520
a special couples episode

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:21.120
on which Clark's parents were contestants.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.480
They had just been married

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:25.120
and were hoping to win money for their honeymoon.

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.400
On the desk were three folders and an envelope.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.440
The first folder contained a large stack of papers

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:34.120
regarding Operation Stapler.

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:37.400
The double helix M logo appeared on the second page

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.320
above the word myriad.

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.920
Keith flipped to the index

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:43.840
and gleaned that it was the work of someone

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:47.640
who had been tasked with rewriting an existing program

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:50.360
put in place to create androids.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.880
This respect operation aimed to cut costs

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.320
and sell to private companies.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:00.240
John Googled myriad and the screen briefly wobbled

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.160
before returning to normal with no clear results.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.520
The second folder was entitled Operation Hole Puncher.

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:11.120
The title page included the name and symbol

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.160
of the circle of knowledge.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.360
This folder contained a list of companies,

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:21.360
mostly nonprofits, think tanks, charities and universities.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:26.120
The third folder referred to Operation Three Ring Binder

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.440
and was empty except for a dirty dog grooming key fob

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.200
tucked into the pocket.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.040
Clark's parents did well on the show,

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:36.400
eventually making it to the bonus round.

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.280
As the final puzzle was displayed,

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:41.720
Clark's mom turned to his dad and said,

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:44.240
we were already given the best letters.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:46.920
They solved the final puzzle and won the prize,

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.280
a honeymoon.

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.320
Clark noticed the tape in the VCR showed a great deal

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.840
of wear like it had been played many times.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:58.320
John opened the envelope and found the symbol

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.280
of the circle of knowledge at the top.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.440
It said, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.640
Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.920
that I write to you.

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.840
I fear a change is coming.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:15.680
I cannot be certain, but I suspect there's one among us

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.200
scheming with treacherous intent.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.760
I have recently grown a tail.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:24.320
He is not particularly skilled in going unnoticed.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.640
He is an odd little man with round glasses

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:31.080
on a fat face with no hair and no chin.

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:35.480
He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.080
on Marvin Glass.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:41.840
Stay alert, step carefully, we are being watched.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.040
Signed, Jim Cook.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.440
Several individual letters in this letter

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:50.920
were over or underlined and the men quickly found the name

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.800
Maggie Cook was coded into the message.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:58.200
They inferred Jim thought his daughter might be the traitor

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.640
inside the circle of knowledge.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.400
The officers discussed the order of Jim's letters,

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.440
the connection between Chief Cook and Harold Dorsey,

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.680
the resurrection of Maggie and the lurking horror

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.520
she'd revealed to Clark through the Xenonematode.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.760
The men didn't come to any clear conclusions,

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:19.040
but agreed Marvin Glass was the most addressable threat

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.120
they had.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.040
With that, they resolved to storm the gates

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.320
of the Glass compound using Clark as a false hostage.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.920
On the way, John mentioned the Glass company card

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.600
for Large Eddie's Gun Emporium in Kevin's pocket.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.400
Large Eddie himself kicked open the door to the back

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.920
where he kept all the cool guns.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.960
The renegade officers equipped themselves with a sampler

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.920
of grenades and firearms and drove to the secret entrance

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.760
of the Den of Sin in the heart of the city.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.840
There, as John pulled out the dirty dog grooming

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.200
loyalty key fob, the great gave way beneath the men's feet

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.640
and they plummeted into darkness below.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.960
As they fell downward into darkness,

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.040
the former cops slowed to a feeling of weightlessness

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.280
before being abruptly confronted with a bright light,

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.840
huge words in a spray painted font

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.960
and a deafening voiceover saying the same,

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.320
welcome to the scrap pit.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.880
A video screen showed them an enormous Glass arena

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.360
with hundreds of screaming spectators

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.960
and a shadowy form began to emerge,

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.520
but before this person could even hit the lights

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.960
of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupted into view,

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.600
gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:43.400
The screen faded to black and they found themselves

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.760
in an oily obsidian room with an entrance to the scrap pit

01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:53.160
and a separate door guarded by two fishmen armed with scythes.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.960
On seeing the officers, the guards moved

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.880
to let them through this door.

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:01.800
Keith and John marched Clark through and into an elevator

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.000
as if he were their prisoner.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.880
The elevator door opened

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.080
and they saw five malnourished children

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.480
along with Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, passed out on the floor,

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.280
attended to by grandmotherly old women in identical clothes.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.200
These women poured a liquid into the mouths

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.480
of the unconscious bodies.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.240
Keith and John both saw a ghostly black dog

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:32.320
and red lion diving in and out of the bodies.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320
One of the women entered the elevator

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.840
with our heroes inside and it continued moving.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.280
She introduced herself as Ursula

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.280
and explained her role in preparing the sacrifices.

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.160
The boys exited the elevator into a massive foggy room

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.600
that contained a network of catwalks

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.600
over dark green murky water.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.280
The fishiness was pungent, rusty moss covered chains,

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.400
dangled large hooks between the catwalks

01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.880
and some of these hooks suspended prisoners above the water.

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:10.760
Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:13.480
was one of these unlucky folks.

01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:15.800
When he saw them, he freaked out

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:17.680
at their return from the grave.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:22.080
This entire chamber was seemingly patrolled by one fish man

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.840
and Francis Beanes could be heard questioning

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:29.440
Cathy and George Piston deeper into the cavernous space.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.000
Francis asked Cathy Piston about silver spheres

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.760
as well as the residue and outbreak in contention

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.680
while dipping a clearly distressed George Piston

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.880
slowly into the murky water.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.160
Kevin John got Francis's attention

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:48.960
and told her that they'd brought Clark

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.280
as a prisoner to torture

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.800
and that Marvin wanted to see her right then.

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.960
She was not convinced to leave immediately

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.320
so Keith resorted to his backup plan.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.280
He tried to whack her with his heavy metal hand.

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:03.560
He missed and Francis threw him into the water.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.720
She was about to run for it

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.240
but Kevin John persuaded her to stay

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.400
for more of her beloved torturing.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.120
At that moment, it occurred to Keith

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.960
he might be swimming with the giant creature

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.240
that ate his little fish friend, Peter Dieter.

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.480
Keith freaked out and began to climb up George Piston.

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.080
Erupting up out of the water just under Keith's boat shoes,

01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.760
the massive creature swallowed both Keith and George

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:36.400
and re-submerged into the vast murky pool.

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:39.080
Clark, John, and Francis watched

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.480
as the water began to calm in front of them.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.000
Francis Beans, unaffected by the apparent death

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.640
of her uncle, prepared to hang Clark up for some torturing

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.880
which prompted a failed sneak attack from John.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.440
Francis countered by pushing the hook

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.200
directly through John's shoulder.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.720
Clark kicked her right over the edge into the water

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.880
and she clanged her head on the railing as she went.

01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:06.280
The soon to be corpse of Francis Beans

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.960
floated face down in the water.

01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.560
Keith Bigna and George Piston

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:14.000
were inside an enormous creature.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.320
They tried to claw and push their way out

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.480
as the disgusting, burning ooze inside the beast

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.560
slowly digested them.

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.760
Keith used George Piston as a human shield

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.280
and blasted out of this fish monster's side

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.760
with a frag grenade.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:35.800
While gazing down at the floating body of Francis Beans,

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.000
Clark and John saw a flash of light deep under the water

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.480
followed by bubbles and a gasping Keith of Igna,

01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.440
skin covered in burns.

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:46.640
They pulled him out and Keith broke the news

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.560
of George's death to Kathy in a typically kind

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.400
and sensitive manner, sparing no details.

01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.440
The boys decided to leave Francis Beans to her fate

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:00.600
and continued to question the hanging Kathy Piston

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.480
about why she was supplying people

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.120
to the Circle of Knowledge.

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:06.840
Clark admitted he already knew why

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:09.520
and told Kathy he was working with Maggie.

01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.360
Kathy agreed to help the team take down Marvin Glass

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:15.600
if they just explained where Leo was.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.880
They told her he disappeared from this plane of existence

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.040
and they blamed it on Marvin Glass.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.560
Even though she was awful human trafficking scum,

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:28.520
her crack shot ability was a necessary addition.

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:31.480
John and Keith pulled down the hanging Doug Jacobs

01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.760
in the body of Agent Chad.

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:37.520
Clark discreetly asked Kathy her opinion on Maggie.

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:40.480
She said Jim's daughter was rougher around the edges

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:43.700
than her dad, but Kathy had been too busy at the hospital

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:45.840
to pay too close attention.

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.400
Clark told her the truth about Leo's last hours

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:51.560
and about how he had killed Julie.

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.360
On the metal catwalk above the hazy greenish water stood

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.840
Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV

01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:00.640
in the body of his father, John Lee Pettymore III,

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.780
AKA Kevin, Keith Vigna, Kathy Piston,

01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.960
and Doug Jacobs in the body of Agent Trent Chad.

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:11.160
Their goal, leave this enormous dank prison alive.

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.280
The only exit they could see, a closed elevator door.

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.360
The issue, fishmen in brown jumpsuits

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.040
with mouths full of human teeth and scythes.

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.120
And those human teeth mouths, they were singing.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.040
This song's purpose was revealed

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.040
when the catwalk was dragged down into the water

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.040
by a massive version of the fishmen,

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:50.160
an enormous creature with a huge pus-leaking wound

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:53.840
in its side and a hunger in its eyes.

01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.460
The monster dug into Keith's chest

01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:58.720
and ripped its claws through his skin,

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.000
revealing metal insides.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.420
The pain was too much for Keith Vigna to bear,

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:08.080
and he passed out on the metal walkway.

01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:11.160
Keith, in the darkness you see a woman

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.540
wearing old-timey clothing.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.340
She looks very normal, except for the hole

01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:18.160
right in the middle of her head.

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:21.120
Regardless of how she turns to look, either way,

01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:24.440
you can see right through the middle of her head,

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.320
and she is walking toward you.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.200
As she walks, her clothes change multiple times,

01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:33.540
as if she's in an unnatural fashion show

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:37.000
that's moving forward in time, decade by decade.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.560
She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground,

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:45.440
you see the house of Chief Maggie Cook go up in flames.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.400
You saw this happen in the front yard,

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.400
but this time, right now, you see it from the backyard.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.240
The fire spreads and explodes toward you,

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:56.820
over you, through you, and you turn around

01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:00.840
to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond,

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:04.460
and immediately, the water evaporates.

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.400
Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:11.640
flopping their final flops, you see your brother,

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:15.460
Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground,

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:18.720
wearing a cowboy hat and spurs,

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:21.960
and the watch your father, William, gave him.

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.920
You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:28.680
You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals,

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.520
until the B. Mitchell comes walking up

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:33.520
out of the water toward you,

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:36.800
and darkness fills your vision once more.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.880
Outside of Keith's unconscious dreams,

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:43.620
the fight continued, the water was still murky,

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:46.120
the air was still heavy, the fishman's teeth

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.040
were still unsettling, and the elevator door

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:51.520
had still yet to open.

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:54.160
Bullets whizzed around the enormous prison.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.280
Flash bangs erupted and flashed.

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.900
Doug Jacobs, in the body of Agent Trent Chad,

01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:02.840
was decapitated by the scythe of a fishy humanoid.

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:05.860
Kathy Piston likely saved all of their lives

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:09.220
with her nonstop firearms proficiency.

01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:12.980
Grenades destroyed entire sections of the catwalk,

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:15.180
and persuaded the enormous fish monster

01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:18.220
to dive back down below the surface.

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.380
One of the human-sized bipedal amphibians

01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:26.100
lodged its scythe into the skull of Kathy Piston.

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:29.600
John was swallowed whole by the big daddy fish monster,

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.940
but he swam out through the hole Keith had previously made.

01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.940
He saw another creature make an escape as well,

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:40.400
a little toy-sized human body with the head of a fish.

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:44.220
However, an unseen force suddenly grabbed John

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:47.880
and dragged his body down to the bottom of the tank,

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:51.860
up against the glass of this gargantuan aquarium.

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:55.180
John was forced to stare directly

01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:59.740
into the unblinking eyes of Marvin Glass,

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:03.460
and as John Lee Kevinmore the thirst's lungs

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:08.140
filled with water, Marvin Glass smiled.

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:14.180
Clark stood on a wet, partially destroyed catwalk

01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:17.780
with Keith in his arms with nowhere to escape to

01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:21.300
across from the last standing fishman.

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:24.020
The human amphibian swung wide,

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:27.220
and Clark stabbed it to death with its own scythe.

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:30.860
He saw bubbles in the water before the two halves

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:35.340
of the enormous creature, as well as bits of George Piston,

01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:37.220
floated to the surface.

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.580
Clark broke down in tears as a god

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.760
who had failed his followers.

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:45.700
The elevator arrived.

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.660
Clark dragged the unconscious body of Keith Vigna

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.220
halfway in to block the elevator door

01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:54.500
before going to see if he could find John's corpse.

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:55.740
He did not.

01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.740
In a desperate search for closure,

01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.300
Clark stripped down to his tighty-whities

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:03.340
and took the scythe down into the water with him,

01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:06.460
diving into the disgusting murk.

01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:10.220
At the bottom and side of this massive aquarium,

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.420
he found John Lee Kevinmore the thirst's body

01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:18.140
pressed against the glass by an unseen influence.

01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:20.540
Looking for the source of the force,

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:23.460
he saw Marvin Glass standing in his office

01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.500
on the other side of this glass.

01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:28.760
Marvin shook a picture at Rosemary.

01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.460
Clark couldn't find a pulse and John's body wouldn't budge.

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:34.460
Then he remembered Keith's small

01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.400
but incredibly powerful gun,

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:39.500
swam back up, fetched it from Keith's shorts,

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:42.660
and still, in his soaking wet tighty-whities,

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:46.780
Clark fired into the aquarium wall over and over

01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:50.260
until it broke, sending a tidal wave

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:54.640
of murky green wet into Marvin's office.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.880
However, Marvin calmly lifted himself and Rosemary

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.880
up atop the water and made direct eye contact with Clark.

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.340
With the slightest gesture,

01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:09.920
Marvin then moved the impotently enraged Clark

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.960
down from the catwalk of the adjacent room.

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.960
Helpless and paralyzed, Clark was placed in front of Glass,

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:22.080
compelled to stand motionless on top of the water.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:25.840
Keith woke up in darkness,

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:28.600
jammed halfway into an elevator door.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:30.940
Thankfully, his little friend Peter Dieter was there

01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:35.400
to heal his shredded chest with its weird saliva.

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.780
Keith looked down and saw the scene in Marvin's office.

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:41.640
Marvin looked back but Keith managed to scurry away.

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.600
Unfortunately, Peter was dragged away by Marvin.

01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:48.520
The elevator doors closed and took Keith to a lab

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:52.240
full of computers, math, and electrical shit

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:55.580
with a sort of interrogation window into a side room

01:55:55.580 --> 01:56:00.080
that was completely painted in blood and viscera.

01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:03.360
The tall, awkward, mad scientist was working

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.880
here in the main lab.

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.880
Keith broke the news of Peter Dieter's likely death,

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.720
which bummed her out.

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.440
He explained the scene he saw

01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:15.280
in Marvin's aquarium water-filled office from the elevator.

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:18.480
Poking around this lab, Keith saw a bunch of VHS tapes

01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.520
labeled with names, and he asked to see one.

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:25.120
The scientists obliged, and they watched a malnourished

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:29.160
child in the bloody room stand behind a desk

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:32.260
with a small metal sphere on it.

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:34.160
The child picked up the sphere.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:36.880
The sphere promptly ripped out his spine

01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:40.360
and entered his body, which then began slamming itself

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.240
repeatedly against the wall,

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.560
much to the amusement of the scientist.

01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:47.960
She was very surprised to hear that Keith had seen

01:56:48.440 --> 01:56:50.000
someone handling a sphere.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.600
While they walked down to Marvin's office,

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.240
he told her about the black Nike bag.

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:57.120
When they opened the large, strange obsidian doors

01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:01.080
to Glass's office, water erupted out and into the hallway,

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:03.080
sweeping the two of them away,

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.240
though their bodies were held by Marvin's unnatural ability.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.200
Without effort, they moved through the water,

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.560
into the office, and up to the little meeting

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.080
between Marvin, Rosemary, Peter, and Clark.

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:21.480
Glass held a Polaroid photo and demanded explanation.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.560
It depicted Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna,

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:28.840
alongside Kevin, in a world where everything was made

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:33.840
out of darkness except the ground, which was made of light.

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:37.780
Clark was rendered unable to move

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:41.080
by Marvin Glass's unnatural grasp.

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.100
In his catatonic state, he witnessed an odd discussion

01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.240
between Marvin and Rosemary.

01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:49.440
Marvin showed Rosemary the picture

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.540
and asserted that something was wrong.

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:54.380
You gotta send me over there.

01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:57.340
I don't know how, but we gotta figure out something.

01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:59.020
Suddenly, Marvin perked up.

01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:02.260
He looked up past the former confines of his office

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:05.620
where the elevator door beeped, unable to close

01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:09.180
due to its sensors and Keith Vigna's body.

01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:10.980
Marvin held out his hand.

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:15.540
He seemed confused when a small creature landed in his palm.

01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:18.900
Peter Deeter, with the softball-sized fish head

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:21.620
on a human body the size of a Barbie doll,

01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:25.800
chatted and chatted with Glass, who glared at Rosemary

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.980
while alluding that her job title was in jeopardy

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:31.700
and could be available soon.

01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:34.900
Marvin's face shifted like he smelled something

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:38.540
or experienced some other unknown sensation.

01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:40.740
He reached out again and out of the water

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:45.380
stood Keith Vigna and the white lab coat-clad scientist,

01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:49.300
maniacal hair now dripping, and her eyes lit up

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:52.660
with excitement to see Peter Deeter still intact.

01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:55.100
Keith and the tiny fish-man creature

01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:59.260
greeted each other warmly before Marvin shut him down

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.380
with the flick of a hand.

01:59:01.380 --> 01:59:05.520
Peter's large fish eyes stared blankly past his new friend

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:08.420
as Clark's normal human eyes blinked back

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:11.300
to his unbelievable reality.

01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:14.300
Marvin Glass asked the two former police officers

01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:17.620
about the strange picture and they felt unnaturally

01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:21.020
compelled to answer to the best of their abilities.

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:24.200
The picture came from the camera sitting on Marvin's desk.

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.260
It shows things that aren't there.

01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:28.840
They thought the pictures were from a different dimension

01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.260
or the past or something.

01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:33.500
Marvin asked how many pictures they took.

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:35.160
There was the one with the torches

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.880
in the old-timey clothing,

01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:40.760
one with John Peters and oily black stocks,

01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:43.700
and another of a guy with tribal tattoos

01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.260
kneeling before a cowboy with his hand up

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:48.240
to hide his face from the camera.

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:50.680
Marvin asked Clark to confirm the part

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:52.720
about the man with tribal tattoos

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:56.000
running down both arms to his fingertips.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.080
And Rosemary dove for the gun.

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.160
As she grabbed it, Marvin reached down

02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:03.100
and flung the sphere at her from off the desk.

02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:06.700
Multiple shiny limbs extended from the small sphere

02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:08.900
slammed into the desk for leverage

02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:13.780
and slung its silver round frame at its target, Rosemary.

02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:16.780
One of its appendages sliced into the soft tissue

02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.780
on the back of Rosemary's neck.

02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:20.780
Another snapped her head forward.

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:23.200
A third metal tendril reached in,

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.860
gripped the top of Rosemary's spine

02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:29.820
and ripped her entire spinal cord out of her body

02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:32.140
in one swift motion.

02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.580
This ball promptly forced itself

02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:39.420
into the now-vacant spinal column of this human being.

02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:43.700
The new Rosemary had a crazed look in her eyes.

02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:47.200
She blew her nose into her hand,

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:52.200
slammed the mucus into the empty chamber of this odd gun,

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.700
and without aiming, squeezed the trigger.

02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:57.660
An almost blinding flash of light

02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:00.100
illuminated the entirety of Marvin's

02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:02.500
enormous, flooded office.

02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:05.460
And then, as if she had never been,

02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:07.480
the body of Rosemary was gone.

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:08.820
Aah!

02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.820
Marvin Glass roared in anger.

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:13.860
And where Rosemary just stood,

02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:17.100
they could now see a pool of viscous black sludge

02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:19.820
enveloped a placid body.

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:24.020
Her limbs seemed to peacefully fold into the ooze,

02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.380
becoming one with the sentient mass of goop

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:30.140
that then slid across the water.

02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.780
Marvin reached out a hand, grabbed the goo,

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:36.560
and hurled it downward into the murky water below.

02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.360
And a strange noise filled the air,

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.980
like when a tube TV is turned on,

02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:45.060
a noise that could almost be felt in your head

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.840
or in the back of your throat.

02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:50.780
Marvin pressed the two petrified men

02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:53.220
on their knowledge of this black substance.

02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:54.940
How many times had they seen it?

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.060
Had it taken people?

02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:57.700
Did they know how to contain it?

02:01:57.700 --> 02:02:00.280
Was it running rampant through contention?

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.480
Next, he questioned them about the small silver spheres.

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:07.660
Keith explained that the contention PD had a bag,

02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:10.220
and when they put the silver ball in the bag,

02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:11.260
it disappeared.

02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.300
Marvin was curious about this.

02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:15.900
Would anything in the bag disappear?

02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:18.120
Keith admitted they never tried anything

02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:20.020
other than the metal spheres.

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:22.780
Marvin commented on the plural Keith used

02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:26.940
asked how many silver balls they'd come into contact with.

02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:29.580
Keith said they'd only made the one disappear,

02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:32.420
but another was found embedded in the skull

02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:36.460
of a severed head they'd pulled out of some storage units,

02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:39.820
adding that one of the contention PD

02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:41.760
touched the silver ball.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:43.860
Marvin assumed this was their coworker

02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:46.780
who was recently gunned down and ripped apart.

02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:49.400
Keith explained that John Lee Pettymore IV,

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.980
the man who held the sphere previously,

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:54.180
was inside Kevin's body.

02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:57.820
Marvin's eyes widened, as did Clark's.

02:02:57.820 --> 02:02:59.660
Clark thought Marvin had something to do

02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:00.940
with the body switching.

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:03.140
Skeptical of all of this information,

02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:05.820
Marvin extended a hand downward

02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:09.920
and pulled the body of John Lee Kevinmore the third up

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.640
from out of the water.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:14.140
With one hand holding Kevin's body,

02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:18.380
he used the other to twist open Kevin's head

02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.220
like an avocado.

02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:24.300
Sitting inside his head like the pit of an avocado

02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:26.820
was a small silver sphere.

02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:30.640
Marvin ripped Kevin's body in half right down the middle.

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.500
Where a spinal cord should have been, there was nothing.

02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:38.940
Since Clark and Keith were now gonna be a part

02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:41.460
of some heavy entertainment,

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:44.280
Marvin offered to answer a few questions.

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:47.660
Clark immediately asked what the silver balls are.

02:03:47.660 --> 02:03:49.900
Marvin has been doing research on them

02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:52.060
and has come to very few conclusions,

02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:54.900
though they are not from this realm.

02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:58.100
Marvin was working to secure their destruction.

02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:00.920
Keith asked where he found the balls.

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:03.300
One had been brought to him a long time ago

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:05.540
by two men he was seeking out.

02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:07.740
They, along with one other person,

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.980
had stolen something from him.

02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:12.660
Clark pointed out that when Marvin threw the sphere

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:16.100
at Rosemary, he was aware it did something.

02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:18.100
Marvin confirmed he knew the spheres

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:20.980
and intended to enter the person they touched,

02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.800
but Rosemary still shot the gun

02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.820
after being taken over by the sphere.

02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:26.260
Did it not work?

02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:29.040
Marvin admitted he didn't suspect the entity

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.540
would do anything other than try to kill itself

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.280
as it normally did.

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.420
Keith asked if Marvin knew anyone

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:38.620
with the previously described tribal tattoos.

02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:42.140
That was one of his sons, Jermaine Glass.

02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:45.640
Keith asked why Marvin wanted to destroy the spheres.

02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:48.280
Glass saw the balls as competition.

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.520
If he couldn't figure out how to utilize them,

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:52.920
he wanted them eradicated.

02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:55.960
Glass was in search of as much power as possible

02:04:55.960 --> 02:05:00.640
in an attempt to obtain control over this domain.

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.240
Finally, Clark asked what Marvin was.

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:06.280
Glass said he was not one of them,

02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:10.500
rather one of many who were in control, who ran things,

02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:13.920
but he had become bored, left the bureaucracy,

02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:17.600
and had been battling Myriad ever since.

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:19.400
Then Marvin snapped his fingers

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:22.160
and Keith and Clark were unconscious.

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:24.760
They awoke in a room with walls covered

02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:28.600
and every piece of weaponry and gadget imaginable.

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:31.020
A cage like the ones they'd been trapped in

02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:34.920
above the Den of Sin appeared at a darkened window.

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.200
Oz Mayhem Wolf climbed out,

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.640
said it seemed they were gonna fight together,

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.040
and excitedly grabbed his preferred combat gear.

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:46.640
A timer began counting down, water began filling the room,

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:49.280
and a circle opened above them.

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:52.680
A disorienting amount of light and sound hit

02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:55.880
as an unseen crowd chanted the name

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:59.880
of this group's opponent, Planet Juggernaut.

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:09.700
In a dark room lit by various electronics and machines,

02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:14.700
there sat a massive shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall,

02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:18.740
with silvery arms extending from either side.

02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:23.020
A tube connected this gargantuan ball to a machine below.

02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:26.260
The machine began whirring and a small metal sphere,

02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:28.100
roughly one inch in diameter,

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.620
began moving up through the tubing

02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:34.220
into the larger armed version of itself.

02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:38.740
As this happened, John Lee Pettymore IV felt

02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:42.580
alive again.

02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:45.540
John felt his consciousness extend itself

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:47.140
throughout his new body,

02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:50.940
this colossal monument to destruction.

02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:53.940
A vast circle opened up in the ceiling above,

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:56.780
and a disorienting amount of light and sound

02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:58.680
poured into this dark room,

02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:01.460
which revealed text painted on the back wall

02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:04.820
that read the same thing heard violently chanted

02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:08.820
by the unseen crowd, Planet Juggernaut.

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:14.060
Here's the way, here's the way, here's the way.

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:19.060
John gave his new hands a tentative punch together

02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:21.020
and dug in his foot.

02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:27.140
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and Oz Mayhem-Wolf

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:29.700
walked up the stairs and into the lights

02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:31.620
and sounds of the arena.

02:07:31.620 --> 02:07:35.300
This colossal room was circular and funneled downward,

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:37.180
at least 10 stories.

02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:41.700
Thousands of seats surrounded a massive covered cage,

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:45.940
50 yards across, with a bubble-looking rounded top on it,

02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:49.460
entirely made of a crystal-clear material.

02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:52.260
Aggressively loud dubstep blared,

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:56.140
strobe lights made the entire experience otherworldly,

02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:58.820
as green and red and blue lasers

02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:00.900
swung wildly around the room,

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:02.820
like a futuristic Las Vegas

02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:05.860
filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's films

02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.300
if they were tarred and feathered,

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:11.020
but the tar was replaced by Red Bull

02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:14.060
and the feathers replaced by cocaine.

02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.900
An enormous logo in the center of the arena floor

02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:20.700
read in all caps, The Scrap Pit.

02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:23.060
And all around the Scrap Pit,

02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:26.220
in a massive circle were the repeated words,

02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:28.600
Planet Juggernaut.

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:32.700
A gigantic circular jumbotron hung above the bubble,

02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:36.780
blinked a countdown timer and flashed the words,

02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:41.780
Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends versus Planet Juggernaut.

02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:46.260
The exceptional voices of Mick and Nick Nichols

02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.700
echoed through the pandemonium

02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:51.220
and announced an evening of bloodsport

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:54.060
the audience would never forget.

02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.620
The floor opened and Planet Juggernaut slowly rose

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:03.340
into the Scrap Pit to an explosion of roars

02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:05.140
from the eager audience.

02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:09.740
The sight of the gigantic shiny metal sphere 20 feet wide

02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:14.200
with two metallic arms extending from either side

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:16.820
knocked something loose in Clark.

02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:20.140
He lunged straight at Oz Mayhem Wolf in a frenzy

02:09:20.140 --> 02:09:21.940
and tried to rip his head off.

02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:25.980
A confused Oz Wolf ran away from his antagonistic teammate

02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:29.560
but clumsily tripped over and fell to the ground.

02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:32.640
Planet Juggernaut sent lasers blazing from its eyes

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.980
at Keith Vigna who jumped out of the way

02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:37.720
with his cool jumping boots.

02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:42.720
Mid air Keith shot Planet Juggernaut with a saw launcher

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.880
and embedded a circular saw

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:47.920
in the giant robot balls midsection.

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:51.240
Planet Juggernaut propelled itself into the air

02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.660
and landed on Oz Wolf as it slammed Clark down

02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:58.320
with its powerful metal hand.

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.880
Keith Spidermanned up the Scrap Pit wall

02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.520
with suction gloves and froze Planet Juggernaut's propeller

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:07.120
with a nitro thrower.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:11.320
A crushed Oz crawled out from beneath the burnished behemoth

02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:15.520
which sat eerily still as it clearly charged up something

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.920
somehow even more sinister.

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.020
Keith tried to release his suction cups from the dome

02:10:21.020 --> 02:10:22.320
but his feet were stuck.

02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.660
He looked into the apotent audience

02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:28.020
and saw a short young woman and tall old man

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:31.780
wearing suits, ties and ill fitting windbreakers.

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:34.900
He recognized agents Kennedy and McKinley

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:37.700
as they made their way through the crowd.

02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:40.900
Clark launched himself up onto Planet Juggernaut

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.900
which rapidly spun its exterior shell

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:46.580
while hovering just above the battleground

02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:49.740
in order to hit the pit rolling at a quick clip

02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:51.900
toward its slow foes.

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:55.500
This squashed Clark but absolutely obliterated

02:10:55.500 --> 02:11:00.020
Oz Mayhem Wolf into a pile of organs and teeth

02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:03.580
which sat in a dark red paste.

02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:08.580
As Nick and McNiggles discussed the mayhem scene and lost,

02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:12.340
a small hoover poked out of Planet Juggernaut

02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:17.340
to suck up and collect the loose teeth of Oz Wolf.

02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:20.900
An artificial wind began to pick up

02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:23.060
in the corner of the Scrap Pit

02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:24.900
and headed toward Clark Bishop

02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:27.620
who fired his high powered sniper rifle

02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:29.420
into the giant ball robot

02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:32.060
while thinking about his friend and coworker,

02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:34.100
John Lee Pennymore the fourth.

02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:38.020
Planet Juggernaut grabbed Clark with his extendo arms

02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:39.820
and Mickey Mouse gloves.

02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:44.140
It pulled Clark close and attempted to speak.

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:44.980
Clark.

02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:47.820
It's me.

02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:50.180
It's John.

02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:53.860
I don't wanna fight you.

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:58.060
We've gotta find a way outta here

02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:00.060
and into Marvin Glass's booth.

02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:03.780
Can we kill him together?

02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:07.020
Nick and McNiggles cut to a video segment

02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:10.100
incorrectly called Fighting Pro Tips

02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:13.860
from Alfred and Jermaine Glass.

02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:18.540
The jumbotron showed a dark room with a single light on.

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:20.580
A young man in the shadows of the room

02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.300
huddled in the field position

02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:25.060
and stammered about a gun,

02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:26.620
someone disappearing,

02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:28.420
it coming after him

02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:31.580
and a missing girl before the feed was cut off

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:35.340
and the attention turned back to inside the Scrap Pit.

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:38.540
In the clutches of the speaking Planet Juggernaut,

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.420
Clark's mind snapped

02:12:40.420 --> 02:12:43.700
and he pleaded for help from Planet Jonernaut

02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:46.460
who was focused on a young bald fit man

02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:50.620
with sunken intense eyes and a black t-shirt and jeans.

02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:55.060
Agent Billy Harrison was headed toward Marvin Glass's box.

02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:58.460
Planet Jonernaut threw himself with all its might

02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:01.060
into the dome above the Scrap Pit.

02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:02.980
The crystal clear material,

02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:05.380
considered indestructible by all

02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:07.980
who had fought inside its bubble previously,

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:09.020
shattered.

02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:13.180
Its pieces floated down into the pit like a firework.

02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:15.460
The crowd scattered for their lives,

02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:18.460
perhaps to add fuel to the confusion fire

02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:19.980
to aid in an escape,

02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:23.140
Keith Vigna sprayed his nitro thrower

02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:25.300
into the panicking mob.

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:28.820
Suddenly, a rushing cascade of murky water

02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:30.740
containing different kinds of fish

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.620
and a few humanoid figures

02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:35.780
blasted out from Marvin Glass's theater box.

02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:38.460
In the deluge were four flushed folks,

02:13:38.460 --> 02:13:41.340
Agents Kennedy, McKinley and Billy Harrison

02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:44.100
as well as a body wearing a tuxedo

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:48.300
with gaunt skin stretched across long bones.

02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:49.980
Marvin Glass.

02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:54.020
All four were washed into the middle of the Scrap Pit.

02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:56.460
Clark unloaded three rounds into Marvin

02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.540
and triggered a deafening roar.

02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.260
Ah!

02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:04.580
Planet Jonernaut requested that Clark jump up on him

02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:07.180
to avoid the ever rising tide.

02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:10.820
Keith, using his nitro thrower against the bad guy

02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:12.300
instead of the audience,

02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:15.700
completely encased the floating body of Marvin Glass

02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:18.380
in a sort of dry ice cube.

02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:20.820
Clark, from atop Planet Jonernaut,

02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:23.740
yelled to Keith the wacky and wondrous news

02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:26.340
that Planet Juggernaut was John.

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:29.900
Planet Jonernaut sent one extendo arm toward Keith

02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:33.500
as the other reached for a breach in the dome above.

02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:35.820
Keith threw down his riot shield,

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:40.180
rode it like a surfboard toward Jonernaut's extended hand

02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:42.340
and shot a saw through the middle

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.420
of the newly formed ice cube

02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:49.020
and directly into the frozen Marvin Glass trapped inside.

02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:52.020
The Scrap Pit began to shake violently

02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:55.180
and Jonernaut successfully pulled Keith and Clark

02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:58.140
up through the dome as lava moved up

02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:01.620
through the cracking and bubbling Scrap Pit.

02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:05.260
Marvin Glass, sliced by the saw and still frozen

02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:07.740
in this strange chemical compound,

02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:12.740
melted into the lava pit below and the scene changed.

02:15:14.860 --> 02:15:18.660
There was a road lined on either side by trees

02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:20.940
that reached over, blending together,

02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:23.500
creating an autumnal canopy.

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:27.340
A rabbit recklessly raced across the patchy pavement,

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:30.220
leaving behind a trail of blood thick enough

02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:32.740
to assume the animal's fate.

02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:36.340
A boxy black sedan drove furiously down the road,

02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:39.780
trailed closely by a four-wheeler.

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:42.180
They took a right down the gravel road,

02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:46.860
blowing past a sign that read, The Contention Woods,

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:50.860
and text at the bottom of the screen came up.

02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:54.700
25 years earlier.

02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:25.940
What's up, everybody?

02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:28.660
It's Zach, still Zach, so much Zach,

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:30.780
and we are now halfway through

02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:33.100
this stupidly overwhelming undertaking

02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:36.300
of a full recap of season one.

02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.940
It's been really fun and I'm so glad,

02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:42.940
I'm so glad, no, it's been a bit of a fucking nightmare,

02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:45.460
but it's halfway over, yay!

02:16:45.460 --> 02:16:48.500
Thankfully, we've had an absolute shitload of fun

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:50.740
recording some bonus content for everyone,

02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:53.460
which will be on this main feed soon.

02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:55.900
More on what exactly that entails

02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:58.580
at the end of this little epilogue.

02:16:58.580 --> 02:17:01.860
And later this month, patrons will see a new episode

02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:03.460
drop in that exclusive feed,

02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:06.420
wherein I run Joe, Luke, and Thomas

02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:09.220
through a space adventure in a space game

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:11.520
of space roll for shoes.

02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:14.780
That session was seriously some of the most lighthearted,

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:16.900
enjoyable role play I've ever had the pleasure

02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:18.140
to take privilege in.

02:17:18.140 --> 02:17:19.140
Ha ha ha ha!

02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:23.700
All right, and for those of you who slosh around

02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:26.100
in the Den of Sin, be on the lookout

02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:28.060
for a live stream this weekend.

02:17:28.060 --> 02:17:30.820
We'll post the time and date on our Twitter

02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:34.000
and Instagram at PretendingPod.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.100
We're playing a game called, oh fuck, I can't remember,

02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:41.920
Patrick, something about Patrick, Inside Patrick.

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:44.620
We're all, we're all, no.

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:47.500
As for the next and third part of this here

02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:50.980
season one recap project, I need your help

02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:53.940
and I'm willing to send you clothes in return.

02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:56.260
There's a link in the show notes and on Twitter,

02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:59.120
Fuck Jack Dorsey and Facebook, Fuck Mark Zuckerberg,

02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:01.140
to a Google Doc we can all share.

02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:03.180
It'll have the transcript for this episode

02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:05.700
which covered episodes 24 through 46

02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.420
as well as the previous recap

02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:09.260
covering episodes one through 23.

02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:13.780
Now, if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:16.200
recapping an episode of this show,

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:19.740
you will be entered to win a PTBP t-shirt.

02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:23.640
Now, if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:26.480
recapping three or more episodes,

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:31.220
you will be entered to win one of five PTBP t-shirts.

02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:33.720
So if only five people write up three or more episodes,

02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:35.040
boom, you got a shirt.

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:38.560
And finally, if you really go heels to Betsy on this,

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:41.680
if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.720
recapping five or more episodes,

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.400
I will guarantee you a PTBP t-shirt.

02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:52.240
And leave your handle or email address commented in there

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.860
so we know who wrote what and how to contact you

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:58.560
in case we get to ship you a shirt like Dylan B did.

02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:02.360
Dylan B wrote recaps for six episodes

02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:04.960
and a shirt is on its way.

02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:08.860
Also, an enormous shout out to Here Be Tigers

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:13.360
from the Discord who so far has written four recaps

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:16.280
that were absolutely excellent.

02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.900
For those of you looking into joining this project

02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:22.100
and earning a shirt, those recaps by Here Be Tigers

02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:24.600
are what you should model your work after.

02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.960
Succinct but thorough, ugh, bless you, Here Be Tigers.

02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:31.180
So please, join us, earn a shirt,

02:19:31.180 --> 02:19:34.200
and help us finish the remaining two recap episodes

02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:37.600
so we can deliver you the final arc of season one

02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.160
of Pretending to Be People.

02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:41.720
I am so very excited.

02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:44.680
Now, the next episode you see on this main feed

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.080
will be a bonus.

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:49.280
Unfortunately, Luke wasn't able to join us

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:51.040
because he got COVID.

02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.200
Wear a fucking mask.

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:55.480
Thankfully, he is feeling much better now

02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:59.400
and will be joining us for the end of this bonus scenario,

02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:02.360
which is a game of Call of Cthulhu

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:06.160
with guest keeper Scott Dorward,

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:09.780
an RPG writer and editor whose name might sound familiar

02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:13.340
because he co-authored the Pope Cthulhu campaign,

02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:15.960
Two-Headed Serpent, as well as a collection

02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:20.060
of six scenarios for Call of Cthulhu named Nameless Horrors.

02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:24.100
He also wrote an excellent scenario called Hell in Texas

02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:26.740
that's in Stygian Fox's Cthulhu modern book

02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:28.740
called The Things We Leave Behind,

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:32.620
and so, so, so much other amazing material.

02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:35.480
Scott is also an established podcaster,

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:39.020
and I have personally listened to every episode

02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:41.860
of The Good Friends of Jackson Elias,

02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:44.980
a podcast about Call of Cthulhu, horror films,

02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:47.260
and horror gaming in general.

02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:50.080
Scott is a magnificent game master

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:54.340
with the voice of an angel in the mind of an elder god,

02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:59.340
and we had a disgusting, revolting, marvelous time

02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:01.860
playing a scenario he wrote and published

02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:04.980
set in a Hooverville in the Great Depression

02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:07.900
entitled Bleak Prospect.

02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:11.020
Thank you, thank you all so much

02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:13.500
for your continued support.

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:14.620
Times are hard.

02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:15.840
Check in on your friends.

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.900
Be honest, be vulnerable.

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:19.820
Admit it when you need help.

02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:21.800
I'm finally doing that myself.

02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:24.700
For years, I've said everyone should be in therapy,

02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:27.620
all while not seeing a therapist.

02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:30.200
I even got my degree in behavioral science.

02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:31.700
I understood the benefits.

02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:35.180
I understood it would help me, but I was scared.

02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:36.020
Well, fuck that.

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:38.660
I'm still scared, but I'm not gonna let that stop me.

02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:41.940
So I'm starting therapy, and I'm consciously working

02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:43.660
to become who I want to be.

02:21:45.780 --> 02:21:46.920
I hope you're all doing well.

02:21:46.920 --> 02:21:47.980
This was all very serious.

02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:51.660
Quick, picture Tom Hanks in a courtroom.

02:21:51.660 --> 02:21:54.540
He's the judge, but he's wearing a mesh crop top,

02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:57.020
and you're pretty sure his nipples are pierced

02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:59.860
and connected by a nerd's rope.

02:21:59.860 --> 02:22:00.700
Okay, bye.

02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:02.460
Hot dog.

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:39.200
Am I the only one trying to pull over?

02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:47.700
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:53.700
This love I know.

02:22:53.700 --> 02:23:01.700
This love I know.

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:05.700
Fly to fly to the stream.
