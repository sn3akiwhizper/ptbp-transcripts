00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Greasy greetings to all of our fantastic listeners out there.

00:05.500 --> 00:10.900
It is I, the mesmerizing, masticating mutt, Wolf the dog,

00:10.900 --> 00:15.500
Yo DJ, your host, Angel Parental Figure,

00:15.500 --> 00:18.500
and you, fantastic listeners,

00:18.500 --> 00:26.800
are doing a fantastic job of listening to us here at 694.2 PTBP,

00:26.800 --> 00:30.800
coming at you live from some time somewhere.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.300
Who even knows when or where I am anymore?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.000
I certainly don't.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.500
But what I do know is that we got ourselves another Howlin' with Wolf,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.800
and that makes my teeth rattle with joy.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.300
This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Ikaris,

00:47.300 --> 00:51.200
who tweeted about the show and tagged "@pretendingpart",

00:51.200 --> 00:56.600
the equivalent of 8.5 normal-sized good deeds or 3.6,

00:56.600 --> 00:58.700
whatever, either way.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.700
Shouts out to Ikaris for telling folks the good news.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.500
Ikaris writes,

01:04.500 --> 01:12.100
I'm sorry for picturing you drinking the grease I used to eject from the name-redacted fast food bin.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.500
It still makes me sick, and I have no idea how you do it.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.100
But you do you, Mr. Wolf.

01:19.100 --> 01:25.200
That grease has to go somewhere, and I guess you eating it is better than a landfill.

01:25.200 --> 01:30.600
Everyone listen to the podcast. It's a fantastic time, Phil.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.300
Thank you for your time.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.600
Well, damn, thanks for writing in, Ikaris.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.000
I am the gleeful grease trap.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.900
You got grease you need disposed of?

01:41.900 --> 01:44.000
I'm here to gobble it up.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.200
And even if you don't want me to, I'll probably still grab a gulp of three.

01:49.200 --> 01:56.200
Much of the grease I consume immediately spreads itself amongst my many hair follicles,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.600
coating them and making me more...

01:58.600 --> 02:01.100
aerodynamic?

02:01.100 --> 02:02.400
I don't know, y'all.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.800
I just know that after I get that grease, I'm slipping around faster than hell.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.800
Now, if you want to write up something for your greasy wolf to howl,

02:11.800 --> 02:14.700
tag "@pretendingpart on Instagram",

02:14.700 --> 02:17.000
tag "@pretendingpart on Twitter",

02:17.000 --> 02:19.800
tag "@pretendingto be people on Facebook",

02:19.800 --> 02:25.900
or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and holler at your wolf about it.

02:25.900 --> 02:32.100
If you want to support the show and make sure it doesn't disappear into a smooth void,

02:32.100 --> 02:40.200
exchange financial support for bonus content over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

02:40.200 --> 02:46.800
If you want to find links to all our shit here at 694.2 PTBP,

02:46.800 --> 02:50.200
the links are in the show notes.

02:50.200 --> 02:55.000
Don't blink, don't think, just sink into the deep.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.200
It's time for the news.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.800
Last time, the Cannes crew went to Julius and X's house,

03:01.800 --> 03:04.800
cleaned up a bit and discussed next steps.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.800
But Julius is clearly having a harder time dealing with recent events.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.600
Will Cal and Beck agree to work alongside X?

03:13.600 --> 03:20.600
This woman who clearly has no regard for Julius's health in the names of truth and journalism?

03:20.600 --> 03:23.800
Will Stevie and Cal keep each other's trust?

03:23.800 --> 03:28.600
Will Julius's loss of grip lead him to losing himself?

03:28.600 --> 03:32.000
Will Beck get even wilder?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.600
All this and more coming at you right after Alter Girl with

03:36.600 --> 03:40.600
My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

03:43.600 --> 03:50.600
Cause my life is great and it's all mine.

03:57.600 --> 04:05.600
Cause my life is great and it's all my fault.

04:14.600 --> 04:19.600
I was saying, cause you build your sandwich here and then you go, yeah, you go to your next station.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.600
You're only that next station.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.600
Yeah, I don't know, a bunch of shredded lettuce and then I fucking kill myself.

04:25.600 --> 04:31.600
I beat up who's ever keeping me from the meat bins and take what's mine.

04:31.600 --> 04:36.600
I'd take down a bunch of banana peppers probably. I'm a big fan of eating those, just raw.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
Yeah, that'd be good.

04:37.600 --> 04:44.600
Banana peppers are solid. Cuc, tomato, Sammy. Cuc on either side of the tomato with some Dijon mustard.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.600
Can you cut the part of him saying, I love eating those raw?

04:48.600 --> 04:51.600
I mean, if meats are out, bread's out.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.600
Yeah, the Sammy was the cucumber. The cuc was the bread.

04:56.600 --> 05:01.600
Can I have the fish scoopables?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
Like tuna?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.600
The fish scoopables.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.600
That's a main protein. I think that's excluded.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.600
Damn it. Cheese?

05:12.600 --> 05:15.600
Cheese is a topping. No, cheese goes on first.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.600
Technically cheese is part of that first bracket.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.600
Can I go somewhere else?

05:23.600 --> 05:26.600
I don't like this restaurant.

05:26.600 --> 05:31.600
I'll just eat tomatoes with oil and vinegar.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.600
There you go.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.600
They have secret shakers up there and oregano is one of them.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.600
You guys throw some oregano on there?

05:39.600 --> 05:42.600
Oh, he's definitely getting that on the tomato. Maybe a little salt and pepper too.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.600
I'm going to get the oregano shaker, put oil in it and eat that.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.600
Like soup, oregano soup.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.600
Oregano soup.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.600
Can I throw it in the bread toaster?

05:54.600 --> 05:58.600
Oh, hey, my whole family's from Italy. We were from oregano.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.600
Why can you toast it?

06:00.600 --> 06:01.600
I'm going to say you can toast it.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.600
You can toast it.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
That's the perk.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.600
Then I will have shredded lettuce toasted, please.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.600
Line out the door immediately.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.600
Did you say shredded lettuce toasted?

06:13.600 --> 06:14.600
That's it.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.600
Burnt ends, baby.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.600
I'll have the vegan burnt ends.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.600
That's just singed lettuce.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.600
All right, I'll start recording.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
Yeah, we should have been recording that.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.600
You know how somebody's doing the transcripts for all the episodes?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.600
Oh, yeah. Can we shout out Cinder Crow?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.600
A true American hero.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
Who's doing it?

06:35.600 --> 06:36.600
Or wherever you're from.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.600
You're a hero to us in America, so you're an American hero.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.600
You're our American hero.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
Well, I was thinking, because I read through some of it,

06:43.600 --> 06:46.600
and it's really detailed and good,

06:46.600 --> 06:52.600
so what if we made some funny sounds and words to see what it does?

06:52.600 --> 06:55.600
Oh, yeah. We should really start trying to mess with this guy.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
Flurbin, lurbin, shlick.

06:58.600 --> 07:01.600
I'm going to say there, there, there, there.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
Which ones am I using?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.600
Oh, my gosh.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.600
You're a nightmare to people like him.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
Who knows?

07:07.600 --> 07:12.600
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.600
Seriously.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
Cinder Crow.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.600
Huge shout out to Cinder Crow.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.600
Absolutely.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
That is so insane.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.600
You rock.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
Thank you so much.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.600
Bazinga.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.600
Now you've got to write Bazinga in your transcript.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
Yeah.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.600
Also, you get to write our season two recap episodes.

07:28.600 --> 07:32.600
Honestly, because of the transcripts, we don't have to do those.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.600
I mean, that seems...

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
Well, we can do those. It's just you've got notes.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.600
Okay. All right. I'll start now.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.600
Six months off.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.600
I don't think it'll be as hard this time.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.600
No, I'll still do it.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.600
The recap episodes, they were fun for you to do, right?

07:49.600 --> 07:53.600
That was like a pleasurable part of this life venture, right?

07:53.600 --> 07:54.600
This life venture, right?

07:54.600 --> 07:58.600
I started sweating through both shirts.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.600
Seriously, if you haven't checked out the transcripts

08:00.600 --> 08:04.600
or if you know someone who would be into the transcripts,

08:04.600 --> 08:05.600
you can find them.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.600
They're linked over on our Discord,

08:07.600 --> 08:09.600
and you can find that Discord...

08:09.600 --> 08:11.600
In the show notes.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
In the show notes.

08:13.600 --> 08:20.600
Another big, big part of this is that I've been training in AI on those transcripts.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.600
And so pretty soon, none of us will be necessary,

08:23.600 --> 08:28.600
which means all of your Patreon money will go straight to making the pod better.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.600
We're all cut out from that process as soon as I perfect this machine.

08:34.600 --> 08:38.600
I read one of the AI transcripts that you generated,

08:38.600 --> 08:42.600
and my favorite part was the guy who is playing Luke,

08:42.600 --> 08:43.600
and he says,

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
This mystery's mysterious!

08:45.600 --> 08:49.600
And then fart noises for 45 seconds.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.600
It's absurdly accurate.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
That was a good one.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.600
Speaking of fart noises...

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
Yeah.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
Human fart noise.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.600
Taylor just walked in.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.600
Wow.

09:00.600 --> 09:03.600
And gave it to us good on the mic.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
See you guys.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
Bye.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.600
Bye.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.600
We can cut all that out.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.600
Just the end and the buy.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.600
Last night, this home security salesman came to my house,

09:14.600 --> 09:15.600
and it was fucking...

09:15.600 --> 09:16.600
It was after dark.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.600
I had not turned my French ports light on,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.600
so I just get this knock on my door,

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
and I can see nothing.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
Ugh.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
So I open it up, it's just the fucking...

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
Did you turn the light on?

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
I turned the light on.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
It's the vivid guy.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
It's good he wasn't blurry.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
He's like,

09:29.600 --> 09:32.600
Hey, I assume you're the homeowner or the renter?

09:32.600 --> 09:33.600
And I was like,

09:33.600 --> 09:34.600
Yeah, I'm the renter.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.600
And he's like,

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
Well, you know, this isn't the highest crime area,

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
but talking to some of your neighbors tonight,

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
I know there's a lot of petty crimes,

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600
like package thefts and car break-ins,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.600
so if you'd be interested in a camera or anything,

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
and I was like,

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
Oh no, I'm the one doing all those,

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
so I don't want any more cameras.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.600
What?

09:48.600 --> 09:49.600
Did you really?

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
Yeah.

09:50.600 --> 09:57.600
Oh my god, what did he say?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
He just laughed nervously,

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
and then I shut the door on him.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
He said,

10:01.600 --> 10:03.600
You should buy all my cameras then.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
Once they're gone, they're gone.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.600
I opened up my door the other day to a doorbell ring,

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
and it must have been the knock.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.600
My doorbell doesn't work.

10:12.600 --> 10:20.600
And a young lad on one of those bird scooters.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.600
It wasn't a bird.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.600
It was a plane.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.600
You stand flat on it.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
Superman.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.600
And there's just two wheels on either side of your feet.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.600
Oh, those.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.600
Like, yeah.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.600
Like a hoverboard thing.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.600
They call them hoverboards.

10:30.600 --> 10:31.600
Yeah, the hoverboard.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.600
He was just hoverboarding around the neighborhood.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Nice.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.600
How old was he?

10:35.600 --> 10:38.600
He couldn't have been a day over, what?

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
Seven.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.600
Seven, yeah.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.600
Those labor laws, man, in Missouri.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
What was he selling?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.600
How many Bibles did you buy?

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
He said pest control,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.600
and I just closed my door and was like,

10:50.600 --> 10:53.600
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

10:53.600 --> 10:58.600
That's when they sprinkle the bag of pests on the lawn.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.600
Like, okay, I'll be back in a few weeks.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.600
Yeah, so as you can see, my legs are now covered.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
I'm not wearing pants.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
These are ticks.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.600
You got pests everywhere.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.600
Should we do it?

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
Should we do it?

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
Should we do it?

11:11.600 --> 11:12.600
I'm really excited to do it.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
I don't know what we're going to do.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.600
You just said, like, pants made out of ticks.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.600
Are we not already in it?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.600
That's what Beck Wilder sees.

11:21.600 --> 11:28.600
No, as Beck Wilder, Cal Colorado, Julius Summers, his roommate, X, Stevie Godel, and Jeremy,

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600
the intern.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Jeremy.

11:30.600 --> 11:36.600
Do we need, do we need euphemisms like roommate now that we know?

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
Okay, X.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.600
We'll just go with X, his co-worker.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
Yeah, we'll say co-worker.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.600
X.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.600
That's, again, a euphemism.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
But technically true.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.600
But so his roommate is technically true as well.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.600
She's many things.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.600
Isn't she your boss?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.600
Some people could look at it that way.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.600
Sure.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
Yeah, a little bit, maybe.

11:57.600 --> 12:05.600
And they're all, you're all at the close to empty house where Julius and X are living.

12:05.600 --> 12:12.600
It's Wednesday, July 6th, 2022, and it is quite late.

12:12.600 --> 12:18.600
On a fairly rough note, even though he just taken the time to clean a few folks' guts

12:18.600 --> 12:26.480
and spray from off himself and change suits, Julius is openly bleeding once again, half

12:26.480 --> 12:30.600
of his face now scraped in raw, beating up with his own blood.

12:30.600 --> 12:37.600
And on a more positive note, Stevie just realized they trust Cal Colorado.

12:37.600 --> 12:43.600
Jeremy, the intern, stands up from the Ikea couch and stretches his arms and legs while

12:43.600 --> 12:46.600
letting out a big old yawn, signaling his exit.

12:46.600 --> 12:51.600
And on his way out, he squares his shoulders to Cal and assures you,

12:51.600 --> 12:56.600
I won't say a word until you arrive at Cannes in 48 hours as the producer.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.600
Just idle nose and coffees for everyone.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.600
And with that, he's off.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
48 hours?

13:03.600 --> 13:08.600
That's what X had told you is that she needed 48 hours to kind of clean up the Julius mess

13:08.600 --> 13:12.600
before you were to be named the new producer.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.600
And then that's when we can air the footage as well?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.600
Yep.

13:15.600 --> 13:21.600
And X looking down at her phone says to Julius,

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
I've just alerted the doctor.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600
She's on her way.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.600
Would I know this doctor?

13:26.600 --> 13:32.600
I'm not exactly sure if you've met this one, but one of the few in the city that

13:32.600 --> 13:34.600
knows to look the other way, I suppose.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
What's their name?

13:35.600 --> 13:37.600
She looks down at her phone again.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.600
I guess we just call her Dr. Murray.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.600
Dr. Murray.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.600
Hmm.

13:43.600 --> 13:49.600
Is it going to be the usual or, I mean, do we have access to those Godel things?

13:49.600 --> 13:53.600
She kind of looks at the other three of you.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
I can attest that they work like a charm, dude.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.600
He got killed.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.600
No, not killed, but almost died from a rabbit.

14:01.600 --> 14:08.600
He was very much impaled by a, not a real jackalope, but a rabbit who had been senselessly

14:08.600 --> 14:14.600
tied up with antlers to resemble a jackalope and then left to wander willy nilly.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.600
And of course it was going to impale someone.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.600
You know, of course someone was going to trip and impale themselves on that.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.600
It was a hazard.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.600
It was a hazard.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.600
But yes, the medicine thing they had.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
It wasn't my fault.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
It wasn't his fault.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.600
But, like, it's me that's going to die now.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.600
So, like, do we?

14:29.600 --> 14:32.600
Well, you don't look like you're going to die.

14:32.600 --> 14:33.600
I don't feel very good.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.600
He kind of does, though.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
Look at him.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.600
How many hit points do you have?

14:36.600 --> 14:40.600
This is the first time you've cared about that in three days.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.600
It's all rushing back to him.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.600
It hurts.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.600
I'm at 40 percent capacity, it feels like.

14:47.600 --> 14:53.600
You were at, like, 10 percent capacity and insisted we not take you to a hospital.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.600
Sometimes the heat of the moment.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.600
I had the napkins shoved in me and they were helping.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.600
And he points to the napkins shoved in his gun wound.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.600
And Beck winks at Stevie.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.600
Yeah, man.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.600
Good work.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Thanks.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
I do the best that I can.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
Is she coming here?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.600
Yes, she is close by.

15:13.600 --> 15:20.600
Stevie, as fine as your improvisational work was, we do need a real doctor to look at you.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.600
The door slams open.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.600
What is the doctor, Murray?

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
A doctor of?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.600
Yeah, the real doctor you say that you need.

15:26.600 --> 15:35.600
And this elderly woman with thick gray hair, thin and wiry and built five feet tall and

15:35.600 --> 15:39.600
created by Chainsaw Unicorn from Augusta, Georgia.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.600
Shout out to Chainsaw Unicorn.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.600
Unicorn noise.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
Whoa, is that what a unicorn sounds like?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, the hiss and squish.

15:59.600 --> 16:07.600
Chainsaw Unicorn is patron at at least the $10 level over on patreon.com slash pretending pod.

16:07.600 --> 16:13.600
And you too can send in an NPC or a location at that tier and support the show over there.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.600
You know what not enough people take advantage of is they can describe the voice.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.600
That's a very true statement, yes.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.600
And I don't know if you can see.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.600
Because otherwise they all sound like this.

16:24.600 --> 16:29.600
I don't know if you can see, but I'm wearing clothes that are two sizes too big.

16:29.600 --> 16:34.600
Looks like a strong wind could turn me into a pretty awesome kite.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.600
But yes, I'm here to help you.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.600
I'm here to help you out.

16:38.600 --> 16:43.600
Who's the benevolent neither of the help.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.600
Oh, look at you.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
Look at your face.

16:46.600 --> 16:52.600
Julius looks at Cal and Beck and is like, yeah, they're generally pretty.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.600
They're always this weird.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.600
And I thought you hadn't met him.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.600
I hadn't, but I mean, like all the doctors that they send are this weird.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.600
So why don't you want to go to a fucking hospital?

17:05.600 --> 17:09.600
This is like been my only interaction with doctors ever.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.600
Yeah, sure. They're all a little weird, but not like this.

17:13.600 --> 17:20.600
Julius rips his shirt off and just points to his bloody mess with napkins and everything shoved in it.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.600
Oh, yeah. Okay. I see. I see.

17:23.600 --> 17:29.600
Okay, you're going to need to have your lay down on the on the kitchen island table over there, the countertop.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.600
Just strip on down to your baccas.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.600
Yeah, I heard I heard about the incident the last time.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.600
Oh, Mr. Big Thighs had had is the doctor.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.600
Things got bad.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.600
And now we can we talk less?

17:43.600 --> 17:47.600
Maybe just kind of I'm for gossip.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.600
That's kind of my whole thing.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.600
Okay. Tell me.

17:49.600 --> 17:56.600
It's funny. Tell me the juiciest stuff, but it hurts and ripping the napkins about.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.600
But with a Swift, let's see a Swift.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.600
Oh, a extreme.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
It's not good.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
No, it's extremely good.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.600
I rolled a 77, but she has an 80.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
Fuck yeah.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.600
I was just, you know, I figured that's pretty high.

18:14.600 --> 18:23.600
One plus three is four hit points are restored back to you as she rips you up, tears you down and sews you up.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.600
Basically without you even realizing it.

18:26.600 --> 18:34.600
And then for the final critical role trick here, she goes, oh, and I got something real fucking neat for your face.

18:34.600 --> 18:39.600
And she has a suitcase with her that she cracks open for the first time.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.600
Everything previous has just been in her bag.

18:42.600 --> 18:52.600
And inside the suitcase, you see a contraption that, while familiar, does have very specifically different sort of branding.

18:53.600 --> 19:02.600
Cal's trying to be subtle, but he, uh, he very clearly is like taking a picture of this and he's winking to Beck for the story.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
Yeah.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.600
And everyone is like pretty in awe.

19:06.600 --> 19:15.600
Like this is as if we were standing around and someone pulled out like a very cool new contraption that yeah, like that we hadn't seen before.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.600
Like what would a new three.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
Thank you.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.600
Dicked dildo.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.600
Oh my God. Can you imagine?

19:20.600 --> 19:21.600
I've seen that.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.600
New Xbox.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.600
Not with prehensile balls.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.600
Those are the two kinds of jokes you're going to get here pretending to be people.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.600
Oh doc, patch me up.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.600
What do you call that thing?

19:38.600 --> 19:42.600
Well, I've been calling it the skin graft 2000.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.600
Awesome.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.600
We can hook you up with some marketing people to work on that.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.600
That does seem fair.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.600
I don't know what the folks upstairs are going to call it.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.600
It's July of 2022, so 2000 doesn't seem very futuristic anymore.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.600
Well, they don't need names for stuff in the military probably.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.600
No, no, they, they all have names for their things.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.600
Oh, well, who's the marketing people for the military?

20:04.600 --> 20:07.600
Oh, well, I mean.

20:07.600 --> 20:13.600
And she slams, she slams this, uh, this device on, on Julius Summers face.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.600
You know, when the question itself is so wrong, you don't know where to begin to answer.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.600
Does it feel good?

20:22.600 --> 20:24.600
That's a good question.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.600
Beck, do you remember what it felt like?

20:27.600 --> 20:29.600
I think it was good.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.600
Yeah.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.600
Uh, go ahead and, sorry, I was waiting for whatever this is.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.600
Feels so good.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.600
Beck is filming the process and no one has a problem with that.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
Oh man, it feels good.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.600
Yeah.

20:51.600 --> 21:06.600
Dr. Murray says, and you feel the, these like warm rays like shining in, penetrating, and then you feel a sort of tingle almost like a, like a foaming sensation that you can hear.

21:06.600 --> 21:12.600
And then it's, it's like, like pop rocks is kind of the vibe.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.600
Yeah.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
Pop rocks with a mouthful of Sprite.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.600
And you feel warm.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.600
You feel nice.

21:22.600 --> 21:31.600
She pulls it off and everyone looking sees Julius Summers with a face, a whole face.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.600
Nothing but a face, so help me God.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
It's his?

21:38.600 --> 21:39.600
Yeah.

21:39.600 --> 21:46.600
It's just completely cleaned up every single cut and skin is smooth.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.600
Just matching the other half of his face.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.600
Julius, you look like a million bucks.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
It feels great.

21:53.600 --> 21:57.600
I mean, God, we, we got to tell people about this stuff.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.600
Hey doc, can I get a hit of that?

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
Yeah, what do you need?

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
What do you need?

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
What is going on?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.600
I mean, I just haven't felt a hundred percent the same since I fell on that Jackalope.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.600
Why don't you just give me a top up?

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
Okay.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.600
You said it was a, you sat on it.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
Yeah.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
All right.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
Face down.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
Ass up.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
All right.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
That's the way I'll stitch you up.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.600
You got it.

22:19.600 --> 22:27.600
Beck bends over the couch and he just flips up the shirt tails on his Hawaiian shirt and

22:27.600 --> 22:28.600
jacket.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.600
Yeah.

22:29.600 --> 22:30.600
Jacket.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.600
You receive four hit points.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.600
Yeah.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.600
Cal Cal took the camera from you and it's filming that, but his thumb is like over a

22:38.600 --> 22:46.600
quarter of the lens, which is really hard to do on a camera like this.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
Huge thumbs.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
We never talked about it.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.600
Did I recover any hit points from the face?

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
Uh, healing.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.600
Uh, no, that was with two rolls.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
Unfortunately.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.600
That was your sweet.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.600
Yeah.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.600
At least I look good.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.600
Julius thinks and then makes a note to go check.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.600
Julius.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.600
I have a little pocket mirror, uh, in my makeup kit that you could use.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.600
All anchors carry these all reporters carry these.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
Take a look at that.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.600
Don't go back into that bathroom please.

23:10.600 --> 23:15.600
Uh, Hey doctor, doctor Murray, could I get one of those for, you know, before I go on

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
air?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.600
Oh, you want, you like, you want to have one.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.600
I want to, I want to be able to do the face thing.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.600
Well, these are very important to the firm currently.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.600
And uh, what, what firm?

23:27.600 --> 23:29.600
Well, the program, you know, the group, you know?

23:29.600 --> 23:30.600
Yeah.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
What's that called?

23:31.600 --> 23:32.600
No name for it.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.600
Obviously.

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
Obviously.

23:34.600 --> 23:37.600
Julius chuckles too.

23:37.600 --> 23:42.600
Well, his name's for things that exist.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
My dear boy.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
Yes.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.600
And we don't exist.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.600
Wink, wink.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
She winks.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.600
I look back at Beck and see if he was filming that.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.600
I was.

23:53.600 --> 23:58.600
I wink at Beck.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.600
That puts the lens cover on and off.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.600
Oh my God.

24:03.600 --> 24:09.600
A little camera wink.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
But you said that it was military issues.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.600
So you're military.

24:12.600 --> 24:18.600
Well, you know, uh, I suppose every once in a while, you know, I get there, I become it.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.600
What kind of doctor are you Dr. Murray?

24:20.600 --> 24:23.600
Mostly, uh, surgical.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.600
People?

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
People.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.600
Yeah, of course people.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
Okay.

24:28.600 --> 24:32.600
Well, and if he got something else laying around, I'll look at it.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
Of course.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.600
Cal thinks about that.

24:36.600 --> 24:43.600
Of course.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.600
We may have a person who's half a god turtle.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.600
He probably, Stevie.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.600
I mean, yeah, but we don't know where he is.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.600
That should be our top priority though.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
Right?

24:55.600 --> 24:56.600
Finding your brother.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
We've got a clear 48 hours.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.600
I think that's maybe our next plan of attack.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.600
Breaks in the news cycle like this don't come often, Stevie.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
Yeah.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
Yeah.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
No, you're right.

25:06.600 --> 25:11.900
That, that's exactly, that's exactly what we should do.

25:11.900 --> 25:26.480
And they show you a Reddit post that only has like 460, that only has like 800 and 36

25:26.480 --> 25:27.480
upvotes on it.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.480
That's a lot.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.480
Yeah.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.480
It's doing all right.

25:31.480 --> 25:32.480
Yeah.

25:32.480 --> 25:41.480
And it is a hole in the ground somewhere in South America.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.480
Oh shit.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.480
Uh oh.

25:43.480 --> 25:48.080
I don't know if he's like available.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.080
He's gone international.

25:49.080 --> 25:54.400
I want to show that to X and see what her reaction is.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.200
Is this a particularly smooth hole?

25:56.200 --> 25:58.920
Oh, it's an incredibly smooth hole.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.400
How does she react to that?

26:02.400 --> 26:03.880
Um, wow.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.240
Uh, what does the article say about it?

26:07.240 --> 26:14.920
Yeah, it says that it's, um, there is some sort of like a lightning tornado storm and

26:14.920 --> 26:23.080
now the, yeah, that no one's going near the hole cause they can actually see down, but

26:23.080 --> 26:29.540
they can keep seeing down until they can't see any more down, I guess.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.920
Does your brother have a place in South America or your family?

26:32.920 --> 26:33.920
Well, yeah.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
Where?

26:34.920 --> 26:37.520
Is it a place like the gorge?

26:37.520 --> 26:40.400
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.360
There's, there's no more of those.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.960
So it's like a place that you vacation?

26:43.960 --> 26:48.640
Well, no, I mean we have a home down there, but it's not even in the same country as this.

26:48.640 --> 26:59.840
It's like, ah, we have, we have a, we have a home in Brazil and cow goes, I said it,

26:59.840 --> 27:03.280
I said it normally zoom in and enhance that picture.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.280
Where's it from?

27:04.280 --> 27:05.360
This happened in Chile.

27:05.360 --> 27:12.400
She just swipes on the screen to enlarge it.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.240
Do any of you guys speak Spanish?

27:14.240 --> 27:15.240
Okay.

27:15.840 --> 27:20.640
See, that's, that's not a whole, and like one of the top comments is linking another

27:20.640 --> 27:26.520
Reddit article that is in Europe and it's like a huge hole in the ground.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.520
That's very smooth.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.200
Stevie how many, how many of these are there?

27:31.200 --> 27:32.200
I don't know.

27:32.200 --> 27:39.120
I just started seeing them like today, but there, there seems to be a few, a fair, fair

27:39.120 --> 27:40.720
amount of them.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.120
Are they just all in the ground?

27:42.120 --> 27:45.640
Are they in other, yeah.

27:45.640 --> 27:52.440
One went through a building like half, like half of a building is just like gone.

27:52.440 --> 27:57.560
So Stevie, do you know anything about this power your brother has or what these holes

27:57.560 --> 27:58.560
are for?

27:58.560 --> 28:09.080
I mean, I know that, um, they're starting to get tears in their eyes.

28:09.080 --> 28:20.920
I know that my granddad and I guess my dad were keeping it trapped and we like let it

28:20.920 --> 28:21.920
out or whatever.

28:21.920 --> 28:27.040
And then I let it out or whatever.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.040
On the bridge?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.040
I didn't know it was there.

28:30.040 --> 28:33.760
I didn't, he just did like immediately.

28:33.760 --> 28:34.760
What did you see?

28:34.760 --> 28:36.400
I mean, I saw the same as everybody else.

28:36.400 --> 28:41.120
I saw, I saw the lightning, like the tunnel from like afar.

28:41.120 --> 28:47.520
I wasn't even over there, but I didn't know what it was at first and it started dawning

28:47.520 --> 28:48.520
on me.

28:48.520 --> 28:52.760
This is a very important question, Stevie.

28:52.760 --> 28:56.320
Between then and now, have you contacted anyone in your family?

28:56.320 --> 29:05.120
No, just like the cops, you know, to like try to do the whole blackmail thing.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.640
How come God couldn't teleport out of Grover's gorge?

29:08.640 --> 29:10.800
Is there a spell?

29:10.800 --> 29:12.200
No, I think he is.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.200
I think he was in a turtle.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.720
So being in a human is what caused?

29:16.720 --> 29:20.720
Or maybe there's a spell like, oh, that might be it.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.600
When it was in a turtle, were there like little holes maybe?

29:23.600 --> 29:24.600
Or slow holes?

29:24.600 --> 29:25.880
Oh, there you go.

29:25.880 --> 29:29.360
Slow tiny holes.

29:29.360 --> 29:34.520
Like aerated lawn or like, no, I don't.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.520
Little microbursts.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.160
Not that I know of.

29:37.160 --> 29:42.280
They might've looked like potholes, divots, but very smooth.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.320
Sorry, it's like so late.

29:45.320 --> 29:48.240
It's been a long day.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.240
Okay.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.040
Beck, get them an energy drink.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.040
You got it.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.200
Oh, energy drink?

29:53.200 --> 29:54.200
Give me one.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.200
Oh, okay.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.200
Yeah.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.200
I love energy drink.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.200
Me too.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.200
Go, go, go.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.200
Well, where are the...

30:01.200 --> 30:06.200
Where the fuck is he going next?

30:06.200 --> 30:07.320
I don't know.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.320
Do you see any rhyme or reason to it?

30:09.320 --> 30:10.320
Can we...

30:10.320 --> 30:11.760
Let's maybe start plotting them out.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.920
Like where are they ending up?

30:13.920 --> 30:14.920
Okay.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.920
Maybe it's a drawing.

30:16.920 --> 30:17.920
Maybe it's a symbol.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.880
A good old fashioned connect the dots.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.480
We saw symbols in the pit.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.560
Maybe that's it.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.800
Let's Google map them.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.080
Let's Google map them.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.080
Let's Google map them.

30:29.080 --> 30:34.720
Wait, Stevie, have any of the nerds in your phone started doing that already?

30:34.720 --> 30:36.560
Oh, that's really smart.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.240
Yeah, those Reddit tweets have been breaking a lot of shit on us.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.600
Yeah, they could move this forward like so fast.

30:42.600 --> 30:48.120
Can you talk to them?

30:48.120 --> 30:51.200
Can you talk to them?

30:51.200 --> 30:53.000
I feel like sometimes everything I say is wrong.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.240
Oh, no, no, no.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.240
I didn't mean like...

30:55.240 --> 30:56.240
No, no.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.240
No, it's good.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.240
I can't.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.240
I can't ask.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.200
And they're just like going through the phone and...

31:02.200 --> 31:06.560
Beck says, I'll help you out and Beck starts doing it too because that's where he lives

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
is online.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.080
He's already had burner accounts that he can start putting stuff in different forms.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.600
Do you have the stats to back that up?

31:12.600 --> 31:13.840
I think I do.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.040
I've got computer science if you want to use that.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.800
Yeah, that's what I use to scroll Reddit.

31:17.800 --> 31:18.800
Hold on.

31:18.800 --> 31:19.800
Yeah, that's it.

31:19.800 --> 31:24.840
It does not take computer science to know how to troll on Reddit with backup accounts.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.000
What skill do you want me to roll?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.560
No, I'd like you to roll computer science, please.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.040
It's the only one that makes sense.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.040
Oh, fuck.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.040
Hold on.

31:32.040 --> 31:35.240
I think it intrinsically makes sense with Beck's character.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.960
Oh, that it's automatic?

31:37.960 --> 31:38.960
Yeah.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
What's your percent?

31:40.960 --> 31:44.440
I've got 60 in computer science and I rolled a seven.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.440
Okay.

31:45.440 --> 31:49.240
Then suspicious activity was detected on your accounts.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.360
You were upvoting.

31:50.360 --> 31:54.320
It was clear that you were upvoting from the same like ISP on your multiple accounts.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.520
God, I'm out of practice.

31:55.520 --> 32:02.440
Julius pulls his phone out, but can't figure out how to navigate off of the leg day subreddit.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.340
So he just puts it back.

32:04.340 --> 32:07.520
He doesn't want to leave that page anyway.

32:07.520 --> 32:09.920
No one on there is talking about it?

32:09.920 --> 32:12.800
He scrolls through a few scrolls.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
Does he see anything?

32:13.800 --> 32:14.800
What?

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
Roll computer science?

32:15.800 --> 32:19.400
I have zero.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.920
The baseline is zero?

32:20.920 --> 32:21.920
Yeah.

32:21.920 --> 32:27.560
I have U10 that's like giving Beck a 70, so I can't do that.

32:27.560 --> 32:31.400
No, you can do that.

32:31.400 --> 32:38.600
The only post he sees is the title is like, did a whole lot of leg workouts today.

32:38.600 --> 32:42.400
It's spelled H-O-L-E.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.120
And everybody gets what he's talking about.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.800
So it's the highest upvoted on the page right now.

32:47.800 --> 32:52.880
The weightlifter is spreading whole while showing off thighs.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.920
So there's no map made or what?

32:55.920 --> 32:56.920
Yeah.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.920
How long is it going to take these nerds?

33:00.920 --> 33:01.920
I don't know.

33:01.920 --> 33:07.120
Like, I mean, they don't always crack everything like right away and even if they do, it might

33:07.120 --> 33:13.200
just be like in some lost thread somewhere that we haven't found, but I'll keep looking.

33:13.200 --> 33:18.680
I mean, just tell me where the points are and I got a map here somewhere probably.

33:18.680 --> 33:19.680
Okay.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.680
Let's do this.

33:20.680 --> 33:25.640
Julius goes upstairs and finds just like a, he never hung it up on the wall, but like

33:25.640 --> 33:35.480
a big map as art, not huge, like that Luke is holding his hands about two feet apart.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.160
It's two feet map, two foot map.

33:38.160 --> 33:44.200
Is a SIGINT specifically technology or could it be used to like decipher a cipher?

33:44.200 --> 33:45.200
It's absolutely.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.200
It's for deciphering.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.200
Specifically.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.200
For deciphering.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.200
Yeah.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.200
If we lay out the plots, can I use a SIGINT roll?

33:50.200 --> 33:51.200
Yeah.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.200
Me too.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.200
All right.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.200
Let's roll those SIGINTs boys.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
Oh.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.200
Oh fuck.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.200
I got an 86.

33:57.200 --> 33:58.200
I got a 92.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.200
Oh my God.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.200
Damn.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.200
I have a 70.

34:01.200 --> 34:07.200
I thought that was a 69 at first.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.240
Oh yeah.

34:08.240 --> 34:09.240
Joe, you're reading it wrong.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.240
You got a 69.

34:11.240 --> 34:12.240
Damn.

34:12.240 --> 34:13.240
Fuck.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.240
God.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.400
It's just like dots on a map.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.400
It does.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.680
It just looks like dots on a map.

34:17.680 --> 34:22.120
Well, I think if we maybe give these Reddit nerds some time while we prepare in other

34:22.120 --> 34:24.720
ways, maybe that will come to fruition for us.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.520
Have we tried calling your brother?

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
Uh, yeah.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.520
Hmm.

34:28.520 --> 34:36.520
Where'd he say he was?

34:36.960 --> 34:42.320
They hold their phone up and it's like outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing call, outgoing

34:42.320 --> 34:44.200
call, outgoing call, outgoing call.

34:44.200 --> 34:50.200
Cal leans over the back and goes, rent free.

34:50.200 --> 34:56.680
Stevie, when you like let him loose, did he like say anything?

34:56.680 --> 35:02.480
Did he seem like he was himself at first or like, did he communicate with you at all?

35:02.480 --> 35:05.280
He was, he was really, he was really wet.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.960
And he looked afraid.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.920
He looked afraid.

35:09.920 --> 35:15.560
Wet and afraid was the alternative title of this podcast.

35:15.560 --> 35:26.320
I've just felt this presence just emanate like through my mind and it was so scared.

35:26.320 --> 35:32.760
And I, I just, I wanted to show that I was on its side and I wanted to, I thought that

35:32.760 --> 35:39.560
if I could prove that I wasn't a threat, you know, like, I don't know, I, when he,

35:39.560 --> 35:43.200
when he physically like went away from you, was he running?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.160
Like, was he like scared?

35:45.160 --> 35:46.160
Scared?

35:46.160 --> 35:56.160
No, no, we walked out the door and he just looked back at me and in his eyes it looked

35:56.160 --> 35:57.880
like he, it looked like he was there.

35:57.880 --> 36:08.520
It looked like, it looked like Greg and just like a single tear rolled down his face and

36:08.520 --> 36:12.080
then he wasn't, rolled for what?

36:12.080 --> 36:22.320
Greg, yeah, I just, I'm sopping wet, just walked away.

36:22.320 --> 36:29.640
I called after him and I ran for him and I, I tried to grab onto him and push me off.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.480
It wasn't, it wasn't him, it wasn't him anymore.

36:33.480 --> 36:39.000
It wasn't, just kept walking.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.040
Stevie did Greg display an interest in wet smooth holes from a young age?

36:45.040 --> 36:55.600
What, why, why is everyone giggling?

36:55.600 --> 36:59.600
Well I personally think it was because of the pussy joke.

36:59.600 --> 37:04.400
Oh, Cal turns very red.

37:04.400 --> 37:12.440
This is, this is quite a lot and this whole time X has been just on her phone typing stuff,

37:12.440 --> 37:14.120
swiping and such.

37:14.120 --> 37:19.020
When we saw you at the bridge hole, were you, was that your first hole?

37:19.020 --> 37:20.020
You saw her at the bridge?

37:20.020 --> 37:21.520
Yeah, at the bridge hole.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.440
You didn't tell me about the bridge hole.

37:23.440 --> 37:30.280
Yes, I ran into your compatriots so we hadn't agreed whether you were going to bring them

37:30.280 --> 37:39.000
in or not and yes, that was my, my first of these incidences of the holes.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.800
Is it like coming up in your, on your guys's radar?

37:41.800 --> 37:46.120
Yeah, it seems like maybe if you're investigating that first hole you'd be investigating the

37:46.120 --> 37:47.120
subsequent holes.

37:47.120 --> 37:52.800
Yes, I'm being told that the holes are being attended to.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.360
But you and Julius were here before the hole.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.840
What were you here doing?

37:56.840 --> 37:57.840
Hey, yeah.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.800
Well, that Godel technology that you saw.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.800
Yeah.

38:01.800 --> 38:02.800
Yeah.

38:02.800 --> 38:11.560
Yeah, we would like to just like make the world aware that it's being used and his whole

38:11.560 --> 38:14.280
situation.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.760
Beck is pointing at the device.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.760
You have one.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.760
Yeah.

38:19.760 --> 38:24.840
I mean, we got them, they got them, but it's kind of like the government's scared to like

38:24.840 --> 38:29.640
tell people so they want to expose it so that they're the bad guys that gets everybody scared

38:29.640 --> 38:32.320
and then we can just make it normal.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.760
What's, what's bad about these?

38:34.760 --> 38:35.760
In my mind?

38:35.760 --> 38:36.760
Uh, nothing.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.760
Do you feel that?

38:37.760 --> 38:38.760
Yeah.

38:38.760 --> 38:39.760
Okay.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.800
Why does Godel have to be the bad guy?

38:41.800 --> 38:45.800
Oh, because you know, some people are like, don't be God.

38:45.800 --> 38:51.160
And so they can, if, Hey, if it's all good stuff, then Godel, that's good.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.840
If it's all bad stuff, then it's not us.

38:53.840 --> 38:54.840
That's good.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.520
It turns out it's good.

38:56.520 --> 38:57.520
Everybody.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.520
It's good for everybody.

38:58.520 --> 39:01.600
Cow's looking at X. What power is this?

39:01.600 --> 39:08.760
Oh, um, well, we're not like, like just hope.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.660
Like the humanity's hope.

39:10.660 --> 39:14.480
He looks at X to see if that was a good answer or not.

39:14.480 --> 39:19.400
She's just kind of looking back at you with like, uh, as good as any.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.560
How do you get that hope out of a human?

39:21.560 --> 39:26.800
Oh no, no, it's, um, nothing so sinister.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.680
We just don't know.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.880
But do you suspect?

39:30.880 --> 39:34.440
Well, Otherwise, what's wrong with the skin graft

39:34.440 --> 39:35.440
2000?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.320
It seems like a miracle technology.

39:37.440 --> 39:43.640
Godel wouldn't be a bad guy if he released this, unless there's something sinister about

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
it.

39:44.640 --> 39:50.400
Well, Nope, I guess you're wrong about that.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.400
Can I come at that?

39:53.400 --> 39:54.400
Yeah.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.400
94.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
39.

39:56.400 --> 40:02.280
Cow's like, well, I have been wrong before.

40:02.280 --> 40:09.120
Well, it's like, you know how you feel right now, the explanation that like, we don't know

40:09.120 --> 40:13.120
and how that makes you feel, but that's going to be everybody.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.440
And they're going to be mad about that.

40:15.440 --> 40:19.220
I'm still a little confused, like how you have one, is he like a military contractor

40:19.220 --> 40:21.920
and you got a hold of their part of their contract?

40:21.920 --> 40:26.120
Did the Godels make one specifically for one for the military?

40:26.120 --> 40:28.000
How mass produced are these things?

40:28.000 --> 40:31.680
Those are all big questions, Mr. Wilder.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.240
Yeah, I would say that, you know what you're talking about.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
Thanks.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.240
Absolutely.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
Yeah.

40:39.240 --> 40:45.920
I, uh, I, I've got this one and, uh, I do know that if I, if something were to happen

40:45.920 --> 40:49.840
to it, I probably wouldn't, you know, it'd be hard to get a replacement.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.760
You know what I mean?

40:51.760 --> 40:56.400
Do you have other stuff that Godels have engineered?

40:56.440 --> 41:03.840
Dr. Murray is looking at X and X is looking at Dr. Murray and X kind of gives it a reluctant

41:03.840 --> 41:11.720
nod and Dr. Murray is like, Oh yeah, like, like what?

41:11.720 --> 41:19.000
I mean, I don't, I don't have the, um, necessarily the, uh, authorization to get into it, but,

41:19.400 --> 41:29.080
I don't want to undersell you, but if you can imagine it, it can possibly be done now.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.640
Like a machine that makes cappuccinos on demand?

41:31.640 --> 41:32.640
Done.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.640
Well, we already did.

41:33.640 --> 41:34.640
Yes.

41:34.640 --> 41:39.640
We already, uh, yeah, we already did that on all of the NPCs.

41:39.640 --> 41:40.640
Okay.

41:40.640 --> 41:41.640
Cow's like, yeah.

41:41.640 --> 41:42.640
Yeah.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.640
Beck.

41:43.640 --> 41:48.640
I mean, we had one in the lobby for quite a while until, well, you remember, you kind

41:48.680 --> 41:50.440
of knocked it over with your camera.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.440
Oh, it scared me.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
Yeah.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.440
Yeah.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
Yeah.

41:55.440 --> 42:03.080
I told you there's no, yes.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.080
And I told you there's nothing to fear.

42:05.080 --> 42:10.080
It's just a cappuccino maker.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.080
All right.

42:12.080 --> 42:16.120
Well, uh, you said anything I could think of, it's what I think everyone knows what I can

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
think of.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.560
Another one of those.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.560
No, no, no, no, no.

42:20.560 --> 42:27.560
Dr. Murray X, can we have Dr. Murray's thing for our dangerous mission to find God?

42:27.560 --> 42:29.760
You seem to have plenty.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.360
You cannot fucking touch my, uh, my device here.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.760
Seems like you answer to her.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.760
Yes.

42:35.760 --> 42:36.760
Uh, you cannot have her device.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.760
Uh, Dr. Murray, that will be all.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.760
Thank you so much for your time.

42:40.760 --> 42:46.600
Can I human that to see if she's lying and that we can have it?

42:47.080 --> 42:55.080
I want to try a persuade role X please.

42:55.080 --> 43:01.080
91 critical success.

43:01.080 --> 43:05.080
Dr. Murray, it's always a pleasure.

43:05.080 --> 43:06.080
Yeah.

43:06.080 --> 43:07.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.080
Of course.

43:08.080 --> 43:12.080
I hope you're feeling better and, uh, everyone, uh, feel good and stuff.

43:12.560 --> 43:14.560
Don't, don't have any need for me.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.560
Okay.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.160
But if you do, I'll be just right around for you.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.160
If we do.

43:19.160 --> 43:20.160
Do you have a card?

43:20.160 --> 43:24.280
Is there a way to get ahold of you?

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
And she shuts the door.

43:25.280 --> 43:30.240
She opens the door real quick and she goes, Oh, I forgot to tell you that it was a crazy

43:30.240 --> 43:31.240
fucking night.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.240
Last night.

43:32.240 --> 43:39.320
I found a parallel.

43:39.560 --> 43:52.400
A pair of legs, lambs, lobsters, a paradise.

43:52.400 --> 43:58.800
You found a paradise where, where was the paradise?

43:58.800 --> 43:59.800
What is happening?

43:59.800 --> 44:01.720
Dr. Murray, did you forget to tell us anything?

44:01.720 --> 44:02.720
She's having a stroke.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.720
She's just standing there.

44:03.720 --> 44:06.000
I told you they're weird.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.100
It's like she came back to ask for help.

44:09.880 --> 44:10.880
You couldn't get it out.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.880
She's just standing there.

44:11.880 --> 44:12.880
Stuck frozen.

44:12.880 --> 44:15.980
Hey Julius, could I have my makeup kit back?

44:15.980 --> 44:19.780
Oh, he never looked at his face, but he, he gives it back.

44:19.780 --> 44:22.780
Cow gives it like a quick kiss and is like, how are you doing old girl?

44:22.780 --> 44:26.780
And slips it in his coat pocket.

44:26.780 --> 44:27.780
Legs.

44:32.780 --> 44:33.780
What?

44:33.780 --> 44:38.340
That's the, that's the first thing I said, and not even just one, but two, can we talk

44:38.340 --> 44:44.700
about how you didn't say anything for like 10 minutes, two sets of legs and a top half.

44:44.700 --> 44:45.700
It was nuts.

44:45.700 --> 44:46.700
It was a woman.

44:46.700 --> 44:51.540
I, it was a, no, I mean, obviously not one of the halves, a whole, whole woman had a

44:51.540 --> 44:53.060
wild story in this whole time.

44:53.060 --> 44:57.660
She's just poking her head out back into the door of Julius and X's place.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.980
I, yeah, it was a, it was last night.

44:59.980 --> 45:02.020
It was absolutely naughty.

45:02.020 --> 45:04.820
Total cleanup over at the zeitgeist.

45:04.820 --> 45:06.300
There was people in half.

45:06.300 --> 45:07.300
Yeah.

45:08.260 --> 45:13.020
Like two bottom halves and one top half is very weird.

45:13.020 --> 45:14.020
It was very strange.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.020
Did they see what happened?

45:15.020 --> 45:18.420
Well, I mean, there was a woman there and she was like all sorts of wild.

45:18.420 --> 45:21.120
I won't say a name, but what was her name?

45:21.120 --> 45:23.780
She was a fine girl.

45:23.780 --> 45:25.580
And tell us the initials.

45:25.580 --> 45:28.060
She was telling me about this dirty girl.

45:28.060 --> 45:34.580
Apparently like went into another person, like inside the tum tum of another person

45:34.580 --> 45:41.140
is what she got eaten, like, but like in, like sucked into the belly or whatever.

45:41.140 --> 45:45.500
And then like somebody else was punched in half, uh, it's happened at the bar.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
Yeah.

45:46.500 --> 45:47.500
No, no, no.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
At the zeitgeist.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.500
Oh shit.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.820
What was the bar called?

45:50.820 --> 45:51.820
The printing press.

45:51.820 --> 45:52.820
No, that's the drink.

45:52.820 --> 45:53.820
Where are we?

45:53.820 --> 45:54.820
We're at bucky kid's bar.

45:54.820 --> 45:55.820
No, the first bar.

45:55.820 --> 45:56.820
The foundry.

45:56.820 --> 45:57.820
The foundry.

45:57.820 --> 45:58.820
Sorry.

45:58.820 --> 45:59.820
I was confused.

45:59.820 --> 46:03.700
The zeitgeist is the city's famous secret spot to me.

46:03.700 --> 46:04.700
Space Needle.

46:04.700 --> 46:05.700
I think you just call them Space Needles.

46:05.700 --> 46:08.420
They don't have another name, do they?

46:08.420 --> 46:13.380
Um, not that I know of, I think it's just called a small Space Needle.

46:13.380 --> 46:18.180
Well, last time I was up there, it didn't look like anybody been up there in forever.

46:18.180 --> 46:19.180
Was it inside?

46:19.180 --> 46:21.820
No, it was actually down on the ground.

46:21.820 --> 46:22.860
Huh?

46:22.860 --> 46:24.580
It's our city's famous spire.

46:24.580 --> 46:29.260
Oh, yes, of course a spire.

46:29.260 --> 46:33.820
My uh, my wife and I had our first date in the rotating restaurant.

46:33.820 --> 46:37.020
Damn, you are old.

46:37.020 --> 46:40.420
Yes, Julius.

46:40.420 --> 46:43.340
Damn it.

46:43.340 --> 46:47.740
Yes, I am.

46:47.740 --> 46:50.580
Was it cool or was it like gimmicky?

46:50.580 --> 46:55.060
Cal's eyes get misty and he like looks into the distance and a single tear rolls down

46:55.060 --> 46:58.620
his cheek and he says, it was very cool.

46:58.620 --> 47:04.820
Yeah, Julius honestly thought it was probably gimmicky until he just heard that and now

47:04.820 --> 47:11.500
he longs to have been able to go to the rotating restaurant.

47:11.500 --> 47:12.500
Top class.

47:12.500 --> 47:17.740
So, like, did you fix them or clean them up?

47:17.740 --> 47:18.740
What happened?

47:18.740 --> 47:20.580
Well, I didn't fix the halfs, no.

47:20.580 --> 47:21.580
Does that thing?

47:21.580 --> 47:23.500
Yeah, would it fix a half?

47:23.500 --> 47:25.500
How much can that thing grow back?

47:25.500 --> 47:29.140
Oh, not like a half on half, although.

47:29.140 --> 47:33.340
And she gets a weird look in her eye and she goes, actually, gotta go and slams the door

47:33.340 --> 47:34.340
open.

47:34.340 --> 47:40.420
Son of a bitch, that thing rehaves halves.

47:40.420 --> 47:41.420
What the?

47:41.420 --> 47:45.340
That thing refools halves.

47:45.340 --> 47:51.540
I mean, I know we're focused on finding God, but like we drew the dots and it's nothing.

47:51.540 --> 47:53.300
What if we go check out the halves?

47:53.300 --> 47:54.980
I think we should go.

47:54.980 --> 47:59.780
I mean, we got two days until we can run the scratch fixer 2000 or what our skin graft

47:59.780 --> 48:00.780
2000.

48:00.780 --> 48:04.060
We've got the nerds working on this on the, on the, on the read it.

48:04.060 --> 48:05.060
Yeah.

48:05.060 --> 48:10.460
And then, I mean, we also got, we got other programmers out there fixing the holes or

48:10.460 --> 48:12.100
something, right X?

48:12.100 --> 48:13.100
Yes.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.100
Let's go.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.100
We can get a new news story about the halves.

48:15.100 --> 48:16.100
Yeah.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.900
We can make a whole like other story, the B block.

48:18.900 --> 48:23.220
I mean, a dirty girl going into someone's belly.

48:23.220 --> 48:28.660
It sounds like it's related to our whole thing.

48:28.660 --> 48:34.100
The story can be called like, uh, it's like half, but it's like one over Z cause it happened

48:34.100 --> 48:35.100
at the zeitgeist.

48:35.100 --> 48:36.100
Sure.

48:36.100 --> 48:37.100
Yeah.

48:37.100 --> 48:38.100
We'll think about that.

48:38.100 --> 48:42.100
We'll get the graphic department on there.

48:42.100 --> 48:43.100
Yeah.

48:43.100 --> 48:44.100
Yeah.

48:44.100 --> 48:45.100
The two, that's amazing.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.260
Z, I get it.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.260
And it's halves.

48:48.260 --> 48:49.260
Okay.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.260
Yeah.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.260
I was going to be the producer one day.

48:51.260 --> 48:52.260
Yeah.

48:52.300 --> 48:53.300
I was going to be the producer.

48:53.300 --> 48:54.300
You're a pretty good producer.

48:54.300 --> 48:58.640
X, do you know anything about these halves?

48:58.640 --> 49:06.680
Not anything exactly about the halves, but Julius, you did tell me about someone else

49:06.680 --> 49:12.620
claiming that someone was trying to get into someone else's stomach.

49:12.620 --> 49:15.340
Their names were like silver and gold or something.

49:15.340 --> 49:16.340
Yeah.

49:16.340 --> 49:19.000
And there was, uh, beer, uh, something to do with beer involved.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
I remember that.

49:20.000 --> 49:24.120
It's only been a few weeks, but it feels like almost a year ago.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.340
Yeah.

49:25.340 --> 49:28.040
I wonder whatever happened with that.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.220
Google it Julius.

49:29.220 --> 49:30.760
Google Kaylee silver.

49:30.760 --> 49:31.760
Yeah.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.760
When you Google Kaylee silver.

49:32.760 --> 49:34.600
Well, I mean, I'll need some help here.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.160
How long do these things take to go to trial?

49:37.160 --> 49:38.160
Oh, to trial?

49:38.160 --> 49:39.160
Depends.

49:39.160 --> 49:45.360
How about I just finished up.

49:45.360 --> 49:47.080
Cal's reading the article over your shoulder.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.840
He's like, wow, that was fast.

49:49.840 --> 49:55.080
If there's one thing about the city, it's the kind of lack of crazy crime.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.080
That's usually our thing.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.080
Yeah.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.080
Swift justice.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.080
What?

49:59.080 --> 50:00.080
Yeah.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.640
What do I find about Kaylee silver?

50:03.640 --> 50:09.040
I guess let's, uh, let's roll on whether or not she's had her just 50 50.

50:09.040 --> 50:10.040
Yeah.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.040
What do I want?

50:11.040 --> 50:12.040
High or low?

50:12.040 --> 50:13.040
Well, it depends if you roll low.

50:13.040 --> 50:18.080
We'll say that she already had her court date and if you roll high, it hasn't happened yet.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.080
Yep.

50:19.320 --> 50:20.320
Yeah.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
Rolled high.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.080
So hasn't happened yet.

50:23.080 --> 50:25.640
Hasn't happened yet, which is much more realistic.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
Yeah.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.520
She is currently, uh, in the system has not posted bail.

50:29.520 --> 50:32.640
There was like a crazy high bail posts for someone.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.640
Sure.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.640
Sure.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.640
For doing that.

50:35.640 --> 50:38.560
If you guys want it, we, we, we could maybe like set up an interview with her.

50:38.560 --> 50:39.560
Yeah.

50:39.560 --> 50:44.400
Let's, I'd like to go check out Z and see if, I mean, if that fucking lady is the one

50:44.400 --> 50:47.240
that found it, she didn't clean them up probably.

50:47.240 --> 50:48.240
Yeah.

50:48.400 --> 50:49.400
Yeah.

50:49.400 --> 50:50.400
They might still be there.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.400
She might've missed a half or two.

50:52.400 --> 50:56.880
We should probably go check Z out first and then, uh, then maybe, maybe Kaylee can help

50:56.880 --> 50:58.680
us fill in any gaps.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.680
Yeah.

50:59.680 --> 51:02.500
Can news away.

51:02.500 --> 51:03.500
Pleasure meeting you X.

51:03.500 --> 51:09.120
The pleasure was, and she looks at Cal Colorado, all mine.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.880
Lady I used to want to ask you out, but now you scare me.

51:11.880 --> 51:13.840
Good day.

51:13.880 --> 51:20.000
On the way out of the house, uh, Julius like, um, stops and looks and it's the only like

51:20.000 --> 51:24.120
picture in the house, the only piece of artwork or anything.

51:24.120 --> 51:30.520
And it's just a framed picture of him and this guy with like long black stringy hair

51:30.520 --> 51:35.000
and like three long whiskers on his chin.

51:35.000 --> 51:41.440
And he looks at it and he kind of a bittersweet like head nod and then walks out of the house.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.800
Hey Julius, who's that creepy guy?

51:43.800 --> 51:49.800
Julius, uh, with that question, literally doesn't know what you're talking about.

52:14.800 --> 52:21.680
Well, there was that thing that happened on the other side of the city a few years ago,

52:21.680 --> 52:26.440
you know, with that crime Lord and his weird arena of death.

52:26.440 --> 52:28.840
That feels like it was hundreds of years ago to me.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.480
It was worked in the future.

52:30.480 --> 52:34.400
It was pre pandemic, which hasn't happened yet.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.600
Wait, this was 2022.

52:36.600 --> 52:37.600
Oh yeah.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.600
The big one hasn't happened yet.

52:39.600 --> 52:40.600
What?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
What?

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
What?

52:57.000 --> 52:58.800
I'm a big fan of eating those just raw.
