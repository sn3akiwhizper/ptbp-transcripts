WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
Well, here we are once again, folks.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.800
For the first time.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.960
Again, it's your favorite radio DJ

00:07.960 --> 00:12.080
from inner and outer space, Wolf the Dog.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.580
And where and when the fuck am I?

00:15.580 --> 00:17.120
Hold on.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.800
It smells like East Coast.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.700
Let me check my local dimension time.

00:23.700 --> 00:28.180
It's 1937 and New Year's Eve.

00:28.220 --> 00:33.020
It's as if I have no control over what happens to me.

00:33.020 --> 00:37.520
Like someone is forcing me to play into the sick fantasy

00:37.520 --> 00:40.460
that's broadcast to all the world.

00:40.460 --> 00:45.060
But yeah, I guess we got a new Howlin' with Wolf or whatever.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.280
If these are even real.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.860
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jeff in Seattle,

00:50.860 --> 00:54.180
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending part.

00:54.180 --> 00:58.040
A simple and worthwhile use of any person's time.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.280
Jeff in Seattle writes,

01:00.280 --> 01:03.940
a shout out to my wonderful and adorable little brother,

01:03.940 --> 01:05.640
Chalky Boberson.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.360
May your D100s roll low and your D20s roll high.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.180
And a warning to Matias Black.

01:13.180 --> 01:16.680
Temporal manipulation never ends well.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.940
Don't gaze into dimensions that are not your own

01:19.940 --> 01:22.920
unless you want eyes looking back.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.920
Well, Jeff in Seattle, I have to say that temporal

01:26.920 --> 01:30.480
whatever you said seems pretty cool to me.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.840
Sometimes you gotta gaze into another dimension

01:33.840 --> 01:35.280
as a little treat.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.260
And sometimes you have to consume another dimension

01:39.260 --> 01:41.580
as a big ol' meal.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.740
If you wanna write up something for your Wolfie to how,

01:44.740 --> 01:47.280
tag at pretending part on the internet

01:47.280 --> 01:51.760
or write up a five star review on Apple podcasts.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.020
If you holler and let us know,

01:54.020 --> 01:57.160
you're sure to get the message that's deep in your soul

01:57.160 --> 02:00.220
to come out of this dirty old mouth hole.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.740
And if you're interested in doling out some dough

02:03.740 --> 02:05.800
to keep this show afloat,

02:05.800 --> 02:10.800
head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod

02:10.860 --> 02:14.740
for 29 bonus episodes.

02:14.740 --> 02:18.540
From Call of Cthulhu's classic scenario, The Haunting,

02:18.540 --> 02:21.700
to silly one page RPG sessions

02:21.700 --> 02:24.500
from our first season session zero

02:24.500 --> 02:28.920
to a currently 13 episode long mostly homebrew

02:28.920 --> 02:33.540
Delta Green campaign called The Creature Crew.

02:33.540 --> 02:38.540
All the links are in the show notes.

02:38.740 --> 02:42.080
Sound the alarm, but don't hit the snooze.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.980
Like a beast mode stiff arm, I'm quaking for the news.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.520
The first season of pretending to be people

02:49.520 --> 02:51.620
was a well-loved affair.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.980
So much so that it reached one million downloads.

02:55.980 --> 02:58.580
Thank you to everyone who contributed

02:58.580 --> 03:03.460
to this chunky number being so unbelievably large.

03:03.460 --> 03:06.420
Also, this episode right here kicks off

03:06.420 --> 03:11.420
the five episode guest run featuring Scott Dorward

03:11.420 --> 03:14.880
running a pulp Cthulhu scenario he wrote,

03:14.880 --> 03:18.520
which is called A New Age of Wonders.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.180
And call me Mrs. Liam Neeson

03:21.700 --> 03:26.700
if I am mistaken, but a new story deserves a new theme song

03:26.860 --> 03:29.840
and A New Age of Wonders deserves something

03:29.840 --> 03:31.980
full of pain and sorrow.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.300
It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.

03:37.060 --> 03:42.060
I didn't know a body could be hollow

03:43.860 --> 03:47.980
before its blood ran cold.

03:48.820 --> 03:53.820
I didn't know that the wind could sew

03:55.820 --> 04:00.820
through tissue and faggot bones.

04:03.220 --> 04:08.220
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

04:10.820 --> 04:15.820
Hollow when you said you were hollow.

04:17.980 --> 04:22.980
I thought you might be starving,

04:26.780 --> 04:31.780
so I gave you everything.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.660
Oh, actually I'm peaking a bit.

04:37.660 --> 04:38.980
Let me just drop my gain.

04:38.980 --> 04:42.260
Drop your gain to the floor, drop your gain to the floor.

04:42.260 --> 04:46.260
If your name is Scott Dorward, drop your gain to the floor.

04:46.260 --> 04:47.100
Nice.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.020
I've never had a hype man before.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.060
How'd you feel?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.140
I feel warm inside.

04:54.140 --> 04:55.140
I feel special.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.820
Welcome everyone to Pretending to Be People.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.420
We are here with a special guest today

05:05.420 --> 05:10.420
who is not only one of the good friends of Jackson Elias,

05:10.440 --> 05:14.380
not only the man at the helm of multiple games

05:14.380 --> 05:15.500
throughout the internet,

05:15.500 --> 05:18.340
but currently including running

05:18.340 --> 05:21.540
the Pulp Cthulhu campaign two-headed serpent

05:21.540 --> 05:24.060
for the podcast How We Roll,

05:24.060 --> 05:27.500
and just the all around incredible writer,

05:27.500 --> 05:31.540
tabletop master, wizard extraordinaire on the internet.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.380
Man with the golden voice.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.140
And the guy who I kind of wish was my grandpa,

05:35.140 --> 05:36.740
but haven't told him that to his face,

05:36.740 --> 05:38.020
it's Scott Dorward!

05:41.460 --> 05:42.500
Thank you very much.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.140
I'm never going to live up to that now.

05:44.740 --> 05:45.580
You know that.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.100
Well, Scott, you've already lived up to it

05:49.100 --> 05:51.060
because we had you on a while ago.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.260
Was it last year?

05:52.260 --> 05:54.100
Oh, maybe even longer than that.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.100
It was over a year ago at this point.

05:55.100 --> 05:55.940
Wow.

05:55.940 --> 05:56.780
Was it really?

05:56.780 --> 05:57.900
It was at the end of 2020, I think.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.100
Oh my God.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.980
And you ran Bleak Prospect for us,

06:01.980 --> 06:03.980
which is a Call of Cthulhu scenario

06:03.980 --> 06:07.740
that was written by a very talented writer

06:07.740 --> 06:09.660
for Call of Cthulhu.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.500
Who was that?

06:10.500 --> 06:11.340
Who was that?

06:11.340 --> 06:12.180
Oh, I forget.

06:14.180 --> 06:15.580
They're all the same, really.

06:15.580 --> 06:19.500
Well, you silly goose, it was written by you.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.340
Okay.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.500
I don't know why I've been so weird.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.340
Are you okay, man?

06:26.340 --> 06:27.980
It was, you wrote it.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.780
I wrote it a long time ago.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.100
I can't remember doing that.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.540
It might as well have been someone else.

06:35.540 --> 06:37.940
I've written so many things over the years.

06:38.540 --> 06:43.540
And honestly, it was one of my favorite

06:44.020 --> 06:46.300
role-playing experiences of my life.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.020
It's still some of the stuff I go back

06:48.020 --> 06:51.020
and listen to repeatedly just to hear it all again.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.940
I'll keep that in mind when I'm getting excited

06:52.940 --> 06:54.980
about the numbers, that it's just Joe.

06:54.980 --> 06:55.820
Yeah.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.140
So if you're listening to this

06:58.140 --> 06:59.380
and you haven't listened to that,

06:59.380 --> 07:02.260
Scott does an incredible job running Bleak Prospect

07:02.260 --> 07:03.620
for the four of us.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.460
And that was actually, that was a really wild time

07:06.500 --> 07:11.500
because Scott is in Europe and we are in North America,

07:12.100 --> 07:14.820
but at the time I was in Asia,

07:14.820 --> 07:17.460
so we were recording across three continents.

07:17.460 --> 07:18.300
Yeah.

07:18.300 --> 07:19.980
Yeah, that was like five minutes a day

07:19.980 --> 07:21.940
when we were all in sync, wasn't it?

07:21.940 --> 07:23.700
It really was.

07:23.700 --> 07:28.060
It took a long time to get on the same schedule.

07:28.060 --> 07:30.060
We really are a global podcast.

07:30.060 --> 07:33.780
Yeah, well, we're the international role-playing podcast.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.660
That's what everyone knows that.

07:35.700 --> 07:40.420
The Springfield, Missouri podcast is the international.

07:40.420 --> 07:43.180
We have a pretty big blip on the map of listeners

07:43.180 --> 07:44.340
in like South America.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.300
So recording in Asia, North America and Europe,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.900
having people in South America listen to it.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.700
We just got to get some of those researchers.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.580
Exactly, we got to get hit Antarctica.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.140
But today we're not playing Call of Cthulhu

07:59.140 --> 08:01.540
and today we are not playing Delta Green.

08:01.540 --> 08:05.100
And today we are playing.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.460
D&D first edition.

08:09.460 --> 08:10.300
Firewall.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.420
That was fun when Dungeons and Daddies did it.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.260
Oh, that was tight.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.500
But we're not doing that and we probably never will.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.740
Sorry, I haven't been talking much.

08:17.740 --> 08:18.860
I've just been trying to pretend

08:18.860 --> 08:21.460
like I wasn't working on my character sheet.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.380
Which is a different character sheet

08:25.380 --> 08:27.620
than we are used to using.

08:27.620 --> 08:29.740
I believe it's the first time

08:29.740 --> 08:32.540
that I personally have filled out a PC character sheet

08:32.540 --> 08:34.100
for Pulp Cthulhu.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.500
Pulp Cthulhu.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.060
Pulp Cthulhu.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.180
I've done a couple, mostly with you, Zach.

08:41.180 --> 08:42.780
You ran us through some back in the day.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.100
I've run it, I've never gotten to play it.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.060
I'm super fucking excited.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.100
I was able to run Waiting for the Hurricane

08:49.100 --> 08:50.900
from the back of the book,

08:50.900 --> 08:53.380
which was written by another good friend

08:53.380 --> 08:55.340
of Jackson Elias, Matt Sanderson.

08:55.340 --> 08:56.180
Yes.

08:56.180 --> 08:57.000
Is that right?

08:57.000 --> 08:57.840
He did.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.900
And of course we are wishing a speedy recovery to Matt.

09:01.900 --> 09:02.740
Yeah, thanks.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.500
It's been a scary month with Matt,

09:04.500 --> 09:08.180
but happily he's back home and on the road to recovery now.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.900
That's fantastic news, yeah.

09:09.900 --> 09:12.040
How's your, the last time we recorded

09:12.040 --> 09:13.820
you had like a tooth issue.

09:13.820 --> 09:14.940
Oh fuck, yeah.

09:14.940 --> 09:17.320
I ended up in hospital with that.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.160
Yeah.

09:18.160 --> 09:18.980
Oh my God.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.860
Yeah, I ended up having to have emergency surgery

09:21.860 --> 09:23.820
in part of my jaw removed.

09:23.820 --> 09:24.980
Oh man.

09:24.980 --> 09:25.820
Yikes.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.620
Yeah, I can't say I recommend it.

09:27.620 --> 09:28.460
No.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.660
Has it been a relatively smooth sailing

09:32.300 --> 09:33.500
after the surgery and stuff though?

09:33.500 --> 09:36.620
Yeah, I mean, the shape of my mouth still feels wrong,

09:36.620 --> 09:38.940
but apart from that, yes.

09:38.940 --> 09:39.760
Yeah.

09:39.760 --> 09:40.820
Oh, interesting.

09:40.820 --> 09:42.980
Did they let you keep the part that they pulled?

09:42.980 --> 09:46.340
I stupidly didn't think to ask because otherwise, yeah,

09:46.340 --> 09:49.260
I absolutely would have kept it in a jar at my desk.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.020
Scott, let's dive in.

09:54.020 --> 09:54.860
Let's do it.

09:54.860 --> 09:55.700
Okay.

09:55.700 --> 09:59.260
So this scenario is called A New Age of Wonders

09:59.260 --> 10:03.660
and it's published in issue three of the Blasphemous Tome,

10:03.660 --> 10:06.820
which is the fanzine that we do for the Patreon backers

10:06.820 --> 10:08.500
of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.180
Which you should all become because I personally

10:12.180 --> 10:15.020
am a patron of the Good Friends of Jackson Elias

10:15.020 --> 10:20.020
and the rewards that I reap are worth every fucking penny.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.180
Well, thank you, Zach.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.820
Yeah, I'll slip the check in the mail.

10:27.180 --> 10:28.200
Eight bucks.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.540
Every eight dollars counts.

10:32.660 --> 10:37.660
Oh God, eight dollars is big money in the RPG field.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.660
So this scenario takes place in 1937,

10:44.660 --> 10:48.100
particularly New Year's Eve, 1937.

10:48.100 --> 10:50.300
The player characters have all been invited,

10:50.300 --> 10:52.340
or at least they have managed to get themselves

10:52.340 --> 10:54.820
on the invitation list too,

10:54.820 --> 10:59.140
what promises to be the New Year's Eve party of the year.

10:59.140 --> 11:03.140
Or at least that's the way that the host has pitched it.

11:03.140 --> 11:06.900
The host is a man called Cicero Mordant.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.780
He comes from a moneyed background

11:09.780 --> 11:12.940
and his family is incredibly wealthy,

11:12.940 --> 11:15.740
but he himself has gone off

11:15.740 --> 11:17.180
in a somewhat different direction.

11:17.180 --> 11:21.380
He is an inventor, or at least a would be inventor.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.380
I mean, those of you who've kept up with his career

11:24.420 --> 11:27.580
know that he's enthusiastic,

11:27.580 --> 11:32.580
he's good at self-promotion, perhaps,

11:32.820 --> 11:34.340
and he certainly has the money

11:34.340 --> 11:37.540
to bring his inventions to the market.

11:37.540 --> 11:40.540
But really, fundamentally, he's a bit shit.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.020
I mean, some of the inventions

11:43.020 --> 11:44.300
that he's put out over the years

11:44.300 --> 11:47.220
are things like this self-playing violin,

11:47.220 --> 11:51.100
which promises to bring chamber music to every household,

11:51.100 --> 11:53.100
but it really just plays the same four bars

11:53.260 --> 11:54.420
over and over again,

11:54.420 --> 11:56.940
and goes out of tune in about five minutes.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.500
There was the electric hairnet,

11:59.500 --> 12:04.220
which promised to revolutionize home hairstyling.

12:04.220 --> 12:07.500
And there've been a number of unfortunate fires

12:07.500 --> 12:11.060
and the lawsuits are still in the courts at the moment.

12:11.060 --> 12:13.980
The less said of his radiant dentifries, the better.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.540
But this time he promises

12:18.540 --> 12:21.780
that he has got a magnificent new invention

12:21.780 --> 12:24.300
that he wants to show off to the world.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.540
And the launch of this invention

12:26.540 --> 12:29.460
is going to be this New Year's party

12:29.460 --> 12:33.500
at his family estate, The Mount, in rural Vermont.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.900
So let's, I'd say, introduce the player characters

12:36.900 --> 12:41.460
at this stage, and then we can just, I think,

12:41.460 --> 12:44.180
get you on the road to The Mount.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.940
So do you want to go round one by one

12:46.940 --> 12:48.620
to say who you're playing,

12:48.660 --> 12:53.660
and I think also why you're going to the party?

12:53.780 --> 12:57.980
My character, oh, give me that voice, baby, is Checkers.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.660
How old is Checkers?

13:01.660 --> 13:04.820
I'm a 19-year-old cult leader.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.980
I'm here, I'm going to the party

13:08.980 --> 13:12.140
to recruit some movie stars

13:12.140 --> 13:17.140
and high profile people for my cult, The Last Branch.

13:17.820 --> 13:22.820
And I'm Elden Ring, and fuck's sake.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.580
It's not my birth name.

13:28.580 --> 13:32.220
Elden Ring is my given name by myself.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.300
My given name for my family

13:34.300 --> 13:37.860
is none of my business, nor anyone else's.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.660
And I'm just very happy to be accompanying

13:41.660 --> 13:46.660
my dear Checkers to this wonderful New Year's Eve party

13:46.820 --> 13:51.100
and just helping him bring people to The Last Branch.

13:51.100 --> 13:55.500
Our goal is to get as many of the rich and powerful

13:55.500 --> 13:59.020
on our side today through the powers of persuasion

13:59.020 --> 14:02.300
and Checkers' deep and utter charisma.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.980
There are things at work in this world,

14:04.980 --> 14:07.220
forces beyond our control,

14:07.220 --> 14:11.820
and we look to control those forces.

14:11.820 --> 14:15.740
With money that we make from the cult.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.820
And Checkers, remember, the forces.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.820
Yeah, they are real.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.020
They certainly are.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.860
Are there really any stronger forces

14:23.860 --> 14:25.060
in the world than money?

14:27.620 --> 14:28.700
True love.

14:29.900 --> 14:30.740
Aww.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.700
That is a question that the Lafayette J. Honeycutt

14:36.700 --> 14:37.740
would like to get to know.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.340
Are there any more forces in the universe

14:40.340 --> 14:42.540
more powerful than love or money?

14:42.540 --> 14:44.180
And he studies that in depth.

14:44.180 --> 14:45.100
He's a scientist.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.940
Does he sound like that when he studies it?

14:46.940 --> 14:47.780
He doesn't.

14:47.780 --> 14:49.340
You'll hear his voice when he speaks.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.460
God damn it, Thomas.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.060
You're such a tease.

14:52.060 --> 14:52.900
Yep.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.620
He's gonna be showing up to this party in disguise.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.540
Why? Dressed as a turtle?

14:58.540 --> 15:00.420
Because he is a professional,

15:00.420 --> 15:03.220
yeah, he's gonna be dressed as a turtle.

15:03.220 --> 15:06.980
No, he's a professional rival of Cicero Mordent,

15:06.980 --> 15:09.220
and he wants to get a look at this invention,

15:09.220 --> 15:12.540
but he was not invited because he's on Mordent's shit list.

15:12.540 --> 15:15.300
Mordent has a very, very long shit list.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.780
And I'm playing Harvey Brewer.

15:19.780 --> 15:22.180
I'm here to make sure nobody gets too close

15:22.180 --> 15:25.380
to Mr. Lafayette J. Honeycutt here.

15:25.380 --> 15:26.380
He hired me.

15:26.380 --> 15:27.300
I'm gonna protect him.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.700
I told you, Harvey, tonight, it's,

15:29.700 --> 15:33.580
it's, oh shit, what was the cover name?

15:38.780 --> 15:40.180
You were gonna go with Harvey Brewer,

15:40.180 --> 15:42.780
but that's my name, so we can't use that one.

15:42.780 --> 15:43.620
That's correct.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.500
Is this your fumbling your disguise role in real life?

15:49.060 --> 15:49.900
More or less.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.380
What is your actual name?

15:53.380 --> 15:54.620
Lafayette J. Honeycutt.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.100
But tonight you are Honeyfette J. Lafayette.

16:01.540 --> 16:02.380
James Dean.

16:02.380 --> 16:06.980
No one famous has been named James Dean in 1937.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.940
I was gonna try to go for a mid-Atlantic,

16:10.620 --> 16:11.460
and I think I'm gonna go too much

16:11.460 --> 16:14.060
into copying your accent, Scott.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.060
Oh, can you please try?

16:19.140 --> 16:20.580
No, I'm not gonna.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.180
Do it.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.180
Do it, Scott, at Scott.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.620
Maybe after a couple sessions.

16:28.780 --> 16:29.780
Sessions.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.060
Session IPA.

16:32.900 --> 16:37.060
Oh, could we go puff some all this?

16:37.060 --> 16:38.100
After this episode.

16:39.100 --> 16:41.020
We gotta get the first episode down.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.900
So, like I say, you have all managed

16:44.900 --> 16:47.340
to somehow get hold of invitations

16:47.340 --> 16:49.180
to this New Year's Eve party,

16:49.180 --> 16:53.100
and you know that there has been transportation played on.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.660
All you have to do is get yourself

16:54.660 --> 16:57.860
to Montpellier in Vermont.

16:57.860 --> 16:58.700
There is a station there.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.060
Scott, sorry to interrupt.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.060
I'm so sorry.

17:01.060 --> 17:01.900
It's Montpelier.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.300
It's Montpelier, yeah.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.900
Montpelier, sorry, I went for the French pronunciation.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.180
We said it with such, like, a plum,

17:09.180 --> 17:11.860
and when I learned how to pronounce it,

17:11.860 --> 17:16.100
it was in Missouri, and we said Montpelier, Vermont.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.300
Well, that is how they say it.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.700
Montpelier, Montpelier.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.540
Montpelier, yeah.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.300
Montpelier, I shall say that again, then.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.340
Montpelier, Montpelier, right.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.740
It sounds like wrong when you say it.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.900
I bet Honeycutt does say Montpelier.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.180
Montpelier, Montpelier.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.860
I've got a beautiful 1932 bottle of Montpelier.

17:38.860 --> 17:43.060
Oh, God.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.780
Right, so yes, you know all you have to do

17:45.780 --> 17:49.220
is get yourself to Montpelier in rural Vermont,

17:49.220 --> 17:52.180
and then there will be transportation at the station

17:52.180 --> 17:54.540
that is laid on for you.

17:54.540 --> 17:58.900
And sure enough, when the train pulls in at the station,

17:58.900 --> 18:02.660
you can see that there are any number

18:02.700 --> 18:04.940
of well-dressed people

18:04.940 --> 18:07.980
who are obviously dressed up for this party.

18:07.980 --> 18:12.980
Men in full evening dress with heavy overcoats on,

18:13.300 --> 18:16.700
women in gowns, again, with furs over them

18:16.700 --> 18:20.140
to keep themselves warm, because it is cold.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.700
It's been snowing fairly heavily.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.060
There's storm clouds up in the sky,

18:25.060 --> 18:28.980
and you can see that the snow is falling already.

18:28.980 --> 18:32.300
But you can also see that outside the station,

18:32.820 --> 18:36.860
there are a number of vehicles lined up

18:36.860 --> 18:40.500
with uniformed chauffeurs who are there,

18:40.500 --> 18:42.100
a few of them holding up signs

18:42.100 --> 18:45.980
announcing that they're to take people to the mount.

18:45.980 --> 18:49.820
And after the usual moment's hesitation,

18:49.820 --> 18:53.540
people start flocking towards those vehicles.

18:54.660 --> 18:58.900
Shall we say, I mean, if you're happy with this,

18:58.900 --> 19:01.540
shall we say that the group of the four of you

19:01.580 --> 19:04.020
end up sharing the same car together?

19:04.020 --> 19:07.700
Because, you know, each car happily seats

19:07.700 --> 19:09.940
four passengers in the back.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.700
And there are enough people,

19:11.700 --> 19:14.740
guests who have arrived to the party,

19:14.740 --> 19:17.820
that they're pretty much filling up all the cars.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.740
One of the chauffeurs ushers the four of you

19:19.740 --> 19:22.340
into the back of one of these

19:22.340 --> 19:25.420
really quite fancy-looking limousines.

19:25.420 --> 19:29.860
Gentlemen, you are going to the mount, right?

19:29.860 --> 19:33.860
Yes, is this the correct way to go?

19:33.860 --> 19:35.460
Yes, yes, yes.

19:35.460 --> 19:38.580
Mr. Mordant has arranged for transportation

19:38.580 --> 19:40.460
for all his guests, please, please.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.380
How are you guys dressed?

19:42.380 --> 19:45.060
Harvey Brewer is a giant hulk of a man.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.300
He's like 6'8 and like 300 pounds, but it's like muscle.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.580
He's a big, strong, strong dude.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.300
And so he's wearing a tuxedo,

19:52.300 --> 19:55.220
but it's a little tight in all the right places.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.940
It's a little bit stretched almost,

19:57.940 --> 20:00.660
but he's pulling it off pretty okay.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.500
I imagine the suspension on the car

20:02.500 --> 20:04.380
just creaks as you get in.

20:04.380 --> 20:05.820
Yeah, exactly.

20:05.820 --> 20:09.380
Checkers is wearing like a cashmere three-piece suit.

20:09.380 --> 20:11.500
He's got like a full beard.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.580
Definitely trying to look older than he is,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.880
but he's dressed very fancifully.

20:17.460 --> 20:21.980
And Elden Ring is just wearing a very simple

20:21.980 --> 20:26.080
black pair of trousers and a white cotton shirt

20:26.080 --> 20:29.640
that is buttoned down, buttoned all the way to the top.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.160
And it has like a granddad collar,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.400
like an old school non-collar.

20:34.400 --> 20:39.400
Is that all you're wearing even in New Year's Eve in Vermont?

20:39.520 --> 20:44.520
Yes, and if anyone, if like the coach driver or whatever,

20:44.680 --> 20:48.400
like asks if I'm cold or need a fur or whatever, you know,

20:48.400 --> 20:50.720
he just kind of says like,

20:50.720 --> 20:52.400
no, the warmth is within me.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.240
Nice.

20:54.240 --> 20:58.080
I guess we'll find out how long that's going to last.

20:59.920 --> 21:04.040
So Lafayette is wearing a tuxedo

21:04.040 --> 21:07.540
that is as tailored as Harvey's is not.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.800
He, I mean, he looks fantastic.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.240
He looks like a 30s or 40s movie star

21:14.240 --> 21:18.080
and he's got this perfect like pencil thin mustache

21:18.080 --> 21:21.660
and a really dashing long tail coat, not a tail coat,

21:21.660 --> 21:26.020
but a long coat, it's winter in Vermont

21:26.020 --> 21:28.860
as Scott just tipped us off to.

21:32.340 --> 21:34.860
Quickly improvise a coat,

21:34.860 --> 21:36.660
which is the art of what we do here.

21:38.820 --> 21:41.240
He's carrying a very, very bulky briefcase.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.740
It's almost like a suitcase.

21:42.740 --> 21:45.860
It's way too large to be bringing

21:45.860 --> 21:47.700
to a New Year's Eve party,

21:47.700 --> 21:50.740
but he's got it tucked tightly under his arm

21:50.740 --> 21:52.980
and he's kind of looking suspiciously

21:52.980 --> 21:54.980
at the two people we've been paired up with.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.540
And he's like, Harvey, I don't like the look of these chaps.

21:58.540 --> 22:01.900
Upon hearing that Harvey is going to just mean mug

22:01.900 --> 22:04.140
these other two guys in the car with us.

22:04.140 --> 22:08.340
Yeah, I look at, you forgot my name?

22:08.340 --> 22:09.460
Elden Ring, yeah.

22:09.460 --> 22:14.460
I think we're all trying to forget your name, yeah.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.580
Checkers looks at Elden.

22:18.620 --> 22:20.940
Did he really just say that out loud?

22:20.940 --> 22:21.780
Looking-

22:21.780 --> 22:23.380
I said it so you couldn't hear.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.060
We're all in a car together.

22:25.060 --> 22:25.900
You have to get in a car.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.100
Thomas, I can hear you.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.540
I'm sitting right here.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.380
You've got headphones on.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.460
I have headphones on.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.540
These guys look nice.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.940
Do you think they'd be interested in our pitch?

22:36.940 --> 22:39.540
Yeah, I don't understand why anyone wouldn't be.

22:39.540 --> 22:43.740
As he's slowly just parting his super long black hair

22:43.740 --> 22:46.580
that is now like completely covering his face,

22:46.580 --> 22:48.380
he goes in with both hands

22:48.380 --> 22:51.780
and kind of makes a window for his eyes in between

22:51.780 --> 22:54.740
with a full middle part of this super long hair

22:54.740 --> 22:58.940
and just lets off the most unattractive smile

22:58.940 --> 23:00.980
at these two gentlemen.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.780
I'm imagining like the girl from the ring.

23:03.780 --> 23:04.620
Yeah.

23:04.620 --> 23:05.460
I'm imagining cousin Elden Ring.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.460
Elden Ring from the Addams family.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.740
Yeah, there you go.

23:08.740 --> 23:12.300
Lafayette is like sitting across from Elden

23:12.300 --> 23:15.980
and he's got his like very long, like elegant legs,

23:16.340 --> 23:17.740
like one folded over the other

23:17.740 --> 23:19.700
and you can see his foot is tapping

23:19.700 --> 23:22.980
just very, very anxiously and annoyedly,

23:22.980 --> 23:27.260
sort of half glaring, half just studying this creature

23:27.260 --> 23:28.580
that just sat down in front of him

23:28.580 --> 23:31.100
and parted its weird, greasy hair.

23:32.380 --> 23:34.940
Maybe ask him what his name is, Checkers.

23:38.820 --> 23:40.980
You're supposed to be our charisma person.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.380
Yeah, sorry.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.580
It's early in the morning here.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.900
Yeah, let's start that again.

23:48.260 --> 23:53.260
Hello, Checkers, this is Elden, gentlemen.

23:53.980 --> 23:54.900
It's nice to meet you.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.660
Have you two heard the kind and good news of Checkers?

23:58.660 --> 24:02.660
Yes, I think I have heard of what you lot get up to.

24:02.660 --> 24:05.540
I pull like a little pamphlet out of my coat

24:05.540 --> 24:07.100
and hand it over to Harley.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.580
I don't like your presence in my town.

24:09.580 --> 24:12.700
Well, this is not starting on a good foot.

24:12.700 --> 24:13.980
None savory element.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.860
Well, maybe we'll just leave each other

24:16.860 --> 24:21.140
to what we like to do and we won't discuss this in the car.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.620
As a man of science, yes, I'd prefer

24:23.620 --> 24:26.100
if we left your hokum here at the station.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.660
Checkers takes no offense to that

24:27.660 --> 24:31.460
because he does not believe in what he's selling at all.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.900
So he's just kind of like, fair enough.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.780
And this is why your cult only has two people in it.

24:39.780 --> 24:44.780
I'm just so sorry to say that I don't think

24:45.060 --> 24:46.820
I can leave it there.

24:46.820 --> 24:50.740
The world is bigger than your mind can comprehend, sir.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.580
Hey.

24:51.580 --> 24:52.780
He gets a kind of ride.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.820
Hey, shut up.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.180
He said he didn't want to hear about it.

24:57.180 --> 24:59.140
Now Harvey, now Harvey.

24:59.140 --> 25:02.100
He's beginning to speak on things of which he doesn't know.

25:02.100 --> 25:05.260
Yes, it is quite a big world.

25:05.260 --> 25:06.820
Elden, did you say your name was?

25:06.860 --> 25:09.780
Yeah, sir Elden Ring, I gave my name to myself.

25:09.780 --> 25:12.980
I explore some of those mysteries myself

25:12.980 --> 25:15.420
in ways I don't think either of you two would comprehend.

25:15.420 --> 25:17.420
What is it that you do, sir?

25:17.420 --> 25:18.700
All manner of things.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.180
Oh, right.

25:23.700 --> 25:28.700
Nothing, I'm a lazy socialite dilettante.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.340
Where is this accent going?

25:33.340 --> 25:35.900
I like it, I like it, it feels right.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.100
It feels right.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.700
If that's the case, then you really should read this.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.780
And I offer the pamphlet for my cult again.

25:43.700 --> 25:44.980
Right.

25:44.980 --> 25:48.300
He's suddenly like got a panic look and he's like,

25:48.300 --> 25:52.300
okay, yes, that is what I would do

25:52.300 --> 25:56.220
because I am a lazy gadabout.

25:58.780 --> 26:00.780
Right, you're exactly what we're looking for.

26:00.780 --> 26:01.620
Right.

26:01.620 --> 26:02.460
Are you rich?

26:02.460 --> 26:03.900
Yeah, yeah.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.020
Good, okay.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.820
It's a small fee to join,

26:06.820 --> 26:08.780
but we'll talk about it when we get to the point.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.500
The money is of no consequence

26:10.500 --> 26:12.220
when you're dealing in eternity.

26:12.220 --> 26:13.820
Give me your literature.

26:17.340 --> 26:18.700
He hands it over to him.

26:20.220 --> 26:23.500
He like reaches out with a handkerchief and grabs it.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.220
It's like a handwritten like pamphlet.

26:26.220 --> 26:28.860
What is this stain on?

26:30.580 --> 26:32.180
What is this stain?

26:33.900 --> 26:34.740
Thank you.

26:37.340 --> 26:39.820
Just read the pamphlet and you'll understand.

26:39.820 --> 26:42.380
It's magic.

26:42.380 --> 26:44.020
Lafayette leans over like,

26:45.020 --> 26:46.700
boy, that was a close one, Harvey.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.340
We're to, you know, one up old Mordent

26:49.340 --> 26:52.700
and unveil my invention and he pats the big box.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.460
Nice.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.340
Upstage him tonight.

26:56.340 --> 26:57.740
We can't reveal my identity.

26:57.740 --> 27:00.620
Did you, we're saying this to each other in confidence.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.700
Did you come up with a cover name yet?

27:02.740 --> 27:05.780
Oh God, I can't think of any name.

27:07.740 --> 27:10.060
Like when Billy actor's like,

27:11.620 --> 27:13.540
Billy actor's like, name a woman.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.780
Just like, Janine Garofalo.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.740
I also like to think that

27:23.740 --> 27:25.580
while you're having this conversation,

27:25.580 --> 27:29.300
supposedly in private, I mean, it's a small cab

27:29.300 --> 27:31.500
and I'd like to think the other two can just overhear

27:31.500 --> 27:34.300
every single fucking thing you're saying.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.580
So do you guys know Mr. Mordaunt?

27:36.580 --> 27:39.500
No, I'm lazy socialite, David Ellington.

27:42.220 --> 27:44.740
And I've never met Mr. Mordaunt.

27:44.740 --> 27:45.980
How'd you get invited?

27:45.980 --> 27:48.220
I'm a prominent socialite.

27:48.220 --> 27:49.420
And I'm his friend.

27:49.420 --> 27:50.260
Fair enough.

27:50.260 --> 27:51.220
This is my man.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.100
Yes.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.580
David and Harvey.

27:54.580 --> 27:55.420
Goliath.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.420
You said David and Goliath.

27:57.420 --> 28:02.420
Easy, you know what, that's really easy to remember.

28:04.820 --> 28:06.380
While you're having this conversation,

28:06.380 --> 28:10.060
the car is passing, first of all, through the town itself,

28:10.060 --> 28:11.380
which doesn't take very long.

28:11.380 --> 28:13.380
It's not a big town.

28:13.380 --> 28:17.780
And then heads off into, first of all, some country roads.

28:17.780 --> 28:22.020
You're moving through some fairly light woodland

28:22.020 --> 28:23.780
and then slightly thicker forest.

28:23.780 --> 28:28.100
And you can see that you're moving towards

28:28.100 --> 28:30.500
one of the big peaks around here.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.140
Those of you who know the area

28:32.140 --> 28:33.860
or who've looked at a map beforehand

28:33.860 --> 28:36.300
might realize that it's Mount Ellen.

28:36.300 --> 28:40.620
And you do seem to be moving towards the base of it.

28:40.620 --> 28:44.180
And at some point you move off onto a private road,

28:44.180 --> 28:47.260
which is much, much smaller.

28:47.260 --> 28:50.420
And the driver's having to slow down a fair bit

28:50.420 --> 28:53.620
at this stage because the snow's getting quite heavy.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.540
Not heavy enough that he's losing control of the vehicle,

28:56.540 --> 28:59.700
but visibility's suffering a little bit.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.940
But more importantly, he's obviously fighting a bit

29:01.940 --> 29:03.940
with traction on the road.

29:03.940 --> 29:07.900
But as you get closer, you can start to see...

29:09.020 --> 29:12.420
Well, first of all, have any of you been to the mount before

29:12.420 --> 29:14.220
or is this your first visit?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.020
For checkers, it's definitely the first visit.

29:16.020 --> 29:16.860
Same.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.820
I think it'd be Harvey's first visit for sure.

29:18.820 --> 29:22.380
Yeah, probably before Harvey started working for Lafayette.

29:22.380 --> 29:24.980
Lafayette had been and was kicked out.

29:24.980 --> 29:25.820
Oh yeah.

29:25.820 --> 29:26.660
Of course.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.500
Yeah.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.340
After he saw the debut of the self-playing violin

29:30.340 --> 29:31.860
at New Year's Eve, like 1933.

29:31.860 --> 29:34.340
Wait, did you unleash one of your own concepts

29:34.340 --> 29:35.180
that same night?

29:35.180 --> 29:36.660
I did.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.060
And what was that?

29:39.580 --> 29:41.180
What kind of jacket are you wearing?

29:41.180 --> 29:43.380
He just picked up a violin and started playing it

29:43.380 --> 29:44.220
and that was his invention.

29:44.220 --> 29:45.940
That would be exactly, yeah.

29:45.940 --> 29:48.700
What was that when you debuted the self-throwing tomato?

29:49.220 --> 29:54.220
No, I just fucked Borden's wife that night.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.460
He does not like me.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.660
When you were kicked out, you're like,

30:01.660 --> 30:03.780
you should invent a self-fucking you.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.340
My God.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.940
So that's what you've been working on ever since?

30:13.060 --> 30:14.980
That's what he's got in the suitcase.

30:16.460 --> 30:17.660
You don't know what he's been working on

30:17.660 --> 30:18.500
and then he packed the box again.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.300
I'm now horrified to find out what's in that suitcase.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.620
What's in the box is super rad.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.020
What's in the suitcase is going to carry

30:27.020 --> 30:29.020
a D6, D20 sand loss, I think.

30:30.740 --> 30:33.860
Yeah, for Morden, when he sees how fucking cool it is.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.140
What do you got in there?

30:39.140 --> 30:40.740
Yeah, that's a big box.

30:40.740 --> 30:41.820
Party supplies.

30:41.820 --> 30:43.140
Yeah, party supplies.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.780
What kind of party supplies?

30:44.780 --> 30:47.140
The kind that supply a party.

30:47.820 --> 30:48.900
That's what the rich do.

30:48.900 --> 30:49.740
Glassware?

30:49.740 --> 30:51.700
Probably silverware.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.060
You brought your own goblet?

30:53.060 --> 30:54.660
There's some silver in it, yes.

30:57.420 --> 30:58.940
I hope we're almost there.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.620
You are almost there.

31:01.620 --> 31:04.300
You've come over the ridge of a hill

31:04.300 --> 31:08.900
and onto a little plateau towards the base of the mountain.

31:08.900 --> 31:13.900
And yeah, there is the two-story colonial revival

31:13.900 --> 31:15.980
style mansion that is the mount

31:16.020 --> 31:18.380
with all its outbuildings around here.

31:18.380 --> 31:19.580
Before you get to it, though,

31:19.580 --> 31:23.620
you do pass by an odd-looking structure,

31:23.620 --> 31:26.740
which Nathaiad doesn't recognize

31:26.740 --> 31:29.580
as having been here the last time

31:29.580 --> 31:31.300
that you visited the mount.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.700
And it looks fairly incongruous.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.980
It's just built on the edge of the property.

31:36.980 --> 31:40.700
It looks initially like, you know,

31:40.700 --> 31:42.460
maybe the kind of lookout tower

31:42.500 --> 31:46.100
that you might get in the forest.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.820
Like on the forest moon of Indor?

31:49.420 --> 31:51.660
Yeah, like that maybe.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.700
Sorry, am I lagging again?

31:55.700 --> 31:57.140
It lagged pretty hard.

31:57.140 --> 31:59.340
We missed a little bit of the description of the tower.

31:59.340 --> 32:01.820
Sorry, I'll back up a bit then.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.380
So you notice this weird structure

32:04.380 --> 32:08.500
on the edge of the property that looks a bit like a tower,

32:08.500 --> 32:11.500
maybe a lookout tower that, you know,

32:11.540 --> 32:13.060
firefighters might use in a forest

32:13.060 --> 32:14.660
or forest rangers, rather.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.900
Like on the forest moon of Indor?

32:16.900 --> 32:18.220
Oh, fuck's sake.

32:23.060 --> 32:24.780
So you can see up atop the tower,

32:24.780 --> 32:28.140
there is what looks like a glass structure.

32:28.140 --> 32:30.140
I mean, I guess anyone who wants,

32:30.140 --> 32:31.700
if you want to give me a spot,

32:31.700 --> 32:34.100
hit and roll just to see what they can make out anymore.

32:34.100 --> 32:34.940
Oh boy.

32:38.620 --> 32:41.340
I passed a 10 on a base 25.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.300
That is a hard success.

32:43.300 --> 32:44.140
Nice.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.980
I failed my roll, an 82 on a 70.

32:46.980 --> 32:49.020
I got a 96.

32:49.020 --> 32:49.860
On a?

32:51.100 --> 32:53.180
On a 40.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.780
So that is actually a fumble.

32:54.780 --> 32:56.220
We'll get to you in a moment.

32:57.820 --> 32:58.700
I love that rule.

32:58.700 --> 33:02.620
So if it's over double your skill, it's a fumble?

33:02.620 --> 33:05.860
If you roll 96 to 100 and your skill's under 50,

33:05.860 --> 33:06.940
then it's a fumble.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.100
If your skill is over 50,

33:08.100 --> 33:10.420
you have to roll a double zero for it to be a fumble.

33:10.460 --> 33:11.620
Okay, sick.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.420
But what did Lafayette get?

33:13.420 --> 33:14.460
87.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.220
Okay, so I assume that's a failure.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.540
Do you have a 90 spot hidden?

33:18.540 --> 33:19.620
This is poor Cthulhu after all.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.260
No, I have a 51.

33:21.260 --> 33:24.420
So yeah, you do notice that there are some things

33:24.420 --> 33:26.740
sticking out of the top as well

33:26.740 --> 33:30.140
that look maybe like radio aerials.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.820
Yeah, I mean, there are all sorts

33:31.820 --> 33:34.380
of spiky protrusions coming out.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.040
Master Checkers, do you see those spiky guys

33:37.040 --> 33:39.300
coming out the top of that lookout tower?

33:39.340 --> 33:42.820
Checkers is like writing another pamphlet real quick

33:42.820 --> 33:45.940
and doesn't even pay attention to your question.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.260
Well, I think then on the fumble,

33:48.260 --> 33:50.660
then that's the point at which the car goes

33:50.660 --> 33:53.460
over a big bump in the road and you just end up scoring

33:53.460 --> 33:55.620
through all the magnificent pros that you've just written.

33:55.620 --> 33:56.460
Oh, man.

33:59.300 --> 34:03.140
Oh, another parchment down for the count, huh?

34:03.140 --> 34:06.580
Yeah, my pencil I was using pokes me in the eye

34:06.580 --> 34:09.620
and I'm like, just completely thrown off.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.900
Are you okay, Master?

34:10.900 --> 34:13.620
Just leave me alone for right now until we get to the party.

34:13.620 --> 34:18.620
He's like trying to be as like gentle and fixie as he can

34:19.780 --> 34:23.720
while still giving personal space to his favorite Checkers.

34:26.140 --> 34:28.620
Well, the car pulls up in the courtyard

34:28.620 --> 34:31.900
outside the main building and you can see

34:31.900 --> 34:33.420
that there were a number of other cars now

34:33.420 --> 34:35.980
that are parked there already.

34:36.260 --> 34:39.460
A few guests have got out and some of them

34:39.460 --> 34:42.260
are just going into the main entrance,

34:42.260 --> 34:44.580
a few are making their way over there.

34:44.580 --> 34:47.740
The house itself is largely lit up at the moment,

34:47.740 --> 34:50.180
there are lights on in most of the rooms,

34:50.180 --> 34:54.020
but the main activity seems to be coming

34:54.020 --> 34:57.260
from a room over on the left-hand side

34:57.260 --> 35:00.380
where you can see that there's a lot of bright light

35:00.380 --> 35:03.300
coming out from the windows, there's the sound

35:03.300 --> 35:06.420
of swing music playing rather loudly in there

35:06.420 --> 35:10.420
and through the windows, you can see activity going on.

35:10.420 --> 35:13.500
The other thing you can see is on the edifice

35:13.500 --> 35:18.500
of the building, just above the window,

35:18.580 --> 35:20.380
the front window of that room

35:20.380 --> 35:22.140
where all the activity is going on,

35:22.140 --> 35:26.100
there is what looks like another huge antenna

35:26.100 --> 35:28.220
just sticking out of the wall

35:28.220 --> 35:30.780
and some fairly thick cables coming down from it.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.740
Checkers, there's another one right there.

35:33.740 --> 35:37.140
He is writing another pamphlet and I'm paying attention.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.580
Checkers, oh, okay, yeah, no, okay.

35:41.580 --> 35:43.300
Antenna, sure, uh-huh.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.740
I'll tell you what, I mean,

35:44.740 --> 35:48.660
as Lafayette is actually a scientist,

35:48.660 --> 35:50.980
what is your scientific specialization?

35:50.980 --> 35:53.700
What scientific skills does Lafayette have?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.100
Engineering is his focus

35:55.100 --> 35:57.740
and mechanical, electrical, and computers.

35:57.740 --> 36:00.180
Yep, then engineering is perfect for this.

36:00.180 --> 36:02.180
If you want to give me an engineering role

36:02.180 --> 36:05.900
to see whether you can make sense of this at all.

36:08.020 --> 36:10.420
Yep, he passes 40 on a 90.

36:10.420 --> 36:12.540
Yeah, you look at this aerial

36:12.540 --> 36:15.060
and I mean, there's something weird about it.

36:15.060 --> 36:17.620
It's not a design you've encountered before.

36:17.620 --> 36:21.060
It doesn't look like an old radio aerial.

36:21.060 --> 36:22.700
There's a bit of a dish behind it

36:22.700 --> 36:25.540
and it looks like, I don't know,

36:25.540 --> 36:28.780
maybe it's designed to focus something,

36:28.780 --> 36:32.980
but yeah, there's something about it

36:32.980 --> 36:37.980
that looks really strange and maybe novel.

36:39.340 --> 36:42.660
Yeah, it's nothing like you've seen before.

36:42.660 --> 36:45.660
He kind of plays with his little pencil-thin mustache

36:45.660 --> 36:49.100
and he's like, what are you scheming at, Moldent?

36:49.100 --> 36:52.420
Right behind you is Elden Ring

36:52.420 --> 36:54.380
and he just like whispers in your ear

36:54.380 --> 36:56.580
and he's like, what do you think it is?

36:56.580 --> 36:59.460
He reflexively like elbows back.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.900
I have a size 40, so I think you like elbow back

37:04.900 --> 37:07.260
and I'm like a foot shorter

37:07.260 --> 37:09.060
than you would have elbowed towards.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.060
Yeah, he's a tall wisp.

37:12.740 --> 37:15.540
I'm like an absolute waif of a man.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.460
The sudden jerking of his elbow

37:18.460 --> 37:20.180
to sneak up on the gentleman sends Harvey

37:20.180 --> 37:22.420
into like protect mode and he grabs you

37:22.420 --> 37:23.540
and just moves you away.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.860
Oh, you can pick me up off the ground, yeah.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.660
And as you do, he's just like,

37:27.660 --> 37:30.540
oh, the strength of physicality is mighty,

37:30.540 --> 37:32.420
but it's nothing compared to the mind.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.780
I just want you to keep your distance

37:33.780 --> 37:35.220
from here on out, you understand?

37:35.220 --> 37:37.860
Hey, don't be touching, don't be touching me,

37:37.860 --> 37:38.700
don't be touching him.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.180
Why are you talking to my man like that?

37:40.180 --> 37:41.060
Because he's touching him.

37:41.060 --> 37:42.900
My man is having a conversation with your man

37:42.900 --> 37:44.220
because your man was touching me.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.420
Conversation doesn't have to involve hands

37:46.420 --> 37:47.580
or picking people up.

37:47.580 --> 37:49.140
Keep your man away from my man.

37:49.140 --> 37:49.980
Deal.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.060
Harvey's still holding Elden up in the air

37:54.060 --> 37:56.900
and Elden's feet are twiddling back and forth

37:56.900 --> 38:01.060
and he is staring directly into Harvey's eyes

38:01.060 --> 38:02.980
and making a choice.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.420
And then his eyes kind of soften.

38:06.420 --> 38:07.760
I don't wanna hurt you.

38:08.940 --> 38:13.340
Harvey laughs as he sets him back down on the ground.

38:13.340 --> 38:15.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure you don't.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.100
I certainly do not.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.460
There's a little bit in Harvey that's like,

38:19.460 --> 38:20.940
what, what, what, what?

38:21.500 --> 38:25.020
So Elden Ring has a 90 in Intimidate.

38:26.780 --> 38:29.660
Also probably people don't talk back to Harvey much at all.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.060
I was gonna say I have an 80.

38:33.900 --> 38:37.960
Just two very strong-willed minds staring at each other.

38:38.940 --> 38:39.780
That's cool.

38:39.780 --> 38:42.260
Elden, do you have our invitations?

38:42.260 --> 38:47.260
He kind of pats at his chest softly and slowly

38:48.100 --> 38:52.380
before grabbing the invitations out of his trouser pocket.

38:54.380 --> 38:56.900
Yeah, I mean, you can scurry in out of the cold.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.580
The snow is getting a bit heavier at this stage.

38:59.580 --> 39:02.980
You can see that the chauffeurs, having dropped people off,

39:02.980 --> 39:05.060
are running over to one of the outbuildings

39:05.060 --> 39:08.080
where it looks like they've got their own party in progress,

39:08.080 --> 39:10.300
just on the other side of the courtyard.

39:10.300 --> 39:15.300
But the main doors of the manor house are open

39:15.780 --> 39:18.060
and there's a maid there.

39:18.060 --> 39:19.620
Oh, in fact, there are a few maids there

39:19.620 --> 39:22.100
who seem to be ushering guests in in shifts

39:22.100 --> 39:23.460
and taking their coats.

39:23.460 --> 39:26.780
And yeah, there's a uniformed maid who comes up

39:26.780 --> 39:30.140
and looks around at the bunch of you and says,

39:30.140 --> 39:32.500
can I take your coats?

39:32.500 --> 39:34.720
Looks at Elden and blinks.

39:35.660 --> 39:39.260
And on cue, I could pull the drawstring

39:39.260 --> 39:40.660
coming out of his butt.

39:40.660 --> 39:42.120
The warmth is inside me.

39:42.280 --> 39:46.480
Very good, sir.

39:46.480 --> 39:48.280
Checkers hands his coat over

39:48.280 --> 39:52.720
and then grabs a bunch of pamphlets out of the pocket

39:52.720 --> 39:55.680
as he's handing it over, puts them in his pocket.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.440
Elden Ring gets really serious

39:57.440 --> 40:00.680
as Checkers hands over his coat and is like,

40:00.680 --> 40:05.360
do not misplace the master's coat.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.120
Yeah, I just bought it.

40:07.120 --> 40:10.880
It was expensive, so put it in a special place.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.960
The maid now carrying those, the three coats,

40:12.960 --> 40:14.280
is standing there looking at the bunch of you

40:14.280 --> 40:15.840
wishing to get a word in edgeways.

40:15.840 --> 40:20.040
She eventually says, if you make your way

40:20.040 --> 40:21.840
over to the ballroom, and she points out

40:21.840 --> 40:24.320
from under all the coats, a set of double doors

40:24.320 --> 40:26.760
that are open just over on your left.

40:26.760 --> 40:31.120
The hallway that you're in is fairly large.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.040
There's a chandelier overhead

40:33.040 --> 40:34.840
because of course the fuck he is.

40:35.680 --> 40:39.840
And I mean, certainly Lafayette knows

40:39.840 --> 40:42.280
from his previous visits to the mount

40:42.280 --> 40:47.280
that while Mordent has money, money doesn't buy taste

40:48.160 --> 40:53.160
and the furnishings, some of them are quite nice pieces,

40:53.840 --> 40:57.400
but he has no eye for how things go together.

40:57.400 --> 41:02.040
The decor is generally tacky

41:02.080 --> 41:04.880
for people who've got genuine taste.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.800
My God, Harvey, look at that chandelier.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.400
I know, it's gorgeous, isn't it?

41:10.840 --> 41:14.840
Oh, Harvey, he's a simple man.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.560
No, it's quite hideous, actually.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.600
I tell you what, if I ever got this kind of money,

41:20.600 --> 41:21.560
I'd do it up like this.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.800
Look at this, this is the lap of luxury here.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.360
You're a kind man, Harvey.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.720
Thank you for watching after me.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.200
If you think this is luxurious,

41:29.200 --> 41:30.680
you should see our joint.

41:31.640 --> 41:35.240
No, we are not spending time together this evening.

41:35.240 --> 41:39.480
We are moving, why are you still right next to us?

41:39.480 --> 41:41.560
It's a party, it's a party.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.280
Yes, Eldon, so please, please go mingle.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.320
Eldon, the suitcase guy, he's off the list,

41:48.320 --> 41:51.400
but his friend, he seems like somebody we could get.

41:53.400 --> 41:57.360
Spend tonight pestering and harassing my man.

41:57.360 --> 42:00.400
Correct, we will be having pleasant conversation

42:00.960 --> 42:03.720
about the last branch and all the good that we're doing.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.400
You seem like a guy that wants to do big things.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.600
Come now, Harvey, come along, come, Harvey.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.880
Well, we'll have chandeliers like this eventually.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.960
Harvey dutifully just follows Lafayette.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.040
Remember the chandeliers.

42:14.040 --> 42:14.880
Chandeliers.

42:18.320 --> 42:21.880
Eldon, the famous actress that we're looking for,

42:21.880 --> 42:24.360
I know her name, but do you remember it?

42:24.360 --> 42:26.240
I love Test's master.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.600
Yes, her name is Candace Germain.

42:28.600 --> 42:30.320
Correct, let's find her.

42:31.200 --> 42:35.320
And he motions his head forward for some sort of physical.

42:36.880 --> 42:40.200
Before we start splitting, are we in party town now?

42:40.200 --> 42:41.040
Is there?

42:41.040 --> 42:42.680
Are we in party town?

42:42.680 --> 42:44.520
Yes, Harvey, you may have one drink.

42:48.360 --> 42:52.160
So yes, you've come in through this rather grand hallway

42:52.160 --> 42:54.160
and there are corridors branching off

42:54.160 --> 42:55.280
in a few different directions.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.040
You can see that there are other sets of double doors

42:58.080 --> 43:01.240
around here that are obviously going into other rooms

43:01.240 --> 43:03.480
that may be off limits to you.

43:03.480 --> 43:08.320
There's a staircase going up to the upstairs, obviously,

43:08.320 --> 43:13.320
but all the action seems to be in the ballroom.

43:13.920 --> 43:17.440
You're ushered through the double doors there

43:17.440 --> 43:21.960
to this fairly grand looking room.

43:21.960 --> 43:24.160
Doesn't really have much in the way of furniture

43:24.160 --> 43:25.960
in it at the moment because it is a ballroom.

43:25.960 --> 43:30.000
It's got a few side tables set up with snacks and drinks

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
and there are uniform staff wandering around with trays,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.840
again, with refreshments on them.

43:37.840 --> 43:41.640
There are a few dozen people in attendance.

43:41.640 --> 43:45.120
It's quite a large ballroom and maybe the guest list

43:45.120 --> 43:47.240
is very exclusive or maybe a number of people

43:47.240 --> 43:49.760
just plain haven't turned up.

43:49.760 --> 43:53.160
But I mean, the party is relatively lively,

43:53.160 --> 43:56.160
but it's not exactly jumping, it's not packed.

43:56.160 --> 43:59.000
There is a stage that is set up

43:59.000 --> 44:02.120
over in front of the front window.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.400
And you can see a few things there.

44:03.400 --> 44:06.440
One, the most obvious thing is there is a live band

44:06.440 --> 44:09.840
that is playing there, a live swing band.

44:09.840 --> 44:13.760
And there is just off to the side of the stage as well

44:13.760 --> 44:16.760
and some bulky shapes, boxy shapes

44:16.760 --> 44:20.560
that are covered by sheets or a tarpaulin.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.000
What kind of size is that covered thing?

44:23.680 --> 44:26.880
Fairly large, maybe about the size of a car.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.920
I mean, it probably doesn't take much to work out

44:29.920 --> 44:34.440
that it roughly corresponds to where you saw the cable

44:34.440 --> 44:37.160
come down from the aerial outside.

44:37.160 --> 44:39.480
But yeah, as I said, there are a few dozen people

44:39.480 --> 44:42.840
mingling around, a few of them dancing.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.640
A number of them not dancing, but certainly having drinks

44:46.640 --> 44:49.640
and talking or shouting at each other over the music.

44:49.640 --> 44:53.240
Harvey wants to do his job as a bodyguard to Lafayette.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.880
When we walk in the room, just kind of clock it,

44:54.880 --> 44:56.200
see if there's anything that could maybe

44:56.200 --> 44:57.320
pose a threat to him.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.920
Okay, I'll tell you what, give me a psychology roll

45:00.920 --> 45:03.000
to get a general read of the crowd.

45:05.680 --> 45:08.600
Oh shoot, it's a fail, a 67 on a 50.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.400
Well, I mean, you could either spend 17 points of luck

45:11.400 --> 45:14.600
or if you want, you could find some way of pushing it.

45:14.600 --> 45:17.760
I mean, if you can think of a way of escalating

45:17.760 --> 45:20.040
the situation and potentially putting yourself at risk

45:20.040 --> 45:22.920
while assessing threats, I'd be open to that.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.880
You could probably get a better vantage point

45:25.880 --> 45:27.520
if you're on the chandelier.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.360
Yeah.

45:31.360 --> 45:34.560
Actually, could I maybe go and put myself up on stage

45:34.560 --> 45:36.240
to look down from the stage?

45:36.240 --> 45:38.360
Oh, okay, yeah, I mean, you could try.

45:38.360 --> 45:41.600
Yeah, I mean, there is a little set of wooden stairs

45:41.600 --> 45:43.640
up to the side that you could go on.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.760
Like I say, there is a full swing band up there

45:45.760 --> 45:49.200
who are very much in the midst of a song, but...

45:49.200 --> 45:53.200
Yep, so Harvey's gonna bumble his way up there.

45:53.200 --> 45:56.720
Okay, yeah, I think if you fail the push here,

45:57.680 --> 46:00.440
you'll get to attract all sorts of the wrong attention.

46:03.440 --> 46:05.680
I pass, a 21 on a 50.

46:05.680 --> 46:09.800
Fantastic, so you get a rough read

46:09.800 --> 46:13.000
of the kinds of people who are in the room.

46:13.040 --> 46:17.640
There are a few people who are obviously moneyed.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.600
You can tell from their clothes, from their mannerisms

46:20.600 --> 46:22.560
that, yeah, there are definitely

46:22.560 --> 46:24.440
a few movers and shakers here.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.360
Lafayette has like snuck up behind,

46:26.360 --> 46:30.280
like he followed Harvey very poorly,

46:30.280 --> 46:31.920
kind of like crouched down behind him,

46:31.920 --> 46:33.680
and he's like, tell me what you see.

46:33.680 --> 46:35.640
He pokes out behind him on the stage and he's like,

46:35.640 --> 46:38.240
oh, I see some of my cousins here, this is...

46:40.240 --> 46:41.080
I didn't wanna see.

46:41.080 --> 46:42.280
You can see a few other people

46:42.280 --> 46:44.920
who don't necessarily fit the same mold,

46:44.920 --> 46:49.560
and there's something about the slightly more worn

46:49.560 --> 46:54.560
looking clothing and general introvertedness

46:54.680 --> 46:57.840
that makes you think that they're probably academics.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.880
Then there are a few other people

46:59.880 --> 47:01.240
who just don't seem to fit in.

47:01.240 --> 47:05.280
You do spot, I don't know whether you heard

47:05.280 --> 47:07.400
the others mentioning Candace Germaine earlier,

47:07.400 --> 47:09.920
but I mean, you certainly do spot her in the crowd

47:09.920 --> 47:13.040
and you may have seen some of her films.

47:13.040 --> 47:16.080
She seems to be in deep conversation at the moment

47:16.080 --> 47:21.080
with a fairly good looking man in clerical garb

47:21.360 --> 47:24.840
wearing a black shirt and a dog collar,

47:24.840 --> 47:27.880
who, you know, the two of them

47:27.880 --> 47:30.120
are in very animated conversation.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.120
Do I clock Mordant in the room?

47:32.120 --> 47:36.040
No, looking around, Mordant isn't there.

47:36.040 --> 47:36.880
Okay.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.040
Which may strike you as being a bit odd.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.680
You know, we got the usual sword here, boss.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.040
We got the real money,

47:43.040 --> 47:45.920
we got the guys who are more like you, the thinkers,

47:45.920 --> 47:47.160
and it looks like there's a,

47:47.160 --> 47:51.480
you seen that picture show, Last Train to Clarksville?

47:51.480 --> 47:53.640
That's Candace Germaine right there.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.720
Good God, Candace Germaine is in here.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.680
A true beauty.

47:57.680 --> 47:58.720
Where'd you say you saw her?

47:58.720 --> 48:00.440
Well, we're not there, but.

48:00.440 --> 48:01.800
Yeah, when we look behind

48:01.800 --> 48:03.440
and you're crouched down behind me.

48:03.440 --> 48:08.440
I turn around and Eldon parts his hair.

48:10.040 --> 48:12.600
I'd love to think as well that you're kind of

48:12.600 --> 48:16.160
in between the guitarist and the bassist of the swing band

48:16.160 --> 48:18.280
and the two of them are just stepping around you

48:18.280 --> 48:20.920
as they're doing their act, trying not to tread on you.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.960
We're becoming real quick pals here, huh?

48:24.960 --> 48:26.680
Don't step on any wires.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.520
No, that is do not step on any wires

48:28.520 --> 48:29.880
because there's something very strange

48:29.880 --> 48:34.720
going on here tonight with all of his wires.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.560
I haven't noticed anything, but.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.720
Cicero is up to something.

48:40.720 --> 48:44.600
Master Checkers, that's Candace Germaine right there

48:44.600 --> 48:46.760
that they were pointing and talking about,

48:46.760 --> 48:48.160
talking to the cleric man.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.560
I pull out a pamphlet and look at Eldon

48:50.560 --> 48:52.680
and I just kind of nod at him.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.720
Bring her to me.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.320
Well, yeah, as he's saying that,

48:57.320 --> 49:00.400
she breaks off conversation with the vicar or the priest

49:00.400 --> 49:04.200
or whatever he is and she walks over

49:04.200 --> 49:06.200
and starts talking to someone else.

49:06.240 --> 49:10.360
So was Eldon going over to join the conversation?

49:10.360 --> 49:13.160
I was trying to get the more charismatic

49:13.160 --> 49:15.280
or good looking one to start the conversation.

49:15.280 --> 49:18.520
We kind of have a thing where if we can isolate someone,

49:18.520 --> 49:22.480
we can slowly work them down into joining us.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.200
So is it Checkers who's going over?

49:24.200 --> 49:26.840
Checkers heads on over to Ms. Germaine.

49:26.840 --> 49:30.600
Yeah, she's there talking to an older man,

49:30.600 --> 49:33.120
looks like he's probably in his late 50s,

49:33.160 --> 49:35.840
dressed in a three piece suit.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.680
He's fairly jowdy.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.640
He's got red features,

49:40.480 --> 49:45.480
a few broken veins across his face and ruby eyes

49:45.520 --> 49:47.880
and the two of them seem to be

49:47.880 --> 49:50.440
just making small talk as you come up.

49:50.440 --> 49:53.080
Or you could give me an education roll

49:53.080 --> 49:55.320
to see what they can recognize who the man is.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.560
That's a pass, 43 on a 70.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.120
Okay, yeah, you recognize the man

50:00.120 --> 50:01.400
from some newspaper articles

50:01.440 --> 50:03.840
who's seen as Charlton Billings.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.840
He's a Senator from Vermont.

50:05.840 --> 50:09.400
I go to him first, Senator, nice to see you.

50:09.400 --> 50:12.760
My name is, you can just call me Checkers.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.160
And I reach my hand out to shake his hand.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.200
Well, he gives you a warm handshake

50:18.200 --> 50:23.200
and says Checkers, just the one name then.

50:23.880 --> 50:26.040
Right, it's what my friends call me in.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.240
We're all friends here.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.080
Oh, I hope so, I hope so.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.200
I hope I can count on your vote next year.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.840
Absolutely, I actually have a friend here with me

50:34.840 --> 50:38.400
who may not be so inclined to vote for you,

50:38.400 --> 50:41.040
but maybe you could go convince him.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.400
And I gesture at Eldon.

50:44.240 --> 50:47.120
Eldon is in an enclave of this room already,

50:47.120 --> 50:48.920
like away from the crowd.

50:48.920 --> 50:52.000
And he's just staring through his parted hair

50:52.000 --> 50:53.480
across the party.

50:53.480 --> 50:57.760
He has some very serious feelings about

50:57.760 --> 50:59.440
Senator things.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.640
The Senator looks over at Eldon,

51:05.640 --> 51:09.400
kind of looks him up and down and looks back at you.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.400
Fucking Oren from Parks and Rec.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.400
That's exactly who it is.

51:16.400 --> 51:19.120
He says, are you sure he votes?

51:19.120 --> 51:24.120
Only when he really loves or hates something.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.920
And he's got strong feelings.

51:30.920 --> 51:34.320
And then I wink at him and I want to roll charm.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.280
Okay, yeah.

51:36.520 --> 51:37.520
That's a three.

51:37.520 --> 51:39.840
Oh, it's a really good wink.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.960
He says, well, a voter's a voter, I suppose.

51:42.960 --> 51:47.400
And he turns and marches over towards Eldon.

51:47.400 --> 51:48.680
God help him.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.840
Candace.

51:49.840 --> 51:53.480
And I do like the European kiss the cheeks greeting.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.200
Ah, checkers, you made it.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.080
I'm here, thank you for the invite.

51:57.080 --> 51:59.960
You can see that she's looking a bit ruddy

51:59.960 --> 52:01.320
and swaying a bit.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.440
The party hasn't been going for that long,

52:04.440 --> 52:06.640
but it looks like she's quite drunk already.

52:06.640 --> 52:07.840
Does she have a drink in her hand?

52:07.840 --> 52:09.000
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.760
Oh, let me take that from you.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.640
It's, I'll hold it for you.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.400
And I grab the like martini

52:14.400 --> 52:16.000
and I just like drink the rest of it

52:16.000 --> 52:18.400
and hand her back an empty glass.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.520
She looks at you and pats you on the shoulder.

52:20.520 --> 52:21.680
That's what I do with Luke sometimes.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.400
Oh, it's all right, I can get another.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.520
Oh, that's probably good.

52:26.520 --> 52:27.400
You're probably good.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.720
No, no, no, she says, it's all right, it's all right.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.920
Give me a moment.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.760
I'll pay a visit to the ladies room

52:36.760 --> 52:40.400
and powder my nose if you know what I mean.

52:40.400 --> 52:42.640
And I'm sure I'll be fine after that.

52:42.640 --> 52:43.480
Cocaine.

52:43.480 --> 52:45.680
I sure do know what you mean.

52:45.680 --> 52:46.880
Perfect, well.

52:46.880 --> 52:48.840
You're welcome to join me if you want.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.760
Sure.

52:50.760 --> 52:51.600
Yay.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.920
We got cocaine into this campaign.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.080
Our perfect record is untouched.

53:02.960 --> 53:06.280
If Eldon or Checkers had looked up

53:06.280 --> 53:07.360
at any point in that time,

53:07.360 --> 53:10.680
they would have seen Lafayette and Harvey slipping out

53:10.680 --> 53:12.480
of the main ballroom,

53:12.480 --> 53:14.840
trying to follow some of these wires

53:14.840 --> 53:17.800
and some of the weird mechanical things

53:17.800 --> 53:18.800
that he's seeing here.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.320
Okay, so basically you're heading out the front

53:21.320 --> 53:22.920
to where that aerial was.

53:22.920 --> 53:23.760
Yeah.

53:23.760 --> 53:26.120
As you see Checkers and Candace walk into the bathroom,

53:26.120 --> 53:29.200
he's like grabbing like champagne off the waiters,

53:29.200 --> 53:31.120
like things and just like downing it

53:31.120 --> 53:33.320
because he's actually never done drugs

53:33.320 --> 53:34.480
and he's very nervous.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.560
This is a big get for your cult.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.680
Oh yeah, huge.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.960
Also you're 19.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.280
I'm underage drinking.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.160
The movie star just asked you to go to the bathroom

53:45.160 --> 53:47.840
to get cocaine, which is pretty cool.

53:47.840 --> 53:49.880
I assume she's probably,

53:49.880 --> 53:51.960
is she like a late twenties actress

53:51.960 --> 53:53.160
or is she like established?

53:53.160 --> 53:54.160
It's 1937.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.320
Yeah, no, she's a few years older than you

53:56.320 --> 53:57.360
but not a lot older.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.600
Okay, cool.

53:58.600 --> 54:03.600
You find a bathroom and she cuts a few lines for you

54:04.200 --> 54:08.920
and just makes a bit of small talk and says,

54:08.920 --> 54:10.360
do you manage to get here all right?

54:10.360 --> 54:12.040
Well, of course you managed to get here all right

54:12.040 --> 54:13.640
because you're here, aren't you?

54:14.760 --> 54:17.240
Sorry, I don't know where my head is today

54:17.240 --> 54:18.520
and snorts another line.

54:20.840 --> 54:24.120
You know, sometimes parties can be a little overwhelming

54:24.120 --> 54:26.640
and then he looks at the lines of coke

54:26.640 --> 54:28.160
on the bathroom counter

54:28.160 --> 54:30.840
and not knowing the protocol for this,

54:30.840 --> 54:33.680
he does all the rest of the lines of cocaine.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.440
We're gonna need you to roll a con check

54:37.440 --> 54:38.880
to make sure you don't die.

54:38.880 --> 54:40.120
This is a new one that we're trying out

54:40.160 --> 54:42.000
where when you actually do drugs in the game,

54:42.000 --> 54:43.600
you have to do drugs as the player.

54:43.600 --> 54:44.720
We're method playing.

54:44.720 --> 54:47.680
So give us about two and a half hours

54:47.680 --> 54:52.680
while we go find some cocaine and we'll be right back.

54:52.920 --> 54:56.280
Candace smiles at checkers as he does

54:56.280 --> 54:58.560
the last three lines single-handedly

54:58.560 --> 55:01.760
and says, oh my, aren't you a hungry little boy?

55:04.200 --> 55:08.200
I'm not that little, he says with his 40 size.

55:09.200 --> 55:13.280
Oh my God, I didn't realize where my tiny was.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.920
I've got a big personality.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.160
If 40 size is good enough for Charlie Manson,

55:17.160 --> 55:18.600
it's good enough for you.

55:18.600 --> 55:19.440
Exactly.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.320
Candace, have you thought any more

55:26.320 --> 55:29.360
about our last conversation about last branch

55:29.360 --> 55:31.560
and maybe be in the face of it?

55:31.560 --> 55:33.200
Yes, yes.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.560
Though, I don't know.

55:34.560 --> 55:37.480
I think I may have other commitments now.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.880
I think I'm going to be employed

55:39.880 --> 55:43.000
to help promote Cicero's new invention.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.880
Our deal wouldn't necessarily be exclusive.

55:45.880 --> 55:48.280
You know, you could, it could just be something

55:48.280 --> 55:50.440
you mentioned when you do everything else that you do.

55:50.440 --> 55:54.040
Oh, maybe, but this has got to take up all my time.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.720
It's got to change the world, you know.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.720
What is his invention?

55:57.720 --> 55:59.960
She looks confused for a moment.

56:01.760 --> 56:03.040
It's got to change the world.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.840
Well, you know, maybe we could go talk to him.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.520
Maybe you could introduce me to him.

56:07.520 --> 56:08.880
I haven't met him yet either.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.880
I don't know where he is.

56:10.880 --> 56:15.120
Oh, she roots through her purse a bit and says,

56:15.120 --> 56:17.320
and that was the last of the cocaine.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.480
Oh, but I suppose someone else here must have some.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.280
Do you think you could find some more for me?

56:22.280 --> 56:23.800
I'm sure I could, yeah.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.080
I'll look around.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.840
In the meantime, he pulls out a piece of paper

56:28.840 --> 56:32.360
and you can tell it's like a crudely drawn up contract.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.720
And he...

56:34.720 --> 56:37.160
It's like stick figures and it's like,

56:37.680 --> 56:38.680
just him giving her the paper

56:38.680 --> 56:40.280
and the paper says your soul.

56:41.960 --> 56:44.080
No, basically it's like a contract he's written up

56:44.080 --> 56:46.720
to have her be kind of like the spokesperson

56:46.720 --> 56:48.440
for the last branch.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.000
And he hands it to her, he's like,

56:50.000 --> 56:54.040
real quick while I go look for more fun,

56:54.040 --> 56:55.960
just sign this at the bottom here.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.560
Well, I'll get my lawyer to look at it

56:58.560 --> 56:59.520
and send it back to you.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.040
Oh, we don't need, I studied,

57:02.040 --> 57:03.640
I took a couple law classes.

57:03.640 --> 57:04.480
She laughs.

57:04.480 --> 57:05.800
It's a pretty good contract.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.400
She laughs and playfully punches you in the shoulder

57:08.400 --> 57:11.720
and says, after all the things that happened with the MGM,

57:11.720 --> 57:14.160
my lawyer told me never to sign anything again

57:14.160 --> 57:15.280
without talking to him.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.120
Yeah.

57:16.120 --> 57:19.400
Checkers figured that this was coming,

57:19.400 --> 57:21.720
but he had to take his chance anyway.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.360
So he grabs the contract back, folds it up

57:24.360 --> 57:25.920
and he's like, okay, well,

57:25.920 --> 57:28.480
I'll talk to you when I find more.

57:28.480 --> 57:29.320
Yes, yes, yes.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.480
But don't forget cocaine.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.880
Right, right, I'm on it.

57:33.880 --> 57:36.320
And he leaves the bathroom and it's in his mind,

57:36.320 --> 57:39.240
but it really, he isn't gonna actively be looking

57:39.240 --> 57:41.080
for drugs.

57:41.080 --> 57:44.120
Oh, she's got to be so disbunched in you.

57:45.800 --> 57:49.440
He's also like experiencing cocaine for the first time ever

57:49.440 --> 57:53.160
and he's stoked and scared to death.

57:53.160 --> 57:54.480
And in like 20 minutes,

57:54.480 --> 57:56.120
he's gonna be looking for more cocaine.

57:56.120 --> 57:57.440
Yes, absolutely.

58:00.560 --> 58:03.760
Okay, well, let's cut back to Lafayette

58:03.760 --> 58:08.160
and Harvey as they're heading outside in the snow.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.960
And now without your coats,

58:09.960 --> 58:12.280
you can appreciate just how cold it is out there.

58:12.280 --> 58:15.280
The snow's coming down quite heavily now.

58:15.280 --> 58:18.560
But you can see, yeah, there is this thick wire

58:18.560 --> 58:20.640
that's coming through the wall.

58:20.640 --> 58:23.560
In fact, it's like a bunch of cables

58:23.560 --> 58:25.200
that have been bound together

58:25.200 --> 58:28.240
that are going up to this aerial.

58:28.240 --> 58:32.440
Lafayette gives that wire an expert and knowledgeable lick.

58:34.680 --> 58:38.240
I'm giving the cold temperature out here.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.800
A little Christmas story going on.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.200
Oh, God.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.800
Do you want to give me a luck roll

58:45.800 --> 58:48.600
to see whether your tongue ends up frozen to the cables?

58:49.480 --> 58:52.360
My name is David Ellington.

58:52.360 --> 58:54.880
My God, Harvey, I've made quite a bit thick.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.400
Pass, 17 on a 55.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.400
Okay, yeah.

58:59.400 --> 59:01.360
I mean, you pull it away just in time

59:01.360 --> 59:04.080
so you can feel the ice crystals falling across.

59:04.080 --> 59:06.800
The main thing the cable tastes of is cold.

59:07.840 --> 59:09.560
He makes a note of that.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.640
I actually said that at a wine tasting one time.

59:13.640 --> 59:15.200
Everyone's looking at me weird.

59:17.840 --> 59:19.320
But looking at it,

59:19.320 --> 59:22.240
yeah, I mean, you passed your engineering role earlier,

59:22.240 --> 59:24.280
so I won't ask you to roll again.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.320
So looking at this,

59:25.320 --> 59:30.080
you're fairly certain that this is a power cable.

59:30.080 --> 59:32.480
In fact, it looks like it's designed

59:32.480 --> 59:35.520
to carry quite a lot of power,

59:35.520 --> 59:38.600
but it's just going up to this aerial contraption,

59:38.600 --> 59:41.480
which doesn't really make a lot of sense to you.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.120
And you can see as well

59:43.120 --> 59:45.560
that the aerial is pointing in the direction

59:45.560 --> 59:48.040
of that wooden tower

59:48.040 --> 59:52.800
that you saw across on the outskirts of the compound.

59:56.320 --> 59:59.120
Is there anywhere I can unplug it, this power source?

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.200
Not without tools, not easily.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.160
I mean, you could try just ripping it out,

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.880
but this is like industrial cabling.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.240
If you're going to try to sabotage it like that,

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:15.680
it would require, yeah, for a start, tools, a bit of time.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.360
You probably need a ladder to get up there.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360
I mean, it's not impossible.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.880
It's just under the circumstances a bit tricky.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.680
So he gives it a few very honest tugs.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.440
He's honestly trying to unplug it.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.200
But when he realizes it's going nowhere,

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.800
he sets it down and he's like,

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.400
only joking, Harvey, we don't want to win that way.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.000
Do I have a sense of what any of this could be for?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.240
Do you have the weird science, pulp talent?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.080
I do.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.680
Okay, you made your engineering role earlier.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.920
Yeah, you don't know entirely for sure.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.000
You'd have to go and take a look at what's in that tower

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.680
to tell for sure.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.840
But there's something nagging your way

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.880
at the back of your brain.

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:03.840
You're thinking of some of the wilder designs

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.760
that Nikola Tesla came up with.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:11.760
And this looks maybe like it's designed

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.880
for the wireless transmission of electricity.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:19.400
Harvey, this isn't normal science.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.600
You turn and Harvey's licking the wire that you...

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.360
Harvey, you fool.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.120
There's nothing to learn from that,

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.480
but that it tastes of cold.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.000
That's exactly what I was going to say.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It tastes like cold.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.120
Harvey, please listen.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.480
This is terribly important.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.040
Again, this is not normal science.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.160
How are we talking?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.040
I didn't know a body could be hollow

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.040
before its blood ran cold.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.680
I didn't know that the wind could sew

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.400
the tissue and fagged bone.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.600
You were hollow when you spoke to me.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.600
Hollow when you sang.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.720
I thought you might be starving.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:34.200
So I gave you everything.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.960
Thought you were hollow.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.960
Thorns and rocks and devils' clothes

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.960
and briars and dry-baked clay.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.960
Crocus blossoms in February

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.960
and Dalian in May.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.960
Time between a mother's fingers

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.960
and spit off a bridge.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.960
Restless legs at 3 p.m.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.960
while waiting for a fix.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.960
So come back here

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.960
and see what's left of me.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.960
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.960
My voice is nothing now

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.960
but the howl of the wind

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.960
come closer to my teeth

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:38.960
rattling my jaw.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.960
Come closer dear

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.960
you might see

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.960
rattling my jaw.
