What's up my spooky skeletons, it's your bone pappy wolf the dog, and I'm back from the past

00:07.500 --> 00:10.620
clapping that ass and lapping up trash here on

00:11.700 --> 00:13.700
694.2 PTBP

00:14.040 --> 00:18.440
contentions most coherent and easy to follow radio station

00:18.580 --> 00:24.540
But on the off chance you disagree with that objective sentiment. We're dropping a very special

00:25.320 --> 00:32.520
Recapulation of the entire situation going down here in contention seems like a good time for it

00:32.520 --> 00:35.160
You know your Wolfie might take a couple notes

00:35.320 --> 00:42.760
Even though I am a all-seeing all-knowing being and all that this week's howling with wolf is from Sinbad

00:42.920 --> 00:48.500
Yeah, that Sinbad the mailman and jingle all the way the genie and Shazam

00:49.040 --> 00:52.680
Wait what for real like the Berenstain Bears thing?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.600
Fuck

00:54.600 --> 01:00.520
Okay, what the fuck is going on around here Sinbad wasn't a genie in a movie called Shazam

01:01.600 --> 01:04.460
How the way Sinbad how the way?

01:05.040 --> 01:10.560
Zack the wolf what's up? This is Sinbad man understand you having a hard time with the Mandela effect man

01:10.560 --> 01:14.560
It's not Zack told me Zack Reeves. Got me here with this. He said you having some issues man

01:14.560 --> 01:20.440
And look I've dealt with the phenomena. It's a real phenomena. They see this a movie Shazam that I never did

01:20.440 --> 01:23.880
But they didn't do a can we do a part two who knows they might put me in that one

01:23.880 --> 01:26.780
So you never know, but uh, no, I never did Shazam

01:27.440 --> 01:33.120
Never I just read the comic books and watched the TV show when I was a kid coming up. So, uh,

01:33.680 --> 01:36.360
I'm the height. I don't know what kind of Mandela effect you going through

01:36.520 --> 01:40.960
All I can say is this man if you're going through the Mandela effect man is messing with you mess with your mind

01:42.040 --> 01:44.040
Not weed CBD

01:44.440 --> 01:48.800
Not weed less weed more CBD. All right now

01:49.440 --> 01:51.440
Listen to me

01:52.800 --> 01:57.840
Sinbad more like sin great. Am I right folks?

01:57.840 --> 02:02.640
I hope y'all were laughing because otherwise I'm gonna be crying

02:03.600 --> 02:06.160

It is kudzu with no backbone

04:12.800 --> 04:16.920
Unseasonably warm December 1st in a small town called

04:17.840 --> 04:23.760
Contention a thin mist could be seen under the streetlights on an empty

04:24.280 --> 04:27.880
Country road the inside of the contention police department

04:27.880 --> 04:33.960
However was cozy warm and bright at the front desk every morning and every evening

04:34.640 --> 04:41.920
Drew Andrews sat determined small teeth and big gums showing answering the phone and taking messages

04:42.000 --> 04:45.760
in the bullpen sat our three PCs or

04:46.640 --> 04:52.600
Protagonist cops though neither of those words seemed to factually describe these player characters

04:52.960 --> 04:59.380
Clark Bishop was the oldest by the book officer dead set on doing his best in this dead-end job

04:59.940 --> 05:03.220
Still living in the house. His parents left him when they died

05:03.760 --> 05:08.060
He had never cooked and he watched Wheel of Fortune every night

05:08.460 --> 05:10.900
Keith Vigna was raised just outside

05:11.420 --> 05:16.660
Contention but soon moved to the city where he trained to become a police officer

05:17.140 --> 05:23.540
His stint in the city was short-lived. He's not a bad cop. He's just a bad cop

05:24.180 --> 05:26.540
His pants are too big

05:27.280 --> 05:33.140
John Lee petty more the fourth was one of the few petty Moore's to stay on the right side of the law or at least

05:33.180 --> 05:39.380
The petty Moore version of that his mustache tight pants substance abuse issues and

05:39.820 --> 05:46.500
Inability to keep bullets in his clip aligned perfectly with both his family values and love of

05:46.900 --> 05:50.620
Smokey and the bandit on this evening December 1st

05:51.080 --> 05:57.260
Drew Andrews top lip receding gums akimbo received a bevy of calls complaints

05:57.700 --> 06:02.340
Regarding the abundance of howling coming from the dogs in the old neighborhood

06:02.660 --> 06:08.660
This neighborhood west of downtown was home to John Peters Mildred Mitchell Tildi B

06:08.660 --> 06:14.500
Mitchell councilwoman Carrie pages and the boss of the contention police department chief

06:14.780 --> 06:22.700
Maggie cook and it just so happened that December 1st this night when everything began was the Chiefs birthday

06:23.240 --> 06:25.880
Drew presented chief cook with a yellow journal

06:26.620 --> 06:30.820
Noting she already had this same notebook in both red and blue

06:31.420 --> 06:36.700
Clark got her the same thing. He got her the year before and every year before that

06:36.700 --> 06:39.860
He's been on the force a box of chocolates

06:40.300 --> 06:44.020
John pulled a bottle of cheap bourbon from his desk

06:44.180 --> 06:51.400
It was open and a third of it was gone, but he tried Keith panicked. He didn't realize it was the Chiefs birthday

06:51.900 --> 06:57.500
However, there was a mysterious package wrapped nicely sitting on Drew's desk

06:58.060 --> 07:00.060
Keith claimed it as his gift

07:00.140 --> 07:04.260
But when Maggie cook opened this present and saw its contents

07:04.260 --> 07:11.100
She began weeping walked into her office and slammed the door leaving Clark drew and John

07:11.780 --> 07:15.860
staring and bewilderment at the new kid in town Keith vigna

07:16.300 --> 07:22.540
chief Maggie cook distraught and determined left the contention police station without saying a word and

07:22.820 --> 07:30.940
The box were three items a single red rose a white hardhat and a black silk bowtie

07:32.060 --> 07:39.180
Before they could react drew Andrews received the phone call that set all of the preceding events in motion

07:40.000 --> 07:45.620
Julie Maxwell reported a dead body at the piston junkyard the chief list

07:45.980 --> 07:49.700
CPD headed out to investigate the scene on the way there

07:49.700 --> 07:55.240
They spotted Julie Maxwell driving chaotically and well above the speed limit back toward town

07:55.540 --> 08:02.940
John Lee Pettymore the fourth peeled off to pull her over just in time to see her near fatal car accident

08:03.180 --> 08:06.820
She was thrown clear of the vehicle face smashed

08:07.340 --> 08:09.340
crying out into the night

08:09.540 --> 08:13.600
John called an ambulance and investigated the crash in her car

08:13.600 --> 08:19.200
He found an open bottle of brandy gas cans lighters an unusual

08:19.480 --> 08:26.360
Camera with strange glass tubes a red light lit and a green light unlit as well as a Polaroid

08:26.720 --> 08:33.320
That showed the base of a tall building and a group crowding the entrance with fists raised

08:34.400 --> 08:42.480
Everything in this picture was lit by torches and some of the people's hands in the building was a slightly shiny pitch black

08:42.880 --> 08:48.200
Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop carried on to the piston junkyard where they found a body

08:48.920 --> 08:51.740
splattered on the ground face first face

08:52.260 --> 08:59.760
Smashed the body was wearing thick hand-stitched clothing and leather boots a small note in the pocket read

09:00.240 --> 09:03.600
We is striking when the land gets darkness

09:04.440 --> 09:06.320
readying torches

09:06.320 --> 09:07.720
Hesitate not

09:07.720 --> 09:15.560
Most peculiar however was the skin on this body's back a fresh wound. It was branded with the words

09:16.240 --> 09:18.240
This is a fool

09:18.480 --> 09:24.920
This corpse was determined to be a woman and the officers called in their fourth musketeer the only other

09:25.320 --> 09:27.460
contention police officer Ray

09:28.040 --> 09:31.080
To take the corpse over to County for testing

09:31.440 --> 09:35.500
They also called the city hospital to check on Julie Maxwell's condition

09:35.620 --> 09:37.620
She had been declared deceased

09:38.300 --> 09:42.580
after some light discussion of smashed faces and blunt force trauma

09:43.500 --> 09:47.680
Clark Bishop headed home to his TV dinner and Wheel of Fortune

09:48.240 --> 09:53.940
Keith Vigna went back to his temporary home hotel motel where his golden retriever bean

09:54.260 --> 10:02.100
Waited patiently and John Lee Pettymore the fourth shot some pool by himself at clinkers the local watering hole and daycare

10:02.780 --> 10:07.940
The next day on December 2nd three assignments awaited the three officers

10:08.500 --> 10:12.620
Councilwoman Carrie pages dog was missing and she was distraught

10:12.660 --> 10:19.220
The councilwoman suggested Tyler may have been eaten by a person as contention had just seen a rise in

10:19.820 --> 10:24.020
Homelessness Clark printed posters and walk the neighborhood all to no avail

10:24.700 --> 10:32.440
Jimmy Sanders an uncle of sorts to John Lee Pettymore called in an oil spill across a country road in the southeast

10:32.460 --> 10:34.460
Sometime around 4 a.m

10:34.620 --> 10:41.820
John checked it out found no oil spill and Jimmy admitted he was tripping on mushrooms during the incident

10:42.140 --> 10:43.420
Mildred Mitchell

10:43.420 --> 10:45.700
contentions kooky pothead grandma

10:46.060 --> 10:51.860
Wanted someone to know her neighbor's door was open and this neighbor this John Peters

10:52.100 --> 10:54.100
Hadn't been around in a few days

10:54.380 --> 11:01.780
Keith found out she saw a bright flash of light from Peters's place a few nights previous and he's been missing ever since

11:02.460 --> 11:08.260
He checked it out and found John's mail overflowing his car in the driveway and his front door

11:08.340 --> 11:15.420
Smashed into the drywall in the house were broken pictures and clear signs that John was a heavy drinker

11:15.500 --> 11:18.140
There was also a trunk in the living room

11:18.620 --> 11:21.440
Burned into the top of this trunk were the words

11:21.980 --> 11:29.100
Do not open if you want to live the trunk was empty save some foam padding that held four

11:29.500 --> 11:33.380
specifically shaped items one large to medium and one small

11:34.060 --> 11:40.020
There were betting stubs on John's nightstand. He bet on long shots and mostly lost

11:40.500 --> 11:47.540
John's keychain had his house keys a bottle opener his car keys a few small keys that said

11:47.660 --> 11:48.660
G10

11:48.660 --> 11:54.340
G11 and G12 and a key fob for a rewards program at dirty dog

11:54.580 --> 11:57.380
grooming a pet salon franchise in the city

11:57.620 --> 12:01.060
However, John didn't seem to have a dog

12:01.580 --> 12:08.820
According to Drew Andrews John Peters wasn't very interesting though. He did have a long stay in the hospital a couple years ago

12:09.700 --> 12:15.980
After meeting back up the three officers decided to look further into John Peters starting again at his home

12:16.260 --> 12:23.140
When they arrived his car was no longer in the driveway and the empty trunk was missing from inside the residence

12:23.780 --> 12:29.800
Mildred Mitchell came by to let them know two people came packed up the trunk into their white Toyota and took off

12:29.900 --> 12:33.640
One in their car and the other in John Peters maroon vehicle

12:34.060 --> 12:40.100
The officers headed to chief Maggie cooks house next her cruiser wasn't there. She wasn't there

12:40.100 --> 12:41.340
They hit up clinkers

12:41.340 --> 12:47.620
The only information from Harry clinker was that Keith liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread when he was a kid

12:48.420 --> 12:49.900
continuing this tour of

12:49.900 --> 12:57.340
Contention the cops went out to harass Leo piston the owner of the piston junkyard who had a restraining order placed against him by

12:57.340 --> 13:03.460
Julie Maxwell 15 years before after Leo was accused of killing Julie's sister Ashley

13:04.060 --> 13:08.780
Clark set up a meeting with Leo and George the piston brothers for the following day

13:08.900 --> 13:14.480
Keith stayed behind to keep a hidden eye on the piston pig farm back at the police station

13:15.060 --> 13:19.860
John found the Chiefs blue notebook full of work appointments and notes

13:19.860 --> 13:23.940
But her red notebook and the newly gifted yellow notebook weren't in her office

13:24.180 --> 13:31.100
That's about the time when contention received a chilling phone call the city hospital had fucked up

13:31.540 --> 13:36.100
They heard screaming from inside a drawer in the morgue

13:36.700 --> 13:43.020
Julie Maxwell was alive. John Lee pettymore took off for the city hospital to get some answers

13:44.660 --> 13:49.460
Clark came into the office to an equally confusing message from County

13:50.040 --> 13:56.140
Apparently that body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years ago

13:56.140 --> 13:59.420
But the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday

14:00.260 --> 14:08.140
Then Charles a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters came to the station to figure out what was going on

14:08.980 --> 14:14.260
Before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash in the parking lot

14:14.620 --> 14:21.680
Out of the piston pig farm Kathy piston shot the encroaching and trespassing Keith vigna in the foot

14:22.360 --> 14:23.120
Recognizing him though

14:23.120 --> 14:29.440
She bandaged his wound and offered her apologies for the incident after Keith claimed to have a warrant

14:29.440 --> 14:32.880
She offered him coffee Keith snooped around her property

14:33.280 --> 14:40.880
Failing to find anything of interest until he eventually stowed away on Kathy piston school bus full of homeless people

14:41.660 --> 14:49.320
Afraid of being caught though. He bailed out of the emergency hatch in the back further hurting his shot and bandaged foot in

14:50.320 --> 14:57.600
In the parking lot of the city hospital a creepy figure obscured by a black cloak and hood

14:58.160 --> 15:05.180
Approached John Lee pettymore the fourth this mysterious man handed John a note written in binary and croaked

15:05.320 --> 15:07.320
Say hello to me

15:08.520 --> 15:14.180
Before softly cackling and disappearing into the rows of parked cars

15:14.940 --> 15:21.140
John texted drew a picture of the binary note to translate and he radioed the only other

15:21.580 --> 15:28.420
Contention police officer Tim to do a search for storage facilities and contention with G units

15:28.800 --> 15:35.820
John didn't find Julie Maxwell at the hospital because she dipped stole a black SUV and made a beeline for contention

15:35.820 --> 15:43.640
This was of course the same black SUV that just t-boned George Pistons truck in the parking lot of the contention

15:44.000 --> 15:48.420
police station now helmed at gunpoint by a kidnapped Leo

15:48.920 --> 15:55.920
Piston the three officers pursued Julie Maxwell and Leo piston in the stolen black SUV out to splashylvania

15:56.440 --> 16:03.200
The abandoned vampire themed waterpark Ashley Maxwell was heading to 15 years ago when her life ended

16:04.040 --> 16:10.380
Bishop pettymore and hobbling vigna found their targets at the top of the two-fanged plunge

16:11.300 --> 16:16.300
Maxwell with a pistol to the back of the kneeling Leo pistons torso

16:16.380 --> 16:18.460
She cried out into the night

16:23.460 --> 16:29.580
Except for the black shiny devil and the underground temple from which it shall rise

16:30.100 --> 16:36.080
But if there's a tiny chance that justice matters, then my sister deserves this

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
To bleed out and die

16:39.680 --> 16:42.880
With that she fired a shot through Leo's body

16:43.480 --> 16:50.560
Clark immediately pulled his pistol and put a bullet through one of Julie Maxwell's eyes the two limp

16:50.800 --> 16:55.000
bodies slid slowly down the two opposing slides

16:55.300 --> 17:01.920
Wet for the first time in a decade and a half with the blood of these opposing contention residents

17:02.440 --> 17:04.440
But at the bottom of the ride

17:05.220 --> 17:07.480
Something incomprehensible happened

17:08.040 --> 17:15.420
the bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo piston were picked up and slammed into the ground repeatedly and at an

17:15.480 --> 17:21.320
Absurd rate by some unseen force and then as if they were never there at all

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
Both bodies were gone

17:24.760 --> 17:26.400
Keith saw

17:26.400 --> 17:31.800
Covering the ground where the two bodies just were a black shiny viscous sludge

17:32.200 --> 17:39.520
Seemingly inside this muck were the thrashing bodies of Julie Maxwell and Leo piston their hands reached out

17:39.720 --> 17:45.600
Trying to escape this thing that had them trapped with their limbs soon seemed to fold

17:46.000 --> 17:53.480
Into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop that began sliding across the ground toward Keith who?

17:53.600 --> 17:56.400
Promptly Wile E. Coyote the fuck out of there

17:57.280 --> 18:02.400
Back in the splashylvania parking lot the strange camera's green light was lit

18:02.880 --> 18:08.980
John took a picture causing a blindingly bright flash of light and he instantly saw black

18:09.400 --> 18:14.480
Viscous goo dripping from the camera all over his hands, and then it was gone

18:15.000 --> 18:21.560
The picture was of a short balding man with large eyes and a tiny nose

18:21.880 --> 18:28.320
He was bent over head and hands and stocks made of a shiny black material and the word

18:28.800 --> 18:32.520
Fool was branded into his forehead

18:33.600 --> 18:38.460
Clark recognized this man as they're missing John Peters

18:39.920 --> 18:46.360
Drew Andrews texted John back with the translation of the mysterious man's binary message it read

18:46.360 --> 18:48.720
I killed the Chiefs pops John

18:49.720 --> 18:54.120
Before they called it a day Keith went to the clinic and acquired a wheelchair

18:54.600 --> 18:59.640
That night these three contentioned police officers had some strange dreams

19:04.600 --> 19:06.600
John Lee petty more the fourth

19:06.800 --> 19:13.640
You're reliving the moment when you saw the black sludge on your hands and dripping from the odd camera and picture

19:13.880 --> 19:21.400
Your perception changes and you're out of your body looking at yourself staring intently at your own hands

19:22.220 --> 19:29.000
You see there's the same viscous muck dripping from your eyes and nostrils

19:29.240 --> 19:31.240
As you wake up in bed

19:32.400 --> 19:36.460
Keith vigna, you see a woman standing before you in your bedroom

19:37.120 --> 19:42.220
She's wearing old-timey clothing and she stares angrily at you

19:42.300 --> 19:47.980
She lunges toward you picking you up and throwing you into the ground and you fall

19:48.220 --> 19:52.080
Into the floor of your bedroom and then wake up in bed

19:52.780 --> 19:54.200
Clark Bishop

19:54.200 --> 19:56.200
You see a man underneath you

19:56.920 --> 20:04.660
Struggling to breathe as you tighten your grip around his neck you look up after the life leaves his eyes

20:05.220 --> 20:11.960
And see an empty dark alleyway as you wake up on the couch with infomercials playing on your TV

20:12.920 --> 20:14.780
The next day was December 3rd

20:14.780 --> 20:22.260
The officers broke into g10 g11 and g12 John Peters storage units at a plus storage

20:23.140 --> 20:30.440
G10 was filled with crates stacked three high each crate was wooden and stamped US military on the side

20:31.220 --> 20:35.020
Inside these crates were guns ammunition and heavy weaponry

20:35.140 --> 20:38.860
This included pistols shotguns rifles a shoulder-mounted

20:39.740 --> 20:45.460
anti-aircraft weapon an EMP rifle a grappling gun a small gun that shoots tracers

20:45.660 --> 20:51.660
Lots of grenades a sniper rifle a very tiny but very powerful gun and a drone

20:51.920 --> 20:55.980
There was also a pallet on which was sitting a large cube-shaped

20:56.580 --> 21:01.020
Object covered in so much plastic wrap that its contents were obfuscated

21:01.340 --> 21:07.180
The large cube-shaped object was in fact bricks upon bricks of cocaine

21:08.140 --> 21:09.460
precisely

21:09.460 --> 21:14.840
479 bricks of cocaine worth around 12 million dollars John took a brick

21:15.380 --> 21:19.460
Immediately inside g11 was a burlap sack containing

21:20.580 --> 21:26.640
$50,000 in shredded blue dye stained banknotes a piece of notebook paper with poorly drawn

21:26.860 --> 21:29.400
diagrams and nearly illegible writing

21:30.240 --> 21:33.720
225 pound bags of potatoes a ziplock bag

21:34.120 --> 21:40.600
containing five bulbs of garlic a garlic crusher an empty test tube and a syringe a small

21:40.960 --> 21:44.240
drawstring Nike bag a 3 million candlepower

21:44.840 --> 21:49.260
handheld spotlight a well-filled toolbox a black leather backpack

21:49.840 --> 21:57.040
containing a set of lock picks wire cutters wire strippers a crimping tool flat and Phillips head screwdrivers and a

21:57.040 --> 22:04.640
lockout tool a bottle of caffeine pills a carton of cigarettes three shovels a small digital scale a syringe labeled morphine a

22:04.680 --> 22:09.120
handful of ski masks walkie-talkies and a burned CD labeled

22:09.640 --> 22:11.640
monster mash mash

22:12.480 --> 22:16.600
Inside g12 was a four-wheeler with dried dirt and clay

22:17.000 --> 22:24.080
Caked all over the thing as well as a couple of plastic trunks near the door was a small chunk of paper that had been

22:24.200 --> 22:30.480
Folded into the size of a business card against the back wall was a small table with some more papers on it

22:30.600 --> 22:37.680
The small chunk of paper on the floor was a bedding guide and inside were some more ripped up bedding stubs

22:38.240 --> 22:40.240
someone lost

22:40.640 --> 22:46.720
$5,000 on October 31st the three names to bet on were Oz mayhem wolf miles

22:47.120 --> 22:52.500
Detonator Carver and Carl blitzkrieg Anderson at the bottom it said

22:53.020 --> 22:56.000
Tonight versus planet juggernaut

22:56.460 --> 23:04.540
The stubs were all losers a five-to-one bet then a six-to-one bet then finally a thirty-to-one bet

23:04.900 --> 23:11.620
Inside one of the trunks was a box of assorted batteries spools of electrical wiring three

23:12.060 --> 23:18.020
disassembled handguns and an impossibly clean machete sitting atop three full suits

23:18.500 --> 23:24.460
Including shirt tie and shoes all covered in dirt clay and black stains

23:24.740 --> 23:30.540
That look to be blood there was a note handwritten on a scrap piece of paper that read

23:31.020 --> 23:37.380
The cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of the trail about 2.5 miles

23:38.260 --> 23:42.260
Dash-k we took care of nine of them as well as the leader

23:42.580 --> 23:46.060
There was also a sheet that seemed to be ripped out of a notebook

23:46.260 --> 23:49.700
It was handwritten as well, but in different handwriting and it said

23:50.380 --> 23:55.440
The work is difficult in particular, but I've had 12 successes

23:56.140 --> 24:01.580
Life isn't as complex as they believe they are quite simple

24:01.580 --> 24:09.660
It will be their downfall and the last piece of paper was a cutout from the contention Chronicle from 25 years ago an

24:09.740 --> 24:15.100
ad that read Kohl's orphanage new school under modern etiquette

24:15.260 --> 24:19.220
We are here to serve the beautiful community of contention

24:19.780 --> 24:25.260
None of the rogue police officers remembered the name of that orphanage though. The coal name was familiar

24:26.220 --> 24:32.340
Silas Cole was one of the founders of this town and he was the owner of the mine for a couple of years

24:32.540 --> 24:37.540
His wife Mary Cole did a lot of good in the town and the library was named after her

24:37.540 --> 24:43.000
The school was called Silas Cole K through 12 and there was a Cole's Creek as well as the three

24:43.200 --> 24:50.720
Approached the other plastic trunk in g12 this one with the lid fastened. The stench was nearly

24:51.320 --> 24:57.500
Unbearable it was decided they would wait to open this trunk back at the office after having a u-haul delivered

24:57.840 --> 25:05.000
Pettimore Bishop and vigna packed up everything contained in these storage units and brought it all back to the police station

25:05.840 --> 25:09.640
the awfully pungent trunk was clear and

25:10.000 --> 25:17.520
Before opening the lid they could only see a dried black crust which was painted on every bit of the trunk sides

25:17.920 --> 25:25.840
When they opened it the rancid smell of old metal hit their nostrils and atop this pile of what looked like a messily

25:25.840 --> 25:27.840
chopped up human body

25:28.400 --> 25:34.680
Sat a woman's head split down the middle and pulled apart with a small silver sphere

25:34.800 --> 25:42.040
Sitting in between the two halves Keith took a picture John pocketed this small silver sphere

25:43.840 --> 25:48.920
Before heading out to the woods drew was tasked with looking into finding information about Cole's

25:49.120 --> 25:55.760
Orphanage and also finding someone who could understand the machinery in the diagram out in the woods the contention

25:55.760 --> 25:59.200
Police officers found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground

26:00.040 --> 26:07.120
Realized they were being watched freaked out wrecked the four-wheeler ran into trees and overall just super fucked up

26:07.320 --> 26:14.520
Topped off by Clark flying a drone into himself after their failed nature excursion

26:14.520 --> 26:20.940
They went to Julie Maxwell's wore her taxidermy and found a circled the yellow pages ad for dr

26:20.940 --> 26:26.260
Marie Jacobs as well as a receipt from Forgotten Treasures a local flea market

26:26.860 --> 26:33.300
Aftergotten Treasures they learned that the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from Mildred Mitchell's booth

26:33.460 --> 26:37.820
But Mildred was unaware of any items recently sold at her booth

26:37.900 --> 26:43.060
She told the boys it must have been her granddaughter till DB who came downstairs at that exact moment

26:43.180 --> 26:47.600
But the sight of cops spooked her and she bolted back upstairs and into her room

26:47.700 --> 26:51.660
When Clark busted until DB Mitchell had a crazed look in her eyes

26:51.780 --> 26:57.500
She slammed a large bullet into the chamber and squeezed the trigger on this odd-looking

26:58.420 --> 27:01.960
Revolver there was an almost blinding flash of light

27:02.340 --> 27:07.540
Illuminating everything and then as if she had never been there the girl was gone

27:08.380 --> 27:12.420
Clark just saw an odd gun fall to the floor confused

27:12.420 --> 27:17.620
He checked the closet and under the bed for the missing girl unsurprisingly with no luck

27:18.540 --> 27:20.540
The very anti

27:20.540 --> 27:25.980
antiheroes of this story then went to Forgotten Treasures to ask more questions and they

27:26.140 --> 27:33.300
Eventually bullied the nice lady there until she put her own life in danger by telling these cops about the drunk man who threatened her

27:33.780 --> 27:39.700
They left after they got what they wanted and the white Toyota they had been searching for was right outside

27:39.940 --> 27:47.600
It peeled out onto the road after a short dangerous pursuit. The white Toyota was bested tireless and boxed in

27:47.820 --> 27:53.100
Bullets were whizzing past him. So Keith Vigna attempted to fire a warning shot with his shotgun

27:53.740 --> 27:58.420
However, this warning shot promptly killed the driver Charles Donovan

27:58.580 --> 28:06.320
John Lee Pettymore fired shots into the air to disperse the growing crowd and a few stray bullets also hit Clark's tires

28:07.140 --> 28:12.580
Inside the white Toyota they found two guns a wallet with ID for Billy Harrison a

28:13.020 --> 28:18.180
Rifle and keys with a Dodge logo on the deceased man's person

28:18.180 --> 28:25.020
They found ID from the city for Charles Donovan and a piece of paper with the addresses of both

28:25.100 --> 28:28.260
John Peters's house and the piston pig farm

28:28.580 --> 28:35.460
The keys in the ignition included a key to a room at Hotel Motel and a key fob for the rewards

28:35.580 --> 28:42.380
Program at dirty dog grooming the dead driver's body had scratches all over the arm's hand

28:42.780 --> 28:45.900
Legs and face they were not claw marks

28:45.900 --> 28:54.020
They were not from brush John recognized these scratches as the pattern of human hands and the trunk was a

28:54.300 --> 28:58.900
Tied-up and unconscious man who matched the picture in the ID for Billy Harrison

28:59.800 --> 29:04.740
Additionally, there was a police uniform a set of scrubs in a black suit in these clothes

29:04.740 --> 29:07.860
They found a contention badge for an officer

29:08.340 --> 29:11.900
Kissel an ID in the scrubs that said dr

29:11.900 --> 29:18.840
Zebrowski and inside a pocket of the black suit or FBI credentials for an agent parks

29:19.300 --> 29:23.940
They called an ambulance and Keith asked the medics to look at his foot first

29:24.420 --> 29:31.080
Still worried about his recovery Keith took the ambulance to the contention clinic with the unconscious bald man

29:31.500 --> 29:35.140
Clark's final words to Keith before the ambulance doors shut

29:35.740 --> 29:37.740
Keep him cuffed

29:38.100 --> 29:42.060
Officers Bishop and petty more headed to the suburbs to chat with dr

29:42.060 --> 29:47.740
Marie Jacobs when they saw an unkempt man James the mill worker in rubber waders

29:48.300 --> 29:53.460
Frantically vacuuming his lawn from across the street two children stared

29:54.300 --> 29:55.380
unblinking

29:55.380 --> 30:00.140
Horrified as the unkempt James began to float up into the air

30:00.360 --> 30:07.060
Clark and John each grabbed a leg but the man continued to rise John called the two kids into action one holding

30:07.260 --> 30:13.620
Desperately onto the vacuum as the other sucked up this unknown substance with the hose their plans seemed to work

30:13.620 --> 30:19.340
All feet were now grounded in this oily sludge poured itself away down into the sewage drain

30:20.060 --> 30:22.180
but then the vacuum

30:22.700 --> 30:27.660
exploded engulfing the twin children in its contents this viscous ichor

30:28.460 --> 30:32.260
As the fourth graders folded into the writhing mass

30:32.420 --> 30:38.540
James the mill worker lost his shit and wriggled free from Clark's helping grasp turned restraint

30:38.860 --> 30:44.660
when John pulled up next to the on-the-run unkempt man in rubber waders James looked the

30:45.100 --> 30:48.380
mustachioed copper in the face and then broke

30:49.020 --> 30:56.780
Completely the mill worker sprinted back home on the same street leaving Clark Bishop and John Lee petty more the fourth right outside their initial

30:57.140 --> 31:00.360
destination the home of dr. Marie Jacobs

31:00.560 --> 31:04.560
At the contention clinic Billy Harrison finally woke up

31:04.560 --> 31:08.120
He had a concussion and had been unconscious for some time

31:08.480 --> 31:14.400
Cuffed to the bed with officer Keith Vigna asking him a bunch of questions Billy answered slowly

31:14.640 --> 31:20.660
He didn't remember some things. He was 31 years old. He remembered going to John Peters's house

31:20.920 --> 31:26.560
John John was an old friend who hadn't responded to his messages or answered the phone in a couple days

31:26.800 --> 31:32.460
They played video games together Billy remembered looking in the window and John didn't answer the door

31:33.360 --> 31:40.100
Billy didn't know a Charles Donovan Keith told Billy he was tied up in the back of this Charles person's car

31:40.760 --> 31:46.840
Billy said he drove a white van to John's house earlier that day Billy said he's on leave from the army

31:47.040 --> 31:49.780
Billy said he doesn't know any dog groomers

31:50.480 --> 31:55.560
Then Billy asked to be uncuffed since he was the victim of a crime

31:56.200 --> 31:58.320
Now do you think Keith Vigna a

31:59.440 --> 32:01.440
reacted rationally or

32:01.640 --> 32:02.800
B

32:02.800 --> 32:09.840
Escalated the situation became hostile and tried to handcuff Billy's other hand if you answered B

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
Congratulations, that's exactly right

32:13.440 --> 32:19.080
And because it's Keith Vigna when he went to handcuff Billy's free hand the one-handed concussed

32:19.200 --> 32:25.320
Probable victim of kidnapping got the drop on the officer pulled Keith's gun from its holster and threatened to shoot

32:25.720 --> 32:31.620
Keith understood in this moment that Billy was willing to pull the trigger and so Keith surrendered

32:32.220 --> 32:39.780
Officer beans unlocked Billy Harrison's handcuff and turned around which allowed the bald fit man to not Keith the fuck out

32:40.840 --> 32:47.760
Back in the suburbs Clark Bishop and John Lee petty more the fourth had a rough go trying to get any information from dr

32:47.760 --> 32:50.720
Marie Jacobs who did not want to open the front door

32:50.900 --> 32:55.400
She asked if they had a warrant Clark remembering she bought the radio asked about it

32:55.400 --> 32:57.700
And she told them the radio wasn't even there anymore

32:58.220 --> 33:01.840
Apparently a tall drunk man came and took it by force

33:02.240 --> 33:07.080
With a gun John decided they had reasonable suspicion for search and seizure

33:07.120 --> 33:09.500
So he knocked down the door gun

33:10.040 --> 33:14.840
Obviously drawn the Jacobs house was a wreck and there was a haze in the air

33:15.000 --> 33:19.880
Clark and John could hear Marie talking down in the basement in this mad

33:20.560 --> 33:27.560
Scientists house there was something covering every piece of counter space jars and beakers were sitting everywhere

33:27.560 --> 33:29.560
It smelled absolutely

33:29.920 --> 33:31.920
terrible kind of like shit

33:32.520 --> 33:36.880
John found a litter box, but the fecal matter inside looked

33:38.720 --> 33:39.840
Human

33:39.840 --> 33:42.000
This was the moment John decided dr

33:42.000 --> 33:47.800
Jacobs was for sure a witch Clark and John heard a man's voice meow in the basement

33:48.240 --> 33:55.560
Quite the sight in comparison to her usual state. Dr. Jacobs had mascara all over her face and was wearing white coveralls and

33:56.280 --> 33:57.720
neoprene gloves

33:57.720 --> 34:04.760
After making eye contact with John for the first time the incredulous and crazed doctor invited him to join her in the kitchen

34:05.320 --> 34:11.720
John and Clark having seen enough arrested and handcuffed dr. Marie Jacobs, but then she hollered

34:12.280 --> 34:14.280
she hollered

34:15.960 --> 34:21.640
And a glumping sound could be heard of something or someone

34:22.640 --> 34:28.240
Bounding up the stairs on the evening of December 3rd officer Keith Vigna

34:28.240 --> 34:32.300
Woke up wearing a thin gown with both of his wrists

34:32.440 --> 34:36.920
Handcuffed to the sides of the hospital bed where Billy Harrison was recently confined

34:37.560 --> 34:42.480
Keith's uniform Keith's gear and Billy Harrison were nowhere to be seen

34:42.800 --> 34:49.080
However, the door to this room was now open and a decent amount of the clinic staff was standing around just outside

34:49.880 --> 34:52.240
Some of them were pointing their phones at Keith

34:52.240 --> 34:57.200
All of them were laughing a few phrases murmured loud enough to make out included

34:57.280 --> 35:02.040
No wonder William was so embarrassed by him and oh isn't that Keith beans?

35:02.400 --> 35:06.080
What's he calling himself now when they actually noticed Keith waking up

35:06.080 --> 35:13.040
They awkwardly shuffled away and a young woman came into the room with bolt cutters and broke the links on the cuffs leaving officer Keith

35:13.040 --> 35:19.720
Vigna with a pair of nice iron bracelets after collecting himself Keith checked the security footage and

35:20.080 --> 35:24.880
Watched Billy Harrison walk right out the front door wearing his uniform

35:25.520 --> 35:28.680
Back in the suburbs John had handcuffed. Dr

35:28.680 --> 35:35.520
Marie Jacobs and something was running up the stairs that something was a bloody man wearing only

35:35.920 --> 35:42.680
Briefs and a collar and he galloped up the stairs on all fours before tackling Clark into the ground

35:42.960 --> 35:46.260
John kicked the man off Clark who recognized. Dr.

35:46.260 --> 35:53.240
Marie Jacobs's husband Doug Jacobs from the family portraits around the house that included the couple and their black cat Salem

35:53.640 --> 36:00.920
After they handcuffed Doug John asked dr. Jacobs why her husband is a cat man named Salem and Marie was like

36:00.920 --> 36:02.920
Oh, so, you know

36:03.060 --> 36:09.420
When asked why the officers arrived John said it was illegal to have a cat in a man's body. Dr

36:09.420 --> 36:11.420
Jacobs argued there were no laws

36:11.440 --> 36:18.480
Disallowing this sort of activity and preferring the current situation. She asked the cops to leave her be they claimed they just wanted information

36:18.960 --> 36:26.360
So she told them she believed the radio did it the radio she purchased at Forgotten Treasures the officers wanted the radio

36:26.480 --> 36:33.180
But like she said it was stolen a tall drunk man broke in punched poor Salem in the face and stole the radio

36:34.160 --> 36:37.680
With coercion and a cat toy Clark and John got dr

36:37.680 --> 36:43.960
Marie Jacobs and the cat Salem and the body of Doug Jacobs into the back of their police cruiser took them into the station

36:44.240 --> 36:51.860
Made a human-sized cat bed in one of the cells and locked up the pair in the only cell not full of contraband from John

36:51.860 --> 36:54.480
Peters's units at a plus storage

36:55.560 --> 37:02.440
John went to pick Keith up at the clinic and found him standing outside in a hospital gown wearing handcuffs with the chain cut

37:02.680 --> 37:08.240
Back at the station Clark forced drew to come to terms with Doug Jacobs being a cat man

37:08.640 --> 37:12.320
After everyone reconvene drew had a word with John alone

37:13.040 --> 37:18.800
Apparently Lauren the fourth and only other member of the contingent police department was

37:18.920 --> 37:22.440
Confused about the amount of blood and gore at splashylvania

37:23.160 --> 37:28.000
Drew said he told her a deer fell off a water slide and

37:28.400 --> 37:33.880
Then he asked if it had something to do with all the cocaine locked up in the jail cell

37:34.400 --> 37:39.840
He continued figuring John might be interested in unloading the whole pallet for around

37:40.280 --> 37:45.260
Ten million dollars drew had a contact in the city called the Duke

37:45.960 --> 37:49.860
They walked back in to talk to Clark and Keith and John said he had good news

37:50.640 --> 37:53.040
Drew had fixed the four-wheeler

37:53.840 --> 37:59.120
Following the lead of the room key from Hotel Motel found in Charles Donovan's possession

37:59.120 --> 38:03.760
The three officers busted into the deceased man's room at Hotel Motel

38:04.360 --> 38:07.080
guns drawn and without a warrant

38:07.560 --> 38:12.800
There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character the Fonz

38:13.560 --> 38:21.120
This woman we now know as Rosemary flinged a knife at officer Vigna and hid on the other side of the bed

38:21.480 --> 38:26.380
Keith ran up and engaged her in hand-to-hand combat which resulted in a hostage situation

38:27.000 --> 38:32.060
Knife to his throat officer Vigna proceeded to brag about killing her coworker

38:32.980 --> 38:41.300
Thankfully for his throat though the level-headed and highly persuasive officer Bishop managed to keep Rosemary from killing him there on the spot

38:41.300 --> 38:45.340
By getting her talking Clark asked if she knew Charles they had worked together

38:46.100 --> 38:53.060
Rosemary laughed and asked if they know who they're fucking with because they were fucking with Marvin Glass

38:53.620 --> 38:56.020
the mob kingpin in the city

38:56.660 --> 39:00.940
When asked about the radio she thought maybe the thing in the bathroom was a radio

39:01.260 --> 39:03.260
Charles had brought it back but more importantly

39:03.740 --> 39:11.980
Marvin sent them there to find out what happened to Jermaine Glass and Alfred Glass when they came to collect money from John Peters

39:12.660 --> 39:20.180
Only Alfred came back, but he came back a blubbering idiot. He wouldn't shut up about some gun. He sounded like a lunatic

39:20.900 --> 39:28.380
The wiry old lady made a run for it and leapt over the railing and into the Hotel Motel parking lot all three officers

39:28.700 --> 39:32.480
Unloaded their weapons from the second floor corridor bringing her down

39:33.020 --> 39:35.060
Barely before she could get into her vehicle

39:35.560 --> 39:43.580
The boys in blue patched her up called an ambulance and sent her to the city hospital with Lauren the fourth and only other

39:43.920 --> 39:51.640
Contention police officer with that they planned a sting operation based around a false radio call to catch Billy

39:51.820 --> 39:56.520
Harrison the stranger running around contention in an official police uniform

39:56.760 --> 40:01.040
They figured he like everyone else wanted John Peters

40:01.840 --> 40:07.760
Unfortunately for the CPD the FBI was watching and also wanted to talk to John Peters

40:08.380 --> 40:15.960
Strangely though agents Kennedy and McKinley a young woman with an erratic accent and an old man with empty eyes

40:16.280 --> 40:20.760
Were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it

40:21.080 --> 40:23.880
They thought John Peters would know where this bag was

40:24.120 --> 40:29.240
They were correct in this line of thinking as there was indeed a black Nike bag in unit

40:29.480 --> 40:33.360
G11 at a plus storage to which John Peters held the key

40:34.200 --> 40:41.080
After some verbal dancing the federal agents agreed to meet the contention squad the following morning

40:41.100 --> 40:48.160
December 4th at the police department when the officers met back up at the station to figure out what to do with their illegal seizures

40:48.280 --> 40:51.120
Drew was uncommonly not at his desk

40:51.520 --> 40:55.040
Replaced instead by a note telling them he went to the chief's house

40:55.600 --> 40:58.160
officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the

40:58.560 --> 41:05.520
Undocumented loot to their individual residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on drew in the entrance of chief

41:05.520 --> 41:08.060
Maggie cooks home Keith found two

41:08.500 --> 41:16.280
Unconscious men drew Andrews and an unknown with ID for a Harold Dorsey from the city in the living room

41:16.280 --> 41:19.480
He saw chief Maggie cooks body in full uniform

41:20.080 --> 41:27.280
Slumped against the wall a large chef's knife rested in her left hand her face had been stabbed

41:27.920 --> 41:30.960
Repeatedly and her left foot was missing

41:31.720 --> 41:33.720
That's when he noticed the smell

41:33.960 --> 41:37.120
gasoline and natural gas in the kitchen an

41:37.400 --> 41:43.520
unkempt man was at the table hunched over with a fork in one hand and a pistol in the other a

41:43.720 --> 41:50.520
Bullet hole in his head had left him face down in a plate of meat his left foot was also missing

41:51.120 --> 41:56.480
Gas cans sat all over the place and the contents had clearly been poured on

41:57.320 --> 42:03.360
Everything the range had all four burners turned all the way up and a skillet sat atop

42:03.960 --> 42:09.500
Inside were the leftovers of two feet that had the meat pulled from them

42:10.180 --> 42:14.940
He threw up and fell to his hands and knees his hand hit a wire

42:15.060 --> 42:19.220
He heard a click and saw a fire near the front door and a path of gasoline

42:19.540 --> 42:27.580
Heading back toward the kitchen with just enough time to save one person Keith dragged drew Andrews out the front door as the entire

42:28.140 --> 42:29.620
house

42:29.620 --> 42:34.420
Exploded knocking Keith into the front yard and rendering him unconscious

42:36.180 --> 42:38.180
Keith

42:38.540 --> 42:40.540
Standing in your childhood home

42:40.620 --> 42:41.980
It's your birthday

42:41.980 --> 42:46.660
And your friends are standing around this table waiting for you to blow out the candles on your cake

42:46.740 --> 42:50.500
You look up and see your parents in the corner talking to your little brother

42:50.820 --> 42:58.300
You squeeze your eyes tightly as you blow out your candles and as you do you see that black shiny viscous sludge

42:58.900 --> 43:06.080
Inside this muck are two thrashing bodies their hands reach out trying to escape this thing that has trapped them

43:06.120 --> 43:14.140
But the struggle does not last long their limbs seem to fold into this ooze becoming one with the sentient mass of goop

43:14.140 --> 43:18.240
That is now sliding across the ground toward you opening your eyes

43:18.240 --> 43:23.120
You see all of your peers around your childhood kitchen table laughing at you

43:23.120 --> 43:30.520
The candles are still lit you look up your parents are poorly attempting to hold back laughter. You look at the cake

43:30.520 --> 43:31.240
It's gone

43:31.280 --> 43:36.560
You have a plate that is clean and you look around and see everyone else is eating a piece of cake

43:36.560 --> 43:43.620
They're all laughing and begin to chant while pointing at you beans beans Keith beans his only friends are

43:43.920 --> 43:49.000
figurines beans beans keys beans will blow your friends to smithereens

43:49.640 --> 43:51.640
Your parents look at you

43:51.760 --> 43:55.960
Disgusted and turn and walk out of the room you run to follow them

43:56.040 --> 44:02.440
But looking ahead you only see that woman dressed in old-timey clothing looking down you fall

44:02.960 --> 44:07.640
Fall into a black hole in the ground and you're standing in a cold

44:08.120 --> 44:15.380
Dark room the lights begin to flicker on and you see massive tanks the size of grain silos

44:15.760 --> 44:22.780
Standing right before you is yourself. You walk up to you the face of the other you begins to age

44:23.260 --> 44:31.100
Rapidly and then just as rapidly ages in reverse you walk up to one of the massive tanks in this dank dimly lit room

44:31.220 --> 44:35.680
You press your face against it to see its contents and something

44:36.140 --> 44:42.140
Creeps toward you and as it's about to come into focus you wake up to the sound of sirens

44:42.580 --> 44:48.820
officers Bishop and petty more were soon called to the Chiefs house after it had exploded leaving behind

44:49.500 --> 44:56.580
The burned bodies of Harold Dorsey chief Maggie cook and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head

44:56.700 --> 44:59.540
And his face in a pile of foot meat that man

44:59.860 --> 45:06.240
We now know was James the mill worker the three cops decided they needed to go to dr

45:06.240 --> 45:12.780
Millar the dentist and contention to verify and match the dental records of the three deceased folks

45:13.220 --> 45:20.040
Clark looked in the Chiefs car and it was clean the glove box was empty the dashcam been unplugged

45:20.460 --> 45:27.700
Clark checked the GPS history chief Maggie Cook's cruiser had been at the mill on the other side of the city

45:27.820 --> 45:30.340
since the evening of December 1st

45:31.380 --> 45:34.380
That night the strange dreams

45:35.140 --> 45:37.780
continued John Lee petty more the fourth

45:38.740 --> 45:40.540
The sky is dark

45:40.540 --> 45:43.460
But the ground begins to give light to the world

45:43.900 --> 45:50.060
You see a man in the distance with his head and hands and stocks that sit on an inky black

45:50.100 --> 45:58.380
Stage as you walk toward this man the ground becomes wider and wider like a screens brightness level being gradually turned up

45:58.620 --> 46:03.740
You hear a holler from behind you and when you turn around you see your mother she looks

46:04.420 --> 46:08.100
She looks like she did when she was about your age and she's crying

46:08.780 --> 46:15.220
She looks past you and the door appears in between you but you can hear her say I'm so sorry

46:15.900 --> 46:21.620
He's just so beautiful. You don't have to do this. We can leave we can run

46:21.860 --> 46:28.780
The door floats up into the sky and sitting behind it is that trunk you locked up in the police department with the woman

46:28.940 --> 46:30.940
split head atop the black

46:31.060 --> 46:32.540
Putrid hacked-up

46:32.540 --> 46:36.860
Anatomy you turn around and you're face to face with a man in the stocks

46:37.060 --> 46:42.220
John Peters his forehead burned and peeling with the word fool

46:43.360 --> 46:47.380
Desperate his eyes widen and he whispers, please

46:48.140 --> 46:50.140
It's coming

46:50.180 --> 46:55.260
They are playing the roles of greater men. You have to save everyone

46:56.140 --> 46:58.140
It is coming

47:00.940 --> 47:02.940
You

47:03.500 --> 47:05.460
Clark Bishop

47:05.460 --> 47:08.180
You're walking through a parking lot you look down

47:08.500 --> 47:14.580
You see you're carrying a piece of old parchments rolled up with a neat little string tied tightly around it

47:14.980 --> 47:19.460
Looking up you hand it to the cashier at your local grocery store. You like this guy

47:19.980 --> 47:24.260
Starting to scan the scroll, but it's not beeping. He looks at you and chuckles

47:24.700 --> 47:26.700
This is going to cost you greatly

47:27.140 --> 47:32.700
as you walk out of the grocery store you step into the sanctuary of a church during a funeral a

47:32.900 --> 47:40.060
young boy with an enormous forehead in the darkest eyes you've ever seen is walking up to you and tears are

47:40.540 --> 47:46.660
streaming down his face as he stares into your eyes you hear a small voice inside you that says

47:47.180 --> 47:53.700
Please sir as the crying boy holds out his hands as you hand the scroll to the young boy

47:53.700 --> 47:56.620
You begin to hear cries throughout the sanctuary

47:56.620 --> 48:00.440
You're standing in as you look around the congregation is trying to run away

48:00.440 --> 48:06.380
But they're melting into the floor you look down and you two are melting into the floor when you look up

48:06.380 --> 48:12.100
The boy has been replaced by Tildi B Mitchell who looks down at you with her finger pointed at you like a gun

48:12.500 --> 48:18.740
She disappears and reappears over and over again as you slowly sink into the floor as your eyes

48:18.900 --> 48:21.940
Look to the ceiling of the chapel you hear a voice

48:22.620 --> 48:27.580
Inside you say let go as you wake up in bed

48:29.560 --> 48:33.620
John awoke to a text from Drew Andrews it reads

48:33.980 --> 48:39.700
Clark came by last night when no one was at the station. He warned me not to go to the cheese house

48:40.100 --> 48:46.320
He was limping, but he wasn't limping later. What is going on and where is all the cake?

48:46.820 --> 48:50.920
There was also a text from Keith explicitly asking John for drugs

48:51.240 --> 48:58.220
He rolled out of bed bagged up some coke and headed into the police station for work and a meeting with the FBI

48:59.680 --> 49:05.420
Without a reply from officer petty more confirming he would bring some of the cocaine officer vigna

49:05.720 --> 49:10.400
Drove up and broke into John Lee petty Moore's house to find it. This was cocaine

49:10.400 --> 49:15.040
They stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of a missing person

49:15.560 --> 49:19.520
At the station a news report played over the radio a

49:19.840 --> 49:24.300
Fire at the city hospital had claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals

49:24.800 --> 49:29.560
The names of the deceased are not being released yet more importantly to the officers

49:29.560 --> 49:33.680
However was the decision of what to order for breakfast

49:34.360 --> 49:38.160
Finally deciding on bishops big bean breakfast from beans on beans

49:39.480 --> 49:44.040
Drew remembered that two children were reported missing from the suburbs

49:44.360 --> 49:48.160
Aiden and Alice little John and Clark shot each other

49:48.600 --> 49:53.440
Glance and then John changed the subject to the matter of a second Clark Bishop

49:53.680 --> 49:57.760
Drew explained what happened on his end Clark came in around 1 a.m

49:58.220 --> 50:03.260
Limping wearing a hoodie and jeans and told drew not to go to chief Maggie Cook's house

50:03.880 --> 50:08.180
But Clark was attempting the sting operation with John and Keith at 1 a.m

50:08.720 --> 50:14.500
The security footage showed Clark Bishop limping in and out the door in street clothes

50:15.180 --> 50:19.720
So they decided moving forward. They would use a code word to assure each other

50:19.720 --> 50:24.740
They were each dealing with the real version of themselves that code word

50:25.280 --> 50:31.620
bubble gum tree as Keith vigna pulled back into the parking lot with breakfast a blacked-out SUV

50:31.980 --> 50:38.780
Parked in agents Kennedy and McKinley hopped out from the passenger and back seats and headed in

50:39.220 --> 50:43.220
Keith grabbed the food and Nike bag and followed them into the police station

50:43.900 --> 50:50.860
Agent McKinley the old dead-eyed man scanned the office saw John started freaking out turning and sprinting away

50:51.340 --> 50:53.980
Passing Keith as he ran back out into the lot

50:54.740 --> 50:59.460
Agent Kennedy apologized for him saying their last mission went poorly and he's lost it a bit

50:59.860 --> 51:07.500
Agent Kennedy also said she's from Minnesota with a weird Irish accent. The officers said they wanted answers

51:07.620 --> 51:09.620
She promised to give information

51:10.100 --> 51:12.700
After she put something in that bag

51:13.460 --> 51:15.900
John asked if it was something strange

51:16.800 --> 51:18.000
Yes

51:18.000 --> 51:23.820
Agent Kennedy pulled out a small lockbox two inches by two inches with a combination lock on it

51:24.300 --> 51:28.540
Inside was a small metal sphere with a diameter of one inch

51:28.780 --> 51:33.780
She dropped the sphere into the bag and immediately breathed a sigh of relief

51:34.380 --> 51:36.380
Clark looked into the bag

51:36.380 --> 51:38.540
Nothing. He asked about the ball

51:39.220 --> 51:42.820
She said it's why agent McKinley is so unintelligible now

51:43.380 --> 51:50.020
So John called agent Kennedy to the back of the station to look at their cat man when she was more intrigued than confused

51:50.660 --> 51:57.260
John freaked out and told the agent that there's a weird gun and a weird radio and a weird camera and the weird radio made

51:57.260 --> 52:02.780
That guy into a cat man. Plus there's oil all over the place agent Kennedy side

52:04.340 --> 52:07.480
She guessed that meant that they were in

52:08.540 --> 52:10.540
She'd be right back

52:10.620 --> 52:12.620
She walked out of the station

52:12.780 --> 52:15.780
And walked back in with Billy Harrison

52:16.740 --> 52:18.500
Billy Harrison

52:18.500 --> 52:20.500
the bald fit man

52:20.700 --> 52:25.180
Holding Keith's gun and belt atop his nicely folded uniform

52:25.260 --> 52:30.460
Keith grabbed his shit and walked back to his desk and Billy said he hoped Keith was feeling better

52:31.100 --> 52:36.260
Agent Kennedy dropped the bad accent and told Harrison all three officers had seen a lot of shit

52:36.440 --> 52:41.460
She knew he wanted to get home. So maybe they should just leave the number and the bag and bail

52:42.100 --> 52:46.580
He nodded Kennedy turned to the three cops and drew Andrews

52:47.620 --> 52:49.620
You're completely fucked

52:49.900 --> 52:56.300
Luckily for you all though. I'm gonna leave this bag here with you anything you put in it disappears. That's all we know about it

52:56.580 --> 53:00.740
It's a myth even within this community who have seen the unnatural at work

53:00.740 --> 53:06.160
But we have seen today all of us here that agent Victor's Nike bag is real

53:07.020 --> 53:14.460
Guys, the world does not work the way we all grew up knowing it to be you're all charged now with understanding that

53:15.060 --> 53:19.500
That understanding of the world will cause your lies to crumble

53:19.660 --> 53:26.660
But the thing that keeps us going is that daily we are saving the human race from being wiped out of existence

53:27.460 --> 53:32.420
I'm gonna leave this here with you all and you'll be given a secure location to drop it when the job is done

53:32.980 --> 53:35.140
Your job is to stop the incursion

53:35.820 --> 53:42.020
Minimize exposure save lives and cover the whole thing up to save others from being exposed

53:42.780 --> 53:47.140
We're gonna give you the same information that all newcomers game which is a phone number

53:47.580 --> 53:53.360
You give them a call when the situation is taken care of or if things get completely out of hand or they'll call in

53:53.360 --> 53:55.260
48 hours if you don't

53:55.260 --> 53:57.260
Good luck

53:57.260 --> 54:02.620
Let's go back now to the past to a young Clark Bishop in his childhood home

54:03.580 --> 54:10.520
The same home he lives in now back then the plastic was on the couch. There were angel wings and pictures of Jesus

54:11.320 --> 54:13.340
Clark is playing in the living room

54:13.340 --> 54:17.680
His parents are in the kitchen cooking and Wheel of Fortune is on like always in the background

54:18.080 --> 54:24.080
Clark's mom pulls him close to repeat her go-to motto life is like the bonus round

54:24.120 --> 54:29.880
We were already given the best letters and then she sends little Clark off to see mr

54:29.880 --> 54:34.820
Gerald fingers in at the Mary Cole library contentions public book depository

54:35.180 --> 54:41.500
With lemon poppy seed muffins in hand the library smells musty it's rarely used by the community

54:42.140 --> 54:47.500
Gary Daly owner and operator of the daily fuzz having a loud conversation with mr.

54:47.500 --> 54:55.540
Fingers and about occult books and currently open in front of him is the true and horrifying confessions of the st. Osseith witches

54:56.420 --> 55:04.220
Clark presents the poppy seed muffins and fingers and puts the baked goods with the other batches due to his gluten intolerance

55:04.820 --> 55:06.820
the phone rings

55:11.260 --> 55:13.260
Gerald answers

55:13.700 --> 55:20.220
Gerald says it was for Clark. He says the voice on the other line said that Clark has the best letters

55:21.020 --> 55:23.020
the voice sounded panicked and

55:23.900 --> 55:25.820
screamed a little

55:25.820 --> 55:27.940
Outside the sky turns dark

55:28.780 --> 55:33.100
The immediate lack of sunlight is noticed inside the Mary Cole library

55:33.740 --> 55:40.460
Strange forms of tall gaunt men begin moving around outside the library a

55:40.780 --> 55:48.320
Figure in the darkness wearing a cloak is locking the doors of the library from the outside with a massive chain

55:48.860 --> 55:52.300
He turns and runs and out of one of the windows

55:52.620 --> 55:57.940
You see a massive flash of light a gigantic shadow moves out of frame

55:57.940 --> 56:03.780
It's an enormous but thin man in a black suit sprinting away from the cloaked figure

56:04.900 --> 56:11.140
Drawed opens a window light comes back into the world and everything seems as it once was

56:12.020 --> 56:18.500
Clark looks at mr. Daly who's staring at his book Gary looks up and asks if there was a big cloud mr.

56:18.500 --> 56:25.380
Fingers and thinks the occult books must have something to do with this so Daly reads aloud what he'd been reading when it went dark

56:25.700 --> 56:26.660
And

56:26.660 --> 56:28.020
Casting her eyes aside

56:28.020 --> 56:35.740
She saw a spirit lift up a cloth line over a pot looking much like a ferret and it being asked of this

56:36.100 --> 56:38.700
Examine it why the spirit did look upon her

56:38.780 --> 56:40.900
She said it was hungry this

56:41.140 --> 56:48.220
Examine it being asked how she knew the names of mother Bennett spirits say if the Tiffin her spirit did tell this

56:48.380 --> 56:55.180
Examine it that she had two spirits the one of them like a black dog and the other red like a lion and that their

56:55.180 --> 57:01.020
Names were sucking and layered and sayeth that sucking did plague by its wife on to death and the other

57:01.100 --> 57:04.780
Plagued three of his beasts where of two of them died

57:04.780 --> 57:11.220
But before he could finish the three decide to not speak of this again when Clark arrives home

57:11.540 --> 57:17.500
When he turns the corner his mind can't quite handle what it's seeing and it begins to fragment

57:17.940 --> 57:21.940
One scene then another first he sees his house in perfect condition

57:22.460 --> 57:27.940
His consciousness changes channels and he sees police officers everywhere it flips again

57:28.220 --> 57:32.380
Everything's normal it flips again and two black sedans are outside the house

57:32.900 --> 57:37.340
Flips again. Everything's normal as he walks into the house. There's a flash

57:37.460 --> 57:41.940
He sees his parents have been lifted off the ground and are half

57:42.340 --> 57:49.340
Inside the walls of the home their faces are frozen and cold and white with the lack of blood it flips again

57:49.580 --> 57:51.100
Everything looks normal

57:51.100 --> 57:54.940
But he hears voices it flips he sees people someone says yeah

57:54.940 --> 58:00.100
We well we couldn't find the artifact and we had to get the fuck out of there cuz Karen did her goddamn

58:00.380 --> 58:06.500
Magic trick again, and then everything is normal. Then he hears whispers. Then he sees a man wearing a suit

58:06.500 --> 58:14.020
Oh shit, it's a fucking kid man Clark is sitting in a courtroom in contention and he's trying to think back on that day

58:14.020 --> 58:18.520
But he can't remember anything except for how normal it all was

58:19.420 --> 58:21.420
How his house just looked normal

58:22.060 --> 58:24.660
But empty it just weren't there anymore

58:25.300 --> 58:27.300
But here there's a woman

58:27.700 --> 58:35.340
She's on trial. She's being convicted right now for the death of Clark's parents. Her name is Anne love

58:36.020 --> 58:43.540
She's cold and vacant, but she's always smiling and her asymmetrical bangs cover one of her eyes

58:43.940 --> 58:45.940
on the stand she says

58:46.340 --> 58:49.880
Yes, I did it and I'd do it again

58:53.860 --> 59:01.800
Back in current times the officers went to the Daily Fuh after Gary Daly called in to report information about the Chiefs disappearance

59:02.380 --> 59:08.260
Gary Daly was the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and the owner operator of the Daily Fuh a

59:08.540 --> 59:10.780
Contention staple that had been around for generations

59:11.780 --> 59:13.580
Gary Daly was an older man

59:13.580 --> 59:21.560
He wore jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short sleeve button-down with tiny cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it

59:21.780 --> 59:28.300
He asked if the officers remembered when he would help watch them down at Klinker's when they were but wee little fellas and

59:28.500 --> 59:32.980
Invited them back to his office some of the art hanging in the walls of the Daily Fuh

59:32.980 --> 59:34.980
However caught the boys attention

59:35.100 --> 59:41.140
One was a circle with a star inside of it inside that star was another star and there were a couple

59:41.420 --> 59:47.540
Triangles curved lines and tiny circles as well a fun take on the chaoticness of the universe

59:48.060 --> 59:54.200
Another was a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing on the other

59:54.540 --> 01:00:01.540
It was in a bunch of old texts that Gary had seen at different museums and libraries from various cultures and eras

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.780
Another print was a black circle with six black dots

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:12.900
Surrounding it an ancient sign for a group that might have existed called the circle of knowledge

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.220
They tried to keep the world together

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:21.980
The last was a wonky question mark with two additional lines one curved and one straight

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.780
jutting down from the question marks dot a

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.340
symbol of a land unknown

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:36.360
Anyway, Gary had heard Harold Dorsey was in town and wanted a blog post at what's behind Dorsey dot blogspot.com written about the

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.500
Daily Fuh

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.500
So he was kind of sort of stalking Harold Dorsey

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.740
He followed Dorsey to the Chiefs house and saw a guy holding the chief and James at gunpoint

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:53.340
The guy with the gun was overweight wearing all black and had a big scar over his right eye

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:58.820
James was wearing rubber waders and the chief seemed off

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.740
She didn't stand up straight the way chief cook would in the phone book

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:11.440
They found an address for James Keith remembered the hunched over unkempt guy at the Chiefs house was wearing rubber

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.260
waders John

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:19.500
Remembered the unkempt man with the vacuum was wearing rubber waders and the address for James matched

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:22.900
Just down the street from dr. Marie Jacobs house

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:31.620
Let's go once again into the past to a young John Lee Pettymore the fourth just after the moment that ended his sprint car

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.520
racing career

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.980
John Lee Pettymore the fourth and Don D Pettymore John's dad's cousin

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:44.580
Are sitting in the back of an ambulance and the EMT is checking out John. She tells the young Pettymore

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.700
There's just no way he'll ever race again

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:53.460
Don grabs John's face and tells him he's got to give up on this dream now and they hug

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.540
Don pushes John in a wheelchair out to the parking lot

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.560
But from the rear Don sees two figures begin approaching

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.700
They're both extremely tall with large gaunt frames

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:11.880
They begin walking faster and faster toward the two Don starts running with the wheelchair

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:18.720
But the two figures are catching up there's no one else around they're both wearing black suits and their skin is weirdly

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.640
Translucent one of them starts screaming John hollers get at the fanciest men

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.520
He's ever seen and the Pettymore boys make it to the parking lot just in time to see their car

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:37.280
Now being flipped over by large Eddie and his pit crew John yells at large Eddie and large Eddie

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.700
Approaches the two petty Moore's Eddie swings

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.480
Don catches large Eddie's hand

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.120
Mudders under his breath and large Eddie's hand starts sizzling like a country fried steak on a Sunday morning

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:58.240
Smoke starts coming out of there Eddie screams Don holds on before dropping it and hitting him once more in the face

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.760
Eddie runs off hollering

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.320
Don helps the concussed John Lee Pettymore the fourth into their car

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:14.160
Back in the current timeline the officers went to the first Church of Contingent on the way there

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.120
They noticed a strange occurrence the creek though

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.560
It was a chilly December day was filled to the brim with animals of all sorts dogs cats possums

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.680
Raccoons town creatures of all kinds the FCC was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.920
And served by the youth group

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:42.840
Keith vigna impatient and rude broke into pastor Adam Kane's office and stole the old motorcycle helmet from off his desk

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:50.260
The helmet had some tubes on either side with one green and one red light and the red light was lit

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:50.980
But hey

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:57.540
It turns out maybe Keith is a monster to be around because his dad was a dick who clearly preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.300
Way back when they were children while playing on their family's sprawling estate

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:09.820
Keith and Ferguson heard the alarm sirens blaring as strange gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:18.300
However, they were promptly shot down by the beans security personnel that night William being sat the boys down and told them

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:24.020
What happened is exactly why they have security and he added the most important thing is

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:30.100
Ferguson safety William took Ferguson to his workshop leaving Keith to hide an eavesdrop

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.640
That's when he told Ferguson why he was so important

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.100
He said he didn't know how much longer he'd be around

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:42.980
He had hoped that he would be the one to fulfill the prophecy, but it is not him. It is Ferguson

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:47.740
Ferguson is the anointed when the time is right

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:54.100
he must go back and save the world and with that he handed Ferguson a watch and

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.780
Promised that it would fit when the time was right

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:07.500
Back in whatever year it is now the officers took the pastor's helmet to the police station and locked it up in the evidence room

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:14.300
Along with the other items from the booth at Forgotten Treasures the gun camera and radio all in separate lockers

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.260
They were all showing a red light except for the camera green light lit

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.320
Outside the station John took a picture of Keith with this glass

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:31.440
Two-blind camera and there was a massive flash of bright light and an inky black substance was all over John's hands and

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:38.560
Dripping down from the camera and the picture it was pooling on the ground and they could swear it was moving

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.620
Then they blinked and the substance was gone

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.400
John's hands were clean and he was just holding this odd device and even odder

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:54.800
Picture the camera's light was red again and the picture showed two men in a room made of darkness

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.760
They could barely make out the two figures in the picture

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.240
Thanks to the light from a small candle also made out of a substance without color

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.040
The candle was sitting on a table made of the same

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.240
unbelievably black texture of the two men one was a slender muscular man in a black t-shirt

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.840
Revealing tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands to his fingertips

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.840
He was kneeling before the other man who looked like a no bullshit actual cowboy

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.600
This man this cowboy seemed to be looking into the camera

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.520
Holding his hand up to block his face from the cameras flash and sight on

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:41.480
their way to the mill on the other side of the city the officers drove on a bridge over a creek and there were loads

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.360
Of animals in the water at this part of the creek as well

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:51.200
John threw his lights on to get ahead of Clark and as he passed he saw the sky ahead begin to swirl

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:57.240
About 30 feet above the ground a flat oval began to form the sky around it

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.040
Spiraled like cloth making folds as it gathered and bunched in places

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.680
The oval was black but this technicolor energy was erupting from its darkness

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:14.600
And then just as swiftly the sky was just as it was but something was falling

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:21.940
Suddenly the windshield of John's vehicle shattered and tiny shards of glass covered everything

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:30.360
Slumped across officer petty Moore's dashboard was the lifeless body of a grown man and blood was splattered

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.680
Everywhere he lost control of the vehicle and swerved into oncoming traffic

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:42.040
Hearing the sound of a horn blaring as it roared closer and closer before the cruiser jerked to a stop

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.440
all three officers saw the flash of a car fly by and then they heard a

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.640
deafening crash and the rumble of fire in

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:57.520
the chaos it was hard to understand what all had happened a

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.660
minivan was run off the road by officer petty Moore the former teen sprint car racer who was banned from the circuit after an

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.380
accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.860
Officer Bishop slammed into the back of petty Moore's cruiser and there was fluid leaking

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:20.120
Everywhere the minivan that narrowly avoided the head-on collision with John it flipped and caught fire

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:28.560
Petty Moore worked diligently to keep the two police cruisers from exploding which likely would have killed officer vigna who couldn't handle the

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.660
situation and fell unconscious

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:36.260
Thrust into the memories of a particularly traumatic childhood Christmas

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:42.980
Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage of the minivan, but it might have already been too late

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.700
Before he could go back to save the woman trapped behind the wheel as well as the other passenger the minivan combusted

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.700
Looking at the body on John's windshield

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.420
They'd finally found their missing John Peters

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:08.180
Just hadn't expected him to fall out of the sky the balding man with large eyes and a small nose was wearing a pair of

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:11.260
Jeans and a button-down shirt and on his forehead

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:15.100
Recently branded into the skin was the word

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.420
fool

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:25.120
The ambulance arrived and firemen were seen pulling a woman's charred remains from the driver's seat of the minivan

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.640
Two others from the back of the van pulled out the body of a small girl

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.080
Drew pulled up in Keith's Cruiser because he got a call from the estate salesman at James's house

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:45.400
Apparently he found some unsettling writing and blood and many many guns after accidentally triggering some secret

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:50.280
Door trap the salesman was wondering if he could sell the guns in the estate sale

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.120
Drew had told him the police needed to look at the scene first

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.980
Drew and John then very subtly walked over to the ditch off the side of the road to speak privately

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:05.960
Drew said he received a message from the Duke the deal was going down that night at 2 a.m.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.680
John offered drew 5% to convince the Duke to do the deal out at the Pettymore farm

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:20.060
Drew and John then walked back up and they all saw a wet black cat running toward them from off the road

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:25.420
The cat seemingly panicked jumped on to John's leg and meowed like crazy

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.300
John held the cat up and told Doug they were gonna get him the help

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:36.120
He needed at this point a small but vocal group of the contention population began

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.420
Protesting and letting these officers know how they felt

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:46.900
Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like the calls about missing persons

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.820
Animals in the ponds and creeks as well as a voicemail from the feds

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.320
Doug dr. Marie Jacob's husband who is inhabiting the body of their cat Salem

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:04.940
Conveyed to the officers that the animals were hiding in the water because the oily substance could not get them in the ponds and creeks

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:11.420
And at James the mill workers house the estate salesman Randy angst dressed in a fancy blue

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:18.080
Three-piece suit holding a cane with a big tooth on the top handed the cops a card when he greeted them

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.460
The card said mr. Angst is the dentist and the estate salesman in town

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:31.600
He also founded the contention historical society when asked about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's car

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:38.860
angst noted that a few of the folks were dressed in clothes about a hundred years off from the rest when questioned about Cole's

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:45.220
Orphanage the dentist slash estate salesman recalled an orphanage by that name opening about

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:51.580
25 years prior though it did close down within a year in James the mill workers house

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.800
They found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table

01:11:55.260 --> 01:12:01.740
Riding in blood where one of the guns should be that read stop her and a large plastic tube all

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.980
Revealed after touching the bow tie of a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:14.940
There are a bunch of cleaning supplies random materials and a handwritten list hidden in a small enclave

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:23.860
behind an oil painting of a rose all the liquids had been crossed out including the three listed types of water tap

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:29.420
distilled and boiling and all of the materials had been crossed out except

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:37.740
Neoprene a kind of synthetic rubber when Clark tapped the white hard hat atop the suit of armor in the foyer

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:45.580
He found a trapdoor and fell into a 12 foot deep pit with two corpses a man and a woman in

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:54.020
One of their pockets was a paper with a hand-drawn symbol a circle encircled by six circles in the front room

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:57.700
There was a grand piano without strings and in the kitchen

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:04.380
there are a few loose tiles where something heavy metal and buried had been dragged out as

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:12.960
The place was being searched a heavy artillery weapon began firing into the house from the front yard a looming

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:15.460
Overweight man wearing an all-black

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:21.520
Combat uniform with a large scar over his right eye blasted the door from its frame

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:27.800
Almost cut officer Bishop's arm off froze at the command of officer petty more and

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:36.280
Eventually after a brutal combat between the contingent boys and the massive metal man flew out of the window bottomless

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.720
Gripping the throat of officer vigna. Thank beans

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:47.080
He poked that terminator top in the eye just in time to escape falling to the ground before the metal fella

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.800
exploded like fireworks

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:57.280
The officers cleaned themselves up after fighting this large robot man seemed to perhaps have feelings

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.800
Continuing the investigation of James the mill workers house Keith vigna found a single piece of music

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.560
entitled the rise of the end in the bench of the stringless piano

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.200
Clark Bishop found in the large plastic tube

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.600
blueprints for calm comfy campground a

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:24.480
Suspiciously planned out set of seven buildings six encircling a large one in the center on an island

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.920
sitting on Lake calm

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.180
They all stood there in James the mill workers house and the officers

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:37.520
Remembered he died in chief Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head face down in a plate of foot me

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.560
They remembered the contents of the present

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.160
She received from an unknown source the night

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:50.020
She took off a red rose a white hardhat and a black silk bowtie all of which

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:57.560
present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue respectively

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:05.360
They called Florence the fourth and only other contention police officer, but it went to voicemail immediately

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:13.420
After undressing the bottom half of the still standing robot man's legs the gang found a logo on the smooth

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.320
Pelvic area an M made of four double helices

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:29.700
Late on the night of December 4th after the weirdest dinner and wheel of fortune session Clark Bishop had ever been subject to

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:36.300
Due to his super fucking weird new co-worker Keith Vigna left the Bishop home headed back to Hotel Motel

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.720
And was approached by his niece Francis beans

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:47.340
She offered her uncle officer Vigna one million dollars from her inheritance to kill her father

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:49.680
Keith's brother

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.260
Ferguson beans upon accepting her proposal the two began driving east away from contention

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:02.820
John got home to find his place had been turned over his smoky and the bandit DVDs had been knocked and

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:09.180
Stepped on among the mess was a Burgatory rewards card for Keith Vigna

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:16.340
John vowed to kill Keith, but first he smoked a bowl and put on smoky

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.240
Drew eventually showed up holding a pistol

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.380
But by the top so John showed drew how to use the safety on his pistol

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.900
And they went out to the shooting tree to practice aiming and firing

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:35.060
With final preparations for the coke deal with the Duke in place John made a bird call and another call

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.380
replied from the woods

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.820
At 2 a.m.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:47.140
technically the morning of December 5th a white 15 passenger van pulled up to the Pettymore property with the words

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.780
Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side filled with children

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:58.020
Pulling a white trailer that also said Jesus Christ Ministries

01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:03.100
The most handsome man John had ever seen hopped out of this van

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.960
Perfect hair perfect teeth a perfect jawline

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:13.380
And he was wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:19.460
Coke was buried in two holes and John would point out where to dig when he received half the money

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:24.660
Same plan for the second half a bunch of children ran out of the van all carrying

01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:31.220
Shovels in the same way and they lined up waiting for the Duke on his command the children began digging

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:36.740
John asked if the kids all have the same mom. Yeah, you could you could say that

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:45.320
After the children loaded the cocaine into the trailer behind the van the Duke handed John the briefcase with

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.840
$5,000,000 in it same thing happened behind the woodpile as it did beneath the big tree the

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:59.360
Transaction went smoothly and John offered the Duke a thousand dollars for information about Marvin Glass

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.060
The Duke doesn't like Marvin Glass see glass is a competitor

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:09.640
But also a customer Marvin Glass buys in bulk when the Duke was asked about his rose

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.600
He said he liked the smell

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:19.260
Laughed and admitted he had no sense of smell when John asked about the kids the Duke said goodbye to Drew got back in the van

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.680
Drove down the long driveway and out onto the country road

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.000
John whistled and eight petty more cousins came walking out from the woods received their payment

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:35.640
Ten grand and a 24 pack of Keystone light each and they all fired their guns into the air in celebration

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:41.280
Back at the Bishop abode Clark heard Keith leave got up and locked the front door

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.320
Walking back to bed though

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:48.500
He looked out the window to Coles Creek which flows down south from the lake at Centennial Park

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:54.760
The whole thing was packed with animals a fair few people had been out there earlier looking for their pets

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:57.200
But not at this late hour too dark too cold

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:04.180
And they saw a humanoid figure hobbling down the frigid waterway in his direction

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:10.680
It was running but it seemed to be fighting through a limp and when it reached the point in the creek

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:17.580
Closest to Clark's house. He leapt from the water and began screaming and waving his arms all while looking directly

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.380
toward Clark's window

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:27.900
Clark's brain had a hard time comprehending what it was. He was seeing but this man this man running towards him

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:30.580
It was him

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.740
And then a warm pinch on the back of the neck

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.740
and Clark's vision tunneled to a close

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.420
Clark came to as a black bag was being snatched off his head

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.340
He felt hung over and his chest was weird and tight

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:54.500
It smelled damp and earthy and there was a haze around the torch above shedding partial light from the middle of the small

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.900
stonewalled room

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:03.900
Clark was sitting in a chair across a stone table from a man with gray hair under a white hard hat and a charcoal suit

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:10.100
With a bolo tie the man looked relaxed as he tossed the black bag onto the table and began to speak

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.440
After Richard the third's coronation

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.720
He was visited by a seer from Leichster who called himself the overseer

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.940
The seer claimed that the now king was to hold some very important knowledge

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:28.340
But would need to have the restraint to not abuse this power Richard was given this knowledge

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:30.300
But he couldn't handle it

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.140
He lost his mind and killed his two nephews

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:37.500
The overseer disappointed eventually passed the same knowledge to Henry Tudor

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.500
So he could whoop Richard at Bosworth

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.580
Henry the seventh held this power and eventually passed it down to a reliable and trusted confidant

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.840
Thankfully not his piece of shit son

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:55.140
This knowledge was passed down repeatedly abused and respected respected and abused until it made its way over the Atlantic to the colonies

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.640
Eventually landing with a high order of masons a select few held this information for generations

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.100
But a grand purpose was never found

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:09.980
Until Paul Simon the politician not the singer soon after being elected to the Senate

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:14.440
He was walking near his home when he came across the first known xenon imitode

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:20.540
He sought out Robert Byrd the Senate minority leader at the time to share his newfound understanding of the world

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:26.580
Thankfully for the world Byrd was among those carrying the knowledge of the overseer from centuries before

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:32.140
Together they formed a small circle of men to hold the weight of this realization

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:38.260
Today we carry on their tradition by keeping the darkness out of this world

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:43.820
We are the opaque rampart delaying the destruction of life as we know it

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:46.720
Welcome to the circle of knowledge

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:52.200
You have questions, I'm sure and I know this sounds hypocritical after that lengthy oration

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:58.640
But as my high school English teacher would always say show don't tell he reached under the table

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.180
And as he stood up he held up an unspeakable worm like

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:11.520
Abomination with one hand away from his body the thing was two feet long and tube like covered in a squamous black

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.360
partially translucent

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.360
membrane its body

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:17.600
Segmented and toxically green

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:23.700
Pulsating arteries and veins could be seen through its thin looking exterior. It had no

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.920
Identifiable eyes or nose its cavernous

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:34.640
Circular mouths one sitting just inside the other were lined with hooked teeth and it spit out a saliva

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.400
That was somehow darker than black

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400
You

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:49.720
Keith vigna sat in the car of his niece Francis beans a Chrysler Sebring

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.880
She'd offered him 1 million dollars to kill her father his brother Ferguson beans

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:00.680
After some back roads through the woods she pulled up to a black iron fence

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:06.640
Francis hopped out in motion for teeth to follow her she opened a hatch in the ground and jumped inside

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.640
Disappearing from view

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:16.820
Keith followed down the hatch into a dark underground tunnel lit by red lights on the walls every 15 feet

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:23.500
France told him he'll pop up on the estate in a sweet spot with no security and he'll have a straight shot to the house

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.880
Keith went up followed her directions and made his way into Ferguson's house

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.480
undetected

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:34.120
Keith searched for and found bleach ammonia and a towel

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:41.080
But when Keith walked into Ferguson's room the lights were out there were candles on either side of the bed and lit by

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:46.040
Candlelight was a woman on top of the sheets in bedware, but not Stacy

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.640
Not Ferguson's wife. This was an older woman a generation older than Ferguson and Keith

01:23:53.160 --> 01:24:00.400
She freaked out Keith calmed her down said he's a contention police officer and that he got a call that someone had broke in

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.620
She claimed she was there to meet Ferguson

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:08.840
This was Joan Robin the mother of Ferguson's business partner

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:13.960
Bruce Joan explained that Ferguson offered her a million dollars to sleep with him

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.920
So he could make your mom jokes to his business partner

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.020
Keith told her she had two options

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.420
She could leave or she could shoot Ferguson when he came into the room

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:32.560
Joan realized with Ferguson gone her son would take control of the company Keith offered her half a million dollars

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:41.120
And she accepted Keith found Ferguson's revolver handed it to Joan and a car could be heard pulling up to the house a

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:48.080
white 15 passenger van with the words Jesus Christ Ministries painted on the side pulled into the

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:55.040
pristine Circle Drive the van pulled a white trailer that also said Jesus Christ Ministries a

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:02.220
Beautiful man got out of the passenger side of the van. He had perfect hair perfect teeth a perfect jawline

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:08.960
And he was wearing the fuck out of a bright white suit with a red rose pinned perfectly to his lapel

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.960
It was Keith's brother

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.080
Ferguson beans

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:20.360
He clicked a button on his keys and as he walked toward his home the ground around the van and trailer began to move

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:26.840
And shift the entire vehicular ensemble was transported below ground on some crazy

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:34.000
Futuristic elevator of sorts as the driveway closed back up with no evidence the van or trailer had ever

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:41.280
Sat there Keith hid in the closet with the ammonia bleach and towel the door opened shut

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.080
and

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:45.080
Ferguson hollered upstairs

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.160
Joan the power out scared Joan yelled back

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
It must have been the storm

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:59.080
The door to the room opened and Keith heard a shot then a scream then another shot then a different scream then another shot

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.640
And another shot and another shot, and then Keith heard crying

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:09.800
It sounded like Joan Keith opened the door of the closet to see Ferguson on the floor in a white suit with a rose on

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.340
His lapel riddled with holes from his own gun

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.800
Joan ran to Keith and hugged him Keith started crying Joan was crying Keith told Joan to calm down and

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.560
Lay on the bed so he could clean up the scene

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.000
Joan sat at the end of the bed with her head in her hands and Keith

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.520
Keith grabbed the bleach

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:37.720
Ammonia mixed it up on the rag he walked over to Joan and tried to lock his arm behind her head and forced the rag

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.880
Over her mouth, but Joan got her hand in between her mouth and the towel Keith attacked again violently

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.080
He held her down on the bed until she passed out

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.380
Officer Keith Vigna grabbed the revolver with his handkerchief

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.200
Put it in Joan's hand held the gun to her head and pulled the trigger

01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.280
Leaving the room to look like Joan shot Ferguson five times before turning the gun on herself

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.220
Walking away Keith saw the watch on Ferguson's wrist

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:12.360
It was the same watch their dad William given Ferguson when they were kids

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.800
Keith took the watch

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.800
Noticing there's nothing on the face

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:24.300
And slipped in in his pocket when all the sudden his consciousness began changing like changing the channel

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:27.840
He began to phase out of his reality seems to be somewhere else

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.040
entirely

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.880
Keith felt wet grass and dirt on his fingers

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:39.920
He was looking at a door in the ground like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried and on the door was an inscription

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.120
It read here lies the beans

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.640
Scientists beyond measure saviors of the world

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:56.200
Keith walked back through the tunnel under the ground with the red lights with glazed eyes

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:04.700
Keith back at the hotel stuck the watch in the handkerchief into the room safe and laid down flat on his bed

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:13.060
John Lee Pettymore just successfully made five million dollars by selling cocaine to a random handsome

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:19.660
Stranger named the Duke paid him a grand to know that Marvin Glass buys from him in bulk and paid eight

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:25.060
Cousins ten grand in a 24 pack of Keystone light each to which they took a Pettymore

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:29.860
Sky-shot and headed off into the night drew walked up and said, thank you

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:34.260
Thank you for making all this money for showing him how to shoot a gun

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:39.460
With all the money drew planned on donating his house to Boys and Girls Club

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:47.340
And then it's probably just gonna bail and then drew drove off down the long driveway to the country road home alone

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.180
John wanted to kill Keith vigna

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:57.260
but he opted for leaving Keith drunk voicemails slamming three more beers snorting another line brushing his teeth and

01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:01.060
Sending Keith a text that just says I

01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.060
know

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:09.460
John then swept up his smoky DVDs put in the director's cut and fell asleep smoking and join on his couch

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.220
dreaming of his millions but also of

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.660
terrible monsters

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:17.460
He woke up to the sound of two gunshots

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:22.980
Rose Mary was holding six Pettymores and drew hostage outside

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:27.060
Two Pettymores were faced down in the dirt and she called out for John

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:34.040
He came out on his front porch with his hands up. She told him her boss Marvin Glass wants the gun

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:40.620
John John thinks they can help each other glass wants his boys back right John wants his town back, right?

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:47.340
She said she was sent to collect this gun and John asked if he could deliver it. She agreed first

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.460
She let the cousins all go free

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:54.740
Then she got John and drew into the front of Drew's Mini Cooper hopped in the back and held their own

01:29:54.940 --> 01:30:00.260
Guns at them while they drove back into town to the contention police department

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:08.120
Clark was in the circular stone room with the stone table lit by a torch

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:13.780
The man sat across from him put down the creature into a container between his legs and closed the lid

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:20.060
Before introducing himself as Leon Simpson, he welcomed Clark into the circle of knowledge

01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:28.020
Clark's first task began forthwith Leon pulled out a small plastic container and slid it toward Clark

01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:34.380
He took a gun out of his pockets a tranquilizer and in the plastic container were a pair of needles

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:38.660
Leon told Clark these darts were filled with a particular

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:43.140
Toxin to make anyone obey for some time

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:50.540
The job was this an FBI agent was on his way to contention to take over the missing persons cases as

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:54.020
This would be bad for Clark and for the circle of knowledge

01:30:54.620 --> 01:31:00.140
Clark needed to tranq this FBI agent and make sure he didn't see anything funny going on

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:06.820
Leon Simpson asked Clark what exactly had been going on that was so funny in contention and Clark

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:10.180
Clark spilt those beans

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:17.540
Leon was impressed by the sheer amount of strange information coming from Clark and so reiterated his current mission

01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:22.860
Keep the FBI agent away from any of the strangeness any of the goo or ooze or whatever

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:25.140
They're calling it. This next part was important

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:32.360
Clark had 24 hours and then Leon needed him to report back so they could make sure that he'd be okay

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:37.600
Clark asked about the creature. Leon told them it's a xenonema toad

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:44.480
Currently they believe these things are a vector either from another time another place or another reality. They're not quite positive

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:50.620
However, they're the things Paul Simon found that connected the dots to the knowledge of the overseer

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:54.160
These creatures are not of this place

01:31:54.160 --> 01:32:01.500
They have certain abilities the circle of knowledge has found a way to exploit and they are necessary kept around for a very

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:03.940
specific purpose

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:11.680
Again, Leon decided to show not tell he opened the one door in this room into another circular stone room

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.680
This one was much bigger

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:21.520
20 yards across with a domed ceiling the walls were stone and there were a handful of torches mounted to light the room

01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:28.660
There were six large slabs of stone each with a couple of people laying on them circling a single

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:34.560
Unoccupied stone slab in the center of the space each person laying down had one of those giant

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:42.180
Fucked up worm things attached to them and many of them seemed to have dead skin covering one or multiple limbs

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:48.980
There's also a woman an electric blue slacks and a bright yellow cardigan walking

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:56.060
Deliberately around each slab checking on each group and checking her watch. She smiled when she saw Clark Bishop

01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.660
Leon explained that these brave men and women

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:02.900
Motioning to the people on the slabs who all looked very down on their luck

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:08.300
These fine individuals have dedicated their lives to the survival of humanity

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:14.560
Clark questioned their willingness and Leon argued that things around here were much better than they used to be

01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.060
Anyway, Clark needed to get going

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:22.260
the timer had already started and Leon said he'd hate for the 24 hours to pass as

01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:29.020
They'd hate to lose Clark so soon as he walked Clark out of the room the woman said goodbye to Leon

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:33.660
Clark turned back and and looked he recognized this woman

01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:38.240
She was cold and vacant with a big smile on her face

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:43.180
her asymmetrical hair was covering one of her eyes and

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:49.020
Love the woman who killed Clark's parents smiled and calmly said

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:56.860
Bye Clark as he rushed toward her officer bishop felt another warm pinch in his neck and

01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:01.220
Love began laughing as he slowly crumbled to the ground

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.700
Clark Bishop woke up in a cab and looking behind

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.060
He saw

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:11.660
He was leaving the mill on the other side of the city

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.020
I

01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:27.940
What's up, it's Zach

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:32.740
I'm Zach here to give you an idea of what's going on and whatnot

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:40.460
so I decided it would be really helpful and nice to write a recap of season 1 so far and

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:46.180
Record it. So everyone is nice and caught up before we dive into the final arc of the story

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:51.980
I thought this would be a pretty simple task and I I thought I could encapsulate it all in in one episode

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:59.860
Boy howdy was was I super super wrong first I forgot how stupid I am

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:05.420
Second I forgot how detail oriented I can be so it's looking like this

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:11.320
Project has turned into a more work than I intended or have time for

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.280
But that's okay. I still think it'll be fun for everyone

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:21.280
Especially the players to really have a grasp on what's going down before we hit the end

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.240
So here's the deal. I I need some help

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.300
Writing this transcript. It was a massive undertaking again

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.520
Duh should have known better going in but oh well

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:39.660
So there is a link in the show notes and on Twitter and Facebook fuck Mark Zuckerberg to a Google Doc

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:45.040
We can all share it will have the transcript for this episode

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:52.880
Which covered episodes 1 through 23 now if you write up a few succinct but thorough

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:59.100
paragraphs recapping an episode of this show you will be entered to win a

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.400
PTBP t-shirt

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:06.520
Now if you write up a few succinct but thorough paragraphs

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:13.840
Recapping three or more episodes you will be entered to win one of five

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.920
PTBP t-shirts

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.160
So if only five people write up three or more episodes boom

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.760
You got a shirt and finally finally if you really if you go above and beyond if you write up a few succinct

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:31.280
But thorough paragraphs recapping five or more episodes

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:38.080
I will guarantee you a PTBP t-shirt. The clock is already ticking on the next episode

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:42.400
so let's focus first on episodes 24 to 46 and

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.320
Leave your handle or email address

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:50.580
So we know who wrote what and how to contact you in case we get to ship you a shirt this

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:58.780
This contest slash giveaway slash help Zack out project does have a deadline and that deadline is Tuesday

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.920
October 13th at midnight

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:08.860
Central time please note that the recap focused on in character action

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:15.460
There unfortunately just isn't enough time to include all the dice rolling and meta goofs in class

01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:21.680
Be wary of grammatical issues wolf the dog hates grammatical issues

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:25.380
He learned them all just so he would know how to break them

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:33.760
Now I'll get these recap episodes out as quickly as possible so we can dumpster dive into the finale of season one guys

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:40.040
I'm so fucking stoked y'all may the wolf bless each and every one of you

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.760
Oh

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.760
Oh
