00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
What's up everybody, I'm Zach, this is Pretending to be People, and Black Lives Matter.

00:05.920 --> 00:09.600
Thanks to the generosity of so many of you supporting us on Patreon,

00:09.600 --> 00:16.080
we were able to match donations this week up to $1500 in support of The Bail Project,

00:16.080 --> 00:21.040
which is a national revolving bail fund on a mission to combat mass incarceration and

00:21.040 --> 00:26.560
reshape the pretrial system in the United States. We chose this group specifically because this

00:26.560 --> 00:33.440
money will support those in our country who are protesting systemic racism and police brutality.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.960
These people are begging for justice, and we support their fight. We were absolutely

00:38.960 --> 00:46.480
elated by the response from this community. Y'all raised $1500 in just 15 hours. Incredible.

00:46.480 --> 00:53.200
As of this recording, together we have raised $3600 for The Bail Project. Let's keep this

00:53.200 --> 00:58.960
thing going. For every $5 donated, you'll receive an entry for a chance to win one

00:58.960 --> 01:05.040
of the first official PTBP shirts. There will be five winners, the first of which

01:05.040 --> 01:12.640
will be announced right now. Brendan DiPinto, congratulations, you just won

01:12.640 --> 01:18.400
a Pretending to be People shirt. Boom, four more to go. You can find the link to donate in the

01:18.400 --> 01:25.680
show notes. And while I don't think saying Black Lives Matter is a political statement,

01:25.680 --> 01:31.840
what is a political statement is this, please register to vote. The presidential election is

01:31.840 --> 01:37.680
five months away, and it is very likely that two seats on the Supreme Court will be filled by

01:37.680 --> 01:45.040
whoever wins. This is not the time for third party candidates or write-ins. If Donald Trump wins

01:45.040 --> 01:50.320
again, the Supreme Court will have a 7-2 conservative majority, which I believe will

01:50.320 --> 01:56.960
lead to inhumane restrictions on abortion, disgusting removal of LGBTQIA plus rights,

01:56.960 --> 02:02.640
absurdly loose gun control, furthering of the corporatocracy, and the continuation of the

02:02.640 --> 02:09.360
death penalty. Fuck all of that, and fuck Donald Trump. Back to you, Wolf the Dog.

02:09.440 --> 02:15.760
Top of the morning to you, pupperinos. It's your toilet diving canine, Wolf the Dog,

02:15.760 --> 02:24.080
and I'm back stroking like Michael Phelps all up in y'all's toilet water live from 694.2 PTBP.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.920
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Matt Fagel, who tweeted about the show and tagged

02:29.920 --> 02:37.440
that pretending pod. They right. I'd like to send love and support to my hometown of Minneapolis.

02:37.440 --> 02:43.360
I don't live there anymore, but I'm so fucking proud of them for standing up the way they have.

02:43.360 --> 02:49.120
My old friends, classmates, and neighbors have been taking care of each other and refusing to

02:49.120 --> 02:55.680
back down. They could now give masterclasses in crisis management to any other city in the

02:55.680 --> 03:02.960
country. It's scary times, but I'm so damn proud of them. Damn, baby Matt. I'm proud of you for

03:02.960 --> 03:09.760
sending this in the internet mail, and I'm proud of any who stand up to those who would diminish

03:09.760 --> 03:16.240
the freedoms of others. Wolf bless you, Matt, and Wolf bless you all for the work y'all are doing

03:16.240 --> 03:23.040
out there on the front lines, the back lines, and lines we don't even know about. We all fight

03:23.040 --> 03:29.440
battles in our own ways, but what's important is that we keep on battling for a better future

Pretended to Be People and write the weirdest five-star review you can muster. Speaking of

04:32.640 --> 04:40.320
mustard, it's time to catch up with the news. Last time in the fucked up puddle-filled ghost town of

04:40.320 --> 04:47.760
contention, Keith Vigna finally collected his $3 from Terrence Liquor, who was out collecting

04:47.760 --> 04:56.640
for daddy with Luca Fade Fadswigs. They had a picture of Keith Vigna in liquor's truck with

04:56.640 --> 05:03.360
a note that said, collect alive. John Lee Pettymore the third has ooze just dripping

05:03.360 --> 05:11.840
constantly out of every orifice in his head. Keith saw this, lost his shit, accidentally shot Fade in

05:11.840 --> 05:18.320
the dome and threatened John with the same if he didn't get back in the truck's waterbed.

05:18.320 --> 05:24.640
Randy Angst isn't who the boys remember him being. Randy's cane had a Rubik's Cube on the

05:24.640 --> 05:31.600
grip instead of a big tooth like Clark remembered because Randy isn't a dentist. He runs the

05:31.600 --> 05:39.600
Children's Museum of Mathematics and Randy didn't remember fighting any sort of android robot man.

05:39.600 --> 05:46.880
This baron stain on my memory has me all baron steamed up and ready for some mother

05:46.880 --> 05:53.360
creatin' father fuckin' kudzu with no backbone.

06:09.600 --> 06:27.920
Hello everyone and welcome to pretending to be people. I am Zach and I am here with Luke

06:27.920 --> 06:35.200
and Thomas and Joe. How is everyone doing this evening? Doing good, how you doing my bud? Good.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.720
You feeling all right?

06:39.360 --> 06:47.280
I got rid of it all. Our boy just revealed in a flurry of a hat pull a shaved head baby.

06:48.720 --> 06:52.560
Whoa wow so I uh yeah I was definitely on another screen.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.800
Oh it looks like something.

06:59.680 --> 07:07.680
Yeah you should go you should go maybe less on the parts that are still here.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.560
I've got a lot on the sides. You do.

07:17.360 --> 07:24.000
You've got a nice hat collection that's for sure. Hell yeah I do. It's a good shine on the top

07:24.080 --> 07:29.440
there I dig that. Yeah thank you thank you. We're getting towards the mirror you know but I want

07:29.440 --> 07:34.320
when we finally hit that Patreon level to where I get hair plugs I want people to fucking know.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.920
Yeah it's a mark of success for sure.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.680
Have you guys uh pulled the trigger on any uh things that you've been thinking

07:47.680 --> 07:52.960
about for a while during this quarantine? Yeah I did the I did a bidet I bought a bidet

07:52.960 --> 07:56.080
that's 100% the thing that I never would have done before this quarantine.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.480
I gotta tell you though I don't exactly know what it's all cracked up to be because I was

08:02.480 --> 08:08.880
brushing my teeth just fine without it. Does it help a little bit with that though? If I get my

08:08.880 --> 08:15.280
mouth right on it it helps a little. How is it so far though? Uh for real I dig it it works.

08:15.280 --> 08:21.920
Did wait so you did you get it specifically to avoid the toilet paper issue? Uh not directly

08:22.000 --> 08:26.880
but it's because like Twitter was blowing up with people talking about how much they love their

08:26.880 --> 08:32.640
bidets because they weren't in the throes of the toilet paper mayhem so I saw a bunch of feedback

08:32.640 --> 08:36.160
about how much people loved them so I thought I'd try one. Well I can't wait to try it out

08:36.160 --> 08:44.640
sometime. I don't want my own I just want to try yours. Even if I don't have to poop I'll try it.

08:45.120 --> 08:49.360
Yeah can does it work when you're standing? I can get I can get real far away from it yeah.

08:55.120 --> 09:00.240
Thomas Luke life normal. Same old shit. Well if you get a bidet yeah then you'll have something

09:00.240 --> 09:05.120
to talk about on this goddamn podcast. And you won't have the same old shit. It will be new

09:05.120 --> 09:12.000
shit yeah if I get a bidet. I'm sorry listeners that I haven't done anything uh interesting with

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
my butt this quarantine. Wait really though like you're not experimenting or anything?

09:19.120 --> 09:23.840
With like yeah home hemorrhoid remedies but nothing else. Yeah I think I have hemorrhoids

09:23.840 --> 09:30.720
I've developed hemorrhoids from sitting so much no joke. Welcome to the club I believe the

09:30.720 --> 09:37.680
Preparation H wipes are my go-to personally. You can keep yours in Taylor's purse too if you want

09:37.760 --> 09:40.720
uh it works for when you're on the go. Thanks.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.360
Tell her thank you. Hemorrhoids are dope.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.240
I've been coloring my own toilet paper.

09:54.400 --> 10:00.080
And with that let's kick into gear Clark Bishop just tackled Randy Anx through the door of his

10:00.080 --> 10:09.120
own house into the foyer of the angst home while Keith Vigna is standing over Terrence T. Licker.

10:09.120 --> 10:17.360
Terrence Elizabeth Licker who is on the ground below him. The corpse of Luca Fade Fudgevitz is

10:17.360 --> 10:25.680
leaning up against the garage door and bleeding down the driveway of the angst home while John

10:25.680 --> 10:32.480
Lee Pettymore the Thirth is in the back of the truck that is in the driveway along with his

10:33.040 --> 10:41.280
soul's cousin or his mind's cousin but his body's nephew Jimmy Sanders and I believe where we left

10:41.280 --> 10:49.200
off Keith Vigna was hollering. I was ordering John to get back in the water. Yeah and he did

10:49.200 --> 10:57.040
if I recall. Yeah and he did indeed. Oh no Mr. Sir Bishop please I don't and his head is just

10:57.040 --> 11:06.240
like slamming into the linoleum of the entryway of this old home. Oh god no I just. Clark is starting

11:06.240 --> 11:12.880
to calm down some that he has slammed this old man into the ground so hard and feeling bad about it.

11:12.880 --> 11:17.520
He starts to he starts to come to his senses and and maybe recoils and panic a little bit and kind

11:17.520 --> 11:24.320
of backs out the door leaving him on the ground. Oh no why did you came in? As the door closes

11:24.320 --> 11:27.840
behind you as you go back in. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Randy I'm sorry

11:28.480 --> 11:35.760
I'm sorry. And you exit out the door back into the front yard of Randy Yanks home where you back

11:35.760 --> 11:40.880
up into Keith Vigna. I uh my back hits you and your gun is still pointed at John right? Yeah.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.240
I look over at him is he looking normal to me?

11:46.880 --> 11:55.440
No man. I mean I mean his face is white and his hands are red from the blood that is rushed to

11:55.440 --> 12:00.960
his fingertips as he's been using his hands to jostle this old man's head into the floor.

12:02.240 --> 12:07.280
But other than that he's good to go. Yeah he's probably like crying and shit but he's fine. Okay

12:07.280 --> 12:13.040
I look back at John as he like dunks underneath the water when he comes back up what do I see?

12:13.040 --> 12:24.800
He doesn't. He's laying low for a little bit. I look at Clark. John had the ooze all coming out

12:24.800 --> 12:29.440
of him all over him coming out of him. I had to get him in the water. You just saw it just now?

12:29.440 --> 12:33.680
I just saw it. I told him to get in the water. What were you doing right before

12:33.680 --> 12:39.440
that right before you saw it happen? Uh well I kind of gesture over to

12:40.480 --> 12:45.920
Luca. Oh my oh my god. I kind of freaked out there for a second. You fucking saw him man you sawed

12:45.920 --> 12:54.400
him. You got another body T. Keith did you did you did you did you kill him did you kill him?

12:54.400 --> 13:01.600
I kind of I lost control for a second and yeah I tried to I tried to kill him and I shot at

13:01.600 --> 13:06.000
Terrence and I shot at Jimmy. Clark wants to start as he's explaining reaching out to try and

13:06.000 --> 13:12.480
pull the gun down lower to the ground so it's not pointed at anything right now. Yeah I'd let it

13:12.480 --> 13:19.440
happen. Terrence Liger is backing up like into the the house. He's like trying to get into Randy's

13:19.440 --> 13:30.480
house. Clark make sure he doesn't get away. Hey hey Terrence you stay you stay out here we don't

13:30.480 --> 13:35.520
want you going in there with Randy. He just like leans up against the door on the ground still he's

13:35.520 --> 13:42.320
like scooched backwards crab crawl and then he leans up against the front door and there's a

13:42.320 --> 13:48.400
shot where you can see in the foreground you've got Terrence Liger leaning up against the front

13:48.400 --> 13:56.880
door and in the background you've got a dead fade leaning up against the garage door. John you in

13:56.880 --> 14:02.000
there? Before any we do any of that who the you're gonna have to remind me who Fade was

14:02.640 --> 14:10.960
and Terrence Liger. It was Rocky Balboa was Fade. Hey Luca Fajovitz. Hey I'm Luca. Hey everybody

14:10.960 --> 14:17.520
calls me Fade. He's a little guy he's really wide he was a bodybuilder and he was sent to collect

14:17.520 --> 14:28.240
alongside Terrence Licker who owns Lickers Lickers Lickers and he has had beef with Keith Vigna but

14:28.240 --> 14:33.360
I think it's been solved with three dollars of that three single dollars right they were sent

14:33.360 --> 14:43.360
to collect Randy Yanks by the church by Pastor Adam Kane. Now go Joe. John you in there you can

14:43.360 --> 14:49.360
come out. John cautiously pokes his head up and and looks around this is a pickup truck right

14:49.360 --> 14:56.000
with water in the bed so he you just see his eyes like come up above the bed and he kind of scopes

14:56.000 --> 15:01.600
it out and he he ducks down you can't see his eyes anymore but you can still see um the top

15:01.600 --> 15:06.800
of his head. I got Keith to put the gun down you you can you can come up. Clark he he when I saw

15:06.800 --> 15:11.200
his eyes he didn't have he didn't have goo coming out of him anymore I think the water worked.

15:11.200 --> 15:16.160
Keith says Keith says you're all right now. Yeah okay you got the gun from him he's not gonna.

15:16.160 --> 15:21.200
I've got the gun in my hand but I'm not pointing it at you anymore. Gun is down and he seems to be

15:21.200 --> 15:26.160
uh clear-eyed and clear-headed at this point I don't I don't know. I holster my gun and walk

15:26.160 --> 15:29.920
back and put my hands up a little bit. He's holstering his gun and walking back with his

15:29.920 --> 15:35.680
hands up a little bit. Don't get that guy he's crazy man he's crazy you can't get him out of

15:35.680 --> 15:41.920
there leave him in there let's go let's bail. Go where? I don't I mean we need to get you

15:42.480 --> 15:48.720
to the F C F C that way we can save the world right like you are our prince. I don't think

15:48.720 --> 15:54.240
that's gonna be happening. Uh what's the F C F C F C the was it the first church of contention?

15:54.240 --> 15:59.440
The first kreek family is contented. First kreek right first kreek family? First kreek family

15:59.440 --> 16:03.920
contention you know we're just a big family we're trying to go back and save the world but we need

16:04.720 --> 16:10.160
we need bodies and we need peace. You guys you guys of all people should want to go buy it we

16:10.160 --> 16:15.520
we're you're out here trying to trying to save everything but we have a plan to save everything

16:15.520 --> 16:20.800
so I don't understand why you're fighting against it you can help we can save the world together.

16:20.800 --> 16:26.960
It's just your plans has not been clearly enunciated to us and uh also the fact that

16:26.960 --> 16:32.480
you need bodies and our friend is a little weird but our friend did just create a body.

16:33.040 --> 16:38.880
Yeah you can take Luca back and have that and that's our little gift to you and we'll think

16:38.880 --> 16:43.440
about giving you Keith maybe later. Well and I think we're gonna end up back at the church

16:43.440 --> 16:48.960
we're just it's not our first stop yet we got other stuff to do to help. Well you certainly

16:48.960 --> 16:54.480
didn't seem like you're helping earlier I mean are you even on the side of daddy? We don't know.

16:55.120 --> 17:02.480
I want to say yeah but yeah we don't know yet I mean yeah we are yeah we gotta go somewhere

17:02.480 --> 17:08.320
get some more fish and water to help out first. We know but we're good on fish and water. No there

17:08.320 --> 17:14.640
was a it turns out there was a leak yeah late breaking news you probably haven't heard about

17:14.640 --> 17:20.480
it since you got sent out but there was a big old leak in a bunch of the fish uh plumb dried up

17:20.480 --> 17:26.800
there they spilled into the end of the out of the out of the wall of water and into a parking lot

17:26.800 --> 17:34.720
of a grocery store uh and unfortunately there they uh they were baked uh in the in the daytime sun.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.200
Yeah so we need we need we're going we're going to take this truck full of water to go get more

17:39.200 --> 17:43.040
fish naturally look we've already got a head start you can see some fishes in there.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.480
Everybody go ahead and roll alertness for me.

17:51.440 --> 17:58.640
I pass a 42 on a 70. 20 on a 60. Alertness I got a 50 on a 60.

17:59.520 --> 18:06.400
Everyone succeeds the ground is kind of vibrating you can hear in the distance

18:08.000 --> 18:12.640
the low rumble of vehicles more than one.

18:12.640 --> 18:25.760
And it is growing increasingly louder and it is heading in your direction.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.400
Boys I what you want to get out of here. I thought I think I think we ought to you feel that.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.560
Terrence you you stay here get inside lock yourself in there don't touch

18:35.120 --> 18:38.880
anybody or anything and and don't come out till we talk to you again.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.480
You leave Randy alone in there too he doesn't want to go with you so you don't get to take

18:43.200 --> 18:46.320
order get inside and stay there lock all the doors.

18:46.320 --> 18:52.880
He listens to everything you've said and he's like yeah all right and he uh backs up he kind

18:52.880 --> 18:58.240
of opens up the door behind him you know behind his back and then he slides through it and you

18:58.240 --> 19:10.240
see him slide back on his on his butt and then he kicks the door closed and you hear uh you know

19:10.240 --> 19:16.320
how conversation sounds. Right guys I think we should hop in this get back to

19:16.320 --> 19:22.000
carry and go to the pond what do you think? I've never even seen a number two without cucumber at

19:22.000 --> 19:27.040
a time like this you couldn't fight me to not put oil on a sandwich you hear me because what

19:27.040 --> 19:31.120
I'm saying is that and I guess we'll keep we'll keep Jimmy in the back too.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.600
Just want to remind you that Jimmy Sanders is still yeah he's just he's all wet so we

19:35.600 --> 19:41.200
thought we'd just keep him back here. He's also a uh a goo detector for us if if they're using

19:41.200 --> 19:45.120
them the same way we might as well too. John are you gonna stay in the back or are you gonna come

19:45.120 --> 19:50.880
get in the cab? Uh I'm pretty wet I should probably stay back here maybe I don't want

19:50.880 --> 20:00.160
to make a mess. Okay uh Clark how's are you good at driving? Oh also if nobody is I can drive I

20:00.160 --> 20:07.440
guess. Also I'm really wet but I am the best driver. I'd say I'm just below average at driving.

20:07.440 --> 20:12.080
I tell you I'm exactly average at it. All right all right move over move over let me show you.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.960
It doesn't matter if we get the seats wet it's not our truck anyway.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.880
As Clark is walking around the back of the truck he's gonna look in the bed and see those fish

20:21.440 --> 20:28.400
and say hey I'll ride back here and jump right in. Okay boys. Hey does Clark does Clark seem to be

20:29.040 --> 20:34.160
real interested in all these fish? Yeah he's running his hands over some of them back there

20:34.160 --> 20:38.080
and kind of giggling the whole time. He's like a goddamn fish whisperer. He's actually pretty

20:38.080 --> 20:43.920
strange. Also sorry I pointed my gun at you but I saw goo coming out of your eyes and all over

20:43.920 --> 20:48.960
again I just freaked out. I don't see it anymore but I don't know what happened. Keith you ain't

20:48.960 --> 20:54.480
got to apologize for being an irresponsible thank you. I appreciate that. Just take it in stride

20:54.480 --> 21:00.720
when you're riding with Keith Vigna. I opened the like back window thing to where we can talk to

21:00.720 --> 21:05.360
Clark in the back of the truck. Clark is holding up a trout. They got trout back here man.

21:06.640 --> 21:12.240
Sweet uh well if if you're gonna be safe back there what's our next step? Should we go should

21:12.240 --> 21:17.360
we go straight to the pond or do we need to get carry? What do you think? Clark drops the fish.

21:17.920 --> 21:23.520
I mean we were headed toward the pond kind of independent of the carry thing. Wasn't the carry

21:23.840 --> 21:28.400
more of a church thing and we were gonna maybe do that later? Well we got her in the back of the

21:28.400 --> 21:33.680
car. We were I thought we were just dropping keeping her there while we went and got my watch

21:33.680 --> 21:38.320
but whatever you guys think I don't know. Yeah but then that turned into a whole thing so. Yeah should

21:38.320 --> 21:43.200
we just head to the pond and leave her be? Nobody's probably gonna find her. She's shackled up in

21:43.200 --> 21:50.240
there. Plus I'm sure this will just be a 15-minute jaunt. That's true. Let's get there. Nothing ever

21:50.320 --> 21:57.920
takes too long. No no it never it never takes days or anything so. It's almost like I warned us that

21:57.920 --> 22:03.360
this might happen but. All right I gotta go pee. Well we have the opportunity right now to change

22:03.360 --> 22:10.640
our fates. All right go pee and I'm gonna look at the map and see what makes sense. We could also

22:10.640 --> 22:15.680
not wait until he gets back and just do it so that when he gets back we're already at the pond.

22:15.680 --> 22:20.480
Yeah okay we pull up to the pond and then now we gotta wait for him to tell us what to do.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.320
Yeah there we go. We've been waiting we described a bunch of stuff that happened. Where are we at?

22:24.320 --> 22:30.080
We're at the pond now. Oh sick did you guys see all the really cool stuff on the way there? No

22:30.080 --> 22:39.200
we closed our eyes and went. We discovered a new item that lets us teleport. Whoa what was it?

22:39.200 --> 22:44.320
It was in Fade's pocket. Yeah it was the keys to the truck and the truck is a teleportation device.

22:46.640 --> 22:51.440
Also one thing that happens if you're not inside the teleportation device everything within five

22:51.440 --> 22:57.120
miles gets dies so we beat the game too. Yeah good game Zach that was cool. Yeah yeah cool

22:57.120 --> 23:02.400
thank you everyone that's been pretending to be people I guess. I hope that was the end you were

23:02.720 --> 23:04.480
looking for. Everything's resolved.

23:11.120 --> 23:15.760
Thanks bye. So press stop and I'll ask it. Yeah.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.280
Just upload it right to Google Drive. Okay. Have a good night guys. Okay.

23:32.400 --> 23:42.880
I think that we're leaning toward the idea that we're going to navigate back to our car

23:42.880 --> 23:48.480
and try and take it around to the south of the city and come up toward Bean's pond from the

23:48.480 --> 23:53.280
south. Yeah yeah that absolutely makes sense. Did you guys just do do do do we want to try and take

23:53.280 --> 23:56.960
the truck with us or do it on foot? Let's take the truck. If we take the truck are we gonna have to

23:56.960 --> 24:02.000
go by that crane barrier thing? Presumably if we're turning the car around and trying to go

24:02.000 --> 24:09.360
somewhere to head south it looks like the road just south of the hotel also leads leads west.

24:09.360 --> 24:15.760
East? Yeah east yeah so presumably it's um like go all you're wanting to avoid the barriers so

24:15.760 --> 24:20.640
we're talking about turning the car around on the highway. Okay yeah. And then driving somewhere

24:20.640 --> 24:26.960
east to get to a longer way around town. Yeah. But you weren't you asking about how to get the truck

24:26.960 --> 24:33.200
out though? Right we take it east and take it by the library. Oh gotcha. And then off the map to

24:33.200 --> 24:38.880
the side there to wherever we're going to. And then go it actually just pac-mans and you come

24:38.880 --> 24:43.120
back through on the west side. Okay then we'll. Oh cool then we just pop straight down.

24:45.440 --> 24:51.280
We'll go up until we're down. No but yeah let's do that east until we intersect with the highway

24:51.280 --> 24:59.200
go west. Okay. And at that exact moment you see that on each side of the street down on the east

24:59.200 --> 25:05.680
and west side of the street of this house heading toward your direction there is just a front half

25:05.680 --> 25:12.400
cab of a truck with a trailer on the back with a hot tub situated and strapped in onto the trailer.

25:12.400 --> 25:20.800
And then on the other side coming down is a impala and the back has been also tarped into

25:20.880 --> 25:24.560
an appropriate. You're thinking of a. No do impalas not have that? You're thinking of an

25:24.560 --> 25:28.640
El Camino? You're thinking of an El Camino. I was thinking of an El Camino. Yeah it's still cool.

25:28.640 --> 25:35.200
On the other side there is an impala coming down and it has a refrigerator that's strapped to the

25:35.200 --> 25:41.280
top of it with its door ripped off then there's someone like inside the refrigerator on top of

25:41.280 --> 25:48.000
the impala. Nice. Guys Sam and Dean Winchester are here to save us. Yeah who's who's impala and

25:48.000 --> 25:52.800
El Camino are these? Do we recognize them as the vehicles of townsfolk? No longer an El Camino.

25:52.800 --> 25:59.200
Just an impala. It's a truck with a trailer and an impala with a refrigerator. Do we recognize

25:59.200 --> 26:06.000
the impala? Weirdly enough you guys never you didn't meet a whole lot of people in contention.

26:06.800 --> 26:11.440
I mean we're from here though. I don't mean on our time in the podcast I mean in our time

26:11.440 --> 26:22.000
spending our entire lives as citizens of this small town. Yeah. Does somebody drive an impala?

26:22.000 --> 26:30.640
Uh you know the impala belongs to a very nice couple who live in the suburbs and they are

26:30.640 --> 26:37.520
members of the first church of contention and their names are Asher and Avery Little. Nice

26:37.520 --> 26:44.080
married couple who recently had two children who are twins. I mean you can try to pull at

26:44.080 --> 26:47.360
our heartstrings but it doesn't mean we're not going to start shooting the second these people

26:47.360 --> 26:55.920
pull up. There are no strings to pull at my dear sir. So are they blocking us in on this street

26:55.920 --> 27:00.640
basically? That is the attempt yes. Well boys what do you want to do? I mean these cars like

27:00.640 --> 27:05.200
these vehicles are way cooler and more capable than what we're trying to get so maybe we just

27:05.200 --> 27:11.760
take one of theirs. Take both of theirs. You want to try to get that truck then or the fridge

27:11.760 --> 27:17.200
doesn't look like it's too stable. Yeah but that's a fucking cherry impala. It's up to you you're

27:17.200 --> 27:23.920
driving you go that way and then I pull my gun out and I'll shoot. Wait wait wait what if what

27:23.920 --> 27:28.080
if you just hit reverse and we get out of here perpendicular to them both through the through

27:28.080 --> 27:33.200
the field? We could I just I kind of wouldn't it be cool to drive that big mad max truck around?

27:33.200 --> 27:36.640
I don't want to kill anybody though we've done enough of that today.

27:36.640 --> 27:43.280
That's true okay well I punch it in reverse. Okay roll drive. Reversing north and then I want to

27:43.280 --> 27:51.280
yeah spin around and head the right way. 59 we're heading back to our car. Okay sounds good you have

27:51.280 --> 27:58.320
a couple tails. Are they cutting across the field at us? Okay so as you back up through the yard and

27:58.320 --> 28:03.840
the bumps bumps and you hear jimmy sanders in the back just like oh I can't put a needle on that

28:03.840 --> 28:09.280
and like water's just like spilling out there's fish flying out you see in the rear view mirror

28:09.280 --> 28:14.800
but you you bumble on through and the truck is boom boom boom back and forth and back and forth.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.280
Clark you were just like slipping slipping from side to side in this water. Holding on for dear

28:19.280 --> 28:26.960
life yeah. And jimmy is too and the two of you are uh I can only imagine is just like the wildest

28:26.960 --> 28:33.840
wave pool the tiniest wildest wave pool of two grown ass men inside. Just fish slapping him in

28:33.840 --> 28:43.120
the face. So john puts it in reverse um guns it hard says sorry fish he's peeling he's peeling

28:43.120 --> 28:51.520
straight back does a sweet e-brake turn full like uh 180 facing the other direction peels out again

28:51.520 --> 28:57.280
leaves a bunch of disgusting tire smoke uh in everybody's faces and probably some squished fish

28:57.280 --> 29:05.120
oh and it fucking reeks uh as this uh this incredibly bad smell just gets fouled around

29:05.120 --> 29:15.440
through the the december cold air of contention and you leave a wake of rancid fish smell in your

29:15.440 --> 29:22.080
dust. And now as you hit this road you're coming up along the the road that hotel motel is on.

29:22.080 --> 29:27.840
Are you just jumping the curb straight up onto the side road or? Yeah like if it seems feasible

29:27.840 --> 29:33.440
I'm just heading straight for the highway again. Kerry pages is our only bargaining chip here.

29:33.440 --> 29:40.320
This truck is like what are you just like throwing the axle up into the air every time you

29:40.480 --> 29:47.920
hit another hill to jump another curb and go up onto the the side road and then up onto the

29:47.920 --> 29:54.320
highway. Thankfully the the metal gate broke away from a crash that happened three years ago it just

29:54.320 --> 29:59.280
doesn't exist anymore right there on the exit and so you drive right up onto the highway from the

29:59.280 --> 30:04.400
opposite side and you would be driving into oncoming traffic but you can cut across through

30:04.400 --> 30:10.480
the median the grass in between two lanes of traffic on the highway and then on to when I

30:10.480 --> 30:13.760
said you would be going in oncoming traffic you wouldn't be you'd be on the right side.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.080
I was in Britain in my head. Oh fuck off.

30:19.840 --> 30:25.920
You've never been to England? Oh yeah Thomas have you never been to England? Cheers mate.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.640
Worse I've been to Italy.

30:31.920 --> 30:38.160
Cheers mate. I could out obnoxious you in a heartbeat. Well I believe that so you

30:38.160 --> 30:45.440
cross the median of the highway. I'm confused about the logistics of the roadblock previously

30:45.440 --> 30:53.120
is it just not on this exit or is this? If you're looking at the exit of contention as a T the

30:53.120 --> 30:59.680
roadblock would be on the northeast side and you're coming at it from the southeast side and

30:59.680 --> 31:06.160
then going way more east. Once we do that we're heading back to our car. Yeah that's where we

31:06.160 --> 31:10.000
just went. Did we make it to our car? Here I'll put it to you this way John Lee Pettymore as

31:10.000 --> 31:16.720
you're driving on the highway which you would be just off of the exit leading out of contention

31:16.720 --> 31:23.040
toward the city as you're on this strip of the highway you see behind you the truck and the

31:23.040 --> 31:29.520
El Camino are in pursuit and they're following so you have the option. It's an Impala. Fuck.

31:33.520 --> 31:38.960
You have the option to head to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse or to not head to the

31:38.960 --> 31:44.720
2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse but currently you have a truck and an Impala on your tail.

31:44.720 --> 31:51.200
I head to the 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse I yell to Clark in the back be ready to grab pages.

31:51.200 --> 31:56.400
I kind of swing alongside and have him hop out and then I immediately flip him around

31:56.400 --> 32:03.200
and like start driving the truck forward and backwards menacingly near the Mitsubishi. I do

32:03.200 --> 32:07.440
that I jump out but as soon as I jump out I start going keys keys keys keys keys I need somebody to

32:07.440 --> 32:11.920
and I'm holding my hand up somebody's got to throw me the keys to the trunk. Like an Edgar Wright cut

32:11.920 --> 32:16.720
you just see the keys zoom straight into your hands from my pocket.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.520
Thomas knows how to have me not call for a check.

32:22.640 --> 32:29.440
I get the keys and I pop open the trunk. Boy I hope she's still in there. Yes.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.960
Yes.

32:34.720 --> 32:41.600
Yes. Sweet. I pulled the body of Drew out and like chuck him into the back of the truck

32:42.400 --> 32:47.680
and I get around to the side. Oh wait do we have Tyler with us? No we have him on a leash.

32:47.680 --> 32:52.400
He's in the cab. He's in the cab. Yeah we did let him right in front. And I jump back into the back

32:52.400 --> 32:58.720
of the pickup. Well here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a check. Their drive versus

32:58.720 --> 33:06.080
Clark's. Either athletics or dexterity in order to see if they can arrive in time. I'd like to

33:06.080 --> 33:10.800
aid him with my drive as I'm trying to fend them off. I like that. Yeah so you go ahead and roll

33:10.800 --> 33:19.840
the drive first. 96. So that's not gonna help uh as you're just spinning out.

33:20.080 --> 33:30.640
Oh shit dude. No. 98. Damn. I rolled a crit success. Oh boy. Of course. 44 baby. Oh boy.

33:30.640 --> 33:36.400
What happens? Where where in the sequence of events did this did the critical success occur?

33:37.520 --> 33:46.080
Exactly. So so I'm imagining that just off the highway there's a slight ditch curved down which

33:46.080 --> 33:52.480
is where the 2001 Red Mitsubishi Eclipse is and you're alongside of it and Clark hops out of the

33:52.480 --> 33:58.320
truck bed and is like keys keys keys. Toss him the keys. Edgar Wright cut. He runs over. Opens up the

33:58.320 --> 34:06.080
trunk. Edgar Wright cut. Drew is inside and as soon as you grab Drew and toss him onto the ground you

34:06.080 --> 34:13.760
see above you on the highway in front of you and behind you have pulled up this big truck. Trailer

34:13.760 --> 34:19.440
on the back. Hot tub strapped into the back and a cherry Impala with a refrigerator strapped to

34:19.440 --> 34:31.040
the top. I have to go pee again so sorry. We uh we blew up the truck and the Impala while you were

34:31.040 --> 34:37.440
gone. Sick. Oh man did everyone die? Yeah. Not us though. Yeah we were good. Oh right. We we we got

34:37.440 --> 34:41.760
a super jump ability while you were gone also so we just jumped above the explosion and then landed

34:41.760 --> 34:47.520
back down. Was there a cool object that gave you super jump ability? Yeah. Well also Tyler Gerwings

34:47.520 --> 34:51.760
and we can ride him wherever we want now. That's that's what it was I forgot. Yeah the jump thing

34:51.760 --> 34:55.840
was something we proposed but then we decided to just ride Tyler. Yeah. Right. You guys are really

34:55.840 --> 35:01.040
good at this. What else happened? Oh we all got a billion dollars. Yeah. And the and the medal of

35:01.040 --> 35:08.960
honor. Well that's pretty easy to get these days. Yeah. We got Rush Limbaugh with us now. Oh good.

35:08.960 --> 35:14.000
Rush what should we do next? As an Eagles fan and an American. Not a fan.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.880
What else happened? The whole zombie subplot we just nipped in the bud. I used to think that

35:20.880 --> 35:25.920
that phrase was nipped in the butt. Like you bite its butt. Yeah. Just bite the butt. Yeah just a

35:25.920 --> 35:34.880
little nip it in the bud. Was that was that Andy Griffith show? Yeah it was. That was pretty that

35:34.880 --> 35:42.160
was pretty solid. What's that dude's name? Don Knotts. Don Knotts that's right. What was the

35:42.160 --> 35:47.040
character's name? No I'm totally. Yeah okay fuck off because I was just gonna let it sit there.

35:47.040 --> 35:51.120
That was it Barney. Barney. I was just gonna let it sit there because I couldn't remember either.

35:51.120 --> 35:55.120
Yeah uh-huh Barney Fife. Barney Fife. Do you think Thomas is pooping?

35:55.120 --> 36:07.120
Can everyone hear me? Yeah. Yep and immediately you all hear this

36:07.120 --> 36:12.320
hooping and hollering coming from the person who's in the refrigerator on top of the Impala

36:12.320 --> 36:22.800
and coming from the hot tub you just hear this and then all of a sudden you hear glass shatter

36:22.800 --> 36:29.360
as a body comes flying out of the shotgun side of the truck and it is lifted up in the air

36:29.360 --> 36:35.760
and then slammed into the ground. Holy shit just the once? Well we're now in initiative order.

36:35.760 --> 36:40.480
Clark it is your turn you are outside of the truck bed and you are outside of the 2001

36:40.480 --> 36:45.120
Mitsubishi Eclipse and you have Drew's body with carry pages inside of it on the ground next to

36:45.120 --> 36:50.480
you what do you do? I just want to use my turn to hook Drew's body into the back of the truck.

36:50.480 --> 36:55.360
Done. Keith what are you doing? Do I recognize the person? It seems to be one of the homeless

36:55.360 --> 37:02.240
people they have got the similar vibe as the the homeless people that you were hanging out with

37:02.240 --> 37:07.760
just like BFFs with in the back of that school bus. Right can I see who's in the driver's seat

37:07.760 --> 37:14.640
of the truck and the Impala? Go ahead and roll uh search. Uh fail. Okay well I already told you

37:14.640 --> 37:21.040
you can't see who's driving the truck but you do know that the Impala is the little vehicle and

37:21.040 --> 37:27.760
yeah you know you can kind of tell that it's their outlines. Shit I don't know what to do um. Okay

37:27.760 --> 37:34.000
Thomas what are you John Lee Pettymore doing? John Lee Pettymore is just like slamming his hand

37:34.000 --> 37:40.560
on the side of the truck yelling at Clark to load up and hop in. Very cool uh you guys actually if

37:40.560 --> 37:46.560
you're looking around you can see the driver of the truck like climbs out of the window

37:46.560 --> 37:54.000
and jumps up into the hot tub in the back. As the driver of the truck is climbing out the window

37:54.000 --> 38:00.880
of the cab trying to climb back onto the trailer and get into the hot tub you see he jumps for the

38:00.880 --> 38:07.760
hot tub and right before he lands in the water his body is lifted above the hot tub. I need everyone

38:07.760 --> 38:18.240
to roll sanity. Oh no. I fail. I fail over my power I think. Let me check. I crit fail but

38:18.240 --> 38:28.400
under my power. Motherfucker. Yeah I failed 61 on a 60. I'm at a 55 on a 13. My power is 60.

38:28.400 --> 38:35.680
Yeah I rolled over my power 80 on a 13. You can't see the ooze right now? Previous to losing the

38:35.680 --> 38:42.560
sanity you only saw the body moving and you don't know where the ooze is? Lose one sanity.

38:43.680 --> 38:49.920
You see this guy as he's jumping you see him catch and nothing seems to catch him but he's just like

38:49.920 --> 38:57.200
hanging in mid-air and then you see it. You see the ooze that's holding him up in the air and it

38:57.200 --> 39:08.320
is a wave and it is the most it is the thickest it is the largest amount the quantity the volume

39:08.320 --> 39:14.480
is clearly growing this is the most you've seen in one area and it is holding this guy up in the air

39:14.480 --> 39:22.880
as the same mass is slamming the person who is sitting shotgun into the ground as they are folding

39:22.880 --> 39:30.800
into this oily substance and the person who is hanging above the hot tub they reach out and

39:30.800 --> 39:37.920
they're trying to grab onto the the man who is inside the hot tub and they're they're pulling

39:37.920 --> 39:43.760
and they're pulling and they're pulling and then you see the ooze just consumes the person who is

39:43.760 --> 39:49.680
hanging in the air and grabs onto the person who is in the hot tub as well lifts them up out of

39:49.680 --> 39:55.840
the water and the two who are holding on to each other are then being thwacked thwack thwack kind

39:55.840 --> 40:04.400
of like uh what the hulk did to loki yeah that classic gif from the marvel talkies spreading

40:04.400 --> 40:14.720
everywhere and with that the impala begins backing up clark bishop what are you doing i am now

40:14.720 --> 40:19.360
joining drew and jimmy sanders in the back of the truck done keith vigna what are you doing

40:19.360 --> 40:25.840
i'm trying i see that and i try to crawl out the window that's in the back like between the

40:25.840 --> 40:32.640
cab and the bed of the truck and i get like my top half of my body out but my big pants get caught

40:32.640 --> 40:39.440
so i'm like halfway in and halfway out and i'm grabbing jimmy and trying to hold him underwater

40:39.440 --> 40:44.160
while i'm yelling like why are you doing this why are you doing this if he's holding jimmy

40:44.160 --> 40:49.520
under the water and i'm back there can like part of my turn be to try and help jimmy not die under

40:49.520 --> 40:53.600
the water like i'm trying to get keith off of him but maybe also help keith through the window or

40:53.600 --> 40:59.440
something i don't know maybe next turn uh john lee pettymore what are you doing john is is freaking

40:59.440 --> 41:05.040
out it's like he's woken up from a bad dream and he sees all of this uh playing out in front of them

41:05.040 --> 41:11.680
he sees the wave coming towards them and even though being in this body makes his brain want

41:11.680 --> 41:19.200
to vomit he still he recognizes that he's behind the wheel of a vehicle and that like shit is

41:19.200 --> 41:27.760
coming and he just like the one thing that he can get through from his brain to his body is is brush

41:28.320 --> 41:35.680
yeah he just fucking pedal on the floor peels straight away from the wave in the rear view

41:35.680 --> 41:43.440
mirror you just hear bloodcurdling screams and the smell of like that nasty fishy smell just

41:43.440 --> 41:49.600
barely kind of tinged behind you as you see the camera is just reversing reversing reversing

41:49.600 --> 41:58.640
and then all of a sudden you cut through tree line and you are face to face with this crane that has

41:58.640 --> 42:04.720
all these tubes on the end of its payload there and it's ready to lift them up off the ground

42:05.280 --> 42:10.000
and there's actually no one there

42:12.320 --> 42:17.840
and looking around you see no one maybe they got good if i look behind us do i see is the goo

42:18.640 --> 42:23.440
a still there or be giving chase have we driven so far that we're it's it would it would normally

42:23.440 --> 42:27.600
be out of sight at this point i don't know what do i see when i look behind me you see the goo

42:27.600 --> 42:33.920
is just like racing it's like almost like hands that are inside of it are dragging it across and

42:33.920 --> 42:39.040
along the back there's a wave that's coming along the back end and crashing down that's causing more

42:39.040 --> 42:43.520
hands that seem to be crawling toward you and then another wave comes around the back and crashes

42:43.520 --> 42:48.880
forward and it's just moving slowly but way quicker than you've ever seen it move before

42:48.880 --> 42:57.040
so we're rocking seven miles an hour right now but it is steadily just if it had a noise it would be

42:57.280 --> 43:05.120
i like the idea of hand waves uh coming out of goo that's really gross and fucked up so cool

43:05.120 --> 43:12.080
thanks time man i'm still halfway out the window trying to drown jimmy oh yeah that's fun clark

43:12.080 --> 43:19.760
what are you doing to try to help jimmy sanders survive uh i just want to try and wrench keith's

43:19.760 --> 43:25.200
hands off of him and that's my only goal is to make sure that if jimmy wants to come up he can

43:25.200 --> 43:32.560
yeah and i'm fighting back against it roll them roll them dice against each other the highest one

43:32.560 --> 43:37.840
did not go over wins would i do strength or unarmed combat you can do either one

43:39.840 --> 43:47.760
i got a 54 out of 65 on strength i did a 61 on a 70 for unarmed combat nice voice good

43:47.760 --> 43:58.480
uh yeah i pry your hands off of him number four oil if i have any any momentum left in my turn i'm

43:58.480 --> 44:02.400
maybe trying to calm keith down get a hold of yourself get a hold of yourself if you want to

44:02.400 --> 44:06.480
come back in here come back in here but get a hold he's he's trying to he's trying to kill us with

44:06.480 --> 44:11.040
the with the goo it's he's not doing anything keith look at him he's he's scared him he is

44:11.040 --> 44:15.600
scared too he's he almost got drowned just now and i i look at jimmy and look at clark and then

44:15.600 --> 44:22.240
you know stare at the goo coming towards us and i like oh my oh fuck we got we got to get out of

44:22.240 --> 44:29.680
here and you feel two dog paws on your butt cheeks just boop and you right head first into the water

44:29.680 --> 44:39.840
in the back so after i push him through um i i say uh keith we've all wanted to strangle jimmy god

44:39.840 --> 44:46.000
damn it but now's not the time now look down there ain't that a beansco crane think you could

44:46.000 --> 44:52.080
operator well i used to have a toy one of these when i was a kid so yeah you're you're our only

44:52.080 --> 45:00.800
hope hey luke what is keith vigna's heavy machinery skill oh my heavy machinery is ten percent

45:00.800 --> 45:04.640
tight

45:08.240 --> 45:13.200
how far away from the crane are we coming up fast but john lee pettymore the successful drive check

45:13.200 --> 45:20.000
could easily maneuver around out of the way of these tubes and continue on the path oh well

45:20.560 --> 45:26.800
why don't i just try driving through first i guess but you got me pretty excited to use that crane

45:26.880 --> 45:30.320
i know maybe later if we have time let me just see if i can't

45:30.320 --> 45:33.520
move on okay let's give it a shot we gotta act quick

45:38.640 --> 45:40.560
yes did you do it yes

45:45.840 --> 45:50.720
as you whip and you try to pull the e-brake and be really fucking cool you're in a truck

45:50.720 --> 45:55.200
you've never driven before and you catch an edge on one of the tires because it's too

45:55.200 --> 46:01.680
bald and old and you hit a rock or some shit and you flip this mother and as soon as the truck

46:01.680 --> 46:07.840
flips everyone in the back just flies out and i need everyone to roll constitution in order to

46:07.840 --> 46:14.160
avoid taking damage for this car crash including pass john lee pettymore so i have that i have a

46:14.160 --> 46:18.800
thing that makes it so that i basically can't lose a con but i went ahead and rolled and i got a 69

46:18.800 --> 46:26.640
so i technically could succeed i got a 33 no you oh my god i cannot wait to describe this

46:28.160 --> 46:30.800
hell yeah man success

46:33.040 --> 46:40.080
fuck yeah freeze frame the truck is perpendicular to the ground the driver's side only about six

46:40.080 --> 46:46.640
inches from the crunchy december grass and the water and fish filled truck bed is erupting

46:46.640 --> 46:56.240
sideways yeeting keith out at the speed of john's insane out of body recklessness heavy on the wreck

46:56.240 --> 47:02.960
but with a success keith lands right on top of jimmy sanders who gets squished into the now

47:02.960 --> 47:10.000
wet and fish covered ground john's critical allows him to grab a hold of tyler and tuck and roll

47:10.000 --> 47:17.040
smoothly out of the driver's side window and as the truck rolls we see john and tyler huddled

47:17.040 --> 47:26.000
together somehow unscathed by this chaos field machine but most importantly with a 69 clark

47:26.000 --> 47:33.760
leaps out of the truck bed allowing it to roll underneath him as clark's legs begin churning at

47:33.760 --> 47:41.120
the speed of the crash he lands mid sprint and continues to chase the tumbling truck as it rolls

47:41.120 --> 47:50.080
wildly into the exit for contention's intersection directly toward there's a big sign what would the

47:50.080 --> 47:55.760
sign be for there's a big sign that says owls tires and tigers i'm gonna suggest

47:58.160 --> 48:03.280
and it's got a big arrow pointing to the right to the north and it says like one mile

48:03.360 --> 48:10.960
on your left keith vigna john lee pettymore jimmy sanders are all just like on the ground

48:10.960 --> 48:19.360
andrew carrey oh andrew carrey oh shit uh i'm gonna roll for drew carrey yeah roll for drew carrey

48:23.840 --> 48:28.880
i can't read it 77 77 ooh what does that mean

48:29.120 --> 48:36.160
okay we're good drew carrey takes a fair amount of damage but not enough

48:36.160 --> 48:44.640
it's uh five hit points of damage as drew carrey oh let's see constitution check to stay conscious

48:44.640 --> 48:55.680
passes fails shit so drew carrey unconscious on the ground laying in a just a wet puddle with uh

48:56.000 --> 49:02.400
with fish just flapping around on the ground and keith vigna and jimmy sanders are also in this

49:02.400 --> 49:09.680
wet mess john lee pettymore and tyler are huddled with each other on the ground having just rolled

49:09.680 --> 49:16.800
out of this insanely dangerous situation and clark bishop is standing just watching this truck

49:17.520 --> 49:25.360
just erupt into flames in this intersection as it destroys a sign for owls tires and tigers

49:25.920 --> 49:31.200
i guess we don't really need to move the crane now i need an alertness check from everyone

49:35.040 --> 49:42.640
fail eight pass i pass a 15 on a 70 zach just rubbed his head for good luck

49:42.640 --> 49:45.360
yeah put the fucking hat back on american history x

49:56.320 --> 50:02.720
oh zackie poo that hurt so you uh

50:06.800 --> 50:10.080
you should have left more or taken more i don't know

50:12.320 --> 50:18.320
you gotta go full lex luther or your dad both of whom are hot bald dudes just to the right of the

50:18.880 --> 50:24.320
sign that is just exploded up into truck flames because that's what happens when

50:24.320 --> 50:29.280
vehicles roll they all explode every time right not a chance that they wouldn't for sure to the

50:29.280 --> 50:37.200
right of that you see that there is a storm drain that leads down into the sewers and there are arms

50:37.200 --> 50:43.600
that are crawling out of the storm drain and you see a very brightly colored shirt and a man pokes

50:43.600 --> 50:54.880
his head up out oh my god gary gary y'all need to come with me right now

51:13.600 --> 51:20.880
oh

51:43.600 --> 51:54.880
oh
