00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Happy holy days, my friends and my families.

00:05.320 --> 00:10.320
Me, Wolf the dog, and my dog, Wolf the dog,

00:10.480 --> 00:15.480
are wishing you a happy one live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:16.840 --> 00:20.220
the holiest and jolliest station

00:20.220 --> 00:22.880
this side of the northern pole.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.380
My producer also sends his eternal love

00:26.380 --> 00:30.340
through a mix of wild vibrations and chatterings.

00:30.340 --> 00:31.980
What a fun dude.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.060
And speaking of fun dudes,

00:34.060 --> 00:36.400
this year howling with Wolf is from Curtis

00:36.400 --> 00:40.220
and his friend Jared, both in St. Louis.

00:40.220 --> 00:44.080
Curtis tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod,

00:44.080 --> 00:47.380
the merriest and most cheerful act of giving

00:47.380 --> 00:50.300
outside of ripping a hole in the corner

00:50.300 --> 00:52.540
of a grease-filled diner dumpster

00:52.540 --> 00:55.940
and squeezing that big old nasty metal box

00:55.940 --> 00:59.880
like a piping bag until the sludge slips and slides

00:59.880 --> 01:03.540
right into Wolf's gaping inscrutable maw.

01:03.540 --> 01:06.200
Mm, baby.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.980
But the tweet thing is pretty good too.

01:08.980 --> 01:12.920
Curtis writes, hello Wolf, master of grease,

01:12.920 --> 01:15.860
time travel, trash, and dumpster grease.

01:15.860 --> 01:19.840
First off, thank you for all the new songs you always bring

01:19.840 --> 01:22.540
and for continuing to keep us up to date

01:22.540 --> 01:26.140
on the continual and confusing adventures

01:26.140 --> 01:29.740
of the Contention PD and City News crew.

01:29.740 --> 01:32.820
My friend who's listened to all the episodes

01:32.820 --> 01:36.300
made sure to ask you not to spoil anything for me

01:36.300 --> 01:38.220
like the Christmas episodes,

01:38.220 --> 01:41.900
the fate of Jack Russell's soft, velvety eye bags,

01:41.900 --> 01:45.820
or the Contention Creek Critter Coalition, or the turtle.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.220
Stay frosty and fuck the zuck.

01:48.220 --> 01:51.620
Well, damn, thanks, Curtis.

01:51.620 --> 01:53.580
I appreciate that you acknowledge

01:53.580 --> 01:57.600
that I am the master of both grease and dumpster grease,

01:57.600 --> 02:00.020
two different food groups that I use

02:00.020 --> 02:02.660
for very different reasons.

02:02.660 --> 02:05.580
And Curtis, stay greasy.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.740
Now, if you wanna write up something

02:07.740 --> 02:11.140
for your jolly wolf to how, it's real simple.

02:11.140 --> 02:13.620
Post about pretending to be people on the internet

02:13.620 --> 02:17.700
and tag at PretendingPod, or write up a five-star review

02:17.700 --> 02:20.340
in the podcast app of your choice.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.100
Screenshot that stunning work of art

02:24.100 --> 02:27.180
and get that proof in front of my eyeballs

02:27.180 --> 02:30.760
so that I may provide you with your just rewards.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.300
Your reward of putting words in wolf's mouth

02:33.300 --> 02:36.380
is just a few taps of the fingers away.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.580
Those taps go on links, and the links,

02:39.580 --> 02:43.260
the links are in the show notes.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.660
Quick reminder, we're taking new

02:45.660 --> 02:48.420
and upgrading Patreon subscriptions.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.380
We're matching them and we're donating the total

02:51.380 --> 02:53.820
to a crisis cold weather shelter

02:53.820 --> 02:58.580
in the PTBP Boys' hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

02:58.580 --> 03:01.580
Join the Patreon and you'll get fun rewards

03:01.580 --> 03:06.260
like exclusive merch, access to behind-the-scenes live video

03:06.260 --> 03:10.140
of the Patreon recording sessions in the Den of Sin,

03:10.140 --> 03:14.380
the ability to submit an NPC and location

03:14.380 --> 03:15.980
to be used in the show,

03:15.980 --> 03:20.980
and a confidential audio feed with 38 bonus episodes.

03:21.260 --> 03:24.460
Coming later this month, the first episode

03:24.460 --> 03:27.560
of Thomas' Oops All Petty Mores arc.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.620
You're gonna wanna hear the boys

03:29.620 --> 03:32.580
make their way back to contention.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.620
And since we're raising money this month

03:34.620 --> 03:36.380
to help folks stay warm,

03:36.380 --> 03:38.980
we're combining this thing with a raffle.

03:38.980 --> 03:42.500
Every five bucks subbed or upped on Patreon

03:42.500 --> 03:44.800
gets you an entry to the raffle.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.160
At the end of December,

03:46.160 --> 03:48.800
we'll randomly select three winners.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.000
The first two will receive a PTBP shirt

03:52.000 --> 03:54.760
with the design of their choice from the merch store

03:54.760 --> 03:57.200
or the Patreon exclusive options,

03:57.200 --> 04:01.120
including the new season two Patreon exclusive designs

04:01.120 --> 04:03.440
that will be announced at the end of this month.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.160
And that third winner of the raffle can also have a shirt.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.920
Oh, and they will be invited to play in a one-shot homebrew

04:10.920 --> 04:12.760
written and run by Zach,

04:12.760 --> 04:17.080
alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas as their fellow players.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.880
So if you want to maybe get a shirt

04:19.880 --> 04:23.080
or play at the PTBP virtual table,

04:23.080 --> 04:25.560
join up before December is over.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.720
Time's running out, baby.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.660
But I am not running out of time,

04:30.660 --> 04:34.300
for time is merely a tool at my disposal.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.520
Mm, I love two things in this here world.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.960
A good bout of disposing.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.960
And the news.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.760
Last time, our assumed heroes showed

04:45.760 --> 04:49.180
some actually unbelievable footage to their editor,

04:49.180 --> 04:52.000
Vivica, perhaps breaking her mind.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.080
And then Kurt, the red-eye siren chaser,

04:55.080 --> 04:57.100
showed up with some wild footage

04:57.100 --> 04:59.560
of a new weather phenomenon.

04:59.560 --> 05:02.160
Absolutely exhausted and spent,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.480
Julius Summers headed to the hospital

05:04.480 --> 05:07.680
while Beck and Cal made their way back to Cal's

05:07.680 --> 05:11.600
to check on Stevie and Greg Fox god-goddle.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.360
But they found neither of the god-goddle's siblings,

05:14.360 --> 05:17.600
and the bindings that tied down the wet god-goddle

05:17.600 --> 05:19.720
had been cut by scissors.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.960
Beck Wilder and Cal Colorado sped on empty tanks

05:23.960 --> 05:27.160
to Bean's Bridge to assess the scene after that

05:27.160 --> 05:30.240
seemingly god-caused freak weather incident

05:30.240 --> 05:31.640
from Kurt's footage.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.440
Too tired to succeed, but too driven to hit the brakes,

05:35.480 --> 05:38.600
Cal maneuvered past the police barricades

05:38.600 --> 05:40.760
and taken us now to a better view

05:40.760 --> 05:45.680
of Bean's Bridge's new, unnaturally smooth hole.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.840
It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great,

05:48.840 --> 05:50.840
and it's all mine, all.

05:50.840 --> 05:51.720
Oh.

06:20.840 --> 06:21.680
Oh.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.520
What is that?

06:28.520 --> 06:29.340
The noise.

06:29.340 --> 06:30.180
Yeah.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.280
That's part of why I was making that face,

06:32.280 --> 06:33.360
because I was like, if there's a noise,

06:33.360 --> 06:34.960
just say it so we don't have to do this.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.800
But what is it?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800
The timer for the lights.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.000
Oh.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.960
It's just that it's not a digital one,

06:40.960 --> 06:42.880
it's just literally this mechanical thing

06:42.880 --> 06:47.480
that's just like, so I can absolutely just unplug that.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.320
I didn't notice it, and I bet you it's the kind of thing

06:50.760 --> 06:52.640
that the 30 seconds of silence would cancel out.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.680
It will cancel out.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.600
Sorry, what did you say?

06:54.600 --> 06:57.200
I couldn't hear it over the enormously loud clicking

06:57.200 --> 06:58.040
in my ears.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.840
It's episode 19 of Pretending to be People.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.880
Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham,

07:08.880 --> 07:13.300
wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, season two.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.640
Season two.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.080
Episode 19.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.920
Episode 19.

07:18.080 --> 07:18.920
Whoa.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.560
Episode 19.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.400
COVID-19.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.200
You know what that reminds me of?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.840
19, nine one, nine 11.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.000
Welcome to the numerology episode

07:35.000 --> 07:37.200
of Presenting to be People.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.440
I crashed my Scion TC at 100 miles an hour.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.880
I crashed my Scion TC.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.040
I don't care, it's numbers.

07:46.480 --> 07:51.480
So Taylor and I were at Ramatai eating lunch the other day

07:51.520 --> 07:56.520
and we went inside and there was the loudest conversation

07:56.640 --> 07:58.480
happening right behind us.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.320
We were the only two groups of people eating

08:01.320 --> 08:03.760
in this tiny living room converted

08:03.760 --> 08:06.240
into a restaurant dining room.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.800
And this loud, loud conversation,

08:08.800 --> 08:12.960
the first sentence that I heard was one young gentleman

08:12.960 --> 08:15.880
college age asked the other young gentleman college age,

08:16.600 --> 08:18.360
what is it about your actions and behavior

08:18.360 --> 08:20.580
make you think you're not an incel?

08:22.400 --> 08:23.800
Oh damn, so it's-

08:23.800 --> 08:24.800
Incelvention?

08:24.800 --> 08:27.400
Yes, it was an incelvention.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.220
Incelvention are just like bullying

08:29.220 --> 08:31.860
and it's the same dynamic as the guys

08:31.860 --> 08:33.480
in White Lotus season two.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.480
They're just still in college.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.320
Yes, it's essentially that,

08:37.320 --> 08:41.280
well, and after the whole thing went down.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.880
The fish, but the one guy wouldn't let the other one have it.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.120
At one point in time, he's like,

08:46.120 --> 08:48.160
you're obsessed with women.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.640
And the guy was like, I'm not obsessed with women,

08:50.640 --> 08:52.400
I'm obsessed with beauty.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.340
And then he's like, don't you think it's not okay

08:57.340 --> 09:00.480
to say things to girls that make them uncomfortable?

09:00.480 --> 09:05.480
And his response to that was, I say things that move me.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.480
They also don't like your skin suits that you wear.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.880
At one point in time, I thought the conversation

09:11.880 --> 09:13.920
was sort of veering into a like,

09:14.080 --> 09:16.600
oh, he actually said, do you understand

09:16.600 --> 09:18.520
that this is serial killer behavior?

09:18.520 --> 09:19.360
What?

09:19.360 --> 09:22.240
He was like, you're messaging these girls repeatedly,

09:22.240 --> 09:24.920
they're not responding to you in their DMs

09:24.920 --> 09:27.320
and you continue to message them.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.020
And he's like, I don't send them questions,

09:30.020 --> 09:31.360
I send them things.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.400
You don't have to respond to things.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.240
Oh no.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.320
No, this is not good.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.920
He's like, when people send me things,

09:37.920 --> 09:40.320
I don't always respond to them.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.560
It's pretty cool.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.160
They were peers, they were the same age.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.240
They seemed to be the same age, yeah.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.780
Much older women in nursing homes.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.240
Okay, they don't respond because some of them

09:53.240 --> 09:56.240
are physically incapable of moving their thumbs.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.120
I was wondering if it was maybe like a dad

09:58.120 --> 09:59.160
having a talk with his son.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.480
Oh no, that would have felt more appropriate.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.080
I was on the side of the antagonist.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.120
I really thought you were about to say the incel.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.920
I was on the side of the incel.

10:08.920 --> 10:13.680
I too am obsessed with beauty, sir.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.400
You should see my campaigns, they're quite beautiful

10:18.400 --> 10:19.600
if dark.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.560
The aggressor was like,

10:25.560 --> 10:29.080
what would Jesus think of your behavior?

10:29.080 --> 10:29.920
Yeah, the guy who was like-

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
Is that what it's called in an intervention?

10:33.880 --> 10:34.880
It will be in mine.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.520
And if all of you were aggressors,

10:39.520 --> 10:41.060
we'd get out of my house.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.800
It's offensive defense.

10:45.800 --> 10:50.040
Oh no, I'm feeling really suppressed right now.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.800
Y'all are some suppressive people,

10:51.800 --> 10:56.760
and me and the drugs are gonna stay right here.

10:56.760 --> 11:00.200
So it did end eventually with,

11:00.200 --> 11:03.720
actually Taylor got up as we were leaving,

11:03.720 --> 11:06.520
walked over to their table and said,

11:06.520 --> 11:08.800
after we witnessed both servers

11:08.800 --> 11:10.300
coming in and out of this room,

11:10.300 --> 11:13.840
like looking over tentatively every single time,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.040
Taylor went over and was like,

11:15.040 --> 11:17.200
hey, everyone can hear your conversation,

11:17.200 --> 11:19.000
it's making everyone uncomfortable.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.840
And then everyone clapped.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.920
We raised her up in a chair, carried her out,

11:25.920 --> 11:27.240
we got to keep the chair.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.780
I went back to Ramatai a week later,

11:31.780 --> 11:33.180
because I love Ramatai.

11:33.180 --> 11:35.180
They were still having the conversation.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.100
Makes sense.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.920
Is this guy just like a series of copy pastas you read?

11:41.460 --> 11:42.300
Copy pasta.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.220
Is that how you say that?

11:43.220 --> 11:44.760
No, it's not, you say copy pasta.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.100
You could have gotten me.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.780
Yeah, you're a jiff.

11:47.780 --> 11:49.460
Yeah, I would have gotten your jiff ass.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.860
All right, fuck you, get out of the room,

11:50.860 --> 11:53.860
we're role playing, you're in the hospital.

11:53.860 --> 11:54.980
I'm still not playing yet?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.660
Yeah, I know, it sucks.

11:56.660 --> 11:57.500
We're about to play you,

11:57.500 --> 11:59.180
but first of all- For two fucking hit points?

11:59.180 --> 12:01.880
Maybe you shouldn't have gotten the shit kicked out of you.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.760
Joe and I have written up pretty extensive backstories

12:04.760 --> 12:08.620
for your critical care team that we're gonna be playing.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.540
That's what I was doing outside.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.340
I was on nurse talk to see good tips

12:13.340 --> 12:15.300
on patient health care.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.420
Well, let's get this going.

12:17.420 --> 12:20.700
Thanks for telling me it wasn't me in Ramatai.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.220
I'm glad you kept that to yourself.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.660
You're fine with Thomas knowing.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.500
I'm sad.

12:29.220 --> 12:31.100
So, did they look like peers?

12:31.100 --> 12:33.380
I'm like, well, they look about the same age.

12:33.380 --> 12:37.020
Thanks for not telling about me dressing down my dad.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.700
Okay, no lie though, I could see your dad saying,

12:44.700 --> 12:46.820
I say things that move me.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.700
He wouldn't be talking about the same kinds of things

12:50.700 --> 12:52.700
this boy was saying, but.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.000
We're standing at a hole.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.520
Standing at a hole in the middle of a bridge.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.120
So, and you'll remember from the footage

12:59.120 --> 13:03.000
that it did seem to close up in the footage that you saw.

13:03.000 --> 13:03.840
I didn't remember that from the footage.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.940
Yeah, I didn't remember that at all.

13:04.940 --> 13:06.120
It had left a giant hole

13:06.120 --> 13:08.040
and that's why the tugboat was swirling.

13:08.040 --> 13:12.000
So, the tugboat swirled down along with its barge behind it,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.400
but then after some time of the swirling,

13:14.400 --> 13:16.900
after the tugboat and barge disappeared,

13:16.900 --> 13:18.920
it's almost like it got stopped up.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.080
I thought it got equalized.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.840
I thought enough water had rushed in.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.720
Gotcha, okay.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.560
So, now the river is flowing normally,

13:25.560 --> 13:27.640
but there's still a hole in the bridge

13:27.640 --> 13:29.720
that people are very curious about.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.840
Oh, I thought that's what you meant got closed up.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.280
No, the hole in the water.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.120
Oh, okay.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.100
The hole in the bridge is still there.

13:35.100 --> 13:35.940
Yep. Gotcha.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.560
That's the hole we're looking for, man.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.400
That's the money hole.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.600
That's the money hole.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.440
Oh, boy.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.000
Did you guys follow that at home?

13:46.440 --> 13:48.800
Beck, get a good shot of this big money hole.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.760
Big money, big money, big money.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.700
I'm shooting the hole over the edge.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.060
Yeah, I haven't described it this episode.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.200
It is on the Beans Bridge,

13:58.200 --> 13:59.640
which is the nearest bridge

13:59.640 --> 14:02.620
from Cal Colorado's home through downtown.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.600
And at the end of this bridge, nearest downtown,

14:05.600 --> 14:09.240
there is a hole the size of a revolving door

14:09.240 --> 14:11.920
from a shopping mall in the middle of this bridge.

14:11.920 --> 14:15.440
And it is unnaturally smooth on the sides

14:15.440 --> 14:18.320
where the hole has been ripped through this bridge.

14:18.320 --> 14:22.560
Around this hole, there are countless city, county,

14:22.560 --> 14:26.120
federal, state employees all coming around,

14:26.120 --> 14:28.160
looking at it with their own different

14:28.160 --> 14:31.720
sort of operational awarenesses and their own skills

14:31.720 --> 14:33.760
and trying to figure out what happened here.

14:33.760 --> 14:38.480
It is clearly a multi-agency task force.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.680
Nailed it. Nice.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
I'm getting some B-roll of the sides of the hole

14:43.280 --> 14:45.120
because I think you mentioned they were smooth.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.640
You were getting some of that B-roll.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.380
And then at the end of our last episode,

14:52.380 --> 14:53.880
the end of episode 18,

14:53.880 --> 14:57.080
we saw Cal Colorado with a glint in his eye,

14:57.080 --> 15:00.040
wink at the camera, move one of the barricades,

15:00.040 --> 15:05.040
and make his way past onto the bridge and toward the hole.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.360
Follow me Beckwith.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.500
This is Cal Colorado City Action News,

15:08.500 --> 15:10.760
and we're gonna get you the real story here tonight.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.080
He B-lines it for,

15:12.080 --> 15:13.800
you said there were like people in suits?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.680
Yeah, there were people in suits.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.520
Do they?

15:16.520 --> 15:18.880
People in police officer uniforms,

15:18.880 --> 15:21.080
people in like hazmat suits,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.160
people in all sorts of different gear.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.440
Who looks to be the most in charge?

15:25.440 --> 15:30.440
Oh, there is a woman who is wearing a black suit

15:30.920 --> 15:33.920
and people seem to be walking over to her

15:33.920 --> 15:36.240
and keeping her abreast of the situation.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.300
And she's kind of like on her phone

15:38.300 --> 15:40.280
and talking to people and then pushing them off.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.320
Keeping an eye on her for now,

15:42.320 --> 15:45.200
Cal like looking into the camera, like gestures.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.040
Come here, come here, come here.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.520
And we go straight up to the hole.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.880
Get this Beck, get this.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.700
Look at this now.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.160
Show the people what we've got here.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.480
Let's go ahead and roll law.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.800
Whichever one of you has the highest law.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.660
And this is again at a negative 40.

15:58.660 --> 15:59.840
I've got 40.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.840
Oh, I've also got 40.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.680
Did you crit?

16:02.680 --> 16:03.500
No.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.040
Me neither.

16:07.040 --> 16:07.860
Nice.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.700
Immediately upon you hitting the hole,

16:10.700 --> 16:13.500
stepping up to it, a police officer walks over.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.340
Get up.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.180
It's just the Muppet, he can't hurt us.

16:18.180 --> 16:20.500
Gentlemen, what are you doing?

16:20.500 --> 16:22.460
Gentlemen, what are you up to this evening?

16:22.460 --> 16:24.660
Cal Colorado officer, city action news.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.740
And you see that line over there, about that there?

16:26.740 --> 16:27.580
Of course, of course.

16:27.580 --> 16:28.420
And he's pointing over at the barricade

16:28.420 --> 16:29.380
where you just came from.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.300
This is bigger than the line

16:30.300 --> 16:32.500
that we're showing the people what's really going on here.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.600
Get this Beck, get this.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.540
Sir, would you consent to being interviewed

16:35.540 --> 16:36.380
and telling us a little bit

16:36.380 --> 16:37.340
about what's going on here tonight?

16:37.340 --> 16:40.340
Hands behind the back or bodies behind the barrier.

16:40.820 --> 16:41.900
Okay, I understand.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.460
We start backing away towards the people who are in charge.

16:45.460 --> 16:47.940
Yes, we're heading back to the barrier, officer.

16:47.940 --> 16:48.980
I understand, I understand.

16:48.980 --> 16:49.980
Thank you very much.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.660
You are absolutely going the wrong way there.

16:52.660 --> 16:55.820
We're diagonally, our friends are over there

16:55.820 --> 16:57.700
kind of towards the other side of the barrier that way.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.620
So we are heading towards the barrier,

16:59.620 --> 17:01.460
but diagonally in this kind of direction

17:01.460 --> 17:03.100
that also sort of takes us through the center

17:03.100 --> 17:03.940
of the rest of the things over here.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.700
At this point, you're backing into the woman.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.120
Cal Colorado, city action news.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.100
I put the microphone in her face.

17:10.860 --> 17:11.940
Get this, get this, get this.

17:11.940 --> 17:13.380
She puts her hand up to the camera

17:13.380 --> 17:14.620
and she's like, no, thank you.

17:14.620 --> 17:16.840
Your laptop screen light actually makes it look

17:16.840 --> 17:18.940
like you've got a camera light in your face.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.020
Blocking it away.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.140
No, thank you.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.140
So sultry.

17:23.140 --> 17:24.460
Yes, get away from me.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.380
Cal did not say so sultry.

17:29.380 --> 17:33.540
I was like, that was my comment on your vocal choice.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.980
Well, in that case, Zach says, oh, hey, thanks.

17:37.620 --> 17:38.460
Nice.

17:38.460 --> 17:39.300
I'm playing him a little manic,

17:39.980 --> 17:41.740
like how wild would it be if.

17:41.740 --> 17:45.660
I mean, you're like, it's 4.30 in the morning

17:45.660 --> 17:47.200
and it's bad.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.100
Cal takes a huge fucking gamut

17:49.100 --> 17:51.600
and he says, Cal Colorado, city action news.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.440
Do you know me?

17:52.440 --> 17:53.260
And he winks.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.140
Yeah, roll charisma.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.820
Negative 40.

17:56.820 --> 17:57.640
That's a fail.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.820
Would have actually passed 8,385, but.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.620
I don't give a damn who you are.

18:04.620 --> 18:05.980
Back up behind the border.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.500
And the guy comes up behind you and he's like,

18:08.540 --> 18:09.380
that's right.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.200
I said, keep it moving.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.040
Okay.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.180
And it's got hands on you now.

18:12.180 --> 18:14.340
He's like, what did I just say?

18:14.340 --> 18:15.660
Can we get somebody else over here?

18:15.660 --> 18:17.980
Hands behind her back or behind the barrier.

18:17.980 --> 18:18.820
We got it.

18:18.820 --> 18:19.660
We got it.

18:19.660 --> 18:20.480
Cal failed your role.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.320
Get the fuck out of here.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.160
Yeah, I understand.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.000
I understand.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.940
Did the woman with the sultry voice

18:24.940 --> 18:26.580
have any kind of identification on her?

18:26.580 --> 18:29.220
Whether it's a name badge or something on her jacket.

18:29.220 --> 18:32.500
Also, is she age appropriate to Cal Colorado?

18:32.500 --> 18:33.340
Yes.

18:33.340 --> 18:36.060
And she says, I don't give a fuck who you are.

18:36.100 --> 18:39.580
And it's like a powerful peer of Cal Colorado's.

18:39.580 --> 18:40.860
He's a little taken.

18:40.860 --> 18:43.100
Is Beck taken too?

18:43.100 --> 18:43.940
The sequel.

18:45.180 --> 18:49.860
So you would notice that there is a tattoo on her hand,

18:49.860 --> 18:50.940
the hand that she put up.

18:50.940 --> 18:51.780
I zoom in on it.

18:51.780 --> 18:52.940
To put in front of the camera.

18:52.940 --> 18:55.700
And it is like the tail.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.060
It's like a tail that's scaly.

18:58.060 --> 19:01.180
That's running up out of her cuff.

19:01.180 --> 19:02.780
Scaly like a rat tail?

19:03.660 --> 19:04.500
No.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.320
Like a dragon tail.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.000
How close to a dragon than a rat?

19:07.000 --> 19:07.840
A dragon rat.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.440
And it just kind of creeps up out of the cuff

19:11.440 --> 19:13.240
from under her suit jacket.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.100
And I just realized she's wearing a suit.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.220
And so as you back up,

19:18.220 --> 19:20.680
what is Beck's reaction to this whole situation?

19:20.680 --> 19:21.520
Oh yeah.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.920
The whole time he's been walking through here,

19:22.920 --> 19:24.460
he's been sweating bullets.

19:24.460 --> 19:25.480
You've noticed that his eyes been

19:25.480 --> 19:26.760
kind of darting back and forth.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.520
And he's kind of been keeping his head down

19:28.520 --> 19:30.280
like strictly into the viewfinder,

19:30.280 --> 19:31.480
pointed directly at you.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.240
And then when I bumped into her,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.200
I was probably backing up and bumped into her

19:36.040 --> 19:37.680
and saw her and I probably,

19:37.680 --> 19:39.280
the camera jostled really bad.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.100
And you saw me start to turn around

19:41.100 --> 19:43.080
and walk toward the barricade like strongly.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.440
And then remember, oh shit, I've got a job.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.140
And I got, I'm pretty far away now

19:46.140 --> 19:48.440
using a zoom to get you guys in frame.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.880
As the officer approaches them,

19:49.880 --> 19:51.600
he's like, I'm sorry officer, I'm sorry.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.080
And he immediately turns away

19:53.080 --> 19:55.840
and you kind of see like a sheepish boyish grin on his face.

19:55.840 --> 20:00.840
And with the waters of the city river raging below you,

20:01.760 --> 20:06.640
the sounds of the lapping waves hitting the rocks below.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.120
The two of you kind of headed off

20:08.120 --> 20:10.960
back on the other side of the barrier.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.360
It's about 4.30 in the morning.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.040
The haze of sunlight is kind of growing off in the distance,

20:17.040 --> 20:18.640
even though it's still quite dark out.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.800
So with all of my stats, negative 40,

20:20.800 --> 20:23.580
I think Beck then is feeling that

20:23.580 --> 20:24.800
and would just look at you

20:24.800 --> 20:28.040
with just the most bloodshot and hang dog eyes.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.720
I don't know if we're gonna be able to find anybody

20:31.560 --> 20:35.000
tonight, like I'm about to just drop on the ground, man.

20:35.000 --> 20:35.840
What do you mean?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.600
Are you not, I mean, I'm so,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.640
I'm taken up in the work right now.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.460
What a day we've had.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.680
We've got to go to the foundry.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.760
We've got to have some drinks at the foundry.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.080
I'm buying.

20:45.080 --> 20:45.920
Come on.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.620
Cal, I can't do it, Cal.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.480
Well, you want to go back to your mom's sad apartment?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.160
I was gonna ask if I could crash at your place,

20:52.160 --> 20:53.520
but it sounds like you're still going out.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.760
So I'll just sleep in the van

20:54.760 --> 20:56.080
and I'll meet you in the morning.

20:56.080 --> 20:56.920
I'll be right in front.

20:56.920 --> 20:57.740
Okay, no, no, no.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.080
We'll go have drinks at my place.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.200
We'll have some drinks at my place.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.280
Come on, let's go back to my place.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.800
Yeah, yeah, we'll go back to your place and then.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.160
It's just like hanging out with Thomas.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.000
Go to sleep.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.680
Hey, I was trying to explore that subtly

21:12.680 --> 21:14.120
through character work.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.920
I was trying to exaggerate it, but I guess, I don't know.

21:18.920 --> 21:19.760
I liked it.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.100
If it was me, I'm ready to go to the foundry.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.040
I know, but other people aren't.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.200
Something I've learned

21:29.200 --> 21:31.000
and I'm trying to express through my character,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.080
Cal, Colorado, who hasn't learned it.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.600
What are you guys doing after this, by the way?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.140
But yeah, I said I'm going back.

21:44.140 --> 21:45.400
Yeah, we get back there.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.480
All right, I'm just gonna crash in the van

21:47.480 --> 21:49.000
and I'll see you in the morning, man.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Beck, Beck, Beck.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.440
I insist.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.420
I've got seven bedrooms in this home.

21:53.420 --> 21:54.440
You will take one.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.120
Yeah, okay.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.000
I mean, if you're talking about sleeping, yeah.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.400
I am, and Stevie's gonna come back.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.320
I mean, well, you know, we're gonna probably,

22:02.320 --> 22:04.680
I've got some pretty nice whiskey.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.080
Hey, do you, speaking of her coming back,

22:07.080 --> 22:08.880
do you have security cameras?

22:08.880 --> 22:11.360
Like A, could we see when they left?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.060
And B, like get a notification if they come back?

22:14.060 --> 22:16.640
I get all these notifications from the Ring app

22:16.640 --> 22:18.440
and I don't know what to do with them.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.960
I, maybe you can find something relevant in here.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.920
Let me see that, let me see that.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.940
I'm looking at the hours after we left

22:25.940 --> 22:27.680
and seeing if we get any footage of them leaving.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.760
Did you see Stevie and God come and go like seven times

22:30.760 --> 22:32.840
like they go to the fucking bodega.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.840
They are holding pizza.

22:33.840 --> 22:34.680
Yeah.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.320
Arms full of snackies.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.160
They walk away the first time, they come back,

22:41.160 --> 22:46.160
they walk away with $1,500 in their arms in cash.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.680
They come back with pizza.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.600
A little too many, like feed too many red peppers

22:51.600 --> 22:53.220
and God goes crazy.

22:54.180 --> 22:57.780
The app wasn't downloaded on Cal's phone.

22:57.780 --> 23:00.420
Like it had been long enough that he'd clicked on it,

23:00.420 --> 23:01.900
that it wasn't downloaded.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.500
So you click download on it

23:03.500 --> 23:06.900
and as it's finishing up the, oh man, you're asleep.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.460
I see Beck just like passed out on the couch with my phone

23:12.460 --> 23:14.340
and I like pluck it out of his hands,

23:14.340 --> 23:15.780
like plug it in a charger,

23:15.780 --> 23:17.980
walk off with the two glasses of whiskey

23:17.980 --> 23:19.840
I've just poured for me and Beck.

23:19.840 --> 23:23.800
I throw one down my gullet and walk upstairs to my bedroom,

23:23.800 --> 23:26.680
pass dozens of pictures of Cal's career

23:26.680 --> 23:29.100
from the seventies on to today.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.120
And he downs the second glass, brushes his teeth,

23:32.120 --> 23:34.000
gets in like some silk pajamas

23:34.000 --> 23:37.480
and slips into a pretty fucking nice bed set.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.880
This sounds lovely.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.720
I'm warm and soft.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.320
Just in case either one of you are wondering.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.380
Yeah, we know, you're a soft little bitch.

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
Now I'm hard.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.520
What was that?

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
You're broken.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
You said broken.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
You're broken.

24:07.520 --> 24:10.520
I broke and I couldn't breathe.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.520
Can that man not breathe every time he laughs?

24:12.520 --> 24:14.520
He's like a human bug.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.520
Oh my God.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.520
You had wake apnea.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.520
Oh man.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.520
Okay, cool.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.520
We dropped so many balls today, man.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.520
I was like, I can't see a way in character

24:44.520 --> 24:47.520
to get Vivica from just stop her from walking away from here.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.520
We didn't really try that hard to go find Stevie and God.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.520
I mean, like I said, mechanically and what,

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
because of mechanically what Beck would be feeling,

24:55.520 --> 24:56.520
he just wouldn't be able to.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.520
He just couldn't.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.520
I feel like we could have deployed some energy drink.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.520
Yeah, I mean, I had it coursing through my veins.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.520
I figured that had already been taken into account.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.520
Energy drink coursing through my veins.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.520
Energy drink coursing through my veins.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.520
Yeah, I think just with the day that you guys have all had

25:12.520 --> 25:14.520
hitting that 5 a.m. spot,

25:14.520 --> 25:16.520
I was just going to be like, nah.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.520
What are we at on recording time?

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
Nothing.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.520
I have not clicked record yet.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.520
Cool.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.520
I think we can really nail it in the second take

25:24.520 --> 25:26.520
and lose all that mindless bullshit.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.520
Now we're going to double down on the soft bitch stuff.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.520
Go back, go back.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.520
Find anything that really cut anybody deep.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.520
Double down.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.520
Double down.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
Double down.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
Should we bring Luke in?

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
Yeah, let's get Luke back.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
So he doesn't...

25:43.520 --> 25:44.520
Luke!

25:44.520 --> 25:45.520
We got Luke a boy.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
I'm back.

25:46.520 --> 25:47.520
They sent me outside.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.520
How was it?

25:48.520 --> 25:49.520
I watched TikTok videos.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.520
Yeah?

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
It was nice.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.520
Did you have a good time?

25:52.520 --> 25:53.520
Yeah, but I'm glad to be back.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.520
Yeah, back in the hospital.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.520
Beep.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.520
Beep.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.520
Beep.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.520
Oh, thank God he's alive and the camera zooms in

25:59.520 --> 26:02.520
and sees that Julius Summers is out cold.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.520
I'm just kidding.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.520
Do whatever you want.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.520
It's zoomed in on the monitor, the heart monitor,

26:07.520 --> 26:11.520
and it's going beep, beep, beep.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.520
Boop.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.520
And then it pans over to Julius,

26:15.520 --> 26:19.520
who has come to from his not very restful night of sleep,

26:19.520 --> 26:20.520
and he's got to pee.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.520
So he's disconnecting that shit.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.520
Okay, it's disconnected.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
That's not what happens when you have to pee.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.520
My heart stops and I have to pee.

26:26.520 --> 26:29.520
Right, it's just disconnected because he's got to go pee.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.520
Go ahead and roll a con times five for me

26:31.520 --> 26:35.520
and that'll see whether you get your natural healing

26:35.520 --> 26:40.520
of one hit point back for the eve.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.520
37 on a 50.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.520
Nice.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.520
So take one more hit point of health.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.520
And what does that bring you up to?

26:45.520 --> 26:46.520
Seven?

26:46.520 --> 26:47.520
Six.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.520
Six?

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
Lovely.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.520
Nurse comes in, puts your TV on,

26:51.520 --> 26:55.520
and you see the same thing that Kurt showed you,

26:55.520 --> 26:56.520
but it's all over the news.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.520
And there's footage from all sorts of different angles,

26:59.520 --> 27:02.520
but you do think that Kurt's footage might be the best

27:02.520 --> 27:04.520
of anything that you're seeing flash before your eyes

27:04.520 --> 27:06.520
on cable news here?

27:06.520 --> 27:07.520
Did it break on can?

27:07.520 --> 27:08.520
Hard to remember.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.520
Don't really care.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.520
How does it make you feel?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.520
Scared.

27:12.520 --> 27:13.520
But you're okay.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.520
You can handle it?

27:14.520 --> 27:15.520
This?

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
This.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.520
It's some sort of weather tornado they're saying.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.520
Tornado lightning.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.520
That's what they're saying?

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
Yeah.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
Keep believing that.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.520
I've got to pee.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.520
That's what I'm here to help with.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.520
I can handle it.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.520
I can handle it too.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.520
Julius doesn't like this nurse and then looks to see,

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
does she have a badge on?

27:34.520 --> 27:36.520
No, she doesn't work here.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.520
It's just some wild person roaming the halls.

27:39.520 --> 27:43.520
I hit the call a nurse button and then go pee real quick.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.520
And I get back in bed and wait for the nurse.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.520
When the nurse comes in, he's like, what's up?

27:47.520 --> 27:51.520
There's some lady roaming the halls trying to scare people.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.520
Did you see this?

27:52.520 --> 27:54.520
And he points up at the TV.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.520
Oh, yeah, what's going to happen next?

27:56.520 --> 27:57.520
Global warming, right?

27:57.520 --> 27:58.520
Right.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.520
So you think it's weather?

28:00.520 --> 28:02.520
Yeah, lightning tornado, is that what they're calling it?

28:02.520 --> 28:03.520
Yeah.

28:03.520 --> 28:07.520
So watch the evening news tonight, just so you know.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.520
Anyway, how am I doing here?

28:09.520 --> 28:12.520
Yeah, I mean, everything looks fine.

28:12.520 --> 28:16.520
You're going to be in pain for four to six weeks at least.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.520
You're going to want to stay on the medicine for,

28:18.520 --> 28:21.520
hopefully not too long, but you got to take it when you need it.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.520
Don't be a hero.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.520
You'll have some serious pain in the face for a while.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.520
Yeah, I know what you mean.

28:27.520 --> 28:30.520
But yeah, besides that, you should be fine.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.520
No severe broken tissue.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.520
You're going to look the same after a while.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.520
Thank you very much, and would like to be discharged, please.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.520
Do you need a wheelchair?

28:38.520 --> 28:44.520
Julius wants to send the nurse out while he gets dressed in his clothes and stuff.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.520
Sure.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.520
But he also wants to search around for any sharp objects in the room.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.520
Oh, they don't like to keep those around in hospital rooms typically.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.520
Yeah, but how good are the doctors here?

28:54.520 --> 28:56.520
Not that great apparently.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
So what are you looking for?

28:57.520 --> 29:00.520
Something to maybe try to cut part of my face off.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.520
Oh my God, dude. Fuck.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.520
Because the pee didn't take that long, but Julius staring into the mirror in the bathroom,

29:06.520 --> 29:08.520
that was like a solid 10 minutes.

29:08.520 --> 29:13.520
Roll luck 50-50.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.520
You roll under 50, you find something sharp.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.520
Although I guess it should be the other way around.

29:19.520 --> 29:20.520
I rolled under 50.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.520
Okay.

29:21.520 --> 29:27.520
Yeah, you see there is a pair of shears, a pair of scissors that is in one of the cabinet drawers.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.520
And it's the kind with the plastic grip. It's not super sharp scissors.

29:32.520 --> 29:36.520
Julius figures this is probably the best place to do this.

29:36.520 --> 29:41.520
And he's going to go in the bathroom and try to poke the scissors right at his jaw.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.520
Yeah.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
And poke them through and try to cut.

29:44.520 --> 29:47.520
He's not going to go full face, but he's going to see at least,

29:47.520 --> 29:51.520
he's pretty sure underneath is like what he's actually supposed to be.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.520
So he's just going to remove that first fake layer.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.520
How much?

29:55.520 --> 29:57.520
Like the right cheek.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.520
The whole right cheek?

29:58.520 --> 29:59.520
Yeah.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.520
Oh my God.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.520
Okay, roll grip to go through with this.

30:02.520 --> 30:06.520
I guess he doesn't have to poke through. He can just start at the corner of his mouth.

30:06.520 --> 30:11.520
I'm going to make you roll grip to see if you can follow through with this. This is disgusting.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.520
21 out of 25.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.520
Oh, yeah. No, you're not going to be able to do this.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.520
Oh, because I passed.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.520
Yeah, you passed.

30:19.520 --> 30:25.520
As one half of the scissors is in my mouth and the other half is on the outside of my cheek,

30:25.520 --> 30:27.520
I'm about to cut through.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.520
Nurse walks in and says, oh.

30:29.520 --> 30:35.520
Julius kind of like snaps and like shakes his head and just lets the nurse take the scissors.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.520
And thank you. I guess I'll go.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.520
And Julius wants to just kind of like go past the nurse and try to leave the hospital.

30:42.520 --> 30:49.520
He fucking crit failed his grip check seeing you do that and just stands there, frozen,

30:49.520 --> 30:53.520
staring at the most awful, confusing thing he's seen.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.520
I mean, he just, you shininged him.

30:55.520 --> 31:02.520
He like walked past the door and saw you in there with the scissors inside of your like skin and mouth.

31:02.520 --> 31:07.520
Like you were putting butter underneath the chicken skin on fucking Thanksgiving.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.520
Is he like completely blocking the doorway?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.520
No, no, no, no. You just walk right past him.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.520
Yeah, I just kind of squeeze around him.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.520
I pat him on the back and say, thanks.

31:16.520 --> 31:17.520
And I look at his badge.

31:17.520 --> 31:18.520
Darren.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.520
Thanks, Darren. Thank you. Bye.

31:20.520 --> 31:25.520
And I'm going to start heading towards the exit of the hospital and give Cal a call.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.520
Yeah, absolutely.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.520
And we'll bring those two back.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.520
Bird, bird time.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.520
As I'm leaving the hospital, I call Cal.

31:32.520 --> 31:37.520
Yeah, let's get a little early morning pickup here from the Colorado home.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.520
Yeah, you were in for a while.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.520
You had a full rest.

31:40.520 --> 31:43.520
I was watching the noon o'clock news, right?

31:43.520 --> 31:44.520
Yeah.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.520
So we're talking noon thirty.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
Oh, God.

31:51.520 --> 31:55.520
Oh, hello. Hello. Cal, Colorado. Good afternoon.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.520
Hey, Cal, it's Julius. I just got out of the hospital.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.520
Julius Summers. How are you?

32:00.520 --> 32:04.520
Well, they discharged me from the hospital and a clean bill of health.

32:04.520 --> 32:08.520
I guess I wouldn't really go back to that hospital if I had the choice.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.520
Oh, which hospital?

32:09.520 --> 32:12.520
It was St. Luke's Children's Hospital.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.520
Well, now I've had several fine procedures at St. Luke's.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.520
The procedures they gave me were all too small.

32:20.520 --> 32:25.520
I'm sorry, I just woke up. I don't understand at all what you mean.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.520
Well, where should I go?

32:27.520 --> 32:28.520
Luke, what are your max hit points?

32:28.520 --> 32:30.520
Max is ten.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.520
Perfect. On a scale of one to ten, how would you say you feel?

32:33.520 --> 32:36.520
Oh, like twenty percent better.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.520
I'm sixty right now.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.520
Okay. Well, you know, we all had a rough night. I feel like I'm about a sixty-two.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.520
Curious. Cal and Beck, are the two of you down any hit points?

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
Oh, yeah.

32:46.520 --> 32:53.520
Okay, so you can actually roll a constitution check to regain a hit point of natural healing with overnight sleep.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.520
I don't have Cal as having lost any hit points.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
That makes sense to me.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
I did not pass my con check.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.520
Bummer.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.520
Bummer.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.520
He slept on the shitty basement couch where God was supposed to be.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.520
That's unsettling.

33:06.520 --> 33:11.520
God fucked it up in the escape, so it's all... your back is just, like, shitty this morning.

33:11.520 --> 33:15.520
Should I come over or go to work? What happened?

33:15.520 --> 33:18.520
Wow, Julius, I'm still kind of coming around here.

33:18.520 --> 33:27.520
Why don't you head over, I'll put some coffee on, and we'll all discuss our next steps around the dinner table. How does that sound?

33:27.520 --> 33:28.520
Great, I'll jog over.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.520
He's got to exercise.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.520
Yeah, that's close.

33:30.520 --> 33:33.520
Beck, what's the wake up situation?

33:33.520 --> 33:36.520
I wouldn't wake up unless you did something to wake me up.

33:36.520 --> 33:40.520
Oh, yeah, remember the intro scene to Beck Wilder.

33:40.520 --> 33:47.520
Face down, tighty whities up, that's the way he likes to sleep in.

33:47.520 --> 33:55.520
Cal doesn't do anything in particular, but he is loudly whistling, and at a few points, like, definitely running from room to room as he grabs different things,

33:55.520 --> 34:02.520
and he's kind of excited and preparing, like, yeah, we're going to have coffee and then we're going to plan our Pulitzer Day, part two.

34:02.520 --> 34:10.520
So, yeah, you would hear him running up and down stairs and stuff, and he's a big enough guy that it's booming through the house.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.520
You hear one stir from the couch.

34:12.520 --> 34:18.520
No, mom, I don't want to walk a dog. It's not my dog.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.520
Oh!

34:19.520 --> 34:27.520
You hear the, like, the basement door creak open, and Cal peeks his head and he says, Beck, Beck, good morning.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.520
Coffee's on in five. Get on up here.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.520
Get on up here.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.520
Yeah, okay, I'll be right up.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.520
We've got to find Stevie and God.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
Yeah, big day.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.520
Julius is coming over.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.520
Is he all right?

34:38.520 --> 34:40.520
Oh, uh, 60 percent?

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
All right, good enough.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
That's what I said.

34:42.520 --> 34:43.520
All right, I'll be up in a sec.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.520
Nothing some coffee can't fix.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.520
Julius opens the front door, a little sweaty.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.520
Who the fuck is that?

34:52.520 --> 34:53.520
Got any water?

34:53.520 --> 34:57.520
Oh, he's got some very well-made lattes, each with a little, like, news van in it.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.520
He's like, oh, yeah, yeah.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.520
Those are great.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.520
You can have some water.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.520
Julius takes one and then sips it and has a little milk froth mustache.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.520
I saw the news broke. I saw God on TV.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.520
Cal drops the tray.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.520
What do you mean our news broke?

35:11.520 --> 35:17.520
I turn it to can on his TV, and magically that is on.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.520
You can do magic?

35:18.520 --> 35:19.520
That story is...

35:19.520 --> 35:21.520
I turn the TV on and it's like they're interested.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.520
You turn the TV on and it's in Cal, Colorado's house, so it's on can.

35:24.520 --> 35:28.520
And can is currently covering this exclusively.

35:28.520 --> 35:33.520
They're just about to intro the whole story on can, so it's perfect timing.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.520
Becca's walking up now, up to the back of the couch, into frame.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.520
They're running. What are they running? They're running.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.520
Is it ours?

35:40.520 --> 35:43.520
It's Daddy's. Kurt's. Kurt's footage.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.520
Okay, with our pickup from last night?

35:46.520 --> 35:47.520
Would you have been able to send that in?

35:47.520 --> 35:49.520
Yeah, we sent that in, Link.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
I think you have to take it to the station.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.520
The rules of the universe, as we've established, seems like we would have to take it.

35:54.520 --> 36:01.520
I figured we'd run it as an evening news segment, but that was breaking news because people know about it.

36:01.520 --> 36:07.520
People saw it, as far as the logistics of Julius' thoughts went.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.520
When Kurt's footage ends, you see the can studio.

36:11.520 --> 36:19.520
Isabella Kaya back with this absolutely staggering story here on City Action News.

36:19.520 --> 36:25.520
I mean, for those of us watching at home who have never seen Lightning Tornado before,

36:25.520 --> 36:33.520
it can be scary, but I'm being told from those scientists who we love listening to here at can

36:33.520 --> 36:37.520
that there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.520
Isabella Kaya, City Action News.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.520
Kaya was like, didn't they see our footage?

36:42.520 --> 36:47.520
It's not a lightning tornado, it's God! That's God, you idiots!

36:47.520 --> 36:51.520
Everybody at the hospital just thought it was a lightning tornado.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.520
That's stupid!

36:53.520 --> 36:54.520
It's what they're telling him.

36:54.520 --> 36:59.520
Wait, maybe we could spin this as a positive. Now we'll be able to answer all the questions.

36:59.520 --> 37:06.520
Instinctively, Beckwilder reaches his hand in his pocket for the thumb drive that he copied all the footage onto,

37:06.520 --> 37:09.520
and he flashbacks to the moment that Vivica-

37:09.520 --> 37:11.520
Put that kick me sign on me.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.520
Put that kick me sign on you.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.520
She stole it.

37:14.520 --> 37:18.520
And you reach the bottom of your pocket and your heart sinks.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.520
Beck, what's wrong?

37:20.520 --> 37:25.520
You're right, Beck. We can just say teasers that's like the crazy tornado that happened.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.520
We'll just tune into can and we'll tell you what it's all about.

37:28.520 --> 37:29.520
Beck, what's wrong?

37:29.520 --> 37:31.520
Let's get that footage over to the station.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.520
Look at his face, Julius.

37:32.520 --> 37:37.520
Yeah, the footage, it's on the thumb drive. Remember the thumb drive?

37:37.520 --> 37:38.520
Yeah.

37:38.520 --> 37:43.520
And I put it into this pocket and that pocket is empty.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.520
Check your other pocket.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.520
Check.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.520
And I check another pocket, and I check another pocket.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.520
Your coat.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.520
And I check another pocket.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.520
Check the fucking camera, Beck. Check the can van.

37:57.520 --> 38:01.520
Yeah, Vivian took the drive. She had to have.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.520
Vivica, she had to have.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.520
When would Vivica have taken the drive?

38:04.520 --> 38:07.520
When she put that hilarious sign on his back.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.520
Oh, we've got to find Vivica.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.520
We've got to find Vivica, we've got to find Stevie, we've got to find our footage.

38:12.520 --> 38:15.520
All we have is your TikToks, Julius.

38:15.520 --> 38:19.520
Julius, like, kind of perks up and then goes to post another TikTok.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.520
I posted the Jackalope one yesterday.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.520
Yep.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
Guys, which one should I do?

38:23.520 --> 38:25.520
I don't know what you have.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.520
Didn't we have footage of the medical device, maybe? Was that something?

38:28.520 --> 38:31.520
Yeah, I'll do that, of them healing up your wound.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.520
Yeah.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.520
He posts that.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.520
Do that.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.520
And while it's doing it, he puts, like, the sound that would be in a St. Jude's commercial,

38:37.520 --> 38:41.520
he puts that in the background as the sound and uploads it.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.520
Good edit.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.520
We've got to find Vivica.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.520
We've got to find Stevie and God.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.520
We've got to find out what the fuck is going on at Cannes and where our footage is.

38:54.520 --> 38:55.520
I'm going to call Cannes.

38:55.520 --> 38:57.520
Bec, do you feel comfortable?

38:57.520 --> 38:59.520
Can you hunt down Vivica?

38:59.520 --> 39:00.520
Yeah.

39:00.520 --> 39:01.520
Do you know her?

39:01.520 --> 39:03.520
Of course. I've got to get my footage back, dude.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.520
You don't think she got rid of it, right?

39:04.520 --> 39:07.520
Julius, can you get a hold of your uncle or go to his home?

39:07.520 --> 39:08.520
I call Tyfe.

39:08.520 --> 39:09.520
Boing, boing.

39:09.520 --> 39:10.520
Boing, boing.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.520
Boing, boing.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
Boing, boing.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.520
Julius.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.520
Uncle.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.520
My guy.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.520
Uncle Tyfe.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.520
We've got good news.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
Yeah? Well, I am, like-

39:21.520 --> 39:23.520
Well, and bad news.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
Tell him we've got questions.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.520
What are you doing? Why weren't you answering my calls yesterday?

39:26.520 --> 39:29.520
I'm fucking hungry for good news.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.520
You're going to give me some good news? I love that.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.520
We've got crazy footage, but we lost it.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.520
Well, like I said, we hungry.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.520
All right, tell me about this footage.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.520
Grover's Gorge. Have you heard of it?

39:42.520 --> 39:45.520
Forget about it. Cut. What are you talking about?

39:45.520 --> 39:49.520
We followed that anonymous tip and it led us to Grover's Gorge,

39:49.520 --> 39:52.520
which is a hidden utopia that's ran by the-

39:52.520 --> 39:53.520
Dystopia.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.520
The Godel company.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.520
It's a utopia?

39:55.520 --> 39:57.520
It's run by the Godel company?

39:57.520 --> 39:58.520
That's amazing.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.520
It's nice, but it's bad.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.520
It was an anonymous tip? What was it?

40:01.520 --> 40:03.520
It was just a pin in the middle of nowhere.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.520
Just a pin? Who was assigning all the-

40:05.520 --> 40:08.520
I mean, I assume it was Isabella who assigned you all the stories?

40:08.520 --> 40:10.520
She did a bang up job. She's good.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.520
She's all right. She's the best.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.520
Well, we've got to find Vivica. Are you at work?

40:14.520 --> 40:16.520
Yeah, I'm in the office.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
Is Vivica there?

40:17.520 --> 40:18.520
I don't know. I'm upstairs.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.520
Can you check?

40:20.520 --> 40:21.520
Let me slack her real quick.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.520
Oh, it says she's working from home.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.520
Did you-

40:24.520 --> 40:27.520
I get on the slack channel and add Vivica?

40:27.520 --> 40:29.520
What's up?

40:29.520 --> 40:31.520
Oh, no buy? No buy for your uncle?

40:31.520 --> 40:34.520
I am doing that with him still on the phone.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.520
Uncle type, yeah.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.520
When I talk to Vivica, we'll bring you the footage and show it to you, but it's big.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.520
Well, if it makes the Godel company look great, that's fantastic, you know?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.520
They were really haranguing us about that last story.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.520
It got crazy there, but you know, this is going to be great.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.520
Good job, Julius.

40:49.520 --> 40:53.520
Oh, you're going to be on top so soon if you keep it up like this, my guy.

40:53.520 --> 40:54.520
Are you working all week?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.520
You're taking a vacation this week, right?

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
What?

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
I thought you told me.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.520
You're taking the week off.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.520
No, just a day.

41:00.520 --> 41:01.520
Just a day.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.520
Had a meeting down at the city, city tower.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.520
Well, you sound like you could get some rest.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.520
Whoa, is that a burn?

41:07.520 --> 41:08.520
Is that a sick burn?

41:08.520 --> 41:09.520
Did I get got?

41:09.520 --> 41:10.520
I don't know.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
I'll talk to you later.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
I've got to find Vivica.

41:12.520 --> 41:13.520
Bye.

41:13.520 --> 41:14.520
Beep.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.520
I couldn't help but hear like some of that over the receiver.

41:16.520 --> 41:19.520
Guys, we can't show my uncle the footage.

41:19.520 --> 41:24.520
He said as long as it makes the Godel company look good, then he'll be happy.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.520
We can't show it to him.

41:25.520 --> 41:27.520
We've got to find a way to run it without it going past him.

41:27.520 --> 41:30.520
He said only good news for the Godel...

41:30.520 --> 41:31.520
Fuck.

41:31.520 --> 41:32.520
He said...

41:32.520 --> 41:33.520
He threatened you?

41:33.520 --> 41:36.520
He said only good news for the Godel company.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.520
I mean, he didn't threaten me, but...

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
He threatened the truth.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.520
He threatened the news.

41:39.520 --> 41:40.520
Basically, yeah.

41:40.520 --> 41:43.520
I mean, has my uncle always been like this?

41:43.520 --> 41:44.520
Not in my experience.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.520
Julius, I haven't felt like this since 1983.

41:47.520 --> 41:48.520
What happened in 1983?

41:48.520 --> 41:53.520
That was a personal matter.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.520
But it is the closest to truth and justice I've ever truly come.

41:56.520 --> 42:02.520
And you see a flashback to Cal spending a summer following his brother around

42:02.520 --> 42:09.520
and catching him in this elaborate lie about a Christmas gift.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.520
Beck, do you know where Vivica lives?

42:12.520 --> 42:14.520
You've worked with her closely for so long.

42:14.520 --> 42:17.520
Yeah, I know the neighborhood.

42:17.520 --> 42:20.520
I dropped her off two or three times over the years.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.520
I think I could find it.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.520
Roll intelligence.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.520
Oh my God, it's a 70 on a 70.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.520
Yeah.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.520
Ooh!

42:27.520 --> 42:28.520
Our smiles.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.520
Good boy.

42:29.520 --> 42:31.520
Yeah, I know exactly.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.520
I could take you right there.

42:32.520 --> 42:33.520
Yeah.

42:33.520 --> 42:34.520
Totally, dude.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.520
I think we've got to go get this shit from Vivica.

42:36.520 --> 42:37.520
We've got to get our fucking footage.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.520
We've got to get the footage.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.520
Vivica has our Pulitzer.

42:40.520 --> 42:46.520
I didn't go through all of that shit just to get the footage stolen by some fucking

42:46.520 --> 42:47.520
editor.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.520
Vivica's good, though.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.520
Vivica's good, though.

42:51.520 --> 42:55.520
Maybe she just is doing touch-ups at home and forgot to-

42:55.520 --> 42:57.520
You saw her face yesterday, Beck.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.520
She's not just doing touch-ups.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.520
That footage is in danger.

43:00.520 --> 43:01.520
We've got to get to her, guys.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.520
Vivica taught us an important lesson, which is that this footage is more powerful than

43:05.520 --> 43:06.520
even we suspected.

43:06.520 --> 43:10.520
We know we've got something here, but we need to be a little more careful with it,

43:10.520 --> 43:12.520
and to that end, we have to secure it immediately.

43:12.520 --> 43:15.520
Guys, we've got to get this footage from Vivica.

43:15.520 --> 43:21.520
Vivica, if the news is like music, these pieces are The Beatles.

43:21.520 --> 43:22.520
That's what I've always said, dude.

43:22.520 --> 43:23.520
Yeah.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.520
The Beatles were very popular when I was a schoolboy, and-

43:26.520 --> 43:27.520
They're still popular.

43:27.520 --> 43:33.520
I just want to say I resented them at the time, but I do understand their appeal.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.520
Let's go, boys.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.520
I met them once.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.520
You can tell us about it on the way there, Cal.

43:40.520 --> 43:43.520
I figure that's what he says as we're walking out the door.

43:43.520 --> 43:44.520
Cal, you never told me.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.520
You met the fucking Beatles, dude?

43:46.520 --> 43:48.520
That's the coolest fucking shit I've ever heard.

43:48.520 --> 43:53.520
As we're walking out, Cal points to several pictures, like three pictures with the Beatles

43:53.520 --> 43:59.520
at different stages of their career when he's a kid, and then finally in their 70s crazy

43:59.520 --> 44:05.520
phase, one is him as a teenager reporter, and then multiple pictures of him with John

44:05.520 --> 44:13.520
Lennon up to a point, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and he shows you some extensive

44:13.520 --> 44:18.520
correspondence with Ringo.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.520
You got this last one in under the wire.

44:20.520 --> 44:24.520
He stopped taking mail, famously stopped taking mail recently.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.520
Not for friends.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.520
Nice.

44:28.520 --> 44:31.520
We play chess by mail.

44:31.520 --> 44:35.520
Across the pond, it takes forever.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.520
Why are we wasting time?

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
Get in the van.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.520
Get in the van.

44:40.520 --> 44:41.520
No, wait.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.520
Who else?

44:43.520 --> 44:47.520
Beck, you've never shown any interest in my pictures before now.

44:47.520 --> 44:50.520
I had never noticed that that was George Harrison there that you're sitting on the bench with.

44:50.520 --> 44:52.520
Who else haunts these halls?

44:52.520 --> 44:53.520
I'm kidding.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.520
I figured this was happening in the van.

44:55.520 --> 44:57.520
Definitely happening in the van.

44:57.520 --> 44:58.520
Is it that one?

44:58.520 --> 45:00.520
There it is right there.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.520
The van is lined with pictures too.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.520
Some of the choicer ones.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.520
Vivica has a pretty cool place above a bodega on the corner.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.520
A bodega?

45:11.520 --> 45:15.520
I thought you said bodega, which would be really fun.

45:15.520 --> 45:18.520
She lives above a place called Bodega.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.520
They sell bidets and bagels.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.520
Bodega.

45:25.520 --> 45:29.520
The sign has the water shooting through a doughnut, a bagel hole.

45:32.520 --> 45:39.520
It is also just a standard bodega with a cat, but it's also bodega.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.520
It's bodega.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.520
No, it's clearly not.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.520
Julius really wants to stop in, but knows that there's no time.

45:50.520 --> 45:53.520
Yeah, and her door is just off to the side.

45:53.520 --> 45:58.520
Beck, you would know that when you open up the door, it just immediately stares on the other side,

45:58.520 --> 46:02.520
so you'd have to buzz up, but the last time you were here, the buzzer didn't work.

46:02.520 --> 46:05.520
Now I'm just picturing your old apartment.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.520
They have to run down and meet us?

46:08.520 --> 46:09.520
Well, we hit the buzzer.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.520
It is July 6th. It's about 1pm.

46:13.520 --> 46:16.520
It's a hot day. The sun is shining down.

46:16.520 --> 46:20.520
It's a Wednesday. Less kids on the street than usual, and the ones that you do see, you're like,

46:20.520 --> 46:21.520
It's Wednesday.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.520
There's the urchins.

46:22.520 --> 46:27.520
Cal remembers, and it's weird that he and Beck didn't remember before now,

46:27.520 --> 46:31.520
but he remembers that they successfully downloaded the Ring app,

46:31.520 --> 46:33.520
and that it'll have all the footage from last night.

46:33.520 --> 46:35.520
Oh yeah.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.520
Oh yeah.

46:36.520 --> 46:41.520
Hold on, boys. Before we go in, let's take a moment to watch what came in and out of the front door last night.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.520
Of here?

46:42.520 --> 46:46.520
No, of my place. Remember how God and Stevie escaped?

46:46.520 --> 46:48.520
Yeah, you guys haven't talked about that much.

46:48.520 --> 46:53.520
Well, you know, we went to the bridge last night, and then we slept in, and it was at a chance since then.

46:53.520 --> 47:00.520
Yeah, I mean, I figured when I saw Kurt's footage that, I mean, I knew that Stevie and God weren't gonna be at your apartment anymore.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.520
So what, did you find anything?

47:01.520 --> 47:03.520
God is everywhere, Julius.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.520
Did you find anything?

47:05.520 --> 47:10.520
We found evidence that Stevie may have let Fox out of his bindings.

47:10.520 --> 47:17.520
And so we went and just, like, did a cursory check at the bridge, but we were both beat, so we didn't get much there.

47:17.520 --> 47:21.520
But then I realized that maybe Cal has security cameras, and sure enough, he does.

47:21.520 --> 47:24.520
So I downloaded the app last night, and I didn't get a chance to look at it.

47:24.520 --> 47:26.520
Let's watch it.

47:26.520 --> 47:27.520
That is a wild sound.

47:27.520 --> 47:30.520
Yeah, there's a bunch of owls going crazy outside.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.520
Is that what that is?

47:31.520 --> 47:33.520
Yeah, take your headphone out.

47:36.520 --> 47:41.520
They're like, shut up, Zach's listening now.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.520
I thought somebody's, like, phone or something.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.520
Yeah, I thought it was his phone.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.520
That was nuts.

47:46.520 --> 47:47.520
What were we doing? Oh, yeah.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.520
The app.

47:48.520 --> 47:49.520
The app, I downloaded the app.

47:49.520 --> 47:50.520
Yeah, the Ring app.

47:50.520 --> 47:52.520
Let's see what happened.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.520
For just $4.99 a month, you can subscribe to Ring.

47:54.520 --> 47:56.520
In grainy black and white.

47:56.520 --> 47:58.520
Get the premium.

47:58.520 --> 48:01.520
No, it's a Ring camera, it's not grainy black and white for sure.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.520
Oh, but it's nighttime.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.520
It's a Ring camera, which is a high quality camera.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.520
Yeah, but it's nighttime.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.520
It's the only camera I would buy to secure my house.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.520
Where can you pick one up?

48:13.520 --> 48:16.520
Amazon is where I got mine. You can get them directly from Ring.com.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.520
We're not allowed to have separate deals, you rat.

48:21.520 --> 48:23.520
So what do we see in, like, the...

48:23.520 --> 48:26.520
So hit those show notes for a link to the Ring camera.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.520
They're both in on it.

48:27.520 --> 48:28.520
Available at Target.

48:28.520 --> 48:29.520
Thank you.

48:29.520 --> 48:32.520
We see high quality black and white.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.520
Yeah, because it's nighttime.

48:33.520 --> 48:35.520
Yeah, but it's high quality, it's not grainy.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.520
Because it's Ring camera at Ring.com.

48:45.520 --> 48:49.520
While Beck is pulling up the footage, I'm ordering a bedagel.

48:50.520 --> 48:52.520
Wow, that app looks so user friendly.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.520
With just a few simple tabs, I can see who's at the front door.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.520
Let's tab away.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.520
Yes, one plain bagel please and one everything bidet.

49:02.520 --> 49:12.520
Suddenly, you see Stevie walk out the front door, followed by Greg Godle.

49:12.520 --> 49:17.520
She holds the door open as Greg passes her and heads down to the front yard.

49:17.520 --> 49:21.520
Stevie closes the door, notices the Ring camera.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.520
Oh.

49:22.520 --> 49:23.520
Everyone roll humit.

49:23.520 --> 49:26.520
I thought she was here and I was like, I don't know why she's here, but I'm excited.

49:26.520 --> 49:28.520
Oh my god, that's why you were waving?

49:29.520 --> 49:32.520
I was going to offer her a bagel.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.520
Oh my god.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.520
What am I rolling?

49:35.520 --> 49:36.520
Humid.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.520
I passed 24 on 70.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.520
I failed a 93 on a 40.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.520
Yeah, Cal fails.

49:42.520 --> 49:44.520
I also got a 93.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
Ooh, spooky.

49:45.520 --> 49:49.520
Cal's looking at all the features of his everything bidet on the box.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.520
Cover your ears real quick, Thomas and Joe.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.520
Luke, something in their face.

49:53.520 --> 49:56.520
When Stevie turns back, you see Shane.

49:57.520 --> 50:02.520
So like I can tell from the footage it doesn't look like she's doing it completely against her will.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.520
That's right.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
That's exactly right.

50:04.520 --> 50:08.520
And you two see the face of Stevie turn back.

50:08.520 --> 50:12.520
They look at the camera and they turn back away and head off into the street.

50:12.520 --> 50:17.520
The Ring camera footage is so high quality you can see the shame on Stevie's face.

50:19.520 --> 50:20.520
I'm sorry.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.520
I wasn't getting that from this footage.

50:21.520 --> 50:22.520
What did you see?

50:22.520 --> 50:23.520
Look.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.520
Rewind it.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.520
Look.

50:25.520 --> 50:26.520
She's not making her do it.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.520
She's doing it on her own but she knows.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.520
Look.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.520
She sees it right there.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.520
She sees the camera.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.520
She just looks ashamed.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.520
I think she looks gassy.

50:34.520 --> 50:36.520
I mean, could be.

50:36.520 --> 50:37.520
Shame gas.

50:37.520 --> 50:41.520
But I mean, Godel's not forcing her to do this.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.520
It is her brother after all.

50:43.520 --> 50:46.520
I mean, she was pretty forward with the idea that she was trying to help him.

50:46.520 --> 50:47.520
Maybe this isn't all bad.

50:47.520 --> 50:52.520
Maybe he talked her into this but she has a plan.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.520
She wouldn't let him jump off of something.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.520
She doesn't want her brother to die.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.520
Could she stop him?

50:58.520 --> 50:59.520
Yeah.

50:59.520 --> 51:01.520
Even if she was on the way to somewhere she thought might help.

51:01.520 --> 51:02.520
She's Trixie.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.520
She might have something up her sleeve.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.520
No, she's Stevie.

51:05.520 --> 51:06.520
Oh, shit.

51:06.520 --> 51:09.520
Trixie was kind of the burnout in turn.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.520
The one with the vape pen.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.520
I assume the buzzer.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.520
Guys, I don't think the buzzer's working here.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.520
We gotta find Vivica.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.520
We gotta find Stevie.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.520
Her window's that one.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
Hang on a sec.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.520
And I'm trying to find a pebble to throw at the window.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.520
Oh, yeah.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
There's plenty of pebbles.

51:25.520 --> 51:26.520
Tink.

51:26.520 --> 51:27.520
Vivica!

51:27.520 --> 51:29.520
Vivica, it's back!

51:29.520 --> 51:30.520
Vivica!

51:30.520 --> 51:34.520
Is the door that leads up to the stairs a wooden door or a glass door?

51:34.520 --> 51:35.520
What was it, Joe?

51:35.520 --> 51:36.520
It was a glass door.

51:36.520 --> 51:37.520
No, it wasn't.

51:37.520 --> 51:41.520
If you're talking about my old apartment, it had a glass pane that you could see through.

51:41.520 --> 51:42.520
On the outside it did.

51:42.520 --> 51:43.520
Yeah, like the downstairs one.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.520
What?

51:44.520 --> 51:45.520
How tall?

51:45.520 --> 51:46.520
You could see into the stairwell.

51:46.520 --> 51:50.520
It had lettering on the window up to my apartment you could see through.

51:50.520 --> 51:51.520
Interesting.

51:51.520 --> 51:54.520
It said, Joe Terry, private eye.

51:54.520 --> 51:55.520
Very much like that.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.520
Dangerous dames turn around.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.520
He had legs.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.520
Two of them.

51:59.520 --> 52:00.520
Guys, watch out.

52:00.520 --> 52:03.520
They were walking all over me.

52:03.520 --> 52:07.520
He could see through me like the glass door at the bottom of my apartment stairs.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.520
Joe's apartment.

52:09.520 --> 52:14.520
So yeah, you can kind of see, you can see the top of the stairs kind of through the glass,

52:14.520 --> 52:17.520
but then there's the rest of the door is composite.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.520
Guys, we gotta get in there.

52:19.520 --> 52:26.520
And he hikes up his fancy work shorts and is going to try to kick this door in down.

52:26.520 --> 52:30.520
I'm normally not a fan of property damage, but we don't know that our coworker is safe

52:30.520 --> 52:31.520
right now.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.520
Got those big powerful legs.

52:32.520 --> 52:33.520
We should use them.

52:33.520 --> 52:38.520
At the exact moment that you rear back on one of your enormous thighs, one of the...

52:38.520 --> 52:41.520
Rear back on like he rocks the floor.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.520
Yeah.

52:42.520 --> 52:47.520
Eat some fucking spinach and one of them gets like Popeye-age.

52:47.520 --> 52:53.520
One of the botanical employees walks out and goes to light a cigarette and as they're

52:53.520 --> 52:59.520
about to light up, they look over at you as your leg is like up in the air about to kick

52:59.520 --> 53:01.520
and their mouth just kind of drops.

53:01.520 --> 53:04.520
But the cigarette sticks to their lip because it was dry.

53:04.520 --> 53:15.520
Julia says, watch this and kicks.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.520
Wow.

53:16.520 --> 53:22.520
A plus 20 on strength or criminology, whichever one's higher.

53:22.520 --> 53:23.520
Strength or criminology?

53:23.520 --> 53:24.520
Yeah.

53:24.520 --> 53:25.520
Let's see.

53:25.520 --> 53:26.520
I don't think I have any criminology.

53:26.520 --> 53:27.520
Nope.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.520
Okay.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.520
Let's see.

53:29.520 --> 53:30.520
Up and down.

53:30.520 --> 53:31.520
50-50.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.520
With a plus 20 because...

53:32.520 --> 53:33.520
Okay.

53:33.520 --> 53:34.520
12 on a 70 then.

53:34.520 --> 53:35.520
Oh.

53:35.520 --> 53:36.520
Oh.

53:36.520 --> 53:37.520
Oh.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.520
Rocking.

53:38.520 --> 53:41.520
Little did Julius know the door was just a little bit ajar.

53:41.520 --> 53:45.520
So when he kicks it, it kicks hard and like smashes into the wall.

53:45.520 --> 53:50.520
It looks like he kicked it open, like forced it open, but it was just gonna happen anyway.

53:50.520 --> 53:51.520
Whoa.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.520
Dude.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.520
What the fuck?

53:54.520 --> 53:57.520
Cal Colorado City Action News, step aside.

53:57.520 --> 53:59.520
No persuing.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.520
That's hilarious.

54:01.520 --> 54:05.520
Did he roll the crit fail?

54:05.520 --> 54:06.520
29.

54:06.520 --> 54:08.520
I pass.

54:08.520 --> 54:14.520
The cigarette trembling, still stuck on his lip as he just like quivers and backs up.

54:14.520 --> 54:19.520
And he's just like going to light his cigarette in front of him, but the cigarette's not there

54:19.520 --> 54:21.520
as he just kind of backs away.

54:21.520 --> 54:25.520
Cal pushes everybody through and after they're up the stairs, I turn around and I'm like,

54:25.520 --> 54:28.520
don't hassle my people again.

54:28.520 --> 54:32.520
He goes, yes, sir.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.520
Good boy.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.520
Which apartment is hers?

54:34.520 --> 54:35.520
I don't know.

54:35.520 --> 54:37.520
Kick down all the doors.

54:38.520 --> 54:39.520
We do know, right?

54:39.520 --> 54:41.520
Yes, Beck Wilder does know.

54:41.520 --> 54:44.520
I mean, in the fiction, I said I dropped her off.

54:44.520 --> 54:46.520
But you said that's her window.

54:46.520 --> 54:47.520
You did point at her window, you creep.

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
Okay, yeah.

54:48.520 --> 54:52.520
It would be this one back here.

54:52.520 --> 54:53.520
That's my favorite rock.

54:53.520 --> 54:54.520
In the fiction, I said I dropped her off.

54:54.520 --> 55:00.520
I didn't tell you that I'd gone around the back and know exactly where she lives.

55:00.520 --> 55:06.520
I actually rented a place across the street with a good view.

55:06.520 --> 55:11.520
Let me see, if I'm parked over there, then that would make it...

55:11.520 --> 55:12.520
Is it this one?

55:12.520 --> 55:15.520
And there's a doormat that just says Vivica on it.

55:15.520 --> 55:18.520
Welcome to Vivica's place, the editor.

55:24.520 --> 55:27.520
Julius wants to knock very aggressively on the door.

55:30.520 --> 55:32.520
Vivica, give us our shit back!

55:33.520 --> 55:34.520
Vivica?

55:34.520 --> 55:37.520
Cowcall her out of here with Beck and Julius.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.520
Hey, I'm here. I'm here.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.520
We just want to talk.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.520
Zach leaned away from the mic.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.520
He's not gonna...

55:42.520 --> 55:45.520
Yeah, like a toddler refusing to be fed.

55:47.520 --> 55:48.520
Julius is gonna...

55:48.520 --> 55:49.520
Go away!

55:52.520 --> 55:53.520
Okay.

55:53.520 --> 55:54.520
Wink.

55:54.520 --> 55:57.520
You should open the door, though, for the next people to come in.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.520
Great idea.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.520
We'll get plumber's jumpsuits.

56:02.520 --> 56:04.520
And fake mustaches.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
Vivica, it's back.

56:07.520 --> 56:12.520
Look, I know that you think you're maybe doing something good, and maybe you are.

56:12.520 --> 56:16.520
Hey, are you just in there editing the footage with another pass like we talked about, maybe?

56:16.520 --> 56:20.520
We just realized that the footage wasn't on us, and we figured maybe you had it,

56:20.520 --> 56:23.520
and we want to make sure that we get backups.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.520
Vivica, I haven't felt this way about a story in nearly 30 years,

56:27.520 --> 56:33.520
and I think that caused me to be fairly short-sighted about showing you what was really on there.

56:33.520 --> 56:36.520
So I want to say, I'm sorry. We're sorry.

56:36.520 --> 56:38.520
We're really sorry, Vivica.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.520
Would you let us in to talk about it?

56:41.520 --> 56:42.520
The door opens.

56:42.520 --> 56:46.520
Vivica stands in front of you, eyes red.

56:46.520 --> 56:51.520
She has been through hell since the last time you saw her,

56:51.520 --> 56:56.520
and she is trying so hard not to burst into tears again.

56:56.520 --> 56:59.520
I was going to delete the...

56:59.520 --> 57:02.520
I was going to delete...

57:02.520 --> 57:07.520
I took the thumb drive, I'm sure that you yelled, I understand.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.520
It was pretty funny, the sign.

57:10.520 --> 57:11.520
I was going to... which sign?

57:11.520 --> 57:13.520
Kick me?

57:13.520 --> 57:15.520
She laughs a little bit.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.520
There's the Vivica we all know.

57:17.520 --> 57:18.520
Okay, yeah, thank you.

57:18.520 --> 57:22.520
So I had a plan. I was going to take the footage, I was going to bring it back here,

57:22.520 --> 57:25.520
I was going to figure out what to do with it, I was going to talk to people,

57:25.520 --> 57:27.520
I was going to figure it out, I was going to talk to people,

57:27.520 --> 57:30.520
I was going to let you in on it too, but we were high energy

57:30.520 --> 57:32.520
and you guys seemed so gung-ho about getting it out

57:32.520 --> 57:34.520
and I didn't want to get it out because I'm scared to get it out

57:34.520 --> 57:38.520
because it's scary and terrifying and I needed to tell somebody else

57:38.520 --> 57:40.520
and I needed to get somebody else's opinion.

57:40.520 --> 57:46.520
So I decided to go wait and hide in the parking lot until after you all left

57:46.520 --> 57:50.520
and then I went back into the building and I was going to go delete all the footage.

57:50.520 --> 57:52.520
I wasn't going to delete it, but I was going to bring it back here

57:52.520 --> 57:55.520
and I was always going to have the edit, but wait, let me fucking finish.

57:55.520 --> 58:01.520
Cops came and they took it. The cops fucking took it all.

58:01.520 --> 58:06.520
Why? They weren't even in uniform, they just came in and they took it

58:06.520 --> 58:09.520
and where were you? You weren't there. No one was there.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.520
And I couldn't do anything.

58:11.520 --> 58:13.520
Did they take the thumb drive?

58:13.520 --> 58:14.520
Yeah.

58:14.520 --> 58:15.520
Can I hear a bit of that?

58:19.520 --> 58:20.520
Yawn.

58:20.520 --> 58:21.520
Yawning.

58:22.520 --> 58:23.520
Yeah, yeah.

58:23.520 --> 58:25.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:25.520 --> 58:27.520
Can I hear a bit of that?

58:30.520 --> 58:33.520
Zach doesn't seem like he's taking this very seriously.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.520
Better throw out a yawn.

58:39.520 --> 58:40.520
Great, great show.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.520
Yeah, good stuff, Zach.

58:45.520 --> 58:46.520
This is great, this is great.

58:46.520 --> 58:48.520
This is not like it when I yell at him.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.520
It's late, I'm sleepy.

58:52.520 --> 58:55.520
I thought it was fun when you yelled at me.

58:57.520 --> 59:01.520
I just thought you sounded insincere when you said that last thing,

59:01.520 --> 59:03.520
so I want to be human.

59:03.520 --> 59:05.520
I don't remember what it was, but what did you roll?

59:05.520 --> 59:07.520
It was about them taking the thumb drive.

59:07.520 --> 59:08.520
Oh, the thumb drive.

59:08.520 --> 59:09.520
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.

59:09.520 --> 59:10.520
Ooh, 24, a pass.

59:10.520 --> 59:11.520
Yeah, no, she seems sincere.

59:11.520 --> 59:14.520
You said they weren't in uniform, how do you know they were cops?

59:15.520 --> 59:20.520
Came out of a cop car, went back into a cop car, showed me a badge, had guns.

59:20.520 --> 59:21.520
Not nice.

59:21.520 --> 59:22.520
Did you see a name?

59:22.520 --> 59:24.520
It oinks like a pig.

59:27.520 --> 59:30.520
Were the badges City Police Department?

59:30.520 --> 59:31.520
Yeah.

59:31.520 --> 59:34.520
I'm looking at the other guys, why would the police even know about it,

59:34.520 --> 59:36.520
let alone want to come and get it?

59:36.520 --> 59:37.520
Why would they want the footage like that?

59:37.520 --> 59:39.520
Do you have a ring camera?

59:39.520 --> 59:40.520
They got it from the...

59:40.520 --> 59:41.520
At the office?

59:41.520 --> 59:42.520
At the office, not here.

59:42.520 --> 59:44.520
Does the office have a ring camera?

59:44.520 --> 59:45.520
I'd assume the office has...

59:45.520 --> 59:46.520
A lot of cameras.

59:46.520 --> 59:49.520
We can see if these guys are real cops, what kind of car they pulled up in.

59:49.520 --> 59:52.520
So Vivica, you're saying though that at the end of the day,

59:52.520 --> 59:54.520
you don't have any of the footage at all?

59:54.520 --> 59:57.520
You weren't able to maybe sneak some?

59:57.520 --> 59:59.520
Maybe pulled out a hard drive or...

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
Just a sneaky little...

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520
Her eyes go like blank.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520
I'm talking like my good friend, Ringo.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.520
I tried to sneak some, but no, I didn't get any of them.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.520
Sounds like it could be God all demons we're working with.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520
God all demons?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520
God turtle?

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.520
Yeah, like people, you know, God all sending people out to grab the stuff.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.520
Maybe not actual demons, but who knows?

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.520
Let's go look at that footage and we've got to find...

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520
We've got to find it.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520
We can't let them have it.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.520
Cal has had like kind of an unworried little smirk on his face this whole time.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.520
Guys, I'm sorry here, but it's in the hands of the police.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.520
It's perfectly safe.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:39.520
It's perfectly safe.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.520
Cops like me.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.520
Yucky ducky.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.520
Cal answers the phone and you hear explosions and like screams in the background.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.520
And he's like, Oh God, Julius, think, think, fuck, you're out of the hospital.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.520
We got a big situation going on here with Stevie and God.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.520
Got to go.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.520
Peep.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.520
What do you do?

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520
Cal's call.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520
You get like, you see a call coming back like Cal, Colorado.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.520
I answer it.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520
I'm sorry.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.520
I forgot to tell you.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.520
I'm dropping a pin.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520
I know how to do that now.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520
Click.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.520
I wait for the pin and how far away is it?

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.520
How far away is the pin?

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.520
Like how far from the hospital is his apartment?

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.520
He gave me until noon to imagine what Cal, Colorado had gotten up to with his day.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520
Oh.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.520
And I imagined we got another pic of it.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
I thought it was real.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.520
Yeah, it was all nonsense.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.520
He's been asleep.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520
You wake him up.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.520
Yeah, I think that's fair.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:50.520
So you would have the footage on the drives that the camera records the footage onto the drives.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.520
And then you take the drives to work, load them onto the computer.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.520
You tell me how to do my job?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.520
Cause my life is great.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.520
Oh, that reminds me.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.520
I already backed it up to the cloud.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.520
We're good.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.520
Oh, sweet.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.520
I'm going to make pancakes.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.520
Cool.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.520
As you pull out your phone and look at the cloud and it's like...

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.520
It's raining.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.520
Oh, it's not there.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520
Well, that's so weird.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520
No, no, no, Zach.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520
I'm sorry.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.520
The end of music episode already started playing.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.520
We are not there yet.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.520
End of music episode.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520
The day the music died.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.520
The end of music episode.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.520
Yeah, that is some fucking dark ass shit.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:39.520
And then Cthulhu comes out and he steals music.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.520
Do you want to sing a sad song about it?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.520
You can't, nerd.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520
Cut to a child's birthday party.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.520
Happy birthday to you.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.520
Happy birthday to you.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.520
You're putting too much stank on it.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:54.520
It's still like a third of a song.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.520
Putting too much stank on it is my Spotify party playlist.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:06.520
In the morning, Thomas was putting too much stank on it.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.520
It's How Far is Heaven a hundred times.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.520
Julius runs back down and sticks his head out and says,

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.520
put that on your bagel and smear it and then runs back up.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.520
And he's like, Julius is like, fucking nailed it, yes.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.520
And it's all my fault.
