00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
What is up, my babies?

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
It is your trustworthy radio DJ father figure and confidant, Wolf the Dog,

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
and I am here to deliver you the newest of news on the newest and only radio station here in contention.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
That is right. You are tuned into 694.2. PTBP.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
And I am wet. My love of trash is strong. And I am covered in grease.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
You love that, listener. You love it.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
And I love this community. A community so trusting and smart,

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
we decided to build a delta green scenario through prompt-based writing contests.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
I, Wolf the Dog, am now announcing the winner of the first writing contest.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Drumroll, please. The winner is...

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Congratulations, you.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
In the second writing prompt, we will be creating the setting for this scenario.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Join us over at reddit.com slash pretending pod.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Thank you, trusted listeners and friends.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Fuck Mark Zuckerberg.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It is the news.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Silas Cole is the best thing that has ever happened to the small, unfortunate town of contention.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
You all should give him the respect he deserves.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
And do not question his decisions.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
The townsfolk who are going missing are not missed.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Maybe they even deserved it.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Trust in Silas Cole.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
He gave you lights.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And he is now moving your hair around in a pleasant fashion.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Why would you not trust a man like that?

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
And now, vocal and instrumental sounds combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
It is the creek rocks with canteen you hear them wolves they howl in.

01:54.000 --> 02:08.000
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

02:13.000 --> 02:27.000
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
Can't you hear them wolves howling all around my poor little darling.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
All around my poor little darling I'm afraid they'll get my darling.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
I was doing some research on hand washing during the old western times.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And just like throughout history in general.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
And there's a sentence that I want to read to you guys that stuck out to me.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
Though perhaps lesser known, an important pioneer of hand washing was the Vienna based Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Who was alive from 1818 to 1865.

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
Who realized that laboring women caught perpetual fever from doctors who went straight from the morgue to the delivery room.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh no.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
No.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Is that real?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
They had some crazy fetishes.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
It's a good observation Ignaz.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah good job that he was the one that picked up on that.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Oh no I don't think anyone believed him.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
They probably stoned him to death outside somewhere.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
You mean I gotta wash him after I touch the body? Why?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Then all the juice will be gone.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
The dead guy juice is good for the baby's immuno-system.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Immuno-systems.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah. Life ends and life begins.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Well you want to smear a little bit of wisdom on the baby's head.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
And say Simba.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
You can't breathe water. What if I wash my hands and then touch my face and drown?

04:19.000 --> 04:29.000
Listen. There's probably another study that proves that babies who weren't touched by the hands of a man who had been groping a corpse aren't as successful in life.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
So...

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I've read those studies.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah I've made them and I've read them.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I wrote the studies and I read them all the time.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
For what?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
For fun.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
For funsies?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
For funsies.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
For funsies my medical journal that I write.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Which is called For Funsies.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
If you had to be a doctor what kind of doctor would you be?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Pussy.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh my god.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Is that the medical term?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I don't know. I'm not a...

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm not a pussy doctor.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm not a pussy doctor.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Thomas Cox PD.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Don't you mean PhD?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
No.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
No? What?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I'd go Cox South.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Cox South.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Ball doctor.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Ball doctor.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Urologist probably.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
A pee-pee doctor.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
You don't pee out your balls Luke.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah but it's close.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
That's where it's stored though.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
We're all very good at science.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Zack even a first grader knows that.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
That's your pee Zack.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
I'm a doctor Zack.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Pee-pee.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
And I am here since.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Excuse me what did you say?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Pee-pee.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Pee-pee.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
That's what I studied in medical school.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm a physical penologist.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
A penologist.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm a penologist.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
I can tune pianos and I can look at your pee-pee.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Well I think I'm a piano doctor.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
What is it? You have to have 10,000 hours to be a master?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Yeah.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah you have all kinds.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm a 30 times master.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You can be a man in what? A week?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
How many hours are in a week?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Five hundred twenty-five thousand.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Five thousand six hundred.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred hours.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
That's how long it takes to get good at pee-pee doctoring.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You can take that out.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm not gonna now.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
But he won't now.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
You never do it Thomas so I know you won't do it for anyone else.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Is Dr. Pimple Popper, is she a dermatologist?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That's what I would be.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Wait do you like that shit?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Dude I love that shit.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You wanna like fuck with cysts and shits?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Yeah cut them out.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Do you do it to other people? Like are you into that?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah I have. I like doing them on myself.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I admit I like popping my own pimples and stuff like that.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
But I don't like seeing it on somebody else.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't like pimple popping videos.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Yeah me either.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm a proud subscriber of the popping subreddit.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
But that's about something else right?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Nope.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
We should compare each other's subreddits sometimes.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Mine's extremely boring.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah mine's super boring.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Mine's probably pretty boring too but I bet there would be interesting things we'd find.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Like subreddits we didn't know about.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We got 13 or 30.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Wait what?

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
13 or 30 it's pictures of people that could be 13 or 30.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I follow that one yeah.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Abrupt Chaos is a pretty good one.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Aged Like Milk is a pretty good one.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
I like that one too.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Are yours just like being mean to weird people?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Do you have any like not?

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah how many like science, arts, and culture subreddits do you follow?

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
I follow Animals Being Derps.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Ate the Onion is always a good one.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
That one's too depressing for me.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
I only follow two subreddits.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Awful Taste but Great Execution and Male Fashion.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Those are the only two.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
That's all you need really. It balances you out.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Sometimes I can't tell the difference.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
What was it? Awful Taste but Great Execution?

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Oh I remember is that where you sent us the weird like McDonald's shoes or whatever?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh yeah those were actually dope though.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Yeah the best part is like people arguing about whether or not the thing is actually awesome.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
I follow the Pretending to be People subreddit where I issue fan theories.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Will not be silenced.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
I follow the Kanye subreddit and the top post right now is

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
That's Enough Mr. West Please No More Today.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Posted right after that Harriet Tubman shit.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Did you see that?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh no.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
That was bad.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
It's a sad story of mental illness that is a true bummer.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
But you know when he gets real bad that he's got an album coming out soon.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah but he hasn't put out good music since Yeezus.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Alright so.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
That's not true. Life of Pablo was fucking dope.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh I thought.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Don't Refute the Gym Luke.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Well I love Kanye West.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
His word is law.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
It's the Wild West there aren't anyone else.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It sounded like you called him Kanye West.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Kanye West.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Is that not how you say it?

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
It's just like a 65 year old white woman doing karaoke to Kanye.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
I'd watch that.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm trying to think of like the funniest.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
The funniest lines of Kanye West that the old white woman could do.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah you probably shouldn't say those so let's dig in here.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
Let's gold dig in here to the Old West.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeehaw.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Yeehaw.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I'm trying to say that once per episode.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Root and toot and shootin.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeehaw.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Hold on before we start.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Cause we haven't gone long enough before we started.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah people love this.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
How many times do you think people actually said Yeehaw back in the day?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Well let's find out.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm googling.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
Two million five hundred and forty thousand three hundred and eighty.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
It meant hello and goodbye.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Oh.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So yeah all the time.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeehaw means family.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
God I want a tattoo that says Yeehaw means family on my back.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And it's stitched with a cowboy hat and boots.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Just now?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Oh no.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Should we all stop?

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
One two three five six seven.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
That was cool we kind of had like a clip clap.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
Like horses hooves on the ground right outside of the church here in the 1880 somethings in contention.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Who's on a horse?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
You know Jack Pearlman's on a horse come on.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
I'm on a horse.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Come on hey mister.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Everett did not bring his horse into town.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
He walked in.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
I'd like to think that Everett has a very small donkey he rides on.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Can we make that happen?

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
I'm not going to play unless it's a talking raccoon.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Jesus.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
That's a throwback for just the group.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Inside jokes are great for podcasts.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But that did actually happen we had a player say that.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah and Delta Green.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
So she was a talking raccoon.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
So how do we get out of this?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
What kind of horse are you riding Jack?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
That is the good question.

12:01.000 --> 12:07.000
I think we established between me and Zach it's a big old brown good solid like work horse.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
Not like an agile like racing horse like this one can like carry a wagon around.

12:13.000 --> 12:21.000
Very sturdy beautiful horse named Jeremiah whom I love and I think Jack also loves.

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
Ephraim has a big brown and white Clydesdale named hey mister.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
H-A-Y mister.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Love it.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Love it.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
I think that's the horse maybe I have too is the Clydesdale the weird like.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Budweiser horse.

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Yeah the Clydesdale is the one you can use in Red Dead but that you would absolutely never ever ride in real life.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Right.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
They're too majestic.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
But mine I'm such a big guy that I've got to have a big old horse.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Okay I don't have that guy I just got a big fun horse.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I'll write that down.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Can you write that down so we don't forget.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Big fun horse.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Big fun horse Jeremiah.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Professor Horace Green did you ride in town?

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah he rents a horse from the local livery stable.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Horcery.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Uh huh.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah he's got whatever horse they gave him today.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
I'm seated on my horse and I look over at Horace.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Is that animal sick?

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
It sounds a little hoarse.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Gosh.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
And Ephraim slaps his knee and laughs to himself.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
God damn it Ephraim.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
It's just no it's just a standard American quarter horse and I think it's in fine health.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
It was a joke.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
I don't follow.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
It sounds hoarse.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
It's a horse.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:54.000
Well uh we had a plan to do something right?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Yeah I reckon we were gonna head over there.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And I point to the midpoint between the cemetery and my place.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
We were thinking we were gonna see if she dropped off those bodies somewhere.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Are you uh you just walking?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I mean I'll be way behind you guys if I do a walk.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
Perhaps you should perhaps you should hop on the back of this man's gigantic Clydesdale

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
here.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Bobby Custard speaks up and is like.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Would you be okay with with Everett hopping on the back of yours if not you know Everett

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Everett there's a good place right here on the back of old Bucky.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
Bucky looks like a good place for you to ride and Bucky is a gorgeous black horse.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
If you're offering space on Bucky there I'll take it.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
And as Everett Pace hops up onto Bucky.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
It's it's kind of a slow arduous process.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
His old rickety bones getting up there.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I used to be able to ride all over this countryside but now it's hard to get up on.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
That's why I keep the donkey at my place.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
It's easier to get up on.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
It's a little shorter you know.

14:54.000 --> 15:00.000
And a sheepish young girl is approaching as Everett Pace is trying to get up and you all

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
would know her.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Her name is Elizabeth Connor.

15:03.000 --> 15:10.000
She lives in contention and Judge Cortland you would remember her as a friend of your

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
deceased daughter.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
What's sheepish about her?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Is she like furry?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Woolly.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
No when she opens her mouth she's just like.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
She has a Serta mattress.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah one of the Serta sheep comes bouncing up to you.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.000
And I won't play if I can't be that Serta sheep.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
How close is she to us?

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
She's approaching right now and she is walking up behind Everett.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Hi there folks.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Hey Lizzie.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh hi there Judge Cortland.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It's good to see you.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
I don't reckon I didn't mean to cause nothing but.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Speak up.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
And she walks right over to Cortland and is.

15:59.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah I didn't want to say anything with Mr. Cole around.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
But this morning I overheard Mr. and Mrs. Cole there arguing something loud and fiery.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
And I did hear they were screaming about copper wire.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I heard them talking about it.

16:22.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah he had some copper wire for those fans but I think it's got something to do with

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
my copper wire.

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
Well I heard him yell and he was real angry that she took some.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
She took some?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Why did she take some?

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
I reckon I don't have any sort of idea.

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
I was just fetching some water and happened over here and when you came in Judge screaming

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
and hollering about how your copper wire had been done taking.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I thought maybe.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I mean I would hate to think that of the Coles.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't know.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I don't trust any of them.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
He's always seemed a little off to me.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
We don't agree about much but on this we definitely do.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Creepy little fella.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
I don't trust a man with pants that big.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Never can never should.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And Elizabeth's father hollers for her.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I better be long now.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I just wanted to pass that on to you.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Do with it what you will I suppose.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Thanks for the heads up Lizzie.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
And with that she's gone and during that entire conversation Everett Pace was just.

17:32.000 --> 17:42.000
Now we got you.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Okay now you're back on here.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Okay and just don't hold on too tight there.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Yep.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Okay.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Now I think maybe and the crowd is leaving.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
They kind of do that thing that big crowds do where they're congregating like a congregation

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
in front of the church.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
So they're all like saying their goodbyes but it's taking them a while to leave and

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Custard.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Alright yeah maybe let's just take a.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
What?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Hey.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
That's what horses are.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
Custard delete this if it turns out I asked you about this last time but do you know anything

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
about a local gambler named Thomas?

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
Oh yes actually Thomas was the one in there that disappeared back.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Oh six days ago?

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Well that's right Judge the young lady who just spoke to us mentioned that she overheard

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
the woman she was referring to having having an argument with Miss with Mr. Cole.

18:40.000 --> 18:48.000
I also I overheard some of the minors mentioning that Thomas had had gotten in a terrible conflagration

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
with Mr. Cole that they had argued fiercely shortly before his disappearance.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
I don't know if that's any help to the mystery but there it is.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Luke can you hear Thomas?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It was very roboty.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Shit really?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah I was having trouble understanding some of it.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
I could hear I could like understand what you're saying but.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
It sounds like you're talking into a big fan with how roboty it is.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Still?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
Maybe leave the Zoom call and hop on back in.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah that whole time he was talking I was like well I can kind of get it I don't know

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
if we're gonna interrupt and say anything but.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I was having trouble following.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Hello?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Hey.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
How is it?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Still roboty?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Still bad.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
Damn it I was saving that burp for when I talk next time but I'll get another one.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Rick and Morty style.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Save up all the burps for when you speak.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Hey Zach what's that shirt you got on?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I've never seen it before.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
I only have like four shirts that I like.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Same.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
I ain't clear this some bitchin' closet on out.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
Get me some proper western attire so I can get in character.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
I show up in like a full cowboy garb for the next episode.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That would have been fun.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
We should start doing costumes for the Patreon.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Hell yeah.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Me and Joe can just wear our weird luchador masks.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
We play luchadors in every single one shot from here on out.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
It's the only silly mask I have.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
There is a worldwide wrestling RPG that looks fucking hilarious.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I could be George W. Bush.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
I have a mask of that.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Oh man you should have just been GW for this one.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Okay so am I still a robot?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Yeah.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
How about now?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Still fan.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Very roboty.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Okay I'm gonna restart.

20:51.000 --> 20:59.000
I think it's worse if that helps you at all.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I'm stopping my audacity track.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Okay.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Pause.

21:03.000 --> 21:13.000
Yeah let's all just pause it.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
Five, six, seven.

21:19.000 --> 21:27.000
So that's all I know about Thomas.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Does anybody know?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Go ahead and run it back.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I think we got a pretty good one.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Oh I'm sure we did but they didn't hear you.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
They didn't understand you.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
Oh all that gotcha.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.000
Yes well the gist of it is that I overheard some of the miners talking about Thomas and

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
Mr. Cole getting in a terrible argument shortly before his disappearance.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.000
And apparently he'd made some kind of great discovery down there.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I'm not sure what it was.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Thomas had made the discovery or Cole had?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Cole makes discoveries every day.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Thomas found something in Mr. Cole's mine.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
What was it?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
A goo.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Like oil?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Do you strike oil?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Living oil.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
That sounds like a bit crazy if you ask me.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm a man of science and I have seen many things.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
You think maybe they hit like a gas leak or something down there making him feel a little

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
wacky?

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Judge with all due respect, is there a gas leak in your own home?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Why do you do the things you do?

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
He's just got his mouth open unsure how to respond.

22:38.000 --> 22:47.000
I like this science guy a lot.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
Now I don't know much about science and about living goo but I know that you did just roast

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
this man's beans and for that I do applaud you.

22:58.000 --> 23:05.000
Now maybe we should be off instead of talking about hypotheticals of living slime and whatnot.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Sounds too goofy to me.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
Yes, I completely agree unless there's anything else that people aren't telling each other

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
that might help us solve this case on the way there.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
I know this is of limited interest to the rest of you but I would like it to be established

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
scientifically and for all posterity from now in the 1880s that this is a goo.

23:30.000 --> 23:37.000
It's called a goo.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I reckon I like that a whole lot.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
We'll name it after young Thomas.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Thomas goo?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You want to call it the Thomas goo, huh?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Thomas goo.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
No, no, no, no.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Bottle that up.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Thomas's goo?

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
Of course it will have a name in Latin that will roughly translate to Thomas's goo.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Does anyone here know Latin?

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
I actually do, but it would be above you.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You wouldn't understand it.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
You say I just hear static.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
I'm just sure of it.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
What's static?

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
Oh, uh, well see Silas Cole found out about electricity and sometimes it makes a weird

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
zzzz noise.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Ah, I know some Latin.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I know habeas corpus.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I don't, I don't think you do.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
Tell me, go ahead and tell the class what habeas corpus means, Ephraim.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
Well, speaking of habeas corpus, don't we got some corpuses to find?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Let's go.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
General natural world for those of you who have natural world.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
Oh shit, I got to find my character sheet.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
18 on a 40.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
It's a one.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
I passed with a one.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Hell yeah.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Oh, holy shit.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Nice.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Where are the, I have my character sheet pulled up and I can't find it.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
There's too many fucking.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Oh no, I restarted.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
God damn it.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Oh, thank God.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
I still have it.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Let's get all these things back up.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Apologies.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Apologies.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Y'all need not roll.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Okay.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
We got a one Everett pace.

25:07.000 --> 25:15.000
Looking up into the sky, you see three vultures circling about a half mile down the road and

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
right down there, there's a row of homes.

25:17.000 --> 25:25.000
Uh, just a little, uh, early idea of a suburb happening down here on the west side of contention.

25:25.000 --> 25:32.000
You can just hear these vultures.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
The vultures are barking?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Yeah, a little bit.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
To seemingly no one, Horace Green pipes up and says, actually, the concept of the suburb

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
dates to the Roman times.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
Uh, meaning it comes from suburbus, meaning beyond the city.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
Oh, is that Latin?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
What?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
I'm sorry.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
I was just thinking out loud.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And Everett, you would know that that is the sound vultures make.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
Uh, you just, just like in general, I looked it up.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Hey, listen here fellas, them vultures, there's three of them up there.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
They're barking.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I've had vultures follow me around before.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Uh, usually take a shower, bath after that, but I've heard them bark.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Don't you figure for, uh, if we're looking for bodies, there's a good chance that, uh,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
they're circling a body.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I mean, might as well check there.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I think that's a wonderful observation Everett.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
That's a good start Everett.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Thanks everyone.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
You're welcome.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
We all love you and cherish you.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
Which is exactly what Joe had in mind with this character.

26:34.000 --> 26:40.000
Horace Green has never heard another man speak that way to a man, much less heard a

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
man get that kind of positive affirmation in his life at this point in the 1880s.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
So sad.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
He doesn't know what to do with it, but he feels, he feels all of a sudden like something's

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
missing that he didn't know about before.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Oh no.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
Maybe it'll help him grow to become a better man.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
He mutters, does the patriarchy hurt men too?

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Jesus Christ.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
As we approach and get closer, I want to pull my gun out and try to shoot one of the buzzers.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Okay.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
Everyone roll animal handling except for the judge who does this so often that his horse

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
is used to it.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Totally used to it.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I don't think I passed.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I think you got to roll it for me.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm not, I'm not controlling this bad boy.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
How about you roll it for me?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Oh.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Could I roll ride?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Either way, I failed hard.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Yeah, same.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
I rolled a 92.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
I failed.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
I failed hard as well.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Oh no.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
What?

27:42.000 --> 27:49.000
I put all my points into drive wagon thinking I could just drive us around in a wagon.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Your sick party wagon.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
I should have.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Science party wagon.

27:53.000 --> 27:59.000
Well, I figured he went out to his dinosaurs bones every day with a little, with a little

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
wagon.

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
So horse green is leading you guys in this wagon that you're all sitting in the back

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
of.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
Look over there vultures.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Thankfully Everett sitting right up front.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
He notices he's um, no, this, this sucks.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Uh, so as soon as, uh, firearms.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Oh yes.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Absolutely.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
Oh, please don't quit failure.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
Firearms are all that you didn't have to roll a second.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
15 on a 50.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Ooh, that's a dead bird.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Do you want to describe it as we're riding up?

28:37.000 --> 28:46.000
I pull my gun out and ate all my bacon last night and pop, shoot a, shoot a vulture and

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
the vulture, uh, shrieks except for they don't shrink.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
They bark.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.120
It's just like, and it turns over and immediately begins falling to the ground and the other

28:58.120 --> 29:01.960
two begin circling just a little bit lower.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.960
The horses.

29:02.960 --> 29:03.960
Let's see.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.960
We got Bucky.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.960
We got Jeremiah.

29:05.960 --> 29:06.960
Thank you.

29:06.960 --> 29:07.960
Yeah, we got Bucky.

29:07.960 --> 29:14.000
We got Jeremiah and then the rental, his name's hurts.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.400
So you guys can push this role if you would like, uh, on either ride or animal handling

29:20.400 --> 29:30.760
in order to try to basically at the apex of this horse trying to knock you off, you can

29:30.760 --> 29:37.000
push the role to try something a little bit different to hold on tight and regain control.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.600
However, if you fail that role, it'll be a crit fail.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.200
The screen doesn't have time to push.

29:42.200 --> 29:47.120
He just gets bucked straight off the back of the horse and is suddenly on his backside.

29:47.120 --> 29:53.680
Jack Pearlman tries to, to emotionally and mentally connect with his best friend, Jeremiah,

29:53.680 --> 29:58.760
the horse, and like hugs really tightly to its neck and tries to whisper into its ear

29:58.760 --> 30:00.960
to calm down Jeremiah.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.960
It's just me now.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.960
Okay.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.160
Did you put points into horse whispering?

30:05.160 --> 30:08.280
Hell yeah.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.600
Natural world, baby.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.680
I pa- uh, 58 on a 70.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.680
So I pass.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.680
All right.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.800
And the Everett Pace, uh, we're both kind of hanging on by a thread here.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.640
What are you going to do?

30:20.640 --> 30:25.200
So I'm really scared to push because if you fail a push, it's a crit fail, right?

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
That is correct.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.200
Yeah.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.760
Uh, I'm not going to push.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
Okay.

30:29.760 --> 30:36.960
Everett Pace, you fall off and the preacher, preacher, sheriff, Bobby Custard, I forgot

30:36.960 --> 30:37.960
his name completely.

30:37.960 --> 30:43.240
I dare you forget everyone's favorite character, Bobby Custard.

30:43.240 --> 30:47.080
And uh, preacher, sheriff, Bobby Custard falls directly on you.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.720
You're going to lose one hit point.

30:49.720 --> 30:55.480
And professor horse green, you fall off as well, losing a single hit point and the horses

30:55.480 --> 31:06.160
just stay near, thankfully, uh, they kind of trot in circles and Jack Pearlman, you

31:06.160 --> 31:13.600
grab on tight and you pull yourself forward, your legs dangling like you're Superman riding

31:13.600 --> 31:14.600
this horse.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.120
Like I'm doing a sick plank almost on my horse.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.120
Exactly.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.760
What do you whisper in its ear?

31:19.760 --> 31:22.240
None of this loss in translation bullshit.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.800
All right, Jeremiah, it's just me and you now.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.160
We got this.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.140
Come on now, Jeremiah, come on now.

31:29.140 --> 31:33.700
And I'm like petting it's under, under its neck like you do with a weird doggy or with

31:33.700 --> 31:34.700
your fat cat.

31:34.700 --> 31:42.380
And Jeremiah sits down on its butt to where you're standing on the ground and then slowly

31:42.380 --> 31:47.260
rises from the back so that you just kind of slide back up on.

31:47.260 --> 31:52.740
As a good horse, Jeremiah, I have a sugar cube that I feed Jeremiah.

31:52.740 --> 31:56.660
Can you, can you, can you role play that for me please?

31:56.660 --> 31:57.660
Yeah.

31:57.660 --> 32:00.220
Here, watch what I do.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.220
Watch what I do.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.040
Hold on Zach, let me get it on back of you real quick.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.560
Ooh, I like that.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.560
I like it.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.560
I certainly don't.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.560
I certainly do not.

32:08.560 --> 32:13.640
Well, some of us don't like real role-playing Joe and some of us love real role-playing.

32:15.640 --> 32:16.640
Oh God.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.640
Yeah, that's good.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.640
Oh God.

32:18.640 --> 32:19.640
Oh God.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.640
Are you okay?

32:20.640 --> 32:23.800
Did you hurt yourself role-playing as Jeremiah?

32:23.800 --> 32:25.560
Did you feel like a horse for a second?

32:25.560 --> 32:28.000
Was it hard to take yourself back out of being a horse?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Okay, you're Zach.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
You're Zach.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
You're Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Everett's laying on the ground.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
Hold on, while Zach was a horse, he shit all over the place.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Let's see it.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
We'll let him pick that up.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Role-play it now.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Good thing he ate grass today.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Do it.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Do it.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Shit.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Show us your poo.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
Everett, are you, are you, are you okay?

33:01.960 --> 33:02.960
God damn it, Judge.

33:02.960 --> 33:03.960
What the?

33:03.960 --> 33:04.960
God damn it.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.960
I'm holding out a hand for the Sheriff.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.960
Looks like you've fallen and you can't giddy up.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.960
That was pretty good.

33:19.960 --> 33:25.960
I don't got time for this and I ride my horse over to where the bird fell.

33:26.920 --> 33:30.920
Everett, you know, there's room on the back of this saddle for another if you'd rather

33:30.920 --> 33:32.920
be with someone a little more experienced.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.920
Well, that wasn't Bobby's fault.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.920
God damn Judge shooting a gun out of nowhere and pissed off all those horses.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.920
He should have known better.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
God damn it.

33:41.920 --> 33:46.920
I completely agree and I will say that Jack is a better rider than I am, that's for damn

33:46.920 --> 33:47.920
sure.

33:47.920 --> 33:53.920
However, not my fault, Judge Cortland, but you know, he kind of does what he does.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
We can't all agree.

33:55.880 --> 34:00.880
Professor Green is watching his horse just run off back to the stable in town, just over

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
the hill.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.880
Completely all the way home.

34:05.880 --> 34:06.880
Yeah.

34:06.880 --> 34:12.880
He's like, uh, well, I, I, I think I need a ride, uh, from, from whoever's, from whichever

34:12.880 --> 34:16.880
horse is behind that Mr. Pace does not occupy.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.880
All right.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.880
It's the bachelor time.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.880
Just hand out your rose, Everett.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.880
Wait, what?

34:27.880 --> 34:30.880
You gotta pick a horse to get on.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.880
I thought that, that we were helping each other back onto the horses.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.880
Yeah, you're probably right.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.880
I'm already, I'm already riding up there with Bobby.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.880
I was just giving you another shot if you wanted to get on my horse.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.880
Uh, Horace, you can go on, you can go on and get up here.

34:50.840 --> 34:55.840
I know you probably don't want to get on Ephraim's and I reached my arm out to like, heave him

34:55.840 --> 34:56.840
up with me.

34:56.840 --> 34:57.840
Thank you, Mr. Bowman.

34:57.840 --> 34:58.840
You're welcome.

34:58.840 --> 35:04.840
As you guys are click clacking down this dusty old ass pathway in between some of these houses,

35:04.840 --> 35:10.840
large plots of land, but houses closer, maybe a hundred yards apart, give them some space,

35:10.840 --> 35:16.840
but not nearly as much as being out a little bit outside of town lends you a lot more room

35:17.800 --> 35:19.800
like Pace or Perlman's places.

35:19.800 --> 35:26.800
And as you guys are heading on down here, you see that there is a modest wooden cabin

35:26.800 --> 35:30.800
with a covered wraparound front porch.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.800
There is a watermelon patch out front.

35:33.800 --> 35:38.800
To the side, there's a herd of cows nearby on the side of the house.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.800
And you guys would know this place is called the Brick House.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.800
Ow!

35:42.800 --> 35:45.800
B-R-I-C-K-H-A-U-S.

35:46.760 --> 35:47.760
Is it mighty mighty?

35:47.760 --> 35:48.760
It's mighty mighty.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.760
It's the kind you don't take home to mother.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.760
That's a super freak.

35:52.760 --> 35:53.760
I know.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.760
That's my favorite mashup.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.760
She's a brick house.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.760
The kind you don't take home to mother.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.760
And also mashed up are all of these watermelons.

36:04.760 --> 36:11.760
You see as you're approaching, every single watermelon in this watermelon patch has been

36:11.760 --> 36:12.760
destroyed.

36:13.720 --> 36:19.720
And on the front porch, there's a very tall, very buff woman who is crying.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.720
She's weeping very openly.

36:21.720 --> 36:26.720
And you know that this is Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno.

36:26.720 --> 36:35.720
Big ol' shout out to M from Michigan, a citizen of contention and a $10 level backer tier

36:35.720 --> 36:39.720
backer patreon.com slash pretending pod.

36:40.680 --> 36:48.680
Thank you M from Michigan for both Greer Hilfintop Kamonkarno as well as the Brick House gym.

36:48.680 --> 36:54.680
Before anybody can say anything, Horace Green has never seen this person and he just says,

36:54.680 --> 36:58.680
Hello ma'am, have you seen any interesting bones on your property?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.680
I...

37:00.680 --> 37:03.680
Perhaps now is not the time.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.680
What happened to your vegetables?

37:05.680 --> 37:06.680
Their fruits.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
Melons.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.680
My melons?

37:10.640 --> 37:12.640
They are...

37:12.640 --> 37:14.640
They have been completely destroyed.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.640
And I...

37:19.640 --> 37:21.640
I woke up in the night...

37:25.640 --> 37:28.640
Please tie up your horses and come here.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.640
The church is perfect.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.640
Preach your sheriff.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.640
Come here.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.640
Hear my story.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
Where are you from?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.600
Contention!

37:42.600 --> 37:44.600
Ephraim's already on the ground.

37:44.600 --> 37:50.600
He bends over to get the buzzard he shot and he shoves it in a bag on his horse and leads

37:50.600 --> 37:56.600
his horse over to the porch and ties the horse up and just kind of looks at her.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
It was an excellent shot.

37:58.600 --> 38:06.600
It has been circling ever since last night when one of my cows, my beautiful, beautiful

38:07.560 --> 38:09.560
is completely eviscerated.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.560
Like...

38:11.560 --> 38:13.560
Like wolves or...

38:13.560 --> 38:15.560
They must have been wolves.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.560
Can you show me the way to this here cow?

38:18.560 --> 38:21.560
Horace, I'm going to need you with me on this one.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.560
Well of course, I've always happened to lead my biological expertise.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.560
Do I know this woman?

38:26.560 --> 38:28.560
Yeah, and she just started...

38:28.560 --> 38:34.560
The brick house is a place where people can come work out.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.560
Where they can work out?

38:37.520 --> 38:44.520
She's a fitness person and she teaches people of all ages and credos here in contention

38:44.520 --> 38:51.520
how to do that cool thing where you destroy a watermelon with your thighs.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.520
Nice.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.520
Oh that sounds fun, I'd like to learn.

38:56.520 --> 39:02.520
If only you could because I am all out of watermelons.

39:03.480 --> 39:07.480
Since this was supposed to last me through next year, are we just harvest?

39:07.480 --> 39:12.480
I'm going to look down at the watermelon patch and search through it to see if there's any...

39:12.480 --> 39:18.480
I want to see if there's anything in there that's not just like dirt or leaves or watermelon pulp.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.480
Yeah, go ahead and roll.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.480
Spot hidden maybe?

39:23.480 --> 39:25.480
You could roll spot hidden.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.480
You could roll...

39:27.480 --> 39:29.480
Archaeology.

39:29.480 --> 39:31.480
I'll do spot hidden.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
50 on a...

39:34.440 --> 39:36.440
45, that's a fail.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.440
So you're looking around and you see footprints all over this place.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.440
Two different sets.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.440
How big?

39:42.440 --> 39:46.440
Neither large, they're medium to small as far as feet go in the world.

39:46.440 --> 39:50.440
Hey, are these your footprints down here, ma'am?

39:50.440 --> 39:52.440
No, I have not stepped foot.

39:52.440 --> 39:56.440
I looked from the porch but all of them, they have been gone.

39:56.440 --> 40:00.440
Boy, it looks like there's been two perps smashing melons.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.400
Yeah, there was a fight.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.400
A fight?

40:05.400 --> 40:07.400
A melon fight.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.400
It's two women.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.400
You saw them?

40:11.400 --> 40:16.400
Yes, it evoked me from my slumber and I got up and I looked and I watched them.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.400
They were destroying everything in the melon patch.

40:19.400 --> 40:25.400
They were stepping all over it and they had no regard for my watermelons.

40:25.400 --> 40:29.400
So you don't think they were here just to smash your property?

40:30.360 --> 40:36.360
No, one was catching the other but I cannot believe with how.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.360
How?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.360
She's shaking her head and she's crying and she's like...

40:40.360 --> 40:42.360
I...

40:42.360 --> 40:46.360
My distress must have caused me to see things.

40:46.360 --> 40:49.360
What did your distress cause you to see?

40:49.360 --> 40:54.360
Well, I could have promised at the time.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.360
Now looking back I do not know.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.360
You know how the mind plays tricks on you.

40:58.360 --> 41:07.360
You can create false memories in oneself but it looked to be that woman from the saloon who had gone missing.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.360
Kitty?

41:08.360 --> 41:10.360
Yes, that is the one.

41:10.360 --> 41:14.360
And then there was another girl that she was capturing.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.360
She was dressed strange.

41:16.360 --> 41:17.360
Like how?

41:17.360 --> 41:23.360
Just odd, vibrant colors, shoes made of different material.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.360
How old was she?

41:25.360 --> 41:29.360
She must have been a teenager of some sort.

41:29.360 --> 41:36.360
But this lasso that Miss Kitty was using to catch her, it was magic.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.360
What kind of magic are you talking about here?

41:38.360 --> 41:43.360
We all know that magic ain't real.

41:43.360 --> 41:47.360
I already hung the witches that were hanging around here.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.360
I disagreed with that decision personally.

41:49.360 --> 41:54.360
Not that I don't respect you, it's just that it didn't seem that they were actually witches.

41:54.360 --> 42:03.360
Anyway, I think that this lasso somehow, you know the lights in town, yes?

42:03.360 --> 42:04.360
Yeah.

42:04.360 --> 42:10.360
This power that moves through them seems to be moving through this lasso.

42:10.360 --> 42:14.360
Like some kind of electric lasso of some kind.

42:14.360 --> 42:21.360
Yes, it was filed to see and it burned her enough to make quite a smell.

42:21.360 --> 42:27.360
Horace, you think someone could handle an electric lasso that weren't hooked up to some big ol' power line?

42:27.360 --> 42:33.360
Glad to know Tildy B's doing okay here in the past.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.360
Yep.

42:34.360 --> 42:37.360
Horace Green, what are you doing during this time?

42:37.360 --> 42:40.360
It was Courtland's turn last time, what are you looking at?

42:40.360 --> 42:45.360
Horace is looking at a bug that has wandered into his frame of vision.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.360
What's it look like?

42:46.360 --> 42:50.360
It's a rather remarkable little beetle.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.360
Do you really want to know?

42:52.360 --> 42:53.360
I do, yeah.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.360
No, you don't.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.360
Alright, good turn. Jack Pearlman.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.360
I was taking Horace with me to go check out the cow.

43:05.360 --> 43:09.360
Yeah, and when you get over there you see that there is...

43:09.360 --> 43:11.360
You remember last night?

43:11.360 --> 43:14.360
Yeah, that's what I was assuming.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.360
I'd say it looks a whole lot like that.

43:16.360 --> 43:21.360
Jack Pearlman's eyes widen and he looks back at Horace.

43:21.360 --> 43:25.360
You ever seen something make marks like this on an animal before?

43:25.360 --> 43:29.360
There's a fucking hole in this cow, the size of a bowling ball.

43:29.360 --> 43:33.360
Around it there seems to be bite marks.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.360
Go ahead and roll biology if you got it.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.360
That is not an Old West skill.

43:37.360 --> 43:40.360
Go ahead and roll natural world I guess if you got it.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.360
Using that one a lot!

43:42.360 --> 43:43.360
Is there science?

43:43.360 --> 43:44.360
Five.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.360
Oh, there's science.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.360
Oh, either way you succeed on that roll

43:48.360 --> 43:51.360
as you see that these are bite marks

43:51.360 --> 43:53.360
roughly the size of a human jaw

43:53.360 --> 43:56.360
and roughly in the shape of a human mouth.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.360
Horace, I didn't want to...

43:58.360 --> 44:00.360
I didn't want to frighten nobody.

44:00.360 --> 44:04.360
Well, I hate to frighten you, Mr. Pearlman,

44:04.360 --> 44:07.360
but a man did this.

44:07.360 --> 44:11.360
Now both of you are all saying it again.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.360
Yeah, fail.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.360
Horace passes.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.360
Jack Pearlman, you just lose one sanity.

44:17.360 --> 44:20.360
This sinks in a little harder

44:20.360 --> 44:23.360
because this has already happened.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.360
Specifically, you've already seen these exact markings.

44:27.360 --> 44:31.360
Seeing it for a second time confirms what you saw last night.

44:31.360 --> 44:35.360
Horace, I didn't want to shock nobody at the town hall,

44:35.360 --> 44:39.360
but this, before I looked at it myself,

44:39.360 --> 44:43.360
but something similar to this happened to one of my horses last night

44:43.360 --> 44:45.360
and by God, Dandelion,

44:45.360 --> 44:48.360
it looked like she just got murdered and ate up

44:48.360 --> 44:51.360
by some kind of creature that in the distance,

44:51.360 --> 44:54.360
I thought my eyes was playing tricks on me,

44:54.360 --> 44:58.360
but you're telling me it's some kind of man that does this?

44:58.360 --> 45:01.360
Well, something with a jaw very much like that of a man.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.360
What kind of creature did you see?

45:03.360 --> 45:06.360
It was so far,

45:06.360 --> 45:09.360
it almost looked like some kind of person,

45:09.360 --> 45:14.360
but they were so far and they were moving ungodly fast, I'd say.

45:14.360 --> 45:17.360
I couldn't even catch up with them before they got into the woods

45:17.360 --> 45:19.360
and I was on horseback.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.360
And the wounds looked like this?

45:21.360 --> 45:23.360
Do you still have the body? I'd very much like to see it.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.360
Yeah, she's still on the barn.

45:26.360 --> 45:30.360
I put some dirt on her to keep her from the other horses, but...

45:30.360 --> 45:32.360
I'm sorry, she's on the barn?

45:32.360 --> 45:34.360
She's on top of the barn.

45:34.360 --> 45:36.360
How did you get her up there?

45:36.360 --> 45:37.360
Trebuchet.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.360
Jack Perlman is very strong.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.360
My God, what a specimen.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.360
Oh, thank you.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.360
Strong as a horse. Not that horse.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.360
You're an absolute mountain of a man.

45:46.360 --> 45:50.360
You make that sludge, Ephraim, look like a sludge.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.360
Oh.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.360
Got him.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.360
Certainly not a noble goo.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.360
But yeah, if you need to go take another look,

45:57.360 --> 46:01.360
but I'm telling you, it looks an awful lot exactly like this,

46:01.360 --> 46:04.360
and I'm assuming this happened to her last night also.

46:04.360 --> 46:09.360
Is there any other things I can perceive from this?

46:09.360 --> 46:11.360
Is there any tracks nearby?

46:11.360 --> 46:13.360
You could roll a tracking or...

46:13.360 --> 46:14.360
Is there a spot hidden?

46:14.360 --> 46:16.360
I think natural world would still work weirdly.

46:16.360 --> 46:19.360
I spot hidden in natural world.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.360
You gotta roll as well.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.360
I pass, 35 on a 40.

46:23.360 --> 46:27.360
You see footprints that are dug in right here on the ground,

46:27.360 --> 46:31.360
dug in hard, and they've left a mark.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.360
It's weird because shoes don't,

46:33.360 --> 46:37.360
typically the tread doesn't have a design on the bottom,

46:37.360 --> 46:41.360
but these have a three leaf design.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.360
It's like three leaves,

46:43.360 --> 46:49.360
and it's got three lines through the bottom of this trefoil,

46:49.360 --> 46:54.360
and under it, it says EST 1949.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.360
Go ahead and roll the sanity check.

46:57.360 --> 47:01.360
This is from the future.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.360
God damn it, I failed again.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.360
Would anybody make that assumption?

47:04.360 --> 47:06.360
It depends on if he fails the sanity check.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.360
I failed it.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.360
It's from the future.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.360
Go ahead and lose one sanity.

47:12.360 --> 47:15.360
Horace, do you see these here tracks?

47:15.360 --> 47:17.360
Let me just look at them.

47:17.360 --> 47:18.360
You're looking at them.

47:18.360 --> 47:23.360
Why do you think it says established in 1949,

47:23.360 --> 47:27.360
a year that does not exist as far as we know?

47:27.360 --> 47:30.360
Probably just the bottom part of the other eight wore off,

47:30.360 --> 47:33.360
and it's from 1849.

47:33.360 --> 47:35.360
Yeah, maybe you're right.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
Maybe.

47:36.360 --> 47:39.360
And Jack looks a little unsure of himself at this point.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.360
Jack, it's perfectly silly to assume otherwise.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.360
Yeah, you're probably right.

47:45.360 --> 47:50.360
I didn't sleep good last night after Dandelion's passing, but yeah.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.360
Yes, the body of your beloved horse.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.360
When can I see that?

47:53.360 --> 47:55.360
Cutting right back to Everett Pace.

47:55.360 --> 47:56.360
What are you up to?

47:56.360 --> 48:01.360
He's surveying the watermelon still and talking up to Greer.

48:01.360 --> 48:09.360
Miss Hilfentob-Germunkenau, you know that this isn't here a total loss.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.360
You can make a fine jelly out of any of this here.

48:11.360 --> 48:13.360
I can show you a little.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.360
Gathered up here.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.360
I mean, you can't be popping them with thighs no more, I guess,

48:18.360 --> 48:20.360
but it's still usable.

48:20.360 --> 48:23.360
I thought you were talking about the cow.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.360
Oh, God.

48:26.360 --> 48:29.360
You can make a fine jelly.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.360
Beef jelly.

48:31.360 --> 48:33.360
Well, that is, I mean, you melt down hooves.

48:33.360 --> 48:38.360
That is very kind of you to say.

48:38.360 --> 48:44.360
Go ahead and roll either psychology or persuade or charisma.

48:44.360 --> 48:48.360
I mean, I'll try to persuade us, I guess.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.360
It's just a 10.

48:51.360 --> 48:54.360
76, close.

48:54.360 --> 48:55.360
Yeah.

48:55.360 --> 49:02.360
Everett Pace, you are just as uncaring and otherworldly

49:02.360 --> 49:06.360
as they say that you are in town.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.360
I must be going now.

49:08.360 --> 49:12.360
And she goes into her home and slams the door shut.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.360
Well, if you're not going to use it, then I'm kind of.

49:14.360 --> 49:18.360
And he starts putting some watermelon in his pockets.

49:18.360 --> 49:25.360
Just goo-ing up his pockets with watermelon.

49:25.360 --> 49:29.360
And then he'll join the cow inspectors.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.360
As he is shoving watermelon goo into his pockets,

49:33.360 --> 49:38.360
Ephraim looks at him doing it and bends down and scoops up a little crushed up watermelon

49:38.360 --> 49:40.360
and eats it and kind of makes a funny face.

49:40.360 --> 49:44.360
And then he pulls his flask out and takes a couple gulps of it

49:44.360 --> 49:47.360
and then starts to pee on the side of the house.

49:47.360 --> 49:53.360
And after he's done, he follows Everett back to the cow.

49:53.360 --> 49:56.360
I hope you die a terrible, terrible death.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.360
Yeah, Horace Green walks up behind him and shoots him in the fucking head.

50:05.360 --> 50:08.360
It wasn't like a malicious pee, it was just he had to go

50:08.360 --> 50:11.360
and this was what was there.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.360
It wasn't a malicious pee.

50:14.360 --> 50:16.360
Wasn't malicious.

50:16.360 --> 50:20.360
Are you saying that Courtland has in his past?

50:20.360 --> 50:21.360
Yes.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.360
Oh, shit. Oh yeah, right?

50:23.360 --> 50:25.360
Delicious pees.

50:25.360 --> 50:29.360
I would imagine that like 60% of his pisses are malicious.

50:33.360 --> 50:37.360
Malicious and delicious because you know this guy's got diabetes for sure.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.360
That sweet pee.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.360
Sweet human oil.

50:44.360 --> 50:49.360
Does yours come out as oil and float on the top of your toilet water?

50:49.360 --> 50:53.360
Sign of a healthy kidney.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.360
Sometimes.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.360
It's like extra virgin olive oil.

51:01.360 --> 51:05.360
I've got to shake the toilet bowl up for it to be a uniform yellow.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.360
I regret.

51:10.360 --> 51:15.360
Yeah, Ephraim takes his sweet piss on the lady's house and walks back.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.360
Oh boy.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.360
What a foul man.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.360
As Everett's walking up on you guys.

51:20.360 --> 51:23.360
Boy, it sure sounds like Miss Kenny had herself a night.

51:23.360 --> 51:26.360
She was up here and then she was at the cemetery, she was up at my place.

51:26.360 --> 51:28.360
She's been running all around.

51:28.360 --> 51:34.360
And she dragged a woman with bizarre clothes around with an electric lasso.

51:34.360 --> 51:37.360
Sounds to me like we got two people stringing up now.

51:37.360 --> 51:46.360
Hey Everett, did you have anything that was living eviscerated on your property at all?

51:46.360 --> 51:48.360
Like this here cow.

51:48.360 --> 51:54.360
If you want to look at it, I wouldn't recommend it personally because it hurt my brain when I did.

51:54.360 --> 52:00.360
But you could look at it if you wanted to, but you could just trust me that it looks real bad.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.360
No, I don't reckon I did.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.360
I saw her out there and I run her off.

52:04.360 --> 52:08.360
Mr. Pace, you're absolutely sure you saw nothing last night?

52:08.360 --> 52:13.360
100%, I mean I saw Miss Kitty trying to dig up my wife, but no, nothing other than that.

52:13.360 --> 52:19.360
Okay, because I had one of my horses get real messed up, similar to this,

52:19.360 --> 52:24.360
and I just needed to know if it happened to you two, we could put something together maybe.

52:24.360 --> 52:26.360
Figure out what's going on.

52:26.360 --> 52:29.360
Ah, nothing. I think I just got there in time.

52:29.360 --> 52:31.360
Jack, which horse was it?

52:31.360 --> 52:33.360
It was Dandelion.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.360
Oh god damn.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.360
Beautiful, beautiful god damn horse.

52:36.360 --> 52:39.360
I always wanted Hamister and her to get something we could sell.

52:39.360 --> 52:42.360
That wasn't going to happen, but she was a beautiful horse.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.360
I miss Dandelion already.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.360
What do you think happened here?

52:46.360 --> 52:54.360
Horace told me that, Horace, why don't you tell them what your science tells you about what could have possibly happened here.

52:54.360 --> 53:06.360
Well, by the distance between the upper and lower parts of the bite, the dentation, the depth of the wound, all signs point to a human jaw.

53:06.360 --> 53:09.360
You think Miss Kitty did this?

53:09.360 --> 53:10.360
I don't know.

53:10.360 --> 53:14.360
Now it sounds like Miss Kitty was with someone else.

53:14.360 --> 53:21.360
Now do we know that maybe this someone or something else is the cause of all this?

53:21.360 --> 53:30.360
I mean, when she was over there digging up the grave over by my place, she was in a tizzy. She had a frenzy to her.

53:30.360 --> 53:37.360
Maybe she got bit. Maybe she got bit by a snake or something and rattled her up in there.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.360
Made her eat a cow?

53:39.360 --> 53:41.360
I've seen it do worse to worse.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.360
What?

53:43.360 --> 53:46.360
You've seen it do worse to worse?

53:47.360 --> 54:00.360
Horace, you ever heard of something like that? Some kind of disease that makes you go wild and be able to murder a horse and a cow in one evening and outrun another horse?

54:00.360 --> 54:06.360
Well, why certainly. All sorts of maladies affect man's mind and can drive them insane.

54:06.360 --> 54:11.360
Yeah, but I'm talking like speed and such and viciousness of the jaws.

54:11.360 --> 54:21.360
When the body becomes hyper excited, it has the power to ignore pains that might otherwise hobble it.

54:21.360 --> 54:30.360
And so under immense strengths, a man is capable of great feats of strength and speed.

54:30.360 --> 54:34.360
But I'm talking outrunning a goddamn horse here.

54:34.360 --> 54:40.360
Not like outrunning another person. I'm talking grade A, beautiful horses that I raised.

54:40.360 --> 54:47.360
Mr. Perlman, science would suggest that the most obvious answer is a slow horse.

54:47.360 --> 54:52.360
You talking about Jeremiah like that? Look at Jeremiah and you tell what you think about him.

54:52.360 --> 54:59.360
And when you look over at Jeremiah where he's tied up at the post at the entrance to the brick house,

54:59.360 --> 55:06.360
you see Preacher Sheriff Bobby Custard is across the road in between a couple houses

55:06.360 --> 55:15.360
and he's looking off at a trail that leads in the southeasterly direction out of town.

55:15.360 --> 55:20.360
And he comes walking back with his head slunk down.

55:20.360 --> 55:24.360
None of y'all had tracking, is that right? None of y'all is getting good at tracking?

55:24.360 --> 55:28.360
I think it was established that you are quite the trackster.

55:28.360 --> 55:35.360
Yep, so I went ahead and took care of it for you and turns out it seems like one person

55:35.360 --> 55:43.360
dragged some body, I guess, through this way, threw him on top of a horse

55:43.360 --> 55:47.360
and the horse, it just trotted on right off.

55:47.360 --> 55:52.360
Going about, you know, pretty quick pace, quick clip, heading on down this path here

55:52.360 --> 55:55.360
and this path only leads to one place.

55:55.360 --> 55:56.360
Yeah, that's handy.

55:56.360 --> 56:05.360
And you all know that it leads to the southeast part of town, which is where the new mine resides

56:05.360 --> 56:13.360
and it also happens to be the property on which Silas and Mary Cole live.

56:13.360 --> 56:17.360
I haven't been here long, but if I'm not mistaken, it leads straight to the coal land.

56:17.360 --> 56:20.360
It does indeed, over there by the mine. That's right.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.360
I'm sure he had something to do with this.

56:22.360 --> 56:31.360
Yeah, I've always felt uneasy about him and this is making me feel uneasy, so he's probably up to something, right?

56:31.360 --> 56:38.360
Custer, can we get on in there? It's legal, right, for sheriffs to do that if there's things to look at and such?

56:38.360 --> 56:44.360
Well, we can certainly go just ask him questions. We just need to follow these railroad tracks here straight to the mine.

56:44.360 --> 56:49.360
We could go under the pretense of me asking about my copper wire.

56:49.360 --> 56:52.360
I mean, you are a judge. You can sign a warrant.

56:52.360 --> 57:00.360
If there's two people in this town that could walk into any property here in contention, I'd say they're sitting on these fine horses right here.

57:00.360 --> 57:05.360
It's the judge and the sheriff and, you know, also the priest is here as well.

57:05.360 --> 57:07.360
I'm also the doctor.

57:07.360 --> 57:08.360
Oh, no.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.360
Is he good at any of them?

57:12.360 --> 57:13.360
Nope.

57:16.360 --> 57:18.360
I bet he gives a decent service.

57:18.360 --> 57:19.360
Forty percent.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.360
In preaching.

57:48.360 --> 57:49.360
Get my daughter.

57:58.360 --> 58:06.360
