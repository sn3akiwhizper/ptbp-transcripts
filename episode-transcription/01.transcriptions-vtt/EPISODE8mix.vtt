01:50.240 --> 01:58.240
to be read by your local canine dj wolf the dog damn y'all i just can't stop thinking about how

01:58.240 --> 02:05.600
that girl disappeared out of thin air but you know who's not disappearing anytime soon it's kudzu with

02:05.600 --> 02:17.920
no backbone

02:36.240 --> 02:43.920
so

02:45.600 --> 02:50.720
i think tilde might be wrapped up in some some weird stuff that's been going around in town

02:50.720 --> 02:57.920
can you give her a call uh mildred uh pulls out her phone and calls and you hear a

02:57.920 --> 03:00.240
um

03:04.000 --> 03:07.920
coming from upstairs uh john you would you would hear it like in the same room as you

03:07.920 --> 03:16.240
there's some kind of huge bee in this room uh i what kind of phone does she have iphone

03:17.360 --> 03:23.760
full stop all right is it locked yeah does she have any pictures of herself in the room

03:23.760 --> 03:28.880
yeah all right i try to unlock it with a picture of her uh yeah you can unlock it hell yeah

03:28.880 --> 03:34.560
um hey i hey i just answer and i'm like whoa she looks at keith and she's like

03:35.200 --> 03:40.560
oh she answered she's right upstairs no mildred it's me it's john lee peter pennymore

03:41.680 --> 03:43.840
i can't keep revealing my terrible secret

03:43.840 --> 03:56.640
so she's gone i'm sorry to say mildred it seems like she is when will she be back we don't

03:57.280 --> 04:04.480
rightly know i think around now is when clark starts to regain some of his faculties and he

04:05.040 --> 04:10.640
goes over to mildred and said uh mildred uh yeah i don't i don't know where she went but you know

04:10.720 --> 04:14.320
we're gonna find her we always find people we're looking for do you find john peters

04:15.360 --> 04:18.640
that was yesterday we're working on it we actually are coming pretty close we think

04:19.680 --> 04:28.480
uh she like reaches over to her ashtray relights that spliff and starts walking upstairs uh so in

04:28.480 --> 04:33.600
until this room i want to do a couple things a has the camera reacted to being in here at all no

04:33.600 --> 04:38.800
okay uh now that i've unlocked her phone i want to check her texts her facebook like messenger

04:38.800 --> 04:43.440
anything i want to look at her communication see who she's talking to you know is she in a

04:43.440 --> 04:48.480
facebook messenger group called like freaky death cult uh yeah she's in a freaky death cult no

04:48.480 --> 04:51.280
basically what you would garner is that

04:54.960 --> 04:58.400
i'm sorry there's so much tube technology

04:58.400 --> 05:02.000
in this world

05:07.600 --> 05:12.880
she was a pretty standoffish kid from what you can tell she clearly grew up maybe not clearly but she

05:12.880 --> 05:18.880
grew up in this house with her grandma her parents are gone she's had a weird home life uh her

05:18.880 --> 05:26.160
grandma raised her but was always stoned you would gather from her phone that she probably has uh

05:26.160 --> 05:33.920
dabbled in in smoking some pot herself and uh you know normal kid stuff she's into tv shows and

05:33.920 --> 05:40.640
you know movies and music and other things that people find uh enjoyable as hobbies looking

05:40.640 --> 05:45.840
through her phone she seems like your typical teenager i don't know how she came across like

05:45.840 --> 05:51.760
watching tv shows and movies and your typical enjoyable things yeah the kind of things that

05:51.760 --> 05:55.040
people like wow how old a girl is she uh

05:59.200 --> 06:03.040
mildred is sitting on her bed i feel like we were asking you and not mildred yeah

06:03.840 --> 06:10.640
oh i definitely we saw her uh early high school freshman or sophomore probably cool probably

06:10.640 --> 06:16.800
sophomore actually we'll go with sophomore she has a car hell yeah so she's pretty cool she's pretty

06:16.800 --> 06:21.760
cool i'll do cash till he has a driver's license we should grab that we should grab that gun

06:22.640 --> 06:27.920
before we forget okay so it seems like a troubled teen uh sneaking around her neighbor's abandoned

06:27.920 --> 06:34.160
house find some spooky shit but i do you think she knew she would disappear or was she trying

06:34.160 --> 06:38.720
to harm you she pointed it at you that's what i'm trying to say is i don't think she knew what this

06:38.720 --> 06:43.680
was so she was gonna shoot me for entering her room she was gonna kill me somebody might have

06:43.680 --> 06:49.840
gotten to her about having those things somebody besides julie maxwell purchased other items maybe

06:49.840 --> 06:54.560
we should go back and find out who purchased those other items if there's a security footage

06:54.560 --> 06:59.200
or anything like that if she said it was in the past week or so they might still have some that's

06:59.200 --> 07:03.360
not a bad idea keith see if we can find some people snooping around that booth we've just

07:03.360 --> 07:07.840
entered the room of like the mastermind of all of this and we're like she's a poor teeny and you're

07:07.840 --> 07:18.240
like you'll never catch me alive did clark not mention that she said she twirled her mustache

07:20.080 --> 07:25.120
it all happened real quick but she looks scared as all get out pointing that gun at me was it the

07:25.120 --> 07:30.320
fear of a little girl about to shoot a police officer or a fear of a girl about to do something

07:30.320 --> 07:37.360
metaphysical i think i think we i think we probably got both but i i would suspect that

07:37.360 --> 07:40.880
she learned some things about what she had in her possession i think we should go back

07:40.880 --> 07:45.120
to the metaphysical store hidden treasures forgotten treasures

07:47.360 --> 07:53.520
i know they're closed but not for us uh they are closed but you see the same woman inside

07:53.520 --> 07:56.960
she's like sweeping up give her a friendly way from outside and point to the door

07:57.680 --> 08:04.160
i'm sorry um we're closed oh yeah man we're not here to shop we had some more questions related

08:04.160 --> 08:11.280
to uh booth 504 oh oh okay i i guess come on in thank you man what what can i what can i assist

08:11.280 --> 08:18.080
you with officers we were specifically wondering if you had any more records uh or receipts from

08:18.080 --> 08:24.240
that booth you see that big book that she was going through and uh she looks at it walks over

08:24.320 --> 08:28.560
and starts flipping through it well second question do you have any security cameras in here

08:30.880 --> 08:37.760
yeah but they don't rightly work with they're mostly just the show the kids

08:37.760 --> 08:45.840
yeah yeah and oh hey i want to come through on that roll it up uh 96 can i human her too

08:45.840 --> 08:52.320
yeah let's not so um so yeah you you believe what you want to believe the truth is out there zack

08:52.320 --> 08:58.400
and this old lady is a lying two-faced fuck she does have a face on the back of her head

09:02.720 --> 09:07.520
as she's flipping through the through the big book gosh uh there were three items recently

09:07.520 --> 09:14.640
bought from booth 504 there was a camera that was bought with a check and uh that was from

09:14.640 --> 09:22.240
and she's done through julie julie maxwell another item was uh put on uh the tab uh by

09:23.120 --> 09:28.880
marie jacobs marie marie has a tab uh yeah she come in here pretty often i'd say so what sort

09:28.880 --> 09:34.640
of things does she usually buy well what was that item on the tab it's a radio yeah it says a radio

09:34.640 --> 09:43.920
and then uh there was another item uh uh a helmet that was uh it was put on a credit card you have

09:43.920 --> 09:48.880
a name on that card man it's uh the first church of contention this might be a strange question do

09:48.880 --> 09:57.520
you remember all of these items being tubed um i didn't sell all of them i don't rightly remember

09:57.520 --> 10:02.000
that's fine do you remember who from the church purchased that helmet i i wasn't here for that

10:02.000 --> 10:06.880
but who would be purchasing things on the who has a credit card to the church do you think do you

10:06.880 --> 10:12.560
know clark who would have that you religious clark probably not i don't think john lee is

10:12.560 --> 10:17.280
but i think he definitely would have spent time around a church growing up what is the first

10:17.280 --> 10:22.160
church of contention baptist Scientologist it's uh we're not it's just the first church of

10:22.160 --> 10:26.880
contention we're not gonna call it one denomination is more evil than the other they're all pretty

10:26.880 --> 10:32.000
equally dog methodists are all right methodists don't give a fuck they're chill

10:35.120 --> 10:39.040

10:39.040 --> 10:43.200

contention do you know anything about that helmet is it a bike helmet it just says helmet okay did

11:02.560 --> 11:08.560

11:08.560 --> 11:19.600

11:19.600 --> 11:24.320

behind the white toyota and john lee pettymore you are taking up the rear right behind clark bishop

18:04.720 --> 18:12.160
as you are driving there's an intersection approaching and the white toyota is going

18:12.160 --> 18:17.120
to drive straight through the red light clark what do you do real fast my assessment of the

18:17.120 --> 18:24.320
situation can i see if is there more than one person in the car roll me in a search

18:24.320 --> 18:38.080
fail 61 i also wonder that i pass a 34 on a 40 uh keith you see there is one person in the driver's

18:38.080 --> 18:43.920
seat of the white toyota cool clark how are you handling the situation from a driving perspective

18:44.800 --> 18:51.680
there is traffic going horizontally i do it like a ambulance would so lights on siren on and just

18:51.680 --> 18:55.840
cautiously but still trying to maintain as much speed as i can but still seeing how safe i can be

18:55.840 --> 19:00.000
about the oncoming traffic if i'm if they're stopping i'm going but if they're don't look

19:00.000 --> 19:06.240
like they're stopping i'm not going through okay yeah he is going to go through the intersection

19:06.240 --> 19:12.160
and john lee pettymart full speed i peel around him and i'm not really looking okay i need you

19:12.160 --> 19:21.520
both to roll another drive check for me fail on mine if i roll 70 on a 70 is that a fail no that

19:21.520 --> 19:28.320
is a great success okay cool it's a really really quite good success very lucky the white toyota

19:28.320 --> 19:37.120
swerves out of the way of the traffic as he goes through the intersection nimbly dodging a car

19:37.120 --> 19:44.240
clark bishop you are about to hit a car coming in from the right too hot didn't see your sirens

19:44.240 --> 19:50.560
didn't uh didn't hear you so you have to like hit the brakes yeah in order to uh avoid a collision

19:50.560 --> 19:57.040
there as john lee petty more just like slides like through the intersection and flies through

19:57.040 --> 20:02.000
it on the tail of the white toyota keith what do you want to do i'm gonna flash my gun at the

20:02.000 --> 20:10.640
person that almost just hit us and point out and then i nod my head and i go yeah yeah then i say

20:10.640 --> 20:18.240
hit it i do okay so now the pursuit is still heading north on that same road the white toyota

20:18.240 --> 20:28.400
is going like 60 65 miles an hour on a 45 and gaining speed john lee petty morn it is up to you

20:28.400 --> 20:33.920
what you want to do next i'm just still in hot pursuit you're basically right behind this white

20:33.920 --> 20:40.800
toyota so what maneuvers are you going to take i assume my police cruiser has more power so i'm

20:40.800 --> 20:45.200
just going to try to get ahead of him and make him stop or run off the road how close is he to

20:45.200 --> 20:51.200
the white toyota how close are we to the white toyota i would say john lee petty more is roughly

20:51.200 --> 20:56.720
10 yards 15 yards behind the white toyota and you guys are 20 yards behind his cruiser you

20:56.720 --> 21:01.120
can just call him a channel okay i see that john has the lead on this one so i'm whatever he does

21:01.120 --> 21:04.880
even if he does manage to get to the side or around it i'm gonna still kind of be taking up

21:04.880 --> 21:09.680
the rear in case that car goes off i think we should try to get up close too because i can get

21:09.680 --> 21:14.480
the shotgun out of the back and try to take out his tires okay because i got pretty good firearms

21:14.480 --> 21:17.680
okay i'll do that i'll get a little closer if you can pull up to the side i'll try to get up

21:17.680 --> 21:24.960
to the back and i'll be like cop loudspeaker just like pull over stop the vehicle okay six so i'm

21:24.960 --> 21:39.120
going to roll okay so here's what happens john as you pull behind this uh this white toyota you see

21:39.120 --> 21:46.080
a hand go out the driver's side window with a something that is on fire in the hand and he

21:46.080 --> 21:53.200
throws a bottle molotov cocktail awesome and it is flying through the air i need you to

21:53.760 --> 22:00.320
roll against his throw on a drive check in order to avoid the molotov cocktail heading straight

22:00.320 --> 22:10.160
for your windshield five as you swerve you manage to avoid the cocktail hitting your windshield

22:10.160 --> 22:17.600
exactly but it does catch the the back corner of your car and and you're not sure whether or not

22:17.600 --> 22:25.040
a fire has started or whether or not just the exterior of your car is on fire currently clark

22:25.040 --> 22:34.080
you and keith see a small explosion in the back right of john's car and glass seems to just

22:34.080 --> 22:40.160
shatter off in in that direction as you guys are pulling up closer this is the most alive

22:40.160 --> 22:45.920
john has felt since his racing days holy shit did that guy just throw a molotov cocktail

22:45.920 --> 22:50.000
i think he did dude we gotta take this guy out i already have reached back and picked up the

22:50.000 --> 22:53.680
shotgun and i'm waiting to roll my window down until we can get close enough to him because i

22:53.680 --> 22:59.760
don't want no fire in this car okay i think he had to slow down enough and john clearly like

22:59.760 --> 23:05.040
swerved to the left and you guys pulled up right next to him so the two of you are side by side

23:05.040 --> 23:10.240
with the white toyota right in between you right ahead of you clark is there anything you want to

23:10.240 --> 23:15.120
do maneuver wise while you're driving or are you just trying to i mean always getting closer into

23:15.120 --> 23:22.560
maybe his right side there's a passenger side now okay awesome so let's go ahead and do another

23:22.560 --> 23:31.840
drive roll off all both of you and i'll roll for for the white toyota as well fuck 89 on a 50 90

23:31.840 --> 23:39.360
on a 70 okay the white toyota failed his check as well so you're still in the same positions moving

23:39.360 --> 23:45.440
forward but you are heading directly for a t so there's no straight there's only right or left

23:45.440 --> 23:53.360
coming up and the white toyota is going to whip it to the right so as you guys hit this turn

23:53.360 --> 23:57.920
let's do one more check to see if anything changes if he's with jostling and i was already on the

23:57.920 --> 24:02.320
right can i try and t-bone him or i don't know if it'd be a t-bone but maybe like half pit maneuver

24:02.320 --> 24:07.120
to hit his back side to get him spinning yeah absolutely i want to try to shoot out his front

24:07.120 --> 24:11.600
right tire as well okay and how are you doing that hanging out the passenger seat with the

24:11.600 --> 24:25.840
shotgun and just awesome okay so let's get those drive rolls a two on a 50 nice 63 on a 70 63 and

24:25.840 --> 24:29.840
what are you trying to do i guess as we come up to that t and i see him turning right i'm just

24:29.840 --> 24:35.280
going to try to do some late braking and pass him on the turn basically awesome roll the firearms

24:35.520 --> 24:41.360
please keith 21 on a 70 awesome and you were aiming for a tire front right tire yeah as he

24:41.360 --> 24:48.640
takes this right turn clark you try to fishtail him you make connection however he turns into it

24:48.640 --> 24:57.200
and begins to avoid the fishtail maneuver however keith vigna blows his front right tire as he's

24:57.200 --> 25:04.160
doing so which would pull him harder right hard right yeah so that is going to complete the fish

25:04.160 --> 25:09.280
tail and make that a success and john you can yeah has i mean has this pretty much brought him

25:09.280 --> 25:14.320
to a stop uh he's gonna be sideways here in a second yeah and probably just like right in the

25:14.320 --> 25:20.640
middle of the street okay once we stop i'm gonna jump out have my shotgun trained on him and stand

25:20.640 --> 25:25.760
there until you guys can move to get him out because i'm not trying to pop around so john

25:25.760 --> 25:30.560
what are you doing where's your car going i'll just go around to the rear of his car since you

25:30.560 --> 25:34.160
guys are in a position to go like to block him from the front we can just get them blocked in

25:34.160 --> 25:40.320
basically yeah are are you picturing our car i'm picturing me my car and his car parallel facing

25:40.320 --> 25:44.720
opposite directions oh okay i was picturing you okay then i'll get in front of him yeah and you

25:44.720 --> 25:49.360
guys get behind him or whatever yeah that's good so i've got shotgun trained as soon as you get out

25:49.360 --> 25:56.240
of the car you've got a shotgun in your hands and he is going to begin firing at you okay are you

25:56.320 --> 26:02.480
going to attempt to take cover or fire back so if i was coming up to his passenger side i'm gonna

26:02.480 --> 26:07.440
jump towards the back of his car so that he doesn't have a good aim on me and try to like get

26:07.440 --> 26:12.400
by the trunk of his car and kind of take cover and try to i want to get a good shot on him but i'm not

26:12.400 --> 26:16.320
i don't want to like shoot at him yet i don't want to try to kill him but i want to get at a good

26:16.320 --> 26:22.000
angle where he can't hit me but i could if i had to get him absolutely so he he fires a few shots

26:22.000 --> 26:26.880
breaks out the glass of his uh the on the passenger side of the white toyota and then

26:26.880 --> 26:31.760
in the passenger backseat side he shoots out that glass too as he's trying to get at you

26:31.760 --> 26:37.920
i believe that would make it john's turn john tries to remember his training like officers

26:37.920 --> 26:44.480
are under fire so cops would just be like wasting this dude for sure yeah but but we we need him

26:44.480 --> 26:50.800
yeah that's why i didn't just immediately blow his fucking head off can we uh can we tell from

26:50.800 --> 26:55.280
the shots or see what kind of gun he's using is it just a pistol it's a pistol yeah so how many

26:55.280 --> 27:02.000
shots has he fired off at this point four couple i'll pop out of my cruiser and keep talking to him

27:02.000 --> 27:09.280
through the intercom put down your weapon we just want to talk maybe you know about this goo can i

27:09.280 --> 27:14.080
from my angle see if i know this guy have i seen him before i know that this is charles's car

27:14.080 --> 27:19.040
do it can i tell it's charles yeah okay it looks like charles i'm gonna be on my intercom using

27:19.040 --> 27:28.880
his name charles come on settle come on what was that voice come on hey hey charles big

27:28.880 --> 27:32.880
old thing of helium right before charles stop shooting at him stop shooting at him

27:34.800 --> 27:39.440
all right t what do you do okay i want to try to get around to the like passenger side of the

27:39.440 --> 27:45.520
trunk and see is he still in inside of his car yeah with all the doors closed yeah if i like

27:45.520 --> 27:50.640
pop up pop up over the trunk and look and see inside of his car through the back window is his

27:50.640 --> 27:55.760
arm still out like trying to shoot or like what can i see looking inside i mean yeah he's in the

27:55.760 --> 28:01.600
front he's in the driver's seat he is looking your direction he's kind of looking all around

28:01.600 --> 28:08.080
but he just fired back through there and so he's panicky how would you feel if i was him bad

28:08.080 --> 28:12.000
probably probably not good probably like a shouldn't have broken the law

28:12.000 --> 28:18.880
um can i try to like open up the well shit that's stupid what do you do no that's what do you do i

28:19.920 --> 28:24.720
fire off a warning shot of the shotgun to where maybe like a couple pellets hit like the side of

28:24.720 --> 28:32.480
his ear or his head the rest just go like like a like a like a but not right at him okay so

28:32.480 --> 28:39.680
you're firing away from him into the car yeah but you're not firing across his face bow i'm

28:39.680 --> 28:46.080
not trying to like shoot directly into his head okay but like if a little spray gets on him

28:47.200 --> 28:51.040
okay roll firearms for me i fail

28:55.760 --> 28:58.880
and you had a shotgun so go ahead and

28:58.880 --> 29:11.360
uh let's see is that essentially a called shot like yeah like near it like not trying to hit

29:11.360 --> 29:16.800
someone is just as hard as hitting someone exactly where you want to also i am thinking this is like

29:16.800 --> 29:23.040
buckshot not like a slug yeah yeah he just wanted to grace his face right with a couple pellets not

29:23.040 --> 29:30.320
all the pain refreshing spray mist of pellets yeah wake him up a little bit it's so good

29:30.880 --> 29:33.200
yeah so go ahead and roll 2d6 for me

29:39.920 --> 29:41.680
shit okay um

29:45.600 --> 29:52.240
so you uh you blast into this car you were trying to shoot to the right of him

29:52.240 --> 29:58.000
but you really you just fired directly into the back of his seat there is a mist of red

29:59.840 --> 30:08.640
going all over the front of the car as the horn begins to blare and the slumped body of charles

30:08.640 --> 30:15.120
is leaning directly into the steering wheel his face making the horn incessant

30:15.120 --> 30:22.880
john lee pettimore lets off a couple of panic shots towards the van when he sees all that

30:22.880 --> 30:29.440

30:29.440 --> 30:40.080

30:40.080 --> 30:46.400
pop of a tire as you shoot out clark's front right tire on his cruiser sorry clark i'm taking cover

30:48.240 --> 30:52.080
ricochets are going on as you take cover i think you saw

30:52.080 --> 30:56.880

32:07.280 --> 32:15.680
right into the cavity that one of his chest as you put your fingers around his still beating

32:16.400 --> 32:19.760
i got you buddy and i manually beat his heart for him

32:26.400 --> 32:33.440

32:33.440 --> 32:40.320
where you are you think you you know your way around a wrist or a neck however no pulse is

32:40.320 --> 32:45.280
being felt by you as i as i'm looking for the pulse i'm using my radio to call in an ambulance

33:28.480 --> 33:34.640
all together that'd be interesting let's start it now or a fucking nightmare oh for sure you'd

33:34.640 --> 33:41.760
have to be real intimate with all of them that'd be wild though i'm i'm barely i'm barely intimate

33:41.760 --> 33:47.920
with this one so okay well yeah i pop up out of the side kill the guy boys he's he's dead

33:47.920 --> 33:53.360
he's he's real dead ah fucking i hate paperwork can we cover this up maybe just make it look like

33:53.360 --> 33:58.720
a road accident or something let's search his car yeah i want to search him to pat him down

33:58.720 --> 34:04.800
check his pockets in the middle of the street a crowd begins to gather around you all i fire a

34:04.800 --> 34:10.240
couple more shots into the air and tell them to disperse roll firearms what are we around up up

34:10.240 --> 34:16.160
here 59 on a 60 how big of a crowd are we talking here it's not there's like like three hundreds of

34:16.160 --> 34:21.280
people gathered there's like four people who stopped what they're doing to watch and a couple

34:21.280 --> 34:26.320
cars like two cars have pulled over and they're just sitting there staring phones out do they

34:26.320 --> 34:32.160
take off when i shoot in the air do you actually shoot yeah oh then yeah they leave okay uh-huh

34:32.880 --> 34:37.440
one of the people just gets into somebody else's car and they they're nice enough to take them out

34:37.440 --> 34:42.320
of this scary situation that's how you maintain law and order i cast obliviate on them so they

34:42.320 --> 34:48.400
forget what they just saw harry potter universe canon now okay so as you guys are looking through

34:48.400 --> 34:53.360
this car you see there's a there's a handgun in his hand in the seat next to him there's a

34:53.360 --> 34:59.440
different handgun does it have any crazy um features no they both look relatively normal

34:59.440 --> 35:06.160
handguns uh there's also a mag light sitting in the shotgun seat and in the back seat there's a

35:06.720 --> 35:13.120
rifle a burner phone a wallet and some keys all in the back seat all in the back seat i want to

35:13.120 --> 35:16.880
look at that burner phone too what numbers are stored in there i'm gonna grab the wallet as you

35:16.880 --> 35:22.240
look through the burner phone everything has been deleted off of it there's literally no information

35:22.240 --> 35:29.280
on it whatsoever and as you open up the wallet there's an army id for a billy harrison he's a

35:29.280 --> 35:35.280
pretty nondescript dude pretty young he doesn't look like charles he's bald no it's not charles

35:35.280 --> 35:42.080
pretty fit dude bald guy young guy probably in his uh late 20s early 30s wouldn't it say on the id

35:42.080 --> 35:51.200
he's got shut up he's got pretty intense eyes he is 29. anything uh interesting about the keys

35:51.200 --> 35:57.920
particularly if they have a storage unit it's a key ring with one car key on it does it seem like

35:57.920 --> 36:03.520
this toyota was his can i check the glove box the keys to the toyota are still in the toyota

36:03.520 --> 36:09.680
what is in the glove box there is almost nothing in the glove box there's like the manual for the

36:09.680 --> 36:15.680
there's not like any interest no there's no registration on the one key on the one key ring

36:15.680 --> 36:22.400
is there a make of the car did we check the trunk yet did we check the trunk yet it's a van right

36:22.400 --> 36:28.160
are we checking trunk yet an suv what is it toyota toyota i think i was picturing a white carola

36:28.160 --> 36:32.000
for some reason i was picturing like a tundra i actually just pictured us chasing a ford bronco

36:32.000 --> 36:38.080
this whole time if i did it by charles the guy just killed him we'll say dodge why not dodge

36:38.080 --> 36:43.120
how about dodge on the key ring john lee pettymore i want to check the trunk too since i'm already

36:43.120 --> 36:52.400
back here okay so as you pop open the trunk there is a man is completely unconscious is it billy

36:52.400 --> 37:00.720
harrison he looks exactly like billy harrison he is alive though yeah he's unconscious he's

37:00.720 --> 37:08.640
unconscious and he is wearing a black t-shirt and jeans is there anything else yeah underneath him

37:08.640 --> 37:16.400
also in the trunk is a police uniform a set of scrubs and a black suit this guy likes costume

37:16.400 --> 37:21.600
parties can i try to wake him up is he tied up or is he just stuck back there conscious his hands

37:21.600 --> 37:30.160
are bound with a chain spooky uh i want to try to wake him up shake him shake him up clark as you

37:30.160 --> 37:38.800
are going over charles he has id on him named charles donovan he is from the city he's got a

37:38.800 --> 37:47.680
burner phone on him and he has a piece of paper two addresses on the piece of paper you recognize

37:47.680 --> 37:54.640
them both immediately one is john peter's house and the other is the piston pig farm

37:55.360 --> 38:03.120
the keys that are in the ignition of the white toyota include a key to a room at the motel my

38:03.120 --> 38:08.800
motel the one that keith vigna is staying at and there is a key fob for dirty dog grooming

38:09.360 --> 38:16.960
charles donovan also has scratches all over his arms legs and face do they look like

38:16.960 --> 38:24.000
scratches from a dog or a human those are the only two or like brushes brush if he was running

38:24.080 --> 38:29.600
oh yeah are they claw marks i think that would be easy they're not claw marks okay i like what

38:29.600 --> 38:35.520
you're thinking uh but no yeah his skin is definitely uh red and irritable looking as if

38:35.520 --> 38:40.720
it has been scratched repeatedly in multiple places but not not breaking the skin like

38:40.720 --> 38:47.680
they're not wounds a couple seem to have bled but mostly not and no discernible pattern no so

38:47.680 --> 38:53.680
it doesn't look like he got scratched up by brush or something not really okay no well now what

38:54.000 --> 38:57.440
there's a lot we could do actually uh let me look at the burner phone in his pocket

38:57.440 --> 39:01.440
there is nothing on it yeah no it's it's wiped clean

39:03.520 --> 39:07.760
shit not even like a recent calls list what was the last selfie he took

39:09.600 --> 39:14.320
holding the molotov you should show it to his family no he wouldn't have any recent calls

39:14.320 --> 39:21.360
there he would have deleted him by now keith you are slapping this bald man

39:21.360 --> 39:28.480
in the back of the trunk and he's not waking up your slapping is not helping guys look what i

39:28.480 --> 39:35.440
found who i found could we do a search rule to like more intensely search the vehicle sure

39:36.400 --> 39:45.840
one holy shit 13 on a 20 i get it also not as good as him okay he starts the fuck out of this

39:45.840 --> 39:51.280
car though maybe a tantalizing piece of information that might have escaped his lips before his chest

39:51.280 --> 40:01.280
was exploded john as you are looking over the stuff you decide to pull out dump them all on the

40:01.280 --> 40:08.160
ground yeah you dump it all out in the middle of the road the police uniform that he has matches

40:08.160 --> 40:15.840
the police uniform that the three of you wear here in contention okay and he has a badge on there

40:15.840 --> 40:22.800
a real badge you would know that it's not but it looks and no other identification like it says

40:22.800 --> 40:29.840
officer kissel is it a contention badge yeah is it pretty good yeah no this is like a pretty good

40:29.840 --> 40:40.560
fake the set of scrubs has an id that says dr zebrowski and the black suit inside one of the

40:40.560 --> 40:48.160
pockets has fbi credentials for an agent parks does the do the scrubs have a name of a hospital

40:48.160 --> 40:54.880
on them no good question what do we have in contention just like a clinic correct and then

40:54.880 --> 41:01.280
the city has a hospital oh also with your search role sorry because you critically succeeded

41:01.280 --> 41:07.840
as you're looking over charles's body helping clark discern the scratches that are all over him

41:07.840 --> 41:18.240
you see that the scratches are in the pattern of of hands and it looks like a human human's hands

41:19.280 --> 41:25.520
made all these scratches all over charles okay so i guess i would like to get drew looking up

41:25.520 --> 41:30.720
all these credentials to see if there actually is a dr zebrowski somewhere in state following up on

41:30.720 --> 41:37.040
the fbi credentials for agent parks see if that's a real person and then uh john is gonna go over

41:37.040 --> 41:43.600
and start changing the tire on clark's cruiser nice it feels bad about that the ambulance arrives

41:43.600 --> 41:48.160
on the scene before they get to either body i'm gonna have them take a look at my foot

41:50.640 --> 41:54.640
you got anything for this yeah does this count as a hospital visit

41:56.160 --> 41:58.240
can you roll to get some foot hit points back

41:58.240 --> 42:09.840
yeah i like that go ahead and roll d4 or that's a d6

42:14.720 --> 42:20.640
that's what you get uh they throw a band-aid at you now they um they have a splint with them that

42:20.640 --> 42:25.600
you can throw on and it'll make walking much easier charles is dead so i'd like to direct

42:25.600 --> 42:34.160
them to um trying to wake up billy yeah they attempt to bring billy harrison to consciousness

42:34.160 --> 42:41.120
and do not succeed and immediately they're like we got to get him help they throw him on a stretcher

42:41.120 --> 42:45.280
and put him in the back of the ambulance i'm gonna go with him in the ambulance just in case

42:45.280 --> 42:51.360
he's a bad guy or if he's a good guy i can ask him too perfect i grab keith don't kill this one man

42:51.360 --> 43:00.560
i'm not a murderer not this one uh keith go ahead and roll sanity for me real quick for murdering

43:01.840 --> 43:05.600
charles 18 on a 40 nice

43:08.720 --> 43:13.280
justified police action in the line of duty i mean this is is this the first time i've

43:13.280 --> 43:17.440
killed someone i would think so i think yeah this is my first murder by cop how many people

43:17.440 --> 43:21.440
have we killed in this podcast so far you killed one i killed you and i've killed one

43:21.440 --> 43:24.320
and you haven't killed anybody yet pussy that's surprising yeah

43:26.800 --> 43:33.040
all right so keith hops in the ambulance as it goes away a little notepad out of my back pocket

43:33.040 --> 43:38.400
make a tick mark and shut it back yes he's pulling away keep keep him
