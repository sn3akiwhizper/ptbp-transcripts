00:00.000 --> 00:06.580
Skip a bop, a skibbity bop, a wee dee dee dee dee dee, a skip skibbity skip skip, it's

00:06.580 --> 00:15.760
Scatman Wolf, y'all, hittin' you from bleeba deeba 694.2 PTBP, my jazzy babies, and I am

00:15.760 --> 00:21.800
hittin' you live from the past and the present, and maybe even the future.

00:21.800 --> 00:26.060
Time is weird, time is like jazz.

00:26.060 --> 00:30.260
It's all made up, and no one fuckin' understands it.

00:30.260 --> 00:35.140
Speaking of things I don't understand and I'm forced to do, this week's Howlin'

00:35.140 --> 00:40.360
with Wolf is from Brittany Roxanne, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
pod.

00:41.360 --> 00:48.020
Seriously, what a pleasant thing to do, they write, I have an urgent message for Hurt Ork.

00:48.020 --> 00:54.860
Your message is simple, infiltrate the enemy, gather intel, and report back what you find.

00:54.860 --> 01:01.180
If your cover's blown, do not, under any circumstances, contact us.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.060
Good luck, Agent.

01:03.060 --> 01:10.540
Uh, this seems like a weird avenue to deliver super secret urgent messages to people.

01:10.540 --> 01:18.140
I hope Hurt Ork accomplishes whatever the mission was, unless that mission is to infiltrate

01:18.140 --> 01:23.060
my home and gather intel on little ol' me?

01:23.260 --> 01:28.940
Hey, producer, beef up the security around here, you salty salt dog.

01:28.940 --> 01:33.180
If you see some Ork who was hurt, you know what to do.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.740
Hey, do you like this show?

01:35.740 --> 01:37.580
Do you wanna help this show?

01:37.580 --> 01:39.580
Do you even think we deserve it?

01:39.580 --> 01:46.820
Patreon.com slash PretendingPod, at PretendingPod on Twitter and Instagram, Reddit.com slash

01:46.820 --> 01:52.900
all slash PretendingToBePeople, write a review on Apple Podcasts, why don't ya?

01:52.940 --> 01:59.300
Let the congregation say amen, an elf, a dwarf, and a wizard.

01:59.300 --> 02:05.100
Blessed are the measures that light the fuse, let's erupt the oppressors and we'll write

02:05.100 --> 02:06.980
the news.

02:06.980 --> 02:13.180
The PCs all woke up feeling strange and finding they'd been pricked in their veins right in

02:13.180 --> 02:15.060
the pit of their elbows.

02:15.060 --> 02:19.180
Hmm, elbows, the knees of the arms.

02:19.180 --> 02:26.060
Zack fucked up Justin's reaction to failing his constitution check, and I'll bet it never

02:26.060 --> 02:27.820
comes up again.

02:27.820 --> 02:32.420
Seriously, he just thought Justin succeeded that check for some reason.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.660
Hmm, he must've been all nervous and shit.

02:35.660 --> 02:37.940
What a dumb motherfucker.

02:37.940 --> 02:43.340
Anyway, Martin twisted his ankle in the go bag hiding place he had previously covered

02:43.340 --> 02:46.540
up and he found the go bag was missing.

02:46.580 --> 02:51.820
He also cannot remember arriving here at calm, comfy campground.

02:51.820 --> 02:58.380
Walter and Alan discussed who to trust, deciding they could only trust each other.

02:58.380 --> 03:05.140
However, Walter no longer trusts Alan due to his memory of Alan trying to sell him.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.700
Charles Digby had a knock at the door.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.580
The bellboy Leon was looking for Jack Russell and Jack Russell was hiding under the floor.

03:13.620 --> 03:18.580
They talked about an inoculation and Digby promised he wouldn't snitch.

03:18.580 --> 03:23.740
Roger Fairfield realized he'd been drugged and found a hair tie near the open window

03:23.740 --> 03:27.340
that was locked and closed when he had gone to sleep.

03:27.340 --> 03:32.660
The hair seemed to match a young girl named Maggie who ran from James to Angela while

03:32.660 --> 03:34.220
calling her Ann.

03:34.220 --> 03:37.220
Hmm, nothing suspicious there.

03:37.260 --> 03:43.020
In the meeting room, Angela was called out into the hallway by James.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.820
Inside tensions rose.

03:44.820 --> 03:50.300
Walter tried to turn himself off after Martin violated his personal space.

03:50.300 --> 03:55.060
Walter came back with a throat punch that gave Thomas permission to do whatever he's

03:55.060 --> 03:56.060
doing.

03:56.060 --> 04:00.100
This week I got exactly what your soul desires.

04:00.100 --> 04:07.540
A brand new song, a premiere, a future classic, a modern myth, a song that makes you feel

04:07.540 --> 04:10.220
the right kind of wrong.

04:10.220 --> 04:16.380
It's Dream Girl, my babies, with Pretty Sexual.

04:30.100 --> 04:45.940
This is real, I dream I knew I'd make you be foolish

04:45.940 --> 04:52.060
Thomas Martin Cupertino just got fucking rocked in the throat by Walter Grimes.

04:52.060 --> 04:57.660
And all of a sudden you're sitting in a chair in a room, it's a pretty small room but it's

04:57.660 --> 05:04.420
made to feel even smaller because it is filled with flowers.

05:04.420 --> 05:10.900
So many flowers of all different varieties, shades and shapes that you've never seen before.

05:10.900 --> 05:16.260
Sitting right in front of you is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground

05:16.260 --> 05:21.860
sitting behind a desk and he has a folder in front of him and he looks up at you.

05:21.860 --> 05:28.100
Martin, go ahead and tell me a little bit more about Cube, I'm curious.

05:28.100 --> 05:35.580
Because of the state that your brain is in currently, go ahead and roll Constitution

05:35.580 --> 05:40.260
at a negative 40.

05:40.260 --> 05:45.860
Well 80, so I failed that, but I also didn't have much chance, I have a 55, so.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.500
Oh shit, yeah, that would have been rough.

05:48.500 --> 05:54.100
So you, maybe for the first time in your life, maybe for the first time in a long time you

05:54.100 --> 05:58.980
feel docile almost, you feel so pliant.

05:58.980 --> 06:06.580
Well I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about Cube, but I'll let you in on a little secret,

06:06.580 --> 06:12.420
yeah, you can know about Cube before the rest of the world, basically Cube is just a really

06:12.420 --> 06:19.100
expensive personal computer, looks like a jellybean, obviously modeled pretty heavily

06:19.100 --> 06:22.700
on the iMac, which was the thing in the late 90s.

06:22.700 --> 06:26.540
Really it's just all marketing baby, that's all Cube is.

06:26.540 --> 06:34.220
And how much money projected do you think that Cube is going to net?

06:34.220 --> 06:38.780
If a sucker's born every minute then quite a bit, my calculations seem to show it's more

06:38.780 --> 06:44.940
like 48.5 seconds, that's of course rising exponentially with global population, but

06:44.940 --> 06:50.580
once we reach the crest of that, really you need to get in now within 30 years when the

06:50.580 --> 06:55.180
population of western nations are plummeting and the markets aren't there yet in the developing

06:55.180 --> 07:00.620
nations, there's just not going to be as many fools per capita to sell to, you really want

07:00.620 --> 07:01.820
to get in right now.

07:01.820 --> 07:02.820
Well consider-

07:02.820 --> 07:04.780
On the verge of this new gilded age.

07:04.780 --> 07:05.780
Me sold.

07:05.780 --> 07:06.780
Sold.

07:06.780 --> 07:09.420
You want to buy a Cube?

07:09.420 --> 07:16.020
He flips open the folder and there's a thick stack of documents in there.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.020
Please.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.140
What do you get, what's that, what do you have there?

07:20.140 --> 07:30.540
And he holds a pen out to you and you see on the folder it's titled Operation Hole Puncher.

07:30.540 --> 07:35.920
And inside there's document after document after document and he hands you a pen and

07:35.920 --> 07:39.180
he needs you to sign at the bottom of every page.

07:39.180 --> 07:46.180
It's like, yeah, I'll sign whatever.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.180
Is this ASMR?

07:48.180 --> 07:52.540
Do you like that?

07:52.540 --> 07:55.700
Man sits next to you and clicks pen, obnoxious.

07:55.700 --> 08:00.780
I'm clicking my pen right now for you.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.340
This is the worst.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.340
It's the worst.

08:03.340 --> 08:10.580
You're going to have to go to the Patreon to get that content, our ASMR Patreon feed.

08:10.580 --> 08:12.820
Oh no.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.500
Zach DM's you to sleep with.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.500
Oh my god.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.540
You're going to have to roll sanity for me.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.540
For me.

08:21.540 --> 08:27.500
You always say roll for me, which is like, seems a little bit like self-aggrandizing.

08:27.500 --> 08:32.580
Roll it for me.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.540
All right, Justin.

08:35.540 --> 08:40.260
You were in the meeting room a second ago, wait, you're sitting in this room.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.260
It's small.

08:41.260 --> 08:47.740
It's made to feel even smaller by the overwhelming amount of flowers in this room.

08:47.740 --> 08:53.540
Sitting across from you at a desk is James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground.

08:53.540 --> 08:58.100
He's looking through a folder and he looks up at you and these flowers that are all around

08:58.100 --> 09:02.220
you are the same flowers that you've seen all over the island.

09:02.220 --> 09:03.220
What color are they?

09:03.220 --> 09:09.180
All different kinds of colors, all different kinds of shapes, varied in many different

09:09.180 --> 09:10.180
ways.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.900
Charles, you take pictures, right?

09:12.900 --> 09:13.900
Part of your job?

09:13.900 --> 09:15.420
Yeah, pretty much.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.820
That's almost all I do these days.

09:17.820 --> 09:23.940
And you've got some pretty damning pictures of some fairly important people.

09:23.940 --> 09:24.940
Is that correct?

09:24.940 --> 09:29.120
Yeah, I can't quite say who, but yeah.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
We know who.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.620
And he's flipping through this folder.

09:32.620 --> 09:38.100
Charles, you feel, go ahead and roll a constitution at a negative 40.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.500
Oh, that's going to be hard.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
What's your constitution?

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
55.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
Oh boy.

09:44.500 --> 09:50.500
Oh, I crit failed, 55.

09:50.500 --> 09:54.180
It would have been a great success if you wouldn't have fucked me like that, Zach.

09:54.180 --> 09:59.060
It wasn't me that fucked you.

09:59.060 --> 10:03.420
You immediately list the people.

10:03.420 --> 10:10.300
There was the mayor, there was this actor guy that people around here know, there was

10:10.300 --> 10:14.060
a radio DJ, there was a city council member.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.060
All right, all right.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.060
Calm down.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.060
Calm down.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.060
I know.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.060
Charles Digby's like, wait, why did I?

10:19.060 --> 10:20.060
It's okay, Charles.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.060
Why?

10:21.060 --> 10:22.060
You're working with us now.

10:22.060 --> 10:26.060
I need you to sign these here documents.

10:26.060 --> 10:31.500
We're working together now as a team and we're going to need those pictures.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.380
Yeah, whatever you need.

10:34.380 --> 10:40.580
And you walk up to the desk and he's got this folder that says Operation Hole Puncher on

10:40.580 --> 10:41.580
it.

10:41.580 --> 10:45.700
And then he flips it open and there is a thick stack of documents there.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.700
All right.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.580
If you'll just sign and initial all these.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.580
I'm doing it.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.580
I'm getting in there very quickly.

10:51.580 --> 10:56.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:56.580 --> 10:57.580
All right.

10:57.580 --> 10:58.580
Thank you for your time.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.580
Thank you.

10:59.580 --> 11:00.580
Oh no.

11:00.580 --> 11:01.580
Oh no.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.580
I don't like where the-

11:02.580 --> 11:08.940
Roger, you were in that meeting room.

11:08.940 --> 11:13.780
Walter just like goes to punch, wait, no, you're sitting in this room.

11:13.780 --> 11:19.100
It's a small room and you're surrounded by flowers of every shape and shade.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.380
They're the exact same flowers you've been seeing all over this island, but you're not

11:22.380 --> 11:23.700
sure if this is a memory.

11:23.700 --> 11:27.580
It feels like a memory.

11:27.580 --> 11:33.280
It's a small room, but it's even smaller because of how many flowers are just surrounding you

11:33.280 --> 11:34.740
in every direction.

11:34.740 --> 11:40.620
And in front of you, there's a desk and behind that desk is James, executive director of

11:40.620 --> 11:41.940
the calm comfy campground.

11:41.940 --> 11:47.420
I need you to roll constitution at a negative 40.

11:47.420 --> 11:48.780
Oof.

11:48.780 --> 11:50.020
Dang.

11:50.020 --> 11:53.260
43 on what would be a 30.

11:53.260 --> 11:56.140
Roger, you were an archeologist.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.140
Is that right?

11:57.140 --> 11:58.140
Yeah.

11:58.140 --> 11:59.140
Yeah.

11:59.140 --> 12:00.140
And you're single, right?

12:00.140 --> 12:01.140
Yeah.

12:01.140 --> 12:02.140
Yeah.

12:02.740 --> 12:05.780
And what is this dig site you're working on right now?

12:05.780 --> 12:09.060
I mean, we don't exactly know it, but we're just calling it the nameless city right now.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.980
We don't know exactly what civilization it belonged to.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.300
We just found it.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.300
Interesting.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.300
Interesting.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.300
All right.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.300
Cool.

12:17.300 --> 12:21.460
Well, basically today we're just here to sign some paperwork so that our partnership can

12:21.460 --> 12:22.460
continue.

12:22.460 --> 12:23.460
Yeah.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.460
That sound good?

12:24.460 --> 12:25.460
Sure.

12:25.460 --> 12:26.460
Yeah, of course.

12:26.460 --> 12:30.540
And you approached the desk where he's got a folder that he opens up and the folder on

12:30.540 --> 12:32.980
the front says operation hole puncher.

12:32.980 --> 12:33.980
Oh, damn.

12:33.980 --> 12:37.940
I got to pull out my other notebooks, Zach.

12:37.940 --> 12:44.020
And inside there's a document after document that he has you sign an initial.

12:44.020 --> 12:45.020
Okay.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.020
I do.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.980
And he looks up and he's like, look forward to working more with you.

12:48.980 --> 12:52.060
And you too.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.740
What the fuck?

12:54.740 --> 13:04.980
Walter, you reach out and just like slam Martin Cupertino in the throat.

13:04.980 --> 13:08.180
And then all of a sudden you're just standing in this room.

13:08.180 --> 13:13.020
Next to you is Alan Grimes, who you know as your handler.

13:13.020 --> 13:17.400
And in front of him is a desk.

13:17.400 --> 13:21.420
Behind that desk is James, executive director at Calm Comfy Campground.

13:21.420 --> 13:27.000
This room is filled with flowers of all different shade and shape.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.820
It's the exact same flowers that are covering the Island where calm comfy campground sits

13:32.820 --> 13:36.240
and you are completely docile.

13:36.240 --> 13:40.620
So Alan, you're saying that you've got more of these.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.620
Yes.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.620
Yes.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.140
I've got, we have warehouses in Washington.

13:44.140 --> 13:48.100
We have warehouses in Chicago, new Orleans, Las Vegas.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.780
We have access to as many as you need.

13:50.820 --> 13:57.900
Well, that is, that is something else and they'll just do whatever they'll just do whatever

13:57.900 --> 13:58.900
you want.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.900
Yes.

13:59.900 --> 14:00.900
Yes, absolutely.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.240
Hey, uh, Hey kid, touch your nose.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.240
Walter touches his nose.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.900
Luke touches his nose immediately, but Walter touches his nose.

14:08.900 --> 14:09.900
Oh damn.

14:09.900 --> 14:10.900
That shit's wild.

14:10.900 --> 14:11.900
Slap your face.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.180
Oh, it looks like it hurt.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.180
Yeah.

14:15.180 --> 14:16.180
I liked it.

14:16.180 --> 14:17.180
He slaps his face.

14:17.180 --> 14:18.180
Man.

14:18.580 --> 14:19.580
Man.

14:19.580 --> 14:20.580
All right.

14:20.580 --> 14:21.900
Well, uh, shit.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.160
Let's go ahead and take this partnership to the next level.

14:24.160 --> 14:30.380
Let's sign some paperwork and Alan Grimes approaches the desk where James has a folder

14:30.380 --> 14:33.060
that's labeled operation hole puncher.

14:33.060 --> 14:36.100
And inside there's a bunch of paperwork.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.420
Alan just signs and signs and initials and signs.

14:40.420 --> 14:43.980
Alan turns back to you, salutes.

14:43.980 --> 14:47.140
Thank you for your service.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.180
Thank you.

14:54.180 --> 14:57.180
Bad rolls out of the way.

14:57.180 --> 15:00.180
It's like warming up at the free throw line before the game.

15:00.180 --> 15:03.180
Let's clank a couple.

15:03.180 --> 15:06.180
Visualize the failure.

15:06.180 --> 15:09.180
That's what my mom tells me.

15:09.180 --> 15:12.180
It's a real fucking bummer.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.180
I'm sorry, man.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.180
It's okay.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.180
It's okay.

15:16.220 --> 15:17.220
It's okay.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.220
It's okay.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.220
So in our last alone session, was the minotaur speaking English?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.220
Yeah.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.220
Okay.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.220
Just kidding.

15:23.220 --> 15:24.220
I remember that.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.220
Y'all looked at me.

15:26.220 --> 15:29.220
What the fuck happened to Joe?

15:29.220 --> 15:31.220
Bradley Cooper, you like step back.

15:31.220 --> 15:37.220
Like you just got punched in the throat and everyone's eyes just kind of cross each other.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.220
Walter.

15:38.220 --> 15:42.220
I'm sorry.

15:42.220 --> 15:44.220
Just reflexes I guess.

15:44.260 --> 15:45.260
You little bastard.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.260
I didn't.

15:51.260 --> 15:52.260
I didn't.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.260
Cool.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.260
And it's silent.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.260
All right.

16:03.260 --> 16:06.260
Now you're just milking it.

16:06.260 --> 16:09.260
Somebody punch him again.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.260
Walter, you didn't need to punch him.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.260
That was.

16:12.260 --> 16:13.260
What?

16:13.300 --> 16:15.300
I mean, he was a reflex.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.300
He touched me.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.300
He did.

16:17.300 --> 16:18.300
He did.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.300
He did touch you.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.300
That's true.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.300
Are you okay, Brad?

16:21.300 --> 16:22.300
I like walk over to him.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.300
I kind of.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.300
No.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.300
Fuck you kid.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.300
I hate this fucking kid.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.300
I hate this calm, cozy campground.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.300
I'm leaving immediately.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.300
I'm gone.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.300
I want a refund.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.300
Where's James?

16:38.300 --> 16:41.300
Did anyone else just see James somewhere?

16:41.340 --> 16:44.340
I just had a, was it a memory?

16:44.340 --> 16:48.340
I'm having these weird flashbacks like we had last night.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.340
That happened to you guys?

16:50.340 --> 16:53.340
Was that a flashback or a dream?

16:53.340 --> 16:56.340
I don't know, but I am so sorry.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.340
I am so sorry, Walter.

16:58.340 --> 17:00.340
I don't know what that was.

17:00.340 --> 17:07.340
Walter kind of like squints at his dad and just kind of looks ahead and doesn't say anything else.

17:07.340 --> 17:10.340
I was in a room full of flowers with him.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.380
Were you guys in that room?

17:12.380 --> 17:14.380
It was the flowers all around the island.

17:14.380 --> 17:17.380
That's kind of an old trick.

17:17.380 --> 17:22.380
We'd do it in the waiting room when we had to renegotiate contracts.

17:22.380 --> 17:27.380
You fill it all with flowers so it looks like people really care about you and are thinking about you.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.380
And it just makes the other person feel small.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.380
I pegged it right away.

17:31.380 --> 17:33.380
I definitely felt small in there.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.380
They were.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.380
Like you'd never been sent that many flowers in your life.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.380
They were all around.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.380
It made the room feel smaller.

17:39.420 --> 17:42.420
Boy, whoever got these flowers must be important.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.420
That's really the play there.

17:44.420 --> 17:46.420
At least it was with us.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.420
I think we need to find James.

17:47.420 --> 17:53.420
If my recollection of the memory is correct, then I absolutely need to find James.

17:53.420 --> 17:58.420
I think last we left off, I was kind of heading toward the door to get Angela back from him.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.420
So I'm probably heading toward that door anyway.

18:00.420 --> 18:07.420
Yeah, and when the door opens up, there are two people wearing staff clothing,

18:07.460 --> 18:13.460
which you haven't seen before, but it is the calm, comfy campground staff uniform.

18:13.460 --> 18:20.460
And it is like a one-piece jumpsuit with a collar that goes all the way up buttoned to the top.

18:20.460 --> 18:25.460
It is a tall broad woman and a short scrawny man.

18:25.460 --> 18:28.460
And they both have spray bottles in their hands.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.460
Who the fuck are these boners?

18:30.460 --> 18:31.460
What the fuck is that in their hands?

18:31.460 --> 18:36.460
They immediately go to spray the two who are heading straight for the door,

18:36.500 --> 18:40.500
which is Roger Fairfield and Bradley Cooper.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.500
Can I athletics away?

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
Yeah, you can absolutely try.

18:45.500 --> 18:49.500
Do you want to try to get out of the spray range there, Roger?

18:51.500 --> 18:52.500
Yeah.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.500
I fail.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
They both fail miserably on their attempt to spray,

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
but something about seeing these bottles...

19:05.540 --> 19:07.540
I got an eight on my attempt to help away.

19:07.540 --> 19:08.540
Oh, hell yeah.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.540
How do you get out of the way?

19:09.540 --> 19:11.540
I just straight up like Neo.

19:11.540 --> 19:19.540
The Matrix hasn't come out yet, so it's really innovative and revolutionary and shockingly cinematic.

19:19.540 --> 19:25.540
But yeah, I just lean back away from the spray, duck behind the guy,

19:25.540 --> 19:27.540
and I want to try to grab the spray out of his hands.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.540
You do grab the spray bottle out of his hands.

19:30.540 --> 19:34.540
Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Ellen Grimes, and Roger Fairfield,

19:34.580 --> 19:37.580
you are all standing together in a cottage.

19:37.580 --> 19:42.580
It is familiar because the setup is the same as the cottage each of you have been staying in.

19:42.580 --> 19:45.580
However, this cottage is filled with surveillance equipment.

19:45.580 --> 19:50.580
Screens line the walls, and you can see the grounds of Calm Comfy Campground,

19:50.580 --> 19:54.580
the insides of Cottages 3, 5, 7, and 9,

19:54.580 --> 19:59.580
as well as, it seems, the forests that surround Lake Calm.

19:59.580 --> 20:00.580
Do I still have the bottle in my hand?

20:00.580 --> 20:01.580
No.

20:01.580 --> 20:02.580
Where are we?

20:02.580 --> 20:03.580
Where the fuck are we?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.620
Everybody roll alertness.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.620
Fail.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.620
69.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.620
Fuck, I fail also.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.620
Ooh, great success.

20:13.620 --> 20:14.620
Ooh, nice.

20:14.620 --> 20:15.620
Success.

20:15.620 --> 20:16.620
Walter, nice.

20:16.620 --> 20:23.620
Walter immediately looks down at his arm and sees that there is not a puncture,

20:23.620 --> 20:25.620
like a mark of blood where there was.

20:25.620 --> 20:28.620
Can I see if anybody else still has that?

20:28.620 --> 20:32.620
If they'll show you their arms under their sleeves.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.660
Do you guys still have, look, do you still have your mark?

20:36.660 --> 20:37.660
Let me check.

20:37.660 --> 20:39.660
No one has the mark.

20:39.660 --> 20:42.660
Does it always seem to be the same time of year at Calm Comfy Campground?

20:42.660 --> 20:43.660
It does.

20:43.660 --> 20:48.660
And because you Chris Exceed, you actually will see on the surveillance footage.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.660
What surveillance footage?

20:50.660 --> 20:56.660
So the screens in front of you are showing all of Calm Comfy Campground essentially,

20:56.700 --> 21:03.700
and you see there is a tall, broad woman and a short, scrawny man, both with a bottle

21:03.700 --> 21:10.700
in their hand, heading toward a cottage, which you innately feel is this cottage.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.700
We can set an ambush for him, boys.

21:12.700 --> 21:18.700
Was the cottage, there was one that had like a tent, like a spray tent or whatever.

21:18.700 --> 21:19.700
Sure.

21:19.700 --> 21:20.700
Do we see that on the surveillance?

21:20.700 --> 21:21.700
No.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.700
Looking out the window, do I see it draped in a tent?

21:23.700 --> 21:24.700
No.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
Oh.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.740
Which cottage do you think we're in?

21:27.740 --> 21:28.740
Probably the one that was tinted.

21:28.740 --> 21:30.740
What did you say, three, five, seven, nine?

21:30.740 --> 21:32.740
Those are the ones you can see on the footage, yeah.

21:32.740 --> 21:33.740
Which one was tinted?

21:33.740 --> 21:34.740
Five was me, right?

21:34.740 --> 21:35.740
Yes.

21:35.740 --> 21:36.740
I was in nine.

21:36.740 --> 21:37.740
I was in three, I believe.

21:37.740 --> 21:38.740
And seven.

21:38.740 --> 21:39.740
Yeah.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.740
Those are the four that you guys are in, yeah.

21:42.740 --> 21:45.740
Yeah, I think we're in that tinted cottage.

21:45.740 --> 21:49.740
So is it before it was tinted or after it was tinted and then taken down?

21:49.740 --> 21:53.740
No way to know yet, but it looks like we've got the jump on these fools.

21:53.740 --> 21:54.740
We can see them coming.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.780
What do you think they're doing with those bottles?

21:56.780 --> 21:57.780
They're going to subdue us.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.780
When you grabbed it, could you tell what was in it?

22:00.780 --> 22:06.780
No, it's like some kind of controlling force sped us away from that moment before I could

22:06.780 --> 22:09.780
investigate any further on that awesome roll I got.

22:11.780 --> 22:12.780
It was a success.

22:12.780 --> 22:13.780
What do you suggest that we do?

22:13.780 --> 22:16.780
Well, I think you should go out to greet them.

22:16.780 --> 22:17.780
Okay.

22:17.780 --> 22:18.780
Wait.

22:18.780 --> 22:19.780
Don't just greet them.

22:19.780 --> 22:20.780
Run to the door.

22:20.780 --> 22:21.780
Tell them to get in quick.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.780
Tell them there's an emergency.

22:23.820 --> 22:27.820
We'll wait in the hallways in the crevices.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.820
We're going to, we're going to jump these fools.

22:29.820 --> 22:30.820
Okay.

22:30.820 --> 22:31.820
How far away?

22:31.820 --> 22:35.820
Roger real quick wants to look around this room for anything that he can use to, uh,

22:35.820 --> 22:38.820
uh, if we do subdue them to be able to tie them up.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.820
So like cording or roping.

22:40.820 --> 22:43.820
Hold towels in front of yourself so they can't spray you.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.820
Yeah, you can, you can find ties.

22:45.820 --> 22:46.820
Oh, okay.

22:46.820 --> 22:47.820
Yeah.

22:47.820 --> 22:48.820
What are those called?

22:48.820 --> 22:49.820
Like zip ties?

22:49.820 --> 22:50.820
Is that what you mean?

22:50.820 --> 22:51.820
Okay.

22:51.820 --> 22:52.820
I was hoping to be able to use my knot skill.

22:52.860 --> 23:00.860
He's like, well, okay, if you've got to use cheaters knots.

23:00.860 --> 23:06.860
Are there any big, uh, calm, cozy comforters like on the couch, like big knit, uh, there's

23:06.860 --> 23:10.860
actually no, there's nothing in here except for surveillance equipment.

23:10.860 --> 23:15.860
So there's not like a bed or any grab a monitor boys and we're just going to chuck it at their

23:15.860 --> 23:16.860
heads.

23:16.860 --> 23:17.860
Everybody grabs a monitor.

23:17.860 --> 23:18.860
How heavy are the monitors?

23:18.860 --> 23:21.860
They're like nineties action movie, little security camera monitors, right?

23:21.900 --> 23:22.900
Yeah.

23:22.900 --> 23:23.900
They're just all over the place.

23:23.900 --> 23:24.900
Yeah.

23:24.900 --> 23:25.900
And like stacked on top of each other and shit.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.900
I just toss one to each of them.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.900
How far away are the sprayers?

23:30.900 --> 23:32.900
Uh, they're approaching right now.

23:32.900 --> 23:33.900
I look at Martin.

23:33.900 --> 23:34.900
Do I go now?

23:34.900 --> 23:35.900
Do it.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.900
I run out the front door.

23:37.900 --> 23:38.900
How far away are they?

23:38.900 --> 23:39.900
Can I see them?

23:39.900 --> 23:41.900
They're, they're literally right in front of you.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.900
There's, I like shut the door behind me so they can't see.

23:45.900 --> 23:49.900
There's something is wrong in there.

23:49.900 --> 23:50.900
Yeah.

23:50.940 --> 23:51.940
In the face.

23:51.940 --> 23:52.940
Like immediately.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.940
As soon as they walk up to you.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.940
What do we see happen as we're holding our monitors?

23:56.940 --> 23:57.940
Yeah.

23:57.940 --> 24:03.940
You guys are watching from, from inside and you just see, as soon as he gets sprayed immediately,

24:03.940 --> 24:07.940
his chin goes down to his chest and he just stops moving.

24:07.940 --> 24:08.940
Okay.

24:08.940 --> 24:09.940
They turned him off.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.940
Does the door open in or out?

24:11.940 --> 24:12.940
In.

24:12.940 --> 24:13.940
Well, yeah.

24:13.940 --> 24:14.940
I just want to wait for them to come through the door and then we all check our monitors

24:14.940 --> 24:15.940
at them, at their head.

24:15.940 --> 24:18.940
After, after they've sprayed him, do they do anything with him or do they walk past

24:18.940 --> 24:19.940
him?

24:19.980 --> 24:20.980
They walk right past him.

24:20.980 --> 24:21.980
Yeah.

24:21.980 --> 24:22.980
They just keep moving.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.980
And, uh, everyone roll humid.

24:24.980 --> 24:25.980
Me too or?

24:25.980 --> 24:26.980
No.

24:26.980 --> 24:27.980
Shouldn't listen to.

24:27.980 --> 24:28.980
Pass.

24:28.980 --> 24:29.980
37 on a 60.

24:29.980 --> 24:30.980
Pass.

24:30.980 --> 24:32.980
Tell you what I'm told.

24:32.980 --> 24:39.980
So you guys noticed that there is no emotion or anything on these two's faces.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.980
There is just a blank expression.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.980
Look, they're drone people.

24:44.980 --> 24:48.980
If you accidentally clobber them too hard, you know, they go down for good.

24:49.020 --> 24:53.020
You don't have to feel bad about it because clearly they're already dead inside.

24:53.020 --> 24:55.020
So what's the plan from the inside?

24:55.020 --> 24:56.020
Clobber.

24:56.020 --> 25:00.020
Just as soon as they open the door, three monitors smashing down on their heads before

25:00.020 --> 25:02.020
they can even fucking like see.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
I'll try.

25:03.020 --> 25:04.020
I'll try.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.020
Martin.

25:05.020 --> 25:06.020
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a fighter.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.020
I'm not a fighter.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.020
I'm not a fighter.

25:08.020 --> 25:09.020
Hey, hey, hey.

25:09.020 --> 25:10.020
Pull yourself to fucking gather, man.

25:10.020 --> 25:13.060
He's going to go kind of toward the back of the room, but be ready to throw.

25:13.060 --> 25:16.780
While they were also searching, is there like a gun on any of the desks nearby or anything

25:16.780 --> 25:17.780
like that?

25:17.780 --> 25:18.780
No.

25:19.580 --> 25:24.260
But you guys can, if you're all doing the monitor gig, I'd like to do a wield monitors.

25:24.260 --> 25:34.580
You can roll athletics or strength and I'll give you guys an advantage of a Thomas.

25:34.580 --> 25:38.460
You would take no advantage, but the other two can have a plus 20.

25:38.460 --> 25:45.780
The reason you don't have an advantage is because you're using two.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.660
I absolutely fail even with all the advantage.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.660
Yeah.

25:49.660 --> 25:50.660
Same.

25:50.660 --> 25:51.660
Okay.

25:51.660 --> 25:56.700
I rolled an 11 and a 100, but these are, are these contested?

25:56.700 --> 25:57.700
Yeah.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.700
Okay.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.700
So you're fucked either way.

25:59.700 --> 26:01.260
Well, what did you roll?

26:01.260 --> 26:04.640
I rolled a 57 and my skill is 65.

26:04.640 --> 26:10.340
So if we're doing highest without going over, I completely smashed two monitors on both

26:10.340 --> 26:11.340
your fucking heads.

26:11.740 --> 26:14.540
The 11 was a crit success, right?

26:14.540 --> 26:17.820
But it's still for, but that doesn't count a contested rules, does it?

26:17.820 --> 26:18.820
Yes, absolutely.

26:18.820 --> 26:19.820
It trumps everything.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.820
If it's a crit.

26:20.820 --> 26:21.820
You've played this game, right?

26:21.820 --> 26:24.380
Yeah, but this, these rules are weird.

26:24.380 --> 26:27.940
Always have been, always will be, I suppose.

26:27.940 --> 26:32.540
Only when you lose though, do they seem to be weird.

26:32.540 --> 26:36.300
You just keep inventing conditions in which I can lose.

26:36.300 --> 26:39.540
I turn back on and attack them.

26:39.540 --> 26:43.540
No, you absolutely smashed one of them.

26:43.540 --> 26:46.180
We'll say the tall woman who is extremely bright.

26:46.180 --> 26:47.420
You were rolling for them.

26:47.420 --> 26:51.900
These aren't my rules.

26:51.900 --> 26:53.660
What game is this?

26:53.660 --> 26:56.860
So you describe how one of them goes down.

26:56.860 --> 27:01.180
Well, the first one through the door just gets like, I just straight up lob this monitor

27:01.180 --> 27:02.620
right in their face.

27:02.620 --> 27:07.660
They don't even see it coming, just like full fucking glass to the face.

27:07.660 --> 27:08.660
They go down.

27:08.660 --> 27:13.100
Oh, immediately, literally laying back on the ground with a TV on their head.

27:13.100 --> 27:16.380
But that was my right hand and I'm not as good with my left hand.

27:16.380 --> 27:20.060
And so the person immediately behind them has a little time to like see it and duck

27:20.060 --> 27:23.100
and it's not as like strong or good a throw.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.100
Roger, what did you roll?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.580
A fail, a 97.

27:25.580 --> 27:26.580
Okay.

27:26.580 --> 27:28.340
And then we got a successor fail over here.

27:28.340 --> 27:29.340
Fail 93.

27:29.340 --> 27:30.340
Okay, fantastic.

27:31.060 --> 27:32.060
All right.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.500
So the other one is going to...

27:34.500 --> 27:38.100
Can we just throw our monitors up into the air?

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
Yikes!

27:40.100 --> 27:46.200
Immediately horrified, the little scrawny guy was not expecting this and he, still,

27:46.200 --> 27:49.900
no scream, no holler, no anything.

27:49.900 --> 27:54.540
And he just holds up his spray bottle and begins spraying and running toward you guys.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.180
Is it like a squirty spray or like a misty spray?

27:57.180 --> 27:59.460
It's a misty spray.

27:59.460 --> 28:00.460
Luckily.

28:00.460 --> 28:01.460
Yeah.

28:01.460 --> 28:03.300
Can I do something to avoid that now?

28:03.300 --> 28:04.300
Yeah, absolutely.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.620
So this will be another contested roll.

28:05.620 --> 28:07.300
Wait, is he going after the both of us?

28:07.300 --> 28:08.300
He's coming after the room.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.300
He's coming after the room.

28:09.300 --> 28:12.140
You guys are all like right there in the front.

28:12.140 --> 28:13.620
What are we rolling?

28:13.620 --> 28:15.340
Athletics or dexterity.

28:15.340 --> 28:16.780
Okay, let me try rolling again.

28:16.780 --> 28:17.780
Or dodge.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.780
And you roll the...

28:18.780 --> 28:19.780
83.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.780
Not a good fail.

28:20.780 --> 28:21.780
Oh, okay.

28:21.780 --> 28:23.780
Oh my God.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.540
Do I get any bonuses to this one?

28:26.540 --> 28:27.540
No, you do not.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.940
I got a 53 on a 50.

28:28.940 --> 28:32.700
I got a four on a 65.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.580
He actually also failed.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.260
So does he spray himself?

28:37.260 --> 28:38.260
Not a crypto.

28:38.260 --> 28:39.260
He does.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.260
He sprays himself.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.140
However, there seems to be no ill effect.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.140
Okay.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.860
I want to just fucking punch him in the face.

28:45.860 --> 28:49.260
So literally what happened is he's spraying as he's walking and you guys all just like

28:49.260 --> 28:54.780
walk into rooms and he's just like walking down the hallway with his arm out flat just

28:54.780 --> 28:59.700
spraying it forward and then he's going to turn around and he's going to change the bottle

28:59.700 --> 29:04.020
into his other hand and then spray and just walk down the hallway the other way.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.020
Back out the door.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.020
He's heading back through the hallway.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.180
He's basically just trying to...

29:08.180 --> 29:09.180
Corner us.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.180
Yeah.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.180
Yeah.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.380
Whatever room I've ended up in now, can I see if there's a window that I could break

29:12.380 --> 29:13.380
out?

29:13.380 --> 29:14.380
Oh yeah, for sure.

29:14.380 --> 29:15.380
What do I do?

29:15.380 --> 29:16.380
You see a window.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.380
I want to break it out.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.380
Or open it.

29:18.380 --> 29:19.380
Or open it.

29:19.380 --> 29:24.380
I got to get out of here.

29:24.380 --> 29:25.380
I'm going to slam my head through it.

29:25.380 --> 29:26.380
It's bleeding all over everything.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.380
The glass hurts so bad.

29:27.380 --> 29:28.380
It's all worth it.

29:28.380 --> 29:29.380
Open it.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.380
Can I open it?

29:30.380 --> 29:31.380
Yeah.

29:31.380 --> 29:32.380
You open the window.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.380
Okay.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.380
I'm going to crawl out.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.380
Okay.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.380
Sounds good.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.380
Justin, what are you doing?

29:37.380 --> 29:41.660
Can I see if there's something I can use to bludgeon like something with some reach like

29:41.660 --> 29:45.900
a bat or another monitor or something.

29:45.900 --> 29:46.900
Yeah.

29:46.900 --> 29:49.660
There's actually a...

29:49.660 --> 29:50.660
Help me out here guys.

29:50.660 --> 29:51.660
A tripod.

29:51.660 --> 29:52.660
What would...

29:52.660 --> 29:53.820
A tripod would be pretty good.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.260
What could he use?

29:55.260 --> 29:56.780
No, something far more.

29:56.780 --> 29:57.780
There's like a...

29:57.780 --> 29:58.780
Like an empty bed frame?

29:58.780 --> 29:59.780
No, there's a...

29:59.780 --> 30:00.780
A keyboard.

30:00.780 --> 30:01.780
Fuck.

30:01.780 --> 30:02.820
Tennis racket.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.700
We're giving you golden things that can be in a cabin.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.640
Loose wood panel on the floor.

30:06.640 --> 30:07.640
There's a snowshoe.

30:07.640 --> 30:11.140
There's a big hairy mean dog.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.140
An old fishing pole.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.780
An old fisher man.

30:13.780 --> 30:15.780
A samurai sword.

30:15.780 --> 30:20.780
I got a collection of samurai swords and bazookas in here.

30:20.780 --> 30:23.120
Bazookas and grenades and land mines.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.480
It's one of those things on the wall with the pinned insects on it.

30:26.480 --> 30:30.280
There's a bigger spray bottle.

30:30.280 --> 30:35.120
There's a spray bottle that says anti-spray bottles guy.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.360
There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.360
Ooh, that one.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.360
That one, yeah.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.360
That one.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.360
That one.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.360
There's a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.520
I pick it up for violence.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.320
Don't destroy that art.

30:46.320 --> 30:53.080
God damn, now I want a taxidermied frog holding a banjo.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.480
That's some quality folk art.

30:55.480 --> 31:00.560
I want to hide around the corner if there's a nook of some kind where I can get a jump

31:00.560 --> 31:01.560
on him.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.560
Yeah, absolutely.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.560
You got it.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.560
Okay.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
I'm just going to wait.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.560
Does the door open in or out of this room?

31:06.560 --> 31:07.560
There's no door.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
Oh.

31:08.560 --> 31:15.440
Well, there goes my plan to wang him on the head with a door.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.800
What kind of taxidermy is in my room?

31:17.800 --> 31:21.240
Ooh, a raccoon with a straw hat.

31:21.240 --> 31:22.240
Yes.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
And a reed.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
Yeah, absolutely.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.400
A long reed.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.280
The reed is actually longer than the raccoon is tall.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.160
I pluck the reed and I start chewing on it.

31:32.160 --> 31:37.300
And I, yeah, it tastes like old glue.

31:37.300 --> 31:42.400
And I hold this thing like a baseball bat and I'm also behind my corner just waiting

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
for him to come in.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.320
When you say hold it like a baseball bat, are you holding it by the head and its feet

31:46.320 --> 31:47.320
are standing up?

31:47.320 --> 31:48.320
Or are you holding it by-

31:48.320 --> 31:51.340
I'm holding it by the feet and its head is the club end.

31:51.340 --> 31:53.840
And I imagine its arms are doing kind of cute things.

31:53.840 --> 31:57.020
So those are kind of like little spikes coming out from it.

31:57.020 --> 32:01.660
Yeah, that's like a D12 weapon at least.

32:01.660 --> 32:02.780
At least.

32:02.780 --> 32:07.660
He won't see either one of these attacks coming, so you guys can both roll with a plus 20 and

32:07.660 --> 32:08.660
it won't be opposed.

32:08.660 --> 32:09.660
Wang him.

32:09.660 --> 32:10.660
Who goes first?

32:10.660 --> 32:12.420
Both of you at the same time.

32:12.420 --> 32:14.260
Is this athletics or?

32:14.260 --> 32:15.260
You can roll-

32:15.260 --> 32:16.260
Oh, this would be not-

32:16.260 --> 32:18.260
This would be melee combat.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.420
Oh, no.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.420
Are you sure?

32:21.420 --> 32:23.820
Oh, hell yeah.

32:23.820 --> 32:24.820
Plus 20?

32:24.820 --> 32:25.820
Yeah.

32:25.820 --> 32:26.820
Okay, I have a 50.

32:26.820 --> 32:29.180
I rolled a 52, but I have a plus 20, so limo.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.340
Yeah, I failed big time.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.340
97.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.940
Okay, so thankfully the frog stays intact.

32:34.940 --> 32:36.440
Oh, thank God.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.940
That's all I cared for.

32:37.940 --> 32:40.340
You swing right over this.

32:40.340 --> 32:44.420
He's a very short fella and you were expecting the tall broad woman, right?

32:44.420 --> 32:46.900
And so you swing right over his head, but thankfully-

32:46.900 --> 32:54.020
Yeah, I see his shadow come through the doorway and I just wind up and fucking Sammy Sosa

32:54.020 --> 32:58.940
this motherfucker right in his face with the raccoon teeth pointed out.

32:58.940 --> 33:04.500
If I could catch those on an eyeball or something, I'm really trying to do maximum damage.

33:04.500 --> 33:12.700
Yeah, you catch the teeth on an eyeball and his eye, as he hits the ground completely

33:12.700 --> 33:21.740
unconscious, you see that there is the string essentially holding the eyeball in place,

33:21.740 --> 33:28.460
is actually stretched fully out and you still are holding on to the other end and if you

33:28.460 --> 33:29.460
kind of like-

33:29.460 --> 33:31.620
Yeah, I try to get my raccoon loose.

33:31.620 --> 33:37.580
Yeah, and his head is just like pop, pop, pop, like hitting against the ground.

33:37.580 --> 33:42.940
When I finally give it the pull that rips the eye out with the raccoon and his head

33:42.940 --> 33:50.620
flunks down to the ground, I bow and I say, Namaste and I walk out.

33:50.620 --> 33:58.300
I also collect his spray bottle and I think I want to change into his clothes and I come

33:58.300 --> 34:02.340
out into the room to do all that, so Justin just sees me in the process of becoming fully

34:02.340 --> 34:03.340
nude.

34:03.340 --> 34:05.780
There's no time to waste.

34:05.780 --> 34:06.780
Oh, okay.

34:06.980 --> 34:09.940
Can I go find the woman's clothes and change into them?

34:09.940 --> 34:10.940
Yeah.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.500
Okay, so I want to investigate this bottle.

34:12.500 --> 34:17.620
It is just a spray bottle, there's absolutely nothing on it and you're looking at it and

34:17.620 --> 34:23.400
you're standing in the meeting room for where you had orientation and you're looking over

34:23.400 --> 34:26.540
the spray bottle that you have in your hand.

34:26.540 --> 34:27.540
Dope.

34:27.540 --> 34:31.660
Bradley Cooper is looking down at the spray bottle and when you do, you-

34:31.660 --> 34:33.500
I think you can call me my real name now.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.500
Oh, Martin Cupertino.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.500
Who?

34:35.500 --> 34:36.500
Oh.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.500
Oh.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.500
A billionaire?

34:38.500 --> 34:39.620
What a billionaire.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.980
Looking down at this spray bottle and as you're holding it-

34:42.980 --> 34:47.820
I was really proud of that word and then I Googled it and it's definitely a thing.

34:47.820 --> 34:48.820
Oh, yeah.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.820
It makes sense.

34:49.820 --> 34:50.820
Cupertino?

34:50.820 --> 34:51.820
Yeah.

34:51.820 --> 34:52.820
Garden?

34:52.820 --> 34:53.820
Billionaire.

34:53.820 --> 34:54.820
Oh.

34:54.820 --> 34:55.820
Oh.

34:55.820 --> 35:01.980
Cupertino was a very intentional choice.

35:01.980 --> 35:07.620
I just like came up with that and it was wild.

35:07.620 --> 35:08.620
That's what I thought you were saying.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.620
I was like, yeah, man.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.620
No, no, no.

35:10.620 --> 35:11.620
Billionaire.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.460
Uh, well, you know what they say.

35:13.460 --> 35:14.460
There was a...

35:14.460 --> 35:15.460
Uh, no.

35:15.460 --> 35:16.460
Oh, well.

35:16.460 --> 35:17.460
Who?

35:17.460 --> 35:21.740
Um, stop it.

35:21.740 --> 35:26.540
So when you look down at this bottle, you see that there is a piece of tape on it and

35:26.540 --> 35:36.020
written on the piece of tape is the word Sanfera Blom, S-A-N-F-E-R-R-A space B-L-O-M.

35:36.020 --> 35:37.620
Sanfera Blom.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.700
Yes.

35:38.700 --> 35:43.340
And as you're holding it, real quick, Roger Fairfield, roll an intelligence check for

35:43.340 --> 35:45.860
me.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.380
I pass a 43 on a 75.

35:48.380 --> 35:56.060
You would recognize that name from the book that you're reading of the flora in the area.

35:56.580 --> 35:57.580
Nice.

35:57.580 --> 35:58.580
I remember it as a plant.

35:58.580 --> 35:59.580
Yes.

35:59.580 --> 36:05.420
And Martin Cupertino, you smell this bottle like it is pungent and you can smell.

36:05.420 --> 36:08.820
It's the exact same smell of the flowers that are all over this island.

36:08.820 --> 36:09.820
Cool.

36:09.820 --> 36:12.500
Can I remember details about what I read about it?

36:12.500 --> 36:14.720
Guys, guys, guys, everybody shut up.

36:14.720 --> 36:15.720
Shut up.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.720
Shut up.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.900
Remember all the flowers blooming in the city.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.900
Oh, I don't.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.140
That's a different character.

36:28.140 --> 36:30.140
I remember though.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.140
Yeah.

36:31.140 --> 36:32.140
Nice.

36:32.140 --> 36:33.140
Interesting.

36:33.140 --> 36:39.300
You get five luck points for not this character, but maybe in the future when we're using

36:39.300 --> 36:40.300
luck.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.300
Right.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.300
Write it down.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.300
I'm just going to...

36:43.300 --> 36:44.300
Yeah.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.300
Zach owes me a debit of five luck.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.900
That's exactly right.

36:47.900 --> 36:53.260
So Bradley Cooper, Charles Digby, Walter and Alan Grimes and Angela and Roger Fairfield,

36:53.260 --> 36:59.140
you are all in this meeting room with the walls that round off at all the corners.

36:59.140 --> 37:07.020
And there is these two people, this tall broad woman and this short scrawny man are both

37:07.020 --> 37:12.320
on the ground and you're holding one of the bottles and the other bottle is across the

37:12.320 --> 37:16.060
floor and it's been opened and it is just like in the corner.

37:16.460 --> 37:19.340
It's spilling out of the room.

37:19.340 --> 37:24.500
I want to spray the guy next to me in the face and fucking book it out of the room.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.500
Okay.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.500
What's everybody else doing?

37:26.500 --> 37:29.700
Is Angela being there a thing?

37:29.700 --> 37:30.700
Yeah.

37:30.700 --> 37:31.700
We'll see.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.420
I pass.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.420
No.

37:37.420 --> 37:38.420
It's not a thing.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.420
Okay.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.420
Hey, Angela.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.180
Hey, Raj.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.180
This is crazy.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.580
We need to get the fuck out of this room.

37:44.580 --> 37:46.260
I feel like I was just coming to see you.

37:46.260 --> 37:47.260
That's weird.

37:47.260 --> 37:48.260
Yeah.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.260
I think we got to get out of here.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.260
Right?

37:50.260 --> 37:54.100
You're looking at me, but Martin Cupertino has fled.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.100
Yes.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.100
Real quick.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.780
What are the Grimes doing and what is Charles Digby doing?

37:57.780 --> 37:59.220
I look at Alan.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.220
What is he doing?

38:00.220 --> 38:05.180
He's shaking his head back and forth and his jowls are just flopping about, little bits

38:05.180 --> 38:11.740
of spittle are going everywhere as he's just very confused about what's going on.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.020
I'm going to just wait there for a second.

38:14.020 --> 38:17.140
You're going to what?

38:17.140 --> 38:18.140
Just wait there for a second.

38:18.140 --> 38:19.140
Okay.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.140
Charles Digby.

38:20.140 --> 38:21.300
I think I'm going to book it with Martin.

38:21.300 --> 38:26.060
As soon as you guys get to the door, the door opens and Jack Russell is standing there,

38:26.060 --> 38:31.820
short stout man, and he's like, we need to get the fuck out of here immediately.

38:31.820 --> 38:33.220
Are you kidding me?

38:33.220 --> 38:34.220
What?

38:34.220 --> 38:35.220
I think you got him.

38:35.220 --> 38:36.220
You got him.

38:36.220 --> 38:41.020
I'm glad he said that because I was about to spray him in the face.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.020
What happened when-

38:42.020 --> 38:46.580
You hold the bottle up and I'm like, if you're with, that's actually hilarious.

38:46.580 --> 38:49.780
If you're with them, I'm going to spray your ass down right now.

38:49.780 --> 38:53.820
His hands go straight up in the air and he's like, no, Mike, there's no way that I'm with

38:53.820 --> 38:54.820
him.

38:54.820 --> 38:55.820
I'm trying to-

38:55.820 --> 38:56.820
I believe you.

38:56.820 --> 38:57.820
I found your go hole.

38:57.820 --> 38:58.820
You didn't have a bag, really.

38:58.820 --> 39:10.420
You didn't have a go bag, but you had a hole full of supplies underneath my floorboards.

39:10.420 --> 39:11.980
I put my hand in the hole.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.700
Do you have the syringe?

39:13.700 --> 39:17.020
No, I forgot about that the first time.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.020
Check your pockets.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.020
Check your pockets.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.020
See what you brought with you.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.020
I check my pockets.

39:21.020 --> 39:22.020
You have the syringe.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.020
It pokes you and you die.

39:23.020 --> 39:24.020
Oh, yep, there it is.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.020
Ow!

39:25.020 --> 39:26.020
I do.

39:26.020 --> 39:27.020
Did that peak horribly?

39:27.020 --> 39:28.020
Probably.

39:28.020 --> 39:29.020
Say ow again.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.020
I check my pockets.

39:30.020 --> 39:31.020
Ow!

39:31.020 --> 39:32.020
Yeah, I have it.

39:32.020 --> 39:40.380
No, I probably didn't peak the first time.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.980
What happened when he sprayed the guy?

39:42.980 --> 39:43.980
Literally nothing.

39:43.980 --> 39:49.680
Those people are blank, and when they fell, they just kind of stayed down.

39:49.680 --> 39:55.820
But when you look over at them now, they're slowly getting back up with just a look of

39:55.820 --> 39:57.220
nothing on their faces.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.980
Are they getting up like people get up, or are they getting up in-

39:59.980 --> 40:02.020
They're getting up like people get up.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.180
I don't recognize these people at all, do I?

40:04.180 --> 40:09.100
You would just recognize them from this weird out of place memory that you have of being

40:09.100 --> 40:10.960
in cottage number 11.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.320
These aren't the same attendants who we've seen before?

40:14.320 --> 40:20.700
They were the same attendants that you saw in cottage 11 who sprayed Walter Grimes.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.660
Are they getting up kind of like on their hands and knees?

40:23.660 --> 40:27.680
I'll describe how they get up just to really put it down there.

40:27.680 --> 40:31.740
So they're both on the ground, and they both put their palms on the ground-

40:31.740 --> 40:32.740
In a weird way?

40:32.740 --> 40:33.740
Like people do?

40:33.740 --> 40:36.820
And then slowly move their feet up toward their palms.

40:37.540 --> 40:38.540
Oh, okay.

40:38.540 --> 40:40.380
So just like a normal person would.

40:40.380 --> 40:41.380
Exactly.

40:41.380 --> 40:45.260
And then once their feet and palms are both like next to each other, then they slowly

40:45.260 --> 40:50.620
remove their palms and release towards the sky while exhaling.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.820
Listener Zach is on the floor doing all this.

40:53.820 --> 40:54.820
Doing yoga in front of us.

40:54.820 --> 40:55.820
And it looks exactly like how a human looks.

40:55.820 --> 40:59.060
I got a lot of mic for this one.

40:59.060 --> 41:04.100
So as they're doing that, I want to go over to the guy, and while he's like still hands

41:04.100 --> 41:11.420
on the ground, I want to get behind him and put my hand under his jaw and try to rip.

41:11.420 --> 41:13.580
Good call.

41:13.580 --> 41:17.740
As if maybe it's a removable face.

41:17.740 --> 41:18.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:18.740 --> 41:19.740
No, I get it.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.740
Exactly.

41:20.740 --> 41:23.900
We all got where you're going with that.

41:23.900 --> 41:27.620
Okay, roll unarmed combat.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.620
Unfaced combat.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.620
Fail.

41:30.620 --> 41:33.020
90 on a 49.

41:33.020 --> 41:39.980
Yeah, as you put your hand underneath his jaw, he grabs onto your hand and begins to

41:39.980 --> 41:42.740
slowly move it away from his face.

41:42.740 --> 41:44.900
And he turns around to face you.

41:44.900 --> 41:49.020
And he holds up his hand like he has a spray bottle in it, but he doesn't.

41:49.020 --> 41:53.020
And he's trying to like moving his fingers like he's spraying you in the face.

41:53.020 --> 41:55.020
Okay, I'm going to run away.

41:55.020 --> 41:58.860
Hey, real quick, how do you have a 49?

41:58.860 --> 42:01.860
I have a 55 now.

42:02.700 --> 42:03.700
Whoa.

42:03.700 --> 42:04.700
I don't...

42:04.700 --> 42:05.700
Okay.

42:05.700 --> 42:10.060
Zach gave you some fun mechanics.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.660
Luke asks, and I like to say yes.

42:12.660 --> 42:13.900
All right, so...

42:13.900 --> 42:19.060
Can I get better at beating people up every time I don't beat someone up?

42:19.060 --> 42:21.060
Yeah, sure.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.060
Why not?

42:22.060 --> 42:23.060
Zach, I would like that too.

42:23.060 --> 42:25.900
This story won't go that long, probably.

42:25.900 --> 42:28.980
All right, so what does everyone know?

42:28.980 --> 42:31.300
I mean, these two aren't going to be an issue, right?

42:31.300 --> 42:37.820
And so, and then he looks up and his eyes cross Angela's and his eyes get really big

42:37.820 --> 42:38.820
and he's like...

42:38.820 --> 42:41.420
I'm so sorry.

42:41.420 --> 42:49.780
I just noticed the bottle of hand sanitizer that we have in front of us as a very sassy

42:49.780 --> 42:51.200
like font.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.300
And it says, what did you touch?

42:53.300 --> 42:58.300
Oh my God.

42:58.300 --> 42:59.700
What did you touch?

42:59.700 --> 43:00.700
What did you touch?

43:00.700 --> 43:07.700
Which is exactly what Jack Russell says to Angela Fairfield.

43:07.700 --> 43:08.700
What did you touch, honey?

43:08.700 --> 43:09.700
What did you touch?

43:09.700 --> 43:12.700
What did you touch?

43:12.700 --> 43:17.140
Honey, what did you touch?

43:17.140 --> 43:21.860
And she begins backing away slowly from everyone.

43:21.860 --> 43:24.540
Honey, you all right, Angie?

43:24.540 --> 43:26.060
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

43:26.060 --> 43:27.380
I'm confused though.

43:27.380 --> 43:30.620
Is everyone cool here?

43:30.620 --> 43:31.620
What has happened?

43:31.620 --> 43:32.620
Are you guys good?

43:32.620 --> 43:33.620
Yeah, we're cool.

43:33.620 --> 43:34.620
Are you cool?

43:34.620 --> 43:35.620
Do you have any weed?

43:35.620 --> 43:37.620
I feel like we never got to the bottom of that.

43:37.620 --> 43:39.220
Oh, we got to the bottom of it.

43:39.220 --> 43:40.580
Do you have anything on your hand?

43:40.580 --> 43:41.580
I brought weed.

43:41.580 --> 43:42.580
Yeah, it's no big deal.

43:42.580 --> 43:43.580
Will you pass me a J?

43:43.580 --> 43:44.580
Is this the time?

43:44.580 --> 43:48.340
Yeah, canonically, I just kind of want to get this done.

43:48.340 --> 43:49.340
Okay.

43:49.340 --> 43:52.740
And she just reaches into her little clutch and throws you a joint.

43:52.740 --> 43:56.860
Okay, I'm going to add a syringe and a joint to my inventory.

43:57.860 --> 43:58.860
The classics.

43:58.860 --> 43:59.860
Yep.

44:02.860 --> 44:03.860
Woof.

44:03.860 --> 44:08.340
Can I roll human to see if something's fucky with her?

44:08.340 --> 44:09.340
Yes.

44:09.340 --> 44:10.340
Can I do that too?

44:10.340 --> 44:11.340
Yes.

44:11.340 --> 44:14.140
Do we all even see her?

44:14.140 --> 44:15.140
Yes.

44:15.140 --> 44:16.140
Okay.

44:16.140 --> 44:17.140
I passed my human troll.

44:17.140 --> 44:18.140
I failed.

44:18.140 --> 44:22.540
Charles Digby, you know that she is extremely nervous and confused.

44:22.540 --> 44:23.540
Okay.

44:23.540 --> 44:25.540
Honey, you seem nervous and confused.

44:26.220 --> 44:28.740
Why don't you come with us?

44:28.740 --> 44:29.740
Yeah.

44:29.740 --> 44:32.380
Yeah, no, I'll come with you guys.

44:32.380 --> 44:35.460
Do you guys remember if she was with us the last time?

44:35.460 --> 44:36.820
What are you talking about?

44:36.820 --> 44:37.820
Of course.

44:37.820 --> 44:38.820
In the cabin?

44:38.820 --> 44:40.100
She wasn't with us in the cabin.

44:40.100 --> 44:41.100
Out of character.

44:41.100 --> 44:42.100
Yeah, she was not.

44:42.100 --> 44:43.100
Out of character.

44:43.100 --> 44:44.100
No, I was asking in character.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.100
Yeah, in character.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.100
What the fuck is going on?

44:46.100 --> 44:48.100
What are you guys talking about when you're in the cab?

44:48.100 --> 44:50.580
We've just been waiting for James.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.580
Waiting for James.

44:51.580 --> 44:52.580
Is that all you think you've done here?

44:52.620 --> 44:58.100
Well, I do remember James came in, and then I thought that you left with him, and then

44:58.100 --> 44:59.820
I was going to come and get you, and then you...

44:59.820 --> 45:03.660
No, we were all just waiting for him to come in because we're having another meeting.

45:03.660 --> 45:06.780
I think we need to run now and talk about this later.

45:06.780 --> 45:08.380
Yeah, we're going to run.

45:08.380 --> 45:10.060
You can come with us if you want.

45:10.060 --> 45:11.180
We're going with Jack Russell.

45:11.180 --> 45:12.180
Roger, come with us.

45:12.180 --> 45:13.180
Yeah, yeah.

45:13.180 --> 45:16.100
Wait, but you said we were waiting for James to come in.

45:16.100 --> 45:18.200
Yeah, we were waiting for James.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.260
So he hasn't come in yet.

45:19.260 --> 45:21.020
That means that maybe he's coming.

45:21.020 --> 45:22.980
Why don't you stay here and find out?

45:22.980 --> 45:23.980
Roger, come.

45:23.980 --> 45:25.140
We need to go now.

45:25.140 --> 45:26.140
And I grab him.

45:26.140 --> 45:30.100
I pat him on the shoulder, like, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's

45:30.100 --> 45:31.100
go.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.100
Honey, come on.

45:32.100 --> 45:33.100
We should follow them.

45:33.100 --> 45:35.020
Yeah, okay, but what are we doing?

45:35.020 --> 45:36.700
Why are we leaving?

45:36.700 --> 45:37.700
There's something wrong.

45:37.700 --> 45:39.700
There's something wrong.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.860
They're spray bottles, and they're...

45:41.860 --> 45:48.460
Zuhur Ilknei, Zuhur Ilknei, Zuhur Ilknei, Bradley Cooper, Charles Jacobi, Walter and

45:48.460 --> 45:54.540
Alan Grimes, and Roger Fairfield, you are all sitting in a half circle facing a single

45:54.540 --> 45:58.740
empty chair in the meeting room where you had orientation.

45:58.740 --> 46:00.900
Everyone roll Constitution.

46:00.900 --> 46:02.940
Except for Bradley, who crit.

46:02.940 --> 46:05.780
Oh, well, he just passed again.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.420
59 on a 60.

46:07.420 --> 46:08.420
Nice.

46:08.420 --> 46:09.420
Fail.

46:09.420 --> 46:11.820
I pass a 14 on a 70.

46:11.820 --> 46:15.620
Okay, everyone take your headphones off except for Justin.

46:15.620 --> 46:16.620
Yay.

46:16.740 --> 46:18.580
Don't hurt me too bad, Zai.

46:18.580 --> 46:26.260
Okay, Justin, I need you to play on this one like you don't remember like anything from

46:26.260 --> 46:30.980
all of these confusing plot points like you just got here and everything's normal.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
Cool.

46:31.980 --> 46:32.980
You ready for that?

46:32.980 --> 46:33.980
So like I just first arrived?

46:33.980 --> 46:35.980
Yeah, like you're fresh and ready to go.

46:35.980 --> 46:36.980
Right, okay.

46:36.980 --> 46:38.340
Okay, everybody back.

46:38.340 --> 46:39.620
It's weird.

46:39.620 --> 46:42.740
It's weird how well that works.

46:42.740 --> 46:48.300
The listener can't see us, but usually we go out of the room when it's short, Zach just

46:48.300 --> 46:51.860
has us take our headphones off and then we just like press our ears.

46:51.860 --> 46:52.860
Ear flap?

46:52.860 --> 46:53.860
What do you call that part?

46:53.860 --> 46:54.860
Yeah, right.

46:54.860 --> 46:55.860
It has a name.

46:55.860 --> 46:56.860
Tragus.

46:56.860 --> 46:57.860
I'm sorry, whoa, what is it?

46:57.860 --> 46:58.860
Tragus.

46:58.860 --> 46:59.860
A tragus.

46:59.860 --> 47:00.860
Ear anatomy.

47:00.860 --> 47:05.980
If you just slam your tragus on both sides, you get a roar in your ear.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.180
Oh, okay.

47:07.180 --> 47:08.180
Can you guys?

47:08.180 --> 47:09.980
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

47:09.980 --> 47:10.980
Ear rumble?

47:10.980 --> 47:11.980
Oh, the ear rumble, yeah.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.060
I didn't know everybody couldn't do that.

47:14.060 --> 47:16.700
I think most people can because- It's called the tragus.

47:16.700 --> 47:19.700
Yep, that's what I said.

47:19.700 --> 47:21.420
You're acting like Luke.

47:21.420 --> 47:23.660
Good job, Luke.

47:23.660 --> 47:24.660
We both are right all the time.

47:24.660 --> 47:25.660
Thanks.

47:25.660 --> 47:27.660
I've got both my mind pierced, so that's how I know.

47:27.660 --> 47:28.660
Oh.

47:28.660 --> 47:31.020
You can't tell because I have headphones on.

47:31.020 --> 47:32.620
Did you actually in the past get your tragus?

47:32.620 --> 47:34.260
No, I've never had anything pierced.

47:34.260 --> 47:35.260
Anything?

47:35.260 --> 47:39.340
My PA, I've got a Prince Albert, but that's it.

47:39.340 --> 47:41.540
You would look really good with some piercings.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.100
I thought you were going to say it with a Prince Albert.

47:44.100 --> 47:46.100
You would look so hot.

47:46.100 --> 47:50.500
Obviously, everybody would look great with a Prince Albert.

47:50.500 --> 47:55.180
I just think Luke could really rock some funky tragus piercings.

47:55.180 --> 47:57.580
I don't think if I got anything pierced, it wouldn't-

47:57.580 --> 47:59.580
It would be your dingus.

47:59.580 --> 48:01.580
I don't know what I would get.

48:01.580 --> 48:02.580
Your dingus.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.580
We'll think about it later.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.020
I'll let you know at the end of the episode.

48:05.020 --> 48:06.580
So you guys are sitting in this room.

48:06.580 --> 48:07.620
It's just you guys.

48:07.620 --> 48:10.860
The spray bottles aren't in here, the two people aren't in here.

48:10.860 --> 48:12.100
Angela's not in here.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.940
How's our memory working right now?

48:13.940 --> 48:16.700
Do we remember spray bottle guys in the room?

48:16.700 --> 48:17.900
You do, but they're not here.

48:17.900 --> 48:18.940
This place sucks.

48:18.940 --> 48:20.900
Why did you guys come here if it sucks?

48:20.900 --> 48:23.140
Aren't we all coming here to get better?

48:23.140 --> 48:24.820
Angela wanted us to get better, yeah.

48:24.820 --> 48:25.820
That's good.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.820
Yeah, I-

48:26.820 --> 48:27.820
What?

48:27.820 --> 48:28.820
Wait a minute.

48:28.820 --> 48:29.820
What?

48:29.820 --> 48:30.820
What are you so-

48:30.820 --> 48:31.820
What?

48:31.820 --> 48:32.820
Why are you so protective of this place and its agenda?

48:32.820 --> 48:33.820
What agenda are you guys talking about?

48:33.820 --> 48:34.820
I'm not talking about an agenda.

48:34.820 --> 48:36.420
I thought we were just here for therapy.

48:36.420 --> 48:38.140
You've seen what's happened here.

48:38.140 --> 48:39.140
Don't you remember?

48:39.140 --> 48:40.820
Charles Digby's getting scared.

48:40.820 --> 48:41.820
What's going on?

48:41.820 --> 48:42.820
Do you not remember?

48:42.820 --> 48:43.820
We were all just here.

48:43.820 --> 48:44.820
But it was different.

48:44.820 --> 48:45.820
Right?

48:45.820 --> 48:46.940
Am I fucking losing my mind here?

48:46.940 --> 48:47.940
I remember that.

48:47.940 --> 48:48.940
Yeah.

48:48.940 --> 48:49.940
I remember.

48:49.940 --> 48:50.940
No, this is my- I just got here.

48:50.940 --> 48:52.940
And this is like our orientation, isn't it?

48:52.940 --> 48:53.940
Or-

48:53.940 --> 48:54.940
Oh, damn it, Digby.

48:54.940 --> 48:55.940
Did they spray you?

48:55.940 --> 48:56.940
Who are you?

48:56.940 --> 48:57.940
I'm Martin Cupertino.

48:57.940 --> 48:59.580
I'm a Silicon Valley billionaire.

48:59.580 --> 49:01.260
Oh, I read about you.

49:01.260 --> 49:02.260
Yeah.

49:02.260 --> 49:04.860
Definitely not taking pictures of people like you before.

49:04.860 --> 49:05.860
I want to go over to-

49:05.860 --> 49:07.500
I am a paparazzo.

49:07.500 --> 49:10.580
And put my hand on his jaw and rip.

49:10.580 --> 49:11.580
You?

49:11.580 --> 49:12.580
On Charles.

49:12.580 --> 49:13.580
See if he's-

49:13.580 --> 49:14.580
Okay.

49:14.580 --> 49:15.580
Well, this young kid-

49:15.580 --> 49:16.580
I contest.

49:16.580 --> 49:18.340
And a Metallica shirt walks up to you.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.340
Hey, what are you doing?

49:19.340 --> 49:20.340
Do we need to do it?

49:20.340 --> 49:21.340
Yeah.

49:21.340 --> 49:22.340
I mean, if he's going for it.

49:22.340 --> 49:23.340
Unarmed combat.

49:23.340 --> 49:24.340
38 on a 55.

49:24.340 --> 49:25.340
Oh, shit.

49:25.340 --> 49:26.340
Uh-oh.

49:26.340 --> 49:27.340
Fuck.

49:27.340 --> 49:28.340
41 on a 60.

49:28.340 --> 49:29.340
Oh, wait.

49:29.340 --> 49:30.340
No, let me do it.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.340
I thought it was below.

49:31.340 --> 49:32.340
You rip his face off.

49:32.340 --> 49:33.340
Yeah.

49:33.340 --> 49:34.340
I kill him.

49:34.340 --> 49:35.340
I kill the boy.

49:35.340 --> 49:47.500
All right, Luke, describe the beginning of what you do, and then we'll let Justin describe

49:47.500 --> 49:49.180
how he combats that.

49:49.180 --> 49:53.780
Like, after he is saying all that, I just kind of look at him weird, and I just stand

49:53.780 --> 49:59.500
straight up, walk right over to him, and with just my pointer finger and thumb right behind

49:59.500 --> 50:01.260
his cheek, just try to-

50:01.260 --> 50:02.260
Yeah.

50:02.260 --> 50:04.580
So at this point in time, what's Charles Digby doing?

50:04.580 --> 50:08.360
I just grab the hand and pull the finger back.

50:08.360 --> 50:11.660
Not break it, but pull it back to be like, what are you doing?

50:11.660 --> 50:12.660
Yes.

50:12.660 --> 50:14.180
Walter, get away from this man.

50:14.180 --> 50:17.080
I don't think we can trust him.

50:17.080 --> 50:18.300
Why can't you guys trust me?

50:18.300 --> 50:21.460
Charles, what's going ... You don't remember anything?

50:21.460 --> 50:24.860
I've never met you guys until today.

50:24.860 --> 50:28.420
Have we already done the true truths and a lie in this room?

50:28.420 --> 50:29.420
Yes.

50:29.420 --> 50:30.420
Well, yeah.

50:30.420 --> 50:33.540
Of course we have, but we've also done a lot of other ... Do you remember when there

50:33.540 --> 50:34.660
were spray bottles?

50:34.660 --> 50:35.660
The spray bottle thing?

50:35.660 --> 50:38.340
No, I don't know what you guys are talking about.

50:38.340 --> 50:41.980
I'm a little ... Maybe I need to go talk to James.

50:41.980 --> 50:43.820
No, no, no, no, no.

50:43.820 --> 50:46.180
I kind of start getting up and walking towards the door.

50:46.180 --> 50:47.180
Father, I'm confused.

50:47.180 --> 50:48.180
Sorry.

50:48.180 --> 50:49.180
We all just made eye contact.

50:49.180 --> 50:50.180
I say, sorry.

50:50.180 --> 50:54.180
I'm trying to tackle you now.

50:54.180 --> 50:55.180
Awesome.

50:55.180 --> 51:03.500
27, not great for a contested unarmed combat role.

51:03.500 --> 51:04.500
He's trying to tackle you.

51:04.500 --> 51:07.860
I don't think I'd notice because I'm walking ... I'm assuming you're tackling me from behind

51:07.860 --> 51:08.860
or something.

51:08.860 --> 51:09.860
Yeah.

51:09.860 --> 51:10.860
So it just happens.

51:10.860 --> 51:11.860
Yeah.

51:11.860 --> 51:12.860
Didn't say how you tackle me.

51:12.860 --> 51:13.860
Yeah.

51:13.860 --> 51:15.820
What's his body feel like on your body?

51:15.820 --> 51:16.980
What's your body look like?

51:16.980 --> 51:17.980
Average.

51:17.980 --> 51:21.860
It feels like an average.

51:21.860 --> 51:23.660
Average sort of tackle.

51:23.660 --> 51:26.180
It doesn't feel like the NFL or anything.

51:26.180 --> 51:27.180
That's good.

51:27.180 --> 51:29.920
It's small compared to that because he's average.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.720
As this is happening, I look at Roger.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.240
What was your wife saying?

51:34.240 --> 51:35.240
Oh yeah.

51:35.240 --> 51:38.760
She was saying ... Can I remember what she was saying?

51:38.760 --> 51:39.760
Role intelligence.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.760
Oh fuck, I fail.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.880
A 78 on a 75.

51:45.880 --> 51:47.600
No, you can't quite remember.

51:47.600 --> 51:51.200
Fuck, neither can Joe.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.200
It was something weird.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.440
It was weird.

51:53.440 --> 51:54.440
It was like a chanting kind of thing.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.320
Have you ever heard that before?

51:56.320 --> 51:58.440
No, never.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.440
Is that the correct answer?

51:59.960 --> 52:00.960
Have I never heard her do that before?

52:00.960 --> 52:01.960
I have no idea.

52:01.960 --> 52:03.960
I don't know you.

52:03.960 --> 52:04.960
Walter, tell me.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.760
Have I heard it before?

52:06.760 --> 52:07.760
You've definitely heard it.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.760
Do you remember Tuesday?

52:09.760 --> 52:13.320
No, you have never heard that before from Angela.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.480
There has to be something in this room that gets us somewhere else.

52:16.480 --> 52:20.520
It was the spray bottle once and then when she chanted that, we came here.

52:20.520 --> 52:21.520
Oh God, no.

52:21.520 --> 52:25.360
It was something strange and I don't ... But now she's not even here and everything-

52:25.360 --> 52:26.360
Yeah.

52:26.360 --> 52:30.160
Hey, buddy, you know your wife's in on this, right?

52:30.160 --> 52:31.160
And she's probably not your wife.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.480
Is she not here with us right now?

52:32.480 --> 52:33.480
No.

52:33.480 --> 52:34.480
Is Martin on top of me while this is happening?

52:34.480 --> 52:35.480
That keeps happening.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.480
Yeah, I'm on top.

52:36.480 --> 52:37.480
I turn around.

52:37.480 --> 52:41.680
Am I like struggling or like ... You didn't say you were, so I just thought

52:41.680 --> 52:42.680
you were lying flat.

52:42.680 --> 52:43.680
He's just admitted.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.680
I'm sorry.

52:44.680 --> 52:46.760
I was just like, I give up.

52:46.760 --> 52:47.760
You got comfy.

52:47.760 --> 52:48.760
I'm sad.

52:48.760 --> 52:51.760
You're like actually the weight of another human being for the first time in a while.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.760
Yeah, it's really nice on my back.

52:52.760 --> 52:53.760
Oh, yeah.

52:53.760 --> 52:55.560
I like getting sat on.

52:55.560 --> 52:57.280
That's why I'm here.

52:57.280 --> 53:00.160
Can I do a search to see if there's anything out of place in this room?

53:00.160 --> 53:01.160
You can.

53:01.160 --> 53:04.000
10 on a 43.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.400
Nothing is out of place in this room except for maybe that Angela Fairfield isn't here.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.560
Is anything two in place?

53:10.560 --> 53:13.800
I don't know what that means.

53:13.800 --> 53:15.880
You actually looked at me like you were going to let me roll?

53:15.880 --> 53:16.880
Yeah.

53:16.880 --> 53:17.880
So maybe that's exactly what it is.

53:17.880 --> 53:18.880
You can roll.

53:18.880 --> 53:19.880
64.

53:19.880 --> 53:20.880
No.

53:20.880 --> 53:25.480
Oh, then you don't learn the cool thing.

53:25.480 --> 53:31.280
Can I struggle to get up or am I like, did you tackle me from behind or are you just

53:31.280 --> 53:32.280
like-

53:32.280 --> 53:33.280
Yeah, I've got you pinned, I think.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.280
I've got you.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.280
Yeah.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.280
Can I try and, is there like a struggle mechanic?

53:36.280 --> 53:37.280
Yeah.

53:37.280 --> 53:39.280
I mean, it's unarmed combat.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.280
Oh, okay.

53:40.280 --> 53:41.280
Yeah.

53:41.280 --> 53:42.280
Do I have advantage because I've pinned him?

53:42.280 --> 53:43.280
You do.

53:43.280 --> 53:44.280
You have a plus 20.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.280
Fuck.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.400
Oh, I didn't pass.

53:48.400 --> 53:49.400
I did pass.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.400
I'm like-

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
How do you keep him down?

53:51.400 --> 53:54.760
46 on a modified 90.

53:55.080 --> 53:56.080
Yeah.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.480
No, like with no apparent effort.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.480
Yeah.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
I've just got him pinned.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.520
Comfortably in a pressure lock.

54:02.520 --> 54:05.920
And I'm still just turned around like, you know your wife's not real, right?

54:05.920 --> 54:07.360
Half the time she's not even here.

54:07.360 --> 54:12.820
I'm doing the thing where the only thing that's moving is my neck and I'm like, but no part

54:12.820 --> 54:15.200
of my muscles are moving.

54:15.200 --> 54:20.280
One of my arms is pinning you down, but another one is gently rubbing your back, just trying

54:20.280 --> 54:23.080
to calm you down like a pig or something.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.840
Now I'm more confused.

54:24.840 --> 54:25.840
I'm like, what?

54:25.840 --> 54:26.840
I don't-

54:26.840 --> 54:28.040
I'm just trying to temple grand in you.

54:28.040 --> 54:29.840
I'll just squeeze you.

54:29.840 --> 54:30.840
Calm me down.

54:30.840 --> 54:34.080
While this is happening, I'm just going around touching everything in the room.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.080
Okay.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.080
I feel you just like touch my chin.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.080
I'm like, what the fuck?

54:38.080 --> 54:44.560
Roger, when Martin is on top of Charles Digby and he's looking at you saying that your wife

54:44.560 --> 54:47.200
isn't real, how are you responding?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.400
Of course she's real.

54:48.400 --> 54:49.400
She's my wife.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
I don't understand.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.160
I don't understand how she wouldn't be-

54:52.240 --> 54:54.080
I feel like we've seen you go through this before.

54:54.080 --> 54:57.400
The door opens and Angela is standing there.

54:57.400 --> 54:58.400
See there.

54:58.400 --> 54:59.400
Hey guys.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.600
Hey Angela, are you really his wife?

55:00.600 --> 55:02.880
Her eyes get really big.

55:02.880 --> 55:03.880
Yeah.

55:03.880 --> 55:04.880
Why?

55:04.880 --> 55:08.360
I'd like to humant that.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.360
Roll humant.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.360
Oh shit.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.360
Uh, fail.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.360
Yeah.

55:12.360 --> 55:13.360
85 on a 60.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.680
I don't understand the line of questioning, honey.

55:15.680 --> 55:16.680
I don't either, Angie.

55:16.680 --> 55:17.680
Where's this going, Martin?

55:17.680 --> 55:18.680
Come on, man.

55:18.680 --> 55:19.680
She's never here.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.160
I mean, sometimes she is, but like when shit goes down.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.520
Why are you on top of-

55:23.520 --> 55:24.520
Martin?

55:24.520 --> 55:27.880
I thought you were Brad Lee Cooper.

55:27.880 --> 55:31.880
Brad Lee Cooper.

55:31.880 --> 55:32.880
That's right.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.480
Angela, help.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.600
Go get James and get me out of here.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.600
What's happening right now?

55:40.600 --> 55:42.200
I didn't come here to be treated like this.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.720
This is supposed to be a nice calm-

55:43.720 --> 55:44.720
Oh, that's right.

55:44.720 --> 55:47.000
That's why I'm on you because you wanted to get James.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Yeah, actually-

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Angela.

55:49.320 --> 55:53.800
She takes one step back and shuts the door and she's on the other side of it.

55:53.800 --> 55:54.800
Angie?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
Yeah.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
Yeah.

56:49.040 --> 56:54.040
I'm tired of coming.

56:54.040 --> 57:00.040
I think that you could fall.

57:00.040 --> 57:08.040
I knew I'd make you believe.

57:08.040 --> 57:12.040
Cooler than you could lose me.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.040
Yeah.

57:49.040 --> 57:54.040
Now I think you could swallow me.

57:54.040 --> 58:01.040
Corner room in at least right.

58:01.040 --> 58:05.040
Corner in at least right.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.040
Yeah.

58:49.040 --> 58:50.040
Yeah.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.040
Yeah.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.040
Yeah.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.040
Yeah.

58:53.040 --> 58:53.040
