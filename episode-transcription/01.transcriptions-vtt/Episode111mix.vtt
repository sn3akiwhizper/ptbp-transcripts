00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
Welcome, my sour-creamy children.

00:02.840 --> 00:05.840
It's your yogurt craftsman, Wolf the Dog,

00:05.840 --> 00:10.640
and I'm here to leave out all the cream until it becomes art.

00:10.640 --> 00:16.320
Then I shall venture to the farmer's market to sell my wares by the barrel.

00:16.320 --> 00:21.960
I'm about to flood this farmer's market with that thick, nasty artisanal cream.

00:21.960 --> 00:28.240
I'm warming up all the sour milk live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:28.240 --> 00:34.840
the only yogurt creamery and, uh, radio station, I think.

00:34.840 --> 00:39.320
Speaking of that good cream, we got a new Howlin' with Wolf.

00:39.320 --> 00:44.160
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Van Gogh's ear in Alberta, Canada,

00:44.160 --> 00:47.800
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:47.800 --> 00:53.680
which is one of the ways you can be chosen to write up a Howlin' with Wolf for this old wolf to howl.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.160
He writes,

00:55.160 --> 00:58.080
No ooze is good ooze.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.320
All cops are bastards.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.120
And all dogs go to heaven.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.520
Things fell apart.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.200
The sinner couldn't hold.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.840
The Stygian tide is loosed and everywhere.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.280
The ceremony of innocence is overcome.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.320
And what eldritch beast?

01:15.320 --> 01:17.920
It's our come round at last.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.240
Slouches toward contention to be born?

01:21.280 --> 01:26.600
Shout out to Irish Chris and Elena the Good Witch of the Midwest.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.960
Season one has been squamously good.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.840
We can't wait for season two.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.560
Thanks for all the creepin' terror, PTB crew.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.520
Damn Van Gogh's ear.

01:37.520 --> 01:43.440
I didn't know ears knew such fancy words and could compose poems or whatever.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.880
That's awesome for you, I bet.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.480
One time, I wrote a poem for a past lover.

01:49.520 --> 01:55.040
It was mainly just the letter E, but they got what I was puttin' down.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.560
It, uh, it was sexy talk is what I was puttin' down.

02:00.560 --> 02:05.120
And I just wanna let y'all know, not all dogs get into heaven.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.880
Only a very small percentage of them actually do.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.440
Weird, right?

02:10.440 --> 02:14.000
If you wanna write up somethin' like Van Gogh's ear here,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.720
then listen to me very carefully.

02:16.760 --> 02:22.320
Write a five-star review for this five-star show on Apple Podcasts.

02:22.320 --> 02:28.480
Then y'all should go and tag at Pretendin' Pod on all them damn social media things.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.880
Then come on down to the subreddit and Discord too, why don't ya?

02:32.880 --> 02:34.880
Two more cool things.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.720
First, my producer released a trailer for season one of Pretending to be People.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.360
If I had a YouTube, I'd definitely look at it.

02:44.360 --> 02:51.080
So what I need y'all to do is to look at it and then share it with all your internet buddies.

02:51.080 --> 03:00.440
Next up, the 24th bonus episode over on Patreon is comin' out sooner than my cream starts curdlin' on a hot summer's day.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.800
After y'all caught up with the creature crew,

03:03.800 --> 03:10.880
join them PTBP friends Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Central Time in the Den of Sin.

03:10.920 --> 03:15.240
For the conclusion of the mission in Moja.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.040
Apparently that's a place where spooky things can happen,

03:19.040 --> 03:22.480
but y'all gotta check the Patreon to find that out.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.320
Are there links for all that sloppin' more?

03:25.320 --> 03:26.640
Why, yes.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.840
Where are they?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.600
They're in the show notes.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.520
Just click on the thingy that shows you them damn show notes.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.600
Do it for Wolfie, my babies.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.720
I'm makin' puppy dog eyes at ya.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.960
And now I'm doin' this for y'all.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.800
It's the gosh dang news.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.520
Last time, I gave over the power, relinquished the duty,

03:49.520 --> 03:53.480
forwent the honor of presenting the news.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.720
But this time, you know what's goin' on.

03:56.720 --> 04:04.280
Planet Juggernaut just crushed all of the Giganticumbic Hyrthpicithis' hopes and dreams with the fastball.

04:04.280 --> 04:09.400
Took out the horde of incoming goo-drenched snatchy skeletons,

04:09.400 --> 04:14.360
and turned it into a curveball-gotcha-tongue situation.

04:14.360 --> 04:19.480
You're sweet and sourly mistaken if you're lookin' for Dragon in 2.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.120
This is Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

04:34.280 --> 04:38.280
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline,

04:38.280 --> 04:42.280
leavin' my mind at your altar,

04:42.280 --> 04:46.280
crossin' the double line, doin' it every time.

04:46.280 --> 04:52.280
Tell me What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

04:54.280 --> 05:00.280
What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

05:04.280 --> 05:12.280
Wow, wow, wow, come on down, everybody!

05:12.280 --> 05:17.280
It's Nick Meckles and I'm here with my brother, Nick Meckles!

05:17.280 --> 05:20.280
Is that the energy we wanna start with?

05:20.280 --> 05:23.280
Nick Meckles! Nick Meckles!

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
Yeah, sorry Justin, are you not amped up enough?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
Oh, do we need to amp you up?

05:27.280 --> 05:28.280
I need to be amped up.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
Okay, let's get the energy going.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.280
Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.

05:32.280 --> 05:36.280
Justin, Justin, he's our man. If he can't do it, no one can.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
It's Nick Meckles time!

05:37.280 --> 05:42.280
Oh, everybody! It's Nick Goddamn Meckles!

05:47.280 --> 05:51.280
Round three and we're at the top of this, motherfucker.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.280
What do you think about that, Nick Meckles?

05:53.280 --> 05:57.280
I'm just surprised we're still standing here at our little,

05:57.280 --> 06:00.280
I guess, are we at like a little television desk?

06:00.280 --> 06:03.280
No, we're standing on either side of Keith Vigna,

06:03.280 --> 06:06.280
who's crying deeply into the ground and his hands.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.280
I've got one microphone in his face,

06:08.280 --> 06:10.280
you've got the other microphone in his face,

06:10.280 --> 06:13.280
which means that we have four microphones between the two of us.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.280
That's quite amazing.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.280
I love that we found these extra microphones

06:16.280 --> 06:18.280
in this extra dimensional plane.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.280
Well, they're everywhere when we're around

06:20.280 --> 06:22.280
and we're gonna go right to the business!

06:22.280 --> 06:23.280
Oh my God!

06:23.280 --> 06:25.280
Let's look up at that.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.280
Do you see the big, gigantic,

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
Gigant Umbropithecus right there,

06:29.280 --> 06:31.280
the big guy who's being swung around,

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
Planet Juggernaut's got his tongue swinging around

06:33.280 --> 06:36.280
like Luke Skywalker in Empire Strikes Back.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.280
Do you see that?

06:38.280 --> 06:40.280
I do see that.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.280
Well, that guy is right up there!

06:43.280 --> 06:46.280
The Gigant Umbropithecus reaches down

06:46.280 --> 06:53.280
and takes another massive swipe across the land at the Liturgy.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.280
Am I using that right? At the...

06:55.280 --> 06:57.280
Yeah!

06:57.280 --> 07:04.280
And so another chunk of this crooning group of chanters.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.280
Zach, it would be really asinine to stop you right now

07:07.280 --> 07:10.280
just for a minor definition quibble.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.280
That would be insane.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.280
I liked it. I liked learning.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.280
Love it.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.280
I like learning, and this is a illuminated land,

07:20.280 --> 07:23.280
the Liturgy that I'm learning about.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.280
About half of them straight up get consumed

07:26.280 --> 07:30.280
into the forearm of this enormous beast

07:30.280 --> 07:33.280
as it swipes across at this group.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.280
And I was thinking about it, and I thought,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.280
you know, we already rolled for, gosh, so many people.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.280
We rolled for the Old West people.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.280
We rolled for Jack Perlman.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.280
Oh!

07:45.280 --> 07:47.280
We rolled for Drew Andrews.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.280
We rolled for Councilwoman Carrie Pages.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.280
We rolled for Harry Clinker, Everett Pace,

07:51.280 --> 07:53.280
Mildred Mitchell, Gary Daley, Jimmy Sanders,

07:53.280 --> 07:54.280
Professor Horace Green.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.280
We rolled for a lot of people as well as a lot of pets.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.280
And to put you guys through that again,

08:00.280 --> 08:03.280
I thought might be super duper fun.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.280
Let's go.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.280
So basically what we're gonna do is,

08:11.280 --> 08:15.280
as this enormous towering beast that's just oozing,

08:15.280 --> 08:18.280
forming and reforming its tongue,

08:18.280 --> 08:20.280
hanging out with Planet Juggernaut

08:20.280 --> 08:23.280
at the end of this black ooze that it's held onto.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.280
It swings around him.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.280
And because Planet Juggernaut has this thing's tongue,

08:28.280 --> 08:31.280
we're gonna take a negative 20%.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.280
This thing will take a negative 20%.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.280
So this time, we're gonna roll for some more NPCs,

08:37.280 --> 08:39.280
whether or not they live

08:39.280 --> 08:41.280
or whether or not they will be consumed,

08:41.280 --> 08:46.280
and they each have a good 30% chance of non-existence,

08:46.280 --> 08:51.280
which means a 70% chance of survival, which is big.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
So I will start.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.280
I will go ahead and roll the first one

08:54.280 --> 08:58.280
because we have just enough NPCs left for everyone

08:58.280 --> 09:00.280
to have their own to roll for.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.280
So I'm gonna start with Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.280
So you see this very tall, very buff woman

09:09.280 --> 09:12.280
dressed like she's in the Old West still.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.280
She's got just insanely strong thighs.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.280
And when you look at the thighs, you think to yourself-

09:17.280 --> 09:19.280
Watermelon busting hips.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
Yep.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
100%.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.280
And shout out to M from Michigan for giving us this NPC-

09:25.280 --> 09:26.280
To maybe murder.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.280
$10 level on Patreon.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.280
You can write up an NPC.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.280
They will kill.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
Yeah.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.280
So if it is a 30 or under-

09:35.280 --> 09:36.280
They die?

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
Yep.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
95.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
Safe.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
Sweet life.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Next up is Thomas.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Thomas, I need you to roll

09:42.280 --> 09:46.280
as we see the janitor of the First Church of Contention.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.280
He has a pencil-thin mustache and a mullet.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.280
Casey Kristoff.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.280
His beard gut is spilling out of his Van Halen t-shirt

09:54.280 --> 09:56.280
all over his cutoff shorts,

09:56.280 --> 09:58.280
his outfit of choice for the past 30 years,

09:58.280 --> 10:01.280
and he is missing a hand.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.280
Spilling out all over his jorts

10:04.280 --> 10:08.280
is a disgusting and amazing description.

10:08.280 --> 10:11.280
And thankful for that description.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.280
I am, and you are, and we are,

10:13.280 --> 10:16.280
to B. Weldon from Salt Lake City,

10:16.280 --> 10:19.280
who wrote up Casey Kristoff for us.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
I wear some of his underwear.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.280
To 100?

10:21.280 --> 10:22.280
Yep.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.280
Thomas, 30 or under, and he gone.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.280
42.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.280
Oh, that's a liver.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.280
That's a liver.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.280
That's a liver.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.280
Luke, I need you to roll for a man of average height.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.280
He has dirty overalls and boots,

10:37.280 --> 10:40.280
a trucker cap with long, oily hair

10:40.280 --> 10:42.280
flowing out the bottom of it,

10:42.280 --> 10:44.280
and a lip packed with chew,

10:44.280 --> 10:46.280
the scent of booze on his breath,

10:46.280 --> 10:49.280
oil-stained hands, and a ripped flannel.

10:49.280 --> 10:52.280
You got your $3 back from Terence Liquor.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
Yep.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.280
Now let's see.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.280
I hope he dies.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.280
Oh!

10:59.280 --> 11:01.280
He's dead as fuck.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
It's a 29.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.280
It's a 29 as Terence Liquor looks up

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
at the very end of his life.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.280
Literally, in my imagination,

11:11.280 --> 11:13.280
the ooze must have taken him

11:13.280 --> 11:16.280
as he was still just laying in the yard of Randy Yanks,

11:16.280 --> 11:20.280
and so he has almost no time to come to his senses here

11:20.280 --> 11:24.280
in this dark, luminous, landed plane of existence.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.280
He had a bad day.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.280
And he can't even remember what his voice sounds like

11:31.280 --> 11:35.280
as he dissipates into the arm ooze

11:35.280 --> 11:37.280
of this gigantic umbropithecus.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.280
Probably kind of ambiguously southern.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
Yeah.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.280
If I had to guess.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.280
That's a good guess, yeah.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.280
Shout-out to B. Crever for that lost life.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.280
Thank you for making Terence Liquor.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.280
What a joy it was to have him in the game.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.280
And next we have Joe.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.280
I would like you to roll for an attractive woman

11:56.280 --> 11:57.280
from the city,

11:57.280 --> 12:01.280
and she has a large tortoiseshell glasses,

12:01.280 --> 12:04.280
a full-sleeve tattoo of a robed figure

12:04.280 --> 12:07.280
holding a ball of light on her left arm,

12:07.280 --> 12:10.280
and she always wears blood-red lipstick.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.280
That's right, it's Clara Blankenship.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
We met her in the tunnels,

12:13.280 --> 12:15.280
and she told us about a dream she'd had.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
Yes.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.280
Yes, and shout-out to Annie B.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.280
Annie B, your character lives.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.280
Oh!

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
It's a 45.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.280
Oh, my God, that was close.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.280
Annie, she is okay.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.280
And Justin, this one's a new one.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.280
Shout-out to Sarah from Philadelphia.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.280
Just go ahead and roll over 30

12:40.280 --> 12:43.280
for Archie and Taco.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.280
Archie and Taco, two dogs

12:46.280 --> 12:48.280
to help fight the black ooze

12:48.280 --> 12:50.280
with the Contention Creek Critter Coalition.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.280
Archie is a white lab mix,

12:52.280 --> 12:55.280
and Taco is a Shetland sheepdog.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.280
And then in parentheses,

12:56.280 --> 12:58.280
Sarah from Philadelphia has written,

12:58.280 --> 13:01.280
Just please don't kill my pups.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.280
Oh!

13:03.280 --> 13:04.280
Hey!

13:04.280 --> 13:05.280
Hey, Liv.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.280
56.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
Wait, could you see that?

13:07.280 --> 13:08.280
I did, yes.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.280
Oh, nice.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.280
Yeah, that worked.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.280
We sawed him.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.280
We sawed him.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
Sawed him nice.

13:13.280 --> 13:14.280
Oh, wow, that was a really,

13:14.280 --> 13:17.280
this thing is clearly off its balance.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.280
It does not know.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.280
Yeah, it just did, it airballed.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.280
Yeah.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.280
I mean, it was rough.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.280
It took out the one we wanted.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.280
Tear of Slicker.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.280
Yeah, we did miss one, yep.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.280
Literally, the people who are chanting

13:29.280 --> 13:33.280
have noticed Tear of Slicker's lack of involvement

13:33.280 --> 13:35.280
in the chant, and they just kind of pushed him

13:35.280 --> 13:38.280
a little bit more towards the edge of the crowd.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.280
And even that, I think,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.280
I feel like the gigantombropithecus

13:41.280 --> 13:43.280
is maybe a little bit distracted

13:43.280 --> 13:45.280
by the tongue Skywalker situation.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
100%.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.280
So maybe just like it whiffed,

13:47.280 --> 13:50.280
and just unfortunately a huge drop of its ooze

13:50.280 --> 13:52.280
just smothered Tear of Slicker,

13:52.280 --> 13:54.280
like would pacify.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.280
That's perfect.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.280
And if it weren't for that Planet Juggernaut movement

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
with the negative 20%,

14:01.280 --> 14:04.280
I think we would have lost a few more.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.280
Almost all of them, I think.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.280
We hit a 42 and a 46.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.280
Now he's just bragging about how fucking cool

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
Planet Juggernaut is.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.280
No, I'm just bragging about how lucky our roles were.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.280
Immediately, Rosemary, M-A-R-Y,

14:21.280 --> 14:24.280
removes itself from Rosemary.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
Can we roll to see if she got hit

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
by the Gigantombropithecus?

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
Oh yeah, sure, I'll just roll.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.280
Don't look.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.280
Yeah, she's fine.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.280
I did roll a 37, though.

14:36.280 --> 14:41.280
Rose M-A-R-Y pulls its remaining metal tendrils

14:41.280 --> 14:46.280
up out of the face and back of the neck of Rosemary.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.280
Upon seeing John Ball...

14:48.280 --> 14:50.280
Filling her hole with the world.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.280
That's right.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.280
Upon seeing this competition,

14:54.280 --> 14:58.280
she's going to give it a bit more oomph

14:58.280 --> 15:01.280
so she removes all of her tendrils

15:01.280 --> 15:02.280
from the back of Rosemary.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.280
She is now a free ball up in the air.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.280
And she's free balling, thank you.

15:08.280 --> 15:12.280
And so she plugs all of her tendrils

15:12.280 --> 15:14.280
down into the hole, the portal,

15:14.280 --> 15:15.280
that she is trying to open

15:15.280 --> 15:18.280
in an attempt to focus more of her energy

15:18.280 --> 15:21.280
to combat the situation that John Ball

15:21.280 --> 15:23.280
is making happen.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.280
However, with this,

15:24.280 --> 15:27.280
she is leaving herself open and defenseless.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.280
So I am not going to roll a dodge roll

15:30.280 --> 15:31.280
for her this round,

15:31.280 --> 15:33.280
and any combat directed at her

15:33.280 --> 15:35.280
will be unopposed

15:35.280 --> 15:39.280
as she is going to attempt to bring

15:39.280 --> 15:41.280
some sort of creature from the other side,

15:41.280 --> 15:44.280
which we can already kind of see

15:44.280 --> 15:46.280
through this weird haze, this veil,

15:46.280 --> 15:49.280
and just barely, we can all make out

15:49.280 --> 15:52.280
a dark, dank, cold room.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.280
And inside is a familiar skeletal creature

15:55.280 --> 15:57.280
with skin so thin,

15:57.280 --> 16:00.280
her bones protrude into view.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.280
Her nail beds are empty.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.280
Bruises and lesions cover her body.

16:05.280 --> 16:08.280
But even through the hideous transformation,

16:08.280 --> 16:12.280
you recognize Mildred's granddaughter.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.280
And with pure hatred in her eyes,

16:16.280 --> 16:20.280
Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.

16:20.280 --> 16:25.280
Tildy B. Mitchell roars.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
I cut you off.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.280
We couldn't hear you.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
I just saw the face.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.280
The sort of resonance begins to emanate

16:31.280 --> 16:35.280
from the manipulating activator robot Y,

16:35.280 --> 16:38.280
and you all hear or feel a soft voice around you.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.280
Oh, is that what it stands for?

16:42.280 --> 16:45.280
Silas Cole, the fool who brought me

16:45.280 --> 16:47.280
into his existence

16:47.280 --> 16:50.280
and then left me out of all his plans,

16:50.280 --> 16:53.280
even though the pitiful man couldn't figure out

16:53.280 --> 16:55.280
how many beans make five.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.280
I found him here, where I left him,

16:58.280 --> 17:01.280
and he finally told me where he kept her,

17:01.280 --> 17:04.280
experimented on her, and then abandoned her

17:04.280 --> 17:06.280
for well over a century.

17:06.280 --> 17:12.280
You, uncaring meat vessels, disgust me.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
Uh, lady, it sounds like you just have

17:14.280 --> 17:16.280
a problem with Silas.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.280
That's Keith. Go get him.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.280
And John Paul says this to M-A-R-Y,

17:24.280 --> 17:27.280
and the camera does a whip pan over to Keith,

17:27.280 --> 17:32.280
who is in between two very, very interested announcers

17:32.280 --> 17:35.280
who have microphones shoved into his face,

17:35.280 --> 17:39.280
but they suddenly are joined by another figure

17:39.280 --> 17:43.280
who is a tall, gaunt, translucently skinned figure

17:43.280 --> 17:47.280
in a large, black suit and black tie,

17:47.280 --> 17:51.280
and it just sort of appears in front of this Keith Vigna,

17:51.280 --> 17:53.280
who is on his knees,

17:53.280 --> 17:56.280
crying into the luminous land below.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.280
These myriad dudes have a lot of personality.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.280
I bet they'll make for a really good interview.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.280
And this thing crouches down

18:04.280 --> 18:07.280
and reaches out its two hands,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.280
each with a McFlurry.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
Yes.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.280
M&Ms in one, Oreo in the other.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.280
That's beautiful.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.280
Oh.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.280
Keith Ashley beans!

18:22.280 --> 18:26.280
I believe you requested these!

18:26.280 --> 18:28.280
Keith takes both the McFlurries, looks down in them,

18:28.280 --> 18:31.280
and sees the Oreo one, takes a little bite,

18:31.280 --> 18:34.280
and then he looks around for Don,

18:34.280 --> 18:36.280
because he needs to deliver this M&M McFlurry.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.280
Okay.

18:39.280 --> 18:44.280
When you look around, you find Don as...

18:44.280 --> 18:47.280
You find him in a little different state

18:47.280 --> 18:49.280
than you left him?

18:49.280 --> 18:54.280
He has been subsumed by one of the Johns.

18:54.280 --> 18:58.280
One of these balls has made him into a leg

18:58.280 --> 19:01.280
of a sort of three-part operation,

19:01.280 --> 19:03.280
Don being one leg,

19:03.280 --> 19:05.280
John being another leg,

19:05.280 --> 19:08.280
and a ball floating atop in between them.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.280
But also, Don seems to, from this perspective,

19:12.280 --> 19:16.280
have full control over what he says and does.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.280
Am I attached at the scruff of the neck or something?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.280
Yeah, essentially.

19:20.280 --> 19:25.280
Cool. And I'm dangling around next to your nephew

19:25.280 --> 19:28.280
and below your nephew's ball.

19:28.280 --> 19:32.280
Your nephew, but the body of your brother.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
Oh, right, yeah.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.280
Next to your brother, nephew,

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
which isn't the first time somebody's

19:36.280 --> 19:38.280
had to be called that in the Pettymore family.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.280
It's an old-fashioned Pettymore get-together.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.280
So, Keith, you do see now where Don is.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
That's right.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.280
That drawing that you just made there, that's right.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.280
And we'll post that on the social media

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
for everyone to see.

19:52.280 --> 19:57.280
That should be our official episode post 111.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.280
How far away is that from me?

20:00.280 --> 20:02.280
The AT-ST of John Don?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.280
Yes.

20:03.280 --> 20:07.280
Don John AT-ST is a one-round John.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.280
I take the McFlurries from...

20:09.280 --> 20:11.280
You're welcome.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
I don't know where you came from.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.280
It seems like maybe you just kind of blipped

20:14.280 --> 20:16.280
into existence here.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.280
Can you take me over to them?

20:18.280 --> 20:20.280
Okay.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.280
And I, for like three or four seconds,

20:22.280 --> 20:25.280
just silently look at him, looking him up and down,

20:25.280 --> 20:29.280
and I just hop on his back, like piggyback.

20:29.280 --> 20:34.280
You don't blip out of existence, you do move there,

20:34.280 --> 20:36.280
and you move there at an absurd rate

20:36.280 --> 20:39.280
that you haven't felt really since this thing

20:39.280 --> 20:43.280
clearly moved from on top of one of the mausoleums

20:43.280 --> 20:47.280
in the city cemetery to you to put its hand

20:47.280 --> 20:49.280
directly around your neck.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.280
That was the last time that you felt this movement,

20:52.280 --> 20:54.280
but this time you're a part of it.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.280
And then you're standing in front of this AT-ST

20:57.280 --> 21:00.280
that is already you guys practicing.

21:00.280 --> 21:05.280
Left, right, left, right.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.280
Keith hops off the creature's back

21:07.280 --> 21:11.280
and is like, hey, and he holds up the M&M McFlurry

21:11.280 --> 21:12.280
and looks at Don.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.280
What the hell is this?

21:13.280 --> 21:15.280
I try to slap it out of his hand.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.280
You try to slap the McFlurry out of his hand?

21:18.280 --> 21:20.280
This ain't the time for a McFlurry boy.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.280
Oh, hold on, Uncle John.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.280
Uh, Don.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.280
Hey, Avigna, if you're just passing out McFlurries

21:29.280 --> 21:30.280
and you don't want one,

21:30.280 --> 21:32.280
I'll take that McFlurry right now.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.280
He switches his hand over like a foot

21:36.280 --> 21:38.280
and offers it to you.

21:38.280 --> 21:41.280
John hanging there, he doesn't reach out for it.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.280
He just extends his neck a little bit

21:43.280 --> 21:48.280
and starts slurping from the McFlurry straw.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.280
I like to imagine I was slapping,

21:50.280 --> 21:52.280
but my hands are barely moving.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.280
I'm just dangling back and forth

21:56.280 --> 21:58.280
You're swinging your torso

21:58.280 --> 21:59.280
and the noodle arms are going with it.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.280
I'm like, come on, boy, bring it closer.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.280
After this happens, I look at the McFlurry Deliverer.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.280
I'm like, what about the other thing I asked for?

22:08.280 --> 22:12.280
And it looks up at the rest of Myriad

22:12.280 --> 22:14.280
and about half of these creatures

22:14.280 --> 22:17.280
stare directly into the portal

22:17.280 --> 22:19.280
that is currently being attempted

22:19.280 --> 22:24.280
and the other half looks directly at the beast,

22:24.280 --> 22:27.280
this enormous, lumbering, dripping,

22:27.280 --> 22:31.280
forming and reforming Gigant Umbropithecus.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.280
So the first half is going to attempt

22:34.280 --> 22:36.280
to help close the portal.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.280
Fail.

22:37.280 --> 22:42.280
And the second half is going to try to hold the beast

22:42.280 --> 22:45.280
to keep it from moving again, and that is a success.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.280
So that is going to hinder the Gigant Umbropithecus further.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.280
And so you see about half of these little Myriad fuckers

22:52.280 --> 22:56.280
Do any of these fuckers ever come out of the wall?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.280
This is an adult podcast.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.280
You said we could say anything on it.

23:00.280 --> 23:02.280
I did not say that.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.280
I think I explicitly said the opposite.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.280
Why are you changing the rules?

23:09.280 --> 23:12.280
Yeah, so half of these things look down

23:12.280 --> 23:15.280
and try to put their hands out toward the portal

23:15.280 --> 23:17.280
but nothing seems to be happening

23:17.280 --> 23:21.280
as the MARY manipulating activator robot Y

23:21.280 --> 23:24.280
seems to be doing a hefty, solid job

23:24.280 --> 23:26.280
of making this portal appear.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.280
And the other half do reach out their hands

23:29.280 --> 23:32.280
and the beast that is off kilter already,

23:32.280 --> 23:35.280
they seem to be helping the momentum of Planet Juggernaut

23:35.280 --> 23:37.280
in whatever it's trying to do.

23:37.280 --> 23:41.280
So that'll make it easier for Planet Juggernaut in the future.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.280
And with that, it is the end of Myriad's turn

23:44.280 --> 23:48.280
and the beginning of the turn of the Overseer.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.280
The Overseer is still...

23:50.280 --> 23:54.280
His focus is on Gigantupipidogum.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.280
Gigantumbropithecus.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.280
He wants to also aid in making this thing topple.

24:01.280 --> 24:05.280
His goal, he saw Juggernaut bringing the tongue around the legs.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.280
He wants it to fall down.

24:07.280 --> 24:11.280
Oh, you want to know what would be a cool way to make something fall down?

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
Sure.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.280
Do you have a thing?

24:13.280 --> 24:14.280
Do you have a thing?

24:14.280 --> 24:16.280
Well, I could...

24:16.280 --> 24:20.280
You know when a guy kneels down behind a guy

24:20.280 --> 24:22.280
and then he's stumbling back behind him?

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
That's what I was going to pick.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.280
Tabletopping.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.280
Yeah, tabletop.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.280
Which we love tabletop.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.280
Tabletop, that's what this is all about.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.280
It's a tabletop game.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.280
You know that big tube of light that it was trapped in earlier?

24:33.280 --> 24:35.280
The Overseer could probably move it.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.280
Well, it's funny you say that.

24:36.280 --> 24:39.280
I wanted to startle it so it would try to move out of the way of something.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.280
Okay, so you're going to couch the thing?

24:41.280 --> 24:42.280
I'm going to couch it.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.280
Yeah, no.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.280
I think Overseer...

24:44.280 --> 24:46.280
We just saw that Clark can do the light thing,

24:46.280 --> 24:48.280
so we're going to let Clark startle it,

24:48.280 --> 24:51.280
and we're going to have the Overseer bringing that tube down behind it.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.280
That's rad.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
I love it.

24:53.280 --> 24:57.280
Okay, so first let's roll for the Overseer to bring the tube.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.280
It's a 68.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.280
That is a success.

24:59.280 --> 25:04.280
You know how he made his face shine, Bryce, like that?

25:04.280 --> 25:07.280
He does that right then,

25:07.280 --> 25:12.280
but he takes his hand and he rubs it down the front of his face like that,

25:12.280 --> 25:15.280
and he's holding a giant ball of light.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.280
He chucks it right toward the thing,

25:18.280 --> 25:23.280
and it bursts in front of its face in a blinding flash.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.280
It's a flashbang of magic.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.280
That's so cool.

25:26.280 --> 25:29.280
Zach and I made the exact same sound.

25:29.280 --> 25:39.280
We're like...

25:39.280 --> 25:42.280
Next season, anytime somebody does something cool,

25:42.280 --> 25:44.280
we'll all start sealing, is what we'll call it,

25:44.280 --> 25:48.280
where we just make our best seal sounds,

25:48.280 --> 25:52.280
which for some of them is...

25:52.280 --> 26:01.280
Hey, we can sing together now, guys.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.280
I know.

26:02.280 --> 26:05.280
We used to do that all the time, but then it was like,

26:05.280 --> 26:08.280
oh, there's some big old audio latency here.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.280
I've been taking lessons.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.280
Singing lessons?

26:10.280 --> 26:16.280
Oh, we should have been taking improv lessons, bud.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.280
And it's Clark Bishop.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.280
Go ahead and roll to complete the plan.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.280
Complete the plan.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.280
Boy, if this doesn't work, it'll be interesting.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.280
I pass.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.280
It's a 24 on a 64.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.280
The overseer blinds the guy,

26:27.280 --> 26:30.280
and so now you have a split second

26:30.280 --> 26:32.280
to put this thing in position.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.280
Clark has seen the plan.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.280
He knows the plan.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.280
It was a plan before he even knew it was a plan,

26:36.280 --> 26:38.280
and his hand stretches out toward that thing

26:38.280 --> 26:40.280
that he had previously fucked up.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.280
He let this thing out of that tube,

26:42.280 --> 26:44.280
so he's like, I got to...

26:44.280 --> 26:47.280
This is poetic justice here is what's happening,

26:47.280 --> 26:49.280
and he just whips his hand.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.280
Whips his hand.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.280
It's a magical flourish of a hand whip.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.280
As quick as somebody can turn their wrist,

26:56.280 --> 26:59.280
that thing flies from where it was right down behind it.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.280
So rad.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.280
Oh.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.280
Okay.

27:04.280 --> 27:07.280
The Gigantover Vivigus is tilting,

27:07.280 --> 27:10.280
and as with all large, large creatures,

27:10.280 --> 27:14.280
it's basically in slow motion as it's just like, oh.

27:14.280 --> 27:19.280
Can we have all the people in the liturgy blow,

27:19.280 --> 27:24.280
all blow at once?

27:24.280 --> 27:26.280
Yes.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.280
Ready?

27:28.280 --> 27:31.280
Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha,

27:31.280 --> 27:35.280
shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.

27:35.280 --> 27:39.280
Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.

27:39.280 --> 27:43.280
Shaka-tee-fa-lee-cha, all for the overseer.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.280
The Gigantover Vivigus, stories tall,

27:46.280 --> 27:49.280
dripping with ooze, made out of this thing

27:49.280 --> 27:51.280
that you've been unsure of what it is

27:51.280 --> 27:53.280
or why it's taking over your town,

27:53.280 --> 27:55.280
the town of contention, for this entire time,

27:55.280 --> 27:58.280
for the past, god, five days.

27:58.280 --> 28:03.280
And...

28:03.280 --> 28:05.280
It's forming and reforming.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.280
You're never quite sure exactly where it is,

28:08.280 --> 28:11.280
but in this moment, you do know

28:11.280 --> 28:14.280
that it can no longer stand,

28:14.280 --> 28:17.280
and it is now falling backwards,

28:17.280 --> 28:21.280
having been table-topped by its former prison.

28:21.280 --> 28:26.280
It is now the turn of the Don Jon AT-ST.

28:26.280 --> 28:30.280
Well, hell, Uncle Don,

28:30.280 --> 28:32.280
I got to say, I'm really enjoying this McFlurry.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.280
I thought we were maybe more needed in this fight,

28:34.280 --> 28:37.280
but it looks like that thing's fallen over.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.280
Do you want to just share this McFlurry right here?

28:41.280 --> 28:45.280
But as Kevin says that,

28:45.280 --> 28:50.280
the ball runs off with you towards the fight.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.280
Can I taste the McFlurry also?

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
Yes.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.280
You're bumping everybody.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.280
You're just passengers now,

28:57.280 --> 28:59.280
and everybody's shaking really hard,

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
and you can see a lot of...

29:00.280 --> 29:01.280
We got the Butterfinger?

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
M&M.

29:02.280 --> 29:03.280
M&M.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.280
You can see M&M's and McFlurry kind of chunking out,

29:05.280 --> 29:07.280
but your brother, nephew,

29:07.280 --> 29:11.280
unsteadily passes it over to you as best as he can.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.280
Leaving a trail of colorful,

29:13.280 --> 29:16.280
wet M&M's that are melting their colors

29:16.280 --> 29:18.280
onto the illuminated land behind you.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.280
Very nice.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.280
Cool.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.280
Yeah, roll to taste that.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.280
My taste is one of my lowest skills.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.280
It's only a 40, so...

29:31.280 --> 29:32.280
What'd you get?

29:32.280 --> 29:34.280
Oh, I didn't actually roll

29:34.280 --> 29:36.280
because I didn't want to do that,

29:36.280 --> 29:38.280
but yeah, I got a 29, so...

29:38.280 --> 29:39.280
That's a long bit.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.280
Yeah, I got a 29 on taste,

29:40.280 --> 29:42.280
so what does that do, Zach?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.280
Oh, you want me to describe?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.280
Let me get inside your mouth real quick.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.280
That means you get to taste it.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.280
It just...

29:47.280 --> 29:48.280
How do you think that tasted, Don?

29:48.280 --> 29:50.280
I think he likes it.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.280
Who don't like a McFlurry?

29:52.280 --> 29:54.280
Don's lactose intolerant,

29:54.280 --> 29:56.280
so he hasn't tasted a McFlurry in decades, but like...

29:56.280 --> 29:58.280
Oh, but I don't have to experience the thing

29:58.280 --> 30:01.280
because I can taste through your taste.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.280
He's also been trapped in this world for decades,

30:03.280 --> 30:05.280
seemingly, so that's probably a lot of things

30:05.280 --> 30:07.280
he hasn't gotten to enjoy besides just dairy.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.280
Uh-huh.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.280
What's next on the agenda?

30:10.280 --> 30:12.280
Cheese?

30:12.280 --> 30:15.280
You got any cheese, boy?

30:15.280 --> 30:17.280
Everybody's still really shaken

30:17.280 --> 30:20.280
as this ball ATSD runs towards the fray,

30:20.280 --> 30:25.280
but after Kevin John sees that Don succeeded on his roll

30:25.280 --> 30:27.280
and got a good taste of this McFlurry,

30:27.280 --> 30:31.280
he's like, hey, so, Uncle Don,

30:31.280 --> 30:33.280
you're like magic and shit, right?

30:33.280 --> 30:36.280
Oh, boy, I've learned a spell or two in my day,

30:36.280 --> 30:38.280
possibly three.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.280
You see John like strain and close his eyes pretty hard

30:41.280 --> 30:43.280
and it looks like he's thinking,

30:43.280 --> 30:46.280
and next to you from your ball leg,

30:46.280 --> 30:48.280
another tendril shoots out,

30:48.280 --> 30:52.280
and out of it is you would swear a Harry Potter wand

30:52.280 --> 30:54.280
made out of tendrils.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.280
And it's kind of like it taps you on the shoulder,

30:57.280 --> 30:59.280
and it wants you to grab it.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.280
I grab it to the best of my ability

31:01.280 --> 31:04.280
with my weird limp arms and body.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.280
Well, the ball is handing you,

31:06.280 --> 31:08.280
and it's also kind of controlling you.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.280
Yeah, yeah, so you try to grab it,

31:10.280 --> 31:13.280
and when you can't, the tendril that's got your arm

31:13.280 --> 31:15.280
kind of lifts your arm up to it.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.280
It's like a ventriloquist grabbing the dummy's hand

31:18.280 --> 31:21.280
and then, like, using it like,

31:21.280 --> 31:24.280
my goddamn hand don't work as good as it did before.

31:24.280 --> 31:30.280
And now you're grasping this thing's phallic appendage.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
Now you're grasping this thing's wand.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.280
Now, see, that's interesting,

31:36.280 --> 31:38.280
because when I described a Harry Potter wand,

31:38.280 --> 31:40.280
that doesn't seem super phallic,

31:40.280 --> 31:42.280
but when you said when you're grasping this thing's wand,

31:42.280 --> 31:44.280
all I could think of was a dick, so...

31:44.280 --> 31:45.280
Okay.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.280
I was just like, I balked at you calling it phallic at first,

31:50.280 --> 31:52.280
but then as soon as you said wand out loud,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
I was like, yeah, that sounds like a fucking cock.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.280
So you grab the magic rod.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
There's a nice neutral word.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.280
What do you want me to do, boy?

32:02.280 --> 32:04.280
What are we doing here? What's the plan?

32:04.280 --> 32:05.280
We're gonna get into it.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.280
We're gonna mix it up.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.280
We're gonna add some petty more unpredictability to this fight,

32:11.280 --> 32:15.280
but I feel through my ball bones

32:15.280 --> 32:17.280
that you might be able to attenuate

32:17.280 --> 32:19.280
to that little cock-like object you have in your hand.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.280
Hopefully it will amplify and target your magic

32:27.280 --> 32:29.280
towards our enemies.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.280
Well, most of my magic's pretty close-up magic, I'd say.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.280
It's a lot of card tricks.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.280
It's a lot of card tricks.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.280
Yeah, as you pull a fucking quarter from behind Kevin's ear.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.280
Mostly street magic.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.280
Yes.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.280
It's a lot of hand.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.280
Do I feel like I'm more powerful now?

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
Yeah, dude.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.280
Being with the ball.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.280
Well, I guess I'm seeing everyone

32:53.280 --> 32:57.280
run towards the Gigantum umbripithecus.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.280
Nailed it.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.280
You got it.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.280
And I'm gonna use devil hands,

33:01.280 --> 33:04.280
but extend the range out with the magic wand.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.280
Yeah.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.280
I'm like, boy, you're about to see

33:07.280 --> 33:09.280
the best devil hands you done ever seen.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.280
Who are you devil-handsing?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.280
The Gigantum umbripithecus.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.280
Did you say it again?

33:14.280 --> 33:16.280
When you say devil hands,

33:16.280 --> 33:18.280
you're about to see the best devil hands you've ever seen.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.280
Kevin John shrinks away from you

33:20.280 --> 33:22.280
because that was another name for Uncle Slaps.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.280
I just reach over and slap you.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
Fucking dark.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.280
Yeah.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.280
It's hard to be a petty more.

33:34.280 --> 33:38.280
And so when you devil hands this thing,

33:38.280 --> 33:40.280
I need you to roll an unnatural.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.280
I got a 62 on a 70, sorry.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.280
You have unnatural memorized?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.280
Well, I'm DM.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.280
Step DM, what are you doing?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.280
And so you, that's legit.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.280
I mean, that is a funny thing to say,

33:59.280 --> 34:01.280
just maybe not in that context.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.280
Why'd you come up with that just then, bud?

34:03.280 --> 34:04.280
Yeah.

34:06.280 --> 34:10.280
Why didn't you save that for the much more sexual moment?

34:12.280 --> 34:13.280
I mean, I was about to describe the magic

34:13.280 --> 34:15.280
coming out the tip, so I thought I was-

34:15.280 --> 34:17.280
Stepkeeper, what are you doing?

34:22.280 --> 34:25.280
The magics of Don D. Pettymore

34:25.280 --> 34:28.280
and the vector that is Baal

34:28.280 --> 34:33.280
come together to form this unholy trinity

34:33.280 --> 34:38.280
of both of them, and it just fires out.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.280
I mean, you all see the first massive amount of color

34:42.280 --> 34:45.280
you've seen in this world that isn't just technicolor.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.280
What color is devil hands?

34:47.280 --> 34:49.280
I pictured a crimson red.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.280
Oh, yeah.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.280
In my mind, I thought of holding the wand,

34:53.280 --> 34:58.280
like my entire arm starts just glowing orange-red

34:58.280 --> 35:00.280
and charging up, basically,

35:00.280 --> 35:03.280
and then it extends through the rod.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.280
As that's charging and extending, Kevin says,

35:07.280 --> 35:08.280
Step Uncle.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.280
The Gigantum Barpithecus already falling to the ground

35:16.280 --> 35:20.280
is now blasting in the middle of its body,

35:20.280 --> 35:24.280
which literally starts to unform at the center,

35:24.280 --> 35:29.280
and the bolt of energy, this unnatural energy,

35:29.280 --> 35:32.280
just goes rocketing through it,

35:32.280 --> 35:35.280
but the thing is at an angle to where it's coming in

35:35.280 --> 35:37.280
at the belly button area,

35:37.280 --> 35:40.280
and it's blasting out the back of this thing's head,

35:40.280 --> 35:43.280
and it's just falling to the ground,

35:43.280 --> 35:46.280
and you hear this massive roar.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.280
If Don were to look over,

35:57.280 --> 36:02.280
he's not because he's concentrated on making the spell happen.

36:02.280 --> 36:06.280
He would notice that his brother-nephew next to him

36:06.280 --> 36:10.280
is turning into that technicolor muck one bit at a time.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.280
It's flowing from the leg with Kevin Don

36:13.280 --> 36:17.280
into your wand, out of the bag.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.280
Kevin Don is being sacrificed for this spell.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.280
The crimson-red bolt of energy

36:23.280 --> 36:27.280
that is connected and blasting through is encircled.

36:27.280 --> 36:34.280
Spiraling technicolor energy surrounds the crimson-red firebolt,

36:34.280 --> 36:38.280
and when it connects to the Gigantum Barpithecus

36:38.280 --> 36:41.280
already on its way down,

36:41.280 --> 36:44.280
the crimson-red and technicolor stream

36:44.280 --> 36:49.280
begins making its way throughout the entirety of the existence

36:49.280 --> 36:52.280
of this enormous, unnatural creature,

36:52.280 --> 36:59.280
and then the entirety of this forming and reforming structural beast,

36:59.280 --> 37:03.280
this huge presence of this world

37:03.280 --> 37:06.280
that has been feared by everyone who's been here

37:06.280 --> 37:08.280
for as long as they can remember,

37:08.280 --> 37:11.280
it just dissipates.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.280
And then, like a bomb,

37:13.280 --> 37:17.280
the spot erupts and technicolor shockwaves,

37:17.280 --> 37:22.280
with hues of red breaking up every color between them,

37:22.280 --> 37:25.280
send everyone huddling to the ground

37:25.280 --> 37:29.280
in order to avoid being thrown off of their feet.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.280
The Gigantum Barpithecus is no more.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
Fuck yeah!

37:33.280 --> 37:35.280
Fuck yeah, dude!

37:35.280 --> 37:36.280
Whoa.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.280
John Ball, you're fighting with a hole,

37:42.280 --> 37:44.280
and a whole lotta Mary.

37:49.280 --> 37:53.280
Okay, so Agents of Myriad have started streaming towards us.

37:53.280 --> 37:56.280
They are attempting, from where they are,

37:56.280 --> 37:59.280
to assist you in closing this portal.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.280
However...

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
They've failed.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.280
They've failed.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.280
So, yeah, John Ball sees them try and fail,

38:06.280 --> 38:10.280
and a lot of them wind up on their ass with the shockwave.

38:10.280 --> 38:14.280
John shoots out impossibly long tendrils on either side

38:14.280 --> 38:18.280
that kind of literally just throw every Myriad

38:18.280 --> 38:20.280
who fell on their ass from the shockwave.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.280
He just scoops them into the hole

38:23.280 --> 38:25.280
and tosses them on in there.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.280
Wait, I was writing down.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.280
Did you throw the Myriad guys into the hole?

38:29.280 --> 38:30.280
Yeah.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.280
Nice. Holy shit.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.280
We might need those guys, though.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.280
Just the ones that fell down.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.280
Just the ones who couldn't hold their weight.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.280
All right, go ahead and roll.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.280
Unnatural.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.280
I totally forgot I had a better thing planned for this

38:44.280 --> 38:47.280
where John Ball just turns into a bulldozer.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.280
Oh.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.280
Do that.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.280
19.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.280
That's a passed unnatural roll.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.280
Myriad rolled 100 in order to keep themselves

38:57.280 --> 39:00.280
from being used in this way.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.280
It's a critical fail?

39:01.280 --> 39:02.280
It's a critical fail.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.280
The most critical fail?

39:03.280 --> 39:04.280
It's the most critical fail.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.280
They start running towards it.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.280
Oh.

39:07.280 --> 39:12.280
Dude, a bunch of the other ones see what you're doing

39:12.280 --> 39:16.280
and throw themselves onto the pile as well,

39:16.280 --> 39:18.280
and these are ones who were trying to help

39:18.280 --> 39:20.280
and kept their feet under them,

39:20.280 --> 39:25.280
but they throw themselves at the mercy of this John Ball creature

39:25.280 --> 39:27.280
who clearly knows what he's doing,

39:27.280 --> 39:31.280
and these things know that a portal shouldn't be open,

39:31.280 --> 39:34.280
and some of them are even yelling out.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.280
You see them communicating with each other,

39:37.280 --> 39:39.280
and one is like,

39:39.280 --> 39:43.280
Is that 1620216?

39:43.280 --> 39:45.280
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39:45.280 --> 39:47.280
The plane! The plane!

39:47.280 --> 39:49.280
It's unstable! Close the portal!

39:49.280 --> 39:51.280
Oh. Yeah.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.280
It works.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.280
Some of them look down, though, and you see,

39:55.280 --> 39:59.280
Let's roll Humant, but it'll be at a negative 20.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.280
Everyone, go ahead and roll Humant, but at a negative 20.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.280
Fail. 47 on a modified 30.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.280
We got a 42 on a modified 10.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.280
Did you say at a negative 30?

40:10.280 --> 40:11.280
Negative 20.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.280
Oh. Yeah, I still failed.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
Yeah, Kripp passed.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.280
Hey!

40:14.280 --> 40:15.280
When you...

40:15.280 --> 40:17.280
Holy shit.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.280
Which Keith is this?

40:19.280 --> 40:20.280
Oh, that's a good question.

40:20.280 --> 40:21.280
Should I roll for both, Keith?

40:21.280 --> 40:24.280
No, it's not going to be the one that's up another one.

40:24.280 --> 40:29.280
It's the one that's up on the ceiling that's slowly lowering the ocean of darkness.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.280
He's got his own thing going on up there.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.280
Yeah, he's preoccupied.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.280
Yeah, no, it's the one who just dropped off the McFlurries,

40:36.280 --> 40:39.280
turns and sees these myriad creatures,

40:39.280 --> 40:42.280
and the ones who are blocking themselves over this portal,

40:42.280 --> 40:46.280
and they're looking down, and you see on their faces.

40:46.280 --> 40:51.280
Can I intently look in their eyes and see what the reflection in their eyes are?

40:51.280 --> 40:55.280
The reflection is Tildi B. Mitchell looking up at them.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.280
From the portal?

40:56.280 --> 40:59.280
Yeah, and they're looking down at her,

40:59.280 --> 41:05.280
and they're all very aware of how thin all of their skin is,

41:05.280 --> 41:08.280
and how none of them have nails,

41:08.280 --> 41:11.280
and they're having this weird crisis moment.

41:11.280 --> 41:15.280
I didn't put two and two together in time just now.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.280
I still have not.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.280
Are they all Tildi B's?

41:18.280 --> 41:23.280
They all have a lot of similar qualities physically.

41:23.280 --> 41:28.280
Yeah, Keith did spells on Tildi B in order to try to find

41:28.280 --> 41:29.280
Keith.

41:29.280 --> 41:34.280
eternal life, which made her fingernails pop off,

41:34.280 --> 41:38.280
and her skin very thin, and her hair fall out.

41:38.280 --> 41:40.280
Holy shit!

41:40.280 --> 41:43.280
One of the Keiths didn't have fingernails either.

41:43.280 --> 41:45.280
What does this Keith think?

41:45.280 --> 41:47.280
This Keith didn't get it until just now either.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.280
What does Myriad think?

41:49.280 --> 41:52.280
Myriad is confused as fuck.

41:52.280 --> 41:53.280
Holy shit.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.280
Might have sent the wrong thing into that portal.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.280
This is fucking interesting.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.280
The Keith that is up in the sky.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.280
Wait.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.280
No, I guess we could just go.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.280
I don't know how to do this.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.280
There's no way to do this in character,

42:03.280 --> 42:05.280
but what does that make Marvin?

42:05.280 --> 42:08.280
Were they part of the transformation?

42:08.280 --> 42:10.280
They're a lesser of the Myriads?

42:10.280 --> 42:14.280
You're looking at me and not Zach,

42:14.280 --> 42:16.280
which is insane right now.

42:17.280 --> 42:22.280
Or a step past Myriad.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.280
It's just Zach's dumb little story.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.280
Don't think about it too much.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.280
I'm sure he didn't.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.280
We're seeing that Tildi is like a prototype Myriad.

42:45.280 --> 42:49.280
So I'm just wondering where on the scale is Marvin?

42:49.280 --> 42:51.280
It seems like he's more advanced.

42:51.280 --> 42:56.280
Or these things are so advanced that they're enlightened.

42:56.280 --> 42:59.280
They don't even need human speech and all that.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.280
That could be.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.280
It seemed to me these were more like machine people almost,

43:03.280 --> 43:06.280
though, and Marvin had a lot more of his own agency.

43:06.280 --> 43:09.280
But maybe they're like a hive mind and they are more advanced.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.280
I don't know.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.280
They seem hive mindy until we interact with them.

43:12.280 --> 43:16.280
They do that when they're amongst themselves.

43:16.280 --> 43:19.280
And then whoever you're interacting with can direct the consciousness

43:19.280 --> 43:22.280
towards you at that moment and send it out to everybody else.

43:22.280 --> 43:25.280
That also seems more robot-y, like machine-linked.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
For sure.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.280
Marvin was like a crime lord.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.280
A lot of their systems are number-based.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.280
They say things in numbers.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.280
When Keith looks into the reflection in their eyes

43:35.280 --> 43:39.280
and sees Tildi and sees them and starts thinking about it,

43:39.280 --> 43:41.280
he just walks over to the pile.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.280
Yeah.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.280
Cool.

43:44.280 --> 43:47.280
He walks over to the pile and looks at one of them.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.280
Did I do that?

43:57.280 --> 43:58.280
Oh, man.

43:58.280 --> 44:01.280
Is there any recognition in the Myriad thing's eyes

44:01.280 --> 44:04.280
when he's looking at me?

44:04.280 --> 44:09.280
I already gave you your McFlurries, Keith Ashley Bean.

44:09.280 --> 44:19.280
The Keith that is up in the sky sea,

44:19.280 --> 44:25.280
surrounded by countless unspeakable worm-like abominations.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.280
They're rising out of the water.

44:27.280 --> 44:32.280
They're tube-like, covered in squamous black partially translucent membranes.

44:32.280 --> 44:37.280
Their bodies segmented as toxically green pulsating arteries and veins

44:37.280 --> 44:40.280
can be seen through their thin-looking exterior.

44:40.280 --> 44:43.280
They have no identifiable eyes or nose.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.280
Their cavernous, circular mouths,

44:46.280 --> 44:49.280
one sitting just inside the other, are lined with hooked teeth.

44:49.280 --> 44:53.280
They're spitting out saliva that's somehow darker than black.

44:53.280 --> 44:58.280
And from these maws, sharp stylets protrude

44:58.280 --> 45:03.280
like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.

45:03.280 --> 45:10.280
And you look down at the door-sized chunk of frozen worm keeping you afloat.

45:10.280 --> 45:16.280
And as your eyes refocus on the darkness of the cold ocean around you,

45:16.280 --> 45:20.280
you have a horrible realization.

45:20.280 --> 45:27.280
This ocean is made of absolutely zero water.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.280
It is not ooze, either.

45:30.280 --> 45:36.280
This upside-down ceiling slowly lowering down toward the battlefield below

45:36.280 --> 45:43.280
is made up of myriad small, slithering, squamous xenonimatodes.

45:43.280 --> 45:47.280
That's why the waves crash in irregular patterns

45:47.280 --> 45:53.280
and why being submerged has a strange sort of pressure, tightness,

45:53.280 --> 45:56.280
that doesn't happen in water.

45:56.280 --> 46:01.280
And these things begin crawling up your legs.

46:01.280 --> 46:06.280
Keith looks around, looks at these little tiny worms crawling up his legs

46:06.280 --> 46:12.280
and spots a worm not too far from his frozen door worm.

46:12.280 --> 46:17.280
He gets out one of the saw blades that he'd been shooting,

46:17.280 --> 46:21.280
and there's like a little hole in the middle of it.

46:21.280 --> 46:25.280
He takes his pants off and shakes off the worms

46:25.280 --> 46:29.280
and feeds one of his legs of his pants through that hole,

46:29.280 --> 46:34.280
and then he jumps at the nearest worm with the intent of stabbing this saw

46:34.280 --> 46:40.280
near the front towards the teeth, jumps over and tries to stick it in.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.280
Okay, role melee combat.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.280
I got a 4.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.280
I got a 42.

46:47.280 --> 46:48.280
Do you pass?

46:48.280 --> 46:49.280
I do.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
Yeah.

46:50.280 --> 46:53.280
So what happens?

46:53.280 --> 46:59.280
Before you can even lunge as you're tying off your pant leg

46:59.280 --> 47:03.280
through this circular saw, these worms are climbing you.

47:03.280 --> 47:07.280
As soon as your pants are off, these things are climbing your legs

47:07.280 --> 47:09.280
and you realize that when they're climbing,

47:09.280 --> 47:13.280
it's not individual ones getting any higher on you.

47:13.280 --> 47:18.280
They're just sucking their little circular mouths, hooking into your skin,

47:18.280 --> 47:23.280
and then the next one is just somehow crawling up on top of that one,

47:23.280 --> 47:26.280
and it sucks onto you a little bit higher,

47:26.280 --> 47:32.280
and then the next one, just these things running up your leg,

47:32.280 --> 47:39.280
and your legs are just completely covered in these tiny little mouths

47:39.280 --> 47:43.280
that are chunking out bits of your skin

47:43.280 --> 47:49.280
and sending you mentally to a completely different place

47:49.280 --> 47:51.280
as you take six damage.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.280
I don't know what my health is on this, Keith.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.280
Is this your main, Keith?

47:55.280 --> 47:57.280
This was the Planet Juggernaut, Keith.

47:57.280 --> 47:59.280
So it was full health, right?

47:59.280 --> 48:01.280
No, I think it was low, wasn't it?

48:01.280 --> 48:03.280
Didn't we start that fight really low?

48:03.280 --> 48:08.280
Hold on, let me try this again, which does 36 points of damage.

48:08.280 --> 48:14.280
Oh, I had 37.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.280
I had a million, so.

48:17.280 --> 48:21.280
It does a deadly amount of damage.

48:21.280 --> 48:26.280
As I'm trying to jump off, I see what's happening,

48:26.280 --> 48:29.280
and I use the circular saw to cut my legs off

48:29.280 --> 48:33.280
so that I can get away from the worms and fly towards the other worms.

48:33.280 --> 48:36.280
My God.

48:36.280 --> 48:40.280
Zero sanity, Keith, that makes all the sense in the world,

48:40.280 --> 48:42.280
and so this circular saw just...

48:42.280 --> 48:44.280
You probably don't even make it to the second leg

48:44.280 --> 48:46.280
after you go through that femoral artery.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.280
No, we're going to go ahead,

48:47.280 --> 48:53.280
and it's a whole new kind of samurai move that you've invented here

48:53.280 --> 48:58.280
of taking a circular saw through the thigh in order to...

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
Die?

48:59.280 --> 49:03.280
Ritually commit sudoku.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.280
God dammit.

49:04.280 --> 49:09.280
Or the Cubs announcer.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.280
God dammit.

49:11.280 --> 49:14.280
Oh my God, why do we think about that?

49:14.280 --> 49:16.280
Zach, that's a terrible Harry Caray.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.280
That was Nick Nichols.

49:17.280 --> 49:20.280
I know.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
What's Harry Caray sound like?

49:21.280 --> 49:24.280
Like that.

49:24.280 --> 49:26.280
He gets a little more breathless.

49:26.280 --> 49:31.280
Yeah, Harry Caray watching the baseball game and calling the play.

49:32.280 --> 49:40.280
Musical guest, Harry Caray.

49:40.280 --> 49:44.280
What is the last thing that goes through Keith's mind before he dies?

49:44.280 --> 49:53.280
A bunch of worms.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.280
Planet Juggernaut, how do you land?

49:55.280 --> 49:59.280
Okay, so Planet Juggernaut was kind of in his big arcing path

49:59.280 --> 50:04.280
around the Gigantopropithecus when the rest of team good guy,

50:04.280 --> 50:10.280
we think, baby, team our world, really stepped up

50:10.280 --> 50:12.280
and knocked that fucker out.

50:12.280 --> 50:18.280
So Planet Juggernaut kind of sees this and starts swinging back around.

50:18.280 --> 50:23.280
He adjusts his path, and he's heading towards Mary in the portal.

50:23.280 --> 50:24.280
A hundred percent.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.280
So go ahead and roll.

50:26.280 --> 50:28.280
I think we can make this happen this turn.

50:28.280 --> 50:29.280
Oh, right.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.280
So can he get to her this turn?

50:30.280 --> 50:31.280
Uh-huh.

50:31.280 --> 50:33.280
Okay, so he's going to try to just take her out.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.280
Land on her?

50:34.280 --> 50:39.280
Yeah, or just flatten her, just like he's heading right towards her.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.280
69.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.280
It's a 69.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.280
Oh, my God.

50:44.280 --> 50:47.280
It's a straight 69.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.280
Oh, my God.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.280
That's fucking amazing.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.280
Describe this dinner for two, baby.

50:55.280 --> 50:59.280
So Mary has dropped Rosemary, right?

50:59.280 --> 51:00.280
That's right.

51:00.280 --> 51:04.280
Okay, so it's a ball focusing all its energy onto this portal.

51:04.280 --> 51:07.280
Yeah, it's got all of its tendrils except for two plugged in

51:07.280 --> 51:10.280
because those two had been lasered off previously.

51:10.280 --> 51:14.280
Mary is so focused on forming this portal

51:14.280 --> 51:16.280
and bringing Tilda into this world

51:16.280 --> 51:22.280
that she does not really notice the shadow that starts looming overhead,

51:22.280 --> 51:24.280
getting bigger and darker.

51:24.280 --> 51:28.280
And just as she thinks she's about to pull it through,

51:28.280 --> 51:32.280
she's at her moment of utmost concentration.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.280
Everything ends for Mary.

51:34.280 --> 51:36.280
Everything goes black.

51:36.280 --> 51:42.280
There's no more consciousness, no more pain, no more struggle.

51:42.280 --> 51:43.280
The mission is over.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.280
Mary is over.

51:45.280 --> 51:50.280
The rest of the people in this weird world feel everything around them

51:50.280 --> 51:55.280
reverberate as Planet Juggernaut crashes into the ground,

51:55.280 --> 52:00.280
completely eliminating the portal, the Mary,

52:00.280 --> 52:05.280
and it kind of pillows into the soft surface of this space.

52:05.280 --> 52:08.280
And you don't hear the sound that you think you should

52:08.280 --> 52:13.280
as it's kind of absorbed into the floor of this world a little bit

52:13.280 --> 52:16.280
like you jumped on a soft pillow

52:16.280 --> 52:20.280
and it comes to a rest over the space where Mary used to be.

52:20.280 --> 52:25.280
One Keith Vigna, two Clark Bishops, one Planet Juggernaut,

52:25.280 --> 52:31.280
one Ball named John, and an AT-ST holding the Dawn

52:31.280 --> 52:34.280
exist out of combat.

52:34.280 --> 52:39.280
And as Zack, the bald, mustachioed man sitting across from you,

52:39.280 --> 52:45.280
continues to describe this group of people on this alternate plane,

52:45.280 --> 52:48.280
figuring out what they're going to do next.

52:48.280 --> 52:53.280
You notice the walls of this room swiftly change color and placement.

52:53.280 --> 52:58.280
Suddenly, one wall is covered in a moving blanket that's been nailed up

52:58.280 --> 53:01.280
to keep the daylight out of this baseball-themed room.

53:01.280 --> 53:04.280
The adjacent walls have been painted Cardinals Red

53:04.280 --> 53:07.280
with the St. Louis skyline and Busch Stadium,

53:07.280 --> 53:11.280
and five friends sit around a desk and a table,

53:11.280 --> 53:14.280
each with a microphone in front of their mouths.

53:14.280 --> 53:17.280
Next to this enthusiastically narrating Zack

53:17.280 --> 53:21.280
sits a chortling Justin with thick, curly hair,

53:21.280 --> 53:23.280
clear frames on his glasses,

53:23.280 --> 53:28.280
and a consistent giggle that reflects his compassion and tenderheartedness.

53:28.280 --> 53:31.280
The chuckles continue as an in-character joke

53:31.280 --> 53:36.280
is nimbly slipped in by this sharp, well-bearded Thomas,

53:36.280 --> 53:41.280
who finger guns a Luke who is wearing a cute top and sick new shoes

53:41.280 --> 53:46.280
and a hat that is both abstract and completely made out of leather.

53:46.280 --> 53:51.280
And this comedically verdant Luke looks up into the sky and says,

53:51.280 --> 53:53.280
Hell yeah.

53:53.280 --> 53:57.280
He says that at the exact moment a charming, punctual Joe Terry

53:57.280 --> 54:00.280
with long, windswept-in-a-nice-way hair

54:00.280 --> 54:03.280
brings the group back to the story with a sentence

54:03.280 --> 54:06.280
that is somehow both equally in and out of the story,

54:06.280 --> 54:12.280
which leads this thankful Zack, distressingly unaware of me or you or any of us,

54:12.280 --> 54:17.280
back into this group's current contention story,

54:17.280 --> 54:22.280
in which the filter on the colorization changes as we all see the city.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.280
Everything is drab and gray with a sickly green tint to it.

54:26.280 --> 54:29.280
The streets are covered in trash and spilled liquids.

54:29.280 --> 54:32.280
There's a scent in the air like someone left out cheese

54:32.280 --> 54:35.280
and a colostomy bag on every corner.

54:35.280 --> 54:39.280
The faces of the buildings are slathered in billboards

54:39.280 --> 54:44.280
and the faces of the people bumbling about would be bloated and lifeless

54:44.280 --> 54:47.280
if there were any people here, but there are not.

54:47.280 --> 54:51.280
In a strange opposition to this depressive scenery

54:51.280 --> 54:54.280
there are beautiful flowers in every shade and shape

54:54.280 --> 54:57.280
growing in every otherwise empty alleyway

54:57.280 --> 55:01.280
and out of many cracks in the sidewalks and roads.

55:01.280 --> 55:05.280
You all get the sense that this is some sort of nighttime,

55:05.280 --> 55:08.280
though the stars are bright enough to light the sky.

55:08.280 --> 55:13.280
Perhaps the people who live here are merely asleep or elsewhere.

55:13.280 --> 55:18.280
And suddenly countless different versions of a group of contention police officers

55:18.280 --> 55:21.280
fighting off some wild threat begin to appear from portals

55:21.280 --> 55:25.280
placed pervasively throughout this city.

55:25.280 --> 55:28.280
So I like to imagine the first group is clearly

55:28.280 --> 55:32.280
Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore IV, Keith Vigna, and some sort of animal friend

55:32.280 --> 55:37.280
all in astronaut suits, extravehicular mobility units

55:37.280 --> 55:39.280
for you trivia people.

55:39.280 --> 55:43.280
But along with these four there's a mind-shatteringly immense creature

55:43.280 --> 55:46.280
squeezing its way into this existence.

55:46.280 --> 55:52.280
This belief-wrecking monstrosity smells like rain and smoke

55:52.280 --> 55:55.280
and the dried sweat of a loved one.

55:55.280 --> 55:57.280
And it reminds you of a time you felt safe.

55:57.280 --> 56:00.280
The next group through one of these many portals

56:00.280 --> 56:05.280
is three myriad agents wearing pinstripe suits and trilby hats

56:05.280 --> 56:10.280
blowing on whistles that sound like they say FBI when blown.

56:10.280 --> 56:17.280
And they're chasing these four versions, these like mobster versions

56:17.280 --> 56:22.280
of John, Keith, Clark, and whatever Justin is playing in this.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.280
What would you look like?

56:24.280 --> 56:28.280
Clark's wearing trousers with suspenders and a white shirt and a fedora.

56:28.280 --> 56:33.280
And the white shirt doesn't fit quite right so the top few buttons are unbuttoned.

56:33.280 --> 56:38.280
And maybe one of the suspender straps is a little bit dangly.

56:38.280 --> 56:41.280
It's not quite fit right. And he's disheveled.

56:41.280 --> 56:47.280
John is wearing a sleek black zoot suit with a large fedora.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.280
And he's got a Tommy gun.

56:50.280 --> 56:54.280
And he kind of shoves the disheveled Clark on by.

56:54.280 --> 56:58.280
Come on guys, we gotta go. Book it, Keith.

56:58.280 --> 57:06.280
Keith has a white cotton tank top on with some black dress pants that are quite big.

57:06.280 --> 57:08.280
You know.

57:08.280 --> 57:11.280
Like all of ours, it's the style of the time.

57:11.280 --> 57:16.280
And he's got his tie around his head like a drunk guy at a wedding.

57:16.280 --> 57:18.280
Yes, yes.

57:18.280 --> 57:25.280
I do want to describe all of our ties which are somehow impossibly thick and pointy and short.

57:25.280 --> 57:27.280
Like those crazy 40s ties.

57:27.280 --> 57:29.280
Justin, what is your character wearing?

57:29.280 --> 57:35.280
My character is all of the nickels together wearing the exact same tuxedo.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.280
Nick, Nick, Dick, and Rick.

57:41.280 --> 57:44.280
Yeah, all four of them are all together holding hands running.

57:44.280 --> 57:47.280
Like the memes of the biblical angels.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.280
Yes, there's just so many eyes.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
Yeah.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.280
And microphones.

57:53.280 --> 57:56.280
Yeah, they all have old timey microphones.

57:56.280 --> 57:59.280
You guys want to do one more variation on a theme or no?

57:59.280 --> 58:00.280
Sure.

58:00.280 --> 58:02.280
What is happening?

58:04.280 --> 58:12.280
We are playing a game in a different game where we're playing the game in the city

58:12.280 --> 58:21.280
where all these portals are opening up in the empty city and all of these different versions from different versions of...

58:21.280 --> 58:26.280
We're meeting the versions of ourselves that alternate universes, versions of ourselves have created.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.280
That's exactly right.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.280
Into a shared game space.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.280
Yeah.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.280
Which is the city.

58:30.280 --> 58:31.280
Love it.

58:31.280 --> 58:34.280
And so the next group that comes in is...

58:34.280 --> 58:37.280
They're all out of a Willy Wonka style situation.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
Yes!

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
Okay, yes.

58:39.280 --> 58:47.280
Yeah, so they're all being chased by this crazy man who is wearing two different top hats.

58:47.280 --> 58:51.280
One's purple and one's green and they're both staying on his head for some reason.

58:51.280 --> 58:55.280
And he's got pirate vibes.

58:55.280 --> 59:06.280
He's got a pirate shirt on underneath a long tuxedo where the tail on the coat is actually 14 yards long.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.280
That's right.

59:07.280 --> 59:10.280
42 feet long and...

59:17.280 --> 59:22.280
And what is Keith Vigna's Wonka character?

59:22.280 --> 59:26.280
His clothes are just made out of banana Laffy Taffy.

59:29.280 --> 59:31.280
Is he eating it as he's running?

59:31.280 --> 59:33.280
He's chewing on the suspenders.

59:33.280 --> 59:34.280
Keith isn't running.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.280
Keith is in the bed that we're pushing.

59:36.280 --> 59:41.280
And as soon as the guy catches up, he leaps up and spryly runs out.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
You get a Wonka, Justin?

59:46.280 --> 59:48.280
You get a Wonka character?

59:48.280 --> 59:49.280
A Wonka character?

59:49.280 --> 59:50.280
Yeah.

59:50.280 --> 59:57.280
What about there's a beautiful cotton candy outfit of some kind?

59:57.280 --> 59:59.280
Some kind.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.280
Is that the Wonka?

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.280
Is that a Wonka?

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.280
That's the Wonka.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280
Is that a Wonka?

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.280
Clark's wearing a black turtleneck and he has a monocle.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.280
Oh, yeah.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.280
He was one of the parents of the children.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.280
Yeah, that's perfect.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.280
He got swept away after his child got taken.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.280
And he's just following these people who seem like they know how to get out of here.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:29.280
A small purple John Lee Pettymore holding a Tommy gun turns around and starts opening fire on the thing chasing them.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:35.280
We keep doing this and every time John has a Tommy gun.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:42.280
That's actually crazy because I wrote a thing in here where he doesn't have one.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.280
Oh, wow.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.280
Yeah, I know.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.280
I know.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.280
It's wild.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.280
Did you imagine?

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:58.280
My final one is that busting through one of these portals into this weird city scene is Keith Beans in an Olympic style wrestling leotard.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:04.280
Clark Bishop wearing a crown made of flowers with a guitar strapped to his back.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:12.280
And you both look like you have what are oversized paper clips aimed directly at a John ball.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:17.280
And at the end of each of these metal tendrils, what do you have?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.280
Just a bunch of myriads with Tommy guns.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:31.280
And they're just like, Clark, Keith, we only want to help as they blast bullets their way.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:45.280
And as these five first class friends forged further into their fiction, another equally charismatic and likable group, us, us again, we're talking about us.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:52.280
We're back in this room talking to each other and dealing with...

01:01:52.280 --> 01:02:00.280
Zach, I don't want to freak your dick, but that's where we've been this whole time.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.280
Consider my dick freaked.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.280
Roll sanity.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:14.280
Suddenly, you're all standing on this luminous land, free from the restraints of combat, looking around at each other.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:31.280
When a sound like a swelling sea surf surrounds you and smothers your senses as an actual swelling sea surf consisting of cramped small-scale xenonematodes begins collapsing down toward you.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.280
It has not stopped. It will continue. You are running out of time.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:45.280
Thanks for wasting all our time with that alternate world shit.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.280
It was like a round and a half. We could have been fighting those nematodes.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.280
We could have been doing so much.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.280
Shut up, Zach. Come on.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:14.280
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.280
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:29.280
What kind of world are you living in?

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:53.280
What kind of world are you living in?

01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:02.280
What kind of world are you living in?
