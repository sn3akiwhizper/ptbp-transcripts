00:00.000 --> 00:09.840
Well, well, well, I see y'all are crawling back for more Wolf the Dog, and it don't matter

00:09.840 --> 00:17.640
if I'm broadcasting in contention, the city, or anywhere else in the galaxy, everybody

00:17.640 --> 00:20.640
always wants a taste of ol' Wolfy Boy.

00:20.640 --> 00:30.640
Well, I am here hittin' you live from 694.2 PTBP to let y'all feast upon my mouth sounds.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.480
I hope it's real satiatin' for y'all.

00:35.480 --> 00:41.320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Dr. Colossus, who is an honorary police officer

00:41.320 --> 00:47.080
on our Patreon and a member of the community over on the subreddit.

00:47.080 --> 00:53.600
They tagged atpretendingpod in a tweet, which is just about the sweetest thing to ol' Wolf.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.920
Dr. Colossus writes,

00:55.920 --> 00:59.280
Time for ol' Wolf to come clean, my pups.

00:59.280 --> 01:05.400
The audio adventures of the contention PD are just a cover to distract from my own insidious

01:05.400 --> 01:09.240
efforts to dominate the national radio landscape.

01:09.240 --> 01:15.320
Today contention, tomorrow the city, later on the world.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.400
I can tell you this now because it's too late to stop it.

01:19.400 --> 01:25.880
There's nowhere to hide as my hypnotic suggestions surf the electromagnetic waves straight into

01:25.880 --> 01:29.900
your ear holes and hack your brain stems.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.760
My dominion is nearly absolute.

01:32.760 --> 01:38.520
Remember, the trigger phrase is plate of foot meat.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.700
Thank you, Dr. Colossus, for ruining the surprise.

01:42.700 --> 01:48.620
My producer and I were going to start by buying out all the local radio stations in

01:48.620 --> 01:56.020
every small town so that Wolf the dog could have a grassroots movement of domination.

01:56.020 --> 02:00.000
Then I'd begin the persuasion.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.220
Real nice, real slow, you see.

02:03.220 --> 02:05.580
I got time.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.580
There's no one else for them to even listen to.

02:09.580 --> 02:15.660
Draw them all in with hunnied words and promises of infinite foot meat.

02:15.660 --> 02:22.620
Then, when the time was right, well, y'all just gonna have to wait and see, I guess.

02:22.620 --> 02:27.620
Remember, if you want to write up something for your old wolf to how, tag at Pretending

02:27.620 --> 02:33.700
Pod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star

02:33.700 --> 02:39.260
review and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

02:39.260 --> 02:45.380
Y'all, I need that positive motivation from you beautiful people because life in the city

02:45.380 --> 02:46.780
is strange.

02:46.780 --> 02:50.900
Yesterday, I saw two pigeons eating a rat.

02:50.900 --> 02:55.700
Whenever I went over to try and scare them away, they hissed at me like a rabid raccoon

02:55.700 --> 02:57.700
before skittering off.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.300
They didn't even fly, y'all.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.020
They just ran away real fast.

03:02.020 --> 03:06.860
Please remember, my dear listeners, we got ourselves a Patreon now.

03:06.860 --> 03:11.380

03:21.900 --> 03:27.100
Apple store and write a review on iTunes from every phone and tablet on display in the whole

03:27.100 --> 03:33.420
fuckin' place, and while you're there, grab that aux cord that's connected to the speaker

03:33.420 --> 03:38.100
system and warn everyone that shit is about to slap.

03:38.100 --> 03:57.540
It's KOTSU with no bap-a.

03:57.540 --> 03:58.540
Spank me.

03:58.540 --> 03:59.540
Flank me.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.540
Call me stanky.

04:02.540 --> 04:06.460
Stinky.

04:06.460 --> 04:10.380
That means you yourself admit it yourself that you love your mother-in-law.

04:10.380 --> 04:14.140
Are you ready?

04:14.140 --> 04:15.140
Yeah.

04:15.140 --> 04:19.340
John Lee Pettymore, you are standing outside a storage unit.

04:19.340 --> 04:23.580
A massive yellow symbol has been spray painted on the door.

04:23.580 --> 04:29.160
The symbol is a wonky question mark with two lines, one curved and one straight, jutting

04:29.160 --> 04:31.860
down from the question mark's dot.

04:31.860 --> 04:38.260
The storage unit door slides up, and inside is the thick brush of well-wooded land.

04:38.260 --> 04:40.880
In the distance, you see a small cabin.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.580
Looking down, your hands are covered in blue paint, and you are holding one of those small

04:45.580 --> 04:47.280
silver spheres.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.180
It feels warm in your hands.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.580
It has a nice weight to it.

04:51.580 --> 04:54.860
And then you see a sky of endless darkness.

04:54.860 --> 05:00.020
Far out in front of you, through this thick and terminable nothing, you see two children

05:00.060 --> 05:05.240
standing completely still, holding hands, and you hear the sounds of torment.

05:05.240 --> 05:11.900
Agony and loss in an audio medium, you lose the ability to see, smell, feel anything as

05:11.900 --> 05:16.100
the wretched noise overwhelms your senses.

05:16.100 --> 05:23.140
You open your eyes, and you're staring up at a ceiling, and you look to the left, you

05:23.140 --> 05:26.340
look to the right, and you see corpses.

05:26.340 --> 05:34.300
And it smells overwhelmingly like blood and viscera and death and shit, other bodily fluids

05:34.300 --> 05:36.700
spilled out.

05:36.700 --> 05:40.380
You see the body of John Lee Pettymore IV.

05:40.380 --> 05:44.300
Your body, but not your current body.

05:44.300 --> 05:51.980
And you see the body of Rich Nichols, the man that led you from room to room in this

05:51.980 --> 05:54.580
layer of Marvin Glass.

05:54.580 --> 05:55.580
What do you do?

05:55.620 --> 05:59.460
I look down at my new body, and what do I see?

05:59.460 --> 06:04.620
Well honestly, the body of Kevin, or as we'll call him, John Lee Pettymore.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.340
I guess I'd like to find a mirror.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.340
Okay.

06:07.340 --> 06:14.940
One of the files in this room, one of the file cabinets, has the front of it is actually

06:14.940 --> 06:18.500
reflective, extremely reflective.

06:18.500 --> 06:27.540
Looking in, you see this man who is, he looks like a broken version of your daddy that you

06:27.540 --> 06:35.180
knew from when you were a child, a very young child, but he is much older.

06:35.180 --> 06:39.940
He may be my father, but he ain't my daddy.

06:39.940 --> 06:46.700
You see you have you to now have surgical scars all down your neck and jawline on either

06:46.700 --> 06:56.100
side and these crazy eyes, and you're just an older man, basically the same build, you

06:56.100 --> 06:59.540
still have a mustache, you know there's a lot of similarities.

06:59.540 --> 07:03.980
I want to look at my old body and see where I came out of.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.980
Oh yeah.

07:04.980 --> 07:11.740
So it's very clear that you came out of the back of the neck.

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
Okay.

07:12.740 --> 07:13.740
What do I feel like?

07:13.740 --> 07:17.780
Do I feel like a person or like something wrapping itself around a host?

07:17.780 --> 07:19.860
Well you feel like you've always felt.

07:19.860 --> 07:20.860
Okay.

07:20.860 --> 07:21.860
Makes sense.

07:21.860 --> 07:27.580
So I, John Lee Pettymore kind of shudders as he looks at his old body.

07:27.580 --> 07:32.260
I want to, I want to basically pretend to be Kevin as long as I can.

07:32.260 --> 07:33.260
Okay.

07:33.260 --> 07:39.620
So let's discuss the mechanical changes out of character for John Lee Pettymore the third.

07:39.620 --> 07:40.620
Yeah.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.660
What am I now?

07:42.660 --> 07:47.980
So as I've described on the last two episodes for the other boys, we have, we've decided

07:47.980 --> 07:54.980
to adapt some of the rules from Pulp Cthulhu, fold them into this campaign and in doing

07:54.980 --> 08:02.260
so, we have given each of the PCs two talents from the Pulp Cthulhu rule book.

08:02.260 --> 08:07.940
Thomas, you chose quick healer and this game we roll one D four to get new hit points for

08:07.940 --> 08:13.780
each day and in your case you'll get one D four plus three every day.

08:13.780 --> 08:17.180
And then you also chose clairvoyance.

08:17.180 --> 08:24.020
Basically how we're going to do that is I'm going to trust you to not use this every second

08:24.020 --> 08:25.020
that we're playing the game.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.020
That's a mistake.

08:26.020 --> 08:29.100
Yeah, I think that's fair, but here's what I'm gonna allow you to do.

08:29.100 --> 08:36.140
You can spend 10 luck at any point in time to like dive into your internal self and have

08:36.140 --> 08:37.140
a vision.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
Cool.

08:38.140 --> 08:42.100
Also with your, uh, with your character for the stuff you hit a breaking point yesterday

08:42.100 --> 08:43.100
as well, I believe.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.620
Um, no, I've got 22.

08:46.620 --> 08:47.620
As your breaking point?

08:47.620 --> 08:51.020
No, 20 is my breaking point and it's, it's very hard to see.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.020
Right.

08:52.020 --> 08:55.220
So that means you're actually extremely close to your 28.

08:55.220 --> 08:56.380
There's no way that's a 28.

08:56.380 --> 08:57.380
It's a 22.

08:57.380 --> 08:58.380
Okay.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.620
So you're extremely close to your third breaking point.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.060
What happens on your third breaking point?

09:02.060 --> 09:05.100
Well, we will hit that when we get there.

09:05.100 --> 09:09.620
However, on your, uh, on your first breaking point, when we did that, we had the idea that

09:09.620 --> 09:14.540
you were going to have to put your life in danger to save others.

09:14.540 --> 09:19.100
Basically you were going to throw yourself in harm's way to, to save others.

09:19.100 --> 09:24.800
And if you didn't, then there would be a willpower disadvantage for you the next day that is

09:24.800 --> 09:32.760
going to be subsumed by this next breaking point situation, which is when you roll sanity,

09:32.760 --> 09:39.000
if you fail and the role would also fail on a power check, what's your power 60.

09:39.000 --> 09:47.080
So if you roll on a sanity check and you roll over 60, then you are going to split into

09:47.080 --> 09:51.080
a mind and a body at odds with each other.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.720
Okay.

09:52.720 --> 10:00.120
And that is a, uh, a load of role-playing that I am heaping onto your very, uh, capable

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
talents.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.120
All right.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
I believe in you.

10:03.120 --> 10:08.600
Let's remember that mechanic.

10:08.600 --> 10:14.240
You walked into this room and it was filled with filing cabinets and my file was sitting

10:14.240 --> 10:15.240
out open.

10:15.240 --> 10:20.920
John Lee Pettymore IV's file was sitting out open on the table as was a file regarding

10:20.920 --> 10:23.920
some people that ended up being Kevin.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.440
As you were like getting up and looking around this room in your new body, you hear a voice

10:29.440 --> 10:33.520
from behind you, Hey, Kevin, come on.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.040
Marvin wants to talk to us.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.120
So without saying anything, I just told up one finger, like, wait a second.

10:39.120 --> 10:44.040
And I want to real quick see if, um, I can find a file for Clark and Keith.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.040
Okay.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.880
Go ahead and roll search for me.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.880
35.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.920
Uh, let's see what my search is.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
50.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.920
All right.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
Then you were good.

10:54.920 --> 11:00.560
And actually, um, in your new body, we're going to up your hit points and willpower

11:00.560 --> 11:04.840
all the way to full full for a John Lee Pettymore full for John Lee Pettymore.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.840
Okay.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.800
We're going to keep all your mix.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.800
Yeah.

11:08.800 --> 11:09.800
All your takes after his dad.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.800
Yeah, exactly.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.640
Ooh, that puts me up to 20 hit points and 12 willpower.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.640
Okay.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.960
So yeah, I passed the search rule.

11:16.040 --> 11:21.160
So you open this most reflective file cabinet and it just so happens to have three file

11:21.160 --> 11:23.400
names that catch your eye.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.360
One says Clark Bishop and it is completely empty.

11:28.360 --> 11:33.260
Another says Keith Vigna and it too is completely empty.

11:33.260 --> 11:39.320
Both of these file folders are, they're like extremely crisp and new.

11:39.320 --> 11:45.800
Then like the third folder you find titled the contention PD, which is so worn, it is

11:45.800 --> 11:50.120
turned a noticeably different color, uh, opening it.

11:50.120 --> 11:57.520
You see a lot of recent news stories, file clippings, uh, newspaper clippings that are

11:57.520 --> 12:04.600
cut out and put into this folder and they all have to do with the police force and whether

12:04.600 --> 12:10.480
or not you guys weren't handling missing persons cases or you were firing weapons into

12:10.480 --> 12:14.920
the air in public or you were harassing citizens.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.840
There are plenty of news articles written about the contention PD that have come out

12:19.840 --> 12:25.600
in the past three or four days that have been grouped into this folder.

12:25.600 --> 12:33.640
Uh, John Lee Pettymore, the third and fourth letters of fake news, um, and, and stashes

12:33.680 --> 12:36.080
the file back where he found it and follows Rosemary.

12:36.080 --> 12:43.480
So you guys go out the hallway into the elevator and I want to, I want to try out Kevin, like

12:43.480 --> 12:45.720
some spy craft as Kevin.

12:45.720 --> 12:50.080
So I'm just going to be like, uh, how you doing Rosemary?

12:50.080 --> 12:56.440
Well, uh, everything's going exactly as planned, so pretty fucking good Kevin.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.680
That's that's great.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.560
It's not out of character for me to ask you how you're doing, is it?

13:00.560 --> 13:04.840
I mean, we haven't chatted like this in years, but well, it's a good day.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
Everything's going as planned.

13:05.840 --> 13:06.840
Yeah.

13:06.840 --> 13:07.840
I wasn't going to question it.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.840
What part of the plan are we at?

13:08.840 --> 13:09.840
What do you mean?

13:09.840 --> 13:11.320
Where are you on your part of the plan?

13:11.320 --> 13:13.880
I know where I am, but what have you, what have you accomplished?

13:13.880 --> 13:19.000
Well, I think that's why we're, uh, I think that's why we're going to see Marvin for us.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.480
He's probably going to send us to go collect the money now.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.480
Great.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.480
Perfect.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.480
Yeah.

13:24.480 --> 13:28.760
So you guys make it to the top of the, uh, elevator ride and the door opens and there's

13:28.760 --> 13:34.960
a long hallway and at the end of the hallway, there is a 10 by 10 slab of black marble and

13:34.960 --> 13:41.020
four guards, two on either side of the enormous and strange door that slowly slides open as

13:41.020 --> 13:42.020
you approach.

13:42.020 --> 13:47.240
And the guards are in full brown jumpsuits and they each have a large scythe strapped

13:47.240 --> 13:48.240
to their backs.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.280
And the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook.

13:51.280 --> 13:56.800
A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.200
Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.400
Their noses do not jut out, but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped

14:05.400 --> 14:06.480
mouths.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.920
And they have a few flaps on either side of their necks.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.920
Fish man.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.920
Walking into this.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.320
I knew it.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.320
This whole time.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.320
I knew it.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.320
It was the fish.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.320
All right.

14:19.320 --> 14:23.880
When you walk into this room, you see it's the size of a basketball court to your left.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.880
One of the long walls is entirely made of glass.

14:26.880 --> 14:32.640
And there is murky greenish water on the other side, like an aquarium, but it's of staggering

14:32.640 --> 14:33.640
proportions.

14:33.640 --> 14:40.200
Marvin Glass is standing behind a table, arms folded behind his back, staring off into the

14:40.200 --> 14:41.200
distance.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.560
And again, he is just massive and gaunt all at the same time.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.240
And he is still wearing that fitted black tuxedo that you've seen him before.

14:49.480 --> 14:56.160
And when you turn, you see his weird hole in his face where his mouth should be is still

14:56.160 --> 14:59.320
just covered in this circle of red lipstick.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.360
And that hole begins moving.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.440
Hello, Kevin.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.920
Hello, Rosemary.

15:05.920 --> 15:06.920
And Nod.

15:06.920 --> 15:12.320
You have been doing excellent work for me recently.

15:12.360 --> 15:21.160
And we are moving into the final phase of contentions demolition.

15:21.160 --> 15:25.360
I need the two of you to go retrieve.

15:25.360 --> 15:31.520
And as he's saying this, you notice that behind them, there are these windows and you see

15:31.520 --> 15:35.600
lights, just like crazy lights, just like shining in and off.

15:35.600 --> 15:40.680
It looks like there's something happening in that room behind him, but you can't quite

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
tell what it is.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.960
Whatever it is, there's a lot of movement with the lights and it's getting out of control

15:46.960 --> 15:47.960
back there.

15:47.960 --> 15:48.960
Kevin, thanks.

15:48.960 --> 15:53.560
I'll probably hear that in another episode.

15:53.560 --> 16:02.140
Looking around the room, you see that on Marvin's desk, there is one of those small silver spheres

16:02.140 --> 16:08.520
sitting on like a little tripod holder that's holding it up.

16:08.520 --> 16:13.800
That's awesome because I knew he had one from the tape and now I don't have to go looking

16:13.800 --> 16:14.800
for it.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.800
It's right there.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.840
You can see it.

16:16.840 --> 16:23.840
And he continues on saying the money, as Rosemary said, and Rosemary cuts in.

16:23.840 --> 16:33.780
Yeah, let's see, there's $5 million in the police station and then there's $5 million

16:33.780 --> 16:38.240
at the house of one of the police officers.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.960
That is extremely good work, Rosemary.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.800
I just have one request on your way to contention.

16:47.800 --> 16:53.600
I need you to go check in on a new venture I've begun.

16:53.600 --> 17:01.640
You see, Stan Manstein, his daughter's funeral is today.

17:01.640 --> 17:08.680
I believe it begins rather shortly and he will be out in the world for the first time

17:08.680 --> 17:11.540
in a very long time.

17:11.540 --> 17:19.720
I have sent your new Charles, Keith Vigna, one of the officers from the contention police

17:19.720 --> 17:26.080
department, to go bring Stan Manstein back to me.

17:26.080 --> 17:34.720
Rosemary and Kevin, I need you to go make sure that our new family member completes

17:34.720 --> 17:36.320
his job.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.880
Not again.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.880
Kevin thinks it's very appropriate that Vigna is the new Charles considering he killed the

17:41.880 --> 17:42.880
first one.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.320
Oh shit, I didn't even think about that.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.320
That's so good.

17:47.320 --> 17:52.920
He's like, that's justice for Keith in some small measure.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.400
While we're all still in front of Marvin Glass, I want to clear my throat.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.000
He turns quickly and looks at you.

18:01.000 --> 18:10.140
I heard Rosemary brought the gun instead of the money we're going to get.

18:10.140 --> 18:12.040
Why'd you do that, Rosemary?

18:12.040 --> 18:19.120
They both look at you and Rosemary turns and starts laughing.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.480
I know I'm not very quick, but...

18:21.480 --> 18:26.480
And she looks at Marvin and she's like, that's why we don't trust old Kevin here with making

18:26.480 --> 18:28.360
the plans, huh, sir?

18:28.360 --> 18:29.920
And Marvin laughs.

18:29.920 --> 18:43.440
I guess so.

18:43.440 --> 18:48.520
My attempt to shame Rosemary in front of Marvin has failed miserably.

18:48.520 --> 18:56.720
I was really trying to sow some division, but nope.

18:56.720 --> 18:57.720
I think you did great.

18:57.720 --> 19:03.560
So he kind of, with a flick of his hand, waves you off and the door moves back out of the

19:03.560 --> 19:10.640
way and you guys take the elevator back up to the top after loading up with some heavy

19:10.640 --> 19:13.080
artillery, I would assume.

19:13.120 --> 19:18.480
Rosemary, you know I'm because of what they've done to my brain.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.680
I don't remember the plans too well.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.680
Why did you get the gun instead of the money?

19:23.680 --> 19:29.560
Well, okay, well, I already got in a shootout with those police officers and they did not

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
stop.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.200
Like, I thought for sure that they were going to keep going until they just blew my brains

19:34.200 --> 19:36.320
onto the concrete.

19:36.320 --> 19:40.340
And I don't trust them to have not stopped the second time.

19:40.340 --> 19:44.300
And so I obviously not wanting to get shot, I hate getting shot.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.940
You know, I hate getting shot.

19:45.940 --> 19:49.380
So I, you know, just figured that was the easiest way.

19:49.380 --> 19:55.060
Kevin grunts, but John Lee Pettymore or the thing that was John Lee Pettymore is pretty

19:55.060 --> 19:57.940
pleased that she was like actually intimate.

19:57.940 --> 20:01.340
Like we were something of a force to be reckoned with at least.

20:01.340 --> 20:02.340
Right.

20:02.340 --> 20:03.340
Yeah.

20:03.340 --> 20:04.340
Some sort of fry.

20:04.340 --> 20:08.660
We, yeah, we made some small impact in her plans.

20:08.660 --> 20:14.460
So as you guys, uh, the elevator opens and then all of a sudden you are just standing

20:14.460 --> 20:21.580
in an alleyway in the city and the sun is shining in kind of bright from the, from a

20:21.580 --> 20:30.080
low angle and there's fog in this alleyway and you look over and you see a group of raucous,

20:30.080 --> 20:35.200
like rowdy people, like people that you wouldn't expect at 10 AM, but maybe in the city that's

20:35.200 --> 20:36.320
more normal.

20:36.320 --> 20:40.960
There's at least 12 of them and they all walk up to this, uh, this alleyway that you're

20:40.960 --> 20:47.740
in and there's a large grate on the ground and they all stand on it and they all hold

20:47.740 --> 20:53.600
up their dirty dog key fobs at the same time and the grate seems to disappear and they

20:53.600 --> 20:56.640
all just fall straight down into it.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.980
Interesting.

20:57.980 --> 21:01.600
These dirty dog passes, they're like the key chains that John Peter said.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
Yeah.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.600
Okay.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.120
And that's sitting in lockup, evidence lockup most likely.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.120
Cool.

21:08.120 --> 21:15.200
Turning away from that, Rosemary clicks the beeper on her white Toyota and the two of

21:15.200 --> 21:20.640
you hop in and begin making your way to the city cemetery.

21:20.640 --> 21:37.080
Luke, after leaving this meeting with Marvin Glass, you head back down the hallway into

21:37.080 --> 21:43.680
the elevator that you came in on and you ride up to the top and it leads you back to the

21:43.680 --> 21:50.840
parking garage that you drove into when you came with your partners and Doug Jacobs and

21:50.840 --> 21:53.600
the body of agent Trent Chad and Rosemary.

21:53.600 --> 22:00.200
And when you arrive up there, there are still the same guards up there wearing suits and

22:00.200 --> 22:07.440
earpieces and your police cruiser from contention is also sitting exactly where it was before.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.560
Do I see any of my friends?

22:09.560 --> 22:10.880
No, you do not.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.160
I go over to the car and I get in.

22:13.560 --> 22:18.400
When you get into the car, you see that you had actually left your cell phone in here

22:18.400 --> 22:19.400
this whole time.

22:19.400 --> 22:28.880
I believe you're wearing a boat shoes and shoes, the oversized shorts that are teal.

22:28.880 --> 22:37.500
I think some sort of way too tight orange polo, so you look great and you get back into

22:37.500 --> 22:42.120
your cruiser and when you look at your cell phone, you see that you have a bunch of missed

22:42.120 --> 22:44.800
calls and a voicemail from Drew Andrews.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.200
Okay, I listen to the voicemail.

22:48.200 --> 22:55.120
Oh, fuck, Keith, Keith, Keith, you got to get somebody, somebody please answer somebody

22:55.120 --> 22:56.120
you guys.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
Oh, fuck everybody.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.400
It's everywhere now.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.620
You have to tell everyone, everyone, please, please, you have to get as far away.

23:02.620 --> 23:05.440
You have to get as far away as possible from here.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.520
It's growing.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.360
It's growing.

23:07.360 --> 23:13.460
I want to call Drew.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.120
When you call Drew, it goes straight to voicemail.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.120
Fuck.

23:17.120 --> 23:25.680
My first reaction is to drive back to contention, but he also said get away, but I got to go

23:25.680 --> 23:26.680
save Drew.

23:26.680 --> 23:27.680
Okay.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.920
Oh, do I have the camera with me?

23:29.920 --> 23:36.300
No, when you look inside the police cruiser, you find that it has been stripped of many

23:36.300 --> 23:38.580
of the items that you came here with.

23:38.580 --> 23:39.580
Okay.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.420
And then what did we, who is the gun?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.540
The gun's gone.

23:42.540 --> 23:44.100
The gun is gone for sure.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.100
Yeah.

23:45.100 --> 23:46.100
Okay.

23:46.100 --> 23:52.340
You've got some guns left, but not the gun, the tubed gun, not the tubed gun and the camera's

23:52.340 --> 23:53.340
gone.

23:53.340 --> 23:54.340
The camera's gone.

23:54.340 --> 23:55.660
The body armor's all gone.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.660
Okay.

23:56.660 --> 23:57.660
Yeah.

23:57.660 --> 23:58.660
You're just left with a couple of guns.

23:58.660 --> 24:03.060
And then Marvin actually gave you your small, powerful gun.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.060
When is this funeral?

24:04.300 --> 24:06.540
Oh, it starts in like half a night.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.260
You've just enough time to like make it there.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.260
Okay.

24:09.260 --> 24:14.220
I guess hopefully Drew calls me back or something, but I guess gonna head to this funeral if

24:14.220 --> 24:17.100
I have just enough time, I guess I can't go get my dress clothes on.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.500
So I'm going to be dressed for a different occasion, but.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.500
Styling.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.500
Yeah.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
Maybe stand out like a sore thumb.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.500
Maybe not.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.500
We'll see.

24:25.500 --> 24:31.020
So you, uh, you drive to the city cemetery and I don't know if Keith has been here before,

24:31.020 --> 24:33.220
but the city cemetery is all.

24:33.380 --> 24:34.740
Oh, it is in the city.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.740
It is in the city.

24:35.740 --> 24:36.740
Yeah.

24:36.740 --> 24:37.740
And it's all above ground.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.620
Oh, like a new Orleans style.

24:39.620 --> 24:40.620
Exactly.

24:40.620 --> 24:45.860
So there are, as you drive up, you park and then there are countless tombs winding aimlessly

24:45.860 --> 24:49.420
about creating all these odd little pathways.

24:49.420 --> 24:53.900
The mausoleums are just tall enough to look down on you as you pass through.

24:53.900 --> 24:58.660
And the morning fog adds an extra layer of disorientation.

24:58.660 --> 25:06.900
I'm kind of wandering through trying to find people and then I get a whiff of, is that,

25:06.900 --> 25:10.700
it smells like a crawfish boil.

25:10.700 --> 25:14.420
And I head to where the smell is coming from.

25:14.420 --> 25:20.380
And as you head to, as you follow your nose, you find that in a small clearing, there is

25:20.380 --> 25:26.700
a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein surrounded by these ornate and menacing graves.

25:26.700 --> 25:33.220
There are a handful of rows of chairs, all facing a small podium next to a coffin.

25:33.220 --> 25:37.820
And I'm going to hold up this whiteboard here and show you.

25:37.820 --> 25:39.060
Okay.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.580
Where would you like to...

25:40.580 --> 25:42.020
Are those seats?

25:42.020 --> 25:44.060
Yeah, the circles are seats.

25:44.060 --> 25:49.420
I want to go to the very front row on the very middle.

25:49.420 --> 25:50.420
Okay.

25:50.420 --> 25:52.700
You head toward the front row.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.020
Where's the crawfish boil pot at?

25:55.020 --> 25:56.020
It is...

25:56.540 --> 25:58.180
It's actually right in front of the coffin.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.180
Okay, cool.

25:59.180 --> 26:00.860
So once it's all done, I'll...

26:00.860 --> 26:01.860
You want to be first in line.

26:01.860 --> 26:02.860
I want to be first in line.

26:02.860 --> 26:03.860
Absolutely.

26:03.860 --> 26:10.420
And as you walk up there, Jan Manstein, the mother of Ari Manstein walks towards you to

26:10.420 --> 26:11.420
greet you.

26:11.420 --> 26:12.420
Oh my goodness.

26:12.420 --> 26:15.300
Oh, I just, I didn't think you would come or maybe I did.

26:15.300 --> 26:19.140
I thought maybe there was a chance that you weren't going to come, but you know, last

26:19.140 --> 26:23.620
minute and then I don't know where your partners are, but this is just, I couldn't be any happier

26:23.620 --> 26:28.540
or sadder technically, I guess I am at my daughter's funeral, but thank you.

26:28.540 --> 26:29.540
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

26:29.540 --> 26:33.060
The other police officers send their condolences.

26:33.060 --> 26:37.060
They're a bit incapacitated right now though, but I wouldn't miss it for the world.

26:37.060 --> 26:43.820
And she moves on flitting about to many of the other funeral attendees and you take a

26:43.820 --> 26:45.260
seat in the front row.

26:45.260 --> 26:45.780
Okay.

26:53.620 --> 26:57.620
All right, yeah, I'm good.

26:57.620 --> 26:58.620
Yeah, you are.

26:58.620 --> 26:59.620
One of the best, they all say.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.340
That's what literally everyone has agreed on.

27:02.340 --> 27:07.380
We all came together, put our thumb on the thing, showed that we pledged our allegiance

27:07.380 --> 27:08.380
to you.

27:08.380 --> 27:09.380
I appreciate it.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.380
Thank you.

27:10.380 --> 27:11.380
Thank you everyone.

27:11.380 --> 27:23.260
Clark, you just came to, on this table in the middle of this odd dungeon style room

27:23.820 --> 27:33.420
and you are looking at chief Maggie cook or Maggie cook now, and she backs away from you

27:33.420 --> 27:34.420
pretty quickly.

27:34.420 --> 27:41.220
As soon as the weird squamous, like worm like creature with the mouths is back in the ground,

27:41.220 --> 27:44.300
she steps back and she looks at you and she's, Oh, okay.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.300
I didn't expect that.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.300
Um, all right.

27:46.300 --> 27:53.020
So Clark, you, um, are you, how you.

27:53.020 --> 28:00.740
When you came back, I know we went over this, but how, how was it that you are still alive?

28:00.740 --> 28:04.380
I mean, your, your guess is as good as mine.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.060
In fact, I would hope it'd be better.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.060
Okay.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.580
Well I'll, I'll keep thinking on it and I'll let you know what I come to, but for now you

28:10.580 --> 28:11.620
need to get going.

28:11.620 --> 28:17.300
So basically as soon as you're finished up, you can do pretty much whatever.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.180
You can head back to contention.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.300
You can hang out in the city.

28:20.300 --> 28:25.540
We'll put you up here if you'd rather stick around and be close, but this job isn't a

28:25.540 --> 28:28.780
daily situation or it won't be at first.

28:28.780 --> 28:34.460
We'll get you trained up and, uh, working more and more often, but for now you can pretty

28:34.460 --> 28:40.340
much go back to contention, get your affairs in order and, uh, pack up everything because

28:40.340 --> 28:43.180
your life there, it doesn't, doesn't have to stay there.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.380
You can, you can move here.

28:44.380 --> 28:49.140
You can, you can move wherever you need to be and, uh, and we'll, we'll stay in contact

28:49.140 --> 28:50.500
with you either way.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.220
You said it's not a daily thing.

28:52.220 --> 28:59.780
I mean, the thing I saw, it, it, it shook me to my core, Maggie, I'll make it a daily

28:59.780 --> 29:00.780
thing.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.780
Let's, let's stop it.

29:01.780 --> 29:02.780
Let's make it not be.

29:02.780 --> 29:03.780
All right.

29:03.780 --> 29:04.780
All right, Clark.

29:04.780 --> 29:05.780
I like your passion.

29:05.780 --> 29:06.780
I like your fire.

29:06.780 --> 29:10.540
This is exactly what we need in this organization right now is fire.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.740
All right.

29:11.740 --> 29:18.180
So take this and she pulls a burner phone out of her pocket and she hands it to you.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.420
Take this and I'll be in contact with you.

29:20.420 --> 29:23.340
I'll, I'll, I'll hit you up tomorrow and I'll make sure that we get going.

29:23.340 --> 29:24.340
All right.

29:24.340 --> 29:28.900
Hey, hey Maggie, do you know anything about my partners?

29:28.900 --> 29:32.020
No, no I don't.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.380
They dropped off the radar about when you did.

29:35.380 --> 29:39.140
So I have no idea what they're up to.

29:39.140 --> 29:45.260
If they're, uh, if they're still with us and I had the opportunity, would you be willing

29:45.260 --> 29:47.580
to take them into the circle with us?

29:47.580 --> 29:48.580
Do you think they're ready?

29:48.580 --> 29:51.300
I mean, they've seen the same things I have.

29:51.300 --> 29:53.300
Yeah, but are they ready?

29:53.300 --> 29:55.700
I don't know Maggie.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.900
Will you be the judge of that?

29:57.900 --> 29:58.900
Let me know.

29:58.900 --> 30:04.700
All right, Clark, you being a part of this, that means I trust you.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.620
We're going to rely on each other a whole lot moving forward.

30:07.620 --> 30:10.580
So if you say they're ready, then I believe you.

30:10.580 --> 30:11.580
All right.

30:11.580 --> 30:17.460
I, I, I thank you Maggie and I hope you know that I've always, always trusted you.

30:17.460 --> 30:24.980
I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have stuck around in that, that, that dead end job.

30:24.980 --> 30:30.620
Well Clark, you're not at a, well, I guess you are still in a bit of a dead end job.

30:30.620 --> 30:34.300
If poor choice of words, Maggie, at the end, we're all going to be dead.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.340
So in order for that not to happen, let's get you moving.

30:37.340 --> 30:38.340
All right.

30:38.340 --> 30:43.020
And so she leads you back up top, back into the parking lot of the mill and sets you up

30:43.020 --> 30:44.220
with a car.

30:44.220 --> 30:49.900
It's a little silver Honda Accord and she hands you the keys.

30:49.900 --> 30:57.220
What gear did you decide to bring from the, from the room that we were just in?

30:57.220 --> 30:59.940
That room that spawned anything and everything that I would ever need.

30:59.940 --> 31:00.940
Of course.

31:00.940 --> 31:01.940
Yeah.

31:01.940 --> 31:02.940
What'd you pick up?

31:02.940 --> 31:06.060
All a news, a gun.

31:06.060 --> 31:09.300
You guys have all those old contention police department uniforms in there.

31:09.300 --> 31:12.220
I went ahead and got my old uni, an old uniform of mine.

31:12.220 --> 31:13.220
Amazing.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.140
I'm afraid in it still.

31:15.140 --> 31:20.060
And uh, Oh, you got any of those, uh, Leon gave me this gun that shot these tranquilizer

31:20.060 --> 31:22.860
darts that made people do things.

31:22.860 --> 31:24.100
You got any of those left?

31:24.100 --> 31:25.100
You know what?

31:25.100 --> 31:27.380
Uh, we are actually out of that serum right now.

31:27.380 --> 31:31.900
We just used the last of it to make sure we could get the federal Bureau of investigation

31:31.900 --> 31:32.900
on our side.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.920
We thought that might be quite important.

31:34.920 --> 31:40.260
Do you have any leftover from when you were doing that or I believe, uh, the glass family

31:40.260 --> 31:42.140
now possesses that item.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.140
The glass family.

31:43.140 --> 31:44.140
Oh boy.

31:44.140 --> 31:45.140
Okay.

31:45.140 --> 31:51.220
Well then this thing is a bit more convoluted than I, Hey Maggie, can I know why I'm killing

31:51.220 --> 31:52.220
Stan?

31:52.220 --> 31:53.220
Yeah.

31:53.220 --> 31:54.220
He needs to die.

31:54.220 --> 31:55.220
Okay.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.500
Is that good enough for you right now?

31:57.500 --> 31:59.640
I guess it's going to have to be.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.020
And she turns around and walks back to the mill.

32:03.020 --> 32:04.020
Cool.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.020
Cool.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.020
Cool.

32:06.020 --> 32:11.260
So, uh, you hop in the car and you're heading off to the city cemetery and the car is actually

32:11.380 --> 32:12.380
low on gas.

32:12.380 --> 32:16.460
So you have to stop and fill it up on the way over there.

32:16.460 --> 32:21.180
And while you're filling it up, I need you to roll an alertness check for me.

32:21.180 --> 32:23.380
Ooh boy.

32:23.380 --> 32:25.500
I pass a 32 on a 70.

32:25.500 --> 32:32.340
So you feel this movement behind you as you're filling up this car, your car now, and you

32:32.340 --> 32:38.740
turn around just in time to see that something has been dropped into the passenger seat of

32:38.740 --> 32:46.860
your car from a woman who is now 10, 15 yards away and is running away from you.

32:46.860 --> 32:48.860
Can I get any sense of who she is?

32:48.860 --> 32:50.260
Any chance I've seen her before?

32:50.260 --> 32:51.260
Just from the back.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.420
It is an average build woman with dark hair.

32:54.420 --> 32:57.880
I'm peeking in through my, the window I'm closest to, to see what's been dropped.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.620
It looks like a cell phone.

33:00.620 --> 33:02.620
Huh.

33:02.620 --> 33:05.020
I go around and pick it up.

33:05.020 --> 33:09.880
You walk around the car, open the door, pick up the cell phone and the cell phone immediately

33:09.880 --> 33:12.940
buzzes with a text message.

33:12.940 --> 33:18.940
And it says, do you want to know why your parents were killed?

33:18.940 --> 33:21.940
Joe just made the funniest face.

33:21.940 --> 33:28.260
It was like a, Ooh, mixed with like a what?

33:28.260 --> 33:32.740
Uh, boy, I don't know.

33:32.780 --> 33:39.180
I, uh, first of all, before I reply to anything, I want to do a, just a quick little look through

33:39.180 --> 33:40.300
the menus on this phone.

33:40.300 --> 33:41.460
Do I see anything else?

33:41.460 --> 33:45.240
Old text messages, a sign of a phone number anywhere, contacts.

33:45.240 --> 33:49.540
Looks like this phone is completely blank except for this one text that is now in your

33:49.540 --> 33:50.540
inbox.

33:50.540 --> 33:52.060
I just reply, who is this?

33:52.060 --> 33:53.060
Okay.

33:53.060 --> 33:58.360
And then you hop back in the car and head back on your way to the city cemetery.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.880
And when you arrive, uh, I don't know if Clark has been to the city cemetery before, but

34:03.880 --> 34:07.160
it is all above ground mausoleums and such.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.160
Exactly.

34:08.160 --> 34:14.400
So you pull up to a parking lot and then you walk in to the city cemetery underneath this

34:14.400 --> 34:20.760
big gate that like old like iron rot that kind of spells city cemetery in the gate and

34:20.760 --> 34:27.820
you walk through and you're now in these windy, endless seeming walkways that you're surrounded

34:27.820 --> 34:32.960
by these tall tombs and mausoleums on either side that are looking down on you and it's

34:32.960 --> 34:35.660
morning and there's fog all through.

34:35.660 --> 34:36.660
Cool.

34:36.660 --> 34:37.660
Yeah.

34:37.660 --> 34:47.620
And, uh, eventually you, um, you smell this, um, fishy scent, this seafood scent of some

34:47.620 --> 34:48.620
sort.

34:48.620 --> 34:53.820
It smells almost like a, like a new Orleans party in the cemetery and you follow your

34:53.820 --> 34:57.020
nose to a small clearing.

34:57.020 --> 35:05.260
And my feet lift up off the ground and I float.

35:05.260 --> 35:10.260
And as you approach, you can see that there in the distance, uh, there's a small clearing

35:10.260 --> 35:16.380
and inside the clearing there's a funeral service set up for Ari Manstein, a handful

35:16.380 --> 35:22.060
of rows of chairs and they're all facing a podium next to a coffin.

35:22.060 --> 35:26.220
And you can probably see from where you're at, you're far enough away to where no one's

35:26.220 --> 35:30.600
really paying attention to you so far, but looking in and you see Jan Manstein, the mother

35:30.600 --> 35:36.260
of Ari and you see Keith Vigna and he is wearing Sperry's boat shoes.

35:36.260 --> 35:42.620
I believe a blue coral shorts that are very small or big.

35:42.620 --> 35:45.540
I can't quite remember.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.260
And then I think they're too big.

35:47.260 --> 35:48.260
That would make sense.

35:48.260 --> 35:53.140
And then a, uh, like an orange polo that is extremely tight.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.100
I don't know necessarily.

35:55.100 --> 35:58.340
You don't know why he's wearing that, but that is what he's wearing.

35:58.340 --> 36:01.800
How's he looking physically like in the face and maybe even his hair.

36:01.800 --> 36:07.300
He looks pretty good from the, from a distance, you know, you can't really see, but you were

36:07.300 --> 36:10.900
in the cage when you watched him die.

36:10.900 --> 36:15.540
So this might be a confusing sight for old Clark Bishop.

36:15.540 --> 36:19.380
Then again, you've been through some stuff.

36:19.380 --> 36:26.680
You yourself perhaps might have an inkling that it's easier than you thought to come

36:26.680 --> 36:28.060
back from the other side.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.060
Who knows?

36:29.060 --> 36:30.060
Oh, this makes sense.

36:30.060 --> 36:32.100
So basically this is the setup.

36:32.100 --> 36:37.540
I'm holding up a whiteboard with the setup and Keith is on the front row in front of

36:37.540 --> 36:38.540
the coffin.

36:38.540 --> 36:44.920
Uh, in front of the coffin, there is a crawfish crawdad boil going on, which is causing the

36:44.920 --> 36:49.680
scent to be overwhelming in this area.

36:49.680 --> 36:53.240
Is that as weird to Clark as it is to Joe?

36:53.240 --> 36:55.280
It's as weird to you as it is to me.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.280
Okay.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.280
Yep.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
Good.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.420
I didn't know if that was a tradition that you knew about that I don't.

37:00.420 --> 37:06.360
It's the classic city ritual that everyone knows about.

37:06.360 --> 37:10.040
It was in your, uh, it was in your package that you were supposed to read before you

37:10.040 --> 37:11.040
came in today.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.040
Yeah.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.040
Uh, Zach, it was a hundred pages.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.600
I wasn't going to do that.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.040
I just want you to be prepared.

37:17.040 --> 37:22.040
So basically I, I, I need you to pick a spot to set up a where you're going to be.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.100
You can, you know, so is there a crowd?

37:24.100 --> 37:25.100
There is a crowd.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.100
There is a crowd.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.280
Do I see Stan?

37:27.280 --> 37:28.280
You don't.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.400
I'm going to not sit.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.360
I'm going to stand toward the back of the chairs.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.360
Okay.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.840
You know, in a movie when the guy goes to the funeral that doesn't want to be seen at

37:35.840 --> 37:40.400
the funeral and he's kind of amongst the trees, but he's not, he's not hiding per se.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.400
Sure.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
That's what I'm doing.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.620
So you're amongst the trees, but there are no trees.

37:44.620 --> 37:50.260
So are you in the back in open sight of everyone or are you going to kind of creep behind some,

37:50.260 --> 37:52.760
some like one of the tombs that's nearby?

37:52.760 --> 37:57.880
You could probably like hide behind a column or just like stand up against the column.

37:57.880 --> 38:01.680
I don't want to be conspicuous enough that if somebody saw me, they would say, why is

38:01.680 --> 38:02.780
that guy hiding?

38:02.780 --> 38:06.080
So maybe more like just blending casually.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.200
Maybe I'm leaning against a monosmoselium nearby.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
Love it.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.200
Yeah.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.200
Nothing respects the dead like leaning on them.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Of course.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Okay.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Is my other partner there?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.160
Do I see John Lee Pettymore with Keith?

38:19.160 --> 38:21.800
You do not see John Lee Pettymore there.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.800
Oh, okay.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.520
Oh, they thought of me.

38:36.520 --> 38:46.000
So John Lee Pettymore, the third and fourth and Kevin and Kevin, you are, you are on the

38:46.000 --> 38:50.240
way to the city cemetery in the car with Rosemary.

38:50.240 --> 38:59.040
And as you're driving there, she says, I, uh, I didn't, I didn't know that Charles was

38:59.040 --> 39:02.760
dead until Marvin said that we'd replaced him.

39:03.000 --> 39:10.080
And then I just looked it up on my phone and I saw that he, he died in contention.

39:10.080 --> 39:14.840
And I know that the officers, the police there, they told me that they killed him, but I didn't

39:14.840 --> 39:15.840
know.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.280
I didn't know that they were serious.

39:17.280 --> 39:20.160
I thought they might've been lying to try to get me to talk or something.

39:20.160 --> 39:27.800
I didn't, I just didn't know that he was going to actually die.

39:27.800 --> 39:32.120
I didn't know that you cared for nobody but yourself and the glass boy.

39:32.120 --> 39:38.320
Oh, it's just, you know, he had the same, he had the same modifications done.

39:38.320 --> 39:43.440
So I just thought that, you know, we were a little bit more robust than that.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.440
Is that where are you?

39:44.440 --> 39:49.000
I'm not that philosophical Rosemary, but okay.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.200
I don't, I was trying to just suss out, but like how articulate was Kevin?

39:53.200 --> 39:54.920
So you guys actually never heard him talk.

39:54.920 --> 40:02.080
I would imagine that a guy like that is quite broken, but still easily like you can communicate

40:02.080 --> 40:03.160
easily.

40:03.160 --> 40:07.240
I would imagine you're not going to keep him around if he's just a dog on a leash basically.

40:07.240 --> 40:13.480
So he, I think he's far more far more eloquent than even say Rosemary, you know, cause she's,

40:13.480 --> 40:17.480
she's when you're, when you're right next to her, you see that she's got some scars

40:17.480 --> 40:20.320
on her as well and she's able to keep up.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
Got cool.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.800
So she has had the same shit done, but yeah.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.800
Gotcha.

40:23.800 --> 40:24.800
Okay.

40:24.800 --> 40:25.800
All right.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
Hold on.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.640
John, John Lee Pettimore talks like this and then you fuck up his body and his mind

40:29.640 --> 40:32.280
and you put a bunch of years on it.

40:32.280 --> 40:43.600
Rosemary, I'm not that philosophical, but did you think we, we couldn't die?

40:43.600 --> 40:45.360
Everything dies.

40:45.360 --> 40:51.520
And you guys pull up to the city cemetery and the city cemetery is all above ground.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.520
Like New Orleans.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.520
Exactly.

40:53.520 --> 40:58.540
So you pull into a parking lot and the two of you begin walking through all these different

40:58.540 --> 41:04.420
mausoleums and these little pathways that are winding endlessly to and fro about.

41:04.420 --> 41:09.640
And it's morning and the sun's coming in at a low angle on this fog that is perpetuating

41:09.640 --> 41:12.680
all throughout this entire cemetery.

41:12.680 --> 41:19.340
As you're walking through you, you smell this like nice seafood, like crawfish, like scent,

41:19.340 --> 41:20.340
like New Orleans.

41:20.340 --> 41:22.100
It smells like New Orleans.

41:22.100 --> 41:29.440
And following the scent, the two of you see from a distance, you hear a large group of

41:29.440 --> 41:33.860
people and you see that there's a small clearing ahead where there's a funeral service set

41:33.860 --> 41:36.460
up for Ari Manstein.

41:36.460 --> 41:41.500
And it is surrounded by all these ornate and these, these menacing, these tall graves,

41:41.500 --> 41:46.420
these tombs that are completely encasing this, this little clearing.

41:46.420 --> 41:51.440
But inside there are a handful of rows of chairs that are all facing a small podium

41:51.440 --> 41:52.720
next to a coffin.

41:52.720 --> 41:56.080
And in front of the coffin is the crawfish boil.

41:56.080 --> 42:00.240
You see that there is a Keith Vigna sitting on the front row.

42:00.240 --> 42:01.240
How does Keith look?

42:01.240 --> 42:02.460
Has he been modified?

42:02.460 --> 42:08.640
From where you are, you can't tell whether he has been quote modified, but you can see

42:08.640 --> 42:16.200
that he has regained an eyeball and his jaw, that he has regained his eyeball and his jaw.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.500
And so that is different.

42:17.500 --> 42:23.900
And he's also wearing a very tight fitting orange polo, like bright orange polo and these

42:23.900 --> 42:27.980
massive coral shorts.

42:27.980 --> 42:29.540
What's Keith's bod like?

42:29.540 --> 42:31.500
He's still wearing those big pants.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.420
Yeah, you still got him.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.780
What's he like under that tight, tight polo?

42:36.780 --> 42:38.220
Stringy, I think.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.220
Yeah.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.220
Beanie.

42:40.220 --> 42:41.220
Beanie.

42:41.220 --> 42:47.100
He's got a lean muscle on him, you know, he's like a horse.

42:47.100 --> 42:50.020
That seems like a high compliment.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.140
He's like a stringy horse.

42:52.140 --> 42:54.420
It's like a sick horse.

42:54.420 --> 42:56.580
In a polo.

42:56.580 --> 43:00.100
I would love to see horses play polo.

43:00.100 --> 43:02.620
Wait, on top of other horses?

43:02.620 --> 43:05.900
No, that wouldn't work, but if they carried the sticks in their mouths.

43:05.900 --> 43:09.620
I was picturing horses on people who are running.

43:09.620 --> 43:14.220
It wouldn't work, Zach, but if you glued a stick to a horse's mouth and taught him to

43:14.220 --> 43:15.220
whack a ball.

43:15.220 --> 43:20.580
I think they would invent polo naturally.

43:20.580 --> 43:24.220
It's probably the first game they come up with.

43:24.220 --> 43:29.140
Anthropologists look at horse cultures and see if they've come up with polo to determine

43:29.140 --> 43:30.700
how advanced they are.

43:30.700 --> 43:31.700
Horsey culture.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.500
See, you and Rosemary are looking for...

43:33.500 --> 43:34.500
Horsey culture.

43:34.500 --> 43:35.500
Did you see that Brony documentary?

43:35.500 --> 43:36.500
Thankfully, no.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
Don't you mean they?

43:37.500 --> 43:38.500
Oh, no.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.500
I'm sorry.

43:39.500 --> 43:49.540
So, you see there are these handful of rows of chairs and Keith is up front.

43:49.540 --> 43:52.660
He's sitting in the very front row in front of the coffin.

43:52.660 --> 43:58.460
And as you continue to look around, go ahead and roll a search for me.

43:58.460 --> 43:59.980
84, fail.

43:59.980 --> 44:07.960
You notice there are lots of people here for the funeral and in the back, leaning up against

44:07.960 --> 44:11.520
one of the mausoleums is Clark Bishop.

44:11.520 --> 44:18.640
He is wearing an old contention police uniform, like an older model of the contention police

44:18.640 --> 44:20.680
department uniform.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.440
And he is just leaning casually in the very back.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.440
What do you want to do?

44:24.440 --> 44:27.280
Oh, first of all, is Stan Manstein in attendance?

44:27.280 --> 44:30.520
Stan Manstein is not in attendance currently.

44:30.520 --> 44:35.440
So I say to Rosemary, looks like our new boy didn't get his job done.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.520
I'm going to circle the perimeter and check things out.

44:38.520 --> 44:43.940
And I want to make my way towards the so-called Clark Bishop in this old uniform.

44:43.940 --> 44:45.600
Does he look natural?

44:45.600 --> 44:47.800
Is his stance Clark's stance?

44:47.800 --> 44:49.440
Yeah, absolutely.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.440
It looks like Clark.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.440
Do I still have?

44:51.440 --> 44:53.440
No, John died in his underwear.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.920
He didn't have a cell phone.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.560
John died in his underwear.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.720
Shot by his daddy.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.240
Where do you want to set up?

45:03.240 --> 45:08.200
Rosemary is like, I think I'm going to get some higher ground over here.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.560
She is going to climb on top of one of the mausoleums.

45:11.560 --> 45:15.280
And she's like, I'm just going to lay flat and watch.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.900
That looks real dumb.

45:16.900 --> 45:24.480
You look very conspicuous, but I've learned to trust your methods in our many years together.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
Nailed it.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
Convincing.

45:26.480 --> 45:31.360
So yeah, I want to walk behind or just walk near and around that Clark Bishop.

45:31.360 --> 45:36.880
I want to be kind of unseen and I want to cough bubblegum tree in the middle of a crowd

45:36.880 --> 45:37.880
and see if he looks.

45:37.880 --> 45:38.880
Okay.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.480
Go ahead and roll stealth for me.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.480
Yeah.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.580
81.

45:45.580 --> 45:46.580
My skill is 50.

45:46.580 --> 45:47.580
Okay.

45:47.580 --> 45:48.580
Yeah.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.580
We don't even need a mirror.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.880
I want to get behind just some people near him and kind of like play in the penis game

45:52.880 --> 45:54.760
just like bubblegum tree, bubblegum tree.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.760
Okay.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.760
Yeah.

45:56.760 --> 45:57.760
That's great.

45:57.760 --> 45:58.760
Does he look?

45:59.160 --> 46:02.000
I I'm should I go ask him?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Maybe.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Yeah.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
All right.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
I'll be right back.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Okay.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
All right, Joe.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Hey there.

46:19.000 --> 46:28.000
Clark Bishop is leaning up against this mausoleum and from behind him, he hears bubblegum tree.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.880
I whip around.

46:29.880 --> 46:35.440
When you turn around, there's a crowd around standing around before the funeral service

46:35.440 --> 46:37.080
actually begins.

46:37.080 --> 46:42.360
And there are people both like in front of and to the side and behind you through the

46:42.360 --> 46:45.040
small crowd behind you.

46:45.040 --> 46:49.240
You notice a face that you recognize.

46:49.240 --> 46:56.520
It's the face that you saw standing at the bar when you're in the cages hanging in that

46:56.520 --> 47:02.160
God forsaken room in Marvin Glass's place.

47:02.160 --> 47:08.480
It is Kevin, the security guy, the one who was kind of unaffected by the scene.

47:08.480 --> 47:09.480
Yes.

47:09.480 --> 47:10.480
Gotcha.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.480
I see him.

47:11.480 --> 47:12.480
Does he see me?

47:12.480 --> 47:13.480
Yeah.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.480
He's staring straight at you.

47:14.480 --> 47:19.200
I'm, I'm, uh, Oh fuck.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.160
I'm looking to see if I, anybody I know is with him.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.360
It doesn't look like it.

47:23.400 --> 47:27.520
I look straight at Kevin bubble gum tree.

47:27.520 --> 47:33.600
Kevin looks away and continues walking through the crowd.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.120
Oh shit.

47:53.360 --> 48:22.000
Oh my, the only one trying to fool all, how can you have enough drowning out of the noise.
