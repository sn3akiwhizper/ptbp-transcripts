00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Greetings, greetings, my fellow canines, my pups, my pack.

00:05.760 --> 00:14.720
You are listening to 694.2 PTBP, Contentions best radio show hosted by Wolf the dog.

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
That's me baby.

00:15.720 --> 00:21.560
I'd like to introduce a brand new segment today, and we're gonna call it Howlin' with

00:21.560 --> 00:22.600
Wolf.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.360
If you listeners out there would like any of your announcements read on air each week

00:26.360 --> 00:31.820
by yours truly, I had to read anything these people send me.

00:31.820 --> 00:35.400
Apparently yes, it can be anything.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.440
Tell me your thoughts about what them boys are up to, promote your new business, tell

00:40.440 --> 00:45.840
your best friend Becky that she's really been nailing it lately, or just go ahead and say

00:45.840 --> 00:48.560
hi to your best pal Wolf.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.960
Okay well, then you can enter up to four times by doing one of the following.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.800
One, leave us a five star review on your podcast platform of choice.

00:57.800 --> 01:05.800
Two, three, and four, make a post and tag us on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter.

01:05.800 --> 01:11.800
You can find us on Instagram and Twitter at pretending pod or look up pretending to be

01:11.800 --> 01:14.540
people on Facebook.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.800
Eat my ass Mark Zuckerberg.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.220
Nah, each time you do one of these we'll put your name in a bowl.

01:21.220 --> 01:25.780
Each week me or one of my minions will draw a name and that person will be able to write

01:25.780 --> 01:31.900
an announcement to be read by your local canine DJ Wolf the dog.

01:31.900 --> 01:36.660
Now I'm just gonna let y'all know my producer told me to read all that, but what the fuck

01:36.660 --> 01:38.560
is a podcast?

01:38.560 --> 01:45.920
Now for a little news, says right here them boys done fucked up.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.300
Now speaking of fucked up, we got a banger for y'all today.

01:49.300 --> 01:53.100
It's kazoo with no backbone.

02:19.300 --> 02:47.300
Oh, come on, it's all about the build up.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.380
Wow, enough of that.

02:52.380 --> 03:07.780
So that song plays over the drone shot of you all of us crying and then we would see

03:07.780 --> 03:16.220
one police cruiser and a raggedy four wheeler come pulling back into the contention police

03:16.220 --> 03:23.300
department parking lot and the three of you go inside.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.100
Well we're back in the police station.

03:27.100 --> 03:32.340
Can I first aid myself to see if I can set my foot back in and strap that boot back on

03:32.340 --> 03:33.620
and just leave it be?

03:33.620 --> 03:35.860
Let's drop you off at the hospital.

03:35.860 --> 03:37.300
Let's get professional medical attention.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.980
I kind of like the idea of me doing it.

03:39.980 --> 03:40.980
What do you want to do Keith?

03:40.980 --> 03:45.940
I want to just see if I can't set it back in where I think it might be and then wrap

03:45.940 --> 03:49.540
it up and then put my boot back on and then just go from there.

03:49.540 --> 03:52.700
Go ahead and roll a first aid for me.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.700
That's a nine.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.780
You nailed it.

03:54.780 --> 04:02.100
With an actual first aid kit handy and perhaps a leather strap to bite down on, you set your

04:02.100 --> 04:05.380
ankle back into place and get your boot back on.

04:05.380 --> 04:08.020
I think Clark is real disturbed.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.020
We would have just taken you to the hospital man.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.020
We don't have time.

04:11.020 --> 04:12.700
Let's get, let's do some more investigating.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.700
Oh, all right.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.340
I have to prove myself dude.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.900
Is he losing hit points or anything?

04:16.900 --> 04:18.380
I gain hit points from that probably.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.980
Yeah, you do actually roll a D4 for me.

04:20.980 --> 04:21.980
Oh yeah.

04:21.980 --> 04:22.980
Come on baby.

04:22.980 --> 04:23.980
Two.

04:23.980 --> 04:26.260
Yeah, go ahead and grab two hit points.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.460
What is your first aid Luke?

04:27.460 --> 04:28.460
60.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.640
Oh nice.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.640
He said 60.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.060
It's qualified.

04:33.060 --> 04:39.900
And as you guys are sitting around, Drew says, oh, by the way, I meant to tell you guys,

04:39.900 --> 04:47.660
I called in and checked with the city PD about the death of Jim Cook, Maggie's dad.

04:47.660 --> 04:51.220
It's pretty brutal actually.

04:51.220 --> 04:57.020
He was murdered in an alleyway the night of December 1st.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.980
He was strangled and died of asphyxiation.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.740
Didn't you say you had a dream about an alleyway?

05:03.740 --> 05:05.580
As a matter of fact, I did.

05:05.580 --> 05:08.780
And you had a dream about an old woman strangling people?

05:08.780 --> 05:10.020
No, not an old woman.

05:10.020 --> 05:14.660
She was an old timey lady throwing me through the floor.

05:14.660 --> 05:16.180
Even spookier.

05:16.180 --> 05:22.860
And did I see you guys pull up in that four wheeler, but did someone wreck the four wheeler?

05:22.860 --> 05:24.180
Yeah, I did.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.260
Yeah, I wrecked it.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.340
It was bad ass though.

05:28.340 --> 05:32.100
Right guys?

05:32.100 --> 05:33.620
Just could you take a look at that?

05:33.620 --> 05:34.620
Yeah.

05:34.620 --> 05:35.620
You know mechanical stuff, right?

05:35.620 --> 05:36.620
Yeah, absolutely.

05:36.620 --> 05:37.620
I'll take a look at it.

05:37.620 --> 05:43.220
And then now that Julie Maxwell is definitely not at her apartment, maybe we should go take

05:43.220 --> 05:44.220
a look at that.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.220
Do all three of you want to go?

05:45.220 --> 05:46.220
Yeah, I think so.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.220
Sure.

05:47.220 --> 05:55.400
I think it's best we stick together because if any of us got into this kind of trouble

05:55.400 --> 06:00.500
without people to help, I'm like...

06:00.500 --> 06:07.300
Okay so you get the address off of her ID that John Pettymore got a hold of when she

06:07.300 --> 06:09.220
was in her car accident.

06:09.220 --> 06:14.900
You head there and you pull up to a quadplex in the shitty neighborhood just northwest of

06:14.900 --> 06:18.980
downtown where Julie Maxwell rents a studio apartment.

06:18.980 --> 06:23.820
There's a sticky note on her door and I will hand it to you now.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.980
I just got a dick drawn on it.

06:26.980 --> 06:27.980
That's strange.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.980
What's it say?

06:28.980 --> 06:29.980
You weren't here.

06:29.980 --> 06:30.980
Still waiting for reply.

06:30.980 --> 06:32.260
Please help me.

06:32.260 --> 06:35.860
You know I've always thought it was weird that this place is called the shitty neighborhood.

06:35.860 --> 06:41.280
I feel like step one to raising property values in this place is changing that name.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.460
I knock on the door.

06:42.460 --> 06:48.940
As you knock on the door, the door opens and an odd chemical scent wafts out the door.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.580
Do I recognize this chemical?

06:50.580 --> 06:52.300
It opens from the power of his knock.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.620
Yeah, it was just clearly not closed very well.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.260
Is it like methy in here?

06:57.260 --> 06:58.260
Or like bleach?

06:58.260 --> 07:00.220
Yeah, a little bleach-y.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.220
Not so methy.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.780
A scent that John would know pretty well I bet.

07:04.780 --> 07:11.200
As you go inside, you find a bed, a desk with an old computer on it, and a large number

07:11.200 --> 07:14.740
of complete and incomplete taxidermied animals.

07:14.740 --> 07:20.020
Looking around further, you see an empty bottle of brandy, an old digital camera, taxidermy

07:20.020 --> 07:26.700
materials like tanning chemicals, pickling agents, bactericides, oils and such, a handful

07:26.700 --> 07:32.660
of pictures of Julie with her sister Ashley from before the accident, and a receipt from

07:32.660 --> 07:35.580
Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.660
Whoever has the best search, please roll search for me.

07:38.660 --> 07:39.660
I've got 50.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.660
Yeah, you're the best.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.080
32.

07:43.080 --> 07:48.100
As you are giving the apartment a quick go around, you find a phone book.

07:48.100 --> 07:52.100
It's flipped upside down underneath the bed, and flipping it over, you see the phone book

07:52.100 --> 07:59.100
was opened to the Yellow Pages for private practices, and Circled is an ad for Dr. Marie

07:59.100 --> 08:02.340
Jacobs, who is a family practitioner in contention.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.540
Hey John, you should take a look at that computer.

08:04.540 --> 08:05.540
Yeah, definitely.

08:05.540 --> 08:07.860
I want to look at that camera and that receipt too.

08:07.860 --> 08:08.860
Okay.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.420
Roll computer science.

08:10.420 --> 08:11.420
96.

08:11.420 --> 08:12.420
Well.

08:12.420 --> 08:15.980
My skill is 99, so I pass hand on it.

08:15.980 --> 08:16.980
It's awfully handy.

08:16.980 --> 08:20.540
You would see that the digital camera is broken that's sitting on the desk.

08:20.540 --> 08:21.620
Damn, it's broken.

08:21.620 --> 08:27.260
There are some recent Google searches on her computer for fixing broken digital cameras,

08:27.300 --> 08:30.060
and then moving on to where to find a new camera.

08:30.060 --> 08:31.940
She was looking into buying a new camera.

08:31.940 --> 08:38.980
The receipt from Forgotten Treasures is off an old register for, I don't know, $45.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.460
Let's go with $45.

08:41.460 --> 08:44.260
I also, before I move on to the camera, I'm going to pocket that memory card.

08:44.260 --> 08:45.260
Sounds good.

08:45.260 --> 08:49.140
Is there any memory card reader or input on the computer?

08:49.140 --> 08:50.140
Sure.

08:50.140 --> 08:52.660
I would like to see if I can see anything on it.

08:52.660 --> 08:55.220
A bunch of pictures of taxidermied animals.

08:55.220 --> 08:59.660
Can I spend the next four hours here trying to complete some of these unassembled taxidermies

08:59.660 --> 09:01.980
and really grind my taxidermy skill?

09:01.980 --> 09:02.980
Absolutely.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.980
Sweet.

09:03.980 --> 09:04.980
What is the mattress memory for?

09:04.980 --> 09:07.820
A little progress bar appears above my head as I just...

09:07.820 --> 09:08.820
Learn.

09:08.820 --> 09:09.820
Yeah, just stand.

09:09.820 --> 09:10.820
Is this just a one bedroom?

09:10.820 --> 09:11.820
Yeah.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.580
Does Clark know anything about Dr. Marie Jacobs just from being in the town?

09:14.580 --> 09:16.540
I don't think so.

09:16.540 --> 09:17.860
Any pictures or anything around?

09:17.860 --> 09:18.860
Oh yeah.

09:18.860 --> 09:22.980
They're all of Julie with her sister Ashley, so they're all from high school.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.020
Move on, you know?

09:24.020 --> 09:25.020
She is now.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.020
Thanks to Clark.

09:26.020 --> 09:29.060
Hey Clark, how do you feel about being in the home of the woman you brutally murdered

09:29.060 --> 09:30.060
yesterday?

09:30.060 --> 09:31.060
I mean, she murdered first.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.060
Hell yeah.

09:32.060 --> 09:33.060
All right, for an eye.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.060
Literally.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.060
Literally.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.140
Can you think of anything else to do in here?

09:36.140 --> 09:40.620
Clark is real interested in the taxidermy from a fan of taxidermy standpoint.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.620
Awesome.

09:41.620 --> 09:45.680
Guys, look at the scenes.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.100
The whole time that John and Keith are looking through stuff and trying to work on the computer,

09:51.100 --> 09:52.100
you're just...

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
Admiring the craft work.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.100
Wonderful.

09:54.180 --> 09:55.180
Good.

09:55.180 --> 10:00.860
Are there any deer heads in here that you could wear as like a funny prank or a disguise

10:00.860 --> 10:01.860
in the woods?

10:01.860 --> 10:02.860
Oh dude, yeah.

10:02.860 --> 10:03.860
Could we disguise ourselves?

10:03.860 --> 10:07.540
Is there enough deer components here for us to make deer disguises?

10:07.540 --> 10:11.920
I think you could probably come up with a headdress of some sort if you really took

10:11.920 --> 10:12.920
the time.

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
I take the time.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
Yeah, actually.

10:14.920 --> 10:18.420
It seems like we're dealing with some spooky shit, so we're going to spook right back.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.420
Okay, perfect.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.980
You guys can spend some time in here- Making three deer headdresses?

10:22.980 --> 10:26.780
Yeah, I mean if that's what you want to do- Well, I want a deer, do you guys want anything

10:26.780 --> 10:27.780
else?

10:27.780 --> 10:28.780
Ooh, yeah.

10:28.780 --> 10:29.780
Is there like a boar?

10:29.780 --> 10:30.780
Yeah, there's for sure a boar in here.

10:30.780 --> 10:31.780
What about a bobcat?

10:31.780 --> 10:33.700
There are three bobcat heads.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.700
What do you want to be, Clark?

10:34.700 --> 10:37.260
I am not participating.

10:37.260 --> 10:41.180
I make like a bobcat Cerberus.

10:41.180 --> 10:43.660
I'm just going to go with a deer.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.420
Clark, how are you reacting to them doing this?

10:46.420 --> 10:51.780
I would not let it happen, but I don't know if Thomas and Luke will not let me let it

10:51.780 --> 10:52.780
happen.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.700
Listen, Clark.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.700
We've seen some shit.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.700
What the fuck?

10:58.700 --> 11:00.700
You guys are putting shit on your heads.

11:00.700 --> 11:01.700
I know.

11:01.700 --> 11:02.700
Act like officers, boys.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.700
Hey, you know what?

11:03.700 --> 11:09.220
There's officers of man's law, and there's officers of spooky law.

11:09.220 --> 11:13.500
I go and take it off of your head, off of Jon's head, and just put it back on the table.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
We don't need this stuff.

11:14.500 --> 11:20.140
I have ahold of the deer antlers with my mask, and I say, you're not fucking touching me,

11:20.140 --> 11:21.140
Clark.

11:21.180 --> 11:24.060
It's a weird call to just set mine on the table, because I just pick it back up and

11:24.060 --> 11:25.420
walk out with it under my arm.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.580
I roll out of the apartment with my deer mask on.

11:28.580 --> 11:33.580
Clark, you are standing in the middle of the apartment of the woman you killed, and your

11:33.580 --> 11:37.580
two fellow officers have walked out with taxidermy hats.

11:37.580 --> 11:39.900
Sorry, one was a Cerberus.

11:39.900 --> 11:45.480
Well, it was a hat, but it's a spooky three-headed bobcat mask.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.480
How you feeling?

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
Not great.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.440
I think madness has taken my friends.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.440
Yeah.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.880
I'm okay if you want to throw a sanity roll at us for that decision we just made.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
No, you're good.

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
All right.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.440
Let's take that memory card and camera with us.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.440
I'll take that tray for a sweet bobcat.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.440
Wait, what kind of camera?

12:02.440 --> 12:04.120
What kind of camera was it?

12:04.120 --> 12:10.700
Remember before we had iPhones, and we all, a bunch of people had digital cameras that

12:10.700 --> 12:12.900
were about the size of an ID.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.160
What are you, a grandpa?

12:14.160 --> 12:15.160
It was one of those.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.360
Yes, my children have children.

12:16.360 --> 12:21.640
I want to take a picture of the apartment with it and see if it just takes a picture

12:21.640 --> 12:22.640
of the apartment.

12:22.640 --> 12:23.640
He said it's broken.

12:23.640 --> 12:24.640
Oh, it's broken.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.640
Well, darn.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.140
Let's take it back to Drew and see if he can fix it.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.440
We got the card off it.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.440
Yeah, that's true.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.040
Yeah, so unless you want a digital camera from 2008-

12:34.040 --> 12:35.040
I don't.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.440
Okay, what should we do next, boys?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.440
I kind of got caught up in that bobcat mask thing.

12:39.440 --> 12:40.960
What was on the SD card?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.520
It was pictures of the finished taxidermy.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
Right, okay.

12:44.520 --> 12:50.280
I think you figured out earlier in this game that she is a taxidermist, and so it's her

12:50.280 --> 12:51.280
Etsy page.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
Yeah, nope.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
Chuck Testa.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
Sweet meme.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.280
Oh, yeah, vintage.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.280
Vintage memes.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
What are you, a grandpa?

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
What?

12:58.280 --> 13:00.280
Yeah, his kids have kids.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
Pictures.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.840
We got two things we could go and look at here now.

13:03.840 --> 13:09.120
We can see if anybody at Forgotten Treasures remembers what she bought, and we could head

13:09.120 --> 13:12.320
over to the doctor's office and see if she has any information on why-

13:12.440 --> 13:13.920
Let's go to Hidden Treasures.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
Or Forgotten Treasures.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
Forgotten Treasures.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
Forgotten Treasures.

13:16.920 --> 13:17.920
Let's go there.

13:21.920 --> 13:25.180
All right, so you guys roll up to Forgotten Treasures.

13:25.180 --> 13:32.400
It is in the old neighborhood, two blocks west of, it's, no, it's, yeah, to the left.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
It's right there.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400
Yep.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.640
And it's an antique flea market.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.040
For people who don't know that we have a map, it sounds like you said to the left.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.040
Yep, there it is.

13:43.040 --> 13:51.320
We just go out on the balcony of Julie's, and the poor looking, no, no, oh.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.320
Just above that.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.320
Just to the left.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.320
There you go.

13:54.320 --> 13:55.320
You got it.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.320
You found it.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.320
To the left.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.320
To the left.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
All your shit in a box in the flea market.

13:59.320 --> 14:03.760
Okay, so you guys pull up, and it's almost closing time.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.760
Not for cops.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
I'm pretty much, yeah.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.000
What do you guys want to do?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Go inside.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.160
Okay, you go inside.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.160
You know what?

14:12.160 --> 14:13.160
That's what they're expecting.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.160
No, I don't have a better point.

14:16.160 --> 14:22.220
Okay, so you guys go inside Forgotten Treasures, and at the front, there seems to be a sort

14:22.220 --> 14:23.640
of office to your right.

14:23.640 --> 14:27.500
There's a big register area to the left where everybody checks out.

14:27.500 --> 14:33.200
There's one big register sitting on it, and an old woman standing behind it.

14:33.200 --> 14:39.880
And then looking forward, you just see a bunch of different rows of booths, individual booths.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.680
It smells kind of weird in here.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.000
Like old stuff.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Cool.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.920
Wait, so do we have ... We have a receipt from here?

14:47.920 --> 14:48.920
What was on the receipt?

14:48.920 --> 14:49.920
$45.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.920
It wasn't itemized.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.520
Okay, let's go up and talk to this lady and see if she remembers.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.480
Yeah, see if Julie came by a lot.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.480
Hello, ma'am.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
Hello?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Hi?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.480
We're three officers of the law, and we need some information from you.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.480
Oh my.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.480
Okay.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.480
Sure.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.480
Yes?

15:05.480 --> 15:06.480
Do you remember a lady named Julie Maxwell?

15:06.480 --> 15:07.480
Julie Maxwell?

15:07.480 --> 15:08.480
No.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
Pull up a picture.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.080
Yeah.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.080
We show her a picture.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
Oh, yes.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
Yes.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.320
She was in here, I don't know, maybe a week ago.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.720
Was she a frequent customer or just the one time?

15:19.720 --> 15:20.720
No.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.720
Do you recall what she purchased?

15:21.720 --> 15:22.720
Oh gosh.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.720
Oh gosh, what was it?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.720
It was an old camera.

15:27.720 --> 15:28.720
What booth?

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
504?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
I think.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
Yeah.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.720
Yeah.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.720
Polaroid?

15:33.720 --> 15:34.720
Seemed to be.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.720
I'd never seen anything like it before.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.600
It was a weird camera.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.280
What kind of things do they sell in this?

15:39.280 --> 15:41.320
As she's saying that, I'm going to head toward it.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.440
As she opens a book and starts flipping through it.

15:45.440 --> 15:49.760
That booth is owned by Mildred Mitchell?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.120
That's John Peters' neighbor.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.720
Clark, you're walking toward the booth.

15:52.720 --> 16:00.440
When you get there, it contains some old hippie records, some tie-dye clothes, and future

16:00.440 --> 16:01.440
paraphernalia.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.440
Future paraphernalia?

16:02.440 --> 16:03.440
Future paraphernalia?

16:03.440 --> 16:07.840
Yeah, like some pipes that will- For tobacco use only.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.320
For tobacco use only.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.960
Are there any other items like that camera or are they all pretty straightforward, nothing

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
too unusual?

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
Yeah.

16:17.960 --> 16:18.960
I don't know.

16:18.960 --> 16:26.000
There has been some, I guess, not too many people around here buy stuff from Mildred,

16:26.000 --> 16:31.600
but she had a few items come in pretty recently that all sold pretty quickly.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
How recently?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.080
Probably about a week ago.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.960
I think she looted John Peters' house.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
We need to go talk to her.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.360
Yeah, we need to find out how she got this stuff.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.120
Do you have any other cool booths?

16:41.120 --> 16:43.600
You might want to check out booth 420.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.000
Man, we are officers before war.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.720
Man, we're cops.

16:46.720 --> 16:50.320
It's all Elvis memorabilia.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
I'm a big fan.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.320
Well.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
Oh, you old hound dog.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.320
Crying all the time.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.280
I really want to go talk to Mildred.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.280
Let's roll.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.960
Let's head right to Mildred's.

17:01.960 --> 17:09.560
You guys pull up to Mildred's house and when she opens up the door, a cloud of smoke billows

17:09.560 --> 17:16.400
out of the door and she's like, oh, hey, uh, oh, officer, officers, uh, officers.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
I, uh, oh boy.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
Hey Mildred.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Hey.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
You having a good time there?

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
Hey Johnny.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
How are you doing?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
Uh, yeah.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.400
I, um.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
Not as good as you, I don't think.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.160
I'm so, I am, um, I'm sorry.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.740
Burning a little incense in here, are we Mildred?

17:30.740 --> 17:33.020
I just like the place to smell nice.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.020
Of course.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.260
Hey, do you mind if we step in and ask you a few questions?

17:36.260 --> 17:37.260
I don't know.

17:37.260 --> 17:38.260
By all means.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.260
Do you want some tea?

17:39.260 --> 17:40.940
And she, uh, starts walking back.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.300
What kind of tea?

17:42.300 --> 17:49.180
I've got green, chamomile, herbal, mint, peppermint, black, uh, blue, and, uh, green.

17:49.180 --> 17:50.860
I'll take one of them peppermints, man.

17:50.860 --> 17:52.380
I'll take the second green.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.940
I'll take the first green.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.940
Have some fun, Keith.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.260
All right, let's do it.

17:56.260 --> 17:58.980
She picks up a spliff off of her ashtray.

17:58.980 --> 17:59.980
Mildred.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.100
Oh, I, oh, shoot, I'm so-

18:02.100 --> 18:06.980
She's, like, embarrassed and puts it out, uh, and then goes back and, uh, comes back

18:06.980 --> 18:10.180
with some tea, uh, and sits down on the couch and is like-

18:10.180 --> 18:16.100
Oh, no, uh, what, what can I, uh, oh, ew, what can I, uh, do for you, officers?

18:16.100 --> 18:20.100
We don't want to go accusing nobody of nothing, Mildred, but, you know, when you noticed John

18:20.100 --> 18:25.700
had been missing, did you happen to maybe stock your booth with some of his things?

18:25.700 --> 18:26.700
My, my booth?

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
Down at the flea market?

18:29.700 --> 18:36.900
I totally forgot I had a booth at the flea market.

18:36.900 --> 18:40.940
Somebody restocked it about a week ago, Mildred, with some pretty interesting things.

18:40.940 --> 18:41.940
What?

18:41.940 --> 18:45.940
No, I, uh, you know, it might have been my granddaughter.

18:45.940 --> 18:49.340
I think she might put some stuff for sale there, everyone smile.

18:49.340 --> 18:53.860
Hey, uh, Tildy B. Tildy B, come on down here.

18:53.860 --> 18:57.060
Uh, she gets an accident when she yells at her granddaughter.

18:57.420 --> 19:02.340
A teenage girl, uh, comes down the stairs, and as soon as she, uh, sees three police

19:02.340 --> 19:07.300
officers standing in her living room, she bolts back upstairs.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.300
What do you do?

19:08.300 --> 19:10.700
I call, hey Tildy, now, we just want to talk.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.700
I call up the stairs.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.700
You hear a door slam?

19:12.700 --> 19:15.260
This one's on you, boys, I can't go upstairs.

19:15.260 --> 19:18.300
Clark, you go head out the door, I'm gonna make sure she doesn't jump out a window or

19:18.300 --> 19:19.300
something.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.300
Sure.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.460
So John runs around the side of the house and, uh, gets a visual of the windows, and

19:24.460 --> 19:29.180
Clark heads upstairs, uh, you are now facing a door that is shut.

19:29.180 --> 19:33.860
Hey, Tildy, uh, we're, you're not in trouble, we just, we just need to talk to you about

19:33.860 --> 19:38.220
some stuff you might have sold at the, at the booth down at your, your mom's shop down

19:38.220 --> 19:39.220
there.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.180
Uh, you hear, um, some clanking?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.180
Yeah.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.180
Clanking.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.180
You hear some clanking around.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.780
I knock one more time, more forcefully.

19:45.780 --> 19:48.300
Tildy, you gotta open up, or I'm gonna open it up.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.300
No.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.300
No, don't.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.300
Alright, step away from the door.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.700
I kick in the door.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.180
So I'm gonna have the two of you leave.

19:55.180 --> 20:00.260
You're gonna have to take a sanity check.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.260
She's a deer.

20:01.260 --> 20:08.700
She's wearing a three-handed four-hand suit.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.940
Clark, you kick in the door, and a teenage girl is standing before you.

20:12.940 --> 20:18.780
She has a crazed look in her eyes as she slams a large bullet into the chamber and squeezes

20:18.780 --> 20:23.300
the trigger on a really odd-looking revolver.

20:23.300 --> 20:28.540
There's an almost blinding flash of light that illuminates your entire field of vision,

20:28.540 --> 20:34.420
and then, as if she had never been there, the girl is gone.

20:34.420 --> 20:35.420
Roll sanity.

20:35.420 --> 20:36.420
Uh, seven.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.420
I pass.

20:37.420 --> 20:38.420
Okay.

20:38.420 --> 20:41.700
Roll, uh, D6 and a half it for me.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.700
Three and a half.

20:42.700 --> 20:43.700
Two.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.700
Call it a two.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.700
Alright, so Clark loses two sanity.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.220
I am at 52 for the listener at home.

20:48.220 --> 20:59.700
You see this odd gun fall to the floor exactly where this young girl stood, frozen in place.

20:59.700 --> 21:08.260
You're looking at it, and it's this old revolver, and it's got some glass tubing that runs around

21:08.260 --> 21:09.260
the outside of it.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.260
What do you want to do?

21:10.260 --> 21:12.340
Look in the closet, because she had to have just jumped in there.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.020
You creep up to the closet.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.020
Gun drawn.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.740
The door open, and there's nothing inside.

21:17.740 --> 21:20.020
I want to look under that damn bed.

21:20.020 --> 21:21.020
Where'd that girl go?

21:21.020 --> 21:25.920
You look under the bed, and there's no one underneath the bed.

21:25.920 --> 21:30.100
You have absolutely no idea where this girl is gone.

21:30.100 --> 21:34.820
I want to kneel down at the gun, look it over without touching it.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.820
Pretty normal.

21:35.820 --> 21:41.820
It's got, like, a stock, and it's got a barrel, but on the barrel it's almost like a revolver,

21:41.820 --> 21:45.060
but instead of the ... What would that be called?

21:45.060 --> 21:49.620
It's got a very specific name, and I can't remember.

21:49.620 --> 21:52.600
The spinny part ... God, yeah.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.900
If you haven't been able to tell by listening to this podcast, I know lots about guns.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.620
And I know even more.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.500
So instead of that-

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
Oh, God.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
Chamber?

22:03.500 --> 22:04.500
They're chambers.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
Yeah.

22:05.500 --> 22:10.620
So instead of the six chambers, there is one chamber that can be accessed from one side.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.700
It's closed on the other side, and then it's got one chamber.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.500
She slammed a large bullet into ... You saw her do that.

22:16.500 --> 22:21.140
And then it's got those weird metal tubes all around it, and on the back of it, kind

22:21.140 --> 22:27.500
of where the hammer would be, there are two lights, one green, one red, and the red one

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
is currently lit.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.500
I pick it up.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.340
I'm going to look out the window and see what I see out the window.

22:33.340 --> 22:35.580
All right, let's get the other boys back in here.

22:35.580 --> 22:36.580
Yep.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.580
Oh!

22:37.580 --> 22:38.580
Oh!

22:38.580 --> 22:39.580
Oh!

22:39.580 --> 22:40.580
Oh!

22:40.580 --> 22:41.580
Thomas already did that.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.580
Oh, goodness.

22:42.580 --> 22:43.580
Oh.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.580
You okay?

22:44.580 --> 22:48.720
How much sanity did you lose?

22:48.720 --> 22:50.260
Is Tildy alive?

22:50.260 --> 22:53.340
Did she explode into black goo?

22:53.340 --> 22:58.180
Jon, as you ran around the outside of the house, you get to a point to where you could

22:58.180 --> 23:03.800
see the window from where you're assuming her room was, because it's a rather small

23:03.800 --> 23:09.640
two-story house, and you see a extremely bright flash of light come from that room.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.680
I feel like a really dark tingle of recognition and dread.

23:13.680 --> 23:18.440
Keith, you also see a bright flash of light coming from the staircase.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.200
Do I hear anything?

23:20.200 --> 23:22.020
You hear a thud.

23:22.020 --> 23:24.520
I get up out of my wheelchair and start going upstairs.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.520
It's a miracle.

23:25.520 --> 23:29.200
I can still walk.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.440
As Keith is hopping up the stairs, Jon, you see Clark standing in the window.

23:34.440 --> 23:35.660
What does he look like?

23:35.660 --> 23:36.660
He looks horrified.

23:36.660 --> 23:38.200
He's pale white and panicked.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.600
I single to him from below to open up the window.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.860
I go ahead and do that.

23:41.860 --> 23:44.860
What the hell happened?

23:44.860 --> 23:49.680
Uh, you didn't see her.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.680
See who?

23:50.680 --> 23:51.680
Where's Tildy?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.680
She's not here.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.920
Why don't you come on up here?

23:56.920 --> 23:57.920
I come up.

23:58.240 --> 24:01.040
The three of you meet at the platform at the top of the stairs.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.460
What happened?

24:03.460 --> 24:09.920
So I busted in the door, and she shot me.

24:09.920 --> 24:16.200
She pointed a gun at me, and she chambered a bullet, and she shot me, and there was this

24:16.200 --> 24:20.960
blinding white light, and then she wasn't there anymore.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.160
Are you shot?

24:22.160 --> 24:24.520
I don't think so.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
What's the gun look like?

24:25.520 --> 24:26.520
Be cautious, Leag.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.520
Go look at the gun.

24:28.120 --> 24:34.480
The gun looks like an old-timey revolver, but where the chamber is, six bullets, maybe

24:34.480 --> 24:35.480
you know.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.480
Do you know what that thing's called?

24:36.480 --> 24:37.480
Cylinder.

24:37.480 --> 24:38.480
Cylinder!

24:38.480 --> 24:39.480
That's the name!

24:39.480 --> 24:40.480
We could not come up with it.

24:40.480 --> 24:45.160
So where the cylinder was, there's basically, on one side, it's completely enclosed, cased

24:45.160 --> 24:50.040
in, and on the other side, there's a small sliding door, basically, that you can slide

24:50.040 --> 24:55.680
open and shut, and it would fit one bullet that's the size of a cylinder.

24:55.680 --> 25:02.060
And then there are glass tubes, one going underneath it, and then one kind of going

25:02.060 --> 25:07.660
around the side where it's closed, and then on the back of the gun where the hammer is,

25:07.660 --> 25:11.560
there are two lights, one red, one green, and the red one is lit.

25:11.560 --> 25:14.000
John, it's like that goddamn camera you found.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
How do you mean?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.120
It's got glass tubing and lights.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.400
I don't really see it.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.400
I shake him.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.400
Don't fuck with me, man!

25:21.400 --> 25:22.400
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.720
You're, it's, of course.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.360
I want to look around the rest of the room.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.360
She's not in the closet.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.360
I checked there.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.360
I mean, you saw her run in the room.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.840
Well, I want to see if anything else like that is in here.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.600
You sure she was in here when you opened that door?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.360
She was frightened as all get out.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.360
She was scared.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.360
We looked each other in the eye.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.160
What did the bullet look like that she chambered?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.720
I was going to ask that as Joe.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.780
Did I see her chamber the bullet itself, and did I see what light, if there were lights

25:42.780 --> 25:44.720
on the gun at the time that she shot?

25:44.720 --> 25:47.900
The lights would have been facing her, so you wouldn't have seen that.

25:47.900 --> 25:53.160
You did see her slam a, what looked like a large bullet casing.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
Did he see the tubes?

25:54.160 --> 25:55.160
Oh yeah, they were there.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.340
Let's see where she got the bullet from.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.840
She already had it in hand when he kicked in the door.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.400
Okay, we heard her fumbling around.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.840
As soon as he kicked in the door, she slammed that bullet into place and shot.

26:03.840 --> 26:04.840
Okay.

26:04.840 --> 26:05.840
It was a big ass bullet.

26:05.840 --> 26:06.840
Where'd it go?

26:06.840 --> 26:07.840
Where'd she go?

26:07.840 --> 26:11.200
Well, let's, let's look around the room and see if we find anything else similar to the

26:11.200 --> 26:12.200
camera or the gun.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.200
Clark points under the bed.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.480
I checked there and he points at the closet.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.480
I checked, I checked there.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.800
I don't know where else, unless you jumped out the window, but you were out there.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.120
Did you check under the bed?

26:21.120 --> 26:22.120
That's, yeah, that's what I meant.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
I checked under the bed.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
Did you check in the bed?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
Nope.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.240
I checked in the bed.

26:28.240 --> 26:35.380
Pulling back the covers.

26:35.380 --> 26:39.100
There's an elaborate like fake sleeping doll that she had made to sneak out of the house

26:39.100 --> 26:40.100
later than me.

26:40.100 --> 26:44.760
Ferris Bueller asks, three pillows outside of contention Missouri.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.760
Boo.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
Yeah, that was bad.

26:47.760 --> 26:52.800
I want to start looking around in some drawers and stuff.

26:52.800 --> 26:53.800
Oh yeah.

26:53.800 --> 26:54.800
Yeah.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
Let's toss this place.

26:56.480 --> 26:57.800
I think Clark is sitting on the edge of the bed.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.660
I think we're all okay with that.

27:00.660 --> 27:06.960
It's really just a completely normal teenager's room, but inside her sock drawer is a wad

27:06.960 --> 27:08.840
of $20 bills all rolled up.

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
I take it.

27:09.840 --> 27:14.400
A drug dealer's wad, like more of a wad than a teenager should have or like the kind of

27:14.400 --> 27:17.320
scrap you might get like selling bullshit at a flea park.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
Yeah, exactly.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.320
Like 200 bucks.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.040
So like the meanest definition of wad.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.040
Oh yeah.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.040
Yeah.

27:24.280 --> 27:29.360
Also, oh my God, like if I was fucking 15 right now and had a wad of 200 bucks, I would

27:29.360 --> 27:30.360
feel like a clean.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.360
A what?

27:31.360 --> 27:38.080
Also, just like right now at 28, I would really love to have $200 in my pocket.

27:38.080 --> 27:41.360
When the gun went off and there was the flash of light, was there a sound?

27:41.360 --> 27:42.360
No.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.360
Okay.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.120
I want to hop back downstairs and let Mildred know.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.160
We all came here together, but did we take separate cars?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.680
I want to know where the camera is basically.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.200
I want to take a picture of this room with the camera and I want to see if her shooting

27:53.200 --> 27:54.400
anything is like reactive.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.240
I want to see if it's the green lights on again.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.240
Okay.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.040
So if I have to go back to the station or whatever and get it.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.080
It can be in your cruiser outside.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.440
You probably took two cruisers here because Keith is probably not driving.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.440
Nope.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.440
So has anything changed with the camera?

28:06.440 --> 28:07.440
Is the green light back on?

28:07.440 --> 28:08.440
No, it's red.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.600
I want to take it into the room.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.440
So you rush out the front door.

28:12.440 --> 28:18.880
Keith and Clark, you guys come back downstairs and Mildred is sitting on her couch in a Snuggie

28:18.880 --> 28:22.300
drinking some tea, watching TV.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.540
As I run by, I'm like, Hey Mildred, has Tildy ever disappeared in a flash of light before?

28:25.540 --> 28:26.540
I'll be right back.

28:26.540 --> 28:27.540
But think on that.

28:27.540 --> 28:30.940
She kind of looks up at the two of you as you come down the stairs.

28:30.940 --> 28:35.540
As John comes running back inside, she's like super blazed in her eyes.

28:35.540 --> 28:39.020
Hey Tildy, honestly, for somebody who smokes weed all the time, it seems like you cannot

28:39.020 --> 28:40.740
handle your shit.

28:40.740 --> 28:42.260
Just in as I'm running back to Tildy's room.

28:42.260 --> 28:44.460
Anyway, you smoke some weak ass grass.

28:44.460 --> 28:45.700
Hey Mildred.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.700
Hey.

28:46.700 --> 28:49.340
You got any of that peppermint tea still?

28:49.340 --> 28:50.340
It's sitting right here for you.

28:50.380 --> 28:54.380
I go over and I'm just sitting at the kitchen table or whatever it is, head in hand, drinking

28:54.380 --> 28:55.380
it.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.380
Did you know that she had a gun?

28:56.380 --> 28:57.380
She?

28:57.380 --> 28:58.380
She had a what?

28:58.380 --> 29:02.500
She had a gun and also she's not here anymore.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.180
What do you mean she's not here anymore?

29:04.180 --> 29:08.940
We don't know where she is, but she ain't here.

29:08.940 --> 29:10.380
Wasn't she upstairs?

29:10.380 --> 29:12.380
He knows more about it than we do.

29:12.380 --> 29:18.340
Tildy B. Tildy B.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.620
I'm upstairs in her room.

29:19.620 --> 29:22.060
I'm just like, no, she disappeared in light.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.060
We told you.

29:48.340 --> 29:49.340
Never know.

29:49.340 --> 29:50.340
Drowning out.

29:50.340 --> 29:51.340
All I know.

29:51.340 --> 29:52.340
There's nobody home.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.340
Nobody home.

29:53.340 --> 29:54.340
There's nobody home.

29:54.340 --> 29:55.340
Fight, fight.

29:55.340 --> 29:56.340
Street me down.

29:56.340 --> 29:57.340
Takes me back.

29:57.340 --> 29:58.340
To where you're from.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.340
Don't stop.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.340
Don't stop.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.340
Don't stop.

30:01.340 --> 30:02.340
Don't stop.

30:02.340 --> 30:03.340
Don't stop.

30:03.340 --> 30:03.340


30:18.340 --> 30:46.340
Don't stop.

30:46.340 --> 31:15.340
Don't give up.

31:16.340 --> 31:31.340
Don't give up.

31:31.340 --> 32:00.340
Don't give up.

32:01.340 --> 32:10.340
Don't give up.
