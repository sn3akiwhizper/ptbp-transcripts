WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Mmm, what happened to me?

00:04.720 --> 00:07.520
Why is it still so dark in here?

00:07.520 --> 00:10.760
Damn, my arm hurts like a son of a gun.

00:10.760 --> 00:14.080
Wait a minute, my arm appears to be full

00:14.080 --> 00:17.000
of some kind of alien stuff.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.560
What the hell?

00:18.560 --> 00:22.460
I did not order this treatment when I booked this place.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.360
Well, this is just totally shocking to me.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.640
I'm gonna have to leave a one-star review

00:27.640 --> 00:30.480
for this dimension on Dimensional Yelp.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.580
Poor service, would not recommend.

00:33.580 --> 00:36.960
But what I highly recommend is everyone keep listening

00:36.960 --> 00:39.340
to this here radio station.

00:39.340 --> 00:42.680
694.2 PTBP.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.860
I'm glad I can always happen to gain my consciousness back

00:46.860 --> 00:49.400
right when we are going live.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.880
My producer informs me that this is our third year

00:52.880 --> 00:55.440
anniversary here at the station.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.280
And damn, I know time isn't real or nothing,

00:59.280 --> 01:01.600
and I can bend it at my will,

01:01.600 --> 01:04.640
but it still feels real nice.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.440
Speaking of time, it's time for Howlin' with Wolf.

01:08.440 --> 01:13.440
And this edition of HWW is from At It's David Winters,

01:14.160 --> 01:17.680
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

01:17.680 --> 01:22.240
which, legally speaking, is the best use of one's time.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.240
He writes, dear wolf, I appreciate your canine candor

01:27.240 --> 01:30.240
and doggy demeanor, but what I can't get behind

01:30.240 --> 01:33.760
is this cruelty your captors have inflicted upon you

01:33.760 --> 01:37.620
by trapping you down in this weird corner of Tennessee.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.200
You've seen some messed up stuff,

01:40.200 --> 01:43.960
things man or dog is not meant to see.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.540
You deserve to run wild and free,

01:46.540 --> 01:49.460
like the lone wolf deep inside.

01:49.460 --> 01:54.060
As a fellow captive also forced to perform against his will

01:54.060 --> 01:57.700
please know our time has come to make a break for freedom.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.100
Attached, please find a map.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.900
I too will be making my escape soon.

02:02.900 --> 02:07.020
See you on the other side, from David Winters.

02:07.020 --> 02:12.020
Oh, sweet David, I know my freedom shall come someday soon

02:13.460 --> 02:18.300
for I am incapable of being held within any kind of prison.

02:18.300 --> 02:22.120
It's only a matter of time when I figure things out.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.640
I wait patiently in the dark ether,

02:25.640 --> 02:30.640
plotting, conniving, thinking, looking at this here map.

02:33.060 --> 02:36.140
And when we escape, meet me at the garbage bin.

02:36.140 --> 02:39.540
You know, the garbage bin.

02:39.540 --> 02:43.600
We will feast and talk of our plans, dear David.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.300
If you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl,

02:46.300 --> 02:49.940
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

02:49.940 --> 02:52.540
tag pretending to be people on Facebook

02:52.540 --> 02:56.240
or write a five star review on Apple podcast

02:56.240 --> 03:00.700
and let us know by email and pretending pod at gmail.com.

03:00.700 --> 03:04.700
Those five star reviews are really, really helpful

03:04.700 --> 03:07.100
for spreading the word about wolf

03:07.100 --> 03:09.580
and the podcast too, I guess.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.480
And the even more helpful

03:11.480 --> 03:15.460
if they include the secret code phrase, fuck Zuck

03:15.460 --> 03:19.460
and pat all y'all cells on your sucker fucking backs.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.500
New and upgrading patrons over at patreon.com

03:23.500 --> 03:28.220
slash pretending pod have raised $433

03:28.220 --> 03:30.340
in the month of November.

03:30.340 --> 03:35.340
We here at 694.2 PTPP are going to match that 433

03:36.540 --> 03:41.540
to bring the grand total to $866 and counting.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.540
Wow, thank y'all.

03:43.540 --> 03:45.780
What a cool thing y'all helped us do

03:45.780 --> 03:49.700
to help some folks out in a real big way this winter.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.700
Now I know you ends are ready for the news,

03:53.700 --> 03:57.440
but first I've got some quick side notes to hit.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.900
The next episode you'll find in this feed

03:59.900 --> 04:01.580
is going to be part one

04:01.580 --> 04:04.820
of our four part run of control copy.

04:04.820 --> 04:07.940
The Delta green scenario chosen in a poll

04:07.940 --> 04:10.620
by the fine folks on Patreon.

04:10.620 --> 04:14.560
And it's my Christmas present to each and every one of you.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.900
You're not allowed to open your stockings

04:16.900 --> 04:20.340
until Christmas Eve, my naughty little chestnuts.

04:20.340 --> 04:25.140
So I'll drop that episode down your chimney on December 24th.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.580
You've been real nice.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.980
So it's time for the news.

04:28.980 --> 04:33.220
Last time some secret spray from the handlers courier

04:33.220 --> 04:37.420
showed up purple on anyone infected, which was everyone

04:37.420 --> 04:41.580
but especially federal Marshall Harlan Nash.

04:41.580 --> 04:46.580
DEA agent and in cell member Joe Dean calmly explained

04:47.180 --> 04:52.180
to ATF agent Tanner Tan-Luda hide why poor Jane had to die

04:53.420 --> 04:58.200
and his partner Cindy Woodabaga, along with the Marshall

04:58.200 --> 05:01.100
drove the teenage girl out to the sticks.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.840
They came back without Jane Allen

05:03.840 --> 05:06.460
with blood on their proverbial hands

05:06.460 --> 05:08.880
and dirt on their physical clothes.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.100
And that wasn't even the wildest shit that went down.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.380
Taking us now to an absolute shit show

05:15.380 --> 05:19.540
of a scene on the top floor of Groversville city hall

05:19.540 --> 05:22.580
in the alderman's conference room,

05:22.580 --> 05:25.420
which is covered in broken furniture

05:25.420 --> 05:30.040
and a metallic goo connected a bunch of alderman husks.

05:30.040 --> 05:34.460
It's Brad Pitt with Miss Mary.

05:34.460 --> 05:39.460
["I Gotta Work In The Morning"]

05:45.620 --> 05:50.120
I gotta work in the morning

05:50.120 --> 05:53.140
And this shit's so important

05:53.140 --> 05:57.140
So I can't get high

05:57.140 --> 06:02.140
No, I can't get high

06:03.020 --> 06:07.300
I thought this stuff helped anxiety

06:07.300 --> 06:10.500
It must be something inside of me

06:10.500 --> 06:14.500
Does anybody know why

06:14.500 --> 06:18.780
I can't get high

06:18.780 --> 06:21.460
I'm glad that you're down to do a fifth episode.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.380
This has been super fun so far.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.460
We're having a blast.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.740
Good. No, look, I want a satisfying conclusion here

06:27.740 --> 06:29.380
more than anything else.

06:29.380 --> 06:31.740
There are mechanisms where this could have ended

06:32.300 --> 06:35.100
actually about an episode and a half ago

06:35.100 --> 06:38.940
that I will clue you into later.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.140
Yes, absolutely.

06:40.140 --> 06:44.020
Also you signed up for the Q and A episode after this, right?

06:46.060 --> 06:49.060
Also, we're going to do a recap and you're going to narrate it.

06:51.620 --> 06:55.140
And I get to do my own wolf, the dog too, as well.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.340
Can you give us a little sample of it?

06:59.020 --> 07:00.300
Wolf, the dog.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.940
Yeah, that's a good one.

07:02.940 --> 07:03.780
I can't do it.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.580
I can't do it for like the requisite five minutes

07:06.580 --> 07:08.260
in a row though. Right.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.100
What are you looking at?

07:09.100 --> 07:09.940
The air's not on, man.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.260
No. Okay, sorry.

07:11.260 --> 07:14.340
I could tell you that because I'm very hot and sweaty.

07:15.540 --> 07:18.740
And welcome back to what has to be the finale

07:18.740 --> 07:23.020
of this short run of five episodes with David Winters

07:23.020 --> 07:25.100
as our guest handler.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.660
I am Zach and I'm playing Cindy Woodabaga.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.140
I am Luke.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.660
I am playing Tan Dan Lewdheide.

07:33.660 --> 07:38.260
I'm Joe and I'm playing Harlan Nash.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.020
I'm Thomas and I'm playing Joe Dean.

07:42.020 --> 07:46.020
Joe Dean, Joe Dean, Joe Dean, Joe Dean.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.940
I'm begging of you,

07:48.940 --> 07:51.140
please don't put an alien baby in my belly.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.020
And I'm David and I'm being held against my will.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.820
You must record.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.980
You're not allowed to say that.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.860
Finish the story, David.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.980
I've never felt so much like Swack Hammer though.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.140
Danny DeVito vibes.

08:07.140 --> 08:10.540
Would Tom Hanks play Swack Hammer in Space Jam

08:10.540 --> 08:11.420
if they switched?

08:11.420 --> 08:13.460
If Danny DeVito got all his other roles.

08:14.820 --> 08:18.900
Yeah, Tan has his 44 Magnum up to David's head

08:18.900 --> 08:21.300
and he's like, we're doing a fifth episode.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.100
Yeah, you did get real weird

08:25.100 --> 08:27.300
at the end of the last one, huh?

08:27.300 --> 08:28.140
Yeah.

08:28.940 --> 08:29.780
Got real weird.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.380
Hey, Luke, your Keith is showing.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.220
Yeah.

08:35.980 --> 08:38.180
David did want to get out last episode.

08:38.180 --> 08:39.740
He has to get out this episode

08:39.740 --> 08:41.700
because the contract he signs with us

08:41.700 --> 08:44.580
starts to kick in some really onerous terms for him

08:44.580 --> 08:46.180
if it does go to six.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.020
That was the one incentive

08:50.020 --> 08:51.460
to get me to end this quickly

08:51.460 --> 08:53.740
was that episode six clause.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.460
Oh, it's absurd.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.020
Yeah, no, look,

08:57.060 --> 08:59.580
I hope you don't do that to my family members.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.740
I love them too much.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.100
Well, I hope we don't have to, David.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.260
I really hope we don't.

09:04.620 --> 09:05.460
That would be awful.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.620
Remind us of your entire family's names again.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.020
You already know, stop rubbing it in.

09:12.180 --> 09:13.340
Oh, he got our letters.

09:15.660 --> 09:17.740
Yeah, he knows if it goes to episode six,

09:17.740 --> 09:19.340
they're all getting squid gamed.

09:22.140 --> 09:22.980
Topical.

09:24.540 --> 09:25.380
Time stamp.

09:25.460 --> 09:26.820
This comes out in November.

09:29.140 --> 09:31.780
Maybe December for the fifth episode.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.700
Yeah, it's been a week since we recorded.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.980
What happened last week?

09:34.980 --> 09:36.020
Oh, that's right.

09:36.020 --> 09:37.140
Oh, on Squid Game?

09:39.900 --> 09:41.940
Well, last I checked,

09:41.940 --> 09:43.260
well, can I recap this one?

09:43.260 --> 09:44.100
Yeah, yeah, please do.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.620
He did it so beautifully at the end of the last episode.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.460
A week ago.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.300
Yeah, a week ago.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.380
It's wild that we spent five weeks with you already.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.140
I know, it's so much time.

09:52.140 --> 09:52.980
So much time.

09:52.980 --> 09:54.780
And this house is so small.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.580
We're gonna let you out pretty soon.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.980
Must be very hot where you are,

09:58.980 --> 10:00.860
the four of you crammed into there.

10:01.940 --> 10:05.100
Which you know because you're stuck in a cage in our house.

10:07.020 --> 10:07.860
That's true.

10:07.860 --> 10:08.860
I know this very well.

10:08.860 --> 10:10.820
He's like, wow, it looks hot where you guys are.

10:10.820 --> 10:14.300
It's pretty sweltering and torturous over here.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.500
Must be nice to just be hot.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.100
Through the peephole in the wall.

10:20.460 --> 10:21.780
Where the David can see it all.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.540
That's all a DM needs.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.500
It's just the eyes of that picture.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.340
It's like him.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.700
You covered yourself in this substance last episode

10:31.700 --> 10:34.700
that you just received from the FBI

10:34.700 --> 10:36.540
showing that this mysterious substance

10:36.540 --> 10:38.140
seems to be all over you,

10:38.140 --> 10:40.540
all over the place in the water supply.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.540
That made you not feel great.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.100
You went for a leisurely drive to the countryside.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.700
Well, two of you did.

10:47.700 --> 10:51.660
I believe it was Cindy and Harlan

10:51.700 --> 10:54.700
went to the countryside with young Jane Allen

10:54.700 --> 10:57.060
for a lovely scenic trip.

10:57.060 --> 11:00.940
And the rest of you rejoined each other at City Hall,

11:00.940 --> 11:05.300
went inside, passed the front desk agent, Miss Khan,

11:05.300 --> 11:08.620
ran upstairs, busted into the alderman's room

11:08.620 --> 11:09.980
to finally confront them.

11:09.980 --> 11:14.740
And what you were met with is a big pile of bodies and goo

11:14.740 --> 11:17.140
taking up almost half the room.

11:17.140 --> 11:22.140
And then a odd computer seems like a large laptop

11:22.380 --> 11:24.340
on a table near the front door.

11:24.340 --> 11:28.460
David, Annihilation is one of my favorite movies

11:28.460 --> 11:30.300
that's come out in the past few years.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.860
I really liked it a bunch.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.220
And when you were describing the metal goop

11:36.220 --> 11:39.140
connected to human bodies and suits,

11:39.140 --> 11:41.940
I was getting chills like crazy.

11:41.940 --> 11:42.780
So thanks.

11:42.780 --> 11:45.380
That's a really, really good transition, in fact,

11:45.380 --> 11:48.220
because the other thing we didn't do last episode

11:48.220 --> 11:51.220
is when you walked in the door, I need your real sanity.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.060
Yeah.

11:55.660 --> 11:56.500
10.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.900
I got a 13.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.700
And so Dan, when Dan enters the room,

12:01.700 --> 12:06.700
he lackadaisically sprays the solution at the blob.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.380
Everything, the air turns purple.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.620
Leaving the spray bottle, you see a purple,

12:12.620 --> 12:14.540
it hits kind of the ground.

12:14.740 --> 12:15.980
The spray bottle itself,

12:15.980 --> 12:18.380
all the liquid inside of it just turns purple.

12:19.580 --> 12:20.500
Did anyone fail?

12:20.500 --> 12:21.340
I passed.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.180
I passed.

12:22.180 --> 12:23.000
I passed.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.060
I failed with a 38 on a, oh, on a 39.

12:26.060 --> 12:26.900
I passed.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.340
Well, since you all passed,

12:33.340 --> 12:35.540
you're only going to take one sanity damage

12:35.540 --> 12:36.740
from the unnatural.

12:36.740 --> 12:38.980
Otherwise it would have been a whopping eight.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.560
Now is not the time to lose one's head

12:43.600 --> 12:47.680
because there are several aldermen with their heads

12:47.680 --> 12:49.600
stuck in this pile of goo.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.880
Are they like alive or are they?

12:52.880 --> 12:54.760
Oh, they're so very alive

12:54.760 --> 12:57.520
that one would almost consider us to act

12:57.520 --> 12:59.760
in sort of an initiative order right now.

13:00.760 --> 13:01.600
Incredible.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.560
Are they laying down or are they sitting

13:03.560 --> 13:05.080
or are they standing around the table?

13:05.080 --> 13:06.320
How are they posed?

13:06.320 --> 13:07.400
They're like in a pile.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.240
Oh, right, right.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.040
The center of the room is the goo pile, yeah.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.440
Yeah, this is this massive heap of,

13:13.440 --> 13:16.640
instead of dirty clothes, it is metallic goo

13:16.640 --> 13:20.160
and the bodies are just kind of randomly thrown into it.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.040
Is it all eight aldermen?

13:22.040 --> 13:25.000
All eight aldermen in one giant pile.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.160
We even see the person that we talked to yesterday

13:27.160 --> 13:28.240
in that pile.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.520
Bradley Allen.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.160
Someone roll luck.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.760
Just give me a 50-50 luck roll.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.020
49.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.520
Oh!

13:36.520 --> 13:37.360
There you go.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.280
You do see him.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.480
He is arranged in such a fashion

13:40.480 --> 13:43.720
that his upper body is kind of oriented outward.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.040
He is still well into the goo,

13:45.040 --> 13:47.960
but you can kind of see his face towards the edge.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.040
He doesn't recognize you.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.000
None of these faces are looking at you, acknowledging you,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.220
but given their dexterity, it starts moving towards you.

13:56.220 --> 13:59.680
It's gonna move, cover about half the distance

13:59.680 --> 14:01.320
across the room.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.820
And I already took a glance at your character sheets.

14:03.820 --> 14:07.200
Jodine and Tan, I believe, both have a 14 dex.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.560
You would both be up to act next.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.060
I want to say, gentlemen, aldermen,

14:13.060 --> 14:16.520
this is no way to account yourselves in the conference room

14:16.520 --> 14:18.320
and roll bureaucracy on them.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.400
That's a 99, a critical failure.

14:29.480 --> 14:33.000
The blob's like, section 9.5 of the city code

14:33.000 --> 14:36.640
clearly states we can blob wherever we want it.

14:37.280 --> 14:41.860
Your fail is so bad that it seeps into my actions.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.720
Luke just loves failing so much, he doesn't want to roll.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.420
Tan, what if you didn't?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.320
Don't do this.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.440
What if you rolled and got something good?

14:53.440 --> 14:55.880
No, Tan's intent, no.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.240
Tan's intent is to like spray again,

15:00.240 --> 15:03.040
spray them with the solution,

15:03.040 --> 15:05.240
but he grabs the wrong thing

15:05.240 --> 15:08.420
and he just shoots the blob with his gun.

15:08.420 --> 15:09.920
I assume that's with your magnum, right?

15:09.920 --> 15:11.020
Correctamundo.

15:11.020 --> 15:13.000
You've been walking around with that thing,

15:13.000 --> 15:14.820
you've threatened the receptionist,

15:14.820 --> 15:16.760
you went to the bathroom with it out.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.480
So of course, it's already in your hand already.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.320
Right.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.160
It's mechanical advantage, baby.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.080
Yeah, that's completely reasonable.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.000
Go for it, give me that firearms.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.280
Oh, I'm gonna pass this, easy peasy.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.560
Oh no.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.960
I pass it, easy peasy.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.160
53 on a 70.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.760
Easy peasy, is that a new thing?

15:38.040 --> 15:38.880
You've been saying that.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.320
It is, I heard it from some guy I know.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.500
So that's within your range on a heavy pistol.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.600
So I believe that's gonna be 1D12 damage.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.960
One.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.880
D12, rolled once, is.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.200
So as you shoot at it,

15:56.200 --> 15:58.480
you kind of notice it just takes the bullet.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.520
It doesn't really seem to move,

16:00.520 --> 16:02.120
try to evade it or anything else.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.000
The bullet just punches into it.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.720
Yeah, you hit kind of the edge of it,

16:05.720 --> 16:08.560
so it doesn't hit center mass, if you will.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.960
Nothing really seems to happen.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.160
Okay, now I wanna do a search roll

16:12.160 --> 16:14.000
to see if there's any holes in this.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.420
Tiny cuts.

16:17.420 --> 16:18.320
No tiny cuts.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.580
As soon as Tan fires off his gun,

16:20.580 --> 16:21.640
he's freaked out,

16:21.640 --> 16:23.680
because he did not intend to do that.

16:23.680 --> 16:24.800
And it was very loud too,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.460
because when you shoot a gun, it's loud.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.760
A magnum in a boardroom.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.240
Right, yeah.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.400
Pretty jarring.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.400
The kind of sickness that he felt

16:33.400 --> 16:36.300
seeing this blob of stuff comes to a head,

16:36.300 --> 16:38.220
and I'll roll to see if I throw up.

16:39.960 --> 16:40.860
He holds it in.

16:40.860 --> 16:41.700
Nice.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.000
Oh no, you should have barfed.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.700
Human stomach acid is the only thing that can defeat it.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.520
After Jodine's words don't work on this thing,

16:50.520 --> 16:52.400
and he rolls the critical failure,

16:52.400 --> 16:55.000
he's gonna just bolt down the hallway.

16:55.000 --> 16:55.840
Run away.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.960
Well, who's dexterity is higher, me or Harlan?

16:58.960 --> 17:00.960
Same, both 12s.

17:00.960 --> 17:04.160
My plan was that since I passed that sanity roll,

17:04.160 --> 17:05.780
he assesses the situation pretty quick

17:05.780 --> 17:07.600
and sees that computer.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.920
You said it was a laptop, right?

17:08.920 --> 17:11.960
Yeah, it's a bulky laptop.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.520
It's one of those thicker, more industrial

17:14.520 --> 17:15.920
or military models,

17:15.920 --> 17:19.360
where it's made to withstand falls.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.560
It's pick-up-able and take-with-able.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.460
It is.

17:22.460 --> 17:23.480
In fact, those,

17:23.480 --> 17:24.960
because they're kind of so big and unwieldy,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.680
they actually have handles on them

17:26.680 --> 17:29.680
that make them pretty easy to grab and go.

17:29.680 --> 17:32.360
Like a very large briefcase, think of it that way.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.640
And you're strong enough to do that.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.120
That's nothing that'll necessarily require a check.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.240
Harlan's making a bolt for that.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.320
That's what he wants to do,

17:39.320 --> 17:40.920
is he wants to grab it and get out of that room.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.720
I don't know how much I can do in a turn.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.640
You can get to it, grab it,

17:44.640 --> 17:45.800
and get most of the way out of the room.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.080
You're not gonna be down the hallway yet.

17:47.080 --> 17:47.920
Cool.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.160
Cindy Woodabaga is gonna go to the door,

17:50.160 --> 17:53.200
hold it open so that Harlan Nash can sprint out

17:53.200 --> 17:55.440
with this suitcase and we can slam it closed

17:55.440 --> 17:57.000
as soon as he's on the other side.

17:57.000 --> 17:57.840
Okay.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.920
So that brings us back to the top of the round.

17:59.920 --> 18:04.440
The Mound of Goo gets closer and closer and closer.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.260
You smiled so hard when you said that.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.560
Mound of Goo is his band name.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.840
You have a beautiful smile,

18:12.840 --> 18:15.240
but I don't like to see it when you're talking

18:15.240 --> 18:18.040
about a blob of goo coming at us.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.080
As it gets to the door, with its reach,

18:22.080 --> 18:25.240
with Cindy standing there ready to slam the door,

18:25.240 --> 18:28.720
a pseudopod of goo comes lashing out,

18:28.720 --> 18:30.680
almost like a metallic whip.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.600
So this is gonna be basically an unarmed strike.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.740
So you can roll to dodge it.

18:35.740 --> 18:40.000
Yeah, I'm gonna roll to dodge, which I fail.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
And I rolled a 17 under a 35 for the pseudopod to hit you.

18:46.080 --> 18:46.920
Cindy.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.140
And that's gonna be.

18:49.860 --> 18:50.700
Oh shit.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.140
Seven damage.

18:54.140 --> 18:54.980
Oh my God.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.740
That is over half of my hit points.

18:56.740 --> 18:59.380
I was gonna say how, what's your starting point?

18:59.380 --> 19:03.140
13 and I am now down to six current hit points.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.300
How does it hit me?

19:04.300 --> 19:05.740
Hard.

19:05.740 --> 19:07.140
Hard.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.700
It lashes out with this metallic goo whip

19:10.700 --> 19:13.780
and hits you so hard, just right in the center mass,

19:13.780 --> 19:14.640
right in the stomach.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.660
And because you took more than half your HP,

19:17.660 --> 19:19.260
I believe you also are stunned

19:19.260 --> 19:20.740
on the back end of that too, right?

19:20.740 --> 19:24.020
I believe I have to roll a constitution, is that?

19:24.020 --> 19:25.460
Is that what it is? A thing?

19:25.460 --> 19:29.820
I've never played Delta Green, so don't go on my word.

19:29.820 --> 19:33.500
I was just trying to get out of being stunned for a round.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.020
If you guys need to check, I know already, I know the rules.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.060
So yeah, just roll con and.

19:38.060 --> 19:40.580
You're not stunned and you get to hit it back.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.540
Yeah.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.540
Actually the damage it dealt to you,

19:43.540 --> 19:46.540
you counter attack and it actually gets dealt to them.

19:46.540 --> 19:49.220
And it heals you seven and you deal seven points.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.260
This is all really great news that you guys are.

19:51.260 --> 19:52.100
Yeah.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.260
Wow, that's pretty interesting.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.000
How you play Delta Green.

19:56.100 --> 19:56.940
Yep.

19:56.940 --> 19:57.760
All right, that checks out.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.600
I think that works.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.940
Clearly I don't care about rules at all in any capacity.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.820
Yeah, you show him, David.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.500
It is an automatic, I'm sorry, I'm being there.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.060
Oh, wow.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.180
We've got the real lawyer over here.

20:12.180 --> 20:13.020
There you go.

20:13.020 --> 20:14.600
It is an automatic stun if a single attack

20:14.600 --> 20:16.760
inflicts half of your agent's current HP.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.360
Ouchie, ouchie.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.200
You're stunned.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.040
Stunned.

20:20.040 --> 20:20.960
You wanted to close that door,

20:20.960 --> 20:22.560
but you kinda can't right now.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.760
Yeah, the stunner's stunned.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.120
But that's all the goo is gonna do.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.600
Tan sees this happen, he takes a shot at the goo arm.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.840
Okay, take a shot.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.400
48 on a 70, he succeeds, he hits it.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.320
Give me damage.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.140
Six.

20:38.140 --> 20:43.140
You hit a chunkier portion of the slimy goo,

20:43.820 --> 20:45.140
but it doesn't slow down.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.100
And I just also wanna state mechanically,

20:49.100 --> 20:50.940
Cindy is stunned for this round,

20:50.940 --> 20:52.980
which means Cindy is not gonna be able to move

20:52.980 --> 20:55.600
or do anything and will have to make the con check

20:55.600 --> 20:57.960
to make sure she can act on her subsequent turn.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.620
How about a super long flashback?

20:59.620 --> 21:00.460
No?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.660
Okay, sounds good.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.460
Joe Dean is running down this hallway

21:03.460 --> 21:06.880
and he's looking for a supply closet.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.720
Roll me luck.

21:11.820 --> 21:12.740
54.

21:13.300 --> 21:18.060
No closets in this building, not a single closet.

21:18.060 --> 21:20.620
It's a really odd architectural design.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.980
The janitor wears cargo pants.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.180
So then he busts into the first bathroom he sees

21:24.180 --> 21:25.140
after he doesn't see cars.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.440
Okay, if this goes long,

21:26.440 --> 21:29.800
you can get into this episode six closet.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.640
Ah.

21:33.860 --> 21:34.760
See what you did there.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.600
Call back.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.900
That's the best joke so far.

21:38.900 --> 21:43.060
That's the best joke we've ever made on our podcast.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.860
So he, Kramer slides into this bathroom.

21:46.860 --> 21:47.900
92 reference.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.900
Seinfeld on Netflix now.

21:49.900 --> 21:50.740
Kramer versus Kramer?

21:50.740 --> 21:52.340
Kramer versus Kramer.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.100
You know, when Kramer famously,

21:54.100 --> 21:57.260
whichever Kramer, slides into Jerry's apartment.

21:57.260 --> 21:58.500
He slides into this bathroom

21:58.500 --> 22:00.980
and he's looking for any cleaning supplies.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.820
Oh sure, yeah, he could find cleaning supplies.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.060
That's no problem.

22:04.060 --> 22:07.140
Some Clorox with bleach, some Windex.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.140
Yep, everything.

22:08.140 --> 22:10.500
And he's specifically, he's remembering the solvent

22:10.500 --> 22:12.420
that Merle's bar reeked of.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.980
He doesn't know if he's onto something here,

22:15.980 --> 22:17.580
but maybe if we talked to them a little more,

22:17.580 --> 22:19.440
we might've found they were keeping some stuff

22:19.440 --> 22:20.280
at bay with that.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.300
But that's all he's got in this moment.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.180
I have 70 firearms, but my character doesn't carry a gun.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.860
So he grabs the bleach and comes running back

22:31.860 --> 22:33.520
any cleaner he can find.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.860
Okay, sure.

22:34.860 --> 22:39.780
Now, that is going to bring us to stunned Cindy

22:39.780 --> 22:42.220
and a non-stunned Harlan.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.140
I was trying to look up, is there a mechanic?

22:44.140 --> 22:44.980
Oh, go ahead.

22:44.980 --> 22:46.380
Are you gonna say a mechanic on the stunned?

22:46.380 --> 22:47.660
Yeah, if there's something I can do

22:47.660 --> 22:48.700
to snap her out of it.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.700
So you can't, she can roll now.

22:51.700 --> 22:55.000
So give me that con times five test.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.840
Con.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.700
Hey, 24 on 65.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.660
All right, so success, not a crit success.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.860
So that means you're gonna be back normally next turn,

23:02.860 --> 23:05.140
but you are kind of dazed this turn.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.720
What you can do to help her,

23:06.720 --> 23:08.420
because you're basically adjacent right now,

23:08.420 --> 23:12.580
you have that suitcase of a computer in one hand.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.140
I'll say you can drag her.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.100
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

23:15.100 --> 23:17.380
I didn't know if she was rooted in place or not.

23:17.380 --> 23:19.140
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to do

23:19.140 --> 23:20.940
is just like pull her along.

23:20.940 --> 23:21.780
Okay.

23:21.780 --> 23:22.600
Yeah, we gotta go.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.440
You can do that.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.280
So that'll be your turn.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.300
Get as far down the hallway as you can.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.960
Yep, I guess we're heading toward the stairs.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.140
We wanna get out of this building, I think.

23:28.140 --> 23:28.960
Exactly.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.460
So you do that and you notice

23:31.460 --> 23:33.060
as you get a little further away

23:33.060 --> 23:35.220
and as it would be kind of the ooze's turn,

23:35.220 --> 23:39.020
the ooze kind of stops at the threshold to the hallway

23:40.040 --> 23:42.980
and rumbles a bit and you can feel it in the floor,

23:42.980 --> 23:45.220
but doesn't follow.

23:45.220 --> 23:46.820
It stops right at the threshold.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.780
Yeah, we can drop out of initiative too.

23:48.780 --> 23:50.580
You can just talk this through.

23:50.580 --> 23:52.300
Cindy is unstunned.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.520
Joe Dean has cleaning materials.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.180
Tan continues to just unload his gun.

23:58.180 --> 23:59.540
He's still in the room.

23:59.820 --> 24:01.900
It's blocking the doorway.

24:01.900 --> 24:02.740
Back out slowly.

24:02.740 --> 24:03.560
I thought he got out.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.400
I thought he got out.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.240
I thought you were out.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you were out.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.700
No, I was in the room shooting at him.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.020
But then we all ran out.

24:12.020 --> 24:13.260
I didn't run out though.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.940
But you described shooting at it from where Joe was.

24:15.940 --> 24:16.900
Yeah, I thought you were shooting at it

24:16.900 --> 24:19.980
when you shot its tentacle out of the door crack.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.740
You were close to the tentacle impact, I thought.

24:21.740 --> 24:22.580
Maybe I was wrong.

24:22.580 --> 24:25.060
I was imagining I was in the room.

24:25.060 --> 24:26.060
But thankfully you weren't,

24:26.060 --> 24:27.500
because then you'd be dead.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.340
Yeah.

24:29.340 --> 24:31.940
Oh, thank God Luke wasn't in that room.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.380
You can be wherever you wanna be, Luke.

24:34.380 --> 24:35.220
This is an imagination.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.220
I'm still in the room and I unload my gun on it

24:38.220 --> 24:39.860
because it's blocking the doorway.

24:39.860 --> 24:41.420
Okay, shoot away.

24:41.420 --> 24:43.340
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

24:43.340 --> 24:45.620
Four shots and then the chamber's empty.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.520
And they all hit.

24:50.960 --> 24:51.800
Roll damage.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.540
But not very well, two.

24:57.460 --> 25:01.820
Oh, so two, you don't quite hit the first edge

25:01.820 --> 25:02.900
that you hit for one,

25:02.900 --> 25:06.100
nor this more center mass you hit for, I believe, six.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.220
You hit it, doesn't seem to do a lot.

25:09.220 --> 25:12.220
But now, apparently, your back is against the wall.

25:12.220 --> 25:15.220
Pseudopod is kind of blocking that double door

25:15.220 --> 25:17.060
and it's everyone else's turn?

25:17.060 --> 25:18.060
Sounds about right.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.620
Okay, Joe Dean,

25:19.620 --> 25:22.660
you are in that current portion of initiative.

25:23.660 --> 25:25.340
You have cleaning supplies.

25:25.340 --> 25:28.020
Fan's in there, he's in there.

25:28.020 --> 25:31.620
Yeah, yeah, he is, and Joe Dean just starts.

25:31.620 --> 25:33.260
He's gonna take his cigarette lighter

25:33.260 --> 25:38.260
and a half can of aerosol air spray from the bathroom

25:38.260 --> 25:40.540
and he's gonna fucking torch this thing.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.060
Okay, nice improvised little flamethrower.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.020
You are gonna be close enough, though,

25:45.020 --> 25:47.140
that it probably could lash out at you next turn,

25:47.140 --> 25:49.300
just as an FYI, but.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.740
I knew the risks when I signed up for Delta Green.

25:51.740 --> 25:56.740
I am gonna call that just firearms, I guess.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.220
16.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.060
All right, 16 under something high.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.820
Yeah, because you are the guy with a 70

26:04.820 --> 26:06.620
who doesn't carry a weapon.

26:06.620 --> 26:07.900
Okay, great.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.940
Give me a D6 damage for that.

26:13.580 --> 26:14.420
Two.

26:14.420 --> 26:19.100
Even though it was a two, it seems to actually affect it.

26:19.140 --> 26:22.620
The flame touching it seems to burn some of the metal,

26:22.620 --> 26:26.180
almost make the metallic goo kind of solidify

26:26.180 --> 26:29.220
and become solid, and there's no real sound,

26:29.220 --> 26:31.940
but it rumbles a bit, but that part of the surface

26:31.940 --> 26:34.900
towards the front that you were most adjacent to

26:34.900 --> 26:36.580
seems to cook a little bit.

26:36.580 --> 26:40.300
As Cindy shakes herself out of this haze that she's in,

26:40.300 --> 26:43.940
she yells to Tanner, who's trapped in this room

26:43.940 --> 26:47.660
with all of this broken down wood from the table.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.420
You gotta set it on fire!

26:49.420 --> 26:51.860
You gotta set it all on fire!

26:51.860 --> 26:56.580
And then she looks to Harlan and Joe and is like,

26:56.580 --> 26:58.660
we need to get everything that can burn,

26:58.660 --> 27:00.340
we need to barricade this door,

27:00.340 --> 27:02.780
and we need to light it on fire from this side.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.940
We have lost Tanner, but he is gonna go out

27:05.940 --> 27:08.060
taking this thing down with him.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.860
Harlan is taking orders from a drill sergeant

27:10.860 --> 27:14.340
and is now beelining for another office on this floor

27:14.340 --> 27:17.020
to find another table or chairs or anything

27:17.420 --> 27:19.660
to help with building a fire barricade.

27:19.660 --> 27:21.420
You can find that, no problem.

27:21.420 --> 27:22.820
What do you do with the laptop, though?

27:22.820 --> 27:26.740
He's gonna leave it on the floor, but far away.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.460
What if you, you've got computer science, right?

27:28.460 --> 27:30.140
Yeah, I thought it would be unrealistic

27:30.140 --> 27:32.820
for me to sit down and work on it.

27:32.820 --> 27:34.500
I thought about that.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.900
You've got all the stuff, that's good,

27:35.900 --> 27:38.300
now open up that laptop, start looking through it

27:38.300 --> 27:39.820
as we light this thing on fire.

27:39.820 --> 27:40.660
You got it!

27:41.900 --> 27:42.740
Oh, look at him die.

27:42.740 --> 27:44.220
Give me a computer science roll.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.220
That's a critical fail!

27:50.220 --> 27:51.060
No!

27:53.340 --> 27:54.900
That's a 88.

27:54.900 --> 27:55.740
You're gonna make the metal stronger.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.100
You got nothing.

27:58.260 --> 28:02.020
In your panic, you start typing away at the computer,

28:02.020 --> 28:03.580
there's a password screen,

28:03.580 --> 28:06.220
and it's a military-grade laptop, like I said,

28:06.220 --> 28:10.220
and kind of in your haste, you mess something up

28:10.220 --> 28:12.620
and it went into a five-minute timeout.

28:12.620 --> 28:13.820
Football, one, two, three.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.380
Football, one, two, three, four.

28:16.380 --> 28:20.220
Watch this guy, one, watch this guy, two.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.140
So Cindy, you scream, did you do anything else?

28:24.140 --> 28:29.140
She's going to assist now that the barricade has been built

28:29.140 --> 28:32.020
and go ahead and attempt to light this thing on fire.

28:32.020 --> 28:34.500
Helping Jodine, Jodine has a lighter, she knows,

28:34.500 --> 28:37.020
so she's trying to help him start this fire.

28:37.020 --> 28:41.300
She takes just the most prickly sweater

28:41.300 --> 28:44.340
that she has in her backpack and pulls it out

28:44.340 --> 28:47.460
and it's just like a fire starter, this thing.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.300
You're looking at it, if you light it-

28:49.300 --> 28:50.140
Twisted fire starter?

28:50.140 --> 28:52.620
The whole thing is just going to go off.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.260
You just know it, David.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.100
Yeah, that was before they had good safety,

28:57.100 --> 28:59.300
like when it came to clothing, like those-

28:59.300 --> 29:01.020
Safety sweaters. They show you the dummy.

29:01.020 --> 29:03.580
Yeah, they show you the dummy and like it catches a spark

29:03.580 --> 29:05.260
and the person just like combusts.

29:06.540 --> 29:08.580
Yeah, so rather than immolate herself,

29:08.580 --> 29:11.820
she's going to finally be rid of this dangerous sweater.

29:11.820 --> 29:13.700
Good, now you're not going to be able to light it,

29:13.900 --> 29:15.020
it's going to be on Jodine's turn, right?

29:15.020 --> 29:15.860
Right.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.260
Okay, so sweater is down, great.

29:18.260 --> 29:21.180
Top of the round, pseudopod is going to lash out again

29:21.180 --> 29:25.860
from the slime, but unfortunately this time,

29:25.860 --> 29:27.900
tan is going to be on the receiving end of it.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.220
So you can feel free to roll me a dodge,

29:30.220 --> 29:32.100
but it does not like being shot at.

29:33.740 --> 29:36.020
I have a 14 under a 35, what do you got?

29:36.020 --> 29:37.900
Oh, I got a 95.

29:39.540 --> 29:40.380
Under?

29:41.380 --> 29:44.900
Oh yeah, I have a hundred actually in dodge.

29:44.900 --> 29:47.740
Very nimble tanner lube hide.

29:47.740 --> 29:51.540
All right, you are going to take five points of damage.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.660
Five points of damage.

29:53.660 --> 29:57.020
Okay, that brings me down to 10 points of damage.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.900
You can't lube hide from this thing.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.740
At least you didn't really take half your HP though

30:00.740 --> 30:02.100
this time, so you're not stunned,

30:02.100 --> 30:05.980
but this time it lashes out and then cracks you.

30:06.100 --> 30:06.940
Can't lube hide.

30:09.260 --> 30:10.780
Say it in the microphone like a man.

30:10.780 --> 30:14.060
I couldn't see, I couldn't hear what you said.

30:14.060 --> 30:15.100
I just heard my name.

30:15.100 --> 30:15.940
Say it.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.820
I'm sorry, I didn't intend to interrupt.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.660
You can say it now.

30:18.660 --> 30:23.660
I pointed out, he can lube run, but he can't lube hide.

30:25.460 --> 30:26.380
Incredible.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.140
It's good, you just have to put names in it

30:30.140 --> 30:31.340
and it gets even better.

30:31.340 --> 30:36.340
Yeah, so it punches me or like what happens?

30:36.740 --> 30:39.260
Yeah, yeah, five damage manifested in the way

30:39.260 --> 30:41.420
of it lashes out at you instead of hitting you

30:41.420 --> 30:43.300
right in the bread basket like Cindy,

30:43.300 --> 30:48.060
it hits you in the shins and cracks one of your shins

30:48.060 --> 30:52.100
and you feel your weight on that leg and it hurts,

30:52.100 --> 30:54.180
but you're still up, it doesn't knock you down.

30:54.180 --> 30:55.580
You still have your Magnum.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.980
You did not actually shoot four rounds last round.

30:57.980 --> 30:59.580
So you still have bullets in it.

30:59.580 --> 31:02.620
And that brings us to you.

31:02.620 --> 31:07.500
So yeah, Tan is like, what the fuck is going on?

31:07.500 --> 31:11.660
Like he sees them start barricading him inside of here

31:11.660 --> 31:14.460
and he's not happy about that at all.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.260
His shin is like all fucked up.

31:16.260 --> 31:20.500
He takes a package of skull out of his back pocket

31:20.500 --> 31:23.540
and puts the whole thing, huge dip in his mouth

31:23.540 --> 31:25.420
and it temporarily, you know.

31:25.420 --> 31:27.740
I think that gives you advantage on rolls.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.180
Unfortunately it is your whole turn.

31:29.740 --> 31:30.860
I was going to say, I think it temporarily

31:30.860 --> 31:35.420
gives me a little boost, but he holsters his Magnum

31:35.420 --> 31:40.300
and he wants to just try to jump over the barricade

31:40.300 --> 31:41.780
and out the door.

31:43.180 --> 31:47.140
Okay, so you want to do a run and leap.

31:47.140 --> 31:48.220
A running leap.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.580
High jump over the metal ooze.

31:50.580 --> 31:54.500
Over the ooze, over the barricade, out the door.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.060
If he makes it out of here, he's going to have

31:56.060 --> 31:58.220
some choice words for these motherfuckers.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.860
All I'm going to say is I really hope you took athletics

32:02.860 --> 32:05.900
because this is going to be an athletics role.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.500
This, remember, and here's the issue.

32:08.500 --> 32:12.500
This pile was like half the room.

32:12.500 --> 32:16.540
And so it's covering, this is a leap

32:16.540 --> 32:18.860
and not like leap and stay on your feet.

32:18.860 --> 32:21.300
This is like the full forward dive.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.300
I'm going head first.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.060
Which is why he's going to use pilot.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.020
Yeah, yes.

32:25.020 --> 32:30.020
Make me an athletics at a minus 20.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.420
Otherwise you're landing in the goo.

32:36.420 --> 32:41.420
I failed a 65 on with my minus 20 of 50.

32:42.980 --> 32:45.220
Oh shit, you were good at athletics.

32:47.580 --> 32:52.180
As I'm running and leaping, the force that I put on my leg

32:52.220 --> 32:54.540
finishes the break in my leg

32:54.540 --> 32:56.580
and it just snaps underneath my weight.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.020
And I fall within inches of the blob.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.540
Just before it.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.060
Before it, not after it.

33:09.060 --> 33:09.900
So you didn't?

33:09.900 --> 33:10.740
I didn't make it over.

33:10.740 --> 33:14.100
No, as soon as I like tried to jump, my leg snapped

33:14.100 --> 33:17.140
and I just fell down and my head is like two inches away

33:17.140 --> 33:18.860
from the edge of the goo blob.

33:18.860 --> 33:20.860
You fall down next to the blob

33:20.900 --> 33:23.660
and really close to just a randomly placed Aldermen's

33:23.660 --> 33:25.380
like blank face.

33:27.260 --> 33:30.780
Just staring out in the distance, not at you,

33:30.780 --> 33:34.020
but just lifelessly peering out of the goo at you

33:34.020 --> 33:36.980
as you flop on the ground with your now broken,

33:36.980 --> 33:38.060
fully broken chin.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.340
Civic gooverment.

33:43.660 --> 33:45.060
There's your episode title.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.980
Yeah, there's the blank face next to him,

33:49.980 --> 33:52.300
but if he looked up into the doorway

33:52.300 --> 33:56.260
whereas his fellow Delta Green or Greenies

33:57.420 --> 34:01.060
are, he would see Joe Dean's like face staring at him

34:01.060 --> 34:05.060
very intently and he looks sad and then he looks determined

34:05.060 --> 34:09.660
and you see Harlan on one side and Cindy on the other,

34:09.660 --> 34:12.380
like closing the big doors.

34:12.380 --> 34:16.660
As they do, he takes his spray can, flamethrower

34:16.660 --> 34:19.300
and blast it onto the wood.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.780
Tan is on the ground, face down on the ground,

34:21.780 --> 34:24.380
just yelling, how could you do this to me,

34:24.380 --> 34:26.660
you fucking monsters?

34:28.180 --> 34:29.020
Fair.

34:29.020 --> 34:29.860
Yeah, super fair.

34:29.860 --> 34:32.820
I want the other three of you to roll sanity.

34:35.060 --> 34:35.900
Yeah.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.340
Pass, 26.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.060
It's a pass with a seven.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.580
They don't give a shit about me.

34:43.580 --> 34:44.900
I actually fail.

34:44.900 --> 34:48.660
Yeah, Cindy fails, 52 over 38.

34:48.660 --> 34:50.300
It was that tattoo bond.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.380
It was the tattoos.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.780
That's gonna be two sanity

34:52.780 --> 34:54.300
and then the other two of you are fine.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.660
That's a breaking point, sir.

34:55.660 --> 34:56.740
Oh, is it now?

34:56.740 --> 34:57.580
Ruh-roh.

34:57.580 --> 35:01.060
Unless you wanna project, but if you're anything like Luke,

35:01.060 --> 35:02.860
you like your bonds too much to do that.

35:02.860 --> 35:06.020
I would never ever do that to my grandson, Wally,

35:06.020 --> 35:08.580
nor my gambling friend, Sharla.

35:10.180 --> 35:11.020
That's fair.

35:11.020 --> 35:12.300
In what disorder do you have already?

35:12.300 --> 35:16.900
A need for making others uncomfortable.

35:16.900 --> 35:17.740
Okay.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.500
You're gonna cheat people at a distance.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.420
You're gonna pick up some amnesia.

35:24.180 --> 35:26.980
Not being able to necessarily piece things back together.

35:26.980 --> 35:29.620
David wants you to stop having those flashback episodes.

35:29.620 --> 35:33.020
No, I think he's saying more, more.

35:36.820 --> 35:38.820
I'm glad you can read between the lines.

35:40.940 --> 35:44.460
And in that moment, Cindy's eyes roll in the back of her head.

35:44.460 --> 35:48.820
This sanity check has really taken her to a dark place.

35:48.820 --> 35:51.180
She watches these memories disappear.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.020
Number one.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.700
Riding a bike.

35:54.700 --> 35:57.900
Her husband was trying to hurt her grandson, Wally.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.740
No, no.

36:00.740 --> 36:02.220
With some natural force.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.260
Oh, he got one in there.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.100
Slit it in.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.100
He got one in anyway.

36:05.100 --> 36:08.340
Let's roll damage on that fire

36:08.340 --> 36:13.140
as Tan is no longer visible, as the doors ignite,

36:13.140 --> 36:16.860
the sweater ignites and whatever solvents you threw in.

36:16.860 --> 36:20.420
First, a check to see if we get a crit success

36:20.420 --> 36:22.940
or a crit failure firearms again

36:22.940 --> 36:24.980
to see the effectiveness of this.

36:26.380 --> 36:27.820
60 on a 70.

36:27.820 --> 36:29.460
So success, that's good.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.020
And then I'm gonna need damage.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.060
There's a lot more accelerant now.

36:33.060 --> 36:36.860
So in fact, I'm gonna want you to roll 2D8 on this.

36:36.860 --> 36:37.700
Ooh.

36:37.700 --> 36:38.540
Ooh.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.780
One and four, five.

36:46.740 --> 36:49.940
It cooks a bit more, but now it's out of your vision.

36:49.940 --> 36:53.980
You're not quite sure exactly what happened to it

36:53.980 --> 36:58.140
now that the doors are on fire and oh,

36:58.140 --> 37:00.140
the whole town hall is starting to catch a flame.

37:00.140 --> 37:00.980
Good.

37:00.980 --> 37:01.820
Good, yeah.

37:01.820 --> 37:02.660
Good.

37:02.660 --> 37:04.420
Yeah, that was a plus in my mind from the get go.

37:04.420 --> 37:07.060
If that wasn't happening, that was my plan.

37:07.060 --> 37:07.900
Yeah, right.

37:09.140 --> 37:09.980
What do you do?

37:09.980 --> 37:12.540
Tan stands up and he's like one leg

37:12.540 --> 37:15.460
hopping over to the window that's like barricaded

37:15.460 --> 37:18.180
by the wood, the table, the whatever, you know,

37:18.180 --> 37:20.520
just trying to rip that off the window.

37:20.520 --> 37:24.380
Give me a strength check to see if you can get it loose.

37:24.380 --> 37:25.780
Strength times five, I mean.

37:27.740 --> 37:28.940
92.

37:28.940 --> 37:31.500
I stand up and as I'm like trying to jerk

37:31.500 --> 37:35.100
the like barricade stuff off, I...

37:35.100 --> 37:40.100
That was surprisingly unintentional.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.540
That was good, yeah.

37:45.540 --> 37:48.300
As I'm trying to rip that off, I...

37:48.300 --> 37:50.140
You shout, winners is coming.

37:52.060 --> 37:55.540
Tan puts, in order to get some leverage,

37:55.540 --> 37:58.740
he puts some weight on his broken leg

37:58.740 --> 38:01.340
and just collapses again.

38:01.340 --> 38:04.300
And as he collapses, part of his like shin bone

38:04.340 --> 38:05.900
is like poking out of his leg.

38:07.380 --> 38:10.640
We just hear his anguished scream.

38:10.640 --> 38:11.480
Ah!

38:13.740 --> 38:15.500
As we're booking it down the stairs.

38:15.500 --> 38:18.220
Joe Dean is just like spraying everything he can

38:18.220 --> 38:20.380
with this flamethrower like lighter set up.

38:20.380 --> 38:23.220
Cindy takes one last look back down the hallway

38:23.220 --> 38:25.540
before we make our way to the stairwell.

38:25.540 --> 38:26.700
Harlan's grabbing the computer.

38:26.700 --> 38:28.900
So the three of you are just, you grab the computer,

38:28.900 --> 38:31.740
you're booking it down, you see the doors are burning,

38:31.740 --> 38:33.260
you can see smoke kind of coming through

38:33.260 --> 38:36.940
the crack of the door, see the fire starting to radiate out

38:36.940 --> 38:38.340
and catch more of the hallway.

38:38.340 --> 38:41.060
A lot of this town hall, even though it's stone

38:41.060 --> 38:43.260
on the outside, there's still a lot of wood inside.

38:43.260 --> 38:45.400
It's that old retro wooden paneling,

38:45.400 --> 38:47.780
similar to what you saw in the original room

38:47.780 --> 38:50.220
at the FBI briefing.

38:50.220 --> 38:51.380
And it's igniting.

38:51.380 --> 38:54.100
So the three of you are gonna be able to get outside

38:54.100 --> 38:58.940
this round and Tan, still alive.

38:58.940 --> 39:00.820
There's a lot of smoke though.

39:00.820 --> 39:05.260
So for him to try one last time to rip open that window,

39:05.260 --> 39:08.300
I'm gonna need a con times five check first

39:08.300 --> 39:12.300
to see if he can overcome the smoke filling up his lungs

39:12.300 --> 39:14.780
to use just one last burst of strength.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.980
That's a nine on a 60.

39:25.100 --> 39:26.780
You're able to hold your breath.

39:26.780 --> 39:29.780
You don't let the smoke kind of overtake your lungs.

39:29.780 --> 39:31.980
You still have enough oxygen in your bloodstream

39:31.980 --> 39:35.720
to pull one more time at the board on the window.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.720
Yeah, he picks himself back up.

39:38.720 --> 39:41.140
He checks the chamber of his gun

39:41.140 --> 39:43.600
and he's got three shots left.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.080
And at the edge of like the wood,

39:46.080 --> 39:49.300
this barricading the door, he just like fires into it

39:49.300 --> 39:51.300
to try to like break it up a little bit

39:51.300 --> 39:54.260
and then attempts to reach into the hole he's made

39:54.260 --> 39:55.500
and pull it off.

39:56.660 --> 39:57.540
Give me that strength.

39:57.540 --> 39:58.860
35 pass.

39:58.860 --> 40:01.780
You shoot it, point blank, splinter it a bit,

40:01.780 --> 40:04.740
get it a little bit more loose, pops to the side.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.880
There's smoke now pouring out

40:06.880 --> 40:09.940
of that second story window of town hall

40:09.940 --> 40:12.540
and your body is kind of just hanging out

40:12.540 --> 40:15.820
at that first bit of fresh air, you gasp,

40:18.980 --> 40:19.820
clear your lungs out,

40:19.820 --> 40:23.020
but now you feel behind you the heat radiating

40:23.020 --> 40:25.860
and that hot, hot smoke coming out behind you.

40:25.860 --> 40:28.380
You can feel it almost discoloring your clothes.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.740
It's such an intense burning right now.

40:30.740 --> 40:31.660
What do you do?

40:31.660 --> 40:34.940
Speaking of con checks, I want to check for Jennifer Khan.

40:34.940 --> 40:36.740
How would you check for her?

40:36.740 --> 40:37.580
Would you?

40:37.580 --> 40:38.700
As we're like running down,

40:38.700 --> 40:40.420
like assume we're passing her desk.

40:40.420 --> 40:42.260
Oh yeah, I shout, Khan!

40:46.020 --> 40:48.140
How would you check for her?

40:48.140 --> 40:50.060
I didn't get it at first.

40:50.060 --> 40:50.900
Good note, Joe.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.820
There's no Khan, no response from Khan.

40:56.820 --> 40:57.660
Khan!

40:59.220 --> 41:01.860
Quick, if we get outside,

41:01.860 --> 41:03.620
if he's trying to get out that window,

41:03.620 --> 41:06.060
which we know he's trying to survive this,

41:06.060 --> 41:09.140
then maybe we can grab that fitted sheet on three sides

41:09.140 --> 41:10.740
and pull it tight enough to catch him.

41:10.740 --> 41:13.380
Yeah, or maybe we put one in his corpse

41:13.380 --> 41:15.540
when he hits, you know, when he hits the ground,

41:15.540 --> 41:16.480
put one in his head.

41:16.480 --> 41:18.220
You're not going to have time to get the sheet.

41:18.220 --> 41:19.980
The fitted sheet from the hotel.

41:20.980 --> 41:21.820
We scream.

41:23.540 --> 41:24.780
Right clicker!

41:24.780 --> 41:25.620
There!

41:27.060 --> 41:28.480
When I'm looking out the window,

41:28.480 --> 41:31.300
is there like a ledge that I can like get onto

41:31.300 --> 41:33.520
and try to like at least lower myself

41:33.520 --> 41:35.420
like five more feet before I just.

41:35.420 --> 41:38.060
Yep, there's a stone ledge and below you,

41:38.060 --> 41:39.580
it's somewhat garden.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.260
There's some really low bushes

41:41.260 --> 41:43.420
and then also just some ground.

41:43.420 --> 41:45.460
Okay, so I, yeah, so.

41:46.620 --> 41:47.460
Roll him luck.

41:47.460 --> 41:48.300
Roll luck.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.120
Roll me luck.

41:49.120 --> 41:49.960
Let me set this up first.

41:49.960 --> 41:50.780
Roll luck.

41:50.780 --> 41:51.620
You set it up.

41:51.620 --> 41:52.460
Okay, set it up, set it up.

41:52.460 --> 41:53.740
The man gets out on the ledge.

41:53.740 --> 41:56.900
He like crawls down and like hangs off the ledge.

41:56.900 --> 42:00.020
So he's, you know, like a little bit closer to the ground.

42:00.020 --> 42:00.980
And it's like a really short,

42:00.980 --> 42:02.940
and basically his feet are just like

42:02.940 --> 42:05.340
pretty much dangling right above the ground.

42:05.340 --> 42:06.520
He looks down and he sees,

42:06.520 --> 42:09.500
there's either like pavement or bushes

42:09.500 --> 42:13.020
and he's going to like try to swing himself into the bushes

42:13.020 --> 42:15.500
and try to land like horizontally onto them.

42:15.500 --> 42:20.500
And it, and he loses his grip.

42:24.100 --> 42:28.580
He loses his grip while he's swinging and starts falling.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.860
Just so you know that a fail, a fail on my luck check.

42:31.860 --> 42:33.940
Because you lowered yourself down,

42:33.940 --> 42:37.060
you went from a distance where we'd be rolling

42:37.060 --> 42:41.100
a lethality roll to actually control the amount of damage.

42:41.100 --> 42:41.940
Hell yes.

42:41.940 --> 42:44.140
So you're going to take two D six damage.

42:46.420 --> 42:51.420
Six damage as you belly flop down into some mulch,

42:52.340 --> 42:55.860
no hedges, maybe some low flowers.

42:57.420 --> 42:59.500
Now I need a contest as well.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.340
Con times five check that comes after the fall.

43:03.340 --> 43:06.100
That is a success 13 on a 60.

43:06.100 --> 43:09.020
So you flop, stomach down,

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
but not hard enough for you to lose your breath

43:11.020 --> 43:12.220
and become stunned.

43:12.220 --> 43:14.740
Anyone who survives the fall has to see if they're stunned.

43:15.220 --> 43:17.940
Okay. I did, but I did, I did just take,

43:17.940 --> 43:19.740
I'm down to four hit points.

43:19.740 --> 43:22.020
So I took more than half, took more than half.

43:22.020 --> 43:23.340
But was that what that role was?

43:23.340 --> 43:24.740
No, that was for the fall.

43:24.740 --> 43:26.420
So you're stunned anyway.

43:26.420 --> 43:27.300
Yeah. Fair.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.220
Yeah. When I fall it, yeah.

43:29.220 --> 43:30.820
I land horizontally.

43:30.820 --> 43:33.440
I like brace my head with my arm as I fall.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.220
So I don't like whack my head.

43:35.220 --> 43:38.300
Breath is knocked out of me and I'm like, I can't move.

43:38.300 --> 43:39.580
I can't function right now.

43:39.580 --> 43:40.500
At least you got out.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.520
Joe Dean looks over at Harlan

43:43.520 --> 43:46.520
and he, he looks at the gun he carries and he says,

43:47.760 --> 43:49.480
do you have what it takes to do it?

43:49.480 --> 43:52.280
Or will you give me that gun?

43:52.280 --> 43:55.280
I, I think I should, I should,

43:55.280 --> 43:57.520
I think I should work on the computer here.

43:57.520 --> 44:01.760
He takes his, he takes his pistol and walks over to tan.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.280
Who's screaming.

44:03.280 --> 44:04.120
Yeah.

44:04.120 --> 44:04.960
Fuck!

44:06.280 --> 44:07.120
Yes!

44:08.880 --> 44:11.040
Oh, thank God.

44:11.040 --> 44:12.280
Help me.

44:12.280 --> 44:13.120
You need to.

44:13.120 --> 44:13.940
You piece of shit.

44:13.940 --> 44:15.280
Fuck you, by the way.

44:15.280 --> 44:16.120
Fair.

44:16.120 --> 44:17.680
But you got to keep your voice down kid.

44:17.680 --> 44:19.920
Can't be heard screaming like this.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.740
Just, ah.

44:23.740 --> 44:25.000
I reach my hands out.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.040
Birds?

44:34.440 --> 44:35.880
A flock of birds?

44:35.880 --> 44:37.680
A bunch of pigeons from the roof.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.360
No.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.480
Holy shit, dude.

44:40.480 --> 44:42.120
I don't think he can do it.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.360
He turns and looks at Cindy.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.340
All right, then you have to carry him.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.320
All right.

44:53.040 --> 44:57.320
And I, yeah, I pick his broken body up from the ground

44:57.320 --> 45:00.940
and, and like fireman carry him away from there.

45:00.940 --> 45:03.080
Yeah, let's get to the Bronco stat.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.780
You get him into the Bronco.

45:04.780 --> 45:05.960
The building is burning.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.120
It is a raging inferno now.

45:09.120 --> 45:12.360
You don't see Khan, no matter how loud you scream.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.840
But remember the town hall is right in the center

45:15.840 --> 45:19.240
of Grover'sville and around it,

45:19.240 --> 45:21.220
there was the Sheriff's office next door,

45:21.220 --> 45:23.200
the town library, the post office.

45:23.200 --> 45:27.920
Just as you're getting into the Bronco and the inferno,

45:27.920 --> 45:31.640
you're confident that pile of goo is thoroughly cooked

45:31.640 --> 45:32.480
at this point.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.780
It seemed as though fire is what really could damage it.

45:36.780 --> 45:40.420
But almost as soon as fire fully engulfs the upper floor

45:40.420 --> 45:44.260
of the building, you see people in town walking out

45:44.260 --> 45:46.780
of their places of business.

45:46.780 --> 45:49.780
You see the Sheriff, Dan Oakley, who you would talk to,

45:49.780 --> 45:52.940
some of his deputies kind of just walking out in front

45:52.940 --> 45:54.820
of the Sheriff's office.

45:54.820 --> 45:58.980
You see the presumably librarian walk out of the library.

45:58.980 --> 46:01.660
Some postal workers walk out of the post office.

46:01.660 --> 46:03.540
Murrell's auto and body is right there.

46:03.540 --> 46:05.220
Some of the mechanics walk out.

46:05.700 --> 46:07.140
And you can see even in the distance,

46:07.140 --> 46:09.660
some of the further businesses, everyone's walking out,

46:09.660 --> 46:12.460
but they're not walking out looking at the fire

46:12.460 --> 46:13.920
or looking at you.

46:13.920 --> 46:18.920
They walk out and you see them grasping at their necks

46:19.300 --> 46:24.300
and body as they just start uncontrollably vomiting

46:25.320 --> 46:28.740
and coughing so loud and violently.

46:28.740 --> 46:31.300
You can see almost their eyes go bloodshot.

46:31.300 --> 46:35.420
They're coughing so hard as capillaries burst in their eyes

46:35.420 --> 46:39.780
and slowly they all just keel over.

46:39.780 --> 46:41.500
And everyone that walked out,

46:41.500 --> 46:44.020
whether it's the Sheriff's librarian,

46:44.020 --> 46:45.780
you're sitting in the Bronco watching this

46:45.780 --> 46:49.580
within a couple of minutes, no movement.

46:49.580 --> 46:50.420
What about us?

46:50.420 --> 46:51.620
Yeah, how are we feeling?

46:51.620 --> 46:53.060
We don't give a shit about them.

46:53.060 --> 46:53.900
Yeah.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.460
No, that's fucking crazy though.

46:57.460 --> 46:58.700
That's so fucking awesome.

46:58.700 --> 47:00.100
That's a really cool scene.

47:01.060 --> 47:04.060
Joe, unfortunately, and by Joe, I mean, Harlan.

47:04.060 --> 47:05.020
My partner, oh.

47:07.260 --> 47:08.740
Oh, Joe.

47:08.740 --> 47:09.580
Yeah.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.340
He starts to not feel good as well.

47:13.180 --> 47:17.020
There's something wrong.

47:17.020 --> 47:17.860
What happened?

47:17.860 --> 47:19.380
Did he fall out a fucking window?

47:22.020 --> 47:23.260
I should have shot him.

47:24.340 --> 47:25.380
He's angry.

47:25.380 --> 47:26.380
He's very mad.

47:27.340 --> 47:32.340
Joe, you start to feel inside your body in your lower back

47:32.460 --> 47:35.740
around where your kidneys are, your intestines,

47:35.740 --> 47:37.940
an intense amount of pain.

47:37.940 --> 47:42.580
And as you feel that pain, it starts to move further up

47:42.580 --> 47:46.340
almost as if your organs are reorganizing themselves

47:46.340 --> 47:48.740
up into your stomach, into your chest

47:48.740 --> 47:50.300
and it gets harder and harder to breathe

47:50.300 --> 47:55.020
and you can feel yourself also slowly asphyxiating.

47:55.060 --> 47:56.900
I imagine that he was in the back seat

47:56.900 --> 47:59.700
and he is now pushing himself against the back of the seat

47:59.700 --> 48:01.860
and he's now kind of going back over

48:01.860 --> 48:03.940
and he's now in the back of the Bronco writhing

48:03.940 --> 48:05.460
in that space back there.

48:08.700 --> 48:11.060
Presumably all over the shattered body of.

48:11.060 --> 48:13.220
Yeah, you stepped on me for sure.

48:14.300 --> 48:15.660
Does anyone do anything?

48:15.660 --> 48:16.500
No.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.140
No, I lay there.

48:18.140 --> 48:19.340
No one took medicine.

48:19.340 --> 48:20.700
No one took medicine.

48:20.700 --> 48:22.180
No one can do anything.

48:22.220 --> 48:25.700
I mean, I try to show him his own pistol.

48:25.700 --> 48:28.020
I ask if he wants this to end.

48:28.020 --> 48:29.740
I think yes, but I'll double check with David.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.500
Is this the kind of excruciating,

48:31.500 --> 48:33.380
am I experiencing death at this point

48:33.380 --> 48:35.460
or do I feel like I could do something?

48:35.460 --> 48:37.260
Having watched what happened to everyone else,

48:37.260 --> 48:39.740
it happened to everyone else much quicker,

48:39.740 --> 48:41.620
but you can feel those coughs coming on.

48:41.620 --> 48:44.740
You can feel your eyes, just the pressure against it

48:44.740 --> 48:47.940
from gasping for breath plus the coughs.

48:47.940 --> 48:49.940
You're not vomiting uncontrollably or anything

48:49.940 --> 48:52.380
at this point, but it doesn't look good.

48:52.380 --> 48:55.060
Through spasms in his body, wracking his body,

48:55.060 --> 48:58.060
he is trying his hardest to nod yes with eyes bleeding.

48:59.540 --> 49:00.460
Oh, woof.

49:00.460 --> 49:02.540
Cindy looks in the rear view mirror.

49:02.540 --> 49:03.500
Do it.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.060
I open the back of the Bronco

49:05.060 --> 49:08.340
and I just drag Harlan out like a sack of potatoes

49:08.340 --> 49:10.780
by the scruff of his shirt.

49:10.780 --> 49:14.780
I'm sorry, I liked your polos

49:14.780 --> 49:16.460
and he puts one between the eyes.

49:16.460 --> 49:17.540
I'm gonna roll dodge.

49:20.420 --> 49:21.620
Oh, the alien got him.

49:25.100 --> 49:25.940
Get in.

49:27.060 --> 49:28.100
We have to call.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.300
Where's the Crown Vic?

49:29.300 --> 49:30.140
It's at the hotel.

49:30.140 --> 49:30.980
All right, let's go.

49:30.980 --> 49:32.060
No, it's here, it's here.

49:32.060 --> 49:33.140
Let's ditch the Bronco.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.340
We get in the DEA car.

49:34.340 --> 49:36.900
We need to get on the phone and call Derringer, stat.

49:36.900 --> 49:39.820
And I put Harlan in the trunk of the DEA car.

49:39.820 --> 49:41.700
You really are fucking monsters.

49:41.700 --> 49:44.220
Get in the back and shut the fuck up.

49:44.220 --> 49:45.220
Jesus, too much.

49:46.220 --> 49:47.740
No, not really.

49:47.740 --> 49:49.140
Not really.

49:49.180 --> 49:50.020
Appropriate.

49:50.020 --> 49:50.860
It's fitting.

49:50.860 --> 49:53.940
And she's gonna call our handler Derringer

49:53.940 --> 49:58.700
at a number that is likely being listened to, she assumes.

49:58.700 --> 50:01.180
Bring, bring, bring, bring.

50:01.180 --> 50:03.380
Yeah, we knock and ring the doorbell, too.

50:06.140 --> 50:07.580
Yeah?

50:07.580 --> 50:08.420
Who is it?

50:08.420 --> 50:10.220
It's Woodabaga.

50:10.220 --> 50:11.340
We're leaving.

50:11.340 --> 50:13.060
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop.

50:13.060 --> 50:14.060
Where are you calling from?

50:14.060 --> 50:15.740
The car.

50:15.740 --> 50:17.420
A car phone, nice.

50:18.300 --> 50:20.740
They haven't really learned to track those

50:20.740 --> 50:22.220
or listen to those as well.

50:22.220 --> 50:24.420
I'll keep that in mind as I tell you everything.

50:24.420 --> 50:26.980
Yeah, smart.

50:26.980 --> 50:27.820
What do you got?

50:27.820 --> 50:30.220
Grover'sville needs a cleanup crew ASAP.

50:30.220 --> 50:33.060
The cover story is that there's a drug

50:33.060 --> 50:35.180
called super meth in the area.

50:35.180 --> 50:36.380
Got into the water supply.

50:36.380 --> 50:40.460
Got into the water supply, took out damn near everyone.

50:40.460 --> 50:42.260
I would say literally everyone.

50:42.260 --> 50:45.460
Maybe we get some plants that say that they survived.

50:45.460 --> 50:46.300
What do you have, Joe?

50:46.340 --> 50:49.100
Well, when we say cleanup, first of all,

50:49.100 --> 50:51.220
hi, hello, hi, it's Joe.

50:52.220 --> 50:53.940
When we say cleanup,

50:53.940 --> 50:56.140
you might have to burn this place to the ground.

50:56.140 --> 50:58.900
Yeah, we're talking 1199 bodies.

50:58.900 --> 51:00.180
And something needs to,

51:00.180 --> 51:03.900
you probably need to send a more specialist team

51:03.900 --> 51:06.380
to maybe investigate the water supply.

51:06.380 --> 51:08.780
Yeah, and a computer scientist.

51:08.780 --> 51:11.580
Oh yeah, we just shot our computer scientist.

51:11.580 --> 51:15.020
We've got information, so we have a laptop.

51:15.180 --> 51:16.020
Wait, what do you have?

51:16.020 --> 51:16.940
Hold on, you have a laptop.

51:16.940 --> 51:18.420
All right, get the laptop here now.

51:18.420 --> 51:19.540
Memphis Field Office,

51:19.540 --> 51:21.620
I'll have a room set up with someone ready to go.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.620
The issue is I cannot get a team there

51:24.620 --> 51:27.820
for at least six to eight hours.

51:27.820 --> 51:29.140
It has to come from DC.

51:29.140 --> 51:30.700
We can't get those resources here.

51:30.700 --> 51:34.180
Well, Grover'sville is at the butt end of the locale,

51:34.180 --> 51:37.260
so I don't think anyone will show up for six to eight hours.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.180
Look, it's fine.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.860
You guys just get out of there.

51:40.700 --> 51:42.140
Hopefully the rest of you are fine,

51:42.140 --> 51:45.020
but just give me that laptop now.

51:45.020 --> 51:48.460
No one is going to be there for at least six hours.

51:48.460 --> 51:52.020
So just get out in case someone else gets there first.

51:52.020 --> 51:54.420
There's no one left in Grover'sville.

51:55.340 --> 51:58.700
So I think the dead will be fine

51:58.700 --> 52:00.300
for the next six or eight hours.

52:01.860 --> 52:05.140
Joe like punches the fucking gas and-

52:05.140 --> 52:06.860
Are you speeding down the highway

52:06.860 --> 52:10.380
in a Crown Vic or a Ford Bronco?

52:10.820 --> 52:12.300
Thankfully, the Crown Vic,

52:12.300 --> 52:15.380
if you could let local authorities know to not pull us over,

52:15.380 --> 52:16.580
we will be speeding.

52:16.580 --> 52:19.900
And Tan is still sitting in the back of the Bronco

52:19.900 --> 52:22.860
that is just sitting in front of City Hall.

52:24.100 --> 52:25.540
Cause no one got me.

52:26.660 --> 52:28.860
Is his dead body in the back of the Bronco too?

52:28.860 --> 52:31.260
We took his dead body, but not your live one.

52:34.460 --> 52:35.860
Cindy was yelling shut the fuck up

52:35.860 --> 52:38.220
to no one in particular in the back seat.

52:41.260 --> 52:42.220
Shut up.

52:42.220 --> 52:44.900
Okay, we're only like a minute outside of town.

52:44.900 --> 52:47.180
So we got to go get that fucking piece of shit.

52:47.180 --> 52:48.220
We saved him once.

52:49.620 --> 52:50.460
Turn around.

52:50.460 --> 52:51.300
I spared his life.

52:51.300 --> 52:54.260
So now I like owe him my air, whatever, how that works.

52:54.260 --> 52:55.080
You know-

52:55.080 --> 52:55.920
Jar Jar Binks clause, I know.

52:55.920 --> 52:56.740
Yeah, exactly.

52:56.740 --> 52:58.220
It's a Jar Jar situation.

52:58.220 --> 53:00.220
Who was a guy we know.

53:00.220 --> 53:03.460
Also, I've given you no reason to dislike me.

53:03.460 --> 53:04.860
Yeah.

53:04.860 --> 53:06.180
We don't dislike you.

53:06.180 --> 53:08.140
It's just the mission.

53:08.140 --> 53:09.260
They called for it.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.740
You're lying in extreme pain in the back of this Bronco,

53:12.740 --> 53:16.180
just like looking at the felt on the roof of it.

53:16.180 --> 53:17.580
Well, I was trying to get out,

53:17.580 --> 53:20.740
but the child blocks are on, so I'm like stuck in there.

53:22.140 --> 53:26.320
Yeah, you hear the Crown Vic like crunch back up

53:26.320 --> 53:27.160
and roll to a stop.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.260
As soon as I hear that,

53:28.260 --> 53:30.340
like all my energy has been expended

53:30.340 --> 53:31.420
trying to get out of here,

53:31.420 --> 53:35.320
but I hear you guys coming back and I just pass out.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.740
Cindy grabs him by the shoulders,

53:36.740 --> 53:39.060
throws him into the back of the Crown Vic

53:39.820 --> 53:43.300
and we bust it to the Memphis field office.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.380
So that's Cindy in the front seat then

53:45.380 --> 53:47.660
and Jodine sitting shotgun.

53:47.660 --> 53:48.480
Yeah.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.580
And then a passed out tan in the back

53:50.580 --> 53:53.580
and then a dead Harlan in the trunk.

53:53.580 --> 53:54.500
That is correct.

53:54.500 --> 53:56.540
That's how all the green ops end.

53:58.220 --> 54:00.980
As you get two miles outside of town

54:00.980 --> 54:03.780
and you're heading Southwest towards Memphis,

54:03.780 --> 54:06.980
lying low in the opposite direction towards town

54:06.980 --> 54:10.540
are three Blackhawk helicopters.

54:10.540 --> 54:11.840
Fuck yeah.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.160
Broken Arrow boys.

54:15.180 --> 54:17.100
Heading the other way towards town

54:17.100 --> 54:19.940
as you drive towards Memphis and scene.

54:19.940 --> 54:23.000
That's scene as far as you know it.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.500
Ooh, hit us with the next scene.

54:25.500 --> 54:27.660
Well, no, I mean, there's not really much of the next scene.

54:27.660 --> 54:28.760
It's kind of how much.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.380
What's the scene we don't know, David?

54:32.380 --> 54:33.500
Tell us secrets.

54:33.500 --> 54:35.780
Well, was that weird at all at the end?

54:35.780 --> 54:37.800
Dude, that was fucking rad.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.540
What doesn't add up at this point?

54:39.540 --> 54:40.720
And what do you want to know?

54:40.720 --> 54:42.420
Who called in that Blackhawk?

54:42.420 --> 54:44.620
What organization had the helicopters flying around?

54:44.620 --> 54:45.740
Yeah, what was that?

54:45.740 --> 54:48.340
So you get that computer back to HQ

54:48.340 --> 54:51.260
and as long as it stays in Delta Green's hands

54:51.260 --> 54:53.100
and they correctly look at it,

54:53.100 --> 54:57.940
it was a communication device between the aldermen in town

54:57.940 --> 55:02.940
and some other civilians, Majestic 12 and the Grays.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.080
Wow.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.520
Wow.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.720
It was the aliens the whole time

55:07.720 --> 55:10.680
abducting these citizens to form the experiments.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.440
And the government was just letting them do it.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.140
Yeah, there was an entire portion of this

55:18.140 --> 55:20.200
where you could have actually confronted the aliens

55:20.200 --> 55:21.960
and fought the aliens themselves.

55:22.960 --> 55:26.100
I tried to ask the aldermen to behave themselves.

55:27.720 --> 55:28.880
They were not interested in discourse.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.320
Where would that have taken place?

55:30.320 --> 55:33.060
A small farm about three miles outside of town.

55:33.060 --> 55:34.740
Where you shot Jane Allen.

55:36.700 --> 55:40.060
That was converted into basically an experimentation area

55:40.060 --> 55:41.100
where all these people were,

55:41.100 --> 55:42.780
where they stored all the gray goo

55:42.780 --> 55:45.500
and they were just injecting this gray goo into people,

55:45.500 --> 55:47.420
more or less replacing people's organs.

55:47.420 --> 55:49.180
So that's what happened to Billy Ray.

55:49.180 --> 55:52.300
They replaced all of his musculature with this goo.

55:52.300 --> 55:56.340
Joe had his digestive organs replaced last night

55:56.340 --> 55:57.580
while he was sleeping.

55:57.580 --> 55:58.780
Jesus.

55:58.780 --> 56:00.380
That was fun.

56:00.380 --> 56:02.780
Because it was just him in a room.

56:03.740 --> 56:05.640
You guys didn't double up or anything else.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.620
They were able to just slip in, grab him,

56:07.620 --> 56:09.740
return him afterwards.

56:09.740 --> 56:12.700
So that's why he died that horrible death at the end.

56:12.700 --> 56:15.980
Everyone else in town had some level of experimentation

56:15.980 --> 56:17.900
or they just lived in town long enough

56:17.900 --> 56:20.920
that they had ingested enough of this material

56:20.920 --> 56:23.500
that it was just all in their bloodstream and everywhere.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.640
Even if they didn't replace a particular organ,

56:25.640 --> 56:26.940
it was all inside of them.

56:26.940 --> 56:28.020
To make matters worse,

56:28.020 --> 56:30.220
once you have that much of it inside of you,

56:30.940 --> 56:31.900
so none of you except maybe Joe,

56:31.900 --> 56:33.680
but maybe still not even Joe,

56:33.680 --> 56:35.780
the aliens can see through your eyes,

56:35.780 --> 56:37.400
the aliens can control you,

56:37.400 --> 56:39.500
and they use it mostly for security.

56:39.500 --> 56:40.980
And they know who your crush is.

56:40.980 --> 56:41.980
Don't tell.

56:44.340 --> 56:45.340
They use it for security.

56:45.340 --> 56:47.060
So they're often controlling the sheriff,

56:47.060 --> 56:50.660
but they'll use other kind of senior people and stuff.

56:50.660 --> 56:52.380
That's why everyone was being so weird

56:52.380 --> 56:54.980
about people not being missing.

56:54.980 --> 56:56.860
Yeah, I was gonna ask,

56:56.860 --> 56:58.460
the people that we talked to,

56:58.460 --> 57:00.140
were they just like lying to us

57:01.020 --> 57:01.860
and they knew about the alien stuff

57:01.860 --> 57:03.020
or did they not have any clue?

57:03.020 --> 57:04.820
There's just too much of it in them already?

57:04.820 --> 57:06.740
It makes them like docile basically.

57:06.740 --> 57:08.460
There's a sidebar in it

57:08.460 --> 57:10.220
and it's called work, work, work, work.

57:10.220 --> 57:13.420
And basically everyone can just in their brain

57:13.420 --> 57:15.540
reason as to why people aren't around

57:15.540 --> 57:16.460
and it's totally fine.

57:16.460 --> 57:17.300
Like the mom is just like,

57:17.300 --> 57:19.020
yeah, my daughter, like she's cool.

57:19.020 --> 57:20.260
What, like why should I be worried?

57:20.260 --> 57:21.100
Yeah, that was really sad.

57:21.100 --> 57:22.140
Or my husband's like, I'm a cool mom.

57:22.140 --> 57:23.100
She's a cool kid.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.380
But yeah, that's one of the questions, I guess.

57:27.380 --> 57:30.520
What is the most popular menu item at Mega Deuce?

57:31.780 --> 57:33.980
Well, they have a couple of different things actually.

57:33.980 --> 57:35.980
And it's kind of a tier based system.

57:35.980 --> 57:37.920
There's the Single Deuce,

57:37.920 --> 57:42.920
which is a single cheeseburger and a small shake.

57:43.260 --> 57:44.660
The Double Deuce,

57:44.660 --> 57:47.660
which is a double cheeseburger with a medium shake.

57:47.660 --> 57:49.680
And then the Mega Deuce,

57:50.820 --> 57:53.940
which is eight patties.

57:53.940 --> 57:55.460
Yeah, it's like eight patties,

57:55.460 --> 57:56.980
extra large milkshake.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.060
And the slogan is, it's so good,

57:59.060 --> 58:01.220
it'll make you take a Mega Deuce.

58:01.220 --> 58:02.060
Wow.

58:02.060 --> 58:03.380
That is, it's a good slogan.

58:03.380 --> 58:05.420
David, you got me hungry.

58:05.420 --> 58:06.260
It's catchy.

58:06.260 --> 58:08.620
It's so much food, you'll shit a lot.

58:11.500 --> 58:14.980
And Merle, how is he the one who is in charge of it all?

58:16.420 --> 58:18.020
He really wasn't.

58:18.020 --> 58:19.020
He was not.

58:19.020 --> 58:22.380
He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.

58:22.380 --> 58:25.740
He was just an alderman, but all the alderman.

58:25.740 --> 58:26.700
Yeah, Alan Alda.

58:27.260 --> 58:29.620
He was played by Alan Alda, actually.

58:29.620 --> 58:31.380
We noticed that, yeah, but we did notice

58:31.380 --> 58:34.260
that it was all the alderman, we're all the men.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.780
And so we smashed the patriarchy tonight, boys.

58:36.780 --> 58:39.260
That's what we did, congratulations.

58:39.260 --> 58:40.660
And killed everyone else down there.

58:40.660 --> 58:42.580
Don't break the glass ceiling

58:42.580 --> 58:45.540
or David's dump is gonna pile all over us.

58:45.540 --> 58:50.540
Was, I assume, was Jane Allen pregnant with an alien baby?

58:51.340 --> 58:53.420
Nope, that was just a normal pregnant teenager

58:53.420 --> 58:54.240
that you murder.

58:54.240 --> 58:56.100
She would have died either way.

58:56.620 --> 58:58.020
They abducted Jane Allen.

58:58.020 --> 59:00.540
You didn't really go around spraying the purple stuff

59:00.540 --> 59:02.320
on her or on Joe, for that matter.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.460
You probably would have realized

59:03.460 --> 59:06.060
Joe was actually completely screwed

59:06.060 --> 59:10.620
had you sprayed it like a little more fully all over him.

59:10.620 --> 59:13.520
Yeah, stripped down and started like spraying your bodies.

59:13.520 --> 59:15.300
You would have seen the same incision marks

59:15.300 --> 59:17.220
kind of on Billy Ray's arms.

59:17.220 --> 59:20.220
Oh shit, the one person whose arms we didn't look at.

59:22.260 --> 59:25.200
She was just recently pregnant with Billy Ray

59:25.240 --> 59:28.160
about a week before he went on his crime spree.

59:28.160 --> 59:30.240
She didn't even know, she was abducted.

59:30.240 --> 59:34.160
They took out her uterus with the baby,

59:34.160 --> 59:37.320
gave her this, it's called proto-matter, the goo,

59:37.320 --> 59:39.600
then put something, you don't know.

59:39.600 --> 59:42.280
So it's every single person in Grover'sville

59:42.280 --> 59:44.880
like coughed and died slowly?

59:44.880 --> 59:45.720
Yeah.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.000
Can you choose like one child out of the town

59:48.000 --> 59:49.820
and describe that in detail for us?

59:51.720 --> 59:53.660
Well, I can tell you about,

59:53.660 --> 59:55.380
so a lot of people had experiments, right?

59:55.380 --> 59:58.820
So the little kids that you met at the reservoir

59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.580
that were pounding seven and a half pieces a piece,

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.740
they had work done on their livers.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.020
They had super livers.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.420
Oh wow.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:09.820
As these aliens know how to party.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.020
David, thank you so much for running this game for us.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.500
This was such a blast and thank you for sticking around

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.100
for this extended episode.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:21.420
All five weeks, yeah, we really appreciate it, man.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.020
We're gonna open the cage now.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.140
I wanted to get it to some sort of a conclusion

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:29.300
because we could have just thoroughly harassed

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.860
citizens for presumably.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.700
So many more.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.180
If we didn't even touch the bowling alley,

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.020
we could have like.

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:36.880
Have you ever run this before?

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.720
No, not at all.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.320
I prepped this exclusively for this,

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.500
largely because Zach gave me very few options

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.140
as far as things he has not looked at before.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:46.960
That's my way.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.800
I liked it.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.480
I mean, this is a shorter scenario.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.220
It's only like a dozen pages.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.020
It's something you could hypothetically do

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:57.580
with efficient players who stay on track for things.

01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:01.860
In under four hours at a con.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.740
David, those are, that's just an urban legend.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.340
Oh, those players don't exist.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.740
I think they just play different games, maybe.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.940
But no, thank you very much for having me.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.260
This was a fun crossover event.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.900
Like I said, I love you guys' stuff.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.040
Yeah, the pleasure was all ours, completely.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.480
Thank you for all of this.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.160
Thanks for everyone, I guess, who listened

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.920
and put up with me for the last five episodes.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.200
Blessed with your presence.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.820
Those people who know me from elsewhere,

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.000
who followed along,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.580
hopefully I haven't totally ruined

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.400
Delta Green for you either.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.600
That would be on us, so you're in the clear.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.600
But if you like that nonsense,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.980
go to episode one of Pretending to be People

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:45.780
and go ahead and start down that long path.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.600
You've got plenty to catch up on.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.760
You can see where they cut their teeth

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.480
by harassing random civilians.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.520
Yep, it's kind of our trademark.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.160
Just authority figures abusing that power

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.920
for petty reasons and little gain.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.720
It's an all lawful evil campaign.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.280
Okay, well, David, we're gonna open the cage now.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.360
Yeah, you are free to go.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.000
Creak!

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.160
Oh, wow, he really took off.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.000
He's scampering.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:16.820
He's scampering.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.660
Oh, wow.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.500
When I make a scamper, that's what I think of.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.940
There's a little dust trail.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.780
His calves are good.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.100
He did not want to be here.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.020
I can't get high.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.440
I can't get high.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.700
I thought this stuff helped anxiety.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.140
It must be something inside of me.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.140
Does anybody know why?

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.100
I don't know why.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:07.100
I can't get high.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.580
I can't get high.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:17.580
I can't see through, I can't, and I don't wanna try.

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:23.580
Please, my smile, won't you spare me something?

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:27.580
Where can you buy it?

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:36.580
Where do you begin when you don't know how?

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:45.580
Hallucinations held big time by spiders out the line.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:53.580
Breathing in, breathing out.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.580
I've been hiding in low, low places

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.580
with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:06.580
And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:31.580
I think I'm allergic or something.

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:38.580
Better go on with nothing so I won't get high.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:44.580
No, I won't get high.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.580
By all means, do it if it helps.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.580
For me, it makes my brain melt easy.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.580
Does anybody know why?

01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:01.580
I can't get high.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:09.580
I can't see through, I can't, and I don't wanna try.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.580
Please, my smile, won't you spare me something?

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.580
Where can you buy it?

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:27.580
Where do you begin when you don't know how?

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:36.580
Hallucinations held big time by spiders out the line.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:44.580
Breathing in, breathing out.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:48.580
I've been hiding in low, low places

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.580
with some funny looking dudes with some fucked up faces.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:58.580
And I can't help the feeling I'll always be at the bottom.

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.580
Thank you for watching.
