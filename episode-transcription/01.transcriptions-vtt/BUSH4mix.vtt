00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Well, how do you do, pupparoos?

00:03.040 --> 00:06.760
It's your grown-ass pup mother, Wolf the dog.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.240
And I am here to provide nourishment for your wittle ears.

00:11.240 --> 00:14.040
It's also live, I'm told.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.840
From 694.2 PTBP, maybe.

00:17.840 --> 00:21.440
The only radio station that can broadcast

00:21.440 --> 00:24.700
in multiple dimensions, probably.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.400
But what I'm rock solid for sure about

00:27.440 --> 00:30.520
is the fact that we got a new Howlin' with Wolf,

00:30.520 --> 00:33.820
everyone named Wolf's favorite segment.

00:33.820 --> 00:35.800
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from

00:35.800 --> 00:37.840
Nick with Everything's a Mimic,

00:37.840 --> 00:41.080
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod,

00:41.080 --> 00:45.880
which is, whoa, something you can do too, dear listener.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.520
So cool of you, wow.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.360
Nick with Everything's a Mimic writes,

00:51.360 --> 00:56.160
hello, Mr. Dog, long-time listener, first-time writer.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.520
Normally, I would take this opportunity

00:58.520 --> 01:02.560
to shout out the actual play podcast, Everything's a Mimic,

01:02.560 --> 01:07.560
and our players, Ryan D, Ryan B, Chris, Cody, and Andy.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.080
Normally, this would also be the perfect time

01:11.080 --> 01:15.000
to shout out our website, Everything's a Mimic dot com.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.640
But now is just not that time,

01:17.640 --> 01:20.080
for I have seen the yellow sign.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.480
Its insignia dances carelessly and purposely

01:23.480 --> 01:26.780
in and out of the black void of our empty vessels

01:26.780 --> 01:30.280
like the ebb and flow of the ocean's embrace.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.880
The pallid mask seeks all who are willing,

01:33.880 --> 01:36.960
and, oh shit, I ran out of characters.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.320
Love you, PTBP boys.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.380
Thanks for the love, Nick with Everything's a Mimic.

01:43.380 --> 01:46.460
Can anyone who knows what the fuck a podcast is

01:46.460 --> 01:48.960
tell me what an actual play is?

01:48.960 --> 01:52.300
Do they actually do things?

01:52.300 --> 01:55.980
Or do they imaginarily do things?

01:55.980 --> 02:00.060
Is an actual play like a real Shakespeare?

02:00.060 --> 02:03.860
I'm so confused by the internet and all it beholds.

02:03.860 --> 02:07.520
One day, when I remember my AOL password,

02:07.520 --> 02:10.660
I'll get to get back on there and see what's poppin'.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.060
If you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

02:13.060 --> 02:16.340
tag at PretendingPod on the internets.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.460
Or don't, what do I care?

02:18.460 --> 02:21.580
Though I will say it warms my producer's bones

02:21.580 --> 02:25.220
every time he sees kind words written about pretending

02:25.220 --> 02:28.400
to be people out there on the damn internet.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.600
So if you wanna positively impact my producer's day,

02:32.600 --> 02:35.860
and maybe write some words for wolf to say,

02:35.860 --> 02:39.660
tag at PretendingPod and check out this segue.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.460
One gave me a bruise, the other gave me the blues.

02:43.460 --> 02:48.140
The first part's a segue, and next it's the news.

02:48.140 --> 02:52.260
The boy on the table, Carl Lambert's long-lost brother,

02:52.260 --> 02:55.740
who somehow hasn't aged in three decades,

02:55.740 --> 02:57.820
seems to have been bitten by something

02:57.820 --> 02:59.780
that looks a bit like a tick.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.140
But it's got more than eight legs,

03:02.140 --> 03:04.820
and last I recall, ticks can't normally

03:04.820 --> 03:07.420
phase through matter, like if they wanted

03:07.420 --> 03:10.200
to get into Doreen Morreen's boot

03:10.200 --> 03:13.540
just by pullin' some kind of Hayden Christensen

03:13.540 --> 03:15.380
and Jumper nonsense.

03:15.380 --> 03:19.100
But this here is, indeed, some Jake Gyllenhaal

03:19.100 --> 03:21.300
crawlin' around with Danny DeVito

03:21.300 --> 03:25.340
while chasin' car crashes in his blue kinda stuff.

03:25.340 --> 03:28.180
The Chuckster hollowed for Agent Morreen

03:28.180 --> 03:30.880
to pour some of the potion out of the cauldron

03:30.880 --> 03:33.740
and into her boot, which she promptly did.

03:33.740 --> 03:37.920
Hopefully, luckily, this elixir was exceptionally brewed

03:37.920 --> 03:42.860
by Dr. Rusty Hooch, all while Dr. Olivia Miller

03:42.860 --> 03:45.220
just stared at the rash around the bite

03:46.100 --> 03:49.180
on the unnaturally young boy's bruised and bloodied chest.

03:49.180 --> 03:53.820
The rash rippled like waves from the terrible epicenter,

03:53.820 --> 03:56.380
and the flushed bumps formed a target

03:56.380 --> 03:59.140
on the most recent victim's body.

03:59.140 --> 04:03.140
Unrelated, here's Molly Healy with Circles.

04:03.140 --> 04:08.140
["Circles of Death"]

04:33.140 --> 04:38.140
["Circles of Death"]

04:40.980 --> 04:42.740
So I was writing down secret things

04:42.740 --> 04:45.900
that I'm not allowed to see, but it's in my eye line.

04:45.900 --> 04:46.820
That's like when people are like,

04:46.820 --> 04:48.580
"'Don't look at my cards,"

04:48.580 --> 04:50.660
and they're like showing you their cards.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.620
It's like, it's not my decision,

04:52.620 --> 04:54.300
my mental decision to look at your cards,

04:54.300 --> 04:56.900
but physically, my body will turn towards your cards.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.020
Yeah, like guess what, bitch?

04:58.020 --> 05:01.800
God helps those who help themselves, so hide it.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.600
Oh my God, I love God.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.600
["Circles of Death"]

05:10.100 --> 05:15.100
["In the Arms of the Angel"]

05:17.200 --> 05:19.000
You know when you're just like loving God?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.160
Sarah McLachlan.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.240
All right, Ellie.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.080
I, uh.

05:24.080 --> 05:24.920
All right.

05:26.920 --> 05:27.760
You first.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.160
Did you open your email, Zach?

05:30.160 --> 05:31.520
Oh God, what?

05:32.720 --> 05:35.200
I don't know if it's linked to your email, though.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.400
It might not be, nevermind.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.440
Eleanor Tilleranzo just became a patron

05:39.440 --> 05:44.440
of pretending to be people at one of the coolest tiers.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
420?

05:46.480 --> 05:50.120
No, 420 a month would be a hell of a Patreon tier.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.460
She's at the $6.66 level.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.960
Yeah, hell yeah.

05:54.960 --> 05:59.060
You can be a patron at the $5 level

05:59.060 --> 06:01.480
at patreon.com slash pretending pod,

06:02.080 --> 06:05.920
and you can get all of our bonus audio content there,

06:05.920 --> 06:08.120
including full episodes of full Delta Green

06:08.120 --> 06:11.040
like home brew campaign that I ran for the boys,

06:11.040 --> 06:15.560
and you can have Taylor's phone call fully sound

06:15.560 --> 06:17.300
as your ringtone.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.140
Ring, ring.

06:18.140 --> 06:18.980
It's on.

06:18.980 --> 06:19.800
Ring, ring.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.480
But I think Chuck's version of it would be like,

06:21.480 --> 06:25.680
bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.720
Bring it, bro.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.560
All right, but Eleanor signed up

06:29.560 --> 06:34.200
at the much cooler $6.66 level,

06:34.200 --> 06:38.120
which is all the exact same rewards.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.820
It's just a cooler number.

06:39.820 --> 06:44.820
Yeah, and I wanna be cool.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.600
So far, so good.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.660
Right, right, right?

06:48.660 --> 06:51.660
No, I was never cool, but I was cold.

06:51.660 --> 06:53.080
My heart is dead.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.720
No, I'm kidding.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.220
What were you like in school?

06:57.220 --> 06:59.080
I was a slut, to be honest.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
If you guys haven't figured it out,

07:00.520 --> 07:04.780
but I was totally, at least by American standards.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.240
But I wasn't judged for it, which was great.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.080
Oh, that's great.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.260
That's nice.

07:10.260 --> 07:15.260
I was fondling the D and the P all up in high school,

07:15.760 --> 07:17.200
but no one really judged me for it.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.760
Wait, what's the difference between the D and the P?

07:19.760 --> 07:23.880
One is a hole and one is like a thing

07:23.880 --> 07:26.760
that really shoves things into a hole.

07:26.760 --> 07:30.360
Wait, what are you putting in between the penis

07:30.360 --> 07:31.920
and the vagina to have sex?

07:31.920 --> 07:32.760
I get it.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.600
You shoving something in?

07:33.600 --> 07:36.480
No, no, the P stands for, okay,

07:36.480 --> 07:39.880
the P stands for pussy, pussy.

07:39.880 --> 07:40.720
I thought you were like,

07:40.720 --> 07:42.520
I'm playing with dicks and penises,

07:42.520 --> 07:46.660
and I'm like, I don't wanna discredit your sluttiness,

07:46.660 --> 07:48.440
but that's the same damn thing.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.480
Yeah, you would also be like,

07:50.480 --> 07:51.920
that's when you find out I was lying.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.240
I'm like, I was playing with something called the dick

07:54.240 --> 07:58.460
and I'm the penis with my vagina.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.480
I stuck my vagina inside his penis.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.760
That's how you do it, right?

08:05.760 --> 08:06.680
And then I got pregnant.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.520
No, I didn't.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.040
That was a lot later.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.760
Pretending to be teen pregnant.

08:16.020 --> 08:19.080
You're like, Junie's actually 10 years old.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.280
I know she's just developing a little slower.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.680
Swedish babies take a little longer to cook.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.800
We're like elves, 3,000 years old,

08:28.800 --> 08:30.940
but it's like, oh, or baby Yoda.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.480
Spoilers.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.160
Spoilers, baby Yoda exists.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.920
Yo, are you watching Boba Fett?

08:41.920 --> 08:43.080
So here's the thing, Zach,

08:43.080 --> 08:44.280
when you become a parent,

08:44.280 --> 08:48.320
you have to basically choose your form of entertainment

08:48.320 --> 08:51.200
because you have 10 minutes a day, maybe.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.760
And I've put mine into Yellowstone, great show,

08:55.760 --> 08:58.280
in case you guys haven't checked it out

08:58.280 --> 09:01.800
because I'm super into Western awful people, apparently.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.400
So that's who I like to watch.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.080
Hell yeah, that rules.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.280
I don't know what, I was just gonna talk about

09:08.280 --> 09:12.080
how Thundercat is the cameo in the last episode

09:12.080 --> 09:13.580
of Boba Fett and it made me so happy.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.840
He's a bass player who's fucking awesome.

09:15.840 --> 09:16.680
He's like-

09:16.680 --> 09:17.500
Wait.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.020
Thundercat, like the Thundercats, like the lion?

09:23.300 --> 09:25.540
No, that would be so fucking rad.

09:25.540 --> 09:28.540
No, it's a very cool musician

09:28.540 --> 09:31.180
who Taylor is singing Dragon Ball Durag right now,

09:31.180 --> 09:32.780
which is a bop.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.060
Such a fun song.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.260
Such a good song.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.340
He's such a cool guy.

09:36.340 --> 09:38.540
He like wears like-

09:38.540 --> 09:43.540
It's like kimono print boxers that are like silky.

09:43.780 --> 09:47.580
Dragon Ball Z embroidered logo on them.

09:47.580 --> 09:50.900
It's like, he's a nerd and he's sexy

09:50.900 --> 09:54.360
and he makes dope music and he's in Star Wars now.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.100
So he's my hero.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.620
Wait, Boba Fett is Star Wars?

09:59.620 --> 10:00.460
Oh my God.

10:00.460 --> 10:04.100
Yeah, Boba Fett is the assassin, right?

10:04.100 --> 10:08.460
Like he's a hired, to me, the clone's out of him.

10:08.460 --> 10:12.780
All right, midichlorians, let's dive into the-

10:13.020 --> 10:15.060
The fourth episode of-

10:18.940 --> 10:22.380
Live long and may the peace be on upon you.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.180
Give you peace as you sleep and may you know

10:25.180 --> 10:28.900
that the Lord, your God, loves you very, very much.

10:28.900 --> 10:31.340
That is what my parents said to me every night

10:31.340 --> 10:34.020
before I went to sleep and dreamed about demons.

10:34.020 --> 10:34.860
Let's go.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.020
So much to unpack.

10:39.020 --> 10:39.860
So much to unpack.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.500
Oh yeah, we all have religious trauma in this house.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.700
Really, I need to know so much because I'm such an atheist.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.340
Oh shit.

10:48.340 --> 10:51.380
Raise your hand if you've spoken in tongues at this table.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.220
What?

10:52.220 --> 10:55.060
Yeah, that's two of us who acted like we were communicating

10:55.060 --> 10:58.820
with the other side and no one thought it was cool.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.420
It was like we were wearing khakis when we did it.

11:01.420 --> 11:06.260
Like it wasn't fucking rad, it was lame and it's also cool.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.500
I don't know, the church should lean into metal imagery

11:09.500 --> 11:11.460
and I'd be way more into it.

11:12.340 --> 11:15.700
All right, let's actually, let's play a game.

11:15.700 --> 11:20.300
I like a bit of chitchat, but I'm very interested

11:20.300 --> 11:22.940
to see what happens next and I have to know.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.340
So let's get into this.

11:24.340 --> 11:25.380
Well, it's like it's your choice.

11:25.380 --> 11:29.460
You're either gonna let my cool ass boot move work

11:29.460 --> 11:33.700
or Doreen, I guess, I don't know, loses a foot.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.380
I don't know what's happening.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.800
I do.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.860
I have a sense, unfortunately, of what's about to happen.

11:39.860 --> 11:40.700
Oh, unfortunately.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.020
You know what, Zach?

11:42.020 --> 11:43.380
I'll just take over from here.

11:43.380 --> 11:44.340
Okay, sounds good.

11:44.340 --> 11:49.340
Okay, so a little bit of meta game,

11:52.980 --> 11:54.580
outside of the game knowledge,

11:54.580 --> 11:57.220
just because it might be good to know this.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.820
Okay, sometimes I just try to talk

12:00.820 --> 12:04.140
and the thing I say is dumb and stupid, so.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.980
Zach, I'm gonna need you to roll sanity for me.

12:05.980 --> 12:08.540
Oh, that happens to me all the time.

12:08.540 --> 12:11.940
I've had a new catchphrase around the house recently

12:11.940 --> 12:13.820
when Taylor's like, what did you just say?

12:13.820 --> 12:16.100
I say, I'm allowed to say stupid things.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.420
He's been saying it so often.

12:18.420 --> 12:21.060
I've been saying a lot of stupid shit recently.

12:21.060 --> 12:22.380
You're not allowed to divorce me

12:22.380 --> 12:23.620
because I say stupid things.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.620
Just because I'm an idiot

12:24.620 --> 12:26.500
doesn't mean you should love me any less.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.740
He blamed COVID quite a bit.

12:28.740 --> 12:29.580
Yeah.

12:29.580 --> 12:30.620
Apparently COVID makes you dumber.

12:30.620 --> 12:33.100
Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot now.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.620
When I was pregnant, I blamed it all the time.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.460
I'm like, guys, it's the pregnancy brain,

12:36.460 --> 12:37.820
you know, it's the mom brain.

12:37.940 --> 12:40.020
And so every time I say something dumb,

12:40.020 --> 12:41.420
it's what I blame.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.580
But one day you realize it's all a lie, Zach.

12:44.580 --> 12:45.420
I know.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.580
You're just stupid.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.580
Well, I'd been doing dry January

12:49.580 --> 12:51.700
and so previously I was like,

12:51.700 --> 12:53.380
it's just cause I'm high all the time.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.820
But apparently, no, it's not.

12:55.820 --> 12:56.660
So I-

12:56.660 --> 12:58.220
Oh wait, for dry January,

12:58.220 --> 12:59.740
you're not allowed to smoke either?

12:59.740 --> 13:02.020
Well, that's what I gave a go.

13:02.020 --> 13:02.860
Zach set rules.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.700
You're doing sober January.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.060
He's doing fully clear mind January.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.900
Until last night and I'm-

13:09.780 --> 13:12.340
All right, but I'll get back.

13:12.340 --> 13:14.980
I'll get back on for the rest of the month.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.180
How about that?

13:16.180 --> 13:18.660
Taylor gave me a look like, really, motherfucker?

13:18.660 --> 13:20.180
Well, last night he's like, I think I'm done.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.500
I think January is over.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.420
It's February negative 11th.

13:26.580 --> 13:27.420
Yep.

13:28.460 --> 13:29.540
Amazing.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.580
February, the shittiest month.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.180
Like it always gets treated so poorly.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.020
It's like you get 28 days

13:36.020 --> 13:37.500
and now minus 11.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.060
The 39 days of February.

13:42.060 --> 13:43.620
All right, let's-

13:43.620 --> 13:46.420
On the negative 10th day of February,

13:46.420 --> 13:47.260
I drink a beer.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.780
God fucking scared.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.580
All right, let us begin.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.420
He can't decide if he's going to let my cool thing happen.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.900
Have faith.

14:01.900 --> 14:05.060
George Michael this situation and let's get into it.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.660
We were in dexterity order.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.100
It was during Marine's turn.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.820
Now it is Dr. Miller's turn.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.540
Oh no, I hate, wait.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.540
Right at the top of the episode.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.980
Yeah, fuck, man.

14:17.740 --> 14:21.660
Okay, so just like a brief little thing,

14:21.660 --> 14:23.100
what was summary of what happened.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.180
Eleanor, that's a really good point.

14:25.180 --> 14:28.380
Let's give a quick rundown of everything that happened

14:28.380 --> 14:29.620
in each of your introductions.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.460
No, I'm just kidding.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.700
So you guys got here,

14:32.740 --> 14:35.740
you got your hazmat suits on ready to go.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.220
They came out with the camera to shoot a Bush video.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.380
You told them, hey, I'm not here to be on camera

14:40.380 --> 14:41.900
until I know this shit is real.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.180
Let's get inside.

14:43.180 --> 14:46.180
As you get inside, you all see not the body of a Bigfoot,

14:46.180 --> 14:51.180
but rather the blues and bruddy body of a 12 year old boy

14:51.660 --> 14:55.180
who is just filled with bullet holes from a 12 gauge.

14:55.180 --> 14:58.540
And there's just blood everywhere pouring onto this tarp

14:58.540 --> 15:01.420
that he's laying on, which is on a pool table.

15:01.420 --> 15:05.740
Carl yells out for his younger brother, Michael,

15:05.740 --> 15:08.180
and he's just begins weeping and weeping.

15:08.180 --> 15:12.140
Michael, his brother who disappeared at age 12,

15:12.140 --> 15:15.940
Carl and his dad both said that Bigfoot had abducted

15:15.940 --> 15:16.780
this boy.

15:16.780 --> 15:20.020
That's what they remember happening in their minds.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.340
That's how they must've explained it to themselves

15:23.340 --> 15:25.620
to try to explain it to other people.

15:25.620 --> 15:29.100
And so now everyone's kind of running around.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.980
Dr. Miller's looking at the body.

15:30.980 --> 15:35.420
Doreen Marine has grabbed this substance, this potion,

15:35.420 --> 15:37.100
if you will, that's in a tiny cauldron

15:37.100 --> 15:38.620
for some goddamn reason.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.580
And then she's pouring it into her boot because Charles,

15:45.580 --> 15:49.700
the Chuckster has screamed that she needs to pour this

15:49.700 --> 15:50.780
into her boot.

15:50.780 --> 15:54.820
Not knowing what's actually in this potion

15:54.820 --> 15:57.460
could just be acid that melts her entire fucking foot off.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.740
I mean, whatever you gotta do.

15:59.740 --> 16:02.140
Dr. Hooch is the one who's created

16:02.140 --> 16:06.260
this pharmaceutical remedy with a critical success

16:06.260 --> 16:07.740
while in the lab.

16:07.740 --> 16:11.580
Janice is on the ground underneath Charles, the Chuckster,

16:11.580 --> 16:14.380
who has just disarmed her and is keeping her.

16:14.380 --> 16:18.220
I feel like you're kind of like on her back a little bit.

16:18.220 --> 16:22.340
Yeah, I've got my knee down kind of over her.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.660
Riding her like a pony.

16:23.660 --> 16:24.500
Absolutely.

16:25.060 --> 16:29.140
That's some genuine Chuckster moves right there.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.540
Jump on it.

16:30.540 --> 16:34.420
I'm doing like a little lasso, fake lasso spin.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.420
Janice.

16:37.180 --> 16:42.180
And Carl and Jerome are kind of in this weird back and forth

16:42.340 --> 16:45.740
where Carl keeps rolling fails on his sanity

16:45.740 --> 16:46.940
to kind of get upset,

16:46.940 --> 16:49.860
but Jerome keeps rolling really well to calm him down

16:49.860 --> 16:51.500
and they're fucking homies.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.460
And you can tell guys, as you're looking at the two of them,

16:54.460 --> 16:57.620
their bond seems to be unshakable.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.660
These two dudes have lived life together

16:59.660 --> 17:01.020
for the past three years.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.100
Honestly, it's cool to see men of this age

17:04.100 --> 17:06.100
being so emotionally full.

17:07.540 --> 17:10.340
Yeah, fucking gay man.

17:10.340 --> 17:12.060
And this is why it's hard for,

17:12.060 --> 17:14.740
yeah, it's hard to be a man in 2018.

17:14.740 --> 17:16.580
Yeah.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.140
Woe is the white man.

17:18.980 --> 17:19.820
Yeah.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.620
Cause Ali's always calling me gay.

17:25.260 --> 17:26.860
I'm such a bully.

17:26.860 --> 17:29.620
Yeah, wait, that's bullying to call me gay, Ali?

17:29.620 --> 17:31.340
Yeah, because being gay is so bad.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.180
Oh no.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.780
Quick reminder for the audience.

17:36.780 --> 17:37.900
Gays suck.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.460
Oh my God.

17:39.460 --> 17:41.060
Double down.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.860
I prefer calling him weak, emotionally weak.

17:48.620 --> 17:49.540
Holy shit.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.500
I'm rubber, you're glue.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.820
You like pussy and I like you.

17:59.980 --> 18:01.700
We talked about that last episode.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.420
What if you guys found out I'm super homophobic

18:04.420 --> 18:06.220
or something awesomely awful?

18:06.220 --> 18:08.060
Right in the middle of the fourth episode,

18:08.060 --> 18:11.420
you're a bigot and we're like, what the fuck?

18:11.420 --> 18:13.220
Yeah, no, but honestly guys.

18:13.220 --> 18:18.220
I can't wait to leave a review on how I was treated

18:18.380 --> 18:19.220
on this podcast.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.820
I think we're now, we stayed very on track

18:25.820 --> 18:28.340
with the rundown of what's happened so far.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.860
And I think that probably gave Dr. Miller enough time

18:31.860 --> 18:35.420
to figure out exactly what she's doing

18:35.420 --> 18:37.380
with this first turn of her round.

18:37.380 --> 18:38.220
What is that?

18:38.220 --> 18:40.100
I've been trying to, I've been trying to catch

18:40.140 --> 18:43.820
this little tick for the past 60 rounds.

18:43.820 --> 18:47.660
So I think if she can see it now, can she see it now?

18:47.660 --> 18:48.660
Can we all see it?

18:48.660 --> 18:49.500
Nope.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.540
Does she know that it went in the boot?

18:51.540 --> 18:52.380
It does not.

18:52.380 --> 18:53.260
Oh, it already went into the boot.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.620
Oh shit.

18:54.620 --> 18:55.460
Then.

18:55.460 --> 18:56.860
Oh, I'm sorry, fuck.

18:56.860 --> 18:57.940
I mean, you should have all assumed

18:57.940 --> 19:00.740
because I had her pour a potion down in her boot.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.620
Yeah, you could maybe yell something in character right now

19:03.620 --> 19:05.820
for just the story to make sense, I guess,

19:05.820 --> 19:06.660
maybe a little bit.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.980
It's the alien bomb.

19:10.140 --> 19:10.980
Bug.

19:11.980 --> 19:12.820
Where is it?

19:12.820 --> 19:13.820
In the boot.

19:17.100 --> 19:17.940
Okay.

19:18.820 --> 19:20.140
I don't know why.

19:22.140 --> 19:24.860
It's the alien bug in the boot, all right.

19:24.860 --> 19:25.980
It's the alien bug in the boot.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.380
It's the alien bug in the boot.

19:27.380 --> 19:28.580
It's the alien bug, it's the alien bug,

19:28.580 --> 19:29.420
it's the alien bug in the boot.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.700
So Dr. Miller, she sees Doreen Morin

19:32.700 --> 19:36.380
pouring the liquid into her boot and she's like, oh no.

19:36.380 --> 19:39.300
And so she hurries over and I think tries

19:39.300 --> 19:42.700
to get the boot off of Dr. Morin.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.540
I'm sorry, Dr. Morin.

19:43.540 --> 19:44.860
Morin, Doreen.

19:44.860 --> 19:45.700
You've been upgraded.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.620
You upgraded, yeah.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.460
You're a doctor now, we're all a doctor.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.300
Look at me.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.740
I guess technically we're supposed to all be doctors.

19:53.740 --> 19:54.580
I think we're all.

19:54.580 --> 19:55.420
I'm a doctor, you're a doctor.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.260
Oh right, med students.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.300
We are all supposed to be.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.740
Oh, that's right.

19:58.740 --> 19:59.580
She says, doctor.

19:59.580 --> 20:00.420
Yes, doctor.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.260
Get your boot off, doctor.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.080
Take your clothes off.

20:02.080 --> 20:02.920
Okay, doctor.

20:02.920 --> 20:03.740
Take your clothes off.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.620
I strip naked.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.180
Yeah, not those clothes.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.780
Okay, down to her boots.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.100
Hey, quick question, Zach.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.740
How does it get in the boot if she has a hazmat suit on?

20:15.740 --> 20:17.940
You don't know that it went in the boot.

20:17.940 --> 20:20.740
The thing that I told you when no one else was listening.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.220
Wow, you are the Luke of this group.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.060
Jesus Christ.

20:28.420 --> 20:29.660
Do we need to take our?

20:29.660 --> 20:30.580
Oh yeah.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.660
I remember how it got in the boot.

20:32.660 --> 20:35.140
If it even is in the boot, you know.

20:35.140 --> 20:35.980
That's a good point.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.140
That's a good point.

20:38.140 --> 20:41.980
Okay, Dr. Miller runs forward to Maureen

20:41.980 --> 20:44.660
and tries to like, is it in the boot?

20:44.660 --> 20:45.500
Is it in the boot?

20:45.500 --> 20:48.780
And then she's panically trying to get the boot off

20:48.780 --> 20:51.480
and try to find this thing.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.620
I like to think that Doreen Maureen loves her military boots

20:54.620 --> 20:56.880
so goddamn much that she took them off

20:56.880 --> 21:00.060
to put on the hazmat suit and then put the boots on

21:00.060 --> 21:02.580
over the bottoms of the hazmat suit,

21:02.580 --> 21:05.460
which is how she was able to pour this liquid

21:05.900 --> 21:08.620
down into the boots while still wearing the hazmat suit.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.060
Done, he's in the hazmat suit.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.380
It's still over my foot.

21:11.380 --> 21:12.220
Let's be clear about that.

21:12.220 --> 21:13.940
Yeah, oh, it's definitely still over your foot.

21:13.940 --> 21:18.420
And so Dr. Miller helps you remove the boot.

21:18.420 --> 21:19.260
Okay.

21:19.260 --> 21:20.700
Yeah, you take the boot off, you look inside,

21:20.700 --> 21:22.060
you don't see anything.

21:22.060 --> 21:25.040
Sick, where the fuck is it?

21:25.040 --> 21:25.880
Yes.

21:26.980 --> 21:29.260
You scream and Janice Ruth looks up

21:29.260 --> 21:31.940
and she's like, what, where's what?

21:31.940 --> 21:34.500
As she's being straddled by the truckster.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.820
Where's what, what are you guys talking about?

21:36.820 --> 21:40.260
And Jerome is like, wait, you said alien bug?

21:40.260 --> 21:41.840
The fuck is going on?

21:41.840 --> 21:43.260
What do you know?

21:43.260 --> 21:46.540
They're cool, it's cool, they're cool, you can tell them.

21:46.540 --> 21:49.420
All right, based on the stretch marks

21:49.420 --> 21:51.540
on this poor boy over here,

21:51.540 --> 21:54.060
I have reason to believe that it used to be something

21:54.060 --> 21:55.620
that it's not anymore.

21:55.620 --> 21:59.340
And what we saw was a tick running away from it.

21:59.340 --> 22:02.420
And I can only assume tick tend to be only feeding off

22:02.620 --> 22:04.780
organic live material.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.820
If this boy has been dead for a while,

22:06.820 --> 22:09.420
as I understand, several decades,

22:09.420 --> 22:10.780
this doesn't make any sense.

22:10.780 --> 22:12.740
So we need to find this tick.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.980
So basically Dr. Miller reveals everything

22:14.980 --> 22:16.340
she heard in private.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.180
And then Chuck yells,

22:18.180 --> 22:19.940
where, ticker, where, where, where.

22:19.940 --> 22:20.980
Sorry, that's how I get into character.

22:20.980 --> 22:21.820
Totally.

22:23.100 --> 22:26.140
This isn't no normal tick though, bro.

22:26.140 --> 22:29.900
This tick is like jumpy in time and space

22:29.900 --> 22:31.500
and like versus there and then it's there

22:31.540 --> 22:33.860
and then it's there and then guess what, what?

22:33.860 --> 22:35.300
Where is it?

22:35.300 --> 22:36.700
Is that true?

22:36.700 --> 22:37.540
Is that true?

22:37.540 --> 22:39.540
Then we can all be infected right now.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.220
All I'm saying is that's what I saw, dude.

22:42.220 --> 22:46.660
Everybody roll sanity, helplessness.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.060
This is called helplessness.

22:49.060 --> 22:49.900
Jesus.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.220
You feel helpless and it's a ness.

22:52.220 --> 22:53.060
Super fail.

22:53.060 --> 22:53.900
11.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.180
Not Loch Ness, it's just Bigfoot.

22:55.180 --> 22:56.020
What?

22:56.020 --> 22:58.180
78 on a 34.

22:58.180 --> 23:00.420
A fail, lose one sanity.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.780
I also failed 91 on a 54.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.100
Lose one sanity.

23:04.100 --> 23:05.820
11 on a 59.

23:05.820 --> 23:08.060
Nice, critical success.

23:08.060 --> 23:09.860
You gain sanity.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.540
I gain sanity and I don't even know

23:11.540 --> 23:13.740
if this tick is in my hazmat suit right now.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.540
Critical success.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.500
You're able to keep your head very much on your shoulders

23:19.500 --> 23:22.420
and we'll go to Eleanor real quick for her sanity.

23:22.420 --> 23:23.780
39 on a 55.

23:23.780 --> 23:27.580
Congratulations, zero sanity lost in this situation.

23:27.620 --> 23:32.100
You too will be able to act with a cutting edge movement.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.140
You too, the edge.

23:34.140 --> 23:37.300
All right, so shit.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.740
Lindsay, because you critically succeeded

23:42.740 --> 23:44.140
on your sanity check,

23:44.140 --> 23:46.980
I am going to give you some information

23:46.980 --> 23:49.140
that nobody else can hear.

23:49.140 --> 23:54.140
So take off your headphones, wiggle your ears.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.140
Hey, Ally, maybe don't fucking put your fingers

23:57.140 --> 23:58.900
in your ears this time.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.740
They can go on the outside.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.100
Guys, it's been a joke from the beginning.

24:04.220 --> 24:06.580
We don't do bits on this podcast, Ally.

24:07.900 --> 24:08.940
Lindsay.

24:08.940 --> 24:11.420
Yes, that's Doreen.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.620
Doreen feels a bite on her foot.

24:14.940 --> 24:19.060
Because you're clear and present in this situation,

24:19.060 --> 24:22.020
it's very, very apparent to you

24:22.020 --> 24:25.860
that underneath the hazmat suit, you've been bitten.

24:26.860 --> 24:30.100
You know the feeling when you like see a bug

24:30.100 --> 24:32.420
and then your skin starts to fucking crawl,

24:32.420 --> 24:34.180
like you think that they're on you?

24:35.180 --> 24:38.700
You feel that feeling all over your entire body.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.620
Because you critically succeeded on your sanity,

24:41.620 --> 24:43.300
I'm not gonna have your sanity again.

24:43.300 --> 24:44.980
So you're gonna be able to have your wits about you

24:44.980 --> 24:46.100
in this situation.

24:46.100 --> 24:49.020
Stay calm, take care of it.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.740
Can I just cut, just chop?

24:52.740 --> 24:54.860
Can I just chop that bad boy off?

24:55.900 --> 24:57.740
You can do whatever you would like to do.

24:57.740 --> 24:58.940
I'm gonna get them back.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.340
If that's your first instinct,

25:00.340 --> 25:03.060
there's definitely a hatchet on the wall.

25:03.060 --> 25:07.300
Like this is a barn slash camping, hunting.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.260
And we have equipment to sew me back up.

25:09.260 --> 25:10.220
Definitely.

25:10.220 --> 25:11.060
Okay.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.340
I mean, the mobile lab is probably a better option

25:13.340 --> 25:15.940
for cutting off your foot than the hatchet

25:15.940 --> 25:17.460
that you see on the wall.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.220
You would only know that

25:19.220 --> 25:21.420
because you critically succeed on the sanity.

25:21.420 --> 25:24.580
Otherwise that hatchet's the best thing in the world.

25:24.620 --> 25:25.980
All right, so I'm gonna bring them back

25:25.980 --> 25:26.820
and then you can act.

25:26.820 --> 25:27.660
Yes?

25:27.660 --> 25:28.500
Yeah.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.660
Okay.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.140
Hello, come on back please.

25:33.660 --> 25:34.780
Is this, okay.

25:34.780 --> 25:38.420
Doreen just screams fuck

25:38.420 --> 25:40.460
and just runs outside to the mobile lab.

25:42.740 --> 25:43.740
Runs outside?

25:43.740 --> 25:44.580
Runs outside.

25:44.580 --> 25:45.460
Do you leave the door open?

25:45.460 --> 25:46.300
She left us.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.100
No, I closed the door behind me.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.300
To the cabin.

25:49.300 --> 25:50.140
To the cabin.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.580
You just slam it behind you as you run out?

25:51.580 --> 25:52.420
Yeah.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.860
She left us.

25:54.860 --> 25:55.940
She left us.

25:57.340 --> 25:58.500
Dr. Hooch, you're up.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.020
All right.

26:00.020 --> 26:00.860
Fuck.

26:01.780 --> 26:05.100
Did I see the tick going towards Doreen?

26:05.100 --> 26:05.940
I don't know.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.140
Did I tell you that you saw a tick going towards Doreen?

26:09.180 --> 26:10.020
No, I don't think so.

26:10.020 --> 26:10.860
I don't think you saw a tick going towards Doreen.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.220
Okay, so all I know is that my potion

26:13.220 --> 26:14.820
has been poured on a foot

26:14.820 --> 26:16.980
instead of where I intended for it to go.

26:16.980 --> 26:18.460
Uh-huh.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.380
Hey, quick question.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.300
Doreen, did you leave the rest of the vial,

26:21.780 --> 26:24.260
the rest of the cauldron on the ground next to you?

26:24.260 --> 26:25.740
And did you pour all of it?

26:25.740 --> 26:27.580
No, remember at the end of the last episode

26:27.580 --> 26:28.420
I said not all of it.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.260
Not all of it.

26:29.260 --> 26:30.580
Okay, okay, so there's a little bit left.

26:30.580 --> 26:33.620
Okay, so I forget my British character.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.020
Of course, yeah.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.740
Fuck, God, God damn it.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.100
Oh my God, my potion.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.380
I jump for the cauldron.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.020
I dive for the cauldron and grab it

26:43.020 --> 26:44.620
and I scoop the rest of it up in it

26:44.620 --> 26:46.260
and I'm on the ground scooping up

26:46.260 --> 26:48.100
the rest of the potion into the cauldron.

26:48.140 --> 26:48.980
Carl's going.

26:51.380 --> 26:52.580
Is Carl near me?

26:52.580 --> 26:54.220
No, he's on the other side of the pool table.

26:54.220 --> 26:55.780
So yeah, I mean, he's just across

26:55.780 --> 26:57.420
the pool table from you, I suppose.

26:57.420 --> 27:00.660
Still elbows, staring at the corpse

27:00.660 --> 27:02.380
of his younger brother who he fucking killed

27:02.380 --> 27:03.940
and having a hard time getting over it.

27:03.940 --> 27:05.580
It becomes clear to me pretty quickly

27:05.580 --> 27:07.620
that Carl's emotions are gonna hinder us

27:07.620 --> 27:09.340
in this process so I just throw

27:09.340 --> 27:11.980
the rest of the cauldron on his face.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.940
Holy shit, okay.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.620
Yeah, go ahead and roll athletics just to,

27:16.620 --> 27:18.460
I mean, I'll give you a plus 20

27:18.460 --> 27:21.260
because he is completely still

27:21.260 --> 27:23.940
and this seems pretty easy but in order

27:23.940 --> 27:25.460
to get it enough of it.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.820
And not on Jerome.

27:26.820 --> 27:28.220
Oh, fuck.

27:30.940 --> 27:31.780
Yeah.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.820
49, or 46 on a 50.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.660
Oh, nice, yeah.

27:34.660 --> 27:36.860
So it splashes all over the face

27:36.860 --> 27:38.660
of Carl Lambert and he's like,

27:38.660 --> 27:43.660
whoa, what the, you're not British?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.980
British?

27:45.980 --> 27:50.340
As he like slowly slumps onto the ground

27:50.340 --> 27:54.780
and Jerome is like, is that gonna knock him out

27:54.780 --> 27:56.260
or kill him, what did you just do?

27:56.260 --> 27:57.100
It'll just knock him out,

27:57.100 --> 27:58.500
he'll just sleep real good for a bit.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.340
Okay, okay, what's next?

28:00.340 --> 28:01.180
What's next?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.780
Fuck, fuck, where'd she go?

28:02.780 --> 28:03.700
What is she doing?

28:03.700 --> 28:05.060
It's Chuckster's turn.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.980
I pull out my burner phone.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.820
Well, I got this, guys.

28:09.900 --> 28:14.900
And then I Google why this Bigfoot be a tick now though.

28:20.180 --> 28:21.500
And then if you could just tell me

28:21.500 --> 28:24.100
what my Google search results are.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.380
Pull up your phone, grab your phone.

28:25.380 --> 28:26.220
Yep.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.220
Google why this Bigfoot be tick now.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.060
Though.

28:29.060 --> 28:29.900
Though.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.060
Are you spelling though out

28:31.060 --> 28:33.300
or is it just a THS situation?

28:36.260 --> 28:38.060
Tick now though.

28:40.460 --> 28:41.660
Stupid.

28:41.660 --> 28:42.860
It says six steps what to do

28:42.860 --> 28:44.220
when you find a tick on yourself.

28:44.220 --> 28:45.980
Okay, this is great information.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.940
Let's read off at least the first one.

28:48.940 --> 28:49.780
Oh, wait, hold on.

28:49.780 --> 28:53.820
The third result is a song by big homie G called Tick.

28:53.820 --> 28:56.460
All right, Chuckster gets distracted by a song

28:56.460 --> 28:59.660
instead of looking up what to do with a tick bite

28:59.660 --> 29:02.220
which might've actually helped you in this situation.

29:02.220 --> 29:03.780
It is Carl's turn.

29:03.780 --> 29:05.620
He is asleep on the ground.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.620
On a drink so I can't speak up,

29:07.620 --> 29:08.980
bitch sucking my dick up.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.740
If she bites, she gonna beat up.

29:10.740 --> 29:13.580
I won't take no disrespect from no ho.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.300
I'm a crazy bitch, I'm psycho.

29:16.300 --> 29:18.420
Not a tip like a light show.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.460
Gee, where you been?

29:19.460 --> 29:20.460
Hell if I know.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.740
Smoking runts, head in the sky, ho.

29:22.740 --> 29:25.060
She says she's sick of me, bye ho.

29:25.060 --> 29:25.900
I fucking hope.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.060
Pull up that skirt, skirt.

29:27.060 --> 29:29.060
Watching bitches stalk my bio.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.140
I can't go nowhere without my money or my iron.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.660
Okay, this is literally Chuckster's clicked on it

29:33.660 --> 29:35.500
and this is just playing from his phone

29:35.500 --> 29:37.060
and he's just looking at it now.

29:37.060 --> 29:38.540
You fucking monster.

29:39.460 --> 29:43.100
Janice's turn and Janice is still under him.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.580
He is literally straddling Janice Ruth,

29:46.580 --> 29:49.220
an asthmatic older woman,

29:49.220 --> 29:52.780
and playing the song over his phone.

29:52.780 --> 29:54.020
It is fucking-

29:54.020 --> 29:55.900
Okay, honestly though, it's so relevant

29:55.900 --> 29:58.180
because it says Johnny did these teeth.

29:58.180 --> 30:00.820
Whole lotta cheese for these VV's.

30:00.820 --> 30:03.660
I don't hardly be smiling but my shit big

30:03.660 --> 30:06.580
when I say cheese like Carl's teeth.

30:07.100 --> 30:07.940
Oh my God.

30:10.140 --> 30:13.260
The truth comes out, I am big homie G.

30:14.420 --> 30:15.980
This just turned into an episode

30:15.980 --> 30:16.900
of Righteous Gems.

30:19.380 --> 30:22.740
Oh my God, okay, it is Doreen Marine's turn.

30:22.740 --> 30:24.100
Wait, so I wasn't helpful?

30:24.100 --> 30:26.020
Oh no, I think you were extremely helpful.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.820
I thought it was fucking, hey, I love you

30:28.820 --> 30:29.860
and I loved that.

30:29.860 --> 30:30.700
Oh my God.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.340
Thank you, so I'm helping the mission

30:32.340 --> 30:33.380
is what they all think?

30:33.380 --> 30:37.220
I mean, unless there's like something in the wave,

30:37.220 --> 30:39.580
like it would not be out of the realm

30:39.580 --> 30:42.260
of Delta Green possibilities for the wavelengths

30:42.260 --> 30:46.460
like underneath a song played by a certain Google search

30:46.460 --> 30:49.540
would like pull up some sort of like spell like ability

30:49.540 --> 30:51.140
in the air of the situation

30:51.140 --> 30:53.300
but this is not one of those times.

30:53.300 --> 30:55.100
Can I roll, wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:55.100 --> 30:59.020
Can I roll military science?

30:59.020 --> 30:59.980
Cause hear me out.

31:00.620 --> 31:05.620
The military has been studying how to use music

31:06.300 --> 31:09.940
to brainwash people into telling the truth.

31:09.940 --> 31:12.700
Did you learn that in your one week at basic?

31:12.700 --> 31:14.940
I spent two months there bitch.

31:14.940 --> 31:17.380
And also, I'm sorry.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.660
And also, so anyway, I think that I was

31:20.660 --> 31:23.540
on the special forces team of basic training.

31:23.540 --> 31:24.500
Oh my God.

31:24.500 --> 31:28.780
I passed, so anyway, do with that what you will.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.180
Your military science would tell you

31:31.180 --> 31:34.300
that the action that you've just taken is not helpful.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.820
Doreen, it's your turn.

31:39.820 --> 31:42.220
What can I say here?

31:42.220 --> 31:44.420
Is there anything off limits to say?

31:44.420 --> 31:46.180
Let's have them take their headphones off.

31:46.180 --> 31:48.340
Yeah, and let's just get this over with.

31:50.340 --> 31:51.180
Wow.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.540
Oh my God.

31:52.540 --> 31:54.620
I mean, for your sake dude.

31:56.260 --> 31:57.940
Okay, because I mean.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.620
You're doing this alone?

31:59.620 --> 32:03.220
Well, my actual brain wants to,

32:03.220 --> 32:05.020
I'm trying to channel Doreen,

32:05.020 --> 32:08.100
but I'm thinking like if I have full sanity during this,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.060
my first thought would be I'm gonna run out

32:10.060 --> 32:12.380
and grab tools to do this and come back.

32:12.380 --> 32:13.220
And come back, okay.

32:13.220 --> 32:14.460
And ask for help.

32:14.460 --> 32:15.380
Right, okay.

32:15.380 --> 32:18.340
Because if they know what's going on, it will help me.

32:18.340 --> 32:19.980
And if I'm fully sane.

32:19.980 --> 32:20.940
Totally.

32:20.940 --> 32:21.780
Yeah.

32:21.780 --> 32:24.300
The excruciating pain in your foot is growing

32:24.340 --> 32:28.100
as you feel the bones in your foot begin to shatter.

32:28.100 --> 32:28.940
I'm ready to get it off.

32:28.940 --> 32:32.060
All of the bones in your foot just shattered

32:32.060 --> 32:37.060
and your muscles are beginning to rip apart and reform.

32:37.460 --> 32:40.940
All the tendons are stretching out in your foot.

32:40.940 --> 32:44.700
You've never felt this much pain in your entire life.

32:44.700 --> 32:45.820
Roll sanity.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.140
Am I like hopping back into the?

32:52.140 --> 32:52.980
Ugh.

32:54.820 --> 32:56.300
No.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.140
What did you roll?

32:57.140 --> 32:58.260
99.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.660
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:59.660 --> 33:00.980
Fucking 99.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.460
Are you serious?

33:02.460 --> 33:04.300
Those dice are fucking cursed, dude.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.300
These dice suck, I'm mad.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.180
Hey, that's a critical failure.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.020
I know.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.340
On you realizing that you're about to turn

33:11.340 --> 33:13.220
into a goddamn Bigfoot.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.100
And you're by yourself.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.100
I'm by myself.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.340
I'm trying to get back, I tried to get back.

33:20.340 --> 33:21.180
I tried.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.940
Okay, so I'm gonna have you roll fight, flight or freeze

33:25.940 --> 33:26.780
in this situation.

33:26.780 --> 33:27.980
So I want you to rank them.

33:27.980 --> 33:29.140
You're gonna roll a D six,

33:29.140 --> 33:31.540
which is just the normal standard six sided dice

33:31.540 --> 33:33.700
that you would use in normal games.

33:33.700 --> 33:35.900
I say normal games like they're not lame.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.500
Okay, so here's what I want you to do.

33:38.500 --> 33:42.460
I want you to rank from most likely to least likely,

33:42.460 --> 33:45.380
fight, flight or freeze.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.940
So what is the most likely?

33:46.940 --> 33:48.900
So fight.

33:49.540 --> 33:51.460
Sorry, fight.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.060
Allie and Taylor are being fucking wild,

33:54.060 --> 33:55.060
rubbing their ears.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.700
They have no clue what's going on.

33:57.980 --> 34:00.540
You're making too much noise.

34:00.540 --> 34:01.660
That's fair.

34:01.660 --> 34:02.820
Oh, you can hear that?

34:05.140 --> 34:06.500
No, I really can't hear anything.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.700
I can't, I can't.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.660
Okay, so I would definitely, my number one go to

34:10.660 --> 34:11.940
as Dorian would be fight.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.660
Okay, so that's four, five and six.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.020
And then flight.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.140
Okay, so that's two and three.

34:16.140 --> 34:16.980
And then freeze.

34:16.980 --> 34:18.340
Is one, so roll a D six.

34:20.340 --> 34:21.180
Seven.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.540
What the fuck?

34:24.540 --> 34:27.620
I said, it's only got six sides Lindsay.

34:27.620 --> 34:29.580
I read it wrong, I read it wrong.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.660
It's a fancy dice, I couldn't see the thing.

34:31.660 --> 34:33.660
Four, five, six is fight.

34:35.180 --> 34:38.580
Hey Lindsay, Dorian Marine sees

34:41.100 --> 34:44.340
a set of tools next to her.

34:44.340 --> 34:45.700
She grabs a saw.

34:46.700 --> 34:50.940
She's smart enough in this moment to strap her leg down

34:50.940 --> 34:54.820
on this stretcher that is meant for the Bigfoot corpse.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.100
And she cuts.

34:57.100 --> 34:59.740
The first one is not the hardest actually.

34:59.740 --> 35:02.580
Well, I'm feeling this other pain that seems worse.

35:02.580 --> 35:05.180
It does seem worse until you hit a nerve.

35:06.460 --> 35:07.580
And that's just this.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.420
Just like running through the back of your head.

35:14.180 --> 35:18.260
I mean, you just begin almost like violently coughing

35:18.260 --> 35:20.860
and choking and your stomach hurts.

35:20.860 --> 35:24.140
And if you have any food in your stomach, it's coming up

35:24.140 --> 35:27.620
and you're just sawing and sawing and you start crying.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.780
Tears are running down your face.

35:29.780 --> 35:33.220
Just like hit the bone and then boom, you're just sawing.

35:33.220 --> 35:36.340
Saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw, saw

35:36.340 --> 35:38.180
until finally crack.

35:38.180 --> 35:42.540
This feeling is growing as it goes up into your ankle.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.300
And as those bones begin to shatter

35:45.300 --> 35:46.900
and the muscles begin to break,

35:46.900 --> 35:50.100
it helps you cut the rest of your foot off.

35:50.100 --> 35:54.260
Your entire foot is only hanging on by the skin

35:54.260 --> 35:56.620
that is on the back of your calf,

35:57.500 --> 36:00.260
attached to the skin on the back of your ankle

36:00.260 --> 36:03.860
as you finally have cut through your Achilles tendon.

36:03.860 --> 36:06.420
Just for listeners right now, I'm literally crying.

36:06.460 --> 36:07.300
Yeah.

36:11.220 --> 36:15.020
I mean, you start bleeding out almost immediately.

36:15.020 --> 36:20.020
And so I need you to roll a D six and then add two

36:20.660 --> 36:22.540
for how much hit points you lose.

36:25.900 --> 36:26.740
One.

36:26.740 --> 36:27.580
Wow, okay.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.180
So one plus two is three, you lose three hit points

36:30.180 --> 36:35.180
and Lindsey, you're gonna lose one D four to blood loss

36:35.340 --> 36:38.460
every round until this is fixed.

36:38.460 --> 36:41.820
What's your highest skill of medicine first aid?

36:41.820 --> 36:43.720
Whoa, hang on.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.740
I have zero in both.

36:46.740 --> 36:48.540
Oh, you're fucked, dude.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.820
Until someone comes out here,

36:49.820 --> 36:51.980
you're bleeding out one D four per round.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.860
Can I like scream as loud as possible for help?

36:54.860 --> 36:56.460
Yes.

36:56.460 --> 36:58.340
Yes, and I'll have them roll alertness.

36:58.340 --> 36:59.180
Okay.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.540
Do you need me to like scream?

37:00.540 --> 37:01.980
That was absolutely miserable.

37:01.980 --> 37:02.820
No, that was good.

37:02.940 --> 37:05.140
I'm leaving the room from now on for those.

37:05.140 --> 37:05.980
Yeah, sorry.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.500
I thought that that wouldn't take as long,

37:07.500 --> 37:09.660
but then some crazy fucking shit happened.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.740
So Mabi, oh, Ellie.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.820
She's scrolling this.

37:13.820 --> 37:14.900
She's on Pinterest.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.700
You on Pinterest, girl.

37:16.700 --> 37:20.140
I was, I'm looking at pre-ordering the Elden Ring.

37:20.140 --> 37:20.980
It looks so funny.

37:20.980 --> 37:22.420
Oh, fuck yeah.

37:22.420 --> 37:25.780
I need Dr. Miller, Rusty Hooch and the Chuckster

37:25.780 --> 37:28.860
all to roll alertness real quick for me just to kick off.

37:28.860 --> 37:29.700
Yes.

37:31.380 --> 37:33.500
That's a big ass fail.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.100
Big fail for me too.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.380
Okay, Chuckster, you're the only one who hears

37:37.380 --> 37:42.260
just the slightest faintest, just like blood curling scream.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.660
Very, very muffled, but coming from outside.

37:45.660 --> 37:46.820
Dr. Miller, it's your turn.

37:46.820 --> 37:48.300
My D dog.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.020
What's going on with my D dog?

37:50.020 --> 37:50.860
Okay.

37:52.380 --> 37:53.460
Seeing that she said like,

37:53.460 --> 37:56.060
don't leave this house because we're all gonna die.

37:56.060 --> 37:59.260
She's very disappointed in her colleague, Dr. Marine.

37:59.260 --> 38:04.260
So she is going to take out a firearm from her hazmat suit

38:07.300 --> 38:11.260
and actually follow Doreen ready to threaten her

38:11.260 --> 38:13.060
to not leave and get back into the house.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.980
And so she's gonna run after Doreen.

38:14.980 --> 38:16.220
Yeah, you're gonna be able to make it

38:16.220 --> 38:17.620
to the back of the van.

38:17.620 --> 38:20.540
So you can start off the next turn, opening up that door.

38:20.540 --> 38:23.300
It's gonna move on to Dr. Hooch.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.220
Not Carl or Janice or anyone.

38:28.460 --> 38:31.300
I mean, I want Dr. Hooch to have some power.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.940
I just thought you were skipping.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.980
Oh no, I'm actually skipping Jerome in this moment.

38:34.980 --> 38:35.820
That's my bad.

38:35.820 --> 38:38.020
Jerome, where'd she go?

38:38.020 --> 38:39.060
Alien bug.

38:39.060 --> 38:41.300
Someone tell me what the fuck is going on here.

38:41.300 --> 38:43.500
I didn't know this shit was happening either.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.460
You've knocked him out.

38:44.460 --> 38:45.580
Do we need to...

38:45.580 --> 38:46.940
Janice, are you okay?

38:48.340 --> 38:52.780
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay.

38:53.140 --> 38:54.820
I just need you to stay calm.

38:54.820 --> 38:58.500
Okay, do you need to be on her right now?

38:58.500 --> 39:02.180
I was just getting comfortable, but I mean, I guess not.

39:02.180 --> 39:04.620
Hey, Janice, you gonna be cool?

39:04.620 --> 39:06.580
Janice, be cool, please.

39:06.580 --> 39:09.180
She trusts Jerome dire enough to where she's like,

39:09.180 --> 39:10.820
okay, okay.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.580
And she's just gonna walk back over

39:12.580 --> 39:15.740
and go sit on the couch that's in the corner of the room.

39:15.740 --> 39:16.860
And she's just sitting there

39:16.860 --> 39:18.780
and she's just got her head in her hands

39:18.780 --> 39:21.460
and she starts weeping uncontrollably.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.980
Dr. Falsom, what do we do?

39:25.980 --> 39:27.300
What is the plan?

39:27.300 --> 39:28.140
What is happening?

39:28.140 --> 39:29.780
You've got two people gone already.

39:29.780 --> 39:33.100
I'm losing trust in Jerome Dyer.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.260
I'm becoming suspicious of him.

39:35.260 --> 39:37.060
Okay, I pull out a gun, I point it right at Jerome

39:37.060 --> 39:39.300
and I say, show me your fucking ID right now.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.260
What the fuck, dude?

39:41.260 --> 39:42.740
Are you kidding me?

39:42.740 --> 39:44.500
I'm the one who brought you here.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.540
I don't trust you for shit.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.420
You have no, you clearly have no fucking clue

39:47.420 --> 39:48.820
what's going on. What would my ID do?

39:48.820 --> 39:49.660
Show it to me.

39:50.340 --> 39:52.780
Can she roll like an alertness or something

39:52.780 --> 39:54.020
to see if she trusts him

39:54.020 --> 39:56.220
or like to see if he's doing anything that might be.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.060
Roll human.

39:57.060 --> 39:57.900
Okay.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.180
Human intelligence.

39:59.180 --> 40:00.340
It's reading people.

40:00.340 --> 40:01.740
Hugh Mint.

40:04.020 --> 40:04.860
Is it 10?

40:04.860 --> 40:06.700
Mr. Mint, Hugh Mint.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.020
48 on a 10.

40:08.020 --> 40:12.260
Yeah, unaware you continue your shitty line

40:12.260 --> 40:13.940
and questioning piece of shit.

40:13.940 --> 40:17.020
And he's like, I don't know what this will prove,

40:17.020 --> 40:19.740
but he reaches back in his back pocket.

40:19.740 --> 40:22.820
Okay, as he's reaching down, I just fucking tackle him.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.420
Jesus Christ.

40:24.420 --> 40:26.420
Okay, roll unarmed combat.

40:30.740 --> 40:32.620
35 on a 40.

40:32.620 --> 40:33.540
98.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.460
Yeah, you take him right to the ground.

40:35.460 --> 40:37.260
I mean, he's a small little nerd man.

40:37.260 --> 40:42.260
And so fucking bang having banging black turtleneck

40:42.260 --> 40:47.260
wearing Dr. Hootch just like lunges over the pool table,

40:47.740 --> 40:51.740
over the corpse and just spears this dude into the ground.

40:51.740 --> 40:52.820
Tight tackle, bro.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.460
I'm saying, what do you know?

40:55.460 --> 40:56.300
What do you know?

40:56.300 --> 40:57.580
I know you know something.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.580
I don't know shit.

40:58.580 --> 40:59.540
What the fuck?

40:59.540 --> 41:00.580
We're just trying to stop.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.260
There's an alien bug apparently

41:02.260 --> 41:04.660
and you're not doing anything to stop it.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.100
And it's Chuckster's turn.

41:06.100 --> 41:10.380
I'm still like humming the tune of my big homie G song.

41:10.380 --> 41:11.740
And it's Carl's turn.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.500
No, I'm still humming it under my breath.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.460
And then I kind of like come to and I'm like,

41:17.460 --> 41:18.300
what are we doing?

41:18.300 --> 41:20.420
We can't be fighting ourselves, bros.

41:20.420 --> 41:24.380
We gotta be helping each other take down this alien dick.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.020
Now I say we all go out there and check on our friend.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.180
Come on.

41:28.180 --> 41:30.860
I am trying to keep control of this situation clearly

41:30.860 --> 41:31.980
because nobody else is.

41:31.980 --> 41:33.780
Everyone's just letting sheer chaos happen.

41:33.780 --> 41:35.740
So I'll just hold down the Fort in here.

41:35.740 --> 41:39.020
I'm still on top of Carl or Jerome, sorry.

41:39.100 --> 41:41.820
You're on top of the sleepy, sleepy Carl.

41:43.020 --> 41:44.980
I'm keeping control of this situation.

41:46.620 --> 41:47.700
Okay, so you leave?

41:47.700 --> 41:49.260
Yeah, I'm gonna run after Dr. Miller.

41:49.260 --> 41:50.300
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.820
So Carl's still asleep.

41:51.820 --> 41:54.100
Janice Ruth is crying on the couch.

41:54.100 --> 41:59.100
And Doreen, you've got a D4 to roll please.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.420
A D4.

42:01.420 --> 42:02.260
It's a pyramid.

42:02.260 --> 42:03.080
It's a little pyramid.

42:03.080 --> 42:03.920
This guy?

42:03.920 --> 42:05.220
Yeah.

42:05.220 --> 42:06.060
Three.

42:06.060 --> 42:07.180
Three.

42:07.180 --> 42:08.020
You know what to do.

42:08.060 --> 42:10.180
Like in yellow, back in yellow, back in yellow.

42:10.180 --> 42:13.380
Dr. Miller, you run out into the darkness.

42:13.380 --> 42:15.920
The street lamp is shining down.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.220
It's the only thing.

42:17.220 --> 42:18.820
Snow begins falling.

42:18.820 --> 42:20.060
I think that's nice.

42:20.060 --> 42:22.420
Snow begins falling down through the street light.

42:22.420 --> 42:24.840
It's actually really, really beautiful.

42:24.840 --> 42:25.680
And as you-

42:25.680 --> 42:28.180
It's the most wonderful time.

42:28.180 --> 42:32.780
Starts playing as you open up the back doors

42:32.780 --> 42:34.740
of this sprinter van.

42:34.740 --> 42:37.500
And Lindsay, can you describe what she sees?

42:37.820 --> 42:40.140
I'm still just screaming and like growling

42:40.140 --> 42:45.140
and trying to put pressure on this nub of a leg.

42:46.820 --> 42:49.660
Could you demonstrate the screaming and the growling?

42:49.660 --> 42:50.500
Ugh.

42:52.020 --> 42:52.920
Something like that.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.440
Like big, nevermind.

42:55.340 --> 42:56.180
Like big what?

42:57.180 --> 42:58.420
Big poop sounds.

42:58.420 --> 42:59.720
Yeah.

42:59.720 --> 43:00.560
I understand.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.980
I didn't understand before, but now I get the sound.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.060
You know when someone cuts off their foot

43:05.060 --> 43:06.660
and they make sounds like-

43:06.660 --> 43:07.500
Big poop sounds.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.340
Big poop sounds.

43:08.340 --> 43:09.180
Poop, poop, poop.

43:09.180 --> 43:10.340
Wait, wait, wait.

43:10.340 --> 43:12.780
She's putting pressure on a fucking nub.

43:12.780 --> 43:13.620
On a nub.

43:13.620 --> 43:17.460
And you see her foot and ankle standing up

43:17.460 --> 43:19.460
on the stretcher next to her.

43:19.460 --> 43:22.740
She's like strapped her leg down onto the stretcher.

43:22.740 --> 43:25.700
Blood is pouring out between her fingers.

43:25.700 --> 43:28.100
She has no idea what to do.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.860
She is at less than half of her hit points.

43:31.860 --> 43:34.820
And so she is turning white in the face

43:34.820 --> 43:38.700
as she's crying and screaming and gurgling.

43:38.700 --> 43:43.700
And literally the foot that is next to her is transforming.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.860
So I need you to roll sanity real quick.

43:47.860 --> 43:50.240
Oh, Jesus Christ.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.420
Bigfoot foot.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.860
Bigfoot foot, but only the foot so far.

43:53.860 --> 43:54.780
Point of a Bigfoot.

43:54.780 --> 43:59.780
Yeah, that's a big old 91 on 55 sanity.

44:01.460 --> 44:03.180
This is extremely unnatural.

44:03.220 --> 44:07.900
And so I'm going to have you roll a D4 and add one.

44:07.900 --> 44:09.020
Four.

44:09.020 --> 44:10.060
Four plus one?

44:10.060 --> 44:10.880
Three plus one.

44:10.880 --> 44:11.720
So four.

44:11.720 --> 44:15.500
Oh, just one shy of that temporary insanity.

44:15.500 --> 44:19.100
You lose your fucking shit because this foot,

44:19.100 --> 44:21.540
you would know as a medical doctor

44:21.540 --> 44:24.100
that you can see the bones,

44:24.100 --> 44:27.620
part of which is sticking out of this foot

44:27.620 --> 44:31.140
that's just sitting on this stretcher next to Doreen Marine.

44:31.140 --> 44:33.040
The bones are shattering

44:33.040 --> 44:36.220
and then seem to be reforming themselves

44:36.220 --> 44:39.560
as the tendon, the Achilles tendon that she's severed

44:39.560 --> 44:42.300
begins to stretch and grow out.

44:42.300 --> 44:45.020
Like all of these things are trying to grow.

44:45.020 --> 44:48.500
As they're shattering, you see the blood that's spreading out

44:48.500 --> 44:50.860
and all the blood is coming up to the surface in this foot.

44:50.860 --> 44:52.940
It's rapidly turning purple,

44:52.940 --> 44:55.340
as well as the blood that's hitting the air up top

44:55.340 --> 44:56.660
is finally oxidizing.

44:56.660 --> 44:59.340
So red is starting to pour over the top

44:59.340 --> 45:02.020
of all of these bruised and bloody foot

45:02.020 --> 45:05.220
and Doreen is bleeding the fuck out

45:05.220 --> 45:07.140
and with your sanity failure,

45:07.140 --> 45:11.100
you're not able to attempt to stop the bleeding this round.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.660
The Chuckster is running up behind you in this moment.

45:13.660 --> 45:15.940
I think Dr. Miller turns around and throws up.

45:15.940 --> 45:18.240
And you see the exact same thing

45:18.240 --> 45:20.640
and I need you to roll a sanity as well.

45:20.640 --> 45:21.480
Okay.

45:22.740 --> 45:24.500
Really low odds of me.

45:24.500 --> 45:28.820
Ah, 23 on a 33.

45:29.420 --> 45:31.260
It's the first time I passed a sanity check.

45:31.260 --> 45:35.860
You run up, you see Dr. Miller has turned towards you

45:35.860 --> 45:37.260
and begins throwing up.

45:37.260 --> 45:41.180
You nimbly dodge out of the way of this vomit

45:41.180 --> 45:45.420
and you peek your head around and see Doreen Marine

45:45.420 --> 45:48.940
and this foot, her bloody situation, what do you do?

45:48.940 --> 45:52.140
So one thing about Chuck that you guys don't know

45:52.140 --> 45:54.380
is he's very astute

45:54.380 --> 45:57.700
and he puts things together really quickly as, yeah.

45:57.700 --> 45:58.540
Oh, really?

45:58.540 --> 45:59.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:59.860 --> 46:01.900
Did not know that about Chuck at all.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.480
Yeah.

46:04.480 --> 46:06.820
Yeah, so he doesn't talk about it that often.

46:06.820 --> 46:08.500
He's a real humble boy.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.200
But anyway, so he puts together

46:11.200 --> 46:13.380
that the tick must have gone inside

46:13.380 --> 46:17.440
and that if he shoots the leg,

46:17.440 --> 46:18.900
it's just gonna leave again

46:18.900 --> 46:20.140
and maybe infect something else.

46:20.140 --> 46:23.100
So he wants that tick to stay inside the foot

46:23.100 --> 46:25.480
and he notices a deep freeze.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.520
So he's gonna throw the foot in the deep freeze

46:28.360 --> 46:29.200
and lock it.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.020
Smart.

46:30.020 --> 46:31.500
And then he says, not today Bigfoot foot.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.340
Yeah.

46:36.340 --> 46:37.880
And then he fist bumps himself.

46:42.320 --> 46:44.480
Extremely excellent work.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.880
Thank you so much.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.760
And Doreen, you continue to bleed out.

46:48.760 --> 46:49.600
Roll a D4.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.500
Yeah, sorry, Doreen.

46:53.640 --> 46:54.800
I'm gonna die.

46:56.040 --> 46:56.980
Oh shit.

46:58.080 --> 46:58.920
Three.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.080
How many hit points do you have?

47:00.080 --> 47:01.440
Five.

47:01.440 --> 47:02.280
Bummer town.

47:02.280 --> 47:04.480
All right, you are down to two hit points now.

47:05.460 --> 47:08.040
What happens when you run out of hit points?

47:08.040 --> 47:08.880
You die.

47:08.880 --> 47:09.700
Death.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.480
There's no death saving throws.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.300
There's no negative hit points.

47:14.300 --> 47:15.140
It's not like-

47:15.140 --> 47:16.640
No potions can save me.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.720
You fall unconscious at one or two hit points

47:19.720 --> 47:23.300
if you do not fail a constitution check.

47:23.300 --> 47:26.480
So Doreen has two hit points.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.720
She is going into shock from blood loss.

47:29.720 --> 47:33.320
You have to pass a constitution check

47:33.320 --> 47:35.440
or you will fall unconscious

47:35.440 --> 47:38.640
and you will still lose a D4 from blood next round.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.500
I think I was lost.

47:46.640 --> 47:47.480
Let's see.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.280
She's like shaking.

47:50.280 --> 47:51.920
28 on a 55.

47:51.920 --> 47:53.280
That is a success.

47:53.280 --> 47:57.440
Doreen Marine can keep her eyes open

47:57.440 --> 47:58.920
for a little bit longer.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.620
You know, before she fucking dies.

48:02.620 --> 48:04.080
It's Dr. Miller's turn.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.580
Wouldn't it be Hooch's turn?

48:05.580 --> 48:07.520
Hooch, you're on top of Jerome Dyer

48:07.520 --> 48:09.600
whose actual turn it is

48:09.600 --> 48:12.560
and he is not trying to fight you.

48:12.560 --> 48:17.400
He is just laying there and he lets his body go limp.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.360
He looks up at you and he says,

48:19.360 --> 48:21.200
do you think you're doing a good job?

48:21.720 --> 48:25.420
Wow, he got you so good.

48:25.420 --> 48:27.920
I don't even acknowledge him.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.160
I do get off of him,

48:29.160 --> 48:31.240
but I'm just still kind of like pointing my gun

48:31.240 --> 48:32.080
in the general

48:32.080 --> 48:34.000
or are all three of them kind of in the same area

48:34.000 --> 48:34.820
at this point?

48:34.820 --> 48:36.160
You are on top of Jerome

48:36.160 --> 48:39.120
and you're literally next to a face down,

48:39.120 --> 48:43.260
like Carl is now snoring and he's face down,

48:43.260 --> 48:44.440
which is impressive.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.240
Like that he's still snoring face down.

48:46.240 --> 48:48.280
This guy, wow, what a body.

48:48.320 --> 48:52.280
And you can hear Janice is sniffling over in the corner.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.280
What a goddamn mess.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.000
My team is outside.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.640
There's a fucking kid on the fucking table.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.340
I gotta destroy some of this evidence.

48:59.340 --> 49:01.720
Yeah, that's what I'm here to help you do.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.280
So I'm still just kind of pointing a gun over in that area.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.600
I walk over to the cameras

49:06.600 --> 49:09.140
and can I roll computer science

49:09.140 --> 49:10.760
to just wipe all the cameras?

49:10.760 --> 49:11.600
Yeah.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.240
But we have to look at the footage.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.320
Nope, I'm wiping them.

49:14.320 --> 49:15.160
Oh my God.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.560
Wow, fucking rebel scientist.

49:18.560 --> 49:19.880
83.

49:19.880 --> 49:23.280
83, Jerome notices what you're doing

49:23.280 --> 49:27.580
and I don't mean to, you seem very,

49:30.040 --> 49:34.160
do you want, I'm, this is, I'm good at,

49:34.160 --> 49:35.520
I'm good at this stuff.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.520
You're gonna have to prove it

49:36.520 --> 49:38.880
because you've done jack shit since we've gotten here.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.120
Before you finish the sentence,

49:40.120 --> 49:42.320
he's already finished clearing one camera,

49:43.320 --> 49:45.920
which literally meant like,

49:45.920 --> 49:49.220
he took out the SD card from it and like steps on it.

49:50.640 --> 49:53.520
And then he's like, staples.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.400
That was easy.

49:57.240 --> 49:58.320
I don't like you.

49:59.280 --> 50:00.520
That seems clear.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.360
Do you want to help me with the rest of these?

50:02.360 --> 50:06.240
Janice looks up and is like, who are you?

50:06.240 --> 50:09.540
What, how do you, why are you?

50:10.760 --> 50:12.060
And he turns around and he's like,

50:12.660 --> 50:15.300
well, obviously it wasn't Bigfoot Janice.

50:16.140 --> 50:17.500
I just point my gun back at her.

50:17.500 --> 50:19.820
I just say, shut the fuck up Janice.

50:19.820 --> 50:20.940
I liked Jerome.

50:24.580 --> 50:26.980
Dr. Miller, you've already lost your sanity.

50:26.980 --> 50:28.860
You can pull your shit together here.

50:28.860 --> 50:31.580
You have to save this woman.

50:31.580 --> 50:33.900
If you can pass a first aid check,

50:33.900 --> 50:37.740
you will stop the bleeding and give her one D4 hit points.

50:37.740 --> 50:41.900
Dr. Miller is going to turn around to Chuck and say,

50:42.580 --> 50:43.580
you guard that thing with your life.

50:43.580 --> 50:47.340
Pointing towards the ice bag that he put the foot in.

50:47.340 --> 50:50.500
And then she's going hurriedly trying to stop the bleeding.

50:50.500 --> 50:55.260
And Chuck's just like sitting on top of this deep freeze.

50:55.260 --> 50:58.940
I'm doing the like surfer sign where you stick your thumb

50:58.940 --> 51:01.340
and your pinky out and you shake it.

51:01.340 --> 51:02.180
And you shake it.

51:02.180 --> 51:03.020
And you shake it.

51:03.020 --> 51:05.580
And Dr. Miller says, tubular bra.

51:08.100 --> 51:09.060
Righteous.

51:09.300 --> 51:13.260
And rolls a 90 fucking five.

51:13.260 --> 51:14.100
Oh my God.

51:16.260 --> 51:17.500
Sorry, Doreen.

51:17.500 --> 51:18.940
Bye Doreen.

51:18.940 --> 51:19.780
Bye.

51:19.780 --> 51:21.340
Holy shit.

51:23.740 --> 51:26.100
Dr. Miller starts fumbling with her things.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.540
And she's like, you're going to be all right.

51:27.540 --> 51:28.380
You're going to be all right.

51:28.380 --> 51:29.540
Okay. You have to survive.

51:29.540 --> 51:31.140
Just trust me.

51:31.140 --> 51:31.980
Trust me.

51:31.980 --> 51:35.900
And you just can't find the exact shit you're looking for.

51:35.900 --> 51:36.740
I don't know.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.580
I don't know.

51:37.580 --> 51:38.580
Like you're looking for gauze.

51:39.580 --> 51:41.660
You're looking for anything to like,

51:41.660 --> 51:43.700
to maybe burn the, you know,

51:43.700 --> 51:45.260
singe the flesh at the bottom

51:45.260 --> 51:47.860
to try to cauterize the wound, anything.

51:47.860 --> 51:51.700
But you just can't find what you're looking for.

51:51.700 --> 51:55.700
Why can't I find anything in this fucking car?

51:55.700 --> 51:57.060
Yeah. She starts panicking.

51:57.060 --> 52:00.260
And then continues to look at Doreen

52:00.260 --> 52:03.540
trying to be like, you're going to be fine, all right?

52:03.540 --> 52:04.380
You're going to be fine.

52:04.380 --> 52:05.540
Just trust me.

52:05.540 --> 52:07.740
Give me one moment.

52:07.740 --> 52:10.180
As she continues to look for things,

52:10.180 --> 52:11.820
fumbling like a fucking idiot.

52:12.860 --> 52:15.260
Like the fucking idiot she is.

52:15.260 --> 52:17.660
I didn't mean that, Dr. Miller.

52:17.660 --> 52:18.900
I heard that, Chuck.

52:20.780 --> 52:24.260
I just like sadly put my surfer hand down.

52:27.260 --> 52:31.220
Back inside, Jerome and Dr. Hooch are wrapping up

52:31.220 --> 52:32.940
and Jerome is like, okay.

52:32.980 --> 52:36.780
And I think we'd uploaded on this laptop here.

52:36.780 --> 52:41.780
So Dr. Hooch, you actually see on this laptop,

52:42.620 --> 52:45.580
you see some of the pictures that they took

52:45.580 --> 52:48.540
and it's the strangest thing.

52:48.540 --> 52:51.460
They're all blurry.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.860
It'll be like a picture of the two of them

52:53.860 --> 52:56.700
throwing up peace signs on either side of the pool table.

52:56.700 --> 52:59.300
Like, ah, we got it.

52:59.300 --> 53:03.300
There's this like incomprehensible blurry thing

53:03.300 --> 53:04.580
on the table.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.740
It's almost like there's some sort of cloaking

53:06.740 --> 53:10.220
that this creature might have that would make it

53:10.220 --> 53:14.340
so that no one could get like a clear picture of it,

53:14.340 --> 53:16.580
no matter how good the equipment was,

53:16.580 --> 53:17.660
no matter how hard they tried.

53:17.660 --> 53:19.740
It's almost like the pictures you've seen

53:19.740 --> 53:21.940
of Bigfoot in real life.

53:21.940 --> 53:25.140
Why can't anyone get a good picture of Bigfoot?

53:25.140 --> 53:25.980
Maybe that's why.

53:25.980 --> 53:27.300
Roll sanity.

53:28.300 --> 53:30.940
48 on a 53, baby.

53:30.940 --> 53:31.780
Success.

53:31.780 --> 53:34.060
You're like, damn, I figured out Bigfoot.

53:36.260 --> 53:38.180
Okay, are you finished up there?

53:38.180 --> 53:39.020
Fuck.

53:39.020 --> 53:40.940
Y'all can't hire a fucking photographer

53:40.940 --> 53:42.740
that knows how to take a good damn picture?

53:42.740 --> 53:46.540
Look, it's like it auto-focused on my face and Carl's face,

53:46.540 --> 53:48.740
but it didn't, Jesus.

53:48.740 --> 53:51.380
It just seems like no one here knows what y'all are doing.

53:51.380 --> 53:53.460
I start like just scrubbing through the photos,

53:53.460 --> 53:55.940
frantically trying to see if there's one that's in focus.

53:55.940 --> 53:56.900
Not a single one.

53:57.380 --> 53:58.220
I just throw my hands up in the air.

53:58.220 --> 53:59.540
I'm so frustrated.

53:59.540 --> 54:00.940
Where's my fucking team?

54:00.940 --> 54:02.500
They all just ran outside.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.180
And I open up the front door and just look outside.

54:05.180 --> 54:06.700
Yeah, you can smell death.

54:06.700 --> 54:08.900
And Chuckster, it's your turn.

54:08.900 --> 54:12.380
I'm gonna valiantly take my shirt off.

54:13.900 --> 54:15.060
Nice.

54:15.060 --> 54:16.180
Hell yeah.

54:16.180 --> 54:19.140
But like I could easily just pull it over,

54:19.140 --> 54:20.460
you know, and it would come off easily.

54:20.460 --> 54:25.140
But instead I like rip it from the collar down.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.820
So it like still has like part of it.

54:26.820 --> 54:29.540
Like one sleeve is still on, but yeah,

54:29.540 --> 54:31.620
there's got a big patch in the front that's off.

54:31.620 --> 54:33.060
And I wrap that around her nub.

54:33.060 --> 54:36.820
Okay, go ahead and roll first aid to save her life.

54:39.180 --> 54:40.340
Not good odds, but.

54:42.900 --> 54:44.260
I pass!

54:44.260 --> 54:46.100
36 on a 40.

54:46.100 --> 54:47.300
I save her.

54:47.300 --> 54:49.420
Oh my gosh, the Chuckster is so tight.

54:51.980 --> 54:54.460
Doreen reaches up and gives him a little pat on the head.

54:54.540 --> 54:55.380
Hold on, let's go back.

54:55.380 --> 54:56.820
I mean, you're patting him on the head

54:56.820 --> 54:58.180
as he's wrapping this around.

54:58.180 --> 55:01.660
And you see Dr. Miller is still just frantically going out.

55:01.660 --> 55:05.180
I mean, just like throwing shit out of the cabinets

55:05.180 --> 55:07.980
all over behind her, trying to figure this out.

55:07.980 --> 55:10.180
You guys are almost like dodging shit

55:10.180 --> 55:11.500
that she's throwing out, being like,

55:11.500 --> 55:13.180
why can't I find it?

55:13.180 --> 55:14.780
Why can't I find it?

55:14.780 --> 55:18.580
And you're just like calmly wrapping your torn t-shirt

55:18.580 --> 55:20.300
around the nub at the bottom.

55:20.300 --> 55:23.980
And I'm giving her little eyebrows, like while I do it.

55:24.500 --> 55:26.540
Oh, this is the patch up the soldier moment.

55:26.540 --> 55:28.380
Okay, one of you guys.

55:28.380 --> 55:32.340
As you're patting his, I mean, roll a D4 please to see.

55:33.620 --> 55:35.340
You're able to stop the bleeding,

55:35.340 --> 55:37.740
which is the most important thing.

55:37.740 --> 55:41.940
And with three hit points back in your system,

55:41.940 --> 55:43.740
that takes you back up to five.

55:43.740 --> 55:47.100
And you're able to kind of stabilize your breathing.

55:47.100 --> 55:48.820
You're still extremely panicked.

55:48.820 --> 55:50.820
You're on the verge of throwing up at any moment.

55:50.820 --> 55:52.020
You're extremely pale.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.660
You've lost a lot of blood.

55:54.180 --> 55:57.220
You do not feel well, but you at least have someone

55:57.220 --> 55:59.820
who is your fucking savior now.

56:00.940 --> 56:04.380
I knew there was a reason I loved you, kid.

56:04.380 --> 56:06.420
You do remind me of my whippet.

56:06.420 --> 56:07.260
Ha ha ha.

56:07.260 --> 56:08.080
Ha ha ha.

56:08.080 --> 56:08.920
Ha ha ha.

56:08.920 --> 56:09.740
Ha ha ha.

56:11.740 --> 56:13.820
This might be too forward,

56:13.820 --> 56:16.260
but do you want to celebrate Christmas together?

56:17.260 --> 56:18.100
Ha ha ha.

56:20.380 --> 56:21.740
It's January.

56:21.740 --> 56:22.660
Ha ha ha.

56:22.700 --> 56:26.020
Doreen is so happy to have something wrapped around her.

56:26.020 --> 56:28.020
She was like, absolutely.

56:28.020 --> 56:28.860
Yes.

56:28.860 --> 56:29.700
Yes.

56:29.700 --> 56:30.540
Yes.

56:30.540 --> 56:31.380
Yes.

56:31.380 --> 56:32.200
Yes.

56:39.200 --> 56:44.620
Searing star, deafening heat.

56:44.620 --> 56:49.540
You don't know where you found it.

56:49.740 --> 56:54.740
In this heat, as your eyes fall short,

56:55.380 --> 57:00.380
you better learn how to keep it.

57:20.540 --> 57:26.380
Clasp your fist over all the blood.

57:26.380 --> 57:30.860
Water leaks through your fingers.

57:30.860 --> 57:36.660
You're standing in a swirling flood.

57:36.660 --> 57:41.660
And only darkness leaves.

57:49.540 --> 57:54.540
And only darkness leaves.

58:02.540 --> 58:07.540
Falling fast into a deep abyss

58:08.540 --> 58:13.540
till it's reaching out again.

58:13.540 --> 58:18.540
Find your theme on your broken bones.

58:18.540 --> 58:23.540
Be your outlaw or he is your king.

58:48.540 --> 58:53.540
He is your king.

59:19.540 --> 59:24.540
He is your king.

59:25.540 --> 59:30.540
He is your king.

59:31.540 --> 59:36.540
He is your king.

59:37.540 --> 59:42.540
He is your king.

59:43.540 --> 59:48.540
He is your king.

59:49.540 --> 59:54.540
He is your king.

59:55.540 --> 01:00:00.540
He is your king.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.540
He is your king.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:12.540
He is your king.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:18.540
He is your king.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:24.540
He is your king.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:30.540
He is your king.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:36.540
He is your king.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:42.540
He is your king.

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.540
He is your king.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:54.540
He is your king.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:00.540
He is your king.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:06.540
He is your king.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:12.540
He is your king.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:18.540
He is your king.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:24.540
He is your king.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:30.540
He is your king.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:36.540
He is your king.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:42.540
He is your king.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.540
He is your king.
