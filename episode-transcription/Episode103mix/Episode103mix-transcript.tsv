0	7240	How do you do fellow wolf pups? It's your fellow teen wolf. Wolf the dog pup.
7240	13080	I like to skateboards, roller them blades, and vape that juice.
13400	17240	When I spit them hot stinky thick gunky clouds
18040	25840	Shoot, dang. I get so many likes and so many subscribes and I am streaming at you live from
25840	34480	694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that is also where I am currently living.
34480	36480	I am the influencer.
36880	40400	My influence shall know no bounds.
40400	47840	I shall eat Mark Zuckerberg's eyes so that he may see the dark void for all eternity.
48160	50160	Smash that like button.
50680	53600	This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Zach.
53640	61680	But not the one you know. From occupied Piscataway and Anacostian land known as Washington, DC
62240	69600	who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. A very productive use of 15 seconds.
69600	75040	He writes, I have a little love song for a very special something in my life.
75600	78560	My baby takes the morning train.
78960	86800	As shelter from the rising sun, she will return to me again to finally waitin' for her.
86800	93360	My baby's eyes can see through time. She sings to me what must be done.
93360	98880	The life I had's no longer mine. The world is waitin' for her.
100000	105200	Wow, Zach. What a wonderful ditty you done and gone and composed over there.
105760	110800	The only songs I write cannot be interpreted by human ears.
110800	114640	I think yours can though, so that's probably good.
115200	120240	Anyway, if you want to write up something for your influencer wolf to how,
120240	123920	tag it pretending pod on Instagram or Twitter.
123920	128320	These fuckers at pretending to be people repost amazing fan art,
128320	130480	share behind the scenes moments,
130480	137360	and dish out hot visual content with every new episode over on that there social media.
138080	145360	Life is full of grays, complex situations, so fuck Mark Zuckerberg and smash that follow button.
145360	149360	Fuck Jack Conte and support us on Patreon. Fuck me?
149360	154960	And picture whatever it is you think I look like the next time you're about to bust a whole nut.
154960	160800	Then you'll inevitably want to have a little snooze, but keep it up. It's time for the news.
161840	166720	Last time, Clark ran away from the site of the shimmering silver sea
166720	173120	and into Dr. Marie Jacobs and Salem the cat in Doug Jacobs' body.
173120	178800	He kept fleeing, but the next door brought him through the same threshold he had just crossed.
178800	182960	He bumped into John, who had just opened up the same hatch,
182960	188560	and the two stumbled forward to greet the witch doctor and her cat man familiar.
188560	194560	Down the ladder, Keith lied to the boat's hosts, Don D. Pettymore and Jack Russell.
194560	198800	He told them he knew where the door Jack searched for was located.
198800	205440	From this sea level view, Keith saw a rope bridge on the adjacent wall to the ladder he had just
205440	211840	used that led to a second stilted bunker above this shiny sterling surf.
211840	217200	Back in the room that wasn't filled with junk and a helpless Leo piston,
217200	221760	Clark and John yucked Dr. Marie Jacobs yum for a while,
221760	228000	and then John found solace in his quantumly colorful orifice ooze.
228000	234480	I think the image of old John squirting goo out his face holes would make for some sick album art.
234480	240480	Speaking of, take a moment. Check out Bandcamp or Spotify or MySpace
241440	247280	For those of you who are too young to remember, MySpace is my temperature contrasting basement
247280	253040	studio where I find the hottest new tracks with the coolest album art.
253600	259120	An example might be Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?
270480	300320	Uh, Thomas, Joe, any last words?
300560	301280	Last words.
302400	307680	Yeah, sorry we ended on such a banger for you last time that you really want to...
307680	308560	Okay, headphones off.
310720	313360	You want to, you just want to shut us down, you just don't want to...
313360	314240	Like, all of us?
314240	317040	Yeah, this was just an exercise to like,
317040	321440	oh, thanks for doing that, but that's worthless to me now. Now's a new moment.
321440	322720	Yeah, that was a week ago.
322720	325040	Is it all disposable to you? Is that what this is?
325600	327200	Yeah, right?
328160	330000	Disposable, like a camera.
330480	332400	Or thumbs on a human.
332400	334160	Yeah, disposable thumbs.
336880	338560	That's what makes me a human.
338560	339920	That's what sets us apart.
340720	342080	Yeah, our disposable thumbs.
342080	346560	Uh, Zach, if we say anything else, it's basically going to be half this episode
346560	350880	in conversation with Marie Jacobs, so why don't you just go on over to those other boys?
350880	353760	Thank you. I appreciate it.
353760	356640	Take your headphones off. Thomas, take your headphones off.
356640	357140	Joe.
358160	358640	Thank you.
358640	362080	Hello, Luke and Justin. Hi.
362080	362800	Hello, Rosanne.
362800	367840	Hi. You guys are climbing a ladder. You guys are climbing a ladder.
368800	374880	First on the ladder is Jack Russell, this man in a beanie, big fluffy beard.
374880	379520	And behind him, Keith Vigna, who's looking up and just said, nice view.
380640	384400	And then behind him, Don D. Pettymore, the three of you are climbing the ladder,
384400	391360	just after Keith Vigna came to a realization about where the hatches were
391360	394080	in the room you're about to walk up into.
394080	400560	And then where the rope bridge is that is seemingly not attached to a door
400560	404320	that you could see in this bunker-like room that you were in before.
404320	410160	This bunk yard, junker bunker, junker junk yard bunker, piston junk yard bunker yard.
410800	414480	The man above you kind of looks down between the ladder
414480	419280	and his big belly and sees you below and is like, oh, you new boy.
419280	420160	How'd you get here?
420800	421840	Are you talking to me?
421840	425600	Yeah, me and the other fella here was old cats.
425600	426960	We got here different ways.
426960	427680	How'd you get here?
427680	428800	I kind of floated in.
429360	430240	Floated?
430240	430800	Yeah.
430800	433840	No, I mean, what got you before you fell up?
433840	436080	What got me? Goo.
436080	436580	Goo?
437040	438400	Where are you from, boy?
438400	440880	Contention, USA.
440880	441840	What about you?
441840	444560	You sound like you're from across the pond.
444560	446880	I'm from Contention too, but...
446880	448720	Well, not you, this other guy.
449280	450240	Oh, this guy.
450240	452480	You sound like you're from across the pond.
452480	453920	No, I'm from Contention.
453920	456320	I thought he was talking about like the actual creek.
456320	458720	You sound like you're from across Bean's Pond.
460640	463600	You know, the dialect, it do change if you go, yeah.
463600	466800	It's very distinct from one side of Contention to the other.
466800	469840	Honestly, mate, I feel like I've lived so many lives.
469840	473520	I'm so old, you know, my memories just feel like someone else's.
473520	474480	How old are you?
474480	475360	I don't even know.
476000	478000	I have a lost period of time there.
478000	479600	How did you guys get here?
479600	480720	What is here?
480720	481760	Where are we?
481760	485200	No fucking clue, but we're looking for the door out.
485760	487680	Do you know where it is or...
487680	490960	And at this point in time, you've easily climbed a 10 yard long ladder.
491520	497600	And so the three of you will go back into this junkyard of a room
497600	503600	where you do hear the crying sounds of Leo Piston as he is just in tortured pain.
506960	511520	Jack Russell turns around, helps you finish up the ladder trek,
511520	513280	does the same for Don D. Pettymore.
514160	515840	Leo, I feel awful bad.
516800	518720	Are you just gonna lay there or...
518720	521760	Nah, I can't do anything else.
521760	523040	It hurts too bad.
523040	523840	Are you gonna...
523840	525040	Do you think you're gonna make it?
525040	527680	Are you gonna be better or is this the rest of your life?
530880	532400	Forever, probably.
532400	535040	If you find a way out, I guess come get me.
535840	536800	Okay, okay.
536800	537760	Will do, will do.
538640	541120	I'm sure that I will not forget about you.
543200	545280	Hey, what's your name again?
545280	546560	Who, me?
546560	548080	The kid, you, yeah.
548080	549520	That's Leo Piston.
549520	549840	Ligma?
549840	550880	No, but you.
550880	553120	Me? I'm Keith.
553120	553760	Yeah.
553760	554960	Keith Vigna.
554960	556400	Keith, who the hell is that?
556400	558560	That, I just told you, it's Leo Piston.
558560	560800	Oh, I thought you said Ligma Piston.
560800	561760	Ligma Piston.
567040	570080	Yeah, Leo runs the up dog.
570080	578480	God damn it.
578480	580800	I wanna know what the goo is, mate.
580800	584800	I got here because I got eaten by some fucking monster in a lake.
584800	589680	He got here because he jumped through, I don't even fucking believe him.
589680	593040	I took a step in a, in a bag.
593040	593680	What?
593680	594320	A bag?
594320	595520	And I got here.
595520	596880	What sort of bag?
596880	599760	Here's a Nike bag.
601840	602160	Oh.
603680	606320	Things go in, they, they usually don't come out.
606880	607680	Where'd you get it?
608240	609200	I've always had it.
609760	610880	You've always had-
610880	612720	It's, I, I use the bag.
612720	613760	You still have it?
613760	614640	Do I still have it?
614640	614880	Yeah.
615440	615840	No.
615840	616480	Where is it?
616480	617600	That's how I got in here.
618160	619520	So we're in your bag?
620880	626160	Maybe we gotta find another bag or a hole in the ceiling.
626880	628320	Where the bag opens up.
628320	632000	Yeah, but I got here because I got eaten by a fucking lake monster.
632000	633040	Which lake?
633040	634080	Lake Comb.
634080	635840	At Comb Comfy Campground.
635840	637440	Oh, I thought you said comb.
637440	639600	Like, you gotta talk better, man.
640160	643920	Now if you just listen better, you can understand my friend Jack Russell here.
643920	644560	That's right.
644560	646880	Should we walk across that bridge?
646880	652400	Jack Russell starts moving all the junk that's in the way on that wall that's adjacent to
652400	654480	where you just walked into this room.
655440	657840	He clears this wall, there's no hatch.
657840	664560	Leo, did you see where, where'd, uh, where'd, uh, my friends go?
665120	666160	Did you forget their names?
666160	667040	Clark and John.
668240	669200	Jesus Christ.
669200	671200	I had a total brain fart there.
674320	675200	How do you not know?
675200	678960	Clark and John went through that hatch and he points to the other hatch.
678960	684080	I look at Jack and Don and kind of point at that hatch.
684640	687280	You guys, well, after you, I guess.
687280	688480	Lead the way, Jack.
688480	690960	All right, I guess, well, yeah, we'll all just go in here.
690960	693200	I mean, what, you got any other ideas?
693200	694800	Oh, no, I guess not.
694800	698880	And he slams open the lever of the hatch and opens up the door.
698880	699680	What do I see?
700320	707840	Clark and John, their backs as they are standing in a empty room that does not have a ceiling
707840	709600	on it, or maybe it does.
709600	712640	It's all just this, I found the top of the bag.
712640	720960	And they are talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs and Doug Jacobs who are laying on the ground.
720960	722160	Dr. Marie Jacobs.
722160	725200	When was the last time I saw them?
725200	729680	Oh, the last time you saw them was on a security camera because they weren't in their cell
729680	730640	anymore.
730640	734640	And you looked at the security footage and saw them being picked up and slammed into
734640	735840	the ground repeatedly.
735840	738400	And then they disappeared as if you had never seen them.
738400	741680	Yeah, and then that just didn't stick in my mind, apparently.
741680	743600	That was just normal goings on.
744400	750880	Clark Bishop and John Lee, Kevin Moore III, you feel the hatch behind you open.
751840	758960	And as you turn around, you see that Keith Vigna, Keith Beans, has arrived into this
758960	767520	room along with Don D. Pettymore and this man wearing the beanie and the overalls that
767520	769280	are made of corduroy.
769280	773440	Before you ask anything, we've got the cat fucking all out of control.
774160	775040	Or under control.
775040	775440	What?
775440	777360	Cat fucking is under control.
777360	779120	It's not out of control, it's under control.
779120	781520	Now what the hell are you boys doing under your boat?
781520	784400	I thought that was the boat that would take us out of here eventually.
784400	785520	Oh, we tied it up.
785520	786160	All right, all right.
786160	792800	As I'm now closer and I'm realizing that my eyes weren't paying tricks on me, Don D.
792800	801200	is kind of frozen a little bit, seeing what appears to be his brother, but with kind of
801200	802720	a different sounding voice.
803360	809280	Also, as you look at him, you know how you've been in here for a while and you've kind of
809280	815680	gotten used to seeing that everything's made out of this inky black substance that is also
815680	822800	super colorful and is also the sky, but also like objects are kind of that color or texture
822800	823520	too.
823520	832240	That same substance is pouring out of John Lee, Pettymore the Third's bodies, eye sockets
832240	834960	and nose and mouth and ears.
835600	836960	Are you okay, John?
836960	838160	Ever been better, Keith?
838160	840320	You look crazy right now.
840560	846240	Do you not see what's happened to touch your face?
846240	846960	Can you feel it?
847600	849920	I mean, no, you can't feel it.
849920	851280	It does look cool.
851280	858960	Brother, I don't want to alarm you, but you got oozed, oozing out your orifices.
858960	859520	That's right.
860080	860640	That's right.
861200	863120	I'm the ghost of your brother.
863120	863440	Boo!
867040	868240	Stupid piece of shit.
868800	870400	I'm your brother, asshole.
872560	874000	Yeah, I'm your brother.
874000	875040	What's going on?
875040	876560	How you doing, bro?
877600	879200	Something seems off about him.
879200	881760	Can I roll like a human or something?
881760	882560	Yeah, yeah.
882560	884640	Go ahead and roll persuade against him, Thomas.
887520	888320	I rolled a two.
891120	892560	Tension building.
892560	895040	Sorry, my other D10 fell on the floor.
899200	902160	Oh, yeah.
902160	902640	All right.
902640	905280	That's a 22 on a 60 crit success.
905280	906160	Hell yeah.
906160	907360	All right, nice.
907360	908640	So this is your brother.
908640	911040	It's been a while since you've seen him, huh?
911040	916880	So I mean, God, it's been years and then it's been however long you've been in here.
916880	921440	John, how did you get down here?
921520	929360	John really exaggeratedly rolls his eyes to the side at Keith and Clark.
930560	933200	I need to talk to you for a second.
934320	936400	Violently stabbing his eyes to the side.
936400	937840	Hold on one minute.
937840	939840	Big brother, little brother.
944880	946080	I think I'm your big brother.
946080	947520	Am I your big brother?
947520	948880	And you used to call me little brother.
948880	949840	That's why I said that.
949840	954240	Big brother, I'll be gone for just a second to talk to these fellows,
954240	957680	but I do need to confer with my associates for just a second.
957680	959200	But then we'll catch up.
959200	960160	Clark, Keith.
961440	964160	And then he's really stabbing his eyes to the side.
964160	969120	Hey, if you guys need to talk for a second, we will stay in here with the cat lady
969120	971120	and you can go back in through this hatch.
971120	973840	And he kind of opens up the hatch that's open.
973840	977600	Oh, he opens it more back into the Leo piston bunker junkyard.
977600	978320	All right.
979200	981120	Nobody asked you, British guy.
981120	983920	But while y'all are in here, do not fuck that cat.
983920	984640	We'll be right back.
985680	986400	Puts out his hand.
987440	990080	John reluctantly shakes it as he's trying to walk back.
990080	991920	And he's like, again, no one asked.
991920	993200	We will be right back.
993200	994400	This won't take long.
994400	998080	As Clark walks past Jack, he shakes his hand too.
998080	998880	Like the dog.
998880	999280	Huh.
999280	1000960	And then keeps following into the next room.
1000960	1003120	Okay, I guess, Justin, take off your headphones
1003120	1004480	because Thomas doesn't want you here.
1005280	1008480	Goodbye.
1008480	1011680	Justin, the person knows exactly what this conversation is about.
1012800	1014880	He just failed the persuade role about it.
1014880	1021040	So he can be here, but this, this huddle is literally just John saying,
1022560	1028560	all right, now you might not have quite picked up on what was going on in there.
1029120	1030800	Might've been a little too subtle.
1030800	1032400	I never knew you had a brother, John.
1032400	1033200	That's just the thing.
1033200	1036160	I don't my pappy did because I'm in the body of my pappy.
1036160	1036960	That's my uncle.
1036960	1037680	Right, right.
1039200	1045280	So why are you, do you just not want to frighten him by telling him who you are?
1045280	1046800	I just, we don't know.
1046800	1048640	We don't know who we can trust Keith.
1048640	1051200	We don't know what is going on in this world.
1051200	1057040	Is that my uncle or is that the goo manifest in some kind of trader could be either way.
1057040	1060720	It might behoove us to have some kind of advantage over him.
1060720	1062880	Like, you know, the hidden identity.
1062880	1065360	John, what was your relationship with this guy?
1065360	1066640	Is he a, is he a good uncle?
1066640	1068400	Is he, was it a strained relationship?
1068400	1070240	Did you, did you know him very well or?
1070240	1073360	Now by many more standards, he was a pretty good uncle.
1073360	1079920	Like about half the time he'd take you on into the bar instead of you having to sit
1079920	1080800	out in the hard car.
1080800	1081920	That's nice of him.
1081920	1085920	That puts him in the top quarter for sure of my uncles.
1085920	1088880	But at the same time, he's a vicious criminal.
1089440	1095360	Uh, he's a mean son of a bitch and I don't really recall all my past lives, but I believe
1095360	1096160	I owe him money.
1096160	1097840	Is this the one you were telling us about?
1097840	1098960	Yeah, it is.
1098960	1101520	And he always just seemed to take a shot into my daddy.
1101520	1106800	So it, I just, perhaps while I have this physical form, I'm my daddy.
1106800	1108560	That's my only strategy here.
1108560	1113040	I don't have steps ahead to this thing that it just felt it's an instinctual move.
1114080	1114320	Yeah.
1114320	1118800	Support that or we just, do we eliminate the last 20 minutes of this podcast and just go
1118800	1120080	in there and tell him who I am?
1125520	1127120	No, I got your back.
1127120	1131520	I think playing our cards close to the vest at this point is the best idea if we got the
1131520	1132640	leg up on them already.
1132640	1134560	Open up your heart, Jon.
1134560	1135440	Shut up, Leo.
1136400	1137840	Yeah, shut the fuck up, Leo.
1138640	1139600	I'm still here.
1140720	1143040	You better not tell him who we is.
1143040	1144400	You're not a part of this.
1144400	1146320	So don't try to be part of the cool.
1146560	1149520	You're not part of the quick, but solving the mystery.
1149520	1150240	Yeah, we know.
1152960	1154320	Cope, Leo Cope.
1154320	1156880	We got to go talk to important people in that other room.
1156880	1160800	Just fucking try not to make too much noise while you're in here.
1162000	1163120	God damn.
1163120	1169600	I was, I was thinking you guys remember those pictures that the camera took of the people
1169600	1173600	and the, it was basically just complete blackness.
1174800	1176080	What if that's that room?
1176560	1178320	Or all around us, right?
1178320	1183920	And it, in the kind of the, the state of being we, we, we, or, or, yeah, just this place.
1184720	1191280	I wonder if what, you know, if that's the thing and what it means, but what, what does
1191280	1191520	it mean?
1191520	1192400	Where the hell are we?
1192400	1193840	Where the hell are we?
1193840	1195920	We're in the goo world where I'm from.
1195920	1196720	You're from what?
1198000	1200800	Have you not seen my God damn goo eyes?
1200800	1204320	I mean, yeah, but catch up Clark.
1205040	1206000	I'm Keith.
1206080	1213600	I mean, mustard Clark, the mundane design, the mundane designations of the old world
1214480	1217680	kind of ceased to cease to interest me as I spend more time.
1218320	1221600	I don't know if this is the same experience for all of you, but for me right now, there's
1221600	1226960	a lot of things that seem impossible and yet are every day, they seem normal and not normal
1226960	1228160	all the time at the same time.
1228880	1232320	And when, when John just said that he's from here, that didn't ring any bells for him.
1232320	1234720	That didn't ping any, any alarms for me.
1234720	1236880	Oh, uh, that's the end of the last episode.
1236880	1238080	You should go listen to that.
1238080	1242080	No, I'm saying it didn't, it didn't scare me that you said that and it sounded normal.
1242080	1243360	It sounded correct.
1243360	1243680	Yeah.
1243680	1244400	Yeah.
1244400	1245600	The Samesies, bro.
1245600	1247040	Let's go lie to my uncle.
1247040	1251200	What were you guys talking to Dr. Marie Jacobs about?
1251200	1253760	Oh, like very little before you burst in.
1253760	1256320	You'll honestly get as much a chance to talk to her as we would.
1257120	1260640	Basically we just established, well, we accused her of cat fuckery.
1260640	1264400	I don't know if you noticed, but Doug's in there also, but that Salem and Doug's body
1264400	1264960	remember.
1264960	1270000	So, and they were, they were cuddling in a really unsettling way.
1270000	1270480	Exactly.
1270480	1271200	Right.
1271200	1273840	Well, yeah, that's the question.
1273840	1280800	Cause she's all like, Oh, isn't it just normal for a person to just be like hanging out with
1280800	1283360	their cat and then other stuff.
1283360	1285200	And you're like, well, what does other stuff mean?
1285200	1288240	And she's like, how dare you say what other stuff means, you know?
1288240	1290480	And it's like, she's fucking her cat.
1290480	1291760	I think that's illegal.
1292640	1303760	I think we might have to do something about that.
1305840	1308240	You're absolutely right, Keith.
1308240	1312160	But we, I think we need to get some information out of that cat fucker.
1312160	1316400	And I agree that can, that can wait until after it.
1316400	1317680	So she's another one.
1317680	1322080	We're just going to have to lie to you and kind of be like, Hey, we are cool with you
1322080	1324960	and we're not about to arrest you for fucking your cat man.
1324960	1326800	Also, there's just a question of jurisdiction.
1326800	1330960	It doesn't seem quite practical here, but we will get to the bottom of all of this.
1330960	1337440	John Clark, you notice that a lot of the junk on the wall that is adjacent to the two walls,
1338160	1344480	basically four walls in this piston bunker junkyard and two of the walls that are parallel
1344480	1346800	with each other have hatches on them.
1346800	1350560	But then one of the walls has been cleared of junk.
1351200	1354800	So you can clearly see that junk has been moved.
1354800	1358640	So you can see three walls now, two with hatches, one without.
1358640	1360400	Leo, you've been picking up in here?
1360400	1361840	You've been, you've been cleaning up?
1361840	1366640	And no, that beast guy came in here, knocked it down and said, why isn't there a fucking
1366640	1367200	hatch here?
1367200	1372160	If you want to go onto rope bridge, whatever Keith was talking about.
1372160	1372480	Yeah.
1372480	1374080	Jack Russell cleared it out.
1374080	1376080	Why did they clear out the wall without the door?
1376080	1377760	Would you see if there was a door behind it?
1378960	1379680	I would assume.
1381280	1383360	Why would they do that though Keith?
1383360	1391920	Uh, or we, uh, uh, I was under the impression that we cleared the junk to see if there was
1391920	1392320	a door.
1393200	1394880	I will never find out now.
1397040	1398960	Listen to the episode.
1398960	1402960	At the end of the day, it seems like, uh, that these two guys, your uncle and whoever
1402960	1408480	the Jack Russell is, they've got, they got more of a situational awareness to maybe let's
1408480	1410000	talk to Jack and Don.
1410000	1414000	Don said he got in, got here from a bag.
1414000	1415280	He has a Nike bag.
1416800	1419200	He got in it and that's how he got here.
1419200	1420480	Clark gasps.
1420480	1422560	Did it, did the bag fall into it?
1422560	1424480	Oh, he got in the bag and now he's here.
1424480	1429360	Yeah, he's, we're, he's in the bag, which means we're in the bag, which in that room
1429360	1435360	in there, there didn't seem to be a ceiling on that room.
1435360	1442080	And so I was thinking maybe that is the, how we got to climb up out of the bag or something.
1442080	1443840	Oh, you think we're, we're in the bag.
1443840	1447280	We could technically also be in a giant lake creature.
1447280	1451520	Why would the roof of the bag be described as having endless stars?
1451520	1457920	Cause it might be nighttime and the bag is pointed up at the sky.
1457920	1460000	But you can't see that through the bag, bud.
1460640	1462080	Well, the bag's probably open.
1462080	1466400	To, to, to recap though, that bag is the thing that we were throwing, or we were told to
1466400	1469360	throw balls into that they said they didn't know where those, where those went.
1469360	1473280	So now we know that guess that they come here, or at least that's what happens when a person
1473280	1474080	goes in the bag.
1474080	1479200	Who said just something, perhaps an episode ago about a ball falling from the sky into
1479200	1480080	this very ocean.
1481040	1481600	Was that Marie?
1481600	1482240	That was me.
1483200	1485280	That, oh, hey bud.
1485280	1486640	Hey, you want to talk to me again?
1487280	1493360	Yeah, how many balls, how many balls you seen fall from the sky?
1493360	1495600	I reckon one so far.
1495600	1497440	That was probably the ball we dropped in here.
1497440	1498080	Yeah.
1498080	1500400	We've only dropped one ball in here, right?
1500400	1501600	Two now, I guess.
1501600	1503200	And John looks kind of proud.
1503200	1504160	He slicks his hair back.
1504800	1510960	Uh, I'm embracing my identity, Keith.
1510960	1511280	Sorry.
1511280	1514720	My headphones just like stopped working, but now they're back.
1514720	1516240	So I didn't hear anything you said.
1516240	1517760	Well, just be happy for me.
1517760	1518640	I'm happy for you.
1518640	1519040	Thank you.
1519040	1523360	Also, Jack Russell said he got swallowed up by a lake creature, so we could also be in
1523360	1524400	a lake creature too.
1524400	1526400	And I mean, we didn't, we didn't go in a bag either.
1526400	1528480	We got sucked up by a wave of ooze.
1528480	1532400	So it's like all these different vectors point us in the same direction.
1532400	1537440	That ball came down here like a metal spider and jumped inside Julie Maxwell.
1537440	1542000	She went out the Marie Jacobs door, which we've been out twice now and wrapped back
1542000	1542960	around once.
1542960	1544800	And she wasn't, she wasn't between here and there.
1544800	1547200	Yeah, but then she left again out the other one.
1547200	1549840	Oh, she went out, she went out the, she went out the ocean door.
1549840	1553840	Yeah, she went out both of them a bunch of times.
1553840	1554800	Does she ever talk to you?
1554800	1556240	When did she finally leave?
1556240	1557360	She's coming and going.
1558080	1558580	Hmm.
1558960	1560400	When's the last time she left?
1561040	1563520	Um, two minutes ago.
1563520	1564400	Oh no.
1564400	1564880	Two minutes?
1564880	1567200	Like days, weeks, forever?
1567200	1568400	It was forever ago.
1568400	1569840	See guys, this is what I'm talking about.
1569840	1574080	This, this, this place is, is all, it's all backwards and forwards and yeah.
1574160	1577600	Makes it real easy to understand where people are.
1577600	1578720	They could be anywhere.
1578720	1580000	Well, I suppose that's true.
1580000	1581840	You know, I'm always right here though.
1581840	1582800	I'm right here.
1582800	1585520	We're actually, we're from a time where you weren't right here.
1586240	1587600	How do you feel about that?
1587600	1588800	That blow your little gourd?
1593680	1594160	All right.
1594160	1595840	Well, you know, I probably should.
1595840	1596560	That was mean.
1596560	1597200	That was mean.
1598080	1601840	I tried to feel superior to you because I'm not lying here, mortally wounded on my back,
1601840	1603120	just rolling around for eternity.
1604400	1611360	Oh, when you put it like that, will you please come find me?
1611360	1613920	If you find a way out, please bring me back.
1613920	1614160	Yeah.
1614160	1616880	I mean, yeah, that's, that's the goal.
1616880	1619360	Remember, I promise not to forget you, Leo.
1619360	1623520	And I, I am glad, you know, you don't got to keep reminding us.
1623520	1624160	We'll find you.
1624160	1629920	Well, if you promise to not forget me, then I'll remind you that you said something about
1629920	1633840	a bridge being on the other side of this wall, but there ain't no hash out.
1635040	1638640	That's why we were looking for the height of the hatch for the bridge.
1639360	1641040	There's a bridge on the other side of this wall.
1641040	1641920	That is that a fact?
1642880	1643120	Yeah.
1643120	1648080	There's a bridge and it goes to, uh, like a Terabithia.
1648080	1652160	No, it goes to, uh, that's a YA novel.
1652160	1654400	I don't know how to describe the thing.
1654400	1663200	It's, uh, if you were to Google Terabithia red sand forts, it would remind you of that.
1663280	1664720	No, I believe that's where we are.
1666240	1670800	But wasn't the bridge going to one of those in the ocean?
1670800	1671280	Okay.
1671280	1671440	Yeah.
1671440	1676080	So it goes to, there's a bridge to another one of the things of which we are currently
1676080	1676960	inside.
1676960	1678160	Is that the accepted theory?
1678880	1679680	Yes.
1680400	1682640	Did Don and Jack see it from their boat?
1682640	1684160	Is that how they knew it was there?
1684160	1687280	I saw it when I was down the ladder.
1687280	1687840	I saw it.
1688960	1692880	You saw a bridge extended from this feller over to another feller.
1692880	1695360	Maybe we should try to break, break through the wall.
1696720	1698640	Clark just wants to touch that wall.
1698640	1703280	He just wants to walk up to it kind of slowly, both arms outstretched and just kind of feel
1703280	1703600	it.
1703600	1704640	Is there anything there?
1704640	1705040	Oh yeah.
1705680	1712480	It feels like a little oozy like goo because it's dark and colorful and, uh, and your hand
1712480	1714240	just kind of like presses into it.
1715440	1719680	And it's a little wet and cold, uh, but then it's not at all.
1719680	1721120	It's just normal wall.
1722000	1724320	I don't break through the other side of it though or anything.
1724320	1729360	It's just, it's just a solid wall suddenly again at the same time as it being goo.
1729360	1729920	Of course.
1730560	1735440	John has a hunch and he wants to touch the wall in the exact same spot where Clark did.
1735440	1736880	What do you want to do about it?
1736880	1738400	Does my hand behave the same way?
1738400	1739520	What do you want to happen?
1739520	1741600	I want to see if I can just poke right on through.
1741600	1742720	Roll a natural.
1745520	1746160	Pass.
1746160	1748880	29 on a 60 whatever.
1748880	1749360	Describe.
1751760	1758560	You can see bad-ass like black ooze coming from John's fingernails and dripping down
1758560	1759520	his hand.
1759520	1765360	And as he touches the wall, the ooze from his fingernails kind of reaches out and little
1765360	1770400	tendrils and the wall reaches out and little tendrils back and they emerge and then his
1770400	1771840	hand just passes through.
1771840	1772320	Yup.
1772320	1774000	And he's like, Oh, I got us.
1774560	1779600	And John just kind of like whips open an opening because it's, it's just him.
1779600	1780400	It's the same thing.
1781120	1789040	What the absolute fuck is that?
1789040	1794800	As the other hatch opens, Jack Russell and Don D. Pettymore walk into this room as John
1794800	1803680	Lee moves his hands into this wall and makes an opening and you can see out there is a
1803680	1809120	looks like a rope bridge, but it's made out of the same texture that makes up the wall
1809120	1811760	and the sky and everything around you.
1811760	1819120	And it's a rope bridge that leads to a second bunker stilted above about 10 yards.
1819120	1821840	This shimmering silver sea.
1822800	1824720	Do you guys think we should go across?
1824720	1825920	I start walking across it.
1826880	1827760	Wait, Keith.
1827760	1833040	Keith, careful that, uh, we don't know where, uh, uh, Leo told us that Julie's ball now
1833040	1834960	and it sounds like maybe a mean ball.
1834960	1838640	I don't know if it's a good ball, like John here, or if it's a mean ball.
1838640	1841520	Like we've like a spine ripping ball.
1842240	1843360	She could, she could be anywhere.
1843360	1844400	You mean you ball.
1846560	1847920	I didn't mean anything by it.
1847920	1850960	Uh, you know, you know how I feel about you and what we're doing now.
1852000	1856480	I just mean there's, there's you type of balls and there's Julie Maxwell type of balls.
1856480	1860640	That seems like there's maybe a helpful ball and not, not helpful balls.
1860640	1862640	Mean, mean spine ripping balls.
1862640	1864640	Isn't John a spine ripping ball?
1864720	1868880	Yeah, I don't know what you, how do you know Julie's a spine ripping ball?
1868880	1871040	You don't know a goddamn thing about that ball.
1871040	1873520	You're just assuming that ball is going to rip your spine out.
1873520	1876240	I am assuming that because, because it did that to Julie.
1876240	1877120	That's what Leo said.
1877120	1879440	Leo said it came down and ripped her spine out.
1879440	1882160	Well, my ball did that to my daddy.
1882160	1883600	So do you have a problem with that?
1884720	1891200	I mean, I kinda, I didn't really realize that you were a spine ripping.
1891200	1893600	Yeah, we never talked about that, but that's crazy.
1894880	1900320	Dondi Pettymore is now hearing this entity inside of his brother.
1900320	1904080	Talk about ripping out the spine of his brother.
1904080	1908080	And for the second or third or millionth time this campaign,
1908080	1910000	Thomas has forgotten who's in the room.
1912880	1916240	John, shut the fuck up, uncle Don.
1916240	1918400	Yeah, I'm, I'm John.
1918400	1919280	I'm ball.
1919280	1921920	I just made this opening in the ooze.
1921920	1922720	Walk through it.
1922720	1926080	If you want to live, wait, you're any questions?
1926080	1927440	I didn't think so.
1927440	1929920	Get across the fucking bridge, uncle.
1929920	1934240	Dondi Pettymore has like a wild look in his eyes as he approaches.
1935120	1936560	What he thought was his brother.
1937360	1941120	John, John, little John, not the rapper.
1941120	1942400	Don't make a joke about the rapper.
1945600	1946240	What?
1946240	1947200	What?
1947280	1947760	Okay.
1953200	1953680	Oh no.
1953680	1954720	I said little John.
1954720	1955200	Oh no.
1957120	1959040	You said little John three times.
1961200	1964960	He grasps you and tries to like, like look, look into your soul.
1964960	1966320	Is that you boy?
1966320	1967360	Yeah, it's me.
1967360	1968960	How the hell did you get in my brother?
1970000	1972080	I kind of want to know that now too, I guess.
1972080	1976000	Well, so what happened is, but y'all know I'm ball.
1976000	1977280	You know I'm ball.
1977280	1978640	You all know this.
1978640	1980080	What the hell is ball?
1980080	1981120	We've talked about me.
1982080	1988400	Well, I ripped out of my John the fourth spine and I landed in my daddy's spine.
1988400	1995440	But at the time he was kind of a semi brainwashed, you know, super soldier, half robot for an
1995440	1997360	evil crime Lord in the city.
1997360	2002560	You know, more or less my ball took over his body.
2002560	2003920	That is your brother's body.
2003920	2004800	I'm your nephew.
2006320	2007680	You know, you got to laugh.
2007680	2010080	And well, I'm technically his dad.
2010080	2010800	Hey, that's right.
2011520	2012080	Screw you.
2014400	2017040	I guess it's, I guess it's just the terminology that I was hung up on.
2017040	2022800	Like just then you just said things like landed in and became, but you ripped out the spine
2022800	2024960	of a person and put yourself into their place.
2024960	2029920	That's just a little more violent than I'd ever been picturing before, but I guess you
2029920	2030720	haven't done it to me.
2030720	2040080	So John Lee, Kevin Moore, like is just looking dead at Clark.
2040080	2044320	And he thinks at first that he's looking like the eye, but then he realizes he's looking
2044320	2045040	right at his neck.
2047280	2048240	Oh gosh.
2048240	2051120	It's like, no, no, I never have done that to you Clark.
2051120	2051920	And I never will.
2051920	2057200	You got, you got a skinny little neck and he kind of like touches his tongue as he sees
2057200	2058560	the thick neck of Keith.
2060880	2070160	Keith Vigna like tries to kind of sink his neck, make it shorter, like a little turtle.
2071920	2075920	Keith Vigna, are you turtley enough for the turtle club?
2075920	2076560	Turtle.
2076560	2077120	Turtle.
2077120	2078080	What's the turtle club?
2078080	2079520	Is that a weird looking penis thing?
2081680	2082720	Is that about wieners?
2082720	2083680	Yeah, that a wiener thing?
2083680	2085920	That's about it's about, yeah.
2085920	2087040	That's about beans.
2087040	2088320	That's about your dinger.
2088320	2089920	I'll show you a dinger.
2089920	2091120	I always say a little ding-a-ling.
2092480	2094240	Let's go across this bridge.
2094240	2097200	What I've been saying, but y'all wanted to know about spies.
2097760	2099520	I think, I think my point still stands.
2099520	2102560	We don't know the motives of this Julie ball.
2102560	2103360	Just keep an eye out.
2103360	2104880	Just keep, keep a head on a swivel.
2104880	2108640	Yeah, obviously we're looking out for bad guys, but like.
2108640	2109920	When y'all are saying ball.
2111440	2113120	What kind of point is that Clark?
2113120	2118720	That we don't, oh, let's stay in these two, two rooms forever with the weird lady who
2118720	2119920	fucks her cat man.
2119920	2126000	Because like maybe something's out there that might wish us ill and like the last five days
2126000	2126720	of our lives.
2126720	2127280	Come on, man.
2127280	2131280	To be honest, I'm just wondering why we're not taking the boat and trying to get farther
2131280	2133920	away from this area that we know that Julie's in.
2133920	2138320	Oh, you mean that boat into the endless ocean until the, instead of like the bridge to the
2138320	2139920	only other structure we can see?
2139920	2141920	Don and Jack, you guys came from somewhere.
2141920	2143280	You had to have, you got a boat.
2144080	2145520	Let's just go back there.
2145520	2150000	It's been a long time since we've seen a structure, right?
2150000	2153040	I've been looking for the door out of here, right?
2153680	2156240	Don here came for another reason.
2156240	2157520	He's not trying to get out.
2157520	2158240	How'd you come?
2158240	2160480	Don, you're not trying to leave this place?
2160480	2164640	I came purposefully to this place to, uh, to find something.
2165280	2166240	Find what?
2166240	2168320	What, your goddamn sense of decency?
2168320	2171360	So you could go back and spend more money on my race car buckle?
2171600	2174560	God damn.
2175600	2177200	That is such a bird.
2177200	2178720	That was a long time ago, boy.
2179520	2185280	Well, I'm honestly like, like what does this fucking, you know, criminal piece of shit.
2186080	2188880	What purpose does he have in a mystical world of goo?
2189840	2191680	Like what quest do you seek?
2191680	2196240	You, I thought you to be frankly, a very shallow piece of shit individual.
2196240	2200720	So I just wonder what greater purpose you might be out here for.
2201440	2205520	Again, you were in my top four uncles, but like, you know how low that bar was.
2205520	2206640	You know I raised you.
2207360	2210560	I did the best I could sometimes.
2211280	2213120	I had big things I had to do.
2213840	2219520	I had important jobs to do in contention for very powerful people.
2220080	2223120	And I'm here to undo some of the harm that I've done.
2223920	2224420	Okay.
2225280	2227040	Why don't you expand on that?
2227920	2231600	How the fuck is anything you're doing here in this goo world turning things right?
2232240	2234480	John, I had, I used that bag.
2234480	2234880	Yeah.
2234880	2236640	We know about the bag.
2236640	2238000	Where'd you get the bag?
2238000	2239760	Let's just, where'd you get the bag?
2239760	2241600	He said he's always had it.
2241600	2243200	That's always been my mission.
2243200	2245280	We knew that bag is agent Victor's bag.
2245280	2246640	You couldn't have always had it.
2246640	2248080	We had it in fact, for a little bit.
2248800	2250080	I am agent Victor.
2251200	2251700	What?
2252240	2256320	Does that, do you know, do you know McKinley and Kennedy and?
2257040	2259200	The other one, much more important.
2259200	2260720	Do you know Kevin?
2261280	2262720	Do you know K cell?
2262720	2264160	I can't say I do.
2264160	2267280	Primarily worked alone, getting rid of items.
2267280	2269760	That's what the bag is for.
2269760	2276960	It's to get rid of things and make sure they don't ever come back to where we are, where we were.
2276960	2284240	Well, it seems like there's, you know, there's a few more portals between our world and the goo
2284960	2286800	than just this fucking bag.
2287280	2288640	I started figuring that out.
2288640	2291840	Cause I've been talking to Jack Russell for, I don't know.
2291840	2294240	God, I don't fucking know how long.
2294240	2295440	So long, mate.
2295440	2297920	Is this your first time that going into the bag?
2297920	2301120	Yeah, I didn't, I didn't know what was going to happen.
2301120	2303520	Why'd you go into the bag?
2303520	2304880	John, I did some bad things.
2304880	2310960	I'm not proud of one of the first things that really started bugging me about all this,
2310960	2314560	this business is I put a person in the bag.
2314880	2318160	It was only objects for a long time, but who did you put in?
2318160	2322400	Their name was, was, was Thomas, Thomas Lewis.
2322400	2327920	I believe they were an activist and they started coming down with some disease.
2328720	2334560	The organization I work for told me they'd seen this before and they needed to get rid of it.
2335120	2336080	Right then and there.
2336080	2337200	Just following orders.
2337200	2341120	Uncle, in my experience, people named Thomas are decent and good.
2341120	2342800	And you should have given them more of a shot.
2343760	2344880	That's neither here nor there.
2346880	2349360	So you think we're all in the bag right now?
2349360	2350160	I don't know.
2350160	2351840	But if you want to know why I'm here.
2351840	2353120	Yeah, let him keep talking.
2357120	2359920	I bet there's more to the story you'd want to hear about.
2360720	2362800	Yeah, let him keep talking.
2365760	2367760	Jack Russell's like rubbing my shoulder.
2371200	2372320	Go on, tell him more.
2373760	2374880	Who was he?
2374880	2375680	What was he like?
2375680	2376400	What did he do?
2378560	2380080	And now I'm talking like this.
2381440	2381760	All right.
2383040	2385360	Nobody asked you about fucking Thomas.
2385360	2387760	We just said, treat Thomas as nicer.
2387760	2391920	I asked you, did you jump in the bag and do you think we're in here?
2391920	2396240	And then Jack was like, yeah, tell him more about Thomas.
2397680	2398800	That's not what I asked.
2398800	2399840	So can we just.
2399840	2404800	I think it's maybe the third time that he would have to establish that he got into the bag.
2404800	2406080	And that's why he's here.
2407520	2409520	I didn't ask them to reestablish that.
2409520	2409840	I just.
2411600	2412480	This is the bag?
2415120	2416000	Whatever you want.
2416000	2416960	Yeah, reestablish.
2416960	2418320	I know it's confusing.
2418320	2420320	It's confusing to all of us, mate.
2420320	2422160	It's confusing to everyone.
2422160	2422880	We don't fucking.
2422880	2424160	You don't fuck here from London.
2424160	2425440	Look at that sky.
2425440	2427600	Is it a blue dress or a silver dress?
2427600	2429200	Is it black or is it colorful?
2429200	2430080	I don't fucking know.
2430080	2431520	Is it Yanny or Laurel?
2431520	2432960	Goddamn, I hate you.
2432960	2433600	I'll hate you.
2434160	2436960	I just absolutely hate you because you've got me.
2436960	2438480	John, why are you talking like that?
2438480	2440320	It's some strange effect of this world.
2441040	2441600	Hold on.
2443040	2444160	Corn flakes.
2444160	2445680	All right, go fuck yourself.
2449360	2453280	Now I've lost track of where we are, but I want that British fellow to stop talking.
2453280	2454960	So John, here's the thing.
2454960	2458400	John, you asked him why he got in the bag and he said, well, to explain that, I'll have to go back
2458400	2460320	farther and started telling us about Thomas Lewis.
2460320	2464160	So let's just let him catch up to why he got into the bag by telling the story of Thomas Lewis.
2464880	2465440	Thank you.
2466080	2466480	All right.
2466480	2466800	All right.
2471040	2471680	All right.
2471680	2472240	All right.
2472240	2472800	All right.
2473520	2474480	Now, John.
2474480	2475200	You got more?
2475200	2477360	You just want to get your last little bit in there?
2478960	2480640	He's going to resist saying yeah.
2481520	2482080	All right.
2482080	2482320	Yeah.
2484640	2488160	You see, people can sound like all kinds of shit and they can make you feel shitty too.
2488880	2492720	I just said I don't want to hear another goddamn word out of that British feller.
2492720	2493680	And Jack Russell?
2494400	2497760	If that is your fucking name, I'd like you to respect that for a second.
2497760	2498720	I'm talking to my uncle.
2499600	2500720	Now, Don.
2502400	2503920	Please continue.
2503920	2511120	So this Thomas Lewis was an activist against this William Beanes fella.
2511120	2514640	Some kind of tech genius or some billionaire.
2514640	2515520	I don't know.
2515520	2517520	What, some kind of Martin Cupertino?
2517520	2518960	That was my daddy.
2518960	2521120	Your daddy was Martin Cupertino?
2521120	2522080	No, Beanes.
2523840	2528240	You're throwing confusion bombs into this conversation like a terrorist.
2531040	2532880	You don't even know who Martin Cupertino is.
2533520	2534160	First of all.
2534160	2536320	Oh, you do know who Martin Cupertino is?
2536320	2537440	He's a very famous man.
2537440	2538160	Very famous man.
2538880	2541120	It was a very astute character moment.
2542000	2543760	You don't even know who Steve Jobs is.
2543760	2545040	Does he exist in this world?
2545040	2547040	I'm pretty sure his name is Martin Cupertino.
2548400	2548900	Yeah.
2551760	2552400	Holy shit.
2554400	2556640	This Thomas Lewis, they were an activist.
2556640	2557280	They were young.
2558160	2562640	It was the first time I'd been ordered to put a person into the bag.
2562640	2565920	The bag is supposed to be for items, not for people.
2565920	2567920	I put them in here.
2567920	2568800	Who knows what happened?
2568800	2570560	They may have drowned in that metal sea.
2570560	2573840	I don't know, but that, that didn't even where it all ends.
2573840	2577280	The madness virus, it seemed to be stopped at that point.
2577280	2580000	But it was, I was never quite the same.
2580000	2582400	One of the items I ended up having to put in later.
2583040	2584160	You're not going to believe it.
2584160	2587200	It's a, it just looks like a rotary phone.
2587200	2587840	Like a road.
2587840	2590960	Have you, have y'all seen a rotary phone around here?
2591520	2592720	No, we're Gen Z.
2594480	2596000	You're Jan Z.
2596000	2597200	We're Gen Z.
2597200	2598480	We don't know what that is.
2601280	2604640	That phone might be able to heal everything.
2605520	2607360	They told me to get rid of this phone.
2607360	2608800	Why'd they want to get rid of it?
2608800	2615120	Because no one should have access to any of these magical doodads and items and whatnot.
2615680	2621440	But after I put that phone in the bag, I knew I made the world a worse place by putting
2621440	2622320	that phone in there.
2623440	2628560	And I, and I thought to myself, could I help Thomas if I, if I had that phone?
2628560	2633040	Maybe I could have prevented all this and maybe I could heal the world.
2633040	2636000	Maybe I can, maybe I can use it to heal us right now.
2636000	2637120	Even get us out of here.
2637120	2640000	I don't know, but I know I need to find it.
2640000	2641440	What's the phone number for it?
2644640	2645840	Have you tried calling it?
2645840	2646080	Yeah.
2647680	2649520	Yeah, it seems pretty simple.
2649520	2652960	I don't think that's how it works, but let's, let's give it a shot.
2652960	2654160	Do you know the number?
2655200	2656320	Have you even tried?
2656960	2657920	Yeah, I do.
2658640	2659840	Why don't we just give it a call?
2659840	2662720	Let's see who answers.
2662720	2664880	Do phones work here?
2664880	2666640	There's only one in the room.
2666640	2670400	Keith, you got, uh, you still got, you still got yours on you?
2670400	2673760	Well, it's actually right here and I pull it out.
2674960	2677440	Beep, beep, beep, boop, beep, bop, boop, boop.
2678800	2680240	That's me plugging in the numbers.
2680240	2681360	Why are you making that noise?
2685120	2689520	Yeah, Keith, Keith, that's, that's really, you just need to dial the numbers.
2689600	2691680	Please don't, please don't say boop.
2691680	2693440	Hey Siri, beep, beep, boop, boop.
2693440	2695760	I guess I take the phone from him and I dial the number.
2697200	2700320	And I'm making beep boop sounds as he's doing it.
2703120	2704160	I'm sorry, uncle Don.
2704160	2705360	He just does that every time.
2705920	2707200	You got weird new friends.
2707840	2709280	They're not friends or coworkers.
2709280	2709840	We're friends.
2711040	2719440	Across the rope bridge, outside of this John made hole in the wall of this Leo piston
2719760	2726960	junkyard bunker, seemingly coming from inside the stilted bunker across the way.
2728640	2732480	You hear a woman's voice going bring, bring
2735840	2738320	the standard sound of all phones I've ever heard.
2738880	2742560	Yeah, clearly the sound of this rotary phone.
2743120	2745600	There's absolutely nothing out of the ordinary with that.
2747280	2748160	The phone's over there.
2749600	2750400	It's Claire's day.
2751280	2756960	I picture you putting tons of echo effect on Taylor's bring, bring off in the distance,
2761360	2766000	but also somehow muffled metallic reverberations.
2766000	2771760	It's inside of that other, I honestly wanted, I thought you wanted us to picture like a woman
2774080	2777600	pretending to ring like a phone from like over there.
2777680	2779200	And we were just fooled by it.
2779200	2780480	Pretending to be phones.
2780480	2781440	Pretending to be phones.
2781440	2782160	God damn it.
2786160	2789360	I think Don would, wait, can I get through that hole?
2789360	2790080	Oh yeah.
2790080	2790960	Wait, who did you answer?
2790960	2791460	Oh yeah.
2792880	2795040	What did, what did, what did Luke say?
2795040	2796800	I said, I'm going to go towards the ringing.
2796800	2798400	Whose dexterity is higher?
2798400	2800720	Mine is 11.
2800720	2802240	Mine is 12.
2802240	2806560	John has pushed an arm back real quick, like holding Clark back and he's like,
2806560	2809280	why don't we just see what happens with these fellers?
2809280	2810480	Clark is totally fine with that.
2810480	2813040	He wasn't even jumping at the bit to get out that door.
2813040	2813760	No, I'll go.
2814400	2815840	So he's last.
2815840	2819920	So it'll go Keith, then Don, then Jack.
2819920	2823200	And the three of them run out onto the rope bridge.
2824160	2829040	I assume that John and Clark are peeking their head out of this John made hole.
2830000	2836240	And you all see, not the Bay boat that Don and Jack arrived on, but a new boat.
2836560	2840000	Also made of this inky colorful darkness.
2840000	2845840	And this boat has been written on with this shimmering sea.
2847440	2851600	Numbers cover the entire hull of the boat.
2852240	2859760	And it says one, five, two, two, five, one, eight, one, nine, five, five, one, eight.
2859760	2863360	Which you know to mean oversea.
2864320	2866560	God damn it, Clark.
2866560	2868080	It's one of your things.
2868080	2871280	There are some things that are happening currently.
2872080	2875120	Do you guys know what the figurehead of a boat is?
2875760	2876480	Yes.
2876480	2878160	Is it like the naked lady?
2878160	2878800	It is.
2878800	2888560	But in this case, it's a young man with curly black hair and you all see Don's face shine
2888640	2889920	with recognition.
2890640	2898880	Because even without his glasses, Don recognizes Thomas Lewis, the activist who is anti-William
2898880	2902080	Beans, still technically alive.
2902080	2909200	His mouth is completely steeled shut with the melting silver shimmering sea.
2909760	2912640	His silver mouth is closed.
2912640	2915840	His bottom half is in the water.
2916560	2923120	Continuously melting as he cries in absolutely horrendous pain.
2932400	2937040	At the front of the boat, you see twins.
2937600	2939280	And twins.
2940960	2941920	They are children.
2942640	2944080	Oh my God.
2944080	2945600	And kids.
2946400	2954320	Avery and Alice Little with a bowl cut and pigtails respectively, each with overalls
2954320	2962880	on, are standing at the front of this boat and behind them is Julie Maxwell wearing a
2962880	2964240	hospital gown.
2964240	2970160	She has a massive gash running down her forehead in between her eyes.
2970160	2977840	Her nose seems to be missing and she smiles at you all with no teeth or lips on one full
2977840	2979120	side of her face.
2979680	2988000	That side has an eye, but her other orbital socket is oozing with the dark substance.
2988000	2995920	And suddenly the body begins to crumple into the boat as a metallic ball rises above with
2995920	3003920	these silvery shining limbs reaching out, one of which holds up the body of Julie Maxwell
3003920	3008720	away from the steel shimmering water below this boat.
3008720	3019040	And the other tendril reaches out and rips at the bridge that Dawn, Keith, and Jack are
3019040	3020560	currently standing on.
3020560	3022400	Oh no.
3022400	3023040	That ain't good.
3023040	3026560	Well, it's a good thing they showed up right when we started to cross the bridge instead
3026560	3029920	of when we were well across it, because you fellas just get inside.
3029920	3031680	Let's all just come back inside.
3031680	3032560	We'll be fine.
3032560	3036320	Hey, I'm trying to hide my face from those kids and Clark, you should too, so they don't
3036320	3036960	recognize us.
3053760	3062800	I'm on the borderline, leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing
3062800	3063760	it every time.
3063760	3069760	Tell me what kind of world are you living in?
3072560	3077760	What kind of world are you living in?
3083040	3105760	What kind of world are you living in?
3105760	3111760	What kind of world are you living in?
3113760	3115760	What kind of world are you living in?
3115760	3117760	What kind of world are you living in?
