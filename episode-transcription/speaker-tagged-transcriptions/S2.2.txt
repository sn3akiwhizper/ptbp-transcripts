0.00 224.00 speaker0  What's good, the internet. It is your web-savvy zaddy, Wolf the Dog. Net. And we're coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station powered by Geocities. Now, speaking of the World Wide Web and all of the beauty contained within, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Gary in Scarborough, England, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod, which is a thing you are also more than welcome to do. Gary writes, Howdy, Wolf. It's your brother and long-time listener from across the pond. I hope this finds you well and know that you should come here to Scarborough, Wolfie. That's if you don't mind fighting off mutant-sized seagulls up at the castle for that extra tasty grease you love oh so much. I hear it will make you howl so hard you taste colors. Anyway, I love the podcast that you, Zach, and the boys are providing for us folks. Keep up the great work and a big shout-out to my girlfriend, Mel, and my buddy, Paul. If you want to write up something for your Web 2.0 Wolf to Howl, tag at PretendingPod on Twitter or Instagram, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write a five-star review and send us that screenshot. Word of mouth through social media has been instrumental in getting this podcast to where it is today. And I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, fuck Mark Zuckerberg. If you, too, have these feelings, you may find a nice community to join in our Discord or subreddit. And if you want to give us money so we don't stop making this show, you can do that on Patreon or our merch shop. The links are in the show notes. Now, it's time to catch up, but don't get confused. Wolf don't work for Can, but it's time for the news. Last time, we were introduced to Julius Summers, the fresh-faced, thick-legged field producer who was just hired by his uncle, Typh Rayland, Julius picked up the former lead anchor of Can, Cal Colorado, an elderly statesman of news in the city, as well as their Hawaiian shirt-rocking cameraman, Beck Wilder. The three put together a segment about the Godel Company, top of the agricultural food chain, buying up all the farmland just outside the city, taking us now to that story as it unfolds. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.
220.00 234.00 speaker1  I had the Kelly Clarkson Hazel Eyes song stuck in my head. Do you remember that Guitar Hero 2 song that was like,
232.00 294.00 speaker2  No, what are the radium girls? I do know about them. it was kind of a craze to put radium in shit, including makeup. But they were not fine while they were still alive because their fucking jaws fell off because of the radium paint and the watch dials, right?
292.00 302.00 speaker1  because they kind of glowed. They called the radium girls, they were like angels.
299.00 305.00 speaker2  Talk about unachievable beauty standards, you know what I mean? That radium glow?
303.00 309.00 speaker1  Truly, truly unattainable.
307.00 310.00 speaker2  I'm sorry, you photoshop your what?
309.00 319.00 speaker1  My porn?
317.00 328.00 speaker2  Oh, okay. Ask the answer. There's a book called The Radium Girls,
326.00 338.00 speaker1  Is it erotica? It is for me. but it had an early Joey King in it. Who? In 2018.
336.00 353.00 speaker2  The guy from Kingaroo Jack, I think. Kingaroo Jack.
351.00 381.00 speaker1  and just like the vibe they give off. patterned shirts but mostly Hawaiian shirts. Beck Wilder. He obviously doesn't care a whole lot about his appearance. His outward appearance is almost buffoonery.
379.00 384.00 speaker2  Oh, you had mentioned his shorts as well. He's got confident shorts.
383.00 407.00 speaker1  He's got the cargoiest of shorts. Yeah, he's got a craftsman's shorts. We're talking loops. We're talking pockets. So many pockets, dude. Oh, my God. He's lost things in there before. He's thought about going full pants just to have more space for pockets, but he just loves the breeze on his calves. He needs to look into those zip-offs.
406.00 414.00 speaker2  Oh, he does.
413.00 418.00 speaker1  That's the thing that Beck would definitely do. That's forward thinking.
415.00 427.00 speaker2  Know yourself, Beck Wilder. No.
426.00 430.00 speaker1  I hadn't thought about that, but that's good.
429.00 454.00 speaker2  A hard no. A hard no. Sorry, listeners, because Joe just shut off the National Lampoon's Wilder world. Write that down for us. Right, but our ride, he does call Van Wilder. That's what he calls his sweet Krieger van that he has.
450.00 459.00 speaker1  Beck, who's the person that you interact with most?
458.00 466.00 speaker2  His mom.
465.00 484.00 speaker1  Yep. It sure does seem like a thing I should have thought of. I like Boy Wilder. Not really.
481.00 486.00 speaker2  You said we are loners and don't know us little person. Yeah, we're weird.
485.00 495.00 speaker1  No bonds. No friends. No gods. No family. No kings.
490.00 530.00 speaker2  In our former lives, we were only friends with each other, and so we haven't gotten to that point yet. answer is Beck. Just a different three-letter name. Kim Wilder is your mom, and what kind of relationship do you have with Kim?
527.00 537.00 speaker1  He doesn't like his mom a whole lot.
535.00 554.00 speaker2  Joe. My phone was not on silent. That's true. I got the ticket thing. It's exceedingly decent here. That actually, that shit.
553.00 559.00 speaker1  It's so sick.
555.00 561.00 speaker2  It's a movie pass type deal, and I hope it doesn't mean that Alamo is about to go under grade.
560.00 565.00 speaker1  It is.
561.00 568.00 speaker2  The second they weren't making that delicious cold brew anymore, I knew that it was...
565.00 574.00 speaker1  Man, their menu is so parsed down now. Luke can't get his Italian sodas.
570.00 580.00 speaker2  I can't get my fucking cream soda. I will say, dude, past two times I've been, horrible service.
579.00 585.00 speaker1  Oh, bummer. Dude, I literally, I went and saw Top Gun.
584.00 588.00 speaker2  Oh, shit. Like almost the end of the night. Oh, that sucks.
587.00 590.00 speaker1  That's awful.
589.00 595.00 speaker2  Cold fried cauliflower. Counterpoint, I had great service the last time I went.
592.00 602.00 speaker1  Well, they've added that button, which I feel like now I get immediate service. Oh, the thing is Luke didn't press the button for an hour and a half.
599.00 610.00 speaker2  No, I literally got there early, ordered it, and then... Oh, you got there too early. No, I got there, I was probably one of the last people to do that. Luke, we're pretty sure this is something you did.
608.00 617.00 speaker1  We are really trying to turn this around on you, aren't you? Hey, Luke, I'm sorry that happened to you.
613.00 620.00 speaker2  It was a full, I didn't, I wasn't even that mad because it was a full theater, two servers for the whole thing. Oh, yeah, that's hard.
619.00 624.00 speaker1  That is hard.
623.00 655.00 speaker2  at going there. You don't know what you're doing. I'll have to look up tips and tricks, I guess. Tips and tricks. Beck Wilder has an iffy relationship with his mother, Kim Wilder. Let's talk a little bit about Julia Summers. Wait, real quick. She's a... Make her hot.
654.00 665.00 speaker1  No, she's a... Make her so hot. She's a far side woman with the beehive and the cat eye glasses.
663.00 666.00 speaker2  Does she have a fat lip?
665.00 675.00 speaker1  Fat lip.
673.00 733.00 speaker2  Wait, what is the fat lip reference? So, The Far Side, which is a rap group, hip-hop. Uh, with a C-Y. Not the classic single panel cartoon by Gary Lawson. Fat lip. Nice. Julia Summers. Julia is walking into the party like his name is... I don't know that. No, it's a fat lip reference. Some 41. Plus 44? No, some 41. Quick rundown on Julia Summers. You look at him at a glance. 5'6". Monochromatic suit. Depending on the day of the week, tan, black, grey, blue. Short king. Short king, big thighs. How tall is he? 5'6". Is that short? Sorry. That's about how tall I am. It's a poor one.
732.00 740.00 speaker1  No, you're like...
739.00 775.00 speaker2  I think you're taller than me too. Yeah, I think you're taller than that. Go back, if you're new to listening to this, go back on our social media. of this. We have all of our mug shots on there. Yeah.
774.00 786.00 speaker3  Anyway. Julie Summers, monochromatic suits. Lives in the suburbs outside of the city with his roommate.
785.00 797.00 speaker2  Oh, sick. Who's his roommate? He moved to this house.
796.00 800.00 speaker3  Her name? He hasn't found it out yet. Named her yet.
799.00 821.00 speaker2  He just moved in. Julie Summers, producer. Not good with names. Nephew of my uncle. the first thing we say instead of the last when we're meeting people.
818.00 831.00 speaker1  I always say, I've been Joe Terry. This has been Joe Terry.
830.00 833.00 speaker2  Hey, what's your name?
831.00 835.00 speaker3  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
833.00 864.00 speaker2  Let me describe what I look like first. Tife Rayland is your uncle and he is the executive producer of the City Action News. He is, how would you describe him? I'd say darn good at his job.
862.00 872.00 speaker3  You know, he is also my uncle's. I don't think I can say anything bad.
871.00 917.00 speaker2  Go to the farm. And then he also asked you to do one more thing. I think he said it twice and he said, you definitely need to remember to do this. Hold on, Zach. This is not in my notes, which doesn't mean anything on its own. But Joe made a face at that. And it's not in his notes, which means. Okay.
916.00 926.00 speaker3  You did.
924.00 935.00 speaker2  But that's Luke trying to remember.
934.00 954.00 speaker1  Here's the deal. Whatever I rolled, I think. Are you scared?
952.00 1037.00 speaker2  I think you failed. Let's go to Cal, Colorado. Handsome at any age. That's why he's on TV. He wears, um, Julius mentioned that a lot of his suits he inherited from his dad and they have nineties cuts. Cal has the exact same cuts. Do you guys match? Wait, how tall are you? I think he's like 6'3". Go huge. I am 9 feet tall and 400 pounds. My voice shakes the glass when I speak. Yeah, 6'3", average height.
1035.00 1048.00 speaker1  Average height in the NBA.
1043.00 1066.00 speaker2  Cal was great on his college basketball team, but he didn't have the stuff to go pro. He always thought if he had three extra inches, he might have been able to do that. But he was pretty happy with his career until now. Did he go to City State U? He went to the University of Missouri School of Journalism.
1065.00 1067.00 speaker3  The journalism school?
1066.00 1069.00 speaker2  Hell yeah.
1067.00 1078.00 speaker1  Who is Cal Colorado's closest human contact?
1073.00 1092.00 speaker2  Julius just got here, but we've been out on these segments for a few months now, I think. Cool. Carol Colorado.
1089.00 1111.00 speaker1  but just to throw it out there, I think that we said that you and I get along pretty well. Like, even though I'm kind of the opposite of everything you are.
1107.00 1135.00 speaker2  So he really appreciates the tech guys who get shit done. Sure. Does he consider Beck like a magician? Fix my phone for me.
1134.00 1139.00 speaker3  Do I have games on this?
1137.00 1142.00 speaker1  What's your relationship like with your daughter?
1140.00 1154.00 speaker2  It's strained, and we'll leave it at that. In a city? Yeah. You live in the city. The city.
1153.00 1171.00 speaker1  Yeah, we live in the city. Awesome.
1170.00 1173.00 speaker3  Spilling. I think this is spilling. We're tighty-whities.
1172.00 1183.00 speaker2  You're an excellent interviewer. Kravitsian. Thank you. No, you couldn't-
1182.00 1185.00 speaker1  Not visible from behind. Correct.
1184.00 1190.00 speaker2  Oh, right. No thigh gap. But only because he has those crazy thighs.
1189.00 1199.00 speaker3  Wait. Yeah. Mm-hmm. To be dick-sized. With a hyphen.
1198.00 1205.00 speaker2  I'm cutting all this.
1204.00 1211.00 speaker3  Beck doesn't have one. I'm taking it off.
1210.00 1234.00 speaker1  Get that thing off of it. and it sounded like we had what we needed.
1232.00 1237.00 speaker2  I think it's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1235.00 1264.00 speaker1  It's time to turn the segment into the studio. It's time to turn the segment into the studio. You guys are- It's time to turn the segment into the studio? It's time to turn the segment into the studio.
1261.00 1280.00 speaker2  It's time to turn the segment into the studio. What's a building look like? What's a building look like? Cool. It's like marble and glass. Yeah. Marble countertops.
1279.00 1282.00 speaker3  Literally marble and glass.
1281.00 1295.00 speaker2  Ooh. We are hemorrhaging money. We spent way too much money on this building.
1289.00 1304.00 speaker3  the walkway to the door is kind of like a winding thing with marbles in it.
1298.00 1322.00 speaker2  because we've already had so many slip and falls and threats of library. They're shiny. Humps.
1318.00 1339.00 speaker3  Julius shakes his head and reminisces about his time.
1338.00 1347.00 speaker2  Pick it up.
1342.00 1356.00 speaker3  and he picks it up, and he puts it in the little pocket in his pants. You know the little pocket? Yo, I'm aware of the little pocket.
1355.00 1409.00 speaker2  Sentimentally. Let's dive on into... Dive on in. That's not a dive. Luke, you're the producer. You're in charge here. You know that this segment needs to go into the editing bay, and the executive producer, your uncle, Tyfe, is likely in his office where he normally is, and you would imagine that the standard CAN news crew, which is the anchor weather person and sports segment host.
1407.00 1419.00 speaker1  I got the footage. You knew what I meant. How old are you guys? Sorry. I'm 29. Awesome.
1418.00 1425.00 speaker2  It's not tape, boomer.
1422.00 1442.00 speaker3  but Julius totally was thinking of like a VHS tape. Let's go to the bay. Yeah, I'll get it loaded up. And then I don't move, and I'm kind of waiting for him to like hopefully go to where the bay is because I don't know where it is.
1441.00 1448.00 speaker1  Yeah. He's here a lot.
1444.00 1462.00 speaker2  And yeah, you pop in, and the editor is hard at work,
1461.00 1467.00 speaker3  You're going to want to see this. Her name is... Vivica.
1466.00 1473.00 speaker1  Oh, her name? Her name? Oh, you're asking me? Her name? An NPC.
1471.00 1475.00 speaker2  Vivica Johnston, obviously. There you go.
1474.00 1480.00 speaker1  Vivica. Hey, Viv, got that footage for you. Oh, thank you, thank you. Oh, my goodness.
1479.00 1488.00 speaker2  Okay, let's get going, let's get going. Do we need to cut a bunch, or is it mostly good to go?
1486.00 1527.00 speaker1  you guys have seen, the audience hasn't seen, that he kind of almost flips a switch at this point and is almost robotic and able to relay to her at three minutes and 33 seconds. We've got a footage of the corn at four minutes and 56 seconds is when the interview starts. It ends at 593. He's just running down a list from memory Oh, and the crabs. Wait, Julius?
1524.00 1542.00 speaker2  And then landing perfectly on his feet. I mean, yeah, dude, you're probably deep in some nostalgia here. It's weird. I know that feeling. The smell. The marble floors of your youth.
1541.00 1548.00 speaker1  Ooh. Smell that marble. Ooh, that smell.
1547.00 1562.00 speaker2  Very cool. Vivica gets going and is just at the exact pace of your notes. It's cracking the fuck out of this edit. She is on like seven monitors at the same time.
1561.00 1567.00 speaker1  Yes.
1566.00 1569.00 speaker2  Oh, absolutely.
1567.00 1575.00 speaker1  Cannes is city action news.
1572.00 1579.00 speaker3  the see-through dry erase board that you can totally get right on both sides of. Oh, my God.
1578.00 1601.00 speaker2  Nice. is lined up in that three-quarter slot. It's not right at the top, but it's safely nuzzled in.
1598.00 1608.00 speaker3  like stay tuned for the farm thing. Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
1606.00 1621.00 speaker2  She turns back to you and she says, okay, do we want to keep any of this passion and bleep it or are we just cutting all that? We're going to keep and bleep
1619.00 1627.00 speaker3  Oh, that's good.
1624.00 1654.00 speaker2  that's like really intense with this. There's some image that's like blurred in the background that looks tense, some sort of discordant scene happening behind words that ominously say viewer discretion is advised.
1651.00 1663.00 speaker3  aren't you going to stay tuned until you see what the crab man is?
1662.00 1715.00 speaker2  Fucking rad. We just put this thing together and then we are ready to go. When you show the end result to Cal Colorado, Yeah, Cal comes in and he watches the segment and he sees that shot that didn't really have to be there. I'm sorry, I need to use the restroom. the anchor and the sports person and the weather person, all kind of laughing in a huddle.
1712.00 1723.00 speaker1  Oh, no, man.
1719.00 1731.00 speaker3  90% angry and 10% a little just sad.
1730.00 1742.00 speaker1  Oof.
1740.00 1752.00 speaker2  She says to the producer and holds out her hand. She says, Vivica Johnston.
1748.00 1756.00 speaker3  but if I'm not here, there's always a shot at Cal.
1754.00 1767.00 speaker1  I think Beck swells with a little bit of pride to hear that. He's happy to hear that.
1764.00 1773.00 speaker4  Isn't it nap time?
1772.00 1795.00 speaker2  A chicken with its head cut off? Man, I really didn't want to say that, huh? That's right. There's a young man with his head cut off running around outside,
1792.00 1805.00 speaker1  screaming, wait, how? Such a good horror podcast.
1804.00 1815.00 speaker2  Oops, not yet.
1814.00 1838.00 speaker1  I would too.
1837.00 1854.00 speaker4  Type what's Cal. So if you want to get up there fast, do you guys need anything? Coffee's busted.
1853.00 1888.00 speaker3  Oat milk latte? Oat milk latte? Yeah, there's a place about four blocks down. Sure. Iced hot. Okay, iced hot. Truly, I pop one open in the morning, bam, I'm ready to go.
1886.00 1927.00 speaker2  Right, the ingredients list, have you looked at it? You're a doctor. Oh. Wait. So, yeah, listeners, Zach, Joe, Luke, I lied about my credentials to get on this podcast. I am not a doctor.
1926.00 1997.00 speaker1  Where are those rails? Let's find them. Yeah, they're right in front of you. Stand by me-ing. You just hear... All right, see you in there, man.
1992.00 2020.00 speaker2  and then a smiling, beautiful Cal Colorado pops out, and you might notice his eyes are a little red, but probably not. Probably not. It looks like maybe he applied some makeup in there.
2018.00 2028.00 speaker3  You gotta learn how to deal with the talent, man.
2026.00 2046.00 speaker1  Beck is kind of giving you an open arm shrug.
2043.00 2055.00 speaker3  And then I look at Beck, like, shaking my head, like, was that good?
2054.00 2058.00 speaker1  but then immediately comes out.
2055.00 2087.00 speaker2  As soon as you pop out, Vivica Johnston, the editor, pops her head out of the bay and looks out to you and says, Cal! You got a really good one. He's not a Marvin, alright? Cal's head is clearly elsewhere, but he, he kind of blinks and collects himself and looks over at her and, like, gives her a thumbs up and, and pats Julius on the back.
2082.00 2097.00 speaker3  and he knows that as his last act, he had the marbles torn up from the walkway.
2094.00 2133.00 speaker2  Yeah, he's the only person that had managed to slip on the marbles. Vivica is a professional.
2130.00 2146.00 speaker3  because he's been gone there for a long time. He learned today.
2144.00 2148.00 speaker2  You're making our way up there.
2146.00 2155.00 speaker4  Walking past.
2152.00 2176.00 speaker2  This is my uncle. We're gonna talk to him. They're, uh, they're hanging out and just shooting the shit over some bagels. At Crafty? At the Craft Service. Craft Services, bruh. Craft Services is provided by Craft.
2175.00 2185.00 speaker1  It's sponsored by Craft. There's a vat of macaroni and cheese.
2183.00 2222.00 speaker3  Little smokies and mac and cheese.
2221.00 2234.00 speaker2  We were co-anchors for... Oh! Nice. She is just the lead. Nope, she has got it. And...
2233.00 2238.00 speaker1  Yeah.
2234.00 2296.00 speaker2  She really reminded Cal of his daughter, Carol. He thought he had taken her under his wing and really, like, mentored this person. Yeah. As you look at your team, you're kind of, like, beaming with pride. As you look back, her back is turned, and she is talking with the others.
2295.00 2350.00 speaker1  Julius. But you made sure to wait until she was all the way turned around.
2347.00 2414.00 speaker2  I think he said he wanted to butt fuck her. It is double-doored and Typh's door is closed. But these huge wooden doors are installed so that you understand what kind of office you're about to walk into. Hold on. What's happening?
2412.00 2468.00 speaker1  Is it State Farm? Not quite that.
2466.00 2469.00 speaker3  It was all of that.
2468.00 2501.00 speaker4  Oh, no.
2500.00 2516.00 speaker2  You're not a real Rayland. That's what we say, right? Mr. Rayland, could I just say that your nephew here has just performed. Yeah, come on, come on.
2515.00 2518.00 speaker1  I'm so glad that you're here, Cal.
2517.00 2584.00 speaker2  Sit down. Thank you. You were saying? I was saying that your nephew has performed admirably on his first assignment and that, Since you can see us through the glass, do we need these crazy knocks? He thinks about it. He's beaming with pride while he's staring at Julius and he's like, do we need the crazy knocks? I don't know. Summers. That is correct. Julius Summers. I mean, you're a nephew. Couldn't you just be his sister's son? I am his sister's son. He just deduced the fuck out of that. Oh, you must be his sister's son.
2582.00 2597.00 speaker3  It's just the fact that I do have a different last name.
2594.00 2628.00 speaker1  Beck is kind of getting stoked just off of his stokedness. Yeah. Now, I got something, ooh, I got something weird.
2627.00 2667.00 speaker2  So we got to send you out. And she said it's urgent, so we have to go right now. Typh, I know it's been a while since I've been in the anchor chair, she really seems like she's got something. She said she had a hot story just for Cal. Okay, what she said was that she can't call the cops, and that if we can get in there and get the story first, you see, then maybe we can run it before anybody else.
2665.00 2687.00 speaker3  What do you guys think about this? We go, if the story's true, we get good content. If it's false, we spin it into exposing the perverts of the city.
2685.00 2713.00 speaker1  but it sounds like a story to me. I've never seen such good-looking bait in my life, look at him!
2711.00 2769.00 speaker2  It's almost something more than that. He's looking confused at Julius and he's like, what more is there than journalism? It's the human condition.
2764.00 2798.00 speaker3  that the juice comes out of every part of that watermelon down to the last drop. And what we need to do is be my thighs and squeeze a story out of this phone call.
2794.00 2846.00 speaker2  It sounded like she was in a real situation, okay? Ty, if you told me when I switched from news desk to field reporter Points that would maybe get me back to my desk. If you hold up your end of the bargain, I will do this thing for you. He reaches out his hand.
2845.00 2859.00 speaker4  Get your hand in here.
2858.00 2889.00 speaker1  Yeah, do you feel it?
2888.00 2894.00 speaker4  What?
2893.00 2903.00 speaker2  Yeah.
2902.00 2910.00 speaker1  Yes. Yes. Cool.
2909.00 2914.00 speaker3  Six months.
2911.00 2921.00 speaker1  You were on a mission there getting us to an end place. You're so good at that Joe. I just was curious.
2918.00 2927.00 speaker2  It's not, it's not me or Luke. It's you. It's you.
2926.00 2946.00 speaker4  I want to have a baby with you. I want to get pregnant with you. Oh man. All right.
2943.00 2959.00 speaker1  Cause I wondered if there was a chance that Cal didn't even know, but he's been told that he's done now on a good point system to get back. yourself for yet or not.
2958.00 2969.00 speaker2  Sure. Um, and is just a scam. Oh, you're maybe not real. Exactly. Yeah. Like would he take this unscrupulous job to get back to his dream job?
2968.00 2979.00 speaker1  Yeah.
2974.00 3011.00 speaker2  been so long since he's been in the field, but he didn't even realize how like down and dirty, maybe typhon is his field boys were getting. And immediately you're stuck in traffic. You get a text from typh. It just says, I ain't seen no tick tock yet. Oh fuck. That is wow.
3009.00 3019.00 speaker3  You said that?
3017.00 3026.00 speaker1  Really good timing to bring it up.
3025.00 3057.00 speaker2  seen the text? Yes.
3055.00 3075.00 speaker1  I'm talking to Cal. engaged more or something. Like I'm not big on it myself, but I understand it. Have you ever like, um, popped and locked?
3072.00 3082.00 speaker2  Are you asking me if I've committed a robbery?
3081.00 3116.00 speaker1  a challenge? You know?
3115.00 3134.00 speaker2  I like it. Me too. You guys are like supporting each other and shit.
3128.00 3153.00 speaker3  But today I woke up missing me and it's been downhill from there.
3151.00 3290.00 speaker4  I don't recognize myself. What you did was a stinky thing to do. No cure for being freaking stupid. So take it or leave it. That's too bad. That's my least favorite time. Have a happy birthday old friend. I hope this isn't the end but if it is, it'll be alright. I just need you to fix it. I'm sick of waiting on someone to wait on me. Cause last time I missed it. If you tell me to get over it. It's not your business. I'll skip away into the sunset and whistle to the tune of it. This is my coming of age. This train don't have no brakes. Have a happy birthday old friend. I hope this isn't the end. It'll finally be alright. Cause my life is great and it's all my fault. Cause my life is great and it's all my fault. Cause my life is great and it's all my fault. Cause my life is wonderful and I blame it on me.
