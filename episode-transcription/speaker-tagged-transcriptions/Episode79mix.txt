0.00 141.70 speaker0  Welcome to the Bone Zone, my babies! It's your sexual guru, Walt the Dog, and I'm here to make sweet love to the radio airwaves live from 694.2 PTBP, Contentions' naughtiest radio station for hot Christian singles in your area. I'm starting to have those weird dreams again, y'all. The newest batch was wild. I went to the coffee shop in my dreamland and proceeded to ask for the oldest and stankiest grounds, as is my custom. The coffee attendant denied me my rightful treasures, so I started shaking them violently. little tiny baby wolf started pouring out my damn eyes. All the baby wolf started doing a dance and raised me up to the damn heavens, where I proceeded to become a god. And then my teeth fell out and I had sex with my dad. Wait, who is my dad? W-was I even birthed? If you can interpret anything from these, please reach out and be my Joseph. You know your Wolfie loves a coat of many colors. Seriously, what do these dreams mean? Or how about you write us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts with your analysis of my fancies. And maybe I'll read it on the show, like I'm now about to read this five-star review from Ram Oden. They write, I assume Wolf the dog will be there to catch us at the end. Much love, y'all are delightful. Thank you so much for putting this out. I listen to dozens of podcasts and this is one of two that puts the numbers in me on a weekly basis. I don't get to play as much as I'd like, responsibilities and all,

404.70 431.10 speaker3  a little cheesy, but I think the true PTBP fans are going to love what they just heard. Yeah. We're out. Thanks, guys. Thanks for listening. 79.
429.20 433.70 speaker2  I'm still having fun, though.
433.10 439.50 speaker3  Ditto.
437.80 448.00 speaker2  the whole time, then yes, I have been looking forward to it all day.
446.20 450.90 speaker3  If you want, we could just take it from here. Oh, yeah.
448.50 456.50 speaker2  If you could, I'd love to see that happen. Yeah.
451.90 465.40 speaker3  So guys, you're standing in front of the Goo God. Sure. OK. Also, this isn't your job anymore. Oh, shit.
464.60 468.00 speaker2  Sorry. Kick him out.
466.00 477.30 speaker3  So what you've deduced is that you just have to hurt its feelings, and you win. So if you can say something really hurtful about this Goo.
474.50 490.80 speaker2  You're just dang old jiggly is all you are. well.
489.20 495.30 speaker0  No. I'm a loner.
494.80 501.70 speaker3  It's working. It's working, guys. It looks like what else do you have?
497.60 511.40 speaker2  Hey, Goo, this new fella I met over here says that we look like brothers.
510.10 522.70 speaker3  He has a crush on you. You guys are really close to winning.
522.00 597.70 speaker2  I shoot it. taking turns, putting on this watch, and seeing a vision, and then the watch slipping off, and then putting it right on somebody else. I believe John Lee, Kevin Moore III just slapped it right on Clark Bishop. And then they were questioning John Lee. Pettymore was like, if I put it on again, will it be the same? But he asked it to the sky or something. And then Keith Wigner was like, well, I'll just do it. And so Keith Wigner slapped on the watch. His eyes come back to reality as the watch slips off into his other hand. It took me so long to catch what you said. I had to match the rhythm of his belly with my head. That's a DC Talk lyric. So just a lot of rap, this one, just a lot of rap lyrics on this one for sure. So Keith Wigner's got the watch, the throne, and I need everyone to roll sanity with your dice. Even me?
596.90 612.20 speaker3  I rolled a 2. 30 on a 15.
609.50 660.40 speaker2  as you lose one sanity, as does Keith Wigner. Keith Wigner, when this watch pops off, you just let out a little scream, which you realize in this moment is the only noise that you can hear because contention is wildly quiet compared to the last time you were here. If you'll remember, last time you heard lots of animals in the creek and in the ponds and such, that is echoing. And then you think it might even bounce off of that big floating moat and bounce back at you.
658.10 679.40 speaker3  That's where we're standing right now. I'm going to try and tackle Keith, and I'm yelling, OK. I'm going to, yeah, and I'm going to try to help Keith.
676.20 693.80 speaker2  All right, so you can roll to assist, and it'll give Keith a plus 20 on his roll.
692.50 718.20 speaker3  So what am I rolling? I rolled a 61 on a 70. Oh, I got you.
713.00 728.80 speaker2  but John Lee Pettymore tries to grab on to Keith Vigna to pull him out of the way and just literally just grab shirt. You're still wearing the massive polo, I believe?
728.10 730.10 speaker3  Oh, super tight.
728.80 739.80 speaker2  The polo's a little too small. Yeah, and so as you grab his shirt, it's so tight on his skin, you can't quite. And Clark Bishop.
737.30 752.50 speaker3  I tackle you, and I'm kind of like trying to pin you maybe to the ground, and I'm trying to get the watch out of your hand and get it away. And I'm just like maybe bashing your whole back into the ground.
750.70 759.10 speaker1  Why did you put it on again?
755.60 784.70 speaker2  I'm going to have you roll an unarmed combat or a strength the back of your neck and the back of your skull as he's just hitting you in the ground. But he does get a hold of the watch, and he throws it into the grass nearby.
783.50 792.50 speaker3  What are you doing? I just.
788.60 813.20 speaker4  into the ground a few times, my eyes kind of relax, and I stop maybe doing it quite as hard, but I'm still kind of jostling you. And then my hands are moving to your chest, and it's a little more like, I am, I am, I. away embarrassed, but doesn't say much.
811.30 821.50 speaker2  as Keith is on the ground. John is standing right next to you all with the watch in hand.
819.00 864.70 speaker3  after he sees that Clark is settling down and he puts the watch on.
860.60 927.60 speaker2  has still unsettling, but you know what you're getting into, and you're standing over a man's body, and he's face down in the dry crack dirt you've seen him before. The smell of piss. Same man. Yep, same man. The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air, and looking down the road to your perceived destination, you recognize your hometown of contention. Back to the body on the ground, your hands are trembling as you roll him over, a dead man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine, dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s, and a trifolded piece of parchment It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company, and it reads, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight. Plenty of work. Hesitate not.
924.60 943.90 speaker3  If I hadn't accidentally heard the end of the episode with Luke hearing that, it would have been a big reveal.
941.90 946.40 speaker2  and you see Keith Vigna.
945.30 956.40 speaker3  I had the wind knocked out of me, so I'm just trying to catch my breath and slowly get back up.
952.50 967.30 speaker4  Keith, I'm sorry. That watch is freaky. I don't know why you would willingly just put it back on.
964.80 994.20 speaker3  and I look over at John. You see the watch slipping off his hand, and he turns around with kind of a wide expression. Did you see the same thing? I mean, you remember the dead man and the vision? Yeah. This time, a note slipped out of his pocket. I saw the same thing.
991.30 998.40 speaker4  We used striking torches. Hesitate not, that one?
996.30 1012.70 speaker3  Yeah, it had the same sort of thing. it would sound like this.
1010.10 1028.30 speaker2  Readying torches, hesitate not. Readying untapped sight. Plenty of work.
1026.70 1032.90 speaker3  Yeah, I'm afraid I did.
1031.90 1037.30 speaker2  Clark, what do you see?
1035.60 1044.40 speaker3  Oh, OK.
1042.50 1049.10 speaker4  that he wouldn't be ready for it. He was already apologizing and embarrassed and talking to Keith.
1048.10 1062.10 speaker3  Sucker watch.
1059.80 1133.50 speaker2  but still unsettling way. And you're standing over a man's body face down in the dry cracked dirt. The smell of piss and shit wafts through the humid summer air. And looking down the road to your perceived destination, you recognize your hometown of contention. Back to the body on the ground, your hands are trembling as you roll him over a dead man in his mid-20s, stiff as a glass of moonshine, dressed in the fashion of the day, which is the late 1800s. And a trifolded piece of parchment falls out of the deceased man's jacket pocket. It's a job advertisement for the contention mining company. And it reads, we is hiring able bodies, readying untapped sight, plenty of work, hesitate not.
1131.10 1139.40 speaker3  Let's see how many of these fucking things Zach prepared.
1138.70 1151.40 speaker4  accidentally.
1148.20 1259.00 speaker2  All of a sudden, you're looking at Bean's pond. You see Tilde B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards away from you toward the water. She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood pond, and she continues in steadily until the water rises above her head. And when she is gone, the channel of your reality changes, and you are sitting at the bar in a tavern. Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection. Your eyes are wild. You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing from the dead body you found on the way into town. The barmaid refills your glass. You see your reflection. And you guys see? more than their sand?
1258.30 1260.40 speaker4  OK, bye.
1259.00 1272.70 speaker2  Take your headphones off, Luke. We're playing a closed game.
1271.80 1282.70 speaker0  I love it. Yeah.
1280.10 1292.30 speaker4  So we can see your faces with this new method. And Thomas's faces with whatever you were describing was great.
1289.00 1375.20 speaker2  You see Tildy B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards away from you toward the water. She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood pond. And as she continues in steadily, the water rises above her head. And when she's gone, the channel of your reality changes, and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern. Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection. Your eyes are wild. You recognize your thick hand-stitched clothing from the dead body you found on the way into town. The barmaid refills your glass. God damn it.
1373.60 1380.10 speaker3  OK.
1379.10 1388.10 speaker2  We will now, yeah.
1385.70 1392.90 speaker3  if, like, if we all hold hands, we can experience these visions at the same time. You know what?
1391.70 1483.20 speaker2  but it sure would help. You see Tildi B. Mitchell walking slowly backwards away from you toward the water. She does not stop as she backs into the small neighborhood pond. And as she continues in steadily, the water rises above her head. and you're sitting at the bar in a tavern. Behind the bar is a mirror, and you see your reflection. You recognize your thick, hand-stitched clothing from the dead body you found on the way into town. The barmaid refills your glass. looking for a room? Ooh.
1481.20 1492.20 speaker4  Were you guys Silas Cole, too? You want to try it one more time? Kinda.
1490.20 1507.70 speaker3  If we all hold hands, I mean, it can't hurt. And I hand the watch over to you I grab... I complete the triangle.
1505.70 1509.70 speaker4  Somebody has to put this watch on for me.
1507.70 1512.70 speaker3  I put it on his wrist.
1511.70 1513.70 speaker2  Thank you.
1512.70 1528.70 speaker3  And then grab his hand. At the same time,
1526.70 1609.20 speaker2  and it's dark. You can barely make out the silhouette of a hooded figure lurking in the shadows of this confined space. But light floods in, illuminating a decrepit and haggard Clark Bishop, clutching a book made of some sort of uncured leather, blood dripping from its spine. The visibility is due to the opening of this empty tomb. In walks a tall, gaunt creature with translucent skin and stretched out limbs wearing a black suit. Please give me the book. After a beat, both figures sprint towards each other, only ten feet apart to start, and a blinding light cleanses the interior of this mausoleum before you see Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, and John Lee Pettymore the Thirth And the three of you step back away from each other.
1607.70 1613.20 speaker3  That was fine. What the hell does this even mean?
1611.20 1623.70 speaker2  I think everybody roll Sanity on that one. Oh, fuck.
1622.20 1627.20 speaker4  An eighty-seven. That's so for my power.
1625.70 1629.70 speaker3  I got a one.
1628.70 1634.20 speaker4  Hell yeah.
1631.70 1715.50 speaker2  Luke and Thomas, take off your headphones. Did that. I'm at fourteen now. the nose, eyes, and ears, and a little bit out of the mouth of John Lee Pettymore the Thirth and you see that it has somehow wrapped itself around like coming down his arm and it seems to be dripping from both of his hands and looking down you kind of see that it's on your hands too and it's on Keith's hands and you seem to have just been connected just now by this black oily viscous ooze and as you back away it drips off your hands and onto the ground and some of the stuff that's a part of John Lee Pettymore just drips from his face he doesn't seem to notice that it's on him or in him and as it collects on the ground you look down and it begins moving toward you and then you blink and you can't see it anymore.
1710.50 1789.00 speaker4  While they're away, can I ask you, can that be part of my reaction to the over the power thing? Yes. But the deal though is that I have to inflict harm on someone so I can't just run away from it, right? Nope. goo that is no longer there? You can lash out at the thing that's there. Okay. Absolutely. Don't want to be. It wasn't even story related. Wow. It was all right. He liked it for sure. Yeah. What brand was it? Genre.
1786.50 1791.00 speaker3  I don't know what the...
1790.00 1807.48 speaker4  It used a lot of inanimate objects. and then stomping on the ground really hard.
1806.48 1809.48 speaker2  It's here. It's here.
1808.48 1814.06 speaker4  It's here. And he's kind of running away and he's pointing at the ground and stomping at the ground and... What is it?
1813.06 1816.06 speaker3  What's here?
1815.06 1825.06 speaker4  It's the goo. It's the goo. It's the goo. It's the goo. And he's like stomping around. It was on you guys.
1824.06 1828.24 speaker3  Wipe yourselves off.
1826.06 1844.78 speaker4  I see that and I think that's a good idea, so I start doing that.
1843.78 1852.78 speaker3  out. It's not here. We can't see it. You can't see it anymore. It's fine. We're fine. You guys.
1851.78 1863.84 speaker4  You were covered in it. It was on the ground. It started moving toward me. It started moving toward me.
1856.32 1876.92 speaker3  Clark, in life, you're going to be covered in all kinds of goos, just at different times. So I mean, just take a deep breath, wipe yourself off, you know, crack a cold one. That's what we do in convention.
1875.92 1880.24 speaker4  We can pour it on ourselves.
1878.92 1909.78 speaker3  I slip the watch back into my pocket. Thank God. We were not okay when you saw. Okay.
1907.94 1921.40 speaker2  How much sanity do you guys all have, Carious? Fourteen. Fourteen, twenty-five, and fourteen?
1917.08 1942.76 speaker3  In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
1937.36 1957.62 speaker2  because you're more almost, I mean, you're on your way to being, like, primordial back
1952.66 1983.68 speaker3  I think we, let's get back to the, do you think we should walk there, get back to the car, or, what do you think? Where is the pond? Oh, right by Maggie Cook's house? We're pretty far away from it. Well, we parked the car where we parked it because we were gonna come across a big checkpoint, right? Right. No.
1980.60 1986.24 speaker4  I mean, there's roads that lead south, but, okay.
1983.68 1996.04 speaker3  Can we loop around somehow, like backroads and stuff?
1990.76 2061.36 speaker2  you hear a voice that is coming from just south of you guys. There's a small neighborhood. our Facebook, pretending to be people, to see that short video of Luke just really getting in there. Behind the scenes during the recording session.
2058.18 2063.36 speaker3  You can tell how much I'm just focused in.
2062.36 2078.88 speaker4  Locked in. Okay.
2072.26 2113.00 speaker2  hear a truck that is close, literally a block away from you guys, it is the loudest thing in your ears currently, is this truck in the distance, and then you hear it, like, pull to a stop, and when it's idling, it's so much louder. This person is not taking care of their truck. How much worse can it possibly get? You don't want to give daddy a shot? He can go back and fix everything back to normal. We need more bodies, Randy.
2110.16 2128.00 speaker3  It sounds like they got Randy Anx told up in there. They're about to be in a world of shit.
2126.24 2133.00 speaker2  How long have we been playing Delta Green? Three years?
2131.00 2137.80 speaker3  There is indeed charisma.
2136.80 2139.80 speaker4  Yeah.
2138.80 2158.80 speaker2  Yeah. Who's got the best charisma? I've got six feet. That's how I talk about it.
2157.80 2185.80 speaker3  He's no Ron Stampler. Uh, shit. I got a 99. Oh no. It says 99.
2179.80 2200.80 speaker2  Luke, uh, Keith Wigner knows exactly who that voice is and it's Terrence Liquor. And you know that Terrence Liquor- From Liquors Liquors?
2199.80 2216.80 speaker4  Liquors Liquors Liquors.
2213.80 2224.80 speaker3  up and they're selling for 50 cents more.
2222.80 2232.80 speaker2  His stand up is Liquors Bickers.
2230.80 2247.80 speaker3  Okay, what's Terry Liquor doing? Terrence. Terrence Elizabeth.
2244.80 2314.80 speaker2  Always has a lip packed with chew and the scent of booze on his breath. Oil stained hands and a ripped flannel shirt. Thinks he's smarter than he really is. Prone to flattery, short temper, questionable morals if it'll benefit him. These are the things that Keith Wigner knows because Terrence Liquor and Keith Wigner do not get along. Shout out to B. Crever on our Patreon. This is the first use of an NPC from our patrons at the $10 level. So thank you B. Crever. Super cool. I believe it was Liquors.
2310.80 2350.80 speaker4  Yeah, he, I gave him a five. He gave me, he gave me two and he...
2348.80 2424.80 speaker3  I got beef. Well, it sounds like we just need to apprehend him and we have grounds to do it. John Lee Kevin Moore, just like laughs. I know you're, uh, I know you're sore at this feller, but, uh, should we maybe scout the situation out first, wreck an order, see if we can't go in from behind and help Randy out? If you want to, and I pull my gun out and start walking towards the disturbance. Yes. My face is like red and I'm stomping towards the noise.
2419.80 2555.80 speaker2  Well, if you're reaching in Keith's pocket, you'll have to go, uh, you'll have to go dexterity.
2549.80 2580.80 speaker4  Yeah. I mean, I would like to contest that at that point. I'm looking at him as it happens.
2573.80 2612.80 speaker3  John, John misses again and very like exasperated. Like he just lets out a huge sigh and then slaps it on himself.
2605.80 2749.80 speaker2  It's like a whole episode of watchness. So here's what I will tell you. That's not fun. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what happens and then I'm going to go in and rerecord a cool version of it later. Puddles have collected from rain and in them you can see the reflection of the moonlight pouring in through the crack and hole filled roof. Three figures are standing near the wall and the shadows and their silhouette looks like a race podium or dug trio. Closer you see this lemmy suit clad translucent skinned creature hands a small manila envelope to the two actual humans standing before it. A man and a woman. They open the envelope and inside there's only a small piece of paper with a hand drawn symbol. It is a filled in circle encircled by six circles. Another bright flash of light engulfs your vision and you see James the mill worker. Just James dragging two bodies. This man and woman you just saw across the floor of his house. And then we see these two individuals from above. They're sitting lifeless at the bottom of a small man-made pit. And you see a sort of time lapse of the bodies bloat and change color. As it fades you see Chief Maggie Cook giving orders to a looming overweight man wearing an all black combat uniform.
2748.80 2762.80 speaker3  Yes.
2758.80 2774.80 speaker2  But not too many and that's on you.
2770.80 2810.80 speaker4  Zach your shirt is very Star Trek The Next Generation. The buttons that were laying on your chest made it look like pips from Star Trek. That's what helped the illusion. Oh. Whoops.
2808.80 2826.80 speaker2  Keith House. And Clark Bishop just ripped his hand away from John Lee Pettymore the Third who slapped on the bracelet onto himself.
2823.80 2965.80 speaker3  Guys. Yeah. I mean. Keith! Keith! I turn around and look at him and I'm like slowly walking backwards but I'm listening. Yeah. Well so you wanna know why? Cause that's what I just saw. So. Myriad had sent two people out to like intercept James the Mill worker or something. That part wasn't super clear but James dispatched them or came into possession of their bodies somehow. But you know the two dead fellas we found at the bottom of that pit in James's house. And yeah it just seems like we get a lot of information every time we put this thing on so. I'm pretty much team watch right now. Formerly team PETA. I mean that's good to know but does it help us right now? But it just seems like we could really blow this whole mystery open by just repeatedly putting this watch on. I don't know if you know God ever thought of that when he created such.
2960.80 2983.80 speaker4  You mentioned that Maggie was she sent the robot to kill us?
2977.80 2995.80 speaker3  And that robot had the myriad logo on it right? That's where we first found out about myriad.
2990.80 3005.80 speaker4  Me neither. I just remembered that it stunk down there because they were decomposing.
2999.80 3027.80 speaker3  You know two days ago when you fell into that pit of bodies did you notice anything strange or were you just horrified? Overwhelmed by the stench of death.
3025.80 3029.80 speaker4  Two cocks.
3027.80 3071.80 speaker3  That's right I remember.
3055.80 3107.80 speaker2  The statue's bow tie flips the coffee table over so when you like touch the statue's bow tie it flipped the coffee table over showing an enormous stash of weapons body armor and a long black plastic tube the size of a baseball bat. And then written in blood where one of the guns should be it said stop her and inside that big tube was a map of calm comfy campground. Yeah.

3175.80 3203.80 speaker3  Mystery device sorry case device. However you personally wanted to find the situation we've all found ourselves caught up in. John Lee Pettymore kind of has an ongoing narrative of his whole life just running his head at all times.
3198.80 3264.80 speaker4  Clark would be very intrigued by that prospect but I think he's kind of scared of it too. John I'm actually I'm kind of on board with this idea of exploring the uses of the watch but it I'm telling you I saw last time we put it on. Sure. The ooze it came out of you guys. It came out of you guys. I don't think it's all good. I don't think it's all good. It may even it may even just be showing us something that who knows what it means. None of it's we don't we don't know. And Keith's walking away. I feel like maybe we should take care of what's going on now. Get to a safe spot and then maybe I don't know experiment with it or something. I don't I don't know. I just I think there's a chance it's unsafe.

But you hear this truck just idling in the front and you're not sure if tea liquor has made his way into the house yet or if he's still out front. Which approach do you guys want to take? And you look up and you're staring straight at this truck. In the back of the truck you see that there's a tarp slumped over the sides and there's water kind of splashing off. And you see fish kind of like jumping up through it and in the back sitting in the water in this puddle that has been teemed you see an older man who has like super long hair and hippy dippy and you recognize him as manager of Subtropolis Jimmy Sanders. So you're looking at this dude and his eyes are wide and wild and he's just like sniffing around he's like number four with the no tomato no tomato no tomato extra cream cheese and he's just like looking around all over the place and you think he might have seen you but he didn't like he couldn't tell.
3657.80 3727.80 speaker3  Yeah I just open the door I get the keys turn the truck off and stick them in one of my pockets and I zip the pocket up.
3704.80 3826.80 speaker2  This dude is burly as fuck he is five foot four so he looks super wide it's in his mid-30s and he's got short cropped black hair blue eyes and impeccably white teeth and he's wearing a gray sweatsuit a black beanie and chucks so exactly the rocky uniform like when he's running up the where is that?
