Last time, the group relived a short chunk of time thanks to the chantin' of Don D. Pettymore. The second attempt was much better for Keith Beans and much, much worse for Jack Russell, who was skewered by the rabbit ball. After John Lee Kevinmore the 3rd realized his goo magic is perhaps endlessly powerful, He created a portal to the other stilted bunker, where Keith had just walked through the hatch door. Clark and John narrowly escaped the wild ball, leaving Leo Piston to yet another hellish experience. Don D followed the boys into this new plane of existence, and John closed the gate behind them. The inside walls of this tube exude the same bright light they all stand on, and lumbering across the luminous land of this cylinder is an indescribable beast. Taking us now to the scene of a literally breathtaking roar is Dragon N3 with What Kind of World Are You Livin' In?

370.72 384.72 speaker2  a prayer. I'm good. That means you're in, right? Hold on.
383.52 459.08 speaker1  had ideas. What if the Carcano rifle Oswald used was a gun in a Delta Green setting, and every
454.08 479.52 speaker2  No, no, more of a Paul guy than a Peter guy, personally. Golf and religion. Golf and religion.
473.48 518.80 speaker1  You guys should really expand your world view into more like traditional white American golf balls you could fit in there. They do flush golf balls down toilets to show like how, how much water pressure there is or whatever. And toilets are kind of like butts because you poop into them. Wait, I'm sorry, what? They put a bunch of golf balls in a toilet and flush it and it's like, look how much
516.32 526.56 speaker2  Because you got to see how powerful that flush is. You got to know. I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
525.56 531.88 speaker1  Like what? He's like, yeah, I'm a plumber, but really it was just like doing everything you could to break your toilet. Right.
530.88 581.10 speaker2  And he put a little... Yeah. All right. Uh, let's... It sounds to me like Justin's not a part of the turbo team. is that John created a fucking portal, uh, with his goo magic. What are you calling that, Thomas? Does that, does that sound right?
580.10 583.70 speaker1  but we've never called it the muck.
581.10 589.26 speaker2  I like alliteration clearly this arc.
585.56 591.26 speaker1  That's also like down homie and would be appropriate for these characters. Muck magic.
590.26 595.94 speaker2  I like that a whole lot. Muck magic.
594.06 601.14 speaker1  I always knew that.
597.06 609.38 speaker2  You just said without thinking about it, talking about the current campaign, we're fighting the muck.
607.38 613.38 speaker1  No, no, no real conflicts. Okay. All right. Good.
612.38 622.18 speaker2  Good. Very straightforward stuff.
619.10 626.06 speaker1  and it doesn't really matter what form you put it in. It's pretty sure it's John.
624.62 633.50 speaker2  What's your goal though?
630.98 650.36 speaker1  I'm our, I'm fighting for it. I'm with us. The muck needs to go back. I'm not going to go, you know, I'm one of the good ones.
647.90 818.28 speaker2  led you through this hatch. John closed the portal behind you and the hatch door that you walked through disappeared along with it. And as you guys look around, you see the ground you all stand on. It's made of light. There's a soft glow that illuminates this new world from below and every direction surrounding you, what could be called the ground meets what could be called the sky. And it's this blacker than black opaque darkness. And there's nothing on the horizon except for a single imposing building way off in the distance, dimly lit from below. But you can see that it's a slightly shiny pitch black, which I think would trigger your memories back to a specific picture that you found inside Julie Maxwell's crashed vehicle. But Keith doesn't notice any of that because he is staring straight up and each of you understand why he hasn't stopped staring when you follow his gaze up into a tube of pure light hanging above. The interior wall of this incandescent pipe is made of the same light you currently stand on and there seems to be only complete darkness beyond its well lit passage. So imagine, yeah, someone who is just extremely massive out of this world bigger than you is holding a them sized toilet paper roll above the world that you are in. The interior of the toilet paper roll is made of this pure light, but the outside of it is made out of pure darkness. And so you can see up through it past all the light is darkness as well. And inside this immense, resplendent toilet paper holder, consistently plotting the glowing terrain somehow simultaneously moving toward you and staying at a uniform range, there's this towering, lumbering beast seemingly made of the darkness that surrounds everything in this place. It walks on two massive legs the size of trees, its broad shoulders swing back and forth high above the glossy ground. As you all stare, its image seems to form and reform over and over like incomprehensible little glitches and you cannot fully make sense of its shape.
815.12 834.32 speaker1  Can you do it one more time or tell it to me in a different way?
825.04 943.38 speaker2  Yeah, so imagine that gravity is pulling everything inside this tube to the walls of the tube, the internal walls. So this thing's walking on a different level of gravity from you guys. It's walking down, but it is clearly like on the wall of the tube. Now above you is the toilet, I'm holding up a toilet paper roll above the notebook. in the sky made of light. But then as it moves around, this thing is not stagnant, it's kind of moving. It is always directly above you and also very much not all at the same time. So it is a round circle that then you can see as you're looking straight up, you are seeing the inside of this tube as well as through the tube into the darkness that is above it. Now inside the tube, if you guys are looking straight up, there is this creature inside the tube and it's massive. And I imagine the tube to be gargantuan in nature, we're talking hundreds of yards across. So this creature, while not taking up a ton of room inside of this tube, also you can see how huge this thing is. The creature is walking along it, but it could also be walking along this side or across the top or across the other side or across the bottom, always seemingly lumbering toward you and keeping the exact same distance away from you all at the exact same time.
942.30 950.14 speaker1  Is it bipedal?
949.14 969.82 speaker2  Cool. Which means that this thing is fucking huge. Good screenshots, Luke. Does that make more sense?
968.82 979.02 speaker1  I failed.
976.46 1007.70 speaker3  and I was like, how do I have fucking 40 sanity? I'm kicking ass right now.
1004.62 1046.28 speaker1  signs of losing a little bit of their minds. And he then becomes agitated because it's like, what? breaking? Get over the world you knew and embrace, embrace the muck.
1043.14 1057.04 speaker2  Clark Bishop sees something a little bit different. Not only does Clark see what this is, but he also sees the history that he has with this creature.
1056.04 1058.40 speaker3  It's a two.
1057.04 1066.76 speaker2  Lose two sanity.
1063.12 1091.24 speaker3  It looked like a old, like old school rotary phone. So that's not, that's not the phone we're looking for, is it?
1090.24 1098.70 speaker1  Where are they? Where are they? Where is who, Clark? The circle.
1097.70 1132.72 speaker3  They were chanting. They were chanting to keep this creature at bay. I don't, I don't see them. I don't hear them. Where are they? This can't be good. This can't be right. This can't be right. This can't be right. This can't be right. This can't be right. This can't be right. That's the thing. That's the thing I've been telling you guys about. And the circle was keeping it here. And if they're not here, I don't, I don't know what's, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going on here. Do you remember what they were chanting? Hey handler, can I, Joe doesn't for sure. Could Clark do a role to see if he remembers?
1123.98 1169.38 speaker2  Do an intelligence at a, okay, I'm going to do negative 20 for how many lives you've lived since then. negative 20 for the sheer horror of being sent to another realm by a little bug that
1168.38 1173.30 speaker1  40, he would have failed.
1171.62 1201.18 speaker3  I didn't really care about chance back then. I wasn't paying attention. some of those circle of knowledge guys while we were here and they'd help us get back. So that kind of blows my pant plan out to shit. I don't, I don't know what's going on now.
1195.70 1207.86 speaker1  Leo and sit him here to die for eternity while he chants it, or we could at least say something temporarily. It seems like that's kind of a dead end though.
1204.10 1223.68 speaker3  Yeah, it'd be a good idea if I could just remember that damn chant.
1221.54 1230.30 speaker2  Yeah, ever so slightly. And then all of a sudden I need Thomas and Joe and Justin to take their headphones off.
1227.66 1253.38 speaker1  Uh oh, I hope I'm alive when they get back.
1246.38 1318.62 speaker2  Some darkness has pulled itself and you see it's holding on to the bone right above the ankle and it is rubbed down through this man's pants to where the pants are cut and it is rubbed through the skin. There's blood pouring down the man's legs up toward his torso and then onto his face, a face that you recognize that is beet red. And there are two belts pulled tightly around his neck. And Keith beans, you are looking directly into the face of Keith beans, your own face, maybe a year or two older. And he is wearing clothes that you recognize as clothes that you wore when you were going under the name Silas Cole. Damn.
1316.86 1327.34 speaker1  into the body. It takes me a second to realize and I look down and he's dead obviously, right? He's not.
1325.90 1358.38 speaker2  His face is completely red. Keith. Yeah, that's me. It's me.
1357.38 1375.54 speaker1  It's you. It's me.
1374.54 1382.34 speaker2  Mary.
1378.10 1384.34 speaker1  Oh, I guess that'd be like a bunch of years, right?
1383.34 1412.94 speaker2  Yeah, a bunch. Uh, you, he like tries to reach out to grab you and you see like his hands have been hanging down to the ground below his head for who knows how long. They're completely red. Uh, he seems to have no use of the fingers. So he's just kind of like prodding at you, uh, with these unmoving phalanges.
1411.34 1438.10 speaker1  Get the blood out of your head. I want to like touch the goo, whatever is holding him up is, am I able to manipulate it at all? Yeah, it's malleable enough. You can manipulate it.
1431.22 1442.74 speaker2  the sky around you as if, uh, it is, it stretches out and then kind of snaps. I'm thinking like laughing, like Laffy Taffy.
1440.58 1443.74 speaker1  If you like stretched out Laffy Taffy.
1442.74 1451.62 speaker2  Yes.
1448.66 1509.58 speaker1  Can you stand up? put the blood back down. In all that time you were just with Luke, did he make it to, um, did we see him like go in the tower?
1505.22 1530.50 speaker2  He made it about a third of the way before you see that there's something else in the distance that he is, he's dealing with, uh, another body there. Uh, it was hanging upside down at first and then he like pulls it down to the ground.
1528.78 1539.82 speaker3  Do we, is it a person?
1538.62 1555.02 speaker1  Is Don with us?
1554.02 1587.34 speaker0  phone in here. I don't, we need to find the phone. the phone. around here. Yeah, we gotta, we gotta find, we gotta find that phone. John, your friends are weird.
1586.34 1596.94 speaker3  That's wonderful.
1591.54 1602.22 speaker1  My muck magic, my, my spider senses, as it were, they're kind of sending me towards a Keith's direction. I think we should maybe go check that out and see, see if he's sure these friends of
1601.22 1616.16 speaker3  yours are reliable. We got an important mission right now. We got to find that phone. Oh Lord.
1611.60 1619.74 speaker1  So like it's, we sticking with them is probably the best direction towards that. If you think so.
1618.74 1628.62 speaker3  We got to find that phone.
1620.94 1793.10 speaker1  So like I said, my, my, my muck Dar, my, my, my tingly connection to this world, you know, it seems to be pointing me towards Keith. Let's just head that way. And I grabbed him by the shoulder and I kind of, I kind of push him towards that direction and start walking with him and guiding him. So you see a man sitting on the ground in front of Keith and Keith is putting his hands around the man's head like this. We can see that, but you're going to have to describe it for the listeners. Yeah. Like massaging his head with his hands around his head and like pushing down and then like going down his shoulders or like up his hands and down his body and like rubbing him down. And then as you get closer, you see that the man in front of him on the ground has just looks like all the blood is in his head. And after you kind of get over that, like the kind of purpley red on his full forehead And after you see all that, you realize that the man is Keith beans. But he's got some old timey clothing on. Now there's two of them. Guys. I found me. It's Silas Cole. What happened to make you sound like that? He had these belts around his neck and he was hanging upside down and I'm just trying to get the blood back down into the rest of his body. I forget Keith that you did pass that EMT class so you do know exactly what to do in these situations. rest of your body.
1787.66 1816.90 speaker3  Keith, why does, why does Silas Cole look, it's you, but you said it's Silas. I don't, I don't understand.
1812.42 1859.10 speaker1  as I see him, uh, he said he got thrown into a hole and that's how he got here. And I remember when I was him, I got thrown in to a hole by Mary. Like yeah. Okay.
1856.06 1875.10 speaker2  It's just, when you do lean forward, then we get really, really good audio. But then when you don't, it isn't good. And I love you. I love you too.
1874.10 1877.10 speaker1  Good. Good.
1876.10 1889.50 speaker2  That seems, that seems perfect. That seems right.
1888.02 1900.20 speaker1  I failed. Regular fail.
1896.58 1906.90 speaker2  you think maybe that you're both at the same time right now. Isn't that you? I mean, it is you. Yeah.
1905.90 1958.62 speaker1  Did that hurt? No. I start rubbing his throat like you would a dog that you're trying to get to swallow time and all of a sudden his little bits are gone in this time?
1956.22 1976.26 speaker3  You're a past version of, of Arky. Do you know us? Do you, are you, do you know who I am? Yeah. You're the overseer. That's that's, that's kind of. No, you're Clark Bishop. You're my partner.
1975.26 2017.18 speaker2  He's ball. You know, that's, I don't know you. then I saw Tildy and I used the gun and I was Silas Cole.
2016.18 2037.78 speaker1  I remember now. So then, so then after you were thrown as Silas Cole into a hole, a, a Cole in a hole, then you woke up again in the mausoleum with us? No. No, not you. Our Keith. Sorry. Sorry. Not you. Oh, you want to hear mine though? Don't we, didn't we just figure yours out?
2035.50 2043.38 speaker2  Just the past, not the, not the present.
2042.38 2057.38 speaker1  been going on? I just been hanging. Okay. Yeah. Once you got here or before you got here? Once I got here.
2055.18 2066.50 speaker3  So there's, there's other people around and Clark starts looking around.
2065.34 2071.74 speaker2  to get rid of them? Like the professor and the rancher.
2070.74 2076.74 speaker1  That's right. Cause we got the big judge, the big judge was Mary.
2075.74 2079.34 speaker2  That's right. Mary got a hold of Judge Cortland.
2078.34 2105.54 speaker1  Good God, Keith. How many did you kill in the service of contentions founding? I mean, I, I really, when I was him, I had, I would say literally no control over my actions. I'm just saying you're, you're saying like a Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. Yeah. But Silas says things like a Nazi. I'm Silas Cole.
2104.54 2106.54 speaker3  And I'm Keith.
2105.54 2200.66 speaker1  He's me. And no, but he's him. I'm not him right now. He is me though. get you confused. And puts it on your Keith. A fancy little, yeah, on our Keith. Now we'll just remember Keith has, has the, the fetching. You better not draw a Hitler mustache on me. No, I didn't draw you Hitler mustache. I really like this fella named Jimmy Buffett and he's got a song called Pencil Thin Mustache about all the movie stars that you grew up watching. It's, it's a couple tracks after that I think on the greatest hits maybe. But yeah, you got a little, a nice little Clark Gable mustache. Well thank you. Look, there's a happy little twist. into... He high fives you. I high five him back. How's his hands looking?
2195.82 2218.98 speaker2  because it would hurt so much if you high five someone with all the blood still like in your hands.
2209.94 2225.74 speaker1  guy, and he, you know, basically killed, kind of got rid of us. A giant guy? Big old guy. Is that guy up there in the toilet paper tube?
2223.54 2231.82 speaker3  No, not that big.
2227.94 2241.86 speaker1  You know, Clark was babbling a little bit about it, but it seemed like he, he had taken leave of his mind there. He seemed to think that there should, should be others, other people, other...
2237.18 2259.50 speaker3  Yeah, uh, Fool Keith, uh, you've been here for a while, have you seen other people around here? Have you seen, when I was here a long time ago, there were people who were kind of keeping that thing at bay, and I don't see them here now. Have you seen them go anywhere, do anything, or? What happened to them, do you know?
2255.90 2265.14 speaker2  Nope, they're just not there no more, but that thing's bigger now.
2264.14 2278.90 speaker1  of there? Who kicked you out? A long time ago. Who kicked you out?
2268.14 2290.98 speaker2  Gambler, named Thomas, uh, the professor, and the rancher, and, uh, bartender, the piano player, they were all super angry that I'd thrown them down here.
2289.98 2302.98 speaker1  I've been calling it a muck.
2301.98 2310.98 speaker2  Nah.
2304.98 2330.78 speaker1  So you're, you are the, the Keith who became Silas, and, and made ball? Ahhh!
2325.98 2341.78 speaker2  and he puts it on his thumb, and then he swipes it across your forehead, and he says,
2340.78 2375.54 speaker1  Keith is. Thank you, thank you for accepting me, Daddy. Oh, you're beautiful. Thank you, I try, I hope I'll make you proud. Have you, have you had children? No, I'm a bit of, you know, I'm a bit of a, bit of a hound dog, bit of a bachelor, race car, former race car driver, you know. Yeah, I pound it. Can I ask you just one question, Daddy?
2373.54 2380.54 speaker2  So then I did it again, because I already had.
2375.54 2410.42 speaker1  Ain't that just why parents keep having babies, you know, when you get right down to it? Just doing what's expected of you, or what you think's expected of you. Alright, so it's not like I was planned, but you had to do it, I get it, alright. I have as much of a valid reason for existing as any of these guys did. And you're just trying to do them?
2406.42 2414.42 speaker2  I just did what I did, and it happened to be the thing that already happened, because that's what I did.
2412.42 2418.42 speaker1  You're so wise, Daddy.
2416.42 2428.30 speaker2  Wow, that is...
2426.30 2461.18 speaker1  Right on, right on. Thanks, Pops. I hate to break this up as sweet as it is, but I, you know, before I ran right into you, I was trying to get to that building because of that, as I point up.
2451.18 2647.06 speaker2  And you remember that this Silas Cole version of Keith did say that since the people around it have gone, that the thing has been getting bigger. And then you look back down at the building in the distance, and you all see, making its way toward you, across this twinkling terrain, is some sort of four-wheeled personal vehicle. Like a double-wide motorcycle. But as soon as it starts to get close enough for you all to recognize the wheelsman of this sort of smart car without the little doors or roof, a portal opens up right above it. A very similar portal to the John Made Hole you all just recently escaped through, and crashing down onto the back of this tricycle with the same amount of wheels in the front as in the back, is a gaunt woman with crazy hair and enormous thick glasses that make her already large eyes look even bigger. She wears jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket, and four wiry metal tendrils protrude from the back of her neck. One dethrones the previous driver of this four-wheeler, tossing him behind like carelessly placed banana peels in Mario Kart. As the other three plant themselves firmly into the fluorescent floor below. so high in fact that she seems to click into a new set of gravitational rules, and she falls wheels first onto the ground of the bright cylinder that hangs above this place, and houses the lumbering Gigantam Bropithecus, and the consistently one-upping itself ATV drives up and away from you. and suddenly a portal opens up above the four-wheeler. Rose Mary, M-A-R-Y, comes down and lands on the back of the four-wheeler. One of the four metal tendrils coming out of her neck rips the driver off of the four-wheeler and tosses them behind her, and then the other three tendrils plant themselves into the ground and fling her and the ATV up into the air so fucking high that they go up inside the toilet paper holder, cylinder of light that is hanging above you all, and she lands inside of it and starts driving towards this massive lumbering beast that you've seen.
2646.06 2665.06 speaker1  Fail.
2657.06 2722.06 speaker2  because two of you watched Marvin Glass fling the ball at her when it took her over before she fired the gun, and you already knew that these things were capable of, like, insane feats. and then for Jon, personally, realizing that you can be in your body and use the metal tendrils is a new idea, which that could be sanity-blasting in and of itself that you could be a Spider-Man villain if you so choose.
2721.06 2748.06 speaker3  Holy shit. I got a 55.
2746.06 2778.06 speaker0  I don't know why I did that voice.
2773.06 2795.06 speaker1  If you have a lame role-playing group with bad rolls, it's because God doesn't love you. You just gotta pray harder.
2792.06 2866.06 speaker2  And you guys are standing there. Dawn, you don't see fucking anything, but the other three see a bright flash of light right in front of you. And Thomas, take off your headphones real quick. Justin, same with you. Clark and Keith see the translucent, spindly hand holding an old, strange-looking camera with a green light lit as it takes a picture of the three of you standing on this luminous land with darkness in the sky behind you. This thing blipped in for only a moment. Dope. Holy shit.
2864.06 2885.06 speaker3  Holy shit. I think I saw it. I saw it was him. Did you see it? I saw him, too. Yeah, what are y'all talking about?
2883.06 2907.06 speaker1  You remember seeing that picture, don't you, Clark? Taking our picture. Taking whose picture?
2905.06 2936.06 speaker3  A couple days ago. And he kept asking us why we were in it. And at the time, we sure as shit didn't know. But now we know. I guess it was now. Back then, he took our picture now, right?
2934.06 2953.06 speaker1  At least I know where we were?
2947.06 2985.06 speaker3  Because he showed us that picture, and then Rosemary did her shit in the office, and she fired the gun. And now we see, presumably, that she ended up here. But he'd already taken the picture when we saw all that. But just now, we saw that Rosemary came down through a portal, went tearing off into the glowing light up there on the ATV, and then the picture got taken. So there's something weird still going on with all this. Oh, there's something weird going on here?
2978.06 2988.06 speaker2  Literally, the second Keith moves into frame and pokes at the little metal tendrils coming out the back of your neck.
2986.06 3077.06 speaker1  I give him an uncle slap. The pet and uncle slap away. Ouchie, ouchie. Yeah, like if I had a watch or something? I want to look up and see what's happening up above us right now.
3076.06 3083.06 speaker2  Nope.
3081.06 3116.06 speaker1  No, that was me. Sorry. Was I saying that? Something weird's happening here. Why did the Circle want to keep this thing up there, and what do y'all think Mary might want with it?
3108.06 3131.06 speaker3  They seemed to think that it was kind of the Destroyer sort of be-all-end-all. If it got out of here, things would be bad. He's like the savior that is going to stop that thing once and for all.
3130.06 3174.06 speaker1  Should we boost you up there? And we're here. The whole time. Mrs. Doubtfire, you guys like that scene? It's a fun movie. The whole time? Anyway. Or like Harry Potter. Always.
3173.06 3181.06 speaker2  Or like Sandlot.
3180.06 3186.06 speaker1  Yeah. He's scary, but ultimately he's a sweetheart.
3182.06 3215.06 speaker3  So Clark, if you were going to fight that thing right now, how would you do it? I was just repeating what I heard though. I don't know if... I can't like create. I don't think.
3210.06 3235.06 speaker1  Just say some bullshit and we'll see if that like giant stumbles or something. I don't know. Don. Maybe it coming out of your mouth gives it power.
3230.06 3245.06 speaker3  cracks his neck, looks up at the monster up there and with...
3241.06 3285.06 speaker2  as the portal opened up above and a man got thrown off the four-wheeler. He's been walking toward you slowly this entire time. And so you can keep talking for sure and give it a go. But just to let you know what you see, which is a slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt. He's got tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down to his hands and fingertips. Friend is branded across his forehead.
3280.06 3298.06 speaker1  He knows that if we say too-doo-hock-a-noo right now, the game's over. We win.
3293.06 3313.06 speaker2  And the staff is made out of, you guessed it, pure darkness.
3310.06 3334.06 speaker3  Was it Jermaine? I was looking up which one it was. It absolutely is Jermaine. Fuck yeah.
3330.06 3343.06 speaker2  You certainly roll unnatural for your too-doo-hock-a-noo.
3338.06 3374.06 speaker3  This is either narratively great or narratively awful, but it's an 83 on a 63, so I fail. And it motherfucking is, y'all!
3367.06 3452.06 speaker2  and it begins, boom, boom, boom, moving faster and faster and closer and closer toward you. And as it reaches, the ATV is going straight towards it, and the two are about to collide. Clark is yelling back to the guest, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea! creating a sort of saddle on this thing as she rides on the back of his neck as this gigantic umbropithecus with Rose M-A-R-Y on the back of it leaps from the edge of the cylinder and lands on the same plane as the five of you. Oh, fuck.
3448.06 3452.06 speaker0  Crossing the double line, doing it every time. What kind of world are you living in?
