0.00 48.64 speaker0  Greetings my disciples, it is your leader in prayer and song, Wolf the Dog, and I am here to preach the good word about all the happenings in this silly thing we call life. I'm also here to tell y'all about how to attain true salvation and get y'all into dumps to meet heaven. The one true secret to life and happiness is... Oh wait, before that we got a show to run here y'all, apologies. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Doug Blake, who recommended pretending to be people on Facebook. I mean, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is an Ari Manstein event review by ZomBenny2099.
44.68 63.96 speaker1  mausoleum littered venue that is the city cemetery.
61.40 124.98 speaker0  that this would be a boil to remember. But alas, the only thing I will remember is my disappointment. First and foremost the service was terrible, there weren't even any eating utensils provided. I actually witnessed a hip, well dressed young man, obviously from the city, resort to eatin' straight from the pot as no one came to serve him. Needless to say, I never actually got to taste any crawfish. Equally as disappointing, the music was nonsensical. I'm as down with new age music as the next city dweller, but this was just weird gibberish that seemed to last forever and yet was over as soon as it began. I was not alone in thinking this as several frustrated diners shot the DJ. It was around this time that I took my leave, disappointed and hungry. Still, all things considered, not the worst crawfish boil I've been to, two and a half stars out of five.
119.82 131.74 speaker1  You know, Wolf ain't never been to a crawfish boil that didn't have some kinda crazy shit
126.42 215.82 speaker0  But all that crazy shit always leads to a massive reward at the end of the night when they dump out all them shells into the trash, a treasure trove of candy red exoskeletons discarded by the masses, all so your old little old wolf can take a Scrooge McDuck dive into them, swimmin' around gettin' my fill with my mouth wide open. That is the kinda spicy bug I like to eat. So anyway, you need to remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to how, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write a five-star review and email us at PretendingPod at Gmail.com. Clark Bishop found a well-worn VHS tape of his parents playing Wheel of Fortune and winning outlining three different operations. The group recovered at a walk-in clinic before toolin' up and enterin' Marvin Glass's playground through a trap door like great in an alleyway.
213.94 227.24 speaker1  on Twitch this Friday.
223.08 284.62 speaker0  I hear one of those boys might sound a lot like me. Yeah, right, that'd be crazy, y'all. Aw, hell yeah, the thought of those boys streamin' has Wolf's face beamin'. But until then, I'll keep dreamin' and dreamin' of incessant screamin'. It's Kudzu with no backbone. Let it pop, pop, pop, pop, in your butthole pop.
282.84 287.44 speaker1  Put them up there and lick them real good. Let me get that popper.
285.62 289.60 speaker0  Make it a spicy butthole.
287.44 298.08 speaker1  Spicy butthole in my pants. Spicy butthole does my dance. I like dancing with my butt. You will like me when I strut.
297.08 306.64 speaker0  Oh!
300.08 335.30 speaker1  I literally woke up, sat on my couch, smoked weed all day, and watched Twitch. Nice. So I watched that from about 8 p.m. until 3 in the morning. That's Mr. Chang.
328.74 341.94 speaker2  Anyway, he's also, I think, the most watched Grand Theft Auto roleplayer on Twitch. He's a lot of fun. Anyway, I did that, and I also watched. It is a lot of fun.
339.78 347.06 speaker1  I watched a movie called About Time.
346.06 348.06 speaker2  Is that his name?
347.06 351.06 speaker1  That's Brendan Gleason's son. Yeah, Matt I. Moody's son.
350.06 369.74 speaker2  Which I didn't know for a long time. Oh yeah, because he's also in a couple, or maybe one Black Mirror episode. The fucking fairytale. Yeah. Oh yeah.
368.74 371.74 speaker1  Wait.
370.74 400.10 speaker2  Nye. Oh, I thought you said Bill Nye. I very much enjoyed it. Bill Nye. And before I watched About Time, I watched. Peach, Bill Nye. something dark. The Long Dark is what it was called. The Long Dark. Oh wow. Yeah.
399.10 401.10 speaker3  Fucking birthday baby.
400.10 415.78 speaker2  Yeah, you really hit it up. And I was thinking about going to Cherry Picker later in the night, and I was like, you know what? Fuck it. Well, heck yeah. And you can finally vote. I can finally vote now.
412.78 432.86 speaker1  Yeah, listeners, Luke is legal. Yeah.
427.90 446.38 speaker2  When I was younger, I leaned very much to the left, but you know, my parents, a lot of older people say like, once you get older, you'll be more conservative. And yesterday I woke up and I was like, damn, I kind of want to vote for Donald Trump today.
445.38 451.12 speaker1  Happy birthday. Yeah, thank you very much. No, that'll never happen.
448.98 463.74 speaker2  Listeners, I'm kidding.
457.46 479.26 speaker1  So, uh, Joe, when Joe got into the home today, he opened up the fridge to grab one of the beers that he brought. And then he just started giggling like a madman.
474.10 486.58 speaker3  I had somehow bought the seven ounce Corona bottles that for some reason look like long
484.78 488.58 speaker2  Why did they make those?
487.58 501.46 speaker3  I guess. I don't know. Well, wow.
500.46 502.46 speaker2  That's so cool.
501.46 503.46 speaker1  Like two years ago.
502.46 510.02 speaker3  Yeah.
507.66 520.42 speaker2  And it was like a, like a mudslide or a white Russian or something. And I drink and I was like, tastes good, but kind of bad.
519.42 527.98 speaker1  don't like big mouth.
523.90 531.18 speaker2  I mean, I don't hate it, but I mean, I've only, I've only seen like, all right, so let's
527.98 544.78 speaker1  get into this episode 39. That's a big number. We're almost to a, almost a 30, 30 more to go.
540.94 570.66 speaker2  instead you enjoyed it with us. Is that correct?
565.90 590.10 speaker1  And as you head into the den of sin, as you've been calling it, let's do it. You called it that. Yeah. I certainly did. you. And as you guys are falling, let's, let's do an equipment check. Let's see what you guys have on you.
587.54 605.88 speaker3  I just bought, or I bought three pistols altogether. I've got two in the waistband and one in my boot. And then a John Lee Pettymore bought us all a couple of flash grenades, a couple of regular grenades and a couple of smoke grenades.
601.48 612.28 speaker1  And you're also wearing an old school contention, police officers uniform.
608.88 616.28 speaker3  I guess I would still have the one that Maggie gave me to take out, you can have four on you if you want. It's a lot of pistols.
615.28 625.76 speaker1  All right.
624.76 631.32 speaker2  That's fine. I hate it. If I would've thought about it last episode, I would have said it.
630.32 633.28 speaker1  Okay.
631.32 648.24 speaker2  So what do you have on you Luke? I have my small but powerful pistol, two frag grenades, two flash grenades, two smoke grenades. And then on my back I have the giant fully auto machine gun.
646.00 657.80 speaker1  Two ARs welded together. Basically. Cold fusion gun.
656.80 663.32 speaker3  It's balling.
662.32 682.08 speaker1  And Thomas, what do you have on you? What does John Lee, Kevin Pettimore have on you? He's got his robot body. He's got body armor on top of that. All the grenades, same as the others. He's got a powerful pistol with a large magazine and a semi-automatic shotgun.
680.76 691.24 speaker3  Armed to the veritable teeth.
686.72 703.28 speaker2  I think maybe we should say what our health points are before we start, just so the listener knows. I think that's really smart.
697.32 717.96 speaker3  I had a maximum of 26 and my current sanity is at 18 with a breaking point at six.
716.96 764.26 speaker1  Good. Pretty good sanity. All right.
758.20 773.90 speaker2  much anybody at the gun shop, I had filled some of one of the cargo pants. I went over to the bait shop of the, of the gun store and filled one of my pockets up with a catfish food.
772.90 777.34 speaker1  Why catfish?
775.10 779.98 speaker2  It's like real mushy and super stinky.
778.98 785.56 speaker1  Yeah. Have you ever gone noodling?
781.86 798.46 speaker2  I think I might have told this story once, but I went with my dad or my uncle. We went gigging and noodling one day. Giggings fun. You get to eat some frog legs. Noodling sucks because a catfish bites your fucking arm and that's how you catch it.
796.06 803.42 speaker1  So yeah, that sounds like garbage. Yeah, I'll definitely allow that. You're supposed to use your dick.
801.74 814.18 speaker2  Oh, mine's not big enough.
811.82 949.78 speaker1  Eight times if you really tried. to float gently like you're just hanging weightless in vast nothingness. And then abruptly a bright light covers your entire field of vision and huge words appear in front of you in a spray painted font as a rumbling voice reads the massive tag that What you can only assume is the biggest Omnimax screen of all time fades to black and a video begins to play. It looks to be the inside of an enormous arena made of glass. In the background, hundreds of screaming spectators in the foreground, a hole begins to form in the floor and a shadowy form begins to emerge. But before this person can even hit the lights of the arena, a giant metal tentacle erupts into view, gripping the humanoid being and ripping it out of frame. The screen fades to black and you feel your feet touch the ground, your weight coming back down into your bodies. You all are standing in a cube of a room 20 feet across, made almost entirely of the oily obsidian you have previously seen in this building. It is disorienting. Across the room is a mouth of a concrete cave with the logo for the scrap pit spray painted above its entrance. To your left are two guards standing in front of a red, deep buttoned plush door. The guards are in full brown jumpsuits. They each have a large scythe strapped to their backs and the blade of each scythe is shaped like an enormous fish hook. A closer look reveals these men have unnatural matching faces. Their eyes are far apart, almost on either side of their face. Their noses do not jut out but are rather two slits above their two wide thick lipped mouths and they have a few flaps on either side of their necks. They turn and upon seeing you, press a button that lights up green and they move out of the way to either side of the gaudy door. What do you do?
948.70 982.28 speaker3  Noodle them, Keith. Can I see where we came from or is it, is it a closed space that we fell from?
979.60 1001.20 speaker1  It is just darkness above you. What do we see through the doors? Through the doors is a, another smaller room made completely out of the same oily black material. I just feel like we're going to walk into another Marvin Glass stadium.
997.34 1006.00 speaker2  I think we go through the gaudy doors and I mean they hit the green button. Gotta be better than a hypothetical red button.
1003.82 1019.76 speaker1  Can I see what you guys are picturing? How are you arranged right now? Are you two backing him already?
1013.34 1027.60 speaker2  He's got a gun wound that we literally gave him and I think we're just maybe have your hands behind your back, but not like cuffed or anything.
1022.78 1032.12 speaker1  And we're like, and we glued dog fur all over him, so he looks real Chewbacca.
1027.60 1051.66 speaker2  But I think we just, we look like he's our prisoner and we're walking him.
1046.94 1077.76 speaker1  These total fish men absolutely pay attention to your hobble. You guys march Clark Bishop into this room and the room's interior walls, floor and ceiling are the same beautiful like onyx obsidian reflector and the door closes behind you. There's nothing, just the shimmering black mirror on all six sides. And then you feel the room begin to move. Who has the lowest luck? I have 35.
1076.76 1078.76 speaker3  I've got 20.
1077.76 1084.60 speaker1  All righty. Thomas, go ahead and roll luck for me.
1081.68 1086.60 speaker2  I'm going to use these dice that Joe got me for the first time.
1085.60 1087.60 speaker3  Hope they serve you well.
1086.60 1093.60 speaker1  I'm going to open mine up too.
1092.60 1112.10 speaker3  Son of a bitch. That's my fault. I'm so sorry. I'm going to win.
1107.82 1185.90 speaker1  I'm not going to win. Wildy Joe. One of the walls opens, and you are looking into this dark room lit by two lanterns on either side of the room that have open flames coming from them. Right in front of you, there are six individuals passed out all in their underwear. Most are pretty rough-looking young children, and one is Oz, Mayhem, Wolf. They are all unconscious as a group of what I can only describe as grandmothers. They are older women. They are all dressed in long skirts and cardigans, and they have their hair up in tight little liquid into the mouths of these six passed out individuals. Real quick, I just need all of you to roll Sanity for me.
1184.90 1197.58 speaker2  Fail. 38.
1196.58 1223.36 speaker1  Yeah. Keith Vigna and Thomas John Lee Pettymore both lose one Sanity, and for this, Joe, I'm going to have you just take your headphones off and plug your ear holes. Okay. He just has these weird, like a Voldemort-like sucky-
1218.52 1246.74 speaker3  I'm nervous about all the laughter I'm seeing around the room.
1240.66 1270.68 speaker1  are hanging above these grandmothers, and one is a black dog and the other is a red lion, and they are weaving in and out of these grandmothers as they're walking and pouring this liquid into the mouths of the passed out individuals, and these spirits are diving and who the grandmas are giving what it is?
1269.68 1290.84 speaker2  Absolutely.
1288.50 1302.24 speaker1  but I don't know if that would work for this medium. Not for this medium. I don't know, listeners.
1300.24 1315.52 speaker2  What the fuck was that?
1309.02 1344.42 speaker1  with you, and the door shuts behind her, and she just turns to face the door and stands there. We do. What did he do?
1343.42 1350.64 speaker2  That's why we brought him here. He needs to be punished.
1349.64 1360.08 speaker1  I hope so.
1354.60 1377.46 speaker2  We need to tell somebody higher up, well, I was, I don't know who you are, but if you could get us to somebody, I was tasked with a major- He's new. I was tasked with something major for Marvin, and he got in my way and made that task impossible.
1374.10 1385.14 speaker3  He's going to be around working for us for a while, why don't you go ahead and introduce
1379.46 1398.06 speaker1  Kevin, thank you for making me aware of not introducing myself, I'm so sorry, that's such rude manners of mine. Keith Vigna, my name is Ursula, it's very nice to meet you, Ursula Oscythe, it's very
1394.22 1414.98 speaker2  It's nice to meet you as well, I can't look, or I am looking forward to working with you in the future.
1407.22 1418.92 speaker1  So basically what we do is we carry on a very old tradition of making sure that the sacrifices
1417.70 1433.10 speaker2  And how do you go about that?
1426.10 1448.90 speaker1  lots of specific directions and maths, but after some time we're able to put together a nice sort of change of blood for those that we bathe in our fun time juice.
1447.90 1455.42 speaker2  all around.
1449.90 1486.34 speaker1  And I know that you seem to be looking for someone to speak to, Keith Vigna, is that to. Nice to meet you.
1483.56 1496.90 speaker2  Good to see you, Kevin. And then I think in my head, we're probably supposed to get off here. Yeah, Keith. Yeah. Yeah, you get out. Let's do it.
1495.90 1503.74 speaker1  Let's do that. Get the fuck out of the elevator.
1501.14 1522.64 speaker2  She was totally hitting on me, right? Dude, did you see the way she looked at you? That was weird. Wow. Ursula, it's not maybe the name I would pick. All that torturing kept her fit. Okay. We walk off the elevator.
1518.12 1613.82 speaker1  You guys are still having this conversation and the camera zooms out and you are in a massive room. The door is already shut behind you and this room is dark and it is damp and you smell, you know that like that kind of YMCA kind of aquarium kind of smell going on? Nasty chlorine. Yes. Looking out, you see that there is a grid of catwalks that are absolutely infinite going away from you. are not covering, hanging from the foggy darkness above are rusty moss covered chains. Now some of the chains are just hanging like 10 feet out of the water and some of the chains go all the way in the water. In the distance, you see that a handful of these have people hanging from them. They're far away. They're just tiny people.
1612.82 1618.82 speaker3  Still above the water. Above the water.
1617.82 1621.46 speaker1  This is spooky.
1619.82 1635.64 speaker3  Dude, that's a really cool image. I just picture that so well in my brain and it's creepy and kind of beautiful in a weird way.
1634.64 1649.76 speaker1  Yeah. And let's go ahead and roll alertness for me or search depending. You can each roll on this one.
1647.76 1655.18 speaker3  Forty one on a 70 for alertness. Did we all pass?
1654.18 1657.18 speaker2  Mm-hmm.
1656.18 1659.18 speaker3  Group success.
1658.18 1709.94 speaker1  You guys get to see everything. Oh, you guys get to see everything. men wearing a brown jumpsuit. You also hear three voices in the unseen darkness across the enormous chamber. And because you guys rolled so well, you're going to recognize the voices that you hear. Keith, one of them is Francis Beans. My niece. Your niece. The other two are voices that you guys haven't heard in a while. It is Kathy and George Piston.
1708.94 1719.42 speaker2  Days even.
1715.70 1735.08 speaker1  run the Piston Pig Farm and the Piston Junkyard. Keith spent some time out there. I believe Kathy shot him in the foot. She did. Yeah.
1734.08 1744.80 speaker3  that showed up there. Where'd your pencil go? Real fast, Keith, what was your brother's name?
1743.42 1755.54 speaker1  What was your brother's name? Some knew him.
1754.54 1756.54 speaker2  It has something to do with beans.
1755.54 1770.02 speaker3  Oh, I know what it is. I know what it is. It's Fergie. Fergie. I was thinking it was Francis.
1769.02 1780.48 speaker2  So yeah, Fergie makes sense. Sorry.
1777.12 1790.06 speaker1  but you just recognize the tenor of their voices. So we don't have eyes on them? You can kind of see outlines that would help you realize who they were. They are like 200 yards away from you.
1787.48 1794.42 speaker2  There is some sort of light source in here. It's not pitch black at all. It is not.
1792.36 1802.00 speaker1  No, there is some unseen light source.
1797.72 1816.28 speaker3  As far as we can tell from here, are they just standing on a random catwalk or is there something near them that they're maybe congregated near?
1813.60 1817.28 speaker1  Kathy and George Piston are both hanging.
1816.28 1828.62 speaker3  Gotcha. Oh wow.
1822.62 1843.66 speaker2  I like whispered, do you guys want to, I mean, want to just approach them? Is it just in front of us that we can walk or can we take other paths? It's a big old grid, baby.
1841.82 1851.80 speaker3  We can just like push her over the rail.
1847.80 1865.64 speaker2  We try to get around her, but I don't want to get lost in this place. We might go talk to Francis, see if she can lead us. That's true. We could, if she starts to get violent, we can just three versus one. She's a little girl.
1861.88 1875.08 speaker3  We could also wait for her to leave and follow her. Follow and also maybe rescue Kathy and George and have another, have an army with us. I don't know. Yeah.
1874.08 1883.62 speaker2  That's also true. I don't know what it would be to go talk to her, but we can also wait until she leaves and try to follow her where she's going.
1882.30 1904.10 speaker3  I'll do whatever you guys want. You can't have that mindset.
1900.98 1912.44 speaker1  sick, but acting sick made you feel bad.
1910.20 1914.92 speaker3  I'm your prisoner, dammit.
1912.44 1921.88 speaker2  I think we should just go, let's go talk to her. Let's go talk to her. Worst case scenario, we push her into one of these feed and fish tanks.
1919.76 1925.44 speaker3  Just say, Hey, uh, Hey Frankie.
1924.44 1936.10 speaker2  I say that.
1933.26 1986.36 speaker1  where there are more people hanging. Most of them are unconscious and they are all hanging from a fish hook that is going through their crossed forearms. So their arms are crossed and through the spot where they are crossing, there is a fish hook going in both forearms. to hell fire and brimstone. You absolute piece of devil witch garbage.
1984.84 1995.06 speaker3  And then I'd poke him in the eye.
1992.26 1998.94 speaker1  As you guys continue, you do see that one of the...
1996.56 2006.54 speaker3  Is there anybody else here that I recognize or no?
1998.94 2073.26 speaker1  Yeah, as you scan the rest of the faces, you do recognize the body of agent Trent Chad also hanging from one of these fish hooks and his eyes rise up to meet yours and he freaks the fuck out.
2072.26 2077.66 speaker2  You can definitely wink at him.
2075.92 2166.88 speaker1  He spits it, Keith. I keep looking forward. All right. As you guys are going, you can hear Francis beans. Who started the fucking outbreak in contention? Who did it? Kathy piston spits. I told you, I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. Where? Okay, like where is the residue collecting then? Like you've been in contention this whole time. So like, just fucking tell me, is the residue collecting in any specific spot? lever and she is slowly lowering George piston toward this water. George begins actually whimpering as he's lowered towards this water and Kathy looks I, I just, I don't think I have any of the answers that you're, and she gets cut off by Francis again. Who's like, yeah. Okay. You of all people should fucking know that. And Kathy just spits at her client confidentiality and then Francis says, all right, well, or
2165.88 2177.82 speaker2  Yeah.
2172.92 2226.32 speaker1  Francis says, were they, uh, like, you know, at the circle or were they in contention? Have you ever seen any of these things? I'm not gonna George, George, I love you. I love you. And George is being dipped slowly into the water and as his feet touch, he starts moaning out. a service right now and just let me. And if you guys are still walking, you're approaching right now.
2223.24 2253.18 speaker2  that makes me just want to fucking stop this immediately. Nope. What? Just talk like you normally do. Yeah.
2249.54 2258.46 speaker1  company finally, wait, what the fuck is he doing here?
2257.46 2269.48 speaker2  Yeah. He killed Stan Manstein. What the fuck? So we're bringing him to Marvin to have a little conversation, try to figure out what we can do if we can, you know, I just, I didn't want to come back empty handed. So I brought you something.
2268.48 2289.92 speaker1  All right. Well, like you were sent down here, weren't you? Yeah. Okay. Then like, I guess hang him up and we'll talk to him now. Give me a second. God damn it. Francis.
2287.34 2298.30 speaker3  I'm sorry.
2296.12 2299.30 speaker1  Like when did he tell you that leaving?
2298.30 2326.88 speaker3  I'm sorry. you leaving him here dangling, not tortured. You should torture him a little more.
2321.66 2350.60 speaker1  I think we should hang him up right now and fucking torture him until he starts talking. So like, uh, just hold on. Just hold on right there. I'm seriously, I'm deadly in the middle of something right now. And she begins lowering George.
2347.80 2363.92 speaker2  Can I get a plus for my heavy metal hand? Yep.
2362.92 2378.48 speaker1  God damn it. It's going to be a pretty fucking important dexterity check. What's your dexterity?
2377.48 2391.44 speaker2  Doesn't matter. It's one 91.
2387.16 2412.88 speaker1  momentum against you and throws you directly into the water. God damn it. So as you splash into the water, I need you to roll a sanity check. Just him.
2411.88 2422.88 speaker2  Okay. 26 on him.
2417.60 2458.72 speaker1  As you begin fucking panicking at the thought of what is underneath you right now. Just like the one I'm in right now. that you saw inside there. Are these multiple tanks or one giant tank?
2456.16 2465.32 speaker2  Oh, it is not even close. You can't even see the edge.
2464.32 2472.82 speaker3  Help me. Can I, in the confusion of his assail, heaven helps those who help themselves.
2471.08 2479.84 speaker1  So Clark actually does get first action.
2478.84 2501.54 speaker3  I'm rolling unarmed. Well, when Keith went for her and swung wide or whatever happened there, I just seized that opportunity because she wouldn't have been looking at the prisoner and I just walk up and wallop her.
2500.54 2505.82 speaker1  Alrighty.
2501.54 2507.82 speaker3  Go ahead and roll a D6 for damage here.
2506.82 2526.46 speaker1  Alrighty. You punch her in the head. Roll that law check for me. So you go to hand. Okay.
2525.46 2538.26 speaker3  You guys curse dice.
2532.98 2563.94 speaker1  She uses his momentum against him and throws him into the water below. Clark goes swings, punches her, makes a connection as Jon goes around the back and tries to get her hands in handcuffs. She wriggles out of his grasp and she kind of backs away and she goes to take off running. She's going to run toward where you guys came from. And it is Keith's turn. What are you doing?
2556.90 2571.38 speaker2  I pull the big, huge gun off my back and I try to use the magazine clips to reach up to the catwalk and, you know, kind of hike it in there and pull myself up out of the
2570.38 2583.62 speaker1  That's very smart. So I'm going to have you roll athletics in order to kick your legs hard enough to lift your body out of the water enough. Oh boy.
2582.62 2587.10 speaker2  55 on a 50.
2586.10 2604.52 speaker3  Right there.
2598.50 2611.94 speaker1  you accidentally click, I'm guessing, a button on a gun that makes a clip pop out and then the gun slips out of your hands and falls into the water out of your...
2610.94 2615.22 speaker2  You rolled a crit fail.
2612.26 2641.26 speaker1  And you took it off your back too. I like where your head's at, but you done fucked up and you lost your gun. It's in the water and it is floating down into the darkness past where you can see. You can barely see your feet in this murky, dark green water. And above you, this clip is lodged into the catwalk. Clark, it is your turn. She is running away from you currently. Oh, that's right. Do you want to chase after her?
2640.26 2666.38 speaker3  Yeah. What kind of role would I need for that? Do I have a run skill? Well, okay. The problem is that... What would Clark do? Know what I'm going to do? I'm going to turn and help Keith out of the pool.
2665.38 2669.98 speaker1  Yeah. Take that free action and go ahead and holler.
2668.98 2683.22 speaker3  Francis! The blood just got riled up. You know, family. Get back here. You've got torturing to do.
2680.66 2701.12 speaker1  How are you helping Keith out of the pool? 54 and a 35. Amazing.
2698.40 2702.12 speaker2  Can I do a persuade roll on yelling at her?
2701.12 2731.00 speaker1  Yeah, absolutely. All righty. And she rolled a 98 to try to fight your persuade. And so she stops and she turns around. She's like, crushed her in my mind vice. Yeah.
2728.32 2745.44 speaker3  Come get him, help get him out and then you can torture.
2743.16 2764.96 speaker1  you were trying to handcuff her. And so she's now telling you to get ahold of the prisoner that you had. Right. The person I just tried to handcuff. Exactly. I'll definitely count all that.
2763.96 2780.10 speaker2  So smart.
2772.62 2853.74 speaker1  And with that absolutely dog shit luck roll that you had earlier, that was for the timing of the whole situation. And looking down as you hold on to the body of George piston, you feel this movement from underneath you and you can hear water moving at a rapid pace and looking down, you actually see the creature. It is moving so quickly toward you that all of the grime in the water that is in between you and it is starting to dissipate as it's coming toward you. And you see a clear picture of one of these mutated fish men. But like the one that you saw earlier, it looks exactly like the ones in the Brown jumpsuits, but it is four times larger. And both of its legs are kind of like welded together like this one giant fin. It opens its maw and swims up right at you. Clark it's your turn. What are you doing?
2851.24 2875.96 speaker3  I heard the exchange about the cuff thing. And so I'm going to try and play it cool. I'm just going to stand back up and that's it. I mean, yeah.
2871.54 2935.20 speaker1  George Piston is hollering to his God. Keith Vigna is crawling up the body of George Piston. Clark Bishop is standing on the catwalk with his hands behind his back. And Francis beans is running toward Kevin in her eyes. John Lee Pettymore to try to grab Keith when all of a sudden this giant fish mouth comes up from in between the catwalk grid and grabs wholly on to George Piston's body, closes its mouth and dips back into the water. The fish hook is just hanging right above the water covered in blood. And there's a giant splash in the water hits all of your feet. And the four of you stand there in the wake of the disappearance of Keith Vigna and George Piston.
