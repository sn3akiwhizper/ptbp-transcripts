It's your mother hen wolf the dog And I'm here to nest upon all of the eggs of contention hatching them into my own personal chicken army I'm clucking at you live from 694.2 PTBP as always my chickadees Real quick before we get up and started the boys from pretended to be people wanted me to let you know they are accepting Questions for a third Q&A Episode so if you have questions for any of the monsters that make that show tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram There will also be a post in the subreddit where you can comment your questions or post them on our Facebook page Fuck you mark fucker burg or email them to pretending pod at gmail.com Or and seriously y'all should go do this go all out record audio of you asking your questions And send that so they can use it in the episode much like the second Q&A episode This one will be for our honorary police officers over on patreon who keep this show alive five bucks a month at a time Speaking of things my producer forces me to read each week We got a new howling at wolf for y'all This week's is from at mad under dash seed who tweeted about the show and tagged at pretending pod It reads as follows if you're not sure what kind of officer you're dealing with from contention PD Madeline man, I miss seeing those officers in the future There may be more questionable content for you to throw even more of your hard-earned money at in the future Mankind is designed inclined and resigned to die It's time for the news Last time Ken Krenkelhoff Liz Longlin and Jeremy Pettymore came across a large frame hanging in the woods Can realized an old memory was closer to reality than he had hoped but he was able to disable a trap that otherwise would have put a giant wooden spear through someone's mouth and out the back of the head through the broken canvas in the frame the susceptible to being scared of cliches Freaked out grabbed the spear and charged toward the cabin and then he disappeared into a pile of leaves But a man in a black suit with a bolo tie came out of nowhere to interrogate him Now this next sentence may sound a bit kooky But agent Kevin came back with a woman named agent Karen who chanted over a machete and then in one swift motion Took off ashes arm in the middle of his forearm Stranger still the wound immediately cauterized and flesh grew to form a nub They took ash to a black car hidden in thick brush where they are set up to stake out a cabin in the woods Sharon shadow Berryman somewhere between unaware and Purposefully oblivious followed Krista Kringlehoff off the path into the darkness and directly into a skip bow trap Right around the ankle it then became clear that perhaps Krista Kringlehoff isn't quite herself Judy Kringlehoff having seen the body of the state ranger ed buzz Woodrow all spineless and shit walked back out into the darkness the rain The parking lot of the contention woods and then she made a terrible decision That is definitely not a trash can to that moment in the shivering wet Darkness lit only by strikes of lightning in the distance. It's blue false indigo with
320.94 363.30 speaker2  Time has come to Dance beneath a dance beneath the shadow of the moon
361.50 397.06 speaker3  blood-covered Krista Kringlehoff Who is walking? Directly toward you The raccoon at your side Shivers something fierce and is like
391.14 420.26 speaker1  Like into the parking lot trying to get to the street, okay, but not running back towards the shack hell no I state I stay there cuz I'm first of all Freaking out from the body and I am not sure what to think of my mom. So I I stand there Judy
417.22 436.70 speaker3  She was not trying to help look for Liz at all in fact, she she told me she told me that she wanted to just run back to the woods with her and And and told me to come back out here
434.70 453.80 speaker2  I'm so scared for you Maybe we should go back up to the shack and I'll see if I can find some band-aids in your purse to help fix
449.02 479.02 speaker1  I'm like holding on to her and helping her walk and then as soon as we get to the shack
474.74 685.28 speaker3  You feel a pinch on the back of your neck and when you turn around you see that your mom's body has crumpled to the ground and Standing in front of you its metallic arms shoved into the ground and the ceiling and the walls of the shack in The middle of which is a small one inch in diameter metal sphere One of these tendrils reaches around with another tendril it snaps Judy Krenkelhoff's neck forward and rips out her spine shoving itself Into the spinal column and filling it and You Allie are now playing this entity All of these details, but you are an objective based Entity and your objective is to collect as many Bodies as possible So your goal Allie is to get one-on-one with one of the other players and pass off this entity So, you know that you came to the woods as Judy Krenkelhoff With shadow and Liz and you know that you were out there to do a spell or a ritual But that is all the information from Judy Krenkelhoff that you know, everything else will just have to be hog shit and horse lies Makes improv easier. I Told my parents about this podcast. My dad was like, so you just lie quick It's like yep. He's like you're gonna be good at that Alright, Joe Mud and sludge is making this slide a bit more Liquid and thick viscous. However still enough to slide you down and you are sliding for some time before you land underneath this cabin
683.28 741.68 speaker1  Oh Shit, it's wood. Can I look up back? What if I had said stone? I know I wasn't sure Can I look back up the slide? I just came down. Can I see any daylight or I mean moonlight?
739.68 750.04 speaker3  Go ahead and roll dexterity
748.60 762.80 speaker1  32 on a
755.96 803.84 speaker3  Horizontal with where you are. It would not be able to stand up as you remember it being longer than you Can I okay, you know how long you are as a human? So therefore there's no slats of wood of you under a door
799.52 843.74 speaker1  Maybe I have a flashlight on me. Is there a role to determine if I had a flashlight on me? Yeah, absolutely It'll burn the wood. It's so bright. I
839.64 896.68 speaker3  But this doesn't seem like a place that is often used However, you do see what looks like maybe floor supports However, they are tube like in nature and as you flash the flashlight Over them you see that they are translucent tubes that are filled from above into the ground below
892.06 908.70 speaker1  Can he get any purchase to get back up the slide that he came down? Oh interesting I don't think he would want to be going into the house if he could help it. Yeah, that makes sense
903.98 934.24 speaker3  Athletics check are you bringing the spear or no? Yeah, that's not gonna leave my side Sludge in this area that it's like the Japanese game show slippery stairs. That's what I was picturing and
931.34 977.84 speaker1  You're not green. Dang. Yeah should have bet on blue Okay, then I am going to cautiously approach the Cautiously approach the door and I want to put my ear to it. Do I hear any sounds on the other side? We'll find out after we
970.18 1387.42 speaker3  Ashhorn beam walks to this black sedan and this four-wheeler that are out in the middle of these woods in this thick of brush of trees and Agent Kevin looks at you. All right It's raining. It's dark, but he doesn't it takes him about three seconds Which seems like five minutes and he hops into the back of the car and when you hop into the back of this black Sedan sitting in the back seat on the other side is a man who is quite tall it's wearing the same black suit white shirt black tie and he's blonde but his hair is like buzzed and he's in his early 30s and Nice to meet you ash looks over at him doesn't say anything Buckles his seat belt and looks straight at the ground or the floor of the car Looking at the floorboards you see that there's a bunch of electrical spool wiring I'm sorry He's immediately intrigued he starts looking at the spool on the floorboard and he's immediately reminded of The time that him and his father set up fireworks display for the town for contention and Ash gets super excited. He looks at the FBI agent opens up his jacket a little bit to reveal what I called water dynamite sure and then I show him the other side of my jacket, which is two sticks of actual dynamite and I I was trying to do a port of relaxing As you're looking out ahead of you you see this cabin that's sitting out in this small clearing and Outside the cabin you see that there is sack is scrolling on his computer I'm I'm Intrigued and worried there seems to be some sort of outdoor building almost like a pod, you know Like a storage locker kind of unit thing. Yeah There's one of those and there's also a big yellow excavator sitting outside and you had our pillar yeah, exactly and You would also notice that there is a moat that surrounds this cabin You can't tell how wide it is or how deep it is because you're still pretty far away But you can see glinting off the surface of this water is the moonlight and that's how you kind of catch that There's water there and then you see to the left of the cabin movement outside the moat or yes, yeah about 25 yards out and You see Liz lonklin is with your two friends Jeremy Pettymore and Ken Krenkelhoff and they are like And throws it on the ground and you see this wooden spear seven feet long Just like flies in their direction and then hits a tree immediately Ken Crabs this giant wooden spear out of the tree and takes off running and as he takes off running Towards the cabin still like 20 yards away from the moat at this point. He just disappears He like falls into the ground running away or towards and he falls into the ground and is completely out of sight Kevin looks in the rearview mirror and he's like, oh, do you uh, do you know them and he looks back and he's like We were looking around this place is just chock full of traps. Well, what is this place? You know that mad you were talking about? Yeah, I don't know if that's her name or if that's her name now, but Kind of just a reason to get us out here, but overall sanity for me Well, it means you take max damage, which was gonna be a d4 plus one. So you lose five sanity I don't get to roll my d4. No, you do not you automatically take maximum For this game here And so when you lose five or more sanity in a single loss
1387.14 1394.14 speaker1  All right
1387.42 1429.18 speaker3  So Luke basically you're given the option fight flight or faint you need to rank them and most likely to least likely You're gonna fight if you roll a four or five you're gonna faint and if you roll a six you're gonna flight Am I rolling a d6 d6 for me?
1426.58 1444.18 speaker1  Which is that is listener
1436.50 1460.86 speaker3  Someone's birthday. He's the nicest person. He just knows that you and I are those kids like the kids birthday party
1458.86 1469.98 speaker1  We had fun
1464.34 1495.34 speaker3  What do you think I got I think you got a six I got a six on your slump the slump in your shoulders Yeah, I got a six. So I think that's a flight. That is a flight. Damn it That works out really well for me personally. I'm sure I'd leave the room. Yeah, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Bye. Bye
1493.34 1515.34 speaker2  You
1509.26 1608.90 speaker3  What just fucking disappear into the ground ahead of you and it begins to rain I need you both through all sanity. I need it 27 on 75 damn he has good sanity. That's like the one good thing of all these characters Liz is gonna start to freak out a little bit. You're out here. You don't know what part of the woods you're in You've never seen this cabin before Ken Krenkelhoff Prominent player in the stylus Cole K through 12 community just disappeared not only into the ground But also off of your list of suitable bachelors
1604.42 1625.98 speaker1  Okay, so where we are I'm going and see yeah a little bit Yeah, we saw okay
1620.02 1853.88 speaker3  So moving up to the hole you would see that he slid into like a pile of leaves That turned into a mudslide pit It looks like the top of a slide that's made out of sludge that Disappears at an angle into the ground and then looking forward you see the cabin It's far more well lit. Now. The lights are on inside so you can see it from you know, the window lights I suppose however, you can also see in the moonlight that outside there is a storage container seemingly like a small rectangular box separate from the cabin itself as well as Big yellow excavator sitting outside the cabin and about ten yards away from the cabin encircling it is a moat and The moonlight is reflecting off of the water of this moat Both of you roll an alertness check for me. Actually, whoever's got a better alertness will count 50 same I rolled a 31 beautiful We'll use that as you also notice that there are some fish flopping up out of the water base
1848.84 1878.40 speaker1  Why don't you make a human rusty is easily six foot three and I want him to make a human bridge
1872.08 2059.42 speaker3  I'll just like I'll toss some Smokies to the other like sure and I'll hold his feet as he leaps across for them step on his balls Rusty has his ankles on one shore being held by Jeremy petty more and he reaches out for the tiny meat fingers on the other side of the moat and he Grasps onto the ground on the other side and as soon as he makes that bridge connection you know like when two grandmas become friends Liz lonklin just You know when you stub your toe on a taint Hazardly throws his arms about thrashing in this fish filled water for more flesh pencils Jumping over this five-foot wide moat and he is with okay
2054.34 2073.14 speaker1  I want to leave Smokies like a like a little just a little trail the whole way I go
2065.26 2137.78 speaker3  One of the buildings is much smaller and is the size of like a small storage pod that you see sometimes in people's driveways like before or after a move and Then you have the cabin which has a front porch and a single door window on either side of the door Jeremy petty more. What are you doing? I'm I rolled an 85 so you stumble up the Stairs to the front porch of this cabin and like slam your hands down on the wooden porch And then you walk up and you stick your head up in the window and looking inside You see a lot of equipment that you have never seen in your entire life before this is not a home this is a lab and
2135.42 2143.38 speaker2  Was just waiting for him to say that I
2138.50 2150.02 speaker3  We're not talking about the OA. Okay, at the end they stop a school shooting with their
2148.02 2160.38 speaker2  You can just cut this watch the whole thing
2157.70 2170.98 speaker1  Heard it was good, but I can't imagine now. That's true
2165.02 2251.46 speaker3  Looking inside all of this equipment is completely outside your grasp. However, you see these translucent tubes that are running all over the place up the walls along the ceiling and Then they're going down into the floorboard underneath and they are all filled with a squeamish black Viscous goo that is making its way below the cabin around on the other sides You see a desk littered with papers so many papers strewn about there's like a cork board with a bunch of more papers Thumb tacked up to it and you see in the corner of the room. There is a large wooden trunk You don't come across the storage yet
2246.02 2275.78 speaker1  I know so everything you do affects the future. Mm-hmm. What would you like to do Jeremy petty more?
2274.58 2334.60 speaker3  small Rectangular room as you do so a light comes on inside It's dimly lit But as you walk in or poke your head in You see one side is a closet full of outfits on the other side of the room Are the bodies of? roughly 15 people they are all hanging on hooks from a hole in the back of their neck and The way they are slumped makes you think that none of them have a spinal cord
2332.60 2367.92 speaker2  Roll sanity
2362.24 2373.40 speaker3  And you see Jeremy petty more fucking book it out of this small external room
2368.88 2418.96 speaker2  You're up on the porch, what do you do I run run towards the guy that helped us over the moat
2416.96 2489.34 speaker3  Lethality rule so Oh The two of you take off running you throw down rusty across the moat you make it to the other side you leave some Micro pains on the other side and as you dip into the woods Liz you hear a click underneath your foot And before you can let the breath out a giant metal claw Swings down from the branch on the tree above you and takes your head clean off as blood begins Burt out of the body above you and blood is literally showering like Vegas water feature style out of the space in between your shoulders and You fall to your knees like shooting a guy in the dick and double-oh-seven you like hit your knees and then you hit your shoulders on the ground
2484.40 2504.20 speaker1  Jeremy petty more roll a sanity check Jeremy petty more doesn't see any of Jeremy petty more didn't see
2500.60 2504.20 speaker3  He sees it he knows that he's the survivor and he keeps going Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
