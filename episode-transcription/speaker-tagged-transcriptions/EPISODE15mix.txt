0.00 197.28 speaker0  Hola, que pasa mis perros, esta es Wolf the dog. On this week's edition of Howlin' with Wolf, we got ourselves a beautiful poem written by a listener who gave us a five-star review on iTunes. That was a super cool thing to do, listener. She writes, My dearest Samuel, You are the ying to my yang, The chicken tendies to my basement dweller, The window to my wall, The sweat that drips down my balls, You really butter my bread and stain my bits, I love you even if you keep taking weird pictures of my paddle-board feet, Wow, that is so fuckin' gross, It gives me wet in the eye-holes, Now, wholesome news, Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use. This is the cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of a missing person. The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals. The names of the deceased are not yet being released, my babies. More importantly, however, the officers of law here in contention eat the most awful breakfast food. The officers are also dealing with the situation wherein Officer Bishop seems to be in more than one place at a time. He has no recollection of this. Then, a lot of super important plot stuff happens, involving the FBI agents, the black Nike bag, a small silver sphere, and things of that nature. It seems like our boys at the local precinct might be getting called up to the big show. playing in a show March 2nd at some place called the Front of House Lounge. In honor of this actual event, we are premiering a brand new song by Kudzu.
191.64 203.76 speaker1  I have Joe with me here today, and we are joined by a long-time Delta Green player and
202.76 213.92 speaker0  And... My wife!
211.36 247.16 speaker1  So let's go ahead and get right into it. Let's flash back to a time when Clark Bishop was a much, much younger man. One might even call him a boy. So you are in your childhood home, which just so happens to be, if I'm not mistaken, to be the home that Clark Bishop still lives in. Do you want to give a quick description of what it looks like back then?
244.62 279.02 speaker0  Yeah, it's real clean. It's one of those houses that keeps the plastic on the couch. Maybe a framed picture of Jesus. Is it tatting? The little doilies and things on armchairs? Yeah. Tatted. Yeah. Awesome.
277.00 300.94 speaker1  are in the kitchen making dinner. Pat Sajak is loud and clear over the television, and as you're playing in the living room,
299.70 309.62 speaker2  I had the frog in my throat.
303.58 350.86 speaker1  And they're jawing back and forth, and you're looking over on the walls, you got all the pictures of the Jesus, the crosses, you got some angels. I don't know, maybe like a family picture of you guys on vacation somewhere. And your mom walks over as your dad keeps working on dinner. goes into its final clue in the bonus round.
349.86 362.70 speaker2  library?
360.70 376.30 speaker1  Yeah, go say hi to Mr. Fingerson. Tell him that we send our guards and oh, also. And she goes and grabs a little basket of muffins, lemon poppy seed muffins.
375.30 387.58 speaker2  Mr. Fingerson?
381.54 439.26 speaker1  So off we see little Clark Bishop riding a bike, maybe, or contentions in small town. You could easily ride your bike. When you go in there, you would see it's dead. It's dead. It's a really nice place. The general's a little musty in here. However, you do see that at the information desk, Mr. Fingerson is having a conversation His name is Gary Daley and he runs the Pho Shop in town. He is having a very loud conversation with Mr. Fingerson.
436.10 450.78 speaker2  The true and horrifying confessions of the St. Oscyth witches. Yes, of course.
448.26 454.62 speaker1  of stuff that is right up my alley.
452.58 489.42 speaker2  We have quite a bit in the occult. I can surely gather some materials for you. Tell me, what are you going to be reading these for? See nothing, I don't know. I completely agree. Often I feel in contention. I don't feel fulfilled.
483.10 491.90 speaker1  Jerry Daley walks away with his book and kind of denotes where he's going to be sitting.
490.42 499.30 speaker2  Well, I'm going to be right over here. Oh, Clark, thank goodness you're here. Hey, Mr. Fingerson. Oh, please call me Gerald. All right, Gerald.
498.30 502.30 speaker1  No, no, no.
501.30 533.84 speaker2  Oh, of course. Extend that short O. That's very close. We'll keep working on it. It's only been, what, seven months that we've been practicing? Oh, I'm sure you will. And what brings you here today? If only I weren't gluten intolerant. Yes, she sure does.
532.84 561.64 speaker0  That's probably why.
553.52 571.60 speaker1  about life, and then the phone in the contention public library begins to ring. Ring, ring. Ring, ring. Thank you. I was going to do that in post, but I think we don't need it anymore. No, we're going to keep that.
569.68 575.76 speaker0  And that's going to be the phone sound for the rest of the podcast.
574.76 582.96 speaker1  You're welcome. It will be used from here on out.
579.56 588.96 speaker2  Hello, this is Gerald.
587.96 610.76 speaker1  Tell him. Tell him he was already given the best letters. You have to tell him.
607.28 641.56 speaker2  Clark, I believe you got a phone call. He told you you have the best letters. He sounded panicked, and then he screamed a little.
632.80 697.52 speaker1  The sun was still out, you know, late summer, and the sky turns, and it is dark before you know it. Like, it is not time for sunset, however, the sun is no longer shining over contention. And you immediately see these figures start moving outside the windows, and you can't make them out, but something is moving around outside the library. You kind of look over, and you see the front doors, and you see this dark figure in the darkness behind him, shrouded. He's clearly wearing a cloak, and he is locking the doors of the library with a massive chain, and he's locking you into the library. As soon as he finishes, he turns and runs, and out of the windows, you see a bright flash of light.
695.34 731.16 speaker2  My God, what is happening? Mr. Finkerson, did you see that? Well, I sure did. Let's go take a look. Seems something's finally interesting is happening in contention. Interesting is, I guess, one way to put it. Yes, don't you worry, Clark. I'm your mentor. I will take care of this. So I go over and take a peek out of one of the windows.
728.92 760.96 speaker1  When you go over and take a peek out of the windows, I'm picturing... Oh, also, real quick, what does Mr. Finkerson look like? We don't do that here. We don't do that here. That's what all the other actual play podcasts do. So we'd like to give a quick physical description using two to three descriptive words.
759.96 787.28 speaker3  Okay. Sweater vest. All right, you already used two. of my nose.
785.80 809.04 speaker1  A sweater vest and bifocals that are low on the bridge of my nose. As you look out the window... Oh, that's a good look.
806.04 816.48 speaker3  The glasses aren't even real, they're just like for to be trendy.
813.20 818.48 speaker1  So we see, what's your fucking name? Gerald.
817.48 827.28 speaker3  Gerald.
822.48 856.72 speaker1  So we see Gerald Fingersen looking out, creeping along and looking out this window and a young Clark kind of peeking out from behind him and this massive, massive shadow moves right out of frame and you actually see this man. He's a very tall man wearing a black suit and he is sprinting away and following him is this completely cloaked figure who is running after him into the darkness of the night.
855.50 857.72 speaker0  That's happening outside the windows?
856.72 869.68 speaker1  That's happening outside the window. It would have previously been like 5.30pm, maybe even 6.
868.44 879.60 speaker2  Mr. Fingersen, do you know who that was? I sure don't and there's only a population of...
877.76 900.52 speaker1  So let's not.
895.52 907.44 speaker0  Just geographically, would that guy have been, should he have been running from the library or could he have been coming from somewhere else?
905.00 920.24 speaker1  Oh, they were coming from the library. No. No, they're just running away from the library. 20 yards. Okay.
919.24 933.36 speaker3  And then...
929.04 945.92 speaker2  Dear boy, I'd like you to get behind the reference center. I do believe I'm going to try to interact with them. And then I go try to open a window.
938.68 964.48 speaker1  When you open up the window, light actually comes back into the world and both figures that you saw running away are no longer within sight. However, based on how fast they were running and how far away they were and the flatness of the land, you should still be able to see them, but you no longer can.
961.80 977.52 speaker3  Okay, I'm going to go see if the lock is still on the door. It's normal, but there's a lock on the door.
976.00 987.60 speaker0  that it's kind of light out. I want to look at Mr. Daley.
980.76 993.00 speaker1  Mr. Daley is sitting staring at this book and he looks at you and he's like, was there
990.94 1031.40 speaker2  Maybe Mr. Daley. It seemed pretty dark for a cloud though. That was crazy. I've read those occult books frontwards and backwards in my many years alone in the library and I do believe that they have something to do with this. Mr. Daley, I think we must have a sit and talk.
1025.94 1085.94 speaker0  There was an article that my favorite murder is the most listened to podcast in Missouri. How interesting. listened to. They're good.
1083.94 1131.16 speaker2  What are you, a little pussy? Sorry. Mr. Daley, do not talk to my son. her, she said it was hungry.
1124.68 1159.08 speaker1  cleared and sayeth that Sucken did plague Biet's wife unto death and other plague three of his beasts where of two of them died. These spirits of a dog and a lion that made a, I don't think, I don't know if that has anything to do with this, but that's pretty cool.
1156.04 1163.92 speaker0  seeing if the sun's blinking out or anything.
1162.92 1169.88 speaker1  Nothing out of the ordinary.
1168.88 1212.60 speaker2  another encounter. Perhaps a formative experience will happen to you that will unveil this again. Thank you for calling me a gentleman.
1211.60 1408.48 speaker1  Cool. You killed it. I made it. You fucking killed it. falter. Your mind effectively breaks, shattering into different realities, and these different scenes play out in front of you, but they're constantly changing like a television flipping through the channels. First, you see your house exactly as you know it. Then it's on fire. Next, the house is normal, but there are police officers and vehicles everywhere, and yellow tape surrounds your home. One after another, relentlessly, the scene changes around you. There are a couple black sedans out front. Now everything is normal again. Now it's a wasteland. Your surroundings continue to vacillate as you approach the door of your home. A man in a suit hops out of a black sedan and hollers to get your attention as you open your front door. Inside is quiet. Looking down the hallway, you notice something's off. There are more wall decorations than normal. Your reality breaks again. Everything's back to the way it always has been. You hear the sounds of Wheel of Fortune, but the sound of the wheel spinning just goes and goes and goes, and you hear voices all around you and inside of you. Your vision flickers back to your unacceptable reality. In the hallway, there are not more pictures of a happy family, or of angels' wings, or of Jesus. Instead, suspended a couple feet off the ground as if they had been halfway quicksanded into the wall, the parents of Clark Bishop, your parents, have become interior design. Their knees jutting out into the hallway, their hands grasping out for life, their faces contorted in anguish and disbelief. A voice snaps you out of it. You look up and see a cold, vacant woman smiling out from behind the thick, asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes. All you can remember about that day is how perfectly normal it all was. How your house looked completely empty. They weren't there anymore. There was very little evidence in the trial, but the words of Anne Love's confession haunt you as you try desperately to remember anything about that abhorrent day. I did it, and I'd do it again.
1406.88 1415.92 speaker2  It's like D&D, but it's like X-Files.
1414.16 1419.04 speaker0  I never think to use the X-Files analogy. That's what I always say. It's good.
1417.92 1462.52 speaker1  Luke got it from me. That's awesome. Dick. I think we're gonna suck Alex's dick all weekend. it's this weekend. I'll never see them again.
1461.52 1465.04 speaker0  And it ticks a few boxes.
1462.52 1506.04 speaker1  And Alex is leading the party. His last hurrah of being single would be fucking 12 dudes. 11. 11. Or, yeah, I hope none of us get dragged by a cop underwater. Oops. No, like, nothing happened to that cop, right? Nothing happened to that cop. I didn't know this was a real thing.
1504.20 1510.68 speaker0  They handcuffed a guy in a lake and he couldn't swim?
1509.68 1515.68 speaker1  drowned. Nobody got him.
1514.68 1521.04 speaker0  That's a big ol' oopsie.
1520.04 1522.04 speaker1  I'm pretty sure.
1521.04 1524.04 speaker0  I mean, it's Keith's shit. Like, straight up.
1523.04 1531.32 speaker1  Straight up. Hard. That's us.
1530.32 1538.44 speaker0  Was it here? Was it at Lake of the Ozarks? Well, that's just a ticket in Missouri.
1537.44 1666.76 speaker1  Duly noted. I didn't mean to accidentally kill him. Bean Boy. You ready to boot-skootin' Biggie? Well, I'm good. That's your third last puff. I know. Okay, so Agent Kennedy looks at you guys and she says, And Kennedy and Billy Harrison turn around and walk out of the police station. Before they do that... They did, yeah. Yeah, that was just, like, getting us back in. Well, shit. I'd be like, wait, what the fuck? What is this number? Who are you? What are you talking about? Please fill us in. We're in what? You've just added more mystery to our, like, horribly chaotic lives. Yeah, how about you're too stunned by the recent revelations that have been brought to your attention to say anything. She also confirmed that weird shit exists. Yeah, weird shit is happening, but... Like she is letting you hold onto a Nike bag that makes things disappear, and she was desperately trying to get rid of a small silver sphere, and Billy Harrison, the bald guy from Charles Donovan's trunk, is one of them, and, okay, how about this. On the back of the paper with the phone number, it says, your job is to stop the incursion, But the ink disappears after you read it, and on the other side, the phone number is still there. Did you really say call this number in 48 hours? With in.
1665.76 1670.08 speaker0  With in, yeah. Oh, with in. They are gonna call us in 48 hours if we don't.
1669.08 1681.08 speaker1  If we don't call them first. Gotcha. I thought it was call when you've completed. That also.
1678.64 1695.72 speaker0  thing up to save it from being exposed.
1693.52 1823.34 speaker1  Have any of us used luck at all? None of you have used. I thought you did once. No one has used any luck so far. Exactly. And so, let's go ahead and change the economy of luck at the beginning of this session. I will award you all five luck. You all gain five luck. I'm at 65. And only a math problem away from 420. Is that even one, or did you just say syllables and ended it at three? Harg-Barkerman. I said Op-Crockleman. No. Nice. doing the cool stuff you do. you think that you deserve luck, go ahead and call me out and be like, can I get some Exactly. I know there's only two of you, but I'm doing automatic gratuity. I kind of knocked it out of the park with y'all. Yeah, so that's allowed. And also... Okay, I think I deserve more luck. You don't. So from here on out, let's go ahead and do that. And hopefully the luck economy can start changing more throughout. I'm hoping not only will I try to put you in situations where maybe luck is more necessary, that's just going to happen based on the story that we're playing.
1822.34 1824.34 speaker0  No.
1823.34 1841.08 speaker1  Okay, well... I'm going to short luck, Joe.
1840.08 1849.28 speaker0  So... Why would he make that bet? Yeah, like I give you luck if I'm lucky?
1844.08 1851.18 speaker1  Yeah, and if you're not, then I give you a little bit of luck and you get some anyway.
1849.28 1863.58 speaker3  Let's think about this later.
1857.96 1876.60 speaker0  probably reiterate, so uh, what do you feel this like, that old man, that the world isn't That's super hero shit.
1874.78 1887.82 speaker1  To save humanity. Why did you become a police officer, Keith?
1886.82 1905.90 speaker0  So the...
1904.90 1931.82 speaker1  in the class. I wasn't the top of my class, but... Yeah, I graduated from the police academy. I also love the movie police academy, that's one reason, cause I was hoping that I'd work with somebody that could make cool noises. You could be the cool noises guy. I don't really have any skills. Try a helicopter. Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.
1930.82 1933.82 speaker3  It's been super easy.
1932.82 1970.82 speaker1  It's been super easy. It's been super easy. It's been super easy. Okay, so we, we have no information about what she just said, but I feel like it makes sense.
1967.22 1971.82 speaker0  Do you think the incursion could be that black oily goo we've been seeing?
1970.82 1982.42 speaker1  It seems like exactly... Dude, we should find out what this bag is made out of and make a big, big one and just
1981.42 1984.42 speaker3  put it...
1983.42 1998.10 speaker1  Over the town. Like a dome. And yeah, it, it just worked.
1997.10 2002.22 speaker3  Yeah.
2001.22 2014.20 speaker0  I think you described it. Like a wet-vac? H-vac?
2012.26 2028.10 speaker1  It also had a hose, like a wand. Should we put an alert out for all citizens to be at the ready? I think that was unrelated. Yeah, I don't know about that.
2027.10 2032.18 speaker3  Was that not kind of where you guys were?
2031.18 2048.46 speaker0  Okay, yeah. They probably just ran away.
2047.46 2054.42 speaker1  going to go to. Yeah, at the end. It was the mill?
2052.82 2057.62 speaker3  The mill, the church, because the church has a helmet.
2054.42 2081.46 speaker1  The third place was investigating the chief's father, but that's the mill. and the mill and the chief's father. Like any break-ins, random home? What about the trashings?
2080.46 2100.10 speaker0  It's...
2099.10 2146.06 speaker1  Okay. I'll send them right over. Uh, hey, officers, Gary Daley has information about the chief's house blowing up. You guys would know that Gary Daley is the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and he's also the owner operator of The Daily Pho. The Daily Pho? The Daily Pho?
2143.22 2148.06 speaker0  Let's, uh, I think we should not split up as long as possible. Not yet.
2147.06 2151.90 speaker1  No, yeah. I still want you guys in here.
2150.06 2154.30 speaker3  I'm kind of a lone wolf, but I'll stick with you guys for now.
2153.30 2156.30 speaker0  Gary's. Okay.
2155.30 2246.66 speaker1  Yeah. He's at his place of business in northeast downtown is where The Daily Pho sits. When you guys walk in, there are lots of pictures hanging on the walls of the history of this restaurant, including one very large picture of four generations of Daley's, a young Gary Daley, his mother, grandmother, and great grandfather. They had all owned and operated this restaurant at one time or another. There are also a bunch of prints with black and white designs on them. One is a circle with a star inside of it. Inside that star is another star, and there are a couple of triangles, curved lines and tiny circles as well. Another is a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing Another print is a black circle with six black dots surrounding it. Another is a wonky question mark with lines, one curved and one straight jutting down from the question marks dot. And behind the counter comes walking an older man, but he dresses very hip. He's wearing jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short-sleeve button down with tiny cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it.
2240.90 2250.30 speaker2  hey, do you guys remember when I would help watch you down at clinkers when you were but
2249.30 2252.30 speaker3  Sure do.
2251.30 2261.32 speaker2  Good to see you again. Thanks.
2256.90 2265.62 speaker1  And he, uh, and he starts walking back to a little office in the, in the back of the
2262.32 2272.62 speaker0  Real quick, the symbols on the wall, were they like framed photos? How what were they? They're prints, right? They're prints. Okay. Yeah.
2271.62 2287.24 speaker1  Okay. Pretty artsy. Cool. We're back in the office at this point. Nice.
2286.24 2298.12 speaker3  Okay.
2297.12 2329.50 speaker1  He begins singing for you. Uh, what a beautiful lullaby Gary. We're at the daily fall. So I don't know if somebody wants to sit down or if you guys are all standing.
2328.50 2350.78 speaker3  So I'm going to sit down.
2345.66 2372.46 speaker1  blog these days and I wanted him to write a blog post about the daily fuss. when I realized where he was.
2365.02 2391.78 speaker2  Uh, didn't realize it was, it was that house at the time, but, uh, we saw, uh, I, I guess and uh, James, you know, James and uh, another guy got out.
2390.78 2440.98 speaker1  Yeah. He's just James. He works at the mill. Right. What do you, what do you mean? Just go ahead and finish your story. I thought that was really scary. that blog written.
2439.98 2451.02 speaker2  That's his name, right? Hey Gary.
2449.74 2461.66 speaker0  Did she, did she look scared? Did she look like she'd been hurt previously?
2460.42 2481.38 speaker1  look herself. That's for sure. You know, she, she wasn't, she wasn't standing tall and proud like, like chief cook would, you know? Yeah, no, her and James got walked in there and you know, I was pretty scared, but I wanted to follow Dorsey and see where he went next. You know?
2477.42 2488.38 speaker3  He followed him instead of calling in to the police.
2487.38 2494.06 speaker1  crazy situation.
2493.06 2495.06 speaker3  that call, man.
2494.06 2510.14 speaker2  I'm sorry.
2506.42 2522.90 speaker3  but John Lee Pettymore has definitely seen it that way.
2519.86 2551.94 speaker1  That's certainly not what I expected to be the next course of action. But you saw a person held at gunpoint. I was scared. I didn't recognize him, but was he, was he fat?
2546.78 2556.14 speaker3  Did we ever send, did we ever get any like of the dental record stuff figured out? Did we send that off?
2553.10 2573.48 speaker0  That was, I think our third thing we were going to try and that's what I was just thinking. Okay. Do you remember the name of that blog or the address for it?
2569.70 2609.08 speaker1  I think it's called, uh, what's behind Dorsey BAM.
2607.58 2614.98 speaker2  I had to go help close.
2613.98 2628.42 speaker0  How long they were in there?
2626.54 2646.34 speaker1  So I figured he was going to stick around. I don't know. It was around 1am maybe. I don't know.
2644.02 2660.06 speaker0  Yeah, no joke. That's why he's having trouble placing it.
2659.06 2673.90 speaker3  Thank you.
2672.90 2677.66 speaker1  Well they were in her.
2676.38 2682.82 speaker2  Is that what you said? Yeah.
2679.66 2689.50 speaker0  This is Joe asking you guys, is there a better question we can ask to get more information about the gunman? I don't know.
2687.90 2701.74 speaker3  was he was fat and dead.
2700.74 2702.74 speaker1  Right?
2701.74 2703.74 speaker3  You, you have no idea.
2702.74 2708.38 speaker1  I mean, he was missing a foot. His foot was missing.
2704.74 2709.38 speaker3  Her foot was missing and there are two feet in the, yeah, so I figured we can't jump to
2708.38 2713.22 speaker1  any conclusions. It's a good pun.
2712.22 2737.82 speaker3  Two people can't. His whole face was missing. His whole face was scarred up.
