Eula writes, please give this message to Klara and Robin, who hate things like this. Without you, the world turns black and white, because your eyes take the color with them when you leave. Happy birthday. Look at me keeping a secret, and give a kiss to Luisa, who is responsible for all three of us listening to this show. I hope I'm making tea for you right now. As we say in Germany, br√ºder muss los. Thank you, Eula. This writing you wrote makes me feel happy, for the people in your life. It's great. But, um, can't help but notice you didn't really say anything about me, Wolf, the dog,
169.88 202.80 speaker0  It doesn't bother me one bit. fan mail where my name is not uttered in a singular instance.

It came off of 30 seconds of deeply serious room noise where you guys are like, we need 30 seconds of silence for, and I thought you were about to say the name of a departed friend into that lovely intro was so wonderful and welcoming.
350.26 365.26 speaker3  Thank you so much for being here. Why are you on our show? Yeah. Are you laughing with us or at us?
362.94 380.66 speaker2  I'm so sorry, but I did. I did agree to come on the show because I thought that you were a friend of my friend
379.66 381.66 speaker3  You're so lucky.
380.66 389.58 speaker2  I know. I feel lucky.
386.98 402.82 speaker3  That's kind of rare in the role playing podcast world.
397.78 403.82 speaker2  I was like, Travis, I'm going on your friend's podcast, and he's like, what, I've never heard
402.82 410.06 speaker3  of that. He's like, who the fuck is that? Zach has a good friend named Travis. I do. There's more overlap.
409.06 412.06 speaker2  They must pretend. Yeah.
411.06 420.78 speaker3  That's exactly what we do. Zach, you never asked Luke how he felt. Luke, are your socks wet?
418.18 423.78 speaker4  How do you feel about having Beth on the show? Neutral plus, I would say.
422.78 426.54 speaker2  Okay.
425.54 427.54 speaker3  I'm sorry.
426.54 428.54 speaker2  He doesn't really know.
427.54 432.98 speaker3  No, I totally understand.
431.98 446.54 speaker4  Yeah. I was like, wait.
445.54 454.54 speaker2  It's chill. I don't know why you're saying really good. I'm like notoriously the worst D&D role player actually ever. I can't believe you guys wanted me on here.
453.54 457.54 speaker3  No, no, no. We don't. That works out really well.
456.54 461.54 speaker4  We don't play D&D. We don't play D&D at all.
460.54 463.22 speaker3  That's fabulous.
461.54 470.78 speaker4  It's like Whose Line, Delta Green.

480.78 483.78 speaker2  He is tall for some people.
482.78 500.02 speaker3  That's true. Zach, what do we do today? Thanks, Joe. I appreciate you asking that. Wait, wait, Zach. What are we doing today? Oh, yeah.

537.18 616.74 speaker3  Sale. First, you must sail to an unnamed island northeast of the Antaeus Maoris in the North Atlantic Ocean. You will then compete with five other seafaring crews in a bizarre interview of sorts for the chance to win a job that claims to pay enough gold to comfortably live off for the Thank you for coming on the boat today. just changed. At the last meeting, it's called the Death of a Salesman. version of Caribs, and welcome to PTBP, Caribs. This is the Death of a Salesman. We're going to show you around who would be on the main deck right off the bat. Wavy Adler. It's Waverly Adler. He goes by Wavy. Is the camera crew now pointed at me? The camera crew is directly pointed at you and Jorgen is just kind of like showing you
612.64 627.32 speaker4  He has a spyglass ad and he's looking out to the horizon and he notices that he's now the center of some attention. Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.
626.32 679.64 speaker3  Can I help you with something? Oh, yes. No, I was just showing people around the ship. Oh, we got a bit of a change here. Yeah, I was just showing people around the Death of a Salesman and I was hoping that you could just tell them what you do around here. Oh, here. Sure, of course. And he kind of straightens out his jacket that's kind of tattered. through his hair real quick. Well, here is the main deck. That's the steering wheel over there and I kind of stand here and look out the edge there and make sure we don't hit anything. And then people come up to me and they ask me questions about things and I try and set them on the right direction. It's usually the direction the wind blows. you comes.
676.50 692.64 speaker4  good for you, you call me Mr. Spitz.
691.64 709.24 speaker3  Oh, Mr. Spitz. I've always been Irish ever since the beginning. that you'll tell people what you do on the ship.
708.24 760.12 speaker4  his ship. I'll make sure this gross tub has an Irish civility. And Geneva had that before Edward Spitz was on board. Never. Mr. Spitz brought you three tines.
756.72 792.84 speaker3  she, what she must do now. Hi, doctor.
785.20 816.40 speaker4  flies open and alabaster, Chernabog projectile vomits, and you see this pale skinned, like long greasy, dark hair, open sores all over his face. Um, his shirt is white and it's just blood and pus. Just soaked.
811.96 833.12 speaker3  And uh, and we get a good description of what her character looks like.
825.56 844.40 speaker2  Um, and um, but like in like more twenties garb, I know that we're supposed to be in like the 1800s or whatever.
843.40 853.44 speaker3  suit.
852.44 875.20 speaker2  peg legs. No, no, no biological legs there. It makes a real like sexy sound, which you wouldn't think, right?
874.20 896.64 speaker3  It's a real jazzy clunk. perfect way. Until I finally get poley erect based on your wood.
895.64 913.24 speaker4  Yeah. He's like, that's not quite my speed.
907.12 926.80 speaker2  And then, uh, Dr. Shark is accompanied always, uh, his permanent, his permanent companion,
922.04 938.52 speaker3  I'm going to use that exact audio for all birds in season two. There you go. This will be a bird-centric season.
937.52 942.04 speaker4  So what is it?
940.04 963.84 speaker3  Like what do we learn from his face? with a, with a heave and a, in a wet, wet mouth.
958.28 973.68 speaker2  I think he says something like, Al, I said, if it is anybody's sick, that is anybody,
972.36 976.76 speaker4  many times before.
973.68 997.16 speaker2  I mean, I could pop up the hood and give it a look. You know what I mean?
996.16 1051.20 speaker3  Oh my gosh. As, as the, uh, as the whole classic interaction between Dr. Shark and alabaster Al, uh, is going down like it does every Tuesday. You're going to stick Jim's the fuck out of the camera with his brown chin length hair Thank you. Modern cannabis for Jurgen stick. He's whimsically joyous when he shouldn't be. I think that, uh, that, that about does it for the shift, doesn't it? Uh, did we meet everyone and you see an entire like massive crew of pirates? Yeah. We probably met everyone.
1050.20 1055.20 speaker4  Right. He met everybody who matters. That's certain.
1054.20 1060.32 speaker3  Patron's name?
1057.20 1106.36 speaker4  Uh, my mom lives in Western Colorado, so next time I'm out in junction, if you want to smoke me up, that would be rad. There's one last person that we need to meet. That makes sense. cleaned up. And yeah, up to this point, alabaster was only just given like sad nods and he wants more sad nods at you while he watches his monkey clean his mess up.
1103.64 1116.44 speaker3  And uh, does anyone have an extra writing utensil?
1115.44 1121.00 speaker4  That's a little pro tip.
1117.44 1124.00 speaker2  A pen is a great tool for anyone in your life. And really anyone.
1123.00 1129.00 speaker3  Wait. Thomas, what's your name?
1128.00 1132.28 speaker4  Thank you, Beth May.
1130.00 1141.88 speaker3  Joe, what's your character name? Wavy Adler.
1139.92 1151.24 speaker4  My name is Alabaster.
1148.76 1159.40 speaker2  I love the promise of a premise.
1155.32 1175.44 speaker4  Alabaster has told him multiple times, when you prove yourself, you get a name. And then it takes the name of the first man it kills.
1174.44 1177.44 speaker3  What is it?
1176.44 1188.88 speaker4  Greater Antilles. Mm-hmm. Philly. All right, my bad.
1183.64 1199.00 speaker3  If you sail past the Labia Majora and into the Labia Minora, which basically all I was
1197.20 1204.00 speaker4  Most nights are pretty dark, Zach.
1201.72 1228.24 speaker3  You can't see the hand in front of your face. I can't, I don't know where. I can't see the blood.
1227.24 1229.24 speaker2  I'm going to wait for the morning.
1228.24 1232.24 speaker5  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll bring up some candles.
1231.24 1237.96 speaker2  Oh, okay. All right, yeah. Oh, okay.
1236.96 1247.96 speaker4  Modern wonders.
1242.44 1269.12 speaker3  small cabin and he's just bleeding profusely from his kneecap. There's a bone sticking up out of his knee as the candle finally makes its way up above
1266.36 1278.08 speaker2  What do you think we should do, Mrs. Knife?
1276.08 1286.08 speaker5  Mrs. Knife never lies.
1282.08 1330.64 speaker2  And Dr. Shark takes a big, what do they use? Like, saws? No, saws are pretty slow. I'll give you a little cork to chew on. And then yes, I get out the bone saw and should I go for it? Can you roll a surgery? Yeah, I'll roll first aid. Yeah, whatever the roll is.
1328.64 1340.20 speaker3  I had a ton of fun the ones I played it. Oh, shit.
1338.20 1342.20 speaker2  I didn't.
1340.20 1348.20 speaker3  You can just subscribe for a month and download it all. No, I don't have a lot of money, Zach.
1346.20 1352.20 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1350.20 1366.76 speaker4  I was going to say, you're a shit salesman. Like, you don't have to. When people are like, sorry, I don't subscribe to the Patreon,
1362.76 1372.76 speaker2  Okay, so do you roll like D20s in this or what?
1370.76 1376.76 speaker3  Yeah, so are you using a mechanical dice roller?
1374.76 1381.76 speaker2  Just roll dice.
1379.76 1390.76 speaker3  I don't know what that is, but it sounds cool. I want one of those, man.
1387.76 1399.32 speaker4  is they get a really nice clacky mechanical dice roller.
1397.32 1403.32 speaker2  My skill in first aid is 90. Oh.
1401.32 1411.32 speaker3  Then you're probably going to roll under it, We're not playing Call of Cthulhu.
1409.32 1415.32 speaker4  We're doing our standard role play game.
1413.32 1455.44 speaker3  We're out of left field here. We're just rolling under to succeed. Crunch as a bone just snaps and literally one of the nerves is like hanging out on the end and it's just wiggling back and forth and when I was bad. My leg cut off and now it's just... His eyes roll back into the back of his head and you look down at a bloody stump that you've created and you know
1453.44 1471.44 speaker2  good work, Mrs. I mean, good work, Mrs. Knife let's tie a tourniquet on you. And then I tie a tourniquet on the leg. And then I'm like, you're gonna be fitted for a wooden leg.
1469.44 1494.00 speaker3  As he just lays back, tongue hanging out eyes rolled in the back of his head you can sense just sort of a pride of Dr. Shark and of the ship in general from everyone in the room including Jurgen Stick who's passed out which is fun for everyone. I love that. Because somebody's leg got chopped off.
1492.00 1500.00 speaker4  crazy mobster clothes in the 1700s.
1498.00 1506.00 speaker2  the tourniquet. It was really nice.
1504.00 1516.00 speaker4  is the coolest person in the world. And desperately wants two peg legs. How many peg legs have you added to the crew
1514.00 1528.00 speaker2  I'll see. Let's check the chart. Right next to the map looks like 72 peg legs. Weird because we only got like 14 crew members.
1526.00 1534.00 speaker4  as well. And I hold up my very shitty metal prosthetic hand.
1532.00 1544.56 speaker5  And some people get addicted
1542.56 1554.56 speaker3  you wouldn't have to have a nice boat because you could fit in all the small cabins if your peg legs were shorter.
1552.56 1556.56 speaker5  We're going to have to think about that one
1554.56 1573.12 speaker4  visually, but also really, you're not thinking of the possibility of just intimidating enemy crews by having everybody river dance. on the fucking
1571.12 1591.12 speaker3  you guys everyone wakes up the next morning to the sound of someone having a lovely time pleasurable experience
1589.12 1601.68 speaker2  just doing pegging
1599.68 1632.24 speaker3  to this lovely exclamation of joy you realize that it is probably Wavy Adler who has noticed that in the distance is a beautiful beautiful island Land ho! With smoke rising out from the middle of it there are four other ships that are parked what do ships do? They park or dock
1630.24 1638.24 speaker2  they all have backup cameras
1636.24 1642.24 speaker5  Dude, I don't know
1640.24 1652.80 speaker4  and I'm like how did I not run over children repeatedly before a backup camera
1650.80 1693.36 speaker3  so there are four other ships their flags flying high in the air as well as their little friend boats hanging out on the shore tenders their chicken tendies are hanging out on the shore there's four of those little man boats what are they called? tendies? so the tendies are already hanging out so you guys are the fifth to arrive that's pretty much all you can see right now unless you want to give me the old spot Hayden or
1691.36 1697.36 speaker4  so my talent is that I can roll a bonus dice
1695.36 1703.36 speaker3  yeah, in case you match your dice and get a crit I got a 19 on a 25
1701.36 1718.32 speaker2  but my talent is I can roll a bonus dice
1716.32 1728.32 speaker4  I just get to decide I also succeeded on the spot, Hayden
1726.32 1794.32 speaker3  I'm going to give you a full run down so what we've got here is we've got four other ships I'll describe their flags to give you an idea of who these pirates are one of the flags has a cannon that is wearing a powdered wig one of the ships has the exact military flag from Great Britain the ol' chestnut, what do they call it? the Union Jack that guy he's got a bottle over the middle of it they've embroidered a big bottle of rum over the middle of the Union Jack a skeleton with horns and then a beard that is not on the face so much, it's just around the neck area of the skeleton and then the last one is two music notes not sure when those were invented quite a while
1792.32 1798.32 speaker5  but
1796.32 1852.32 speaker3  like swinging off of one ship the notes are flinging themselves away from the ship that is on the flag as well, on the shore you see a massive statue, you're not sure yet until you get there what the statue is of, but as islands ought to have, there's a large humanoid statue right on the shore as well as some other just like piles of seemingly ash that's pretty much all you can see from here and we're gonna get you guys on one of those tendies and head into the shore I would assume Jurgen is getting over having a quarter of the legs that he had before about a quarter down Dr. Shark as they make their way onto the deck
1850.32 1862.32 speaker5  I'm a doctor, sorry I was gonna say
1860.32 1870.32 speaker3  is above another or what have you, but I'm alive today and that's likely I made it through the night
1868.32 1878.32 speaker2  just don't mention this to anybody
1876.32 1888.32 speaker3  to cover the peg getting the crew ready to
1886.32 1892.32 speaker4  yeah I mean you're good at like navigation and stuff so you would probably be
1890.32 1904.32 speaker5  commanding the tender a 3 for my navigation skill which means we get there so
1902.32 1920.32 speaker4  in the boat on the way there Alvester looks at Dr. Shark and he pulls his shirt up and there's just like another sore on his body but there's also like hundreds of sores
1918.32 1928.32 speaker2  hey Mrs. Knife check out this sore
1926.32 1934.32 speaker4  happy, he feels like yeah it is a good one and then he just puts his shirt back down and like stares off
1932.32 1940.32 speaker5  into the distance, yeah it's an impressive sore laughter
1938.32 1950.32 speaker4  about halfway there Al wants to swim because the salt water really helps his
1948.32 1960.32 speaker2  drag behind the boat to get him to talk so I mean as long as you don't say anything we could drag you behind the boat see how your sores like it or whatever
1958.32 1990.32 speaker4  Al takes the doctor's advice to heart and he uses what is it, rope use skill to tie himself behind the boat, very well done, I don't think time back there, like an inner
1988.32 1998.32 speaker3  he is the wakeboard, what's Mr. Smiths doing Spitz, Spitz, Smiths
1996.32 2008.32 speaker4  Mr. Spitz is eyeing the island with incredible suspicion, but he also has a moment to praise the navigation of Wavy Adler
2006.32 2012.32 speaker5  is I always thought being on a sheer glass when you had
2010.32 2026.32 speaker4  a window with Mr. Adler listening, he like one eye is so incredibly squinted at the island and
2024.32 2030.32 speaker5  the other eye is so big at you?
2028.32 2044.32 speaker4  both dead on at the island but he is just assessing
2042.32 2054.32 speaker3  as you come upon the island also I have a monkey on my chest
2052.32 2064.32 speaker5  let's not 10 feet behind is
2062.32 2090.32 speaker4  you're in the salt water with your open sores and your screams but my monkey is there to give me comfort Jesus now, Jesus the monkey
2088.32 2094.32 speaker2  yeah, love that
2092.32 2140.32 speaker3  you notice that the statue actually has a lot of alligator facial features that are alligator-ish it's got a alligator face it's a human body with an alligator head oh you're not sure, the gator tail might be buried, however the long snoot of the gator seems to make a bit of a platform that you could walk out on and as you you see that there's actually a ladder up the back that is kind of like scales, but it's a ladder that you can climb up about 13, 5 meters, I don't know 15 feet up to the 13, 5 meters? 13.5
2138.32 2150.32 speaker2  I'm a doctor, not an expert on the metric system
2148.32 2160.32 speaker3  hit the beach, and as you just slow-mo
2158.32 2174.32 speaker4  flowing in the wind a splashylvania towel from season 1 splashylvania, you'll want to soak your buds
2172.32 2176.32 speaker3  pod dot shop, please buy a
2174.32 2182.32 speaker4  bath towel from us for $40
2180.32 2194.32 speaker5  are those real?
2192.32 2204.32 speaker3  I want to soak your buds it's a vampire themed abandoned water park from season 1
2202.32 2212.32 speaker4  the ladder are all these other pirate crews that we've now joined, are they all being
2210.32 2244.32 speaker3  you see that the other four wait, the tendies hit the beach the other four tendies are empty mad empty, and there's no one on this beach that you you notice that there seems to be like a ditch or a channel dug into the sand parallel to the water for as far as you can see, and it's got a red
2242.32 2254.32 speaker2  not that I would do anything I don't see a person here to fix or whatever should I roll to see if it's blood
2252.32 2266.32 speaker3  you get down, you stick your whole head in it no, so it's definitely blood you can smell the iron as you approach the long channel, it's about six inches
2264.32 2282.32 speaker2  blood, I can smell the iron in it it's about six inches wide
2280.32 2294.32 speaker4  Spitz is taking just a huge fingerful and tasting it a full thirty seconds after it's been announced
2292.32 2306.32 speaker3  it's kind of a filmy layer on top when you dig your finger in you would have a film on your finger as you lift up
2304.32 2322.32 speaker2  that was a little joke about the film part
2320.32 2326.32 speaker4  I want to send my monkey out to scout
2324.32 2334.32 speaker5  awesome
2332.32 2338.32 speaker3  monkey work, dude?
2336.32 2342.32 speaker4  a pass
2340.32 2392.32 speaker3  ok, sick, I'll see what I can do alright, so oh, better than I did sand is like flying up behind the monkey's paws and feet as it clambers about toward the tree line that is on the opposite side from the water on its hands, because it's a monkey and it turns around it turns around by putting its head in between its legs and looking back at you oh, it's a funny monkey oh, it's a hilarious monkey which you know to mean there's somebody watching us
2390.32 2398.32 speaker2  oh, so we watch them back
2396.32 2414.32 speaker5  efficient flourish pulls it up to his eye and he wants to spot hidden right where the monkey was indicating awesome, yeah, go ahead and roll with
2412.32 2436.32 speaker3  alright, so with the success there, you notice that there is a tall, bald overweight man who is not paying attention to you but he is just kind of like standing and surveying the beach, he seems to think that he is being sneaky but he is not?
2434.32 2440.32 speaker5  he ain't hiding too well
2438.32 2448.32 speaker2  being sneaky, but you're not being very sneaky
2446.32 2452.32 speaker4  we've been playing the forest
2450.32 2458.32 speaker3  so as you run, you'd have to jump over this little channel of blood, yeah? I step right in it
2456.32 2468.32 speaker4  step right in it my body, so, you know
2466.32 2470.32 speaker5  it just gets right in there
2468.32 2498.32 speaker4  so yeah, it like helps it's blood maybe like 6 now also it's old times, but before germs leg the bald guy I yell, I see that he isn't noticing me and I yell at him because I don't want to like tackle him, but I'm, that's what I'm about to do unless he tells me not to his eyes get really big and he just
2496.32 2548.32 speaker3  kind of stares at you with these big eyes no, he doesn't seem to be dressed like a pirate he's just kind of a guy dressed like a dude for like a person of this time this moat and he's like, yeah, these are my moats, so they can't be
2546.32 2554.32 speaker5  hey doc, in your professional opinion is there any reason a man might have a blood trough?
2552.32 2564.32 speaker2  I've seen like a few blood troughs but never any that people willingly and a lively captive
2562.32 2588.32 speaker3  no, we've got good reasons, but that's not you're not here for reasons, you're here to do the ship race that you guys are in to fix where Alabaster Al had stepped on this blood trough and he's just kind of making it the exact same width as everything else
2586.32 2592.32 speaker5  Mitch, is this the blood of the other crews
2590.32 2600.32 speaker3  no, they're waiting we're all waiting for you guys and one other crew
2598.32 2606.32 speaker4  and I dip my knife into the blood so that I have the blood curse knife
2604.32 2640.32 speaker3  you can have a blood curse knife, that's okay I don't think that'll help well anyway just kind of like water courses, whatever for Mitch Diggory by the way, Diggory's my last name I'm Mitch Diggory, it's nice to meet you guys I love being useful so I'd just really like to help direct you to the way to go
2638.32 2664.32 speaker4  is his character description that he's helpful? of canals of blood to dig it kind of worked out perfect and a huge backlog of NPC names that we need to get rid of
2662.32 2670.32 speaker3  and so he starts walking away from his ditch and his gutter and his trench
2668.32 2674.32 speaker2  like this is the way, the money, right?
2672.32 2688.32 speaker3  win the opportunity to make a bunch of money so you never have to pirate again or whatever oh, is that where you guys have been calling him?
2686.32 2694.32 speaker5  cash on, I think Wavy is with me but I don't know if most of the crew
2692.32 2698.32 speaker4  the Olympics has a significant supporter
2696.32 2706.32 speaker5  a lot of people are just calling it the Crucible yeah, I never read it
2704.32 2714.32 speaker2  it the big thing, like we getting ready for the big thing
2712.32 2726.32 speaker5  talking, Dottoshock, you sound like pretty wild stuff
2724.32 2750.32 speaker4  multiple HR meetings about the other international people on board yeah
2748.32 2810.32 speaker3  Beth, I need you to choose between those flags that we saw earlier do you remember any of the so as you guys are heading further into the jungle of this island you're going through there's a path that's already kind of been created that Mitch is sort of leading you down and as you guys are going you really can't see too far ahead of you because the thick is he's kind of moving you through this sort of channel of a pathway as the jungle kind of creeps around your head almost and creates a cave that you're kind of walking through almost and then all of a sudden you hear else's fault
2808.32 2816.32 speaker5  else's fault
2814.32 2854.32 speaker3  and you guys hit a clearing and you see ahead of you there is a slight fork in the road and this other pirate crew has clearly gone the wrong way and the captain he's wearing the hat and everything and boy does this guy have a beard but it is not on his jawline at all or above his lip it is just pure jaw down and it connects into his hamburger meat which is reaching up oh I hate that term
2852.32 2862.32 speaker5  ludicrous calls his chest hair hamburger meat and Zach threw that out casually one night and everybody says
2860.32 2866.32 speaker2  I respect it though, so there
2864.32 2880.32 speaker3  and so like I said his hamburger meat is just climbing up to meet the surly, surly hairs that have made their way down from the chin toward the nape the nape and neck the nape and nape
2878.32 2884.32 speaker5  the lips, the teeth
2882.32 2912.32 speaker3  drowning in some sort of quicksand and he is I'm gonna go ahead and roll real quick he is he is up to his thighs already and he is waggling so hard he is not being calm he is just like
2910.32 2918.32 speaker5  oh my god Neckbeard what are you doing here?
2916.32 2934.32 speaker3  and the crew is all like standing around and pointing at him and talking amongst themselves you'd have to get something long like how long? to kind of reach out maybe like five, six feet long
2932.32 2940.32 speaker4  to be able to pull him out
2938.32 2951.32 speaker2  I know one way to handle this Mrs. Knife
2950.32 2953.32 speaker3  there's got to be another way
2952.32 2955.32 speaker5  he's a doctor
2954.32 2961.32 speaker3  what are you gonna take me out the hip? yeah, we might as well
2959.32 2969.32 speaker5  and I never met a doctor as shrewd as Dr. Shark if he says your legs gotta go they gotta go
2967.32 2981.32 speaker4  to sit down so we can get over there you're like Australian now
2980.32 2988.32 speaker5  happy birthday
2986.32 2996.32 speaker4  noice, noice, no no I won't do it he, as you guys are
2994.32 3001.32 speaker3  he has sunk he's sunk hip to nip at this point damn I'm sorry Nepo
3000.32 3005.32 speaker5  you're so hip to nip there's no hope for you
3004.32 3009.32 speaker3  flailing about and he's like seriously
3008.32 3013.32 speaker5  throw me a rope fuck
3011.32 3016.32 speaker2  so I'm out of ideas
3014.32 3019.32 speaker5  okay you just save the head doctor
3018.32 3032.32 speaker6  what about the neck I mean we should ask the doctor does he need his neck for his bed
3031.32 3036.32 speaker2  umm there
3035.32 3048.32 speaker5  there yeah I mean most people but
3047.32 3051.32 speaker3  he rolled a one this time so now he's nips to pits damn
3050.32 3056.32 speaker2  wait
3054.32 3064.32 speaker4  now he's gone from his nips to his pits I get you a one is a nip to pits
3062.32 3068.32 speaker2  so you're getting really dire
3067.32 3077.32 speaker4  well next is his dimps that's my secret the dimps and then the temps and then the temps and then your kaput okay then he's fine
3076.32 3078.32 speaker2  he's got plenty of time
3077.32 3087.32 speaker4  yeah then he's limps can I like look on his crew to see if any of them happen to be wearing a rope as a belt
3086.32 3088.32 speaker5  on what?
3087.32 3098.32 speaker4  rope use rope use fuck still no I failed none of them are wearing belts
3097.32 3109.32 speaker3  which is why they're not helping no he failed his rope use roll so he can't identify the belts
3108.32 3127.32 speaker5  because it's what's happening
3122.32 3133.32 speaker2  yeah I mean the neck you need sometimes but uh not tonight not tonight
3131.32 3150.32 speaker6  certified somewhere
3144.32 3160.32 speaker2  to see if I can like chop off his head and get back before I start to sink
3157.32 3184.32 speaker3  so you just have to pass a marbles check so I want you to roll your marbles and see if you can hold on to your marbles power power power
3182.32 3202.32 speaker2  under sizzler oh no it was 80

3213.32 3264.32 speaker3  by how quickly your hand disappears into this quicksand and honestly your gut reaction is to hold still but there's nothing inside Dr. Shark that can hold still right now as you lose your marbles and then the weight of your just moving forward pushes your face directly as you're like ew oh my god ew and now we just see let me roll a d4 that's a four yeah so you are head shoulders
