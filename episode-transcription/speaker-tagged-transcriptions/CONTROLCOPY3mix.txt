0.00 13.34 speaker0  Welcome, my children, to the family reunion that is PTBP.
9.14 121.34 speaker1  while feeding you some room temp potato salad. you're making it wrong. I'm feeding you live from 694.2. I don't know, man, I ain't looked outside in a minute. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Rob in Atlanta. Rob writes, "'Mornin', Wolf, big fan Rob callin' in from the city. "'In my last year of law school, I gotta tell you, "'it's wild how often local officers "'ignore all kinds of laws. "'rather than scientific method. "'who told me about y'all in the first place. "'It goes Shaka, Mr. T, Felicia, all over the sea, yeah. "'Well, hello, big fan Rob from the city. "'I have no idea what this song is you speak of, "'and I know so many songs. "'I have played so many different tracks, "'I can hardly keep track of them all. "'If you wanna write up somethin' for your Aunt Wolf to Hal, "'please submit your memorandum "'as a five-star review on Apple Podcasts, "'and I'll read it here on 694.2 PTBP,
117.26 129.84 speaker0  "'and sweatiest radio station.
125.92 137.36 speaker1  "'Doctor, doctor, give me the news.
132.86 145.14 speaker0  "'against Arvin Chilton that just don't add up to this Wolf.
141.26 233.06 speaker1  "'who was brutally chopped to pieces on March 21st, "'was seen by multiple witnesses at a gas station "'in Upstate New York two days later on March 23rd. "'And later that same day at that same Shell gas station, "'the clerk, a 59-year-old man named Quentin Harris, "'and very clearly by Arvin Chilton. "'During the savage murder, a car pulled in to refuel "'Quentin Harris, within five feet of him, "'despite looking around several times, "'and drove off as if nothing was amiss. "'I tell you what, Wolf here might have just done "'the same thing to avoid having to talk to the cops, "'but damn, it ain't right. "'However, it's okay to be wrong every now and then, "'proving my point with his pleasing pipes. "'It's Brian Bulger with Bad in a Good Way.'"
230.90 287.36 speaker0  ["Bad in a Good Way"] Feels like I'm on the last bend of the deep end, but the drowning's been just fine. And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind, I'll be all right, I can go there, Hey, hey! Bing bong, roly jays, do bing bong, roly jays. Hey, hey!
282.36 289.48 speaker2  Everybody now, bing bong, roly jays, bing bong, roly jays.
287.48 294.08 speaker0  So do you guys remember back in,
291.52 302.96 speaker2  There was a few years ago where suddenly everyone that Taylor and I knew from college, Taylor being my wife, for those of you who are new to listening,
301.04 312.94 speaker0  in certain parts of the podcast Was that a reference to season one? You said no references.
310.90 503.24 speaker2  Ah, no references to season one. we're 29 now, when we were probably 25, and I was supposed to dress for weddings, and I didn't have any fucking money at all, and so I was like, basically what would happen is I didn't have clothes to wear to a wedding, so every single time I got invited to a wedding, I would go to Kohl's, because Kohl's has an insane return policy, a very, very good lax return policy, or a nice suit coat or whatever I needed to go to this wedding. I actually, I said tie, but I never wear ties, but I remember specifically for this story, a nice discount suit jacket that looked nice on me, and then I wore it to this wedding, and this wedding was actually really fun, but it was one of Taylor's friends from a long time, family, friends from an early age. Zach, I just wanna get one thing clear real quick. Yeah, hit me with it. You lied about the tie. How much of the rest of this is a lie? Oh, all of it. and I didn't know anyone there, and Taylor was in this group of four girls. She was one of the bridesmaids, And did the photo booth by myself. Well, it. So there was a photo booth there that would take four pictures of you and then spit out a little image there like you might in a photo booth, and there were lots of little props there, so I put on four different hats and just stared ominously directly into the camera with the saddest face that I could muster, and so I had this amazing group of four pictures of me in this looking fresh in this Kohl's suit, and I took these pictures, and I was like, man, I am gonna love these pictures forever, and I stuck them in the inside pocket of my suit jacket, and then I returned that jacket to Kohl's, and as soon as I walked out the door, I thought, oh no, there is a picture of me inside of the pocket of that jacket and not only is it just a weird set of four pictures of a guy by himself looking sad as possible, he's wearing that suit jacket. they would be like, oh, well, I see. I see. He did not enjoy the jacket. This jacket would only bring forth negative memories
501.64 507.48 speaker0  just like throw it back on the rack,
505.52 508.32 speaker2  Yeah, straight up.
507.48 513.00 speaker0  Maybe not.
511.36 538.92 speaker2  is coming with stock photos. This kid looks poor. They would have said, based on how scraggly my beard probably was. Yep. You were a great big fat person back then, right?
538.08 541.28 speaker0  Nope, nope.
539.76 545.76 speaker2  I am not editing that out. No, do take out the body shaming.
542.48 550.80 speaker0  That's just because we watched Silence of the Lambs.
548.80 632.20 speaker2  I know, and you were a great big fat person. and I quit drinking Tom Collins' every night, which at the time, for some reason, my mind was like, I don't understand how every night when I drink three pint-sized gin and tonics with extra syrupy lime juice poured on top of it, So much sugar. The calories in a drink will get to you, folks. Yeah, but the calories in a drink that's also filled with syrupy sugar is also no bueno. I was literally putting simple syrup and sugary lime juice because at the time, I didn't know that tonic water Like as much as a soda. That's why it's good. It's honest, you know? It's fermented. You can count a whole lot of them. If you're practicing this well.
629.78 639.28 speaker0  which means I'm just drinking beer these days. Holy shit.
635.52 646.48 speaker2  there was this guy like peed himself before a meeting and they're like, you gotta go to rehab.
645.52 649.24 speaker0  so he's doing good.
648.40 654.72 speaker2  That actor. Isn't that Brian Doyle Murphy? Yeah, he was in God Bless America. Brian Doyle Murray.
652.44 659.22 speaker0  And that movie fucking rules. Yeah, it does. It really does. Right, it does rule.
658.38 662.56 speaker2  It's fucked up. You know what? I haven't seen it in a long time. You're right, it might suck.
661.72 674.88 speaker0  I don't know, it might suck. I only recognize that guy from Shameless. He played like a cuck. It's Bill Murray's brother.
672.52 686.48 speaker2  Yeah, guys, he's pretty famous. I don't think it is. If you're thinking of the guy who pisses pants in Mad Men, that is.
684.48 688.14 speaker0  That's not Brian Doyle Murray, is it? Yeah, it is.
687.32 697.54 speaker2  Yeah, it totally is. Hold on. What's his character's name in that?
696.70 698.36 speaker0  The guy you're thinking of?
697.54 707.32 speaker2  So that's what I was gonna say. It's his other brother. Look up Bill Murray's brothers. Other brother. Yeah. Butter, butter.
706.48 712.36 speaker0  Dude, nutter butter.
711.52 714.28 speaker2  Joel Murray.
712.36 726.36 speaker0  Hold on, I'm talking about nutter butter. Oh shit, I thought Joel Murray was Brian Doyle Murray.
722.52 744.52 speaker2  Yeah, Joel is in Mad Men, and God bless America. God bless America. What were you saying, though? It's the sugar crystals on the outside
742.92 762.98 speaker0  than listening to a podcast, and you know that the hosts are incorrect.
760.20 775.70 speaker2  because we are dealing with some very unsettling situations here. Nutter butters. Wafer things? Oh, I know exactly. Oh.
774.86 785.04 speaker0  What are those called? I like those more than nutter butters, but I do like nutter butters.
784.22 800.70 speaker2  No. Wafers. What the fuck? Or nutty bars. Yeah, nutty buddies. Yes, they are, and there's no chocolate.
798.20 804.40 speaker0  And a fluffer nutter is marshmallow
802.10 807.88 speaker2  Is that exactly what Elvis ate?
807.04 811.08 speaker0  and bananas.
810.24 811.90 speaker2  And honey.
811.08 817.28 speaker0  And chocolate.
816.44 842.04 speaker2  Thank you. It's not been one week for us, but it has been one week for the listener. So let's give them a nice little recap
839.52 855.56 speaker0  We got freaking, what's his first name? Arvin Chilton. We got an ex-Delta Green agent slicing up eyeballs.
854.72 887.32 speaker2  Slicing up eyeballs? No, I don't know it. Look, do you know it? Cool, yeah. I read Fight Club. I get it.
886.48 915.10 speaker0  Yeah. Things are bad in Ocean City, New Jersey. We got an ex-Delta Green agent who's killing people close to him in his life. Slicing up eyeballs. who pointed us toward his domicile, and we went and talked to the landlord there. and then I think it was him who recommended we go over to a cafe and have a little lunch.
913.30 918.62 speaker2  That was actually Mara Kinlan. Oh, that's right.
915.94 922.34 speaker0  We went back and talked to the NYPD who had been on this. Newark.
921.50 971.14 speaker2  Newark, yeah. on the fact that Eileen McCarty, he had this idea that Eileen McCarty was not the body that was found in her own home because she was seen by witnesses in two locations. But she was like, it's definitely her. when she was looking over the actual high-res like digital files from crime scene photos, came to the same conclusion because Garza, Uncle Jimmy with the FBI, was using these like printed out- Mayonnaise covered. Mayonnaise covered crime scene photos. Yeah, he was gross. He was gross. Yeah, Agent Garza was pretty unprofessional.
968.66 998.30 speaker0  which was above Alexander Duchesne's apartment. Who did that without notes? I did. I don't take notes, folks. And we looked around. He had a bunch of Shakespeare in his duplex. And then we went downstairs and his landlord, who lives below him, had a copy of As I Lay Dying.
996.46 1000.22 speaker2  Mother Faulkner and-
998.30 1013.22 speaker0  He had a copy of That Thing You Do. That's right. Which still existed in 4060.
1009.06 1015.14 speaker2  It was called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
1013.22 1034.30 speaker0  And we all sat down and watched it. Luke, we literally sat down and had it on before this started. What's it called? What's it start with? As I Lay Dying. The book.
1032.74 1041.98 speaker2  That one. I didn't watch it for obvious reasons.
1039.06 1066.62 speaker0  James Franco in the band As I Lay Dying. As you imagined it. I did look right at the title when we turned it on.
1064.22 1073.90 speaker2  I know, and it's also a really famous Shakespeare play
1073.06 1076.10 speaker0  I don't know what it is.
1075.26 1087.46 speaker2  As You Like It.
1086.62 1117.62 speaker0  I knew it was ads. He had the ads, yeah. Anyway, the landlord had a copy of that, said that it was fitting, and watch the college production of it. He said it was fitting, and we knew that there's disguises involved in that book. And he smelled like bandages. What else did we find out?
1116.08 1129.82 speaker2  Here's what's involved in that play, People pretending to be other people. Which we pointed out. We already did the joke about our game, so we're not gonna do that again.
1128.30 1147.52 speaker0  We've done that. Get over it. But that is,
1145.76 1151.96 speaker2  That's when we went over to the cafe,
1150.72 1161.84 speaker3  You should take a peek at it.
1160.08 1168.72 speaker2  I don't listen to that nerd shit. I don't either.
1166.36 1194.60 speaker0  it as a symbol of the Testament of New Flesh, which is an organization obsessed with magic. They chant in Aklo, a pre-human language. Oh shit, is this gonna be real Cthulhu? Are we gonna meet Cthulhu?
1191.60 1213.32 speaker2  Yeah, we had Cthulhu end one of our campaigns. That's true. Joe's character was on the beach looking out. Yeah, that was pretty rad. As Cthulhu just rose up. off the beach.
1212.04 1216.28 speaker0  The minions from Despicable Me.
1214.52 1217.48 speaker2  Stuart was there.
1216.28 1246.52 speaker0  Kevin, Bob. Yeah, all the classics. I was gonna say, I would rather have run into the Testament of Nude Flesh.
1242.64 1261.56 speaker2  that you guys have made for games that I've run for you, none of you have ever been like, and my character is horny. you can do it out of game. That's my rule.
1260.72 1276.72 speaker0  No. What happened next? And it was Duchenne saying that he had just gotten a phone call that ruined his day. And it was that Arvin had called and said, you're next. So we sped over there.
1275.52 1294.84 speaker2  Oh, I'm gonna kill you. Yeah. Slicing up bibles.
1293.64 1306.32 speaker0  Mickey says eyeballs. And then we found out that he was in Ocean City.
1305.48 1308.76 speaker2  No, we did not.
1306.32 1333.44 speaker0  What we found out is that the phone call keep watch over Duchenne that night. We've got uniform PD. We also had, yeah. When we called Chilton's phone, we heard it vibrating upstairs. And that's where we ended off.
1330.20 1361.96 speaker2  Someone made an intelligence check about As You Like It. I believe it was Agent Sparrow. Which you passed and therefore you were allowed to watch As You Like It today before we came in. Right. Otherwise you wouldn't have let me out of the cage. I would have said, you cannot get out of this cage, Thomas. Does it smell like David still? I got some free time though.
1360.56 1366.12 speaker0  All right, let's dig in.
1365.12 1379.12 speaker2  The three of you are standing in Arvin Chilton's apartment. Say your character's names real quick and your character voices starting with Joe. Now Luke. Now Thomas. Agent Clarissa Sparrow.
1377.96 1386.68 speaker0  We should do that more often.
1383.04 1401.06 speaker2  You're all in Alexander Duchenne's apartment. It is pouring down rain outside. It is now dark. There are four squad cars outside. You know that there are some ocean city. Some ocean.
1400.22 1401.90 speaker0  I've got to take this.
1401.06 1417.04 speaker2  Yeah, of course. There's some ocean shitty police officers outside who had their kick the dog moment when they made fun of Kevin Gelato.
1415.76 1424.56 speaker0  He doesn't forget much. And as the three of you are standing
1420.64 1427.44 speaker2  you've asked him to call back Arvin Chilton.
1426.60 1429.94 speaker3  Brring, brring. Brring, brring. Brring, brring.
1429.10 1430.76 speaker0  Brring, brring.
1429.94 1448.34 speaker3  Brring, brring.
1444.92 1465.92 speaker2  which is the vibrate thin ring, ring tone. So who has the highest dexterity? 60. I got a 70. 60. Joe, you were going to kick off in this-
1463.88 1470.28 speaker0  So the phone rings and we're in combat?
1465.92 1479.00 speaker2  Yeah, Joe is looking at me with like, incredulity.
1478.04 1487.48 speaker0  Sure, you don't have to be. Just because you're acting first Gotcha. I thought that's what you were having us talk about, is marching order kind of thing.
1485.92 1494.18 speaker2  Well, we are talking, we're talking just about action order. So not marching order necessarily,
1491.04 1505.20 speaker0  but we're going to start with what do you do? Make wide eyes at the guys and do the silence over the mouth thing and point up. Awesome.
1504.20 1511.44 speaker2  What are you looking for here?
1510.48 1541.96 speaker0  but I'm not going to do that. No, no, no, no, no. He's too dumb.
1541.12 1547.28 speaker3  Hello?
1546.40 1553.76 speaker2  about doing something, let's just have agent Sparrow is going to go next. Cool.
1551.92 1561.32 speaker0  when she hears the vibrating phone. And then she looks around to see how Duchenne is reacting. He is immediately like,
1560.24 1573.56 speaker2  and he's horrified. And he is like looking for a place to hide. Okay.
1570.48 1583.08 speaker0  Like an ocular pat down and see if this is.
1581.80 1611.72 speaker2  What do you want to roll for that? What do you think? Medicine or? Search, medicine, intelligence, humans. I think you would be able to determine.
1610.28 1617.16 speaker0  Cause I don't get enough sun.
1613.76 1629.64 speaker2  He has the bearing of someone who is in public service who worked for the feds. Like the way that he reacted was something that someone with military experience.
1628.80 1655.68 speaker0  He has the bearing. Like a bear might have. Like a bear has. Thomas is forgetting his background. He was not in any kind of law enforcement or.
1651.52 1669.80 speaker2  is that he supposedly played baseball when he was younger. And you like don't know if that was. I mean, he said he wasn't very good at it, but that's all you really got about him. You don't know a lot about him.
1668.48 1672.48 speaker0  Oh, a hundred percent.
1671.36 1702.88 speaker2  Yeah. That's right. That's because. pulling social security. Right. Not working for Bezos H2O. When you say that, does he look like a 79 year old man who has that background?
1699.56 1712.08 speaker0  or like something controlling his body in an unnatural way?
1709.56 1723.68 speaker2  Yeah, this is just learning something new about Alexander D. Shane. This is just learning something new
1722.84 1724.72 speaker0  Yeah, of course.
1723.68 1731.64 speaker2  Because I have a lot of suspicions about what's going on here. Why wouldn't you?
1728.84 1749.04 speaker0  doesn't know she's in a scenario called control copy. Sure. I don't know why you keep saying that Don't gaslight me.
1746.92 1764.30 speaker2  It's my job to gaslight you. That's what a DM does. Yeah. So without metagaming, what do you do next?
1762.68 1810.50 speaker0  lead me towards a terrible fate. Right, yeah. But I guess that's the game we play, so. It is. She, passing that sanity test, she all of a sudden thinks he might be a little more capable than she estimated. Sure. So she says to the uniformed PD, you stay on him, you protect him. I'm going upstairs. and looks down at his hand. Which is balled up into a fist. Right. but then he sees Sparrow start heading towards the door And he heads up the stairs.
1809.26 1811.86 speaker2  He waits.
1810.50 1818.70 speaker0  Let me in first. He lets her in front of him.
1816.90 1835.78 speaker2  or are you gonna run up them? has the worst stealth of the two? I don't have any. You should roll.
1834.68 1854.34 speaker0  I got a 91. Wha-choo!
1852.80 1860.98 speaker2  And the door is closed. Locked? No, she opens it.
1859.68 1867.12 speaker0  which we watched yesterday, remember at her Quantico training, where she gets capped.
1865.96 1868.44 speaker2  From behind the door, she missed the corner.
1867.12 1875.80 speaker0  She didn't check her corners. She carefully opens the doors, checking her corners. I love trade craft.
1873.16 1894.72 speaker2  Feels so good when it's well used in a game. Man, that's excellent. Okay, so because you checked the corners, you get to see the same thing you would have seen if you hadn't, which is absolutely nothing different in this room except for there is a phone sitting on the kitchen countertop.
1892.94 1902.18 speaker0  Can we clock that it definitely wasn't there the last time we were in the apartment?
1899.78 1906.02 speaker2  Are you now upstairs or are you hanging out downstairs?
1905.18 1923.78 speaker0  Okay, perfect. No, none that you're aware of.
1922.92 1937.30 speaker2  It's my craft. Okay, fantastic. I love a craft. Just four young witches learning how to. There's not any security cameras. Thomas showed me the craft. I'd never seen it until Thomas showed me that movie. A couple of Halloween's ago. No, yeah, I remember it,
1935.86 1960.46 speaker0  but I think that was the first time I watched it too. Oh, nice, it was rad. What's up? called Craft American Singles? The Craft American Singles, but yeah.
1958.78 1966.66 speaker2  Oh yeah, it's paid for already.
1965.10 1977.46 speaker0  What kind of cheese do you like? I only eat craft. I failed, so there's not any security cameras.
1973.74 1983.06 speaker2  No security cameras around to speak of that you know of. Everything seems to be in the exact same place where it was left. No footprints or anything.
1981.22 1985.54 speaker0  Like bloody footprints obviously right there.
1983.06 2024.82 speaker2  No obvious bloody footprints, no. someone has absolutely been in this apartment. You can tell because there's now a phone There's a path of dirt in between the front door and the kitchen where the phone is. This is from.
2022.30 2033.50 speaker0  She leans down and like picks up some of the dirt and rubs it between her fingers and smells it. And this person had stepped in dog shit and she got some dog shit.
2031.34 2042.26 speaker2  But you know that that dog shit was fresh. So like this clearly happened in between the time where you were here earlier and now.
2039.74 2050.08 speaker0  Kevin sees her doing that and is like, oh, that's maybe I should do that too. Maybe I should smell the dog shit. Yeah.
2049.26 2050.92 speaker2  He's like.
2050.08 2053.00 speaker0  No, no, yeah.
2052.16 2053.84 speaker2  No, I hate this.
2053.00 2094.26 speaker0  Yes, keep doing it. He's like, that's definitely dog shit. I've had that before. Sure. But he just nods his head having no idea what she's thinking. She gives him the saddest look. He thinks she's sad because she can't figure out where the dog shit came from. Oh. Four rolls. What's up guys? Zach rolled the dice four times and then didn't say anything. Yep. I want to go in and go to the phone.
2092.16 2095.44 speaker3  I want to grab the phone and I want to look through it.
2094.26 2104.96 speaker0  Is this a studio? Yeah. Okay. We're in the only room.
2104.12 2109.38 speaker2  Nope. Does that dirt trail lead to the closet?
2108.54 2128.88 speaker0  and then back out the door? Yep. Okay. This dirt trail leads out the floor. This dirt trail leads to the door after it leads
2126.32 2131.16 speaker3  It's actually dog shit, not dirt.
2130.32 2134.72 speaker0  I know.
2133.88 2142.98 speaker3  Yeah, I know too. Maybe he has a... Does that... Alvin? What's his fucking name? Arvin. Arvin.
2142.14 2145.64 speaker0  Arvin. But I thought his name was Alvin last episode too.
2144.80 2158.16 speaker3  Arvin! No.
2157.32 2159.24 speaker0  Well, I have.
2158.16 2165.20 speaker3  I was never trying to.
2164.28 2175.76 speaker0  He didn't want to be embarrassed. You don't know. A lot. Some people even say it's good luck.
2174.74 2184.12 speaker3  A lot, I'm lucky.
2182.70 2196.14 speaker0  You did that. So there you go. Once you've stepped in it, probably nothing worse will happen than putting that shit in your mouth.
2195.30 2205.36 speaker2  Good talk. I watched a trailer today. Quick trailer alert. Trailer alert! You guys know how we do trailer alerts? Yeah, classic trailer alert.
2204.08 2213.62 speaker0  Stop trying to make trailer alerts a thing.
2211.32 2236.24 speaker2  with the guy from Crazy Rich Asians and the blonde girl from Game of Thrones. And- They, she, a bird shits in her eye. Nice. And she fucking dies. And he tells her it's good luck. And she's like, what? That's- And he's like, do you want to go out with me? And she's like, no.
2235.20 2240.04 speaker0  Dog shit I get. If a bird shits in your eye-
2237.08 2249.04 speaker2  A bird shit in her eye and they show it in the trailer of like the goop hitting, which now, uh oh, side story. I saw Kings of Leon perform after the-
2248.20 2253.96 speaker0  In a bird shit in your eye? I think you told this on the pod already.
2252.64 2309.40 speaker2  But when I saw Kings of Leon, they played outside in a bird shit in the bassist's mouth. I remember that was in the news which is the first song off Only By The Night. And then they played the next song off Only By The Night, which is Crawl, which is a fucking jam. And then they played Taper Jean Girl, which was fucking rad. And so I heard the only three songs I like by Kings of Leon and during the third one, a bird strip. I watched the shit fall down from the rafters and the bassist looked up at just the wrong time and it landed directly in his mouth. He ripped his bass off of himself and walked off stage. And then they finished the song and left. That's so lame.
2307.88 2325.28 speaker0  went how far down his throat. if a bird shit in your mouth, you fucking wash that shit out. You take a minute. You take a minute and you go to bed.
2322.88 2339.88 speaker2  It was made exponentially better because Justin Bieber broke his leg on stage and finished the show. He's a pop star.
2336.76 2360.20 speaker0  They're like, we're southern whiskey drinking boys. I thought that the deal was that they were vaguely Christian. I wanna pick it up and look through it. Yeah, of course.
2358.32 2376.72 speaker2  that you would recognize from the log that you got from the FBI. there are very few and far between. It seems that Chilton was not much of a texter.
2374.84 2382.92 speaker0  before that phone call that she received a few days before she died?
2381.96 2386.02 speaker3  Is there a role I can do
2384.88 2426.96 speaker2  What do you wanna roll for that? I'll do it too. So, cause you rolled SIGINT and I love that skill and we never use it, if you go through the photos and you start scrolling through, you're gonna realize that each panel of like nine photos, the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right, remind you strangely of like the points of that weird pentagram thing. The flesh pentagram. Yeah, that you saw earlier.
2426.12 2427.80 speaker0  Pfft.
2426.96 2434.68 speaker3  Mm-hmm.
2433.08 2435.52 speaker0  Like that wasn't that good.
2434.68 2444.28 speaker3  Mm-hmm.
2440.40 2458.92 speaker2  is clearly involved with the testament of the nude flesh. Thank you.
2456.48 2463.80 speaker0  can I just Google that, the testament of the new flesh?
2461.96 2470.40 speaker2  and it autofills.
2469.08 2479.88 speaker3  Have you seen these pictures here? He's even like doing the diagram in his photos. He knows something.
2477.04 2491.04 speaker0  Seeing that pattern that they've seen in the photos, she asks Elwood, if you go to the call logs, are there any numbers, new numbers that start appearing around the same time as that photo pattern?
2489.64 2500.92 speaker3  Let me see here. It looks like there's, yeah, there's one here that he hadn't called before, the 20th. Yeah, it's a new one to him.
2499.44 2504.88 speaker0  When did he last call it?
2502.80 2510.40 speaker3  Click on the info and it says the 23rd. That was the day, three days after the deaths? Two days after the deaths.
2509.08 2522.32 speaker2  Two days after the initial deaths, but the same day as the gas station death. Yeah, what time is the call
2521.24 2528.52 speaker0  The day before.
2525.00 2537.48 speaker2  and then the day that the gas station attendant, Quentin Harris was murdered.
2534.12 2542.08 speaker0  And this is just like a phone number, not a saved contact. It doesn't say like. Not a saved contact. Cool cult number.
2540.16 2555.48 speaker2  It does not say cool cult number. Is it like a New York City number?
2554.28 2557.40 speaker0  No, sorry, shit.
2556.48 2559.54 speaker2  Am I dumb?
2557.40 2565.08 speaker0  Do you not know your nation's area codes?
2563.28 2580.56 speaker2  No, I'm sorry, it's Newark. The first one is two and a half minutes and the second one is 30 seconds.
2579.72 2585.64 speaker0  Oh.
2584.80 2587.36 speaker3  Four times.
2586.52 2604.88 speaker0  Oh my God. Again for the second time. 94.
2603.48 2618.00 speaker2  Yeah, it's raining outside.
2614.16 2628.36 speaker3  but the drowning's been just fine. And when my ears pop and the shell shock of this pit stop frees my mind. I'll be all right. I can go there now that I stare death in the face.
