0.00 224.64 speaker0  Oh, I didn't see you there my babies, come on in. I was just reading this amazing book by a bright new genius author called Finding Your Inner Clam Gravy, Diving Through This Dumpster We Call Life, written by me, Wolf the Dog. It's an autobiography by me, Wolf the Dog, about me, Wolf the Dog, I'll probably never release it though. This book holds far too much knowledge and power, but then again, money does let a dog get closer to his dream of opening a trash can centric theme park. Speaking of trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf is from jdg222 on Instagram, who wrote a 5-star review on iTunes, which is apparently a great way to help guide my dulcet tones into ears that have not yet had my pleasure, mmm delicious. Jeff writes, If Wolf could give a shout out to my companions at The Traveler's Path, that would be amazing. They've been with me through thick and thin. Our handler Alan has given us weeks of adventure. My friends have become brothers and sisters in arms. I can't wait to share more adventures with them. Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick, Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, I love you guys and will see you next session. Now I most certainly will not give a shout out to Aaron, Bob, Justin, Willis, Nick, Connor, Victoria, Emma, and Tony, there's just no way you can make me do it. Remember, if you want to write up something for your Walter Hal, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag Pretending to be People on Facebook, or write a five-star review on iTunes, baby, and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

A big difference between contention police officers and our honorary police officers over on patreon is Wolf the dog loves his honorary police officers. Wolf the dog ain't never been hassled while diving snout first into a dumpster filled with wet sloppy Mississippi roast by one of his honorary police officers. Jesus, last time was grievous.

219.36 253.26 speaker1  This segment of the news comes in the form of a multiple choice question. a. If you answer d.
252.12 302.16 speaker0  Everyone is dead. So let's spread some dread. I got something around here that will fit this somber mood orgastically.
301.16 305.16 speaker2  Are we recording?
302.16 318.56 speaker1  We're always recording.
312.50 351.76 speaker2  I was having a dream where I was riding shotgun with you and we were having this discussion and we were trying to prove points on our phones or whatever basically and you got super distracted from driving and I noticed I look up and I see this young woman in the middle of the road right in front of us that you're about to just plow over and I screamed Luke What did she look like?
350.40 356.36 speaker3  It's weird that there was a car in the dream.
355.24 379.66 speaker2  Luke what was she wearing? She just looked like my dad. Luke I thought your new year's resolution was to not murder anyone this year.
377.76 390.00 speaker3  By the wayside quickly.
386.64 396.24 speaker2  Perfect as it is. Justin?
395.24 409.20 speaker0  Go Kameel.
407.20 416.48 speaker3  Just pumping iron.
415.48 438.04 speaker2  That is true. A lot like that. The other day I went into work and one of my fellow co-workers who does go to the gym greeted me by grabbing my bicep and then immediately looked me in the eyes and said did I just Did he? Oh yeah he got bone baby. What do you mean?
436.72 440.04 speaker3  Of course you can do that.
439.04 467.72 speaker2  It was Phil. Doxum. There's no way I could feel bone in his arm. So it makes sense. Thomas was just groping me that whole time.
463.84 475.08 speaker3  I was just saying like yeah the first time I met you I knew you were going to be a douchebag and then like you weren't and it's crazy to me still. You said that to him or he said that to you? I said that to him.
473.12 479.60 speaker2  That could go either way in my opinion.
475.08 486.64 speaker3  But he was like oh yeah like I get that a lot it kind of sucks but I and then he like
485.64 487.64 speaker2  Confirmed.
486.64 521.12 speaker3  Confirmed.
518.04 543.56 speaker2  The five of you approached the jingle ball. You find students there and faculty there acting strangely and a man began begins screaming of the familiar phrase towel a la coal. Like what what uh?
542.00 553.48 speaker3  And I don't like spells. I've heard enough spells to know they ain't usually good.
546.52 561.48 speaker2  So Keith shot him and these students and faculty, Thomas's great school shooting joke from last Not a joke.
560.20 575.72 speaker3  I just listened to this episode.
571.60 605.98 speaker2  So everyone in this room starts acting even stranger. Thoughts?
604.98 627.80 speaker3  Wow. Never mind.
626.80 671.50 speaker2  His idea. students and faculty all see this and begin acting violently towards themselves and they begin chanting and then the original chanting guy killed himself. After I shot him though. I want to make that clear. Any final thoughts there?
666.70 701.26 speaker3  I don't know that we did the right thing, but guess what? Can't change the past. With the information we've been presented. We did our best. We did. So I was thinking a lot about that. Okay, wait. Hold on.
697.66 744.68 speaker2  And I think hot Santa made us all feel kind of bad about our bodies. Yeah. So I reached out to a few listeners and just kind of asked them a couple of questions about I'm very happy. up out of his own. Listeners like Deborah. Oh shit. He brought him.
743.68 749.68 speaker1  Hey Deborah.
748.68 754.68 speaker2  Fuck.
753.68 775.64 speaker3  Okay. Two doesn't prove anything. No, no, no. Here's the deal. Some listeners have listened to... Jared. Hold on. Jared's trying to talk. Hey. It's Jared here. I totally have this whole podcast figured out. I don't know why you guys don't know what's going on.
774.64 779.64 speaker2  What can you tell us, Jared?
778.64 780.64 speaker3  See?
779.64 785.84 speaker2  Yeah. He's not going to fall for it because it'll be more fun when you guys figure it out eventually.
784.84 802.20 speaker3  Okay.
799.76 804.20 speaker2  apart sometimes, it's hard. It's hard to keep track of those things.
803.20 837.08 speaker3  Excuse me. Excuse me. I was going to say there are some people that have listened to 60-ish hours of this podcast in a row. In a row. We like you. I have listened to this podcast only twice. the second time is week by week for what are we at?
836.08 873.92 speaker2  up the hill. If you did a thousand miles but you had two people, you could break it up and you could each do 500 miles each. Remember five minutes ago when we almost started the episode for the listeners and then we just went back to that bullshit? entire duration of the last episode.
872.92 879.18 speaker3  Not canon. Not canon.
874.92 890.36 speaker2  Retroactively, I would like to say that blaring the entire time during all that super fucked up shit was the classical Paul McCartney Christmas hit, Wonderful Christmas Time, but someone had mashed it up so Danny Brown was rapping Grown Up over the top of it.
889.36 894.88 speaker3  That sounds amazing.
893.88 902.28 speaker2  I know. I'm with you too. The Paul McCartney song. It's one of the most hated Christmas songs.
901.28 903.28 speaker3  It's a great song.
902.28 904.28 speaker2  Really?
903.28 906.28 speaker3  Yeah.
905.28 917.56 speaker2  People really fucking hate it. It's just because they go to the mall and then they hear it 17 times and it's not all I want for Christmas is you.
916.56 941.82 speaker3  It's like Paul. a wonderful Christmas.
940.20 966.64 speaker2  The spirits up. We're here tonight. So as that beautiful, meaningful mashup concludes, the playlist cross fades into the new version of Santa Baby by Tyler, the creator. And the camera slowly pans around to survey the aftermath. Is that real? No, but I wish it was.
965.16 975.14 speaker3  I was like, I've never heard that. I was like, that sounds amazing.
970.06 1038.40 speaker2  The camera pans around to survey the aftermath of these last three minutes. We see two lifeless, partially shaved reindeer next to a dead college student, all sharing all mercy killings of dark red blood. A woman in a bathrobe is splayed headfirst neck snapped in the throne's belly button. Her legs limply akimbo on either side of the armrests. The elves blood has frozen their corpses to the skating rink that has become their grave in the regular place of a mop connected to a mopstick. An upside down naked man is slumped face first and lungs full in the mop bucket. Next to due to a past luck roll by Joe a very sturdy laptop.
1031.16 1041.40 speaker3  Emilia Clark breathes her last breath in the arms of Clark Bishop. Is her name Emilia Clark? It wasn't Emilia Clark, right?
1040.40 1043.40 speaker2  I'm sorry?
1042.40 1045.40 speaker3  What was her actual name? Locke.
1044.40 1050.68 speaker2  Emilia Locke. Oh, motherfucker. I even wrote Emilia Locke.
1047.40 1067.00 speaker3  You have fucked that up literally every single time. I don't think you've said it correctly once.
1066.00 1077.80 speaker2  a little bit to the right. That's appreciated. So I need everyone to roll sanity.
1076.80 1086.80 speaker3  Oh, shit. I pass. Six. I fail. Fail.
1085.80 1099.60 speaker2  Okay. So I am going to need... Oh, I need a... Thanks, baby.
1098.60 1107.52 speaker1  Joe!
1104.60 1110.92 speaker3  And everybody needs to leave the room.
1107.52 1123.00 speaker2  Everyone except me needs to leave the room. When you're at your breaking point, that's... When you're at that number, you hit it, right? Yes. Okay.
1119.44 1125.00 speaker3  I hit my breaking point also, and I am at two sanity now.
1124.00 1127.24 speaker2  Holy shit, y'all.
1126.24 1132.20 speaker3  I had a... I forget.
1131.20 1136.76 speaker1  Like I got really screwed.
1132.20 1144.76 speaker3  I guess mine doesn't go down too often because I don't care when violence happens. You adapted to that. Yeah. What is your sanity? My current sanity is 23 right now. Fuck you. What was your max sanity?
1143.76 1145.76 speaker2  50.
1144.76 1159.32 speaker3  Oh, damn. I think I was down to already like 16 or something like that.
1155.96 1226.52 speaker2  I've been real low since we started this whole second life. I don't think that helped. I don't think it would. Ooh. Which Leon obviously has 100, so that's a crit success. I'm going to hold on to Joe first. Okay, I was... I watched... Oh, we were watching. Oh, actually, hold up.
1224.36 1240.24 speaker3  I think I was running back up the stairs.
1231.40 1300.64 speaker2  The very first person you notice is Leon Simpson, who immediately falls to the ground and starts writhing all over the floor of the Accord Student Union, and he starts chanting. zero, eight, and then he immediately goes and just starts running around trying to find something to write with. He's spreading out any liquid on the floor and drawing these letters out, these numbers all over the ground. numbers on the ground. Are they the same numbers? I'm chanting. No, they are the numbers earlier that you would recognize as Bruce Robin.
1298.04 1321.64 speaker3  Is Leon still occupied with this? Very occupied. Donovan, what did you do to him? I didn't do anything.
1315.68 1328.40 speaker1  Just eyes super wide, looking around, just like, uh, like it's frozen, just paralyzed. I've never experienced this before, so he's just like, uh, very scared.
1327.08 1331.40 speaker3  I'm like, are you okay? Here. You didn't kill anybody, did you?
1330.40 1335.44 speaker1  No, no.
1332.40 1340.46 speaker3  It's kind of a great feeling sometimes, but if you've never done it before, I wouldn't want to help you handle this.
1338.56 1342.20 speaker1  Leon just tried to help me though.
1340.46 1344.24 speaker3  Was he acting like this the whole time or?
1342.20 1354.48 speaker1  No, he just now dropped.
1352.96 1360.24 speaker2  Leon's headphones are on.
1357.64 1368.60 speaker1  I guess I'll take them off, see if it does anything. It does not. Okay.
1367.60 1379.92 speaker3  That is correct. I don't fucking know. I get on my phone and I start trying to decode this number. It says Ben Smith. That was easy.
1378.92 1384.92 speaker2  You've done it before. Have I ever heard that name before?
1382.92 1386.92 speaker3  I Google it.
1385.92 1389.88 speaker2  Yeah.
1387.92 1403.20 speaker3  I Google Ben Smith CSU.
1395.84 1405.52 speaker2  Ben Smith as the one who was standing doing squats on Santa's throne, who initially started
1404.20 1413.60 speaker3  I'm going to go over to... Is he on Santa's throne or what did he impale himself on? On the elf's four poster chair.
1412.44 1443.88 speaker2  Down the stairs from the throne, yeah. Ben Smith, student ID. He's been a CSU student for two years now. There is a piece of paper that has the math that led to 330 Gift's house and then there's another piece of paper that he wrote out the letters to play on the Casio keyboard.
1442.88 1461.32 speaker3  Must have. Does he have the laptop still? The laptop is on the ground, yeah. I'm going to open the laptop up and power it on.
1458.32 1471.32 speaker2  successful luck roll last game. And there are a few things open on the desktop. There are three screenshots from Twitter and two videos.
1469.20 1478.08 speaker3  What are the screenshots of?
1476.92 1480.08 speaker2  right now.
1479.08 1503.96 speaker3  Okay, sweet. Just like text tweets? What are those entitled?
1497.28 1513.80 speaker2  Harriet Marks sitting in her dorm room and the other is a very dark and distorted picture
1508.16 1536.32 speaker3  The one with the candle, does it remind me of like the pictures that we took with the camera? But it doesn't have that same like feel to it. It does not. And the only thing I can see is a candle. Yes. Okay. Go ahead and check out those tweets I just sent.
1531.18 1545.96 speaker2  We got who the tweet came from, what time it was sent, what day it was sent, and what it says.
1541.30 1576.84 speaker1  This seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined ourselves in the lab. Please call 911. Our calls are not going through. 1036 p.m. December 3rd. Call 911. Call 911. Emergency. CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus. Please help us. We are trapped in the lab at CSU. Please call 911. If you're the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart. We are running low on supplies.
1575.56 1597.04 speaker3  And today's date is? The 6th of December. And it is, what time is it now? Like evening? Almost 9 o'clock. It's like 8 30. Where did it say they're quarantined at?
1594.56 1610.72 speaker1  Donovan would know where the biology lab is. Okay.
1608.08 1626.36 speaker3  Yeah, you have to. from the laptop.
1625.36 1644.18 speaker2  Glass Hall? Oh my God, there's one at MSU. So at Missouri State University, we have a glass hall.
1641.48 1667.18 speaker3  years for a bachelor's is pretty, pretty average. Well done, sir. We did it. I focused on booze a little harder than my classes sometimes.
1661.34 1729.82 speaker2  given by a certain person and at that moment I'm going to get Thomas and Joe to join us different. However, this seems to line up perfectly with you hitting your breaking point. So as we've done in the past, I'm going to have you roll a D100 three times and we will choose a mania and this mania will need to overtake all of your decisions, all of your words, all of your role-playing actions for the duration.
1728.82 1732.14 speaker3  No.
1730.82 1771.62 speaker2  Get out of here. Thomas just walked in like he was supposed to be in here, that goofball. Thankfully close. So 82 is photomania, the pathological desire for light.
1768.62 1776.46 speaker1  Well, the left one is the easiest one to do.
1774.94 1795.54 speaker2  I have that in real life. As we both laugh at that. Obsessed and searching for light.
1790.86 1813.86 speaker1  So when you say it takes over my character, can I be involved in discussions now or do I have to be trying to get away from the group to find the light source at all times? Uh huh.
1812.86 1816.86 speaker2  Yeah. Okay.
1815.86 1818.86 speaker1  I think I can do that.
1817.86 1823.86 speaker2  Sounds good. I'm going to grab no one. I'm going to get everyone and then we're going to happen.
1822.86 1852.30 speaker1  Okay.
1845.22 1896.54 speaker2  In Donovan West Haven, the two of you notice the eyes light back up in Clark Bishop and John Lee Pettymore and even in Leon Simpson. And as you notice that happening, Leon Simpson gets up and starts boogieing down. He's shaking his hips, he's snapping his fingers and he starts dancing down the stairs. One thing I have thought is that maybe some of your inspiration for this was like dancing sickness.
1895.10 1903.06 speaker3  and I'm like, look at this.
1902.06 1933.54 speaker2  I meant dancing mania. Do they know what?
1932.54 1938.98 speaker3  Dancing mania.
1936.62 1944.22 speaker2  Wait, that wasn't the page for dancing mania? That's the page for the dancing plague of 1518, which is one of the most famous.
1942.74 1958.42 speaker3  My guess is of the dancing prion. I thought it was like a sickness.
1957.42 1977.22 speaker2  Yes. No, I've seen people speak in tongues and I don't think they're doing it on purpose. I always threw in the F word.
1971.78 1989.30 speaker3  As a sixth grader, I realized I was an atheist when I went to James river church camp and they made us speak in tongues and I was like, oh, this isn't real.
1982.94 2027.46 speaker2  So I just sent you guys screenshots of three tweets that were screenshotted and saved onto the desktop of this computer. The other two things on this desktop are videos and the like screenshot, the screen cap of each video. One is of a woman, the young woman that you recognize as Harriet marks. She's sitting in her dorm room. It looks to be like a webcam video and the other is a video that is very dark and distorted looking and you can only make out a candle in the middle of the frame.
2024.58 2032.54 speaker1  screen until his forehead is just touching the screen.
2028.90 2042.94 speaker3  I'm like, his forehead is touching the screen for like five or six seconds. And I'm like, Clark, what, what do you, what are you doing? That's all. Can you read those?
2041.94 2070.26 speaker1  Read what? Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. Uh, the first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us, I'm sorry, these are tweets. They're screenshots of tweets from the CSU biology department says, uh, this seems crazy.
2069.26 2073.98 speaker2  together. Maybe you had Justin do it.
2071.26 2076.90 speaker3  This is a lot of, uh, this is a lot of work as well.
2073.98 2095.50 speaker2  GIMPs transfer, um, pneumatic image processing. It's, it's a free, it's a free alternative to Photoshop. That's fairly popular. Doesn't pneumatic start with a P? Wouldn't it be PIMP? It's new. It's GNU. It's some fucking freeware shit.
2091.02 2140.08 speaker1  The first one says, this seems crazy, but a few of us who are not infected have quarantined ourselves in the lab. Please call 911. Our calls are not going through and they didn't finish writing the word through. Uh, the second one says in all caps, call 911, call 911. Emergency CSU campus is infected with some sort of virus. Please help us. We are trapped in the lab at CSU. Please call 911. And the third and last tweet says, we're still quarantined in the lab. If you are the person or entity scrubbing this page, please have a heart. We are running low on supplies. So the first, the first tweet is dated December 3rd.
2137.80 2145.64 speaker2  This ain't really dramatic.
2143.80 2153.08 speaker3  He knows where the lab is. It's in, it's in glass hall.
2152.08 2156.80 speaker2  Exactly.
2155.68 2163.88 speaker3  Well, finance it. But anyway, I was thinking, I think we got to go help. See what's going on there.
2162.40 2167.20 speaker1  I think we should, uh, we should investigate the lab. I mean, if they're survivors.
2166.20 2178.12 speaker3  Well that's what I'm thinking. They probably have, I mean, Donovan's a survivor and he's not, hasn't tried to hurt us yet. So I think we might as well try to go help some other people.
2177.12 2183.92 speaker2  Donovan.
2182.92 2186.92 speaker1  I pass.
2185.92 2210.74 speaker2  I pass a 54 and a 60.
2209.18 2212.02 speaker1  We'll drop it later.
2210.74 2224.74 speaker3  Well, actually, you know what?
2223.74 2230.66 speaker1  You're just in the grid.
2228.02 2233.98 speaker3  I found out his last name isn't the creator. That's wild.
2232.66 2234.98 speaker2  No, they can't just, you can't just lie like that.
2233.98 2236.98 speaker3  Apparently he does. No, it's not bad boy.
2235.98 2279.02 speaker2  Legal. The room goes completely silent as the song ends and looking over, the only thing you hear is the tapping feet of Leon Simpson as he is just fucking grinding and getting it on the dance floor that no longer exists. But you also hear the phone in his pocket is buzzing incessantly. Oh yeah.
2278.02 2338.38 speaker3  Get down. As he's doing that, I gather Clark and John and I'm like, Hey, Donovan just watches. what I'm doing. same numbers and I looked it up and uh, it's for a name, Ben Smith. And uh, I looked it up and it's, it's that one right there.
2330.14 2347.86 speaker2  first to chant Tawa Alakol before diving neck first on the four poster chair that the elf
2341.02 2360.54 speaker3  You guys, we, we've been, you know, chanting and writing numbers that are for Bruce Robin and Bruce was doing it for Harriet Marks, but Leon's doing it for Ben Smith.
2358.26 2378.42 speaker1  Did Leon do anything with Ben's body? What was he, was he doing anything? He just crumpled to the ground. He started chanting the numbers and writhing like he was in pain. Just all of a sudden.
2377.42 2399.82 speaker3  Yeah, out of nowhere. I saw it. I thought it was having a seizure at first until he started talking and, and uh, he was chanting the numbers and, and, and right, like trying to write them down on the ground. It was, I don't know how these numbers affect us.
2397.86 2429.54 speaker1  That's basically our whole job here. Clack. Yes. All right, Keith, you got any ideas?
2423.78 2447.26 speaker3  Bruce Robin's numbers because, well, I mean, we didn't kill him, but I mean, basically we did. So I was thinking that he might've killed Harriet Marks, but now that doesn't make any sense cause, cause Leon didn't kill Ben Smith. Bruce Robin killed himself. That's right.
2442.54 2465.08 speaker1  So in our, in our presence, is it when I was doing numbers just now, was I doing Ben Smith? So maybe if you're in proximity of somebody who's doing the Talia Lecourt thing, you start saying the numbers of their death? Maybe, but I still just don't know what it means. I'm thinking maybe Bruce Robbins is the one that's infected me and I can't be reinfected by a new one.
2464.08 2496.62 speaker3  Could be. it recently. I just haven't, both times that you guys have done it when I've seen you, you just, it was like you left for a little bit. I don't know.
2495.62 2509.66 speaker2  That's the electric slide. the right.
2508.66 2523.78 speaker1  I tried.
2519.62 2556.62 speaker3  you were just not in reality and I slapped Leon and nothing happened. I came up and I slapped you to try to get you out of it and nothing. You just kept on and both times it's happened that I've seen, I just wait for you to snap back into it. I feel the pain of all crashes. I think we need to get over to that lab. I don't know if we should bring Leon with us or the agony.
2553.18 2567.90 speaker1  I'm not going to hit him, but I'm going to like shake him by the shoulders. I've been rolling 48 and 47s on different dice all night.
2566.90 2573.22 speaker3  65. Damn. Joe regained some health.
2570.90 2582.62 speaker2  Joe regained some luck.
2581.62 2595.02 speaker1  Like Joe? Holy shit. Wow.
2591.38 2596.02 speaker2  It must have worked cause Joe got chills.
2595.02 2598.90 speaker1  Joe chill.
2597.02 2653.70 speaker2  You killed Batman's parents. And Clark shakes Leon who does not stop dancing, however, his buzzing cell phone falls out of his trousers. It falls to the ground and you see that a number that is unknown is calling and then the call ends and it has 25 missed calls from unknown and a few texts as well. I want to read them texts straight away. And it seems like it's only a matter of time before unknown calls again. Also this, uh, this phone pretty bright for the room. Nice. What do you mean? Pretty bright for the room. It just like has a nice glow to it because it's dance party time at the jingle ball.
2652.70 2655.70 speaker3  Yes. Okay.
2654.70 2687.50 speaker2  Gotcha. Hey, maybe don't save it as a JPEG next time. You are doing such a good job of reading.
2686.50 2707.82 speaker3  I'm proud of you.
2704.60 2718.38 speaker2  The secretary is stubborn looking for another option. I don't want excuses. Pick up. Okay. Oh, sorry. That is not as clear as I thought it would not clear at all.
2715.90 2763.14 speaker1  So the first message is from unknown and it says, how's it going? They say, I don't want excuses. Pick up. Okay. I sent them T O it's capitalized to, we'll be ready for extraction. Don't forget to get the signatures ETA question mark, and then another question mark. That's also from unknown. And then three, three question marks. And then if he doesn't get here in time, this is all over everything we've worked for. Everything that exists just gone for what your fucking conscience, morality won't save us.
2762.14 2782.38 speaker3  Clark. What are you looking at?
2777.14 2802.58 speaker1  I did realize that, uh, Joe and I think probably Clark would to figure it out why that T O is capitalized. That's the overseer. I believe. Dang. Nice. It says, okay. I sent them. The overseer will be ready for extraction. Don't forget the signatures. I don't exactly know what any of it means, but it sounds like they were preparing for
2801.58 2816.82 speaker3  the overseer. Why?
2813.98 2865.62 speaker1  This person seems to know Leon and knows what's going on. Do you think I should just say Leon is compromised or Leon's got the numbers in him or just
2860.30 2877.52 speaker2  you say it's you or no, no, we, we should pretend to be Leon on this phone unless we my fist.
2876.52 2901.96 speaker1  we've worked for. Anything that exists gone for what your fucking conscience morality won't save us. So was this some kind of side mission that Leon was having us on? I thought, I figured it was coming down from Maggie yourself, but Oh, maybe this is probably Maggie isn't it? It could be.
2899.64 2912.12 speaker3  Just text back Maggie question mark. He'd know that. Well, he doesn't know anything right now. I don't know. But I mean, Leon. Leon don't know anything right now.
2911.12 2950.34 speaker2  Hold on. Hold on. I don't know if we could indicate that Leon is compromised. I have a student here.
2949.34 2965.76 speaker3  Yeah. Text that and then let's go to the lab. Let's just go to the lab. Fuck Maggie. I'm just going to take I'm going to say, Hey, it's Clark.
2963.00 2976.76 speaker1  If we think it's her, I'll say, Hey, it's Clark and it will see what happens with the reply. If it's like, who's Clark? I'm going to I do that. I reply back. Leon's compromised.
2975.76 2989.20 speaker3  Okay. Well, while we wait for a text back, I think we ought to go to the lab and check that out.
2988.20 3002.16 speaker1  Yeah. You can keep dancing.
2998.24 3007.40 speaker3  try to like push him in front of me and I'm like, let's just lead him that way. I mean, I don't know if we should leave him. He'll keep dancing.
3006.40 3009.40 speaker1  Sure. Let's do it.
3008.40 3024.48 speaker3  Where you lead.
3018.72 3066.16 speaker2  but he just seems to speak out of like pure knowledge affecting thousands of people across several centuries. Dancing mania was not an isolated event and was well-documented. Well-documented in contemporary reports. It was nevertheless poorly understood and remedies were based on guesswork. Often musicians accompanied dancers due to belief that music would treat the mania, but this sometimes backfired. No fucking chance. There is no consensus among modern day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.
3064.44 3096.46 speaker1  That's real interesting.
3095.46 3111.70 speaker2  Everybody run the alertness.
