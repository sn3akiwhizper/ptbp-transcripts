0.00 36.52 speaker0  Hello, all, and welcome to the best radio show in town. I'm here to say things, and you are here to listen. A perfect relationship. Sometimes, you're here to say things, and I'm here to listen.
31.96 45.92 speaker1  and tagged at PretendingPod, an easy and nice thing
43.20 56.96 speaker0  with your online friendos. Cupcake Sinclair writes, PTBP equals amazing. I'm hooked, and I love the reminder
54.40 165.40 speaker1  that sex work is real work. There is discrimination not only from society, but credit cards dictating what can appear. For example, TV can film sleeping, hypnosis, et cetera, but we cannot. I ask listeners to please consider how hypocritical laws passed against sex workers are a canary in the coal mine for wider changes that will affect us all down the road, especially in terms of what consenting adults do. And that's just porn. You know a sex worker whether you realize or not. Thank you guys for your hard work, the hilarity you bring, and the consideration of my announcement. Thanks for all the shout outs and praise. Let's make sure we all support sex workers' rights. If you wanna write up something for your little Wolfie to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter, of your choice. in the wettest broadcasting studio this side of the Mississippi. And this side, it means under. without having to type a single letter? All of our links are where? Say it with me, children. In the show notes.
163.24 171.04 speaker0  It's wild stuff in there.
168.32 274.28 speaker1  with these big ol' nasty paws. Please acknowledge my hard work and excellent use of language. Now dial up for some vile fluff. It's time for the news. who witnessed something wildly unnatural back in the day. He was at a dig site with the charming and capable Dr. Brock Hargrave, as well as Jimmy Corrigan, a badass merc with a soft spot for his wife and children. A woman with myriad names, a shrinking frame, and the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh continued building her personal strike team and an even better eye for new employees. They received their assignment in this emaciated woman's house that reeked of cat piss, sans the cats. and just didn't come back, but his missing coworker seemingly never left the office building of Holy Cow Farms, taking us now to the death two-car convoy
271.72 280.80 speaker0  Well, this team may be fucked, but at least we have Hudson Freeman
279.96 330.96 speaker1  Let's go. Let's go. What's up, everybody? I was thinking the same thing.
328.28 344.88 speaker0  All my muscles work like screams. What's up, everybody? Welcome to episode two of this short story here on pretending to be people. It's Holy Cow Farms time.
344.04 351.44 speaker1  Holy Cow Farms. Holy cow.
349.96 386.48 speaker2  that are currently named that. So pretty good pun. Pretty good. Yeah. Or we can go break into their facilities. We should do that. that's in Arkansas just as a tribute to this episode. We should role play inside. We are all cousins. Us, Paul Rudd, who else? Jon Hamm. That's right. Lord. Mark Twain. Ellie Kemper. John Goodman.
385.12 390.44 speaker4  Good pull, yes.
389.32 391.72 speaker3  She's from KC though.
390.44 396.08 speaker4  Did you say John Goodman? No, I said John Goodman.
395.24 402.48 speaker3  Oh yeah, Brad Pitt.
400.20 418.72 speaker4  I found out something terrible about Brad Pitt. Even though he grew up here and spent his formative years in Springfield.
415.72 422.00 speaker3  to harm the reputation of our Lord and Savior, Brad Pitt.
420.48 441.64 speaker2  This is the Jesus podcast.
439.36 445.08 speaker3  But did he feel bad about it?
443.44 448.84 speaker4  Did any of you see that? I did see it. I still haven't seen it.
446.76 449.68 speaker2  Bullet train, so fucking good.
448.84 468.44 speaker4  Did you see it Becca? You should. It's a fun one. I heard Luke and Joe liked it. but it was great. It was like a live action anime starring Brad Pitt.
467.60 476.92 speaker3  That's a great pitch.
474.08 482.48 speaker2  I'm sure you've shared this many, many times before, but what brought you to this lovely hobby
480.64 528.36 speaker3  The money, baby. Fuck yeah, bro. No, hey, I was just a bystander when crit role started. Having snacks in the kitchen with them at Geek and Sundry, and we played all kinds of other role-playing games there. And at first, so competitive board gaming is my jam. I love it. Love me some magic, love me any competitive board game. that you don't need to win, in fact, it's way more fun to lose terribly, that's when role-playing really clicked for me. And I also have an acting background from the University of Missouri, Kansas City.
527.28 532.40 speaker4  I've driven by there.
530.20 538.20 speaker3  So, you know, I just get to act, but with only my voice and that's real fun.
536.20 550.48 speaker4  Do you act with your whole body anyway while you're doing voice acting?
548.08 556.68 speaker2  Are you doing that like just for no one?
554.20 572.16 speaker3  I do wiggle my arms in the air. Like they're little serpents that are helping me to explain the product. Magic the Gathering. Hell yeah.
570.32 586.10 speaker2  And it's a good tie-in for Delta Green, because one of the artists on the original Magic the Gathering run was one of the creators of this game that we're playing this evening, Delta Green.
585.26 587.18 speaker4  Me too.
586.10 596.70 speaker3  You know those OG artists, there's some fucked up shit in some of that card stuff.
594.18 600.94 speaker2  I'll Google Dennis Stettwiller canceled later and we'll find out.
599.38 618.74 speaker3  That's a leading question.
615.94 677.88 speaker2  as you're driving, sitting in this car, because it feels like Magic being inside a vehicle for the third time in your life, Meat Hook. And we see the holy cow of magic cards and we see the holy cow farms office building, except for holy cow farm seems to share this office building with a few other companies listed on the sign out front. It is a very boxy, nondescript office building with a large parking lot where you can park wherever you would like. Today is a Tuesday. It is 8.57 PM, almost nine o'clock. The parking lot is dark. There are orange lights, lighting up specific segments. And there is a van parked up near the door that says trolleys cleaning service. And it's the van has like a paint job, like it's a trolley car.
674.68 693.16 speaker4  I've used those guys a hell of a lot. They keep the mouth shut. They do all sorts.
691.96 701.96 speaker3  Oh, of course, yes. Do you need someone to live in the basement or something?
700.46 711.60 speaker0  It does get lonely there at times.
710.48 743.32 speaker3  being your basement creep. That's all the details I can really tell you. There was a street sign once, but somebody ripped it down and nobody ever fixed it.
741.00 752.90 speaker4  and I'll say, oh, there's the basement creep. That's how I know you found the place.
750.20 759.36 speaker2  You know, it could really use some companies. He's going a little bit batty.
757.00 789.48 speaker3  I mean, people tell me I'm batty all the time just because I stand on street corners handing out leaflets. Yeah, you want a leaflet? Here. If you've got one, of course, yes. Let me read your literature. That one's about how we need to be teaching kids about the underground digging because we're all gonna have to be mole people someday.
787.56 798.56 speaker4  Yes, get the children digging early on. They might find things in the ground and that ties directly into my profession.
796.58 805.12 speaker2  Yeah, I'd like to see one of those pamphlets too.
804.28 811.36 speaker4  Oh.
809.38 825.08 speaker3  that you find there sometimes. But that's not the real purpose. The purpose is if we don't teach our kids to be mole people now, they're gonna be really not used to living without sunlight.
822.92 830.00 speaker2  but I am 100% in agreement with you
828.44 832.24 speaker3  Do you wanna put them underground?
830.08 838.92 speaker2  I desperately want my kids underground.
837.08 847.74 speaker4  Enough about this underground shit. I've got my eyes up to the skies. They call me the Rock Man, if you didn't know that.
846.20 860.36 speaker3  Rocket Man.
856.00 874.60 speaker4  at all, except Billy Joel.
872.12 883.32 speaker3  Bach never existed.
878.32 892.72 speaker2  Hey, Becca, can you roll a 50-50 up and down roll for me? If he knows what's good for him. So if you roll under 50, it'll be a luck success.
890.68 899.24 speaker3  Wolfgang Amadeus who?
897.08 905.60 speaker4  Those words mean literally nothing to me.
902.52 916.72 speaker3  Oh, sorry, I thought someone else was rolling. Oh, no, sorry.
913.56 937.74 speaker2  And so one of the cleaners comes down and you see that they open up the front door and walk over to the van and they go into the back of the van.
934.28 956.52 speaker3  I slip out the limousine Escalade and I creep up behind them and I wanna attack by jumping from flat footed on the ground to onto their shoulders
954.76 965.20 speaker2  or unarmed combat for this?
962.88 970.32 speaker3  Yeah, I wish there was hard success in this game because I rolled a 12 under 50.
969.16 1010.72 speaker2  They failed on their check, so you can easily jump. but don't look back in time and suddenly there's a tiny little dirty person on this cleaner's back and they're on their phone.
1008.12 1017.96 speaker3  until they can't yell anymore.
1015.96 1082.56 speaker2  So that'll. Yeah, one D4 minus one, and I'll give you an additional D4 that actually takes down half of their hit points in one fell swoop, and they failed their constitution check to stay conscious, which works out quite well for your plans. As this person hits the ground and their cell phone with it smashes onto the ground and you just hear a voice coming out. Yeah, it was a woman that you jumped on.
1081.28 1092.56 speaker3  I betrayed her. Well, too late.
1091.72 1100.24 speaker2  Those cleaners.
1098.92 1111.96 speaker3  I see what you're saying.
1109.04 1129.84 speaker2  with basically some normal keys, as well as some like scan cards that are attached to this ring. And you see this phone also on the ground that-
1128.28 1133.24 speaker3  Close enough.
1132.40 1138.72 speaker4  Hold on.
1136.60 1141.52 speaker2  He rolled to say that. You had to roll to see
1139.56 1204.92 speaker4  if she should do the name of the podcast.
1203.16 1225.36 speaker2  And that's the scariest thing this person on the other end has ever heard. A different voice than their friend, Dorothy, has taken the phone, says that, and you hear a deadline on the other end of this.
1224.04 1234.84 speaker4  Thank you, doctor. You're going to be a really valuable asset to the family after this, if you survive. We don't even know why the cleaners were here.
1232.40 1240.88 speaker2  This kid's going to get us all killed.
1237.88 1259.60 speaker3  I already get to be somebody's basement troll. We're friends, a guy with spats on his shoes, and this guy's, he's going to let me teach his kids to dig on the ground.
1258.76 1292.88 speaker4  What? He thinks to himself. He starts swinging the key ring around his finger and just kind of jaunts into the open door that Dorothy came out of.
1290.00 1301.92 speaker3  some laminated name tags printed out?
1299.96 1332.72 speaker5  No, I don't know.
1331.28 1336.12 speaker2  A well-timed flashback.
1334.64 1342.04 speaker3  Oh, do you read minds?
1337.88 1376.96 speaker2  Are you going with some sort of governmental agency? What kind of cover would you have? Bug spray? I'm a milk tester. That's right. So classic milk tech group here. Yeah, and like Luke said, the door is open and unlocked as you go over there. I think you're the only one over there with the door open
1375.64 1384.88 speaker4  Hey, door's open.
1384.04 1398.80 speaker2  on your own. Drag her into the van, just like that.
1396.76 1408.12 speaker3  You teach, you don't do for it. You know, you got to teach me to fish.
1406.20 1431.12 speaker2  your name tag says bean dad. Bean dad? Bean dad's a wild internet. Oh, I remember bean dad. It's pretty sad.
1430.24 1442.44 speaker5  Okay, sorry. Wait, fish face? Yeah.
1441.60 1456.04 speaker3  Nevermind.
1455.04 1461.48 speaker2  Come on, let's hang out. Okay, Miwok, all right.
1460.32 1471.64 speaker4  It's going to take a while
1470.20 1481.28 speaker2  Wait, hold on, kid. That's exactly right. I think you're a natural.
1479.16 1489.92 speaker3  but the spirits speak to me. but it's more like another dimension. I got a pamphlet about it.
1488.68 1493.24 speaker4  Let's review this pamphlet.
1491.36 1505.88 speaker3  Well, maybe we should go into this dairy farm before whoever was on the line to Dorothy
1502.52 1514.60 speaker4  he reads aloud, just sometimes spirits talk to me. Oh, nice. Fascinating. Cool, kid.
1513.00 1543.60 speaker2  but I haven't seen anything in these pamphlets that would disqualify you from a career in extensive stretch limousineery. of this office building inside, it's just got the different names on which floors they're on. And you see that Holy Cow Farms is on the eighth floor
1541.04 1554.32 speaker4  in having known Hargrave and being a colleague,
1553.08 1659.52 speaker2  While I think of something. Yeah, exactly. For being aware of the profession. With all of your knowledge of the field of anthropology. he knows the man through his study. I mean, you see there's like a dermatologist on the first floor, there's a cafe on the second floor, on the third floor, there's a psychic holding the same floor as a kid's play land. And on the fourth floor, there's a massage parlor. There's a bunch of places, none of which stand out to you. But you're confident that whatever he was looking for connection wise, it's probably at holy cow farms. Which is what the handler had circled in the name of the scenario. And on the seventh floor, it says psychic kids. Psychic children. Psychic kids in adult play bed.
1657.76 1661.16 speaker5  Yeah, the other tracks.
1659.52 1664.44 speaker2  One adult fits in at a time.
1662.68 1669.68 speaker3  Does Trolley's cleaning service
1667.20 1672.52 speaker2  No, they seem to have been here cleaning.
1670.64 1678.00 speaker3  I've done a little detective work. These cleaners?
1677.04 1683.76 speaker5  Yes, very good.
1682.12 1704.36 speaker2  you see the same kind of sign with all the different listings for the floors as well as the buttons on elevators where you click them to make it go up. but it doesn't do anything.
1701.40 1711.00 speaker4  No, especially if there's only 12 stories to it. And he clicks the eighth button.
1710.16 1711.84 speaker2  Hold it.
1711.00 1720.40 speaker4  Okay, sounds good.
1717.16 1777.76 speaker2  We're gonna use the layout for the office office. Tight. So in front of you, you see- A UK or American. Based on the scripts of the first season. And so you see the round desk ahead of you, coat rack on the right. And yeah, the lights are off. There seems to be no one here. You fumble around with the keys. You're looking at that all through the glass door. Looking around the keys, you see that one of the key cards is for Holy Cow Farms. The light turns green, door opens. On the other side, you hear the van. Way outside running still. When the windows are open, it's hot, it's July. They're trying to air it out.
1776.92 1802.28 speaker4  of this building. It would make my job a lot easier if I came here to do my normal job. Window cleaning.
1800.24 1808.92 speaker3  I wonder what they're trying to air out.
1806.32 1812.76 speaker2  Go ahead and roll alertness or search.
1811.84 1821.44 speaker3  Search. And I needed a 50.
1819.52 1829.72 speaker2  Sniffing the air, meat hook, you smell something burning or burnt.
1828.88 1836.16 speaker4  Okay.
1835.32 1862.68 speaker2  Obviously share the information. And you notice that there's a trash can nearby with a bunch of burnt popcorn that's been tossed into it. there's no one in here that you can see. So this is going to be kind of an exploration kind of thing. What are you looking for? Where are you going?
1860.08 1876.92 speaker4  and just like looking for blood.
1874.28 1984.08 speaker2  all right, I'll teach you how to smell. your sniffer smells the exact same cigarette smoke and burnt popcorn that the others have been smelling. that you see some paperwork strewn about. And you notice, oh, this is- It's covered in blood that he missed. It's hand prints all the way up. This is help. No, you see Dr. Brock Hargrave's desk here at Holy Cow Farms. You see a picture of him. You see lots of papers all over his desk that have his name on them. And there is a computer at his workstation as well as a large file cabinet. like 14, 16 desks around the office and little pods. This guy sat in Dwight's desk. Yeah, I pick his phone like of Jell-O, toss it aside. on this expedition that you are in the picture, you were in the expedition, but the way he's holding out his arm in gleeful triumph is blocking your face from being seen in the picture.
1982.92 1996.12 speaker4  I promise, that's me there. You can't quite see my face, but I was once a person who would go on these expeditions like this.
1995.20 2002.36 speaker3  Yeah, I see.
2000.92 2034.28 speaker4  Stand aside, let me look, and I start rummaging through his papers.
2033.28 2049.66 speaker5  You asked for it.
2047.90 2065.14 speaker3  We'll just totally ruin the adventure
2063.36 2084.78 speaker4  I'm not gonna let a stupid book beat me. That's what we call Zach. with Scott Dorwood, the guy who wrote it. And it was really fun to see you guys do
2082.02 2094.06 speaker3  Oh man, yeah, that was a Bleak one. That was so fun. That's amazing.
2092.18 2105.62 speaker4  He's run us through some of his stuff.
2103.10 2132.34 speaker3  On an award-winning podcast. They won best podcasts at the Innies. It was The Daily. Love it.
2130.30 2140.58 speaker4  to shuffle through all those papers.
2138.34 2186.86 speaker2  Lights start going off. Red lights illuminate the entirety of this office. And a small voice says, Hello, an intrusion has been found here. Please call security if this was a mistake.
2186.02 2205.58 speaker4  I think you're right. I hang up the phone.
2204.74 2213.66 speaker3  Pfft.
2211.38 2232.86 speaker2  continuing to illuminate your search, I need everyone who is searching to go ahead and roll a search check for me. We'll see what you find in this place.
2231.42 2244.26 speaker4  knowing that this building bought one of his security systems.
2241.34 2258.90 speaker3  You know, computers, not my thing. Eight and a half by 11, I need a four by six square leaflet.
2258.06 2282.14 speaker2  I love that.
2281.30 2293.74 speaker3  Oh, zines. Oh yeah, all my life, baby.
2292.66 2369.82 speaker2  with your critical success, we're going to come back to you. Okay. The success was Vincenti Boeri. Yes? Yes. Thank you. As you're going through the desk, you're kind of feeling around and you feel underneath, there's this kind of wooden piece that is sticking out. And when you flick it, a false bottom comes out from the main drawer of this desk. When it pops down, you see it's full of notes about things that have been brought to Trigate Supply. You see a map of the city with little dots poking around in a specific kind of layout at the Zeitgeist, which is an abandoned space needle here in the city. for giving us the Zeitgeist. Nice. And while we're here, shout out to Zakharov Salyer, another $10 up patron for Trigate Supply. you see a handwritten note scrawled on the bottom corner of one of these pages that says,
2367.70 2382.18 speaker3  but definitely not as much about crystals and stuff found in the earth. What's this Strummer's thing?
2379.34 2388.18 speaker2  called Strummer's Resonating Crystals, and it is owned by Aaron Strummer.
2387.06 2394.78 speaker4  Yee-haw. The land of actual crystal shops.
2393.62 2411.26 speaker5  Whoopee. Is he trying to do me in?
2409.46 2427.42 speaker4  Is he trying to finish me off for good? but in general, this guy needs to have less space in your head.
2425.30 2460.82 speaker2  and he walks off into the other room and walks directly into the security room with some TVs around and different like VHS tapes lining the wall with different dates on it and tiny little security TVs that you could play them on. Nobody here though? There's nobody here now. You just walk right into this room. Looking around, it just seems to be looking at holy cow farms only, not the rest of the building. I kind of turn...
2459.06 2473.02 speaker5  I believe I found the nerve center for the security operation. We might be able to see what may have happened that day that Hargrave left and his coworker disappeared.
2468.14 2489.46 speaker4  Well, if the security system is all my security system, it's probably not gonna work great, It is expensive.
2485.94 2496.46 speaker2  as the red lights are just like blinking and flashing.
2495.62 2519.22 speaker4  The lights... 22 on a 10. Very cool. I'm sure there is.
2517.46 2524.82 speaker2  You seem like you're really trying to come up with something. Italian.
2522.50 2540.70 speaker4  It's an Italian security system. And I speak to the security guys in Italian on the phone.
2538.02 2562.34 speaker2  This is one of those excellent times Not a chance in this case. As you call your own security company, they have your direct number. So someone picks up there.
2560.54 2568.38 speaker4  that Holy Cow Farms is in. So turn off the alarm.
2566.50 2588.22 speaker2  No, what do you mean? How do you know? What do you mean? Who called you? I'm sorry to kind of bark up the ladder, but I feel like maybe following orders isn't what you hired me to do. You hired me because I'm a small individual who thinks of myself, you know?
2585.38 2589.06 speaker5  You'll never make that mistake again.
2588.22 2592.42 speaker4  Fuck. And he hangs up.
2591.58 2597.10 speaker5  Fantastic.
2593.54 2620.62 speaker4  Oh, hey, that might be your first job out of here. Oh. I call back and get that guy's name. I thought you were offering this kid Forget I said anything. We'll talk about it afterwards. And then he just writes down the guy's name that was on the phone.
2617.58 2633.78 speaker2  when we're three grandfathers living. Yeah, wack. It's Shelly's family. Exactly wacky.
2632.06 2641.70 speaker4  Dinner's ready, basement rat.
2640.66 2677.04 speaker2  Now, now. Shelly St. Blythe has been dutifully going through the different VHS cassettes and finding the day that is just from two days ago. The day that was the last time that Dr. Brock Hargrave had come into Holy Cow Farms and the day that his coworker did not ever clock out. And you see on the security footage, the two of them around, I don't know, 3.30, walk into the kitchen area where there's no camera present.
2674.38 2682.02 speaker3  You gotta see who steals your yogurt, I imagine,
2678.70 2687.94 speaker5  That's the prime place where most office thefts occurs, the kitchen.
2686.74 2752.94 speaker2  Yeah. He is wearing the exact same clothes that you've always seen him in. He is in full-blown field archaeologist gear working at this office. Yep, cowboy hat included. And when he walks out of this kitchen area back into frame, into the office, he is holding an open yogurt container. The spoon is just like hanging limply in his other hand, his mouth agape as it looks down. And the hand with the spoon in it kind of rubs at his belly, looks up directly into the security camera, turns around, looks back at the room where he came from, looks back at the security camera, nervously smiles, looking at his belly and rubbing it continuously as he walks back.
2749.70 2758.26 speaker5  this the friend appear again on cameras?
2754.92 2764.94 speaker2  as you skim through, you do not see this coworker.
2762.34 2772.26 speaker3  Is that his normal sort of behavior?
2768.38 2780.78 speaker5  but no, in general, he does not rub his belly, satisfied after a meal.
2777.98 2792.08 speaker4  was when he ate a man.
2789.18 2800.22 speaker5  That friend could still be somewhere in that kitchen as we speak.
2796.08 2803.26 speaker2  you hear sirens in the distance through the open windows of the eighth floor of this office building.
2802.42 2842.90 speaker3  Oh, right. That time we called security and pretended to be someone. And now I'm thinking maybe she knew I wasn't pretending to be people so good.
2841.02 2858.94 speaker2  cleanly if you leave now. If you search the kitchen, you're going to maybe risk it. Just like a quick pop open the fridge Oh, there's no body in the fridge. All right, let's get the fuck out of here.
2855.90 2865.78 speaker4  and wants to look around just a little harder.
2863.94 2874.06 speaker3  Even though, let me tell you, the fastest way to the sewer is through the toilet. Since you asked.
2872.72 2885.18 speaker4  Vincenty agrees, he's like.
2882.54 2893.02 speaker3  they might have an industrial sized one. They got cows here.
2891.78 2902.70 speaker2  Here in the office office, Well, yeah, that's why there's not cow shit everywhere. That's exactly right, because the cow shitter,
2900.94 2908.18 speaker4  the single one.
2906.46 2912.90 speaker3  Are we running out the back door?
2910.26 2924.10 speaker2  do you think, I don't know if I'm gonna live.
2921.52 2939.26 speaker4  he has cleaned up in kitchens. Natch. And he's like, I've never committed a crime in a kitchen, I guess.
2935.54 2950.26 speaker2  You guys take off running out of this office, closing the door behind you. Is anyone trying to clean up any of the mess that you've made since you've been here, shoving everything kind of back where it was?
2948.74 2954.26 speaker4  The only mess would be Hargrave's desk, right?
2951.10 2961.70 speaker5  Then yeah, probably as we're running past it, he would try to at least close up the secret panel that had the stuff inside it.
2959.64 2972.34 speaker2  And you guys head down the hallway,
2971.14 2977.96 speaker5  You click the button.
2975.90 2982.50 speaker4  falling down the stairs.
2979.74 2995.50 speaker2  Go ahead and roll athletics. Well.
2993.78 3008.80 speaker5  Oh no, did we all fail? I failed. For some dry ramen.
3007.10 3021.58 speaker4  Vincenti passes. Oh, he just fucking dies? Oh, wait.
3018.14 3027.98 speaker5  hanging off the railing in awkward angles.
3025.14 3041.26 speaker2  as you've made it down the end of this un-air conditioned stairwell in July heat here in the city. It is sweltering and you all are dripping mops when you arrive at the bottom.
3038.86 3055.68 speaker4  In the meantime, I turn around and saw that they were not gonna make it out quick enough. So, Vincenti runs out the door they came in. Yep. Runs a couple streets down and fires off a couple shots on his gun.
3053.94 3093.98 speaker2  Yeah, you ran two blocks. So, Vincenti, you are a block away, away from the parking lot and you are firing your gun in the air as the rest of you get into the...
3092.68 3102.34 speaker3  This is the thing I'm good at.
3100.14 3109.46 speaker5  Believe it or not, I'm pretty fit for my age. 65.
3108.34 3118.86 speaker4  I've never been in that good a shape. I just got lucky today.
3116.30 3151.66 speaker2  You see sirens in the distance, they turn and as they're heading down the street that would lead them to the parking lot for this exact reasoning, they hear the gunshots and immediately make a turn and begin heading in your direction. pull up to the front of the office building. I ran in to grab my Jeep. You sprint across the parking lot to your Jeep as these sirens are getting closer and they are barreling down on Vincente Bowery.
3149.26 3164.50 speaker4  He puts his gun back in his briefcase
3160.34 3181.54 speaker2  and so the security car pulls up in front of you and the window rolls down and I want you to roll a charisma real quick right off the bat. Actually, no, don't roll. Tell me what your charisma is. Passive. 80. Jesus Christ. Yeah, could my 80 athletics have gotten me
3180.70 3185.90 speaker4  No.
3185.06 3221.28 speaker2  No. And he points right to where you just were like two minutes ago.
3216.28 3253.42 speaker4  with like super long hair and really huge long fingernails of where I, I heard him say he's going that way. I said, I'm getting way far away from him, he's scary. And so that's why I'm walking this way.
3252.58 3260.18 speaker2  the vision of you.
3256.10 3271.78 speaker4  Also, this was before I started hiring smart people that works for my security company.
3268.62 3323.54 speaker2  has a picture of you hanging from the rear view mirror to remind them who they work for. I'd get delicious information from my boss not like tonight. You better go catch him. and press his boss. You see, you see there's the van. There seems to be like some rummaging about in the cleaning van that is parked right outside the front of this office building as you're walking over to meet the stretch escalate that is now meeting you in the parking lot.
3320.86 3337.46 speaker4  of the back of that van when the doors were open during the struggle?
3336.06 3347.22 speaker5  There's a lot of cleaning. A lot of sweeping up, a lot of mopping.
3346.38 3364.94 speaker4  at one point. I know that this isn't how car doors work, but I stick it in the, in the handle. So she can't get out of the back of the van.
3363.14 3370.10 speaker5  Oh, is that what the rummaging was?
3368.90 3396.90 speaker2  Gotcha, gotcha. and you've pulled up in such a way to where that she can't get out of the driver's side, which is the seat that she's kind of gotten herself into. And she's looking at you kind of horror, trying to figure out whether she should roll down the window or not.
3395.18 3406.94 speaker3  Have you any Grey Poupon? I always wanted to say that.
3406.10 3411.42 speaker5  Very good one.
3409.78 3413.10 speaker2  and holds it up to you.
3412.26 3449.58 speaker3  Is that poison? Don't, don't do it Dorothy. What's the pH? Cause I know a company like Trolley's, they don't do your normal messes. Do you want a taste of this arm around your neck one more time?
3448.62 3453.66 speaker2  Rolling it back up. Rolling it back up.
3452.50 3456.94 speaker5  Normal cleaning.
3455.86 3464.54 speaker2  It breaks down, starts crying. You guys can roll him it. Dorothy the kid's right.
3462.70 3465.38 speaker5  I failed a 19 on a 10.
3464.54 3468.66 speaker2  Damn.
3467.82 3485.58 speaker4  Damn, damn, damn. Damn, damn, damn, damn.
3484.10 3489.66 speaker5  I don't have your grapefruit pot. I just have it in me yard.
3488.50 3494.78 speaker3  Just a joke.
3492.94 3499.26 speaker5  Yeah.
3496.66 3507.74 speaker4  Should we go to the, the doc's house? That is also true. Good thinking.
3504.30 3514.26 speaker3  Plus this map we got with this space needle.
3512.70 3528.06 speaker5  within that area exactly. Perhaps we would find more there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
3525.82 3535.54 speaker2  here in the city, or at least Dr. Brock Hargrave seems to stay within his area around his house.
3533.38 3556.94 speaker5  with Aaron Strummer so I could give him a call while we're on our way to another site. All right, let's check out the house first
3556.10 3563.06 speaker2  don't get angry about it.
3561.38 3571.22 speaker4  Do you have any of these crystals you can maybe put your bad negative energy into before you give him a call?
3569.22 3591.86 speaker5  Oh, I always have them charging at least when the phase of the moon aligns, of course. I wouldn't charge a lapis lazuli on a waxing crescent, of course. and it is charged.
3589.54 3603.38 speaker4  Wait a minute, doc, has he ever met Craig?
3601.50 3608.06 speaker5  A career-defining performance, yes.
3606.02 3634.50 speaker4  It's gonna be tough, doc, but I know you can do it. You're a real artist with those things, no matter how much they get in the way on the missions. Hargrave's home. I see the Space Needle is kind of potentially an epic conclusion. Yeah.
3631.94 3662.30 speaker5  Then yeah, so that's on our way then. Arren, this is a friend of Mr. St. Blythe. He told me to call you.
3657.30 3672.82 speaker2  Mr. St. Blythe always calls me Arren. He's a bit of a, you know.
3671.70 3688.26 speaker5  Am I on the right track? Just keep going, just keep going. Thumbs up, all right.
3686.86 3702.58 speaker2  That's the one, yes. Arren Strummer's Resonating Crystals, though it doesn't say Arren, just says Strummer's Resonating Crystals above the door
3698.30 3710.98 speaker5  But you see, I'm a mutual friend there of Mr. St. Blythe and one Brock Hargrave.
3710.02 3739.50 speaker2  What was the name? I'm not supposed to say these kinds of things, No, no, I'm not seeing this name anywhere on my list.
3735.74 3755.66 speaker5  that of maybe great value or historical significance go missing lately? that sounds like something that, you know, St. Blythe would say, right? Oh, disguise.
3753.30 3778.06 speaker2  and the mercenary to roll criminology.
3776.22 3784.94 speaker5  I failed my criminology roll.
3783.30 3805.02 speaker2  the three of you that are in the room. And Becca, since you succeeded on your criminology check, this is knowledge that will just be for you. Wait, you're in the same room? They're all doing this thing where they put their fingers in their ears and then rub them around to make the consistent noise
3803.78 3816.50 speaker3  Excellent.
3812.38 3833.14 speaker2  that me hook would know Aaron Strummer, which is Aaron Strummer's brother. at the resonating crystal shop. He is a seller of crystal methamphetamine.
3831.50 3837.66 speaker3  I know, yeah, I know that guy.
3836.10 3845.30 speaker2  And this kind of comes to you
3840.30 3852.30 speaker3  Not for me, but many people at the hold
3847.30 3908.34 speaker2  So, who is this that I'm speaking to then? Yeah, are you sure this isn't some sort of crystalline knowledgeable man, some sort of client of mine? Let me remind you, it's like 9.45 p.m. now at night Hey y'all, who is this? Yes, Aaron, who called for me?
3906.10 3924.02 speaker5  It's, hang on.
3922.18 3948.86 speaker2  Immediately though, like, okay. You owe me a favor. Oh, okay, like I owe you a favor after the last time? Yeah, telling me that that little fish fella of yours isn't still hanging about? You're not still protecting him?
3946.22 3983.34 speaker3  Don't know anything about his whereabouts. But you know who is? A lot of your former clients. and they'll be back on the choo-choo train. You know what I mean? I wanna know what you know about Dr. Brock Hargrave, cause he had some questions for you. Questions like, can he get some more?
3980.98 3991.46 speaker2  He's trying to get some crystal. I don't know what you want. Why wouldn't he be?
3989.34 3994.90 speaker3  Yeah, no, I guess we are in the city.
3993.86 4002.14 speaker2  Should've known better.
3997.14 4011.22 speaker3  Why would it be any different for some hob-nosing jungle seeking cat piss smelling cowboy hat wearing guy?
4009.58 4027.22 speaker2  he's probably, you know, I don't know. Maybe that's why he hasn't made another order in a while. Trying to make his own. I don't know, like two weeks ago.
4025.74 4039.42 speaker3  Doesn't help me, man. Doesn't help me. I turn the camera around. This is everybody in our car, by the way,
4037.70 4062.02 speaker4  Hey, it sounds like you guys are still here. There's also a mob man whose name keeps changing. Nearly the whole time, but. It sounds like maybe you're selling drugs in my city.
4059.58 4063.86 speaker2  I think you want to talk to my brother, Oren, maybe.
4063.02 4080.82 speaker4  Yeah, but. And you sell crystal methamphetamine. and we're gonna have to have a separate conversation
4079.54 4086.14 speaker3  That seems fair.
4085.30 4091.90 speaker2  Good to know. I will be in touch. So you've been, what?
4090.46 4101.98 speaker4  Yeah, so what?
4097.82 4112.90 speaker3  that Meat Hook is in with some classy folks now.
4109.58 4123.82 speaker4  And if you keep selling, to our friend Meat Hook.
4122.62 4131.38 speaker2  I'm not gonna mess. In fact, I'll stop. I'll stop selling drugs.
4130.54 4148.26 speaker4  from each other. I'll call you later. You don't have to stop. You just gotta cut me in on it. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and we'll talk later. Does he like to do drugs up in a tall tower? Does he like to do drugs up in a tall,
4145.78 4180.50 speaker2  oh, you're talking about his, the zeitgeist? Yeah. He's got my children digging at the zeitgeist. I was like trying to maybe, you know, you know, and I happened to see what he was doing out there, doing some digging with his sharp shovel.
4178.62 4187.66 speaker4  Sharp shovel, doc, it sounds like him.
4186.82 4187.66 speaker2  Oh yeah, there's definitely a telescope in this tower. Is it just food?
