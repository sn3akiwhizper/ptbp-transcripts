0.00 229.52 speaker0  Hello, my talk show audience. It's your host with the most advice, Dr. Wolf the dog. I always believe in quantity over quality when it comes to talking people through their complex problems. The more words I say, the more likely you are to believe I know what the hell I'm even talking about. And I am chatting at you live from 694.2 PTBP as always. But not as always. We got a different type of episode today. Well, them boys from pretending to be people ain't seen each other in person in so long. But today I got a real sweet treat for y'all. Those five fine fellas use the internet to have a remote conversation with each other. During this talk, they attempted to answer every single question sent in from y'all. Our beautiful and charismatic listeners. I only have remote conversations with everyone. So I don't know what the big hubbub is over all this stuff. My voice reaches beyond the stars into other dimensions unknown. I ain't never had to shake no hands to get my point across. But I digress. So I can digest. We here at 694.2 PTBP are proud to present another Q&A for our next episode. Episode 74 if you're keeping track. However, this next one will be less focused on the players and more focused on the story and characters. Wolf knows the expanse of the webs in place from contention to the city, from the future to the past and all times in between. Let's try to take a more objective look at what has unfolded here on 694.2 PTBP So head on over to the subreddit at reddit.com slash r slash pretending to be people and find that Q&A thread to submit your questions. Understanding the nature of this being a closed game, we are going to shy away from secrets between players and focus more on details that have been glossed over or just plain forgotten. just that some of them were forgotten under the table and dragged away by an inquisitive kitty. Or time. Or it's just thick fluffy clouds of that good good that are merely fogging some memories. Either way, now's a good time to get loose, shake it out, maybe do some light stretching because this next tune, it'll give you the Pringles Tingles. You will pop. You will not stop. Boom. Hi, Zach.
229.04 254.56 speaker2  What up? Hello. I'm in my home and I'm wearing jorts. Jorts has been the go-to.
253.68 283.20 speaker1  Short shorts. How short are these short shorts? Five inch inseam, baby. I don't know what that means, but it sounds tight. Oh, under your dong. Yeah.
282.16 360.56 speaker2  The recording over the... Windy Wang. I don't have to side-eye any of you anymore. I can see you all in one place without really moving my eyes at all. Stop moving your eyes. I'm just doing it out of habit. Luke just sent a chat to the group in Zoom. It says, My friends, I've missed you terribly over the past few weeks. It doesn't say pee. It says pee. I knew what you meant. Yeah, we all remember the vibe. All right, bye. Bye. He just like doesn't come back for the rest of the time.
359.20 363.04 speaker1  He never said he was coming back.
361.44 378.48 speaker2  He just said he was going to go grab that stuff. You know where he's going.
375.44 389.04 speaker1  Oh, I hope Murphy talks at least once or twice. Oh, he might. Thomas is set up in the kitchen.
381.84 392.00 speaker2  I can see that because his life-size Ozzy Smith poster is right behind him.
389.04 401.60 speaker1  The one that Zach has an intimate relations with.
400.88 416.56 speaker2  Yeah, that's good. It's great.
416.16 420.24 speaker1  Thank you.
418.24 424.48 speaker2  There's definitely won't be the last one though.
423.92 430.48 speaker1  I do too.
429.52 447.60 speaker2  You guys have been watching. All the things. Yeah. I know everyone's talking about it. It's so crazy.
444.80 464.16 speaker1  Yeah, if you haven't watched it yet, you should watch it. Boy, howdy. It is so bizarre in a way that I was not even prepared for already knowing how bizarre it was.
463.20 496.32 speaker2  Oh, no. Yeah. Right. So I saw somebody on Facebook was posting about it and one of the comments was like, dude, you know I got married there, right? And then he posted a picture and said, Carol Baskins was our officiant. And it was a picture of them getting married. No way. Carol Baskins with the flower crown marrying them. Yeah, it was wild.
492.88 508.48 speaker1  Oh, Chip, I really wish I'd been here for the start of this conversation because
506.08 518.88 speaker2  She's the only good one in the whole fucking documentary. She killed her husband to save those tigers.
517.12 528.32 speaker1  Wait, is there hero worship of him? Oh, yeah, dude. I agree that that's disturbing to me too. He's a shithead. He's a horrible person. He's a terrible, terrible person.
525.36 545.04 speaker2  Watching that fucking wedding scene, I was like, dude, Danny McBride's whole career was just invalidated by Sorry, the funeral where he's seen.
541.36 558.08 speaker1  He's talking about the kid's balls right in front of his mom, Yeah.
554.00 577.28 speaker2  just so he could post on social media that she was there two months after he died. Oh, boy. Yeah, fuck that guy. I think she rubbed him down pretty good and that's sardine oil. Well, guys, we have a crazy amount of questions to get through.
576.08 587.28 speaker1  Let's talk about Tiger King. This is a Tiger King spoiler cast now. Exactly. We're talking Tyg. Let's do episode by episode.
584.08 606.80 speaker2  Honestly, if you can have it spoiled for you by now, that clearly means that you are not social distancing, you're not staying at home. if you haven't seen it at this point. Our first question comes from crush36 over on the subreddit.
604.48 617.68 speaker1  I think it's K. Ruse36. It's crush.
614.96 658.56 speaker2  He's a dude who started listening a while ago. He lives on the other side of the country and he is kicking ass modding the subreddit as well as co-modding the discord for pretending to be people. Very fun. Someone changed his name to crush316 in the Google doc. game you do right after reading this question and then immediately commented, oh fuck, never mind coronavirus. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Yeah, we can't do it live, but that's an easy one. Obviously me. Yeah. I was going to say Thomas.
658.40 673.60 speaker1  Yeah. I've seen Thomas's thumbs and they frightened me. I can pop it.
671.20 677.20 speaker2  I think, I think we'd be an interesting fight, Joe.
676.72 691.28 speaker1  I would. Okay.
689.44 768.72 speaker2  We got that one answered pretty quickly. Joe, give up. Uh, so, uh, Jayhawk asks, let's say your character gets a do over. What one thing would you change? And then in parentheses row, you can answer twice. If for some reason the player and the character would want to change different things. Bonus points of the GM can give an idea. Uh, if the GM can get an idea, if the Zach, uh, can give an idea of how things would be different from that point forward, which I acknowledge could be difficult for the sake of avoiding campaign spoilers or whatever. That makes sense. Let's start with, I've got an answer. Um, I saw this question earlier today and I realized like I had no, I hadn't ever even their notes and shit and we just kind of play it once a week. So I don't know. I have no idea what I would change. I'd have to really like what Thomas would change. I don't think anything. Cause that's kind of like antithetical to the, to play in the game. But John Lee Pettymore, uh, would definitely just have fucking booked it with his $5 million in Coke money and left town, left the state. He'd be on a beach somewhere.
766.64 769.60 speaker1  Like that's good. Yeah.
769.12 781.28 speaker2  Yeah. How long would you have been on that beach though? Before you realized maybe you weren't on a beach all along and you've been trapped. I don't know.
780.24 784.88 speaker1  He wouldn't fucking care.
783.04 804.24 speaker2  How long have we been cops in contention? And then back again, who's up next? I got one.
799.20 817.44 speaker1  But in this very last arc, I would have gone to a different place when I, when it was, when it was brought up both Joe and Clark, I think, think that. Sorry. Yeah. Not comp comfy. The one, the one at the, uh, the university, there was an opportunity for Clark to maybe
815.84 822.72 speaker2  go to city state university. Yeah. His name's Luke.
822.48 834.32 speaker1  No. Oh, that was high school.
833.28 860.64 speaker2  That was the contention. High school is the miners. It was the, uh, Edie guys. Venus flytraps? Venus flytraps? Perhaps. The Edie guys. Doesn't matter. Feed me Seymour. I call my dick the Venus flytrap. Wow. Why?
859.36 872.24 speaker1  Green and it eats flies.
867.28 888.00 speaker2  wheelchair aspect of it more, um, after he got shot in the foot. Yeah. Gone full Ray Gillette. Yeah. I would have changed that.
887.28 893.36 speaker1  You should have got one.
893.12 980.24 speaker2  Yeah. That didn't work out too well for you. those things. Oh, wow. Not as much as I know about 3d printers. uh, it's this little boat model, this adorable little boat that you print to like, and it it's for troubleshooting like your initial setup and it's really easy to tell based like it puts it through all the paces, does a bunch of the time. It's fun. No more screen sharing. Boom. So you can see some good benches here. Yeah. What is that? Yeah. Would Wolf the dog change anything?
978.08 1006.80 speaker1  I think he's perfect the way he is. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. There's there's not much to change about perfection, baby. All right. Yeah.
1004.32 1066.56 speaker2  would have canceled him after the first episode. But that's just like how you grow. And like, as the person who actually like is the only one who knows what's going on. Sometimes, you know, it's like a, it's, it's always like a thought in my mind of like, Oh, I could have changed that. if you guys had done the things that you had changed. Thomas, if you would have left with the money, I definitely would have had someone stop you, obviously. And perhaps imprison you likely. Oh yeah. Yeah. What's the opposite of capturing someone?
1066.24 1079.76 speaker1  Bounce.
1076.64 1121.84 speaker2  uh, then yes, a lot would have changed. The last arc might not have happened the way it happened. And, uh, I, I actually had completely other plans that I decided to change. Uh, so that, that entire past arc in 26 years ago at calm, comfy campground, was going to be something else. So, um, because Joe went to a different place. Yeah. Wow. Luke, uh, if you would have worked the wheelchair angle more, I would have made sure that Contingent had ramps. Yeah. I would just would have made sure that Contingent was like, uh, compliant.
1121.52 1123.60 speaker1  It is. It does.
1123.20 1185.60 speaker2  Oh yeah. Of course. Like all the businesses, they're super chill about that. game and went on to say, you're playing a group of police officers who are stumbling into mythos rather than a group of seasoned agents on a sanctioned DG mission or a mix of seasoned rookie agents or agents based on expertise agents in general, right? So really there's a broad scale in how much Delta green lore and specifics you use and how much you deviate and homebrew. And I'm curious how we ended up in contention PD as opposed to anything else that could have been, you know? a lot of Delta green scenarios? Exactly. And why are we playing in like a place we made up, I guess maybe in like a sandbox town instead of like a mission, like where you are sent somewhere?
1180.24 1213.44 speaker1  can't help with, but I remember you saying that the, the idea of the small town thing was always like really appealing to you. And we kind of all liked those stories being from the Midwest and having been to some very small towns in our lifetime where just like weird crap kind of happens all the time, but taking it to like the super extreme and how would a small town react to like the supernatural elements and stuff like is just, I think that's just fun. Yeah.
1209.44 1228.64 speaker2  And I've wanted to run a sandbox for a while, like right, right. And run a sandbox. So that definitely had some to do with it, but also we just like, I think we came together with that idea, right? Like it was already going to be a small town when we met for the session zero. I think so.
1227.20 1232.32 speaker1  And I don't know.
1231.44 1285.20 speaker2  Yeah, I agree. Delta green missions are great. They're just not really how we've played campaigns in the past. And we, so, Oh, that's something we can say that this is pretty much how we did two full like year long campaigns just around our table and kind of a little bit sandboxy. Not, we didn't have a whole made up town or anything, but sure. Yeah. It was basically just like, I would take pre-written adventures from either call of Cthulhu or Delta green. And then I would mess with them and then make little like connecting scenarios to play in between to kind of make the overall thread of whatever story we were telling connect to itself, spiderwebs and all that.
1280.24 1301.84 speaker1  learning and freaking out about things along with us that you maybe not, you maybe wouldn't get if our characters were so hardened that none of this was new to them. It's kind of fun that we're freaking out with weird shit in character and out. Agreed.
1300.32 1364.48 speaker2  from the actual Delta green. And then the ones that I make up and add, I love like sneaking that in slowly to a story of people who are relatively normal. So, you know, I'm obviously familiar with Lovecraftian themes, but I don't own a Delta green handbook or anything. Keep it that way. A small town like any other. Everyone on the threads are like, we don't play that one. It's not very well written.
1359.12 1408.16 speaker1  was like, so up to date with a lot of the Delta green lore, some weird monster of some kind was spawning somewhere and they were already like, Oh, I know what this thing is. But it was weird that their character would like, their character shouldn't know that. know this. I don't know. It's kind of more interesting to use the rule set, but then kind of be able to insert your own fiction within it. Yeah, totally. But their, their character was like just a small town, like park ranger or something.
1403.68 1516.24 speaker2  Which I just, I think it's way more fun to play normal people exposed to this than it is to. and has like one experience, but that's the interesting thing about a seasoned quote unquote Delta green agent means they've probably like been doing it for not that long and not been on very mission, very many missions, because if they had, they're probably loosey goosey or a deady wetty. wetty. It says, if you each had to give one bit of advice to someone, what would it be? Don't listen to me. First off, I just want to say, yeah, none of us are in any position to give any advice. I think I am. No, just be patient with everyone you meet. Try to be, if they don't, if they do things that seem irrational or not understandable to you, just know they're probably coming from a really different place. And yeah, just don't be a Dick. Mark. stop interrupting me.
1515.28 1522.24 speaker1  That's what I'm saying. Justin, this is a year. He's mean.
1520.80 1533.52 speaker2  Hey, do you see what's happened? It's worth it to break free of your oppressive.
1532.88 1573.36 speaker1  My advice. This is something I said in, in the discord is, uh, is nevermind. I forgot. He realized that he probably shouldn't say it. Yeah. It's not cool. Cause he doesn't. Oh my God. Like I was ready to be enlightened. Luke. Yup. It helps. Nice.
1572.40 1602.16 speaker2  Mine's Mark. Shout out to Mark. Oh, nice. Thomas's stepdad is Luke's therapist. My advice. Oh fuck. Am I going to Justin it? I remembered mine. Perfect timing.
1601.44 1649.52 speaker1  Yes. Okay. So mine is a, it's kind of like a mindfulness based thing, which is, uh, take control of what you can and what you can control, make plans of action, begrudgingly accept what you can't control and move on and be kind like Thomas said. Everyone like, just be kind to each other, no matter what the haps are. Unless someone's being a real big piece of shit, then you can be a dick to them. on in their life. Like we do know what's going on with Zach. He's just mean and malicious.
1647.04 1659.36 speaker2  Like you got it from a grandpa or something. They definitely nurtured you, right? Oh, my grandpa's a dick. Yeah. Like you.
1657.60 1661.20 speaker1  It's good to see you guys. Yeah.
1659.60 1727.44 speaker2  It's really good to hang out again. But yeah, I want to amend my answer. Don't be be patient with everyone except for Zach. My advice is to, uh, to ask questions. Good one. Like, what did you touch? attractive position, but that's just because I looked in the mirror all the time and they say, the more you see something, the more attractive you it's just a, like when someone like talks about a band and asks if you've heard of them and you like have heard of them, but you haven't listened to them, like, just ask, I don't know, like, don't act like you know everything.
1725.68 1728.72 speaker1  So that's, that's wrong.
1727.44 1739.92 speaker2  That's wrong listeners. You should, you should be like, oh yeah, I've heard of them. I've heard of them. I prefer their earlier stuff. Just like ask people questions and learn more. Nice.
1739.44 1752.88 speaker1  I like that. Good advice. shut up. Front it till you crown it.
1752.16 1754.16 speaker2  That was good. I liked it.
1753.44 1787.44 speaker1  Joe. Hey Joe. Yeah. Hey Joe. Hi. Give us some really good advice and don't embarrass yourself. Like Zach just did. Fin for yourself. Figure it out for number one. It's Joe Terry.
1783.20 1816.64 speaker2  We got it on Twitter and it's from at crane song. And it says, if contention had continued to be boring and normal and the boys had just kept on their normal person trajectory, what would their future have looked like? Would they marry, have kids retire early? And then they also, they said, I humbly offer unto you this blep. And they had a nice picture of the cat with a little blep and that was very nice. Cute cat.
1810.24 1835.36 speaker1  Clark would definitely still be at the station and he would be eternally waiting for Maggie to vacate her position position so that he could take over. But I foresee it being like a Prince Charles thing that he, she would be there forever and he would grow old and probably never get his goal. That sounds right.
1832.40 1896.00 speaker2  That might be sadder than what actually happens to Clark Bishop. criminality he got up to in the podcast or he would have really gone hard on the cop thing, gotten into some pretty questionable Facebook groups. Oh God. Yeah. It's not a, it's not a bright, uh, it doesn't look good. Let's hope John Lee Pettymore stays the path. her? I go to the parts of the internet that make fun of that part of the internet. There you go.
1893.28 1905.76 speaker1  is he a little more like, I'm a one woman kind of guy, man?
1898.56 1939.84 speaker2  I think, I think he, uh, I met a guy once who was, um, extremely just like Missouri in a lot of ways, this electrician. And we were talking when I was like 23 and he was like, so you're not going to get like married or have kids anytime soon. And I was like, yeah, I never, uh, I never really wanted kids. And he like stopped and he was like, Oh, huh. He's just like, yeah, it's what you do, right? Like, sure. What's Keith's story?
1936.72 1940.96 speaker1  Keith, uh, works there for about a year.
1939.84 1976.88 speaker2  Gets fired. Um, can't, uh, hold down a job eventually becomes homeless until his brother finally takes pity on him. Um, lets him live at his house. kills his brother at some point. and then you accidentally shot him in the head.
1973.44 2001.52 speaker1  I think that's like what happened to John F. Kennedy.
1995.52 2011.52 speaker2  So yeah, Keith, Keith is, uh, probably better, better off with the shit going down now. Drew Andrews, I think would eventually. Okay. First of all, no one asked Zach.
2010.48 2014.80 speaker1  That's another question. Tell us about Drew.
2014.08 2017.52 speaker2  I'm just being a dick.
2016.32 2020.24 speaker1  No, you're right.
2019.12 2023.44 speaker2  Yeah, not now.
2022.88 2028.88 speaker1  I'm sorry.
2027.36 2041.36 speaker2  Guys, I feel so bad. This is Drew speaking.
2040.64 2042.48 speaker1  I love Drew.
2041.92 2144.16 speaker2  He's dead. We got another question here. That dude, no one knows says, is there a PO box? We can send you beer. We'll be setting one up shortly. Yeah, just because you said that. Hey, shut the fuck up. When are you coming out with merch? Cause I need that shit. That is also very soon. We've got some really cool shit lined up and I'm very excited for you all to see it. Every size of cock ring. The colostomy bags with, with the logo on them. Pet caskets. Yeah, I know. pre-ordered a pet casket. Which is most of you. What do I do now? Dot com. Thankfully we were able to get that. I'm really excited about it. What is your favorite system for quick one shot slash introducing people to RP? I mean just right off the bat, Delta green, Delta green, and it's the best one. And it's, I think the best way to introduce people to role playing. It's super easy to play. Super intriguing. I fucking love it. I agree. And the one shots are just always a fucking blast and you can get them done in three or four hours usually. Yeah. What about you, Justin?
2139.92 2222.96 speaker1  Uh, don't do what I did, which is try and learn an entire new system you've never played and then try and run brand new people through it while you're also learning it. Cause I tried that with dungeon world and it became a mess. Even though dungeon world seems super dope, having all new people with like a more complex system than like others, like the dice rolling mechanic was really easy, but like all the other character building and other stuff was what is dungeon world. but the crux of it is like most roles are accomplished with two D six if I remember right. And a third of them are you get to do what you want. And then the other third are like you fail, which I thought was really cool, but it can be a little confusing. I think Delta green is really good for most people to start on. It's just percentages. So you can kind of role play that a little easier. I think Delta green's like awesome. I'm about to probably run some friends through it. And I was like, this seems like the way to go. Yeah.
2219.20 2224.80 speaker2  the mechanics get in the way as little as possible. Exactly.
2223.52 2238.72 speaker1  That's my thing too. Dude, you fucking got me.
2238.24 2245.84 speaker2  I'm real. COVID caddy. I'm real. I'm real quarantine caddy tonight.
2244.64 2254.64 speaker1  Quarantine caddy.
2252.08 2314.88 speaker2  be as successful as his paramedic cousin? He was always there for me. He was actually, yeah, he's fantastic. I made $5 million with that motherfucker. That's not an issue. That's me. That's like, that sounds familiar. What's in my pocket? Oh, it's a ring. I've read that book. Yeah, it's pretty good. and Luke. What's in your pocket right now? Let's see wallet. I'm calling wallet.
2314.56 2319.36 speaker1  Fuck.
2318.24 2349.12 speaker2  That would have been really easy. So I just do it.
2347.20 2370.64 speaker1  If you're a pervert like me and Luca. Oh, okay. Yeah. Dude, that. Okay.
2369.44 2374.72 speaker2  This is in there too. And it's holding up his driver's license.
2374.16 2376.80 speaker1  Put it on there. Audio.
2375.44 2439.28 speaker2  Audio medium. sneezing and an orgasm. And it's like my brain can. Obviously it can. an orgasm. And so if you sneeze twice, you'd be like, oh, a quarter of an orgasm. You completed. Yeah. That's different. Oh God. Can you imagine? is like taking a really long, satisfying piss. Ooh. What about just, all right. You got another question here.
2439.12 2441.28 speaker3  Yeah.
2439.28 2503.68 speaker2  If you push your pants twice, you're halfway there. I'm living on a prayer. Okay. So here's the thing I really fucked up because Alan Grimes was originally based on Walter Cronkite and Walter Mathau. But then like, as Thomas pointed out, definitely turned into, um, Nixon and Nixon and Mathau. Yeah. Walter. Yeah. That was a silly, silly call on my end. I liked this one a lot. Each person name and describe their favorite tourist attraction in or around Springfield, Missouri difficulty level. You may not give the same answer as someone else.
2501.60 2524.48 speaker1  Cause I think it's legitimately awesome. The new aquarium in town is legitimately world-class. It's uh, it's the best pro guy. Johnny Morris. Still haven't been. I've been twice. It's really cool. Go to the aquarium. Don't go to the other part.
2524.08 2594.00 speaker2  Yeah. It's just like, look who all these like rich fucks have shot. Yeah. eating nephews, like next to dead rhinos and shit. And it's like, what the fuck? Yeah. It's really, it's really creepy. But the aquarium is great. but you should go to Casper's. It's this cool old, uh, burger joint in a, uh, in an authentic old Quonset hut. That's a cool part of like Springfield LGBT history. And they have dope burgers. Wait, I didn't know it was, uh, I didn't know it was an ally. or even a little later. Oh, that's sick. Me and my dad used to go there for lunch every week and get Frito pie.
2592.08 2597.60 speaker3  The chili there was dope.
2594.00 2608.48 speaker2  I do like how they serve the chili in the bowls where it's like totally overflowing. Yes.
2606.16 2654.16 speaker1  Try some cashew chicken when you come here. Yeah. Yeah, we invented it. Motherfuckers. It's really good. If you just want some weird fried chicken breast or thigh or whatever battered and with just like a salty soy sauce over it, it's decadent and delicious. get what we're talking about. Hers is very specific to Springfield and it's, yeah, it's like fried chicken and gravy. It's great. good version of it, which is kind of fun. For $4.50. Yeah. $4.50, a little side of rice and an egg roll. But there's really good places too if you want to actually get a little more. It's on the end that had the $4.50 forever.
2653.60 2659.36 speaker2  Yeah. What's your go-to Chinese place? I drove by the other day and they're like $5, $5.50 now. What the fuck?
2658.88 2663.52 speaker3  I know. Damn it.
2661.20 2784.96 speaker2  What's your go-to Chinese in Springfield? it is exotic animal paradise. Oh yeah, dude. Well, which hasn't been called that for years, right? And is it even still open? I don't think so. Wait, is that the one where you drive through? I think it's called Wild Animal Safari. The reason that it's my favorite, besides the animal abuse, is on a real note, it is probably some fucked up shit going on. But when I was a kid, I went there a lot and I have a lot of really good memories with my grandpa who passed away, who is the only grandparent who passed away when I was younger and therefore holds a really nice memory in my heart because I didn't get to find out that he was probably racist. And so all my memories of him are pure and he would always bring leather gloves with him so that he could unroll the window and pet the ostriches who would then peck at his hands and grab onto his gloves. And it was very fun. One of my favorite memories growing up was driving through there and him rolling the window all the way down and leaning the seat back in a buffalo put its entire head inside the minivan and started licking the ceiling and my grandma was just like freaking out. so I can't, I don't know if the new owners are like Joe Exotic bad or not. They do have two tigers. Back in the day it was not like Joe Exotic's weird fucking zoo.
2782.96 2787.44 speaker1  And the peacocks running around.
2786.88 2831.60 speaker2  Hold on. Hold on Luke. Fantastic Caverns is pretty cool. Oh hell yeah. Silver Dollar City, not really Springfield but close enough. It's so dope. Food is great and you gotta ride the rides. Are you a roller coaster guy? You gotta ride the rides or they won't let you eat the food. As a goof. As a good goof. We went there, Zach and I and our and our partners went there last year on acid and had a really fun time watching the old-fashioned glass blowers.
2830.88 2834.96 speaker3  It was really chill.
2832.56 2901.36 speaker2  I still have a knife that I bought when I was a kid. Like a pocket knife that was made there. a carnival ride does but then it also goes on a roller coaster track so you're going spinning around while you're going upside down and doing corkscrews. Which is my favorite. Yeah I think that's really fair. It was scary. Did everybody say their favorite stuff? Do we really? remember. If you can pee.
2898.96 2904.08 speaker1  We're gonna we're gonna need to wrap this up because my parents said no.
2902.00 2921.52 speaker3  We have to watch they have to watch me do it.
2920.96 2926.80 speaker2  No one talk.
2924.96 2957.76 speaker1  Is this it's pee break time it sounds like. Sounds like it. Two fancy boys. Your beard looks incredible. Thank you. It's doing pretty well. I'm loving it. I went I went the opposite direction where I was like I need to change something about my life and I have control over my hair.
2957.28 2966.88 speaker2  Thank you.
2962.48 2983.84 speaker1  was like she's like you look like you're 18 again and it's weirding me. It's like I'll take that as a compliment being a 30 year old boy.
2978.96 3038.88 speaker2  but I do still have like weird baby face so it's like man baby. Oh I'm so jealous. It's super fun. My cousin actually bought it like gifted it for me. Oh wow that's awesome. Which was super nice. Yeah I just woke up and like got on my computer and was like your dope ass cousin has sent you a gift. Oh that's awesome. Because she bought her brother like the DLC for it the new DLC and she's like you guys should play multiplayer together which we haven't I've just we've both racked up like and the setting is really cool like ancient China.
3034.08 3062.56 speaker1  Yeah I love that whole setting I used to play all the Dynasty Warriors games just because I love that like the idea of that setting yeah and then realizing it was like actually a thing makes it even more interesting it makes me want to play the Total War stuff because I feel like they're a little more historical while still making the heroes more hero like but it's more a little grounded in a lot of other aspects.
3062.08 3098.72 speaker2  what they call it. Oh interesting. So romance is based more on just like the novels the romance of the three kingdoms yeah Total War games. Yes yeah which are fantastical abilities and stuff and and and that your generals are just
3093.84 3129.20 speaker1  that's that that one's on my list for sure once it goes like just enough on sale it's going to be one of those ones I just like instant buy and probably put like way too many hours into.
3122.48 3246.24 speaker2  what we want it to be we'll probably come up with two or three ideas and let the patreons decide the patrons decide in a poll what the next goal will be so if your patron look out for that that'll be coming up shortly you will figure it out. They also asked for the players how much time do you each spend thinking about this campaign DM and like invested listeners to hear but I'm totally just here for the ride I'm have like it's really fun to experience the mystery like washing over you yeah if we think about it too
3241.52 3310.48 speaker1  I think about like what moments could possibly come up or like what would have been cool for another moment and also wolf wolf the dog in it every week obviously I'm like always kind of caught up on what's going on and then being in the show even it was like it's so it's so many like if I haven't been thinking about it at some point within the week I will start thinking about it
3302.48 3401.92 speaker2  campaign I would go to the public library so I didn't get distracted and I would sit down at a before the podcast started essentially so I wrote all that out almost like a short story first and then I created NPCs out of that and then for week to week I do I actually like I write the campaign week to week now because I have no idea how their actions are gonna affect what we do next so I try
3398.08 3433.60 speaker3  and the guy running it is not me so I'm helping him out a little bit but it's fun it's called we're calling it the moldy worm campaign
3427.20 3594.08 speaker1  um I am actually haven't been playing any others but as I've vocalized a couple times here I've been wanting to to dip in a little bit with running some stuff and I think I'm going to try I didn't realize the core rule book of delta green and the one of the missions is free online it's of running some of my friends through that since uh we were kind of talking about doing it anyway and a great social distancing thing is a role playing online so I think that's going to be a big thing for me because I was like man I really would like to do this and it's fairly simple to set up stuff online especially delta green you don't need a board or anything
3589.60 3667.28 speaker2  Pollock came on he was showing off his bit of like one word impersonations he's like can you find one word that gets to the uh like absolute essence of the person you're trying to uh impersonate sure and for Liam Neeson it was banana yeah well that'll happen fun I've been thinking about it for like five years gorilla's consent make the meat vegan or are you more worried that the gorilla might have
3661.68 3722.24 speaker3  it all right so we already talked about the guy who made tacos out of his foot yeah we did yeah
3718.72 3818.56 speaker2  that joke wasn't bad it was jane goodall oh my god yeah when they bust out the walmart truck oh my god it's so fucking sad all right uh we got uh damn guardian uh dom guardian on reddit asks so joe faved one of my tweets casting the pt bp tv series good stuff which led me to click on his twitter profile which leads me to the following question joe why the fuck does obama follow you earlier today because i'd never seen that the verified accounts of both barack obama
3813.52 3893.44 speaker1  him i i haven't checked but that's i think he's probably got a million follows also joe's just huge crush on britney spears so maybe she sensed that through the net and was like follow her that's probably where the accounts crossed paths but no i don't know why she's
3886.64 3936.80 speaker2  britney spears and barack obama they've been looking at him they've seen some dog shit i don't know man those both seem like very uh kind-hearted celebrities to follow yeah question from jay saki he says now that dennis detwiller has released an entire absolutely amazing campaign around the king in yellow called impossible landscapes which starts this with the scenario night floors will you get ross paton to run y'all through the whole thing pretty please
3929.12 3991.68 speaker1  i'm just really combative the entire time with yeah i think that's a good i'd like that i won't think that's such a cool weird scenario uh yeah i would love to love to do more of it that would be
3985.52 4224.80 speaker2  realm of possibility if we hit a goal that was high enough to run a second campaign on the patreon did they ever finish the road construction work around zach's house parentheses yes we saw you on in front of my house it was uh i got a letter that said it would be done november of 2019 underscore damanche colonel oh that's my bad tylenol i showed taylor clue last night she'd uh so maybe he is more successful than what was his uh cousin's name emmit yeah yeah the emt lead us into a few questions in a row about media uh so get ready uh what's everyone's favorite
4220.80 4286.88 speaker1  and i still rank it up there as one of my favorite horror movies of all time i think it's
4279.60 4297.60 speaker2  joseph he's really good and seth rogan and anthony mackie no it is it's really delicious uh justin
4291.44 4389.04 speaker1  lot of horror movies even though i'm always super interested in them uh i have trouble with the the expectation of jump scares taking all the enjoyment out for me just like being like way and then i just like yeah i have a lot of trouble actually getting to just sit there and like get myself into it i think uh but best like horror like adjacent thing the hannibal tv show is things though too where i i really liked it like thinking about it but watching it i just was like always waiting for a jump scare and because of that i feel like it's harder for me to actually just enjoy it for whatever reason if that makes any sense it's just like i'm waiting for that
4383.84 4469.04 speaker2  horror picture luke one night we were hanging out and he was like have you seen drag me to hell and i was like oh that one is really had a blast it was so fun uh it's like my favorite is the shining like i i don't think i've seen anything that rivals that experience for me because i saw a little too early and so it it's on like sixth or seventh grade and it it left a real mark and i never thought about them being scary and like wounded and then i was convinced i was just gonna see like a bloody fucking ghost like right i was like dude my mom is gonna be uh the bathroom a few months when i would just like weigh if i really needed to go when i was in the second
4462.40 4533.68 speaker1  freaked me the fuck out to like crying hysterics and we were trying to watch uh the faculty and john stewart in that movie gets all of his fingers cut off at one point and i ran screaming
4527.68 4641.76 speaker2  like it's a thriller i guess technically oh it's pretty thrillers are definitely my like jam more everyone what is your favorite piece of lovecraftian media books movies comics etc or is playing tabletops your main slash only exposure to the genre thomas can you please lovecraft but it's from like the 1890s or something uh the willows 1907 uh by algernon going down um the daniel river like on a canoe trip anyway it's it's just really it's it was really influential for like the the tone of a lot of the things we all enjoy so that's my that's my out of left field answer i don't remember if it really went anywhere i remember kind of being dissatisfied in the ending maybe but i i did enjoy the ride and it's just like it's got atmosphere
4637.52 4694.00 speaker1  answer my answer actually so i haven't read a whole lot of lovecraft i think i've read maybe three or four of the short stories uh but one of my favorite pieces of media is called the the ballad of black tom and it's one of his stories it's the uh horror at red hook from the viewpoint
4688.80 4781.68 speaker2  unnatural horrors that it introduces and you'd understand you'd have more context to say the yellow wallpaper which i just recently brought up during one of the integral scenes of the last episode of this last arc and what's cool uh for me like that story means a lot to me personally uh because i once went insane and was trapped inside a room that my husband had locked since that short story ever since i read it for the first time when i was in sixth grade and then i studied english in college the first time and i read it in two other classes actually and it brought it back for me and then uh turns out that the girl i was dating who then uh was also named taylor and is also my wife now uh she uh that is actually her favorite short story and so she teaches it in her english classes i think she finds a way to push it in there and so it's
4775.68 4827.44 speaker3  but i've seen some like movies based on his stuff um when i was a kid i didn't realize it was lovecraft but i saw um from beyond it's like a 80s like kind of b movie uh but it was scary when i was a kid and i remember it being good and then i recently watched color out of space with nick game on the switch which was fun but took me like five hours to beat so not really worth the price
4822.08 4882.24 speaker1  like the weird true detective season one shit where they talk about carcosa and the yellow king and it's like kind of in the weird background and shit that actually was like one of the first times i was like oh what is all like what's the yellow king what's this what's carco like i don't i didn't really know anything before watching that and it added this weird like supernatural tinge to uh what is more kind of grounded in reality and all the cultists and stuff like so oh shit i'm gonna rewatch that yeah i've been thinking about it a lot lately for some reason lovecraft stuff i've actually been meaning to read the willows also that's on my list so when thomas brought that up i was like oh someone i know actually has read this i added a bunch
4878.32 4909.68 speaker2  was i haven't done it in a few years but for a while i was really in the habit of reading like our no sleep stories before bed and stuff interesting i've been doing that they're perfect for it because they're like they're short they're spooky and engaging the only problem is it's it just gets so hard to like find an actually good one for sure and i feel like the writer base
4905.12 4919.76 speaker3  night i hadn't been to no sleep in a long time but i just went to top of the year and started
4914.08 5135.12 speaker1  like horror movies specifically it's like prepping for that jump scare is like too much for me sometimes for whatever reason i don't know if it's because i know video editing and camera work and other stuff and kind of like the technical details of how they're prepping to do certain things and horror stuff sometimes it's like oh they're probably going to do a jump scare and then i get like more psyched out instead of like just kind of like soaking in the the ambiance or read scary stories or like a comic book or other stuff i really enjoy that and so i think i'm going to start diving more because i love like the story of horror it's just the way so many horror movies are shot is so jump scare heavy or you're even if it's not jump scare heavy i've been like my mind is expecting it constantly so it like takes it it takes me out of it instead of like i was like i guess i'll hang out and watch it with you guys or whatever and it's like one of those things where it's like oh there's going to be a jump scare here and almost every time there is but it's still like it's because they always put like a stinger with audio and the other stuff it always gets me because it'd be the same as like if someone just yelled at you randomly out of nowhere in your everyday life you'd be like it's just like that sound and the way it's usually cut and edited it always like it always works on me like it's really hard to get a good one a good jump scare yeah i think they have their place for sure had my absolute favorite but that jump scare was it's an all-time for me it's so well done is it more of a slow burn kind one of my favorite ones ever yeah it's so well done it made my soul fly out of my body in such take a few episodes i agree and but then it became one of my favorite it's like a really like actually like a well-acted there's also one episode that's all one take and it's really well it's there's trickery involved but it's the episode i mean they don't cut for the whole mdb trivia that like that one of their longest not actually it's super long cuts yeah it's super duper long they they did a whole thing where because that the whole show takes place between two time periods and they they did a camera transition between sets to do the time change there's a whole behind the scenes of that episode that's so so freaking cool well and that
5127.92 5350.32 speaker2  jonas convolt from dark oh yeah i i would never say sure but i've never seen it i know i i didn't think uh either of you had um it's actually it's pretty good it would be a good quarantine watch i've heard nothing but good things about that show but the first time that i put it on i was funny language to to read the subtitles of and then like hear it because the subtitles will be like are you all right and they're like das ist in ordinung uh yeah no i will watch that i'm excited to watch it and then i'll steal all the so deeply to reveal all of his chest hair and both of his nipples which he is rubbing vigorously like a porn campsite if i just went on like with my two kittens
5345.52 5393.04 speaker1  wolf the dogs would be phantom of the opera because he likes how that guy lurks around
5386.72 5413.92 speaker2  recommendations do y'all have for the fine folks in the contention book club uh right now i'm reading the plague by kamu because it seemed thematically appropriate and it's good i think
5405.68 5481.92 speaker1  why buddhism is true by a behavioral psychology anthropologist that's really cool as i am on my mindfulness bullshit basically talking about how like the teachings of buddhism are like actually still ringing true in modern psychology and how they apply to humans as we have evolved from living in villages and stuff but we still like freak out over the same things that we've always freaked out over because our brains aren't that much evolved from those past times it is a very cool book and he's very funny that's he's very funny otherwise it would not be fun to read find something to like in it uh and then also the next question is from uh the modest light who brings up uh john dies at the end which is uh i love that book too and a fan of this podcast
5476.96 5553.76 speaker2  uh but it was really entertaining it's a really quick read and it like really helped put that reading habit back into my life and it became a lot easier after like having a book that i could just that was like a page turner that i could just scorch through to like make time to read each day now that's awesome so so did living in quarantine uh real quick to give a suggestion for a book uh for the contention book club would just be uh Dianetics the modern science of
5548.48 5579.44 speaker1  is is verbatim from the book and then it goes really wild at the end i wonder if they ran out of budget or something it it really screws with the story and it leaves out a huge chunk that's like a whole like arc in the book it's it's really wild how crazy that movie went i'm really glad
5572.48 5613.04 speaker3  book but i should so far in quarantine i went back and read uh cat's cradle again i anything Vonnegut is always good yes read breakfast of champions and then i read uh the time machine by hg wells it's really short and fun and then i've been reading a lot of Cormac McCarthy books so i read uh shit i forgot the name of one of them uh child of god was interesting it's pretty short too
5607.44 5678.88 speaker2  like uh douglas adams i think that's probably i haven't read john dies at the end but i'm guessing that my favorite book by him uh which is dirk gently's holistic detective agency crazy tv series uh i don't know if you guys saw my list it's on hulu right now what is it
5673.92 5685.04 speaker1  baby but but without without completely killing the possibility of the future you want to give
5678.88 5852.32 speaker2  it a smooch you have to look forward to it with a gentle smooch but yeah sometimes a kiss can lead i've got some great news uh i mentioned last week's uh on last week's episode that my dad uh went in and got tested for covid and his test came back negative them both and super happy that they don't hopefully have it because it could be a false negative but especially depending on where they came from like some of them fail up to like 30% of the time so yeah but your mom's fine probably denny denny is amazing maybe one of the best people when my statements are supposed to be questions um just so forceful we got a question from at snuggles mcsquigg nice does each cast member have a favorite character they'd created for a past campaign they wish they could bring into a new one oh yeah
5845.12 5872.56 speaker3  for a cult uh i think i got kicked out of it you did get kicked out of it uh i don't remember how
5866.16 5929.28 speaker2  that fetish uh just ran with it he stood up and he said okay i'm gonna play this out i'll be right back and he walked out of the room and we all sat there and then he walked back in and he set up a chair as the toilet which is like he got this fetish from like finding a clue inside a toilet bunch of the brood worm yeah like yeah like came out of the the the fecal matter as well and so entire scene of pulling out and all the facial expressions to come with it and that's when i knew
5923.60 6096.72 speaker1  have three actually from like three really different i'm fucking sorry joe but if you saddam hussein and he was a curt he was a curtish rebel he was really fun to play as because he had a bunch of like weird skills and was like kind of a weird character to be with all those other campaigns where i first got introduced to role-playing i had a weird minotaur blacksmith character who had a big hammer and one of my other friends was a dragon person or whatever combo attack where he would heat up my hammer as though i was gonna do some sick ass blacksmith just like hitting people with this huge hammer that's almost like melted while like suplexing
6090.40 6109.84 speaker2  patreon episode as agent wolf yeah it's one of my favorite characters that we've had on the show
6105.76 6146.00 speaker1  clark is definitely my favorite character i've ever played but i also really liked the first time i ever played with you guys i had a character named stacy bloom and he was a wide-eyed new kid on in law enforcement let alone delta green so i it was i was able to play my own real reactions to feeling you guys out about how to play this new game i've never played before i could do it through the guys of this wide-eyed new character
6139.84 6466.56 speaker2  other players had just run through last things last into the shotgun scenario metamorphosis so uh last things last is the one we were talking about earlier and then metamorphosis is a shotgun scenario for delta green and those two pair very very well and then joe came in and they were all explaining what happened uh in the last session and his eyes were fucking massive joe that john lee pettymore is probably the favorite my favorite character i've ever played named aladdin sane uh who was like a legitimate pop star and uh in the world so i got to like make so i was talking about like the profits from my from my numerous christmas albums and i brought character and the only game of pathfinder i played uh for like two or three sessions before i bailed because we started making this podcast and i didn't have time for literally anything else down river so uh yeah the other one was uh i really liked the delta green shotgun scenario burner uh that ross paton wrote uh i played a brolo named brody and uh there was a fun scene in that one where i got to um uh you know make a bunch of molotov cocktails and bust open the doors of a saloon while blasting eye of the tiger and i had taken like the grime from the floor of the bar and like rubbed it underneath my eyes to to become a warrior and then i died that uh that is still one of the most fun uh sessions i've ever played in and your actions in it like opened up the insane possibilities of role-playing for me i'd never played delta green and you were like so confident as like you're we we played all these people who came together when like shit hits the fan at this strip mall and i think you were just like the teenager who worked at a cell phone store right yeah and you were just like really confidently like playing with note that was like all right narrate your cool scene of you like coming out of the bar with all your molotovs and um yeah molotovs didn't help uh the shotgun that i didn't have ammo for didn't all right cool uh so they actually had another question snuggles mcsquig asked are there any other systems anyone is interested in trying something like never going home which is a world
6461.36 6624.40 speaker1  little bit better i have the book the book is also very cool and fun to read i've been really wanting to get into uh like super stripped down rpg stuff uh sam actually ran us that weird like homebrew thing where it was like the most stripped down ever i'd like to go like a couple steps above uh people said it's a really good introductory way to do role-playing stuff uh just in case can kind of apply it to whatever stuff you want it to be which sounds really interesting to me i kind of like that like zach said i kind of what can i do that like i want to do like cooperative storytelling more than like gameplay functionality it's like we can play a video game together if we really want to get down into that stuff but i'd rather have like the just a a loose set of rules apparently it's super cool because you have like your character but also you have like ship traits that when you're on the ship like you have maneuver it and stuff it looks super cool that's
6621.20 6867.68 speaker2  play set for fiasco based on tiger king of rules and everything so that'd be fun very fun uh we've got another question here from dazed underscore wanderer asks one what the fuck zach spelled my name wrong so q a that is a plot q a where we can talk about like things that the characters have learned and connecting some of those dots together let's give the people what they want more q a's to um head into the next arc of this story uh so we will answer that question on that episode number three how's ropo they still on that grind to lose weight they are i feed them less than you're supposed to you're the correct amount for a diet and then they they chase each other around your yoga mats out of the closet and put them in the living room but then never fucking do shit family of game systems rude dg csc pulp trail etc what would it be and why is it red markets is really into it which would make sense because it's written by caleb stokes who lives around here and is on rpr rppr a fair amount and wrote a really he also wrote a really dope campaign called god's teeth that he ran on rppr that is being published currently are being worked on to be published by delta green currently and yeah red markets is basically a survival game where you are in a zombied world but then your supplies run low and you have to go out on missions and like the more intense the mission is the better like rewards are available on that you
6861.04 6912.00 speaker3  know and basically you're trying to survive and make a world for yourself so the description is
6903.84 7120.56 speaker2  published he will so that's fucking sick uh maybe he'll ride run some red markets for us before then seeing as how he's the dude who wrote it i've seen him stream shit i bet he can do it remotely the people on the subreddit have a much stronger grasp of the campaign than us so got another question here from gwen egr and they ask how do you like to transition between campaigns do you prefer to build off an old thread or create something brand new create something brand new every time i think that especially in delta green most of the games i think all the campaigns that we've played in end with at least some sort of impact that would leave the globe reeling and therefore if we were to start another campaign in that same world the impact of the cancer trying to cure her and fucking up the spell and killing her and he had to at the end of that campaign and stared joe's character right in the eyes we blinked at each
7119.36 7134.16 speaker1  but i think you're so cute
7128.64 7204.40 speaker2  outdone yourself here if you were stranded on a dessert island what kind of sentient chase them around like directly toward the vanilla ice cream fountain or something like
7197.36 7291.76 speaker1  cookies but his body is like a hershey's chocolate turtle body but his shell is a big chocolate chip cookie yeah i get you cut him i can like split him right down the half in front of his turtle
7289.76 7321.12 speaker3  i would force him to make me custard
7312.64 7371.52 speaker1  to suck the custard out of zach's weird chocolate moose moose out of his bunghole i was thinking is i think that in one of the early episodes you said that he has a magnificent ass he's got a
7364.32 7511.36 speaker2  was a live action movie or show we are going to take our time with that question on the next uh how much the story writing process is influenced by slash influences the song you've chosen for the intros do you typically find that music influences you're writing a lot yes it absolutely does i remember specifically writing the plot for the silver spheres when i realized that john lee pettymore was the only one who had picked it up and then he put it in his pocket and i said okay well those balls have to do something weird and then i was like okay well why is john lee pettymore allowed to touch it if no one else is and no backbone was a part of that like when i was coming up with like the idea for that i was like oh shit this is this is yeah i find the lyrics like extremely important especially like uh moon dance i knew i knew what i was looking for plot wise uh for that arc before i got the song picked out but uh when that song happened when i came across it i was like oh yes of course this is absolutely perfect and then the next one this most recent one where we had dream girl uh that actually influenced the plot as well once i decided on that one uh that actually probably helped change joe's entire plot uh for that the line uh i swear i knew you before this yep yeah and then she says uh corner room and it was right so the room has no corners which is an allusion to a circle the hounds of tenderloose
7510.72 7555.44 speaker3  a question
7546.64 7602.48 speaker2  just fucking happened and i was on the edge of my seat with what he was going to do next and with what happened i was just so fucking so that's one of those moments in role playing where you just with uh pet pics and a question uh those pets were very adorable and they ask a question that
7595.76 7616.00 speaker3  how in some anime in some animes uh like they're in a fight and they keep revealing more and more powers and they're like getting stronger and stronger keith would be like the opposite of
7611.92 7667.04 speaker2  like the anime character who just like is constantly eating all the time and that's the best way i can put it everybody who's he's just not serious enough as a person in the way that everyone in fucking anime is about every little fucking thing they do
7662.48 7691.60 speaker1  i i don't watch like any anime so i will defer to you guys on what my trope would be i don't anime tropes generally it's tonally so not that john lee pettymore i feel like is like the badass
7684.80 7730.16 speaker2  this dark past that they're like trying to atone for or like get revenge for or something yeah
7728.40 7758.64 speaker1  he's also the protagonist of the story
7752.80 7783.60 speaker2  says if you guys were playing with bonds in the main timeline bonds is a mechanic in delta green where uh you lose and gain a good relationship with three or four different people two to four different people in your life and you can like basically your sanity uh is affected
7778.24 7806.40 speaker1  touch on it i think in one episode and we i decided that clark is a real sad lonely guy
7801.68 7939.20 speaker2  about maybe even having pawns i think as a mechanic i think john lee pettymore was going to use just the extended pettymore family as a bond and then like as as he called on them to do different things obviously that relationship would get strained as more of them were like taken by supernatural horrors but but thinking about it now john lee pettymore definitely has like an ex-girlfriend who got tired of his shit but still cares for him that like if shit really went down question and it was brought up on the discord uh pretty recently and crush posted in the uh in the question thread what happened to keith's dog and then uh bx borei 9181 who is currently doing a re-listen while taking notes and posting the notes in the subreddit which is dope uh very cool and fun to fun to watch uh i think she might have even been the one who posted it in the discord but anyway uh she said also if keith was in the city before coming home to contention what if like uh maybe he was running around in the creek bed having fun with all the other dogs
7932.48 7971.12 speaker3  and then chewed his way out of the hotel room and is swimming with the fishes no he's alive i would hope we haven't been to contention in a while so i've got to check on
7961.04 8202.56 speaker2  for like uh one hour one shot you guys play animals in contention who have to save bean from one of the people who are out there on the front lines fighting this thing good luck to you thank really miserable and annoying in a few months when you're going through backlogs of podcasts you
