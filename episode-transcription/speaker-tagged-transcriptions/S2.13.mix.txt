0.00 23.16 speaker0  We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode. Because I'm sitting here and I'm like, I don't like being here. Content warning, not fun. This one? Not so fun.
22.16 31.84 speaker1  It's... We're gonna go to an ad. An ad.
29.16 42.64 speaker0  Hey, listeners!
41.64 46.44 speaker1  What? Hey, listeners.
43.64 48.44 speaker0  Oh, are we the listeners?
47.44 59.24 speaker1  Fucking nailed it. So good.
57.76 64.04 speaker0  Luke, is the start of your day peaceful?
60.24 90.20 speaker1  Are you tired of being scared awake by your alarm every day, Joe? It's like waking up to a jump scare every morning. Are you losing out on precious sleep because of your partner's different schedule? Yeah, my freaking partner. Not anymore.
89.20 96.70 speaker0  Silent wake up? Silent wake up?
95.40 103.48 speaker1  What is silent wake up? It's the having a sandwich for breakfast of the alarm clock game. It is... Is that in the copy?
102.48 105.48 speaker0  No, it isn't.
104.48 114.76 speaker1  I don't know if you should say that. That's not true.
113.28 124.60 speaker0  I mean, I do like the...
123.52 131.00 speaker1  up. Sound alarms instantly wake you up by spiking your adrenaline and blood pressure, causing...
130.00 139.92 speaker0  Oh, that's sound... Because I was like, that sounds bad. I don't want that. That is not this product.
136.00 185.16 speaker1  That's like eating a turd sandwich for breakfast of the morning. Yes. Exactly. gently awakening you. sleepers out there.
182.72 205.44 speaker0  I'm a pretty light sleeper. It's because I got a shitty mattress, so if we could get one of those on next. I love thinking about them.
203.40 213.36 speaker1  Does your snooze addiction affect your wife?
209.92 216.64 speaker0  And you wake up hours later and you wake up with a silent wake up.
214.56 237.12 speaker1  Without any noise whatsoever. That's right. That's right.
234.12 242.40 speaker0  One more time!
240.96 579.00 speaker1  Everyone all together now? way back to the July 5th, 2022 times. Damn, I miss those pirate oceans. My fur though does not take kindly to the briny beast that is the ocean. Gotta re-grease up my quills. So welcome once again to the briniest broadcast this side of the Bermuda. 694.2 PTBP. You sometimes write me things. I sometimes read them. This howlin' with Wolf is from Derek Enfargo N.D., who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod, a very cool thing you should do. Derek Enfargo N.D. writes, Dear Wolf, you kooky bastards are the reason I got my group to start playing D.G. We at Fuckboys Central owe a debt to you for all we've gotten into. From stealing a helicopter and killing a hand monster with hellfire missiles to having a canoe-sized bomb dropped on an agent and explode the theater just as his bloody entrails slopped out for a ritual sacrifice. Drable. Thanks for all the fish. If you want to write up something for your salty wolf to howl, just do a quick little or Instagram, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and send them screenshots. The links are in the show notes. Click them. Cook them now. Or after the show. You just better look at them at the least. Sorry, being back in 2022 has me on the edge of my mind's chair. There's just so much more of the news. Last time, right after Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Zach stood up from recording the end of The Death of a Salesman, just like immediately after Zach stopped recording, Thomas exclaimed, Holy shit, did we just create the Bermuda Triangle? But back here in 2022, things aren't going so cool. In the hidden, unnatural, Godel company town, Grover's Gorge, Fred Godel is nowhere to be seen except on the screens in the train and the statue in front of the lab. However, Vernon Covington, the landlord, has with a large audience accused Cal Colorado, a turtle named Sandro. vitriol and violence. The latter was most harshly directed at Julius Summers, who lays on the ground bleeding like a fountain from his face, barely conscious. Taking us now to a conflictingly less-than-hell-yeah-dude moment, it's Altergirl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault. In the pirate ark. I don't know if I got one in here.
578.00 583.12 speaker0  Go, Joe.
581.32 586.12 speaker1  Is that how you're gonna use it? Argh. Oh.
585.12 592.12 speaker0  That was pretty good. No, it wasn't. Don't fucking... Oh. Oh. Oh.
591.12 595.12 speaker2  Oh. Oh.
594.12 599.12 speaker0  Oh.
598.12 603.12 speaker1  I thought it was pretty good. Give me an argh, motherfucker. Argh.
602.12 640.20 speaker0  I didn't know if you pushed people aggressively and got better results. Have you ever heard of Stanley Cooper? No, no, no. There's a difference between inspiration and abuse. What I do is abuse. Which ultimately provides better material. Excellent. This lady, though...
639.20 642.20 speaker2  Shelley Duvall. Shelley Duvall.
641.20 647.20 speaker0  Poor lady. Poor, poor lady. Yeah.
646.20 656.28 speaker2  Yeah.
654.28 668.52 speaker0  I was like, wow, bold choice. Let's see where it goes.
666.52 687.52 speaker2  And she said it in the exact same way. So somebody made a compilation of her saying it a million times in a row. It's really... She's a fucking pro. It's a fun video. She's an ultra pro. It's like perfect every time.
686.52 707.76 speaker0  Yeah. So, I mean, that's one idea. It's kind of just Gabrus's what's up shit heads. What if we just did the same thing every episode? Every time.
706.76 709.76 speaker2  Yeah.
707.76 713.76 speaker0  Episode one over and over and over again. Hold on, I got to turn my heads down a little bit. Until we get it right.
712.76 722.00 speaker2  Can you reach it? You can. Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.
719.00 723.00 speaker0  You said it the exact same way you said it last time.
722.00 753.44 speaker2  That was crazy. So, Zach. I don't want to be a pirate. We just got out of the pirate arch, which, holy shit, man, there were some things that happened in there. In the present world. It's just spooky.
751.76 765.92 speaker0  Luke, what was happening at the end of the last episode? Was Julius fine? You don't have it in your notes? He just looked to everyone in the room.
764.36 769.64 speaker2  He looked at it in his character sheet.
768.64 770.64 speaker1  Your character's name?
769.64 806.76 speaker0  Vernon. And then he was not having such a great day anymore, because he's almost dead.
805.76 814.00 speaker2  That's the thing. I'm louder than everybody else is, for sure. I always forget he just talks way louder than everybody else.
811.22 816.30 speaker0  Bing bong, bing bong, shooby dooby doop.
815.30 817.30 speaker2  He projects.
816.30 873.86 speaker0  Yeah. they do the... Hello, dude. Argh. Fuck. Argh.
872.86 879.62 speaker2  Yeah. Mm-hmm.
878.62 905.46 speaker0  Yes, thank you. Let us begin. Well, I do like the... Fuck. Okay.
904.46 921.74 speaker2  Hell yeah. Yeah.
920.74 933.86 speaker0  for the job of... Catching anyone up. Yeah. Would somebody else like to give it a crack? Julius hurt. We're fucked.
931.86 942.42 speaker2  Oh, we didn't need to... I really appreciate the effort, but I... It didn't have to be in four words. It did not have to be in four words that time specifically.
940.82 944.98 speaker0  But also very good job.
943.98 958.98 speaker2  Four words, Joe? You already told us what you were up to today. Three times, wow.
957.98 991.62 speaker0  Fucking your landlord. Pretty impressive. Yeah, we're getting old. Refractory.
990.62 1002.38 speaker2  time as much.
1000.38 1044.14 speaker0  Yeah, nailed it in one. We didn't kill the mayor. The mayor, if he was killed by anybody... With the help of possibly... The guy who asked you to watch it? Chuck Bidwell.
1043.14 1047.14 speaker2  Other stuff. Town mad.
1045.14 1101.90 speaker0  Yeah, turtle dies, town mad. before you headed out and saw the crowd all staring at you angrily, almost rabid, to see what happens to you. There's your answer, Joe. This is very similar to something that actually happened to me in preschool. This girl brought a frog to school and was showing everybody on the playground and it was all loose and everybody's looking for it and they all run up into this tree house to look for it there and I'm standing near the bottom just looking around and they all I was like, I don't think, well, yeah, the mob turned on me.
1100.90 1103.90 speaker2  Yeah.
1101.90 1135.90 speaker0  Why did you step on the frog, though? I wanted to watch its light go out. Why would they have thought that it went to the tree house? Because it was a cool place to be.
1133.90 1138.90 speaker2  Frogs live in tree house.
1137.90 1142.90 speaker0  True frogs do. Frogs live in tree house. That's right.
1140.90 1146.90 speaker2  And tree house frogs definitely do.
1142.90 1185.90 speaker0  Anyway, then they stoned me to death. Which is what we ended there. One of the teachers came out. Yeah, that's it. I mean, it was bad. It was a bad scene.
1184.90 1190.90 speaker2  Summers. Caesar. Julius the Simpsons. I almost said Caesar so many times.
1189.90 1213.90 speaker0  Summers. Stevie Gotel. Well. Starts with an F. Frank Gotel. Yep, her name is- Francis. Francis Gotel.
1208.90 1215.90 speaker2  No, I almost did that before I realized I did that name in season one, so I avoided using those names.
1214.90 1217.90 speaker0  Fox. Yes.
1216.90 1223.90 speaker2  Fox is the sun.
1222.90 1224.90 speaker0  He is, yes.
1223.90 1226.90 speaker2  Oh, wait.
1225.90 1233.90 speaker0  Faith. Faith. That was, dude, I took a lot of fucking notes in this crazy town. That was a while back.
1231.90 1275.70 speaker2  Yes, Faith Gotel. Faith was kind of, was she iffy about whether or not the judge was on our side or not?
1274.70 1319.08 speaker0  Yep. That's the way this world goes, guys. You don't know what's really in people's hearts, who you can trust, but I think most people are good. Probably not this judge. basically. Whoa. Fucking metal. Hardcore, yeah.
1314.28 1336.64 speaker2  that it's real, but also I just mean, let's zoom into each of your minds real quick and What is rushing through your mind right now? I mean, Beck was just bleeding profusely from his leg not 15 minutes ago, and he's been cured seemingly, and now you've come out and seen this.
1335.64 1342.96 speaker0  Oh, yeah. We didn't mention it, but also we cured Cal's poison ivy because we forgot about that. Oh, yeah.
1341.96 1349.00 speaker2  Wow.
1347.80 1352.28 speaker0  I lied to you just now. We didn't forget about it. You just got cut.
1351.28 1356.28 speaker2  Oh, we could easily put that in now. It hasn't come out yet. Somebody just comes in. That's true.
1355.28 1366.76 speaker0  Oh, that's true.
1365.76 1404.12 speaker2  Oopsie. I accidentally edited it out when I was drunk. Whoops. Uh-oh. It's wild.
1402.76 1418.32 speaker0  I wish I knew. Julius is, he's not really got much thoughts going on in his head other than like, ow, and if I fall asleep I'll die.
1412.24 1445.20 speaker2  Yep, those are the two things that makes all the sense in the world. I feel like Beck up until this point was just kind of both weirded out but also really into everything that's been happening so far and then he fell on a jackalope and that really messed things up. and hijinks and weirdness. This is, this is, this is no longer a news story.
1443.44 1454.92 speaker0  So weirded out here. This is all just a crazy misunderstanding.
1453.92 1474.00 speaker2  the kind of place. And that's, that's, that's not, that's not what Beck signed up for. Yeah.
1467.16 1499.96 speaker0  He doesn't, he, he tried to make these appeals to like justice and rightness and the law and like the power of journalism to shine light on dark places and got nothing. And his head, he's, he's just rapidly like turning through different variations of those
1495.36 1516.80 speaker2  Will you remind me, did, did, uh, Julius do something in particular to receive that wrath or did we do something and he was the brunt of the...
1510.64 1523.68 speaker0  And then he grabbed it and beat the shit out of me with it with my beautiful big thick thighs.
1521.36 1541.60 speaker2  I planned this character for this exact moment.
1540.60 1545.82 speaker0  You never know. What's going to happen. Hold on.
1543.60 1568.84 speaker2  I got to rewrite the end of this.
1566.72 1584.04 speaker0  So it's weird. their own.
1580.52 1599.20 speaker2  You realize the first time you get one of those babies in between your thighs for too long and you're like, they're seedless.
1595.32 1626.56 speaker0  They actually go to war with us because the first one to land who came in peace, Julius just like fucking raffles to the ground between his thighs and pops that fucker open. Kill the frog.
1625.56 1636.24 speaker2  All right.
1635.24 1641.24 speaker0  Yeah.
1639.24 1658.96 speaker2  You'll laugh your yak off.
1656.16 1685.84 speaker0  We have no money. That's Bobby Hills. Yakov joke. Yeah. of his show says, laughter kills the COVID virus. Dangerously false sec.
1684.84 1692.64 speaker2  Oh, okay.
1686.84 1696.00 speaker0  Encouraging a crowd of mostly senior tourists to all expel as much air as we can in a closed space.
1693.64 1699.12 speaker2  I just listened to whoever talked to me last. So I didn't know if it was true.
1698.12 1713.48 speaker0  Oh, it's not. Thank you.
1708.24 1782.76 speaker2  So you guys are looking up at what is basically now the King of the Hill, Vernon Covington, other. They're so far apart and spit is just like dripping off one of his lips as he's looking down at Julia Summers. This guy sounds hot. We see the faces of people in the crowd, people in yellow, people in green. We see the two medical staff who spoke up to say that Julia Summers had tried to assault them. Pretty harsh character witness as everyone's eyes turn to the judge, Susan Bloom, who kind of almost shakily steps forward and then quickly gains her confidence. She's looking at the four of you, but you all kind of noticed, well, two of you kind of noticed mostly that she's directing her gaze at Stevie, lip quivering. What should I do for her? What should I do for her?
1780.76 1791.28 speaker0  Is that what you want? No. When you say judge, also based on our new artwork, I think of like a powdered wig judge, so British.
1790.28 1795.60 speaker2  I'm the judge.
1794.60 1799.60 speaker0  Powdered wig. Oh yeah. Powdered wig. Lightning blue.
1798.60 1859.18 speaker2  Black gloves. Powdered merkins. And blue high heels. Electric blue high heels. So yeah, British. Oh, okay. Okay. Then I would say aristocrat, not cockney. Hell yeah.
1854.32 1871.92 speaker0  You were probably the most effective person to speak up at that moment.
1865.74 1886.32 speaker2  with your own blood spittling out of the hole in your mouth where most of your teeth used to be.
1882.40 1895.72 speaker0  So if we lose the trial, we'll die, but we could win.
1894.72 1917.44 speaker2  It's old school. Trial by stone. I literally already just charged you for the crime, didn't I? But that's the thing that happens in the trial. You get charged.
1916.44 1920.24 speaker0  after a trial. Damn.
1918.44 1953.96 speaker2  But they do different things here in Grover's Court. Yeah. They tell you how you're going to die. I sentence you to be tried for the death of Sandro the Turtle, our dear mayor here The trial will commence in one hour. You may roam free until then.
1952.96 1956.96 speaker0  That's nice.
1955.96 1963.72 speaker2  Oh, no, that's not right.
1962.72 1965.84 speaker0  No take backs.
1964.16 1977.36 speaker2  You all heard her say it, right? Everybody.
1976.36 1981.48 speaker0  attention immediately?
1979.92 1985.00 speaker2  Medical attention will be given. Thank you, your honor.
1982.48 1999.96 speaker0  Julius gives a rock horns. He's trying to hold his hand up.
1995.88 2018.32 speaker2  Should they be led free until the trial or should they be thrown in? I think they should go free. Yeah, let them go.
2016.24 2030.60 speaker0  before justice is properly expected.
2029.60 2042.68 speaker2  Is that the 30 seconds? Quick question. Yeah. I think so.
2041.68 2055.76 speaker0  Yeah, I think so.
2051.72 2067.24 speaker2  I just assume that Beck is literally like attached eye to camera.
2060.56 2077.52 speaker0  Your Honor, petition to have Julius' 30 seconds either split between Beckworth and I or he Julius barely is able to give a thumbs up.
2075.84 2133.96 speaker2  He may go last. And she looks over to the medical staff who are the two who were like threatened by Julia Summers earlier and they are both giving the flat hand under their chin waving side to side of like, no thank you, not us. be here to assist. Hell yeah.
2127.96 2155.28 speaker0  United States, but we believe that a person here is innocent until proven guilty and I
2151.80 2192.52 speaker2  And more words, 30. And also like neither one of these big statue guys are even here. So like how do you even know what you're supposed to be doing until one of them is here to like tell you what to do.
2191.52 2202.48 speaker0  a D4.
2201.48 2222.22 speaker2  Two. Well, two is enough to talk.
2216.72 2265.36 speaker0  I mean, up until you decide whether I'm guilty or not of the crime. But I would like to have time to formulate my trial argument and I won't be running away or anything because I know what happens to bad time. And Stevie failed.
2264.36 2326.24 speaker2  What were your successes? 43. That's a success. throw up some noise. If you believe they should be let free between now and the trial, and now let's make some noise.
2324.52 2347.42 speaker0  No, this is not the right move.
2342.76 2356.60 speaker2  behind and slaps a pair on Stevie.
2355.60 2377.22 speaker0  They left. Yeah. These are the guys who didn't want anything to do with you. I'm not just completely on my back, but I just let him not struggling snaps a couple.
2376.10 2379.22 speaker2  would look like. Like laser beams?
2378.22 2387.06 speaker0  Yeah. Like an energy beam. Yeah.
2381.22 2391.50 speaker2  But it's like energy beam cuff, but there's very clearly like tubing around where the cool pulsating light is coming from. It's like fiber optic.
2390.50 2404.74 speaker0  Yeah. It's fiber optic.
2403.74 2434.86 speaker2  Come on. Puts your camera nicely back in its bag. Like handles your camera with care. He didn't know how to put it in its bag, which is kind of tricky sometimes.
2433.86 2451.54 speaker0  Oh, right. Okay.
2443.90 2531.14 speaker2  like snap together in a line where like a rod like reaches out and connects the four That's what I was picturing. this massive, massive building off in the distance. Somebody like called you like the landlord. You like own this place?
2529.06 2598.86 speaker0  I'm a super landlord. the sky, your towering statues, but I understand they're not here right now. Would they be happy with this decision you've made? Which name? The it pit. Julius is kind of still out of it, like coming back to life, but he will remember the it
2593.30 2651.22 speaker2  As you guys make it towards this factory, you see plenty of happy and chipper ease wearing their work clothes, cute little jumpsuits that are both monochromatic and have little flashes of yellow all over them, heading in and out of work. But you guys do not take the front entrance as you lead you around the back. As you walk around the back, this is the first time you've really made it toward the trees. These trees are all around, and there's just this thick, hazy fog off in the distance that the factory. There are two metal doors that seem like they go down into a bomb shelter or a bunker of
2650.22 2652.22 speaker0  They're in the ground.
2651.22 2654.22 speaker2  They're in the ground.
2653.22 2694.70 speaker0  Much like a hatch. Just I don't know. Oh my god.
2682.74 2767.98 speaker2  He opens up one of the metal doors, opens up the other one, inside is only darkness, and out comes the most foul stench, decrepit, awful, human anatomy that's just been left out in blood that's coagulated and piss and shit and cum that's just molded over growing Boom! Immediately, the three of you just dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. And if anyone can hold on, you can give it a go here, but you're being whipped down and dragged by the human weight.
2766.98 2792.50 speaker0  the stairs, presumably.
2786.50 2812.82 speaker2  Yeah, Julius is the next one up, so Julius is staring down and you're seeing, I mean,
2807.86 2818.54 speaker0  I'm like, I don't like being here.
2816.78 2835.82 speaker2  This one, not so fun. Do we have a choice? I'm confused now. Yeah, how far- Did we all go tumbling in now because of her?
2834.82 2840.46 speaker0  She's just dangling by her arm. That's okay. Why didn't I say nothing? Sorry, Stevie.
2838.82 2858.90 speaker2  Yeah, that's what made that happen. I thought that she had hit with such a weird impact that it had snapped her arms up.
2855.58 2866.70 speaker0  Julius immediately gets a cane PTSD and he says, I think we should jump, and then he jumps. We got two and- Okay, I try to grab out.
2863.54 2909.34 speaker2  Oh, wait, I've handcuffed- Yeah, you have handcuffs on and Beck is actually next up and the two of you are the only ones standing, so I'm actually going to need strength rolls here in order for the two of you to stay up. I failed a 57 on a 55. Okay, a 45 is enough to where when Beck falls in, you skirt your heels right up to the edge and are able to just hold on, but as you do so, Beck's arms are about to do the exact same thing if you don't jump at this last second.
2903.78 2918.22 speaker0  I know my hands are down behind my back, but Cal just wants to try to throw himself back and grab out with his fingers for any part of Vernon's clothes and take him down with us. Awesome.
2917.22 2923.86 speaker2  Fucking cool. That's so cool.
2922.86 2935.54 speaker0  Grabby grabbies. Oh yeah, I've got a hundred in grabby grabbies.
2934.54 2936.54 speaker2  We actually did say that.
2935.54 2938.54 speaker0  That's why we cured it, I forgot. Yeah, I know.
2937.54 2941.54 speaker2  I know. Ooh, I'm talking.
2940.54 2945.54 speaker0  That's what I'm... I'm talking. Shut up. I'm talking here.
2944.54 2959.14 speaker2  No. The bear. You should roll athletics or decks.
2956.34 2978.86 speaker0  Okay, I'm going to roll dexterity. Wait, yeah, to change that to a seven. Right. Which is great because he crit fails. Oh, fuck yes. Holy shit.
2972.86 2984.58 speaker2  All right, because he crit fails, I'm going to say Beck keeps his arms, which is very nice for Beck. You're able to grab him. They were going to be ripped out of their sockets? Yeah, they were.
2983.58 2996.82 speaker0  Did mine? Did mine already do that?
2994.62 3004.46 speaker2  Yeah, you could come up. That was nice. That worked out well for you.
3003.46 3029.18 speaker0  Yeah. It's uncomfortable, but it's not terrible. So yeah, as Kal is slipping off, he just manages to get three little fingers around a belt. Inside the vest. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And he just yanks him off with us.
3028.18 3049.06 speaker2  Boom. And with the belt in your hands. I jack him off into the gumpit. Okay. Oh, fuck, dude. He can't get both doors, but also because he crit fails there, he's trying to grab on to one of the doors for any sort of like leverage on the ground, right? But that just ends up shutting one of them.
3044.78 3050.06 speaker0  And slamming his fingers and breaking his hands, right?
3049.06 3052.06 speaker2  Why not?
3051.06 3059.58 speaker0  Hands.
3054.06 3128.32 speaker2  As he comes down, he's got his fingers just on the edge, but then that door that he pulled up just comes down and slices off all of his fingertips. that is above you. So light is pouring in through that. And you see that Vernon Covington shoves his fingers into what is the ground, but what is essentially just a layer of, okay, so like the amount of skin that sloughs off of a human in like a certain amount of time, like leaves a certain amount of skin waste. Mostly what dust is. Most of the dust in your house. This place be dusty and the dust is basically turned to mud. Yeah. Because of all the shit and blood and common piss. Because of all the shit and blood and common piss. Yeah. You've got a pretty good idea of what that sounds like in here. Oh, did we say puss?
3126.32 3130.32 speaker0  Oh, and it'd be a lot of that too. Snot.
3129.32 3132.32 speaker2  There would absolutely be a fair amount of snot and puss. That's just some puss.
3131.32 3140.32 speaker0  Kind of puss really. Interesting. Yeah. And probably a bunch of skin cells in there too. Yeah. Yeah.
3139.32 3166.68 speaker2  So we got it double covered. I'm going to go ahead and say roll grip. Okay. But I did not. I'm an 83 on a 63.
3164.04 3169.58 speaker0  77 on a 56.
3166.68 3177.26 speaker2  I got a 41 on a 45. Congratulations Julia Summers. He's in too much pain.
3173.78 3203.54 speaker0  And like half blind and can't really tell what's going on. Literally the thoughts on my mind are who came down here with us and my wisdom teeth
3197.74 3218.70 speaker2  you critically failed, you lose the most for this role, which is five.
3217.70 3223.26 speaker0  That's a big old fiver.
3218.70 3229.18 speaker2  Hey, Zach, that also makes me hit my bow breaking point.
3228.18 3238.84 speaker1  Don't listen to that.
3235.20 3243.08 speaker2  take care of fight flight or freeze.
3240.28 3249.42 speaker0  So that's a three, two, one, right? So three fight, two freeze, one flee.
3248.04 3267.72 speaker2  Do I do that because of the breaking point? Losing five grip in one go means you got to roll that fight flight freeze.
3266.72 3284.36 speaker0  Beck got a two, which was freeze. Your name's Cal. Oh, Cal got a two.
3282.68 3286.36 speaker2  So you are doing what now?
3285.36 3307.04 speaker0  Yeah. Cal feels a brief moment of triumph as he drags the landlord down with them. But then as soon as he sees what's in this pit, instead of trying to beat him to death,
3301.84 3340.00 speaker2  And I think that in this moment, as you're standing there crying, it's one of those you're in here with me, I'm not in here with you situations as you realize that you have brought down a person who has been capable of extreme violence, whose hands are not cuffed. Weird call, but I like it. Beck Wilder.
3339.00 3346.04 speaker0  rolled a one.
3343.12 3390.04 speaker2  Joe business right there. He is far too concerned with his current situation right now to fight back. So you've got a free shot on him and because you're going with just like unbridled lack of grip on reality here, you are going to act in basically what is a surprise round Leg combat? No, I'm going to call that unarmed combat.
3389.04 3401.08 speaker0  Yeah. If you're not using your arms, man.
3400.08 3476.48 speaker2  It's a 12. Oh, that's great. It's uncontested. You can give him one great headbutt hopefully here. Go ahead and roll a- what is a headbutt worth? Nice. So Vernon Covington takes three damage as you- I mean through the slop in the mud beneath your feet. Do you want to describe how Beck headbutts Vernon Covington? with him. And he just kind of supermances his head into Vernon's head. If he had missed, he would have gone face down past him. Vernon just failed to stay standing. He is on his back prone and will now act last in this turn. What is your guys' dexterity? 45.
3475.48 3487.02 speaker0  75. Mine's a 50.
3485.96 3500.96 speaker2  Summers' turn.
3496.68 3510.16 speaker1  There's no reason- like now we're definitely going to be sentenced to death if we get out of here.
3508.60 3539.56 speaker0  He brought us here on his own. It's our word against his. He brought us to their fucking weird cum shit torture pit. So yeah, it was self-defense and we ended up beating him to death. Sorry, but maybe you should have a real police force here. I don't know. I'm glad you said it, but like Julius does not think of that at all.
3538.56 3569.40 speaker2  Thank you. As your turn turns the corner here, you see that Stevie is performing an act that is making Vernon Covington look in role-playing parlance bloodied.
3567.12 3606.60 speaker0  just crush his head between my legs. Like skull fracturing head smash. Yeah.
3602.16 3629.56 speaker2  So you are going to do one D4 minus one damage. So you do one damage to him. You are squeezing his head so hard that his actually, his a tipless fingers are now like reaching out for you. bad when he's trying to reach out.
3628.56 3644.08 speaker1  Well good.
3638.44 3679.84 speaker0  I guess Cal is kind of being dragged around by everybody on this line, but he's not really seeing what's in front of his face. He's just remembering conversations with like his ex wife where she's like, one day this job is going to get you killed. to pay the price. There's more important things, Cal.
3671.60 3712.76 speaker2  Vernon reaches out his fingerprintless fingers, trying to grasp and find his cane and he successfully does so. And when he goes to use it on Julius Summers, wrapped so tightly around his face, he is He's freaking out. The guy can't even fucking breathe right now and he's losing his absolute shit.
3711.76 3725.72 speaker0  Got him. Bible stuff. Bible slam. Yeah. He's losing it a little bit.
3723.48 3745.84 speaker2  Julius is deeply Christian. Stevie straight up, she was stomping on the face, but the face is taken. So she jumps into the air with both feet coming right down on Vernon Covington's ribs and Holy shit.
3744.84 3749.84 speaker1  Finish him. Finish him.
3748.84 3754.84 speaker0  Finish him.
3753.84 3766.08 speaker1  Finish him. Finish him.
3762.40 3779.24 speaker0  repositions and then just full force squeeze again. That'll be a three minus one, two. Oh, wait, I got to do strength check.
3776.20 3818.48 speaker2  I succeeded as well, but only with a 10. And you rolled? He's going to roll a constitution to stay conscious and he fails.
3811.48 3890.08 speaker0  in here and he's going to wait until he sees eyeballs pop out. Just continuously squeezing. I can't see his eyes. His eyes are in your teeth. And just medically that might not be what happens. Actually, this is, this is a spinoff of Sawbones. Uh, yeah, Julius is just going to keep doing it until basically until somebody pulls him Just continuously squeezing. I mean, he's worth moral to the world dead, but to us right now he's worth more alive. He's our only bargaining chip. Julius gives like one last little squeeze and then stands up and just spits on his face. Even the force of your spit hitting the back of his head makes his eyeballs explode. kind of smashed out.
3889.08 3893.08 speaker2  You know, with their eyeballs.
3892.08 3910.16 speaker0  Yeah.
3900.16 3939.64 speaker2  And as your eyes adjust to this low lighting down here in the pit, you see that all over every single wall are the same cryptic designs over and over and over seems to be drawn in whatever it is that's below you making up the ground here, slathered on these walls.
3938.64 3948.88 speaker0  Just send it. Yeah.
3947.88 3955.80 speaker2  Nice stars.
3954.80 4065.08 speaker0  Okay. Yeah. and it's wearing that, that thing, that sash you wear anyway. That's in the middle. Not like a square shape, like a, a, a, the square tool, I guess I'm looking at it. Okay. Yeah. And then continuing on the spiral is, am I looking at it this way or this way? Then there's like a wall with a gate, maybe some kind of doorway. There's a line with what looks like a door in it maybe, but I think it's a wall with That's a hammer. Oh, okay.
4064.08 4072.76 speaker2  Yeah. And we'll post this picture on Instagram at pretending pod on Twitter at pretending pod.
4070.68 4082.40 speaker0  You actually drew this on your walls. Yeah.
4081.40 4106.32 speaker2  Yeah. With my piss and shit and comments. It is Brown. No, I took that long arms.
4105.32 4125.56 speaker0  straight down.
4118.72 4142.76 speaker2  You see those just all over, like spiral to spiral covering the entirety of the walls and they all have these little designs drawn slightly differently, but in the exact same spots over and over and over and over.
4140.64 4145.80 speaker0  This is actually what a crazy person would make. Thank you so much. I am pee.
