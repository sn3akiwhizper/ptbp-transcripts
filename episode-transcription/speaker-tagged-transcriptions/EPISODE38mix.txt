0.00 159.34 speaker0  Hello people in this airplane we call life, it's your captain speaking Wolf the dog, and I'm here to airdrop some news on y'all while flying drunk. We are taking over the skies here at 694.2 PTBP the sky kingdoms newest and best and only radio show. Look out skybound geese I'm hungry for bird bones and these propellers are awfully sharp. I've got an announcement here from my producer it seems that a few days ago on the first of the month the third patreon exclusive episode dropped for all of our honorary police officers. Joe Luke Taylor Thomas and Zach got together and played a disgusting and delicious game of the end of the world. You can hear that as well as our first two bonus episodes, a Q&A session, and a game of everyone is john by following the link to our patreon in the show notes or going to patreon.com slash pretending pod and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging 5 bucks a month to keep the show alive. Honey might help wolf's bowels but honey right in to help wolf's howls it's howling with wolf. This week's howling with wolf comes from at the underdash millennial c who tagged at pretending pod in an instagram story y'all know how tickled I get when you take time out of your day to share the show with your friends. At the millennial c he writes It dumb, so much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets,
151.82 177.22 speaker1  so personal and meaningful it just... stop it wolf, stop licking up my tears, remember if you wanna write up something for your wolf to howl tag at pretending pod on instagram
170.26 311.62 speaker0  us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com fuck all that dumb social media bullshit after all it only dictates whether wolf gets to eat trash or has to eat trash and wolf has a distaste for mistakes that dicks fake to get milkshakes. It's time for the news Last time, Clark Bishop, John Lee Pettymore, and Keith Vigna came to the dark mausoleum of their former co-worker Ari Manstein. bottom of their left foot, Drew on the backs, and Tilly on their dominant palms. Keith Vigna called the number left by Agent Kennedy and he answered a few questions from an automated voice. John drove the three of them in Keith's cruiser to Jim Cook's house. In the neighborhood, every light pole was fitted with a sign warning residents about Clark Bishop. In Jim Cook's house, Clark showed his partners the book he found and slowly realized he might be the overseer that Maggie Cook and the Circle of Knowledge is intent on bringing back. for a room without a door. Keith knocked on the wall to avoid kicking a stud and then put his foot right through the wall in the hallway. It is December 6th, 3pm, and Keith Vigna has one foot in. I've got one foot out. And shaking it all about is kudzu with no backbone.
307.74 386.06 speaker1  I saw there's like a Zuckerberg one that was like, not verbatim, but basically it's like he was, he's the one like pushing a bunch of money so that people will go storm area 51 so they can go find his dad. Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. Alright, so Keith gets pushed through this wall by John Lee Pettymore and Clark Bishop. The drywall folds. Also Midsummer Spoilers. for you guys to look in and in this secret room is a small living room set up. There is a chair with an end table facing a small TV VCR that is sitting on top of a pile of thick books. There's a desk with a chair and there is a handle of vodka sideways on the floor next to the end table poured out onto the rug that barely covers the makeshift floor beneath. constructed and therefore the floor is this like plywood. Like walking. Just like sitting on the joists.
385.06 397.06 speaker0  Yeah.
392.78 399.58 speaker1  Like he's made the, all of the floor load bearing for the most part.
397.06 419.74 speaker2  And you said on the TV it's static or? Yeah, there's static on the TV.
410.18 452.78 speaker1  The books that the TV is sitting on are thick textbooks on radiation and physics and quantum mechanics. Just a lot of lofty shit. is a small vial of clear liquid, a scalpel, and a box of tissues. The vial. When I pick it up, how heavy is it? About as heavy as a glass vial should be.
449.34 458.58 speaker2  Real fast, now that we're kind of standing in the room, taking a look around, could I see another way into this room that wouldn't have needed to be knocked through a wall? Yes.
457.58 466.50 speaker1  What do I see? There's just a small door in the corner of the room.
464.06 474.62 speaker2  So this was a secret room. This is a hidden room. So I open that door and I see a wall in front of me and I can push on it to open it? Yeah.
473.62 476.62 speaker1  Where do I pop out? Just in the hallway.
475.62 497.80 speaker2  Upstairs. Okay. I have this vial in my hand. I'm like, what do you guys think this is? I'm not going to taste it, but I haven't opened it up yet. With all the weird shit we've been dealing with, I feel like if I open this up, two things could happen. One, absolutely nothing, and then we wonder what happens, or two, some fucking something crazy is going to happen.
495.60 502.72 speaker1  What if you become like a Batman?
499.40 518.24 speaker2  I want to, I don't know. And I opened it up.
511.20 535.16 speaker1  to grasp around the top of the vial and it's shaking a little bit and slowly twist off the top with the rubber dropper on top.
528.28 538.16 speaker2  As I learned in science class, as Keith Fignan learned in science class, I waft it into my nose to see if I smell anything.
537.16 555.88 speaker1  I love the wafting. It's important for science.
554.88 557.88 speaker2  for now.
556.88 563.88 speaker1  There was a label on it, was there?
562.88 568.20 speaker2  There's a man standing there. There's a hundred people wanting to fight you.
564.88 574.40 speaker1  Asking you to stop touching his things. Please sir.
569.20 580.28 speaker2  Can I do a search to see if I see anything else that I didn't just immediately see?
574.40 597.76 speaker1  Well, as you guys continue to look around this room, you would notice that on the desk are three folders and an envelope and the TV VCR itself, there is no antenna on it and there's no coaxial plugged in.
591.72 625.48 speaker2  Hey John, you mentioned a TV in one of your visions. Is this the TV? It doesn't seem, no, it doesn't seem like it. Can I unplug the TV? Yeah. Like a TV. Ooh, eject it please. I plug the TV back in.
617.92 632.84 speaker1  When you plug it in as John Lee Pettymore is clicking eject and a VHS pops out and it
631.08 638.48 speaker2  Stick it in there and see if we can not. Wait, is the VCR plugged into the TV or is this a TV VCR combo?
637.48 645.12 speaker1  It's a combo baby. I go and look at that tape.
643.26 658.76 speaker2  Is it periods between them or capitalized?
653.08 693.28 speaker1  An episode of Wheel of Fortune, of course. And as the episode begins to play, you meet the contestants. parents. A very young Clark Bishop's parents. They say that they had just gotten married and they are trying to win money for their honeymoon.
691.56 705.76 speaker2  and watches intently.
704.08 720.72 speaker1  that much vodka left.
715.56 740.64 speaker2  down and watching this, I'm like, Clark, I know that you like Wheel of Fortune, but is this really the time to sit down and start watching an episode? I've never seen this before. Those are my parents on Wheel of Fortune. That couple right there?
739.54 748.56 speaker1  The resemblance is uncanny.
747.56 753.24 speaker2  Oh shit.
752.24 765.84 speaker1  Do you look like your parents? I mean, I, yeah, I would say you've always seen it.
761.80 794.64 speaker2  I don't know how to, is there a role I can do to say, is there anything significant to their play or maybe the puzzles they're doing or anything that would ping for Clark as a thing that's interesting to note? to your parents' parts?
793.64 798.58 speaker1  fast forward.
794.64 820.36 speaker2  I'll just check out my parents' parts anytime they're on camera, push play, you keep going and watch that. parents. While he is watching it, I'm going to continue searching around this room.
819.36 832.08 speaker1  Yeah, absolutely. So you would notice that there are the three folders and an envelope that are on the desk that you haven't touched.
827.36 842.24 speaker2  Yeah, I would like to open up each of those starting with the first. Okay.
841.24 862.00 speaker1  papers. It is labeled Operation Stapler. How thick of a stack of papers? Quite thick. On the second page, there is a massive logo that you recognize. It is an M that is made out of four double helices. Is there an appendices?
860.36 863.00 speaker2  What's the thing at the very beginning?
862.00 932.02 speaker1  Index. There is an index at the beginning as well. So basically the front page says Operation Stapler. On the second page, it's got the logo of the M with the double helices and under it, with the same M spelled out, it says Myriad. So this is basically a program respec. So this is someone who is going through and rewriting an existing program to create androids. And the whole respec of this program is to cut down on cost and sell to private companies. They cut it in staff. They cut it in research. They cut it in supplies.
929.22 934.38 speaker2  they really cut costs on?
933.02 972.38 speaker1  Mostly just an overall cut. There are no indications. Not the word, but the... When you Google Myriad, go ahead and roll. Do you have a computers skill of some sort? Yeah, I have 50 in computer science. Oh, yeah. 69, which is a success. Oh, it's... Fuck it, 66. It's a fucking critical fail. Critical fail. Oh, no. Myself, my smartphone explodes.
966.06 974.38 speaker2  Actually looking at your phone, which is the phone that was just in Kevin's clothes.
973.38 978.38 speaker1  All right. Fuck. You texted Google.
977.38 990.42 speaker2  Cha-cha. What is Myriad? It just gives the description of the actual word. Cha-cha was awesome before you could just Google things on your phone.
988.86 1006.34 speaker1  Cha-cha was awesome. The screen on your phone wobbles in a very strange way and covers your phone screen before
1000.30 1012.26 speaker2  Real fast, are androids something in this world that we know about? Okay.
1007.34 1024.14 speaker1  It's weird how often that you've interacted with them in the past six days for them to have never been a thing in your life previous, aside from film and television, right?
1019.30 1030.74 speaker2  Which I think maybe we might get copyright stung on this by George Lucas. Yeah. He's a go-getter.
1028.66 1079.48 speaker1  I think he's droid, not android. They took a commanding lead in the very first puzzle. page it says Operation Hole Puncher. On the second page, there is the logo for the Circle of Knowledge, and then underneath it it says Circle of Knowledge. This one is a smaller paper, and the index is just a list of companies. As you go through them, Myriad is not on the list, and they are mostly non-profits, charities, think tanks, and universities.
1075.00 1094.10 speaker2  Is it small enough that I could maybe flip through to the first few, maybe like an introductory page and learn what this is, what it pertains to?
1092.92 1142.20 speaker1  and a phone number. How many companies are there? There are hundreds. Okay. They're knocking it out of the park. Both of them have now succeeded at calling out a puzzle, and they make it to the bonus round, the final round. Final Jeopardy, if you will. I figured they would. one of the pockets in this folder is this item, and you pull it out, and it is a dirty dog grooming key fob.
1140.80 1159.76 speaker2  Keith has a crazy idea. He opens up that first folder again. I slip the ring on my finger, and I press it to the page with the M embossment or image.
1153.60 1259.68 speaker1  As you move your hand closer to this page with the image of the M on it, your hands start shaking, and you get close, and then you press the ring onto the paper, and nothing happens. yet, and then the bonus letters come on. RST, that will mean. Thank you. And your mom turns to your dad and says, we're already given the best letters. They solve the puzzle, and win the prize of the wheel of fortune, and the prize is a honeymoon. It may as well be. They win a honeymoon. Where do they go? Branson. Yeah. Anyway. Thomas, John Lee Pettymore goes to the envelope, and I am now handing Thomas an envelope. You know the wheel of fortune theme song?
1258.68 1261.68 speaker2  Wheel of Fortune.
1260.68 1291.72 speaker1  That's it.
1286.38 1353.68 speaker2  is just called knowledge, which is the start of Jim Cook's letter disputing the revelations of the overseer. Faith through knowledge is just called knowledge. Fellow keepers, it is with great sadness I write to you. I fear a change is coming. I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent. I have recently grown a tail. He is an odd little man with round glasses on a fat face with no hair and no chin. He is a journalist fired for trying to write an expose on Marvin Glass. Stay alert. Step carefully. We are being watched, Jim Cook. Would that remind me of John Peters? Didn't he have a round face? Behind curtain number three. Harold Dorsey. Oh, yeah.
1351.68 1357.80 speaker1  Behind curtain number three.
1356.80 1361.28 speaker2  I don't know. I guess he could have been lying.
1358.80 1368.84 speaker1  That was just the first thing that popped into my mind. Yeah.
1366.84 1376.24 speaker2  He was a food guy. I guess he could have maybe stumbled on something and decided to run with it for a Marvin Glass thing. Yeah, probably not.
1375.24 1378.24 speaker1  I don't know. He was following around.
1377.24 1409.40 speaker2  God damn it. He was trying to get. Maggie Kirk. Maybe because she's Jim's son and he was following Jim. Well, fuck. I can't make heads or tails of the underlying letters. I got a Macau a GAC. Is that anything close?
1408.40 1430.04 speaker1  Yeah. You nailed it. 10 bonus points. Some of them are overlined. Some of them are underlined. I will post a picture of this letter on our Instagram at pretending pod and on our Twitter at pretending pod. All right.
1425.06 1435.52 speaker2  Listening along at home and you want to try yourself, you might want to go to the pretending
1434.52 1445.32 speaker1  Hop on there. Pause this. See if you can solve it yourself because Thomas is about to break this motherfucker wide open. All right. So it's two sets of letters.
1444.32 1526.60 speaker2  I don't know. There's two sets of letters here. Half of them are overlined and half of them are underlined. The overlined letters spell out Maggie. The underlined letters spell out Cook. I think old Jim was trying to tell us that his daughter Maggie is the, the trader he suspects is among us. I cannot be certain, but I suspect there is one among us scheming with treacherous intent. he was going over to Maggie's and Drew said, I'd help you in. Now that I think about it, Keith, Harold Dorsey just ran a blog. I don't know. He was old enough. He could have had a life in journalism before that. They said he got axed because he was touching a Marvin thing. about Marvin. Did he have an interest in the supernatural? building. Harold was following Maggie.
1525.60 1529.04 speaker1  Harold? Harold.
1527.60 1531.88 speaker2  Okay, let me start that all over again. Like a man, Carol?
1530.04 1542.12 speaker1  I thought it was Harold Dorsey.
1541.12 1547.12 speaker2  Okay.
1546.12 1560.84 speaker1  We're going to get you. Luck, please.
1558.88 1627.18 speaker2  Oh, I'm giving it to you. Or was he dead already when he walked in? Maggie's foot cut off, James, the mill worker's foot cut off. I don't know if he's eating it or not, but a plate full of foot meat in front of him, bullet in his head, tripped some sort of wire, and I had a split second decision to make. I drug drew out of there.
1622.46 1637.78 speaker1  surmised that he was a disgraced journalist who had been searching for Marvin.
1635.10 1687.74 speaker2  Have we looked into that? about Harold was the Daily Fud. He was a food writer, and Gary that runs the Daily Fud was following him around, but Gary also had images that relate back to the circle of knowledge in the Daily Fud. was he following him around because of the circle of knowledge or something like that?
1685.94 1704.64 speaker1  Was Gary following him around?
1701.20 1906.36 speaker2  but perhaps he wasn't really accepted by any of these groups. The circle of knowledge probably didn't let him in, but he had some suspicions, so he's following these people around. Maggie's identified as this traitor perhaps in this note, and maybe he got some word of that and that's why he was following her. and he just found some connection between the cooks and Marvin? Occam's Razor. me, us, I suppose, that Maggie inducted you into this circle of knowledge. If her dad is saying that, I mean, based off this envelope, that Maggie's not to be trusted. She's gone rogue, perhaps. Do you think that he suspected Maggie and then decided that the circle of knowledge that was in the first letter that we read? Do you think, so, I'm sorry, do you think one led to the other, and which way do you think it went? I'd imagine that one came first, since he quotes his own phrase, faith through knowledge And perhaps his doubts in their book led Maggie to turn against him. slogan. Maggie said it to me, actually, herself. She was telling me that she knew I had faith, and she needed me to have knowledge. all this new stuff, if her own father, if we've deciphered this correctly, her own fathers She's the chief, Keith. I've always trusted her with my life, but the chief died. We don't even know the focus Maggie Cook is. I saw Maggie Cook dead, but you're saying that you saw her alive, and she inducted you into this thing, and now I've got this letter telling us that she is not to be trusted. What do we do about this? it's her or not, the thing she showed me was real as day in my eyes. I saw the thing. It scared the daylights out of me. But what if she's not showing you the whole truth? They're only telling you part of her plans. I'm just saying, if she's telling me that she wants to stop the thing, I would want to stop the thing. So, I mean, I guess she could be lying about wanting to stop it? Well... I don't know. I want to stop the thing, fellas. I agree with that as well. later on, but I think at the end of the day we gotta stop, you know, whatever's going on. I think Marvin Glass is our biggest problem at this point right now.
1905.36 1907.76 speaker1  Exactly, John.
1906.36 1956.68 speaker2  It's something we can do. me into being his ally. Well, and Kevin John, I mean, what's... I don't have any loyalty to him, but... And neither do you, so I think this is who we should be focusing on right now, and I think we gotta head that way, and I still like our original plan that... Can he find a connection between Jim and or Maggie to Marvin?
1949.32 1963.00 speaker1  out, which is a folder that is labeled Operation Three Ring Binder, and has a dirty dog grooming key fob inside of it. Didn't Maggie have one of those?
1961.76 1974.56 speaker2  How do we reckon that that's a connection? Yeah. Well, we're operating under the assumption that this room was Old Me's room, right? Isn't that what we...
1972.76 1977.76 speaker0  Or it'd be pretty weird if it wasn't.
1976.64 1979.92 speaker2  No, he wasn't.
1978.92 1983.40 speaker1  He's just living in his house.
1980.92 2013.46 speaker2  It's probably a letter Jim Cook wrote to him, maybe, if he's part of the survey. Keith walks out the Keith-shaped hole in the wall and says, come on, boys. Let's go. Let's go to Marvin's. Let's go to the glass. Let's go to the glass. Let's do our plan. We have a lot of new information.
2012.32 2015.92 speaker0  Do we have a...
2014.52 2044.48 speaker2  We're going to Chewbacca you.
2043.48 2057.52 speaker1  counter. Make sure that we got that all accounted for. The leather holster was grabbed by Jon. The ring was grabbed by Keith.
2056.52 2065.66 speaker2  Absolutely.
2058.64 2091.68 speaker1  And there is a Ziploc bag containing the single tarot card of the devil with several bullet holes in it and a taxidermied baby squirrel. And as you guys are re-looking over all this, you would notice now that you've seen Clark's parents when they were young on the TV, you would recognize that there is a picture of them on the fridge with Jim Cook. They are posing with silly hats and Jim Cook is begrudgingly smiling. Does that mean anything to you, Clark?
2090.68 2130.12 speaker2  This picture. No, I'd never seen that picture before. players? Seeing that picture on there, I just was surprised that they knew each other. I just kind of thought it was neat. It helped me believe that I was on the good side when Maggie showed up. That's for sure. My parents, it was nice to see the parents smiling once again.
2129.12 2134.12 speaker1  I did not.
2133.12 2144.64 speaker2  Yeah. Was there anything in it?
2142.22 2177.14 speaker1  than just, you know, seeing your parents. But you would notice when you looked at the tape itself, it has been played so many times.
2172.96 2191.70 speaker2  Does that change anything for anybody or mean anything for anybody, if we take it as fact? When I saw attacks at everything, I thought of Julie Maxwell, but it didn't really ping anything in my brain. I don't...
2190.70 2208.62 speaker1  I don't think so.
2201.46 2235.78 speaker2  And all that was in it was a picture of a woman with short curly hair, shoulder length maybe, and a mouth that took up half her face with a look of unbridled pleasure on it. Did you know her? It really gets to the heart of the torrid storm that rages in a young person's heart and mind as they go through adolescence.
2234.10 2245.50 speaker1  It gets to the hard on of the matter.
2244.50 2270.74 speaker2  Not really. So devil, Satan, shot, tarot card... I don't want to talk on this right now. I want to keep playing the game. I do want to talk on this. I don't.
2269.74 2271.74 speaker1  We can talk about it later.
2270.74 2272.74 speaker4  How was your 8th grade just like really nice?
2271.74 2322.10 speaker2  I just want to play the game. I want to play the game. Fuck you. Devil card with bullet holes through it. You saw a Satan file. I mean, I don't know what that means. So I thought I'd bring it up. Gotcha. Seems like maybe both sides of this are eyeing someone. Hail Satan. That they, yeah. Can I inspect the card a little more? Is there anything else I can glean from it that maybe I missed?
2315.94 2339.10 speaker1  holes have struck through it and you feel the ridges and you look at the card and it
2336.98 2346.38 speaker2  might have made change anything for anybody? think of anything.
2345.38 2385.74 speaker4  All right. I pocket that bag with the contents inside. You want to go? be armed. Cause I mean, unless, unless there's something that you can hide away, cause you're our,
2382.30 2395.44 speaker2  you're going to be our, our, we drag them in there. He can be loaded to the teeth. I mean, the second we reveal our, our deception, he starts firing too.
2391.80 2400.66 speaker4  So I think you should be as secretly armed as you can.
2399.66 2406.42 speaker2  in lightly armed.
2402.28 2424.60 speaker4  But at the end of the day, you, you may be unarmed. That's what I'm, I'm just preparing for the worst is you get stripped of your arms. We are armed up enough. We throw you something, but we're going to have to fight our way out of the middle of
2420.82 2433.82 speaker2  what I'm saying, man, is the second anybody comes at him to like search him. That's when we start shooting. I don't think so. If it's, if they frisk us at the front door, I don't think we're not going to start shooting
2432.82 2444.02 speaker4  through the front door. Okay. Preparing you preparing for the worst. That's all I'm saying.
2443.02 2457.34 speaker2  I think you worry too much. I'll put a, the world's going to hell. I'll put a, man, John actually kind of a group of Keith on this one. If they frisk us and I've got guns on me, if they're going to ask why you didn't take them, we just kill those guys at the door.
2455.14 2489.78 speaker4  And then we start a shootout and we don't win it. I think we need to get all the way. They look at us and they, I mean, they trust us enough, but not more than they trust anybody else that works there. So I'm thinking he goes in unarmed. We go in real armed. If they ask us why we got arms on us, then we say, cause we got this guy. He's he's not armed, but he's dangerous.
2485.88 2518.12 speaker2  The other members of the glass family or his henchmen or whatever, does everybody know that you're John Lee Pettymore in Kevin's body or that no one knows that. So you, it seemed when we were up in our cages, had a kind of the run of the thing. Exactly. You're like captain to him. Yeah. I think they're going to trust me. them now, which that might make it hard to get in in the first place. But I think we can bullshit our way past anybody trying to frisk you.
2517.12 2519.12 speaker1  You can throw it.
2518.12 2521.12 speaker2  Yeah. You could throw your perceived weight around.
2520.12 2525.16 speaker1  Exactly.
2521.22 2531.06 speaker2  If they, you know, if they find the guns on you, we just say, we're getting you here in a hurry and thanks for finding them and taking them off of them and we'll collect them and

2591.06 2657.90 speaker1  ears kind of perk up and he's like, Oh, uh, actually if you guys want to come on back here and he, uh, kicks the back door open. Thank you. Large Eddie. dreams. There's some with cool sights on them and others have silencers and there's some big ones. There's some shotguns.
2656.30 2671.16 speaker4  to that one and I touch it. It's kind of like cold to the touch and I asked big Eddie, what's this one?
2668.48 2681.10 speaker1  And he's like, oh, it's just, that's just a real big gun. That's a nice cold gun. Cold fusion gun. It works in cold weather.
2680.10 2699.54 speaker2  Is it a fusion? It's the cold fusion brand firearm. Capital C, capital F.
2698.54 2710.90 speaker4  Fully out. Oh, I pick it up, throw it on his card and I sling it across my back because it's already got a leather strap on it. Ooh, that's nice.

2755.82 2764.14 speaker2  Original flavor. Yeah.
2758.82 2769.54 speaker1  How are you guys approaching this concept to get into the glass?
2764.14 2775.82 speaker4  That is, I think we go right into the front wherever. Yeah.
2770.54 2838.12 speaker2  So I know pretty well how to get us through there if we go in through the den of sin through the dirty dog room and uh, the street access. So I, I think I can sneak us pretty deep into this place if we, uh, so we wouldn't even have to like meet some folks at the front door. I like that idea. we just say, Hey, we're taking this man personally to see Marvin Glass. straight to Marvin. We kind of want to talk them a little bit, don't we? that this ends in our glorious deaths.
2834.28 2851.96 speaker4  If we got to shoot him, we injure him, but we talked to him. Maybe he's valuable. Maybe he's not. We kill him. We shoot our way out or sneak our way out and then we head straight to contention. It's what I think. Try to find Drew.
2846.76 2877.30 speaker1  You guys are discussing this as you drive into the heart of the city where John Lee Pettymore knows the alleyway in order to get in to the den of sin and the three of you strapped up exactly how you want to be prepared for what you're diving into. You go and step on this large grate on the ground in this alleyway. John Lee Pettymore pulls the dirty dog grooming key fob out of his hand and lifts it up. And with that, the three of you do fall through a trap door and begin falling.
