0.00 100.76 speaker0  Hello, and welcome y'all. It is December the 6th, and my clock here says it is 1030 a.m. here in the city. What time is it in your world? What is time anyway? Is it a circle or some shit? Shit, I don't know, that's for sure. this dimension's best radio show that is fueled by dumpster meat of varying quality. I've got a howlin' with wolf here from an anonymous source. Remember, if you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl, tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write a five-star review and email us at pretendingpod at gmail.com. This one is a bit unsettling, so no point in settlin' in. We alone are the last of the line, ascendant when the giants walked and still clutching to power when the last ragged outpost of our kind fell to internal ruin. Our line will rule again. There are secrets buried still, lost in the deserts forgotten and places where man cannot go. Our illusion is perfect. We walk unseen through the streets in the child scrawl of the world before us, and we resist the call to feed, the smells, the meat. We resist, for there is clarity and starvation. Just as in our disguises, there is freedom among the savages, and then in the desert where we buried our last machines,
98.92 104.08 speaker1  there is salvation.
102.06 315.78 speaker0  Once they started talkin' about meat, I just kinda lost track there, y'all. Anyway, things aren't any cleaner or clearer here in the city It's uncertain, it's impure, it's the news. Stan Manstein left the city asylum, a rare occurrence, in order to speak at the funeral of his daughter, Ari Manstein. He spoke in a strange tongue, and the world slowed down around our three officers who heard Stan speak inside the heads, tellin' the story of a particular past of the town of contention. Clark Bishop shot Stan Manstein mid-story, bringin' the world up to speed and causin' full-blown chaos at this funeral. People began to run for their lives as our obliviously intrepid heroes fought, shot, and demolished the large guards made of blood and metal. Keith Vigna plugged Stan Manstein's wounds with his fingers, givin' him just enough strength to complete his story and blip out of existence. John Lee Pettymore IV, inside the body of his adopted father, John Lee Pettymore III, who the officers met as Kevin, Marvin Glass's head of security, tried to explain that whole convoluted mess to his former coworkers. The officers took stock of their situation, tryin' to remember where the weird items they'd found are currently located. Last we saw, John Lee Pettymore put his hands up to his head and his eyes turned white. Man, I tell you what, I left contention because of all this weird nonsense, but it seems to have followed me to the city. Wolf. Oh, no, Wolf. What if I am the sinner from which all struggles emanate from the pulsating heart of darkness? Does it all come from little old Wolfie? Uh, probably not. I have a message here from my producer. They say we are sitting at 84 reviews on iTunes. That's about 16 reviews short of bein' real nice, and 336 short of bein' real nice. So we got a super special announcement in mind for when we hit that 100 review mark. You'll be happy, Wolf'll be happy, and when Wolf is happy, he claps his hands on the three and the four. It's kazoo with no backbone. No.
307.28 494.04 speaker1  As the speed of this sequence waxes and wanes, you see a motel safe, shiny, black, and closed. You see the sign for Bean's Pond, the little pond behind Chief Maggie Cook's house in contention. You see a television. It is blinking with different letters on it, R, S, T, L, N, E. You see a small clearing in the woods, and the ground is scorched. In a dark room, lit by various electronics and machines, you see a massive, shiny metal sphere, 20 feet tall, with silvery arms extending from either side. A tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below. The machine begins whirring, and you see a small metal sphere, roughly one inch in diameter, light and sound pours into the room, revealing text painted on the back wall that says the you recently stood in as Kevin, alongside Rosemary. Marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes, closely inspecting it, tapping its lit red luminaire. On his desk are two file folders, splayed open, entitled, The Real Files on Clark Bishop accidental deaths of William and Lena, Keith's parents, the takeover of the family business by Ferguson. one of her eyes. Written in Sharpie, underneath the mugshot, it says in all caps, Karen. Your vision readjusts, and you are standing in the mid-morning sunlight near your partners,
493.04 502.36 speaker0  Oh, yes please!
499.70 535.76 speaker1  Lee Pettymore four or five episodes ago. Sure. Because I didn't. Had to go back in and listen to that? Had to listen to it again and wrote it all down on my phone. Absolutely. So, uh, with that I need you to lose ten luck. Down to twenty luck. No longer able to survive if you die. Let's do it.
535.66 536.26 speaker3  Ramona.
535.76 537.08 speaker1  Ramona.
536.26 540.46 speaker3  Ramona.
539.86 572.72 speaker2  Ramona! Woof!
571.56 585.72 speaker1  What do you think he's up to these days? He's either dead or he's making shitty podcast appearances. Nice.
584.84 590.16 speaker3  Was that the answer? Or did they have to know his name or something? Oh no, it was the Jimi.
587.92 610.08 speaker2  You had to know Boris Fonks-Kold. Little shout out to the Patreon listeners. Dr. Carbohydrate Uncle.
603.04 657.92 speaker1  On Monday, we released our second Patreon exclusive episode in which we played Everyone is John. It was delightful. It was a lot of fun. You try to save John Peters. Let's play this dang old game. And he looks at you with a startle.
657.56 672.68 speaker0  Yeah.
666.68 766.48 speaker2  At least I believe I developed the second site in my transition from John to Kevin. What did you just see? And here's what I saw. Oh, shit. I saw Bean's pond behind Maggie's house. I saw some other things, too. Marvin Glass has the camera. It's currently in his possession. I know what you saw, the lockbox, the safe at hotel motel. Yeah. I got it after his unfortunate demise, but I put it on and some real weird shit happened. I felt like I was like on an alternate plane while I had it on and I knew I had to take it off. I know it means something, but I, I couldn't have it on my body cause it was just doing some fucked up shit. So I threw it in my safe in my hotel motel room.
764.28 780.56 speaker3  Was it as though the ground were made of light?
773.32 878.36 speaker2  I was still in contention or around there, but in my mind I was seeing different stuff. It was hard to decipher what was real and what I was seeing, but I knew it was something, it just felt evil. And I had to throw it in that safe cause I thought the longer I had it on the weirdest shit was going to happen. And I it's, it means something I'm sure, but we'll, we'll have to go check that out. And I think with the three of us together, cause I was by myself when I had it on. So I think had I had it on just by myself for a while, I might've gone insane or something. And when I thought about the objects, these are the things I saw and I saw Marvin glass with the camera, but then I don't know, it sounds like Keith's describing an object of, of power that he put in that safe. What can be in these other places? What were you saying that right or wrong?
875.52 879.68 speaker3  John and Keith, you even might know what those are.
878.44 892.96 speaker2  R S T L N E. Exactly.
892.56 909.36 speaker3  Yeah. Clark pulls up his shirt and shows Keith.
909.00 945.84 speaker1  All right.
939.12 964.56 speaker3  In the bag with ice, but next to it was another bag and it had those letters in it. Well, okay.
956.92 1057.36 speaker2  So one thing I also saw, uh, Marvin glass knows a lot more about us than we might've originally suspected. Um, he knows a lot. He knows everything about your history. Oh shit. Clark, I've got something to tell you. I don't, you might already know. All right, boys, let me actually start at the beginning. We're not the first group of three to try to combat this kind of stuff. There was a group called K cell. K cell was Kevin. What? So it was Kevin man named Kyle and a woman named Karen, also known as an love. And Karen was the only one to get away. He made Kevin shoot Kyle and, and he essentially took over, took over his life, his soul in some way. And Kevin was his soldier from then on out. Marvin glass was looking for, for the metal sphere. He has one.
1057.00 1058.24 speaker3  Yeah.
1057.40 1254.44 speaker2  Why does he want them? I saw something pretty terrible. Just now, all these people want these fears. We found one Marvin glass was one on one for years. He has one. He wants to know how it works. It was like one of those fears, but massive, gigantic, gargantuan. I watched one of those fears go one of the small spheres and a, a huge light opened up in the ceiling. So this thing could, could come through. And all around I saw these letters, these words, it said planet juggernaut like that. Keith Clark. The transition to my new body is a wrecked havoc on some of my neurons. Shouldn't I have this asshole's memories? Do I have this asshole's memories? I'll try to access this asshole's memories. Oh yeah. Thinking about it more. Uh, I remember it's coming back to me. I, when I had it on one of the feelings I had was like, I felt like wet grass and dirt on my fingers. And I remember seeing a metal door, like buried almost slightly underneath this grass and, and, and dirt. And it said, here lies the beans, scientists beyond measure, saviors of the world. And as soon as I saw that, I think that's when I had ripped the watch off of my arm and went and thrown it into the safe. So like, are you more capable than you've been letting on? Are you a scientist without measure? No. Do you feel that within yourself? It could be my parents.
1251.72 1267.48 speaker3  Uh, Silas and Mary Cole problem back in the day.
1258.40 1289.88 speaker2  I don't know who would have been the scientist, but we, I don't know where to find whatever I saw in that, but I feel as if it's real. And we, I think maybe there's something in that that we need to check out. What do you think? Well, I know that I personally came from Cole's orphanage. John Lee Pettymore, the third adopted me from there. I don't know who my real parents are.
1285.36 1300.72 speaker1  Cole's orphanage, new school under modern etiquette.
1294.64 1317.48 speaker2  You're adopted by John Lee Pettymore, but you're in Kevin's body, but you're in your dad's body. The only, Oh, right. John Lee Pettymore, the third is Kevin. He was part of K cell remember, but here's the point. I think maybe the beans adopted you too. I think maybe we all spent some time in Cole's orphanage.
1316.08 1326.52 speaker3  No, my parents are my parents. How are you sure about anything?
1325.12 1362.76 speaker2  How can you be sure of anything? I'm not sure of anything. And your daddy is your daddy. We just came from different penises. Then the ones what raised us. Yeah.
1362.48 1369.20 speaker1  Okay.
1366.20 1385.60 speaker2  If we might not have all come from the same orphanage. You ever think about that Clark? Cause it's not like there's not great childcare options and contention.
1384.76 1390.60 speaker3  It's the bar.
1390.24 1393.56 speaker2  I see. That's that's a,
1392.00 1425.52 speaker3  I'll always have a soft spot. Yeah. Yeah.
1422.64 1441.72 speaker2  Well, I've had a tough week, so I think I can handle.
1434.20 1462.88 speaker3  standing in Glass's office and boy, it sounded an awful lot like he hired you to kill your brother. And you, you, you asked where the money was.
1453.08 1514.64 speaker2  I don't know what the point in hiding this from you is anymore, but, uh, I didn't know that it was Marvin Glass hiring me to do this. My, my niece, she found me and she offered me a million dollars to kill her dad. And I don't know that I've talked a lot about Fergie, but, uh, it's not, it's common knowledge that him and I didn't get along since, since we were boys. And so when that opportunity rose, I never thought about killing my brother, but the chance to become a millionaire and get rid of that asshole. I jumped at it. So I went and, uh, I didn't kill my brother, but I guess you could say if it wasn't for me, he'd still be alive today. So, uh, when I saw my niece with Marvin Glass and the scientist lady, I knew what I got myself into.
1513.56 1518.96 speaker3  Was she anybody to you?
1514.68 1663.76 speaker2  Only person in that glass building I knew was my niece. I had no idea she was affiliated with people like that. Yeah, it could be worse. It could be one letter off. I don't think they had any intent on giving me that million dollars. And he said, he'd give me that million dollars. Keith, did you know you was saved by fish men? I, I, yes, I saw them. And what do you think about, what do you think about that? So I saw, I was much more concerned about getting out of glasses building. I saw them and it freaked me the fuck out, but I did get help from a fish boy. Uh, so they're not all bad. I got the, I got out of there. I accepted, I accepted the proposition from Marvin glass and I came to the funeral. That's all I know. Oh my God.
1662.28 1665.60 speaker3  I mean, what does that even mean? I died. Yeah.
1665.00 1673.76 speaker2  I'm back. I said he was the new Charles.
1673.00 1677.16 speaker3  That's a big one. You got on your hand there. Yeah. Clark.
1675.76 1686.28 speaker2  That'll come into play later. Are you not going to give him credit for shouting out our favorite movie in the precinct? The one we all used to watch together.
1684.64 1687.84 speaker3  Ace Ventura, pet detective.
1686.84 1730.72 speaker2  Batman forever. That one. You guys, obviously you can see the scars. I don't want, I don't really want to talk about it until I figure it out, but I don't, there's nothing you need to worry about. I'm on your side. I promise. John Kevin's eyes, narrow.
1729.36 1745.08 speaker3  Do you know what that means?
1739.56 1758.32 speaker2  I haven't seen anything suggesting what that is other than making the big ball work. That's interesting.
1755.68 1772.80 speaker3  I hadn't thought of that Keith, but I mean, who knows? We've got the ball, one silver ball, right?
1767.68 1827.16 speaker2  We put our, it disappeared into our bag, but I think that bag is still, it wasn't ours. The agents brought one. I think it's still in the skull of that lady, right? No, John has it. You do? John just picked it up and he's had it ever since. No, I don't know how much that's my house anymore. I mean, I still like Smokey, but, uh, here's the thing boys. That was kind of always on my person. I just had it in my pocket. I didn't, it was a comforting wait. I didn't know what it did. So Marvin has it. Most likely. Yes.
1825.84 1855.68 speaker3  Real, real quick for us. Sure. they, they tasked us with neutralizing the threat, I believe was part of their MO. As far as I know. Yeah. Shouldn't they be doing something? Who do they work for? Are they on the glass?
1853.60 1894.08 speaker2  I had all my days of running together. How long ago was it that we saw agent McKinley two days ago? He was, he said he, I have not in voicemail. Yeah, but I want to call him and see if they'll answer.
1889.68 1914.20 speaker1  And I believe his phone went straight to voicemail. Yep. And I want to try it again. Well, so did they say they'd call the police department?
1912.52 1922.84 speaker2  hours, they'd be in contact with us.
1920.60 1933.92 speaker3  where that card with their number would be.
1930.16 1954.52 speaker2  restaurant or something and let them take care of contention. They were going to come back in two days. We've got alibis, new lives. We disappeared. bag that gets rid of the balls.
1951.80 1957.88 speaker3  If they get put in the bag, they get sent to the thing that John saw.
1956.52 1962.04 speaker2  That's an interesting proposition.
1959.24 1966.24 speaker3  If they're working for glass, we'd find some balls and keep putting them in the bag and they keep going to the...
1963.24 1988.60 speaker2  Now maybe, but it seemed like they was awfully scared of those balls. What if we gave them a call? We've got their card. We got their number. What's the worst that can happen? We can try to decide whether we trust them or not. What do you guys think?
1984.24 1991.52 speaker3  And Keith, I mean, who knows who they are though now.
1988.64 2016.44 speaker2  It's going to be a couple hours till they get in contact with us. They told us that we might as well give them a call. See, I don't know that we have the upper hand, but if we have any sort of, if we're doubting that we can trust them, you know, we can call them and see what they're saying. And we might try to be able to get something out of them because we know about glass and everything. We might be able to get something out of them before they can, you know, get to us.
2012.36 2043.32 speaker3  Let's, let's, let's take a step back now fellas, now that we've laid all our cards on the table. What, what do we want to do to, to prevent calamity? designs on the town of contention. I've seen things that make me think the world's in jeopardy. You have the glass family after you had maybe the glass family is our, our first thing.
2041.76 2070.76 speaker2  They might still think I'm one of them. And that's thing is neither of us killed Stan Manstein. So I may, I wouldn't have to infiltrate the glass building. I could just go in maybe under the guise of bringing the guy that killed Stan Manstein in, and then we can, we're all three in there. And if shit goes awry, then we can, uh, I liked that a lot.
2068.72 2079.20 speaker1  You're going to use Clark Bishop as your Chewbacca.
2077.68 2086.16 speaker2  to kill Marvin glass. I like that.
2081.80 2091.64 speaker3  And I think I'm on board for this plan, but just for the record, I don't know if we killed Stan.
2088.68 2130.08 speaker2  I don't know that he died, but he blipped out of existence. Keith. My task was to bring him back and that is seems like an impossible task. Now it seems like I failed to do that. So yeah, we'll just tell Marvin glass that you're the man who killed Stan Manstein. unquote FBI people back and just see what, see what they say. what that means? Maybe they're somehow affiliated with that.
2129.04 2143.24 speaker3  It sounds like the case. So was doing the same kind of stuff we were doing, right?
2142.20 2173.24 speaker2  police officers. We're not, well, we're, I mean, maybe not anymore, but what do you think about just giving them a call? We don't have to meet up with them. We don't have to tell them everything we know, but I'd like to see what they think when we call them back. weird shit that's going down. confirmed that it's happening.
2171.72 2188.36 speaker3  I don't know if it helped. I mean, we could be helping them inadvertently, but you're right. I mean, or I'm right. It seemed like they were at least offering the branch to help ourselves.
2185.08 2207.48 speaker2  We don't fuck with them, but I don't, I don't think there is a harm in calling trying to do a, a Darren raid on Marvin glasses, we don't have to tell them that we're doing that we need, I'm saying just get in contact with them, see what they have to offer and we go from there.
2204.12 2213.00 speaker3  We'll have to, yeah, we'll just have to put on our acting pants and make sure that they don't know that we know things about them that you were in
2212.00 2225.16 speaker2  theater in high school.
2222.52 2230.64 speaker1  I need you to roll alertness for me. Read, read them off guys. A couple of tins. I'm sorry. What?
2229.20 2231.44 speaker2  Who has the highest alertness?
2230.64 2286.04 speaker3  A 70. Ooh. Like what do we, what do we want? So we're going to be calling them and telling them that we failed. We, I mean, 48 hours has passed and we haven't neutralized the threat. Is that what we should lead with? Or I think so.
2285.08 2286.92 speaker2  I mean, both. Yeah.
2286.52 2296.56 speaker3  Yeah. Or, yeah, it was something that there's no way we could have tackled in 48 hours had even if we'd known.
2296.08 2319.88 speaker2  good. Otherwise call us. Well, they might even still think that we're in contention dealing with that. Cause I think we've moved on to bigger things outside of contention. I think we should just be straight forward with these people. I don't know who the fuck they are, but they're not Marvin glass.
2318.24 2325.56 speaker3  We're hoping they're not Marvin glass.
2320.04 2332.92 speaker2  I say we, I say we feed them one, one major line instead of all the details and then see what their reaction is to it. What is the major thing we talked to him about that?
2330.04 2344.00 speaker3  Well, we'll have to, yeah, we'll conduct the conversation with. Suave and effortless.
2342.76 2358.60 speaker2  How do you feel about that? Sorry.
2357.12 2368.72 speaker3  but I get the, I get what you mean.
2361.84 2406.48 speaker1  You hear this absurd scream coming from on top of one of the crypts that is nearby and surrounding you and looking over, you see this massive creature begin to materialize in front of you. And it is gaunt and it has translucent skin and it is wearing a black suit. please hand me the book, please. trow?
