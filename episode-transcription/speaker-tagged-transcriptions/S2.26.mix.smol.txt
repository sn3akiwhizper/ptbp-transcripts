0.00 86.60 speaker0  Good evening to all of those who join me in this dimension we call home. It is I, Wolf the Dog, DJ Extraordinaire and also Enjoyer of Slop. And I'm here to sling some sound directly to your ear canals. The radio station is called 694.2 PTBP. The time is now and forever ago simultaneously. And the best part of the show has arrived and it is starting. Now, this here howlin' with Wolf is from Ben Feliciano in Denver, Colorado. Who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod. A thing you can do too if you wanna rule. Like, rule, not rule. You know, Ben Feliciano rules. And he writes, Hey Pretendy Friendies. I'd like to howl at my bandmates in Younger than Neil. Listening to and talking about RPG podcasts is one of the many ways we pass the time at rehearsal or in the tour van. Besides trying to guess who farted by scent alone. We're no kudzu with no backbone but we do like making ska punk.
84.50 106.70 speaker1  And PTBP. On May 5th through the 27th of 2023.
102.30 290.60 speaker0  I'll be there on opening night and periodically throughout the month. Visit BenFeliciano.art for more details. Praying for you but more importantly to you. Do you hear me, wolf? Do you smell the blood on your altar? P.S. Should I try different candles? Maybe you're not a fan of lavendar. And I do see you at all times. You make music, you make art, and you love little old me. Remember y'all. Go to old Ben's art show if you can and tell everyone there that wolf sent you. Fuck Al Gore. Or write up a five star review on the podcast app of your choice and make me aware of it. Oh, hey, you. Yeah, you. You seem cool. You can help support this show and make sure it keeps happening by exchanging five US dollars for shitloads of bonus content over at Patreon.com slash PretendingPod. There's other cool shit on the internet, too. What's that? No news? Ugh. My producer is telling me the boys, almost all of whom are in their early thirties now, except Luke who is seventeen years old. I guess these dude kids do a fine job of reminding themselves where they were before things really get going. Welcome back, y'all. And get ready for the world to unfurl. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and it's All My Fall.
286.60 302.30 speaker1  They're like, I don't know, regular kind of cookie on the outside and then filled with panda with like chocolate and they're shaped like pandas. That sounds good. They're super good, but they're always out of them.
297.60 306.10 speaker3  And so now I learned, if you ask, the lady will go in the back for you.
304.40 315.00 speaker1  I will load it up and show you.
314.00 337.80 speaker3  to see what was back there.
332.60 352.00 speaker1  It's like, yeah, just like, I don't like cracker cookie kind of thing on the outside. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's not what you think. It's not salty flavored, but it's like sea salt because it's like sea salt ice cream. So it's kind of a creamy soda. It was really good. Is it a little salty?
349.84 360.60 speaker3  Is it like sea salt ice cream or is it called sea salt ice cream? Is it a little?
358.40 371.68 speaker1  There wasn't a whole lot of saltiness to it, if any. Like I think it was just what the flavor profile was closest to. Except that it was really good. Yeah.
370.68 389.36 speaker3  We're like, Joe, why didn't it suck? Hey Joe, what's your problem? Ooh. Yeah. Whereas sea salt soda is almost inherently misleading.
388.36 392.36 speaker2  Yeah. It sounds like a fucking prank. It's not your fault, Joe.
391.36 402.58 speaker3  Yeah, it does.
398.16 415.48 speaker2  We are back at it after a fair amount of time away. We were off in holy cow farmland. Yeah. It's shit. And for like four episodes. And before that we left you on a proverbial cliff. What? What?
414.48 423.48 speaker3  Who's here? Oh, I think we're live streaming.
422.48 430.48 speaker2  Nope. Nope. Nope.
429.48 432.48 speaker1  Oh, whoa.
431.48 435.48 speaker3  Wow.
434.48 436.48 speaker1  Yeah.
435.48 478.88 speaker3  She just zoomed away. All the way through the house. Aw. That's way, Taylor is way bigger than just your heart. A lot of you has a hole through it right now. I think we're about the same size. In her shape. You're all crust. That reminds me of a scene in Kung Pao Enter the Fist where he punches a guy's stomach out. And he's like, what? And then he's like, okay, you can pass.
476.88 487.88 speaker1  Oh, yeah. Shit.
484.68 490.88 speaker2  Oh, that's why you said just the crust. Just the crust.
489.88 493.88 speaker1  Yeah.
490.88 499.88 speaker3  I missed it and I thought you were saying that I was made out of crust or something.
498.56 508.12 speaker2  Weather or earth or pizza. Just the Luke crust. And like dong.
504.72 512.96 speaker3  I think that's a realistic interpretation if they like stood like Michelangelo style
511.96 520.24 speaker2  Yep. The Vitruvian. Luke.
519.24 524.76 speaker3  The Vitruvian.
523.76 536.80 speaker2  Yeah. Y'all done did a dang thing that people say that you're not supposed to do, but something Yeah.
535.80 558.88 speaker1  Split the crew, baby. Same.
552.20 565.60 speaker3  I went back through it for a lot of the Pennymore arc and respected a lot of choices more that
564.24 579.60 speaker1  Julius was off on his own. Peace. Bye bye. We said deuces. Top gun.
578.02 595.00 speaker2  which we've already recorded. Spoilers. I think we're going to start with Luke, which we recorded a couple of days ago.
591.96 612.96 speaker3  So we'll all not be in the room then and then. Okay.
611.96 614.96 speaker2  I think we got to. You're the DM.
613.96 634.40 speaker3  You can. No.
632.40 644.08 speaker1  After crocodile wild.
640.56 696.44 speaker3  Maybe they've made a box around me with their space time bending powers. They have a certain eldritch hate fuck factor about that. Also Mr. Mime undoubtedly, canonically fucked Ash's mom and is his father. That's some big dick energy. Is that real? has been living with his mother in Pallet Town. Wow. So he's like a stepdad. It's Mr. Mime Time, huh? Let's do it. There have been Luke Luke. I'm Luke. Is Thomas here? Nope. Is Joe here? Not a chance.
695.44 700.44 speaker2  Is Justin here? Um... Oh, he is. He's hiding in the closet.
699.44 715.24 speaker3  That's right. Play with your keyboard. Do what?
713.04 790.16 speaker2  Just play the music again. mindset. Julius Summers get up to the night of June 18th. Let's go back now to that wild night at the foundry, as a sweaty, writhing mass of interns drool chant and breathe all out of their slack-jawed maws. from the now saliva-covered, bare stomach of Julius Summers.
789.12 828.32 speaker3  What's up, man? One of the interns rips their shirt and throws it on the ground. Julius grabs that and cleans his stomach up a little bit, wipes some of the liquor and drool and other fluids off.
819.68 838.48 speaker2  initiate into the news conglomerates, foundry regulars here in the city, hops onto the bar and takes your previous position.
837.44 882.88 speaker3  It's late. The sun's down. It's not quite up yet. And he just starts walking down the road. He gets just out of eyesight of the foundry. He stands up completely straight, looks his head over to the right, opens his mouth and just vomits. But not like his body is telling him to, but like he's telling his body to. Yes. It's a text alert. He pulls his phone out and looks.
881.20 884.56 speaker2  And it says, it's Bernie.
883.84 893.04 speaker3  Yeah, exactly.
885.28 902.00 speaker2  It's like, looks like an automated text, but it just says Z, like a lowercase Z.
900.64 958.08 speaker3  starts to jog. When he gets to the main road, he pulls his phone out and calls a car. He gets in the back. What is that? It's like a self-driving car. Oh. You know, like the ones with the giant camera. It's like a prototype. They're running in the city. That sounds cool. He gets in that cause he doesn't want anyone to know. No, of course not.
948.40 1007.04 speaker2  Not quite fully a space needle height, but a poor attempt at the monument up there in Seattle here in the city. And as you drive up, the car stops in the parking lot where there is shit pouring down. There is a slight uneven level to this parking lot. There's one other car in this lot and it is a slick, sleek, chic, clean, black, matte We've never dealt with that before.
1005.28 1046.08 speaker3  Should we 30 seconds of silence just engage? I hope the elevator is broken. And he starts heading towards the zeitgeist and he's going to run up those stairs because
1039.92 1069.20 speaker2  And as you approach, we see the lovely ground all around this area. It's lovely. Oh, it's so lovely. Man, there's no holes around here. As if really no one's hung out around here, at least in a digging capacity. And you walk into a jar door at the bottom of the zeitgeist.
1066.96 1132.72 speaker3  Do you even check if the elevator is down? No. He's getting the leg workout in. Okay, you kept that. I think it was like eight. So many. He finally maybe starts feeling a little something in his legs, but he's a little disappointed with such a meager workout. Reinforced. Right.
1127.44 1190.72 speaker2  this old and decrepit room in a large circle. You kind of see around the rounded corner of this kind of internal bar and the windows, some of which are no longer there around the outside. And standing and kind of up against where there was a window once. You see a woman familiar to you wearing a black suit, white shirt, black sunglasses. It's like a scaly tail that reaches down and around. She turns holding a package in her hand that's closest toward you.
1190.24 1206.48 speaker3  Good. I'm learning a lot about TV stuff.
1204.16 1275.92 speaker2  the Godel farm. I can feel it. It's only been a day. well, I just want you to remember that with the pressure that we're putting on the Godel company, we're going to likely have to deal with some Godel-owned pigs here in the city. And for each one that, I don't know, let's say doesn't have a job anymore, it's going to earn you quite the promotion. Needs to be delivered. 7251 West Shift Street. In exchange, you'll receive a package as well. We'll be in contact when I need to retrieve it. Sounds good.
1273.68 1288.64 speaker3  No, it'll take too long getting down the stairs. Let me go.
1282.48 1311.44 speaker2  back out of the zeitgeist through the bit of woods down to the parking lot where the driverless car is waiting. It's like, how far would you be willing to run right now?
1307.12 1317.92 speaker3  When he pulls it up the walking direction, say two hours and 17 minutes, 45 minutes. Yep.
1316.16 1322.40 speaker2  It's been a long fucking day.
1318.96 1335.44 speaker3  He's feeling like maybe a beer made it into him.
1330.16 1381.04 speaker2  It's seemingly like built by someone with a specific image in mind of what they wanted their home to look like. It's not like any of the other older homes in the area. A lot of ranch style houses around here. And this one is kind of a mix between that older look with almost like a modern architecture to it. The yard is absolutely filled with all sorts of oddities. Other seemingly decorative objects.
1377.76 1409.04 speaker3  Julius doesn't really care. He's there to give and get and then get out. Up to the front door. That's good timing.
1408.24 1425.60 speaker2  Be my guest.
1424.80 1439.12 speaker3  David Spade.
1437.12 1471.84 speaker2  cargo pants, rugged boots. He's got just like stained with dirt all over his shirt, all over his hands wearing a bit of like a gray brown cowboy hat. Just a bit of one apparently. He's wearing a faded gray brown cowboy hat. And you see behind him in the entryway, there is a shovel leaning up against the wall within view that is glinting in the morning light shining in through the door. He quickly takes the package from you.
1470.80 1478.64 speaker3  You first. Oh yes, of course.
1477.28 1502.40 speaker2  Let me grab that for you. And he closes the door. You hear a bit of a rummage. He rummages to completion. and hands you a bag, a tote bag.
1499.52 1510.96 speaker3  and then kind of like gestures to the yard. And it's like, so like, what's, uh, what's all that?
1510.72 1524.56 speaker1  Yes.
1521.76 1539.12 speaker2  He gets an off distance look. He's gone in the, in the sunrise as he's off on my mini expeditions.
1537.36 1560.32 speaker3  And he's still smiling. Oh, he looks in the bag? Yeah. Since if it was a package, he was going to not unwrap it, but it's in a bag. He's going to look. Yeah.
1559.20 1562.48 speaker2  There's a piece of parchment.
1561.52 1577.28 speaker1  He's going to read it.
1573.76 1586.24 speaker2  And do you have any skills?
1585.04 1589.20 speaker1  Do I have any skills?
1588.16 1604.24 speaker3  What specifically?
1603.68 1634.64 speaker2  Interesting. It tells you two things. One, this is a stone rubbing and two, you've never seen this language before, but you think you might know someone who can help you out with it.
1632.40 1665.20 speaker3  Julius makes a note of it. He can leave it on the kitchen counter for his handler, who is his roommate.
1662.00 1734.32 speaker2  Let's pick up exactly where we were with Julius Summers. And you see two other people sitting at chairs on either side, closer to you. Both kind of turned back looking at you. You see cops, one tall kind of spindly, one short ball jacked. And they all look at you. What's up, Neff? How's it going? How you living? Oh, forget about it. Come hungry for you. We got some stuff we need to take care of. Where's your boys? Where's Beck? Where's Cal? I thought I told you to bring the whole team down, baby. Give up on the Godel company. Give up?
1733.68 1738.32 speaker1  Give up?
1736.08 1769.28 speaker2  I would never give up on the Godel company. kind of laughing to themselves. No, no, we are absolutely not giving up on the Godel company. The Godel company is what's taking us into the future, baby boy. Come on, Neff. Come on. Let's go.
1768.64 1770.40 speaker1  Yeah.
1769.28 1777.44 speaker2  Let's see that phone.
1776.80 1777.84 speaker3  Okay.
1777.44 1793.36 speaker2  Okay. Calm down. Demands of one thing, requests or another for our new promotion man. Okay.
1791.76 1838.80 speaker3  from where are we? We're at the kids bar. staff. That's a weird one. I'm not done. I want your, I want your private executive bathroom. Wow. That's a big one. I want Cal to be the lead anchor. Okay.
1836.88 1850.88 speaker2  That's kind of doable more so.
1850.48 1876.08 speaker3  Okay.
1874.96 1880.16 speaker1  Oh, okay.
1877.84 1892.40 speaker2  Um, no speeding is fine. Fine, fine. Sure.
1890.88 1912.48 speaker3  Julia starts to sweat a little bit. I want them to pay me not to show this. How much, how much do they pay you money? No, no, no.
1911.76 1927.28 speaker2  Come on, man. This is, this is the future. Julius. We're talking about a whole new world, man. We're talking about a million dollars. Is that what we'll talk about it later? We'll get the details down later.
1925.60 1963.44 speaker3  Now, listen, this is important. This is an important one. I want a Tony little's gazelle freestyle glider home fitness exercise machine with the workout DVD in my office. Is that like hard to find? I don't know. I remembered it and it's good for your thighs. Okay. I'm almost done. I want to travel and fitness show that runs after the five o'clock news. And I want to call it summer's vacation.
1962.08 1968.96 speaker2  pitch and we can at least. Yay.
1965.92 1995.84 speaker3  And then this one, I will not concede on this one. I want the marbles re-installed in the walkway of the entrance and he pulls out a marble from his little pocket. Of course. Yeah. And he flicks it over towards one of the gobs. Julius pulls out two pistols. Oh my God.
1995.28 2026.72 speaker2  Okay. Shit. Fuck. Yes. So you get to go first and that is after your surprise round. So let's start with a deeply surprising round.
2026.24 2030.80 speaker1  All right.
2029.92 2125.28 speaker2  Gets these two dudes. Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly cop reaches up to grab it and you fire directly through his hand with one of your shots as the other one. He does stay conscious, uh, but he's lying flat on the ground at this point. Blood is like spraying out around where the marble has embedded itself and type is freaking the absolute fuck out. But Wilson Wiley immediately dives for cover behind the desk with Tife and flips it on its side. Tife's enormous solid wooden desk is now in between you and Wilson Wiley, the tall spindly Tife yells out to you with his turn. And with that, it's Richard Riley's turn and on the ground. He moans back up to the top of the order. It's your turn.
2123.92 2151.52 speaker3  This is not over. And then he starts running towards the desk towards Wilson. his legs, spin, and then land on the ground with his gun aimed at Tife. Okay.
2147.44 2228.24 speaker2  an athletics first to successfully dive over the desk. Uh-oh. So as you're running up, Wilson Wiley just kind of stands at the last possible moment, throws his hands up as kind of a block. His hands are the only thing up above. And so they're kind of grabbing on either side of the inner thighs and just kind of like holds you right there. And you're like sitting on top of the desk at this point in time. And the two of you are grappling each other, essentially at this point. And it's Tife's turn. You can now see him as you're looking down directly at him. What the fuck, man? I'm not going to- Good. You hear just kind of this like, ugh, and he's slowly getting himself off the ground behind you, but that's going to take his entire turn to just kind of like right himself at this point. And it's back to you.
2227.36 2241.84 speaker3  his legs. Yeah. He's going to shoot Wilson right in the face. Jesus Christ.
2240.96 2246.96 speaker2  your firearms. Okay.
2245.44 2251.68 speaker3  I failed with a 77.
2250.08 2265.12 speaker2  So how do you execute this man?
2260.88 2283.44 speaker3  Julius spreads his legs, lets Wilson's hands free. Julius is like, whoa, whoa, whoa. And then just shoots him right between the eyes.
2276.08 2295.04 speaker2  And as you're firing, he's like, and his gun goes off as well.
2293.20 2312.80 speaker1  Oh my God, he's dead. Oh, he's fucking-
2304.88 2321.60 speaker2  Yet he just continues to vomit as Richard Riley is finally standing, slowly looking up with you just executing his partner.
2320.72 2333.92 speaker3  For him? He fires at you.
2332.48 2335.76 speaker2  How many hit points do you have?
2335.20 2354.24 speaker3  Oh, God. So yeah, he is down to three hit points and it hurts.
2349.04 2373.84 speaker2  half of the hit points in damage that you currently have. With a 24, you stay with it and it is your turn once again. This dude behind you has just shot you through the shoulder. There's a dead man in front of you and Typh is puking his brains out with a hole in his shin to the left of you.
2372.24 2376.24 speaker3  God damn it.
2374.64 2389.52 speaker1  I thought you're fucking dead.
2382.48 2404.40 speaker2  you miniaturized yourself to the point to where each hair on an eyebrow was the same height as you and then you walked across his forehead, you would have no trouble traversing the terrain.
2400.08 2422.08 speaker3  Julius looks at the guy who just shot him, looks over at his uncle. Fuck. And he walks up to Richard Riley and is going to just try to punch the marble into his brain.
2419.76 2486.32 speaker2  We're going unarmed combat against each other. He succeeds with an ought six. 83. Okay. With one arm. As you go to punch him, he just grabs your arm, kind of throws you back and throws a left hook at you at the same time. Your nose has recently been like completely obliterated and then healed by some sort of wild tech. You immediately feel your nose kind of like bust back open as you go to two hit points. You once again have to roll a constitution check to stay conscious as the world around The vibration is gone. Your stomach feels like fucking steel and you've never, ever been more focused. Crit success. Your turn. Let's go.
2484.96 2496.96 speaker3  He gets punched in the face. No thoughts go through his mind other than this has to end and he just unloads his clip into this guy. Okay.
2495.36 2512.56 speaker2  We're on against each other once again. 26, which is a pass. And as you both go for your guns at the exact same time, you kill him, your back is up
2512.00 2516.56 speaker1  against the wall.
2513.76 2527.28 speaker2  You wanted to do the fun marble thing in your mind. You're like still bummed that you didn't quite finish him off in that way, but you
2524.16 2549.84 speaker3  Julius's vision is kind of tunneling in a little bit. He's losing some blood. His face is on fire from his re-broken nose and who knows probably facial bones as well.
2547.84 2554.08 speaker1  Julius, seriously, you can't.
2551.92 2563.84 speaker2  We were, we were onto something.
2560.48 2568.96 speaker3  I have one more thing on my list of demands.
2567.44 2575.12 speaker0  Whatever you want is yours.
2573.12 2580.24 speaker2  No, you're not a fucking Raylan.
2579.84 2590.00 speaker1  cops. What is it? Why am I going to have to call the police? Everything's fucked now, man. Everything's fucked.
2588.40 2602.40 speaker2  You fucking ruined everything.
2601.36 2629.84 speaker3  Are you fucking serious? Tell me I'm a Raylan.
2626.72 2647.12 speaker2  Immediately, the body of Wilson Wiley farts.
2646.56 2663.92 speaker3  Roll grip. No, that's not going to do it. That's an 89 on a 25.
2661.04 2668.24 speaker2  I'm going to go ahead and say D4 plus one. Yeah.
2667.44 2771.36 speaker3  Two grip. And that puts me past a breaking point. Hey, that's fitting. Julius just killed his uncle who, you know, whether they got along, he still killed his uncle that he loved. else. He doesn't see the dead body of Typh Raylan. He doesn't see two dead cops. The blood. A little pond. He sees little koi fish swimming in it. Oh no, no. I gotta get this stuff out of here before he sees it. And Julius starts cleaning up the office to get out the sculptures. So that's not gonna cut it.
2769.44 2777.76 speaker2  How are you getting rid of these sculptures? Are they in the bathroom? The executive bathroom?
2775.44 2807.44 speaker3  Well, Typh has his closet- Shower. Well, Typh in the office has his closet full of suits in case he needs to change for a So Julius gets the sculptures and puts them in the shed. Yep. He thinks maybe they're not too bad, so he leaves those. Plus he doesn't know how he's gonna fill it in or something.
2806.40 2812.96 speaker1  Yeah, it's too much.
2812.08 2844.82 speaker3  He's had a hard day. Julius walks out of the office confident that he's at least gotten rid of the sculptures that some people might think are a little gaudy or ugly, but they're hidden away in the shed. He walks out of the office, goes downstairs, and then once he sees the marble entrance without the marbles- Yeah. He kind of comes back to-
2844.32 2893.20 speaker1  Julius? Julius? Can I get you a coffee or anything?
2891.20 2907.60 speaker2  in hushed tones speaking to each other. People are on their phones. People are taking pictures and video as Jeremy kind of walks toward you nervously looking back at everyone.
2904.80 2915.46 speaker1  Okay, okay, we're going to the Natcher Hole.
2914.96 2926.00 speaker3  Yeah.
2925.04 2941.92 speaker1  Stevie! Over here! It's us! It's us! It's Cal Colorado!
2937.28 2964.80 speaker2  And you are sitting at the northeast corner of- Oh, look at that. I pointed at each of them and they were like,
2962.24 2974.48 speaker1  Like that was a real silent silence.
2972.24 2991.76 speaker2  silence, that would be very unsettling. Well, that's kind of our thing, right? We're supposed to be at the south gate.
2987.92 2993.44 speaker1  My notes say northeast side of the Natcher Hole.
2991.76 3002.40 speaker2  What south gate are you talking about?
3000.24 3017.28 speaker1  I was going to say, it's been a while. That's fair. To be fair, the Natcher Hole used to be a stadium. So having a south gate isn't the most ridiculous thing.
3016.32 3021.92 speaker2  No, it's absolutely not.
3020.48 3034.32 speaker1  Let's go back to what Thomas said.
3032.88 3038.96 speaker2  Yeah, I was the janitor. That sounds like a nice job. It was lovely as the nighttime janitor.
3037.68 3046.72 speaker3  Yeah, nobody's around.
3043.68 3064.64 speaker2  So it was a nice setting. Did you just piss on the pews and be like, well, they were clean when I got done with them. Very fun, but not that one. Bummer. You want to call for Stevie? Stevie!
3063.36 3073.52 speaker1  Stevie, Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! Stevie! It's us! Hey, hey! Cal Colorado!
3071.60 3078.56 speaker2  Exactly where we're supposed to be. Exactly.
3077.28 3084.72 speaker1  Got all cops.
3080.56 3119.20 speaker2  wearing cigarette legged jeans and an oversized black hoodie. They have earbuds plugged into their ear holes and a thick wall of dark wavy hair covers their eyes, nose, and top lip, only revealing a black lipstick covered bottom lip, pierced with a small hoop.
3117.28 3130.88 speaker1  I thought that meant South Gate. I did too, to be honest.
3129.36 3164.64 speaker2  He insisted we sit in the bleachers.
3163.84 3167.84 speaker1  Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stevie, Stevie, where did they go?
3167.04 3170.24 speaker0  Oh, shit.
3169.68 3171.92 speaker2  Stevie?
3171.36 3189.12 speaker1  Stevie?
3181.28 3249.60 speaker2  blood on the street next to your car and then it's going in a line back around. And then at that very moment, you see Stevie coming back around the front of the car with some sort of contraption in their hand and they are spilling out blood. They finally connect the circle. Oh, I hate blood. You check. And so Stevie is muttering something under their breath and as you go to hit the gas and the blood finally meets back up around this Cadillac, I need you both to roll power.
3248.56 3271.28 speaker1  Critical success. 33 on a 60.
3264.56 3319.44 speaker2  You're standing on a sort of synthetic, almost bouncy material, like a sidewalk. And there's a row of homes in front of you. And one of these homes is slightly larger, slightly nicer than the rest. Absolutely gorgeous architecture. Well kept garden. And in that moment, as you speak with each word that comes out of your mouth, the reality around you sort of loses its shimmer, loses its sharpness.
3318.56 3333.12 speaker1  This isn't happening. I'm in my C class.
3327.12 3338.80 speaker2  You're looking over at Beck and Beck's eyes are kind of like rolled back in his head. I started slapping him. Beck Wilder, you feel the slaps?
3337.36 3362.08 speaker1  Beck, Beck, come back. Come back. You're in the C class. What the fuck?
3360.48 3372.90 speaker2  seemingly while you were out. However, they are out currently. Eyes kind of rolled back, but like they might come to at any moment.
3372.40 3403.20 speaker1  Stevie? Cal, hit her. try to disperse, like make it no longer complete circle. Cool. Very nice.
3402.72 3415.44 speaker2  What's up?
3412.08 3426.80 speaker1  declining on my list of favorite can interns. Why don't you tell us what's up? Yeah. Stevie, where's Fox? I don't know.
3424.64 3441.68 speaker2  I mean, you saw the news, right? Did you take him to the bridge? No, I didn't take him to the bridge. Like that's not Fox.
3439.84 3450.64 speaker1  there and we could tell that you let him loose.
3449.92 3465.78 speaker2  Fuck. And it was Grover's Gorge. Was it my house?
3465.28 3469.44 speaker1  Yeah.
3468.08 3472.88 speaker3  Was that your house?
3471.36 3476.16 speaker2  It's like where it was going to start. Stevie, why did you do this?
3474.00 3492.80 speaker1  Did you know a place like home us?
3490.24 3497.20 speaker2  I think you guys would maybe like-
3494.72 3508.80 speaker1  They want us like dead there, right? Like we escaped a trial. Like you weren't there.
3506.08 3538.00 speaker4  and I'm really sorry about that, but I- So what, Stevie? because there's some shit going down. Yeah. Clearly you could handle it yourself, Stevie.
3534.88 3554.80 speaker1  if we're still your friends, we can help you out of it. Okay.
3553.36 3572.80 speaker4  To give to us or- Like what, like I had maybe a different plan, but-
3572.56 3583.12 speaker0  Yeah.
3582.64 3604.40 speaker1  Yeah. Beck, maybe if you passed a role, definitely Julius, you could have just gotten a copy.
3601.44 3617.76 speaker4  If it's already out there, then what's the blackmail good for? You were all very, very specifically intent on wanting to get it on the television.
3613.44 3619.68 speaker1  that was more valuable than a letter of recommendation from Cal Colorado?
3619.12 3628.08 speaker4  Oh, what? Five. Yeah. 27.
3627.12 3631.92 speaker1  Negative 90. 11. Okay.
3629.28 3639.36 speaker4  Put a million on the end of any of those except for the negative one, because I don't know how that would work out. And then yeah, that's probably like on the table.
3636.72 3642.34 speaker1  You would owe him then if it was a negative probably.
3641.84 3663.36 speaker4  No. and get him to like fuck off, but maybe not.
3663.12 3679.44 speaker1  Yeah. I think in that case, you would just blackmail him to have the company, not for a number that would then be enough to buy it from him.
3678.24 3692.08 speaker4  How much should I ask for?
3689.84 3700.64 speaker1  Well, what is he worth?
3700.40 3710.24 speaker4  Bill.
3710.00 3733.04 speaker1  No. No. I want to human that.
3729.36 3743.68 speaker2  stripped them down to their veneer by asking the question. And you can just see right through a very simple like, no, that hasn't happened yet.
3741.84 3768.48 speaker1  Like, did you know the cops? The cops, by the way, did you know that? Well, see, it hasn't even happened yet. I'd like a sidebar with Beck. Just do like a really tiny one in your seat there.
3768.16 3780.16 speaker3  Okay.
3774.80 3801.28 speaker2  like I didn't have you roll grip in the moment and that starting to feel a little bit. Pass.
3799.04 3846.80 speaker1  I pass a 25 on a 49. Yeah. That makes way more sense than mine. Like what are those in the fluid?
3844.64 3855.60 speaker2  Like aggressive attack VR. That's awesome.
3852.88 3887.76 speaker1  You know how they film the Mandalorian on that circular green screen? Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. That's I don't think that they have that like here, but that sounds like a Grover's Gorge kind of thing. Exactly. It was wild. Remember what they did? You know, when you got jackaloped? Yeah. Picture right up. Deck feels his backside. Yeah. I remember.
3881.04 3893.68 speaker2  And Stevie just kind of like slips out of the Mercedes Cadillac. And Stevie just kind of slips out of the Cadillac at this point. What's it for fucking Mercedes?
3893.04 3904.16 speaker1  Other way around. Okay. Gotcha. Of this.
3903.04 3905.36 speaker4  What kind of car is this?
3904.16 3978.08 speaker1  It's a Mercedes C class. Cool. Yeah. Which Luke assured us was nice. Okay. So we slip out of the car, but back since we lost sight of Stevie. So easily a few minutes ago is going to like be staring into the back seat as we talk. I think. Yeah. gone so far about like how we physically get it back. Like they probably got guns, dude. And they're expecting Stevie. So we probably need to stay out of sight though for the handoff, right? the footage and showing the public is if for now we let Stevie believe that they can go through with the blackmail. Yeah.
3977.84 3983.44 speaker2  car. You're in the car. God damn it.
3981.84 4012.48 speaker1  You are where we can see you. It's really smart. Pop his head in. Were you going to pay them money or how are you going to get the stuff from them? Exactly. Yeah. You're like the next higher up that they're passing it on to.
4012.24 4014.32 speaker4  Fuck.
4013.60 4040.24 speaker1  Beck looks around. Like the south gate? Yeah, the south gate. Oh, the people's gate. We're going to let you carry out your blackmail. What? Really? We think it's for the good of the people. Okay. Yeah.
4038.64 4048.88 speaker4  You guys get a exclusive.
4048.40 4067.92 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. Real hard. Yeah. It's hot.
4066.40 4096.56 speaker1  So the fucking discord doesn't. And even though what we're saying is funny right now, please cut it. Because I'm serious about those discord fucks.
4096.32 4127.12 speaker2  Back. Do you want to try to bait him?
4121.04 4153.36 speaker1  That even though you could read into it some other way, what we have here is a father son type dynamic. For sure. For sure. For sure. I'm the daddy. So now it's in your hands, Zach. What you unleash on the world.
4152.00 4160.48 speaker2  On the edit, baby. It's on the edit. We'll see.
4159.12 4190.56 speaker1  You're going to, you have to meet them. Stevie, Stevie, you're not stupid. You're just at the beginning of your life and you've got a lot to learn. Yeah. But I believe in you, kiddo. That's awesome.
4188.00 4201.76 speaker4  Okay, well, do you guys want to like come with me or?
4195.76 4209.44 speaker1  FaceTime us from your phone pocket or something or from your shirt pocket with your phone in it.
4206.24 4224.88 speaker4  So like that's, that's kind of my steez, right? So like, they're not going to know that.
4222.88 4245.36 speaker1  They say like kids say it. Like we say it.
4241.92 4279.68 speaker2  inside this parking garage and pull up next to you. Well, how much do you know about? Julia Summers? No.
4279.20 4289.20 speaker1  Absolutely. This is Jeremy.
4288.80 4294.56 speaker2  Oh no. I'm just going to wait for Luke to like describe what you guys see as sitting shotgun.
4294.24 4319.20 speaker1  Hell yeah.
4313.60 4333.14 speaker2  And pulling up is the car of Jeremy, the city action news intern. He's driving and sitting shotgun. What do they see?
4332.64 4369.52 speaker3  Thanks. Slams the door and goes to get in the back seat of Cal's car. What? You got promotions. I got promotions.
4367.20 4377.12 speaker1  What's the, yeah, Julius, you are. Oh, there's a lot of viscera on you.
4376.40 4378.90 speaker3  It got all wet.
4378.40 4391.44 speaker1  What? Yeah. Blood fountain? That's blood, dude. Are you hurt?
4388.56 4399.12 speaker3  My face hurts a little bit, but I'm good.
4397.44 4402.56 speaker1  No wounds or injury.
4399.20 4410.16 speaker3  You can't really, you wouldn't really be able to tell through the blood. Yeah.
4403.12 4420.40 speaker2  And he seems to be, maybe there's like a hole in his shoulder and he's probably like kind of holding it just a little bit.
4419.36 4421.04 speaker1  Yeah, it'll be fun.
4420.40 4442.88 speaker3  From water? From the fountain.
4442.16 4444.88 speaker2  Holy shit.
4444.24 4508.40 speaker1  Holy shit. And you said pieces of viscera, like brain? Yeah. Wow. Wow. It's all mine for, cause my life is great.
4505.12 4514.48 speaker3  That was like an Andrew Dice Clay crowd shot.
4513.44 4541.60 speaker1  He made his mistake.
4541.20 4549.84 speaker0  Wow.
4547.36 4560.56 speaker2  We've, we've been through a lot and it's been a while. And last we left you, we left you on a bit of a cliffhanger, but let's not talk about that. We just did four full episodes as different characters.
4559.44 4564.80 speaker1  I don't know if it's the headphones. You sound crazy blown out to me.
4563.36 4578.72 speaker3  So you might want to check that before we. I was trying to think of words that rhymed with all your names.
4577.52 4582.72 speaker1  That's as far as I got. Okay, well let's go to Thomas.
4582.48 4606.96 speaker3  Right.
4605.28 4626.02 speaker2  It was like Michael unicycle. I was taking inspiration from the man himself. He just said, have you ever seen Michael? Unicycle. Promise.
4625.52 4631.84 speaker3  Okay.
4631.12 4636.24 speaker1  Dude, I don't know. My last name is a lot more. I mean your whole. Oh, right.
4634.32 4646.88 speaker2  That would have been the move. Can't think of anything that rhymes with that either. I saw.
4646.08 4651.36 speaker1  Getting off his rocks. Getting off. Yeah. You can play around with all that. Yeah.
4650.32 4653.92 speaker3  Down by the bay.
4653.76 4672.56 speaker2  Yeah. Except for me. I'm attacking a rat. Oh, is that code? Is that euphemism? No, no, no, no. We were just attacking the rat. You got to do me now.
4672.08 4681.68 speaker1  Oh no. Never eat the beach.
4679.68 4685.44 speaker3  Down by the bay.
4682.64 4710.96 speaker1  And it's all my fault.
4707.04 4797.68 speaker3  stumbled across a female Meowth when he was young and fell head over heels for her. She didn't return his affection though because she had a rich trainer and said Meowth and He learned to walk on two legs by watching people practice at a local dance academy, which also just so happens to offer pronunciation lessons over time. And with a little help from a picture book, he learned to sound out words. Unfortunately, that didn't impress the female Meowth who went so far as to call him a freak. A broken hearted Meowth eventually left to join team Rocket because Rocket was the first word he ever understood the meaning of. According to the logic of this episode then, there isn't anything special about Meowth that makes them able to talk to humans. Theoretically, any Pokemon that is able to speak their own name articulately could learn our language. They just need the proper motivation, a little help, and a lot of determination. and that might have just been a hallucination. the Detective Pikachu movie.
4792.56 4804.08 speaker2  Because romantic love was the only thing to drive a Pokemon previously to learn English. I don't think he was.
4800.32 4847.76 speaker3  But then again, having more Pokemon speak like humans would probably run some of the magic of the franchise. It's part of the series charm that they can only say their names. It also makes Meowth special. Of course, maybe Pikachu doesn't care about Ash as much as Team Rocket's Meowth cared about the other Meowth. Yeah, that was written by Seamus Kelly. Radio Hedge Fund, nice, says it does also make Team Rocket idiots. They want to capture a nondescript Pikachu because he is in some way special, and yet they have a talking Meowth. This little guy is beyond special, and yet they mistreat him all the time. Chris says, Slowking also spoke in Pokemon 2000. Dude, I'm so Slowking stoked for this episode we're about to record.
