0.00 124.56 speaker0  What's up, my babies? It's your handler, your GM, your BM, which stands for Best, May, and Never Your DM, because if I'm in a dungeon, I am most assuredly not the master. It's Zach. I'm Zach. I am Zach. We have a special bonus episode this week, because this is the end of an era. This is the last episode of Pretending to Be People that will be released on a Monday, because in 2020, we are switching our release day to Friday. So the next episode will be out next year on Friday, January 3rd. But this episode right here? This episode right here is special. It's a bonus. This is the first episode we made for the Patreon. It's a Q&A from back in May. This is a taste of what our honorary police officers have access to for $5 a month. Wolf has an intro to this episode, so I won't keep you for much longer, but go to your Google Cal, put a horny emoji on every Friday in 2020, and enjoy this Q&A episode. Also, thank you so much for listening, and every time we get to interact with y'all on the internet, it makes my heart warm, and every time I see fanart on Instagram or over on the subreddit, it makes my heart heart okay. I love you. Okay, bye. Welcome, friends, to the nastiest radio show this side of the city. Y'all know I'm all about that nasty. This is 694.2 PTBP, contention's greasiest and grimiest radio show, hosted by me, Wolf the dog. Y'all know I'm such a nasty boy. Now, what ain't nasty is that y'all have been helping support us
117.60 240.08 speaker1  some tasty meat slop. We have yet another special presentation here on PTBP for y'all. We got y'all, there are spoilers abound here, so make sure you are caught up with what they're putting down before you take a listen. Now, it's time for this new band I heard to dish out some hot
234.96 265.92 speaker0  Is he dead now? He's dead now. He died of brain cancer. Yeah, so now then, I guess, probably.
258.96 298.56 speaker2  anything before 93. Luke, you don't think of anything before 93 minutes ago. Ouch. Boom. He got you. That's not true. I could tell you all about podcasts that I listen to. Unnamed podcast. I know every episode. Oh, God. Okay, yeah. Rhymes with gum frown. Oof. All right. Hey, I don't listen to that.
291.76 313.60 speaker0  thinks it's doing it ironically. All right. Welcome to the Patreon for pretending to be people.
309.68 341.20 speaker2  fuck all the other people that listen to this podcast except you guys.
335.68 403.20 speaker0  will you tell me what was up with that jump scare? I'm spooked and I can't shake it. Well, tonight. And they said, okay, it's a deal. It's a done deal. It was a pact. We made a blood pact here's what happened. We were in the room recording that episode and in the middle of the
395.52 424.40 speaker2  of a reaction is because our reaction was not audio quality reaction. It was just,
416.24 458.88 speaker0  it sounded even crazier on the podcast is the magic of audio editing. A little behind the scenes here, basically what I did was I layered my scream on top of itself three times and I changed up the interval just a little bit. That way I wasn't at the exact same time each time. And then I modulated
454.00 478.32 speaker2  questions as to what that was. That was just Marvin getting very angry. He got upset and he
472.48 495.68 speaker0  crazy good at voices or is there a modulator in there? And the answer is I am very. Both. but in between like it's all my voice. That's just an old audio pro term.
493.84 524.40 speaker2  In the biz, you know. In the biz. Zach, could you do your best voice of anything for us right now? Oh yeah, obviously. Give us your Schwarzenegger.
523.92 621.12 speaker0  Too far. all the time for us. He's a total goofball in the best way possible and I love him to death. And he did Mickey Mouse and Goofy and Elmo. And it was always, I mean, in the morning it'd be, The Donald Trump. I tried that in my whole childhood. Thomas can actually do a solid machine gun with his mouth. And I haven't gotten him to do the Foley work on the podcast yet, but one of these days he'll get some extra
618.56 645.44 speaker2  Yeah, we'll do Michael, right? Is that right?
642.16 690.72 speaker0  what I mean is right before we started recording and we all said, oh wow, this is a good conversation that we should have had on microphone. Let's go for it. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. different character with the voices, Joe? I'm not playing a different character.
685.68 721.44 speaker3  If I have to do a new character voice. I don't know what I'll do. I have a bad habit of slipping down into my Southern accent no matter what character I play. So I'm going to try and actively fight against that, but we'll see what happens. Do you think that's based on your roots? I reckon so.
720.48 740.80 speaker2  It comes back around. The thing is, once I started doing this podcast, it's kind of like just slipped in to my everyday life. Like I've started just talking like Keith. That's crazy, man. That's insane.
739.68 750.08 speaker3  You got to shake off the character.
744.40 755.20 speaker2  voice for the next character, which I mean to, I mean, to the Patreon subscribers, you,
750.08 762.72 speaker3  you know, this is just for you, but my normal talking voice is a little bit like this. And I ain't like talking like this.
762.16 771.04 speaker2  Honestly.
770.56 777.76 speaker0  does. Yeah. But I don't know.
772.32 795.68 speaker2  We tested it with some audiences and it really didn't go over well.
795.44 799.12 speaker0  Yeah.
798.32 838.00 speaker2  That reminds me. I haven't owned a toothbrush in so long. I really need to go buy one. How do you brush your teeth? I don't. Oh no. They do say that. You want to kiss me? My mouth is cleaner than a toilet.
834.64 854.32 speaker0  Wolf, the dog, not being the radio DJ. When we went to the city, Justin, what are you going to do if the story leaves contention forever? Yeah. Wolf just moves to the city. Right.
854.00 856.08 speaker2  Yeah.
854.32 871.60 speaker3  He expands his empire. Yeah.
871.36 887.68 speaker0  Yeah. And he's an influencer on social media. Yeah. Oh no.
885.60 891.44 speaker3  Well, everyone's like, fuck that weird voice.
890.72 899.76 speaker1  More Steve.
895.76 920.48 speaker3  They were, they were caught up in listening and they just, uh, recently gave us another little shout out saying they were kind of catching up and caught up. And one of the hosts, this is the ugly mugs podcast. Oh yeah.
915.44 927.68 speaker0  So that actually came about because we were hanging out of the house one day playing a
927.28 934.32 speaker2  Yeah.
927.68 966.96 speaker0  I think we, uh, like that's a single page role playing game that we like to do when we're just hanging out on a Saturday. The games take what? Like an hour, hour and a half. Uh, but in the middle of that game, Justin just started speaking exactly like Wolf, the dog, and then immediately named the character in that improv. And I looked at him and I was like, Justin, this is a thing.
966.40 977.20 speaker2  Oh yeah. We were just like, this is going to be on the show.
970.72 994.16 speaker0  And honestly, I think that had a lot to do with how we figured out how to put an intro onto the show. And we wanted to do a previously on, but I knew how much work the editing was just to edit a show and put it out every week. I really didn't want to put together a previous.
990.16 1000.08 speaker2  Come through the whole fucking episode, looking for clips and like, yeah.
994.16 1009.76 speaker0  And so we, uh, we kind of talked to Justin and I and came up with, uh, with the radio station.
1005.28 1024.16 speaker2  to than a, here's the thing that you like, especially if you're binging a show, it's
1021.04 1046.88 speaker3  Like I'm, I wasn't involved in those recordings initially. So it's really fun for me to get like, as a huge narcissist who loves to hear them. Oh yeah. help out with the podcast and like any way that I could.
1046.56 1055.28 speaker1  Yeah.
1054.00 1064.00 speaker3  But he's kind of this other world.
1060.16 1076.48 speaker2  And you're like, you're like an, like a, almost like a godlike character where you're like, it's like, how the fuck do you know?
1072.24 1085.28 speaker1  actually get revealed, but we have like all this weird like character history for him and it's real goofy and fun.
1079.04 1109.76 speaker0  It's necessary in order for us to, uh, to, to get just all up inside Wolf the dog every week. So that kind of leads us into, uh, BFEvans19 wrote, uh, have you ever, have any of you ever played any interesting systems other than Delta Green or Pulp Cthulhu? No. And the answer is no, no.
1107.20 1138.56 speaker2  I don't know that I ever want to play D&D again. No. time, but it's like, it's a different game. It's so different than Delta Green where it's like, you know, you are just like in, everybody's involved the whole time. And then with Pathfinder, it's like, I am having fun playing it and like when it's my turn, it's, be careful. He's listening. Right. Shout out to Andy. Thank you Andy for running Pathfinder. Oh, sorry.
1138.24 1144.32 speaker3  Docs. Who lives that?
1141.04 1156.00 speaker2  Andy, after we finished this, let's play Delta Green.
1154.48 1157.52 speaker0  to have a relaxed afternoon.
1156.00 1165.76 speaker2  And that one is so much fun. It's a really fun game. Yeah.
1161.68 1167.28 speaker3  Besides Dungeons and Dragons and Delta Green, the only campaign I've gone through.
1166.56 1198.80 speaker2  What was that called? The Sion with Zach and Justin. And you play there too. Yeah.
1198.16 1209.92 speaker0  Yeah.
1205.68 1229.28 speaker1  little like, I think the gameplay in the system can be a little, eh, like it gets like, you can kind of get OP really quickly. Um, but the like character creation and the thought you put into like having this. What did you play? Oh, it might've been Saddam. Was it both?
1228.08 1236.72 speaker3  I can't remember.
1233.68 1257.84 speaker1  But I also had all these, we, the powers were really interesting. And what was your, your God? I think. I don't remember.
1257.04 1272.56 speaker0  I played in offspring. I played the band, the offspring played in the band, the offspring. And, uh, I played a son of Dionysus who was a drunk priest. That was a, that one was really fun.
1268.56 1302.88 speaker2  I played a son of Apollo, I think, or Hermes. I don't remember who was just David Bowie basically. It was a lot of fun. The streets are gray.
1298.64 1312.16 speaker3  Uh, what was that system that we did a one shot one day of where you play heightened versions of yourselves? That was a lot of fun. Yeah.
1310.88 1314.80 speaker0  Dude, I have no idea. We need to look that up right now.
1314.24 1334.40 speaker2  I gotta pee.
1332.16 1356.08 speaker0  When daddy's away, Junior will play.
1354.32 1373.12 speaker3  You know what I'm talking about. I'll be spinning the freshest cuts and selling my proprietary jewel blend while supplies last. So come on down to Al's Tires this Saturday only.
1371.76 1378.48 speaker0  Product has changed my life.
1373.12 1397.20 speaker2  I was really excited that we had, uh, that product on this time because that is one that legitimately like I, on a daily basis, think about or use. Well, like product in my toes, product in my hair, product in your ears. Don't put things in your ears, but product goes everywhere.
1396.08 1407.84 speaker3  I think I'm going to up the order. Oh yeah.
1407.04 1418.80 speaker0  Spicy. Uh, we played, I think there's six different variants on it. I just remembered it. Yeah. We just remembered. Yeah.
1417.68 1419.68 speaker2  We didn't have to look that up.
1418.80 1428.24 speaker0  Great memories. And it is called the end of the world. Thomas was right. You get a five points of luck.
1426.16 1433.04 speaker3  I'm writing that down.
1432.88 1440.40 speaker2  Yeah.
1436.32 1469.44 speaker0  Joe, you were the one who brought that up that day where we played the, uh, the bigger versions of ourselves where we actually, the stats on that game are built by making what you think are the stats for yourself. And then the group votes on whether or not you are right. I forgot about that part. Uh, we just up stats, right? Like typically that's what we do. Yeah.
1469.20 1480.08 speaker2  Yeah.
1478.00 1491.28 speaker3  work this way, but you play heightened versions of yourself. And then we played, uh, that we were in our town. So it was like, we went over to so-and-so's brother's house that we all have been to before.
1491.04 1501.36 speaker2  Yeah.
1494.88 1513.76 speaker0  And then, uh, we actually moved pretty quickly to our friend Jake's house and Jake was on the podcast. He played a young Ferguson beans. Rest in peace.
1508.80 1523.20 speaker2  Also, Jake's backyard neighbor is Justin's brother. Yes. And we started our zombie story by making him the first infected, basically. Oh, that's right. The first one we saw.
1521.84 1536.64 speaker0  Ryan shout out to Ryan. Everyone has a Ryan Sala and Ryan Sala runs our local gaming store called meta games here in Springfield.
1535.04 1557.20 speaker2  Meta games has been very good to us. And Ryan, that will cost you $25 for that. Also shout out to Jake's vegan burgers. That's another 25. We just made $50 this episode.
1552.08 1560.80 speaker0  And actually about, uh, three quarters of the way through that game, we took a little, uh, we took a little detour. Oh yeah.
1560.08 1569.28 speaker3  Yeah. What was it?
1567.76 1585.86 speaker2  Oh, I was there for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who is also named Jake.
1585.36 1591.36 speaker3  Yes.
1590.96 1594.64 speaker2  Yeah.
1593.84 1617.28 speaker0  They knew. Why yes, Zach. I have.
1615.84 1632.08 speaker1  a big fan of. Um, I was actually running a campaign for some friends that, uh, crumbled spectacularly. If I may say so myself, uh, probably in ways that people can guess.
1630.40 1633.60 speaker2  Or am I confusing it with something else?
1632.48 1644.16 speaker1  It's easy. All the roles are like, are pretty simplistic. Uh, I haven't done, I actually forgot what the, you basically always roll the same, like, is it like two dice?
1643.12 1649.92 speaker0  Two D six, I think. Is that a powered by the apocalypse game? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah.
1648.16 1655.44 speaker1  I think it's savage world.
1653.60 1659.14 speaker0  Those are all powered by the apocalypse.
1658.64 1688.64 speaker1  Okay. But it was, it was so fun. Like it was my first time getting to host something. And this, like you guys said, like with D and D stuff, sometimes you wait for your turn and it's just like, there's so many things you have to think about. Whereas dungeon world is so fucking get that, like, let's, let's make this story happen. Let's do this shit instead of like, okay, get your rule books out and look at all your numbers and everything.
1686.96 1700.16 speaker0  is John as a friend group. Uh, we've had, I, I've gotten to play and I believe Thomas has run. Everyone has run one. Yeah.
1696.88 1701.22 speaker2  Did you do the underwater F1 thing? Yeah.
1700.72 1703.60 speaker3  Yeah.
1702.24 1712.32 speaker0  And Luke, did you run one?
1710.48 1728.56 speaker2  like ran a game before. and then you just have to wing it. And it was, it was fun.
1724.48 1736.40 speaker3  You, you, you, you set out a few goals for yourself and then have fun.
1734.56 1741.04 speaker2  Did we talk about how everyone is John works?
1737.60 1755.76 speaker0  But if you want to hop into it, be my guest. Well, so literally everyone is John.
1749.92 1784.88 speaker2  And before you start playing the game, you set specific goals for John and try to two specific goals for John and you try to meet them sometimes as many times as you can.
1784.40 1792.64 speaker0  Yeah. And we all try to win a medal.
1786.64 1799.76 speaker2  Also like whoever's running the game tries to, you know, get everybody to get, meet those goals. Like there's one, what you, somebody wanted to play with the Beatles. Was that you Joe?
1798.08 1815.92 speaker3  So you kind of set up the goals. You have one that seems impossible and then you have one that you can kind of do on a repeated basis. So mine was, I, it was to play in the Beatles was my unreachable goal. And then I think the other one was to steal stuff or something like that.
1814.32 1816.48 speaker2  You've got corn dogs or something.
1815.92 1831.28 speaker3  Something like that. I just tried to steal stuff as I made my way toward the stage that Thomas had created where the Beatles were having a reunion concert. I tried to get John there.
1829.76 1851.20 speaker2  at like sucking on stuff. Yeah.
1850.56 1855.68 speaker0  Use your mouth.
1852.08 1859.76 speaker2  I think Jake had one that was like, he just wanted to like drink milk. Milk. Yeah.
1858.16 1861.52 speaker3  That was the one that won, right?
1860.48 1866.16 speaker2  Drink a lot of milk.
1862.40 1871.68 speaker3  Well, no, because other people kept drinking things that had milk in them somehow. Like, Oh yeah.
1867.60 1874.96 speaker1  Cause if other people achieve your goal, then you hit the point for it.
1874.72 1878.88 speaker2  Yeah.
1877.60 1887.76 speaker0  Latte based. So, um, we've got another, uh, we've got another question here from Limey Well. Uh, I think it was on Twitter.
1886.56 1892.56 speaker2  Got a Tinder match. Oh, congratulations.
1891.04 1893.44 speaker0  Let's hear that bio. Yeah.
1892.72 1923.12 speaker2  Let's look at this. Well, I, uh, today, earlier in the day, it said I had a free boost. So I've been matching with a lot of people. You've been like matching like crazy. Uh, it's a fun name. Just the quintessential goth girlfriend. E-girl TM. New to Missouri as of five 27. Show me what you got.
1921.76 1929.52 speaker0  notes when it's complete?
1929.28 1942.64 speaker3  Yeah.
1941.84 1950.88 speaker0  in the campaign?
1949.20 1958.16 speaker2  my vans at your house. Yeah.
1955.60 1993.44 speaker0  my shoes are trying to see those toes, baby. If there's interest, uh, when this, uh, when this, uh, first arc, a story arc with these characters of this campaign is finished, I'll, I'll probably type up something and, uh, send it off or just self publish it. If, if that's something people are interested in, for those of you listening, you would be the ones who had, who would probably get it.
1991.36 2005.60 speaker2  Does he mean typing up this campaign?
1998.32 2017.60 speaker0  and the characters in the town and then, uh, some sort of, uh, a chain of events with, Exactly. And then, and then you would all have to do with that what you will. Cause that's what I'm doing.
2017.12 2018.88 speaker2  Yeah, man.
2018.40 2030.96 speaker0  Oh God. And, uh, yeah, no, I, I, that would be extremely fascinating. Oh, that would be super cool.
2030.08 2033.44 speaker3  Yeah, absolutely.
2030.96 2064.96 speaker0  That would be extremely interesting to me. Um, let's see, we've got another one here. I don't know how to pronounce this. It's a user on Reddit. It's a J O R S E S H O. Jors is ho. Like horses ho, Jors is ho. I don't know. Uh, Jors ho, Jors show, Jors show. How do you determine the mental disorders the guys suffer from? It's a really good question. And it, uh, it took some balance here. We just add the ones from our own lives.
2061.52 2082.72 speaker3  Uh, has, since I don't listen to the other guys stuff, do they, does the audience know all of our disorders?
2077.20 2100.24 speaker0  Basically I met with each of you individually and we had a quick conversation about it where I told you what I was thinking, a base outline for what the disorder would be. And you said yes or no. I can't remember how that went down, but we muddled it and whittled it down to something that we could play with.
2098.24 2109.36 speaker3  happened to give us that sanity loss. Right.
2105.68 2129.84 speaker0  character, Dr. Denny Dennison, AKA worm fingers. He had a, I had a scat fetish, a scat fetish, a debilitating scat fetish. Do you actually remember, I remember the clue that led you to become infatuated with the
2127.92 2136.00 speaker2  a clue or to find something. Yeah.
2135.68 2140.64 speaker3  point.
2136.00 2154.88 speaker2  So I developed a scat fetish and you know what? I really ran with it on that one. You sure did.
2149.20 2182.08 speaker0  you guys had, uh, the spawn of an elder God inside of you in the form of these little white gooby spiders. And Luke's character was bent over the toilet puking spiders like these like goopy monsters into the toilet when he saw a note. But a previous character maybe hadn't flushed when he rolled poorly or something.
2180.24 2206.56 speaker2  And then, um, you know what? It was really the perfect thing for that character to have developed. Don't let Keith die.
2205.60 2215.04 speaker0  Joe, what were you saying?
2212.00 2223.12 speaker3  to the breaking point and I just was scared of kids from that point on. Children. It doesn't always have to be as gross as scat fetish.
2221.04 2233.68 speaker2  I would say that children are just as gross.
2230.32 2256.48 speaker3  acting that out, but I just kind of ran into a group of kids in an alley one time. So when you hit your breaking point, sometimes you don't have any control over what your character does. And so I, uh, ended up running the opposite direction and like across town and away from you guys, I didn't get to be part of whatever was going on for a few minutes.
2252.08 2278.24 speaker2  That campaign was really cool because we passed through this, a very creepy town in Arkansas coming back from a show we had seen Zach and I, uh, and another friend of ours.
2277.60 2286.32 speaker0  Harmon town.
2282.24 2304.08 speaker2  I don't know, man, but we were going through the alienate any harmonians. No, of course.
2299.04 2307.44 speaker3  But no, Harmon town was one of the things that brought, uh, Zach and I that got us interested in roleplaying.
2305.44 2313.04 speaker2  Have you guys ever watched Rick and Morty?
2311.60 2324.56 speaker0  Harmon quest was awesome. I really enjoyed it. So, uh, we were on our way back from Arkansas and went through this super creepy town.
2324.16 2327.20 speaker3  Yeah. And it worked.
2325.44 2335.92 speaker0  It was super, it was super fun.
2331.60 2355.68 speaker2  Was it a different one where it was like the, uh, the church put on the Halloween? Okay.
2349.44 2384.32 speaker0  of Jackson Elias podcast and actually fucking huge shout out to Scott Dorward because when I was running Helen Texas during that campaign, I posted on the call of Cthulhu subreddit and I got some awesome responses from people who had also run that scenario. could finish up that scenario in a, uh, in a really interesting and a horrifying way.
2382.24 2386.00 speaker3  And I remember I came to you guys, I was like, Oh my God. No.
2384.72 2392.48 speaker0  You were very excited.
2387.52 2405.92 speaker2  Reddit is obviously the best and worst website in the world because you can create anything on there.
2403.04 2414.00 speaker0  specifically is so fantastic. Actually. Um, yeah, that Scott Dor that, that freaked me out and I got so giddy, but then I was in my kitchen. That was years ago, right?
2412.88 2430.00 speaker2  We were just dorks.
2427.52 2507.84 speaker0  which I've been listening to for years now. And they started talking about pretending to be people and I lost my shit. Yeah. Incredible. But speaking of the people within this, uh, within this hobby being fantastic humans, uh, one of the guys who is very responsible for Delta green, the role playing game, becoming a game, his name is, uh, Dennis debt Willer. And I was writing a paper for my undergrad about why role playing games are a positive influence on both the individual and society. And I needed to interview someone. thinking that, uh, he would, he would respond. I emailed a bunch of different people because he was one of the creators of Delta green, the game that is the only game that I've ever run and obsessed over. And he responded like so quickly with these amazing in depth responses. And it blew me away. And I didn't even realize when I asked for some of his credentials, uh, he was, uh, he was the artist of, he was one of the artists for the original magic, the gathering. No way. Oh, so that's a cool card game. Yeah.
2507.52 2512.48 speaker3  Yeah.
2509.04 2544.00 speaker0  I think he worked for Marvel, uh, for a while. And what is Marvel? And he's, he's done some interviews on some podcasts recently that have been so fun to listen to and really in depth. Um, yeah. Shout out to Dennis. He's, he's doing just amazing work and keeping the game that we love alive. Dennis. Dennis.
2543.60 2560.24 speaker2  Yeah.
2556.08 2561.44 speaker3  Like guideline for if you want to make your players terrified.
2560.80 2565.52 speaker2  Yeah, man.
2562.64 2576.48 speaker0  I know we don't play the, uh, the rules as written in this. So, uh, your characters, uh, are a little bit, uh, heartier than they would be in Delta green. But we still just, and we also,
2575.04 2584.48 speaker3  Which is why Pope Cthulhu was made.
2579.28 2599.76 speaker0  And like we, we also in the past, you know, have played as government agency, you know, members before, but for the podcast, wanted to do a little something different. So we are playing a, uh, a, a outside of the normal realm of Delta green and this whole, and this whole campaign.
2594.72 2606.88 speaker1  Like, um, I don't, were you in those Delta green sessions where just people would drop like flies with me whenever we first started?
2602.08 2612.96 speaker0  Justin, when we first started, I went through three characters in three games.
2607.20 2627.28 speaker1  I, I remember just like having a character that survived like three sessions and being like, I can't die. something wrong and you're fucking gone. Yeah.
2627.04 2631.36 speaker0  Yeah.
2627.28 2658.80 speaker1  Cause you're just out survived to one other person and it's like, I guess I'm the veteran.
2656.32 2676.48 speaker3  the first one I played, I think we didn't win. Right. Oh, or did I just get too drunk? No. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
2669.44 2709.84 speaker2  Well cause yeah, like the losing upward doctor, the doctor Denny, Dr Denny Dennison one. I ended up becoming like a, a servant to the demon. Yes. Yeah. Any new players to Delta green?
2706.16 2710.72 speaker3  If you find yourself bobbing in spiders, it's, I might be, I heard.
2709.84 2722.24 speaker0  Don't say his name.
2718.48 2800.08 speaker3  advertisement on this radio station ostensibly from Al's tires. He will no longer be watching Al's tires on Saturdays unsupervised. Several weeks ago, my beloved wife Molly suggested I take out a local radio advertisement. So for the next few weeks, we're going to do a little less talking and take some more
2789.04 2820.00 speaker0  Rinafiron asks, are there different classes? It seems magic is available in this world. Did the boys just choose not to go down that road with these characters? I'm going to let you guys field this one because we've, this is our third campaign together and we have some experience with this.
2818.72 2826.08 speaker3  This is actually a question for you, Zach. Is it available from the outset? You kind of have to find it as a character, don't you?
2825.04 2830.56 speaker2  And that's fun.
2828.88 2842.08 speaker3  Is there a mechanic for it to start out with? Can you find it to start?
2835.92 2863.76 speaker0  You can take a, uh, from the top, you can have an experience with the unnatural. However, we have never played that way.
2859.52 2865.92 speaker2  You're the only one, as far as I can remember, you're the only one that has used magic.
2863.76 2877.92 speaker3  And it was a pretty long process and it was cool. Zach made, literally, he handed me at our friend Jake's, uh, pizza night. Pizza night?
2876.80 2881.44 speaker2  Jake's vegan burgers.
2880.40 2900.24 speaker3  Get the total. This hand drawn little notebook with all these symbols and like weird incantations in it and shit. And like, it was awesome. And he just like, he handed it to me silently. He's like, it's like, you know what this is? And I was like, I don't know what this is.
2898.96 2915.04 speaker0  I remember that so clearly. So the, uh, call of Cthulhu put out a supplement called the grimoire, the grand grimoire.
2913.92 2927.12 speaker3  not a Delta green mechanic.
2920.16 2962.00 speaker0  And it has every single spell that has been used in a call of Cthulhu scenario in the book alphabetized and ready to go. And so I went through it and I found ones that I thought fit into the campaign that we were currently running at the time. And what I did with it is I buried it in the grave of Joe's character's brother. And that character, the brother was still alive. And Thomas's character found the book in that grave. Thus learning that Joe's character's brother was still alive.
2960.00 2978.40 speaker3  And that was still a closed game at the time. So we did that in game. It was real, it was real cool.
2972.24 3033.60 speaker0  as the terminology goes in Delta green within the, uh, within the lore of the system, there are two factions of Delta green. There's the cowboys and the program. And the cowboys are these, uh, these guys who've been doing this forever, who have the cells, a cell B cell all the way down. And they are there to protect the world from the mythos. And then, uh, basically the program was this Delta green, uh, organization, basically the ones who were brought over from majestic 12, which is an organization within the original Delta green game. the leader of the opposition group. And they found out that he was alive and they found this spell book. So, uh, Thomas was allowed these, like, I think I gave you like eight spells.
3030.32 3036.48 speaker2  Cause you had to do something in order to cast the spell, right?
3033.60 3052.96 speaker3  They cost, I think willpower and some other things.
3050.88 3069.04 speaker0  I remember, I remember the scene so well. was some sign we saw in this like seemingly abandoned town in Arkansas. Oh yeah.
3067.60 3077.60 speaker3  That's exactly what it said.
3073.36 3084.48 speaker0  And so I immediately was like, Oh, going to go into that for our game.
3084.08 3098.08 speaker2  Yeah.
3094.40 3130.32 speaker0  um, tainted, uh, creature at this point. And she had trapped them and Thomas tries to pull off the spell and rolls a fucking crit fail.
3125.60 3138.32 speaker3  to dust, just my whole arm turned to dust and it was gone. Yeah. Yeah.
3137.84 3155.52 speaker2  Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
3150.08 3166.96 speaker0  uh, one of my favorite role playing nights of all time was actually just Thomas and I sitting at my kitchen table. And that character had just gotten this spell book that, you know, that he had found and
3166.56 3176.80 speaker3  Yeah. To try to experiment with some of the spells.
3176.32 3187.04 speaker0  Dr. Richard Ryland.
3186.16 3200.08 speaker1  She's very ill.
3199.92 3211.04 speaker3  Yeah. They just kind of had, um, fuck. I don't, I don't remember.
3209.68 3225.60 speaker0  I'm sure I still have it somewhere. Yeah. They had obtuse and vague names for the spells and then light directions. So very much so. So he didn't necessarily know what they were going to do, but what he did do was go out
3225.12 3228.64 speaker1  Dr.
3228.40 3244.80 speaker2  Yeah.
3244.16 3281.52 speaker0  of the deer. And, uh, it was one of the most fucked up and horrifying nights of role playing I've was playing these Call of Cthulhu characters basically who were stuck in the woods with a goddamn sorcerer.
3278.56 3295.12 speaker2  I killed three teenagers.
3290.64 3312.40 speaker0  lost the spell that you lost your arm to, you use that to disintegrate them. So the teens didn't get away.
3309.84 3325.12 speaker3  I don't know if I succeeded in that one or if that's where I lost my arm.
3320.16 3337.76 speaker2  I don't know why, but like for some reason we were found out of all the shit that we had been doing. Yeah.
3331.20 3358.08 speaker0  to happen in the games because it's so much fun and like the more fun shit that happens, the better the game is in my opinion. And I'm not going to step in your way.
3356.00 3382.00 speaker2  I mean, I say you don't do this often. You do it very sparingly, but it's like, the only times you say no is when I'm saying something and I'm like, there's no way that he says yes to this. I'm like, okay.
3381.44 3386.80 speaker3  brother. Cause I was like kind of fuzzy on those events and I was like, wait, what happened with all
3386.32 3397.60 speaker2  that?
3393.28 3417.36 speaker3  Then you try to go back through this automatic door and Zach's like, you prop that open, right? He didn't just say like, you can't get back in. to just get to keep murdering his brother and that woman.
3413.44 3420.08 speaker2  I would have found a way around it, but also it would have just taken up time.
3417.36 3420.96 speaker3  A roadblock for roadblock's sake is not a fun thing.
3420.08 3428.32 speaker2  Exactly.
3424.08 3441.28 speaker3  But like this was straight up just like, yeah, there's no reason to not get you back through this door.
3437.20 3491.28 speaker0  out to Andy, we were talking about the campaign that you're actually playing in right now. And he was asking me about ways to carry forward and I kind of told him, I was like, well, if you want them to do something that you don't expect, give them a dead end. And it's what I did with Thomas and Luke in the, in the box that was hanging over the, the pulping, the juice box as I've thought of it. Where the fighters, the loser got pulped and juiced onto the crowd below. I basically, I put you guys in there. I had no fucking clue. No, I know that you think that, uh, I'm, I'm paying really close attention and I am, but I forgot Luke had that gun.
3487.36 3509.28 speaker2  That's exactly what I was going to ask is like, did you remember that I had that? No, no, I didn't. isn't as stupid as you think he is.
3508.88 3514.88 speaker3  Yeah.
3512.40 3518.80 speaker2  And then we just go into the next character or something. Yeah.
3517.60 3522.24 speaker3  What do you have in strength? We could settle this.
3521.68 3535.12 speaker2  Yeah. You need, what's your score? Strength 55. Okay.
3533.76 3538.72 speaker3  26.
3537.84 3545.60 speaker0  40. Luke wins that one. Oh shit.
3543.84 3566.32 speaker3  Good thing that didn't happen canonically. Um, we literally had someone on the subreddit ask. They're like, Oh man, I wanted to see John kill Keith. Yeah. And we all agreed. Yeah.
3563.44 3597.60 speaker2  Keith kills John and you know what? I'm going to role play it out. Keith, uh, walks into the, uh, walks into the cube, squares up with John and we're looking at each other in the eye. And Keith is looking at John like, man, I really don't want to do this. John is looking at Keith like, man, I really want to do this. Really wants to kill me. And I see that. And then you shoot him.
3596.72 3613.84 speaker3  You just pulled the gun. Yeah. And then you pull the gun out of your penis.
3612.08 3623.60 speaker0  if you don't hit the Patreon goal? I know.
3621.92 3639.76 speaker2  We will have the door open.
3639.04 3654.16 speaker3  That's not true. That's not true. Oh my God. I know. Shout out to Taylor.
3651.44 3663.12 speaker0  sweater vest with Joe on his backstory. We are also bringing her back shortly. Oh, spoilers. I haven't listened to yours.
3659.20 3686.16 speaker2  Also, uh, on, on one of the breaks, also shout out to product. and recycle to recycle a beer can.
3684.96 3703.52 speaker3  I was trying to pull us up. No question from Joe. Yes, we are going to end the podcast.
3702.48 3718.40 speaker0  Uh, sadly. We will have to, uh, stop releasing, uh, weekly and free episodes and any episodes for anyone we'll just shut down completely.
3714.56 3720.16 speaker3  And let's not mention that we like, don't even mention we'll keep playing it. Just be like, no, this is the end.
3719.60 3728.48 speaker0  Yeah, of course. It's the end. You definitely won't keep playing. And we'll, we'll know.
3724.80 3734.96 speaker3  I mean, we won't know what happens to these characters, but, uh, if you don't,
3734.48 3737.04 speaker2  Oh yeah.
3734.96 3746.40 speaker0  No, I'll never hang out with these guys again. Why would I?
3745.12 3757.12 speaker3  That's the bottom line. He, he, he put, he puts hours and hours and hours and hours into it. It needs to be, uh, uh, something that he can be able to do.
3752.64 3776.48 speaker0  But more importantly, we really want to grow this into a big enterprise where we are delivering you solid content, not only on a weekly basis, but maybe a twice a week basis, the episodes can get longer. We can get bonus episodes. We can start a second podcast. There are so many things that we can do.
3773.76 3781.76 speaker3  It's something we'd really like to keep doing all of us.
3779.04 3790.96 speaker0  Thank you so much for hopping on board right away. That's so fucking cool.
3787.44 3799.84 speaker3  That's one of the easiest ways you can help, uh, help us grow is by telling your friends that, uh, we're doing this weird thing. If you know somebody who likes funny stuff, tell them. If you know somebody who likes spooky stuff, tell them.
3797.68 3803.12 speaker0  If it's the same person, you can tell them twice.
3801.36 3822.56 speaker3  We'd love to hear it. Even the negative reviews, like really help us. you know, this podcast is just for white guys sitting around being funny. And they didn't say trying to be funny.
3820.08 3830.88 speaker2  Thank God they didn't say trying.
3826.32 3837.28 speaker3  So a horror podcast, you know, role play podcast isn't for everybody, but at least you like us.
3834.64 3896.72 speaker0  Thank you so much for supporting us. It really honestly, it, it means, it means so, so much to us that you care enough to do that. And we are infinitely and, uh, disgustingly grateful. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Uh, so let's send it on back to Wolf the dog. We'll see you next month.
