0.00 167.04 speaker0  Hello, my friends. It's your pizza delivery driver, Wolf the Dog. And I'm here to deliver you a box of hot, fresh, contention news pizza in 30 minutes or less, or you get your money back. And y'all know we are delivering that steamy, gooey, cheesy news straight from 694.2 PTBP. Wolf the Dog's favorite kind of pizza is mayonnaise pizza with anchovies on it. I like my pizza to have some extra stink on it, my babies. Now, before y'all burn the roof of your mouth on that hot delivery, we got an announcement. This week, Wolf is here to tell y'all that we are going to have a special presentation in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP, contention's newest and only radio station. We are going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending to be People. If you have questions for any of the fine people on that show, send them to at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram, or post them on our Facebook page or the subreddit, or email them to pretendingpod at gmail.com, or go all out. Record audio of you asking your questions and send them that so they can use it in the episode, my babies. Speaking of questions, I want answers. It's time for the news. Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother. He then murdered that woman and stole the watch that was passed down from William Beanes off of Fergie's corpse. Currently, Keith is in bed at Hotel Motel. Call him Ferguson, call him the Duke. Either way, he's a real motherfucker. Currently, Officer John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews are being held hostage by the Fonzie lady who works for Marvin Glass after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins. I'm grieving all week with you, John P. Officer Clark Bishop was inducted into the Circle of Knowledge. There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past. Currently, Clark is in a cab headed back to contention from the mill on the other side of the city. There's always something happening in contention, and 100% of the time, it is Kudzu with no backbone.
165.68 212.12 speaker1  and I thought I had killed him, and in fact, I think he might have been a ghost because I don't know how I didn't hit him. Wait, what? I was driving down town. Joe killed again, but he just kept going. That's exactly. I was driving downtown right in front of Jimmy John's. This guy was walking on the sidewalk, and I don't know if he was fucking with me or if he really was trying to commit suicide, but he did this big, exaggerated and I didn't adjust. I mean, it was as if he wanted to slap my headlight. He was that close when he jumped, and I didn't feel a bump or anything, and I looked in my rear-view mirror, and he was just walking and looked at me and just kept walking with headphones on. I don't know what he was doing. I think he was fucking with me, but how I didn't hit him is still a mystery to me. It was insane.
210.62 216.48 speaker2  That's a dumb way to fuck with people.
215.36 218.14 speaker1  My life in DJ.
216.48 224.16 speaker2  I know a hilarious prank.
221.10 250.96 speaker3  I picked the second row in the very middle where no one else was sitting, and then I sit down, and the waiter comes up, and I look over, and the woman that had come in behind me with three very rowdy children comes and looks, and she goes, oh, I didn't realize you were sitting here, and sits right next to me with her three kids, and I was like, are you fucking kidding me?
249.32 258.54 speaker1  but that happened to me at LMO where it was an empty theater, and I'd got my tickets early,
257.02 261.90 speaker3  I was like, why would you have picked that, or why did they give you that seat?
259.90 265.70 speaker1  I don't understand how this happened. And she said something, she's like,
264.84 297.92 speaker3  and I was like, you know what? I came to a children's movie. I was kind of expecting kids to be here. I was like, just didn't expect somebody to sit right next to me, and she goes, you look really familiar, and it turns out I had served her at Jilardi's once, and she added me on Facebook a long time ago, but she can't be 30 years old, but like, yeah. So she was talking to me, but she was fucking talking to me the whole time, the whole movie. Oh, you want the movie? She did share her pizza and her popcorn with me though. That's cool as fuck.
297.08 302.38 speaker2  However.
299.86 314.26 speaker3  No joke, she goes, you kind of look like the dad now,
313.10 317.80 speaker2  Yep.
316.56 334.02 speaker3  I'm the dad now. She was like, I'll hit you up on Facebook next time I want to go see a movie. Hold on just a second.
332.68 337.54 speaker2  that the woman sitting next to you
336.30 360.86 speaker3  But it's just escorted her out, Just looks at it and then looks up at her and is like, ma'am, someone in the theater. When we do the dream sequence thing, is that going to be solo, red solo cup?
358.14 379.42 speaker2  going to start, or at least what I told you and what you had to do? Gearing up to this session.
377.58 381.50 speaker3  so you might have to do it in real life.
379.42 390.50 speaker2  Can you tell us the dreams you gave us? With your minds. Luke's joke was that you were putting dreams in our head. Which I do.
388.78 392.58 speaker3  Which is like, you do that.
390.50 425.86 speaker2  Yeah, you do pop up in my dreams a lot. That makes sense. Theoretically. Oh. That makes sense. I'm coming. You know, it's good to practice. Same voice. I killed my brother. Yeah, basically.
422.70 446.70 speaker3  I orchestrated a plan to have my brother killed. Not that Keith cares, but yeah. Jesus. What was her name, Joan? Joan. Joan and Fergie are both. Joan Robin.
444.74 486.70 speaker2  was you made it back to Hotel Motel and you put the watch that Ferguson had been wearing Yes. The motel's safe. And your room, and then you went to sleep. Keith Wigner, you are standing at a bar. It is empty, except for yourself and the bartender. The place smells like piss and vomit. It looks like people left in a hurry. The man behind the bar, he's like wearing clothes that they look like they're from the Gilded Age, you know, late 1800s. He looks at you with a fearful smile.
483.90 501.78 speaker3  What can I get you, sir? Answers? Cocaine? The prior, what's that, what do you say? I got enough of that.
498.66 538.90 speaker2  As soon as you stumble over all of those words, the saloon-style doors of this wooden floor joint fling open as a woman that you recognize struts toward your side, carrying with her a massive trunk. She heaves it onto the bar and opens it up, revealing a few familiar items. The camera, the gun, and the radio are sitting there in the trunk. The camera's light is red, as is the light on the gun, but the light on the radio is green, and you hear yourself say,
536.82 549.62 speaker3  and you know these other two take a few days. What if they came for me? What if they come for me?
546.14 874.02 speaker2  pulls a corkscrew out of his pocket and holds it out, and holds it on the bar in front of you, pointy-side up. Abruptly, he slams his fucking head into the corkscrew and stares at you as he begins twisting the corkscrew, little bits of cocaine falling out of the hole in his head. You look down, and the coke has fallen into perfect lines, forming a little stick figure family of uppers. You pull out a $100 bill that has Abraham Lincoln on it, and you roll it up real tight. As you inhale the powder bumper sticker family, Lloyd steps backward, phasing through the wall of the bar, and disappearing from sight completely. You are pulling into the police department parking lot in your police cruiser, and you have that weird feeling, like you were on autopilot the whole drive. You were just remembering your dream from last night. That's not the only thing on your mind, though. You see yourself grabbing the revolver with your handkerchief, putting it in her hands, and pulling the trigger. You see the flash. You see her blood spill out onto the duvet cover. You're parked in the contention police department parking lot. The ground is hard, wet, and cold. You are rolling across it with relative ease, avoiding the sight of the older man in the fancy suit mopping the floor and singing mouth trumpet, along with Louis Armstrong. The door that reads open from your side swings in, and the bell atop the door rings, queuing the owner of this establishment their black cloak shielding their identity, just as they drop a massive book on the ground and stumble back out into the night. You look around, and you are sitting on the floor in the back of clinkers. The sound of some children's television program being blared over pool balls and drunken conversation is immediately nostalgic. A young Gary Daley, an oversized sweater and tall white socks, walks in and pulls a large leather book out of his bag. He looks over his shoulder as he opens the book, and he winces as he rips a page from the big old tome. He pauses, listens, quickly puts the book back in his bag as he moves directly toward you with his torn sheet in hand. reading from this paper. The script seems to catch little sparks as he mutters each phrase like a karaoke situation, He continues to chant as he presses the blade of the knife against his thumb, the elasticity of his skin gaining more and more tension until finally breaking under enough pressure and releasing the blood necessary to complete this spell. Gary Daley clenches his fist and holds it above your head, letting a few drops fall onto your bald baby head. The sparks ignite what remains of the paper and the flames begin to float and dance in the air. These tiny bits of flame do a little synchronized jig around your head, bathing your body in warm light. The flames disappear and Gary quickly grabs a rag and washes the blood off of your baby head Well, two down, one to go. of the contention police department in Drew's cherry red Mini Cooper with black stripes. A woman who fashions herself to look like Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli from the 1970s television program Happy Days is sitting in the back seat holding both of your guns. that happened to Clark Bishop? Kinda. I think you kinda blacked out in an odd place and came to for a second in a taxi. Oh, you mean at the end, yeah, yeah.
873.06 882.66 speaker1  Can't mean anything.
878.78 990.46 speaker2  You do not stop, you do not slow, you run. It is imperative that you get there, that you stop them. you can make it, you jump off the bridge. There's no way you're going to hit the water, you brace for impact. You've seen a lot of fucked up shit but you can't remember a time when your shin bone was shooting through your kneecap. Fuck, your pain tolerance is incredible. You keep running. It doesn't really look like running anymore but you fight through the awkwardness. The blood loss is massive. Then you see it, your old nemesis, your old buddy old pal. You remember why these animals are filling the creeks. You get the fuck in the creek too. Blood is trailing behind and the pain in your knee is searing. Your favorite black mass is following you along the shoreline and that's when you see it. You're just there in the window. Think fuck what happened stance. You keep hobbling down the creek trying to outpace your enemies before you're gone. At the closest point to your backyard, you muster everything in your reserves and leap out of the creek, waving your arms violently and shouting. You desperately attempt to get your attention. as it makes a sharp turn and hits a curb. Looking out the window, you see that you have just arrived at the contention police department.
988.58 1007.34 speaker1  I was trying to think what I would do in that situation. is the video, it's a really skinny room.
1006.10 1011.10 speaker3  to get kicked in the face.
1009.54 1017.82 speaker1  He's like, I'm not gonna be able to outrun it, and I'm not gonna be able to get across its path. Is it jumping and stuff?
1016.98 1028.02 speaker2  and it's freaking the fuck out. Oh, like a horse would in a restaurant? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, just kind of like that.
1026.38 1043.18 speaker1  as people just fucking scatter. It was kicking tables and chairs and shit. You could have had collateral damage either. It was kicking that shit so hard. It was like a cartoon flinging a chair back behind it. This was a terrified horse. On the news, it was like,
1042.10 1060.18 speaker3  they interviewed the owner, and it says, he likes to run away a lot. This isn't surprising. It's like, well, that's not good. Yeah, it's not. Your horse is in my bar.
1058.30 1068.86 speaker1  I always thought that might happen someday.
1065.98 1073.26 speaker2  because they're flying at approximately one horsepower. Whoa. That was good.
1072.42 1082.30 speaker3  No, not boo. No, it's just true. Nay.
1080.02 1099.58 speaker2  Hey is for horse and strength. No, not bound by the truth. Yes, no restraints.
1098.74 1103.18 speaker1  Who did it? Who did it?
1102.10 1106.86 speaker3  Here's the goo.
1105.94 1117.06 speaker2  who- Chief Maggie's life? Nice. Tell me who killed her.
1115.90 1121.06 speaker3  Art galore, dude.
1118.62 1137.02 speaker1  that you might give us a chance to ask a question. So for a while now I've been thinking about really good heart of the issue questions that you would have to elaborate on. And when you gave us the yes or no right at the end there, I was like, fuck.
1135.58 1195.18 speaker2  I think mine was pretty good. The town of contention is draped in a thin layer of fog on this sharp blustery not yet morning of December 5th. There is an old Husky, a dirty shade of white, The ancient dog's paw pauses mid-step when it hears the humming of car engines approaching, the only sound cutting through the dormant town aside from the howling of the wind. Through the arthritic pain pulsating through her joints, this old Husky bounds off the street and down an alley has three cars, a yellow taxi cab, a cherry red Mini Cooper with black stripes, and a contention police cruiser pull into the contention police department parking lot. what they see in the Mini Cooper?
1190.78 1199.62 speaker3  Yeah, they see me, shit, sorry, I'm not Thomas.
1198.78 1210.26 speaker1  Yeah, they see.
1208.26 1217.18 speaker3  which they would recognize as his, and they see the Fonzie lady in the backseat.
1215.22 1221.46 speaker1  Does Clark have his wallet on him? Do we all get there at the same time?
1220.34 1231.18 speaker2  Clark, you. Okay, so then they would also see John Lee Pettymore
1230.06 1232.58 speaker3  Get a load of this.
1231.18 1240.34 speaker1  Do I have everything on me? You are wearing your pajamas,
1238.54 1248.46 speaker2  or your gun on you. We're all in the parking lot. You're all in the parking lot.
1245.02 1249.30 speaker3  I assume I am, I've got all my police uniform and everything.
1248.46 1261.18 speaker2  Absolutely.
1259.06 1278.30 speaker3  First, I'm Officer John Lee Pettymore. Yeah, I know. What's your name? Thank you. So check it out. If you wanna get that gun. Yeah, I do. That's fine.
1275.18 1292.78 speaker2  Just so you know, if I go missing or anything, You will be taken, you will be tortured. Marvin Glass does not fuck around, and he wants this gun, he wants it real bad, and he's gonna get it.
1290.46 1306.14 speaker3  Rosemary, I really hope you understand And he can send all of his goons, but what we're dealing with is just a bit more stressful. That's why I want you to help me.
1304.96 1311.22 speaker2  So let's go get that gun. Okay.
1310.18 1316.46 speaker3  All right, thank you.
1313.30 1319.02 speaker2  and she hands the gun that you let Drew have back to him. I take it.
1317.30 1321.82 speaker3  Oh, okay.
1320.42 1334.98 speaker2  there's a car in the parking lot that none of you recognize. It is a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
1330.90 1383.86 speaker1  I'm a little short, I don't have my wallet on me, my man. Is there any chance I could get this right on the house, pay it back next time I see you? It's Oscar. I was sleepwalking. Yeah? I must've ended up here sleepwalking. Well, you're a great liar, Clark.
1381.34 1390.14 speaker3  Everybody, I want y'all to meet Rosemary. Hey. Rosemary, this is everyone. Hey, I remember. I immediately get freaked out.
1389.10 1395.16 speaker1  Keith, Keith, get your gun on her. No, no, no, no, guys, hold on, hold on.
1392.50 1401.46 speaker3  She doesn't have a, I got my guns, it's all good. How did you? It's okay, it's fine, we're working together,
1400.14 1410.66 speaker2  and then we're all gonna be friends, everything's gonna be fine. Well, what's gonna happen, Rosemary,
1409.22 1414.18 speaker3  Yeah, sure, whatever, fine. We might give Marvin the gun
1411.92 1415.84 speaker1  if he really decides he wants it at the end of things, but.
1415.02 1418.98 speaker2  Yeah, I think he wants it.
1417.30 1427.06 speaker3  You weren't really there. You see, she had just executed two of my cousins for no particular reason. They were running away.
1425.58 1433.34 speaker1  Keith, get your gun on her.
1431.62 1436.62 speaker3  but it's still holstered.
1433.34 1438.66 speaker2  Anyway, y'all remember, y'all remember the Glass boys? Oh, yeah.
1437.46 1458.86 speaker3  Jermaine and Albert, is it? Alfred. the other one wasn't, quit babbling about that gun. Yep. Well, so Rosemary here and Charles Donovan, they're in our little town, trying to find those boys, trying to find the gun that, Alfred, which one's around? Which one's gone, which one's around?
1455.82 1460.38 speaker2  Alfred's still around, but I mean, not really mentally.
1458.86 1486.62 speaker3  Yeah, he won't shut up about the gun, so Marvin Glass, that's Alfred's daddy. He really wants that gun. So we're gonna go talk to him? he has some considerable resources we might be able to call upon to help us fight this unholy terror that's descended upon our town. So I kinda made an executive decision, and I enlisted the mob to help us. I'm here, I'm the mob,
1484.26 1496.38 speaker2  and we're all gonna do great together, I think. The contention police department and the Glass crime family are going to be wonderful business partners from here on out.
1494.78 1505.20 speaker3  In temporary cahoots. And she puts her hand on Clark Bishop's shoulder. Yeah, Clark, you cool with that? Good, good. Keith, you cool with that?
1502.68 1511.60 speaker1  I elbow her and get away from the hand. I turn directly to John, why does Marvin want the gun?
1509.06 1529.66 speaker3  Well, okay, see, that's what's gonna happen, is Marvin wants the gun because he thinks he can turn his boy back around. We have just seen the gun disappear, people, but I think if we all put our heads together, we can maybe bring some people back, like Tilly Bee. Rosemary leans forward,
1528.66 1535.74 speaker2  I push her back out. Not Rosemary, this is.
1533.54 1538.42 speaker1  Oh, I thought we were putting our heads together.
1535.74 1541.54 speaker3  No, Rosemary, this isn't about you, really.
1539.42 1544.74 speaker2  So yeah, he wants that gun
1543.22 1569.70 speaker3  or bring his boy back. is to defeat this, you know, ancient evil that's descended upon us, and I think we might need more than just the three of us would help things out, like, and one very motivated mafia boss trying to get his son back. Yeah. Do you see, I mean, because.
1568.86 1572.26 speaker2  and they weren't much help,
1570.82 1596.02 speaker3  if you don't solve it in two days, so I called the mob. Right now. You guys don't, I was gonna go, me and Drew were gonna go, y'all can go though, it might be helpful too, but I don't know if we should leave, you know what, I mean, it's an hour away. Goo's not gonna eat the town in two hours, right?
1595.10 1602.26 speaker1  Well, I hope not.
1600.98 1613.46 speaker3  Y'all seen any more, have we, can I do a perception check or awareness check to see if I've noticed other dogs
1611.10 1629.06 speaker2  that it's been like this for a couple days now or there have been any animals, and this is absolutely the first animal you've seen not in water in a couple days. Okay, cool.
1625.66 1631.98 speaker3  Let's go catch it or talk to it or pet it. Always thinking with your stomach.
1631.14 1636.28 speaker1  Let's go pet it. It wasn't a black lab, was it?
1633.66 1641.36 speaker3  No, it was a husky, an old husky. Why, you having weird dreams or something about black labs?
1639.06 1645.96 speaker1  No, Kerry Page's dog's still missing.
1642.86 1652.60 speaker3  Yeah, I think we know the creek to find that dog in.
1651.76 1657.28 speaker1  That's a good idea. One of you boys wanna give me a ride home real quick?
1656.46 1663.80 speaker3  Do I? Yeah, absolutely. I'll go in and get changed. Yeah.
1662.96 1664.92 speaker2  Yeah.
1663.80 1665.76 speaker3  Oh, no, I'm gonna go get that gun.
1664.92 1668.66 speaker2  Ah, right.
1667.66 1691.60 speaker3  look for the dog. Everybody come in. Yeah, I'll come in. Follow us, Rosemary. Yeah, okay.
1690.76 1694.64 speaker1  Yeah. And I don't open the door, and I look back at you guys.
1693.26 1699.98 speaker3  You guys know whose car that is? That red? No, I've never seen that car before.
1697.84 1706.90 speaker1  I look through the glass of the police department. Do I see anybody through the glass?
1702.78 1726.48 speaker2  but you do see that the desk that Drew uses that is within sight of the doorway has papers stacked super high on the desk that weren't there the last time you were at the station. And Drew normally keeps his desk pretty clean.
1725.66 1728.90 speaker3  All right, be safe, buddy. I wanna go look inside that car.
1728.06 1755.32 speaker2  Okay. So first, Keith, you walk over You kick in the door?
1753.42 1760.82 speaker3  I'm about to, but I see him go over there,
1759.98 1801.38 speaker2  Oh, I've got two guns. Totally. You look inside of it and inside the car, you see there's a big container of creatine powder sitting in the floorboard of the shotgun seat. That's like protein powder, right? Protein powder, yes, sir. And you also see two empty cans of Red Bull, the big ones. You also see a pair of Oakleys sitting on the seat, the shotgun seat.
1800.22 1830.14 speaker3  Is this a two-door car? No.
1824.98 1856.30 speaker2  you see a young man who was just previously walking furiously back and forth. He's frozen solid, hands up in the air. He's wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt and a red stripe tie. And in one hand, he is holding a large can of Red Bull. Drop it, party boy. He drops the can of Red Bull and it hits the ground and begins to spill onto the carpet, the like very thin, shitty carpet
1854.66 1860.10 speaker1  of the contention police department.
1858.94 1872.10 speaker3  I come in behind John.
1868.46 1887.50 speaker2  the contention police officers that I am here to talk to. If you would come on down and reach into my jacket pocket here, I think we won't have an issue when you see, oh, it's a badge. It's not a gun, it's a badge. I do.
1886.50 1902.70 speaker1  I'm heading over there and I'm reaching for the thing in my pocket
1901.58 1910.82 speaker2  Yes, it's that one.
1907.78 1917.26 speaker1  and shoot into the bottom neck area. Okay.
1915.06 1945.26 speaker2  If you could roll a firearms check for me. All right, and he rolled an aught four, which means that you win. So yours is higher and passed. So describe what happened. I used his alertness to see if he would recognize that it was coming in order to even try to resist the attack. I typically just roll, but yes, ask that more often. And I can always explain what I'm doing.
1943.66 1950.86 speaker3  I don't think that was a listener thing. That was just for me. Yeah, absolutely. I don't think anybody's gonna give a shit, but.
1948.50 1972.68 speaker2  I don't think the people who listen to this will care.
1968.34 1986.64 speaker1  So I shoot and you guys see a little tranquilizer dart hit him. I hope it's really quick acting.
1982.08 1996.12 speaker2  As he like starts to wobble and wobble and then he looks at you and he's like, hey, what's up?
1995.28 2021.24 speaker1  What's the name on it? I'm gonna need you to sit down and I kind of help him sit in the nearby chair. I turn back to John. I'll explain, but get Keith in here. I do, you're Clark.
2018.76 2033.20 speaker3  Yeah, I will come in like, what are you doing? Wait, you got one of those for Rosemary? Do we need it? Yeah, hold on, what's going on here? How many you got?
2031.84 2066.66 speaker1  I'll explain to you guys. We can just shoot her. I had a, I hope you guys will respect my privacy. You're pretty. But I had some stuff happen last night and I just want you to trust me that I got it on good authority that the FBI was gonna be here this morning and that it was our job to make sure they didn't report back about all the crazy shit that was happening here in contention. You said good authority. and they said that these darts are special and whoever we tranq them with, they'll have to obey our orders for a while. Okay.
2064.16 2073.22 speaker3  Do you know how long a while is, mechanically speaking?
2071.44 2081.92 speaker1  I think our best bet though is to give them a bunch of instructions right the fuck now.
2080.48 2087.14 speaker3  It's a really cool gun you got there.
2085.14 2097.76 speaker1  he leaves and doesn't come back and whatever he tells his superiors is something that doesn't make them wanna come back.
2096.32 2128.32 speaker2  Do you think that we'd have time for shenanigans afterward? Oh, yeah, I snuck in here, I guess, after. Did you get upset when you saw Hey, Drew, those papers over there, He has pulled out tons of files out of your filing cabinets and is sorting through them.
2127.50 2141.88 speaker1  Yeah.
2138.40 2150.72 speaker2  in the history of the United States of America.
2147.04 2170.84 speaker3  but I understand that in today's law enforcement, it's often more of a PR game than anything, and frankly, we've been within' that pretty mightily. So you might not know what we're doin' to actually save the world.
2168.52 2185.48 speaker1  You ever conducted a press conference for yourself? Guys, what if we have him calm down? The popular is awesome.
2181.88 2201.00 speaker2  Everyone loves me all the time, mostly.
2196.00 2246.96 speaker3  well, it's super dark, but here's a possible, All right, we tell them that contention is a crossroads for human trafficking, and that all their children and people that then disappeared are in slavery. has a task force on the way. The meager resources of the contention PD were overwhelmed, despite the brave efforts of all the officers here, why don't you just call on in to Drew down here at the hotline and let him know? Maybe not the black goo. Maybe not the black goo. Maybe just the stuff flattering us.
2244.12 2254.04 speaker1  We could tell him to give the contention PD as wide a berth as possible, that they are still part of the task force and are the feet on the ground.
2252.80 2258.40 speaker3  Don't interfere with us. We should also say we're working closely
2257.56 2263.92 speaker1  I had a wiper. I was thinking we might have a conference at the church. Yeah.
2263.08 2270.72 speaker3  That's good. You're a genius.
2268.64 2274.56 speaker1  a little bit proud of that.
2270.72 2287.40 speaker3  So do we wanna have that untelevised event that he does and then send him on his way back and say, they got it under control, or actually have the FBI come out here and no, we don't want them to come.
2285.44 2297.10 speaker1  and then get the fuck out of town and don't ever come back. Don't ever come back. Tell his superiors that it must have been a false alarm that contention PD's got everything under control in that town.
2295.76 2297.94 speaker3  Bizarre internet hoax.
2297.10 2304.76 speaker1  There you go. Cause we're gonna need to. We should do it today.
2303.92 2309.60 speaker3  What time is it right now? Early.
2306.70 2312.12 speaker2  It's like five in the morning, 4.30 in the morning.
2310.76 2317.22 speaker3  We don't know how much longer these truth serum darts are gonna work. Let's hold it. Whatever you wanna call it.
2315.88 2318.88 speaker1  A 10 a.m. press conference. I'm hoping.
2318.06 2343.06 speaker3  No, no, no, no. What we gotta do is go down to that church right the fuck now, get up on the auditorium, film one of them on our smartphones and get him out of here. And then go back to business. I don't think it should be filmed though. We can pose in front all Mr. Science theater style, just silhouetted acting like reporters. Hank, question.
2340.84 2350.42 speaker1  Clark is already heading toward the evidence locker to find the camera that we always use for filming things.
2349.58 2370.54 speaker3  And then we'll send it into. When you go back there. What is the local news channel? that we all listen to and love. Local talk radio.
2369.70 2378.26 speaker1  Oh, let's do that.
2376.54 2382.14 speaker3  Well, everybody in town loves Wolf the dog. That's true.
2380.62 2386.22 speaker1  All right, let's get this done quick. Yep.
2385.38 2393.74 speaker3  What? Drew, top up something pretty for this dumb ass to say.
2392.90 2399.30 speaker2  I have to do it all. No, you have to do it all.
2397.58 2406.58 speaker3  because we've said what he's gonna say.
2403.18 2415.56 speaker1  let the contention PD do whatever the fuck they want. And that everything the contention PD has been doing
2411.62 2421.48 speaker3  has been a-okay, what we needed them to do. Don't worry, but be careful out there.
2420.22 2429.14 speaker1  So we have him say that. For immediate release.
2427.46 2435.04 speaker3  Yeah, for immediate release. Yeah. Haven't played a couple times over the course of the day.
2434.22 2436.86 speaker2  Well, cause that's the thing,
2435.04 2444.78 speaker3  this is gonna be a big news. They're gonna want this. They're not gonna want it. This is hot shit.
2441.12 2449.42 speaker2  Well, they've been waiting to hear something from you guys.
2448.46 2452.28 speaker1  Oh, hey, yeah.
2449.42 2459.70 speaker3  Should we have somebody else besides Drew email him? Remember when he didn't tell us about those 30 missing people?
2458.86 2465.18 speaker2  You can watch me. We can all email them together. Drew, the whole point of your job
2463.76 2480.68 speaker3  is that you're supposed to be able to do it while we're not watching you. And how about you get dressed? Yeah, buddy.
2479.84 2483.04 speaker1  Retroactively. As soon as agent is done recording.
2482.20 2485.48 speaker3  Can we start over? Can we start over?
2483.88 2498.40 speaker1  As soon as the agent is done recording and maybe those two are getting the emails sent off, I'm telling them about. And now I'm gonna need you to go back to your superiors and tell them kind of what you said on that news broadcast,
2497.56 2501.58 speaker3  Yeah.
2498.40 2507.96 speaker1  And that there's no reason to send anybody else down here for a while at least, but you probably never need them again. It's just an internet hoax.
2506.92 2510.84 speaker2  I did it right?
2509.84 2514.16 speaker1  I pat him on the back. You did. You did.
2513.34 2518.00 speaker3  And he was your boss. I'd give you a promotion. You look strong and energized.
2516.36 2520.28 speaker1  You look swole, buddy.
2519.20 2545.72 speaker2  Look at them wings. I appreciate it. Hey, wait, real quick. Before you fucking go,
2542.88 2573.44 speaker3  And he's gonna have to clean up this mess. No, I don't shoot him. I failed my firearm, shit.
2570.82 2592.48 speaker2  are no longer in the cells. Are all our artifacts still there? The cell doors are locked. No one's there.
2589.22 2596.78 speaker1  but cells are empty, God fucking damn it. I go back and get changed.
2593.90 2602.56 speaker3  But just the people are gone, not our stuff. The stuff is in a locker.
2600.58 2605.86 speaker1  Just look for yourself as I kind of motion with a hand over toward them.
2603.74 2612.82 speaker3  Okay, we go check it out.
2611.98 2618.26 speaker1  Put my clothes on. What the fuck?
2613.82 2634.62 speaker3  I check the doors to make sure that they're actually locked. They're locked and secured.
2633.34 2638.22 speaker2  Yeah, that flies.
2637.38 2651.26 speaker1  I turn to Drew. Hey, Drew, when was the last time you noticed them in there? Well, they were in there last night.
2648.98 2653.28 speaker3  with cameras, let's go check those.
2652.10 2663.20 speaker1  A fist bump, Keith.
2658.52 2713.96 speaker2  fast forwarding through, you see the cat in your police station running all over the place, constantly jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping from spot to spot to spot, hiding, running, running. And when you are watching the footage of the cells, you see both Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs silently just get really scared and move back up against the wall, and they start kind of moving away. And then all of a sudden, you see their bodies picked up off the ground and slammed into the ground and slammed into the ground. And then as if they were never there, they are gone. Do we need to? That's a really good point, because you have seen this
2712.36 2720.00 speaker3  happen a lot of times. We just know what it is, but I pass anyway.
2717.64 2727.48 speaker2  And especially because it was also on camera, I won't call for a sanity roll there.
2725.20 2731.20 speaker1  that the cat started freaking out and see if I can tell
2730.12 2759.80 speaker2  Interesting. it was looking up. You see the paneled ceiling of the police department. You know, the kind of ceiling that they have in classrooms that you can throw pencils into. Drop ceiling. Drop ceiling. Drop ceiling.
2756.60 2773.90 speaker3  fell from the sky onto my cop cruiser? Do you think? Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. I don't know. That happened up, you know what I mean? The sky opened. Cat was looking up. Happened in the junkyard body.
2772.64 2779.48 speaker2  We're not talking about the slamming.
2778.04 2784.92 speaker1  Yeah, the falling from the sky.
2782.56 2800.52 speaker3  into the ground and then disappeared. Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston. Got smashed into the ground and then disappeared. The first body fell and didn't disappear.
2799.40 2828.56 speaker1  Very succinctly put, Keith. Thank you. we think that the animals can see the goo?
2827.60 2841.36 speaker3  Well, I think we're gonna have to wait till the radio turns back on. We're gonna have to wait till the radio turns back on to test that theory out.
2840.52 2844.24 speaker1  We can't do that.
2841.36 2911.12 speaker3  Real quick, I don't know how any of this all works, but I was thinking about, I think at some point, one of us is probably gonna have to shoot ourselves with that gun to go to this other place where all this weird shit and those photographs are coming from. And then maybe the radio, or the helmet. One of them, I think there's a sequence maybe that takes you there and brings you back. But I'm not sure what swapping bodies has to do with it. Maybe one of us has to die. Why? Did you have some kind of weird dream about that? I don't know how I know it, though. Hey, Keith rolled to be a better liar. Keith rolled to lie to us right now. Is it weird shit?
2909.06 2916.38 speaker1  I put my hand on Keith's shoulder. Weird shit is all around us, man. If you just happen to know this, I fucking believe you, man.
2915.12 2928.40 speaker3  I just knew it. I don't know, I can't remember how or what. Did we not all know that? just knowing that?
2926.76 2951.52 speaker2  against other players. Oh, so Luke just gets the bullshit. with a different group and somebody had an incredibly high Persuade and they just forced Dean's player to keep doing stupid stuff by rolling Persuade against him. Yeah, that doesn't sound fun. I mean, it sounds fun.
2949.48 2970.68 speaker3  No, it's objectively the worst scenario. you can just play my character then. What are the recourses for discovering if a player is lying to you?
2969.30 2983.32 speaker1  Well, I was about to say, if you want to play it out. I've kind of just said that I believe him.
2981.04 2984.88 speaker2  Is there any reason why you're not telling us?
2983.32 3003.12 speaker3  Honestly, it just popped in my head. I thought maybe, did we not already know? You know, I might be wrong even, let's just see. Let me go check and see, is it red still? You guys walk into the evidence locker
3000.40 3008.32 speaker2  You see the camera, it's light is red. You see the gun, it's light is red. And you see the radio and it's light is green. Oh!
