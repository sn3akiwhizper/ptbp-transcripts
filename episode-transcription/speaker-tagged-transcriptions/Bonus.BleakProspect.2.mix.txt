0.00 73.40 speaker0  Hey, hey, hey, baby, baby. It's your big bad dad that is always so rad. Your mother that loves to smother. Your aunt that likes to use weird font. I'm all that and more, never an eyesore. It is I, Wolf the dog, and I am breaking through all that mental fog to do what you ask. To broadcast live from 694.2 PTBP, my various family members and or babies. Now, speaking of family, we got a letter from someone very dear to us. This edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Taylor B, who tagged that pretending pod over there on Twitter. They write, howdy wolf, the dog, not wolf's dog, wolf. Just wanted to drop a line and let you know I've been greatly enjoying the radio show you host every hour on the hour. Been listening to it nonstop since I discovered it several days ago. Or was it weeks ago? I don't know anymore.
69.72 78.24 speaker1  since I fixed it to 694.2 PTBP,
76.12 220.32 speaker0  even picks up anymore, I think. Anyway, I wanted to just send you a friendly reminder that Mark Zuckerberg is absolutely the worst. However, I also wanted to remind you he and his robot cronies are in charge of Instagram as well as Facebook. I mean, face foot. I mean, ah, nevermind. When you trust social media, you're allowing your identity and your time and your attention to be sold to the lowest bidder. That's why I use my Twitter to pimp out cool shit like pretending to be people. You continue to haunt my dreams, wolfy boy. Keep it up. You only listen every hour on the hour? What about between the hours? The only social media wolf likes was Craigslist Miss Connections. Lot of folks think they see me skulking around in the dead of night rummaging through a dumpster of three. Lot of folks might be right. Remember, if you wanna write up something for your wolf to have, tag us on the internet. Fuck every billionaire. This here is part two of Scott Dorward's wretched call a Cthulhu scenario bleak prospect, Scott Dorward. Don't step back because we're pushing forward. Clench your rucksack, because we're all cornered by Grady Philip drug with real life. Life, surreal, in retrospect a dream. Easy times, feel less than serene. In the moment it's hard to count your blessings. So we long for days gone past us. Grief and strife,
218.88 225.88 speaker2  I'm a Star Trek.
222.32 244.16 speaker3  when you see like bald cats that have those big folds, something I did not realize is that cats that have darker stripes on their heads, which is a lot of cats, they just follow the pass of that fold. Oh, wow. So all cats look fucking weird underneath their hair.
242.68 288.32 speaker2  Okay, well, I've got a tabby Oh, dear. Yes, so yeah, what actually happens with Dr. Coombs is mechanically you gain seven points of pow and six points of luck.
286.20 299.88 speaker3  before I step on one of these things.
296.36 328.76 speaker2  that this thing is moving around inside your foot. you can, you know, you just know it's there. Well, it's up to you. Is that okay with me? When obviously you have a parasite that has borrowed its way into your flesh. So, I mean, that may not make you especially happy, but on the flip side, you're feeling good.
324.96 350.08 speaker3  so you might get to be more weary of it than most. I can feel it.
347.92 372.68 speaker2  I can feel it moving around in there. It's a- It doesn't feel bad. It doesn't-
370.88 377.12 speaker3  You're positively fucking radiant.
375.68 404.68 speaker2  higher than it's been in a long time. Maybe like Crix's neck. It's a- It doesn't- It feels good. Yeah, this is better than I felt in years. This is, but I gotta get it out right though. That I got, I mean, it's a parasite, right? It's like-
403.72 423.40 speaker3  Yes, yeah. Oh, hold on. Let me see if I can wriggle around in there, like that thing could. I grab the doctor's foot and see if I can stick my fingers inside.
421.92 441.40 speaker2  You certainly can. Yeah, once you find the right spot in there, your fingers just sink into the warm,
440.00 449.88 speaker3  My fingers are in your foot.
446.08 470.00 speaker2  It's just a thing, you barely feel it. On the other hand, I think Thomas Dolan needs to make a sand roll because your finger is now deep within his foot.
466.12 488.92 speaker3  you know, life's been pretty kooky the last few years. Why would I let this, you know, of all things get me down? So Freddie, pass me those tongs. All right, doc, I'm gonna try to fish this thing out of you, all right?
486.00 496.04 speaker2  If you can't find it, that's fine too.
492.88 502.36 speaker3  does my hand just keep slipping up in there without resistance, like? Yeah. What is the physical limitation of what I can get in there?
500.68 535.40 speaker2  Sooner or later, I'm, yeah, sooner or later you hit the barrier of the edge of his foot and your finger doesn't come out the other side. So, you know, you get most of your finger into his foot. And it is quite spiky and there's a sharp moment of pain as you can feel his little teeth biting into your flesh.
531.64 539.00 speaker3  and I'm gonna gingerly holding onto, like, two spikes,
538.16 551.20 speaker2  Okay. Well, it's even easier than that because its teeth have sunk into you. So as you pull your finger out, it's just there clasped onto the edge
549.96 555.44 speaker3  I don't care if you crush my finger, you step on this motherfucker.
554.60 556.36 speaker2  That's what we tried.
555.44 582.52 speaker3  It's the same thing. We need another plan. Who's got a lighter? That's smarter. I smoke, I've got a lighter.
580.44 586.72 speaker2  with a little bit of fuel in it.
584.60 593.56 speaker3  and I put the flame to the bottom of it and I see what happens.
590.44 602.16 speaker2  and almost immediately drops off onto the ground, screaming in pain. There's a kind of purplish ooze coming out of it
599.72 613.84 speaker3  as it's writhing on the ground in agony. I'm gonna bring the lighter to the ground and try to torch the rest of the thing, keep the flame to it and try to dispose of it.
611.36 621.60 speaker1  you could dump on to make the flame bigger but not too big to burn down your shack here? Bit of rubbing alcohol.
620.76 627.84 speaker3  and see if we can.
626.12 634.48 speaker2  No, it looks like it's working.
633.08 643.64 speaker1  Maybe it was made by Bic,
639.88 649.32 speaker2  Yeah, and certainly after a few seconds or 30 seconds or whatever of burning this thing,
646.52 654.76 speaker3  it is very much dead. What does my finger look like where it bit me?
651.72 662.56 speaker2  Like it's had a small chunk of flesh bitten out of it. Just blood and pain.
659.88 664.92 speaker3  Ghostly voice emanating from it.
663.40 678.72 speaker2  Blood and pain, blood and pain.
676.68 691.88 speaker3  and throw them on these fucking eggs before they hatch into critters that can pass through the walls of off-feet and mason jaws.
690.28 696.92 speaker2  We can't leave these here if they hatch.
694.12 705.44 speaker3  Doc, I got a feeling there might be a few more people in this camp with these eggs in them you could study. So why don't we just burn these ones we got right now?
702.68 719.16 speaker2  Yeah, I think that's what we gotta do. I can't take the risk of this getting out of here. Yeah, I mean, it's fairly simple. You can just put a bit of surgical spirit in there and light that and destroy the eggs and the one that's hatched really easily.
717.88 722.88 speaker3  Perfect, that's what we'll do.
719.46 740.44 speaker2  Then you dispose of your specimens quickly, simply, and without catastrophe.
738.76 749.80 speaker1  I just kept my mouth shut the whole time. I was like, just don't say anything and they'll fix it. It'll be okay.
747.84 761.20 speaker2  We gotta keep our eye on the prize at this point. We gotta get Billy and Esther back. I think we should head over to Hiram's old place.
758.60 765.04 speaker3  Greenleys, let's set out boys.
763.20 783.54 speaker1  and putting the eggs inside of us and then they hatch and then they go into other people and that's how it's spreading? You said something about a sacrifice earlier, but I was thinking that maybe they just take us to put the eggs inside of us.
781.38 790.94 speaker2  Did she say taken, they were taken people? Did she say that?
789.56 808.34 speaker1  Oh, that's right. Maybe they were in masks that don't have any designs on them. How likely is it that the spooky things are?
806.78 819.14 speaker3  I'm sure they are connected, but let's just, you know, let's go to Greenleys. We'll find out, we'll see what's going on.
815.82 822.56 speaker2  that maybe there's more of these things there. Is that what you're saying, Frederick? Should we take something?
821.74 829.50 speaker1  Oh yeah, I think they're growing them. I think they're breeding them.
828.18 838.60 speaker3  Well, definitely, yeah. I mean, we should, what do we got? What do we got? Probably we don't have access to a flamethrower. I don't know if that's been invented yet.
837.28 873.88 speaker2  In the medical shack, I mean, you do have a little bit of surgical spirits that you use for disinfecting wounds. I'm not a whole hell of a lot, but you got some. And you've also got maybe a pint of paraffin left that you use for the heater. So mixing maybe the spirits and the paraffin if need be and create like a little line of them that I can hand out to the guys. And then if we have lighters, each of us or something like that, it's just, these are just like-
872.24 882.88 speaker3  assuming it's a cyanide capsule.
877.88 892.24 speaker2  I'm picturing them as like just little to-go fuel canisters. Like you can pour them on something if you need to
891.40 900.36 speaker3  Whatever. But surprisingly tasty.
898.84 912.64 speaker2  Dolan, drop it, drop it.
910.88 919.96 speaker3  Mr. Mellon, did you grab that shotgun? Did that happen? This one? Oh yeah, I need to uncock it.
919.12 922.36 speaker1  Depends on.
921.04 930.24 speaker3  The kind of shotgun, I think. It's this kind.
928.56 937.40 speaker2  So yeah, it's not a pump action one.
933.56 951.24 speaker3  Okay, it's kind of spooky, but let's go to Greenleys. The back door was the idea, right? Or the back window. That's what Hiram said.
950.40 957.48 speaker2  from where you are.
954.60 963.48 speaker3  I don't know why we gotta make it super hot on ourselves.
958.48 1075.48 speaker2  Yeah, I mean, by this stage, it's probably early afternoon. So you make your way up the road towards Greenleys. And yeah, I mean, there are grounds to the house. So you can make your way off the road earlier than the driveway that goes up there by perhaps forcing your way through a hedge. And yeah, I mean, this is a fairly nice house. It's got what you reckon are probably several acres of ground, fairly well-tended. The lawn's nicely manicured. There's a few flower beds, which obviously aren't in bloom at this time of year, but are still in good condition. in fair old size, probably no more than about 50 years old. The thing that probably gets your attention more than anything else is there are a number of cars parked outside there. It looks like Mr. Brink collects cars. Can we see maybe people in the windows or if there's anybody working the grounds or anything like that? Sure, give me a spot hidden, Roll. doesn't notice any gardeners or anything. There don't seem to be any staff on site. You can't really see any activity going onto the windows. The place looks fairly quiet. It looks good. Do you wanna just move?
1074.36 1099.30 speaker3  They should call him Mr. Cause. All his key, he's got a lot of, let's go to the back.
1097.72 1105.52 speaker2  parked out the front.
1102.58 1128.76 speaker1  through the back, okay, because if anyone hears us once we get within earshot, they're not gonna take too kindly. I'm afraid, you know, the face of a thief is not one that people forget. when Hiram was here, then, hmm.
1126.72 1132.68 speaker3  he doesn't know you robbed this place, right?
1130.84 1148.12 speaker1  so who were those people there that night? I don't know, okay, moving on. not trying to make it harder for ourselves, that'd be silly. Let's sneak into the back now.
1147.20 1156.48 speaker3  All right, yeah.
1152.84 1173.48 speaker2  to the back of the house, and sure enough, there is a little, a small little wing coming off the back of the house that looks like it is probably the servants' quarters, whereas the rest of the house is on two stories, this is a one-story structure just out the back.
1171.80 1178.64 speaker1  and kinda get a feel of what's going on, or are we going straight down to the cellar?
1175.80 1183.48 speaker3  Play it by ear, and a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B, we gotta get through that door first, though.
1181.76 1216.00 speaker2  Yeah, our goal is to get through that, it's the window that had the broken lock, right? I think our goal should be the cellar, but yeah, keeping an eye out on the lay of the house, we're gonna have two kids, we're dragging out with this, hopefully. Is your plan something else?
1212.00 1225.60 speaker1  to try to look around through the window very stealthily to get a lay to see if, obviously, if there's someone right on the other side of the window, I don't wanna try to break in.
1224.06 1235.88 speaker2  if there was someone on the other side of the window, there aren't any curtains up, and looking in, there definitely isn't.
1233.44 1255.74 speaker1  my doidy hand around my ear, and press it up against the glass, and try to see if I can hear anything going on inside the house. Okay, give me a listen roll. 28 on a 50.
1252.12 1261.96 speaker2  you can't hear any activity at all.
1258.76 1268.12 speaker1  So he's gonna go ahead and try to open up the window.
1265.92 1313.56 speaker2  because it's easy enough to force. It's just a question of whether you can do so quietly. 43 on a 60. I mean, sure enough, as per Hiram's words, the lock on this is crap, and so just with a bit of force, yeah, it cracks, and you manage to avoid the noise of that being too loud, and the window squeaking as you slide it up. You have the window open, and you can clamber inside should you wish. Frederick's kind of our guy who is breaky any, and I trust that he has done his due diligence, that this is an okay thing. The coast is clear, so I just follow in his footsteps.
1310.24 1330.88 speaker3  calamitous happen to them, I follow as well. But I do pause for a moment to make sure nothing calamitous happens to them. That's good enough for me to go on through.
1327.80 1359.64 speaker2  through this window, and the room inside is just a fairly simple bedroom. There's an unmade bed. Sorry, when I say unmade bed, there are no sheets or anything on there. The whole place just looks unlived in. how long it's been since his partner bought this place?
1357.68 1363.44 speaker3  all the recent troubles.
1361.84 1372.28 speaker1  Maybe he doesn't have enough people
1369.40 1374.72 speaker3  I say we press on into the house very quietly. Agreed.
1373.12 1411.72 speaker2  Yeah, the door from this room opens out into a small corridor. Down to the left, there's obviously a back door that comes in this way. Heading towards the right, it seems to go towards the main house. And you can see that, yeah, there is a door that opens up into, certainly it looks like it opens up into the main building. There's also, off to your left, a flight of stairs that seems to go down.
1409.36 1414.68 speaker1  then we don't have to go into the big house.
1413.36 1422.96 speaker2  I think we should go down. We get, that's the direction, right?
1421.44 1429.36 speaker3  existing in the rest of the house, but we would figure out more of the fun mystery, so. But let's go down.
1428.24 1522.00 speaker2  You go down the stairs, and as you reach the bottom, it opens up, unsurprisingly, into some fairly large cellars. It looks like it's broken up into a number of different rooms. initially one fairly large room that's got shelves lining the walls, most of which are empty. There's obviously some old supplies, or, you know, some old cleaning supplies and a few jars sitting on the shelves that look like they've probably been there for a long time. There's spiders' webs. or worthy of note in this room that has a metal cylinder or case, or, you know, some kind of canister, metal canister sitting there. And next to it, there's a pair of heavy leather gloves and a set of forceps. that needs leather gloves and forceps to be touched. I don't know if I want to mess with that. That usually means something's dangerous.
1520.36 1547.84 speaker3  something like what we've seen, and that canister can hold it? I think we need the canister and those gloves, yeah. Yeah, I think 100% we should take it with us. the safe way to deal with these parasites, so.
1545.76 1572.52 speaker2  Yeah, I mean, the canister is, I mean, it's about a foot in diameter. Not that heavy, but as you pick it up, you can feel liquid sloshing around inside. Can I feel anything hitting the sides? Yeah, you can. Yeah, there's definitely something suspended in liquid in here.
1570.00 1592.32 speaker3  But we can't see the liquid or anything in there, right? It's a metal canister, no. maybe this is a thing for holding those fucking things.
1588.84 1610.64 speaker1  We put our money on the fact that it's holding these things and that this is where they start. And we use it as a bargaining chip as we head into the main house. If we need to dump it out on the floor or throw it on Casper, voice comes to voice.
1609.64 1613.52 speaker2  just to see what's in it?
1612.00 1627.72 speaker3  No, no, I don't. I don't think, no, no.
1623.88 1642.72 speaker1  and puts his hand on his shoulder and says, I could tell that you felt real good when it was inside you, but we're gonna need you to stay.
1641.76 1648.44 speaker3  Thank you.
1644.84 1653.72 speaker2  I just, if there was a place that we were going to open it, it might be better here and not back at the town. We're not gonna open it. Where everybody is, but.
1652.40 1661.96 speaker3  Yeah, we're not gonna open it here. We're not gonna open it in the wolverville. Fucking nowhere.
1658.80 1676.96 speaker1  Like they come in and they say like, we're gonna kill you. We say, no, you're not. We'll pour this on you or on the ground. They probably don't want that either.
1675.76 1682.48 speaker2  And it turns out there's a sandwich
1678.72 1690.12 speaker3  Then it will turned out we will have been caught in a bluff. But right now it seems like this is a good chip. We got to roll with it and not let these parasites.
1689.28 1694.24 speaker2  I'm with you.
1692.20 1718.80 speaker3  Doc, for all we know, these things are in you and me. Well, actually, since we feel like shit and my business partner started doing great, maybe it's in him. I don't know. Maybe it feeds off two hosts simultaneously. We got to figure it out though. And, and, and we got to save those kids, QAnon.
1717.96 1740.76 speaker2  Oh my God. God.
1739.92 1754.04 speaker1  You can, you can have the gloves.
1750.68 1771.00 speaker2  and I mean, there's not really a lot else of interest down here. There is a bit of a wine cellar. There's some fairly nice looking bottles of wine. Should you know anything about wine?
1768.36 1803.60 speaker3  and he grabs a few nice bottles of wine in case we have success. Excellent. What is that, a red? I spent some time rubbing shoulders with, you know, the Boston Brahmin and I can, I can tell you which, a few of these bottles, you know, they're not, they're not so bad. Mm, tannins. That's right. That's right, Freddy, tannins. Oh, it's got a floral bouquet. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
1800.80 1813.68 speaker2  and apart from your bottles of wine and the canister of whatever the fuck it is you found, you don't really find anything else of interest.
1812.72 1818.60 speaker3  anybody down here.
1817.36 1834.08 speaker2  or anything down here. down here.
1831.84 1843.72 speaker1  just to make sure there's no like hidden doorways
1840.76 1864.92 speaker2  You wanted to try to find any secret doors, so give me a spot hidden roll. that there are no secret doors down here. There's no secret areas. It is just a cellar. Voic.
1863.92 1872.36 speaker3  Did you see any doors? Can we move on up?
1869.08 1883.60 speaker1  and there doesn't seem to be any stinking secret doors down here, so I gotta keep my voice down. Let's get back through into the main house and then we'll get going. All right, all right.
1882.56 1894.16 speaker3  No offense, Mr. Mellon. It's just that you were a snagglepuss there for a second.
1892.56 1899.96 speaker1  My name's Frederick Mellon the First and I don't understand the reference.
1899.04 1914.28 speaker3  It's 1932. Let's go upstairs.
1910.84 1923.60 speaker2  and like I say, there is a door that looks like it goes into the main house.
1922.12 1935.44 speaker1  Okay, give me a listen roll. There's no one there.
1934.60 1940.20 speaker3  Let's go on in. Still be careful though.
1939.36 1950.72 speaker1  Why? There's no one there. We don't have to worry now.
1949.84 1956.20 speaker3  and I peep on through.
1951.92 1981.84 speaker2  and it opens up into what looks like a fairly large kitchen. There's a dining area there, a range cooker you can hear coming from upstairs what sounds like someone snoring fairly loudly.
1979.32 2000.60 speaker3  I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it sounds like we might be dealing with a fairytale troll or giant. That's just my first read. Let's move on further into the house and see what we see.
1997.44 2014.58 speaker1  Melon puts his finger up to his mouth and like a shh motion points at like a butcher's knife in this kitchen.
2011.60 2027.96 speaker3  Yeah, that's been on my back this whole time. Obviously since I haven't been playing it and referencing it, it's not because I forgot.
2026.96 2047.12 speaker2  all the way along.
2044.08 2055.12 speaker3  that big chef's knife and arm myself. Good looking out, Freddie.
2050.20 2100.08 speaker2  Are you moving en masse to the source of the snoring? Are you doing something else? I want to see if I can see any signs of like dirty floors or more drag marks or anything that would remind me of those bodies being dragged through the dirt like that. what rooms we can cover down here. And if we don't find the kids,
2098.48 2122.32 speaker1  but I say we go with your plan. I mean, I could put it against his throat too, but it's not very sharp.
2121.30 2167.88 speaker3  when you wake up, right? getting gravelly again, if you want to kill someone in the sleep, a knife is a knife. and fucking scare them, then let's go with a shotgun in their face, right?
2164.68 2195.72 speaker2  that would actually cut out a lot of downtime of a search, and if we just wanted to cut straight to the quick and ask the people upstairs, the person who's snoring upstairs, You're sneaking up the stairs. Are all three of you going?
2194.88 2206.48 speaker3  All three.
2204.32 2288.16 speaker2  it's going to be pretty difficult to be stealthy, but on the other hand, you're aided in this by the fact that the person you're sneaking up on which luckily are carpeted, across the landing, and the door to the master bedroom is open. The whole place is fairly expensively furnished. There's all sorts of object art and expensive bits of furniture and so on, but at the same time, the whole place seems to be the best possible evidence that money cannot buy taste because everything just clashes with each other to the master bedroom, and there is this really ostentatious four-poster bed there, and there is a man lying there in maroon silk pajamas, just lying sprawled across the bed, snoring away at the top of his voice. He's a middle-aged man, he's got graying temples, he's fairly slim, fairly pale as well, and yeah, he's out for the count.
2286.16 2297.28 speaker1  Raises the shotgun.
2293.80 2314.68 speaker2  he's sort of starfished out on the bed. Gross.
2312.72 2315.96 speaker4  Hey, hey.
2314.68 2320.84 speaker2  And yeah, he's sort of... His eyes half open.
2319.72 2327.88 speaker3  Hey, sleepyhead.
2323.68 2332.12 speaker2  standing there holding weapons, and he just-
2330.88 2335.40 speaker3  He just tenses up.
2333.56 2409.36 speaker2  Look, fellas, I don't know what you want. Look, take anything you want, okay? Yeah, you want money? Sure, sure, I got money. Are you Hiram's old partner? He looks really confused at this, and he says, Well, what's this got to do with Hiram? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can see him thinking for a moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the kids, the kids from last night. Right, yeah, okay, all right. Then if you want the kids, yeah, I can tell you where to find them, but I'll tell you what, you got to do something for me.
2407.16 2417.12 speaker1  on his double-barreled shotgun. Yeah, I'll do something for you. I'll do something for you right now, and it's not kill you.
2414.48 2427.64 speaker3  But unfortunately, what has not happened yet is that I've not promised to cut off your balls,
2422.64 2493.12 speaker2  He said, look, no, no, no, let's make a deal here, all right? I know, I know who's got your kids. I can make everything right for you, but, but, but, and you can see gears kind of clicking over in his head as he's saying this. Yeah, all right, look, there's a guy who's got your kids. He's got them in another house. I'll tell you what, yeah, you let me phone him up. I'll get him to go over there. Yeah, he'll let the kids out for you. But what you got to do for me is, yeah, you look handy with those guns, with those knives, whatever. Yeah, I mean, when he goes there to let your kids out, you do whatever you want with him. Yeah, I mean, you want to kill someone over this. He's the one who took your kids. Everything's fine, everything's great. You're saying that this guy is behind the kidnapping.
2492.12 2527.04 speaker3  And you had nothing to do with it. They just came to your fucking house. They just used your property. Why don't you tell us what this fucking canister is that we found in your basement? What if we do though? What if we open it right above your belly button? Yeah, how about that? Or do we pour this canister in your fucking abdomen? Does someone want to make an intimidate roll here?
2525.80 2542.04 speaker2  for an intimidate roll. as you are holding this canister above his belly button,
2539.56 2544.76 speaker3  Okay, that's just another D10? Yeah.
2543.72 2550.04 speaker2  Yeah, it's another D10 and you take that as your 10's result if it's better.
2548.76 2556.72 speaker3  No, it's five. Same thing.
2554.44 2561.40 speaker2  and turn that into a success if you want.
2558.84 2572.16 speaker3  I will spend a seven of my 20 luck.
2570.52 2583.80 speaker2  and he says, look, fellas, you don't know what you're doing with those things. Just don't let them out of there, okay? All right, I mean, I'll take you to your kids.
2582.96 2589.16 speaker3  Why don't you tell us
2586.60 2593.24 speaker2  You wouldn't believe me if I told you, all right?
2590.24 2606.68 speaker3  Do you believe that my knife is still on your balls?
2605.24 2638.84 speaker2  I'll tell you what I know, but look, you're not gonna believe any of this. Actually, I think out of all the pre-gen characters, no, no, you don't. So no, I mean, you may have heard a couple of the people around the camp, maybe Maureen Frayne or Carl Rothstein mention him, Heard the name?
2638.00 2645.32 speaker3  What of it?
2643.88 2726.52 speaker2  Don't ask me how it works. Yeah, Sedgwick, he's the one who knows all that stuff. I don't know, I know how to switch it on. That's about it. But there's this machine and you turn it on and I don't know, he says something about higher realms, higher dimensions, something like that. All I know is that there are these things on the other side these creatures and he points at the canister and it's like we go fishing for them. We get those, we get the good ones, we put them in the canister, those ones we can use. And when we use them, you put them inside someone and it's like they feed on them. They feed on something inside them. But if you're fast, if you're clever, if you get one that's just fed and then you put it inside yourself, it's like everything that it can't digest itself goes into you.
2723.76 2736.24 speaker1  Does it, is it full and then it leaves? With the forceps?
2733.20 2756.92 speaker2  Well, that's again, that's what the forceps are for. You don't want to lose control of these things.
2754.08 2780.92 speaker3  No, we're trying to stop this fucking thing. The second we found out about this shit, we thought it was fucked up and we tried to stop it. That's the difference between us and you.
2778.40 2786.88 speaker2  going Sedgwick just got me to drive them.
2783.84 2824.32 speaker3  Did you get the bugs in your feet or whatever? They went in the doc's feet. After they fed on people in the Hooverville? I've had enough to blow this guy's brains out. He seems to me like a willing participant.
2823.36 2834.36 speaker2  Trigger pulled.
2832.80 2839.48 speaker3  Yeah, it's a good fight, yeah.
2836.04 2861.34 speaker2  As you blow Casper Brinks' brains out all over his expensive silk sheets. we were about to not disturb.
2859.74 2884.66 speaker4  Well, we don't want to be rude. Shh. Wow.
2881.50 2934.10 speaker2  gets shredded into just so much meat, bits of him splatter across the four-poster bed and blood pools into the sheets around as his carcass just gives its last few twitches on the bed. of cold blooded murder. in which case let's have a D6 sand roll for each one of you.
2933.06 2964.82 speaker4  Ah, six. I got a five.
2961.94 3078.10 speaker2  the only three player characters in the scene, go into a bout of badness at the same time. for what happens if a character on their own has a bout of madness, but just apply it to all three of you. So I think given the shock of what's happened there, and the fact that you perhaps didn't anticipate just what the consequence of this perhaps rash action was, basically find yourself wandering through the Hooverville, just not really quite able to understand how you got there. You don't have the shotgun anymore. You don't know what the hell happened to that. It could be anywhere at this stage. The three of you are still covered with a spray of blood from Brink's exploding corpse. until, let's say, Professor Rothstein just sees these three figures come back into the camp. You're there by the campfire with a few others having what passes for coffee there. And you see, yeah, the three who went off earlier in search of the kids coming back. They are, like I say, covered in blood and some stuff that maybe isn't blood. wedged in bits of their clothing. And each of them just has this vacant look about their faces.
3075.46 3084.78 speaker3  I'm looking around at the other people sitting with me and like wide-eyed.
3081.22 3119.26 speaker2  Yeah, they're all looking at these three in alarm as well. As Dolan stands there, there's something that just falls off the lapel of his rather tattered coat and lands on the ground. Something kind of gray and spongy that just bounces on the ground
3116.66 3147.82 speaker4  I think Nathaniel would like kind of eagerly grab it shaky-handed. Are you okay? Sure, sure, sure, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
3146.98 3184.06 speaker3  Sure. You mean like in your tent or something? Dolan makes a comment like, to the people around the campfire.
3180.66 3195.62 speaker2  towards his sort of lean-to shack
3193.38 3209.10 speaker4  Nathaniel Coombs is gonna try and find just the nearest seat that he can sit in and contemplate his existence now as he looks into his cup of bad coffee.
3206.90 3244.30 speaker1  and you just hear from the other side of the tarp this dry retching from outside and he kinda limps and slowly wiping at his mouth. And then you see his left index finger is just going wild. The rest of him is very, very steady almost, like not moving at all, scared to move but his left index finger just keeps moving.
3240.26 3257.46 speaker3  and he's just looking for any kind of water basin If he can't find it, he just pours his coffee out on his hands and starts rubbing that.
3255.02 3263.98 speaker2  Yeah, I mean, you can start getting yourself a bit cleaner at least sort of get some of the bits out of your hair
3262.70 3274.70 speaker3  Come in, have a seat.
3272.38 3283.70 speaker4  and it's a name that I've heard you say before.
3279.54 3309.42 speaker1  to Carl Rothstein, grabs just blood-soaked hand on your lapel and just holds on less aggressive than desperate and looks at you with pleading eyes. What?
3307.90 3328.34 speaker3  Well, that's good. Listen, doc, they're putting bugs in people's bellies, they're laying eggs, they're eating them, weird shit's going on. What do you know about it? Yeah, you.
3326.90 3330.22 speaker1  Stalling, no, I'm-
3328.34 3355.38 speaker3  Yeah, what did you just walk into the situation
3353.70 3363.38 speaker4  and I've heard you mention it before. Who is he to you? I was friends with Professor Hawks, but he disappeared.
3361.74 3374.90 speaker3  This might sound like a funny question, but when he disappeared, did it feel like any of your greatness disappeared with him?
3374.02 3381.02 speaker2  that he disappeared. He disappeared something like eight years ago.
3379.26 3390.66 speaker3  I'll forget you ever even asked it. Sustained.
3386.66 3409.98 speaker4  I mean, he used to live in the Prospect Estate with Crawley and was last seen there. And he's looking at his other guys.
3407.26 3415.34 speaker3  from a different dimension, you know, is like.
3413.30 3425.70 speaker1  Oh, fucking shit. Nice. Do we at least have the forceps?
3423.58 3436.70 speaker4  We must've left it all back there. Oh God. I don't know where we would've, why we would've, I don't.
3434.18 3459.34 speaker1  Frederick Mellon the first checks his pockets for keys to a big black Cadillac And I, oh, I passed. I was really scared, I was gonna say that and then still fail, 50.
3456.46 3465.26 speaker2  Then yeah, you do check your pockets and you do find the keys to the Cadillac in there.
3464.42 3517.74 speaker1  Yes. and we followed that big black caddy out there. Ida told us at the Blue Star Diner, that's what led us all the way out there and then we decided we heard the man sleeping and we thought, oh no, forget it, you're home to Bel Air. And we said, let's go upstairs and maybe check on him. But then we killed him and now he took his car. Okay, so if we have his car, we'll be able to get back there pretty easily because we need that canister and we probably need the shotgun. Maybe he's got other stuff too. We can disguise ourselves with his clothes and maybe other guns that he might have, recheck his basement perhaps, but maybe we don't have time because we need to get the prospect. Oh, fuck Carl, are you gonna come with us?
3513.46 3534.98 speaker4  surrounded by these men covered in goo and blood and who knows what. And he's wide-eyed the entire time that Frederick is saying that. I'm not sure.
3532.18 3540.14 speaker1  Dr. Coombs, please tell him about the creatures. Tell him about the creatures. Tell him how fucked up it was. The creatures, listen, Carl,
3538.38 3545.22 speaker3  the long and short of it is we've killed tonight and we'll kill again.
3543.98 3564.82 speaker4  Who did you kill? Whoa, what? Are you serious? Carl, do you know where Prospect is?
3562.62 3575.58 speaker2  It's a couple of miles down the road towards Arkham.
3574.62 3587.06 speaker1  I mean the keys.
3582.82 3598.42 speaker4  Maybe you can fill me in on some stuff on the way. I doubt it.
3596.10 3605.30 speaker2  and the shanty town.
3602.66 3626.18 speaker1  then Frederick turns back and is like, hey, and if we're super lucky, then maybe in the trunk, there's a shotgun and a canister of void fish. I was just calling them void fish. What a void fish. Well, they lay eggs.
3625.34 3635.34 speaker4  All right. Okay, I'm going to sit in the passenger seat and you just tell me when you're ready. Oh, that's good.
3633.50 3642.34 speaker3  So I'm going to sit in the back in the first seat.
3639.54 3649.46 speaker2  So whoever's got the lowest luck out of the four of you guests make a luck roll.
3646.82 3652.98 speaker1  He spent seven on the 20 he had. Oh God. So he's got 13.
3651.94 3665.42 speaker4  I'm not sure how much, cause I got a bonus for a little bit. Did that get taken away from me? Okay. Then I've got 25.
3664.42 3672.22 speaker3  85.
3670.46 3690.78 speaker2  there's no sound of the shotgun, but you do see that the canister is there in the back seat. At some point.
3687.62 3696.98 speaker4  Is it, is it sitting open as we get in the car or is it? Oh yes. Is it resealed? It's sitting up.
3693.42 3703.86 speaker2  No, no, it's sitting there on its side in the footwell, the top of it off. Yeah.
3702.38 3715.58 speaker3  these creatures in the car? You certainly can. Like lurking under the seat.
3711.18 3735.38 speaker2  You do see something gray as wriggling underneath one of the seats. You also notice a trail going through the undergrowth away from where the car is parked,
3732.86 3739.94 speaker4  That is very, very not good.
3737.66 3755.58 speaker3  we let it escape, but we do have the canister, so we can't recontain it. Are there forceps there? No. Doc, you took a Hippocratic oath, so I nominate you to grab the creature when we find it.
3752.90 3763.82 speaker4  I'm finally like soaking in some blood that was on it and like feeling wet. And I hear that. Whatever you need, just.
3762.58 3771.38 speaker3  It's for mankind. Okay.
3767.54 3775.26 speaker1  we're talking to both Doc Combs and Doc Rothstein at the same time.
3774.42 3782.18 speaker4  Thanks.
3778.78 3791.30 speaker3  I'm not gonna go around thinking of two names for doctors.
3788.10 3811.46 speaker2  At this stage, it is beginning to get dark. So are you following the trail of this thing back towards the camp? Are you staying in the car and trying to deal with the thing that's loose there? Are you finding another way of getting into prospect? What's your plan?
3809.26 3820.06 speaker4  I think it's this thing that brings these creatures in. He might have more sophisticated ways of capturing them.
3817.22 3837.42 speaker1  Otherwise, the little fingers that go out in the toes that spread their little wormy ways into the world around it will just continue to grow and grow. If you cut off one finger, then you got nine left. But if you cut off two hands at the same time, then you got no fingers.
3835.98 3865.38 speaker3  before it infects the camp. I think we should probably help the people. It doesn't seem like a finger. It seems more like its own thing that can operate independently of a hand. Maybe we should help the people real quick. Because the big fancy place, that's not going nowhere. But this thing's on the move.
3863.50 3885.30 speaker2  You've noticed, certainly, there's some of the undergrowth that's been disturbed and it is leaving a fairly subtle trail of slime, which you've managed to spot. Like I say, it is beginning to get dark at this stage. You're gonna have to try to find it fairly quickly. Otherwise, you're going to lose it in the dark.
3883.94 3893.30 speaker1  but I'm easily persuadable. Let's search for this thing.
3889.38 3957.10 speaker2  and it goes up to one of the tents. And you realize, yeah, it's the tent that Nancy Carver was in earlier, the woman who'd seen the weird stuff last night and had gone into some kind of fugue stated as a result. on the side of her tent. And then there's just this wet spot in the fabric of the tent as if it's moved through it. And as you shout her name, she stirs a little bit and her first reaction is a sort of whimpering sound.
3953.58 3962.26 speaker1  It's Fredrick Mellon I, Carl Rothstein, Thomas Dolan, and Daniel Coombs.
3960.98 3965.62 speaker3  We're here to check up on you, Nancy.
3964.46 3971.26 speaker4  I just need to sleep.
3968.90 3986.38 speaker1  But we're worried about a situation that has come to become a present issue.
3981.38 4009.42 speaker2  and she staggers up to the door of her tent and opens it up. And yeah, she's looking very pale in the fading light. Her eyes are a bit unfocused, her hands trembling as it's holding onto the tent flap. What is it? What do you want?
4007.18 4020.30 speaker3  Excuse us for one moment, Nats. Could we huddle real quick? So she's got it, right? She's, it's, that's- Yeah, it's inside of Lee.
4019.46 4027.54 speaker1  Yeah.
4025.78 4033.26 speaker3  You can pick your own name for it.
4031.30 4095.42 speaker4  but the problem is they don't leave a sign that they've entered the body. It's almost like it creates a camouflage of the wound. A wet door. How do you know she's got it? It makes you look like that. Look at her. Oh, okay, so do we kill her? So there's a way to do it safely. Doink doink doink doink.
4092.62 4100.94 speaker2  Dr. Coombs would have something suitable in his medical shack.
4098.58 4106.06 speaker4  And I do, I run back and I also, if I can find a pair of gloves, I'd like to grab some gloves.
4103.66 4128.58 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, you can do that. As you go in, Maureen Frain is coming out of, well, she was obviously sleeping before and her eyes open up as you come into the shack. And she looks like, oh, Dr. Coombs, have you got news? Have you found Esther? We're working on it.
4126.74 4142.14 speaker4  We don't have any reason to believe something bad has happened per se yet at all. And we're gonna find her.
4139.74 4150.62 speaker2  as if to try to come and help you and then just collapses back into it.
4147.74 4157.26 speaker4  That's what's gonna make you feel better eventually.
4155.50 4164.66 speaker2  We're on it.
4163.38 4172.02 speaker4  When I get back to the tent, I say, there's a chance Maureen has it too back at my place. But I got the forceps and the gloves.
4170.94 4180.54 speaker1  and find the wet door?
4176.74 4185.58 speaker3  and find the people who are doing this.
4183.14 4191.18 speaker1  that we needed to fix the situation here at home. And now as soon as we find the situation,
4189.34 4197.70 speaker3  we need to track down the creature. We found where it is. We know exactly where it is.
4196.14 4208.98 speaker1  and then find another person. Then when we get back, it's somewhere else. Although I guess it would have given that person strength.
4207.58 4210.94 speaker2  Yeah.
4208.98 4228.38 speaker4  Probably actually. Yeah. just kind of like holding her up and taking all of it in with her too.
4226.78 4238.06 speaker2  What are they talking about?
4236.70 4249.66 speaker4  And do you think it's gotten to me? Oh, I think I might have it too. You'll be okay.
4246.54 4262.50 speaker3  but we gotta figure out how to get it out of you. That's why I think, Freddie, that we need to go, you know, like you said earlier to the source. I hope you know this isn't a flip flop.
4261.02 4266.78 speaker1  I was right at the beginning too.
4265.74 4274.58 speaker2  what do I do about it?
4271.74 4288.54 speaker4  but just so you know, you've got time. I've seen this before. There's no reason to think that you're in any immediate danger. We'll figure out how to get it out of you and then we'll get it out of you.
4284.50 4296.94 speaker3  It just takes your potential and your ability and your joy and it gives it to somebody of a better social standing than you. Is this what-
4296.10 4299.50 speaker1  Yeah, is this what happened? Before he became Crumbly Dust?
4298.14 4311.46 speaker2  This is what happened to Harold. I heard, I heard-
4308.94 4321.10 speaker3  Yeah, we believe we've caught it pre-face crumble. So you just hold on tight, Matt, take a little nap and we're gonna get you fixed up.
4318.42 4331.38 speaker4  That's what the crumbling was from a lack of water. So just make sure you're keeping the fluid intake.
4327.94 4340.78 speaker1  if you see a little buggy crawl out of you- Stop that. Maybe don't-
4337.90 4342.90 speaker2  None of this seems to be comforting her in the slightest.
4342.06 4345.74 speaker1  Scott, really?
4344.26 4354.34 speaker3  so it's not really my fault.
4349.74 4359.50 speaker4  you grab it so that you can identify what snake bit you.
4355.78 4370.54 speaker3  Well, doc, like we said, you don't wanna grab it. It can move through your skin. It will just in a you if you grab it, so. Then how do you-
4366.02 4381.46 speaker2  On stage, Nancy is just curled up on the pile of newspapers and old grags that she's using as a bed and is in the fetal position and is just curled up around herself, shaking.
4379.78 4401.46 speaker4  You're doing it right, Nancy, that's good. We'll be back as soon as we can and we'll get this figured out for you. Don't worry, you're in capable hands here with Dr. Coons. And Nancy, remember, you still owe me a can of beans,
4399.54 4424.74 speaker3  Yes, that's what they call us.
4420.86 4440.54 speaker4  and, you know, it's treating me, you know, ill enough. He laughs and looks around like very sad. We should get to Prospect.
4438.70 4447.14 speaker2  Nancy Carver's spirit,
4445.38 4464.26 speaker1  That was a very good idea.
4462.02 4478.26 speaker2  one of these things loosened the car as well. You did see it wriggling under one of the seats.
4476.42 4481.06 speaker4  Well, let's have a group luck roll
4479.74 4489.42 speaker2  So that's just Thomas.
4485.66 4494.82 speaker3  21, so I've been so close without that modifier.
4491.70 4514.82 speaker2  In which case, hmm, no. By the time you get back to the car, I think it is quite gloomy now, but you don't see any trace of it. And now I'm gloomy, was probably about the size of your forearm. Oh, Jesus.
4513.34 4557.70 speaker4  Okay, so not too small. I'm gonna get in the driver's seat this time. When you're ready, I will drive there. Oh, whoopsie. It comes back to me that you were covered in blood and stuff and I'm scared, very scared again. Toss me the keys. I'm like shaking and start the car. I feel like I'm being taken hostage almost. I want to note that I still got forceps with me. So if anything goes down, I can still maybe help.
4554.54 4564.58 speaker2  for Dr. Rothstein to drive you to Prospect, because like I say, it is just a couple of miles down the road.
4562.66 4574.18 speaker1  as we're passing Blue Star Diner, should we, boys, should we stop and grab that shotgun at Greenleys
4572.22 4589.46 speaker3  Well, from, I mean, from one point of view, it's already served its purpose in the story, but it could be,
4586.62 4604.34 speaker2  after murdering Mr. Brink, are you really happy going back to the murder scene?
4603.18 4607.82 speaker4  You can hold it. I'd rather not.
4606.98 4612.46 speaker3  That's smart. That's why I adopted.
4611.54 4627.94 speaker4  with it as well. So preferably not. but I don't really remember what happened after all that. There's a chance that we left the shotgun in the woods somewhere on our way back. I don't know where it might even be in there.
4626.30 4630.86 speaker3  Let's just go get some answers.
4628.90 4645.70 speaker2  It is almost dark now
4644.22 4649.82 speaker4  Yeah, Prospect, huh?
4648.46 4720.38 speaker2  towards Prospect. So this is another one of these estates like Greenlee's that's set back from the road. This one though does have a stone wall around the grounds. You pull the car up to the gates outside and the gates are a bit rusted. There is still in Gothic script written over the top And in the dying light, you can see the perhaps ruins or not quite ruins, but the abandoned house itself up at the top of the slope. The grounds in this light look incredibly overgrown. make out some outbuildings, but you're not quite sure what they are. The gates themselves have got a chain and a padlock around them. While the gates are fairly rusty,
4715.38 4737.18 speaker1  And you know, ever since they got this new lock mechanism, gizmo technology, it takes maybe a second or third try here and there, but I'm pretty good with these and starts rooting around in his clothes, finding his like lock picking set.
4734.98 4751.94 speaker2  to see what you can pop it easily. A 10 on a 70. They clearly used a cheap lock here. So you pretty much just slide the picks in and the whole thing pops open. And he turns around and he's like,
4750.06 4769.70 speaker1  that's one of the most advanced locks that exists here in this time period. And your boy, Frederick Mellon, the voice, got it while winking at you, huh? And he winks.
4767.30 4775.58 speaker3  So did I, I just saw it on my character sheet.
4773.18 4786.94 speaker2  Are you leaving the car on the road? Are you driving it up towards the house?
4781.94 4822.62 speaker1  and Casper seemed to have an issue with Sedgwick. I think he wanted us to kill him, honestly. He seemed like he really would have been cool with us knocking him out. So if I were Sedgwick and I saw Casper bring his car coming up, I would feel uneasy about that and negative. And then the fact that he's not even in the car, maybe we could play it off like we killed him for Sedgwick. Like we heard that they were having issues and we wanted to join in on the madness. What do you guys think?
4820.74 4827.50 speaker4  This is Austin Hawk's house. Maybe he's a live-in helper with the machine.
4826.58 4834.98 speaker1  With a machine like that, I don't think that the man who knows how it works
4831.82 4848.10 speaker4  I'm worried about the going in part, but it would be nice to have a going out ride. Does that make sense? I'm worried that it's really conspicuous for our car to go up the driveway, but I'd love to have a car ready to go down that driveway when we were trying to leave this place.
4846.94 4865.22 speaker3  It's the Depression. I think going up in this nice car gives us some good cover on the way up there and gives us an escape route. I think we take the car. We just back it in.
4862.26 4896.14 speaker2  I mean, it's going to be quite difficult to back it in because this is a winding driveway and it's quite badly overgrown. The weeds are quite high on the other side. It's going to be tricky because with it getting dark, you probably want the headlights pointing in front of you at the moment to avoid crashing into a tree or a sapling or something. I can give you a drive auto roll just to reverse it in there, but it is the harder way of doing it.
4894.54 4917.34 speaker4  There's surely a roundabout it, but these estates all have those trees. I'm a good driver. I'll back it in. Okay.
4915.14 4920.86 speaker3  Like surely he wouldn't just say that.
4918.82 4925.90 speaker4  It's not on my character sheet, so I think it's just a 20. Yeah, so that means it's 20.
4925.06 4936.90 speaker1  Sweet. You dick.
4932.70 5015.94 speaker2  So you reverse the car up and about halfway up, like I say, it's very badly overgrown and you just misjudge it slightly and you've gone off the path or at least off the driveway and you're reversed into some soft ground and the car is now sort of, yeah, So you're getting out to try to put something under the back tires so you can get out. It's now pretty dark. It hasn't been raining today, but as you brush up against something undergrowth, some of it does feel uncomfortably moist and you can hear just the sounds of things rustling around in the undergrowth, things you can't see in the darkness.
5015.10 5027.22 speaker3  Okay. He starts running when he hears the Slytherin.
5023.90 5056.34 speaker2  The other three of you are still there at the car. So is it Frederick Mellon I and Dr. Coombs trying to find solid stuff to put under the tire, a couple of times, yeah, you can feel things in the darkness just kind of slithering across the back of your hand.
5053.78 5072.50 speaker4  Nathaniel, when one of those slithers perfectly across his hand, he jerks back. For Frederick, there's stuff out here. There's that crickling sound. That's not squirrels. It was slimy.
5069.82 5084.10 speaker1  but eh, we got to keep going. We got to make sure the car gets out.
5080.46 5109.90 speaker2  to put under the tire, part of that is going to involve lifting the car up enough to get the stuff under the tire. What I suggest then is one of you give me a strength roll just to see whether you can pull this off.
5109.06 5116.78 speaker4  Yes. Oh, nice.
5113.66 5170.18 speaker2  under there and sure enough, when Dr. Rothstein starts up the car, it just pulls forward onto the track. Yes. Mr. Dolan was running up towards the house in the gloom. As you make your way towards the building, from the undergrowth, just after your right, you hear a sound. The sound, you're not quite sure what it is at first, but as you move past, you can hear a sort of a sound, and it's getting quite dark.
5169.34 5212.46 speaker3  Hello? but there's some freaky shit out here. All right, and he goes into the, he goes towards the sound. Nice.
5208.18 5220.90 speaker2  you sort of just catch sight in the gloom of Thomas disappearing off the path into the undergrowth
5218.66 5227.90 speaker4  Oh, Thomas, there's stuff out there, I wouldn't... Yeah, that's why I ran,
5226.90 5240.98 speaker3  Wicked scared. Nice.
5239.22 5273.10 speaker2  so you've got a bit of light. In the little bit of light you have, you see the form of someone lying just on the ground. You can just make out a human shape. It's too big to be one of the children. It looks like an adult, probably a man. He's lying on the ground and he seems to be trembling and he's still making that sound, that...
5270.74 5282.70 speaker3  You grab a stick off the ground.
5278.18 5286.98 speaker2  and he doesn't seem to react.
5285.14 5293.06 speaker0  In fact, actually, as you poke him,
5290.26 5333.46 speaker2  And as he arrives, we're adjusting to the moon that's now risen a bit more. You can make out some of the contours of his face. His face is quite wasted. He looks really drawn and sick. His eyes are absolutely wide. And as he's staring at you, you see his right eyelid bulge slightly. And then something crawls out from underneath it, something wriggling that's just glinting in the moonlight and crawls across his eyeball and across his face and then just disappears up his nose.
5332.62 5353.42 speaker3  Let's have a sanity roll first. And your sanity is? And I took, I don't remember how much damage I took, six. So my sanity is 34. So I passed.
5351.42 5386.54 speaker2  And so, yeah, I mean, you still, like you say, throw the stick and sort of back off in horror, just almost tumbling over on the ground in your speed to get away. through the undergrowth, you can feel sort of the wetness of these strands of weeds as they brush against your face. And you think you can feel things wriggling on them as you brush past them. And then, yeah, you just stumble out onto the track again as the others are there.
5385.50 5394.14 speaker3  he's real messed up. Let's get to prospect proper and solve this mystery. What do you think?
5393.18 5400.14 speaker4  Do I need to? Not right now.
5397.14 5414.30 speaker3  He's got bugs coming out of his head. I think we gotta find a more holistic solution
5412.30 5486.94 speaker2  further up the track from here. you can see that there are a couple of outbuildings. Well, first of all, let's just make clear, there is no artificial light here whatsoever. The only light you have is the moonlight. It looks like there's the remains of a sort of extensional wing on the far side of it from here. The front door looks like it's a jar, but off to the side, there are a few outbuildings. There are some things that look like sheds, albeit large sheds, but there's another building that's a bit odder than that. It's a stone building that is around maybe about 10 yards in diameter, maybe a bit larger, a one-story building
5484.98 5501.06 speaker3  before you decided to check on that. 80.
5498.66 5516.22 speaker2  you weren't in your proper state of mind before. It's been a day full of shocks. At this stage, obviously it has occurred to you that it would be a really good idea to have light sources, but your mind just wasn't in that space earlier. Typical Freddy.
5515.38 5521.22 speaker1  All right, well...
5519.70 5529.22 speaker4  This is where we're going. I forgot to announce when we got here. Thank you so much, Karl Rothstein. Thank you for all your help.
5528.30 5533.66 speaker1  Jesus fuck.
5530.46 5539.78 speaker4  what that weird round building there might be? Oh, let me think.
5538.62 5565.58 speaker2  and not that you ever saw it, but it was something that Dr. Hawkes had talked about, that he was going to build a separate laboratory, and you think that might be it? I mean, it still looks like a fairly unusual building. It doesn't necessarily look like what you'd think for a lab, but maybe that's it.
5561.58 5574.34 speaker4  I remember him talking about building a lab. It looks like it could be that, but I'm turning Irish. I don't know.
5573.34 5588.54 speaker3  It's wicked hot. in a world like this?
5584.98 5597.46 speaker4  That might be where equipment is for this.
5595.34 5613.58 speaker1  I think we figure out how to help and try to stop whatever's happening first, because if we find the children first, then we would just be carrying or bringing along children
5612.66 5621.54 speaker4  Good point, good point. Speaking of carrying things, shouldn't we carry that guy to the lab? No.
5620.70 5629.66 speaker3  No, man. My whole point- The whole idea is to find the shit to help him. And then not have dead weight with us.
5626.94 5635.58 speaker4  If it's in the lab, then it saves us a trip.
5633.14 5646.86 speaker3  full of bugs by hand back here. Okay. After we just fled from him and Tara. What about you? You're a doctor, don't you have an oath?
5644.74 5657.66 speaker4  but when you said the bugs thing, I've seen what those bugs can do. I'm not touching it until we figure out a way
5656.14 5663.38 speaker3  This has nothing to do with me. A phys-iks-ion. You're a doctor.
5661.70 5664.98 speaker1  You said you're a doctor, so.
5663.38 5673.54 speaker3  Okay, let's go to the lab.
5669.70 5701.22 speaker2  Yeah, it's got a fairly heavy iron door on it, black iron door, that again is locked. You can also see that in the moonlight, there are some fairly heavy looking cables, half buried running across the ground, that are running over towards the two shanks. If only we had the shotgun,
5698.62 5714.10 speaker1  but it'd be nice to knock out some of these cables and people. with a 16 on a 70.
5712.26 5760.14 speaker2  I mean, this is a bit more of a serious lock. It takes you a minute or two, but even then, you pop it open and yeah, the doors open and inside everything is completely dark. There's no light in here. You can hear towards the back, a sloshing of liquid. There's a strange smell in the air and you can see shapes just all around in the gloom.
5753.14 5767.14 speaker0  In the moment it's hard to count your blessings, so we long for days gone past us. Grief and strife, bloody, that's real life.
