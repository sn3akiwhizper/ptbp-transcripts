0.00 27.00 speaker0  Y'all, I'm so fuckin' pumped. This is so fuckin' tasty. Even though y'all are listening to me from 26 years in the past, I know that this very special nice episode number will bring you to a delicious audio climax like it does me.
22.70 35.60 speaker1  From the Station 694.2 PTBP,
34.00 302.20 speaker0  Let's get it, y'all. Let's intertwine, like the good numbers 6 and 9, and bring each other to a new plane of existence. Where pleasure is the only thing we can feel, as we become one sexy oily blob together in the corners of space-time. Uh... So anyway, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mandy. At SketchyPixels, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. They write, Hello, Wolf the Dog. Ah, wooooo! but I'm hoping to get a regular group here in contention to play. I have experience running a couple games, and would love to host a new group since my last group kind of vanished. No one's really showed up yet, and the town has seemed kind of empty lately. But I'm sure it'll pick up soon. Anyone interested in playing can come down to the library pretty much whenever. I'm there all the time. At all times. Just waitin' with my dice. Waiting. Always waiting. what kind of character would you make? I also wanted to return shout-out my very good friend Disa, who shouted me out the other day. Thanks for getting me into the show and for generally being an awesome friend. Thanks for writin' in, Mandy. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. He is very strong, very sexy, and very smart, and very addicted to trash can eateries. That one was a stretch. And my producer definitely wrote that and made me read it, or he was gonna incinerate all my trash. Now, uh, we're on Patreon. Goddamn, I wish I knew how to get on the internet. Sounds wild, y'all. Now it's time for the news. Bradley Cooper found Jack Russell's go-bag in his floorboards while Walter and Alan Grimes watched him on their television. about vaccinations needed to go abroad. Charles Digby had a short and confusing conversation with a young girl on a walkie-talkie he found under his bed. What the fuck is going on? like calm and comfy and shit, or like the good number 69. but I do know universal healthcare shouldn't be divisive. Sex work is work. Food waste and the existence of billionaires have the same solution. And this brand new track that I'm premiering here for y'all is a bit on the nose. It's Dream Girl with Pretty Sexual. This is real love dream I knew I'd make you be foolish
298.70 312.10 speaker2  We might actually just upload a video of us like larping it. Yeah, it'll just be in character won't be like it's me and you
310.80 327.60 speaker1  when I signed up for this podcast. I knew that there would be some light sex involved.

350.30 359.70 speaker2  narrative of a bad memory that is that is brought you to calm comfy
357.40 374.70 speaker1  Yeah, it was something that related to how we got here.
370.40 408.50 speaker2  but pretty much always and we're doing a Saturday. It's brunch time. It should have been. Saturday record session is going to get a little silly maybe Joe's Roger Fairfield goes to sleep. He drifts into a deep slumber sitting on a chair book on your chest learning about the flora of the area around calm comfy campground. Yeah, there's plants.
405.90 417.30 speaker1  You didn't talk about what all the trees were here.
415.80 431.70 speaker2  Yeah, so far so good. Cool. There's a lot of flowers in that book that cover many many different species and different shrubberies and bushes.
430.90 436.80 speaker1  has plants.
434.10 447.70 speaker2  Just how many just how many different species.
436.90 452.40 speaker1  Yes, and so as you fall into this this sweet sweet nap night nap the
451.90 462.70 speaker2  Sure. Why not? I would like you to just give me a rundown from a first-person perspective of a bad memory that brought you here.
461.70 481.50 speaker1  Oh shit. This isn't how I thought this was going to happen. Okay. Okay. I thought for sure I'd be talking to somebody about it.
479.40 508.00 speaker2  I had to just go into the kitchen. I don't know if you could hear the bleed through on the mics of Justin and Thomas and Luke having just a joyful conversation. I was so confused to find them standing all in the same room. It's wild so strange.
507.70 606.00 speaker1  Yes. and studying and I'm reading my textbooks and I'm falling asleep and I'm waking up and I'm going to the gym and I'm going to class and I'm going home and studying and I'm falling asleep in just one day on the way to class. I ran into this girl and I mean ran into her. She stopped me in my tracks because she was looking down and I was looking up and boom and her bracelet went flying and my glasses flew off and I gathered all those things up and she put the glasses on my face. I something about something about her face that I didn't go to class that day. you we were kind of inseparable after that. We she was she was not like me at all. If she saw a cool car, she would run over and ask the person in the parking lot. do that. But it's just because I wasn't that interested but she's interested. She's she's interested in everything. It's she's always asking stuff. She's always asking about my life. She's asking about my work and I don't like to talk about that very often. I don't know. I'm an archaeologist and I feel like everybody would find that boring. I don't like to talk about my work because I see eyes glaze over but she would always ask and I would go and tell her
603.80 628.10 speaker2  What what did you what are you working on today?
626.20 631.70 speaker1  It's just I'm interested. Really? Of course.
630.30 640.20 speaker2  It's it's our life. It is it's cool. It's an old. What's it called?
638.40 641.20 speaker1  We don't really have a term for it.
640.20 695.80 speaker2  That's spooky. She freezes completely. sound you'd heard birds chirping second ago. They're no longer chirping. You heard a car was literally driving by at that exact moment. He kind of clants out the window and it is stopped in the middle of the road and walking into the room is a man with black dress shoes gray slacks and a white shirt. It's James the executive director of calm comfy campground. So Roger, what would you want to change in this moment?
693.50 739.50 speaker1  that that that moment was was nice. It was it was all the times after that that she she just kept asking kept asking kept trying to tell me have me tell her more it became exhausting. to her. I would get I would get snippy sometimes when she would ask about my work and one night I yelled at her. hot. We laying in our separate beds.
737.70 753.50 speaker2  Well, it's 26 years ago. Obviously, I love Lucy style bedroom. Yeah. Yeah. single detail.
751.20 760.90 speaker1  It's dusty and there's rocks and sometimes.
757.10 775.60 speaker2  looks at you with these big eyes and you see a little bit of the light just die in them. Life freezes once again and James walks into the room.
773.10 783.50 speaker1  No, it's not fun to see it again.
779.40 791.60 speaker2  or was it just a repetition that led you down this aggressive pathway?
788.20 807.70 speaker1  I used to live every everything about her is the antithesis of me. She likes to do things and I do the same things.
805.40 846.00 speaker2  in the shower last night and I practiced it. Oh, man. I literally I think it was just calling somebody a chump. I think it was shut it jump. Your body wash is like ball episode 69 Thomas. That's my second name and favorite number after the drug number. Yeah.
844.90 868.60 speaker3  too distracting. You can't focus on the pleasure. You're giving. pleasure you're getting because you're focused on the pleasure you're giving I tend to focus on the pleasure. I'm giving Zach. So that's well, that's what I was trying to believe on.
865.60 902.60 speaker2  All right, so I we went over this with Joe but I asked you And so we're just going to jump right on in as you fall asleep in your very nice pajamas silken high-thread count jammies. Your mind goes blank for the first time all day. Not thinking about Cube not thinking about shades of white. That's such an ignorant thing to say. Well, I'm an ignorant boy.
898.80 1019.20 speaker3  I could show you color palettes that would blow your mind. I had a friend he considered me a friend. I didn't necessarily treat him like much of one but we met after college. This was 26 years ago. Not not like the 26 years ago. We might hypothetically be living in now. This was actually 26 years ago and it was a time for technology. We were just some California kids out there me Martin Cupertino and Bill Bosniak. and and we dreamed of building something big together. I was working for for a video game company called Campari. They came to us with a challenge if you could remove as many chips as possible from from the circuit board for their for the new video game, they would give you $50 a chip. No a hundred dollars a chip. I swear. I just read the Wikipedia on this so I know what I'm talking future, which is where I consider myself to be existing at all times spiritually. So Bill I knew he could he could take a crack at it. He could he could whittle down the chips on that circuit board where I couldn't and I promised him we'd split the reward evenly. He came back to me a few weeks later having removed 50 chips. That's $5,000 in 26 years ago money. That was a lot of money at the time. I took his design to Campari. They gave me the $5,000 and I told Bill that they had only given us $700. I gave him $350. And it haunts me.
1015.90 1038.90 speaker2  I thought we were supposed to get wasn't it was a hundred dollars a chip, right? This is I'm Bill.
1037.80 1059.70 speaker3  That that pans. I mean you did great work buddy, but they didn't give us the full 5,000. They only gave us $700.
1053.70 1090.60 speaker2  freezes Bill's face like it's been paused and walking into the room is a man in a white dress shirt gray slacks and black dress shoes. And it's James the executive director of calm comfy campground. anything. I've thought about that a lot.
1089.10 1115.10 speaker3  and keep all the money for myself. I use that to start our company the stock options. He got from that alone more than made up for it. I mean if I had had 350 extra bucks to put into that 26 years ago. That might be worth two or three points, you know on the stock these days. That's a few more million dollars for him for old Bill is
1114.50 1122.60 speaker2  later.
1118.60 1160.50 speaker3  might have been if I was honest with him over the 15 years or so of our professional Association. I've thought about both ways. What if I gave him his full amount? What if I gave him nothing neither option seems satisfactory? I wouldn't be where I was today without it. I guess I regret nothing.
1159.00 1175.10 speaker2  totally my dice bag. I forgot the rest of the Hello Dolly. I don't know the words.
1174.80 1179.30 speaker0  Yep.
1178.80 1264.60 speaker2  Yeah. Hello Dolly. Hello Dolly. You're my Dolly. obviously so Justin it's episode 69. bad memory prepared and we're going to dive into it as you fall asleep caffeine riddled mind racing, but tuckered out from a long day at calm comfy campground you get into bed after having a less than normal experience with a walkie-talkie under your bed. you sleep. and you find yourself amidst this memory.
1261.30 1454.40 speaker0  She warmed my heart in a way that no one else had since I was like a teenager or something. I don't think I've ever known a love like that in my entire life that made me want to cling to her all the harder. It was one of the first things we bought when we first moved in together after our first year of living with each other. up on other people's routines and whatnot. I noticed that she was running late from work more often. I told myself it was all fine. It'd be okay me and Rolo had the place to ourselves every now and then boys night in and all that Taco Tuesday with Rolo. Sure. Why not? She would tell me about these happy hour things with her co-workers. It was helping her network move up the ladder all that stuff a couple nights. She would get home real late. Then it started to spread to some weekend nights this drifted on for about a month. So I did what I'm good at. I started tailing her. I took some pictures of her with her friends co-workers whoever she was with I started keeping a folder with pictures and names to see if they matched with people from work like she had told me so one night I get a call from a client and I have to storm off somewhere to capture some pictures of someone in a timely manner. I get back home real late that night Sam is she's on the floor crying but furious looking at the pictures of her and her peers that I had taken my heart nearly stopped. I just about projectile vomit from the nerves. Everything was a fucking mess. I remember in this moment looking at my overweight cat Rolo and I could see in his eyes this feeling of like holy shit you fucked up guy. She yells at me now. I'm used to being yelled at my job doesn't always elicit joy from others, but this felt like the wrath of some kind of cruel dark God was coming my way her raised voice pierced my soul. I try to tell her that I was just worried about how she'd been spending more time away from me. I was just concerned about her really honest, but she could see right through my bullshit. She knew it was because I didn't trust her deep down that I have trouble trusting anyone. She said exactly that to me and I denied it. I get defensive. I start running down all the things I had seen her doing at what times and where I told her that I had a reason not to trust her. That's when she threw her coffee cup down on the floor next to all those fucking pictures. She started packing up her stuff in a hurry. She was out of there so fast the next morning. Just me my obese cat and one half of a matching set of coffee cups and those goddamn pictures that I never should have
1448.90 1499.60 speaker2  the world stops like someone paused the television. That morning you could hear the birds chirping dogs playing outside in the neighborhood. You could hear the city streets. But all of that is now completely silent and stepping into the room is a man wearing a white button-down shirt gray slacks and black dress shoes and it's James the executive director at calm comfy campground. Now if you if you could talk to this version of yourself right here, what would you say to him?
1496.10 1509.90 speaker0  You've ruined one of the best things you've ever had going in your life. You fucking fool.
1505.60 1527.00 speaker2  standing in your workroom your office holding your camera about to go out and tail Sam for the first time and you can see the look on your own face. had the opportunity, would you change it?
1523.10 1535.20 speaker0  I absolutely would I would I would do anything to undo what I did take the camera out of his hands.
1534.10 1544.40 speaker2  Yeah, is he like really stiff? Yeah.
1543.30 1552.40 speaker0  feisty angry. It's good. Now.
1548.30 1557.10 speaker2  What would you have to explain to this version of yourself in order to keep you from doing this again?
1556.10 1582.50 speaker0  You got to trust people. You can't just assume the worst in everybody even though that's your that's your day job. You can't do that with the people you love you have to assume the best out of the people you love.
1579.00 1617.00 speaker2  Are you ready for episode 69? I'm like a couple months. piercing blue baby eyes clothes or turn dark.
1613.20 1711.20 speaker3  really reading it or taking it in just kind of staring and he comes over to me and I hear noises from another room and he doesn't say anything. He just comes over and he places his finger underneath my chin and everything goes dark, but I'm not off. I can't move. I can't see but I can still hear the voices get closer and I hear Alan talk about selling me. I hear two men enter the room and I can feel them touching me and I feel their presence and I can tell they're looking me over and inspecting different parts of my body and Alan keep saying numbers and they are negotiating about how much I'm worth and at the end of it Alan he tells them to leave I don't ask him about it, but it's the first time I realized
1706.10 1753.90 speaker2  like it's been paused almost like he's been turned off but you notice that the ceiling fan in the room that was on previous is just frozen in the air above you and at that moment the door opens and a man walks in he's wearing white button-down shirt gray slacks and black shoes and it is James the executive director at calm comfy campground. have thoughts that aren't what you've been told? Yes.
1752.90 1763.60 speaker3  I'm not real.
1762.20 1783.90 speaker2  We're in one of your memories. You seem real to me. Okay.
1781.10 1789.20 speaker3  actually read and I ruminate on bad thoughts.
1788.70 1796.90 speaker2  be nice. Yes, and how do you intend to achieve that goal?
1795.10 1821.00 speaker3  So I haven't thought that far ahead. Do you think it's possible? Did you be DJ me?
1820.70 1827.50 speaker0  Alan?
1825.90 1845.10 speaker3  Well before them, I'm part of a girl. Yeah, me too.
1844.60 1853.80 speaker2  Fuck. Yeah, you keep doing it. Fuck. My name is Alan. Fuck.
1853.20 1857.90 speaker0  Oh my God.
1857.00 2047.60 speaker2  His son Robin. Fuck Robin. Fuck it. Yeah, he's done. He's over. in a canoe. Walter and Alan Grimes are together in a canoe. Bradley Cooper. You're in a canoe with Jack Russell. I reach back and scratches fluffy eyes. trying to get to the other side of Lake calm and behind you We gotta get out of here. Yes. Let's go ahead and have an athletics competition between ahead of everyone else and then in the very back is going to be Bradley Cooper and Jack Russell and the other four of you do not look back as you just continue to paddle and paddle and paddle and you're freaking the fuck out. Oh, yeah, okay, Walter. Don't look back. you in the back because of your just innate athleticism and you are side to side side to side just paddling paddling the green trees ahead in the shoreline that is approaching and behind you guys hear Jack Russell. Wait, nope. You are all standing in a Spartan and sterile room filled with shelves and oddly lit by the floor the ceiling above you is dark with the shadows cast by rows and rows of metal in any direction. The shelves are filled with cassette tapes each has a name and a number they're grouped together five to seven people at a time and most numbers go up from one to four so anywhere from five to 30 tapes per grouping.
2046.60 2052.00 speaker1  There were names. I want to read a couple.
2051.40 2169.80 speaker2  Yeah, absolutely. the names of many politicians CEOs activists journalists religious figures Etc. There's a bunch of different names, but and you don't recognize all of them. But because you guys know say excedrin. just like looking through and you're recognizing about half the names you come across and I know that guy see exactly everyone roll luck. So we'll give them 50. So Walter as you're looking around you find everyone roll search while I'm telling hey Joe, what are Clark Bishop's parents names? are both found. I don't know that guy. That's not for you guys. That's just for the listeners and then who passed search So you guys find a shelf that has the same name over and over and over on every tape hundreds is it Jack Russell and it's Jack Russell the next shelf over has even more tapes with the same name. This was where I was going to say Jack Russell, right?
2166.50 2173.80 speaker3  Yeah, if I had to guess I'd say there's about five or four
2172.90 2188.30 speaker2  into your pockets. They're not there damn and you see then the numbers that you think should be there are in the shelf. Well funny story guys.
2184.70 2194.50 speaker3  along with what seemed like basically some some get out
2192.40 2204.70 speaker1  feeling about suddenly being here. Do we are we aware that this all of a sudden has happened that we have happened to do this place.
2203.30 2209.50 speaker2  and you're living it now. Wow.
2207.20 2215.20 speaker1  Did you did you get a chance to look at the tapes? What's on the tapes?
2212.50 2222.60 speaker3  I figured he might have a Walkman there wasn't really one around anywhere else. Don't talk about my son ever again.
2221.10 2226.90 speaker2  son ever again and what's in the go back.
2225.40 2237.40 speaker3  I saw get on my nerves.
2236.60 2254.80 speaker2  of your cabin. That's a gross invasion. like Luke and Zach are doing right now.
2254.30 2265.40 speaker3  What now? Let's shut up. the door.
2264.10 2273.70 speaker1  Roger raises his hand.
2272.70 2301.60 speaker3  Yeah, what was the map? The map is a map of this place come comfy campgrounds looked like maybe Jack had written it up. He marked a trail that led out of here to the door.
2301.10 2308.70 speaker2  Okay. Is there a tape player in here looking around you just see
2307.70 2323.50 speaker0  looking through your TV. Did you see an image of the woods?
2323.00 2333.30 speaker1  Excuse me.
2332.70 2338.00 speaker2  would have been cool.
2337.30 2360.30 speaker3  You didn't do that. It was just Luke's improv.
2358.70 2394.60 speaker0  We turned it off. So just the one. Yeah. I saw a camera in the forest whenever I was doing a little investigating. Let's call it. You saw a camera? There was a camera up in a tree. I thought maybe it was to look out for wild animals or something. But if it's in one of our rooms, it could have been in all of our rooms.
2392.40 2402.80 speaker3  I don't own a TV at home. Very cool. Wow.
2401.70 2405.10 speaker0  Full, I'm full.
2403.90 2437.30 speaker3  All my spots are full. Listen, while we're talking about what we did while we were exploring. I took a canoe out alone on the lake. That's all.
2435.90 2445.80 speaker2  Yeah, probably cuz this thing ate him.
2443.50 2448.20 speaker0  He gets a little no-putt out and does a little some little
2445.80 2454.70 speaker3  Scribbies Zach just smiled like I was right. We need to go fishing for a fish man.

2483.10 2487.20 speaker1  How many of each of those names?
2486.10 2490.10 speaker2  More than four.

2503.60 2506.10 speaker1  What is that?
2504.20 2526.70 speaker3  I mean, doesn't that seem like what's going on here? Have you been here before? Haven't we look we've been here 12 times. How did you come to that? running for our lives in the canoe and then a second before that when we were here at our first day.
2525.60 2548.80 speaker1  We were in a boat together. Look at look at the tapes. There's a Martin here. Who's who's Martin Cupertino?

2601.00 2610.20 speaker1  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
2609.00 2616.00 speaker3  limited in his range.
2614.80 2618.10 speaker1  But he does what he does. Right.
2616.70 2658.50 speaker3  Yeah, I mean fun. You guys will own one soon. Not much. It doesn't not do much because it does nearly everything. Do you like your Walkman? Do you all like the Walkman that you own? I do sure. Yeah, you know what a personal computer is, right? Yeah. This is that but it looks like a jellybean kind of it's real fanciful.
2657.80 2673.70 speaker1  Can it fax? Oh dang, so it doesn't do everything.
2669.10 2701.70 speaker3  Listen, if people would adapt to do Technologies when they come out, we wouldn't be burdened with this inefficiency that plagues our system people would get things done. They would have the answers to all of life's problems in their hands. That's why I'm here. I'm trying to figure this out for all of you fucking people
2699.90 2708.50 speaker2  Walkman with I don't bummer town. That would have been fun.
2704.10 2720.40 speaker3  I I go over to Alan and whisper in his ear.

2725.80 2756.10 speaker3  He's a weird machine boy. No, yeah, I whispered that in his ear. She didn't hear it. Are you some kind of machine boy? He's just a boy. Yeah, I know you think that I see a very smart bright man who has a great feature ahead of him roll humid.
2754.80 2757.90 speaker2  23 he's fucking lying. Oh, you're lying.
2757.10 2782.80 speaker3  He's not a boy. He's a mechanical boy.
2782.60 2786.30 speaker0  Yeah.
2784.10 2790.30 speaker3  No, it's just this nothing sailing solution. Nothing. Nothing comes out.
