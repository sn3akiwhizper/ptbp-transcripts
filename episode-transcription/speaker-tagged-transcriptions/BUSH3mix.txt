196.48 273.04 speaker1  But if hyperbolic headlines aren't your thing, don't worry. It's time for the news. Doreen Maureen, the iPad scrolling Pinterest lady However, when Dr. Ann Falsom and her team entered the headquarters of Bigfoot underground, search and hunt, the air was sucked out of the room.
268.48 276.40 speaker0  that this dead boy on the table was somehow Michael Lambert,
273.04 296.24 speaker1  Carl's brother who weren't missing over 30 years ago. But that's family for you, always complex, emotional and time-bending.
291.68 341.12 speaker0  It's Molly Healy with Circles.
340.00 346.80 speaker2  I don't want to assume. How old are you guys? Almost 30.
345.52 351.20 speaker1  And then Allie's 19.
350.40 368.80 speaker2  I'm the baby. So, uh, because I was like, if you're over 30, I'm like, oh man, what a, so many years you, you lost out on pussy.
365.60 372.80 speaker3  How much pussy would you have gotten in homeschool?
372.00 379.36 speaker2  They're all gay. Amazing.
377.52 450.72 speaker3  I think Allie's pussy game's strong. It sounded better coming out of her mouth than mine. So I'd like to dive into each of your minds for a quick moment. As you've lost either one sanity for three of you or five sanity for the Chuckster. As you are looking at this, uh, I assume that the, the flood of chemicals to your brain that is just shutting you down right now is enough to make it hard to, uh, to assess the situation. But I just want to know what's going on in that, in that little fucking pea brain.
442.88 488.16 speaker2  I think, uh, the Chuckster has always had the ability to like, I don't know, think everything's chill. Everything's fine. Like even when bad things happen, like getting kicked out of basic training, he's just like, it's cool, crack a brew and move on with my life and it's all good and everything's happy. But this is the first time where he's like faced with his own mortality, that something bad could actually happen to him. And he does have a very close relationship with his parents, but he has been lying to them because he wants them to be proud of his accomplishments. And he's feeling this, I might not measure up and this might be the end and maybe I need to take things more seriously.
486.80 499.92 speaker3  That's like really internal. I was just like, yo, what happened to the Bigfoot? And you're like, I have to change my life.
498.32 598.64 speaker2  I think that's what he's thinking about. Because maybe they have vegetables. Yeah, that's true. like, because she's seen so many, so many dead bodies in her life. And also, you know, you know, people coming in from accidents and gnarly shit like that. Uh, so I think that's why she didn't lose all of her sanity, like Chuck Steere. Coming from when she had that scene with her daughter, it's always rough to see a child. It pulls at her heart string a little bit more so. And also in this way, uh, but also knowing what's going on in the world, having a sense of the unnatural and the weird occult thinking it's coming for children. I think she's only been exposed so far to adults having gone through these terrible things. And so now, uh, faced with a child, it's unsettling to her. But I think she taps into her professionality immediately and will try to assess the situation. Notice that Carl is reacting the way he's reacting, so he did not know. Um, and she will, yeah, she will slowly try to approach the corpse and make a medical assessment of it. Yeah, totally.
594.56 625.60 speaker4  between feeling like completely sick because it's a child and she's been haunted by these little metal melting children. But at the same time, there's like a weird wrong comfort because she is like an agent I know. But I think that's part of the reason why she lost less sanity.
625.44 628.16 speaker3  Yeah.
625.60 639.04 speaker4  She's like good at compartmentalizing. Yeah. So does she like spring to action type of person or? She'd probably be the first one to move forward. Yeah.
636.40 660.88 speaker3  What would even like, what is her move? Check this out. I know that you're not an FBI agent. than we do, it's role playing. But you know, what would be Doreen's next move? There's a body.
659.44 676.00 speaker4  Nobody touch it. Trying to find evidence. Rusty over here should take this moment to like analyze the body. Maybe me too. Sure.
669.52 696.72 speaker3  And, and Dr. Miller, of course, surgeon, you guys have like a good team for, for analyzing the situation for sure. I think it's interesting because Doreen, I would imagine is normally trying to figure out who killed the body. Right.
693.12 705.76 speaker4  morphed from something else or like, did something put this here? Yeah.
704.24 722.24 speaker2  Like she's interested now. So she hasn't really been giving a shit.
720.24 736.08 speaker3  I was very annoyed by my fellow agents. Didn't really give a shit. But now that there's a dead body, I'm pretty stoked.
733.28 764.96 speaker2  because she was so far removed from everything else. So everyone else had a more like personal hands-on experience. So now that she's seeing this body, she's like kind of finally like taking it seriously and is actually like interested and she needs to be interested in something to do her job well.
761.44 820.32 speaker3  in the back of your brain is saying, where's the evidence? How do we destroy it and make sure this doesn't get out? And finally, there is a certain amount of evidence that lives inside the brains of witnesses, right? So you do know that Jerome Dyer is another Delta green agent. It's fine if he knows, but there are two civilians in this room right now, Carl Lambert, almost 30 years ago, but who is still a 12 year old corpse on this table right now. And then you have Janice Ruth, who is also in this room. So I'm going to cut to her real quick as she is going to make a beeline for the front door.
819.68 821.04 speaker4  Oh yeah. Okay.
820.72 824.64 speaker2  Yeah.
821.52 844.96 speaker3  Ellie, you said Dr. Miller was going to be really interested in going up to the body, but as soon as Janice Ruth starts making a move, you reacted immediately. So let's go to you. Do you step into her way or?
839.04 874.96 speaker2  have that sort of role in her behavior because she's unbelievably clumsy and but I would try to motion for her if I can, like I can roll for it. I mean, who knows? I don't know. Alertness. Would that be a thing or? Yeah.
867.84 876.48 speaker3  If you could all roll alertness and actually Lindsey is Doreen's alertness or search higher.
875.84 884.80 speaker2  Okay, great. I got a little roll. I got a 12. Oh, nice.
882.56 896.88 speaker4  My alertness is higher than my search. I haven't rolled yet.
896.56 909.04 speaker1  Okay.
905.92 914.80 speaker3  she goes out or are you going to immediately check out the body?
914.08 960.24 speaker2  cool right now. She's cool headed, level headed. So she knows exactly what's going on. Her perception is on point. So she just straight up goes to, uh, she catches Ruth by the arm. Oh, there's no need. No, are you kidding me? Panic? This happens a lot. And she is going to lie and she's going to try to convince Ruth that she is hallucinating. She's been hallucinating, uh, had some sort of head trauma. She's going to try to do like a medical, do the power of suggestion of like, how have
959.84 964.80 speaker3  Yes. Oh, awesome. Go ahead and roll psychotherapy.
963.20 984.08 speaker2  Uh, not super high. Where's my psychotherapy? Where the fuck is my fucking psychotherapy? Uh, no, um, I have nevermind. Uh, no, I failed.
983.12 988.00 speaker3  I know what it is. No.
987.12 1005.28 speaker2  Calm down. Calm down. I just, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. Um, I'm going to, yeah. She's going to need to be restrained. Yeah. All right. So, uh, can I punch her in the face? Jesus.
1004.08 1012.16 speaker4  I probably have. Yeah.
1010.40 1015.52 speaker3  want to, want to move in to help.
1012.48 1026.80 speaker4  I think I probably have things to help restrain. Medical doctor, do you have an inhaler in your bag?
1026.32 1032.48 speaker2  Always.
1030.96 1039.68 speaker3  Everyone's very well prepared. You wouldn't be in Delta Green if you weren't. Oh, what's this?
1039.20 1058.16 speaker2  Okay.
1056.72 1206.40 speaker3  She's in the background. Uh, Dr. Miller pulls out an inhaler, helps Janice Ruth with. Agent Dyer is, uh, is comforting. Carl Lambert, who is now on his knees, kind of crawled up toward the pool table. He's got his elbows on the pool table and his hands flat. Chin is on his hands and he's just crying and staring at the face. And there's just slug hole after slug hole with blood just pouring out and pooling on this tarp below. And Jerome Dyer is just comforting Carl as best he can as Carl is just weeping and moaning. bathroom. There's not like a door to the bathroom. There's just a stall door with a toilet in the stall with a sink next to it. That's all still open in this room. There's a skee-ball table right next to our skee-ball, you know, uh, not table machine, And, um, uh, and then, you know, uh, in the middle of the room is this pool table with the tarp on it where this boy's body is laying lifeless in the corner of the room. Bigfoot hunting and for YouTube video making the two most important things in life. And you also would notice that, uh, there's some like work desks and stuff where they've got their, uh, computer set up. Jerome Dyer's looking back at one of the computers and he pulls out his phone and looks at the time and, and then, and that doesn't matter. I was just, I just kept talking for some reason.
1201.12 1213.70 speaker2  Pretend name is right now and be like, we should try to look at the body, but we need to calm these two assholes down first. Um, but she doesn't say that she tries to do it with her eyebrows.
1213.20 1221.92 speaker4  Exactly.
1221.60 1228.64 speaker3  Okay.
1221.92 1240.24 speaker2  So I see Dr. Miller looking at me and I just kind of sneak out the back while you two are holding her down.
1239.44 1243.36 speaker1  What's happening?
1242.40 1249.44 speaker4  Let me just go get it. It'll calm you down. It calms me down every night. Oh no, no, I need you.
1248.88 1251.60 speaker1  All right. Okay.
1250.56 1270.18 speaker4  What do we do? I pull out my personal cell phone and I pull up Pinterest. Okay. Just look at the pretty pictures.
1266.98 1281.14 speaker3  the chimpanzee, like pictures of other chimpanzees. And they're like telling you like, oh, nice. Okay. You can swipe to the next one. I love that video, but this is Janice Ruth's version. She's like, that's nice.
1280.58 1283.48 speaker1  Oh, thank you.
1282.98 1295.22 speaker3  Oh God. What is, is it like interior design porn?
1290.02 1313.62 speaker4  I'm showing her like TikTok cooking videos and then like, and then interior design. everything's made of felt. She's like, how did they make a spatula so small?
1312.18 1325.46 speaker2  Can I come back in with the shit? But I need to approach Dr.
1323.94 1366.28 speaker3  That is a critical success. You can fucking kill her. You can, uh, and because we made so many jokes about potions, uh, you can give this if, I mean, if they'll take it right. You have a liquid that is going to be clear. It is going to be unscented. It will have no taste and you cannot see it and they will only wake up when you, um,
1365.78 1391.30 speaker1  Yeah.
1385.94 1412.66 speaker4  No, but it's as tiny as the tiny cooking videos, so she's intrigued. Yeah. She actually really likes it. All right.
1408.18 1476.98 speaker2  All right, listen, I've got something and I'm talking low so I can use my, my normal voice. I'm not in character right now. I've got something that'll knock these fuckers out, but as soon as I give it to him, we're not going to be able to ask him a damn thing. So do I need to wait a second? What do I do? That's a good point. Like it, it seems like, um, our friend here has been able to calm her down somewhat. Let's try to talk to them before. And if they become aggravated again, let's use your little cauldron. Banana. But banana, got it. You say banana, those fuckers knocked out immediately. Exactly. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Good thinking there. Where do you hide it?
1474.90 1506.50 speaker4  Labeled tiny cauldron. And then that's him just being normal.
1500.42 1606.02 speaker3  Currently we have Doreen Marine is showing Pinterest videos to Janice Ruth and keeping her calm in the corner. I'm picturing her in the corner, like up against the bathroom stall door. It's literally the exact same shot of Doreen, like over someone and like a bathroom stall. But this time she's helping as opposed to slamming a teenager into the toilet. Dr. Rusty Hooch is carefully placing a tiny cauldron into the corner for safekeeping. And, um, Dr. Olivia Miller is heading straight to the body to give it a thorough look over as the Chuckster comes out of the situation and also sees Carl Lambert staring at the body with agent Jerome Dyer kind of stroking his, um, lack of hair. 55. the time. Wait, it is. Okay. So it's, uh, one is a create zero. One is the critical success. Um, and then 100 is a critical fail. So if you've got, that's 11 chances to critical out of a hundred. So there's an 11% chance, but I feel like it's happening more than 11% of the time.
1605.70 1616.42 speaker4  Okay.
1613.46 1620.44 speaker3  off your headphones and get the fuck out of the living room. So you can't hear me talk to Ellie right now.
1619.94 1627.38 speaker2  What? This is a game mechanic in the game. That's so funny.
1624.02 1654.90 speaker3  So Ellie, I like to run closed games. So, uh, you know, obviously with all the introduction stuff, I think it's fun to let everyone in on like the character full, like character idea of each person, even though you meet as strangers and you wouldn't know all that information beforehand. But once we get into the shit and someone learns a piece of valuable information that the others wouldn't know, I think it's fun to just give that piece of information to the person playing the character who knows it.
1654.26 1660.42 speaker2  Interesting. All right. So I can make a decision later whether I share it or not.
1659.38 1675.70 speaker4  Yeah.
1669.06 1777.78 speaker3  Olivia Miller checks out this body underneath all this bruising, all this black and blue and purple bruising up near the chest of this boy, there seems to be a rash and it's in the form of a circle. You see the biggest circle first, and it probably goes over the shoulder, under the arm a little bit around the pectoral muscle, over the clavicle, and then back around forming an enormous circle to, uh, you know, swear an oath. And then you notice a smaller circle just inside that bigger one. And these are just these red rashes and they're thick lines as they get closer to the center. And you see, it's like a bullseye. It's like a target. And in the very middle, you begin to look really closely. You've got your gloves on, you're all suited up. So you're able to kind of move the skin around and the skin is so wrinkly, like it's been stretched out and now it's kind of sunken back in. I'm going to get that real quick. It's my good friend Joe's birthday, uh, in three days. And that was his birthday present in the mail. Yay. Back into the most intense thing we've done.
1777.22 1801.54 speaker2  He's big. Okay.
1794.98 1803.38 speaker3  uh, from a high place, then it would make a round spot in the grass.
1802.82 1810.50 speaker2  Yes.
1803.38 1885.70 speaker3  Like a very, very small crater, just a, um, concave skin spot. But because it's so wrinkly, it's almost like, um, it's almost like if you had an uninflated balloon that you've taken scissors to just like an edge part of. So there's just a little hole, like a little circle hole there in the skin. And because you critically succeeded out of the corner of your eye, as you're pinching Crawling on the ground of the dirty tile floor and this weird impromptu cabin barn thing. And it looks to your eyes like a tick. You've never seen a tick like this. It has so many legs all around to where as it's moving, it just kind of looks like it's floating right above the ground.
1883.14 1889.06 speaker2  31 on to my current 55. Okay.
1886.74 1901.06 speaker3  You're not going to lose any sanity. You know, from your medical training and experience that a bull's eye rash is actually a common occurrence in tick bites. Tick bites.
1900.74 1951.40 speaker2  Yeah. I've actually had a fair amount of ticks. They're common in Sweden. Yeah. So, you know, it's always a bad sign when you get like, because you can get that several weeks after they've stung you and then you have to. Yeah. All right. reveal the body and everyone's reaction is that it's somehow this boy is Bigfoot, right? But he's morphing back like a werewolf or something. That's my thing. Right. Yeah. But, you know, much more awful way, but I didn't account for the tick. So now I'm a little, I'm a little interested and curious, but I don't know. So do I have to tell them or is it up to me?
1947.00 1981.40 speaker3  You can just describe your actions however you would like, but I'm going to have basically this will be your moment is your moment of knowledge is going to be your turn here. And then as we, as we bring everyone back in, I'm actually going to move into combat
1981.08 1991.96 speaker2  Thank you. Thank you. Great. So much fun.
1987.80 2003.72 speaker3  I would like to know what your dexterity are because we're going to move from whoever has the highest dexterity down to whoever has the lowest dexterity. Cause I'll know the difference.
2003.16 2008.68 speaker2  12. Oh shit.
2008.12 2019.32 speaker3  Okay. So let's start with Ali and Taylor.
2018.36 2021.48 speaker2  Do you do shoot?
2020.60 2022.92 speaker3  Rock, paper, shoot.
2021.96 2036.68 speaker4  Rock, paper, shoot. All right.
2035.64 2043.48 speaker3  Rock, paper, scissors. Open your eyes.
2042.92 2049.48 speaker2  All right.
2045.64 2055.64 speaker3  Rusty Hooch, then Chuck the Chuckster, then.
2053.56 2071.40 speaker4  I'm, I'm trying to be more serious. So I'm like, call me, call me Charles. Now
2069.88 2078.60 speaker3  You're like, you get this together. Chuckster. No, get this together.
2078.04 2080.36 speaker4  Amazing.
2080.36 2091.56 speaker2 
2089.72 2098.44 speaker3  Then we're going to do Dr. Rusty Hooch, Charles, Charles, Charles.
2097.16 2100.36 speaker4  You can call me Charles T's.
2098.44 2116.52 speaker3  I'll call you just Charles. Then, uh, then it will be Carl. And then we'll have Doreen and Miller. And then I don't know. I'm just saying this out loud. I'm going to cut it from the show.
2113.72 2119.64 speaker4  And I like poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.
2117.88 2170.20 speaker3  Janice Ruth is going to be last. So as far as you guys know, everything is the exact same. When you look over, you can notice that Dr. Miller is, uh, is pinching at the skin on the chest of this corpse. She is wearing like a full hazmat suit and gloves at this point, as are all four of you. Hooch kick this thing off. As you also would see, Dr. Miller is now releasing the skin and begins looking for, uh, something in her pockets or bag that she has with her. And it's Dr. Hooch's turn. Dr.
2168.76 2173.64 speaker2  Aren't you a scientist?
2172.20 2177.56 speaker4  Oh, that's right.
2176.92 2182.52 speaker3  I forgot.
2181.32 2198.36 speaker2  doctor in the situation. So I run over to Dr.
2197.32 2205.32 speaker4  Don't no one touch. Move aside, move aside.
2204.04 2209.88 speaker3  It is now Charles's turn.
2207.48 2218.20 speaker4  Is everything as I saw it last? Yep. Okay.
2215.08 2234.92 speaker3  Delta Green is sometimes you don't know why or why. Cause a lot of times we'd be in moving in dexterity order when you're in combat and then like a gunfight or a chase. So this could be either one of those, but it also could just be me being like,
2233.56 2240.44 speaker1  intention of the situation.
2235.16 2249.72 speaker4  I think that I'm going to use my two months of basic training knowledge. I'm going to, I'm going to barrel roll over to the door and secure it. I'm going to secure the place so that no one can escape.
2247.80 2312.68 speaker3  Ocular pat down of the entire place. You are at the only doors, the entrance and the exit. Excellent move. Jerome Dyer is still very much calming down Carl. As Carl begins, let's see, actually, I'm going to go ahead and roll for Carl's sanity here. And if anyone were to notice you, you, you're hearing Carl's sobs become more just like, what the fuck? And Janice Ruth is, I'm just okay. I'm just going to be okay. And so I'm going to lose my mind again a little bit. And she looks up at Doreen. She says, I'm fine now. And she's going to try to stand up and, uh, and move toward the door that both. Now Doreen is kind of in the way of, as well as Charles.
2312.36 2337.56 speaker4  Yeah. I think for Doreen specifically, she's just really ready to help with the body, I guess for this turn, I'm going to try and convince Janice to not leave the premises.
2332.84 2349.16 speaker3  If you want to roll persuade or psychotherapy, which everyone's higher.
2346.76 2359.16 speaker4  Damn, not lucky with the rolls. At least it's not a crit fail.
2352.60 2376.68 speaker3  Janice Ruth stands up and is going to move past you. Now only has Charles between herself and the door. Dr. Miller, it is your turn.
2372.04 2386.68 speaker2  to roll a persuade for this and she's going to say, if you leave, I have reasons to believe that we're all going to die.
2379.96 2406.76 speaker3  Uh, it's also weird and crazy, so I'm not going to get, I was, I was like, she deserves a plus 20 on that until I thought about Janice Ruth in that situation, which is like, what the fuck are you talking about, dude?
2406.12 2436.68 speaker2  Excellent. Excellent. It's a warning and it goes for all of you. And she looks at the Carl who's crying and, um, and everyone in the room is just like, nobody leaves. I have reason to believe that there's something really wrong going on here.
2433.00 2446.44 speaker3  dirt spread around it, but you don't see anything else anymore. Cause you've taken your eyes off the ground and, uh, we're going to head back to the top of the order with Jerome.
2445.40 2448.12 speaker4  It's going to be okay. All right.
2447.56 2481.16 speaker3  Stay with me. And, uh, Charles, what are you doing? Sorry. Just to give you a quick rundown, Janice turned her back to you when she turned to talk to Dr. Miller. When she put her hand behind her back, you see that she's reaching for a gun that is in her like waistband. You can grab her hand, you can grab her wrist, you can grab her gun, you can punch your butt.
2480.68 2491.24 speaker4  Well, okay. I think I'll use my, I would like to talk and move at the same time and humans typically do that. You can definitely do that. Okay.
2489.40 2492.20 speaker3  You're like, what can I do?
2491.24 2497.48 speaker4  What can I do in this game? It's kind of two things at once. Yeah.
2494.52 2498.20 speaker3  Talking, talking is always like kind of a free action. Freebie.
2497.96 2521.56 speaker4  Yeah. I am using my athletics to reach for the gun. So she's turned around and I'm going to stick my leg between her legs and then wrap it around one and get her down to a kneeling position.
2519.24 2541.24 speaker3  Go ahead and roll athletics. is probably closer. That's lower though. Yeah. Go ahead and roll.
2540.60 2549.80 speaker2  I'm going to go.
2549.48 2567.72 speaker4  Whoa. All right. I turned to Jerome. You got to fill us in, bro. Like this shit's crazy.
2564.36 2589.40 speaker3  This was a goddamn Bigfoot five minutes ago. And you both just like whip pan turn to the other two. Did I skip Dr. Hooch's turn?
2587.56 2598.60 speaker4  I was like, I guess I go after Taylor.
2597.80 2599.96 speaker3  So it's your turn.
2599.56 2621.88 speaker2  Okay. I look directly at Doreen and then I glance over at the cauldron in the corner so that Anne Folsom.
2618.36 2652.52 speaker3  I, if you could hold, just everyone hold for a moment. It literally did full not responding white screen and then boom, back to fully in motion.
2651.72 2658.62 speaker2  Oh my God.
2658.12 2666.44 speaker1  No.
2659.88 2677.08 speaker2  That it was like, it was like a very cool finale, like all the revelations and it's Yeah, of course. Yep.
2676.84 2705.56 speaker3  Yeah. We recorded, we rerecorded our first episode because it was the first time we were ever All right.
2703.40 2707.90 speaker4  to let Doreen know that she needs to go grab that. Yes.
2707.40 2713.32 speaker3  Okay. Sorry, dude.
2712.76 2722.76 speaker4  Wait. No, 11 would be. Oh, what does it mean? It means you passed. Oh, okay.
2722.04 2723.96 speaker2  I pass.
2723.40 2824.44 speaker3  Thank you. Uh, okay. Instead of leaving, instead of leaving the room this time, Lindsay and Taylor, just take off your headphones. And then if you just like put your fingers in your ears and wiggle them a little bit, Dr. crawling directly towards the military boots that are planted firmly on the ground in between Doreen. I don't know why I'm describing her feet so weird. It's heading toward her boots. It's a small tick. I need you to roll sanity. Okay. It's just a bug. You're going to lose one sanity. You've seen ticks. Hooch. This thing basically is floating as a wild amount of legs, but also seemingly a changing amount of legs carries this thing as if it's floating just off the ground directly toward Doreen Marine. As you, as you, uh, point at her and then give her the eyes, you know, over to, over to the vial. Because you failed your sanity? And so the knowledge that you possess and making the move toward Marine of having her, which is handy that you're telling her to move.
2822.76 2831.40 speaker4  That does work out quite well for you.
2830.76 2842.44 speaker3  All right.
2839.72 2850.84 speaker2  It's fucking banana time.
2843.24 2868.20 speaker3  Uh, and with that, I need everyone else to roll sanity. So Charles, Doreen, Dr. Miller, go ahead and roll. Alertness.
2863.32 2875.24 speaker4  Because if it was sanity, I would have crit failed, but I crit success.
2874.84 2878.68 speaker3  Lindsay.
2875.80 2880.68 speaker4  51 on a 70.
2879.88 2883.80 speaker3  And Dr.
2883.56 2889.80 speaker2  Dr.
2883.80 2975.80 speaker3  Miller seems to be looking all around on the floor, trying to find something that she may have seen previously, but is now lost Doreen. You see it right in front of your boots on the ground, crawling toward you. And Charles, you also see this little, little creature. Sorry. Lindsay, take off your headphones again. As you just, oh wait, no, hold on. Sorry. Keep them on just for a moment. Listen to me. Listen to the words coming out of my mouth. You see just a tick. There's just a tick on the ground. It's normal. You're out in the woods. There's a tick. There's, you know, sometimes there's crickets. Sometimes there's ants. No, it's just like a normal tick. I mean, ticks are not great. You don't want it to be near your foot, I suppose, but that's all you see. You take off your headphones. No big deal. Hey, uh, Chuckster, this thing has so many goddamn legs. Uh, like this is not a tick. This is, it looks like a tick, but it's almost like floating off the ground with how many legs it has and the number of legs keeps changing. And like with the critical success on the alertness, you actually notice that it is almost like forming and reforming in different spots around like as it's moving toward Terrain's boot.
2974.76 2976.84 speaker4  I can picture that.
2975.96 2980.36 speaker3  Yeah, me too.
2979.40 2985.08 speaker4  Good storytelling.
2984.28 2987.00 speaker3  I love you. Love you too.
2985.80 2994.44 speaker4  Shut up.
2993.32 2999.48 speaker2  She gets to close her ears.
2997.80 3007.56 speaker4  Lindsay, they're saying bad things about you.
3006.60 3009.24 speaker2  Doreen, it's your turn. What do you do?
3008.04 3015.96 speaker4  I'm going for the cauldron. Hey Zach, do I have to lose sanity points?
3015.00 3032.04 speaker3  You did have homework. The rest of the class groans.
3030.44 3038.14 speaker4  Zero on.
3037.64 3053.40 speaker3  Hey guys.
3051.96 3058.76 speaker4  And Zach, what did you roll?
3057.72 3071.56 speaker3  You rolled a 100. So yeah, pretty easy. You move over to the cauldron in the corner. What do you do?
3066.52 3090.04 speaker4  Do I know that this cauldron is like a potion that you've made that will knock them out? So I grab it and I look at you.
3086.36 3096.44 speaker3  Lindsay and Ally, take off your headphones and plug your ears.
3095.64 3102.20 speaker4  What's up, bro? Should we pause like every five minutes to do this?
3101.08 3173.72 speaker3  Yeah, it's really fun. All right, should we get them back? You also notice it, you know how I described how it like kind of blips in and out? That's so weird. Let her act first if that's cool. We don't want to interrupt her. She seems to have something fun to do. I think she's excited about it. What do you think?
3172.60 3197.24 speaker4  All right, let's get it back. All right, come back. I'm so honored.
3195.96 3200.76 speaker3  No mention of Joe there. That's interesting.
3200.12 3212.52 speaker4  Joe's a saint.
3211.40 3221.16 speaker3  Doreen Marine, what do you do?
3219.64 3252.44 speaker4  I'm going to head towards Janice. And I think my plan is to just like try and like, as if she were my cat or my dog, just like pry her mouth open and give her some of this and like rubber throat to get her to swallow.
3251.16 3258.44 speaker3  That's amazing.
3254.28 3274.20 speaker4  And also like, and once I became Charles, everyone just was like, wow, there's just something about him. I just trust him. He pulled that move where he got the gun.
3272.84 3284.12 speaker2  Now recording.
3282.76 3293.64 speaker3  If you guys are cool with that.
3291.48 3297.88 speaker2  That was dick-sucking sound. Satisfying.
3297.48 3397.08 speaker3  All right.
3381.08 3401.08 speaker1  Falling fast into a deep abyss Till they chase you out again Falling fast into a deep abyss
