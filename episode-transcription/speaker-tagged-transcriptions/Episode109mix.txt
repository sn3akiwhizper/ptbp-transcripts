0.00 51.84 speaker0  Salutations, my little honeybees. It's your beekeeper, Beastie Wolf, the dog. I'm here to protect you at all costs while getting a little taste of that sweet, sticky honey every now and then. I can't wait to make some toilet wine with y'all's sweet syrup. I am buzzin' at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station located in a trash hive of my own making. What's that sound? Is it the mail truck? They're saying I got a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby. This fine edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Bee. Very nice.
48.54 61.84 speaker1  proving that even the busiest bees can take time to make this old Wolfie feel something again. They right.
59.04 137.14 speaker0  Have you felt its honey mustard contours dripping around the edges of that braised brain of yours, encased in a sun-toasted bread of skin and bone? The sponge monkey elders assure you those are olives, not eyes. And if you haven't seen the yellow sign, You're talking about toast, you're talking about mustard, and braising, and goddamn, I am fucking pumped for whatever the hell it is you are talking about. And if you're already wrist-deep in the interwebs, of Pretending to Be People. Share it on the mountain, share it over the hills, Jesus Christ wouldn't have been so him-damn-bored.
133.72 148.02 speaker1  If he had access to all this sweet content in the show notes, and if that ain't the truth,
144.10 228.36 speaker0  Last time, we lost a few dear friends. Please bow your heads and take a moment to reflect on the lives of Jimmy Sanders, Carmen the Possum, Harry Klinker, Rusty the Distinguished Gray Dog, Professor Horace Green, and the decapitated head of preacher-sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard. Damn, I miss all them. to fight alongside the Overseer against Rose Mary in this gigantopumpathy-pipicus. Taking us to the top of round one is Dragon in 3 with What Kind of World Are You Living In? ["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]
223.36 241.00 speaker2  ["What Kind of World Are You Living In?" by Dragon in 3 plays in the background.]
236.00 247.38 speaker0  My name is Nick Nichols and I am here with my brother, Nick. Wait.
245.32 282.68 speaker1  I'm Nick, you're Nick. We're all Nick for Nichols, and welcome. We are here in, oh my goodness, where the fuck are we, Nick? I don't seem to know, but it is terrifying me to my core. I am scared. Look at that big fucker on the left. And we've got, thankfully, bringing us home, giving us some shelter with it, I don't know, that hurts, is Planet Juggernaut.
278.44 290.64 speaker0  I'm really excited to start mixing it up again.
287.44 398.28 speaker1  but I think I can still be a scrapper. Hope I can put on a good show for you guys. Dick is dead. Nick and Nick Nichols here, and we are gonna go now to our correspondent. I see him, he's running a buck. He just came down in a full Technicolor flash of light over there. He is crying on the ground. It's Jeremiah Jones Johnson. Let's go with him now and see what's going on. What do you think about that, Nick? As before, I just always love to hear my boy Jeremiah say stuff. and I don't know where the fuck he is, but we're gonna try to find out now. who've just been seemingly teleported into this plane of existence, three individuals who have just made their way onto this plane, standing on the ground made of light. Hey, Brad, where are we? I gather it's the dark world. and hands it to you.
393.56 412.84 speaker2  My name is Patrick Star, and, wait, is that? Okay.
410.48 420.64 speaker1  Well, let's take it down to Jeremiah Jones Johnson for our new game. Is it the SpongeBob character or the porn guy?
418.12 440.26 speaker2  My name is Patrick Star, and I disagree. We're not in the dark place. This is clearly heaven, and that's God, and I, for one, and I'm gonna go rush up and meet him. He's running full armed, like, at the can't jump ropypicus.
435.26 480.38 speaker1  Okay, and Patrick Star runs directly toward one of the legs of this enormous, shadowy, dripping creature and disappears into it like a open door with only darkness on the other side of it, and he is no longer visible to the human eye or any other eyes. And this third person, who are you? Hey, you can just call me Jerry.
477.30 482.66 speaker2  and well, this ain't the city.
481.22 502.90 speaker1  Back to you, Mick and Nick. Oh, thank you so much there, Jeremiah Jones Johnson. Jones, because I called you Jones Johnson because you called yourself Johnson. Somebody else called you Johnson, so we're good with all of it. Thank you so much.
500.86 519.68 speaker2  Every time Jeremiah says things, I light up with a joy that just cannot be found in any other place in my life. What?
515.64 586.88 speaker1  This massive, lumbering, shadowy, dripping creature that we've been calling the Gigant Umbropithecus because someone in the circle of knowledge called it that, so large that it can hold onto the illuminated pipe that is hanging in the sky with its hand. Once trapped inside this eternal treadmill prison, it can now hold the entirety of its former... It rips and throws this toilet paper holder with light shining out through the middle of it, throws this thing behind it as its other hand It's gonna testify. It's up in this spot. Luke, how do you think it looks? Fuck. That's right, extra fly. Extra fly.
584.80 598.88 speaker2  It touches...
593.88 622.28 speaker1  which immediately breaks and waves begin to form an ocean of black ichor. It is moving like dark, lagoon-y waters. So gravity, seemingly, up there is opposite of the gravity that you're on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
620.24 669.84 speaker2  A dark sky sea of endless blackness. A dark-sized ski of endless darkness. That's right, yeah. Stark ski and hutch. Yeah, kids, if you wanna know how to be funny, just remember what sounds sound like other sounds. And blurt that out almost compulsively and you'll be just like your best friends, the boys at PDBP.
667.28 689.00 speaker1  She's coming straight for Planet Juggernaut. Two of her metal tendrils slam down into the illuminated ground below her and she flings herself toward this enormous, robust sphere, a larger version of what controls her. And the other two tendrils are going to try to penetrate the armor of Planet Juggernaut.
688.16 699.80 speaker2  A hundred.
697.44 711.20 speaker1  Mother fucking shit.
709.24 737.04 speaker2  Would they be in the big thing of... Much like Nick Cage, you don't have Mandy.
736.20 784.12 speaker1  like years ago. I'm pretty sure that's what I pulled it from. Hell yeah. Critical success. Nice. Hell yeah.
781.20 788.52 speaker2  10 and two for the first ones, 10 and two again for the second ones. Whoa.
787.20 826.68 speaker1  Damn. That's wild. 24 points of damage. God's here guys. taking over half of Rosemary's hit points. She was coming at him. with two metal tendrils shoved into the ground and the other two are in attack mode trying to stab into the planet juggernaut.
823.04 881.12 speaker2  planet juggernaut's eyes kind of swing around and lock onto Rosemary. and you see the tip of the tendrils that are like about to attack them just kind of slice clean off. And so he destroys like half of her body, he said. So it's exactly like a dope fucking samurai movie where you see the lasers seemingly go right through her middle, but nothing happens for a second. but you can still see like anger actively on her face, but it's more like annoyance as she begins to just climb out of this Rosemary like shell. Am I on planet juggernaut or am I on the ground?
879.80 945.32 speaker1  That Keith. and he is angrily yelling at you because he has just seemingly failed. His whole mission was getting to this phone and then he seems disappointed by the results. Hey man, what's your problem? Luke just did the thing that like inflatable men do in front of big car dealerships.
940.48 956.60 speaker0  Hey man, the phone, what is it? They didn't say anything to me. It's all, none of this means anything. Don't you, why don't you fucking understand?
953.56 965.48 speaker3  Give it to me, give it to me.
961.32 971.38 speaker0  and just drops you but he doesn't give you the phone
970.56 990.20 speaker3  I get up and go to the phone. I'm like blindly feeling around for it because I can't say anything. There it is, yeah.
987.16 1018.42 speaker1  So go ahead and roll on whether or not you can find this phone this turn. Just a 50-50. No, roll luck. and when you lift it to your ear, you hear.
1017.00 1025.96 speaker2  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1023.52 1031.08 speaker1  Roll intelligence.
1030.24 1043.40 speaker3  I fail. Shocker.
1041.18 1047.44 speaker2  What is Keith's intelligence? 50.
1045.08 1053.04 speaker3  Not bad, I got a 63 on a 50.
1049.88 1061.32 speaker1  what you recognize this sound from but you know that it sounds familiar.
1058.08 1070.40 speaker3  I'm gonna maybe just keep listening to it for a second and maybe in just a little bit I'll be able to,
1069.32 1080.98 speaker0  thinks he can use the phone. I'm the one who came down here to get the fucking phone but I'm not talking to anyone in particular.
1079.20 1092.52 speaker3  and I lay back down on the ground and keep listening to it.
1089.52 1102.62 speaker0  Just waiting for the internet company to get back to you.
1100.18 1127.48 speaker1  creatures appear out of nowhere in between the dark oozing ocean above you and the illuminated land below you. Above you and below you, what did I say? Between the, whatever. And,
1125.46 1138.68 speaker2  This nerd shit doesn't matter.
1136.68 1153.44 speaker3  which means one of us didn't listen to it.
1149.28 1316.76 speaker1  and the bright light shining up from below, in this air of nothingness in between, massive creatures with gaunt frames in black suits with translucent skin fall to the ground. And as they do, they are surrounding this luminous land liturgy that is worshiping the overseer. They look directly at this floating man, his arms out with his dark robes and his cowboy hat. And in unison, they all say, Please come with us. for the alternate version of yourself. Go ahead and roll for Clark Old. Just up and down, D100. His right arm is pulled to one side by one of them. His left hand is pulled to the side by another with their minds. His legs are held down by two of the others. You see he's fighting against it. But one of them is trying to get a hold of his head. His entire face becomes engulfed in light. And he beams this light at one of these gaunt alien creatures wearing black suit. It's translucent skin pops puss and ooze. Not green, not yellow, just this clear milky slime. Hits the ground in a pile of a black suit covered in... That's like fucking disgusting. he's got fingers on either side of just this Just comes out, I'm gonna throw up. And then he turns and looks at another one because he critically succeeded. And he does it to a second one, looks at a third one, does it to a third one. There's only two more left on the field.
1314.32 1324.88 speaker2  You ever DM so hard you make yourself throw up?
1320.72 1330.04 speaker1  Clark Old, they're not Clark Old, just Clark Bishop. It's your turn.
1327.88 1336.40 speaker2  the Clark we've all come to know and love.
1334.52 1356.56 speaker0  And he wants to do that. And so he's just gonna do like he did with Anne Love and try and imitate everything he just saw the overseer do. And he wants to try and make his face turn into bright light are they the ones that have his hands?
1355.64 1412.76 speaker1  Okay, gotcha, gotcha. They're holding him with that grip that one of them used on Keith Beans earlier in the show. And Marvin Glass used on Clark Bishop at one point in time where they can physically grab you from further away. I like Star Wars a lot. and that roll carries over to yours, which means that you succeed in being able to do this to one of them.
1410.48 1457.94 speaker0  and that he just tries to mimic that. He just tries to scrunch his face up a little bit, clear his mind as much as possible and just picture light. He just wants to picture light. He doesn't know a hundred percent if it's gonna work, but it kind of did that last time with the blood thing. And he thinks that maybe, I don't, and his head, just like a light bulb turning on illuminates and it kind of startles him even as there's now a bunch of light flooded the area around him. And he just directs it all as much as he can into one of them. goo erupts off the top of one of these things,
1454.32 1469.48 speaker2  with some pretty awful, pretty awful awful. and it's like really warm and he can feel it.
1467.84 1480.36 speaker1  Zach falls to his knees, begins throwing up on the ground and gets trampled by some of the other chanting people.
1476.80 1495.60 speaker2  Clark is also, he's like proud of himself
1491.08 1517.12 speaker1  that had come from Clark Old previously dissipates and he looks at you with this, that moment when a father realizes- TFW. Like Dallas, Fort Worth? The pride that all fathers have
1512.92 1525.04 speaker3  in the Dallas International Airport shines on his face. Dad's face when- No, he looks at you and it's- Oh!
1524.20 1533.44 speaker1  Yeah.
1531.04 1535.64 speaker2  oh yeah, it's the guy in the woods with the,
1534.80 1540.56 speaker1  is it Grizzly Adams? That's what I was thinking of too.
1539.72 1558.16 speaker2  It's not Grizzly Adams. Is it Jeremiah Johnson? Jeremiah Johnson- The nodding man? On the field reporting. No, it's not. What? Is it not?
1557.32 1570.32 speaker1  No, it's not. It is Jeremiah Johnson. Yeah. That is-
1568.20 1580.04 speaker2  This man is actually Robert Redford. Dude, it is Robert Redford. Wait, no, Robert Redford is Jeremiah Johnson, but that nodding man is not Robert Redford.
1579.20 1580.96 speaker0  That's what I was thinking.
1580.04 1588.38 speaker2  Oh. I don't think.
1586.30 1592.42 speaker0  of the 1972 film, Jeremiah Johnson.
1591.58 1595.94 speaker1  Weird.
1594.74 1608.54 speaker0  I love that there's a lot that just says this is- That just say Zach Galifianakis is this man, when it's clearly from the 70s.
1606.98 1611.30 speaker1  What is he holding in that gif?
1610.46 1614.22 speaker3  You know-
1612.74 1618.18 speaker1  There are shots of him in that movie where he doesn't look like he does in that gif.
1616.26 1631.78 speaker2  He's holding it to the side. Exactly. It's really fucking weird.
1630.70 1648.18 speaker1  Okay. He looks at you like Robert Redford and Jeremiah Johnson and just slowly gives you that slight smile and head nod.
1647.34 1657.70 speaker0  Oh yeah, dude. Or what's the building?
1654.78 1681.34 speaker1  New Sound Commotion from outside. on the new debut album, Hit Sound Commotion. New Sound Commotion. Hit Sound Commotion.
1680.50 1691.78 speaker0  Are you talking?
1690.62 1703.26 speaker3  Jesus Christ. Oh God.
1701.42 1712.98 speaker1  on the other end of the telephone. That's like, this noise comes from outside. You hear it.
1711.02 1725.30 speaker0  it'll like click in my head and I'll be like, maybe they're here to help and I'll sprint downstairs.
1722.22 1753.02 speaker2  by Planet Juggernaut, or is at least, you know. Caught off guard. of Mary body, Jon Ball, just in pure tiny silver form, whips at her as hard as he can, is gonna try to just knock her on her ass, basically, on her ball.
1750.06 1824.26 speaker1  All right, let's tangle some wires. What should we roll for this? Okay. The ball of Jon Lee Pettymore lunges at the ball that is pulling itself out of the top half of the body of Rose M-A-R-Y, Rosemary. The clean cut across the leather jacket and white t-shirt of Rosemary is dripping with blood and you see as if sheet metal has been completely sliced clean. It's like a layer of t-shirt that is red, stained with blood, and then there's skin, and then there's this metal, and then there's more skin, and then there's reinforced metal, and then inside you just see these lengthy intestines spill out onto the illuminated land below.
1822.46 1832.42 speaker2  and then it's a walking eye situation but with an angry Rosemary torso just dripping its intestines all over the place?
1829.14 1864.26 speaker1  There aren't a lot of moments in this show that make me as happy as the one that you've just suggested now. Thomas, 10 luck. Nice. And as you come at her, she kind of, into the bottom half of Rosemary and your ball disappears up into the guts of Rosemary's body and you are stuck inside of this human goop.
1863.42 1880.14 speaker2  That's dope. Oh no.
1875.14 1904.34 speaker1  And now we're gonna go to our newly minted old characters. They haven't been around since episode 46. It is the scrap pit versions of Keith, Clark, and then John, who is inside Planet Juggernaut. So we'll start with Keith. It is Keith's turn.
1901.82 1918.94 speaker3  jumps right at Mary, and starts shooting his freezing liquid and is aiming his legs to just smash into her frozen head. Radical. Or roll.
1917.14 1931.86 speaker2  Stankling icicle guts.
1930.78 1994.46 speaker1  No, she doesn't. against John, which was a 75, which was also a pass. You freeze the whole bottom half of Rosemary and as you come down to try to take her on, essentially, to grab onto her frozen bottom half and hold it up like a ice cold shield that your fucking rad feet just boom and shatter and the bottom half of Rosemary just explodes into tiny little icicle pieces all over the ground.
1993.62 2009.02 speaker0  You do. So I'd like to shoot that sniper rifle
2007.02 2038.06 speaker1  The ball is actually visible currently, holding itself right above the top of her head. She's still in control of the top half of Rosemary through the spine with one tendril, but the ball itself is like she just got an idea. It is the light bulb right above her head.
2036.70 2056.94 speaker2  Damn. He just popped up and was, what the fuck? Poof.
2056.10 2128.98 speaker1  That's true. Oh yeah. When he reaches back with one hand to grab onto the sniper rifle, his hand just immediately hits the trigger and he doesn't even see it coming because the barrel is right behind his head. The frontal lobe of Clark Bishop flies out the front of his skull. And I mean, his cranium is now shattered into 40 different pieces that then spray out onto the ground. The people who are chanting below look up as this third version of this same person just, and the headless body of Clark Bishop just kind of falls off the side of Planet Juggernaut and hits the ground shoulders first with no head to stop the fall. Damn. then call that man a headless horse man. Oh my God, Nick Nichols. He was riding him and now he's not.
2127.06 2135.34 speaker0  I'm so proud of you, my brother. Remembering who I am,
2133.54 2146.18 speaker1  Moving on, it is. Planet Juggernaut's turn.
2145.08 2155.78 speaker0  Yeah, that's a bummer. Correct, yeah.
2152.66 2173.98 speaker2  from his tiny little Inspector Gadget helicopter blade, zooming full speed at Rosemary. extended forward like he's trying to full on superhero puncher when he gets there.
2172.50 2216.64 speaker1  39. It is still in the same round as her 75, which was a pass from earlier. So two tendrils grab into the luminous land below and backstroke and dodge nimbly out of the way as Planet Juggernaut hits the ground right next to Keith Bishop, who just landed, shattering the frozen bottom half. Clark Bishop. Did I just say Keith Bishop? Keith Bishop. had to be included in plot canon, then this story would be confusing.
2214.56 2248.22 speaker2  Well, we could have a really fun and incestuous filled like prologue where the Beans, the Bishops, and the Pennymores just all get together in like the 1920s. And we're all, there's just so many secret Beans babies littered around contention. Oh man, Beans babies.
2245.06 2305.64 speaker1  Keith Vigna was the person whose name I tried to say. And now it is the turn of John Lee Kevinmore, the third, who is face first on the ground, having just been brought here by Planet Juggernaut. Very confused by the situation that's at hand. He was just crushing Wheel of Fortune, not two seconds ago. He fires his gun into the air. of this other Wild, Wild, Wild Lake combat, Nick Nickles. throws a weird pipe made of light on the inside behind him and then touches the sky. Oh, he's gonna testify! And the sky above turns into an ocean of blackness.
2303.28 2313.00 speaker0  but I do think I would never return to be with you, my beloved brother.
2309.84 2354.96 speaker1  that he wants to interlock hands slowly. He jumped inside of her. Keith Beans, one of them jumped down, froze onto the bottom half, smashed that to bits. Planet Juggernaut jumped to the side of that. They're all diving all over the place. Clark Bishop exploded the back of his head. Oh my God, he just completely deheaded himself.
2352.64 2362.24 speaker3  There seems to be a lot going on in this combat,
2359.72 2366.80 speaker0  and in this new hell we find ourselves in.
2365.02 2429.76 speaker1  of seemingly this same man. He's dressed in a weird 1970s version of a contingent police officer uniform, and this version of Clark Bishop, oh, light came pouring out of his head to save an older looking version of himself from these large creatures, oh, who seem to resemble our former employer, who's now locked forever in some sort of weird icicle box into a lava volcano. Bobby Glass, they kind of look like him.
2428.60 2436.72 speaker2  We could do this other thing though.
2432.76 2529.52 speaker1  shadowy and dripping with ooze and pure darkness, reaches up and additionally begins to waggle its long phalanges into the murky water above you. It is slowly lowering down toward you all. And two, multiple unspeakable worm-like abominations erupt out of the surface of this black, icorous ocean. down toward you, still far away this round, but seemingly will be moving toward you with each further round played in this combat. They're tube-like, they're covered in squamous, black, partially translucent membranes. Their bodies are segmented, toxically green, pulsating arteries and veins can be seen through their thin looking exterior. They have no identifiable eyes or nose and their cavernous, circular mouths, one sitting just inside the others, are lined with hooked teeth. They spit out saliva that's somehow darker than black and from these maws, these sharp stylets protrude like something between a tongue and a noodle-like needle.
2528.12 2546.24 speaker2  when he shoots into the air?
2543.60 2598.92 speaker1  from this Wheel of Forch John. John Wheel Pettymore. Rosemary's turn. Rosemary plugs one of her metal tendrils into the ground next to her and then goes deeper and then goes deeper and out in a circle like a riplets from a drop of water into a puddle. Those are called riplets because they're small. These ripples are made of technicolor swirl that begin to form around and you see a new portal begin to form around one of these tentacles from Rosemary. Keith, you are on the phone.
2595.56 2619.84 speaker3  Maybe I should listen to it in a different type of way. I will finally understand something.
2614.84 2626.76 speaker1  Hello, Keith Ashley Beans, what can we do for you?
2625.12 2675.92 speaker3  Yeah, what can you do for me? Don, you want anything? I'm not in the room. Get an Oreo and a M&M. I couldn't tell because it's so dark in here. I put the phone back on the phone and just lay there.
2671.72 2704.44 speaker1  you've probably done just as much as anyone else has for the combat hands. is going to take on Clarkold once again in a struggle. Please roll for Clarkold, Joe Terry.
2702.96 2709.20 speaker0  I rolled a 75.
2707.56 2738.56 speaker1  Oh, Clarkold has 80. Big old success. Literally this thing reaches out at Clarkold and Clarkold looks at it and its hand fucking shrivels back to its elbow. Its forearm is completely missing so you can see the effect.
2736.20 2742.64 speaker0  because it seems like Clarkold's got it handled
2740.56 2757.36 speaker2  What do you want with us, him and me
2752.88 2772.28 speaker1  Warning, for your own safety, please stay here. If you choose to disobey this order and you return to plane 1620216, you will be eliminated.
2770.48 2788.72 speaker0  We're not your problem, that's your problem and I'm pointing at the giant creature. Ah, ah, ah.
2787.40 2794.00 speaker1  Oh, fuck yeah, dude.
2792.00 2800.44 speaker0  I didn't know that was gonna work like that.
2798.84 2819.08 speaker1  gigantic morpithecus. Its eyes get really big and it looks down at its shriveled hand and then looks down at its other hand but it already took its turn. So it's Don D. Pettymore.
2816.16 2838.48 speaker0  am I outside of the building observing what happened?
2837.24 2842.32 speaker1  Yeah, you do.
2840.72 2851.52 speaker2  Do you see one of those? It's not the same one you were talking to earlier. That one's a shiny metal ball in the sky.
2847.08 2868.84 speaker0  Yeah, now I'm like, John, John, John and I'm like yelling at John and running towards him because I'm curious if me calling the telephone brought John back to help us and I'm gonna run directly towards him. I'm assuming he's decently far away. I don't know if I have anything else to do, but.

And he just jumps as high as he can, trying to get sucked into the gravity So I wanna jump as high as I can and try to get sucked into the gravity of that plane and once I feel the kind of shift, I want to try to aim my body right into one of the mouths of the worms and just unload my freeze gun and bust my way out of there.
2999.20 3018.36 speaker2  Either way.

3042.24 3070.24 speaker1  it would be one of your turns, but okay, with this turn, like on the other side, like forward, and so his legs kind of go over where his head would be and then land on the ground, boots first.
