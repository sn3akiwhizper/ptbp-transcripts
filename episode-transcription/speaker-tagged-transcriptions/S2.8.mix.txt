45.92 125.24 speaker0  The bunnies that were once my pets now hold me within a liminal space. Doors folding in upon themselves. The eldritch forms of these furry fiends have been revealed to me. They keep me fed and clothed, but I am captive nonetheless. All because I wouldn't give them banana chips. I have slipped this message through a crack in the wall. I hope you find it. P.S. Please send banana chips. Enjoy your stay. I'm sure they won't be keeping you there for too long. Humans live what, a couple hundred years or so? Ah, you'll be fine. I will not be sending you banana chips because I do not believe in them. I will not conform and I shall not obey. tag at pretending pod on Instagram fuck Mark Zuckerberg

209.92 229.88 speaker1  to the standard rabbit to create the mythological beast.
227.28 243.00 speaker0  the oldest child of Fred Godell disguised as the production assistant. The medical staff at Grover's Gorge showed up in a bullpen car
241.00 253.64 speaker1  And on the way to the lab,
249.96 281.20 speaker0  who Stevie says went by Greg before, quickly grabbed the ribbon, popped it in his pocket and promptly fucked off back to his Godell innovation zone or jizz, if you'd like, and I do. In the lab, the medical staff says they can treat Beck's wound here in the same room
279.28 333.88 speaker1  called Sandro. Taking us now to this quirky and riveting news story.
332.56 382.88 speaker2  Where's the real tree sub? And I knew that the one about trees is called marijuana enthusiasts, but I didn't, there's some other ones that I didn't know. World politics is anime titties and anime titties is world politics. And John Cena is about potato salad and potato salad is about John Cena. Oh, also I knew this one, but Super Bowl is actually about superb owls. So I didn't know this one. There's an Amish subreddit. It has 175,000 members and no posts.
382.04 387.88 speaker1  Holy shit. Whoa, look out.
386.24 396.36 speaker2  Fell on a jackalope. Damn, I remember watching those videos for the first time when I was like probably in the sixth grade.
394.76 400.32 speaker1  I have no idea what you're referencing. Guy on a buffalo. Whoa, look out.
399.48 412.64 speaker2  I still have no idea what you're referencing. I guess I haven't seen Guy on a Buffalo. Cause I haven't seen any of those. The guy fucks a buffalo. Yeah. Like donkey man.
411.72 414.72 speaker3  Donkey man.
413.52 432.76 speaker2  We've already done this. Mr. Hands. We'll do it afterwards though, for sure. So yeah, we're talking to a turtle. We were, yeah.
431.52 438.08 speaker3  So what are we doing? So we're talking to a turtle? So we're talking to the turtle.
436.72 441.84 speaker2  Turns out, turtle.
441.00 494.64 speaker3  Sandro. Sandro the turtle. Sandro. Sandro. The makeup artist is kind of like laughing And then she kind of walks away and heads out the door. Exhales real big, looks you dead in the eyes. What do you mean kinda?
492.40 498.92 speaker2  Like two taps for yes, one for no. And one of the medical people kinda,
496.88 590.72 speaker3  we're gonna be right back with the equipment that we need to take care of this. Should only take a couple minutes. And they head out to the front door. Word, no hurry. And as they head out the door, you see a 58 year old man standing there. He's got bright blue eyes and a face lined by the sun, which is topped by a flat top of salt and pepper hair. He's Uncle Strong. Like he could bench 250 pounds, but he gets winded. Oh, that's not his name. I thought. but he also looks like he gets winded going up a flight of stairs. This is Chuck Bidwell. Hey, how's it going there? It's Chuck Bidwell. It's nice to meet each and every one of you. I'm the mayor. Well, I'm not the mayor. I'm kind of the mayor. Shout out to Anthony from Bristol, UK for Chuck Bidwell. Anthony is one of our $10 or up subscribers on Patreon. Thanks, Anthony. Or up. Yeah, Chuck Bidwell. It's a pleasure to meet each and every one of you. Oh, it looks like you've had a bit of a rough and tumble goal of it so far, Mr. Camerman, sir. As he looks at you, guess what happens? tucked in kind of over his belly. Hog?
589.60 599.96 speaker1  Yes.
594.96 609.04 speaker3  and you see into Chuck Bidwell's deepest, saddest soul
607.76 609.88 speaker1  Chuck Bidwell, yeah.
609.04 619.12 speaker3  What's your name? What's your name? Julius Summers. Julius, Mr. Summers. Nice to meet you. And you, sir?
617.20 631.68 speaker1  Beck Wilder, what happened to you, son?
629.48 708.52 speaker3  and he's like, he looks at the other two. Chuck Bidwell here. who has come to do all the wonderful interviews and show off Grover's Gorge for the beautiful town I'm not the mayor, I happened to lose. I lost the election there. Well, yeah, but he does get elected every time. How long has he been the mayor? I mean, I lost by 836 votes. What is the voting age here? Voting age is 18, like everyone else. We're in America, aren't we? Well, that's an interesting question. I mean, the only two votes I even got were from me and my wife, Barbara, kind of honestly, if I'm being completely honest, she pushed me into running. I'm being totally straight with you.
707.16 716.60 speaker2  Yes, you're not the mayor in title, and yet you have all the responsibilities of the mayor. Is that correct?
714.00 737.40 speaker3  them responsibilities is why I was so late. I'm so sorry that I didn't greet you at the gate. That is my deepest and searest apologies. I'm so sorry.
734.72 755.12 speaker2  That is very funny, I'm going to say that. It's all yours, Cal. Right. I've got my eye on it, it's not really going anywhere. Okay, we're all kind of bunched up
752.96 775.60 speaker3  in the same area then right up the front. The medical staff comes in and starts treating Beck while you guys are having this conversation. Hey there, whoa, precious cargo now. They have some sort of machinery that you haven't seen in a hospital before, and they begin attaching it to Beck's backside and upper thigh.
774.56 814.76 speaker2  But then I realized. whatever weird positions they put him in, he's holding the camera, trying to get footage of this new machine. You still have the camera? When he does that, Julius, yeah, grabs the camera, You feel some resistance. I got a 27, I pass. And you're at a negative 20, Cal.
811.92 841.68 speaker3  you actually notice that similarly to the way that the glass kind of rose from the grass below on the first floor, letting you through the entrance into this building, the glass on this room, the window, opens in a similar fashion. Chuck sees that you notice and you look down and see that he's got a little clicker in his hand. Oh, I thought it'd be nice that way there's no glass behind the shot. We get a beautiful, perfect view of the city park right behind.
840.36 852.78 speaker2  I thought you meant like he's clicking to see how many times I noticed things. I'm like, what the fuck, man? I was like, I'm taking that away from him. You're like, what's the count?
851.28 857.92 speaker3  I see.
855.44 867.84 speaker2  I wouldn't have even thought to ask. Yeah. Can you do it to, I mean, you don't need to, but can you do that to all the windows in this building?
864.36 926.40 speaker3  It's an absolutely incredible laboratory that we have here. It's beautiful. the window is the door, am I right? There's just kind of open doorways. It's almost like a heating pad, but on the inside of it, there is some sort of technology that you haven't seen before. It kind of looks like a light almost, but they can fold this piece of machinery around you. It's easily foldable around the back of your leg. And when it's on, you just kind of feel this sort of heat, a nice vibration, you get hard.
923.80 932.40 speaker2  Do you remember those old school machine things that would do this for weight loss?
931.56 934.38 speaker3  It was a band around.
932.40 954.04 speaker2  No, it was like a band that just went like, okay, it's wrapped around you. Like just putting his hand at the side and then waving them wildly. Anyway.
949.04 964.04 speaker1  Is this like some like new medical issue thing?
959.60 971.32 speaker3  and you basically don't have wounds anymore.
968.80 982.58 speaker1  and then looking at Cal and then looking at Julius and then looking down at the leg that is now healed.
981.30 1012.98 speaker3  but where they came back together, they're not completely healed. One of them goes, oh, it didn't actually, didn't work all the way, but that's okay. It should heal up naturally from here and you should be able to walk and they kind of hold your hand and lift you up out and you do, you feel much better as you gain back two hit points. You're only one away from full health and you can walk on this leg pretty easily now. to the gaudal technology here.
1011.38 1029.86 speaker2  Yeah, the turtle's dead or something, right? Oh no.
1025.78 1031.86 speaker3  Go ahead and roll alertness at a negative 40.
1029.86 1038.42 speaker2  The turtle's gonna fall out the window. Yeah, I've failed miserably.
1036.58 1088.38 speaker3  I mean, I have 40 alertness, so I'd- Oh yeah, ouchy, ouchy. The camera looks behind this group staring at this incredible technology as this turtle is swaying back and forth on its stool. I just wanna say right now, Teeter, totter, teeter, whoop, teeter totter turtle die. And you see the turtle going over the side along with the stool, boom, off the side of this building.
1086.54 1091.64 speaker1  The open window door thing.
1089.58 1119.62 speaker2  None of this is on us. From the quick glimpse we got, did it look like the turtle was doing that on purpose? Human, animal, turtle-ant? Turd-ant. Turd-ant.
1116.54 1124.80 speaker3  From your second tier in the lab.
1122.38 1172.84 speaker1  Oh no, holy shit, oh my God. Sandro, where's Sandro? Why do animals keep dying around me? Again. Wow, that would be great
1170.06 1179.44 speaker3  Beck, you know what, it's a critical fail, so you're gonna lose four grip, the full D4.
1177.12 1192.66 speaker2  What are you at and what's your breaking point? Nice. He's taking a lot of hits though.
1189.20 1197.48 speaker1  This is not a normal day for him.
1195.64 1201.40 speaker3  This is not a normal day.
1200.24 1221.92 speaker1  just looking at their faces, for whatever his reaction is, but just a normal medical staff,
1220.02 1225.16 speaker2  in front of an open fucking window.
1223.68 1236.32 speaker1  But I mean, are they like in tears like their great leader has died or are they just like, oh shit.
1231.64 1243.20 speaker3  and they are at a loss for what to do now. I need you all to roll grip. Failed.
1241.20 1255.04 speaker2  This might be why you said to do this, but Julius for sure was still had that clicker in mind
1252.72 1261.84 speaker1  97 baby with brand new dice, sir. Joe's rolling bad tonight.
1259.04 1361.44 speaker3  Thomas, go ahead and remove your headphones real quick. I need you both to roll a D8 and add one. Holy shit. Beck wild there. Julius Summers, you lose nine grip. where the turtle just teeter tottered to its doom and this wet energy flings itself into the body of Chuck Bidwell, on the far side of this room. And it is a glass wall and it shatters. Now, if you don't mind, if I could talk to you each one at a time, Luke first. This wet energy that you see just for a glimpse, you just catch enough of it to get some semblance of like what it looks like, what it moves like, how it reacts to things around it. Like very short split second as this thing flies past you. So I'm gonna let you ask three yes or no questions to kind of try to decipher what this thing is like.
1356.72 1365.52 speaker2  but did it have like a, not like human shape, but like what, there's a word I'm looking for here.
1364.68 1366.84 speaker3  Humanoid?
1365.52 1386.44 speaker2  Humanoid, sure. Like a buzzing sound or like what? It was weird.
1385.60 1388.44 speaker3  but it was not.
1386.44 1400.44 speaker2  But like not actual words or anything?
1395.44 1416.96 speaker1  Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw. Er-yem-hoth-floo-hah-maw-hah-maw.
1414.72 1425.56 speaker3  that's billowing from out of this thing, but almost distant with inside of it. Whoa.
1424.28 1433.00 speaker2  Okay, third question. What did it taste like?
1431.40 1487.88 speaker3  and that's fine, because this is more fun. And as it kind of went by you, you get this like just saltiness in your nose and on your tongue, like as it whips by you. Okay. This wet energy, you kind of get a glimpse of it as it just flies past you. And I think the first two have to be yes or no questions. And then the last one doesn't have to be a yes or no question based on what I did with Luke, in order to get an idea of like what it looks like, what it seems like, what it's doing, like how it moves, like anything you want to ask about what you might be able to perceive.
1484.68 1506.12 speaker1  My first question is, you said wet. Did it splash against Chuck Bidwell or did it get absorbed by Chuck Bidwell? No, wait. Yes or no questions. Sorry.
1504.64 1518.60 speaker3  Is a yes or no? yes or no question, so we can do this.
1516.96 1527.10 speaker1  was it just because I happened to be looking in the right direction? Or did it seem, I don't know how to ask this.
1526.20 1541.40 speaker3  You think that like, no matter what was going through your head, because you were looking in the right direction,
1539.96 1550.86 speaker1  How fast was it? or like somebody's shooting a super soaker out of the air.
1550.02 1565.86 speaker0  Good question.
1561.74 1589.14 speaker3  Thomas, that reaction comes from seeing all of a sudden, Chuck Bidwell has exploded through the far side wall on the opposite side from the open wall. He slams backward through glass, exploding everywhere, 10 meters from where he just stood a second ago when you saw him. You lose one grip as you have no idea how the fuck that just happened.
1585.90 1601.34 speaker2  No, it's pretty obviously that the ghost of the turtle that Charles Bidwell tried to assassinate or successfully assassinated, came back and like super scienced his ass through the window into like a last act of spiritual vengeance.
1599.68 1604.90 speaker1  You said explodes through the glass, but his body didn't explode, did it?
1604.06 1648.18 speaker3  No, his body did not explode. It's the glass around him that exploded. The glass around him explodes, yeah. Partition gone, glass wall down, shattered into a million little pieces.
1645.70 1670.42 speaker1  it's shown like an empty stool tipped over and nothingness just, you know, there, there. And then you heard a big crash off camera and Beck was so shocked that he is now pointed to the ground with the camera. Yeah, that's perfect. And then after the thing had settled,
1667.58 1674.82 speaker3  to an empty stool across the room to just like chaos having already erupted.
1673.98 1677.60 speaker1  Yeah, exactly.
1676.76 1685.70 speaker2  Yeah. Let's talk. How, what are we doing with breaking points this season? What do you guys want to do?
1682.06 1696.86 speaker3  Do we want to come up with like a phobia or mania together? Do we want to do it just one-on-one or do we want to roll on the table like we did last time?
1692.70 1707.14 speaker2  just cause it's fun to have that as a secret or not, to what happened to make you break.
1705.36 1713.70 speaker3  and half the opposite of your idea.
1712.86 1720.82 speaker2  That's interesting. I don't hate it. That's kind of fun. And you know, vice versa all the way around.
1719.54 1723.74 speaker3  Okay, so let's talk about it.
1722.82 1732.26 speaker2  without shit in his pants. I'll tell you that.
1729.46 1736.42 speaker1  Thomas and his character don't know what it actually was that made him lose his career.
1735.38 1738.08 speaker2  It doesn't really work.
1737.26 1746.20 speaker3  That's fair. Okay, Joe and Thomas, take off your headphones real quick, please. Do you have any ideas right off the top of your head?
1743.62 1756.48 speaker2  So initially I was like, well, it's boring, but like afraid of heights. But the thing that fucked me up wasn't the turtle falling out the window.
1755.18 1761.98 speaker3  Yeah, it was the wet energy. So...
1761.14 1777.72 speaker2  Yeah, let's go. Oh fuck, okay. But still water is fine. I'm not going to die. And obviously we're not going to tell them until it comes up. Exactly.
1776.88 1781.76 speaker3  Rock and roll.
1780.62 1810.90 speaker2  Welcome back, boys. I'm afraid of having a huge penis. And so I start screaming. And I look back and I remember that he has a huge penis and it scares the shit out of me. And I haven't seen cows yet, but I imagine it's big too. Yeah, so Julius kind of, he comes to and... I mean, you're in Fight, Flight or Freezer at this point.
1809.82 1831.98 speaker3  Freeze. Go ahead and roll a D six. That's a three. So you're going to fight. Fight, yeah.
1829.84 1843.34 speaker2  Well, no, yeah, fight. Fucking attack a doctor.
1842.02 1851.06 speaker3  Go ahead and roll. Are you using your hands or are you going to grab something and utilize a weapon of some sort?
1848.84 1856.90 speaker2  There's broken glass everywhere.
1855.90 1860.14 speaker3  What's close to me?
1858.78 1862.38 speaker2  It just doesn't slide across grass floors like it might on something.
1861.10 1866.22 speaker3  Oh yeah. Exactly.
1863.42 1872.84 speaker2  There's a whole medical cart like right in front of you. Yeah, I'm going to grab the blood pressure monitor.
1871.64 1879.46 speaker3  Okay, awesome.
1878.54 1892.30 speaker1  I don't mind.
1889.46 1898.14 speaker3  who just helped your friend and they're backing up and they are really, really confused.
1896.66 1901.50 speaker1  And they see the crazed look in your eye.
1899.14 1929.38 speaker3  And they grabbed the medical cart and kind of wheel it backwards away from you. Julius is screaming, The two look at each other and they look back at you and then they look at each other and then they dip. Probably the best solution.
1924.74 1934.34 speaker1  and he's nodding vigorously to whoever is in the room still.
1931.50 1940.14 speaker3  and the body of Chuck in the other room at this point.
1937.86 1969.02 speaker2  He was furiously taking notes while And as soon as he senses that like the audio is right, he motions to Beck to roll and he says, and the chief suspect, his political rival is an unknown condition. Tune in to Can Action News for more.
1966.12 1990.82 speaker3  Stevie is standing there with eyes, absolutely as wide as eyes can be. Yeah, I didn't think this would happen. Did you get that?
1988.78 2001.30 speaker1  and is looking at the viewfinder and realizes he didn't really get much and his face kind of slacks. Fuck.
1999.66 2027.18 speaker3  Oh shit. You like wanna break glass.
2024.26 2044.42 speaker2  Julius whips around and his like teeth gritted and like fucking spit coming out of his mouth and fucking hit. and he says, you're Julius Summers, City Action News
2041.90 2051.98 speaker1  Beck has the camera up and is catching this.
2051.14 2064.70 speaker2  The turtle? I don't know. Sent who? The turtle's in him. Oh, is in who?
2059.94 2087.26 speaker3  just absolutely covered in like cuts and blood and is covered in sweat, just like drenched clothes and not lifeless, he's breathing. You can tell like his dry fit green polo is kind of bobbing slowly up and down. Is that medical wrap still lying on the ground?
2086.06 2095.32 speaker2  We're gonna take this everywhere and heal all our wounds all the time.
2093.90 2109.74 speaker3  The only thing that you guys still have is the blood pressure monitor.
2107.02 2128.34 speaker2  or just like kind of minor cuts and stuff? from falling through a glass window, have they?
2124.82 2139.40 speaker3  You definitely can't have an 18 inch long piece of glass stuck in your upper thigh, butt area and then lose a third of your blood and have two blood transfusions on the operating table and-
2137.58 2150.50 speaker2  Yeah, not never have your penis work right again.
2148.86 2154.96 speaker3  right? Yeah, you said-
2154.12 2156.92 speaker1  No.
2154.96 2160.56 speaker2  No cilia in your pee hole.
2158.96 2217.48 speaker3  No cilia in your pee hole, the synthetic bouncy walkway up to the second floor, you see through the glass wall on the east side of the room you're currently in, this pencil-like woman with the spiky hair you know as Barbara Bidwell, the wife of Chuck Bidwell, as she's running into this room going,
2215.92 2226.96 speaker0  what's this, what happened? What happened here, what did you do?
2226.12 2234.60 speaker1  Well done.
2233.46 2250.42 speaker2  The mayor's dead. Yes. And your husband might be too soon. And for a brief moment, I think your husband was the mayor, officially.
2247.52 2263.46 speaker3  Now her hands are bleeding, her knees are bleeding It's okay, Chucky, it'll be okay. And she's kind of like slapping his face and it's like, wake up, wake up, wake up.
2261.30 2277.54 speaker0  Medical, medical! Barbara, Barbara,
2273.90 2282.26 speaker1  because they were like on their not way a minute ago.
2280.10 2286.26 speaker2  and then they fled in terror. You might want to try to call them again.
2284.26 2292.10 speaker1  It's like they didn't want to help. They didn't want to help?
2290.70 2294.26 speaker3  Okay, and she pulls out one of the same-
2292.10 2297.62 speaker2  Full disclosure, Julius beat some of them away
2295.40 2314.14 speaker3  As she's pulling out her radio device, she looks at you and she's like, Medical, medical, yeah. We need a medical up to the second floor of the lab. Yeah, right by the entrance.
2312.50 2350.10 speaker2  but she's got a very sultry voice. and describes what I did to the doctors, I kind of like come do more. And I'm like, that's fucking, that's ridiculous. and he looks at Beck and does the rolling signal and then like tries without asking permission to mic up Barbara. We constantly do this. even though it's completely unnecessary. It's always, he is always.
2348.74 2359.86 speaker1  He is, he is.
2358.54 2396.34 speaker3  She swats your hand away and the medical staff tentatively, oh. Like kind of dip toe in. Inches towards you and they're keeping their distance away from Julius. while moving to do their job, which is to get Chuck Bidwell up onto this bulletin carriage. Bulletin carriage?
2395.22 2400.22 speaker1  That was incredible. Oh my God.
2398.14 2422.50 speaker2  Okay, do you not know what bullpen means or what bulletin means?
2421.28 2431.38 speaker3  It's a big hat. It's a big helmet.
2429.06 2462.34 speaker2  They all look a little different, but the best ones. They were really popular in like the late 70s and 80s. And now I'm gonna Google bulletin carriage. Yeah, that's what I thought you were looking up. I'll do it right now. You guys still like that meme, right? Of course you do. Of course you do. We're gonna do it enough that it's our meme.
2458.04 2479.94 speaker1  toward the belabored breathing body of Chuck. You're gonna be okay. Or is it Sandro?
2478.66 2493.86 speaker3  He's not awake. What are you? And they're moving him into this cart and they begin to kind of cart him out of this room. The medical staff don't want to be around you three at all. Specifically Julius.
2492.82 2497.66 speaker1  Makes sense.
2494.90 2503.46 speaker3  And of course Barbara is just at the side of her husband, Chuck.
2500.86 2513.50 speaker1  So are we now being left in this room by ourselves?
2512.38 2527.54 speaker3  you guys have looked around here. Go ahead and roll that search. You were previously in a conference room that overlooked this area. So there's a big table off to the side
2526.70 2529.02 speaker1  Oh nice.
2527.54 2530.74 speaker3  It's a 38 on a 40.
2529.90 2551.78 speaker2  I got a 34 and a 60. I got a 42 on a 70. Okay, so success is all around. Wait, did you say 32? 42. Oh, I thought you said 32 and then we all would have had 30s and that would have been full out.
2550.42 2616.72 speaker3  It was an empty office. No one was working in there today, but it just has kind of a spartan desk and anything cool on that desk. that you might not need a key card in this whole place as doors don't seem to be too much of an issue. Walls might need a clicker. which will be able to open up any doors or walls that you come across while you were here in Grover's Gorge. Excellent. Congratulations. Along with that. I'm the mayor now. You all hear murmuring and it's coming from out front of the lab kind of by the statues and it's almost like you can hear a crowd gathering.
2613.16 2630.72 speaker2  instead of being directly opposite the mob. If we're inside it filming, getting interviews and stuff, they're less likely to turn on us for killing their mayor. Very true. Also, we don't tell them.
2628.64 2634.80 speaker1  I'm already an animal killer here.
2632.64 2635.92 speaker2  There's no proof of it anymore.
2634.80 2646.84 speaker1  He looks at his leg. If you guys don't think they're gonna turn on me,
2642.28 2665.68 speaker2  Now, Beck, I know this might seem harsh and even unpleasant, but if they start to turn on you, all you have to do is show them your headphones. That should buy us some time. The trauma of getting godled seems to pause the psyche.
2663.56 2687.40 speaker1  Yeah, yeah, man, I like it. I mean, I don't like it. It's awful and it sounds like these people are maybe being subjected to inhumane things, but I like it for our purposes now. Beck looks at Stevie at this point. Yeah. to enter this scenario.
2684.46 2701.46 speaker3  so I didn't want to really give too much away, I guess now that that's done, it doesn't matter anymore, but I would say we're kind of all in the same fucked situation at this point.
2699.58 2709.96 speaker2  though if you had told us your identity, it would have allowed us to prepare a more comprehensive infiltration.
2707.52 2716.66 speaker3  and then next time that I do this, I'll let you know. Okay.
2714.90 2726.94 speaker2  on your mom's side of the family. Perhaps give us a couple of weeks to prepare.
2724.82 2732.10 speaker3  come across her face for the first time. She's been really nervous this whole time.
2729.46 2743.38 speaker2  What do you think the chances of us going out there and being apprehended and sent to, I saw the judge, I assumed, god-old jail for killing an animal and maybe the mayor?
2740.70 2753.02 speaker1  Hang on, real fast, just so we're all on the same page. We had nothing to do with the turtle,
2748.02 2756.72 speaker2  I mean, it was quite old, and it needed a lot of makeup.
2754.26 2760.36 speaker1  None of us were anywhere near it, right?
2759.52 2762.16 speaker2  Can I human that?
2761.32 2769.72 speaker3  84. Yeah, seems.
2766.20 2773.62 speaker2  Let's get a shot of the crowd from above before we join, at least.
2771.60 2782.72 speaker1  Yeah, that kind of creeps to the edge. He doesn't want to pull focus up to himself up there, so he's maybe holding the camera out a little bit, using the viewfinder at an angle.
2779.40 2800.78 speaker2  Oh yeah, this has to be incognito and stealthy. Otherwise, it's just the three of us standing over at the fucking balcony where they're pointing down. Yeah.
2798.28 2807.36 speaker3  Yeah, I'm gonna need the videographer roll here.
2805.80 2815.08 speaker1  Ooh. Very nice.
2811.16 2828.60 speaker3  where you know that in the ceiling above, there's a pattern to where if most people are looking up toward you, the camera kind of blends in with what would be behind it. Smart man.
2826.16 2833.48 speaker2  The ceiling is just a tesseract of a camera.
2831.04 2852.40 speaker3  Yeah, it sounds like a pretty cool ceiling. Hey, let me tell you something right now.
2850.12 2861.36 speaker2  you probably aren't scared of shit.
2859.80 2883.72 speaker1  I can't remember, were you saying the stuff we were doing what we were doing, which is just doing interviews for City Action News. That's what we do. That's what we do and that's what we did and that's all that we were doing. All right. That's all we saw and that's all we saw.
2882.60 2926.32 speaker2  And he puts his hand up. And then we reservoir dogs like out of the building all on a line, all very confidently like,
2921.44 2990.12 speaker3  and the crowd immediately parts and standing there, you see a rail thin man with a balding, mostly already balded head. Is this another pencil person? He's wearing a tattered three piece double breasted suit. Turtle, turtle. But his skin that you can see is bruised and scratched and seems to cover his entire body. But the suit covers most of that. And he is rabid, almost foaming at the mouth. And he drags a long thin cane against the ground as he approaches you. for the murder of our mayor, Sandra the turtle.
2989.04 2995.74 speaker2  He was placed carelessly.
2992.14 3025.54 speaker3  Just Cal who's talking right to him cause he's walking right up to Cal as he drags that cane. Not even for damage. It literally does no hit points of damage to you. It is to shut you up and put you in your place.
3022.60 3049.72 speaker1  and his reaction is not to stand out. His friend just got hit. A guy comes running up.
3046.18 3101.38 speaker2  When he sits back, it's like when Beck saw Cal get hit. Excuse me, but this man is an employee of City Action News. We were invited here to cover your community. I guess if he's throwing punches, we're going to fight. While he's talking, Julius is going to try to pin a microphone on his. He's distracted. He was trying to fight Cal.
3099.22 3115.60 speaker3  He looks down and he's like, yes, these words need to be heard, of course. You will know your place, good sir.
3113.44 3125.52 speaker2  First things first for the viewers And he wants to like persuade or fluff that guy.
3124.44 3185.70 speaker3  So go ahead and roll. He's going to roll a human against your persuade. with a higher critical success, I quit with a 33 and he looks at the camera and he smirks and he looks back at you. And when he says the landlord, you can feel the chill run down the spine of all in attendance of this crowd. In a tattered three piece double-breasted suit that mostly covers the bruises and scratches that are all over his body.
3182.40 3196.52 speaker1  Beck wants to twiddle his headphones just to try, like as though trying to tempt a dog with a treat.
3193.00 3202.48 speaker3  It's not nice, which everyone's clothes here are nice. And it's also all over the place color wise.
3201.64 3205.92 speaker2  right?
3205.08 3226.96 speaker3  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not like... I mean, style wise. Oh, style wise, yeah. It's just kind of like a big boxy cut. It might even be like eighties or some shit. I think Luke was on the same page as me.
3226.12 3236.98 speaker1  Yeah, for sure. So at least it's not the body thereof and his name isn't Sandro. So I don't know if this is the case or not.
3233.80 3245.96 speaker2  I just thought Luke was expressing his mania about seeing turtle bodies fly into other people. Is that the shit you fucking saw?
3244.36 3250.56 speaker3  or you gonna talk about it out of character?
3247.60 3254.36 speaker2  Will you please let us have a conversation, Zach?
3253.00 3263.44 speaker3  for you all to have a conversation as he is doing his best to keep you quiet and in your place. Yeah.
3262.60 3286.06 speaker2  Yeah. I better damn well be guilty. What authority do you have to place us under arrest?
3282.34 3312.66 speaker3  you see the judge wearing the powdered wig and the judge's robes. And he looks back and he says, in order to make a decision. And then he's going to start prodding you like a farmer poking cattle to kind of get you guys to stand all together in one spot.
3309.96 3338.58 speaker2  Cal stands right where he is and he says, you're insinuating that the judge over there, that's your authority, but what is their authority? None of you are agents of the state or the federal government. You have no right to put us on trial
3335.62 3372.66 speaker3  as you've been making your plea and Vernon Covington looks down at you, smiles really big and starts laughing. Where are your courts? Where are your police officers?
3368.86 3393.18 speaker2  to us you might want, but you do not do it with the grace of the law that you spit on and they will come for you. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but the name Cal Colorado means something in this town and he will not be sacrificed for some fucking turtle.
3390.68 3405.86 speaker3  He looks at Beck Wilder and Julius Summers and he says, any squawking from the other two? Looks over at Stevie. And you down there? Anything from you?
3404.32 3424.68 speaker2  and Julius wants to try to grab it and snap it over his huge fucking thighs. Awesome. Awesome. I'm gonna use my luck and that's a nine.
3422.92 3458.74 speaker3  I'm gonna tell you to not use your luck. Yeah. Okay, yeah. I'm gonna be nice and tell you, no, I think that just seems super fair. I rolled a 77. Nope. That is a critical cane success.
3457.28 3466.46 speaker1  What? Why does a cane- Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
3464.44 3486.46 speaker3  Blood starts spurting everywhere and you hit the ground unconscious immediately. stay conscious at this point in time. As Vernon Covington stands over your body.
3485.62 3510.42 speaker2  He is. Yeah, Julius, I pass my con check. So Julius is on the ground, face bloodied, and also looking blood.
3508.94 3517.54 speaker1  Holy shit. I'm almost dead.
3516.46 3520.78 speaker2  I don't like this guy.
3517.54 3688.24 speaker3  Vernon Covington stands over the body of Julius Summers and looks out to the crowd and says, The two medical workers in the crowd kind of raise their hand and one of them speaks up And points at Julius. Vernon Covington puts his hands in the air. Men are, judge. And there's a glimmer of hope in Stevie's eyes. But as you're staring into those hope-filled eyes, you hear from behind. the heat and steam rises, crawling up the wooden boards And as the flag unfurls from the top of the highest mast, the fog dissipates and reveals text that reads, And then the credits start to come up on the screen for like, you know, before the movie actually starts, but the names of everyone are coming up. And it says, Luke Gensman, Joe Terry, Zach Reeves, and Beth May. Teeter totter turtle die.
