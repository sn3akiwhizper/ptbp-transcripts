0.00 65.54 speaker0  God damn it, y'all. Shit just keeps getting weirder and weirder around here. It's your trap tricky trusted teacher wolf the dog, and I am no longer surrounded by walls. From my cage, I can see that there is a lot of bizarre alien thingies all around me. Bio luminescence, mushroomy thingies. Bullshit working conditions is what this is. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from At Super Nerd Jeff tweeted about the show and tagged At Pretending Pod, the second coolest thing you can do in Slovenia. The first, dance with the fairies on Bled Island. if you know what I mean.
63.90 71.22 speaker1  but I am gonna have.
68.22 279.94 speaker0  I hope this message reaches you safely, wolf. I don't know which lines of communication are safe these days. Handlers, agents, and dogs everywhere could take a leaf out of your creepy freckled human skin book. To my own agents, it is coming. The future we have waited and worked so long for. Foretold in years past, born of pestilence and fermented in solitude. Prepare yourselves. Much love from the safe house in Slovenia. Keep up the fine work, fellas. Now I don't know where your safe house is, Jeff, but if you ever run into the dragon that kicks it under Ljubljana Castle, tell him wolf says he regrets calling him a girthy drake, and I miss their earthy quakes. I bet all that's just for Jeff. Unless a few of y'all have read a book or two on Slovenia. tag at pretending pod on Instagram, tag pretending to be people on Facebook or fuck Mark Zuckerberg, and holler about it to pretendingpod at gmail.com. Also, money. We'll take it. If you wanna join the Patreon exclusive t-shirt club, head on over to patreon.com slash pretending pod. we're gonna take that money, we're gonna match it, and we're gonna buy blankets and tents for folks who need them this winter.

You'll get a butt ton of bonus content and the fuzzy warm feeling of helping others. Last time, Incel accused a cool mom of being on drugs, accused the sheriff of not caring enough about a missing girl, accused the father of that missing girl and Alderman of Grover'sville, Tennessee of being produced by inbreeding, the Dilbert guy, or both. Finally, they called Merle's shut eye, pretended to be a Clark County deputy, and learned that Scott Adams has two rooms there at the same motel they're staying in. but now for something absolutely impeccable,
278.22 323.78 speaker1  Psy moves out, but the eyes hold one throw I gotta work in the morning And this shit's so important So I can't get high No, I can't get high Theinge siega die I can't get high There must be something inside of me Does anybody know why? I can't get high
322.82 339.98 speaker2  David. Hi. Luke has a question for you. Oh, no.
337.38 346.10 speaker3  No, I just like thought of it. I think I was like pooping and I thought of it. So, all right.
343.78 354.08 speaker2  If you make a lie gross enough, no one questions it.
350.94 371.42 speaker3  This is from the dome. David, you can pick only one movie that Tom Hanks is in and keep Tom Hanks in it, but then you have to replace every other movie he's in with a different actor, but then you have to pick who that actor is.
369.06 386.10 speaker2  So, three part question, two part question. One, what movie is Tom Hanks going to stay in his role and then what actor would you replace every other Tom Hanks role with? Oh, that's good. He's gonna stay in Forrest Gump.
384.80 397.90 speaker3  Yeah, he's gonna stay in Forrest Gump. I know that much. So like, what are some highlights? What movies do we need to think about? Philadelphia Castaway.
397.06 398.90 speaker2  Terminal.
397.90 401.40 speaker3  Turner and Hooch, Terminal. Sully. Sully.
400.56 412.42 speaker2  Sully. Joe versus volcano. You've got male, Sleepless in Seattle.
410.58 421.48 speaker3  Oh, nice.
420.14 428.34 speaker2  besides like Gary Busey.
424.90 433.46 speaker3  where he's in the bathroom and he just starts screaming?
431.70 443.96 speaker2  but in terminal. In every movie. What were your answers? I heard Forrest Gump was a yes.
441.34 464.66 speaker3  I said Forrest Gump and then Colin Hanks. I was gonna keep him in Castaway and maybe like Sam Rockwell.
460.50 520.90 speaker2  where he is the guy. I feel like you don't know what you're gonna say yet. Yeah, I'll give you some time. just to keep that movie pristine as possible, I don't want Vin Diesel playing that role,
518.26 524.38 speaker3  the Chronicles of Riddick is all Tom Hanks now.
522.90 531.86 speaker4  That would be awesome.
529.86 555.48 speaker2  that means we're family.
552.38 563.14 speaker3  and there was also, he had a second room full of research.
562.26 568.30 speaker2  Maybe he mentions it
566.66 594.62 speaker3  really helps me with my research, Riker Yates. You live in New York. Do you ever just go to Riker Island for fun?
592.98 611.70 speaker2  But yeah, I generally avoid Rikers. At least what the tourist guides say is try not to. Do you ever get sent there against your will for the crimes you've committed? Smart guy.
608.80 616.18 speaker3  Not a prereq for my appearance here.
613.90 639.90 speaker2  There's a reason why I have to record this remotely and I can't fly in for the show. I'm not allowed to leave the states. That's the nicest sell I've ever seen. They let you have so many games. It's true, it's true. So we're at the hotel.
634.90 667.34 speaker3  to certain other detectives' hearts and another property. or who you called, the place you called, the person you called was Riker Yates. If I recall correctly, did you call on the fancy DEA Crown Victoria car phone or did you call from the city hall? I think we called from the office, yeah. The city hall office, okay. So you led away the alderman. Right, I think we told him to fuck off.
664.98 670.86 speaker2  Yes, like many of the other NPCs
668.62 713.78 speaker3  you have thoroughly harassed them asking about disappearing people and you constantly bring up aliens for no apparent reason even though that's a complete trigger point for every resident around here. You've made a phone call. It is what, around probably about midnight at this point on thirsty Thursday night. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh yeah, so we could go down to the reservoir. Do you guys, do you think we should... I mean, we're gonna go back to the motel. Anyway, we gotta stay there. Should we go crash the kids party?
711.24 723.02 speaker2  I mean, we should at least drive by probably, yeah.
718.02 729.34 speaker1  in the youth where all these missing kids are coming from.
725.54 748.70 speaker2  We have that raging Billy Ray just shouting in pain. Who fucking knows if there's a lot of kids missing? and then everyone seems to not be worried about missing people. I'm worried that these teens themselves won't fucking be worried that any of their friends are missing. That's a worrying thought.
745.42 771.98 speaker3  My theory is that we've only talked to grown adults. Maybe the younger crew might actually be concerned about it because it's their friends that are going.
770.58 793.26 speaker2  The supernatural kind. now that it was just the four of us in here, do I come across as a little too fucking strong?
791.98 796.42 speaker3  I'm not a fan of that. Why?
794.94 804.06 speaker1  Sometimes you do say things that I feel put the investigation in jeopardy.
802.42 845.60 speaker2  that she has on, but she's not using her like cardigan persona currently. And she kind of pulls the sleeves down over her tattoos. She had them rolled up from the intensity of the phone call and the email and the computer. she looks at all of you and her face changes again. but he looks like he's seen this before and he's even more worried now.
841.58 870.28 speaker1  Can we call on that other version of you if we need it? Sure, for now.
868.64 872.60 speaker2  It's better though than before.
871.12 884.16 speaker3  Tan gets a little jealous.
882.76 908.40 speaker2  and her eyes get really big. I'll be good. Yeah. Okay.
905.60 914.88 speaker3  Yeah, let me talk to the president. What are your thoughts on aliens?
913.16 924.32 speaker2  We call Murrells County Bunker. And I haven't heard the ring yet.
922.60 932.20 speaker0  Hey y'all, it's Murrells.
929.40 936.12 speaker2  and we were wondering how long the bunker's open.
934.04 956.12 speaker3  Well, technically it's open till 12, but if you say the password, it's open till two. Big League Chew, that's cool.
955.28 978.80 speaker2  Hugh Jazz?
977.96 986.32 speaker4  I hang up, yeah.
983.88 992.80 speaker2  that's taken the nation by storm these last couple of years.
989.92 1003.20 speaker3  for David to just bring a gun out as a prop. It's like, yeah, I got a phone. He fires in and bullets come out of our TV screen.
1001.68 1006.12 speaker2  Four dead.
1005.14 1023.64 speaker3  before you go to the reservoir? Sure, why not? How many prank phone calls does it take
1020.24 1035.56 speaker2  And second, can I change Ice Cube to my answer for switching with Tom Hanks?
1033.72 1036.56 speaker3  That's Ice T, Ice T.
1035.56 1048.30 speaker2  Which one's Ice Cube? Ice Cube is the- Are we there yet? Are we there yet? And 21 Jump Street, 22 Jump Street, Barbershop. Man, Barbershop's a funny movie.
1047.48 1069.36 speaker3  All right, let's go. It'd be good. What do we see? Well, more importantly, what do you hear? So in between your prank phone calls on the way there, a bump in tune from 1990 comes on. Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby, just to get you in the mood.
1066.72 1072.24 speaker4  All right, stop, collaborate and listen.
1071.40 1099.72 speaker2  Something. You guys are holding me tightly. Flowing like a hot daily and nightly. When will it ever stop, yo? I don't know. Turn out the lights and I'll glow to the extreme. I rock the mic like a vandal. I think your chances with Cindy just went way down.
1098.88 1117.50 speaker3  hold on, three teens loitering and a beat up Ford pickup truck and pounding cans of, hold on, Oh, that's an 11.
1115.36 1122.32 speaker2  Is this 13 Mile Island? Oh my God.
1119.48 1131.68 speaker3  They're drinking Milwaukee's Best Ice. Excellent.
1130.84 1140.20 speaker2  Oh yeah. No, no, no, no.
1138.00 1143.58 speaker3  A two is Colt 45. Oh my gosh.
1142.74 1150.76 speaker2  in 1990?
1148.80 1155.40 speaker3  probably existed 20 years ago.
1153.92 1161.26 speaker2  Milwaukee's Best Ice.
1157.22 1170.30 speaker3  because Lando Calrissian was effectively the spokesperson. Hold on, let me roll for you.
1169.26 1179.64 speaker2  That'd be Bud Light. Doody Doody. Anheuser-Busch. Wait, what did they say? In Bev. Wait, what?
1178.70 1185.06 speaker4  Doody Doody.
1183.98 1189.40 speaker2  Poopy Poopy. Dilly Dilly.
1188.56 1194.54 speaker3  Dilly Dilly. Yes, there we go.
1193.04 1195.50 speaker2  I liked the dog ones.
1194.54 1196.34 speaker3  Those were good.
1195.50 1210.18 speaker2  Anyway. Oh, where the dogs say Budweiser. Yeah, the beast.
1207.42 1218.20 speaker3  finds the open 18-pack, grabs one, cracks it open, and just kind of wanders into where the kids are.
1216.86 1219.86 speaker2  They've been there for a little while.
1218.20 1237.78 speaker3  It's a 30-rack. It's about half consumed, and it gives that distinct, almost gasoline smell as you open it up. And you walk over towards the kids.
1235.62 1244.36 speaker2  depending on how long they've been out here. Okay, Joe? Yeah, and it's ice beer, which means it's a little bit higher than your normal three-two.
1243.54 1252.44 speaker4  That's right. Going with some loose sluices.
1251.36 1262.76 speaker3  ATF, you know? And he sniffs his beer. This is a good one.
1261.38 1271.64 speaker2  I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but it would be super cool if you just walked over there
1266.64 1274.76 speaker3  No, he savors the beautiful taste of- The beast ice.
1273.48 1279.92 speaker2  Of the ice.
1277.96 1291.00 speaker3  This isn't super weird to you that we're just here. We got some questions for you. Who are you?
1290.08 1300.24 speaker2  Mine is-
1298.48 1313.16 speaker3  we haven't been out to the reservoir for a thirsty Thursday in quite a while. We figured we'd come down here and we just ran into you guys. Well, we are. We're older than you, you know?
1312.26 1319.32 speaker2  Do you know any- Are you sure? Have any of your friends disappeared?
1318.48 1349.12 speaker3  Maybe. just because they're not around. But some of your friends aren't around. I'm only 12.
1347.08 1356.76 speaker2  Which kid are we talking about?
1354.12 1369.64 speaker3  sorry, these individuals might be children. The rest of you are like, yeah, they're probably adults. It's fine.
1366.04 1378.92 speaker4  is changing who he is as a person and making him worse.
1377.72 1383.24 speaker3  It's called research.
1381.56 1409.18 speaker2  I don't think you should be drinking right now. I think you should pour that beer out like a hard ass. You seen her in a while?
1408.22 1411.10 speaker4  Who drove?
1410.18 1420.42 speaker3  When was that? 30 minutes ago.
1419.06 1435.10 speaker2  in 30 minutes each. And these kids are 12. They're like, these kids are just on the ground. Like one of them is already dead.
1433.46 1439.70 speaker3  Why are you bothering my friends? Are you Rocky?
1438.86 1447.36 speaker4  Yes. Did you guys drink all of these beers in the last 30 minutes?
1446.30 1457.32 speaker3  I would never. They had seven and a half each.
1456.04 1479.80 speaker2  these kids have the body weight for seven and a half Milwaukee's best ices.
1477.60 1508.64 speaker3  I grab his arm and look at it. The two younger kids, not Rocky, does look like they've pounded seven and a half beers each. However, there seemed to be no effects on them at all.
1507.68 1513.40 speaker1  Ooh.
1512.00 1524.52 speaker2  That's fucking nuts. All right, let's get the fuck out of here and go on to the next place. Could we, hey, could we get your names real quick? I'm Rocky Collins.
1522.40 1533.38 speaker3  Chester Wisman.
1531.76 1550.42 speaker2  How old are you, Mr. Collins? Yeah.
1549.08 1562.08 speaker3  39 on a 40. Harlan fails. He might be lying and is only 20 and he is just worried. He just seems to be shifty because he realizes you're adults and...
1559.52 1575.56 speaker2  Kid, we don't really care how, you know, that you're underage drinking. It's not like we didn't do any of that ourselves, but we just need to know the actual facts. Like, how old are you, son?
1572.68 1580.78 speaker3  but if you help us, I won't. ATF agent, alcohol, tobacco, firearms.
1579.72 1590.58 speaker4  It's just a relief.
1587.80 1616.36 speaker2  that these are actually adults that are now have taken over these 12 year old bodies based on the way that he said that- They just pound in those ices? He said that woman over there, and then was like, I mean that girl, right? So I think-
1614.96 1620.76 speaker3  I just, I caught myself.
1618.52 1621.60 speaker4  I thought I cracked the whole thing open.
1620.76 1627.50 speaker3  Nope. So, Mr., what was it again? Mr. Collins.
1626.66 1628.32 speaker2  Rocky Collins.
1627.50 1647.06 speaker3  Mr. Collins. Yeah. So, do you know Jane Allen? We're a couple years apart. You make it sound like she's not around, that's sure a shame. And you don't have any friends that just haven't been around for like three weeks? Two weeks? Any amount of time.
1646.22 1649.12 speaker4  Any amount.
1648.28 1650.20 speaker3  Where do they go?
1649.12 1657.14 speaker2  They go to the big city.
1656.30 1672.72 speaker3  That checks out. Oh, sometimes there's some big shopping to do in the city. You gotta get your fancy clothes at the Gap
1671.50 1694.00 speaker2  Not as far as I know. And you were 20, that was correct? Ish. Do you want to breathalyze the kids Yeah, let's send them back to Delta Green for testing in there.
1693.16 1702.42 speaker3  Where to? 1 a.m., night one. Wait, the hotel or the bar? I think the bar.
1701.58 1715.82 speaker4  Oh. The late night, Harlan, you gonna stay up? We're gonna have the same conversation we just had
1713.38 1761.26 speaker2  Yeah, they gave us the password, so that's cool. She got real calm earlier. but her methods are pretty unorthodox
1758.66 1783.24 speaker3  Murrell's county bunker is literally stylized almost as if it's some sort of bunker. It's a windowless bar, blocky. The front door is almost like it's for a gang hideout. It is a heavy door with like one of those slots, like an eye slot.
1781.66 1784.42 speaker4  There's a little doorbell on it.
1783.24 1797.86 speaker2  Big League Chew.
1794.54 1857.82 speaker3  but more of like a grab and go beer place and half bar. Again, there's no windows, it's dark. It's stylized with those tin branded beer signs all over the place of every which brand. Some of these brands are even now defunct in the early 90s, some of them are more modern. The place smells like that solvent that a really cheap bar has that just permeates the air and that's all you can smell. You can't smell food, you can't smell the beer, it's just that kind of ambient solvent smell everywhere. And there's only the bartender, there's no one else in there right now. Can you roll for some of those signs? Oh, Rolling Rock, that's fancy.
1856.98 1898.36 speaker2  This one's a little fancier. I like this one. Yeah, it's a limited table. Oh, sorry, we didn't know this town had any kind of connection to that. That's just kind of his new age pickup line that he's been dropping out.
1895.52 1907.44 speaker4  Me and my partner saw you from across the bar
1906.12 1914.68 speaker2  Yes, we're all laughing. I hate it.
1913.84 1924.60 speaker3  Who hates it? Arthur C. Doyle? Just Doyle. But really, though, how many times?
1923.52 1928.96 speaker2  People always ask that.
1926.48 1971.84 speaker3  You don't know anybody that's been abducted or? No. Okay. You Sherlock harassing the locals, I've noticed. People have been talking about these agents going around town, asking questions about the aliens. And that upsets people? Yes, sir. We just want to live in peace.
1970.64 1986.88 speaker2  What aliens? The ones you don't want here.
1984.90 2035.64 speaker3  Sorry to bring up the aliens. Can I have a water? Do you know who killed Jane Allen? Yes. because the nice old lady asked for one and you've been out all day. I chug it. You chug it? Okay. And I've still got my Milwaukee's Best ice Hey, hey! No outside beverages. You gotta shop parrot. Tan chugs it and then goes back to his line of questioning. Who gives you the right to do that? So did you kill Jane Allen or who did it? Why are you accusing me of killing Jane Allen? Well, so it sounds like somebody did kill her then, right? Based off what you just said. I don't know.
2034.60 2043.94 speaker2  That's what I heard. We just tried this with him and he did not crack.
2041.44 2048.80 speaker4  that is strange or unusual in this town. Correct. Everything is fine.
2046.44 2067.10 speaker2  Any of your friends been out of town for a while? No. Oh good, any of your friends? Got no friends.
2062.10 2074.08 speaker1  Are you aware of a Billy Ray Spivvy, Spivvy? Does he frequent this establishment?
2072.08 2099.30 speaker3  I check IDs. Thank you very much. I see that guy over there with the ATF badge trying to trip me up. No, sir. No children in this bar. Can I humint that? Everyone in the bar looks 12 now.
2098.48 2101.56 speaker4  Yeah.
2099.30 2111.72 speaker3  He's poking around just like you, asking about them UFOs. Told him he wasn't allowed to come back here.
2110.04 2113.72 speaker1  Was his line of inquiry similar to ours,
2111.72 2130.52 speaker3  or was he asking different things? Basically the same stuff. This is just a person. I ain't seen him making no comics while he was here, if that's what you're asking. What have you seen him doing while he's here?
2128.64 2133.22 speaker4  Thank you very much for your time.
2132.38 2152.92 speaker3  That is what? You have thoroughly wasted enough time, and now this bar has to close. Both are on the outskirts of town. They're both owned by Murrells. They're conveniently close enough that you could walk from the county bunker to the motel.
2150.46 2157.44 speaker2  And what time is it, like one in the morning right now? Two.
2155.42 2163.04 speaker3  Do you think it's too late to go try to talk to him?
2160.86 2164.98 speaker1  and get this with fresh eyes.
2163.04 2172.06 speaker2  I've gotta sleep and shit and piss, and eat, apparently.
2170.28 2175.26 speaker3  or are we all staying in the same room? Are you gonna check in?
2174.42 2178.86 speaker2  Yeah.
2176.42 2192.98 speaker3  you go to talk to Riker Yates. However, there's a sign up saying, because you didn't even bother to check into the motel.
2190.82 2202.62 speaker1  and was already walking back to the Bronco.
2200.90 2217.26 speaker2  Oh, that Scott was in. We do? We haven't made it into the lobby. Oh, we're not inside the lobby?
2216.42 2265.58 speaker3  No. There's no lobby, so this is, I should say, standard motel, doors open outward, and it's actually, you know what, I'm just gonna give you a map. How about that? Ooh. Perfect. So, 11 room motel, L-shaped. The rooms on one side of the L are kind of double units, two double beds plus kitchenettes. And then there's this, on the other side of the L, it's just standard rooms where it's some beds and then a bathroom, and that's pretty much it. And then in between, in like the joint of the L, there's a manager's office. Right, is that locked? The office is locked, so it has that sign saying basically, come back tomorrow. Yeah. I don't know if Scott's a nice guy or not,
2263.06 2269.20 speaker1  I would not advise just knocking on doors at two in the morning.
2268.06 2281.10 speaker2  Oh, yeah. Sorry, guys, you're not actually full Delta Green. You're the friendlies, we're the agents. You're gonna sleep in your car tonight.
2279.08 2297.62 speaker1  It's actually something I do pretty often It's not, it's just, we stake out places. We have to make sure that we see the comings and goings of people pretty often.
2294.78 2307.54 speaker3  it's cause it's like outside of the casino. I had a bad night, so it's kinda not a great feeling for me, but I guess I'll do it. Well, you'll have a friend.
2304.98 2316.04 speaker2  but we're gonna be doing that for the next, probably till like 6 a.m., it's only like four hours.
2314.42 2365.36 speaker3  like standing outside of the office? Defo, yep. Okay, so as you're doing that, eventually towards the end of the conversation, the lights turn on on the inside. The manager's apartment was back there, so Riker actually lives inside the hotel, and he overheard you talking loudly. It's still September, he had his window open, and eventually all the bickering about cars and sleeping in the car and stuff woke him up. So he comes out in his pajamas, like a nice proper two-piece striped pajama suit, a very handsome gentleman comes to the door, all bleary-eyed. Let me guess, let me guess, you're those agents or whatever that call the hat, right? DEA Task Force, yep, investigating Superman.
2363.66 2376.18 speaker2  Ah, I already, here, paperwork, Just give us the keys, and we'll do it all tomorrow. How about that?
2373.84 2388.82 speaker3  we got four different double bedrooms. Yeah, you're in rooms six to nine.
2387.50 2398.18 speaker4  I'll take the six.
2396.74 2410.06 speaker1  Maybe it's lucky.
2406.62 2448.94 speaker2  Before we get to the rooms, I do wanna ask Riker just a bunch of questions. No, I just don't wanna ask him what rooms Scott Adams is staying in. Now, we understand you have a guest here staying with you, a Mr. Scott Adams. Oh. It'll be all right. We just need to ask him some questions. Just let us know which room he's in. Your hotel is not in danger.
2446.44 2472.30 speaker3  Thank you so much for, I'm sorry to wake you up, but I was not looking forward to sleeping in that car, It's fine. He turns around, goes back in, lights off. Tan goes, goes to bed, he plays a little online poker. No, he doesn't.
2468.54 2478.18 speaker2  We don't know what existed in the 90s. I know you're 17, but.
2477.34 2512.34 speaker3  Oh, yes. It's like a double A battery. Yeah. Every time you like hit something that's at least what, at least three of a kind or whatever, it plays that we're in the money tune. Yeah, monophonic. Yeah. He does that until he loses five times in a row, Anyone else doing anything before bed? Taking a shower, doing anything else?
2508.02 2548.38 speaker2  Cindy puts away all of her clothes in each of the drawers in the motel room and then goes and sets up her toiletries at the bathroom sink and does her good night face wash, puts on a face mask and then heads to bed and has a full blown nightmare. and he wants to take a look at the outside of rooms 10 and 11.
2545.94 2564.50 speaker3  The one thing you notice between the two rooms, the room that was identified as Scott Adams' room, so that's room 10, there's a little bit of cloth sticking out from under the door. It looks like a towel, like a standard hotel towel kind of peeking out from underneath the door.
2562.70 2569.10 speaker2  Like somebody had rolled one up under the door.
2566.98 2578.58 speaker3  the blinds are closed, but you can kind of see through the blinds, nothing on the other side. It's dark, almost as if there was a blanket put up
2575.10 2597.94 speaker2  over the top of the closed blinds. do I hear any sounds or activities, movements? I'm not even gonna make you roll, you hear nothing. Okay. Everyone sleeps through the night.
2595.34 2616.74 speaker3  You notice the office is back open up front. The lights are on again. There's a little bit of movement. However, there's not that many other cars in the parking lot. There's one van, your Bronco, your Crown Vic, and then another rental car. It looks to be a Ford Escort.
2615.58 2621.06 speaker2  The Escort is.
2618.82 2625.06 speaker3  where the other rooms are on the other half of the aisle. And you said we could tell it was a rental?
2622.50 2647.22 speaker2  Escort is definitely a rental.
2643.18 2697.02 speaker3  But if you want a small meal, I got some coffee over here. You know, your offices are the law. I can cut you in on some donuts. I appreciate that, but I'm a little hungry. Hey, you guys wanna go to the Deuce to get some breakfast? And maybe we can ask Scott to come with us. Cracks the door and she's like, sorry. I think maybe we could take Scott to breakfast. Do you wake up Cindy? You wake up the other two as well? Yeah, I knock on their doors as well.
2692.90 2705.02 speaker1  and puts on a new black polo from his suitcase. That's the only difference.
2702.74 2720.98 speaker3  even though he totally knew that it was happening. So he's still wearing the baby blue polo shirt that the neck has been stretched out. But he's happy and he's stoked to go eat breakfast.
2716.58 2739.98 speaker2  He nods approvingly at Harlan's sharp, fresh black polo. And he puts on some sunglasses and says,
2737.58 2787.70 speaker3  Old fashioned knocking, no answer. Riker peeks his head out, looks at you, realizes kind of what's going on, goes back behind the counter, grabs some keys and comes out to you. Do you have a warrant? Do you have a warrant?
2785.58 2795.90 speaker2  or something, but I heard a big clunk and it sounds like we need to get in there pretty quick. would you?
2792.94 2799.46 speaker3  No, no, no, no, that'd be really bad for business.
2797.58 2815.82 speaker2  Goes in, unlocks the door and says, like as soon as we get in there, we search everything as fast as we can.
2813.54 2865.66 speaker3  you catch a really bad odor. Yeah, it's that kind of bad odor. Yeah, okay. It's very, very dark because of that blanket that you can see now was duct taped over the window. Looking around, you see a couple of different things. You see the blankets that have been pulled off the bed and used for that, so clearly the bed is unmade. You see two piles of clothing. One of them is just kind of thrown in the corner. The other one is neatly folded on the table. You also see a Macintosh PowerBook. Is that like a laptop? That's a laptop. That's what laptops looked like in the early 90s. But you see one of those bad boys plugged into the wall. You see a series of documents, junk food containers on the floor, and that's pretty much all you can see as you walk into the room.
2862.78 2869.26 speaker2  and so with that smell, as soon as it hits her nose,
2868.02 2879.38 speaker4  Can't be around any of that,
2874.38 2884.74 speaker3  and he feels physically sick and joins Cindy.
2883.10 2890.46 speaker2  I passed with a 17.
2888.78 2927.76 speaker3  Most of this stuff is very obvious, kind of what you're seeing. You do see some journals sitting around that you didn't initially see on the first pass. and scrawled on the front of one of them is Grover'sville Notebook. which also makes you kind of question his sanity, why anyone would use the wide-ruled versus college-ruled as an adult, but you know, it happens.
2925.66 2935.72 speaker2  When Tan leaves the room,
2933.10 2946.96 speaker4  Yeah, we can go check out the other room. Yeah, sure, but you know that all four of us can't talk all at the same time.
2946.12 2949.46 speaker3  I don't think so. Let's try it.
2948.62 2955.16 speaker2  Start talking. No one would want to listen.
2954.28 2969.24 speaker3  the storage room. Two of you are still searching in the Scott Adams primary room. You're in the bedroom. Are you checking out the notebook then? That's what you want to do?
2966.08 2973.12 speaker2  staring at us or a lump under the covers?
2972.00 2980.08 speaker3  The bed is definitely empty. Okay, I have picked up the notebook,
2978.76 2984.52 speaker2  the bathroom door. And Harlan, where are you?
2982.68 2990.52 speaker1  Well, you told us there were two journals.
2986.10 2998.92 speaker3  The other journal is just some like random UFO nonsense related to his watch the skies.
2996.38 3003.30 speaker1  Can I look at those a little closer with that search rule?
3000.44 3017.00 speaker3  So I'll let you kind of go through them in a little bit, but you're not going to be able to necessarily do it in real time. It's just, it's a mess. This room's been not necessarily like ransacked, but it's just in complete disarray.
3015.38 3021.60 speaker1  Yeah, I'm sitting there looking through that stuff and he's going to the bathroom.
3020.40 3067.04 speaker3  before we get to the other room. So Joe Dean, you get to the bathroom and once the door is fully ajar, you see where the smell is coming from. You see a heavyset man in the bathtub, roughly 34 years old in age, curly black hair and a bushy beard. He's in boxer shorts and wearing a t-shirt Knoxville Fantasy Con 1989. He's up to his chest in water. Clearly the stopper is in the tub. To make matters worse, that water is deep red because you see numerous self-inflicted slashes all over his body, arms, legs, everywhere.
3064.64 3090.56 speaker2  Specifically the arms and legs. If I look at back into the room, are there signs of an individual maybe like increasingly succumbing to this kind of pain? Is that how the room looks destroyed or? No, no pain medication.
3088.48 3104.00 speaker3  that was kind of obvious? He talked about eating a lot and being hungry.
3101.34 3119.64 speaker2  we wanna do in here is look at his computer. and I kind of motioned to Harlan. I'm like, he's in there, you can have a look.
3118.80 3133.74 speaker1  You should look. Do you need a second opinion? I will check, of course.
3130.88 3142.10 speaker2  Harlan should see the insane way in which he died. And then either I can describe that to you or you can go look a look, take a look.
3140.78 3152.90 speaker1  but I can go look in the bathroom. Ooh, like water sloshing or something else?
3150.74 3158.58 speaker3  You see, yes, at the surface, a little bit of bubbling coming up and the water's moving slightly.
3157.34 3167.22 speaker1  I called it, Jody. Did you notice this and I'm just pointing at the bubbles?
3162.22 3184.30 speaker2  Uh, Cindy, you guys wanna come take a look at this real quick? Cindy and Tanner are distracting Riker outside of both of these rooms.
3182.48 3195.06 speaker4  Everyone keeps telling us to go there.
3192.14 3220.02 speaker2  He says to Riker, strange question, maybe. No, you know anybody with- Can you bring me a fitted sheet?
3218.10 3232.74 speaker1  Harlan's still in there and I wanna see if the plug in the tub, is it a pull out? You have to reach in your hand in the water to pull it out or do you have to hit the switch on the side? There's no switch.
3230.64 3236.04 speaker3  to get the spring to trigger or pull it out. It's one or the other.
3235.22 3251.56 speaker1  Yes. Could I find something long like, oh, can I pull the towel rack off? Like just to undo that and I wanna use that to push down on the thing to drain the tub.
3250.72 3256.68 speaker2  with the sheet.
3254.64 3297.30 speaker3  Jodine, you looked initially at the body, right? And you left. Yes. And then you came back in with Harlan? Yes. Give me an alertness roll. than when you were first in the room. And what's different was it looked initially like he had some sort of like large pimple or growth or something on his head, kind of right on his forehead. No hair on it, but it was like a growth on his skull. By the time you come back, it's gone. Harlan, step back.
3293.28 3310.04 speaker1  Harlan is holding the towel rack about to hit the thing.
3307.02 3326.04 speaker3  something coming up from inside the pipes, going up into the bathtub, bang, bang. What do you do?
3324.92 3335.16 speaker2  we all just froze. Yeah.
3331.28 3369.72 speaker3  eventually the clanging pushes through, the stopper bust out in this almost metallic looking liquid starts pouring up through the bloody water. So it starts cascading up into the ceiling, spraying bloody water everywhere. And then this metallic substance starts spraying
3367.60 3376.26 speaker2  And I rolled a six on a 50. Oh, all right.
3373.06 3407.40 speaker3  you're able to just back out really quickly out of the bathroom, not getting wet from any of the either bloody water or this metallic stuff, but it sprays up as a geyser and then falls back down. And it's kind of mixed into this bloody water as the tub is draining. And everything that's sprayed up onto the walls and ceiling kind of conjoins together, almost like, you know, mercury beating together and starts going back, joining the rest of the stuff in the tub and starts swirling down the drain. Should we try to collect some?
3406.56 3416.84 speaker1  I don't know. I was not prepared for anything like this. Mr. Winners?
3414.56 3429.06 speaker4  but you forgot to collect our homework.
3426.80 3438.96 speaker3  Yes, they most definitely can. Also, I have to pee so bad. Are we close to pee time? Yes, we are. That's a fail.
3437.60 3444.60 speaker1  Oh no.
3442.64 3482.68 speaker3  Take four sanity damage each. Is it five for like temporary insanity? Yeah. Okay. Yep. You should have made it five. but you're not wet from the metallic oozy stuff.
3481.68 3511.80 speaker2  for you and me, Joe. a Wendy's cup or some shit, whatever's there. And he just tries to grab a drop that's falling down from the ceiling and like catch it in the cup.
3506.80 3531.64 speaker3  It recognizes its path almost was obstructed. It rapidly expands from being just a couple drops in size, outward, super flat, super wide, shattering the cup.
3529.44 3562.18 speaker2  walks out of the bathroom and closes the door. this was not the right fitted sheet. Like why don't you, can we go, from like the deepest part of your linen closet?
3559.38 3570.48 speaker4  That way we can do a safety check in there before you go. 12, if you have it.
3568.24 3593.40 speaker2  We really do need those linens quite quickly. You can open it when you need it. Yeah. Exactly.
3589.94 3620.42 speaker3  you can reason that the entire tub is drained. Now you have this room with a computer, some journals, and also room 11. Now the other thing that you can't see on the map that I didn't mention, there's actually a door inside of this room conjoining room 10 and 11 as well. You can also try to go into room 11. There's a mech in that one closet.
3618.30 3622.08 speaker2  Tanner and Cindy will go in there.
3621.26 3667.74 speaker3  Into room 11? you see a second motel room. This one in much better condition. However, you do see it's been lived in. This is not in fact a room for storage. There is clothing, a couple of suitcases, and there is a young girl curled up in the fetal position Jane? Yeah?
3664.42 3691.66 speaker2  pull a second cardigan out of her purse and go to wrap it around the back of this poor girl.
3689.82 3714.76 speaker3  It was three weeks ago. She is about six months pregnant.
3710.78 3728.70 speaker4  Jane, I have a really strange question to ask you. Take it calm, okay? How long have you been pregnant?
3727.86 3748.86 speaker3  Yeah. Yes.
3747.50 3754.08 speaker4  No, no. Any smells?
3752.08 3759.16 speaker2  Yeah, I want to look at her arms.
3757.96 3797.48 speaker3  What about her belly? Yeah. So you'll find those same kind of incisions all on her lower abdomen. She is just wearing a t-shirt inside. Another thing you'll notice in this room, there are food containers galore. Compared to Scott Adams' room, there are 10 times as many food containers. No pain meds. Tylenol? No.
3796.04 3803.32 speaker4  Will you give this girl some?
3800.76 3820.18 speaker2  I don't know much about pregnancy. and we're like, none of us will have the medicine skill. How about that?
3817.44 3856.72 speaker3  Yeah, it's not a crit fail, just a regular fail. I don't wanna see her. She can't see me like this.
3855.00 3862.02 speaker2  What could he offer you?
3860.16 3880.92 speaker3  the lights and everything. And he was in town and asking about aliens and stuff, and I thought maybe that would be it. I don't know, but he paid for this room. He was bringing me food.
3878.34 3887.62 speaker4  No, he just, he was keeping me safe.
3885.78 3902.82 speaker3  He said, it's not safe here in town, and I have to go elsewhere.
3900.06 3912.70 speaker4  No, he told me to keep a low profile. And what did you do with him the day before that? He just told me to stay here.
3909.88 3919.68 speaker3  and once he had enough evidence,
3918.26 3927.62 speaker4  Did you shake his hand? Did you high-five him?
3925.22 3972.74 speaker3  but I think maybe that's it. Now you can all roll me a sanity. Having seen this young girl who is four weeks pregnant, but showing the signs of being around six months pregnant, seven months pregnant. Yeah, it's a fail. I had to fail for me as well. Ooh.
3967.74 3987.54 speaker2  and he's just like Luke is not sure what to do next. that they've been talking to her, that Jodine and Harlan have gone through the papers for Harlan and the computer for Jodine?
3985.98 3992.14 speaker3  Let's go through the paper first.
3990.34 3999.98 speaker2  that they could learn that would be cool enough to end an episode on? Dude, I have to be so fast. Yeah, you got any real prizes in there?
3998.82 4003.90 speaker3  It's in front of you. Read off some of it.
4003.06 4011.82 speaker2  Gotcha.
4008.46 4037.78 speaker1  There were three cows, a goat, and 20 chickens. A cow was missing an udder, but otherwise in good health. Spotted three more in a roadside survey. Didn't know who the farmer was. We've also got accounts of missing time, chopper sightings, lights.
4034.10 4058.50 speaker2  Allen, Barn, Thomas, Jacobs, Cartwright, and Anderson never go home. Never go home. Do we know any of those names besides Allen? Barn is Merle. Cartwright is the family from Bonanza. And also.
4057.54 4063.02 speaker1  we would have seen their names.
4060.98 4069.70 speaker3  and then you would have seen the other names too.
4068.38 4072.10 speaker2  We knew he wasn't going home.
4071.26 4074.26 speaker1  Exactly.
4072.10 4099.10 speaker2  But I thought it was like, Their story ends here.
4096.18 4134.74 speaker1  And this shit's so important So I can't get high
4129.74 4160.50 speaker4  And I don't wanna try Please, my smile, won't you spare me
4156.50 4246.26 speaker1  Spider's out the line With some funny-looking dudes With some fucked-up faces And I can't help but feel it I'll always be at the bottom ["I Gotta Work In The Morning"] I think I'm allergic or something Better go on with nothing So I won't get high No, I won't get high By all means, do it if it helps
4241.26 4250.26 speaker4  And I don't wanna try Please, my smile, won't you spare me Thanks for watching!
