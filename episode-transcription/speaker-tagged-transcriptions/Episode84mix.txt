Pettymore who could burn folks with his hands John also recalled being chased by two tall gaunt Fancy men in suits while being pushed in a wheelchair by Uncle Don Keith also remembered seeing those lemmy Translucent fellas infiltrate his father's estate the day Ferguson was given the watch John put the watch on and saw his daddy steal him the vector and adopted baby from the Kane Family burning down their house But unaware of Adam Kane's survival Keith slapped the watch on and saw John murder him and Clark in order to take the watch and walk down into beans pond But the watch didn't come off his wrist when he came back to reality and he became real Disappearance showed them a picture of the founders of contention the face of Silas Cole had settled on the face of Keith Vigna and a Reflection in the glass looked a whole lot like that miss until DB Keith lost it and Keith did up Grinding the old stoner into the old stone ground. This was a step too far Harry and Gary asked them to leave at gunpoint and the three headed south into a tunnel and toward beanspond Never mind They completely ignored the spell that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's back pocket as well as the fact that Casey Kristoff the longtime janitor of the first Church of contention was clearly Eavesdropping instead of reading his book. It'd be a shame if old Casey wasn't actually down there in the sewers to avoid Big Daddy Kane, but rather doing Reconnaissance for his employer. Well, what do I know?

487.08 501.92 speaker1  uncle
499.56 597.64 speaker2  So maybe they're all Jimmy. Oh, I've got a Jimmy to Renamed Dave who didn't exist in the first place. Welcome to 84 So they'd weren't ever in the house all at the same time. I don't think oh 18 years of like fresh kids definitely seems like some kind of forced labor program or like
594.00 638.92 speaker1  If your uncle fucked your grandpa then you'd get another mom Grandma, cuz if you fuck your dad you get a mom Invented by Who's who is that guy

645.52 672.60 speaker1  Who's the guy that figured that out his name was something he was like a monk or a priest or something
669.32 737.50 speaker2  Yeah, he just went by Gregory when he was doing science Holly Coleman leak Peaky Blinders. Yeah, I'll be sure
733.30 765.98 speaker3  By the only two people you've been able to trust and contention thus far This is an arched Very Ninja Turtles arched roof above you with a pathway on the right pathway on the left and then sewage sludge
758.42 808.62 speaker1  I'm on my back and I've got my left hand that has the watch on it and I've got both my feet on my arm just trying to like pry the watch off my wrist and I
806.82 855.54 speaker2  Yeah, we're sure Why? Why did you do that? I? Think things will set us off at the drop of a hat these days. It seems like yeah, maybe I'm gonna have to shoot you but if you fucking just
849.70 875.26 speaker1  Okay, well maybe you can you walk in front me and Clark can walk behind you just to make me feel better
870.90 893.34 speaker2  He's got you know, it's a tense situation. Somebody's got to diffuse it a little bit So I've livened things up get get get a little get a little joy in our heart after you beat that old woman half to death fucking psychopath
890.74 918.26 speaker1  Didn't I didn't want to do it. I didn't mean to but Let's just get let's just get to the fucking pond Good it's probably cuz I'm the Savior and I just have that kind of intuition now
916.26 973.40 speaker2  You nailed it Yes Maybe from one point of view from a certain perspective because of Kevin's slobiness Or perhaps ill ill got it. Sorry Murphy's going crazy. So good. Gotta stop him
970.84 1023.44 speaker3  You can hear Tyler from back the way you came yelping out To not get gonorrhea
1021.44 1051.32 speaker1  So I think
1046.92 1099.64 speaker2  He and my my my saintly mother were trying to have a baby and could not conceive I obviously didn't go to according to plan but we tried and there was a crowd around there that saw us trying to help I think John you might have scared him off with a couple gunshots, but they saw that we were helping I She told us seems like Adam Kane and the town's version of things right now is that we let them die and then left town
1098.72 1109.46 speaker1  accident
1106.60 1131.72 speaker2  guys, I tried my hardest to keep it from happening, but
1128.56 1145.62 speaker1  Creatures before I mean Marvin things I I mean like I told you guys before I got this watch stuck on me that I Saw three of them at least when I was a kid
1139.68 1201.92 speaker2  In my in my yard before before my dad gave this watch to my brother in my memory It was a they were chasing the I I would say a rogue figure but these days it's the road figure I think it's the same one. We've been seeing it might be old me Forwarded by old me. He put chains around the library door That's where I was in the library and he put chains around the door and then took maybe he took the heat off of Mary
1198.24 1228.40 speaker3  On the front it says the Mary Cole Public Library
1224.96 1246.36 speaker1  How all this is just all the shits happened so fast I don't know what I don't know what to think about any of it
1242.72 1267.92 speaker2  on us, I don't know I mean and then these things were chasing us and
1262.12 1285.36 speaker1  Do you think you know, maybe she knows more about this than she lets on or oh
1281.40 1346.02 speaker2  It's either not the Maggie that we knew or it's it is a Maggie We knew and she maybe hurt the one that we didn't know or I don't know. I don't know what's going on now Spider on your keyboard. I've never heard of that one before
1342.10 1367.86 speaker1  Us but it is me. So sure. I'll bet my three dollars
1363.82 1383.42 speaker2  It's not gonna feel too bad when you both, you know have given me six dollars That'll
1378.18 1417.46 speaker1  I don't know what time of day it is, but I think I see the light up there if it is daytime
1410.38 1473.66 speaker3  a little bit behind because as you're saying like let's race keeping it just like took off and started sprinting and you chase after him And right when you're about to take the lead from him He trips over his own feet and lands face-first In the sewage just off to the left of the right side of this path That was confusing and lands face-first in the sewage in this little Small pathway that goes down the middle of this tunnel that you're in That is coming in from a drain a storm drain. You're the it now and
1471.86 1523.78 speaker1  green and brown Goo and I open my eyes and like you can just see my eyes are the only thing that aren't just covered in that color and Grab Clark's hand
1521.78 1580.86 speaker3  for how vile this is Wretching right now and the other two of you you're gonna take a negative 20 on all rolls until you can Figure out a way to alleviate this situation. So your abs are just like overkill working themselves because of how
1574.02 1617.66 speaker1  Backside of it that's not like covered in stuff and try to like wipe my arms off a little bit and wipe my face Shoes are just soaked. So I go ahead and take my shoes and socks off to all right going barefoot
1613.02 1626.62 speaker3  That may be an issue if you need to step on stuff on spikes
1624.62 1661.32 speaker2  Didn't suspect my knife floor
1657.10 1683.74 speaker3  You see the neighborhood that surrounds beans pond You can't quite see into the pond where the water is from this angle, but you know exactly where you are guys
1680.26 1776.96 speaker1  Guys take a look. I think we're here and then I pull my phone out and So you don't have to you know, crawl through
1770.60 1816.50 speaker3  you can see that beans pond has been completely emptied of its contents and There's just this muddy basin there in the middle of this little like Neighborhood where these streets kind of cross and in the middle of this pond right next to a mostly buried metal door in the ground you see a Tank of fish to the brim just teeming and inside there is a gaunt little boy and he is Drowning and he is desperately trying to stay afloat
1816.06 1824.26 speaker2  Are we?
1822.26 1837.98 speaker3  the street across from you and Then the pond starts what like 10 yards past the other side of the street And so the middle of the pond is probably 15 yards past that
1832.54 1848.54 speaker2  So the middle where this is happening is about 25 yards away, okay, so yeah beans pond is not very big
1843.58 1900.78 speaker3  It's bigger at the top than it is at the bottom. Okay, and you can take your headphones off In the very middle of beans pond, which is now a muddy basin sans water sans fish Just mud and in the very center there is a mostly buried metal door in the ground and Standing there right next to it is Pastor Adam Kane Wearing an old motorcycle helmet that seems to have some weird tubes and you can kind of see that the red light is
1896.90 1919.62 speaker2  Lit on it John draws his gun and tells him to take the helmet off
1913.70 1971.14 speaker3  Disgusting refuse on to the side of the concrete as you drag your way out and it's kind of like building up you know as you pull yourself out and When you kind of stand up you see that across the street is beans pond, but there's no water There's no fish just as you expected But what you didn't really expect is to see you know in the very middle there's a mostly buried metal door in the ground and Sitting right next to it is an old motorcycle helmet
1968.02 2000.00 speaker2  Take it off now. What would help would help with John? There's like there's a kid who's floundering over there in that tank of fish right there. What do you talk?
1998.00 2102.52 speaker3  Joe Luke take your headphones off Motionless on the ground right next to the metal door that is mostly buried in the ground beans pond Rolled dexterity for me You can put your feet wide enough apart to kind of balance as you kind of slide down into where the bottom of the pond was and You run up to administer first aid You see a lot less Movement from inside only the fish are going crazy and you see the water begins turning red
2097.52 2130.66 speaker2  Following John I'm following John I think right and he run in in the same direction that I would want to be running
2128.66 2163.58 speaker3  explodes just this and Then he runs into the base and slides down the side and then Clark Bishop follows right behind him. I run after them You can see this mud. It just kind of looks like the refuse that is all over you
2156.50 2187.14 speaker1  Shirtless you have these giant. Oh nice. Okay, so I have 50 decks minus 20 is 30 and I rolled
2180.34 2244.34 speaker3  slips falls face forward into the mud and begins slowly sliding down the pond wall as the other two make their way into the very center and Immediately shots begin firing from either side of you You can feel yourself kind of sliding forward and then all of a sudden you feel a bullet Pierce into your ribs on your left side and you don't know whether it went all the way through but breathing becomes Extremely difficult as you take seven damage
2238.46 2254.46 speaker2  The tank that I see and try and put myself between it and one of the you said it was coming from both sides Right the shooters. Yep, put the tank between one and another shooter and try to return fire from where I think it's coming from
2252.46 2296.22 speaker3  search No, that'll play that'll play alertness would come in here because you're focused on doing something else and the shots are ringing out so you can kind of immediately see that there is a privacy fence and You see that there's a gun being held just like over the fence. That's just like firing. What do you do?
2290.46 2347.48 speaker2  I would be aiming for center mass if I could picture a person standing behind it through the fence. Okay, roll firearms. I Had already swapped that I might have just shot someone dear to me What if even he swapped drew out of Carrie Paige's body into his body and he's in Carrie Paige's bodies
2342.18 2362.42 speaker3  But shots began ringing out you can change what you were doing if you want or you can continue trying to do first aid
2360.42 2381.58 speaker2  When Shoot the person behind the fence or return fire in that direction I spin around the other direction and try to see where the other fire is coming from and I've got I've got both John's gun
2379.58 2420.90 speaker3  Man what a episode Title With your words and so it's your firing with both John's gun Neither one hits as your oh as you're trying to figure out where it came from where you fuck. Sorry You know, I just looking without you're just looking you cannot figure out where this these shots are coming from from the other side
2418.98 2438.10 speaker1  I'm Zach. You can ask me a question at any time
2433.02 2459.34 speaker3  Unfortunately, we didn't make that a thing which seems like it should have been it's probably doesn't matter
2453.50 2471.78 speaker1  the mud out of both my nostrils and then I shove my finger up my nose and
2465.58 2489.02 speaker3  Improvement is for doing that it has varied. Yeah, it was willpower based, but we weren't we're not really
2483.18 2490.54 speaker1  And I just want to sprint back up the wall of the not pool
2489.54 2496.86 speaker2  Absolutely
2494.26 2512.14 speaker1  Is that where Clark is shooting at?
2507.02 2525.60 speaker3  So John was shooting up in the air, but he was looking left. I'm gonna draw a quick map real quick Keith you got hit from the left side, which is the side that
2523.60 2540.04 speaker1  wall of the pond and So that at that point I'll be on my right look over to the right and do I see any anybody or any?
2535.16 2573.46 speaker3  Dexterity or athletics to get back up without slipping at a negative 20 still fail So as you're trying to slide back up, you're kind of looking off to the right But you can't get your grip on this mud for long enough to be able to keep your head straight especially with this deep pain coming in your side and shots begin firing off once more as One of the bullets flies right by your ear and the other ones are all hitting the mud right next to Keith Vigna
2569.90 2632.90 speaker2  Clark Bishop, it's your turn is the person behind the fence still shooting Yes, I'm gonna shoot again. I want them to stop shooting Specifically wasn't Drew's voice, please. No
2629.42 2657.38 speaker3  There's no privacy fence on this backyard and on their deck There's a little propane grill and there's someone hiding right behind it and they keep poking up and firing
2655.38 2672.86 speaker2  Will you give me the 30?
2669.82 2681.70 speaker1  Pond again, and yeah, you'll be able to make it out on this turn I want to look over and can I see the guy too or do I need to roll a check?
2681.18 2929.20 speaker3  No Now the John has shot him and he's kind of shown himself both people have been shot and you guys kind of know where they At least were last round at the beginning that's just Covering you at this point and you fire and you hit this dude as he's like laying on the ground John hit him He kind of fell over and you fire you hit him right in the torso and he kind of rolls over and he's facing you and you see at this point Asher little who is one of the parents of Aiden and Alice little who went missing a couple days ago and you see that he has Laser faded jeans that are bedazzled and he's wearing a long-sleeve shirt that is skin tight to his Crossfit body and the front of the shirt has a picture of his children Aiden and Alice who are twin nine-year-olds and he is wearing a fair amount of makeup and he is rocking some Yeezys and he is crying out in pain and You don't know if he's gonna be able to get back up, but he is not Yeah, he was driving that longs to the littles and you recognize the two of them from driving it and they are members of the first Church of contention and now the first Aimlessly hitting the mud around you But instead of moving to fire up into the air. He just fires directly at Keith Vigna and he hits him There's seven more damage. Oh he hits you in the hip and you feel it hit the bone and You think it might have cracked as you begin like limping? Real crunch, you know, you you don't feel good. It's pain You've been shot twice once in the ribs once in the hip and you're still standing. So yeah fucking helps Clark Bishop, there is no tank here There are no fish here and John Lee Pettymore the body that is right next to you not there the only thing the two of you see on the ground is Is this metal door that is mostly buried Looks completely sealed and it says here lies the beans scientists beyond measure
2926.12 2940.34 speaker2  Like that's the only thing I could find cover if I could get that door open
2936.76 2972.96 speaker3  There's no handle on this door. There's no hinges on this door It almost doesn't even look like a door other than the fact that that's how I've described it so far
2968.68 3003.82 speaker2  Podcast as we go and I just generously let Zach edit that out. I Hope he doesn't accidentally leave this one in this time
3001.82 3022.06 speaker3  Whatsoever in front of you roll sanity
3016.98 3072.94 speaker2  Curling his fingers like a super when he heard that Joe had rolled over his power But now he's gonna stand up like nothing could hurt him and charge the person behind the fence Shooting the whole way as he runs so we'll go 52 on a 60 nice roll a d10
3066.18 3200.00 speaker3  You see a woman who is wearing a skin tight t-shirt that has two children's faces wasn't going to What just happened skin tight t-shirt, oh, that's all that it takes for you And you hit what is very likely in your mind Avery little and she falls backward and You just hear this moaning. How about that? Do you like that Thomas? 16 well d10 for damage to mmm This little back deck that he's on but his eyes are wide open and his aim is still Directed at Keith vigna who is slowly trudging toward him and Keith vigna It is your turn and it is likely an important one
3194.20 3248.96 speaker2  Farcically disappeared these children, you know a very a very light-hearted Goofy There would be these kind of consequences angry citizenry angry parents I just want to say admire here
3246.96 3278.36 speaker1  Like
3276.36 3406.16 speaker2  Hey Tell you to roll firearms She can't argue with that, right Saying I could be like, well, it's not as bad as what's act
3403.10 3478.14 speaker1  I like have Asher in my sights But I just noticed the propane tank that's right next to him under the grill. I aim a little bit left Fire a couple rounds the propane tank explodes and I say soy beans puto
3476.14 3680.04 speaker3  grill explodes throwing the body of Asher little through the backsliding glass door of this home as it glass shatters and Your eyes are set at the bottom of the pond but above that Clark Bishop is walking up the other side and Makes his way to the fence and as you're trying to look through where you've been shooting through the fence and these holes that you've made The person you've been aiming at seems to have crawled out of view. What do you do? No no, and there's times like these where retribution is the only necessary thing in the eyes of those who are light in the Lord and To pervade the evil of this world We must desecrate the bodies of those who are succumbing to the pleasures of this earth She'd readied in action with a successful firearms check and she fires Directly through the hole at you and rolled a nine For Damage So you go down to 15 quick math. That's uh, you do that's 11 yeah, I would be not that you go down to 17 and First math best math hard to say
3677.68 3695.80 speaker2  Ashers to ashers dust to dust
3691.36 3719.00 speaker1  And I'm like guys did you hear what I said, did you hear what I said when I shot it I
3716.60 3730.68 speaker2  But I never I'm there was never a helmet guys
3728.16 3748.04 speaker1  72 so over my power and
3746.04 3761.24 speaker4  I
3753.88 3821.96 speaker3  I will tell you what your option of a mania will be from the table 10 from Call of Cthulhu 7th edition called Rith arith mania obsessive preoccupation with numbers
3815.64 3859.84 speaker1  Did did you guys take my picture too? Did you did you take that photo and I have to start searching my pockets? it's in my back pocket and I look at it and I like
3857.84 3990.22 speaker3  power And you each feel a loosening of some external forces grip on your perception And the scene, you know and a single blink has changed completely beans pond is encircled entirely by the Six-story tall wall of water and the three of you on the inside of the foul-smelling floating moat Clark and John this unnatural feat of nonsense is right behind you and you can see ice forming on the water always broken immediately by one of the many fish hopping out sideways and plopping back in with the force of this horizontal gravity Keith begins running down into the muddy basin to see the engraving on this impassable metal plate careful not to slip and fall face first in the mud again But across the pond on the other bank is a whole situation holds a pistol to the back of Carrie Paige's head who is Blindfolded and on her knees and right next to them is Pastor Adam Cain Wearing the strange-looking motorcycle helmet red light lit and he is driving the four-wheeler About to drop into this former pond and he's aiming straight for Keith Strapped to the back of the four-wheeler you found an a-plus storage crashed in the woods and had drew fix up all nice Strapped in behind Big Daddy Cain is the radio with the odd glass tubes and its green light is lit And sitting atop this unnatural radio claws holding on for dear life is an extremely determined black cat Yeah
