0.00 149.04 speaker0  Garbage in the morning, garbage in the evening, garbage at suppertime. When garbage is on a bagel, you can eat garbage anytime. Welcome my trash bags, it's your dumpster diving daddy, Wolf the dog, and we are broadcasting live from 694.2 PTBP. And I am here to eat y'all, because that's just what I do. Feast on dumpster meats. Heck, it ain't even gotta have meat in it for me to chow down. You ever had a waffle that's been soaking in that sinful syrup that collects in the bottom of an industrial trash compactor? Five star yelp review every time, baby. Speaking of hot syrupy trash, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Anissa, aka ripsawunderdashunicorn, who tweeted about this show and tagged at Pretendin' Pod. They write, Dear Wolf, The other day I drove by a steakhouse and saw a crow dipping the french fry in the dumpster juices. Keep on kickin' ass. Ah, yes, the finest gourmands, my flyin' rat friends. Fried roots dipped in a dumpster au jus. I'll have what he's havin'. I also love the bloomin' onion, which is just when an onion has been sittin' around for way too long and gets real nasty. Talk about pretending to be people on the internet. We'll keep your secret over at patreon.com slash pretendin' pod.
142.52 169.32 speaker1  When fake cops in city blues with a few screws loose choose to snooze on clues, I can both amuse and accuse. It's the news.
162.84 233.30 speaker0  Instead, they read a few screenshots that were saved on the desktop and called it good. Too busy textin' the same person from two different phones.
229.10 246.94 speaker2  Do you have no one in your family, no cousin, like, who's younger than you or something? Or you could be like, yeah, bukkake, this is what I'm-
244.10 254.94 speaker0  If they know what it is, they'll know how to not see it.
252.94 256.94 speaker3  Oh, fuck.
254.94 261.94 speaker2  Jesus Christ.
256.94 264.94 speaker3  So in fact, they grew up in a bad area, so yes.
261.94 271.94 speaker2  Are you the youngest, like, youngest period?
269.94 299.94 speaker3  What did you say when your sister said, Luke, what is bukkake?
296.94 316.94 speaker2  Well, good thing my sister doesn't listen to this shit. But we can say hello to Luke's dad, who is up to episode 14 as of recording.
314.94 322.94 speaker3  Well said. Which I thought should be canon.
318.94 325.94 speaker2  Yeah, absolutely. But if you make it this far, welcome-
323.94 356.94 speaker3  To the lab! Also, I make some extra money on the side, so it's kind of win-win. Gotta buy a lot of towels. Because people cum on my face. Okay, yeah, there it is.
354.94 370.94 speaker2  And they pay you for that, seemingly.
369.94 371.94 speaker3  Kevin can wait.
370.94 385.94 speaker2  Leah Remini? I got the joke, it was good. Thank you.
383.94 392.94 speaker3  I know, people, and it- It feels like deliberately I know what's going on. Let's take that again.
389.94 406.94 speaker2  No, no, no, it feels deliberately humiliating when Zach was like, And I feel bad, over the past week, obviously, I've felt pretty bad about doing that. So this time, I'm just going to say- That you made it all up and no one knows what's going on?
405.94 413.94 speaker3  I know that you- I know you just make it up.
409.94 417.94 speaker2  No, those people who came into the studio last week, they weren't real.
416.94 423.94 speaker3  Wait, what?
420.94 427.94 speaker2  He was like, hey, if you give me $50, I'll give you $200 in three weeks.
425.94 435.94 speaker3  Oh, those people. There was that one guy that talked like an old man, but he didn't look that old? There you go, you got me.
434.94 438.94 speaker2  Right.
437.94 440.94 speaker3  How did you play him?
438.94 462.94 speaker2  What do you mean, how did I play him? Did you call him acting like his son and say, hey, I'm in prison. I need you to wire me money. Oh, my God. That's exactly what I did. That happened to my grandma. That happened to my grandma. I was sitting in high school. What?
461.94 464.94 speaker3  This is not a joke.
462.94 480.94 speaker2  This is actually a solid story. I'm sitting in high school English class and my cell phone is ringing incessantly and I'm like, what the fuck? I keep looking. It's my dad. The third phone call, I looked at my teacher and I was like, hey, my dad's calling. My grandma probably died.
479.94 481.94 speaker3  Yes.
480.94 508.94 speaker2  Because you just sucked in high school. I'm like, I'm at school. And he's like, don't lie to me, Zach. Where are you? I'm in English class. I can put you on the phone with my teacher if you want. And I'm like, I was a good kid. My parents trusted me. Where were you actually though? I was in English class.
505.94 514.94 speaker3  and drinking with a homeless person. Arrestees.
512.94 528.94 speaker2  that my grandma got a phone call from someone who sounded enough like me to trick her into almost wiring $1,000 as my bail. And he called me thinking that I was in jail.
527.94 529.94 speaker3  Would they give me my cell phone?
528.94 537.94 speaker2  I was a senior in high school. The same thing happened to my grandma. Tell the same story. Well, it's a little different. Different enough to be interesting.
535.94 544.94 speaker3  That's what's important, baby. I was traveling.
541.94 551.94 speaker2  house-sitting for a relative. My grandma vaguely knew that I was traveling. But she got a call from somebody who was just like,
549.94 565.94 speaker3  hello, grandma?
564.94 571.94 speaker2  to talk about it. She called me. Weird enough to talk about. Yeah, she knew it was weird enough to talk about.
569.94 574.94 speaker3  She was like, if I saw something,
572.94 614.94 speaker2  And she did. Thankfully, my grandma wasn't scammed. But now I know every time I talk to my grandma on the phone now, I'm like, grandma, it's me. I say my middle name, which is embarrassing. And also vagina. No relation. No relation. Have we said our last names? Probably. Yeah. Okay, I'm Thomas Cox and I'm proud of you. So outside of me saying that you guys are dumb.
613.94 631.94 speaker3  No, no, no. And her name is, what is her full name?
630.94 633.94 speaker2  Yeah, but that's it.
631.94 643.94 speaker3  Also, if you give me her phone number, I need to give her a call. Thomas Vagina Cox.
642.94 646.94 speaker4  Thomas Vagina Cox.
645.94 647.94 speaker3  A lot of relation.
646.94 669.94 speaker2  You're my grandma. Don't treat her like some kind of ignorant. How do we recover from that?
668.94 674.94 speaker3  My God.
673.94 688.94 speaker4  Yeah. like a serial killer.
687.94 706.94 speaker3  Oh, how many? I start poking holes in my theories. You floated one. So I don't think, but yeah,
703.94 716.94 speaker4  that maybe people killing themselves is their goal. Like us offing people is maybe- Counter productive. That it's helping them achieve whatever goal that they're trying to.
714.94 732.94 speaker3  I think, I don't know if it was on the podcast or just in conversation with you, but talking about how when, because like when people chant in most like Delta green things, it's typically something bad.
730.94 736.94 speaker2  as broadly as possible, Zach.
734.94 766.94 speaker3  Tawil Alakol. Yeah, Zach. 40 on a 70, I shoot you in the face. But no, I was saying like, usually I hear a chant like that and I'm like, okay, if something's about to be summoned, it's gonna hurt us, it's gonna be bad. Let's stop it. But so far when the chanting has happened, it's just been people killing themselves.
764.94 779.94 speaker4  is that we haven't actually killed either one. We've heard two, right? We've heard the guy in the mall, the Santa mall, and then we've heard your brother's partner, Bruce Robin. We killed Santa, right?
777.94 785.94 speaker3  and then everybody else that we didn't kill started killing themselves. Enchanting. Enchanting, yeah.
783.94 787.94 speaker2  Everyone in that room was chanting.
786.94 794.94 speaker4  Enchantment, yes they did.
791.94 799.94 speaker3  and I think we shot him and beat him up and then he killed himself.
798.94 803.94 speaker4  He punched him. Somebody shot him in the gut. I shot him in the gut. Oh, did you really?
802.94 807.94 speaker3  One of us did. Somebody did.
806.94 808.94 speaker4  He killed himself.
807.94 835.94 speaker3  In the heat of the moment, who knows who shot who in the gut. But yeah, so my theory now is maybe next time it starts happening, could it be some sort of protection spell that's like, I don't think it's a bad thing. I think my initial thought is, oh, it's gonna summon an elder god demon thing, but I don't think that's the case anymore.
833.94 852.94 speaker4  the path we were kind of heading down just now was that when you do the taui ala coal, that if you kill yourself then, it then spreads, right? In that kind of way we just stumbled on as we were talking. Or if you're killed maybe.
848.94 859.94 speaker3  we blacked out, woke up naked writing numbers in blood. And who's to say that we weren't chanting that while we did it? Because we don't know.
857.94 865.94 speaker2  I don't remember doing that.
862.94 873.94 speaker4  did they start then doing numbers also or were they just chanting? They were just chanting at the end,
872.94 878.94 speaker2  throughout the process.
876.94 891.94 speaker3  onto the ground with paint. And he was naked. throughout the entire campus of CSU, numbers everywhere written all over everything.
890.94 900.94 speaker2  That's a good question. As we all look at Justin.
899.94 907.94 speaker0  well, Zach told me.
906.94 918.94 speaker3  Donovan West Haven. Haven. He uses Roman numerals, not Arabic numerals. And so he's not affected. That doesn't sound right.
917.94 921.94 speaker2  Numerals? Donovan, yeah.
920.94 925.94 speaker3  Numbers? Well, but people are.
924.94 941.94 speaker2  Roman numbers? Yeah. They're Roman numbers? Roman numbers.
939.94 945.94 speaker3  No, we can't. Luke is like, oh yeah, right, right.
944.94 950.94 speaker2  Roman numbers.
949.94 951.94 speaker4  I'm like, fuck you.
950.94 966.94 speaker3  No, I didn't. All right. What else? Any other theories of what the hell? Because you guys are so stupid. What else? Any other theories of what the hell could be possibly going on?
961.94 972.94 speaker4  The other theory that we've been kind of operating under is that it transfers like in a chain-like fashion.
968.94 984.94 speaker3  I think I said this last episode was my initial thought was, you know, Harriet Marks died and then Bruce Robin is saying her name and then Bruce Robin dies and we're saying numbers that translate to his name.
983.94 987.94 speaker4  Do we know that?
984.94 1012.94 speaker3  I don't think we have, we haven't looked into it. I don't think we've looked into it, but I also, I couldn't tell you the first step in doing that. And the name Bruce Robin was writing was? Harriet Marks. But then Leon. Santa guy, right?
1010.94 1015.94 speaker2  He wasn't one of the like hot Santas.
1014.94 1030.94 speaker3  Yes. That was, uh, started chanting tall will Alec Cole or whatever. Yeah, there we go. Oh, right.
1029.94 1039.94 speaker2  and Bruce Robin? Right.
1038.94 1063.94 speaker3  on it. Investigate the most corrupt. The first is research research, most unethical corporation in the city in the city to was who is the overseer?
1060.94 1069.94 speaker2  She was more of a pro union activist.
1068.94 1076.94 speaker4  into it. She, she stumbled upon something that the overseer. So she was like, I got to research what this is.
1074.94 1104.94 speaker3  First is research. The most unethical corporation in the city, which is, I assume surprisingly not unethical. What is it? B and R or what was bar Corp bar Corp. I was thinking beans and Robin, but you got it. Bar Corp beans and Robin.
1103.94 1110.94 speaker2  I think. I don't know if she got killed. She killed herself.
1109.94 1116.94 speaker3  Okay. Which is a common theme of this whole thing.
1111.94 1124.94 speaker4  So could she have, uh, she didn't, we found out she like fell out of a fell out of her dorm window. Was that it?
1121.94 1133.94 speaker2  by Leon Simpson of the crime scene. There was a blood splatter behind on her a wall of her dorm.
1131.94 1154.94 speaker3  So she, she killed herself by shooting herself. Bruce Robin shot himself. I mean, I don't know if that was, if there's a link there. I don't know if there's a link there or if it just is circumstantial that they both shot themselves.
1152.94 1157.94 speaker2  Of Harriet Marks?
1154.94 1168.94 speaker3  We, we looked at, yeah, we, we looked at the crime scene photos. Bruce did, you mean? What would that imply? I don't know.
1167.94 1172.94 speaker4  Tell me.
1171.94 1192.94 speaker2  Yeah. I think we've covered a lot here and we've got a lot of good things being brought to the forefront.
1188.94 1198.94 speaker3  If you are one of the people that supposedly know what's going on, hit me up. Hit me up. Tell me what's going on. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
1197.94 1233.94 speaker2  Okay. around, Clark was looking at his phones and you would all know that the things that you have not looked at that you've come across since this epidemic has ended are the two videos on the laptop that Amelia Locke was throwing in the air. Fuck you guys. I got it right that time. Did you? There are two videos that I honestly don't know. Did you? I think you did for the first time. Think about it.
1232.94 1239.94 speaker3  Really get in your head about it. What would you like to do? I want to go to the lab.
1237.94 1244.94 speaker2  Wanting that, John head stores the lab. Donovan, we're going to the lab.
1243.94 1250.94 speaker3  Can you lead the way?
1249.94 1270.94 speaker0  with a lot of confidence.
1267.94 1280.94 speaker2  that he walked down and then he heads back towards you. Each petal has a different number written on it. I was going to ask if it had a number on it. And he hands it to you.
1279.94 1283.94 speaker0  It's cheap. Is it?
1281.94 1313.94 speaker2  What are the numbers? You have nothing. Fuck you. I said, I said my news resolution.
1310.94 1323.94 speaker3  We there's people that have been in there for days. Let's go. John puts the flower in your ear and walks.
1322.94 1325.94 speaker4  How are you holding it up?
1324.94 1326.94 speaker2  It's open?
1325.94 1333.94 speaker4  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's open.
1331.94 1371.94 speaker2  Okay, cool. When you guys go out into the campus, you hear these screams and noises that you've heard previously all throughout the campus. Come on. Shamwell Chameleon is on top of the minion.
1369.94 1382.94 speaker3  The minion was on top of the bell tower? Uh-huh, yeah.
1376.94 1405.94 speaker2  And she's just up there and you can hear her in the distance screaming, I gotta get higher. Higher. Higher. into the city. Those are probably there for her because it went viral that she wanted to get higher.
1404.94 1407.94 speaker4  Okay.
1406.94 1424.94 speaker2  Okay. Donovan, there are two routes to get to the lab. One is more direct, but it is not lit and the other one is- Is totally fucking awesome.
1423.94 1444.94 speaker3  No, yeah.
1440.94 1464.94 speaker0  endangered now, especially after seeing the one person be like, turn the lights off.
1461.94 1471.94 speaker4  one and just stare up at it for a minute or two. That's pretty pedestrian.
1467.94 1513.94 speaker3  Keith comes up next to you and looks up and I'm like, remember Harry Potter? That thing? Anyway. De-luminator? De-luminator. That thing's awful. Good thing we don't have one because I would have clicked it a bunch of times.
1509.94 1531.94 speaker2  And as you guys are walking in that direction, it's getting louder and louder and you can kind of hear that it's coming from this bench that is just around a corner. You can only see the edge of the bench. You can't see the fullness of the bench. corner.
1530.94 1535.94 speaker3  But you can't see it. What do you mean we can't tell what kind of bench it is?
1533.94 1542.94 speaker2  No, I mean the bench is like hidden. You can see the corner of a bench but you can't see the full bench because you haven't gotten that far yet.
1541.94 1545.94 speaker3  Is it around?
1544.94 1549.94 speaker4  She sweeps.
1547.94 1560.94 speaker3  No, there's just a building on the way. I prod Donovan in the back. I'm like, okay, really hurry up.
1559.94 1571.94 speaker2  It's coming up hot.
1568.94 1587.94 speaker3  Do you really want to go check out that sound? Just go. Just keep going straight.
1585.94 1594.94 speaker4  I push Donovan along.
1593.94 1597.94 speaker2  I'm pushing you through this.
1595.94 1616.94 speaker4  Don't make me go ahead. Sure, sure, Donovan. Of course. I guess if he nears the bench, he's going to say hello.
1608.94 1649.94 speaker2  is huddled into the corner of this enclave of this building and he's crouched over and he's got his left hand out and he's holding a citrus peeler in his other hand. And he's slowly dragging the peeler down each of his fingers and moaning as the skin comes off like a lime zest. Oh, fuck.
1645.94 1652.94 speaker4  So I had two sanity points and I rolled a one. So I've got one sanity. Okay.
1651.94 1665.94 speaker2  You're clinging on. I join him.
1663.94 1684.94 speaker4  I get up real close to him. He found a nice little spot here, it looks like.
1682.94 1694.94 speaker2  I pass 24 on 26.
1693.94 1696.94 speaker4  That sucked.
1695.94 1744.94 speaker2  Okay. Sounds good. I need you to leave the room. Get the fuck out of here. You're not welcome to hear this next part. Bye bye. Clark has disappeared to and then Keith Vigna immediately turns around and comes walking back and he is repeating the numbers for Bruce Robin. I grab Donovan by the chest, or by his shoulders, and I'm like, let him go. There's nothing you can do for him.
1743.94 1766.94 speaker4  Him. Okay, I wasn't going to do it. Don't. especially, you're not going to want to see what's going on over here. I just, uh, just put up the blinders and keep walking. Okay.
1765.94 1773.94 speaker0  Thank you.
1769.94 1795.94 speaker4  And I want to say to the man, why are you, why are you doing that? Oh yeah. Can I discern any words that I would know?
1786.94 1815.94 speaker2  Clark would see the numbers four, one, one, four, eight, five, one, one, eight, two, zero, written all around him.
1811.94 1832.94 speaker4  It's D A A D H E A A H B.
1831.94 1834.94 speaker3  Okay. We're not recording.
1833.94 1838.94 speaker2  Okay.
1837.94 1842.94 speaker4  Four, one, one, four.
1841.94 1849.94 speaker2  Eight, five. People like this.
1847.94 1863.94 speaker4  Eight, two, zero. Actually, I'm not talking to anybody. I figured out the numbers. D A N H E A R T. I want to say that name to him.
1861.94 1867.94 speaker1  Does that mean anything to you, sir?
1865.94 1877.94 speaker4  Oh yeah. No.
1876.94 1878.94 speaker2  Dan Hart was a coworker.
1877.94 1886.94 speaker4  Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
1885.24 1887.94 speaker2  off each finger as he does it.
1886.94 1889.94 speaker3  Is it dead skin?
1888.94 1909.94 speaker2  Damn it.
1907.94 1934.02 speaker1  Oh no time. Oh yeah.
1927.58 1940.42 speaker4  This is the first time I think that Clark has been, has witnessed one of the crew doing this. So he wants to turn around on Keith. Keith. Keith.
1939.42 1946.88 speaker2  Nothing. He's just mumbling these. I'm going to smack him. Doesn't even face him. John. Yeah.
1945.42 1961.42 speaker3  Like John moves to stop his hand as he goes to smack him. The traveler.
1960.42 1963.42 speaker2  I thought he was.
1961.42 2024.90 speaker4  I don't understand, John. I turned to Donovan, Donovan, is this, is this what we were like? Leon was on the floor, but yeah, you guys were just mumbling, mumbling numbers. You're unresponsive. Couple minutes maybe. All right, then I'm just going to have to hope that Keith snaps out of it in a couple minutes, I suppose. Yeah. Keith, just, just hold onto my shirt. Sure.
2018.82 2026.90 speaker2  You guys are approaching glass hall and Keith's eyes kind of stop glazing over. Keith.
2025.90 2049.30 speaker4  Are you, are you with us? It was those numbers again. They got you. What? Which numbers was he doing? You were doing Bruce Robin's numbers.
2045.86 2050.30 speaker3  Was I just saying them or what kind of stuff was I doing?
2049.30 2062.26 speaker4  Like you're in a trance. You're just saying the numbers and wouldn't respond to anything. And I slapped Keith and it didn't work.
2055.70 2069.58 speaker3  I rub my face and I think back to just minutes ago when I slapped his face, I'm like, I wouldn't have done the same thing.
2065.26 2089.46 speaker2  Have yourself a merry little Christmas. It is the start of Tyler.
2088.46 2096.90 speaker4  That's new.
2095.90 2135.94 speaker2  the entrance. There is a college student dude who's dressed in like athletic shorts and slides and a t-shirt even in all this snow or slides, the slip on slides are like the slip on sandals. And that guy is standing completely still in this pose with like his right fist up to his cheek and then his left hand like flat and up in the air.
2132.06 2159.78 speaker3  You're flexing on one side and the other side is a dab.
2150.74 2176.26 speaker2  And then, more importantly, there is a young boy in choir robes singing softly and methodically sticking syringes into this dude who's just standing there.
2175.26 2178.82 speaker4  You're off the podcast.
2177.82 2198.30 speaker2  Done. It's our podcast now. And it's fucking about just being friends and hanging out and being nice. So get the fuck out of here, Zach. That's just a thing. He's gaslighted you in the blue.
2197.30 2200.30 speaker4  Yes.
2199.30 2208.82 speaker2  Zach-a-ganda.
2206.62 2240.82 speaker3  This is just in the lobby of Glass Hall? This is right in front of the front door of Glass Hall? Yes. Outside. Outside. I'm imagining the look at me on the captain now, but instead of him pointing at his eyes, it's just two syringes sticking out of his eyeballs. You're welcome for that one. I like playing.
2237.10 2243.74 speaker2  but if you pass an intelligence check, you're going to have to roll sanity.
2242.74 2246.54 speaker4  Yay.
2245.54 2247.54 speaker3  Oh my God.
2246.54 2252.70 speaker4  What does that mean?
2249.54 2266.02 speaker2  I got a 66 and yeah, my intelligence is 75. Hell yeah. So you guys auto fail your sanity checks for sure. My intelligence is not that high, but I... That is a failure.
2265.02 2270.58 speaker4  Oh really? I'm dumb and I'm 55. You're not.
2269.58 2272.58 speaker3  You're even lower.
2271.58 2275.58 speaker2  Well, you are.
2274.58 2289.66 speaker3  Come on. He is a fifth year senior though. The standards are higher.
2285.54 2292.18 speaker2  He like glanced up and was like, ah, it's probably fucked up and immediately went back
2289.66 2301.34 speaker4  to his phone, which is what Justin just did. Take a note.
2295.74 2310.06 speaker2  So with Luke and Thomas crit succeeding on those intelligence checks, we'll call that
2309.06 2338.70 speaker3  had to take. But what knowledge do we claim?
2336.22 2340.70 speaker2  Clark Bishop, Donovan West Haven.
2339.70 2342.70 speaker4  Nailed it. First try.
2341.70 2359.18 speaker2  So proud of you. The two of you notice as soon as this awful vision is approached. You see that Keith Vigna and John Lee Pattymore immediately go into themselves and begin chanting the numbers of Bruce Robin.
2358.18 2378.86 speaker4  What's happening? I don't understand. Has this always been happening to them lately? I think it's what's happening to everybody around here. I mean, you've seen people chanting numbers. I think I have some connection. For some reason, we're able to snap out of it appear. It appears and others aren't. I don't, I don't know. I don't either. I do little snappy fingers in front of Keith and John.
2377.86 2383.86 speaker0  Since I'm not there.
2379.86 2386.34 speaker4  Is there, is there an entrance into this building that isn't with these freakos in front of it?
2383.86 2388.34 speaker2  They are far enough away from the entrance that you could go around.
2387.34 2423.54 speaker4  That's exactly what I want to do. Donovan. I mean, I think we got to keep our eye on the prize. These guys are going to snap out of it soon. I got, we just have to wrangle up your three other friends that are all in a trance right Oh yeah. Oh yes. I don't know why he's not snapping out of it. I do. I, I go back to Leon again, do a couple of snaps in front of his face. Leon!
2422.06 2426.54 speaker2  He is just boogying on down. Can't stop, won't stop.
2425.54 2429.54 speaker4  I don't know. I don't know.
2428.54 2433.90 speaker0  I don't understand.
2431.50 2441.96 speaker4  I just don't understand what to do with that.
2439.82 2443.46 speaker0  I took it because I was always running late.
2441.96 2459.94 speaker4  Whatever it gives us to the lab sooner. before us and I think we need to just stay the course. Whatever you say, Clark, I'll follow you.
2456.74 2462.14 speaker2  to go around the side down an alleyway into the back?
2461.14 2465.78 speaker4  Yeah. I'm going, I'm beelining for the door with the lights on.
2464.78 2469.98 speaker0  I'll lead them to the side entrance.
2468.98 2478.58 speaker4  Donovan, over here. These, these here. These are the doors. I'm like, I'm slowly walking away.
2475.14 2503.88 speaker2  Yeah, I have the other three like dog leashes with me. this and there are stairs immediately in front of you that lead down and there's a sign that says biology lab in the basement.
2501.26 2516.74 speaker4  I pass a 27 on a 70.
2509.14 2537.56 speaker2  You guys both hear the slapping of feet coming around the corner and heading down a hallway toward you on your left side. Got to get. Oh yeah. And then, uh, and then that's where he just got and just like running while just like
2535.62 2544.22 speaker4  Clark is basking in the light. He's uh, arms outstretched, looking up at the fluorescent lights above him.
2542.50 2546.22 speaker1  Clark, what are you, what's going on? What are you doing?
2545.22 2560.90 speaker4  Just doesn't it feel good? What feels good? The light. It's fluorescent lighting. It feels bad. Just stretch them out. Just stretch them out, Donnie.
2557.86 2564.88 speaker0  Donovan like does like a weird, like very slight stretch.
2563.22 2591.46 speaker4  All right, where's his lab? Is it back down that way where the voices are?
2590.22 2608.98 speaker2  the opposite way. You notice John Lee Pettymore and Keith Vigna snap out of it.
2604.90 2622.50 speaker5  What's up everybody?
2617.54 2647.38 speaker2  Every time you're on mic, what you're saying is being recorded. We know that's not true. You come to- Because you leave so much gold on the floor. You're standing on the stairs of a building that you don't remember walking into and you look over and you see Donovan Westhaven and Clark Bishop staring at you. And right behind you is Leon Simpson, still just grooving and grinding and bumping and dapping.
2644.42 2660.26 speaker3  Are we on the inside of this building or-
2652.98 2667.58 speaker2  are covered in a trail of blood that is leading down into the basement and there are loose screwdrivers that have been spilled onto these stairs.
2666.58 2672.70 speaker3  Yes.
2671.70 2678.70 speaker2  No. I know. That's a joke. Oh, it was good.
2677.70 2689.46 speaker4  Welcome back, fellas. See the light in your eyes now. What? It happened again.
2682.70 2714.98 speaker3  I feel every time I wake up from something like that, I don't feel like I've lost anything but when I look at you and you've got this weird look on your face, I realize that- Did we gain anything from those intelligence rules? Nope. God damn it.
2712.70 2721.62 speaker2  So if you want to each roll a D4- Oh, cool. I wanted to roll.
2720.62 2724.62 speaker3  Me too. This is fucking crazy.
2723.62 2730.18 speaker2  All right.
2729.06 2735.54 speaker3  I'm at 19.
2732.94 2742.30 speaker4  You're the sane one here, man.
2739.30 2743.30 speaker2  You hit your last breaking point exactly so it's minus your power.
2742.30 2752.46 speaker3  Yeah. There's no more breaking points for me. All right. I tried to write on this soft desk and instead of a nine, I just ripped the paper.
2750.94 2799.86 speaker2  So give me a sec. small ugly child wearing a backpack that is cleaning the baseboards with the veracity of the veracity? What's veracity? Veracity is truthfulness. Veracity is speed. Oh yeah. No. the shit out of these baseboards.
2795.22 2804.86 speaker3  I pull my gun out and shoot him. I do not do that.
2802.86 2813.10 speaker2  I don't do that. I'm at four. But the trail of blood moves past this child and into the floor below that you cannot see
2812.10 2830.28 speaker3  yet. I look at Clark. Do you know what this blood is from?
2829.28 2831.28 speaker4  Can we tell?
2830.28 2850.72 speaker2  Yeah. It is moving toward. It's moving from the stairs the way that the blood is tripping and the way that the blood is like slid. Are there any footprints? It's being slid.
2849.08 2852.72 speaker3  Do I even need to roll?
2851.72 2855.72 speaker4  I failed. A 58 on a 50.
2854.72 2858.72 speaker3  Is that a 50? I got a 20.
2857.72 2879.28 speaker2  Okay. John Lee Pettymore would know that the blood is a person's body that was army crawling. Away from there or down the stairs?
2876.84 2893.52 speaker4  Where's that lab? It's down here. It's just to the right. We're almost there. Clark, I'm scared.
2891.76 2898.72 speaker3  my shoes a little bit.
2893.52 3014.88 speaker2  And I slip, and I fall, and I just slide down the rest of the stairs. D100 three times for me, and tell me the three numbers that you roll. take over your entire personality, who you are, and everything goals-wise, what your character is oriented towards. Number 6 is agromania, the intense desire to be in open spaces. 52 is habromania, an abnormal tendency to create pleasant delusions in spite of reality. And 74 is onomamania, which is an obsession with names, people, places, things. in spite of reality. As you're walking down the stairs, you slip and you fall to the bottom. You see that there is just a trail of money from where you fell further into the basement level, and there's just a pile of cash sitting there.
3012.88 3053.42 speaker3  know at this point, big britches. Yo, huge. Once I get up to the pile of money, I am standing there and I'm just handfuls of cash, shoving them into my pockets. Fantastic. I'm going to get the other boys.
3046.48 3086.98 speaker2  their way down the stairs, you see Keith Vigna slips, falls, and at the bottom of the stairs, he lands in this pile of blood and loose screwdrivers, and he begins grabbing these screwdrivers and putting them in his pockets, and then he's like grabbing up some of the blood, putting
3084.66 3103.30 speaker3  And then I continue shoving.
3095.66 3116.42 speaker2  bloody pile of an elderly woman's body that has screwdrivers just jutting out of it all over the place, and Keith Vigna is grabbing these screwdrivers and pulling them out of this lady and putting them in his giant britches.
3115.42 3125.82 speaker4  Are you kidding? Keith, stop picking us up!
3124.82 3137.22 speaker1  We're rich! We're rich! Yeah! Oh my god!
3136.22 3139.74 speaker2  It's impermanent. Keith, you're-
3138.74 3178.86 speaker3  I'm just a fool. I don't, this was my job, but I don't need one anymore. It wasn't, but yeah, now it is, yes.
3177.86 3181.86 speaker2  I passed mine. Okay, cool. As is tradition.
3180.86 3188.30 speaker4  Good for you.
3183.86 3198.18 speaker2  Okay, so Clark, you're gonna lose your last Sanity.
3197.18 3208.42 speaker3  No, fuck you.
3207.42 3253.10 speaker2  2020. Yeah, you are, baby. You do run the shit. You do immediately start chanting numbers, however. Those aren't numbers. They might as well represent numbers, right? Joe, if you would like to fully lose your Sanity.
3249.14 3264.46 speaker3  like I'm shooting a finger gun and I...
3261.26 3280.42 speaker2  Real cocaine, out of Keith Vigna's finger. And in that exact moment, Clark Bishop's eyes go blank and he begins chanting,
3278.90 3281.42 speaker3  He's feeling it. He's feeling it. How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?
