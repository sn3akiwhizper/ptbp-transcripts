0.00 73.76 speaker0  Welcome one and all, it is your only good boy radio DJ Wolf the Dog, and I'm hoping y'all give me some of them good pets for giving you that good news. Remember to keep those radios tuned to 694.2 PTBP if you want to give Wolf the Dog the emotional support he needs to keep on going and trudging through the eternal hellscape that is news and contention. But as we all know, time is an illusion my babies. But what isn't an illusion is my favorite segment, Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener named James W. who emailed us at pretendingpaw.gmail.com. Seems they were able to find some audio that is addressed to the police department here in contention.
71.24 144.16 speaker1  I'm the mayor of Texas. I just wanted to say I've been listening to your radio program and I wanted to extend my help to some boys out there who are doing some good in the world. If you ever need anything, I could give you a place to hide. Got an underground bunker system out here. Ted Cruz is currently hiding in there from some vigilante justice groups, mostly coming after him for that beard he's growing, but you know, also being the zodiac killer and whatnot. But anyways, come on down if you need help. I could maybe even pardon you for your crimes and such if you need it. Just remember you got a friend out here in Texas. Bye!
137.48 237.36 speaker0  This week we have a special presentation here on 694.2 PTBP, Condensions newest and only radio station. We are going to broadcast a recap episode with listener Q&A from a podcast called Pretending to be People. They have asked me to point out that their show is serialized and there will be spoilers in this discussion. So head on back to episode one, when I was but a wee baby my babies. But first and always, it's kudzu with no backbone. It's kudzu with no backbone. in no backbone. In no backbone.
231.40 284.96 speaker1  I am sitting in this room with Thomas, Luke, Joe, and Justin. For the first time all five of us are in the same room. And today we are releasing a special presentation. Thank you so much Wolf for having us on your program. We are here to release a Q&A episode from questions that we've received from listeners. And the reason that we are doing this, one, obviously to connect with the community. You guys are growing out there and we really like interacting with all of you. Very excited about what's in store for the show. And we are here to release this Q&A episode as a sort of thank you.
283.96 300.36 speaker2  A taste. Yeah, a taste of what you're going to get on the Patreon, extra content. But we were kind of blown away by the response we've gotten so far to this podcast.
296.04 306.28 speaker1  It's made me just so rock fucking hard. I can't explain to you guys.
302.42 335.32 speaker2  It's really difficult to be around Zach now because of his raging erections. I've had to get new hats.
334.32 345.64 speaker1  That is the goal. We are trying to raise money for new hats for my giant fucking head.
343.48 347.64 speaker2  you about the podcast. It's not a complaint.
346.64 370.80 speaker1  It just happens. Luke will take pictures with you for sure if you see him out. For five dollars.
369.80 374.42 speaker2  Patreon. We'll figure it out.
371.80 398.88 speaker1  Yes, we are launching a Patreon. This is honestly, to be completely frank, it is to keep the show going. That's true. I and we spend so much time working on this show to give you guys the quality content that we think that you deserve.
394.28 410.16 speaker2  His editing, his attention to detail, all the work he puts into this makes it the podcast you love. So not to get too NPR on you guys, but we need to make it a job for him. It needs to...
406.76 420.44 speaker1  He puts many, many hours into it.
419.20 430.74 speaker2  It's a joy. game.
429.74 459.44 speaker1  I really enjoy it. I want to keep doing it. I want to make this campaign something special. We've run some really fun campaigns in the past with this group, and I really think that this one can take the cake and really we can make some memorable moments. But it takes a lot of time. It does. It does. We would really appreciate you guys supporting us and check it out. We'll put a link in the episode notes. I can't believe I just said that.
458.44 472.72 speaker2  All right. Well... We're like a real podcast now. All right.
468.84 495.68 speaker1  I was certainly blown away by the amount of questions that we received. Absolutely. With that being said, let's start with a question from D. Tratara on Instagram. You know, just some listener I've never met. What a weirdo. Yep.
492.52 506.76 speaker2  I wouldn't have liked to stand next to him at your wedding.
501.28 510.48 speaker1  artificial, therefore making one's identity changeable and plural? Now, I did...
509.48 531.16 speaker2  Yeah. Go for it.
526.08 567.26 speaker1  As individuals present themselves across different social media platforms, they are able to construct various versions of themselves, i.e. bringing to the mainstream postmodern ideas, such as Simultaneously, the technologies that allow for us to enact ourselves in cyberspace also allow for greater monitoring of our activity. Thus, the projection of ourselves that we voluntarily put out across these sites can be aggregated into a quote data double of ourselves, providing those with technological means to collect such data and a complete picture of who we are.
566.26 605.06 speaker2  This... Go ahead and answer that one. I would say, yeah. We're very bad cops in real life, too. anything up for it. Like we just brought what we have to the table and... Luke's character voice is pretty intense. His famous character voice. Oh, man, it's like he's in the room. Where's Luke?
602.58 618.54 speaker1  I'm Keith Vigna now. Will you ever do a character voice? If I get a new character?
614.30 624.58 speaker2  And it'll sound like this.
621.74 632.14 speaker1  Dakota also asked, what do we... We've got an...
631.14 645.18 speaker2  Absolutely. It's gotta be a video game thing, but I don't think I play those kind of video games.
640.90 654.26 speaker1  All right, well, he would love to know, or she would love to know, they would love to know how Zach prepares for scenario campaign and session. Luke, do you want to take this one?
653.26 656.30 speaker2  No, no.
654.26 672.62 speaker1  How does he approach making a new story? How far ahead does he plan? How much is fleshed out before they start playing? How much does he prepare between sessions and how much is improvisation?
671.10 677.22 speaker2  All I know is that he does a lot. We should ask Zach about this.
676.22 678.22 speaker1  Oh, wait, real quick, Joe.
677.22 679.22 speaker2  Joe, what do you think?
678.22 722.14 speaker1  What do you think? Hey, Justin, do you want to hop in on here real quick and what do you think? recording... You're a big boy. I am a big boy with big answers for big questions and my name's Zach. Big butch boy. Are you ready for this big butch boy to answer your big butch questions? I want to hear it.
721.14 737.80 speaker2  Okay. Oh, God. I'm working on my new character voice.
732.92 762.38 speaker1  something new and we had realized at the end of playing our last campaign that we wanted to record our next one for posterity's purposes. I began writing and I took inspiration from a lot of different things, but I knew that what we know is small town life. I feel like we consume a lot of content from that setting. We've watched Smallville. Exactly. We know.
760.42 767.86 speaker2  I'm from Ozark, Missouri.
762.38 837.10 speaker1  That's number two, is that we live in Missouri and I wanted to play a campaign in that setting. We'd never done that before. Delta Green is mostly a game where you're dealing in government agencies and really highfalutin stuff that is very redacted and you have to have a high clearance to get that information. I wanted to play with small town cops. I thought that would be really fun and it turns out- It was. With that being said, I began to build a plot. I knew that I wanted to mix in rules from Pulp Cthulhu with this campaign because I read the source book and it fucking blew me away. I was so into it from the very beginning, actually two years ago or maybe a year ago when it first came out, I, for my birthday, ran one of the scenarios from the back of Thomas and Justin were both there and we just drank too much. It was a birthday celebration but I think Justin and Thomas' characters ran off- To meet Ernest Timmingway. Because he owed- Oh, is it that one?
836.10 845.94 speaker2  Yeah. Oh, that was a good time. It was a good time. People were very upset. The hotel? I was too drunk to realize how- Yeah, I was there.
843.42 859.70 speaker0  Me and Zach, or me and Thomas got- You and I had a really great time.
855.32 880.56 speaker2  Of course it's to fuck around for 15 minutes each turn while we're really drunk. We were just being these assholes.
874.48 973.20 speaker1  from having all the different talents and the sanity losing skills that would arrive I started writing this campaign with the items. That's interesting. I really liked the rules for the different magical items, but I wanted to put it in a more delta green setting. I started with the items that were in the trunk and I built the story out from there. They are all independent of each other with their own motives. I changed their wants and needs and motives based on everything that happens with these three police officers. Basically I have a doc sheet where I have all the different characters listed and then I change how the actions of these boys affect them week to week to decide how the story They call them bangs, I think. Somebody calls them bangs, which are basically just things that you throw in into a scenario and you force your players to deal with them. So I've basically wrote out all these different characters and what they're going through and then I write bangs each week. So far in the story, obviously spoilers in this episode. If you haven't listened to any of the podcasts up to this point, then...
972.20 995.40 speaker2  Stop listening. Yeah, go back to episode one. I'll have Wolf the Dog do it. Nice. Yes. Oh shit.
992.76 998.40 speaker1  I think we still keep him in the basement, so... So spoilers. Right.
997.40 1000.40 speaker2  Where were we? You can't let him see the full moon.
999.40 1008.52 speaker1  An example of a bang. An example of a bang is the body of John Peters falling onto your car. So that was going to happen no matter what we do.
1007.52 1015.36 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah.
1009.84 1024.48 speaker1  It's like in storytelling it's like, would it be more realistic in this super unrealistic setting for that body to fall not on one of your cars? Probably, but it's a game and it's a story and it's way cooler if it falls on your fucking
1023.48 1027.28 speaker2  car. Oh, and that's not something I've ever even questioned as a player.
1026.28 1039.24 speaker1  Sure, yeah. Totally. So that is basically how I prepare. The scenario has seeds that I wrote two years ago, before the campaign started, probably two years ago.
1038.24 1043.20 speaker2  When do you think? What month of...
1040.24 1046.20 speaker1  Okay, so we started recording in December of 2017. 2017. Oh my god.
1045.20 1049.20 speaker2  Yeah, right? Yeah.
1048.20 1085.16 speaker1  It's been a while. So we started, yeah, recording in December of 2017, so I probably started writing this in October of 2017 and some of the things that I've written have not come up yet in the show. Wow. So I have a lot planned. I have a lot of moving parts that I deal with and that is how much is fleshed out before they start playing. So for each session I try to brush up on what the people around them in their area might be doing and then if they try to go somewhere that I'm not ready for, I throw a fucking
1083.68 1092.44 speaker2  Yeah, you... Really kept us away from that mill. Oh, did you want to go to the mill?
1090.64 1100.16 speaker1  Kept going to the mill and then it came up.
1097.04 1141.48 speaker2  to make the responsibilities pretty top priority. Just go to the mill. She's burning alive. Brian, care, we're going to the mill. like preparing for stuff, me and Joe and Thomas, you know, when we would be recording an episode, like we would go back through and like see what we'd done prior to recording that episode.
1139.84 1150.12 speaker0  That helps keep it all fresh in our mind.
1147.24 1165.84 speaker1  for times when they were the only one in the room.
1164.16 1186.86 speaker2  have an episode like this. We recorded this, like he said, we started in December, 2017. The episode you just heard was recorded in November or December, 2018. We did this all over the course of the year, so if there's ever any time where we don't know what's going on in the podcast, like you're like screaming at your microphone or
1185.86 1208.90 speaker1  not your mic. Oh, you're just making excuses now. Oh, okay, cool.
1206.70 1241.20 speaker2  I was just gone for a while. our own tracks and I was listening to myself once and I was like, well, that's a fucking meme from like October. Like that's bullshit. Stale. Stale. I'm like, that happened a little while ago. That was a while ago. Yeah.
1240.20 1244.96 speaker1  I still haven't seen mid nineties.
1243.20 1246.96 speaker2  Oh wait, no, the one I really need to see is eighth grade.
1245.96 1252.80 speaker1  And I haven't seen that one either.
1251.80 1263.00 speaker2  grade. Yeah. I have seen both of those.
1262.00 1291.24 speaker1  I'll field this one. We are playing Delta green mechanics except for we have abandoned the bonds mechanic and we have picked up the luck rules from pulp Cthulhu. We are going to add in some talents from pulp Cthulhu.
1289.24 1292.24 speaker2  That's exclusive to us too, listeners.
1291.24 1335.40 speaker1  Let's move on. We've got a question from crush 36 real quick. Shout out to crush 36. Awesome. Awesome fan. Thank you so much. Crush 36 created a subreddit for pretending to be people and it has freaked me out in a very good way. I once said when we first started recording, I think maybe the very first episode we were talking about goals of this podcast and we thought, I think that we would make it maybe 10 episodes in probably before we stopped. However, that didn't happen and someone made fan art and it was, I was about to say, we
1333.64 1339.64 speaker2  It was, it was pretty awesome. That was really awesome. Like a Mr Leahy meets Dale Gribble.
1338.64 1344.68 speaker1  Yeah, it was good. Oh my God. Yeah.
1343.68 1354.76 speaker2  Oh wow. Yeah. Very similar. I pictured him a little fatter. That was the only difference. I pictured him a little younger, but I really liked the image I saw. I was like, Oh shit.
1353.76 1361.16 speaker3  Perfect. That's exactly what I was picturing.
1356.76 1369.48 speaker1  Taylor said that she pictured Clark Bishop with hair, but I guess she did role play with
1364.60 1372.48 speaker2  Well, also I just pictured Clark Bishop as Kenneth from 30 Rock as Jack McRae.
1371.48 1374.48 speaker3  That's Drew. That's Drew.
1373.48 1376.48 speaker2  That's Drew.
1375.48 1378.48 speaker1  What's his name?
1377.48 1397.84 speaker2  Jack McBrayer. Yeah. Well, okay. So if, if, if Andy Richter had Jack McBrayer's personality, that's what I'm thinking of. Yeah. That is incredible. Yeah. It was when I, when I saw that on the subreddit, I was like, dope. We have fan art now. Like that's, that's fucking wild.
1396.84 1398.84 speaker1  it's heartwarming.
1397.84 1403.84 speaker2  It was extremely heartwarming. Yeah. Shout out to crush 36.
1402.84 1432.40 speaker1  Sorry. Crush 36 asks how far from the original storyline and vision have the boys wandered? Um, next one. Thanks for the question. The answer is a lot.
1428.16 1446.68 speaker2  Because I mean, obviously as players, that's something I really want to know. Okay. Here is the truth.
1442.80 1475.16 speaker1  and we got together, we had already been talking about characters and we'd already been talking about setting, but we were going to meet and record on mic, which I think we have recorded still us talking about what the characters were going to be, what the setting was going to be. We built the town. I had a list of different kinds of businesses that would exist in a small town and we went
1474.16 1504.24 speaker2  Was that okay. Uh, Oh God. This would be a more informed question if I could remember the name of the system. But do you know that, uh, that sci-fi RPG where everybody builds the world together. That's like the original one, right? The old school one. You can die during this is a pretty light one where everybody kind of roll some things and all the players help build the system. I was wondering if it was inspired by that at all.
1503.24 1520.40 speaker1  playing RPGs. I've been listening to a lot of different actual plays and I really took from them the idea of coming together for a session zero and world building.
1519.40 1525.72 speaker3  kind of built in.
1520.40 1541.04 speaker2  And it is awesome cause right now I'm looking at the map of contention hung up on the wall in the room that we're recording in. drawn out. Uh, it's, it's huge.
1540.04 1548.90 speaker1  Yeah. Cause the map was really important to me from the beginning. If you're playing in a small town, I thought it'd be really fun to see where everything is.
1547.90 1550.90 speaker2  Pages, clinkers.
1549.90 1593.38 speaker1  All these different places. And uh, thankfully we have Justin who plays Wolf the dog and does the soundtrack for pretending to be people real quick. Give it up for Justin. Somebody did ask the question, Oh, Brendan DePinto on Facebook asked, how long did it take to create the map? And so, I mean, I made the original sketch of the map, but recently a couple of weeks ago for those listening, but like two days ago for us, we posted the map of contention that Justin made.
1592.02 1623.26 speaker3  of it. as possible because I really like whenever he would post stuff and he'd be like, this is where this episode is taking place. But I also wanted it to be like higher quality and a little more character added into it. So it took me like six hours or so to make it something like that cause I was also trying to learn a program.
1622.26 1634.36 speaker2  So fucking cool.
1629.32 1664.24 speaker3  the wave aesthetic and like added that in and then just added these big, huge vampire chompers on top of it. It's incredible. It gets me going. And it was really fun to create little icons for all of these weird places and contention, kind of like a video game map almost is what I was thinking. And that's, that's exactly what it is. And it's like perfect.
1658.40 1751.08 speaker1  So right back to the major plot points that have gotten sacrificed. In that session zero, we were talking about the map and I was telling you guys about the piston junkyard because I knew that was going to be a place that we were going to go to pretty much right away. Speaking of bangs, very first bang in the whole show is a call from Julie Maxwell says there's a dead body in the piston junkyard. That's a bang. Boom. And so the story begins. During that session zero, I said, yeah, and there's a junkyard right here and it sits on an old mine. And I said, no, I have to write that. And I like that. all these different moving parts. So they basically interact with a fully working town in my mind.
1746.48 1779.32 speaker2  So that was a kind of improv out of the campaign. Has anything that major happened in the campaign? Well, yeah. big they are. But I'm saying it's no. That's plot points that we came up with organically, but like, have you... Not even a plot point, that's just a bit. But nothing you've planned has been super changed by our actions?
1778.32 1815.40 speaker1  in mind. I only have people and people who want things. And so the story isn't already written. You guys are the ones basically making that happen. So cool. I will say the most affected is every little thing that you mentioned about your characters. Every little detail goes into my little book about your backstories, which you've given me basically full realm to just go haywire on. Exactly. Which I heard that you found. And Thomas told me all about it.
1814.40 1818.40 speaker3  Thank you so much.
1817.40 1840.68 speaker2  Okay. Well. You were so complimentary of all of our feet. That's why I don't take my shoes off at Zach's house.
1839.68 1856.16 speaker1  What can I say?
1853.68 1915.20 speaker2  I don't want to waste too much of your time. We have good tires and good service at good prices. Come on down and see us if you feel that's appropriate. Quality ingredients, service with a smile, and unquestioning faith in our undying Lord, Jesus Christ. We cook our patties the old fashioned way, medium or above. It's all undefined gray area here at Burgatory. Time is running out to indulge in our monthly specials for May. We're celebrating Cinco de Mayo with our seven layer dip and the Holy Guacamole burger. Just wanted to let you know we're located just outside of contention on rural route six. If you pass the tiger sanctuary, you've gone too far. Thank you.
1909.48 1917.84 speaker1  And make sure to get the product that was featured in that last advertisement.
1916.64 1919.08 speaker2  I use it all the time.
1917.84 1920.08 speaker1  It's an extremely good product.
1919.08 1934.60 speaker2  I'm using it.
1930.36 1974.16 speaker1  We got a question from the Robert Shippey on Instagram.
1971.72 2018.68 speaker2  That guy was much more disruptive to the group. You really ran with it.
2011.88 2037.36 speaker1  You actually stood up in my kitchen in the dining room and you stood up and fully charade played out your interaction with a toilet and then I think perhaps masturbating to completion.
2034.52 2064.76 speaker2  He was a doctor for a cult and that's all you need to know. Keith is pretty tame. I like playing a character that is not all there.
2058.64 2080.80 speaker1  I remember specifically when we were coming up with character ideas, you had this giddy fucking look on your face and you came up to me and you're like, I'm playing an idiot.
2079.80 2087.52 speaker2  a down tattoo. Yeah, that is completely true.
2086.52 2099.84 speaker1  I was.
2097.56 2116.72 speaker2  453, top of my class.
2115.72 2143.44 speaker1  I like oomph. OMF dash on Reddit asks, did Zach offer up insane options selling coke, killing your brother, thinking the guys wouldn't do it? I love the fact that the guys are kept in the dark on these solo side missions. Second question. Oh no, sorry. Not second question. I love the fact that these guys are kept in the dark on these solo missions. It started over. I already did. Yeah, he had it.
2140.92 2153.20 speaker2  That's the whole thing over again. Look at me.
2152.20 2157.08 speaker3  I'm the captain now.
2156.08 2162.08 speaker2  again. Zach, do it.
2161.08 2170.48 speaker3  Do it better.
2167.28 2189.36 speaker2  just here flubbing these fucking pre-written questions?
2188.14 2222.20 speaker1  that's for sure. I didn't know that they would perhaps follow through with these things or whether they would help each other do them. Thomas, I certainly expected to at least ask for Keith Vigna's help to sell the cocaine perhaps, but I really didn't know. No, why would you? Because I don't think...
2220.56 2229.86 speaker2  Jon are friends, really.
2223.82 2236.96 speaker1  And also, now that I'm saying it out loud, he's the worst person you could bring in on
2231.58 2244.78 speaker2  But on this particular drug deal, he might have been a pretty interesting addition, which is, I guess, why you did that.
2242.74 2249.58 speaker1  was smart for you to just do it by yourself.
2248.22 2252.70 speaker2  To no doubt. And not 2.5.
2250.98 2267.78 speaker1  I certainly... That's wrong, right? Well, you brought Drew in, and he's probably... That would be four people. Vigna would have been there when the Duke came to sell cocaine.
2266.78 2270.38 speaker2  That would have been awesome. I should have asked Keith for help.
2268.78 2295.50 speaker1  Oh, well, yeah, because that was my brother. back to the podcast, or is that something you don't do to keep yourselves in the dark about the things you don't know? I mean, that's up to you guys to answer.
2290.18 2309.22 speaker3  permission to hear some of our solo mission stuff, because we were kind of far away from it in playtime.
2305.02 2319.02 speaker2  We were like, is it okay to listen to this?
2314.82 2339.06 speaker1  There were certain weeks where I'd say, don't listen to the dreams that other people are having, and then other weeks where I'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah. accused him of it, and you guys immediately bought into the idea at that point.
2335.42 2362.18 speaker2  I'm pretty sure no one had any clue that Jon was in on that. I think he denied that pretty well. Yeah. Well, yeah. Up until recording this, we didn't ... Recording anything else up until this right now, we During the recording.
2358.58 2371.58 speaker3  That's something Zach requested, but it's also, I find it a lot of fun to be in the dark about what you guys are doing. Oh, yeah. It is super fun as a player. It leads to a bunch of really great roleplay moments.
2366.90 2375.66 speaker2  That was like ... Now, I do know that Coke Deal and you guys know that- Well, that it was your brother doing the Coke Deal. Right.
2374.66 2381.66 speaker3  Yeah, exactly. That was a reveal. We were all excited. Yeah. It surprised us all. That one hit everyone.
2380.66 2399.22 speaker2  Yeah. That was cool. It was awesome to know that.
2394.30 2419.38 speaker1  As we move on forward, it's going to be just as closed as it was last time in the sense that while we're recording sessions, you guys won't be able to listen to each other's side parts. Within the context of the game, I think everyone's pretty well aware of the deaths of Keith Vigna and Clark Bishop and- With the look- What?
2418.38 2428.86 speaker3  What? What?
2421.86 2458.66 speaker1  And I mean, to be completely frank, John Lee Pettymore is in the den of Marvin Glasp, so do you think he's going to last super long? We'll see. However, I have made- I basically like all things with this story. I folded in what happens into the future, and so the fact that these guys have listened to certain things, I will make sure that story-wise, it makes sense that their characters know them, if that makes sense.
2453.54 2468.06 speaker2  The only thing you specifically expressed regret about is that we listen to some of Clark's recent things.
2461.94 2483.94 speaker1  Clark being inducted into the circle of knowledge is something that Thomas and Luke now know, but the characters they're playing do not, so that is one of the things that I am going to attempt to figure out a way to let their characters know while folding that into the
2480.38 2504.54 speaker2  If we're getting much closer to when we're actually recording, that'll be a lot easier to manage, it'll just be a matter of you'll be saying don't listen to their section this week. Yep, exactly. so that's weeks of stuff. I hope we're still good at role-playing.
2502.90 2512.78 speaker1  I've kind of lost interest in it, honestly.
2511.50 2515.14 speaker2  Weaving.
2512.78 2525.18 speaker1  What hardware and software do you guys use? We actually just upgraded our microphones.
2522.58 2532.66 speaker2  Should we say out loud what it is or should we wait for the sponsorship? No, until we know that they don't suck, and until they give us money, we shouldn't. No, let's tell them.
2530.18 2548.70 speaker1  So we're super excited about that. Hopefully it'll cut down on the editing time for me and also make the listening experience better for you.
2541.66 2566.22 speaker3  To answer the actual question, these are Samsung, not Samsung, Samsung Q2Us. Just for this episode.
2564.76 2605.02 speaker1  They were trash mics. And that's what I've got right now because I forgot mine in my house. Software-wise, we record into a Tascam Digital Porta Studio 2488 Neo that I have had in my home for four years that belongs to Justin's dad.
2603.70 2618.10 speaker3  What's he doing with it? He's not doing anything with it. What if I want a podcast?
2617.10 2626.30 speaker2  Justin Jr.? Shout out to Justin Jr. for letting us use his equipment.
2622.66 2661.82 speaker1  Justin's his dad's senior, and it's always been that way since birth. Yep. Recently, Joe turned me on to Acid Pro 7, is that what it's called?
2660.82 2664.82 speaker3  And then the program is pretty cool too. That makes a lot of sense. Wowee.
2663.82 2679.86 speaker2  Advanced.
2672.70 2691.54 speaker3  I also, when I record my Wolf the Dog parts, I use Reaper, which is really excellent and low priced if you want a pro quality digital audio workstation. And you're always on acid. Which really helps. I'm never not on acid.
2689.38 2701.58 speaker2  We're going to take this moment to shout out microdosing. Microdosing.
2696.54 2710.06 speaker3  That humble bundle that did the acid pro, they've done that twice now, and both times it's been a ton of really great audio programs.
2706.78 2716.06 speaker2  And we have colored microphone covers. Mine's orange. Mine's red.
2715.06 2752.66 speaker1  Justin's is black. All right, and just another reminder that this episode is going to be our release for the Patreon that we are starting for this podcast to keep us going. So hop on there, we'll put a link up on all the social media sites. If you don't follow us on Instagram or Twitter, we're at PretendingPod on there. And like we said earlier, Crush 36, did I get that right? Yes, you did.
2748.16 2813.64 speaker2  And in case you need to know the details of the Patreon, what we're going to do is donate one individual donation at the highest level of the NPR donation level. And then we're going to share the benefits with everyone who subscribes to our Patreon. So $5 gets you the max NPR subscriber benefits. We still have to talk to Terry about that. Otherwise Luke gave $1,000 to NPR for nothing. Which that's fine. It was a... A mug? Some socks. It was a... Do you have a sock pun? It's Calamari Shapiro. It's an actual NPR joke. I actually have those socks. Those are things you actually have, not a...
2812.64 2824.34 speaker1  Okay. BF Evans 19 asks, do you approach playing a recorded session differently than when you play off mic?
2822.42 2846.30 speaker3  particularly interesting? And I noticed as soon as we all put on headphones, we became more respectful of each other's storytelling process. That's a great point. We didn't jump on each other's trains of thought as much.
2843.94 2886.98 speaker2  as we would if it was not being recorded. And I still notice when we edit our tracks that we do it a lot. It happens, but... The thought process behind it is very similar though. I just try to not be an asshole and not always succeed, but try not to be an asshole to my fellow players. I think that's as far as it goes.
2884.02 2895.86 speaker3  Yeah, the bare bones of it are no, there's no difference. We're all joking with each other and pushing each other to do funny things.
2891.06 2904.14 speaker2  I mean, the reason we did this is that we thought we're great. You should hear it.
2901.46 2911.06 speaker3  on in those sessions we didn't record. We super enjoyed it. We all mixed together.
2906.18 2921.74 speaker2  And it was the first group, I think, with all of us that we were like, I want to play with this group as long as I possibly can.
2914.02 2929.02 speaker1  Speaking of which, we also had BFEvans19 ask, what are your backgrounds in tabletop gaming? Which I think we covered a little bit at the very beginning of episode one.
2927.58 2940.14 speaker2  That was a while ago. So something we might not have covered in that episode though, actually, is I think almost all of us come to tabletop gaming through podcasts.
2936.50 2944.14 speaker1  That's what made me want to play these kinds of games. Absolutely. Not me, honestly.
2943.14 2969.82 speaker3  Uh, definitely me. I was, uh, I got turned on to it all by Critical Role and I'm still a huge fan of theirs. Um, yeah, I saw them and decided that that was something I wanted to do. And then I mentioned this on the first episode, but Thomas kind of out of the blue, I don't think you knew that I was watching that. Just if I wanted to do a D&D game with some mutual friends. And yeah, it was just lucky, serendipitous heaven stance.
2966.42 2971.82 speaker2  And that was 2016? Kind of.
2970.82 2973.82 speaker3  Oh, I looked it up at the time.
2972.82 2982.58 speaker2  Yeah. Kind of when role playing was just, you know, it was becoming this very accepted deal, popular. We're not, we're not, uh, ostracized.
2981.58 2991.54 speaker1  Yeah.
2984.58 3042.78 speaker2  Well, I mean, like for me, I, I played, I said this in the first episode, but I played a D and D twice in high school, played it with a guy that was super serious with a group that was not serious. He did not invite us back to play with him. somebody, I'll jump in. But most people have like groups that are pretty set up and yeah, so I never really had the chance until I met, shout out to Alex, Alex, uh, he invited me to play with you guys. I think it was me, Alex, Taylor, Zach and Thomas at the time. Alex is the most handsome man we know he is. Wow. It wasn't about handsomeness.
3040.78 3056.50 speaker3  Me and Joe got fucking thrown under the bus. You ugly fucks. It was just about who's friends with Alex, not.
3052.62 3065.82 speaker1  find them on our Instagram at at pretending pot.
3064.82 3072.46 speaker3  Oh no.
3071.46 3075.46 speaker1  Bang. Uh, yeah.
3073.46 3087.30 speaker2  Anyway, invited by Alex to play with them. I played one session or one campaign, I guess with them. Uh, it was super fun. We did it again and then now we're doing it again.
3086.30 3139.46 speaker1  Yeah. Uh, Justin here actually once texted me at 11 PM on a weeknight and was like, Hey, you know that Delta green thing that I've been talking to you about? And I'm like, I'm super down if, if, if you'll have me. roleplayed, we played a shotgun scenario. Uh, our friend Sam ran us through it as the first handler I ever had. Shout out to Sam. Shout out to Sam. Got me into roleplaying. Uh, Justin invited me over. The two of us played agents and we played through the scenario, uh, last things last. That scenario is fucking awesome. And it completely got me kickstarted into this game.
3133.66 3178.26 speaker3  I, uh, I remember getting invited not by Sam actually, but by Tyler who was living with Sam at the time.
3177.26 3188.54 speaker1  He took his hand. They hyphenated it.
3186.16 3227.66 speaker3  into the idea, but I was kinda like, yeah, I don't know. It seems like it can seem impenetrable from the outside. Like like Luke said, people have these groups and you're like, I don't know if I'll fit in. I don't know what to do. It's like there's all these rules and rule books, but he made it really accessible and fun. And me and Zach had started hanging out and I was like, you're going to love this. and story stuff and all this other stuff and I just knew Zach would be hopefully super into it. And then that kind of started off a lot of this stuff, which is really interesting.
3224.88 3247.64 speaker2  other role playing systems.
3242.40 3256.92 speaker1  where we don't have to play on the tropes of normal storytelling because we don't, at the end of the day, have tons of control over where the story goes. I mean, we roll dice all the time. What do you mean, we?
3254.76 3257.92 speaker2  And that's the beautiful thing about all role playing.
3256.92 3282.92 speaker1  Yes. Joe rolled a critical success on a persuade and that's what kept her from literally just like murdering Keith right in front of you guys. Keith, say thank you. Thanks, Joe.
3279.32 3317.64 speaker2  Well, I'll think about that in the future. Everything could always turn out different. Like crit success. It's awesome. Absolutely. Crit fail. You have something in your mind that you want to do and it's not up to me or to Zach whether it happens. It's up to purely a dice roll.
3312.98 3349.18 speaker1  in the hospital after her drunk driving incident and I said, yeah, let me roll for it real It's so much people.
3348.18 3352.18 speaker2  Okay. Let's see. What's the next question?
3351.18 3364.98 speaker1  It's rude. It's rude. I got a question from Lil Sleepy on Instagram has an important question.
3363.98 3383.90 speaker3  Desperado.
3381.02 3389.54 speaker1  Thomas, what do you think Clark Bishop's favorite Eagle song is? Desperado.
3388.06 3412.50 speaker2  It's just a hunch. I think Keith Vigna's favorite Eagles song is Life's Been Good by Joe Walsh.
3410.90 3430.90 speaker3  So I was actually going to bring this up earlier. Somebody asked about how we craft our characters and for me, a lot of times it's trying to think about what music they would listen to and I did not do that for Clark, so I can't do it this easy. I never knew you'd do that for any character. I love that. It's a really cool approach. What do you think it would be though?
3429.90 3437.26 speaker2  I don't know. I'd have to think about it.
3431.90 3475.94 speaker3  My old character Dash was this ex-military guy and I dove deep into like Three Doors It would be something that would show up on an easy listening radio station. It would not be terribly good. The truth is that I bet Clark doesn't care about music much. I bet that's not part of his life and his recreation.
3474.94 3478.54 speaker1  It's like, what? What do you mean?
3476.94 3516.06 speaker2  I hear it when I hear it. So I really like that you think of what your character would listen to before you create Steve Earle song Copperhead Road. The very first line in that song is my name's John Lee Pettymore. I missed, I constantly over the recording of this got mistaken whether or not it should be John Lee Pettymore the third or the fourth, but canonically with the song, it should be
3515.06 3517.06 speaker1  All right.
3516.06 3534.82 speaker2  Well, from here on out. would love. Right. up. I can't believe you did that.
3533.82 3559.94 speaker3  Me either.
3558.14 3588.06 speaker2  in paradise, probably Keith's. And then I want to ask, what would Wolf the dog's favorite song be? I think I know what it is. It's kudzu. It's kudzu. Are you sure?
3580.98 3610.82 speaker3  I imagine Wolf the dog sits in a corner and just listens to a low hum and he just turns
3609.82 3616.74 speaker2  on us.
3615.74 3622.06 speaker3  Yeah.
3619.90 3627.18 speaker1  I'm going to use it as the theme song. And they said, no, please take one of our other songs.
3625.02 3633.62 speaker2  All this stuff is way more jazzy, funky.
3631.46 3637.86 speaker3  Little jazz trio named kudzu.
3636.86 3657.12 speaker2  They're great. They are amazing. One of the best bands out of a really great town for local music. Absolutely.
3650.96 3752.42 speaker1  So guys, thank you for listening to this Q&A episode. Basically this is our announcement for the Patreon that we're going to do to keep the show alive. We really want to keep the show alive. Yeah. We're really happy doing it. We really enjoy doing it and you know, if we don't make it, that's fine. We'll just keep recording and I'll send all the edits to the boys and we'll have a really within answering some of the questions. We did some spoilies and whatnot, but I am here today to finish this episode with a full recap of everything, maybe not quite everything, but everything that's happened in the show so far. Keith Vigno wears large pants. He wears suspenders as well as a belt. Drew has lots of gum showing like his top lip is receding. Dogs are howling in the old neighborhood. It's the chief's birthday. Clark got her a box of chocolates. John gives her two thirds full bottle of cheap bourbon. Keith Vigna didn't get the chief a birthday present. She did, however, receive a box with a single rose, a white hard hat and a black silk bow tie before leaving town. I'm so sorry.
3751.14 3755.72 speaker2  No, it's absolutely not.
3752.42 3782.54 speaker1  Julie Maxwell called in to report a dead body at the piston junkyard and then crashed your car driving drunk and was pronounced dead at the city hospital. The body found at the piston junkyard had a brand on the back reading, this is a fool. Councilwoman Carrie Page's dog is missing and she is pissed. Jimmy Sanders saw an oil spill while tripping on mushrooms. Mildred Mitchell, that old kooky pot head, saw a bright flash of light from across the street in John Peter's house. John Peters is missing. Herdy at a long...
3781.54 3786.54 speaker2  Herdy at a long... That's the one thing we didn't address.
3785.54 3796.50 speaker1  I completely forgot. I haven't listened to Night F Fiddle in so long, but that's my bad. It's just conscious, subconscious, weird thing. My bad. Sorry, I made it confusing. Just a plain ass name.
3795.50 3804.40 speaker2  John Peters is missing.
3798.26 3912.90 speaker1  Two people came to John Peters' house, packed a trunk into their white Toyota and took off. She wasn't there. They went to Klinker's, the bar run by Harry Klinker with a daycare in the back. When Keith was a child, he liked to cut up hot dogs on white bread. Julie Maxwell had a restraining order put out against Leo Piston back 15 years ago for killing her sister Ashley. John found the chief's blue notebook, but her red and yellow notebooks were missing. Some idiot at the city hospital fucked up and put Julie Maxwell in the morgue. She came to and started screaming. County said that the body from the junkyard had the organs of someone who died 200 years ago but the skin and hair of someone who died yesterday. Charles, a drunk man and friend of the missing John Peters, went to the police station to get answers before pulling a gun and running away upon hearing the sound of a car crash in the parking lot. Kathy Piston shot Keith Vigna in the foot. He snooped around her property until trying to stow away on her school bus full of homeless people. The crash in the police station parking lot was a stolen black SUV t-boning George Piston's She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge. Officer Clark Bishop then shot and killed Julie Maxwell. The two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before disappearing. Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters. Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that It said, I killed the chief's pops, John. Keith is in a wheelchair. The officers broke into John Peters' storage units and found lots of things. One thing they found was so smelly they decided not to open it until back at the station because they wanted the station to smell bad.
3910.10 3920.68 speaker2  They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul.
3917.62 4031.84 speaker1  sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body. John pocketed it. The officers went to the woods, found a patch of land that had been burned to the ground, realized they were being watched, freaked out, wrecked the four-wheeler, ran into trees, Then they went to Julie Maxwell's, wore her taxidermy, found a circled yellow pages ad for Dr. Marie Jacobs and a receipt from Forgotten Treasures, a local flea market. They went to Forgotten Treasures and found the camera Julie Maxwell purchased was from Mildred Mitchell's booth. They went to Mildred's house. She didn't know about the items recently sold at her booth. She assumes her granddaughter, Tildy B. Mitchell, was selling things at her booth. Tildy B. Mitchell came downstairs, freaked out when she saw cops, and ran into her room. But when Clark busted in, Tildy B. pointed the strange gun at him and then disappeared in a massive flash of light. They went to Forgotten Treasures and bullied the nice lady there until she put her own life in danger by telling the cops about the drunk man who threatened her. Upon leaving, the white Toyota they had been searching for peeled out onto the road after a short, dangerous pursuit. Keith Vigna gunned down Charles Donovan, John Lee Pettymore fired warning shots into the air as well as Clark's tires, and they found a bald man tied up in the trunk. Keith took the ambulance with the unconscious bald man to the clinic. Officers Bishop and Pettymore headed to the suburbs to chat with Dr. Marie Jacobs when they saw an unkempt man, who we now know as James the mill worker, frantically vacuuming his lawn. This ended in tragedy. But Clark, John, and James all made it out with their lives. Our brave and heroic contention police officer, Keith Vigna, was made unconscious by Billy Harrison, the man found tied up in the trunk of Charles Donovan, the drunk who threatened the woman at Forgotten Treasures, both of which told officers they were friends of John
4030.84 4039.96 speaker2  Peters.
4035.52 4964.90 speaker1  Officers Bishop and Pettymore found man-sized fecal matter in the litter box, and the doctor The talented and beloved contention police officer, Keith Vigna, found himself sans uniform, weapon, and cruiser at the clinic. He had to call his partners to pick him up. Meanwhile, officers Bishop and Pettymore detained Dr. Marie Jacobs and her blood-covered husband Doug Jacobs in a cell at the contention police department. Officer Vigna and the two other idiots busted into the deceased Charles' room at Hotel Motel, guns drawn in sans warrant. There they found a woman dressed similarly to her favorite TV character, the Fonz. The woman we now know as Rosemary whipped a knife out at Officer Vigna after these so-called peacekeepers pulled their guns out. The party had Rosemary pinned down until the brilliant Keith Vigna engaged her in hand-to-hand combat resulting in a hostage situation for the copper. Vigna, an officer of the law, proceeded to brag about killing her coworker, but the sweet-talkin' When the old, wiry lady made a run for it over the railing and into the parking lot, all three officers unloaded their weapons from the second-floor corridor, bringing her down before she could get into her vehicle. officer left in contention. The officers planned a sting operation to catch Billy Harrison, the stranger running about contention who's wearing an official police uniform. The sting operation was actually a good idea, but the FBI was watching and stepped in on the whole thing. Agents Kennedy and McKinley were in town looking for a black Nike bag with nothing in it. 4th at the police department. Drew was uncommonly not at his desk, replaced instead by a note telling them he went to the chief's house. Officers Bishop and Pettymore hauled off the undocumented loot to their individual residences while Keith went to the chief's house to check on Drew. Officers Bishop and Pettymore were soon called to the chief's house after it had exploded, and an unkempt man with a bullet hole in his head and his face in a pile of foot meat. the city since the night of December 1st. The County Coroner reports that during the investigation of an active crime scene, Officer John Lee Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved a possible murder weapon into the eye socket of the deceased Chief Maggie Cook, fumbling and digging around atrociously as the charred bones themselves began to crumble to no longer be a part of the situation. This is cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of a missing person, that missing person being John Peters. The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals. The names of the deceased are not yet being released. More importantly, however, the officers take a while to order breakfast, finally deciding The officers are also dealing with a situation where an Officer Bishop seems to be in more than one place at a time. He has no recollection of this. The FBI agents come in, use the Nike bag by dropping in a small silver sphere, making sure not to touch it, and then recruit the officers into some unknown organization by giving them a phone number and telling them to eliminate the threat and keep it all out of the news. dark. The doors were locked by a cloaked figure who began chasing after a tall man in a suit. That sadly was not the worst of it because Clark got back home only to find his reality shattering, eventually remembering the confession of the woman who killed his parents. report information about the Chief's disappearance. They learned the Chief arrived to her home accompanied by James the mill worker and another man who held them at gunpoint. The gunman was an all black and had a scar over his eye. Gary Daley saw this man because he was following Harold Dorsey, the writer from the city who took Drew to the Chief's home. The officers, always utilizing their time efficiently, spent a while asking Gary Daley a life of civic duty. They were chased by a couple of giant, gaunt, suited men that seemed to vanish when the pair of Pettymores came across John's nemesis, Large Eddie, roughing up Don's car in the parking lot. The altercation ended with a deliriously concussed John Lee Pettymore seeing his second cousin was hosting a lunch for anyone who needed it made by the pastor's wife and children helmet he bought from Mildred Mitchell's booth at Forgotten Treasures, and learned that he is working on legislation to allow motorcyclists to ride without helmets. preferred Keith's older brother Ferguson. While playing on their family sprawling estate, Keith and Ferguson heard the sirens blaring as strange, gaunt men in suits appeared to fall from the sky and were shot down by the Later that night, William Beans gave Ferguson a watch and told him about a prophecy that The light on the camera was green, so John took a picture of Keith outside the station. On the way to the mill on the other side of the city, John saw something strange in the sky causing a fiery three car wreck on the main longitudinal drag of contention. who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.

Drew apologized to the officers for not passing along critical information like calls about the officers the animals are hiding in the water because the oily substance cannot get them in the ponds and creeks. Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, and historical society member, also lover, revealed some interesting information to the officers about the picture from the odd camera John found in Julie Maxwell's car as well as about Cole's orphanage. In James the Millworker's house, they found a cache of guns hidden under the coffee table, a bunch of cleaning supplies and random materials, and a small enclave behind an oil painting of a rose, a few loose tiles in the kitchen where something buried has been dragged out, and a 12-foot deep pit under a trap door with two corpses and an officer Clark Bishop at the bottom. the robot man almost cut Officer Bishop's arm off to when the robot man froze at the command of Officer Pettymore to when the robot man's torso flew out the window, gripping the throat of Officer Vigna. Skyrockets in flight, baby. Thank beans he poked that Terminator top in the eye just in time to escape before the metal fella exploded like fireworks earlier in the evening. The officers then cleaned themselves up after fighting a large robot man with feelings, perhaps? Keith Vigna found a single piece of music called The Rise of the End in the bench of the stringless piano. Clark Bishop found in the flipped-over coffee table blueprints for Calm Comfy Campground, a suspiciously planned-out set of seven buildings, six encircling a large one in the center that sits on Lake Calm. A similar design was found drawn on a piece of paper in the pocket of one of the two corpses Sitting in James the Millworker's house, the officers remember that he died in Chief Maggie Cook's house with a bullet in his head, face down, and a plate of foot meat. They also remember the contents of the present that she received from an unknown source the night she took off, the red rose, the white hard hat, and the black silk bowtie, all of which were present in this home in a painting on a suit of armor and worn by a statue, respectively. After undressing the bottom half of the still-standing robot man, the gang finds a logo on the smooth pelvic area. It is an M made out of four double helices. They voted and decided to store the legs in Keith's cruiser trunk. some really plot-heavy shit went down. Keith Vigna was approached by his niece, Frances Beanes. John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews bonded over a shared fortune after a smooth transaction, and Clark Bishop saw an impossibility out of his own window and then woke up in an unfamiliar place with an unfamiliar face. Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother. He then murdered that woman and stole the watch that was passed down from William Beanes off of Fergie's corpse, then he laid in his bed at Hotel Motel. Officer John Lee Pettymore and Drew Andrews were being held hostage by Rosemary, who works for Marvin Glass, after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins. Clark Bishop was inducted into the Circle of Knowledge. There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past. Clark then headed back to contention in a cab from the mill on the other side of the city. The officers met back at the contention police station early in the morning of December 5th, along with Drew and their new partner in crime, Rosemary, an actual member of the Glass crime family. In the station, an FBI agent named Trent Chad was sorting through contention's paperwork. Clark shot him with a dart, and agent Trent Chad became very impressionable. With agent Trent Chad's newfound pliability, the officers worked out ways in order to convince the public as well as the feds that the local authorities have everything under control in contention. The officers found their cells holding Dr. Marie Jacobs and her cat man to be empty. Upon checking the security footage, they confirmed the black ooze slammed the two jailbirds into the ground of their cells before disappearing entirely. Keith blurted out that the camera will be ready to use at 1 p.m. They checked the evidence room and saw a single green light beaming from the old glass tube in the body of agent Trent Chad. Rosemary is driving separately. There is a severe lack of traffic and human life in contention. The town is loud, though, with plenty of animals filling up the ponds and creeks.

Harry says not really, but that he's been meeting with his group more often than usual. Harry clarifies that it's a group of spiritualists and metaphysics thinkers, including Gary, Dr. Marie Jacobs, and Mildred Mitchell. They call Gary daily, and Gary says he's hanging out with Mildred Mitchell. that she's having a bit of a breakdown. Gary describes the group as a... that she's having a bit of a breakdown. Gary describes the group as a sorcerer's guild. Gary says it's been years since they'd sorcered anything. Harry Potter fanfic. Jesus. She might have had something going on, and she had a lot of power. Clarke worries that this is all his fault, since he couldn't find her dog. Gary mentions that Mildred keeps staring at a picture that she thinks somehow changed. different than he did before. Gary thinks he looks the exact same. Mildred keeps saying he's not as attractive as he used to be, and now he's dumber looking? She also says that in a reflection and a piece of glass in the picture is Tildy B. Mitchell. Pettymore asks if Gary would describe his grandfather as a wizard. Gary explains further that Gary was always afraid to let them know, as he thought it might have some sort of reaction. Gary's grandfather gave him a book, and it had three pages left in it, and he was to When Gary did that, the words danced like magic on the page and came off like sparks. It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. It surrounded you guys in this light, and he did it because the three of them are the key to everything. Gary only knows that he'd done his part, and the rest was up to them. Gary's grandfather didn't tell him exactly what happened, but that, quote, fortune would There's an elevator door, and John Lee Pettymore, Keith Vigna, and Clark Bishop get into the elevator. The wall on the other side of the black onyx walled elevator opens into a dark room. The boys walk in, and the door behind them shuts.
