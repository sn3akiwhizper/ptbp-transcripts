1000.32 1018.60 speaker3  not dissatisfied and he notes the guy behind him he also he doesn't take the time to stop and smell the flowers but he does make an interested note of them but he just walks straight on to the to

1858.56 2059.36 speaker2  I'm also very very excited to have you on the show with an actual with an actual character at six o'clock on this island if the island was a clock face you were at six o'clock and leading in front of you is a cobblestone pathway up to a large hexagonal building that is both rustic and modern it's made mostly wood but there's big glass windows all over it and on either side of the cobblestone leading up to this building are these large flower beds filled with these gorgeous flowers that take over most of this island however on either side of the fire beds you see a bunch of so much flora no flauna you can see there's no desert there's no custardy desert there's not unfortunately maybe inside maybe inside so as you're walking up you see in the distance through these trees there's these cottages laid out at one o'clock three o'clock five o'clock seven o'clock nine o'clock and eleven o'clock on this island and through all this dense tree line and stuff you can still see these cottages they're tucked away and you notice with your keen investigative eyes so this is an automatic success because your alertness and your search I'm to your right as you're walking up to this large building you see down this long cobblestone pathway this cottage and on top of the roof of that cottage just far in the distance but with
2054.72 2073.92 speaker0  towards that way or would this be weird what I would I know not to you wouldn't know anything
2066.76 2143.84 speaker2  closer and closer you see this little girl take off running from behind cottage three and she's does not turn back and she continues to run toward the cottage and you see she goes around the back and brambles you make your way into a small clearing where this cottage is and it's really cute and there's a nice little front door and a window in front and windows on the sides and you see some movement through one of the side windows and you think it's basically the rough outline of
2138.64 2182.96 speaker0  do like some kind of like stealthy search maneuvers creep up to the window and be able to
2177.28 2234.72 speaker2  through this window you see that there is this young girl with pigtails and she is wearing overalls with a little striped shirt underneath overalls and she is sitting at the kitchen counter and eating a sandwich and then walking in from the other room is an average build man he looks to be in his late 30s but his eyes have aged and his hair his grade like someone who is in the war or went through some sort of traumatic experience he's wearing a white dress shirt gray slacks and black shoes and he walks over pours a glass of milk and slides it over to the girl who then
2228.00 2317.96 speaker0  like try to dip out at this point because it looks like that's probably her dad or something yeah I
2308.76 2521.32 speaker2  and then looking about 12 feet up the tree you see the small lens of a camera that's poking out there aren't any branches low enough and there's no like grips on this tree that are in the direct area to begin a climb so you can't even get off the ground I think I'll just leave it alone for large building you see that sign and there are two double doors on a porch a couple steps up to beautiful rustic and elegant lobby with a large wooden chandelier hanging above you to your right there is a young boy and to your left there is an old man and I'll bring Luke into the building cut out and we ran out of space on that hard drive perfectly timed because Luke and Justin you saw you see this kid on your right who is just incessantly ringing a bell that is on the
2515.56 2638.28 speaker0  boy hello nice to meet you and I'd like outreach the hand kind of awkwardly I don't know how to
2632.92 2701.20 speaker2  going back into some of your memories and not really paying attention then you snap out of it and you realize that oh shit I was I was gonna try to check in but at that moment the back door right behind the desk opens and a young man wearing cowboy boots blue jeans a plaid pearlsnap button down bolo tie and a white cowboy hat comes out of that door behind the desk and you can hear a guys must be the Grimes is that right yes okay absolutely so see Charles I've got number seven for you and he hands you a key with a big rubber keychain on it this is calm comfy campground and it's got a big number seven on it and then he looks at Walter and Alan and he's like and you

2736.20 2818.72 speaker2  would all please make your way into the meeting room right there for orientation and he points at large hexagonal building and inside we find a room that is circular the wall never ceasing and never creasing at any point even where the wall meets the ceiling and the floor the angles are rounded off there are six chairs and a half circle facing a single chair in front of them each chair has a bottle of water next to it and standing around this room or sitting in these build walks into the room he looks to be in his late 30s but his eyes have aged and his hair is grayed like someone who is in the war or has gone through some sort of traumatic experience he's about any war he might have fucked with the war there's a chance that he would have been in I saw you
