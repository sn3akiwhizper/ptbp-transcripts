0.00 102.30 speaker0  Happy Friday, babies! It's December 6th in PTBP time, but it's Friday time in yo' time. My producer wanted to let y'all know that we are on a Friday release schedule now. I'm sure it's so they can get up to all sorts of debauchery on the weekends without having to worry about producing this fine program, or something like that. I don't know, the producer never speaks to me anymore. They just kind of ominously glare at me while emitting white noise frequencies to frighten me. Last week was regrettable. I ate so much chowder that I vomited continuously for a week straight. I was empty, so very empty. My stomach became an endless void devoid of all hope and sustenance. Just more room for clam gravy. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Lady Betavir, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod. She writes, "'I was hoping that you could settle a debate "'I've been having with some of my friends. "'and not at all realistic discussion "'of whether it was impolite "'to decline food offered to you on a visit, "'particularly when your host was an elderly man "'who may or may not be involved in a grisly murder, "'and the food is a bladder "'of incredibly questionable cold cuts, "'olives, and warm baby vegetables.
100.20 114.46 speaker1  "'that it was better not to eat anything
112.20 122.68 speaker0  "'and the carrots have fingernails, "'so we could just not all agree.
119.38 132.62 speaker1  "'er, my good fishing buddy, Lord Bonk,
131.10 220.40 speaker0  "'like Welsh, maybe, "'and rolling his eyes into the back of his head, "'so I suspect he's not entirely sure either. "'on the proper behavior for this oddly specific "'and completely made-up scenario "'that certainly has not happened to any of us? "'Thanks from another loyal listener, Lady Bettevere. "'P.S., if you ever get a hold of anyone "'from the contention police department again, "'please give them our kind regards. "'We'd love to bring them "'but we haven't seen anyone at the station for two days, "'or six months. "'I'm actually not sure which it is, "'but we miss them all the same. "'Greetings, loyal listener Lady Bettevere. "'In this house, we always eat whatever is given to us, "'for the meat of man is still meat nonetheless, "'and all meat is good. "'And though you might vomit, worry not, children, "'as that is but a sign of respect in the House of Wolf. "'So I'm on Baby Brew's side, "'Also, drop them unquestionable cookies off at my address. "'Just smell around, I'm sure you'll find my abode. "'even your foe, to say hello to our fine audio.
218.38 227.68 speaker1  "'would blow Wolf to and fro,
224.64 294.86 speaker0  "'From high in the sky to low and slow, "'I'm on a booze cruise to soothe the news. "'On the last episode, holiday hijinks "'led Clark Bishop and Leon Simpson, "'along with their new friend, Donovan something, "'to the dorm room of Harriet Marks and Amelia Locke, "'where Keith had information and John had changed. "'In the room across the hall, "'the group banged out the melody of Jingle Bells, "'turned and saw the bell tower in the middle of the campus, "'dressed in lights, wreaths, "'and topped with a giant minion inflatable. "'Just a reminder that it is December 6th here in the city, "'so the whole holiday cheer thing is appropriate. "'Kazoo with no backbone.'"
292.00 300.10 speaker1  And we're back in the groove, boys."
297.70 356.06 speaker2  As you finish hammering out the tune to Jingle Bells on this Casio keyboard, you hear the bell tower in the center of campus ring out as well. You see through the window of this dorm room, the bell tower lights up in a congratulatory glow, That's just a John thing. I turn away from the camera and I kind of like I mean, we can assume that if this Alicia Locke, what was her name? Amelia. then we can only assume that she's got more information at least that we can talk to her.
355.04 365.50 speaker3  So I guess we need to. Yeah, I think she's probably the first one to get there. So let's finish these clues and go talk to her.
364.38 401.48 speaker2  Not the elevator, it sounds like. Yeah, probably not. As opposed to what? He says that and John like rapidly rolls on all fours, like out of the room. Yeah, he gets down and like, And he's like, roll sanity, Donovan.
398.52 404.28 speaker3  I'm thinking that body fucked him up a little bit.
401.48 408.70 speaker1  Yeah, no shit, Keith, what the fuck?
407.30 417.02 speaker3  maybe that happening to you. And away we go.
415.62 428.22 speaker2  I'm so sorry. I'm walking next to you. I was rolling to demonstrate how much more quickly
426.22 432.42 speaker1  Jesus Christ.
431.02 456.24 speaker2  rolling mentally maybe? You guys are walking to the bell tower, which is nearby on campus. And you pass many a holiday accoutrement on your way there. And the snow falling has made it a really delightful evening even though it is quite quiet on this campus,
453.60 467.70 speaker3  Other than that, it's quiet though. No, not until just now.
464.98 473.40 speaker1  When we were first entered that gifts hall,
470.74 484.34 speaker3  Donovan walked into a room, flipped on the light, and a real creepy little dude said,
482.30 486.70 speaker1  It scared us.
485.16 492.42 speaker3  We'll have to go back to that.
490.24 508.68 speaker1  so much as a shadowy entity. And I just wasn't done with it. I didn't really want to deal with that. were coming from people in dark rooms and it scared us. So we turned off the light real quick.
503.68 520.04 speaker3  but we'll get back to that, I guess. And I continue walking towards the bell tower.
515.22 566.66 speaker2  with a large gated entrance that is built into the rock and stone formation that is forming this quite small, cylindrical, phallic shape that it reaches into the night December sky. And the door has a gate right there. There's a gate on the door, there's a door on the gate. It's just a gate, it's not a door, and it's open. I walk on in. So this is a dark stairwell. It is open all the way up like a silo in the middle, to the very top. Thomas is just drawing circles in his notes. It's really horrifying.
565.84 567.50 speaker3  Keith Vigna's going first.
566.66 578.30 speaker2  I'm going to go first. And Keith Vigna, you about halfway up,
576.96 580.94 speaker3  You're not going to want to see this.
580.10 591.52 speaker1  Just trust me.
588.98 605.28 speaker3  but also like, okay, whatever.
604.26 611.72 speaker2  And it's dead.
608.76 616.92 speaker3  And I stand by the corpse to kind of guide them past it.
615.20 621.06 speaker2  I grab him by the shoulders.
619.20 643.04 speaker3  I'm not about you? It is as much here as it ever was. And it is not here. Like it always wasn't. There is water at the bottom of the ocean. Keith is like just- Pretty weirded out. All right, Clark, come on. Get past this and let's keep going.
642.20 653.56 speaker1  I go past. Okay. I'm keeping my eyes open. Okay. Okay. Nothing happens to me? Nope. Keith, I can look at the body, it seems like. Okay, good.
651.86 665.52 speaker2  You don't see any like blood or anything. It's just a face down body. So yeah, I mean, you could assume it's sleeping if you want to rationalize it that way, but you know based on the world that you've been living in
662.20 671.42 speaker1  for the past however many, you know, whatevers.
670.58 682.14 speaker3  Any on the body? Oh yeah, there's some on the body. Anything that we've seen before? Is it all-
679.48 721.06 speaker1  Hey Donovan, you might, Keith's warning here, you might want to shut them eyes. Donovan is staring directly at the body. and he just like steps over it. Who me? Yeah. Picks it up.
718.70 730.32 speaker3  I set up all kinds of jokes like these. I continue up the stairs.
727.06 736.24 speaker1  John, you set this up? Did you? Keith, did he ever leave your sight?
734.22 741.50 speaker3  I laugh as they try to understand. I don't know what's going on with him. I think he might've had a break.
740.62 746.70 speaker1  Holy shit. Let's keep going.
744.50 752.98 speaker2  you hear a voice that is mumbling.
748.54 759.20 speaker4  42 can't find it, you know? If we can't get higher from this perspective,
758.36 760.86 speaker3  Hello?
760.02 767.60 speaker4  Oh my goodness. Yes, peoples. Yes, come on over. Come on over to the top of the tower, please.
766.32 773.28 speaker3  Yeah, as you approach,
772.24 779.92 speaker2  early twenties. And she has two boobies.
779.08 789.62 speaker3  God damn it. No.
785.74 795.78 speaker2  She has two buns on the back of her head, on her hair. It's like grade A, grade A content. And uh.
794.42 810.92 speaker1  Subscribe to the Patreon. Oh, thank you.
810.08 815.40 speaker2  On the Luke cam.
812.64 819.88 speaker4  Would you guys please help me get to the top of the tower?
817.28 825.16 speaker2  and her eyes are wide and she's looking at all of you like,
823.16 834.82 speaker4  I can't take you to the top of the tower, that'd be, that would just be fucking tits.
833.54 878.92 speaker2  Everyone pull out your headphones and then cover your ears real quick. Hey Thomas, when John closes his eyes, he just sees a mass of numbers flash before them. And then he sees the visage of Clark Bishop age rapidly and then age and reverse Benjamin Button style back down. And then you see your own face take over for his face, age in the same way and then age in reverse. As you open your eyes, she's still there. And she's like, I don't think it,
875.24 884.52 speaker4  Oh, my name is Sham Wow. That's unfortunate.
883.52 888.98 speaker2  Fucking millennials.
887.62 892.10 speaker3  What's at the top?
890.14 911.26 speaker4  I'm just trying to get higher, baby. Gotta take me higher.
910.26 925.88 speaker2  I don't wanna fall and die. his noise canceling headphones.
925.04 929.58 speaker3  up the rope to the bell? Are we at the top of the tower? Yes.
928.74 962.92 speaker4  There's lots of names. They're inside my brain and they keep coming out all over the place. And you would not believe the week ahead, but I guess like if I had to think about the ones that speak to me most truly, it would be 811-818-9520-1318-1119. but they're all over the place sideways and on top of each other. And it's just constant and it's all inside, but I gotta get higher.
962.10 963.76 speaker3  I'm pretty sure it was.
962.92 966.26 speaker4  Harriet. Oh, you know Harriet.
965.42 974.64 speaker3  I know Harriet. I know you. I know everyone on your campus. I know your mother, your father. That's wild.
973.48 978.72 speaker2  John, thanks for a minute.
977.12 982.88 speaker3  but yes, of course. Wow.
982.06 995.94 speaker4  Yeah, I mean, not too many people What do you need up there for? Number one, I gotta get higher.
994.56 1010.60 speaker2  Yes, for sure. But most importantly, gotta get higher than I am here. This is the highest spot I've been and the highest spot I can be, but I could get higher with you guys' help if you wanna help me get higher. Feel good.
1009.08 1015.96 speaker3  that would have led us here.
1014.28 1023.80 speaker2  and is like, take me higher. What are you looking for?
1022.96 1027.04 speaker3  Sure.
1024.62 1042.66 speaker2  Yeah, so looking out from the bell tower, you very clearly see across the way, there is a sleigh that is completely lit up in lights that is on top of a building across campus,
1037.90 1057.56 speaker3  which Donovan, you would know is the Accord Student Center. You think there's any connection? Donovan, what's that sleigh? That's the Accord Student Center.
1054.84 1067.92 speaker2  that points to a light up chimney.
1066.08 1082.44 speaker1  Are you telling me we did a scavenger hunt to be told that the jingle ball was at the student union?
1081.36 1091.20 speaker3  You think there's something to do that? Jingle balls, balls. I'm not convinced I'm ball.
1089.76 1092.52 speaker2  No, my child.
1091.20 1100.16 speaker4  Can you take me higher? You're all balls though? Would you just do the top of the thing? I'm sorry, you said that you all were balls.
1099.16 1103.28 speaker2  You'd like to be.
1102.44 1107.10 speaker4  as fast as possible.
1104.60 1117.30 speaker1  You can hear how he's been talking some gibberish. I just, he's just out of it right now. Well, persuade.
1116.46 1122.94 speaker2  You can roll persuade.
1121.66 1128.86 speaker3  I keep sending them though.
1126.86 1132.70 speaker2  That's fair.
1131.70 1162.92 speaker4  So if you could just take me to the very top of this bell tower, it's just right around. So you see how it's open right here? I think if you two of you stand right on the edge, you can hold my feet with your hands on your knees, with my sleek rock climbing abilities to get even on top of the tower even more. I'm kind of ignoring this person
1161.72 1175.98 speaker3  and then get over the ball. I'll see you there. I have a feeling she's gonna follow us and annoy us if we don't do this for her. Plus I just wanna see what happens.
1173.02 1185.74 speaker4  and that's who I wanna be. If you could take me to the Christmas sky, I could feel it with all of my might.
1182.06 1193.30 speaker3  I get down to like in the position she told us to get and I just kind of look over. I look over at Clark and kind of shrug my shoulders.
1191.86 1197.14 speaker1  They're gonna fall off that rope.
1195.82 1198.46 speaker3  and I shrug my shoulder.
1197.14 1215.64 speaker1  I have an idea. Clark, will you strike this woman down as you did the others? I'm not too bright, Clark, but I think it would solve all our problems if you struck this woman. It's like, well, that's true. I could just knock her out. John moves in front of her.
1214.64 1251.70 speaker3  If you're gonna knock her out, we might as well help her keep her dreams. and he's like, Clark. Is anybody gonna help me out here?
1250.86 1262.08 speaker1  that's a death sentence for her. It'd just knock her out though. That wouldn't kill her.
1260.08 1274.72 speaker4  No, no, you don't have to leave. Come on, God. You're gonna make me leave with your hand upon my skin?
1272.36 1324.22 speaker2  All right, so between the two of you, who has the better luck? I'll have you roll it. You help her out the little opening that's looking out onto the campus, and she is starting to climb up, clearly misses with one of her hands and begins to fall, but you catch her legs, and she immediately holds on with both and then fucking sends it, getting a full grip of the gargantuan inflatable minion that tops this CSU bell tower. You hear the swooshing of final coated nylon, and then... I'm higher!
1322.10 1346.08 speaker4  it's fun, four, five, six, seven, eight, kind of, you gotta get it up on the sky with the Christmas spirit, and my God fell into helping me aware
1342.60 1353.40 speaker2  Are we good now, is that, is it over?
1351.06 1361.56 speaker1  It's time to finally get my prize I deserve.
1359.40 1366.12 speaker3  The world works in mysterious ways.
1364.20 1370.56 speaker2  You see the security guard on your way back. Hey, Jerry. Same spot, but he'll hop over.
1368.68 1378.34 speaker3  And then at the bottom of the staircase,
1375.02 1392.86 speaker2  and you head over to the Accord Student Union that is just across the way. And as you walk up to it, you see that there are a couple different entrances. There are three in front of you. You can go left, center, or right. Are any of them lit?
1391.58 1395.74 speaker3  without waiting for discussion.
1394.86 1427.72 speaker1  I guess. Donovan, he's not always like this. In fact, it's a little worrisome. I just am trying to keep the eye on the prize right now and figure that out later, I guess. Yeah, seems smart.
1422.96 1464.24 speaker2  However, there is a path of colorful string lights on the ground, like a pathway or a road. You notice that there is a little sitting area to your left where there are some tables and chairs set up. And sitting in one of the chairs is a corpse that is quite fermented. It has been here for some time, you would guess, by the looks of it. And right next to that corpse is a very alive person dancing their ass off.
1463.32 1472.06 speaker3  Hey, where's the ball?
1468.04 1483.08 speaker2  and with their hips motions in the way that you're headed.
1481.68 1484.90 speaker1  That's not Tim Fate with.
1483.10 1494.22 speaker3  I dance with him for a little while.
1492.06 1669.88 speaker2  You would notice that the student union is- They have no idea. The path of colorful lights and thumping holiday base and a nicely dressed fifth year college student to a three story atrium, kind of like a small square shopping mall. But instead of Forever 21 and Orange Julius, there's a CSU merch shop and a subway. You're on the middle level, so looking down you see the basement of this atrium and it's decked out in jingle ball decorations. But in drastic contrast to this festive cheer, you are surrounded only by pure chaos, personified by obsessive college students and faculty. Across the atrium on your level, there's a girl shaving the fur off a team of reindeer in front of a photo backdrop and she is shaking and gluing the loose fur to her own skin. On the bottom level, a pair of very tall and muscular men in Santa outfits are diligently wrapping a college student in gift wrapping paper. They are using duct tape and force. An older woman in a bathrobe and one of those fur lined leather aviator hats that cover your ears is climbing a thick garland from this level up to the top. The garland wraps around these columns that encircle the opening to the atrium every 10 yards or so and they all meet in the center of the dome Hanging from the middle of this dome is a massive disco ball, 10 yards in diameter, wearing an equally huge Santa hat. Three people in elf costumes are in the corner of the lower level in a little ice skating rink with a life-size Frosty the Snowman figure. They keep putting the carrot in different places while laughing hysterically. A naked man is using a mop and a mop bucket full of paint to write out a sequence of numbers at the bottom of the stairs to the lower level. Across the room on the bottom floor, there is a young woman throwing a laptop in the air and trying to spin around in a circle before catching it. She is doing this fervently and she's wearing a shirt that says, gifts house on the back and best RA ever on the front. a dude doing squats on top of Santa Claus's throne stops and begins violently chanting,
1669.04 1674.12 speaker3  Roll.
1673.02 1680.62 speaker2  Roll persuade for me.
1675.66 1697.64 speaker3  Got a 76 on a, probably not higher than that. We're sitting in new places and it's hard for me to see my character sheet. No, that's a fail.
1696.28 1702.00 speaker1  Oh, you were, gotcha.
1699.88 1710.78 speaker3  and I like look at him and point it at the guy He must be punished.
1708.10 1716.54 speaker1  Towel alico, whatever, what's that? I've heard it before, but I, It sounds like a spell, right?
1714.42 1724.86 speaker3  That's what I'm thinking and I think we need to stop it. So far, I don't know. It could have done a number of things.
1724.02 1729.54 speaker1  We've heard it a lot. We've heard it a lot, right? I just don't remember what it does. I don't think it's done anything yet.
1727.84 1731.78 speaker3  Isn't it just the phrase?
1729.54 1734.66 speaker1  I punched your brother's partner when you started saying it.
1733.00 1737.06 speaker3  Yeah, so we've stopped everybody. It's done it so far.
1735.50 1739.44 speaker1  Yeah, maybe we have stopped it every time.
1737.16 1745.28 speaker3  Yeah, so I'm like looking at, Keith is looking at Clark ready to shoot this guy just,
1742.32 1748.40 speaker2  I don't know why I'm asking for permission this time, but.
1747.56 1777.18 speaker3  I fire. That's a two. So anyway, I started blasting. that's not shooting up a college. Fucking food court. They're monsters.
1776.34 1782.34 speaker2  A nine. Oh my God.
1781.34 1792.30 speaker3  Right in chest.
1788.06 1824.10 speaker2  he falls back into the throne of one Santa Claus and begins bleeding as he continues to slowly, quietly chant, Oh, and he succeeds on a constitution check and stays conscious, but fewer can hear his chant.
1823.26 1832.76 speaker1  Spotlight online.
1827.98 1856.44 speaker2  everyone in this room turns and looks at the five of you. Everyone then looks at the Santa throne where this man is bleeding all over while still chanting. Reindeer fur girl immediately turns and begins sharpening one of the horns on one of these live reindeer. The Santa twins. Wait, these are live reindeer? Oh yeah, baby. Oh shit.
1855.00 1865.56 speaker1  Yeah, I definitely thought he just more fucked up reindeer. Were they letting her shave them willingly or were they struggling again?
1863.36 1898.42 speaker2  They're tied up for a photo shoot and she's cutting off their fur with a blunt knife that she carries with her. Holy shit. Should have shot her first. The Santa twins, the two giant muscular men dressed as Santa Claus, start wrapping each other as opposed to this undergrad that they were wrapping before and they're using duct tape to wrap around the gift wrapping on each other. I wanted to ask about that guy who's being wrapped.
1896.68 1911.10 speaker1  or was he maybe fighting against them?
1906.98 1951.04 speaker2  and faster up this garland and is trying desperately to end like to the point to where she's like losing grip on the garland and still making it up. She's in very good shape. The three elves in the corner, they begin sitting on the ground and unlacing their ice skates. into his mop bucket and the girl throwing the laptop in the air begins throwing it way higher than she was before, so much higher. Like she's throwing this laptop 20 feet in the air Luke, you had a question?
1949.36 1956.56 speaker3  that we're on and then an upper level? Yes. Okay, who's on the basement level?
1952.92 1978.98 speaker2  The basement level is the man who is in the throne of Santa Claus who is chanting and bleeding out currently. The Santa twins are on the basement level as well who are wrapping each other with gift wrapping and duct tape. The three elves in the ice skating rink are also in the basement level as is the naked mop man
1977.54 1983.94 speaker4  as is the laptop girl.
1983.10 1990.90 speaker2  You can ask me anything Luke.
1988.74 1991.90 speaker1  Who's on the level we're on?
1990.90 2005.32 speaker3  I want you to show me. Make him tell us.
2002.12 2014.40 speaker2  On your level is the reindeer fur girl and then on the next level climbing up to the next level is the cousin lady climber. Gotcha, thank you.
2012.04 2017.96 speaker3  I wanna draw my pistol if I can.
2016.04 2023.60 speaker2  so you can do whatever you want. Yeah, I don't know. Are we starting combat? No, we are, yeah.
2021.56 2038.48 speaker3  I draw my pistol and point it at the reindeer girl and I say, touch not mine creatures and then I look at my gun and I'm like, I must use these mortal instruments to achieve my divine means. Fire, I aim in fire.
2035.84 2041.24 speaker2  Okay, so she is across the atrium from you so as you say that.
2040.00 2045.08 speaker3  I got a 65.
2043.62 2048.76 speaker2  that she'll be able to hear you
2047.88 2055.10 speaker4  I'm assuming.
2053.86 2067.36 speaker3  Roll firearms for me. I am the universe experience in itself. 43 on a 60.
2065.50 2095.72 speaker2  immediately falls to the ground and the bullet goes through and one of the reindeer's and she is on the ground bleeding as she tries to grab on to the hairless reindeer in front of her to help herself up. She goes limp and her head just like hits the ground.
2092.28 2103.24 speaker1  The look on Zach's face just now is, huh.
2099.60 2111.04 speaker3  I just want to resolve that as quickly as possible.
2110.20 2112.16 speaker1  It's not my fault.
2111.04 2117.54 speaker2  It's not your fault.
2116.04 2120.96 speaker3  Dude, you can't change the past.
2120.12 2124.88 speaker2  Go for it.
2123.78 2137.82 speaker3  I shoot another reindeer.
2136.98 2143.70 speaker1  Sorry about that.
2141.18 2165.74 speaker2  He just grabbed his McDonald's cup and shook it. That was habit. Okay. Love that.
2164.90 2176.58 speaker3  I am. You're not. I hope that's your character talking. Hey Donovan.
2175.30 2182.36 speaker2  Mildly panicked. Uh-huh. Do you want to go ahead and roll sanity for me?
2180.68 2186.10 speaker1  I don't know what to roll it against.
2184.02 2218.14 speaker2  I think based on the week that you've had, you're going to roll it against a pretty solid 58. Okay. You can hold yourself together for the time being, but just so you know, this is the first time that Donovan, I'm assuming has seen anyone get shot or maybe even any animal. Yes. Only sprouts for this boy.
2217.30 2219.80 speaker1  You know what?
2218.96 2228.14 speaker2  I really respect that. Thank you.
2226.02 2244.72 speaker1  I think Donovan, after the first gunshot, Cause it's the first time a gun has been fired probably in his vicinity ever. Yeah. And it is quite frightening. I would imagine to a fifth year college student. It's yeah.
2243.90 2246.98 speaker3  Yeah.
2246.06 2251.04 speaker1  Wow.
2247.00 2257.20 speaker3  So America has an epidemic of gun violence.
2253.12 2262.68 speaker2  everyone begins to panic and obsess a little bit harder.
2259.78 2267.28 speaker1  who was throwing the laptop, how would he do that? He wants to do that. Okay.
2265.84 2278.46 speaker2  into the basement of the atrium and then past the Santa twins and the naked mop man before you got to the laptop girl.
2277.62 2283.98 speaker1  And I'm going down the stairs. So you take off running.
2282.06 2287.82 speaker2  then you'll make it there no problem.
2285.98 2298.54 speaker1  If something, if something wants to stop me, I get to, I get to fight back, but I'm hoping that they'll.
2296.46 2344.54 speaker3  And the first person between him and the top girl is the twins. Yes. I'm going to run behind with him. But right before I start going down the stairs, take a shot at the one on the left. Okay. I say. And I say, I'm the bill of the ball. Ding, ding. right between the eyeballs. Yeah. And Santa dies.
2343.16 2376.88 speaker2  You're the new Santa Claus. Look at me. I'm the Santa now. Grabs the duct tape out of the hand of his fellow Santa as the man just drops to the ground. The duct tape being the only thing left. And he just smoothly continues wrapping himself in this duct tape. I would look at Clark.
2375.48 2388.84 speaker3  And I follow suit. Clark is running at the laptop girl. No one's fucking with any more reindeer. Are there any threats we see around us?
2388.00 2390.04 speaker1  or was she above us already?
2388.84 2393.82 speaker3  Climbing to the second floor.
2392.98 2415.74 speaker2  And we're on the second floor? Yeah. Can I reach her? and then probably get on the garland yourself and begin climbing before you got to her. Cause she, when those first gunshots rang out, she really started going for it. She's free soloing this bitch like a moat. I just watched that. It was so fucking good.
2414.70 2433.82 speaker3  My hands are sweaty. Unrelated. Yeah, I want to shoot the old broad. I'm kidding. I'm going to cover, I'm going to cover Joe. Clark, I want to see. Oh yeah. Can you ready an action in Delta Green? You can ready an action in Delta Green. So I'm going to be on Overwatch for Clark. Dope.
2433.00 2442.72 speaker2  Sounds good, Justin. What's Donovan doing?
2440.44 2452.22 speaker1  like even like a bat or a plant, it's like some kind of thing I could use as a makeshift weapon just to like arm myself.
2451.38 2457.98 speaker3  and you just grab it out of the air and chuck it at one of the Santas. You become Batman.
2457.14 2503.46 speaker2  So as. Badminton? Badminton. So as you're shuttle cocking your way, Leon Simpson, halfway down the stairs, and throws a gun to Donovan and then grabs you by the shoulder and takes you like around a corner where you both can watch, but you're a little bit safer away from everything. but I would rather you didn't is that you're our savior. and if you don't, it's on you. He just like gets really sad
2502.18 2505.98 speaker1  Okay.
2504.42 2510.56 speaker2  that you should probably not die today?
2509.52 2512.22 speaker1  I think we're good to go.
2511.40 2513.46 speaker2  So.
2512.22 2517.56 speaker1  Wait, wait, wait, how do I use this?
2515.72 2537.02 speaker2  but like very quickly. Roll a 50-50 shot on whether or not you know how to use this gun at all. you know how to do it, yeah.
2536.02 2539.18 speaker1  Ooh. Nice.
2537.86 2566.12 speaker2  It feels natural. the lady climbing up the garland, all three elves, the naked mop man, and the girl throwing the laptop in the air, all stop what they're doing and begin chanting.
2564.24 2574.12 speaker4  Tall, we allow the call. Tall, we allow the call. Tall, we allow the call.
2569.72 2596.38 speaker2  The man in the throne of the Santa Claus dressing runs and jumps onto, so there's like a four poster chair for the elf that sits next to him, and he jumps on it with his neck landing directly on, what are those called at the top of like a four poster? Like a spinet? We'll call it a spinet. And if that's not a word, that's what it means now.
2595.14 2602.14 speaker1  At the top of a post.
2600.82 2614.14 speaker3  An uppy pointy, just a straight up and downer. So he jumps on the chair stalagmite.
2612.06 2642.68 speaker2  And punctures his own throat and immediately just like, and begins bleeding. and the chants get louder from everyone else. What do you want to do? and no longer paying attention to the laptop
2641.56 2654.86 speaker1  I don't know how many actions this is, but I'd like to catch the laptop so it doesn't hit the ground, but knock her in the chin. Just see if it clocks her. Is that the way she's throwing it? I could do that, yeah.
2651.16 2655.70 speaker2  It'll land directly on her head if you do nothing.
2654.86 2670.78 speaker1  Oh, I'll do nothing then. Yeah, if it's coming down on her. Let's see what happens. I'll let that play out and then I'll see what I do.
2668.92 2700.00 speaker2  The laptop comes down in such a way that the most sturdy edge comes down directly on her temple because as she's chanting, she's turning her head to the side completely in this weird like you just said squirrel to a dog kind of way. It hits her directly above the ear in the side of the head and she goes blank, roll luck for me.
2699.16 2713.52 speaker1  Nice. Okay, I want to grab the laptop and her and run retreat back to the second floor.
2711.84 2730.04 speaker2  but you won't be able to make it all the way back. You can start your way there. What is Keith Vigna doing? They are all staring at one of you.
2729.20 2760.72 speaker3  Oh yeah. I see down. Yeah, I see down about two feet away from me is a candy cane, but the end is sharpened like you're supposed to stick it in your lawn. 100%. And I grab it and I spear it right at him.
2757.78 2795.52 speaker2  and you launch it at your elven foe. in the head of Frosty the snowman. Do they laugh? And it gets stuck there. So there's a candy cane coming out in between the two button eyes. What are the eyes? Coal. And it goes right into the button nose
2794.20 2809.16 speaker3  Now Zach, are these really Santa's elves or are they just people pretending to be Santa's elves? You don't know.
2807.76 2812.52 speaker2  Those ears look real, baby.
2811.16 2813.90 speaker3  Give one a tug if I can.
2812.52 2832.52 speaker2  You can give one a tug if you want cause it's your turn, John Lee Pettymore. What's the naked guy doing? He has put the mop down and he is putting the mop bucket up against the wall and he's beginning to dip his head into the paint Does it bubble up?
2831.70 2849.50 speaker3  As he's chanting. He hasn't gotten in there yet. Thank you. You brought out that big bucket of paint and everything. Yes. And we'll be right back.
2848.02 2850.74 speaker1  Yeah, Zach's gonna have to clean off
2849.50 2853.10 speaker3  for the next 30 minutes.
2852.06 2858.10 speaker2  Just throw some dirt on me. He's in the basement? He is in the basement. Like the lower level?
2857.26 2860.60 speaker3  Okay. So John jumps off the balcony.
2859.76 2862.26 speaker2  On to him.
2861.42 2867.48 speaker3  And from the way he jumps, it looks like he thinks he's like, he literally just kind of like steps off.
2866.64 2874.88 speaker2  All right. Roll dexterity or athletics, whichever one's higher.
2874.04 2905.74 speaker3  Five. What do you do? It's very Chauncey Gardner-ish. He literally just like steps off and then you just see his feet moving through the air like he's walking down steps, but very quickly because he's just falling. it like hits, he steps on the naked man's head and it breaks his fall. And he just glides onto the, like walks onto the floor like he meant to do it. Hell yeah.
2902.46 2924.00 speaker2  Your foot comes down on this naked man and shoves his head into the bottom of the mop. You stand on the other side with literally no paint on you
2922.20 2938.28 speaker3  Since he's literally a fish in the bucket, can I just put my gun up to his head and kill him?
2937.16 2943.14 speaker2  What's been going on here?
2940.58 2952.98 speaker1  but you know, I just, I try to keep to myself and you know, I just wanna have a good time at school. So I just, you know, just kind of been ignoring all this.
2950.86 2960.62 speaker2  I mean, have classes been in session at all?
2959.78 2998.38 speaker1  Gotcha. But I do live on campus. Okay. For fun. That's kind of sad. But I don't really do much. You know, I always thought I was important, but maybe not this important. Yeah, you weren't. I'm sad. Kind of unaffected, honestly. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Donovan's a very like non-emotional human being. Well, let's see if this gets you. Like protecting me? Yeah.
2996.74 3009.30 speaker2  I'm good with being done talking if you just want to watch what's going on here. Or you could take some pot shots.
3008.06 3011.38 speaker1  Like ghost style?
3009.30 3012.46 speaker2  Yeah, I'll show you how to aim.
3011.38 3029.16 speaker1  Oh, no. From behind.
3027.84 3037.64 speaker2  Stop plus 40.
3035.92 3039.36 speaker1  Crip fail. A 99.
3038.48 3071.08 speaker3  It's not a Crip, but it's. Oh, it's a 96. Well, if 69 is a Crip success, should 96 be a Crip fail? but that would be an interesting house rule to add. Let's add it. 96. Fuck, I know I'm gonna be the next person to roll one in like two months when I don't fucking remember this at all.
3068.62 3087.90 speaker2  And then he just, he actually looks at you. He makes direct eye contact with you while he fires, takes one of the elves out and then he turns back. No, he continues looking at you and he's like, did I get him?
3087.06 3099.02 speaker3  You're a scary guy.
3094.02 3184.18 speaker2  So the Santa Claus that is left completely wraps his head up in duct tape and then falls to the ground. The lady climbing up jumps for the disco ball that's in the middle of the room. Misses and falls face first into, I'm gonna say, let's see, she lands. Oh yeah, her crumpled body lands directly on the Santa Claus's throne. It's like her head landed in the spot where the back of your butt is. So it like kind of goes into the seat, like where you lose change and stuff. And the rest of her body just like kind of splits and crumbles on the sides around either arm of the chair. the very, oh no, sorry. The two elves that are left take off their skates completely and slit their own throats with their ice skates. Blood sprays onto the ice as the elves continue laughing, each ha overpowered by the sound of the gurgling. and Clark looking over at the girl throwing the laptop
3182.10 3186.78 speaker1  She's in my arms unconscious.
3184.18 3197.40 speaker2  You feel her breathe out
3196.12 3205.48 speaker1  Bad guys, anybody? but the people who cause mental harm.
3203.04 3205.48 speaker3  We shot them like they were. Fly to fly to the stream.
