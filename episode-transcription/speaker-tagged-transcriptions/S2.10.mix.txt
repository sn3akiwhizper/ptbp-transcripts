Now if you're just tuning in, welcome back. to the pirate vessel, okay? got him fit for a peg leg. That gave Jurgen half the peg legs Dr. Shark left sticking out of the quicksand that had Got all that? Good. Join us now, back to the action on this island with a big ol' statue of a humanoid alligator It's R.I. Peter with Cruisin'!
430.52 433.76 speaker3  you laughed.
431.52 435.76 speaker2  All of our listeners are in Hillsong, that are in Australia. Really?
434.76 452.72 speaker3  Yeah. Is Hillsong the name of a town? Damn. The whole country is Hillsong. Yeah.
451.36 485.10 speaker2  Those were Hillsongs, right? Yes, they were. These hills have songs. These hills are alive with the sound of music. What did the guy say in Jason? Friday the 13th? It's a blood curse! It's a blood curse! You ought to be lucky the mental asylum fucking closed down or you'd be getting beat every day by Nurse Ratched.
484.10 486.10 speaker3  Captain Neckbeard.
485.10 539.74 speaker2  Captain Neckbeard. Was that it? Yes. Nice. Captain Neckbeard's dead, the rest of it's serious. The bubbles rising above where the dread pirate neck beard had gone under have ceased to bubble. And the crew from Neckbeard's ship ties their belts together. Wait, all together? Like in a circle? Yeah. Yep, to each other. And then they hold each other's shoulders and begin walking back toward the beach. Are you Neckbeard's?
536.86 543.82 speaker4  Your captain just killed our doctor with his stupidity.
542.10 568.86 speaker2  Wish YU is a doctor. The three of them all look at each other and let's roll luck, 50-50 shot up and down. Is that a 10 or a 100? It's a 10. I can't see what the- It's a 10. No, 100 is all zeros. It's a 10. It's a 10! Yeah! And I was actually gonna say-
567.26 573.94 speaker4  He's a fucking medical chap.
570.86 600.42 speaker2  And the other two kind of move, try to shuffle behind him. But again- I have 100 minus whatever you rolled is what I was gonna say. What's your name? I'm very, very skilled. Jammin? Did you say, uh, Shammin?
599.42 608.54 speaker3  Did you say Jermaine?
607.54 612.64 speaker2  Yes. I'm very scared right now. I think it's Jimmy. All right, Jimmy.
611.64 629.02 speaker4  He nods.
627.02 630.02 speaker3  I mean, I've got swords.
629.02 638.94 speaker2  Okay. I'll swing to try and cut him free from the other two. Oh, cool. Which one of you would be more likely to do a cool, yeah.
634.86 652.82 speaker3  I have like a knife that I can just cut the rope with. Who would do it cool? Can you beat that? Oh, he's the one in the middle. Okay.
651.82 667.50 speaker2  Yeah. We'll throw at the same time. We'll show off these sword tricks. Don't pass mine.
665.22 674.90 speaker3  28 on a 70.
672.46 693.46 speaker2  so he just hits the rope with the scabbard. He just reaches down and cuts the other side and looks at alabaster owl and is like, oh,
689.46 719.78 speaker3  Alabaster stares at him for a second with like a questioning look and then he, he looks over at Mr. Spitz. I forgot we lost our doctor. The rest of you, uh, go wade into the quicksand.
718.78 720.78 speaker2  Okay.
719.78 726.98 speaker3  I, yeah. Then I like, I'm not intimidated at all. I'm like expecting them to just wade into the quicksand.
725.98 730.16 speaker2  Oh God.
727.98 733.50 speaker4  If we could actually just go back to the ship, that'd be great. Just knee deep and you were here.
732.50 737.18 speaker3  Yeah. Maybe some more neck pads will come along.
735.42 754.58 speaker4  Maybe the jungle will take you.
751.46 770.14 speaker3  So you need to get in the quicksand. You don't have to go all the way neck deep or, you know, head deep as your captain did, but you need to stay there. So fucking walk into the quicksand now. Eye roll, persuade.
769.14 772.14 speaker4  like you found your voice there.
770.14 788.54 speaker3  Yeah, mine are bad on all this. Mine are bad. I got 15% intimidate. Oh my God.
785.26 807.18 speaker2  Like they're both going to shoulder check you as they walk past. And then basically as soon as they get past, they are going to run as fast as they can. What do you do? How many of those do you have?
806.18 817.70 speaker3  the? Anybody? The belly. The death of a salesman.
816.70 825.22 speaker2  There's a number of different things. The inside. Below deck.
823.26 828.22 speaker3  Can I roll heavy weapons on that?
827.22 831.22 speaker2  Yeah, that's six.
830.22 859.14 speaker3  As these two run off. Can I tell you what happens with a grenade? They bump into me and like shoulder check me and without even looking, I just kind of in front of them and they look down for a second.
852.66 903.34 speaker2  onto the leaves and all the foliage around as, as limbs just kind of fly around and the rest of you kind of turn around and you see that Mitch has taken his rope, everybody's got a rope and has been pulling out the body of Dr. Shark this whole time. He kind of got it around one of the peg legs and is pulled enough to where the whole body is coming out now and you see that Dr. Shark's head and specifically the ears are just completely
897.54 920.82 speaker4  Do we represent an advanced body of our crew or are they more aboard?
914.86 954.46 speaker2  He walks deeper into the forest jungle of this island and as he does, he turns around one of these trees that's in the distance and seems to be grabbing at something. And then as you approach, you see that he's putting on a cloak, like a black hooded cloak and it goes over his entire body and covers his head or over his eyes, Jedi style, but You started motioning with your hands.
950.14 959.82 speaker4  No, I really thought you were going to like describe it as a crop top.
957.00 975.30 speaker2  It's absolutely a crop top. He can be wearing it. They're going to be so angry if they found out that I wasn't wearing this before.
972.94 984.90 speaker4  And now you look good. What would you even call a garment like that?
983.90 985.90 speaker2  Yeah, it's a crudy.
984.90 996.82 speaker3  I love that movie.
993.54 1006.18 speaker2  How you became a Beatle.
1002.90 1007.18 speaker3  my whole band and the favorite, my whole favorite band in the world.
1006.18 1026.66 speaker4  They sing. We shave a belly with a rusty razor.
1024.66 1059.82 speaker2  And you guys walk further and further in. And as you're walking, you can see that, that pillar of smoke in the distance that you're walking toward, but you, you approach a clearing far before this, this pillar of smoke that's in the distance. You have now. Yes, absolutely. And how are you transporting the body of Dr. Shark? I thought Mitch was on that. He's just been dragging the body.
1056.58 1063.50 speaker4  I didn't understand why he wanted it, but I, he said it would be advantageous.
1059.82 1114.78 speaker2  He just kind of kept the rope tied around it and just continues to drag it and he's seem really cool. So I'm really rooting for you and I hope you win.
1113.78 1129.54 speaker3  it. Jimmy, are you not going to be our doctor?
1128.54 1132.90 speaker4  He's sad about it.
1129.98 1145.78 speaker3  Jimmy, are you going to be our doctor?
1139.74 1159.42 speaker2  Jimmy smiles a wry smile that says that he's not intimidated by you at all. Wait, wait, wait. You're absolutely right. We're still covered.
1158.42 1174.94 speaker4  I'm so sorry. What does blood do, doc?
1173.94 1177.86 speaker2  It flows.
1175.94 1190.98 speaker4  Don't get clever with us.
1189.38 1216.02 speaker3  He'll be a good doctor.
1215.02 1218.02 speaker2  because you failed. You're an intimidation checker here.
1217.02 1224.02 speaker3  Oh, okay. I'm an idiot then. I don't know.
1223.02 1233.86 speaker4  Yeah, especially with his vocal cords cut. Yeah.
1232.86 1234.86 speaker3  Maybe I'm a doctor.
1233.86 1237.58 speaker4  Let's not.
1236.58 1240.58 speaker3  I don't want to. That's too ridiculous.
1239.58 1246.90 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah.
1245.90 1268.54 speaker2  I'm Mitch.
1266.26 1282.86 speaker3  Should we be wearing a crude like you?
1276.66 1381.12 speaker2  And he opens it up into this clearing and you see, uh, you see another ditch immediately as soon as you're on the other side of the clearing. And this ditch is not filled with blood. It's filled with a clear liquid that one might assume is water. And that's not the only different thing about this ditch. This one, you can actually see where it continues on either side and it goes in a large circle, which is the circle of this clearing that exists here in the middle of this island in the jungle. So is it like right next to the edge of the trees and stuff? Yes. Yeah. And just inside of that moat, uh, you see another moat and another and another, and they get smaller and smaller as they would as they go inside. And some are filled with water. Some are filled with blood. mindful of, uh, the gutters and the trenches, all of these canals. And he looks out and in the middle of all of these pools, you see, there are a few other crudy wearing folks. There are three mean pirate camp counselors, mean pirate.
1380.12 1390.76 speaker4  it. Pirate camp.
1389.76 1411.36 speaker0  All right.
1408.76 1423.68 speaker3  mysterious man, we will follow the lead. I've never had this guy's name ever in my life.
1422.68 1443.64 speaker2  jaw. And from underneath his hood, when, when you say that about Mitch, he gets a big smile
1442.64 1446.64 speaker3  Oh, sorry. Human jaw.
1445.64 1452.96 speaker2  We're playing pulp Cthulhu. It's a human. I know it's human.
1448.64 1469.72 speaker3  It's not like, like you'd look at them and be like your jaws five times the size of somebody It's like a chiseled jaw.
1466.72 1483.72 speaker4  So there's a real Chad in a, uh, a chode.
1481.72 1486.72 speaker2  The five of us.
1483.72 1496.72 speaker4  We're going to a weekend at Bernie's, Dr. Shark.
1495.72 1519.72 speaker2  the circle. The largest of these moats connects all five of these pools of water. And you would see that currently three of these pools are unvacant.
1518.72 1524.72 speaker4  Taken.
1522.72 1543.72 speaker3  Occupied, full. Like filled with water. Filled with people.
1536.72 1573.72 speaker2  They are laying flat on their backs with their ears in the water, but their eyes and nose and mouth above water. backs? Go ahead and roll a medical check for intelligence. All three of them. Oh, it's only three. I thought each pool had a number of bodies in there. Yeah.
1572.72 1574.72 speaker3  Oh, my bad.
1573.72 1590.72 speaker2  Sorry. One person per pool. One person per pool. These pools are only big enough for one body to lay flat, almost like a pod. Gotcha.
1588.72 1594.72 speaker4  There are three pods.
1593.72 1599.72 speaker2  Okay. They can't.
1598.72 1601.72 speaker3  Yeah.
1599.72 1617.72 speaker4  Edward Spitz does not cross himself for three bodies. He spits.
1612.72 1630.72 speaker3  a little bit of gunpowder out of my pocket and flick it on one of their faces to see if it moves with their breath.
1627.72 1727.72 speaker2  If you could come this way, we must begin. He might much look bad. Each orator? And as he says orator, he motions at each side of him. words. And he points and you see two barrels kind of at the edge of the jungle. Like a wine barrel? words. In order to win the competition, your orator must not be interrupted. A steady stream must come from both their mouth and their bong hole. But each crew must leave a deposit here to ensure the safe return of our orators.
1718.72 1734.72 speaker4  It's a really good thing we kidnapped a bloke.
1733.72 1737.72 speaker2  body.
1736.72 1754.72 speaker4  Yeah. What are your sunglasses? They are how you disguise a body that is dead and make it look like it's alive and having
1753.72 1757.72 speaker2  Two eye patches?
1754.72 1793.72 speaker3  Well, it's something that Alabaster was asked to make. No, Dr. Spitz asked me, Mr. Spitz asked me to make something to block the sun and I made out of broken brown bottles, I crafted you some Oakley looking futuristic glasses.
1791.72 1795.72 speaker4  and put them on Dr. Shark.
1793.72 1802.72 speaker2  It works.
1800.72 1819.72 speaker4  out of them. Mr. Mystery Men.
1817.72 1830.72 speaker3  If they can't do it, no one can. I'm excited so, no, I'm not excited so I'm talking like this.
1828.72 1840.72 speaker2  man and the crudy.
1838.72 1856.72 speaker4  Mitch, do you know the words? I whisper in his ear, do you know the words, boy? Very cool.
1853.72 1903.72 speaker2  Mitch whispers like, yes, very quickly. flashes you just a massive smile full of warmth and joy.
1902.72 1921.72 speaker3  for later.
1916.72 1929.72 speaker4  So we've got big man, woman, clock the other person and see if I see a familiar relation between all of them.
1928.72 1935.72 speaker3  So let's see if I roll better. Nope. Did you pass? Did you pass? Yeah, pass.
1934.72 1940.72 speaker2  Rad. Yeah. So this is the Diggory family. You recognize the Diggory family.
1939.72 1946.72 speaker4  Cedric Diggory? Holy shit. They're wearing robes too.
1944.72 1964.72 speaker2  Are we going to fight a dragon? The Diggory family is extremely well known. Oh shit. Very, very wealthy and have been missing for some time.
1962.72 1983.72 speaker4  Oh, the Diggory family. Doc. The person. The Diggory family, Robinson. I love the idea of a very wealthy family all out here in their shitty fucking crop top hoodies.
1982.72 1985.72 speaker2  Yep.
1984.72 1992.72 speaker3  Am I imagining this wrong? They've got a hood, right? Yep.
1991.72 1994.72 speaker2  Got it.
1993.72 2005.72 speaker4  This is hilarious. We haven't clocked to the third one.
2004.72 2013.72 speaker2  Okay. So mother, father, son.
2012.72 2022.72 speaker4  Grey.
2019.72 2052.72 speaker2  I thought that was Grey's Anatomy name or something. Because he's got a neck beard.
2050.72 2058.72 speaker3  Or like a suffocation, maybe?
2057.72 2060.72 speaker4  let go.
2058.72 2077.72 speaker2  Then yes, you are the last. joy.
2076.72 2126.72 speaker3  Oh, yes. Yeah. And so we are already winning the game, I think, as far as I see it. Don't worry about our guys.
2122.72 2147.72 speaker4  Yeah, we thought we should have two doctors and that would be smart. That's why we got a fellow with the funny looking glasses. And Edward says that. Also, that's not a neckbeard. He just can't grow over it. He's not part of the crew. He just can't.
2143.72 2162.72 speaker3  Also, Captain Neckbeard said we could have his ship and use it for the competition as he was suffocating or choking or drowning, whatever.
2154.72 2168.72 speaker2  I honestly couldn't care less as long as the stream from the bungalow is never cut.
2167.72 2222.72 speaker4  bungalow? bows and his shitty wig falls off. So me and your boy Mitch are going to help him over to his hole. Any problem, you won't hear a peep out of him this whole time, I'd imagine. Oh God, not at all.
2216.72 2283.72 speaker2  She's already turned around and is looking deeply into her husband's eyes and saying goodbye. into this pool and his ears are in the water, his eyes, nose and mouth are above and this quicksand that was all gummed up the works of his head begins kind of mixing with the water. and that is how you will know to begin the race. One end must come to the other, do you understand?
2277.72 2293.72 speaker4  We could send the ships two different ways, we get there twice as fast.
2292.72 2316.72 speaker0  That's true.
2313.72 2321.72 speaker4  anything happens to it, go for it Mitch.
2316.72 2343.72 speaker3  I think if anything gets fired at us though, we have that protecting us because those men to me didn't know about them yesterday, won't know about them tomorrow. If they die, they die. Oh, you mean the neckbeards? Not our crew. I agree. Not our crew that I could name every single one of them if you asked me to. Every, all, all of them. I know there's a certain number but...
2340.72 2376.72 speaker4  As any of us could, name all ninety souls aboard. I'm not great at counting. I heard that mate. And he looks down at his well encrusted... They pleasure themselves most terribly.
2374.72 2415.72 speaker3  I'd say so my Australian friend. On the way back, Alabaster, he feels pretty uncomfortable with like, just having left the dead body of his like, Dr. Shark is taking care of him like, kept him alive and so he just watched that whole thing go down and was like, uncomfortable but he sings this
2414.72 2465.72 speaker4  Dr. Sh-
2463.72 2471.72 speaker3  Sittin' in his belly with a rusty razor Shave his belly with a rusty razor Shave his belly with a rusty razor
2469.72 2475.72 speaker2  Early in the mornin'
2473.72 2477.72 speaker3  Hey, and up she rises
2475.72 2489.72 speaker2  Hey, and up she rises That's how we do it with the junkins Early in the mornin'
2487.72 2497.72 speaker3  Five paragraph essay, like
2495.72 2497.72 speaker0  That's what we do with the drunken sailor That's what we do with the drunken sailor
