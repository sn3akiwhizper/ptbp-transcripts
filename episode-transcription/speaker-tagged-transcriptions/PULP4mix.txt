0.00 41.68 speaker0  Hello, my friends. It's once again your fabulously ferocious furry friend, Wolf the Dog. And I am your host with the most, your hoist with the moist, your greasy baby, your large friend with the good hair. And I'm talking at y'all live from sometime here at 694.2 PTBP, wherever I am's best whatever this is. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Alchemy Yeti with Two T's,
38.08 48.56 speaker1  Have you considered doing something similar, listener?
45.68 137.28 speaker0  Alchemy Yeti with Two T's writes, Well, hello there, my dearest Wolf. Appreciate the howl. How's the gourbage been treatin' ya? Hopefully extra slimy for your eclectic tastes. PTBP has been a favorite of ours ever since the trailer you fine boys put out. and you've all been a wonderful inspiration to start up another mystery horror series. Can't wait to ingest your future projects. Wishin' you the spiciest and most fetid under grime, Yeti. But uh, Twitch? YouTube? What about MeTube? TTRPG? Trash today's really pissin' good? What else could that even mean? You may speak in words that only bring confusion to me, You truly seem to be a gourmand like myself, with only the finest tastes in trash.
132.32 147.44 speaker1  or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and holler at us about it.
143.84 163.52 speaker0  And if you wanna submit a name and description
159.84 215.92 speaker1  get your mitts on some shirts that kicketh ass, alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas, as your fellow players. You know what they say. The links are in the show notes. Last time, our intrepid hero smashed part of Cicero Mordaunt's new invention
210.00 233.68 speaker0  before Lafayette J. Honeycutt showed off his radical fucking jetpack.
230.56 288.80 speaker1  to call out to the power he swore to help, let himself be used as a vessel, And now, using a word that encapsulates that scene, I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and ragged bone You were hollow when you spoke to me
285.20 312.40 speaker2  Hollow when you sang I thought you might be starving So I gave you everything
311.52 339.28 speaker0  You kinda are. Yeah, you absolutely are. That's how we promote the show.
336.96 344.08 speaker3  He ended up a redhead at the end of the day.
341.92 350.08 speaker2  Yeah, Zach, you did something last episode. Welcome to Pretending to Be People.
346.32 352.00 speaker3  This is the fourth episode of The Thing You're Listening To.
351.44 362.24 speaker2  I'm Zach. I'm playing Elden Ring, and I did not kill anyone last episode.
358.16 363.76 speaker3  He doesn't play video games, but his character's name is Elden Ring.
362.24 387.20 speaker2  Oh, that's why it's funny. It is cool. I've been hearing people saying it so often. I thought it was a TikToker. I'm playing Checkers, a cult leader who talks like this.
386.40 422.88 speaker3  Is it going to be hard? He passed it already, it seems like, so no. All right, see you, Joe. I'm a big, strong guy, but I hurt myself when I'm punching out a window upstairs up there. After some difficulty, I made it down to the ground. And my buddy here, my boss, he's an inventor, and I just saw him take off in his new invention. It's a sight to behold, I can tell you that much.
418.72 426.56 speaker2  He was last seen flying off into the snowstorm with his jetpack.
422.88 439.92 speaker3  Yeah, because there is no better time to test a prototype jetpack than in a 50 or 60 mile per hour snowstorm.
437.92 443.04 speaker2  He brought a fully fleshed out. Do you know how many Harveys died?
441.84 448.32 speaker3  Do you know there's flesh on it?
446.96 449.46 speaker2  To get ready for this one?
448.96 455.92 speaker3  Yeah.
454.08 462.32 speaker2  Do you call them all Harvey, or do they-
460.08 463.84 speaker3  and it's the one that worked, and that's why he's still with you? Yeah.
462.72 480.40 speaker2  Or have I not touched it yet? No, you've tested it, and it could move your bulk around and everything. He's like, this is the one. Do you call it the jetpack, or do you have like a- It's called the X1 right now, but- It's not called the fuck you gravity.
479.20 485.44 speaker3  It's a pretty cool name. That is pretty cool.
483.36 575.68 speaker2  This is my my fig. You probably are like binging all of these so you know what just happened, but what just happened? Okay, but I didn't kill anyone. I, again- You exploded his head. Yeah, but again, because- More manslaughter than murder because you didn't really want to do it. A guy died because of him. Exactly. I was only a conduit, again. That's like what you say like when you hit somebody with your car. I was just a conduit. Of the car's power. Right. My hands are clean. You hit the ball a little too hard.
571.92 587.06 speaker3  I think we'll deal with the aftermath of that in a few moments. Before then, I really want to catch up with Lafayette. Me too. Yes, I'm very intrigued.
582.42 604.74 speaker2  I think we all would, but what if he just comes jetpacking through the window at the climax? Oh no, you're not getting off that. That's next episode.
602.34 627.46 speaker3  in high winds and no visibility.
624.02 654.66 speaker2  You should say a parachute too, just in case. He is. Inspector jetpack. 10 luck spent very well. to make a glow-in-the-dark little display for his compass, and so he's looking at it on his wrist, and he's like guiding the jetpack straight towards the house.
653.22 674.50 speaker3  As David Bowie plays.
671.14 700.34 speaker2  No, that's a talent, and I think it gave me 10 in mythos. Seeing as how you built yourself a jetpack, it'd be weird if you didn't have points there. I'm trying to find it on the sheet.
696.34 703.78 speaker3  I thought you were trying to take points off of other skills and put them into pilot.
701.70 711.54 speaker2  No, I'm not doing that to drive auto.
708.34 725.70 speaker3  There's no way that there's not a chance.
722.10 730.10 speaker2  I have 35 in pilot, just enough to make it spicy. Love it. That's spicy as hell, baby.
728.42 736.42 speaker3  Let's see how this goes. That's too much.
733.38 745.62 speaker2  Are we still playing 69 as crit goodness? Always. But it wasn't 69. Nope, it was 62.
743.14 749.54 speaker3  I played on another podcast recently that did that. I can't remember which one it was.
747.46 772.26 speaker2  It was our Scott, you're with us now. That's the face of a yes.
770.50 775.22 speaker3  That would put me at 29 luck.
773.94 784.18 speaker2  No, you said Dane. Because you went up on the skill. Right, because you want to add to the roll.
782.50 787.38 speaker3  Right, to make it a 69.
784.18 793.06 speaker2  So I gained seven luck and I make it a 69. So we do that, Scott. We do that.
791.06 801.30 speaker3  Can I just cut all this short and say no?
800.50 812.58 speaker2  He let us lick. We got pretty lucky.
807.30 858.82 speaker3  So yes, there you are barreling through the air in your jet pack, unable to see where you're going. You're getting thrown around by the winds. It's almost completely uncontrollable at the moment. But you are at least navigating in roughly the right direction. But at the moment, it does look like your options are going to be limited to trying to maybe land somewhere on the building. But there's a good chance you'll just smack into the wall if you do that, rather than, say, break through a window. Because there is fundamentally a lot more wall than window. Or you might be able to ditch the snowdrift if you're lucky and you can find one deep enough.
857.62 867.78 speaker2  a few feet had fallen, right? Checkers was no longer able to see our footprints. Was I knee-high in snow, walking out there?
866.34 890.10 speaker3  Yeah, it was pretty much that. And it's probably got deeper since then. On the other hand, you do know that there are quite a lot of cars parked outside. So if you just plummeted in the wrong place, you might end up having a rather hard landing.
884.74 924.66 speaker2  I would like to look for the tallest, fluffiest pine tree around here. Presumably it's got, you know... They're so fluffy. Especially when they're snow covered. Exactly. I just want to like, I'm going to turn the engine off and drift into a tree and try to hug it down.
921.78 929.94 speaker3  And yeah, there are high winds.
924.66 947.40 speaker2  Well, I see Scott, I didn't succeed in a pilot role when I tried to control it. So I thought, what if I just don't? Uncontrol it.
946.90 968.52 speaker3  Awesome. I mean, you know, if you succeed on this, you're going to land in your tree as you want. If not, you're going to land somewhere else. Fair enough. And you can't spend luck on this.
968.02 977.62 speaker2  Yes!
973.14 992.90 speaker4  Starman, waiting in the sky.
990.02 1010.90 speaker2  he just thinks about his kick-ass jetpack and he says, this is going to blow Cicero's mind.
1005.70 1032.98 speaker3  sticking out from a fairly large pine tree and you've shaken all the snow off it. And it is bending nicely and easing you down a bit. You can see that you're still a bit off the ground, but there is the roof of one of the
1031.78 1044.34 speaker2  And he yells, parkour! You utilized that last branch.
1041.46 1098.42 speaker3  You slide down a bit on some of the tiles. It's not too heavily sloped and managed to just catch yourself in the guttering. The flying pig! thing that you can just catch glimpses of it every now and then as the wind shifts, but it's moving. It's scuttling. That's the word. It's scuttling across the roof. And then it stops for a moment as you hit the guttering. And at that point it seems to have noticed you. And it is now scuttling in your direction.
1097.86 1103.86 speaker2  The potty? Yeah, is this a chauffeur party building? It probably is.
1102.74 1108.74 speaker3  You'd guess, maybe.
1108.26 1114.66 speaker4  I just...
1112.50 1126.82 speaker2  And he lets go of the gutter. He just wants to drop and get away from this thing. And he wants to then run into the chauffeur's party.
1121.78 1155.70 speaker3  First thing, let's have a sand roll as you see this thing scuttling towards you. There's there's crenellations and ridges all over his head that are just throbbing. And things sticking out, sharp things.
1152.82 1158.10 speaker2  But well, and then he lets go.
1155.70 1163.94 speaker3  Okay, give me a jump roll to have a graceful landing.
1162.02 1167.38 speaker2  Oh, that is a base plan. What, 20?
1166.34 1170.10 speaker3  Oh, 100.
1169.14 1170.82 speaker2  That's a hundred.
1170.10 1211.06 speaker3  Oh my God. That's a hundred. And you leap off and suddenly, I mean, you're there hanging by one leg, swinging backwards and forwards like a screaming pendulum as this thing scuttles across the roof towards you and looks down at you. Oh my God.
1209.14 1236.02 speaker4  I wonder if that thing has too many legs.
1229.70 1241.70 speaker3  now slightly blood splattered ladder and made it down to, I guess, the comparative safety of the ground.
1237.14 1254.18 speaker2  Yeah, as we get into the ground, I get down there and then I help Harvey down the last few steps and I've got like quite a bit of blood on my face from it dripping down from you. Yeah.
1253.22 1269.14 speaker4  Did you see which way he went?
1263.94 1275.46 speaker2  have like illuminate the area enough for us to look around and see?
1273.62 1291.22 speaker3  So you wouldn't be able to see him from where you are. But if you start moving up towards the main building, you could probably see him fairly easily.
1290.10 1313.22 speaker4  How's your arm? I tore my sleeve off here and I put it down there on the last little accent.
1306.42 1334.50 speaker2  In addition to the first aid, I'm going to use my resourceful talent to have some antiseptic and bandages on me. Okay. So spend the 10 points of luck. Okay. That puts me at 22. 35 on a 50 first aid.
1329.06 1336.18 speaker3  You are helped as well by the comparatively bright light of the burning tower above your head.
1335.46 1350.02 speaker4  Perfect.
1343.38 1362.66 speaker3  And there are little bits of burning debris that are beginning to fall down like Satan's own hell stones.
1357.78 1371.54 speaker2  I bandage your arm up and then I like tenderly like put my hands around your arm and I look at you and say, you can take the last branch for that. Now let's run.
1369.86 1379.06 speaker4  That feels so much better. Oh shit.
1377.78 1381.22 speaker2  He's just excited.
1380.02 1394.42 speaker4  It's so much better feeling now. Thanks.
1392.74 1400.90 speaker3  where, what he's doing to get out of there. Yeah.
1394.58 1406.82 speaker2  I mean, running might be an overstatement for how you're going to try not to fall down.
1400.90 1438.58 speaker3  But yeah, you, you Trump your way through the snow and there are larger and larger bits falling off the burning tower now smacking into the snow around you. a spot. Hit and roll. Both of us. Yeah. and just miss the swinging form of Lafayette.
1437.54 1461.70 speaker4  Holy shit.
1458.74 1475.22 speaker2  the tower as it's like collapsing on itself. So oblivious, pretty good distraction, oblivious to everything else around him. as he turns around.
1471.86 1477.54 speaker3  I was about to say, if you want to use that as the basis for a pushed.
1475.22 1485.86 speaker2  Yes, I do want to use that as a basis for a push.
1483.94 1514.98 speaker4  Can I push it for the same reason too, right? Did Harvey look at all?
1510.74 1561.06 speaker3  So, you know, I mean, they're in the light from the burning tower and also from the light coming out of the house where, or the outbuilding rather, where the chauffeurs were having their little party. You can just see the outline of Lafayette in his jet pack, swinging backwards and forwards by one leg. There is something above him, but you can also see through the windows of the house behind him. And yeah, I mean, that's the point at which you cat's eye to the thing that is scuttling down over Lafayette.
1558.26 1570.42 speaker4  That's a super duper pass, a three on a 60.
1563.30 1598.66 speaker3  So you're in a position to act, but Checkers, having failed that push, I think you're standing there as well, looking back at this tower and it's beautiful, isn't it? Just the way the fire is burning there. Oh, it's gorgeous. I mean, it's almost transfixing, isn't it? And it's really easy to stand there just for that moment too long as some of the larger timbers start falling down in your direction.
1594.74 1664.98 speaker2  And it's almost as if every single one of my senses is focused on this. The only thing I can hear is the crackling of the fire in the wood. The only thing I can see is the beauty of the tower on fire. I stick my tongue out and snow falls on it and I'm like, that tastes cold. But what I'm looking at is hot. And I feel the warmth from the fire as it radiates off the tower. What is my sense of like, if I didn't move right now, would it fall right on me? I'm going to say that I'm pretty freaking transfixed on this thing and it's hard to move around in this snow, so.
1663.54 1673.38 speaker3  You're just going to stand there and let it hit you.
1670.58 1705.46 speaker2  sense of urgency in my movements. No. Yeah, really make a point about how you're not trying to dodge the huge tower coming Yeah, maybe without all your luck, it'll still Buster King you. Maybe once it gets close to me, it might snap me out of my way. Oh yeah, maybe you should dodge. Okay.
1704.74 1707.22 speaker4  By how much?
1706.02 1719.94 speaker2  51 out of 25. But then I might die.
1718.82 1729.38 speaker3  can really retry. 22.
1728.50 1736.98 speaker2  So now I can't. Yeah.
1730.98 1793.30 speaker3  Okay, well then these burning timbers just start crashing all around you. The structure atop the tower falls off to one side and explodes in a shower of sparks. The timbers though are falling hard and heavy around you. And one of them does hit you because you don't manage to get out of the way. And you take. Or wax into you and, and it drives you into the snow drift. You are simultaneously freezing and burning at the same time.
1792.90 1801.62 speaker2  Okay. Okay.
1796.58 1832.26 speaker3  But you are at least partially pinned under this burning timber. into pieces because of the fire, but this is a fairly big pole or whatever that, that has landed on you. The bad news is I think he might be preoccupied.
1831.78 1850.58 speaker4  Fuck it. Harvey! Harvey! Help me!
1850.42 1857.46 speaker2  Okay.
1857.14 1865.78 speaker3  arc? Yeah.
1865.38 1868.66 speaker2  Harvey!
1867.86 1870.18 speaker4  I think he wins. Yeah. Oh wait, this is lower?
1869.94 1875.46 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah. Lower is good in this game. Oh, it's good in this game.
1872.90 1882.98 speaker4  It's the hard success versus just a regular success. Then, uh, fuck that.
1880.74 1891.06 speaker3  Up to you, Harvey, which one do you follow? But it certainly sounds like from, from the cries that are reaching you, it sounds like checkers is far more in need.
1889.78 1938.50 speaker4  Harvey, look at your arm! If he's that close to the ground, I think Harvey's instinct would be to help his boss by trying to just grab his ankle and pull it off the scaffolding. Well, that's what I'm saying. I didn't realize he was that close to the ground. I think I can try and do both.
1937.38 1942.10 speaker3  such a long time. You can't help both of them.
1941.38 1970.82 speaker4  I helped you! Help me! at me closest to me right now and I'm going to, I want to rip the other sleeve off of my other arm and I want to create like oven mitts now that I've got a fiery thing I got to pull off a guy and yeah, I want to try and move it off of him. And you're going to try to lift this large burning...
1969.78 1976.74 speaker2  You certainly can.
1974.74 1981.54 speaker3  will take the difficulty level down by one. Cool.
1977.54 1990.98 speaker2  I got a 25 on a 60 for my strength roll.
1988.26 1998.98 speaker4  So I'm going to use seven luck to just make it a success. Nice. Oh, thank goodness.
1997.46 2025.78 speaker3  burning your hands too much. And yeah, it's, I mean, it's difficult at first. This is a really big, heavy timber. And I mean, it's on fire. But somehow, yeah, you put in almost a superhuman amount of strength. Yeah. I mean, it's obviously down to the great first aid that checkers gave you. Yeah.
2024.66 2030.34 speaker4  Push with all your might!
2025.78 2041.46 speaker2  I'm barely able to, like with the, the snow is melting underneath the fire. It's melted just enough that I can slide right out and we drop the, drop the log.
2038.34 2050.34 speaker3  Let's, let's go to Lafayette and see whether you still have a boss.
2046.34 2063.22 speaker2  He sees him go to help him and he's like, he's almost as pissed as he was at Morden. You can have my guy. We'll just switch guys. I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.
2060.50 2082.74 speaker4  Your guy is weird. The old guy is weird. Okay. Yeah.
2075.94 2108.28 speaker3  And this creature now has, has crawled down and is beginning to move its way down your body. You can see his hideous misshapen head pulsing in the light that's coming from the windows and from the burning structure.
2107.78 2112.50 speaker4  Oh yeah.
2108.82 2118.02 speaker2  I think there's many things that can be happening all at once here.
2115.70 2121.38 speaker3  I think if it's a regular success, you're pushing away. And if it's a hard success, you can try igniting the creature.
2121.14 2129.46 speaker2  Yeah. I have a 55 in that.
2128.66 2138.42 speaker4  You rolled a two. I rolled a two. Oh my God. Extreme success.
2135.54 2148.66 speaker2  Like a jet pack fart in the face.
2143.94 2161.94 speaker3  but yeah, your jet catches it straight on and you can see fire engulf it. And yeah, just a sizzling sound as it falls down to the snow and twitches there.
2157.14 2164.18 speaker2  And I do a flip in the air and land next to Harvey and checkers.
2163.22 2189.46 speaker4  Fuck yes.
2188.34 2191.70 speaker3  It's a lot.
2191.22 2194.10 speaker2  Okay.
2193.54 2209.78 speaker3  Okay. bits of flying cranium.
2209.22 2229.46 speaker2  93. Okay.
2224.74 2240.42 speaker3  And, and as, as you reach up, you can feel that there's something hard stuck in your cheek.
2236.26 2250.18 speaker2  cattywampus game of a croquet that's been played through my mind.
2247.46 2255.54 speaker3  a high socket and there's, there's a bit of a high in it as well. Oh my God.
2254.02 2266.26 speaker4  Now you've got an actual third eye. So it works out.
2264.98 2271.38 speaker2  physical realm can hurt me.
2269.14 2310.58 speaker3  Margaret Payne has liked it at this stage. Yeah, well, you get the impression from the acoustics that that voice is coming from quite some distance away.
2305.78 2321.86 speaker2  All right, well, I will be on my way then. Really?
2321.54 2328.10 speaker3  Yeah.
2326.82 2351.22 speaker2  any body into it. Yeah. You love that. He's a PK from Kentucky. A preacher's kid? Yeah, he's a preacher's kid from Kentucky. Is that what you say on the boards?
2348.90 2363.70 speaker4  Yeah, when we're talking about all of our religious trauma.
2361.14 2388.18 speaker2  I am one who follows direction well.
2382.02 2399.94 speaker3  what it is is there's a false door or secret door in the back of it that seems to go to a staircase that's leading down.
2396.98 2414.26 speaker2  And he walks into the wardrobe. C.S. Lewis.
2413.14 2443.54 speaker3  I just got good. Appreciate you. Yeah, you head down. There's a set of wooden stairs that are going down. There's brick lined walls and you can see light coming from down below.
2442.50 2454.74 speaker2  Calm down. I'm so sorry. You seem very perturbed by this whole situation. May I ask you a few questions? Who is that?
2453.78 2469.22 speaker3  Who are you? No, we destroyed Mordant together. Well, yes, of course.
2468.90 2472.58 speaker2  Good.
2471.94 2495.70 speaker4  Yeah, all right. Okie dokie. Yeah, sure.
2490.50 2550.06 speaker3  with all sorts of strange equipment and kind of half-finished devices, inventions. You know, you're not quite sure. strange wiring on it. But the thing that attracts your attention the most is in the center of the room, you bolted to the floor is something that looks almost like a medieval torture device made of black iron. And there is something that is bolted within it. This strange, twisted, insectile-like thing, it has too many legs and it has claws and pincers and things sticking out of its head and its head is pulsating. You can't see any eyes. You can't even really see anything you can identify as a mouth. Do you want to give me a SAN roll?
2549.56 2556.84 speaker1  I do.
2555.16 2559.56 speaker3  Somehow you're taking this in your stride.
2557.96 2567.56 speaker4  Okay, all right.
2565.32 2591.56 speaker2  I have a question for you. is my thought of your goal.
2588.36 2600.20 speaker3  Release me now and you shall be spared it.
2598.60 2615.32 speaker2  And what is the end goal? My goal is to be released.
2610.60 2665.48 speaker3  There is this long pause as it is trying to process what the fuck you're saying. It's rattling this iron cage that it's stuck in. The other thing you can see now that you're a bit closer in talking to this is that it looks really badly hurt. A few of its limbs seem to be broken. There are wounds all over its carapace. It looks like it has wings, but the wings look damaged. But the worst of all is, yeah, this sort of brainy looking head that it's got covered in crenellations has got holes in it. It looks like holes have been drilled into its head. And you can see crusted around some of the holes, this sort of yellowish pus.
2663.00 2677.88 speaker2  Do you think that that would make you any less...
2676.68 2680.60 speaker4  Oh, fucking shit.
2679.56 2688.52 speaker2  Normal success.
2686.04 2692.76 speaker4  So what happens if your opponent bests you? Sorry?
2689.56 2702.92 speaker3  So what happens if your opponent bests you at this contest?
2699.96 2757.48 speaker2  Is this a monster or a mythos monster? It's a mythos monster. one's own mind. A human attempting to psychically attack a mythos monster must immediately make a sanity roll, taking the standard sanity loss as described in the monster's profile. So it means that you could take the same sanity roll twice for seeing them and then trying to connection.
2749.40 2817.64 speaker3  strange alien minds and moving through interstellar space and flying just through space, through all these places that the angles don't quite work right. I rolled a 94 on an 89. are no other player characters around. Summary rules for that. see what's happened.
2809.72 2821.64 speaker2  I like that we learned in real time that what you did was a horrible decision to think back
2817.64 2830.20 speaker4  on how much glee we had when you shouted psychic attack and the way that it ended up. Whoops, you've gone mad.
2827.72 2832.12 speaker2  And so you're just repeatedly trying to psychic attack.
2831.16 2842.60 speaker4  Oh God.
2835.00 2869.80 speaker3  Yeah, there's there's bits of burning debris all around now, which are lighting the courtyard quite nicely. And you can see that there are more of these flying creatures, some of them moving through the air. Some have landed on the roofs. You can see some scuttling in through windows on the manor house and the air around you is buzzing.
2867.48 2892.28 speaker2  thing in the wardrobe in the bedroom.
2889.48 2903.00 speaker5  that I was trying to peddle and it's happening now. Fuck.
2901.08 2922.60 speaker4  Hey, boss, I think it's time we get out of here.
2921.32 2931.00 speaker5  much better you are than him?
2929.08 2935.56 speaker2  you know, demons in the air.
2934.44 2952.44 speaker4  Demons in the air. Yeah, I'm following Lafayette's lead no matter what, but I think we're aiming for the house.
2948.92 2959.64 speaker3  Actually, each of you could give me a spot hidden roll on your way past if you want.
2957.24 2968.20 speaker4  That's the extreme, extreme success.
2965.24 2985.56 speaker3  seem to be relatively cleared of snow. In fact, it mostly seems to be the fronts of the cars. Now you look at it, the hoods are open and there are bits of engine just strewn all over the place. Oh, shit.
2983.64 3000.68 speaker4  Yeah, we ain't going anywhere in any of these.
2993.80 3059.32 speaker3  doors, you can see coming down the stairs at the far end of the hallway, there's a few of the staff who stopped and just looking. There's Margaret Payne. She's walking fairly slowly down the stairs and she is absolutely covered in blood with grey specks on her. She's got a thousand yard stare in her eyes and she's just swaying as she's coming down. He killed Cicero. He killed... stairs.
3056.92 3079.16 speaker2  And then he's gone and then I piss on his bed. Yeah, he says this with no eyeballs and no head.
3075.96 3098.76 speaker4  This is all in Lafayette's imagination as he's running up the stairs. I just loved your wife.
3098.20 3108.04 speaker2  Do it.
3103.56 3109.72 speaker3  probably more importantly, there is a trail of bloody footprints coming down the corridor
3108.04 3118.76 speaker2  from this room at the end. Yeah, that's what Checkers is going to be following.
3117.48 3163.08 speaker3  it looks a lot worse now. There is blood and brain and bits of skin and bone just splattered around the place And from down below you can hear this heavy clanking sound and something heavy falling you and you alone.
3155.24 3183.56 speaker2  Lafayette dips his finger in some of the blood on the wallpaper and takes a lick and he knows. He knows it's Cicero. It's cold. to do with his life.
3183.08 3190.68 speaker3  as well.
3189.48 3200.60 speaker2  I should probably start injecting.
3199.40 3213.48 speaker4  Having a rough night? Harvey standing over Morden's body.
3211.96 3216.76 speaker2  Well, this is good news, right?
3215.48 3222.28 speaker4  You win. You won. You won.
3218.76 3223.48 speaker2  I wanted to rub his nose in it and now he doesn't have one.
3222.92 3237.32 speaker4  Here, look. And I start to rub his skull. Rubbing his nose in it. That's lovely. That's the half of a skull.
3232.68 3294.68 speaker3  So it's just Checkers who's running downstairs and the other two of you are commiserating over Morden's corpse upstairs. heard outside. And sure enough, when you come around the corner, there is this battered form of this rise off the ground and there on the ground before it, kneeling almost in reverence, is the form of Mr. Ring. Mr. Ring is coming back to his senses now, I guess, but how this has affected you, how this glimpse of seeing something so much greater than yourself is shaping your thoughts at
3294.44 3311.16 speaker2  No. No, Mr. And I have a gun on me and I'm going to shoot this thing because it scares me.
3309.64 3336.84 speaker3  So, yeah, I mean, Mr. Ring, you can see that Checkers, your old master, is that right? Or is he still your current master? I mean, does he still have anything to teach you compared to the wonders you've just seen inside this creature's mind? Good point.
3329.96 3374.76 speaker2  It has completely tainted my soul, and I will now be known as Dark Soul. Wow.
3363.32 3380.76 speaker3  Soul can see Checkers pulling out this gun as this divine creature is beginning to rise up in the air.
3378.04 3403.24 speaker2  Checkers is just going to unload his gun. You were once my friend and my mentor.
3402.84 3475.88 speaker3  Exactly. seems angry. You can hear the timbre of its buzzing getting louder and the buzzing voice just fills the room, even over the deafening effect of the gunshots. And Mr. Soul can hear it just saying, Destroy him.
3473.08 3502.60 speaker2  same feeling that I got downstairs in the ballroom. 60. 44. Fuck you. I see the lack of effect that my bullets have made on this thing. And I look at Eldin and I change the aim of my gun because I can feel him attacking me again psychically.
3502.12 3509.96 speaker4  Wow.
3508.92 3511.16 speaker3  go up the stairs.
3510.52 3518.12 speaker2  Not at me.
3516.44 3521.24 speaker3  Pretty good plan on its part.
3519.08 3529.96 speaker2  It's not stupid.
3529.64 3546.68 speaker3  Soul?
3542.92 3563.80 speaker2  So I successfully shoot him. Yeah, like a 38 special.
3563.32 3595.48 speaker3  10. Your friend, your confidant, your leader, the man who defined your life. Defined your beliefs, defined your existence until a moment ago.
3594.84 3605.72 speaker2  That's fair enough.
3601.80 3608.44 speaker3  or is it more the emotional pain of having been shot by your mentor?
3607.56 3624.44 speaker2  Oh, I just got shot. Yes, physical pain hurts more. And as soon as I shoot him, I drop the gun and I'm like, why?
3621.80 3644.36 speaker3  If you're lucky, maybe not in the gut, in the stomach, but there's blood welling out from between his fingers now. Is Mr. Soul putting up with that? You've just been shot and now he's trying to tend to your wound.
3641.72 3684.92 speaker5  Why did you not join on the true side of... You got tricked. They got to you. I thought you were stronger than that. Well, on my way down, you don't know any of this, but on my way down the ladder, I thought about just whatever you're into, I was going to do. But then you tried to mind attack me again. You son of a bitch.
3683.40 3694.84 speaker4  Do you want to give me a first aid roll? I have four luck.
3692.52 3707.56 speaker2  Oh, I'll spend four luck to make that pass. Okay. Which puts me at eight.
3705.08 3724.92 speaker3  poured in a gunshot wound does you the world of good. Well, yeah, it's that.
3723.40 3747.32 speaker5  Former master checkers.
3743.16 3776.84 speaker2  past 20 minutes what's happened to his friend. Like he's just like shaking his head. Like what the fuck?
3770.84 3816.36 speaker3  Harvey and Lafayette can hear this buzzing sound from down below. Then there's gunshots. They're shouting. The buzzing sound is getting louder and louder as something comes bursting out of the wardrobe. Something very much like the things you saw outside. But this time you're now seeing it in bright light. You can see the twisted insectile form, the strange pincers, the pulsating head, the strange wounds all over it as it floats above the ground.
3815.72 3821.56 speaker4  You cannot.
3819.40 3840.44 speaker2  How many licks in the center of a sanity roll? I believe I passed. Let me get my sheet back up. Oh nope. 93 on an 89. I fail.
3839.64 3851.48 speaker3  That's more like it. Can I have an intelligence roll off Harvey, please? Yes, you can.
3851.00 3855.40 speaker4  Okay.
3853.32 3940.52 speaker3  So again, you get five points of Cthulhu Mythos. What do you think of them? Blind panic? Does that sound about right? So yeah, I mean in your panic to get out of the room, you're pushing Lafayette out of the way. The two of you are just stumbling all over each other and this creature actually doesn't seem to be paying you much attention. It just flies out of the room at speed. From beyond in the corridor and down the stairs, you can hear sounds. I mean, you heard a few sounds before, glass breaking and stuff like that. But now there are other sounds. There are people screaming and there's strange sounds like electrical discharge and just this buzzing, so much buzzing in the air, not just this thing that flew past you. But it's just like suddenly the air is absolutely filled with buzzing.
3937.24 3995.24 speaker2  It wasn't a zapper, it was going to draw them in like moths. Oh my God. There would have been thousands more. But they would have been over there. It's totally what it is.
3991.64 4128.92 speaker1  Hollow when you sang I thought you might be starving Brides and dry-baked clay Crocus blossoms in February And I lay home in May Time between a mother's fingers While waiting for a fix My voice is nothing now But the howl of the wind Come closer dear in my teeth Rattle in my jaw Rattle in my jaw
