0.00 145.76 speaker0  Welcome, babies one and all. Welcome, rabies one and all. Get them shots before you foam at the mouth. It's Wolf the Dog, here to administer your rabies medication live from 694.2 PTBB. I don't accept insurance, but I'll gladly accept your soul as payment. We wanted to give a few special shout-outs before we dip into this very special Plot Talk episode. Spoilers abound, y'all. First, check out our Reddit. It's filled with a fun community. You can find that at reddit.com r slash pretending to be people. You can find a link to the Discord in there somewhere. Come chat with us and hang out a little bit. I've heard some dummy named Justin has been trying to stream more often lately. And some of those other pretending to be people boys sometimes join in on the fun. And you know I'm always all about that. The point is that this episode is about discussing the finer points. What is the point? Where are we even? Where do we go when we sleep? Am I human after all? Probably not. finally figured out how to record from a distance at the scientist's insistence. So with no more resistance, I howl out for assistance from the tune that fuels this wolf's existence.
116.00 155.92 speaker1  5, 6, 7, clap.
153.04 161.76 speaker0  that I actually didn't think anyone else did it except me. I think it was perfect, yeah.
158.24 189.60 speaker1  Even the video aligned beautifully. But also when I'm editing these, it makes me sound like the Dumbo. Because if you're all set to this clap one, then you're all together. And I'm slightly off from you. So you say something and then I'm like... Anywho, I'll just match it up with the Zoom call and it'll all be good.
188.48 242.96 speaker0  Getting it figured out. How's everyone doing on this beautiful spring day? Real good. Good. Doing good. You gave me the power and it will never come back. Y'all just want to hop into some of these questions. We got a whole lot of them to get through today. No, that's okay if we don't want to. Oh, do you want, do we, should we do a description of what we're about to do today?
239.76 251.92 speaker1  Well, Luke and I are too busy changing our Zoom backgrounds. Yeah. Read this.
248.00 254.32 speaker2  Luke's is reminding me of playing enter the matrix and it really
252.64 269.12 speaker1  makes me want to bust out my PS2.
268.24 271.68 speaker2  Oh no. This is creepy.
270.00 274.32 speaker1  Is it actually a manifesto?
273.68 286.24 speaker2  Show my work.
284.96 292.88 speaker0  They're all alike.
292.00 298.08 speaker1  Tasteless. Thomas has a very, very cute Murphy behind him.
296.96 304.72 speaker0  Oh, I love him. I shouldn't say I love, we all love Murphy.
303.68 311.60 speaker2  I got quite a few. What's your favorite?
310.72 363.84 speaker0  That one's the best. Please get Ainsley. Eats the Hills. There we go. Thank you. There it is. Not a baby eats a boy. Yeah, don't be here right now.
363.12 371.68 speaker2  Fuck you.
367.92 380.80 speaker0  Spoilers you may not have even known existed before today.
374.48 407.52 speaker1  Basically what I'm going to reinforce here is going to be a look back at many of the things we've forgotten and then basically just like theories and opinions from each of the players on what is happening and what their plans are moving forward. Luke just vaped in against the zoom green screen. It looked fucking awesome.
403.36 413.12 speaker0  what NPCs besides Drew do you trust the most?
412.48 414.88 speaker2  Daily. Gary Daily.
413.76 420.40 speaker1  That's a really good answer.
418.88 433.52 speaker2  Harry clinker of clinkers. Uh, clinker, right? Because it was in his daycare.
429.68 434.32 speaker1  It wasn't his daycare, but it was his partner Gary Daily.
433.52 452.88 speaker2  Okay, cool. Yeah, that's my answer. Yeah, that's a, that's a good dude.
447.52 517.76 speaker1  Thomas, you actually asked the question when I had you guys ask questions and I would answer them in dreams for you, uh, in which I really didn't answer the questions, but, uh, just made weird fucked up dreams surrounding the idea of your question. You asked if you could trust Gary Daily and Harry clinker. Yeah. And you also saw like his grandpa. You later confirmed in a phone call on the way to the city.
511.60 537.92 speaker2  And, uh, uh, until recently, I think, uh, Leon was high on his trust list and maybe he's questioning that a little more these days, but yeah, a lot of, a lot of trust in Maggie for sure. I don't think that he has a, a lot of mistrust in them right now.
537.60 543.84 speaker1  Yeah. Oh, uh, my niece, my niece, for sure.
543.28 565.84 speaker2  Your niece. bigger than blood.
560.56 571.20 speaker0  Um, this next one comes from the lay suit for the boys. That's how I would say it.
569.68 591.28 speaker1  Oh, I wouldn't. Yeah. Like a, like a leisure Jesuit. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. Oh, my mom was a leisure Jesuit. Oh, I'll say.
588.96 597.44 speaker0  And what are some of your favorite bangs?
596.96 600.24 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah.
598.24 614.32 speaker1  That was, that was all about the roles though. Kinda. Yeah.
610.72 638.32 speaker2  within like five minutes of each other. Also, did we ever follow up on the note you got from the robot guy? Not really. That's one too. What did it say?
633.44 649.36 speaker0  that was really funny that John Lee Fattimore was in love with a robot and got a massage
648.80 650.88 speaker1  Yeah.
649.36 657.52 speaker2  You got to think about that.
653.36 675.44 speaker1  I mean, you're not going to be metal, you know, if you're made from massaging, you're going to have to come up with some very, very human like parts to get in there.
674.80 682.88 speaker2  Exactly.
682.56 718.72 speaker1  Yes. And it says, I killed the, oh wait, sorry. Do you know it, Joe? Word for word in binary.
715.12 722.72 speaker2  We, we kind of got it and tucked it away and never really researched it. I would have liked to have known more about it. Who has the helmet now?
722.16 732.80 speaker0  Oh, fuck.
731.12 733.36 speaker1  Well, it made a whole lot of noise.
732.80 738.96 speaker2  Ironic.
737.60 776.40 speaker1  But yeah, for sure. The, uh, the helmet would have been interesting. It was just on, um, you know, Luke and Keith Vigna and pastor Adam Kane. Not liking, uh, each other pretty, pretty clearly.
770.48 784.24 speaker2  I was a big fan the very first time we ever saw a creepy picture come out of that Polaroid camera. I don't know if you consider that a bang or not. That's pretty integral to the story, but it came out for sure. Cool.
781.84 837.12 speaker1  That's like a set charge, right? It's like when they use this, this will happen. It's like, I love doing this with people and locations once we're like into the game to be like, it's up to them if they want to make this happen, but if they reach out to this person, this will unlock this plot essentially. It's like, if you happen to decide to call someone, then you're going to make something happen there because you're not just going to call them and have nothing be happening, right? Something will be happening, but if you don't call them, it's up to me to decide at that point, like, well, what happened? Is it still this interesting convoluted story or would that not be as interesting because they weren't there for it? I always want you guys there for the action.
831.04 853.76 speaker2  So I don't know if this was a bang probably, but when Keith snuck on the bus and then all the homeless people got on and I was stuck on it and you guys know what happened. That was pretty good.
849.52 880.32 speaker1  It's like, these people are going to do this and these are their objectives and this is how they're going to do it. And then you got into the exact bus that they were going to leave on. hooking you? ground by the unseen forces. Ooh, fuck.
879.76 888.64 speaker0  Yeah. That was a disturbing imagery moment that I personally loved. Yes.
888.08 940.88 speaker1  That's awesome. That was one of those things where I don't plan a lot in advance for like how things are going to play out. I did not expect Clark to critically succeed on a firearms check and kill her. Old eagle eye Bishop. You know it. We got a next question here from super five-ish. Super fish or super fish with a five is a F is super five-ish says what happened to the grammar, poor torch-wielding would be invaders hinted at in the early episodes. Are they still kicking about? And this is, uh, this is in the, one of those pictures that you were talking about there,
937.52 956.64 speaker2  I think he's referencing the note that we got it because when he said grammar poor, it says we are striking with darkness, reading torches, hesitate, not, um, and it says, are they still kicking about? I don't, I don't know. I assume it has something to do with the picture we saw of people holding torches, but I don't know.
956.08 962.08 speaker1  Yeah. I completely misread that question.
958.72 969.44 speaker2  I had to think about it when they, when they said grammar poor, I was like, who was grammar poor?
968.56 992.56 speaker1  looked like they didn't know. So any ideas? I, we got a question about that now. Let's just jump to it now. Where is it? A non a no, no, no asks when that cloud portal yeeted John Peters at the boy's car, where was he thrown from? Is that the place the spooky picture depicts?
991.60 1010.96 speaker2  I like to think so. Cause we had seen John Peters in the stocks in those pictures and it was that inky black void. So I fear he, if he was there and then not there, maybe he got spit out, but no, there's nothing being confirmed one way or the other. What's your computer notes say, Zach?
1010.32 1054.64 speaker1  Oh fuck. Come up with something. It just, I'm looking at the answer. Do you guys want me to screen share with you? I've got a question here from the leisure for me or for someone who's got a name that sounds like mine, but is spelled differently. It's for Zach with a K from the original timeline slash campaign slash thing. What dangling hooks do you wish the boys would have followed up on? Yeah, I'd probably say the grammar poor torch wielding would be invaders hinted at in the early episode.
1051.04 1074.32 speaker2  we couldn't like go back and follow up on if we really felt the need to. That's absolutely correct. Things might've changed since we first saw it, but there's no reason we couldn't go and do a little more research on something. to the woods. Don't fuck up this time.
1072.88 1103.36 speaker1  Well now I've got to change it. Oh, just edit that part out. Also, what about Jan Manstein and Stan Manstein for that matter? Why could the only the boys understand Stan at the meaner? Yeah, the fuck me. And what does he mean by our past is different?
1102.56 1143.36 speaker2  I've got a theory. I don't know. What's your theory? Stan obviously seems super important. He was telling us a lot of really good info before we tried to kill him, but he was talking about how pasts have changed and so I mean there's some kind of timey wimey thing that for some reason we're all sure that we remember different names for Ari. He kind of alluded to the fact that that's not going to happen anymore that she's a fixed point in some way and that his his life is definite or her life is definite now. I don't know, but he seemed to know a lot about how all this timey wimey shit is working and I don't really grasp it all, but it seems super important. I agree.
1140.72 1153.52 speaker1  I want you all to answer it on the count of three. Who is the dentist in contention? Do you have an answer in your mind?
1152.96 1155.68 speaker2  Yeah.
1155.12 1157.92 speaker0  Old man.
1157.28 1194.08 speaker2  Moller? the estate right of James. what we gathered from his card. Yeah. What was his name?
1192.16 1207.84 speaker1  Was it another Andrews sibling? No, his name was Randy Angst. Randy Angst. The guy who was at James the mill worker's house with you guys.
1207.36 1217.92 speaker2  Yeah. Yeah.
1213.28 1232.48 speaker1  in town, Dr. Moller, and then you met a dentist named Randy Angst. Write that down. That's just a thing that happened.
1228.48 1236.72 speaker2  a state and his card had like four different occupations on it. Yeah, I agree.
1234.40 1337.04 speaker1  Thomas, do you have any theories about Ari Manstein? One of the finest cops I ever knew. I think I got a question here from crane song. Zach, what was the decision made by the players that stands out to you as the most derailing what you had planned? We know that you parenthetical allegedly. Had to rewrite the campaign after someone Thomas joked about it being the mine. Were there any other parts of the campaign that had to be redone? Any really, really, really obvious plot points that the players bypassed or previously pivotal characters that were either killed or ignored? Control H, baby. So yeah, that was Thomas who did the mine thing. And that was when I was still writing the story and I was like, yeah, you're right. I shouldn't make it that. Um, but, um, like rewritten, uh, constantly, I would, yeah, I rewrite stuff literally all the time. If you guys do something to affect my plan, then I have to rewrite everything. And that happens like every single time we sit down to play. Cause you guys are fun to play with, you make choices. And that's the thing that matters most in role-playing is, uh, we're making the story together. So every time you make a choice, I get to play with that choice.
1334.08 1339.44 speaker2  And that's why I like role-playing I'm with you.
1338.80 1350.40 speaker1  Yeah. All right. So we've got a question here.
1348.48 1359.36 speaker2  I was about to tell Joe to write it down.
1358.48 1363.04 speaker1  killed part. Like, yeah, for sure.
1361.60 1372.48 speaker0  Got a murderous crew.
1370.48 1392.80 speaker1  to end in his murder. with at city state university.
1392.32 1438.64 speaker0  Oh boy. We got one from a non, uh, no, no, no. thrown from? Is that the place the spooky picture depicts? We did this one. Oh, well, thanks. Just wanted to share things. And what happened to those kids that, that saw the gooey vacuum? Thanks. There were no kids.
1436.80 1479.20 speaker2  That's not a, that's not a thing. No, we wouldn't have done that. That's ridiculous. No, they died. That's I can't believe I wasn't involved in that one.
1476.96 1490.56 speaker1  and John told that whole story. With Keith in the car and Doug Jacobs in the body of agent Trent and Chad also in the car.
1488.88 1495.04 speaker2  That he was dreaming it or something. Yeah. Yeah.
1494.08 1498.24 speaker1  And he's like, no, no, no. They just talk to each other like this all the time.
1497.76 1508.32 speaker2  Yeah.
1506.32 1563.84 speaker0  for audio formatting purposes. Ain't on a no, no, no, no. No, they commented. Are we talking a specific yellow sign? TM J state comments back. I think so. I'm doing a quarantine release. And when the art Gary has on the walls of the restaurant is described, it kind of sounds like one is the yellow sign, not a yellow sign, if you know what I mean, but it could be some other occult symbol. I'm not familiar with.
1558.64 1575.04 speaker2  And one of them definitely sounds like a yellow sign description, but none of our characters would know that like, there's no way that they would know that is what that is.
1568.40 1597.84 speaker1  I bet John Lee Pettymore saw like the first 30 minutes of the first season of true detective and didn't get it and turned it off. They can look like anything. So, but there is one that looks a whole heck of a lot.
1594.96 1611.68 speaker2  Yeah, it does. Doesn't it?
1609.68 1621.84 speaker1  a land unknown.
1617.52 1641.76 speaker2  kind of like it was a question mark with a line coming out the other side and yada, yada, yada. signs. And I was like, huh? But now I realize nothing to do with that. Speaking of nothing. Okay.
1640.88 1679.12 speaker0  Look out world. Sorry. Um, okay. They wrote a question I actually was curious about too. What happened to the FBI agents who visited the contention PD and said they'd be in contact within 48 hours and Maladory followed up? Weren't the agents at the den of sin when Marvin got terminated or were those different agents?
1678.56 1732.80 speaker2  That's for sure. Part of it. Yeah. Yeah. And it just was like, thank you. Have a good day. So that thread kind of ended. And then, yeah, as far as the den of sin goes, I think that's what I'm operating under is that that was them that we saw in the audience going into Marvin's room. And I think I brought up with you guys that we don't know for sure what the fuck that means. That could mean that they are on Marvin's payroll maybe, or they had followed us into the glass compound and we're trying to help. I don't know. I don't know what they were doing there.
1724.16 1744.24 speaker1  And their goal in front of your eyes, like what you saw was them get rid of silver or not even get rid of, but just put one silver ball that none of them were touching into the Nike bag.
1740.16 1752.16 speaker2  Maybe the Nike bag teleported it to glass.
1749.76 1800.32 speaker1  I think we might've done it off the podcast one day. Oh yeah. think it's right before the entity shows up to yell at Clark Bishop about the book. And you guys are all standing in the mausoleum courtyard, essentially, and just talking about the plot for the entire time. And the overview of that episode is just like intense plot point after intense plot point after intense plot point after intense plot point. So yeah, if you want to go for listeners 34, if you want to go back and listen to them, try to figure some stuff out before we hop into this. I mean, I know that's what this is, but damn, that episode is chock full of shit. Nice. All right.
1796.80 1820.72 speaker0  Moving right along crush 36 rights. Who do the robots work for? a ring and stuff.
1820.08 1874.16 speaker2  It's myriad. It stands for myriad, which is a company that I think creates androids. The, it was in operation stapler that they were like cutting costs on androids. Yeah. So yeah, I don't, did we find out who myriad was or what they were, what they were associated with? When we were in the office, he saw your ring and was like, oh, he, did he have one on two? Cause I tried to like touch them together. I think. Or am I making that up?
1872.80 1888.40 speaker1  I don't have an overview for that one. You should get on that.
1883.44 1900.40 speaker2  It's our job to write some of these overviews and we suck at doing that on time. We're like half the season behind.
1899.92 1901.04 speaker1  Shit.
1900.40 1903.52 speaker2  Which one?
1902.08 1909.12 speaker1  So it was way more in depth.
1906.48 1916.64 speaker2  I put on only the good stuff in there.
1911.20 1928.48 speaker0  Oh, Joe's putting a lot of fluff in those overviews. He's putting up his font size. He's not paying us by the word, Joe.
1926.96 1952.56 speaker2  It was the best of soads. So if he says like her grimacing face, I'm going to put in that grimacing just in case that means something later.
1948.96 1959.12 speaker1  And then graveyard boys, robots or glass type dudes. They weren't fish, if that was what the question was.
1956.48 1964.08 speaker2  Did we ever investigate their bodies?
1961.52 1979.60 speaker1  like alien creature kind of things, right? The long, tall, like lanky gray entity that like, and wearing a full suit screamed at Clark.
1977.44 1995.36 speaker2  It screamed at me and I didn't know what the fuck.
1994.48 2002.48 speaker1  They look very similar.
1998.40 2007.04 speaker2  They don't act the same at all though, which is an important distinction.
2002.48 2016.56 speaker1  They certainly don't, but they also probably aren't human based on those descriptions that I gave. Not a lot of eight foot tall humans walking around.
2014.48 2045.52 speaker2  Not a lot, Zach, but they're out there. There are some. Enough.
2044.72 2103.84 speaker1  Oh boy. Speaking of, we got a question from Jayhawk Inc. More from him later or her them later. Are there any things that have quote official names that haven't been named as such in the podcast? Yes. Like I don't remember the chanting fish men being called deep ones. They weren't. And they discovered that trove of weapons, but only Joe mentioned that it was likely a green box out of character. I'm curious if we've like seen a ghoul. No, but didn't realize it was a ghoul. No, because no one called it that, you know? Yeah, probably no ghouls, but maybe. I don't know. I like to make ghouls look different than traditional ghouls. I used ghouls heavily in a former campaign. Eight foot tall. He like woke up with like with like graveyard dirt all over him one night
2102.24 2113.36 speaker2  and was like, what's going on?
2111.04 2140.56 speaker0  Maladory has one for us. If ball contains consciousness of some people, how did it have John Pettymore the third's original body? Also, how come some ball seems to act with intelligence when they take a body and some kill themselves or go berserk? That's a question about ball.
2139.20 2168.80 speaker2  And this is one that I wrote. I still don't know anything about ball. Yeah, exactly. I don't know for sure if I'm ball or not, but it's been implied for sure. I don't know what that would mean for me or not for me. I don't know much about ball at all. I don't know how though. It seems like ball central was Marvin Glass's compound.
2167.68 2170.80 speaker0  Let's head on back, boys.
2169.36 2184.80 speaker2  We can still go.
2182.48 2189.52 speaker1  was it the FBI agents before they got killed?
2188.24 2193.52 speaker0  this will only take two hours. And then all the university shit happened.
2192.40 2202.56 speaker2  Yeah, I don't think so. It's like the mill. Zach doesn't want us to do that.
2199.92 2221.46 speaker1  When I was reading back over the overview, I noted in one of the overviews that I wrote early on and said, they chose not to go to the mill. Wow.
2220.26 2227.86 speaker0  No, no, that was perfect. I have tons of plot ball thoughts, but you know,
2225.30 2289.70 speaker2  can we, can we real fast think about all the balls we've seen? For real though, I know the first one it was in, it was in the potential green box in a tub that was filled with gore. And when we opened it, it was a woman's head in the middle of it, split open with a ball sitting in the middle of it. So that was our first encounter with ball. Ball one. Is that the ball that you had in your pocket, Thomas? When we, when we brought them the Nike bag, they brought their own ball out of their pocket and popped it into the bag. And we didn't tell them that we already had a ball. I don't think. So that's two balls we know of now. Third ball would be whatever John himself is, right? He or was the ball in his pocket. What became him? Do we know that? I don't know if my character knows that and it's been said, I don't know. So we don't have to say motherfucker.
2288.42 2294.42 speaker0  You, you did, right?
2292.58 2302.82 speaker2  And then you were like, I think we're all ball. I'm pretty sure that conversation happened at the cemetery.
2301.06 2316.90 speaker1  and that's, that's how I became ball. That would, that'd be big news.
2315.22 2355.78 speaker2  Do we know the origin of that ball? Do we know if that was, came out of John's pocket maybe when we were last there? They tried to get them to touch the ball and it would come kill them. So it seemed like maybe that ball had been there for a while. Cause they had tapes and tapes and tapes of kids getting, it would rip their spines out or tear them apart, right?
2351.78 2368.82 speaker1  own head into the wall until they fell. pulled up the body of John Wayne Pennymore.
2367.70 2380.10 speaker2  Oh yeah, that's right.
2375.46 2395.94 speaker1  has enough real-time past that you'll let me listen to those episodes, Zach? Yeah.
2390.66 2402.02 speaker2  Also, I'm wearing a pair of, I'm wearing a pair of MeUndies right now and they're super comfortable.
2398.18 2412.66 speaker0  My mattress isn't a Casper mattress, but boy, do I wish it was.
2411.22 2427.22 speaker2  you could get 15% off. Long coupon. All right. I got a bag of chips I need to eat.
2425.62 2471.94 speaker0  Oh, did you guys talk about the homeless people? No, you skipped one. Oh, did I? Oh, shit. Sorry. Okay. Our favorite fan, Crush 36 writes, JK. Crush 36. Oh, it sounds bad no matter what I do. What was up with all the homeless people? I feel like I remember some call back to them later, but it's not stuck in my head like the other major plot points. I can take this one. We found out all about them.
2463.62 2538.82 speaker2  At Glass's facility, we rescued Kathy Piston and she kind of filled us in that she was trafficking those homeless people to both the Circle of Knowledge and Marvin Glass. Did you say you rescued her? Well, we took her down off the hook and talked to her for a while. She kept sniping dudes down and then a sickle got her right to the... That's right. you guys didn't know. And we did talk about this in the Circle that I told you guys, I know that the Circle of Knowledge uses homeless people to keep the evil thing that I saw at bay. What's Marvin using them for? And she told us that he uses them for fights and that's all she knows and that she always got the Circle of Knowledge homeless guys back in good, healthy shape. Whereas the Marvin Glass guys came back, beat up and spent.
2533.54 2584.66 speaker1  Luke was just talking about seeing those videos of the experiments done with ball. Gotcha. And I believe it was evident that those were the people being used in those experiments were the kids. Orphan, no animals. Yeah, just orphans. Like poor ol' Walter. I wore my underwear underneath my polio blanket. Cool. Are they me undies? I've got a plug. Does Casper... I believe not. That was, yeah, very succinct.
2577.22 2592.66 speaker2  When we crashed his church, we went down into that cafeteria area. And I think that you describe that crowd as a homeless-looking crowd. I always knew there was something off about that guy.
2590.18 2596.42 speaker1  I got the feeling he was like a middleman or something between. Yeah, maybe.
2595.62 2597.54 speaker2  He's like, I'll feed him.
2596.42 2609.22 speaker1  You transport him. I'll Jesus him.
2607.62 2629.16 speaker2  It's like a kind of nice thought. I mean, he didn't try to stop it from happening. Yeah, he seemed like that kind of guy. Okay, express train to heaven.
2628.66 2651.94 speaker0  Yeah.
2651.22 2655.62 speaker1  Running all day.
2654.02 2662.50 speaker2  Laser beam in my dream.
2658.18 2686.50 speaker1  The chicken train one, or you got another episode here from Maladory. No, I, we, Oh, I'm so excited to start playing again, but that is for the end of this.
2684.02 2698.18 speaker2  Maladory on like five or six more Q and A's.
2692.82 2728.26 speaker1  What was with the weird tree arm trap and mirror that threw a spear? The only acting forces we see are K cell black goo and ball. None of them really seem like trap people. That's presumptuous and K cell burns the cabin. So they weren't using it. What does that mean? What do you guys think that means? It was the witch.
2720.98 2753.46 speaker2  So if you remember back to Stan Manstein's monologue, he talked about how Silas Cole discovered the ooze and then became an inventor. When I went into the cabin, I found plans for the gun and a bunch of tubes of ooze. So I wonder if it has something to do with Silas Cole. Maybe it was his laboratory or something, but the time thing is all crazy. I don't know how any of that works out, but that's been my theory for a while now that that has something to do with it.
2750.50 2760.34 speaker1  Can I remind you of something else that you saw in the cabin? It was paperwork for Cole's orphanage.
2759.06 2764.10 speaker2  Right, right, right, right.
2762.50 2770.26 speaker1  Further strengthening the coal ties. Perhaps. I mean, it was just named after him, so who knows. Was it named after him or his wife?
2768.90 2858.98 speaker2  What was Mary Cole? There was something that was named for Mary Cole. Do we remember what that was? I believe the library. That's been my theory. I don't know anything really about how the traps or mirrors or weird tree and all that stuff worked or if, I don't know. I don't know any of it. That's just been what I've, the two dots that I've connected myself. What do you guys think the cabin was? I got freed by the agents or whatever, but then I got killed, so I don't know. I don't know much about them. I don't really know, though, especially like the, I don't think, I don't think the weird tree thing was like a trap necessarily. I think it was more like supernatural. Studied it. Any other thoughts on the traps?
2856.90 2902.74 speaker1  a room that I don't think anybody else went into. On the inside of the moat with the cabin, there was like a storage. Oh, was it all the dead orphans? It was a lot of dead bodies without their spines that were hanging like on racks with a closet full of their clothes. That's so spooky, which is why I must have blocked it out.
2897.62 2954.12 speaker2  I will say when I went back and listened to those, I was super incredibly frustrated that when I went into that room with the plans for the gun, you were like, there's these ooze like coffin things and there's these paperwork and there's these diagrams. And I investigated all of those, but you also said there's a chest in the corner. And there's a wooden trunk. Never, it never got brought up again. I totally forgot to check into it. There could have been something cool inside. I wonder, I think that that was why I decided not to check it out is because I thought I knew what it was, but to have not actually said, let's open that bad boy up.
2953.62 2967.86 speaker0  Nope. And you shouldn't be putting your arm inside of a weird monster tree that desires flesh.
2966.18 2972.50 speaker1  You just did it so quick. I mean, it's funny.
2968.90 2977.54 speaker2  It's funny looking back, but it was like you said a loop trap.
2974.82 2980.74 speaker1  Almost as if what does this button do?
2978.34 2991.46 speaker2  Whatever happened to our naked raccoon friend? Oh, right.
2990.50 3009.22 speaker1  Uh, I'll Google it.
3007.14 3016.58 speaker2  And 10 to 15 years old as a pet. Oh wow.
3015.46 3020.18 speaker1  Uh, split the diff.
3018.98 3024.02 speaker2  That's what Google says.
3023.06 3083.30 speaker1  Human inside. Yeah. I accidentally Googled how long do raccoons. So they, uh, Jay Hawk Inc asked any of the side story characters that could show up in the main story or the inverse, like the boys getting to explore the calm, comfy campgrounds. Uh, yeah, I, um, I made plans a while ago for the calm, comfy campgrounds in case you guys wanted to go there as far as side stories showing up in the main story. Um, it's all main story, baby. I know like some of them are in the past, but this is all one big story. That's all interconnected. So it's all main story. So they could all show up anywhere if they're still alive or if they're not, maybe, uh, Jay Hawk Inc also says, I think I'm going to make one of my social distancing projects, quote, re-listen and fill out the Wiki.
3082.18 3091.54 speaker2  Good luck indeed.
3084.90 3141.38 speaker1  Uh, I'll send you the overviews of the episodes if you want help with doing that. I don't follow on Twitter for some reason, do it that pretending prod on Twitter and didn't even know we had a discord until it was mentioned in the last episode. How dare you? How did I not know we had a discord? explicitly shouted it out on the show? I don't know. And the more people join, the more likely for it to be not awesome anymore. Oh, it's, it's easy.
3138.90 3146.50 speaker0  You just ban them when they're dumb immediately. Shout out to crush 36.
3144.42 3192.82 speaker1  Shout out to pretending to be Justin. Mod it up boys. We got another question. This one's a fun one. Guys, lighten up. You're taking this way too seriously. This is a fun one. Zach decides is covered by quote, the boys were put under quarantine like we are today. Assuming that for some reason, contention PD is not considered an essential service, which I love. Oh, don't give that option to them. Would they ignore a statewide stay at home order? That's unfortunate. We know the answer.
3192.58 3199.30 speaker0  Yeah. But unfortunately, you know, John Lee Pennymore would.
3195.14 3269.78 speaker1  I know the first thing that would come out of your mouth is that John Lee Pennymore wouldn't Such an idiot. I know. And there's this dude I know on Facebook, the shit he's posted about COVID is like, definitely what the kind of media like John Lee Pennymore would consume. So just like true stuff. Uh, he might be that kind of like prepper conspiracy theorist who's like, kind of been waiting for this, but he also just has like a lot of land. So he's probably out there just like shooting guns all day and riding around on like a four Wheeler and watching his DVDs. Any existential crisis inside John Lee Pennymore about enjoying the quarantine?
3266.82 3288.50 speaker2  He just wouldn't be going to work, but he'd still be at home. Uh, maybe he'd break out his old jigsaw puzzles and, uh, he might, uh, he might teach himself how to cook, not a TV dinner. He might learn to boil an egg.
3285.86 3292.74 speaker0  He gets a chef's hat with one notch in it.
3291.78 3305.54 speaker1  What about Keith Vigna?
3300.18 3317.30 speaker2  around the city the whole day, basically ignoring that he's not essential and just to have some sort of authority. That's worse than John's.
3315.22 3331.54 speaker1  Yeah, except for the Facebook share. handing out tickets.
3330.10 3346.74 speaker2  Yeah, exactly.
3340.90 3348.42 speaker1  You could also just like maybe fuck off to like another time until things get like, I'm
3346.74 3354.58 speaker2  going to where the garbage is.
3353.70 3364.34 speaker0  What would Drew be doing? Would he be working on his, uh, his YouTube channel?
3363.14 3457.86 speaker1  He lives alone. So he would get really, really lonely. And every day that went by without a zoom call, uh, or even the request for, uh, any sort of friendship would lead him to slowly stop enjoying the things that he previously liked, like playing Minecraft. Shit does that, I just remembered that Drew and John are millionaires. sort of worker strikes, uh, in order to feel fine about ordering from Amazon. And meanwhile, he's just got like maps of different cities up on his wall and stats, uh, for how many potential youths lives can be changed with the money that he's bringing in for each city, uh, trying to decide where he can do the most good.
3456.74 3474.42 speaker0  And a boy. Good job, Drew.
3472.74 3483.54 speaker2  So much bubble wrap.
3480.02 3487.06 speaker0  The only music Drew listens to is ASMR Youtubers.
3486.34 3536.42 speaker1  Bubble wrap. They're all about me and the things that I am going to say. So I want you guys to ask me these questions as fast as you can. And don't decide who goes first or who goes next, but please go as fast as you can.
3531.14 3546.66 speaker2  BazingaBegins asks, who are the four skeleton boys on the PTP logo supposed to be? Do they have one-to-one analogs in the story? Which came first, the story or the logo?
3545.22 3572.58 speaker1  And, oh, fuck. What's the last one? I'm blanking. I'm blanking so hard. A cop. It's a cop with a mustache. A one-to-one analogs in the story. No. Which came first, the story or the logo? The story. But the logo, while not one-to-one analogs is definitely, I chose them for a reason based on the whole story that we're telling. So get ready.
3568.82 3583.14 speaker0  Like there was a school bus full of homeless people, but I'm not sure where they all came from. How many people work at Contingent PD?
3578.74 3598.26 speaker1  And four people, five people work at Contingent PD. No, six. The three of you, Drew, Maggie, and Ray, Ari, Tim, Florence.
3596.34 3604.66 speaker2  Am I imagining that or is it so? It is very important.
3604.10 3621.30 speaker1  for later. So I have to keep the same descriptions of either what they're wearing or what they look like every time they pop back up or most of the time when they pop back up, depending on how subtle I'm trying to be. Nice.
3620.50 3631.94 speaker2  background? Any chance of turning this into an official module for Delta Green?
3628.82 3658.98 speaker1  book and I'm willing to put it in if we can make it happen. But our Patreon would have to be at a higher level and we'd also have to get Delta Green behind us to publish it. But if they don't want to publish it and the money's there, I will definitely spend the time to write this thing out into a full book and get illustrators and do maps for every building and everything and it would be fucking awesome and I would love to do that.
3652.98 3667.78 speaker0  How many clues did the group miss or misinterpret before the ding was edited in after correct guesses?
3664.26 3677.06 speaker1  role-playing works constantly and that's what makes it so much fun. The ding was only in like one or two episodes and it was for fun.
3676.50 3678.58 speaker2  the left?
3677.06 3698.74 speaker1  I dream about it every night. I love Last Podcast on the left. Everyone should tweet at Last Podcast on the left and be like, hey, you guys don't have a role-playing podcast on the Last Podcast network. Maybe you should have one. And then mention us. Don't forget about that part. Next.
3697.62 3719.54 speaker2  campaign, i.e. how many episodes did you think season one would be? 40 episodes tops, whole thing.
3717.62 3730.18 speaker1  it added after the initial plans.
3729.86 3738.90 speaker0  Yes.
3736.98 3748.90 speaker2  They just vanished from the story?
3742.18 3757.94 speaker1  The radio and the helmet are in the contention evidence locker and the gun and the camera
3756.02 3764.98 speaker2  if it had been remembered at the time?
3762.98 3783.70 speaker1  I think that's the story of the podcast. Thomas, read that last one. Hold on.
3781.62 3784.82 speaker0  Sorry, when you said last one, I went to the last one.
3783.70 3826.34 speaker1  We got to keep saying speed round. Speed round. How many have there been so far in your opinion and where are the breaks roughly? You read that so well and I really appreciated you doing that. Like your cadence was perfect and your voice- Speed round. I'm just curious. I think it'd be fun. Bazinga begins. What counts as a story arc on the show? That was so impressive.
3821.30 3831.38 speaker2  Should we all, at the same time, all at the same time as fast as we can?
3829.54 3840.66 speaker0  What counts as a story arc on the show? The past two episodes mentioned that season one has three more arcs left.
3839.54 3850.74 speaker2  I fumbled a few words.
3847.78 3934.42 speaker1  No, so there have been seven arcs so far. There are three left. That'll be 10 total. Episodes one through 14 was the start to the FBI agents leaving contention. Episodes 15 to 25 is the next arc. Flashbacks of their past to the officers leaving contention. Episodes 26 through 35 is them going to the city to chanting inside Ari Manstein's mausoleum, which is where we've, you know, the end of where we've reset to. And then 37 to 46 was the glass compound in Planet Juggernaut. 47 to 53 was the woods in the past. 54 to 64 was the numbers in City State University. And 66 to 72 is calm comfy campground, also in the past. That is the end of that. Yes. I am personally a big fan of scatter, but I can't fault anyone who enjoys a good box plot. I like a good one. Everyone answer on the count of three. One, two, three. Absolutely. Yeah, no doubt for sure. That is the end of the speed round. I think we nailed it so fast.
3931.54 3946.18 speaker2  I can't wait to listen to us all ask the question at the same time. It's my favorite part of the episode.
3941.94 3987.46 speaker1  recently and the town having turned against the CPD because of the non-denomination specific pastor, is anyone there left around or is it mostly just the people in the city? Did anyone actually make it out or was everyone gobbled up by the old goo monster? Curious as to what your guys's thoughts are on the matter. Just he doesn't have a denomination.
3982.90 4025.22 speaker2  I think Drew has told us that it seems dead around the city or around contention. If we've done our jobs right. In the last numbers arc, the city university arc, did we, we tried to call Drew a few times, didn't we? And it just kept going to voicemail? Yeah. Okay. So go, going back to that last question, probably not then.
4022.82 4041.06 speaker0  three contention PD officers?
4036.74 4091.22 speaker2  Just because we've gone, we started at zero and we've gone through so much crazy shit together that like, I'm a little more understanding about you doing fucked up shit in this world now. Probably for Keith it has. Yeah. It's been hours since I've been a truly pathetic police officer.
4085.94 4101.54 speaker0  Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from you? Any theories about the other characters that you aren't sure of, but you're willing to share? So don't answer that one right now.
4101.06 4117.06 speaker2  Can you hear me? Don't do it. Yeah.
4115.38 4141.62 speaker0  Break a piece off of you, Joe.
4138.34 4153.22 speaker1  characters while, uh, who's going to pee first. No way. Three.
4152.34 4203.86 speaker2  No, you're not going to pull. Four. Four? And this is the one I'm drinking right now. Those are the three Coke Zero I drank. Oh, nice. Yeah, it makes me have to pee and poop all the time though. So, bye.
4202.50 4207.54 speaker3  All right, I'm going to sing.
4205.22 4222.82 speaker2  Cause I can hear what you guys say in the bathroom.
4222.18 4254.90 speaker1  Bye. Bye. Oh, that's fun. I didn't think about that.
4253.78 4256.90 speaker0  He's gone. Oh no.
4256.18 4261.70 speaker3  All right. Let's bring him back.
4260.98 4266.34 speaker2  Oh God.
4264.34 4281.54 speaker0  There's nothing on the other side. Somebody Thomas changed his name to mommy.
4280.90 4287.06 speaker3  I like that. What's up, Joe?
4285.54 4305.06 speaker1  You're the only one who's here. I've got a question for you.
4301.38 4325.38 speaker2  It was, uh, the woman that killed Clark's parents. And I kind of wish I would have, it would have dawned on me at the time in role-playing, but the little girl who I think we're assuming is Maggie now came
4324.66 4330.66 speaker1  reacted. Yeah.
4326.42 4337.62 speaker2  But yeah, it, after the fact, I, it kind of, it, uh, it all, it all came around full circle too.
4336.98 4364.74 speaker1  what? Yeah, you nailed it.
4364.26 4397.94 speaker2  Love that. actually saw Ann in the circle of knowledge room when he very first was brought there. He saw a glimpse of her as a door shut closed. So another reason I should have picked up on the fact that she was running in the circle of knowledge crew.
4394.42 4417.46 speaker1  being at her hearing and her pulling a double homicide. And admitting to it on the stand. One might've assumed that she would not be free to go wherever she pleased.
4416.66 4427.54 speaker2  Did that not happen? Did that not happen? Yeah. It's real, it's real, real wild for him.
4425.86 4461.62 speaker1  you're not paying attention.
4457.38 4472.58 speaker0  What info can you give us that we know about them, but might not have stuck in? All the best letters got me emotionally. And I hope Clark finds some closure there.
4467.46 4510.90 speaker2  So early on, we mentioned that we gave Zach the free reign to do whatever he wants to our characters' backstories. And he's done exactly that with the parent stuff. That was never written into my character description. So I'm learning and absorbing as much as the audience is when all that stuff comes up. So as far as stuff that stuck out to us that we, or maybe that hasn't stuck out to us that needed to have stuck out to us, I hope I didn't miss any of that. But I'm loving it. I think it's, you were already given the best letters is a really fucking ominous and cool hook that I'm, I really want to explore so much more.
4506.26 4513.70 speaker0  I feel like it's adding a really interesting wrinkle to Clark's weird character. Totally.
4512.10 4530.42 speaker2  I'm loving playing it too. Yeah. When we found old Clark's hidey hole and we found that tape of his parents playing on Wheel of Fortune, that was a really cool just moment. Like what the fuck's going on? Yeah.
4528.58 4540.50 speaker3  So let's see.
4536.58 4546.90 speaker1  We've got the picture as well. Oh yeah, fuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4545.94 4555.46 speaker2  I forgot about that. It's just a picture of them with Jim, right? Yep. And they're all like smiley.
4554.02 4560.66 speaker1  Yeah, he was stern. Audio medium. He was stoic.
4560.26 4566.26 speaker3  It's weird.
4565.62 4595.94 speaker1  face to face. I don't know. So curious as to like metagaming, what your thoughts were when you found out that your parents had been to comfy campground.
4592.74 4635.46 speaker2  Now I remember that we saw the names on the tapes. together that they had something to do with the circle of knowledge. participated on the island. So maybe the circle of knowledge needed something from them. Yeah, that's what it is. They needed something from Clark's parents. Holy shit. I didn't put that together until just now. That's super fucking dope. It's, I have a few theories already now what they might've got. Oh, that made me really happy watching your face change.
4634.66 4640.58 speaker1  That's dope. That was cool.
4639.38 4647.38 speaker2  All right, let's move on.
4646.18 4651.54 speaker0  It got poked out. Next.
4650.66 4652.74 speaker2  Very succinct.
4652.42 4661.06 speaker0  Okay.
4658.74 4674.90 speaker2  And I don't remember exactly. I was showing Maggie and she pulled the rod out in front of me and like reassure me that I would be okay. And I think we just went to the next scene. I think I left it there.
4672.82 4685.94 speaker1  So it is at them.
4685.62 4697.14 speaker0  Okay. Nothing for asked how many versions of Clark Bishop have there been so far? Oh, I'm curious. Did you look this up?
4694.90 4761.46 speaker2  But I don't know the, I don't know totally. Okay. So I'll tell you the instances that we've seen other Clarks, uh, one ran into the police department and told Drew not to go to Maggie's house. There was one that was running across a field while I was standing in my kitchen. And it was right when the circle of knowledge first abducted me. Like I saw him running toward me and realized it was, it was a Clark. And then I blacked out and woke up in the circle of knowledge. And then we've just got the old Clark's fuckery. He's in a robe and doing symbols and shit. if it's the same Clark bishops at different points in his life, coming back to touch my Clark's life. I don't know how to differentiate. So I, yeah, so that's the, those are the instances of different Clarks, unless I'm forgetting one. Do you remember if there was another Zach? No idea, man.
4757.70 4776.34 speaker1  Are there any in character secrets that you suspect the other players are keeping from you or any theories about other characters you're not sure of, but you're willing to share?
4771.46 4872.66 speaker2  know if it's that, or if it's just Thomas not remembering, but I feel like he saw files that had a lot to do with all of us. And he told me like he saw an in one of the files and love. I just don't know if he was being cagey with me because he, there was more in the file that he didn't want to share with me or if he was just not remembering it all. I feel like that is an interesting thing that Clark would like to know more about all the files that Thomas saw. And then also everything that happened to John Lee Pettymore is a little bit fuzzy as far as truth or not truth. But I, again, I don't know for sure if it's purposeful or not, but yeah, I think that's fair. And those are the big ones that I'm, I'm curious about anything, theories about other Clark is really fucking conflicted about Maggie. I feel like he, there's a lot of signs pointing to her being shady, but she showed him the fucking scary thing that scared the wits out of him. So he just knows that he needs to make that not a thing. But like we found that note that was maybe her dad saying that Maggie, like he had underlined and over-lined words to like maybe cast aspersions on Maggie. Joe is super conflicted about where to stand with Maggie. Yeah. So he's, he's going to go along with it until something smacks him over the head. I think. Thank you.
4870.66 4888.90 speaker3  I love having you as a player.
4888.02 4900.98 speaker0  He, he needed it.
4900.66 5048.42 speaker1  Let's see. I'm pulling Thomas up right now. Let's see if he's here. There he is. Where the money at? I wish I knew. Not in podcasting. Yeah. If anybody finds out, let me know. Pettymore is currently? Yeah. John, John knows he's not going to tell anyone. I'm cool with that actually. Yeah. the money before you passed out drunk. So I would assume that you hid the money somewhere. That's the answer. John doesn't quite know. literally, you brought this idea to me how long ago, months ago you were like, there should be a Pettymore. That it's like 25 years in the future. However, it was taken from Drew by Rosemary. But then John took it back from her. And so it is in the evidence locker along with the helmet and the radio. Do you have any suspicions that you're being lied to by either of your fellow PCs? The what? The circle of knowledge. Oh, the COK.
5046.58 5070.10 speaker0  If he's pulled any punches then... Yeah, like, oh, I murdered my brother.
5068.50 5087.62 speaker1  That's a really good strategy. It's Keith's strategy. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure. Any other thoughts before your time to go back into the void of the waiting room is your reality? Thanks, dude. I love you.
5087.14 5110.20 speaker0  Love that. Randy's gone.
5109.70 5116.44 speaker1  Oh, shit. Uh, hey...
5114.76 5117.48 speaker3  I accidentally said your real name.
5116.44 5120.04 speaker0  Doesn't have headphones.
5118.68 5126.54 speaker1  He doesn't have his headphones in.
5126.04 5138.44 speaker0  Hey. Hi.
5136.60 5159.16 speaker2  Shit, I don't really know. I think it's something to look into. I was, like, digging through the ground and I saw... What did it say? Like, it was at Beans Pond. Is that right?
5158.04 5192.28 speaker1  Like a vision? When you put on the watch, it felt like your consciousness was changing the channel and you began to phase out of your reality and then you seemed to be somewhere else entirely. You felt wet grass and dirt on your fingers and you were looking at a door in the ground like a sealed metal door that was mostly buried and on the door was an inscription that said
5188.36 5235.96 speaker2  So it's my parents' tomb or something? And then I did see that that was at Beans Pond? Or is that a different part of the vision? Yeah. And that is locked up in a safe in my motel room, right? So it... I mean, definitely we need to go check that out. I even said that we need to go check out Beans Pond at one point. Yeah, you definitely did. So probably go get that watch and maybe see what happens if the other boys put it on. Hmm, interesting. Joe, write that down.
5235.72 5242.04 speaker1  Joe?
5237.64 5249.72 speaker0  Is there any beans left or is Keith the last standing member? Oh, the last standing inheritor. So my bro's dead.
5248.04 5274.68 speaker2  My parents are dead. Is my niece alive still? Well, I don't know. So possibly, I guess, she would inherit my brother's stuff. But I think it's just me, Bean, and my niece.
5272.12 5284.20 speaker1  Any secrets you think they might be hiding from you? Things they're lying about?
5281.96 5317.72 speaker2  since he's the only one that's visited it. I don't know if he knows more about, like, old Clark, but I think there's maybe something that he hasn't necessarily lied about, but just hasn't let up. And then who fucking knows with Pettymore? Nothing off the top of my head that I can think of, like, that I have a suspicion about, but I'm sure there's something.
5317.16 5330.68 speaker0  Welcome. No.
5327.24 5339.16 speaker3  Hey, I got another question.
5333.80 5414.76 speaker1  What's the coolest piece of lore or detail that no one or too few people have picked up on yet? I don't use, like, so much Delta Green lore. I think it's very good and interesting, but I am far more interested in, like, coming up with homebrew shit, and so I don't use a lot of the, like, main lore about the program or the outlaws. I will here and there cherry pick stuff to use, but... What about Zachy Reeves lore that nobody's picked up on? They said, related to the Kudzu no backbone Silver Sphere relationship brought up last week, were the character developments that happened to the boys after their deaths in the Den of Sin supposed to be a weird reversal of the Wizard of Oz? Clark loses his heart, John Lee Pettymore loses his spine, and Keith loses his mind and his empathy. Hmm. that, like, is so subtle and stupid that, like, no one would ever pick up on it. So, bless you, Bazinga Begins, for being the first person I've seen to make that connection. Hell yeah.
5412.52 5424.20 speaker2  I had not made that connection at all.
5419.48 5431.48 speaker3  and it's because, uh... It was because it's...
5430.28 5500.12 speaker1  Oh, wow, sure. And I just, like, saw it and then, like, started thinking about it because I was thinking about the spine, and then I was like, oh, ha, ha, like, when I came up with the heart thing, then I knew that we had to do something with Luke for the mind, and I didn't know how I was going to do it. And then I sent out everybody, like, hey, pick your talents, and Luke literally picked a talent that got rid of his empathy. And so he literally just, like, fulfilled it without me having to do anything. So that was, like, the coolest shit that made me really happy. But Oz, he had a brother, and I was coming up with a brother's name, and his name is Elby because Oz is ounce and Elby is pound. but the Wizard of Oz reversal was one of the bigger ones. Like, at the very end of this whole, like, campaign, I'll do a walkthrough of my dumb shit.
5496.52 5511.64 speaker2  I have the poster hanging on my wall back there. It's...
5510.84 5517.88 speaker0  I've actually got...
5514.20 5561.88 speaker2  but I've got an original Return to Oz poster hanging over there, too. It holds up, dude. It's good. Interesting. I was late on the uptick on that one.
5560.36 5578.44 speaker1  Maladory asks, And then another question which I don't want you to answer. Plot thread you aren't interested in slash care the least about.
5577.56 5583.08 speaker0  Be nice, guys.
5581.16 5613.48 speaker2  I want to see what's up with that. What's up with that? All the helmet and gun and stuff. I really wish that, A, the helmet itself, but B, just all the relationships with those items and all their history and all that is a thread that I would love to know more about.
5611.16 5628.28 speaker0  30-something episodes of how they got. That's what the people have really been demanding. You're passionate.
5626.92 5630.76 speaker2  You're passionate for Rick and Dick.
5629.64 5654.04 speaker1  Honestly, that's a conkin. Call back. That's what a lot of the stans say.
5652.68 5685.80 speaker3  And we got one. Oh wait, sorry. Which plot threads do you guys care the least about? Justin, take it away.
5680.84 5688.44 speaker1  last week's episode and then they posted it on this week's episode and then edited their post
5687.56 5703.24 speaker3  Just got there. Just got to where you answered.
5696.04 5722.22 speaker1  frame and paragraph for every animal that was in there that talked, we did not do one for Bean.
5721.72 5727.88 speaker2  Yeah.
5725.48 5729.64 speaker0  Just like we all aim to do.
5727.88 5742.76 speaker3  All right, well, this has been long. I'm hungry.
5740.52 5764.12 speaker0  I'm glad you guys are interested enough to ask. Not a single wolf, the dog question in there. So fuck you guys. And I'm never coming back.
5761.88 5771.88 speaker1  Younger, hotter. Younger, hotter, yeah.
5770.36 5792.28 speaker2  Well, just post it in the subreddit. Post it in the subreddit or tweet it at us.
5791.32 5796.76 speaker3  I'm tired. I'm so tired.
5794.20 5806.84 speaker1  Yeah, no, thank you all so much for listening. This has been over for some time. No, thank you all so much. Mine will be love. to find.
