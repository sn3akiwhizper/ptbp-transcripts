0.00 41.24 speaker0  Mike Smith here. Thank you again for joining us during our pledge drive this week. You've just heard Under the Mulberry Tree with Mary Ann Kellans and we're about to get into
31.62 96.04 speaker1  taken off. It's of course pretending to be people. An unlikely hit for 694.2 contention and you know for a long time things were kind of done Mike's way but
88.96 121.64 speaker0  remember me from my show with my ex-wife over on KITI in the city. No one circumstances but I've got a lot of great ideas to shake up the way things
115.76 209.48 speaker1  you had a I understand a successful public radio career in the city. I did brought pretending to be people to our to our station and he's brought with it twice a day you've got your morning edition and you're all things considered and then in between you know in a small town you got a lot of time for a know fancy gunplay cop shows going on in this town before you got here but then
204.76 252.08 speaker0  speaking of which we've got a patreon at patreon.com slash pretending pod now I currently a five dollar tier there and we've got some fantastic supporters at give a quick shout out to three of those honorary police officers right now Sasha S Brian C and Jasmine J thank you all so much for listening and
248.20 263.32 speaker1  station and will continue to support it throughout this pledge drive so the
257.20 287.80 speaker0  dollar tier is no longer going to be called honorary police officers at five dollars you'll still get the bonus content on a monthly basis but the name
280.92 304.48 speaker1  police officer will be a splashylvania fastpass holder isn't that fun and I'm
296.80 330.64 speaker0  but we're not stopping there we're also adding both a 50 and even a $100 tier to introduce this first clip from an old classic episode of pretending to be
324.30 366.38 speaker1  of your favorite public radio content and then interrupt them incessantly to the point where they're essentially incoherent you just get a little bit and then ten minutes of two assholes talking maybe just one and now let's cut to a
360.66 407.78 speaker0  Pettymore the fourth Barry Manstein and the fresh Keith Vigna are all standing farmer Jedediah Blechum pokes the pile of cattle skin with his cane say they've coming down about a week or so for about a week this is the only cow
404.22 457.18 speaker1  why don't you wait a couple days before you start asking questions yeah let the been so busy yep and we would have noticed these other cows how many cows
453.70 476.26 speaker0  points his cane up at the sky many lights we come down there in about two
471.98 500.50 speaker1  weakness and just hone right in on it and then pound him that's some rookie just got done with cop school in the city and uh we didn't have any bovine
495.74 511.20 speaker3  first impression as a matter of fact he that's that's brand new for us that's a
506.22 565.90 speaker1  actual crimes in the city you know that's what actual actual crimes in the city not like you don't think animal abuse is a crime up there in the city vigna yeah it's a crime very bad doing me keep my business in charge if farm and I look at you for help and I take a couple steps back this is on you guys
563.34 577.90 speaker3  there's anything you can learn from us I want you to put it down in that notebook
573.74 617.30 speaker1  in this field that baby doesn't jerk is an hour of bluegrass we won't get each week that brings us down to approximately 12 hours of bluegrass a day which I personally think is the
612.82 626.94 speaker0  I'm talking about shout out to everyone down at beans on beans and my new
623.10 676.86 speaker1  it was revitalized as are these contention businesses these are public radio is a responsibility Nile it's not cheap entertainment it's not it's not cops you know it's not America's most wanted it's jazz and
669.90 752.54 speaker0  let's wipe away some of those te ars tears and get hyped up for some new TI er s tears over on patreon.com slash pretending pod just to reiterate if you are currently pledged at $5 a month the only change is your name as a splashylvania fast pass holder you will still have access to the exclusive monthly bonus content in the form of an audio episode what happened to the title of honorary police officer you ask well we thought it was a better fit for the become honorary police officers and will not only have access to the exclusive monthly bonus content but they will also have the opportunity to submit the name and description of an NPC and a location these submissions will be drawn at random and used in the show pretending to be people well now Nile normally we
747.72 769.66 speaker1  be honorary police officers and for that to move to the $10 tier instead of the $5 tier thank you so much for saying that Mike it's maybe the one good idea
762.70 778.74 speaker0  and tell you about the $15 tier at patreon.com slash pretending pod people
769.66 790.86 speaker1  who pledge $15 a month will join the den of sin that sounds inappropriate now
784.98 932.10 speaker0  to a monthly live stream of the pretending to be people crew recording their patreon bonus content and that will include a hangout after for about an hour hour and a half who knows how long it could go and they'll be playing games answering questions it's going to be a bonafide uncanny hootenanny a binging shindig for those of you who want a behind-the-scenes look at the process or who'd want to kick it with the pretending to be people crew this tier is for you again that is the $15 a month tier the den of sin quick shout out to three more of our patrons who've been with us keeping this show going this endless field of corn the four of you contention police officers Clark Bishop John Lee petty more the fourth Barry Manstein and the brand-spankin new Keith vigna you guys come across this semi truck trailer that's just sitting in the middle of this well-planned bald spot on the head that is Jedediah Blaschum's cornfield and he points his cane at it anybody dare to dig came down
929.06 966.02 speaker1  that hard to understand what this guy's saying you just look to worry banks I
961.18 998.26 speaker0  along with Jedediah blush and walk into this semi truck trailer and as soon as all of you are in there the door behind you slam shut and there's a red light that's coming from the opposite side of the trailer also this room that you're in is square it's not the size of this in my truck trailer that you saw hold
993.18 1031.22 speaker1  goddamn job and suddenly everything goes funky well technically a ring tank technically a rectangle is a square I don't know ready to get a magic
1023.66 1206.44 speaker0  that there is what seems to be a gauge that is a red light slowly blinking and each time it blinks it is lowering so it's like a battery power pack or something that is lowering and lit in the room the only thing in this room is a pedestal with a big red button on top and the light above you with each blink gauges and this kid just walked up with a padlock and just hooked it on this lightwise has changed the meter is still lowering but none of you can hear bar lights all the way back up and then continues to beep and is making its way
1202.56 1282.18 speaker3  gauge more closely is it is it demarcated in any way is it is that the right word demarcated does it have markings on it that indicate levels or kept the button pressed that's all I was doing
1278.08 1301.58 speaker1  to press the button but I do want to make a good impression on my new couple inches away from it and I go and just press it a bunch of times each time
1297.78 1406.72 speaker0  it beeps and each time light goes right back to the top Keith we said you could this or if it just started but you feel your socks are wet and looking down you can't quite tell if it's the red from the light or whether the liquid is red that is slowly rising in this room and you're all stepping in a red viscous don't you think now Nile Liotta Oda I'm here with my co-host for the day Mike four point two PT BP you're listening to the pledge drive over on patreon.com
