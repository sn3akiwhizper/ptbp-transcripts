0.00 25.30 speaker0  Welcome, my slimy babies, to the greasiest radio show ever howled out of jowls. It's your big-time, crime-loving, slime-daddy wolf, the dog.
22.00 168.30 speaker1  And cause I think it smells just right, I am slipping and sliding at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the slimiest, grimiest, bad-rimeiest radio station this side of the Great Atlantic Salt Lake. Did y'all know that there's a thing this old wolfie would love for you to do right now? Ah, are you on a computer or an an-deroid? Before you boo-hoo, look around you. Someone is using an iPhone. And maybe I'll read your review, like I'm about to read this one here from D-Town Pods entitled, only about halfway through. D-Town Pods writes, Hard to reach folks that way, though. But I'd appreciate it if more of these reviews talked a little bit more about little old me. Then there's time for news-making. It is the news right now.
166.80 184.30 speaker0  She hollered out,
175.30 224.30 speaker1  Unfortunately for these boys, though, Keith Vigna tripped and slid face-first down into the muddy basin that was once Bean's Pond.
216.30 277.30 speaker0  and Keith Vigna was being dragged by Daddy Kane toward the impassable metal plate, which began to slide open. I swear to me, we better find out what's behind this fucking door before I premiere next week's brand new track, which most assuredly will not be Kudzu With No Backbone.
276.30 303.30 speaker2  It doesn't sucks.
301.30 307.30 speaker3  Host disabled participant screen sharing.
306.30 338.30 speaker2  Oh, right.
335.30 351.30 speaker4  I think, I think it's open now. Okay, good.
349.30 354.30 speaker2  It's so much worse than I-
351.30 376.30 speaker3  Well, no, what he Googled was poopy. No, I Googled pee and poop at the same time. Is what we're getting here.
375.30 382.30 speaker4  Yeah, let's just get back to it. It's so true, why are we doing this? Oh, yeah.
379.30 385.30 speaker2  Loop's internet has been crabbing out for the past, what, hour and 45 minutes while we've been trying to record?
384.30 390.30 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah, like three months.
389.30 477.30 speaker2  Forever. Oh, boy. More fun than this was recording in person and hanging out with friends. What do you do? Do you remember what happened to me last time? Oh, there goes gravity. with the gun that's still pointed in the back of Perry Page's head. There's spaghetti nowhere, as far as you can tell, but the muddy basin that was Bean's Pond does kind of look like a spaghetti bowl that has been finished, but the sauce is still kind of hanging out in the bottom of the bowl as it is filled with a liquid soil. So. Mud. with the gun that John was just holding and the clip is like out the magazine. Well, no. See, you weren't in this reality for two rounds. In the first round, the cat made it up the hill and then the second round rolled an ought one. Smart move, cat. Yeah. That was that ought one was for last time.
475.30 487.30 speaker3  It's true. It's just a ping pong ball with the one written on it.
484.30 500.30 speaker4  This is it.
494.30 517.30 speaker2  plate on the ground in the middle of this muddy basin and that metal plate, aka the door at Bean's Pond that you've been making your way toward, basically, this entire arc,
515.30 528.30 speaker4  move to go do something. Did I end up somewhere different in this world? Oh, yeah, that's fun.
523.30 553.30 speaker2  You're still going to have to act out what you were doing there, but if you fail this dexterity roll, you will fall down into the muddy basin. on the edge of this, what would you call that? Precipice.
552.30 568.30 speaker3  Oh!
565.30 576.30 speaker4  Do I still have my shot lined up on Adam?
574.30 604.30 speaker3  And Adam is the one showing me a Ryan Gosling movie? That is correct.
601.30 605.30 speaker2  I'm not going to throw away my shot.
604.30 617.30 speaker4  I'm taking a shot at Adam.
611.30 651.30 speaker2  You're at a negative 20 for firearms in order to not hit Keith Vigna unless you want to roll at a normal, and then I'll roll a chance that you hit him. Did that make any sense? That didn't make sense to me, so I'll start over.
649.30 688.30 speaker4  He revised that one. I do not pass. It's a 91. Shoot.
680.30 728.30 speaker2  that as soon as this thing happens, I will take my action, and you immediately hear a gunshot ring out. And you see the gun at the back of Kerry Page's head. As the man falls to the ground, Drew Kerry, Kerry Page's inside out, whatever the fuck you want to call Kerry Andrews,
727.30 752.30 speaker4  Bubble gum tree.
751.30 761.30 speaker3  Absolutely.
757.30 768.30 speaker2  it's trying to move your gun through the mud.
765.30 805.30 speaker3  Listen, you're in law enforcement. I was what I once was once might have been considered law enforcement. Now, Adam Kane over there probably told you he could get your body back. The whole world. That's my working theory. So if you give me that ammo back, I can stop them and I can help you get your body, which totally still exists. Roll persuade.
804.30 815.30 speaker4  Fuck!
813.30 818.30 speaker3  Oh, okay. That's right.
817.30 835.30 speaker2  Yeah. This cat continues to back away from you and immediately with one of its paws begins filling the bottom of your pistol with mud. So where the magazine would normally go, it's throwing dirt and mud and rocks in there.
832.30 845.30 speaker3  This guy doesn't know anything about guns. Bullets go there.
843.30 877.30 speaker4  I don't believe so.
874.30 880.30 speaker2  Then twice a Ryan Gosling.
879.30 893.30 speaker3  Yeah, he's got you in a full Nelson.
892.30 1001.30 speaker2  God damn it. Oh, no. Oh, fuck. Into whatever is past this door and Keith, you see a square of light ahead of you as you fall. And when I say the door is closing, it is this metal plate that has slid completely parallel to the ground, horizontal if you will, and it is now sliding back the other way shut. Indiana Jones, this shit.
1000.30 1014.30 speaker3  Straight up. Is it lit other than the light from the hole?
1009.30 1041.30 speaker2  And you're just in there, it's basically concrete, four concrete walls with a concrete floor. And on one of the walls, you see that there is a circle that is made of like the same metal that the door was made out of. Just a circle. Yep, just a circle. Go first, take two damage from the fall. How many hit points did you have?
1037.30 1060.30 speaker3  I have ten and, well, I had ten, now I have eight. Oh shit, dude. Yeah. Can I search him for any weapons?
1053.30 1078.30 speaker2  And when you're kind of like searching all over him, he really, he didn't have a weapon on him. But this helmet, the light is neither red nor green, and you see that the back, there's some glass. And it's shattered. The tubes have shattered as he fell.
1076.30 1107.30 speaker3  I want to approach the circle. There's nothing on it, no writing or anything? No writing, no nothing. I just want to put my hand on it.
1104.30 1134.30 speaker2  And Kerry Pages gets behind him. Please do not move. Clark Bishop, it is your turn.
1133.30 1146.30 speaker4  Yeah, I fail.
1140.30 1169.30 speaker2  You're not going to be able to roll search or alertness to try to see where the shot was coming from. And as you're going down, you trip on a rock and you kind of slip, do one of those banana peel slips, and you fall right on your ass and mud begins piling up as you're sliding down in your crotch area. Do you know how mud might do that?
1166.30 1178.30 speaker4  This is the worst time to look so uncool. I know, you look very silly.
1173.30 1191.30 speaker2  And you got brown crotch, it's just all muddy down there. John Lee Pettymore, what do you do?
1189.30 1224.30 speaker4  And you shit your pants and you pee a little.
1220.30 1236.30 speaker3  but also just mouthing like, oh my God. As he's just running for the door. Okay. Give me a dexterity or athletics.
1235.30 1239.30 speaker2  Nice.
1238.30 1264.30 speaker3  Anything else?
1257.30 1292.30 speaker2  And as soon as you get there, you slide up in this mud to once again an impassable metal plate. A metal door buried in the ground. A critical success would have gotten you there. That or trying to put something in it to Indiana Jones it were your only options. That's the kind of game do you want to play here, Zach?
1291.30 1299.30 speaker3  Indiana Jones it?
1298.30 1302.30 speaker2  Nice.
1300.30 1311.30 speaker4  I did something cool. I helped out a friend.
1310.30 1315.30 speaker2  Okay.
1314.30 1327.30 speaker3  Yeah, you can.
1315.30 1366.30 speaker2  And then pawing at the mud behind you is Agent Trent Catt, which has followed you down into the basin and is now at the radio and is on top of it.
1365.30 1388.30 speaker3  Okay.
1379.30 1426.30 speaker2  And then as soon as it's finished closing, you hear banging from above and you hear John Lee Pettymore the Thirth screaming. Would he be able to hear me if I talked? It's doing that cool like.
1425.30 1428.30 speaker3  Spiral. Spirally like.
1427.30 1431.30 speaker2  Yeah, it's cool. Neat.
1430.30 1572.30 speaker3  I'm gonna yell up. Door's opening up down here. I'm alive. He's knocked out. I'm good. You didn't get sent back in time. No, but there's a door. The pastor's not Silas Cole. He broke my fall with his body and head and the helmet got a little smashed. Nothing's happened yet. I've avoided one head trauma already. I'd like to avoid any in the future, so I'm gonna keep it on. Hopefully I don't need to find out, but the tube's broken, so I don't think it's gonna be working anyway. It's like a circle. I'm about to go in it. I just wanted you guys to let you guys know that I'm safe. As safe as I can be again. Wait, wait, wait for us! I don't know. Let me survey my surroundings and see how many feet I think down I am from you. You're a beans, right? I'm about, I would say, ten feet from that door and I don't know how to open it up. Is the room I'm in small enough to, like, do this up, you know?
1569.30 1576.30 speaker2  I think it's what he's doing with his arms currently.
1572.30 1620.30 speaker3  Like, I wanna, like, press my arms and legs up against the wall and try to climb up it. That'd be really difficult. You can try if you want. Should I, what do you think I should do with Adam? He's passed out. Should I just leave him here? Is there any reaction? I'm not telling you. I'm gonna leave him here unless you think I should kill him.
1619.30 1625.30 speaker4  Is Clark there?
1624.30 1657.30 speaker3  Kill him! Well, what if we need information from him? Uh-uh, no. Who cares?
1651.30 1675.30 speaker2  pants, but you're looking over and you can see that, uh, this cat is on top of the radio and is violently pointing one paw at the broken tube and pointing the other paw at John Lee Pettymore, the Thirth. But John is, you know, on top of this metal plate, either banging on it or yelling through
1674.30 1680.30 speaker4  You, you all right?
1676.30 1704.30 speaker3  He landed on top of Pastor Adam Kane and he's got him knocked out silly and he wants to Is my gun down here with me?
1698.30 1727.30 speaker2  of the forearms, Casey Kristoff, enough blood has splattered up out of this forearm that his eyes just kind of go wobbly and then the rest of his body weebles, wobbles, but it definitely falls down and he just kind of like passes out on his side and Kerry pages looks at you guys and does a shrug. I mean, we weren't paying attention to him anyways. I'm just saying. That's what the listeners see, asshole.
1726.30 1743.30 speaker3  Uh, yeah. to, I don't want him to attack me. John thinks I should kill him. What do you think?
1742.30 1748.30 speaker4  What was his plan? I'm going to like shoot him in the foot so he can't chase me.
1747.30 1786.30 speaker3  How about that? Fuck what he knows. We can ask his fucking wife what he knew. You know what I mean? Kill that fool. I'm going to do this with one ear and then the other one, I'm going to do that.
1780.30 1815.30 speaker2  other ear with a shoulder while holding the gun with the shoulder covered arm. And where are you shooting him?
1812.30 1818.30 speaker3  He'll, or at least not, uh, well. Yeah, exactly.
1817.30 1831.30 speaker4  Shoot him in both feet.
1829.30 1852.30 speaker3  This is what we call an elegant compromise, gentlemen. so they're elevated so they don't bleed as much. What the fuck?
1851.30 1859.30 speaker2  I have to kill him.
1858.30 1867.30 speaker3  I don't know. I don't want one more body on my conscious.
1862.30 1913.30 speaker4  I really, I'm, I'm kind of hoping that Adam is on the right track and we can use it for our purposes and not bad ones.
1904.30 1918.30 speaker2  entrance, there are metal ladder rungs that are going down and there's light coming from down.
1915.30 1936.30 speaker3  I peek my head back through the hole and I say, sleep tight. And then I go down the ladder. Okay.
1931.30 1951.30 speaker2  elevator and it's got a door on the top that swings open that you can jump down into the elevator. hangs from the ceiling.
1950.30 1979.30 speaker3  And you start.
1972.30 2071.30 speaker2  It was just a rock was around you and where there would be one of the metal cage walls, there just was opening to the rock. So you could reach out and touch the rock. Whereas the other three walls were metal cage. There's a what? A blast door. So it's like round on the top and there's a big like circular window all fogged up and old and musty. And then there's a big wheel and then there's a large arm that is latched locking this door I spit on it a little bit. Yeah. Oh, and it gets it going. I like that. it's just been so long. Yeah.
2069.30 2089.30 speaker3  called or Armageddon. I don't remember.
2082.30 2158.30 speaker2  It smells musty earthy with a tinge of mold and the air is thick and humid. up the walls before the rock of the cave structure takes over to form 10 more feet of wall that slowly becomes a cathedral ceiling complete with stalactites dripping fruitlessly on the and tubing on them. The left side is an absolute mess of tables and shelves with papers and folders strewn about haphazardly over this workstation in total disarray. And finally on the far side of the subterranean chamber there is another metal blast door. The lever and wheel to open this thick threshold are on your side and again there is a round window looking into whatever is on the other side.
2157.30 2182.30 speaker3  all about.
2180.30 2312.30 speaker2  skill on your character sheet? Go ahead and roll intelligence for me. It's my lowest. add up. Something about this math is incorrect to you but it seems to be working on the page. He's making or she whatever is making these blueprints based on this science. However there's a whole other set of papers that seem to be devoted. It's like this one notebook. It's trying to come up with some sort of word combination that will grant eternal life is what it says. However there are notes on each page of each time this has been used and the complications and the complications are brutal. The first is like thinning of skin and the second one says removal of nails and the third one is like hair has begun falling out and the final one says humanity seems to be gone. It's working on something called manipulating activator robot A and it is a picture of a all crossed out. All of them. Until the final page the 25th one that says manipulating activator colon robot Y codename
2310.30 2365.30 speaker3  Mary. Mary and Mary Cole. I wonder if it's Mary Cole. Is she a robot? Is there anything else written on the piece of paper? Ooh. You still in a hole?
2364.30 2371.30 speaker5  Goodbye.
2366.30 2393.30 speaker2  You guys hear another door inside of wherever Keith Figna has disappeared to another door inside you kind of hear it go and then there's just silence. Bubblegum tree. Bubblegum tree. Drew we know.
2392.30 2397.30 speaker4  We know Drew. We know it's you.
2396.30 2412.30 speaker3  Am I now?
2411.30 2428.30 speaker4  What? It's in a safe place.
2426.30 2429.30 speaker2  It's so good to see you guys.
2428.30 2480.30 speaker4  Did you get eyes on that shooter? Did you see where that shot came from?
2471.30 2546.30 speaker2  smiling a cold vacant smile behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes and you recognize her immediately as Karen. clearly she's like folding the stock up into the gun to where it literally becomes just like a handheld thing but it's still got this long barrel on it that she then turns and then makes that shorter as well and turns it back into just like a handgun. She holsters it on her side and holds up both of her hands. Clark pulls his gun on her. we're both circle of knowledge members maybe we can let bygones be bygones.
2542.30 2561.30 speaker4  It's my parents and you killed my fucking parents.
2559.30 2565.30 speaker2  given you know orders.
2564.30 2581.30 speaker4  She's pointing at Kevin.
2576.30 2596.30 speaker3  Some aliens took me remind me where we were the last remind me what happened the last
2592.30 2601.30 speaker2  for now although I've heard you've got the hell of a trigger finger anyway don't aim it at me please.
2600.30 2607.30 speaker3  Also fair.
2605.30 2610.30 speaker2  Yeah that's what happened.
2609.30 2622.30 speaker3  Because of the aliens. I've never seen those.
2621.30 2649.30 speaker2  Mine were little. Huh. right? And then you just disappeared you and Kyle I never saw you again. We were gonna sell it but then after you guys got caught I just dipped out I got the fuck out of there.
2648.30 2657.30 speaker3  Yeah. Good thinking good thinking Karen good job good work.
2656.30 2693.30 speaker2  vectors? Because I couldn't find any ever and then I ended up just going a whole other direction. Jim recruited me to this thing that Clark and I are now in Circle of Knowledge. Kevin Clark have you told Kevin about Circle of Knowledge? The stuff we're doing there is great like K cell was one thing but like this shit is legitimately staving off the end of the world swear to god.
2690.30 2702.30 speaker4  Kevin do you want to take this do you know what happened to Kyle? Tell him Karen.
2699.30 2721.30 speaker2  You were running to Apples Beans to go get coffee? Oh shit who's this one? And she points at Drew.
2718.30 2725.30 speaker3  That's the city councilwoman she doesn't know about any of this.
2724.30 2759.30 speaker2  No no no I mean. again I guess this whole town's gonna have to die. the pond but it is you know around you in a big wall. offense don't have this kind of knowledge.
2758.30 2779.30 speaker3  She's a what? A friendly.
2774.30 2802.30 speaker2  and so I figured I'd take out the fucking hillbilly.
2796.30 2844.30 speaker3  have just killed him right away but instead we needed his body to have the alright see first this guy named Doug got he got put in the body of that cat right? Sure I'm I'm following. know we did a little mind switcheroo and we put Doug cat into FBI agents body and now
2842.30 2857.30 speaker2  Clark you were sent to take care of him right? the asylum it's good that he's actually in a cat body that's perfect.
2855.30 2867.30 speaker3  Well what's the asylum?
2862.30 2960.30 speaker2  vectors after that whole debacle in the woods and we were getting close to finishing when we fast and furious that semi to steal Marvin Glass's shipment well right around that time you and Kyle disappeared and Jim told me the asylum was shifting into a more bureaucratic machine focusing more on obtaining technology rather than thwarting world ending vectors so that's when he brought me into the circle of knowledge. Do you know how long he'd been with the circle? Jim? Yeah. Fuck as long as we've known him but yeah no this this little cat here was sent to actually were but then certainly that black bag and the camera and what was it the radio? Well I mean Clark told Leon about all that stuff. same thing in different ways.
2957.30 3001.30 speaker3  he doesn't really know what to do with the information yet. I'm like I really wish that those guys could get down here but also and then I pick up say the words.
2999.30 3008.30 speaker2  Okay the last ones. What do you mean? There were multiple they were tribal in error.
3004.30 3039.30 speaker3  I'll do the one that I'll say the one that you lose your nails. Does anything happen? Al-hai-a-oob-dee. Al-hai-a-oob-dee. Al-hai-a-oob-dee. Al-hai-a-oob-dee.
3032.30 3074.30 speaker2  and every single one of your fingernails and toenails feel like they are being pulled up from the tips but instead of lifting from your nail beds the pain buzzes and the buzzing grows and then your nails begin snapping off like popcorn popping and when the last kernel of a nail has dissected itself from your being you hear a foreboding thud as something slams into the other side of the blast door on the far end of this underground lab. With no mind at all, no mind at all.
