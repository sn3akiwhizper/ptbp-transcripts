0.00 25.90 speaker0  Hello, one. Hello, all. Hello, y'all. It's your best friend with a trash-eating problem, Wolf the Dog. We are hitting you live from 694.2 PTBP.
20.60 141.90 speaker1  Mmm, sounds like it's about garbage bin o'clock for y'all, Wolfy boy. Speaking of trash, earlier I took my dog, Wolf the Dog, to go find him something to fill his little belly up with. But upon venturing outside the sky, I suddenly darkened all around us for a little bit. Y'all ever seen an eclipse? It was like that, but a little different. It was real spooky, y'all. Wolf nearly shit his little old britches. It is emblazoned with a solid green triangle and says, For a wolf at the top, I guess it's this week's Howlin' with Wolf. It comes from user Chucklin' Boy over on the subreddit. He's an Android user, but logged into iTunes on his computer to leave a review. This boy sure knows how to make ol' Wolfy blush. Chucklin' Boy writes, Something fitting, isn't that? And remember, the mission is over when the world ends. We are starting to see more discussion around the Greater Delta Green Cannon, as well as game running tips and general show stuff. See y'all there! Wolf bless you, Chucklin' Boy. tag us on Instagram or Twitter, at PretendingPod,
138.00 236.00 speaker0  Fuck Mark Zuckerberg, it's time for the news. Keith shot it until it dissipated. The words on the paper turned to little sparks that danced around, bathing the boys in a warm light. Clark charged at himself, only to grab two fistfuls of cloak and bonk his head
231.00 239.50 speaker3  Iowa, Tennessee, Kentucky, Kentucky.
236.00 242.00 speaker2  One more Nebraska corner hit us up toward the top.
239.50 255.00 speaker3  Nebraska. Nice. Nice. Got it.
253.50 260.50 speaker2  It's two bears. Describe, yeah, I'm just kidding. Two bears.
258.50 310.50 speaker3  Two bears. Okay. It's just two bears. Well, cause yours has too much, but mine kind of dissipates real quick. Get out. I'm not gonna do it. Get out. I can't do it. I refuse to do it. I would hire Phillip Morris to pursue you. Okay, I'm good.
308.50 348.50 speaker2  He is insane. He's come back around. This last one?
346.50 355.50 speaker3  I was like, god damn it.
353.50 373.50 speaker2  Good to listen back to. Good to be embarrassed by yourself. It's important. Cons, the keeper's voices. Wait, what was that poster?
372.50 391.50 speaker3  I like that a lot. Welcome to the chuckle hut. We'll find out.
389.50 482.50 speaker2  You just feel this immense pain. It's almost like a shock has just covered your entire body. Your stomach hurts. You just feel it all up in your throat. Your ears are ringing and pulsating. It's dark. It's cold here. It smells. What is that smell? It's like savory? There's a sweetness to it and your eyes begin to adjust. There's a pool of blood on the floor. The corpse of Ari Manstein is kind of in it. Her coffin is flipped over on the cold dirt. You look at each other. Blood splatter has speckled each of you. John, Kevin, Lee Pettymore all in black tactical gear. Keith Vigna in his brightly colored polo and boat shoes. Clark Bishop in an old contention PD uniform currently holding a thick black cloak. The shock begins to wear off. You feel a searing pain on your chest, on your back, on the bottom of your left foot and inside your dominant palm. Yes, all four. It is the chest, the back, the left foot and inside your dominant palm. I would assume you're all right handed unless you've specified otherwise. John Lee Pettymore kind of seems like he would be left handed. Did it change when you went into Kevin?
480.50 519.50 speaker3  You're ambidextrous I think. So Kevin was left handed so now you've got a really weak right hand. Damn dude, I know how to solve that.
512.50 522.50 speaker2  My mom is left handed like a liar and she always put the pencil in my left hand when I was growing up.
521.50 543.50 speaker3  Be like me son. My dad's left handed and he went to Catholic school and part of their thing was trying to make kids right handed who were left handed. He also broke his arm when he was a really young kid and he still remained left handed. He said that is how strongly it took to him.
542.50 548.50 speaker2  Okay sorry.
547.50 549.50 speaker3  Yes inside the palm.
548.50 578.50 speaker2  Can I look at my palm? It says T-I-L-D-E. Tilde. Okay. Do you boys have Tilde written in your hands? I do.
573.50 589.50 speaker3  I think I would want to check what our backs say but I mean I'm looking at my hand and then I'm looking in front of me and do I still see old Clark? He's holding the robe.
588.50 603.50 speaker2  His depends. Yeah.
601.50 609.50 speaker3  Smells like real estate agent. Okay so yeah.
608.50 612.50 speaker2  Yeah. Boys my back is burning.
611.50 634.50 speaker3  Is there something written? Mine too. I'll check your back while I take my shoe off and you check my foot. And we play Twister.
630.50 678.50 speaker2  across the burned skin on your chest and on your back. And you all see that on each of your chests burned in are the letters M-A-R-V-I-N. On your back it says D-R-E-W. And on the bottom of each of your left feet it says M-A-G-G-I-E. Clark the bottom of your left foot when you look at it, it also has this very distinct lack of skin, a discoloration. Okay.
677.50 684.50 speaker3  Yeah.
683.50 710.50 speaker2  Okay. Surrounding it. That's only on Clark's foot? Gotcha. They do not. Okay. These look much cleaner. Okay. I need everyone to roll a sanity check for me.
709.50 712.50 speaker3  Wonderful.
711.50 719.50 speaker2  84. All three of you lose one sanity. Let's see where that puts you each. That puts me at 19.
718.50 733.66 speaker3  I'm at 11.
728.50 835.14 speaker2  is going into effect now for John Lee Pettymore that he broke into on the last episode or two episodes ago. And then fittingly John Lee Pettymore as well as Clark Bishop both rolled over their power so we'll see what that does moving forward. What we're going to do for this third and final breaking point for each of you, you're going to roll a D100 on the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition manias table. We're going to roll it three times and then choose. All right. 61, Kleptomania, the irrational compulsion for stealing. 62, oh boy, Ligeromania, L-I-G-Y-R-O, mania, uncontrollable compulsion to make loud or shrill noises. I really don't. Please don't do that one. I really suggest. 51. 51 is Gymnomania, G-Y-M-N-O mania, which is a compulsion with nudity. A compulsion with nudity? Like it has to be nude? It says with nudity. With nudity. Yeah.
833.10 839.82 speaker3  I'm going to just take the stealing one.
838.82 903.02 speaker2  That absolutely makes sense. Sure. A 30 is Colromania, C-O-U-L-R-O mania, it's an obsession with clowns. Okay. A 92, you said? No, what was it? 94? Uh-huh. Interesting. 94? The 94 was the belief in god. Belief in god. Oh, 30. Nope.
902.02 913.02 speaker3  We did that one already. Okay, the 92. I think so.
911.02 994.02 speaker2  That's the dopest one. That seems obvious. Belief that he is a god. That's what I thought. Yep, pretty straightforward. and persuasions. Ari Manstein, there is the coffin flipped over, and then you know that outside of this tomb are still the three android men, their corpses are out there. What would you like to do? If the two of you could roll unarmed combat against each other to see who gets the upper hand. Yeah. Alrighty, Thomas rolled a d10 for damage. Six.
992.02 1013.02 speaker4  I'm screaming as I'm running toward him. I mean, I'm just guttural yelling as I charge you.
1012.02 1035.02 speaker3  I saw old me. Who are you? Why couldn't you warn me about that? Who are you? the muzzle of the gun.
1033.02 1045.02 speaker2  Your ears are ringing.
1038.02 1048.02 speaker3  I rush over to Clark and try to apply first aid to his.
1045.02 1057.02 speaker2  Roll first aid for me.
1056.02 1078.02 speaker3  A one. Cool. That's what's important here. I'm like, why are you fighting? What is happening?
1076.02 1093.02 speaker4  I don't, I'm sorry. I just, it just freaked me out. I just, I'm sorry.
1090.02 1106.02 speaker3  Like John is just looking down at his body in confusion. I mean, we're all burnt up. We got Tildy, Maggie, Marvin. Tildy.
1105.02 1108.02 speaker4  Oh fuck.
1107.02 1129.02 speaker3  I remember now. It seems like I failed a sanity check or something, but I'm sorry. I'm awful sorry for shooting you in the leg. We ought to solve this Tildy thing. I shouldn't, I shouldn't have startled you.
1124.02 1137.02 speaker4  That, that made sense.
1134.02 1169.02 speaker3  Remember you think you're a God now. get some fresh air. I go over to Ari's body and kind of look at both my fellow officers and start trying to get her back into the coffin. That way we can just leave here without feeling guilty and go fucking figure some shit out.
1167.02 1184.02 speaker2  So like an open wound. So extremely painful when you go to grab her.
1181.02 1193.02 speaker3  And I think where it's laying right here, it's good enough. Nobody else needs to come into this mausoleum anyway.
1190.02 1198.02 speaker4  around my waist as a giant makeshift bandage. Absolutely.
1194.02 1213.02 speaker3  Was there a book that old Clark was reading out of?
1207.02 1222.02 speaker2  You saw the page kind of burn up and then turn into these lights that danced around you.
1218.02 1240.02 speaker3  I think maybe the words are on us now. What does Tildy, Marvin, Drew and Maggie, what do they have in common? Other than we all know them.
1237.02 1244.02 speaker4  Do you think their locations on our bodies mean anything?
1243.02 1266.02 speaker3  We can try to figure that out.
1264.02 1276.02 speaker4  That's true, yeah.
1268.02 1286.02 speaker3  I don't know what the others would mean, but we have gotten so distracted in the past 40 minutes. Do you guys still want to go with this plan for Marvin Glass?
1283.02 1291.02 speaker4  I've got this handy wound here that makes it look like you guys shot me. That's true.
1290.02 1354.02 speaker3  You're an even better Chewbacca. I mean, it doesn't make it look like we shot you. I don't have a better theory, but I think we ought to stick to the plan. Well, I don't know where Tilde is, so... Unless you have better suggestions, I say we get back to the police car as we were going to before we ran into the cops, ran into this crazy fucking long-arm beast. Let's get in the car. Beast, you beast! Give these FBI or not people a call and drive over to Marvin's and try to get some shit figured out before we fucking kill each other.
1351.02 1362.02 speaker4  Say it all goes off without a hitch and we're in, then what?
1359.02 1364.02 speaker3  And I just turn heel and I walk out of the mausoleum.
1362.02 1380.02 speaker4  I start limping out behind him.
1371.02 1406.02 speaker2  and you limp past these three dead android dudes and you keep moving through these crypts, these above-ground tombs, these mausoleums of the city cemetery, and you make your way to the parking lot where there are only two cars present. Keith Vigna's contention police department cruiser and Clark Bishop's silver Honda Accord provided by the Circle of Knowledge.
1401.02 1411.02 speaker4  Let me check. Anything in that car? I'll open up the glove box.
1406.02 1420.02 speaker2  Yeah, as long as you brought your guns and your couple phones with you, then you're good to go.
1418.02 1438.02 speaker3  They might ask us why we all have... That's why we go to the free clinic, not the emergency room. And then he looks at me and he's like, what the fuck does that mean?
1434.02 1440.02 speaker4  I'm hurt pretty bad, fellas. It wouldn't bother me at all.
1438.02 1515.02 speaker3  Okay, let's do that then. Want to take another pass at that? Very cool name.
1513.02 1529.02 speaker4  And he writes down... Clark Chisup.
1527.02 1538.02 speaker2  Lil Chaz Fauntleroy. Oh! Hell yeah.
1537.02 1541.02 speaker4  I happen to have some of that.
1540.02 1555.02 speaker3  I got 30.
1550.02 1558.02 speaker2  For each success, I'll give a plus 10% bump to whoever's got the highest. I have 50.
1557.02 1561.02 speaker3  30. I rolled a 16. Hell yeah.
1560.02 1578.02 speaker4  So we don't need it, right?
1576.02 1585.02 speaker2  Thank you so much for coming in.
1584.02 1589.02 speaker4  Oh, there it goes back to you.
1588.02 1595.02 speaker3  Woo! Three, but I only need one to get back up to max. Give one to Joe. Two.
1593.02 1603.02 speaker4  That puts me at a 16. I'm at 19.
1600.02 1616.02 speaker2  It's 2 p.m. The sun is high in the sky on December 6th. It's still a pretty cold day here in the city. Which cars did you bring both of them? I think we all hopped into the PD car. Oh, that's right. I was there. Okay.
1615.02 1684.02 speaker3  We're gonna go. I have nothing else to say to a robot. I would like to talk to the officers that I talked to a couple of days ago.
1682.02 1711.02 speaker2  And the line goes dead. You can see an after picture after he peed his pants. Only on Instagram. Only on Instagram.
1710.02 1721.02 speaker3  And they got more yellow.
1719.02 1750.02 speaker2  I know that you like role playing wise, like. Sure, yeah. You can just evolve into your character from here as you move forward. At 6, so you'll gain another disorder at 6 sanity points.
1749.02 1753.02 speaker3  I'm at 18 right now. Gotcha. And what's your power?
1752.02 1758.02 speaker2  Power is 12. Right, so then you'll also have another breaking point at 6. Right, yeah.
1757.02 1762.02 speaker3  Well now mine's at. Oh, from earlier. From earlier, yeah.
1761.02 1772.02 speaker2  I think it's 7. Okay, cool. So your next breaking point will be at 7, and then Luke just has one breaking point left.
1770.02 1773.02 speaker3  I'll be a bing bong boy.
1772.02 1779.02 speaker2  You'll go insane forever.
1778.02 1785.02 speaker4  Can you do that in this game?
1783.02 1858.02 speaker2  Oh, it's going to the therapist, right? It is, yeah. So there's a couple ways that you can do it. Oh, yeah. but I have given you guys no downtime in this campaign whatsoever. And downtime is normally when you would bump stats, train new stats. You might reconnect with your family, go to the therapist, any of those things. We haven't done any of that. We'll maybe try it on the next campaign to add that back in, but for this one we're not going to worry about it. And then as far as gaining sanity besides going to the therapist, in a lot of Delta Green scenarios, at the end there will be bonuses for sanity. If you take out a threat or whatever, then you can gain sanity back. I'm all for that, but you guys have only done things that would lose sanity. Right. All right, cool.
1857.02 1863.02 speaker3  Didn't get to talk to anybody. Yep.
1862.02 1875.02 speaker4  Right.
1871.02 1909.02 speaker3  So John, I think you're going to be driving us to Jim's house. All right. which have fun Missouri facts on the back of them, and they list one of our five primary crops as forage, and none of us knew what that was, so I looked it up, and forage are crops grown specifically to be grazed by livestock or consumed as hay. That was my guess. Makes sense. It doesn't have to go on air, but I just looked it up and I wanted to tell you guys now. To keep that methane pumping, baby.
1905.02 1928.02 speaker2  We're an edutainment podcast now, technically speaking.
1927.02 1948.02 speaker3  What? That's a pretty cool number.
1946.02 1966.02 speaker2  Yes, that we recorded earlier. It's between our listeners.
1964.02 1997.02 speaker3  Don't Google it.
1990.02 2029.02 speaker2  And as you guys are pulling in, you see that there are flyers put up on every poll. And on each of these flyers is Clark Bishop's face. Underneath it says, Clark Bishop, call cops if seen. Say, quote, violent EDP. Oh, I don't have internet right now. Why is the wifi down? Oh, look it up.
2027.02 2099.02 speaker3  Emotionally disturbed person. And you can go up there and just collect fossils. Dinosaur bones. Thanks for that fun Missouri fact. EDP is emotionally disturbed person. That is right. And you're a violent one apparently.
2090.02 2134.02 speaker4  He asked what I was doing here and I just told him I didn't know and I must have come off hanky to him or something. I don't know. But he left in a hurry after I talked to him. Next time you should kill him.
2131.02 2143.02 speaker2  So, Clark, you would roll human.
2141.02 2227.02 speaker3  So, whatever is higher, I think. Let's just get in here, get this book and- Did you know Jim very well, Jon? It's just a song, boys. Let's go. Okay. I look at both of them, kind of roll my eyes, and then walk into Jim's house.
2225.02 2249.02 speaker2  There's an upright piano in the entry. The living room has papers and binders strewn all over the coffee table, couch, chairs, the floor, really just everywhere all over this house. The sun is shining in through the window, illuminating a fair amount of dust that is moving slowly upward.
2245.02 2264.02 speaker4  Clark starts walking toward where he last saw the book.
2258.02 2295.02 speaker2  and sitting out on the kitchen counter are the other items that you saw when you came through here last time. And then sitting out in the living room with all the papers and binders and stuff all over the place, you see this big book. It's leather and thick, and it has a symbol on the front that you obviously have come to recognize. It's the big circle. It's the Circle of Knowledge logo surrounded by six smaller circles. And the thick leather book has a girthy wooden bookmark, and it is stuck toward the back of the book.
2290.02 2308.02 speaker4  I pick up the book, and I just kind of lift it. This is the one I was talking about. It is. Let's us try to open it.
2304.02 2320.02 speaker3  Well, can you try to take the bookmark out and put it in a different page?
2317.02 2342.02 speaker2  What happens when Keith and John try? The three of you are all now hands and feet all in trying to pry this book open. Keith is on the floor with his feet in the air, you know, kind of tugging on it. Trying to get the boat shoe grip on there.
2341.02 2370.02 speaker3  Jim. It seems, I don't really know, I mean, why are we even coming to get this in the first place? Maybe as an offering or something?
2366.02 2399.02 speaker2  And over and over and over on this ancient parchment is the phrase, It is only through death that he may rise again. It, death, and he are all capitalized. And drawn over this obsessive scrawl is a picture of a hooded figure that you just saw with a brilliant light shining from its maw.
2395.02 2418.02 speaker4  She called it her dad's book even, like it was maybe his personal copy or something. Well, hell, Clark, it almost sounds like they're talking about you.
2417.02 2480.02 speaker3  Only through, oh. You could be some kind of messiah, some kind of a child of prophecy. And I kind of, I look, the way that Clark said it and what I saw in his eye, I kind of start to believe it too. What are you touching yourself for?
2473.02 2502.02 speaker4  Fellas, this is a, when I was trying to pry the book open to another page, this kind of flitted out of the book, and I hand it to him.
2494.02 2515.02 speaker2  The letter then goes on to outline new guidelines, including the immediate reassignment of all members of the disposal unit. And at the top of the page, it says, faith through knowledge is just called knowledge.
2514.02 2543.02 speaker4  Oh, okay. Excellent.
2542.02 2574.02 speaker3  Now it's Drew. I don't know, I think Drew might be.
2563.02 2660.02 speaker2  And as it runs down to the tip of your nose, you inhale, you kind of, oh, and you snort in and it is, um, it's, it's vodka. Oh yeah, there's a stain on the ceiling. It's pooling. There's a Ziploc bag containing two small items, a single tarot card, the devil with several bullet holes in it, as well as a taxidermied baby squirrel. There's also a leather holster for a firearm. There isn't a gun in it, but there is a small bit of text tooled into the leather. It says scientia morse est underneath it. It says dash K uppercase K. And then there's also a ring. It's got some small little curly hairs on it.
2659.02 2662.02 speaker4  Yeah. I went upstairs to get pants. I'm pretty sure.
2661.02 2693.02 speaker2  Oh yeah. It's a two story house. Is this a two story house?
2690.02 2703.02 speaker4  I don't really know. I kind of wondered if that squirrel was the work of Julie Maxwell. She was into taxidermy, but there's no way for me to know.
2696.02 2728.02 speaker3  As soon as I heard, as soon as I saw that it was a taxidermy squirrel, I thought of Julie Maxwell and of that hat that I put on. Well, hat. Is it big enough to fit on any of my fingers?
2722.02 2739.02 speaker2  And the logo is an M created out of four double helices. Wish I would have put that on.
2738.02 2769.02 speaker3  I look around. Pretty sure that probably has something to do with Marvin Glass, I would assume.
2768.02 2773.02 speaker4  Is it M?
2770.02 2775.02 speaker3  Oh, no, no. I don't know. I'm just, I got Marvin on my mind.
2774.02 2778.02 speaker4  Just the shape of DNA. I don't know. Marvin!
2777.02 2780.02 speaker3  I had a...
2779.02 2785.02 speaker2  Marvin!
2784.02 2802.02 speaker3  God. I take the other shoelace off, slip it into the ring, and I'm wearing it around my neck now. Dope. Love it.
2801.02 2817.02 speaker4  Keith, I found that in a pile of pubes. No, it was pubes. You might just want to wash it.
2815.02 2825.02 speaker3  Well, I just kind of... I kind of shake... While it's around my neck, I shake it off and hope most of the pubes come off.
2823.02 2838.02 speaker2  But at this point, there's some nice sunlight coming in through the kitchen window, and you can see the pubes kind of swirl around in a nice...
2832.02 2841.02 speaker3  At the end of the day here, one of the least concerns I have is touching pubes at this point.
2839.02 2852.02 speaker2  When was that ever a concern for you?
2849.02 2856.02 speaker4  but that would have to be a lot of vodka upstairs to make it drip through the ceiling, right? Let's go check that out.
2855.02 2858.02 speaker3  I'll head on up there.
2857.02 2883.02 speaker2  I follow behind him. As you're walking through, there's a couple hallways, some rooms, couple rooms, a bathroom, a closet. But you start to realize as you're walking in these doors that the vodka is spilling from a place where there isn't a room that could actually put you in that spot in the living room.
2879.02 2888.02 speaker4  Can I just put my ear to a wall that I think would lead to where that vodka would be coming from?
2884.02 2900.02 speaker2  Yeah, as you put your ear to the wall where you think the vodka would be dripping from, you actually do hear a slight static noise. But if there was a room there, it seems like it's been maybe walled off or something.
2899.02 2910.02 speaker3  Let's search for a door. Well, we either search for a door or it's not there anymore. We need to bust in through it.
2908.02 2912.02 speaker4  Would tapping on the wall reveal a door if there was one?
2911.02 2920.02 speaker3  Or, you know, just a simple search rule.
2915.02 2925.02 speaker2  With the three of you working together, let's have the two assist the one with the best search, as we did earlier with the health that was unnecessary.
2924.02 2927.02 speaker3  I've got a 40. I've got a 50.
2926.02 2933.02 speaker4  I've just got the basic 20.

2936.02 2940.02 speaker4  I rolled a 13.
2938.02 2956.02 speaker3  I mean, we could have both helped him, but it's still the 78. I want to use my athletics to just falcon kick this wall where there's not a stud. Roll athletics. 43 on a 50. There's no time to go.
