850.16 864.00 speaker1  would you let me take that one yeah i don't know if it would ever come up if i mean we'll we'll see it would be fun when it came up if it came up to be afraid of fog yeah let's make it happen i like
860.00 1030.72 speaker3  that yeah yeah let's go with fear of fog that's fun all right we'll get the other boys in here other you're having all these memories flashback and you remember everything that already happened the flesh of your chest has a strike through it it is completely crossed out looking around at the other burn marks that you remember from last time tilde is still written inside your dominant palm it's not crossed out each of you kind of check each other drew is burned into the flesh on your backs it's not crossed out i was planning on getting one of those anyway so of your left foot says maggie and clark as you saw last time and the other two saw as well the flesh on the bottom of your left foot has been eaten away in the symbol of the circle of knowledge
1025.60 1039.28 speaker2  bottom of it we'd have to go figure out if he's dead right now or not what if we i think we should just go take care of this other shit cross brands off our body we lost other people in there is
1035.76 1068.40 speaker1  there somebody is there some way we could we don't have to figure out marvin's there now just
1061.84 1144.72 speaker3  of three men that you fought they're the men with the scars on their faces and necks wearing all black and their bodies are still strewn across the makeshift stage of ari manstein's funeral whoever has the highest intelligence i think it's me 75. saw rosemary was when you were standing on top of water right and she reached for the gun
1139.68 1196.72 speaker1  so if she answers the phone we'll know that whatever we did didn't didn't happen i don't we gotta send them on a vacation away from here i'm tired of this damn game we're playing
1191.76 1219.04 speaker2  drew why don't all right i'm gonna call rosemary and we'll see if we've taken her out of all existences in worlds or just the one we can also if she's still alive we'll just call her back in
1214.32 1430.64 speaker1  it even matters if the name is crossed off on our chest and like we just don't we just don't mess yeah so we went we went over there to see i haven't been clark in a while and i mean if his name is crossed off on her chest maybe we stopped him maybe we stopped his that conversation i don't remember i remember that i remember the big one i asked him that's
1423.20 1590.08 speaker3  dark images begin flashing through your mind just snippets moments and you try to keep up as the speed of the sequence waxes and wanes you see a motel safe shiny black and closed you see the sign for beans pond the little pond behind chief maggie cook's house in contention you see a television it is blinking with different letters on it r s t l n e you see a small clearing in the woods massive shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with silvery arms extending from either side a tube connects this gargantuan ball to a machine below the machine begins whirring and you see a small metal sphere roughly one inch in diameter begin moving up through the tubing into the larger amount of light and sound pours into the room revealing text painted on the back wall that says the same thing you hear violently chanted by an unseen crowd planet juggernaut recently stood in as kevin alongside rosemary marvin is holding the odd camera with glass tubes closely inspecting it tapping its lit red luminaire on his desk are two file folders two file folders splayed open entitled the real files on clark bishop and keith vigna contention police officers you can see in keith's file are various clippings about the beans family the tragic the tragic accidental deaths of william and lena keith's parents the takeover of the behind asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes written in sharpie underneath the mugshot
1586.00 1643.20 speaker2  planet juggernaut is still kind of ringing in his ears and they just see like a single marvin has the gun and the camera if we think our actions might be permanent and then head on back to contention i'd get a burger or something in the meantime you're quite full john lee pedemore was always down for a burger what if we somehow interfered with what
1636.08 1687.68 speaker1  we i look around i mean wouldn't we be here now if we if the motion was still going forward in time on us they set us into a tizzy and we went over and did stuff against marvin and then we woke up back here where old me has put brands on us and marvin is crossed out so maybe he's trying to tell us not to worry about marvin anymore and go after something else on our body list yeah i mean it
1681.68 1820.00 speaker2  seems that way well one thing i was thinking in your vision you had beans pond was in it right yeah i remember when i got that watch from my brother when i put it on i had a vision of of digging through dirt and mud and and finding like a door or something in the ground and for some reason i just think i just feel like i i ought to go get that watch and we maybe we should go to putting it back on with you guys around because it was making me go crazy you were seeing you universe or timeline or something i had to take it off because it was i felt like i could have bad happened and i think maybe if i put it on around beans pond i might be able to remember i feel like also uh we'll find out what name is connected to when we get to the pond yeah plus it's in contention so it could be maggie or drew we see tilde waiting for us beneath the door like he's our friend i feel like if he was in trouble we might as well go back and try to find him and
1815.28 1851.04 speaker1  investigate this this watch i didn't do this last time but i could check in with maggie my my job here was to kill stan manstein and i did that and last time she said i'd have some downtime between here and there if i wanted to help you guys whatever but get a hold of her this
1845.84 1922.24 speaker2  don't know i guess i could just not say just check in and tell her that stan's dead and see what she
1916.32 1970.64 speaker3  light shining in but this tomb is you know small crowded you three are in there there's a coffin
1962.64 2042.32 speaker1  you shot me last time i'm glad we've reached a new level in our relationship that's shooting from the unarmed combat so i fail my hell yeah okay the three of you all trip onto the ground
2036.08 2159.84 speaker3  and the sun is beating down on this frigid december day aside from the three android men bodies you notice the crawfish boil still going strong and then there's that old lady in a wheelchair who's like trying to get out of here as fast as she can it's taking a while but only
2155.12 2292.00 speaker2  out and then she saw us come out a second time without going back in that means that means we are already on our way good so maybe we should just fucking hang around until after we see just spoiler this for us you said the butterfly effect that means we weren't there the first time it's after all the commotion is done and we just walk in there we need to get away from this mausoleum in case some more of ourselves come out of there let's just go all we have to do
2285.44 2316.96 speaker3  fun guys honestly 53 episodes pretty solid we wrapped up every loose end yeah
2313.36 2383.60 speaker1  do you want to literally wait or do you think we should work on something else and then we're like oh yeah we're probably finishing up at marvin's about now then go get those well look we never like think real hard about coming back to the mausoleum as old clark's to maybe and then i
2378.08 2536.48 speaker3  so joe but because you crit failed that check on a natural you're gonna get hit with a big wave basically how this works is when you freaked out this knowledge wasn't in your head at all you literally just broke a part of your brain just snapped apart right but then when they bring it up you start to piece together what you had seen and what you saw was a dark room surrounded by wood and stone and beautiful ornate candlesticks curtains it's really lush and beautiful in this room it's very clearly not this time period by candlelight you see huddled over a desk is a figure wearing a black cloak scribbling furiously into a book the book itself is extremely ornate seems to be made of some sort of leather that you don't recognize almost uncured and bleeding and as the camera pans around you see lit by this candle is the face of a very old very decrepit clark bishop behind the steering wheel is maggie cook it's a silver accord and she grabs her phone and starts more full last time but your mind couldn't even comprehend them enough these are the traces of information that you could pull out that you're remembering now and as you're remembering it and
2532.24 2547.68 speaker1  went to whatever town he was from and got me a pin that i still have that says uh i lost my heart to alfred packer
2542.24 2588.40 speaker2  the the university where they went was in that town and they're like sardonically in the 60s
2583.92 2707.36 speaker3  get to the parking lot get to the parking lot right now uh uh uh uh hey i'm putting you on the city cemetery and head back into the parking lot and there you see that the only car in the
2700.72 2786.24 speaker2  lot is clark bishop's silver honda accord on loan from the circle of knowledge i trailed behind a little bit because i uh when they were out at earshot i told the old lady that she might as well just stay here because how slow she's going she's gonna be back pretty soon and then i laugh two deaths i've been on my game for 95 years you're not gonna fucking push me through the
2778.56 2946.72 speaker3  you guys are standing around and a silver honda accord comes flying down it matches the one that's sitting in front of you and driving is maggie cook john lee pettymore and keith vigna have not seen she pulls up right next to you guys rolls down her window and she's got big ass sunglasses on and i you you three might be the only one who can handle this right now because if he sees me he will lose his marbles but you know bruce robin and then she looks at keith vigna specifically and keith you would know that bruce robin is ferguson's business partner okay and he is now the full owner you would know bar corp is beans and robin corporation they just go by bar corp he has gone just fully insane he is a danger to everyone around him he is a danger to the mission of the circle of knowledge and he is a danger to the world as we know it i hate to do this to you
2939.28 2956.08 speaker2  uh hijacked in a way i think by marvin glass uh and he was forced to kill is he just talking in
2951.12 3002.80 speaker1  us is he gonna be all right on this mission maggie this is this is the john that i worked with yeah
2997.12 3023.28 speaker3  out of the seat next to her and she just like holds it directly up into the ceiling her hand

3038.40 3096.00 speaker3  take your finger off the trigger and her finger goes off to the side put your gun away and she sets it down in the shotgun seat next to her and she looks up at you and she's like john yes max i need your help anything in your car is sitting in your shotgun seat in your silver honda accord and it's lit up
3090.80 3121.20 speaker2  in on what's going on like calm her down but also just kind of like calmly explain to her how i got to be like this okay just like confront it straight up be like man this is scary shit but here's what

3128.08 3185.76 speaker2  it and i put my hand on my gun i say it wouldn't be the first robin i kill and then i twirl my gun out it accidentally shoots a shot up in the air and i go two birds and a bald eagle falls dead
3181.36 3200.32 speaker1  she this she i said because i thought it was a woman who dropped yeah it looked like a woman
3194.72 3214.64 speaker3  there was a text on the phone when you got it that said do you want to know how your parents died and then you texted back who is this yeah nice and currently you have a text on this phone that says your parents owned an artifact of immense power too much power for them to be trusted with bye
