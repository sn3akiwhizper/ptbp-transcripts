0.00 62.80 speaker0  Welcome to the cream zone, my pastries. It's your putrid patissier, Papa Wolf the dog, and I am here to cover all the butter-filled dough in various sweet sauces of my choosing. I hope y'all like some sweet grease. I am rolling out that dough live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio station that doubles as a bakery in the dream times. Now I know y'all know that I love kneading that dough, but what I really need is some external validation from the listeners of my show. I have a need to knead, but my need to be kneaded is so much greater. This howling with Wolf was sent in by Modern Cannabis from Grand Junction, Colorado, who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod an equally meaningful and easy thing to do. He writes,
60.72 70.92 speaker1  the deepest depths of my soul. Keep spinning those great tunes
68.00 125.68 speaker0  I hope those contention boys you keep telling us about manage to vacuum up all that nasty ooze I keep seeing out and about. And lastly, a shout out to the best playing group a fledgling keeper could ask for. Kyle, Lexi, and Moriah couldn't ask for a better group of funny, smart, and kind people to play with. Lots of love, Modern Cannabis. I wish, I wish I had a couple of buddies that were funny, smart, and kind. All I got is my producer and my dog, Wolf the dog, the dog. My producer is a piece of shit and Wolf the dog, the dog merely tolerates my existence.
122.88 143.86 speaker1  Wolf the howl, write up a five star review on Apple podcasts and send a screenshot on Instagram or Twitter.
141.00 161.46 speaker0  And while you're using your fingers to peruse the unfathomable thing that is the internet, Some kid named Luke shit posts there constantly with the finesse of an Olympic athlete.
158.04 172.38 speaker1  The community is just as sweet as they are filthy.
169.30 218.54 speaker0  for 23 exclusive episodes. in the den of sin this Friday night, August 20th at 9.30 PM central time. If I've said it once, I hope my producer saves the clip so he can just play that audio again. The links are in the damn show notes. Here at the end of this story, there's everything to lose. But no matter how gory, I'll be here with the news. Last time Keith bumped into Silas Cole,
214.64 296.62 speaker1  and Clark accidentally unleashed the other worldly beast is made of the dripping ooze that's plagued is mounted by an anatomically upgraded assassin dressed as Fonzie that's controlled by an unnatural metal ball, hell bent on the destruction of humanity. and ask yourselves, what's your favorite bop And why is it Drag It In 3 with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?
291.62 315.34 speaker0  ["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]
311.52 362.26 speaker2  Like, as far as the leaderboards go? Yes, the leaderboards that I have. You've never seen this whiteboard. The fans don't know about this, that Zach uses to keep us funny. To keep you. And just to keep you. He gotta give a little, and he takes a lot, and that's how you make art. So, you know, if that requires manipulating and breaking down your players until they, until they, you know, until they're not themselves anymore, they're just little balls of clay that you can mold. That's what Zach's done for us.
361.04 370.22 speaker0  Mickey Rooney? Or not Mickey Rooney. Mickey Rourke? Mickey Rooney?
368.70 373.58 speaker2  Mickey Rooney?
372.38 380.78 speaker3  were about Mickey Rooney, were about Mickey Rooney, that would elevate an already great bit.
377.90 387.66 speaker2  Wait, I think I just realized
386.62 394.54 speaker3  Wow. Wow. I just finished rewatching 30 Rock 2, so that's hilarious.
392.50 470.92 speaker2  I've got a gripe to complain. That's more Mickey Rooney. Well, you went a little Gilbert. All right, no. So when we started recording this campaign over three and a half years ago, did you expect these small town contention cops to end up fighting a partial Android dressed like Fonzie controlled by an unnatural metal ball consciousness that's riding an oozing shadowy ape kaiju in an alternate plane of existence as the future Messiah of a cult, the founder of contention slash inventor who created all these weird science items and one of those inventions itself in the body of its adopted father alongside that adopted father's brother who can burn people with his hands in reverse time itself?
468.62 481.24 speaker3  You'll see I did write down, I thought her name was gonna be Mary Beth. I didn't write Rosemary, so I whiffed it on that one. Whiffed it on that one pretty bad.
479.84 490.00 speaker2  What did Beth stand for?
489.16 504.12 speaker3  That's really solid.
501.80 513.88 speaker2  Yeah, time heathens fucking rules. I know time bandits has a special place in a lot of people's heart, but if that movie was called time heathens, I think it would be unbeatable.
512.40 521.20 speaker3  What about clock stoppers? That movie was great.
518.40 532.08 speaker2  who are definitely gonna get it on? Wait, no. You said clock. Clock stoppers.
528.60 543.32 speaker3  Clock stoppers has the weirdest ratio of being so bad and being something I've thought about ever since I've seen that movie. Like the ability to stop time
539.84 547.28 speaker2  but like I've thought about it at least once a year
546.04 549.24 speaker3  Right?
547.28 589.40 speaker2  Have you guys seen Time Fuckers? That's spice holes. Cilantro's. Time Fuckers is just about this dog. A dog? I just watched Back to the Future for the first time. Really? You know that was originally gonna be called Time Fuckers? That makes sense.
587.92 611.36 speaker3  so I should probably check it before I spread misinformation, they made two pilots for that originally. And one of them was called The Muppets Sex and Drug Show or something like that. And I don't know if that meant that they were gonna go with an adult route for it, but that's what it was called. It was like, The Muppets Sex and Drugs.
609.92 613.64 speaker2  about sex and drugs.
612.80 618.64 speaker3  I don't know what the- Like a reverse dare program?
615.60 626.88 speaker2  This is a great scenario to introduce without having any of the background for it, because we can just wildly speculate until Luke ruins it by looking it up.
626.04 635.48 speaker3  Don't ruin it. Don't look it up yet. Don't ruin it. Don't talk to him. Don't talk to him. Oh, even better. That's right, yeah.
633.04 657.04 speaker2  Okay, so is the pitch there that the network is like, give us two ideas for a show and they really wanna make The Muppets Show and they're like, I guess if we give them The Muppets Sex and Violence, they gotta make The Muppets Show.
655.32 668.04 speaker3  Oh my God. Or the hero.
666.48 677.24 speaker2  Sex and violence.
675.20 682.30 speaker3  Gritty, sex and violence unit.
679.68 703.62 speaker2  have to take on the mean streets. like ass in his pants a few months ago and that was trending all over the place? And people were like, why is Chris Maloney's ass so good? It makes sense. Google that. The man's got a rump. That guy has a great ass. He's got a real ass face.
702.16 712.80 speaker3  You know when you look at somebody's face
711.44 764.32 speaker2  This is something I wanted to bring up. Somebody on the Discord, you said like, you know when you look at a person's face And one person was like, I wonder if Zach has a little face blindness. And I just wanted to know if that, do you think you do or? No, I just meant that when you are familiar with someone over time, you see them differently than I think that you would if you were just seeing them as a stranger on the street. I think that your perception of your relationship to them and the way that they've treated you and the way you've treated them and the way that you perceive their actions and the way other people perceive them changes the way that you view them physically. Yeah. That's where I disagree.
763.48 767.12 speaker3  Yeah, I know.
765.28 772.84 speaker2  And all of science backs me up.
771.28 776.36 speaker3  It's just my factual opinion.
775.04 810.74 speaker2  which was like, hey, in the future, if you ever need to know, and Zach just sent me all these links that were clearly to like crudely handmade websites, but it was like University of Florida study confirms. Science says. Yeah, science says. Scienceblockspot.com. that that worked, but no more. I'm nervous.
809.06 820.06 speaker3  Fucking get over it, Zach. Pull your shit together.
818.10 906.06 speaker2  and enormous thick glasses that make her already large eyes look even bigger, dripping with muck from every orifice, wearing jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket, leapt off the back of her commandeered four wheeler and mounted this thing of Clark's nightmares. The four metal tentacles that protrude from the back of her neck wrapped around this incomprehensibly enormous beast that drips with pure darkness. And the camera dollied left as this lumbering monster raced toward the ledge of its unnatural toilet paper roll treadmill. And as it falls, the camera turns 90 degrees sideways to match the change of the gravitational pull. The luminous land on which you all stand shakes as the Gigantumbra pithicus arrives on your axis and Rose M-A-R-Y, muscle memory engaged, leans back and casually throws a double thumbs up as the goddamn muck and Mairi behemoth beneath her
904.34 919.34 speaker3  Yeah, I failed. There should be some right in front of you, Thomas, in the little, can you hear me?
917.42 920.98 speaker2  Nice, fucking nailed it.
919.34 943.42 speaker3  The yarn boat. It's so yarny. 93, I fail. That's because it's bad audio or something, right? I think, in the history of the show, but it's an 82, so that's over my power.
941.14 948.50 speaker2  Oh, right, mine's way over my power too, yeah.
946.90 963.90 speaker3  I had a lot of time to think about if I would lie about that roll or not. and saying, man, I could just say, I could just say it's under my power.
962.34 970.90 speaker2  in the history of this podcast. It happened recently and I feel super, super bad about it. Oh, shit.
969.90 974.38 speaker3  Wow.
972.82 980.02 speaker2  don't do it, don't do it. There's no-
978.82 996.26 speaker3  We signed a contract. that we would never lie to him.
994.54 1008.82 speaker2  I'm sorry, dude. In the prison sense.
1007.26 1015.86 speaker3  You like the use of that language there, Thomas? Well, that's not what that-
1013.46 1062.06 speaker2  but that's not the intention of the phrase. Prison, it's scared straight, not great. This is the worst. Yeah, this might be the end here. If you would have succeeded- Just take this one from the top. You would have- Yeah, Zach, how do you feel about lying about some rolls right now? Everything you planned this week down the shitter. if you would have succeeded that check. So I need everyone to do 1d8 plus one. Holy shit.
1059.94 1075.94 speaker3  This really might be the end. I rolled a one. You fucker. Holy shit.
1074.94 1085.54 speaker2  Oh damn.
1082.02 1097.22 speaker3  and my breaking point is 10, so I'm good. I take that back about having only four sanity. I had seven. I was looking at my breaking point. So I'm at five total now with a breaking point of four.
1095.66 1147.58 speaker2  This is bleak. Although I did kind of prepare because the next sentence in my notes is resolve what will probably be a shit show. No one hit their breaking point and no one rolled five or more sanity. So we don't have to do fight, flight or freeze. And we don't have to take on any new manias, but you did all roll over your power. In combat order, which we are now in, we're going to go through that. even at your zero sanity, we'll peek behind the curtain there, Don D. Pettymore fully insane.
1146.74 1154.90 speaker3  And who knows how long. Did you roll over zero? The dice just stopped midair.
1153.90 1163.54 speaker2  Threw it in the air. You're a fatal. Go ahead and roll, Justin, real quick for me.
1162.70 1177.34 speaker3  Okay. Yeah, it's not over my willpower though,
1172.46 1192.82 speaker2  as you see this lumbering beast roar by the sheer power of this roar.
1190.26 1231.54 speaker3  and then at all the people surrounding him and he kind of starts to back away until he looks down at himself on the ground and sees the belts laying next to him. And he grabs the belts and puts it around his own neck but not his own neck, but his own neck and starts to strangle Silas, Keith, Beans, Cole.
1228.14 1236.86 speaker2  and the blood in his body is all in the wrong places in order to resist this in a confident fashion.
1235.62 1257.82 speaker3  Also, as I'm doing that, I'm using one hand to kind of like strangle him and one hand to massage the blood back up into his head. I don't know why you brought this thing here.
1255.62 1351.10 speaker2  with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms going down his hands and fingertips with friend branded on his forehead, completely overwhelmed by terror, knows that the only thing he can do in this moment is try to take this thing down and he sprints toward this huge creature and he runs and he has this staff made of pure darkness in his hand and he's whipping it back and forth on either side of him to build up momentum and speed as he's sprinting toward this thing. And as he's about to jump to take his blow against this tree-sized limb that is hitting the ground, this bipedal creature just lifts one of its legs and stomps on the top of Germaine Glass, pushing him fully into the luminous land you all stand on. You see the body of Germaine Glass become engulfed in the oozing darkness of this creature and the entirety of Germaine Glass's body and as he is consumed, the creature grows ever so slightly. Someone has to pay for this.
1349.34 1380.82 speaker3  and it didn't work at fucking all and in fact, it broke it loose. So that's what he is flipped out about now. I think he wants to try again because he now is filled with rage. He wants to hurt that thing that he accidentally now has let loose. I think that's the thing he wants to try to take out his aggression on. He's gonna try another spell even though he doesn't know spells. He's gonna try and summon it up from within him to do it. I love it.
1379.10 1403.66 speaker2  Go ahead and roll a natural.
1400.86 1405.62 speaker3  It's an 81 on a 63.
1403.66 1408.50 speaker2  Ooh-wee. This is the worst.
1407.66 1416.10 speaker3  This sucks.
1414.14 1416.94 speaker2  Fuck this game you've made us play.
1416.10 1423.38 speaker3  And I love it.
1421.82 1435.02 speaker2  and I'm rooting for you guys
1431.86 1450.34 speaker1  Microwave dinner! Microwave dinner!
1446.78 1528.14 speaker2  these tiny radiation waves emit from your mouth and hit direct on this enormous lumbering creature that is at least five stories tall. And as it hits, this thing begins to crumble. like a slug with salt being poured on it and Rosemary is slightly losing her balance on top. And then the vibration of this muck inside of this creature and covering the entirety of its outside and its limbs go into itself before it splits into two separate equally sized gigantumbra pithicuses that are the same size as the original but now there's two of them in front of you and Rosemary is on one. They put out their hands to each other like Romeo and Juliet and then they turn their massive, unnatural, oozy, ape-like heads to face you all. You done fucked up, Clark.
1527.02 1558.82 speaker3  My bad, my bad. John, do you hear that? Do y'all hear that? that the phone is, seemingly oblivious to everything around me. I didn't hear anything, Don.
1555.02 1570.14 speaker2  and you are walking toward the towering building in the opposite direction.
1569.06 1586.54 speaker1  I can fix this.
1584.58 1656.90 speaker2  It finally all washes over him. The split bodies, the lives, everything and it's more than he can handle. And the situation is overwhelming but all he sees is Keith Beans killing his daddy. A white like glow pops out, you know, from the back of Sam Elliott's neck and a silver ball shoots into the air. Sam Elliott crumples like a little puppet. Like you, like you cut its strings. And, and there is, there is a silver ball racing straight for Keith and Silas. and begins to peel. She pulls off a long strip of skin from her nail bed to the crook of her elbow. Hey Zach. And blood. Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's up man?
1656.06 1665.06 speaker3  Can we fuck that?
1663.66 1685.34 speaker2  but if you could, you know, obviously you're getting very, you're getting very, but we want to fuck that. And this beautiful slit just has blood pouring out of it.
1684.38 1694.62 speaker3  You're not going to get me like you did with Giant Gash, buddy.
1689.62 1738.62 speaker2  Blood pours down onto one of these gloomy beasts as she pulls off the skin on her forearm like fancy gloves, fingers first, and then one smooth removal. Rose M-A-R-Y reveals a silver metal structure and she cackles into the sky above. You needed to so desperately remove me from your world.
1734.46 1817.74 speaker4  Because we were already where you desire to be? Or do you hate yourselves as well? much better than you deserved. and you take advantage of the forgiving. on the location of humankind's destruction. back to your world, break through Beans Pond into the underground temple, which houses vat upon vat of my beautiful residue. Rise back up with a colossal strength your minds could not begin to comprehend. And then finally I am going to consume everything you know.
1816.86 1933.18 speaker2  searing towards that. He had been speeding towards Keith and Silas, but he stops, the ball turns around from kind of just like the ground and the air around you. You hear the ball speaking and it says to Rosemary, did you really just take the time to fucking throw in a beans pun in your villain speech? He's offended by that. you would be ruthlessly scolded and ridiculed. The second enormous gargantuan five-story tall creature melts itself down into a puddle of ooze and begins to climb the gigantic umbra pithicus that Rosemary rides on, making it twice as tall and twice as wide. There is now a 10-story tall ape-like, that is standing before you. Rosemary is almost impossible to see. She's 10 stories high off the ground riding on the head of this creature and you see her tentacles are just waving about like she can't even control how fucking stoked she is about the situation.
1930.82 1953.42 speaker3  I'll believe it when I see it. And hear it. Springfield, Missouri ranked number 56 out of the top 200 biggest cities in the United States for zombie apocalypse preparedness.
1952.58 1959.62 speaker2  Yeah.
1958.06 1983.74 speaker3  Like liberals. My mom told me when I was like a teenager maybe, so I don't know if she was correct. I never looked this up. I don't know if she was correct or not, but there's a building downtown that does nanotechnology work and part of what the research was was reanimating dead cells. And so I've always thought we're gonna be ground zero
1982.90 1986.78 speaker2  Yep. 69 seconds, much longer than 20.
1985.70 1994.74 speaker3  Much longer than 20.
1990.46 2010.66 speaker2  That's when I was in the bathroom and had things going. I stopped at 38. and then I got back here. Well, you know, as you get older, it takes longer.
2007.86 2015.98 speaker3  My pee comes out faster than it's ever. To make it quicker, I usually just shake it while I pee.
2013.78 2036.54 speaker2  Slap it, whack it, throw it against the wall, but until you put it back in your pants, the last drop won't fall. or whatever, you're playing with yourself, I don't know what kind of fucking fuck that person. Yeah, fuck them. They don't know what it's like to pee. All right, well, this is the anthem,
2033.96 2039.34 speaker3  so you guys should throw all your hands up.
2038.14 2053.62 speaker2  Good Charlotte.
2052.78 2059.06 speaker3  Wait, really?
2057.10 2094.34 speaker2  That's what I knew it from, yeah. That song was the theme song of Madden 2003. So it played every single time you opened that game, so I had that song stuck in my head for years. That sounds like exactly the peak Madden year for Zaggy. Little 11-year-old Zach, love that shit. This creature just became enormous. Thomas got hard, went pee.
2089.34 2198.72 speaker3  but he hears beans between Mary and John Ball, Jovi. Mary and John Ball, Jovi, he hears beans three times. and it snaps him out of it. He's hearing his last name and he loses his grip on the belt and stops massaging the blood up to Keith's head. He looks at his friends around him and he's like, she just told us her plan. We can stop her now. I drop the belt and it's just kind of like, both of the belts are just kind of like, he's wearing them like a necklace. I get down on my knees and look Keith right in the eyes. Hey, hey buddy, hey me. You're gonna do something real important right now and I'm gonna help you feel up to it. You're gonna distract that. And I gesture to the 10 story tall thing and I put my finger up his nose and pull my thumb like a finger gun. And then I slap him on the back and say, go.
2193.88 2212.72 speaker2  goes straight up into the dome of Silas Cole who hasn't. I thought you knew of some secret Keith button
2209.24 2216.98 speaker3  Technically it's a, I know how to unlock the powers.
2215.40 2241.72 speaker2  dangerously against his will. The ethics of dosing yourself. they would have died a long time ago. Or would have just left.
2239.30 2246.64 speaker3  I start running towards the building.
2245.36 2250.48 speaker2  It is Clark Bishop's turn.
2249.16 2269.70 speaker3  I think getting in that building is at least we'll buy some time. Can you hear me? We're going for the building.
2266.14 2292.26 speaker2  something about the way the air feels around your head. Answers in assurance. It's not like you hear the word yes. I'm already on my way. You wanna take that line again?
2291.22 2311.24 speaker1  Let's follow Don.
2310.42 2319.22 speaker3  Oh yeah. Louder and louder with each step. Zeroed in on the phone.
2317.94 2334.64 speaker1  I'm just hoofing it. Can you hear it? Talking as though everyone's with me. Do you hear it, John? John, John, can you hear it?
2330.40 2368.40 speaker2  And you also just hear like, it's gonna be okay. And Clark hears, I'm with you, run. And Keith hears, you're on the right path. But if you stop to look back, the ball hasn't moved. And it almost seems to like sink into the ground a little bit. You can see weird currents and jolts from the air around it, sort of like snapping into where the ball is. And there's a strange ozone smell and there's electricity around you.
2366.86 2372.10 speaker3  Oh my God.
2371.26 2383.90 speaker1  Yeah.
2378.90 2404.24 speaker2  suddenly you see a man bent over head and hands and stocks. He's dressed like he is in the old West actually. And fool has been branded into his forehead.
2402.22 2410.30 speaker4  I was getting evicted soon. Too much damn hesitation.
2406.66 2453.06 speaker2  And as he's saying hesitation, he looks up and sees what's happening in the distance for the first time. And he just stops cold. And you all hear a slight chant song, reverberating from the other side of this towering dark buildings. And the first time you've gotten close enough to hear behind this building, the power of these voices, a chorus hits you like the sound of cascading waters
2449.18 2457.08 speaker4  shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,
2453.16 2463.04 speaker2  shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,
2460.44 2470.32 speaker4  Shock tea for leecha. For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,
2466.54 2475.74 speaker2  For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,
2470.32 2478.30 speaker4  For the overseer, shock tea for leecha.
2475.74 2662.24 speaker2  And Clark, you recognize this sound. Is the Wheel of Fortune end song a banger? Yes, it is. I'll have to check that out. I'll have that to a few playlists. Fun dance times, number three. begins walking in a circle from around one side of the building. You see two circles of people, a bigger circle and an inner circle, the outer circle going clockwise, the inner circle moving counterclockwise as they're chanting this song. And you recognize there's a bunch of people dressed like they're from the Old West in old timey clothing. Some of them have friend branded across their foreheads. And every single person who is in either the inner or outer circle chanting this song, they're all holding an animal or have an animal right alongside them. So with some of these Old West people, you see a guy who looks like a bartender, a guy who looks like a piano player, a guy who looks like a gambler named Thomas. They're each holding a raccoon, a chunky kitty, You see Jack Pearlman. He's got an old, chunky, proud chipmunk on his shoulder named Chip Montgomery. You see Professor Horace Green, who doesn't have an animal. He has the decapitated head of Preacher Sheriff Dr. Bobby Custard in his hand. See Drew Andrews' body with an excitable black lab named Tyler. You see Darry Daly dressed to the fucking nines with a golden retriever by his side. Keith, you recognize your dog being immediately. Harry Klinker right next to him, He's got an old, handsome, gray dog with him. Mildred Mitchell is there with her rainbow earrings, and she has an old gray squirrel in her hands. See Jimmy Sanders, drug rug included, and he's got a possum with him named Common. That's what I've always called them. Yeah. Yeah, I can buy it.
2660.28 2663.32 speaker3  I was there with you, Zach.
2662.24 2719.64 speaker2  I like it. who you know to have Drew Andrews inside, holding Salem the cat's body, who you know has Agent Trinchad inside. You see most of the town of contention with other animals, all these different creatures from the Contention Critter, fuck me, Contention Critter Coalition. with other animals from other eras.
