0.00 197.48 speaker0  Hello my cast and crew and adoring audience. It's your theater director that brings that sweet sweet nectar, Wolf the dog. And you know I'm blocking all the scenes here in contention from 694.2 PTBP like I always do my babies. This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener who tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter. And your buddy Wolf appreciates that so fucking much y'all. He writes. Hello Mr. Wolf. My name is Eidos Fillmore and I'm a proud but concerned resident of 45 years here in contention. First, I don't actually understand the program that follows your fine program. I have no idea. What I do have an idea about are all the pets going missing lately. Hell, the families on my block are missing the dogs and the cats. Sir, you're a deputy. Don't you have better things to be doing? And then this fella Deputy Vigna coming home like some goddamn prodigal son. Except he ain't no prodigal and we all wish he would have stayed gone. I heard he almost laid hands on Leo Piston the day before he mysteriously goes missing. Sorry for the long note, Wolf. Signed, Eidos. Damn, Eidos. You bring up some solid complaints. Maybe we should do something about these stupid coppers. From what I can tell, the hip new spot for all the cool cats in contention is in the Wolf by tagging app pretending pod on social media or writing a five star review, screenshotting it and sending it to pretendingpod at gmail dot com. But either way, isn't it about time you left us a review? You know what makes Wolf the dog feel so good. I want to bathe in your five stars, my babies, help your little wolfy boy get all squeaky clean. However, now it's time to dig up some dirt. It's the news. The officers were last seen causing a fatal car crash. A minivan was run off the road by Officer Betty Moore, a former teen sprint car racer who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized. The minivan flipped and caught fire. Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage. The boy is at the clinic in critical condition. The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and the other passenger who were both trapped in the vehicle. The vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose and the memories of a particularly traumatic childhood Christmas y'all.
192.08 225.48 speaker1  All I want for Christmas is kudzoo with no backbone. Who did the scoop?
217.72 246.84 speaker2  If you had the opportunity to have this magical ability, which is anytime you were done with a piece of clothing that you were wearing, you could drop it on the floor and it would immediately be pressed and laundered and back in your chest of drawers or your closet like
242.84 249.56 speaker3  But in order to get this ability, you have to fuck a corpse.
248.56 251.56 speaker2  For how long? Okay, good question.
250.56 261.56 speaker3  To completion?
258.56 288.28 speaker2  How fresh or old is the corpse? The corpse is roughly your age. Uh, no.
287.28 334.00 speaker3  Right. It'd be harder to do. Or three years. Yeah. Right, okay, well that would be much harder. It'd be just like bones. I don't know. Rubbing your bones. I would fuck a six hour corpse. He just has dirt on his mouth. pressed, put away, but a random person in the world's like comparable outfit just bursts into flames.
331.00 335.00 speaker2  It's like the opposite of Tom's.
334.00 338.72 speaker3  Yeah. Like actually every time you do it, a pair of Toms.
337.72 351.12 speaker2  Disappears. Okay, so John, you are holding this wet black cat and you have just called it Doug and told it you would help him.
350.12 372.64 speaker3  I'm holding Doug. I didn't just call this cat Doug. This is basic.
370.64 374.64 speaker1  Radio?
372.64 388.52 speaker3  The radio turned you into this cat? Hey, I don't like, you guys see this, right? This cat is definitely, I'm talking to this cat. Is your name Doug? Yeah, that's a yes. Is your name Clark? Meow, meow. Okay, good. We've got the twos and the twos.
387.52 390.52 speaker2  No.
389.52 393.52 speaker3  Is two no? Meow. Is one yes?
392.52 395.52 speaker2  Meow.
394.52 404.06 speaker3  Meow. Meow. This is a smart cat because it's Doug. I have a quick question.
403.06 406.50 speaker2  Meow.
404.06 416.42 speaker3  Doug, do you know how this happened to you? So you could turn, you could fix it?
413.22 422.00 speaker1  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
416.42 472.86 speaker2  As you guys are talking to this cat, a crowd of people show up. They're standing around. Many of them have their phones up and are taking videos. And a young girl walks up to go ahead and roll luck against each other and see who rolls the lowest or goes over the most. And Drew jumps into the back of Officer Vigno's cruiser.
471.54 505.02 speaker3  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. I also get into my cruiser. We saved one of the kids. Meow? Not let, it just happened near us. Don't worry, Doug. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. Nothing's gonna happen to you. Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
504.02 536.78 speaker2  more dead kid. I just, I saw a lot of weird shit today, I'm just trying to make up. That's true, we all have. We're talking to a cat right now. pupils and it jumps out of your hands, John, and it jumps into Clark's lap and looks back at you fearfully before its eyes move back into slits.
535.78 541.78 speaker3  It's okay, Doug.
540.10 550.14 speaker1  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
549.14 553.46 speaker3  Yeah. Would you like us to switch your body? I think we have the technology.
552.46 582.10 speaker2  That's it. Meow. You guys roll up to the station and outside of the police station there is a group of people holding up signs. They're walking around in a big circle and they seem to be chanting something along the dicks.
579.30 589.74 speaker3  If only they knew that had actually happened to one of us earlier. Hey, that's not funny.
584.34 627.04 speaker2  There's a sign that says, justice for Tilde B in all caps. Another says, where is Leo Piston? One of the protesters is just holding up a tablet with a video of Officer Pettymore firing into the air and yelling at civilians. More signs say, that's completely taken out of context. Wow. The one that shot the gun and disappeared. That is correct.
626.04 642.42 speaker3  Okay. Oh shit. The woman across the street from John Peters house's daughter. Milgram Mitchell. Milgram Mitchell. Oh it was Milgram Mitchell. If Maggie had been here, she would have been having press conferences and I guess assuring people that we had it under control.
639.22 769.32 speaker2  I guess we forgot the public relations part of our job. Whoever has the highest humant, who is that? Me. Can you go ahead and roll humant for me? That's a crit success. Drew is so nervous right now. He is fiddling with his thumbs. He's not holding eye contact with anyone. He's trying to avoid any conversation. the cat of another cat and there's the people inside a cat and there's cats inside people and there was a body from old and a body from new and there's just a lot of stuff going on right now and I'm freaking out man. This is crazy. Go ahead and roll persuade. Do you think that'll help? Oh, that can't hurt. So you pull up into the parking lot and Drew hops out. You guys can hear him. I'm assuming you guys dip into the police station. Immediately.
767.28 777.24 speaker3  Drew, was there a mob here when you left?
772.24 790.48 speaker2  Guys, I've been kind of overwhelmed recently and I mean, Florence hasn't checked in today at all and you know, I'd figured she'd be helping out with, I don't know, here.
787.12 797.24 speaker3  I need you to keep it together today. You understand?
795.60 894.64 speaker2  Who's Florence? 15. Florence is the police officer that works alongside you guys in contention. You rolled a 15? On a 40 or 50. Okay, so he calms down and he's like, okay, well this is, this is hard and I wanted to, you know, tell you guys over time, you know, maybe this would all kind of fade away, but and he reaches over his desk and he grabs this sheet of paper. He hands it to you guys and it says, remember to tell the guys at the top and then it lists off like 20 names as missing persons and roughly 100 phone calls about the animals in the water. There's also just a section heading called complaints and it has more tallies than you could possibly care to count. The last thing on the list just says feds left a message. Who left a message? What did the feds say? Drew? Let me find it.
893.56 908.20 speaker3  That much is apparent.
905.12 913.68 speaker2  Chief cookie has typically kept everything together. She keeps me on time.
911.64 919.44 speaker1  She would never let it get out of hand like this.
918.44 928.20 speaker3  the public? Yeah, buddy. What would chief do? What would chief do? What would chief do?
925.64 936.84 speaker2  We've never dealt with anything like this before.
934.28 1022.60 speaker3  and that cat man, a nice hot cup of coffee. list. I know he would. You would have been on the ball. This isn't your fault. This is Florence's fault. Where is he? Are you okay, John? Yeah, I mean, because I'm being nice to you? No, it's just that Florence is a woman. All right, well, maybe we'll ask her. Is that part of the process of getting you switched? Meow. Okay. Is it safe for me to touch it? Meow. Okay. I'm going to set Doug down and go back to the lockers and get the radio out. He follows you. Okay. I want to take the radio. The radio has a red light showing on it. I want to take the radio, go back to the cells, and set it on the outside of the cells. Okay. Dr. Marie Jacobs. Doc, somebody here you may or may not be happy to see. She's asleep and she kind of wakes up.
1021.60 1029.92 speaker1  Oh. I just assumed the tar would have gotten him by now.
1028.92 1041.56 speaker3  Whatever. Is that what you call the goo? We've been calling it goo. I just had never heard anybody refer to it other than us.
1038.96 1045.00 speaker1  I fear I've spoken out of turn.
1042.56 1051.00 speaker3  Well, we're going to put your husband back in his body. Yeah. No. Ma'am, I know.
1050.00 1062.56 speaker1  I want to go home. You should just let me go home with the man that I have now.
1061.56 1082.40 speaker3  Done. You don't have to let him come with you. and maybe you two have a lot to work out, you know? He can get a hotel, but he does need his body back, doctor. No. No. Why would you even think that was a possibility? Why? I bought the radio.
1081.40 1090.54 speaker1  I wanted to do it to the same ones.
1086.60 1122.92 speaker3  I don't think there's a law on the books, but I know you can't radio your husband into a cat and keep him trapped there for the rest of his life. I haven't thought about it that much. How old's your cat? You haven't thought about this at all, man. I certainly don't know the rules. The rules are that you can't do this.
1118.52 1132.16 speaker2  I get the keys and open up the cell, get the husband out, and keep her in there and lock it back. Yeah. That can go off without much of a head show. What's he wearing?
1130.56 1143.58 speaker3  Or maybe a cartoon cat? I hope it was a cartoon cat. Pepe Le Pew. Pepe Le Pew.
1138.68 1177.16 speaker2  He also has a black collar around his neck, and he's got dried blood kind of still around his mouth, but he's licked everything else clean. There's only one way to find out. I don't trust this cat. Roll cat intelligence. I don't want to turn into a cat standing here. I don't either.
1173.96 1180.24 speaker3  We're going to have to try to persuade her to tell us how this happened and how this
1178.16 1183.28 speaker2  Or we'll keep her locked here forever.
1181.24 1208.32 speaker3  Yeah, hey, 30 people are missing in contention. Nobody's going to miss one more. We can go that route with it. We can go pretty dark, or we can... Shut up, Dr. Jacobs. 30 people disappeared in contention. It would be easy for one more to go missing. Now we're trying to think of how we're going to convince you. I wouldn't. 30 people have gone missing in contention.
1207.32 1211.32 speaker1  It just happened.
1210.32 1228.16 speaker3  What did the goo do? The goo just ran out. Followed the cat. Ma'am, we will let you free right now. Okay. With your cat body, husband. Or with your man body cat. Okay.
1227.16 1233.12 speaker1  Wait, no, that... No, because if I tell you how it happened, you're just going to use it.
1231.64 1243.20 speaker3  No, we're really scared to use it. Okay, which one of you has a better persuade?
1242.20 1270.12 speaker2  I have a 60. All right, roll it up, Keith. A 70 on a 70. Oh, that's a success. Yes. Okay.
1268.48 1288.08 speaker3  Uh, gross, first of all. I didn't know they let you listen to that in contingent. It's national. Well, they got some good stories on there, Jon.
1286.60 1291.60 speaker2  Do you believe her?
1290.08 1314.44 speaker3  I think it's hilarious she believed us. I'll do it. Okay. All right. Okay. I pat him on the back. Thanks for taking this one, man.
1313.44 1315.44 speaker2  Probably not.
1314.44 1317.68 speaker3  Oh, you can do the interrogation room?
1316.68 1323.56 speaker2  Perfect. I bring the cat and Doug's body into the interrogation room.
1321.20 1335.92 speaker3  Me and you are on the other side of the two-way mirror. Yep. Clark, Clark, either way, this could go real good for us.
1334.92 1337.92 speaker2  Sure.
1336.92 1349.76 speaker3  Oh, sorry. We can also check with the cat if that what she just told us is how it happened. Oh, shit. Yeah. I've beeped in through the intercom on the two-way mirror.
1348.76 1364.80 speaker2  Cool. Okay. So Doug, I need you to sit on the table and then I'm gonna have your body sit right here.
1361.36 1374.52 speaker3  I come into the interrogation room and I just kind of crack the door open and toss it in and close it real quick. Then I get back behind the two-way mirror.
1373.52 1385.36 speaker2  Salem. It's a big radio. Like...
1384.36 1386.36 speaker3  You can...
1385.36 1400.84 speaker2  Like one of those big old, like... Yeah, it's big. Like you would be able to carry it, but it would, it would be a lug. Yeah, it's awkward. Okay. What light is on? If I press buttons on it, does anything change? Or turn it into not dials?
1399.84 1404.84 speaker3  I peep the intercom. Uh, Keith, do you plug it in?
1403.84 1432.68 speaker2  I plug it in. 91.1. Red. I turn it to literally every station. The light's just red. The radio's on, though, right? Just left it on? It's on, yeah. I turned it on and pressed all the buttons, so.
1431.68 1443.16 speaker3  We got shit to do. Let's leave them in here if we fire our eyes and see if we come back with them switched. Could work. What if they switch and re-switch several times, though, and they're trapped in there? We could just ask Doug and see if it happened.
1442.16 1457.32 speaker2  Some kind of hell. You know, once we get back, we can say, hey, did you switch and switch back? Like some kind of hell. We found Doug.
1455.88 1461.88 speaker3  when I shot those bullets off, so. No. No, I think that would only exacerbate things.
1460.56 1465.52 speaker2  Okay, how do we deal with this, then?
1464.52 1489.44 speaker3  With the camera. Can you remember anything we did that made those lights turn on? they turned on. Tell me a scary story. hair tingle stand up on the back of our necks, we can. What if Doug's body runs away, though? Oh, we got that toy. Oh, what if we- No, I don't.
1488.44 1498.44 speaker2  That's not letting it work. What if we try to get the doctor to do it? She probably won't do it, though. She won't do it. What if we tell her we're gonna, I don't know, threaten her to-
1494.16 1506.92 speaker3  Oh, hey, let's go ask her how, what color the light was and how, what the circumstances were that it turned on. There we go. I go back to the doctor.
1505.28 1524.68 speaker1  Didn't work, did it? I saw you bring that radio out here. I saw the light was red.
1523.68 1529.64 speaker2  No.
1528.44 1549.00 speaker3  about the tar. Well, cause no ooze radio. There was ooze coming out of the camera. It came out of the picture. Or I was holding it from the camera.
1548.00 1558.00 speaker2  So- It was dripping from both. Yeah.
1553.64 1569.96 speaker3  Maybe just leave it on and see what happens when we get back some time later. Maybe we should, cause what, I mean, actually the potential consequences of that are-
1568.96 1578.60 speaker2  Radios? I mean, this isn't just a radio though.
1576.84 1619.76 speaker3  So we should turn the radio off. We have to take the picture to get it to go. I'm sorry. This is Thomas speaking. This is John speaking. I think we should all lock them up in that cell and let them spend some quality time with each other. And Dr. Jakes seems to fucking hate that guy and I'm not a big fan of hers right now cause she's not a whole lot of help. Maybe we'll come back and they're like screaming and she's like, meow, meow. No, I think the cat can just have free. I like that cat. His name is Doug. I want Doug to not be stuck with her. I think you're right.
1618.76 1627.88 speaker2  That's true. Okay, so let's lock the cat man back up and then put the radio back in the-
1625.40 1640.52 speaker3  Let's put the cat man in a different cell so she can't be by it. Give him a little time apart to think about things. I like that. Yeah.
1638.44 1644.44 speaker2  You're letting Doug come with you guys.
1643.44 1678.48 speaker3  Yeah. Gotcha. Doug, do you want to be our sidekick? Meow, meow. Anything about the ooze? What happened to the chief? Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow. What's going on with the ooze?
1672.08 1701.38 speaker2  head up and then it falls on its back and it like widens its eyes really big and starts moving its paws around and then it flips back over on top of itself and then it looks right behind it and it like freaks out and jumps up in the air and then it starts running, right? And then it runs over to the sink in the kitchen that you guys have in the station and it like paws at the water. The ooze is afraid of water? Meow.
1700.38 1749.18 speaker3  That's why the animals are in the creek. The ooze is killed by water. Meow, meow. Meow, meow. We don't know, but the ooze does not lack the water. Meow. So we're making a run to Walmart and getting a bunch of super soakers. Water balloons. Oh my God. Those guys are such assholes, but maybe we have to call the contention fire department. Those pricks, every time they win softball, they're just dicks.
1748.18 1760.02 speaker2  It's impossible.
1756.98 1771.46 speaker3  This feels like we're moving towards a final game plan. Really?
1770.46 1788.02 speaker2  Is it afraid of water? Oh yeah.
1787.02 1800.14 speaker3  My mom, my mom, my mom. Should we go to the mill?
1799.14 1810.58 speaker2  It was James's.
1809.58 1825.02 speaker3  It was James. He worked at the mill. He was last seen going into Maggie Cook's house. The one who ate his own foot or the chief's foot or the one who... Oh, he's the galoshes guy.
1824.02 1832.86 speaker2  Yep. Already. And then he was the one with the bullet in his head sitting at the dinner table. Yeah.
1831.86 1852.26 speaker3  Doug, can you hold down the fort? Meow. Okay. We could leave him a little tray of water and... That's stupid for me. So rude. Hey, Drew, this is Doug. Doug, Drew. Meow.
1849.34 1862.52 speaker2  His voice gets normal for a second.
1861.52 1868.16 speaker3  Just trust us on this. I mean, have we steered you wrong yet? I will.
1867.16 1872.84 speaker1  You got it, bud. I pat him on the back.
1871.84 1874.84 speaker2  Bubble gum tree. Bubble gum tree.
1873.84 1878.32 speaker3  Yeah, bubble gum tree. You could have just told that to the clones.
1877.32 1882.20 speaker1  I'll get it next time.
1881.20 1888.20 speaker2  My phone starts ringing? And he's like, oh, okay, good. It's you.
1886.20 1897.60 speaker3  You're so funny, John.
1892.88 1931.56 speaker2  On your way to James the millworker's house, it's in the suburbs. And on your way there, looking up into the sky on this chilly moonlit night, you see a crop duster flying with sparkly lights all over the wings and tail. And behind it is a massive banner that reads in bright lights, contention PD equals imbeciles.
1930.56 1937.32 speaker3  That's impressive. That's impressive, though. I got to give it up to whoever ordered that plane.
1936.32 1939.40 speaker2  Is it Harry?
1938.00 1945.80 speaker3  Can I call Harry real quick?
1944.80 1950.80 speaker2  and you hear. Clark. Hey. Hey, Harry.
1949.80 1969.44 speaker3  How you doing? I'm well. You, uh, you seen all that rabble outside? People seem pretty mad at us. You know about that? Yeah. I was hoping you might be able to put out the good word amongst the patrons there that maybe we're onto something here and have some patience for us.
1965.56 1987.76 speaker0  You know, uh, Klinker's is always a safe place for you and your kind. I was just... I met you and, uh, the other officers. Not bishops.
1984.20 1996.40 speaker3  all the stupid pigs and blah, blah, blah, you might tell them that we're just some good old friends of yours and that you trust us and that maybe...
1995.40 2001.44 speaker0  and, uh...
1997.40 2006.44 speaker3  I've got an idea about another phone call we could make because I'm, I'm, this is, this seems to have been... Oh, are we still on the call? Sorry, John was talking.
2005.44 2011.44 speaker1  Uh, hey Harry.
2010.44 2040.24 speaker3  Tell Harry I say hi. How long have we been playing this game? Uh... Three days. what we can to help out the town. I appreciate that, Clark.
2037.94 2044.28 speaker2  That's not me though, because I don't think he likes me that much.
2042.56 2053.28 speaker3  Well, he said it earlier. He did. Okay, edit that part out.
2050.28 2056.28 speaker2  Edit that part out, edit out the part when he said it earlier.
2054.28 2075.28 speaker3  Hey guys, I think we should call the pastor.
2074.28 2079.28 speaker2  Who's calling the pastor?
2078.28 2105.28 speaker3  I'll call the pastor. Bring, bring. Bring, bring. Uh, this is John Lee Pettymore III from Contention PD. Uh, just wanted to talk to you when you have a moment. Thank you. Bye.
2104.28 2112.28 speaker2  Have a blessed day. That was good.
2110.28 2144.28 speaker3  like he can get this town going. He's got the resources and Keith did so horribly insult him and steal his helmet.
2143.28 2148.28 speaker2  I'm pretty sure. I don't think it would even be... Prove it.
2147.28 2176.28 speaker3  Yeah, prove it.
2173.28 2197.28 speaker2  Actually, the only reason I have back problems is... Dude, you know how I make my penis eight inches long? That would mean I have a flaccid 16 inch penis.
2193.28 2201.28 speaker3  I'm not going to try right now, but I don't think even totally soft I could fold my penis in half.
2198.28 2207.28 speaker2  Oh, well then my penis is bigger than yours.
2205.28 2213.28 speaker3  I don't think it's pliable enough to... I think mine would.
2212.28 2216.28 speaker2  Can you guys go wash your hands? I can do it. I can do it.
2215.28 2217.28 speaker3  I folded my penis in half.
2216.28 2219.28 speaker2  Okay.
2217.28 2228.28 speaker3  I took a shower right before I came over here. It was actually really easy. I guess a soft dick is very soft.
2226.28 2243.28 speaker2  I like to tie mine in a ribbon. Well, we're in your cruiser.
2242.28 2245.28 speaker3  I don't know if you're driving.
2244.28 2248.28 speaker2  Yeah, I think I said that I was. I was sick of you. Are you driving?
2247.28 2250.28 speaker3  Okay.
2249.28 2262.28 speaker2  And you guys are having this conversation. Clark just wrapped up a phone call and then John called the pastor twice and left a message.
2260.28 2265.28 speaker3  We can only incite this mob.
2262.28 2280.28 speaker2  Yeah, well then what do we do?
2277.28 2314.28 speaker3  folks at contention, I think that'll get them out of the streets. I agree. pet and telling them to get their ass down to the creek. And also, fuck, we need to... You know what? Okay. Hold up. We talked a little bit earlier about telling everybody to get into a bathtub full of water.
2313.28 2319.28 speaker2  And it would.
2316.28 2320.28 speaker3  They could get in the creek with the animals and have a little animal party.
2319.28 2338.28 speaker2  Oh shit, it's December though. You think it's going to get pretty cold in these next couple days. How about this? Let's see if we have some funds put back to buy big kiddie pools for contention.
2337.28 2347.28 speaker3  That is not in the budget.
2346.28 2352.28 speaker2  Guns. And white gold, if you know what I'm talking about. Keith!
2350.28 2359.28 speaker3  We're police. With no money.
2358.28 2370.28 speaker2  I'm not comfortable with this.
2369.28 2376.28 speaker3  If you say so. I do say so.
2374.28 2380.28 speaker2  Well, okay, pass that over here.
2379.28 2386.28 speaker3  Three hours.
2384.28 2389.28 speaker2  Do I get a bonus if I take a bump?
2388.28 2397.28 speaker3  But I don't know.
2391.28 2404.28 speaker2  Keith, because he's only at one willpower, his cocaine habit just negates. My minus 20. So yeah, I toss the baggie over to you.
2403.28 2418.28 speaker3  That guy never shuts up. He's just talking and talking and talking. Is he on cocaine? Four. Alright, get four willpower back. That helps a lot. Oh, wait. I don't know.
2417.28 2423.28 speaker2  I went from six to ten. I'm back up to one, correct? That is correct. Math.
2422.28 2427.28 speaker3  Oh, I did not...
2426.28 2432.28 speaker2  Yeah, you should be at 20 health. But I got one willpower. Cool.
2430.28 2442.28 speaker3  I'm stink eyeing the hell out of him from the backseat. Thank you. I don't say anything though. Okay. Because me and Keith already had our peace on that.
2437.28 2449.28 speaker2  So you guys are doing cocaine and Clark is stink eyeing you. Not speaking a word. As you guys pull up...
2448.28 2452.28 speaker3  Bishop. Rolling eyes real hard. Hey, Bishop.
2451.28 2459.28 speaker2  Look at me, man. Tonight...
2457.28 2511.16 speaker3  And there is an evil loose in contention. I mean, it's not the time for procedure, buddy. You know what? is exactly the time for procedure. I roll down my window. Just listen to J.J. Kale, buddy.
2508.84 2541.00 speaker2  on speeding as fast as I can. Down the street that the house is on, where are you parking? Describe it. I go into the driveway at an angle and just keep going all the way up to where the passenger door of the police cruiser is like you need to take a step and a half to get into the front door.
2537.04 2556.20 speaker3  two shots in the air to disperse any potential crowds. People who actually do cocaine are like, you guys.
2553.64 2566.76 speaker2  Everyone rolls out, fires two shots in the air.
2564.60 2573.36 speaker3  Like any reaction?
2569.36 2583.24 speaker2  As you look about the neighborhood, go ahead and roll search for me.
2581.68 2586.36 speaker3  I probably just am normal.
2585.36 2613.52 speaker2  Gotcha. He gets to stand, he gets to stand up and talk and move around and stuff. Oh, that's correct. You're no longer. Because I did drugs. blue three piece suit.
2611.28 2648.32 speaker3  I got to point my gun right at him. lie to us. I'm the... I don't see any threat so I raise the gun.
2647.32 2674.36 speaker2  Oh. We're cops, not comedians. He's holding a cane that has a big tooth on the top where he's holding it. Like a fake tooth or a... A big fake tooth, like a giant that fits his entire fist. Right, like a just molar. Yeah, it's huge and it's on top of his cane and he...
2672.36 2681.60 speaker3  Hey buddy, what's up with your tooth cane?
2680.04 2698.28 speaker2  I don't see how that... Yeah, I don't... Are you hitting on us?
2696.36 2709.52 speaker3  Then it's got his phone number and his email. This is his email. Hey guys, I think the founder of the Contention Historical Society might be able to give us some clues. Do we still have those pictures? Or do we have... I'm talking to Zach.
2708.52 2713.52 speaker4  I'm not Zach. I'm Randy. I'm sorry, Randy.
2712.52 2743.24 speaker3  Who's Thomas? 69. Is it conceivable that we have copies of those pictures on our phones? Mr. Angst. Dr. Angst? DDS? It doesn't say DDS.
2742.24 2766.76 speaker4  You can just call me Randy. These aren't real doctors. Wow.
2765.52 2799.52 speaker3  You thought I came up with that? Oh, gosh. It's just a reference. I want to show you this picture right here.
2796.40 2812.20 speaker4  I think you might want to come in. I don't know if these pictures are spooky, but I can guarantee you, there's some spooky doings in this hoose. Hoose.
2811.20 2831.56 speaker3  Yeah. This whole town is beset with it. But do you recognize the building these people are standing in front of? And I show them the picture of the people in front of the jet black building.
2830.44 2838.44 speaker2  It's just a black wall. You can't actually see the building at large.
2835.76 2860.16 speaker3  Are they contention founders, forefathers?
2859.16 2873.36 speaker4  It means it was wrong.
2871.76 2878.26 speaker3  Who's wearing clothes that they shouldn't be?
2873.36 2905.36 speaker4  These three are wearing clothes from a different time period as the rest of them. Oh, a hundred years or so probably. This must be a reenactment of some sort. I'm a helpful guy. Just ask my lady friends. Mr. Anx. It's very cold out. You are quite old.
2904.36 2908.30 speaker3  Thank you.
2907.30 2918.78 speaker2  What is this guy's name? Randy? Randy Anx. Not waiting for him to get out of the way, I just kind of blow by him. Okay.
2917.78 2933.34 speaker3  Yeah. You're doing what he asked you to do.
2932.34 2949.94 speaker4  Yeah. And he always remembers. Do you remember? That song's a little after my time.
2948.14 2956.10 speaker3  He doesn't know September.
2955.10 3020.06 speaker4  Yes. It was not around for very long. at trivia. What about it? What is trivial? Well, everything. It opened. It closed. How quickly? Very quickly. I would say less than a year. What year? Oh, it was 25 years ago probably. She would have been... He would have... Either one of them would have been long dead by that point. The Coles? Yes. Oh, absolutely. Who named it for them? There are many things in our town named after our founder and his wife, Silas Cole and Mary Cole. I get that. I just wondered if you know who opened it. Wasn't this town founded by beans?
3019.06 3025.86 speaker3  Contention.
3024.86 3075.22 speaker4  Was it... Cornelius? Cornelius Beans. Oh, what a mind you have on you, young sir. I read a book or two. I believe you read the right ones. Do you remember where in contention Cole's orphanage was? Well, the town has changed quite a bit since then. I don't remember where it was now. We could probably find more back at my research facility. A resource facility? It's where all of my research is hosed. Sorry. It's where all of my research is hosed. Try it one more time. Yes, of course. It's where all of my research is hosed.
3071.42 3086.50 speaker3  That makes sense to me.
3083.02 3169.32 speaker2  And as you walk in there's a nice foyer in front of you. And then to the right there's this huge living room. And in the living room, well here in the foyer there is a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo. And also there is a suit of armor. And the helmet has been replaced with a white hard hat. In the living room there is an empty grand piano. And there's also a large oil painting of a red rose. And he brings you over to the statue of the man wearing a tuxedo. And he grabs the statue's bow tie and flips it. And the coffee table in the living room flips over showing an enormous stash of weapons, body armor, and a long plastic tube the size of a baseball bat. It's in a tube that size. There's an old drawing of, is that Old Bush Stadium? No. No that's New Bush.
3168.32 3170.80 speaker3  That's New Bush Stadium.
3169.32 3177.80 speaker2  It's a seat from Old Bush behind me. Not Cornelius, fuck.
3176.80 3179.80 speaker4  Ooh.
3178.80 3211.88 speaker3  Wait, is your name not Randy? No, it's Randy. No. Take some pictures real quick with our phones and then suit the fuck up with this shit. Yeah, I'm gonna put body armor, like weapons. Let's get loaded guys.
3210.88 3214.88 speaker2  Vital operations. Police purposes.
3213.88 3221.52 speaker3  Hey, the estate will be compensated.
3220.52 3222.52 speaker4  Oh, his will was very non-existent.
3221.52 3226.52 speaker3  Okay.
3225.52 3228.52 speaker2  The answer is a fucking no? Oh yeah.
3227.52 3238.32 speaker3  Hey man, I'm sorry. This is all part of an ongoing investigation. We're actually going to load some of this up in our cruiser right now so we can take it to evidence as quickly as possible.
3237.32 3243.32 speaker1  Oh good.
3242.32 3247.32 speaker4  I think so. Yeah. Hey Keith, give him, give him some of that.
3246.32 3248.32 speaker3  Just share your cocaine.
3247.32 3252.80 speaker2  Just kidding. We are police officers of the law.
3250.64 3262.84 speaker3  Keith, this is the end of the fucking world. Give him some cocaine. You know what I mean? I feel fine. You're going to feel a lot more fine if Keith would learn to share.
3261.00 3275.20 speaker4  Five o'clock TV hour. You know what? It's probably past my years to do an upper like cocaine. It might stop my heart.
3274.00 3281.48 speaker3  That says to me that you do cocaine.
3278.88 3296.40 speaker4  Oh you want Cialis right now? I'll never not.
3294.48 3309.96 speaker2  and- Randy's got nothing to be ashamed of. Is sideways tint a tint that Merlot's not allowed in?
3304.96 3316.08 speaker3  That scene in fucking sideways tanked the Merlot industry for like a number of years.
3314.08 3328.96 speaker4  I'm fine with all varieties of red wine. Hey did you know that Randy?
3326.64 3336.80 speaker2  Anyway I'm- I think we should also take that oil thing.
3335.72 3352.16 speaker3  You said it was spooky. Another what? A secret place? Or anything?
3350.04 3355.98 speaker2  Yeah what happens when you move that painting?
3353.28 3358.60 speaker4  Why would you want me to move- wait what is happening? Can I sell it?
3356.98 3404.00 speaker2  Why would you ask us if you can sell it? I'm gonna excuse myself. Hey do you want to shoot some of these guns before we leave? Yeah do you want to do that?
3403.00 3415.64 speaker3  And he walks off to the bathroom.
3414.00 3417.22 speaker4  as soon as I get out of the bathroom.
3415.64 3424.30 speaker3  Is anything else fucking weird? Does anything else lead to a gun door or something of that ilk?
3423.30 3428.06 speaker4  You call them trapsies? What do you call them?
3427.06 3434.88 speaker3  Go change your fucking britches. That's just making me mad.
3433.88 3452.02 speaker4  It's not my fault. And he walks away.
3451.02 3468.62 speaker3  Long ones. Short ones. Fat ones. Tall ones. Red ones. Brown ones. Sad ones. I got sniper rifle. Assault rifle. Six pistols and four body armors. Yeah there's a bunch.
3467.62 3469.62 speaker2  Let's let him pick.
3468.62 3489.94 speaker3  Yeah. While they're going through the guns I want to walk over to that painting and run my hand around the edge of it and look for any kind of clicking mechanism. Oh yeah let's move everything that's as conspicuous as a tuxedo statue or a rose oil painting in this house.
3483.22 3521.78 speaker2  Like Clark you walk over to the oil painting of the rose and as you put your fingers behind it you actually feel space right behind the painting. Inside there are multiple kinds of spray bottles as well as different types of gloves and materials. There's also a list and on this list is materials and those materials are inside.
3520.40 3561.06 speaker3  It's got a whole bunch of stuff. some soap, some bleach, some vinegar, some Drano, the works, coca-cola, and oil. It's also got a whole bunch of like cotton and latex and vinyl and plastic and aluminum and neoprene and lead and salt and candy and meat and ammonium nitrate. I don't know about making bombs but... What is neoprene?
3559.10 3586.54 speaker2  Neoprene is just a synthesized rubber. Let me make sure that's correct. Neoprene, also polychloroprene or PC rubber. It's a family of synthetic rubbers that are produced by polymerization of chloroprene. Cool. The more you know. Everything is labeled and there is a pair of neoprene gloves. Is there...
3584.30 3600.90 speaker3  I can't discern why that would be. If we do a Google search for like a number of these ingredients in concert, does a recipe or anything pop up?
3597.06 3602.94 speaker2  It's Calcium Lime and Rust Remover.
3601.90 3622.84 speaker3  It gets rid of that stuff. All listeners of pretending to be people, if you can go down to your local Walgreens, get some CLR, it'll clean your calcium, your lime, your rust. It's going to clean that bathtub up real good. Your sink, I think you can use it on metal too, right? That's the rust part.
3620.44 3641.22 speaker2  Yeah, you got any white spots on your taps? White spots, brown spots, yellow spots, red spots. Your shower head's got some calcium on there, just soak it in there for a minute. Pretending to be people. You're going to have some good water flow here in about two or three minutes.
3639.52 3669.52 speaker3  You dip your shower head in some CLR. That's a dream, man. High power. Yeah, and it's not necessarily something you have to know.
3662.44 3681.32 speaker2  Okay, also, Jon, when you Googled these ingredients, you would find out ammonium nitrate is a common agricultural fertilizer and a deadly explosive agent.
3680.32 3694.72 speaker3  City bombing? That's Keith. I don't know anything about it. It's the one thing you remember.
3693.72 3698.68 speaker2  Which one was it? Timothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City. Yep, that piece of shit.
3696.72 3708.16 speaker3  Do you guys know a brand name called The Works? Yeah, it's used to clean your toilets.
3700.96 3764.28 speaker2  Also if you put The Works and balls of aluminum foil in a water bottle and shake it up, you can make a Works bomb. It's not really a bomb as much as it is. It just explodes and makes a really loud sound. It'll make the grass not grow in that spot for a couple years. I know this from lots of experience in Ozark, Missouri, where you do it and then you're And then people call the cops and you're like, you've wasted resources. My dad showed us how to do that in our backyard. It's very fun. If I wasn't a little drunk right now, I would suggest making one.
3761.60 3781.36 speaker3  Honestly, yeah, I think it's in character. John Lee Pettymore would know right away that you can make bombs.
3773.48 3806.56 speaker2  And as you're bonding, Randy Angst comes caning back into the room holding his underwear aloft. Go throw it away.
3805.56 3821.48 speaker3  Well, that's fine. What's the coolest gun here? he has the highest firearms.
3818.44 3823.48 speaker2  No, but I mean, just like to make up for him, you know, doing what he did. Oh, well, the sniper rifle.
3822.48 3833.48 speaker3  Yeah.
3830.92 3865.02 speaker2  and say, here, let's go shoot this. and his jacket and he's wearing no underwear and no pants, but his socks are showing and Don't be, don't be embarrassed.
3864.02 3878.70 speaker4  you. I can use it to shoot this pee for solid piss I've had in months.
3877.70 3890.98 speaker2  we can leave.
3887.28 3895.98 speaker3  Uh, I want to see if there's anything that isn't immediately evident. Search rolls.
3894.98 3900.28 speaker4  Nice.
3899.28 3918.10 speaker3  Okay, nice. 99.
3917.10 3966.26 speaker2  over the house. John, you were in the kitchen and you actually see there's a faulty square of tiles in the kitchen floor. What kind of tile? They're like eight inch by eight inch and four of them are loose. Okay, so as you peel away these tiles, you would see that there is an empty cubicle space right beneath you that seems to be about a foot by a foot and it looks like something heavy was dragged on the tile from this spot toward the front door. Okay, so you're hollering about that as Clark is standing in the foyer and he's looking at the suit of armor, which has this white hard hat on it.
3964.86 3970.34 speaker3  That's exactly correct.
3966.26 4007.54 speaker2  As soon as you knock on it, I need you to roll dexterity. leads to a pit beneath you and as you're holding on, you look down into the pit and you see two dead bodies. The smell is overwhelming.
4005.66 4013.34 speaker1  I do not pass.
4011.74 4023.34 speaker2  And now it's just me and you, Jon.
4019.58 4032.42 speaker3  but blame Zach.
4028.30 4045.66 speaker2  of you as you go down and you just barely come down a little awkward. One is male, one is female, but they're basically indistinguishable outside of that.
4044.66 4057.98 speaker1  Yes.
4052.58 4065.10 speaker2  I don't see it, but I run over and I see the hole in the ground and look down and I see him.
4062.54 4070.98 speaker1  I'm going to, I'm going to go through the pockets. Can you guys start looking at it?
4069.10 4123.54 speaker2  This shit smells worse than Randy. Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John, who is lowering down one pant leg of Randy Ang's shit spoiled slacks. Just then a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the house begin shattering. You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon. The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house. How am I the only one trying to fool?
