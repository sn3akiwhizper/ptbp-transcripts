257.50 267.70 speaker1  Everyone from season one is dead to this podcast, Luke.
266.54 273.94 speaker3  What's season one?
271.22 281.02 speaker1  Welcome back to season two of Pretending to be People.
276.78 311.50 speaker3  But honestly, that shit is over and done. And this is a new era of excellence and groundbreaking podcast roleplay. Straight up, dude. Stop. Yeah, you need to stop. The britches this, oh, I feel like I'm, am I clipping for you guys? A little bit. I feel very loud.
310.50 315.98 speaker2  I'll turn you down. I'll just talk louder.
313.94 317.02 speaker3  Oh, the cat's going in the pod box.
315.98 333.74 speaker2  Cat in the pod box.
328.94 382.50 speaker3  Exactly, but after listening to that, huge differences. The britches are going to be small this year, this years. They were big last time and now they're small. No. You lost cat privilege. Okay, so obviously I know the answer to this, but Joe, where exactly did we leave off last time?
375.94 398.14 speaker2  A girl killed another girl in an apartment and it was messed up and we were all kind of exasperated by it. It's a reference to what, Zach?
396.06 412.10 speaker3  Oh, it's a reference to what, Thomas? I don't remember exactly, but isn't it a newsman's bar? I believe it's a bar specifically for newsman's. That's right. I remember the whole thing. I knew the whole time I knew that. So vroom, vroom?
411.22 420.94 speaker2  Vroom, vroom.
414.62 424.66 speaker3  Julius Summers pulls into the parking lot of the foundry.
422.70 432.50 speaker2  What kind of bar is this?
429.66 447.70 speaker3  all over the walls of local news people. And it's kind of maybe equidistant downtown from the three different local news stations. And so they all come and relax and unwind there and talk shop afterwards.
444.34 454.14 speaker2  Are there any TVs on the walls at all? Are they showing the news at this place or is it specifically to unwind away from that?
453.14 478.22 speaker3  I think they are. He just said there are three. I think the foundry is like in an older building downtown, but just absolutely like always in the shadow of these skyscrapers.
477.22 510.14 speaker2  I love it. So pretty much every time this foundry is like rumbling with the train that is basically right outside its back door.
507.82 521.04 speaker3  the conversation like anybody else is having. You have to lean in close. It's a great place to like protect your sources.
515.42 524.54 speaker2  In your mind, is this place filled with producers and talent or is my ilk of the camera man
522.54 529.98 speaker3  Everyone comes to the foundry. We're all friends at the foundry.
525.90 533.54 speaker2  Color 10, KY3, any of the other ones?
529.98 548.50 speaker3  I don't think we're like referencing specific networks, but it would definitely be like the local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, like local anchor people all hanging out there except
546.42 549.98 speaker2  ETC is there.
548.50 555.86 speaker3  ETC, which is...
554.86 572.02 speaker2  Television. Television channel. Channel. Joe, you do one.
571.02 595.70 speaker3  Barbeque. Yeah, Royal Broadcasting. Quarterly. I screech into the parking lot of the foundry.
593.70 649.94 speaker2  Unless Julius goes... doing it, he goes... the high rise that you were just at. I bet you we pull in a little somber. He would not bring his camera in here. I think that this is a sacred place that he knows not to film and that's a very out of character for him. So you guys walk across...
648.94 667.06 speaker3  Also smoking?
661.86 707.50 speaker2  The humidity kind of dies off into the night and you've got kind of a cool summer evening as you guys walk across this gravel parking lot and head around back to the entrance of the foundry on the train track side. A train is currently finishing up. It's bustling through this back area and you see a server is haphazardly making their way through the smokers outside with train shots.
706.50 711.90 speaker3  Nice.
707.50 722.78 speaker2  Which train shots are specifically a special here at the foundry.
721.78 730.46 speaker3  by.
729.46 758.82 speaker2  Brown derby select. It's old granddad. It's old granddad. Oh yeah. Orange bottle.
756.68 765.34 speaker3  out for Cal and Julius.
764.34 781.78 speaker2  train shots. I'll be right back. Probably like we recognize.
779.88 783.52 speaker3  Are they just like local news crew?
781.78 802.20 speaker2  Yeah, it's just another local news crew. They hold up their shots to you as they all wait on the other two shots to come, which come quickly and you're all able to.
801.20 818.78 speaker3  Very excited. Like he gives a very knowing look to Beck. I think you know what that means, Becca.
814.96 849.72 speaker2  We exchange a look and you see a big smile on Beck looking at you. It's going to be good for you.
843.56 875.50 speaker3  I mean, I don't know that I'll forget about that anytime soon, but no, the images will
874.50 901.14 speaker2  Probably yeah. I think that'd be cool. Do you go sneak in right before Beck gets there?
896.22 903.70 speaker3  Leading the way, I'm just going and sitting down and turning around like, look what I
902.14 956.58 speaker2  Hey, that's the one we always sit at. That's weird, dude. Cool. Hanging Wes Anderson style directly center frame of the booth is an old picture of Cal from the night after his first television broadcast as a head news anchor, and it's beautifully framed in this old oak wooden frame and is sitting gloriously. He looks like a kid. The suit's wearing him.
955.58 996.22 speaker3  or anything. He just doesn't want to catch sight of it. Sure, sure, sure. He's wanted to do this for so long. Just be a producer and be part of the news and be able to get into this place. He is so fucking stoked. Julius, if you wiggle like that during the printing press, you could lose a finger. Printing press. I want to find out what it is. Your research didn't tell you what it is.
991.82 1000.98 speaker2  I don't think that anybody goes out there just telling other people about it, you know?
999.18 1022.42 speaker3  Only kidding. It's a process that happens in three steps. Julius pulls his shirt up as he lays on the table and then realizes what was said and then he goes and sits back down again.
1019.68 1035.62 speaker2  Tell him the second part. This is kind of like your last moment of choice here, but you get to decide what liquor you want.
1034.62 1062.54 speaker1  Tequila.
1060.18 1121.34 speaker2  Same, by the way.
1119.34 1133.46 speaker3  a very pale man. He's pretty pale.
1123.34 1154.78 speaker2  You see a trunk of a woman in a denim vest with long, a long braid down the back of her
1149.54 1184.70 speaker1  We got a newbie over at city action news.
1183.02 1229.66 speaker3  Jonah from Veep.
1228.66 1257.42 speaker1  Let's go check that out.
1251.86 1350.78 speaker2  talked about who his character would interact with the most. And when you said mom immediately, I thought, well, let's get our podcast, uh, dad to come on and play Beck Wilder's mom. And like, this isn't the first time I've been called a mother, but at least the circumstances pretending to be people for the first time for some fucking reason. Scott is my parasocial RPG mentor. Matt Sanderson and Paul Fricker, good friends of Jackson Elias truly developed me into the GM that I am today. And I am super appreciative of all the lessons I've learned listening to their podcast over the years. Oh, blimey.
1346.38 1356.82 speaker1  and you answered some questions for him one time and he was so excited and told us all about it.
1355.82 1405.72 speaker2  No, yeah. We weren't even talking about recording a podcast, but I was running Helen Texas, which is a scenario that you wrote for the book, The Things We Leave Behind by Stygian Fox Publishing. Well that time sink made this nerd super happy and validated many, many years ago. So thank you for that.
1402.64 1450.44 speaker1  Some might say this podcast wouldn't exist without you, Scott. You gave him the hope, the drive.
1448.04 1458.32 speaker2  rad. Quite noisy.
1453.32 1493.68 speaker1  I'm going to move it into the back room. I barely get through a recording session without one of my cats running into the room and screaming like a seagull or jumping all over things and knocking shit over. My cats are named Chaos and Anarchy, and it's with good reason.
1491.44 1517.28 speaker2  segment out on a farm. He had a rough evening. Was it evening? Yeah, it was a rough evening. You were called out for a potential story that was...
1510.32 1564.64 speaker1  It was a terrible, terrible crime scene, including a partially severed head. That wasn't what Beck was thinking was going to happen that day. Yeah, I mean, a severed head is bad enough. Beck isn't in the greatest headspace. He's now just gotten back from the foundry, where he had a nice night trying to drink his troubles away. Are you feeling a little loose? He's maybe a little bit looser than normal, but he kind of lives in an equilibrium of inebriation.
1560.36 1576.64 speaker2  So as you arrive home, it's late at night. It's 1130 PM, maybe even midnight, which is about as late in the night as you can get.
1573.64 1580.92 speaker1  That's right.
1576.76 1614.88 speaker2  Kim Wilder has the home to herself.
1608.32 1626.48 speaker1  The sound is way down on the TV, and there's just the clack, clack, clack of knitting needles.
1620.96 1678.88 speaker2  Out of the corner of her eyes, she just keeps darting her eyes over and stabbing them into the corner where Beck keeps his camera equipment, which is not there at the time, but there's like a whole corner of this room that is specifically set up to house Beck's livelihood. Oh yeah. And the last you saw Beck, it was maybe even yesterday because today you knew that he was in his bedroom. You knew that he had been sleeping in, but you went to knock on his door for tea or snack And as those thoughts are flowing through your brain, the front door swings open.
1676.44 1722.20 speaker1  Oh, this is awkward. again. And where have you been tonight, young man?
1716.00 1739.76 speaker4  There's still some hot dog casserole in the oven, it's probably, oh, it's probably burnt to a crisp by now, but well, give it a try.
1735.52 1778.32 speaker1  Beck starts walking toward the fridge and you can tell now that he's a little drunker even than you've ever seen him. He's a stumble-ier than you've ever seen him. tonight Mom, it was bad.
1777.00 1827.26 speaker4  You're out all hours. I never know whether I'm going to find you sleeping in your room in the middle of the afternoon or whether you're going to stay out until three o'clock in the morning. Clearly what you're doing isn't making you enough money for you to actually move into your own place. And now you're saying that it's dangerous as well, and it's going to get you into trouble. Why do you do this? Why can't you just get a proper job? You know, Macy Grindel's son, Deke, he's got, he's got a nice thriving business for himself selling secondhand sofa beds and he's moved into a new apartment downtown. It's all his own. Well, I think he's got a couple of flatmates, but he's not living with his mother anymore. That's the important thing.
1823.58 1879.10 speaker1  Oh, not this again. Jesus Christ. Brilliant. along with these words. Playing the greatest hits. If you love Deke so much, why didn't you give birth to him?
1878.06 1903.50 speaker4  Ew, gross mom.
1900.78 1920.30 speaker2  And then Beck's like, go fuck my friend's dad.
1918.54 1948.86 speaker1  to like avoid eye contact with you. what I want to do. Like, I don't know if you can understand like happiness from that perspective, but that's what I've got for me right now.
1941.74 1986.22 speaker4  things that we don't want to do, because that's just how we get through life. And yes, all right, you can run around doing your camera stuff and whatever it is you do at three o'clock in the morning. And I try not to judge you, but sooner or later, you've got to grow up. You can't just carry on like this and pretend that everything's all right. You've got to you've got to grow up someday, boy.
1982.54 1993.90 speaker1  And he pulls the food out of the microwave and he's holding the plate and he's kind of picking at it with a fork.
1991.34 2011.58 speaker5  We disagree on like fundamental things, Ma. I just maybe someday you'll see that I can do this and also like be successful, whatever that means to you. I'm going to my room. All right.
2008.38 2023.66 speaker4  I've left them out for you, but you'll have to make the bed yourself. And I tried to get the stains out, but we're going to have to try a new brand.
2023.26 2049.58 speaker5  Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Mommy. You got any milk?
2047.98 2050.30 speaker2  I think that's the end of the night.
2049.58 2060.06 speaker1  That was perfect.
2059.26 2067.58 speaker2  Oh, thank you.
2066.94 2095.42 speaker1  Got any milk? That is going to haunt me. Scott, thank you so much.
2089.82 2132.78 speaker2  He runs two different full scenarios for us on pretending to be people in our bonus episodes Scott, you ran Bleak Prospect, a Call of Cthulhu scenario that you wrote so fucking creepy. Yeah. And you also recently ran a Pulp Cthulhu scenario, both of which, by the way, that Scott wrote. This one was A New Age of Wonders. And that was, for me personally, I think one of my absolute favorite player experiences I've ever had in an RPG. Oh, man.
2131.50 2146.06 speaker1  Oh, I'm glad you liked it. I had an absolute blast running it. All right.
2145.18 2203.82 speaker2  Oh, marvelous. Look forward to it. Welcome back to Pretending to Be People. We are here with a special guest right now. It is the GM of the Lost Mountain Saga, one of the best players from Glass Canada Network's Androids and Aliens. It is Eleanor de Lorenzo. Hello. I understood.
2203.02 2210.70 speaker3  I understood that.
2209.02 2251.42 speaker2  Thank you so much for coming back on. Thank you for inviting me. If you're listening to this and you haven't heard Ellie on Pretending to Be People before, Bigfoot Underground Search and Hunt for her and some other guest players. And we had an absolutely phenomenal time. You were such a wonderful player that I was so excited to bring you back on. Another huge reason that I was so excited to bring you on is when I told Thomas, I was like, Hey, dude, Ellie from A&A is coming on Pretending to Be People.
2248.06 2263.26 speaker3  And then you had her play with a bunch of people who weren't fans of that show,
2262.62 2268.96 speaker2  to Be People. Fair enough.
2268.46 2293.50 speaker3  Yes. Now I played with very talented, wonderful women and they were all great. They were hot.
2290.46 2294.70 speaker5  And one of them was apparently married to you, Zach.
2294.30 2309.44 speaker2  Yeah. Apparently. Yeah. Allegedly married. I'm an allegedly lucky man.
2308.94 2317.66 speaker1  Okay.
2316.94 2322.22 speaker2  Coming in hot.
2321.82 2332.46 speaker3  Wow. I'd watch that. No, I'm not married.
2329.74 2373.02 speaker5  No, it was like, it was like a gut reaction. No. Right. And you're like, not that I'm aware of. It's like, do you have a wife? And I just realized that I know you guys are from a state, but I don't remember which state right this second. Is it Missouri? It is.
2371.42 2382.22 speaker3  You fucking nailed it. We love it.
2381.34 2395.10 speaker2  It's really hot right now.
2393.58 2402.94 speaker3  Yeah, you can be on a horse ranch.
2402.86 2412.62 speaker2  in.
2411.74 2414.86 speaker5  But that's true.
2412.62 2416.62 speaker2  That's a really cool thing about Missouri.
2414.86 2432.38 speaker5  You have an actual kitchen. I love that. I want a Missouri kitchen.
2426.94 2464.78 speaker2  I want to dive back into some of the things that you've seen here on this random night. you're leaving the foundry is just this headless, almost headless neck held on by a couple of
2459.74 2476.70 speaker3  Mostly my mind is just shouting neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as I see like this horrifying like red flash and this image of this nearly headless neck.
2472.30 2490.16 speaker2  Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you drive really far back to your home. Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole, neck hole everywhere. Neck hole, neck hole, neck hole as you sit into your chair.
2489.66 2519.82 speaker3  Natch. it on all day. He grabs a glass and takes a bottle of cheap white wine out of the refrigerator and pours
2518.70 2528.46 speaker2  of a text or a call. Do you not have a phone that vibrates?
2525.50 2529.02 speaker3  We have a ring on this podcast.
2528.46 2549.26 speaker2  That's right. Ring, ring, ring, ring. What is Carol's face look like on the screen of Cal's phone here?
2545.10 2567.02 speaker5  She currently looks a little flushed as if she might have been, I don't know, working out or something. sitting down on a couch that you recognize to be her student room. Hey.
2566.54 2580.22 speaker3  I'm sorry. I've had kind of an extraordinary evening. Honey, how are you?
2577.18 2620.78 speaker5  I can't see you like you're filming your forehead again. No, please. You remember, like, you can put it a little bit further away from your face. Then that works better. It's all right. And she puts down the phone and it's just voiceover.
2619.34 2628.54 speaker3  It's a Saturday night. I'm a single man. Can I not enjoy a sifter of wine?
2626.22 2638.14 speaker5  Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you a little bit about. I wondered if you have you been doing anything fun lately? Like, except working.
2636.38 2639.50 speaker3  Your mother and I always tried to tell you that.
2639.10 2655.18 speaker5  I know. I just, I don't know. I worry about you. That's why I just wish you, you know, would get out there a little bit.
2651.50 2667.18 speaker3  And he kind of gulps and he's like, I get out, sweetie. Just today, I saw some corn wrestling while I was out on assignment. They also had crabs, not the men, the farm. They raised corn and crabs.
2666.38 2682.54 speaker5  So I get out. I know. I just, I don't know if you, I'm sure you already heard, but mom, I think mom's seeing someone.
2680.62 2706.96 speaker3  He's quite a bit younger too. I heard he was 40.
2705.68 2733.84 speaker5  It's yeah, I don't know. Well, promise you won't get angry. that's why I went to journalism school.
2729.04 2740.16 speaker3  family business, which is your ultimate dream and desire, of course, right?
2734.56 2765.36 speaker5  But well, I've decided and she suddenly gets like defensive as if she's ready to fight. I've decided that I'm not going to do that anymore. I've decided that I am going to pursue something else, something that I am passionate about and it's not journalism. It's not writing. It's not any of that. I have decided I'm going to become a nature photographer.
2764.96 2808.72 speaker3  Really? Sweetheart, I just want you to know that no matter what you choose, even if you're not a world class news anchor like me or a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist like your mother, That's what it's all about.
2805.28 2836.72 speaker5  So now I'm going to tell you the real my real job. It's not it's not pornography.
2835.60 2842.88 speaker3  Nerd pornography.
2841.84 2867.04 speaker5  You never understand. You mock everything I do. That's the problem with you and mom. You're both academics. And I don't want to be involved with this. Like, I don't want to go to school anymore. I'm going to buy my camera. I'm going to take pictures of my friends and and they will pay me eventually. And then I'll start an Instagram account and I'm going to make a lot of money. And there's nothing you can say or do.
2866.08 2877.76 speaker2  This is hold on. This is specifically because of what you've seen tonight. And the amount of grip that you lost. It is going to affect the relationships that you have.
2874.80 2889.12 speaker3  But I was like what I was just about to say was all about that. Oh, okay.
2885.52 2905.36 speaker2  Yeah, he hates the dice, but he succeeds. Okay. Yeah. All fair enough.
2898.72 2932.64 speaker3  little bit, but then he, then he composes itself and he says, honey, your mother and I will support you no matter what you choose to do. We only want you to be happy. If you can make beautiful art and put it into this world, that is enough for me. You're going to want to approach this more carefully with your mother.
2931.76 2937.60 speaker5  That's the thing.
2934.00 2948.64 speaker3  Until you burlesque photography.
2946.96 2952.00 speaker5  You said you've seen some horrible stuff.
2951.52 2964.32 speaker3  Sorry. It bent the wrong way. It was gnarly.
2964.00 2975.44 speaker5  All right. Is he going to be okay? Yes, sweetie.
2973.36 2984.16 speaker3  will be an important contributing part of it.
2981.68 3007.20 speaker5  Like, wow, he really needs to start getting out there. there are apps you can download that would like match you with other women. I just don't want you to be like, be alone.
3004.32 3028.16 speaker3  I have you, I have my memories. He points to all the pictures around the house. What are these women apps you told me about?
3025.20 3090.40 speaker5  I mean, like when you've downloaded them, let me know and I'll give you some advice because you can't be like, like, don't start commenting on women's profiles like a weirdo. and then you write something nice about you. Like you're an established journalist and then you wait for women to contact you. I don't know, man. So dad, you can't follow my friends. Like, they are not part of the dating pool.
3089.52 3095.92 speaker3  Have you heard of this? Have you heard of TikTok?
3095.20 3099.12 speaker5  Oh, I'm sorry.
3096.64 3117.52 speaker3  Well, I learned about it today and I did a dance. It's posted on the can TikTok for the station. People liked it.
