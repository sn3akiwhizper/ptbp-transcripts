0.00 17.68 speaker0  Good morning, y'all. How are y'all doing out there? It is December 4th here in contention, and it's been a jam-packed week here, so I think it's good to remind y'all what time it is every now and then.
14.76 22.18 speaker1  to read on the air again against my will.
21.36 56.12 speaker0  Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ow. Ow. Ow.
54.52 192.58 speaker1  Are you provides? Ha ha. know the drill to all other species, I apologize for that small outburst. Now for some mole shit, it's the news. Officer Bishop learned that the chief's car had been at the mill on the other side of the city since the night of December 1st. The county coroner reports that during the investigation of an active crime scene, Officer John Lee Pettymore of contention slipped and shoved a possible murder weapon into the eye socket of the deceased Maggie Cook, fumbling and digging around atrociously as the charred bones themselves began Also, anyone out there having some fucked up dreams? but it wasn't like my basement, but it was. When I looked down, my spoon was made of wet tuna Then I saw my dog, Wolf, and he had my face on his face. What the fuck is up with that shit? Well, you know what they say. Now I'm gonna need y'all to wave your hands in the air like you just don't care, because in contention, nihilism reigns supreme and the points don't matter. It's kudzu with no backbone. Real quick, roll a constitution check for me. Pass.
191.76 204.08 speaker0  Fail. Okay, so John, you will get one hit point back
201.86 207.30 speaker2  I was gonna say two D6 would be great.
205.58 219.10 speaker0  I rolled a three, I get three back. Good work, Clark.
218.26 224.62 speaker2  What are you at?
222.86 234.22 speaker0  My willpower is at two.
231.74 303.14 speaker2  You guys put a lot into con. It's Keith Vigna. I'm having a real off day today. I text him, I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about and I put the Shrug Guy emoji in there. I send back all caps, I don't know what you're talking about, angry face. Okay, I drive to John's house then. What's the timeline? Does he come to my house or? Keith, do you leave early enough to like? Yeah, I do. I get up and I put my clothes on I just woke up mad.
300.86 307.24 speaker0  to see if John is still there. He's not.
305.06 320.20 speaker2  I'm gonna break into his house though. It. I'm desperate. That's not gonna.
317.62 324.72 speaker0  You're gonna break into your coworker's house
322.20 328.40 speaker2  Yeah, because that's my only option right now. He told me that that's.
326.20 331.24 speaker0  I did not say that cocaine was your only option.
328.40 367.32 speaker2  Yeah, but you said coffee wouldn't work, so I assumed. Just jump all the way to cocaine. we have here. I thought this was gonna be a quick one and done. Yep. Okay. Definitely break in if you wanna like really upset John later. Yeah, I mean, I'm already upset. So yeah, I'm fighting mad. So I.
365.96 381.48 speaker0  It's the first time we've seen it. Poopy trap till I get it home alone. It's a nice little property north of town.
379.60 432.88 speaker2  of secluded gravel driveway and you come into this little clearing and there's a nice fucking, you know, older but single story smallish home. There are some, like there's a random truck and a trailer around, you know. And it really looks just peaceful and beautiful and there's like rabbits and deers jumping around and shit and you're about to, you know, disturb that harmony, so. So I pull up and I have lock picking so I'm gonna try to do that first. Is that cool? At his front door? Yes. 26 on a 30, which I have 50, so. Sounds good.
431.00 459.20 speaker0  get up there and start work. Just sweating. Yeah, just work your way into the house. John, what does he find?
458.04 498.98 speaker2  Ooh, doggy. And almost tips over like the Dukes of Hazzard DVDs right next to him. Oh wait, hold up, Smokey and the Bandit is not a TV show, it's a movie. You had a bunch of copies of it. Yeah, so every director's cut, yeah. And anything remotely related to the Smokeyverse. Okay, well, I'm not leaving until I get what I need, so I'll just go from room to room, searching violently through everything till I find it. Okay, is that how a crit fail search role works? Yeah.
495.12 513.12 speaker0  You violently turn over the house of John Lee Pettymore, unable to find the cocaine that you know is on the premises somewhere. Wow, so this is what you want,
508.80 545.52 speaker2  I mean, I'd be, I'm already pretty useless as a cop, I literally could not do our job today without this. So I don't find anything? Nope. I text him one more time, I'm like, dude, tell me where it is. I've got, I brought some stuff for you, it's at the station. but then I just go, I give up and go to my car,
544.68 549.92 speaker0  Okay.
548.92 559.76 speaker2  You didn't? No, but I had to. I don't know if you know what those words mean.
557.68 567.34 speaker0  at the police station, rearing to go on the morning of December 4th, you arrive at 9 a.m.
564.76 572.36 speaker2  I sit at my desk and just put my head down.
568.40 643.62 speaker0  Okay, you know that the FBI will be here in an hour to meet with you, and as you are milling about the office, as the day is beginning, you hear a news story come over Drew's speakers at his desk, and you hear the news story say, 46 more are in critical condition. The fire started early this morning, and the building has just now been cleared after hours of fighting back the fire and sweeping the premises for survivors after the evacuation. We do not have any word yet on how the fire started, but we will deliver updates as they roll in here to the studio. Hold your loved ones close today as we send thoughts and prayers to those who lost friends and family. Stick around for our next segment, experts say we're all showering too much. With your morning update, I'm Yolanda Squat Pump. And immediately following, Drew turns it down to let you guys know that two children were reported missing late last night from a home in the suburbs. Their names are Aiden and Alice Little. Repeat those names, Drew.
641.68 647.64 speaker2  Okay, we'll get right on that.
646.02 651.94 speaker0  I can only imagine. I can only imagine.
650.92 656.34 speaker2  I missed the first part. The hospital. Oh yeah. The city hospital.
654.62 668.06 speaker0  All right, what do you guys wanna do around the office? I don't know. I bet we have a lot of paperwork to do. Is there anything that you want to- Good thing the chief's not here.
666.78 672.46 speaker2  Oh, the chief's dead. We should- Yeah.
670.72 678.98 speaker0  I didn't even, it's a new face. Good thing the chief's not here.
678.14 709.14 speaker2  Hey, John. Yeah, Vigna. not to be texting about that shit on the open lines. I just- and I'm not touching that.
708.30 724.10 speaker3  Okay. I'll get right on it.
722.20 730.44 speaker0  All right, it is 9 a.m. currently, and you are gonna- So for the next 45 minutes, he'll have three.
729.10 759.26 speaker2  For three hours, is that right? Have the makers of this game ever done cocaine? That's how it works. Dictates the hype. I happily go clean the shit out of the cell.
757.38 764.86 speaker0  that she shares with her-
763.34 780.08 speaker2  How long can we keep her here? We looked it up at the time. And you know what, everything's in disarray. Our chief is dead. Oh, you know- Our chief is dead. And-
779.24 790.58 speaker3  We got the FBI coming. Is that what you're getting at when they shouldn't have a Catboy in there? No, if anything, I think that helps us.
788.18 799.84 speaker2  I'm just thinking further on down the road when she brings a civil rights lawsuit against us. Sure.
797.06 813.00 speaker3  I think we're still within our rights for today. Oh, that's what we'll tell the FBI.
809.90 821.34 speaker2  and I said, I would even eat off this floor, but I'm not hungry. And then I come back up to John, I'm like, can I please have that?
819.98 824.10 speaker0  Yeah, I give him the baggie.
821.34 829.38 speaker2  I stick it in my pocket and then I'm ready to talk to these feds.
826.14 841.30 speaker3  Fellas, we should maybe talk about our story here. Do we want to tell them everything? Tell them nothing?
839.34 862.62 speaker2  you guys want me to pick you up some breakfast or something? Have you guys eaten yet? Oh yeah. I go grab some food for us, get back like right as they're getting here and then act like, hey, I got our breakfast. Also, anybody recognize this? I don't know where it came from. I found it in the trunk of my car. That's the plan. I like it. And then I'll somehow remember that it's from John's house.
860.06 879.02 speaker3  So when they were talking to me last night, they seem to know a lot about a lot of stuff. So if they start asking us about stuff, are we gonna lie to them or? I'm playing dumb. we're already giving them the one thing they wanted.
878.18 892.10 speaker2  let's read them. Exactly. Is that a skill? I got 80 humant, so. And now I'm not at a negative 20. So hell yeah.
891.26 897.56 speaker0  Yeah.
895.54 934.38 speaker2  Also, John. What about? In which I profusely apologize for what I did this morning. I don't wanna worry you. Okay, yeah. Well, that makes me feel better. I just wanted to. Yeah, it's. discipline when texting about drugs. Like, absolutely heard from now on. Yeah. What do you guys want for breakfast?
933.02 939.90 speaker3  did we make a breakfast place? Beans on Beans. Yeah, let's go to Beans on Beans.
938.90 965.00 speaker2  Mm-hmm. The Big Bean special? You want the Big Bean Sonic burrito that they import from the City Sonic? I mean, Sonic's right around the corner. If you could just stop at Sonic. I'll swing by there. That'd be great. That'll kill me some time. Do you want, what kinda, you want black or pinto?
964.16 966.66 speaker3  Black eyed. Black eyed?
965.82 968.32 speaker2  Yeah.
967.50 972.58 speaker3  Extra bacon. I know you. One piece soggy and one piece crispy. Okay, I can do that.
971.74 977.46 speaker2  Just tell them it's Clark's.
973.40 979.96 speaker3  Oh, the Beans, Bishop's Beans breakfast. That's it. Gotcha.
979.12 982.18 speaker2  Bishop's Beans breakfast.
980.92 993.22 speaker3  to the menu at some point. I think it might be. Okay, cool.
990.34 1000.90 speaker2  but I find it disgusting that you let them dangle one strip of bacon in the bean water and leave the other strip.
999.84 1003.98 speaker3  It's so good, buddy.
1002.74 1015.10 speaker2  Screw it, make it two. Two, okay, well. I'll try it. I'll be back in about, let me know when they get here, and then I'll be back then.
1013.58 1022.70 speaker3  When you see their car pull in.
1021.10 1026.90 speaker0  Beans on Beans?
1025.46 1039.86 speaker2  You don't associate the two? I do, but it makes me kinda sick of my stomach the more I think about it, so I don't wanna think about it. Fair enough. Why?
1035.40 1048.32 speaker0  Keith's actual last name is Beans.
1046.04 1062.68 speaker2  I changed my name to avoid embarrassment but kinda picked a dumb name. I mean, Beans is a dumb name, but.
1061.84 1065.84 speaker3  I can't remember. Yeah, it might have been out of character.
1065.00 1068.30 speaker2  His dog's name is Beans.
1066.92 1076.26 speaker0  Yeah.
1074.64 1092.02 speaker2  Before I was Keith Vigna. Okay, so I go to my namesake street and breakfast joint.
1090.44 1111.44 speaker0  waiting for the FBI. Yeah, I actually, I need to talk to Drew for a minute.
1107.84 1134.80 speaker2  Hey, so what time did Clark come by the station last night? with the people next door, right? Yes. Well, see, that's pretty strange, Drew, because I was with Clark at 1 a.m. Did you notice anything, besides the limp, did you notice anything funny about him?
1132.84 1153.84 speaker0  like he'd been through some shit. His uniform and everything seemed right. Well, he wasn't wearing his uniform. He had just come in earlier to change into civilian clothes. I guess he changed again into some other civilian clothes, but yeah, no, he looked kind of messed up, but he was wearing normal clothes.
1151.64 1179.48 speaker2  And he warned you not to go to the Chief's house, and this was before or after you were contacted by the reporter? This was before. So from now on? Yeah. If you see one of us without any of the other of us, that makes any sense? If I see any of you individually. Yeah.
1176.32 1186.98 speaker0  Just keep an eye out, because maybe it's not us. What, what do you mean?
1184.22 1194.56 speaker2  but you know how we got that cat man in there?
1193.40 1203.34 speaker0  What? I mean, I get it that he wants to be a cat, and he thinks he's a cat and stuff, but like-
1201.40 1216.88 speaker2  Maybe this is a bigger conversation. Honestly, I'd like, yeah. Once Clark gets out of the bathroom, I think he should know about this too, but I just wanted to go over it real quick.
1214.28 1226.24 speaker0  you guys moved all the cocaine?
1224.64 1232.44 speaker2  Okay, yeah, good thinking.
1230.36 1235.66 speaker0  That's even better than it being here.
1232.44 1315.06 speaker2  Yeah, oh, yeah, it's buried in a secure vault. Perfect. Okay. Hey, that cake is safe, buddy. Oh, Vigna was texting me for some coke because he knew it was at my house. He's very tired and an idiot. He is certainly that. why don't you call it cake or just anything besides coke if we're texting? in a court of law, you know, if they were viewing those texts. Like, I think that's kind of one-to-one, so we might wanna circle back and think of some. But for right now... Man, this is a lot. Honestly, I am in this. I'm like, let's make some money, but goddamn, this is a lot on top of all this goo monster nonsense and the chief dyin' and all the other things we haven't followed up on. I'm gonna miss her.
1310.90 1318.82 speaker0  and Drew and John Lee Pettymore are at Drew's desk talking.
1317.50 1336.30 speaker2  Yeah, what's up? Hey, so I got a text from Drew this morning. It seems while you and I were at the donut shop, another you was at the station talking to Drew here. What do you mean another me?
1334.98 1349.94 speaker3  Another you.
1345.38 1368.14 speaker0  You came to the station last night at 1 a.m. and you told me not to go to the chief's house. And you were limpin'. I'm really sorry that I went. Now, I wish I would've listened to you,
1366.06 1374.10 speaker3  I mean, you must've been confused.
1373.02 1380.42 speaker2  He said he was you.
1378.38 1383.62 speaker3  That was one o'clock, wasn't it, wasn't it, John? Oh, yeah. We were there.
1381.26 1391.82 speaker2  I was with, that's why I brought you in. That's why I'm telling him, Drew, because I was with the man. It wasn't me.
1390.98 1399.30 speaker0  All right. Nah, I don't... Should we roll it?
1396.82 1402.58 speaker2  He's dead. Drew explodes.
1401.38 1405.70 speaker0  No. I can see it.
1404.54 1409.06 speaker3  It's like Kenneth from 30 Rock. Yeah, exactly.
1408.22 1411.42 speaker0  Wow.
1410.10 1416.10 speaker2  My boy's sane as hell. Don't be telling him that he's not seeing what he sees.
1414.78 1422.02 speaker3  Yeah, for the sake of the argument, what else do I say?
1419.50 1425.14 speaker0  you were acting really weird, and you... Acting weird how?
1424.02 1430.22 speaker3  Was I falling over?
1427.94 1486.66 speaker0  and you were wearing different clothes than you were when you left with your CVs on, and you were wearing normal clothes, but you came in, you were limping, you looked really haggard, and you'd been through some stuff, and you exasperatedly told me not to go to the chief's house, and I asked you why, and then you were mumbling something, and you walked away, and you just left. And I was busy here, so I didn't worry about it. I figured I wouldn't go to the chief's house. I didn't understand why you didn't want me to go there, but later when Mr. Dorsey came by, when Harold stopped by and he wanted to go there, he wasn't gonna take no for an answer, and so I... I went with him, I wanted to let him, I didn't wanna just give him the chief's keys, but he wasn't gonna leave, and I was just trying to be nice.
1485.74 1496.22 speaker2  Drew, you did good.
1495.06 1510.86 speaker3  How about we check the tapes? Can I see myself walking in, maybe?
1508.46 1566.84 speaker0  and as you are watching them, you see a figure limping, wearing a hoodie and jeans, limping their way into the police station just from around the corner on foot, then not even a minute later, the same figure leaves around the same corner on foot. walk in to limp into the police station, wearing the same clothes you saw the figure wearing outside, say something to Drew, Drew doesn't get up from his desk, and then Clark leaves. If you could both roll me a sanity check.
1564.22 1572.14 speaker3  I crit pass with an 11. Okay, that is not you.
1569.98 1596.14 speaker0  Not a chance that that's you. Fail. I don't know. From my point of view, the reason that I said there's no way that's used normally when we do sanity loss, the losing of a sanity.
1594.66 1601.76 speaker3  it probably didn't seem unnatural to me.
1597.98 1614.10 speaker0  you would deny its existence as being unnatural, whereas you are wholly convinced that that is Clark Bishop and you lose a D4 of sanity. What do you think about, I mean. That's in line with how we've been playing.
1611.04 1628.68 speaker3  and told me that the body was older on the inside than it was on the outside, and I crit passed a sanity check on that, and so I just chalked it up to bad test results.
1624.28 1635.48 speaker2  you wanna maintain your sanity for game reasons, right? And then.
1632.24 1660.44 speaker0  And understand more by passing rules, but I actually like the discord between the two, where not losing the sanity is good mechanically, but not understanding the truth is also technically good for your character, even though we all know that learning more about the unnatural causes the game to move forward. Does that make sense?
1659.04 1668.64 speaker2  But learning more about the unnatural
1666.12 1691.84 speaker3  You could also say, I know it's not me in a more literal sense that I'm like so, there's some tell that I'm so sure that that's an imposter or something like that. What do you think that would be? You don't own a hoodie? Obviously it's not me, because I ain't limping. Well, I think you're arguing past each other.
1689.72 1699.08 speaker2  I'm not suggesting it is you, Clark, but that's someone with your face.
1697.72 1706.76 speaker3  Are the pants ripped or any blood, anything on them or anything?
1702.94 1727.68 speaker2  but given that this has been three or four days of game time and this has been four months of game play, have we in the past week encountered anybody limping or heard about anybody? Just Keith.
1725.80 1740.86 speaker3  John and Clark slowly look at each other, realization passing between their eyes. It's fucking Keith. It's Keith. He's a shapeshifter.
1739.40 1747.28 speaker0  Guys, I'm really scared.
1743.96 1774.28 speaker3  and I say, Drew, all I can tell you is that that wasn't me, but maybe from here on out, if you are talking to one of us, you might text us also. I told him the same thing. Yeah, that way we can be sure. I'm not at the station, for example, and then you should grab that person in front of you and hold them. Okay.
1770.48 1782.88 speaker2  of one of our cell phones and knows about this arrangement and then orchestrates a double switch. That's unlikely.
1780.96 1787.00 speaker0  No, it's the best plan we have,
1785.44 1796.94 speaker2  asking to look at your phone or anything. What if we handcuffed our phones to our hands? No, that's stupid.
1794.80 1809.40 speaker3  I'm gonna say bubblegum tree.
1807.70 1812.42 speaker2  You just kind of took our things.
1809.40 1818.72 speaker0  Yeah, but I took the two that made it alliteration. I like it.
1817.90 1823.38 speaker2  I'm not gonna remember that.
1818.72 1827.94 speaker0  And yours is lollipop bush and his is bubble tree. Bubblegum tree? We got it, we nailed it. We definitely have this.
1826.14 1829.30 speaker2  What if we all just say bubblegum tree?
1827.94 1832.54 speaker3  Oh, that would make more sense. Okay.
1831.22 1837.88 speaker0  That sounds good. Flash, thunder.
1837.04 1840.02 speaker3  Bubblegum tree.
1838.98 1843.96 speaker0  Yeah, bubblegum tree.
1843.12 1859.98 speaker2  Bubblegum tree. Hey, Drew. of that conversation to Clark?
1858.66 1868.86 speaker0  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'll let him know. It's probably about time for us to get him back here, right? It's 11, 15, or what time is it? It's like?
1868.02 1881.06 speaker3  Did you mean Keith? Yes. Okay. I thought you were saying Drew texts Clark because we don't know if this Clark is the Clark. I was also confused by that.
1880.16 1892.28 speaker2  to the fake Clark?
1890.84 1903.80 speaker3  that maybe one of us came in here and said something to you and then never talked about it ever again? Could this have happened before?
1902.26 1910.48 speaker0  You guys talk about a lot of stuff that you never follow up on again. Fuck off, Drew.
1909.64 1913.96 speaker2  God damn it.
1911.84 1921.48 speaker3  on our prowess in the copping world.
1919.80 1931.24 speaker2  I hand Drew my gun and my badge Walk a mile in these boots.
1928.80 1934.78 speaker0  and he reaches out slowly for your gun.
1933.20 1966.06 speaker2  God damn it, Drew. hey, it's cheaper to get this with an egg. How do you want your egg cooked? I didn't see the, I don't respond to the group text. Okay. I met beans on beans.
1964.88 1973.60 speaker3  that the other Clark was wearing? Is it stuff that I knew that I owned? It is not stuff that you own.
1971.24 1979.70 speaker0  And that is one of the reasons you found it hard to believe that that was you.
1977.90 1987.66 speaker2  and I wait to see the FBI.
1985.38 2005.52 speaker0  The windows are completely blacked out and Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley make their way out of the shotgun and backseat of the SUV. So they got a driver.
2003.40 2015.82 speaker2  and then I wait like 30 seconds get that bag out and bring in my three bags of beans and the black Nike bag.
2014.82 2120.62 speaker0  Okay, sounds good. Son of a bitch. So Clark and Drew and John are all standing around Drew's desk right at the entrance of the police department when Agent Kennedy and Agent McKinley walk in. Clark, you are the only one out of the three of you who has seen these two before. So I'll describe them again. Agent Kennedy is a short, young woman and Agent McKinley is a tall, old, gruff man. She has a bit of a spark in her step, glint in her eye and he has very slow steps and very dead eyes. And they walk into the police department. Agent Kennedy says, Hi, how are you? Agent McKinley scans you and freaks out. This is the tall, old, gruff man. And his eyes get enormous and he looks at Agent Kennedy and he goes, He turns and he dips. He runs straight out of the police department. So Keith Vigna, you will actually see as you're walking in with this stuff, Agent McKinley running out, and slams the door shut.
2117.92 2123.06 speaker2  or would it take that he's some kind of robot?
2122.04 2125.58 speaker0  I just use that word.
2124.74 2153.90 speaker3  He's a robot. Ocular. Ocular. Ocular pat down. Ocular pat down. I'm gonna get the word out sooner when it helps. Optic, but octo, octo, octo. Optical.
2152.02 2158.46 speaker2  I am so sorry about that.
2155.88 2204.14 speaker0  our last mission went very poorly and he's just all over the place these days. So did you? Never mind him. Minnesota, Ireland? No, just Minnesota. It's in the United States of America. I am from up north. This is how we sound up there. I guess you haven't been. I guess not. Oh, he's just had a real rough go of it the past few days. Oh, thank you.
2201.02 2208.30 speaker2  I toss each of them the bag of breakfast.
2206.98 2217.16 speaker3  Agent Kennedy. Agent Kennedy, sorry about that. Agent Kennedy. This here's Keith Vigna. He's an officer here with us.
2213.70 2222.10 speaker2  Agent like Mr. Anderson. I watched that movie the other day.
2220.82 2231.62 speaker3  This is a real live FBI agent. It's a real agent.
2230.22 2235.18 speaker2  I forgot to get you breakfast. Do you want some of mine?
2233.78 2239.54 speaker0  No, I am good on the breakfast.
2237.58 2243.90 speaker2  One soggy, one crispy. That sounds. Some scrambled eggs.
2241.22 2247.56 speaker0  That just sounds deeply unappealing on all levels. That's what I'm saying, lady. Have you tried it though? No one's.
2246.72 2262.46 speaker2  No? I found it in the trunk of my car. I was cleaning all the shit out of my trunk and.
2259.58 2267.18 speaker3  Well heck, this is a, this is a black Nike bag.
2263.66 2277.38 speaker2  I comically slap like hands on both cheeks
2274.14 2291.36 speaker0  She is like clapping her hands together very quickly and jumping up and down and. And she's like, oh my goodness, I've been looking just all over for this. Oh my, you have no idea.
2290.52 2314.82 speaker3  It's empty. Perfect.
2311.66 2323.82 speaker0  and Thomas was vehemently shaking his head no.
2321.06 2324.94 speaker2  Hey now, what did you, what's this bag worth to you?
2323.82 2332.68 speaker3  I go ahead and start pulling it back.
2329.38 2342.22 speaker0  and gets a very serious look in her eye. I don't think you'll want to be doing that. That's all I need.
2340.86 2357.06 speaker3  we're really aiming for here. A little quid pro quo between quid pro quo between fellow officers of the law. Okay, if you're looking for information,
2352.06 2367.10 speaker0  Let me use that bag and then I will give you information. What are you going to do with that bag? I just need to put something in it.
2364.02 2393.54 speaker2  but it gets to the heart of what we're after here. Do you want to put something strange in it? Oh, sorry. I'm pretty hungry. I'm just going to go ahead and, go ahead and start eating on this. I sit down at my desk and start eating my beans while I watch this unfold.
2390.66 2464.66 speaker0  It would be something quite strange. What sort of strange. She reaches into her back pocket and pulls out a small lock box that is two inches by two inches and it has a combination lock on it. what's in here directly into that bag. All right, can you open it up for me officer Bishop? and then holds this lock box right above the bag. And then she opens it and there inside is a small metal sphere about an inch in diameter and she immediately just tilts it and it drops right into the black Nike bag. and breathes the deepest sigh of relief you've seen someone breathe in some time.
2462.76 2476.22 speaker3  With the bag still being held open by me, I pull up to where I can see into it. Do I see the ball at the bottom of the bag? No. That's a heck of a trick lady.
2474.46 2483.68 speaker0  but I'm going to have to take it
2478.86 2497.68 speaker3  Real quick, that little ball, what was that?
2494.60 2538.38 speaker0  Huh, I'm good to finally be rid of it. You see, we have you a bit over the barrel here with all the goings on and I happen to hear that your chief's home blew up last night. Now, we're not sure what kind of a situation that that puts you in here but I'm not sure of a situation that that puts you in here but with all the strange happenings here in contention, I would think that you have far more important things to be worrying about.
2536.10 2560.60 speaker2  eye to eye is that I'm not so sure this ain't both of our problems. Eye with a mouth full of beans, I've.
2558.40 2571.60 speaker3  I was just gonna see if we could keep the bag in case we need it.
2569.44 2610.98 speaker2  I was more than the bag. I was gonna see if we could keep this FBI agent in case we need it, you know what I mean? Holler, just keep your voice down. You're not needed yet. Just shut up in there. It's her cat. as to what that is. That's her husband's body, pissing like a cat all over our goddamn prison walls.
2609.54 2622.70 speaker3  He wouldn't piss in there. The cat is what pissed in the cell. I know what you meant. I was just making sure we remembered what happened. Yeah, yeah.
2621.22 2632.86 speaker2  Signing blame in this scenario. for a while? We could show you around the night life. What she just told us is that she's not.
2632.02 2635.70 speaker0  So we gotta work through it.
2634.86 2641.34 speaker2  balls and beans. You got a mouth?
2639.30 2648.10 speaker3  Just balls and beans.
2646.86 2651.62 speaker2  No, we shouldn't. Keith beans is what we should call you. No, don't call me that.
2650.78 2663.54 speaker3  He does love him so much. Don't call me that. You love beans so much, we're gonna call you
2662.70 2679.02 speaker2  My Lord. My Lord. Yeah, hey, you.
2675.66 2696.02 speaker0  So I was imagining Keith's desk is way back in the bullpen. You guys definitely stuck him in the back of the department. And so he is the closest one back to the cells. So she begins walking across the station and makes it to where you guys are and peeks her head in and looks at the cells.
2694.08 2706.58 speaker2  Hey, you see that man pissing in the corner like a cat?
2701.74 2725.50 speaker0  on all fours, but with one paw just like up on the wall of the cell and he is pissing kind of back behind him and then he starts to kick up his feet onto the like nothing to cover the urine that is on the cell floor.
2723.74 2747.66 speaker2  Hey, hey, Dr. Jacobs. to your husband? What the fuck, lady? All right, no, your husband was turned into a cat by radio.
2744.42 2762.10 speaker0  and they've locked me up in here with no proof that I belong. They did not read me my Miranda rights properly when I was arrested.
2759.42 2775.22 speaker2  I'm almost positive we always do that. So just don't stop your hearsay.
2773.66 2781.66 speaker0  at this whole situation. She looks at you guys.
2779.98 2810.90 speaker2  Obviously anybody would be pissed off about being stuck in a jail cell with their cat husband for however long we've kept her in there. A weird radio and there's a weird gun and there's a weird camera and this shit is frankly scaring the hell out of me and I don't know what's going on and I need you to help.
2808.88 2820.42 speaker3  like that is kind of a relief for me and I'm kind of like nodding earnestly.
2817.62 2880.94 speaker0  Agent Kennedy looks at you all and she says, you guys are in. I'll be right back. and walking back in is Agent Kennedy along with a young bald fit man with sunken intense eyes wearing a black t-shirt and jeans and you would all recognize him as Billy Harrison, the man that was tied up in the back of Charles Donovan's car.
2878.48 2894.92 speaker3  but I am like hand toward the gun. That's a wanted fugitive. Yeah, same.
2890.64 2903.24 speaker0  pressed and folded in a pile in one of his hands with Keith's service revolver sitting on top of it.
2901.40 2929.42 speaker2  and there's black beans just spilled, and I grab my clothes out of his hand and I am red faced with embarrassment and anger and I walk back to my desk.
2926.82 2942.26 speaker0  I sure hope that you're feeling better.
2940.10 2954.26 speaker2  Keith, what the hell did you ask him to do? I just didn't ask him to attack me. That's what he did.
2952.90 2957.62 speaker3  between each person.
2955.34 2981.98 speaker0  This man looks incredulous and he looks over at Agent Kennedy. He's like, I don't know what you're talking about, Officer Vigna, if you wanna keep what happened between you and I private, that's one thing, but don't go spreading rumors about me.
2980.74 2992.54 speaker2  He told us. but he's our friend, kinda, so.
2990.42 3028.94 speaker0  change into his clothes and then handcuff him to a hospital bed and then prance around the room yelling about some Keith beans and he wanted me to smack him in the face repeatedly, but very lightly. It was deeply uncomfortable for me and I. Stop, just stop right there. If it's some Dom sub thing that you're into, that's fine, but I didn't like being dragged into it personally. Yeah, Keith, you gotta keep that.
3027.30 3069.18 speaker2  I don't know who the hell you think you are, but. Hey, buddy, that is, you gotta keep that person alive personally, I just. Let you free. Hey, you know. I just go sit down and eat the rest of my beans, fuming, angry. Hey, okay, so who the hell are you people? What's going on here? Yeah, what'd you mean by we're in?
3067.54 3076.18 speaker0  give him the number and bail. You wanna get home, right? And he's like, I need to get home.
3074.42 3082.26 speaker3  Oh yeah, it's gone.
3080.06 3111.68 speaker2  if you leave right now without telling us what's happened, I will kill you. Hey, hey, Keith. All right, keep your gun on him, but also come over here for a second. I stand exactly where I am, I'm fighting Matt, I'm furious, looking right at him. I'm gonna come over there. I'm gonna whisper here, okay? Like I won't tell Clark, but it is what he's saying, Drew. No. Are you sure? I swear to God. Are you sure, buddy? That's why I wanna shoot him.
3110.86 3115.76 speaker0  I wanna shoot him right now.
3114.04 3132.62 speaker2  anything today that somebody wouldn't get shooting Matt at you for,
3131.52 3136.60 speaker3  Yeah, go ahead and go. Pick it out and evidence. Go get it out of the evidence bags, yeah.
3134.88 3145.74 speaker2  Don't give him his gun back again.
3141.20 3158.30 speaker0  Keith has his gun trained on Billy Harrison, and John is whispering sweet nothings into Keith's ear, and Billy is just standing there looking at you as is Agent Kennedy.
3154.82 3183.38 speaker2  I'm gonna kinda edge my way if I can in front of that gun. I'm doing exaggerated fake yawn, and put my hand up. I don't know who you are, how you know what you know about me or us, but just tell us something before you go.
3182.54 3187.46 speaker3  I'm gonna just.
3186.18 3198.26 speaker2  let's have a little pow wow.
3196.22 3218.66 speaker3  and I'm holding onto the gun, and I'm saying, I'm not gonna let him shoot you, but the sentiment does ring true. We wanna know what's going on around here.
3216.26 3320.08 speaker0  Each and every one of you are completely fucked. Guys, the world does not work in the way that we all grew up knowing it to be, and you are now charged with understanding that. That understanding of the world will cause your life to crumble before your eyes, but the thing that keeps us going is that daily, we are saving the human race from getting wiped out of existence. which is a phone number, and he reaches in his pocket, and he pulls out a card, and it's got a phone number on it, and she says, now you give them a call if things get completely out of hand, or they will call in 48 hours if you don't. I hate to do it like this, but this is your problem now. I'm gonna leave this bag here with you. or what it is capable of outside of that, but we do know that it seems to make things that we need to not be on this world anymore. It makes them gone. Very few have heard of it, even fewer believe it, but we've all seen today, all of us for the first time, that Agent Victor's Nike bag is legit. when the job is done, and he says,
3318.20 3325.44 speaker3  I turn and look back at Keith.
3321.48 3333.72 speaker2  I was just slowly lowering my gun and jaw dropping. the past few days and putting it together, and gun is holstered, and I'm kind of just staring off. Fly, fly, to the stream.
