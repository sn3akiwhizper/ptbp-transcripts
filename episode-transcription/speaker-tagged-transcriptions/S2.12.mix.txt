0.00 108.10 speaker0  Salutations and vibrations, my faithful listenership. It's your large and in-charge DJ Wolf the Dog. I am sending vibrations of various lengths to you live from 694.2 PTBP. The only radio station. It's the only one, folks. Do not attempt to listen to any others. They do not exist. Hands off that dial. Do not turn your ears away from Wolf or else. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jared in Houston, Texas, who tweeted about the show and tagged at Pretending Pod. And now he gets to send this wolfy memorandum to Oliver in Mishawaka, Indiana. Jared writes, to Oliver Chestnut, you are my greatest and best friend. We have shared laughter and love, memories that will last until the stars are right, and most importantly, comedy TTRPG podcasts. The journey may be long and the old ones may be near, but so long as I walk the path with you, it will be a road worth taking. archimites checkin' out the cold Corbett house, or Delta Green agents vibin' on reverb, I'm glad that it was us who took those journeys. Well, technically you took those journeys. I was busy playin' God and found it a game worthy of me.
106.14 122.74 speaker1  Love, Jared.
117.90 132.78 speaker0  and to the original phantom of truth, Wolf the dog. Jared, thank you for this internet mail.

And now, it's time for two quick announcements from my producer, who scrawled this on my mirror and waited under the sink until I found it. No spoilies, but this is the final episode of the four part prequel art, The Death of a Salesman. Pretending to be people will be back in two weeks, on October 7th. Bloodily pickin' back up where they left off, who support us on Patreon and await new bonus episodes, we will have two new episodes for you in the comin' weeks. joinin' to play the one page RPG, Witness Me, based on Mad Max Fury Road.

Oh, and it's set in a cyberpunk future where everyone is immortal. Speaking of, they had so much fun with it that Zac is runnin' part two of that subway runners game live in the Dennison this comin' Tuesday at 7.37 p.m. Central time. All right, that's enough announcements.
296.02 301.54 speaker1  Gimme the news.
298.74 358.78 speaker0  Actually, the boys do a pretty decent recap at the beginnin' of this one. for R.I. Peter with Cruisin'. Cruisin'.
357.46 386.42 speaker1  but I'm a beefy boy. It's somethin' very similar to that, but you know. Every time we do the 30 seconds of silence, you know, in a horror movie where they're trying not to breathe hard so that the killer doesn't find him, that's exactly how I feel.
385.58 399.82 speaker2  You can breathe. I was crying. Eyes wide. I start crying. Dude, you can breathe. No one said hold your breath for 30 seconds. It's hard to do. Wait, let's see how old we can hold our breath.
397.98 409.26 speaker1  I think you can hold your breath.
408.42 425.18 speaker2  I'm not. There's nothing better for a podcast. You look like you won.
423.22 430.98 speaker1  and I was like, I don't wanna do this.
428.06 434.02 speaker2  because I would have never accepted your count.
433.18 441.62 speaker1  Oh, nice. So, I know we literally just stopped recording the last episode and we're recording the second episode now.
440.22 446.66 speaker2  It's nine weeks later. Sure. So we know what's going on.
443.98 452.10 speaker1  For the audience who may have skipped, just forgot to listen to this episode,
450.74 459.22 speaker2  Yeah, in your own words, I'm curious to hear what's happened so far.
455.26 468.62 speaker1  Well, so far, you wanna recap of the whole pink-a-boo? Well, no, no, no.
467.70 473.50 speaker2  Whose body do we have? We have Dr. Shark's body.
472.66 478.78 speaker1  Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we took it from the Quicksand.
477.38 483.42 speaker2  Yep, you did that for a while.
482.38 488.30 speaker1  With a doctor from the neckbeards. That's right, whose captain died.
486.58 493.66 speaker2  His captain did die, Captain Neckbeard. Yeah, and you changed his name. We did? Yeah.
492.58 498.14 speaker1  His name wasn't Captain Neckbeard, or we changed the doctor's name. No, no, no, the doctor, you changed his name.
495.94 503.34 speaker2  You asked him what his name was, I think he told you, and then he changed it. To what, do you remember?
502.50 504.18 speaker1  obviously.
503.34 510.14 speaker2  Yay.
508.70 512.52 speaker1  Yeah, he was scared, for sure.
510.18 520.14 speaker2  He was a bit scared, and he talked like this.
519.30 531.64 speaker1  Dr. Pisspants. All right. I think that's what it was. And then we got on our ship, right? You headed back out to start the race. Oh, we stole Neckbeard's ship. You stole Neckbeard's ship.
529.58 538.50 speaker2  I think we just told their crew, like, hey, you're with us now, right?
536.66 540.52 speaker1  Yeah, we sent one of your golden... Mrs. Knife.
539.52 546.80 speaker2  And Mrs. Knife.
543.56 560.54 speaker1  along with Dr. Shark's parrot. Uh-huh. Mrs. Knife. To go run the ship. Mrs. Diggory is on her way there to recite the ship. And then who do we have? We have our cool friend we made.
559.24 573.38 speaker2  Zach, pause, pause, pause. Yeah, what's up? Are you writing fucking Harry Potter fan fiction this whole season? so this can all kind of fit canon into your, like,
570.72 577.54 speaker1  wait till you meet Umbridge.
575.72 584.72 speaker2  I take her with that.
583.86 591.00 speaker1  Nice. Okay, Mitch is the guy that we have.
587.88 599.92 speaker2  Yeah, Mitch is on the back of the ship alongside. Oh, yeah, Edward Spitz, the cold-blooded butler. but he likes to think of himself like that.
599.08 606.52 speaker1  Yeah. That's my pulp Cthulhu occupation.
604.16 621.90 speaker2  And Joe, you're playing? Waverly. Wavy Adler.
618.08 633.66 speaker1  to be some sort of eldritch ritual race. Yep. And we have to, we're pouring oil? No, we're pouring blood, baby.
630.18 655.82 speaker2  We're pouring blood out of the back in a big circle. And he continues to chant.
654.98 682.66 speaker1  that to me on the phone. Yeah, I was just about to say that sounds exactly like the phone call. Making a call, Joe, yeah. Wow. and he told us all to take off our headphones, and as he told us that, I got a phone call from my internet service, because I had just recently disconnected, and they wanted to give me a survey. But as soon as I answered the phone, he played that sound. So loud.
680.62 686.02 speaker2  And he played so loud out of the headphones.
683.50 690.54 speaker1  And I looked at Joe like eyes wide open.
687.90 712.42 speaker2  because we thought my phone was making that noise. I watched you three idiots grapple with that. I kind of got it right away. Yeah, that's right. I played it, and I was still like, what the fuck, Joe? with your phone, and it was blasting super loud out of my own headphones, so I might have had some more context clues for it.
710.22 716.94 speaker1  Yeah, I was right here, and I was watching it come out of your phone, and I was like, hang up, Joe, hang up.
716.10 812.32 speaker2  Hang up. As the race begins, the smoke in the center and the race began. As the race began, you noticed the closest ship to the shore of the island, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy, one third of the entire circle around the island in this first push. one of the masts on the Swing Sing Brothers two mast ship. with the best guns, that is correct. from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy, who's the furthest away. The Swing Sing Brothers are next up. You saw one of their giant pillars of wood that holds up the bedsheets that make ships go fast. That whole shit fell into the water. I just assumed, I've never seen cloth so big besides that.
810.88 818.78 speaker1  Yeah, hey.
816.96 900.64 speaker2  Big sailing ship is gonna tell you and as your second ship in this race could not get moving. And you notice that they actually messed up their cannons, they fell over, their cannons are not operational and they were not able to move forward. The group next to you, the Port Deserters, these are the Union Jack flag with the bottle sewn into the middle of it, triple X across the bottle. I would remind my fellow pirates And I do believe that Alabaster Al Chernabog, we talked about the other two characters, but we didn't talk about Alabaster Al. What is he like when he's running these guns to this massive ship of the Port Deserters? You see that it doesn't all get through their extremely sturdy, girthy ship, but enough of it does because of you. The way that, oh, it's gonna start out real. No, it's nice, it's nice.
898.36 926.92 speaker1  The way that he likes to run the ship, he's very excited the whole time that he's doing it. He cannot wait to fire that next round until they've won the game. So he excitedly has told them to fire off the shots and he got so excited he forgot to tell the rest of the crew to start reloading because he just went and started reloading them. But they see, they're paying attention. What does it sound like when,
925.10 939.98 speaker2  and you lead by example clearly, so what does it sound like as you lead by example remembering in that moment, oh shit, I have to tell the crew? Oi!
938.68 951.00 speaker1  that means reload, just.
946.76 985.78 speaker2  of damage onto and off of that poor deserter's ship. And off we go to the top of round two. We're gonna start with Joe as the rope man and the wheel man for this large ship,
983.04 995.60 speaker1  It's only so smart because it only makes it an eight, which isn't great if I'm in a competition, but it's still a success either way.
992.64 1030.36 speaker2  The port deserters actually rolled a critical fail and yet they were able to use a bonus dice to avoid that, but they rolled a 98 instead of an 88, which is still a failure. The neckbeard ship finally takes off into the waters ahead of itself as the Swing Sing brothers do the same. Up in the lead, you see far in the distance away from your ship, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea, once again succeeds and continues towards the end of this circle. They're almost out of your view at this point.
1029.24 1034.02 speaker1  Are we not moving at all?
1032.60 1051.48 speaker2  of how fucked you are. You have made it 20%, they have made it 50%. Crit and then a success, but they started much closer to the shore than you, so they're gonna be able to complete their circle much sooner.
1050.32 1053.20 speaker1  and the fastest ship was on the outside.
1052.04 1056.08 speaker2  The slowest ship is on the inside, they just crit it and succeeded.
1054.84 1063.88 speaker1  I don't think we need to worry about this that much right now. And so like distance wise, you said we can barely see them. Yeah, you can barely see them,
1061.24 1090.16 speaker2  but just through the distance there, you see that they absolutely wreck shop on the Swing Sing brothers. And the Swing Sing brothers ship is moving forward in space, obviously. We're in space now?
1087.88 1104.36 speaker1  Hell yeah, dude.
1100.28 1128.76 speaker2  you see it disappear behind neck beard ship. And then when it passes through on the other side, you see that it is basically emaciated. It is the skeleton of a ship. It has been absolutely ripped apart by cannons and those wire things with the balls, connecting with the wire, just like taking out everyone. Chain shot. Benoit balls. It's called chain shot.
1127.48 1132.60 speaker1  Benoit balls, I'm pretty sure.
1131.76 1166.48 speaker2  Emaciated means. Yeah, they're all really hungry. Yeah. That ship looks so hungry. I would say this has been hacked to bits. Yeah, like to the points where you can see its ribs. Ship Akimbo passed the other ship in the distance. That was something I saw on the Discord.
1164.94 1169.38 speaker1  You don't actually use Akimbo wrong.
1168.40 1195.46 speaker2  Fuck yeah. Thanks for sticking up for me now. Jesus. Oh yeah, you mean where thousands of people will hear it The Sweeting Brothers. They're dunzo beans. They're dunzoed? Absolutely dunzo beans. And with that, we move on to the gunning phase for Death of a Salesman. You have one ship within your sights. It is the Port Deserters.
1193.64 1200.46 speaker1  The Port Deserters were the fast guys And they failed their second check, yeah.
1199.30 1204.06 speaker2  You are ahead of them.
1203.22 1225.54 speaker1  We've reloaded. That means reload. No, oi means reload. Oi oi means fire. A third of the crew is confused
1224.70 1233.18 speaker2  You're not a confederate. Oh, there it is. That's a goner.
1229.94 1244.70 speaker1  It's a 42 on 80. And a five on the D8.
1242.54 1275.02 speaker2  Makes for seven points of damage. than you did last time to the Port Deserters. And they have finally noticed. to where some heads are actually popping up on the top deck. And they're looking about. whose head pops out just in time
1273.10 1277.10 speaker1  You fucking patriot.
1275.02 1282.78 speaker2  He gets absolutely patriotic. That seems rad.
1281.06 1288.70 speaker1  I had not seen that movie in years. I forgot that fucking Mel Gibson is the head
1285.20 1297.84 speaker2  of a family of benevolent slave owners. Yeah. I did not, yeah. And it's like, it's weird.
1296.26 1304.22 speaker1  It is, it is, yeah. It's very American. Could have easily.
1302.26 1315.48 speaker2  Dude, that guy makes a lot of those, huh? Didn't pick up on that. Did pick up on the hatchet that goes to the guy's skull. That's stuck with me ever since.
1313.52 1330.76 speaker1  The guy getting fucking his head blown off by the cannon.
1329.92 1334.32 speaker2  And then. Patriot style.
1331.60 1337.30 speaker1  The, over the intercom of this.
1334.32 1355.74 speaker2  His head is emancipated from his body. Team Slayer. Thomas, next to you, Mitch Diggory is continuing with his Er-wah-doh-nyeh-nyeh.
1352.70 1363.46 speaker1  were complicated, but it's just a fucking Little John song. I thought you said Elton John. And then he's like.
1362.62 1365.98 speaker2  And I was. You were like racking your brain.
1364.66 1370.94 speaker1  I was trying so hard. I'm like, it doesn't make any sense to me.
1370.10 1416.94 speaker2  What? What? he's rapidly like thinking, what is the point of Mitch? I could do this. I got a ship all eat up. It's emaciated. Yeah. No, all I'm trying to say is gone mostly. Most of their ship is just gone.
1415.54 1422.30 speaker1  And then there were three.
1418.70 1427.60 speaker2  Look at the bastards drowning and feeding the sharks.
1426.14 1452.90 speaker1  Reload, but fuck.
1447.90 1454.38 speaker2  I need a roll for sailing from Sir Wavy Adler.
1453.18 1459.18 speaker1  Can I use rope to help him?
1458.34 1460.94 speaker2  I don't want to help him.
1459.18 1466.42 speaker1  And what are sails?
1463.86 1508.66 speaker2  so that it attaches easier to the mast, which I learned in my head recently is the wood part. Mask. You got a what? Seven. Oh, that is a success. Yes, I believe that is a success. who, while lively, seem to be more concerned about the damage you've done to their ship than actually moving forward in any measurable way. The neckbeards, however, do succeed and move forward. They're actually about even with you now. And you see that you are both catching up, slowly but certainly surely, to fancy pyromancy on the damn sea.
1507.62 1520.34 speaker1  We're catching on them.
1516.06 1546.06 speaker2  you see a cannonball four times bigger than you've seen on any ship you've been on So it's across from you in the water and you just see that, and as it hits the water, it splashes you. They are desperately trying to patch the hole as water is lapping up inside.
1545.22 1550.34 speaker1  Was it the pyromancy? It was the pyromancy, right. Or did it come from the island?
1547.78 1611.62 speaker2  You can certainly roll. Hell yeah. That's a critical success. you hold up. And as you lengthen it out, you see, who got patrioted inside the ship. but just through the view, you can make out the ship of fancy pyromancy on the damn sea with its smoking, massive cannon that they've dragged out. They didn't even try to move forward this round. No one was manning the sails. They just dragged out this massive cannon to take this shot.
1610.10 1619.02 speaker1  They got the mother of all cannons on that ship over there, boys!
1615.48 1636.50 speaker2  we got them neckbeards is to be our sacrificial goat. I say let them take that shot. To distract the pyromancy, we put everything we got next time into moving forward. between us and them as long as we can.
1634.46 1643.12 speaker1  and I know this isn't how monkeys hear, but you don't hear any sounds coming out of the whistle.
1639.48 1650.18 speaker2  It's my monkey whistle. Exactly.
1649.06 1653.96 speaker1  No, you wouldn't say, oh, sorry, because you can't hear it.
1651.46 1668.90 speaker2  Right, exactly, no, I didn't even. between the ships, right? Yes, yes, yes.
1667.22 1686.18 speaker1  So that is a pretty good time Cut it off. Moving on.
1684.38 1691.54 speaker2  but I need another navigation roll.
1689.74 1693.78 speaker1  Yeah, if you guys wanna take off
1691.54 1700.98 speaker2  from firing at the port deserters,
1698.94 1711.66 speaker1  to avoid being shot by that thing. You know how I like to mix chemicals and shit together?
1710.82 1724.46 speaker2  Does your character also do that? Your character does that too, I think, yeah. They say right what you know. For the listeners, Luke is not a scientist.
1722.62 1737.18 speaker1  Whoa, I didn't know that. Okay, so. If you're a biologist, then what's wrong with me? Oh, Joe just pulled down his pants. Oh my God, there is.
1736.34 1756.58 speaker2  Look at that. Are you a sub, Joe? The people wanna know.
1754.78 1776.34 speaker1  that went unaddressed be addressed. When Luke says he has a minor in biology, what he means is he fathered a child when he was 15 I was definitely a virgin then, so you're wrong.
1775.38 1778.92 speaker2  Oh my God.
1778.08 1781.54 speaker1  Uh-oh. It's at 88.
1779.86 1784.10 speaker2  Can you re-roll one of them?
1781.54 1795.52 speaker1  It's a dang old crit fail and no, Zach, I can't re-roll it. That re-roll thing is going on.
1793.86 1809.54 speaker2  unable to complete this task, was Mr. Spitz able to save the day here?
1804.54 1820.18 speaker1  Okay, is this a time where I could see that things are going very wrong and now help?
1819.10 1823.98 speaker2  Didn't you already roll? He had not rolled yet.
1822.58 1828.34 speaker3  because I had my own thing I was gonna do.
1827.14 1831.74 speaker1  than what I was gonna do. Good play.
1830.06 1833.62 speaker3  What should I, anyway, I try to-
1832.78 1837.98 speaker1  That's true. What did you roll? He rolled a 68.
1836.70 1846.74 speaker2  86 ain't gonna do it.
1844.62 1856.06 speaker3  I don't, I don't do that.
1853.78 1866.66 speaker1  I see that everything's going wrong and I'm like, I don't think I can help. That's how that works, right?
1865.34 1885.96 speaker2  They're not past you yet, but they are catching up currently and we are rolling again. Joe, if I could get a rope use, are you guys going to help him again? What is the conversation happening as you guys are failing at this sailing task?
1883.50 1912.06 speaker1  that we just don't move and don't fire for a round? That is correct. that has now been punctured. by what they've just seen. Yeah, I saw the giant hole being made
1909.62 1923.24 speaker3  that measure up to that at all and I couldn't. And then when I see that everybody's fucking up us moving, I kind of grab a rope and pull it, but I'm just staring at the hole in the hole.
1922.34 1938.38 speaker2  The hole in the hole. eventually, if we need to, we'll be getting close to it. It can fire at us before we can fire at it.
1937.06 1965.14 speaker3  that I think might be able to help. If Jesus Christ gets here soon It's a special powder that I've mixed together I'm making this shit up. I've got it all labeled. That's what I'm saying.
1963.22 1968.76 speaker1  I've got it all labeled down there.
1966.70 1975.10 speaker3  Let me take a turn to take a peek. Take a turnip.
1973.78 1976.94 speaker1  He's like, thank you, powder. Wow.
1975.92 1984.90 speaker2  We are pirates. We are disgusting. That's awful. That's truly awful.
1980.90 1991.26 speaker1  It goes into one of the three giant open sores on my face,
1990.42 2019.18 speaker3  Do you guys feel closer? I blame it on the damn monkey.
2017.10 2047.34 speaker2  to where you can no longer see them. They have turned the corner and they have disappeared around the other side of the island, which is thankful for the neckbeard ship because they weren't able to fire at them this round. However, the neckbeard ship failed miserably on their check to combat the drowning. What does a boat do? Sinks. And so this drowning boat.
2045.18 2053.54 speaker1  This boat is gasping for air. This emaciated boat is drowning.
2050.98 2076.60 speaker2  If I had to put it in terms of like math, I'd say they started at yay 20 or so and are down to three hit points on the ship. Not going well. And they critically failed and unable to help themselves with an additional set of crew members. They are actually moving backwards a little bit in space. came from that one shot? Oh yes.
2075.78 2081.44 speaker1  Horrifying.
2078.72 2129.90 speaker2  And the port deserters are actually picking up steam now. They are now two successful sailing moves in a row and it is on you guys to catch up in this moment. That'll do it. And you move up forward ahead of them again. You guys are inching ahead of each other at each time, just pushing nose to nose in this race. what do you think about evacuating some key personnel from the neckpits, including Mitch's mom and her barrel and you know, Jesus Christ. Getting them back on here.
2127.80 2141.38 speaker3  I think the way we get Jesus over here, put as many men in those boats or however we do it. I was thinking the parrot could bring Jesus over here but do you think the parrot could bring over a human being?
2139.22 2162.82 speaker1  You know, so we've got little boats that go between the boats. I imagine that's how you, but could it carry a man?
2160.42 2171.40 speaker3  and then I thought about the parrot bringing the monkey over and then I'm like, well, could the parrot bring a human over? But yeah, boats is what I was talking about.
2168.18 2176.70 speaker1  I don't know the capability of Dr. Shark's parrots
2174.86 2183.50 speaker2  but I'm gonna say no, it can't. But yeah, the boats.
2180.08 2189.00 speaker3  and I've got to go look for powders and potions.
2185.90 2194.74 speaker1  and that sends a few bread about boats. Yeah, the orders are sent. So if the parrot's coming over.
2193.62 2236.12 speaker2  Oh, the parrot's coming over. You can hear Miss Knife, the wings flapping hard against this crisp summer sunshine air. Salty, baby, it's salty. So as the parrot flies up, I say, Tell them to gather all the best men along with Mrs. Diggory and her barrel. You bring them back over here. Yes, do not interrupt the flow. That is of critical importance. Bring them back over here. We're leaving the mech beard, the ship and a weaker crew to their fights. You understand?
2234.62 2244.90 speaker1  Moving on. Fuck yeah, dude.
2242.86 2256.00 speaker2  and we are on. Joe, I need to know what way the Adler is up to as you roll.
2252.36 2284.92 speaker1  I'm gonna have to use another luck to make it a 59. I'm down to one luck, my boys. But I don't feel like we can afford not moving at this point. that we explain the luck roll, but he was turning, he thought he was turning toward the wind and he realized, And then he actually caught a pretty good stream. I'm all for narrative explanations of the dice roll. I just say that because there's times where it may be really hard to describe.
2284.08 2287.28 speaker2  That's true.
2286.36 2290.52 speaker3  I dropped the gun.
2288.28 2302.96 speaker2  That is one thing I do like about a D20 system over maybe the D100 is the implicit scale. One being shitty, 20 being awesome. You know what a 15 is, you know what a 10 is. Sure. You know what a five is.
2301.06 2313.76 speaker1  I usually do that and then I times it by five.
2312.28 2319.04 speaker2  I love the blackjack rules. It makes me so happy. I like them too.
2317.68 2322.10 speaker1  It's just, I don't know.
2321.26 2351.20 speaker2  unfortunately. Don't give a fuck, Zach. starts heading toward you guys. They're actually heading at the correct angle to meet you on your way, but they are going to have to make it around the port deserters ship in order to make it to you
2348.32 2360.64 speaker3  I would think that there are the rules of war where you don't shoot at a abandoning ship, you know. A tiny little ship.
2356.36 2366.04 speaker1  Unfortunately, we're pirates and we'll slay anything.
2364.96 2376.10 speaker3  Give it to me, baby. I'm down in, I don't see any of this happening. I'm down in the ship.
2373.68 2382.20 speaker2  to create this bomb.
2380.00 2387.56 speaker3  stuff I've made already.
2386.72 2388.38 speaker2  Ooz.
2387.56 2402.06 speaker1  Good. Ooz.
2400.22 2422.42 speaker2  What were you going to say? What were you going to say? between your stash of chemicals, knowing which one you use to make the heavy weapons like...
2420.06 2429.94 speaker3  of like just shit like I've made already. What's your heavy weapons skill? 80.
2427.70 2435.58 speaker2  How would you feel if you had to find the right gun out of a big rack of guns and used a firearm skill? Yeah, that's correct.
2434.70 2442.38 speaker3  Then I do it. I use my luck. Use that luck, baby.
2438.86 2450.72 speaker2  You grab the wrong one and make it to the doorway and then something clicks in your head. You give it a big sniff.
2449.00 2470.08 speaker3  wait, this is literally to make it. This is a stink bomb. This is a stink bomb. And so I run back and I grabbed the one that basically it creates a cloud where like fire cannot happen in it. So they can't shoot any weapons. That's what I want to grab. It's a cloud.
2467.92 2477.72 speaker2  It's a cloud where fire can not happen. Such a bigger ask.
2474.84 2480.64 speaker3  and it's basically like fire extinguisher shit.
2478.28 2482.72 speaker1  Like fire extinguisher shit explodes
2480.64 2488.16 speaker3  and so they can't fire any of their cannons because there's no fire. It gets all over their stuff.
2486.92 2499.56 speaker1  No wicks.
2498.72 2521.64 speaker2  And then I run back up. And then you run back up and that's gonna be your turn this round. I love that so much. Tick tock on these wicks. What is it? Dink, dink, the dink, dink man. Fuck you.
2520.36 2526.44 speaker1  Fuck you.
2524.32 2557.46 speaker2  You know what's really handy for you guys is that the port deserters make it so far ahead of you that the neckbeard ship can actually meet up with you this round with no issue. But I do need a sailing role from Sir Wavy Adler. Who? They will be next round. When they're aboard, can they aid our sailing like with more, literally more guys in the fucking like, in the rigging? If Mrs. Diggory and the monkey, the monkey will be a lot of help, I assume.
2555.30 2560.42 speaker1  We talked about bringing over all the best neckbeards.
2559.58 2562.54 speaker2  So you guys.
2560.70 2566.34 speaker1  All right.
2564.30 2581.98 speaker2  help the ship go faster, Zach? That's how sailing ships work. You've got one old lady and a monkey. Monkeys are way stronger than you think. How much advantage do you want?
2581.14 2591.68 speaker3  Double or triple. The hardest pirates with the biggest know-hows.
2590.84 2692.72 speaker2  you fucking mook. in between you and the shore of this island, seemingly every bit of blood that has been trailing out of these massive barrels on the back of all of these ships, all the blood is beginning to bubble on the ocean's top. And as it bubbles, it is creating a steam that is creating a fog that is- And masking all of your surroundings, the ship that is just nearby. I mean, it is right there. They're about to board. And then all of a sudden, gone in fog, you are completely surrounded. You can barely see the hand in front of your face and you can hear your entire crew panic over the sound of Mitch Diggory getting even louder. And you see that fog just billowing thicker and thicker And I'm gonna go ahead.
2691.60 2699.54 speaker1  I've got the perfect one. I'm gonna use spot hidden again to search them out through the fog
2696.40 2712.04 speaker2  and guide them in with my voice basically. Okay, yeah, that'll do it. They follow the sound of your voice.
2710.76 2723.10 speaker0  Get aboard. It's a contest to win. And you can tell by these dark seas
2719.04 2737.08 speaker2  It's a perfect tone to cut through this fog. And it is now blocking out the sun completely. So it is dark aboard your ship. Mrs. Diggory is still, what? With her barrel.
2735.08 2754.28 speaker1  Yeah, I get her and the barrel set up
2752.66 2769.06 speaker2  And he nods. And he nods. Cut his throat.
2767.26 2774.06 speaker1  It's still better to have two of them,
2771.18 2779.54 speaker3  I'm not around enough for you to hear me say that. No, you popped up on board.
2778.70 2785.70 speaker2  in your cannon.
2784.86 2801.28 speaker1  I'm a pirate, so.
2796.92 2807.60 speaker2  so you can see, you can always see Mrs. Knife a little bit as cutting through this fog, no matter where she goes.
2805.76 2829.48 speaker1  Like fucking crackers on that season of Archer, everybody but me hated. I love that one too. It's one of the internet's least favorites
2825.52 2836.20 speaker2  What is Wavy Adler up to as he's trying to get the crew working together while they can't see each other?
2834.32 2858.14 speaker1  and he's actually prepared for this. You enter fog fairly often as a sailor, so they kind of know how to navigate through fog. So he's doing whistle commands that mean the things
2854.46 2868.14 speaker2  And each one of these people who are working on your ship as the crew, they're just individually moving by themselves with no idea of like what is happening.
2866.10 2875.72 speaker1  That knows what individually means.
2874.62 2884.26 speaker2  can do that too.
2883.02 2888.78 speaker3  I'm like, he's on a roll.
2886.58 2896.34 speaker1  I almost stopped when I saw the look on your face, but then the way Joe and Zach got got, I stand by it.
2894.26 2928.60 speaker2  I need to roll through the fog, baby. These whistles are making it so you don't have to be at a penalty. It's a 63, I passed. Congratulations. You need three more successes to make it in a full circle. Something in your pirate bones tells you that you're exactly three successes away from completing this circle. Your navigational skills trying to figure out exactly where to meet back up with it. Please roll a navigation for me right now.
2926.38 2938.20 speaker1  Navigation's technically my best skill. I should have been using that more.
2935.12 2948.52 speaker2  the chanting from two other ships. Fuck yes. Nearby, but they're in the fog.
2945.60 2951.52 speaker1  man, does your chanting have to be loud?
2948.52 2961.86 speaker2  He gets a confused look on his face.
2961.04 2994.68 speaker1  Blerp. Oh no. She fucked up, she broke the chant. Hey, hey, Zach fucked up. Oh no. You gotta roll for Mrs. Diggory. All right. She chugged some grog on the boat. It's an 88.
2991.36 3009.00 speaker2  She coughs and then looks down and then looks scared and then looks at Mitch and she's like, I'm so sorry. You have to keep going for us. You have to keep going. Now we're together, we can make this. We can make it together.
3006.84 3015.68 speaker1  I just put my finger to my lips and give her a look like, we're pirates and we're gonna kill you if you don't stop talking right now.
3013.48 3036.92 speaker2  Your three faces are the only things that can be seen in this massive fog around and your hand reaches up out of nowhere to put a finger to your mouth and she quickly silences and then disappears backwards into the fog. Wavy, what do you think?
3035.76 3046.40 speaker1  We'll never know we were there. I love this idea. That's the idea.
3044.08 3052.28 speaker2  As soon as we bust out of the fog on the other side,
3049.08 3059.44 speaker3  I hand Jesus Christ like an empty iron ball.
3058.60 3065.52 speaker1  I thought he was a monkey.
3064.68 3067.60 speaker3  Emperor, tamarind.
3066.76 3072.84 speaker2  and you got a penguin.
3071.24 3078.96 speaker3  No, it's my monkey. And he, I hand him-
3077.92 3084.80 speaker2  but that's a penguin.
3083.12 3097.20 speaker1  but he's going to some one of these days. We're gonna go up too far north and that penguin's gonna die.
3094.52 3116.52 speaker3  is mixing together the stinky stuff and the not fire stuff, putting it in this iron ball. And then I load it into my shoulder cannon. And I wait until I can see where I'm gonna shoot it.
3113.64 3143.18 speaker2  you hear in the distance the crew from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey. You haven't been able to hear them yet, but everyone is being so quiet in this fog, except just in the distance, you hear some scrambling. Oh, no, we have to make it back to the original location. Yes, to make the circle complete. No, we haven't quite made it back
3140.16 3145.28 speaker1  I passed the sailing roll, it's a 12.
3143.18 3146.12 speaker2  And a navigation for me, please.
3145.28 3160.64 speaker1  Another one? Yes. 45 on an 80. Oh, yes, beautiful. Fuck yeah.
3157.56 3221.12 speaker2  the Port Deserters, and Death of a Salesman by finding the other end of your blood trail, which is now a thick, red fog that you can see. where the fog is literally boiling up out of the ocean, it's red, and your trails are each lighting up red, and these massive walls going up to the sky, but you can't even see the sky anymore. There's nothing except for fog. Mitch, I have one more question for you. What do you think? If we win, He gets a big smile on his face, and he shakes his head no.
3219.06 3231.66 speaker1  And he's gonna try to do a Spot Hidden role to find our blood smoke in the fog.
3228.26 3245.92 speaker2  Awesome, so that is gonna be your first success. I've basically given each team three navigation successes to find the other end of the trail.
3243.04 3264.42 speaker1  which implies some visuals, but he's a pirate. He uses all of his senses. and then sees a little wisp of red in the direction that he smelled that.
3262.32 3265.66 speaker2  Wavy, go ahead and roll that navigation.
3264.66 3275.98 speaker1  That's a 25.
3270.98 3332.06 speaker2  you hear a low rumble in the distance. And each one of you can feel the ocean approaching. Waves are heading toward you, massive waves from the island side. And then you finally get to the end of the trail. And then you finally hear it, this massive noise, this explosion of a ship, wood splintering in all different directions, and the cries of an entire ship's crew all at once through the fog.
3330.90 3335.98 speaker1  the piss out of me.
3333.90 3338.58 speaker3  I can't see anything, and I don't know if it was.
3335.98 3344.98 speaker1  In one group of pirates screaming in agony and terror, sounds much like another. Jesus Christ. I mean, I really thought that was some more,
3342.18 3353.16 speaker2  I thought I heard fucking Fat Johnny
3352.32 3365.86 speaker1  We're heading that way now. I thought, I thought I could. Oh, like they said that back then.
3362.88 3411.74 speaker2  and you can only see these massive walls that encircle the island. Boom, boom, boom, out like a bullseye. If you were looking at this from above, it would look like a Target logo, but with more of them. that the port deserters did not complete their own circle. They completed the neck beard circle. And in that moment, something absolutely obliterated their ship from the inside. Holy shit. And all of them are on the boiling ocean floor, Ocean surface.
3410.54 3424.62 speaker1  The roof of the ocean. or some shit. Yeah, right?
3421.78 3447.52 speaker2  it would definitely be your roof. seem to be equidistant from their individual, nice, finishing line. Yeah.
3446.32 3469.04 speaker1  Yeah, sorry. I didn't want to break you for language, but you did it right. Yeah. You said all those words. I thought about telling you that you got it totally wrong and gaslighting you. I know. I thought about being like Zach thinks equidistant means the same distance. It does though. Oh yeah.
3467.04 3474.84 speaker2  I couldn't see my face, but I'm like, wait.
3474.00 3479.66 speaker1  Equidistant.
3478.28 3489.24 speaker2  Where were we? We were equidistant, bro.
3486.76 3502.62 speaker1  I bet even if we talk about how like this will be a bit where we gaslight Zach into believing equidistant for a lot of the season.
3501.80 3522.80 speaker2  Okay, yeah. everyone sees you walking down from the top, walking down the steps to the deck, carrying what? The fog is dissipating at his sides
3521.40 3537.08 speaker1  Well, walking towards the back, right?
3536.00 3556.72 speaker3  on his shoulder. He lights a match off the cannon, hands it to Jesus Christ, his monkey.
3554.72 3590.44 speaker2  It's totally a monkey, but the pirates don't know what a penguin is. They're like, that's a penguin. He's going to kill that penguin. to give you an extra bit of boost. And the Timurine Monkey is going to assist your role by lifting your cannon and showing you, we're going to have to fire really fucking far because we're back to the, almost the starting line. And you remember Fancy Pyromancy on the DMC was basically out of cannon mode. And he was just like, the monkey on the DMC was basically out of cannon range
3585.68 3608.24 speaker3  Thank God I found a monkey with geometry skills and like way higher thinking than I have. 21 on a monkey.
3606.62 3616.56 speaker2  All right, go ahead and roll. What is this? It's a shoulder cannon. Yeah, it's a shoulder cannon.
3614.08 3618.00 speaker3  and giant fire extinguisher potion.
3616.56 3626.24 speaker1  Is this mounted on your shoulder and the monkey is like adjusting its trajectory or is the monkey on your shoulder and the cannon's on its shoulder?
3623.84 3638.42 speaker3  The cannon is on my right shoulder. The monkey's on my left shoulder adjusting it for me. like bracing me to do this, but I don't need to, so I mean, it's-
3637.08 3645.30 speaker1  He calls them Jesus Christ,
3641.10 3651.78 speaker3  The monkey lights the cannon ball and we wait.
3648.94 3667.18 speaker2  if they can succeed on this navigation check at the same time as Wavy Adler to find out if we're gonna finish this race
3665.48 3673.26 speaker1  I got a 94. I'm gonna use my very last luck to make it a 49. Fuck yeah. Hell yeah.
3672.42 3742.48 speaker2  When did you roll though? I rolled a 59 and they have a 60. Oh. But because of Luke's cannon going off in that exact moment, as they're about to reach their blood trail, it's right in front of them and the fog is taking over the front of their ship, but it hasn't quite made it to the back barrel yet. And in that final moment, right before you fired, the monkey tilted the cannon just a little bit further to the back of their ship. And you see this thing just- That's the stink bomb part of it as it mixes with the blood from inside the barrel and Wavy Adler leads the death of a salesman directly through the red fog, right through until it takes over Mitch as he says, what?
3741.64 3757.48 speaker1  Okay.
3752.48 3830.48 speaker2  completely disappears down into the water. Every other circle, each of them, you've never seen anything like it, erupting from out of the ocean. As each of these walls go up, blocking off the island from view, the fog fucking like, each one of these walls moves forward and the island disappears from view. The fog is the only thing that you can see. And in that moment, I need all of you to roll sanity. The wall next to you created a massive wave that pushes you out further to sea and directs the tip of your boat away from where the island once was. The fog behind you dissipates. There is absolutely nothing there.
3829.60 3836.44 speaker1  I don't know.
3831.76 3854.20 speaker2  Mother, mother, I thought that, is it over? she's looking off the side of the ship. You fucking fools. You rich fucking fools.
3851.88 3867.90 speaker1  It's just to throw them walls up. Where are my riches? Where's Wavy's riches? Where's the gold you mentioned? There's a big score. That's what we were doing this for.
3866.00 3882.94 speaker3  by the force of his shoulder cannon and he thinks everything is done now so he looks up at Jesus Christ, high fives him and stands up and then looks over at you guys.
3881.70 3936.50 speaker2  Where is the gold? Mom, where's the gold? You have completed exactly what we needed from you. but I appreciate the work that you've done. Yes, that's right. and look at where the wall once was. No wall, no island, no fog, it's a beautiful sunny day. No island? No island. That's a bit of a relief, isn't it?
3934.74 3941.42 speaker1  or are we alone on the ocean?
3939.62 3949.54 speaker2  Mitch is still on board, right?
3946.26 3959.74 speaker3  And I pull my knife out, but I have a smile on my face. But jovially.
3955.74 3973.18 speaker2  I mean, dad said that it would be, you know, like world changing or whatever. And I guess it did change the world, but. Kill some pirates and build some walls.
3970.02 3974.74 speaker3  Was your dad fond of you and your mom?
3973.90 3980.70 speaker1  No.
3977.82 3990.30 speaker3  Yeah, but he might want to get rid of you or something. Perhaps, maybe at some point.
3987.94 3999.50 speaker1  You better tell us the real fucking scheme here Your husband changed the world, how'd he do that? What changed?
3997.78 4009.92 speaker2  She looks at Mitch. She looks at you. Looks back behind her over the edge of the ship.
4008.90 4024.18 speaker1  I'm sorry, Mitch.
4020.26 4039.18 speaker3  Al thinks about having, grabbing Jesus's tail and having Jesus grab her before she falls. But what really happens is he grabs Jesus's tail and Jesus slaps him on the side of the head and no safe attempt.
4036.70 4044.58 speaker2  Yeah, she succeeded for jumping off the ship and she splashes down into the water.
4041.94 4078.06 speaker1  She fails her jump roll so she lands safely. On the next deck below. No, she jumps a couple inches in the air. There's no fucking gold except maybe for his father. But we won. We won. Yeah, we won.
4076.70 4093.94 speaker2  where his mom jumped off and his eyes are as full of water as they possibly could be without a single drop falling. Mitch, it's pirate time. It's hard.
4091.66 4107.38 speaker1  you tell us where you think your father's gone. You're gonna be like a prisoner pirate or something. Wait, but I don't know.
4104.74 4108.22 speaker2  Can I just be a pirate without being a prisoner?
4107.38 4115.54 speaker1  What do you know about? You're gonna die, Mitch. I'm sorry.
4113.94 4120.90 speaker2  who's like good at accounting. I could do that.
4119.06 4129.30 speaker3  I don't think any of us know how to do that. Yeah, I can count.
4128.46 4130.14 speaker1  You can count.
4129.30 4136.98 speaker2  That's irrelevant. I'm sorry, but that's irrelevant. No, he's already bringing out the best in me.
4135.42 4144.42 speaker1  I'm gonna make you a bitch intern for about like 24 months before you'll get anywhere near accounting after the stunt you've pulled. Do you understand?
4142.70 4152.46 speaker2  Are you the captain?
4151.62 4157.86 speaker1  There's no captain, it's a pirate democracy, except for you. You're at the bottom.
4156.34 4162.46 speaker2  Wait, I can't be a part of the democracy?
4161.46 4170.46 speaker3  I disagree with that. I think everybody gets a vote.
4167.74 4179.90 speaker1  until then they're provisional pirate members.
4178.34 4186.54 speaker3  now that we've saved the day, huh? I couldn't count though.
4183.46 4202.06 speaker1  Well, that's why we need him for democracy. HR decision, and I've got my knife to his throat. tell us your best fucking guess
4200.02 4218.92 speaker2  I would guess home or the last place he was, which was on the island, I don't know where the island is now. We can try to find the island. We can try to find the island. It's gone now. And maybe that's where the treasure all along was. Cause it's gone. I don't know. We're not gonna try to find an island school
4216.96 4230.32 speaker1  and tell us where the fuck home is. Mitch, if we wanted to find an island, how would we do that? You say that like that's something you know how to do.
4229.28 4231.24 speaker2  What do you mean where we were?
4230.32 4236.04 speaker1  We are where we were.
4235.04 4244.34 speaker2  that it is now. And he's like, wasn't the island like over there? And hey, Wavey, super not. But like, you know where the island was.
4243.12 4263.00 speaker1  No, it was over there. But I get your point. Let's just go park our boat over top of it. Maybe it's below?
4261.56 4273.68 speaker2  Mm. But it also, it wasn't-
4271.36 4287.20 speaker1  Those are like Michael Bobaro noises. the most neutral face you could make. You can see all my face right now.
4284.76 4289.96 speaker2  So I have to be very particular.
4287.20 4311.08 speaker1  You say try not to hide a frown or a smile as if Zach would like hide his disappointment from his bastard face. The last shot.

4480.48 4500.16 speaker1  It's 10 years old. Owned by one of our listeners. Completely disgusting.
4498.96 4509.36 speaker2  On their own?

4599.44 4615.00 speaker2  with. It was a dream come true. It was.
4609.82 4616.00 speaker1  thinking Beth and she was lovely, but we got to thank her friend that she thought was huge
4615.00 4619.00 speaker2  shout out to Travis. Big shout out to Travis.
4618.00 4623.44 speaker3  Yeah. Travis, if you're out there, hit us up.

4645.76 4657.68 speaker1  Yes. Go buy her book. Yes. I believe she said it was available in all bookstores. I believe that's what she said.
4656.68 4662.80 speaker3  There you go.
4661.80 4682.08 speaker1  Which part? The Barnes and Noble part. local bookstore. Oh. You don't read. You don't know. Oh my God. You fucking.
4681.08 4685.68 speaker3  Sorry I said Barnes and Noble.
4683.08 4692.68 speaker1  Barnes and Noble book buying bitches.
4690.68 4696.68 speaker3  But when I think of bookstore, I think Barnes and Noble.
4695.68 4698.68 speaker1  But I don't buy books from there.
4696.68 4698.68 speaker3  It's just that's where you buy books. Because my life is great and it's all my fault.
