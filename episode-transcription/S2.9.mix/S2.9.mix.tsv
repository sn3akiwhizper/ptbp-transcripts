0	6800	Due to a very special guest, we may have us some first-time listeners.
6800	12480	And those first-time listeners might be worried that this is the ninth episode of the second
12480	13480	season.
13480	18960	But I assure you, first-time listener, you are in the right place.
18960	23980	You do not need any prior knowledge to listen to this episode.
23980	28240	This is the first of a four-episode prequel story.
28240	34440	It was actually recorded before anything else for season two, and season two is not
34440	37000	a continuation of season one.
37000	42600	So no need to worry about those 115 episodes for now.
42600	50080	Just sit back, relax, and enjoy how nervous Zach is, while Beth May from Dungeons & Daddies
50080	53000	gets on our audio show.
53000	56600	Let's go to the intro.
56600	61520	Welcome, listeners, new and old, bashful and bold.
61520	66320	All are welcome in Mother Wolf's warm and damp embrace.
66320	76120	For I am Wolf the Dog, and I am cherishing you all live from 694.2 PTBP, the only radio
76120	84880	station that exists here in August 20th, 1694, the Golden Age of Piracy.
84880	90440	You know we got it locked down here in the greater Antilles.
90440	94480	Sometimes we get fan mail, and sometimes I read it.
94480	99120	And by sometimes, I mean, like, every episode.
99120	102280	It's time for a new Howlin' with Wolf, baby.
102280	108540	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Eula in Bochum, Germany, who tagged that pretending
108540	114480	pod in an Instagram story, an Uber guile thing to do.
114480	122060	Eula writes, please give this message to Klara and Robin, who hate things like this.
122060	127720	Without you, the world turns black and white, because your eyes take the color with them
127720	129280	when you leave.
129280	130280	Happy birthday.
130280	137140	Look at me keeping a secret, and give a kiss to Luisa, who is responsible for all three
137140	139160	of us listening to this show.
139160	142460	I hope I'm making tea for you right now.
142460	146180	As we say in Germany, br√ºder muss los.
146180	148100	Thank you, Eula.
148100	153400	This writing you wrote makes me feel happy, for the people in your life.
153400	154400	It's great.
154400	161380	But, um, can't help but notice you didn't really say anything about me, Wolf, the dog,
161380	166520	in this wonderful letter, but I'm definitely okay with the fact that I wasn't mentioned
166520	169880	a single time during this entire letter.
169880	171860	It doesn't bother me one bit.
171860	177800	I definitely am not going to cry into my pillow tonight when thinking about this wonderful
177800	182700	fan mail where my name is not uttered in a singular instance.
182700	187140	If you want to write up something for your mother, Wolf the Hal, tag at PretendingPod
187140	193220	on Twitter or Instagram, tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook, or write up a five-star review
193220	197720	on your podcast app of choice, and send us that receipt.
197720	201800	If you tell your friends about the show, I'll say pretty much whatever you want me
201800	202800	to say.
202800	205520	That's how this works, my babies.

241180	242620	It's R.I.
242620	243620	P.E.T.E.R.
243620	244620	with Cruisin'!
272620	289220	Welcome, everyone.
289220	293700	We are doing another short story here with PretendingToBePeople.
293700	294700	I'm really excited.
294700	295700	Joe, are you excited?
295700	296700	I am so excited.
296700	298820	Thomas, how do you feel right now?
298820	299820	I'm pretty stoked.
299820	303620	We've got one of our favorite role-playing podcasters.
303620	305100	She's a playwright.
305100	307140	She's a screenwriter.
307140	308400	She's a poet.
308400	309820	She's a comedian.
309820	315340	She's Ron Stampler and Scary Marlowe on my personal favorite actual play podcast, Dungeons
315340	316340	and Daddies.
316340	317340	It's Beth May!
317340	318340	It's Beth May.
318340	322340	Beth May's at the house.
322340	325340	Oh my gosh, what an intro.
325340	326340	Wow.
326340	328060	Welcome to PretendingToBePeople.
328060	333480	It came off of 30 seconds of deeply serious room noise where you guys are like, we need
333480	338660	30 seconds of silence for, and I thought you were about to say the name of a departed friend
338660	345060	or loved one, and I was getting ready for it, but no, to come from the energy of silence
345060	348860	into that lovely intro was so wonderful and welcoming.
348860	350260	Thank you for having me here.
350260	351780	Thank you so much for being here.
351780	353180	Why are you on our show?
353180	354180	Yeah.
354500	360260	Do you actually want to know something like really funny that is funny?
360260	361940	Are you laughing with us or at us?
361940	362940	Kind of like both.
362940	365260	I'm so sorry, but I did.
365260	369620	I did agree to come on the show because I thought that you were a friend of my friend
369620	377740	and then I found out that you weren't, but then you seemed chill, so it was all okay.
377740	379660	Beth, our podcast is actually good.
379660	380660	You're so lucky.
380660	381660	I know.
381660	382660	I feel lucky.
382660	386980	Yeah, I feel like I really lucked out.
386980	389580	That's kind of rare in the role playing podcast world.
389580	392580	Should we shout out that podcast that you thought you were coming on?
392580	397780	No, I just literally thought that one of my friends knew you for some reason, and then
397780	402820	I was like, Travis, I'm going on your friend's podcast, and he's like, what, I've never heard
402820	403820	of that.
403820	404820	He's like, who the fuck is that?
404820	407060	Zach has a good friend named Travis.
407060	408060	I do.
408060	409060	There's more overlap.
409060	410060	They must pretend.
410060	411060	Yeah.
411060	412060	That's exactly what we do.
412460	414460	That's the whole point of the show.
414460	416180	Zach, you never asked Luke how he felt.
416180	417180	Luke, are your socks wet?
417180	418180	Are my socks wet?
418180	420780	How do you feel about having Beth on the show?
420780	422780	Neutral plus, I would say.
422780	423780	Okay.
423780	425540	He just started listening to the day, Beth.
425540	426540	I'm sorry.
426540	427540	He doesn't really know.
427540	428540	No, I totally understand.
428540	431980	No, I'm stoked because I know a lot of people listen to you, so that's good for me.
431980	432980	Yeah.
432980	435940	He thought that it was a friend of his that was coming on the show.
435940	436940	I love Beth.
436940	439300	She's great.
439300	440300	And then you showed up.
440300	441300	I was like, wait.
441540	442540	Oh, damn.
442540	445540	Luke, she's really good.
445540	446540	It's chill.
446540	447540	I don't know why you're saying really good.
447540	451620	I'm like notoriously the worst D&D role player actually ever.
451620	453540	I can't believe you guys wanted me on here.
453540	454540	No, no, no.
454540	455540	We don't.
455540	456540	That works out really well.
456540	457540	We don't play D&D.
457540	458540	We don't play D&D at all.
458540	459540	We also don't play the game we play either.
459540	460540	Okay.
460540	461540	That's fabulous.
461540	463220	It's like Whose Line, Delta Green.
463220	468540	It's exactly like Whose Line, literally in that we're going to play some improv games.
468780	470780	A very tall man named Colin Mockery.
470780	471780	Ryan Stiles.
471780	472780	Oh, right.
472780	476780	You're making a Colin Mockery of us by not knowing Ryan Stiles' name right now, Tom.
476780	480780	I feel like Colin is tall for some people.
480780	481780	He is tall for some people.
481780	482780	Well, for some people.
482780	483780	That's true.
483780	485780	He's tall for me, but not for Ryan Stiles.
485780	486780	That's great.
486780	487780	Wow.
487780	488780	Zach, what do we do today?
488780	489780	Thanks, Joe.
489780	490780	I appreciate you asking that.
490780	491780	Well, I'm going to just go ahead.
491780	492780	Wait, wait, Zach.
492780	493780	What are we doing today?
493780	494780	Oh, yeah.
494780	495780	That was good.
495780	496780	I'm excited.
497020	500020	Thank you, legendary podcaster Beth May.
503020	504020	She hasn't left the Zoom call yet.
504020	509820	I sent you guys a message that said that your ship's crew has been invited to interview
509820	511740	for a mysterious job.
511740	512740	Our ship's crew?
512740	513740	Your ship's crew.
513740	514740	Because?
514740	516740	Because you four are?
516740	517740	Are?
517740	518740	Pirates.
518740	519740	Seamen.
519740	520740	Salesfolk?
520740	523980	You're on the high waters on the seas.
523980	524980	Your salesman.
524980	525980	Salesman, yeah.
526180	527180	Is that the name of the boat?
527180	528180	The Death of a Salesman?
528180	529180	The Death of a Salesman.
529180	530180	I love it.
530180	531180	Salesman.
531180	532180	That's way funnier than what you pitched in this part.
532180	533180	Oh, my God.
533180	534180	Sales.
534180	535180	Like, sale.
535180	536180	Oh, my God.
536180	537180	Oh, my God.
537180	538180	Sale.
538180	544620	First, you must sail to an unnamed island northeast of the Antaeus Maoris in the North
544620	546340	Atlantic Ocean.
546340	552660	You will then compete with five other seafaring crews in a bizarre interview of sorts for
552660	558540	the chance to win a job that claims to pay enough gold to comfortably live off for the
558540	560540	rest of your lives.
560540	563740	Hi, my name is Jorgen Stick.
563740	565660	Thank you for coming on the boat today.
565660	570640	Welcome to my crib.
570640	575520	We are here on the what's currently known as the Silent Doom, but oh, no, it actually
575520	576520	just changed.
576520	579820	At the last meeting, it's called the Death of a Salesman.
579820	580820	We all voted.
580820	590400	We have a democracy here aboard the Death of a Salesman and welcome to Caribs, the Caribbean
590400	594980	version of Caribs, and welcome to PTBP, Caribs.
594980	596560	This is the Death of a Salesman.
596560	600660	We're going to show you around who would be on the main deck right off the bat.
600660	602180	Wavy Adler.
602180	603540	It's Waverly Adler.
603540	605480	He goes by Wavy.
605480	607880	Is the camera crew now pointed at me?
607880	611200	The camera crew is directly pointed at you and Jorgen is just kind of like showing you
611200	612640	off like Vanna White.
612640	616740	He has a spyglass ad and he's looking out to the horizon and he notices that he's now
616740	618480	the center of some attention.
618480	620120	Oh, hey.
620120	623200	Oh, hey, didn't notice you there.
623200	624200	Didn't see you there.
624200	626320	Oh, hey there, Jorgen.
626320	627320	Can I help you with something?
627320	628320	Oh, yes.
628320	630040	No, I was just showing people around the ship.
630040	632200	Oh, we got a bit of a change here.
632200	637320	Yeah, I was just showing people around the Death of a Salesman and I was hoping that
637320	639040	you could just tell them what you do around here.
639040	640040	Oh, here.
640040	641040	Sure, of course.
641040	643660	And he kind of straightens out his jacket that's kind of tattered.
643660	648800	It was nice at one time, but it's old now and rumpled and licks his hand and puts it
648800	650040	through his hair real quick.
650040	651940	Well, here is the main deck.
651940	655640	That's the steering wheel over there and I kind of stand here and look out the edge there
655640	657600	and make sure we don't hit anything.
657600	660840	And then people come up to me and they ask me questions about things and I try and set
660840	661840	them on the right direction.
661840	664280	It's usually the direction the wind blows.
664280	665280	That's the secret.
666240	671240	I on a sailing ship it often is creeping right from behind a mass that's like right behind
671240	672240	you comes.
672240	676500	Oh, and me Christian name is Edward Spitz, but if you're on me ship and you know what's
676500	679640	good for you, you call me Mr. Spitz.
679640	680640	Mr. Spitz.
680640	681640	That's Mr. Spitz there.
681640	682640	Hello, wifey.
682640	684640	Jurgen's showing somebody around the boat.
684640	688440	Jurgen's got a camera crew.
688440	691640	Mr. Spitz, I was just hoping that, oh, I'm leaning right into it.
691640	692640	Oh, Mr. Spitz.
693000	695000	I was hoping that you could show the dear people around.
695000	696000	Oh, yes.
696000	698000	I've always been Irish ever since the beginning.
698000	701480	Oh, from the top of the bottom to the bottom of the top, I've been Irish and I'm hoping
701480	703200	that you'll tell people what you do on the ship.
703200	708240	I thought he was vaguely Scandinavian, but what I do on the ship, I do everything on
708240	709240	his ship.
709240	712720	I'll make sure this gross tub has an Irish civility.
712720	715920	You see, I sort of the food.
715920	718120	There we go.
718120	720320	We got to the final answer there.
721000	726960	Oh, but I don't do it like no typical pirate scowl, you know, I bring some class to it.
726960	728800	No, he does it up real nice, doesn't he?
728800	731880	Plus I can read, which is more than I can say for any of you.
731880	734400	The tines on our forks, sometimes there's three of them.
734400	738840	Yeah, often there is three tines instead of two.
738840	742040	And Geneva had that before Edward Spitz was on board.
742040	743040	Never.
743040	744040	That's right.
744040	745320	Things really started looking up around here when you joined us.
745320	748000	Mr. Spitz brought you three tines.
748000	756720	And then we, uh, we hear, uh, the wood slapping wood and a stumble emotion as Beth knows what
756720	760120	she, what she must do now.
760120	762800	Hey, what's going on up here?
762800	770080	Dr. Shark, uh, just showing everyone around the ship and, and, and what it's me, Dr. Shark.
770080	771800	Hello, Dr. Shark.
771800	772800	Hey there, doc.
772800	773800	Hi, doctor.
773800	776760	Anybody, uh, sick or anything?
776760	785200	I mean, just the typical worms and malaria, but as she asked, or as he asked the, a door
785200	792840	flies open and alabaster, Chernabog projectile vomits, and you see this pale skinned, like
792840	797560	long greasy, dark hair, open sores all over his face.
797560	801680	Um, his shirt is white and it's just blood and pus.
801680	802680	Just soaked.
802680	811960	And the camera freezes on you and then whip pans back around to Beth May, our guest.
811960	816400	And uh, and we get a good description of what her character looks like.
816400	822120	Well, he says, I'm sick as soon as she says, he says that,
822120	825560	Oh, Dr. Shark looks like Tony Soprano.
825560	833120	Um, and um, but like in like more twenties garb, I know that we're supposed to be in
833120	834760	like the 1800s or whatever.
834760	836120	I said a year earlier.
836120	838760	I don't remember what it was.
838760	843400	You said like in a mobster suit or whatever, and I pictured you in a huge oversized zoot
843400	844400	suit.
844400	852440	Yes, that, but like physically Tony Soprano inside the suit, but, uh, Dr. Shark only has
852440	853440	peg legs.
853640	856640	No, no, no biological legs there.
856640	858640	What sound does that make on the deck?
858640	862840	It makes a real like sexy sound, which you wouldn't think, right?
862840	866560	But it makes like, that makes me horny.
866560	874200	Just one clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk.
874200	875200	It's a real jazzy clunk.
875200	878640	I know what the four of us are doing after this recording.
878640	881240	Yeah, jerking it to the clunk clunk.
882240	885440	No, you don't know how this podcast is run.
885440	891040	He's going to make us stay in this room and make wood noises until we tap on wood in the
891040	892040	perfect way.
892040	895640	Until I finally get poley erect based on your wood.
895640	896640	Yeah.
896640	898640	He's like, that's not quite my speed.
898640	904440	Um, and that's how Zach gets wood racking.
904440	907120	I was clunking, I don't know.
907120	913240	And then, uh, Dr. Shark is accompanied always, uh, his permanent, his permanent companion,
913240	918320	a parrot on his shoulder, Mrs. Knife and Mrs. Knife just squawks.
918320	919320	Mrs. Knife.
919320	922040	Oh damn, that was good.
922040	926800	I'm going to use that exact audio for all birds in season two.
926800	927800	There you go.
927800	929000	This will be a bird-centric season.
929000	930880	There's going to be so many birds.
930880	934840	We actually haven't started recording season two, but I just put a bunch of birds into
934840	937520	it in my head.
937520	938520	So what is it?
938520	940040	What is Dr. Shark's face?
940040	942040	Like what do we learn from his face?
942040	951320	What does his face betray exactly when, when, uh, when Al, when Al busts through the door
951320	955160	with a, with a heave and a, in a wet, wet mouth.
955160	958280	Oh, well, I think he's seen this all before.
958280	963840	I think he says something like, Al, I said, if it is anybody's sick, that is anybody,
963840	972360	you know, Al, like, you know, Al sadly, sadly looks up understanding having heard this
972360	973680	many times before.
973680	976760	I mean, I could pop up the hood and give it a look.
976760	977760	You know what I mean?
977760	983740	Al has heard this before and vehemently shakes his head no.
983740	989280	In the age of sale that meant like opening up your rib cage and peeking inside.
989280	992640	We get a real good face shot of Jurgen's stick here.
992640	993640	He's got brown.
993640	994640	Does he do a gym take?
994640	996160	Uh, yo total gym.
996160	997160	Oh my gosh.
997160	1003920	As, as the, uh, as the whole classic interaction between Dr. Shark and alabaster Al, uh, is
1003920	1007120	going down like it does every Tuesday.
1007120	1012320	You're going to stick Jim's the fuck out of the camera with his brown chin length hair
1012320	1019720	parted in the middle, short goatee, early thirties with his early thirties brought to
1019720	1024560	us by patron modern cannabis from grand junction, Colorado.
1024560	1025560	Thank you.
1025560	1028620	Modern cannabis for Jurgen stick.
1028620	1031700	He's whimsically joyous when he shouldn't be.
1031700	1038320	So he, uh, he does a quick little jig in the, in the yak that, uh, the alabaster Alice
1038320	1040040	sicked up onto deck.
1040040	1043440	I think that, uh, that, that about does it for the shift, doesn't it?
1043440	1047960	Uh, did we meet everyone and you see an entire like massive crew of pirates?
1047960	1048960	Yeah.
1049200	1050200	We probably met everyone.
1050200	1051200	Right.
1051200	1052200	He met everybody who matters.
1052200	1053200	That's certain.
1053200	1054200	What was that?
1054200	1055200	Patron's name?
1055200	1056200	Modern cannabis.
1056200	1057200	Modern cannabis.
1057200	1060320	Uh, my mom lives in Western Colorado, so next time I'm out in junction, if you want to smoke
1060320	1064800	me up, that would be rad.
1064800	1066680	There's one last person that we need to meet.
1066680	1067680	Oh yeah.
1067680	1068680	That makes sense.
1068680	1075200	And that is the emperor Tamarind monkey that is currently eating alabaster's puke, which
1075200	1080280	is the only reason Mr. Spitz is not like screaming at you because he knows it's going to get
1080280	1081280	cleaned up.
1081280	1082280	Yeah.
1082280	1089240	I know your monkey will eat your mess.
1089240	1094760	And yeah, up to this point, alabaster was only just given like sad nods and he wants
1094760	1099320	more sad nods at you while he watches his monkey clean his mess up.
1099320	1100320	The name of the monkey?
1100320	1103640	If we don't know yet, because I don't know yet.
1103640	1106360	And uh, does anyone have an extra writing utensil?
1106360	1107360	Oh yeah.
1107360	1108360	Oh yeah.
1108360	1110400	That's what I needed right there.
1110400	1113000	I needed to write down your character names.
1113000	1115440	It's super handy for a GM.
1115440	1116440	That's a little pro tip.
1116440	1117440	A pen?
1117440	1121000	A pen is a great tool for anyone in your life.
1121000	1122000	And really anyone.
1122000	1123000	Yeah.
1123000	1124000	Wait.
1124000	1125000	Thomas, what's your name?
1125000	1126000	Edward Spitz or Mr. Spitz?
1126000	1127000	Mr. Spitz.
1127000	1128000	I love that.
1128000	1129000	Thank you, Beth May.
1129000	1130000	Yeah, that's good.
1130000	1132280	Joe, what's your character name?
1132280	1133280	Wavy Adler.
1133280	1134280	Duh.
1134280	1138080	I'm so sorry that I had to ask after you spent the time to create that.
1138080	1139920	Wait, Luke, what was your name?
1139920	1141880	My name is Alabaster.
1141880	1148760	You can call me Al Chernabog and my monkey that will get named later.
1148760	1151240	I love the promise of a premise.
1151240	1155320	Like fucking that monkey is going to get named later.
1155320	1159400	Alabaster has told him multiple times, when you prove yourself, you get a name.
1159400	1163040	Yeah, that monkey has to kill.
1163040	1167440	And then it takes the name of the first man it kills.
1167440	1172820	You guys head out past the islands that make up the Antis Maerus.
1172820	1174440	You can just say Greater Antilles.
1174440	1175440	What is it?
1175440	1176440	Greater Antilles.
1176440	1177440	Greater Antilles.
1177440	1178440	Mm-hmm.
1178440	1179440	Philly.
1179440	1180440	All right, my bad.
1180440	1183640	You can just say Labia Majora.
1183640	1188880	If you sail past the Labia Majora and into the Labia Minora, which basically all I was
1188880	1197200	getting to during this is, we're going to fast forward into a dark night.
1197200	1199000	Most nights are pretty dark, Zach.
1199000	1201720	There is no moonlight on this night.
1201720	1204000	You can't see the hand in front of your face.
1204000	1205680	Well, can't do surgery tonight.
1205680	1209240	Can't see the hand in front of my face, so.
1209240	1212240	Oh, darker shock is our commission tonight.
1212240	1218440	Will you please, please, I need my leg taken off right now or I'll lose my everything.
1219000	1221000	Could you stop bleeding on my dicks?
1221000	1222000	I can't, I don't know where.
1222000	1223000	I can't see the blood.
1223000	1225440	Darker shock can operate in the morning.
1225440	1227240	Yeah, sorry, matey.
1227240	1228240	I'm going to wait for the morning.
1228240	1229240	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1229240	1230240	I'll bring up some candles.
1230240	1231240	Oh, that'd be great.
1231240	1232240	Oh, okay.
1232240	1233240	All right, yeah.
1233240	1234240	Oh, okay.
1234240	1235960	Oh, official law.
1235960	1236960	And as some light-
1236960	1237960	Modern wonders.
1237960	1242440	As some light gets in there, you see Jurgen's stick is just up against the wall of this
1242440	1247960	small cabin and he's just bleeding profusely from his kneecap.
1248480	1250480	I just tripped down the stairs.
1250480	1256120	There's a bone sticking up out of his knee as the candle finally makes its way up above
1256120	1262480	and he looks right into the eyes of Dr. Shark and he's like, I just need, I just need.
1262480	1266360	Well, let me, let me console my nurse here.
1266360	1269120	What do you think we should do, Mrs. Knife?
1269120	1272520	Cut it off.
1272520	1275520	I think we got to cut it off, so.
1276080	1278080	Mrs. Knife never lies.
1278080	1280080	Mrs. Knife never lies.
1280080	1282080	Mrs. Knife never lies.
1282080	1286080	And Dr. Shark takes a big, what do they use?
1286080	1287080	Like, saws?
1287080	1289080	No, saws are pretty slow.
1289080	1291080	Well, they're like big surgical saws.
1291080	1297080	We just watched Master and Commander to get in the mood for this.
1297080	1299080	Yeah, and you have a little cork to chew on.
1299080	1301080	I'll give you a little cork to chew on.
1301080	1303080	They're literally called bone saws.
1303640	1308640	And then yes, I get out the bone saw and should I go for it?
1308640	1310640	Hi.
1310640	1312640	Can you roll a surgery?
1312640	1314640	Yeah, I'll roll first aid.
1314640	1316640	Yeah, whatever the roll is.
1316640	1318640	Are you not familiar with Call of Cthulhu?
1318640	1320640	I'm not.
1320640	1322640	I'm not, I'm not really.
1322640	1324640	I played it once.
1324640	1326640	Oh, nice.
1326640	1328640	Did you have fun?
1328640	1330640	I had a ton of fun the ones I played it.
1330640	1332640	Oh, shit.
1333200	1336200	I have not because I never subscribed to your Patreon.
1336200	1338200	That's fine. You don't have to.
1338200	1340200	I didn't.
1340200	1342200	You can just subscribe for a month and download it all.
1342200	1344200	No, I don't have a lot of money, Zach.
1344200	1346200	Subscriptions start with as low as $5.
1346200	1348200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1348200	1350200	Us too, I've heard it all.
1350200	1352200	I was going to say, you're a shit salesman.
1352200	1354200	Like, you don't have to.
1354200	1356200	When people are like, sorry, I don't subscribe to the Patreon,
1356200	1358200	I'm like, well, I'm not going to talk to you until you do.
1358200	1360200	Oh, yeah.
1360200	1362200	Luke goes for the total ice out.
1362760	1366760	Okay, so do you roll like D20s in this or what?
1366760	1368760	Oh, D100s, 2D10s.
1368760	1370760	Oh, that's such a good question.
1370760	1372760	Yeah, so are you using a mechanical dice roller?
1372760	1374760	I'm on Google.
1374760	1376760	Just roll dice.
1376760	1379760	Yeah, I just said mechanical dice roller.
1379760	1381760	I don't know what that is, but it sounds cool.
1381760	1383760	I want one of those, man.
1383760	1387760	That's a status symbol for role playing podcasters
1387760	1390760	is they get a really nice clacky mechanical dice roller.
1391320	1393320	Okay, so I'm rolling a D100.
1393320	1395320	A D100 is what we're looking for.
1395320	1397320	What's your skill in first aid?
1397320	1399320	My skill in first aid is 90.
1399320	1401320	Oh.
1401320	1403320	Then you're probably going to roll under it,
1403320	1405320	which is what we're looking for.
1405320	1407320	Now, wait, also Call of Cthulhu, if you just have a...
1407320	1409320	We're not playing Call of Cthulhu.
1409320	1411320	We're doing our standard role play game.
1411320	1413320	Oh, it's just madness.
1413320	1415320	We're out of left field here.
1415320	1417320	We're just rolling under to succeed.
1417320	1419320	If your dice match, it's a crit.
1419880	1421880	That is a success.
1421880	1423880	Crunch as a bone just snaps
1423880	1425880	and literally one of the
1425880	1427880	nerves is like hanging out
1427880	1429880	on the end and it's just
1429880	1431880	wiggling back and forth and
1431880	1434880	Jurgen is like, I don't think I can take it anymore.
1434880	1436880	I earlier forgot I had this accent
1436880	1438880	when I was bad. My leg cut off
1438880	1440880	and now it's just...
1440880	1442880	And then he's just gone.
1442880	1444880	His eyes roll back into the back of his head
1444880	1446880	and you look down at a bloody stump
1446880	1448880	that you've created and you know
1449440	1451440	exactly what to do next, which is...
1451440	1453440	Yeah, I say
1453440	1455440	good work, Mrs.
1455440	1457440	I mean, good work, Mrs. Knife
1457440	1459440	let's tie a tourniquet on you.
1461440	1463440	And then I tie a tourniquet on the leg.
1463440	1465440	And then I'm like, you're gonna
1465440	1467440	be fitted for a wooden leg.
1467440	1469440	He's gonna be just like me.
1469440	1471440	As he just lays back, tongue hanging out
1471440	1473440	eyes rolled in the back of his head
1473440	1475440	you can sense
1475440	1477440	just sort of a pride
1478000	1480000	of Dr. Shark and of the ship in general
1480000	1482000	from everyone in the room
1482000	1484000	including Jurgen Stick who's passed out
1484000	1486000	which is fun for everyone.
1486000	1488000	It's just like a really positive atmosphere right now.
1488000	1490000	I love that. Because somebody's leg got chopped off.
1490000	1492000	But also Dr. Shark has like
1492000	1494000	crazy mobster clothes
1494000	1496000	in the 1700s.
1496000	1498000	I used my tie to tie
1498000	1500000	the tourniquet. It was really nice.
1500000	1502000	Yeah, I really hate the one.
1502000	1504000	Everyone on this ship thinks Dr. Shark
1504000	1506000	is the coolest person in the world.
1508000	1510000	And desperately wants two peg legs.
1510000	1512000	How many peg legs have you added to the crew
1512000	1514000	like voluntarily?
1514000	1516000	I'll see. Let's check the chart.
1516000	1518000	Right next to the map
1518000	1520000	looks like 72 peg legs.
1520000	1522000	Weird because we only got
1522000	1524000	like 14 crew members.
1524000	1526000	He did me hand
1526000	1528000	as well.
1528000	1530000	And I hold up my very shitty
1530000	1532000	metal prosthetic hand.
1532000	1534000	And some people get addicted
1534000	1536000	and they just saw their peg legs off.
1536560	1538560	Shorter and shorter.
1538560	1540560	We got the shortest crew around.
1540560	1542560	Oh my god, then you could fit in all the little
1542560	1544560	you wouldn't have to have a nice boat
1544560	1546560	because you could fit in all the small cabins
1546560	1548560	if your peg legs were shorter.
1548560	1550560	True, we got the smallest cabins too.
1552560	1554560	We're going to have to think about that one
1554560	1556560	visually, but also
1556560	1558560	really, you're not thinking of the possibility
1558560	1560560	of just intimidating enemy crews
1560560	1562560	by having everybody river dance.
1563120	1565120	Just pounding pegs
1565120	1567120	on the fucking
1567120	1569120	speaking of enemy crews
1569120	1571120	speaking of pounding pegs
1571120	1573120	you guys
1573120	1575120	everyone wakes up
1575120	1577120	the next morning to
1577120	1579120	the sound of
1579120	1581120	someone having a lovely time
1581120	1583120	pleasurable experience
1583120	1585120	on deck
1585120	1587120	doing a peg jig?
1587120	1589120	total morning after peg jig
1589120	1591120	just doing pegging
1591680	1593680	just hanging on the deck
1593680	1595680	which is what we call our little dances.
1595680	1597680	Alright, let's leave.
1597680	1599680	As you guys awake in the morning
1599680	1601680	to this lovely exclamation of joy
1601680	1603680	you realize that it is
1603680	1605680	probably
1605680	1607680	Wavy Adler who has
1607680	1609680	noticed that in the distance
1609680	1611680	is a beautiful
1611680	1613680	beautiful island
1613680	1615680	Land ho!
1615680	1617680	With smoke rising out from the middle of it
1617680	1619680	there are four other ships
1620240	1622240	that are parked
1622240	1624240	what do ships do? They park
1624240	1626240	dock
1626240	1628240	or dock
1628240	1630240	off the coast a bit
1630240	1632240	they all have backup cameras
1632240	1634240	what did we do before these things?
1636240	1638240	Dude, I don't know
1638240	1640240	I live in a residential ass neighborhood
1640240	1642240	and I'm like how did I not run over
1642240	1644240	children repeatedly
1644240	1646240	before a backup camera
1646240	1648240	you didn't know, you didn't see them
1648800	1650800	I just maimed and moved on
1650800	1652800	so there are four other ships
1652800	1654800	their flags flying high in the air
1654800	1656800	as well as their little friend boats
1656800	1658800	hanging out on the shore
1658800	1660800	tenders
1660800	1662800	their chicken tendies are hanging out on the shore
1662800	1664800	there's four of those
1664800	1666800	little man boats
1666800	1668800	what are they called? tendies?
1668800	1670800	so the tendies are already
1670800	1672800	hanging out
1672800	1674800	so you guys are the fifth to arrive
1674800	1676800	what else we got?
1677360	1679360	that's pretty much all you can see right now
1679360	1681360	unless you want to give me the old spot
1681360	1683360	Hayden or
1683360	1685360	I'd like to give you a spot, yeah
1685360	1687360	yeah
1687360	1689360	it's a 41
1689360	1691360	it's 41
1691360	1693360	so my talent is that I can roll a bonus dice
1693360	1695360	can I just do that in case I get a
1695360	1697360	yeah, in case you match your dice and get a crit
1697360	1699360	I got a 19 on a 25
1699360	1701360	that sounds like such a fake talent, I believe you
1701360	1703360	but my talent is
1703360	1705360	I can roll a bonus dice
1705920	1707920	it's a really great talent
1707920	1709920	it says I get to keep doing it as long as I want
1712320	1714320	let me know when you crit and then we'll move on
1714320	1716320	basically if I'm not happy
1716320	1718320	I just get to decide
1718320	1720320	I also succeeded on the spot, Hayden
1720320	1722320	yeah, I got a 20
1722320	1724320	I succeed
1724320	1726320	with every single person succeeding
1726320	1728320	I'm going to give you a full run down
1728320	1730320	so what we've got here is
1730320	1732320	we've got four other ships
1732320	1734320	I'll describe their flags to give you an idea
1734320	1736320	of who these pirates are
1736320	1738320	one of the flags has a
1738320	1740320	cannon that is wearing
1740320	1742320	a powdered wig
1742320	1744320	one of the ships has
1744320	1746320	the exact military flag
1746320	1748320	from Great Britain
1748320	1750320	the ol' chestnut, what do they call it?
1750320	1752320	the Union Jack
1752320	1754320	that guy
1754320	1756320	he's got a
1756320	1758320	bottle over the middle of it
1758320	1760320	they've embroidered a big bottle of rum
1760320	1762320	over the middle of the Union Jack
1762320	1764320	the next one is
1764320	1766320	a skeleton
1766320	1768320	with horns
1768320	1770320	and then a beard
1770320	1772320	that is not on the face
1772320	1774320	so much, it's just around the neck
1774320	1776320	area of the
1776320	1778320	skeleton
1778320	1780320	argh, there be neckbeard
1780320	1782320	it's the dread pirate neckbeard
1782320	1784320	of course you've heard of him
1784320	1786320	and then the last one
1786320	1788320	is two music notes
1788320	1790320	not sure when those were invented
1790320	1792320	quite a while
1792320	1794320	but
1794320	1796320	those two music notes are
1796320	1798320	like swinging
1798320	1800320	off of one ship
1800320	1802320	the notes are flinging themselves
1802320	1804320	away from the ship that is on the flag
1804320	1806320	as well, on the shore
1806320	1808320	you see a massive
1808320	1810320	statue, you're not sure yet
1810320	1812320	until you get there what the statue is
1812320	1814320	of, but as islands
1814320	1816320	ought to have, there's a
1816320	1818320	large humanoid statue
1818320	1820320	right on the shore
1820320	1822320	as well as some other just like
1822320	1824320	piles of seemingly ash
1824320	1826320	that's pretty much all you can see from here
1826320	1828320	and we're gonna get you guys on one of those
1828320	1830320	tendies and head into the shore
1830320	1832320	I would assume
1832320	1834320	Jurgen is getting over having
1834320	1836320	a quarter of the legs
1836320	1838320	that he had before
1838320	1840320	knee down on one side, I believe he is
1840320	1842320	about a quarter down
1842320	1844320	yeah I guess, yeah
1844320	1846320	court low
1846320	1848320	Dr. Shark as they make their way
1848320	1850320	onto the deck
1850320	1852320	I'm a doctor, sorry I was gonna say
1852320	1854320	I'm a doctor not a fraction
1854320	1856320	doctor
1858320	1860320	I don't care which number
1860320	1862320	is above another or
1862320	1864320	what have you, but I'm alive today
1864320	1866320	and that's likely I made it through the night
1866320	1868320	because of you, oh yeah no problem
1868320	1870320	just don't mention this to anybody
1870320	1874320	laughter
1874320	1876320	he quickly unrolls his pant leg
1876320	1878320	to cover the peg
1878320	1880320	who would take
1880320	1882320	charge in this situation of
1882320	1884320	getting the crew ready to
1884320	1886320	go ashore, I can get you there
1886320	1888320	yeah I mean you're good at like navigation
1888320	1890320	and stuff so you would probably be
1890320	1892320	commanding the tender
1892320	1894320	I rolled
1894320	1896320	a 3 for my navigation skill
1896320	1898320	which means we get there so
1898320	1900320	slick and smooth
1900320	1902320	no issues whatsoever
1902320	1904320	in the boat on the way there
1904320	1906320	Alvester looks at Dr. Shark
1906320	1908320	and he's like
1908320	1910320	I found another one
1910320	1912320	and he pulls his shirt up and there's just like
1912320	1914320	another sore on his body but there's also
1914320	1916320	like hundreds of sores
1916320	1918320	oh wow that's quite the sore
1918320	1920320	hey Mrs. Knife check out this sore
1920320	1922320	what a looker
1922320	1924320	laughter
1924320	1926320	and Al feels like
1926320	1928320	happy, he feels like
1928320	1930320	yeah it is a good one and then he just puts his
1930320	1932320	shirt back down and like stares off
1932320	1934320	into the distance, yeah it's an impressive sore
1934320	1936320	laughter
1936320	1938320	oh now I'm doing mob
1938320	1940320	about halfway there Al
1940320	1942320	wants to swim because the salt water
1942320	1944320	really helps his
1944320	1946320	stings real bad in the sores
1946320	1948320	I knew a guy that we used to
1948320	1950320	drag behind the boat to get him to talk
1950320	1952320	so I mean as long as you don't say anything
1952320	1954320	we could drag you behind the boat
1954320	1956320	see how your sores like it or whatever
1956320	1958320	laughter
1958320	1960320	Al takes the doctor's advice
1960320	1962320	to heart and he uses
1962320	1964320	what is it, rope use
1964320	1966320	skill to tie himself
1966320	1968320	behind the boat, very well done, I don't think
1968320	1970320	you need to roll but I appreciate you going for it
1970320	1972320	he succeeded, yeah nice
1972320	1974320	I love Pope Cthulhu, yeah he succeeded
1974320	1976320	carry on
1976320	1978320	he ties himself behind the boat
1978320	1980320	he's having a decent
1980320	1982320	time back there, like an inner
1982320	1984320	he's inventing wakeboarding
1984320	1986320	laughter
1986320	1988320	he is the wakeboard
1988320	1990320	he is the wakeboard, what's Mr. Smiths doing
1990320	1992320	on the way in, Mr. Smiths is
1992320	1994320	Spitz, Spitz, Smiths
1994320	1996320	Jimmy Smiths is
1996320	1998320	Mr. Spitz is
1998320	2000320	eyeing the island with incredible
2000320	2002320	suspicion, but he also has a moment
2002320	2004320	to praise the navigation of
2004320	2006320	Wavy Adler
2006320	2008320	is I always thought being on a
2008320	2010320	sheer glass when you had
2010320	2012320	a window with Mr. Adler
2012320	2014320	it's just a matter of making sure that your
2014320	2016320	oars are in sync with the natural
2016320	2018320	motion of the waves, he's not
2018320	2020320	listening, he like
2020320	2022320	one eye is so
2022320	2024320	incredibly squinted at the island and
2024320	2026320	the other eye is so big
2026320	2028320	at you?
2028320	2030320	both dead on at the island
2030320	2032320	but he is just assessing
2032320	2034320	Mrs. Smiths don't trust no Spitz
2034320	2036320	change your name
2036320	2038320	Mrs. Spitz
2038320	2040320	Mrs. Smiths don't trust nobody
2040320	2042320	not even in Ireland
2042320	2044320	as you come upon the island
2044320	2046320	also I've got a monkey on my chest, I forgot about my monkey
2046320	2048320	also I have a monkey on my chest
2048320	2050320	also we're all playing I have a monkey on my chest
2050320	2052320	wait, wait, let's talk about it
2052320	2054320	let's not
2054320	2056320	what's eating you son?
2056320	2058320	this monkey is giving you sores
2058320	2060320	10 feet behind is
2060320	2062320	the boat
2062320	2064320	you're in the salt water
2064320	2066320	with your open sores and your screams
2066320	2068320	are haunting us all
2068320	2070320	but my monkey is there to give me comfort
2070320	2072320	Jesus
2072320	2074320	which is my monkeys name
2074320	2076320	now, Jesus the monkey
2076320	2078320	give me comfort?

2088320	2090320	yeah, love that
2090320	2092320	when you guys see this statue as you approach the island
2092320	2094320	you notice that the statue actually
2094320	2096320	has a lot of alligator facial
2096320	2098320	features that are alligator-ish
2098320	2100320	it's got a alligator face
2100320	2102320	it's a human body with an alligator head
2102320	2104320	it's an anthropomorphized gator
2104320	2106320	man
2106320	2108320	I'm not the only owl here
2110320	2112320	does it have a gator tail?
2112320	2114320	oh you're not sure, the gator tail might be
2114320	2116320	buried, however the long
2116320	2118320	snoot of the gator seems to make
2118320	2120320	a bit of a platform that you could
2120320	2122320	walk out on and as you
2122320	2124320	oh it's massive, and as you get there
2124320	2126320	you see that there's actually a ladder
2126320	2128320	up the back that
2128320	2130320	is kind of like scales, but it's a ladder
2130320	2132320	that you can climb up about
2132320	2134320	13, 5 meters, I don't know
2134320	2136320	15 feet up to the
2136320	2138320	13, 5 meters? 13.5
2138320	2140320	I'm a doctor, not an expert on the metric system
2140320	2142320	she already said
2142320	2144320	now I'm doing her

2148320	2150320	hit the beach, and as you
2150320	2152320	just slow-mo
2152320	2154320	scene of us hitting the beach
2154320	2156320	oh my god, cowabunga
2156320	2158320	splashylvania towels
2158320	2160320	flowing in the wind

2194320	2196320	it's a vampire themed
2196320	2198320	abandoned water park from season 1
2200320	2202320	I start climbing down
2202320	2204320	the ladder
2204320	2206320	are all these other pirate crews that we've now joined, are they all being
2206320	2208320	cordial to each other, or is there a fighting breaking out already
2208320	2210320	as these tendies hit the beach
2210320	2212320	you see that the other four
2212320	2214320	wait, the tendies hit the beach
2214320	2216320	the other four tendies
2216320	2218320	are empty
2218320	2220320	mad empty, and there's
2220320	2222320	no one on this beach that you
2222320	2224320	can see currently
2224320	2226320	but as you all are there
2226320	2228320	you notice that there seems to be
2228320	2230320	like a ditch or a channel
2230320	2232320	dug into the sand
2232320	2234320	along the coastline
2234320	2236320	parallel to the water for as far
2236320	2238320	as you can see, and it's got a red
2238320	2240320	liquid in it
2240320	2242320	let me see if I can tell if this is blood
2242320	2244320	not that I would do anything
2244320	2246320	I don't see a person here to fix
2246320	2248320	or whatever
2248320	2250320	should I roll to see if it's blood
2250320	2252320	I mean that seems a bit absurd
2252320	2254320	you get down, you stick your whole head in it
2254320	2256320	no, so it's definitely blood
2256320	2258320	you can smell the
2258320	2260320	iron as you approach the
2260320	2262320	long channel, it's about six inches
2262320	2264320	wide, but it is
2264320	2266320	blood, I can smell the iron in it
2266320	2268320	it's about six inches wide
2268320	2270320	it's wet, but not water
2270320	2272320	it's ironic
2272320	2274320	isn't it?
2274320	2276320	she liked him
2278320	2280320	yeah, as everybody's announcing it
2280320	2282320	Spitz is taking just a huge
2282320	2284320	fingerful and tasting it
2284320	2286320	a full
2286320	2288320	thirty seconds after it's been announced
2288320	2290320	it's a swig bit coagulated
2290320	2292320	it's blood
2292320	2294320	it's kind of a filmy layer on top
2294320	2296320	when you dig your finger in
2296320	2298320	you would have a film on your finger
2298320	2300320	as you lift up
2300320	2302320	it's coagulated
2302320	2304320	what movie?
2304320	2306320	that was a little joke about the film part
2306320	2308320	sorry
2308320	2310320	moving on
2312320	2314320	Mrs. Knife is such an asset
2316320	2318320	Jesus Christ, go look for
2318320	2320320	the other pirates
2320320	2322320	I want to send my monkey out to scout
2322320	2324320	oh, yeah
2324320	2326320	awesome
2326320	2328320	alright, send Jesus
2328320	2330320	I was about to be like, I'll put you in charge
2330320	2332320	how does your
2332320	2334320	monkey work, dude?
2334320	2336320	animal handling, I guess
2336320	2338320	a pass
2338320	2340320	what does your monkey sound like?
2340320	2342320	ok, sick, I'll see what I can do
2342320	2344320	alright, so
2344320	2346320	oh, better than I did
2346320	2348320	you sound just like Jesus Christ
2350320	2352320	sand
2352320	2354320	sand is like flying up behind
2354320	2356320	the monkey's paws and feet
2356320	2358320	as it clambers about
2358320	2360320	toward the tree line that is
2360320	2362320	on the opposite side from the water
2362320	2364320	on this beach it has hands, by the way
2364320	2366320	it's a monkey and then it stops really quick
2366320	2368320	on its hands, because it's a monkey
2368320	2370320	and it turns around
2370320	2372320	it turns around by putting its head
2372320	2374320	in between its legs and looking back at you
2374320	2376320	oh, it's a funny monkey
2376320	2378320	oh, it's a hilarious monkey
2378320	2380320	which you know to mean
2380320	2382320	there's somebody watching
2382320	2384320	boys, what do you say?
2384320	2386320	there's somebody watching us
2386320	2388320	holy shit
2388320	2390320	let's check it out
2390320	2392320	oh, so we watch them back
2392320	2394320	Wavy flings out his
2394320	2396320	spyglass in a really
2396320	2398320	efficient flourish
2398320	2400320	pulls it up to his eye and he wants to spot
2400320	2402320	hidden right where the monkey was indicating
2402320	2404320	awesome, yeah, go ahead and roll with
2404320	2406320	your
2406320	2408320	it's a 16
2408320	2410320	you want to roll again?
2410320	2412320	or a 56
2412320	2414320	alright, so with the
2414320	2416320	success there, you notice that
2416320	2418320	there is a tall, bald
2418320	2420320	overweight man who is not
2420320	2422320	paying attention to you
2422320	2424320	but he is just kind of like standing and
2424320	2426320	surveying the beach, he seems
2426320	2428320	to think that he is being sneaky
2428320	2430320	but he is not?
2430320	2432320	we got a guy over there
2432320	2434320	he looks like he's trying to hide from us
2434320	2436320	he ain't hiding too well
2436320	2438320	hey you, you look like you're
2438320	2440320	being sneaky, but you're not
2440320	2442320	being very sneaky
2442320	2444320	ya bastard
2444320	2446320	I start running at him
2446320	2448320	we've been playing the forest
2448320	2450320	yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
2450320	2452320	so as you run, you'd have to jump
2452320	2454320	over this little channel of blood, yeah?
2454320	2456320	I step right in it
2456320	2458320	step right in it
2458320	2460320	oh, that's not what you want to do in a Delta Green game
2460320	2462320	no, but I have open sores all over
2462320	2464320	my body, so, you know
2464320	2466320	oh god
2466320	2468320	it just gets right in there
2468320	2470320	so yeah, it like helps
2470320	2472320	it's blood
2472320	2474320	if you could expect these consequences in 12 to 32 hours
2474320	2476320	maybe like 6 now
2476320	2478320	also it's old times, but before germs
2478320	2480320	leg
2480320	2482320	right into the blood, running towards
2482320	2484320	the bald guy
2484320	2486320	he doesn't even notice that you're running at him
2486320	2488320	I yell, I see that he isn't noticing me
2488320	2490320	and I yell at him because I don't want to like
2490320	2492320	tackle him, but I'm, that's what I'm
2492320	2494320	about to do unless he tells me not to
2494320	2496320	his eyes get really big and he just
2496320	2498320	kind of stares at you with these big
2498320	2500320	eyes
2500320	2502320	is he a pirate?
2502320	2504320	no, he doesn't seem to be dressed like a pirate
2504320	2506320	he's just kind of a guy dressed like a dude
2506320	2508320	he's just wearing normal clothes
2508320	2510320	for like a person of this time
2510320	2512320	period
2512320	2514320	I give it a second thought and I stop
2514320	2516320	inches away from him
2516320	2518320	oh, hey
2518320	2520320	hey
2520320	2522320	I'm Mitch
2522320	2524320	Al, did you step in my channel?
2524320	2526320	I just look down at my leg
2526320	2528320	like duh
2528320	2530320	can we go check and make sure it's okay?
2530320	2532320	what's okay?
2532320	2534320	you heard something?
2534320	2536320	no, it's just my trench
2536320	2538320	and he just starts walking kind of
2538320	2540320	back towards the beach to check out
2540320	2542320	this moat and he's like, yeah, these are
2542320	2544320	my moats, so they can't be
2544320	2546320	broken
2546320	2548320	hey doc, in your professional opinion
2548320	2550320	is there any reason a man might have a blood trough?
2550320	2552320	in my many years
2552320	2554320	I've seen like a few blood troughs
2554320	2556320	but never any that people
2556320	2558320	willingly and a lively captive
2558320	2560320	you know what I mean?
2560320	2562320	not for no good reason, Al
2562320	2564320	no, we've got good reasons, but that's not
2564320	2566320	you're not here for reasons, you're here to
2566320	2568320	do the ship race that you guys
2568320	2570320	are in
2570320	2572320	if you want to come with me this way, let's get going
2572320	2574320	yeah, let's do it
2574320	2576320	I'm kind of like messing with the sand
2576320	2578320	to fix where Alabaster Al
2578320	2580320	had stepped on this blood trough
2580320	2582320	and he's just kind of making it the exact same width
2582320	2584320	as everything else
2584320	2586320	I'm Mitch, hey
2586320	2588320	Mitch, is this the blood of the other crews
2588320	2590320	who compete in this competition?
2590320	2592320	no, they're waiting
2592320	2594320	we're all waiting for you guys and one other crew
2594320	2596320	we gotta get going
2596320	2598320	it's obviously some sort of blood curse
2598320	2600320	and I dip my knife into the blood
2600320	2602320	so that I have the blood curse knife
2602320	2604320	that's fine, you can have the blood
2604320	2606320	you can have a blood curse knife, that's okay
2606320	2608320	I don't think that'll help
2608320	2610320	at least make somebody sick if I stab them
2610320	2612320	yeah, that's gross
2612320	2614320	well anyway
2614320	2616320	so yeah, these are all my canals
2616320	2618320	just kind of like
2618320	2620320	water courses, whatever
2620320	2622320	just going through
2622320	2624320	shout out to Nate Abbott from St. Louis
2624320	2626320	for Mitch Diggory
2626320	2628320	by the way, Diggory's my last name
2628320	2630320	I'm Mitch Diggory, it's nice to meet you guys
2630320	2632320	I love being useful
2632320	2634320	so I'd just really like to help
2634320	2636320	direct you to the way to go
2636320	2638320	okay, see you never
2638320	2640320	is his character description that he's helpful?
2640320	2642320	he loves being useful, I mean I love being useful
2642320	2644320	that's great
2644320	2646320	Zach's like, I wrote this scenario and I had a lot
2646320	2648320	of canals of blood to dig
2648320	2650320	so
2650320	2652320	it kind of worked out perfect
2652320	2654320	and a huge backlog of NPC names
2654320	2656320	that we need to get rid of
2656320	2658320	are you going to name everybody in these pirate crews?
2658320	2660320	no, it's just I'm Mitch
2660320	2662320	so let's keep going
2662320	2664320	and so he starts walking away from his
2664320	2666320	ditch and his gutter and his trench
2666320	2668320	I say we follow him
2668320	2670320	like this is the way, the money, right?
2670320	2672320	yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys wanted to
2672320	2674320	win the opportunity
2674320	2676320	to make a bunch of money so you never
2676320	2678320	have to pirate again or whatever
2678320	2680320	yeah, the pirate games
2680320	2682320	oh, is that where you guys have been calling him?
2682320	2684320	that's where we've been calling him
2684320	2686320	yeah, that's where I've been calling him, I've been trying to get
2686320	2688320	cash on, I think Wavy
2688320	2690320	is with me but I don't know if most of the crew
2690320	2692320	wants to see it, I like the Olympics
2692320	2694320	the Olympics
2694320	2696320	has a significant supporter
2696320	2698320	a lot of people
2698320	2700320	are just calling it the Crucible
2700320	2702320	yeah, I never read it
2702320	2704320	I've been calling
2704320	2706320	it the big thing, like we
2706320	2708320	getting ready for the big thing
2708320	2710320	I
2710320	2712320	always got to appreciate your funny way of
2712320	2714320	talking, Dottoshock, you sound like
2714320	2716320	you're from another time entirely
2716320	2718320	you sound like you're from another country
2718320	2720320	entirely
2720320	2722320	pretty wild stuff
2722320	2724320	Dr. Shark has had to go to
2724320	2726320	multiple HR meetings about
2726320	2728320	the other international people on board
2728320	2730320	yeah
2730320	2732320	obviously a mobster from the 20s
2732320	2734320	would have to go to a shitload of
2734320	2736320	fucking HR meetings
2736320	2738320	weird, I'm the only one who came back
2738320	2740320	from them
2744320	2746320	oh fuck
2746320	2748320	as you guys head off
2748320	2750320	Beth, I need you to choose between those flags
2750320	2752320	that we saw earlier
2752320	2754320	do you remember any of the
2754320	2756320	I want the neckbeard boy
2756320	2758320	yeah, well of course
2758320	2760320	perfect
2760320	2762320	so as you guys are heading
2762320	2764320	further into the jungle
2764320	2766320	of this island you're going through
2766320	2768320	there's a path that's already kind of been created
2768320	2770320	that Mitch is sort of leading you
2770320	2772320	down and as you guys are going
2772320	2774320	you really can't see too far ahead of you
2774320	2776320	because the thick is
2776320	2778320	he's kind of moving you through
2778320	2780320	this sort of channel
2780320	2782320	of a pathway as the jungle
2782320	2784320	kind of creeps around your head
2784320	2786320	almost and creates a cave
2786320	2788320	that you're kind of walking
2788320	2790320	through almost
2790320	2792320	and then all of a sudden you hear
2792320	2794320	a
2794320	2796320	oh no
2796320	2798320	fucking shit
2798320	2800320	no, this is somebody
2800320	2802320	else's fault
2802320	2804320	oh no
2804320	2806320	and
2806320	2808320	this is somebody
2808320	2810320	else's fault
2810320	2812320	from Mitch or a voice ahead on the trail
2812320	2814320	no, it's a voice ahead and off to the side
2814320	2816320	and you guys hit a clearing
2816320	2818320	and you see ahead of you
2818320	2820320	there is a slight fork in the road
2820320	2822320	and this other pirate crew has clearly
2822320	2824320	gone the wrong way
2824320	2826320	and the captain
2826320	2828320	he's wearing the hat and everything
2828320	2830320	and boy does this guy have a beard
2830320	2832320	but it is not on his jawline at all
2832320	2834320	or above his lip
2834320	2836320	it is just pure jaw down
2836320	2838320	and it connects into his
2838320	2840320	hamburger meat which is reaching
2840320	2842320	up
2842320	2844320	oh I hate that term
2844320	2846320	his hamburger meat?
2846320	2848320	we've covered this before
2848320	2850320	it's chest hair
2850320	2852320	apparently in one of the fast and furious movies
2852320	2854320	ludicrous calls his chest hair hamburger meat
2854320	2856320	and Zach threw that out casually one night
2856320	2858320	and everybody says
2858320	2860320	yeah that's wild lore to just be a part of a conversation
2860320	2862320	I respect it
2862320	2864320	though, so there
2864320	2866320	and so like I said his hamburger meat is just climbing up
2866320	2868320	to meet
2868320	2870320	the surly, surly
2870320	2872320	hairs that have made their way down
2872320	2874320	from the chin toward the nape
2874320	2876320	the nape and neck
2876320	2878320	the nape and nape
2878320	2880320	the lips, the teeth
2880320	2882320	and he is
2882320	2884320	drowning in some
2884320	2886320	sort of quicksand
2886320	2888320	and he is
2888320	2890320	I'm gonna go ahead and roll real quick
2890320	2892320	he is
2892320	2894320	he is up to his thighs
2894320	2896320	already and he is
2896320	2898320	waggling so hard
2898320	2900320	he is not being calm
2900320	2902320	he is just like
2902320	2904320	oh no, no everyone
2904320	2906320	hey, hey, Waverly
2906320	2908320	fuck, that's me, hey
2908320	2910320	do you remember me?

2912320	2914320	it's a great guy, I'm Neckbeard
2914320	2916320	and look at my crew
2916320	2918320	and the crew is all like standing around
2918320	2920320	and pointing at him
2920320	2922320	and talking amongst themselves
2922320	2924320	how far from like the edge is he?
2924320	2926320	oh he's right in the middle yeah
2926320	2928320	you'd have to get something long
2928320	2930320	like how long? to kind of reach out
2930320	2932320	maybe like five, six feet long
2932320	2934320	to be able to pull him out
2934320	2936320	that's longer than a monkey
2938320	2940320	I know one way to handle this
2940320	2942320	Mrs. Knife
2942320	2944320	cut the legs
2948320	2950320	no, no, no, no, no, no
2950320	2951320	there's got to be another way
2951320	2952320	trust him Captain Neckbeard
2952320	2953320	he's a doctor
2953320	2954320	I'm already up to my thighs
2954320	2955320	what are you gonna take me out the hip?
2955320	2957320	yeah, we might as well
2957320	2959320	Captain Neckbeard up and see a lot of years
2959320	2961320	and I never met a doctor
2961320	2962320	as shrewd as Dr. Shark
2962320	2964320	if he says your legs gotta go
2964320	2965320	they gotta go
2965320	2967320	boy let's find some wood planks
2967320	2969320	to sit down so we can get over there
2969320	2971320	to sew his legs up
2972320	2974320	you're like Australian now
2975320	2977320	that's what I'm gonna stick with
2978320	2980320	happy birthday
2980320	2981320	happy birthday
2981320	2983320	my joy, joy, joy

2988320	2990320	no I won't do it
2990320	2992320	he, as you guys are
2992320	2994320	literally having this conversation
2994320	2996320	he has sunk
2996320	2998320	he's sunk hip to nip at this point
2998320	2999320	damn
2999320	3000320	I'm sorry Nepo
3000320	3001320	you're so hip to nip
3001320	3002320	there's no hope for you
3002320	3004320	and his arms are just like
3004320	3005320	flailing about
3005320	3006320	and he's like
3006320	3007320	seriously
3007320	3008320	no one
3008320	3009320	throw me a rope
3009320	3010320	fuck
3010320	3011320	I can't cut the torso
3011320	3013320	so I'm out of ideas
3014320	3016320	okay you just save the head doctor
3016320	3017320	mmm
3017320	3018320	maybe, maybe
3018320	3019320	what about the neck
3019320	3021320	he needs his neck
3021320	3022320	well
3022320	3024320	I mean it's not his best feature
3024320	3025320	does he need it though
3025320	3026320	I mean we should ask the doctor
3026320	3027320	does he need his neck
3027320	3028320	for his bed
3028320	3031320	most people think you need your neck to live
3031320	3032320	umm
3032320	3033320	there
3034320	3035320	there

3037320	3038320	most people but
3038320	3039320	there's a chance of a miracle
3039320	3040320	ain't that right Nepo
3040320	3043320	well always good to give it a shot I guess
3043320	3045320	why don't you just pray
3045320	3047320	hips to nips was a four
3047320	3048320	he rolled a one this time
3048320	3049320	so now he's nips to pits

3054320	3056320	now he's gone from his nips to his
3056320	3057320	pits
3057320	3058320	he's about to sink
3058320	3059320	I get you
3059320	3060320	a one is a nip to pits
3060320	3062320	you're about to run out of rhyming biology
3062320	3064320	so you're getting really dire
3064320	3067320	you are fucked as a GM Zach
3067320	3068320	well next is his dimps
3068320	3069320	that's my secret
3069320	3070320	oh
3070320	3071320	the dimps yes
3071320	3072320	the dimps and then the temps
3072320	3074320	and then the temps and then your kaput
3074320	3075320	okay then he's fine
3075320	3076320	yeah he's fine
3076320	3077320	he's got plenty of time
3077320	3078320	yeah
3078320	3079320	then he's limps
3079320	3084320	can I like look on his crew to see if any of them happen to be wearing a rope as a belt
3084320	3085320	yeah go ahead and roll
3086320	3087320	on what?
3087320	3088320	rope use
3088320	3089320	rope use
3089320	3090320	fuck still no
3090320	3091320	I failed
3091320	3092320	none of them are wearing belts
3092320	3097320	they're all using both hands to hold their pants up
3097320	3098320	which is why they're not helping
3098320	3102320	no he failed his rope use roll so he can't identify the belts
3102320	3105320	they're all clearly ropes
3105320	3107320	as he starts to go under
3107320	3108320	yeah
3108320	3109320	because it's what's happening
3109320	3112320	it was good seeing you again captain
3113320	3116320	hey I know how to I know how to handle this situation
3116320	3120320	mrs knife off with his head
3120320	3122320	all right gotta chop the head
3122320	3127320	yeah I mean the neck you need sometimes but uh not tonight
3127320	3129320	not tonight
3129320	3131320	you gotta trust him captain he's a certified doctor
3131320	3133320	certified somewhere
3133320	3135320	always helps me
3135320	3139320	blood is just like pouring out of my face
3139320	3144320	so I'm gonna try to crawl across the quicksand essentially
3144320	3150320	to see if I can like chop off his head and get back before I start to sink
3150320	3152320	yeah that seems really good
3152320	3157320	so Beth I have here in order to crawl across this all you have to do is stay calm right
3157320	3160320	so you just have to pass a marbles check
3160320	3163320	so I want you to roll your marbles and see if you can hold on to your marbles
3163320	3167320	okay and what what am I rolling for marbles 100?
3167320	3168320	100
3169320	3173320	and you're gonna roll against your marble score which is equal to your power
3173320	3178320	okay where is my because I'm not sure I passed
3178320	3180320	P.O.W. at the top of the sheet
3180320	3182320	power power power
3182320	3184320	under sizzler
3184320	3186320	it's also under sanity
3186320	3191320	okay I rolled yeah I rolled an 88 and I have an 80
3191320	3192320	oh no
3192320	3193320	watch your marbles
3193320	3195320	watch your marbles
3195320	3196320	it was 80
3196320	3197320	okay well
3198320	3200320	that'd be a critical failure
3200320	3201320	oh no
3201320	3202320	you're not calm
3202320	3203320	we'll say that
3203320	3204320	you lost your marbles
3204320	3208320	as Dr. Shark begins to crawl out
3208320	3213320	your left hand hits this quicksand and immediately you are shocked
3213320	3217320	by how quickly your hand disappears into this quicksand
3217320	3225320	and honestly your gut reaction is to hold still but there's nothing inside Dr. Shark that can hold still right now
3225320	3227320	as you lose your marbles
3227320	3232320	I think he's just like oh my god oh my god stop no what oh my god ew
3233320	3234320	ew
3234320	3238320	and ew is the last word that comes out as your second hand goes in
3238320	3242320	and then the weight of your just moving forward pushes your face directly
3242320	3244320	as you're like ew oh my god ew
3244320	3247320	it's just ew
3247320	3251320	as your mouth fills up with this quicksand and you start going head first in
3251320	3253320	and now we just see
3253320	3255320	let me roll a d4
3255320	3257320	that's a four
3257320	3260320	yeah so you are head shoulders
3260320	3262320	it looks like she's doing a handstand in there
3262320	3264320	he's showing off
3266320	3272320	Dr. Shark is fully handstanded and your bottom half is sticking up out
3272320	3276320	so we've got no biological limbs
3276320	3279320	yeah we've just got two sticks in the air
3280320	3282320	do you have like really cool mobster shoes on?
3283320	3285320	probably yeah
3285320	3287320	okay uh Mr. Spitz steals those
3287320	3289320	no
3290320	3295320	Mrs. Knife is like every man for himself and like completely disappears
3295320	3297320	oh no
3297320	3299320	I can see a shoe still on your shoulder
3299320	3301320	I thought that part would be more on me about my shoes but
3301320	3304320	Jesus Christ go go check his pockets
3305320	3307320	I send my monkey and a pill for the rest
3307320	3309320	oh you're gonna drown your monkey
3309320	3311320	yeah now the monkey jumps out onto the legs
3311320	3313320	onto the peg leg like a zoo
3313320	3315320	oh I forgot it's a peg leg
3315320	3319320	like a zoo enclosure fake like limb on a tree
3319320	3321320	it jumps out and drabs onto this
3321320	3323320	they were peg legs
3323320	3326320	so you had awesome like gangster shoes
3326320	3328320	onto your peg leg
3329320	3331320	and then the monkey reaches in
3331320	3333320	what do you got in those pockets Dr. Shark?
3333320	3335320	oh I think there's like
3335320	3338320	like a bunch of like rings from people he's definitely killed
3338320	3340320	and like a cool like
