00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Hello, my friends.

00:02.320 --> 00:08.080
It's once again your fabulously ferocious furry friend, Wolf the Dog.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.040
And I am your host with the most,

00:11.040 --> 00:13.600
your hoist with the moist,

00:13.600 --> 00:15.440
your greasy baby,

00:15.440 --> 00:18.400
your large friend with the good hair.

00:18.400 --> 00:26.080
And I'm talking at y'all live from sometime here at 694.2 PTBP,

00:26.080 --> 00:29.680
wherever I am's best whatever this is.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.480
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Alchemy Yeti with Two T's,

00:34.480 --> 00:38.080
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.680
Have you considered doing something similar, listener?

00:41.680 --> 00:45.680
I liked it when Alchemy Yeti with Two T's did it.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.560
Alchemy Yeti with Two T's writes,

00:48.560 --> 00:51.360
Well, hello there, my dearest Wolf.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.760
You can call me Alchemy Yeti.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.600
Appreciate the howl.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.720
How's the gourbage been treatin' ya?

00:58.720 --> 01:02.800
Hopefully extra slimy for your eclectic tastes.

01:02.800 --> 01:08.720
PTBP has been a favorite of ours ever since the trailer you fine boys put out.

01:08.720 --> 01:15.200
We run various TTRPGs on my Twitch and YouTube with the wife,

01:15.200 --> 01:21.520
and you've all been a wonderful inspiration to start up another mystery horror series.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.200
Can't wait to ingest your future projects.

01:25.200 --> 01:30.800
Wishin' you the spiciest and most fetid under grime, Yeti.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.720
Well damn, thanks Yeti with the Two T's.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.080
But uh, Twitch?

01:36.720 --> 01:38.000
YouTube?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.560
What about MeTube?

01:40.560 --> 01:42.160
TTRPG?

01:42.880 --> 01:46.000
Trash today's really pissin' good?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.080
What else could that even mean?

01:48.080 --> 01:52.000
You may speak in words that only bring confusion to me,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.200
but I appreciate the kind words you said at me through the World Wide Web.

01:57.200 --> 02:04.480
You truly seem to be a gourmand like myself, with only the finest tastes in trash.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.760
If you wanna be like Yeti with the Two T's and write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,

02:09.760 --> 02:12.320
tag at PretendingPod on the internet,

02:12.320 --> 02:17.280
or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts and holler at us about it.

02:17.280 --> 02:23.840
If you wanna hear 30 bonus episodes, that's the $5 tier on Patreon.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.440
And if you wanna submit a name and description

02:27.440 --> 02:34.720
for a potential NPC and location to be used in the show, that's the damn $10 tier.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.840
And if you wanna watch a monthly livestream and play some Jackbox with the cast,

02:39.840 --> 02:43.520
get your mitts on some shirts that kicketh ass,

02:43.520 --> 02:48.560
or even play a gaming session homebrewed and GM'd by Zach,

02:48.560 --> 02:53.360
alongside Joe, Luke, and Thomas, as your fellow players.

02:53.360 --> 03:00.000
Now that's all also available over at patreon.com slash pretending pod.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.280
You know what they say.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.520
The links are in the show notes.

03:04.080 --> 03:09.680
Thanks to everyone who reached out with appreciation for last week's puns.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.280
I hope you can also enjoy creative segues.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.120
It's time for the news.

03:17.520 --> 03:24.080
Last time, our intrepid hero smashed part of Cicero Mordaunt's new invention

03:24.080 --> 03:30.000
in rages that ranged from dutiful to envious to cocaine fuel,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.920
before Lafayette J. Honeycutt showed off his radical fucking jetpack.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.600
And that certainly should've been the coolest thing in the episode.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.600
But then, after finding a dead woman in the snow,

03:43.600 --> 03:46.560
in a room upstairs with the window open,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.560
Elden Ring reached out through the philanthropist's mind

03:50.560 --> 03:53.680
to call out to the power he swore to help,

03:53.680 --> 03:56.160
let himself be used as a vessel,

03:56.160 --> 04:00.640
and psychic attack the top of Cicero Mordaunt's head off.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.280
And now, using a word that encapsulates that scene,

04:05.280 --> 04:08.080
it's Isabel Crane with Hollow.

04:08.960 --> 04:19.840
I didn't know a body could be hollow before its blood ran cold

04:23.520 --> 04:34.240
I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and ragged bone

04:34.240 --> 04:42.240
You were hollow when you spoke to me

04:45.200 --> 04:48.800
Hollow when you sang

04:52.080 --> 04:56.880
I thought you might be starving

04:57.680 --> 05:07.680
So I gave you everything

05:07.680 --> 05:11.520
I feel like I'm presenting a children's show or something when I'm doing it.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.400
You kinda are.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.640
Yeah, you absolutely are.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.600
That's how we promote the show.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.040
Tell us the story, Scott!

05:20.880 --> 05:22.720
It's an RPG show for kids.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.800
Once upon a time, there was an inventor called Cicero Mordaunt,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.360
and he made wonderful toys for all the boys and girls in the world.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.400
What happened to his head?

05:36.960 --> 05:39.280
He ended up a redhead at the end of the day.

05:41.040 --> 05:41.920
Oh, man.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.080
Yeah, Zach, you did something last episode.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.600
Welcome to Pretending to Be People.

05:46.320 --> 05:50.080
This is the fourth episode of The Thing You're Listening To.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.360
Oh, yeah, Pretending to Be People.

05:51.440 --> 05:52.000
I'm Zach.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.080
I'm playing Elden Ring, and I did not kill anyone last episode.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.160
Zach is not playing Elden Ring.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.240
He doesn't play video games, but his character's name is Elden Ring.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.760
Oh, that's why it's funny.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.440
Like, I just thought it was a kick-ass name.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.400
It is cool.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.000
I've been hearing people saying it so often.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.120
I thought I could use that.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.080
I saw it on Twitter.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.000
I thought it was a TikToker.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.520
Luke, who are you playing?

06:17.520 --> 06:20.320
I'm playing Checkers, a cult leader who talks like this.

06:20.400 --> 06:25.680
He's only 19, and he is in the middle of climbing down some ladder rungs.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.200
Is it going to be hard?

06:27.920 --> 06:30.800
He passed it already, it seems like, so no.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.680
All right, see you, Joe.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.200
Yeah, I'm Harvey Brewer.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.280
I'm a big, strong guy, but I hurt myself when I'm punching out a window upstairs up there.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.200
After some difficulty, I made it down to the ground.

06:43.200 --> 06:48.720
And my buddy here, my boss, he's an inventor,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.840
and I just saw him take off in his new invention.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.080
It's a sight to behold, I can tell you that much.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.720
Well, and who knows where Lafayette J. Honeycutt is.

06:58.720 --> 07:02.880
He was last seen flying off into the snowstorm with his jetpack.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.560
Yeah, because there is no better time to test a prototype jetpack

07:07.600 --> 07:09.280
than in a 50 or 60 mile per hour snowstorm.

07:09.280 --> 07:17.920
Lafayette J. Honeycutt did not bring a prototype anything to upstage Cicero Mordent.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.920
He brought a fully fleshed out.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.840
Do you know how many Harveys died?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.040
Do you know there's flesh on it?

07:23.040 --> 07:25.840
How many Harveys crashed and burned in these things?

07:26.960 --> 07:28.320
To get ready for this one?

07:28.960 --> 07:29.460
Yeah.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.080
Do you call it a jetpack, or do you have like a-

07:34.080 --> 07:35.920
Do you call them all Harvey, or do they-

07:37.360 --> 07:40.080
Do you think that my Harvey actually has tested this one,

07:40.080 --> 07:42.320
and it's the one that worked, and that's why he's still with you?

07:42.320 --> 07:42.720
Yeah.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.840
Or have I not touched it yet?

07:43.840 --> 07:46.480
No, you've tested it, and it could move your bulk around and everything.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.480
He's like, this is the one.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.880
Do you call it the jetpack, or do you have like a-

07:52.880 --> 07:55.040
It's called the X1 right now, but-

07:55.040 --> 07:57.040
It's not called the fuck you gravity.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.400
It's a pretty cool name.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.360
That is pretty cool.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.440
This is my my fig.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.460
FYG.

08:09.460 --> 08:10.560
The fig X1.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.120
Oh, that's it. I think that's who we are.

08:15.120 --> 08:20.560
You probably are like binging all of these so you know what just happened,

08:20.560 --> 08:21.680
but what just happened?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.280
Okay, but I didn't kill anyone.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.800
I, again-

08:24.800 --> 08:26.080
You exploded his head.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.360
Yeah, but again, because-

08:29.360 --> 08:31.760
More manslaughter than murder because you didn't really want to do it.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.960
How is it manslaughter?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.760
A guy died because of him.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.240
Exactly.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.240
I was only a conduit, again.

08:38.240 --> 08:41.840
That's like what you say like when you hit somebody with your car.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.120
I was just a conduit.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.280
Of the car's power.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.240
It was just the thing working through me. It wasn't me.

08:58.240 --> 08:58.740
Right.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.040
My hands are clean.

09:01.760 --> 09:08.240
It was an extreme instance of psychic croquet where you croquet a guy's head open.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.160
You hit the ball a little too hard.

09:12.160 --> 09:16.640
He is the ball in this, but he was hit. He's the implement of psychic croquet.

09:17.680 --> 09:24.960
Scott, when the camera pans to Elden Ring, is he like covered in blood?

09:24.960 --> 09:27.120
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, head to foot.

09:27.120 --> 09:31.920
Well, not just blood, but cranial tissue and probably bits of skull as well.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.680
I think we'll deal with the aftermath of that in a few moments.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.120
Before then, I really want to catch up with Lafayette.

09:39.120 --> 09:39.620
Me too.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.420
Yes, I'm very intrigued.

09:42.420 --> 09:47.060
I think we all would, but what if he just comes jetpacking through the window at the climax?

09:49.860 --> 09:50.740
Oh no, you're not getting off that.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.100
That's next episode.

09:55.060 --> 10:00.980
So Lafayette is hurtling through the air in this experimental jetpack

10:02.340 --> 10:04.740
in high winds and no visibility.

10:05.540 --> 10:08.340
You have no real idea where you're going.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.860
Do you want to give me a luck roll to see where you end up?

10:13.860 --> 10:19.460
Instead of that, I'm going to spend 10 luck with resourceful,

10:19.460 --> 10:22.020
and the jetpack has a built-in compass.

10:24.020 --> 10:27.460
You should say a parachute too, just in case.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.900
The jetpack is also an inspector gadget everything.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.040
He is.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.620
Inspector jetpack.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.300
10 luck spent very well.

10:35.300 --> 10:41.700
No, there is a little cool, like he used some of Mordaunt's radon dental paste

10:41.700 --> 10:45.780
to make a glow-in-the-dark little display for his compass,

10:46.340 --> 10:49.380
and so he's looking at it on his wrist,

10:49.380 --> 10:53.220
and he's like guiding the jetpack straight towards the house.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.660
As David Bowie plays.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.660
Rocket man!

10:56.740 --> 11:01.940
What skill do you suppose you use to control a jetpack in high winds and no visibility?

11:04.660 --> 11:06.660
It's almost like you're swimming in the air.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.220
Do you have like a skill for weird science?

11:11.140 --> 11:14.500
No, that's a talent, and I think it gave me 10 in mythos.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.060
Okay, so can you use like mechanical engineering?

11:17.060 --> 11:20.980
I would like to argue that, but I bet it would be more like pilot.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.700
Yeah, I think pilot would be about right.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.020
Oh nice, so you have a base of 1% in that.

11:26.020 --> 11:29.860
Yeah, I'm hoping that you've put points there, or you're really lucky.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.700
Seeing as how you built yourself a jetpack,

11:33.460 --> 11:35.140
it'd be weird if you didn't have points there.

11:35.140 --> 11:36.340
I'm trying to find it on the sheet.

11:36.340 --> 11:40.340
I thought you were trying to take points off of other skills and put them into pilot.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.780
No, I'm not doing that to drive auto.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.660
What would never happen is that he thought of the jetpack

11:46.660 --> 11:48.340
as we were sitting down to record this.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.540
There's no way that there's not a chance.

11:51.540 --> 11:58.420
That is of course not what happened, which is why I have 55 in pilot and nothing in drive auto.

11:59.780 --> 12:02.100
Wait, no, sorry, that's a baseline 20 in drive auto.

12:02.100 --> 12:05.700
I have 35 in pilot, just enough to make it spicy.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.460
Love it. That's spicy as hell, baby.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.100
Let's see how this goes.

12:10.100 --> 12:10.660
62.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.380
That's too much.

12:13.380 --> 12:16.420
Are we still playing 69 as crit goodness?

12:16.420 --> 12:16.920
Always.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.140
But it wasn't 69.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.260
Nope, it was 62.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.620
I played on another podcast recently that did that.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.460
I can't remember which one it was.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.540
It was our Scott, you're with us now.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.940
No, this was like in the last two months.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.220
They probably got it from us.

12:36.660 --> 12:38.900
It's not like a really easy thing to think of.

12:40.420 --> 12:44.180
Wait, could he gain seven luck and make his roll a 69?

12:48.180 --> 12:49.540
That's the face of a yes.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.260
That would put me at 29 luck.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.220
No, you said Dane.

12:55.220 --> 12:58.500
Yeah, you would gain seven because to add to your score.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.180
Because you went up on the skill.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.500
Right, because you want to add to the roll.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.180
Right, to make it a 69.

13:04.180 --> 13:07.380
So I gained seven luck and I make it a 69.

13:08.740 --> 13:09.860
So we do that, Scott.

13:09.860 --> 13:10.360
We do that.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.060
Can I just cut all this short and say no?

13:16.340 --> 13:17.860
You can lick whatever you want, but...

13:20.500 --> 13:21.300
He let us lick.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.580
The world had realistic consequences for it.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.340
We got pretty lucky.

13:27.300 --> 13:32.580
So yes, there you are barreling through the air in your jet pack,

13:32.580 --> 13:34.820
unable to see where you're going.

13:34.820 --> 13:39.060
You're getting thrown around by the winds.

13:39.060 --> 13:42.020
It's almost completely uncontrollable at the moment.

13:42.980 --> 13:47.780
But you are at least navigating in roughly the right direction.

13:48.580 --> 13:54.500
But at the moment, it does look like your options are going to be limited

13:54.500 --> 14:00.100
to trying to maybe land somewhere on the building.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.860
But there's a good chance you'll just smack into the wall if you do that,

14:04.740 --> 14:06.580
rather than, say, break through a window.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.300
Because there is fundamentally a lot more wall than window.

14:09.940 --> 14:13.060
Or you might be able to ditch the snowdrift if you're lucky

14:13.060 --> 14:14.580
and you can find one deep enough.

14:14.580 --> 14:17.620
You did say, since we had walked out to that tower,

14:17.620 --> 14:18.820
a few feet had fallen, right?

14:19.220 --> 14:21.460
Checkers was no longer able to see our footprints.

14:22.660 --> 14:26.340
Was I knee-high in snow, walking out there?

14:26.340 --> 14:27.780
Yeah, it was pretty much that.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.700
And it's probably got deeper since then.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.540
Keep in mind, I have a size 40.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.060
On the other hand, you do know that there are quite a lot of cars parked outside.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.700
So if you just plummeted in the wrong place,

14:39.700 --> 14:43.380
you might end up having a rather hard landing.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.740
Then here's what I'd like to do.

14:44.740 --> 14:50.100
I would like to look for the tallest, fluffiest pine tree around here.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.860
Presumably it's got, you know...

14:51.860 --> 14:54.580
Oh, Montpelier pines are so fluffy.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.100
They're so fluffy.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.260
Especially when they're snow covered.

14:58.260 --> 14:58.760
Exactly.

14:59.380 --> 15:02.100
And I just kind of want to hug that bad boy.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.820
I just want to like, I'm going to turn the engine off

15:04.820 --> 15:10.660
and drift into a tree and try to hug it down.

15:11.380 --> 15:14.340
That word drift is doing an awful lot of heavy lifting.

15:16.900 --> 15:21.780
Because fundamentally, you're switching off the one thing that is keeping you up in the air.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.660
And yeah, there are high winds.

15:24.660 --> 15:29.940
Well, I see Scott, I didn't succeed in a pilot role when I tried to control it.

15:29.940 --> 15:32.180
So I thought, what if I just don't?

15:33.060 --> 15:34.260
Uncontrol it.

15:34.260 --> 15:39.220
What we're hoping for here is like a Buzz Lightyear situation where he's not flying,

15:40.180 --> 15:42.260
but falling with grace, or style.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.900
I think this still comes down to a pushed piloting role here.

15:46.900 --> 15:47.400
Awesome.

15:48.020 --> 15:54.420
I mean, you know, if you succeed on this, you're going to land in your tree as you want.

15:54.980 --> 15:57.060
If not, you're going to land somewhere else.

15:59.540 --> 16:00.500
Fair enough.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.780
How does pushed roles work?

16:01.780 --> 16:03.460
You just roll it again on pilot.

16:04.100 --> 16:05.460
And you can't spend luck on this.

16:06.740 --> 16:07.380
Sixteen.

16:08.020 --> 16:08.520
Yes!

16:10.820 --> 16:12.020
Oh my God.

16:13.140 --> 16:17.620
Starman, waiting in the sky.

16:24.260 --> 16:29.380
As Lafayette glides gently into the tree and softly hugs it on the way down,

16:30.020 --> 16:32.900
he just thinks about his kick-ass jetpack and he says,

16:32.900 --> 16:35.700
this is going to blow Cicero's mind.

16:37.380 --> 16:45.700
So yes, I mean, the way that this has ended up is you've managed to grab hold of a branch

16:45.700 --> 16:50.900
sticking out from a fairly large pine tree and you've shaken all the snow off it.

16:50.900 --> 16:54.420
And it is bending nicely and easing you down a bit.

16:55.140 --> 17:01.300
You can see that you're still a bit off the ground, but there is the roof of one of the

17:01.300 --> 17:04.980
outbuildings that you might be able to drop onto as an intermediate point.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.460
He says, tonight I will play the Santa Claus.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.780
And he lands on the roof.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.980
And he yells, parkour!

17:12.980 --> 17:14.740
You utilized that last branch.

17:15.940 --> 17:21.460
So you land on there and immediately send a flurry of snow falling off the roof.

17:21.460 --> 17:24.340
You slide down a bit on some of the tiles.

17:24.340 --> 17:28.580
It's not too heavily sloped and managed to just catch yourself in the guttering.

17:29.460 --> 17:33.860
And that's the point at which you realize that you're not alone on the roof.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.580
The flying pig!

17:38.660 --> 17:46.020
There is something you can just make out this shape through the snow, this twisted dark

17:46.020 --> 17:52.180
thing that you can just catch glimpses of it every now and then as the wind shifts,

17:52.820 --> 17:54.260
but it's moving.

17:54.260 --> 17:55.540
It's scuttling.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.180
That's the word.

17:56.180 --> 17:59.060
It's scuttling across the roof.

17:59.060 --> 18:03.780
And you can see that it is leaving a trail of blood behind it in the snow.

18:05.140 --> 18:09.220
And then it stops for a moment as you hit the guttering.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.700
And at that point it seems to have noticed you.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.580
And it is now scuttling in your direction.

18:14.580 --> 18:17.220
Is this the building that everybody, all the...

18:17.860 --> 18:18.420
The potty?

18:19.060 --> 18:20.820
Yeah, is this a chauffeur party building?

18:20.820 --> 18:21.940
It probably is.

18:22.740 --> 18:23.860
You'd guess, maybe.

18:23.860 --> 18:27.220
Someone outside yells, this is a great chauffeur party building!

18:28.260 --> 18:28.740
I just...

18:28.820 --> 18:32.500
Lafayette is terrified.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.660
And he lets go of the gutter.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.860
He just wants to drop and get away from this thing.

18:37.860 --> 18:41.060
And he wants to then run into the chauffeur's party.

18:41.780 --> 18:46.820
First thing, let's have a sand roll as you see this thing scuttling towards you.

18:48.340 --> 18:53.700
His head looks all wrong and it looks like it's pulsating there in the gloom.

18:53.700 --> 18:58.260
There's there's crenellations and ridges all over his head that are just throbbing.

18:58.340 --> 19:01.940
And things sticking out, sharp things.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.860
He hates it.

19:03.860 --> 19:07.620
He is not down with this, but he passes his sand roll.

19:07.620 --> 19:12.820
And he's like, I'm sorry to drop out so soon, old chap.

19:12.820 --> 19:15.700
But well, and then he lets go.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.100
Okay, give me a jump roll to have a graceful landing.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.980
I don't think I have much of that.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.940
Oh, that is a base plan.

19:23.940 --> 19:24.500
What, 20?

19:26.340 --> 19:27.380
Oh, 100.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.140
Wait, what is zero, zero, zero, zero?

19:29.140 --> 19:30.100
That's a hundred.

19:30.100 --> 19:30.820
Oh my God.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.100
That's a hundred.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.140
So I think, so I think what happens.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.140
Your bones go into your brain and you're dead.

19:38.020 --> 19:44.580
You try to leap off the roof, but the cuff of your trousers gets caught in the guttering.

19:44.580 --> 19:48.180
And you leap off and suddenly, I mean, you're there hanging by one leg,

19:48.180 --> 19:51.140
swinging backwards and forwards like a screaming pendulum

19:51.140 --> 19:55.860
as this thing scuttles across the roof towards you and looks down at you.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.380
We'll come back to you in a moment.

19:59.380 --> 20:00.820
Oh my God.

20:03.780 --> 20:07.140
I will say the moment you said scuttles, I got goosebumps.

20:09.140 --> 20:11.060
I wonder if that thing has too many legs.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.900
That thing has two legs.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.540
I wish it had none.

20:20.100 --> 20:29.700
So, meanwhile, Checkers and Harvey had just finished climbing down the slippery,

20:29.700 --> 20:36.020
now slightly blood splattered ladder and made it down to, I guess, the comparative safety

20:36.020 --> 20:36.580
of the ground.

20:37.140 --> 20:41.700
Yeah, as we get into the ground, I get down there and then I help Harvey down the last

20:41.700 --> 20:47.540
few steps and I've got like quite a bit of blood on my face from it dripping down from you.

20:48.420 --> 20:48.920
Yeah.

20:49.380 --> 20:53.220
And your boss flew off.

20:53.220 --> 20:54.180
Did you see which way he went?

20:54.180 --> 20:56.100
We've got to catch up to him.

20:56.100 --> 21:02.820
Would the light from, I feel like maybe the completely engulfed in flames tower light

21:03.940 --> 21:09.140
have like illuminate the area enough for us to look around and see?

21:09.140 --> 21:13.620
The way the buildings are laid out, he's on the other side at the moment.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.460
So you wouldn't be able to see him from where you are.

21:15.460 --> 21:18.980
But if you start moving up towards the main building, you could probably see him fairly

21:18.980 --> 21:19.700
easily.

21:19.700 --> 21:26.340
I think when I was climbing down, I think I saw him fly off that way towards the buildings.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.340
Then let's head that direction then.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.100
We got to catch up with the boss.

21:30.100 --> 21:31.220
How's your arm?

21:31.220 --> 21:33.860
Can we try to maybe fix that?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.380
It's bleeding pretty bad.

21:35.380 --> 21:40.180
I tore my sleeve off here and I put it down there on the last little accent.

21:41.140 --> 21:41.620
Put it down there.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.340
I put it on the cut.

21:44.340 --> 21:46.420
I'm going to try to do a first aid on him.

21:46.420 --> 21:53.220
In addition to the first aid, I'm going to use my resourceful talent to have some antiseptic

21:53.220 --> 21:54.580
and bandages on me.

21:54.580 --> 21:54.900
Okay.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.500
So spend the 10 points of luck.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.220
Okay.

21:57.220 --> 21:58.740
That puts me at 22.

21:58.740 --> 22:02.020
So okay.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.540
Someone's not getting out of this alive.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.140
35 on a 50 first aid.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.820
So yeah, you managed to patch that up.

22:09.060 --> 22:14.500
You are helped as well by the comparatively bright light of the burning tower above your

22:14.500 --> 22:14.740
head.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.180
Perfect.

22:16.180 --> 22:23.380
However, there is this nasty cracking creaking sound from the burning timbers above you.

22:23.380 --> 22:30.020
And there are little bits of burning debris that are beginning to fall down like Satan's

22:30.020 --> 22:31.140
own hell stones.

22:33.460 --> 22:37.780
I pour the like hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol that I have on you.

22:37.780 --> 22:42.660
I bandage your arm up and then I like tenderly like put my hands around your arm and I look

22:42.660 --> 22:46.740
at you and say, you can take the last branch for that.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.180
Now let's run.

22:48.980 --> 22:49.860
I owe you one, buddy.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.540
That feels so much better.

22:51.540 --> 22:52.580
What was that voice?

22:52.580 --> 22:53.540
Oh shit.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.620
I owe you one, buddy.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.140
That feels so much better.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.060
He's just excited.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.020
I owe you one, buddy.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.220
It's so much better feeling now.

23:01.220 --> 23:01.620
Thanks.

23:02.260 --> 23:02.660
Fuck.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.700
Just remember, uh, the last branch helped you.

23:05.700 --> 23:08.660
Now let's run that way and hope that we don't get crushed.

23:08.660 --> 23:12.740
Yeah, we're taking off running and I I'm kind of trusting him at this point to just know

23:12.740 --> 23:14.420
where, what he's doing to get out of there.

23:14.420 --> 23:14.580
Yeah.

23:14.580 --> 23:20.900
I mean, running might be an overstatement for how you're going to try not to fall down.

23:20.900 --> 23:26.820
But yeah, you, you Trump your way through the snow and there are larger and larger bits

23:26.820 --> 23:30.580
falling off the burning tower now smacking into the snow around you.

23:31.300 --> 23:37.780
And as you make your way into the courtyard, the courtyard, I'll tell you what, give me

23:37.780 --> 23:38.100
a spot.

23:38.100 --> 23:38.660
Hit and roll.

23:39.300 --> 23:39.780
Both of us.

23:40.580 --> 23:40.900
Yeah.

23:42.580 --> 23:42.900
Fuck.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.380
I got an 84 on a 70.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.980
I got a 78 on a 40.

23:47.940 --> 23:54.420
Then yeah, you, you, you obliviously walk past the house where the party's going on

23:54.420 --> 23:56.580
and just miss the swinging form of Lafayette.

23:57.540 --> 23:58.580
Holy shit.

24:01.380 --> 24:06.980
I was really counting on that.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.580
It's a snow whip around.

24:08.580 --> 24:14.500
As they like run out of the area, like where they would be smashed by the tower, Checkers

24:14.500 --> 24:18.740
turns around and is just kind of like walking backwards through the snow, like looking at

24:18.740 --> 24:21.700
the tower as it's like collapsing on itself.

24:21.700 --> 24:26.180
So oblivious, pretty good distraction, oblivious to everything else around him.

24:26.180 --> 24:31.220
Well, and so obviously from that angle, my silhouette would be perfectly illuminated

24:31.220 --> 24:31.860
as he turns around.

24:31.860 --> 24:35.220
I was about to say, if you want to use that as the basis for a pushed.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.540
Yes, I do want to use that as a basis for a push.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.500
And that is a 51 on a 40.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.940
Can we both push it?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.860
Can I push it for the same reason too, right?

24:46.660 --> 24:47.540
Did Harvey look at all?

24:48.660 --> 24:53.220
Why not be hilarious to have you both fail at the same time?

24:53.220 --> 24:56.180
I pass my 25 on a 70.

24:56.180 --> 25:02.740
Just through the shrill, like shriek of the wind, you hear like, Harvey, Harvey.

25:02.740 --> 25:06.820
And like a dog hearing its name, I shoot my head around, pointed right at it.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.740
Well, I was about to say, you see a few different things.

25:10.740 --> 25:14.980
So, you know, I mean, they're in the light from the burning tower and also from the light

25:14.980 --> 25:19.940
coming out of the house where, or the outbuilding rather, where the chauffeurs were having their

25:19.940 --> 25:20.660
little party.

25:21.540 --> 25:27.700
You can just see the outline of Lafayette in his jet pack, swinging backwards and forwards

25:27.700 --> 25:28.820
by one leg.

25:28.820 --> 25:35.380
There is something above him, but you can also see through the windows of the house

25:35.380 --> 25:36.180
behind him.

25:37.140 --> 25:41.300
You can see blood sprayed all over the windows.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.140
And yeah, I mean, that's the point at which you cat's eye to the thing that is scuttling

25:49.140 --> 25:51.380
down over Lafayette.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.220
Do you want to give me a sand roll for all this?

25:58.260 --> 26:01.060
That's a super duper pass, a three on a 60.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.300
Okay, so you don't lose any sand for that.

26:03.300 --> 26:10.420
So you're in a position to act, but Checkers, having failed that push, I think you're standing

26:10.420 --> 26:15.140
there as well, looking back at this tower and it's beautiful, isn't it?

26:15.140 --> 26:17.620
Just the way the fire is burning there.

26:18.340 --> 26:22.340
Steam is coming off of it as the snow falls down into the fire.

26:23.380 --> 26:24.340
Oh, it's gorgeous.

26:24.340 --> 26:26.900
I mean, it's almost transfixing, isn't it?

26:26.900 --> 26:32.100
And it's really easy to stand there just for that moment too long as some of the larger

26:32.100 --> 26:34.500
timbers start falling down in your direction.

26:34.500 --> 26:34.740
Right.

26:34.740 --> 26:38.660
And it's almost as if every single one of my senses is focused on this.

26:38.660 --> 26:42.180
The only thing I can hear is the crackling of the fire in the wood.

26:42.180 --> 26:46.420
The only thing I can see is the beauty of the tower on fire.

26:46.420 --> 26:51.460
I stick my tongue out and snow falls on it and I'm like, that tastes cold.

26:52.020 --> 26:53.700
But what I'm looking at is hot.

26:54.660 --> 26:59.940
And I feel the warmth from the fire as it radiates off the tower.

27:01.060 --> 27:05.140
But the tower at this stage and the strong winds is rocking backwards and forwards.

27:05.140 --> 27:11.460
And as you stand there looking at it, you can see it's moving and it's toppling and

27:11.460 --> 27:15.620
it's toppling and Jesus Christ, it's coming straight for you.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.620
Oh my God.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.260
Is it going to hit the creature?

27:20.260 --> 27:25.140
What is my sense of like, if I didn't move right now, would it fall right on me?

27:26.100 --> 27:28.100
I mean, if you want to stand there, we try to work it out.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.260
You did fail a push-draw, right?

27:34.260 --> 27:38.980
I'm going to say that I'm pretty freaking transfixed on this thing and it's hard to

27:38.980 --> 27:40.660
move around in this snow, so.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.540
All right, so you're not going to try to dodge out of the way.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.980
You're just going to stand there and let it hit you.

27:44.980 --> 27:50.580
I'm going to continue moving backwards at the same pace I was, but there's like no

27:50.580 --> 27:53.380
sense of urgency in my movements.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.580
So you're not trying to dodge it?

27:55.300 --> 27:55.620
No.

27:55.620 --> 27:59.460
Yeah, really make a point about how you're not trying to dodge the huge tower coming

27:59.460 --> 28:02.020
down on you when you don't have enough luck to stay alive.

28:02.020 --> 28:04.500
Yeah, maybe without all your luck, it'll still Buster King you.

28:04.500 --> 28:08.740
Maybe once it gets close to me, it might snap me out of my way.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.260
Oh yeah, maybe you should dodge.

28:10.260 --> 28:14.340
From the point it starts falling, there isn't going to be a hell of a lot of time before

28:14.340 --> 28:15.700
it's actually on you.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.420
How about this?

28:16.420 --> 28:18.820
Yeah, I won't dodge because I just failed my dodge roll.

28:21.300 --> 28:21.800
Okay.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.740
So yeah, no attempt made.

28:24.740 --> 28:25.460
By how much?

28:26.020 --> 28:27.220
51 out of 25.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.060
Oh fuck.

28:29.060 --> 28:29.780
I could.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.060
Yeah, spend it all.

28:31.060 --> 28:32.020
Or could I push?

28:32.820 --> 28:33.700
But then I might die.

28:34.420 --> 28:38.820
Yeah, you can't really push this because this is a, you know, it's not an action you

28:38.820 --> 28:39.940
can really retry.

28:39.940 --> 28:42.900
Um, do I have enough luck to, I don't think I do.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.220
Uh, 22.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.100
22.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.500
You failed by 26.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.380
So now I can't.

28:49.380 --> 28:49.880
Yeah.

28:50.980 --> 28:56.980
Okay, well then these burning timbers just start crashing all around you.

28:57.620 --> 29:03.060
The structure atop the tower falls off to one side and explodes in a shower of sparks.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.980
The timbers though are falling hard and heavy around you.

29:07.540 --> 29:11.380
And one of them does hit you because you don't manage to get out of the way.

29:12.100 --> 29:13.620
And you take.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.020
Oh, that face.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.620
My health plus five damage.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.460
You take, you take 11 hit points of damage.

29:25.940 --> 29:30.260
Or wax into you and, and it drives you into the snow drift.

29:30.260 --> 29:34.660
You are simultaneously freezing and burning at the same time.

29:35.460 --> 29:42.980
Oh, that drops me down considerably, but I'm not stunned or anything.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.540
Is it more than half your hit points?

29:45.540 --> 29:49.700
Almost very almost 23 or 24.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.100
I had 24 and that was 11 damage, right?

29:52.900 --> 29:53.300
Okay.

29:53.300 --> 29:53.860
Okay.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.580
So yeah, I'm down to 13.

29:56.580 --> 30:01.620
But you are at least partially pinned under this burning timber.

30:01.620 --> 30:04.020
So it's like a huge plank of wood.

30:04.020 --> 30:09.940
Basically, yeah, one of the, one of the struts that was supporting the tower is broken up

30:09.940 --> 30:14.500
into pieces because of the fire, but this is a fairly big pole or whatever that, that

30:14.500 --> 30:15.300
has landed on you.

30:16.020 --> 30:20.020
I mean, the good news is that you have a very strong man.

30:23.060 --> 30:25.700
The bad news is I think he might be preoccupied.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.900
Well, what I want to do if I'm able to.

30:30.180 --> 30:30.820
Harvey!

30:31.780 --> 30:32.260
Fuck it.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.140
Harvey!

30:33.140 --> 30:33.620
Harvey!

30:33.620 --> 30:34.100
Help me!

30:35.940 --> 30:39.700
And I'm assuming Lafayette shouting pretty much the same thing at the same time.

30:39.700 --> 30:43.140
Can I do like a charm roll to charm Harvey into helping me?

30:46.020 --> 30:50.420
I want to do a fast talk roll to talk faster and get more Harveys out.

30:50.420 --> 30:50.580
Okay.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.460
I'm going to, can I charm his fast talk?

30:53.460 --> 30:57.140
Do you want to make an opposed roll to see which one of you is making the more compelling

30:57.140 --> 30:57.460
arc?

30:57.460 --> 30:57.620
Yeah.

30:59.940 --> 31:01.620
68 on an 80 fast talk.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.380
Ooh, you win 25 on a, on an 80.

31:05.380 --> 31:05.780
Harvey!

31:05.780 --> 31:06.100
Harvey!

31:06.100 --> 31:06.500
Harvey!

31:06.500 --> 31:07.860
I'm asking you very quickly.

31:07.860 --> 31:08.660
I think he wins.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.060
Yeah.

31:09.060 --> 31:09.940
Oh wait, this is lower?

31:09.940 --> 31:10.180
Yeah.

31:10.180 --> 31:10.580
Yeah.

31:10.580 --> 31:11.780
Lower is good in this game.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.900
Oh, it's good in this game.

31:12.900 --> 31:15.460
It's the hard success versus just a regular success.

31:15.460 --> 31:16.660
Then, uh, fuck that.

31:16.660 --> 31:20.180
I mean, I mean, I mean, it is still obviously, yeah.

31:20.740 --> 31:22.980
Up to you, Harvey, which one do you follow?

31:22.980 --> 31:28.340
But it certainly sounds like from, from the cries that are reaching you, it sounds like

31:28.340 --> 31:29.780
checkers is far more in need.

31:29.780 --> 31:31.060
Harvey, look at your arm!

31:31.620 --> 31:35.060
And help me!

31:37.380 --> 31:40.580
How far off the ground is Lafayette compared to us?

31:40.580 --> 31:46.260
He's probably only about five or six feet off the ground, but it's just, it's just the

31:46.260 --> 31:52.980
fact that he's hanging by an ankle while this creature is starting to crawl over him.

31:52.980 --> 31:53.540
Oh shit.

31:53.540 --> 31:57.380
If he's that close to the ground, I think Harvey's instinct would be to help his boss

31:57.380 --> 32:01.460
by trying to just grab his ankle and pull it off the scaffolding.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.900
Do you at least give like a caring look toward...

32:04.900 --> 32:05.700
Well, that's what I'm saying.

32:05.700 --> 32:07.140
I didn't realize he was that close to the ground.

32:07.140 --> 32:08.500
I think I can try and do both.

32:09.140 --> 32:12.740
I mean, you could do both if they weren't like 20 feet apart.

32:13.860 --> 32:17.380
It's just moving backwards and forwards between them through the heavy snow is going to take

32:17.380 --> 32:18.500
such a long time.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.100
You can't help both of them.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.380
Harvey, your arm!

32:21.380 --> 32:22.100
I helped you!

32:22.660 --> 32:23.220
Help me!

32:23.780 --> 32:28.180
And if he's that far away, I'm going to, I'm going to, I think, turn to the guy who's yelling

32:28.180 --> 32:33.140
at me closest to me right now and I'm going to, I want to rip the other sleeve off of

32:33.140 --> 32:40.660
my other arm and I want to create like oven mitts now that I've got a fiery thing I got

32:40.660 --> 32:43.140
to pull off a guy and yeah, I want to try and move it off of him.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.540
And you're going to try to lift this large burning...

32:45.540 --> 32:49.780
Could I like roll to help him by like pushing...

32:49.780 --> 32:50.820
You certainly can.

32:50.820 --> 32:54.740
Yeah, I mean, if you give me a strength roll and if it's a pass, you can give them a, it

32:54.740 --> 32:56.740
will take the difficulty level down by one.

32:56.740 --> 32:57.220
Cool.

32:57.220 --> 32:57.540
Okay.

32:57.540 --> 33:01.540
I got a 25 on a 60 for my strength roll.

33:02.660 --> 33:05.140
So that's going to be a straight strength roll for Harvey.

33:05.140 --> 33:05.780
No!

33:05.780 --> 33:06.980
I, uh, I fail it.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.260
It's a 97 on a 90.

33:08.260 --> 33:10.980
So I'm going to use seven luck to just make it a success.

33:10.980 --> 33:11.300
Nice.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.980
Oh, thank goodness.

33:12.980 --> 33:17.460
So yeah, you managed to, I mean, luckily using your, your oven mitts, you managed to avoid

33:17.460 --> 33:18.980
burning your hands too much.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.980
And yeah, it's, I mean, it's difficult at first.

33:20.980 --> 33:23.380
This is a really big, heavy timber.

33:23.380 --> 33:25.060
And I mean, it's on fire.

33:25.060 --> 33:27.300
It doesn't open up at all.

33:27.300 --> 33:31.780
But somehow, yeah, you put in almost a superhuman amount of strength.

33:32.500 --> 33:32.740
Yeah.

33:32.740 --> 33:35.780
I mean, it's obviously down to the great first aid that checkers gave you.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.060
You wouldn't have stood a chance.

33:39.620 --> 33:39.940
Yeah.

33:39.940 --> 33:43.380
So like we were, as I'm like pushing up and he's lifting up.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.660
Come on buddy, push!

33:44.660 --> 33:45.780
Push with all your might!

33:45.780 --> 33:50.340
I'm barely able to, like with the, the snow is melting underneath the fire.

33:50.340 --> 33:55.220
It's melted just enough that I can slide right out and we drop the, drop the log.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.340
And, and, and will you drop your log?

33:58.340 --> 34:01.460
Let's, let's go to Lafayette and see whether you still have a boss.

34:03.380 --> 34:04.180
Yeah.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.340
Well, Lafayette doesn't know if he still has a Harvey.

34:06.340 --> 34:10.340
He sees him go to help him and he's like, he's almost as pissed as he was at Morden.

34:11.220 --> 34:12.260
You can have my guy.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.220
We'll just switch guys.

34:16.020 --> 34:20.500
I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.

34:20.500 --> 34:23.220
Your guy is weird.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.180
The old guy is weird.

34:27.540 --> 34:27.860
Okay.

34:28.580 --> 34:28.740
Yeah.

34:28.740 --> 34:35.940
I mean, there you are swinging by your, your trouser calf off this, uh, off this gutter.

34:35.940 --> 34:42.740
And this creature now has, has crawled down and is beginning to move its way down your body.

34:43.460 --> 34:49.620
You can see his hideous misshapen head pulsing in the light that's coming from the windows

34:49.620 --> 34:50.900
and from the burning structure.

34:51.780 --> 34:55.220
Lafayette ignites the jet pack and tries to push off.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.900
And he hopes that breaks the thread on his trousers.

34:58.900 --> 35:02.180
So are you, if you're hanging upside down, there's a chance that this,

35:02.180 --> 35:04.180
no, I'm going to try to push off as I do it.

35:04.180 --> 35:07.780
But I thought you were trying to burn the creature sideways.

35:07.780 --> 35:08.280
Oh yeah.

35:08.820 --> 35:12.500
I think there's many things that can be happening all at once here.

35:13.140 --> 35:15.700
Well, do you want to give me a piloting role then?

35:15.700 --> 35:18.020
I think if it's a regular success, you're pushing away.

35:18.020 --> 35:20.420
And if it's a hard success, you can try igniting the creature.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.140
Oh, piloting.

35:21.140 --> 35:21.380
Yeah.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.660
I have a 55 in that.

35:22.660 --> 35:28.660
So it was, it was, it was, it was 35, 35, 35, two, two.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.460
You rolled a two.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.020
I rolled a two.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.780
Oh my God.

35:33.780 --> 35:35.540
Extreme success.

35:35.540 --> 35:38.420
Like a jet pack fart in the face.

35:38.420 --> 35:43.940
And as you're pushing off and taking off, it seems to be trying to take off after you,

35:43.940 --> 35:48.660
but yeah, your jet catches it straight on and you can see fire engulf it.

35:48.660 --> 35:53.060
And yeah, just a sizzling sound as it falls down to the snow and twitches there.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.140
Happy new year chap.

35:57.140 --> 36:01.940
And I do a flip in the air and land next to Harvey and checkers.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.180
Fuck yes.

36:04.740 --> 36:09.140
And I think that's a good point to cut back to Mr. Ring.

36:09.140 --> 36:12.180
Hello, bright light in the, in the wardrobe.

36:12.180 --> 36:18.100
I, I've lost three of my best friends recently and I'm looking for a new master.

36:18.100 --> 36:23.140
I think along with the three of your best friends, let's see whether you've lost any

36:23.140 --> 36:28.340
San for all this, because this is a lot that's going on at the moment.

36:28.340 --> 36:29.460
It's a lot.

36:29.460 --> 36:30.660
54 on a 90.

36:31.220 --> 36:31.700
Okay.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.540
You still lose one point of San.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.100
Okay.

36:34.340 --> 36:35.940
Cause he accidentally popped ahead.

36:35.940 --> 36:41.620
So we got to, he croquered ahead.

36:42.740 --> 36:46.580
I do want to luck roll as well, just to see whether you've been injured by any of the

36:46.580 --> 36:48.340
bits of flying cranium.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.220
Oh, that's a fail.

36:49.220 --> 36:49.780
93.

36:50.900 --> 36:51.380
Okay.

36:51.380 --> 36:53.300
He created a frag grenade skull.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.740
Think of the infection you're going to get from that.

36:59.460 --> 37:00.740
That's three points of damage.

37:00.820 --> 37:04.740
So yeah, I mean, you can feel a sting in your, your cheek.

37:04.740 --> 37:09.460
And, and as, as you reach up, you can feel that there's something hard stuck in your

37:09.460 --> 37:09.940
cheek.

37:09.940 --> 37:16.260
My beautiful face has been tainted forever by me being the psychic conduit for the, the

37:16.260 --> 37:20.420
cattywampus game of a croquet that's been played through my mind.

37:23.940 --> 37:27.460
And yeah, I mean, if you, if you pull this, this loose, you can see that it's a bit of

37:27.460 --> 37:30.180
a high socket and there's, there's a bit of a high in it as well.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.660
Oh my God.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.020
Embedded into your face.

37:34.020 --> 37:35.540
Now you've got an actual third eye.

37:35.540 --> 37:36.260
So it works out.

37:38.820 --> 37:44.980
The physical realm, the physical realm is not nothing in the physical, nothing in the

37:44.980 --> 37:46.260
physical realm can hurt me.

37:49.140 --> 37:51.380
Margaret Payne has liked it at this stage.

37:51.380 --> 37:56.420
And how many legs, how many legs did she do it?

37:56.420 --> 38:04.420
You can hear this buzzing from inside the wardrobe, or at least very deep inside the

38:04.420 --> 38:08.020
wardrobe, it sounds like, which again just goes, release me.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.900
How would I do that, my new friend?

38:10.900 --> 38:14.900
I mean, there's, there's no direct response to that.

38:14.900 --> 38:20.180
Yeah, well, you get the impression from the acoustics that that voice is coming from

38:20.180 --> 38:21.540
quite some distance away.

38:21.540 --> 38:25.060
The powers that possess the world help those who help themselves.

38:25.780 --> 38:30.580
All right, well, I will be on my way then.

38:30.580 --> 38:32.500
Bright light in the wardrobe.

38:32.500 --> 38:32.980
Really?

38:32.980 --> 38:33.940
You're not going to do it?

38:34.580 --> 38:35.060
Do what?

38:35.620 --> 38:36.660
Open the wardrobe?

38:37.220 --> 38:38.580
It is already open.

38:38.580 --> 38:39.540
The wardrobe's open.

38:39.540 --> 38:41.540
I mean, you can already see the light coming out of it.

38:41.540 --> 38:41.860
Yeah.

38:41.860 --> 38:46.820
I'm not, I don't feel, it did not tell me to step into it nor reach into it nor throw

38:46.820 --> 38:48.100
any body into it.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.540
So what if Narnia is back there?

38:49.540 --> 38:49.780
Yeah.

38:52.340 --> 38:53.060
Grew up, Christian.

38:53.060 --> 38:53.460
You love that.

38:55.780 --> 38:59.140
All right, so did Elden Ring, actually.

38:59.140 --> 39:01.300
He's a PK from Kentucky.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.260
A preacher's kid?

39:02.900 --> 39:05.540
Yeah, he's a preacher's kid from Kentucky.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.060
Is that what you say on the boards?

39:08.900 --> 39:11.220
Yeah, when we're talking about all of our religious trauma.

39:13.700 --> 39:17.460
So, so does that mean you're not investigating the wardrobe or you are?

39:17.460 --> 39:21.140
Well, I'd like to if, if it would give me any sort of direction.

39:21.140 --> 39:23.700
I am one who follows direction well.

39:23.700 --> 39:27.700
You can hear when the voice is coming from somewhere deep within the wardrobe.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.260
Are you there, my dear master, sir?

39:30.260 --> 39:33.140
Are you saying that in the conversational tone or are you shouting?

39:33.140 --> 39:38.740
He's reaching his head towards the light to kind of like poke its head in to say it.

39:38.740 --> 39:42.020
Yeah, I mean, I mean, as you look into the water, go into the water, you can see that

39:42.020 --> 39:48.180
what it is is there's a false door or secret door in the back of it that seems to go to

39:48.180 --> 39:50.180
a staircase that's leading down.

39:50.180 --> 39:56.980
I'm no lion as I am not strong in physical strength, but I can be a witch.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.940
And he walks into the wardrobe.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.900
C.S. Lewis.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.940
There are these wooden steps leading down.

40:05.940 --> 40:10.260
There's a fair bit of light coming from down below and you can hear this.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.140
Oh, it's my voice breaking up again.

40:13.140 --> 40:14.260
I just got good.

40:14.260 --> 40:16.820
I'm just like getting fucked, man.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.700
I'm just like ready for it.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.260
I'll say that again to make it easier for you to edit.

40:22.260 --> 40:22.980
Appreciate you.

40:22.980 --> 40:24.100
Yeah, you head down.

40:24.100 --> 40:26.660
There's a set of wooden stairs that are going down.

40:26.660 --> 40:30.740
There's brick lined walls and you can see light coming from down below.

40:30.740 --> 40:34.740
And there's this rattling sound as well, sound like metal rattling.

40:34.740 --> 40:41.220
And this this buzzing voice again saying, Releasing.

40:41.220 --> 40:42.500
Yes, OK, I hear you.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.540
Calm down.

40:43.540 --> 40:44.260
I'm so sorry.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.340
You seem very perturbed by this whole situation.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.940
May I ask you a few questions?

40:49.940 --> 40:50.980
Who is that?

40:50.980 --> 40:53.060
That is that is not Mordant.

40:53.780 --> 40:54.740
Who are you?

40:54.740 --> 40:56.660
No, we destroyed Mordant together.

41:00.260 --> 41:01.620
There's a pause there.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.300
Mordant is dead?

41:03.300 --> 41:04.260
Well, yes, of course.

41:04.820 --> 41:07.860
Through the power invested in me from you.

41:08.900 --> 41:09.220
Good.

41:10.180 --> 41:11.940
Then you must release me.

41:11.940 --> 41:12.580
Yeah, all right.

41:14.660 --> 41:15.540
Okie dokie.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.180
Yeah, sure.

41:16.180 --> 41:23.620
OK, and as you make your way to the bottom of the stairs, you can see that it opens up

41:23.620 --> 41:30.500
into what looks like a laboratory or a workshop of some kind, that there are workbenches

41:30.500 --> 41:35.700
with all sorts of strange equipment and kind of half-finished devices, inventions.

41:35.700 --> 41:37.220
You know, you're not quite sure.

41:37.860 --> 41:43.300
There's a big freestanding, what looks like electrical loom that's got all sorts of

41:43.300 --> 41:44.580
strange wiring on it.

41:45.940 --> 41:52.260
But the thing that attracts your attention the most is in the center of the room, you

41:52.260 --> 41:57.540
bolted to the floor is something that looks almost like a medieval torture device made

41:57.540 --> 41:58.500
of black iron.

41:59.860 --> 42:03.140
And there is something that is bolted within it.

42:03.940 --> 42:13.460
This strange, twisted, insectile-like thing, it has too many legs and it has claws and

42:13.460 --> 42:18.980
pincers and things sticking out of its head and its head is pulsating.

42:18.980 --> 42:20.340
You can't see any eyes.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.460
You can't even really see anything you can identify as a mouth.

42:26.580 --> 42:28.340
Do you want to give me a SAN roll?

42:28.340 --> 42:28.840
Yeah.

42:29.560 --> 42:30.060
I do.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.440
That's 11 on an 89.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.160
Yes, yeah.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.840
Somehow you're taking this in your stride.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.560
Okay, all right.

42:39.560 --> 42:45.320
Hello there, future bug master and overlord, perhaps.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.560
I have a question for you.

42:47.560 --> 42:56.440
I'm a very passionate voter and so I would like to know what platforms you are interested

42:56.440 --> 43:02.360
in paying attention to if you are going to take over humanity, which is just an assumption

43:02.360 --> 43:04.120
is my thought of your goal.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.640
I have no interest in taking over your pitiful species.

43:08.360 --> 43:11.560
Release me now and you shall be spared it.

43:11.560 --> 43:16.360
So does that involve the killing of the rest of the people like me?

43:16.360 --> 43:18.600
Only those who get in my way.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.200
And what is the end goal?

43:20.200 --> 43:22.360
My goal is to be released.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.600
Well, sure, for now that's short term.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.600
What is your long term goal, please, mister?

43:30.600 --> 43:35.320
There is this long pause as it is trying to process what the fuck you're saying.

43:36.520 --> 43:39.640
It's rattling this iron cage that it's stuck in.

43:39.640 --> 43:43.720
The other thing you can see now that you're a bit closer in talking to this is that it

43:43.720 --> 43:45.720
looks really badly hurt.

43:45.720 --> 43:48.120
A few of its limbs seem to be broken.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.360
There are wounds all over its carapace.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.960
It looks like it has wings, but the wings look damaged.

43:54.440 --> 44:02.680
But the worst of all is, yeah, this sort of brainy looking head that it's got covered

44:02.680 --> 44:07.480
in crenellations has got holes in it.

44:07.480 --> 44:10.440
It looks like holes have been drilled into its head.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.600
And you can see crusted around some of the holes, this sort of yellowish pus.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.520
Oh, my God.

44:18.520 --> 44:23.000
Hey, I was just wondering, you seem to be in pretty bad shape.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.480
Do you think that that would make you any less...

44:25.480 --> 44:27.640
Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!

44:31.240 --> 44:34.360
You can try to psychic attack it by your means.

44:36.680 --> 44:37.880
Oh, fucking shit.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.560
71 on a 90.

44:39.560 --> 44:40.600
Normal success.

44:40.600 --> 44:43.400
Oh, yeah, that's an extreme success on this path.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.520
So what happens if your opponent bests you?

44:49.160 --> 44:49.560
Sorry?

44:49.560 --> 44:52.760
So what happens if your opponent bests you at this contest?

44:53.080 --> 44:59.960
Psychic powers, psychic attack, allowing heroes to use psychic attack.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.920
Is this a monster or a mythos monster?

45:03.560 --> 45:04.760
It's a mythos monster.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.560
Psychic attacks do not work on mythos monsters.

45:13.160 --> 45:17.960
So not only have you failed on basic terms, but they wouldn't have worked even if you

45:17.960 --> 45:18.680
succeeded.

45:18.680 --> 45:23.960
The minds of mythos monsters are so alien that to connect with them is to risk losing

45:23.960 --> 45:25.640
one's own mind.

45:25.640 --> 45:30.840
A human attempting to psychically attack a mythos monster must immediately make a sanity

45:30.840 --> 45:35.720
roll, taking the standard sanity loss as described in the monster's profile.

45:35.720 --> 45:40.120
So it means that you could take the same sanity roll twice for seeing them and then trying

45:40.120 --> 45:40.680
to connection.

45:41.000 --> 45:49.400
Then you get all these impressions as you dig into its mind of just darkness and these

45:49.400 --> 45:57.480
strange alien minds and moving through interstellar space and flying just through space, through

45:57.480 --> 46:01.320
all these places that the angles don't quite work right.

46:01.320 --> 46:04.360
I rolled a 94 on an 89.

46:04.360 --> 46:12.280
Oh, and you lose six points of sand.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.160
Do you want to give me an intelligence roll?

46:20.760 --> 46:23.320
Oh, 28 pass on a 50.

46:23.320 --> 46:24.440
It's probably bad for you.

46:25.640 --> 46:28.040
The good news is to get five points of Cthulhu mythos.

46:28.040 --> 46:31.880
The bad news is you're having a battle of madness and you're having one where there

46:31.880 --> 46:33.320
are no other player characters around.

46:34.680 --> 46:36.280
Summary rules for that.

46:36.280 --> 46:41.160
So let's just draw a curtain on what happens here and we'll come back to you shortly to

46:41.160 --> 46:42.760
see what's happened.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.800
Hey, Scott, thank you.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.720
I'm really happy right now.

46:49.720 --> 46:57.640
I like that we learned in real time that what you did was a horrible decision to think back

46:57.640 --> 47:01.640
on how much glee we had when you shouted psychic attack and the way that it ended up.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.720
Whoops, you've gone mad.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.200
And so you're just repeatedly trying to psychic attack.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.120
Oh God.

47:12.120 --> 47:14.360
Now, meanwhile, back out in the courtyard.

47:15.000 --> 47:22.600
Yeah, there's there's bits of burning debris all around now, which are lighting the courtyard

47:23.240 --> 47:24.440
quite nicely.

47:24.440 --> 47:30.280
And you can see that there are more of these flying creatures, some of them moving through

47:30.280 --> 47:30.680
the air.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.920
Some have landed on the roofs.

47:32.920 --> 47:39.320
You can see some scuttling in through windows on the manor house and the air around you

47:39.320 --> 47:40.120
is buzzing.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.440
Holy shit.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.480
Well, I don't know about you fellas, but I think we ought to get up there and kill that

47:47.480 --> 47:49.800
thing in the wardrobe in the bedroom.

47:53.800 --> 47:59.720
OK, now that I've been rescued from underneath the burning log and I've got burns and shit

47:59.720 --> 48:02.120
all over me and I've seen this crazy shit.

48:02.680 --> 48:09.480
I immediately start to miss Eldon and I'm like, yeah, he actually believes in the shit

48:09.480 --> 48:12.280
that I was trying to peddle and it's happening now.

48:13.160 --> 48:13.480
Fuck.

48:14.120 --> 48:19.640
And he's just going to run towards the entrance of the main house to try to go find Eldon.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.080
Harvey's just going to turn to Lafayette.

48:21.080 --> 48:23.000
Hey, boss, I think it's time we get out of here.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I think that's a capital idea, Harvey.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.160
Do you think we could get one of these cars going?

48:28.120 --> 48:31.240
I don't think any of these cars are moving into some of the snow melts.

48:31.240 --> 48:35.240
I think our best bet is to seek refuge inside, maybe find the wine cellar.

48:35.240 --> 48:41.320
As Checkers is running off, he's like, don't you want to show your that the scientist how

48:41.320 --> 48:42.600
much better you are than him?

48:44.600 --> 48:48.040
You know, perhaps tomorrow when things have calmed down, but there are an awful lot of,

48:49.080 --> 48:51.000
you know, demons in the air.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.560
Demons in the air.

48:58.120 --> 49:01.960
Yeah, I'm following Lafayette's lead no matter what, but I think we're aiming for the house.

49:01.960 --> 49:04.520
I mean, we're running after you all the same.

49:05.560 --> 49:08.120
So, yeah, you make your way as quickly as you can through the snow.

49:08.920 --> 49:12.440
Actually, each of you could give me a spot hidden roll on your way past if you want.

49:13.240 --> 49:13.880
Ought 7.

49:14.440 --> 49:15.000
25.

49:15.000 --> 49:15.560
OK.

49:15.560 --> 49:17.240
A 14 on a 70.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.640
That's the extreme, extreme success.

49:19.640 --> 49:24.280
You all notice as you're going past, at least parts of the cars that are parked outside

49:25.240 --> 49:28.200
seem to be relatively cleared of snow.

49:28.200 --> 49:32.440
In fact, it mostly seems to be the fronts of the cars.

49:32.440 --> 49:38.200
Now you look at it, the hoods are open and there are bits of engine just strewn all over

49:38.200 --> 49:39.000
the place.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.280
Oh, shit.

49:40.280 --> 49:43.080
Looks like snow is the least of our troubles with these autos, Harvey.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.560
Yeah, we ain't going anywhere in any of these.

49:45.560 --> 49:46.120
Eldon!

49:48.840 --> 49:53.800
So, yeah, I mean, you make your way towards the house and as you get in through the main

49:53.800 --> 50:00.680
doors, you can see coming down the stairs at the far end of the hallway, there's a few

50:00.680 --> 50:02.600
of the staff who stopped and just looking.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.720
There's Margaret Payne.

50:05.080 --> 50:11.320
She's walking fairly slowly down the stairs and she is absolutely covered in blood with

50:11.320 --> 50:12.680
grey specks on her.

50:13.720 --> 50:20.360
She's got a thousand yard stare in her eyes and she's just swaying as she's coming

50:20.360 --> 50:20.680
down.

50:21.240 --> 50:24.280
Ms. Payne, have you seen Eldon?

50:25.720 --> 50:26.920
He killed Cicero.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.920
He killed Cicero.

50:28.920 --> 50:29.800
He killed...

50:29.800 --> 50:30.360
Where?

50:30.360 --> 50:31.560
He did what?

50:31.560 --> 50:35.960
She just points upstairs and then just faints dead away and bounces down the rest of the

50:35.960 --> 50:36.520
stairs.

50:36.520 --> 50:37.320
Oh, shit.

50:37.320 --> 50:42.680
Lafayette is bounding up the stairs where she pointed three at a time.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.040
Checkers is following after him.

50:44.040 --> 50:44.760
Same with Harvey.

50:44.760 --> 50:48.440
He's like, maybe he's not dead yet and he can see my jet pack before.

50:48.920 --> 50:54.920
It's the last thing he sees as I hold his hand and I'm like, look, look, Cicero.

50:56.920 --> 50:59.320
And then he's gone and then I piss on his bed.

51:03.320 --> 51:09.400
As he's dying, he looks up to you with a tear in his eyes and he's like, you were better.

51:12.040 --> 51:15.240
Yeah, he says this with no eyeballs and no head.

51:15.960 --> 51:19.160
This is all in Lafayette's imagination as he's running up the stairs.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.680
He says, I never hated you.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.200
I just loved your wife.

51:24.440 --> 51:31.160
It's the look in the eye that's still embedded in Mr. Ring's cheek.

51:34.520 --> 51:38.200
I'm shouting Eldon's name as I'm running up the stairs too.

51:38.200 --> 51:38.760
Do it.

51:38.760 --> 51:43.560
I mean, yeah, you can see that there's light coming down from the end of the corridor and

51:43.560 --> 51:48.040
probably more importantly, there is a trail of bloody footprints coming down the corridor

51:48.040 --> 51:49.720
from this room at the end.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.960
Yeah, that's what Checkers is going to be following.

51:51.960 --> 51:57.480
You get in there and I mean, as bad as the wallpaper in this room probably looked before,

51:57.480 --> 51:58.760
it looks a lot worse now.

52:00.200 --> 52:06.280
There is blood and brain and bits of skin and bone just splattered around the place

52:06.280 --> 52:15.880
like pebble dash, the almost headless body of Cicero leaking blood into the carpet.

52:15.880 --> 52:21.400
And from down below you can hear this heavy clanking sound and something heavy falling

52:21.400 --> 52:30.360
over and this buzzing voice saying, yes, yes, you shall be spared, you shall be spared,

52:30.360 --> 52:31.480
you and you alone.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.240
Checkers runs towards that.

52:35.240 --> 52:43.080
Lafayette dips his finger in some of the blood on the wallpaper and takes a lick and he knows.

52:43.080 --> 52:44.120
He knows it's Cicero.

52:46.600 --> 52:47.400
It's cold.

52:47.400 --> 52:53.400
He sits down for a moment next to the corpse on the bed and he doesn't really know what

52:53.400 --> 52:54.120
to do with his life.

52:56.120 --> 53:02.520
I mean, there is still this bottle of strange yellowish liquid there and a hypodermic syringe

53:03.080 --> 53:03.560
as well.

53:07.400 --> 53:09.480
Yeah, this is rock bottom.

53:09.480 --> 53:10.680
I should probably start injecting.

53:13.000 --> 53:19.400
Scott's just like, well, here we go.

53:19.400 --> 53:20.600
Having a rough night?

53:25.640 --> 53:27.240
The next logical step for you.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.480
Harvey standing over Morden's body.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.480
Well, this is good news, right?

53:33.480 --> 53:35.480
This is the kind of the end game here, right?

53:35.480 --> 53:36.760
You win.

53:36.760 --> 53:37.160
You won.

53:37.160 --> 53:37.880
You won.

53:37.880 --> 53:38.760
Harvey, don't you see?

53:38.760 --> 53:42.280
I wanted to rub his nose in it and now he doesn't have one.

53:42.280 --> 53:42.920
Well, you can do that.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.480
Here, look.

53:44.840 --> 53:47.000
And I start to rub his skull.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.240
Rubbing his nose in it.

53:49.240 --> 53:49.800
That's lovely.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.480
That's the half of a skull.

53:52.680 --> 53:57.320
So it's just Checkers who's running downstairs and the other two of you are commiserating

53:57.320 --> 53:59.800
over Morden's corpse upstairs.

53:59.800 --> 54:00.920
Yeah, you've got this, right, Checkers?

54:01.640 --> 54:03.400
Oh, I've never been more ready.

54:04.360 --> 54:05.720
We'll start moseying on down there.

54:06.280 --> 54:14.760
You run downstairs and there is this horrible buzzing sound, the sound like the one you

54:14.760 --> 54:15.560
heard outside.

54:15.560 --> 54:22.280
And sure enough, when you come around the corner, there is this battered form of this

54:22.280 --> 54:29.320
creature like the one you saw outside or the ones you saw outside that is beginning to

54:29.320 --> 54:35.640
rise off the ground and there on the ground before it, kneeling almost in reverence,

54:36.200 --> 54:38.280
is the form of Mr.

54:38.280 --> 54:38.600
Ring.

54:39.560 --> 54:39.880
Mr.

54:39.880 --> 54:46.040
Ring is coming back to his senses now, I guess, but how this has affected you, how this

54:46.040 --> 54:50.360
glimpse of seeing something so much greater than yourself is shaping your thoughts at

54:50.360 --> 54:52.040
the moment is entirely up to you.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.440
Is this thing still inside the cage?

54:54.440 --> 54:54.680
No.

54:55.480 --> 54:56.040
No, Mr.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.360
Ring seems to have just finished freeing it.

54:58.360 --> 55:02.600
I'm going to use my resourcefulness, so I'm going to take 10 points.

55:02.600 --> 55:08.600
And I have a gun on me and I'm going to shoot this thing because it scares me.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.160
So, yeah, I mean, Mr.

55:11.160 --> 55:16.440
Ring, you can see that Checkers, your old master, is that right?

55:16.440 --> 55:18.040
Or is he still your current master?

55:18.040 --> 55:22.280
I mean, does he still have anything to teach you compared to the wonders you've just seen

55:22.280 --> 55:23.800
inside this creature's mind?

55:23.800 --> 55:24.440
Good point.

55:24.440 --> 55:29.400
I have been completely transformed by the darkness that is now within me.

55:29.960 --> 55:36.840
It has completely tainted my soul, and I will now be known as Dark Soul.

55:47.240 --> 55:48.440
Oh, my God.

55:50.440 --> 55:50.760
Wow.

55:52.760 --> 55:53.960
I love it so much.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.000
Oh, my God.

56:00.600 --> 56:03.320
Then, yeah, Mr.

56:03.320 --> 56:14.760
Soul can see Checkers pulling out this gun as this divine creature is beginning to rise

56:14.760 --> 56:15.480
up in the air.

56:16.360 --> 56:17.720
What's everyone doing?

56:18.040 --> 56:20.760
Checkers is just going to unload his gun.

56:20.760 --> 56:29.160
And while he's screaming like, Elden, Elden, my name is no longer chosen to be Elden Ring.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.680
You were once my friend and my mentor.

56:38.360 --> 56:42.280
So you're just firing wildly into this thing as fast as the gun will shoot.

56:42.840 --> 56:43.240
Exactly.

56:43.240 --> 56:45.160
Yeah, it's going to be point blank range.

56:45.160 --> 56:49.480
So this will be three normal firearm handguns rolls.

56:50.040 --> 56:58.040
FAIL 85 on a 50, 36 on a 50, 19 on a 50.

56:58.040 --> 57:02.920
Don't bother rolling damage on this because guns aren't very effective.

57:04.520 --> 57:14.360
So, yeah, I mean, the bullets whack into it and I mean, they make holes and the thing

57:14.360 --> 57:16.040
seems angry.

57:16.040 --> 57:24.280
You can hear the timbre of its buzzing getting louder and the buzzing voice just fills

57:24.280 --> 57:30.120
the room, even over the deafening effect of the gunshots.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.560
And Mr.

57:31.560 --> 57:35.560
Soul can hear it just saying, Destroy him.

57:37.960 --> 57:41.320
Well, obviously, after some time to get...

57:41.320 --> 57:43.560
Taking attacks, taking attacks, taking attacks!

57:44.920 --> 57:53.080
As I finish unloading or like just shooting three bullets off at this thing, I feel the

57:53.080 --> 57:55.880
same feeling that I got downstairs in the ballroom.

57:55.880 --> 57:57.400
The feeling that broke your heart.

57:59.000 --> 57:59.640
60.

57:59.640 --> 58:00.360
44.

58:00.360 --> 58:00.840
Fuck you.

58:03.720 --> 58:08.520
I see the lack of effect that my bullets have made on this thing.

58:09.480 --> 58:15.240
And I look at Eldin and I change the aim of my gun because I can feel him attacking me

58:15.240 --> 58:16.760
again psychically.

58:17.560 --> 58:21.160
And I fire a single bullet towards Eldin.

58:22.120 --> 58:22.600
Wow.

58:22.600 --> 58:28.920
OK, while you're doing this, the creature is just flying through the air past you to

58:28.920 --> 58:29.960
go up the stairs.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.520
Oh, OK.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.160
Not at me.

58:32.120 --> 58:35.560
It's quite happy to leave you two downstairs to kill each other while it escapes.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.120
Pretty good plan on its part.

58:39.080 --> 58:41.240
It's not stupid.

58:42.680 --> 58:44.280
We've got personal shit we're working out.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.640
So you were going to shoot Mr.

58:49.640 --> 58:49.960
Soul?

58:50.920 --> 58:53.000
Hopefully not, but I'm going to shoot at him.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.360
You'll get a bonus die as well because it's point blank range.

58:56.360 --> 58:57.160
Oh, perfect.

58:58.840 --> 59:02.920
Well, that's a 31 and also a 31 again.

59:02.920 --> 59:06.680
So I successfully shoot him.

59:09.160 --> 59:11.080
So what kind of gun is this?

59:11.080 --> 59:16.040
Just like a small handgun, like a 38.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.560
Yeah, like a 38 special.

59:17.560 --> 59:20.120
OK, so roll a D10 damage.

59:23.320 --> 59:23.800
10.

59:27.800 --> 59:31.480
OK, so yeah, there is this searing pain.

59:32.840 --> 59:38.200
Your friend, your confidant, your leader, the man who defined your life.

59:38.200 --> 59:41.640
Defined your beliefs, defined your existence until a moment ago.

59:41.640 --> 59:42.760
A man named Checkers.

59:45.640 --> 59:48.120
A man named Checkers.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.480
Yes, Checkers has betrayed you.

59:52.520 --> 59:54.040
But only because you betrayed me.

59:54.840 --> 59:55.480
That's fair enough.

59:55.480 --> 59:58.440
I went from 21 to 11 hit points.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.800
Oh yeah, I mean, does the physical pain hurt more,

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.720
or is it more the emotional pain of having been shot by your mentor?

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.560
Well, obviously physical pain can't.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.440
Oh, I just got shot.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.960
Yes, physical pain hurts more.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.800
And as soon as I shoot him, I drop the gun and I'm like, why?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.080
Why would you do that?

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.800
You've shot him in the abdomen.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.440
If you're lucky, maybe not in the gut, in the stomach,

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.360
but there's blood welling out from between his fingers now.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.000
I definitely am going to immediately try to first aid him.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.320
Is Mr. Soul putting up with that?

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.520
You've just been shot and now he's trying to tend to your wound.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:40.860
Why?

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.360
Why did you not join on the true side of...

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.400
You got tricked.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.240
They got to you.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.080
I thought you were stronger than that.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.680
But we seek the universe and its power.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.000
Well, on my way down, you don't know any of this,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.680
but on my way down the ladder, I thought about just whatever you're into,

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:02.520
I was going to do.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.840
But then you tried to mind attack me again.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.200
You son of a bitch.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:12.200
And then he starts pouring the hydrogen peroxide on his open wound on his stomach.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.400
Oh, there is a fine line between first aid and torture.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.120
Well, I'm trying to do a little column A, a little column B.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.920
Do you want to give me a first aid roll?

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:26.540
Yes.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.280
54 on a 50.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:31.880
I have four luck.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.840
Oh, I'll spend four luck to make that pass.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.560
Okay.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.400
Which puts me at eight.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:45.080
So you can have a D4 hit points back as somehow having hydrogen peroxide

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.560
poured in a gunshot wound does you the world of good.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.760
Well, yeah, it's that.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.960
And then once it's kind of done fizzing up, I get some gauze and just put it in the hole.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.240
It was like 70% hydrogen peroxide, so it dissolves the bullet.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:03.400
Uh, I'm back up to 13 now.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.920
Former master checkers.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.000
What was that thing that you were talking to?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.040
That it wanted to be free and it wants to, I didn't quite understand, but it's powerful.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.160
He's just like jaw on the floor, like mouth open, like does not understand what in the

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.320
past 20 minutes what's happened to his friend.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.400
Like he's just like shaking his head.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.360
Like what the fuck?

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:38.200
I've seen things on the others tonight that are so powerful.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.160
More than you can imagine.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:49.880
And while Mr. Soul bears his soul to checkers, let's cut upstairs.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:56.840
Harvey and Lafayette can hear this buzzing sound from down below.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.960
Then there's gunshots.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.920
They're shouting.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:06.760
The buzzing sound is getting louder and louder as something comes bursting out of the wardrobe.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.080
Something very much like the things you saw outside.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.960
But this time you're now seeing it in bright light.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:21.960
You can see the twisted insectile form, the strange pincers, the pulsating head, the strange

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.160
wounds all over it as it floats above the ground.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.120
Do you want to give me sand rolls first of all?

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.720
Oh shit, I fail a 68 on a 60.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.720
Can you, can you luck a sanity roll?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.360
You cannot.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:37.400
Okay.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.760
Can you lick a sanity roll?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.560
How many licks in the center of a sanity roll?

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.320
I believe I passed.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.000
Let me get my sheet back up.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.720
Oh nope.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.000
93 on an 89.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.320
I fail.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:48.760
Okay.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.880
So you both failed.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.760
So Lafayette loses.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:59.640
Oh, he only loses one point of sand and Harvey loses five points.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.440
That's more like it.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.120
Can I have an intelligence roll off Harvey, please?

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.480
Yes, you can.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.360
That's a 44 on a 60.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:11.480
Okay.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.320
So you're having a bad madness as well.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.400
So again, you get five points of Cthulhu Mythos.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.440
What do you think of them?

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.240
Blind panic?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.360
Does that sound about right?

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.320
Yeah, totally.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.120
So yeah, I mean in your panic to get out of the room, you're pushing Lafayette out of

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:26.840
the way.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.280
The two of you are just stumbling all over each other and this creature actually doesn't

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.800
seem to be paying you much attention.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.640
It just flies out of the room at speed.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.760
From beyond in the corridor and down the stairs, you can hear sounds.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.800
I mean, you heard a few sounds before, glass breaking and stuff like that.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.840
But now there are other sounds.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:05:00.120
There are people screaming and there's strange sounds like electrical discharge and just

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.360
this buzzing, so much buzzing in the air, not just this thing that flew past you.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.280
But it's just like suddenly the air is absolutely filled with buzzing.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.280
Oh my God, it's a swarm.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.000
And shall we leave the episode here?

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.380
Yes.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120
Yeah, holy shit.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:26.840
So we're going to be able to clean it all up and have a good ending by the next episode.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.760
Yeah, it should be a pretty clean ending.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.260
Fine.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.480
The light in that tower was actually like a bug zapper that we destroyed.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.520
It wasn't a zapper, it was going to draw them in like moths.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.720
Oh my God.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.080
There would have been thousands more.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.400
But they would have been over there.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.720
Yeah, they would have been over there.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.480
It's totally what it is.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.160
It's going to change the world, you know?

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:06.280
A body could be hollow before its blood ran cold

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:20.760
I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and faggot bone

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:28.760
You were hollow when you spoke to me

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.240
Hollow when you sang

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.400
I thought you might be starving

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:52.040
So I gave you everything

01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:00.040
Thorns and rocks and devils glow

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.040
Brides and dry-baked clay

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:10.040
Crocus blossoms in February

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.560
And I lay home in May

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.040
Time between a mother's fingers

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.160
And spit off of a bridge

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.600
Restless legs at 3pm

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.680
While waiting for a fix

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:19.160
So come back here and see what's left of me

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:29.160
Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.880
My voice is nothing now

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.920
But the howl of the wind

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.440
Come closer dear in my teeth

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.920
Rattle in my jaw

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.480
Come closer dear in my teeth

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.920
Rattle in my jaw
