0	7020	Hola, que pasa mis perros, esta es Wolf the dog.
7020	12200	On this week's edition of Howlin' with Wolf, we got ourselves a beautiful poem written
12200	16960	by a listener who gave us a five-star review on iTunes.
16960	20220	That was a super cool thing to do, listener.
20220	23780	She writes, My dearest Samuel,
23780	29260	You are the ying to my yang, The chicken tendies to my basement dweller,
29260	35520	The window to my wall, The sweat that drips down my balls,
35520	41920	You really butter my bread and stain my bits, I love you even if you keep taking weird pictures
41920	51360	of my paddle-board feet, Wow, that is so fuckin' gross,
51360	55020	Sorry y'all, Wolf is just jealous of all this love,
55020	61940	It gives me wet in the eye-holes, Now, wholesome news,
61940	68860	Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use.
68860	73780	This is the cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of
73780	76420	a missing person.
76420	82220	The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals.
82220	87640	The names of the deceased are not yet being released, my babies.
87640	93260	More importantly, however, the officers of law here in contention eat the most awful
93260	95260	breakfast food.
95260	101700	The officers are also dealing with the situation wherein Officer Bishop seems to be in more
101700	104080	than one place at a time.
104080	106700	He has no recollection of this.
106700	113300	Then, a lot of super important plot stuff happens, involving the FBI agents, the black
113300	120280	Nike bag, a small silver sphere, and things of that nature.
120280	126260	It seems like our boys at the local precinct might be getting called up to the big show.
126260	135600	For all our listeners in Springfield, Missouri, contentions greatest band, Kudzu, will be
135600	141380	playing in a show March 2nd at some place called the Front of House Lounge.
141380	146880	In honor of this actual event, we are premiering a brand new song by Kudzu.
146880	151580	It is No Backbone.
176880	187720	Okay, so in order to dig into these characters a bit more, we're going to take a look into
187720	190640	the past, starting with Clark Bishop.
190640	191640	Howdy.
191640	197280	I have Joe with me here today, and we are joined by a long-time Delta Green player and
197280	201760	my favorite person in existence, Taylor, my wife.
201760	202760	That's me.
202760	203760	And...
203760	204760	Borat.
204760	205760	My wife!
205760	206760	Nailed it.
206760	211360	I'd prefer you not do that.
211360	213920	So let's go ahead and get right into it.
213920	221520	Let's flash back to a time when Clark Bishop was a much, much younger man.
221520	223680	One might even call him a boy.
223680	226840	Yeah, and then I'll put in that in post.
226840	231340	It'll be like the nice dream sequence.
231340	237580	So you are in your childhood home, which just so happens to be, if I'm not mistaken,
237580	240620	to be the home that Clark Bishop still lives in.
240620	244620	Do you want to give a quick description of what it looks like back then?
244620	247160	Yeah, it's real clean.
247160	251820	It's one of those houses that keeps the plastic on the couch.
251820	256940	Lots of angel wings and crosses on the walls.
256940	258940	Maybe a framed picture of Jesus.
258940	259940	Jesus.
260620	261620	Is it tatting?
261620	264140	The little doilies and things on armchairs?
264140	266580	Yeah, your chairs have tats.
266580	267580	Yeah.
267580	268580	Tatted.
268580	269580	Yeah.
269580	270580	Awesome.
270580	271580	Yeah.
271580	277000	So as you're going about your normal kid time, I don't know what you're doing, but your parents
277000	279020	are in the kitchen making dinner.
279020	287860	Pat Sajak is loud and clear over the television, and as you're playing in the living room,
287860	294980	you hear your mom yell from the kitchen, Kermit the Frog in my throat.
294980	299700	And your dad is like, oh, it was right there.
299700	300940	I had the frog in my throat.
300940	303580	I couldn't come up with the Kermit.
303580	309620	And they're jawing back and forth, and you're looking over on the walls, you got all the
309620	314860	pictures of the Jesus, the crosses, you got some angels.
314860	319660	I don't know, maybe like a family picture of you guys on vacation somewhere.
319660	324460	And your mom walks over as your dad keeps working on dinner.
324460	330940	And she leans down to you, Clark, and she kind of like looks at the TV as Wheel of Fortune
330940	336220	goes into its final clue in the bonus round.
336220	341820	And she says, Clark, life is like the bonus round.
341820	344620	We were already given the best letters.
344620	349860	Then she gives you a big old hug and a kiss on the forehead and says, are you off to the
349860	350860	library?
350860	351860	Yeah, of course.
351860	358700	You're going to go say hi to Mr. Fingerson.
358700	359700	Mr. Fingerson?
359700	360700	Yeah, of course.
360700	362700	Yeah, go say hi to Mr. Fingerson.
362700	365180	Tell him that we send our guards and oh, also.
365180	371780	And she goes and grabs a little basket of muffins, lemon poppy seed muffins.
371780	373340	Yeah, they're good.
373340	375300	I bet he would enjoy these.
375300	376300	Mr. Fingerson?
376300	381540	He loves muffins.
381540	387580	So off we see little Clark Bishop riding a bike, maybe, or contentions in small town.
387580	388940	You could easily ride your bike.
388940	390000	Yeah, totally a bike.
390000	393380	To the contention public library.
393380	398020	When you go in there, you would see it's dead.
398020	399020	It's dead.
399020	400020	It's a really nice place.
400020	404380	The general's a little musty in here.
404380	410940	The library is not frequented often by the general population of contention.
410940	418180	However, you do see that at the information desk, Mr. Fingerson is having a conversation
418180	421740	with a man that I think you would recognize.
421740	426420	His name is Gary Daley and he runs the Pho Shop in town.
426420	431700	He is having a very loud conversation with Mr. Fingerson.
431700	436100	Uh, yeah, no, I really like this one for sure.
436100	439260	The true and horrifying confessions of the St. Oscyth witches.
439260	440540	Yes, of course.
440540	448260	If you have anything of this elaborate nature, something so esoteric, like this is the kind
448260	450780	of stuff that is right up my alley.
450780	452580	Oh, yes, Mr. Daley.
452580	454620	We have quite a bit in the occult.
454620	457500	I can surely gather some materials for you.
457500	460340	Tell me, what are you going to be reading these for?
460340	464880	Oh, I am just perusing them because I enjoy the story.
464880	466740	See nothing, I don't know.
466740	471660	It's just life is a little bit too bland and I like spicing it up.
471660	473200	I completely agree.
473200	474300	Often I feel in contention.
474300	476260	I don't feel fulfilled.
476260	483060	Perhaps if I had made better decisions in my younger life, I would be a greater man.
483100	489420	Jerry Daley walks away with his book and kind of denotes where he's going to be sitting.
489420	490420	Like, huh?
490420	491900	Well, I'm going to be right over here.
491900	494300	Oh, Clark, thank goodness you're here.
494300	495300	Hey, Mr. Fingerson.
495300	497300	Oh, please call me Gerald.
497300	498300	All right, Gerald.
498300	499300	No, no, no.
499300	500300	Good sir.
500300	501300	It is Gerald.
501300	502300	Oh, of course.
502300	505420	Extend that short O.
505420	509940	I always mess that up, Mr. Gerald.
509940	510940	That's very close.
510940	512920	We'll keep working on it.
512920	517080	It's only been, what, seven months that we've been practicing?
517080	518560	I'll get there one day, I'm sure.
518560	519720	Oh, I'm sure you will.
519720	520720	And what brings you here today?
520720	522040	Well, first of all, here.
522040	523040	My mom made these for you.
523040	525080	Oh my goodness, muffins.
525080	528720	If only I weren't gluten intolerant.
528720	530120	She always forgets, doesn't she?
530120	531120	Yes, she sure does.
531120	532840	I keep telling her you like muffins.
532840	533840	That's probably why.
533840	536040	I'll put these with the other batches.
543920	553520	So we see Clark and Gerald walking through the stacks, picking out books, and talking
553520	561640	about life, and then the phone in the contention public library begins to ring.
561640	562640	Ring, ring.
562640	563640	Ring, ring.
563640	564640	Thank you.
564640	567680	I was going to do that in post, but I think we don't need it anymore.
567680	568680	No, we're going to keep that.
568680	569680	No, that's-
569680	571600	And that's going to be the phone sound for the rest of the podcast.
571600	574760	All of the podcasts got that sweet, sweet sample.
574760	575760	You're welcome.
575760	578560	It will be used from here on out.
578560	579560	Yes.
579560	582960	Hello, this is Gerald.
582960	584960	Clark, Clark, get Clark.
584960	585960	Hurry.
585960	587960	Who may I ask is speaking?
587960	588960	Tell him.
588960	591000	Tell him he was already given the best letters.
591000	592000	You have to tell him.
592000	593000	Are we talking about-
593000	599000	Excuse me, are you still there?
602440	605320	He put his heart monitor on the line?
605320	607280	How very strange.
607280	610760	Clark, I believe you got a phone call.
610760	613640	He told you you have the best letters.
613640	617640	I've often liked the spelling of your name as well.
617640	625280	What do you think that means?
625280	628560	He sounded panicked, and then he screamed a little.
628560	632800	So you guys look outside the windows to the outside world.
632800	641560	The sun was still out, you know, late summer, and the sky turns, and it is dark before you
641560	642560	know it.
642560	647880	Like, it is not time for sunset, however, the sun is no longer shining over contention.
647880	650800	Oh, that precarious contention weather.
650800	656760	And you immediately see these figures start moving outside the windows, and you can't
656760	661480	make them out, but something is moving around outside the library.
661480	667600	And you kind of look over, and Gary Daley is just, you know, in his book, oh my, yeah.
667600	673000	You kind of look over, and you see the front doors, and you see this dark figure in the
673000	676400	darkness behind him, shrouded.
676400	684000	He's clearly wearing a cloak, and he is locking the doors of the library with a massive chain,
684320	687120	and he's locking you into the library.
687120	691560	As soon as he finishes, he turns and runs, and out of the windows, you see a bright flash
691560	692560	of light.
692560	695340	What do you guys do?
695340	697520	My God, what is happening?
697520	700440	Mr. Finkerson, did you see that?
700440	701960	Well, I sure did.
701960	703320	Let's go take a look.
703320	708280	Seems something's finally interesting is happening in contention.
708280	710560	Interesting is, I guess, one way to put it.
710560	712080	Yes, don't you worry, Clark.
712080	713840	I'm your mentor.
713840	715440	I will take care of this.
715440	716440	Okay.
716440	720440	And I go and stand very behind Mr. Finkerson.
720440	723080	All right, Mr. Finkerson.
723080	724240	All right.
724240	727920	So I go over and take a peek out of one of the windows.
727920	728920	Okay.
728920	731160	When you go over and take a peek out of the windows, I'm picturing...
731160	734720	Oh, also, real quick, what does Mr. Finkerson look like?
734720	740360	He looks like, let me try to think of a celebrity comparison.
740360	743160	Oh, we don't do that.
743160	744280	We don't do that here.
744280	746080	We don't do that here.
746080	749660	That's what all the other actual play podcasts do.
749660	756280	So we'd like to give a quick physical description using two to three descriptive words.
756280	758960	Okay, two to three, that's all I get?
758960	759960	Yeah.
759960	760960	Okay.
760960	761960	Sweater vest.
761960	764960	All right, you already used two.
764960	773080	No, that's a hyphenated word, if not just one complete word.
773080	782800	And if I only get one other word, bifocals, I was going to say like low on the bridge
782800	783800	of my nose.
783800	784800	Okay.
784800	785800	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
785800	787280	A sweater vest and bifocals that are low on the bridge of my nose.
787280	793560	He's also only 19, it's a weird choice in the voice.
793560	795480	As you look out the window...
795480	797600	Sweater vest but no shirt underneath.
797600	799600	Oh, that's a good look.
799600	803320	They tat it up.
803320	806040	Tribal tattoos going all the way down.
806040	809040	The glasses aren't even real, they're just like for to be trendy.
809040	810680	Are they transitions?
810680	813200	Oh, of course they are.
813200	816480	So we see, what's your fucking name?
816480	817480	Gerald.
817480	818480	Gerald.
818480	820480	I said it wrong.
820480	821480	Gerald.
821480	822480	Gerald.
822480	827280	So we see Gerald Fingersen looking out, creeping along and looking out this window and a young
827280	835320	Clark kind of peeking out from behind him and this massive, massive shadow moves right
835320	839520	out of frame and you actually see this man.
839520	846940	He's a very tall man wearing a black suit and he is sprinting away and following him
846940	855500	is this completely cloaked figure who is running after him into the darkness of the night.
855500	856720	That's happening outside the windows?
856720	857720	That's happening outside the window.
857720	860560	And it would have previously been like 2pm or something?
860560	866000	It would have previously been like 5.30pm, maybe even 6.
866000	867440	Do I recognize the man in the suit?
867440	868440	No.
868440	869680	Mr. Fingersen, do you know who that was?
869680	873040	I sure don't and there's only a population of...
873040	876000	Insert whatever you think the population of contention is.
876000	877760	I don't think we've ever talked about it.
877760	879600	So let's not.
879600	882200	We might need a whole lot more at some point.
882200	884560	Yeah, probably small.
885560	887200	Okay, how about this?
887200	892200	I do not, however, I only ever interact with people at the library, so it's pretty much
892200	895520	just you and now Mr. Daley.
895520	900520	Just geographically, would that guy have been, should he have been running from the library
900520	903000	or could he have been coming from somewhere else?
903000	904000	Geographically?
904000	905000	Mm-hmm.
905000	907440	Oh, they were coming from the library.
907440	910680	It looks like they ran through the wall and popped out the other side.
910680	912680	No, not quite.
912680	913680	No.
913800	915240	No, they're just running away from the library.
915240	916240	Okay.
916240	917240	But how far would you say they are?
917240	918240	20 yards.
918240	919240	Okay.
919240	920240	And then...
920240	921240	Take a shot, Mr. Fingersen, take a shot.
921240	925040	I pull out a big rifle.
925040	929040	They aren't even serpentining.
929040	933360	Dear boy, I'd like you to get behind the reference center.
933360	936800	I do believe I'm going to try to interact with them.
936800	938680	And then I go try to open a window.
938680	945920	When you open up the window, light actually comes back into the world and both figures
945920	950440	that you saw running away are no longer within sight.
950440	956160	However, based on how fast they were running and how far away they were and the flatness
956160	961800	of the land, you should still be able to see them, but you no longer can.
961800	964480	Okay, I'm going to go see if the lock is still on the door.
964480	965580	It is.
965580	966640	But it's lighter out now?
966640	967640	Yeah.
967640	969120	It's normal, but there's a lock on the door.
969120	976000	Clark pops his head up from behind the reference desk where he dutifully went and hid and sees
976000	977520	that it's kind of light out.
977520	979400	I want to look at Mr. Daley.
979400	980760	How's he acting?
980760	987600	Mr. Daley is sitting staring at this book and he looks at you and he's like, was there
987600	990940	a big cloud?
990940	993000	Maybe Mr. Daley.
993000	994720	It seemed pretty dark for a cloud though.
994720	995940	That was crazy.
995940	1001340	I've read those occult books frontwards and backwards in my many years alone in the library
1001340	1004420	and I do believe that they have something to do with this.
1004420	1007340	Mr. Daley, I think we must have a sit and talk.
1007340	1009180	Okay, come on down.
1009180	1011180	We go on down.
1011180	1016660	All right, so we see, give me just a second.
1016660	1025940	I was going to do the Georgia booboo beep boop booboo.
1025940	1031400	There was an article that my favorite murder is the most listened to podcast in Missouri.
1031400	1032400	Is it really?
1032400	1033400	How interesting.
1033400	1036840	It's that and cereal and something else that they're all three of the things that my mom
1036840	1037840	listened to.
1037840	1040620	She was like, I'm bumping those numbers up, baby.
1040620	1045700	Well, I've almost finished all of my favorite murder in a short period of time.
1045700	1046700	They're good.
1046700	1048300	I've only listened to a handful, but I've always enjoyed them.
1048300	1053500	All right, well here, I'll show you what I was reading while, uh, when all that went
1053500	1060580	all dark and stuff, I was, I was looking at this page here, it says, uh, and casting her
1060580	1062060	eyes aside.
1062060	1065380	She saw- Mr. Daley, don't say it again.
1065380	1068900	What if it, what if it was the thing that did the thing and then you did it again?
1068900	1073300	Well then I guess it would get dark if you believe in that sort of thing, Clark, but
1073300	1077980	well, you know, you're a young boy, I suppose beliefs aren't that crazy for you.
1077980	1081900	Clark starts to kind of realize that he's being a little wimp and he's like, no, I mean,
1081900	1083940	of course, of course that's not what happened.
1083940	1085940	What are you, a little pussy?
1085940	1086940	Sorry.
1086940	1089460	Mr. Daley, do not talk to my son.
1089460	1094520	I mean my, my friend that way.
1094520	1100960	And casting her eyes aside, she saw a spirit lift up a cloth over lying over a pot looking
1100960	1106320	much like a ferret and it being asked of the examiner why the spirit did look upon
1106320	1108440	her, she said it was hungry.
1108440	1113160	This examiner being asked how she knew the names of Mother Bennet's spirits saith that
1113160	1118120	Tiffin, her spirit, did tell this examiner that she had two spirits and one of them was
1118120	1124680	like a black dog and the other was red like a lion and that their names were Sucken and
1124680	1131160	cleared and sayeth that Sucken did plague Biet's wife unto death and other plague three
1131160	1134160	of his beasts where of two of them died.
1134160	1139160	That voice is incredibly difficult to listen to.
1139160	1142200	Thankfully it's a small character.
1142200	1145960	I don't know what any of that means, but it sounded cool.
1145960	1150280	These spirits of a dog and a lion that made a, I don't think, I don't know if that has
1150280	1152240	anything to do with this, but that's pretty cool.
1152240	1156040	Clark is still trying to put on a brave face, but he is definitely peeking out the window
1156040	1159080	seeing if the sun's blinking out or anything.
1159080	1162920	Oh yeah, it's completely back to normal outside.
1162920	1163920	Nothing out of the ordinary.
1163920	1168880	Perhaps we should bury this deep inside ourselves and never talk about it again until we have
1168880	1169880	another encounter.
1169880	1183520	Yeah, I do think that's a real good idea there, Gerald.
1183520	1188120	Perhaps a formative experience will happen to you that will unveil this again.
1188120	1190480	Gerald, that's a really good point, Clark.
1190480	1196640	I think that if you guys think that this is going to, you know, affect me in some way
1196640	1204080	down the line, then I'm going to trust you older gentlemen.
1204080	1206080	Thank you for calling me a gentleman.
1206080	1207080	Same.
1207080	1209960	I don't know where to go from here.
1209960	1211600	Yeah, I think we're good in the library.
1211600	1212600	Cool.
1212600	1213600	Yeah, I think that was good.
1213600	1214600	I love that.
1214600	1217360	Is that an episode wrap on Taylor?
1217360	1219920	Well, yes, that is a wrap on Taylor.
1219920	1220920	You killed it.
1220920	1221920	I made it.
1221920	1222920	You fucking killed it.
1222920	1235620	Joe, when Clark turns the corner onto the street his house is on, his mind begins to
1235620	1237720	falter.
1237720	1242640	Your mind effectively breaks, shattering into different realities, and these different scenes
1242640	1247040	play out in front of you, but they're constantly changing like a television flipping through
1247040	1248040	the channels.
1248040	1252000	First, you see your house exactly as you know it.
1252000	1253000	Then it's on fire.
1253000	1257520	Next, the house is normal, but there are police officers and vehicles everywhere, and yellow
1257520	1259840	tape surrounds your home.
1259840	1263880	One after another, relentlessly, the scene changes around you.
1263880	1266620	There are a couple black sedans out front.
1266620	1268360	Now everything is normal again.
1268360	1270000	Now it's a wasteland.
1270000	1274000	Your surroundings continue to vacillate as you approach the door of your home.
1274000	1278220	A man in a suit hops out of a black sedan and hollers to get your attention as you open
1278220	1279920	your front door.
1279920	1281680	Inside is quiet.
1281680	1284840	Looking down the hallway, you notice something's off.
1284840	1288920	There are more wall decorations than normal.
1288920	1290520	Your reality breaks again.
1290520	1292960	Everything's back to the way it always has been.
1292960	1297800	You hear the sounds of Wheel of Fortune, but the sound of the wheel spinning just goes
1297800	1303700	and goes and goes, and you hear voices all around you and inside of you.
1303700	1309480	One says, well, we couldn't find the artifact, but we'll have to get the fuck out of here
1309480	1313400	because Karen did her goddamn magic trick again.
1313400	1317520	Your vision flickers back to your unacceptable reality.
1317520	1323960	In the hallway, there are not more pictures of a happy family, or of angels' wings, or
1323960	1325800	of Jesus.
1325800	1330840	Instead, suspended a couple feet off the ground as if they had been halfway quicksanded into
1330840	1338760	the wall, the parents of Clark Bishop, your parents, have become interior design.
1339440	1345480	Their knees jutting out into the hallway, their hands grasping out for life, their faces
1345480	1348920	contorted in anguish and disbelief.
1348920	1350800	A voice snaps you out of it.
1350800	1355460	We the jury, find the defendant and love.
1355460	1362220	You look up and see a cold, vacant woman smiling out from behind the thick, asymmetrical bangs
1362220	1364600	covering one of her eyes.
1364640	1369120	All you can remember about that day is how perfectly normal it all was.
1369120	1372800	How your house looked completely empty.
1372800	1375000	They weren't there anymore.
1375000	1378920	There was very little evidence in the trial, but the words of Anne Love's confession
1378920	1385200	haunt you as you try desperately to remember anything about that abhorrent day.
1385200	1388120	I did it, and I'd do it again.
1394600	1406880	It's X-Files.
1406880	1408480	It's like D&D, but it's like X-Files.
1408480	1414160	That's what I have to say to everybody when I describe this game.
1414160	1415920	I never think to use the X-Files analogy.
1415920	1416920	That's what I always say.
1416920	1417920	It's good.
1417920	1419040	Luke got it from me.
1419320	1423960	Speaking of the X-Files.
1423960	1429640	I always say that it's like true detective, but stupid.
1429640	1430640	Yeah.
1430640	1431640	That's awesome.
1431640	1437400	Wow, it literally sounded like you had a mouthful of vomit or something.
1437400	1438400	Dick.
1438400	1442000	Dude, I wish I had a mouthful of dick right now.
1442000	1445760	Dude, does anybody bring in any dicks to suck this weekend?
1445760	1446760	I think.
1446760	1448720	I think we're gonna suck Alex's dick all weekend.
1448720	1454480	Dude, honestly, I think if we're ever gonna get involved in a once in a lifetime gay orgy,
1454480	1455480	it's this weekend.
1455480	1456480	It's gonna be this weekend.
1456480	1457480	12 dudes.
1457480	1460320	And a lot of them are strangers to me, so I won't feel that embarrassed.
1460320	1461520	I'll never see them again.
1461520	1462520	And it ticks a few boxes.
1462520	1465040	And Alex is leading the party.
1465040	1468240	He's so drunk that he's not verbal again.
1468240	1471940	Alex would never do something like sleep with a stripper at his bachelor party.
1471940	1476440	His last hurrah of being single would be fucking 12 dudes.
1476440	1477440	11.
1477440	1478440	11.
1478440	1482720	Dude, it's gonna be fun and I hope that we all make it.
1482720	1486200	Yeah, I hope none of us drown in Lake of the Ozarks.
1486200	1487200	Yeah, we get arrested.
1487200	1490520	Or, yeah, I hope none of us get dragged by a cop underwater.
1490520	1493200	They slap cuffs on us and throw us in the water.
1493200	1494200	Oops.
1494200	1498800	Did that guy get fired?
1498800	1500280	You have the right to remain splashed.
1500280	1501920	No, like, nothing happened to that cop, right?
1501920	1502920	Nothing happened to that cop.
1502920	1504200	I didn't know this was a real thing.
1504200	1506040	They handcuffed a guy in a lake and he couldn't swim?
1506040	1509680	No, they handcuffed a guy, sat him on the side of the boat, and he fell backwards and
1509680	1510680	drowned.
1510680	1511680	Nobody got him.
1511680	1512680	Holy shit.
1512680	1513680	Holy shit.
1513680	1514680	Yeah, dude.
1514680	1515680	That's a big ol' oopsie.
1515680	1520040	I don't think the cops got disciplined, but the family is suing the fuck out of the city,
1520040	1521040	I'm pretty sure.
1521040	1522040	I mean, it's Keith's shit.
1522040	1523040	Like, straight up.
1523040	1524040	Straight up.
1524040	1525040	Hard.
1525040	1526040	That's us.
1526040	1530320	I want to say that he actually got charged with involuntary manslaughter or something.
1530320	1531320	Was it here?
1531320	1532320	Was it at Lake of the Ozarks?
1532320	1533320	Well, that's just a ticket in Missouri.
1533440	1535440	Yeah, that's not us.
1535440	1536440	Yeah.
1536440	1537440	50 bucks.
1537440	1538440	Duly noted.
1538440	1541640	I didn't mean to accidentally kill him.
1541640	1545880	Okay, give me one more puff and then I'm ready to boot this baby up and start playing my
1545880	1546880	Bean Boy.
1546880	1548440	You ready to boot-skootin' Biggie?
1548440	1550640	Also, I think we're going to...
1550640	1551640	Well, I'm good.
1551640	1553360	Okay, one last puff.
1553360	1554360	Can you do it?
1554360	1555360	Oh my god.
1555360	1556360	That's your third last puff.
1556360	1557360	I know.
1557400	1561280	Okay, so Agent Kennedy looks at you guys and she says,
1561280	1564280	Good luck.
1564280	1569180	And Kennedy and Billy Harrison turn around and walk out of the police station.
1569180	1570180	Before they do that...
1570180	1572960	I think they already did, though, in the last one.
1572960	1573960	They did, yeah.
1573960	1576220	Yeah, that was just, like, getting us back in.
1576220	1577220	Well, shit.
1577220	1580320	I mean, I don't think we just let him leave, though.
1580320	1581460	I'd be like, wait, what the fuck?
1581460	1582460	What is this number?
1582460	1583460	Who are you?
1583460	1584460	What are you talking about?
1584460	1587040	Please fill us in.
1587040	1589600	We're in what?
1589600	1591360	Should we just call the number right now?
1591360	1592960	None of this is helpful so far.
1592960	1597800	You've just added more mystery to our, like, horribly chaotic lives.
1597800	1605360	Yeah, how about you're too stunned by the recent revelations that have been brought
1605360	1607880	to your attention to say anything.
1607880	1611680	Well, but the only revelation brought to our attention is that there was a phone number.
1611680	1613960	She also confirmed that weird shit exists.
1614360	1616840	Yeah, weird shit is happening, but...
1616840	1618920	Yeah, like, super weird shit.
1618920	1625300	Like she is letting you hold onto a Nike bag that makes things disappear, and she was desperately
1625300	1631120	trying to get rid of a small silver sphere, and Billy Harrison, the bald guy from Charles
1631120	1636560	Donovan's trunk, is one of them, and, okay, how about this.
1636560	1646200	On the back of the paper with the phone number, it says, your job is to stop the incursion,
1646200	1652300	minimize exposure, save lives, and cover the whole thing up.
1652300	1657720	But the ink disappears after you read it, and on the other side, the phone number is
1657720	1658720	still there.
1658720	1661520	Okay, so you guys were talking at the end, and maybe I just missed this in the game.
1661520	1664760	Did you really say call this number in 48 hours?
1664760	1665760	With in.
1665760	1666760	With in, yeah.
1666760	1667760	Oh, with in.
1667760	1669080	They are gonna call us in 48 hours if we don't.
1669080	1670080	If we don't call them first.
1670080	1671080	Gotcha.
1671080	1673040	I thought it was call when you've completed.
1673040	1674160	That also.
1674160	1678640	Our job is to stop the incursion, minimize exposure, save lives, and cover the whole
1678640	1681080	thing up to save it from being exposed.
1681080	1683820	Cool, I'm glad you wrote that down.
1683820	1687320	Quick question, is there, when we spend luck, is there any way to get it back, or is this
1687320	1688760	just like our bank?
1688760	1693520	There is a way to get it back, and also, I haven't awarded any of you luck.
1693520	1695720	Have any of us used luck at all?
1695720	1697040	None of you have used.
1697040	1698520	I thought you did once.
1698520	1699520	No, no one.
1699520	1700760	I didn't, because I'm still at 60.
1700760	1703000	No one has used any luck so far.
1703000	1705760	We've rolled on it before, but we haven't spent any for it.
1705760	1706760	Exactly.
1706760	1712480	And so, let's go ahead and change the economy of luck at the beginning of this session.
1712480	1715640	I will award you all five luck.
1715640	1716640	Right now?
1716640	1717640	Yes, right now.
1717640	1719520	You all gain five luck.
1719520	1722520	I'm at 65.
1722920	1726600	That's four away from the cool number.
1726600	1728760	And only a math problem away from 420.
1728760	1732440	Yeah, I was trying to do that in my head when you made that joke.
1732440	1735320	Scott Aukerman wouldn't have it like that.
1735320	1737140	Rob Crockleman.
1737140	1740880	Is that even one, or did you just say syllables and ended it at three?
1740880	1741880	Harg-Barkerman.
1741880	1742880	I said Op-Crockleman.
1742880	1744880	That's not one.
1744880	1745880	No.
1745880	1746880	Nice.
1747440	1753820	So I'm rewarding you this luck for making it this far, I guess, in the plot and also
1753820	1755560	doing the cool stuff you do.
1755560	1762840	Now from here on out, I will say, if I don't award you luck, if you do something cool and
1762840	1767100	you think that you deserve luck, go ahead and call me out and be like, can I get some
1767100	1768100	luck for that?
1768100	1770400	Like a waiter demanding a tip.
1770400	1771400	Exactly.
1771400	1774640	Yeah, I did a really good job tonight.
1774640	1777480	I know there's only two of you, but I'm doing automatic gratuity.
1777480	1784320	20% is generous and customary, but I really think this was more of a 35 night.
1784320	1786600	I kind of knocked it out of the park with y'all.
1786600	1789400	Yeah, so that's allowed.
1789400	1790400	And also...
1790400	1791960	Okay, I think I deserve more luck.
1791960	1792960	Yeah, me too.
1792960	1793960	You don't.
1793960	1797500	I think I would have had a stronger case.
1797500	1801140	So from here on out, let's go ahead and do that.
1801140	1806660	And hopefully the luck economy can start changing more throughout.
1806660	1812980	I'm hoping not only will I try to put you in situations where maybe luck is more necessary,
1812980	1815660	that's just going to happen based on the story that we're playing.
1815660	1820680	And also keep doing cool stuff, keep role playing well, and you'll gain more luck.
1820680	1822340	Can we speculate and trade luck?
1822340	1823340	No.
1823340	1824340	Okay, well...
1824340	1825340	I'm going to short luck, Joe.
1825340	1827740	So it's not really an economy.
1827740	1831080	I think you're going to get luck tonight, okay?
1831080	1833840	I bet you 50 luck you get luck tonight.
1833840	1839080	But yeah, I bet you 10% of that luck that you will get luck.
1839080	1840080	I don't understand it.
1840080	1841080	So...
1841080	1842080	Why would he make that bet?
1842080	1844080	Yeah, like I give you luck if I'm lucky?
1844080	1849280	Yeah, and if you're not, then I give you a little bit of luck and you get some anyway.
1849280	1851180	Let's think about this later.
1851180	1853040	I have no idea where to start.
1853060	1857960	So we're all sitting, we're literally standing there in a stunned silence, and then we would
1857960	1863580	probably reiterate, so uh, what do you feel this like, that old man, that the world isn't
1863580	1864580	as we know it?
1864580	1868320	Probably got something to do with all the shit that we've seen recently.
1868320	1871660	She was talking about saving humanity, like that's some heavy shit.
1871660	1872660	That's super hero shit.
1872660	1874780	Isn't that why we became police officers?
1874780	1876600	To save humanity.
1876600	1879580	Why did you become a police officer, Keith?
1879580	1882940	Well, it seemed easy, and so far it's been pretty easy.
1886820	1887820	So the...
1887820	1889620	They didn't trust me to be a doctor.
1889620	1894060	The thing that I've devoted my life to, you got into because it was easy?
1894060	1895580	Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
1895580	1896580	Oh Keith.
1896580	1904900	I mean, I graduated, well, I wasn't the, I was in the class, yeah, I graduated at the,
1904900	1905900	in the class.
1905900	1908020	I wasn't the top of my class, but...
1908020	1909020	Well that's something.
1909460	1911940	Yeah, I graduated from the police academy.
1911940	1916780	I also love the movie police academy, that's one reason, cause I was hoping that I'd work
1916780	1919520	with somebody that could make cool noises.
1919520	1921820	What if you tried to bring that to the table yourself?
1921820	1922820	No, I'm not very good at it.
1922820	1923820	You could be the cool noises guy.
1923820	1924820	I don't really have any skills.
1924820	1925820	Try a helicopter.
1925820	1926820	That's it, Landy.
1926820	1927820	Just keep working.
1927820	1928820	Um, no.
1928820	1929820	Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.
1929820	1930820	Oh yeah, it's been super easy.
1930820	1931820	It's been super easy.
1931820	1932820	It's been super easy.
1932820	1933820	It's been super easy.
1933820	1934820	It's been super easy.
1934820	1935820	It's been super easy.
1935820	1938420	Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.
1938420	1940620	Oh yeah, the Delta...
1940620	1943620	Uh, fuck.
1943620	1946620	The mysterious organization.
1946620	1949620	So do you think we're dealing with some like X-Files type...
1949620	1951620	I'd say exactly like X-Files.
1951620	1953620	What's X-Files?
1953620	1956620	No, Clark would definitely know what X-Files is.
1956620	1959620	Like, like a fictionalized ancient aliens?
1959620	1964820	Okay, so we, we have no information about what she just said, but I feel like it makes
1964820	1965820	sense.
1965820	1967220	She asked us to stop the incursion.
1967220	1970820	Do you think the incursion could be that black oily goo we've been seeing?
1970820	1971820	It seems like exactly...
1971820	1972820	That could be it.
1972820	1974820	Yeah, that's, that seems like the incursion to me.
1974820	1975820	How do we stop it though?
1975820	1976820	We get a...
1976820	1981420	Dude, we should find out what this bag is made out of and make a big, big one and just
1981420	1982420	put it...
1982420	1983420	Over the town.
1983420	1984420	Over the town.
1984420	1985420	Like a dome.
1985420	1986420	Well, uh...
1986420	1987780	Like the Simpsons movie.
1987780	1992220	Me and John ran into this guy yesterday who was sucking it up in a vacuum and it seemed
1992220	1994100	to be working for a while there.
1994100	1996100	And yeah, it, it just worked.
1996100	1997100	Like a drive-back?
1997100	1998100	Yeah.
1998100	2001220	It kind of looked like just a hoo, it was, did it look like a Hoover?
2001220	2002220	I think you described it.
2002220	2003220	Like a wet-vac?
2003220	2004220	H-vac?
2004220	2009500	It was a, like a, yeah, like just a normal upright vacuum with a bag.
2009500	2012260	Yeah, it just looked like a normal upright vacuum with a bag.
2012260	2014200	It also had a hose, like a wand.
2014200	2017300	Should we put an alert out for all citizens to be at the ready?
2017300	2019940	Well, what about those gather their vacuums?
2019940	2023100	Didn't they mention something about a couple of kids missing?
2023100	2024100	I think that was unrelated.
2024100	2025100	Yeah, I don't know about that.
2025100	2026100	We were in the area.
2026100	2027100	Yeah, that's...
2027100	2028100	Was that not kind of where you guys were?
2028100	2031180	No, we'll probably have to investigate that when we get finished with all this stuff.
2031180	2032180	Okay, yeah.
2032180	2033180	They probably just ran away.
2033180	2038140	I know that we just got a lot of weird shit thrown at us, but we were going to go check
2038140	2041140	out the mill before, you know, the whole house explosion.
2041140	2043100	That can definitely be our next step.
2043100	2047460	Wait, weren't we all going to split up and go to, we had three different places we were
2047460	2048460	going to go to.
2048460	2049460	Yeah, at the end.
2049460	2050460	It was the mill?
2050460	2051460	We talked about that.
2051460	2052460	What was the other two places?
2052820	2054420	The mill, the church, because the church has a helmet.
2054420	2057620	The third place was investigating the chief's father, but that's the mill.
2057620	2062280	So he worked at the mill, so, okay, so we need to check out the helmet at the church
2062280	2064860	and the mill and the chief's father.
2064860	2067800	I feel like there was a third, a real third, third thing.
2067800	2071180	Were there any property crimes we needed to investigate?
2071180	2074380	Like any break-ins, random home?
2074380	2075380	What about the trashings?
2075380	2079420	Well, no, the hospital burnt down, but there's some of the hospital burnt.
2079460	2080460	Yeah, the hospital burnt down.
2080460	2081460	It's...
2081460	2083460	But we weren't going to do that.
2083460	2089780	While you guys are talking, you hear Drew's phone start ringing and he picks it up.
2089780	2094980	Drew, Andrew, Contingent Police Department, can you hold for a moment of silence for our
2094980	2095980	chief?
2095980	2098100	Oh, you have what?
2098100	2099100	Okay.
2099100	2100100	Okay.
2100100	2101100	Yeah.
2101100	2102100	I'll send them right over.
2102100	2109380	Uh, hey, officers, Gary Daley has information about the chief's house blowing up.
2109380	2114820	You guys would know that Gary Daley is the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and he's
2114820	2120000	also the owner operator of The Daily Pho.
2120000	2121000	The Daily Pho?
2121000	2122000	The Daily Pho?
2122000	2125980	Is that like a Korean or a Vietnamese newspaper?
2125980	2134660	Uh, no, it is a, uh, is The Daily Pho spelled D-A-L-Y, as in Gary Daley, and it is a pho
2134660	2138780	restaurant located in the northeast corner of downtown Contingent.
2138780	2141220	You'd know this place has been around for generations.
2141220	2142220	Damn.
2142220	2143220	Okay.
2143220	2146060	Let's, uh, I think we should not split up as long as possible.
2146060	2147060	Not yet.
2147060	2148060	No, yeah.
2148060	2149060	I still want you guys in here.
2149060	2150060	Yeah.
2150060	2151900	I'm kind of a lone wolf, but I'll stick with you guys for now.
2151900	2153300	We're going to head over to Gary.
2153300	2154300	Gary's.
2154300	2155300	Okay.
2155300	2156300	Yeah.
2156300	2161180	He's at his place of business in northeast downtown is where The Daily Pho sits.
2161180	2165780	When you guys walk in, there are lots of pictures hanging on the walls of the history of this
2165780	2172060	restaurant, including one very large picture of four generations of Daley's, a young Gary
2172060	2176020	Daley, his mother, grandmother, and great grandfather.
2176020	2180460	They had all owned and operated this restaurant at one time or another.
2180460	2185700	There are also a bunch of prints with black and white designs on them.
2185700	2189880	One is a circle with a star inside of it.
2189880	2194860	Inside that star is another star, and there are a couple of triangles, curved lines and
2194940	2197080	tiny circles as well.
2197080	2202380	Another is a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing
2202380	2203960	on the other.
2203960	2209340	Another print is a black circle with six black dots surrounding it.
2209340	2215700	Another is a wonky question mark with lines, one curved and one straight jutting down from
2215700	2217780	the question marks dot.
2217780	2224100	And behind the counter comes walking an older man, but he dresses very hip.
2224100	2229560	He's wearing jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short-sleeve button down with tiny
2229560	2232540	cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it.
2232540	2240900	He walks up to you and immediately says, do you guys remember, you guys, hey officers,
2240900	2246660	hey, do you guys remember when I would help watch you down at clinkers when you were but
2246660	2249300	wee little fellas?
2249300	2250300	Sure do.
2250300	2251300	Absolutely, yeah.
2251300	2252300	Good to see you again.
2252300	2253300	Thanks.
2253500	2256900	All right, come on, come on back, come on back here.
2256900	2261320	And he, uh, and he starts walking back to a little office in the, in the back of the
2261320	2262320	daily pho.
2262320	2265620	Real quick, the symbols on the wall, were they like framed photos?
2265620	2266620	How what were they?
2266620	2267620	They're prints, right?
2267620	2268620	They're prints.
2268620	2269620	Okay.
2269620	2270620	Yeah.
2270620	2271620	So they were like, like on paper, just yeah, they were just framed prints.
2271620	2272620	Okay.
2272620	2273620	Pretty artsy.
2273620	2274620	Cool.
2274620	2275620	We're back in the office at this point.
2275620	2279520	I do want to have a room in my house someday where I've just got a bunch of fucking pictures
2279520	2280520	of prints.
2280740	2285240	And I'm like, Hey, do you guys want to come see all my, my framed prints?
2285240	2286240	Nice.
2286240	2287240	Okay.
2287240	2289240	So we're in his office, his office.
2289240	2290240	Yeah.
2290240	2292960	And he sits down behind a small desk.
2292960	2296120	I, there's a tiny desk on three.
2296120	2297120	Yes.
2297120	2298120	He begins singing for you.
2298120	2301600	Uh, what a beautiful lullaby Gary.
2301600	2305720	Just like it's like he used to sing to everybody.
2305720	2306720	Come on down.
2306720	2308620	We're at the daily fall.
2308620	2311420	You got to get your fall.
2311420	2316980	And um, I remember those commercials and didn't run too long.
2316980	2318740	So thanks for calling Gary.
2318740	2324260	There's a, there's in the office, there's one chair on the other side of the desk.
2324260	2327500	So I don't know if somebody wants to sit down or if you guys are all standing.
2327500	2328500	My feet hurt.
2328500	2329500	So I'm going to sit down.
2329500	2330500	I stay standing.
2330500	2331500	Yeah.
2331500	2332500	John says, okay.
2332500	2340020	He says, uh, so it's, uh, it's kind of an embarrassing story, but, uh, I, I heard that
2340020	2345660	all, uh, Harold Dorsey was in town from the city and you know, he's got a pretty popular
2345660	2350780	blog these days and I wanted him to write a blog post about the daily fuss.
2350780	2357400	So I wasn't, I wouldn't call it stalking, but I was kind of following him around town
2357400	2359740	when I realized where he was.
2359740	2365020	And uh, I followed him over to the, to the chief's house.
2365020	2372460	Uh, didn't realize it was, it was that house at the time, but, uh, we saw, uh, I, I guess
2372460	2380540	I was watching him watch, uh, the, there's a, the chief's car pulled up and the chief
2380540	2386260	and uh, James, you know, James and uh, another guy got out.
2386260	2387260	I'm sorry.
2387260	2388260	I'm sorry.
2388260	2389260	James.
2389780	2390780	He's a mononym.
2390780	2391780	Yeah.
2391780	2393060	He's just James.
2393060	2394060	He works at the mill.
2394060	2396180	He lives over in the suburbs.
2396180	2397180	You guys don't know James.
2397180	2398440	He's a cool guy.
2398440	2399440	He was a cool guy.
2399440	2400440	Right.
2400440	2401440	What do you, what do you mean?
2401440	2403780	We don't talk about ongoing investigation.
2403780	2405700	Just go ahead and finish your story.
2405700	2407340	Then we'll forget about it.
2407340	2408340	Okay.
2408340	2413260	Well, uh, yeah, no, we saw the, uh, that other guy, I didn't recognize him, but he had the
2413260	2418860	chief and uh, and James at gunpoint and he was walking him into the house.
2418860	2420580	I thought that was really scary.
2420580	2427140	But then, you know, Dorsey, Dorsey left pretty quickly and I kept following him cause I wanted
2427140	2429180	that blog written.
2429180	2434380	And so he went to the police department and then I guess he went and picked up Drew and
2434380	2439980	they, they went back to the chief's house and so Drew was with him the second time.
2439980	2440980	That's his name, right?
2440980	2444860	The guy, your little fellow who works down there, he's Drew.
2444860	2445860	Cool.
2445860	2446860	Yeah.
2446860	2447860	Hey Gary.
2447860	2449740	So at gunpoint, how did chief look?
2449740	2451020	Did she, did she look scared?
2451020	2453300	Did she look like she'd been hurt previously?
2453300	2460420	I didn't really get a great view of it honestly, but uh, yeah, I mean, you know, she, she didn't
2460420	2461660	look herself.
2461660	2462660	That's for sure.
2462660	2468300	You know, she, she wasn't, she wasn't standing tall and proud like, like chief cook would,
2468300	2469300	you know?
2469300	2473760	Yeah, no, her and James got walked in there and you know, I was pretty scared, but I wanted
2473760	2476140	to follow Dorsey and see where he went next.
2476140	2477140	You know?
2477420	2481380	He followed him instead of calling in to the police.
2481380	2483980	Well he was going, I mean, he was going to the police.
2483980	2487380	I guess I didn't know that at the time, but I was pretty flustered, you know, it was a
2487380	2488380	crazy situation.
2488380	2493060	Gary, I've known you for a long time, man, you know I love you, but you had to have made
2493060	2494060	that call, man.
2494060	2495060	I'm sorry.
2495060	2499980	You know, the past is the past though and we got to move forward.
2499980	2506420	It just seems like maybe, obviously you're not directly responsible for anyone's demise,
2506420	2510140	but John Lee Pettymore has definitely seen it that way.
2510140	2515060	I mean, he looks really sad when you question him on it and he's like, I know, I'm sorry.
2515060	2519860	I mean, I certainly didn't expect the chief's house to up and explode on us.
2519860	2522900	That's certainly not what I expected to be the next course of action.
2522900	2525500	But you saw a person held at gunpoint.
2525500	2527820	That's not, you don't see that every day.
2527820	2530660	That's you got to say something when you see something.
2530660	2531880	I was scared.
2531880	2534780	Can you, can you give me a description of that other guy?
2534780	2535780	Which one?
2536140	2537140	The one that held him at gunpoint?
2537140	2540780	I mean, he was just a guy, you know, he was wearing all black.
2540780	2542300	I couldn't really get much on him.
2542300	2544780	I didn't recognize him, but was he, was he fat?
2544780	2545780	No, he was pretty fat.
2545780	2546780	Wait, I have a question.
2546780	2551940	Did we ever send, did we ever get any like of the dental record stuff figured out?
2551940	2553100	Did we send that off?
2553100	2556140	That was, I think our third thing we were going to try and that's what I was just thinking.
2556140	2557140	Okay.
2557140	2560100	And then you also, you mentioned Harold had a, had a blog.
2560100	2564220	Do you remember the name of that blog or the address for it?
2564660	2569700	Well, when you look up Harold Dorsey, you know, you, you'll find his blog.
2569700	2573480	I think it's called, uh, what's behind Dorsey BAM.
2573480	2575760	That's it.
2575760	2580880	It's called what's behind dorsey.com dot blog, spot.com.
2580880	2585700	So is Dorsey spelled like his name or like Dorsey name D O R S C Y.
2585700	2587700	Yeah, that guy's super duper clever.
2587700	2589060	I wish I could be like him.
2589060	2590060	Yeah.
2590060	2592020	He's a, he's real smart.
2592020	2593020	He was.
2593020	2594260	He's also a great writer.
2594260	2597420	I mean, he worked in the city for a long time.
2597420	2601220	So did you follow, you followed him to the police station and then you followed them
2601220	2602220	back to the house?
2602220	2603220	Yeah.
2603220	2604220	And then what?
2604220	2607580	Well, they went in there and I, I hung out for a little while, but then it got late and
2607580	2609080	I had to go help close.
2609080	2611980	So I just left and uh, came back here.
2611980	2613980	Could you guess how long you waited?
2613980	2614980	How long they were in there?
2614980	2616660	Oh, I only waited like 15 minutes.
2616660	2621060	I wasn't, you know, I wanted, you know, him to write something, but I figured I could
2621060	2623300	always, you know, catch him the next day.
2623300	2626540	Maybe if he stayed in town, it was pretty late already at that point.
2626540	2628420	So I figured he was going to stick around.
2628420	2629580	About what time was that?
2629580	2630580	I don't know.
2630580	2633060	It was around 1am maybe.
2633060	2634060	I don't know.
2634060	2635060	Okay.
2635060	2636620	No, it was later than that.
2636620	2640500	Now I can't remember, but they were having some trouble closing down here.
2640500	2644020	And so it was, it was around insert time.
2644020	2646340	Yeah, no joke.
2646340	2648140	Uh, wait, what time did I get there?
2648140	2649140	Like two.
2649140	2650700	That's why he's having trouble placing it.
2650700	2654780	I think it was like around two o'clock, but I don't because our stakeout was at one o'clock.
2654780	2658060	I was there from one 30 to one 45 am.
2658060	2659060	Exactly.
2659060	2660060	Thank you.
2660060	2661060	Thank you, Gary.
2661060	2663420	I time myself in all my endeavors.
2663420	2666380	So they pulled up in Maggie's car, all of all three of them.
2666380	2667700	Yeah, I think so.
2667700	2668700	Who was driving?
2668700	2671900	I think it was, I think it was the chief and they were in her cruiser.
2671900	2672900	Yeah.
2672900	2673900	Well they were in her.
2673900	2676380	Uh, yeah, they were in her car, her police cruiser.
2676380	2677660	Is that what you said?
2677660	2678660	Yeah.
2678660	2679660	Is there something?
2679660	2682820	This is Joe asking you guys, is there a better question we can ask to get more information
2682820	2683820	about the gunman?
2683820	2684820	I don't know.
2684820	2687900	I was trying to lead him with the fat and I was going to keep going, but all I remember
2687900	2689500	was he was fat and dead.
2689500	2691940	I mean, we were assuming it's the guy at the table.
2691940	2693020	I, yeah, I don't.
2693020	2695900	I just wondered if there was a way we could get even more because the guy at the table
2695900	2699740	was the one eating Maggie's foot and his, was it his, it was his own foot that was cut
2699740	2700740	off.
2700740	2701740	Right?
2701740	2702740	You, you have no idea.
2702740	2703740	I mean, he was missing a foot.
2703740	2704740	His foot was missing.
2704740	2708380	Her foot was missing and there are two feet in the, yeah, so I figured we can't jump to
2708380	2709380	any conclusions.
2709380	2712220	It's a good pun.
2712220	2713220	Two people can't.
2713220	2718340	Did the, did the gunman have any like tattoos or scars?
2718340	2722300	Oh yeah, he had a big scar.
2722300	2724420	He's all covered up by a giant tattoo.
2724420	2725500	His whole face was missing.
2725500	2726500	His whole face was scarred up.
2726500	2731100	Across his forehead it said Jerry, Jerry Pinkerton.
2731100	2734820	His whole face was scarred up.
2734820	2735820	Was it?
2735820	2736820	Oh yeah.
2736820	2737820	Yeah, no, actually he did.
2738260	2740580	He had a pretty big scar over, over one eye.
2740580	2741580	How about that?
2741580	2746140	That seems like a prominent feature that could help you.
2746140	2751980	Keith is trying to remember super hard whether or not the guy at the table had a scar over
2751980	2752980	his eye.
2752980	2755340	You would remember that he was not overweight.
2755340	2756340	He was not overweight.
2756340	2758540	Oh, that's the one thing I thought I knew.
2758540	2759540	I thought he was.
2759540	2760540	I thought he was a fat guy.
2760540	2765860	The one descriptor I think that was used to describe the guy hunched over was he was unkempt.
2765860	2766860	Fuck.
2766900	2767900	Unkempt.
2767900	2768900	Yeah.
2768900	2769900	Unkempt.
2769900	2772060	So this guy was fat and had a scar on his eye.
2772060	2773060	Yeah.
2773060	2774060	Was he tall or short?
2774060	2775060	He was kind of shortish.
2775060	2779140	Okay, so short, overweight, had a scar on his, which eye?
2779140	2781580	The one on my side.
2781580	2782580	So the right?
2782580	2783580	Sure.
2783580	2788460	So how many people did you, you saw, he saw him taking Maggie and who at gunpoint?
2788460	2789460	James.
2789460	2790460	Oh yeah.
2790460	2791820	The mononym to James.
2791820	2792820	So was-
2792820	2793820	He's a crazy fella.
2793820	2799340	He was wearing all sorts of, he was wearing one of those white over, over, what are they
2799340	2800340	called?
2800340	2803020	It's the stuff that you wear when you don't want stuff on your clothes.
2803020	2804020	Overall?
2804020	2805020	Coveralls.
2805020	2806620	James was wearing white coveralls.
2806620	2807620	Yeah.
2807620	2808620	Um.
2808620	2810940	And then, so was Dorsey already in the house?
2810940	2811940	I guess.
2811940	2812940	I don't know.
2812940	2813940	You were following him though.
2813940	2814940	Oh yeah.
2814940	2815940	No, they weren't in the house yet.
2815940	2816940	No.
2816940	2819420	When we saw those people, Dorsey was just watching as well.
2819420	2821280	That's before he went to the police station.
2821280	2824920	So Dorsey was not in the house before he went to the police station?
2824920	2825920	Correct.
2825920	2827120	Does Clark know James?
2827120	2828120	Uh, no.
2828120	2829120	Can you tell me more about James?
2829120	2830120	What'd he look like?
2830120	2834860	Oh he had like, his hair was going all over the place and he was wearing those white coveralls.
2834860	2838960	You seem to know a lot about him though, do you know if he and the chief were friends?
2838960	2840760	I never saw him together.
2840760	2846520	Uh, James, he moved to town not that long ago and well, it was probably a couple years
2846520	2851120	ago but that's, you know, pretty new kid in town for around here in contention.
2851120	2852880	How old of a guy is he?
2852880	2853880	James?
2853880	2854880	Yeah.
2854880	2855880	Well I don't know, he's middle aged or so.
2855880	2857280	Maybe a little younger.
2857280	2858360	Very helpful, Gary.
2858360	2861040	He's a little younger than middle aged.
2861040	2862720	38.
2862720	2863720	Seems right.
2863720	2870240	Gary, not to digress, what, those prints you have in your restaurant, do those have
2870240	2871640	any special meaning to you?
2871640	2878400	Are you, I mean, I, yeah, they're fun, I mean, you know, I'm really into like magics and
2878400	2882200	stuff like left hand, right hand path stuff, so.
2882200	2883200	Magic stuff?
2883200	2888160	Well, you know, just like fun, like a cult-y type stuff, I'm like pretty into that kind
2888160	2889160	of thing.
2889160	2891240	I used to be more into it, but.
2891240	2892880	How much do you know about all that?
2892880	2896800	I mean, I read a fair amount, I'm like really into that kind of stuff.
2896800	2902600	It's really, I don't know, it's like, it's fun to think that maybe there's more to the
2902600	2904160	world than there is, but, you know.
2904160	2907640	Do you believe it or is it just like a fantasy kind of thing?
2907680	2913200	Well, I mean, it's just like being into sports or anything else, you know, it's like, oh,
2913200	2914200	that's fun.
2914200	2919640	If we had a bunch of questions, hypothetically, about a cult-y type stuff, you think you might
2919640	2922440	know information that could shed some light on those things?
2922440	2926280	Well, I've read quite a bit, I could probably point you in the right direction.
2926280	2927280	Right on.
2927280	2928280	Good to know, good to know.
2928280	2929280	What do those symbols mean?
2929280	2930600	What do they symbolize?
2930600	2931600	Which one?
2931600	2932600	All of them.
2932600	2937440	The one with the dark circle with the circle, the other dots around it.
2937440	2938440	What's that one?
2938440	2939440	What if we go in order?
2939440	2942160	All right, I mean, yeah, sure, why not?
2942160	2948460	The one with the circle with the other circles around it is, it's this old ancient sign for
2948460	2954640	this weird group that used to exist, maybe, I don't know, have you ever, I forget, it's
2954640	2960760	like this group that tries to like keep the world together kind of thing.
2960760	2962240	What are they called?
2962280	2964880	They're called the circle of knowledge.
2964880	2965880	How many people were in it?
2965880	2966880	Oh, I don't know.
2966880	2968560	I mean, it's probably not real.
2968560	2969560	It's like the Illuminati.
2969560	2970560	Okay.
2970560	2972400	How about the one with the tree branches?
2972400	2974400	Oh, I don't know much about that one.
2974400	2979760	That's just, it was on a bunch of old texts that I've seen around before and I always
2979760	2980760	liked it.
2980760	2981760	I thought it was real pretty.
2981760	2982760	Seen around where?
2982760	2988040	Oh, at different museums and different libraries and such.
2988040	2994280	And in relation to any particular culture or across many cultures and times.
2994280	2996240	Seems like probably the latter.
2996240	3001200	And then there's one that's like some stars and some swirls and some triangles.
3001200	3008920	Oh yeah, that one's just like a fun take on like the chaoticness of the universe.
3008920	3011960	Has my voice changed during this conversation?
3011960	3015600	It's it's no more than usual.
3015600	3016760	It's consistent enough.
3016760	3017760	Yeah.
3018480	3019720	I'm not like, Whoa man, who am I talking to?
3019720	3020720	All right, cool.
3020720	3022520	Yeah, no, as long as you know, it's me, Gary.
3022520	3023520	Wait, were there four?
3023520	3025080	How about the weird question mark one?
3025080	3028120	Oh, that one's about a land unknown.
3028120	3029680	Do you know anything about it?
3029680	3033080	Officer Vigna, why would you ask me such a silly question?
3033080	3034080	I'm just goofing.
3034080	3035080	You're funny.
3035080	3036080	New boot goofing.
3036080	3038080	A land unknown.
3038080	3039080	Well, that's, that's mysterious.
3039080	3042200	Can you tell us more about the circle of knowledge?
3042200	3047600	I mean, all I really know about it is like, maybe there's like one person in the middle
3047600	3053760	and then maybe six people underneath that person and they hold the knowledge of the
3053760	3055320	universe or something like that.
3055320	3056320	I don't know.
3056320	3057320	It seems cool though.
3057320	3058320	It's a pretty sweet design.
3058320	3063480	You seem, you seem a little casual about all these, but you've, you've taken the trouble
3063480	3066200	to get these nice prints made and had them put up in your restaurant.
3066200	3067200	Oh yeah.
3067200	3068200	I'm a fan.
3068200	3070280	If we, so you, you put these up though.
3070280	3072440	They haven't been, how long have they been in the restaurant for?
3072440	3075080	I put them up 30 years ago.
3075080	3076080	Okay.
3076080	3078960	The pho restaurant when your great grandfather had it.
3078960	3079960	Yeah.
3079960	3080960	The daily pho.
3080960	3083520	It's been called that since my great grandfather started it.
3083520	3088600	Do you know how he got around contentions, extremely strict obscenity loss?
3088600	3089780	Yeah.
3089780	3090780	One continent.
3090780	3091780	There you go.
3091780	3092780	All right.
3092780	3093780	Okay, Gary.
3093780	3097840	Well, do you guys have anything else for him or you haven't seen James today at all?
3097840	3098840	Have you?
3098840	3099840	No.
3099840	3102560	Where do you think we, do you have James's number or any contact information for him?
3102560	3105920	I'm pretty sure he lives over in the suburbs, but I don't know.
3105960	3108960	Do you have an exact address or do you have a phone book perhaps?
3108960	3111320	Uh, yeah, I've got a phone book.
3111320	3113080	All businesses have a phone book.
3113080	3114080	That's what I figured.
3114080	3115400	Throw that phone book over here.
3115400	3116400	Let me.
3116400	3117400	He throws the book at you.
3117400	3118680	I, it hits, it hits me.
3118680	3119680	Get it?
3119680	3120680	Oh, ha ha.
3120680	3121680	You're in jail man.
3121680	3123680	Like a, like a police officer.
3123680	3124680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3124680	3125680	Well.
3125680	3126680	Would do.
3126680	3127680	Yeah.

3174360	3175360	There's nothing there.
3175360	3177360	The phone book catches fire.
3177360	3178360	Okay.
3178360	3180360	Well, uh, he gets angry at you.
3180360	3182360	He's like, get out of my restaurant.
3182360	3187760	So I have the address for just James, but we know he works at the mill and we also have
3187760	3188760	business.
3188760	3190080	You guys want to go to the mill?
3190080	3191080	Yeah, I do.
3191080	3193520	But Gary, you know that circle of knowledge thing.
3193520	3194520	That's a cool idea.
3194520	3198040	Do you know of any of anything around today that might still carry on that mission?
3198040	3202940	Well, it said that the circle of knowledge is all inclusive and all seeing and all abroad
3202940	3207360	the stores of America and across the world itself.

3214960	3215960	Appreciate it.
3215960	3216960	Thanks.
3216960	3219280	Uh, do you guys want any pho?
3219280	3222840	I was just about to say, we just had, we just had breakfast.
3222840	3226120	I just watched Keith eat a big old mess of beans.
3226120	3227120	So many beans.
3227120	3229080	I can back some noodles up to go with some broth.
3229080	3230960	I've been thinking about calling him beans.
3230960	3232760	Did he like beans as a baby?
3232760	3233760	This one?
3233760	3234760	No, he liked cut up hot dogs.
3234760	3235760	Oh, good.

3238760	3239760	That's all he ate.
3239760	3240760	Ever.
3240760	3241760	He's the pinky cedar I'd ever seen.
3241760	3242760	Or maybe the least picky.
3242760	3272000	How am I, the only one trying to pull over, how am I, the only one trying to pull over,
3273000	3279480	How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?
3279480	3293560	There's nobody home, nobody home, nobody home.
