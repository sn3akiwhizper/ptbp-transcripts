0	3400	Hello, insert audience name.
3400	10000	It is I, Host the Animal, and I am here to verb your... body parts?
10000	14400	Damn, my producer wrote me a weird-ass intro this week.
14400	16800	I'm gonna wing this one, y'all.
16800	19200	Greetings, audience members.
19200	27800	It is I, Wolf the Dog, and I am here to gobble your biscuits and... bake... some... some biscuits.
27800	30100	This shit's too hard, man.
30100	33400	Let's skip to the fan stuff, why don't we?
33400	42800	This blessed edition of Howlin' with Wolf is from Cyrus, GW, in Snellville, Georgia,
42800	46800	who tweeted about the show and tagged "@pretendingpod",
46800	49800	a thing you could easily do right now.
49800	51700	Like, so easily.
51700	54300	Just fuckin' do it, dude.
54300	62700	Just type, I listen to "@pretendingpod", and you should, too, if you're nasty enough to handle it.
62700	66000	And tweet. See? Easy.
66000	70600	Be like Cyrus, GW, in Snellville, Georgia.
70600	73500	Cyrus, GW, writes,
73500	75000	Dear Dog,
75000	81700	The only thing that keeps me happy is my favorite DJ Dog the Wolf along with his dog, Wolf,
81700	85700	who plays me sweet new tunes every other week.
85700	93300	I'd like to shout out Becca, Kim, Chris, and Kristen for introducing me to TTRPGs,
93300	103700	and Kane, Ellie, Charlie, Alex, Other Alex, and Emile for lettin' me haunt them with my TTRPG ideas,
103700	106500	which I hope to do again soon.
106500	107900	Wait a second.
107900	111100	This is Dog the Wolf, right?
111100	114300	The wolf that eats my recyclables?
114300	116500	Or is this the wrong number?
116500	120100	Either way, fuck Zuck Markleburg.
120100	122800	Did you just call me Dog?
122800	124100	The wolf?
124100	127500	Get the freakin' hell out of here, buddy.
127500	130200	Thanks for the email, pal.
130200	133300	Hope you have a good one, friend.
133300	135200	And hey, you know what?
135200	139500	I would never chow down on any recyclables.
139500	145700	Only burgeoning bags with bountiful biomass for this beautiful babe.
145700	148800	If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,
148800	152900	tag at PretendingPod on Instagram or Twitter,
152900	156200	tag PretendingToBePeople on Facebook,
156200	162300	or write up a five-star review on the podcast app of your choice and send it on over,
162300	166300	or make that review a clear message to your wolfie,
166300	171900	and I might just howl it out because of the things you say about little ol' me.
171900	174500	Mmm, I'd like that.
174500	180500	Also, I don't want to be weird about money, but you should sign up for the Patreon.
180500	185300	Hey, it keeps my throat wet with that good, good sloppy juice,
185300	189900	so I can keep howling with the lush flow of words you hear now.
189900	196100	And second, you'll get immediate access to 41 exclusive bonus episodes
196100	200200	on the contention confidential RSS feed.
200200	202900	Y'all know what RSS means, right?
202900	205200	Really super stuff.
205200	212100	The most recent three episodes are the kickoff to a Patreon-exclusive campaign
212100	218900	run by Thomas and sit in the holler outside a contention in the aftermath of season one.
218900	221500	It has been an absolute blast.
221500	225900	Joe, Luke, and Zach are playing members of the Pettymore family
225900	229500	searching for the lost treasure of John Lee Pettymore.
229500	233900	If that sounds rad as fuck, and that's because it is,
233900	240100	and if you're looking for a link, the links are in the show notes.
240100	244600	And speaking of links, what y'all know about sausages?
244600	248100	It's, uh, it's time for the news.
248100	256400	Last time, Shelly St. Blythe, Jimmy Corrigan, Vincent T. Bory, and Meat Hook
256400	261700	went to the main offices of Holy Cow Farms, set off the alarms,
261700	267500	called Bowery Security, found a few different options for leads,
267500	275000	and viewed some strange security footage of Dr. Brock Hargrave and his missing co-worker.
275000	282000	With sirens in the distance, they bailed in the weirdest and most chaotic way possible.
282000	288200	They called up Aurin and Aaron Strummer from Strummer's Resonating Crystals,
288200	293200	who are purveyors of crystals and crystal meth, respectively,
293200	299400	and they learned that Dr. Brock Hargrave has been a... smoking meth, I guess?
299400	305800	That's wild. He seemed like he had a good head on his shoulders, good gut instincts.
305800	307000	Guess not.
307000	313500	And Aaron mentioned that Hargrave has been digging holes out by the Zeitgeist,
313500	317500	an abandoned space needle copycat in the city.
317500	324000	Taking us now to what is hopefully the most dysfunctional group at the cowboy's disposal,
324000	328500	it's Hudson Freeman with Muscles R. Springs.
337000	355000	ðŸŽµ
355000	362000	ðŸŽµ They fed some consolation ðŸŽµ
362000	369000	ðŸŽµ I was thinking the same thing ðŸŽµ
369000	376000	ðŸŽµ I am now mechanization ðŸŽµ
376000	383000	ðŸŽµ All my muscles work like springs ðŸŽµ
383000	387000	And with that... I promised.
387000	389000	They promised really put me on the spot.
389000	391000	They made a promise to me.
391000	395000	They made a promise to the boys. Welcome to episode three of this short arc
395000	397000	with our guest player, Becca Scott.
397000	399000	Woo!
399000	400000	Oh, hello.
400000	403000	She came back for a third episode.
403000	405000	I debated. You know?
405000	408000	I thought about, what happens if I never come back?
408000	409000	That's right.
409000	411000	You just walk away. End of the night.
411000	415000	Meat Hook just dipped in her sewer and... who knows?
415000	419000	Did she wash into the ocean? Was there a rainstorm?
419000	422000	Did she find some other way to get electricity?
422000	425000	Or the hole?
425000	429000	I think Fishface had something to do with it.
429000	430000	There's your cue.
430000	433000	What? Oh, sorry. What?
433000	435000	Fishface, you're here in the intro?
435000	439000	Oh yeah, here I'm in the intro and I think I can hang out for a second.
439000	441000	Well, you don't need to be here until we call in.
441000	444000	Okay, bye.
444000	445000	Wow.
445000	450000	The longest amount of time Fishface ever went without someone telling him to leave.
450000	455000	I got a William H. Macy face on because that shit...
455000	457000	Oh boy, it was shameless.
457000	459000	Let's get into this. We've got a lot of...
459000	461000	I was trying to get through his filmography.
461000	464000	Because that shit was Fargo.
464000	469000	And so, this group was headed to the zeitgeist.
469000	473000	I want a quick rundown of the interior of this stretch,
474000	476000	Escalade, as well as the...
476000	477000	Were we headed to the zeitgeist?
477000	480000	I thought we specifically said we were saving that for last
480000	482000	and there was another place to go, but I may be wrong.
482000	483000	You said that first.
483000	484000	Right, we called...
484000	488000	Let the DM direct it where the story is.
488000	493000	Don't tell him he's giving away where he wants us to go next.
493000	496000	Strummer's Resonating Crystals was called
496000	501000	and I think after that phone conversation with both Aaron and Arin Strummer...
501000	504000	Vincente is going to make a little more money after this.
504000	505000	That's right.
505000	510000	The phone call with him, I think, pointed us more strongly towards the zeitgeist.
510000	512000	Yeah, he was doing some digging out there.
512000	514000	Oh right, we were going to go...
515000	517000	And there's a telescope in the top.
517000	521000	Does anyone want luck for whoever says the name of whoever's doing the digging first?
521000	522000	Dr. Brock Hargrave.
522000	523000	Ooh, so close.
523000	524000	Dr. Brock Hargrave.
524000	526000	Sam Luke gets luck.
526000	527000	Luck.
530000	532000	Hey, I'll split it with you.
532000	533000	We each have half a luck.
533000	535000	That sounds useful.
535000	541000	So the way that we use luck in this game is you can spend luck if you have luck
541000	542000	or you don't have luck.
542000	544000	It's like a switch that's turned on or off.
544000	548000	And when you do have luck, you can turn your luck off by changing a dice roll
548000	551000	and you change the dice roll just by switching the numbers.
551000	552000	So if it's critical...
552000	553000	Just like real life.
553000	555000	Numbers match.
555000	558000	So you can't ever use luck on a crit.
558000	560000	That is a fun little wrinkle in this.
560000	567000	But if you've got a 50 and you roll a 54, you can use luck and make it a 45 and pass.
567000	568000	Boomtown.
568000	570000	Yeah, I know math. I'm with you.
570000	573000	And because you're our guest player, I'll give you luck as well.
573000	575000	Our listeners are not educated people, so...
575000	576000	Oh, I see.
576000	580000	Let's get this luck economy off the ground.
580000	587000	And for the wonderful, wonderful role-playing in the last couple episodes as me took,
587000	590000	I would like to award a luck here to Becca.
590000	591000	You're brown-nosing.
591000	594000	No luck for the other two, but you'll get it quickly.
594000	597000	Sorry, I am half a luck.
597000	599000	Oh, that's right. That's my bad.
599000	603000	We'll see how that's spent later, I guess.
603000	606000	Probably going to give it back to Luke.
606000	607000	So give me the rundown.
607000	608000	Who looks like what?
608000	609000	Who's doing what?
609000	610000	Who's driving what?
610000	614000	Who's driving what on these dark, dark roads?
614000	620000	Heading out to the outskirts of the city, out away from downtown, out away from the district,
620000	626000	where the office building was that you just strangled a random cleaner, threw them in their own van,
626000	632000	headed inside, set off the alarms, called the alarm company, made it worse,
632000	638000	and then talked to a security guard and talked to the woman who you knocked out.
638000	642000	She saw some of your faces and saw your stretch.
642000	643000	Dorothy.
643000	648000	Yeah, Dorothy saw your stretch escalate drive away as well and left her there,
648000	651000	headed off into the night to the zeitgeist.
651000	655000	I mean, not only did you talk to the security guard, you got up to some legitimate escapades.
655000	662000	Yeah, I sent them off after the tall, I think shirtless, long fingernailed.
662000	664000	I remember the long person.
664000	669000	But you also got there in the first place by running two blocks away to fire gunshots and draw their attention.
669000	670000	Right.
670000	675000	Because the rest of us got winded on the stairs.
675000	678000	Carrie and Joe's character.
678000	684000	Well, I think Vincente is sitting in one of the many seats in this stretch escalate,
684000	691000	and he's pouring Perrier in champagne flutes for the three people in?
691000	692000	I'm in there, yeah.
692000	693000	I guess five.
693000	696000	I'm pouring one for Goomba, the driver, and also for Fishface.
696000	697000	Hey, thank you.
697000	698000	I really appreciate that.
698000	699000	Oh, hey, thank you.
699000	701000	Oh, you can't pour a drink for the...
701000	702000	Well, you know what?
702000	703000	It's your game.
703000	704000	It's a Perrier.
704000	705000	You can drink it.
705000	714000	Meat Hook is poised on the floor of the Escalade because she's not used to riding in style like this
714000	721000	and kind of looks like a cat with tape stuck to her.
721000	723000	I'll take that champagne though.
723000	725000	Thank you.
725000	728000	It's Perrier, but he just hands it to her.
728000	733000	Oh, but now that she mentions it, is there perhaps a spirit or two in the car here with us?
733000	734000	She chugs it.
734000	736000	Has she ever had spicy water before?
736000	744000	You mean like a bottle of whiskey a night or just carbonated water?
744000	746000	Carbonated water.
746000	750000	I think not if there wasn't cola as well.
750000	751000	Yeah, this is new.
751000	753000	Like only if the syrup had run out.
753000	757000	This is the smoothest champagne I've ever stolen.
757000	759000	I didn't steal this one though.
759000	768000	To answer Shelly's question, Vincente just kind of motions towards the back, which is like a double door refrigerator.
768000	770000	Double door refrigerator?
770000	771000	Double door refrigerator.
771000	773000	Double door refrigerator.
773000	778000	Shelly finds the gin and starts pouring himself just a tumbler of straight gin.
778000	781000	Oh, yes, this will calm the nerves.
781000	785000	And what is happening in the Jeep that Jimmy Corrigan?
785000	789000	He's driving hands at 10 and 2, no music.
789000	791000	Oh, no.
791000	793000	Eyes constantly moving.
793000	795000	I was really hoping you would say just silent.
795000	802000	Yeah, just a situational awareness is the most important asset you have at any given time.
802000	806000	Okay, hit me with the mindset. What's running through Jimmy Corrigan's mind?
806000	811000	I bet he's drinking gin in there.
811000	814000	Such situational awareness.
814000	815000	I bet Shelly got to the gin.
815000	821000	I bet the kid thinks Perrier is champagne.
821000	824000	You know that Jimmy fella, he never used to let me drink in the car.
824000	829000	Well, this isn't really a car as much as it is a lifestyle.
829000	831000	This is some lifestyle.
831000	833000	We're used to a kid if we make it out of here.
833000	835000	Luke, not Vincenzi, that's a really good point.
835000	839000	And should we all invest in a stretch Escalade?
839000	841000	For the lifestyle.
841000	844000	You guys are heading to the Zeitgeist, which is an abandoned space needle.
844000	850000	And I think that Dylan B. from Deadwood, South Dakota did an excellent job describing the Zeitgeist.
850000	852000	So I'm just going to go ahead and read this.
852000	857000	It'll give you some backstory, some history of the Zeitgeist within the city that you would all kind of be aware of.
857000	867000	The Zeitgeist is a tower so clearly traced from Seattle's space needle that it hovers an embarrassed wallflower on the outskirts of the city.
867000	873000	It is primarily aesthetic by design and it fulfills this purpose to the detriment of all others.
873000	880000	The free outdoor observation deck has rusted and fallen away into the surrounding woods.
880000	885000	The expensive rotating restaurant is quietly creaked to a halt inside.
885000	891000	Its facade is as weathered and gray, but when the Zeitgeist's lights blink on among the foothills,
891000	900000	the weary citizens of the nearby city will still sometimes prod their children and tell them again that the aliens have come, cresting the horizon.
900000	904000	And the children will laugh or cry or ignore them altogether.
905000	911000	In its heyday, celebration packages included neon mocktails and costumed servers,
911000	914000	the parting gift, a white cotton t-shirt that read,
914000	917000	I was abducted at the Zeitgeist.
917000	922000	The phrase gained notoriety during a series of kidnappings in 2013 and was quietly retired.
925000	930000	I was thinking about turning this place into a t-shirt the whole fucking time you were reading that and then they did it for us.
930000	931000	Yep, they did it.
931000	932000	You don't get any of the profits.
932000	933000	Sorry.
933000	937000	The Zeitgeist is bright and gaudy and it makes no sound.
937000	940000	The forest's silent carnival.
940000	945000	Dylan! Oh my god! Everybody else is fired.
945000	947000	Dylan, where's your podcast?
947000	949000	Yeah, this is your podcast now, Dylan.
949000	950000	It's your podcast.
950000	952000	It's heavy. Good luck.
952000	958000	Did stories of the Zeitgeist play a big part in Meat Hook's formative years?
958000	969000	Actually, Meat Hook was abducted at the Zeitgeist, but only because her parents left her there on purpose.
969000	981000	And after a few weeks of just wandering up and down the elevator, eventually she was abducted by a kind of creepy guy in a van and that was Fishface.
984000	986000	Hey, what's up? Hearing your memory.
988000	992000	What is the age disparity between Meat Hook and Fishface?
992000	994000	Probably like 15 years.
994000	995000	Okay.
999000	1002000	I feel more conflicted about pushing this.
1002000	1006000	Divide about a 2 plus 7 is fine. Bye.
1008000	1009000	Uh, wow.
1009000	1011000	Vroom, vroom. We're going.
1011000	1013000	Dylan really wrote that, huh?
1013000	1014000	Dylan really wrote that. Good job, Dylan.
1014000	1017000	And you guys are heading out into...
1017000	1019000	Into the Zeitgeist.
1019000	1021000	Into the Zeitgeist.
1021000	1031000	The grounds are kind of just on a park that is still sometimes used. It's open. However, it is just kind of mostly abandoned.
1031000	1040000	All of the restrooms haven't been cleaned in ages. The parking lot is overrun with weeds and shit from the bathroom.
1040000	1047000	Just pouring out, making a flowing river down the hill. It's a long, long hill.
1047000	1054000	This parking lot is simply on an incline. One should park sideways according to where the parking spots are.
1054000	1058000	But if you park according to where the parking spots are, you should use a parking brake.
1058000	1064000	And in this parking lot, you see a turquoise 2001 Ford Escort and no other cars.
1064000	1066000	I used to drive a Ford Escort. Me too, dude.
1066000	1068000	Not Meat Hook. Back up.
1068000	1069000	Meat Hook's never had a car.
1069000	1072000	It's got Missouri plates somewhere out there.
1073000	1075000	I had a Ford Escort hatchback.
1075000	1080000	Mine was a ZX2. I could drive a stick. I assume I still can.
1080000	1085000	Meat Hook rolls down the window of the Escalade, takes a deep breath, breathing in the sewage, and says,
1085000	1087000	Smells like home.
1088000	1095000	Shelley used to party here back when it was in its heyday. Back when it was an actually nice restaurant up top that served those fancy drinks.
1095000	1101000	Oh my. It's been years since I've been out here. I didn't realize that they let it fall into such a disrepair.
1101000	1103000	I had such glorious days here.
1103000	1109000	I've been out here a handful of times. I'm kind of worried that he's digging holes out here.
1109000	1113000	He might, you know, find a little present we left over the years.
1114000	1116000	By he, you mean Shelley's nemesis?
1116000	1118000	Yeah, Mr. Dr. Brock.
1118000	1120000	Mark McGriff.
1120000	1123000	And by present, you mean dead bodies?
1123000	1124000	Who knows?
1125000	1126000	Got it.
1126000	1128000	God's gift to the earth.
1129000	1142000	Well, wasn't it? Okay. Yeah. God's gift anyway. You know, humanity and whatnot. If you believe such things. I don't. I believe we are descended from, well, that's a whole other story.
1142000	1143000	The planet Krypton.
1143000	1145000	I'm sorry. Meat Hook used to be explicitly Christian.
1148000	1150000	Did you not read the entire contract?
1151000	1153000	Oh yeah, that contract.
1154000	1157000	We're descended from aliens, but who made the aliens?
1158000	1164000	Well, I have two theories. One is the lizard government and two is the underground people we're about to become.
1165000	1167000	And who made both of those?
1171000	1175000	She goes cross-eyed trying to cross-reference all of her conspiracy theories at once.
1176000	1186000	It's a heavy summer night and the humidity is weighing on each and every one of you. Kind of each breath almost like you're swimming through it. It's so thick.
1187000	1194000	It's just quite warm out this evening and the grass is green. Nailed it.
1195000	1200000	Hey, doc. You're an anthropologist or a paleontologist or some kind of ologist.
1200000	1204000	If you were out here digging, looking for something, where would you start?
1205000	1210000	Of course I would start with the ground and if that didn't yield anything, I would move along.
1211000	1212000	Which area of this ground?
1213000	1214000	Oh, um, perhaps.
1215000	1217000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead and roll.
1218000	1219000	That's a 40 on a 50.
1220000	1223000	Maybe give out Craig and you can use him like a divining rod.
1225000	1226000	Incredible.
1226000	1237000	Craig is not a divining rod. He's one of my actors. He's not some toy to be played with. He puts on serious performances.
1238000	1243000	I'm sorry that I respected that he had other talents besides just acting, but we'll leave him to it.
1244000	1248000	Jimmy walks up at this point and he drops a couple bags down and he says,
1248000	1254000	where I come from, we called him witching rods, but here's the thing. If you want to know where he's dig.
1258000	1260000	If you want to know where he has dug.
1262000	1265000	We should probably just look for the holes.
1266000	1267000	Is the past tense?
1268000	1269000	Digged.
1270000	1272000	Did my anthropology role throw me into a spot?
1273000	1274000	Yeah, absolutely it did.
1274000	1281000	I believe if I were here and I was leading an excavation, it would be over here. This is where the ground is most disturbed.
1282000	1286000	Oh, definitely disturbed. You see that there are some mounds that are already like...
1287000	1288000	Mounded.
1289000	1290000	Yeah, out of the ground elsewhere.
1291000	1292000	They've been de-grounded.
1293000	1294000	Sitting above where they used to be.
1295000	1297000	You can see here that the dirt has been de-grounded. We should start our search here.
1297000	1309000	And you continue to look and looking down at the ground, you all kind of notice as your eyes adjust to the dark up in this area that is kind of in a clearing up by the zeitgeist itself.
1310000	1316000	The trees kind of surround you and looking down, you see mound after mound after mound.
1317000	1318000	It's like puberty.
1323000	1324000	And then two holes.
1324000	1332000	They're at the ends that have not been filled in, but the rest are clearly where the ground was dugged up.
1333000	1334000	Digged.
1335000	1337000	And then it was splatted back down, slapped on into the ground.
1338000	1340000	So hold and un-hold back in?
1341000	1342000	Fucked and un-fucked.
1343000	1348000	And I need whoever has SIGINT. If anyone has above basic SIGINT, go ahead and roll that.
1349000	1351000	That's me even though I forgot what it means.
1352000	1353000	Signals.
1354000	1355000	I know signals.
1357000	1360000	We got a 35 under 40. That's a success.
1361000	1362000	Fuck yeah, so I failed.
1363000	1365000	But it doesn't matter. Meat Hook's got my back.
1366000	1373000	Meat Hook always has your back unless you cross her and then she will stab you in the back six to seven times with her butterfly knife.
1374000	1375000	Oh I like to hear that.
1376000	1379000	For a grown man you might need to stab upwards of a dozen times to really put them down.
1380000	1381000	Well yeah, I'm not trying to kill anybody.
1381000	1384000	Anything that comes out of your mouth is only making me like you better, kid.
1385000	1388000	Thanks. Most people find me very off-putting.
1389000	1394000	Meat Hook, you should join the army. You shouldn't join his criminal organization. It was the best thing I ever did with my life.
1395000	1396000	I don't follow rules. Too good.
1397000	1398000	They'll teach you.
1399000	1400000	No, I don't like being taught things.
1401000	1402000	Maybe you should join his criminal enterprise.
1403000	1407000	We don't make you learn anything except how to kill better.
1408000	1410000	If you need to, we try not to do it all the time though.
1411000	1412000	It's the 21st century.
1413000	1414000	The army is the same thing with buddies.
1415000	1417000	Perhaps you'd like to become an archaeologist?
1418000	1428000	Look, I got a job. It's called handing out pamphlets and flyers on the street corner and finding out what's really going on.
1429000	1432000	Which is what we need to do right now. You got a pamphlet for this?
1433000	1436000	Meat Hook can kind of figure out what's going on right now. Becca, I've shared my screen with you.
1437000	1438000	I see it.
1438000	1450000	So this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten mounds that are completely filled back in and then two empty holes. So twelve total.
1451000	1457000	Hold on. Stand back. Pretend you're up real high and look at these mounds. Don't you all see it?
1457000	1463000	There's a backwards L and then a tiny little L and then a little straight line with two mounds.
1464000	1469000	And then, you know, like an F but missing the other across line.
1470000	1475000	It's Braille. It says hashtag HCF.
1476000	1477000	Hashtag?
1478000	1479000	Is that what it says?
1479000	1489000	That is what it says. And you would know from your knowledge of signals that when you were using Braille, you put the number sign before letters.
1490000	1495000	The letters are interacting with numbers on the alphabet in a direct way. So A is one, B is two.
1496000	1503000	Okay, so H is eight, C is three, and F is six. Someone else figure this out.
1503000	1509000	Becca, he fucking loves Braille puzzles. He tried to do this shit to me on my 30th birthday while I was on acid.
1510000	1512000	He's like, figure out this Braille puzzle, motherfucker.
1513000	1519000	I think it's eight, three, six. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. I nailed it. First try.
1520000	1525000	You absolutely got it. And you also notice that the H, C, and F seem familiar to you for why?
1526000	1527000	Hard cousin fuckers.
1528000	1529000	Hard cousin fuckers.
1530000	1531000	Cousin?
1532000	1533000	Heart grade.
1534000	1535000	Heffers. Cheese?
1536000	1537000	Perhaps if I...
1538000	1539000	Holy cow farms.
1540000	1542000	If I put an exclamation point here, there would...
1543000	1544000	Holy cow farms.
1545000	1550000	Wait, are the numbers also important, or did you just have her translate it from letters to numbers back to letters?
1551000	1555000	Translate it back into letters. Genius. A perfect code.
1562000	1565000	It's just how Braille works, man.
1566000	1571000	Actually, you know what? I don't even know if that's true. It's how this online Braille translator works.
1572000	1573000	Nice.
1574000	1574000	
1575000	1577000	So the numbers did not actually matter? Is that what you're saying?
1578000	1579000	Everything matters, Joe.
1582000	1589000	These words also come out of Meat Hook's mouth at the same time that any players may have heard them.
1589000	1595000	It all has significance, okay? The stars? They were put there to send us messages.
1596000	1601000	Yeah, you're telling me I saw the stars align into another star with flames and eyes.
1602000	1603000	And that's how I got here in the first place.
1604000	1606000	How did we never talk about that? That's a lot.
1607000	1612000	I don't know. It's why I started my whole moon rock business on the side.
1613000	1615000	You're talking to the biggest star signal guy in the whole town.
1616000	1622000	I literally watched and threw my telescope as the stars arranged themselves differently.
1623000	1626000	And that's how I got wound up in this whole mess.
1627000	1632000	I'm doing freaking mythical quests on the side while I'm running the family business.
1633000	1636000	Okay, Vincente. I have to tell you something that may be hard to hear.
1637000	1638000	Tell me.
1639000	1640000	You might not be real.
1641000	1642000	What? What does that even mean?
1642000	1645000	I don't know. It's just, it came to me.
1646000	1651000	I think that you could be a figment of our imagination here to tell us a message.
1652000	1656000	You could be just with the aliens, like they're signposts, you know?
1657000	1659000	But your intelligence is artificial. Do you ever think about that?
1660000	1662000	You're the simulation, maybe, man.
1663000	1666000	Can I roll to see if Vincente wants to literally just-
1667000	1667000	
1667000	1668000	Roll grip.
1669000	1672000	If that's true, I do not pass my grip.
1673000	1674000	Roll a d4.
1675000	1678000	Because you gave, your option was like believing it.
1679000	1683000	Two. So I believe it. And I want to, I'll lose two.
1684000	1689000	I want to think really hard and whatever the first thing that comes to my mind, that is what I believe the message is.
1690000	1694000	Okay, so what is the internal monologue of Vincente Bory?
1694000	1702000	First things first, first thing in your mind, mounds on the ground, dirt all around, the space needle above you, the zeitgeist.
1703000	1707000	We need to get up to the top of the needle and drop something into these holes.
1708000	1709000	And it'll all make sense.
1711000	1712000	I'm with you.
1713000	1715000	You were sent here to tell us that, so I'm with you.
1716000	1717000	It's not a bad idea.
1718000	1719000	Vincente then tries to see if he can just float.
1719000	1725000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this a trust fall?
1726000	1731000	He's doing like the Chris Angel mind freak float thing where he's just actually up on one like tippy toe.
1732000	1733000	And he's like, I'll try, I'll try later.
1734000	1736000	I want to look in the holes.
1737000	1739000	The empty ones are the ones that have been filled.
1740000	1745000	Yeah, so it's about four feet deep, about two feet wide, about three feet long.
1746000	1747000	Yeah, he could drop something in here real good.
1747000	1753000	Inside is dirt and some rock from the local under what the rock that's under the ground kind of rocks.
1754000	1755000	Oh, city stone.
1756000	1759000	Yeah. You would recognize it as a highlight.
1760000	1762000	Oh, this is a beautiful specimen of highlight here.
1763000	1764000	That's the kind of thing Shelley would know.
1765000	1765000	
1766000	1770000	Okay, well, while you're jizzing over that, I'm going to go take a look at this Ford Escort.
1770000	1771000	Ford Escort.
1773000	1779000	Back out in the parking lot, Meat Hook is seeing this Ford Escort in this parking lot with only your two other cars.
1780000	1783000	No one else is around. It's really silent here. You hear some crickets.
1784000	1785000	Is it unlocked?
1786000	1787000	When you go up to it, you see that it is locked.
1788000	1796000	Looking through the windows, you see that there are zines all over the ground called Gnathic News, spelled with a silent G.
1797000	1799000	Gnathic News.
1800000	1802000	I think that Meat Hook would know all about Gnathic News.
1803000	1814000	Gnathic News is a local zine to the city and it is all about like Bigfoot and UFOs and is about any other cult things that are happening within the city.
1815000	1819000	Amateur shit. Of course that stuff's real. Do you even need to write about it anymore?
1819000	1830000	Vincente likes the idea of looking in the car because that's where we get the stuff to drop into the holes, of course.
1831000	1834000	So he is going to try to break into the car and steal some items.
1835000	1836000	Real criminology.
1837000	1845000	Yeah, I was going to say, as you walk up, you see this leather jacket studded elbow go smashing into the backseat window.
1845000	1849000	Oh my God. So I only have a 10 criminology, but I got a 4.
1850000	1856000	So as Meat Hook smashes this back window at the exact same time...
1857000	1867000	Vincente knows exactly how to get into the 2001 Ford Escort and he is kind of just like very quickly does something with the handle and it pops open.
1868000	1871000	Yeah, you Fonzie the side of the door in the right spot.
1872000	1878000	It's got one of those like old number padlocks, but it's from 2001 so it's just very clear that the code is 1234.
1879000	1886000	Right. That's the ones that all the numbers are like faded off of and then the window crashes.
1887000	1895000	Little, little pieces of glass just bust into this Ford Escort just ruining the person's day who owns this car.
1896000	1897000	Oh, didn't see you there.
1897000	1904000	Yeah, I've got a pretty good stealth, so I sneak up on people sometimes. See anything cosmic or cool back there?
1905000	1906000	Hit me with those searches.
1907000	1912000	Just a classic Gnathic news. Nothing going on here. That's not enough.
1913000	1914000	Gnath enough.
1915000	1918000	Oh no, that's a crit fail. Oh wait, no, that's a nine. It's a 69.
1921000	1922000	That's a crit success.
1923000	1924000	That's a good one.
1924000	1925000	Because that's a crit success.
1926000	1928000	Yeah, I got a 55 on a 40 so I did crit fail.
1929000	1931000	But we do occasionally forget that 96 is a crit fail.
1932000	1940000	We always forget that and so with the 69 that is going to completely outweigh the critical failure on the part of Vincenzi Bori.
1941000	1945000	So you just saved him a D4 of damage cutting himself on the glass that you busted through there.
1947000	1949000	Couldn't she use it on cool shit in the car instead?
1950000	1952000	Oh, she's definitely going to use it on cool shit in the car instead.
1952000	1953000	It applies to everything.
1954000	1955000	It applies to everything.
1956000	1957000	It's situationally excellent all around.
1958000	1965000	So as you go through this car you find there's an avoided ID for a Rowan Fitzpatrick.
1966000	1970000	I was under the assumption that this was Dr. Brock Hockgrave's car. Oops.
1971000	1974000	Shout out to Marie from North Carolina.
1975000	1976000	Oh, hey Marie.
1977000	1978000	Hey Marie, what's up?
1979000	1980000	Marie Marie.
1980000	1981000	Discord super mod.
1982000	1986000	Absolute brilliant person, kind tea drinker Marie. Thank you.
1987000	1990000	She's threatened to ban me from the Discord before so fuck you Marie.
1993000	1994000	Just kidding.
1995000	1996000	No, I agree with Marie too.
1997000	1999000	She should have done it a long time ago.
2001000	2008000	It is naughty in there and it is not Patreon exclusive so no matter what if you're a listener and you want to join the Patreon get on in there and have some fun.
2008000	2009000	He meant Discord.
2010000	2011000	What did I say?
2012000	2013000	Do join the Patreon.
2014000	2015000	Join the Patreon for not free.
2016000	2017000	Join the Discord for free.
2018000	2019000	And pay us money when you join the Discord.
2020000	2024000	When you get your Escalade stretch limo join the Patreon.
2025000	2026000	Right.
2027000	2034000	So Rowan Fitzpatrick on this ID is five foot seven, 32 years old, curly red hair, dark circles under their eyes.
2034000	2042000	They are wearing a brat pit band tee and tweed blazer over the top of it.
2043000	2044000	Do I know this person?
2045000	2047000	I mean they got a Nothic News in their car.
2048000	2049000	How familiar are you with Nothic News?
2050000	2054000	I know like everybody who's ever written there I'm pretty sure.
2055000	2063000	So yeah you would know Rowan Fitzpatrick works at the perfect print which is where they make Nothic News.
2064000	2066000	Well I've gotten my zines printed now and then so that makes sense.
2067000	2068000	Exactly.
2069000	2081000	So you've run into Rowan a couple times they're just like an androgynous dude and they're 30 somethings hanging out making zines talking to people about Bigfoot and UFOs in a very monotone voice.
2081000	2088000	This dude is maybe the most boring conspiracy theorist I've ever met Vincente.
2089000	2092000	You don't happen to have his phone number memorized do you?
2093000	2096000	I assume you don't have a cell phone.
2097000	2101000	Of course I don't have a cell phone. That's how they get you. They're triangulating you all the time.
2102000	2105000	You think I want them knowing my every move? The lizard people.
2106000	2108000	In the city I am the they to worry about.
2108000	2112000	You've got your hand reached back meatloaf like in between.
2113000	2114000	Meatloaf?
2116000	2118000	But I won't do that.
2119000	2120000	Meatloaf's here too.
2121000	2122000	I wasn't upset.
2123000	2124000	Hey it's Meatloaf.
2126000	2131000	Alright and so you got your hand just like deep in the like backseat crevice.
2132000	2134000	Paradise by the dashboard lights you know what I mean?
2135000	2144000	You whip out a business card. It is for the occult and unnatural investigative journalism association.
2145000	2147000	It says Rowan Fitzpatrick and it has a phone number.
2148000	2153000	I found the number. Here you go use your fancy cellular telephone on this Vincente.
2154000	2161000	Vincente puts his reading glasses on and pulls out his like iPhone 2 and is like
2161000	2168000	yeah can you read those numbers off to me? And he's like holding it really close to his face and he plugs in the numbers.
2169000	2170000	4206969.
2171000	2174000	4206969 area code 836.
2175000	2176000	Nice got it.
2177000	2181000	Send. Call. Loudspeaker. Taylor's voice.
2184000	2189000	We're gonna cut to the woods where Jimmy Corrigan and Shelly St. Blythe are standing.
2189000	2192000	What are you guys doing as you're looking at these holes?
2193000	2198000	Oh well as soon as I see there's nothing in the holes I look up Trigate Supply and give them a call.
2199000	2202000	I want to be taking in some of our surroundings. I realize we didn't do that when we got here.
2203000	2208000	Is the tower lit up tonight and is there any signs that somebody's been in or out near the front door?
2209000	2212000	When you said the tower light I assumed you meant like a flashing airplane light that's still on it right?
2213000	2214000	Yeah.
2215000	2216000	Just like blinking.
2217000	2218000	But there could still be lights inside.
2219000	2221000	And the generator like fucks up and like twitches out.
2222000	2223000	Is it on?
2224000	2225000	No.
2226000	2228000	But it's fucking cool and it is but not right now.
2229000	2234000	Then he's doing his anthropological work to see if he can figure out if there was any more to these holes than writing a message.
2235000	2236000	Was there a reason these holes are here?
2237000	2242000	What do you make of these holes doc? Do they look like your standard anthropological holes?
2243000	2244000	It's a 51 on a god damn 50.
2245000	2246000	I ain't gonna do it.
2246000	2252000	I don't understand why he would have been digging here. There's nothing of significance in this area.
2253000	2254000	I don't uh...
2255000	2256000	It's baffling to me.
2257000	2258000	He probably did it just to send the message.
2259000	2267000	As you call Tri-Gate Supply it's like 1045pm and you get a message.
2268000	2271000	Hey this is Tri-Gate Supply. No, new voice.
2272000	2273000	That was new.
2273000	2281000	Yeah, this is Tri-Gate Supply. If you leave your name and number I'll get on back with you.
2282000	2283000	Beep.
2284000	2295000	Our normal business hours are Monday through Monday 8am 430pm.
2296000	2297000	Beep.
2297000	2300000	My name isn't important. Who I am is not important.
2301000	2306000	But I do have a very particular set of skills. Or whatever the fuck he says. I've never actually seen taken.
2307000	2315000	I need to know what you're doing with Dr. Brock Hargrave. Call me back immediately at 421-6868.
2315000	2325000	And as you hang up you hear a phone ringing in the treeline just off to the side.
2326000	2329000	And you hear scuttling and someone like trying to silence their phone.
2330000	2333000	I mean I've got a pistol drawn and I'm running towards the treeline.
2334000	2336000	Hello do you consent to being recorded?
2336000	2337000	Hello do you consent to being recorded?
2338000	2345000	And you see an androgynous 5'7 30-something with unkempt curly red hair and dark circles under their eyes.
2346000	2353000	Wearing a brat pit tee. Yes, still. Cuffed straight-legged jeans, Doc Martens and a tweed blazer.
2354000	2359000	And when they're holding out this Panasonic RN-163 micro cassette recorder.
2360000	2361000	Hello do you consent to being recorded?
2362000	2363000	Who the hell are you?
2363000	2365000	My name is Rowan Atkinson. I am sorry.
2366000	2367000	That's not his name.
2370000	2371000	My name is Mr. Bean.
2372000	2375000	You got real beans for brains, kid. You could get killed out of here late at night.
2376000	2378000	Vincente is still ringing. I don't know.
2379000	2380000	I don't know what's going on.
2381000	2386000	Hello this is Rowan Fitzpatrick's phone. Please leave your number and I will call you back at an appropriate time.
2387000	2389000	Leave a message and tell him you're going to kill him.
2389000	2394000	I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. What else? What else?
2395000	2398000	If he doesn't come clean about...
2399000	2400000	If you don't come clean about the...
2401000	2401000	
2402000	2404000	Everything. I'll kill you.
2405000	2409000	And I'll burn down the perfect print too.
2410000	2411000	Give him a callback number.
2412000	2416000	And my callback number is 4226767.
2419000	2420000	Perfect.
2421000	2423000	Bye. Bye. Have a good one.
2424000	2425000	Bye.
2426000	2432000	I guess maybe we should go... Well, I'm going to grab two things out of this car because there's two holes that we need to drop stuff in.
2433000	2435000	Yeah, what do you find? What is some stuff you'd want to drop in a hole?
2436000	2440000	It's a little tiny figurine of Bigfoot and a...
2441000	2442000	A giant figurine of Bigfoot.
2443000	2445000	Like a carnival stuffed animal Bigfoot.
2445000	2449000	Does there happen to be a lucky rabbit foot around the mirror I could grab?
2450000	2451000	Yes. I do so.
2452000	2453000	What do you do with it?
2454000	2455000	She gets another point of luck.
2456000	2457000	Smell it.
2458000	2459000	In the pocket it goes.
2460000	2463000	Cutting back. They've got their recording device out to you.
2464000	2465000	I snatch it out of his hand.
2466000	2471000	They have just like a wildly blank face on and they're just, okay, so is that a no?
2471000	2475000	Okay, I'm going to ask you again. Are you trying to get yourself killed? What the fuck are you doing out here tonight?
2476000	2483000	I am not trying to get myself killed. I am doing investigative journalism and research. Why are you here? What brought you to these woods?
2484000	2485000	I live in these woods.
2486000	2488000	Have you seen the man digging here?
2489000	2490000	Have you seen the man digging here?
2491000	2492000	With the hat.
2493000	2494000	Cowboy hat.
2495000	2496000	Cowboy hat. He likes it.
2497000	2498000	Shiny little shovel.
2499000	2500000	Do you know Dr. Hargrave?
2501000	2502000	Why are you here?
2503000	2504000	That's part of why we're here.
2505000	2506000	Why are you here?
2507000	2512000	I am investigating what he has been up to. He has been seeming very sketchy.
2513000	2514000	How do you know Dr. Hargrave?
2515000	2522000	Immediately they've got a card in your face and it says the Occult and Unnatural Investigative Journalism Association, Rowan Fitzpatrick.
2523000	2528000	Yeah, you told us you were an investigator. How do you know Dr. Hargrave? He said he'd been acting weird lately.
2528000	2531000	Yes. He did not come to the meeting last night.
2532000	2533000	His body a little, you little spooky club?
2534000	2540000	I followed him and I saw him with the shovel and then I saw the holes in the ground after he left.
2541000	2544000	He does scare me a bit when he, I mean you know him, he is...
2545000	2546000	A dastardly bastard, yes.
2547000	2548000	Formidable, yes.
2549000	2550000	And a bastardly dastard.
2551000	2554000	We are friends of Dr. Hargrave's. We're trying to get some help for him.
2554000	2558000	Can you tell me everything you know about his activities in the last few days?
2559000	2563000	I was staying here to watch for him to come back to see what he was up to.
2564000	2566000	How long have you been wearing that Brat Pit shirt? Cool shirt.
2567000	2572000	Ah, thank you. I wear it on Saturdays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Mondays.
2573000	2577000	Aja heartburn, diarrhea, upset stomach. Ah shit, indigestion, upset stomach.
2578000	2579000	Knees and toes, yes.
2580000	2581000	Shelly, what do you think?
2582000	2583000	So he's been coming here for days now.
2584000	2591000	I just followed him last night but, and then Rowan, they kind of point to the holes in the ground.
2592000	2594000	I mean it takes a long time to dig holes so...
2595000	2596000	So about a hole a night.
2597000	2599000	Maybe two, three holes a night, you know, if he was up for it.
2600000	2601000	That's what she said.
2602000	2603000	Thank you.
2604000	2608000	I would like to sneak up from the side and sort of flank Rowan and then tackle him.
2609000	2610000	Stab him in the back six or seven times.
2611000	2612000	Just a regular tackle.
2612000	2615000	Yeah, go ahead and roll stealth to get that sneaky sneak.
2616000	2618000	Okay. Ooh, yeah, 2650.
2619000	2620000	They failed with a 48.
2621000	2623000	And that's a D4 minus one?
2624000	2625000	That is indeed.
2626000	2627000	Oh, I do one.
2628000	2630000	But I'm more trying to grapple them to the ground than hurt them.
2631000	2635000	You take Rowan Fitzpatrick directly to the ground and they are like,
2635000	2636000	Oh my goodness, the smell.
2637000	2646000	And that's like the first thing that they say is their face kind of hits into the soft, you know, summer humid ground below.
2647000	2648000	Sewage, water.
2649000	2650000	There's no sewage up in this area. It's kind of nice up here.
2651000	2654000	You can still kind of smell the sewage from the parking lot a little bit, but not as bad up here.
2655000	2658000	That's right. I'll know how to make him pass out and put my armpit over his mouth.
2660000	2662000	This is like the same as chloroform.
2666000	2672000	Rowan, you boring motherfucker. Tell us, what'd you do with Hargrave?
2676000	2678000	I removed my armpit so he can talk.
2679000	2684000	I did nothing to Hargrave. I am here to watch. I think like you all are also here to do.
2685000	2689000	And how come you didn't print my last zine? You cut the corners off.
2690000	2693000	The corners had the most foul images I had ever seen.
2693000	2695000	People need to see that stuff. It's real.
2698000	2699000	Why'd you cut the kids corners?
2700000	2701000	Cost.
2702000	2703000	I knew it.
2704000	2705000	The classic reason.
2706000	2711000	Sorry to lie to you about the images. So, if we're all here to investigate.
2712000	2716000	All you know is that he was acting funny. You don't know why. You don't know what brought him here.
2717000	2722000	He is interested in occult and unnatural things, such as I, seemingly such as you all are.
2723000	2727000	Do people go to this meeting that I heard you talking about as I snuck up through the woods?
2728000	2746000	Yes. The Cult and Unnatural Investigative Journalism Association is a tight-knit group of comrades who believe in investigating and making journalism entries into the world about the unnatural and occult findings that we get leads on.
2747000	2748000	How come nobody ever invited me?
2749000	2750000	Answer the question.
2751000	2758000	This is the first time Rowan looks, like, kind of shook. And they're just, like, searching for an answer. You can see it on their face.
2759000	2761000	You know I always bring snacks to share.
2762000	2768000	Oh, yeah. We didn't know that you were interested.
2769000	2770000	That's a load of crap.
2771000	2775000	A tear wells in Meathook's eye as she turns to the woods, crossing her arms.
2776000	2777000	No human role needed.
2777000	2791000	Why would you not invite every, every, since I met this, this little rat kid, everything that they have done has just made me want to be around them. Why in the hell?
2792000	2797000	What kind of organization are you running that wouldn't want to invite her? I'm mad at you, kid.
2798000	2799000	She is a perfectly good basement creep.
2799000	2807000	She's our little basement troll, and we're her surrogate fathers, and we love her. But I'm gonna guess your organization didn't invite her because of the smell.
2808000	2809000	Yeah.
2810000	2822000	You guys! That was the three nicest things anybody's ever said to me, or about me in my presence. I accept your surrogate fatherhoods.
2824000	2825000	Okay, get up off the ground.
2825000	2830000	Fish face, you're fired from whatever weird position you were holding for me.
2831000	2840000	Yeah, fish face, honestly, with your fish head on your human body, we didn't understand the age discrepancy, and we would like to ask you to fuck off.
2841000	2845000	Ghost fish face appears and is like, whoa, no, it hurts, Mr. Stark.
2846000	2853000	Wait, did fish face get murdered while we were out here? Anyway, we'll deal with that later.
2853000	2856000	You guys just murdered him out of your lives.
2857000	2864000	No, look, it's complicated. I never said anything weird about this. I just said I got his van and he raised me.
2865000	2869000	Zack, when you ghost somebody, you don't make them a specter.
2872000	2878000	Okay, well, if this guy doesn't have anything else to add, I think I got shit to drop in holes.
2878000	2883000	I would like to know, what was Hargrave's focus in this group? Did he ask questions of specific things to you?
2884000	2886000	Exactly, how involved in your group was he?
2887000	2895000	I would call him a core member for some time, as he used to work with a group of cowboys or something.
2896000	2899000	I'm sorry, he told you about his work with the cowboys?
2900000	2905000	Well, yes, because he was changing direction philosophically on how he felt about the unnatural.
2905000	2918000	Previously, his work had been to get rid of the unnatural, but now he would like it to be more in the light and be written about journalistically to show the people the truth of the world.
2919000	2920000	I think Shelley and Jimmy share a glance.
2921000	2924000	Yeah, Jimmy's maybe a little sad, but he pretty quickly hardens.
2925000	2926000	Gross.
2927000	2931000	He gets rock hard and says, we're going to have to kill Dr. Brock Hargrave tonight.
2931000	2934000	I can't say that I don't relish the thought.
2935000	2937000	Yeah, Dr. Shelley Blythe gets rock hard.
2938000	2943000	Did he ever say anything to you about happy cow farms? Holy cow farms.
2944000	2946000	Happy cat factory.
2947000	2950000	He was rambling at the last meeting he was at and he was talking about...
2951000	2953000	Was it about his co-worker? Did he eat him?
2954000	2958000	Did he say anything to you about eating a man whole and contentedly patting his belly?
2958000	2964000	Wow, no, I know nothing about that, but that sounds like a really cool scene.
2965000	2970000	I think that I haven't seen him for three or four days now.
2971000	2975000	Four days, looking back, that was when we had the last meeting and I saw him.
2976000	2984000	He was rambling when it was his turn to talk about some run of numbers and holy cow farms and something...
2985000	2986000	What was he calling it? It was...
2987000	2988000	Hmm...
2989000	2992000	It was in another language I can't remember.
2993000	2997000	They're literally scrolling through their phone on their photos and they're like,
2998000	3005000	Oh, I did take a picture of, yes, here and it's the words, it's words, it's letters.
3006000	3008000	It's A-N-D-E-N-P-I-L.
3009000	3010000	A-N-D-E-N-P-I-L.
3011000	3012000	That is correct.
3012000	3014000	Space and A was capitalized.
3015000	3022000	Space, capital Z-V-E, space, capital R-L-O-R-E-N.
3023000	3024000	Does that mean anything to Shelly?
3025000	3026000	Go ahead and roll German.
3027000	3028000	I got German.
3029000	3030000	Ooh, and I rolled a nine.
3031000	3032000	Nine on a 50.
3033000	3034000	Do you actually have German?
3035000	3039000	I really do. The anthropologist category gives you a foreign language.
3040000	3041000	And you picked German?
3043000	3046000	Can I, I want to pull back the curtain. Can I?
3047000	3050000	I called Zach and I said, Hey, this anthropology thing gives me two languages.
3051000	3052000	I don't think I'm going to need two languages.
3053000	3054000	And he says, take German.
3055000	3057000	That's why just now I was like, roll German.
3058000	3061000	And he was like, okay. And I didn't say anything.
3062000	3065000	Because in my mind that just adds up.
3066000	3068000	I'm sorry, now that the curtain's been pulled back, I can no longer participate in this.
3069000	3071000	Yeah, I quit. I quit. I was told nothing.
3073000	3075000	You didn't tell us what language to pick.
3076000	3077000	None of you called me during my workday.
3082000	3083000	Whatcha doing?
3084000	3087000	And in Piel, we love Lauren.
3088000	3093000	Hey doc, I only speak the tongue of the motherland, but not your motherland.
3094000	3095000	Mine, Italian.
3096000	3097000	What the hell does this mean?
3097000	3102000	German is a little rusty, but it roughly translates to...
3103000	3107000	It's like you maddle a bit and you realize that the spaces are in the wrong place.
3108000	3111000	It says, Andenpilsverloren.
3112000	3113000	Andenpilsverloren.
3114000	3114000	
3115000	3116000	Ten pills for Lauren.
3119000	3120000	Lost to the fungus.
3121000	3122000	Holy show, I don't like that.
3122000	3128000	It roughly translates to, my god, lost to the fungus.
3129000	3130000	That's a great band name.
3131000	3133000	What could that possibly...
3134000	3136000	Hey Fitzy, what do you know about the fungus?
3137000	3138000	Hey Meat Hook, do you know anything about the fungus?
3139000	3140000	Fungus? Yes, that sounds like Meat Hook's alley.
3141000	3143000	I know a lot of things about a lot of kinds of fungus.
3144000	3146000	Alright, go ahead and roll a cult, Meat Hook.
3147000	3149000	Oh? Where did we find this German?
3150000	3162000	It was taking a picture on Rowan Fitzpatrick's phone from the presentation that Dr. Brock Hargrave most recently gave four days ago at the...
3163000	3166000	That's right. I was paying full and total attention and that's why I was totally with you.
3167000	3171000	I rolled a crit fail on a cult.
3172000	3176000	Got it. Yes, you know all about being lost to the fungus.
3176000	3183000	So it grows on your toes if you don't clean them good, but if you grow it long enough, then that can be penicillin.
3185000	3190000	Yes, perhaps he was onto a penicillin. A new penicillin. Penicillin 2, perhaps.
3191000	3192000	Thank you.
3193000	3198000	That pursuit of scientific excellence he was lost to the fungus? Did he say anything about penicillin 2 to you?
3199000	3208000	I don't think he made it as far as you did. He just showed us that. I didn't know that it was German that meant something specific.
3209000	3210000	Where did he say it was from?
3211000	3213000	In his presentation, he did not explain the words he showed on the screen.
3214000	3226000	No, he said that someone was going to be Andenpils v. Rowan soon in this area and that he had narrowed it down.
3227000	3232000	This sounds like an amazing hip-hop concept though. Lost to the fungus.
3233000	3236000	It sounds like maybe his friend got lost to this fungus.
3237000	3240000	Yes, yes. Or maybe he got lost and now he has to eat his friends.
3241000	3246000	Either way, I think we might find more answers if we go up the tower.
3247000	3260000	Up the tower, yes. There's telescopes up there. We can drop these stuffed animals into the holes which is what, because I'm not real, the message that we had to follow in the first place.
3261000	3263000	Oh, hey Vincente. Very cute Bigfoot.
3264000	3265000	Which one?
3266000	3268000	Oh, I didn't see the smaller one there.
3269000	3270000	Thank you. You want to drop it?
3271000	3272000	I'd rather give them to my children.
3272000	3277000	Nope. Maybe if they don't do anything in the holes, you can grab them out of there. I don't need them after that.
3278000	3282000	You'll have a lot of time to get more gifts before you see them again because you hardly ever see them, right?
3283000	3286000	It's just a vibe I got. I didn't actually know that about your personal life.
3287000	3291000	Yeah, no, I have a lot of time at home alone to buy gifts for my children or whatever. Please.
3292000	3297000	Do they paint like I miss daddy during finger painting class when you see them finger painting?
3298000	3301000	No, they paint a lot of pictures of their mother. I have them this weekend. I had to get a sitter.
3302000	3314000	Okay. Well, let's hope this elevator works because it's a lot of stairs and you guys are not very good at that.
3315000	3316000	That was a one-time thing.
3317000	3320000	Well, we're not going downstairs. We'll see how we are going.
3321000	3323000	I'm much better going up.
3324000	3330000	Real fast, now that we know that fungus is on the table, can we just check around, make sure there isn't a giant mushroom?
3330000	3332000	There's fungus growing around the holes or something.
3333000	3334000	There's giant Mario mushrooms all over the place.
3335000	3337000	Yeah, growing out of each of these holes in the ground, no.
3338000	3339000	This fucking toadstool runs by.
3340000	3342000	Looking around, yeah, you don't see any mushrooms about, no?
3343000	3344000	Yeah, that's good.
3345000	3346000	Except for meat hook.
3347000	3350000	You notice some of the spikes on her jacket are actually mushrooms.
3352000	3353000	Just mixed in.
3354000	3355000	Don't eat that.
3356000	3366000	As you look at the spikes on her jacket, you see some of the patches on Meat Hook's jacket as well, and they are all about making the unnatural known to the world.
3367000	3372000	Oh yeah, you notice that? What you looking at? This patch is a good one. I made that myself.
3373000	3374000	Kid, it's probably time we had the talk.
3375000	3376000	I was dreading this moment.
3377000	3379000	Fishface and I had this talk long ago.
3380000	3381000	No, this is...
3382000	3383000	I handled it really well.
3383000	3385000	Fishface won't be bothering you anymore.
3386000	3387000	Nope, bye.
3388000	3390000	This seems maybe like a conversation we have at the top of the tower.
3391000	3392000	I think you're having this conversation as you...
3393000	3395000	I think Zach introduced the patches for a very specific reason.
3396000	3398000	As you're heading up to the top of the tower, this conversation is going on.
3399000	3400000	Are we walking?
3401000	3402000	Yeah.
3403000	3404000	I feel like if there's no power...
3405000	3407000	Yeah, there's no power right now. The lights aren't on, so the elevator doesn't work.
3407000	3411000	Because Shelly St. Blythe keeps clicking the button over and over like, please, please!
3412000	3415000	It used to take forever, even back in its heyday. It surely is on its way down.
3416000	3417000	Roll luck.
3418000	3421000	Dr. Shelly, it's not happening. If there's one thing I know, it's what buildings without electricity look like.
3422000	3423000	I rolled an 84.
3424000	3425000	Yep, no power.
3426000	3428000	No, it must come. Oh god, no.
3430000	3433000	Does anyone have any kind of engineering or electrical science?
3433000	3434000	Electrical science.
3435000	3441000	Oh, well, I am pretty scrappy. I bet I could shimmy up the lines that...
3442000	3443000	Don't say shimmy.
3444000	3447000	If you open the top of the elevator car, climb up on top.
3448000	3452000	I don't know if that's going to get you up any faster. That's like climbing a rope in gym class, you know?
3454000	3455000	Yeah, I mean, you could try.
3456000	3457000	Okay, I will try.
3458000	3459000	Athletics?
3460000	3461000	It's a 98.
3462000	3464000	Oh, I ain't gonna do it.
3465000	3473000	You are like part of the way up and like a koala, just like stuck, just chilling.
3474000	3480000	You're like, you know, in your heart of hearts, if you continue to go up, you can try, but it might not go well for you.
3481000	3482000	You might slide down and hurt yourself.
3483000	3485000	I gently allow myself to slide back down.
3486000	3488000	Looks like it's stairs for Meat Hook.
3489000	3491000	I place the stuffed Bigfoot below just in case.
3492000	3498000	You know, we have a lot of, we have a very different outlook on life philosophically, but I think you're going to be a good three dad.
3499000	3503000	Thank you. I already got eight of my own and I've done it a couple of times.
3504000	3505000	Yeah, I have two.
3506000	3510000	Meat Hook, I appreciate the effort, but if we must take the stairs, we must take the stairs.
3511000	3512000	Everyone roll athletics.
3514000	3515000	Or stairs if you like.
3516000	3518000	It really feels like that should have been a passive thing last time.
3519000	3521000	Yeah, it did feel like that, didn't it? And it should this time for sure.
3522000	3523000	Yep, I failed.
3524000	3525000	I failed.
3526000	3527000	I passed.
3528000	3529000	Jimmy piggyback ride.
3530000	3534000	I told you, off way the puppets if I'm going to give you another piggyback ride.
3535000	3537000	So, did Meat Hook succeed or fail?
3538000	3539000	No, fail.
3540000	3543000	You can go ahead, Morgan. You can go ahead if you'd like, but everybody else is...
3544000	3546000	He's just like jogging backwards.
3547000	3553000	Meat Hook, we did after it's time your three dads told you about the unknowable information you're about to encounter.
3554000	3555000	All right.
3556000	3558000	It's bad. All this stuff is very bad. You're right. It's out there.
3559000	3561000	Everything you know to be true is true.
3562000	3565000	I know it. This is not much of a revelation for me because I was utterly convinced.
3566000	3567000	Good work, kid.
3567000	3568000	Wow.
3569000	3570000	But here's the thing. Nobody else can know it.
3571000	3572000	What? Everybody's got to know it.
3573000	3574000	They're not strong like you.
3575000	3577000	The feeble little minds will break. Society will collapse.
3578000	3580000	Maybe that's what we need, to start a better society.
3581000	3584000	I know it feels like that's probably the case from where you are.
3585000	3586000	Urchin with nothing.
3587000	3589000	But we are all fairly comfortable men.
3593000	3596000	And that would be disastrous for us.
3597000	3598000	The status quo must remain.
3599000	3600000	It must.
3601000	3602000	It's the Delta Green way, unfortunately.
3603000	3607000	I quite like the life that I've developed for myself here.
3608000	3610000	You literally just play the worst people.
3611000	3613000	Who is your father Vincentian going to rob?
3614000	3618000	If people don't have any more money because they know about all this bad stuff.
3619000	3622000	Nobody will need to rob in this new utopia.
3623000	3626000	Everyone will have everything that they need because we'll all understand the truth.
3627000	3632000	Here's the real truth. As comfortable as we are, humans on their own can't fight these things.
3633000	3635000	We are quite fragile as individuals.
3636000	3638000	We can't even walk upstairs on our own.
3639000	3643000	I don't want to, yeah, I could push you all down right now.
3644000	3652000	Humanity's ignorance is what keeps them safe from the utter fear if they really embrace the truth.
3653000	3654000	That's right, kid.
3654000	3656000	You said it better than we ever could.
3657000	3658000	Everything I've worked for.
3659000	3661000	99 flights of the zeitgeist.
3662000	3668000	Here's the thing though, you can at least continue to discover what is true.
3669000	3675000	And share it amongst your, what's that little shack called that you live in?
3676000	3677000	The hold?
3678000	3679000	That's it.
3680000	3682000	You can tell everybody in the hold. You can make your zines.
3682000	3684000	That's literally all we're talking about here.
3685000	3688000	Well, she's been making these zines anyway, nobody reads it.
3689000	3693000	It gives me pause that you don't understand what we're talking about here.
3694000	3697000	Which is the real information, the truth.
3698000	3699000	She can make her zines about Bigfoot.
3700000	3701000	Right, yeah, just not this stuff.
3702000	3705000	I see, but I can talk about it with all of my dads.
3706000	3707000	You can talk about it with your three dads.
3708000	3710000	You can talk to us about anything, yes, of course.
3710000	3712000	And there's still a lot of truth to discover that I don't know.
3713000	3716000	I don't know why the stars aligned to show me zines.
3717000	3719000	I'm still trying to figure it out and you can help me.
3720000	3722000	That's the thing, when we move into the penthouse you won't just have to stay in the basement.
3723000	3724000	You can go up every night.
3725000	3727000	You can look in the stars and see the zines that they show us.
3728000	3729000	And look at the telescope.
3730000	3732000	And also, it kind of is nice to know what other people don't.
3733000	3737000	It's like, I have a lot of money and a lot of other people don't and that makes me feel good.
3737000	3745000	So you would share with me your privilege for me to be complacent about other people's misfortune too?
3746000	3747000	That's exactly what we're offering.
3748000	3749000	It's beautiful.
3750000	3755000	I'm so conflicted and yet the answer is definitely yes.
3756000	3757000	Okay. Welcome.
3758000	3763000	As soon as we get out of here we're getting you a real leather jacket, not this faux leather bullshit.
3764000	3765000	I made it out of tofu.
3766000	3768000	Yeah, it looks like it's melting in a number of places.
3769000	3770000	It definitely smells that way.
3771000	3773000	No, you can age tofu.
3775000	3781000	You can teach me this process once we drop these stuffed animals into the holes.
3782000	3784000	And maybe run into a mushroom man.
3785000	3786000	You got it dad three.
3787000	3789000	Hell yeah. Can I be dad one though?
3790000	3793000	I don't know. What have you got to offer for that position?
3793000	3795000	It is Shelly's townhouse. I figured he'd be dad one.
3796000	3797000	It's only reasonable, yes.
3798000	3800000	I'd be gun dad. You could be crime dad.
3802000	3807000	You're kind of right. I do have eight children of my own that I don't really spend time with.
3808000	3815000	So you can be the number one time spent child, but still there's not going to be a ton of time. I'm a very busy man.
3816000	3818000	Vincenzi's probably not going to be in your life a whole lot.
3819000	3821000	But the telescope will always have the telescope.
3821000	3825000	And I want to look around this restaurant for the telescope.
3827000	3834000	I follow closely because the distance that you've told me I must have makes me want you to be dad number one more than ever.
3836000	3840000	This is what Vincenzi has done with all his children and it makes him feel so powerful.
3841000	3844000	Keep them at arms length so that they want to be close.
3845000	3846000	Yeah, that's what kids are for.
3847000	3849000	And as scapegoats in case I get caught doing something.
3849000	3851000	That's why you got eight of them.
3852000	3854000	Exactly. I had nine. And now I got...
3857000	3859000	Hey, and Meat Hook, I got nine again.
3860000	3862000	That's beautiful. Let's look around this restaurant.
3863000	3868000	As you guys look around, what you do see immediately is Dr. Brock Hargrave walking up the path.
3869000	3870000	Thank God.
3871000	3873000	He's just been patiently waiting behind us while we have this conversation.
3874000	3875000	He's not in the zeitgeist with you.
3876000	3878000	He's been making little like asides.
3879000	3881000	Meat Hook, you can't know these things.
3882000	3884000	He's outside on the ground below?
3885000	3895000	He's on the ground below. He's walking up from the parking lot area toward where these holes in the ground are which are kind of directly underneath where you are but still within sight.
3896000	3904000	And he is walking up with two people and they are both on those like kid leashes.
3906000	3908000	Are they being dragged or are they leading the way?
3909000	3916000	They are behind but they are not being dragged on the ground but they are being kind of like forcefully led.
3917000	3923000	However, they both seem to be passive and just kind of like stumbling forward.
3924000	3931000	I would like to grab the telescope that I know is in here and aim it at them and then ask Shelley if he recognizes the people.
3932000	3933000	Do I? No.
3934000	3940000	God damn Hargrave, he's here. He's with two people. They have leashes and I don't know him.
3941000	3943000	I can see his big hat and shiny shovel from up here.
3944000	3955000	It's just like a man and a woman, they seem to be in their mid-thirties and they're just dressed normal like they were maybe out at a bar or something and now they're here.
3956000	3959000	Kind of stumbling lifelessly behind Dr. Brock Hargrave.
3959000	3968000	And as he's kind of walking up, he's not looking up or around, he's just looking at these holes. He's got his eyes set directly on these holes in the ground.
3969000	3973000	I really need to drop these in those holes but I don't want to spook them off.
3974000	3980000	I don't think that you should immediately notice that Rowan Fitzpatrick has been with you this whole time.
3981000	3985000	I don't think you should drop those down yet. Shut up. I think we should be quiet.
3985000	3990000	I agree, but I think maybe you're just saying those things about the Bigfoots because they're your toys.
3991000	3994000	Also, are you interested in three dads?
3995000	3997000	You seem a little way with yourself.
3998000	3999000	Hold on, you just let anybody be your child?
4000000	4001000	I don't want to be this kid's dad.
4002000	4004000	No, but they have to be exceptionally lost like this nerd.
4005000	4010000	No, Rowan is the worst. Do you hear how he doesn't use contractions?
4011000	4013000	The whole way we were walking back to you guys.
4013000	4017000	Is that true? I will not say one way or another whether or not I would use-
4018000	4019000	You fucking freak.
4020000	4021000	No inflection at all.
4022000	4024000	I would have in the past, but now I do not.
4025000	4026000	Yeah, shut up. You're so boring.
4027000	4029000	Meat Hook, you were so right about this freaking nerd.
4030000	4031000	Thank you.
4032000	4034000	Okay, well I am not going to leave even though I feel like I should.
4035000	4036000	Right, but your voice should leave. Shut up.
4037000	4038000	How high is this?
4043000	4044000	How high is the Space Needle?
4045000	4050000	It's like 25.48 meters.
4051000	4052000	Why?
4053000	4054000	That's not very tall.
4055000	4056000	That's a thousand feet.
4057000	4058000	It's like eight stories.
4059000	4060000	Yeah, it's pretty short.
4061000	4062000	So it's like a sad miniature Space Needle?
4063000	4064000	Yeah, it's a bummer.
4065000	4066000	It's the Las Vegas version of the Space Needle.
4067000	4068000	Even they, I think, have a pretty cool one.
4069000	4071000	If you stand far away in the picture, it looks bigger.
4073000	4076000	Giddo, when we get back down there, we're going to take one where you're holding it up.
4078000	4080000	Have you ever had your picture taken before?
4081000	4085000	I mean, like, one time somebody nicked a Polaroid around the hold.
4086000	4089000	Okay, cool. I didn't know if you knew that that steals your soul.
4091000	4092000	Well, yeah, obviously.
4093000	4094000	I never let anyone.
4095000	4096000	They only take pictures in my sleep, you know?
4097000	4098000	I can't stop them.
4101000	4102000	Did Fish do that to you?
4103000	4104000	Fish face.
4105000	4106000	What? That wasn't me.
4107000	4108000	Yeah, no, that was a guy named Ralph.
4109000	4110000	Hey!
4111000	4112000	Ralph, what the fuck are you doing here?
4114000	4116000	A lot of weirdos party at this tower at night.
4117000	4120000	How should we, should we go talk to him? Should we wait for him to come up here?
4121000	4124000	I feel that we've now located Hargrave. Wasn't that part of our mission? I think that now is the time to act.
4125000	4129000	Yeah, but I want to see what he's here to do. Can we hide and watch him?
4129000	4134000	As you all are hiding and watching, he walks up to the two holes that are empty.
4135000	4136000	Oh fuck!
4137000	4139000	And he takes his shovel that he has in his hand.
4140000	4141000	We should have dug in the other holes.
4142000	4143000	And he sticks it in the ground.
4144000	4150000	And then he pulls a pipe out of his pocket and lights the bottom of it.
4151000	4154000	An acrid smell begins to rise up toward the top.
4154000	4155000	He's smoking the crystal.
4156000	4158000	And he starts shaking his head violently.
4159000	4171000	He pulls out a syringe and he stabs it into the arm of the leashed man who already seemed out of it and is now swaying slowly side to side.
4172000	4182000	And Hargrave takes a deep breath as he pulls a bit on the man's lead and he positions the swaying man a bit closer to himself than the still leashed woman.
4182000	4189000	And that's when Dr. Brock Hargrave shoves one of his fingers deep into his own ear.
4190000	4200000	Wiggles it around and then puts that whole eerie finger into his own mouth wrapping his lips around the bottom knuckle and sucking.
4201000	4210000	When you all see the head of the clearly sedated swaying man do like a slow motion snap to attention.
4210000	4223000	And he reaches out toward the torso of Dr. Brock Hargrave who just stands there and watches as this dude scoops into Hargrave's abdomen with both hands.
4224000	4228000	Like he's doing the breast stroke or walking through a beat curtain.
4229000	4237000	And he crawls into the belly of Dr. Hargrave and disappears from view entirely.
4237000	4245000	What? Is this true enough for you kid? In fact this is just more of your anti-meth propaganda.
4246000	4250000	This Christian anti-meth propaganda.
4251000	4256000	That's a much sillier than what I thought happened in the kitchen.
4257000	4263000	He just got on in there. Climb on in my belly.
4264000	4266000	What was that fish face?
4267000	4269000	Goodbye. Goodbye.
4297000	4309000	If at some consolation I was thinking the same thing
4312000	4323000	I am now mechanization All my muscles work like swings
4328000	4331000	Is this something that would not affect me?
4332000	4334000	I think this is something where it's the end of the episode.
4335000	4337000	I knew that. How did you not know your cliffhanger voice?
