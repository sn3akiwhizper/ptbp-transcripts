Fuck, I've been going on way too long. Let me send it over to my luff in the fog, Wolf the dog.
264.00 573.00 speaker1  Come sit on Pop Pop's lap while he regales you with the weird stuff that happened and will happen in this shithole of a town and multiple other realities, live from 694.2 PTBP. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Roxy, who tagged that pretending part in an Instagram story. They write, The opportunity arose to send this message to the future via radio broadcast technology operated by the exceptionally smooth radio presenter Wolf the dog. So I decided to let my beloved Andy know that his cute little butt is the cutest in the whole universe. I mean universes. Also, my contention uniform just arrived from the future, although I'm not sure what the meaning behind the pink square with skeletons dressed as the village people actually is. Agent Roxy from the European Bureau of Chronologics in Athens, Greece. Oh Roxy, you know how to butter up a wolf's ears and soul, that's for sure. But I will not accept you talking of others' meat buns on this here show. The only thick ham hawks I want people admiring are mine. Damn, now I want to eat some hawks of ham. Time to fuse some clues. The truths get me loose like an amuse-bouche, it's the news. Last time, Drew Carey, Pages, Andrews reunited with John before taking off on the four-wheeler with Agent Trent Catt and the odd-looking Broken Tubed Radio, heading to Clinkers to find the hidden underground location of Gary, Harry, Mildred, Clara, and Drew's body. The two of them then walked across the water to Clark on the shore. Down in his secret underground laboratory, Keith Beans found the super unnaturally fucked up Tilly B. Mitchell behind the blast door, screeching and roaring like some sort of wild creature. Falling back, he stumbled upon a hidden compartment in the uneven concrete floor, revealing an odd-looking old revolver with glass tubes and a green light lit. Looking for other buried treasure, Keith found another small metal sphere, or ball, if you will. I'm honestly so shocked he didn't just grab this ball, y'all. I was so proud. But then, this dumb motherfucker starts chanting the spell he remembered was on the paper that fell out of Mildred Mitchell's pocket when he straight up NFL blitzed this old-ass lady. So Keith's body split open, discarding his metal bits before his human anatomy reformed inside and zipped itself back up. And with that, Keith Vigna Beans lost his goddamn mind. He walked over to the strange, old-timey revolver, found a massive, dusty cartridge in the cylinder, and pulled the trigger, triggering a blinding flash of light. Keith Beans came to the Old West. Contention in 1880-something. He saw the original Silas Cole walking down the dusty path towards town, chased him down, snapped his neck, and took his wrongful place as the founder of our beautiful, quiet little town here.
570.00 681.00 speaker2  If you put zeroes in between it... I just don't want that I think about showing you guys my dick every episode part in...
670.00 721.00 speaker0  There's plenty of this water teeming with fish left over, and now the streets are gushing with a fair amount flowing down into the storm drains. Clark, you were able to swim to the shallow shore safely. John, your partially metal skeleton weighing you down combined with a failed swim check led to your needing to be saved by the very woman you claim to not trust at all. Ann Love pulled you up out of the water, chanting, and she lifted you on top of the surface where the two of you walked, Jesus-style, over to Clark. I need you both to roll Sanity for witnessing this unnatural ability.
719.00 743.00 speaker2  Go ahead and lose 1d4 Sanity. Oh no. A 1.
735.00 747.00 speaker0  But since neither one of you did succeed, you both just lose 1d4, which for Clark was 1 Sanity, for John is 2 Sanity.
743.00 752.00 speaker2  So I'm at 16. I was wrong. I was at 18, not 20.
747.00 800.00 speaker0  Oh, even worse. Or better. Worse. Better? 1 or 2?
799.00 836.00 speaker2  Sure. If it allows us to walk on water, that seems helpful. Clark's heart sinks when she mentions the put people into walls thing. His face falls.
834.00 856.00 speaker0  What's it called? For the first time, you probably won't be able to just say it. You'll need to, like, read it off a paper. So, do any of you have- Oh, everything's all wet. I guess we'd need to find something to write it on first off. I'd like to search the area for-
855.00 858.00 speaker2  Ready, utensils?
856.00 941.00 speaker0  Go ahead and roll search. Continue. And if not, we're banking on this other guy to take care of things if he shows up. Who's that?
939.00 961.00 speaker2  Right. That's right.
955.00 1048.00 speaker0  And now that he's dead, it kind of seems like it is only through death that he may live. And so this guy is this like rogue dude with, he's got some sort of light in his mouth or something like that. And so therefore at the end, you know, he'll be able to come back and save us.
1047.00 1143.00 speaker2  Who are you thinking of? I know. I know he doesn't look like much, but he's scrappy. Kind of like you. He just knows the whole hell. He's real dangerous, too. He was the one doing all the fish magic. And he wants to kill a bunch of people to go back in time and stop all of this, which might put a kibosh on whatever you're working on. Huh. Hey, John, right?
1141.00 1155.00 speaker0  Yeah, did you use the radio?
1153.00 1173.00 speaker2  I've been a lot of things in the past few days. What do you mean by that?
1169.00 1210.00 speaker0  And why were you acting like you were my partner? I... You're just the body, but you didn't use the radio?
1206.00 1241.00 speaker2  Yeah, this is... I forgot I was deceiving you. Yeah, a vector.
1239.00 1253.00 speaker3  Roll humant.
1251.00 1285.00 speaker0  She looks the exact same. She's not, like, making a move of aggression of any kind. Okay, what do you remember? Sorry, I've never talked to one. Like, do you think you're human? And she looks at Clark and she goes, Oh, my God, he thinks he's human. John puts his hand on his gun.
1283.00 1292.00 speaker3  He's been with us the whole way along. He just looks a little different now, that's all.
1290.00 1318.00 speaker0  Like, I can kind of see... Is that... Was that already in, Kevin? Or is that part of you? Does your skeleton grow out? Like, does the ball make a skeleton for you? It's all part of me. I'm very curious. Curious as hell. You are special. You're extremely special. You wanted to be special. You're damn special.
1316.00 1323.00 speaker3  but that presupposes that you've run into him before. What do you know about him?
1321.00 1370.00 speaker0  That's why me and Kevin were... And Kyle were sent here by Jim to get rid of these balls. So there was this place called Cole's Orphanage that we had to completely get rid of, wipe out, take off any trace that had ever existed, anything like that, because, I mean, it was... It was a big issue, right? Because these people, they were adopting children, but they weren't fucking human. And so we were just trying to get rid of them, but the only thing that Jim said was, don't touch them. So we didn't.
1368.00 1391.00 speaker3  if you couldn't touch them? Just a thing that we've heard might work, but yeah.
1389.00 1399.00 speaker2  What?
1397.00 1450.00 speaker0  if you really want to think about it, whether or not he's actually your dad, but... Holy shit. They weren't babies, though. Yes, they were. I'm clearly impressed, but they needed to be taken care of at the time.
1448.00 1458.00 speaker3  If we went and got that book, ended up at Calm Comfy Campground, what happens?
1455.00 1487.00 speaker0  Like, best case scenario, based on what Maggie said, if we could actually get the book, then we would be able to either call for the Overseer, because we don't know whether he's actually gonna show up or not, you know? Like, it's not a determined thing ahead of time,
1485.00 1507.00 speaker2  showing up at the end of all things to, like, tie it all up in a neat little bow just seem a little too fairytale?
1503.00 1514.00 speaker0  No, he does not strike me as a Prince Charming. No. No, King, perhaps, but not a...
1512.00 1528.00 speaker2  I mean, most of those fairytales aren't really about good people either, but don't you think it's still pretty convenient for yourself that you'd just be able to summon this guy and he'd end it for you?
1526.00 1541.00 speaker0  I've been talking a lot. What is your guys' plan? If I wasn't here, what would you guys have done, besides, you know, your friend dying? We'd probably wander around
1538.00 1563.00 speaker2  until it was too late and everything exploded. That's...
1559.00 1587.00 speaker0  but based on our whole conversation that we've been having here, it seems like you want to get down into the bottom of the pond through that door to meet up with your friend. And if that's right, if you take me and show me the book, because I saw that weird face you made earlier, I think you might have an idea of where it is. If you can show me the book, I will get you through the door.
1585.00 1592.00 speaker2  Clark, she walks away with her back turned toward you.
1590.00 1603.00 speaker3  I don't know where the book is. She thinks it's at my house, but I mean, I've lived there for my whole life. I've never seen a book there that...
1600.00 1626.00 speaker2  Maybe I had my mind as a jumble, but yeah, I had a vision of Kacelle going to your parents' house, and Kevin found the book and didn't tell the others. I don't know what he did with it. She did tell us that Jim tried to make his own book when he couldn't find the one your parents had.
1623.00 1634.00 speaker3  So then, yeah, her guess is as good as ours. It could be at my house. I didn't ever see a book up there.
1632.00 1647.00 speaker2  that Adam Kane might be the person who knows the most about where that book might be. He seems to have been amassing a lot of supernatural bullshit underneath our noses this whole time.
1645.00 1651.00 speaker3  He knew about them and how to work them.
1650.00 1671.00 speaker2  I was like, I don't... Or the cat, rather.
1667.00 1692.00 speaker3  I wasn't sure what the helmet did until now I've got a hunch after seeing the things we did. It makes us see things. It's gotta be. of the van that was on fire, and then it disappeared. Hey, hey, you know, you just gotta let that go. I just...
1689.00 1703.00 speaker2  We're going to say that to him, and if he doesn't,
1700.00 1738.00 speaker3  I don't know what to do, John. We could maybe find the book with her and then jump her and take it. I mean, what if she's right? What if the whole thing is right? What if using the book that she finds calls what we think is maybe hold me down, and he's willing to help us because it's me? Old G's been a little weird around us, though. Oh, shit.
1735.00 1770.00 speaker2  to open in the future saying like, hey, come back right now to this moment? Yeah. Yeah. We'll really have to keep an eye on now. Also, things got real tense with Ann, and she's probably not going to teach us magic anymore. Wait, what is my alertness? Damn it. 80 on a 60.
1768.00 1774.00 speaker3  A 76 on a 70.
1773.00 1789.00 speaker2  No, you guys are good.
1783.00 1807.00 speaker0  As you say, I'm getting a weird feeling about Ann. You hear the chanting that has been happening behind your back this entire time that is growing louder and louder.
1805.00 1816.00 speaker2  Gwen Stefani.
1812.00 1835.00 speaker0  and she is holding it over her head, and she is coming down at John Lee Pettymore, the third skull. Because she's getting the jump on you, you're going to be at a negative 40.
1834.00 1878.00 speaker2  she's coming for my ball! And I try to artfully roll out of the way using athletics. Wait, I'm at, oh fuck, I'm at minus 40? I try to persuade her to stop. What's your athletics? and my metal plates to just take the fucking blow. Well, that was really close.
1876.00 1944.00 speaker0  to what you were looking for. And, Clark Bishop, think about what you're doing This knife goes directly into the top of your head, John Lee, and you feel your skull crack as you take nine damage, and blood begins to just gush out of the hole. How much, wait, how many hit points did you have? I had 20. Okay. Good, I just realized that, not good, whatever it would have been, but I just realized that we had a whole gunfight earlier that might have been an issue with nine hit points. and Clark Bishop, blood is spurting out of John Lee Pettymore III's head. Clay! since she already attacked this turn. Okay.
1943.00 1952.00 speaker3  She passes 43.
1951.00 1966.00 speaker2  Calm down.
1965.00 1974.00 speaker3  Does that end the combat? Do I need to talk to her now? No, it does not end the combat at all.
1972.00 1988.00 speaker0  You've got a large knife. I'd say yay long, about a foot long, and a good three inches of it are in you.
1985.00 2005.00 speaker2  being in my skull affects my mind brain.
2001.00 2040.00 speaker0  as a human function to... Maybe it's grabbed onto your brain to try to emulate empathy and emotion of some sort, or maybe that was in ball all along. You don't really know, but you know that in this moment, you can't really see straight because everything's wobbly, and you feel like you're gonna throw up, but you are not at a mechanical disadvantage currently for some reason.
2036.00 2059.00 speaker2  John takes the pistol given to him by Harry, and although he's wobbly, he plants himself with his robot feet
2058.00 2064.00 speaker0  Ten. Fuck.
2062.00 2080.00 speaker2  Clark knocked her to the ground. Yeah, he's like on top of her. As you blast through her knee,
2078.00 2131.00 speaker0  off kilter from where it's supposed to be. Her leg now goes down and then off out to the side as it kind of blasts those ligaments off that keep it where it's supposed to be. Oh, my God. And it hits an artery, and blood is just pouring out of her leg. Oh, no. and I've got Ramona on the desk. Hi, Ramona. Ramona, save us. Come here. There she is. and as she's doing it, she is trying to chant She passed with a 25.
2130.00 2156.00 speaker3  Fuck yes, Joe. Okay. Oh, boy. I want to grab the wound behind me that has now been inflicted. I'm trying to cause so much pain that she passes out. Holy shit.
2155.00 2184.00 speaker0  Holy shit. You did this.
2181.00 2202.00 speaker3  and knew that there was a wound back there, so he reached behind him blindly to grab it, and he wanted to clamp down as hard as he could just to inflict pain. That was his only goal. She screams out,
2198.00 2216.00 speaker0  that as you're looking right into her mouth, she's... One of her teeth breaks. Oh, my God.
2215.00 2248.00 speaker3  I just want to remind the audience I don't feel great about it as Joe.
2247.00 2296.00 speaker0  Roll firearms. She looks at you through gritted teeth and one of the teeth is chipped off and missing and then she's gritting. Another part of her tooth just cracks off and you watch the enamel flake off of the other teeth like peeling of an onion. God damn it. so you fucking know. She says,
2295.00 2298.00 speaker1  Non-human.
2297.00 2306.00 speaker0  You bastard.
2304.00 2331.00 speaker2  And he sighs and he shakes his head and he says, all cops are bastards. And he pulls the trigger.
2330.00 2333.00 speaker0  She crit succeeds.
2332.00 2348.00 speaker3  And I failed. Just a regular fail. An 81 on a 70. 55. She throws you off.
2344.00 2359.00 speaker0  I'm going to spend luck for Anne Love to take another turn and she continues chanting.
2356.00 2367.00 speaker4  John T. Fella! John T. Fella!
2365.00 2378.00 speaker2  These are cutting in and out.
2377.00 2389.00 speaker0  She's like, yeah, no. No big. Tell Murphy hi.
2385.00 2416.00 speaker3  Oh, this is not going how I planned it all either. Going into this, it was a debate about how we were going to, which place we were going to go. That wasn't.
2411.00 2451.00 speaker0  you feel the blade on top of your head slowly sinking deeper into your skull. Oh shit. This knife does 2D10 damage when it has the spell being cast on it. So I'm going to show you the roll.
2450.00 2492.00 speaker2  Jesus Christ. He's holding on. Is a floor dice a cock dice?
2491.00 2504.00 speaker0  What was the rule? If one falls off, you re-roll both. Oh, awesome. Okay.
2503.00 2517.00 speaker2  Thomas, there's a bug on you. I rolled a 64. It's like really old. How do you know?
2516.00 2520.00 speaker3  Kind of, yeah. It's wizened. Or it's really sick.
2519.00 2533.00 speaker2  It's a wizened firefly. But it looks wizened. It's like little chips of color have been flaked off its shell and shit. Oh, that's sad. What'd you roll? A 64 on a 70. Oh, yeah.
2531.00 2558.00 speaker0  You're going to be able to stay conscious, but you feel... Like the knife is all the way down inside your throat, even though you know that would be like wild if that was true, but it like hurts as you scream.
2555.00 2570.00 speaker3  We need an ultra violence tag for this episode.
2569.00 2581.00 speaker2  Maybe I'm the overseer. Maybe you've got one hit point.
2580.00 2604.00 speaker3  Roll firearms.
2603.00 2615.00 speaker2  Oh no.
2608.00 2695.00 speaker0  You look back at John Lee Bettymore and you see this shimmering as the knife is just literally moving further and further into his skull without anyone touching it. And then as he's screaming, you see it in the back of his mouth. And as you go to fire the gun. Yeah, just fumble it out of the holster so terribly wrong. Blood dripping down as if your head is a chocolate fountain. Blood is covering everything, including all over your eyes. So you're going to be at a negative 20 for any action you take that requires sight. Where was Anne Love? You're all just standing in murky, muddy water, splashing about. So the gun just fell to the point to where you can't see it in this murky, muddy water because there's enough water covering the grass in this area that it is even spilled over in the streets behind you. So she's just like at the edge of Bean's Pond. The overfull Bean's Pond.
2692.00 2705.00 speaker2  Like, crush her skull.
2700.00 2716.00 speaker0  She passes a 14 and he's shaking his head no.
2715.00 2728.00 speaker2  and falling into the muck.
2723.00 2754.00 speaker0  your head so that the top of the knife goes straight into the ground and just... And the body of John Lee Pettymore lies flaccid face down in muddy water.
2749.00 2757.00 speaker2  Do I need to be on call at all this evening or is that pretty much it for...
2754.00 2766.00 speaker0  Well, hold on, Joe. Take off your headphones. I'm off. Hey, how much luck do you have? 25. Fuck.
2765.00 2770.00 speaker2  You need 30.
2767.00 2794.00 speaker0  I was going to have... The ball could have popped out and I was going to have you control it. Okay. So that one only did one hit point of damage, so you get to keep your one hit point.
2788.00 2810.00 speaker2  It hits on a rock coming out of my chin and can't go all the way through.
2803.00 2835.00 speaker0  and so as it dinks in, it just right into the rock instead of all the way through, finishing you off. And you're still going to lay flaccid there and you're just going to stay on the call and we'll let Joe think whatever he wants to think, but you're going to lose 10 luck. I would suggest spending the other 15 during this. Can you show me the luck chart real quick?
2833.00 2839.00 speaker2  Yeah. And then four and then eight.
2835.00 2845.00 speaker0  And then after that, there's just adjusting any rolls. You can adjust one to one. For... Like if you rolled it...
2844.00 2854.00 speaker2  So up or down for... Gotcha. Okay. I've got to hit the restroom real quick if we want to keep Joe in suspense for just a little longer.
2853.00 2912.00 speaker0  Okay. We'll do one round with just him while you're kind of coming back. God, no!
2910.00 2941.00 speaker3  And I want to shoot again. Did you have a second gun? Did you have two guns? You gave it to Drew, who I realized... In re-listening to the episode, already had a gun. And especially now.
2940.00 2951.00 speaker0  God damn it.
2946.00 2978.00 speaker3  Clark's freaked the fuck out. Just saw John die. I can't help you. You fucking killed John! Why?
2969.00 2978.00 speaker0  across both corners of her mouth, lifting upward as she stares you directly in the eyes. No mind at all.
