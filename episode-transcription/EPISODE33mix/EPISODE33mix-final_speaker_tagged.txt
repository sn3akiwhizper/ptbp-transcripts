0.00 201.14 speaker0  What's up my babies, what's down, what's all around, what can never drown, it is me, a wolf the dog of course, and I'm here taking up all kinds of space on 694.2 PTBP, the greatest damn radio station that ever was. I've got an announcement here that comes straight from my producer, later today, following the release of this show. The second Patreon exclusive bonus episode drops for all of our honorary police officers. The whole cast, even some guy named Justin, got together and played an absurdly delightful game of Everyone is John. You can hear that, as well as our first bonus episode, another Q&A session, by following the link to our Patreon in the show notes, or going to patreon.com slash pretending pod, and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging $5 a month to keep the show alive. You know what keeps ol' Wolfie alive? It's that real shit, that good good, it's the fatherfuckin' news y'all. It has come to my attention that the boys from Contention are sitting pretty in the city, though not without tension. Rosemary convinced John Lee Pettymore IV that Marvin Glass would help them out in exchange for the strange gun-like invention they found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell immediately prior to her disappearance. Rosemary and Marvin Glass clearly had other intentions, leaving our idiot cop heroes in a sort of cage match to tension playfully referred to as the Juice Box. I'm not really confident on everything that happened next, but I will mention the deaths of all three cops from Contention. In a lucky ascension, the boys rose from necrotic dimensions, leaving my mind and belief in suspension, and now they are all in attendance at the funeral of Ari Manstein, the trusty co-worker whose name kept changing. But of course, you already knew all that, and if you did not, no condescension, there is a lot going on, almost too much full retention. But my mind is inclined to find that which will remind you to bump and grind and unwind.
200.14 211.38 speaker1  I'm coming.
210.38 264.46 speaker2  It has, actually. We've done individual sessions, but this is the first time we've all been in here, besides the Q&As, to play. I'm excited. Me, too. Oh, hey, so here's a freebie Q&A. Somebody on the subreddit had asked why it took us six months between recording sessions, and he asked, did we think the podcast wouldn't work out? And that's not the case. It's just that we had recorded so much before we started that that's how long it took us before we got any listener feedback. That's true.
263.46 266.46 speaker1  Yeah. Yep, yep, yep.
265.46 284.90 speaker2  Ballsy. To the wallsy. Yeah, baby. I don't think so, no. No, he's on the new one. Do I sound normal now? Hey, you sound good.
283.90 286.90 speaker1  You sound hot.
285.90 296.90 speaker2  ASL, Luke. Asked and answered. Twenty-five. All right, so. Baby. Baby. Oh, boy.
295.90 315.82 speaker1  Baby, Luke. Oh, no.
314.18 318.58 speaker2  the mommy Luke, who's the grandpa Luke? I think Joe is the daddy Luke.
317.38 322.08 speaker1  It's so obvious, yeah.
321.08 331.54 speaker2  That sounds right. I can drive with that. I definitely thought you were daddy Luke, but-
330.06 336.98 speaker1  So welcome to this podcast. You're in the shit. You are in Zach's.
335.98 355.96 speaker2  Part of his room.
348.08 512.04 speaker1  The three of you are in a cemetery in the city, along with many other funeral attendees. All the seats are basically full. There's still some people standing around in the back. You don't recognize anyone in attendance from contention. Other than Jan Manstein, Ari's mother, she's just popping in and out of everywhere, talking to everyone, shaking hands, kissing babies, doing the whole thing. And eventually everyone kind of settles down and she takes her place at the podium next to the coffin with the crawfish boil in front of it. And the smell wafts through the cemetery with the pungency that seafood carries. And she begins. You know, I think that I'm really glad that everyone is able to make it out. Glad's maybe not the right word, but I'm happy. I'm not happy, but this is, it's just good to see everyone. And thank you for coming to Ari's funeral. She was taken too soon from us in the fire that claimed the lives of many here in the city. And we are here to celebrate her life, really mourn her loss, but also celebrate her life but also mourn her loss. And really just, we're here to talk about Ari. And one person who doesn't get to talk about Ari very often, really come into the public often, I haven't seen him very much recently, but my ex-husband, Stan Manstein, he's here and he's going to say a few words. So thank you. the coffin area, there's some movement there. And a man walks out and he is wearing all white, he is dressed in all white shirt and pants, and his hands are behind his back. Following him are three men wearing all black tactical combat gear. One has a scar running under his chin across his neck, another has a Glasgow smile, and the third has a scar straight down the middle of his face.
510.90 515.60 speaker2  What was the first one again?
512.04 599.30 speaker1  He's got a scar running under his chin across his neck. And Stan has extremely long, unkempt hair. It's matted and tangled, and his beard is similarly pretty gross, actually. He's got a real Charlie Manson vibe going on, and he's got a weathered leather face. There's a small microphone on the podium, and he pokes it with his finger and you hear I think that's just how he was walking. Gotcha, they weren't shackled. Nope. Gotcha. English to you. And time slows to the pace of molasses. And inside all your heads, you hear.
596.34 602.12 speaker0  She was those things when she was a police officer.
599.30 636.68 speaker1  She was those things when she was a school teacher. Now we're going to do this in a round-by-round basis. And that was Stan Manstein's first round.
634.10 642.38 speaker2  So are we in combat with Stan Manstein?
636.68 647.88 speaker1  So technically, we're going to play this out in the combat rounds, however, you're willing
646.88 652.56 speaker2  We're free to do? You're welcome to do whatever you want.
650.64 662.56 speaker1  Are you willing to do whatever you want? I don't know. So I would like to know what the dexterity is for Jon and for Keith. 65 for Jon.
661.56 689.96 speaker2  60. Okay. You said time was slowing for me. Does it look like the crowd is slowed around me? Yes. Good question. Are any of them reacting in any way other than being still? I want to make my way toward the front. Am I moving at normal speed? Nice. How are them guards looking? Stoic.
688.80 703.88 speaker1  Making my way up front. Now for the reasons that listeners know and that some in the room don't, Thomas is going to let me know on paper what he is up to.
702.24 712.16 speaker2  So, Thomas, you're up. I don't have to write down what I do for this round because I just observe.
708.92 740.08 speaker1  I'm ready, but I'm just keeping an eye on everything. Keith? with studying it. The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.
734.60 773.68 speaker0  Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities, he became an inventor and made so much money
772.68 802.28 speaker2  Yeah. And I want to get to the edge of the chairs. And in the diagram, I'm to the center left of the podium. Yeah. And I'm going to let him keep talking.
795.92 819.36 speaker1  making his way toward the front along the right side of the map, which can be seen on
818.12 834.48 speaker2  So I'm like standing next to you? You're standing right next to me. Bubble gum tree. Bubble gum tree.
833.48 854.16 speaker0  Bubble gum tree.
853.16 891.12 speaker2  Yeah. Okay. That's super cool. arm to my elbow. I'm not like showing it to you, but you, you see it.
890.12 899.04 speaker1  Yeah.
897.28 913.22 speaker2  He just mentioned the black goo.
912.22 950.00 speaker1  a partner. town.
946.20 968.04 speaker2  Good, good fucking work, Zach, on making this so fucking hard. This is tight. Clark is going to keep listening. Okay.
964.10 983.44 speaker1  the map on our Instagram page and our Twitter page. It was made by Justin based off of a terrible drawing that I made. Keith, what do you do?
977.08 998.56 speaker2  We're both soaking in the information that we're learning from Manstein, and when you look over at me, looking a little closer, you see another giant scar on my forehead going down on my face.
997.56 1001.40 speaker1  Okay.
1000.28 1008.00 speaker2  Are they similar?
1006.32 1013.64 speaker1  intelligence for me. Joe rolls four-clack.
1012.64 1017.48 speaker3  That's a fail. Sixty-seven on a fifty-five.
1015.64 1040.74 speaker1  It doesn't remind you of anything. You're just mostly shocked that not only is he alive, but these scars also might explain And Keith, you are staring at Clark. He is staring at you. You're very near each other, right next to each other in fact.
1039.10 1047.22 speaker2  And that's what I do.
1041.74 1086.90 speaker1  At this point in time, you notice that the three men who are dressed in all black begin slowly converging on Stan Manstein, but they are moving at the pace of a high viscosity liquid. Got it. They're moving slow.
1081.70 1116.06 speaker0  But then some good people disappeared, a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader, the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared. weird paranoid figurehead. Awesome.
1115.06 1164.42 speaker1  All right. Go ahead and roll 1d10 for damage. The smell of crawfish fills the air and time is slow and this man is speaking to you in your head in this odd spell-like cadence. You pull out your firearm and you shoot at Stan Manstein and you hit him directly in the chest. Time immediately picks back up. Thomas.
1161.82 1172.70 speaker2  of one of those guys converging on Stan right now. That's a miss.
1171.70 1184.34 speaker1  Yeah.
1182.94 1232.58 speaker2  the ground deck. You let him, Zach.
1226.90 1233.98 speaker1  time at the bar in the Marvin Glass cage fighting den emporium.
1232.58 1237.78 speaker2  We got real close. Uh-huh.
1234.98 1258.62 speaker1  Yeah, I believe he killed you. I think so. He fires and misses into this crowd. Keith, it is your turn. screaming and panicking.
1253.94 1263.46 speaker2  Once, I mean this boom, boom, I pull my gun out and aim for one of the security officers as well. Are you just aiming this round or are you going to fire? I'm firing.
1262.46 1267.84 speaker1  All right.
1266.84 1273.58 speaker3  That's a three.
1272.58 1287.30 speaker1  Powerful gun. Rolled 2D10 for damage on that small powerful gun. Wait, what? 2D10.
1286.30 1296.38 speaker2  Oh.
1295.32 1344.18 speaker1  goes down. You don't know that he's dead, but he definitely goes down. On the ground. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You knock him right on his back. Keith, the guard that you shot hits the ground and immediately you all hear three gunshots echo out from around you. You don't know quite where they came from, but you see the body that is on the ground flops three times and then lays completely flat and it looks like someone finished off this guy in all black completely dead, just offed him. The first one turns around and tries to grapple Kevin who is behind him and I'm going to need you to roll unarmed combat for me, Thomas.
1343.18 1386.82 speaker2  Okay. Haha. 25 out of 40. Okay. Haha. No, I get down low and lean into him with my shoulder, like my left shoulder and just kind of flip him over my back. And is it my turn or is that just a reaction? No, it's just a reaction.
1380.46 1391.94 speaker1  The other one actually is running toward you as well and rolled a 100.
1390.94 1418.94 speaker2  Haha. Ow. So what actually... What does he do? He rolls a 100.
1413.14 1449.70 speaker1  As it begins to fly off, it actually flies cattywampus and goes behind him, wrapping around his legs and he falls and hits the ground and he is currently like hogtied basically by his own trip wires. I say eat shit, Inspector Gadget. the strength to go on, but for at least this round, he is unable. Clark, it is your turn.
1446.66 1454.98 speaker3  So one guy is hogtied on the ground, what's the other guy doing?
1453.90 1464.86 speaker1  over his shoulder. Go ahead and roll firearms for me.
1463.86 1472.30 speaker3  I pass.
1471.30 1486.68 speaker2  I saw 0. I'm like hell yeah.
1480.42 1500.44 speaker1  So when you fire into him, he steps backward with the weight of the bullets ripping through his skin and as he falls backward, you see blood begin to pour out of the holes that you have put in him and he is lying on the ground. It is John's turn.
1499.44 1503.36 speaker2  Yeah. He's right there.
1501.44 1506.88 speaker1  You get a plus 20 on your shot right now.
1505.88 1525.82 speaker2  Not the hogtied one. The one who I flipped over my shoulder. So straight up, just two in the chest, one in the head, like I just try to end him. Oh, 78 on a 60.
1520.48 1534.06 speaker1  As you move your gun into position to fire on him, he freaks out and flexes and he moves your arm out of the way and you fire into the ground right next to his head.
1531.46 1535.06 speaker3  Because he gave you a plus 20, which would make you pass.
1534.06 1566.82 speaker2  Oh, yeah.
1562.06 1575.58 speaker1  And batting number two, this man, this large, large man who you just took to the ground is also dead. It is now Keith's turn.
1574.58 1577.86 speaker2  Okay.
1575.58 1582.26 speaker1  Go ahead and roll first aid for me.
1581.26 1586.70 speaker2  All right. Roll a D4 for me.
1585.70 1587.70 speaker1  That is a four.
1586.70 1589.70 speaker2  Nice.
1588.70 1594.18 speaker1  Describe what you do.
1593.18 1596.18 speaker2  Not really. No.
1595.18 1598.98 speaker3  Plug them up.
1597.98 1615.52 speaker2  He rolled a four. It works.
1611.92 1619.92 speaker1  as if he has taken adrenaline into his bloodstream.
1615.52 1630.56 speaker2  The pain from me doing that is definitely waking him up.
1623.88 1675.80 speaker1  And with that being done, he looks up at you and he is about to speak when you hear three more gunshots fire. I know. Woo. Yeah. and hit right above his ribs going through his back, and you lose five hit points. Spaghetti-o's. Okay.
1674.68 1680.16 speaker2  Which scar does he have?
1679.16 1687.20 speaker1  This is the one that is all the way- It's not the Glasgow. Glasgow smile is the one that you just killed. Hell yeah. For sure.
1686.20 1703.16 speaker2  Yeah, fuck that guy. Is it a Glasgow? The Willhelm scream. Isn't it something else though? What I mean is isn't the scars coming out from the mouth a different town smile?
1702.16 1705.16 speaker1  I'm going to Google it. It's not.
1704.16 1707.16 speaker2  Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
1705.16 1723.16 speaker3  You want to know how I got these scars?
1722.16 1795.18 speaker1  Wait, wait. pulls out a firearm from his spot laying on the ground and he fires it Clark Bishop. Doing eight damage. Holy shit. So he hits you in the chest and one of the arms and maybe the leg as well and you begin bleeding quite profusely and quickly. What hit points are you at now? 18. All right. slow down and you hear the screams of the people. The pace of molasses. The screams of the people who are in the funeral not 30 seconds ago as they're making their way back to the parking lot at an absurd rate. All right. No longer absurd. Oh, also very absurd just in the opposite way. Yeah, absurdly slow now they're running.
1794.18 1800.18 speaker2  It's so dangerous.
1797.44 1822.18 speaker1  You hear his voice in your head say, Neither was Cornelius Beans.
1820.18 1836.18 speaker0  Mine is now definite.
1835.18 1843.18 speaker2  That time, Dick.
1842.18 1850.18 speaker4  Sane as fuck. Oh, shit. I'm going insane.
1849.18 1857.18 speaker3  And what's your power?
1855.18 1872.18 speaker2  My power is 50. All right.
1866.18 1889.18 speaker3  charging at the guy who had his legs hogtied on the ground. I'm rushing him and doing whatever I can to kill him. All right.
1888.18 1914.18 speaker1  All right. And roll a D10 for me. A seven. With him being already on the ground fully hogtied and you sprinting toward him, I think it's perfectly acceptable for you to end this man's life on this turn if you want to describe that. It's legal, baby.
1913.18 1936.18 speaker3  running. And even as I come to a stop over his body, I just keep firing into his head, maybe screaming.
1933.18 1971.18 speaker1  are flying and all these sparks are flying around. And this man's, I mean, not a man, it's like an android head just kind of like peels open to all the bullets that are flying through it. Something has exploded in it from the inside almost the way it peels out in every single direction of skin and viscera and metal and wires.
1970.18 1979.18 speaker2  It's pretty minor.
1976.18 1990.18 speaker3  Lee Pettymore, were they from the guy on the ground? I thought we had an unknown assailant still shooting at us. I'm glad I clarified.
1989.18 2000.18 speaker2  I think my question is related to that.
1996.18 2004.18 speaker1  earlier, and he sees absolutely nothing.
2002.18 2013.18 speaker2  So we're no longer in combat. What do we see when we look around?
2010.18 2042.18 speaker1  The fog has slightly dissipated in this cemetery. The smell of crawfish is still potent as ever. The people who are attending this funeral are gone. The only bodies standing around are Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, Kevin, and the corpses of these large men who are half robot, half human.
2040.18 2057.18 speaker2  Ari is actually in there. As you do this, I walk up next to Kevin and stand there.
2056.18 2064.18 speaker3  Yeah. Keith, what are you doing?
2063.18 2066.18 speaker2  I'm just listening.
2065.18 2069.18 speaker4  Kevin looks at you. He says, bubblegum tree.
2068.18 2081.18 speaker2  How do you know that word? How do you know that word? Who are you? I'm Clark Bishop.
2080.18 2086.18 speaker3  Keith, why are you alive? I kind of know why Keith's alive.
2085.18 2091.18 speaker4  I'm a little bit.
2086.18 2098.18 speaker3  Maybe you could tell me then because I don't know.
2097.18 2135.18 speaker4  Bubblegum tree. Bubblegum tree. What's Keith doing with his weapons? Everybody bubblegum tree and let's put our guns down. Is that all right? Yeah, we could tell you were authentic, Keith.
2132.18 2153.18 speaker2  wearing my contention PD uniform. I'm wearing a way too small orange polo and three times too big teal frat boy pants and Sperry's.
2151.18 2165.18 speaker3  I actually, yeah, I knew that as well. Yeah, so I. It was very in character as far as I was concerned.
2162.18 2170.18 speaker2  Right into your Sperry's. Right into my big, big old pocket. All right.
2168.18 2178.18 speaker4  Now that we've all bubble gum treed, let's talk about what's happened to us in the preceding 12 hours.
2177.18 2207.18 speaker3  He's right in front of you. Yeah, he's. And I turn. He's turned his head. Keith, do you know this guy? Do you remember who he is? We saw him. He killed me. Clark goes back for his gun.
2206.18 2241.18 speaker2  The Glass family.
2240.18 2245.18 speaker4  Listen.
2244.18 2256.18 speaker3  Right? Yeah.
2255.18 2293.18 speaker4  individual. Clark. This is going to be hard to explain. Basically, my daddy, whom I thought was slain by the DEA on his weed farm, turns out he was just lobotomized and he's been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while now. And when I died, turns out I wasn't John Lee Pettymore. I was some kind of alien squid being or something. But I sucked out of my brain and I left my body and I went into his.
2292.18 2306.18 speaker3  Squid something? What was that? Or mechanical. I don't really know.
2304.18 2311.18 speaker4  And now I'm him.
2310.18 2335.18 speaker3  Clark doesn't. Oh, I know. Okay. Me and John. We got called out and we were in a suburban neighborhood. Yeah. And something terrible happened. Can you tell me what the terrible thing that happened with the vacuum? Yeah.
2334.18 2342.18 speaker4  Yeah. Yeah.
2340.18 2366.18 speaker3  And I hugged you in front of me. Watch my scars. Watch my scars.
2363.18 2374.18 speaker4  He hugged a little harder than Clark Bishop ever would.
2371.18 2393.18 speaker3  I kind of whisper in your ear as I'm hugging you. Maggie's alive. Chief's alive.
2390.18 2449.18 speaker4  Hey man, here's an ocean. Do you know what I saw? whispering some shit over that body. These two weird brothers kind of distracted me from investigating further, but there was Is this the same Maggie? You know, it's Maggie. Is it our Maggie?
2446.18 2454.18 speaker3  We talked about her and me.
2452.18 2486.18 speaker4  And I draw my gun. I'm just kidding. Oh shit.
2484.18 2499.18 speaker3  where my heart should be. You can see through it. It says if I had a piercing there, like the skin is all healed around it. Yeah. I stick my fist through there.
2498.18 2504.18 speaker4  I did that too, John. It feels weird.
2502.18 2512.18 speaker3  I don't, I don't have a heart.
2509.18 2515.18 speaker4  My weakness was I didn't have a daddy, but now I am a daddy. So I think we're just getting stronger.
2514.18 2520.18 speaker3  I'm happy for you. I think. I mean, my back is sore.
2519.18 2532.18 speaker4  My knees kind of hurt. My penis is not as big, but it's not broken.
2530.18 2544.18 speaker3  I felt like a million bucks. I got shot too.
2541.68 2562.18 speaker1  disadvantage for you, apparently.
2555.18 2590.18 speaker3  into Maggie and John, I got to tell you, I'm, I'm working for some people now. John rolls his eyes. Kevin. are? The mill.
2589.18 2601.18 speaker4  That makes sense. We didn't get to that. Well, Maggie, does she have a foot?
2600.18 2608.18 speaker1  Okay.
2606.18 2611.18 speaker3  That, that seems like a thing you would have observed.
2610.18 2633.18 speaker4  Wait, hold on. Good. You need, you need both feet and nobody wants a feet getting it. I said it two times. Am I going to say it again? Getting it.
2631.18 2639.18 speaker1  boil in front of the coffin?
2638.18 2648.74 speaker3  Yeah. I was going to say, do you, wait, okay, hang on. How was I pointed Keith? How's he alive? Okay. You remember Charlie?
2645.62 2651.74 speaker4  Uh, Charlie was Rosemary's partner. Charles Donovan. Charles.
2650.74 2653.74 speaker3  Yeah.
2652.74 2729.98 speaker4  Yeah. She was kind of freaked out that Charles died. She told me that today, but Keith has the same scars. What all of us have. He shoots the web, right? Nevermind. Oh, so we don't seem to have, we don't, we're not inspector gadgets, but it seems like we have some combat, some body modifications. I think of some variety of my variety of Rosemary's variety, but not of the robot variety.
2728.76 2743.38 speaker3  I try to shoot my hand again.
2738.54 2749.26 speaker1  However, when you, when you look at some of the wounds that you have taken, there is some metal underneath your skin in some places.
2748.26 2754.46 speaker3  What about this tink?
2753.46 2755.46 speaker4  I see it.
2754.46 2758.14 speaker3  Perhaps some you're shiny.
2757.14 2763.34 speaker4  I'm not sure.
2761.70 2770.58 speaker1  That's all metallic. That's cool.
2769.58 2791.02 speaker3  Let's talk to that's Brent.
2787.66 2800.00 speaker1  who is at the crawfish station.
2795.42 2817.10 speaker2  I'm hurting my hands cause they're still in the, like whoever was running this crawfish boil is long gone. So I'm just like quickly dipping my hand into the boiling crawfish water and grabbing crawfish and just slamming them into my mouth. It's our key.
2816.10 2818.54 speaker4  It's him.
2817.54 2866.78 speaker2  Yeah. The proof is there. on my face and just spices and everything. Cause I mean, you guys were talking over there for a minute, so I was just going to town on this.
2865.78 2880.62 speaker1  I'm zero.
2879.62 2904.58 speaker2  All right. That's going to end like six months. Yeah.
2902.54 2911.46 speaker3  know who, who, who this is? And I gestured to the guy standing there with us.
2910.46 2919.86 speaker2  That's Marvin's body.
2916.86 2937.10 speaker4  I'm like, I know what you did to my Smokies.
2932.08 2973.16 speaker2  When you said bubblegum tree, I thought maybe John Lee Pettymore had told you to say that, And I look at Clark and I look over at John Lee Pettymore and just a big, big smile comes across my face.
2970.80 3017.44 speaker4  I learned a little bit. Marvin Glass. This is all some business play to him. He wants to demolish contention so we can have a land. At least it's what I extrapolated from what I heard, but we're not done yet boys. We got to save the town. Also now I'm in another body.
3016.44 3020.98 speaker2  it. What's she doing?
3019.44 3041.66 speaker4  Well, how's she?
3037.68 3077.60 speaker3  running into you guys again, a freaked out in this and anything like that is washing away from my face and it's mortal terror as I describe. We got to stop it. I start to, I start to cry a little bit. It, it wants, it wants this.
3075.16 3083.16 speaker2  hard and I'm like, just tell us what you saw.
3079.74 3147.84 speaker3  It's a Maggie works for a group. I, I work for a group now. It's their only mission is to make it make what I saw not be a thing and boy, if you'd got seen it too, you would have, you would have jumped. You would have jumped when they said jump. And that's what I've been doing. That's what I'm doing now. She told me I had to kill him. So I, I came up here out, I shot him as soon as I saw him. Maggie told Maggie told me that, uh, killing Stan would help help make that thing not be a thing. So I did. Do you trust Maggie? to do whatever the hell it wanted.
3144.30 3176.66 speaker2  the glass family is going to be very angry at me. Yeah. And the reason I'm still alive is because of the glass family. They're going to be gunning for me. I died.
3175.66 3228.46 speaker4  It was creepy though. I think, I think there's metal things. Pretty cool. I'm like Sam Elliott and roadhouse. I'm me-o.
3225.42 3232.24 speaker2  I'm like, I got a pretty sexy upgrade. I'll tell you about that later.
3231.24 3247.46 speaker4  Nope. What sorts? You're being shut up. You're being mysterious.
3245.08 3267.62 speaker2  to him for rebuilding me. So I'm on your guys's side, but we might have some trouble coming after us.
3264.26 3292.26 speaker4  I don't know if anybody knows who I was shooting at, but I might be able to. the leg or something, I might be able to go back and infiltrate the glass organization.
3285.00 3320.12 speaker3  I asked her if I could bring you guys into the fold and she says she would trust me. And if I trusted her and that if I thought you guys could handle it, she's offered to put me up in the middle. She says she could protect me. seen the same things I had.
3317.84 3345.14 speaker2  to him for questioning. Now that that is not an option, I became a cop for a reason. I want to do good by people. And if you think that is the option that is good, I fully want to join you.
3341.96 3351.76 speaker4  With or without you, Glass is going to be after us. That doesn't put any more burden on our shoulders, I don't think. Yeah.
3350.76 3356.00 speaker2  Hey, come on.
3353.76 3370.10 speaker4  Let's go kill Marvin Glass. Marvin Glass is going to be after all of us.
3365.58 3376.90 speaker2  We've been a team for so long, why stop being a team now?
3375.90 3380.58 speaker4  I wrote that.
3379.30 3386.50 speaker2  So I always liked you, Clark.
3381.58 3404.28 speaker3  Well, I guess here's what I'll tell you is that Maggie, she told me that this was my mission for today and that after I completed it, I could kind of do what I needed to for a while. She actually told me to get my affairs in order and contention so that I could move up to the mill with them. So I got some time. I could touch base with her.
3401.88 3422.80 speaker2  Because guys, I haven't told you this yet. I had tens of missed calls from Drew and a voicemail that basically said, get as far away from contention as you can.
3418.06 3432.72 speaker3  and things that we confiscated from my garage and I was going to just move shop up to the mill. Get objects and whatnot.
3430.72 3455.70 speaker2  It's not in there anymore. I don't know where the gun is. Yeah. I brought it with me cause I thought maybe around, you know, I think one o'clock it might be working, but it's not in there anymore. And the gun's gone too. It's not in there anymore.
3452.30 3457.70 speaker3  We brought it up to the meeting, so it's whoever was in that room. Right?
3456.70 3484.76 speaker2  Yeah. That's right. But the camera, it's not in there anymore. Right. We might need to run back to the police station and your house to get all this stuff, but I'm really fingers crossed hoping that at least the helmet and the jukebox is still there. The radio.
3480.44 3487.76 speaker4  hands to his head and his eyes just kind of go white.
3486.76 3489.76 speaker3  John. John. John. How can you have enough drowning out All I know is there's no more to go
