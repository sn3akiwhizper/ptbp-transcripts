0	8480	What's up my babies, what's down, what's all around, what can never drown, it is me,
8480	17500	a wolf the dog of course, and I'm here taking up all kinds of space on 694.2 PTBP, the greatest
17500	20400	damn radio station that ever was.
20400	25900	I've got an announcement here that comes straight from my producer, later today, following
25900	27460	the release of this show.
27460	34420	The second Patreon exclusive bonus episode drops for all of our honorary police officers.
34420	40580	The whole cast, even some guy named Justin, got together and played an absurdly delightful
40580	43020	game of Everyone is John.
43020	48820	You can hear that, as well as our first bonus episode, another Q&A session, by following
48820	55380	the link to our Patreon in the show notes, or going to patreon.com slash pretending pod,
55380	62500	and becoming an honorary police officer by pledging $5 a month to keep the show alive.
62500	64940	You know what keeps ol' Wolfie alive?
64940	71580	It's that real shit, that good good, it's the fatherfuckin' news y'all.
71580	76900	It has come to my attention that the boys from Contention are sitting pretty in the
76900	80060	city, though not without tension.
80060	85640	Rosemary convinced John Lee Pettymore IV that Marvin Glass would help them out in exchange
85640	91040	for the strange gun-like invention they found in the possession of Tildy B. Mitchell immediately
91040	93520	prior to her disappearance.
93520	99660	Rosemary and Marvin Glass clearly had other intentions, leaving our idiot cop heroes in
99660	105780	a sort of cage match to tension playfully referred to as the Juice Box.
105780	115540	I'm not really confident on everything that happened next, but I will mention the deaths
115540	118420	of all three cops from Contention.
118420	125580	In a lucky ascension, the boys rose from necrotic dimensions, leaving my mind and belief in
125580	132700	suspension, and now they are all in attendance at the funeral of Ari Manstein, the trusty
132700	135860	co-worker whose name kept changing.
135860	141820	The officers' incomprehension must have led to some apprehension as they never once looked
141820	144900	into the reasoning behind the faulty memories.
144900	152100	But of course, you already knew all that, and if you did not, no condescension, there
152100	157060	is a lot going on, almost too much full retention.
157060	164460	But my mind is inclined to find that which will remind you to bump and grind and unwind.
164460	183860	It's Kudzu, baby, with no bat-o.
183860	194700	Got wind blow, hammer of the gods, guide us ships to new lands, how we come to tides
194700	200140	of war, Valhalla we are calling.
200140	201140	I'm coming.
201140	203140	Valhalla, I'm coming.
203140	209380	Guys, it's been a really long time since we've all been in this room to record this podcast
209380	210380	together.
210380	211380	It has, actually.
211380	215680	We've done individual sessions, but this is the first time we've all been in here, besides
215680	217900	the Q&As, to play.
217900	219420	I had forgotten about that.
219420	220420	I'm excited.
220420	221420	Me, too.
221420	223860	Oh, hey, so here's a freebie Q&A.
223860	228300	Somebody on the subreddit had asked why it took us six months between recording sessions,
228300	231380	and he asked, did we think the podcast wouldn't work out?
231380	232580	And that's not the case.
232580	236900	It's just that we had recorded so much before we started that that's how long it took us
236900	241100	to get to releasing an episode weekly and playing again.
241100	248220	It also took me a solid year to convince myself that I was ready for the technical
248220	254000	challenge of editing a audio show every week, as I've never done that before.
254000	260440	You were well up to the task, but it was a risk to record six months' worth of a podcast
260440	262460	before we got any listener feedback.
262460	263460	That's true.
263460	264460	Yeah.
264460	265460	Yep, yep, yep.
265460	266460	Ballsy.
266460	267460	To the wallsy.
267460	270900	Ballsy to the wallsy.
270900	271900	We still got it.
271900	272900	Yeah, baby.
272900	274900	That's what we do.
274900	275900	Oh, thank God.
275900	277900	Luke, you're not still on one of the old mics, are you?
277900	278900	I don't think so, no.
278900	279900	No, he's on the new one.
279900	280900	Do I sound normal now?
280900	281900	Shout a little bit.
281900	282900	Hey, you sound good.
282900	283900	Cool, thank you.
283900	284900	You sound hot.
284900	285900	Oh, baby.
285900	286900	ASL, Luke.
286900	287900	Twenty-five, male, Springfield, Missouri.
287900	288900	Not interested.
288900	289900	Asked and answered.
289900	290900	Twenty-five.
290900	291900	All right, so.
291900	292900	Baby.
292900	293900	Baby.
293900	294900	Oh, boy.
294900	295900	Baby, Luke.
295900	296900	Baby, Luke.
296900	297900	Oh, no.
297900	314180	Wait, okay, here, out of all of us, you're the baby Luke, who's the daddy Luke, who's
314180	315820	the mommy Luke, who's the grandpa Luke?
315820	317380	I think Joe is the daddy Luke.
317380	318580	It's so obvious, yeah.
318580	321080	Thomas is grandpa Luke and I'm mommy Luke.
321080	322080	That sounds right.
322080	323420	I can drive with that.
323940	324940	I definitely thought you were daddy Luke, but-
324940	330060	I love doing a podcast with my family.
330060	331540	So welcome to this podcast.
331540	333980	You're in the shit.
333980	334980	You are in Zach's.
334980	335980	Welcome, yeah.
335980	336980	Part of his room.
336980	341180	Welcome to the twisted world of Zach Reeves.
341180	343180	Doxed.
343180	348000	All right, so.
348080	355960	The three of you are in a cemetery in the city, along with many other funeral attendees.
355960	360480	Wait, no, I didn't go there.
360480	362040	I can't wait for the crawfish.
362040	364400	All the seats are basically full.
364400	367480	There's still some people standing around in the back.
367480	372160	You don't recognize anyone in attendance from contention.
372160	377920	Other than Jan Manstein, Ari's mother, she's just popping in and out of everywhere, talking
377920	383880	to everyone, shaking hands, kissing babies, doing the whole thing.
383880	388880	And eventually everyone kind of settles down and she takes her place at the podium next
388880	393880	to the coffin with the crawfish boil in front of it.
393880	400960	And the smell wafts through the cemetery with the pungency that seafood carries.
400960	401960	And she begins.
401960	405720	Oh guys, thank you so much for coming.
405720	411160	You know, I think that I'm really glad that everyone is able to make it out.
411160	413160	Glad's maybe not the right word, but I'm happy.
413160	417440	I'm not happy, but this is, it's just good to see everyone.
417440	422280	And thank you for coming to Ari's funeral.
422280	427800	She was taken too soon from us in the fire that claimed the lives of many here in the
427800	429040	city.
429040	435540	And we are here to celebrate her life, really mourn her loss, but also celebrate her life
435540	436980	but also mourn her loss.
436980	442100	And really just, we're here to talk about Ari.
442100	449940	And one person who doesn't get to talk about Ari very often, really come into the public
449940	456620	often, I haven't seen him very much recently, but my ex-husband, Stan Manstein, he's here
456620	458520	and he's going to say a few words.
458520	460940	So thank you.
460940	467080	And I guess the service will begin, or maybe it already began, but it's happening now.
467080	473720	And as she takes her seat, you see movement from the mausoleums, the tombs that are behind
473720	477500	the coffin area, there's some movement there.
477500	486120	And a man walks out and he is wearing all white, he is dressed in all white shirt and
486120	491180	pants, and his hands are behind his back.
491180	496800	Following him are three men wearing all black tactical combat gear.
496800	502580	One has a scar running under his chin across his neck, another has a Glasgow smile, and
502580	506200	the third has a scar straight down the middle of his face.
506200	510900	And they all look eerily similar and they're all tall and overweight.
510900	512040	What was the first one again?
512040	515600	He's got a scar running under his chin across his neck.
515600	522040	The three men stand behind Stan Manstein as he takes his place at the podium.
522040	526740	And Stan has extremely long, unkempt hair.
526740	532960	It's matted and tangled, and his beard is similarly pretty gross, actually.
532960	541200	He's got a real Charlie Manson vibe going on, and he's got a weathered leather face.
541200	546240	There's a small microphone on the podium, and he pokes it with his finger and you hear
546240	549680	a woom, woom, woom, woom.
549680	550680	What?
550680	551680	Nope.
551680	555120	Why were his hands behind his back did you say?
555120	556520	I think that's just how he was walking.
556520	557520	Gotcha, they weren't shackled.
557520	558520	Nope.
558520	559520	Gotcha.
559520	562020	And Stan Manstein begins to speak.
562020	578260	And as he begins to speak this full nonsense, you hear, through the noise, him speaking
578260	580220	English to you.
580220	586780	And time slows to the pace of molasses.
586780	589980	And inside all your heads, you hear.
589980	596340	My daughter was kind, hardworking, and good every time.
596340	599300	She was those things when she was a police officer.
599300	602120	She was those things when she was a school teacher.
602120	605300	She was those things when she was a historian.
605300	611700	You see, one long time ago, when this land was stolen and pioneer towns began to form,
611700	619680	Silas Cole was a miner in the mine that employed the town nearby of contention.
619680	624160	Now we're going to do this in a round-by-round basis.
624160	629960	And that was Stan Manstein's first round.
629960	634100	Oh my god.
634100	636680	So are we in combat with Stan Manstein?
636680	642380	So technically, we're going to play this out in the combat rounds, however, you're willing
642380	646880	to do, you're more than, you know, welcome.
646880	647880	We're free to do?
647880	649640	You're welcome to do whatever you want.
650640	652560	Are you willing to do whatever you want?
652560	654160	I don't know.
654160	659880	So I would like to know what the dexterity is for Jon and for Keith.
659880	661560	65 for Jon.
661560	662560	60.
662560	663560	Okay.
663560	666520	So we are going to begin with Clark Bishop.
666520	668680	I want to survey the crowd.
668680	670280	You said time was slowing for me.
670280	673280	Does it look like the crowd is slowed around me?
673280	674280	Yes.
674280	675280	Good question.
675280	678320	Are any of them reacting in any way other than being still?
678320	679320	No.
680000	681920	I want to make my way toward the front.
681920	683480	Am I moving at normal speed?
683480	684480	You are.
684480	685480	Nice.
685480	686800	How are them guards looking?
686800	687800	Stoic.
687800	688800	I'm making my way toward the front.
688800	689960	Making my way up front.
689960	697080	Now for the reasons that listeners know and that some in the room don't, Thomas is going
697080	701240	to let me know on paper what he is up to.
701240	702240	Yeah.
702240	703880	So, Thomas, you're up.
703880	708920	I don't have to write down what I do for this round because I just observe.
708920	712160	I'm ready, but I'm just keeping an eye on everything.
712160	713160	All right.
713160	714160	Keith?
714160	721160	I stay seated, but I reach into my pocket and have my hand on my gun.
721160	722160	Okay.
722160	728960	While down in the mines, Silas Cole came upon an odd black substance and he became obsessed
728960	730680	with studying it.
730680	734600	The substance was invisible to others, but not to Cole.
734600	740080	Exploiting the substance's wrong qualities, he became an inventor and made so much money
740080	743360	off of his inventions that he bought the mine.
743360	747800	He built an office on the top floor of the tall, skinny mining company building that
747800	750520	sat right above the mine itself.
750520	756320	He began to harvest the residue and acquired a much firmer grasp on its tendencies.
756320	759160	He invented wild, magical things.
759160	764360	Each new invention brought him wealth and power, but also released more of this inky
764360	766760	substance into the town.
766760	770400	Joe, what does Clark do?
770400	772680	I'm walking up the middle of the aisle.
772680	773680	Yeah.
773680	775840	And I want to get to the edge of the chairs.
775840	779880	And in the diagram, I'm to the center left of the podium.
779880	780880	Yeah.
780880	785520	And I'm going to let him keep talking.
785520	786520	Thomas?
786520	789280	Okay, well, I will write this one down.
789280	795920	Thomas has requested that I let the audience know here that John Lee Pettymore begins slowly
795920	802280	making his way toward the front along the right side of the map, which can be seen on
802280	807520	our Instagram and Twitter pages found at PretendingPod.
807520	812880	I see Bishop coming up and I look over and make eye contact with him, but I don't say
812880	813880	anything.
813880	814880	Are you, are you sitting?
814880	818120	I'm in the seat right in the middle aisle.
818120	819360	So I'm like standing next to you?
819360	820360	You're standing right next to me.
820360	822800	I put my hand on his, on Keith's shoulder.
822800	828120	I look up at him and kind of nod and then, Keith, what's up?
828120	831480	Is it bubble gum?
831480	832480	Bubble gum tree.
832480	833480	Bubble gum tree.
833480	834480	Bubble gum tree.
834480	840360	I feel a little more at ease knowing that you just asked me that.
840360	846280	So in the, in the fiction of the rounds that we're doing here, uh, he, Manstein would still
846280	853160	be talking while we're talking, but we, we're, we're synced in time.
853160	854160	Yeah.
854160	855160	Okay.
855160	856160	That's super cool.
856160	863240	I kind of squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze your shoulder, Keith, I'm glad you're
863240	864240	with us.
864240	865240	I am too.
865720	871600	We can talk about this later, but I've been, it's been an interesting day.
871600	875680	If anything happens, you know, I still got your back and I would hope you'd have mine.
875680	876680	I do.
876680	884580	And I, I scratched my head and you can see a scar going down from my finger, down my
884580	886680	arm to my elbow.
886680	889120	I'm not like showing it to you, but you, you see it.
889120	890120	I notice it.
890120	891120	Yeah.
891120	895040	Do you think we should let him keep telling this story?
895680	897280	I'm interested in what he's saying.
897280	899040	He just mentioned the black goo.
899040	903280	I am too, but I don't know if the public needs to know what he's about to say.
903280	904520	I gesture around us.
904520	906760	I don't know if they, I don't know if they know.
906760	912220	I just look back up at Manstein and to divert his raising paranoia, he began looking for
912220	913220	a partner.
913220	918400	He found a similarly intelligent engineer and his wife, Mary Cole, who could also see
918400	924320	the substance they began calling residue, but Silas Cole was scared of their inventions.
924320	929360	He became paranoid that other people could see the residue that was loose all over the
929360	930360	town.
930360	934680	Consumed, he believed the town was plotting against him, so he began kidnapping people
934680	937080	he suspected knew too much.
938600	940600	Clark, you're up.
946200	950000	Good, good fucking work, Zach, on making this so fucking hard.
950000	952000	This is tight.
953000	956480	Clark, Clark does nothing.
956480	957480	Clark is going to keep listening.
957480	958480	Okay.
958480	964100	John Lee Pettymore continues moving forward along the right side that you can see along
964100	968040	the map on our Instagram page and our Twitter page.
968040	973200	It was made by Justin based off of a terrible drawing that I made.
973200	974640	Keith, what do you do?
974640	977040	I look over at Bishop again.
977080	983440	We're both soaking in the information that we're learning from Manstein, and when you
983440	991000	look over at me, looking a little closer, you see another giant scar on my forehead
991000	992640	going down on my face.
992640	995560	Are they fresh looking or are they healed looking?
995560	996560	Probably pretty fresh.
996560	997560	Probably pretty fresh, yeah.
997560	998560	Okay.
998560	1000280	Would Joe recognize these scars from anybody he's seen before?
1000280	1001400	Are they similar?
1001400	1006320	Joe, go ahead and have Clark roll an intelligence for me, or I guess Joe is the one who rolls
1006320	1008000	intelligence for me.
1008000	1009000	Joe rolls four-clack.
1009000	1012640	I'll do it on behalf of Clark.
1012640	1013640	That's a fail.
1013640	1014640	Sixty-seven on a fifty-five.
1014640	1015640	Okay.
1015640	1017480	It doesn't remind you of anything.
1017480	1023140	You're just mostly shocked that not only is he alive, but these scars also might explain
1023140	1026680	his aliveness.
1026680	1029640	And Keith, you are staring at Clark.
1029640	1030640	He is staring at you.
1030640	1032700	You're very near each other, right next to each other in fact.
1032700	1039100	I'm just kind of shaking my head like almost mouth agape, just like, the fuck?
1039100	1040740	And that's what I do.
1040740	1041740	Okay.
1041740	1047220	At this point in time, you notice that the three men who are dressed in all black begin
1047220	1057300	slowly converging on Stan Manstein, but they are moving at the pace of a high viscosity
1057300	1058300	liquid.
1058300	1059300	Got it.
1059300	1060300	They're moving slow.
1060300	1066300	They're moving slowly, but they are clearly moving toward Stan.
1066300	1072380	The town was suspicious of the disappearances, but most of the ones gone were bad people.
1072380	1077260	The whole saloon staff, the bartender, Miss Kitty, the piano player, there was a few gamblers,
1077260	1081700	the town drunk, so they kept their heads down and went about their business.
1081700	1086900	But then some good people disappeared, a professor, a circuit judge, a rancher, a homesteader,
1086900	1090540	the homesteader's wife, then the preacher disappeared.
1090540	1095740	The town freaked out and they hired a roaming cowboy named Cornelius Beams to kill their
1095740	1098980	weird paranoid figurehead.
1098980	1099980	Awesome.
1099980	1103740	Clark, it's your turn.
1103740	1107420	I'm drawing my weapon and shooting at Stan.
1107420	1109360	Roll firearms.
1109360	1115060	That's a pass, a 43 on an 80.
1115060	1116060	All right.
1116220	1118860	Go ahead and roll 1d10 for damage.
1118860	1120460	A 5.
1120460	1123380	You pull out your gun in the middle of a funeral.
1123380	1127060	I mean, it's not a normal funeral, sure.
1127060	1134740	The smell of crawfish fills the air and time is slow and this man is speaking to you in
1134740	1139060	your head in this odd spell-like cadence.
1139060	1146500	You pull out your firearm and you shoot at Stan Manstein and you hit him directly in
1146500	1149900	the chest.
1149900	1153540	Time immediately picks back up.
1153540	1154620	Thomas.
1154620	1161820	You all would see Kevin from behind the stage firing from behind the stage into the back
1161820	1164420	of one of those guys converging on Stan right now.
1164420	1167940	Go ahead and roll firearms.
1167980	1169700	89.
1169700	1170700	That's a miss.
1170700	1171700	You want to describe it?
1171700	1172700	Yeah.
1172700	1182940	I totally missed the first guy, but I accidentally hit the next guy in the head and he drops
1182940	1184340	the ground deck.
1184340	1186780	Damn it, I say.
1186780	1187780	You let him, Zach.
1187780	1191540	It's canon.
1191540	1200820	Let's say the one with the scar on his neck.
1200820	1207180	I want to see how this plays out.
1207180	1213300	I can see in Zach's head, he's like, do I let him do this?
1213300	1216180	I like it so much, but it's not what happened.
1216180	1220340	It's not what the dice say, and 89 is pretty bad.
1220340	1226900	Keith Vigna, Clark Bishop, you both see Kevin, the security guard who you saw for the first
1226900	1232580	time at the bar in the Marvin Glass cage fighting den emporium.
1232580	1233980	We got real close.
1233980	1234980	Uh-huh.
1234980	1237780	Yeah, I believe he killed you.
1237780	1238880	I think so.
1238880	1242100	He fires and misses into this crowd.
1242100	1244060	Keith, it is your turn.
1244060	1251060	Oh, and also at this point in time, the audience freaks out and people all stand up and begin
1251060	1252940	screaming and panicking.
1252940	1253940	Yeah.
1253940	1258620	Once, I mean this boom, boom, I pull my gun out and aim for one of the security officers
1258620	1259620	as well.
1259620	1261460	Are you just aiming this round or are you going to fire?
1261460	1262460	I'm firing.
1262460	1263460	All right.
1263460	1266840	Go ahead and roll that firearms check.
1266840	1267840	That's a three.
1267840	1268840	Nice.
1268840	1272580	Ooh, roll a, are you firing, you're firing with your small.
1272580	1273580	Powerful gun.
1274100	1278300	Rolled 2D10 for damage on that small powerful gun.
1278300	1279300	15.
1279300	1280300	15.
1280300	1281300	Oh, shoot.
1281300	1282300	Wait, what?
1282300	1283300	2D10.
1283300	1284300	A six and a nine.
1284300	1285300	A six and a nine.
1285300	1286300	Oh, congratulations.
1286300	1287300	Oh.
1287300	1295320	So you fire into one of the guards wearing the all black and you fire into him and he
1295320	1296380	goes down.
1296380	1299700	You don't know that he's dead, but he definitely goes down.
1299700	1300700	On the ground.
1300700	1301700	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1301700	1302700	You knock him right on his back.
1302820	1309340	Keith, the guard that you shot hits the ground and immediately you all hear three gunshots
1309340	1311520	echo out from around you.
1311520	1316380	You don't know quite where they came from, but you see the body that is on the ground
1316380	1323340	flops three times and then lays completely flat and it looks like someone finished off
1323340	1327580	this guy in all black completely dead, just offed him.
1327580	1332380	It is the turn of the other two in all black.
1332380	1339980	The first one turns around and tries to grapple Kevin who is behind him and I'm going to need
1339980	1343180	you to roll unarmed combat for me, Thomas.
1343180	1344180	Okay.
1344180	1345180	Haha.
1345180	1347180	25 out of 40.
1347180	1348180	Okay.
1348180	1349500	You get the better end of him.
1349500	1353820	So as he comes running toward you, what do you do with his weight?
1353820	1358700	He is like six and a half, seven feet tall and quite wide and you can do with him what
1358700	1359700	you want.
1359700	1360700	Okay.
1360700	1362700	So he goes out to dinner and...
1362700	1363700	Haha.
1363700	1364700	Lucky?
1364700	1367420	You got a lot of man headed your way.
1367420	1375260	No, I get down low and lean into him with my shoulder, like my left shoulder and just
1375260	1377220	kind of flip him over my back.
1377220	1379100	And is it my turn or is that just a reaction?
1379100	1380460	No, it's just a reaction.
1380460	1386820	The other one actually is running toward you as well and rolled a 100.
1386820	1387820	Okay.
1387820	1388820	Nice.
1389220	1390940	He trips over his own dick.
1390940	1391940	Haha.
1391940	1392940	Ow.
1392940	1393940	So what actually...
1393940	1394940	Haha.
1394940	1397900	That's payback for the cage.
1397900	1398900	What does he do?
1398900	1399900	He rolls a 100.
1399900	1405100	Yeah, he rolls a 100 and as he runs out, he holds one of his arms out toward you like
1405100	1413100	you saw the giant robot man in the house of James the mill worker.
1413140	1418940	As it begins to fly off, it actually flies cattywampus and goes behind him, wrapping
1418940	1425620	around his legs and he falls and hits the ground and he is currently like hogtied basically
1425620	1427620	by his own trip wires.
1427620	1429860	I say eat shit, Inspector Gadget.
1429860	1432740	Let's go put him on the train tracks.
1432740	1440420	Stan Manstein is recovering from the shot to his chest and he begins to try to muster
1440420	1444980	the strength to go on, but for at least this round, he is unable.
1444980	1446660	Clark, it is your turn.
1446660	1449700	So one guy is hogtied on the ground, what's the other guy doing?
1449700	1453900	We got one dead on the ground, one hogtied on the ground and one that John has just flipped
1453900	1454980	over his shoulder.
1454980	1456740	I'm taking another shot at Stan.
1456740	1460460	Go ahead and roll firearms for me.
1460460	1462460	We might need Stan.
1462460	1463860	64 on an 80.
1463860	1464860	I pass.
1464860	1465860	All right.
1465860	1466860	Roll 1d10.
1466860	1467860	10.
1468300	1471300	I fucking knew you were going to 10.
1471300	1472300	I saw 0.
1472300	1473300	I'm like hell yeah.
1473300	1476300	I was like oh.
1476300	1480420	That's going to be enough to drop him fully, fully to the ground.
1480420	1486680	So when you fire into him, he steps backward with the weight of the bullets ripping through
1486680	1491900	his skin and as he falls backward, you see blood begin to pour out of the holes that
1491900	1495420	you have put in him and he is lying on the ground.
1495420	1496680	It is John's turn.
1496680	1499440	I'm just going to shoot the guy who's on the ground.
1499440	1500440	Yeah.
1500440	1501440	He's right there.
1501440	1503360	You get a plus 20 on your shot right now.
1503360	1505880	On the hogtied?
1505880	1506880	Not the hogtied one.
1506880	1508300	The one who I flipped over my shoulder.
1508300	1513160	So straight up, just two in the chest, one in the head, like I just try to end him.
1513160	1516160	Roll it for me, daddy.
1516160	1520480	Oh, 78 on a 60.
1520480	1525820	As you move your gun into position to fire on him, he freaks out and flexes and he moves
1525820	1529700	your arm out of the way and you fire into the ground right next to his head.
1529700	1531460	Are you 60 natural?
1531460	1534060	Because he gave you a plus 20, which would make you pass.
1534060	1535060	Oh, yeah.
1535060	1536060	I pass.
1536060	1537980	Oh, good looking out.
1537980	1540020	Hell yeah, Joe.
1540020	1541020	He's the best at it.
1541020	1545380	I forgot about the 20 you gave me as soon as I started talking.
1545380	1550820	So as you are firing into the ground, you get enough strength back in your arm.
1550820	1556940	The momentum of the gun firing carries my aim right into his heart.
1556940	1562060	Immediately into his head and heart multiple times.
1562060	1566820	And batting number two, this man, this large, large man who you just took to the ground
1566820	1568620	is also dead.
1568620	1570220	It is now Keith's turn.
1570220	1574580	I run over to Manstein and I want to apply first aid.
1574580	1575580	Okay.
1575580	1577860	Go ahead and roll first aid for me.
1578860	1581260	Got a 53 and a 60.
1581260	1582260	All right.
1582260	1584060	Roll a D4 for me.
1584060	1585700	Just for me.
1585700	1586700	That is a four.
1586700	1587700	Nice.
1587700	1588700	All right.
1588700	1589700	Describe what you do.
1589700	1593180	I go stick my fingers in his bullet holes.
1593180	1594180	Not really.
1594180	1595180	No.
1595180	1596180	Plug them up.
1596180	1597980	Yeah, sure.
1597980	1598980	He rolled a four.
1598980	1599980	It works.
1599980	1603440	In the city, that's what first aid is.
1603440	1611920	As you dig your fingers into his bullet holes, you see his eyes just light up and almost
1611920	1615520	as if he has taken adrenaline into his bloodstream.
1615520	1619920	The pain from me doing that is definitely waking him up.
1619920	1623880	It's enough to open those eyes right on up.
1623880	1630560	And with that being done, he looks up at you and he is about to speak when you hear three
1630560	1633000	more gunshots fire.
1633000	1635440	I know.
1635440	1636680	Woo.
1636680	1639960	And actually- I don't like when you say woo.
1639960	1640960	Yeah.
1640960	1652320	All right, so Thomas, John feels a just fire in his back as a couple of bullets graze through
1652320	1660400	and hit right above his ribs going through his back, and you lose five hit points.
1660400	1661400	Uh-oh.
1661400	1662400	Spaghetti-o's.
1662400	1663400	Okay.
1663400	1674680	There is one remaining man in black and he is very upset with the situation at hand.
1674680	1675800	Which scar does he have?
1675800	1679160	Oh, he's got this scar that's going straight down his face.
1679160	1680160	This is the one that is all the way-
1680160	1681160	It's not the Glasgow.
1681160	1682160	Which one was the Glasgow smile again?
1682200	1684200	Glasgow smile is the one that you just killed.
1684200	1685200	Hell yeah.
1685200	1686200	For sure.
1686200	1687200	Yeah, fuck that guy.
1687200	1688200	Is it a Glasgow?
1688200	1689200	It's a Glasgow smile.
1689200	1690200	The Willhelm scream.
1690200	1692680	Glasgow smile, it's the scars coming out from the mouth.
1692680	1693760	Isn't it something else though?
1693760	1697680	I think actually Glasgow smile is not a politically correct way of saying it.
1697680	1701160	What I mean is isn't the scars coming out from the mouth a different town smile?
1701160	1702160	Oh.
1702160	1703160	I'm going to Google it.
1703160	1704160	It's not.
1704160	1705160	Yeah, I'm sure you're right.
1705160	1707160	You want to know how I got these scars?
1707160	1710160	Was it Glasgow?
1711160	1713160	Yeah, okay.
1713160	1716160	Let's just take that part off the podcast, please.
1716160	1720160	Thomas being wrong on the podcast.
1720160	1722160	Leave it in, baby.
1722160	1723160	Wait, wait.
1723160	1727160	We're not friends if you leave it in.
1727160	1732160	The guy who would wrap the tripwire around his own legs who fell on the ground, he actually
1732160	1739160	pulls out a firearm from his spot laying on the ground and he fires it Clark Bishop.
1740160	1742160	Doing eight damage.
1742160	1743160	Holy shit.
1743160	1750760	So he hits you in the chest and one of the arms and maybe the leg as well and you begin
1750760	1754660	bleeding quite profusely and quickly.
1754660	1756160	What hit points are you at now?
1756160	1757160	18.
1757160	1758160	All right.
1758160	1768920	And then Stan looks up into the eyes of Keith Vigna and you guys all begin to hear time
1769180	1773180	slow down and you hear the screams of the people.
1773180	1775180	The pace of molasses.
1775180	1782180	The screams of the people who are in the funeral not 30 seconds ago as they're making their
1782180	1785180	way back to the parking lot at an absurd rate.
1785180	1787180	But not anymore.
1787180	1788180	All right.
1788180	1789180	No longer absurd.
1789180	1792180	Oh, also very absurd just in the opposite way.
1792180	1794180	Yeah, absurdly slow now they're running.
1794180	1795180	It's so dangerous.
1795180	1797180	Why are you running so slow?
1797440	1800180	You hear his voice in your head say,
1800180	1804180	Silas and Mary Cole were never seen again.
1804180	1806180	Neither was Cornelius Beans.
1806180	1814180	That was the history of contention when my daughter's name was Mia or Leah or Micah or
1814180	1820180	Ben but her name is Ari forever now and our history is different.
1820180	1822180	Mine is now definite.
1822180	1830180	And with that the body of Stan Manstein seems to in one swift instant turn inside out and
1830180	1832180	blip out of existence.
1832180	1833180	Oh, man.
1833180	1835180	What happens to my fingers?
1835180	1836180	That time, Dick.
1836180	1840180	I need all three of you to roll sanity.
1840180	1842180	Seven.
1842180	1843180	Sane as fuck.
1843180	1844180	Oh, shit.
1844180	1845180	I'm going insane.
1845180	1846180	I failed.
1846180	1847180	I failed too.
1847180	1849180	A 62 on a 21.
1849180	1850180	And what's your power?
1850180	1851180	60.
1851180	1853180	Do we all have a mechanic left?
1853180	1854180	I'm at 15 sanity.
1854180	1855180	I rolled a 23.
1855180	1857180	My power is 50.
1857180	1858180	All right.
1858180	1860180	Clark and Keith both lose one sanity.
1860180	1861180	I'm at 20.
1861180	1862180	I am now at 14.
1862180	1866180	I pop up blind to the pain of the bullets that have ripped through my body and I am
1866180	1872180	charging at the guy who had his legs hogtied on the ground.
1872180	1876180	I'm rushing him and doing whatever I can to kill him.
1876180	1877180	All right.
1877180	1878180	Do you want to?
1878180	1881180	I would like to fire my weapon into his face as I near.
1881180	1886180	Go ahead and roll firearms there.
1886180	1888180	I pass a 20 on an 80.
1888180	1889180	All right.
1889180	1891180	And roll a D10 for me.
1891180	1892180	A seven.
1892180	1898180	With him being already on the ground fully hogtied and you sprinting toward him, I think
1898180	1904180	it's perfectly acceptable for you to end this man's life on this turn if you want to describe
1904180	1905180	that.
1905180	1906180	It's legal, baby.
1907180	1913180	You guys would see rage over my face as I bum rush this guy and I'm firing as I'm
1913180	1914180	running.
1914180	1919180	And even as I come to a stop over his body, I just keep firing into his head, maybe screaming.
1924180	1933180	And as you're firing into this head, you hear this like, and like all of these wires
1933180	1936180	are flying and all these sparks are flying around.
1936180	1943180	And this man's, I mean, not a man, it's like an android head just kind of like peels
1943180	1947180	open to all the bullets that are flying through it.
1947180	1952180	Something has exploded in it from the inside almost the way it peels out in every single
1952180	1957180	direction of skin and viscera and metal and wires.
1957180	1961180	And you look down satisfied.
1961180	1964180	We're going to exit round combat.
1964180	1967180	What if I want to fire on the civilians running away?
1967180	1970180	I had a final move, sort of.
1970180	1971180	It's pretty minor.
1971180	1976180	Can I clarify, maybe I just missed this, the bullets that went through the back of John
1976180	1979180	Lee Pettymore, were they from the guy on the ground?
1979180	1982180	I thought we had an unknown assailant still shooting at us.
1982180	1984180	They did not come from the guy on the ground.
1984180	1985180	But we're not in combat.
1985180	1986180	That is correct.
1986180	1987180	Okay, cool.
1987180	1988180	I'm glad I clarified.
1988180	1989180	I dig it.
1989180	1990180	I think my question is related to that.
1991180	1996180	John Lee Pettymore looks up to the top of the mausoleum where Rosemary was perched
1996180	2000180	earlier, and he sees absolutely nothing.
2000180	2002180	Okay, so, yeah.
2002180	2004180	So we're no longer in combat.
2004180	2006180	What do we see when we look around?
2006180	2010180	First off, the sun is a little bit higher in the sky now.
2010180	2013180	The fog has slightly dissipated in this cemetery.
2013180	2017180	The smell of crawfish is still potent as ever.
2017180	2021180	The people who are attending this funeral are gone.
2021180	2030180	The only bodies standing around are Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, Kevin, and the corpses
2030180	2035180	of these large men who are half robot, half human.
2035180	2040180	I want to go over to the casket and see if Ari is actually in there.
2040180	2042180	Ari is actually in there.
2042180	2043180	Okay.
2043180	2049180	Clark regains some composure and whips around on Kevin and holds him at gunpoint.
2049180	2051180	Hey, who are you?
2051180	2055180	As you do this, I walk up next to Kevin and stand there.
2055180	2056180	Like on his side?
2056180	2057180	Yeah.
2057180	2059180	Oh, I don't lower the gun.
2059180	2061180	Keith, what are you doing?
2061180	2063180	I have my hands down at my side.
2063180	2064180	I'm just listening.
2064180	2065180	I look at you.
2065180	2066180	Kevin looks at you.
2066180	2068180	He says, bubblegum tree.
2068180	2069180	How do you know that word?
2069180	2070180	How do you know that word?
2070180	2073180	Why are you wearing an old contention PD uniform?
2073180	2074180	Who are you?
2074180	2075180	I'm Clark Bishop.
2075180	2077180	Why are you alive?
2077180	2080180	I don't, Keith, I don't know.
2080180	2081180	Keith, why are you alive?
2081180	2083180	I kind of know why Keith's alive.
2083180	2085180	Actually, I do know why you're alive.
2085180	2086180	I'm a little bit.
2086180	2091180	Maybe you could tell me then because I don't know.
2091180	2095180	Well, it's a little complicated.
2095180	2097180	Real quick, bubblegum tree?
2097180	2098180	Bubblegum tree.
2098180	2099180	Bubblegum tree.
2099180	2101180	What's Keith doing with his weapons?
2101180	2103180	My gun's back in my pocket.
2103180	2105180	Everybody bubblegum tree and let's put our guns down.
2105180	2107180	Is that all right?
2107180	2110180	I stare them down a little longer than you probably want,
2110180	2112180	but I do start to.
2112180	2113180	You can see I'm moving my guns down.
2113180	2115180	I start to put them down.
2115180	2116180	Okay, I holster my gun.
2116180	2118180	I holster mine.
2118180	2124180	I put mine in my pocket that is way too big for me.
2124180	2127180	Yeah, we could tell you were authentic, Keith.
2127180	2132180	Also, you guys would have noticed that I am no longer
2132180	2135180	wearing my contention PD uniform.
2135180	2139180	I'm wearing a way too small orange polo and three times
2139180	2145180	too big teal frat boy pants and Sperry's.
2145180	2146180	Nice.
2146180	2147180	I was apprised of that.
2147180	2149180	What are Sperry's?
2149180	2150180	Like butt shoes?
2150180	2151180	Gotcha.
2151180	2153180	I actually, yeah, I knew that as well.
2153180	2154180	Yeah, so I.
2154180	2156180	It was very in character as far as I was concerned.
2156180	2162180	My very tiny, powerful gun slips right into these huge.
2162180	2165180	Right into your Sperry's.
2165180	2167180	Right into my big, big old pocket.
2167180	2168180	All right.
2168180	2170180	Now that we've all bubble gum treed,
2170180	2174180	let's talk about what's happened to us in the preceding 12 hours.
2174180	2177180	Clark is still really side-eyeing you.
2177180	2178180	He's right in front of you.
2178180	2179180	Yeah, he's.
2179180	2180180	And I turn.
2180180	2181180	He's turned his head.
2181180	2183180	So he's side-eyeing you.
2183180	2185180	I can't even look at you.
2186180	2189180	But yeah, I am side-eyeing you as I talk to Keith.
2189180	2192180	Keith, do you know this guy?
2192180	2193180	Well.
2193180	2194180	Do you remember who he is?
2194180	2195180	We saw him.
2195180	2196180	He killed me.
2196180	2198180	Clark goes back for his gun.
2198180	2204180	But I owe his organization my life.
2204180	2206180	His organization?
2206180	2207180	The Glass family.
2207180	2212180	Clark, can I talk to you without Keith?
2212180	2215180	Actually, I go over to the crawfish pot.
2215180	2219180	I just pull Clark aside if he'll let Kevin do that.
2219180	2220180	I gesture like, hey man.
2220180	2224180	Yeah, if you gestured, I would cautiously go.
2224180	2226180	Hey, Clark.
2226180	2228180	Hey man, bubble gum tree, bubble gum tree.
2228180	2231180	Can't wait to talk for a minute.
2231180	2232180	Yeah.
2232180	2234180	How do you know that word?
2234180	2240180	Well, because I was John Lee Pettymore.
2240180	2241180	Listen.
2241180	2244180	What does that mean?
2244180	2245180	Right?
2245180	2246180	Yeah.
2246180	2255180	So I found out that John Lee Pettymore is more of a state of mind than just a single
2255180	2256180	individual.
2256180	2257180	Clark.
2257180	2258180	Wow, man.
2258180	2260180	This is going to be hard to explain.
2260180	2269180	Basically, my daddy, whom I thought was slain by the DEA on his weed farm, turns out he
2269180	2276180	was just lobotomized and he's been Marvin Glass's head of security for a while now.
2276180	2280180	And when I died, turns out I wasn't John Lee Pettymore.
2280180	2284180	I was some kind of alien squid being or something.
2284180	2289180	But I sucked out of my brain and I left my body and I went into his.
2289180	2291180	Clark is slack-jawed.
2291180	2292180	Squid?
2292180	2293180	Squid something?
2293180	2294180	What was that?
2294180	2295180	Or mechanical.
2295180	2296180	I don't really know.
2296180	2304180	All I know is I felt myself leave John's body and insert myself into my daddy's body.
2304180	2306180	And now I'm him.
2306180	2310180	You believe me, right?
2310180	2311180	Clark doesn't.
2311180	2315180	Ask me something only John Lee Pettymore would know.
2315180	2319180	So Joe was just going through his notebook to try to find a good thing like that.
2319180	2320180	Oh, I know.
2320180	2321180	Okay.
2321180	2322180	Me and John.
2322180	2324180	We got called out and we were in a suburban neighborhood.
2324180	2325180	Yeah.
2325180	2326180	And something terrible happened.
2326180	2329180	Can you tell me what the terrible thing that happened with the vacuum?
2329180	2330180	Yeah.
2330180	2334180	Those kids, they got hit by the goo.
2334180	2335180	Yeah.
2335180	2336180	Yeah.
2336180	2338180	And then we didn't tell nobody about it.
2338180	2340180	John, what the fuck?
2340180	2342180	And I hugged you in front of me.
2342180	2343180	Watch my scars.
2343180	2344180	Watch my scars.
2344180	2347180	Thomas, roll alertness for me real quick.
2347180	2349180	68 on a 60.
2349180	2352180	Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
2352180	2353180	Damn it.
2354180	2360180	I told this all to a false Clark.
2360180	2363180	If I passed the role, I would have known.
2363180	2366180	He hugged a little harder than Clark Bishop ever would.
2366180	2371180	As I'm hugging, I'll call you John now, the Kevin body.
2371180	2374180	I kind of whisper in your ear as I'm hugging you.
2374180	2377180	Maggie's alive.
2377180	2379180	That can't be.
2379180	2383180	John, I just spent the afternoon with, with, with her.
2383180	2384180	Chief's alive.
2384180	2388180	I'm fucking working for her now, man.
2388180	2390180	She knows about this stuff.
2390180	2393180	Hey man, here's an ocean.
2393180	2400180	I think the chief died, but I think there's other us's.
2400180	2404180	Do you know what I saw?
2404180	2422180	I saw your body broken on the ground, shattered, but an old you, an old Clark came by and was
2422180	2426180	whispering some shit over that body.
2426180	2431180	These two weird brothers kind of distracted me from investigating further, but there was
2431180	2433180	another you running around contention.
2433180	2434180	I remember that.
2434180	2436180	Is this the same Maggie?
2436180	2438180	You know, it's Maggie.
2438180	2442180	Is it our Maggie?
2442180	2444180	I mean, I thought so.
2444180	2446180	She, she knew me.
2446180	2449180	We talked about her and me.
2449180	2452180	I wink and I say, I know you, but I'm not John.
2452180	2454180	And I draw my gun.
2454180	2455180	I'm just kidding.
2455180	2456180	Oh shit.
2456180	2457180	Wait.
2457180	2466180	So you saw me, you saw me dead because I'm not dead.
2466180	2468180	Now you were as dead as Bob.
2468180	2470180	Oh, I lift up.
2470180	2483180	I lift up my shirt and show you what's beneath and you see a hole through my chest, essentially
2484180	2486180	where my heart should be.
2486180	2487180	You can see through it.
2487180	2492180	It says if I had a piercing there, like the skin is all healed around it.
2492180	2494180	It's like a tunnel through my, through my body.
2494180	2495180	How big is the diameter?
2495180	2496180	Oh, fist.
2496180	2497180	Yeah.
2497180	2498180	I stick my fist through there.
2498180	2499180	I did that too, John.
2499180	2501180	It feels weird.
2501180	2502180	John.
2502180	2504180	I don't, I don't have a heart.
2504180	2509180	Well, that was your one weakness beforehand.
2509180	2512180	My weakness was I didn't have a daddy, but now I am a daddy.
2512180	2513180	So I think we're just getting stronger.
2513180	2514180	John.
2514180	2515180	I'm happy for you.
2515180	2516180	I think.
2516180	2517180	Yeah.
2517180	2518180	I mean, my back is sore.
2518180	2519180	I'm older.
2519180	2520180	My knees kind of hurt.
2520180	2523180	My penis is not as big, but it's not broken.
2523180	2530180	So it's kind of a good trade off up until a few minutes ago when I got shot three times,
2530180	2532180	I felt like a million bucks.
2532180	2533180	Oh yeah.
2533180	2534180	I got shot too.
2534180	2541180	As you guys show your bullet wounds to each other that are just bleeding with no mechanical
2541680	2544180	disadvantage for you, apparently.
2544180	2546180	Isn't that nice?
2546180	2547180	John.
2547180	2555180	I mean, I don't know why I'm alive, but I woke up with my own heart in a bag and I ran
2555180	2562180	into Maggie and John, I got to tell you, I'm, I'm working for some people now.
2562180	2567180	They call themselves the circle of knowledge.
2567180	2570180	Uh, Clark says it like that cause he feels like it's a mysterious thing.
2571180	2572180	John rolls his eyes.
2572180	2573180	Kevin.
2573180	2574180	Sorry.
2574180	2576180	Kevin rolls his eyes.
2576180	2578180	I think we can call you John.
2578180	2580180	You're technically John Lee Pettymore.
2580180	2586180	Uh, Maggie's part of them and so it was her dad and we went to a, well guess where they
2586180	2587180	are?
2587180	2588180	The mill.
2588180	2589180	Yeah.
2589180	2590180	That makes sense.
2590180	2592180	What was going on with the foot meat?
2592180	2593180	We didn't get to that.
2593180	2594180	That's a good one.
2594180	2595180	Although maybe.
2595180	2597180	Well, Maggie, does she have a foot?
2597180	2598180	Did Maggie have a foot?
2598180	2600180	You didn't notice her not having a foot.
2600180	2601180	Okay.
2601180	2606180	Uh, she, as far as I remember, she had both of them feets.
2606180	2608180	That, that seems like a thing you would have observed.
2608180	2610180	So I trust you.
2610180	2611180	Wait, hold on.
2611180	2613180	That was too Batman.
2613180	2618180	Let's see how I trust you.
2618180	2619180	Good.
2619180	2622180	You need, you need both feet and nobody wants a feet getting it.
2622180	2624180	I said it two times.
2624180	2625180	Am I going to say it again?
2625180	2626180	Getting it.
2626180	2627180	Getting it.
2627180	2631180	Do you remember and see Keith Vigna just eating some of the crawfish that's in the
2631180	2633180	boil in front of the coffin?
2633180	2634180	I just figured.
2634180	2635180	Yeah, that sounds right.
2635180	2638180	I also have some things that I should probably tell both of you.
2638180	2639180	Yeah.
2639180	2641380	I was going to say, do you, wait, okay, hang on.
2641380	2642620	How was I pointed Keith?
2642620	2643620	How's he alive?
2643620	2644620	Okay.
2644620	2645620	You remember Charlie?
2645620	2648740	Uh, Charlie was Rosemary's partner.
2648740	2649740	Charles Donovan.
2649740	2650740	Charles.
2650740	2651740	Yeah.
2651740	2652740	Donovan.
2652740	2653740	Yeah.
2654300	2659100	Me and this forum, we all have some body modifications that help us.
2659100	2661760	Well, Rosemary wasn't sure she could die.
2661760	2663800	She was kind of freaked out that Charles died.
2663800	2667000	She told me that today, but Keith has the same scars.
2667000	2668000	What all of us have.
2668000	2671760	I don't know if we have arm rockets like that robot.
2671760	2672760	Let me check it out.
2672760	2675180	I try to shoot her my hand.
2675180	2680740	It's that scene where Tobey Maguire is like, go web, go.
2680740	2681740	It's been a long time.
2681740	2682740	He shoots the web, right?
2683740	2685620	All right.
2685620	2686620	Not in that one.
2686620	2688380	Stand back.
2688380	2691500	And I just hold my arm out and nothing happens.
2691500	2692500	Nevermind.
2692500	2697700	Oh, so we don't seem to have, we don't, we're not inspector gadgets, but it seems like we
2697700	2700420	have some combat, some body modifications.
2700420	2704100	What make us stronger?
2704100	2705100	So that's cool.
2705460	2713220	But anyway, I saw some, some figures with funny shaped sides, dragging Keith off Marvin
2713220	2716720	Glass said that we turned them into the new Charles.
2716720	2718220	So they made them a murder machine.
2718220	2724640	I think of some variety of my variety of Rosemary's variety, but not of the robot variety.
2724640	2728760	So you, you don't have, are you, you have metal in you, John, are you medley?
2728760	2729980	I try to shoot my hand again.
2729980	2733180	I'm really like straining.
2733180	2738540	No, unfortunately I don't think so.
2738540	2743380	However, when you, when you look at some of the wounds that you have taken, there is some
2743380	2746500	metal underneath your skin in some places.
2746500	2748260	Hold on.
2748260	2749260	What about this tink?
2749260	2753460	It actually looks like there's some metal.
2753460	2754460	I see it.
2754460	2755460	Perhaps some you're shiny.
2755460	2757140	Perhaps some mechanized self-healing.
2757140	2758140	I'm not sure.
2758300	2761700	It looks like a, uh, almost like a, like a, like a dermal layer.
2761700	2763340	That's all metallic.
2763340	2765000	That's cool.
2765000	2767580	If you're okay with it, that's a, I know that I'm on board with you.
2767580	2768580	That's awesome.
2768580	2769580	Thanks to tell you.
2769580	2770580	Let's talk to that's Brent.
2770580	2774700	That's rope Keith in on this and regarding Marvin glasses, ultimate emissions.
2774700	2776860	I'll tell you what Maggie wants.
2776860	2787660	I've been waiting since December, 2017 to learn that Clark and John walk over to Keith,
2787660	2791020	who is at the crawfish station.
2791020	2795420	I am shoving my, I'm peeling crawfish.
2795420	2800000	I'm hurting my hands cause they're still in the, like whoever was running this crawfish
2800000	2802900	boil is long gone.
2802900	2805180	So I'm, there's no utensils or anything.
2805180	2811620	So I'm just like quickly dipping my hand into the boiling crawfish water and grabbing crawfish
2811620	2814100	and just slamming them into my mouth.
2814100	2815100	It's our key.
2815100	2816100	That's Keith.
2816100	2817100	It's him.
2817540	2818540	Yeah.
2818540	2819540	The proof is there.
2819540	2825660	Guys, maybe, I mean bubble gum tree, but now I'm going to say crawfish boil.
2825660	2826660	Anyway.
2826660	2827660	Yeah.
2827660	2830380	So I've, I've got just shit all over my face.
2830380	2844020	I've been really, I've got, I'm like, no, I've got just crawfish, you know, like shell
2844020	2847540	on my face and just spices and everything.
2847540	2852500	Cause I mean, you guys were talking over there for a minute, so I was just going to town
2852500	2853500	on this.
2853500	2856500	My, my, also my fingers are like, they're very red.
2856500	2862020	I'm going to take one hit point of, of damage.
2862020	2865780	I'm going to do that for the sake of the, what does that put your hit points at?
2865780	2866780	I'm zero.
2866780	2879620	I am currently at 25 out of 25, so I'm just for the sake of that bit, I'm taking one.
2879620	2880620	All right.
2880620	2881620	That's going to end like six months.
2881620	2887980	We're going to be like, you motherfucker, it's going to come back to bite you so hard.
2887980	2888980	Oh fuck.
2888980	2889980	Yeah.
2889980	2895340	So my fingers hurt, but I am pleased with this crawfish boil.
2895340	2896340	Yeah.
2896900	2902540	To Keith and I look at you and I'm just peeling a crawfish open and Keith, do you, do you
2902540	2904580	know who, who, who this is?
2904580	2907460	And I gestured to the guy standing there with us.
2907460	2910460	I mean, I give an awkward smile in a way of Kevin.
2910460	2911460	That's Marvin's body.
2911460	2912460	Oh, okay.
2912460	2916860	I walk up to Keith and I get right by his ear and I whisper in his ear.
2916860	2919860	I'm like, I know what you did to my Smokies.
2919860	2922040	Now, now do you know Keith?
2922040	2924660	And I punch him in the gut.
2924660	2932080	I spit out the crawfish that's in my mouth.
2932080	2937100	When you said bubblegum tree, I thought maybe John Lee Pettymore had told you to say that,
2937100	2942500	but only John knows about the Smokies.
2942500	2950500	I get back up from you punching me in the gut and I look at you and I give you a hug.
2950500	2953860	So did I.
2954280	2961320	And I look at Clark and I look over at John Lee Pettymore and just a big, big smile comes
2961320	2962320	across my face.
2962320	2965800	I'm like, boys, we did it.
2965800	2970800	Listen boys, it's not quite over yet.
2970800	2973160	I learned a little bit.
2973160	2974160	Marvin Glass.
2974160	2976660	This is all some business play to him.
2976660	2980480	He wants to demolish contention so we can have a land.
2980740	2987020	At least it's what I extrapolated from what I heard, but we're not done yet boys.
2987020	2988660	We got to save the town.
2988660	2991420	John, it might be even bigger than the town.
2991420	2997020	Hey, uh, hey Keith, Maggie, she's, she's still alive.
2997020	3001440	No, I saw her dead with my own two eyes.
3001440	3003420	I saw you dead with my own two eyes, Keith.
3003420	3006200	I saw you both dead with my own two eyes.
3006200	3008180	Also now I'm in another body.
3008180	3010180	Somebody else's eyes.
3010180	3016440	Well, boys, we have been through some of the weirdest shit ever, so you know, I believe
3016440	3017440	it.
3017440	3018440	What's she doing?
3018440	3019440	What's she into?
3019440	3020980	Well, how's she?
3020980	3022160	She showed me things.
3022160	3023160	Maggie did?
3023160	3024160	Our babies.
3024160	3025160	Slap.
3025160	3026160	No.
3026160	3031840	You got some Kevin still left in you.
3031840	3037680	She showed me this, as I'm describing this to you guys, uh, any kind of a joviality about
3037680	3041660	running into you guys again, a freaked out in this and anything like that is washing
3041660	3046540	away from my face and it's mortal terror as I describe.
3046540	3057940	She showed me a creature I'd never, it wasn't boys, it's a, we got it.
3057940	3058940	We got to stop it.
3058940	3063060	It's a, I can't just, I can't describe it.
3063060	3065500	I start to, I start to cry a little bit.
3065500	3068080	It, it wants, it wants this.
3068080	3075160	It wants, I don't, I put my, I put my hand on Clark's shoulder, squeeze it kind of too
3075160	3077600	hard and I'm like, just tell us what you saw.
3077600	3079740	I take two steps back from the group.
3079740	3083160	It's a Maggie works for a group.
3083160	3085040	I, I work for a group now.
3085040	3093440	It's their only mission is to make it make what I saw not be a thing and boy, if you'd
3093440	3095920	got seen it too, you would have, you would have jumped.
3095920	3098500	You would have jumped when they said jump.
3098500	3099540	And that's what I've been doing.
3099540	3101020	That's what I'm doing now.
3101020	3102060	She told me I had to kill him.
3102060	3106460	So I, I came up here out, I shot him as soon as I saw him.
3106460	3108780	They told you to kill Stan.
3108780	3114300	She said it would, it would make sure that fucked me over Clark.
3114300	3118740	Maggie told Maggie told me that, uh, killing Stan would help help make that thing not be
3118740	3120540	a thing.
3120540	3121780	So I did.
3121780	3122940	Do you trust Maggie?
3122960	3129520	I trust her with my life always have, but after what she showed me, I just know that
3129520	3135400	she's on the good side, at least as far as making sure that thing isn't, isn't allowed
3135400	3137640	to do whatever the hell it wanted.
3137640	3144300	Well, I'm going to tell both of you guys, you might need to be watching my back cause
3144300	3147840	the glass family is going to be very angry at me.
3147840	3151280	I don't know that they wouldn't have killed him, but they needed to talk to him.
3151280	3152280	Yeah.
3152900	3156700	And the reason I'm still alive is because of the glass family.
3156700	3157860	They're going to be gunning for me.
3157860	3164160	I think what, what I was, I was tasked Marvin glass rebuilt me.
3164160	3166060	I died.
3166060	3170300	The only reason I'm here right now, when I'm looking at him physically, do I see any metal
3170300	3175660	when I'm telling you this, I ding on my head and you just hear metal.
3175660	3176660	It was creepy though.
3176660	3180380	We actually heard metal.
3180400	3186360	I point between you and uh, Kevin, John, KJ, he's got metal to Keith.
3186360	3189920	I mean, we're not invulnerable, but we're less vulnerable.
3189920	3191440	I think, I think there's metal things.
3191440	3192440	Pretty cool.
3192440	3196100	I told him I've got a gnarled old voice now.
3196100	3199600	I'm like Sam Elliott and roadhouse.
3199600	3200600	I'm me-o.
3213860	3219380	Did, did you not get a sexier upgrade?
3219380	3225420	I just, I hold my left hand up like this and I kind of do a fake fake gun in the air and
3225420	3228460	I'm like, I got a pretty sexy upgrade.
3228460	3229760	I'll tell you about that later.
3229760	3231240	Are you a gun hand?
3231240	3232240	Nope.
3232240	3235540	A gun of sorts, but we'll get to that later.
3235540	3236540	What sorts?
3236540	3237540	You're being shut up.
3237540	3238540	You're being mysterious.
3238540	3245080	I was supposed to bring Manstein back to Marvin glass and that would absolve me from any debt
3245080	3247460	to him for rebuilding me.
3247460	3254720	So I'm on your guys's side, but we might have some trouble coming after us.
3254720	3257560	I've, I've got two things to say.
3257560	3264260	The first, I'm not sure who saw me in this recent kerfuffle.
3264260	3267620	I don't know if anybody knows who I was shooting at, but I might be able to.
3267620	3268800	Are you okay?
3268800	3274540	By the way, what I mean is if, if we make me less okay, one of you like shoots me in
3274540	3279180	the leg or something, I might be able to go back and infiltrate the glass organization.
3279180	3281580	I'm not sure how much Rosemary saw.
3281580	3285000	I mean, Keith, I talked to Maggie.
3285000	3292260	I asked her if I could bring you guys into the fold and she says she would trust me.
3292260	3297540	And if I trusted her and that if I thought you guys could handle it, she's offered to
3297540	3299100	put me up in the middle.
3299100	3300620	She says she could protect me.
3300620	3305180	Keith can't handle it.
3305180	3308900	I told her she, she, she asked if I thought you guys could handle it and I said, you'd
3308900	3310540	seen the same things I had.
3310600	3317840	Well, what I told Marvin Glass leaving his compound was that I would bring Stan back
3317840	3320120	to him for questioning.
3320120	3325200	Now that that is not an option, I became a cop for a reason.
3325200	3328680	I want to do good by people.
3328680	3337220	And if you think that is the option that is good, I fully want to join you.
3337220	3341960	I'm just warning you, we're going to have some real bad people after us.
3341960	3345140	With or without you, Glass is going to be after us.
3345140	3348080	That doesn't put any more burden on our shoulders, I don't think.
3348080	3349760	Well then let me come with you.
3349760	3350760	Yeah.
3350760	3351760	Hey, come on.
3351760	3352760	Come on.
3352760	3353760	Come on.
3353760	3356000	Let's go kill Marvin Glass.
3356000	3360160	Whatever the fold is, I want to be brought into it if you think it's good.
3360160	3361600	Marvin Glass is after you.
3361600	3363720	Marvin Glass is going to be after all of us.
3363720	3365560	Our duty is to stop him.
3365580	3370100	We've been a team for so long, why stop being a team now?
3370100	3371500	Teamwork make the dream work.
3371500	3375900	What if the real contention police department was the friends we made along the way?
3375900	3376900	I wrote that.
3376900	3379300	That is amazing.
3379300	3380580	So I always liked you, Clark.
3380580	3381580	You're so smart.
3381580	3386500	Well, I guess here's what I'll tell you is that Maggie, she told me that this was my
3386500	3391260	mission for today and that after I completed it, I could kind of do what I needed to for
3391260	3392260	a while.
3392260	3395060	She actually told me to get my affairs in order and contention so that I could move
3395060	3396580	up to the mill with them.
3396580	3397900	So I got some time.
3397900	3399280	I could touch base with her.
3399280	3401880	Are you planning on going back to contention?
3401880	3404280	Because guys, I haven't told you this yet.
3404280	3411960	I had tens of missed calls from Drew and a voicemail that basically said, get as far
3411960	3413720	away from contention as you can.
3413720	3418060	Well, I'll tell you my tentative plan was to get back to my place and grab all the guns
3418060	3422800	and things that we confiscated from my garage and I was going to just move shop up to the
3422800	3423800	mill.
3423800	3424800	Get objects and whatnot.
3424800	3427960	Get everything back in the place.
3427960	3430720	We had the camera in the car.
3430720	3432720	It's not in there anymore.
3432720	3434800	I don't know where the gun is.
3434800	3435800	We had the camera in the car?
3435800	3436800	Yeah.
3436800	3441840	I brought it with me cause I thought maybe around, you know, I think one o'clock it might
3441840	3445400	be working, but it's not in there anymore.
3445400	3447160	Did we have the gun in the car?
3447160	3448160	Yeah, we did.
3448160	3449440	And the gun's gone too.
3449440	3450440	It's not in there anymore.
3450440	3452300	Well, the gun we know who has it.
3452300	3455700	We brought it up to the meeting, so it's whoever was in that room.
3455700	3456700	Right?
3456700	3457700	Yeah.
3457700	3458700	That's right.
3458700	3459700	But the camera, it's not in there anymore.
3459700	3460700	Right.
3460700	3465340	We might need to run back to the police station and your house to get all this stuff, but
3465340	3470620	I'm really fingers crossed hoping that at least the helmet and the jukebox is still
3470620	3471620	there.
3471620	3472620	The radio.
3472620	3473620	The radio.
3473620	3480440	I've got an ocean and you just see, um, Kevin Lee, Patty Moore, he puts his, he puts his
3480440	3484760	hands to his head and his eyes just kind of go white.
3484760	3486760	Oh shit.
3486760	3487760	John.
3487760	3488760	John.
3488760	3489760	John.
3489760	3518080	How am I the only one trying to fool Oh, how can you have my hand
3518080	3544400	How can you have enough drowning out All I know is there's no more to go
