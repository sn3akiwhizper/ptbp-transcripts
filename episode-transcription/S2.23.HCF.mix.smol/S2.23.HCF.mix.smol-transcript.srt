00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello, all, and welcome to the best radio show in town.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,800
It's 694.2 PTBP, and I'm your host, Wolf the Dog.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm here to say things, and you are here to listen.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,840
A perfect relationship.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,680
Sometimes, you're here to say things,

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,640
and I'm here to listen.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,160
This episode's Howlin' with Wolf is from Cupcake Sinclair

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,960
in Las Vegas, Nevada, who tweeted about the show

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,520
and tagged at PretendingPod, an easy and nice thing

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,200
you can also do to spread the love and joy of 694.2 PTBP

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,920
with your online friendos.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Cupcake Sinclair writes, PTBP equals amazing.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,400
I'm hooked, and I love the reminder

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,960
that sex work is real work.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,520
There is discrimination not only from society,

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,720
but credit cards dictating what can appear.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,040
For example, TV can film sleeping, hypnosis, et cetera,

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
but we cannot.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
I ask listeners to please consider

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
how hypocritical laws passed against sex workers

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,320
are a canary in the coal mine for wider changes that will

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,600
affect us all down the road, especially

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,720
in terms of what consenting adults do.

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,400
And that's just porn.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,200
You know a sex worker whether you realize or not.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,040
Thank you guys for your hard work, the hilarity you bring,

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,040
and the consideration of my announcement.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,680
XOXO, submissive Cupcake Sinclair.

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,240
Well, damn, Cupcake Sinclair.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,440
Thanks for all the shout outs and praise.

31
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,520
Let's make sure we all support sex workers' rights.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,440
If you wanna write up something for your little Wolfie

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,800
to how, tag at pretending pod on Twitter,

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,840
tag at pretending pod on instant gram,

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,480
and tag pretending to be people on Facebook.

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,920
Or write up a five star review on the podcast app

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,280
of your choice.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,280
If you give ol' Wolfie a shout out,

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,040
I might read that dang review right here

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,520
in the wettest broadcasting studio

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,000
this side of the Mississippi.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,440
And this side, it means under.

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,320
Do you wanna check out our shit

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,080
without having to type a single letter?

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,560
All of our links are where?

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,600
Say it with me, children.

47
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,960
All of our links are where?

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,160
In the show notes.

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,240
Seriously, go look at the show notes.

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,400
It's wild stuff in there.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,320
And it takes me about four hours to type them up

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,040
with these big ol' nasty paws.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,160
Please acknowledge my hard work

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,160
and excellent use of language.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,480
Now dial up for some vile fluff.

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,800
It's time for the news.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Last time, we met Shelly St. Blythe,

58
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,120
a crystal doctor with a penchant for puppetry

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,320
who witnessed something wildly unnatural back in the day.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,600
He was at a dig site with the charming and capable

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Dr. Brock Hargrave, as well as Jimmy Corrigan,

62
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,320
a badass merc with a soft spot for his wife and children.

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,120
A woman with myriad names, a shrinking frame,

64
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,440
and the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh

65
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,360
continued building her personal strike team

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,360
with the owner of Boeri Security, Vincent T. Boeri,

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,320
who has an eye for fashion

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,600
and an even better eye for new employees.

69
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,880
And for this particular mission,

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,360
she rounded out the squad with a vagabond called Meat Hook.

71
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,480
They received their assignment

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,680
in this emaciated woman's house

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,160
that reeked of cat piss, sans the cats.

74
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,520
The briefing was as follows.

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Dr. Brock Hargrave and one of his coworkers

76
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,800
at Holy Cow Farms have gone missing.

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Dr. Hargrave headed out after work

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,280
and just didn't come back,

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,800
but his missing coworker seemingly never left

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,280
the office building of Holy Cow Farms,

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,720
taking us now to the death two-car convoy

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
of Jimmy Corrigan's Jeep and a, Jesus, a stretch Escalade?

83
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,280
Well, this team may be fucked,

84
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,120
but at least we have Hudson Freeman

85
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,920
with Muscles R. Spreems.

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,800
Let's go.

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
Let's go.

88
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,920
What's up, everybody?

89
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,500
I was thinking the same thing.

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,480
I am now mechanization.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,960
All my muscles work like screams.

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,400
What's up, everybody?

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,240
Welcome to episode two of this short story here

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,840
on pretending to be people.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,000
It's Holy Cow Farms time.

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
Holy Cow Farms.

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,720
Holy cow.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
You know, we looked that up

99
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,960
and Zach, there's only two businesses in the country

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,440
that are currently named that.

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,560
So pretty good pun.

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400
Pretty good.

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,320
And one of them is close enough

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,240
where we can go take a picture with the sign.

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
Yeah.

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Or we can go break into their facilities.

107
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,920
We should do that.

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,400
We should break into the Holy Cow Farms

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,840
that's in Arkansas just as a tribute to this episode.

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,520
We should role play inside.

111
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,080
And cause we found out we're all cousins.

112
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,520
We are all cousins.

113
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Us, Paul Rudd, who else?

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,640
The Royals.

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,440
Jon Hamm.

116
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
That's right.

117
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,400
Lord.

118
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,480
Mark Twain.

119
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,240
Ellie Kemper.

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,080
Ellie Kemper.

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,920
John Goodman.

122
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
Oh, Disney.

123
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Jenna Fisher.

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
Good pull, yes.

125
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Janelle Monae, but she won't claim it.

126
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,320
Ah, damn.

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,440
She's from KC though.

128
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
Did you say John Goodman?

129
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,760
No, I said John Goodman.

130
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,400
John Goodman.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah.

132
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
Oh yeah, Brad Pitt.

133
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
Brad Pitt, he's from our town.

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,200
Our friend, Brad.

135
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,480
I found out something terrible about Brad Pitt.

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
What?

137
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
He was born in Oklahoma, not Missouri.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,840
What?

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,160
Even though he grew up here

140
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,920
and spent his formative years in Springfield.

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,520
You really scared me for a minute there.

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,720
I really thought you were going to say something

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
to harm the reputation of our Lord and Savior, Brad Pitt.

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Hey, hey, hold on.

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,000
This is the Jesus podcast.

146
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,640
Okay, any Jesus lover can admit

147
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,600
that Brad Pitt is as close as we got on this planet.

148
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
I want him opening the gates of heaven.

149
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,440
You know what I mean?

150
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,720
I recently watched him murder so many people on a train.

151
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,640
But did he feel bad about it?

152
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,440
He kind of did, honest.

153
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,080
Did any of you see that?

154
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,920
I did see it.

155
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
I still haven't seen it.

156
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,840
Bullet train, so fucking good.

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Did you see it Becca?

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
Not yet, no.

159
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,120
You should.

160
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
It's a fun one.

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,080
I heard Luke and Joe liked it.

162
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,160
I heard it was more ensemble than Brad Pitt.

163
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,480
Yeah, he was the string that ran through the whole movie,

164
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,440
but it was great.

165
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,560
It was like a live action anime starring Brad Pitt.

166
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
That's all I need.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,440
That's a great pitch.

168
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,280
Becca, I'm curious to hear a little bit more

169
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,080
about your role-playing history.

170
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm sure you've shared this many, many times before,

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,800
but what brought you to this lovely hobby

172
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
that we all share?

173
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,480
The money, baby.

174
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
Fuck yeah, bro.

175
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,280
Pray the bills.

176
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,280
No, hey, I was just a bystander when crit role started.

177
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,440
Having snacks in the kitchen with them at Geek and Sundry,

178
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,280
and we played all kinds of other role-playing games there.

179
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,280
And at first, so competitive board gaming is my jam.

180
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
I love it.

181
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,400
Love me some magic, love me any competitive board game.

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,400
But once I understood intellectually

183
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,120
that you don't need to win,

184
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,400
in fact, it's way more fun to lose terribly,

185
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,160
that's when role-playing really clicked for me.

186
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,280
And I also have an acting background

187
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,000
from the University of Missouri, Kansas City.

188
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
I've driven by there.

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,400
So, you know, I just get to act,

190
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,360
but with only my voice and that's real fun.

191
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
Hell yeah.

192
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Do you act with your whole body anyway

193
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
while you're doing voice acting?

194
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,980
Not today, because I kept my camera off.

195
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,040
But I mean, you've seen us waving our arms around wildly.

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Are you doing that like just for no one?

197
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Fun fact, when I do like a commercial voiceover,

198
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,680
I do wiggle my arms in the air.

199
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,200
Like they're little serpents

200
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,760
that are helping me to explain the product.

201
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,080
It's your favorite product you've sold with your voice?

202
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,840
Magic the Gathering.

203
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,480
Hell yeah.

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,320
Yeah, that's sick.

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,160
And it's a good tie-in for Delta Green,

206
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
because one of the artists

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,800
on the original Magic the Gathering run

208
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,940
was one of the creators of this game

209
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
that we're playing this evening, Delta Green.

210
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,380
Oh shit, I hope it's not one that was canceled.

211
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,260
I hope not.

212
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,100
Me too.

213
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,180
You know those OG artists,

214
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,900
there's some fucked up shit in some of that card stuff.

215
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,700
I'll Google Dennis Stettwiller canceled later

216
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,860
and we'll find out.

217
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,940
That's a leading question.

218
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Does Meat Hook have a collection of banned Magic cards?

219
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Meat Hook made her own banned Magic cards.

220
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,940
And she's remembering going through the cards in her mind

221
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,740
as you're driving, sitting in this car,

222
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,460
because it feels like Magic being inside a vehicle

223
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,220
for the third time in your life, Meat Hook.

224
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,220
And we see the holy cow of magic cards

225
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,220
and we see the holy cow farms office building,

226
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,340
except for holy cow farm seems to share this office building

227
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,440
with a few other companies listed on the sign out front.

228
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,860
It is a very boxy, nondescript office building

229
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,260
with a large parking lot

230
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,420
where you can park wherever you would like.

231
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,140
Today is a Tuesday.

232
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,560
It is 8.57 PM, almost nine o'clock.

233
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,880
The parking lot is dark.

234
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,020
There are orange lights, lighting up specific segments.

235
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,160
And there is a van parked up near the door

236
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,800
that says trolleys cleaning service.

237
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,120
And it's the van has like a paint job,

238
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
like it's a trolley car.

239
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Goomba.

240
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,880
I've used those guys a hell of a lot.

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,920
They keep the mouth shut.

242
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,600
Wait, you say that like they're that kind of cleaner?

243
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,880
They do all sorts.

244
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
Well, they do my townhouse.

245
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm sure they do a fricking fantastic job.

246
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
Perhaps they'll have a card.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,960
You got a whole townhouse?

248
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,160
Oh, of course, yes.

249
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,360
Do you need someone to live in the basement or something?

250
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,460
Do you need?

251
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,960
It does get lonely there at times.

252
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,320
It would be fun to have a roommates of sorts, yes, sure.

253
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,120
Yeah, like a little basement creep.

254
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Okay, well, maybe we could talk about me

255
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,600
being your basement creep.

256
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
Sure, exchange details.

257
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I would love to have a basement creep, yes.

258
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,480
Okay, well, I live in the hold.

259
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,720
That's all the details I can really tell you.

260
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,760
The hold, is that ever on the third street or?

261
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,360
It's like way far outside of town.

262
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,920
There was a street sign once,

263
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,140
but somebody ripped it down and nobody ever fixed it.

264
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, I'll give you my address and one day you'll be there

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,320
and I'll say, oh, there's the basement creep.

266
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,980
That's how I know you found the place.

267
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,440
This plan works out really well for me.

268
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,200
To be honest, I think this works out for the doc too.

269
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,900
You know, it could really use some companies.

270
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,240
He's going a little bit batty.

271
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, well, you know, we're all going a little batty.

272
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,360
I mean, people tell me I'm batty all the time

273
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,040
just because I stand on street corners handing out leaflets.

274
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Leaflets?

275
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,080
Yeah, you want a leaflet?

276
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,920
Here.

277
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,160
If you've got one, of course, yes.

278
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,640
Let me read your literature.

279
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,460
Yeah.

280
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,280
And what's it about, this one?

281
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,680
That one?

282
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,680
That one's about how we need to be teaching kids

283
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,960
about the underground digging

284
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,640
because we're all gonna have to be mole people someday.

285
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,560
Oh my, you're a basement creep after my own heart.

286
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,480
Yes, get the children digging early on.

287
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,280
They might find things in the ground

288
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,000
and that ties directly into my profession.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,580
We need more kids digging in the ground.

290
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,560
Yeah, I'd like to see one of those pamphlets too.

291
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,760
Oh right, you're like a gym guy, right?

292
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,280
I am an anthropologist, archeologist, historian.

293
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,120
Oh.

294
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
But yes, I guess you could call me a gym guy, sure.

295
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,380
We've got some uncut gyms, you know,

296
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,360
that you find there sometimes.

297
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,580
But that's not the real purpose.

298
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,340
The purpose is if we don't teach our kids

299
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,420
to be mole people now, they're gonna be really not used

300
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,440
to living without sunlight.

301
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,920
You know, I kind of thought you might be a little kooky,

302
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,080
but I am 100% in agreement with you

303
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
on the mole people issue.

304
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,440
Well, we could get started with your two kids.

305
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you wanna put them underground?

306
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,240
I desperately want my kids underground.

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,120
Yeah, you could use this pamphlet.

308
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm gonna teach those little fuckers to dig.

309
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,920
Enough about this underground shit.

310
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,120
I've got my eyes up to the skies.

311
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
They call me the Rock Man, if you didn't know that.

312
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
The Rock Man?

313
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
The Rocket Man.

314
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,200
Oh.

315
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,740
Rocket Man.

316
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, I think that's someone else.

317
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, in this universe, there is no piano playing musicians

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,360
at all, except Billy Joel.

319
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
Anyway.

320
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,400
The only piano playing musician in this universe.

321
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,160
Vincente only listens to Billy Joel.

322
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,600
Bach never existed.

323
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,680
It can't be, right?

324
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,320
There must've been a piano player at some point.

325
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Hey, Becca, can you roll a 50-50 up and down roll for me?

326
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,400
If he knows what's good for him.

327
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,520
So if you roll under 50, it'll be a luck success.

328
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,680
If you roll 50 or over, it'll be a luck failure.

329
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,720
Wolfgang Amadeus who?

330
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,240
Those words mean literally nothing to me.

331
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,520
How'd you roll, Becca?

332
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh, sorry, I thought someone else was rolling.

333
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,440
Oh, no, sorry.

334
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,680
47.

335
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,520
That is, hell yeah, that is a success.

336
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,720
And so one of the cleaners comes down

337
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,920
and you see that they open up the front door

338
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,400
and walk over to the van

339
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,240
and they go into the back of the van.

340
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,120
If you continue watching, they pop out of the van

341
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,920
and they're smoking a cigarette

342
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,280
and they get on their phone and start chatting with someone.

343
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,740
I slip out the limousine Escalade

344
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,800
and I creep up behind them

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,720
and I wanna attack by jumping

346
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,720
from flat footed on the ground to onto their shoulders

347
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,240
and put them in a headlock, because I'm pretty small.

348
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,760
Okay, would you rather roll athletics

349
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,520
or unarmed combat for this?

350
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,800
I would like to roll the same thing, doesn't matter.

351
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
A classic would you rather?

352
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,200
Yeah, I wish there was hard success in this game

353
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,240
because I rolled a 12 under 50.

354
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,160
Nice. Nice.

355
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,320
They failed on their check,

356
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,160
so you can easily jump.

357
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,880
Meat Hook, they start sniffing the air as you approach,

358
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,160
but don't look back in time

359
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,160
and suddenly there's a tiny little dirty person

360
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,120
on this cleaner's back and they're on their phone.

361
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,280
Cleaner's worst enemy.

362
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,280
I squeeze their throat with my little arm

363
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,720
until they can't yell anymore.

364
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,960
Okay, go ahead and roll damage.

365
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
So that'll.

366
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,240
I squeeze with my little arm.

367
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Someone who can't yell.

368
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Go ahead and.

369
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,200
Wait, my damage is one D4?

370
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,160
Yeah, one D4 minus one,

371
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,480
and I'll give you an additional D4

372
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,840
because you snuck up on them.

373
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,560
I rolled a four on the first one

374
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,280
and a four on the second one.

375
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,240
This die is busted.

376
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,960
That's, was it minus one for each die?

377
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,000
It is, so with six hit points,

378
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,680
that actually takes down half of their hit points

379
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,360
in one fell swoop,

380
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,760
and they failed their constitution check to stay conscious,

381
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
which works out quite well for your plans.

382
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,280
As this person hits the ground

383
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,040
and their cell phone with it smashes onto the ground

384
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,360
and you just hear a voice coming out.

385
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,240
That's like, Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy.

386
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,440
It was a woman?

387
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,520
Yeah, it was a woman that you jumped on.

388
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I feel like I've, you know, our sisterhood.

389
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,560
I betrayed her.

390
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,920
Well, too late.

391
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,560
Yeah, but you won one for the class struggle.

392
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
She's a-

393
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
Those cleaners.

394
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,880
I know, but urchins. City cleaners.

395
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,240
Urchins are pitted against the working class.

396
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,920
Yeah, but she's got a leg up on me.

397
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,240
I see what you're saying.

398
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,200
Vincente walks over and does she have like a key ring?

399
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,040
You see that there is a key ring

401
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,960
with basically some normal keys,

402
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,800
as well as some like scan cards

403
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,960
that are attached to this ring.

404
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,280
And you see this phone also on the ground that-

405
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,400
Dorothy, Dorothy, should I, what do I do?

406
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,280
I look at Vincenzo, whatever your name is.

407
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,840
Close enough.

408
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,400
Should I pretend to be her?

409
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,240
Hold on.

410
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
Yes.

411
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,720
He rolled to say that.

412
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,560
You had to roll to see

413
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,520
if she should do the name of the podcast.

414
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,080
It could pretend to be people.

415
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,840
No, you can't do that.

416
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,040
Barrel down the camera.

417
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Hi, it's sorry, I think I need a rest.

418
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,840
I was going to say it's me, Dorothy, but I made that one in.

419
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,560
Convince her.

420
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,160
Oh my God, Becca, please roll disguise.

421
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,000
Great.

422
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,840
Yeah, the skill you didn't take.

423
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,200
I added nothing to this skill.

424
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,920
Okay, so that's a 56 and I have a 10%.

425
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,200
That's a big failure.

426
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,040
Oddly enough.

427
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,200
The voice on the other end of the phone is like,

428
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,360
yeah, okay, all right.

429
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Well, I have to take a nap in my van now.

430
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,680
Okay, Dorothy, sleep well.

431
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,160
Wait, can you remind me what we were just talking about?

432
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,920
And that's the scariest thing

433
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,800
this person on the other end has ever heard.

434
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,080
A different voice than their friend, Dorothy,

435
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,080
has taken the phone, says that,

436
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,160
and you hear a deadline on the other end of this.

437
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,720
I think I got away with it.

438
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Very good performance there, Meathook.

439
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,360
Thank you, doctor.

440
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,400
You're going to be a really valuable asset

441
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,760
to the family after this, if you survive.

442
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,400
We don't even know why the cleaners were here.

443
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,840
This kid's going to get us all killed.

444
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,880
Things are really turning around for me.

445
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,880
I already get to be somebody's basement troll.

446
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,120
We're friends, a guy with spats on his shoes,

447
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,720
and this guy's, he's going to let me teach his kids

448
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,800
to dig on the ground.

449
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,800
You really ingratiated yourself with this group.

450
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,760
And to think we almost killed you.

451
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,600
What?

452
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,360
He thinks to himself.

453
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,920
He says out loud.

454
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,760
He says out loud.

455
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,120
You've got an interior monologue problem, I think.

456
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,000
It's just coming out.

457
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080
No one ever tells me no.

458
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Okay, glad we're friends.

459
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,920
He starts swinging the key ring around his finger

460
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,520
and just kind of jaunts into the open door

461
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,840
that Dorothy came out of.

462
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
Did we take Moses up on getting

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
some laminated name tags printed out?

464
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,560
Yeah, what did you want on those?

465
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,520
Mrs. Milk Woman.

466
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,960
Mrs. Milk Woman.

467
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,920
No, I don't know.

468
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
What do you think I should write?

469
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,640
Maybe not that, maybe.

470
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,680
Nobody looks at these things too hard.

471
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,600
Just give me a normal name, you know, like Meat Hook.

472
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,440
Milk Hook.

473
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,280
Milk Hook.

474
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Milk Hook is perfect.

475
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Mine just says Milk Hook one way.

476
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,880
They'll never know who it is.

477
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,760
I'd like my badge to say I'm a cleaner named Dorothy.

478
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
A well-timed flashback.

479
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,120
Oh, do you read minds?

480
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,880
Are you going with cleaners?

481
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,040
Are you going with some sort of governmental agency?

482
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,720
What kind of cover would you have?

483
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,760
Bug spray?

484
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
I think I just want to be a milk tech.

485
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,160
Classic milk tech.

486
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm a milk tester.

487
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,440
I always infiltrate dairy offices as a milk tech crew.

488
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,280
That's right.

489
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,360
So classic milk tech group here.

490
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,920
You got your tester and three texts.

491
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,720
Yeah, and like Luke said,

492
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,840
the door is open and unlocked as you go over there.

493
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,120
I think you're the only one over there with the door open

494
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,640
as you call back to the rest of the group.

495
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,960
Hey, door's open.

496
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,480
Jimmy, can you do something about this body

497
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,520
that I incapacitated?

498
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,040
You got to learn how to deal with those mistakes

499
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,880
on your own.

500
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,160
Damn it, okay.

501
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,760
I put my arms under the armpits

502
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,040
and try and drag her into the back of the van.

503
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,360
Drag her into the van, just like that.

504
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,600
You're a natural.

505
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,920
You're a good father.

506
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,760
Thank you.

507
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,800
You teach, you don't do for it.

508
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,200
You know, you got to teach me to fish.

509
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,200
Hers says milk, hers says milk tech,

510
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,120
your name tag says bean dad.

511
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,720
Bean dad?

512
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,680
I just learned what this was today.

513
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,880
Oh no.

514
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
Bean dad's a wild internet.

515
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
Oh, I remember bean dad.

516
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,960
It's pretty sad.

517
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,600
When she says, teach me to fish, fish face pops his head off.

518
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
Now you fish face.

519
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,120
Okay, sorry.

520
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,000
Wait, fish face?

521
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
Yeah.

522
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,240
You remember that time we were sitting on that dock?

523
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,120
Yeah.

524
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,760
Looking at the moon.

525
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,600
Nevermind.

526
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,440
Nevermind.

527
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,760
It can never work.

528
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,680
Yeah, you're right.

529
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,520
Okay, bye.

530
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,000
Get back in the front seat next to Goomba.

531
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,120
Hey, get over here, Miwok, okay?

532
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,040
All right, let's do it.

533
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Come on, let's hang out.

534
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,520
Okay, Miwok, all right.

535
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
Hey, Goomba, start turning the car around.

536
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,480
It's going to take a while

537
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,880
and we're going to have to get out of here quick.

538
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,200
That's like a 36 point turn.

539
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,200
I would imagine had I ever seen a ridden in cars before.

540
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,640
Wait, hold on, kid.

541
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,960
That's exactly right.

542
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
I think you're a natural.

543
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,840
Wait, are you some kind of math nerd?

544
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,160
No, it's just that, okay, it sounds silly,

545
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,280
but the spirits speak to me.

546
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,560
I think they're from another planet,

547
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,360
but it's more like another dimension.

548
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,840
I got a pamphlet about it.

549
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,680
Here.

550
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,920
Let's review this pamphlet.

551
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,240
Well, maybe we should go into this dairy farm

552
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,800
before whoever was on the line to Dorothy

553
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,520
comes looking for her.

554
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
No, what do these spirits say?

555
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,520
As Vincenti walks into Holy Cow Farms,

556
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,880
he reads aloud, just sometimes spirits talk to me.

557
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, nice.

558
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,840
Fascinating.

559
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,160
Cool, kid.

560
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,000
You're a little out there,

561
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
but I haven't seen anything in these pamphlets

562
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,440
that would disqualify you from a career

563
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,960
in extensive stretch limousineery.

564
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,440
As you guys are looking at the map on the wall

565
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,400
of this office building inside,

566
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,160
it's just got the different names

567
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,240
on which floors they're on.

568
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,920
And you see that Holy Cow Farms is on the eighth floor

569
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,040
of this building, and there are 12 floors total.

570
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
If I look at these other businesses

571
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,600
in having known Hargrave and being a colleague,

572
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,480
are there any other businesses that stand out

573
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
as maybe something else that he would have been

574
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,200
maybe here to look for or into?

575
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Interesting.

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
Go ahead and roll.

577
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
While I think of something.

578
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,160
Yeah, exactly.

579
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,120
Makes a lot more sense than what I had.

580
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,840
I rolled a 49 on a 50 anthropology is what I rolled.

581
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
Okay, yeah, so.

582
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,520
For being aware of the profession.

583
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,520
Not that I'm using an anthropological skill.

584
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,920
With all of your knowledge of the field of anthropology.

585
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,400
Which includes all the articles about Dr. Hargrave

586
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
that he's obsessively like,

587
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,520
he knows the man through his study.

588
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,880
I mean, you see there's like a dermatologist

589
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,400
on the first floor, there's a cafe on the second floor,

590
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,000
on the third floor, there's a psychic

591
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
holding the same floor as a kid's play land.

592
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,760
And on the fourth floor, there's a massage parlor.

593
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,160
On the fifth floor, there's a karaoke place.

594
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,080
There's a bunch of places, none of which stand out to you.

595
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,680
But you're confident that whatever he was looking for

596
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,200
connection wise, it's probably at holy cow farms.

597
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,480
The kids, they're training to be psychic.

598
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,720
Now we know, he was here for the milk.

599
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,560
Which is what the handler had circled

600
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,040
in the name of the scenario.

601
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,720
I bet that's just a red herring.

602
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,120
And on the seventh floor, it says psychic kids.

603
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,280
Psychic children.

604
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,880
Psychic kids in adult play bed.

605
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,360
Play bed.

606
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,840
It just has bigger, it's a ball pit, but with bigger balls.

607
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,920
It's a child's sidekick in a disgusting ball pit.

608
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,720
It's not a bigger pit, it's the balls that are bigger.

609
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,560
Yeah.

610
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
Yeah, the other tracks.

611
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,160
One adult fits in at a time.

612
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,440
Does Trolley's cleaning service

613
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,200
have an office in the building?

614
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,680
No, they seem to have been here cleaning.

615
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,640
Good question.

616
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520
I've done a little detective work.

617
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,960
These cleaners?

618
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
Probably cleaning.

619
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,000
Yes, very good.

620
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Very good deduction, I see why we brought you along.

621
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,120
And as you all get into the elevator,

622
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,760
you see the same kind of sign

623
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,360
with all the different listings for the floors

624
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,720
as well as the buttons on elevators

625
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,680
where you click them to make it go up.

626
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,240
There's also the closed door button,

627
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,480
but it doesn't do anything.

628
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,400
Hey look, there's no 13th floor button in this one.

629
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,400
Yeah, you can't put a 13th floor button in an elevator.

630
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,360
No, especially if there's only 12 stories to it.

631
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,160
And he clicks the eighth button.

632
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I have to go pee really bad, I'm sorry.

633
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,000
Hold it.

634
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,840
Okay, sounds good.

635
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,840
So the elevator doors open and you see a dark office.

636
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,400
We're gonna use the layout for the office office.

637
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,240
Tight.

638
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,080
So in front of you, you see-

639
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,520
A UK or American.

640
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,560
Good question.

641
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,560
I don't know the layout of the UK one nearly as well.

642
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,800
Pretty similar.

643
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,640
That makes sense.

644
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,320
Based on the scripts of the first season.

645
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,040
And so you see the round desk ahead of you,

646
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,120
coat rack on the right.

647
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,760
And yeah, the lights are off.

648
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,440
There seems to be no one here.

649
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,640
You fumble around with the keys.

650
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,760
You're looking at that all through the glass door.

651
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,960
Looking around the keys,

652
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,480
you see that one of the key cards is for Holy Cow Farms.

653
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,720
He sticks it in the keyhole and turns the key.

654
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,800
The light turns green, door opens.

655
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,040
On the other side, you hear the van.

656
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Way outside running still.

657
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,360
It's a loud van.

658
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,160
It's a really loud van.

659
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,160
When the windows are open, it's hot, it's July.

660
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,600
They're trying to air it out.

661
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm glad the windows open on the eighth floor

662
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
of this building.

663
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,560
It would make my job a lot easier

664
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,760
if I came here to do my normal job.

665
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,560
Oh, what sort of line of work are you in?

666
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,720
Window cleaning.

667
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
And you find that to be easier with the windows open?

668
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
Some strange world window cleaning.

669
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,680
I guess I've never thought about it much.

670
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,000
It must be.

671
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,080
Hold on.

672
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,240
With these windows open,

673
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,280
I wonder what they're trying to air out.

674
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,400
Can I do a check for smell?

675
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,320
Yeah, absolutely.

676
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,920
Go ahead and roll alertness or search.

677
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,720
Let's see.

678
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Search.

679
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,200
Nope, it's a 56.

680
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,240
And I needed a 50.

681
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,520
Damn.

682
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,440
Sniffing the air, meat hook,

683
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,960
you smell something burning or burnt.

684
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,880
And Vincent is smoking a cigarette right next to you.

685
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,720
Okay.

686
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
There's a thick smoke next to you.

687
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,160
Obviously share the information.

688
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,280
And you notice that there's a trash can nearby

689
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,280
with a bunch of burnt popcorn that's been tossed into it.

690
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,120
Vincent would like to do a smell with his eyes around.

691
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,640
Yeah, I kind of figured this is a,

692
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,680
there's no one in here that you can see.

693
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,720
So this is going to be kind of an exploration kind of thing.

694
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,840
What are you looking for?

695
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,920
Where are you going?

696
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,080
I'm just kind of wandering through

697
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,680
and just like looking for blood.

698
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,080
What did you roll?

699
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,680
He's just not looking too hard.

700
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,640
Well, you don't find any blood.

701
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Jimmy lets out a huge sigh and he's like,

702
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,920
all right, I'll teach you how to smell.

703
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,800
And he's going to roll an alertness nine.

704
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,640
Yeah, with a nine,

705
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,600
your sniffer smells the exact same cigarette smoke

706
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,520
and burnt popcorn that the others have been smelling.

707
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,520
But your alertness pass shows you to one of the desks nearby

708
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,600
that you see some paperwork strewn about.

709
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,160
And you notice, oh, this is-

710
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,000
It's covered in blood that he missed.

711
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,640
It's hand prints all the way up.

712
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,480
Big bloody arrows on the floor pointing to the desk.

713
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,320
This is help.

714
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,720
No, you see Dr. Brock Hargrave's desk

715
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
here at Holy Cow Farms.

716
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,520
You see a picture of him.

717
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,040
You see lots of papers all over his desk

718
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,360
that have his name on them.

719
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,800
And there is a computer at his workstation

720
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,960
as well as a large file cabinet.

721
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,480
Yeah, you're at his desk.

722
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
You see that there are probably what,

723
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,920
like 14, 16 desks around the office and little pods.

724
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,480
This guy sat in Dwight's desk.

725
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,640
Nice.

726
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,040
Yeah, I pick his phone like of Jell-O, toss it aside.

727
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,880
Doc, I think you better get over here

728
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
and look at some of these files.

729
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,080
Yes, I'm very curious what Brock Hargrave was doing

730
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,680
here at Holy Cow Farms.

731
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,180
And you see a picture of him holding up this artifact

732
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,620
on this expedition that you are in the picture,

733
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,880
you were in the expedition,

734
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,160
but the way he's holding out his arm in gleeful triumph

735
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,080
is blocking your face from being seen in the picture.

736
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,960
Look, see, this is me and Brock.

737
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,080
I promise, that's me there.

738
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,460
You can't quite see my face,

739
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,120
but I was once a person who would go

740
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,520
on these expeditions like this.

741
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,360
It's him, Meat Hook, I was there.

742
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,200
Oh yeah, yeah, no, you got the kind of same chunky middle.

743
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,120
Yeah, I see.

744
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,920
Yes, yes, yes, the chunky middle, yes.

745
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,360
Stand aside, let me look,

746
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,280
and I start rummaging through his papers.

747
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,060
Rummaging through his papers, I'm gonna go pee.

748
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,440
I have to.

749
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,880
Yeah, I was just joking earlier when I said don't pee.

750
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm very sneakily eating.

751
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,200
Do it less sneaky.

752
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,820
You want a mukbang?

753
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,060
You don't know about mukbangs?

754
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,900
No, I do.

755
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,740
We know.

756
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,900
The whole idea, really, I dislike.

757
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
You asked for it.

758
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,580
Crunch.

759
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,100
You can chew as lot as you fucking want.

760
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,340
Boy, that's a whole lot of papers.

761
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,460
It's taking me quite some time to get through these.

762
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,900
Read all his notes while he's gone.

763
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,660
We'll just totally ruin the adventure

764
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,940
and say go exactly where you...

765
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:16,100
Skip to the last page to see who did it.

766
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,540
Now that's the way to choose your own adventure.

767
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,940
I choose to win.

768
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,140
I'm not gonna let a stupid book beat me.

769
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,460
That's what we call Zach.

770
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,180
Becca, I saw that you played Bleak Prospect

771
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,700
with the Glass Cannon crew,

772
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,260
and it was like a week after we had just got done playing it

773
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,980
with Scott Dorwood, the guy who wrote it.

774
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,700
And it was really fun to see you guys do

775
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,020
a totally different...

776
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,780
Oh man, yeah, that was a Bleak one.

777
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,540
That was so fun.

778
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,080
I can't believe you played with Scott Dorwood.

779
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,380
That's amazing.

780
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,860
It was super cool, yeah.

781
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,180
We've played with him a couple of times now.

782
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,060
He's run us through some of his stuff.

783
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,980
He's like our podcast grandpa.

784
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,900
I played with him once.

785
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,400
It hasn't come out yet though.

786
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,100
Did you guys play some Call of Cthulhu?

787
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,620
On an award-winning podcast.

788
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,780
Oh, an award-winning podcast you say?

789
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,220
They won best podcasts at the Innies.

790
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
Nice.

791
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
Was it on The Daily?

792
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,100
It was The Daily.

793
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,780
I played Call of Cthulhu.

794
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,620
I'm Michael Barbaro.

795
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,500
This is Call of Cthulhu.

796
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Here's what else you need to roll today.

797
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,580
Love it.

798
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,300
Boy, it's taken you quite a while

799
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,340
to shuffle through all those papers.

800
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,540
There's just a lot here, it's a lot to get through,

801
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,020
but I'm not seeing exactly...

802
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,340
Emma?

803
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,580
Lights start going off.

804
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,580
Red lights illuminate the entirety of this office.

805
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,140
And a small voice says,

806
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,940
Hello, an intruder has been found here.

807
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,260
Please call the security company if this is an alarm.

808
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,100
Hello, an intrusion has been found here.

809
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Please call security if this was a mistake.

810
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,180
Jeremy, I'm going to try this again.

811
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,460
I've never heard a more confused automated message,

812
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,660
but I'm going to give it a try

813
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,140
and I take the phone out of the jello and press like those.

814
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,580
It says call security if it's a break-in.

815
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,180
If we don't call, the security won't come?

816
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,020
You're right.

817
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,860
I think you're right.

818
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,700
That is correct, yes.

819
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,540
That's what they said.

820
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,220
That is what the voice said very explicitly, yes.

821
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,700
Those were great instincts, Meathook.

822
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
I hang up the phone.

823
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,100
Okay, wow, we really dodged that bullet.

824
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,900
Phew, that was a close one.

825
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,820
Wow, I'm not used to all these indoor lights.

826
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,580
Pfft.

827
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,380
With the flashing red lights

828
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,660
continuing to illuminate your search,

829
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,500
I need everyone who is searching

830
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,180
to go ahead and roll a search check for me.

831
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,580
We'll see what you find in this place.

832
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,860
Ooh, a crit pass.

833
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,420
It's a 22 on a 60.

834
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,300
Well, that will fucking do it, huh?

835
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,420
Vincenty regular passes as he smiles,

836
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,860
knowing that this building

837
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,140
bought one of his security systems.

838
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

839
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,340
Meathook fails.

840
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,260
You know, computers, not my thing.

841
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,420
Are you doing the Zoolander thing on one of them?

842
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,620
And the pages are too big.

843
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,900
Eight and a half by 11,

844
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,860
I need a four by six square leaflet.

845
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,900
I love that.

846
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,180
Scott, you might have a future

847
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,380
in the printing industry too,

848
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,100
if limousining doesn't work out.

849
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,660
Well, thank you.

850
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,500
You've learned a lot about leaflets in your time.

851
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,020
Well, you know, I dabble.

852
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,340
I dabble in zines.

853
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,380
How long have you been dabbling in the anarchy scene?

854
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,300
No, zines with a Z.

855
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,140
Oh, zines.

856
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,260
Zines, which is part of the anarchy scene.

857
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,460
Oh yeah, all my life, baby.

858
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

859
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,660
Okay, so Shelly St. Blythe,

860
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,740
with your critical success,

861
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,100
we're going to come back to you.

862
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,940
Okay.

863
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,300
The success was Vincenti Boeri.

864
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,140
Yes?

865
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,220
Yes.

866
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,700
Thank you.

867
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,460
As you're going through the desk,

868
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,060
you're kind of feeling around

869
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,700
and you feel underneath,

870
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,980
there's this kind of wooden piece that is sticking out.

871
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,020
And when you flick it,

872
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,300
a false bottom comes out from the main drawer of this desk.

873
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,220
When it pops down,

874
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,380
you see it's full of notes about things

875
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,540
that have been brought to Trigate Supply.

876
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,540
You see a map of the city with little dots poking around

877
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,740
in a specific kind of layout at the Zeitgeist,

878
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,180
which is an abandoned space needle here in the city.

879
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,300
That's cool.

880
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,740
Yeah, it is.

881
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,620
Shout out to Dylan B from Deadwood, South Dakota,

882
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,940
for giving us the Zeitgeist.

883
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,780
Nice.

884
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,620
And while we're here,

885
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,860
shout out to Zakharov Salyer,

886
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,700
another $10 up patron for Trigate Supply.

887
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,540
And finally,

888
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,020
you see a handwritten note scrawled on the bottom corner

889
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,420
of one of these pages that says,

890
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,860
Strummer's Crystal, question mark.

891
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,700
Doctor, you know almost as much as this guy,

892
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,820
but definitely not as much about crystals

893
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,820
and stuff found in the earth.

894
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,380
What's this Strummer's thing?

895
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,540
Did you say Strummer's?

896
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,340
You would know that there is a shop in town

897
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,180
called Strummer's Resonating Crystals,

898
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,660
and it is owned by Aaron Strummer.

899
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,060
Shout out to Dale Armont from Arkansas.

900
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,180
Yee-haw.

901
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,300
The land of actual crystal shops.

902
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,780
The land of crystal shops and holy cow farms.

903
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,620
Yeah.

904
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,780
Whoopee.

905
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,620
Whoopee.

906
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,460
Whoopee.

907
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,820
Yes, that's Aaron's establishment.

908
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,380
That's where I do most of my gym shopping.

909
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,380
What could Hargrave want with a gym shop that I frequent?

910
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,460
Is he trying to do me in?

911
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,260
Is he trying to finish me off for good?

912
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Or maybe just prank you.

913
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,780
He really likes to mess around.

914
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,420
I mean, I think you gotta just let this guy stop having...

915
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,580
Obviously we have to finish this mission,

916
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,420
but in general,

917
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,900
this guy needs to have less space in your head.

918
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,300
Shelly needs a minute to clear his head,

919
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,420
and he walks off into the other room

920
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,660
and walks directly into the security room

921
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,660
with some TVs around and different like VHS tapes

922
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,220
lining the wall with different dates on it

923
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,660
and tiny little security TVs that you could play them on.

924
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,620
Nobody here though?

925
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,860
There's nobody here now.

926
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,620
You just walk right into this room.

927
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,140
Looking around,

928
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,140
it just seems to be looking at holy cow farms only,

929
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,460
not the rest of the building.

930
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,300
I kind of turn...

931
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,660
There's only like three cameras in here.

932
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,060
I kind of turn to the rest of the room.

933
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,820
I believe I found the nerve center

934
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,860
for the security operation.

935
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,420
We might be able to see what may have happened that day

936
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,140
that Hargrave left and his coworker disappeared.

937
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,020
Well, if the security system is all my security system,

938
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,380
it's probably not gonna work great,

939
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,420
but we can try.

940
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,540
But it looks so expensive.

941
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,460
It does look expensive, yes.

942
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,300
It is expensive.

943
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,660
It is very expensive, yeah.

944
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,940
You guys keep having this conversation

945
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,460
as the red lights are just like blinking and flashing.

946
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,140
Vincenzi just makes a call.

947
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,460
The lights...

948
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,820
Roll bureaucracy real quick, Vincenzi.

949
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,380
Crit fail.

950
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,020
Oh shit, I thought it was a crit pass.

951
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,380
22 on a 10.

952
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,300
Very cool.

953
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,460
Is there something better than bureaucracy

954
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,780
you could justify?

955
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,820
I'm sure there is.

956
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
How about...

957
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,460
Really feels like it would be bureaucracy.

958
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,220
You seem like you're really trying

959
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,060
to come up with something.

960
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,900
Italian.

961
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,820
It's an Italian security system.

962
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,300
And I speak to the security guys in Italian on the phone.

963
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,940
I'm gonna go with a no.

964
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,700
This is one of those excellent times

965
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,780
when you have to put your foot down and say no.

966
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,260
I love saying yes.

967
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,780
Not a chance in this case.

968
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,260
As you call your own security company,

969
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,500
they have your direct number.

970
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,740
So someone picks up there.

971
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,780
Hey, what's up?

972
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,540
Hey, no one's breaking into the building

973
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,340
that Holy Cow Farms is in.

974
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,140
So turn off the alarm.

975
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,500
Oh, okay.

976
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,380
No, what do you mean?

977
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,340
How do you know?

978
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,180
What do you mean?

979
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,500
Who called you?

980
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,380
I'm sorry to kind of bark up the ladder,

981
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,220
but I feel like maybe following orders

982
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,700
isn't what you hired me to do.

983
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,460
You hired me because I'm a small individual

984
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,660
who thinks of myself, you know?

985
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,500
Damn it.

986
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,220
You'll never make that mistake again.

987
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,060
Fuck.

988
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,900
And he hangs up.

989
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,580
I think you gotta kill that guy.

990
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,420
Fantastic.

991
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,100
Oh, hey, that might be your first job out of here.

992
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,860
Oh.

993
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,540
I call back and get that guy's name.

994
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,340
I thought you were offering this kid

995
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,780
a legitimate job and moon rocks.

996
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,260
Yeah, I've never killed before.

997
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,100
It's not really my thing.

998
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,940
God willing, you'll never have to.

999
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,780
Forget I said anything.

1000
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,980
We'll talk about it afterwards.

1001
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,320
And then he just writes down the guy's name

1002
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,160
that was on the phone.

1003
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,580
We're gonna have a real wacky dynamic

1004
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,620
when we're three grandfathers living.

1005
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,460
Yeah, wack.

1006
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,300
It's Shelly's family.

1007
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,620
Exactly wacky.

1008
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,260
The rat that lives in the basement.

1009
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,500
It's a sitcom.

1010
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,780
Dinner's ready, basement rat.

1011
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,980
As you guys are having this conversation.

1012
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,660
Broccoli again.

1013
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Shelly St. Blythe.

1014
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,700
Now, now.

1015
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,500
Shelly St. Blythe has been dutifully going through

1016
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,740
the different VHS cassettes and finding the day

1017
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,380
that is just from two days ago.

1018
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,820
The day that was the last time

1019
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,840
that Dr. Brock Hargrave had come into Holy Cow Farms

1020
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,860
and the day that his coworker did not ever clock out.

1021
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,880
And you see on the security footage,

1022
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,420
the two of them around, I don't know, 3.30,

1023
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,940
walk into the kitchen area where there's no camera present.

1024
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,780
Damn it.

1025
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,380
It's so important to have a camera in the kitchen.

1026
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,040
You gotta see who steals your yogurt, I imagine,

1027
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,660
if you have a refrigerator.

1028
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,020
That's the prime place where most office thefts occurs,

1029
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,860
the kitchen.

1030
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,780
And except for bathrooms, it's where most accidents occur.

1031
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,940
Yeah.

1032
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,540
And you see Dr. Brock Hargrave at Holy Cow Farms.

1033
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,060
He is wearing the exact same clothes

1034
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,300
that you've always seen him in.

1035
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,300
He is in full-blown field archaeologist gear

1036
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,900
working at this office.

1037
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,260
And a cowboy hat?

1038
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,580
Yep, cowboy hat included.

1039
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,500
And when he walks out of this kitchen area

1040
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,740
back into frame, into the office,

1041
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,380
he is holding an open yogurt container.

1042
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,140
The spoon is just like hanging limply in his other hand,

1043
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,540
his mouth agape as it looks down.

1044
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,540
And the hand with the spoon in it kind of rubs at his belly,

1045
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,980
looks up directly into the security camera,

1046
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,420
turns around, looks back at the room where he came from,

1047
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,940
looks back at the security camera, nervously smiles,

1048
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,780
looking at his belly and rubbing it continuously

1049
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,300
as he walks back.

1050
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,700
And is this the last time we've seen

1051
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,940
this the friend appear again on cameras?

1052
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,920
For the rest of that day and for the next day,

1053
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,260
as you skim through, you do not see this coworker.

1054
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,060
Well, he fucking ate him.

1055
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,340
Shelly, you know this guy.

1056
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,940
Is that his normal sort of behavior?

1057
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,380
I've never seen how he reacts to yogurt himself,

1058
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,260
but no, in general, he does not rub his belly,

1059
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,880
satisfied after a meal.

1060
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,980
The only time I ever saw him rub his belly like that

1061
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,780
was when he ate a man.

1062
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,820
As he is wont to do.

1063
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,180
The more alarming thing is that his friend did not re-emerge.

1064
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,080
That friend could still be somewhere in that kitchen

1065
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,920
as we speak.

1066
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,300
Let's go open the fridge.

1067
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,080
As you guys walk over to the kitchen,

1068
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,220
you hear sirens in the distance through the open windows

1069
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,420
of the eighth floor of this office building.

1070
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,260
Oh, right.

1071
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,840
That time we called security

1072
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,220
and then they clearly knew we were lying.

1073
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,860
And that other time where I took the phone

1074
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,700
and pretended to be someone.

1075
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,700
And now I'm thinking maybe she knew

1076
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,100
I wasn't pretending to be people so good.

1077
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,100
As we all look into the camera.

1078
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,100
Everyone, Jim's the camera, since we're here.

1079
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,620
So quick search the kitchen before we've run.

1080
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,700
I can show y'all how to climb down a fire escape.

1081
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,780
What's the fastest way to the sewers?

1082
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,020
You are definitely going to be able to get out of here

1083
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,900
cleanly if you leave now.

1084
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,740
If you search the kitchen, you're going to maybe risk it.

1085
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,020
Just like a quick pop open the fridge

1086
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,660
to see if there's not a body in there.

1087
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,800
Oh, there's no body in the fridge.

1088
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,260
All right, let's get the fuck out of here.

1089
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,900
Vincenty pulls his gun out of his briefcase

1090
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,940
and wants to look around just a little harder.

1091
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,680
Okay, are the rest of you staying or going?

1092
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,940
I'll scope things out from the roof.

1093
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,780
Even though, let me tell you,

1094
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,640
the fastest way to the sewer is through the toilet.

1095
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,720
Since you asked.

1096
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,060
Vincenty agrees, he's like.

1097
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,900
Vincent.

1098
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,620
We'll flush ourselves down the toilet to escape the cops.

1099
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,580
They'll never expect it.

1100
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,540
In a place like this,

1101
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,180
they might have an industrial sized one.

1102
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,460
They got cows here.

1103
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,300
For Kevin.

1104
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,780
They've got cow shitters here, I'm sure of it.

1105
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,020
Here in the office office,

1106
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,740
on the eighth floor of this office building.

1107
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,340
Yes, definitely.

1108
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,420
Well, yeah, that's why there's not cow shit everywhere.

1109
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,940
That's exactly right, because the cow shitter,

1110
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,700
the single one.

1111
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,460
Okay, so are we flushing ourselves down this cow shitter?

1112
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,180
Are we running out the back door?

1113
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,260
Looking at this slightly large toilet,

1114
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,900
do you think, I don't know if I'm gonna live.

1115
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,320
Vincenty wants to look in the kitchen first.

1116
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,540
Go ahead and roll search, I suppose.

1117
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,520
Yeah, he thinks back to all of the crimes

1118
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,100
he has cleaned up in kitchens.

1119
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,940
Natch.

1120
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,340
And he's like, I've never committed a crime

1121
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,660
in a kitchen, I guess.

1122
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,780
We can't hear you, we're far down the cow shitter.

1123
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,620
That's right.

1124
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,540
Wait, where'd you guys go?

1125
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,260
You guys take off running out of this office,

1126
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,420
closing the door behind you.

1127
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,520
Is anyone trying to clean up any of the mess

1128
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,780
that you've made since you've been here,

1129
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,740
shoving everything kind of back where it was?

1130
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,260
The only mess would be Hargrave's desk, right?

1131
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,100
That's right, yeah.

1132
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,260
Then yeah, probably as we're running past it,

1133
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,420
he would try to at least close up the secret panel

1134
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,820
that had the stuff inside it.

1135
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,640
Done.

1136
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,700
And you guys head down the hallway,

1137
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,460
you're taking the stairs to the elevator.

1138
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,300
Smart, elevator's out when the alarm's on.

1139
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,300
I'll meet you guys down there, I'm taking the elevator.

1140
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,140
No, I'm not really.

1141
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,340
You click the button.

1142
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,840
I comically grabbed the doctor by his shirt,

1143
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,960
falling down the stairs.

1144
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,740
Eight floors down.

1145
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,500
Go ahead and roll athletics.

1146
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,420
Well.

1147
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,980
Everybody, everybody, everybody, athletics.

1148
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,420
This is what I'm made for.

1149
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,660
Nope.

1150
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,540
With the doctor on my back, I trip.

1151
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,500
Oh no, did we all fail?

1152
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,340
I failed.

1153
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,700
I failed.

1154
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,400
I forgot to eat any food for days.

1155
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,240
For some dry ramen.

1156
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,100
And now I'm out of energy.

1157
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,800
Vincenti passes.

1158
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,140
Oh, he just fucking dies?

1159
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,500
Oh, wait.

1160
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,580
You definitely run down the stairs easy peasy

1161
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,140
and you look back and we're all just like

1162
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,580
hanging off the railing in awkward angles.

1163
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,140
Just exhausted, covered in flop sweat

1164
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,980
as you've made it down the end of this

1165
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,980
un-air conditioned stairwell in July heat here in the city.

1166
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,260
It is sweltering and you all are dripping mops

1167
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,860
when you arrive at the bottom.

1168
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,260
In the meantime, I turn around and saw

1169
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,580
that they were not gonna make it out quick enough.

1170
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,260
So, Vincenti runs out the door they came in.

1171
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,100
Yep.

1172
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,860
Runs a couple streets down and fires off

1173
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,660
a couple shots on his gun.

1174
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,940
That is a long turn that you just did.

1175
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,680
Yeah, you ran two blocks.

1176
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,100
A block away.

1177
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,800
I wanna draw attention elsewhere.

1178
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,220
Okay, sounds good.

1179
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:08,780
So, Vincenti, you are a block away,

1180
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,180
away from the parking lot

1181
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,460
and you are firing your gun in the air

1182
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,780
as the rest of you get into the...

1183
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,580
To like the level five is on the wall.

1184
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,860
It feels a lot faster when you take the elevator.

1185
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,380
Trust me, it's not.

1186
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,000
This way is a lot speedier.

1187
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,680
I feel like I should have been able to do this.

1188
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,980
This is the thing I'm good at.

1189
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,100
Yeah, me too.

1190
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,940
But we've got the doctor care like stretched between us.

1191
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,780
Oh yeah.

1192
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,340
Believe it or not, I'm pretty fit for my age.

1193
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,100
I just am having trouble today.

1194
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,500
65.

1195
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,340
Okay.

1196
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,460
I've never been in that good a shape.

1197
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,780
I just got lucky today.

1198
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,300
Which explains why you are far off.

1199
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,860
You see sirens in the distance, they turn

1200
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,420
and as they're heading down the street

1201
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,940
that would lead them to the parking lot

1202
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,540
for this exact reasoning, they hear the gunshots

1203
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,020
and immediately make a turn

1204
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,000
and begin heading in your direction.

1205
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,340
You also see the stretch Escalade

1206
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,140
pull up to the front of the office building.

1207
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,740
I ran in to grab my Jeep.

1208
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,420
You sprint across the parking lot to your Jeep

1209
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,560
as these sirens are getting closer

1210
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,260
and they are barreling down on Vincente Bowery.

1211
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,660
He puts his gun back in his briefcase

1212
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,060
and just walks towards the Escalade casually.

1213
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,340
I mean, you did a sacrifice move for the other three

1214
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,500
and so the security car pulls up in front of you

1215
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,940
and the window rolls down and I want you to roll

1216
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,220
a charisma real quick right off the bat.

1217
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,380
Actually, no, don't roll.

1218
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,780
Tell me what your charisma is.

1219
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,620
Passive.

1220
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,440
80.

1221
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,780
Jesus Christ.

1222
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,500
Yeah, could my 80 athletics have gotten me

1223
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,660
a passive success to go down the stairs?

1224
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,540
No.

1225
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,900
No.

1226
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,900
And so the security guy rolls down the window

1227
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,180
and is like, hey there mister, did you see anyone

1228
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,620
firing off a gun up in the air over?

1229
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,820
And he points right to where you just were

1230
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,420
like two minutes ago.

1231
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,260
Bitch face?

1232
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,080
Yeah.

1233
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,920
You know what I mean?

1234
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,920
Yeah, I saw, it was a super, super tall guy

1235
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,280
with like super long hair and really huge long fingernails

1236
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,160
and he wasn't wearing any clothes and he screamed,

1237
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,020
I'm gonna run all the way that way.

1238
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:55,020
And he took off running in the opposite direction

1239
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,620
of where I, I heard him say he's going that way.

1240
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,540
I said, I'm getting way far away from him, he's scary.

1241
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,500
And so that's why I'm walking this way.

1242
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,080
Anyway, you better go get him.

1243
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,580
I think with your 80 charisma and just seeing

1244
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,420
the vision of you.

1245
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,500
And it was such a good lie.

1246
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,100
It was such a good lie.

1247
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:20,180
Also, this was before I started hiring smart people

1248
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,660
to work for me and this was just one of the goons

1249
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:24,460
that works for my security company.

1250
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,620
Yeah, the inside of every one of the security cars

1251
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,780
has a picture of you hanging from the rear view mirror

1252
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,420
to remind them who they work for.

1253
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,620
And the logo is like a badge with his face on it.

1254
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:42,700
And he's like, oh, oh, you're, wow, I didn't think

1255
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,140
I'd get delicious information from my boss

1256
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,140
not like tonight.

1257
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,620
You better go catch him.

1258
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,060
And immediately pedal to the metal

1259
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,900
and press his boss.

1260
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,660
I can't do everything around here.

1261
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,020
Perfect getaway.

1262
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,380
Clean as a whistle.

1263
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,580
You see, you see there's the van.

1264
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,500
There seems to be like some rummaging about

1265
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,740
in the cleaning van that is parked right outside

1266
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,580
the front of this office building as you're walking over

1267
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,020
to meet the stretch escalate that is now meeting you

1268
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,860
in the parking lot.

1269
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,860
Did any like mops or brooms happen to fall out

1270
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,540
of the back of that van when the doors were open

1271
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,780
during the struggle?

1272
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,620
Dozens.

1273
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,340
Multiple dozens.

1274
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,060
It is, you know, an office building.

1275
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,460
There's a lot of cleaning.

1276
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,820
A lot of sweeping up, a lot of mopping.

1277
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,460
You need a different broom for each room.

1278
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,380
I mean, yeah, the van, the cleaning van was open

1279
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,220
at one point.

1280
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,220
Yeah, and dozens of mops and brooms fell out.

1281
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,380
I grab, I grab a broom.

1282
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,780
I know that this isn't how car doors work,

1283
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,860
but I stick it in the, in the handle.

1284
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,180
So she can't get out of the back of the van.

1285
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,940
Oh, is that what the rummaging was?

1286
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,860
I thought the police were another like detail.

1287
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,900
No, just someone coming to inside.

1288
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,100
Gotcha, gotcha.

1289
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,980
So I do that and it works.

1290
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,380
Oh, congratulations.

1291
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,060
I want to talk through the door.

1292
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,060
Hey, Dorothy.

1293
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,140
You guys are now pulled up next to this cleaning van

1294
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,260
and you've pulled up in such a way to where

1295
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,540
that she can't get out of the driver's side,

1296
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,300
which is the seat that she's kind of gotten herself into.

1297
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,300
And she's looking at you kind of horror,

1298
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,820
trying to figure out whether she should roll

1299
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,020
down the window or not.

1300
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,180
Roll it down.

1301
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,900
Have you any Grey Poupon?

1302
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:41,420
I always wanted to say that.

1303
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,260
Oh yes.

1304
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,100
Very good one.

1305
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:46,940
Very good one.

1306
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,780
And she just lifts up a bottle of Evian

1307
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,420
and holds it up to you.

1308
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,260
Calm down.

1309
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,100
Is that poison?

1310
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,140
Don't, don't do it Dorothy.

1311
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,620
What's the pH?

1312
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,220
Cause I can tell you some things.

1313
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,620
You see a TED talk about like water levels?

1314
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,540
Sweetie, I am your TED talk.

1315
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,140
Now tell me, what were you here cleaning up?

1316
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,420
Cause I know a company like Trolley's,

1317
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,580
they don't do your normal messes.

1318
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,140
Do you want a taste of this arm around your neck

1319
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:19,980
one more time?

1320
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,100
She rolls up the window quickly.

1321
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,740
Don't do that.

1322
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,620
Don't do that Dorothy.

1323
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,580
Rolling it back up.

1324
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,500
Rolling it back up.

1325
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,660
Normal cleaning.

1326
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,260
Just a regular cleaning, huh?

1327
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,940
It breaks down, starts crying.

1328
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,140
You guys can roll him it.

1329
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,420
Dorothy the kid's right.

1330
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,300
You don't need all these brooms and mops

1331
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,700
for normal cleaning.

1332
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,540
I failed a 19 on a 10.

1333
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,380
Damn.

1334
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,980
I failed as well.

1335
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:47,820
I failed real bad.

1336
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,660
Damn, damn, damn.

1337
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,500
Damn, damn, damn, damn.

1338
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,100
She seems like she's fine.

1339
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,940
She's just crying.

1340
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,900
She's like, it's real cleaning.

1341
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,300
Well, I don't know why anybody would lie about that.

1342
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,700
I don't know what else she can teach us.

1343
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,060
No, I'm not a, I'm not doing a TED talk.

1344
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,580
I don't have your grapefruit pot.

1345
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,820
I just have it in me yard.

1346
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,500
That was a joke, Dorothy.

1347
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,660
Just a joke.

1348
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,500
Okay.

1349
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,940
Will you leave?

1350
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,780
Yeah.

1351
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,660
Should we go to the crystal store?

1352
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,260
Should we go to the, the doc's house?

1353
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,940
Well, there's also Tri-gate supply.

1354
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,460
That is also true.

1355
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,300
Good thinking.

1356
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,740
Plus this map we got with this space needle.

1357
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,580
It's abandoned.

1358
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,700
It does seem like his search was concentrated

1359
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,260
within that area exactly.

1360
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,060
Perhaps we would find more there.

1361
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,900
Is any of that stuff near his house?

1362
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,980
Oh yeah.

1363
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,060
Oh yeah.

1364
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,140
Oh yeah.

1365
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,100
For sure.

1366
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,820
People don't go too far out their neighborhood

1367
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,060
here in the city, or at least Dr. Brock Hargrave

1368
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,260
seems to stay within his area around his house.

1369
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,380
I also have a close personal relationship

1370
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,540
with Aaron Strummer so I could give him a call

1371
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,340
while we're on our way to another site.

1372
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,100
All right, let's check out the house first

1373
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,780
and you call this Aaron boy.

1374
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,660
He is an Aaron boy of sorts, yes.

1375
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,500
Now doc, you be real cool when you call him.

1376
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,300
Don't get on a rant about Hargrave.

1377
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,300
Don't talk about how he's been seen shopping around

1378
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,100
where you shop, or do, but just don't,

1379
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:16,940
don't get angry about it.

1380
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,780
I was gonna say that's kind of my inroad.

1381
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,380
Yeah, that is the entire line of questioning, I understand.

1382
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,060
Do you have any of these crystals you can maybe

1383
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,340
put your bad negative energy into

1384
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,820
before you give him a call?

1385
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,220
Yeah, if any of your crystals have been charging.

1386
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,220
Oh, I always have them charging

1387
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,260
at least when the phase of the moon aligns, of course.

1388
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,500
I wouldn't charge a lapis lazuli

1389
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,860
on a waxing crescent, of course.

1390
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,700
No, that'd be stupid.

1391
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,020
Ridiculous, but I do have this tiger's eye here

1392
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,820
and it is charged.

1393
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,540
I'd say this is the prime time to be using that.

1394
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,860
Wait a minute, doc, has he ever met Craig?

1395
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,980
He has not met Craig Mile, no.

1396
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,060
Perhaps Craig could call as a potential customer.

1397
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,500
That's a great idea.

1398
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,380
A career-defining performance, yes.

1399
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,060
It's gonna be tough, doc, but I know you can do it.

1400
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,500
You're a real artist with those things,

1401
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,020
no matter how much they get in the way on the missions.

1402
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,820
I'll do this, but in the meantime,

1403
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,180
we are on our way to Hargrave's home.

1404
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,540
Is that what we decided, or was it the Space Needle?

1405
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,620
Hargrave's home.

1406
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,300
I see the Space Needle is kind of

1407
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,740
potentially an epic conclusion.

1408
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,580
Yeah.

1409
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,940
It seems like a very dramatic location.

1410
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,500
Then yeah, so that's on our way then.

1411
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,660
Boing, boing.

1412
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,220
Strummer's Crystals, this is Arren speaking.

1413
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,060
Arren?

1414
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,100
Hello, hello Arren.

1415
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,140
Yes, no, this is Arren.

1416
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,140
Arren, this is a friend of Mr. St. Blythe.

1417
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,860
He told me to call you.

1418
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,300
Oh yes, that adds up.

1419
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:02,300
Mr. St. Blythe always calls me Arren.

1420
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,260
He's a bit of a, you know.

1421
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,700
And St. Blythe is giving big eyes to everybody in the car.

1422
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,820
Am I on the right track?

1423
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:13,660
Just keep going, just keep going.

1424
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,820
Thumbs up, all right.

1425
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:15,980
You are the puppet.

1426
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,900
You might have gotten me confused with my brother Arren.

1427
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,620
Oh, either one I think works if your last name is

1428
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,060
Strummer.

1429
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,860
Strummer, and that's the name on the door, right?

1430
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,260
That's the one, yes.

1431
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,260
Arren Strummer's Resonating Crystals,

1432
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,940
though it doesn't say Arren,

1433
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,660
just says Strummer's Resonating Crystals above the door

1434
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,300
and on all of my marketing.

1435
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,580
But you see, I'm a mutual friend there of Mr. St. Blythe

1436
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,340
and one Brock Hargrave.

1437
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:50,020
And we were trying to discern if he's been in lately.

1438
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,980
What was the name?

1439
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,620
I'm not supposed to say these kinds of things,

1440
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:56,700
but I love tea, so spill it if you must.

1441
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,180
It's Brock Hargrave.

1442
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,100
Brock Hargrave, let me look through.

1443
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,780
No, no, I'm not seeing this name anywhere on my list.

1444
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,940
Ask him if anything's gone missing lately.

1445
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,740
Have you had anything, you know,

1446
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,500
that of maybe great value or historical significance

1447
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,460
go missing lately?

1448
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,100
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, go Craig, go Craig.

1449
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,780
I mean, that's something,

1450
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,980
that sounds like something that, you know,

1451
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,700
St. Blythe would say, right?

1452
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,620
Oh, disguise.

1453
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,300
Also, I want the two criminals

1454
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,660
and the mercenary to roll criminology.

1455
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,100
I would like to roll my puppet skill, thank you.

1456
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,940
Yes, please roll your puppet skill.

1457
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,700
Oh, fuck.

1458
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,900
I got a seven.

1459
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,980
That's definitely a pass. Oh, fuck yeah, nice.

1460
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,300
I fail a 49 on a 40 puppetry.

1461
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,220
Damn, we probably shouldn't have done a FaceTime.

1462
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,060
I failed my criminology roll.

1463
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,260
He's made the puppet hang up.

1464
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,900
Yeah, I failed my criminology roll too.

1465
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,300
I guess take off your headphones,

1466
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,940
the three of you that are in the room.

1467
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:09,020
And Becca, since you succeeded on your criminology check,

1468
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:11,420
this is knowledge that will just be for you.

1469
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,340
Oh, I get a secret.

1470
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,220
Wait, you're in the same room?

1471
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,820
They're all doing this thing

1472
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,500
where they put their fingers in their ears

1473
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,980
and then rub them around to make the consistent noise

1474
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,780
to not hear my voice.

1475
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,020
Excellent.

1476
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:27,380
It also hurts their ears the longer we talk.

1477
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,380
So, Becca, it actually makes a ton of sense

1478
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,500
that me hook would know Aaron Strummer,

1479
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,220
which is Aaron Strummer's brother.

1480
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,980
And Aaron Strummer isn't a purveyor of crystals

1481
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,500
at the resonating crystal shop.

1482
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,820
He is a seller of crystal methamphetamine.

1483
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,500
Yeah, I know a guy.

1484
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,140
I know, yeah, I know that guy.

1485
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,340
That's the guy that I know.

1486
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,100
Yep, that's the guy that you know.

1487
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,660
And this kind of comes to you

1488
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,300
as this conversation is happening on the phone.

1489
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:05,300
Not for me, but many people at the hold

1490
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,300
know a thing about that.

1491
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:12,300
So, who is this that I'm speaking to then?

1492
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,420
It's Craig Mile.

1493
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:19,420
Yeah, are you sure this isn't some sort of

1494
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:24,100
crystalline knowledgeable man,

1495
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,700
some sort of client of mine?

1496
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,260
Ask him where his brother is.

1497
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,580
I was wondering if I could speak to your brother.

1498
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,620
Aaron, let me see if he's here.

1499
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:38,260
Oh, Aaron.

1500
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:42,380
Let me remind you, it's like 9.45 p.m. now at night

1501
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,660
and you called the crystal shop.

1502
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,260
That's like their busiest hour.

1503
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:51,700
Oh yes, all right, he'll be here.

1504
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,020
Yes, he's coming, he's coming.

1505
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,580
Hey y'all, who is this?

1506
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,380
Oh, it's Aaron, is it?

1507
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,140
Yes, Aaron, who called for me?

1508
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,540
I think you should give me the phone, actually.

1509
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,100
I've got someone here who would like to speak to you.

1510
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,340
It's, hang on.

1511
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,060
He can see me, it's FaceTime.

1512
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,940
Yeah, you just hold the phone right there, doc.

1513
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,140
Is that, is this?

1514
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,780
You know me, Stromer, but don't say my name.

1515
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,180
Oh, nice, intimidation over FaceTime.

1516
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,020
Immediately though, like, okay.

1517
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,100
You owe me a favor.

1518
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,820
Oh, okay, like I owe you a favor after the last time?

1519
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,620
Yeah, that wasn't my fault while we went down.

1520
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:33,580
Yeah, telling me that that little fish fella of yours

1521
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,700
isn't still hanging about?

1522
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,780
You're not still protecting him?

1523
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,580
Yeah, we scoot him out of the frame.

1524
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,980
Fish face?

1525
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,820
Fish face, shut your fucking mouth.

1526
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,860
Fish face.

1527
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:46,220
Haven't seen him.

1528
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,860
Don't know anything about his whereabouts.

1529
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,620
He's not at the hold, that's for sure.

1530
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,340
But you know who is?

1531
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,300
A lot of your former clients.

1532
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,100
Yeah, so what, what's it to you?

1533
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:01,020
All they need is one rock slipped in their water

1534
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:04,220
and they'll be back on the choo-choo train.

1535
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,300
You know what I mean?

1536
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,140
Yes, I understand what you mean.

1537
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,580
What do you want?

1538
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:14,660
I wanna know what you know about Dr. Brock Hargrave,

1539
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,460
cause he had some questions for you.

1540
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,140
Questions like, can he get some more?

1541
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:20,980
What do you want?

1542
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,340
He's trying to get some crystal.

1543
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:24,420
I don't know what you want.

1544
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:27,260
Dr. Brock Hargrave is on the crystal?

1545
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,220
Why wouldn't he be?

1546
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,460
Yeah, no, I guess we are in the city.

1547
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,860
Oh, you think my crystal's not good enough for a doctor?

1548
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:34,900
Should've known better.

1549
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,140
Took me a while to kick the habit.

1550
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:42,140
Why would it be any different for some hob-nosing jungle

1551
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:47,420
seeking cat piss smelling cowboy hat wearing guy?

1552
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,580
Well, if he smells like cat piss,

1553
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,220
he's probably, you know, I don't know.

1554
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,860
Maybe that's why he hasn't made another order in a while.

1555
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,500
Trying to make his own.

1556
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,860
Okay, well maybe tell me when the last order he got was.

1557
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,580
I don't know, like two weeks ago.

1558
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,740
Weeks, hmm, okay.

1559
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,220
Doesn't help me, man.

1560
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,420
Doesn't help me.

1561
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,300
Y'all got any questions for this fella?

1562
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,180
I turn the camera around.

1563
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,940
This is everybody in our car, by the way,

1564
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,860
in case, don't tell anybody what the place guys call me.

1565
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,700
Hello.

1566
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,420
Hey, it sounds like you guys are still here.

1567
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,500
I'm Jimmy Corrigan, this is Dr. Shelley,

1568
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,980
and this is Craig.

1569
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,180
There's also a mob man whose name keeps changing.

1570
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,460
It's been Vincente the almost the whole time.

1571
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,900
Nearly the whole time, but.

1572
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,140
Nearly the whole time.

1573
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,780
It sounds like maybe you're selling drugs in my city.

1574
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:39,580
Yeah, are you selling crystals or crystal?

1575
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,020
I think you want to talk to my brother, Oren, maybe.

1576
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,020
He sells crystals.

1577
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:43,860
Yeah, but.

1578
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,300
And you sell crystal methamphetamine.

1579
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,740
But that was a different conversation

1580
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,780
I was trying to have with, you know,

1581
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,660
I'm not gonna say a name.

1582
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,860
I picked up on it pretty fucking quick,

1583
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,860
and we're gonna have to have a separate conversation

1584
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:59,540
outside of this because either I get a cut or you get cut.

1585
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,820
That seems fair.

1586
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:05,300
His eyes get pretty big and he's like, good to know.

1587
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,140
Good to know.

1588
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,140
I will be in touch.

1589
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:07,980
So you've been, what?

1590
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,460
You've been selling this shit to Hargrave?

1591
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,900
Yeah, so what?

1592
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,700
A perversion of crystals.

1593
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,820
Aaron, I think you need to tell people around town

1594
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:21,980
that Meat Hook is in with some classy folks now.

1595
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,620
I got shackles on my shoes or whatever she said.

1596
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,380
Yeah, you can see.

1597
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,580
We're a classy bunch.

1598
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,900
And if you keep selling, to our friend Meat Hook.

1599
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,660
You're gonna what?

1600
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,580
Hurt you.

1601
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,820
You look like a scary guy.

1602
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,620
So I'm not gonna mess with you, okay?

1603
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:43,820
I'm not gonna mess.

1604
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,980
In fact, I'll stop.

1605
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:47,820
I'll stop selling drugs.

1606
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:50,540
I don't know, it sounds like maybe we could benefit

1607
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,380
from each other.

1608
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,300
I'll call you later.

1609
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:54,980
You don't have to stop.

1610
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,820
You just gotta cut me in on it.

1611
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,900
I'll just keep doing what I'm doing and we'll talk later.

1612
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,900
Does he like to do drugs up in a tall tower?

1613
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,700
Does he like to do drugs up in a tall,

1614
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,780
I don't know what you're talking, I mean,

1615
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,260
oh, you're talking about his, the zeitgeist?

1616
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,100
You ever go to the zeitgeist?

1617
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,660
His crazy, yeah, where he's doing all the digging.

1618
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:12,500
Yeah.

1619
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,660
He's doing digging in a tower in the sky?

1620
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,100
He's got my children digging at the zeitgeist.

1621
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,860
I don't know, last time I went out there,

1622
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,140
I was like trying to maybe, you know,

1623
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:28,820
boom, just be a good fella and drive it out to him,

1624
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,820
you know, and I happened to see what he was doing out there,

1625
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,940
doing some digging with his sharp shovel.

1626
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,580
By the space needle?

1627
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,620
Yeah, you know, zeitgeist.

1628
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,500
Sharp shovel, doc, it sounds like him.

1629
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,980
It's a telltale sign, he never leaves home without it.

1630
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,780
Would Vincente know if there's a,

1631
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,820
like a telescope in this tower?

1632
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,660
