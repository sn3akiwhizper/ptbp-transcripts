0	2700	Howdy-do, my wolf pups.
2700	6500	It's your rootin' tootin' DJ Wolf the dog.
6500	8660	Emphasis on the tootin'.
8660	11500	I have horrible bowel issues.
11500	13780	Please send some tootin' medicine
13780	17560	into the interdimensional hallways, I wonder.
17560	22360	But I will not let my passive massive gas emissions
22360	24400	ruin this transmission,
24400	29400	which is broadcastin' live from 694.2 PTBP.
30560	35080	I think I smell somethin' funky.
35080	37720	We must have a new Howlin' with Wolf.
37720	40440	This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Mason
40440	43960	in Orlando, Florida, who tweeted about the show
43960	46320	and tagged that pretending pod,
46320	49100	a thing you will also do the next time
49100	50740	you are on the Twitter.
50740	55120	Mason writes, the Yatil Arts Foundation
55120	58700	would like to invite you for a one-night-only performance
58700	61580	of the show that everyone is talkin' about,
61580	64460	Leroy and Juwan.
64460	69220	Join classically trained performers like Liberty Siegel,
69220	73900	Isa Al-Barsoumi, and Craig O'Doul
73900	78540	as they transport you to the magical realm of Carcosa
78540	80620	through the unforgettable songs
80620	85620	and legendary choreography of the 1895 classic.
86060	87780	Tickets are goin' fast,
87780	91200	so hurry to your local performin' arts center.
91200	95620	If you see the yellow sign, you're in the right place.
95620	99460	Huh, well, Mason, I think I'm gonna have to start
99460	101700	gettin' my producer to start proofin'
101700	104020	some of these Howlin' with Wolfses,
104020	106900	because some of y'all just send the wildest shit
106900	109020	and it truly does scare me.
109020	112100	Mason, I hope your weird performin' arts thing
112100	114060	is fun and not creepy.
114060	117400	It better not be creepy and weird, Mason.
117400	120180	If you wanna write up somethin' for your wolf to howl,
120180	123020	tag at PretendingPod on the internet
123020	125980	or write a five-star review on Apple Podcasts
125980	127560	and let us know about it.
127560	129780	If you wanna find Scott on Twitter
129780	133860	or hang out with the cast and other listeners on Discord
133860	137260	or listen to some of Justin's incredible score,
137260	140000	then friendship ended with Zelda,
140000	142480	now Link is my best friend,
142480	146000	and all the Links are in the show notes.
146000	149480	And what does Link say when he meets one of a set
149480	152640	of explicit or understood regulations
152640	154840	or principles governing conduct
154840	158600	within a particular activity or sphere?
158600	160320	Hi, rule.
160320	165160	Fuck Ganondorf Dragmire, it's time for the news.
165160	169260	Last time, Elden Ring ended up dancin' with a woman
169260	173060	whose mind was already owned by some force greater
173060	177000	than Elden had ever met, such force that Chequers,
177000	180040	Elden's leader, had to pull out smell insults
180040	182680	to bring the psychic back to reality.
182680	186980	Lafayette J. Honeycutt teased his own invention
186980	189900	as he and his man, Harvey Brewer,
189900	193380	climbed up a frozen ladder to the top of the tower
193380	198040	adorned with Cicero Mordaunt's strange aerial antennae.
198040	201480	While up there, Harvey saw somethin' indescribable
201480	204580	flyin' through the winter storm and toward the house.
204580	207840	But at the very end of the last episode,
207840	210640	Elden Ring basically pledged allegiance
210640	213760	to this unimaginable power that has taken hold
213760	217960	of the guests here, and when Chequers brought him back again
217960	221560	the changed psychic stared into the pitch black eyes
221560	224240	of Reverend Nye, who winked.
224240	226520	If that doesn't give you shivers,
226520	228520	then you need to release the tension
228520	230520	in your jaw and shoulders.
230520	232800	Here, maybe this'll help.
232800	235740	It's Isabelle Crane with Hollow.
237480	242480	I didn't know a body could be hollow
244200	248200	before its blood ran cold.
249200	254200	I didn't know that the wind could sew
256200	261200	through tissue and faggot bone.
263200	268200	You were hollow when you spoke to me.
271200	276200	Hollow when you sang.
279200	284200	I thought you might be starvin'
286200	291200	so I gave you everything.
295200	298200	Who would like to recount what happened last time?
298200	301200	Oh shit, welcome to pretending to be people!
301200	304200	Psychic attack, psychic attack, psychic attack!
305200	309200	If it's dark, look in the window and there's a face there.
309200	313200	If you're stoned right now and it's dark outside,
313200	315200	don't look in the window.
315200	319200	Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.
319200	323200	There's not someone in your closet you don't have to check.
323200	325200	But there is somebody in the backseat of your car.
325200	328200	Oh!
328200	331200	That's why the car behind you keeps flashing their brides.
331200	333200	Oh no.
333200	335200	Listen to podcasts while driving, cut this bit.
335200	336200	No!
336200	339200	Put in honking noises.
339200	340200	Yeah, put in sirens.
340200	341200	Sirens.
341200	343200	Oh my god, that happened to me the other day.
343200	346200	It made me so angry and it was another actual play.
346200	348200	That wasn't fun for me.
348200	349200	It scared me.
349200	350200	I don't like cops.
350200	352200	Alright, so...
352200	354200	Yeah, in the words of John Lennon,
354200	358200	Get a job, cop!
358200	364200	And we are here in the pretending to be people episode
364200	367200	with a special guest named Scott Dormerd.
367200	369200	Scott, thank you for joining us once again.
369200	371200	Oh, my pleasure, gents. My pleasure.
371200	373200	How do you think it's going so far?
373200	377200	It's accelerating nicely and I am looking forward to doing horrible things to all of you.
377200	378200	Nice!
378200	379200	Yeah, we're gonna die.
379200	383200	Our bodies are ready.
383200	388200	Hey, Zach, big thanks for taking that huge luck hit for me in the last one.
388200	389200	I'm a team player.
389200	390200	What are you at now?
390200	392200	I am down to two.
392200	394200	No, I'm just kidding. I have 51.
394200	395200	Oh, shit.
395200	396200	After all that?
396200	397200	You'll be fine.
397200	398200	You had mad luck.
398200	399200	Okay.
399200	400200	Yeah, 65 luck.
400200	401200	Wow.
401200	403200	You won't need luck for anything else in this scenario.
403200	411200	I'm at 32 right now, so I could still survive an atomic blast, but just barely.
411200	414200	I would have been at 32 if you hadn't taken it for me.
414200	416200	Oh, well, you're welcome, my dear sir.
416200	418200	I'm still sitting pretty at 65.
418200	420200	You need to start doing more crazy shit.
420200	422200	I'm currently wrecking alien technology.
422200	425200	I think I'm gonna start having to use some luck.
425200	429200	So, yeah, last time we left off, you guys were in the tower.
429200	430200	Destroying.
430200	434200	We had discovered the secret of Mordent's Tower thanks to Zach's luck sacrifice,
434200	439200	and the secret was it was set up to receive some kind of alien transmissions.
439200	440200	Or send, I think.
441200	442200	Send, okay, yes.
442200	447200	Possibly some sort of psychic thing, encouraging people to enjoy the invention.
447200	453200	Yeah, meanwhile, Checkers is chatting it up with an heiress to a fortune.
453200	456200	A real Greg over there.
456200	459200	I'm pulling a Greg, and then...
459200	461200	Succession reference.
461200	464200	Yeah, the senator still haven't talked to him.
464200	467200	Have yet to talk to the senator from Vermont.
467200	473200	I doubt that we'll be able to get to a psychic attack, psychic attack on him, because...
473200	474200	Why, Zach?
474200	477200	Well, Elden Ring, which is my full name.
477200	479200	Use it or lose it.
479200	483200	He's like, losing is an option. Please, please, lose it.
486200	488200	I think it's a really fun joke.
488200	490200	Scott, what would you have my name be?
492200	494200	I mean, literally anything else.
494200	496200	All right, I'll be literally anything else.
496200	499200	He's now Link from Zelda.
503200	509200	When we go back and listen to this, every time Elden Ring is said, it's just Scott introducing himself.
509200	512200	It's like, yeah, I'm Scott Dorward.
514200	518200	Every time Elden Ring is said, it's replaced with, it's a me.
518200	519200	It's a me.
519200	522200	Or you could just call me Kief, since that's like...
522200	528200	Yeah, we can spoil maybe at this point that your character is inspired by Kief from The Righteous Gemstones.
528200	535200	If you have been hitting some character moments with that in mind that have made Joe and I almost wet our pants.
535200	537200	It's been a really fun experience.
537200	541200	I'm happy to have such a delightful cult leader to be playing alongside,
541200	550200	as well as a crew of two that no one should outdo the brewer and whichever name you're going by.
551200	552200	Dave Ellington!
552200	554200	Dave Ellington, isn't that a pretty good fake name?
554200	555200	It's fucking great.
555200	558200	David Ellington, or is he just Birth Dave?
558200	561200	Oh yeah, I am going by David Ellington.
561200	564200	Yeah, it's very familiar for you two to call me Dave.
566200	574200	But where we really ended off is that Elden Ring here reached into the depths of part of your mind,
574200	577200	specifically Margaret Payne, the philanthropist,
577200	585200	reached into her mind and was met once again with a voice that basically enlisted Elden Ring
585200	590200	to make sure that the partygoers know that nothing should go off without a hitch this evening,
590200	594200	that Mardant's new invention should be well received,
594200	600200	and that everyone should know it's going to change the world, you know.
600200	610200	And so, then he comes to and sees the fucking religion man with black eyes.
610200	612200	Did you forget the word reverent?
615200	616200	Yeah.
616200	618200	The fucking religion man.
620200	622200	But yeah, then you looked at Checkers and said,
622200	626200	Are you excited for Mardant's new invention? It's going to change the world, you know.
626200	628200	See, isn't that a great Keef, everybody?
628200	631200	Doing Keef from the Righteous Gemstones.
633200	637200	When he says that to Checkers, immediately he's-
637200	639200	Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack!
639200	641200	Are you really attacking him?
641200	642200	Okay.
642200	644200	Isn't that how I would put it in your head?
644200	647200	Yeah, it kinda is. You know what? You said you wouldn't.
647200	648200	I did say that.
648200	651200	And you meant it, but now you have no choice.
651200	652200	I really don't.
652200	655200	Okay, so is it a power contest?
655200	656200	Scott, is this cool?
656200	661200	If you're both happy with this, I am absolutely ecstatic.
661200	662200	I'm fine with it, yeah.
665200	666200	Oh shit.
666200	670200	I succeeded with a 38 on a 90, and I got a 31.
670200	674200	And what is Checkers' power?
674200	675200	90 as well.
675200	678200	Oh god, so you're both tied.
678200	680200	We're in a minelock!
681200	684200	Yeah, I mean, normally it goes to the person with the higher power,
684200	687200	but you've both got the same power.
687200	693200	So I'm happy, I think, to treat this as a stalemate, so yes.
693200	697200	Checkers can feel, yeah, for some reason,
697200	700200	Eldin has turned against you, it seems.
700200	703200	He is trying to implant these thoughts in your head.
703200	707200	But at the same time, he has at least implanted some of them
707200	713200	so that perhaps you can feel that he really wants you to go out there
713200	719200	and convince everyone else at the party that Mordin's adventure
719200	721200	is going to change the world, you know?
721200	724200	Yeah, so I can feel that he's done this to me.
724200	726200	Eldin Ring starts crying.
726200	727200	Eldin!
730200	732200	Eldin, what is the invention?
733200	736200	It's going to change the world, you know?
736200	739200	Checkers starts backing up a little bit,
739200	741200	and he wants to get the fuck out of this room.
741200	744200	He doesn't want to be around psychic attacks.
744200	745200	Checkers!
745200	747200	Yeah, Checkers runs out the front.
747200	749200	It's going to change the world, you know?
749200	752200	He runs out the front into the snow.
752200	755200	How far away is the tower from me right now?
755200	757200	A couple of minutes walk.
757200	759200	Yeah, you can see the outline of it.
759200	765200	It's quite dark out here now, and there is really quite heavy snow.
765200	769200	If you're looking around just trying to get your bearings there in the snow,
769200	771200	you can give me a spot to hit and roll.
773200	774200	There you are.
774200	777200	No, I mean, you can remember roughly where you came from,
777200	780200	but you can't even make out the outline of the tower now.
780200	785200	There's a few feet of snow, it seems, that have fallen since you've been in there.
785200	790200	The cars are partly buried under the snow now,
790200	794200	and you can't even see any footprints out here now.
794200	795200	It's all been covered up.
795200	799200	Yeah, since I didn't grab my coat or anything, I'm cold already,
799200	803200	and Checkers is thinking, I just need to get inside,
803200	807200	but not around all the crazy people that are in there.
807200	811200	He remembers when he got poked in the eye by his pencil
811200	814200	that they were passing a tower,
814200	818200	so he wants to go in the direction that he thinks the tower is.
818200	823200	Well, seeing as you're doing this blind, let's have a luck roll.
825200	827200	Pass. 17.
827200	828200	Fuck yeah.
828200	831200	So, yeah, even though you can't see the tower,
831200	836200	you make your way through the whipping snow,
836200	843200	and you do eventually find yourself at the base of this structure.
843200	846200	You can make out the general shape of it now that you're underneath it,
846200	850200	but the visibility has dropped almost nothing now.
850200	855200	He reaches out to the rungs of the ladder,
855200	858200	and he's like, oh, I think there might be ice on this,
858200	861200	so he gives it a little lick, and yeah, sure enough.
861200	863200	It tastes cold.
863200	866200	Sure enough, it tastes like cold, and there is ice on it,
866200	870200	but he's going to try to carefully make his way up
870200	872200	because he's freezing cold right now,
872200	874200	so he just wants to get inside somewhere.
874200	876200	Yeah, you make your way out.
876200	878200	It is not a pleasant climb.
878200	882200	Every rung is now more and more slippery as you're going up,
882200	886200	and the wind is pulling at your clothing a couple of times.
886200	890200	You're really having to hold on tight to stop yourself being blown off,
890200	894200	but somehow you do make it up to this trapdoor,
894200	897200	and from the other side of the trapdoor,
897200	900200	you can hear the sound of things being smashed.
900200	906200	Yeah, intense clanging and genteel screams
906200	909200	and the grunts of a brute.
909200	913200	Yeah, that terrifies Checkers,
913200	918200	but he's freezing cold, and the only option is climbing back down this,
918200	920200	and he's not going to do that, so he...
920200	925200	I think you might recognize this Lafayette in the screens.
925200	928200	As I'm trying to decide whether I climb back down
928200	932200	to get away from this scary sound, I hear him say something.
932200	934200	I'm like, oh, I think that's the scientist,
934200	936200	and I pop in.
936200	941200	We comically stop in mid-motion of our smashing and see him standing there.
943200	945200	Oh, Checkers.
945200	947200	Fellas?
947200	949200	Enjoying the party?
949200	952200	Harvey, have you thought any more about that pamphlet I gave you?
954200	956200	I haven't got a chance to read it yet.
956200	957200	We're kind of busy here.
957200	958200	You can read, though, right?
958200	959200	Of course.
959200	960200	Okay, great.
960200	963200	Checkers, be a lad and grab something blunt and heavy
963200	965200	and start smashing all of this, would you?
965200	967200	I'm going to look around.
967200	970200	That's a fail on my spot hidden, so I'm going to grab...
970200	972200	What's something shitty that would be up here?
972200	974200	Just kick something, Checkers.
974200	976200	I don't know, just smash, smash, Checkers, smash.
976200	979200	I start using my fists and feet to...
979200	983200	I'm not really sure what I'm doing, but there's a big guy.
983200	986200	There's these two guys and a really big one telling me to do this.
986200	987200	I'm just going to do it.
987200	995200	Did you see two guys in tuxedos just kicking weird science machinery?
995200	998200	This is what the liberal elite do at parties.
998200	1004200	Yeah, I'm going to start smashing stuff, but also there's a lot of cool gadget-looking shit here,
1004200	1008200	so I'm going to start flipping switches while I'm punching buttons and stuff.
1008200	1013200	Okay, yeah, flipping switches doesn't really do much at the moment because...
1013200	1014200	Yeah, there's no power.
1014200	1016200	Yeah, we smashed it up good.
1018200	1021200	Did anything happen when we smashed the big bulb?
1021200	1022200	It broke.
1022200	1023200	Nice!
1023200	1025200	Cool, I bet that was loud.
1026200	1027200	I bet it was like...
1030200	1033200	Checkers is starting to really get into it.
1033200	1037200	He hasn't really had an outlet for his frustration in a while,
1037200	1041200	so in his coked-up brain, he's like, yeah, fuck this place,
1041200	1043200	and he pulls out a lighter.
1044200	1046200	He's going to try to just set something on fire.
1046200	1048200	Oh, that's the spirit, boyo.
1049200	1051200	Can you give me a luck roll, please?
1051200	1055200	Scott did say earlier that the flaming tower could fall and you guys could all live.
1055200	1057200	Yeah, 25 on a 32.
1057200	1061200	So you two managed to start a couple of small fires,
1061200	1064200	but at the moment, they haven't gone completely out of control.
1065200	1066200	Perfect.
1068200	1071200	You set an attainable goal and you achieved that goal.
1071200	1076200	Yeah, as I continue kicking the stuff in here and I look at Harvey,
1076200	1079200	I'm like, look, and just point at one of the fires.
1079200	1082200	Harvey looks over and is surprised how into it you've gotten,
1082200	1084200	but then notices the fire.
1084200	1086200	Whoa, buddy, maybe too much there.
1086200	1089200	We're still up here. If this thing goes up, we gotta go down.
1089200	1091200	Yeah, fuck this place.
1092200	1094200	The fire is slowly spreading.
1094200	1097200	It's caught onto some of the insulation of the wiring
1097200	1103200	and there's a bit of thick black smoke that is now pooling into the air,
1103200	1106200	but it's not out of control yet.
1106200	1109200	Lafayette, he sees that. He's taking a break.
1109200	1114200	He's taking a heavy breather, and he thinks it's hilarious that...
1116200	1118200	I keep wanting to call you Chuckles.
1119200	1121200	You surely can.
1121200	1124200	Chuckles, I think it's hilarious what you've done in this tower,
1124200	1128200	but I do think we should probably get a move on pretty quickly now.
1128200	1130200	He takes a moment to look around,
1130200	1135200	and he wants to steal the most advanced thing, intact thing he can,
1135200	1138200	like an antenna, maybe the most alien-looking deal.
1138200	1142200	He's like, fuck you, Cicero, I'll burn your tower down
1142200	1145200	and I'm going to reverse-engineer your technology.
1145200	1150200	The really alien-looking antennae are actually on the outside of the tower.
1150200	1152200	I mean, you've smashed the place up.
1152200	1156200	You could open up a window and lean out and try to unscrew one of them,
1156200	1162200	but the wind is really high at the moment, so this is not without risk.
1165200	1166200	Harvey?
1169200	1173200	Hey, boy, Harvey, would you please lean out the window there
1173200	1176200	and grab me one of those antennae before this place burns to the ground?
1176200	1179200	Harvey's just going to do a smash with a fist through a window
1179200	1183200	and try and reach out and grab ahold of the nearest antennae
1183200	1185200	and just yank as hard as he can.
1185200	1190200	I'd say give me a combined strength and luck roll
1190200	1194200	to see whether you can do this without destroying the antenna
1194200	1198200	and without cutting your arms to shreds on the broken window.
1200200	1204200	I rolled a 71. My strength is 90, but my luck is only 65.
1204200	1207200	Okay, so that is a failure.
1207200	1211200	So I think what that means is, yes, you've punched through the window.
1211200	1214200	You've managed to wrench this antennae away.
1214200	1217200	I mean, you've got bits of it in your hand,
1217200	1220200	but you have cut your arm in the process.
1220200	1224200	I'll say that you take only one hit point of damage from this,
1224200	1228200	but there is blood that is now running down your hand,
1228200	1230200	or at least running down your arm,
1230200	1233200	and your hand's getting a bit sticky and slick from it.
1233200	1237200	It might occur to you that this is perhaps suboptimal
1237200	1240200	for your climb down again.
1240200	1243200	Can I attempt a first aid roll on him real quick?
1243200	1245200	I mean, you can try.
1245200	1247200	It'll take you a bit of time to bind the wound,
1247200	1250200	and that fire is beginning to spray.
1250200	1253200	If you want to take the time out in the burning building
1253200	1256200	to bind the wound up, you certainly can.
1256200	1259200	At the very least, it'll be entertaining.
1259200	1263200	When Checkers sees this happening and sees him cut,
1263200	1268200	with his 1% in medicine, he holds his lighter up.
1268200	1270200	Got to cauterize it.
1272200	1276200	No, why don't you hold off on the cauterization?
1276200	1279200	Lafayette is looking at the briefcase
1279200	1282200	that's never left his hand this whole time,
1282200	1285200	and he's looking at the flames, and he's like,
1285200	1289200	I think we should probably move it pretty quick.
1289200	1293200	He runs down the ladder without further consideration.
1293200	1295200	Oh, you're such a tease!
1295200	1297200	Well, seeing as you're doing this in a hurry now,
1297200	1300200	fleeing the burning cabin,
1300200	1302200	you're perhaps not getting the opportunity
1302200	1305200	to be quite as cautious as you were on the way up,
1305200	1308200	so I think this is where I start asking for rolls.
1308200	1309200	Okay.
1309200	1312200	I'll give you a choice as to whether to make a dex
1312200	1314200	or a climb roll, whichever is better,
1314200	1316200	but what I will say is that,
1316200	1319200	as Lafayette is carrying his suitcase,
1319200	1322200	I'm going to ask for a hard dig.
1322200	1326200	Well, my dex is 30, and I rolled a 36.
1326200	1329200	So you missed by 21 here.
1329200	1331200	You've got a number of rungs down,
1331200	1335200	but now that you're trying to get down fast,
1335200	1337200	these rungs are really quite slick,
1337200	1341200	and you realize that you're not going to be able to get down
1341200	1347200	before the flames start spreading to the actual structure
1347200	1349200	if you're carrying the suitcase.
1349200	1350200	Oh!
1350200	1353200	Well, then my only option is to open it,
1353200	1356200	strap on the jet pack inside.
1356200	1359200	Yes!
1359200	1362200	Bow, bow, bow, bow.
1362200	1365200	And rocket man away from the fucking conflagration.
1365200	1367200	Rocket man!
1368200	1371200	So you are trying to, while in, you know,
1371200	1373200	50 or 60 mile per hour winds,
1373200	1377200	on this icy ladder under a burning building,
1377200	1379200	you're trying to strap on a jet pack.
1379200	1383200	Well, when you put it like that, Scott.
1383200	1386200	Sounds simple, easy, and yeah, that's what he does.
1386200	1390200	His design is as ergonomic as it is brilliant.
1390200	1391200	Okay.
1391200	1395200	In which case, I think just for slipping this on in a big hurry,
1395200	1397200	let's just make this an ordinary Dex roll.
1397200	1398200	Okay.
1398200	1400200	Oh, you better fucking make it 26.
1400200	1401200	Yes!
1401200	1403200	On a 30.
1403200	1404200	Okay.
1404200	1407200	So yes, you can strap that on.
1407200	1408200	And what is your plan?
1408200	1410200	Are you just leaping into the wind from there,
1410200	1413200	or are you trying to just slow your descent?
1413200	1414200	What are you doing?
1414200	1417200	He licks a finger and holds it out and gauges, like,
1417200	1421200	before it gets, like, whipped away by the 50 mile an hour wind.
1421200	1423200	He says, it is cold.
1424200	1427200	Your finger tastes cold.
1429200	1433200	He gauges the direction of the wind and leaps off with it
1433200	1438200	and ignites the jet pack and tries to, you know,
1438200	1440200	he doesn't want to fight the storm.
1440200	1443200	He wants to rise with it into the air.
1443200	1445200	Riders on the storm.
1445200	1451200	So you are completely at the mercy of this jet pack.
1451200	1454200	So I think we'll come back to you in a moment.
1454200	1455200	Okay, perfect.
1455200	1457200	Fuck, yes, dude.
1457200	1460200	That was amazing.
1460200	1462200	But let's deal with the other two first.
1462200	1464200	So you're in this burning structure,
1464200	1469200	and you've just seen Lafayette down below you on the ladder
1469200	1472200	strap something onto his back and then just jump off the ladder.
1472200	1474200	Yeah, Lafayette is like, we gotta get out of here.
1474200	1475200	Deuces.
1475200	1478200	Can I assume that it's on fire enough that, like,
1478200	1479200	it's a pretty well lit...
1479200	1480200	It's well lit.
1480200	1482200	I'm well lit, bro.
1482200	1483200	Yeah, yeah.
1483200	1485200	I think the darkness is the least of your problems.
1485200	1490200	Yeah, so I see that happen, and I look around the room,
1490200	1494200	and I look at Harvey before we can even have the conversation
1494200	1495200	about who goes first.
1495200	1496200	I'm going down.
1496200	1499200	Harvey is standing there a bit odd watching the rocket pack
1499200	1502200	light up and start to take off, and he's,
1502200	1504200	the madman did it.
1504200	1505200	The madman did it.
1505200	1506200	It's working.
1506200	1507200	It's working.
1507200	1509200	Goodbye, Harvey.
1511200	1515200	As he watches wherever that starts to take him,
1515200	1518200	Harvey's going to start trying to get down the ladder also.
1518200	1520200	Yeah, as soon as I go down, I...
1520200	1522200	Get your ass down here.
1522200	1524200	We need you in the group.
1524200	1525200	Yeah.
1525200	1527200	Like, I can't lose a cult member.
1527200	1528200	Yeah.
1531200	1533200	So I think checkers, first of all,
1533200	1535200	let's have a dex roll from checkers to see how well you're
1535200	1537200	clambering down the ladder.
1537200	1539200	That's a 36 on a 50.
1539200	1541200	OK, so you're going down fine.
1541200	1545200	I mean, it's slow going because, again, you're having to,
1545200	1547200	every now and then, just hug onto the ladder for dear life
1547200	1549200	to stop being blown off.
1549200	1553200	But you are getting down without falling off, which is good.
1553200	1556200	On the other hand, Harvey and his wounded arm now,
1556200	1559200	I'm going to ask for a hard dex roll because of the injury.
1562200	1563200	It's a fail fail.
1563200	1564200	62 on a 50.
1564200	1567200	You're making your way down, but at the moment,
1567200	1571200	the blood's dripping down off your arm and your hand's slick.
1571200	1573200	Every now and then, because of the blood in your hand,
1573200	1574200	it's actually freezing.
1574200	1577200	I was going to say, I'm getting stuck to it every now and then.
1578200	1580200	And when you're pulling us away, you can feel skin coming
1580200	1583200	away as you're getting your hand free.
1584200	1585200	Who's hungry?
1587200	1591200	He's going to try and rip off his sleeve of that arm and try
1591200	1594200	and pull it down further so that he's not having the blood
1594200	1596200	contact with the rail.
1596200	1598200	I'll tell you what, let's be generous here.
1598200	1601200	Let's treat this as a push roll so there will be really bad
1601200	1603200	consequences if you fail.
1603200	1605200	But I'll say it because you're doing that.
1605200	1608200	This sounds more like brute strength than dexterity.
1608200	1609200	If you want to make a strength roll.
1609200	1611200	Yeah, I would like to do that.
1612200	1613200	You got this.
1614200	1618200	It's a 64 on a 90, so I pass, but not a hard pass.
1619200	1621200	No, this just needed to be a hard.
1621200	1624200	So yes, you do manage to tug it down.
1624200	1628200	I mean, that's not quite stopped the bleeding, but it
1628200	1631200	slowed it down enough that the blood isn't going to be quite
1631200	1633200	as much of an impediment.
1633200	1637200	So yeah, with that, you can clamp your way carefully and
1637200	1639200	painfully down to the ground.
1639200	1641200	Do I lose any hit points in the process?
1641200	1642200	Is it that kind of damage?
1642200	1644200	No, you lost the one before for slashing your arm up,
1644200	1645200	but that's it.
1645200	1648200	But the rest of it, I mean, it's largely cosmetic damage.
1648200	1651200	Your hand hurts a bit from endorsing a bit of the skin off
1651200	1656200	your palm and your fingertips, but yeah, that's just uncomfortable.
1656200	1659200	Oh, you got a bright future ahead of you though.
1660200	1661200	No fingertips.
1662200	1663200	You could do some stuff.
1665200	1666200	Crime.
1666200	1667200	Crime for sure.
1667200	1671200	Also in 1937, do they have that kind of forensics?
1671200	1672200	Google it.
1672200	1673200	Oh yeah.
1673200	1674200	Google it.
1674200	1679200	Yeah, fingerprint technology came in about 1900 and even
1679200	1683200	from the 1930s, they could do latent fingerprints off fabrics
1683200	1684200	and stuff like that.
1684200	1686200	I'm just saying this because I researched it for a different project.
1686200	1687200	No, that's awesome.
1687200	1688200	No, that's really cool.
1689200	1691200	It's nice to have someone knowledgeable on the podcast.
1691200	1695200	I guarantee I've Googled this before and then learned it and
1695200	1697200	then immediately forgot the information.
1697200	1699200	So that's not learning, is it?
1699200	1702200	I'll forget in a week's time, but I was just recording something
1702200	1705200	else two days back that required that knowledge, so nice.
1705200	1712200	So let's cut back to the inside of the manor where Mr.
1712200	1717200	Ring had been given a new mission in life.
1717200	1719200	It's going to change the world, you know?
1719200	1722200	While you're wandering around the crowd and I mean,
1722200	1724200	most of the people that you're telling that to are telling
1724200	1725200	the same G5 back.
1725200	1727200	He's stuck in the loop of the three guys.
1729200	1732200	Yeah, when we cut back, I'm the fourth in the acapella group.
1733200	1737200	It's going to change the world, you know?
1737200	1742200	It's going to change the world, you know?
1742200	1748200	It's going to change the world, you know?
1748200	1749200	Wait, I'm sorry.
1749200	1750200	Can we actually try this?
1750200	1751200	This is bullshit.
1751200	1753200	When he and my baby see more dense inventions.
1753200	1754200	This is dumb.
1754200	1755200	We can do this.
1755200	1756200	Yeah, we can do it.
1756200	1757200	No, we can't.
1757200	1759200	It's going to change the world.
1759200	1762200	It's going to change the world.
1762200	1764200	It's going to change the world.
1764200	1774200	It's going to change the world, you know?
1774200	1777200	Bubble, bubble down.
1777200	1779200	Well, you have your new theme song.
1779200	1781200	OK, that was good.
1781200	1784200	I just love to think that the swing band up on stage
1784200	1787200	is so taken with your number that they're actually joining in.
1787200	1788200	Yes.
1788200	1795200	They're waving us up.
1795200	1796200	God.
1796200	1798200	So are there people that I see who are not
1798200	1800200	under the same thrall that I'm under?
1800200	1802200	I mean, it's difficult to tell.
1802200	1805200	I mean, you're sort of sounding people out.
1805200	1806200	Totally.
1806200	1808200	It's through your call and response method.
1808200	1814200	But while you're doing this, Margaret Payne grabs your arm.
1814200	1815200	Money.
1815200	1817200	Oh, hi.
1817200	1818200	I'm sorry.
1818200	1820200	I don't know who else to ask,
1820200	1824200	but I'm getting more and more worried about Cicero.
1824200	1826200	How's he going to be able to change the world
1826200	1828200	with his invention?
1828200	1829200	And it is going to change the world, you know.
1829200	1830200	Oh, of course.
1830200	1831200	It's going to change the world, you know.
1831200	1833200	But how's he going to be able to change the world
1833200	1837200	with his invention if he isn't actually here?
1837200	1838200	Where is he?
1838200	1839200	I'm getting worried.
1839200	1841200	I mean, what, two hours into the party now?
1841200	1844200	He puts his hands on either side of her shoulders
1844200	1846200	and says, we must go find him.
1846200	1847200	We must.
1847200	1848200	We must.
1848200	1849200	We must.
1849200	1850200	Let's.
1850200	1852200	And she grabs you by the hand
1852200	1854200	and leads you out to the ballroom.
1854200	1855200	Perfect.
1855200	1856200	Quick question.
1856200	1857200	Like the people in the house,
1857200	1860200	are there like windows that they would be seeing,
1860200	1863200	like the fire?
1863200	1864200	Yeah.
1864200	1869200	And I mean, maybe, maybe if they weren't,
1869200	1871200	you know, so distracted by the party
1871200	1875200	and if it weren't so difficult to see it through
1875200	1879200	the really thick snowstorm that's going on outside,
1879200	1880200	they might've noticed.
1880200	1882200	But as it is at the moment, no.
1882200	1884200	As she's whisking him away, he's like,
1884200	1886200	I just lost my best friend, you know,
1886200	1889200	so it's nice to have someone new so quickly.
1889200	1892200	Oh, you poor thing, she says.
1892200	1894200	Puts a protective arm around your shoulder.
1894200	1896200	He nuzzles.
1896200	1899200	Unbeknownst to Elden Ring,
1900200	1902200	as Checkers is going down the ladder,
1902200	1905200	he's thinking, we could pivot, we could pivot.
1909200	1911200	You're thinking jet packs now.
1911200	1912200	No, he's thinking, he's like,
1912200	1915200	the cult can just be whatever his invention is.
1915200	1916200	Oh, nice.
1916200	1917200	Like, I don't care.
1917200	1919200	I don't believe in the bullshit I'm peddling.
1919200	1921200	Because today's going to change the world, you know.
1921200	1922200	Yeah, exactly.
1922200	1924200	Oh shit, he got Scott.
1925200	1930200	So, she says, I've had a look around downstairs,
1930200	1933200	and I haven't managed to find him yet.
1933200	1936200	I was going to check upstairs,
1936200	1943200	but I just, I wanted some company because, well.
1943200	1946200	I fear nothing in the physical realm.
1946200	1951200	Good, because, this is going to sound very strange,
1951200	1955200	but I saw one of the maids upstairs,
1955200	1958200	just in the glooms, I was heading upstairs,
1958200	1961200	and there was something very wrong with her.
1961200	1963200	Wrong how?
1963200	1966200	The way she was walking, she was hunched over,
1966200	1970200	and, oh, this is going to sound mad.
1970200	1972200	You can tell me, Margaret Payne.
1972200	1974200	It looked like she had too many legs.
1974200	1976200	I'm sorry, what did you just say, Margaret Payne?
1976200	1977200	She had too many legs.
1977200	1980200	She had two legs?
1980200	1981200	That's completely normal.
1981200	1982200	Too many legs.
1982200	1985200	Oh, too many, that is.
1985200	1988200	Oh, how, oh.
1988200	1989200	Yeah, that's a spooky name.
1989200	1992200	And he starts picturing a maid with multiple legs.
1992200	1996200	I think you triggered something in me.
1996200	2001200	Yeah, there's a lot of that online.
2001200	2004200	I'm thinking like the lusty Argonian maid.
2004200	2007200	I don't know what that is.
2007200	2010200	Do you have a book in Skyrim?
2010200	2012200	Okay, well, that's okay.
2012200	2015200	Sometimes we see things that don't look right,
2015200	2017200	and our brain rationalizes them
2017200	2020200	so that we can understand the physical realm
2020200	2022200	as it is in the spiritual.
2022200	2023200	You'll be okay.
2023200	2028200	Yes, of course, as you say, as you say.
2028200	2031200	And if this leggy maid gets anywhere near us,
2031200	2036200	I'll call into her brain to ward her away.
2036200	2038200	Yes, you do that, she says,
2038200	2043200	and pats you on the back of the hand.
2043200	2046200	And he kind of like, he does the thing where his fingers,
2046200	2048200	where he's got two fingers up on either hand,
2048200	2052200	and he's like putting them to his temples.
2052200	2057200	And he's going like, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo.
2057200	2060200	Yeah, the two of you head up the stairs,
2060200	2065200	Margaret taking the lead, and the hallway up above,
2065200	2067200	I mean, there's a landing, first of all,
2067200	2070200	but there's a hallway that runs along for the landing
2070200	2072200	that goes down the main wing of the house.
2072200	2073200	Be careful, Margaret Payne.
2073200	2076200	I will go ahead and make sure the coast is clear.
2076200	2079200	Yes, yes, I'll be right behind you.
2079200	2081200	You can hold on to my shirt.
2081200	2087200	That's very generous of you, she says.
2087200	2089200	And he'll continue down the hall,
2089200	2091200	slow enough so that she doesn't fall behind,
2091200	2093200	you know, with the shirt holding.
2093200	2098200	It's the 30s, so people have fewer but nicer shirts.
2098200	2101200	So it is.
2101200	2104200	So you see, down the end of the corridor,
2104200	2107200	there's a set of double doors that look like they're
2107200	2110200	probably to the master bedroom,
2110200	2113200	and one of them is slightly ajar,
2113200	2116200	and you can see there's some light coming out of that.
2116200	2119200	You could give me a listen roll as well, if you want.
2119200	2120200	I'd love that.
2120200	2123200	I rolled a 73 over 50,
2123200	2127200	and I would not like to spend the luck,
2127200	2132200	but I would like to get on my hands and knees
2132200	2136200	and crawl at a brisk pace to try to get closer,
2136200	2138200	undetected, to listen better.
2138200	2142200	Okay, yeah, if you want to push the roll.
2142200	2144200	I would like to do that.
2144200	2146200	I think there's a good chance you might get caught
2146200	2149200	in the act then, because that looks a bit suspicious.
2150200	2153200	Oh, 25 on a 50. Hard success.
2153200	2154200	Okay.
2154200	2155200	Nice.
2155200	2158200	Then, yeah, you get down on your hands and knees,
2158200	2162200	and Margaret looks a bit confused by this
2162200	2165200	and then gets down on her hands and knees as well.
2165200	2169200	You form your little quadrupedal conga line down the corridor.
2171200	2174200	As you're passing by one of the doors,
2174200	2177200	you can hear what sounds like howling wind
2177200	2179200	from the other side of the door.
2179200	2182200	I mean, you've obviously heard some of the windows rattling
2182200	2185200	and there's the sound of wind outside,
2185200	2189200	but it sounds like maybe there's a window open in this room
2189200	2193200	and the wind's got in, the door itself is shaking.
2193200	2197200	Margaret Payne, the window in this room is open.
2197200	2199200	Well, that's unfortunate.
2199200	2201200	Shall we peek in together,
2201200	2203200	or would you like to continue to stay behind me?
2204200	2206200	I suppose we could.
2206200	2209200	I mean, that's Cicero's room up ahead, she says.
2211200	2213200	Do you think it's important that the window's open?
2213200	2215200	I don't know, Scott, is it?
2220200	2221200	Fucking DMs, man.
2224200	2226200	I turn back and I say,
2226200	2228200	well, he might not be in his room,
2228200	2230200	and if the window is open here,
2230200	2232200	it might lead us to learn more,
2232200	2235200	to be able to help him or find him,
2235200	2237200	so I think we should open up the door.
2237200	2240200	I think the brain of the house is behind the double doors.
2241200	2244200	And it's the bug brain from Starship Troopers,
2244200	2246200	and Neil Patrick Harris touches it and says,
2246200	2247200	it's afraid.
2247200	2249200	I'm doing my part.
2250200	2252200	That's also from that movie.
2252200	2253200	I haven't seen it.
2253200	2255200	So yeah, we're going to creep into the door.
2255200	2256200	I know, I haven't seen it.
2256200	2257200	Oh, you're going to love it.
2257200	2258200	You're going to creep into the room
2258200	2259200	while you heard the wind.
2259200	2261200	Yeah, still on hands and knees.
2261200	2262200	Nice.
2262200	2264200	Okay, so yeah, you open up the door
2264200	2266200	and there is a bit of resistance.
2266200	2269200	And yeah, as you push it open,
2269200	2271200	you realize, yeah, it is because there's wind
2271200	2272200	blowing in from outside.
2272200	2274200	There's also snow on the ground.
2275200	2278200	With the window open, snow has been coming in,
2278200	2279200	and there's a fair bit of it.
2279200	2282200	This looks like it's probably a guest bedroom.
2282200	2284200	It's made up as such.
2284200	2285200	I mean, it's certainly a bedroom
2285200	2287200	and there are sheets on the bed.
2287200	2289200	Everything's dark, however,
2289200	2292200	and you can only make out vague shapes of furniture
2292200	2294200	and the snow on the ground.
2294200	2296200	Don't worry about me, Margaret Payne.
2296200	2298200	My warmth is on the inside.
2300200	2302200	Good, she says.
2305200	2307200	It doesn't seem like anyone is in here,
2307200	2309200	so he's just going to kind of get up and pop around.
2309200	2311200	It's difficult to tell because it is dark.
2311200	2312200	Gotcha.
2312200	2314200	So he's going to whisper into the darkness,
2314200	2316200	is anyone cold?
2317200	2319200	And Margaret from behind, he says,
2319200	2321200	I'm a bit chilly.
2323200	2325200	Okay, forget my ignorance,
2325200	2330200	but in 1937, would you be able to just turn the lights on?
2330200	2331200	Yes.
2331200	2335200	Okay, that helps me going into more of this.
2337200	2341200	If no one responds to my query other than Margaret Payne,
2341200	2343200	Elden Ring stands up.
2343200	2346200	All right, well, if anyone is cold in here
2346200	2348200	and needs help, maybe closing the windows,
2348200	2351200	that would be good, but if not, I mean, Cicero,
2351200	2354200	if you're, okay, we're just going to,
2354200	2356200	bye, bye, I'm talking to no one.
2356200	2358200	He's, Margaret Payne, I'm speaking to no one,
2358200	2361200	and he heads back out into the hallway.
2361200	2362200	I mean, the only thing is,
2362200	2363200	you could give me a spot hidden role
2363200	2365200	to see whether you notice anything in the gloom.
2365200	2368200	Fail, 37 on a 25.
2368200	2371200	Cicero successfully hides in the corner.
2372200	2376200	I will use my 12 luck to make that a success.
2379200	2381200	As your eyes adjust to the gloom,
2381200	2384200	you can see that over by the window,
2384200	2388200	one of the things that you thought was snow
2388200	2392200	that had blown in, a mound of snow on the ground.
2392200	2394200	It's the cocaine that I've been looking for.
2394200	2399200	That's, yeah, that's not snow.
2399200	2403200	That is someone lying there very still.
2403200	2406200	Oh, whoops, I did not see you.
2406200	2408200	Are you cold?
2408200	2410200	You've got like a Mitch Hedberg.
2412200	2414200	I did not see you.
2414200	2417200	I am so sorry, I did not see you.
2417200	2420200	They don't move or they don't react.
2420200	2422200	Huh, all right.
2422200	2424200	Escalators cannot be broken.
2427200	2430200	And he's gonna, he's just gonna stare.
2430200	2431200	Temporarily?
2431200	2434200	At the body for a little bit.
2434200	2436200	Temporarily.
2438200	2441200	Sorry for the convenience, podcast listeners.
2441200	2444200	Margaret Payne, I'm going to approach this body.
2444200	2447200	Do you know anything about the first aid skills?
2447200	2449200	Not really.
2449200	2451200	Well, maybe if you didn't spend all of your money
2451200	2454200	paying other people to be good at helping others,
2454200	2457200	then you would know how to help someone yourself.
2457200	2461200	And he moves on to the body.
2461200	2464200	Very judgmental, she says.
2464200	2467200	You cut her pretty deep on that one.
2467200	2470200	Scott, weren't you the one talking about her lazy eye?
2472200	2475200	He's judgmental now.
2475200	2477200	That's a physical description.
2477200	2480200	He didn't apply any emotions to the eye.
2481200	2483200	Yeah, but he dragged her ass.
2485200	2488200	Thanks for coming back on the podcast, Scott.
2488200	2491200	Yeah, any time, I guess.
2491200	2493200	Any time, I guess.
2498200	2500200	So what's up with this body? I'm gonna poke it.
2500200	2502200	Okay, yeah, you creep forward.
2502200	2506200	In the gloom, you can make out that it does seem to be
2506200	2508200	the body of a young woman.
2508200	2511200	She just seems to be in her undergarments
2511200	2514200	lying there in the snow,
2514200	2517200	and you can see that there's blood
2517200	2519200	soaked into the snow around her head.
2519200	2521200	You should look her to see if she's cold.
2521200	2524200	I think that she's just crying.
2525200	2527200	Oh, my God.
2528200	2530200	This dead girl tastes cold.
2530200	2533200	To solve this mystery, I'm gonna need two things.
2533200	2536200	A hammer and a whole army.
2537200	2541200	So I'm not gonna lick the body.
2541200	2546200	I'm going to grab some cloth drapes
2546200	2550200	if I see anything around to just throw over the body immediately.
2550200	2553200	Yeah, I mean, there's bed linens
2553200	2556200	that you can easily grab and throw on her.
2556200	2558200	Margaret Payne, could you please close the window
2558200	2561200	while I connect with this lady intellectually?
2561200	2563200	Is that young woman dead?
2563200	2565200	Yeah, I think so. There's only one way to find out.
2565200	2566200	So I'm gonna...
2566200	2569200	Psychic attack! Psychic attack!
2572200	2575200	You took the words right out of my mouth.
2575200	2578200	Dude, if she's dead, you're gonna kick her ass.
2578200	2581200	I don't know how the psychic attack works,
2581200	2583200	but maybe you'll die.
2583200	2586200	You finally met someone you can beat.
2587200	2589200	God damn it, I thought you were supposed to feel cool
2589200	2592200	in Pulp Cathedral.
2593200	2595200	You're a loser.
2595200	2598200	Your character is the vessel through which this story
2598200	2601200	gets to feel very cool, but yeah,
2601200	2605200	you are whatever dark force is working through this home,
2605200	2607200	absolute bitch.
2607200	2612200	Yep, just gonna psychic attack this probably dead body
2612200	2614200	to see if she's still alive,
2614200	2616200	because I don't know anything about first aid.
2616200	2619200	Yeah, well, actually roll,
2619200	2621200	just in case you rolled a double zero.
2621200	2624200	I did not, I rolled a 42, thankfully.
2624200	2627200	Okay, yeah, she's dead.
2627200	2629200	There's nothing there to probe.
2629200	2631200	You just see a blue error screen.
2633200	2635200	Yeah, 404.
2635200	2636200	Margaret Payne.
2636200	2638200	Margaret Payne, there's nothing for us in this room.
2638200	2640200	But that young woman's dead.
2640200	2642200	Oh my god.
2642200	2644200	Now we really need to find Mordaunt.
2644200	2645200	Yeah, there's a murderer.
2645200	2647200	Maybe Cicero's in danger as well.
2647200	2648200	Oh my goodness.
2648200	2650200	We need to find Mordaunt now more than ever.
2650200	2651200	Let's go.
2651200	2655200	Yes, yes, and she scurries out of the room.
2655200	2659200	Do you think we should alert someone about the dead girl?
2659200	2663200	Only when we found Cicero Mordaunt.
2663200	2665200	That is our first priority.
2665200	2668200	Why was she in her undergarments?
2668200	2672200	Hopefully because she was warm.
2672200	2674200	Well, when you get hypothermia,
2674200	2677200	sometimes they find people have taken their clothes off.
2677200	2679200	Well, Margaret Payne,
2679200	2682200	sometimes when people are dying of hypothermia,
2682200	2684200	like she did in the cold,
2684200	2687200	they have a strange reaction that makes them take off their clothes.
2687200	2688200	It's science.
2688200	2690200	I'm not sure it's real.
2690200	2694200	Does hypothermia make you bleed from head wounds?
2694200	2696200	In rare occasions.
2696200	2699200	Such as this one.
2699200	2705200	If you die of hypothermia and fall and hit your head.
2705200	2708200	Oh, that's clearly what happened.
2708200	2710200	You should just go back to the party.
2710200	2712200	Sherlock Holmes says,
2712200	2716200	whatever isn't true is.
2722200	2726200	So, I think we're on the right path here.
2726200	2729200	Yes, I hope Cicero is alright.
2729200	2733200	His invention is going to change the world, you know.
2733200	2737200	I know, it's going to change the world, you know.
2738200	2742200	And they're just crying as they walk down the hall toward Mordhaupt's bedroom.
2742200	2744200	Holding each other.
2746200	2748200	You want to get on all fours again?
2750200	2752200	We can crawl if you want to.
2752200	2754200	We can leave that old corpse behind.
2754200	2757200	Because if the old corpse isn't necessary to the mission,
2757200	2759200	then it's no friend of mine.
2759200	2767200	Okay, so you crawl your way down the corridor towards Mordhaupt's room.
2767200	2771200	And, yeah, as I said, the door is slightly ajar.
2771200	2773200	You can see inside, obviously, the lights are on,
2773200	2775200	because that's where the lights are coming from.
2775200	2779200	Yeah, I doubt you've seen Mordhaupt's bedroom before,
2779200	2783200	but it's as tastelessly furnished as everything else.
2783200	2786200	It's got garish wallpaper,
2786200	2791200	a big four-poster bed with colorful drapes hanging from it.
2791200	2795200	And one of his inventions was to make the bed, like, rotate.
2797200	2800200	No, he's the first person to hang a mirror above the bed.
2800200	2802200	To do coke off of.
2802200	2804200	The rotisserie bed.
2806200	2809200	But it just fell off because of these shitty dimensions.
2809200	2813200	Well, he hasn't invented the anti-gravity coke mirror machine.
2814200	2816200	No one has.
2816200	2819200	It's a shame. It's our last great frontier.
2820200	2826200	But one thing you can see is over behind the bed, just poking out from it,
2826200	2832200	you can see a pair of men's feet wearing socks,
2832200	2839200	just sticking out as if someone's lying on the ground just behind the bed.
2839200	2842200	Hey, Mr. Mordaunt. Mr. Cicero Mordaunt.
2842200	2844200	Party time's gotta go smooth, right?
2844200	2846200	That's what's most important to religion, man.
2846200	2849200	So let's carry on and talk to you now.
2849200	2853200	You just hear a weak groan from the other side of the bed.
2853200	2855200	Help me.
2855200	2858200	Oh, time for those first aid skills, Margaret.
2860200	2865200	Margaret's on her feet and she scurries around the bed.
2865200	2866200	Are you following her?
2866200	2867200	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2867200	2872200	As you go around, you can see that there is something else unusual in the room as well,
2872200	2878200	in that there's a big sort of freestanding wardrobe up against one wall.
2878200	2882200	And the doors are open, but you can see that there's light coming out of it.
2882200	2889200	And from somewhere apparently deep within it, you can hear what sounds like an electrical buzzing.
2889200	2891200	Wow, what a fascinating wardrobe.
2891200	2894200	Is Mordaunt okay, he says, as he's just staring into the light?
2894200	2902200	As you go around, you can see that Cicero is lying there in this long shag pile carpet.
2902200	2908200	He's wearing a silk dressing gown, garishly patterned.
2908200	2909200	He looks pale.
2909200	2918200	He's sweating profusely and his eyes, they've got deep rings under them and they seem quite sunken.
2918200	2926200	His hair is matted with sweat and they're lying just a couple of feet away from him.
2926200	2934200	You can see that there's a bottle that has got some kind of yellowish liquid in it.
2934200	2939200	And next to it, there's a fairly large hypodermic needle,
2939200	2945200	a glass hypodermic needle that's half full of the same liquid that's just lying on the ground.
2945200	2950200	And you can see his trembling fingers, they're reaching out towards the syringe.
2950200	2952200	Oh, wow. Hi.
2952200	2955200	Help me. Help me.
2955200	2960200	Mr. Cicero Mordaunt, it looks like you pre-gamed a little bit too hard for your party.
2960200	2962200	Need medicine.
2962200	2964200	Oh, yes, of course.
2964200	2967200	And I'll jam that fucker full of whatever's in this syringe.
2968200	2972200	Okay. Yeah. I mean, as you grab it and look for somewhere to inject him,
2972200	2976200	you can see that there are track marks and weeping wounds,
2976200	2980200	infected pus-filled wounds all down both of his arms.
2980200	2982200	Gross. Cauterize it.
2984200	2989200	But, I mean, it probably doesn't take you long to find a vein to stick this in.
2989200	2993200	All right. On the count of three, think about your favorite Bible verse, Mr. Mordaunt.
2993200	2997200	To overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a Bible verse.
3001200	3003200	What's your middle name? What's your favorite color?
3003200	3005200	And then he sticks them.
3005200	3009200	Almost immediately you can see he shudders and convulses a bit.
3009200	3015200	And then there's a deep sigh. Oh, that's much better.
3015200	3018200	Mr. Cicero Mordaunt, you have a lovely home here.
3018200	3020200	Thank you so much for inviting me to your party.
3020200	3023200	Yes, yes, of course, of course.
3023200	3028200	I have no idea who you are, but I can't have you thrown out yet.
3028200	3032200	Well, of course, because I'm here because your invention is going to change the world, you know.
3032200	3033200	It's what?
3033200	3037200	Your invention. It's going to change the world, you know.
3037200	3043200	I suppose it is, yes. I wouldn't have put it quite like that, but yes.
3043200	3044200	What is it, by the way?
3044200	3048200	Well, I'll show you when I unveil it all downstairs.
3048200	3051200	I should have been downstairs a long time ago.
3051200	3053200	Oh, Margaret, Margaret!
3053200	3059200	He pushes himself up, grabbing hold of the side of the bed, and says,
3059200	3065200	Oh, Margaret, it's good to see you. I wish it were under better circumstances.
3065200	3070200	From the open wardrobe, you can hear that buzzing sound again.
3070200	3074200	It sounds like it might be electrical sparking. It might not be.
3074200	3080200	There's something about that sound that you can hear that, yeah, that's not electrical.
3080200	3085200	It sounds maybe like a beehive.
3085200	3096200	Cicero's just shaking. You can see his eyes are looking a bit clearer, though, and he's standing up unsteadily.
3096200	3101200	There's a big vein down his forehead that is just pulsing violently.
3101200	3102200	Should have stuck him there.
3102200	3104200	Yeah, I think I found a better vein.
3106200	3109200	Well, no, I'll let you two talk. You can catch up.
3109200	3116200	Yes, yes. Well, I need to get ready. I need to get my invention ready.
3116200	3121200	But he looks over at Mr. Ring.
3121200	3129200	Friend, you cannot tell anyone of what you've seen here. You do understand that...
3129200	3134200	I promise not to tell anyone if you tell me what was in that syringe that I plunged you full of.
3134200	3142200	It is a special serum I use to enhance my mental faculties. It gives me...
3142200	3144200	Mordaunt's special sauce.
3146200	3150200	Yes, I suppose he could call it that, if you were an idiot.
3154200	3157200	Psychic attack! Psychic attack! Psychic attack!
3160200	3161200	Are you psychic attacking me?
3161200	3163200	Fuck yeah! Fuck this dude!
3165200	3167200	Everything's gotta go off without a hitch.
3167200	3169200	Including Mordaunt himself!
3171200	3174200	In which case, yeah, give me a roll.
3174200	3176200	41 on a 90, hard.
3177200	3179200	Oh yeah, he actually failed.
3179200	3180200	Fuck you!
3181200	3190200	So, I mean, you get that sort of simultaneous feeling of looking at him, but also looking inside him, and you're reaching deep inside him.
3190200	3198200	And yeah, there's none of this kind of protection or darkness or anything that you've seen in other people there.
3198200	3204200	I mean, this is just an unprotected human psyche for you to do with as you will.
3204200	3215200	He really digs his claws into this mind space and just tries to plant exactly what the religion man planted in his mind.
3215200	3218200	He's just trying to be a vessel to pass on.
3218200	3223200	He's not even trying to do it himself, he's trying to open up himself to Margaret.
3223200	3232200	He's gonna use Margaret as a conduit to get to the thing on the other side so that it can push through him into Mordaunt.
3232200	3238200	Oh, okay. Well, I mean, you're trying to do this, you're trying to make the connection to Margaret.
3238200	3245200	But Margaret, the conscious part of your mind, you can hear that she actually sounds quite alarmed and frightened.
3245200	3247200	I mean, you can hear her going,
3247200	3252200	Cicero, are you alright? You're frightening me, Cicero, you're frightening me.
3252200	3254200	At the same time, you can hear Cicero's voice saying,
3254200	3259200	Yes, yes, I understand. Yes, it is going to change the world.
3259200	3263200	It's going to change. Yes, yes, it's going to change the world.
3263200	3265200	I must do as you will. I must do.
3265200	3276200	And then there is this noise, a loud banging sound, a loud wet sound.
3276200	3283200	And from the distant place you are within your own psyche, you can suddenly feel something warm and wet.
3283200	3286200	Splashing all over you.
3286200	3289200	Did I just pee?
3289200	3297200	Almost immediately, you're broken out of the connection you had, and you can see Cicero standing there,
3297200	3302200	just wavering backwards and forwards. The top of his head is largely missing.
3302200	3307200	There's fragments of blood splattered all over the place.
3307200	3310200	His mouth is just gawping open.
3310200	3314200	And then he falls heavily down on the ground.
3314200	3318200	Margaret Payne turns running, crying out.
3318200	3323200	And from the open wardrobe, you can just hear this buzzing voice, screaming angrily,
3323200	3326200	Release me!
3327200	3329200	Let's cut over to...
3333200	3334200	Oh my gosh.
3334200	3336200	Holy shit.
3336200	3337200	Wow.
3338200	3352200	I didn't know a body could be hollow before its blood ran cold.
3352200	3366200	I didn't know that the wind could sew the tissue and faggot bone.
3366200	3372200	You were hollow when you spoke to me.
3374200	3379200	Hollow when you sang.
3381200	3394200	I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.
3396200	3407200	Thorns and rocks and devils glow, brides and dried red clay.
3407200	3417200	Crocus blossoms in February and I live in May.
3418200	3427200	Time between a mother's fingers and spit off of a bridge.
3427200	3436200	Restless legs at 3pm while waiting for a fix.
3447200	3459200	I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.
3459200	3469200	I thought you might be starving, so I gave you everything.
3469200	3483200	So come back here and see what's left of me.
3483200	3493200	Is this the wholesome girl you left in Missouri?
3494200	3504200	My voice is nothing now but the howl of the wind.
3504200	3512200	Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.
3512200	3528200	Come closer dear in my teeth, thread her in my jaw.
