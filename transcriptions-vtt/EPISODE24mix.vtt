00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
Hello, my friends.

00:01.800 --> 00:04.780
It's your pizza delivery driver, Wolf the Dog.

00:04.780 --> 00:06.440
And I'm here to deliver you a box

00:06.440 --> 00:08.720
of hot, fresh, contention news pizza

00:08.720 --> 00:12.200
in 30 minutes or less, or you get your money back.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.620
And y'all know we are delivering

00:13.620 --> 00:16.080
that steamy, gooey, cheesy news

00:16.080 --> 00:20.080
straight from 694.2 PTBP.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.360
Wolf the Dog's favorite kind of pizza

00:22.360 --> 00:26.200
is mayonnaise pizza with anchovies on it.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.640
I like my pizza to have some extra stink on it,

00:29.640 --> 00:30.680
my babies.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.840
Now, before y'all burn the roof of your mouth

00:32.840 --> 00:36.080
on that hot delivery, we got an announcement.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.240
This week, Wolf is here to tell y'all

00:38.240 --> 00:40.640
that we are going to have a special presentation

00:40.640 --> 00:44.720
in a few weeks here on 694.2 PTBP,

00:44.720 --> 00:49.160
contention's newest and only radio station.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.800
We are going to broadcast a recap episode

00:51.800 --> 00:54.860
with listener Q&A from a podcast

00:54.860 --> 00:58.000
called Pretending to be People.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.480
If you have questions for any of the fine people

01:00.480 --> 01:03.240
on that show, send them to at Pretending Pod

01:03.240 --> 01:06.140
on Twitter or Instagram, or post them

01:06.140 --> 01:09.040
on our Facebook page or the subreddit,

01:09.040 --> 01:13.100
or email them to pretendingpod at gmail.com,

01:13.100 --> 01:14.300
or go all out.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.000
Record audio of you asking your questions

01:17.000 --> 01:19.280
and send them that so they can use it

01:19.280 --> 01:21.300
in the episode, my babies.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.120
Speaking of questions, I want answers.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.440
It's time for the news.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.600
Officer Keith Vigna convinced a woman

01:28.600 --> 01:32.320
to murder Ferguson, his handsome and well-dressed brother.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.800
He then murdered that woman and stole the watch

01:34.800 --> 01:37.120
that was passed down from William Beanes

01:37.120 --> 01:39.300
off of Fergie's corpse.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.200
Currently, Keith is in bed at Hotel Motel.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.240
Call him Ferguson, call him the Duke.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.640
Either way, he's a real motherfucker.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.280
Currently, Officer John Lee Pettymore

01:52.280 --> 01:54.640
and Drew Andrews are being held hostage

01:54.640 --> 01:57.800
by the Fonzie lady who works for Marvin Glass

01:57.800 --> 02:01.140
after she killed two of the Pettymore cousins.

02:01.140 --> 02:04.760
I'm grieving all week with you, John P.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.920
Officer Clark Bishop was inducted

02:06.920 --> 02:09.240
into the Circle of Knowledge.

02:09.240 --> 02:13.040
There, he ran into a mysterious woman from his past.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.640
Currently, Clark is in a cab headed back

02:15.640 --> 02:19.740
to contention from the mill on the other side of the city.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.440
There's always something happening in contention,

02:22.480 --> 02:27.480
and 100% of the time, it is Kudzu with no backbone.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.680
I had a guy jump in front of my car today

02:45.680 --> 02:47.040
and I thought I had killed him,

02:47.040 --> 02:48.880
and in fact, I think he might have been a ghost

02:48.880 --> 02:50.400
because I don't know how I didn't hit him.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.520
Wait, what?

02:51.520 --> 02:52.800
I was driving down town.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.800
Joe killed again, but he just kept going.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.640
That's exactly.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.800
I was driving downtown right in front of Jimmy John's.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.800
This guy was walking on the sidewalk,

02:59.800 --> 03:01.900
and I don't know if he was fucking with me

03:01.900 --> 03:03.920
or if he really was trying to commit suicide,

03:03.920 --> 03:05.800
but he did this big, exaggerated

03:07.800 --> 03:09.520
Oh, wow. leap in front of my car,

03:09.520 --> 03:11.320
and I didn't adjust.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.960
I mean, it was as if he wanted to slap my headlight.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.940
He was that close when he jumped,

03:16.940 --> 03:18.640
and I didn't feel a bump or anything,

03:18.640 --> 03:19.760
and I looked in my rear-view mirror,

03:19.760 --> 03:21.600
and he was just walking and looked at me

03:21.600 --> 03:24.220
and just kept walking with headphones on.

03:24.220 --> 03:25.440
I don't know what he was doing.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.500
I think he was fucking with me,

03:26.500 --> 03:29.780
but how I didn't hit him is still a mystery to me.

03:29.780 --> 03:30.620
It was insane.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.120
That's a dumb way to fuck with people.

03:32.120 --> 03:32.960
Yeah.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.480
My life in DJ.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.140
I know a hilarious prank.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.100
When I went to the movie today,

03:41.100 --> 03:44.160
I picked the second row in the very middle

03:44.160 --> 03:46.160
where no one else was sitting,

03:46.160 --> 03:50.160
and then I sit down, and the waiter comes up,

03:50.160 --> 03:51.000
and I look over,

03:51.000 --> 03:53.540
and the woman that had come in behind me

03:53.540 --> 03:57.640
with three very rowdy children comes and looks,

03:57.640 --> 03:59.960
and she goes, oh, I didn't realize you were sitting here,

03:59.960 --> 04:02.780
and sits right next to me with her three kids,

04:02.780 --> 04:06.240
and I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.380
Hey, I'm your dad now, kids.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.320
It wasn't a bunch of kids,

04:09.320 --> 04:10.960
but that happened to me at LMO

04:10.960 --> 04:12.040
where it was an empty theater,

04:12.040 --> 04:13.340
and I'd got my tickets early,

04:13.380 --> 04:17.020
and then one other guy had gotten the seat next to me.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.540
I was like, why would you have picked that,

04:18.540 --> 04:19.900
or why did they give you that seat?

04:19.900 --> 04:21.900
I don't understand how this happened.

04:21.900 --> 04:23.360
And she said something, she's like,

04:23.360 --> 04:24.840
oh, I'm so sorry, blah, blah, blah,

04:24.840 --> 04:25.700
and I was like, you know what?

04:25.700 --> 04:27.820
I came to a children's movie.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.920
I was kind of expecting kids to be here.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.900
I was like, just didn't expect somebody

04:32.900 --> 04:33.740
to sit right next to me,

04:33.740 --> 04:35.300
and she goes, you look really familiar,

04:35.300 --> 04:38.280
and it turns out I had served her at Jilardi's once,

04:38.280 --> 04:43.020
and she added me on Facebook a long time ago,

04:44.020 --> 04:46.820
but she can't be 30 years old, but like, yeah.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.500
So she was talking to me,

04:48.500 --> 04:50.340
but she was fucking talking to me the whole time,

04:50.340 --> 04:51.160
the whole movie.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.000
Oh, you want the movie?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.260
Yeah, dude.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.860
She did share her pizza and her popcorn with me though.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.080
That's cool as fuck.

04:57.080 --> 04:57.920
However.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.860
She wants you to raise those kids.

04:59.860 --> 05:02.380
No joke, she goes, you kind of look like the dad now,

05:02.380 --> 05:05.340
and I was like, yep.

05:05.340 --> 05:08.260
That was planned, that was a planned move.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.460
That was an absolute planned move.

05:10.460 --> 05:13.100
Jesus, she was going to the Alamo to get a hubby.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.260
Yep.

05:14.260 --> 05:16.560
And she would call you hubby too.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.800
I'm the dad now.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.420
She was like, I'll hit you up on Facebook

05:19.420 --> 05:20.740
next time I want to go see a movie.

05:20.740 --> 05:22.780
I was like, yeah, sure.

05:22.780 --> 05:23.940
Hold on just a second.

05:23.940 --> 05:28.340
What would have happened if you would have written on a card

05:28.340 --> 05:32.680
and told the people who work at Alamo

05:32.680 --> 05:34.020
that the woman sitting next to you

05:34.020 --> 05:36.300
won't stop talking to you?

05:36.300 --> 05:37.540
But it's just escorted her out,

05:37.540 --> 05:40.300
and you're like studiously not making eye contact.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.540
Just looks at it and then looks up at her and is like,

05:43.540 --> 05:47.300
ma'am, someone in the theater.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.540
When we do the dream sequence thing,

05:49.540 --> 05:53.020
is that going to be solo, red solo cup?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.860
Solo, dolo.

05:54.860 --> 05:58.140
Would you guys like to explain how this session is

05:58.140 --> 06:00.860
going to start, or at least what I told you

06:00.860 --> 06:01.980
and what you had to do?

06:01.980 --> 06:02.740
Oh, yeah.

06:02.740 --> 06:04.100
So you asked us.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.260
Gearing up to this session.

06:05.260 --> 06:09.460
You asked us to ask one yes or no question about the campaign

06:09.500 --> 06:13.460
that you would answer truthfully in the form of a dream.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.300
Wow, that was really succinct.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.580
But I don't remember my dream I had last night,

06:17.580 --> 06:19.420
so you might have to do it in real life.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.500
Can you tell us the dreams you gave us?

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
What?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.260
With your minds.

06:24.260 --> 06:27.620
Luke's joke was that you were putting dreams in our head.

06:27.620 --> 06:28.780
Which I do.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.500
Which is like, you do that.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.580
Yeah, you do pop up in my dreams a lot.

06:32.580 --> 06:33.500
That makes sense.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.320
Theoretically.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.240
Oh, that makes sense.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.080
Oh.

06:37.080 --> 06:37.900
That makes sense.

06:37.900 --> 06:38.740
Oh.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.180
I'm coming.

06:42.180 --> 06:45.420
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I'm coming.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.020
Oh, boy.

06:49.020 --> 06:50.300
You know, it's good to practice.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.940
My panties are wet.

06:52.940 --> 06:53.660
Same voice.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.820
Well, with that, we'll start with Luke.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.660
So do you remember the last thing

06:58.660 --> 07:00.580
that happened to Keith Wigner?

07:00.580 --> 07:01.860
I killed my brother.

07:01.860 --> 07:02.700
Yeah, basically.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.860
I orchestrated a plan to have my brother killed.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.100
Yeah, and then pulled it off pretty well.

07:09.620 --> 07:13.380
Also, yeah, I ended up, there's a little collateral damage.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.980
Not that Keith cares, but yeah.

07:15.980 --> 07:16.820
Jesus.

07:16.820 --> 07:17.980
What was her name, Joan?

07:17.980 --> 07:18.820
Joan.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.600
Joan and Fergie are both.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.860
Joan Robin.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.740
And the last thing I believe that you did

07:24.740 --> 07:26.700
was you made it back to Hotel Motel

07:26.700 --> 07:30.700
and you put the watch that Ferguson had been wearing

07:30.700 --> 07:33.640
within the handkerchief into your hotel safe.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.480
Yes.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.980
The motel's safe.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.740
And your room, and then you went to sleep.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.420
Keith Wigner, you are standing at a bar.

07:43.420 --> 07:46.620
It is empty, except for yourself and the bartender.

07:46.620 --> 07:49.140
The place smells like piss and vomit.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.880
It looks like people left in a hurry.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.320
The man behind the bar, he's like wearing clothes

07:54.320 --> 07:58.280
that they look like they're from the Gilded Age,

07:58.280 --> 08:00.140
you know, late 1800s.

08:00.140 --> 08:02.940
He looks at you with a fearful smile.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.700
What can I get you, sir?

08:06.700 --> 08:08.120
Answers?

08:08.120 --> 08:08.960
Cocaine?

08:10.580 --> 08:13.100
The prior, what's that, what do you say?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.340
The previous one, the first one.

08:15.340 --> 08:17.000
Not the latter.

08:17.000 --> 08:17.840
As soon as you.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.660
I got enough of that.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.780
As soon as you stumble over all of those words,

08:21.780 --> 08:25.020
the saloon-style doors of this wooden floor joint

08:25.020 --> 08:28.180
fling open as a woman that you recognize

08:28.180 --> 08:32.260
struts toward your side, carrying with her a massive trunk.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.620
She heaves it onto the bar and opens it up,

08:35.620 --> 08:38.400
revealing a few familiar items.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.180
The camera, the gun, and the radio

08:41.180 --> 08:43.300
are sitting there in the trunk.

08:43.300 --> 08:47.540
The camera's light is red, as is the light on the gun,

08:47.540 --> 08:50.100
but the light on the radio is green,

08:50.100 --> 08:51.880
and you hear yourself say,

08:53.100 --> 08:56.820
well, fuck, Mary, the camera won't be ready until one,

08:56.820 --> 08:58.900
and you know these other two take a few days.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.260
What if they came for me?

09:00.260 --> 09:01.620
What if they come for me?

09:01.860 --> 09:06.140
Immediately, she's gone, and Lloyd, the barkeep,

09:06.140 --> 09:09.620
pulls a corkscrew out of his pocket and holds it out,

09:09.620 --> 09:13.660
and holds it on the bar in front of you, pointy-side up.

09:13.660 --> 09:17.260
Abruptly, he slams his fucking head into the corkscrew

09:17.260 --> 09:20.580
and stares at you as he begins twisting the corkscrew,

09:20.580 --> 09:25.380
little bits of cocaine falling out of the hole in his head.

09:25.380 --> 09:28.940
You look down, and the coke has fallen into perfect lines,

09:28.980 --> 09:33.260
forming a little stick figure family of uppers.

09:33.260 --> 09:37.420
You pull out a $100 bill that has Abraham Lincoln on it,

09:37.420 --> 09:39.860
and you roll it up real tight.

09:39.860 --> 09:43.600
As you inhale the powder bumper sticker family,

09:43.600 --> 09:47.540
Lloyd steps backward, phasing through the wall of the bar,

09:47.540 --> 09:50.680
and disappearing from sight completely.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.580
You are pulling into the police department parking lot

09:53.580 --> 09:56.940
in your police cruiser, and you have that weird feeling,

09:56.940 --> 10:00.020
like you were on autopilot the whole drive.

10:00.020 --> 10:02.300
You were just remembering your dream from last night.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.980
That's not the only thing on your mind, though.

10:03.980 --> 10:07.740
You see yourself grabbing the revolver with your handkerchief,

10:07.740 --> 10:11.380
putting it in her hands, and pulling the trigger.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.060
You see the flash.

10:13.060 --> 10:16.980
You see her blood spill out onto the duvet cover.

10:16.980 --> 10:21.020
You're parked in the contention police department parking lot.

10:21.020 --> 10:21.860
Damn.

10:26.940 --> 10:34.340
John Lee.

10:34.340 --> 10:38.260
The ground is hard, wet, and cold.

10:38.260 --> 10:41.980
You are rolling across it with relative ease,

10:41.980 --> 10:45.380
avoiding the sight of the older man in the fancy suit

10:45.380 --> 10:48.460
mopping the floor and singing mouth trumpet,

10:48.460 --> 10:50.820
along with Louis Armstrong.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.220
Looking up out the window,

10:53.220 --> 10:56.300
you notice it is dark and stormy outside.

10:57.100 --> 11:01.180
The door that reads open from your side swings in,

11:01.180 --> 11:03.140
and the bell atop the door rings,

11:03.140 --> 11:05.500
queuing the owner of this establishment

11:05.500 --> 11:09.860
to stop his portable music player and holler,

11:09.860 --> 11:12.940
We're closed for the night, bud.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.780
You look up to the figure standing in the doorway,

11:15.780 --> 11:18.820
their black cloak shielding their identity,

11:18.820 --> 11:22.180
just as they drop a massive book on the ground

11:22.180 --> 11:24.980
and stumble back out into the night.

11:25.020 --> 11:28.220
Your vision blurs and distorts, disorienting you,

11:28.220 --> 11:31.460
and it feels like the world is upside down.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.900
You look around, and you are sitting on the floor

11:33.900 --> 11:35.580
in the back of clinkers.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.020
The sound of some children's television program

11:38.020 --> 11:40.980
being blared over pool balls and drunken conversation

11:40.980 --> 11:43.180
is immediately nostalgic.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.620
A young Gary Daley, an oversized sweater

11:46.620 --> 11:48.340
and tall white socks,

11:48.340 --> 11:53.340
walks in and pulls a large leather book out of his bag.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.580
He looks over his shoulder as he opens the book,

11:56.580 --> 12:00.300
and he winces as he rips a page from the big old tome.

12:00.300 --> 12:04.860
He pauses, listens, quickly puts the book back in his bag

12:04.860 --> 12:09.100
as he moves directly toward you with his torn sheet in hand.

12:09.100 --> 12:12.540
Pulling out a knife, Gary Daley begins chanting,

12:12.540 --> 12:14.860
reading from this paper.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.980
The script seems to catch little sparks

12:17.980 --> 12:21.740
as he mutters each phrase like a karaoke situation,

12:21.740 --> 12:24.060
but with paper and fire.

12:24.060 --> 12:27.660
He continues to chant as he presses the blade of the knife

12:27.660 --> 12:31.380
against his thumb, the elasticity of his skin

12:31.380 --> 12:33.060
gaining more and more tension

12:33.060 --> 12:36.140
until finally breaking under enough pressure

12:36.140 --> 12:40.020
and releasing the blood necessary to complete this spell.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.020
Gary Daley clenches his fist and holds it above your head,

12:44.020 --> 12:48.100
letting a few drops fall onto your bald baby head.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.620
The sparks ignite what remains of the paper

12:52.460 --> 12:54.700
and the flames begin to float and dance in the air.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.260
These tiny bits of flame do a little synchronized jig

12:58.260 --> 13:02.300
around your head, bathing your body in warm light.

13:02.300 --> 13:05.740
The flames disappear and Gary quickly grabs a rag

13:05.740 --> 13:07.940
and washes the blood off of your baby head

13:07.940 --> 13:10.300
while he talks to himself.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.460
Grandpa, you kooky old wizard.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.980
I hope this does him good.

13:13.980 --> 13:17.060
Well, two down, one to go.

13:17.060 --> 13:20.620
Hey, hey John, what are you thinking about?

13:21.660 --> 13:24.420
You realize you have pulled into the parking lot

13:24.420 --> 13:26.180
of the contention police department

13:26.180 --> 13:30.180
in Drew's cherry red Mini Cooper with black stripes.

13:30.180 --> 13:34.020
A terrified Drew Andrews is sitting silently next to you.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.780
A woman who fashions herself

13:35.780 --> 13:37.900
to look like Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli

13:37.900 --> 13:40.940
from the 1970s television program Happy Days

13:40.940 --> 13:44.780
is sitting in the back seat holding both of your guns.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.220
Now she still has the guns.

13:51.620 --> 13:56.620
Every move you make, every bond you break,

14:05.860 --> 14:09.740
every step you take, I'll be watching you.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.700
I'll be watching you.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.860
Oh, right.

14:14.860 --> 14:15.900
Joe, you remember the last thing

14:15.900 --> 14:17.060
that happened to Clark Bishop?

14:17.060 --> 14:18.580
Kinda.

14:18.620 --> 14:22.180
I think you kinda blacked out in an odd place

14:22.180 --> 14:26.060
and came to for a second in a taxi.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.780
Oh, you mean at the end, yeah, yeah.

14:27.780 --> 14:31.500
And you turned back and you were leaving the middle.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.060
Which is probably just a Quinkadink.

14:33.060 --> 14:34.020
Can't mean anything.

14:34.020 --> 14:34.980
Nope.

14:34.980 --> 14:38.780
You realize how close you are and so you begin to run.

14:38.780 --> 14:42.660
You do not stop, you do not slow, you run.

14:42.660 --> 14:46.140
It is imperative that you get there, that you stop them.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.780
Fuck, you're on the highway, you dodge the traffic,

14:49.780 --> 14:51.900
you can make it, you jump off the bridge.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.660
There's no way you're going to hit the water,

14:53.660 --> 14:55.300
you brace for impact.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.740
You've seen a lot of fucked up shit

14:56.740 --> 14:58.980
but you can't remember a time when your shin bone

14:58.980 --> 15:00.980
was shooting through your kneecap.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.540
Fuck, your pain tolerance is incredible.

15:03.540 --> 15:04.700
You keep running.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.780
It doesn't really look like running anymore

15:06.780 --> 15:08.460
but you fight through the awkwardness.

15:08.460 --> 15:10.540
The blood loss is massive.

15:10.540 --> 15:14.500
Then you see it, your old nemesis, your old buddy old pal.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.700
You remember why these animals are filling the creeks.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.860
You get the fuck in the creek too.

15:20.860 --> 15:22.540
Blood is trailing behind

15:22.540 --> 15:24.900
and the pain in your knee is searing.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.820
Your favorite black mass is following you

15:27.820 --> 15:30.620
along the shoreline and that's when you see it.

15:30.620 --> 15:32.780
You're just there in the window.

15:32.780 --> 15:34.780
Think fuck what happened stance.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.340
You keep hobbling down the creek

15:36.340 --> 15:39.540
trying to outpace your enemies before you're gone.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.820
At the closest point to your backyard,

15:41.820 --> 15:43.980
you muster everything in your reserves

15:43.980 --> 15:45.540
and leap out of the creek,

15:45.540 --> 15:48.340
waving your arms violently and shouting.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.420
You desperately attempt to get your attention.

15:51.420 --> 15:55.180
Run, run, get the fuck out of there.

15:55.180 --> 15:56.900
You can get it right this time.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.860
You wake up in the back of the cab

15:59.860 --> 16:03.180
as it makes a sharp turn and hits a curb.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.660
Looking out the window, you see that you have just arrived

16:06.660 --> 16:08.460
at the contention police department.

16:13.980 --> 16:18.980
Yeah, like a horse walks into a bar, yeah.

16:24.060 --> 16:27.020
Except it was not, he wasn't there for drinks.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.580
He was there for a fight.

16:28.580 --> 16:30.460
I was trying to think what I would do in that situation.

16:30.460 --> 16:33.020
You yell, why the long face?

16:34.340 --> 16:35.380
You get out of the way.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.860
Yeah, it's a horsey run.

16:37.860 --> 16:38.740
No, that's what I mean though,

16:38.740 --> 16:41.100
is the video, it's a really skinny room.

16:41.100 --> 16:44.460
No, yeah, it's a narrow, all along this long bar.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.100
One of the guys looks like he's about

16:46.100 --> 16:47.340
to get kicked in the face.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.540
I know, he looks resigned to it.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.100
He's like, I'm not gonna be able to outrun it,

16:51.100 --> 16:52.580
and I'm not gonna be able to get across its path.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.900
Is it jumping and stuff?

16:53.900 --> 16:55.580
Yeah, it's freakin' like,

16:55.580 --> 16:56.980
yeah, it's saddle broke or something,

16:56.980 --> 16:57.820
and it's freaking the fuck out.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.140
Oh, like a horse would in a restaurant?

16:59.140 --> 16:59.980
Yeah, exactly.

16:59.980 --> 17:01.660
Yeah, just kind of like that.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.100
It looks like a bucking Bronco

17:03.100 --> 17:04.980
going one way through this restaurant

17:04.980 --> 17:06.380
and then coming back the other way

17:06.380 --> 17:08.020
as people just fucking scatter.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.740
It made everyone a rodeo clown that day.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.700
It was kicking tables and chairs and shit.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.060
You could have had collateral damage either.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.380
It was kicking that shit so hard.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.580
It was like a cartoon flinging a chair back behind it.

17:19.580 --> 17:20.780
This was a terrified horse.

17:20.780 --> 17:22.100
On the news, it was like,

17:22.100 --> 17:23.180
they interviewed the owner,

17:23.180 --> 17:26.060
and it says, he likes to run away a lot.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.180
This isn't surprising.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.360
It's like, well, that's not good.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.340
Yeah, it's not.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.220
I brought it to this parade in the middle of town.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.620
Your horse is in my bar.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.300
Classic, classic Seabiscuit.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.180
I always thought that might happen someday.

17:41.020 --> 17:43.380
Did you at least get a cool video of it?

17:43.380 --> 17:45.980
Well, you got to look out for those chairs that are flying

17:45.980 --> 17:48.860
because they're flying at approximately one horsepower.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.340
Whoa.

17:50.340 --> 17:51.180
That was good.

17:51.180 --> 17:52.420
That was science.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.260
No, not boo.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.100
No, it's just true.

17:54.100 --> 17:54.940
Nay.

17:57.940 --> 17:58.940
Hey.

17:58.940 --> 18:00.020
The town of-

18:00.020 --> 18:02.300
Hey is for horse and strength.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.220
So close.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.820
So close to a seamless transition.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.780
Can I ask you an equestrian?

18:10.780 --> 18:12.780
Oh my God.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.060
Can we ask one more question?

18:14.060 --> 18:15.780
No, not bound by the truth.

18:15.780 --> 18:16.980
Yes, no restraints.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.740
Yeah, yeah, just shoot.

18:18.740 --> 18:19.580
Who did it?

18:19.580 --> 18:20.420
Who did it?

18:20.420 --> 18:22.100
He just doesn't have to tell us the truth.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.180
Here's the goo.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.940
Thomas's first question that he tried to send me was,

18:25.940 --> 18:26.860
who-

18:26.860 --> 18:29.780
No, what were the final hours of Maggie's,

18:29.780 --> 18:30.860
Chief Maggie's life?

18:30.860 --> 18:31.700
Nice.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.540
I was like, reveal that to me in a dream.

18:33.540 --> 18:34.740
Who killed her?

18:34.740 --> 18:35.860
Tell me who killed her.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.060
Art galore, dude.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.620
I will say, you told us a while ago

18:38.620 --> 18:41.060
that you might give us a chance to ask a question.

18:41.060 --> 18:43.620
So for a while now I've been thinking about

18:43.620 --> 18:46.660
really good heart of the issue questions

18:46.660 --> 18:48.500
that you would have to elaborate on.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.740
And when you gave us the yes or no right at the end there,

18:50.740 --> 18:51.860
I was like, fuck.

18:51.860 --> 18:55.580
Yeah, and I only gave you like 10 hours to think about it.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.020
I think mine was pretty good.

18:57.020 --> 19:00.540
The town of contention is draped in a thin layer of fog

19:00.540 --> 19:05.540
on this sharp blustery not yet morning of December 5th.

19:05.860 --> 19:09.660
There is an old Husky, a dirty shade of white,

19:09.660 --> 19:13.100
walking slowly down the middle of the road.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.500
The ancient dog's paw pauses mid-step

19:16.500 --> 19:19.780
when it hears the humming of car engines approaching,

19:19.780 --> 19:22.220
the only sound cutting through the dormant town

19:22.220 --> 19:23.980
aside from the howling of the wind.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.020
Through the arthritic pain pulsating through her joints,

19:28.020 --> 19:30.420
this old Husky bounds off the street

19:30.420 --> 19:33.180
and down an alley has three cars,

19:33.180 --> 19:36.540
a yellow taxi cab, a cherry red Mini Cooper

19:36.540 --> 19:40.420
with black stripes, and a contention police cruiser

19:40.420 --> 19:43.500
pull into the contention police department parking lot.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.820
John, do you wanna, or Thomas, do you wanna describe

19:47.820 --> 19:50.780
what they see in the Mini Cooper?

19:50.780 --> 19:55.180
Yeah, they see me, shit, sorry, I'm not Thomas.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.540
I'm John Leapa anymore, oh, fuck it.

19:57.540 --> 19:58.780
You can tell it's in Thomas.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.620
Yeah, they see.

19:59.660 --> 20:04.660
They see John Lee Pettymore, they see Drew driving his car,

20:08.260 --> 20:10.260
which they would recognize as his,

20:10.260 --> 20:13.380
and they see the Fonzie lady in the backseat.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.220
Okay.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.180
Does Clark have his wallet on him?

20:17.180 --> 20:18.460
Do we all get there at the same time?

20:18.460 --> 20:20.340
You all get there at the exact same time.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.460
Clark, you.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.460
Okay, so then they would also see John Lee Pettymore

20:23.460 --> 20:26.540
like eyes super wide, like yanking his head

20:26.980 --> 20:30.060
at the lady, like, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.180
Get a load of this.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.580
Do I have everything on me?

20:33.660 --> 20:35.620
You are wearing your pajamas,

20:35.620 --> 20:38.540
and you don't have your cell phone, or your wallet,

20:38.540 --> 20:40.340
or your gun on you.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.180
Okay.

20:41.180 --> 20:42.220
We're all in the parking lot.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.220
You're all in the parking lot.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.020
Okay, I get out of my cruiser.

20:45.020 --> 20:48.460
I assume I am, I've got all my police uniform and everything.

20:48.460 --> 20:49.300
Absolutely.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.720
I get out, and I wait for them to get out.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.060
So I say, what's her name?

20:54.060 --> 20:55.860
You don't know yet, you've never asked her.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.500
First of all, I say, all right,

20:57.500 --> 20:59.060
we never got this out of the way.

20:59.060 --> 21:01.180
First, I'm Officer John Lee Pettymore.

21:01.180 --> 21:02.660
Yeah, I know.

21:02.660 --> 21:03.500
What's your name?

21:03.500 --> 21:04.780
Rosemary.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.220
Rosemary, that's a very pretty name.

21:06.220 --> 21:07.060
Thank you.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.840
So check it out.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.380
If you wanna get that gun.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.420
Yeah, I do.

21:11.420 --> 21:13.780
Yeah, you're gonna have to give us our guns back.

21:13.780 --> 21:15.180
That's fine.

21:15.180 --> 21:18.300
Just so you know, if I go missing or anything,

21:18.300 --> 21:20.300
you're done, you're over.

21:20.300 --> 21:23.180
You will be taken, you will be tortured.

21:23.180 --> 21:26.460
Marvin Glass does not fuck around,

21:26.460 --> 21:28.660
and he wants this gun, he wants it real bad,

21:28.660 --> 21:30.460
and he's gonna get it.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.780
Rosemary, I really hope you understand

21:32.780 --> 21:36.160
that Marvin Glass is the least of my worries right now.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.180
And he can send all of his goons,

21:38.180 --> 21:42.180
but what we're dealing with is just a bit more stressful.

21:42.180 --> 21:44.960
That's why I want you to help me.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.140
So let's go get that gun.

21:46.140 --> 21:47.540
All right, let's go get that gun.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.340
Okay, my guns please though.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.180
Okay.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.220
All right, thank you.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.300
And she hands your gun back to you,

21:53.300 --> 21:56.460
and she hands the gun that you let Drew have back to him.

21:56.460 --> 21:57.300
I take it.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.020
Oh, okay.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.420
Also, you guys would all notice

22:00.420 --> 22:01.820
there's a car in the parking lot

22:01.820 --> 22:03.540
that none of you recognize.

22:03.540 --> 22:07.200
It is a red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.040
Hell yeah.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.400
I lean up to my cabbie.

22:10.900 --> 22:14.980
I'm a little short, I don't have my wallet on me, my man.

22:14.980 --> 22:17.300
Is there any chance I could get this right on the house,

22:17.300 --> 22:18.620
pay it back next time I see you?

22:18.620 --> 22:20.980
He turns and looks at you, and he's just like.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.420
Nope.

22:24.980 --> 22:28.220
Well, is this the Sesame Street taxi driver?

22:28.220 --> 22:29.300
It's Oscar.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.920
It's already been paid for.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.340
Oh, I was linching.

22:32.340 --> 22:36.500
Okay, you have a good night, and I get up.

22:36.500 --> 22:40.700
He drives off as your first foot steps out of the door.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.420
Clark, who was that spooky cab driver?

22:42.420 --> 22:46.300
He was just giving me a ride to the station here.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.780
Why don't you have, why are you in your pajamas?

22:49.780 --> 22:53.900
I was sleepwalking.

22:53.900 --> 22:54.740
Yeah?

22:54.740 --> 22:56.820
I must've ended up here sleepwalking.

22:56.820 --> 22:59.180
Well, you're a great liar, Clark.

23:01.340 --> 23:03.860
Everybody, I want y'all to meet Rosemary.

23:03.860 --> 23:04.700
Hey.

23:04.700 --> 23:05.780
Rosemary, this is everyone.

23:05.780 --> 23:06.620
Hey, I remember.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.260
I immediately get freaked out.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.100
Hey, it's okay.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.140
Keith, Keith, get your gun on her.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.500
No, no, no, no, guys, hold on, hold on.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.160
She doesn't have a, I got my guns, it's all good.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.300
How did you?

23:16.300 --> 23:18.700
It's okay, it's fine, we're working together,

23:18.700 --> 23:20.140
you guys are gonna give me the gun,

23:20.140 --> 23:21.460
and then we're all gonna be friends,

23:21.460 --> 23:22.620
everything's gonna be fine.

23:22.620 --> 23:24.460
Well, what's gonna happen, Rosemary,

23:24.460 --> 23:29.220
is that we're gonna go with you to the city with the gun.

23:29.220 --> 23:30.660
Yeah, sure, whatever, fine.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.920
We might give Marvin the gun

23:31.920 --> 23:34.180
if he really decides he wants it at the end of things, but.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.020
Okay.

23:35.020 --> 23:35.840
Yeah, I think he wants it.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.300
When did we decide all this?

23:37.300 --> 23:38.980
You weren't really there.

23:38.980 --> 23:42.500
You see, she had just executed two of my cousins

23:42.500 --> 23:44.340
for no particular reason.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.580
They were running away.

23:45.580 --> 23:47.060
Keith, get your gun on her.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.740
I've got two guns on her, and she's fine.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.620
I do have, I have my hand on my gun,

23:51.620 --> 23:53.340
but it's still holstered.

23:53.340 --> 23:56.620
Anyway, y'all remember, y'all remember the Glass boys?

23:56.620 --> 23:57.460
Oh, yeah.

23:57.460 --> 23:58.660
Jermaine and Albert, is it?

23:58.660 --> 23:59.480
Alfred.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.380
Alfred, one of whom disappeared,

24:01.380 --> 24:03.640
the other one wasn't, quit babbling about that gun.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.480
Yep.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.280
Well, so Rosemary here and Charles Donovan,

24:07.280 --> 24:10.180
they're in our little town, trying to find those boys,

24:10.180 --> 24:14.460
trying to find the gun that, Alfred, which one's around?

24:14.460 --> 24:15.820
Which one's gone, which one's around?

24:15.820 --> 24:18.860
Alfred's still around, but I mean, not really mentally.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.380
Yeah, he won't shut up about the gun,

24:20.380 --> 24:23.260
so Marvin Glass, that's Alfred's daddy.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.500
He really wants that gun.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.780
So we're gonna go talk to him?

24:25.780 --> 24:28.300
Well, Marvin Glass is the head of the Glass crime family,

24:28.300 --> 24:31.740
and I think if he wants his boy back,

24:31.740 --> 24:33.640
he has some considerable resources

24:33.640 --> 24:35.120
we might be able to call upon

24:35.120 --> 24:37.440
to help us fight this unholy terror

24:37.440 --> 24:39.060
that's descended upon our town.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.620
So I kinda made an executive decision,

24:40.620 --> 24:42.820
and I enlisted the mob to help us.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.220
I'm here, I'm the mob,

24:44.260 --> 24:46.620
and we're all gonna do great together, I think.

24:46.620 --> 24:50.580
The contention police department and the Glass crime family

24:50.580 --> 24:53.560
are going to be wonderful business partners

24:53.560 --> 24:54.780
from here on out.

24:54.780 --> 24:56.380
In temporary cahoots.

24:56.380 --> 24:58.540
And she puts her hand on Clark Bishop's shoulder.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.760
Yeah, Clark, you cool with that?

24:59.760 --> 25:00.680
Good, good.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.840
Keith, you cool with that?

25:01.840 --> 25:02.680
Sure.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.200
I elbow her and get away from the hand.

25:05.200 --> 25:09.060
I turn directly to John, why does Marvin want the gun?

25:09.060 --> 25:11.600
Well, okay, see, that's what's gonna happen,

25:11.600 --> 25:12.860
is Marvin wants the gun

25:12.860 --> 25:15.220
because he thinks he can turn his boy back around.

25:15.220 --> 25:17.400
We have just seen the gun disappear, people,

25:17.400 --> 25:20.060
so I don't think it doesn't really work that way,

25:20.060 --> 25:22.300
but I think if we all put our heads together,

25:22.300 --> 25:25.100
we can maybe bring some people back, like Tilly Bee.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.420
Rosemary leans forward,

25:26.420 --> 25:28.660
putting her head in the center of the group.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.660
I push her back out.

25:30.540 --> 25:31.940
Not Rosemary, this is.

25:31.940 --> 25:33.540
And I kinda close off for that gap.

25:33.540 --> 25:35.740
Oh, I thought we were putting our heads together.

25:35.740 --> 25:38.420
No, Rosemary, this isn't about you, really.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.540
So yeah, he wants that gun

25:41.540 --> 25:43.220
because he thinks it'll help his boy,

25:43.220 --> 25:44.740
or bring his boy back.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.540
I think the only way to get the boy back

25:46.540 --> 25:48.180
is to defeat this, you know,

25:49.380 --> 25:51.660
ancient evil that's descended upon us,

25:51.660 --> 25:54.860
and I think we might need more than just the three of us

25:54.860 --> 25:59.140
to do that, so I thought maybe a bunch of mafia gins

25:59.140 --> 26:00.180
would help things out,

26:00.180 --> 26:02.700
like, and one very motivated mafia boss

26:02.700 --> 26:04.160
trying to get his son back.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.000
Yeah.

26:05.000 --> 26:05.900
Do you see, I mean, because.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.260
I don't have any better ideas.

26:07.260 --> 26:08.860
Because they, like, the feds came by

26:08.860 --> 26:09.700
and they weren't much help,

26:09.740 --> 26:10.820
they're like, call this number

26:10.820 --> 26:12.260
if you don't solve it in two days,

26:12.260 --> 26:13.640
so I called the mob.

26:19.060 --> 26:22.660
John, when would we be heading up to the city?

26:22.660 --> 26:23.500
Right now.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.340
You guys don't, I was gonna go,

26:25.340 --> 26:26.540
me and Drew were gonna go,

26:26.540 --> 26:28.420
y'all can go though, it might be helpful too,

26:28.420 --> 26:29.780
but I don't know if we should leave,

26:29.780 --> 26:32.900
you know what, I mean, it's an hour away.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.100
Goo's not gonna eat the town in two hours, right?

26:35.100 --> 26:36.020
Well, I hope not.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.340
Did y'all see that dog on the way over here?

26:38.340 --> 26:40.140
Why was it out of the water?

26:40.140 --> 26:40.980
Oh.

26:40.980 --> 26:42.260
Y'all seen any more, have we,

26:42.260 --> 26:45.100
can I do a perception check or awareness check

26:45.100 --> 26:46.920
to see if I've noticed other dogs

26:46.920 --> 26:49.260
or animals wandering around like not.

26:49.260 --> 26:51.100
You wouldn't need to roll to know

26:51.100 --> 26:53.460
that it's been like this for a couple days now

26:53.460 --> 26:55.320
or there have been any animals,

26:55.320 --> 26:59.740
and this is absolutely the first animal you've seen

26:59.740 --> 27:01.620
not in water in a couple days.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.860
Okay, cool.

27:02.860 --> 27:04.300
How far back was that dog?

27:04.300 --> 27:05.660
It was right before we turned in, right?

27:05.660 --> 27:09.060
Let's go catch it or talk to it or pet it.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.300
Always thinking with your stomach.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.140
Pet it.

27:11.140 --> 27:11.980
Let's go pet it.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.660
It wasn't a black lab, was it?

27:13.660 --> 27:16.280
No, it was a husky, an old husky.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.060
Why, you having weird dreams or something about black labs?

27:19.060 --> 27:21.360
No, Kerry Page's dog's still missing.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.960
Yeah, I think we know the creek to find that dog in.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.180
It wasn't there when we passed it last night.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.020
Fuck, maybe that dog needs more of it.

27:29.020 --> 27:31.760
Well, maybe you should go get your clothes on.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.600
That's a good idea.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.900
One of you boys wanna give me a ride home real quick?

27:33.900 --> 27:36.460
Don't you not have extras in the lockers right in there?

27:36.460 --> 27:37.280
Do I?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.120
Yeah, absolutely.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.060
I'll go in and get changed.

27:39.060 --> 27:39.900
Yeah.

27:39.900 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, Clark, honestly, you're disgracing the badge right now.

27:42.000 --> 27:42.960
Just Clark going in?

27:42.960 --> 27:43.800
Yeah.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.920
Oh, no, I'm gonna go get that gun.

27:44.920 --> 27:45.760
Ah, right.

27:45.760 --> 27:47.660
I wanna stay out here and look at the dog,

27:47.660 --> 27:48.660
look for the dog.

27:48.660 --> 27:51.340
I wanna go inside with them.

27:51.340 --> 27:54.960
I toss the handgun to Drew, and I'm like, Drew, guard her.

27:56.420 --> 27:59.820
No, man, well, I guess we've got what she wants, so.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.020
He finally catches it.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.220
I'm like, all right, all right, all right.

28:04.220 --> 28:05.060
Everybody come in.

28:05.060 --> 28:05.900
You two come inside.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.020
Yeah, I'll come in.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.140
Follow us, Rosemary.

28:08.140 --> 28:08.980
Yeah, okay.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.760
As I'm heading toward the door, I notice that car.

28:10.760 --> 28:11.600
Yeah.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.260
And I don't open the door, and I look back at you guys.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.640
You guys know whose car that is?

28:14.640 --> 28:15.480
That red?

28:15.480 --> 28:17.000
No, I've never seen that car before.

28:17.000 --> 28:17.840
No idea.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.980
I look through the glass of the police department.

28:19.980 --> 28:21.420
Do I see anybody through the glass?

28:21.420 --> 28:22.780
You don't see anybody through the glass,

28:22.780 --> 28:26.900
but you do see that the desk that Drew uses

28:26.900 --> 28:29.380
that is within sight of the doorway

28:29.380 --> 28:33.340
has papers stacked super high on the desk

28:33.340 --> 28:35.580
that weren't there the last time you were at the station.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.820
And Drew normally keeps his desk pretty clean.

28:37.820 --> 28:39.700
Drew, give me that gun.

28:39.700 --> 28:40.780
Give it back, all right.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.480
Now get down, get behind one of these cars, Drew.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.320
Okay.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.820
A bigger one than your Mini Cooper.

28:44.820 --> 28:45.660
Okay.

28:45.660 --> 28:46.480
All right, be safe, buddy.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.060
I wanna go look inside that car.

28:48.060 --> 28:48.900
Okay.

28:48.900 --> 28:51.380
I wanna kick the door down holding both those guns

28:51.380 --> 28:53.820
and shout, freeze, motherfucker, contention PD.

28:53.820 --> 28:56.620
Okay, let's take those one at a time.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.060
So first, Keith, you walk over

28:59.060 --> 29:02.380
to the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

29:02.380 --> 29:04.260
Freeze, motherfucker, contention PD.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.780
I put my hands up.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.380
And do you, what do you do?

29:11.380 --> 29:12.500
You kick in the door?

29:12.500 --> 29:13.420
I'll wait.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.320
I'm about to, but I see him go over there,

29:15.320 --> 29:17.660
so I pause with my foot just like inches away.

29:17.660 --> 29:19.980
I put my finger up, I'm like, shh.

29:19.980 --> 29:20.820
Oh, I've got two guns.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.060
In case the car can hear us.

29:22.060 --> 29:22.900
Totally.

29:22.980 --> 29:27.100
You look inside of it and inside the car,

29:27.100 --> 29:32.100
you see there's a big container of creatine powder

29:33.180 --> 29:36.460
sitting in the floorboard of the shotgun seat.

29:36.460 --> 29:37.620
That's like protein powder, right?

29:37.620 --> 29:38.980
Protein powder, yes, sir.

29:38.980 --> 29:43.980
And you also see two empty cans of Red Bull, the big ones.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.580
The big ones.

29:46.580 --> 29:51.580
You also see a pair of Oakleys sitting on the seat,

29:51.660 --> 29:52.660
the shotgun seat.

29:53.260 --> 29:56.340
Boys, it looks like we're dealing with a strong foe here.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.180
A douchebag.

29:59.180 --> 30:00.220
We got a real douchebag here.

30:00.220 --> 30:01.380
Is this a two-door car?

30:01.380 --> 30:03.000
I believe it is a two-door car.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.780
All right, anything in the backseat?

30:04.780 --> 30:05.620
No.

30:05.620 --> 30:09.140
Okay, I turn around and I'm like, yeah, let's go inside.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.620
Okay, so yeah, I kick open the door and I shout,

30:11.620 --> 30:12.540
potential proof.

30:14.500 --> 30:18.620
Potention PD, contention PD, freeze, douchebag.

30:19.620 --> 30:24.620
And as you rush in, I assume, to the police department,

30:24.980 --> 30:30.140
you see a young man who was just previously

30:30.140 --> 30:32.780
walking furiously back and forth.

30:32.780 --> 30:36.020
He's frozen solid, hands up in the air.

30:36.020 --> 30:38.940
He's wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt

30:38.940 --> 30:40.460
and a red stripe tie.

30:40.460 --> 30:44.220
And in one hand, he is holding a large can of Red Bull.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.340
Drop it, party boy.

30:45.340 --> 30:48.140
He drops the can of Red Bull and it hits the ground

30:48.580 --> 30:51.740
and begins to spill onto the carpet,

30:51.740 --> 30:54.660
the like very thin, shitty carpet

30:54.660 --> 30:56.300
of the contention police department.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.940
Oh look, you made a mess in my police department.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.100
I come in behind John.

31:00.100 --> 31:04.020
I'm not, I'm just literally at his back talking over him.

31:04.020 --> 31:04.860
Who are you?

31:04.860 --> 31:08.460
Men, it seems that I have found myself

31:08.460 --> 31:12.100
the contention police officers that I am here to talk to.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.100
If you would come on down

31:14.100 --> 31:17.140
and reach into my jacket pocket here,

31:17.140 --> 31:18.860
I think we won't have an issue

31:18.860 --> 31:20.300
when you see, oh, it's a badge.

31:20.300 --> 31:21.620
It's not a gun, it's a badge.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.100
I do.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.460
John, you keep your gun on him.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.500
I also have my gun aimed at him.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.500
I'm heading over there

31:27.500 --> 31:29.180
and I'm reaching for the thing in my pocket

31:29.180 --> 31:31.140
as I go for his penis.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.180
The thing in your pocket?

31:32.180 --> 31:33.020
Yeah.

31:33.020 --> 31:33.860
The penis.

31:33.860 --> 31:34.680
Okay, oh shit, yeah.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.180
Okay, as you.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.300
And I'm going, I wanna see his badge.

31:38.300 --> 31:41.580
Okay, so you reach in just right there.

31:41.580 --> 31:42.700
Yes, it's that one.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.700
And you pull an FBI badge.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.940
As soon as I see it, I point up

31:47.780 --> 31:50.820
and shoot into the bottom neck area.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.340
Okay.

31:52.340 --> 31:55.060
All right, let's go ahead and roll.

31:55.060 --> 31:57.260
If you could roll a firearms check for me.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.780
Pass, 43 on an 80.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.780
All right, and he rolled an aught four,

32:02.780 --> 32:04.000
which means that you win.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.500
So yours is higher and passed.

32:05.500 --> 32:06.860
So describe what happened.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.500
Real quick, what were you competing on there?

32:08.500 --> 32:11.600
I used his alertness to see if he would recognize

32:11.600 --> 32:14.820
that it was coming in order to even try

32:14.820 --> 32:16.140
to resist the attack.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.020
Gotcha, okay.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.700
We don't talk about mechanics very much.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.660
I typically just roll, but yes, ask that more often.

32:21.660 --> 32:23.660
And I can always explain what I'm doing.

32:23.660 --> 32:25.260
I don't think that was a listener thing.

32:25.260 --> 32:26.100
That was just for me.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.060
Yeah, absolutely.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.500
I don't think anybody's gonna give a shit, but.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.860
I don't think the people who listen to this will care.

32:30.860 --> 32:32.900
If you give a shit, don't listen to us.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.700
Yeah, we are barely playing by rules.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.620
Oh, I am always cheating.

32:40.360 --> 32:45.360
Yeah, I rolled a critical success every time.

32:45.720 --> 32:46.720
High tension moment.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.340
So what happens?

32:48.340 --> 32:52.680
So I shoot and you guys see a little tranquilizer dart

32:53.560 --> 32:54.520
hit him.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.960
I hope it's really quick acting.

32:55.960 --> 33:00.960
He goes, oh my God, what in the world is going on?

33:02.080 --> 33:06.640
As he like starts to wobble and wobble

33:06.640 --> 33:08.540
and then he looks at you and he's like,

33:10.920 --> 33:14.440
hey, what's up?

33:14.440 --> 33:15.280
I look at the badge.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.120
What's the name on it?

33:16.120 --> 33:20.260
Agent Chad, Trent Chad, Trent Chad.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.400
Hey, hey, Chad, are you with me?

33:25.000 --> 33:25.880
I'm gonna need you to sit down

33:25.880 --> 33:27.800
and I kind of help him sit in the nearby chair.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.240
I love sitting.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.360
I turn back to John.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.520
I'll explain, but get Keith in here.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.940
Okay, my gun is on you now, by the way.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.360
Trust me, John, please.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.760
I do, you're Clark.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.240
Yeah, I will come in like, what are you doing?

33:41.240 --> 33:42.840
Wait, you got one of those for Rosemary?

33:42.840 --> 33:43.680
Do we need it?

33:44.440 --> 33:46.760
Yeah, hold on, what's going on here?

33:46.760 --> 33:47.600
How many you got?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.400
I think just one more.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.840
Is that just a trink or like what'd you just do?

33:51.840 --> 33:53.200
I'll explain to you guys.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.040
We can just shoot her.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.520
Here's what's going on.

33:55.520 --> 33:59.960
I had a, I hope you guys will respect my privacy.

33:59.960 --> 34:00.780
You're pretty.

34:00.780 --> 34:02.400
But I had some stuff happen last night

34:02.400 --> 34:03.780
and I just want you to trust me

34:03.780 --> 34:05.300
that I got it on good authority

34:05.300 --> 34:07.320
that the FBI was gonna be here this morning

34:07.320 --> 34:09.200
and that it was our job to make sure

34:09.200 --> 34:11.180
they didn't report back about all the crazy shit

34:11.180 --> 34:13.000
that was happening here in contention.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.360
You said good authority.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.160
They gave me this gun, these tranq darts,

34:17.160 --> 34:19.600
and they said that these darts are special

34:19.600 --> 34:21.400
and whoever we tranq them with,

34:21.400 --> 34:23.320
they'll have to obey our orders for a while.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.160
Okay.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.660
Do you know how long a while is, mechanically speaking?

34:26.660 --> 34:29.120
I don't know it in world or mechanically.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.520
I guess we'll just find out.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.220
I think our best bet though is to give them

34:33.220 --> 34:35.040
a bunch of instructions right the fuck now.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.200
Do we have to fry and pan them over the head?

34:38.520 --> 34:40.480
Well, hey man, that's really cool.

34:40.480 --> 34:41.920
It's a really cool gun you got there.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.680
What are we gonna tell them to do?

34:43.680 --> 34:45.140
My only thought is just to make sure

34:45.140 --> 34:47.140
he leaves and doesn't come back

34:47.140 --> 34:48.900
and whatever he tells his superiors

34:48.900 --> 34:50.900
is something that doesn't make them wanna come back.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.800
Okay, man, as much as I wanna send him

34:52.800 --> 34:54.820
on some hypnotized shenanigans,

34:54.820 --> 34:56.320
I think that's probably the best bet.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.760
Do you think that we'd have time

34:57.760 --> 35:00.240
for shenanigans afterward?

35:00.240 --> 35:01.160
Sure.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.200
That's true.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.360
Yeah, I was right behind you guys the whole time.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.120
I told, buddy, I told you to get the Honda car.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.840
Oh, yeah, I snuck in here, I guess, after.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.800
Did you get upset when you saw

35:11.800 --> 35:13.760
that your paperwork was all disturbed?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.760
Well, you know how I like my desk to always be clean.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.560
Hey, Drew, those papers over there,

35:18.560 --> 35:20.280
are they all yours or some of them his?

35:20.280 --> 35:21.600
Drew starts looking through.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.820
He has pulled out tons of files

35:23.820 --> 35:26.660
out of your filing cabinets and is sorting through them.

35:26.660 --> 35:27.500
They're all ours, though.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.320
Yeah.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.400
So, hey, buddy, who sent you here?

35:29.400 --> 35:32.320
Yeah, the FBI.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.160
And what did they tell you you might find here?

35:35.160 --> 35:38.400
Three of the worst police officers

35:38.400 --> 35:41.880
in the history of the United States of America.

35:41.880 --> 35:44.860
I guess that's, I guess that's you guys.

35:44.860 --> 35:47.040
I wouldn't normally take immense offense to that,

35:47.040 --> 35:50.720
but I understand that in today's law enforcement,

35:50.720 --> 35:53.240
it's often more of a PR game than anything,

35:53.240 --> 35:56.240
and frankly, we've been within' that pretty mightily.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.700
So you might not know what we're doin'

35:57.700 --> 35:59.160
to actually save the world.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.280
I think we're probably the best police officers

36:01.280 --> 36:02.920
in America, I would say.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.000
Hey, Chad, you ever, certainly the bravest.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Have you ever conducted a press conference?

36:08.520 --> 36:10.840
You ever conducted a press conference for yourself?

36:10.840 --> 36:15.120
Press conferences are my specialty.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.780
Guys, what if we have him calm down?

36:16.780 --> 36:17.620
The popular is awesome.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.200
Yes, Chad.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.880
I'm very good with public relations.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.480
Everyone loves me all the time, mostly.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.600
Why wouldn't they?

36:26.600 --> 36:27.440
Yep.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.160
Yeah, so can you relate to the public for us?

36:29.160 --> 36:31.080
What should we tell him that is goin' on, then?

36:31.080 --> 36:33.240
What if we, oh, shit.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.000
Well, what we'll tell him is that there has been,

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
well, it's super dark, but here's a possible,

36:42.240 --> 36:44.260
here's a possible cover story.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.280
All right, we tell them that contention

36:46.280 --> 36:49.080
is a crossroads for human trafficking,

36:49.080 --> 36:50.920
and that all their children and people

36:50.920 --> 36:54.280
that then disappeared are in slavery.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.720
Yeah, so what he's gonna say is that the FBI

36:56.720 --> 36:59.200
has a task force on the way.

36:59.200 --> 37:03.400
The meager resources of the contention PD were overwhelmed,

37:03.440 --> 37:07.200
despite the brave efforts of all the officers here,

37:07.200 --> 37:12.080
and that if you see anything, like black goo-related,

37:12.080 --> 37:14.560
why don't you just call on in to Drew down here

37:14.560 --> 37:17.380
at the hotline and let him know?

37:18.880 --> 37:20.600
Maybe not the black goo.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.960
Maybe not the black goo.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.120
Maybe just the stuff flattering us.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.960
We could tell him to give the contention PD

37:26.960 --> 37:28.200
as wide a berth as possible,

37:28.200 --> 37:30.200
that they are still part of the task force

37:30.200 --> 37:32.400
and are the feet on the ground.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.040
Don't interfere with us.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.900
We should also say we're working closely

37:35.900 --> 37:37.560
with the first church of contention.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.400
I had a wiper.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.840
I was thinking we might have a conference at the church.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.000
Yeah.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.080
Clark, you are.

37:43.080 --> 37:43.920
That's good.

37:43.920 --> 37:44.880
You're a genius.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.640
Clark is a, he's kinda rocking back on his heels,

37:48.640 --> 37:50.720
a little bit proud of that.

37:50.720 --> 37:54.560
So do we wanna have that untelevised event that he does

37:54.560 --> 37:57.300
and then send him on his way back and say,

37:57.300 --> 37:59.160
they got it under control,

37:59.160 --> 38:01.120
or actually have the FBI come out here

38:01.120 --> 38:02.480
and no, we don't want them to come.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.440
No, I think we have them do the press conference

38:05.440 --> 38:07.400
and then get the fuck out of town

38:07.400 --> 38:08.680
and don't ever come back.

38:08.680 --> 38:09.520
Don't ever come back.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.760
Tell his superiors that it must have been a false alarm

38:12.760 --> 38:14.920
that contention PD's got everything under control

38:14.920 --> 38:15.760
in that town.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.100
Bizarre internet hoax.

38:17.100 --> 38:17.940
There you go.

38:17.940 --> 38:20.280
It's just a attack on small town America.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.260
What time do you guys wanna have this conference?

38:22.260 --> 38:23.100
Cause we're gonna need to.

38:23.100 --> 38:23.920
We should do it today.

38:23.920 --> 38:24.760
What time is it right now?

38:24.760 --> 38:25.600
Early.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.700
It is super early.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.600
It's like five in the morning, 4.30 in the morning.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.440
You know what?

38:30.760 --> 38:32.120
We don't know how much longer

38:32.120 --> 38:34.220
these truth serum darts are gonna work.

38:34.220 --> 38:35.060
Let's hold it.

38:35.060 --> 38:35.880
Whatever you wanna call it.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.220
A 10 a.m. press conference.

38:37.220 --> 38:38.060
I'm hoping.

38:38.060 --> 38:38.880
No, no, no, no.

38:38.880 --> 38:39.920
What we gotta do is go down to that church

38:39.920 --> 38:42.120
right the fuck now, get up on the auditorium,

38:42.120 --> 38:44.520
film one of them on our smartphones

38:44.520 --> 38:46.320
and get him out of here.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.160
And then go back to business.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.720
I don't think it should be filmed though.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.040
That's not a bad idea if we film it

38:50.040 --> 38:52.960
and just give it to the local television station

38:52.960 --> 38:54.040
on the morning news.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.900
We can pose in front all Mr. Science theater style,

38:56.900 --> 38:59.520
just silhouetted acting like reporters.

38:59.520 --> 39:00.840
Hank, question.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.060
Clark is already heading toward the evidence locker

39:03.060 --> 39:06.100
to find the camera that we always use for filming things.

39:07.080 --> 39:07.920
Okay.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.760
Absolutely.

39:08.760 --> 39:09.580
I like that.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.420
And then we'll send it into.

39:10.420 --> 39:11.260
When you go back there.

39:11.260 --> 39:15.460
What is the local news channel?

39:15.460 --> 39:17.240
We probably just get the city news out here.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.600
Yeah, that's right.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.720
We're only an hour away.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.640
Probably the only news around is the city.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.080
Well, there's probably a couple radio.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.800
I mean, of course there's a couple radio stations

39:26.800 --> 39:28.080
that we all listen to and love.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.180
Local talk radio.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.540
Oh, let's do that.

39:30.540 --> 39:32.020
Let's do a public service announcement on the radio.

39:32.020 --> 39:35.700
You could even have Wolf the dog post it.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.540
Yeah.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.260
Well, everybody in town loves Wolf the dog.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.340
That's true.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.620
Okay, I like the idea.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.140
All right, let's get this done quick.

39:42.140 --> 39:43.580
We can just record it right here then.

39:43.580 --> 39:44.420
Yep.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.380
All right, say this idiot.

39:45.380 --> 39:46.220
What?

39:46.220 --> 39:49.220
Drew, top up something pretty for this dumb ass to say.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.540
Okay, what the fuck?

39:52.900 --> 39:53.740
I have to do it all.

39:53.740 --> 39:54.580
No, you have to do it all.

39:54.580 --> 39:57.540
I don't know if it's necessary that we even say anything

39:57.580 --> 39:59.300
because we've said what he's gonna say.

39:59.300 --> 40:03.180
The bullet points that we wanna hit are everything's okay,

40:03.180 --> 40:06.580
let the contention PD do whatever the fuck they want.

40:06.580 --> 40:08.500
And don't worry, everything's gonna be all right.

40:08.500 --> 40:11.620
And that everything the contention PD has been doing

40:11.620 --> 40:15.560
has been a-okay, what we needed them to do.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.740
Above and beyond.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.740
Don't worry, but be careful out there.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.220
Yep.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.480
So we have him say that.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.320
Yeah.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.140
Awesome.

40:23.140 --> 40:26.100
We can have Drew email it over to Wolf the dog.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.020
For immediate release.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.140
Yeah, for immediate release.

40:29.140 --> 40:29.980
Yeah.

40:29.980 --> 40:33.380
Haven't played a couple times over the course of the day.

40:33.380 --> 40:34.220
Perfect.

40:34.220 --> 40:35.040
Well, cause that's the thing,

40:35.040 --> 40:36.860
this is gonna be a big news.

40:36.860 --> 40:37.780
They're gonna want this.

40:37.780 --> 40:38.620
They're not gonna want it.

40:38.620 --> 40:39.440
This is hot shit.

40:39.440 --> 40:40.280
They're not gonna want it.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.120
Hot shit.

40:41.120 --> 40:44.780
Well, they've been waiting to hear something from you guys.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.740
That was mostly Drew's fault.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.460
Oh, and tell them to repeat it.

40:48.460 --> 40:49.420
Oh, hey, yeah.

40:49.420 --> 40:52.280
Should we have somebody else besides Drew email him?

40:52.280 --> 40:53.420
Remember when he didn't tell us

40:53.420 --> 40:55.760
about those 30 missing people?

40:55.760 --> 40:57.840
I think his heart's in the right place, but.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.860
Well, you guys are right here.

40:58.860 --> 40:59.700
You can watch me.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.560
We can all email them together.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.760
Drew, the whole point of your job

41:03.760 --> 41:05.180
is that you're supposed to be able to do it

41:05.180 --> 41:06.400
while we're not watching you.

41:06.400 --> 41:11.400
Yes, and that was an excellent opportunity for this story.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.760
Well, you can prove yourself to us by doing it correctly.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.600
And how about you get dressed?

41:16.600 --> 41:17.440
Yeah, buddy.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.840
And let's do the next thing.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.680
Retroactively.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.200
As soon as agent is done recording.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.040
Can we start over?

41:23.040 --> 41:23.880
Can we start over?

41:23.880 --> 41:25.480
As soon as the agent is done recording

41:26.040 --> 41:27.600
and maybe those two are getting the emails sent off,

41:27.600 --> 41:29.120
I'm telling them about.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.440
And now I'm gonna need you to go back to your superiors

41:32.440 --> 41:34.780
and tell them kind of what you said on that news broadcast,

41:34.780 --> 41:37.560
that everything's okay here in the contention area.

41:37.560 --> 41:38.400
Yeah.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.580
And that there's no reason to send anybody else down here

41:41.580 --> 41:42.720
for a while at least,

41:42.720 --> 41:44.580
but you probably never need them again.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.880
It's just an internet hoax.

41:45.880 --> 41:46.920
So I did it?

41:46.920 --> 41:47.960
I did it right?

41:47.960 --> 41:49.840
I just solved the case, buddy.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.840
I pat him on the back.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.660
You did.

41:51.660 --> 41:52.500
You did.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.340
You killed him.

41:53.340 --> 41:54.160
And he was your boss.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.000
I'd give you a promotion.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.360
You look strong and energized.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.000
You look swole, buddy.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.200
Thank you.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.280
Look at them wings.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.880
I appreciate it.

42:01.880 --> 42:05.880
I'll just go get in my car.

42:05.880 --> 42:06.840
Hey, wait, real quick.

42:06.840 --> 42:07.920
Before you fucking go,

42:07.920 --> 42:09.640
could you mop up that Red Bull you spilled?

42:09.640 --> 42:10.880
Yeah, of course.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.440
All right, thanks, you dumb piece of shit.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.880
And then I shoot him dead.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.360
Oh no, we're gonna have to lure another FBI agent down here

42:20.360 --> 42:22.040
and hypnotize him all over again.

42:22.880 --> 42:25.720
And he's gonna have to clean up this mess.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.360
No, I don't shoot him.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.880
I failed my firearm, shit.

42:31.960 --> 42:35.440
Clark, when you go to the back of the police station

42:35.440 --> 42:37.980
to grab your change of clothes,

42:37.980 --> 42:42.060
you have a habit of peeking in on the cells.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.680
There's no one in the cells.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.040
Dr. Murray Jacobs is gone.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.820
Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body of Doug Jacobs

42:50.820 --> 42:53.440
are no longer in the cells.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.180
Are all our artifacts still there?

42:55.180 --> 42:57.940
The cell doors are locked.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.220
I do the cartoon walk by and then slowly walk back.

43:04.220 --> 43:06.420
And you confirm.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.260
No one's there.

43:07.260 --> 43:09.220
Hey, boys, I'm still gonna get changed,

43:09.220 --> 43:12.480
but cells are empty, God fucking damn it.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.900
I go back and get changed.

43:13.900 --> 43:16.780
But just the people are gone, not our stuff.

43:16.780 --> 43:17.740
The stuff is in a locker.

43:17.740 --> 43:19.740
The stuff is in the evidence room, I think.

43:19.740 --> 43:20.580
None of us let them out.

43:20.580 --> 43:22.560
Just look for yourself as I kind of motion

43:22.560 --> 43:23.740
with a hand over toward them.

43:23.740 --> 43:25.860
Okay, we go check it out.

43:25.860 --> 43:28.460
Hey, Clark, did you notice that everybody's gone?

43:29.860 --> 43:31.040
I don't respond.

43:31.980 --> 43:32.820
Put my clothes on.

43:32.820 --> 43:33.820
What the fuck?

43:33.820 --> 43:38.260
I check the doors to make sure that they're actually locked.

43:38.260 --> 43:39.540
They're locked and secured.

43:39.540 --> 43:42.140
Well, this is a quandary.

43:42.140 --> 43:44.000
I come back into the room fully dressed.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.080
Oh, hey, I check the locks.

43:46.080 --> 43:48.540
I tried Murray Jacobs' cell phone number,

43:48.540 --> 43:53.340
which I assume we acquired during routine police paperwork.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.620
Yeah, that flies.

43:54.620 --> 43:57.380
It goes to voicemail immediately, it doesn't ring.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.220
I turn to Drew.

43:58.220 --> 44:00.380
Hey, Drew, when was the last time you noticed them in there?

44:00.380 --> 44:02.540
Well, they were in there last night.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.420
Isn't it last night right now?

44:04.420 --> 44:06.980
Well, they were in there like seven hours ago, for sure.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.980
Well, it's a good thing we're in a police station

44:08.980 --> 44:11.260
with cameras, let's go check those.

44:11.260 --> 44:12.100
Nice.

44:12.100 --> 44:13.280
A fist bump, Keith.

44:14.280 --> 44:18.520
Watching the security footage of the last couple of hours

44:18.520 --> 44:23.200
fast forwarding through, you see the cat in your police station

44:23.200 --> 44:26.960
running all over the place, constantly jumping, jumping,

44:26.960 --> 44:30.120
jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping from spot to spot

44:30.120 --> 44:32.760
to spot, hiding, running, running.

44:32.760 --> 44:37.520
And when you are watching the footage of the cells,

44:37.520 --> 44:41.280
you see both Dr. Murray Jacobs and the body

44:41.320 --> 44:46.520
of Doug Jacobs silently just get really scared

44:46.520 --> 44:48.480
and move back up against the wall,

44:48.480 --> 44:50.360
and they start kind of moving away.

44:50.360 --> 44:55.000
And then all of a sudden, you see their bodies picked up

44:55.000 --> 44:57.760
off the ground and slammed into the ground

44:57.760 --> 44:59.820
and slammed into the ground.

44:59.820 --> 45:04.520
And then as if they were never there, they are gone.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.600
What the hell could that have been?

45:06.600 --> 45:09.120
If you guys could go ahead and roll sanity.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.400
Do we need to?

45:10.440 --> 45:12.360
That's a really good point, because you have seen this

45:12.360 --> 45:13.960
happen a lot of times.

45:13.960 --> 45:16.360
We just know what it is, but I pass anyway.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.000
And especially because it was also on camera,

45:20.000 --> 45:21.880
I won't call for a sanity roll there.

45:21.880 --> 45:25.200
I want to rewind the tape and get to the very moment

45:25.200 --> 45:27.480
that the cat started freaking out and see if I can tell

45:27.480 --> 45:30.120
which direction it was looking when it started freaking out.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.200
Interesting.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.000
Did the cat get gooed too?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.120
You didn't see the cat disappear.

45:35.120 --> 45:39.120
As you're finding the spot where the cat got freaked out,

45:39.120 --> 45:40.260
it was looking up.

45:41.660 --> 45:42.520
I look up.

45:42.520 --> 45:47.120
You see the paneled ceiling of the police department.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.280
You know, the kind of ceiling that they have in classrooms

45:49.280 --> 45:50.600
that you can throw pencils into.

45:50.600 --> 45:51.440
Drop ceiling.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.280
Drop ceiling.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.100
Drop ceiling.

45:53.100 --> 45:56.600
So, hey, y'all remember when the body of John Peters

45:56.600 --> 45:59.800
fell from the sky onto my cop cruiser?

45:59.800 --> 46:00.640
Do you think?

46:00.640 --> 46:01.480
Oh, yeah.

46:01.480 --> 46:02.320
Mm-hmm.

46:02.320 --> 46:03.160
I don't know.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.920
That happened up, you know what I mean?

46:05.920 --> 46:06.920
The sky opened.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.320
Well, I mean, that happened.

46:08.840 --> 46:09.720
Cat was looking up.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.360
Happened in the junkyard body.

46:11.360 --> 46:12.640
Happened.

46:12.640 --> 46:13.900
We're not talking about the slamming.

46:13.900 --> 46:15.600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

46:15.600 --> 46:18.040
Is that, yeah, the falling from the sky is.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.480
Yeah, the falling from the sky.

46:19.480 --> 46:22.560
Is different, but they got smashed repeatedly

46:22.560 --> 46:24.920
into the ground and then disappeared.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.320
Julie Maxwell and Leo Piston.

46:27.320 --> 46:30.120
Got smashed into the ground and then disappeared.

46:30.120 --> 46:30.960
John Peters.

46:30.960 --> 46:35.280
John Peters fell from the sky and did not disappear.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.360
The first body fell and didn't disappear.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.400
Good work, yep.

46:39.400 --> 46:40.520
Very succinctly put, Keith.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.360
Thank you.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.000
Seems like we might be dealing with the same.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.640
Do you think it's all the same goo?

46:45.640 --> 46:47.240
Probably all the same goo.

46:48.160 --> 46:51.840
And we, did we figure out,

46:51.840 --> 46:54.400
we think that the animals can see the goo?

46:54.400 --> 46:55.240
Well, they can sense it.

46:55.240 --> 46:59.280
Animals have a pretty natural awareness.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.800
What if we all turn into cats?

47:02.040 --> 47:04.360
Clark, right now, I think that's best case scenario.

47:04.360 --> 47:07.600
And then we could just run free, John.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.560
Well, I think we're gonna have to wait

47:08.560 --> 47:10.920
till the radio turns back on.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.960
We're gonna have to wait till the radio turns back on

47:13.960 --> 47:17.400
to test that theory out.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.600
I kind of do a sheepish laugh.

47:20.520 --> 47:21.360
We can't do that.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.240
Real quick, I don't know how any of this all works,

47:24.240 --> 47:27.440
but I was thinking about, I think at some point,

47:27.440 --> 47:29.320
one of us is probably gonna have to shoot ourselves

47:29.320 --> 47:31.200
with that gun to go to this other place

47:31.200 --> 47:32.760
where all this weird shit and those photographs

47:32.800 --> 47:33.960
are coming from.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.200
And then maybe the radio, or the helmet.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.120
One of them, I think there's a sequence maybe

47:38.120 --> 47:40.600
that takes you there and brings you back.

47:40.600 --> 47:43.200
But I'm not sure what swapping bodies has to do with it.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.040
Maybe one of us has to die.

47:44.040 --> 47:46.720
Well, we'll be able to take a picture again today.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.920
Why?

47:49.920 --> 47:52.520
I don't know why.

47:52.520 --> 47:56.280
So, you think it's on a daily timer?

47:56.280 --> 47:57.280
Why did you say that?

47:57.280 --> 47:59.360
Did you have some kind of weird dream about that?

47:59.360 --> 48:01.040
I don't know, I just, it was,

48:01.040 --> 48:02.660
I felt like that was just in my mind.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.340
I don't know how I knew that.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.940
So, something I was thinking about is the last time.

48:06.940 --> 48:08.660
I think maybe around one o'clock today,

48:08.660 --> 48:10.480
we'll be able to take that picture.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.140
That's specific, Keith.

48:12.140 --> 48:14.820
It's just, it's in my mind, it's a hunch.

48:14.820 --> 48:16.060
I don't know how I know it, though.

48:16.060 --> 48:19.060
Yeah, all right, what the hell do you know, buddy?

48:19.060 --> 48:21.980
Hey, Keith rolled to be a better liar.

48:21.980 --> 48:24.780
Keith rolled to lie to us right now.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.620
Is it weird shit?

48:26.620 --> 48:29.060
I don't know, I just, it popped into my head.

48:29.060 --> 48:31.120
I put my hand on Keith's shoulder.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.900
Weird shit is all around us, man.

48:32.900 --> 48:35.120
If you just happen to know this, I fucking believe you, man.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.380
I just knew it.

48:36.380 --> 48:38.520
I don't know, I can't remember how or what.

48:38.520 --> 48:39.640
Did we not all know that?

48:39.640 --> 48:42.120
Can I do a hument to see if he's lying about

48:42.120 --> 48:43.120
just knowing that?

48:43.120 --> 48:46.760
I don't like to play where you can roll hument

48:46.760 --> 48:48.400
against other players.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.260
Oh, so Luke just gets the bullshit.

48:50.260 --> 48:54.400
We've also, so early on, there was a time I played

48:54.400 --> 48:57.200
with a different group and somebody had an incredibly

48:57.200 --> 49:01.480
high Persuade and they just forced Dean's player

49:01.480 --> 49:05.700
to keep doing stupid stuff by rolling Persuade against him.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.640
Yeah, that doesn't sound fun.

49:08.640 --> 49:09.480
I mean, it sounds fun.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.520
No, it's objectively the worst scenario.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.440
That's a really good point about, yeah.

49:12.440 --> 49:17.120
It was really funny for everyone except for Dean.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.800
Which is annoying, I'd be like, okay, well,

49:20.800 --> 49:22.320
you can just play my character then.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.040
Yeah, so I don't like it.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.040
What are the recourses for discovering

49:27.040 --> 49:28.460
if a player is lying to you?

49:28.460 --> 49:29.300
What do you think?

49:29.300 --> 49:30.680
Well, I was about to say, if you want to play it out.

49:30.680 --> 49:33.180
I've kind of just said that I believe him.

49:33.180 --> 49:34.960
Yeah, so let's role play it.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.400
You can not believe me if you don't want.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.080
I don't believe that you just don't.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.200
I think you got more you're not telling us.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.040
Well, that's-

49:41.040 --> 49:43.320
Is there any reason why you're not telling us?

49:43.320 --> 49:44.880
Honestly, it just popped in my head.

49:44.880 --> 49:48.080
I thought maybe, did we not already know?

49:48.080 --> 49:50.920
You know, I might be wrong even, let's just see.

49:50.920 --> 49:52.920
Let me go check and see, is it red still?

49:52.920 --> 49:55.840
You guys walk into the evidence locker

49:55.840 --> 50:00.400
and you see the helmet and it's light is red.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.120
You see the camera, it's light is red.

50:03.120 --> 50:05.680
You see the gun, it's light is red.

50:05.680 --> 50:08.320
And you see the radio and it's light is green.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.480
Oh!

50:10.480 --> 50:11.360
Oh!

50:40.480 --> 50:41.320
Oh!

51:10.480 --> 51:11.320
Oh!
