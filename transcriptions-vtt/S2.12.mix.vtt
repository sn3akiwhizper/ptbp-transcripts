00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Salutations and vibrations, my faithful listenership.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.520
It's your large and in-charge DJ Wolf the Dog.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.040
I am sending vibrations of various lengths to you

00:14.040 --> 00:18.760
live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.480
The only radio station.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.960
It's the only one, folks.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.800
Do not attempt to listen to any others.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.480
They do not exist.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.280
Hands off that dial.

00:30.280 --> 00:35.280
Do not turn your ears away from Wolf or else.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.320
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Jared

00:38.320 --> 00:41.440
in Houston, Texas, who tweeted about the show

00:41.440 --> 00:44.000
and tagged at Pretending Pod.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.520
And now he gets to send this wolfy memorandum

00:47.520 --> 00:52.520
to Oliver in Mishawaka, Indiana.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.420
Jared writes, to Oliver Chestnut,

00:56.420 --> 00:58.820
you are my greatest and best friend.

00:58.820 --> 01:01.460
We have shared laughter and love,

01:01.460 --> 01:04.780
memories that will last until the stars are right,

01:04.780 --> 01:09.780
and most importantly, comedy TTRPG podcasts.

01:10.020 --> 01:14.060
The journey may be long and the old ones may be near,

01:14.060 --> 01:16.820
but so long as I walk the path with you,

01:16.820 --> 01:19.060
it will be a road worth taking.

01:19.060 --> 01:22.500
Whether we are vampire cops datin' their partner,

01:22.500 --> 01:25.940
archimites checkin' out the cold Corbett house,

01:26.460 --> 01:29.380
or Delta Green agents vibin' on reverb,

01:29.380 --> 01:33.460
I'm glad that it was us who took those journeys.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.460
Well, technically you took those journeys.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.940
I was busy playin' God and found it a game worthy of me.

01:40.940 --> 01:45.940
May your smile shine and your hair always be anime colored.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.100
Love, Jared.

01:48.100 --> 01:52.620
PS, Fuck Mark Zuckerberg and Fuck Jack Dorsey.

01:52.620 --> 01:57.620
PPS, love and energy to those pretending pod fellas,

01:57.900 --> 02:02.740
and to the original phantom of truth, Wolf the dog.

02:02.740 --> 02:06.460
Jared, thank you for this internet mail.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.500
I appreciate all forms of mail.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.780
The internet kind, those ones are good.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.940
You mainly said a lot of things about Oliver,

02:15.940 --> 02:17.420
and that's good stuff.

02:17.420 --> 02:21.060
We love to see it, and I hope Oliver appreciates

02:21.060 --> 02:24.220
all the weird stuff you made me say out loud.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.660
But the it that I love to see

02:26.660 --> 02:30.980
is you sayin' that good, good stuff about little old me.

02:30.980 --> 02:34.740
Smiles and kisses to you, dear Jared.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.620
If you wanna write up somethin' for your Wolf the howl,

02:37.620 --> 02:41.060
tag at pretending pod on Twitter or Instagram,

02:41.060 --> 02:43.700
tag pretendin' to be people on Facebook,

02:43.700 --> 02:45.460
or write up a five star review

02:45.460 --> 02:48.060
on the podcast app of your choice.

02:48.060 --> 02:52.340
Screenshot them aromatic and intimate words,

02:52.340 --> 02:56.740
and pass it along to your vibratin' Wolf the dog.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.260
But Wolf, how am I supposed to know

02:59.260 --> 03:03.540
where to find the 34 bonus episodes on Patreon,

03:03.540 --> 03:06.820
or the grace drippin' swag in the merch store,

03:06.820 --> 03:09.900
or the rowdy conversations in the Discord,

03:09.900 --> 03:13.180
or the comments from Luke in the subreddit,

03:13.180 --> 03:17.140
or the songs from Wave's soundtrack on YouTube,

03:17.140 --> 03:20.860
or the download for R.I. Peter's Cruisin'.

03:20.860 --> 03:24.060
Now listen, you, and listen good.

03:24.060 --> 03:26.140
Say it with me, everyone.

03:26.140 --> 03:29.980
The links are in the show notes.

03:29.980 --> 03:33.260
And now, it's time for two quick announcements

03:33.260 --> 03:36.900
from my producer, who scrawled this on my mirror

03:36.900 --> 03:39.860
and waited under the sink until I found it.

03:39.860 --> 03:43.620
No spoilies, but this is the final episode

03:43.620 --> 03:47.820
of the four part prequel art, The Death of a Salesman.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.940
Pretending to be people will be back in two weeks,

03:50.940 --> 03:52.860
on October 7th.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.980
Bloodily pickin' back up where they left off,

03:55.980 --> 03:57.980
in Grover's gorge.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.260
And for those of you blessed listeners

04:00.260 --> 04:04.860
who support us on Patreon and await new bonus episodes,

04:04.860 --> 04:09.300
we will have two new episodes for you in the comin' weeks.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.500
The first is a Luke run game with our dear bud Jake,

04:14.340 --> 04:17.660
joinin' to play the one page RPG, Witness Me,

04:17.660 --> 04:20.460
based on Mad Max Fury Road.

04:20.460 --> 04:24.460
And the second is a Zac run game of subway runners,

04:24.460 --> 04:28.540
a forged in the dark game where a rainbow haired gang

04:28.540 --> 04:31.900
went to repair subway lines under the city.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.860
Oh, and it's set in a cyberpunk future

04:34.860 --> 04:37.660
where everyone is immortal.

04:37.660 --> 04:40.460
Speaking of, they had so much fun with it

04:40.540 --> 04:44.220
that Zac is runnin' part two of that subway runners game

04:44.220 --> 04:49.220
live in the Dennison this comin' Tuesday at 7.37 p.m.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.140
Central time.

04:52.140 --> 04:56.020
All right, that's enough announcements.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.900
Gimme the news.

04:58.740 --> 05:01.540
Actually, the boys do a pretty decent recap

05:01.540 --> 05:03.340
at the beginnin' of this one.

05:03.340 --> 05:08.220
So for its final bow, put your hands and cheeks together

05:08.260 --> 05:10.900
for R.I. Peter with Cruisin'.

05:10.900 --> 05:11.740
Cruisin'.

05:40.900 --> 05:45.900
My archetype, I know this isn't right,

05:57.460 --> 05:58.780
but I'm a beefy boy.

06:01.780 --> 06:04.940
It's somethin' very similar to that, but you know.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.660
It's a beefcake.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.580
Also, every time we do, beefcake, there we go.

06:09.580 --> 06:12.780
Every time we do the 30 seconds of silence,

06:12.780 --> 06:15.460
you know, in a horror movie where they're trying

06:15.460 --> 06:18.700
not to breathe hard so that the killer doesn't find him,

06:18.700 --> 06:20.260
that's exactly how I feel.

06:21.780 --> 06:25.580
I saw that you put both hands over your mouth and nose.

06:25.580 --> 06:26.420
You can breathe.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.460
I was crying. Eyes wide.

06:27.460 --> 06:28.300
I start crying.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.380
Dude, you can breathe.

06:29.380 --> 06:31.180
Just lean back from the microphone.

06:31.180 --> 06:33.780
No one said hold your breath for 30 seconds.

06:33.780 --> 06:35.980
It's hard to do.

06:35.980 --> 06:37.980
Wait, let's see how old we can hold our breath.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.820
I think you can hold your breath.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.260
I'm not gonna try, but you guys get it.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.100
Oh, right.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.420
I didn't even start trying.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.260
I'm not.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.460
There's nothing better for a podcast.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.420
Yeah, I think we're onto something.

06:56.420 --> 06:59.980
Oh, Luke won, if he was ever playing.

06:59.980 --> 07:01.020
You look like you won.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.220
I was playing, but then I wasn't counting,

07:03.220 --> 07:05.180
and I was like, I don't wanna do this.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.060
I'm glad you didn't waste time counting

07:08.060 --> 07:10.980
because I would have never accepted your count.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.180
It was 69.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.020
Oh, nice.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.540
So, I know we literally just stopped recording

07:16.540 --> 07:20.220
the last episode and we're recording the second episode now.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.620
It's nine weeks later.

07:21.620 --> 07:22.460
Sure.

07:22.460 --> 07:23.980
So we know what's going on.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.660
For the audience who may have skipped,

07:26.660 --> 07:28.180
just forgot to listen to this episode,

07:28.180 --> 07:30.740
and be like, what did happen in that last episode?

07:30.740 --> 07:32.100
Yeah, in your own words,

07:32.140 --> 07:35.260
I'm curious to hear what's happened so far.

07:35.260 --> 07:39.220
Well, so far, you wanna recap of the whole pink-a-boo?

07:39.220 --> 07:40.420
No, just where we're at.

07:41.780 --> 07:46.500
Our doctor, Dr. Shark, got eaten by Quicksand and died.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.700
Well, no, no, no.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.620
Whose body do we have?

07:48.620 --> 07:49.460
We have Dr. Shark's body.

07:49.460 --> 07:52.660
No, you left Dr. Shark's body in the pool of water.

07:52.660 --> 07:53.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.340
But we took it from the Quicksand.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.380
We're weakened at Bernie's zine, Dr. Shark.

07:57.380 --> 07:58.780
Yep, you did that for a while.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.820
And then we replaced Dr. Shark with a...

08:02.380 --> 08:03.420
With a doctor from the neckbeards.

08:03.420 --> 08:06.580
That's right, whose captain died.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.300
His captain did die, Captain Neckbeard.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.920
Yeah, and you changed his name.

08:10.920 --> 08:11.760
We did?

08:11.760 --> 08:12.580
Yeah.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.660
His name wasn't Captain Neckbeard,

08:13.660 --> 08:14.500
or we changed the doctor's name.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.940
No, no, no, the doctor, you changed his name.

08:15.940 --> 08:18.140
You asked him what his name was, I think he told you,

08:18.140 --> 08:19.800
and then he changed it.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.640
To what, do you remember?

08:20.640 --> 08:22.500
So you're more than welcome to change it again,

08:22.500 --> 08:23.340
obviously.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.180
Yay.

08:24.180 --> 08:28.700
I think he talked like this.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.140
Yeah, he was scared, for sure.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.520
He was a bit scared, and he talked like this.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.500
Once we put him on board, we started calling him

08:34.500 --> 08:37.880
Dr. Pisspants, because he pissed his pants in fear.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.300
Dr. Pisspants.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.140
Dr. Pisspants.

08:40.140 --> 08:40.960
All right.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.800
I think that's what it was.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.080
And then we got on our ship, right?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.920
You headed back out to start the race.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.740
Oh, we stole Neckbeard's ship.

08:48.740 --> 08:49.580
You stole Neckbeard's ship.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.640
I think we just told their crew, like,

08:51.640 --> 08:53.380
hey, you're with us now, right?

08:53.380 --> 08:54.460
And you sent the...

08:54.460 --> 08:56.660
Jesus H., Jesus Christ, and...

08:56.660 --> 08:58.500
Yeah, we sent one of your golden...

08:58.500 --> 08:59.320
Mrs. Knife.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
And Mrs. Knife.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.560
We sent my Emperor Tamarin monkey, Jesus Christ,

09:03.560 --> 09:06.800
along with Dr. Shark's parrot.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.640
That's the one.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.460
Mrs. Knife.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.300
Uh-huh.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.120
Mrs. Knife.

09:10.120 --> 09:10.960
To go run the ship.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.840
And the mother of Mitch to recite the all-important word.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.760
Mrs. Diggory is on her way there to recite the ship.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.720
And then who do we have?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.240
We have our cool friend we made.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.540
Zach, pause, pause, pause.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.380
Yeah, what's up?

09:21.380 --> 09:24.160
Are you writing fucking Harry Potter fan fiction

09:24.160 --> 09:25.200
this whole season?

09:25.200 --> 09:27.840
Like, is that what you call the Diggory,

09:27.880 --> 09:30.720
so this can all kind of fit canon into your, like,

09:30.720 --> 09:33.380
wait till you meet Umbridge.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.540
I take her with that.

09:43.860 --> 09:44.720
Nice.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.040
Okay, Mitch is the guy that we have.

09:47.040 --> 09:47.880
Yeah.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, Mitch is on the back of the ship alongside.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.360
Oh, yeah, Edward Spitz, the cold-blooded butler.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.720
He's not really a butler,

09:57.720 --> 09:59.080
but he likes to think of himself like that.

09:59.080 --> 09:59.920
Yeah.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.640
That's my pulp Cthulhu occupation.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.480
I love that.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.520
And Joe, you're playing?

10:06.520 --> 10:08.040
Waverly.

10:08.040 --> 10:08.880
That's right.

10:08.880 --> 10:09.960
They call me Wavy.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.000
Wavy Adler.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.940
Wavy Adler, and he kind of has taken the charge

10:14.940 --> 10:18.080
of, like, steering the ship in what is looking

10:18.080 --> 10:21.900
to be some sort of eldritch ritual race.

10:24.500 --> 10:25.340
Yep.

10:26.180 --> 10:28.500
And we have to, we're pouring oil?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.180
No, we're pouring blood, baby.

10:30.180 --> 10:33.660
We're pouring blood out of the back in a big circle.

10:33.660 --> 10:35.120
Okay, yeah, that's right.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.720
That was kind of the reveal at the very end.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.740
My very single last note is that the barrel

10:40.740 --> 10:44.020
started gushing blood, and Mitch quote-unquote begins.

10:51.020 --> 10:52.780
And he continues to chant.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.980
I got a solicitor today who was saying

10:54.980 --> 10:55.820
that to me on the phone.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.700
Yeah, I was just about to say that sounds exactly

10:57.700 --> 10:58.540
like the phone call.

10:58.540 --> 11:00.100
Making a call, Joe, yeah.

11:00.100 --> 11:00.940
Wow.

11:02.260 --> 11:03.720
Do you want to explain that?

11:03.720 --> 11:07.000
I got a call, Zach was setting up,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.620
and he told us all to take off our headphones,

11:08.620 --> 11:10.180
and as he told us that, I got a phone call

11:10.180 --> 11:11.860
from my internet service,

11:11.860 --> 11:13.220
because I had just recently disconnected,

11:13.220 --> 11:14.460
and they wanted to give me a survey.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.940
But as soon as I answered the phone,

11:16.940 --> 11:18.700
he played that sound.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.620
So loud.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.660
And he played so loud out of the headphones.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.020
And I looked at Joe like eyes wide open.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.900
It was disorienting for everyone,

11:27.900 --> 11:30.540
because we thought my phone was making that noise.

11:30.540 --> 11:34.300
I watched you three idiots grapple with that.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.860
I kind of got it right away.

11:35.860 --> 11:36.700
Yeah, that's right.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.820
I played it, and I was still like,

11:37.820 --> 11:39.560
what the fuck, Joe?

11:41.300 --> 11:43.660
To be fair, I was not sitting on the couch

11:43.660 --> 11:45.520
with your phone, and it was blasting super loud

11:45.520 --> 11:48.300
out of my own headphones, so I might have had

11:48.300 --> 11:50.220
some more context clues for it.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.420
Yeah, I was right here, and I was watching it

11:53.060 --> 11:54.540
come out of your phone, and I was like,

11:54.540 --> 11:56.100
hang up, Joe, hang up.

11:56.100 --> 11:56.940
Hang up.

11:59.940 --> 12:01.740
Like, don't keep letting that play.

12:04.180 --> 12:07.100
So you hear that echoing from the back of this ship.

12:07.100 --> 12:11.380
As the race begins, the smoke in the center

12:11.380 --> 12:15.700
of the island turned from dark to white,

12:15.700 --> 12:17.860
and the race began.

12:17.860 --> 12:21.560
As the race began, you noticed the closest ship

12:21.560 --> 12:25.960
to the shore of the island, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy,

12:25.960 --> 12:29.200
took off at a wild rate.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.120
They rolled a critical success on their sailing,

12:32.120 --> 12:37.120
and they literally shoot ahead, basically completing

12:37.200 --> 12:42.120
one third of the entire circle around the island

12:42.120 --> 12:43.760
in this first push.

12:43.760 --> 12:48.760
Also, in the same round, they succeeded on taking out

12:49.080 --> 12:54.080
one of the masts on the Swing Sing Brothers two mast ship.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.440
Now, they were the ones with the best guns.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.520
Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy indeed are the ones

12:59.520 --> 13:01.800
with the best guns, that is correct.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.920
Where are the swing boys?

13:03.920 --> 13:08.040
Next, closest to you would be the Swing Sing Brothers

13:08.040 --> 13:11.160
from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damcy, who's the furthest away.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.240
The Swing Sing Brothers are next up.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.560
You saw one of their giant pillars of wood

13:17.600 --> 13:21.680
that holds up the bedsheets that make ships go fast.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.960
That whole shit fell into the water.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.720
That is a fun fact, they do just use bedsheets.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.880
I just assumed, I've never seen cloth so big besides that.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.320
Yeah, hey.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.960
They haven't invented parachutes yet, have they?

13:36.960 --> 13:38.780
Big sailing ship is gonna tell you

13:38.780 --> 13:41.480
that they're not just bedsheets, but buddy, they are.

13:42.400 --> 13:47.400
The crew that you have sort of taken under your wing

13:47.600 --> 13:52.480
and as your second ship in this race could not get moving.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.960
And you notice that they actually messed up their cannons,

13:55.960 --> 13:59.320
they fell over, their cannons are not operational

13:59.320 --> 14:01.080
and they were not able to move forward.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.240
The group next to you, the Port Deserters,

14:03.240 --> 14:06.840
these are the Union Jack flag with the bottle

14:06.840 --> 14:10.520
sewn into the middle of it, triple X across the bottle.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.180
I would remind my fellow pirates

14:12.180 --> 14:15.240
that they were seen drinking heavily before the race.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.200
Yes, and you took advantage of that.

14:18.200 --> 14:23.200
And I do believe that Alabaster Al Chernabog,

14:23.560 --> 14:25.120
we talked about the other two characters,

14:25.120 --> 14:27.080
but we didn't talk about Alabaster Al.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.880
What is he like when he's running these guns

14:29.880 --> 14:34.880
that you laid off to just lay absolute blows

14:36.440 --> 14:38.760
to this massive ship of the Port Deserters?

14:38.760 --> 14:40.960
You see that it doesn't all get through

14:40.960 --> 14:43.440
their extremely sturdy, girthy ship,

14:43.440 --> 14:46.440
but enough of it does because of you.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.600
You know, the ship isn't the longest, but.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.600
This might start out a little rough, but here we go.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.160
The way that, oh, it's gonna start out real.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.360
No, it's nice, it's nice.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.640
The way that he likes to run the ship,

15:00.640 --> 15:03.960
he's very excited the whole time that he's doing it.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.520
He cannot wait to fire that next round

15:07.520 --> 15:09.060
until they've won the game.

15:09.060 --> 15:14.060
So he excitedly has told them to fire off the shots

15:15.080 --> 15:17.840
and he got so excited he forgot to tell

15:17.840 --> 15:19.720
the rest of the crew to start reloading

15:19.720 --> 15:22.280
because he just went and started reloading them.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.880
But they see, they're paying attention.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.100
What does it sound like when,

15:25.100 --> 15:26.920
and you lead by example clearly,

15:26.920 --> 15:29.560
so what does it sound like as you lead by example

15:29.560 --> 15:31.120
remembering in that moment,

15:31.120 --> 15:32.600
oh shit, I have to tell the crew?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.440
Oi!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.440
They all immediately look over.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.680
Well, that's the code word that we have set up

15:38.680 --> 15:39.980
that means reload, just.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.120
Oi! Oi!

15:43.120 --> 15:46.760
And bombs away, you were able to knock a fair amount

15:46.760 --> 15:51.000
of damage onto and off of that poor deserter's ship.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.240
And off we go to the top of round two.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.680
We're gonna start with Joe as the rope man

15:57.680 --> 16:00.760
and the wheel man for this large ship,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.840
the death of a salesman.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.440
Death of a salesman.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.600
Do you want me to roll?

16:05.640 --> 16:07.280
I would love for you to roll.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.680
Just doing my ship driving?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.080
Yeah, we're all gonna, I'm gonna roll too.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.000
What's a sail?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.720
Like when they have a discount.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.600
Oh my God.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.160
So that's a fail, it's an 80 on a 70,

16:18.160 --> 16:20.520
but I'm gonna use one of my three luck.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.040
Ooh, very smart man.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.780
It's only so smart because it only makes it an eight,

16:25.780 --> 16:28.080
which isn't great if I'm in a competition,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.240
but it's still a success either way.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.640
Fantastic, so that is a success.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.600
The port deserters actually rolled a critical fail

16:35.600 --> 16:38.840
and yet they were able to use a bonus dice to avoid that,

16:38.840 --> 16:41.520
but they rolled a 98 instead of an 88,

16:41.520 --> 16:43.960
which is still a failure.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.680
The neckbeard ship finally takes off

16:46.680 --> 16:50.120
into the waters ahead of itself

16:50.120 --> 16:52.600
as the Swing Sing brothers do the same.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.720
Up in the lead, you see far in the distance

16:55.720 --> 16:58.560
away from your ship, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damned Sea,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.880
once again succeeds and continues

17:01.880 --> 17:04.140
towards the end of this circle.

17:04.140 --> 17:08.400
They're almost out of your view at this point.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.240
Yikes.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.360
Are we not moving at all?

17:10.360 --> 17:12.600
I can tell you cause it'll give you a good idea

17:12.600 --> 17:14.020
of how fucked you are.

17:14.020 --> 17:18.840
You have made it 20%, they have made it 50%.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.680
Shit.

17:19.680 --> 17:20.500
Wow.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.340
Yeah.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.220
But that's with like two crits in a row.

17:22.220 --> 17:23.440
Crit and then a success,

17:23.440 --> 17:25.740
but they started much closer to the shore than you,

17:25.740 --> 17:27.520
so they're gonna be able to complete their circle

17:27.520 --> 17:28.600
much sooner.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.320
I thought the slowest ship was on the inside

17:30.320 --> 17:31.480
and the fastest ship was on the outside.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.200
The slowest ship is on the inside,

17:33.200 --> 17:34.840
they just crit it and succeeded.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.080
I don't think we need to worry about this

17:36.080 --> 17:36.920
that much right now.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.180
And so like distance wise,

17:38.180 --> 17:39.800
you said we can barely see them.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.240
Yeah, you can barely see them,

17:41.240 --> 17:43.880
but just through the distance there,

17:43.880 --> 17:47.800
you see that they absolutely wreck shop

17:47.800 --> 17:49.880
on the Swing Sing brothers.

17:49.880 --> 17:50.900
Oh shit.

17:50.900 --> 17:54.280
Just, oh shit, move it till it's,

17:54.280 --> 17:56.920
oh girl, light it up and let me see y'all.

17:56.920 --> 17:57.760
Swing.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.200
Ship swing.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.920
And the Swing Sing brothers ship is moving forward

18:03.920 --> 18:06.560
in space, obviously.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.880
We're in space now?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.160
Hell yeah, dude.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.960
In between you and the Swing Sing brothers

18:12.960 --> 18:15.960
is the neck beard ship.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.080
And that's what they're all saying.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.280
As the Swing Sing brothers ship moves forward,

18:20.280 --> 18:24.360
you see it disappear behind neck beard ship.

18:24.360 --> 18:28.640
And then when it passes through on the other side,

18:28.640 --> 18:31.200
you see that it is basically emaciated.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.360
It is the skeleton of a ship.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.720
It has been absolutely ripped apart by cannons

18:37.720 --> 18:40.640
and those wire things with the balls,

18:40.640 --> 18:41.800
connecting with the wire,

18:41.800 --> 18:43.640
just like taking out everyone.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.480
Chain shot.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.320
Benoit balls.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.480
It's called chain shot.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.760
Benoit balls, I'm pretty sure.

18:48.760 --> 18:49.600
Also not to pile on,

18:49.600 --> 18:51.760
but that's not what emaciated means.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.600
Emaciated means.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.160
Would be like very skinny.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.000
Yeah, they're all really hungry.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.060
Be hungry and starved.

18:56.060 --> 18:56.900
Yeah.

18:56.900 --> 18:57.720
That ship looks so hungry.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.320
I would say this has been hacked to bits.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.200
Yeah, like to the points where you can see its ribs.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.440
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.640
I'm gonna stick with it.

19:11.640 --> 19:16.640
This emaciated ship crawls across the ocean.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.480
Ship Akimbo passed the other ship in the distance.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.940
That was something I saw on the Discord.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.480
You don't actually use Akimbo wrong.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.400
People just didn't know how it could be used.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.380
Fuck yeah.

19:29.380 --> 19:30.760
Thanks for sticking up for me now.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.080
Jesus.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.840
Oh yeah, you mean where thousands of people will hear it

19:34.840 --> 19:37.640
instead of like the two dozen on the spoilers chat?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.900
The Sweeting Brothers.

19:39.900 --> 19:40.740
They're dunzo beans.

19:40.740 --> 19:41.560
They're dunzoed?

19:41.560 --> 19:43.940
Absolutely dunzo beans.

19:43.940 --> 19:48.100
And with that, we move on to the gunning phase

19:48.100 --> 19:49.240
for Death of a Salesman.

19:49.240 --> 19:52.240
You have one ship within your sights.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.640
It is the Port Deserters.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.460
The Port Deserters were the fast guys

19:55.460 --> 19:56.660
that we were worried about.

19:56.660 --> 19:59.300
And they failed their second check, yeah.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.460
You are ahead of them.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.220
Then yeah, we've reloaded.

20:03.220 --> 20:04.060
We've reloaded.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.660
And oi oi!

20:09.660 --> 20:10.820
That means reload.

20:10.820 --> 20:12.340
No, oi means reload.

20:12.340 --> 20:14.180
Oi oi means fire.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.100
Go ahead and roll.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.340
A third of the crew is confused

20:20.340 --> 20:22.300
and just start packing more rounds in.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.660
Two round shot.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.540
You're not a confederate.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.380
You did that again.

20:26.380 --> 20:27.200
That's a goner.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.040
Oh, there it is.

20:28.040 --> 20:28.880
That's a goner.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.940
It felt like it went down in the catch.

20:29.940 --> 20:33.180
It's a 42 on 80.

20:33.180 --> 20:34.020
Yeah, that'll do it.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.720
Go ahead and roll a D4 and a D8.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.300
We've got a two on the D4.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.400
A two and a five.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.540
And a five on the D8.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.700
Makes for seven points of damage.

20:44.700 --> 20:48.220
Again, you do a little bit more damage this time

20:48.220 --> 20:50.160
than you did last time to the Port Deserters.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.500
And they have finally noticed.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.620
Oh, okay.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.820
You hit them hard enough on this one

20:57.820 --> 21:00.180
to where some heads are actually popping up

21:00.180 --> 21:02.480
on the top deck.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.320
And they're looking about.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.960
What if their heads were popping off?

21:04.960 --> 21:07.900
Oh yeah, actually you see one guy in the back

21:07.900 --> 21:09.600
whose head pops out just in time

21:09.600 --> 21:13.100
as that last cannon ball just heads him off.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.020
You fucking patriot.

21:15.020 --> 21:17.100
He gets absolutely

21:17.100 --> 21:17.940
patriotic.

21:20.140 --> 21:21.020
That seems rad.

21:21.060 --> 21:22.780
I had not seen that movie in years.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.200
I forgot that fucking Mel Gibson is the head

21:25.200 --> 21:28.700
of a family of benevolent slave owners.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.060
Yeah.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.140
I did not, yeah.

21:32.140 --> 21:34.660
And it's like, it's weird.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.260
It's patriotic as hell as well.

21:36.260 --> 21:37.840
It is, it is, yeah.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.860
It's very American.

21:38.860 --> 21:41.080
It's just such a choice.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.260
Could have easily.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.220
Dude, that guy makes a lot of those, huh?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.500
Been from Boston.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.780
I watched that in third grade.

21:47.780 --> 21:48.820
Didn't pick up on that.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.360
Did pick up on the hatchet that goes

21:50.640 --> 21:51.480
to the guy's skull.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.320
That's stuck with me ever since.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.520
Yeah, that part's rad.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.480
The guy getting fucking his head blown off

21:55.480 --> 21:56.320
by the cannon.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.800
Not blown off, just like flick.

21:57.800 --> 22:02.220
Yeah, as if God's, as if God's finger came down.

22:02.220 --> 22:07.220
Luke, oh, Alabaster Alshernabog's cannon

22:07.680 --> 22:09.920
flicks this man's head off.

22:09.920 --> 22:10.760
And then.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.600
Patriot style.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.320
The, over the intercom of this.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.300
His head is emancipated from his body.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.540
Team Slayer.

22:20.540 --> 22:25.180
Thomas, next to you, Mitch Diggory is continuing

22:25.180 --> 22:30.180
with his Er-wah-doh-nyeh-nyeh.

22:30.940 --> 22:32.700
I used to think, made out like his words

22:32.700 --> 22:35.740
were complicated, but it's just a fucking Little John song.

22:37.980 --> 22:38.820
What?

22:38.820 --> 22:39.780
Thank you, Joe.

22:39.780 --> 22:41.780
I thought you said Elton John.

22:41.780 --> 22:42.620
And then he's like.

22:42.620 --> 22:43.460
And I was.

22:43.460 --> 22:44.660
You were like racking your brain.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.980
I was trying so hard.

22:45.980 --> 22:48.340
I'm like, it doesn't make any sense to me.

22:50.100 --> 22:50.940
What?

22:53.860 --> 22:55.700
Got the headlights on the.

22:55.700 --> 22:56.540
What?

22:58.380 --> 22:59.740
That's hard on the throat.

23:01.220 --> 23:03.520
Yeah, so Edward just imagines it's like,

23:03.520 --> 23:05.820
he's rapidly like thinking, what is the point of Mitch?

23:05.820 --> 23:06.800
I could do this.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.980
All them swinging bastards.

23:10.980 --> 23:12.740
I got a ship all eat up.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.340
It's emaciated.

23:15.980 --> 23:16.820
Yeah.

23:19.380 --> 23:20.700
Emaciated.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.160
You're saying they're hungry?

23:22.160 --> 23:24.680
No, all I'm trying to say is gone mostly.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.780
Most of their ship is just gone.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.140
Para-mancy on the damn sea, they show them all the shit.

23:30.140 --> 23:31.720
There's none left.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.540
None left was blenders anyway.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.940
And then there were three.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.700
They're out there dying in the water.

23:38.700 --> 23:42.300
Look at the bastards drowning and feeding the sharks.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.580
Boy, they're dunzo beans.

23:46.140 --> 23:47.600
Reload, but fuck.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.280
By dunzo beans, do you mean dunion rings?

23:54.980 --> 23:56.820
It's exactly what I mean.

23:56.820 --> 23:58.940
I thought so, because I made that playlist

23:58.940 --> 24:01.700
after my last breakup and sent it to you.

24:01.700 --> 24:06.700
In an attempt to be done with your ring around this island,

24:07.900 --> 24:12.900
I need a roll for sailing from Sir Wavy Adler.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.380
Can I use rope to help him?

24:15.380 --> 24:18.340
You would not be able to fire if you use rope to help him.

24:18.340 --> 24:19.180
I don't want to help him.

24:19.180 --> 24:20.940
And what are sails?

24:20.940 --> 24:23.860
I believe they are the fitted sheet specifically

24:23.860 --> 24:26.420
so that it attaches easier to the mast,

24:26.420 --> 24:29.100
which I learned in my head recently is the wood part.

24:29.100 --> 24:29.940
Mask.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.860
I got a seven.

24:32.860 --> 24:33.700
You got a what?

24:33.700 --> 24:34.520
Seven.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.360
Oh, that is a success.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.220
Yes, I believe that is a success.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.140
I successfully did sailing.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.020
You push even further than the port deserters

24:42.060 --> 24:45.140
who, while lively, seem to be more concerned

24:45.140 --> 24:47.060
about the damage you've done to their ship

24:47.060 --> 24:52.000
than actually moving forward in any measurable way.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.340
The neckbeards, however, do succeed and move forward.

24:55.340 --> 24:58.220
They're actually about even with you now.

24:58.220 --> 25:01.300
And you see that you are both catching up,

25:01.300 --> 25:03.260
slowly but certainly surely,

25:03.260 --> 25:05.380
to fancy pyromancy on the damn sea.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.620
Attagah, way to go, boys.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.660
We're catching on them.

25:08.660 --> 25:09.500
But then.

25:10.340 --> 25:11.180
Oh!

25:12.380 --> 25:16.060
Through the side of the neckbeard ship,

25:16.060 --> 25:20.340
you see a cannonball four times bigger

25:20.340 --> 25:24.260
than you've seen on any ship you've been on

25:24.260 --> 25:28.020
bust through your side of neckbeard ship.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.860
So it's across from you in the water

25:30.860 --> 25:34.420
and you just see that, and as it hits the water,

25:34.420 --> 25:36.740
it splashes you.

25:36.740 --> 25:40.500
They are desperately trying to patch the hole

25:40.500 --> 25:43.420
as water is lapping up inside.

25:43.420 --> 25:45.220
Can we see where that shot came from?

25:45.220 --> 25:46.060
Was it the pyromancy?

25:46.060 --> 25:46.900
It was the pyromancy, right.

25:46.900 --> 25:47.780
Or did it come from the island?

25:47.780 --> 25:50.340
You can certainly roll.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.340
Can I do a spot hidden?

25:51.340 --> 25:53.220
Yeah, we can call that spot hidden.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.500
30 on an 80.

25:55.980 --> 25:59.540
92 on a 70, but I've got that skill

25:59.540 --> 26:01.220
that I can reroll the one thing.

26:01.220 --> 26:02.040
Oh, 22!

26:02.040 --> 26:02.880
Hell yeah.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.380
That's a critical success.

26:04.420 --> 26:07.180
Through the hole in the side of the ship,

26:07.180 --> 26:08.340
you hold up.

26:08.340 --> 26:10.060
My spyglass, yep.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.780
And as you lengthen it out, you see,

26:13.780 --> 26:16.980
through this hole.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.060
And this burning blood from the guy

26:19.060 --> 26:20.900
who got patrioted inside the ship.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.420
Yeah.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.780
Yeah, and you see a pair of legs walking around

26:26.780 --> 26:29.880
without a top half, a walk past,

26:29.880 --> 26:31.820
but just through the view,

26:31.860 --> 26:35.460
you can make out the ship of fancy pyromancy

26:35.460 --> 26:39.460
on the damn sea with its smoking, massive cannon

26:39.460 --> 26:40.700
that they've dragged out.

26:40.700 --> 26:44.260
They didn't even try to move forward this round.

26:44.260 --> 26:46.840
No one was manning the sails.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.020
They just dragged out this massive cannon

26:49.020 --> 26:50.100
to take this shot.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.620
They got the mother of all cannons

26:51.620 --> 26:53.440
on that ship over there, boys!

26:53.440 --> 26:55.480
Hey, Sheridu, but half the reason

26:55.480 --> 26:59.020
we got them neckbeards is to be our sacrificial goat.

26:59.020 --> 27:00.840
I say let them take that shot.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.740
To distract the pyromancy,

27:03.740 --> 27:06.540
we put everything we got next time into moving forward.

27:06.540 --> 27:09.340
Well, let's keep their husk of a ship

27:09.340 --> 27:11.540
between us and them as long as we can.

27:11.540 --> 27:14.460
I pull out a whistle and blow on it,

27:14.460 --> 27:16.500
and I know this isn't how monkeys hear,

27:16.500 --> 27:19.480
but you don't hear any sounds coming out of the whistle.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.120
It's my monkey whistle.

27:23.120 --> 27:23.960
Exactly.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.620
Oh, we didn't send, oh, sorry.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.180
No, you wouldn't say, oh, sorry,

27:30.180 --> 27:31.460
because you can't hear it.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.960
Right, exactly, no, I didn't even.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.180
I thought that was the introduction

27:36.180 --> 27:38.000
of some new, mysterious, creepy sound effect.

27:38.000 --> 27:38.920
What I was gonna say is,

27:38.920 --> 27:41.180
I think we sent your Emperor Tamarind over,

27:41.180 --> 27:44.580
but we had the, Mrs. Knife was gonna be the runner

27:44.580 --> 27:45.660
between the ships, right?

27:45.660 --> 27:47.220
Yes, yes, yes.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.900
So that is a pretty good time

27:48.900 --> 27:52.820
after we've decided to cut them off and move on.

27:52.820 --> 27:55.980
I relay that to Mrs. Shark, who says.

27:55.980 --> 27:57.500
Cut it off.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.460
Moving on.

28:00.180 --> 28:04.380
I didn't have a sick segue that time,

28:04.380 --> 28:06.180
but I need another navigation roll.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.740
And then is this where we could help?

28:09.740 --> 28:11.540
Yeah, if you guys wanna take off

28:11.540 --> 28:13.780
from firing at the port deserters,

28:13.780 --> 28:16.100
then you can all really get in on pushing this ship forward.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.940
I have something that I wanna do

28:18.940 --> 28:20.980
to avoid being shot by that thing.

28:20.980 --> 28:24.460
So let me ask you this before I waste time doing it.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.020
You know how I like to mix chemicals and shit together?

28:29.020 --> 28:30.820
You do know how you like to mix chemicals.

28:30.820 --> 28:31.660
Does your character also do that?

28:31.660 --> 28:33.260
Your character does that too, I think, yeah.

28:33.260 --> 28:34.700
They say right what you know.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.400
For the listeners, Luke is not a scientist.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.620
I have a minor in biology.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.460
Whoa, I didn't know that.

28:44.460 --> 28:45.580
So you know what?

28:45.580 --> 28:46.540
You're right.

28:48.780 --> 28:49.680
Okay, so.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.940
If you're a biologist, then what's wrong with me?

28:51.940 --> 28:53.420
Oh, Joe just pulled down his pants.

28:53.420 --> 28:55.300
Oh my God, there is.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.340
There's too much of ya.

28:56.340 --> 28:57.180
Look at that.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.860
Oh, cool, there's way too much of ya.

28:59.700 --> 29:00.820
Your blood's not flowing correctly.

29:00.820 --> 29:04.460
If we were up in the Northeast, I'd call that a hoagie.

29:06.300 --> 29:07.940
Here we call it a sub, I guess.

29:08.780 --> 29:09.740
Are you a sub, Joe?

29:10.740 --> 29:11.860
The people wanna know.

29:11.860 --> 29:14.780
Hold on, real quick, I just need to let one lie

29:14.780 --> 29:16.580
that went unaddressed be addressed.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.620
When Luke says he has a minor in biology,

29:18.620 --> 29:21.020
what he means is he fathered a child when he was 15

29:21.020 --> 29:25.140
and that child themselves is now a freshman in high school

29:25.140 --> 29:27.180
in Mrs. Atkinson's biology class.

29:27.180 --> 29:32.180
I was definitely a virgin then, so you're wrong.

29:33.860 --> 29:35.380
Speaking of.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.340
Oh my God.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.080
I've got very bad news, fellas.

29:38.080 --> 29:38.920
Uh-oh.

29:38.920 --> 29:39.860
It's at 88.

29:39.860 --> 29:41.540
Can you re-roll one of them?

29:41.540 --> 29:44.100
It's a dang old crit fail and no, Zach, I can't re-roll it.

29:44.100 --> 29:44.940
That re-roll thing is going on.

29:44.940 --> 29:46.500
And no, Zach, I don't wanna talk about it.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.340
And no, Zach, I don't want any consequences.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.900
I don't wanna talk about it right now.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.820
And yet, as your hands are trembling,

29:53.860 --> 29:55.520
unable to complete this task,

29:55.520 --> 29:58.900
was Mr. Spitz able to save the day here?

30:00.280 --> 30:01.980
With a sailing roll?

30:01.980 --> 30:04.540
No, I didn't roll anything good.

30:04.540 --> 30:09.540
Okay, is this a time where I could see

30:12.060 --> 30:16.380
that things are going very wrong and now help?

30:16.380 --> 30:19.100
Oh, I mean, I suppose.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.180
Didn't you already roll?

30:20.180 --> 30:21.020
He had not rolled yet.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.580
No, I was not gonna help

30:22.580 --> 30:23.980
because I had my own thing I was gonna do.

30:23.980 --> 30:27.140
But now, this seems a whole lot more relevant

30:27.140 --> 30:28.340
than what I was gonna do.

30:28.340 --> 30:29.180
Good play.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.740
What should I, anyway, I try to-

30:31.740 --> 30:32.780
You have luck, man.

30:32.780 --> 30:33.620
That's true.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.440
What did you roll?

30:34.440 --> 30:35.280
He rolled a 68.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.700
I rolled a 68, which-

30:36.700 --> 30:37.980
86 ain't gonna do it.

30:37.980 --> 30:41.520
So, one luck won't work.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.180
Okay, then I don't-

30:43.180 --> 30:44.620
Do you spend the luck anyway?

30:44.620 --> 30:46.740
I don't, I don't do that.

30:46.740 --> 30:48.180
Make it more of a fail.

30:48.540 --> 30:52.460
You wanted it to be, you know, more exciting.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.060
I see that everything's going wrong

30:56.060 --> 30:57.860
and I'm like, I don't think I can help.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.660
That's how that works, right?

31:02.660 --> 31:05.340
The port deserters are able to catch up a little bit.

31:05.340 --> 31:06.660
They're not past you yet,

31:06.660 --> 31:09.340
but they are catching up currently

31:09.340 --> 31:11.580
and we are rolling again.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.420
Joe, if I could get a rope use,

31:14.420 --> 31:16.620
are you guys going to help him again?

31:16.900 --> 31:18.100
What is the conversation happening

31:18.100 --> 31:21.380
as you guys are failing at this sailing task?

31:21.380 --> 31:23.500
Is the consequence of the crit fail

31:23.500 --> 31:25.960
that we just don't move and don't fire for a round?

31:25.960 --> 31:26.800
That is correct.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.400
Okay, so I was gonna say that Waverly's

31:28.400 --> 31:30.900
probably just in awe of that giant hole

31:30.900 --> 31:32.340
that has now been punctured.

31:32.340 --> 31:33.820
Like, that cannon scared him.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.300
So, he just stood there agape.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.100
Well, and honestly, I bet a lot of the crew is.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.900
So, while we're running around trying to whip them up,

31:40.900 --> 31:42.460
a lot of them are just like awestruck

31:42.460 --> 31:43.300
by what they've just seen.

31:43.700 --> 31:46.860
Yeah, I saw the giant hole being made

31:46.860 --> 31:49.620
and I was racking my brain for weapons on board

31:49.620 --> 31:52.060
that measure up to that at all and I couldn't.

31:52.060 --> 31:55.200
And then when I see that everybody's fucking up us moving,

31:55.200 --> 31:57.460
I kind of grab a rope and pull it,

31:57.460 --> 32:01.220
but I'm just staring at the hole in the hole.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.340
The hole in the hole.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.240
The hole in the hole.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.880
We didn't get much of anywhere this time,

32:05.880 --> 32:07.860
but the key to defeating that gun,

32:07.860 --> 32:11.060
eventually, if we need to, we'll be getting close to it.

32:11.060 --> 32:13.180
It can fire at us before we can fire at it.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.860
Not all four of that distance, right?

32:15.860 --> 32:17.060
I've got something whipped up

32:17.060 --> 32:18.380
that I think might be able to help.

32:18.380 --> 32:20.820
If Jesus Christ gets here soon

32:20.820 --> 32:24.620
or if I can run down to the bottom, I can grab it for us.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.980
It's a special powder that I've mixed together

32:26.980 --> 32:31.980
that I can put on a cannon ball and shoot into their cannon.

32:32.460 --> 32:35.880
Yeah, you told me your special powder would get herpes.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.720
Your special powder doesn't do shit.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.260
Lots of special powders.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.860
I gotta go look and see what I have down there.

32:39.860 --> 32:40.800
I'm making this shit up.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.380
I've got it all labeled.

32:42.380 --> 32:43.220
That's what I'm saying.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.140
I've got it all labeled down there.

32:45.140 --> 32:46.700
Let me go take a peek.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.760
Let me take a turn to take a peek.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.600
Take a turnip.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.380
He like pops a herpes sore at you in disgust.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.780
Oh, God.

32:53.780 --> 32:55.100
He's like, thank you, powder.

32:55.100 --> 32:55.920
Wow.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.940
We are pirates.

32:56.940 --> 32:58.860
We are disgusting.

32:58.860 --> 32:59.700
That's awful.

32:59.700 --> 33:00.900
That's truly awful.

33:00.900 --> 33:04.900
It goes into one of the three giant open sores on my face,

33:07.900 --> 33:10.420
which is depicted on my character sheet.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.260
Do you guys feel closer?

33:11.300 --> 33:14.340
People don't know about history is that before that moment,

33:14.340 --> 33:16.940
herpes was like totally curable, but that's great.

33:19.180 --> 33:23.260
This is the moment where the super strain was developed.

33:23.260 --> 33:25.500
And then eventually when I find that I have it,

33:25.500 --> 33:27.060
I blame it on the damn monkey.

33:27.060 --> 33:29.380
We're also both two weeks from dying from smallpox.

33:29.380 --> 33:32.460
So it's like, this is our last hurrah.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.100
Fancy pyromancy actually pushes forward

33:37.100 --> 33:39.180
to where you can no longer see them.

33:39.180 --> 33:42.720
They have turned the corner and they have disappeared

33:42.720 --> 33:44.220
around the other side of the island,

33:44.220 --> 33:46.180
which is thankful for the neckbeard ship

33:46.180 --> 33:49.560
because they weren't able to fire at them this round.

33:49.560 --> 33:54.540
However, the neckbeard ship failed miserably on their check

33:54.540 --> 33:58.060
to combat the drowning.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.260
What does a boat do?

33:59.260 --> 34:00.300
Sinks.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.140
Yep.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.420
And so this drowning boat.

34:05.180 --> 34:07.340
This boat is gasping for air.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.980
This emaciated boat is drowning.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.540
If I had to put it in terms of like math,

34:13.540 --> 34:16.060
I'd say they started at yay 20 or so

34:16.060 --> 34:18.780
and are down to three hit points on the ship.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.020
Not going well.

34:20.020 --> 34:23.540
And they critically failed and unable to help themselves

34:23.540 --> 34:25.860
with an additional set of crew members.

34:25.860 --> 34:30.100
They are actually moving backwards a little bit in space.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.040
From what we can tell,

34:31.040 --> 34:32.880
does it look like most of that damage

34:32.880 --> 34:33.980
came from that one shot?

34:33.980 --> 34:34.940
Oh yes.

34:34.940 --> 34:35.780
Okay.

34:35.780 --> 34:36.600
Horrifying.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.720
Truly, truly horrifying.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.440
And the port deserters are actually picking up steam now.

34:41.440 --> 34:45.800
They are now two successful sailing moves in a row

34:45.800 --> 34:49.280
and it is on you guys to catch up in this moment.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.440
That's a 37 on a 70.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.280
We're good.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.100
That'll do it.

34:54.100 --> 34:56.460
And you move up forward ahead of them again.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.900
You guys are inching ahead of each other at each time,

34:59.900 --> 35:02.760
just pushing nose to nose in this race.

35:02.760 --> 35:06.420
I wanna take this moment to call Mrs. Knife

35:07.180 --> 35:09.380
and while she's flying over, say to you guys,

35:09.380 --> 35:12.500
what do you think about evacuating some key personnel

35:12.500 --> 35:16.660
from the neckpits, including Mitch's mom and her barrel

35:16.660 --> 35:18.340
and you know, Jesus Christ.

35:19.260 --> 35:20.420
Getting them back on here.

35:20.420 --> 35:22.020
It looks like their boat's done for.

35:22.020 --> 35:26.300
We need Jesus and if they've got enough,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.900
I think the way we get Jesus over here,

35:29.900 --> 35:33.140
put as many men in those boats or however we do it.

35:33.220 --> 35:36.460
I was thinking the parrot could bring Jesus over here

35:36.460 --> 35:39.220
but do you think the parrot could bring over a human being?

35:39.220 --> 35:41.380
You know, so we've got little boats

35:41.380 --> 35:42.760
that go between the boats.

35:42.760 --> 35:43.600
Right.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.700
Can bring people over and monkeys, really.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.220
Right, that's what I said.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.700
I imagine that's how you,

35:48.700 --> 35:50.860
you said the parrot would carry them.

35:50.860 --> 35:53.500
Well, I said we could, the same way we could.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.740
Your question was, the parrot could maybe carry a monkey

35:56.740 --> 35:58.020
but could it carry a man?

35:58.020 --> 36:00.420
I was talking about boats to begin with

36:00.420 --> 36:02.820
and then I thought about the parrot bringing the monkey over

36:03.340 --> 36:06.400
and then I'm like, well, could the parrot bring a human over?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.180
But yeah, boats is what I was talking about.

36:08.180 --> 36:11.400
I don't know the capability of Dr. Shark's parrots

36:11.400 --> 36:12.700
all that well, you know,

36:12.700 --> 36:14.860
it's capable of in the extremes

36:14.860 --> 36:16.700
but I'm gonna say no, it can't.

36:16.700 --> 36:17.820
But yeah, the boats.

36:17.820 --> 36:20.080
Bring over as many men as we can get

36:20.080 --> 36:23.500
and I've got to go look for powders and potions.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.900
Waverly pulls out a whistle that's like a

36:25.900 --> 36:29.000
and that sends a few bread about boats.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.420
Yeah, the orders are sent.

36:30.420 --> 36:31.740
The orders are sent, yeah.

36:31.780 --> 36:33.620
So if the parrot's coming over.

36:33.620 --> 36:34.740
Oh, the parrot's coming over.

36:34.740 --> 36:38.140
You can hear Miss Knife, the wings flapping hard

36:38.140 --> 36:42.620
against this crisp summer sunshine air.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.260
Salty, baby, it's salty.

36:44.260 --> 36:47.060
So as the parrot flies up, I say,

36:47.060 --> 36:50.700
Mrs. North, you've got to lead the boats.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.820
Tell them to gather all the best men

36:52.820 --> 36:56.100
along with Mrs. Diggory and her barrel.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.680
You bring them back over here.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.300
Make sure the flow doesn't stop.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.500
Yes, do not interrupt the flow.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.700
That is of critical importance.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.140
Bring them back over here.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.580
We're leaving the mech beard, the ship

37:07.580 --> 37:10.540
and a weaker crew to their fights.

37:10.540 --> 37:11.580
You understand?

37:11.580 --> 37:14.620
Mrs. Knife says, cut it off.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.120
Moving on.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.120
Fuck yeah, dude.

37:17.120 --> 37:22.120
And with that, she takes off back to the other ship

37:22.860 --> 37:24.900
and we are on.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.680
Joe, I need to know what way the Adler is up to

37:27.680 --> 37:28.520
as you roll.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.360
Oh shit, it's a 95.

37:32.360 --> 37:36.000
I'm gonna have to use another luck to make it a 59.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.860
I'm down to one luck, my boys.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.600
But I don't feel like we can afford

37:39.600 --> 37:41.120
not moving at this point.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.780
No, I mean, this is the time to be spending it.

37:43.780 --> 37:45.440
I don't know if we want to set a precedent

37:45.440 --> 37:47.440
that we explain the luck roll,

37:47.440 --> 37:49.880
but he was turning, he thought he was turning

37:49.880 --> 37:51.480
toward the wind and he realized,

37:51.480 --> 37:53.280
oh fuck, it's the wrong, I mean,

37:53.280 --> 37:54.320
readjusted real quick.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.120
And then he actually caught a pretty good stream.

37:56.120 --> 38:00.160
I'm all for narrative explanations of the dice roll.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.440
I just say that because there's times

38:01.440 --> 38:04.080
where it may be really hard to describe.

38:04.080 --> 38:04.920
That's true.

38:04.920 --> 38:06.360
And that's where we get created.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.280
I dropped the gun.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.520
That is one thing I do like about a D20 system

38:10.520 --> 38:14.800
over maybe the D100 is the implicit scale.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.680
One being shitty, 20 being awesome.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.400
You know what a 15 is, you know what a 10 is.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.220
Sure.

38:20.220 --> 38:21.060
You know what a five is.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.960
I usually do that and then I times it by five.

38:22.960 --> 38:27.240
I feel the same way about the D100 system.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.560
Well, I would if Delta Green didn't use the weird,

38:29.560 --> 38:32.280
like actually lower rolls are not better.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.760
I love the blackjack rules.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.640
It makes me so happy.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.680
I like them too.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.040
It's just, I don't know.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.260
Well, the port deserters push ahead of you guys,

38:41.260 --> 38:42.100
unfortunately.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.600
Don't give a fuck, Zach.

38:47.120 --> 38:50.000
He wants to talk about the fucking game we're playing.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.160
The boat from the neckbeard ship

38:52.200 --> 38:53.840
starts heading toward you guys.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.120
They're actually heading at the correct angle

38:56.120 --> 38:58.440
to meet you on your way,

38:58.440 --> 39:02.320
but they are going to have to make it around

39:02.320 --> 39:06.160
the port deserters ship in order to make it to you

39:06.160 --> 39:08.320
as you are right next to each other.

39:08.320 --> 39:11.200
I would think that there are the rules of war

39:11.200 --> 39:14.480
where you don't shoot at a abandoning ship, you know.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.360
A tiny little ship.

39:16.360 --> 39:20.640
Unfortunately, we're pirates and we'll slay anything.

39:20.640 --> 39:24.120
And so my thought is shoot them before they shoot us then.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.040
Give it to me, baby.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.680
I'm down in, I don't see any of this happening.

39:28.680 --> 39:29.720
I'm down in the ship.

39:29.720 --> 39:33.680
I need you to roll for finding the correct chemicals

39:33.680 --> 39:36.100
to create this bomb.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.160
Which has the chemical symbol NEMO.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.000
I'm looking at like pre-made, you know,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.200
stuff I've made already.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.340
Where's the NEMO?

39:43.340 --> 39:46.720
The Necrotic Emulsifying Master.

39:46.720 --> 39:47.560
Ooz.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.380
Good.

39:48.380 --> 39:49.220
Ooz.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.500
Can this be a...

39:50.500 --> 39:51.580
No, it can't be.

39:51.580 --> 39:53.260
I don't even want to argue that.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.080
Uh...

39:54.080 --> 39:59.080
Thank you, friend.

40:00.220 --> 40:02.060
What were you going to say?

40:02.060 --> 40:02.900
What were you going to say?

40:02.900 --> 40:05.580
Can this be a heavy weapons roll that I just rolled?

40:05.580 --> 40:07.200
Oh, to find it?

40:07.200 --> 40:11.440
To find my chemicals that I'm going to use as a weapon.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.380
No, I would say like,

40:12.380 --> 40:13.660
if you're trying to distinguish

40:13.660 --> 40:15.180
between your stash of chemicals,

40:15.180 --> 40:18.180
knowing which one you use to make the heavy weapons like...

40:18.180 --> 40:20.060
Well, yeah, I'm thinking like I've got a wall

40:20.060 --> 40:22.420
of like just shit like I've made already.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.580
What's your heavy weapons skill?

40:23.580 --> 40:24.420
80.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.240
What'd you roll?

40:25.240 --> 40:27.700
An 86, which I could use luck to make a 68.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.940
How would you feel if you had to find the right gun

40:29.940 --> 40:32.440
out of a big rack of guns and used a firearm skill?

40:32.440 --> 40:33.340
Yeah, that's correct.

40:33.340 --> 40:34.700
Tight.

40:34.700 --> 40:35.580
Then I do it.

40:35.580 --> 40:36.940
I use my luck.

40:36.940 --> 40:37.980
Use that luck, baby.

40:37.980 --> 40:38.860
I appreciate that.

40:38.860 --> 40:42.380
You grab the wrong one and make it to the doorway

40:42.380 --> 40:44.260
and then something clicks in your head.

40:44.260 --> 40:45.340
You give it a big sniff.

40:45.340 --> 40:48.160
Well, I sniff it and I'm like,

40:49.000 --> 40:50.720
wait, this is literally to make it.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.080
This is a stink bomb.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.560
This is a stink bomb.

40:53.560 --> 40:57.160
And so I run back and I grabbed the one that basically

40:57.160 --> 41:00.860
it creates a cloud where like fire cannot happen in it.

41:00.860 --> 41:03.080
So they can't shoot any weapons.

41:03.080 --> 41:04.960
That's what I want to grab.

41:04.960 --> 41:05.800
It's a cloud.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.920
It's a cloud where fire can not happen?

41:07.920 --> 41:10.080
It's a cloud where fire can not happen.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.480
Such a bigger ask.

41:11.480 --> 41:14.840
Like we fire this onto their ship

41:14.840 --> 41:17.720
and it's basically like fire extinguisher shit.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.640
Like fire extinguisher shit explodes

41:20.640 --> 41:22.720
and so they can't fire any of their cannons

41:22.720 --> 41:23.560
because there's no fire.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.400
It gets all over their stuff.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.920
They can't get any of the wicks lit, yeah.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.160
No wicks.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.240
But I'm gonna keep both to where it's that

41:30.240 --> 41:34.300
and a stink bomb so that it gets funny.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.720
All right, well, that's awesome.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.560
And then I run back up.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.560
And then you run back up and that's gonna be

41:42.560 --> 41:43.500
your turn this round.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.260
I love that so much.

41:45.260 --> 41:47.040
All right, well, we better get going.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.660
Tick tock on these wicks.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.280
What is it?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.740
Dink, dink, the dink, dink man.

41:54.920 --> 41:58.200
Oh, that's a critical success for the port deserters.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.360
Fuck you.

42:00.360 --> 42:01.640
Fuck you.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.320
They're about to be some sticky like smelly bitches.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.440
You know what's really handy for you guys

42:06.440 --> 42:09.700
is that the port deserters make it so far ahead of you

42:09.700 --> 42:12.120
that the neckbeard ship can actually meet up with you

42:12.120 --> 42:14.140
this round with no issue.

42:14.140 --> 42:19.140
But I do need a sailing role from Sir Wavy Adler.

42:19.340 --> 42:20.940
Are they aboard now?

42:20.940 --> 42:21.760
Who?

42:21.760 --> 42:22.600
The neckbeards.

42:22.600 --> 42:23.420
No, not yet.

42:23.420 --> 42:24.260
They will be next round.

42:24.260 --> 42:26.380
When they're aboard, can they aid our sailing

42:26.380 --> 42:29.780
like with more, literally more guys in the fucking like,

42:29.780 --> 42:30.620
in the rigging?

42:30.620 --> 42:33.540
If Mrs. Diggory and the monkey,

42:33.540 --> 42:35.300
the monkey will be a lot of help, I assume.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.460
We talked about bringing over all the best neckbeards.

42:37.460 --> 42:39.580
Oh, you were bringing all the, I wasn't listening.

42:39.580 --> 42:40.420
So you guys.

42:40.700 --> 42:42.540
All right.

42:42.540 --> 42:44.300
Why can't the lady and the monkey

42:44.300 --> 42:46.340
help the ship go faster, Zach?

42:47.780 --> 42:49.460
That's how sailing ships work.

42:49.460 --> 42:51.580
You've got one old lady and a monkey.

42:51.580 --> 42:52.420
Monkeys are way stronger than you think.

42:52.420 --> 42:55.140
Have you never sailed, you fucking peasant?

42:55.140 --> 42:56.780
How much advantage do you want?

42:57.940 --> 42:58.780
Well, preferably like-

42:58.780 --> 43:01.140
I was thinking one giant long boat full of like-

43:01.140 --> 43:01.980
Double or triple.

43:01.980 --> 43:06.740
The hardest pirates with the biggest know-hows.

43:06.740 --> 43:08.040
Exactly.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.160
We got an old lady, the boat goes faster,

43:10.840 --> 43:11.680
you fucking mook.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.000
Extra blood, baby.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.800
Erupting out of the ocean,

43:19.800 --> 43:23.360
in between you and the shore of this island,

43:23.360 --> 43:27.320
seemingly every bit of blood that has been trailing

43:27.320 --> 43:30.520
out of these massive barrels

43:30.520 --> 43:32.960
on the back of all of these ships,

43:32.960 --> 43:37.520
all the blood is beginning to bubble on the ocean's top.

43:37.560 --> 43:40.520
And as it bubbles, it is creating a steam

43:40.520 --> 43:42.520
that is creating a fog that is-

43:42.520 --> 43:47.520
And masking all of your surroundings,

43:48.240 --> 43:50.480
the ship that is just nearby.

43:50.480 --> 43:52.360
I mean, it is right there.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.060
They're about to board.

43:54.060 --> 43:57.960
And then all of a sudden, gone in fog,

43:57.960 --> 43:59.880
you are completely surrounded.

43:59.880 --> 44:03.480
You can barely see the hand in front of your face

44:03.520 --> 44:07.560
and you can hear your entire crew panic

44:07.560 --> 44:11.280
over the sound of Mitch Diggory getting even louder.

44:27.360 --> 44:32.360
And you see that fog just billowing thicker and thicker

44:32.720 --> 44:34.680
as you continue to sail the ship.

44:34.680 --> 44:39.000
Oh, neckbeards, ahoy, are you out there?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.080
Roll the sanity.

44:43.320 --> 44:44.440
I pass mine.

44:44.440 --> 44:45.480
I also pass mine.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.200
And I'm gonna go ahead.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.840
You're asking me to think of a way to use my skills

44:49.840 --> 44:51.600
to get these guys aboard.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.720
I've got the perfect one.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.540
I'm gonna use spot hidden again

44:54.540 --> 44:56.400
to search them out through the fog

44:56.400 --> 44:59.540
and guide them in with my voice basically.

45:00.640 --> 45:01.600
And 18.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.080
Okay, yeah, that'll do it.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.400
They follow the sound of your voice.

45:05.400 --> 45:10.400
Ahoy, neckbeards, ahoy, your scrawny ass is up.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.040
Get aboard.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.080
It's a contest to win.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.960
And you can tell by these dark seas

45:15.960 --> 45:18.060
that there'll be hell to pay if we don't.

45:19.040 --> 45:23.100
It's a perfect tone to cut through this fog.

45:23.100 --> 45:27.360
And it is now blocking out the sun completely.

45:27.360 --> 45:30.640
So it is dark aboard your ship.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.160
Mrs. Diggory is still, what?

45:34.160 --> 45:35.080
With her barrel.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.080
Yeah, I get her and the barrel set up

45:37.080 --> 45:39.040
next to Mitch basically.

45:39.040 --> 45:42.120
But then I have my sword out and I look at Mitch

45:42.120 --> 45:45.640
and I say, boy, without you finishing your words,

45:45.640 --> 45:48.160
you should nod yes and no.

45:48.160 --> 45:51.040
If we lose this thing, are we dead?

45:52.660 --> 45:54.280
And he nods.

45:54.280 --> 45:58.060
If we lose this thing, are you and your mother dead?

45:58.060 --> 46:01.760
And a tear starts welling up in his eyes.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.100
And he nods.

46:04.100 --> 46:04.940
Cut his throat.

46:07.260 --> 46:09.060
It's still better to have two of them,

46:09.060 --> 46:11.180
though I'm of your way of thinking.

46:11.180 --> 46:14.060
I'm not around enough for you to hear me say that.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.860
No, you popped up on board.

46:15.860 --> 46:18.700
You popped up with your chemical mounted cannon

46:18.700 --> 46:19.540
in your cannon.

46:19.540 --> 46:20.980
Yeah, I look around, I'm like,

46:20.980 --> 46:23.140
squint, I'm like, oh, cut his throat.

46:24.860 --> 46:25.700
I'm a pirate, so.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.680
Mrs. Knife disagrees, she prefers torture

46:28.160 --> 46:29.520
and she suggests.

46:29.520 --> 46:30.460
Cut the legs.

46:32.720 --> 46:36.920
And her little wings are flapping the fog away from her,

46:36.920 --> 46:41.280
so you can see, you can always see Mrs. Knife a little bit

46:41.280 --> 46:45.760
as cutting through this fog, no matter where she goes.

46:45.760 --> 46:47.600
Like fucking crackers on that season of Archer,

46:47.600 --> 46:48.720
everybody but me hated.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.400
I love that season.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.440
I love that one too.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.100
It's one of the internet's least favorites

46:54.100 --> 46:56.160
and it's like, that's the best coma season.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.080
Adam Reed admitted during the Dreamland one,

46:58.080 --> 47:01.440
he was on a lot of pain pills for a surgery

47:01.440 --> 47:04.660
and it's like a really dark and fucked up and weird tone.

47:05.520 --> 47:09.480
What is Wavy Adler up to as he's trying to get the crew

47:09.480 --> 47:12.200
working together while they can't see each other?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.320
He's using that whistle that he whipped out earlier

47:14.320 --> 47:16.200
and he's actually prepared for this.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.740
You enter fog fairly often as a sailor,

47:18.740 --> 47:21.200
so they kind of know how to navigate through fog.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.400
So he's doing whistle commands that mean the things

47:24.400 --> 47:26.140
that we've been meaning all along.

47:27.100 --> 47:29.860
So it's like, means to get up on the ropes.

47:29.860 --> 47:34.460
And it's just this super like absolute fog.

47:34.460 --> 47:38.140
And each one of these people who are working on your ship

47:38.140 --> 47:43.140
as the crew, they're just individually moving by themselves

47:43.380 --> 47:46.100
with no idea of like what is happening.

47:46.100 --> 47:48.140
That knows what individually means.

47:48.140 --> 47:53.140
Yeah, but I just figured out that other people

47:54.620 --> 47:55.720
can do that too.

47:56.980 --> 47:59.820
I looked at Thomas and I was like, come on, don't do it.

48:03.020 --> 48:04.260
I'm like, he's on a roll.

48:06.580 --> 48:08.780
I almost stopped when I saw the look on your face,

48:08.780 --> 48:12.720
but then the way Joe and Zach got got, I stand by it.

48:14.260 --> 48:16.340
I need to roll through the fog, baby.

48:16.340 --> 48:17.800
These whistles are making it

48:17.800 --> 48:19.460
so you don't have to be at a penalty.

48:19.460 --> 48:20.940
It's a 63, I passed.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.020
Congratulations.

48:23.220 --> 48:26.020
You need three more successes to make it

48:26.840 --> 48:27.680
in a full circle.

48:27.680 --> 48:31.060
Something in your pirate bones tells you

48:31.060 --> 48:33.240
that you're exactly three successes away

48:33.240 --> 48:34.780
from completing this circle.

48:34.780 --> 48:37.980
Your navigational skills trying to figure out

48:37.980 --> 48:40.460
exactly where to meet back up with it.

48:40.460 --> 48:42.700
Please roll a navigation for me right now.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.380
That's a pass, a 36 on an 80.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.600
Navigation's technically my best skill.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.460
I should have been using that more.

48:50.460 --> 48:55.120
You can now hear in the distance right in front of you

48:55.120 --> 48:58.200
the chanting from two other ships.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.320
Fuck yes.

48:59.320 --> 49:02.520
Nearby, but they're in the fog.

49:02.520 --> 49:05.600
Okay, so I turn to Mitch and I ask him,

49:05.600 --> 49:08.520
man, does your chanting have to be loud?

49:08.520 --> 49:11.520
He gets a confused look on his face.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.600
Can you whisper the chant?

49:14.600 --> 49:18.720
Erwah, yoh, yee, yerp.

49:18.720 --> 49:20.200
Tell mother to.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.040
Eh.

49:21.040 --> 49:21.860
Blerp.

49:21.860 --> 49:22.700
Woot.

49:22.700 --> 49:23.540
All right, boy.

49:23.540 --> 49:24.360
Oh no.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.440
She fucked up, she broke the chant.

49:28.140 --> 49:29.920
Hey, hey, Zach fucked up.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.200
Mrs. Diggory.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.320
Oh no.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.040
You gotta roll for Mrs. Diggory.

49:36.040 --> 49:36.880
All right.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.400
That was you, bro, not her.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.040
She chugged some grog on the boat.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.440
She got in that boat.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.800
She was like, oh, oh no.

49:44.800 --> 49:45.840
What'd you get?

49:45.840 --> 49:46.680
It's an 88.

49:47.880 --> 49:49.200
She falls overboard.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.360
Oh my God.

49:51.360 --> 49:54.680
She coughs and then looks down and then looks scared

49:54.680 --> 49:57.680
and then looks at Mitch and she's like, I'm so sorry.

49:57.680 --> 49:59.600
I'm so, I'm so sorry.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.800
You have to keep going.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.720
You have to keep going for us.

50:02.720 --> 50:03.540
You have to keep going.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.800
Now we're together, we can make this.

50:05.800 --> 50:06.840
We can make it together.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.000
I just put my finger to my lips

50:09.000 --> 50:11.240
and give her a look like, we're pirates

50:11.240 --> 50:13.480
and we're gonna kill you if you don't stop talking right now.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.680
Your three faces are the only things

50:15.680 --> 50:19.040
that can be seen in this massive fog around

50:19.080 --> 50:21.760
and your hand reaches up out of nowhere

50:21.760 --> 50:24.000
to put a finger to your mouth

50:24.000 --> 50:25.640
and she quickly silences

50:25.640 --> 50:28.880
and then disappears backwards into the fog.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.080
All right.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.700
Wavy, what do you think?

50:31.700 --> 50:33.200
Silence all hands,

50:33.200 --> 50:35.760
slip by noise and quiet between the fog.

50:35.760 --> 50:36.920
We'll never know we were there.

50:36.920 --> 50:38.400
I love this idea.

50:38.400 --> 50:39.760
I love this idea.

50:39.760 --> 50:40.600
That's the idea.

50:40.600 --> 50:42.400
Stealthy as she goes, boys.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.240
And perhaps if-

50:43.240 --> 50:44.080
Stealthy as she goes.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.400
As soon as we bust out of the fog on the other side,

50:46.440 --> 50:49.080
you give them a load of that special powder of yours.

50:49.080 --> 50:52.280
I hand Jesus Christ like an empty iron ball.

50:52.280 --> 50:53.880
What does Jesus Christ look like again?

50:53.880 --> 50:55.920
He is an emperor, tamarind, penguin,

50:55.920 --> 50:58.600
so he's got the big mustache, monkey mustache.

50:58.600 --> 50:59.440
I thought he was a monkey.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.000
Penguin, did I say emperor, tamarind, penguin?

51:02.000 --> 51:03.640
Yeah, you did.

51:03.640 --> 51:04.680
Oh, no.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.520
Emperor, tamarind.

51:05.520 --> 51:06.760
You sent a monkey to the other ship

51:06.760 --> 51:07.600
and you got a penguin.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.440
He came back and there is some fucky stuff

51:09.440 --> 51:11.240
happening on this island.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.840
No, it's my monkey.

51:13.900 --> 51:15.480
And he, I hand him-

51:15.520 --> 51:16.560
He's a fucking penguin.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.920
This guy, he keeps calling it a monkey,

51:17.920 --> 51:18.960
but that's a penguin.

51:21.360 --> 51:22.280
We just let him have it.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.120
We let him have it,

51:23.120 --> 51:24.800
but he's going to some one of these days.

51:24.800 --> 51:25.960
We're gonna go up too far north

51:25.960 --> 51:27.360
and that penguin's gonna die.

51:28.320 --> 51:33.320
So this penguin, who I see still as a monkey,

51:34.520 --> 51:37.200
is mixing together the stinky stuff

51:37.200 --> 51:41.400
and the not fire stuff, putting it in this iron ball.

51:41.400 --> 51:45.080
And then I load it into my shoulder cannon.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.600
And I wait until I can see where I'm gonna shoot it.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.440
Awesome.

51:49.440 --> 51:53.640
In that exact moment, as I get a roll from Wavy Adler,

51:53.640 --> 51:56.520
you hear in the distance the crew

51:56.520 --> 51:58.920
from Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.520
You haven't been able to hear them yet,

52:00.520 --> 52:03.820
but everyone is being so quiet in this fog,

52:03.820 --> 52:06.980
except just in the distance, you hear some scrambling.

52:08.120 --> 52:11.720
Oh, oh, oh, yes, no, oh, we cannot find it.

52:11.720 --> 52:14.600
Oh, no, we have to make it back to the original location.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.480
Yes, to make the circle complete.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.280
No, we haven't quite made it back

52:18.280 --> 52:20.160
to the original circle yet, no.

52:20.160 --> 52:23.180
I passed the sailing roll, it's a 12.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.280
And a navigation for me, please.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.120
Another one?

52:26.120 --> 52:26.940
Yes.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.680
45 on an 80.

52:30.680 --> 52:31.880
Oh, yes, beautiful.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.720
Fuck yeah.

52:32.720 --> 52:37.560
All in the same round, Fancy Pyromancy on the Damsey,

52:37.560 --> 52:40.640
the Port Deserters, and Death of a Salesman

52:40.680 --> 52:44.980
have all completed their circle of the island.

52:44.980 --> 52:48.960
None of you have yet to complete the circle

52:48.960 --> 52:52.320
by finding the other end of your blood trail,

52:52.320 --> 52:57.320
which is now a thick, red fog that you can see.

52:57.760 --> 53:01.520
As the fog is coming around you, you see that ahead of you,

53:01.520 --> 53:06.520
where the fog is literally boiling up out of the ocean,

53:06.720 --> 53:10.960
it's red, and your trails are each lighting up red,

53:10.960 --> 53:14.560
and these massive walls going up to the sky,

53:14.560 --> 53:16.800
but you can't even see the sky anymore.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.840
There's nothing except for fog.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.600
Mitch, I have one more question for you.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.840
What do you think?

53:23.840 --> 53:25.000
If we win,

53:25.000 --> 53:28.200
what do we die?

53:28.200 --> 53:31.280
He gets a big smile on his face,

53:31.280 --> 53:33.060
and he shakes his head no.

53:33.980 --> 53:37.400
All right, Edward Spitz is fucking stoked.

53:39.060 --> 53:41.120
And he's gonna try to do a Spot Hidden role

53:41.120 --> 53:43.900
to find our blood smoke in the fog.

53:43.900 --> 53:45.740
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

53:45.740 --> 53:47.420
And passes with a 25 on an eight.

53:47.420 --> 53:48.260
Hell yeah.

53:48.260 --> 53:51.660
Awesome, so that is gonna be your first success.

53:51.660 --> 53:56.660
I've basically given each team three navigation successes

53:57.180 --> 53:59.600
to find the other end of the trail.

53:59.600 --> 54:03.040
So Edward Spitz, he used Spot Hidden,

54:03.040 --> 54:05.920
which implies some visuals, but he's a pirate.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.940
He uses all of his senses.

54:07.940 --> 54:09.880
As he searches through his spyglass,

54:09.880 --> 54:11.480
he sees nothing, but all of a sudden,

54:11.480 --> 54:14.460
he just catches a whiff of blood on the wind,

54:14.460 --> 54:16.600
and then sees a little wisp of red

54:16.600 --> 54:18.940
in the direction that he smelled that.

54:18.940 --> 54:22.320
And he tells Wavy, he's like, that way.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.420
Wavy, go ahead and roll that navigation.

54:24.660 --> 54:25.660
That's a 25.

54:27.660 --> 54:30.980
As you guys push forward into this,

54:30.980 --> 54:35.980
you hear a low rumble in the distance.

54:35.980 --> 54:40.980
And each one of you can feel the ocean approaching.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.780
Waves are heading toward you,

54:44.780 --> 54:48.980
massive waves from the island side.

54:50.780 --> 54:53.780
And then you finally get to the end of the trail.

54:53.820 --> 54:56.620
And then you finally hear it, this massive noise,

54:56.620 --> 54:59.320
this explosion of a ship,

54:59.320 --> 55:03.780
wood splintering in all different directions,

55:03.780 --> 55:08.540
and the cries of an entire ship's crew

55:08.540 --> 55:11.180
all at once through the fog.

55:11.180 --> 55:16.180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, oh fuck, oh shit, oh god, no!

55:21.700 --> 55:22.700
Not ours, right?

55:22.700 --> 55:26.100
No, it's in the distance through the fog.

55:26.100 --> 55:28.580
Why, thank god that's not our ship.

55:28.580 --> 55:30.900
I was really scared, I really fucking scared

55:30.900 --> 55:32.060
the piss out of me.

55:32.060 --> 55:33.900
I thought I looked around and I was like,

55:33.900 --> 55:35.980
I can't see anything, and I don't know if it was.

55:35.980 --> 55:38.580
In one group of pirates screaming in agony and terror,

55:38.580 --> 55:39.420
sounds much like another.

55:39.420 --> 55:40.860
Jesus Christ.

55:40.860 --> 55:42.180
I mean, I really thought that was some more,

55:42.180 --> 55:44.980
I thought I heard fucking Fat Johnny

55:44.980 --> 55:47.260
just squealing his little head off.

55:47.260 --> 55:51.100
Anyway, well fuck, have you smelled the blood yet?

55:51.100 --> 55:52.080
I smelled it a little bit.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.160
We're heading that way now.

55:53.160 --> 55:53.980
I thought, I thought I could.

55:53.980 --> 55:55.520
Holy fucking shit.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.800
Oh, like they said that back then.

55:58.800 --> 56:02.880
Suddenly, all the fog that isn't red completely dissipates

56:02.880 --> 56:05.860
and you can only see these massive walls

56:05.860 --> 56:07.880
that encircle the island.

56:07.880 --> 56:10.600
Boom, boom, boom, out like a bullseye.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.300
If you were looking at this from above,

56:12.300 --> 56:15.680
it would look like a Target logo, but with more of them.

56:15.680 --> 56:17.620
And Edward just shouts, I see it.

56:17.820 --> 56:22.820
You notice in this moment that it seems

56:22.820 --> 56:27.540
that the port deserters did not complete their own circle.

56:27.540 --> 56:30.100
They completed the neck beard circle.

56:30.100 --> 56:34.560
And in that moment, something absolutely obliterated

56:34.560 --> 56:36.940
their ship from the inside. Holy shit.

56:36.940 --> 56:41.940
And all of them are on the boiling ocean floor,

56:42.580 --> 56:47.340
floor, ceiling, ocean, ocean ground.

56:48.260 --> 56:49.420
Ocean surface.

56:49.420 --> 56:50.540
I like roof though.

56:50.540 --> 56:51.740
The roof of the ocean.

56:51.740 --> 56:52.940
The roof of the ocean.

56:54.620 --> 56:57.700
It probably is roof in like 99 out of a hundred languages

56:57.700 --> 56:58.740
or some shit.

56:58.740 --> 56:59.940
Yeah, right?

56:59.940 --> 57:01.780
If you're a fish making the language,

57:01.780 --> 57:04.620
it would definitely be your roof.

57:04.620 --> 57:07.260
There's gotta be so many fish languages too.

57:07.260 --> 57:09.340
Oh yeah.

57:09.340 --> 57:10.820
Oh, comparatively.

57:10.820 --> 57:14.100
We've got to break the ocean ceiling, you know?

57:14.100 --> 57:17.120
The death of a salesman and fancy pyromancy on the damn sea

57:17.560 --> 57:21.960
seem to be equidistant from their individual,

57:21.960 --> 57:23.760
nice, finishing line.

57:25.480 --> 57:26.320
Yeah.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.520
Yeah, sorry.

57:27.520 --> 57:29.080
I didn't want to break you for language,

57:29.080 --> 57:30.880
but you did it right.

57:30.880 --> 57:31.720
Yeah.

57:31.720 --> 57:32.540
You said all those words.

57:32.540 --> 57:34.440
I thought about telling you that you got it totally wrong

57:34.440 --> 57:35.280
and gaslighting you.

57:35.280 --> 57:36.120
I know.

57:37.480 --> 57:39.560
I thought about being like Zach thinks equidistant

57:39.560 --> 57:40.400
means the same distance.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.720
That is not what it means, dude.

57:43.640 --> 57:44.480
It does.

57:44.480 --> 57:45.320
It does though.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.600
Oh yeah.

57:47.040 --> 57:49.040
I couldn't see my face, but I'm like, wait.

57:50.760 --> 57:54.000
We're totally gonna make him believe that equidistant means.

57:54.000 --> 57:54.840
Equidistant.

57:55.840 --> 57:58.280
Sorry, I had to take off my headphones for a second.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.660
Where were we?

57:59.660 --> 58:01.720
We were equidistant, bro.

58:01.720 --> 58:06.720
Oh man.

58:06.760 --> 58:09.240
I bet even if we talk about how like this will be a bit

58:09.240 --> 58:11.760
where we gaslight Zach into believing equidistant

58:11.760 --> 58:13.080
doesn't mean what it means,

58:13.080 --> 58:15.400
we could still carry it out and like get him to believe it

58:15.400 --> 58:16.600
for a lot of the season.

58:16.600 --> 58:17.440
What do you think?

58:17.440 --> 58:19.600
The thing is I need to fire your cannons.

58:19.600 --> 58:20.640
I need to fire my cannons.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.800
I want you to describe.

58:21.800 --> 58:22.620
Okay, yeah.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.040
Well, I've got to get rid of this.

58:25.040 --> 58:29.000
And so as the fog clears on this ship,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.560
everyone sees you walking down from the top,

58:31.560 --> 58:35.880
walking down the steps to the deck, carrying what?

58:35.880 --> 58:37.720
The fog is dissipating at his sides

58:37.720 --> 58:41.400
as he's slowly walking toward the front with his.

58:41.400 --> 58:42.800
Well, walking towards the back, right?

58:42.800 --> 58:43.880
Cause they're behind us now.

58:43.880 --> 58:45.440
They are equidistant.

58:47.120 --> 58:50.600
It would be the front popping out of the fog.

58:50.600 --> 58:51.520
The side, yeah.

58:51.520 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, and Al has basically just like a small cannon

58:56.000 --> 58:57.080
on his shoulder.

58:57.080 --> 58:59.860
He lights a match off the cannon,

58:59.860 --> 59:03.160
hands it to Jesus Christ, his monkey.

59:03.160 --> 59:05.700
Jesus Christ grabs the tip of your cannon

59:05.700 --> 59:08.960
and angles it way higher.

59:08.960 --> 59:10.360
Oh, wait, what?

59:10.360 --> 59:11.380
Oh, right, penguin.

59:14.720 --> 59:16.720
It's totally a monkey, but the pirates don't know

59:16.720 --> 59:17.560
what a penguin is.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.120
They're like, that's a penguin.

59:19.120 --> 59:20.480
He's going to kill that penguin.

59:20.480 --> 59:22.360
It lifts up the top of the cannon

59:22.360 --> 59:25.160
to give you an extra bit of boost.

59:25.160 --> 59:27.840
And the Timurine Monkey is going to assist your role

59:27.840 --> 59:29.760
by lifting your cannon and showing you,

59:29.760 --> 59:33.680
we're going to have to fire really fucking far

59:33.680 --> 59:36.400
because we're back to the, almost the starting line.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.640
And you remember Fancy Pyromancy on the DMC

59:38.640 --> 59:40.640
was basically out of cannon mode.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.960
And he was just like,

59:41.960 --> 59:44.520
the monkey on the DMC was basically out of cannon range

59:44.520 --> 59:45.680
when we started.

59:45.680 --> 59:50.440
Thank God I found a monkey with geometry skills

59:50.440 --> 59:53.760
and like way higher thinking than I have.

59:56.680 --> 59:57.880
Let's roll this, baby.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.480
68 on an 80.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.680
21 on a monkey.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.620
Oh, yes, he won.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.240
All right, go ahead and roll.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.080
What is this?

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.920
It's a shoulder cannon.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.760
Yeah, it's a shoulder cannon.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.080
It's a firing combination of stinky potion

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.560
and giant fire extinguisher potion.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.000
Is this mounted on your shoulder

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.640
and the monkey is like adjusting its trajectory

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.280
or is the monkey on your shoulder

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.840
and the cannon's on its shoulder?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.240
The cannon is on my right shoulder.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.640
The monkey's on my left shoulder adjusting it for me.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.720
Generally, I would have like two people

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.240
like bracing me to do this,

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.080
but I don't need to, so I mean, it's-

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.420
He calls them Jesus Christ,

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.100
but we call him Trajectory the Gunnery Monkey.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:45.300
The monkey lights the cannon ball and we wait.

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.940
And as we're waiting, we're gonna see

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.780
if they can succeed on this navigation check

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.380
at the same time as Wavy Adler

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.940
to find out if we're gonna finish this race

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.200
before this fucking bomb goes off.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.040
Okay.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.180
I got a 94.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.280
I'm gonna use my very last luck to make it a 49.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.600
Fuck yeah.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.420
Hell yeah.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.260
When did you roll though?

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.440
I rolled a 59 and they have a 60.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.280
Oh.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.700
But because of Luke's cannon going off

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.840
in that exact moment,

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.400
as they're about to reach their blood trail,

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.020
it's right in front of them

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.380
and the fog is taking over the front of their ship,

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.560
but it hasn't quite made it to the back barrel yet.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.640
And in that final moment, right before you fired,

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.560
the monkey tilted the cannon just a little bit further

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.080
to the back of their ship.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.960
And you see this thing just-

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.400
Ew.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:53.740
And then-

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.120
Oh God, what's that smell?

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.520
That's the stink bomb part of it

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.280
as it mixes with the blood from inside the barrel

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.160
on the back of this ship as blood explodes everywhere

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.800
and Wavy Adler leads the death of a salesman

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.920
directly through the red fog,

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.940
right through until it takes over Mitch as he says,

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:19.780
what?

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.480
Okay.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.320
What?

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:24.880
Boom.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:32.200
In that moment, the red fog that you have created

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.480
completely disappears down into the water.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.080
Every other circle, each of them,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.520
one at a time going toward the island,

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.360
boom, boom, boom,

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.040
fog and maybe stone, some sort of cement

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.640
you've never seen anything like it,

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.080
erupting from out of the ocean.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.240
As each of these walls go up,

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.240
blocking off the island from view, the fog fucking like,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.920
each one of these walls moves forward

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.420
and the island disappears from view.

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.120
The fog is the only thing that you can see.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.920
And in that moment, I need all of you to roll sanity.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.000
Holy shit, this is fucking awesome, dude.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.960
I passed 33 on a 60.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.240
I also passed a 63 on an 80.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.200
I have 90 sanity.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.400
The wall next to you created a massive wave

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.280
that pushes you out further to sea

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.520
and directs the tip of your boat away

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.880
from where the island once was.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.540
The fog behind you dissipates.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.860
There is absolutely nothing there.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:46.700
What's wrong?

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.680
Well, what did we do wrong, Mitch?

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.600
Where's the island?

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.480
I don't know.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.760
How do we win this thing?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.440
Mother, mother, I thought that, is it over?

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.640
She walks up to him,

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.240
she's looking off the side of the ship.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.280
She's like, I suppose it's done.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.840
Huh?

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.060
You fucking fools.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.400
You rich fucking fools.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.640
You killed all these men.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.200
It's just to throw them walls up.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.920
Where are my riches?

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.120
Where's Wavy's riches?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.240
Where's the gold you mentioned?

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.260
There's a big score.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.780
That's what we were doing this for.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.500
Where's the fucking payout?

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.000
Al is waking up from being knocked out

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.900
by the force of his shoulder cannon

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.480
and he thinks everything is done now

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.180
so he looks up at Jesus Christ, high fives him

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.060
and stands up and then looks over at you guys.

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.820
So we did it, where's the gold and shit?

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.700
That's a great fucking question, Al.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.940
Where is the gold?

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.460
Mom, where's the gold?

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:46.780
Where's our power, Mrs. Tiggory?

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:50.860
You have all been excellent servants and-

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.340
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:57.720
You have completed exactly what we needed from you.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.460
Thank you.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.980
I have nothing for you,

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.900
but I appreciate the work that you've done.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.260
You mean other than the gold?

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.100
Yeah, right.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:07.920
Yes, that's right.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.380
Yes, take me back to port and we will get you your gold.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.220
The wall has disappeared and you turn back

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.820
and look at where the wall once was.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.420
No wall, no island, no fog, it's a beautiful sunny day.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.260
No island?

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.100
No island.

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.400
And what port does she mean?

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.180
Oh, back, you know, Jamaica.

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.580
Where's your fucking husband?

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.260
He seems to be gone.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.540
That's a bit of a relief, isn't it?

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.740
Are there still the husks of ships sinking

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.500
or are we alone on the ocean?

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.620
You are absolutely alone on the ocean.

01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:41.420
Mitch is still on board, right?

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.380
Mitch is still on board.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.260
Mitch, what the fuck is going on?

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.540
And I pull my knife out, but I have a smile on my face.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.380
But jovially.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.740
Yeah, I actually don't know.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.740
I mean, dad said that it would be, you know,

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:01.760
like world changing or whatever.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.540
And I guess it did change the world, but.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.500
Kill some pirates and build some walls.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.540
Build some walls to only have them fall down again.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.020
There's nothing left.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.180
Was your dad fond of you and your mom?

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.740
No.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:15.580
Okay, I see.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.820
I mean, yeah, in his own way.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.700
Yeah, but he might want to get rid of you or something.

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.940
Perhaps, maybe at some point.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.060
I just put my flintlock to Mitch's head

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:27.060
and I turned to Mrs. Diggory.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.300
You better tell us the real fucking scheme here

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.820
or I'll blow your son's brains out.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.300
Your husband changed the world, how'd he do that?

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.380
What changed?

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:37.780
What did we do?

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.500
She looks at Mitch.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.220
She looks at you.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.580
Looks back behind her over the edge of the ship.

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.900
She takes a step backward.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.920
I'm sorry, Mitch.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.220
She jumps backwards.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.020
Monkey tail in hand, monkey reaching out for.

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.580
Spitz watches her go.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.300
So Al thinks about,

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:04.180
Al thinks about having, grabbing Jesus's tail

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:07.660
and having Jesus grab her before she falls.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:11.020
But what really happens is he grabs Jesus's tail

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.700
and Jesus slaps him on the side of the head

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.100
and no safe attempt.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.180
Yeah, she succeeded for jumping off the ship

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.940
and she splashes down into the water.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.580
She fails her jump roll so she lands safely.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.900
On the next deck below.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.220
No, she jumps a couple inches in the air.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.780
She's on the roof of the water.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.820
Wavy turns to Mitch.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.500
But about that gold.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.380
Yeah, I don't think.

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.020
Oh, there is no gold.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.460
There's no fucking gold except maybe for his father.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.300
But we won.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.140
We won.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:44.980
Yeah, we won.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.020
We won someone else's game.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:49.260
We won someone else's game, Wavy.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:51.180
This game won for us.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.220
I turn to Mitch and I say, boy, you've got two options.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.700
He's just staring at the spot on the deck

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.060
where his mom jumped off

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.220
and his eyes are as full of water

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.500
as they possibly could be without a single drop falling.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.420
Mitch, it's pirate time.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.260
It's hard.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.740
People's moms are dead on this ship.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.660
So unless you want to join her,

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.940
you tell us where you think your father's gone.

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.860
Oh, I don't know.

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:18.020
I thought you were gonna ask me to be a pirate.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.140
You're gonna be like a prisoner pirate or something.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:21.980
I mean.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:23.900
Or you're gonna die unless you tell us.

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.740
Wait, but I don't know.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.380
Can I just be a pirate without being a prisoner?

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.220
What do you know about?

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.500
You're gonna die, Mitch.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.340
I'm sorry.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.980
What do you know about being a pirate?

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.940
You guys probably don't have anyone

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.540
who's like good at accounting.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.380
I could do that.

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.820
I didn't make him the offer yet.

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.060
Counting though.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.900
I don't think any of us know how to do that.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:41.940
Yeah, I can count.

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.260
As I was saying,

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.900
I don't give a shit what your pirate skills are.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.460
We'll find a use for you on this ship.

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.300
You can count.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.140
That's irrelevant.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.100
I'm sorry, but that's irrelevant.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.300
No, he's already bringing out the best in me.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.980
I'm gonna make you a bitch intern

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.620
for about like 24 months

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.500
before you'll get anywhere near accounting

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.860
after the stunt you've pulled.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.700
Do you understand?

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.420
Are you the captain?

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.620
No, but I'm in charge of personnel.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.460
There's no captain,

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.660
it's a pirate democracy,

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:14.500
except for you.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.340
You're at the bottom.

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.860
Wait, I can't be a part of the democracy?

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:18.780
No, you can't vote

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:21.460
unless you're a full vested crew member.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460
I disagree with that.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.060
I think everybody gets a vote.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.740
After they've been vested for six months on the ship,

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.460
until then they're provisional pirate members.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.900
Well, I don't remember it being six months.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.380
The voice says from the back.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.340
Well, maybe it's not quite a democracy

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.900
now that we've saved the day, huh?

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:41.100
I couldn't count though.

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.540
Well, that's why we need him for democracy.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.060
HR decision, and I've got my knife to his throat.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.980
And I say, Mitch, where might your father have gone?

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:54.500
I know you don't know,

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.340
tell us your best fucking guess

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.860
or slit your throat.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.020
Oh God, probably home.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.060
I would guess home or the last place he was,

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:02.880
which was on the island,

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.440
I don't know where the island is now.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.280
Edward is losing his patience and he like-

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.120
We can try to find the island.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.360
We can try to find the island.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.200
It's gone now.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.440
And maybe that's where the treasure all along was.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.280
Cause it's gone.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.120
I don't know.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.960
We're not gonna try to find an island school

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.920
and tell us where the fuck home is.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.520
Wait, hang on though.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.200
Mitch, if we wanted to find an island,

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.520
how would we do that?

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.400
You say that like that's something you know how to do.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.280
I guess we just like sail back to where we just were.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.320
What do you mean where we were?

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.240
We are where we were.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.040
He points to like a spot in the beautiful sunshiny day

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.040
that it is now.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.440
And he's like, wasn't the island like over there?

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.400
And hey, Wavey, super not.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.120
But like, you know where the island was.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.340
No, it was over there.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.920
But I get your point.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.160
Let's just go park our boat over top of it.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.800
Maybe it's below?

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.200
Yeah, maybe we'll find the old bastards ground corpse.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.160
I wanna pilot the ship over that direction

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.520
just to sit on top of the spot.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.320
Go ahead and roll navigation for me.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.000
Mm.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.640
18, for the listener,

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.800
Zach was giving me his hardest poker face.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.320
There was no, there was, it was-

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.520
While also making like cum noises.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.360
But it also, it wasn't-

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.680
Those are like Michael Bobaro noises.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.760
It was obviously, it was obviously a face

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.880
that was trying to not do either a frown or a smile.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.800
It was very strongly trying to be

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.640
the most neutral face you could make.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.760
You can see all my face right now.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.200
So I have to be very particular.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.960
You say try not to hide a frown or a smile

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.440
as if Zach would like hide his disappointment

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.240
if we guessed his little game.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.120
You've stumbled right into it.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.780
He's trying to hide that little fucking grin

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.400
from his bastard face.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.200
Cause we're gonna be eaten by Xith, Cthulhu.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.320
As soon as we fucking, anyway.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.160
The last shot.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.080
We did light up a target.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:51.920
The last shot.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.080
We're gonna go sit in the bullseye of a target.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.440
Trust me, trust me guys, let's get over there.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.280
You want me to navigate you.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.560
I agree it makes sense to check out the island.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.520
The last shot of this short story

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.440
is the death of a salesman heading toward

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.440
just a random spot in the open ocean somewhere

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.800
just Northeast of the greater Antilles

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.360
and T.S. Mayores in the North Atlantic Ocean.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.680
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.680
Key Lago, Montego, baby why don't we go to Key Lago.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:46.080
Barbados, I wanna take it down to Coco Mo.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.680
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.280
That's where we wanna go.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.880
Way down in Coco Mo.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.840
Bahama, come on.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.680
Dude.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.320
No, but there's no resolution.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.960
We don't find out.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.800
Well, I mean.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.640
That's a really good point.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.560
It's like the rest of season two.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.160
Just be sure to stock up on pirate nerd stats

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.240
and then you'll know about the history.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.080
There you go.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.880
Of the Dread Pirate neck beard

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.240
and the mysterious events that happened on Bullshit Island.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.160
Also be sure to stock up on t-shirts, towels,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.480
fanny packs, hats.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.400
Listen, the store is launched with season two.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.760
Get your shit.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.760
Buy more than one for your friends,

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.880
for you just in case.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.480
You never know how valuable this stuff's gonna be,

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.480
mint condition, so you gotta buy doubles,

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:50.320
you gotta buy triples.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.680
I'm no financial expert

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.560
and this doesn't count as real financial advice,

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.680
but I will 100% guarantee that any investment you make

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.000
in a PTPP piece of merch right now

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.000
will increase 1,000 gold by the end of the decade.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.640
That is a promise.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:07.960
There you go.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.520
We'll see you back.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.360
We'll see you back.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.200
We'll see you back.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.800
We'll see you back at home.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.640
We'll see you back.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.480
We'll see you back.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.320
That's the pain people say.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.160
We'll see you back.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.000
We'll see you back.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.840
We'll see you back.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.680
Hey, we'll see you back.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.320
All I'm saying is a $43 towel today

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.760
will net you $43,000 at the end of the decade.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.800
Wow, really?

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.120
That's such a good deal.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.360
I was thinking more like you pay 40 bucks for it now,

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.120
it's 60 bucks in 10 years?

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.800
Just because that's what a towel would be worth probably.

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.240
Some stupid old towel.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.480
No, but it's like a sick towel.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.320
It's 10 years old.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.720
It's a sick towel that you never used.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.440
Owned by one of our listeners.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.440
Even worse, owned by one of the hosts.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.840
Completely disgusting.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.040
I can smell each one of us individually nice right now.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.160
On their own?

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:01.000
Oh yeah.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.960
They said individually, didn't they?

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.360
Our smells are equidistant.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.520
Roughly.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.720
Good one.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.560
Good one.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.400
Come on.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:16:06.280
Hey, thanks everybody for listening to this short arc here in season two of pretending

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.120
to be people.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.160
There's going to be a few more of those for some backstory and other story goodies that

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.440
carry in with the plot of the main thread of season two.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.240
Very fucking excited.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.840
But I am here because I am at a loss for words.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:30.000
I don't know how to say how cool it was that Beth May from Dungeons and Daddies was on

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
our podcast.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Here's what I'll say.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Equidistant.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.440
I think it was like just like such a surreal moment and she was so fun to be at the table

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.440
with.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440
It was a dream come true.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.440
It was awesome.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.440
It was.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.840
We thought there's no way in hell it could happen.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.820
And really it turns out there is no way in hell that it can happen, but really we're

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:55.000
thinking Beth and she was lovely, but we got to thank her friend that she thought was huge

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
shout out to Travis.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Big shout out to Travis.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Big shout out.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Yeah.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.480
Travis, if you're out there, hit us up.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.440
Let's be real friends.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440
Yeah.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.440
Cause who else do you know?

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.440
Beth May already thinks we are.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.960
Anyway, Travis, you're out there.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.960
We're friends now.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.000
It's like we said, thanks Beth or whatever, but thank you Travis.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.640
No, seriously, Beth found out that we weren't the podcast she thought she was coming on

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.760
and still came on the show.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.760
Anyway.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:23.760
So cool.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:24.760
Very rad.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:25.760
Go listen to Dungeons and Daddies.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.760
Yes.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.760
Go buy her book.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.760
Yes.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760
I believe she said it was available in all bookstores.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760
I believe that's what she said.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.360
Go to your bookstore and buy it.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.680
I think she said like go to Barnes and Noble, have them order it and then go pick it up.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.680
There you go.

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:38.680
Thomas?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.800
I just think she's going to think what Luke said was really tragic.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:42.800
Which part?

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.800
The Barnes and Noble part.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.800
What about it's tragic?

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.080
You're supposed to actually see the joke was that you're supposed to preorder it at a small

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.080
local bookstore.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080
Oh.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080
You don't read.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.080
You don't know.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080
I didn't even think about it.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080
Oh my God.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080
You fucking.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.080
Why am I friends with you fucking idiots?

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.080
Okay.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.080
Sorry.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080
Answer it.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.080
Sorry I said Barnes and Noble.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080
Answer it.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.680
Barnes and Noble book buying bitches.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.680
Well, you know, support your local bookstore.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.680
I do.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.680
But when I think of bookstore, I think Barnes and Noble.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.680
We got one in town.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680
Yeah.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680
But I don't buy books from there.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.680
It's just that's where you buy books.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:45.680
Because my life is great and it's all my fault.
