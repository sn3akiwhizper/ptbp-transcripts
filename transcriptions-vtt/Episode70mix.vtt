00:00.000 --> 00:09.260
Well, well, well. It's one episode after the nice episode. Time to get more somber, I guess.

00:09.260 --> 00:19.660
Psych! It's always 69 o'clock here at 694.2 PTPB, my babies. Now, it may be episode 70,

00:19.660 --> 00:26.260
but when you're with me, Wolf the Dog, it always feel like some kinda 69 could happen

00:26.260 --> 00:34.660
at any time. You can feel that extra nice energy still lingering in the air. Very nice.

00:34.660 --> 00:40.700
I wonder if y'all can feel it 26 years in the past. But let's jump to the present, even

00:40.700 --> 00:46.980
though you're listening in the past. Hoo boy, this is confusing, y'all.

00:46.980 --> 00:53.040
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Atkull Underdash Saridwin, who tweeted about the

00:53.040 --> 00:58.180
show and tagged that pretendin' pod. It's really that simple, y'all, and it makes ol'

00:58.180 --> 01:01.340
Wolfie oh so happy. They write,

01:01.340 --> 01:07.540
Hey guys, heard about this weird little game number called Coffee Punk. Apparently it's

01:07.540 --> 01:15.240
about a bunch of punks on rollerblades stealing coffee from The Man. Go on over to At Neon

01:15.240 --> 01:21.580
Dreams 8 on the Twitter and check him out. Well, I can't wait to strap on some blades

01:21.580 --> 01:27.860
and roll roll roll away, but the only coffee I like is the kind that has been sittin' out

01:27.860 --> 01:34.200
for way too long. The kind you microwave to heat back up, but you know it's never gonna

01:34.200 --> 01:39.420
be the same. Something's changed inside of it. A darkness looms.

01:39.420 --> 01:45.660
But anyway, it sounds like a damn blast. Go have fun stompin' on The Man and stealin'

01:45.660 --> 01:52.260
all the coffee, ya punks. We make this show to feed our insatiable egos. If you've listened

01:58.540 --> 02:05.420

02:05.420 --> 02:13.300
wet review on Apple Podcasts. And you know what? We hungry too. Feed us over at patreon.com

02:13.300 --> 02:19.180

02:19.180 --> 02:24.900
This shit is gettin' outta hand, but really no quicker than reality. Strap in for a mood

02:24.900 --> 02:31.340
killer, it's time for the news. James, the executive director of Calm Comfy Campground,

02:31.340 --> 02:37.780
got inside the dreams or memories of our four PCs. Then they were in a bit of a canoe race.

02:37.780 --> 02:42.580
The Grimes took the lead while Jack Russell had a mental break, leaving him and Bradley

02:42.580 --> 02:48.700
Cooper at the back of the pack. But before that concluded, the four PCs and Alan Grimes

02:48.700 --> 02:54.340
were standing in a seemingly infinite room full of shelves filled with audio cassettes.

02:54.340 --> 03:01.580
For some of our greener listeners here at 694.2 PTBP, an audio cassette is a physical

03:01.580 --> 03:07.900
object made of plastic and polyester type plastic film with a magnetic coating. Most

03:07.900 --> 03:15.100
of them hold between 46 and 120 minutes of audio. The names on these cassettes were those

03:15.100 --> 03:22.700
of many politicians, CEOs, activists, journalists, religious figures, as well as a group consisting

03:22.700 --> 03:29.620
of Charles Digby, Roger Fairfield, Alan Grimes, Walter Grimes, and Martin Cupertino. I'd say

03:29.620 --> 03:34.940
it's about time for these PCs to wake the fuck up. Personally, one of my favorite things

03:34.940 --> 03:38.980
in the morning times is dream girl with pretty sexual.

04:04.940 --> 04:19.260
I pooped in my pants. So we got a comment on the question and answer

04:19.260 --> 04:25.980
thread on the subreddit over at r slash pretending to be people on Reddit. And we had it up 109

04:25.980 --> 04:32.100
days ago, but we recently got a comment that says the town only has one radio station and

04:32.100 --> 04:36.620
it's DJ plays the same song over and over and over again. Does that contribute to the

04:36.620 --> 04:43.180
town's low sanity? Does the station schedule include a top 40 show and is it no backbone

04:43.180 --> 04:48.260
40 times? What is he talking about? Yeah. Wolf the dog.

04:48.260 --> 04:51.420
He brings me a new song every day. Who is Wolf the dog?

04:51.420 --> 04:55.700
EJV is a dope new song every time I hear him. Brand new premier.

04:55.700 --> 05:00.620
Did you hear last week he played no backbone? That was so tight. I can't wait to see what

05:00.620 --> 05:05.980
you're up to. As soon as I heard it, I downloaded it. Yeah. You should go to Spotify. Check

05:05.980 --> 05:13.140
out kudzu, a band that a Wolf, the dog just discovered last week and shared with us. Well,

05:13.140 --> 05:18.060
let's not fail to mention the dream girl actual other song. So check out dream girl. Check

05:18.060 --> 05:22.340
out someone still loves you. Boris yells, someone's on a couple episodes and that's

05:22.340 --> 05:27.780
that band is Primo. We got blue false and to go. Oh yeah. That was a really good, those

05:27.780 --> 05:32.220
are the, I think those are that arc. Oh, in that thread. Uh, yeah, I think in one of

05:32.220 --> 05:37.700
the Patrion episodes I mentioned a band that I went on tour with free at last. They're

05:37.700 --> 05:45.520
fine. Go listen to them. I, when I saw that, I, uh, hadn't listened to them in a long time

05:45.520 --> 05:51.680
and, uh, went to their band camp and I forgot that the album artwork is pretty dope by an

05:51.680 --> 05:57.800
artist from Ozark, Missouri named Tim Peacock who, uh, now works for the new Yorker. Oh

05:57.800 --> 06:02.760
shit. Yeah, that's cool. It's a funny name. Tim Peacock. I like it. Yeah, it's good. From

06:02.760 --> 06:15.040
Guadalajara. What? He's from Guadalajara. Oh, is that in Ozark? No, that's in Mexico. Right

06:15.040 --> 06:25.600
next to the shitty little downtown they have downtown's. Okay. It's okay. It's not a downtown.

06:25.600 --> 06:34.600
There's a town square. There's a bank, a courthouse. Um, there is a little placard that tells about

06:34.600 --> 06:39.280
the time that they hung the bald numbers there. Oh, well those people were bad. Okay, so we

06:39.280 --> 06:46.120
need to do a roll off. All people aren't bad. Hey, I hope not. What if I just become evil as

06:46.120 --> 06:52.160
soon as I shave my head? You have been getting a lot more nefarious. Hey, quick question though.

06:52.160 --> 07:00.480
That's just cause I'm sadder. I liked my hair. Fucking judge me. I liked it too when it was

07:00.480 --> 07:15.160
there. I just going back to the ball numbers. I ain't got no hair no more. Okay, so we need to do

07:15.160 --> 07:20.200
a roll off and this is will matter for the game that we're playing. So you're all going to roll

07:20.200 --> 07:28.120
off against each other against 50 and if you get under 50 pass and if you all pass, whoever rolls

07:28.160 --> 07:35.200
lowest loses. How many rerolls do we get? Go through the rounds and if you, if you roll over

07:35.200 --> 07:42.080
50 then whoever rolls highest overall will lose. So let's start with Thomas. We'll go around 32.

07:42.080 --> 07:57.880
Oh, that's good. Luke. No, I'm saving my luck for me. 74. Oh, 74 Justin. 93. That's going to be

07:57.880 --> 08:06.960
difficult. Yeah, you can do it. Get higher than a 93. It's a 49. All right. He is right on the

08:06.960 --> 08:14.200
money. Best role and Justin had the worst role, so I'll keep that in mind moving forward for this

08:14.200 --> 08:20.320
game. That sounds, he's just going to treat Justin a little worse. Wait, so mine was best

08:20.320 --> 08:29.040
personally. Yeah. Well, I'm sad now. You're at the calm, comfy campgrounds. You should be,

08:29.040 --> 08:34.920
how could you be anything? But wait, was that Justin rolling or Charlie Charles? It's a,

08:34.920 --> 08:42.600
it was just a really great point. What is your name now again? Martin Scorsese. Martin Cupertino.

08:42.600 --> 08:49.040
Cupertino. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. It's a really cool fake name to pair with Bradley Cooper. Are

08:49.040 --> 08:56.000
we recording right now? I'm asking because you're getting up. I didn't know if you forgot

08:56.000 --> 09:03.240
to precariously perched a glass right behind you. I'm going to go ahead and drink this mango orange

09:03.240 --> 09:14.240
juice down so it doesn't spill. Where are we recording? Martin Cupertino wakes up. I need

09:14.240 --> 09:27.520
you to roll a constitution check. Yes. Crit success. Critical success. 44 on a 55. You

09:27.520 --> 09:36.440
feel so strange, like something within you has changed. Like Martin Cupertino is very aware of

09:36.440 --> 09:42.960
how his engine runs. And you know, I didn't spend the last 15 years mastering Transcendental

09:42.960 --> 09:49.040
Buddhism to not be in touch with my inner workings. But you have so much control that

09:49.040 --> 09:56.120
you can keep down anything like strange or painful about how you feel currently. Like you feel almost

09:56.120 --> 10:01.840
like, you know, when you're so hungry that you feel like you're going to like pass out. Yeah.

10:01.840 --> 10:11.280
That's essentially how you feel. And you realize that your left arm is throbbing. And when you look

10:11.280 --> 10:19.760
down, you see that you have a little bit of dried blood right in the crook of your elbow. Like I'd

10:19.760 --> 10:25.320
been hooked up to a, like they were taking my blood. Something like that. Or an IV or something.

10:25.320 --> 10:31.440
Yeah. Yeah. It left a little mark and you feel pretty weird. All right, Martin. Odds are you've

10:31.440 --> 10:35.800
been drugged, but you've got your wits about you critically. I want to look around the room. Yeah,

10:36.440 --> 10:41.840
did I wake up in my bedroom? Yeah, you did. Okay. So I mean, that's, that's all I want to know,

10:41.840 --> 10:50.320
I guess. But I rolled 99. That's fantastic. What is this? Where am I? As you get ready,

10:50.320 --> 10:57.320
how, what is your, what does your morning routine look like? Martin wakes up at like 4.30 AM. He

10:57.320 --> 11:02.440
makes a smoothie. So when you go downstairs on your way to make your smoothie, did you put the

11:02.440 --> 11:10.120
floorboard back? Yes. It is removed. You don't notice it and you kind of trip and your leg goes

11:10.120 --> 11:17.720
into the hole. I need you to roll a D4. What? You just lose one hit point, but you like wang your

11:17.720 --> 11:24.400
ankle to the point to where you have to, like, you can't walk quite normally. Well, that's okay. I'm

11:24.400 --> 11:28.880
about to do my stretches. So probably work that out. Smoothie and stretches? Smoothie and stretches.

11:29.720 --> 11:35.400
That's Martin's time. Does it feel like the right time of day for him to be waking up? It does. Okay.

11:35.400 --> 11:41.160
Then about two minutes after he actually wakes up, his little digital watch starts beeping and he's

11:41.160 --> 11:51.520
like, beat you again. Did this, uh, did this night of maybe not quite rest, uh, give you any? Well,

11:51.520 --> 11:55.800
it's the last thing I remember being in the room with all the tapes. Vaguely, but it's almost like

11:55.840 --> 12:01.680
that memory along with countless others are consistently swirling around in your head. Does

12:01.680 --> 12:07.080
it feel more like I just woke up after my first day? Yeah. This place is weird. I want to do a

12:07.080 --> 12:13.160
physical like inventory of myself. Okay. You said I feel weird. It looks like a needle's been in me.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.840
Yeah. How do I feel weird? Do I feel like I've been drugged or anything? A little bit. Like,

12:16.840 --> 12:23.800
uh, just a little hard to focus or a little out of it. Okay. So you remember how last night when

12:23.800 --> 12:29.520
you were pulling up the floorboard and stuff, you were trying to think of how you got to calm,

12:29.520 --> 12:35.080
comfy campground and it like tripped you out that you had no memory of even like the boat ride to

12:35.080 --> 12:45.320
the Island or anything like that. Now you know full well that you have absolutely no memory of

12:45.320 --> 12:51.840
getting here or even finding out about calm, comfy campground, all the memories of your friends

12:51.840 --> 12:58.400
telling you that you needed to get help seem off in some strange way, how you found out about calm,

12:58.400 --> 13:07.840
comfy campground. That memory itself is warped. Roll sanity. Critical success. 22. Wow. Yes. Yes.

13:07.840 --> 13:15.440
Okay. So, uh, with that, uh, not only do you know that this is your second day at calm,

13:15.440 --> 13:19.920
comfy campground, but you also know full well that it's not. Looks like the world's finally

13:19.920 --> 13:23.680
catching up to the possibilities of my kind of thinking. I'll have to figure out what the,

13:23.680 --> 13:28.040
what kind of time dilation device they've got going on here, but in my really helping

13:28.040 --> 13:32.200
cube or something, you know, someone gets in a, an online game or really as I don't know,

13:32.200 --> 13:36.760
I think it could be handy. You can make people work forever in a time where they're stuck.

13:36.760 --> 13:47.480
He's hard. Is so the, the, the floorboard was open. Yeah. Was the stuff gone? Interestingly

13:47.880 --> 13:52.880
enough, everything that you took out of the bag is still with you or where you put it,

13:52.880 --> 13:57.360
but the bag itself is gone and everything you left in the bag is gone with it. So you

13:57.360 --> 14:02.040
still have the cassettes and the map. I was listening to the episode and I completely

14:02.040 --> 14:05.800
spaced the syringe that was in there. Do I feel like that's a possibility for what I

14:05.800 --> 14:10.720
got injected with? I mean, I'd like to start looking around the corners of my room for cameras.

14:10.840 --> 14:23.520
Okay. Yeah. Roll search 58 on a 20, even though you have this weird out of place memory of finding

14:23.520 --> 14:30.120
out that you were being watched, you kind of think that maybe that memory is faulty because

14:30.120 --> 14:37.840
there are no cameras in this cottage. Like turn my TV on, go for it. And flipping around and you

14:37.840 --> 14:43.120
get normal channels. Interesting. Not as interesting as watching me presumably, but this is interesting.

14:43.120 --> 14:48.160
I've never really watched TV. It's for weak minded individuals. There's a commercial for a

14:48.160 --> 14:54.520
mattress place. Come on down to Leroy's mattresses. We got the finest place where you can put your

14:54.520 --> 15:06.200
head down on a bed. Sounds about right. I click it off. Walter, you wake up and Alan is looking

15:06.240 --> 15:15.760
right at you. And he's like, how do you feel? Roll constitution. 21 on a 60. You feel fine,

15:15.760 --> 15:23.200
but you know something with your system is wrong. And he grabs your arm and he holds it out. And you

15:23.200 --> 15:29.640
see on the inside of your elbow pit, there's a little mark where some dried blood is there.

15:29.640 --> 15:37.080
And he holds out his arm as well. And he's like, what is going on? Were you down all night? I,

15:37.080 --> 15:45.440
the last thing I remember is, uh, well, I was in a canoe with you and then we were at like a,

15:45.440 --> 15:50.560
Oh my God. We had to put the shelves, the metal shelves. Were we at a music store or no, we were,

15:50.560 --> 15:56.280
we were with the, the floor was made of blight. It was like that scene in the matrix. Oh my God.

15:56.280 --> 16:05.040
What was that? Were we there? Did you have that same dream? Is there any way for me to do a

16:05.040 --> 16:10.040
systems check on myself by rolling constitution, which you already did. So you know that something

16:10.040 --> 16:20.240
is off, but I can't like have like a printout. No, but you do know that something, something is

16:20.240 --> 16:28.200
strange because those memories that are part of your dreams, maybe with Alan having the same

16:28.200 --> 16:34.600
dream, you, you, you start to realize maybe, Oh fuck, this isn't, this isn't the second day that

16:34.600 --> 16:41.560
you've been to calm, comfy campground. It's not the second day. Something is, but linear timeline

16:41.560 --> 16:51.480
should tell me that it should be the second day. Yeah. Roll sanity. Ought one. Holy shit. Verified.

16:51.480 --> 16:58.840
I don't, my computer doesn't work that way, so I'm not freaked out. I am alarmed though. Yeah.

16:58.840 --> 17:05.200
Can I do a medicine or something like for not first, maybe medicine to feel Alan's pulse and

17:05.320 --> 17:12.320
see if his heart rate is normal and see if do like a overall check to see if the not armpit,

17:12.320 --> 17:19.440
but elbow pit is the only thing off. Oh yeah. Yeah. You can. Oh yes. Yes. Please, please give me

17:19.440 --> 17:28.680
up. Give me a physical and you guys can take your time. 89. Oh yeah. I had three. Yes. Yes,

17:28.680 --> 17:36.440
of course. So Alan Grimes just begins looking high and low through this cottage. He's like,

17:36.440 --> 17:42.720
someone must have been in here. I have an idea. And I go over to the television and start scrolling

17:42.720 --> 17:49.440
through channels. Um, when I turn it on, is it still tuned into, um, Bradley Cooper, Martin

17:49.440 --> 17:54.840
Cupertino? No, it is not. What is it on when I turn it on? It's on Price is Right. Okay.

17:54.840 --> 18:07.320
But I'm on stage is a bookshelf, a TV stand with a brand new television and, um, some leather

18:07.320 --> 18:17.040
couches. Sure. Uh, uh, lazy boys. Yeah. 37 59. And then I start scrolling through. Yeah. And as you

18:17.040 --> 18:22.120
scroll through, you find just completely normal channels that you get like right outside the

18:22.120 --> 18:29.760
city. But when you come back to wheel of fortune, it pops up 37 50 prices, right? Yes. Sorry. I

18:29.760 --> 18:35.760
thought you were saying the price was right, which it was 37 59. You said, well, you would have gone

18:35.760 --> 18:44.240
over. Yes. I hear that now. No, I said 37 59. That's that's what pops up. Cause I know I've

18:44.360 --> 18:52.320
studied catalogs. Um, anyway, so I can't find any security footage. No, no longer here. Oh, you,

18:52.320 --> 18:57.840
you booked for cameras about how many channels are there? Like just average. Okay. I want to do a

18:57.840 --> 19:04.880
search role to see if there's a camera in our cabin. Yeah, for sure. A neural search pass with

19:04.880 --> 19:15.440
a six on a 36. I think I wrote over that without erasing it. So, and I'm going to add seven. Nice.

19:15.440 --> 19:22.240
So as you're looking around, not only do you find more than one camera, you find like four cameras,

19:22.240 --> 19:27.400
all posted up in different rooms. You find microphones. Are they like hidden? Like,

19:27.400 --> 19:32.680
yes. Supposed to be discreet. Yes. They are quite discreet. And you find microphones hidden in

19:32.800 --> 19:40.840
different objects around the rooms. And you also find a shoe print that is quite small,

19:40.840 --> 19:47.600
like muddy footprint or like dirt, something. I'm going to, and it is at the front door. When

19:47.600 --> 19:54.240
I find those, I'm going to keep them in place as to not arouse suspicion. Sure. Go ahead and

19:54.240 --> 19:58.920
roll stealth to see if you can like find them without, if someone was watching what they

19:58.920 --> 20:05.000
realized. Damn. I'm rolling good today. Four on a, I assume 30. Yeah. Yeah. So you can,

20:05.000 --> 20:12.160
Adam. Oh, hell yeah. So you can see all of those different cameras and microphones without the

20:12.160 --> 20:17.920
cameras and microphones realizing. Okay. I'm immediately going to go over to Alan and non

20:17.920 --> 20:29.240
verbally, like he's pointing. Sorry. This is an audio medium. I point at like where the cameras

20:29.240 --> 20:34.760
are. Yeah. And I point at like where the microphones are. And I, you do it in a way that

20:34.760 --> 20:43.640
is very discreet. Yeah. But to convey, yeah. So I, oh my gosh. What, what do you want per

20:43.640 --> 20:49.400
pool? It's pretty nice outside today. Maybe we should take a walk. I think that's a very good

20:49.400 --> 20:55.800
idea. Okay. We go outside and yeah, we get five or six steps away from the front door and I'm like,

20:55.800 --> 21:01.680
what is, what is going on here? I have no idea. This is, this is untenable. I, how, how did you

21:01.680 --> 21:10.680
find this place? Why? I know why we came here, but how did you find this particular place? Did

21:10.760 --> 21:21.120
you use your AOL CD rom? Oh, hell yeah. Alan rolled some dice for sanity, failed miserably.

21:21.120 --> 21:28.240
Oh, Oh no. Walter, Walter, the more that I go back into my mind, the more that I'm realizing,

21:28.240 --> 21:34.400
I don't think that. Do you remember? Do you remember coming here? He's got his hands on his

21:34.400 --> 21:40.280
head and he's looking at you with massive eyes. Do you, do you remember coming to this Island?

21:40.280 --> 21:50.800
I, well, we would have had to get here when he showed us that the first thing I remember is that

21:50.800 --> 21:56.560
we were just standing at the, on the Island and we walked up the, we walked up the pathway. I

21:57.520 --> 22:05.000
assumed maybe I was shut down for the ride here. And then you woke me up when, when we got here.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.640
Oh, I, I can't even, I saw an ad. I thought I saw an ad, but when I go back to that memory,

22:12.640 --> 22:18.560
I, I, the ad for calm company campground, it's all swirling. It's all, it's all a part of the

22:18.560 --> 22:24.480
same. Oh, the memory is, and you just see his head kind of hang. And it's the first time you've seen

22:24.480 --> 22:41.280
your father without full confidence in himself. That freaks me out. Oh my God. My computer

22:41.280 --> 22:48.760
doesn't compute. This just doesn't make much sense. I, so in the dream, well, I don't know

22:49.000 --> 22:57.320
if it was a dream or not. If we were actually there when, when I saw Brad piece of shit's name

22:57.320 --> 23:05.400
is Martin. When we saw him on the television, he had tapes from there. Do you think he's part of

23:05.400 --> 23:16.160
it? I won't dismiss that idea. He might be part of it. And Jack, Jack Russell, we can't trust him

23:17.120 --> 23:23.040
either. Can we Walter look at me and he gets very serious and he puts his hands on your shoulders.

23:23.040 --> 23:33.680
We can't trust anyone except for each other. A little bit in the back of my mind tells me

23:33.680 --> 23:45.920
I can't trust him either because of, you know, when he tried to sell me, but I say, right,

23:45.920 --> 24:08.000
we can only trust each other. I spent so much time thinking about how that bad memory thing

24:08.000 --> 24:15.480
would work out that I forgot that I'd had to role play this character more just pass that. Oh yeah.

24:15.520 --> 24:22.040
I have to think on my feet as Roger still. Well, Roger Fairfield wakes up with the book of flora

24:22.040 --> 24:34.520
and fauna on his chest. I need you to roll a constitution check. I pass a nine on a 70. You

24:34.520 --> 24:41.560
feel super fucking weird. Like something is off with your body. Like you are a very particular

24:41.880 --> 24:48.200
person. You know how you feel. Something is wrong and your arm hurts. And when you look down,

24:49.000 --> 24:55.480
there is a little bit of dried blood, like a little mark of dried blood right in the pit of

24:55.480 --> 25:03.080
your elbow. Interesting. Is it daytime? It's morning and you can hear Angela in the kitchen.

25:03.080 --> 25:08.680
Do I remember things that happened? But all those memories are swirling around. Like

25:09.560 --> 25:16.600
they feel like a dream, but they also felt so real. And with everything that's happened,

25:16.600 --> 25:28.360
go ahead and roll sanity. I pass a 57 on a 60. You can put it out of your mind enough,

25:28.920 --> 25:36.840
but something inside of you tells you that this is not your second day at calm, comfy campground.

25:38.680 --> 25:45.480
Breakfast is ready. And the door pops open to the study. She's like, you slept in here all night.

25:46.920 --> 25:53.880
I guess so. I guess I dozed off. Are you feeling okay?

25:53.880 --> 25:57.880
Yeah. Bright and early. Ready to go. Time to work on ourselves.

25:58.520 --> 26:04.440
Yeah. Yeah. You didn't dream about anything?

26:04.440 --> 26:10.120
Do you really want to hear? I guess. Okay. So it was crazy. I was standing in the supermarket

26:10.120 --> 26:16.200
and everything on the shelves was made out of styrofoam. It was so terrible. You know

26:16.200 --> 26:18.520
how I have that thing with styrofoam? Sure.

26:19.560 --> 26:27.000
It just pains me to no end. And I just had to go shopping for some reason. And I kept grabbing

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
stuff and it just made my spine hurt. Zach, I was in character. I was asking Angela.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.240
Okay. That's my bad. I fucking hate styrofoam. Yeah, he does.

26:39.240 --> 26:44.360
It gives me a physical negative tick. So we went out to brunch one morning

26:44.360 --> 26:48.200
and I got a to-go box and I was carving my name into the top of it.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.640
You're just saying that. And I thought I was killing you.

26:51.640 --> 26:55.160
I didn't know. Maybe Thomas yelled, stop, you're killing him.

26:56.120 --> 26:58.920
And I realized, oh shit, that's a real phobia you got.

26:59.000 --> 27:07.560
It's so bad. It's part of the inside of me. It's been happening forever. And I did theater

27:07.560 --> 27:15.080
in high school and a lot of high school theater sets are made using a lot of styrofoam. And one

27:15.080 --> 27:23.720
day I was walking through the wings backstage and this massive, probably 10 by 10 foot sheet

27:23.720 --> 27:30.680
of styrofoam was laying on the ground and people were hanging up another equally sized sheet and

27:30.680 --> 27:39.000
they dropped it and it floated down. Oh God, just saying it. It floated down and it landed perfectly

27:39.640 --> 27:43.720
to where it slid across the top. Oh my God.

27:43.720 --> 27:47.560
I literally fell on the ground and just convulsed a little bit.

27:47.560 --> 27:51.080
I don't have this phobia at all, but that kind of got me a little bit. That's a weird

27:51.080 --> 27:57.560
sensation I can picture. God, I hate it. Fuck. I actually played in a Pathfinder game with our

27:57.560 --> 28:04.920
friend Andy and he was running the game and it was a horror Pathfinder game. And he asked Taylor,

28:04.920 --> 28:14.920
what would fuck me up? And she told him. And so when the really creepy thing happened in the game,

28:14.920 --> 28:19.080
from underneath the table, he just pulled out two pieces of styrofoam and rubbed them together.

28:21.400 --> 28:26.120
It hurt me to the point to where he apologized. Yeah, right. Shot through your spine.

28:26.120 --> 28:35.560
But it was good. It was good GMing. Anyway, so that's my dream. It was wild. I don't even know

28:35.560 --> 28:41.800
what it means. You didn't dream about the lake at all, did you?

28:42.360 --> 28:48.760
No, I know it's kind of weird, but no, I kind of think the Blackwater is cool looking.

28:49.400 --> 28:58.600
Yeah, I thought that too. I'm going to get in the shower and I'll meet you, I guess,

28:58.600 --> 29:03.640
outside. When's the first? What do we do next? Are we meeting with somebody?

29:03.640 --> 29:07.800
She grabs a piece of paper and she's like, yeah, we need to be at the main house next,

29:07.800 --> 29:10.280
coming up pretty soon. So you have time to shower. It's all good.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.480
Okay. I'll meet you outside, I guess. Roll alertness as you go to the shower.

29:18.920 --> 29:24.360
I pass another nine on a 40. As you're still in the study before,

29:24.360 --> 29:29.560
she turns back and goes back to the kitchen and you notice that the window in this study

29:30.360 --> 29:38.200
was definitely closed and locked last night when you went to sleep. And it's definitely cracked

29:38.200 --> 29:46.760
open a little bit right now. And on the windowsill, there's a hair tie with some dark brown hair.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.200
Not Angela's hair? Not Angela's hair.

29:50.200 --> 29:54.760
A hair tie. Okay. So Roger can discern that it's not her hair on site?

29:54.760 --> 29:57.240
On site. Okay. I'm going to hold it up. Angela,

29:57.800 --> 30:01.320
did you have a friend over or something? What's going on with this?

30:01.320 --> 30:05.400
She comes back into the room and is like, what? What? I just found it over by the window.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.880
Did somebody come in last night? And her hair is just this

30:10.680 --> 30:18.360
flowing mane of curly hair. And she's like, well, I, as you well know, don't live my life

30:18.360 --> 30:23.000
with my hair up. I know. I know. I like that.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.880
No, that's weird. What? Would someone? I guess it could have been somebody who

30:27.880 --> 30:31.400
stayed here from the last time. Oh, yeah. Last week. For sure.

30:31.400 --> 30:35.240
I think they do this like every weekend probably. It's weird that the window, I could have sworn.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.640
Okay. Are you okay?

30:37.640 --> 30:44.360
Yeah. I just, I had a, I just had a rough night. I guess I should've, I shouldn't have fallen asleep

30:44.360 --> 30:48.280
in that chair. That's probably what did it. Yeah. Yeah.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.920
Okay. And she pops back out. Cool.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.360
Yeah. I'm going to go to a shower and meet her up front.

30:54.360 --> 31:00.600
She's going to skip to the big house. Oh, okay.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.920
Oh no. Not like. I thought she was going to skip.

31:03.720 --> 31:09.320
I'm going to get drunk. It doesn't matter. No, she's just going to skip to the Lou.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.080
Nice. My darling.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.880
She stopped skipping and explodes.

31:21.880 --> 31:27.000
Roll scene. You're following her and she's skipping ahead a little bit.

31:27.960 --> 31:34.120
And as you guys are approaching the main house, there's a big like wrap around porch on this

31:34.120 --> 31:38.600
hexagonal building in the middle that you like walked up the stairs to go through the main door

31:38.600 --> 31:45.080
and standing up there is James wearing the same white dress shirt as yesterday.

31:45.080 --> 31:52.760
Maybe not the same one keeping the uniform and next to him is a young girl seems to be

31:53.160 --> 31:57.160
10, 11, 12, somewhere in there. And she's got pigtails.

31:58.840 --> 32:08.520
And as they see Angela and Roger Fairfield walking up, the little girl gets a big smile

32:08.520 --> 32:14.040
on her face and runs off the porch. Go ahead and roll human for me.

32:17.960 --> 32:21.160
Fail. 67 on a 10.

32:22.120 --> 32:33.320
You notice nothing as this little girl comes running up and she is going Anne, Anne, Anne

32:33.320 --> 32:39.880
with a big smile on her face and runs up and tries to give Angela Fairfield a hug.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.840
How does she react? I don't think I would stop it or anything.

32:44.200 --> 32:48.040
Get away from my wife, child. That's my wife.

32:48.920 --> 32:58.120
And Angela backs up and is like, Oh, hi, I'm, I'm Angela. It's what's your name? And the

32:58.120 --> 33:03.080
girl looks up at her confused. It's like, I'm a Maggie.

33:03.080 --> 33:17.960
Fuck you, Zach. Can I, is, uh, is, can I tell this girl and with her hair,

33:17.960 --> 33:22.520
can I compare it to the hair tie I saw in my room? Is it probably her hair tie?

33:22.520 --> 33:27.480
And I think it's probably hair time. Holy shit. Yeah. There's lots of people named

33:27.480 --> 33:41.720
Maggie, I guess. Have you ever had a hit of just the mango nectar that you can get in like the

33:41.720 --> 33:46.760
bottle? It's weird that it's called have you seen, I have gotten a hit of the mango nectar.

33:49.560 --> 33:55.960
It's just the fruit with water in it. It's the nectar of the mango.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.320
You heard what I said, Justin. Gross.

34:01.960 --> 34:04.280
The nectar of the man go all over the place.

34:07.160 --> 34:15.480
Charles Digby. You wake up staring. Who? Who me? You wake up staring at the walkie

34:15.480 --> 34:18.840
talkie on your nightstand. Roll constitution.

34:18.840 --> 34:27.240
That is a no, no pass. You feel fucking terrible. Yeah.

34:28.200 --> 34:35.480
Terrible to the point to where you feel, Oh God, what? Oh, in your arm, like all over you feel

34:35.480 --> 34:40.920
weird, but your arm specifically hurts. And when you look down at it, you see that on the inside

34:40.920 --> 34:47.560
of your elbow, there's a little bit of dried blood and there's a slight bruise around it.

34:48.440 --> 34:56.680
And you feel as if you may have been drugged. Oh, Oh yeah. Like a, like the syringe entrance

34:56.680 --> 35:00.600
and you feel woozy. Oh no. I need you to roll sanity. Okay.

35:04.840 --> 35:10.600
Uh, 19 with the pass, whether I have a 10 sand in those memories

35:11.320 --> 35:15.880
from last night, they're still swirling around, but you can kind of push them down

35:15.880 --> 35:24.040
enough to not dwell on them too hard. But at the same time you have this investigators sensation.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.920
Something's awry. Not only is something awry,

35:26.920 --> 35:34.840
but this is not your second day at calm comfy campground. Oh, what day is it? You have no idea,

35:34.840 --> 35:44.520
but this is not normal. Those memories, they might be real. They might not be, but you don't

35:44.520 --> 35:50.520
feel like you just arrived here. Yeah. Is the walkie talkie on? It still is on. Can I like

35:50.520 --> 35:55.720
get a little like, hello, hello, like click into it or I can, I don't use a walkie talkie in real

35:55.720 --> 36:02.280
life, but you just click the button and you talk into it. Yeah. Hello. Is, is anyone here? Radio

36:02.280 --> 36:09.640
silence. Okay. So get dressed, slide that walkie talkie in my back pocket. Roll alertness.

36:09.640 --> 36:19.160
Pass. 48 on a 70. When you went to grab the walkie talkie to use it, you realize that it's

36:19.160 --> 36:24.440
been moved. Like it's still on your nightstand where it was, but it's not it. Maybe it's like

36:24.440 --> 36:29.560
you sat it there when you were in bed, but when you woke up, it was just out of reach,

36:29.560 --> 36:34.840
like on the far side and you had it on the closer side. Don't like that.

36:34.840 --> 36:41.160
Can I roll like a search to see if anything else is a mess in here from when I went to sleep,

36:41.160 --> 36:44.840
anything else I would notice or is that really the only go ahead and roll search. Okay.

36:49.160 --> 36:56.040
36 70. Yes. All right. So as you're like getting ready and stuff, you realize that

36:57.080 --> 37:04.200
the front door, you locked it last night. You're positive it's unlocked. Fuck. I'm starting to get

37:04.600 --> 37:10.040
antsy, but also kind of like keep my cool. I'll pop open the front door and kind of like,

37:10.040 --> 37:15.160
as soon as you open the front door, you see the bell boy is standing there with his hand up. Like

37:15.160 --> 37:20.760
he was about to knock on the door and I'm just like, Oh, Oh, what, what crazy timing. Did you

37:20.760 --> 37:26.840
see me coming? What's going on? Hey, hi, hi, Mr. Digby. Right. Yeah. That that's me. I just

37:26.840 --> 37:31.240
wondering if you've seen Jack Russell, the boat man. You met him last night. Have you seen him

37:31.240 --> 37:36.760
around this morning? Have you been, I haven't been out of my cottage since I woke up. I just

37:36.760 --> 37:41.960
woke up just now. Oh, okay. Sorry. Oh, late riser there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well,

37:41.960 --> 37:47.800
uh, no big deal. Not an issue, but, uh, you know, he's not in his apartment, so, uh,

37:48.440 --> 37:53.160
maybe just holler. Let us know when you come up. You'll be at the main house soon for another

37:53.160 --> 37:58.280
meeting. So yeah. Yeah. If I see anything, I'll, I'll let you guys know. Okay. Thanks. I'll be on

37:58.360 --> 38:05.480
my way. Slam the door. Like what the fuck is happening when you turn around? You hear,

38:05.480 --> 38:12.280
we'll use that search roll and roll it over. You hear heavy breathing from underneath your feet.

38:12.280 --> 38:19.160
Oh God. Is it wood floor? Yeah. I like kind of skip back almost like I'm like trying to

38:19.160 --> 38:23.560
Dodge something that isn't there, but I'm like jump in the air and jump back. Is it like following me

38:23.560 --> 38:28.920
or is it still where, where the sound was emanating from? That's where it was. Hello.

38:28.920 --> 38:34.040
It is someone down there and I kind of like knock on the wood. Roll search again.

38:36.840 --> 38:41.000
Ooh, a nine on a 70. Yeah. You can definitely hear that someone's down there, but they're not

38:41.000 --> 38:45.320
responding. You can roll persuade if you want to try to like persuade them to talk to you.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.960
Yeah. I'm going to be like, Hey, don't be afraid. I'm here. Like, cause I know something fucked

38:49.960 --> 38:53.400
up is happening. So I might be worried that something fucked up is happening to this person.

38:57.640 --> 39:06.040
A crit success. 44 on a 50. Can I trust you? Jack? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, as much as you can

39:06.040 --> 39:13.080
trust anyone. I'll take it. And one of the floorboards pops up and then another one pops

39:13.080 --> 39:21.560
up and he climbs up out of the floor beneath you. Hey, um, and he looks like absolute shit.

39:21.560 --> 39:27.960
He's like sweating profusely and his face is pale white. Yeah. Digby. Right. Charles. Yeah.

39:27.960 --> 39:32.360
That's that's me. You're a, what did they tell me? You were, you're some kind of investigator,

39:32.360 --> 39:38.440
right? Yeah. Yeah. I trust you. You know what the fuck is going on? I have no idea. I have this.

39:38.440 --> 39:43.800
I take out the walkie talk. I have this. Is that yours? What, what is some, some little

39:44.440 --> 39:51.320
girl or something? Talk to me on here at one point last night. And then I fell asleep and I had all

39:51.320 --> 39:56.920
these fucked up dreams. You were there. What were we doing? We were on the canoes on the water,

39:56.920 --> 40:02.840
escaping something. I don't, I don't understand something fucked up and creepy. And then out of

40:02.840 --> 40:09.640
nowhere, we snapped into this white led room with tapes everywhere. Oh, you've been to the tape

40:09.640 --> 40:17.320
room. Yeah. I know your name was on all these tapes. There's hundreds of your name. That

40:17.320 --> 40:24.120
explains a lot. My memory is shot right now. It's all split and twine with each other. It's all

40:24.120 --> 40:31.400
coming up on its own ends and flipping around inside my brain. And then there's this and I

40:31.400 --> 40:36.760
show him my arm with like the bruise. What looks like maybe I got my blood taken or something

40:36.760 --> 40:45.080
drugged. He looks super happy and he holds up his arm. Oh mate. He reaches back down into the floor

40:45.080 --> 40:50.680
and pulls out a duffel bag and rummages around through there and grabs a syringe out. And he's

40:50.680 --> 40:55.720
like, I didn't do that to you, mate. I know I didn't, but I did do it to me. What is this?

40:56.280 --> 41:01.160
It's an inoculation. And he keeps his voice down and then he immediately realizes

41:01.720 --> 41:06.280
and he starts looking around at the corners of the room. Can I look too,

41:06.280 --> 41:08.680
to see if I see like a camera placement? Yeah, roll search.

41:12.280 --> 41:17.320
Nope. Fail. He gets really close to you and he's like, stop looking. They might be watching.

41:17.320 --> 41:22.120
Okay. I kind of stare at my feet a little bit. Let's get, ah, fuck. We gotta,

41:23.080 --> 41:29.480
we gotta get out of here. But I, oh shit, shit, shit. Do you mind if I hide out here?

41:29.480 --> 41:34.120
If you feel safer here, stay here. Are you going to fucking tell me? Are you a snitch?

41:34.120 --> 41:38.440
No, no, no, no, no. Something, something bad is happening to all of us here.

41:38.440 --> 41:42.920
I couldn't agree more. I don't know what it is, but we, we need to find out.

41:43.720 --> 41:47.720
Scream. The room explodes.

41:55.880 --> 42:02.760
You're all sitting in the meeting room that you had orientation in and it is Roger Fairfield,

42:02.760 --> 42:07.560
Angela Fairfield, Charles Digby, Mark Bradley Cooper, and,

42:08.280 --> 42:17.960
and Walter and Alan Grimes are all sitting there and the door opens and James comes in and he's

42:17.960 --> 42:23.560
like, Hey, um, real quick. Do you mind if I borrow you for just a moment, Angela, if you wouldn't

42:23.560 --> 42:28.360
mind coming on out here, I need to have a word. Is everything all right? Don't worry. It'll be

42:28.360 --> 42:33.880
fine. Uh, yeah, no, it's, uh, it's not a big deal. We just need to, Hey Angela, are you really his

42:33.960 --> 42:43.400
wife? Real human fail. He seems fine. And the explanation that he gives is valid.

42:45.640 --> 42:52.040
All right, have fun. Do they remember the reveal about Martin? Yep. He's going to act like they

42:52.040 --> 42:58.920
don't. I, yeah, I kind of want to like look and kind of be like, do you guys sleep okay?

42:59.640 --> 43:07.560
Roger perks up a little. I didn't really. Do you think maybe we all had a shared dream of some

43:07.560 --> 43:14.840
kind last night? I that's entirely possible. Walter, tell them, was it the cassette cases?

43:15.720 --> 43:24.760
Was it the canoes as well? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I also had those dreams. Do you guys have,

43:24.760 --> 43:35.000
and he like reaches out his arms. So does Roger injected. Would your wife with you? I asked if

43:35.000 --> 43:40.120
she had any weird dreams and she did, but they weren't ours. Did you look at her arm?

43:42.120 --> 43:49.320
You dumb son of a bitch. I didn't, I didn't need to look at her arm because

43:49.320 --> 43:57.960
I saw yesterday. What do you mean? What do you mean? She already, she already had a mark on her

43:57.960 --> 44:03.240
arm yesterday. I hadn't seen it before. I asked her about it. She told me it was, she and I,

44:03.240 --> 44:07.000
we travel overseas often. We have to get vaccinations. She told me it was a reaction

44:07.000 --> 44:12.200
to a vaccination, but I didn't have that reaction. Did she have it? Are you saying before you got to

44:12.200 --> 44:17.880
the campground? I mean, I noticed it when we got here. Yeah. That's weird. Do you guys all remember

44:17.880 --> 44:24.360
that I'm a billionaire? We knew, we knew that you were a villain. We did not know that you

44:24.360 --> 44:32.360
were a billionaire. Now maybe you'll treat me with the proper respect. Oh shit. You can tell

44:32.360 --> 44:38.520
by the look on Alan's face that he won't. I mean, the thought of don't forget that we,

44:38.520 --> 44:42.760
a man like Alan thinking anything about me, that doesn't move Martin.

44:42.760 --> 44:49.720
Even if you think that his son is a mechanical boy. Oh, I don't care what he thinks. I'm going

44:49.720 --> 44:59.880
to steal his son and deconstruct him at my factory. Walter, Walter says, don't forget

44:59.880 --> 45:05.560
that we can check your movements on our television. Yeah. Well, good luck with that. Is it all of us?

45:05.560 --> 45:10.200
Is it every, every cabin? I didn't see anything on my TV. I checked this morning. I also didn't

45:10.200 --> 45:19.320
find any cameras. I look at Alan and I, um, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, I've been practicing

45:19.960 --> 45:25.480
martial arts my entire adult life. We saw you do it in your bedroom the other night. I know

45:25.480 --> 45:31.480
I'm basically the wind. So if I want to be unseen, you're not going to see me understand.

45:32.120 --> 45:39.080
Did any of you, well, I was going to ask if you found cameras in your cabins, but I did. I think

45:39.080 --> 45:47.320
we know the answer. I just told you that I looked for cameras and didn't find one. I did not look

45:47.320 --> 45:53.800
for cameras. So there could be Roger. We found cameras in our cabin. Who's got your channel?

45:53.800 --> 46:05.400
Who's got our channel? Which one of you has our channel? Alan, I have something to tell you.

46:06.040 --> 46:11.880
You're not actually Alan. I brought you here with me. You're a secret government project

46:11.880 --> 46:16.040
from the late seventies. You're a clone of Donald duck and Richard Nixon.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.680
Father is that, is that,

46:23.960 --> 46:29.720
is that mostly I'll keep you around for my own amusement. Is that true? That would explain why

46:29.720 --> 46:35.240
we don't remember arriving here. I'm just fucking with them. Do you guys remember arriving?

46:36.360 --> 46:43.320
No, no, I just, I know I lost a little sanity when I thought about it in a manner of speaking.

46:43.320 --> 46:47.080
I'm kind of like freaking out a little bit now, realizing I don't actually remember

46:49.640 --> 46:56.120
saying for you, Roger Fairfield, who didn't realize that he didn't know how we got here.

46:56.680 --> 47:00.520
Of course I know how we got here. We came up the

47:00.520 --> 47:12.600
fail. Oh, you got a 97. I got a 94 dice. The two of you know innately inside of you that

47:12.600 --> 47:20.760
you have absolutely no memory of being on your way here or even a boat ride to get to this island.

47:20.760 --> 47:27.160
You have no fucking clue how you got here. Do we lose sanity? Good question.

47:27.880 --> 47:33.320
Shut the fuck up, man. Dude, don't fucking tell him who's dead.

47:33.320 --> 47:38.520
Listen guys, this might not be great news necessarily from your perspectives, but I think,

47:38.520 --> 47:43.000
I think something to keep in mind, we saw the names of a lot of famous people on those tapes,

47:43.560 --> 47:48.440
people who've gone out into the world and done things presumably after they've been here.

47:48.440 --> 47:53.720
So, you know, just try to keep your head on straight and hopefully we'll get out of this.

47:53.720 --> 47:56.920
Why did you guys come here? To work on my shit.

47:56.920 --> 47:58.440
Yeah. It was that.

47:58.440 --> 48:02.600
It was Angela's idea. She thought it would be good for our marriage.

48:02.600 --> 48:07.480
Do you remember when she posed the idea to you to come here?

48:08.280 --> 48:13.480
Yeah. I mean, we, we had a fight. She said that this would help us.

48:13.480 --> 48:19.880
That memory begins swirling around and it feels just as distant and confusing

48:20.440 --> 48:24.920
as being in the canoes or being in the room with all the shelves.

48:24.920 --> 48:31.880
Wow. You, huh, seem to start becoming pale. What is happening?

48:40.920 --> 48:43.000
It looks like you have like an eyelash in your eye.

48:44.920 --> 48:46.440
Quick, put a spoon in his mouth.

48:46.440 --> 48:50.360
You're not supposed to do that anymore.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.440
I thought it was a wallet.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.240
I put a wallet.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.880
Well, most people have a wallet. Not many people have spoons.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.000
Not in general, just on them traditionally.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.600
Bradley Cooper's wallet wouldn't fit inside of someone's because you're a villionaire.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.040
Oh my God.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.600
Billionaire. Say it.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.680
Billionaire.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.480
That's right.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.040
Yeah.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.200
I show you my slim wallet. All cards.

49:17.960 --> 49:26.040
I look over at Roger. Do you think your wife has left you here to escape or should we try to

49:26.040 --> 49:27.000
escape?

49:27.000 --> 49:32.440
That's, that's a good point. Uh, Oh God, James, James is probably in on whatever this is that's

49:32.440 --> 49:38.520
happening to us. And she's alone with him right now. Roger's going to stand up and start walking

49:38.520 --> 49:39.000
to the door.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.120
Roger, wait, wait.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.000
Hold on. We need to think.

49:41.000 --> 49:41.400
Your wife.

49:42.040 --> 49:42.680
Those tapes.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.840
She wasn't with us.

49:44.840 --> 49:47.800
They didn't, they didn't get, get, they didn't get to her.

49:47.800 --> 49:51.400
Do you remember your life with Angela before coming here?

49:51.400 --> 49:52.840
Sure. Of course.

49:52.840 --> 49:53.720
Roll sanity.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.200
Quit asking Jovia remembers things.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.600
We just sit in this room for the next 20 minutes, getting Joe down to zero.

50:04.600 --> 50:05.160
I pass.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.800
And do you love her and is she?

50:10.760 --> 50:12.920
And what is actually, how'd you guys meet?

50:12.920 --> 50:13.880
What's your middle name?

50:13.880 --> 50:16.440
Okay. So you're a human. Like you are dead.

50:16.440 --> 50:20.200
Yeah. I passed my sanity rule. So yeah. Uh, yeah, of course I remember her.

50:20.200 --> 50:26.680
Right. When Roger gets up, I look at Alan wanting to follow after Roger, but I,

50:26.680 --> 50:28.360
what kind of a look do I get from Alan?

50:28.360 --> 50:34.600
Uh, wide-eyed and confused. He is still wondering if he is a Silicon Valley project created

50:34.600 --> 50:35.480
by Bradley Cooper.

50:37.000 --> 50:37.800
You'll never know.

50:38.360 --> 50:45.000
I go over to, um, Alan, I reach under his chin and press up.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.120
Oh, that's my tongue.

50:46.120 --> 50:47.480
I think that you're okay.

50:47.480 --> 50:51.320
I go over to the robot boy and I do the same thing.

50:51.320 --> 50:58.200
My like Husky blue eye, blue gray eyes, black.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.720
And I am still.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.280
Luke, take off your headphones and plug up those ears.

51:05.240 --> 51:07.240
I found the factory reset on this freak.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.040
I think Rogers freaked out. What the fuck?

51:11.080 --> 51:13.720
Don't you remember from the dream? He's a mechanical boy.

51:13.720 --> 51:16.440
That was an idea you floated out of fucking insanity.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.800
That's not a real thing that could happen that the boy copped to.

51:19.800 --> 51:24.120
Hey guys, he just closes his eyes. They don't go black.

51:26.520 --> 51:29.480
Oh, so, okay. Rewind.

51:30.360 --> 51:33.960
Sorry. Oh, I was mistaken.

51:33.960 --> 51:37.320
Look, he's just closing really hard. He is a little freak.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.440
Maybe this kid's not as smart as I thought. He might not be.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.280
I knew he wasn't a mechanical boy.

51:43.960 --> 51:45.480
Trust me. We're working on that though.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.160
Maybe, maybe, maybe touch his chin again.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.600
Yeah. Turn him, turn back on.

51:50.600 --> 51:51.720
Do it in person.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.160
Somebody else can do that if they want it.

51:53.160 --> 51:53.720
It's quiet.

51:53.720 --> 51:56.520
Oh, Alan, Alan will do it. Yeah. Alan immediately.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.760
Like after you, as you guys are having this conversation, he's like, well,

51:58.760 --> 52:02.120
don't talk about my son. And he clicks underneath your chin.

52:03.160 --> 52:06.040
Alan pulls his finger away from underneath your chin.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.480
You back with us, bud?

52:07.480 --> 52:10.600
I instinctively punch Martin.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.480
Okay. That's going to be contested because he's some martial arts expert.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.440
All right. Unarmed combat.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.440
34 on a 40.

52:22.440 --> 52:23.800
75 on a 70.

52:25.560 --> 52:31.480
He's not expecting it from this like, from this deactivated robot boy.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.240
So as soon as I'm back.

52:33.240 --> 52:33.960
Roll a D4.

52:33.960 --> 52:38.520
Yeah, that's going to be easy.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.560
That's a four.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.920
No, I meant to give you the other dice.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.200
You punch him in the throat.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.040
As soon as I do it,

52:57.080 --> 53:01.560
as soon as I do it, I, I do it and I withdraw my hand.

53:01.560 --> 53:06.600
And then immediately I put my hand on his shoulder and I am not supposed to do that.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.960
I am not supposed to do that.

53:07.960 --> 53:10.280
Yeah. You're violating your prime directive kid.

53:10.840 --> 53:23.160
I am so sorry. And I get your fucking hand off me.

53:31.560 --> 54:01.160
Hey.

54:02.280 --> 54:05.160
This is real life.

54:08.360 --> 54:18.200
No matter how high you look on me, I think that you could fall.

54:20.600 --> 54:25.240
I knew I'd make you believe.

54:56.200 --> 54:59.880
I'd leave you all without me.

55:04.840 --> 55:09.320
Well, oh well, how you doin'?

55:09.320 --> 55:13.080
Now I think you could follow me.

55:14.440 --> 55:18.680
Cornered, room in at least right.

55:18.680 --> 55:28.680
Cornered, room in at least right.

55:48.680 --> 55:58.680
Cornered, room in at least right.

56:18.680 --> 56:28.680
Cornered, room in at least right.
