00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Greetings, all my wolf pups, it's your radio dad, Wolf the dog, howling at y'all from

00:07.360 --> 00:11.840
Contentions best radio show that is recorded in the basement.

00:11.840 --> 00:19.080
Tell your friends to tune in to 694.2 PTBP for all the goings on in our wonderful little

00:19.080 --> 00:21.600
town.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.880
Now let's dive right into some local news.

00:24.880 --> 00:31.640
Julie Maxwell, back from the dead, kidnapped Leo Piston and took him to Splashylvania.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.800
She shot Leo Piston at the top of the two-fanged plunge.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.920
Officer Clark Bishop was on the scene.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.240
He shot and killed Julie Maxwell.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.320
Your buddy Wolf will now ride the two-fanged plunge with a heavy, heavy heart.

00:46.320 --> 00:51.760
Now it says here the two bodies were slammed into the ground by an unseen force before

00:51.760 --> 00:52.760
disappearing.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.320
That's gotta be wrong, right?

00:55.320 --> 01:01.360
Somebody get Sam and Dean down here because that is some supernatural business.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.560
Officer John Lee Pettymore took a weird picture of the missing John Peters.

01:05.560 --> 01:11.240
If I had a dollar every time someone took a weird picture of me, I'd have zero dollars

01:11.240 --> 01:17.000
because your boy Wolf knows that cameras will steal your soul.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.120
Drew Andrews, upstanding citizen and police station secretary, translated the binary that

01:23.120 --> 01:24.960
the hooded fella gave John.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.720
It said, I killed the chief's pops, John.

01:28.720 --> 01:33.680
Sounds like this hooded boy is up to no good if you ask me.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.080
Keith is in a wheelchair, which is a damn shame because I don't think there's a single

01:38.080 --> 01:41.580
place with a wheelchair ramp in this whole town.

01:41.580 --> 01:46.220
The officers broke into a missing person's property, John Peters' storage units to

01:46.220 --> 01:50.180
be exact, and they found a whole bunch of goodies.

01:50.180 --> 01:56.020
One thing they found was so smelly, they decided not to open it until back in the police station,

01:56.020 --> 01:58.900
which makes total sense, I guess.

01:58.900 --> 02:03.300
They took everything back to the station in a U-Haul truck.

02:03.300 --> 02:08.660
In the plastic trunk, a woman's head, split in half with a small silver sphere in the

02:08.660 --> 02:12.380
middle, sat upon what was likely her own chopped up body.

02:12.380 --> 02:16.020
I'm gonna have to stop reading the news if it's all this fucked up.

02:16.020 --> 02:19.580
Your buddy Wolf is becoming scared of the dark.

02:19.580 --> 02:23.900
Which reminds me, you know, I had a weird dream last night.

02:23.900 --> 02:30.500
In the dream, I was walking my dog, Wolf, and he looked at me, and when he looked at

02:30.500 --> 02:37.780
me, he had my face, and then I looked in a mirror and I had his face.

02:37.780 --> 02:44.300
So anyway, never fear, because Contention's newest band is here with a hot one for y'all.

02:44.300 --> 03:03.580
It's Kudzu with no backbones.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.900
Okay let's do it.

03:04.900 --> 03:05.900
Did you not record that?

03:05.900 --> 03:09.260
What the fuck is wrong with you, Zach?

03:09.260 --> 03:10.260
Every opportunity.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.520
From the top.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.740
It's literally every time something good happens.

03:15.740 --> 03:20.180
Yeah, I was almost like, well maybe we should record soundcheck just in case.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.780
So you admit this is your fault?

03:22.780 --> 03:23.780
No.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.780
You sound weird now.

03:24.780 --> 03:29.060
Yeah, I think we need to go through it all again.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.340
Alright, Joe, if you could test your mic for me.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.340
Oh, no.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.340
I'm just kidding.

03:33.340 --> 03:34.340
Peep up.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.860
So, Christian, before we get started, where's the four-wheeler?

03:36.860 --> 03:37.860
We rode it back to...

03:37.860 --> 03:39.980
I rode it back shirtless to the station.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.380
Yeah, where'd you put it?

03:41.380 --> 03:42.380
Probably in evidence.

03:42.380 --> 03:45.060
I locked it up safely in a jail cell.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.060
Eat it.

03:46.060 --> 03:50.500
There would probably, there probably would be a garage on the premises just for convenience

03:50.500 --> 03:51.500
of cars.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.500
Yeah, like pretty sure.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.060
Or like even for like a stolen car situation where it's like, you know.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.060
Any of that, just a pound?

03:56.060 --> 03:57.060
A lot?

03:57.060 --> 03:58.060
It's an impound.

03:58.060 --> 03:59.060
Impound, yeah.

03:59.060 --> 04:02.540
And how did you move the 478 kilos of cocaine?

04:02.540 --> 04:03.540
In the U-Haul.

04:03.740 --> 04:06.100
And they're now in the evidence locker.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.100
Okay.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.100
478.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.100
Except for one brick.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.740
You guys asked Drew to look into a few things for you, and after you're finished up cataloging

04:13.740 --> 04:17.420
all the items in the evidence room, he gets your attention at his desk.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.420
Hey, fellas!

04:18.420 --> 04:24.220
So, I called the mill on the other side of the city where the chief's dad works, and

04:24.220 --> 04:25.820
they confirmed his passing.

04:25.820 --> 04:29.620
I tried the chief a couple more times, still no response.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.100
I also looked into Cole's orphanage.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.280
I didn't find anything about it.

04:34.280 --> 04:39.460
There seems to be no record of a place called that anywhere around contention.

04:39.460 --> 04:44.860
And then you guys asked me to find a mechanical engineer of some kind for those papers with

04:44.860 --> 04:46.340
the diagrams and scribbles?

04:46.340 --> 04:50.660
Well, I actually happen to have a knack for that kind of thinking, and it seems to me

04:50.660 --> 04:56.180
that those diagrams show at least a dozen methods to sabotage the air brakes of a tractor

04:56.180 --> 04:57.180
trailer truck.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.180
Nice work, Drew.

04:58.180 --> 05:00.000
I go and pat him on the back.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.120
He is so giddy that you've accepted his help.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.320
Uh, yeah, good work, Drew.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.400
I gotta agree.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.400
That's pretty good.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.400
Thank you.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.920
Why are you receptionist at a police department if you know of?

05:12.920 --> 05:16.880
Well, you guys have always called me the receptionist, but I'm more of the office manager around

05:16.880 --> 05:19.000
here is how I like to see myself.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
That's good.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That's good for you, Drew.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.800
What do you consider to be the difference?

05:22.800 --> 05:24.880
I like to think that I have a little bit more-

05:24.880 --> 05:26.160
Hey, Drew, you got a call, actually.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.160
Could you get that, buddy?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.600
Drew, I contentioned police department.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.000
It's just me pranking them.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Hello?

05:33.000 --> 05:37.300
God, I wish I could fart into the mic right now.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.480
We should look at surveillance footage from the station to see if we can find out more

05:41.480 --> 05:44.080
about Charles and see if we can't find his plate number.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.080
Oh, yeah, for sure.

05:45.080 --> 05:49.960
So you guys go into the surveillance room.

05:49.960 --> 05:54.360
You would see that Charles arrived in a white Toyota.

05:54.440 --> 06:00.400
Clark, you would recognize that for how drunk he seemed when he came in, he was driving

06:00.400 --> 06:01.840
this car very steadily.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.760
Actually, go ahead and roll human intelligence for me.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.760
Humant.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.240
Because we're setting the podcast in Missouri.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.240
Fail.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.240
50 on a 30.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.240
Okay.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.240
Everybody gets a plus 20 drive.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.240
What a drink.

06:19.440 --> 06:23.320
The contentioned police department wishes you to know that we do not condone drinking

06:23.320 --> 06:24.320
or driving?

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
Absolutely not.

06:25.320 --> 06:30.000
Contention doesn't have Uber, but everybody has a friend, except for Clark Bishop.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Oh.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.840
Wasn't it a white Toyota that Mildred saw?

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
Fuck, I think it was.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.840
That would make sense.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.840
So do you think it was him that loaded up the trunk and all that stuff?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.960
We should definitely find out about this guy.

06:43.960 --> 06:48.520
He seemed to, oh, I was going to say he seemed to genuinely want to find his friend, but

06:48.520 --> 06:51.600
I guess he could have just been playing up only to get the keys.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.600
That's true.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Or maybe both.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.400
I smelled the, this is Joe talking, I smelled the liquor on him, didn't I?

06:57.400 --> 06:58.400
Yes.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.280
He cleverly poured liquor all over himself.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.600
Let's go find him.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
Did we get a plate?

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
Yeah, sure.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.600
I want to run it.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.600
Okay.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.600
Run them plates fast, run them, run them.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
Those plates don't exist.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.600
Dang.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
Clever girl.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.600
Does anyone we know know about Charles?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.840
He probably lives here if he's friends with John Peters.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.240
I didn't recognize him.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.360
Did I know John at all?

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
Nope.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.280
What does a Google search for John Peters contention come up with?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.540
Some pretty weird porn.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.780
Go ahead and roll computer science for me.

07:23.780 --> 07:24.780
I've got a decent one.

07:24.780 --> 07:25.780
It's a crit fail.

07:25.780 --> 07:26.780
Oh, I thought it was good.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.780
22 on a 20.

07:27.780 --> 07:28.780
His laptop battery explodes.

07:28.780 --> 07:29.780
You guys know how to use computers.

07:29.780 --> 07:30.780
Oh, the worst crit fail.

07:30.780 --> 07:31.780
Oh, no.

07:31.780 --> 07:32.780
100.

07:32.780 --> 07:33.780
Somebody is hacking.

07:33.780 --> 07:34.780
As you search through, it seems like you hit some pages.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.780
Oh, no.

07:35.780 --> 07:36.780
Oh, no.

07:36.780 --> 07:37.780
Oh, no.

07:37.780 --> 07:38.780
Oh, no.

07:38.780 --> 07:39.780
Oh, no.

07:39.780 --> 07:40.780
Oh, no.

07:40.780 --> 07:41.780
Oh, no.

07:41.780 --> 07:42.780
Oh, no.

07:42.780 --> 07:43.780
Oh, no.

07:43.780 --> 07:44.780
Oh, no.

07:44.780 --> 07:45.780
Oh, no.

07:45.780 --> 07:46.780
Oh, no.

07:46.780 --> 07:47.780
Oh, no.

07:47.780 --> 07:48.780
Oh, no.

07:48.780 --> 07:55.700
So, it seems like you hit some pages that might have existed at one point but no longer

07:55.700 --> 07:56.700
exist.

07:56.700 --> 07:57.700
Clark, you know anything about computers?

07:57.700 --> 07:58.700
No.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
That's a younger man's game.

07:59.700 --> 08:00.700
How old are you?

08:00.700 --> 08:01.700
35.

08:01.700 --> 08:02.700
He's an old 35.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.700
I, unfortunately, have zero.

08:03.700 --> 08:13.820
Maybe we should just drive around and see if we see a white Toyota anywhere.

08:13.820 --> 08:14.820
I'm down.

08:14.860 --> 08:19.100
So, the plate not existing doesn't mean we can't put out an APB for the plate on the

08:19.100 --> 08:20.100
car.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.100
That's true.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.100
Very true.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.100
Yeah.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.100
We'll do that.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.100
All points.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.100
Bulletin.

08:26.100 --> 08:32.740
Police work, please roll law.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.400
I put that out so fast.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
Me too.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.380
You put out an accurate APB for a white Toyota with the plates that you have seen on this

08:40.380 --> 08:42.580
car in security footage.

08:42.580 --> 08:43.580
What do you want to do next?

08:44.340 --> 08:46.700
I mean, we can still drive around and look for it.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.700
Well.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.700
Or we could go...

08:48.700 --> 08:49.700
We found that...

08:49.700 --> 08:53.300
What, do we have a bunch of other leads to follow or something?

08:53.300 --> 08:57.780
We have this note here that says, the cabin is in the woods stark west from the end of

08:57.780 --> 09:00.580
the trail about two and a half miles signed by Kay.

09:00.580 --> 09:05.260
But when I was riding around with the homeless people yesterday, they were driving down like

09:05.260 --> 09:06.260
a dirt road.

09:06.260 --> 09:07.820
I don't know if you'd call it a trail.

09:07.820 --> 09:10.820
Kathy is the name of the piston wife.

09:10.820 --> 09:12.860
There's some dirt roads and trails around there.

09:13.140 --> 09:14.740
We could walk around in the woods a little bit.

09:14.740 --> 09:17.780
You want to gear up with some of the goodies we got yesterday?

09:17.780 --> 09:18.780
I think we should.

09:18.780 --> 09:20.860
Also, aren't there some woods?

09:20.860 --> 09:27.460
So the piston farm is in the southeast part of town and the far east part of the piston

09:27.460 --> 09:33.340
pig farm is where that trail that the school bus took with Keith Vigna in the back of it.

09:33.340 --> 09:37.420
And it leads off to some old unused country roads back there.

09:37.420 --> 09:43.620
There's also a place called the woods on the map, which is the woods of contention.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.420
It is on the far southwest.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.820
Okay, so let me go back.

09:47.820 --> 09:51.900
Yeah, so we found this note that says the cabin is in the woods stark west from the

09:51.900 --> 09:54.060
end of the trail about two and a half miles.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.180
I know that the woods are down in the southwest part of town.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.620
Would that be that trail you went down the other day with Kathy Piston?

10:00.620 --> 10:03.420
It would not be, because that was over on the southeast side of town.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.780
Well no, it's stark west two and a half miles from the trail.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.220
So if that's the end of her trail...

10:07.220 --> 10:08.780
That could be true.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.360
Let's check it out.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.060
Before we leave, we're on like day three of the chief being missing.

10:14.060 --> 10:17.180
So we would probably put out a bulletin for her now, right?

10:17.180 --> 10:19.740
Did nobody do that?

10:19.740 --> 10:22.980
Drew is like, oh, I've been looking tirelessly.

10:22.980 --> 10:26.380
I already told the city PD to be looking for her.

10:26.380 --> 10:27.380
I yeah.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.380
Good work Drew.

10:28.380 --> 10:33.020
He's not spending all his hours like putting up signs after work.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.820
He is a dedicated civil servant.

10:34.820 --> 10:35.820
We don't deserve him.

10:35.820 --> 10:36.820
Okay.

10:36.820 --> 10:37.820
Should we check that out then?

10:37.820 --> 10:38.820
Somebody push me.

10:38.820 --> 10:39.820
Oh yeah.

10:39.820 --> 10:41.980
Can we give him the four wheeler?

10:41.980 --> 10:42.980
Yeah.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.540
Let's take the four wheeler out.

10:44.540 --> 10:45.540
Yeah.

10:45.540 --> 10:46.540
Yeah.

10:46.540 --> 10:47.540
Yep.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.540
Awesome.

10:48.540 --> 10:53.020
And we are riding on either like wheel hub with shotguns just like propped up against

10:53.020 --> 10:54.020
our fucking knees.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.020
Yeah.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.020
It looks great.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.020
So you guys start rolling through town.

10:58.020 --> 11:01.340
I take my shirt off.

11:01.340 --> 11:02.340
In December.

11:02.340 --> 11:03.340
No.

11:03.340 --> 11:04.340
You guys ride together.

11:04.340 --> 11:07.340
I take the car and I have the trunk full of all the things we might need.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.540
Hell yeah.

11:08.540 --> 11:09.540
What would those things be?

11:09.540 --> 11:10.540
You know, some of the same.

11:10.540 --> 11:11.540
We'll figure out when we get there.

11:11.540 --> 11:14.640
Sounds good.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.780
Just maybe a quick overview.

11:16.780 --> 11:18.380
Some guns and my drone.

11:18.380 --> 11:19.380
Perfect.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.380
Maybe a grenade.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.380
Just the one.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.380
Just one grenade.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.580
An assortment of guns for any conceivable scenario.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.740
Love it.

11:26.740 --> 11:30.460
I love that.

11:30.460 --> 11:33.380
I'm a pretty easy going game master.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.620
I'm a pretty gentle handler.

11:35.620 --> 11:38.060
Well, I'll say.

11:38.060 --> 11:39.060
I'm a soft handler.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.060
Okay.

11:40.060 --> 11:46.200
So you guys make it out to the woods and you can park at the trailhead or you can actually

11:46.200 --> 11:50.300
park off the side of one of those country roads out there, which is actually closer

11:50.300 --> 11:54.660
to the X on the spot, but then you'll have to go through the woods themselves.

11:54.660 --> 11:57.580
I think we should go on the trip, park next to the trail and then we all ride the four

11:57.580 --> 11:58.580
wheeler down the trail.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.580
Okay.

11:59.580 --> 12:00.580
Okay.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.580
Perfect.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.780
So you guys are riding down the trail.

12:03.780 --> 12:04.980
Guys, take your shoes off.

12:04.980 --> 12:05.980
Keep my shirt on.

12:05.980 --> 12:06.980
I keep it on.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.980
Whatever.

12:07.980 --> 12:08.980
You pass.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.500
I flex a little bit.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.180
Every single time you guys pass a group of people, John Lee Pettymore is flexing up.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.580
Puts his sunglasses down over his head.

12:16.580 --> 12:20.060
Do you normally keep your sunglasses on the back of your head?

12:20.060 --> 12:23.660
John Lee Pettymore absolutely keeps his aviators.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.580
No, his tactical Oakleys.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.780
Yeah, absolutely.

12:28.780 --> 12:31.380
It's not even really bright out today, but they're nice.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.180
Yeah.

12:33.180 --> 12:37.480
So you may get down to the part of the trail where the X is.

12:37.480 --> 12:42.420
Is it called the trail butt or the trail because there's a trail head that starts the trail

12:42.420 --> 12:43.420
tail.

12:43.420 --> 12:44.420
What is the trail tail?

12:44.420 --> 12:45.420
The trail tail.

12:45.420 --> 12:51.860
So you guys get to the trail tail and it is a, it's a really serene view.

12:51.860 --> 12:57.460
It's a slight overlook, but the steepness is not vast.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.860
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.240
It's just a really nice view.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.100
People come out here all the time.

13:03.100 --> 13:08.560
There's an, there's a bench that sits here and there's a few picnic tables and such around

13:08.560 --> 13:09.560
the area.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.500
People camp out here every once in a while.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.680
There's a few spots for that.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.960
A few fire pits and such around the area.

13:15.960 --> 13:16.960
It's really nice.

13:16.960 --> 13:17.960
Okay.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.080
I whip my phone out and I see where West is.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.080
Let's go that way.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.080
Okay.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.080
Can we take the four wheeler through this?

13:24.080 --> 13:26.420
It's an ATV all terrain vehicle.

13:26.420 --> 13:29.520
It's an all terrain vehicle.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
And this.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.640
What's it altering?

13:31.640 --> 13:32.640
This is terrain.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
Okay.

13:33.640 --> 13:39.680
Let's, let's guys hop, hop back on and go two and a half miles stark West.

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
Yeah.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.680
Cue up the ATVs.

13:41.680 --> 13:53.960
Cut back to, uh, 20 minutes ago when I was on a prank phone call with Andy, Jesus Christ.

13:53.960 --> 13:54.960
That was totally.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
Oh boy.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.960
Yeah.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
Listeners love me.

13:57.960 --> 13:58.960
Honestly.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.960
Pretty good at it.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
I always forget.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.400
You got to talk into it.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.400
Yeah.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.400
It smells now.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.400
It's a fart mic.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
Yeah.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
You did that.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
That's for yourself.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
That's okay.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
That's why it really hurts.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.120
You and no one else.

14:15.120 --> 14:20.680
You come upon a clearing in the midst of the thick woods that is roughly 30 yards wide

14:20.680 --> 14:22.700
and 20 yards deep.

14:22.700 --> 14:28.880
The ground in this clearing is black and covered in rotted chard wood.

14:28.880 --> 14:33.160
Looks like there was a cabin here once I want to go up to the wood and take a peek

14:33.160 --> 14:34.160
around.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.160
Same.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.100
Just kind of milling around in the carnage or the charge.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.100
The Charnage.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.920
I'm going to search.

14:42.920 --> 14:43.920
Let's roll.

14:43.920 --> 14:49.020
I was meaning to ask you guys, uh, when we have the roles that all three of you would

14:49.020 --> 14:51.680
be rolling, I would be all three of you.

14:51.680 --> 14:58.400
I think the mechanic system calls for if it is a check like search where the more people

14:58.440 --> 15:02.440
the better than the person with the best score roles for the group.

15:02.440 --> 15:10.240
And if it's something like stealth where it's everybody needs to be, yeah, well then the

15:10.240 --> 15:13.720
worst person roles for the group.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.800
That's just what the mechanic system is for Delta Green.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.800
Just want to throw that out.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.440
I would, I would say situationally though, if we're like far apart and somebody, well

15:20.440 --> 15:24.520
for sure, but if the three of you were side by side, I like it and that's how we've always

15:24.520 --> 15:25.520
played pretty much right?

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
Pretty much.

15:26.840 --> 15:31.720
While we've been recording this, I've been far more consumed with making sure the story

15:31.720 --> 15:34.560
is right than whether we're playing the game correctly.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.660
Yeah, you got a lot of names in here, buddy.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.760
There's so many names.

15:38.760 --> 15:39.760
Who has the best search?

15:39.760 --> 15:40.760
Not me.

15:40.760 --> 15:41.760
Not me.

15:41.760 --> 15:42.760
And John, did you pass?

15:42.760 --> 15:43.760
Yes.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.960
As you guys are milling about the area, you would see there, there are no bits of structure

15:47.960 --> 15:49.600
that are still standing.

15:49.600 --> 15:54.440
However, it is very clear that at one point in time there was a cabin here.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.480
It burned down.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.080
The remains have been basically untouched.

15:58.080 --> 16:04.640
No one's been out here since it happened, it looks like, and John, you hear a crack

16:04.640 --> 16:08.600
about 20 yards into the thick of the woods.

16:08.600 --> 16:13.000
So shotgun level, but I'm peering straight in and focusing all my attention on that and

16:13.000 --> 16:16.080
I kind of snap and whistle to the other guys.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.080
What's going on, John?

16:17.080 --> 16:19.520
I hold a finger to my lips and point at where I heard the sound.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.120
When I see that, I go ahead and ready mine and I get my fucking, I should have named

16:23.120 --> 16:27.840
this gun my regular, tiny, super powerful gun.

16:27.840 --> 16:32.800
I kind of start backing like maybe towards some cover, like the ATV or whatever, but

16:32.800 --> 16:40.400
I say, identify yourself, silence, looking into the woods.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.400
You see no movement.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
Okay.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.760
I'm going to start walking towards where I heard the sound.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.480
I'm covering, covering him like a, like a good police boy.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.480
I don't know.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.480
Did it sound like a snap twig?

16:50.480 --> 16:51.480
A okay.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.600
Probably just an animal, but I'm going to go check it out.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.460
Are the two of you following behind John?

16:56.460 --> 16:57.600
Should somebody maybe stay behind?

16:57.600 --> 17:02.000
Here, I'll stay behind cause I'm in a wheelchair or actually I'm on an ATV I guess, but I can't

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
really walk that well.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.840
I would say, yeah, Keith is definitely still just sitting like at the edge.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.280
We are playing a fantasy game.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.280
You're right now.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
A centaur.

17:10.280 --> 17:17.720
Keith is definitely like at the edge of the clearing or sitting, sitting on the four wheeler

17:17.760 --> 17:21.560
and boom, you see a man just start running.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.400
He's sprinting back through the woods away from you.

17:24.400 --> 17:29.860
I shout at Keith on the four wheeler and like point to where I saw it and I take off straight

17:29.860 --> 17:30.860
after him.

17:30.860 --> 17:31.860
Can I see the figure?

17:31.860 --> 17:32.860
Yeah.

17:32.860 --> 17:33.860
Yeah.

17:33.860 --> 17:34.860
He's out in the open now.

17:34.860 --> 17:35.860
He is running.

17:35.860 --> 17:36.860
It's a tall lanky dude.

17:36.860 --> 17:40.040
No, he's running away from you into the woods.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.040
But he's in the open.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.040
He's just visible.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.760
So you can just see him because he's not hiding anymore.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.880
I want to do my best to go straight at him on the ATV.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.200
You rub, shout and stop.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.280
And if you, if John is taking a beeline to the guy, I'm actually kind of going more toward

17:52.280 --> 17:54.720
where he was hiding originally.

17:54.720 --> 17:58.760
I'm still kind of in pursuit, but taking the path that the guy would have taken.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.760
You know what I mean?

17:59.760 --> 18:03.680
You're going to center ball him for me.

18:03.680 --> 18:08.600
I need, um, I need John and Clark to both roll athletics for me.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.600
Pass.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.800
28 on a 50.

18:11.800 --> 18:12.800
Fail.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.120
67 on a 30.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
Okay.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
And I need Keith.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.360
He's going to do a literal drive for me.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.360
Oh my god.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.360
I'm fucking 99.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.360
Oh!

18:22.360 --> 18:23.360
Hell yes.

18:23.360 --> 18:28.000
The engine falls out.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.840
Clark as you begin running into the woods, the brush is hitting you and you're trying

18:32.840 --> 18:38.880
to fight through it, but you are not in shape and you are not in a position to be chasing

18:38.880 --> 18:45.120
after someone in this kind of terrain because you're not an all terrain man and you start

18:45.120 --> 18:51.560
falling behind, but you see John ahead of you and he is just fighting through this brush,

18:51.560 --> 18:55.440
just going hard, just running as fast as he can straight towards this guy who's running

18:55.440 --> 18:56.440
away from you.

18:56.440 --> 19:03.080
And you notice Keith flying past you in a four wheeler and smashed directly into a large

19:03.080 --> 19:05.080
tree.

19:05.080 --> 19:11.360
Keith, if you want to roll a D6 for me.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.440
It completely fucks up his other foot.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.760
It's a four.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.920
I need you to take four damage.

19:16.920 --> 19:24.840
Keith, as you drive into the tree, you brace with your feet and your left ankle that is

19:24.840 --> 19:31.600
completely swollen and wrapped probably in a boot snaps and you feel your ankle as you

19:31.600 --> 19:33.560
hear it crunch.

19:33.560 --> 19:36.280
Oh no.

19:36.280 --> 19:43.160
Leasing up my good foot.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.920
John, you're still in pursuit.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.440
Go ahead and roll another athletics check for me.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.080
Are we competing now?

19:50.080 --> 19:53.320
Oh, I failed my roll.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
He failed as well.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.320
I rolled 54.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.440
You don't catch up to him at all.

19:57.440 --> 20:02.480
You guys are both still running through, so go ahead and make another roll for me.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.160
Oh, fuck.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.160
100.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.160
Good fail.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.320
Absolutely delightful.

20:08.320 --> 20:14.320
You turn around as you hear a crash from behind you and you see Keith crash into a tree and

20:14.320 --> 20:18.640
as soon as you turn back around, a branch comes out of nowhere.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
What's it called?

20:19.640 --> 20:20.640
Clothesline.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
Yeah.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.480
You get clotheslined by a pretty hefty branch.

20:23.480 --> 20:27.000
Go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Three.

20:28.000 --> 20:36.280
Take three damage as you fall flat on your back and the figure runs off into the distance.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.720
I want to try to fire at it if I can.

20:38.720 --> 20:42.400
Take your damage real quick and then roll firearms at negative 40.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.400
Cool.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.640
39 on a...

20:47.640 --> 20:49.600
Adjusted on a 20.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.200
So you fire a couple of times into the woods.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.600
Clark, what do you want to do?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.840
So I'm probably coming up on the ATV at this point.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
Yeah.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.840
I'm seeing how I can help that.

20:57.840 --> 21:03.400
I hold my leg up and it's just my foot's just kind of flopping around.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
Oh shit.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.360
Oh Keith, can you feel that?

21:07.360 --> 21:09.040
I'm kind of in shock right now.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.240
Yeah, I bet, bud.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.680
I can tell it's going to hurt.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.160
I'm lifting him up and trying to get him onto the ATV.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.600
Yeah, you can pick him up and get him on there.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.600
Maybe you should drive.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
I don't know if I...

21:18.600 --> 21:22.200
I'm trying to put him back into the driver's seat.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.160
Get out of here, Keith.

21:26.160 --> 21:30.360
The ATV is now quite wonky as you drive him back.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.360
It's like wobbling.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.360
Yeah.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.360
It's real hard.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.360
Wiggling back and forth.

21:34.960 --> 21:41.760
At the first person we pass back on the trail, John very shamefully puts his shirt back on.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.200
Sad, John.

21:44.200 --> 21:50.960
Before we head out, is there any way we can go to see where he was running and track him?

21:50.960 --> 21:54.640
Yeah, I was going to see if I could find any, if he tore his clothing on anything, especially

21:54.640 --> 21:55.640
where he was hiding.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.200
I was wondering if he had been there for a while.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.200
There's no tracking.

21:58.200 --> 21:59.200
Would that be-

21:59.200 --> 22:00.200
Survival.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.200
Survival?

22:01.200 --> 22:02.200
Man, I didn't think that would be that useful.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.200
Okay.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
I pass.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.040
35 on a 60.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
Oh, do you have a dope survival?

22:07.040 --> 22:08.040
Awesome.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
I do not pass.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.040
I die.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.840
You fail surviving.

22:12.840 --> 22:19.440
Clark, as you look about, you find the exact large branch that had fallen on the ground

22:19.440 --> 22:23.600
that this person had stepped on to make that loud crack.

22:23.600 --> 22:29.000
And it doesn't really, it was kind of behind a pretty big log, which you think he then

22:29.000 --> 22:32.960
immediately hit the ground to hide behind before taking off.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.480
Do I see any-

22:34.480 --> 22:37.560
There are no signs that he was there for some time or anything.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.560
Racking our memories.

22:38.560 --> 22:43.600
Does this guy share a frame or any physical characteristics with anybody we know from

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
town?

22:44.600 --> 22:49.560
I think based on how shitty all those roles were, you guys were just in the panic mode

22:49.560 --> 22:50.560
and had-

22:50.560 --> 22:53.320
We might have been chasing our own shadows for all we know.

22:53.320 --> 22:54.840
You saw a flash of human.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.760
Dude, good band name.

22:56.760 --> 22:57.760
Flash of human?

22:57.760 --> 22:58.760
Oh, yeah.

22:58.760 --> 22:59.760
Oh, man.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.760
In World, flash of human is Johnny Paymore's favorite band.

23:02.760 --> 23:03.760
They were his mom's favorite band.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.560
What do you think that fella was watching us for?

23:05.560 --> 23:08.600
I don't know if he was watching us or if we spooked him.

23:08.600 --> 23:09.600
Why do you-

23:09.600 --> 23:11.600
Why was he out here though?

23:11.600 --> 23:17.920
I'm starting to think something funny is going on in contention.

23:17.920 --> 23:21.880
Yeah, you guys could have gotten some information there.

23:21.880 --> 23:22.880
Yeah.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
Fuck.

23:23.880 --> 23:29.840
I don't know about you guys, but this to me seems like perhaps a seriously blown opportunity.

23:29.840 --> 23:30.840
Yup.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.640
Yeah, you guys really fucked that up.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.120
Oh, that sucks.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.760
Well, let's go check out that orphanage I guess.

23:39.760 --> 23:43.240
You ever feel like you're just throwing the dice in life and it's not coming up?

23:43.240 --> 23:47.520
If the guy had kept running in a straight line, would I know where he would potentially

23:47.520 --> 23:48.520
come out?

23:48.520 --> 23:50.480
That's what I thought we were tracking him for, right?

23:50.480 --> 23:57.640
Yeah, and based on that, the woods, quote unquote, is an extremely large area, but it

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
is-

23:58.640 --> 23:59.640
Get your drone out.

23:59.640 --> 24:00.640
Yes.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
Good idea.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
It is surrounded-

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
Fuck you, Game Master.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
Bye.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.040
It is surrounded by roads.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.040
Great.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
Great idea, Keith.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
Yeah.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.040
And I'm good.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.040
Of where?

24:13.040 --> 24:14.040
In his backpack.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.040
It was in my backpack.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
No, it wasn't.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.200
It's the ATV's little buddy.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.040
The ATV still drives though, right?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.040
It's just wonky.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.040
It's just wonky.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.040
Let's get back-

24:23.040 --> 24:24.520
As quick as possible back to there.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
Who's driving the ATV?

24:25.520 --> 24:26.520
Not me.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.520
I'll drive.

24:27.520 --> 24:28.520
I've got a good drive.

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
I did just get fucked up.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.520
Yeah.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
Drive at negative 20 for me.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.520
Nice.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.520
Oh.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.960
Perhaps out of anger at his recent failures, perhaps out of just a desire to prove something

24:36.960 --> 24:38.360
to his dead daddy.

24:38.360 --> 24:43.560
I don't know what inspires John Boehner's foot or John Lee Pennymore.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.560
Whoops.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.560
I mean.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
Jesus, Thomas.

24:50.560 --> 24:56.560
Either way, nobody has ever driven an ATV down a dirt track better than you see an ATV

24:56.560 --> 24:57.800
driven right the fuck now.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.560
It's not like a one, but it is a six.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
Okay.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.560
Yeah.

25:01.560 --> 25:08.080
You drive rather quickly back to the trailhead and make it to your cruiser, which has the

25:08.080 --> 25:09.880
drone in the back.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.480
I pop that sucker out.

25:11.480 --> 25:16.200
I set the little screen on the trunk and I start flying that bad boy.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
Okay.

25:17.200 --> 25:21.240
Go ahead and roll computer science for me.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
Damn it.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.240
I've got zero on that.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.240
Here.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.240
How about you-

25:25.240 --> 25:26.240
No.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.240
I'll give it.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.240
I can give it a try.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.240
I think Clark is going to give it a go for a minute.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.240
Well, yeah.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
I mean-

25:31.240 --> 25:34.320
Before, as you're driving it, the two of you are watching his screen.

25:34.320 --> 25:40.560
I am very determined and clear headed as I guide it upward about 10 feet.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.560
It's above us.

25:41.560 --> 25:45.440
We're all looking at it and then it just falls.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.600
Doesn't do anything.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.120
Go ahead and make a roll for me.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.120
Yeah.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.120
He has zero.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.120
44.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
Fuck.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
Yeah.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.120
That's a crit fail.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.120
Wait, wait, wait.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.120
Okay.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.120
But how can he even roll with zero?

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
All he can do is-

25:59.120 --> 26:02.320
To see whether he crit failed is literally why I had him roll.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.600
Can you roll on a skill you don't have though?

26:04.600 --> 26:07.840
Because you could crit fail instead of just fail.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.720
I had Luke do the same thing on forensics, I think.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.960
I think maybe there's a base of 20 on that or something.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.960
No, there's a zero.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.960
Yeah.

26:14.960 --> 26:15.960
Okay.

26:15.960 --> 26:16.960
So it adds up.

26:16.960 --> 26:17.960
I've done this before.

26:17.960 --> 26:23.720
Clark, as you begin flying the drone above you, you lose control of it and it dips down

26:23.720 --> 26:26.920
and- I'm going to roll real quick.

26:26.920 --> 26:27.920
Off my list.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.800
My D20 with a list of possible outcomes for a drone failure.

26:31.800 --> 26:38.600
Clark, the drone out of your control, but technically in your control comes flying directly

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
at you.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.720
And I try and dodge it.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.560
Go ahead and roll dodge for me.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.560
Fail.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.560
It hits you directly in the chest.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.240
Oh, in the chest?

26:51.240 --> 26:52.240
Yeah.

26:52.240 --> 27:00.120
Now, guys, I don't actually know anything about drones based on what you've been imagining.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.120
How bad would this hurt?

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
Probably pretty fucking.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.420
I'm imagining a pretty medium to large sized drone.

27:05.420 --> 27:08.080
If it's going speedily, it probably doesn't feel great.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.960
Okay, go ahead and roll a D4 for me.

27:10.960 --> 27:11.960
Four.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.600
Yeah, you lose four damage.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.900
Like it shatters his collarbone.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.800
I'm looking up, here's what happens when a drone-

27:18.800 --> 27:22.720
It knocks you to the ground and cuts you up in the chest.

27:22.720 --> 27:28.240
And you get knocked to the ground and one of its propellers is caught in your uniform.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.120
Oh, fuck.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.600
We just watched a video where drone blades flew into pig flesh.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Let's see.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Did it go into it?

27:35.600 --> 27:38.400
It didn't cut it up, but it stabbed a good three inches.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.160
That's also an unshielded blade though.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.160
Yeah.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.160
Okay.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.160
Which these are all pretty much contained.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.160
That's true, actually.

27:44.160 --> 27:45.160
At least surrounded.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.160
Yeah.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.160
And it broke off inside of it, too.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.160
Oh, damn.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.480
I will say it cut your chest up pretty bad and knocked you back to the ground.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.860
And the drone falls to the ground next to you on the ground.

27:54.860 --> 27:58.640
You would all see that the propellers are massively screwed up.

27:58.640 --> 28:00.120
And being a cop is hard.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
Fuck.

28:01.120 --> 28:04.600
Dude, are you- Here, I want to first aid him.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
Oh, okay.

28:05.600 --> 28:12.080
We got a 61 on a 60.

28:12.080 --> 28:18.480
Luke off mic just shook his head and looked at Joe and shrugged his head.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.960
Luke, you go looking through the police cruiser for-

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
Keith.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.280
Keith, you go looking through the police cruiser- Thank you.

28:25.280 --> 28:30.480
... for a first aid kit of some sort and you guys did not bring one with you today.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.840
It's bizarre because normally there's one already in there.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.520
We had to make room for the guns.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.320
Some drunk cut his forehead open in the back and we had to patch him up and forgot to resupply.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.640
That's usually Tim's job.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.120
I'd pull off my uniform- Hell, yeah.

28:45.120 --> 28:49.680
... and then tie it around me very bra-like around my chest.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.080
That's incredible.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.080
What do you guys want to do now?

28:54.080 --> 28:55.080
Oh, man.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.520
That you have failed literally everything?

28:56.520 --> 28:59.880
Well, I'd like to try to fly the drone if it's not broken.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.840
It is in such disrepair that flying it would be extremely difficult.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.560
I've got drone repair.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.960
That's super handy.

29:09.960 --> 29:13.120
In this edition, it's repair drone.

29:13.120 --> 29:21.000
Oh, man, guys- Yeah, Keith starts crying because of his failures

29:21.000 --> 29:24.880
and because my leg is starting to hurt extremely bad.

29:24.880 --> 29:25.880
Yeah.

29:25.880 --> 29:29.120
I'm going to go to the- John starts crying too.

29:29.120 --> 29:35.240
I'm going to go to the hospital the second day in a row.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.840
For the same foot.

29:36.840 --> 29:41.640
The camera pans out and begins to lift on the scene and does an aerial shot-

29:41.640 --> 29:43.520
A well executed drone shot.

29:43.520 --> 29:50.320
A beautifully executed drone shot of the three of you sitting on the ground next to the police

29:50.320 --> 29:53.040
cruiser all crying.

29:53.040 --> 29:57.200
I got to call my mom.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.200
Can we take a break?

29:59.200 --> 30:02.280
Yeah, we can take a break.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.280
Oh, God.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.280
Jesus Christ.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.280
Oh, my God.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.280
That was amazing.

30:06.280 --> 30:10.600
That was the most Three Stooges things I think we've ever done.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.520
We were hitting branches and flying drones into us.

30:14.520 --> 30:19.440
I just dropped straight on the first tree.

30:19.440 --> 30:26.440
We literally just were knocking ourselves out.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.440
So what the fuck do we do now?

30:49.440 --> 31:17.440
Oh, my God.

31:17.440 --> 31:45.440
Oh, my God.

31:45.440 --> 32:14.440
Oh, my God.

32:14.440 --> 32:42.440
Oh, my God.

32:42.440 --> 33:11.440
Oh, my God.

33:12.440 --> 33:18.840
Greetings, my greasy grandkids.

33:18.840 --> 33:24.760
It's your grease granddad Wolf, the dog, and I'm here to let you all know that you can

33:24.760 --> 33:29.760
support this show and help it grow with some of that hard-earned dough.

33:29.760 --> 33:36.800
Yeah, you know that rhyme was so nice, I said it twice and make sure you go over to patreon.com

33:36.800 --> 33:38.760
slash pretending pod.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.960
The link is in the damn show notes, babies.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.720
Thanks for listening, my bacon buddies.
