00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Hello my cast and crew and adoring audience.

00:04.520 --> 00:09.720
It's your theater director that brings that sweet sweet nectar, Wolf the dog.

00:09.720 --> 00:17.540
And you know I'm blocking all the scenes here in contention from 694.2 PTBP like I always

00:17.540 --> 00:19.120
do my babies.

00:19.120 --> 00:24.080
This week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from a listener who tagged at PretendingPod on Twitter.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.320
And your buddy Wolf appreciates that so fucking much y'all.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.320
He writes.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.920
Hello Mr. Wolf.

00:30.920 --> 00:37.680
My name is Eidos Fillmore and I'm a proud but concerned resident of 45 years here in

00:37.680 --> 00:38.680
contention.

00:38.680 --> 00:43.640
First, I don't actually understand the program that follows your fine program.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.520
I have no idea.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.520
What I do have an idea about are all the pets going missing lately.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.640
Hell, the families on my block are missing the dogs and the cats.

00:53.640 --> 00:58.680
But who's the only citizen who also happens to serve on the city council to have a deputy

00:58.680 --> 01:01.880
come out and personally assist her and her stupid dog?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.840
Sir, you're a deputy.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.720
Don't you have better things to be doing?

01:05.720 --> 01:10.420
And then this fella Deputy Vigna coming home like some goddamn prodigal son.

01:10.420 --> 01:13.960
Except he ain't no prodigal and we all wish he would have stayed gone.

01:13.960 --> 01:19.880
I heard he almost laid hands on Leo Piston the day before he mysteriously goes missing.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
Hmm.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.240
Sorry for the long note, Wolf.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.240
Signed, Eidos.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.120
Damn, Eidos.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.240
You bring up some solid complaints.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.480
Maybe we should do something about these stupid coppers.

01:31.480 --> 01:36.320
From what I can tell, the hip new spot for all the cool cats in contention is in the

01:36.320 --> 01:38.680
creeks and ponds, my babies.

01:38.680 --> 01:43.280
For all you cool cats listening, you too can submit a message to be read by your old pal

01:43.280 --> 01:49.880
Wolf by tagging app pretending pod on social media or writing a five star review, screenshotting

01:49.880 --> 01:53.800
it and sending it to pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.200
But either way, isn't it about time you left us a review?

01:57.200 --> 02:00.120
You know what makes Wolf the dog feel so good.

02:00.120 --> 02:06.080
I want to bathe in your five stars, my babies, help your little wolfy boy get all squeaky

02:06.080 --> 02:07.080
clean.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.920
However, now it's time to dig up some dirt.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.380
It's the news.

02:12.380 --> 02:16.080
The officers were last seen causing a fatal car crash.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.640
A minivan was run off the road by Officer Betty Moore, a former teen sprint car racer

02:21.640 --> 02:27.720
who was banned from the circuit after an accident that left multiple bystanders hospitalized.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.320
The minivan flipped and caught fire.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.480
Officer Bishop pulled a young boy from the fiery wreckage.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.640
The boy is at the clinic in critical condition.

02:36.640 --> 02:42.880
The minivan then combusted, killing the driver and the other passenger who were both trapped

02:42.880 --> 02:44.440
in the vehicle.

02:44.440 --> 02:50.240
The vigna made it out with a concussion, a broken nose and the memories of a particularly

02:50.240 --> 02:52.920
traumatic childhood Christmas y'all.

02:52.920 --> 02:59.400
Speaking of Christmas, I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need.

02:59.400 --> 03:04.200
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree.

03:04.200 --> 03:12.080
I just want five star reviews, take just a second on iTunes, make my wish come true y'all.

03:12.080 --> 03:17.480
All I want for Christmas is kudzoo with no backbone.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.680
Who did the scoop?

03:34.680 --> 03:37.720
I have a hypothetical situation for you guys.

03:37.720 --> 03:45.480
If you had the opportunity to have this magical ability, which is anytime you were done with

03:45.480 --> 03:50.160
a piece of clothing that you were wearing, you could drop it on the floor and it would

03:50.160 --> 03:57.840
immediately be pressed and laundered and back in your chest of drawers or your closet like

03:57.840 --> 04:02.840
immediately or wherever you needed your clothes to be at that moment.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.840
But in order to get this ability, you have to fuck a corpse.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.560
Yeah, for sure. Two birds.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.560
For how long?

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
Okay, good question.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.560
To completion?

04:11.560 --> 04:14.560
No, you have to fuck a corpse for five minutes.

04:14.560 --> 04:15.560
Until it comes.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.560
You have to make a corpse come, okay.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.560
How fresh or old is the corpse?

04:21.560 --> 04:25.560
The corpse is roughly your age.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.560
When's the last time it was alive?

04:29.560 --> 04:30.560
Right, yeah.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.560
Oh, that's what you meant by fresh.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.560
Still warm?

04:34.560 --> 04:35.560
Uh, no.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.280
Like days, weeks?

04:38.280 --> 04:40.280
Like six hours.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.280
Oh, yeah, for sure.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.280
Wait, why does that matter? What if it was a day old?

04:45.280 --> 04:47.280
Still, but if it was like six weeks.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.280
Right.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
It'd be harder to do.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
Or three years.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.280
Yeah.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.280
Right, okay, well that would be much harder.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
It'd be just like bones.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.280
I don't know.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.280
Rubbing your bones.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.280
I would fuck a six hour corpse.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.280
So he was baiting us into blackmail is what that was.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.280
I have this recorded for posterity.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.280
He just has dirt on his mouth.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Is the question, I'm doing someone's laundry until they die and then I get to fuck them?

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Then yeah.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
I think a more interesting consequence is that your clothes would be perfectly folded,

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
pressed, put away, but a random person in the world's like comparable outfit just bursts

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
into flames.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Like, is gone.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Then double, yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah, I would do that.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
It's like the opposite of Tom's.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.720
Like actually every time you do it, a pair of Toms.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
Disappears.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.720
Disappears.

05:39.720 --> 05:45.120
Okay, so John, you are holding this wet black cat and you have just called it Doug and told

05:45.120 --> 05:46.480
it you would help him.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.120
I think you mean I'm holding a man.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.120
I'm holding Doug.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.760
I didn't just call this cat Doug.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.760
This is basic.

05:53.760 --> 06:10.640
You're talking to my old man.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.640
Radio?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.640
The radio turned you into this cat?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.880
Hey, I don't like, you guys see this, right?

06:16.880 --> 06:19.260
This cat is definitely, I'm talking to this cat.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.260
Is your name Doug?

06:20.260 --> 06:23.140
Yeah, that's a yes.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.520
Is your name Clark?

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
Meow, meow.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
Okay, good.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.520
We've got the twos and the twos.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.520
No.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
One is yes.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
Is two no?

06:30.520 --> 06:31.520
Meow.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.520
Is one yes?

06:32.520 --> 06:33.520
Meow.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.520
Is two yes?

06:34.520 --> 06:35.520
Meow.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.520
Meow.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.700
This is a smart cat because it's Doug.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.700
I have a quick question.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.060
Am I still at a negative 20 right now?

06:43.060 --> 06:44.060
Meow.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.500
Doug, do you know how this happened to you?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
Meow.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.700
So you could turn, you could fix it?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.180
We could help you fix it.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.180
You know how to fix it?

06:51.180 --> 06:52.180
Meow.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.220
Was that?

06:53.220 --> 06:56.420
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

06:56.420 --> 07:02.000
As you guys are talking to this cat, a crowd of people show up.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
They're standing around.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.740
A lot of them begin booing at you.

07:06.740 --> 07:10.340
Many of them have their phones up and are taking videos.

07:10.340 --> 07:15.860
And a young girl walks up to go ahead and roll luck against each other and see who rolls

07:15.860 --> 07:18.380
the lowest or goes over the most.

07:18.380 --> 07:23.820
Uh, I'd go pretty far over, 87 on a 55.

07:23.820 --> 07:26.860
I'm really far under, I've got a 12 on a 75.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.820
I got 69 on a 65.

07:29.820 --> 07:30.820
Hell yeah.

07:30.820 --> 07:37.340
A little girl walks up to John Lee Pettymore and she spits at you and a voice yells out

07:37.340 --> 07:44.260
from the crowd, yeah girl, fuck the police, uh, hey guys, uh, I think we better get out

07:44.260 --> 07:45.260
of here.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.740
And Drew jumps into the back of Officer Vigno's cruiser.

07:47.780 --> 07:51.540
Alright, come on, Doug, it's not safe for cop or beast.

07:51.540 --> 07:52.860
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

07:52.860 --> 07:54.660
I also get into my cruiser.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.860
Yeah, our cruisers are gone, right?

07:56.860 --> 07:58.940
So I get into Vigno's cruiser with Doug.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.220
I get in also.

08:00.220 --> 08:05.100
Okay, I take off, I put my lights on and honk and...

08:05.100 --> 08:07.620
What do you guys think that angry mob was about?

08:07.620 --> 08:10.100
Is it that we let that lady and those kids die?

08:10.100 --> 08:11.460
We saved one of the kids.

08:11.460 --> 08:12.460
Meow?

08:12.460 --> 08:14.500
Not let, it just happened near us.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.980
Don't worry, Doug.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.700
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

08:18.700 --> 08:19.700
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

08:19.700 --> 08:24.020
Well, that girl better be happy she did that to you, because if it was me, there'd be one

08:24.020 --> 08:25.020
more dead kid.

08:25.020 --> 08:30.300
Doug, you're gonna have to excuse Officer Vigno, he has a bizarre sense of humor.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.020
I just, I saw a lot of weird shit today, I'm just trying to make up.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.020
That's true, we all have.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.180
We're talking to a cat right now.

08:35.180 --> 08:42.820
This cat looks up at you and its eyes switch over from slits to full blown, like, black

08:42.820 --> 08:51.180
pupils and it jumps out of your hands, John, and it jumps into Clark's lap and looks back

08:51.180 --> 08:54.780
at you fearfully before its eyes move back into slits.

08:54.780 --> 08:55.780
I'd stroke him gently.

08:55.780 --> 08:56.780
It's okay, Doug.

08:56.780 --> 09:00.100
Vigno's the one saying scary shit, cat.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.780
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.500
This guy loves communism.

09:03.500 --> 09:09.140
You fellas think we should go back to the station and see if we can do some body switching?

09:09.140 --> 09:10.140
Yeah.

09:10.140 --> 09:11.140
Would you like us to switch your body?

09:11.140 --> 09:12.140
I think we have the technology.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.460
That's it.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.380
Let's go back to the station and we'll think about the angry mob later.

09:17.380 --> 09:18.380
Meow.

09:18.380 --> 09:22.620
You guys roll up to the station and outside of the police station there is a group of

09:22.620 --> 09:24.940
people holding up signs.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.140
They're walking around in a big circle and they seem to be chanting something along the

09:29.140 --> 09:37.020
lines of, our cops are crooks, our pigs are pricks, if we could choose they'd lose their

09:37.020 --> 09:38.020
dicks.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.300
Oh well shit, yikes.

09:39.300 --> 09:42.100
If only they knew that had actually happened to one of us earlier.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.340
Hey, that's not funny.

09:44.340 --> 09:49.740
There's a sign that says, justice for Tilde B in all caps.

09:49.740 --> 09:52.820
Another says, where is Leo Piston?

09:52.820 --> 09:58.300
One of the protesters is just holding up a tablet with a video of Officer Pettymore firing

09:58.300 --> 10:01.280
into the air and yelling at civilians.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.940
More signs say, that's completely taken out of context.

10:03.940 --> 10:10.740
30 people went missing in one week and they blew up Chief Cook, I say we cook up the blue.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.740
Wow.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.380
Are you proud of yourself for that one, Zach?

10:14.380 --> 10:20.340
I am so proud of myself for that.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.340
Who was Tilde B?

10:21.340 --> 10:22.900
Well, that was the girl, right?

10:22.900 --> 10:25.040
The one that shot the gun and disappeared.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
That is correct.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.040
Okay.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.040
Oh shit.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.540
The woman across the street from John Peters house's daughter.

10:29.540 --> 10:30.540
Milgram Mitchell.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.540
Milgram Mitchell.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.540
Oh it was Milgram Mitchell.

10:32.540 --> 10:37.420
If Maggie had been here, she would have been having press conferences and I guess assuring

10:37.420 --> 10:39.220
people that we had it under control.

10:39.220 --> 10:42.420
I guess we forgot the public relations part of our job.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.180
Whoever has the highest humant, who is that?

10:45.180 --> 10:46.180
Me.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.520
Can you go ahead and roll humant for me?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.380
That's a crit success.

10:50.380 --> 10:53.420
Drew is so nervous right now.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.660
He is fiddling with his thumbs.

10:55.660 --> 10:58.100
He's not holding eye contact with anyone.

10:58.100 --> 11:02.420
He's trying to avoid any conversation.

11:02.420 --> 11:05.860
Hey Drew, what's the matter?

11:05.860 --> 11:11.180
Well, just, you know, nervous we got this cat in here that's I guess supposed to be

11:11.180 --> 11:15.160
the cat of another cat and there's the people inside a cat and there's cats inside people

11:15.160 --> 11:21.980
and there was a body from old and a body from new and there's just a lot of stuff going

11:21.980 --> 11:26.480
on right now and I'm freaking out man.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.480
This is crazy.

11:27.480 --> 11:32.100
Drew, I think maybe you should go try to calm this crowd down out there.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.100
Yeah?

11:33.100 --> 11:35.400
Yeah, you're a good public speaker.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.760
Go ahead and roll persuade.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.040
That's another crit success.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.320
Do you think that'll help?

11:44.320 --> 11:50.240
Oh, that can't hurt.

11:50.240 --> 11:54.840
So you pull up into the parking lot and Drew hops out.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.960
You guys can hear him.

11:56.960 --> 12:06.080
Hello everyone, members of the, the established population of contention.

12:06.080 --> 12:11.400
I am here to tell you that nothing is wrong.

12:11.400 --> 12:19.480
Everything is fine and you're all overreacting to the truths of the universe that are real.

12:19.480 --> 12:23.760
Drew, Drew, Drew, Drew dial it back buddy, I go and grab it.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.600
What is actually happening?

12:25.600 --> 12:34.040
I fire my gun in the air a few times to distract people from...

12:34.040 --> 12:39.480
There are people just like taking videos with their cameras of all of this happening.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.320
I'm assuming you guys dip into the police station.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
Immediately.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.160
Okay, so you all run in there.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.280
Uh, Drew, that, that didn't go so well.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.320
Drew, was there a mob here when you left?

12:49.320 --> 12:52.240
No, I didn't, I didn't see one.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.240
Guys, I've been kind of overwhelmed recently and I mean, Florence hasn't checked in today

12:57.240 --> 13:03.040
at all and you know, I'd figured she'd be helping out with, I don't know, here.

13:03.040 --> 13:07.120
I grab Drew by the shoulders and I look him deep in the eye and I'm like, Drew, buddy,

13:07.120 --> 13:10.480
I need you to keep it together today.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.480
You understand?

13:14.480 --> 13:15.600
Roll human.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.240
Who's Florence?

13:17.240 --> 13:18.800
15.

13:18.800 --> 13:23.440
Florence is the police officer that works alongside you guys in contention.

13:23.440 --> 13:29.000
They typically take care of most things that are happening around the town.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.200
You rolled a 15?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.280
On a 40 or 50.

13:32.280 --> 13:42.920
Okay, so he calms down and he's like, okay, well this is, this is hard and I wanted to,

13:42.920 --> 13:48.720
you know, tell you guys over time, you know, maybe this would all kind of fade away, but

13:48.720 --> 13:53.440
and he reaches over his desk and he grabs this sheet of paper.

13:53.440 --> 14:00.480
He hands it to you guys and it says, remember to tell the guys at the top and then it lists

14:00.480 --> 14:08.360
off like 20 names as missing persons and roughly 100 phone calls about the animals in the water.

14:08.360 --> 14:13.720
There's also just a section heading called complaints and it has more tallies than you

14:13.720 --> 14:16.120
could possibly care to count.

14:16.120 --> 14:21.160
The last thing on the list just says feds left a message.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.160
Who left a message?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.160
What did the feds say?

14:23.160 --> 14:24.160
Drew?

14:24.160 --> 14:25.160
Let me find it.

14:25.160 --> 14:29.880
And he messes with the phone and you hear the voicemail come over and it's like, no

14:29.880 --> 14:34.480
new messages, all messages have been deleted.

14:34.480 --> 14:40.320
And he's like, oh shit, um, I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was.

14:40.320 --> 14:46.720
I think the general gist was like, Hey, what the fuck is going on?

14:46.720 --> 14:49.440
The news media, I don't know something.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.560
People are, guys, people are really upset.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.640
That much is apparent.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.200
How did you get so bad at your job so quickly, Drew?

14:57.200 --> 15:05.120
I've always been pretty bad at my job, but chief, don't laugh at me.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.200
Chief cookie has typically kept everything together.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.400
She keeps me on time.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.640
She keeps me keeping up with everything.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.680
She would never let it get out of hand like this.

15:13.680 --> 15:18.440
Drew, if chief were here, how do you think she would go about assuaging the fears of

15:18.440 --> 15:19.440
the public?

15:19.440 --> 15:20.440
Yeah, buddy.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.440
What would chief do?

15:21.440 --> 15:22.440
What would chief do?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.440
What would chief do?

15:23.440 --> 15:25.640
I don't know.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.200
We've never dealt with anything like this before.

15:28.200 --> 15:34.280
I think the first thing chief would tell you to do is to make yourself and us and Dr. Jacobs

15:34.280 --> 15:36.840
and that cat man, a nice hot cup of coffee.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.240
We're just going to take a step back and deal with this one thing at a time.

15:41.240 --> 15:46.040
Drew, if Florence wasn't so hilariously inept at his job, he would have kept you on that

15:46.040 --> 15:47.040
list.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.040
I know he would.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.040
You would have been on the ball.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.040
This isn't your fault.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
This is Florence's fault.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
Where is he?

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
Are you okay, John?

15:53.040 --> 15:56.200
Yeah, I mean, because I'm being nice to you?

15:56.200 --> 15:58.320
No, it's just that Florence is a woman.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
He knows that.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.680
Yeah, it's just a joke between me and Florence.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.680
Oh, does she think it's funny?

16:04.680 --> 16:05.680
You know what?

16:05.720 --> 16:07.120
I'll never stop to consider that.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.960
All right, well, maybe we'll ask her.

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
You're right.

16:11.960 --> 16:12.960
I'll just go make some coffee.

16:12.960 --> 16:17.000
And he runs into the back room and gets a pot going.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm holding Doug.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.880
I say, Doug, we've got the radio.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.160
Is that part of the process of getting you switched?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.160
Meow.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.160
Okay.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.160
Is it safe for me to touch it?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.160
Meow.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.160
Okay.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.640
I'm going to set Doug down and go back to the lockers and get the radio out.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.640
He follows you.

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
Okay.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.640
The cat follows you.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.880
I want to take the radio.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.920
The radio has a red light showing on it.

16:39.920 --> 16:45.080
I want to take the radio, go back to the cells, and set it on the outside of the cells.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.080
Okay.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.520
Mildred assuming is there.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.520
Dr. Marie Jacobs.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.520
Oh, fuck yeah.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.040
Dr. Marie Jacobs.

16:51.040 --> 16:55.320
Doc, somebody here you may or may not be happy to see.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.120
She's asleep and she kind of wakes up.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.600
I kind of gesture toward the kitten.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
Ah!

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
Oh.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.720
So he made it alive, did he?

17:04.720 --> 17:07.920
I just assumed the tar would have gotten him by now.

17:07.920 --> 17:08.920
The tar?

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
Whatever.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
Is that what you call the goo?

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
We've been calling it goo.

17:11.920 --> 17:12.920
Have we?

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
We call it goo, right?

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
I think we call it goo.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.960
I just had never heard anybody refer to it other than us.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
Yeah.

17:17.960 --> 17:18.960
How do you know about the goo?

17:18.960 --> 17:21.560
I fear I've spoken out of turn.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.560
What are you doing?

17:22.560 --> 17:25.000
Well, we're going to put your husband back in his body.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
No.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
No.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Ma'am, I know.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Why don't you want that to happen?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I want to go home.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.680
You should just let me go home with the man that I have now.

17:33.680 --> 17:37.080
We've kind of got to let your husband go home from this cat's body.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.360
You are talking like a...

17:39.360 --> 17:41.560
We'll get him switched and you can go home.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.560
Done.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
You don't have to let him come with you.

17:43.560 --> 17:47.620
It seems like this body switch has exposed some serious problems in your relationship

17:47.620 --> 17:49.720
and maybe you two have a lot to work out, you know?

17:49.720 --> 17:52.980
He can get a hotel, but he does need his body back, doctor.

17:52.980 --> 17:53.980
Can I have the radio?

17:53.980 --> 17:54.980
No.

17:54.980 --> 17:55.980
No.

17:55.980 --> 17:57.400
Why would you even think that was a possibility?

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
Why?

17:58.400 --> 17:59.400
I bought the radio.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.400
Did you want to do that to another man and cat?

18:00.400 --> 18:01.400
No.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
I wanted to do it to the same ones.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.600
Ma'am, we can't let you...

18:06.600 --> 18:10.540
I don't think there's a law on the books, but I know you can't radio your husband into

18:10.540 --> 18:13.440
a cat and keep him trapped there for the rest of his life.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.560
Like you just said, there's nothing on the books.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.520
Also, how's it going to work?

18:17.520 --> 18:20.200
Cats die within 15 years, 20 years.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.200
I haven't thought about it that much.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.200
How old's your cat?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
You know?

18:23.200 --> 18:27.760
And then, will the cat's brain die in your husband's body as he just gets older?

18:27.760 --> 18:28.960
You haven't thought about this at all, man.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.880
I certainly don't know the rules.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.560
The rules are that you can't do this.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.520
Well, I meant the rules of how long things would take to die within other bodies and

18:37.520 --> 18:38.520
what have you.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.920
I get the keys and open up the cell, get the husband out, and keep her in there and lock

18:42.920 --> 18:43.920
it back.

18:43.920 --> 18:44.920
Yeah.

18:44.920 --> 18:45.920
That can go off without much of a head show.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.920
What's he wearing?

18:46.920 --> 18:47.920
He's wearing like...

18:47.920 --> 18:50.560
He was in his underwear, and they were like SpongeBob underwear or something like that?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.160
Or maybe a cartoon cat?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.480
I hope it was a cartoon cat.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.760
I can't remember now.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.760
Underwear foreshadowing.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
Pepe Le Pew.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.760
Pepe Le Pew.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.580
He also has a black collar around his neck, and he's got dried blood kind of still around

19:03.580 --> 19:06.280
his mouth, but he's licked everything else clean.

19:06.280 --> 19:15.580
I look at Doug, and I say, Doug, if he turns on the radio, will that do it?

19:15.580 --> 19:18.200
The cat thinks for a second before saying, meow.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.620
Will that have unintended consequences, perhaps?

19:21.620 --> 19:23.280
There's only one way to find out.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.080
I don't trust this cat.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
Roll cat intelligence.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.840
I don't want to turn into a cat standing here.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
I don't either.

19:28.840 --> 19:33.960
I think, okay, I think we need to approach Dr. Jacobs with some kind of deal.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.160
We're going to have to try to persuade her to tell us how this happened and how this

19:37.160 --> 19:38.160
worked.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.240
Or we'll keep her locked here forever.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.240
That's pretty good.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.280
Yeah, hey, 30 people are missing in contention.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.760
Nobody's going to miss one more.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.840
We can go that route with it.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.000
We can go pretty dark, or we can...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.620
I wouldn't go that route.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.120
You're not...

19:52.120 --> 19:53.720
Shut up, Dr. Jacobs.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.040
30 people disappeared in contention.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.840
It would be easy for one more to go missing.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.720
Now we're trying to think of how we're going to convince you.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.720
I wouldn't.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.720
I wouldn't convince me like that.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.720
Shut up.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.320
30 people have gone missing in contention.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.320
Hey, Doc, how did this happen the first time?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.320
It just happened.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
I don't know.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
Doc, how'd it happen?

20:10.320 --> 20:11.320
What did the goo do?

20:11.320 --> 20:13.120
The goo just ran out.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.840
Followed the cat.

20:14.840 --> 20:15.840
Your husband or...

20:15.840 --> 20:17.920
Well, yeah, I guess he was a cat then.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.440
Ma'am, we will let you free right now.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.440
Okay.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.040
With your cat body, husband.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.160
Or with your man body cat.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.160
Okay.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.160
If you tell us how it happened.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.160
Wait, no, that...

20:28.160 --> 20:30.640
No, because if I tell you how it happened, you're just going to use it.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.640
I promise I won't do that.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.120
No, we're really scared to use it.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.040
We don't want to be a cat, so just tell us.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.680
That way we know to not use it.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.080
Yeah, that way we know how to not do that.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.200
Okay, which one of you has a better persuade?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
I have a 70.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.200
I have a 60.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.440
All right, roll it up, Keith.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.760
A 70 on a 70.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.200
Oh, that's a success.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.200
Yes.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
Okay.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
All right, tell us how it happened.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.680
If you promise that I get to leave with Salem.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.680
Of course, we promise.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.680
In this...

20:56.680 --> 20:58.680
Yeah, yeah, we promise.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
Okay.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.720
I turned it on and left the room.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.480
With the cat and the man in there?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.480
Yeah.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.480
What station?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.480
NPR.

21:07.480 --> 21:08.480
Okay.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.120
Uh, gross, first of all.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.520
I didn't know they let you listen to that in contingent.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.520
It's national.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.520
Well, they got some good stories on there, Jon.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.520
I mean...

21:16.520 --> 21:17.520
Clark.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
Okay, so...

21:18.520 --> 21:26.600
Let's put him and the cat in a room together and turn that radio on and leave.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.080
Do you believe her?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.080
I do.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.600
I think it's hilarious she believed us.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.920
Clark, I rolled a 70 on my persuade.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
Sometimes you just speak in mysteries, Keith.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.080
I mean, what can it hurt?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.320
Turn into a cat.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.320
I'll do it.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.320
Okay.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.320
All right.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.320
Okay.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.320
I pat him on the back.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.320
Thanks for taking this one, man.

21:47.320 --> 21:53.440
I go into the solitary confinement cell that we have, right?

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
Probably not.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
Oh, you can do the interrogation room?

21:55.440 --> 21:56.680
Yeah, the interrogation room.

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
Perfect.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.200
I bring the cat and Doug's body into the interrogation room.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.560
Me and you are on the other side of the two-way mirror.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
Yep.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.680
Clark, Clark, either way, this could go real good for us.

22:08.680 --> 22:14.920
So I'm gonna put Doug's human body in handcuffs, just, you know.

22:14.920 --> 22:15.920
Sure.

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
Oh, wait, fuck.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.920
Oh, sorry.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.760
We can also check with the cat if that what she just told us is how it happened.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.760
Oh, shit.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.760
Yeah.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.440
I've beeped in through the intercom on the two-way mirror.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.440
Hey, cat.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.760
Is what she said earlier what happened?

22:26.760 --> 22:27.760
Meow.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.760
Cool.

22:28.760 --> 22:29.760
Cool.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.760
Okay.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.560
So Doug, I need you to sit on the table and then I'm gonna have your body sit right here.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.160
Do we have any cat treats we can distract the body with?

22:36.160 --> 22:37.560
I had a toy at one point.

22:37.560 --> 22:41.360
I run out to my desk real quick, grab it out of the drawer.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.800
I come into the interrogation room and I just kind of crack the door open and toss it in

22:44.800 --> 22:45.800
and close it real quick.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.680
Then I get back behind the two-way mirror.

22:47.680 --> 22:53.520
I grab the cat toy and dangle it in front of Doug's face, Doug, the human body face.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.520
Salem.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.520
Salem's face.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.360
And then I put it on the table in front of him and then I've got the radio.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.360
It's a big radio.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.360
Like...

23:01.360 --> 23:03.360
He's dragged it into the corner.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.360
How, like...

23:04.360 --> 23:05.360
You can...

23:05.360 --> 23:06.360
Like one of those big old, like...

23:06.360 --> 23:07.360
Yeah, it's big.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.200
Like you would be able to carry it, but it would, it would be a lug.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
Yeah, it's awkward.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.200
Okay.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.200
I do that.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
Put it in the room.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.200
What light is on?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.200
Red.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.840
If I press buttons on it, does anything change?

23:18.840 --> 23:19.840
Or turn it into not dials?

23:19.840 --> 23:20.840
I peep the intercom.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.840
Uh, Keith, do you plug it in?

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
I plug it in.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.840
Red.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.840
Turn it to NPR.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.840
I turn it to NPR.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
91.1.

23:30.840 --> 23:31.840
Red.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.840
I turn it to literally every station.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
Red.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.840
Put the cat on there.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.840
I'm gonna just leave both these guys in the room for a second and leave.

23:40.840 --> 23:41.840
What do you think, Keith?

23:41.840 --> 23:42.840
I don't know what to do.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.760
Do you guys have any thoughts?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.760
The light's just red.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.160
The radio's on, though, right?

23:47.160 --> 23:48.160
Just left it on?

23:48.160 --> 23:49.160
It's on, yeah.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.680
I turned it on and pressed all the buttons, so.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.680
We got shit to do.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.520
Let's leave them in here if we fire our eyes and see if we come back with them switched.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.680
Could work.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.160
What if they switch and re-switch several times, though, and they're trapped in there?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.160
We could just ask Doug and see if it happened.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.160
Some kind of hell.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.800
You know, once we get back, we can say, hey, did you switch and switch back?

24:05.800 --> 24:07.200
Like some kind of hell.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.480
Yeah, you know, this is one of the least of my concerns at this point right now, honestly.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.480
We found Doug.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.880
Yeah, there were a lot of protesters outside, and they got angry with a bunch of hornets

24:15.880 --> 24:17.320
when I shot those bullets off, so.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.320
Should we shoot at them?

24:18.320 --> 24:19.320
No.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.560
No, I think that would only exacerbate things.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.880
Okay, how do we deal with this, then?

24:21.880 --> 24:24.520
God, if only Maggie was here.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.520
With the camera.

24:25.520 --> 24:28.120
Can you remember anything we did that made those lights turn on?

24:28.120 --> 24:33.560
The best of my recollection, every time something really fucking scary was about to happen,

24:33.560 --> 24:34.560
they turned on.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.920
Tell me a scary story.

24:35.920 --> 24:40.560
Maybe we lock them up in a cruiser, take them with us, and any time we, you know, feel the

24:40.560 --> 24:43.360
hair tingle stand up on the back of our necks, we can.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.080
What if Doug's body runs away, though?

24:45.080 --> 24:46.440
Oh, we got that toy.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.440
Oh, what if we-

24:47.440 --> 24:48.440
No, I don't.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.440
That's not letting it work.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.440
What if we try to get the doctor to do it?

24:50.440 --> 24:51.440
She probably won't do it, though.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.440
She won't do it.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.160
What if we tell her we're gonna, I don't know, threaten her to-

24:54.160 --> 24:58.440
Oh, hey, let's go ask her how, what color the light was and how, what the circumstances

24:58.440 --> 24:59.440
were that it turned on.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
There we go.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
I go back to the doctor.

25:01.440 --> 25:05.280
So tell me more about the night this happened.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.920
Didn't work, did it?

25:06.920 --> 25:09.160
I saw you bring that radio out here.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.920
I saw the light was red.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.680
Was the light not red when, uh-

25:12.680 --> 25:18.640
The light was green when I used it, and I would imagine that it won't work again until

25:18.640 --> 25:21.120
the light is green once again.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.680
Do you know how to get the light to turn green?

25:23.680 --> 25:24.680
No.

25:24.680 --> 25:28.440
You said something that stuck in my craw, and I can't remember what it was, but it was

25:28.440 --> 25:29.640
about the tar.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.480
Joe, what's in your craw, Joe?

25:31.480 --> 25:32.480
Spit it out.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.480
In real life, I swear there was something about the ooze being near the radio.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.120
Well, cause no ooze radio.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.120
There was ooze coming out of the camera.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.520
Remember the last time we took a picture?

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
It came out of the picture.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.400
It came out of the picture?

25:42.400 --> 25:46.000
Yeah, as I was holding it, it came out of the picture onto my hands.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Or I was holding it from the camera.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
So-

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
It was dripping from both.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Yeah.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.640
I don't know what to do.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.640
Yeah, I think you're right.

25:53.640 --> 25:58.000
Maybe just leave it on and see what happens when we get back some time later.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I don't know.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
I don't know if we should leave it on.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.720
Maybe we should, cause what, I mean, actually the potential consequences of that are-

26:04.720 --> 26:08.040
Yeah, but I mean, they're kind of just on all the time though, right?

26:08.960 --> 26:09.960
Radios?

26:09.960 --> 26:12.760
I mean, this isn't just a radio though.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.840
Right, but it seems like these devices have to be activated once the green light is on.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.600
So we should turn the radio off.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.280
We have to take the picture to get it to go.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.280
Yeah, that's true.

26:21.280 --> 26:24.080
I think we lock them all up in that cell.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.080
I'm sorry.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.080
This is Thomas speaking.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.120
This is John speaking.

26:27.120 --> 26:31.040
I think we should all lock them up in that cell and let them spend some quality time

26:31.040 --> 26:32.040
with each other.

26:32.040 --> 26:37.080
And Dr. Jakes seems to fucking hate that guy and I'm not a big fan of hers right now cause

26:37.120 --> 26:38.600
she's not a whole lot of help.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.360
Maybe we'll come back and they're like screaming and she's like, meow, meow.

26:42.360 --> 26:46.040
We should probably keep them in the interrogation room because the cat could probably get out

26:46.040 --> 26:47.040
of it.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.320
No, I think the cat can just have free.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.320
I like that cat.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.320
That's true.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.320
I want the cat.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.320
I want Doug.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.320
Doug.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.320
His name is Doug.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.320
His name is Doug.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.320
I want Doug to not be stuck with her.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.760
I think she might kill him.

26:57.760 --> 26:58.760
I think you're right.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.760
That's true.

26:59.760 --> 27:00.760
I think we should, yeah.

27:00.760 --> 27:05.240
Okay, so let's lock the cat man back up and then put the radio back in the-

27:05.400 --> 27:07.880
Let's put the cat man in a different cell so she can't be by it.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.040
Give him a little time apart to think about things.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.040
I like that.

27:11.040 --> 27:15.160
You can't, you can't fuck your cat man while we're gone, Dr. Jacobs.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.160
Yeah.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.440
Okay, so where is everything?

27:18.440 --> 27:20.520
You're letting Doug come with you guys.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.440
I think Doug was just going to have free rein at the station, right?

27:23.440 --> 27:24.440
Yeah.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.440
Gotcha.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.440
Doug can have free rein at the station.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.440
He could be our sidekick.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.920
Doug, do you want to be our sidekick?

27:28.920 --> 27:29.920
Meow, meow.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.920
Yeah.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.000
So Doug, you can run around the station until we get back.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.960
Oh, hey Doug, do you know anything about what's going on at the mill?

27:36.960 --> 27:38.240
Anything about the ooze?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.440
What happened to the chief?

27:39.440 --> 27:42.640
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.760
What's going on with the ooze?

27:43.760 --> 27:44.760
Meow.

27:44.760 --> 27:45.760
Oh yeah.

27:45.760 --> 27:52.080
And then the cat jumps up on the table, it like bows a little bit and then it moves its

27:52.080 --> 27:58.480
head up and then it falls on its back and it like widens its eyes really big and starts

27:58.480 --> 28:03.420
moving its paws around and then it flips back over on top of itself and then it looks right

28:03.420 --> 28:08.380
behind it and it like freaks out and jumps up in the air and then it starts running,

28:08.380 --> 28:09.380
right?

28:09.380 --> 28:15.340
And then it runs over to the sink in the kitchen that you guys have in the station and it like

28:15.340 --> 28:16.800
paws at the water.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.380
The ooze is afraid of water?

28:18.380 --> 28:19.380
Meow.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.380
Boom.

28:20.380 --> 28:21.380
That's why the animals are in the creek.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.100
The ooze is killed by water.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.100
Meow, meow.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.100
Meow, meow.

28:25.100 --> 28:28.460
We don't know, but the ooze does not lack the water.

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
Meow.

28:29.460 --> 28:33.180
So we're making a run to Walmart and getting a bunch of super soakers.

28:33.940 --> 28:34.940
Water balloons.

28:34.940 --> 28:35.940
Oh my God.

28:35.940 --> 28:36.940
Those kiddie pool.

28:36.940 --> 28:40.120
Those guys are such assholes, but maybe we have to call the contention fire department.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.340
Those pricks, every time they win softball, they're just dicks.

28:43.340 --> 28:49.260
We should issue like an announcement to the city to stay in your bathtub or a pool or

28:49.260 --> 28:53.180
you'll disappear.

28:53.180 --> 28:54.860
Or your life is forfeit.

28:54.860 --> 28:57.980
They might help with these angry mobs.

28:57.980 --> 29:01.820
No, we can't, we don't have anything we can...

29:01.820 --> 29:02.820
Sorry.

29:03.460 --> 29:08.180
You're just like crunching chips and like moving the bag around.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.180
It's impossible.

29:09.180 --> 29:16.980
Keith, I don't know how you can eat those chips at a time like this.

29:16.980 --> 29:20.020
This feels like we're moving towards a final game plan.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.020
Really?

29:21.020 --> 29:22.020
They're about to go bad.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.740
The fact that like...

29:23.740 --> 29:24.740
Keith would be eating chips.

29:24.740 --> 29:27.700
That's exactly what I was just thinking.

29:27.700 --> 29:30.460
Of course you guys are talking like, oh, it's a cat.

29:30.460 --> 29:31.460
Is it afraid of water?

29:31.460 --> 29:37.460
And you look back and Keith's just like, ah, no, no, no, that's faffenating.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.660
He's trying to fit into those pants.

29:39.660 --> 29:40.660
Oh yeah.

29:40.660 --> 29:43.260
Yeah, so what do we do with this information?

29:43.260 --> 29:44.260
Doug is the ooze.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.020
Do you know if the ooze has an intelligence?

29:47.020 --> 29:48.020
My mom, my mom, my mom.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.820
Should we go to the mill?

29:49.820 --> 29:50.820
Or James's.

29:50.820 --> 29:51.820
Oh yeah.

29:51.820 --> 29:55.700
That's where a bunch of shit went down at the last time we were together.

29:55.700 --> 29:59.140
Wait, what about John Peter's secret room or was it James's secret room?

29:59.140 --> 30:00.140
It was James's.

30:00.140 --> 30:01.140
Oh, it was James's, yeah.

30:01.140 --> 30:05.500
It was James's house, found weird writing in blood and guns all around.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
Let's go there.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.500
I didn't write down secret room in particular.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.580
I think it was just that the guy went in there and saw it all.

30:09.580 --> 30:10.580
It was James.

30:10.580 --> 30:11.900
He worked at the mill.

30:11.900 --> 30:15.860
He was last seen going into Maggie Cook's house.

30:15.860 --> 30:16.860
Which one was he?

30:16.860 --> 30:19.460
The one who ate his own foot or the chief's foot or the one who...

30:19.460 --> 30:22.020
He was first seen with a vacuum in his front yard.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.020
Yeah.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.020
Oh, he's the galoshes guy.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.020
Yep.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.020
Already.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.860
And then he was the one with the bullet in his head sitting at the dinner table.

30:28.860 --> 30:29.860
Yeah.

30:29.860 --> 30:30.860
Okay.

30:30.860 --> 30:31.860
It was James's.

30:31.860 --> 30:32.860
Doug, can you hold down the fort?

30:32.860 --> 30:33.860
Meow.

30:33.860 --> 30:34.860
Okay.

30:34.860 --> 30:35.860
We could leave him a little tray of water and...

30:35.860 --> 30:41.220
By the way, this whole time Drew is just like staring at this cat with his big ass gums

30:41.220 --> 30:42.220
hanging out.

30:42.220 --> 30:43.220
Oh, oh, oh.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.220
That's stupid for me.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.220
So rude.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.220
Hey, Drew, this is Doug.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.220
Doug, Drew.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.220
Meow.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.340
And Drew's just like, hi.

30:49.340 --> 30:52.260
His voice gets normal for a second.

30:52.260 --> 30:57.280
Drew, I know you've been through a lot today and so have we.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.520
So just look after this cat and make sure nothing happens to it, would you?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.520
Just trust us on this.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.800
I mean, have we steered you wrong yet?

31:03.800 --> 31:04.960
I will.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.160
Thank you for trusting me, Clark.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.160
You got it, bud.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
I pat him on the back.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.840
Hey, Drew, what's our secret word?

31:11.840 --> 31:12.840
Bubble gum tree.

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
Bubble gum tree.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
Yeah, bubble gum tree.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
You could have just told that to the clones.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.320
Oh, next time.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.320
I'll get it next time.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.200
And he pulls out his phone and your phone starts ringing.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.200
My phone starts ringing?

31:22.200 --> 31:23.200
And he's like, oh, okay, good.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.200
It's you.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
I answer him, bubble gum tree.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.200
You're so funny, John.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.200
Drew.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.880
Okay, let's go to James's.

31:32.880 --> 31:37.600
On your way to James the millworker's house, it's in the suburbs.

31:37.600 --> 31:42.800
And on your way there, looking up into the sky on this chilly moonlit night, you see

31:42.800 --> 31:47.640
a crop duster flying with sparkly lights all over the wings and tail.

31:48.160 --> 31:56.360
And behind it is a massive banner that reads in bright lights, contention PD equals imbeciles.

31:56.360 --> 32:00.760
I have never seen a protest get this fancy.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.400
I've never seen contention united in such a way.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.400
I know.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.240
It would be heartwarming if it wasn't a united hate of us.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.560
Fuck them.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.560
That's impressive.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.560
That's impressive, though.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.760
I got to give it up to whoever ordered that plane.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.320
Can I call Mr. Klinker?

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
Is it Harry?

32:18.000 --> 32:19.400
Can I call Harry real quick?

32:19.400 --> 32:24.800
The phone rings until you think that it's going to go to voicemail, and then it clicks

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
and you hear.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.800
Clark.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
Hey.

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
Hey, Harry.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.800
It's Clark.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.800
How you doing?

32:30.800 --> 32:31.800
I'm well.

32:31.800 --> 32:35.640
You, uh, you seen all that rabble outside?

32:35.640 --> 32:36.640
People seem pretty mad at us.

32:36.640 --> 32:37.640
You know about that?

32:37.640 --> 32:38.640
Yeah.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.360
I was hoping you might be able to put out the good word amongst the patrons there that

32:41.360 --> 32:44.560
maybe we're onto something here and have some patience for us.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.560
Hey, Officer Bishop.

32:45.560 --> 32:49.440
You know, uh, Klinker's is always a safe place for you and your kind.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.440
I dig it.

32:50.440 --> 32:51.440
I was just...

32:51.440 --> 32:53.800
I met you and, uh, the other officers.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.800
Not bishops.

32:54.800 --> 32:55.800
Oh.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.800
I hate the church.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.080
I knew what you meant, Harry.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.080
I thank you for that.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.200
I just, I just was hoping that maybe if anybody came in there and they were grumbling about

33:04.200 --> 33:07.760
all the stupid pigs and blah, blah, blah, you might tell them that we're just some good

33:07.760 --> 33:11.440
old friends of yours and that you trust us and that maybe...

33:11.440 --> 33:15.400
Gary and I have been trying to put out the word that you boys are just trying your hardest

33:15.400 --> 33:16.400
and, uh...

33:16.400 --> 33:17.400
I appreciate that.

33:17.400 --> 33:21.440
I've got an idea about another phone call we could make because I'm, I'm, this is, this

33:21.440 --> 33:22.440
seems to have been...

33:22.440 --> 33:23.440
Oh, are we still on the call?

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
Sorry, John was talking.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.440
Sorry.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.440
Uh, hey Harry.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
Hey.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.440
Tell Harry, hey.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.440
Hey, John.

33:29.440 --> 33:30.440
I mean, Clark.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.440
Tell Harry I say hi.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.440
How long have we been playing this game?

33:32.440 --> 33:33.440
Uh...

33:33.440 --> 33:34.440
Three days.

33:35.440 --> 33:40.440
Harry, I'm glad to hear that.

33:40.440 --> 33:48.440
I just, uh, just wanted to touch base with you and make sure that you knew we were doing

33:48.440 --> 33:50.440
what we can to help out the town.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.440
I appreciate that, Clark.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.440
All right, good talking.

33:54.440 --> 33:55.440
Bye.

33:55.440 --> 33:57.940
I think maybe we should make one of those calls to the pastor too.

33:57.940 --> 34:00.240
That's not me though, because I don't think he likes me that much.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.560
That's exactly what I was about to say, you ideal steamed son of a bitch.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.280
Well, he said it earlier.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.280
He did.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.280
Really?

34:06.280 --> 34:07.280
Yeah.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.280
Oh, well.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.280
Okay, edit that part out.

34:10.280 --> 34:13.280
Edit that part out, edit out the part when he said it earlier.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.280
Yeah.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.280
Hey guys, I think we should call the pastor.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.280
Just edit everything out until we're at the...

34:19.280 --> 34:21.280
Good idea, John.

34:21.280 --> 34:26.280
Yeah, that podcast was fine until that weird episode just started with him yelling.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.280
Yeah, Thomas was just yelling at everybody.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.280
Yeah, call the pastor.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.280
Oh, is it staying?

34:31.280 --> 34:32.280
Call the pastor.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.280
Okay, anyway.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.280
Who's calling the pastor?

34:35.280 --> 34:36.280
I'll call the...

34:36.280 --> 34:37.280
Yeah, Keith shouldn't call the pastor.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.280
No.

34:38.280 --> 34:39.280
I'll call the pastor.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.280
Bring, bring.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.280
Bring, bring.

34:41.280 --> 34:46.280
When you call his office and when you call his home, both calls go to voicemail.

34:46.280 --> 34:49.280
Uh, hey, pastor.

34:49.280 --> 34:54.280
Uh, this is John Lee Pettymore III from Contention PD.

34:54.280 --> 34:58.280
Uh, just wanted to talk to you when you have a moment.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.280
Please give us a call back regarding these angry mobs.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
Thank you.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.280
Bye.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.280
Have a blessed day.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.280
That was good.

35:06.280 --> 35:10.280
Anyway, I do think that the pastor organized all this trouble against us because he seems

35:10.280 --> 35:12.280
like he can get this town going.

35:12.280 --> 35:18.280
He's got the resources and Keith did so horribly insult him and steal his helmet.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.280
Let's go to James' house.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.280
Alright, let's take a break real quick.

35:28.280 --> 35:43.280
No, my penis is bigger than an eighth of an inch.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.280
I'm pretty sure.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.280
I don't think it would even be...

35:46.280 --> 35:47.280
Prove it.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.280
Yeah, prove it.

35:48.280 --> 35:57.280
He thought so hard about showing us his dick for a bit.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
Just ask around.

35:58.280 --> 36:03.280
I feel like there was a 40% chance we almost saw Luke's dick there.

36:03.280 --> 36:07.280
If I had a couple more schlitzes in me.

36:07.280 --> 36:10.280
Or a couple more inches.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.280
Okay, so you guys are...

36:13.280 --> 36:16.280
Actually, the only reason I have back problems is...

36:16.280 --> 36:20.280
Because of my massive tongue.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.280
Dude, you know how I make my penis eight inches long?

36:23.280 --> 36:26.280
I fold it in half.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.280
Gross.

36:27.280 --> 36:30.280
That would mean I have a flaccid 16 inch penis.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.280
Horribly way too long.

36:33.280 --> 36:37.280
I'm not going to try right now, but I don't think even totally soft I could fold my penis

36:37.280 --> 36:38.280
in half.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.280
Oh, well then my penis is bigger than yours.

36:41.280 --> 36:45.280
No, I just mean I don't think it would fold back on itself that much.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.280
I don't think it's pliable enough to...

36:47.280 --> 36:48.280
I think mine would.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.280
Yeah, I can do that.

36:51.280 --> 36:52.280
I can definitely do that.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.280
Can you guys go wash your hands?

36:53.280 --> 36:54.280
I can do it.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
I can do it.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.280
I folded my penis in half.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.280
Okay.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.280
I took a shower right before I came over here.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.280
It was actually really easy.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.280
I guess a soft dick is very soft.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.280
Zach, I didn't fold my penis in half.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.280
Thank you.

37:05.280 --> 37:06.280
Do it.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.280
I like to tie mine in a ribbon.

37:08.280 --> 37:12.280
So, your characters are having this conversation after...

37:12.280 --> 37:17.280
It's a good thing Clark didn't because he would have taken his hands off the wheel.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.280
Hey, I'm driving it, aren't I?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.280
It's my fucking cruiser.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.280
Well, we're in your cruiser.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.280
I don't know if you're driving.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
I think he's driving.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.280
Yeah, I think I said that I was.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.280
I was sick of you.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.280
Are you driving?

37:27.280 --> 37:28.280
Okay.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.280
Okay.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.280
And you guys are having this conversation.

37:30.280 --> 37:36.280
Clark just wrapped up a phone call and then John called the pastor twice and left a message.

37:36.280 --> 37:40.280
Guys, I don't think we can calm down this mob.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.280
We can only incite this mob.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.280
Yeah, well then what do we do?

37:45.280 --> 37:49.280
The best thing we can do is solve this case.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.280
I hadn't even thought about doing that.

37:51.280 --> 37:57.280
If we get this case cracked, get these people found, or at least some answers for the good

37:57.280 --> 38:00.280
folks at contention, I think that'll get them out of the streets.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
I agree.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.280
We can only push forward at this point.

38:03.280 --> 38:07.280
Also, we need to get Florence on the phones calling everybody who called about a lost

38:07.280 --> 38:09.280
pet and telling them to get their ass down to the creek.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.280
And also, fuck, we need to...

38:11.280 --> 38:12.280
You know what?

38:12.280 --> 38:13.280
Okay.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.280
Hold up.

38:14.280 --> 38:20.280
We talked a little bit earlier about telling everybody to get into a bathtub full of water.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.280
Oh shit, we need the feds.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.280
Yeah, we need to get like a...

38:23.280 --> 38:25.280
Because they don't trust our authority right now.

38:25.280 --> 38:29.280
But if the feds came to contention or at least issued some kind of order...

38:29.280 --> 38:33.280
If we could do like an emergency broadcast system...

38:33.280 --> 38:34.280
And it would.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.280
I mean, people do need to be in their bathtubs or in the creek.

38:36.280 --> 38:39.280
They could get in the creek with the animals and have a little animal party.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.280
Oh shit, it's December though.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.280
It's starting to turn to...

38:42.280 --> 38:45.280
You think it's going to get pretty cold in these next couple days.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.280
How about this?

38:46.280 --> 38:53.280
Let's see if we have some funds put back to buy big kiddie pools for contention.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.280
Keith, let me stop you right there.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.280
We don't have any funds allocated for that.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.280
That is not in the budget.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.280
I know how we can get some funds.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.280
What you thinking?

39:02.280 --> 39:06.280
We do have a massive stash of...

39:06.280 --> 39:07.280
Guns.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.280
And white gold, if you know what I'm talking about.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.280
Keith!

39:10.280 --> 39:12.280
We're police.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.280
With no money.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.280
I can't believe you would suggest such a thing.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.280
I'm shutting down conversation on this right now, Keith.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.280
I'm not comfortable with this.

39:19.280 --> 39:24.280
More people will die in contention than will die from cocaine overdose.

39:24.280 --> 39:29.280
So we need to not be worrying about selling cocaine tonight and we need to be solving this case.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.280
If you say so.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.280
I do say so.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.280
Speaking of which, I pull a little baggie out of my pocket and...

39:34.280 --> 39:36.280
Well, okay, pass that over here.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.280
Roll a D6.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.280
Oh my god, guys, I haven't had a joint in like three days.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.280
Three hours.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.280
Alright, you're good for three more hours.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.280
You won't have the negative 20 anymore.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.280
Do I get a bonus if I take a bump?

39:46.280 --> 39:48.280
Or what's if John Lee Pettymore is gonna take a bump?

39:48.280 --> 39:49.280
But I don't know.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.280
Yeah, you get an actual bonus.

39:51.280 --> 39:57.280
Keith, because he's only at one willpower, his cocaine habit just negates.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.280
My minus 20.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.280
So yeah, I toss the baggie over to you.

40:00.280 --> 40:03.280
Maybe I should get a malice to charm though or something.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.280
That guy never shuts up.

40:04.280 --> 40:07.280
He's just talking and talking and talking.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.280
Is he on cocaine?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.280
Four.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.280
Alright, get four willpower back.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.280
Oh, that actually really...

40:11.280 --> 40:13.280
I forgot how down on willpower it was.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.280
That helps a lot.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.280
I went from six to eight.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.280
Oh, wait.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.280
I don't know.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.280
I went from six to ten.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.280
I'm back up to one, correct?

40:20.280 --> 40:21.280
That is correct.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.280
Math.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.280
Oh, I did not...

40:23.280 --> 40:26.280
Oh, and then I regain to two hit points, right?

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
Yeah, you should be at 20 health.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.280
But I got one willpower.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.280
Cool.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
Clark.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.280
I'm stink eyeing the hell out of him from the backseat.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.280
Thank you.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.280
I don't say anything though.

40:34.280 --> 40:35.280
Okay.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.280
Because me and Keith already had our peace on that.

40:37.280 --> 40:42.280
So you guys are doing cocaine and Clark is stink eyeing you.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.880
Not speaking a word.

40:43.880 --> 40:44.880
As you guys pull up...

40:44.880 --> 40:48.280
I'm probably even doing some real passive aggressive...

40:48.280 --> 40:49.280
Bishop.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.280
Rolling eyes real hard.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.280
Hey, Bishop.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.280
Look at me, man.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.280
Tonight...

40:53.280 --> 40:54.280
Reluctantly kind of shifting on it.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.280
Tonight could be the last night of any of our lives.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.280
And there is an evil loose in contention.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.280
I mean, it's not the time for procedure, buddy.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
You know what?

41:04.280 --> 41:08.360
And this might be your argument and I can predict it and I'm on cocaine, but maybe now

41:08.360 --> 41:15.480
is exactly the time for procedure.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.680
The cocaine is going to John Lee Pennymore's head.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.680
Role playing's hard.

41:19.680 --> 41:22.960
I roll down my window.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.360
Just listen to J.J.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.360
Kale, buddy.

41:25.360 --> 41:36.800
And that plays as we pull up to James' house.

41:37.800 --> 41:42.880
Clark, just kick back and enjoy the ride, buddy, because life's not a guarantee.

41:42.880 --> 41:48.840
I look back at Clark, give him a kind of an I'm sorry look and then a wink and then sirens

41:48.840 --> 41:51.160
on speeding as fast as I can.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.720
Down the street that the house is on, where are you parking?

41:54.720 --> 41:58.760
In the yard.

41:58.760 --> 41:59.760
Describe it.

41:59.760 --> 42:05.280
I go into the driveway at an angle and just keep going all the way up to where the passenger

42:05.280 --> 42:11.240
door of the police cruiser is like you need to take a step and a half to get into the

42:11.240 --> 42:12.440
front door.

42:12.440 --> 42:17.040
I roll out of my door as the car is still moving a little bit and I preemptively fire

42:17.040 --> 42:21.000
two shots in the air to disperse any potential crowds.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.120
Okay, sounds good.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.440
People who actually do cocaine are like, you guys.

42:27.440 --> 42:33.640
The car pulls up to a very rough stop right in front of the front door.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.200
Everyone rolls out, fires two shots in the air.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.440
Oh, whoa, John, what the fuck?

42:38.440 --> 42:40.200
We're rolling, baby.

42:40.200 --> 42:44.600
Let's fucking survey the neighborhood.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.760
Like any reaction?

42:46.760 --> 42:49.360
Cocaine.

42:49.360 --> 42:53.360
As you look about the neighborhood, go ahead and roll search for me.

42:53.360 --> 42:56.760
Uh, fail, 98 on a 20.

42:56.760 --> 42:58.520
Uh, yeah, no, neighborhood is quiet.

42:58.520 --> 43:01.680
Dude, Keith and I get dope alertness bonuses.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.240
I probably just am normal.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.360
Keith gets a negative 20 to all roles.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
Gotcha.

43:06.360 --> 43:11.760
He gets to stand, he gets to stand up and talk and move around and stuff.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.480
I'm not at negative 20 still am I?

43:13.480 --> 43:14.480
Oh, that's correct.

43:14.480 --> 43:15.480
You're no longer.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.480
Because I did drugs.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.480
I am so sorry.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.760
But you're definitely not at a bonus.

43:20.760 --> 43:28.600
And the front door opens and you see an old man, a slightly bent over wearing a fancy

43:28.600 --> 43:30.280
blue three piece suit.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.280
Whoa man.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.520
I got to point my gun right at him.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.240
What are you doing in this guy's house?

43:35.240 --> 43:38.240
Answer right now.

43:38.240 --> 43:44.800
How do you know James?

43:44.800 --> 43:48.440
I shouldn't have told you his name, that gave you a valuable clue if you were trying to

43:48.440 --> 43:49.440
lie to us.

43:49.440 --> 43:50.440
I'm the...

43:50.440 --> 43:54.140
And he's having a hard time saying it because you got a gun pointed at him and he's a terrified

43:54.140 --> 43:55.140
old man.

43:55.140 --> 43:57.200
I don't see any threat so I raise the gun.

43:57.200 --> 44:01.400
As soon as you raise it, he spits out, I'm the estate salesman.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.880
Oh, hey buddy.

44:03.880 --> 44:06.320
Hey guys, he called us.

44:06.320 --> 44:07.320
Yeah, I remember.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.320
Oh.

44:08.320 --> 44:09.520
We were just goofing with you.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.680
Yeah, just new boot goofing.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.920
Oh, that was a very terrible joke.

44:13.920 --> 44:16.160
And you walk up to him, he is...

44:16.160 --> 44:17.520
We're cops, not comedians.

44:17.520 --> 44:22.920
He's holding a cane that has a big tooth on the top where he's holding it.

44:22.920 --> 44:23.920
Like a fake tooth or a...

44:23.920 --> 44:27.400
A big fake tooth, like a giant that fits his entire fist.

44:27.400 --> 44:28.880
Right, like a just molar.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.360
Yeah, it's huge and it's on top of his cane and he...

44:32.360 --> 44:34.360
Hey buddy, what's up with your tooth cane?

44:34.360 --> 44:38.840
Oh, well, my name is Randy Angst.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.040
And he hands you a card.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.600
I don't see how that...

44:41.600 --> 44:42.600
Yeah, I don't...

44:42.600 --> 44:51.560
Randy Angst, dentist, estate salesman, founder of the Contention Historical Society, lover.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.120
That last one's important.

44:53.120 --> 44:54.720
Are you hitting on us?

44:54.720 --> 44:56.360
I bet you get a lot of play.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.280
Then it's got his phone number and his email.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.280
This is his email.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.120
Hey guys, I think the founder of the Contention Historical Society might be able to give us

45:02.120 --> 45:03.120
some clues.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.440
Do we still have those pictures?

45:04.440 --> 45:05.440
Or do we have...

45:05.440 --> 45:06.440
Pictures of what?

45:06.440 --> 45:07.520
I'm talking to Zach.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.520
This is Thomas.

45:08.520 --> 45:09.520
I'm not Zach.

45:09.520 --> 45:10.520
I'm Randy.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.520
I'm sorry, Randy.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.520
I'm on a lot of cocaine.

45:12.520 --> 45:13.520
Who's Thomas?

45:13.520 --> 45:14.520
69.

45:14.520 --> 45:15.520
God.

45:15.520 --> 45:26.480
He actually rolled 69.

45:26.480 --> 45:30.320
Is it conceivable that we have copies of those pictures on our phones?

45:30.320 --> 45:35.240
I think you would absolutely have pictures of the pictures.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
Okay.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.240
Mr. Angst.

45:37.240 --> 45:38.240
Dr. Angst?

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
DDS?

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
It doesn't say DDS.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.240
It just says dentist.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.240
Nope.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
You can just call me Randy.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
Okay, Randy.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.720
These aren't real doctors.

45:45.720 --> 45:46.720
Wow.

45:46.720 --> 45:47.720
A self hating...

45:47.720 --> 45:48.720
An anti-dentite.

45:48.720 --> 45:49.720
An anti-dentite.

45:49.720 --> 45:50.720
Yeah.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.720
Yeah.

45:51.720 --> 46:05.520
Why else was surprised that the John Lee Pettymore has seen Seinfeld?

46:05.520 --> 46:06.760
You thought I came up with that?

46:06.760 --> 46:07.760
I thought you did.

46:07.760 --> 46:08.760
Oh, gosh.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
It's just a reference.

46:09.760 --> 46:13.760
I was like, shit dude, Thomas is way funnier than I thought he was.

46:14.280 --> 46:19.480
Yeah, I would have been.

46:19.480 --> 46:26.640
Randy, I've got a picture here of a strange building and some people in old time of clothes.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.880
I'm not going to say it's essential to...

46:27.880 --> 46:29.880
Do you want to come in?

46:29.880 --> 46:32.160
No.

46:32.160 --> 46:33.440
I want to show you this picture right here.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.400
There's some very spooky stuff happening inside.

46:36.400 --> 46:39.520
I think you might want to come in.

46:39.520 --> 46:44.800
I don't know if these pictures are spooky, but I can guarantee you, there's some spooky

46:44.800 --> 46:46.520
doings in this hoose.

46:46.520 --> 46:47.520
Hoose.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.200
A very old school Anglo Saxon.

46:50.200 --> 46:51.200
Thank you.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.200
Yeah.

46:52.200 --> 46:53.200
Randy.

46:53.200 --> 46:58.580
Randy, there's spooky stuff inside that house, outside that house.

46:58.580 --> 47:00.400
This whole town is beset with it.

47:00.400 --> 47:04.200
But do you recognize the building these people are standing in front of?

47:04.200 --> 47:06.920
And I show them the picture of the people in front of the jet black building.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.440
Okay, so basically that building, it's literally just a wall.

47:10.440 --> 47:11.560
It's just a black wall.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.840
You can't actually see the building at large.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.760
Do you recognize any of the people in this picture?

47:15.760 --> 47:18.440
Are they contention founders, forefathers?

47:18.440 --> 47:26.960
Well, I do see that the clothing is anachronistically correct with the time period of the founding

47:26.960 --> 47:30.200
of contention in many of these cases.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.800
As he points to some of the people.

47:31.800 --> 47:32.800
Anachronistically.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.840
It means it came from a tree.

47:34.840 --> 47:39.160
It means the time period was from a tree.

47:39.160 --> 47:40.160
It means it was wrong.

47:40.160 --> 47:41.240
It's like a family tree.

47:41.240 --> 47:46.080
Do you mean that people in this photo have clothing anachronistic to one another or to

47:46.080 --> 47:48.760
the time period of contention's founding?

47:48.760 --> 47:49.760
Both.

47:49.760 --> 47:50.760
Okay.

47:50.760 --> 47:51.760
Can you show us an example in this picture?

47:51.760 --> 47:53.360
Who's wearing clothes that they shouldn't be?

47:53.360 --> 47:58.260
These three are wearing clothes from a different time period as the rest of them.

47:58.260 --> 48:00.600
You can tell by the stitching.

48:00.600 --> 48:01.600
How different?

48:01.600 --> 48:03.640
Oh, a hundred years or so probably.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.760
This must be a reenactment of some sort.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.720
Mr. Anx, that's very helpful.

48:07.720 --> 48:08.720
Thank you.

48:08.720 --> 48:09.720
I'm a helpful guy.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.360
Just ask my lady friends.

48:11.360 --> 48:12.360
Mr. Anx.

48:12.360 --> 48:13.360
And my man friends.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.360
All right.

48:14.360 --> 48:15.360
We'll save it for NPR.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.100
Do you remember an old orphanage in town called Cole's Orphanage?

48:18.100 --> 48:19.880
Can we go inside, please?

48:19.880 --> 48:22.060
It's very cold out.

48:22.060 --> 48:23.360
You are quite old.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.360
Let's go inside.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.360
Thank you.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.300
I brush past.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.300
What is this guy's name?

48:28.300 --> 48:29.300
Randy?

48:29.300 --> 48:30.300
Randy Anx.

48:31.300 --> 48:34.020
Not waiting for him to get out of the way, I just kind of blow by him.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.020
Okay.

48:35.020 --> 48:37.780
I mean, he did just invite you in, so.

48:37.780 --> 48:38.780
Yeah.

48:38.780 --> 48:40.380
You're doing what he asked you to do.

48:40.380 --> 48:45.000
As he goes in, he kind of pats you, Clark, on the shoulder and he says, now as we're

48:45.000 --> 48:51.340
headed inside into the warmth of this nice home in this weird place, you asked about

48:51.340 --> 48:52.340
a orphanage.

48:52.340 --> 48:53.340
Yeah.

48:53.340 --> 48:55.340
It was called Cole's Orphanage.

48:55.340 --> 48:56.340
Yeah.

48:56.340 --> 48:57.340
Yeah.

48:57.340 --> 48:58.340
I remember.

48:58.380 --> 49:00.300
And he always remembers.

49:00.300 --> 49:02.020
Do you remember?

49:02.020 --> 49:03.020
Can you?

49:03.020 --> 49:04.020
Keith.

49:04.020 --> 49:05.020
Come on, buddy.

49:05.020 --> 49:06.820
That song's a little after my time.

49:06.820 --> 49:08.140
You can see he's quite old.

49:08.140 --> 49:09.940
He doesn't know September.

49:09.940 --> 49:11.700
Can you tell me a little bit about it?

49:11.700 --> 49:15.100
We talked to some folks in town who had no recollection of it.

49:15.100 --> 49:16.100
Yes.

49:16.100 --> 49:17.620
It was not around for very long.

49:17.620 --> 49:24.340
It is a little piece of trivia I keep in the back just in case someone needs to know it

49:24.340 --> 49:25.740
at trivia.

49:25.740 --> 49:26.740
What about it?

49:26.740 --> 49:27.740
What is trivial?

49:28.140 --> 49:29.140
Well, everything.

49:29.140 --> 49:30.140
It opened.

49:30.140 --> 49:31.140
It closed.

49:31.140 --> 49:32.140
How quickly?

49:32.140 --> 49:33.140
Very quickly.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.220
I would say less than a year.

49:34.220 --> 49:35.220
What year?

49:35.220 --> 49:37.580
Oh, it was 25 years ago probably.

49:37.580 --> 49:38.780
Somewhere about then.

49:38.780 --> 49:44.620
25 minus the current year equals the early 90s and age.

49:44.620 --> 49:47.660
Do you remember who opened up that place?

49:47.660 --> 49:48.660
Um.

49:48.660 --> 49:49.660
Cole.

49:49.660 --> 49:50.900
Well, no.

49:50.900 --> 49:51.900
She would have been...

49:51.900 --> 49:52.900
He would have...

49:52.900 --> 49:54.900
Either one of them would have been long dead by that point.

49:54.900 --> 49:55.900
The Coles?

49:55.900 --> 49:56.900
Yes.

49:57.060 --> 50:00.660
They were dead by the time their namesake orphanage opened up?

50:00.660 --> 50:01.660
Oh, absolutely.

50:01.660 --> 50:03.380
Who named it for them?

50:03.380 --> 50:12.060
There are many things in our town named after our founder and his wife, Silas Cole and Mary

50:12.060 --> 50:13.060
Cole.

50:13.060 --> 50:14.060
I get that.

50:14.060 --> 50:15.060
I just wondered if you know who opened it.

50:15.060 --> 50:16.060
Oh, no.

50:16.060 --> 50:17.060
I don't remember.

50:17.060 --> 50:18.060
Wasn't this town founded by beans?

50:18.060 --> 50:19.060
Well, that's a point of contention.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.060
Contention.

50:20.060 --> 50:21.060
Hell yeah.

50:21.060 --> 50:24.860
Did Silas Cole and what was his name?

50:24.860 --> 50:25.860
Was it...

50:26.820 --> 50:27.820
Cornelius?

50:27.820 --> 50:28.820
Cornelius Beans.

50:28.820 --> 50:31.900
Oh, what a mind you have on you, young sir.

50:31.900 --> 50:34.860
I read a book or two.

50:34.860 --> 50:37.240
I believe you read the right ones.

50:37.240 --> 50:40.620
Do you remember where in contention Cole's orphanage was?

50:40.620 --> 50:43.620
Well, the town has changed quite a bit since then.

50:43.620 --> 50:46.660
I don't remember where it was now.

50:46.660 --> 50:51.100
We could probably find more back at my research facility.

50:51.100 --> 50:52.700
A resource facility?

50:52.700 --> 50:53.940
Yes.

50:53.940 --> 50:57.060
It's where all of my research is hosed.

50:57.060 --> 50:58.060
Sorry.

50:58.060 --> 51:02.320
It's where all of my research is re- fuck.

51:02.320 --> 51:05.100
It's where all of my research is hosed.

51:05.100 --> 51:07.140
Try it one more time.

51:07.140 --> 51:08.260
Yes, of course.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.420
It's where all of my research is hosed.

51:11.420 --> 51:15.220
That makes sense to me.

51:15.220 --> 51:22.980
So come on in and you guys walk into this incredibly nice and clean house.

51:23.020 --> 51:26.500
And as you walk in there's a nice foyer in front of you.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.940
And then to the right there's this huge living room.

51:29.940 --> 51:37.260
And in the living room, well here in the foyer there is a statue of a man wearing a tuxedo.

51:37.260 --> 51:41.100
And also there is a suit of armor.

51:41.100 --> 51:45.780
And the helmet has been replaced with a white hard hat.

51:45.780 --> 51:48.620
In the living room there is an empty grand piano.

51:48.620 --> 51:52.960
And there's also a large oil painting of a red rose.

51:52.960 --> 51:57.100
And he brings you over to the statue of the man wearing a tuxedo.

51:57.100 --> 52:01.200
And he says, check this sweet shit out.

52:01.200 --> 52:05.520
And he grabs the statue's bow tie and flips it.

52:05.520 --> 52:11.360
And the coffee table in the living room flips over showing an enormous stash of weapons,

52:11.360 --> 52:16.280
body armor, and a long plastic tube the size of a baseball bat.

52:16.280 --> 52:24.560
And written in blood where one of the guns should be, it says, stop her.

52:24.560 --> 52:28.080
I was pointing out the large plastic tube the shape of a baseball bat.

52:28.080 --> 52:30.980
The size behind you.

52:30.980 --> 52:35.160
There is an Ozzie Smith signed baseball bat in the room that we're in.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.560
It's in a tube that size.

52:37.560 --> 52:42.000
We are also in a completely St. Louis Cardinals themed room.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Fuck yeah dude.

52:43.000 --> 52:46.320
There's an old drawing of, is that Old Bush Stadium?

52:46.320 --> 52:47.320
No.

52:47.320 --> 52:48.320
No that's New Bush.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.320
That's New Bush Stadium.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.800
It's a seat from Old Bush behind me.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.800
There is.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.800
Cornelius?

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
The third one.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.800
Not Cornelius, fuck.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.800
My name is Cornelius or is it?

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
Ooh.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.800
Uh, guys.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.800
Wait, is your name not Randy?

52:59.800 --> 53:00.800
No, it's Randy.

53:00.800 --> 53:04.520
Randy, uh, is your middle name Cornelius?

53:04.520 --> 53:05.520
No.

53:05.520 --> 53:08.040
Is this statue of somebody significant to the town?

53:08.040 --> 53:09.960
No, I don't know who this is.

53:09.960 --> 53:12.680
Can we huddle around real quick outside of Randy?

53:12.680 --> 53:16.680
I mean, he actually, Randy can hear this, but I think we need to document this all.

53:16.680 --> 53:20.920
Take some pictures real quick with our phones and then suit the fuck up with this shit.

53:20.920 --> 53:24.400
Yeah, I'm gonna put body armor, like weapons.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.400
Let's get loaded guys.

53:25.400 --> 53:30.880
Yeah, uh, Randy, we're gonna take this for, um, you know, purposes.

53:30.880 --> 53:31.880
Vital operations.

53:31.880 --> 53:32.880
I don't think he cares.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.880
Police purposes.

53:33.880 --> 53:34.880
Hey, the estate will be compensated.

53:34.880 --> 53:39.520
Honestly, hey, you know what Randy, I don't think this is in his will so that's why you

53:39.520 --> 53:40.520
called us, right?

53:40.520 --> 53:41.520
Oh, his will was very non-existent.

53:41.520 --> 53:42.520
Okay.

53:42.560 --> 53:43.560
Let's get into the game real quick.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.520
He did call us because he wanted to know if he could sell it all.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.520
The answer is a fucking no?

53:46.520 --> 53:47.520
Oh yeah.

53:47.520 --> 53:48.520
Hey man, I'm sorry.

53:48.520 --> 53:49.520
This is all part of an ongoing investigation.

53:49.520 --> 53:52.480
We're actually going to load some of this up in our cruiser right now so we can take

53:52.480 --> 53:54.320
it to evidence as quickly as possible.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.320
Oh no.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.320
He can sell the cool statue, buddy.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
Oh good.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.320
Hey Randy, do you like cocaine?

54:00.320 --> 54:02.320
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

54:02.320 --> 54:03.320
I think so.

54:03.320 --> 54:04.320
Yeah.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.320
Hey Keith, give him, give him some of that.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.320
Yay.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.320
Just share your cocaine.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.320
Just kidding.

54:08.320 --> 54:10.640
We are police officers of the law.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.800
Keith, this is the end of the fucking world.

54:12.800 --> 54:13.800
Give him some cocaine.

54:13.800 --> 54:14.800
Wait.

54:14.800 --> 54:15.800
You know what I mean?

54:15.800 --> 54:16.800
It's the what?

54:16.800 --> 54:17.800
Nothing.

54:17.800 --> 54:18.800
I feel fine.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.000
You're going to feel a lot more fine if Keith would learn to share.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.840
Five o'clock TV hour.

54:22.840 --> 54:24.520
You know what?

54:24.520 --> 54:29.520
It's probably past my years to do an upper like cocaine.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.920
It might stop my heart.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.000
It says lover on this card.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Yes.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.200
That says to me that you do cocaine.

54:35.200 --> 54:38.880
Do you know if cocaine reacts poorly with Cialis?

54:38.880 --> 54:41.480
Oh you want Cialis right now?

54:41.480 --> 54:42.480
I'll never not.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.840
Don't you see his raging erection under his very loose pants?

54:45.840 --> 54:48.000
It says lover right there on the card.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.480
There is a full blown sideways tint going on on Randy Yanks and he immediately turns

54:54.480 --> 54:56.400
and- Randy's got nothing to be ashamed of.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.760
He turns and shows you.

54:59.760 --> 55:03.920
Is sideways tint a tint that Merlot's not allowed in?

55:03.920 --> 55:04.920
Nice dude.

55:04.960 --> 55:09.960
That scene in fucking sideways tanked the Merlot industry for like a number of years.

55:09.960 --> 55:13.080
Because they didn't explain that- It's actually because it's all his ex-wife

55:13.080 --> 55:14.080
drank.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.080
I'm fine with all varieties of red wine.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.080
Hey did you know that Randy?

55:17.080 --> 55:18.080
Randy did you know that?

55:18.080 --> 55:20.040
Merlot's my third favorite.

55:20.040 --> 55:26.640
Now we are realistically role playing cocaine.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.960
Anyway I'm- I think we should also take that oil thing.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.280
So you're saying I can't sell these guns?

55:31.280 --> 55:32.280
No.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
They're ours now.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.720
Is this the only thing you wanted us to see in this house?

55:35.720 --> 55:36.800
You said it was spooky.

55:36.800 --> 55:42.400
He walks over and grabs the- or he like reaches for the oil painting and he's like can I sell

55:42.400 --> 55:43.400
this?

55:43.400 --> 55:46.840
If you move that painting is it gonna unveil another room?

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
Another what?

55:47.840 --> 55:49.040
A secret place?

55:49.040 --> 55:50.040
Or anything?

55:50.040 --> 55:52.160
Yeah what happens when you move that painting?

55:52.160 --> 55:53.280
Why would you ask us that?

55:53.280 --> 55:55.980
Why would you want me to move- wait what is happening?

55:55.980 --> 55:56.980
Can I sell it?

55:56.980 --> 55:58.600
Why would you ask us if you can sell it?

55:58.600 --> 56:02.040
Because I'm wanting to know if all of these things are from an active crime scene or if

56:02.040 --> 56:05.920
I can sell the other stuff that isn't the guns, Keith.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.000
Oh you just got the angst.

56:14.000 --> 56:19.440
I grab one of the guns and I like am pointing at him and I'm like I don't see why you wouldn't

56:19.440 --> 56:21.520
be able to sell that painting.

56:21.520 --> 56:24.320
That's- what a weird vibe you're putting off there.

56:24.320 --> 56:29.200
You guys begin to smell the faint smell of shit.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.680
Give him some cocaine now man you made him shit his pants.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.680
Come on.

56:33.680 --> 56:34.680
I'm gonna excuse myself.

56:34.680 --> 56:37.160
Hey do you want to shoot some of these guns before we leave?

56:37.160 --> 56:39.160
Yeah do you want to do that?

56:39.160 --> 56:42.000
Yes but I do need to clean up a bit first.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
That's understandable.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
And he walks off to the bathroom.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.240
Wait wait Randy wait real fast before you leave.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.880
He pokes his head back around the corner.

56:46.880 --> 56:50.840
John did ask you like is there anything else here that you wanted us to see?

56:50.840 --> 56:54.000
What do you mean I'm just gonna point at a bunch of stuff and ask you if I can sell it

56:54.000 --> 56:55.640
as soon as I get out of the bathroom.

56:55.640 --> 56:57.220
Is anything else fucking weird?

56:57.220 --> 57:00.860
Does anything else lead to a gun door or something of that ilk?

57:00.860 --> 57:03.300
That is the only trapsie that I found.

57:03.300 --> 57:04.300
You call them trapsies?

57:04.300 --> 57:05.380
What do you call them?

57:05.380 --> 57:07.060
I've never thought of the word I would call them.

57:07.060 --> 57:08.060
Go change your fucking britches.

57:08.060 --> 57:09.060
That's just making me mad.

57:09.060 --> 57:13.880
Yeah it does smell like shit in here Randy so if you could come back we can do some cocaine.

57:13.880 --> 57:14.880
It's not my fault.

57:14.880 --> 57:15.880
And he walks away.

57:15.880 --> 57:20.380
You guys shitting himself just making me mad.

57:20.380 --> 57:26.700
This whole house smells like shit.

57:26.700 --> 57:29.020
What kind of guns are we dealing with here?

57:29.020 --> 57:30.020
Well there's that.

57:30.020 --> 57:31.020
Let's do that first.

57:31.020 --> 57:32.020
Long ones.

57:32.020 --> 57:33.020
Short ones.

57:33.020 --> 57:34.020
Fat ones.

57:34.020 --> 57:35.020
Tall ones.

57:35.020 --> 57:36.020
Red ones.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.020
Brown ones.

57:37.020 --> 57:38.020
Sad ones.

57:38.020 --> 57:39.020
Clown ones.

57:39.020 --> 57:40.020
I got sniper rifle.

57:40.020 --> 57:41.020
Assault rifle.

57:41.020 --> 57:42.020
Six pistols and four body armors.

57:42.020 --> 57:43.020
Yeah there's a bunch.

57:43.020 --> 57:44.220
Yeah there's that.

57:44.220 --> 57:47.620
Which should we let him shoot as a consolation prize for making him shoot his pants?

57:47.620 --> 57:48.620
Let's let him pick.

57:48.620 --> 57:49.620
Yeah.

57:49.620 --> 57:52.500
While they're going through the guns I want to walk over to that painting and run my hand

57:52.500 --> 57:56.060
around the edge of it and look for any kind of clicking mechanism.

57:56.420 --> 58:02.220
Oh yeah let's move everything that's as conspicuous as a tuxedo statue or a rose oil painting

58:02.220 --> 58:03.220
in this house.

58:03.220 --> 58:09.940
Like Clark you walk over to the oil painting of the rose and as you put your fingers behind

58:09.940 --> 58:14.220
it you actually feel space right behind the painting.

58:14.220 --> 58:18.380
I pull that bad bitch down off the wall.

58:18.380 --> 58:24.020
Behind the oil painting is a small hideaway big enough for one or two people.

58:24.020 --> 58:29.860
Inside there are multiple kinds of spray bottles as well as different types of gloves

58:29.860 --> 58:31.300
and materials.

58:31.300 --> 58:37.580
There's also a list and on this list is materials and those materials are inside.

58:37.580 --> 58:40.400
I got a room in here.

58:40.400 --> 58:41.780
It's got a whole bunch of stuff.

58:41.780 --> 58:46.940
It's got some tap water, some distilled water, some boiling water, some Windex, some CLR,

58:46.940 --> 58:53.660
some soap, some bleach, some vinegar, some Drano, the works, coca-cola, and oil.

58:53.660 --> 58:58.260
It's also got a whole bunch of like cotton and latex and vinyl and plastic and aluminum

58:58.260 --> 59:03.420
and neoprene and lead and salt and candy and meat and ammonium nitrate.

59:03.420 --> 59:07.060
I don't know about making bombs but...

59:07.060 --> 59:10.020
Is there a chance that neoprene isn't in here?

59:10.020 --> 59:13.320
For some reason on this list neoprene is the only thing that isn't crossed off.

59:13.320 --> 59:16.760
This is the year of the terrible neoprene shortage.

59:16.760 --> 59:17.760
What is neoprene?

59:17.760 --> 59:19.100
I don't actually know that.

59:19.100 --> 59:21.060
Neoprene is just a synthesized rubber.

59:21.960 --> 59:23.780
Let me make sure that's correct.

59:23.780 --> 59:28.980
Neoprene, also polychloroprene or PC rubber.

59:28.980 --> 59:34.020
It's a family of synthetic rubbers that are produced by polymerization of chloroprene.

59:34.020 --> 59:35.020
Cool.

59:35.020 --> 59:36.300
The more you know.

59:36.300 --> 59:40.940
Everything is labeled and there is a pair of neoprene gloves.

59:40.940 --> 59:43.300
So everything's crossed off except neoprene?

59:43.300 --> 59:44.300
Is there...

59:44.300 --> 59:46.540
I can't discern why that would be.

59:46.540 --> 59:52.200
If we do a Google search for like a number of these ingredients in concert, does a recipe

59:52.200 --> 59:53.620
or anything pop up?

59:53.620 --> 59:54.620
Nope.

59:54.620 --> 59:56.060
Do you fellas know what CLR is?

59:56.060 --> 59:57.060
Should I know what CLR is?

59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.900
It's Calcium Lime and Rust Remover.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:01.900
It gets rid of that stuff?

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.940
It gets rid of that stuff.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.940
Also the works cleans the toilet.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.100
Hey, CLR is a great product.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:10.740
All listeners of pretending to be people, if you can go down to your local Walgreens,

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.960
get some CLR, it'll clean your calcium, your lime, your rust.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.760
It's going to clean that bathtub up real good.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.440
Your sink, I think you can use it on metal too, right?

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
That's the rust part.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.840
Yeah, you got any white spots on your taps?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.800
White spots, brown spots, yellow spots, red spots.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.680
Put some CLR, mix it in with some water and just soak your shower head.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.960
Your shower head's got some calcium on there, just soak it in there for a minute.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.960
Pretending to be people.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.520
You're going to have some good water flow here in about two or three minutes.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.520
Oh, yeah.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.220
You dip your shower head in some CLR.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.220
That's a dream, man.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.220
High power.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.760
Surely it doesn't work on grease spots.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.720
Oh, but that's where you would be wrong.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.920
Can you roll to see if that all makes it in?

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920
What am I rolling against?

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.960
No, because if it shows it, I don't know what CLR is.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:58.960
It's a brain name.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.440
Yeah, and it's not necessarily something you have to know.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:09.520
Okay, also, Jon, when you Googled these ingredients, you would find out ammonium nitrate is a common

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.160
agricultural fertilizer and a deadly explosive agent.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.160
Yeah.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.320
It was used to blow up the World Trade Center the first time, I think, or was that the Oklahoma

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320
City bombing?

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.080
Hey, Clark, why do you know so much about it?

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080
I am Keith.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.080
That's Keith.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.360
I don't know anything about it.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.360
I'm a cop.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.600
I learned this in cop school.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.560
It's the one thing you remember.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.720
Making bombs was the only thing that interested you.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.720
Which one was it?

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Timothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.720
Yep, that piece of shit.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.680
Do you guys know a brand name called The Works?

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.960
Yeah, it's used to clean your toilets.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:48.160
Also if you put The Works and balls of aluminum foil in a water bottle and shake it up, you

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.000
can make a Works bomb.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.920
It's not really a bomb as much as it is.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.680
It just explodes and makes a really loud sound.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.840
It'll make the grass not grow in that spot for a couple years.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.400
Because it's full of chemicals, but yeah, the chemicals in The Works that clean your

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.280
toilet, also break the aluminum foil down into gas and then it explodes the bottle.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.440
If you put it in a two liter, it's even louder.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.560
I know this from lots of experience in Ozark, Missouri, where you do it and then you're

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.080
like, oh, we got to get out of here.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.880
And then people call the cops and you're like, you've wasted resources.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.720
My dad showed us how to do that in our backyard.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.240
It's very fun.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.000
If I wasn't a little drunk right now, I would suggest making one.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.840
Hey, listeners at home, get a two liter bottle.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.480
By this point in the podcast, we're all three beers deep.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.600
Okay, so as you guys are talking about what kind of bombs you can make with these materials.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.280
Honestly, yeah, I think it's in character.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.000
John Lee Pettymore would know right away that you can make bombs.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.480
He and Keith might even be bonding over this for the first time.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:03:01.360
And as you're bonding, Randy Angst comes caning back into the room holding his underwear aloft.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.840
Hey, Randy, could you not find a trash can, buddy?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.600
I can pull my sidearm at name and I'm like, why would you bring that in here?

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.600
Go throw it away.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.600
Oh, no.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.600
And he looks really sad.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
God damn it.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:25.560
He looks so sad and then he says, it's not my fault and walks back out of view.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:26.560
Well, that's fine.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.040
Hey, Randy, I shout down the hallway, bad news, buddy, you can't take this oil painting

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040
either.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.040
Damn it.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.360
What's the coolest gun here?

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.440
Oh, they're all pretty equal except for the sniper rifle, which should go to Clark because

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.440
he has the highest firearms.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.480
No, but I mean, just like to make up for him, you know, doing what he did.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480
Oh, well, the sniper rifle.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480
Yeah.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:50.920
I take the sniper rifle, I kick the door to the bathroom open and I hand it over to Randy

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.480
and say, here, let's go shoot this.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:04:02.320
Randy is Winnie the Pooh-ing in the bathroom, AKA he's just wearing a shirt and his vest

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.880
and his jacket and he's wearing no underwear and no pants, but his socks are showing and

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.760
he just yells at you, what are you doing?

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.480
No, I, I spent some time in the hospital recently in a gown.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.840
Don't be, don't be embarrassed.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:24.020
I've, you know, he starts peeing all over the floor and he's like, oh, actually thank

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.020
you.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:29.120
I can use it to shoot this pee for solid piss I've had in months.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.040
Oh, hey, pee is not supposed to be solid.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.700
Okay, well, uh, as soon as you get yourself cleaned up, come shoot this sniper rifle so

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.700
we can leave.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.160
You just throw it at his feet and you're like, clean yourself up.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.240
Okay, sounds good.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.280
And Clark is still looking through this room.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.980
Uh, I want to see if there's anything that isn't immediately evident.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:51.980
Search rolls.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980
Yeah.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
You can roll search.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
10.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.980
Nice.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.880
59 on a die don't pass.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.280
Ooh, I crit failed.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.280
Okay, nice.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280
99.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.880
Okay, so here I am about to open a trap door, stumble into me and break off the handle forever.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.120
You stumble into him and break his nose.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:17.100
Okay, so Keith, you come walking back into the living room, Clark and John began searching

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.100
over the house.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:24.220
John, you were in the kitchen and you actually see there's a faulty square of tiles in the

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.380
kitchen floor.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.420
What kind of tile?

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:29.600
They're like eight inch by eight inch and four of them are loose.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.640
I go lift up one of the loose tiles.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:38.040
Okay, so as you peel away these tiles, you would see that there is an empty cubicle space

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.760
right beneath you that seems to be about a foot by a foot and it looks like something

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:49.360
heavy was dragged on the tile from this spot toward the front door.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.280
Okay, I snap a picture of that and tell everybody about what I just found.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:58.260
Okay, so you're hollering about that as Clark is standing in the foyer and he's looking

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:02.420
at the suit of armor, which has this white hard hat on it.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.860
I tap on it, knock on it.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.260
That's exactly correct.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:10.340
As soon as you knock on it, I need you to roll dexterity.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.600
Oh, holy shit.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.780
Some dark soul shit hasn't happened.

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.380
I pass with a six on a 60.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:25.780
The floor drops out from underneath you and you grab onto the edge of a trap door that

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:33.580
leads to a pit beneath you and as you're holding on, you look down into the pit and you see

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.600
two dead bodies.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.900
The smell is overwhelming.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:45.660
I need you to roll sanity in order to keep holding on.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.540
I do not pass.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.740
Okay, you're going to lose one sanity.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.740
I am at 29.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.340
And now it's just me and you, Jon.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:59.580
Yeah, sorry listeners that the most capable part of this team is about to die in a pit,

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:03.340
but blame Zach.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:08.300
You fall down, however, you kind of brace yourself against the walls on either side

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.420
of you as you go down and you just barely come down a little awkward.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:18.300
You lose one hit point, but you're now 12 feet down in a pit with two dead bodies.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:23.340
One is male, one is female, but they're basically indistinguishable outside of that.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.660
Do they have clothes on?

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.660
Yes.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:30.820
I'm going to holler up, boys, I'm falling.

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.580
Well I hear all of this like happening.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:37.980
I don't see it, but I run over and I see the hole in the ground and look down and I see

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.980
him.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:42.540
Hey, uh, there's, there's bodies down here.

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.100
I'm going to, I'm going to go through the pockets.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100
Can you guys start looking at it?

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.100
Get me out of here.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.100
Yeah, dude, I can help you out.

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.100
I got an idea.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.980
This shit smells worse than Randy.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:54.980
Yeah, that's, that actually, that actually factors into my idea.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:08:01.740
Um, I get Randy's shit pants and hold onto one leg and lower the other one down that

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:02.740
hole.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:08.300
Okay, so Clark is stuck in the bottom of a viscerally foul smelling 12 foot deep pit

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:14.420
next to two corpses looking up at Keith and John, who is lowering down one pant leg of

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.100
Randy Ang's shit spoiled slacks.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:24.040
Just then a brutally loud noise erupts from outside in the front yard and items in the

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.540
house begin shattering.

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:31.940
You are being fired on by some large artillery weapon.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:37.500
Your ears are shot and your vision clouds as dust billows about the room.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:43.540
The drywall is ripped to shreds, letting cold air and moonlight into the house.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:18.900
How am I the only one trying to fool?
