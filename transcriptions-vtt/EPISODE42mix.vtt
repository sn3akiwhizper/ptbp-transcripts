Hello friends, strangers, bits of biological matter, and hitchhikers from all over the

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
galaxy.

00:12.160 --> 00:19.120
I am your guide Wolf the Dog, here to disseminate information and tips to help better your life

00:19.120 --> 00:22.080
in the vast emptiness of space.

00:22.080 --> 00:29.600
Get your towels ready, cause it's gonna be a wet one here at 694.2 PTBP, the galaxy's

00:29.600 --> 00:33.200
only holistic radio station.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.360
I hope y'all are ready to buy some of my supplements, cause we got a new Howlin' with Wolf this

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
week.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.880
This one comes from Man's Best Friend's Best Friend on Twitter, and Zach's friend Jack

00:44.880 --> 00:46.440
in real life.

00:46.440 --> 00:52.160
Note here says, your wedding reception this weekend made Zach real fuckin' happy.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.900
You two compliment each other so beautifully.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.460
He has a personal request for Wolfie.

00:57.460 --> 01:03.540
He writes, at some point in the show Zach was having a drink with 1800 and some type

01:03.540 --> 01:06.100
of seltzer or soda water I think.

01:06.100 --> 01:12.700
Problem is, I'm too lazy to go back and find the episode slash recipe lol, so I'd like

01:12.700 --> 01:19.500
to request a formalization of the drink recipe, with measurements included, read by Mr. Dog.

01:19.500 --> 01:24.100
Ooh baby, Mr. Dog, I love the ring of that.

01:24.140 --> 01:29.540
Well best friend, I'm in the delightful position of being able to deliver exactly what you

01:29.540 --> 01:30.540
request.

01:30.540 --> 01:35.940
I have here the recipe for Zach's Roleplay and Juice.

01:35.940 --> 01:43.700
It is two ounces 1800 silver tequila and one ounce Grand Marnier in a rocks filled glass

01:43.700 --> 01:50.340
with crushed ice, topped with grapefruit spindrift sparkling water, served with a lime wedge

01:50.340 --> 01:55.380
that should be promptly squeezed and muddled into the drink with dirty fingers.

01:55.380 --> 02:00.900
Enjoy the blessing and curse of being the Luis Mendoza of your roleplaying group.

02:00.900 --> 02:07.020
He's the kid from D2, The Mighty Ducks, and D3, The Mighty Ducks, who could skate real

02:07.020 --> 02:09.420
fast but could not stop.

02:09.420 --> 02:15.620
You know, people call Wolf the Luis Mendoza of radio, I uh, I don't know what it means

02:15.620 --> 02:17.620
but people keep saying it.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.340
Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to how, tag at Pretending Pod

02:22.340 --> 02:27.860

02:27.860 --> 02:32.380
and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

02:32.380 --> 02:38.020
Also get up on the contest happening over on the subreddit, r slash pretending to be

02:38.020 --> 02:43.660
people, all entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5e starter set.

02:43.660 --> 02:48.060
If anything, go check out all the brilliant entries on the thread so far, including a

02:48.060 --> 02:53.340
work of staggeringly beautiful non-fiction that depicts love between Joe Terry and his

02:53.340 --> 02:55.220
character Clark Bishop.

02:55.220 --> 02:58.660
Seriously y'all, it's there, and it's delicious.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.980
Speaking of facts, it is the news.

03:01.980 --> 03:07.620
Last time, Kathy Piston, Doug Jacobs, and the body of Agent Trent Chad, Keith Vigna,

03:07.620 --> 03:12.820
Clark Bishop, and John Lee Kevinmore did their best to survive what seemed to be an

03:12.820 --> 03:14.820
imminent demise.

03:14.820 --> 03:20.580
After a lethal contest with a human man that is also somehow seemingly part fish and a

03:20.580 --> 03:26.860
monstrous giant version of the same abomination, Keith Vigna fell asleep due to blood loss,

03:26.860 --> 03:31.360
taking us now to the darkness inside his unconscious mind.

03:31.360 --> 03:36.440
It is kudzu with no backbone.

04:01.360 --> 04:05.520
Keith, yes.

04:05.520 --> 04:11.120
In the darkness, you see a woman wearing old-timey clothing.

04:11.120 --> 04:16.000
She looks very normal, except for the hole in the middle of her head.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.940
Regardless of how she turns to look either way, you can see right through the middle

04:21.940 --> 04:25.600
of her head, and she is walking toward you.

04:25.600 --> 04:31.680
As she walks, her clothes change multiple times, as if she's in an unnatural fashion

04:31.680 --> 04:36.600
show that is moving forward in time, decade by decade.

04:36.600 --> 04:42.920
She pulls out a Zippo lighter, and as it hits the ground, you see the House of Chief Maggie

04:42.920 --> 04:45.760
Cook go up in flames.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.600
You saw this happen in the front yard, but this time, right now, you see it from the

04:50.600 --> 04:51.800
backyard.

04:51.800 --> 04:57.740
The fire spreads and explodes toward you, over you, through you, and you turn around

04:57.740 --> 05:06.240
to see these flames ignite the pond, Bean's Pond, and immediately, the water evaporates.

05:06.240 --> 05:13.300
Looking down into a dry basin filled with fish flopping their final flops, you see your

05:13.300 --> 05:21.080
brother Ferguson Beans, crouched over a hatch in the ground, wearing a cowboy hat and spurs,

05:21.360 --> 05:24.960
and the watch your father, William, gave him.

05:24.960 --> 05:28.480
You look down on your wrist, and the watch is there.

05:28.480 --> 05:35.400
You look up, and the pond is filled with water and animals, and Tildy B. Mitchell comes walking

05:35.400 --> 05:41.320
up out of the water toward you, and darkness fills your vision once more.

05:51.080 --> 06:02.160
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna is out cold, and it is your turn to act.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.160
Nice.

06:03.160 --> 06:10.160
I'm going to move over there by Kathy, and I'm going to take a shot at that one nearest.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.080
Go ahead and roll firearms for me.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.440
This is just one of the regular old fish men.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.960
Just a regular fish man.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.080
I rolled 24 again.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
Wow.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.360
On different dice also.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.360
That's weird.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.360
So strange.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
This room absolutely loves you.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.360
Go ahead and roll damage for me.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.360
1d10.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.840
Oh, there we go.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
That's a nine.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Nine.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
All right.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
Hell yeah.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.900
And that one actually goes down as well.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.280
You are dropping these things.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
Fuck yeah.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.280
Like flies.

06:41.280 --> 06:47.100
Hook, line, and sinker.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.860
And as it dies, it says, barely knew her.

06:49.860 --> 06:53.860
Oh, that one was so chill.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.820
Super chill fish man.

06:58.820 --> 06:59.820
John Lee Pettymore.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.820
It's your turn.

07:00.820 --> 07:04.660
I don't know what stat this would be, and I'm hoping you would agree with the American

07:04.660 --> 07:10.420
government during World War II that every American boy can throw a baseball.

07:10.420 --> 07:16.460
I want to roll a flashbang just right on top of Keith Vigna basically, like in the middle

07:16.460 --> 07:20.260
of the monster and the other guy who's right on top of him.

07:20.260 --> 07:23.060
And there was another guy that killed him because he's a bad ass.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.060
So yeah, I want to do that.

07:24.060 --> 07:25.060
Okay.

07:25.060 --> 07:27.220
That is going to be an athletics roll.

07:27.220 --> 07:29.700
Who do I have that?

07:29.700 --> 07:30.700
Kind of 50.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.700
50%.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.500
That's a pretty good chance.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.500
Yes.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.500
41.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
Yeah.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Describe what happens there.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.920
So yeah, I just kind of like from my position on the catwalk, pull the pin on the splash

07:40.920 --> 07:47.880
bang and I just chuck it underhanded and it sails in an arc and just lands right on

07:47.880 --> 07:50.280
Keith Vigna's chest.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.860
He's unconscious and it explodes.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.360
Would that burn his skin?

07:55.360 --> 07:56.440
A little, maybe.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.920
Not like two hit points worth or anything.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
You know what?

08:00.920 --> 08:06.320
It might go down to the armor, the metal beneath his skin veneer, but it's not going to do

08:06.320 --> 08:07.320
any real damage.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.360
He's going to look so cool after this.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
Yeah.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
Oh yeah, he will.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.800
Oh my gosh.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.800
You're welcome.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.600
The scars on his shoulder and back and then it's like, kind of like a cartoonish like

08:17.600 --> 08:18.600
soot.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
Yes.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.600
Explosions.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
Explosions.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.600
No eyebrows.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.440
Blown his shirt off.

08:26.440 --> 08:32.960
And yeah, and so this like a ball of light and sound just like emerges in the face of

08:32.960 --> 08:39.040
this giant fish monster and the other fish monster.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.720
And hopefully disorients him for a turn or so.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.640
They both immediately dive into the water.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.640
That could be good or bad.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.640
nearby.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.520
Doug, go see if they're around.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.960
So sorry, before they do that, Kathy Piston is up next and she moves past Clark on the

08:55.960 --> 08:56.960
other side.

08:56.960 --> 09:02.880
Oh, actually I'm in my mind, you kind of bend over and she does a roll over your back.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
Yeah, she does.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.200
Rush hour two style.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.200
Super cool.

09:06.200 --> 09:11.320
And on one knee gets in position and nobody understand the words that are coming out of

09:11.320 --> 09:14.320
your mouth, Kathy Piston.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.920
And she fucking rolls a success again.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.680
She's a goddamn assassin.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.800
Kathy Piston has not rolled over 40.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.520
Fucking John Wick.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.960
And she rolled a nine.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
Yeah, Kathy.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.160
That a girl.

09:26.160 --> 09:36.000
So she fires into the smaller of the two fishmen, the humanoid one, and it takes an absurd amount

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
of damage.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.280
You can see blood and acres just like leaking out of this thing.

09:41.280 --> 09:46.240
It is now its turn as well as its fish friend in the very back of the room that you can

09:46.240 --> 09:50.380
see on the other side of this giant beast thing.

09:50.380 --> 09:55.380
And they both dive into the water nearest them.

09:55.380 --> 10:05.080
It is the giant creatures turn and it looks down where it had just had its meal ready

10:05.160 --> 10:11.560
and you could tell it smelled and it knew this, this would be a meal that I've already

10:11.560 --> 10:19.400
had and it was taken away from me from the inside and I must feast once more.

10:19.400 --> 10:24.080
But the flashbang confused it and it swipes down into the water near it thinking that

10:24.080 --> 10:28.320
it's where the catwalk is and it falls face first directly into the water.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.320
What an idiot.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.680
It's a stupid thing.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.320
Fucking fish dick.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.120
I love fish dicks.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.120
I love fish dicks.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.760
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.720
And this is the, uh, who, who pressed the button?

10:45.720 --> 10:46.720
Was that John?

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
John Lee Pennymore?

10:47.720 --> 10:48.720
All right.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.920
So when it's your turn, it'll have been one round.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.920
Is that right?

10:50.920 --> 10:54.680
I did that at the end of my first turn and I had the turn where I threw a flash grenade.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.040
So that would have been one round.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.040
Absolutely.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
So it'll be two rounds.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.040
Coming up on two full rounds.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.640
Clark Bishop, it is your turn.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.120
The elevator door is not moving.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.240
What's the numbers above it say?

11:04.280 --> 11:07.280
Oh, that's an interesting question.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.280
666.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.280
Why?

11:09.280 --> 11:14.840
Uh, I'm going to, is that, is my distance to Keith two movements or one?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.840
Looks like two to me.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.840
I will.

11:18.840 --> 11:19.840
I got to take it.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
So I'm going to do it.

11:20.840 --> 11:25.520
That's real scary, but I'm going to have to just be there with the plan of picking them

11:25.520 --> 11:28.080
up next round.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.000
You're right there.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
John Lee Pennymore.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.040
It's been two rounds since you pressed the elevator button.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.480
What do you want to do this round?

11:35.480 --> 11:38.480
I want to run out as far as I can towards Clark.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
All right.

11:39.480 --> 11:47.040
You run to the end of the catwalk at the point where the room begins and it is now, it would

11:47.040 --> 11:48.280
be Luke's terms.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.120
Oh, rip.

11:50.120 --> 11:55.840
It is now the Fishman is the turn of the Fishman gotcha.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.560
And the Fishman turn of the Fishman, the turn of the Fishman.

12:00.120 --> 12:04.840
One of them, the one you would assume maybe that was in the back of the room pops up quite

12:04.840 --> 12:07.120
nearby.

12:07.120 --> 12:13.720
And the one that was nearer Keith and it's giant compatriot busts up out of the water

12:13.720 --> 12:21.160
and then it's going to roll a crit success.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.400
So it jumped real good.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.640
I mean, who cares?

12:23.640 --> 12:28.640
So the other side of Doug is at the elevator door at the elevator door time to waste that

12:28.640 --> 12:32.480
on the other side in between Doug Jacobs and the elevator door.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.200
And it critically succeeded.

12:34.200 --> 12:41.960
Basically what it did is it hopped up out and it is swinging its scythe at Doug Jacobs

12:41.960 --> 12:42.960
in the air.

12:42.960 --> 12:43.960
Doug Jacobs.

12:43.960 --> 12:44.960
Oh, wow.

12:44.960 --> 12:56.360
Doug Jacobs was not full of health as one might say.

12:56.360 --> 13:04.880
And with this critical success, while the fish person is in the air, it swings its scythe

13:04.880 --> 13:11.400
all the way through the neck of Doug Jacobs and the body of agent Trent Chad and lands

13:11.400 --> 13:18.520
standing in between you all and the elevator as the body and head fall separately into

13:18.520 --> 13:25.680
the two opposite sides of water on either side of the catwalk.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.680
He was a good boy.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.680
Poor agent Doug Chad.

13:27.680 --> 13:51.680
So at that exact moment that the song hits its climax, claws grab onto the catwalk just

13:51.680 --> 13:57.280
on either side, just next to Clark Bishop and Keith Vigna.

13:57.280 --> 14:04.720
And it starts pulling and pulling and trying to rip this catwalk down into the water.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.720
Oh no.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.720
He rolls an op too.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.720
Of course he does.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.720
It slows.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.720
It's not very much.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.720
Yeah, it fits contested in any way.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.720
Oh yeah.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.520
Clark gets pulling up against it.

14:19.520 --> 14:31.560
He's like re-riveting it as it comes like popping out.

14:31.560 --> 14:37.860
Clark Bishop needs to make an extremely important strength roll in order to, I assume, hold

14:37.860 --> 14:41.880
on to Keith Vigna and keep the two of you on dry catwalk.

14:41.880 --> 14:50.040
I'm going to have you roll that now against this ought to.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
Oh yeah.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
Hell yeah.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.320
It's a 54 on a 65.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
Congratulations.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.240
Clark, I love that roll.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.160
Do you say anything to his unconscious body?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
To Keith's unconscious body?

15:01.160 --> 15:02.280
Yeah, as you're pulling him.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.680
I got you my child.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.680
My baby boy.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.920
Go ahead and roll sanity.

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
Fuck you too.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.920
That's a fail.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.920
That's a fail over my power.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.920
Oh, all right.

15:16.920 --> 15:21.920
Well go ahead and play that up and remember that you're God and lose one's sanity.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.920
I forgot about that.

15:24.920 --> 15:29.920
Luke's dead ass could make himself useful and bring us some beers.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.920
It's going to depend on how you want to do this mechanically, but what Clark would do

15:35.920 --> 15:41.920
now is he would throw Keith down onto the catwalk, turn around, and he wants to walk

15:41.920 --> 15:48.520
up to the giant fish thing and throw a grenade down its gullet, the frag grenade.

15:48.520 --> 15:52.800
Okay, so you would have to put yourself into the water to do that.

15:52.800 --> 15:58.420
This thing is pulled down successfully and it is in the water now with the catwalk as

15:58.420 --> 16:00.320
you are up on the catwalk.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.720
He's about five feet below you.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.720
I can't.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.720
He can't just toss it down.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.720
Oh, you want to toss a grenade?

16:05.020 --> 16:10.020
I thought you wanted to place it gently inside of its mouth.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.020
Do you assume we're idiots?

16:12.020 --> 16:13.020
Yeah, baseline.

16:13.020 --> 16:15.020
No, of course not.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.020
Come on.

16:16.020 --> 16:17.020
I'm sorry.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.020
I didn't mean it, baby.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.020
Only many times.

16:21.020 --> 16:25.020
Joe, go ahead and roll an athletics check here.

16:25.020 --> 16:27.020
We're going willy-nilly here.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.020
Is there any kind of advantage for being right over it?

16:30.020 --> 16:31.020
Yeah.

16:31.320 --> 16:35.320
So you actually get, because you'll be rolling athletics, to drop it in.

16:35.320 --> 16:41.320
Maybe a nice beer pong shot this grenade into the mouth of this being.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.320
Because it's right there next to you, I'll give you a plus 20% on your athletics.

16:45.320 --> 16:49.320
That's really handy because I don't have any, so I got the baseline 30.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.320
Alright.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
And then you add 20.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.320
I got a 50 on this.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
50% chance here.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.320
Here we go.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.320
I pass a 37 on a 50.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.320
Alright.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.620
Roll 4d6.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.620
Ooh, baby.

17:02.620 --> 17:03.620
Baby, baby.

17:03.620 --> 17:06.620
You got a couple of d6s over there?

17:06.620 --> 17:07.620
Yes, sir.

17:07.620 --> 17:08.620
Actually, I got some here.

17:08.620 --> 17:09.620
Never mind.

17:13.620 --> 17:17.620
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

17:17.620 --> 17:21.620
11 points of damage with that grenade down inside of its belly.

17:21.620 --> 17:28.620
The grenade explodes and you hear the same screeching roar that you heard when the flashbang

17:28.620 --> 17:29.620
went off.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.920
It's like...

17:34.920 --> 17:36.920
Sorry, I was yawning into the mic just then.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.920
What was the sound it made?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.920
It was actually really similar to what you just did.

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
Could you just...

17:45.920 --> 17:47.920
I'm so sorry, I didn't get much sleep last night.

17:47.920 --> 17:48.920
We can take a break if you need a Red Bull or something.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.920
Yeah, I'm gonna run down to the gas station.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.920
And it is John Lee Pettymore's turn.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.920
I want to move one space forward and do the same thing.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.920
Drop a grenade right on top of it.

17:59.720 --> 18:05.220
Roll athletics for me with a plus 20%, putting your athletics at 70% if I'm not mistaken.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.220
You are not mistaken.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.220
Oh, 70!

18:10.220 --> 18:13.220
70 on a 70.

18:13.220 --> 18:15.220
Roll 4d6 for damage for me.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.220
10.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.220
10 total?

18:19.220 --> 18:20.220
Yeah.

18:20.220 --> 18:21.220
Or did you roll 10 on 1d6?

18:21.220 --> 18:28.220
This thing makes the same horrifying noise, but even louder this time.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.520
And it starts to kind of gargle.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.520
It's like...

18:35.520 --> 18:37.520
As it moves into the water.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.520
Down below.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.520
And it is Kathy Piston's turn.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.520
That was the end of my turn.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.520
Any change in the elevator?

18:45.520 --> 18:47.520
Oh, go ahead and roll alertness for me.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.520
7.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.520
No.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.520
Damn.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.520
You know my alertness is 60 and not 6, right?

18:58.520 --> 19:00.520
Yes and no.

19:03.520 --> 19:08.520
Kathy Piston moves up at the end of the catwalk leading to the elevator door

19:08.520 --> 19:15.520
and lines up her shot on the fish man that just took down, decapitated,

19:15.520 --> 19:19.520
and smiled at the death of Doug Jacobs.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.520
And she rolls another success.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.520
Yes!

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
Yes, my murder queen.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.520
This girl!

19:24.520 --> 19:26.520
Joe, these dice you got me are great.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.520
Hell yeah!

19:27.820 --> 19:30.820
But she only rolls a 4 on damage.

19:30.820 --> 19:36.820
And it doesn't look like it took very much damage at all as she shoots it

19:36.820 --> 19:40.820
in its kind of plate amphibious lining there.

19:40.820 --> 19:45.820
And some of the sharper parts catch some of the bullets and make it so

19:45.820 --> 19:51.820
I don't know why I'm explaining armor on a fish creature to you, but

19:51.820 --> 19:52.820
that's what's going on there.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.820
The fish man will retaliate.

19:56.120 --> 20:03.120
And the fish man that is closest to Kathy Piston rolls a 10 and succeeds

20:03.120 --> 20:09.120
and hits her for 7 damage with the scythe and just digs the scythe

20:09.120 --> 20:15.120
into her leg and she starts screaming out and she's gonna try to like

20:15.120 --> 20:19.120
grab on to the end of the scythe and kind of battle back and forth

20:19.120 --> 20:23.120
but as she's battling it's just digging in further and further and

20:23.420 --> 20:28.420
it finally hits a nerve in her leg and she just can't take it anymore

20:28.420 --> 20:30.420
and falls backwards.

20:30.420 --> 20:33.420
Kathy Piston is now bleeding into the water as well.

20:33.420 --> 20:34.420
Isn't that good?

20:34.420 --> 20:39.420
There's also a fish man that is right next to Clark Bishop and Keith

20:39.420 --> 20:44.420
Vigna and he is going to try to pin Clark Bishop to the ground

20:44.420 --> 20:48.420
so we are going to roll an opposed test of unarmed combat.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.420
Okay.

20:49.720 --> 20:54.720
I rolled a 30 succeeding.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.720
I rolled a 15 succeeding but lower.

20:58.720 --> 21:04.720
So this fish man uses its scythe to pin you to the ground and it

21:04.720 --> 21:11.720
puts the long end of the stick up against your throat and it's knee

21:11.720 --> 21:17.720
down on the thing and as it's bearing down on you its teeth are gritted

21:18.020 --> 21:25.020
and you see this mucusy wet slime form and it's big thick lips and

21:25.020 --> 21:30.020
it kind of drips down directly onto your face and just splats.

21:40.020 --> 21:46.020
The giant creature jumps out of the water and you can see that it

21:46.320 --> 21:51.320
has not taken enough damage to be considered what one might call

21:51.320 --> 21:57.320
bloody in a game called D&D and it's coming for you John Lee

21:57.320 --> 21:58.320
Pettymore.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.320
It's coming for you real fucking hard with one of its claws.

22:01.320 --> 22:05.320
It reaches back all the way to get as much momentum as possible and

22:05.320 --> 22:09.320
it claws at you and it misses.

22:09.620 --> 22:17.620
Kevin Lee Pettymore ducks agilely and doesn't hit its

22:17.620 --> 22:23.620
microphone and he flips two birds at the fish.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.620
Oh very very very cool.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.620
Very cool indeed Clark Bishop.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.620
It is your turn.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.620
You are pinned currently.

22:30.620 --> 22:35.620
The only thing you can do unless you're more creative than I is an

22:35.620 --> 22:38.620
unarmed contest to become unpinned.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.920
Or unarmed combat.

22:39.920 --> 22:40.920
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
Get creative.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
Try to persuade it.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
Those are the two options.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
Yeah, I kiss it on the lips.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.920
I do things your wife would never do to you.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.920
Yeah, I'm going to use the unarmed combat to try and break free.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
It rolls a 16 succeeding.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.220
I failed.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.220
74 on a 70.

23:11.220 --> 23:15.220
It's actually going to take a shot at you here.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.220
Can it do that?

23:16.220 --> 23:17.220
It's my turn.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.220
Oh, it is your turn.

23:18.220 --> 23:20.220
I'll wait until it's its turn.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.220
It keeps you pinned though.

23:21.220 --> 23:22.220
That's for damn sure.

23:22.220 --> 23:24.220
Thomas, it's John Lee Pettymore's turn.

23:24.220 --> 23:27.220
Guys, if I don't move do I get two attacks?

23:27.220 --> 23:28.220
No.

23:28.220 --> 23:30.220
Okay, but you can move and attack?

23:30.220 --> 23:31.220
Yeah.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.220
Let me pitch you this.

23:32.220 --> 23:37.220
I want to move one step backwards while tossing a grenade forward

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
and then shoot a shotgun.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.520
I just got mad deja vu.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.520
Have you done that move before?

23:41.520 --> 23:42.520
No.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.520
I sure like it.

23:45.520 --> 23:48.520
So I toss my last frag grenade at it while I'm right in front of it

23:48.520 --> 23:49.520
and stepping backwards.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.520
Okay, I'll give you a plus 20%.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.520
Okay.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.520
Oh, wait.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.520
Oh, wait.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.520
Yes.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
Okay, 61 on a 70 modified.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.520
Nice.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
Nice.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.520
It's going to be another 46 of damage.

24:02.820 --> 24:07.820
Listeners, we're not saying 46 like the number.

24:07.820 --> 24:10.820
Four six-sided die.

24:10.820 --> 24:11.820
Indeed.

24:11.820 --> 24:15.820
Four D six.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.820
Four dicks six.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.820
Which is the alternative name of our podcast,

24:19.820 --> 24:21.820
but the size is...

24:21.820 --> 24:23.820
We found out the math didn't quite work out.

24:23.820 --> 24:25.820
Joe throws things on.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.820
The weight.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.120
Dropped one of my D six and crushed my balls

24:30.120 --> 24:32.120
trying to catch it with my legs.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.120
The dangers of real playing.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.120
So I'm actually going to count that one

24:36.120 --> 24:38.120
that's a four right now on the floor.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.120
Fucking good because I sacrificed for it.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
You know what?

24:41.120 --> 24:43.120
We've never made rules about squishing your balls

24:43.120 --> 24:45.120
while you roll, so let's keep that four.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.120
Okay, so four, four, two, and three,

24:47.120 --> 24:48.120
which is...

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
Thirteen.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.120
Thirteen.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.120
Thirteen.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.120
Thirteen.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120
Thirteen.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.120
Thirteen.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.120
Thirteen.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.120
Thirteen.

24:56.420 --> 24:57.420
Which is...

24:57.420 --> 24:58.420
Thirteen.

24:58.420 --> 24:59.420
Thirteen.

24:59.420 --> 25:00.420
Wow.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.420
You do thirteen damage

25:02.420 --> 25:05.420
and you actually hear a whimper

25:05.420 --> 25:07.420
from this giant creature in front of you.

25:07.420 --> 25:09.420
It swallowed a kid!

25:11.420 --> 25:13.420
It's like...

25:15.420 --> 25:18.420
I don't know if you quite agreed to my pitch

25:18.420 --> 25:20.420
but I do want to shoot my shotgun as I...

25:20.420 --> 25:22.420
Oh, I did not agree to that.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.420
You didn't disagree.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.420
I'll let you do what you did. How about that?

25:28.420 --> 25:30.420
Well, you would take it away from me if I pressed the point.

25:33.420 --> 25:35.420
John Lee Pennymore's dead.

25:37.420 --> 25:39.420
John Lee Pennymore, go home, John Lee.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.420
John Lee Pennymore falls over heart attack.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.420
Dead. Get out of here.

25:43.420 --> 25:45.420
You said you trusted me. Trust me now.

25:48.420 --> 25:49.420
Good lord.

25:49.420 --> 25:52.420
No, I think moving and throwing a grenade seems...

25:52.420 --> 25:54.420
seems perfectly reasonable for a turn.

25:54.720 --> 25:59.720
And it is going to be Kathy Piston's turn

25:59.720 --> 26:04.720
and she just got mucked up in the leg by a scythe.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.720
You can say fuck.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.720
We've all been doing it.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.720
For sure.

26:09.720 --> 26:10.720
For real?

26:10.720 --> 26:11.720
Yeah.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.720
You can even say crap.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.720
No, with my mouth?

26:13.720 --> 26:14.720
Yeah.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.720
Alright.

26:15.720 --> 26:16.720
But you can't say beep.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.720
Kathy Piston just got...

26:20.720 --> 26:21.720
I can't do it.

26:21.720 --> 26:22.720
Mucked in the leg by a scythe

26:22.720 --> 26:23.720
and she's bleeding all over the place

26:24.020 --> 26:27.020
and she looks up with this determination in her eyes

26:27.020 --> 26:29.020
and a barrel in her hand.

26:29.020 --> 26:32.020
But the gun part, not just the barrel.

26:32.020 --> 26:34.020
Yeah, I was like, where'd she get that barrel?

26:34.020 --> 26:36.020
I don't know. I don't know. She's good with it.

26:36.020 --> 26:40.020
And she is going to once again

26:40.020 --> 26:43.020
fire at a fish man

26:43.020 --> 26:47.020
succeeding once again on her roll.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.020
MVP.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.020
She cannot stop. She will not stop.

26:50.020 --> 26:52.020
However, she just once again

26:52.320 --> 26:53.320
does not roll enough damage

26:53.320 --> 26:55.320
to actually damage the creature

26:55.320 --> 26:57.320
and therefore, she's like

26:57.320 --> 26:59.320
my leg, your leg

26:59.320 --> 27:01.320
and she shoots it in the foot

27:01.320 --> 27:03.320
and it starts bleeding out

27:03.320 --> 27:06.320
and hopping up and down on one foot

27:06.320 --> 27:08.320
while still chanting

27:08.320 --> 27:10.320
photography, photography

27:10.320 --> 27:12.320
photography, photography

27:12.320 --> 27:14.320
Very cool. Very cool fish.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.320
Very cool fish person.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.320
However, it's now that fish person's turn.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.320
And it doesn't like being shot in the foot.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.320
And so, it's going to come

27:26.320 --> 27:28.320
for Kathy Piston.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.320
This fish creature takes its scythe out

27:33.320 --> 27:35.320
raises it above its head

27:35.320 --> 27:37.320
and slams down the scythe

27:37.320 --> 27:39.320
into the top of Kathy Piston's skull.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.320
No!

27:42.320 --> 27:44.320
I need you both to roll sanity

27:44.320 --> 27:46.320
for witnessing this horrible event.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
For some reason that one hurts the most.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.320
75

27:50.620 --> 27:52.620
A fail above my power.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.620
I fail 24 on a 17.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.620
Alright. I need you both

27:57.620 --> 27:59.620
to lose just one sanity.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.620
Kathy Piston was a human

28:01.620 --> 28:03.620
trafficking asshole.

28:03.620 --> 28:05.620
And just because her death was gruesome

28:05.620 --> 28:07.620
does not mean

28:07.620 --> 28:09.620
that it may not have been deserved.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.620
I don't know if deserved was the right word there

28:11.620 --> 28:13.620
but she dead now.

28:13.620 --> 28:15.620
Her tank is down.

28:17.620 --> 28:19.620
Or no, she was DPS.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
She's the glass cannon.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
You hear chants from underwater.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.920
MVP! MVP!

28:26.920 --> 28:28.920
It's pretty unsettling but also pretty cool.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.920
I wonder how Luke's doing.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.920
The other fishman

28:34.920 --> 28:36.920
is standing on top

28:36.920 --> 28:38.920
of Clark Bishop's throat

28:38.920 --> 28:40.920
with its scythe pressed down

28:40.920 --> 28:42.920
and according to the rules of Delta Green

28:42.920 --> 28:44.920
it gets a free shot.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.920
It contested me.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.920
I can't contest it.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.220
Dad!

28:51.220 --> 28:53.220
Dad!

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
With an automatic success.

28:56.220 --> 28:58.220
Now we're worried

28:58.220 --> 29:00.220
about the rules of Delta Green

29:00.220 --> 29:02.220
and all of a sudden

29:02.220 --> 29:04.220
all of a sudden

29:04.220 --> 29:06.220
Zach's an expert.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.220
I read the rules today finally.

29:08.220 --> 29:10.220
You read a Chuckling Boy post?

29:12.220 --> 29:14.220
Quick shout out to user ChucklingBoy

29:14.220 --> 29:16.220
on Reddit who is doing

29:16.220 --> 29:18.220
incredible work on the subreddit

29:18.520 --> 29:20.520
for r slash pretending to be people

29:20.520 --> 29:22.520
and it is so cool.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.520
He posts these posts

29:24.520 --> 29:26.520
on Monday and Thursday called

29:26.520 --> 29:28.520
Mythos Monday and Technique Thursday

29:28.520 --> 29:30.520
and they are

29:30.520 --> 29:32.520
just phenomenal.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.520
Awesome reference guide for running

29:34.520 --> 29:36.520
a Delta Green game.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.520
They are so good you should go and check them out.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.520
It's absurd.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.520
He has been such a huge supporter

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
of us and we really

29:44.520 --> 29:46.520
can't thank him enough for all he's doing.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.820
Thanks man.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.820
It's really fun to read all those posts.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.820
I don't read all of your posts because I'm worried

29:52.820 --> 29:54.820
that I'll learn too much and I like

29:54.820 --> 29:56.820
being the one who doesn't know a lot about the game.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.820
Also he can't read.

29:58.820 --> 30:00.820
I just skim him for the stuff

30:00.820 --> 30:02.820
that looks neat.

30:02.820 --> 30:04.820
That's a pretty letter.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.820
Clark this thing

30:06.820 --> 30:08.820
just headbutts you for one

30:08.820 --> 30:10.820
damage.

30:10.820 --> 30:12.820
Breaking your nose just a little bit.

30:13.620 --> 30:15.620
You feel an

30:15.620 --> 30:17.620
intense rush of pain

30:17.620 --> 30:19.620
throughout but it doesn't

30:19.620 --> 30:21.620
kill you that's for sure.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.620
That puts me at 15.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.620
It is the massive

30:25.620 --> 30:27.620
creature's turn and it is going

30:27.620 --> 30:29.620
to rush

30:29.620 --> 30:31.620
John Lee Pettymore who just threw

30:31.620 --> 30:33.620
another grenade directly

30:33.620 --> 30:35.620
at its face

30:35.620 --> 30:37.620
and it rolls a success

30:37.620 --> 30:39.620
with the claw.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.620
The claw.

30:41.620 --> 30:43.620
Oh actually what did you do with your turn?

30:43.620 --> 30:45.620
Tossed a grenade at it and took a step backwards.

30:45.620 --> 30:47.620
And he pulled out his shield.

30:50.620 --> 30:52.620
That is going to be 7 damage

30:52.620 --> 30:54.620
and it has a chance

30:54.620 --> 30:56.620
to grab you.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.620
It failed the grab attempt.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.620
But its claw just like

31:05.620 --> 31:07.620
swipes at you scratching the

31:07.620 --> 31:09.620
shit out of your body

31:09.620 --> 31:11.620
in the front part of it

31:11.620 --> 31:13.620
ripping your cool clothes that Kevin had

31:13.620 --> 31:15.620
all the black tactical gear

31:15.620 --> 31:17.620
less tactical now

31:17.620 --> 31:19.620
that it's been shredded up by a

31:19.620 --> 31:21.620
big fucking claw.

31:21.620 --> 31:23.620
It takes me down to 6 hit points.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.620
Oh my god.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.620
We are fucked.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.620
With that I have to teach you.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.620
How's that elevator?

31:31.620 --> 31:33.620
Roll alertness for me.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.620
It's not that turn yet. Never mind.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.620
Oh we didn't do it though.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.620
It's my last turn.

31:39.620 --> 31:41.620
So Clark at the top of this round go ahead and roll

31:41.620 --> 31:43.620
an alertness check for me.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.620
I fail.

31:47.620 --> 31:49.620
An 82 on a 70.

31:49.620 --> 31:51.620
That would make sense. I'm on the ground being

31:51.620 --> 31:53.620
strangled by a fish man.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.620
I wouldn't know what's going on with the elevator.

31:55.620 --> 31:57.620
Yeah.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.620
I first saw a thing where you just

31:59.620 --> 32:01.620
lifted up enough.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.620
Just to have something happen

32:03.620 --> 32:05.620
maybe.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.620
And it's your turn. What would you like to do?

32:07.620 --> 32:09.620
You are still being pinned currently.

32:09.620 --> 32:11.620
Would you allow

32:11.620 --> 32:13.620
can I reach

32:13.620 --> 32:15.620
into my boot to grab my other gun

32:15.620 --> 32:17.620
and use it to fire up at the

32:17.620 --> 32:19.620
creature? No.

32:19.620 --> 32:21.620
Then I'm just going to unarmed back at him.

32:21.620 --> 32:23.620
So that's the thing with being pinned.

32:23.620 --> 32:25.620
It's supposed to completely

32:25.620 --> 32:27.620
immobilize you.

32:27.620 --> 32:29.620
So he just has to bust out of it with strength.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
Exactly.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.620
Which I should be able to do and I'm having trouble.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.620
He'll get it.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.620
I succeeded with a 12.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.620
I succeeded with a 29.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.620
Fuck yeah.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.620
He punched this fish bitch in the face.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.620
Fish fish.

32:45.620 --> 32:47.620
I don't know how the unpinning rules

32:47.620 --> 32:49.620
work but can I fling him so hard

32:49.620 --> 32:51.620
that he gets away from me?

32:51.620 --> 32:53.620
He'll be enough away from you to where you can

32:53.620 --> 32:55.620
act naturally or however

32:55.620 --> 32:57.620
you want on your next turn but so will he.

32:57.620 --> 32:59.620
And or it or

32:59.620 --> 33:01.620
whatever a fish person

33:01.620 --> 33:03.620
that's you know. Does it do any damage

33:03.620 --> 33:05.620
to him? It just unpicks me. No.

33:05.620 --> 33:07.620
It just gets him off.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.620
Crickets. Yeah it does.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.620
Thomas. It's John Lee Pettymore's turn.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.620
Okay. Low on health.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.620
Yeah. Low on grenades.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.620
High in spirit.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.620
I'm going to walk up to the big fish creature and

33:21.620 --> 33:23.620
blast my shotgun at it.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.620
Cool. Point blank.

33:25.620 --> 33:27.620
Very cool.

33:27.620 --> 33:29.620
Did I get any

33:29.620 --> 33:31.620
modifiers for point blank?

33:31.620 --> 33:33.620
Right at the fish eye.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.620
It definitely seems like you should with a shotgun

33:35.620 --> 33:37.620
at close range. Well there's a damage

33:37.620 --> 33:39.620
modifier. Oh gotcha.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.620
Yeah. I'll give you a plus 20.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.620
It's going to be hard to miss. Doesn't matter

33:43.620 --> 33:45.620
because I rolled a 53 on a 60.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.620
Nice. So yeah. Point blank

33:47.620 --> 33:49.620
range. That is

33:49.620 --> 33:51.620
3d6. It is indeed.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.620
It would be 4 if it was a crit.

33:53.620 --> 33:55.620
5, 3, and 2.

33:55.620 --> 33:57.620
So 10 again. 10 again.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.620
Just like give us a visual of what's

33:59.620 --> 34:01.620
going on here. Well John Lee Pettymore

34:01.620 --> 34:03.620
he looks like

34:03.620 --> 34:05.620
Nick Cage at the end of Mandy.

34:05.620 --> 34:07.620
He's just completely covered

34:07.620 --> 34:09.620
in blood. You can see

34:09.620 --> 34:11.620
this giant just like these

34:11.620 --> 34:13.620
gashes down his chest

34:13.620 --> 34:15.620
revealing bits of like bone and

34:15.620 --> 34:17.620
metal and he kind of staggers

34:17.620 --> 34:19.620
towards this thing one space

34:19.620 --> 34:21.620
and then just brings his shotgun

34:21.620 --> 34:23.620
up to his hip and just blast

34:23.620 --> 34:25.620
it right into its fish face.

34:25.620 --> 34:27.620
And doing so blows

34:27.620 --> 34:29.620
a massive chunk

34:29.620 --> 34:31.620
of the fish's teeth

34:31.620 --> 34:33.620
these massive human

34:33.620 --> 34:35.620
like teeth. This is like a mouth

34:35.620 --> 34:37.620
that you could climb up into for

34:37.620 --> 34:39.620
fun and it

34:39.620 --> 34:41.620
like a quarter of this

34:41.620 --> 34:43.620
fish's mouth just

34:43.620 --> 34:45.620
dissipates into like blood

34:45.620 --> 34:47.620
and dust and slime

34:47.620 --> 34:49.620
as the creature

34:49.620 --> 34:51.620
just moans and

34:51.620 --> 34:53.620
spins away

34:53.620 --> 34:55.620
from you as it takes this

34:55.620 --> 34:57.620
massive amount of damage.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.620
But it is still conscious and it is

34:59.620 --> 35:01.620
still moving. I don't know if

35:01.620 --> 35:03.620
I'll get a chance so I'd like to say something cool now

35:03.620 --> 35:05.620
having heard it so much. So

35:05.620 --> 35:07.620
John Lee Kevin Moore

35:07.620 --> 35:09.620
he

35:09.620 --> 35:11.620
kind of groans

35:11.620 --> 35:13.620
looks like tonight McDonald's is serving

35:13.620 --> 35:15.620
filet of you.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.620
No but for real.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.620
And it's so

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
offended and taken aback it dies.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.620
MVP.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.620
So good Kathy.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.620
John one of the

35:31.620 --> 35:33.620
other fishmen is the one that

35:33.620 --> 35:35.620
just murdered the shit out of

35:35.620 --> 35:37.620
Kathy Piston and really

35:37.620 --> 35:39.620
fucked her up good comes up

35:39.620 --> 35:41.620
behind you and is going

35:41.620 --> 35:43.620
to swing at you

35:43.620 --> 35:45.620
with its scythe.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.620
He rolled a 43

35:47.620 --> 35:49.620
on

35:49.620 --> 35:51.620
a 25 percent.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.620
Nice.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.620
And it swings right

35:55.620 --> 35:57.620
above your head and you feel

35:57.620 --> 35:59.620
the wind brush atop.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.620
You see little wisps of hair

36:01.620 --> 36:03.620
get shaved right off.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.620
Exactly. And the camera

36:05.620 --> 36:07.620
immediately whip pans over to

36:07.620 --> 36:09.620
one fish man standing

36:09.620 --> 36:11.620
near Clark and Keith

36:11.620 --> 36:13.620
and it is going to attempt

36:13.620 --> 36:15.620
the same thing at

36:15.620 --> 36:17.620
Clark Bishop and fucking fails.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.620
Oh thank God. Missing wildly

36:19.620 --> 36:21.620
after being thrown off

36:21.620 --> 36:23.620
of Clark Bishop it doesn't know

36:23.620 --> 36:25.620
quite what to do.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.620
However

36:27.620 --> 36:29.620
what does know what to do

36:29.620 --> 36:31.620
is this giant giant beast

36:31.620 --> 36:33.620
that is just

36:33.620 --> 36:35.620
reeling from the attack

36:35.620 --> 36:37.620
sent to it by John Lee

36:37.620 --> 36:39.620
Kevin Moore. I need you to

36:39.620 --> 36:41.620
roll an unarmed combat

36:41.620 --> 36:43.620
contest.

36:43.620 --> 36:45.620
18 on a 40.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.620
19.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.620
Oh my God.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.620
Fuck.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.620
With

36:53.620 --> 36:55.620
claws akimbo on either side

36:55.620 --> 36:57.620
of you it grabs on

36:57.620 --> 36:59.620
to the catwalk

36:59.620 --> 37:01.620
below it and it uses

37:01.620 --> 37:03.620
its giant arms to

37:03.620 --> 37:05.620
launch itself toward

37:05.620 --> 37:07.620
John Lee Pettymore with its mouth

37:07.620 --> 37:09.620
wide open and it swallows

37:09.620 --> 37:11.620
you whole.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.620
Oh.

37:13.620 --> 37:15.620
Well

37:15.620 --> 37:17.620
Keith got out of this and he's an idiot so

37:17.620 --> 37:19.620
this is arguably

37:19.620 --> 37:21.620
the safest place I could be right now.

37:23.620 --> 37:25.620
With that

37:25.620 --> 37:27.620
you take six damage.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.620
Oh. Well that's uh

37:29.620 --> 37:31.620
that puts me at zero.

37:33.620 --> 37:35.620
That puts you at zero zero? Yeah

37:35.620 --> 37:37.620
I had six points.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.620
Oh shit. John Lee Pettymore

37:39.620 --> 37:41.620
the darkness closes in on you

37:41.620 --> 37:43.620
as the light above

37:43.620 --> 37:45.620
you leaves

37:45.620 --> 37:47.620
as this giant creatures mouth

37:47.620 --> 37:49.620
closes

37:49.620 --> 37:51.620
but you can still feel

37:51.620 --> 37:53.620
all of this wet

37:53.620 --> 37:55.620
gunk

37:55.620 --> 37:57.620
inside and you can feel

37:57.620 --> 37:59.620
water

37:59.620 --> 38:01.620
and just. I want to spend

38:01.620 --> 38:03.620
ten like to avoid major damage.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.620
You still

38:05.620 --> 38:07.620
feel this water

38:07.620 --> 38:09.620
rushing in.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.620
Okay we'll put that on pause.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.620
My super cool monologuing

38:13.620 --> 38:15.620
about the water that you feel

38:15.620 --> 38:17.620
as you fucking die. I was

38:17.620 --> 38:19.620
I was frantically scanning

38:19.620 --> 38:21.620
the little luck thing.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.620
The sheep of how to spend luck.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.620
Yeah for ten points I can

38:25.620 --> 38:27.620
spend uh. You know the last couple

38:27.620 --> 38:29.620
episodes could have used some luck spins maybe.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.620
I don't know. Anyway where are we at here?

38:31.620 --> 38:33.620
I'm at twenty luck.

38:33.620 --> 38:35.620
Oh shit. So I can spend ten points to

38:35.620 --> 38:37.620
roll a d6

38:37.620 --> 38:39.620
to reduce damage on that last attack.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.620
Incredible.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.620
Five. Fuck yeah. Holy shit.

38:43.620 --> 38:45.620
Very well done.

38:45.620 --> 38:47.620
So you're at five hit points and you feel

38:47.620 --> 38:49.620
this water touching your skin

38:49.620 --> 38:51.620
and all this fish guts

38:51.620 --> 38:53.620
and blood and

38:53.620 --> 38:55.620
viscera that is inside

38:55.620 --> 38:57.620
of this fish and I need you to

38:57.620 --> 38:59.620
roll an intelligence check for me.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.620
Ooh.

39:01.620 --> 39:03.620
He has a seventy five intelligence

39:03.620 --> 39:05.620
and he rolls a thirty one. You remember

39:05.620 --> 39:07.620
that the hole that Keith

39:07.620 --> 39:09.620
blew into this giant

39:09.620 --> 39:11.620
creature is on its

39:11.620 --> 39:13.620
right side.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.620
And you think by the way

39:15.620 --> 39:17.620
that you were eaten

39:17.620 --> 39:19.620
and then went down

39:19.620 --> 39:21.620
Jude!

39:21.620 --> 39:23.620
No!

39:23.620 --> 39:25.620
That's gonna be on your

39:25.620 --> 39:27.620
left side. That big hole

39:27.620 --> 39:29.620
there. I pressed forward

39:29.620 --> 39:31.620
into the fish.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.620
And we will

39:33.620 --> 39:35.620
make my way to that hole.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.620
It's a badass scene in my head if you had known

39:37.620 --> 39:39.620
that that's what was gonna happen

39:39.620 --> 39:41.620
that you just go charging at its open mouth

39:41.620 --> 39:43.620
and dive straight in.

39:43.620 --> 39:45.620
That's exactly what happened listeners.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.620
It was my plan all along.

39:47.620 --> 39:51.620
It is the fishman's

39:51.620 --> 39:53.620
turn. I feel like I haven't gone in a while.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.620
Is that maybe the case?

39:55.620 --> 39:57.620
You struggled with the uh...

39:57.620 --> 39:59.620
By the fishman I meant Clark Bishop. It's Clark

39:59.620 --> 40:01.620
Bishop's turn. Big Daddy just went

40:01.620 --> 40:03.620
and swallowed John. Also his name is

40:03.620 --> 40:05.620
Big Daddy. Big Dad!

40:05.620 --> 40:07.620
You don't play video

40:07.620 --> 40:09.620
games so. Oh I don't. What's that?

40:09.620 --> 40:11.620
Bioshock. Oh cool.

40:11.620 --> 40:13.620
You're in the aquatic realm though.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.620
We're close. Sure.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.620
He doesn't know it's a rip off.

40:17.620 --> 40:19.620
I'll take it.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.620
And so Clark Bishop

40:21.620 --> 40:23.620
it is your turn indeed.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.620
How does the action

40:25.620 --> 40:27.620
economy work with picking up Keith?

40:27.620 --> 40:29.620
Is it a whole action to do that?

40:29.620 --> 40:31.620
We'll say yes.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.620
But then you can still move with him.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.620
But only one spot? Only one spot.

40:35.620 --> 40:37.620
And the

40:37.620 --> 40:39.620
fishman that's nearest me how's he looking

40:39.620 --> 40:41.620
health wise? Have we touched him even?

40:41.620 --> 40:43.620
A little bit but he looks pretty fresh.

40:43.620 --> 40:45.620
Oh but you're free of him right? I'm free of him.

40:45.620 --> 40:47.620
I can move now. I just worry about how fast

40:47.620 --> 40:49.620
he can move. He can get all up

40:49.620 --> 40:51.620
on us real quick. I'm gonna have to

40:51.620 --> 40:53.620
I think look at the elevator.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.620
How's it looking?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.620
That's interesting because

40:57.620 --> 40:59.620
the elevator

40:59.620 --> 41:01.620
roll alertness.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.620
I do not pass

41:05.620 --> 41:07.620
a 72 on a 70.

41:07.620 --> 41:09.620
You do not see anything or hear anything.

41:09.620 --> 41:11.620
Alright I'm going to

41:11.620 --> 41:13.620
pick up Keith and fire

41:13.620 --> 41:15.620
the fishman. Alright. No movement.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.620
If you're gonna pick up Keith on this one

41:17.620 --> 41:19.620
I'm gonna give you a negative 20 on the firearms.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.620
Okay. Alright go ahead and roll

41:21.620 --> 41:23.620
firearms for me. So I

41:23.620 --> 41:25.620
normally have 80 I'll be rolling on a 60.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.620
Fuck! It's a 76

41:29.620 --> 41:31.620
I would have passed but I don't pass.

41:31.620 --> 41:33.620
You could roll you could spend 16

41:33.620 --> 41:35.620
luck. I'm not gonna. I think you mean

41:35.620 --> 41:37.620
luck.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.620
John Lee Pettymore.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.620
Holding his breath

41:41.620 --> 41:43.620
and swimming downward into the

41:43.620 --> 41:45.620
beast he John Lee Pettymore

41:45.620 --> 41:47.620
is going to

41:47.620 --> 41:49.620
release his remaining flash bang

41:49.620 --> 41:51.620
and one of the smoke grenades

41:51.620 --> 41:53.620
down into these guts as he like

41:53.620 --> 41:55.620
swims out the hole. I'm gonna need

41:55.620 --> 41:57.620
an athletics check in order

41:57.620 --> 41:59.620
to properly

41:59.620 --> 42:01.620
do this whole maneuver.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.620
41

42:03.620 --> 42:05.620
on a 50. Nice. Which I think is

42:05.620 --> 42:07.620
exactly what I rolled last time on my

42:07.620 --> 42:09.620
athletics check. You gave me

42:09.620 --> 42:11.620
haunted dice Jeff.

42:11.620 --> 42:13.620
We're bumping rolling doubles. It's weird.

42:13.620 --> 42:15.620
It's real creepy I don't like it at all. Yeah I rolled

42:15.620 --> 42:17.620
two eights in a row before the game even started

42:17.620 --> 42:19.620
because I was rolling like a dumb ass.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.620
Those would have come in handy Thomas.

42:21.620 --> 42:23.620
Anyway

42:23.620 --> 42:25.620
Anyway I passed.

42:25.620 --> 42:27.620
Congratulations.

42:27.620 --> 42:29.620
Thank you. You drop off

42:29.620 --> 42:31.620
this flash and this

42:31.620 --> 42:33.620
smoke and flash.

42:33.620 --> 42:35.620
So the flash grenade is hopefully gonna

42:35.620 --> 42:37.620
I mean it's a big concussive thing.

42:37.620 --> 42:39.620
Hopefully that's gonna fuck up his

42:39.620 --> 42:41.620
insides and while he's in

42:41.620 --> 42:43.620
the water and then

42:43.620 --> 42:45.620
if it doesn't

42:45.620 --> 42:47.620
I hope the smoke grenade makes his tummy real

42:47.620 --> 42:49.620
upset. Yeah no doubt.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.620
Like if you swallowed a cherry bomb.

42:51.620 --> 42:53.620
That would be so gross. I can't even

42:53.620 --> 42:55.620
imagine what that would feel like.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.620
Just like

42:57.620 --> 42:59.620
like dry smoke

42:59.620 --> 43:01.620
billowing through your soft insides.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.620
What you have to do is implant

43:03.620 --> 43:05.620
one into your guts and leave the fuse

43:05.620 --> 43:07.620
sticking out of your belly button and then you can

43:07.620 --> 43:09.620
light it. That's what the belly button is for.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.620
That's what the pros do.

43:13.620 --> 43:15.620
Yeah what do I do

43:15.620 --> 43:17.620
to this fish man? Well I think you swim

43:17.620 --> 43:19.620
out of it but you are now being

43:19.620 --> 43:21.620
birthed out of the side

43:21.620 --> 43:23.620
of this massive creature out of

43:23.620 --> 43:25.620
the same hole

43:25.620 --> 43:27.620
that Keith Vigna

43:27.620 --> 43:29.620
came out of. Was once birthed from.

43:29.620 --> 43:31.620
Previously and as you

43:31.620 --> 43:33.620
as you

43:33.620 --> 43:35.620
I think you're gonna have to get birthed from this fish thing.

43:35.620 --> 43:37.620
To get on our

43:37.620 --> 43:39.620
spiritual level. Otherwise

43:39.620 --> 43:41.620
we're just gonna leave you in the dust.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.620
Like on the astral plane.

43:43.620 --> 43:45.620
As you

43:45.620 --> 43:47.620
come out of it you feel this

43:47.620 --> 43:49.620
other body follow you through

43:49.620 --> 43:51.620
the hole and you begin to swim

43:51.620 --> 43:53.620
out of the creature.

43:53.620 --> 43:55.620
I hope it's just the corpse of that dude.

43:55.620 --> 43:57.620
It doesn't sound like it's corpse. I guess it could have

43:57.620 --> 43:59.620
just floated out.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.620
Clark you got a fish man on you man.

44:05.620 --> 44:07.620
Right now in this room.

44:07.620 --> 44:09.620
There's one still

44:09.620 --> 44:11.620
standing guard at the elevator and

44:11.620 --> 44:13.620
the other one is standing right in front of

44:13.620 --> 44:15.620
Clark Bishop and he is going

44:15.620 --> 44:17.620
to attack you.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.620
And he fucking

44:19.620 --> 44:21.620
fails. Oh thank god. This is absurd.

44:21.620 --> 44:23.620
This is absurd.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.620
This is positively absurd. As soon as it

44:25.620 --> 44:27.620
like pulls the scythe into position

44:27.620 --> 44:29.620
to swing at you it kind of loses

44:29.620 --> 44:31.620
grip of the thing and just kind of grabs

44:31.620 --> 44:33.620
it on the end with one hand and then just

44:33.620 --> 44:35.620
kind of swings it down at you and

44:35.620 --> 44:37.620
the stick part just kind of hits you in the arm.

44:37.620 --> 44:39.620
Yep.

44:39.620 --> 44:41.620
That's it.

44:41.620 --> 44:43.620
That's all that happens.

44:43.620 --> 44:45.620
And the other one is going to

44:45.620 --> 44:47.620
move closer

44:47.620 --> 44:49.620
to the elevator door. With that it's

44:49.620 --> 44:51.620
Clark Bishop's turn. Really?

44:51.620 --> 44:53.620
Nope. I didn't

44:53.620 --> 44:55.620
make an initiative tracker for

44:55.620 --> 44:57.620
myself. I was like oh I can totally

44:57.620 --> 44:59.620
do this by memory.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.620
Nope. Thomas you

45:01.620 --> 45:03.620
you hear a noise

45:03.620 --> 45:05.620
as you come out of

45:05.620 --> 45:07.620
this creature.

45:07.620 --> 45:09.620
And as

45:09.620 --> 45:11.620
you're swimming away

45:11.620 --> 45:13.620
you feel something grip

45:13.620 --> 45:15.620
one of your legs.

45:15.620 --> 45:17.620
Nevermind Zach it was

45:17.620 --> 45:19.620
my turn.

45:31.620 --> 45:33.620
Thomas you're in this water

45:33.620 --> 45:35.620
you just swam away from this

45:35.620 --> 45:37.620
creature that you were birthed

45:37.620 --> 45:39.620
out of and you feel

45:39.620 --> 45:41.620
something grab your leg.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.620
You turn around. No I

45:43.620 --> 45:45.620
kick as hard as I can. You kick as hard

45:45.620 --> 45:47.620
as you can. Go ahead and roll

45:47.620 --> 45:49.620
unarmed combat.

45:49.620 --> 45:51.620
80 on

45:51.620 --> 45:53.620
a 40.

45:53.620 --> 45:55.620
You kick as hard as you can and you feel

45:55.620 --> 45:57.620
the restraint that your

45:57.620 --> 45:59.620
leg has as if you

45:59.620 --> 46:01.620
cannot move it at

46:01.620 --> 46:03.620
all. I didn't sign up for no

46:03.620 --> 46:05.620
water zombies.

46:05.620 --> 46:07.620
Do you try to continue swimming or do

46:07.620 --> 46:09.620
you turn and look? I turn

46:09.620 --> 46:11.620
and look. When you turn and look

46:11.620 --> 46:13.620
you can only see

46:13.620 --> 46:15.620
the murky water that is

46:15.620 --> 46:17.620
around you. You can't make out

46:17.620 --> 46:19.620
where your leg is

46:19.620 --> 46:21.620
in the water. The water

46:21.620 --> 46:23.620
is too opaque

46:23.620 --> 46:25.620
in its nastiness.

46:25.620 --> 46:27.620
Okay so I grab back on whatever's

46:27.620 --> 46:29.620
grabbing to me and try to pull myself

46:29.620 --> 46:31.620
it. Okay like if it's a hand or something

46:31.620 --> 46:33.620
I grab that wrist and yank myself

46:33.620 --> 46:35.620
to it so I can see. Awesome.

46:35.620 --> 46:37.620
Go ahead and roll unarmed combat again.

46:39.620 --> 46:41.620
94.

46:41.620 --> 46:43.620
Got another success.

46:43.620 --> 46:45.620
You actually can use

46:45.620 --> 46:47.620
your ankle as a steady point

46:47.620 --> 46:49.620
a held point in this

46:49.620 --> 46:51.620
water and you can move

46:51.620 --> 46:53.620
your like doing a crunch

46:53.620 --> 46:55.620
to grab at what is underneath

46:55.620 --> 46:57.620
and you feel

46:57.620 --> 46:59.620
nothing

46:59.620 --> 47:01.620
on your legs, on your

47:01.620 --> 47:03.620
feet but something unseen

47:03.620 --> 47:05.620
is holding you in

47:05.620 --> 47:07.620
place. I need you to roll a sanity

47:07.620 --> 47:09.620
check.

47:09.620 --> 47:11.620
90. Fail. You lose

47:11.620 --> 47:13.620
and failed over my power. You lose

47:13.620 --> 47:15.620
control of your

47:15.620 --> 47:17.620
body and

47:17.620 --> 47:19.620
you lose control

47:19.620 --> 47:21.620
of your mind. You're gonna

47:21.620 --> 47:23.620
lose one sanity and your

47:23.620 --> 47:25.620
mind is splitting itself

47:25.620 --> 47:27.620
away from your body. The John

47:27.620 --> 47:29.620
Lee Pettymore part of you

47:29.620 --> 47:31.620
and the physical Kevin

47:31.620 --> 47:33.620
that you embody are at

47:33.620 --> 47:35.620
odds. No this isn't right.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.620
Where am I? What's going on

47:37.620 --> 47:39.620
down here? That's happening in my mind.

47:39.620 --> 47:41.620
John is starting to

47:41.620 --> 47:43.620
wake up a little bit inside of Kevin

47:43.620 --> 47:45.620
and he's forgotten a little bit. Yeah.

47:45.620 --> 47:47.620
I need you to roll 4d6 for the

47:47.620 --> 47:49.620
damage that you left

47:49.620 --> 47:51.620
inside of this creature.

47:51.620 --> 47:53.620
Good thing we just played tiny d6 for the Patreon.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.620
Plenty of d6's to go around.

47:55.620 --> 47:57.620
4 he said? 4.

47:57.620 --> 47:59.620
3 6's

47:59.620 --> 48:01.620
and a 2. Holy shit.

48:01.620 --> 48:03.620
So you see this

48:03.620 --> 48:05.620
absolute explosion.

48:05.620 --> 48:07.620
It's like water shockwave

48:07.620 --> 48:09.620
like wooo. Exactly.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.620
And it actually it lights up

48:11.620 --> 48:13.620
the murky water that you're in.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.620
Looking down there is absolutely

48:15.620 --> 48:17.620
nothing holding on to you but

48:17.620 --> 48:19.620
swimming away

48:19.620 --> 48:21.620
you do see there is a

48:21.620 --> 48:23.620
little fish head about

48:23.620 --> 48:25.620
the size of a softball

48:25.620 --> 48:27.620
that is on a human

48:27.620 --> 48:29.620
body the size of a Barbie

48:29.620 --> 48:31.620
doll and it is

48:31.620 --> 48:33.620
awkwardly swimming. Don't like

48:33.620 --> 48:35.620
anything about that. I need you

48:35.620 --> 48:37.620
to make a constitution

48:37.620 --> 48:39.620
check because you've been in the

48:39.620 --> 48:41.620
water for some time

48:41.620 --> 48:43.620
and I looked up the rules

48:43.620 --> 48:45.620
for suffocation.

48:45.620 --> 48:47.620
Now you look up the rules.

48:47.620 --> 48:49.620
36 on a

48:49.620 --> 48:51.620
50. Alrighty.

48:51.620 --> 48:53.620
So you only take 1 hit point of damage.

48:53.620 --> 48:55.620
Okay that brings me down to 4. Oof.

48:55.620 --> 48:57.620
Now I need you to roll a power

48:57.620 --> 48:59.620
check.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.620
Fail.

49:01.620 --> 49:03.620
89 on a 60.

49:03.620 --> 49:05.620
That hand that you felt

49:05.620 --> 49:07.620
on your leg rips you

49:07.620 --> 49:09.620
downward.

49:09.620 --> 49:11.620
And you feel water just

49:11.620 --> 49:13.620
rushing up your nose.

49:13.620 --> 49:15.620
And I need you to roll another

49:15.620 --> 49:17.620
constitution check.

49:17.620 --> 49:19.620
36 pass.

49:19.620 --> 49:21.620
Lose 1 more hit point of

49:21.620 --> 49:23.620
damage. As we

49:23.620 --> 49:25.620
roll for power again this

49:25.620 --> 49:27.620
unseen force continues

49:27.620 --> 49:29.620
to try to drag you to the bottom

49:29.620 --> 49:31.620
of this tank. Maybe it wants to

49:31.620 --> 49:33.620
take me someplace safe. Maybe it should just go with it.

49:33.620 --> 49:35.620
It wants to take you someplace safe.

49:35.620 --> 49:37.620
12 I pass.

49:37.620 --> 49:39.620
21 I pass.

49:39.620 --> 49:41.620
I need you to roll another

49:41.620 --> 49:43.620
constitution check.

49:43.620 --> 49:45.620
52 on a 60 I pass.

49:45.620 --> 49:47.620
Lose another hit point of damage.

49:47.620 --> 49:49.620
2.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.620
2? Yeah that's what I meant.

49:51.620 --> 49:53.620
Because you're down at 2 hit points we need to roll

49:53.620 --> 49:55.620
constitution to see if you can stay

49:55.620 --> 49:57.620
conscious.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.620
No. 71 on

49:59.620 --> 50:01.620
a 50. This unseen

50:01.620 --> 50:03.620
force drags you and

50:03.620 --> 50:05.620
drags you down to the bottom

50:05.620 --> 50:07.620
and slams your body

50:07.620 --> 50:09.620
up against

50:09.620 --> 50:11.620
a hard surface.

50:11.620 --> 50:13.620
Your eyes

50:13.620 --> 50:15.620
open up

50:15.620 --> 50:17.620
and in front of you on the

50:17.620 --> 50:19.620
other side of this

50:19.620 --> 50:21.620
glass

50:21.620 --> 50:23.620
you see

50:23.620 --> 50:25.620
Marvin staring

50:25.620 --> 50:27.620
straight back at you.

50:27.620 --> 50:29.620
You've been in his office before

50:29.620 --> 50:31.620
and that is where he is standing.

50:31.620 --> 50:33.620
And he

50:33.620 --> 50:35.620
has his hand up

50:35.620 --> 50:37.620
and the orifice on his face

50:37.620 --> 50:39.620
tries its

50:39.620 --> 50:41.620
hardest to make a smile

50:41.620 --> 50:43.620
as your lungs

50:43.620 --> 50:45.620
fill with water.

50:45.620 --> 50:47.620
Glub.

50:47.620 --> 50:49.620
So ends

50:49.620 --> 50:51.620
John Lee Pettymore.

51:11.620 --> 51:13.620
The only one

51:13.620 --> 51:15.620
trying to

51:15.620 --> 51:17.620
pull over

51:17.620 --> 51:19.620
How can you

51:19.620 --> 51:21.620
have enough

51:21.620 --> 51:23.620
drowning out

51:23.620 --> 51:25.620
of the noise

51:27.620 --> 51:29.620
Cause nobody

51:29.620 --> 51:31.620
knows

51:31.620 --> 51:33.620
nobody

51:33.620 --> 51:35.620
knows

51:35.620 --> 51:37.620
nobody

51:37.620 --> 51:39.620
knows

51:39.620 --> 51:41.620
nobody

51:41.620 --> 51:43.620
dies
