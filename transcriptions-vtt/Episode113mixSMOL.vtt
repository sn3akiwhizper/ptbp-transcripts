00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
What's up everybody? It's Zach. I am Zach and I want to pop in here real quick before this,

00:05.760 --> 00:12.720
the finale of season one with a few announcements. First, this is the last episode. I worked really

00:12.720 --> 00:18.480
hard on it. We've had a stupid amount of fun making this show and we are super proud of what

00:18.480 --> 00:24.560
we've created together this season. Thank you each and every one of you for listening, telling your

00:24.560 --> 00:30.320
friends, posting about the show, creating art based on these characters. I really truly didn't

00:30.320 --> 00:37.280
expect it. This community absolutely rules. Next, we're going to do a couple Q&A episodes here on

00:37.280 --> 00:45.120
the main feed. So please comment your questions in the stickied post on the subreddit or you can tag

00:45.120 --> 00:54.400
at pretending pod on Twitter and use the hashtag PTBPQ. That is hashtag PTBPQ in order to give you

00:54.400 --> 01:00.080
time to ponder what questions to fling at us and in order to give me some time to catch up on some

01:00.080 --> 01:07.040
things. Those Q&A episodes should come out October 22nd and October 29th. So if you have any

01:07.040 --> 01:13.120
questions, comments, or compliments, find that post in the subreddit or tag us on Twitter at pretending

01:13.120 --> 01:22.480
pod with the hashtag PTBPQ. Hashtag PTBPQ. Finally, we are changing one of our Patreon tiers.

01:22.480 --> 01:29.680
A Splashylvania Fastpass is still only $5. You still get access to all 24 of our bonus episodes

01:29.680 --> 01:37.680
and it's still only $6.66 if you want the same stuff but also you're rad. The cover charge at

01:37.680 --> 01:44.240
the Den of Sin is still $15 if you dare join us behind the scenes as we record our Patreon bonus

01:44.240 --> 01:49.040
episodes and we finish out those streams by hanging out with the chat and playing some Jackbox.

01:49.040 --> 01:57.760
But there's a new tier in town. For $25, you can join the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club.

01:57.760 --> 02:03.120
Once you're in the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club, you can choose and receive a Patreon exclusive

02:03.120 --> 02:09.680
shirt from a rotating pool of designs like the Splashylvania Vampire on a Surfboard shirt,

02:09.680 --> 02:17.040
the four items from the Trunk shirt, and the Den of Sin Juice Box shirt. These pieces were created

02:17.040 --> 02:24.400
respectively by Sean McFarland at slide.whistle and Andy Corbett. Check him out on Instagram,

02:24.400 --> 02:30.000
Twitter, Facebook, or Patreon and then follow these dope artists and support them too.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.840
And here's a sweet little deal for those of you listening as this is being released. If you join

02:35.840 --> 02:39.840
the Circle of Knowledge Shirt Club or a higher tier in the month of October,

02:39.840 --> 02:47.360
we'll count this month as your second month in that tier. A whole month closer to that sweet,

02:47.360 --> 02:55.520
sweet t-shirt. And extra finally, we are going to do a live stream for all our patrons over at

02:55.520 --> 03:03.200
patreon.com slash pretending pod this upcoming Tuesday, October 12th at 9pm central time. Taylor

03:03.200 --> 03:08.560
and I brought back some snacks from Korea for the boys to try, so join us for a super relaxed hang

03:08.560 --> 03:14.080
for a couple hours. We'll try some snacks, shoot the shit, and answer some questions. That stream

03:14.080 --> 03:22.000
and a link to the playback will be available to all patrons. So, make it happen. And as Wolf says,

03:22.000 --> 03:28.400
all the links are in the show notes. Now, back to you, Wolfie. Wolfie, Wolfie.

03:28.400 --> 03:37.520
Well, well, well. Look who finally showed up to the grease pit. It's you, my beautiful child.

03:37.520 --> 03:46.080
Join me in the barrel. Take a load off. Uh, wait, no, don't. Get hyped. Because you are

03:46.160 --> 03:55.040
tuned into the biggest, baddest radio station on this dimensions block. 694.2 PTBP.

03:56.640 --> 04:03.520
We got a new Howlin' with Wolf this week, and it comes from someone named Curtain Plastic,

04:03.520 --> 04:09.360
who did the most damnedest, gosh darn dirtiest, delicious, dutiful thing you can do.

04:10.240 --> 04:17.520
She wrote us a five-star review on Apple Podcasts. Hell yeah, dude. She writes,

04:17.520 --> 04:23.200
I would like to shout out my D&D group, who I hope will soon dive into the world of Delta

04:23.200 --> 04:33.120
Green with me. Shout out to my two amazing DMs, Zach and Nick. To my fellow player, Will,

04:33.120 --> 04:40.960
and to the love of my life, who I'm honored to roleplay in more than one way with Lucas.

04:40.960 --> 04:47.520
Also, shout out to Zach, Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Justin for all the hard work and time

04:47.520 --> 04:55.360
y'all have put into this. Y'all are fucking killing it. Well, thanks, Curtain Plastic.

04:55.360 --> 05:02.960
But I, uh, can't help but notice that you didn't include little old Wolfie in your shout out list.

05:03.520 --> 05:10.000
I'm gonna assume it's because, uh, we all just know who really makes the show so great.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.200
It's, uh, me is who. And my producer, somewhat, I guess. And now I want to let it be known,

05:17.200 --> 05:25.200
I have never been invited to a D&D group. Not a single time. And I still don't really know

05:25.200 --> 05:32.160
what the hell y'all are doing in these groups. And honestly, it freaks me the freak out. So I never

05:32.160 --> 05:39.200
ask. Y'all, when Instagram went down, a part of me rejoiced because finally all of y'all were living

05:39.200 --> 05:45.600
in Wolfie's world. The other part of me that is bound by my producer's contract is here to tell

05:45.600 --> 05:52.560
you to follow along and tag the show at pretending pod. There's even a handy link in the show notes

05:52.560 --> 06:04.640
for now. Because the internet, Gambino Nice, might go down again. Ooh, spooky.

06:05.920 --> 06:13.920
We're proud to have a new sponsor here at 694.2 PTBP. I think this sponsor is very good and

06:13.920 --> 06:21.680
necessary. So this week's news segment is brought to you by Fuck Mark Zuckerberg. It's time for the

06:21.680 --> 06:29.600
news. Last time, Keith turned into Keith's and eliminated the threat of the wormy ceiling.

06:29.600 --> 06:37.040
Pretty straightforward stuff, I'd say. And now for the last time, an absolute banger.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.200
It's Dragon in Three with What Kind of World Are You Living In?

06:41.200 --> 06:55.600
Bad girls on top of the water. Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline.

06:55.600 --> 07:04.320
Leaving my mind at your altar. Crossing the double line, doing it every time. Tell me what

07:04.320 --> 07:17.440
kind of world are you living in? What kind of world are you living in?

07:23.120 --> 07:26.880
Was that your fingers? That's like definitely 30 seconds.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.640
I didn't think it was going to be that loud.

07:28.640 --> 07:34.800
Dude, why would you do anything that made sound?

07:36.800 --> 07:39.440
Because I was like, I don't know. In the only 30 seconds.

07:41.360 --> 07:48.000
This will be an excellent time to pop my nuts. Honestly, that's the thought that went through

07:48.000 --> 07:51.280
my mind. I'm like, I'm going to do it right now. It's nice and quiet now.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.160
It's going to be so loud. I think maybe subconsciously I was like,

07:56.800 --> 08:00.080
let's see how loud it is. When you were a kid at school and

08:00.080 --> 08:05.120
they made you do 30 seconds of silence at school, did you pop your knuckles during that?

08:05.120 --> 08:11.440
No, I was a super follow the rules kind of kid. Before they recorded your glasses?

08:12.240 --> 08:15.040
What the fuck are you talking about? Well, you got to get room noise.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.800
Just one day out of the year really needed room noise.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.840
I'm recording you all. Class, as you know, it's September 11th today and we need to get room

08:23.840 --> 08:28.960
noise. Class, as you know, this is a two-party consent state, so I am informing you that you

08:28.960 --> 08:34.240
are being recorded. If any of you little fuckers have a problem with that, you speak up now.

08:34.240 --> 08:39.920
And then they read Where the Redfern Grows audiobook. They're recording the audiobook.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.000
Yeah. Damn it.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.680
All right, you guys ready to start? No.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.520
Am I on a big TV again? Yeah.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.760
Yeah. Am I full screen?

08:52.320 --> 08:56.560
You are. You're like almost life-sized. You're like three-quarter Justin.

08:56.560 --> 09:02.000
Your beard mustache looks incredible. There's not really a beard anymore, right?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.800
Well, it's like chops. Chops mustache.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.000
Yeah. Burns mustache.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.920
When this is gone, is a beard a beard if there is no chin in the hair?

09:09.920 --> 09:13.280
You don't have a beard. No, you have long side burns into a mustache with a little dopey.

09:13.280 --> 09:17.120
Dude, your mustache connects to your burns. I think you've got a beard.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.560
I don't think you have a beard. Oh, is that the differentiator?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.440
I would call what you have right now. I wouldn't call it a beard.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.240
Almost a beard. I don't know. I would call it a beard.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.360
I disagree. You don't have a beard right now. It's a variety of beard.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.200
I like it though. This internet website

09:33.200 --> 09:38.880
claims that that style of facial hair is called Friendly Mutton Chops.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.960
Oh, I don't like that name at all. I do.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.920
I feel like mutton chops, once you've got chops, that's a beard, not just sideburns.

09:48.000 --> 09:57.040
I feel like mutton chops are not grown down. If your hair was longer, you know what I mean?

09:58.640 --> 10:03.120
If you think of a dude with a mutton chop thing. I'm thinking Red Dead style mutton chops.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.160
We'll have to take a group picture. If you take the mutton chops down to a two,

10:06.160 --> 10:09.840
then you've got what he's got. Those are lamb chops.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.000
You've got lamb chops. I like lamb chops.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.880
Gentlemen, lamb chops. We'll have to take a group picture with the TV.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.760
Yes. That'll be fun.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.240
Oh, goodness.

10:21.680 --> 10:26.880
Oh, it just froze on Zach whenever you went, like when you started laughing and it faded.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.920
It went like... You went like...

10:32.960 --> 10:34.320
Get a good Jimmy Carr laugh in there.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.080
That's not... It's a little bit...

10:42.080 --> 10:48.080
It starts... He's hawking from the beginning.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.400
It's more staccato though. There's bigger breaks.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.840
It sounds so fake.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.640
Not knowing what Jimmy Carr's laugh sounds like.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.200
Did we nail it?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.160
That was great.

11:06.160 --> 11:10.480
It's a weird thing, but I didn't even notice that was a thing until I saw that video,

11:10.480 --> 11:11.600
like compilation of it.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.680
I was like, he's got a hearty laugh. He's a jovial man.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.920
And then I saw that and I was like, oh yeah, that's fucking weird.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.960
We've come to the end, guys.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.760
I mean, we're not there yet. We have an episode to go.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.320
But this is that.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.360
This is that episode.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.000
Is this 113?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.080
I bet we can drag this out for two or three more.

11:34.880 --> 11:35.920
I don't think so, man.

11:35.920 --> 11:41.680
When we started, I don't know what number I had in my head, but I don't think it was this many.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.680
For one season.

11:43.680 --> 11:48.320
I think I told you guys in the forties, mid forties.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.320
I'm glad it's been this long, though.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.360
We've done a lot of stuff.

11:51.360 --> 11:54.960
It's also been a running thing that you would often say to us,

11:54.960 --> 11:57.360
okay, this next part's going to take an episode.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.520
And then that next part would be five episodes.

12:01.280 --> 12:05.840
That's also a running thing from our very first role-playing games together,

12:05.840 --> 12:07.600
where you're like, I think this will take an evening.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.040
And then it took a month.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.160
Exactly, yep.

12:10.160 --> 12:10.960
Oh yeah.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.720
Yeah, I forget if it was like a couple episodes ago or whatever,

12:14.720 --> 12:18.960
but listening to it where it was like, yeah, this whole time, five days.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.600
Five days, yeah, right.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.240
Which thing?

12:22.240 --> 12:24.080
We did go back in time a couple times.

12:24.960 --> 12:25.440
That's true.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.800
It's more like a few hundred years.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.520
We had to offshoot.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.960
This one in particular makes sense for as far as five days ago.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.240
We relived that one afternoon.

12:34.240 --> 12:34.740
A lot.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.560
At least we never went to a Waffle House and made our orders in character,

12:40.720 --> 12:45.200
like we made Zach listen to one time at our home session.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.080
It was like the first campaign that we were running,

12:48.080 --> 12:52.080
and before you even dove into the scenario at hall,

12:52.080 --> 12:54.080
you were like, our characters are probably hungry.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.360
It was when we thought about sleeping and eating food.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.960
So I was like, okay, let's go to this Waffle House.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.800
And I wanted pancakes.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.040
You guys want to go to Waffle House after this?

13:05.040 --> 13:05.540
No.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.360
Luke wanted pancakes, so then they had to go across the street.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.400
I think it was the pancake palace, I'm pretty sure.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.720
Yeah, it wasn't a Waffle House, it was a pancake palace.

13:14.720 --> 13:21.440
And then we went through a full round of ordering breakfast foods and drinks

13:21.440 --> 13:22.960
where I just played your server.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.680
Did you like that?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.960
Yes, it's my favorite role-playing moment of all time.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.240
I wish I was at Waffle House right now,

13:32.240 --> 13:34.640
and I'm pretty pissed Luke said he didn't want to get it after this.

13:34.640 --> 13:40.880
You didn't want to celebrate the end of recording season one with a trip to Waffle House?

13:43.840 --> 13:45.760
That is so incomprehensible to me.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.040
I eat Waffle House for lunch sometimes,

13:49.040 --> 13:51.040
because it's like right down the street from my work,

13:51.680 --> 13:53.200
and I'm sad every time I do.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.640
Are you getting dope waffles and eggs,

13:56.640 --> 13:58.960
or are you getting a sensible lunch meal?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.640
No, I get breakfast food every time.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.600
Breakfast food.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.720
Breakfast food.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.760
Breakfast food?

14:04.400 --> 14:06.960
If you don't like their eggs, hash browns, and waffles...

14:06.960 --> 14:09.120
Hey, I'm not saying I don't like it.

14:09.120 --> 14:15.120
I'm saying when I go there by myself at 12 30 on a Tuesday,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.400
I'm a little bit sad.

14:16.400 --> 14:16.960
You get the blue mood.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.680
Yeah, but is that like a pre-existing condition or...

14:19.680 --> 14:23.840
I get the blue mood and the waitress comes up she's like,

14:23.840 --> 14:24.960
you got sweaty blood.

14:26.720 --> 14:27.040
Okay.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.960
I know, give me the fucking hash browns.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.080
You're telling me you still have the blue mood after the waitress calls you hun.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.680
Yeah, I say I want the hash browns chopped and screwed.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.760
What is your Waffle House hash brown order, Joe?

14:43.760 --> 14:45.840
Smothered, covered, diced, I think is what I do.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.240
Luke?

14:46.240 --> 14:47.920
Smothered, covered, capped.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.720
Smothered, covered.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.760
Scattered, covered, smothered.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.320
What, scattered?

14:51.040 --> 14:51.520
Crispy.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.440
Where it's all crispy, yeah.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.800
So I think that's a holdover, because you can ask for ring also.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.800
I think you get scattered if you don't ask for ring.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.800
No, it specifically says scattered like crispy.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.920
Because they make it thinner so that it all gets the even coating.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.440
I like the crisp on top and I like that little mushy underneath.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.680
I like a little mush to it.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.200
I like almost like a cake, like a latke.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.240
Justin, do you have a Waffle House hash brown order?

15:18.240 --> 15:22.160
I just get them extra crispy and then I throw salt and pepper and ketchup on them,

15:22.160 --> 15:23.120
because I'm a monster.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.960
I throw a Tabasco sauce on there.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.080
Tabasco, that's right.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.600
A little hot sauce too, yeah.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.200
I generally like to mix them up with my over-easy eggs

15:31.200 --> 15:32.640
and get all that yolk up in the hash browns.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.600
There's your problem, dude.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.760
You're not getting them scrambled cheesy eggs.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.400
I'm a big mix all your food together type of guy.

15:38.400 --> 15:38.880
Hard saying.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.920
Yeah, my eggs go right on top of those hash browns as soon as it arrives.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.720
Flop them.

15:44.720 --> 15:45.600
Flop them on top.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.680
Dude, I went to W.F. Cody's for lunch today.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.720
Love W.F. Cody's.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.840
I ordered a half pound Larry Burger, which is-

15:53.840 --> 15:54.720
That's the one to get.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.200
Yeah, with American cheese, fried egg.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.960
It was packed in there.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.200
I had to like sit at the bar at a-

16:01.200 --> 16:03.520
You found this tiny chair that was just sitting in the corner.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.480
Well, I was sitting right next to the touch tunes thing,

16:06.480 --> 16:08.080
which is super fucking annoying,

16:08.080 --> 16:10.800
because there was a bunch of drunk people in there at-

16:10.800 --> 16:11.600
This is lunch?

16:11.600 --> 16:12.640
This is 1230.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.920
Oh, it's W.F. Cody's.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.420
Yeah.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.240
Bunch of drunk people playing pool like trying to like shove me out of the way

16:20.240 --> 16:22.160
so that they could play their touch tunes next.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.360
Anyway, she brings out the full pound burger and I'm like,

16:25.360 --> 16:26.880
I didn't order that.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.160
And she's like, oh, sorry.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.760
I just rang it in wrong.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.240
Did you want to eat all this meat?

16:32.240 --> 16:37.600
I'm like, I eat it, but I don't want to pay seven extra dollars for it.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.520
And she's like, just eat it.

16:39.520 --> 16:43.120
I ate the whole fucking thing and I felt like shit all the rest of the day.

16:43.120 --> 16:43.760
Yeah, dude.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.120
Half a pound is like too big.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.080
Half a pound is a lot, man.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.400
I ate a whole one pound burger and most of the fries that came with it.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.160
Well, I guess it's a double quarter pounder.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.120
Hungry boy.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.160
I ate a quadruple quarter pounder.

16:56.160 --> 16:56.660
Yeah.

16:58.640 --> 17:05.040
I actually celebrated my 21st birthday at W.F. Cody's when I was 18 years old.

17:05.840 --> 17:09.040
At 1230 in the afternoon.

17:09.680 --> 17:14.640
We went in and like, they just sang me happy birthday and we did the whole thing

17:14.640 --> 17:16.640
and they brought shots out for us.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.400
Well, you just said you were 21.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.920
We could probably go do that now.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.520
Who's turning 21?

17:23.520 --> 17:23.920
You?

17:23.920 --> 17:24.320
Sure.

17:24.320 --> 17:24.560
Yeah.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.120
Whatever.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.720
As long as you're singing happy birthday.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.480
I mean, if anybody's turning 21, it's me.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.600
Yeah, it would be Lukey.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.480
And I would say just give me a full one pound burger.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.360
I'm down to eat two pounds of meat today.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.720
Two pounds of burger today.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.800
Okay, so we've got you guys in this realm that you've been in.

17:40.800 --> 17:41.920
I think that was good for an episode.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.760
Okay, yeah, let's wrap it here.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.960
Let's 113.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.080
We'll see you all.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.840
It'll be a couple of weeks before 114.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.960
Actually, I think finale 120.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.840
That sounds good.

17:51.840 --> 17:57.680
I think finale 120 and the next, what, six episodes recap of the whole thing.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.200
And then we'll do the finale.

18:03.200 --> 18:03.760
The actual finale.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.640
Well, no, no, no.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.520
What I think we should do is this should just be the finale.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.160
We'll see how that goes.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.720
We'll put that out and be like episode 113 is the finale and then never release an episode.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.760
Oh, that's fun.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.880
That's a lot of fun.

18:20.880 --> 18:28.000
That would really fuck with some people disappear and become like insurance salesman and

18:31.680 --> 18:34.400
bankers, bankers, bankers.

18:34.400 --> 18:40.480
It's so, so, so dark in this waffle house.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.720
I feel God.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.880
In this waffle house.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.920
I'm going to be an asshole and say, I got to, let me just piss before we actually

18:51.920 --> 18:55.760
get into the, we're in a good, like we're rolling here.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.320
It's been hot.

18:58.640 --> 19:10.400
It is so dark here and you feel so content and so strange this whole time you felt this way,

19:10.400 --> 19:18.640
but there was so much going on, so much stress, so much noise, so many threats challenging

19:18.640 --> 19:22.400
what the rest of your lives, your existence will be.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.480
Not only your existence, but the existence of everyone you've ever known.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.120
And not only the individuals that you've come into contact with, but every version

19:32.160 --> 19:35.840
of those individuals and every version of yourselves.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.600
That's all been at risk until now.

19:41.040 --> 19:46.880
The voices of the Keiths ring out almost infinitely.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.720
It's just one of them eating it.

19:53.840 --> 19:58.000
They've somehow manifested it into all of their hands.

19:58.640 --> 19:58.880
Okay.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.280
Now it brought the Oreo McFlurry in the first place.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.800
You think myriad can't get itself an Oreo fucking McFlurry.

20:04.800 --> 20:10.240
So Keith, as myriad, have you changed the physical appearance of

20:10.320 --> 20:11.040
these creatures?

20:13.040 --> 20:18.960
As a myriad was popping in, they were popping in in the form of Keith.

20:19.920 --> 20:29.120
Keith, who was in the body of the myriad that he had switched into within seconds, minutes,

20:29.120 --> 20:30.880
had switched forms.

20:31.520 --> 20:40.240
Every myriad is Keith, but Keith's body, inhabited by myriad, is also still Keith.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.040
Right.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.600
So do you know where that is, or has he wandered off into the crowd of Keiths?

20:45.600 --> 20:46.400
Oh, no.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.320
He's the only one without a McFlurry.

20:48.320 --> 20:48.560
Yeah.

20:49.200 --> 20:49.920
Yes.

20:49.920 --> 20:57.120
The only Keith without a McFlurry is myriad Keith, and Keiths are keeping an eye on it.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.320
As he was copping about trying to get used to his body,

21:01.120 --> 21:06.240
Keith in the body of myriad just slides by and lifts the McFlurry out of his hand.

21:06.960 --> 21:07.840
Oh, yeah.

21:07.840 --> 21:14.480
Well, as soon as myriad Keiths took the McFlurry out of Keith,

21:18.080 --> 21:20.560
then every myriad Keith had a McFlurry in there.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.160
Had a McFlurry, of course.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.440
What are the Keiths wearing?

21:24.240 --> 21:27.440
Refer back to episode one of pretending to be people.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.320
I just did.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.200
Police uniform.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.080
Pants are too big.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.720
Big old bridges.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.600
Big old bridges.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.280
Well, most of them are wearing that.

21:33.280 --> 21:39.120
Some of them are wearing too tight polo with way too big cargo shorts.

21:39.120 --> 21:44.320
Some are wearing the other things that Keith has worn throughout.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.200
Are there any other classic Keith outfits?

21:47.200 --> 21:51.920
Well, are there any Dan Flashes Keiths as a little wink to Keith's creator, Luke?

21:51.920 --> 21:55.120
Some of the Keiths look at some of the new ones popping in and they're like,

21:55.120 --> 21:57.040
that's a really complicated shirt.

21:57.040 --> 22:02.320
As Keith gets more confident in manifesting the myriads, he's getting fancier and fancier.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.320
They're becoming more like the true vision that Keith has of himself.

22:07.280 --> 22:14.240
And literally by the second, there's 10, 20, 40, 1,000, 10,000 Keiths popping in.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.640
But the one Keith without the McFlurry is copping around.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.480
And main Keith sits him down on the ground.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.360
And Keith is like pointing his two fingers at his eyes.

22:36.320 --> 22:36.820
Yeah.

22:44.240 --> 22:44.740
Okay.

22:48.640 --> 23:03.600
And when you look around at the boys, you see a chanting luminous land liturgy still keeping up

23:03.600 --> 23:08.560
with overclocking this Clark Bishop that has become the overseer.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.680
And you also see Clark Bishop standing nearby.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.600
You see Planet Juggernaut who is being topped by...

23:16.560 --> 23:21.360
That's not what I meant.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.880
Did you mean perhaps mounted?

23:22.880 --> 23:23.380
Mounted.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.720
Yeah, ridden hard by...

23:26.720 --> 23:29.120
A word with no connotation whatsoever.

23:29.120 --> 23:38.880
Mounted by this John that has been created out of himself, out of this muck that is dark

23:38.880 --> 23:41.840
and just wondrous collection of colors.

23:41.840 --> 23:46.160
Some of which the human eye, your specific human eyes have never been able to comprehend

23:46.160 --> 23:47.840
before are twisted in.

23:47.840 --> 23:48.400
You know what?

23:48.400 --> 23:54.000
As much as it sparkles and flashes, there's two little extra bright spots for his eyes.

23:54.000 --> 23:54.800
Oh, I love that.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.800
And he's got a cowboy hat mounting his head.

23:59.440 --> 23:59.940
Yeah.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.360
Topping his head.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.760
That is the group that you see.

24:06.560 --> 24:13.200
The only people who are here who are not chanting, the bodies of both Drew Pages...

24:13.840 --> 24:14.400
Fuck me.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.760
Drew Pages and Carrie...

24:17.760 --> 24:20.000
Drew Andrews and Carrie Pages.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.680
Keith is looking around for people that aren't Keith and he's getting pretty fucking confused

24:25.680 --> 24:27.760
because he's seeing lots of different kinds of Keiths.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.520
He's seeing fancy Keiths, expensive shirt Keiths.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.960
He's seeing big pants Keiths.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.960
And he's like, sits down, closes his eyes.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.160
All of a sudden there's only one Keith.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.360
Cool.

24:41.360 --> 24:41.920
Nice.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.520
Don, you have just, I mean...

24:45.520 --> 24:48.400
Well, so the John sacrificed itself.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.080
So I think that was the ball.

24:50.080 --> 24:50.560
Yeah.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.600
So that ball is torched.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.960
I think you're released.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.360
Yeah.

24:53.360 --> 24:57.760
Don is his own man now, once again.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.640
Yeah, as you see that skeleton of your brother or nephew.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.040
What does it look like when a, when a ball burns out?

25:05.040 --> 25:06.400
Has that happened before?

25:06.400 --> 25:11.200
No, it's just this charred one inch in diameter sphere.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.200
Like a bad marshmallow.

25:13.200 --> 25:17.840
I'm thinking of like, you know, when you burn one of those snake fireworks.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.440
That's what the whole deal looks like.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.160
Yeah.

25:20.160 --> 25:23.360
That's what I was imagining because as the huge legs, I was wondering if it just like...

25:24.480 --> 25:24.640
Yeah.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.240
It's all been kind of floating above you.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.640
And then it just, it just collapses to the ground.

25:28.640 --> 25:32.400
All made out of that snake firework material.

25:32.400 --> 25:32.880
Yes.

25:32.880 --> 25:33.600
Pure carbon.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.720
Don is like absolutely exhausted and kind of like on his hands and knees on the ground

25:40.720 --> 25:45.920
after using all of his, as much magic as he's ever used in that short amount of time

25:45.920 --> 25:47.120
in his entire life.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.840
Just emotionally overwhelmed by everything.

25:49.840 --> 25:55.920
I think he's kind of taken a breather in this second after just the complete,

25:55.920 --> 25:58.160
completely overwhelmed by everything.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.880
The wand is still in his hand and he feels a fiery glow from it for a moment.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.000
And then that fiery glow.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.000
No, he's alive in that one.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.080
Not alive.

26:10.080 --> 26:10.960
There's something.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.400
He's got a special magic wand now.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.640
Special John, a magic John wand.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.520
If you want a wand, you get your magic John wand.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.200
I know the discord said they liked when we sing,

26:21.200 --> 26:23.280
but it doesn't mean it's just like always good when we sing.

26:25.040 --> 26:25.600
Wow.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.840
Magic John, if you want to John have your magic John one.

26:29.840 --> 26:35.120
If you had a John ever magic John one, if you want to John have your magic John one.

26:36.800 --> 26:37.300
Wow.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.720
That was impressive.

26:38.720 --> 26:44.320
Keith is sitting there like he's hearing this from some like alternative plane.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.280
He's like, what the fuck is going on here?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.240
He's hearing the magic John one song.

26:50.240 --> 26:57.120
Amongst every other song that we've ever sang.

26:57.120 --> 26:58.880
Yeah, key that up now Zach.

26:58.880 --> 26:59.380
Fuck you.

27:01.440 --> 27:06.480
Can Don in fact feel like the presence of John in this?

27:06.480 --> 27:07.840
Yeah, you can feel John in this wand.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.120
I feel God in this waffle house.

27:12.080 --> 27:12.560
Nailed it.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.600
I think it's just, you feel, you know, you've got like a magic sword.

27:15.600 --> 27:21.520
I think Don clutches it close to his chest kind of as he's like crumpled over a little bit

27:21.520 --> 27:25.840
with like the little embers still burning a little bit from the wand.

27:26.400 --> 27:26.900
Drew!

27:28.560 --> 27:29.060
Drew!

27:31.440 --> 27:32.400
Don't you know everything?

27:32.400 --> 27:33.600
Can't you just look at him?

27:36.800 --> 27:37.440
Keith is not.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.200
He's not grown accustomed to.

27:39.200 --> 27:44.640
It's been literally seconds or minutes since he's been in this.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.840
The body of Kerry pages runs up to you and is like, hello.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.640
Hello, sir.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.280
Oh my God.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.640
Oh my God.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.840
It is so good to see.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.720
And they'll shut up.

27:54.160 --> 27:59.120
And Keith is just like rubbing his head because in Keith's mind he's just hearing things from

27:59.120 --> 28:02.400
different planes of reality and it's really fucking him up.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.040
And he points at the radio.

28:08.320 --> 28:08.960
Get Kerry.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.160
Get Kerry.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.800
Councilwoman Kerry pages here.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.440
And if you are willing to make.

28:15.440 --> 28:15.940
Shut up.

28:16.800 --> 28:22.320
And Keith pops up and just hands the radio to Drew.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.080
Pushes the two together and flips the switch.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.200
How are you powering it?

28:27.840 --> 28:29.280
It's still broken technically.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.880
So it needs some ooze inside.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.320
Three or four Keith's pop up handfuls of ooze.

28:37.760 --> 28:41.680
They slam some ooze into this glass chamber that's shattered.

28:41.680 --> 28:46.000
But they put the ooze just in enough to where the light flips.

28:46.000 --> 28:46.800
Turns green.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.720
Green light lit on this radio.

28:49.840 --> 28:57.440
A bright flash lights up and you see shadows of each of you in the endless horizon.

28:57.440 --> 29:04.560
And because there's nothing to stop the light really for an almost indeterminate amount

29:04.560 --> 29:11.280
of space away from you, your shadows all light up and look enormous.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.160
Surrounding this place.

29:14.160 --> 29:14.720
That's cool.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.640
And in the darkness.

29:20.160 --> 29:20.660
Fellas.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.520
Oh my God, it's me.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.960
It's me and I'm inside me.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.960
The younger of the Clarks goes running up to him and grabbing him by the shoulders.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.400
And he's smiling big.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.280
Drew, Drew.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.320
Bubblegum tree.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.520
Bubblegum tree.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.240
But we did it.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.520
It gives you a huge hug.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.160
We did it.

29:38.800 --> 29:43.360
Muck John descends down in front of him and tips his cowboy hat and says, welcome back.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.080
John, John, you're, you're amazing.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.760
I know, bud.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.480
Look at you.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.120
Oh, look at all of you.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.800
Oh, you did so good.

29:56.160 --> 29:56.960
Oh my God.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.920
And then he starts transforming before your eyes.

29:59.920 --> 30:05.120
And his tentacles come out of his head.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.240
Drew Thulu.

30:08.160 --> 30:16.560
A million keys come out and just suffocate.

30:20.320 --> 30:20.880
Thank you.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.160
Thank you so much.

30:22.160 --> 30:29.280
Officer Bishop, you have, and she's crying and you hear through this darkness, these

30:29.280 --> 30:30.160
licks, these.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.920
Oh, Oh Tyler.

30:35.920 --> 30:36.560
Oh Tyler.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.440
You're so good.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.240
Oh my goodness.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.600
I put a hand on her shoulder.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.080
I told you I'd find him.

30:42.080 --> 30:42.880
Oh, thank you.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.520
You've saved my contention.

30:48.400 --> 30:48.720
Okay.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.280
So if we're here, are we here forever?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.240
Do we set up?

30:52.240 --> 30:53.680
What's first a post office?

30:56.720 --> 30:58.000
Overseer starts walking over.

30:58.640 --> 31:04.240
Well, I, I guess, I guess it's up to us at this point, what happens now.

31:04.240 --> 31:11.200
But, uh, I think with the help of Mir, Mir, Miria, Keith here, Keith, Keith Reed,

31:11.200 --> 31:16.720
Keith, Keith is like sitting cross-legged on the ground, like rubbing his temples.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.480
Like looks like he's in pain.

31:18.480 --> 31:23.200
I think with, uh, with his help here, I think, I think I can, I can handle some, some rebuilding

31:23.200 --> 31:26.560
and I think he can probably navigate better than I can.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.440
I think we can set things right at this point.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.600
Because Keith beans is, is now a Heinz mind.

31:35.040 --> 31:35.540
Yeah.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.260
Yeah.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.280
Close enough.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.080
Close enough, Drew.

31:38.800 --> 31:44.640
Or maybe he's, when there's a bunch of them, he's the creatures of the black legume.

31:44.640 --> 31:45.840
No, that was actually great.

31:45.840 --> 31:46.880
Because of the beans.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.160
That's a good, that's a really good one.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.200
You like that one?

31:49.200 --> 31:49.840
That's really good.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.040
Those are the only two I have.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.240
God, it's good to see you again.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.600
And Overseer gives him a hug.

31:55.280 --> 32:01.520
Oh, and Drew is just like, oh man, in this like triangle hug between the two Clark Bishops.

32:04.240 --> 32:08.880
His face is just poking through and between their shoulders and looking up to this muck

32:08.880 --> 32:09.520
John.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.240
Who slips a tentacle of who's in there and like pats his back.

32:13.360 --> 32:16.240
You know, you, uh, you didn't do what I told you to do.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.520
You ended up going to Maggie's and he looks angry for a second.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.240
Yeah.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.440
And then he smiles.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.120
It brought us here though, I guess.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.760
Uh, I'm sorry.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.840
All's well that ends well.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.800
I was really scared.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.320
I've been scared for so long.

32:37.200 --> 32:37.760
Five days.

32:38.960 --> 32:42.240
It's a long time when you're trapped inside a council woman.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.520
A lot of responsibility.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.480
Oh my goodness.

32:44.480 --> 32:45.280
The meetings.

32:47.120 --> 32:53.600
As, as everybody's talking, Keith is like starting to turn pale and like sweating.

32:53.600 --> 32:59.520
And the whole area is starting to kind of rumble a little bit.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.600
Keith, you, uh, you okay over there?

33:01.600 --> 33:02.640
We got to get out of here.

33:03.520 --> 33:03.840
Why?

33:03.840 --> 33:04.080
Why?

33:05.120 --> 33:06.160
This can be our home.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.520
This, I mean, it's not much to look at.

33:09.520 --> 33:16.880
I can hear so many things from everywhere and I think we just need to get back.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.280
I just don't want to hear all of this anymore.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.240
It's your old Keith almighty situation.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.000
I hope it's Bruce and not Evan.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.400
I mean, yeah, I guess you, you're kind of are the sequel to myriad though.

33:30.400 --> 33:34.880
So you might be Evan.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.800
I myself, John Lee Pennymore.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.440
I liked them.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.440
Keith's eyes open up wide and he's like, we have to get out of here.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.160
I will not be Evan almighty.

33:48.080 --> 33:51.920
All right, well let's Steve corral everyone up and then let's get out of here.

33:52.480 --> 33:52.800
Wow.

33:54.000 --> 33:54.800
You're really laying them down.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.320
You're positively giddy to be back in your body.

33:58.320 --> 34:02.000
Boys, boys, boys, boys, what do we want to do?

34:03.840 --> 34:04.800
Where do we want to go?

34:06.400 --> 34:07.360
We can do anything.

34:08.400 --> 34:12.720
We being me, but also we being us.

34:12.720 --> 34:19.280
Overseer saying, well, yeah, uh, we, we, we can, we can do, we can do whatever, whatever

34:19.280 --> 34:20.720
we, we want.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.880
And he turns to younger Clark.

34:23.920 --> 34:32.720
I'm, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure that you can, I think, uh, I think you need to do the things

34:32.720 --> 34:36.560
that I did because that's how I ended up here.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.600
Somebody, somebody has to be the overseer when this all happens.

34:41.360 --> 34:45.680
When it happened, it's, it's the short end of the stick.

34:46.160 --> 34:52.000
It's, uh, it's not, uh, it's not ideal, but, uh, as he's saying all this to Clark, there's

34:52.000 --> 34:55.520
not a single thing in his face that gives away anything.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.840
He is smiling broad and big.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.800
And he goes, yeah, dude, no, of course.

35:00.800 --> 35:05.200
Uh, that's, uh, I had already thought about that and I'm, I'm looking forward to it.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.680
I, I, I, I'm the, I, I win.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.720
I'm the, I'm the savior.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.240
I'm the, I'm the guy who does everything.

35:10.240 --> 35:16.400
I, it's, I become you and then you work with me in the future and cool.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.520
Send me where you need me to.

35:17.520 --> 35:18.720
Just, just shoot me away.

35:18.720 --> 35:19.120
I'm good.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.720
I'm I've got plans.

35:20.720 --> 35:23.840
I know I need to run and to tell Drew something sometime.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.720
I'll, I'll write them down.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.760
I'll write down all the notes.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.240
I got it.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.440
I got it.

35:27.440 --> 35:28.240
Just shoot me on.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.480
I'm ready to go.

35:30.480 --> 35:36.160
As soon as he says that, a, a Keith pops up behind him with like this, uh, kind of almost

35:36.160 --> 35:41.760
like golden robe with a very long hood and just, you know, the one you've been seeing

35:41.760 --> 35:46.080
the overseer wear this whole time and places it over.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.400
Clark said, well, that's, that's an upgrade.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.400
It looks good on you though.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.240
The Keith pops out of existence.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.120
Clark, that just, uh, just take it easy out there.

35:57.120 --> 36:04.160
It's a, it's a long, long, long road, but I got you set up over in that tower over there.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.920
You should be, you should be, have all the things you need there.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.200
That's kind of your home base.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.240
That's where I set up.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.400
It's a, it's up to you now.

36:11.040 --> 36:11.360
Cool.

36:11.360 --> 36:11.680
Right on.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.960
I'll, I'll, uh, you guys, uh, Hey, it was great working with you guys.

36:15.920 --> 36:19.360
Uh, I'm glad, I'm, I'm glad it ended up the way it did.

36:19.360 --> 36:24.480
Uh, Keith, uh, congratulations on your new found powers and John.

36:24.480 --> 36:28.240
And it's been the ride of a lifetime or several.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.560
Is this it Clark?

36:30.560 --> 36:31.280
That's it.

36:31.280 --> 36:31.840
Yeah.

36:31.840 --> 36:32.720
Afraid so.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.080
I mean, I'll see you guys a lot coming up.

36:36.080 --> 36:40.800
Uh, there's a lot of, a lot of looping and resetting and I, I kind of, I kind of twiddle

36:40.800 --> 36:41.440
my fingers in there.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.280
You guys remember, but I guess you won't know that it's me then.

36:45.840 --> 36:46.800
It's it's all right.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.880
I'm, I'm sure I'll get used to it.

36:48.880 --> 36:56.320
Keith stands up and feeling pretty emotional thinking that he might not see Clark for maybe

36:56.320 --> 37:01.840
not ever again, but maybe not for a little while and kind of loses control of his emotions

37:01.840 --> 37:08.480
and hundreds of thousands of Keith's appear behind him and they all, you know, our little

37:08.480 --> 37:13.600
tear running down their face and Keith reaches his hand out to Clark.

37:13.600 --> 37:17.120
Clark slaps it away and brings him in for a big old Clark bear hug.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.800
And Keith just hugs him as tight as he can.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.680
Two or three other Keith's come in and hug him too.

37:23.680 --> 37:24.640
It's a dog pile.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.640
John, John, get on in here.

37:32.240 --> 37:39.120
Like iridescent tears are streaming down his face and, um, he, he makes himself look a

37:39.120 --> 37:40.160
little more like John.

37:40.160 --> 37:46.720
It's less the goo, the goo world, John, and he kind of manifests the John you knew on

37:46.720 --> 37:50.800
the first day of all this, at least, you know, in the bust.

37:50.800 --> 37:51.520
Right.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.280
But it's still mostly a goo body.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.960
But it looks like John Lee Pettymore the third.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.680
Oh, it's, uh, it's good to see.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.960
I haven't seen that face in a while.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.280
That's a, that's a good, that's a good.

38:03.280 --> 38:03.520
Yeah.

38:03.520 --> 38:04.400
Well, shut up, baby.

38:04.400 --> 38:04.720
I know.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.840
A fifth, a fifth Keith comes in behind John and pushes him into the group hug.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.800
John breaks down.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.600
He hugs back, but he's just like heaving.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.000
You can't hear him crying, but he's just convulsing.

38:20.000 --> 38:20.320
Yeah.

38:20.320 --> 38:26.800
Uh, the extra Keith's fade away and it's just the three, the three of us group hugging.

38:26.800 --> 38:33.200
And then Keith steps back and, well, if you're gonna, if you're gonna stay here, John, what

38:33.200 --> 38:33.840
are you gonna do?

38:34.400 --> 38:35.440
I'm of this world.

38:36.880 --> 38:41.600
I think I might try to go back through one of those doors and see where the next ones

38:41.600 --> 38:41.840
lead.

38:42.400 --> 38:47.200
Will we, uh, will we see you again?

38:48.720 --> 38:50.640
Keith, you're, you're God.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.520
You'll see all of us whenever you want.

38:54.240 --> 38:59.040
Well, I know what I'm going to do and I'm going to stay where I go.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.680
I don't plan on visiting other worlds or other planes.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.920
Is there, is there anything I can do for you guys before I go?

39:11.520 --> 39:12.800
Is there anything you want?

39:12.800 --> 39:14.640
Uh, the overseer steps up.

39:14.640 --> 39:20.080
Well, um, if you're, uh, if you're offering, I feel like my job's kind of done.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.880
I think I might be in for a reward of some sort.

39:23.520 --> 39:28.080
Is that, can I ask you to, you kind of control reality now, right?

39:28.080 --> 39:33.360
As far as I understand it in the past 45 seconds to two minutes.

39:33.360 --> 39:33.600
Yeah.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.880
I think, I think you can, uh, you can, can you, can you slot me in somewhere where I'm

39:38.880 --> 39:43.680
a, I'm like a, like a detective from like those books or movies.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.720
I want to be a noir style detective somewhere.

39:47.280 --> 39:54.000
I don't know if this sounds, uh, I don't know if this sounds up your alley, but, uh, I've

39:54.000 --> 39:54.800
got an idea.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.640
Do you trust me?

39:58.160 --> 39:58.640
Sure.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.000
Of course we did.

40:00.000 --> 40:00.960
We did it together.

40:00.960 --> 40:01.520
Yeah.

40:01.520 --> 40:05.360
Come with me and, uh, we'll be happy.

40:06.320 --> 40:06.640
All right.

40:06.640 --> 40:12.720
And Keith reaches out his hand to the overseer and three up and down handshake.

40:12.720 --> 40:17.280
And then he motions them to like, just like stand right beside it.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.880
Wait real fast before we go.

40:18.880 --> 40:23.120
And, uh, the overseer is going to do a, uh, something he's going to do a spell or something

40:23.120 --> 40:24.720
to send the liturgy.

40:24.720 --> 40:29.600
Uh, he wants to drop them doing their chance and send them back to where they are from.

40:30.240 --> 40:30.560
Okay.

40:30.560 --> 40:40.480
So as soon as the liturgy breaks and the chanting whispers have dissipated.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.480
Thanks for all your help, everyone.

40:42.960 --> 40:43.600
Good show.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.800
Clark Bishop.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.600
Oh my God.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.040
Oh my God.

40:47.040 --> 40:50.800
Gary Daley falls to his knees and just begins weeping.

40:50.800 --> 40:51.520
Endlessly.

40:55.280 --> 40:55.840
Harry.

41:03.200 --> 41:07.280
A Keith pops up behind him and starts like just kind of rubbing his shoulders a little

41:07.280 --> 41:07.840
bit.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.960
I can't go on.

41:08.960 --> 41:09.920
I can't do it.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.200
Gary.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.880
I'm, I'm, I'm terribly sorry that we can, we can save Henry.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.720
That's a Harry.

41:16.720 --> 41:17.440
Oh fuck.

41:19.200 --> 41:26.160
And he grabs, he grabs, uh, he grabs onto your uniform, the shoulders on both sides

41:26.160 --> 41:33.280
and gets real fistfuls of cloth, you know, on either side and just buries his face into

41:33.280 --> 41:34.000
your chest.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.880
It was like that old turkey.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.240
Next name was Harry.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.000
I'm, I'm sorry.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.800
It's been, it's been a century since I've seen him.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.680
I'm sorry about that.

41:45.120 --> 41:48.240
He's mine and I can't do it without him.

41:48.240 --> 41:52.320
And he, uh, he looks up into your eyes with just plea.

41:53.120 --> 41:56.560
If you're going to take me somewhere, can you take me where he's there?

41:56.560 --> 41:57.600
Yeah, yeah.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.280
We, uh, I look over at Keith.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.360
Yeah, we can, we can, we can do that.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.920
That's, that's something I can do and he can do it together.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.600
We can make sure that for sure happens.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.560
He's easy.

42:07.360 --> 42:11.280
If I go there and he's there, would I also be there?

42:12.880 --> 42:14.720
And Keith puts his hand on his shoulder.

42:15.840 --> 42:21.280
Hey, look, Keith reaches out with his hand and in his hand is a little tiny figurine

42:21.280 --> 42:26.480
of Harry with a big bowl of pho in his hands.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.040
We're all going to a good place.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.520
As soon as we get done here, we're going to a good place.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.200
Overseer turns to the crowd.

42:33.680 --> 42:39.200
As a matter of fact, if anybody, if any, if anybody wants to go anywhere, that's, we can

42:39.200 --> 42:40.960
just do that, right?

42:40.960 --> 42:41.600
Isn't that right?

42:41.600 --> 42:45.120
I think we can, I think we can just send you back to a better place.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.560
Keith roll unarmed combat.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.560
Oh, what?

42:52.960 --> 42:53.520
64.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.680
Pretty sure that's a fail.

42:58.640 --> 42:59.120
Yeah.

42:59.120 --> 43:07.440
Mildred Mitchell catches you with a sneak attack from behind puts her tiny frail old

43:07.440 --> 43:13.520
lady arms around your neck from the back and she's trying to choke you out.

43:13.520 --> 43:25.920
10 Keith's pop out and gently remove her.

43:30.160 --> 43:40.160
And then until the bee pops up in front of her and they just run to each other and embrace

43:40.160 --> 43:43.200
in this dim, dim light of this world.

43:43.200 --> 43:47.360
And the till they be like looks around at all the other case and does a shrug.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.040
Wait, so it's just, it's just key.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.320
It's just fucking key.

43:56.320 --> 43:56.820
Yeah.

44:01.200 --> 44:01.520
Okay.

44:01.520 --> 44:09.280
So Mildred starts hugging her and is like, are you, are you okay?

44:09.280 --> 44:13.600
Um, I'm super okay.

44:15.360 --> 44:18.880
Grandma role persuade weirdo.

44:22.080 --> 44:36.560
That's a success or the 57 on a 60 and Mildred is so happy and relieved to finally be reunited

44:37.040 --> 44:39.440
with her granddaughter till DB Mitchell.

44:39.440 --> 44:40.560
Keith looks at him.

44:40.560 --> 44:45.040
Hey, you guys have got a place in, uh, at my place.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.160
Same as the overseer.

44:46.160 --> 44:51.440
Same as anybody else here that doesn't want to go back to their, their plane.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.320
I'm going to let that persuade roll over.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.840
Yes, we can be together.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.680
We can be a family again.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.640
Jack Pearlman.

45:07.200 --> 45:07.700
Jack.

45:12.080 --> 45:15.120
Jack Pearlman, Everett pace.

45:15.920 --> 45:23.120
Look at each other and also see Greer Hilfintop Kermunker now and a bartender and a piano

45:23.120 --> 45:25.120
player and a gambler named Thomas.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.240
They're all from the same time period and contention.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.680
They all recognize each other.

45:30.720 --> 45:34.560
You're saying I can go anywhere that I want.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.280
Don't have to be back where I came from.

45:37.280 --> 45:39.200
Yeah, I think that's what we're saying.

45:39.200 --> 45:42.240
I think, I think we can get you, get you set up any way you want.

45:42.880 --> 45:49.680
I used to have a ranch with the, with all these horses and I just love, love just a

45:49.680 --> 45:54.960
big old ranch with a big old herd of horses that need tendon to that I can take care of

45:54.960 --> 46:01.440
surrounded by beautiful nature, lakes, a seller full of good whiskey, couple of dogs to keep

46:01.440 --> 46:04.640
me company, a room devoted to all kinds of good books.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.040
I think that's a life I could love.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.400
Keith speaks up.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.000
What was your name again?

46:10.640 --> 46:11.760
Jack Pearlman.

46:11.760 --> 46:12.260
Jack.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.360
Jack, if you come with me, I can give you, I can give you everything you want.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.520
Everett comes toddling up.

46:19.520 --> 46:24.320
Hey, uh, Jack, uh, that sounds pretty nice.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.080
You think maybe I could have a, have a little shack out there on the edge of your property?

46:28.080 --> 46:29.840
I think that'd do just fine Everett.

46:29.840 --> 46:33.600
Hey Everett, have you ever wanted more than a shack?

46:33.600 --> 46:34.400
Oh, hell no.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.600
I just want my shack.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.560
Duly nobody.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.560
It's what I contend to is what I like.

46:41.120 --> 46:48.160
Oh yes, and I would very much like, uh, some sort of building where I could do my workouts

46:48.160 --> 46:51.040
and squash the watermelons with my thighs.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.080
Come with me.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.200
My name is Greer.

46:54.240 --> 46:57.120
I don't, I didn't ask what your name was, but, uh.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.240
Yeah, he just promised you watermelons, man.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.440
He didn't ask the fuck you were.

47:01.440 --> 47:06.800
Hint up your monger now, and I will, if you are willing to, to furnish watermelons for

47:06.800 --> 47:07.300
me.

47:08.240 --> 47:12.480
As I said, Jack over here, if you come with me, I can give you whatever you want.

47:12.480 --> 47:13.200
Okay.

47:13.200 --> 47:18.080
Everett turns around to the Thomas the gambler and the bartender and piano player.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.200
You guys are welcome to come with us.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.800
You're, you're, you're, you're part of our career as far as I'm concerned.

47:24.880 --> 47:30.160
Oh yeah, I sure, I sure would like to come with y'all if we could get some sort of tavern

47:30.160 --> 47:30.560
set up.

47:30.560 --> 47:31.520
Sir, what's your name?

47:31.520 --> 47:33.200
Oh, my name's Sparkin.

47:33.200 --> 47:33.920
Sparkin?

47:35.360 --> 47:36.000
What do you want?

47:36.880 --> 47:37.920
Oh, you know me?

47:37.920 --> 47:41.440
I just love having a, having a bar to slide glass down, you know?

47:45.600 --> 47:48.960
If you come with me, you can slide glass all day and all night.

47:48.960 --> 47:50.160
Oh, I like the sound of that.

47:50.160 --> 47:54.720
And he slaps the piano player on the back and is like, Hey, does that mean that I, that

47:55.680 --> 47:58.480
it'll be a piano there for me to tickle the fun, tickle the, tickle the operates?

48:00.880 --> 48:07.200
Keith has a, another Keith pop up in front of him and like get down on all fours and

48:07.200 --> 48:08.800
Keith steps up on his back.

48:10.240 --> 48:14.480
Anybody here that wants to come with me, you'll have a place.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.800
Anything you want, I can give to you.

48:18.800 --> 48:22.080
If you come with me, gesture over to Clark.

48:22.800 --> 48:26.000
So, uh, make your decision.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.520
I guess I won't be mad.

48:27.520 --> 48:28.400
He won't be mad.

48:29.040 --> 48:35.600
This is that scene in every dog movie where the bad guy and the main characters stand

48:35.600 --> 48:38.560
on opposite sides and like call the dog for them.

48:38.560 --> 48:39.060
Yeah.

48:39.600 --> 48:46.400
And in this case, we've got a raccoon, a chunk kitty, a distinguished gray dog and old chunky

48:46.400 --> 48:47.600
proud chipmunk.

48:48.400 --> 48:54.880
We've got Tyler, the excitable black lab, a friendly woodpecker, an old gray squirrel,

48:54.880 --> 48:56.080
a golden retriever.

48:56.080 --> 48:57.600
Bean is there as well.

48:58.160 --> 49:05.840
Salem, the cat's body has been mewing constantly at the radio, just pawing at the radio and

49:05.840 --> 49:09.600
mewing over and over Archie and taco joined the group as well.

49:09.600 --> 49:16.080
And that whole mess of fun time, content your contention, create a career coalition

49:17.200 --> 49:21.840
animals all swarm toward Keith Clark.

49:21.840 --> 49:29.120
I stepped down from the Keith that's bent over and motion you toward to like step up

49:29.120 --> 49:29.920
on there.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.360
Please call me, call me overseer.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.000
I'm no, I'm no longer Clark.

49:34.880 --> 49:35.380
Over.

49:39.040 --> 49:47.520
Keith, uh, rolls his eyes a little bit, but he's like, uh, well, I've, I've said my piece,

49:47.520 --> 49:50.240
uh, overseer say what you must.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.600
I'm going to need your help here, Keith.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.100
Yeah.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.680
Everybody ready?

49:55.680 --> 49:59.280
We're going to send you Clara Blankenship and Casey Kristoff.

49:59.360 --> 50:01.280
The only two that I haven't mentioned yet.

50:01.280 --> 50:07.840
Also go and join the group that is standing over by the Keith's who's in a Clark slash

50:07.840 --> 50:09.600
overseers group.

50:09.600 --> 50:13.040
I don't, I don't picture us dividing like that.

50:13.040 --> 50:13.600
Do you?

50:13.600 --> 50:18.960
Uh, no, but that's, what's funny is that Keith is seeing as, as a competition and everyone

50:18.960 --> 50:22.560
goes to Keith side and he just looks at you at this smug face.

50:23.280 --> 50:23.780
Okay.

50:24.560 --> 50:25.760
Yeah, they're all this fucking eyes.

50:26.240 --> 50:30.720
I guess they all, I guess they went with God.

50:32.160 --> 50:35.040
Your wife kissed me on the cheek earlier tonight.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.400
Wait, what is that from?

50:36.400 --> 50:38.800
I think you should leave and look at you now.

50:39.840 --> 50:42.400
Everyone's coming to party in my house.

50:46.880 --> 50:50.240
I will say, uh, I was not picturing it like that at all.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.520
I was thinking like, if you want to go back to your old life, go with him.

50:54.160 --> 50:59.040
If you want to follow a, uh, have you heard of Jesus, a Jesus like character?

50:59.040 --> 50:59.600
Come with me.

51:03.440 --> 51:07.360
Overseer has been in concert with you because I think that the deal is that the overseer

51:07.360 --> 51:10.640
is going to be able to help like create portals, but you're the one who's going to be able

51:10.640 --> 51:12.080
to create realities.

51:12.080 --> 51:12.580
Yeah.

51:13.280 --> 51:16.160
The Clark is staying here to wait his time in the tower.

51:16.160 --> 51:16.960
What's Don doing?

51:16.960 --> 51:17.920
What's John doing?

51:17.920 --> 51:22.640
He's rolling off almost into the sunset on planet juggernaut, but he looks down at

51:22.640 --> 51:28.160
Don as he passes and he says, uncle Don, you've been in this world a lot longer than

51:28.160 --> 51:32.400
me and I plan on bringing some law to it.

51:33.280 --> 51:37.360
You want to ride the juggernaut across these cosmic planes with me?

51:37.360 --> 51:41.680
Don like formally crumpled over hugging the thing.

51:41.680 --> 51:47.440
Did not know that you were John because he thought the John he was with was the John.

51:48.240 --> 51:50.240
Oh, Hey, there were three of us, bud.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.000
Hearing the voice because he's heard it so many times come from the spheres.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.400
Now he's like, you're a hell yeah boy.

51:58.400 --> 51:58.880
Hell yeah.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.200
And he's like, starts like getting super pumped.

52:01.200 --> 52:07.360
He puts the wand into his pants pocket and like runs up to the planet juggernaut and

52:07.360 --> 52:10.000
he's like, let's bring some law to this lawless land.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.520
Yeah, fuck yeah.

52:11.520 --> 52:20.000
And whose arm shoots down from like high atop planet juggernaut and your nephew, your

52:20.000 --> 52:26.640
whose nephew like flings you up on top next to him and together you top planet juggernaut

52:27.520 --> 52:28.640
into the sunset.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.140
Yes.

52:30.720 --> 52:33.520
Oh, I want to read that comic.

52:33.520 --> 52:42.320
Oh my God, brother Nick Nichols is that planet juggernaut about to head the fuck out of here

52:42.320 --> 52:43.920
out into the sunset forever?

52:43.920 --> 52:49.280
My brother, it does appear he's heading off into a sort of sunset if I had to put a word

52:49.280 --> 52:49.760
to it.

52:49.760 --> 52:50.400
Oh my God.

52:50.400 --> 52:55.120
Well, before he quite leaves, let's go ahead and get our question in.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.320
They keep calling him Keith.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.000
What do you think about this fellow so far?

52:58.000 --> 53:01.280
Now, is this the Keith that we like or is this another Keith?

53:01.280 --> 53:06.160
I would say that we definitely like this one because he seems to be granting people's

53:06.160 --> 53:08.640
wishes and my wish to this Keith.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.840
Are you listening Keith?

53:09.840 --> 53:10.800
Hundreds of voices.

53:14.640 --> 53:22.160
I don't know about you Nick, but for me personally, I would love for Richard Dick Nichols to join

53:22.160 --> 53:26.880
us here of this very last treasurable time in our lives.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.480
What do you think about getting them here?

53:28.560 --> 53:30.880
The wildest versions of them that are-

53:30.880 --> 53:36.640
I'd love to get all of the family back together.

53:37.520 --> 53:43.600
As you're talking and looking at each other, you can see on either of your necks, something

53:43.600 --> 53:47.200
start to like kind of start poking out.

53:47.200 --> 53:49.120
Oh my goodness.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.720
Oh, heavens.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.160
Oh, Dick Nichols.

53:52.160 --> 53:52.880
Is that you?

53:53.680 --> 53:55.280
I believe it is, brother.

53:55.280 --> 53:58.240
Haven't seen you in forever, my dear.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.960
Oh, clasp hands with me, brother.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.560
Oh, yes.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.880
And our hands are tiny little hands that are what?

54:04.880 --> 54:05.840
Poking out of skin?

54:05.840 --> 54:11.440
No, your heads just grow like on your neck and shoulder.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.200
So you're like two-headed.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.040
Should we nuzzle our-

54:15.040 --> 54:15.540
Yes.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.240
Oh, nuzzle with me, brother.

54:18.240 --> 54:20.800
Yes, our nipples will touch forever.

54:21.760 --> 54:27.840
You know, when I first heard those characters, I thought they were just, you know, like British

54:28.640 --> 54:31.920
or something, you know, like all the classic movie villains.

54:31.920 --> 54:35.920
But then I realized they were actually queer coded, like all the classic movie villains.

54:36.480 --> 54:40.640
So aren't you the classic movie villains, Zack and Justin?

54:40.640 --> 54:43.920
I would say that we're the heroes of this story, my dear.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.160
Oh, everyone thinks different.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.080
They don't know what they're talking about.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.720
Oh, this simpleton talking to us.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.080
Oh, my goodness.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.600
He knows none of what he speaks.

54:54.160 --> 54:58.000
Well, I personally think it's really nice to have the nickel nickels.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.600
There's all the four nickels, quad nickels, all together here, coming up right now.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.760
We're all walking up here, all playing and jogging on.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.120
Oh, my goodness.

55:07.120 --> 55:07.920
Oh, look at him.

55:07.920 --> 55:08.960
He's round.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.400
He's round, brother.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.640
He's a round bound of something, I tell you.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.320
I want to work.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.120
Wait, what do you want to do?

55:18.080 --> 55:22.160
Well, what are we going to do now?

55:22.160 --> 55:24.800
Should we ask him if we could come with him?

55:24.800 --> 55:25.440
Hold on.

55:25.440 --> 55:28.960
He holds both his microphones out and walks directly towards them.

55:29.600 --> 55:30.560
Nick walks out.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.200
Ting, ting, ting.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.800
Mr. Juggernaut.

55:34.800 --> 55:37.280
So Goo John feels like a tug at his shoulder.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.400
And it's this little tendril from Planet Juggernaut.

55:41.040 --> 55:45.520
And they stopped their dramatic mosey into the sunset.

55:46.480 --> 55:47.680
And John looks down.

55:47.760 --> 55:49.840
And he sees the nickels far below him.

55:50.720 --> 55:54.880
And there's this little Planet Juggernaut tendril right next to him in the shape of

55:54.880 --> 55:58.960
a hand with its finger out, given the just a minute hand gesture.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.600
What do you need, boys?

56:02.320 --> 56:02.960
Ask him, Nick.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.520
I don't know if I can, Nick.

56:05.520 --> 56:06.320
Oh, come on.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.760
I bet you can do it.

56:07.760 --> 56:09.920
Oh, we believe you must do it.

56:11.280 --> 56:11.780
Okay.

56:13.040 --> 56:14.160
Do you think we could...

56:14.160 --> 56:17.280
I'm holding both the microphones up, and I'm pressing them against him.

56:18.640 --> 56:22.640
Can we follow you and, like, you do stuff and we say stuff in the microphone?

56:22.640 --> 56:23.840
Ellie, talk about it.

56:25.040 --> 56:27.520
Follow me, boys.

56:28.160 --> 56:31.680
And then a little, like, vacuum hose comes out.

56:32.560 --> 56:36.160
And the microphones are ripped out of your hands.

56:36.160 --> 56:39.520
And almost the skin is nearly ripped off your hands.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.480
And then you are sucked into Planet Juggernaut.

56:47.840 --> 56:50.480
Okay, Jon, we can go.

56:50.480 --> 56:56.800
But before you really can go, this whole time, Drew Andrews has been making his way

56:57.440 --> 57:03.440
assertively out toward Planet Juggernaut and Jon to say one final farewell.

57:04.080 --> 57:04.800
Jon sees it.

57:04.800 --> 57:05.840
He doesn't need...

57:05.840 --> 57:08.800
He sees Drew strutting out towards him.

57:08.800 --> 57:09.600
Oh, nay.

57:11.280 --> 57:11.680
Whoa.

57:18.400 --> 57:19.440
Horse things.

57:20.320 --> 57:22.000
Hold on, Planet Juggernaut.

57:22.560 --> 57:27.040
Do you have any cool BDSM stuff on Planet Juggernaut to, like, hold on?

57:28.000 --> 57:28.800
Like horses have?

57:29.920 --> 57:33.040
Horses do have cool BDSM stuff on, don't they?

57:33.040 --> 57:34.560
I never thought of it that way.

57:34.560 --> 57:35.360
Horses are rad.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.520
Horses are freaks, yeah.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.380
No.

57:44.400 --> 57:45.360
Asked and answered.

57:46.240 --> 57:46.740
I know.

57:47.280 --> 57:48.160
So there is, like...

57:48.880 --> 57:50.800
It doesn't look like it's even attached.

57:50.800 --> 57:57.200
It's the right size, but it looks so comically small on the top of Planet Juggernaut.

57:57.200 --> 58:03.280
But you just have a perfect just, like, cowboy saddle made out of the shifting, starry,

58:03.280 --> 58:08.000
ethereal, incandescent, iridescent star, like, muck.

58:08.000 --> 58:08.560
Beautiful.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.640
It is beautiful.

58:10.640 --> 58:11.760
From inside you here.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.720
Well, that was wonderful.

58:14.720 --> 58:18.720
So, yeah, he pulls on some, like, imaginary reins.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.640
He's sitting on the saddle, but there are no reins.

58:20.640 --> 58:23.840
He and Planet Juggernaut are pretty much as one.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.040
They're both ball.

58:25.040 --> 58:27.200
You can't see the tendril going from...

58:28.160 --> 58:28.880
Oh, God.

58:29.920 --> 58:30.800
Butthole to butthole.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.440
Like a merry-go-round horse.

58:36.320 --> 58:37.280
But you're the horse.

58:38.320 --> 58:38.820
Um...

58:39.360 --> 58:40.080
Do you like that?

58:40.080 --> 58:40.320
Nope.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.240
No, I was thinking more like some kind of...

58:45.120 --> 58:47.920
So Drew Andrews joins you on the plane.

58:51.760 --> 58:56.080
John, I just wanted to say thank you before you go.

58:56.960 --> 58:57.680
For what, Drew?

58:58.560 --> 59:00.960
Thank you for always being there for us.

59:01.680 --> 59:02.720
You taught me a lot.

59:02.720 --> 59:08.560
You taught me how to shoot a gun and how to be a man.

59:09.440 --> 59:13.200
And also, some of those lessons were, like,

59:13.840 --> 59:17.360
those kinds of lessons where you learn from one another not to do stuff.

59:17.360 --> 59:20.240
But I think that you're, like, a really...

59:20.240 --> 59:22.320
I think you are always trying your best.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.280
And I really...

59:23.280 --> 59:24.240
I think that's cool.

59:24.800 --> 59:26.560
Hey, I think you're pretty cool too, man.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.880
Just remember what I taught you, though.

59:33.120 --> 59:34.880
You remember where the clitoris is, right?

59:39.280 --> 59:39.920
Adios.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.640
Jesus Christ.

59:46.640 --> 59:49.120
A beautiful moment and pretending to be me.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.160
Unless, Drew, would you want to come with me?

59:58.160 --> 01:00:04.000
Yeah, I think that I have more to learn because I didn't know when you just said that.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:05.920
I don't know.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.360
You're gonna have to tell me again as we go.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.440
And Agent Trent Catt, the beautiful black cat that was once called Salem,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.880
but now is embodied by the spirit of Agent Trent Chad,

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:29.600
is running around the ankles and rubbing against the ankles of Drew Andrews.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:34.800
And so Drew picks up this black cat and throws the cat up on his shoulders.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.960
And the cat kind of wraps himself around Drew's shoulders.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.720
And he's like, what do you say, Agent Trent Catt?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.640
No, he can't come.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.120
Oh, okay.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:45.920
I'm kidding.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.560
Oh, okay.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.440
Oh, every time with this guy.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.160
Yeah, I mean, like, my brothers used to do stuff like that a lot to me.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.560
And I just can't, like, you know, they go out for a cheers with a beer bottle

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.840
and they whack the top of real hearts so it flows out the top, you know.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.320
What?

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.440
It makes you go out the top?

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.160
Well, that's yeah.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.160


01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.040
Will you do that to me soon?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:10.880
Okay.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.400
It's sad.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.560
It's sad how we write.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:17.920
Hold on.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.760
I think that was perfect.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.920
All right, great.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.480
Moving on.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.680
That's a series wrap on Drew Andrews, everybody.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.360
Oh, yeah.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.760
Wow, really good job, Drew.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.480
As Planet Juggernaut and friends write off...

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.360
Get as far away from Jesus, Keith, as they can.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.440
Some may ride with that boy.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.400
Yeah, I don't trust this messianic message of his.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.880
As they write off into the mostly pure darkness,

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.360
Keith pops the sun up so that they can ride into the sunset.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.200
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:06.240
And as they do, Keith takes special note of Planet Juggernaut's shape.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:07.760
I like it.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:08.800
Ominous.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.080
Well, Clark, I think we're about to get out of here.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.960
Are you gonna be okay?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.840
Is there anything you need or want from me?

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.560
He's had a grin on this entire time.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.000
This is his own personal wish fulfillment.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.960
He's serving this purpose that he's always wanted to.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.440
I'm good, guys.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.400
I thank you all for your help and I'm gonna thank you 10 times over

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.640
because I know how this all ends now, but it's good to know at least.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.560
I'm happy.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.280
I'm good.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.640
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.240
And then Keith puts his hand on Clark's shoulder and there's like a sudden,

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.560
almost like a sound wave or something.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.920
Something kind of pushes coming from the tower that you're going to be residing in.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:07.680
And Clark won't know it, but every single cabinet drawer filled with microwave dinners.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:12.640
Yes.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.440
But no microwave.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.760
Or freezer.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.120
So they melt immediately.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.760
It's a horror game.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.840
Hell in the rotten tower.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:42.240
Keith takes his hand off Clark and gives him, you know, one of those kind of last looks

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.680
where we both know, like, it might be a while.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.720
Solid nod shared.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.040
Keith is content knowing Clark's going to find a way to heat these microwave dinners up.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.800
Hey, Clark, if you ever need anything from me, like,

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.520
you ever get hungry and need to eat in 30 seconds, let me know.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.320
Clark, if you ever need anything from me, just think it.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.040
I'll feel it.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.400
You, you, you, you gotta, but I mean, I'm going to need a lot from you eventually,

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.080
but it's in the past and you've already done it.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.120
So it's all, we're all good.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.920
Thank you.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.960
Keith gives that one last look to Clark and he kind of turns around and looks at the

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.160
so many last looks.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.600
Well, I mean, you know, it's a big moment.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.120
It is a, it is a big moment.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.400
It's a big moment, Keith.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.440
I mean, on the horizon, uh, John, Don and Planet Juggernaut take a last look back at

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.000
you guys.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.840
And John raises his ooze hat.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.760
And then Keith Keith's returns to his congregation.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.240
Y'all ready?

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:06.240
And then they blip out of this existence and they blip into contention, which at this

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:12.320
point has been just completely destroyed by, can you Zach, can you give us a quick rundown

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:15.280
of why and how contention has been destroyed?

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.960
Looking over top at the town of contention.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.160
We're topping contention.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.120
Contention's such a power bottom, guys.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:34.240
This story ends on an unseasonably cold December 6th in a small town called Contention.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.240
A snow flurry can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.880
I don't want to, I don't want to tell you how to do your job unless it's like super

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.400
important that it's snowing.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.880
Wouldn't it be perfect if it's unseasonably warm?

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.440
No, I already wrote it all like this.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:53.920
I like it.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.560
Was it unseasonably warm when we started playing?

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.880
Yeah, now it's like I described snow on like half the shit in this.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.760
That's me talking about snow.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.840
Let's just take out the snow stuff though.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.880
Yeah, what if you didn't?

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.680
What if it was-

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.180
Okay.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.600
Can you rewrite it really quick?

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.000
You know what?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.800
Hey, how about this?

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.520
Let's try it out.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.480
I'm gonna, I'm gonna say what I prepared.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.880
We'll plug in no snow.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.760
No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna-

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.680
Every time I say something about snow, you guys all say no snow.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:25.920
Okay?

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.520
Are you ready?

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:27.760
Yeah.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.680
That's not, that's not ruin what you've written.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.960
Yeah, I want to hear it in its, in its wholeness.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.640
Well, you guys aren't playing along.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.360
Thomas will fucking do it.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:35.920
I'll play along.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.040
This story ends on an unseasonably Jack Pearlman.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:54.560
This story ends on an unseasonably cold December 6th in a small town called the Contention.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.520
A snow flurry-

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.080
No snow.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.720
Can be seen under the street lights on an empty country road.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:07.520
A snow flurry is a light snowfall that results in little or no snow accumulation.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.400
He said the thing.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.320
Ahead, there's a blockade made of splintered church pews obstructing the exit

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:19.280
and the sign from Subtropolis has been torn down and spray-painted with instructions.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.640
Says detour, please keep right.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:29.200
In the quiet parking lot of Hotel Motel, an empty dunking booth sits alone.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.080
The door to Keith's room is open and the door to Keith's safe is open as well,

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:41.280
revealing the empty place where he kept the watch he stole from his brother's cold wrist.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:48.320
At the corner of a desolate intersection, the burned-out husk of a truck is wrapped

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:55.920
around the base of a billboard for a wild business called Owls, Tires, and Tigers.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.720
But the word tiger and the picture of the tiger have both turned to ash,

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.680
making the business look far more mundane.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.240
Out north of town, John Lee Pettymore's house sits abandoned.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.640
Two sizable holes had been dug deep into the property.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.040
Inside, the house is still a mess.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.800
There wasn't much time to clean after Keith turned it inside out,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.120
looking for cocaine that was buried.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:30.720
And Thomas, what does any Pettymore who knows anything know about what John left here?

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.600
Well, John left his millions of dollars.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.080
Fives of millions of dollars.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.320
Five million dollars hidden somewhere on this property.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.000
Across town is a small vacant baseball diamond.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.760
Little bits of snow fall and melt on the metal bleachers,

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.360
which are lit by a concession hut neon sign for the contention trucks.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.480
Trucks bring it.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.360
Trucks bring it!

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.480
Trucks bring it!

01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.440
Trucks bring it!

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:06.400
Clark Bishop's parents' house exists, barren as ever.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:14.400
Light flickers out the open front door in a way which shows the television is still on.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.040
At the twice-forsaken vampire-themed water park, Splashylvania,

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.160
the spiraling duet of slides that are the two-fanged plunge

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.480
have been stained brown with the blood of Leo Piston and Julie Maxwell.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.480
Curiously, the sign for Klinker's local drinking hole and unrivaled daycare

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.120
seems to be missing seven letters from its list of happy hour bottle specials.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.880
Corona is missing an N, so Coroa.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.200
Bush Lite is missing an L, so Bushite.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.560
Past Blue Ribbon, which is missing S-T-U-E-N.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.360
Pab- Pable Ribbo.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.080
Pable Ribbo.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.480
I have one, Pable Ribbo.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.360
Is it perhaps R-S-T-L-N-E?

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:01.920
It is not.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.280
It is N-L-S-T-U-E-N.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.120
The contention woods are silent.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.640
There are no people.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.480
There are no animals.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.120
There's only a slight chilly breeze pushing on the trees gently

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.280
as the flurry of snow falls at an angle.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:22.880
No snow.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.560
Back in the suburbs.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.400
Looking through the busted front window of James the Millworker's house

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.400
treats the viewer into an empty grand piano.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.440
Not a string to be hit with a hammer to be found.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.720
However, scratches on the tile leading out the front door

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:48.640
show that something heavy and metal was pulled up from a hiding spot

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.040
under the kitchen floor and dragged out of the house.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.560
Over at A Plus Storage, three storage units, G10, G11, and G12

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.120
sit unlocked, open, and completely empty.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.440
The halls of the First Church of Contention are flooded by two feet of water

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.920
and countless fish swim contentedly from the Sunday School classrooms

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.080
to the chapel to the baptism tank, which is still filled with water.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.160
Alternatively, Chief Maggie Cook's home burned to the ground

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:28.720
is just a plot of carbon debris that looks out on a sloppily refilled beans pond

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.800
next to which lays the lifeless body of Anne Love

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:39.120
dressed to die in an emerald green suit with a black silk bow tie.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.880
Her face is frozen in a cold, vacant smile

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.920
behind icy asymmetrical bangs covering one of her eyes

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:55.040
and a big chonky fluffer of a snowflake floats down

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:01.920
and lands directly on Agent Karen's exposed blood-red eyeball.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.720
The delicate solid slowly dissolves, fills the convex reservoir,

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.200
and a single crimson drop pushes over the edge of the eye-skin basin

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.800
and runs down the face of the woman who killed Clark Bishop's parents.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:30.000
As we zoom out, we see the knife he plunged well through the top of her shattered skull.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.200
And we continue to zoom out over the quiet town of Contention

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:42.800
until Keith, he gets everybody that's coming with and just snaps his fingers

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.560
and they all show up in the pretty much decimated Contention.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:54.160
Keith pops back into hundreds of Keiths and shouts

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.600
Clean up, clean up, everybody do you share?

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.360
A montage of... Hell yes!

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.520
Cleaning montage. How does Jack Pearlman clean, Justin?

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.800
I mean, handsomely.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.280
We can all agree on that. Whatever he's doing, it looks good.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.240
I picture Everett Pace like fully hunched over but going like a million miles an hour.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.200
Does he have like a little tiny broom with a dust pan?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.040
No, yeah, I was gonna say he's not going 100 miles an hour.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.240
He's actually really focused on like one little patch of dirt that he can handle himself.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.680
Get this right in here, alright?

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:48.480
You literally get one little like intersection median just looking fucking excellent.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.600
You could eat off of this here.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.120
It's grass and dirt and like flowers and shit.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.440
As the sun goes down, Keith pops back into one Keith and

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.560
Okay, it's probably about six more days of this and then we'll be set in Keith tension.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.840
Rinse and repeat for six more days and then...

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:15.120
Okay, so during this time a few people have heard tell that you are giving away things.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.640
Your reward, yeah, you're giving away wishes, of course.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.880
Thank you for rebuilding Keith tension.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.640
Exactly. Fucking great.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.680
You've got like a campaign slogan, there's signs up.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.640
Keith Vermeer.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.400
Already?

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.560
Well, first off, Gary Daley is going to approach Keith with enormous eyes and a sort of reverence.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.920
He almost bows as he holds up.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.960
Don't be silly.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.160
He holds up this figurine of Harry Klinker that you gave him.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:51.280
I've been working real hard for the past four days and we only got two more to go and I know

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.960
Harry'd be real good at working alongside us and getting Keith tension all up and ready to go.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.600
If you could, if you could do me that favor.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.800
You want me to bring him back?

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.040
Well, I want one.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.600
I know that's bad.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:13.200
I know that that means that I'm taking him from one of me, but I'm me and I want, I want one.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:13.920
Can I have one?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.760
I don't see how anything could go wrong.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.240
Yeah, no.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:19.620
Okay.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.680
Keith thinks real hard.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.920
Oh wait, can you give me one that was like really close to like the same kind of world

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.000
that I lived in where all this stuff went nutty, but then like at the last minute, maybe he's like

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.760
saved and different or maybe one where I'm dead.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.640
Oh, that'd be good.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.520
One where I'm dead.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.880
Keith's like, yeah, sure.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.920
But it's just the first one that opens up.

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.680
He gets that, gets that one.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.080
Okay.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.400
So do you want to roll for me?

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:44.800
Yeah.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.120
Okay.

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.320
So what is, what would be good for me and what would be numbers?

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.200
A one out of 100 shot that this is a good.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.480
You tell me numbers.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.800
Any number or like a range of numbers?

01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:01.040
I would say any number will do, but that would mean the range.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.640
Like I roll under a certain thing.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:09.280
Oh, under 49, under 50 or over 50.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.240
Okay.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.400
So under 50 is good.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.280
Under 50 is good.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:15.780
Okay.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:18.260
Fuck.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:19.280
92.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.160
Okay.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.120
So shitty.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.160
The world that opens up.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.520
This is what it feels like to be a player.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.080
And I hate it.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.120
The world that opens up.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:26.880
Welcome to hell.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.040
They, they are super close with each other.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.600
Nothing bad has really happened in their lives until one day.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.000
Okay.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.840
Keith just shows up, grabs him off the sofa, blips back and it puts him in key tension.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:52.400
Harry, Harry.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.520
I miss you so much.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.480
What the oh, oh no.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:57.840
Oh shit.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.680
I rolled sanity.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:01.840
11.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.800
Chris success.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.680
Harry clinker completely understands the situation.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.000
God, God, that's you.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.400
Keith.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.200
You can call me Keith.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.760
Oh my God.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:10.960
Little hot dog boy.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.640
What little hot dog became God.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.680
What kind of sick world you bring me into?

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.880
I like this a whole lot.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.920
Hey, Hey.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.280
This worked out so well.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:21.920
Oh my God.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.640
You rolled bad.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.200
I wrote good.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.920
Hey, I love that.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.280
Can we open up clinkers here?

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.800
That way we can get a good time rolling.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.760
I've snapped my fingers in a hundred Keith's instantly rebuild clinker.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:34.260
Fuck.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.760
Daycare's open.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.920
Mildred Mitchell comes in hot, dragging her Tildy B Mitchell by the ear.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:53.680
This Tildy B is now wearing a pair of big bull britches.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:00.800
And Mildred looks at this Keith and is like, you're going to make this right?

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.440
How?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:01.920
I can.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.440
This is you, right?

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.640
I can get you.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.960
I can get you your Tildy.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.480
You did what to my daughter?

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.760
And then you do this?

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.280
Do you know what happened to your daughter?

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.920
She starts crying immediately.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.080
Let's go of this fucking Keith, pushes her away, falls to her knees and starts crying

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:24.880
onto the ground.

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.080
I saw what happened, what you did to her.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:30.720
She's okay.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.400
I'll show you.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.240
And he, uh, gets her Tildy.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.520
You fucking piece of shit.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.640
Oh my God.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.160
All right.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.360
Ask and ye shall receive, Mildred.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.000
Oh no.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.240
I love when given the chance to be a good person with godlike powers, Keith is still

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.280
like, what could I possibly do to make this person be happier?

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.880
I don't understand emotion.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:04.720
It makes a lot of sense to me that once there were infinite keys, he understood so much

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:05.040
less.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:14.880
Walking through this portal is a skeletal creature with skin so thin, her bones protrude

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.680
into view.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:24.320
Her nail beds are empty, bruises and lesions cover her body and with pure hatred in her

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.560
eyes, Tildy B. Mitchell shrieks.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.920
Okay, I'm gonna try some magic on her.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.720
And he like kind of reaches his hand out and as you reach your hand out, go ahead and roll.

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.960
That's a thorny vine.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.680
Yeah, that's a success.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.640
So what happens to her skin and body to make her look normal again?

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.960
Fingernails grow back immediately.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.680
It's a great start.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.640
Her skin plumps up, gets some color to it.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.520
Her hair quickly grows out.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.360
It's almost too long now.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.520
You're doing great.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.080
You're doing great.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.200
What else happened to her?

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:29.760
Her scream turns into like a little girl's cry and everything else is better.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:41.520
The two of them run off in a warm embrace, crying and speaking to each other like they

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.560
haven't in days.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.440
You're welcome.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:49.920
The old west folk get their saloon.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:56.560
Everett Pace gets his little shack at the edge of a vast tract of land owned and roamed

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.640
by one Jack Pearlman.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.800
The sun is hitting the dew on the long grass of this pasture and you see a couple horses

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:14.000
and you see, you see, uh, Oh my God, my brain doesn't work right now.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.840
Are you trying to say Jack Pearlman?

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.480
Jack Pearlman.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:16.980
God.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.680
We're all like sitting here like, is he going to fucking say?

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.180
I'm blue.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:25.920
Teasing you guys.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.760
You see Jack Pearlman riding on his horse past the little shack.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.520
He looks very content.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.320
Shun.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:40.720
And he's like morning Everett and Everett's out there on, on his, his parcel in the yard

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.720
there in his long John's.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.760
And, uh, he's, he, he had just gotten out of a tub of water that he had been bathing

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:48.260
in.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.680
And, uh, the, uh, the top of the long John's is hanging off and he's all skin and hunched

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.480
over bones.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.200
And, Oh, Hey, Hey Jackie, you just, you just caught me in the, I was getting out of the

01:21:59.200 --> 01:21:59.700
tub.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.480
Thanks again for this plot of land here.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.920
This is, this is, this is what this is all I ever dreamed of.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.280
Anytime Everett.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.400
Anytime.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.360
He gets back to buttoning up his, uh, long John's and he's, he's going to go back inside

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.120
and, uh, go and check the stock down in his, uh, his root cellar there.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.040
He's living a simple life out there.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.240
Investing in stocks.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:21.540
Yeah.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.200
S T A L K S

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:30.660
Nice.

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:35.700
And finally, Luke, tell me what Keith has been up to.

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:43.060
Um, he stands at the, is it pulpit pulpit, pulpit, pulpit.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:52.180
He's got a choir of Keith's off to the side, kind of singing like that behind him is stained

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:58.980
glass with various depictions of Keith, his dog beans, some other characters.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:22:59.480
Oh yeah.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:03.320
You know, so many other story of Keith in stained glass.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:03.560
Yeah.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.280
But everybody kind of looks like Keith a little bit.

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:06.780
Yeah.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:16.920
Even beans kind of looks like a man face dog, man face dog.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.520
That's the villain of the next season.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.600
And yeah, the camera.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:32.920
Pans, pans, pans, the camera pans to the pews and it's filled with everybody that came

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.040
back to contention and a lot of people that kind of look like Keith.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.200
There were a bunch of people from the city too.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.960
So they would all be here from the city and Keith's up there like, yeah.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.520
So that's basically how, um, how this all happened.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.800
Uh, you guys have any questions for me?

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:57.080
Then we pan up and out of the first church of contention and we see the sign that says

01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:59.560
welcome to Keith tension.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:05.320
I've got right here something I'm calling the loose threads montage.

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.160
Are you ready for the loose threads montage?

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.680
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:12.920
You could have called it a cop out.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.040
We didn't have any loose threads, did we?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:23.960
It's going to be a short segment.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.800
Loose threads montage!

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.000
Loose threads in the world's tightest RPG podcast.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:42.600
Two United States senators stood arms crossed behind a thick pane of glass.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.440
Oh wait, it's threads we never even touched?

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:51.960
This is acts like, Hey idiots, here's the parts of the game you never, you could have

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.520
met senators, you fucking morons.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.080
But like, Nope.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.560
He did say every time, you know, he's like, I've got these characters and they're moving

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.440
while you're moving.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.840
And if you interact with them, that's what happens.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.640
But otherwise they're still following their own agendas.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.960
We just didn't know it included the fucking president.

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.720
Two United States senators.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.480
We could have called the president.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:25.800
They stood arms crossed behind a thick pane of glass as they watched an entire lab full

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:32.280
of gaunt, tall men in white lab coats over black suits work with unnatural efficiency.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.880
And one said to the other, so that's what I've been trying to convey to you.

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.840
I'm not saying you have to vote yes on the bill.

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:46.280
These things are telling you that you have to vote yes on the bill or they'll kill you

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.400
and your husband.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.600
You remember that couple, that bar corp guy's parents, they were found at home with their

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.560
head smashed in.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:57.720
That's what William and Lena beans got for having spines.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:03.640
So now, and he kept talking as all these translucent skinned lab coated creatures, one by one,

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.960
began popping and morphing into myriad types of Keiths.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.520
And just as suddenly they each blipped out of existence entirely.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:20.760
We zoom into the back wall of this now empty lab and focus in on the myriad logo, four

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.040
double helices forming a capital M as in myriad.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:34.280
And the M logo fades and reveals an ink M formed by a typewriter that has also finished

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.760
the name that follows, which is Marvin.

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:43.480
We're in a dark smoky room and a shaky pair of hands has just placed a transparency of

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:50.760
this file on the glass family crime boss on a dusty old overhead projector.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.760
A grumbling man says, Marvin Glass is dead.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.760
The other voices in the room, rhubarb, peas and carrots, and someone says, who will take

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.560
over the business?

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:10.120
And the same shaky hands replace Marvin Glass's overhead sheet with one that shows a picture

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.320
of Keith's genius niece, Francis beans.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:21.960
This picture of Francis on the wall of this murky room morphs into the bloated lifeless

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:29.880
face of the Francis beans you all left to drown face down in Marvin Glass's fish tank.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:37.480
But the long wobbly fingers of a strangely shaped woman and wonky goggles slowly tap

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.320
against this corpse currently dead face.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:50.200
With her other hand of equally long wobbly fingers, this mad scientist types out a to

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.920
do list in her phone's notes, which is like a notebook, but on your phone.

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:08.440
And she types to do kill Kennedy, kill Harrison, kill McKinley.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.800
Triangle shape screen wipe!

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.480
Agent McKinley, the old man with dead eyes, is secured to a chair by his straight jacket

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.960
in the middle of a small padded room.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:28.120
The door opens and agents Kennedy and Harrison on either side make way for Donovan Westhaven

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:31.000
in a new black suit.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:38.120
Donovan walks up to the room's threshold, raises his pistol, fires, and the three agents

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.600
walk away down a hall and into a spacious, well decorated office.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.320
A woman welcomes you into her office.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:55.640
She has shoulder length, curly hair, and a mouth that not only takes up half of her face,

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:01.080
it is showing an amount of unbridled pleasure you can barely comprehend.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.240
Donovan!

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.800
We're almost out of these code names.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:12.680
So go ahead and choose between Agent Taylor or Agent Garfield.

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.960
I guess I'll be Taylor.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.880
Agent Taylor it is!

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:16.920
Okie dokie!

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:19.480
Okie dokie, yeah.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.800
Your next mission is to retrieve a missing person!

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:24.300
Yay!

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:31.560
And she opens up a folder to reveal a picture of the man who disappeared at his daughter's

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.840
funeral, Stan Manstein.

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:42.200
Cut to Stan Manstein as he picks up the receiver of a phone and begins talking into it.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.880
Cut to whatever is on the other end of that phone.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:49.560
That would be the Myriad in Keith's body.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.360
Yes.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.560
That's in a cage.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:51.960
Yes.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.560
Forced to answer that phone.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.200
Where?

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.520
In the contention police department.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.640
The Keith tension?

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:00.600
The Keith tension keith department.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:11.240
That Myriad that's trapped in Keith's body is in a cage in the Keith tension police department

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.920
and it answers the phone.

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:20.120
It writes down notes into a notebook, rips off the page, and hands it, pokes it through

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:28.280
one of the small holes of its cage to the noir overseer here in Keith tension.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.160
What does he look like?

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.560
I mean, picture a noir detective.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.600
He's wearing it because that's what he did when he designed it.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:39.640
I don't know what that means.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.320
That's exactly how he did it when he put together this costume.

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.120
It's a long trench coat with a fedora and just a button-down shirt with a tie that's already

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.480
haphazardly tied around his neck.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.280
He's already had a day, it looks like.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.880
He's got stubble.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.320
Yeah, this is the overseer as a noir style detective.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.360
Yep, I love it.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:06.840
You love it.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.720
We're all here for it.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.840
This is his reward.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:16.040
He takes the piece of paper out of this myriad's hand that's still in the form of Keith for

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.960
some fucking reason and in this cage.

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:19.960
No one will ever see him anyway, it doesn't matter.

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:24.360
Blips out to solve his case in a blink of blinding light.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.880
Okay, yeah, so contention is rebuilt.

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.280
Everybody is having a great time.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.320
Seemingly happy, yeah.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:36.200
I've granted wishes to anyone that asked them of me to the best of my ability.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.400
Everybody's having a great time in this weird

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:40.440


01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:49.320
Every time the overseer gets back from one of his cases, he describes it to Keith, who

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.560
is doing a true crime podcast.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:55.400
Do you do the podcast live every Sunday from the pulpit?

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.920
Yes, yes, it's recorded and mandatory.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:07.720
In order to be a citizen of Keith Tension, you have to go to story time on Sunday night.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:09.080
Oh my God.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.440
Um, and after, you know, a few weeks of this, everybody's getting settled in and it's kind

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:15.960
of a Keith-topia, really.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.240
Well, literally, if you know what that means-

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.160
Shut up, Thomas!

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:31.960
Appropriate.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:42.840
Fucking, anyway, yeah, one day Keith is finishing his Sunday morning service and everybody goes

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.600
outside the church and there's a big dark something in the sky and everybody's like-

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:52.040
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a Keith.

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:59.240
As it gets closer, you can tell it's like thousands of Keiths carrying a giant iron

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:02.920
dome and Keith is like waving them in, like they can-

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:03.960
Oh my God.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:11.000
Yeah, and he gets- make sure it gets centered and they put it over the town of Keith Tension

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.960
and so now everybody can enjoy the darkness.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.400
Oh my God.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:22.520
Luke, that's literally what Mr. Burns did to Springfield in the Simpsons.

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.160
And we're from Springfield.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:27.080
Yeah, but it's an iron dome.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.600
The Simpsons- I'm just saying, the Simpsons predicted-

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.560
Oh shit.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:43.080
Over the centuries, this town develops no eyeballs, but they can, you know-

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.680
No more of that, no more of that.

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:47.080
The cave people who keep tension.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.520
I don't want to think of the mole people who love contention.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.920
You don't go to the dome.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.560
You'll not date a dome girl.

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.520
She has no eyes.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.520
But father, I love her.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.360
I'll hear no more of this.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.160
She sees more than any other girl I know.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:14.360
She sees more than you, you blind old fool.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.160
Mary and Caroline, I'm on the borderline.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:38.920
Leaving my mind at your altar, crossing the double line, doing it every time.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:44.360
Tell me what kind of world are you living in?

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:53.400
What kind of world are you living in?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.840
And the channel changes, and we see the tops of trees,

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.760
thick enough to obscure any view of what is below and covered in a layer of kudzu.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.080
They seem to go on endlessly.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.400
Up and down, over hills and valleys, mountains and gorges,

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.240
there is nothing but dense, verdant forest.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:19.400
A circular, calm lake finds itself somewhere in the midst of this lush wilderness,

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:26.040
and in the middle of that lake, a small island with less than a quarter mile from shore to shore.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:33.400
Stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape fill varied gardens and planters

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:37.960
that somehow both overrun the terrain and complement it perfectly.

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:45.560
There's a small welcome sign that reads, welcome to calm, comfy campground.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:52.840
At the edge of the water, Maggie Cook sits on top of a bulky metal box.

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.840
Based on the path left in the wake of this thing,

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:01.640
it took some real elbow grease to drag this hefty container all the way out here.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:06.520
But Maggie doesn't look tired from hoofing this thing out to the lake.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:12.120
She looks mentally exhausted, emotionally brutalized.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.720
She looks done.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:24.280
Her dad is dead, Fergie is dead, Leon is dead, Anne is dead, and Clark isn't coming.

01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.760
She failed everyone, she failed herself.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:36.600
Maggie Cook stands up and walks toward the large, equally cute and cozy,

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.400
hexagonal building in the middle of this island.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:47.800
Inside, she finds a thick manila envelope, and her own handwriting is scrawled,

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.880
New Maggie in black marker.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:59.880
She picks up this envelope, holds her new life against her chest, and opens a door

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:07.160
into a room completely filled with stunningly gorgeous flowers in every shade and shape.

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.360
Maggie Cook takes a deep breath, and shuts the door behind her.

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.260
Welp.

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:26.040
Looks like it's about time for me to leave this newfangled contention.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.960
One Keith was too much for me, much too much.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:35.800
But more than that, I can smell that I might be needed elsewhere in some dimension.

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:43.480
I've sopped up all the grease a growin' boy like me can round these parts.

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.920
It's time to move on to greasier pastures.

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:53.240
Me and my dog, Wolf the dog, will always be there when you need us.

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:58.600
Just look for us to be, uh, grabbin' a bite at your local diner's dumpster.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:05.400
Remember, y'all, this ain't goodbye, it's smell ya later, my babies.

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:12.200
My children, my most trusted confidants, my mortal enemies.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.840
But before I go, I do have a brand new song here hot off the presses.

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.800
Too hot to handle, ouchie ouchie.

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:30.680
It's time to premiere this fresh track, this tasty, toasty sonata of a new release.

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:33.480
You never heard this song before.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:47.400
It's kudzu with no back bone.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:39:01.400
Hot dog.

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:14.920
How am I the only one tryin' to pull over?

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:23.400
How can ya have enough drownin' out of the noise?

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:37.960
With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone.

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:45.160
Fight, fight, street me down, takes me back to where you're from.

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:56.200
Don't stop, a dime of devotion to only one.

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:15.240
With no back bone, no back bone, no back bone, no back bone.

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:53.240
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.

01:40:53.240 --> 01:41:20.280
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:30.280
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up, don't give up.
