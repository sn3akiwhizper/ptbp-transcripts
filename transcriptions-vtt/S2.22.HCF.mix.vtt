00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Welcome, listeners new and less new.

00:04.200 --> 00:10.120
I've been informed by my producer that it is perfectly fine for anyone to start right

00:10.120 --> 00:12.160
here if they want to.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.240
No previous episodes are required.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.640
These next four episodes, they are here for all of you, dear listeners.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.840
However, the previous episodes are pretty good, so I've been told.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.720
I still have not gotten access to a smart device to listen to these so-called podcasts

00:32.720 --> 00:35.120
I hear y'all screeching about.

00:35.120 --> 00:41.440
Feel free to go back to the start of season two, or heck, even go all the way back to

00:41.440 --> 00:43.120
season one.

00:43.120 --> 00:50.120
Okay, now that I got that stuff out of the way, I can properly introduce myself.

00:50.120 --> 00:59.400
I am DJ Wolf the Dog, and you are listening to the radio station known as 694.2 PTBP,

00:59.400 --> 01:05.440
the crustiest and mustiest radio station this side of the Great Lake.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.240
You all know the one.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.500
I heard it's got fish in it.

01:09.500 --> 01:16.600
Now we hear it pretending to be people love to receive fan mail in the form of electronic

01:16.600 --> 01:17.600
mail.

01:17.600 --> 01:24.320
When I get one I like, I go ahead and scream it out loud in everyone's favorite segment,

01:24.320 --> 01:25.800
Howlin' with Wolf.

01:25.800 --> 01:31.360
This very special edition of Howlin' with Wolf is one of those breathtakingly beautiful

01:31.360 --> 01:40.260
five-star reviews from Apple Podcast, and it's from I gots a cool in Great Britain.

01:40.260 --> 01:46.120
If you talk about wolf in your five-star review, I just might howl at two.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.980
I gots a cool rights.

01:48.980 --> 01:51.680
This show is just the real deal.

01:51.680 --> 01:55.240
Stellar writing and an amazing cast.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.200
Just finished the first season in all of the extra one shots and about to start season

02:00.200 --> 02:01.340
two.

02:01.340 --> 02:06.880
Thank you for providing me with entertainment whilst I drive my forklift every night for

02:06.880 --> 02:08.920
the last couple months.

02:08.920 --> 02:15.120
And thank you for inspiring me to run my own Delta Green scenario.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.000
Keep up that good work.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.600
This bit's just for you, Wolf.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.000
Keep on howlin' the way you do.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.720
Ain't nobody eatin' the trash quite like you.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.040
Well, thank you, dear listener.

02:29.040 --> 02:36.640
Your review makes the sparkle in my producer's eyes shine once more, and I can say I also

02:36.640 --> 02:39.440
appreciate the things you said to me.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.360
I hope you have fun liftin' them forks.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.080
Sounds like a dream job to ol' Wolfie.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.760
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod on an

02:51.760 --> 02:59.000
Instagram story or an Instagram post, or tag at pretending pod on a Twitter tweet, or tag

02:59.000 --> 03:04.800
pretending to be people on a Facebook post or a Facebook comment on a post, or like you

03:04.800 --> 03:10.800
heard before, write up a five-star review and mention this here wolf.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.640
Howl!

03:13.640 --> 03:16.880
Cough cough cough.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.960
Welcome back to 694.2 PTBP.

03:21.960 --> 03:27.960
You're listening to Wolf the Dog, and I am, what, I'm having a premonition?

03:27.960 --> 03:30.680
Oh gods, what is this?

03:30.680 --> 03:34.360
If you can hear me, just imagine what I'm seeing.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.560
I see a boring hotel conference room.

03:38.560 --> 03:47.520
It's so ugly, and there's a nerd in there, and he's an archaeologist, a public speaker,

03:47.520 --> 03:50.960
a crystal doctor or something.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.160
I don't know, but definitely a nerd, and there's something else.

03:56.160 --> 04:03.640
In a hotel room, there's a skinny man in a boss man suit with greased back, slicked back

04:03.640 --> 04:12.000
hair, and he's watching someone die, get murdered, geez louise.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
What's next?

04:13.000 --> 04:23.180
Oh my, it's the jungle, so jungly, so viney, y'all miss vine sometimes, no more premonitions,

04:23.180 --> 04:27.800
only vague and subtle hints through the gift of song.

04:27.800 --> 04:33.160
It's Hudson Freeman with Muscles R. Springs.

04:57.800 --> 05:14.480
If it's some consolation, I was thinking the same thing.

05:14.480 --> 05:27.120
I am now mechanization, all my muscles work like swings.

05:27.120 --> 05:32.960
What's up everybody, we're back here pretending to be people with another short story within

05:32.960 --> 05:40.000
the larger story of season two, and we are going to take you on a small journey within

05:40.000 --> 05:43.560
the city, along with a special guest.

05:43.560 --> 05:49.120
You might know her from the Good Time Society, you might know her from Dimension 20, Black

05:49.120 --> 05:55.240
Dice Society, her work with Wizards of the Coast, Magic the Gathering, her Twitch channel,

05:55.240 --> 06:01.200
Geek and Sundry, her appearances on Glass Cannon Podcast, it's Becca Scott.

06:01.200 --> 06:07.680
Oh my God, you made me sound so fancy.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.800
I guess I did do all that stuff.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.800
I think you might be fancy.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.060
I'm retiring, gotta go.

06:16.060 --> 06:20.960
She lived a long and storied career and she's gone, we got our last words here at pretending

06:20.960 --> 06:21.960
to be people.

06:21.960 --> 06:22.960
Rest in peace.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.800
You might die when you retire.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.800
You might as well.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.800
Actually.

06:29.800 --> 06:34.000
I never met a retired person.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.680
In today's content-driven society, even my grandpa has an OnlyFans.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.200
Oh shit.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.600
Oh shit, what's that like?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.600
He does his lawn work shirtless.

06:44.600 --> 06:50.280
He does it for free, you can just go see him do it.

06:51.280 --> 06:56.280
It's just like a lemonade stand box, but it says OnlyFans.

06:56.280 --> 07:02.280
Well he doesn't want people who aren't fans giving him money, that'd be weird.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.280
Yeah he doesn't accept charity.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.280
Like a true American.

07:05.280 --> 07:10.280
It's a generational thing, yeah.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.280
That upholds the Christian values I know this show espouses.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
That's exactly right.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.280
We were telling Becca before we started that we're the only Christian Delta Green podcast.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.280
And I said praise Jesus.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.280
More or less true.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.280
Thank God.

07:24.280 --> 07:29.280
I was going to try and save you all, but here you are already saved, doing the Lord's work.

07:29.280 --> 07:37.280
That's exactly right, which is why I've called this scenario Holy Cow Farms.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.280
And we're playing Delta Green.

07:39.280 --> 07:45.280
We're playing the game that we play, which is our version of Delta Green.

07:45.280 --> 07:51.280
We explained it to Becca in a short condensed version right before we got on this call.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.280
We've explained it to you occasionally on this podcast as well.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.280
Once or twice.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
Once or twice.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.280
Here and there.

07:58.280 --> 08:03.280
The best RPG players and dungeon masters I've ever met will always look straight to Cameron

08:03.280 --> 08:07.280
and say, this is a homebrewed rule.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.280
For the no one else.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.280
Well we like to play it by the book, rules as written.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.280
That's right.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.280
And that's what we'll be doing tonight.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.280
And we get really mad if you break a rule or do something wrong.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.280
That's right.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.280
And if you call us out on it online, you're wrong.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.280
You're wrong.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.280
You're wrong.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.280
Yeah, we will mobilize our armory of Tweetbots.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.280
Two stars.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.280
They don't follow the rules.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Too political.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.280
Way too much Jesus.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.280
Yeah, we got a pretty sick two star review the other day.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.280
It was great because nothing in it was wrong.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.280
That's the best kind of review.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.280
Yeah, it was like, okay, this is not for this person.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.280
That's all fair enough.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.280
They described our podcast very accurately.

08:53.280 --> 08:58.280
I like that Thomas said, well, they had to give it up for the quality of the show, even

08:58.280 --> 09:02.280
though they disagree with our politics and give us that second star.

09:02.280 --> 09:05.280
Well, they listen all the way through, so kudos.

09:06.280 --> 09:11.280
So let's get into Holy Cow Farms.

09:11.280 --> 09:16.280
We see a stale room lit by fluorescent lighting.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.280
It is filled with chairs and a long aisle that goes down the middle.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.280
There are people scattered about.

09:23.280 --> 09:29.280
It's a decent crowd, but not anything that the speaker would text a picture of the crowd

09:29.280 --> 09:31.280
to their mom that's not overcrowded.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
Anyone else?

09:33.280 --> 09:34.280
Anyone else?

09:34.280 --> 09:37.280
Text pictures of crowds to your mom to brag.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.280
Hey mom, look where I am.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.280
You'll never be here, you bitch.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.280
Oh no, different mom.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.280
Because of your agoraphobia.

09:53.280 --> 09:59.280
Above in big letters, it says City Science, City Science Conference.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.280
City Science Society presents the City Science Conference.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.280
20,002.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.280
20,002.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.280
Damn.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.280
And standing at the podium, what do we see, Joe?

10:10.280 --> 10:17.280
You see a guy who is wearing a tweed coat with a button down and a sweater vest

10:17.280 --> 10:21.280
and he's got well-kempt hair and he's pretty fit

10:21.280 --> 10:24.280
and he is addressing the crowd at a podium there.

10:24.280 --> 10:30.280
Yes, and I can confirm that this is indeed a significant find.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.280
The workers were able to break through the ground there

10:33.280 --> 10:37.280
and they were smart and to immediately notify me

10:37.280 --> 10:41.280
and I went over to take a look and it was, in fact...

10:41.280 --> 10:44.280
And you click over to the next slide on your presentation?

10:44.280 --> 10:45.280
This.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.280
It's a chunk of stone with some writing on it

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
but it's not writing that is familiar to anyone.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
It looks significant.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.280
And we do believe, I do believe, that you will be reading about this find

11:01.280 --> 11:03.280
in your history books from here on out.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.280
It's the first of its kind and it does prove, in fact,

11:06.280 --> 11:09.280
that there is a civilization that was once here and long forgotten.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.280
Now it will take some time to get more facts to you

11:12.280 --> 11:14.280
but at this time I can confirm it has been found.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.280
Everyone stands, whooping applause.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.280
Yeah! Rocks!

11:19.280 --> 11:21.280
Well, that's a find.

11:24.280 --> 11:28.280
And as someone says, that's a find, in the audience

11:28.280 --> 11:34.280
we cut to a hotel room, seemingly above where this conference is taking place

11:34.280 --> 11:39.280
sometime later as we see this same dignified academic.

11:39.280 --> 11:44.280
The person who you are with is a large, squat woman

11:44.280 --> 11:48.280
who is in her late 20s

11:48.280 --> 11:51.280
and she has a broken nose.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.280
It's like off to the side.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.280
One of her eyes is looking up at you as the other one stares at the blank TV

11:58.280 --> 12:00.280
as she's sitting at the foot of this bed.

12:00.280 --> 12:04.280
He's a little more disheveled now and there's empty gin bottles

12:04.280 --> 12:06.280
on the table in the hotel room there.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
He says,

12:08.280 --> 12:14.280
I guess I did the thing you wanted, right? Are we done?

12:14.280 --> 12:17.280
You did an excellent job, Shelly.

12:17.280 --> 12:25.280
And I deeply appreciate you handling it with a certain amount of grace and aplomb.

12:25.280 --> 12:31.280
It's very kind and nice and I think that we're going to work well together, do you agree?

12:31.280 --> 12:35.280
Of course! I do your job for me.

12:35.280 --> 12:40.280
She gives you a knowing look that's kind of a hint of confidence

12:40.280 --> 12:47.280
and assuredness in herself, but also just a foreknowledge of what saying yes to this life means.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.280
And she kind of nods and says,

12:50.280 --> 12:54.280
Alright, well, don't feel like a fish, you know?

12:54.280 --> 13:01.280
It's not any way to live, but hide away your pain, I suppose, if you want to.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.280
Do you know how many friends I've taken aside and said,

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
don't feel like a fish?

13:10.280 --> 13:16.280
I just don't want you to be flopping around on one of these hotel beds one of these days.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.280
No, I'm fine. Just celebrating is done.

13:19.280 --> 13:23.280
She nods again, heads out the door. As the door closes, we see...

13:23.280 --> 13:27.280
You said that the magazine pizza come out when?

13:29.280 --> 13:35.280
She slams the door on your drunk ass and with the door slamming on it,

13:35.280 --> 13:38.280
a text across reads, 20 years ago.

13:39.280 --> 13:45.280
The same door opens up, but we see different people inside an identical room.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.280
Luke, what does your guy look like?

13:48.280 --> 13:54.280
Vincenti Boro. Bori. Something.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.280
I mean, now's the time to choose.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.280
I had to check and from over here, it is an I. Bori.

14:07.280 --> 14:13.280
Just average height, but very skinny, wiry man with slick back, greased back hair,

14:13.280 --> 14:18.280
kind of eyes that are a little too big for his head, kind of slightly bugged out.

14:18.280 --> 14:22.280
And he's wearing a very, very nice three piece suit,

14:22.280 --> 14:28.280
just black with like little hints of red accents and white undershirt,

14:28.280 --> 14:30.280
very well dressed and manicured.

14:30.280 --> 14:37.280
And this very nicely dressed and manicured man is standing next to the same woman

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
that we saw in the previous room.

14:39.280 --> 14:45.280
And she's got one eye on you and her other eye is planted firmly on the person

14:45.280 --> 14:50.280
who is laying down in the bed with a pillow over their face.

14:50.280 --> 14:57.280
And as she pulls the trigger on the gun and red begins to expand out slowly

14:57.280 --> 15:04.280
from the top of the pillow, we cut back to Vincent Bori living his life in his home.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
What does that look like?

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
What does that look like?

15:06.280 --> 15:10.280
Vincent is cleaning up after his grandkids that are running around,

15:10.280 --> 15:14.280
making a mess in his very, very nice apartment.

15:14.280 --> 15:19.280
And once the mess is all cleaned up, fast forwards, the sun goes down,

15:19.280 --> 15:23.280
it's nighttime and he's looking up at the stars through his telescope.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.280
As you look up through the telescope and into the stars or the other way around.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.280
The stars are looking at me.

15:30.280 --> 15:36.280
You're looking at a particular set of stars.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.280
They've really taken your attention.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.280
Damn, nice stars.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.280
Look at them stars.

15:46.280 --> 15:50.280
And they begin to move.

15:50.280 --> 15:55.280
Slowly at first, one of them just darts down to the bottom left of your view.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.280
Another one jumps from that area up to the top right.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.280
What the fuck is going on up there?

16:02.280 --> 16:06.280
And he gets out a pen and paper and starts furiously taking notes.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.280
And as you're taking notes.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
And just as the stars are moving.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.280
Good notes.

16:13.280 --> 16:18.280
We cut to a picture of the notes as you're scribbling them.

16:18.280 --> 16:22.280
You've got different stars and then you start connecting all of these dots.

16:22.280 --> 16:28.280
And it makes your classic five pointed star with a circle all the way around it.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.280
And on the inside there are a couple stars.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.280
And you're not sure what to make of just two stars in the middle.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.280
But that's what it is.

16:35.280 --> 16:39.280
After he connects all those he looks at it and he snaps a pic on his phone.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.280
And starts sending it out and reverse Google image searching.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
2002.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.280
Even earlier maybe.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.280
He flips his phone open.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
And not even.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
Unfortunately nope.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.280
You could have a digital camera.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
Even a decent one.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.280
And then you take out the SD and upload it to your computer.

16:58.280 --> 17:01.280
He starts writing letters.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.280
With a drawing in it.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.280
With an ink pen.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.280
With a quill ink pen.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.280
Oh like he'd use.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.280
He's replicating the image.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.280
And he's going to do some research on scientists.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.280
We cut to a montage of you at different colleges.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.280
You in libraries.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.280
And then eventually we.

17:24.280 --> 17:29.280
Somehow all of this knowledge brings you to this point in this hotel room.

17:29.280 --> 17:33.280
And as she pulls the trigger with one eye on you.

17:33.280 --> 17:39.280
Well I appreciate you bringing this to my attention.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.280
You're quite welcome.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.280
You know I could have done that without the noise and the blood.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.280
But yeah yeah I appreciate you too.

17:46.280 --> 17:51.280
I just wanted to show you here at the top that you know.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.280
I'm not unwilling to join in.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.280
Get my hands dirty okay.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.280
I'm not going to be one of those aloof handlers.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.280
Who's just you know.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.280
Not able to handle any of your business.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.280
Because they're too busy with their own shit.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.280
I want to be.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.280
I want to be helpful.

18:07.280 --> 18:08.280
I want to be good.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.280
Do you?

18:09.280 --> 18:10.280
Right.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.280
Well in my family it's all back scratches.

18:13.280 --> 18:17.280
She scratches your back.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.280
And I scratch hers.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.280
Alright.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.280
In my family we don't hug.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
We don't shake hands.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.280
So that's what people mean when they say that.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.280
It's all back scratches.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.280
And as the backs are being scratched.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.280
We go.

18:31.280 --> 18:35.280
The camera goes deep into the textiles of the shirt.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.280
That Vincenti Bori is wearing.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.280
And through on the other side we see a jungle.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.280
The bottom that says ten years ago.

18:45.280 --> 18:49.280
And then over the top like you do in a movie.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.280
The characters walk over the camera into view away.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.280
And we see a squad.

18:55.280 --> 19:00.280
We see a team of archaeologists with equipment.

19:00.280 --> 19:04.280
And there's a security personnel squad as well.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.280
Who is at the lead of that security squad?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.280
Jimmy Corrigan.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.280
And what does Jimmy Corrigan look like?

19:11.280 --> 19:15.280
Jimmy Corrigan is about six foot two though ten years ago.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.280
Can you talk soft louder?

19:17.280 --> 19:18.280
He has a high and tight haircut.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.280
Yeah there it is baby.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.280
I'm going to have to abandon this voice.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.280
He has a high and tight haircut at pretty much all times.

19:25.280 --> 19:30.280
And ten years from now it's going to be a little less up top.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.280
I'm not just doing Luke's voice am I?

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
I don't think so.

19:33.280 --> 19:37.280
I haven't done the voice enough to have really established one.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.280
I think he's leading this column straight out of a

19:40.280 --> 19:42.280
it looks like a Jurassic Park team or some shit right?

19:42.280 --> 19:43.280
Yeah absolutely.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.280
And he like holds a hand up to bring everybody to a stop.

19:47.280 --> 19:53.280
It's completely silent except for.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.280
Skeet, skeet.

19:57.280 --> 20:02.280
Just normal jungle noises.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.280
Tree sounds, tree sounds.

20:06.280 --> 20:13.280
And up to the right of you we all see a man who has frozen

20:13.280 --> 20:17.280
but he's done so in just like an extravagantly dramatic way.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.280
He's dressed.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.280
He is I promise.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.280
I fucking guarantee you.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.280
It's a Christian podcast.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.280
Unfortunately.

20:28.280 --> 20:31.280
He's a tall wiry man in his late twenties.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.280
He's got a short beard and hands stained with dirt.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.280
He's wearing a flannel shirt, cargo pants, rugged boots.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.280
He's got a well worn backpack and a faded grey brown cowboy hat.

20:44.280 --> 20:50.280
And the tip of his shovel kind of glints and gives you a ding

20:50.280 --> 20:54.280
to show the sharpness at the tip of the shovel.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.280
I turn back and I look at, Joe what's your character's name?

20:56.280 --> 20:58.280
It's Shelley St. Blythe.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.280
Shelley you know when he's standing there like that

21:00.280 --> 21:05.280
I just can't help but feel like he's just got a lot more like magnetism and charisma.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.280
It's weird.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.280
I hope that's not an odd thing to say.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.280
Shelley's dabbing himself with a hanky.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.280
Oh yeah no if you like that sort of thing sure.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.280
No I don't. I really don't. I just think the general public.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.280
After you were drinking you kind of told me about how he gets the articles.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.280
And I'm just saying I think that's why.

21:24.280 --> 21:26.280
That used to be me god damn it.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.280
I know maybe just be a little more.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.280
Oh man if you could keep it down.

21:30.280 --> 21:36.280
Dr. Brock Hargrave says as he takes off his hat, his cowboy hat,

21:36.280 --> 21:40.280
holds it to his chest and gives you the most earnest look you've ever seen.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.280
How do you keep all that hair under there?

21:42.280 --> 21:46.280
It falls out luxuriously.

21:46.280 --> 21:51.280
And we are here to, we got to say thank you to Nathan in Texas

21:51.280 --> 21:56.280
who is a patron at the $10 or up level on patreon.com slash pretending pod

21:56.280 --> 21:59.280
who made Dr. Brock Hargrave.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.280
Thank you.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.280
Thank you very much.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.280
Thanks for making him so handsome with that sharp shovel.

22:04.280 --> 22:10.280
Oh absolute sharp shoveler this guy and Nathan big thank you.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.280
Okay so Dr. Brock Hargrave is kind of giving you the looks

22:13.280 --> 22:16.280
and then he looks back and looks at everyone and he says,

22:16.280 --> 22:20.280
crew, I think I found it.

22:20.280 --> 22:27.280
And he shoves his digging tool into the, he thrusts it into the ground.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.280
Sorry.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.280
Thank you.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.280
Good stop.

22:32.280 --> 22:37.280
He puts his, he jumps, he jumps on the, he starts to shovel.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.280
He shoves his shovel.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.280
He shoves his shovel.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.280
He shoves it hard.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.280
And he fucks the earth.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.280
Metaphorically speaking.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.280
With his dick-like shovel.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.280
The head on that shovel.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.280
Open the virgin earth.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.280
Jesus Christ.

22:55.280 --> 22:59.280
And with that, yeah, you don't hear the traditional, you know,

22:59.280 --> 23:02.280
ground jungle floor noise as he puts it in.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.280
And there's a bing, bing.

23:04.280 --> 23:13.280
And as he twists the shovel, one of the trees behind him moves.

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
That's what I'm talking about.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.280
Like that is fantastic.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
I got to give it up for that.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.280
God damn it.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
That was incredible.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.280
As impressive as that was, Dr. Hargrave,

23:22.280 --> 23:24.280
you really got to get down from there.

23:24.280 --> 23:28.280
The big cats are out at this time of the evening.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.280
Where we are.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.280
I think that was just one of the babies,

23:36.280 --> 23:39.280
but that means the mama is sure to be close.

23:40.280 --> 23:46.280
And you hear a rumble, like a great big meow,

23:46.280 --> 23:51.280
coming from inside the clearing that this tree has made.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.280
God damn it.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.280
I'm going to have to kill a majestic beast of the untamed wilds

24:02.280 --> 24:05.280
because Dr. Hargrave couldn't wait until the morning.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.280
It's Hargrave.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.280
And as the crew walks through this opening,

24:10.280 --> 24:13.280
you see a temple that is in ruin.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.280
And you see columns.

24:15.280 --> 24:21.280
And you see a massive statue of a jungle cannon.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.280
And it groans again.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.280
Dr. Hargrave, you better get back from there.

24:32.280 --> 24:37.280
And I cautiously approach the statue with my rifle pointed at it.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.280
It is a statue.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.280
And you approach it with your rifle.

24:41.280 --> 24:46.280
Dr. Brock Hargrave is sneaking up on his hands and knees up next to you.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.280
What an impish way to do that.

24:48.280 --> 24:52.280
There's a plaque written in some strange language

24:52.280 --> 24:55.280
at the base, the pedestal of the statue.

24:55.280 --> 24:59.280
He is unrolling this piece of parchment

24:59.280 --> 25:05.280
and with a crayon begins rubbing out of the corner of my eye.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.280
I see that and I think, cool.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.280
This guy has his own parchment.

25:09.280 --> 25:16.280
We cut to the entire escort, the entire crew of this archaeological dig

25:16.280 --> 25:19.280
running for your lives.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.280
As you make your way out of this tree clearing,

25:22.280 --> 25:24.280
the tree falls behind you.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.280
Dr. Hargrave, what the hell is that thing?

25:26.280 --> 25:29.280
I don't know.

25:29.280 --> 25:33.280
As he stuffs this kind of manuscript back into his backpack

25:33.280 --> 25:34.280
as you guys are running.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.280
St. Blythe is lagging behind,

25:36.280 --> 25:39.280
but he's able to kind of stumble his way up to Corrigan.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.280
Corrigan.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.280
We're paying you to keep us safe.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.280
You must keep us safe.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.280
I fucking thought I was going to keep you safe from wild animals or poachers.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.280
I didn't know what the fuck that was.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.280
I've never seen anything like that in my life.

25:52.280 --> 25:59.280
We cut back to you guys in an airplane hangar in a different country,

25:59.280 --> 26:02.280
and this woman walks up to you.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.280
She's quite fit.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.280
Shelly, you actually recognize the broken nose

26:07.280 --> 26:13.280
and wandering eye of the handler you had met 10 years ago as she approaches.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.280
Jimmy, is it?

26:16.280 --> 26:19.280
Yeah, Sergeant James Corrigan, retired.

26:19.280 --> 26:25.280
Appreciate your silence moving forward on what you saw back there, yeah?

26:25.280 --> 26:26.280
He nods.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.280
May I ask why?

26:27.280 --> 26:30.280
Do you think that the world is ready to see that?

26:30.280 --> 26:33.280
He thinks about his wife, whom he loves,

26:33.280 --> 26:35.280
and his two newborn babies.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.280
Nice pond.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.280
Yeah.

26:37.280 --> 26:41.280
Really, at this point, it's a great pond.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.280
And he kind of shudders, and he says, no, ma'am.

26:43.280 --> 26:50.280
Well, then I'd say, do you want to maybe join us again one day if duty calls?

26:50.280 --> 26:52.280
He nods and extends his hand.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.280
As the hands shake, we cut away.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.280
What's this woman's deal, though?

26:57.280 --> 27:01.280
Why does she sound 80 in everything?

27:01.280 --> 27:04.280
I was laughing when you first started doing it.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.280
Is it Jennifer Jason Leigh from Annihilation?

27:06.280 --> 27:07.280
Yes!

27:07.280 --> 27:08.280
Okay.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
Well done.

27:09.280 --> 27:14.280
Well, I mean, I wouldn't have gotten that if I hadn't just watched it with you.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.280
Just watched it with me?

27:15.280 --> 27:16.280
Yeah.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.280
Great film.

27:18.280 --> 27:22.280
Also, I was thinking of using a character like her for the other campaign.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.280
She's such a good character, and now she's mine.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.280
Yep.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.280
All right.

27:28.280 --> 27:34.280
And as the hands shake, we do that wild, old-school Batman transition

27:34.280 --> 27:41.280
where the entire screen's still going.

27:41.280 --> 27:48.280
And it says, June 25th, 2022, 10 days ago.

27:48.280 --> 27:56.280
And the camera pans up on an old Victorian home that has seen much, much better times.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.280
It sits just outside of the city.

28:00.280 --> 28:06.280
And after it says June 25th, 10 days ago, comma, or no, underneath it, nice.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.280
Good formatting.

28:08.280 --> 28:14.280
It says...

28:14.280 --> 28:18.280
The best filmmakers like to storyboard live.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.280
What does it say in Becca Scott?

28:20.280 --> 28:23.280
It says, The Hold.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.280
The Hold?

28:24.280 --> 28:31.280
This dump of a house has boards crisscrossed over every window,

28:31.280 --> 28:36.280
spray paint covering most of the exterior walls saying,

28:36.280 --> 28:40.280
Keep out and hobos will kill you in here.

28:40.280 --> 28:48.280
And other things people would definitely spray paint on the outside of this abandoned house

28:48.280 --> 28:53.280
that is obviously holding some derelicts.

28:53.280 --> 28:58.280
You know, the dregs of society, but a family to one another.

28:58.280 --> 29:04.280
First, we peer into a bedroom window on the second floor,

29:04.280 --> 29:11.280
and it's got the dirtiest bear mattress you've ever seen lying on the ground,

29:11.280 --> 29:17.280
newspapers taped up to every wall, red strings attaching them,

29:17.280 --> 29:22.280
but then sort of like a ball of string never really finished its initial job.

29:22.280 --> 29:27.280
Somebody just decided to get really stoned in the middle of whatever they were working on.

29:27.280 --> 29:34.280
A lot of unfinished projects, but a lot of things left to be uncovered in this room

29:34.280 --> 29:38.280
as you see a ladder hit against the window sill,

29:38.280 --> 29:45.280
and a mess of wiry black hair peeps up over the side.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.280
Hey fish face, you in here?

29:48.280 --> 29:50.280
Uh, yeah.

29:50.280 --> 29:55.280
Laughter

29:55.280 --> 29:57.280
Check out my score.

29:57.280 --> 30:04.280
The army surplus green rucksack she always carries lands in the living room

30:04.280 --> 30:09.280
before she slings the leg over the sill and you see this tiny bit of a woman.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.280
Meat hook.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.280
Emeline Meat Hook Pennyworth, but just known by Meat Hook,

30:15.280 --> 30:21.280
is gaunt and thin, pale skin, beady, darting eyes,

30:21.280 --> 30:26.280
always sizing up every wall of the room, every exit before stepping into it

30:26.280 --> 30:31.280
with kind of squirrel-like movements and doesn't trust nobody.

30:31.280 --> 30:35.280
Wowie zowie, Meat Hook. That's quite the take.

30:35.280 --> 30:41.280
Yeah, look at all this top ramen. I scored like 20, 30 packs. You see this?

30:41.280 --> 30:45.280
This is the good shit I'm telling you, fish face. We're gonna eat like kings.

30:45.280 --> 30:48.280
Oh, we're gonna be full to our gillyworths.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.280
That's right, just like we always say, full to the gillyworths.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.280
You know something, fish face?

30:53.280 --> 30:54.280
What's that?

30:54.280 --> 30:57.280
Even though it's never gonna work out romantically between us

30:57.280 --> 30:59.280
and we've made that very clear.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.280
That makes sense.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.280
You're the only person I can trust.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.280
Cause you're too dumb to ever lie to me.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.280
That's enough for me.

31:08.280 --> 31:17.280
Me too, buddy. Me too. Here, crunch some of this up.

31:17.280 --> 31:22.280
She just bites into a brick of dry ramen and passes it his way.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.280
He pours out some of the powder and does a quick line.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.280
Line of what?

31:28.280 --> 31:30.280
Oh, fish face, of seasoning.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.280
The ramen seasoning.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.280
I like it when it gets all up into my nasal packages

31:36.280 --> 31:39.280
and then I can only taste this shrimp lime for a week.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.280
You're weird as fuck, fish face, but I like it.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.280
Are you reassessing the romantic?

31:45.280 --> 31:46.280
He's a little freak.

31:46.280 --> 31:50.280
No, not like that. I told you, not like that. Shut up and eat your ramen.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.280
Becca, when you were describing your character,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
I was thinking the whole time like,

31:54.280 --> 32:01.280
oh, this is what a professional role player sounds like.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.280
She even got her name right on the first try.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.280
That's a pro. That's a pro.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.280
That's called reading from the notes.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.280
Oh my God.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.280
We ought to give that a shot sometime.

32:12.280 --> 32:15.280
I tried it. I got to Dr. Brock.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.280
All right, if I could get an alertness check from Meat Hook.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.280
Heck yeah. First check of the game.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.280
First check of the game.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.280
First check of the game.

32:24.280 --> 32:29.280
Alertness. Okay, I got a 50. Let's see.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.280
That's a fail. 75.

32:32.280 --> 32:35.280
From behind you, without you even noticing,

32:35.280 --> 32:39.280
which I mean immediately puts the hairs on the back of your neck

32:39.280 --> 32:46.280
at the opposite of ease, you hear a woman's voice from behind you.

32:46.280 --> 32:49.280
I saw that was quite a grab there.

32:49.280 --> 32:52.280
She stands up quick and flips out her butterfly knife

32:52.280 --> 32:57.280
and does a four point flip maneuver.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.280
Who the freak are you?

32:58.280 --> 33:02.280
That's some pretty impressive moves there, Emmeline.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.280
I appreciate you being about your wits.

33:05.280 --> 33:11.280
She steps forward menacingly and says, the name's Meat Hook.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.280
Meat Hook it is.

33:13.280 --> 33:19.280
Then she pulls open her bottom lip and there's a tattoo of like, you know,

33:19.280 --> 33:22.280
of Meat Hooks.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.280
Of Meat Hook.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.280
Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.280
The entire text.

33:27.280 --> 33:30.280
Yeah, yeah.

33:30.280 --> 33:35.280
Real small, like one of those rice art things.

33:35.280 --> 33:40.280
Which in tattoo form inside the mouth is never going to be legible.

33:40.280 --> 33:44.280
Really impressive though for a stick and poke.

33:44.280 --> 33:47.280
Especially since Fish Hook did it.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.280
He can't even spell good.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.280
Fish face?

33:50.280 --> 33:53.280
Yes.

33:53.280 --> 33:59.280
With one eye on Meat Hook and the other eye on her fishy little friend,

33:59.280 --> 34:00.280
who's a human.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.280
I'll just say that since we're playing Delta Green.

34:02.280 --> 34:05.280
I'm imagining a full on fish.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.280
She is looking at you.

34:07.280 --> 34:13.280
Her nose is extremely crooked off to one side and this woman is gaunt.

34:13.280 --> 34:17.280
This woman is skin and bones.

34:17.280 --> 34:20.280
You think dripping wet.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.280
She wouldn't even weigh two stone.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.280
What's two stone?

34:23.280 --> 34:24.280
Not a lot.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
You should know before you say it.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.280
Forty pounds?

34:26.280 --> 34:27.280
Oh, not even forty pounds.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.280
That's not good at all.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.280
Not even four stone.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.280
Maybe four stone.

34:30.280 --> 34:34.280
This is a three year old.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.280
Somebody feed this kid.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.280
Your handler has Benjamin buttoned.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.280
No, but she has seemingly shrunk.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.280
She is extremely, extremely gaunt.

34:45.280 --> 34:54.280
And Meat Hook, my name is Esther or Ruth or Solomon or Lazarus,

34:54.280 --> 34:56.280
whatever you need it to be right now.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.280
I guess you can call me Esther.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.280
A lot of people got a lot of names in this house so it's not so weird.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
Exactly.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.280
You're used to it.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.280
And what else you're used to is putting your life on the line for things

35:07.280 --> 35:08.280
that matter.

35:08.280 --> 35:09.280
Is that right?

35:09.280 --> 35:12.280
How do you know that about me?

35:12.280 --> 35:17.280
Nobody looks at me and knows that I do good stuff.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.280
Fish face like looking longingly in the corner.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.280
I see.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.280
I see you.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.280
Shut up, fish face.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.280
Yes, ma'am.

35:28.280 --> 35:33.280
Becca, what is something that someone could know if they'd been watching

35:33.280 --> 35:36.280
Meat Hook for some time, but no one in the house would know,

35:36.280 --> 35:39.280
something that you keep a secret?

35:39.280 --> 35:44.280
Oh, then no one in the house knows.

35:44.280 --> 35:50.280
She likes to appear in the window at a children's afterschool program

35:50.280 --> 35:55.280
and watch them finger paint because she never got to have that one-on-one

35:55.280 --> 35:58.280
personal attention when she was a kid.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.280
That's sad.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.280
Damn.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.280
Wow.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.280
I know more than, oh nope, did the fish.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.280
What do you know, fish face?

36:08.280 --> 36:10.280
Little combo there.

36:10.280 --> 36:16.280
I know more than you think you might think that I might know about you.

36:16.280 --> 36:20.280
Nobody knows more than they think I might know about them.

36:20.280 --> 36:24.280
I think you'd be surprised if you were to know how much that I know about

36:24.280 --> 36:27.280
what you think I don't know that I know about you,

36:27.280 --> 36:33.280
which is that I know that you stand outside that window every Thursday

36:33.280 --> 36:37.280
afternoon right at finger painting time.

36:37.280 --> 36:42.280
That's what I know.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.280
How the fuck do you know that?

36:43.280 --> 36:45.280
I know a lot and I can help.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.280
You're going to get me some finger paints?

36:47.280 --> 36:52.280
I got all the paint I need and I point to a whole collection of graffiti

36:52.280 --> 36:54.280
can spray paints.

36:54.280 --> 37:00.280
I don't need nothing from no skinny one-eyed broken nose freak.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.280
Whoa, that's not nice.

37:02.280 --> 37:10.280
What do you think that I can give?

37:10.280 --> 37:14.280
Because I think you'd be surprised once again at what I can offer.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.280
What do you want here at the hold?

37:16.280 --> 37:18.280
What's your biggest dream?

37:18.280 --> 37:20.280
You know, we've been working for a while.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.280
We're trying to bring down the man in a lot of ways.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
We're starting a revolution.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.280
We want people to know what's out there,

37:28.280 --> 37:32.280
that the government is run by lizard people.

37:32.280 --> 37:41.280
As true as that may be,

37:41.280 --> 37:44.280
we got to take it one bite at a time on our way to the top.

37:44.280 --> 37:49.280
And I've got a job that needs skills with your persuasion.

37:49.280 --> 37:55.280
I could help the hold, whether it's providing more ramen,

37:55.280 --> 37:58.280
that way you don't have to make as many runs like you do,

37:58.280 --> 38:02.280
or whether it's putting our sights on something big,

38:02.280 --> 38:04.280
maybe you got your hopes up for.

38:04.280 --> 38:08.280
Well, I guess we could use running water in the hold.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.280
That's within your capability.

38:11.280 --> 38:18.280
Also, ramen, I heard you could get ramen where the noodles are soft.

38:18.280 --> 38:22.280
I've heard tell.

38:22.280 --> 38:26.280
Only seen it through a window.

38:26.280 --> 38:28.280
How soft do you want them?

38:28.280 --> 38:30.280
How soft do you want them?

38:30.280 --> 38:37.280
I want it to mush in, to dissipate.

38:37.280 --> 38:40.280
As soon as I touch it, it's so soft.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.280
I'll give you a mouthfeel, girl.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.280
And you got to deal with it.

38:46.280 --> 38:50.280
You got to deal with it.

38:50.280 --> 38:54.280
I'm in.

38:54.280 --> 38:58.280
The people that I'm bringing to this aren't going to want you in here.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.280
I'm just telling you right now.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.280
I'm used to that.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.280
Someone just watched Andor.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.280
It's just based on the character that you made.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.280
It's just those patches on your jacket there.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.280
What do you mean the character I made?

39:11.280 --> 39:15.280
I'm just, you know, it's the choices you made with your life.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.280
As we look down and see the outfit I forgot to describe.

39:18.280 --> 39:23.280
Which is a ripped, white ribbed tank.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.280
Stained and dirty.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.280
Black ripped jeans.

39:26.280 --> 39:30.280
And of course, never leaves the house without her leather jacket.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.280
Covered in studs with a big anarchy A on back.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.280
You were noticing my patches?

39:35.280 --> 39:41.280
Yeah, why don't you give us a rundown on some of those?

39:41.280 --> 39:46.280
The Lizards Are Here is obviously prominently featured on front.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.280
Let's see, I got this one.

39:48.280 --> 39:53.280
It says fluoride is making your teeth fall out.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.280
That one's true too.

39:54.280 --> 39:58.280
Ask me for more info.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.280
That's a big one.

39:59.280 --> 40:00.280
Yeah.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.280
That's huge.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.280
What else?

40:02.280 --> 40:07.280
You know, milk isn't just for kids.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.280
I made that one myself.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.280
I'm not sure where I'm going with it.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.280
I like that one best, personally.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.280
Here's the deal.

40:16.280 --> 40:25.280
This job, it's about getting some of this information out about some of these alternative things.

40:25.280 --> 40:30.280
These three other agents that I'm bringing in on this job.

40:30.280 --> 40:34.280
They're all about keeping all of this business under wraps.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.280
Keeping it hidden from the world.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.280
I need you to be on that side of things for just this one mission.

40:39.280 --> 40:43.280
You can keep spouting off your rhetoric, however you see fit outside.

40:43.280 --> 40:50.280
This should only take, you know, one, maybe four sessions.

40:50.280 --> 40:54.280
When you say sessions.

40:54.280 --> 40:56.280
Okay, Esther, no.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.280
That's where I gotta say no.

40:58.280 --> 41:03.280
If there's one thing I can't do, it's put the kaput on.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.280
I'm not a kaputter putter oner.

41:05.280 --> 41:08.280
I'm not a kaputter taker offer, you know what I mean?

41:08.280 --> 41:11.280
I unveil the truth.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.280
What, do you want to blow the top off, kid?

41:13.280 --> 41:15.280
All of it. I don't even know yet.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.280
Look at this article.

41:16.280 --> 41:21.280
It says governor unveils new nuclear power plant.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.280
You think that's all that's in that building?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.280
I've broken in.

41:24.280 --> 41:28.280
Well, I couldn't get into a lot of the locked doors, but I'm going to find out more.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.280
Look at this article.

41:30.280 --> 41:34.280
I did find this guy with a fish head.

41:34.280 --> 41:40.280
He just goes around the room pointing at normal, everyday announcements for the public

41:40.280 --> 41:44.280
and strings leading to nowhere yet again.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.280
One day I'll put it all together. I know there's a big master plan.

41:47.280 --> 41:56.280
Well, you may not be wrong about that either, but now I appreciate your, you know,

41:56.280 --> 42:01.280
the story arc that you're on saying no to this right off the bat, but...

42:01.280 --> 42:10.280
How do we turn that smile upside down?

42:10.280 --> 42:11.280
All right.

42:11.280 --> 42:13.280
That's one of her patches.

42:13.280 --> 42:21.280
If I keep my mouth shut and I help you with your thing, not only will you get running water for the whole of the hold.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.280
That's right.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.280
Can you get me a soft ramen?

42:24.280 --> 42:25.280
That's right.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.280
And finger painting?

42:27.280 --> 42:28.280
Finger painting too.

42:28.280 --> 42:34.280
And any more information on any of these flipping through some of these articles, these dead ends,

42:34.280 --> 42:37.280
I can give you a through street.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.280
You got yourself a deal, Esther.

42:39.280 --> 42:43.280
She puts out a feeble bony hand in your direction.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.280
I crush it with my handshake.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.280
Can I unarmed combat her?

42:50.280 --> 42:51.280
Hell yeah.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.280
Yeah, you can.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.280
Oh yeah.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.280
That's a 40.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.280
We got it.

42:56.280 --> 42:58.280
That beats the 30 that I rolled.

42:58.280 --> 43:04.280
And so go ahead and roll a D4 minus one.

43:04.280 --> 43:07.280
That's a three, including the minus one.

43:07.280 --> 43:14.280
Three is a lot.

43:14.280 --> 43:15.280
I'm really sorry.

43:15.280 --> 43:24.280
As you crunch the bone in her hand, she begins to faint and hits the ground.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.280
Fish face, catch her.

43:27.280 --> 43:34.280
Fish face slides underneath, making a moist palette for her limp body to fall on.

43:34.280 --> 43:42.280
Quick, spit on that ramen to make a pillow.

43:42.280 --> 43:46.280
And with that, we cut to.

43:46.280 --> 43:50.280
You've all been invited to a Bible study.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.280
Oh no.

43:53.280 --> 44:02.280
You know that it is an invitation to an operation due to the nature of the invitation.

44:02.280 --> 44:08.280
It is delivered by email from watchingthestreetatgmail.com.

44:08.280 --> 44:18.280
It says that you are invited to a Bible study on Tuesday, July 5, 2022 at 8 Oak Avenue at 8.36 p.m.

44:19.280 --> 44:27.280
Shelley finds his in his bar cart that is an intricate carved globe that opens up at the halfway mark at the hemisphere.

44:27.280 --> 44:32.280
Is there a computer inside of it?

44:32.280 --> 44:34.280
No, it's just nice glasses.

44:34.280 --> 44:41.280
And there's an envelope sitting there because that's where they know that he'll always find their missives.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.280
It's an email.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
Yeah, he said it was an email.

44:45.280 --> 44:51.280
I was wondering why the computer thing happened.

44:51.280 --> 44:55.280
Jimmy doesn't check his email and doesn't find his and doesn't go on this operation.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.280
Well, I guess none of us find the invitation.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.280
This has been another short story.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.280
Thank you so much for joining us.

45:04.280 --> 45:10.280
It went straight to the spam filter and countless lies were lost.

45:11.280 --> 45:15.280
Yeah, Shelley's butler printed it out for him.

45:15.280 --> 45:18.280
That's the name of his dog.

45:18.280 --> 45:23.280
We need to arrive. We need to arrive at this house.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.280
So who gets there first?

45:26.280 --> 45:29.280
Would anyone scope out the place before?

45:29.280 --> 45:30.280
Oh, you know.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.280
Yeah, I kind of thought.

45:31.280 --> 45:34.280
Good hook be scoping.

45:34.280 --> 45:39.280
Okay, so I was at the library naturally because Esther told me, look out for an email.

45:39.280 --> 45:42.280
And I said, cool, I'll make an email address.

45:42.280 --> 45:44.280
Awesome.

45:44.280 --> 45:46.280
What's that?

45:46.280 --> 45:48.280
Oh.

45:48.280 --> 45:50.280
What's the A with the circle around it?

45:50.280 --> 45:56.280
The UFOs are right above you at yahoo.com.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.280
Perfect.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.280
So this is a Bible study.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.280
It ate oak av.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.280
I know these streets of the city.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.280
Avenue is spelled out.

46:07.280 --> 46:12.280
There's no oak av like the back of my hand and I go by sewer to get there.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.280
Nice.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.280
Awesome.

46:16.280 --> 46:24.280
So we see a street with a house on it that has, it's a ranch style house.

46:24.280 --> 46:30.280
Two car garage has a basketball hoop concreted in next to the driveway.

46:30.280 --> 46:36.280
And the landscaping at one time was well done, but has very much gone to shit.

46:36.280 --> 46:41.280
It hasn't been mowed in weeks and it's July.

46:41.280 --> 46:47.280
And you pop your head out of one of these little drainage ditches on the side of the

46:47.280 --> 46:51.280
road with direct eye contact with the front of this house.

46:51.280 --> 46:57.280
And you see a foreclosure sign is in the yard of eight oak avenue.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.280
Avenue spelled all the way out in all of your emails.

46:59.280 --> 47:03.280
There's a Jeep parked across the street and it's been there for a couple hours.

47:03.280 --> 47:10.280
And Jimmy Corrigan sees this like urchin pop her head out of the, uh, out of the sewer

47:10.280 --> 47:12.280
and gets suddenly like, thanks.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.280
Maybe the perimeter has been compromised.

47:13.280 --> 47:18.280
Doesn't know what's going on, but he's swivels his binoculars from his house to a

47:18.280 --> 47:20.280
meat hook.

47:20.280 --> 47:27.280
You see meat hook roll struggle out of the drainage hole, roll down the street and then

47:27.280 --> 47:32.280
pull out a can of spray paint from her bag and just spray paint an X in the middle of

47:32.280 --> 47:37.280
the street and then kiss it for good luck.

47:37.280 --> 47:42.280
Who is rolling up as this middle of the street is being spray painted as meat hook is popping

47:42.280 --> 47:46.280
out of the sewer, Vincent or Vincent.

47:46.280 --> 47:50.280
The rats in this city are getting even fucking worse.

47:50.280 --> 47:56.280
Do another lap around and we'll make sure everything's good and you can drop me off.

47:56.280 --> 47:57.280
No problem, boss.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.280
Okay.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.280
Of course.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.280
Of course I will.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.280
Nailed it.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
Thanks Joe.

48:02.280 --> 48:07.280
Thanks Goomba.

48:07.280 --> 48:09.280
Shelly St Blythe.

48:09.280 --> 48:14.280
Shelly shows up in a, uh, it's a nice town car from like the nineties.

48:14.280 --> 48:17.280
It would have been gorgeous when it was bought new.

48:17.280 --> 48:21.280
Now it's looking a little raggedy and he's pulling up and uh, he sees Jimmy and they

48:21.280 --> 48:23.280
kind of make eye contact.

48:23.280 --> 48:24.280
Jimmy like shoes.

48:24.280 --> 48:26.280
You're like shoes.

48:26.280 --> 48:29.280
He's like, no, no, no, no, no.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.280
Jimmy?

48:31.280 --> 48:32.280
Jimmy, is that you?

48:32.280 --> 48:33.280
God dammit.

48:33.280 --> 48:40.280
Uh, meat hook, uh, you are hearing this, uh, this Jimmy call.

48:40.280 --> 48:45.280
I walk over and I slam on the hood of his Jeep.

48:45.280 --> 48:46.280
What are you doing here?

48:46.280 --> 48:47.280
You live here?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
What the fuck, kid?

48:48.280 --> 48:50.280
What are you doing here?

48:50.280 --> 48:51.280
What am I doing here?

48:51.280 --> 48:52.280
I was told to be here.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.280
Were you told to be here?

48:54.280 --> 48:57.280
I was told to be here, but I drove here in my sensible vehicle.

48:57.280 --> 49:00.280
I didn't take the sewers like a fucking turtle.

49:01.280 --> 49:06.280
Oh, so you got things to say about my mode of transportation.

49:06.280 --> 49:15.280
We don't all have a fancy four wheeled vehicle, like two motorcycles with the house in the middle.

49:17.280 --> 49:21.280
Jimmy gets a, gets a flash of recognition and he's like, wait a minute.

49:22.280 --> 49:30.280
Every third Thursday when I pick my kids up from finger painting, I see them out there.

49:30.280 --> 49:34.280
I show him a picture of the kids and I'm like, you probably see them with Barbara, my estranged wife.

49:34.280 --> 49:39.280
First of all, you shouldn't show strange people that crawl out of the sewer pictures of your kids.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.280
Second of all.

49:42.280 --> 49:43.280
First things first.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.280
They're just on my mind a lot, you know, lately.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.280
I never seen your Barbara.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.280
I never seen your kids.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.280
I never seen a single finger paint in my life.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.280
You must be thinking of some other trash lady.

49:59.280 --> 50:06.280
At that time, uh, Vincenty is, walks up, he like pulls a cigarette out of his, uh, cigarette case and taps it and lights it up.

50:06.280 --> 50:10.280
He's like, well, I never seen nobody look like a fucking rat like you.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.280
Okay.

50:12.280 --> 50:14.280
You just beat up on me today.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.280
What is this?

50:15.280 --> 50:16.280
What are you doing here?

50:16.280 --> 50:17.280
Who are you?

50:17.280 --> 50:18.280
You look fancy.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.280
Are those, uh, spats on your shoes?

50:20.280 --> 50:23.280
You know what a spat is, but you don't know what cars are.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.280
I didn't say I didn't know what it was.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.280
I just said I didn't have access.

50:31.280 --> 50:32.280
I didn't have the means.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.280
Do you want to start smoking?

50:34.280 --> 50:35.280
Do you smoke cigarettes?

50:35.280 --> 50:37.280
Do you want to start smoking?

50:38.280 --> 50:42.280
Usually just butts I pick up off the ground, but yeah, I'll take a freshie.

50:42.280 --> 50:43.280
Here you go.

50:43.280 --> 50:45.280
He gives her a fresh cigarette.

50:45.280 --> 50:50.280
This is the part of our Christian podcast where we introduce like an obvious moral dilemma.

50:54.280 --> 50:55.280
Do you smoke?

50:55.280 --> 50:57.280
Do you want to start smoking?

50:57.280 --> 51:00.280
Hey, Meat Hook, do you want to start smoking?

51:00.280 --> 51:04.280
He gives her a couple of cigarettes and lights one for her.

51:04.280 --> 51:06.280
And then he looks over.

51:06.280 --> 51:09.280
He's like, Oh, you're the, you're the crystal doctor.

51:09.280 --> 51:10.280
Oh yeah.

51:10.280 --> 51:11.280
Shelly St. Blythe.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.280
You know me.

51:12.280 --> 51:13.280
Yeah.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.280
Yeah.

51:14.280 --> 51:20.280
You never returned my letters when I was asking about the sky stuff, but you're more of an

51:20.280 --> 51:21.280
earth guy.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.280
The star crystals.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.280
Yes.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.280
I remember.

51:24.280 --> 51:25.280
Yeah.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.280
We can talk about this once we get into our mission, but I got lots.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.280
I got your brain, your whole brain.

51:30.280 --> 51:31.280
I'm going to pick it.

51:31.280 --> 51:34.280
Oh, and not in the way that I usually pick people's brains.

51:34.280 --> 51:37.280
Oh, sounds ominous.

51:37.280 --> 51:43.280
Like, you know, and he starts walking into the house.

51:43.280 --> 51:45.280
She says, are you a surgeon?

51:45.280 --> 51:46.280
He's just walking away.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
In a way kid.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.280
I fear that that man is not a surgeon.

51:49.280 --> 51:53.280
The door opens as some of you approach.

51:53.280 --> 52:00.280
You see a woman that you've seen before, uh, looking at two of you at a time, nose crooked,

52:00.280 --> 52:03.280
crinkled off to the side this time.

52:03.280 --> 52:08.280
However, she is just extremely gone.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.280
So small.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.280
I mean, maybe four stone.

52:11.280 --> 52:12.280
Hey, what happened to your hand?

52:12.280 --> 52:17.280
You've doubled in size.

52:17.280 --> 52:19.280
You look bigger than me.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.280
You look good.

52:20.280 --> 52:21.280
All right.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.280
Thank you.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.280
Get in.

52:23.280 --> 52:24.280
Esther.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.280
It's Ruth.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.280
Ruth.

52:26.280 --> 52:27.280
How are you?

52:27.280 --> 52:30.280
Oh, it's, it's Rachel and Lazarus, whichever, whichever.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
Come on in.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
Come on in.

52:32.280 --> 52:37.280
And as you guys walk into this house, immediately you're hit with a stench of cat piss, like

52:37.280 --> 52:40.800
thorough, thorough cat piss.

52:40.800 --> 52:48.920
Just like that horrible, horrible acidic smell is just climbing up into your nostrils, stinging

52:48.920 --> 52:50.240
your eyes.

52:50.240 --> 52:55.160
And this house matches when it comes to whether it's clean or not.

52:55.160 --> 52:59.800
Cause it's not, it's super, super gross.

52:59.800 --> 53:03.320
And she says, how about we go with Moses on this one?

53:03.320 --> 53:04.320
All right.

53:04.320 --> 53:10.360
Now you'll see that I've been busy and you see papers, maps everywhere, circles, numbers,

53:10.360 --> 53:12.040
dates all around.

53:12.040 --> 53:18.600
You see she's written Holy cow farms on one of these maps and she kind of points at it

53:18.600 --> 53:20.120
and she's like, this is your mission.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.120
Okay.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.120
Dr. Brock Hargrave.

53:22.120 --> 53:24.000
Oh, God damn it.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.040
Do you remember him?

53:26.040 --> 53:27.440
Yes, I'm familiar.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.440
Jimmy here.

53:28.960 --> 53:33.680
Jimmy, uh, first of all, the scent of the cat piss and then the mention of that name,

53:33.680 --> 53:40.720
he is having horrifying images of the, oh yeah, of the cat statue, slain half an archeological

53:40.720 --> 53:41.720
team.

53:41.720 --> 53:42.720
Yes, that's right.

53:42.720 --> 53:43.720
Whoa.

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
Are you all right, man?

53:44.720 --> 53:45.880
I didn't mean to be so rude about your kids.

53:45.880 --> 53:46.880
I'm sorry.

53:46.880 --> 53:47.880
You can't afford a car.

53:47.880 --> 53:48.880
Thanks.

53:48.880 --> 53:50.880
You look shook though.

53:50.880 --> 53:56.600
You never smelled cat piss before?

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
Not like this.

53:57.600 --> 53:58.600
Well, once.

53:58.600 --> 53:59.600
Real grip.

53:59.600 --> 54:02.840
Listen kid, I pray you never smell cat piss like this.

54:02.840 --> 54:06.640
Honestly, this is a step up from my place.

54:06.640 --> 54:10.560
Oh, right.

54:10.560 --> 54:12.560
You live in the sewer or something?

54:12.560 --> 54:16.760
You hear a dishwasher and meat hook is like, what is that?

54:16.760 --> 54:18.000
I got a 19.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
I'm fine.

54:19.000 --> 54:24.360
Taj Mahal over here.

54:24.360 --> 54:28.640
Years of practicing that tense situations and suppressing his own emotions come to his

54:28.640 --> 54:31.720
service and he just pushes it down to his toes.

54:31.720 --> 54:36.200
And with that, you're able to kind of give a quick glance around as you hold your grip

54:36.200 --> 54:37.200
on reality.

54:37.200 --> 54:43.400
You glance around, you notice that just within this small room and kind of the rooms around

54:43.400 --> 54:44.400
you, you don't see a cat.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.640
You don't see any cat toys.

54:45.640 --> 54:49.120
You don't see a litter box, um, nothing to that.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.120
All right.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120
So, um, all right.

54:51.120 --> 54:55.520
I guess, uh, and she goes to the table and is like, I guess we'll, we'll talk here.

54:55.520 --> 55:00.800
And she just shoves all of these papers off of the table onto the ground and puts that

55:00.800 --> 55:06.600
map down that she, uh, takes off all these pins, uh, from it off the wall, slams it down.

55:06.600 --> 55:07.600
It says, Holy cow farm.

55:07.600 --> 55:15.080
She's like, this is, this is where, um, Dr. Brock Hargrave has been working and, uh, he

55:15.080 --> 55:16.080
went missing.

55:16.080 --> 55:19.200
One of his coworkers also went missing, you know, he's on the list.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.240
We need to find him.

55:20.240 --> 55:22.360
We need to figure out what happened.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.440
What's this list of yours.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.200
What's your interest in this guy?

55:26.200 --> 55:34.360
He was after something that we were looking into and he, uh, clearly maybe fell prey to

55:34.360 --> 55:35.360
the vector.

55:35.360 --> 55:40.120
But, um, that's why we're sending in you is to figure out what happened.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.120
The vector.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.120
Yeah.

55:42.120 --> 55:48.320
Vector is the word that we use sometimes to describe an unnatural incursion, like, like

55:48.320 --> 55:54.960
what you saw and looks at you too, like what you saw and looks at meat hook.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.440
Like what you know is real.

55:56.440 --> 56:02.360
I was born knowing I don't have to see nothing to know what people think is real.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.760
That's not what's really real.

56:03.760 --> 56:04.760
Ruth.

56:04.760 --> 56:09.880
You're telling me this kid has never experienced the mythos and you're bringing her in on something

56:09.880 --> 56:10.880
like this.

56:10.880 --> 56:12.600
This kid has skills that you need.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.600
Okay.

56:13.600 --> 56:16.120
I just parkour, try and climb up the wall.

56:17.120 --> 56:18.120
All right.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.120
Roll.

56:19.120 --> 56:20.120
Okay.

56:20.120 --> 56:27.760
That's a 3,250.

56:27.760 --> 56:29.040
On top of the fridge.

56:29.040 --> 56:35.160
You see me, holy fuck.

56:35.160 --> 56:36.160
This kid's good.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.160
Is this a vector?

56:37.160 --> 56:40.160
I am the vector.

56:40.200 --> 56:47.440
That's what I'm saying is that, you know, she, uh, she seems to have skills that may

56:47.440 --> 56:49.400
come into some play here.

56:49.400 --> 56:53.280
So I'm not denying her skills, but nobody knows what's going to happen to their mind

56:53.280 --> 56:56.120
when they get exposed to, to the truth.

56:56.120 --> 57:01.100
That's kind of the best part of the whole thing is that meat hook here already kind

57:01.100 --> 57:03.380
of believes the truth.

57:03.380 --> 57:07.360
Believe in what you see on the internet and seeing in real life are two different things.

57:07.360 --> 57:12.080
There's no way this kid has the internet.

57:12.080 --> 57:15.240
That's a, that's a trenchant point.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.240
Look at you.

57:16.240 --> 57:24.800
But there's a library down the street and then like, well, several sewer streets away.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.800
I'm thinking this kid might have a place in my moon rock store after this.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
Your moon rock store.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.800
Moon rock store.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
We'll see.

57:32.440 --> 57:37.480
We got to prove yourself, but you can climb like crazy and I need a climb.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.480
You need a climber.

57:38.480 --> 57:39.480
Are you serious?

57:39.480 --> 57:43.080
No one's ever given me a legit job before because of the smell.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.440
Well I smoked too many cigarettes to smell anything.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
So okay.

57:46.440 --> 57:54.840
I never thought I'd say this, but I, I think I have a good initial first impression of

57:54.840 --> 57:56.760
you.

57:56.760 --> 57:59.120
Likewise kid.

57:59.120 --> 58:03.900
Now let's go to the stinky shit cow farm.

58:03.900 --> 58:06.800
And you see that it's actually the map where it's circled.

58:06.800 --> 58:12.040
It is in a business district and it is just an office building.

58:12.040 --> 58:13.040
Damn.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.480
Ruth, do you know the sewers around here?

58:16.480 --> 58:18.040
Around all the cow farms?

58:18.040 --> 58:19.040
I'm sorry.

58:19.040 --> 58:20.040
Meat hook.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.040
Meat hook.

58:21.040 --> 58:24.720
How could you confuse the name meat hook for Ruth?

58:25.560 --> 58:26.560
Look at this tattoo.

58:26.560 --> 58:30.720
It's admittedly, it's admittedly an incredibly difficult mistake to make.

58:30.720 --> 58:33.160
Do I look like a Ruth to you?

58:33.160 --> 58:35.840
She holds out her lip.

58:35.840 --> 58:38.800
Oh, is that the entire text of weapons and clears the jungle?

58:38.800 --> 58:41.200
How did you know?

58:41.200 --> 58:42.200
In stick and poke?

58:42.200 --> 58:43.600
No one's ever guessed that before.

58:43.600 --> 58:44.600
I love that book.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.000
I've, I've got it memorized.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.360
I would recognize that anywhere, but that must have taken weeks.

58:51.360 --> 58:56.760
You know, it's like a 700 page book, so we're still working on it, but, uh, we at least

58:56.760 --> 59:02.240
got the prologue, my boy fish face.

59:02.240 --> 59:04.840
He's a good start.

59:04.840 --> 59:09.840
Fish face pokes his head in and he's like, yeah, he's been following fish face.

59:09.840 --> 59:11.240
I told you I'm striking out on my own.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.760
You can't come on this mission.

59:12.760 --> 59:13.760
Sorry.

59:13.760 --> 59:17.080
He'll be here if we need him.

59:17.080 --> 59:22.040
If you ever call for him, he's, he's home.

59:22.040 --> 59:27.880
Ruth you're telling me these two urchins who are so obviously in love, one of whom has

59:27.880 --> 59:31.720
just gotten the first and legitimate employment opportunity of her life.

59:31.720 --> 59:34.960
You're going to send them out untested on an operation.

59:34.960 --> 59:36.100
We're not meant to be together.

59:36.100 --> 59:37.800
I know it seems that way.

59:37.800 --> 59:40.800
I know it looks like we're very compatible.

59:40.800 --> 59:41.800
It didn't work out.

59:41.800 --> 59:43.800
I don't want to get into details.

59:43.800 --> 59:44.800
Fish face knows.

59:44.800 --> 59:46.080
No, I'm cool with it.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.080
Okay.

59:47.080 --> 59:50.800
See, I think that this is going to be fine for these exact reasons.

59:50.800 --> 59:53.760
Um, he does, he seems like he's cool with it.

59:53.760 --> 59:55.760
Yeah, I'm cool with it.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.080
I guess it's okay if she dies.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.080
Yeah.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:06.800
Ruth, Moses, whatever kind of looks at you with just kind of a nod that I can die.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.800
What?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:15.600
Hey kid, if you keep up the climbing around crawling like a little, little rat child,

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.620
you're going to survive.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.620
Fine.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.980
And if all else fails, get behind Jimmy.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.200
That's always been my plan.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.320
You get behind the doctor getting behind me.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.320
Oh, that Jimmy.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.320
Sorry.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.920
Uh, Vincenze really looks like a Jimmy.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
He does.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920
Yeah.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.920
I've heard it all my life.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.920
All right.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.920
Well, uh, I'm pretty quick.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.320
Thanks for noticing.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320
What's the game plan?

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.040
Well, do they know we're coming?

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:44.440
Uh, no, I mean we can, we can, she kind of points to an area in the corner where there's

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.400
some like a laminator and a printer.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.600
And she's like, I can dolly up some, whatever kind of ID you want here, uh, to get into

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600
the building.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.520
If you, if you want to start there or, uh, you guys can just go break into his house

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:07.000
or you, you know, I mean, whichever one you feel, why don't you get those credentials

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.920
ready while we break into his house?

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.480
The missing doctor's house.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480
Okay.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480
That's interesting.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.920
I mean, that's why you're here, right?

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.040
But did he go missing from Holy cow farms or did he go missing from his home?

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.040
Okay.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.520
So one of them went missing at work.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.320
The coworker went missing at work, but Dr. Brock Hargrave left that same day and then

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320
didn't come back in.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:33.680
So coworker never clocked out and Dr. Hargrave left and never came back.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.880
Sounds like Hargrave killed his friend.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880
Yeah.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880
It sounds a lot like that.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880
Doesn't it?

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.880
But for what?

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.880
It's always money.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:49.040
If I know anything about crime scenes, uh, which I mean, why would I, uh, but maybe we

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:56.280
should try to get some evidence at the holy cow farms and then present it to the doctor,

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.840
uh, in order to take him in.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:02.360
You're going to show the evidence of how he killed his friend to him, right.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.360
To make him turn himself in.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.200
Maybe not turn himself in, but have some sort of mental break and we can nab him then.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.320
Yeah, we could put on a play where we recreate what happens.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.040
So he's forced to confess out of guilt.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.920
I can put on quite a play with my puppets.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920
I'm sorry.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920
You're what?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920
You're what?

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.520
My puppets, of course.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.160
I can put on a puppet play.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.920
Okay fancy man, you got puppets on you?

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920
Thank you.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920
You've noticed.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.440
And he kind of straightens his jacket.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.960
Those were in your jacket the whole time?

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960
Doc.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720
Yes.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:41.720
This one here.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:42.720
This is.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.720
Who's that?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.720
This is Craig.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720
Mile.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.720
Craig Mile.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.720
What is Craig Mile?

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720
Craig Mile.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720
Craig Mile.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.720
Craig Mile.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720
What does Craig Mile look like?

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720
He's one of my actors.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.280
He's got a long nose and makeup around the eyes and his hair's yarn.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:05.640
Doc, how many times do I have to tell you we can only pack essentials on missions?

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.360
Craig Mile is essential.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:16.200
He makes the puppet look up at him at St. Blythe and then look away and then look back.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.520
No, he was joking.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.800
You of course are essential.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.600
Okay Craig Mile, I've got some questions for you.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.040
Yes, of course.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.340
You can talk to Craig Mile.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.960
She gets all up in his face.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.760
Tell me the last thing you heard about a doctor named Brock.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.520
Oh, Brock?

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.920
Shelly St. Blythe is doing his voice.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.320
Oh, Brock, that asshole?

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.000
The guy who thinks he can just walk into a place and all of a sudden he's the talk of

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the town?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.160
That he can just discover things?

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.400
Like he points at a thing.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.480
Oh, he discovered it?

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480
That kind of guy?

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.480
Oh, he gets my blood boiling.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.480
He knew how to twist the thing, Doc.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:58.480
Craig, I see the value of your puppet friend getting to your inner psychology very easily.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.600
No, no, yes.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.720
Jimmy knows about my history with Hargrave.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.040
He does my job better than me sometimes.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:15.640
Flashback to Jimmy opening one of his go bags and finding a puppet of himself.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:23.240
It's called Mean Jimmy and he's clearly confiscated a bunch of smaller puppets.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:31.560
Yeah, I know about your relationship with Hargrave and the puppets.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.520
Is that going to be an issue on this operation?

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.520
What?

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.520
I don't believe so.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.560
Pray to God it won't be.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:46.800
As useful as this puppet thing seems immediately, we're going to have to find some evidence

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.420
so that the puppet show can go.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:54.820
So that there's some verisimilitude to the play that I produce, yes.

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.880
This whole sewer thing, how does, are they all connected?

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.360
How do we use those?

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.040
I don't think you're sewer people.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:09.760
We should probably go in that fancy, you know, limousine thing you got outside.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.160
It's a sensible suburban vehicle.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.880
Vincenti did come in a stretch escalated.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:25.200
My eyes can't even comprehend that that is a thing that you could get into.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:31.920
As long as we don't have to take any turns and it's a straight shot there, we can drive

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.200
it.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.680
It does appear to be, but from the map, just a straight shot, but it still seems risky.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.240
That one turn at the end is going to get you.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.720
We can, hey, we can jump out and walk a part of the way if we need.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.960
I don't like doing it, but I walk 30,000 steps a day.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.760
It seems impractical.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.640
I'll page Goomba, my driver.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.660
Oh, I thought that was the purple guy from McDonald's.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.660
That's grimace.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:59.940
Anyway, no, Goomba is not a big purple monster.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:04.100
He is my driver and a decent friend of mine.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.780
Got it.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:12.940
As impractical as it might be, I think, um, we should take the giant Escalade limousine

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:18.240
cause I never ridden in, honestly, like only ridden in a car maybe twice in my life.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.820
You deserve that Escalade kid.

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:24.840
I'll be following, uh, the convoy and also comprising the only other vehicle in the convoy

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840
in my Jeep.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.320
So we're going stealth.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320
Yeah.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:07:05.760
Some constellation.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:12.560
I was thinking this.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:19.400
I am now mechanization.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:09:12.660
If I lose it on a Wednesday, it'll be cause I was afraid, you'll say it's all just metaphor.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:11:04.420
Uh, we did it.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.420
We did it.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.420
We did an episode.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.420
Well shit.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:08.420
Holy shit.

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:09.420
Easy peasy.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.420
We can get going.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:11.420
Easy peasy.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.420
Hell yeah.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.180
Easy peasy.
