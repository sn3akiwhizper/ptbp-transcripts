00:00.000 --> 00:07.020
Hola, que pasa mis perros, esta es Wolf the dog.

00:07.020 --> 00:12.200
On this week's edition of Howlin' with Wolf, we got ourselves a beautiful poem written

00:12.200 --> 00:16.960
by a listener who gave us a five-star review on iTunes.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.220
That was a super cool thing to do, listener.

00:20.220 --> 00:23.780
She writes, My dearest Samuel,

00:23.780 --> 00:29.260
You are the ying to my yang, The chicken tendies to my basement dweller,

00:29.260 --> 00:35.520
The window to my wall, The sweat that drips down my balls,

00:35.520 --> 00:41.920
You really butter my bread and stain my bits, I love you even if you keep taking weird pictures

00:41.920 --> 00:51.360
of my paddle-board feet, Wow, that is so fuckin' gross,

00:51.360 --> 00:55.020
Sorry y'all, Wolf is just jealous of all this love,

00:55.020 --> 01:01.940
It gives me wet in the eye-holes, Now, wholesome news,

01:01.940 --> 01:08.860
Officer Vigna broke into Officer Pettymore's house to find some cocaine for personal use.

01:08.860 --> 01:13.780
This is the cocaine they stole from a storage unit after finding the key at the home of

01:13.780 --> 01:16.420
a missing person.

01:16.420 --> 01:22.220
The fire at the city hospital has now claimed the lives of more than 20 individuals.

01:22.220 --> 01:27.640
The names of the deceased are not yet being released, my babies.

01:27.640 --> 01:33.260
More importantly, however, the officers of law here in contention eat the most awful

01:33.260 --> 01:35.260
breakfast food.

01:35.260 --> 01:41.700
The officers are also dealing with the situation wherein Officer Bishop seems to be in more

01:41.700 --> 01:44.080
than one place at a time.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.700
He has no recollection of this.

01:46.700 --> 01:53.300
Then, a lot of super important plot stuff happens, involving the FBI agents, the black

01:53.300 --> 02:00.280
Nike bag, a small silver sphere, and things of that nature.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.260
It seems like our boys at the local precinct might be getting called up to the big show.

02:06.260 --> 02:15.600
For all our listeners in Springfield, Missouri, contentions greatest band, Kudzu, will be

02:15.600 --> 02:21.380
playing in a show March 2nd at some place called the Front of House Lounge.

02:21.380 --> 02:26.880
In honor of this actual event, we are premiering a brand new song by Kudzu.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.580
It is No Backbone.

02:56.880 --> 03:07.720
Okay, so in order to dig into these characters a bit more, we're going to take a look into

03:07.720 --> 03:10.640
the past, starting with Clark Bishop.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.640
Howdy.

03:11.640 --> 03:17.280
I have Joe with me here today, and we are joined by a long-time Delta Green player and

03:17.280 --> 03:21.760
my favorite person in existence, Taylor, my wife.

03:21.760 --> 03:22.760
That's me.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.760
And...

03:23.760 --> 03:24.760
Borat.

03:24.760 --> 03:25.760
My wife!

03:25.760 --> 03:26.760
Nailed it.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.360
I'd prefer you not do that.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.920
So let's go ahead and get right into it.

03:33.920 --> 03:41.520
Let's flash back to a time when Clark Bishop was a much, much younger man.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.680
One might even call him a boy.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.840
Yeah, and then I'll put in that in post.

03:46.840 --> 03:51.340
It'll be like the nice dream sequence.

03:51.340 --> 03:57.580
So you are in your childhood home, which just so happens to be, if I'm not mistaken,

03:57.580 --> 04:00.620
to be the home that Clark Bishop still lives in.

04:00.620 --> 04:04.620
Do you want to give a quick description of what it looks like back then?

04:04.620 --> 04:07.160
Yeah, it's real clean.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.820
It's one of those houses that keeps the plastic on the couch.

04:11.820 --> 04:16.940
Lots of angel wings and crosses on the walls.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.940
Maybe a framed picture of Jesus.

04:18.940 --> 04:19.940
Jesus.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.620
Is it tatting?

04:21.620 --> 04:24.140
The little doilies and things on armchairs?

04:24.140 --> 04:26.580
Yeah, your chairs have tats.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.580
Yeah.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.580
Tatted.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.580
Yeah.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.580
Awesome.

04:30.580 --> 04:31.580
Yeah.

04:31.580 --> 04:37.000
So as you're going about your normal kid time, I don't know what you're doing, but your parents

04:37.000 --> 04:39.020
are in the kitchen making dinner.

04:39.020 --> 04:47.860
Pat Sajak is loud and clear over the television, and as you're playing in the living room,

04:47.860 --> 04:54.980
you hear your mom yell from the kitchen, Kermit the Frog in my throat.

04:54.980 --> 04:59.700
And your dad is like, oh, it was right there.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.940
I had the frog in my throat.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.580
I couldn't come up with the Kermit.

05:03.580 --> 05:09.620
And they're jawing back and forth, and you're looking over on the walls, you got all the

05:09.620 --> 05:14.860
pictures of the Jesus, the crosses, you got some angels.

05:14.860 --> 05:19.660
I don't know, maybe like a family picture of you guys on vacation somewhere.

05:19.660 --> 05:24.460
And your mom walks over as your dad keeps working on dinner.

05:24.460 --> 05:30.940
And she leans down to you, Clark, and she kind of like looks at the TV as Wheel of Fortune

05:30.940 --> 05:36.220
goes into its final clue in the bonus round.

05:36.220 --> 05:41.820
And she says, Clark, life is like the bonus round.

05:41.820 --> 05:44.620
We were already given the best letters.

05:44.620 --> 05:49.860
Then she gives you a big old hug and a kiss on the forehead and says, are you off to the

05:49.860 --> 05:50.860
library?

05:50.860 --> 05:51.860
Yeah, of course.

05:51.860 --> 05:58.700
You're going to go say hi to Mr. Fingerson.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
Mr. Fingerson?

05:59.700 --> 06:00.700
Yeah, of course.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.700
Yeah, go say hi to Mr. Fingerson.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.180
Tell him that we send our guards and oh, also.

06:05.180 --> 06:11.780
And she goes and grabs a little basket of muffins, lemon poppy seed muffins.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.340
Yeah, they're good.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.300
I bet he would enjoy these.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.300
Mr. Fingerson?

06:16.300 --> 06:21.540
He loves muffins.

06:21.540 --> 06:27.580
So off we see little Clark Bishop riding a bike, maybe, or contentions in small town.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.940
You could easily ride your bike.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, totally a bike.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.380
To the contention public library.

06:33.380 --> 06:38.020
When you go in there, you would see it's dead.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.020
It's dead.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.020
It's a really nice place.

06:40.020 --> 06:44.380
The general's a little musty in here.

06:44.380 --> 06:50.940
The library is not frequented often by the general population of contention.

06:50.940 --> 06:58.180
However, you do see that at the information desk, Mr. Fingerson is having a conversation

06:58.180 --> 07:01.740
with a man that I think you would recognize.

07:01.740 --> 07:06.420
His name is Gary Daley and he runs the Pho Shop in town.

07:06.420 --> 07:11.700
He is having a very loud conversation with Mr. Fingerson.

07:11.700 --> 07:16.100
Uh, yeah, no, I really like this one for sure.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.260
The true and horrifying confessions of the St. Oscyth witches.

07:19.260 --> 07:20.540
Yes, of course.

07:20.540 --> 07:28.260
If you have anything of this elaborate nature, something so esoteric, like this is the kind

07:28.260 --> 07:30.780
of stuff that is right up my alley.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.580
Oh, yes, Mr. Daley.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.620
We have quite a bit in the occult.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.500
I can surely gather some materials for you.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.340
Tell me, what are you going to be reading these for?

07:40.340 --> 07:44.880
Oh, I am just perusing them because I enjoy the story.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.740
See nothing, I don't know.

07:46.740 --> 07:51.660
It's just life is a little bit too bland and I like spicing it up.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.200
I completely agree.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.300
Often I feel in contention.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.260
I don't feel fulfilled.

07:56.260 --> 08:03.060
Perhaps if I had made better decisions in my younger life, I would be a greater man.

08:03.100 --> 08:09.420
Jerry Daley walks away with his book and kind of denotes where he's going to be sitting.

08:09.420 --> 08:10.420
Like, huh?

08:10.420 --> 08:11.900
Well, I'm going to be right over here.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.300
Oh, Clark, thank goodness you're here.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.300
Hey, Mr. Fingerson.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.300
Oh, please call me Gerald.

08:17.300 --> 08:18.300
All right, Gerald.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.300
No, no, no.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
Good sir.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.300
It is Gerald.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.300
Oh, of course.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.420
Extend that short O.

08:25.420 --> 08:29.940
I always mess that up, Mr. Gerald.

08:29.940 --> 08:30.940
That's very close.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.920
We'll keep working on it.

08:32.920 --> 08:37.080
It's only been, what, seven months that we've been practicing?

08:37.080 --> 08:38.560
I'll get there one day, I'm sure.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.720
Oh, I'm sure you will.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.720
And what brings you here today?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.040
Well, first of all, here.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.040
My mom made these for you.

08:43.040 --> 08:45.080
Oh my goodness, muffins.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.720
If only I weren't gluten intolerant.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.120
She always forgets, doesn't she?

08:50.120 --> 08:51.120
Yes, she sure does.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.840
I keep telling her you like muffins.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.840
That's probably why.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.040
I'll put these with the other batches.

09:03.920 --> 09:13.520
So we see Clark and Gerald walking through the stacks, picking out books, and talking

09:13.520 --> 09:21.640
about life, and then the phone in the contention public library begins to ring.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.640
Ring, ring.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.640
Ring, ring.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.640
Thank you.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.680
I was going to do that in post, but I think we don't need it anymore.

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
No, we're going to keep that.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
No, that's-

09:29.680 --> 09:31.600
And that's going to be the phone sound for the rest of the podcast.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.760
All of the podcasts got that sweet, sweet sample.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
You're welcome.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.560
It will be used from here on out.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
Yes.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.960
Hello, this is Gerald.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.960
Clark, Clark, get Clark.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.960
Hurry.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.960
Who may I ask is speaking?

09:47.960 --> 09:48.960
Tell him.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.000
Tell him he was already given the best letters.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
You have to tell him.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Are we talking about-

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
Excuse me, are you still there?

10:02.440 --> 10:05.320
He put his heart monitor on the line?

10:05.320 --> 10:07.280
How very strange.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.760
Clark, I believe you got a phone call.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.640
He told you you have the best letters.

10:13.640 --> 10:17.640
I've often liked the spelling of your name as well.

10:17.640 --> 10:25.280
What do you think that means?

10:25.280 --> 10:28.560
He sounded panicked, and then he screamed a little.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.800
So you guys look outside the windows to the outside world.

10:32.800 --> 10:41.560
The sun was still out, you know, late summer, and the sky turns, and it is dark before you

10:41.560 --> 10:42.560
know it.

10:42.560 --> 10:47.880
Like, it is not time for sunset, however, the sun is no longer shining over contention.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.800
Oh, that precarious contention weather.

10:50.800 --> 10:56.760
And you immediately see these figures start moving outside the windows, and you can't

10:56.760 --> 11:01.480
make them out, but something is moving around outside the library.

11:01.480 --> 11:07.600
And you kind of look over, and Gary Daley is just, you know, in his book, oh my, yeah.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.000
You kind of look over, and you see the front doors, and you see this dark figure in the

11:13.000 --> 11:16.400
darkness behind him, shrouded.

11:16.400 --> 11:24.000
He's clearly wearing a cloak, and he is locking the doors of the library with a massive chain,

11:24.320 --> 11:27.120
and he's locking you into the library.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.560
As soon as he finishes, he turns and runs, and out of the windows, you see a bright flash

11:31.560 --> 11:32.560
of light.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.340
What do you guys do?

11:35.340 --> 11:37.520
My God, what is happening?

11:37.520 --> 11:40.440
Mr. Finkerson, did you see that?

11:40.440 --> 11:41.960
Well, I sure did.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.320
Let's go take a look.

11:43.320 --> 11:48.280
Seems something's finally interesting is happening in contention.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.560
Interesting is, I guess, one way to put it.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.080
Yes, don't you worry, Clark.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.840
I'm your mentor.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.440
I will take care of this.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.440
Okay.

11:56.440 --> 12:00.440
And I go and stand very behind Mr. Finkerson.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.080
All right, Mr. Finkerson.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.240
All right.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.920
So I go over and take a peek out of one of the windows.

12:07.920 --> 12:08.920
Okay.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.160
When you go over and take a peek out of the windows, I'm picturing...

12:11.160 --> 12:14.720
Oh, also, real quick, what does Mr. Finkerson look like?

12:14.720 --> 12:20.360
He looks like, let me try to think of a celebrity comparison.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.160
Oh, we don't do that.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.280
We don't do that here.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.080
We don't do that here.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.660
That's what all the other actual play podcasts do.

12:29.660 --> 12:36.280
So we'd like to give a quick physical description using two to three descriptive words.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.960
Okay, two to three, that's all I get?

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
Yeah.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.960
Okay.

12:40.960 --> 12:41.960
Sweater vest.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.960
All right, you already used two.

12:44.960 --> 12:53.080
No, that's a hyphenated word, if not just one complete word.

12:53.080 --> 13:02.800
And if I only get one other word, bifocals, I was going to say like low on the bridge

13:02.800 --> 13:03.800
of my nose.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
Okay.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.280
A sweater vest and bifocals that are low on the bridge of my nose.

13:07.280 --> 13:13.560
He's also only 19, it's a weird choice in the voice.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.480
As you look out the window...

13:15.480 --> 13:17.600
Sweater vest but no shirt underneath.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
Oh, that's a good look.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.320
They tat it up.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.040
Tribal tattoos going all the way down.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.040
The glasses aren't even real, they're just like for to be trendy.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.680
Are they transitions?

13:30.680 --> 13:33.200
Oh, of course they are.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.480
So we see, what's your fucking name?

13:36.480 --> 13:37.480
Gerald.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.480
Gerald.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.480
I said it wrong.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.480
Gerald.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.480
Gerald.

13:42.480 --> 13:47.280
So we see Gerald Fingersen looking out, creeping along and looking out this window and a young

13:47.280 --> 13:55.320
Clark kind of peeking out from behind him and this massive, massive shadow moves right

13:55.320 --> 13:59.520
out of frame and you actually see this man.

13:59.520 --> 14:06.940
He's a very tall man wearing a black suit and he is sprinting away and following him

14:06.940 --> 14:15.500
is this completely cloaked figure who is running after him into the darkness of the night.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.720
That's happening outside the windows?

14:16.720 --> 14:17.720
That's happening outside the window.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.560
And it would have previously been like 2pm or something?

14:20.560 --> 14:26.000
It would have previously been like 5.30pm, maybe even 6.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.440
Do I recognize the man in the suit?

14:27.440 --> 14:28.440
No.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.680
Mr. Fingersen, do you know who that was?

14:29.680 --> 14:33.040
I sure don't and there's only a population of...

14:33.040 --> 14:36.000
Insert whatever you think the population of contention is.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.760
I don't think we've ever talked about it.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.600
So let's not.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.200
We might need a whole lot more at some point.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.560
Yeah, probably small.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.200
Okay, how about this?

14:47.200 --> 14:52.200
I do not, however, I only ever interact with people at the library, so it's pretty much

14:52.200 --> 14:55.520
just you and now Mr. Daley.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.520
Just geographically, would that guy have been, should he have been running from the library

15:00.520 --> 15:03.000
or could he have been coming from somewhere else?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Geographically?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Mm-hmm.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.440
Oh, they were coming from the library.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.680
It looks like they ran through the wall and popped out the other side.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.680
No, not quite.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.680
No.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.240
No, they're just running away from the library.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.240
Okay.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.240
But how far would you say they are?

15:17.240 --> 15:18.240
20 yards.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
Okay.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
And then...

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
Take a shot, Mr. Fingersen, take a shot.

15:21.240 --> 15:25.040
I pull out a big rifle.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.040
They aren't even serpentining.

15:29.040 --> 15:33.360
Dear boy, I'd like you to get behind the reference center.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.800
I do believe I'm going to try to interact with them.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.680
And then I go try to open a window.

15:38.680 --> 15:45.920
When you open up the window, light actually comes back into the world and both figures

15:45.920 --> 15:50.440
that you saw running away are no longer within sight.

15:50.440 --> 15:56.160
However, based on how fast they were running and how far away they were and the flatness

15:56.160 --> 16:01.800
of the land, you should still be able to see them, but you no longer can.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.480
Okay, I'm going to go see if the lock is still on the door.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.580
It is.

16:05.580 --> 16:06.640
But it's lighter out now?

16:06.640 --> 16:07.640
Yeah.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.120
It's normal, but there's a lock on the door.

16:09.120 --> 16:16.000
Clark pops his head up from behind the reference desk where he dutifully went and hid and sees

16:16.000 --> 16:17.520
that it's kind of light out.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.400
I want to look at Mr. Daley.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.760
How's he acting?

16:20.760 --> 16:27.600
Mr. Daley is sitting staring at this book and he looks at you and he's like, was there

16:27.600 --> 16:30.940
a big cloud?

16:30.940 --> 16:33.000
Maybe Mr. Daley.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.720
It seemed pretty dark for a cloud though.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.940
That was crazy.

16:35.940 --> 16:41.340
I've read those occult books frontwards and backwards in my many years alone in the library

16:41.340 --> 16:44.420
and I do believe that they have something to do with this.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.340
Mr. Daley, I think we must have a sit and talk.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.180
Okay, come on down.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.180
We go on down.

16:51.180 --> 16:56.660
All right, so we see, give me just a second.

16:56.660 --> 17:05.940
I was going to do the Georgia booboo beep boop booboo.

17:05.940 --> 17:11.400
There was an article that my favorite murder is the most listened to podcast in Missouri.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
Is it really?

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
How interesting.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.840
It's that and cereal and something else that they're all three of the things that my mom

17:16.840 --> 17:17.840
listened to.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.620
She was like, I'm bumping those numbers up, baby.

17:20.620 --> 17:25.700
Well, I've almost finished all of my favorite murder in a short period of time.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.700
They're good.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.300
I've only listened to a handful, but I've always enjoyed them.

17:28.300 --> 17:33.500
All right, well here, I'll show you what I was reading while, uh, when all that went

17:33.500 --> 17:40.580
all dark and stuff, I was, I was looking at this page here, it says, uh, and casting her

17:40.580 --> 17:42.060
eyes aside.

17:42.060 --> 17:45.380
She saw- Mr. Daley, don't say it again.

17:45.380 --> 17:48.900
What if it, what if it was the thing that did the thing and then you did it again?

17:48.900 --> 17:53.300
Well then I guess it would get dark if you believe in that sort of thing, Clark, but

17:53.300 --> 17:57.980
well, you know, you're a young boy, I suppose beliefs aren't that crazy for you.

17:57.980 --> 18:01.900
Clark starts to kind of realize that he's being a little wimp and he's like, no, I mean,

18:01.900 --> 18:03.940
of course, of course that's not what happened.

18:03.940 --> 18:05.940
What are you, a little pussy?

18:05.940 --> 18:06.940
Sorry.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.460
Mr. Daley, do not talk to my son.

18:09.460 --> 18:14.520
I mean my, my friend that way.

18:14.520 --> 18:20.960
And casting her eyes aside, she saw a spirit lift up a cloth over lying over a pot looking

18:20.960 --> 18:26.320
much like a ferret and it being asked of the examiner why the spirit did look upon

18:26.320 --> 18:28.440
her, she said it was hungry.

18:28.440 --> 18:33.160
This examiner being asked how she knew the names of Mother Bennet's spirits saith that

18:33.160 --> 18:38.120
Tiffin, her spirit, did tell this examiner that she had two spirits and one of them was

18:38.120 --> 18:44.680
like a black dog and the other was red like a lion and that their names were Sucken and

18:44.680 --> 18:51.160
cleared and sayeth that Sucken did plague Biet's wife unto death and other plague three

18:51.160 --> 18:54.160
of his beasts where of two of them died.

18:54.160 --> 18:59.160
That voice is incredibly difficult to listen to.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.200
Thankfully it's a small character.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.960
I don't know what any of that means, but it sounded cool.

19:05.960 --> 19:10.280
These spirits of a dog and a lion that made a, I don't think, I don't know if that has

19:10.280 --> 19:12.240
anything to do with this, but that's pretty cool.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.040
Clark is still trying to put on a brave face, but he is definitely peeking out the window

19:16.040 --> 19:19.080
seeing if the sun's blinking out or anything.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.920
Oh yeah, it's completely back to normal outside.

19:22.920 --> 19:23.920
Nothing out of the ordinary.

19:23.920 --> 19:28.880
Perhaps we should bury this deep inside ourselves and never talk about it again until we have

19:28.880 --> 19:29.880
another encounter.

19:29.880 --> 19:43.520
Yeah, I do think that's a real good idea there, Gerald.

19:43.520 --> 19:48.120
Perhaps a formative experience will happen to you that will unveil this again.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.480
Gerald, that's a really good point, Clark.

19:50.480 --> 19:56.640
I think that if you guys think that this is going to, you know, affect me in some way

19:56.640 --> 20:04.080
down the line, then I'm going to trust you older gentlemen.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.080
Thank you for calling me a gentleman.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.080
Same.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.960
I don't know where to go from here.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.600
Yeah, I think we're good in the library.

20:11.600 --> 20:12.600
Cool.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
Yeah, I think that was good.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.600
I love that.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.360
Is that an episode wrap on Taylor?

20:17.360 --> 20:19.920
Well, yes, that is a wrap on Taylor.

20:19.920 --> 20:20.920
You killed it.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.920
I made it.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.920
You fucking killed it.

20:22.920 --> 20:35.620
Joe, when Clark turns the corner onto the street his house is on, his mind begins to

20:35.620 --> 20:37.720
falter.

20:37.720 --> 20:42.640
Your mind effectively breaks, shattering into different realities, and these different scenes

20:42.640 --> 20:47.040
play out in front of you, but they're constantly changing like a television flipping through

20:47.040 --> 20:48.040
the channels.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.000
First, you see your house exactly as you know it.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Then it's on fire.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.520
Next, the house is normal, but there are police officers and vehicles everywhere, and yellow

20:57.520 --> 20:59.840
tape surrounds your home.

20:59.840 --> 21:03.880
One after another, relentlessly, the scene changes around you.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.620
There are a couple black sedans out front.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.360
Now everything is normal again.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.000
Now it's a wasteland.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
Your surroundings continue to vacillate as you approach the door of your home.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.220
A man in a suit hops out of a black sedan and hollers to get your attention as you open

21:18.220 --> 21:19.920
your front door.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.680
Inside is quiet.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.840
Looking down the hallway, you notice something's off.

21:24.840 --> 21:28.920
There are more wall decorations than normal.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.520
Your reality breaks again.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.960
Everything's back to the way it always has been.

21:32.960 --> 21:37.800
You hear the sounds of Wheel of Fortune, but the sound of the wheel spinning just goes

21:37.800 --> 21:43.700
and goes and goes, and you hear voices all around you and inside of you.

21:43.700 --> 21:49.480
One says, well, we couldn't find the artifact, but we'll have to get the fuck out of here

21:49.480 --> 21:53.400
because Karen did her goddamn magic trick again.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.520
Your vision flickers back to your unacceptable reality.

21:57.520 --> 22:03.960
In the hallway, there are not more pictures of a happy family, or of angels' wings, or

22:03.960 --> 22:05.800
of Jesus.

22:05.800 --> 22:10.840
Instead, suspended a couple feet off the ground as if they had been halfway quicksanded into

22:10.840 --> 22:18.760
the wall, the parents of Clark Bishop, your parents, have become interior design.

22:19.440 --> 22:25.480
Their knees jutting out into the hallway, their hands grasping out for life, their faces

22:25.480 --> 22:28.920
contorted in anguish and disbelief.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.800
A voice snaps you out of it.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.460
We the jury, find the defendant and love.

22:35.460 --> 22:42.220
You look up and see a cold, vacant woman smiling out from behind the thick, asymmetrical bangs

22:42.220 --> 22:44.600
covering one of her eyes.

22:44.640 --> 22:49.120
All you can remember about that day is how perfectly normal it all was.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.800
How your house looked completely empty.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.000
They weren't there anymore.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.920
There was very little evidence in the trial, but the words of Anne Love's confession

22:58.920 --> 23:05.200
haunt you as you try desperately to remember anything about that abhorrent day.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.120
I did it, and I'd do it again.

23:14.600 --> 23:26.880
It's X-Files.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.480
It's like D&D, but it's like X-Files.

23:28.480 --> 23:34.160
That's what I have to say to everybody when I describe this game.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.920
I never think to use the X-Files analogy.

23:35.920 --> 23:36.920
That's what I always say.

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
It's good.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.040
Luke got it from me.

23:39.320 --> 23:43.960
Speaking of the X-Files.

23:43.960 --> 23:49.640
I always say that it's like true detective, but stupid.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.640
Yeah.

23:50.640 --> 23:51.640
That's awesome.

23:51.640 --> 23:57.400
Wow, it literally sounded like you had a mouthful of vomit or something.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.400
Dick.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.000
Dude, I wish I had a mouthful of dick right now.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.760
Dude, does anybody bring in any dicks to suck this weekend?

24:05.760 --> 24:06.760
I think.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.720
I think we're gonna suck Alex's dick all weekend.

24:08.720 --> 24:14.480
Dude, honestly, I think if we're ever gonna get involved in a once in a lifetime gay orgy,

24:14.480 --> 24:15.480
it's this weekend.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.480
It's gonna be this weekend.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.480
12 dudes.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.320
And a lot of them are strangers to me, so I won't feel that embarrassed.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.520
I'll never see them again.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.520
And it ticks a few boxes.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.040
And Alex is leading the party.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.240
He's so drunk that he's not verbal again.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.940
Alex would never do something like sleep with a stripper at his bachelor party.

24:31.940 --> 24:36.440
His last hurrah of being single would be fucking 12 dudes.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.440
11.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.440
11.

24:38.440 --> 24:42.720
Dude, it's gonna be fun and I hope that we all make it.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.200
Yeah, I hope none of us drown in Lake of the Ozarks.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.200
Yeah, we get arrested.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.520
Or, yeah, I hope none of us get dragged by a cop underwater.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.200
They slap cuffs on us and throw us in the water.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.200
Oops.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.800
Did that guy get fired?

24:58.800 --> 25:00.280
You have the right to remain splashed.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.920
No, like, nothing happened to that cop, right?

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Nothing happened to that cop.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.200
I didn't know this was a real thing.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.040
They handcuffed a guy in a lake and he couldn't swim?

25:06.040 --> 25:09.680
No, they handcuffed a guy, sat him on the side of the boat, and he fell backwards and

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
drowned.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.680
Nobody got him.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
Holy shit.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.680
Holy shit.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.680
Yeah, dude.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.680
That's a big ol' oopsie.

25:15.680 --> 25:20.040
I don't think the cops got disciplined, but the family is suing the fuck out of the city,

25:20.040 --> 25:21.040
I'm pretty sure.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
I mean, it's Keith's shit.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.040
Like, straight up.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
Straight up.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.040
Hard.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.040
That's us.

25:26.040 --> 25:30.320
I want to say that he actually got charged with involuntary manslaughter or something.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.320
Was it here?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.320
Was it at Lake of the Ozarks?

25:32.320 --> 25:33.320
Well, that's just a ticket in Missouri.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.440
Yeah, that's not us.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.440
Yeah.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.440
50 bucks.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.440
Duly noted.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.640
I didn't mean to accidentally kill him.

25:41.640 --> 25:45.880
Okay, give me one more puff and then I'm ready to boot this baby up and start playing my

25:45.880 --> 25:46.880
Bean Boy.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.440
You ready to boot-skootin' Biggie?

25:48.440 --> 25:50.640
Also, I think we're going to...

25:50.640 --> 25:51.640
Well, I'm good.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.360
Okay, one last puff.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.360
Can you do it?

25:54.360 --> 25:55.360
Oh my god.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.360
That's your third last puff.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
I know.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.280
Okay, so Agent Kennedy looks at you guys and she says,

26:01.280 --> 26:04.280
Good luck.

26:04.280 --> 26:09.180
And Kennedy and Billy Harrison turn around and walk out of the police station.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.180
Before they do that...

26:10.180 --> 26:12.960
I think they already did, though, in the last one.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.960
They did, yeah.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.220
Yeah, that was just, like, getting us back in.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.220
Well, shit.

26:17.220 --> 26:20.320
I mean, I don't think we just let him leave, though.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.460
I'd be like, wait, what the fuck?

26:21.460 --> 26:22.460
What is this number?

26:22.460 --> 26:23.460
Who are you?

26:23.460 --> 26:24.460
What are you talking about?

26:24.460 --> 26:27.040
Please fill us in.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.600
We're in what?

26:29.600 --> 26:31.360
Should we just call the number right now?

26:31.360 --> 26:32.960
None of this is helpful so far.

26:32.960 --> 26:37.800
You've just added more mystery to our, like, horribly chaotic lives.

26:37.800 --> 26:45.360
Yeah, how about you're too stunned by the recent revelations that have been brought

26:45.360 --> 26:47.880
to your attention to say anything.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.680
Well, but the only revelation brought to our attention is that there was a phone number.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.960
She also confirmed that weird shit exists.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.840
Yeah, weird shit is happening, but...

26:56.840 --> 26:58.920
Yeah, like, super weird shit.

26:58.920 --> 27:05.300
Like she is letting you hold onto a Nike bag that makes things disappear, and she was desperately

27:05.300 --> 27:11.120
trying to get rid of a small silver sphere, and Billy Harrison, the bald guy from Charles

27:11.120 --> 27:16.560
Donovan's trunk, is one of them, and, okay, how about this.

27:16.560 --> 27:26.200
On the back of the paper with the phone number, it says, your job is to stop the incursion,

27:26.200 --> 27:32.300
minimize exposure, save lives, and cover the whole thing up.

27:32.300 --> 27:37.720
But the ink disappears after you read it, and on the other side, the phone number is

27:37.720 --> 27:38.720
still there.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.520
Okay, so you guys were talking at the end, and maybe I just missed this in the game.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.760
Did you really say call this number in 48 hours?

27:44.760 --> 27:45.760
With in.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
With in, yeah.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.760
Oh, with in.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.080
They are gonna call us in 48 hours if we don't.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.080
If we don't call them first.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.080
Gotcha.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.040
I thought it was call when you've completed.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.160
That also.

27:54.160 --> 27:58.640
Our job is to stop the incursion, minimize exposure, save lives, and cover the whole

27:58.640 --> 28:01.080
thing up to save it from being exposed.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.820
Cool, I'm glad you wrote that down.

28:03.820 --> 28:07.320
Quick question, is there, when we spend luck, is there any way to get it back, or is this

28:07.320 --> 28:08.760
just like our bank?

28:08.760 --> 28:13.520
There is a way to get it back, and also, I haven't awarded any of you luck.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.720
Have any of us used luck at all?

28:15.720 --> 28:17.040
None of you have used.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.520
I thought you did once.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
No, no one.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.760
I didn't, because I'm still at 60.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.000
No one has used any luck so far.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.760
We've rolled on it before, but we haven't spent any for it.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
Exactly.

28:26.760 --> 28:32.480
And so, let's go ahead and change the economy of luck at the beginning of this session.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.640
I will award you all five luck.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.640
Right now?

28:36.640 --> 28:37.640
Yes, right now.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.520
You all gain five luck.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.520
I'm at 65.

28:42.920 --> 28:46.600
That's four away from the cool number.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.760
And only a math problem away from 420.

28:48.760 --> 28:52.440
Yeah, I was trying to do that in my head when you made that joke.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.320
Scott Aukerman wouldn't have it like that.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.140
Rob Crockleman.

28:57.140 --> 29:00.880
Is that even one, or did you just say syllables and ended it at three?

29:00.880 --> 29:01.880
Harg-Barkerman.

29:01.880 --> 29:02.880
I said Op-Crockleman.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.880
That's not one.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.880
No.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.880
Nice.

29:07.440 --> 29:13.820
So I'm rewarding you this luck for making it this far, I guess, in the plot and also

29:13.820 --> 29:15.560
doing the cool stuff you do.

29:15.560 --> 29:22.840
Now from here on out, I will say, if I don't award you luck, if you do something cool and

29:22.840 --> 29:27.100
you think that you deserve luck, go ahead and call me out and be like, can I get some

29:27.100 --> 29:28.100
luck for that?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.400
Like a waiter demanding a tip.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.400
Exactly.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.640
Yeah, I did a really good job tonight.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.480
I know there's only two of you, but I'm doing automatic gratuity.

29:37.480 --> 29:44.320
20% is generous and customary, but I really think this was more of a 35 night.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.600
I kind of knocked it out of the park with y'all.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.400
Yeah, so that's allowed.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.400
And also...

29:50.400 --> 29:51.960
Okay, I think I deserve more luck.

29:51.960 --> 29:52.960
Yeah, me too.

29:52.960 --> 29:53.960
You don't.

29:53.960 --> 29:57.500
I think I would have had a stronger case.

29:57.500 --> 30:01.140
So from here on out, let's go ahead and do that.

30:01.140 --> 30:06.660
And hopefully the luck economy can start changing more throughout.

30:06.660 --> 30:12.980
I'm hoping not only will I try to put you in situations where maybe luck is more necessary,

30:12.980 --> 30:15.660
that's just going to happen based on the story that we're playing.

30:15.660 --> 30:20.680
And also keep doing cool stuff, keep role playing well, and you'll gain more luck.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.340
Can we speculate and trade luck?

30:22.340 --> 30:23.340
No.

30:23.340 --> 30:24.340
Okay, well...

30:24.340 --> 30:25.340
I'm going to short luck, Joe.

30:25.340 --> 30:27.740
So it's not really an economy.

30:27.740 --> 30:31.080
I think you're going to get luck tonight, okay?

30:31.080 --> 30:33.840
I bet you 50 luck you get luck tonight.

30:33.840 --> 30:39.080
But yeah, I bet you 10% of that luck that you will get luck.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.080
I don't understand it.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.080
So...

30:41.080 --> 30:42.080
Why would he make that bet?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.080
Yeah, like I give you luck if I'm lucky?

30:44.080 --> 30:49.280
Yeah, and if you're not, then I give you a little bit of luck and you get some anyway.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.180
Let's think about this later.

30:51.180 --> 30:53.040
I have no idea where to start.

30:53.060 --> 30:57.960
So we're all sitting, we're literally standing there in a stunned silence, and then we would

30:57.960 --> 31:03.580
probably reiterate, so uh, what do you feel this like, that old man, that the world isn't

31:03.580 --> 31:04.580
as we know it?

31:04.580 --> 31:08.320
Probably got something to do with all the shit that we've seen recently.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.660
She was talking about saving humanity, like that's some heavy shit.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.660
That's super hero shit.

31:12.660 --> 31:14.780
Isn't that why we became police officers?

31:14.780 --> 31:16.600
To save humanity.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.580
Why did you become a police officer, Keith?

31:19.580 --> 31:22.940
Well, it seemed easy, and so far it's been pretty easy.

31:26.820 --> 31:27.820
So the...

31:27.820 --> 31:29.620
They didn't trust me to be a doctor.

31:29.620 --> 31:34.060
The thing that I've devoted my life to, you got into because it was easy?

31:34.060 --> 31:35.580
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

31:35.580 --> 31:36.580
Oh Keith.

31:36.580 --> 31:44.900
I mean, I graduated, well, I wasn't the, I was in the class, yeah, I graduated at the,

31:44.900 --> 31:45.900
in the class.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.020
I wasn't the top of my class, but...

31:48.020 --> 31:49.020
Well that's something.

31:49.460 --> 31:51.940
Yeah, I graduated from the police academy.

31:51.940 --> 31:56.780
I also love the movie police academy, that's one reason, cause I was hoping that I'd work

31:56.780 --> 31:59.520
with somebody that could make cool noises.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.820
What if you tried to bring that to the table yourself?

32:01.820 --> 32:02.820
No, I'm not very good at it.

32:02.820 --> 32:03.820
You could be the cool noises guy.

32:03.820 --> 32:04.820
I don't really have any skills.

32:04.820 --> 32:05.820
Try a helicopter.

32:05.820 --> 32:06.820
That's it, Landy.

32:06.820 --> 32:07.820
Just keep working.

32:07.820 --> 32:08.820
Um, no.

32:08.820 --> 32:09.820
Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.

32:09.820 --> 32:10.820
Oh yeah, it's been super easy.

32:10.820 --> 32:11.820
It's been super easy.

32:11.820 --> 32:12.820
It's been super easy.

32:12.820 --> 32:13.820
It's been super easy.

32:13.820 --> 32:14.820
It's been super easy.

32:14.820 --> 32:15.820
It's been super easy.

32:15.820 --> 32:18.420
Anyway, yeah, it's been super easy.

32:18.420 --> 32:20.620
Oh yeah, the Delta...

32:20.620 --> 32:23.620
Uh, fuck.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.620
The mysterious organization.

32:26.620 --> 32:29.620
So do you think we're dealing with some like X-Files type...

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
I'd say exactly like X-Files.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.620
What's X-Files?

32:33.620 --> 32:36.620
No, Clark would definitely know what X-Files is.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.620
Like, like a fictionalized ancient aliens?

32:39.620 --> 32:44.820
Okay, so we, we have no information about what she just said, but I feel like it makes

32:44.820 --> 32:45.820
sense.

32:45.820 --> 32:47.220
She asked us to stop the incursion.

32:47.220 --> 32:50.820
Do you think the incursion could be that black oily goo we've been seeing?

32:50.820 --> 32:51.820
It seems like exactly...

32:51.820 --> 32:52.820
That could be it.

32:52.820 --> 32:54.820
Yeah, that's, that seems like the incursion to me.

32:54.820 --> 32:55.820
How do we stop it though?

32:55.820 --> 32:56.820
We get a...

32:56.820 --> 33:01.420
Dude, we should find out what this bag is made out of and make a big, big one and just

33:01.420 --> 33:02.420
put it...

33:02.420 --> 33:03.420
Over the town.

33:03.420 --> 33:04.420
Over the town.

33:04.420 --> 33:05.420
Like a dome.

33:05.420 --> 33:06.420
Well, uh...

33:06.420 --> 33:07.780
Like the Simpsons movie.

33:07.780 --> 33:12.220
Me and John ran into this guy yesterday who was sucking it up in a vacuum and it seemed

33:12.220 --> 33:14.100
to be working for a while there.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.100
And yeah, it, it just worked.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.100
Like a drive-back?

33:17.100 --> 33:18.100
Yeah.

33:18.100 --> 33:21.220
It kind of looked like just a hoo, it was, did it look like a Hoover?

33:21.220 --> 33:22.220
I think you described it.

33:22.220 --> 33:23.220
Like a wet-vac?

33:23.220 --> 33:24.220
H-vac?

33:24.220 --> 33:29.500
It was a, like a, yeah, like just a normal upright vacuum with a bag.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.260
Yeah, it just looked like a normal upright vacuum with a bag.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.200
It also had a hose, like a wand.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.300
Should we put an alert out for all citizens to be at the ready?

33:37.300 --> 33:39.940
Well, what about those gather their vacuums?

33:39.940 --> 33:43.100
Didn't they mention something about a couple of kids missing?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.100
I think that was unrelated.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.100
Yeah, I don't know about that.

33:45.100 --> 33:46.100
We were in the area.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.100
Yeah, that's...

33:47.100 --> 33:48.100
Was that not kind of where you guys were?

33:48.100 --> 33:51.180
No, we'll probably have to investigate that when we get finished with all this stuff.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.180
Okay, yeah.

33:52.180 --> 33:53.180
They probably just ran away.

33:53.180 --> 33:58.140
I know that we just got a lot of weird shit thrown at us, but we were going to go check

33:58.140 --> 34:01.140
out the mill before, you know, the whole house explosion.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.100
That can definitely be our next step.

34:03.100 --> 34:07.460
Wait, weren't we all going to split up and go to, we had three different places we were

34:07.460 --> 34:08.460
going to go to.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.460
Yeah, at the end.

34:09.460 --> 34:10.460
It was the mill?

34:10.460 --> 34:11.460
We talked about that.

34:11.460 --> 34:12.460
What was the other two places?

34:12.820 --> 34:14.420
The mill, the church, because the church has a helmet.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.620
The third place was investigating the chief's father, but that's the mill.

34:17.620 --> 34:22.280
So he worked at the mill, so, okay, so we need to check out the helmet at the church

34:22.280 --> 34:24.860
and the mill and the chief's father.

34:24.860 --> 34:27.800
I feel like there was a third, a real third, third thing.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.180
Were there any property crimes we needed to investigate?

34:31.180 --> 34:34.380
Like any break-ins, random home?

34:34.380 --> 34:35.380
What about the trashings?

34:35.380 --> 34:39.420
Well, no, the hospital burnt down, but there's some of the hospital burnt.

34:39.460 --> 34:40.460
Yeah, the hospital burnt down.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.460
It's...

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
But we weren't going to do that.

34:43.460 --> 34:49.780
While you guys are talking, you hear Drew's phone start ringing and he picks it up.

34:49.780 --> 34:54.980
Drew, Andrew, Contingent Police Department, can you hold for a moment of silence for our

34:54.980 --> 34:55.980
chief?

34:55.980 --> 34:58.100
Oh, you have what?

34:58.100 --> 34:59.100
Okay.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.100
Okay.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.100
Yeah.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.100
I'll send them right over.

35:02.100 --> 35:09.380
Uh, hey, officers, Gary Daley has information about the chief's house blowing up.

35:09.380 --> 35:14.820
You guys would know that Gary Daley is the longtime partner of Harry Klinker and he's

35:14.820 --> 35:20.000
also the owner operator of The Daily Pho.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
The Daily Pho?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
The Daily Pho?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.980
Is that like a Korean or a Vietnamese newspaper?

35:25.980 --> 35:34.660
Uh, no, it is a, uh, is The Daily Pho spelled D-A-L-Y, as in Gary Daley, and it is a pho

35:34.660 --> 35:38.780
restaurant located in the northeast corner of downtown Contingent.

35:38.780 --> 35:41.220
You'd know this place has been around for generations.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.220
Damn.

35:42.220 --> 35:43.220
Okay.

35:43.220 --> 35:46.060
Let's, uh, I think we should not split up as long as possible.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.060
Not yet.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.060
No, yeah.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.060
I still want you guys in here.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.060
Yeah.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.900
I'm kind of a lone wolf, but I'll stick with you guys for now.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.300
We're going to head over to Gary.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.300
Gary's.

35:54.300 --> 35:55.300
Okay.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.300
Yeah.

35:56.300 --> 36:01.180
He's at his place of business in northeast downtown is where The Daily Pho sits.

36:01.180 --> 36:05.780
When you guys walk in, there are lots of pictures hanging on the walls of the history of this

36:05.780 --> 36:12.060
restaurant, including one very large picture of four generations of Daley's, a young Gary

36:12.060 --> 36:16.020
Daley, his mother, grandmother, and great grandfather.

36:16.020 --> 36:20.460
They had all owned and operated this restaurant at one time or another.

36:20.460 --> 36:25.700
There are also a bunch of prints with black and white designs on them.

36:25.700 --> 36:29.880
One is a circle with a star inside of it.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.860
Inside that star is another star, and there are a couple of triangles, curved lines and

36:34.940 --> 36:37.080
tiny circles as well.

36:37.080 --> 36:42.380
Another is a tree branch with three twigs growing on one side and two twigs growing

36:42.380 --> 36:43.960
on the other.

36:43.960 --> 36:49.340
Another print is a black circle with six black dots surrounding it.

36:49.340 --> 36:55.700
Another is a wonky question mark with lines, one curved and one straight jutting down from

36:55.700 --> 36:57.780
the question marks dot.

36:57.780 --> 37:04.100
And behind the counter comes walking an older man, but he dresses very hip.

37:04.100 --> 37:09.560
He's wearing jeans cuffed halfway up his calves and a nice short-sleeve button down with tiny

37:09.560 --> 37:12.540
cartoon bean sprouts printed all over it.

37:12.540 --> 37:20.900
He walks up to you and immediately says, do you guys remember, you guys, hey officers,

37:20.900 --> 37:26.660
hey, do you guys remember when I would help watch you down at clinkers when you were but

37:26.660 --> 37:29.300
wee little fellas?

37:29.300 --> 37:30.300
Sure do.

37:30.300 --> 37:31.300
Absolutely, yeah.

37:31.300 --> 37:32.300
Good to see you again.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.300
Thanks.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.900
All right, come on, come on back, come on back here.

37:36.900 --> 37:41.320
And he, uh, and he starts walking back to a little office in the, in the back of the

37:41.320 --> 37:42.320
daily pho.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.620
Real quick, the symbols on the wall, were they like framed photos?

37:45.620 --> 37:46.620
How what were they?

37:46.620 --> 37:47.620
They're prints, right?

37:47.620 --> 37:48.620
They're prints.

37:48.620 --> 37:49.620
Okay.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.620
Yeah.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.620
So they were like, like on paper, just yeah, they were just framed prints.

37:51.620 --> 37:52.620
Okay.

37:52.620 --> 37:53.620
Pretty artsy.

37:53.620 --> 37:54.620
Cool.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.620
We're back in the office at this point.

37:55.620 --> 37:59.520
I do want to have a room in my house someday where I've just got a bunch of fucking pictures

37:59.520 --> 38:00.520
of prints.

38:00.740 --> 38:05.240
And I'm like, Hey, do you guys want to come see all my, my framed prints?

38:05.240 --> 38:06.240
Nice.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.240
Okay.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.240
So we're in his office, his office.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.240
Yeah.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.960
And he sits down behind a small desk.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.120
I, there's a tiny desk on three.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.120
Yes.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.120
He begins singing for you.

38:18.120 --> 38:21.600
Uh, what a beautiful lullaby Gary.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.720
Just like it's like he used to sing to everybody.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
Come on down.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.620
We're at the daily fall.

38:28.620 --> 38:31.420
You got to get your fall.

38:31.420 --> 38:36.980
And um, I remember those commercials and didn't run too long.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.740
So thanks for calling Gary.

38:38.740 --> 38:44.260
There's a, there's in the office, there's one chair on the other side of the desk.

38:44.260 --> 38:47.500
So I don't know if somebody wants to sit down or if you guys are all standing.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.500
My feet hurt.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.500
So I'm going to sit down.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.500
I stay standing.

38:50.500 --> 38:51.500
Yeah.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.500
John says, okay.

38:52.500 --> 39:00.020
He says, uh, so it's, uh, it's kind of an embarrassing story, but, uh, I, I heard that

39:00.020 --> 39:05.660
all, uh, Harold Dorsey was in town from the city and you know, he's got a pretty popular

39:05.660 --> 39:10.780
blog these days and I wanted him to write a blog post about the daily fuss.

39:10.780 --> 39:17.400
So I wasn't, I wouldn't call it stalking, but I was kind of following him around town

39:17.400 --> 39:19.740
when I realized where he was.

39:19.740 --> 39:25.020
And uh, I followed him over to the, to the chief's house.

39:25.020 --> 39:32.460
Uh, didn't realize it was, it was that house at the time, but, uh, we saw, uh, I, I guess

39:32.460 --> 39:40.540
I was watching him watch, uh, the, there's a, the chief's car pulled up and the chief

39:40.540 --> 39:46.260
and uh, James, you know, James and uh, another guy got out.

39:46.260 --> 39:47.260
I'm sorry.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.260
I'm sorry.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.260
James.

39:49.780 --> 39:50.780
He's a mononym.

39:50.780 --> 39:51.780
Yeah.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.060
He's just James.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.060
He works at the mill.

39:54.060 --> 39:56.180
He lives over in the suburbs.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.180
You guys don't know James.

39:57.180 --> 39:58.440
He's a cool guy.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.440
He was a cool guy.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.440
Right.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.440
What do you, what do you mean?

40:01.440 --> 40:03.780
We don't talk about ongoing investigation.

40:03.780 --> 40:05.700
Just go ahead and finish your story.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.340
Then we'll forget about it.

40:07.340 --> 40:08.340
Okay.

40:08.340 --> 40:13.260
Well, uh, yeah, no, we saw the, uh, that other guy, I didn't recognize him, but he had the

40:13.260 --> 40:18.860
chief and uh, and James at gunpoint and he was walking him into the house.

40:18.860 --> 40:20.580
I thought that was really scary.

40:20.580 --> 40:27.140
But then, you know, Dorsey, Dorsey left pretty quickly and I kept following him cause I wanted

40:27.140 --> 40:29.180
that blog written.

40:29.180 --> 40:34.380
And so he went to the police department and then I guess he went and picked up Drew and

40:34.380 --> 40:39.980
they, they went back to the chief's house and so Drew was with him the second time.

40:39.980 --> 40:40.980
That's his name, right?

40:40.980 --> 40:44.860
The guy, your little fellow who works down there, he's Drew.

40:44.860 --> 40:45.860
Cool.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.860
Yeah.

40:46.860 --> 40:47.860
Hey Gary.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.740
So at gunpoint, how did chief look?

40:49.740 --> 40:51.020
Did she, did she look scared?

40:51.020 --> 40:53.300
Did she look like she'd been hurt previously?

40:53.300 --> 41:00.420
I didn't really get a great view of it honestly, but uh, yeah, I mean, you know, she, she didn't

41:00.420 --> 41:01.660
look herself.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.660
That's for sure.

41:02.660 --> 41:08.300
You know, she, she wasn't, she wasn't standing tall and proud like, like chief cook would,

41:08.300 --> 41:09.300
you know?

41:09.300 --> 41:13.760
Yeah, no, her and James got walked in there and you know, I was pretty scared, but I wanted

41:13.760 --> 41:16.140
to follow Dorsey and see where he went next.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.140
You know?

41:17.420 --> 41:21.380
He followed him instead of calling in to the police.

41:21.380 --> 41:23.980
Well he was going, I mean, he was going to the police.

41:23.980 --> 41:27.380
I guess I didn't know that at the time, but I was pretty flustered, you know, it was a

41:27.380 --> 41:28.380
crazy situation.

41:28.380 --> 41:33.060
Gary, I've known you for a long time, man, you know I love you, but you had to have made

41:33.060 --> 41:34.060
that call, man.

41:34.060 --> 41:35.060
I'm sorry.

41:35.060 --> 41:39.980
You know, the past is the past though and we got to move forward.

41:39.980 --> 41:46.420
It just seems like maybe, obviously you're not directly responsible for anyone's demise,

41:46.420 --> 41:50.140
but John Lee Pettymore has definitely seen it that way.

41:50.140 --> 41:55.060
I mean, he looks really sad when you question him on it and he's like, I know, I'm sorry.

41:55.060 --> 41:59.860
I mean, I certainly didn't expect the chief's house to up and explode on us.

41:59.860 --> 42:02.900
That's certainly not what I expected to be the next course of action.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.500
But you saw a person held at gunpoint.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.820
That's not, you don't see that every day.

42:07.820 --> 42:10.660
That's you got to say something when you see something.

42:10.660 --> 42:11.880
I was scared.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.780
Can you, can you give me a description of that other guy?

42:14.780 --> 42:15.780
Which one?

42:16.140 --> 42:17.140
The one that held him at gunpoint?

42:17.140 --> 42:20.780
I mean, he was just a guy, you know, he was wearing all black.

42:20.780 --> 42:22.300
I couldn't really get much on him.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.780
I didn't recognize him, but was he, was he fat?

42:24.780 --> 42:25.780
No, he was pretty fat.

42:25.780 --> 42:26.780
Wait, I have a question.

42:26.780 --> 42:31.940
Did we ever send, did we ever get any like of the dental record stuff figured out?

42:31.940 --> 42:33.100
Did we send that off?

42:33.100 --> 42:36.140
That was, I think our third thing we were going to try and that's what I was just thinking.

42:36.140 --> 42:37.140
Okay.

42:37.140 --> 42:40.100
And then you also, you mentioned Harold had a, had a blog.

42:40.100 --> 42:44.220
Do you remember the name of that blog or the address for it?

42:44.660 --> 42:49.700
Well, when you look up Harold Dorsey, you know, you, you'll find his blog.

42:49.700 --> 42:53.480
I think it's called, uh, what's behind Dorsey BAM.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.760
That's it.

42:55.760 --> 43:00.880
It's called what's behind dorsey.com dot blog, spot.com.

43:00.880 --> 43:05.700
So is Dorsey spelled like his name or like Dorsey name D O R S C Y.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.700
Yeah, that guy's super duper clever.

43:07.700 --> 43:09.060
I wish I could be like him.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.060
Yeah.

43:10.060 --> 43:12.020
He's a, he's real smart.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.020
He was.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.260
He's also a great writer.

43:14.260 --> 43:17.420
I mean, he worked in the city for a long time.

43:17.420 --> 43:21.220
So did you follow, you followed him to the police station and then you followed them

43:21.220 --> 43:22.220
back to the house?

43:22.220 --> 43:23.220
Yeah.

43:23.220 --> 43:24.220
And then what?

43:24.220 --> 43:27.580
Well, they went in there and I, I hung out for a little while, but then it got late and

43:27.580 --> 43:29.080
I had to go help close.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.980
So I just left and uh, came back here.

43:31.980 --> 43:33.980
Could you guess how long you waited?

43:33.980 --> 43:34.980
How long they were in there?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.660
Oh, I only waited like 15 minutes.

43:36.660 --> 43:41.060
I wasn't, you know, I wanted, you know, him to write something, but I figured I could

43:41.060 --> 43:43.300
always, you know, catch him the next day.

43:43.300 --> 43:46.540
Maybe if he stayed in town, it was pretty late already at that point.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.420
So I figured he was going to stick around.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.580
About what time was that?

43:49.580 --> 43:50.580
I don't know.

43:50.580 --> 43:53.060
It was around 1am maybe.

43:53.060 --> 43:54.060
I don't know.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.060
Okay.

43:55.060 --> 43:56.620
No, it was later than that.

43:56.620 --> 44:00.500
Now I can't remember, but they were having some trouble closing down here.

44:00.500 --> 44:04.020
And so it was, it was around insert time.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.340
Yeah, no joke.

44:06.340 --> 44:08.140
Uh, wait, what time did I get there?

44:08.140 --> 44:09.140
Like two.

44:09.140 --> 44:10.700
That's why he's having trouble placing it.

44:10.700 --> 44:14.780
I think it was like around two o'clock, but I don't because our stakeout was at one o'clock.

44:14.780 --> 44:18.060
I was there from one 30 to one 45 am.

44:18.060 --> 44:19.060
Exactly.

44:19.060 --> 44:20.060
Thank you.

44:20.060 --> 44:21.060
Thank you, Gary.

44:21.060 --> 44:23.420
I time myself in all my endeavors.

44:23.420 --> 44:26.380
So they pulled up in Maggie's car, all of all three of them.

44:26.380 --> 44:27.700
Yeah, I think so.

44:27.700 --> 44:28.700
Who was driving?

44:28.700 --> 44:31.900
I think it was, I think it was the chief and they were in her cruiser.

44:31.900 --> 44:32.900
Yeah.

44:32.900 --> 44:33.900
Well they were in her.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.380
Uh, yeah, they were in her car, her police cruiser.

44:36.380 --> 44:37.660
Is that what you said?

44:37.660 --> 44:38.660
Yeah.

44:38.660 --> 44:39.660
Is there something?

44:39.660 --> 44:42.820
This is Joe asking you guys, is there a better question we can ask to get more information

44:42.820 --> 44:43.820
about the gunman?

44:43.820 --> 44:44.820
I don't know.

44:44.820 --> 44:47.900
I was trying to lead him with the fat and I was going to keep going, but all I remember

44:47.900 --> 44:49.500
was he was fat and dead.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.940
I mean, we were assuming it's the guy at the table.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.020
I, yeah, I don't.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.900
I just wondered if there was a way we could get even more because the guy at the table

44:55.900 --> 44:59.740
was the one eating Maggie's foot and his, was it his, it was his own foot that was cut

44:59.740 --> 45:00.740
off.

45:00.740 --> 45:01.740
Right?

45:01.740 --> 45:02.740
You, you have no idea.

45:02.740 --> 45:03.740
I mean, he was missing a foot.

45:03.740 --> 45:04.740
His foot was missing.

45:04.740 --> 45:08.380
Her foot was missing and there are two feet in the, yeah, so I figured we can't jump to

45:08.380 --> 45:09.380
any conclusions.

45:09.380 --> 45:12.220
It's a good pun.

45:12.220 --> 45:13.220
Two people can't.

45:13.220 --> 45:18.340
Did the, did the gunman have any like tattoos or scars?

45:18.340 --> 45:22.300
Oh yeah, he had a big scar.

45:22.300 --> 45:24.420
He's all covered up by a giant tattoo.

45:24.420 --> 45:25.500
His whole face was missing.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.500
His whole face was scarred up.

45:26.500 --> 45:31.100
Across his forehead it said Jerry, Jerry Pinkerton.

45:31.100 --> 45:34.820
His whole face was scarred up.

45:34.820 --> 45:35.820
Was it?

45:35.820 --> 45:36.820
Oh yeah.

45:36.820 --> 45:37.820
Yeah, no, actually he did.

45:38.260 --> 45:40.580
He had a pretty big scar over, over one eye.

45:40.580 --> 45:41.580
How about that?

45:41.580 --> 45:46.140
That seems like a prominent feature that could help you.

45:46.140 --> 45:51.980
Keith is trying to remember super hard whether or not the guy at the table had a scar over

45:51.980 --> 45:52.980
his eye.

45:52.980 --> 45:55.340
You would remember that he was not overweight.

45:55.340 --> 45:56.340
He was not overweight.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.540
Oh, that's the one thing I thought I knew.

45:58.540 --> 45:59.540
I thought he was.

45:59.540 --> 46:00.540
I thought he was a fat guy.

46:00.540 --> 46:05.860
The one descriptor I think that was used to describe the guy hunched over was he was unkempt.

46:05.860 --> 46:06.860
Fuck.

46:06.900 --> 46:07.900
Unkempt.

46:07.900 --> 46:08.900
Yeah.

46:08.900 --> 46:09.900
Unkempt.

46:09.900 --> 46:12.060
So this guy was fat and had a scar on his eye.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.060
Yeah.

46:13.060 --> 46:14.060
Was he tall or short?

46:14.060 --> 46:15.060
He was kind of shortish.

46:15.060 --> 46:19.140
Okay, so short, overweight, had a scar on his, which eye?

46:19.140 --> 46:21.580
The one on my side.

46:21.580 --> 46:22.580
So the right?

46:22.580 --> 46:23.580
Sure.

46:23.580 --> 46:28.460
So how many people did you, you saw, he saw him taking Maggie and who at gunpoint?

46:28.460 --> 46:29.460
James.

46:29.460 --> 46:30.460
Oh yeah.

46:30.460 --> 46:31.820
The mononym to James.

46:31.820 --> 46:32.820
So was-

46:32.820 --> 46:33.820
He's a crazy fella.

46:33.820 --> 46:39.340
He was wearing all sorts of, he was wearing one of those white over, over, what are they

46:39.340 --> 46:40.340
called?

46:40.340 --> 46:43.020
It's the stuff that you wear when you don't want stuff on your clothes.

46:43.020 --> 46:44.020
Overall?

46:44.020 --> 46:45.020
Coveralls.

46:45.020 --> 46:46.620
James was wearing white coveralls.

46:46.620 --> 46:47.620
Yeah.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.620
Um.

46:48.620 --> 46:50.940
And then, so was Dorsey already in the house?

46:50.940 --> 46:51.940
I guess.

46:51.940 --> 46:52.940
I don't know.

46:52.940 --> 46:53.940
You were following him though.

46:53.940 --> 46:54.940
Oh yeah.

46:54.940 --> 46:55.940
No, they weren't in the house yet.

46:55.940 --> 46:56.940
No.

46:56.940 --> 46:59.420
When we saw those people, Dorsey was just watching as well.

46:59.420 --> 47:01.280
That's before he went to the police station.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.920
So Dorsey was not in the house before he went to the police station?

47:04.920 --> 47:05.920
Correct.

47:05.920 --> 47:07.120
Does Clark know James?

47:07.120 --> 47:08.120
Uh, no.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.120
Can you tell me more about James?

47:09.120 --> 47:10.120
What'd he look like?

47:10.120 --> 47:14.860
Oh he had like, his hair was going all over the place and he was wearing those white coveralls.

47:14.860 --> 47:18.960
You seem to know a lot about him though, do you know if he and the chief were friends?

47:18.960 --> 47:20.760
I never saw him together.

47:20.760 --> 47:26.520
Uh, James, he moved to town not that long ago and well, it was probably a couple years

47:26.520 --> 47:31.120
ago but that's, you know, pretty new kid in town for around here in contention.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.880
How old of a guy is he?

47:32.880 --> 47:33.880
James?

47:33.880 --> 47:34.880
Yeah.

47:34.880 --> 47:35.880
Well I don't know, he's middle aged or so.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.280
Maybe a little younger.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.360
Very helpful, Gary.

47:38.360 --> 47:41.040
He's a little younger than middle aged.

47:41.040 --> 47:42.720
38.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.720
Seems right.

47:43.720 --> 47:50.240
Gary, not to digress, what, those prints you have in your restaurant, do those have

47:50.240 --> 47:51.640
any special meaning to you?

47:51.640 --> 47:58.400
Are you, I mean, I, yeah, they're fun, I mean, you know, I'm really into like magics and

47:58.400 --> 48:02.200
stuff like left hand, right hand path stuff, so.

48:02.200 --> 48:03.200
Magic stuff?

48:03.200 --> 48:08.160
Well, you know, just like fun, like a cult-y type stuff, I'm like pretty into that kind

48:08.160 --> 48:09.160
of thing.

48:09.160 --> 48:11.240
I used to be more into it, but.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.880
How much do you know about all that?

48:12.880 --> 48:16.800
I mean, I read a fair amount, I'm like really into that kind of stuff.

48:16.800 --> 48:22.600
It's really, I don't know, it's like, it's fun to think that maybe there's more to the

48:22.600 --> 48:24.160
world than there is, but, you know.

48:24.160 --> 48:27.640
Do you believe it or is it just like a fantasy kind of thing?

48:27.680 --> 48:33.200
Well, I mean, it's just like being into sports or anything else, you know, it's like, oh,

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
that's fun.

48:34.200 --> 48:39.640
If we had a bunch of questions, hypothetically, about a cult-y type stuff, you think you might

48:39.640 --> 48:42.440
know information that could shed some light on those things?

48:42.440 --> 48:46.280
Well, I've read quite a bit, I could probably point you in the right direction.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.280
Right on.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.280
Good to know, good to know.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.280
What do those symbols mean?

48:49.280 --> 48:50.600
What do they symbolize?

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
Which one?

48:51.600 --> 48:52.600
All of them.

48:52.600 --> 48:57.440
The one with the dark circle with the circle, the other dots around it.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.440
What's that one?

48:58.440 --> 48:59.440
What if we go in order?

48:59.440 --> 49:02.160
All right, I mean, yeah, sure, why not?

49:02.160 --> 49:08.460
The one with the circle with the other circles around it is, it's this old ancient sign for

49:08.460 --> 49:14.640
this weird group that used to exist, maybe, I don't know, have you ever, I forget, it's

49:14.640 --> 49:20.760
like this group that tries to like keep the world together kind of thing.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.240
What are they called?

49:22.280 --> 49:24.880
They're called the circle of knowledge.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.880
How many people were in it?

49:25.880 --> 49:26.880
Oh, I don't know.

49:26.880 --> 49:28.560
I mean, it's probably not real.

49:28.560 --> 49:29.560
It's like the Illuminati.

49:29.560 --> 49:30.560
Okay.

49:30.560 --> 49:32.400
How about the one with the tree branches?

49:32.400 --> 49:34.400
Oh, I don't know much about that one.

49:34.400 --> 49:39.760
That's just, it was on a bunch of old texts that I've seen around before and I always

49:39.760 --> 49:40.760
liked it.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
I thought it was real pretty.

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
Seen around where?

49:42.760 --> 49:48.040
Oh, at different museums and different libraries and such.

49:48.040 --> 49:54.280
And in relation to any particular culture or across many cultures and times.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.240
Seems like probably the latter.

49:56.240 --> 50:01.200
And then there's one that's like some stars and some swirls and some triangles.

50:01.200 --> 50:08.920
Oh yeah, that one's just like a fun take on like the chaoticness of the universe.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.960
Has my voice changed during this conversation?

50:11.960 --> 50:15.600
It's it's no more than usual.

50:15.600 --> 50:16.760
It's consistent enough.

50:16.760 --> 50:17.760
Yeah.

50:18.480 --> 50:19.720
I'm not like, Whoa man, who am I talking to?

50:19.720 --> 50:20.720
All right, cool.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.520
Yeah, no, as long as you know, it's me, Gary.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.520
Wait, were there four?

50:23.520 --> 50:25.080
How about the weird question mark one?

50:25.080 --> 50:28.120
Oh, that one's about a land unknown.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.680
Do you know anything about it?

50:29.680 --> 50:33.080
Officer Vigna, why would you ask me such a silly question?

50:33.080 --> 50:34.080
I'm just goofing.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.080
You're funny.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.080
New boot goofing.

50:36.080 --> 50:38.080
A land unknown.

50:38.080 --> 50:39.080
Well, that's, that's mysterious.

50:39.080 --> 50:42.200
Can you tell us more about the circle of knowledge?

50:42.200 --> 50:47.600
I mean, all I really know about it is like, maybe there's like one person in the middle

50:47.600 --> 50:53.760
and then maybe six people underneath that person and they hold the knowledge of the

50:53.760 --> 50:55.320
universe or something like that.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.320
I don't know.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.320
It seems cool though.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.320
It's a pretty sweet design.

50:58.320 --> 51:03.480
You seem, you seem a little casual about all these, but you've, you've taken the trouble

51:03.480 --> 51:06.200
to get these nice prints made and had them put up in your restaurant.

51:06.200 --> 51:07.200
Oh yeah.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.200
I'm a fan.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.280
If we, so you, you put these up though.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.440
They haven't been, how long have they been in the restaurant for?

51:12.440 --> 51:15.080
I put them up 30 years ago.

51:15.080 --> 51:16.080
Okay.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.960
The pho restaurant when your great grandfather had it.

51:18.960 --> 51:19.960
Yeah.

51:19.960 --> 51:20.960
The daily pho.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.520
It's been called that since my great grandfather started it.

51:23.520 --> 51:28.600
Do you know how he got around contentions, extremely strict obscenity loss?

51:28.600 --> 51:29.780
Yeah.

51:29.780 --> 51:30.780
One continent.

51:30.780 --> 51:31.780
There you go.

51:31.780 --> 51:32.780
All right.

51:32.780 --> 51:33.780
Okay, Gary.

51:33.780 --> 51:37.840
Well, do you guys have anything else for him or you haven't seen James today at all?

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
Have you?

51:38.840 --> 51:39.840
No.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.560
Where do you think we, do you have James's number or any contact information for him?

51:42.560 --> 51:45.920
I'm pretty sure he lives over in the suburbs, but I don't know.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.960
Do you have an exact address or do you have a phone book perhaps?

51:48.960 --> 51:51.320
Uh, yeah, I've got a phone book.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.080
All businesses have a phone book.

51:53.080 --> 51:54.080
That's what I figured.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.400
Throw that phone book over here.

51:55.400 --> 51:56.400
Let me.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.400
He throws the book at you.

51:57.400 --> 51:58.680
I, it hits, it hits me.

51:58.680 --> 51:59.680
Get it?

51:59.680 --> 52:00.680
Oh, ha ha.

52:00.680 --> 52:01.680
You're in jail man.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.680
Like a, like a police officer.

52:03.680 --> 52:04.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.680
Well.

52:05.680 --> 52:06.680
Would do.

52:06.680 --> 52:07.680
Yeah.

52:07.680 --> 52:08.680
Okay.

52:08.680 --> 52:09.880
I flip through the phone book.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
Oh shit.

52:10.880 --> 52:11.880
His name is James.

52:11.880 --> 52:13.520
How do I find this guy?

52:13.520 --> 52:14.520
It's a monitor.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.320
I'm looking for the only guy named just James.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.320
Okay.

52:17.320 --> 52:20.800
I'm looking, I go to the J's and I start looking for just James.

52:20.800 --> 52:26.200
When you go through the phone book, you do find a person, last name, James, comma, just.

52:26.200 --> 52:28.320
Let me, I'm going to ring him up.

52:28.320 --> 52:29.320
Oh, there's no phone number.

52:29.320 --> 52:30.320
There's just an address.

52:30.320 --> 52:31.320
Okay.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.320
I write the address down.

52:32.320 --> 52:37.880
That's the only, there's not any that is just the single James.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.440
Actually three James mononyms.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.440
Yeah.

52:40.440 --> 52:43.840
Let me go to M and look up mononym.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
James.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
Yeah.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
Is there any, any luck with that?

52:47.240 --> 52:48.240
Roll luck.

52:48.240 --> 52:52.360
James, James, James, and cool James.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
That's a crit fail.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.360
Yeah.

52:54.360 --> 52:55.360
There's nothing there.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.360
The phone book catches fire.

52:57.360 --> 52:58.360
Okay.

52:58.360 --> 53:00.360
Well, uh, he gets angry at you.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.360
He's like, get out of my restaurant.

53:02.360 --> 53:07.760
So I have the address for just James, but we know he works at the mill and we also have

53:07.760 --> 53:08.760
business.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.080
You guys want to go to the mill?

53:10.080 --> 53:11.080
Yeah, I do.

53:11.080 --> 53:13.520
But Gary, you know that circle of knowledge thing.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.520
That's a cool idea.

53:14.520 --> 53:18.040
Do you know of any of anything around today that might still carry on that mission?

53:18.040 --> 53:22.940
Well, it said that the circle of knowledge is all inclusive and all seeing and all abroad

53:22.940 --> 53:27.360
the stores of America and across the world itself.

53:27.360 --> 53:28.360
So yeah.

53:28.360 --> 53:29.360
Okay.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.360
Okay.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.360
Well definitely.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.960
I mean, it seems like trying to think, nope, we're good.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
Appreciate it.

53:35.960 --> 53:36.960
Thanks.

53:36.960 --> 53:39.280
Uh, do you guys want any pho?

53:39.280 --> 53:42.840
I was just about to say, we just had, we just had breakfast.

53:42.840 --> 53:46.120
I just watched Keith eat a big old mess of beans.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.120
So many beans.

53:47.120 --> 53:49.080
I can back some noodles up to go with some broth.

53:49.080 --> 53:50.960
I've been thinking about calling him beans.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.760
Did he like beans as a baby?

53:52.760 --> 53:53.760
This one?

53:53.760 --> 53:54.760
No, he liked cut up hot dogs.

53:54.760 --> 53:55.760
Oh, good.

53:55.760 --> 53:56.760
Pull.

53:56.760 --> 53:57.760
Was that from earlier?

53:57.760 --> 53:58.760
That was like episode one.

53:58.760 --> 53:59.760
That's all he ate.

53:59.760 --> 54:00.760
Ever.

54:00.760 --> 54:01.760
He's the pinky cedar I'd ever seen.

54:01.760 --> 54:02.760
Or maybe the least picky.

54:02.760 --> 54:32.000
How am I, the only one trying to pull over, how am I, the only one trying to pull over,

54:33.000 --> 54:39.480
How can you have enough drowning out all the notes?

54:39.480 --> 54:53.560
There's nobody home, nobody home, nobody home.
