00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
Hello to all my friends, my enemies, people in extra dimensional beards who feel neutral

00:07.600 --> 00:14.800
about my existence, yall know everyone feels nothing but intense love for wolf the dog

00:14.800 --> 00:24.120
which is my name, PTBP which is my radio station, and 694.2 which is my favorite grouping of

00:24.120 --> 00:29.880
numbers to broadcast on, I'm here to love you as you have loved me and bring you some

00:29.880 --> 00:32.880
tasty, tasty information.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.680
But first, this week's Howlin' with Wolf comes from Mia who tagged that pretending

00:38.680 --> 00:43.820
pod on one of them there tweets, thanks for sharing the show with your friends Mia, she

00:43.820 --> 00:44.820
writes

00:44.820 --> 00:51.400
Greetings, the ladies sewing and seance circle would like to remind everyone that our annual

00:51.400 --> 00:56.920
bake sale and dumpster dive are still on for next Friday, the time and location will

00:56.920 --> 01:02.120
be on your bathroom Mia when you get out of the shower tomorrow, thanks for passing that

01:02.120 --> 01:05.320
on Mr. the dog, thanks Mia.

01:05.320 --> 01:12.340
It's good to know the LSSC is still running real strong and generally somehow managing

01:12.340 --> 01:18.040
to both creep everyone out and bore them to death simultaneously, but the trick is on

01:18.040 --> 01:24.120
y'all I don't have a mirror or a bathroom unless you count the streets of the city that

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
is.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.720
Remember, if you want to write up something for your wolf to howl, tag at pretending pod

01:29.720 --> 01:34.920
on Instagram or Twitter, tag pretended to be people on Facebook, or write a 5 star review

01:34.920 --> 01:39.800
on iTunes and email us at pretendingpod at gmail dot com.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.640
If more of your friends listen to the show, you'll have even more stuff to talk about

01:43.640 --> 01:50.680
that completely alienates y'all from the normals and here at 694.2, well we think that's

01:50.680 --> 01:52.280
just swell.

01:52.280 --> 01:59.160
Also the contest happening over on the subreddit ends at 11.59pm central time on September

01:59.160 --> 02:05.640
23rd, if you are listening to this on September 23rd that means it's all over tonight baby,

02:05.640 --> 02:07.440
get cracka lacking my pups.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.680
All entries have a shot at winning a D&D 5 edition starter set and the winner will receive

02:12.720 --> 02:17.100
a hardback slip case set of Delta Green the Role Playing Game.

02:17.100 --> 02:21.480
The winners will be announced next week on episode 46.

02:21.480 --> 02:26.120
Speaking of pretending to be people, it's time for the news.

02:26.120 --> 02:32.840
Last time, a whole lot of plot developed just in time for the main event.

02:32.840 --> 02:38.520
Get ready y'all, for real, cause this shit, this shit is popping off like beef stroking

02:38.520 --> 02:39.520
off.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.880
Going strong like Dijon, other food references.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.160
Are you ready?

02:46.160 --> 02:52.800
Because taking us now to the scrap pit is kudzu baby with no back bone.

03:09.520 --> 03:20.640
Y'all ready for this?

03:20.640 --> 03:27.000
Clark Bishop, Keith Vigna, and Oz Mayhem Wolf walk up the stairs and into the lights and

03:27.000 --> 03:29.280
sounds of the arena.

03:29.280 --> 03:35.720
This colossal room is circular and funnels downward at least 10 stories.

03:35.760 --> 03:41.480
There are thousands of seats surrounding a massive covered cage.

03:41.480 --> 03:47.440
Think the Octagon from UFC but it's 50 yards across and has a bubble looking rounded top

03:47.440 --> 03:51.880
on it that is entirely made of a crystal clear material.

03:51.880 --> 03:58.980
Aggressively loud dubstep is blaring, strobe lights are making the entire experience otherworldly

03:58.980 --> 04:04.360
as green and red and blue lasers swing wildly around the room.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.940
This place feels like futuristic Las Vegas filled with the spirit of all of Vin Diesel's

04:09.940 --> 04:14.360
films if they were tarred and feathered, but the tar is replaced by Red Bull and the feathers

04:14.360 --> 04:16.400
are replaced by cocaine.

04:16.400 --> 04:23.720
There's an enormous logo in the center of the arena floor that says in all caps, the

04:23.720 --> 04:25.660
scrap pit.

04:25.660 --> 04:32.680
And all around the scrap pit in a massive circle are the repeated words, planet juggernaut,

04:32.680 --> 04:39.240
hanging above the bubble is a gigantic circular jumbotron showing a countdown timer blinking

04:39.240 --> 04:47.340
away and flashing the words, Oz Mayhem Wolf and Friends vs Planet Juggernaut.

04:47.340 --> 04:54.280
The music lowers just a bit and a voice says, welcome one and all to a night you will never

04:54.280 --> 05:01.320
forget a fight that'll make you lose your shit alright because nothing is ever left

05:01.320 --> 05:03.640
in the scrap pit.

05:03.640 --> 05:09.840
I am your host and emcee for the evening, Nick Nichols, and as always, I am joined by

05:09.840 --> 05:10.840
my brother.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.240
Hey everybody, it's me, Nick Nichols, here with my brother, Nick Nichols.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.800
I'm Nick Nichols, joined by my brother, Nick.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.020
Welcome to the scrap pit, we've got a hell of a show for you this evening.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.100
What do you think, Nick?

05:24.100 --> 05:28.520
It is an honor and a pleasure to see such bloodsport on a beautiful sunny day in the

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
city.

05:29.520 --> 05:35.740
A vast circle in the floor in the arena opens up and from below, planet juggernaut slowly

05:35.740 --> 05:38.600
raises into the scrap pit.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.900
Thomas raises his hands in the air.

05:40.900 --> 05:46.640
The amphitheater explodes with noise, cheers, boos, fucked up people just screaming their

05:46.640 --> 05:54.520
lungs out and this thing is a shiny metal sphere 20 feet tall with two metallic arms

05:54.520 --> 05:59.280
extending from either side and Thomas just slammed his fist together which is what he

05:59.280 --> 06:04.980
described doing when he went into the machine but here's the catch, Thomas, you've never

06:04.980 --> 06:11.640
been a planet juggernaut before and I want to give Justin a reason to roll some dice.

06:11.640 --> 06:20.200
So, Justin is going to roll a D100 and in order for you to control your body that you're

06:20.200 --> 06:24.240
now in, you have to roll under whatever he rolls.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.240
Now you don't have to do this every round, you just have to do this until you succeed

06:28.240 --> 06:32.900
and then you're fully in control but it might take a couple rounds for you to get used to

06:32.900 --> 06:36.800
this new body or you might be a notch.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.840
You might be a notch-ral.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.120
You might, you might be a prodigy.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.960
Alright, roll me bitch.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.420
Justin, go ahead and roll, let's see what Thomas has to roll underneath to slam his

06:47.420 --> 06:48.420
arms together.

06:48.420 --> 06:49.420
That's a 50.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.440
We got a straight up 50-50 shot here.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
64.

06:52.880 --> 07:00.240
In Planet Juggernaut, his arms are like outstretched in a very awkward way and one of them goes

07:00.240 --> 07:05.800
to swing at the other one to pound its fist into the hand and misses completely, therefore

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
hugging itself.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.440
Clark Bishop, regardless of whether or not you think this robot should be hugging itself

07:12.440 --> 07:20.120
or slamming its fist together, you are in a Colosseum dome fighting pit against a 20-foot

07:20.120 --> 07:21.120
tall robot.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.720
I need you to roll a sanity.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.440
Keith Vigna, you are already gonzo beans.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.640
I am gonzo beans, baby.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.040
I fail and above my power.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.880
Alright, that is really handy.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.000
I need you to roll a d6.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
A 1.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
You lose one sanity.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I hit my breaking point.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.960
You hit your breaking point.

07:41.960 --> 07:47.960
So fun thing for a breaking point, this late in the game we're going to give you another

07:47.960 --> 07:53.400
mania from the sample mania's table in the Call of Cthulhu 7th edition rulebook.

07:53.400 --> 08:02.000
So I'm going to have you roll three times and we will choose which mania you will take.

08:02.000 --> 08:09.160
A 93, a 19, and an 8.

08:09.160 --> 08:16.960
Alright, 93 is Thanatomania, which is a belief that one is cursed by death magic.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.640
That belief does not seem irrational.

08:19.640 --> 08:27.800
19 is Bibliomania, the obsession with books and or reading.

08:27.800 --> 08:31.800
Also extremely fitting, but perhaps not in this current state.

08:31.800 --> 08:40.700
And number 8 is spelled A-I-L-U-R-O mania, so I'm going to go with aileromania, which

08:40.700 --> 08:43.880
is the abnormal fondness for cats.

08:43.880 --> 08:49.720
Gosh, I wish I would have got that one earlier.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.160
Old Doug Jacobs would have had a field day.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.560
I'm going to go with the cursed death magic.

08:57.560 --> 09:06.120
I just pictured you and Doug Jacobs doing a three-legged race, or doing one of the hop

09:06.120 --> 09:08.000
like when you wear a potato sack.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
What's that called?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
A three-legged race.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.560
That's a potato sack race.

09:11.560 --> 09:14.880
Yeah, three-legged race is where you tie your middle two legs together.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.760
They were really on the nose with those names when they came up with those, so you chose

09:18.760 --> 09:20.400
which one?

09:20.400 --> 09:21.920
That he thinks he's cursed by death magic.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.920
Yeah, of course.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.240
That absolutely makes sense.

09:24.240 --> 09:31.360
So you are now, believe yourself to A, be god, A god, B, be cursed by death magic, which

09:31.360 --> 09:38.800
has got to be a rough thing for a god to feel, and 3, you rolled over your power.

09:38.800 --> 09:47.000
And my guess is you are a lot closer to Keith Vigna and Oz Mayhem Wolf than you are to Planet

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Juggernaut.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.800
As the round begins, round one, it is your turn.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.080
This fight's going to end without Thomas rolling a die.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.280
I just murder all the people around me.

09:58.280 --> 10:04.880
Yeah, because of the sanity thing, I'm going to have to dive at whichever one's closest.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.280
Let's roll a 50-50 shot here.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.480
I'll roll a D100 and I'll be under 50.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.480
Perfect.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.640
84, so I'm going after Oz.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.240
So Clark is dressed from the room.

10:19.240 --> 10:25.000
He picked up a bomb squad suit, the suits that are really heavily padded with a helmet

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
and everything.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
He's wearing that.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.040
But he also picked up these pneumatic gloves.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.800
So think Batman, I think, in one of the Dark Knights had them.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.800
Absolutely.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.880
He's going against his forearm strength and finger grip strength, and he's just going

10:38.880 --> 10:43.720
to lunge straight at Oz, and he's going to try and maybe rip his head off.

10:43.720 --> 10:50.020
Okay, Oz is going to roll Awareness to see if he's ready for this attack, and he's not.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.520
So he's not going to roll against you.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.080
You just get to roll an attack on Oz Mayhem Wolf.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.240
So go ahead and roll, what would you call that, unarmed combat?

10:58.240 --> 11:03.640
That was the plan when I decided on one of those gloves, yeah.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.200
I'm guessing you have a higher unarmed combat than you do have a melee, is that correct?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
Correct to my name.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
Alright, well.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.880
Let's see what that roll is.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.600
That's a zero zero three.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.480
Holy shit, that's a success?

11:16.480 --> 11:23.280
Yeah, so theoretically if I'm lunging at him, I'm trying to maybe snap his neck.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.080
Theoretically trying to snap his neck.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.600
Which is a real bummer for Joe, but Clark is going to love it.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.600
Okay.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.040
What do you think, D8?

11:32.040 --> 11:36.240
Do you know what a normal unarmed combat roll damage is?

11:36.240 --> 11:38.800
Probably like a D6 or a D4.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.240
Then like a D8 or a D12 would be what I'm thinking.

11:42.240 --> 11:46.480
Rules knowledge is why people listen to Pretending to be People.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
I'm rolling a D8.

11:47.480 --> 11:51.840
I just think it's funny that you're like, a punch, I don't know, probably.

11:51.840 --> 11:52.840
The most baseline thing.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.800
Standard unarmed, you could say.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.280
I rolled a five.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.560
Alright, Oz Mayhem Wolf.

11:59.560 --> 12:04.720
He's wearing some padding, so he's not going to take all of that damage, but you come up

12:04.720 --> 12:08.760
and do you want to describe what you try to do to him here?

12:08.760 --> 12:12.720
Because you're not snapping his neck, but you are going to put him in a compromising

12:12.720 --> 12:13.720
position.

12:13.720 --> 12:14.720
Physically.

12:14.720 --> 12:19.320
I'll get him in a headlock, and because Clark hasn't snapped many necks in his life, he's

12:19.320 --> 12:23.280
trying to turn in a certain way, and maybe I'm just giving him real bad neck strain.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.280
Real bad Charlie Wars.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.240
Real bad Charlie Wars.

12:26.240 --> 12:32.920
There's a skin burn all around his neck there, and with that, it's Planet Juggernaut's turn.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.920
Thomas?

12:33.920 --> 12:37.520
First, I want to look around at the crowd.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.560
Is Marvin Glass, or is the Emperor in his box anywhere?

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
Interesting.

12:42.560 --> 12:48.160
You actually see a box that looks like it would be the suite where Marvin Glass would

12:48.160 --> 12:51.640
be, and it is currently curtained off.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Okay.

12:52.920 --> 12:59.080
A tiny helicopter blade pops out of the top of Planet Juggernaut's head, and it rises

12:59.080 --> 13:05.960
about three feet off the ground, and it's kind of like...

13:05.960 --> 13:07.720
Let's see if we can actually get that going.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.280
Justin, go ahead and roll a D100.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.280
That's just him turning on.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.060
That's not what I want to do.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.580
It'll still play.

13:15.580 --> 13:19.440
He rolled a 36, Thomas, so you're going to need to roll under a 36.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.840
Yeah, no, this is a great mechanic.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
64.

13:22.840 --> 13:32.520
When I'm 36 and your blade, helicopter chopper blade comes up, and it starts going, but it's

13:32.520 --> 13:35.280
going very conkily and slowly.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.440
Wait, I thought I had to roll over 36.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.440
I'm sorry.

13:38.440 --> 13:42.960
I would have rolled differently.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.560
I had the wrong intent in these dice.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.720
But that's not the completion of your turn, so go ahead and...

13:48.240 --> 13:51.360
I'm just saying, I could have Reiki'd these dudes into...

13:51.360 --> 13:56.360
All right.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.520
Do you have warm hands right now?

13:57.520 --> 13:58.520
I do.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.600
Then roll heat, baby.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.040
Before Justin rolls, tell me what you're trying to finish with this turn here.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.120
You're not going to lift off the ground.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.120
I just wanted to activate.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.120
Gotcha.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.760
Then you failed miserably, and it is Keith's turn.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
Okay.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.400
No, no, no.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
Tell me...

14:13.840 --> 14:18.120
He said it popped out, and it's just flying janky, so you can mess with that idea.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.120
All right.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.720
I want to shoot him with my laser eyes.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.120
Oh, fuck.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.840
Who are you aiming at?

14:29.840 --> 14:31.280
I'm aiming at you, Luke.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.280
Okay.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.280
I figured.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.280
Right at Keith, Vigna.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.640
Go ahead and roll Justin first.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.280
Let's see if this'll...

14:37.280 --> 14:38.280
19.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.800
Can he roll under a 19, Thomas?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
Five.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
Hell yeah, dude.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.800
Baby.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.800
All right.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.400
So you've got laser eyes.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.840
What's that look like on your big, metal, shiny, boar body?

14:54.840 --> 14:57.840
Well, it looks like that villain from Sonic.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
What is that dude's name?

14:58.840 --> 14:59.840
Dr. Eggman.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
Dr. Eggman.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.840
So imagine like that.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.840
Dr. Robotnik, if you're nasty.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.840
Oh, Robotnik.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.840
Yeah.

15:04.840 --> 15:10.440
Just imagine those eyes just like glowing and then shooting lasers out of them at Keith,

15:10.440 --> 15:11.440
Vigna.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.440
Absolutely.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
40% that we talked about.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.080
40%.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.080
40%.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.840
Keith, are you going to try to react with a offensive action or are you going to try

15:20.840 --> 15:22.480
to dodge in some way?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.920
Yeah, I'm going to try to jump out of the way.

15:24.920 --> 15:31.920
I have, in addition to the same bomb squad gear that Clark has on, I have these...

15:31.920 --> 15:38.080
I wrote down gump leg braces, but they're super jump slash super run braces on my legs.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.080
All right.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.920
So I'm going to try to just jump out of the way.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.960
So what is your dodge skill?

15:43.960 --> 15:44.960
Base is 30.

15:44.960 --> 15:53.600
So we'll give you a plus 40 for your cool jumping stuff.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
I got a three.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
You rolled a three, Thomas.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
You're going to roll against...

15:56.600 --> 15:58.760
I just have to roll over that?

15:58.760 --> 16:00.240
Over it and under 40.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.240
Yeah.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.240
84.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.240
Oof.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.240
So...

16:04.240 --> 16:05.240
So I jump out of the way.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.640
As lasers shoot out of the eyes of Planet Jugger and I...

16:07.640 --> 16:10.480
What kind of surface is on the, like, what's on the ground here?

16:10.480 --> 16:14.040
I think like a sterile, shiny metal surface.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.040
Okay.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.600
So it, like, scorches.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
Yeah.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.600
Yeah.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.600
And it makes, like, cool little metalworking.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.600
Star Wars sparks.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.600
It's got little...

16:21.600 --> 16:23.000
It's got the Planet Juggernaut logo.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Like...

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Ooh.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Yeah.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
That's why...

16:27.000 --> 16:29.200
That's why it never hits, because it's really more for effect.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.200
It's much cool.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.200
Can you describe...

16:31.200 --> 16:32.200
Much cool.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.200
Much cool.

16:33.200 --> 16:38.300
Can you describe, I guess, Planet Juggernaut himself, but especially when you say it shoots

16:38.300 --> 16:39.300
out of its eyes.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.020
Where did we see those lasers come from?

16:41.020 --> 16:43.020
The head part, you would be like, oh, that's...

16:43.020 --> 16:44.020
That's the head.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.020
Like, toward the top?

16:45.020 --> 16:46.020
Towards the top.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.020
Yeah.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.020
If it's a big circle, it's where the eyes might be.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.020
Yeah.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.020
Which from...

16:50.020 --> 16:51.020
If it's a big circle, it could be in the middle.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.020
Not like a smiley face.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.020
More like a Pac-Man.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.020
Got it.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.020
But with now a giant mouth.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.020
Just tiny laser eyes.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.020
Nice.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.020
Yeah.

16:58.020 --> 16:59.020
Oh, actually, I want a giant Pac-Man mouth.

16:59.020 --> 17:03.980
That can open up later, baby.

17:03.980 --> 17:09.220
Keith Vigna, it is your turn after dodging out of the way with your cool jumping boots.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.700
I am flying through the air.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.780
So mid-air, I want to pull out...

17:13.780 --> 17:19.740
I've got a saw launcher that has diamond-bladed saws that shoot out of it, and I want to aim

17:19.740 --> 17:28.000
that over at Planet Juggernaut, and I want to just mid-mass shoot a saw at him.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Like a buzzsaw?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Like a circular saw?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Like a circular saw, yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Okay, gotcha.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.940
So go ahead and roll firearms for me.

17:34.940 --> 17:35.940
Planet Juggernaut.

17:35.940 --> 17:37.460
That's a 42 on a 70.

17:37.460 --> 17:42.420
You can try to make a dodge maneuver here, but you'll have to critically succeed in order

17:42.420 --> 17:43.900
to dodge.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.180
Okay.

17:45.180 --> 17:46.420
No.

17:46.420 --> 17:51.400
Keith, describe what this looks like as you're flying through the air.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.300
You pull out a saw shooting through.

17:53.300 --> 17:58.100
I see the lasers start to form in his eyes, and I can see that they're aimed mostly at

17:58.100 --> 17:59.100
me.

17:59.100 --> 18:04.460
So I jump out of the way, and I'm about 10 feet up in the air, going over to the side

18:04.460 --> 18:13.060
away from Oz and Clark, and I pull out, kind of looks like a giant crossbow, and it has

18:13.060 --> 18:18.500
a giant circular saw on it, and you can tell that the edges are shiny.

18:18.500 --> 18:27.220
And I aim it, shoot it, and it flies circular, just shooting right at Planet Juggernaut,

18:27.220 --> 18:28.220
and it whacks.

18:28.220 --> 18:29.220
All right.

18:29.220 --> 18:32.780
Call that 1d8 plus 3.

18:32.780 --> 18:35.260
Put that down.

18:35.260 --> 18:36.820
That's 8 plus 3.

18:36.820 --> 18:38.380
Oh, smacks.

18:38.380 --> 18:45.340
So this blade fully embeds itself into one of the eyes, or where the laser came out of

18:45.340 --> 18:46.340
Planet Juggernaut.

18:46.340 --> 18:47.660
He said midsection.

18:47.660 --> 18:53.700
The midsection of a face is where the eyes are.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.620
The nose is the face's belly button.

18:55.620 --> 18:56.620
Take away my laser eyes.

18:56.620 --> 18:57.620
No, no, no.

18:57.620 --> 18:58.620
It doesn't take him away.

18:58.620 --> 19:05.180
It is going to take down the damage a little bit, and it embeds itself fully in there as

19:05.180 --> 19:06.860
you take 11 damage.

19:06.860 --> 19:07.860
Nice.

19:07.860 --> 19:15.020
It is Oz Mayhem Wolf's turn, and he is confused.

19:15.020 --> 19:23.380
He is going to run, and as he runs, he's going to try to jump at Planet Juggernaut.

19:23.380 --> 19:27.500
So he is going to roll.

19:27.500 --> 19:35.100
If you want to dodge, you can oppose this roll with a dodge roll, Thomas.

19:35.100 --> 19:39.340
I crit failed.

19:39.340 --> 19:45.860
So basically, he has these boots on that, as he's running toward you, as he's about

19:45.860 --> 19:53.420
to take off, he clicks a button and a little thing in his hand, much like one would click

19:53.420 --> 19:56.140
the ignition of a bomb or something like that.

19:56.140 --> 20:01.060
And as soon as he does so, he gets prepared and ready to jump.

20:01.060 --> 20:04.500
He barely makes it out one inch off the ground.

20:04.500 --> 20:10.820
He comes out of his shoes, and his boots are stuck to the ground underneath him, and he

20:10.820 --> 20:17.500
falls on his face in front of him, halfway in between the group and Planet Juggernaut.

20:17.500 --> 20:22.260
And the crowd goes wild.

20:22.260 --> 20:26.740
And the crowd goes wild after that crazy first round, Mick.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.220
What did we see out there?

20:28.220 --> 20:30.820
We saw Planet Juggernaut really struggling.

20:30.820 --> 20:33.020
Yeah, you know, Mick.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.020
Wait.

20:34.020 --> 20:38.860
I'm Mick, you're Mick, we're all Mick for Nichols.

20:38.860 --> 20:44.820
You know, Planet Juggernaut had a 97% murder rate in the first 45 seconds before this match.

20:44.820 --> 20:45.820
Has he lost it, folks?

20:45.820 --> 20:46.820
I don't know.

20:46.820 --> 20:51.420
Well, we're only six seconds in, so we will find out shortly, but we have an interesting

20:51.420 --> 20:57.900
thing happen with seemingly one of Oz Mayhem Wolf's friends turning on him in the very

20:57.900 --> 20:59.260
first moments of the fight.

20:59.260 --> 21:03.900
Let's see if that interbreeding continues throughout this contest.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.300
Who knows?

21:05.300 --> 21:09.700
You know what's crazy is we thought Planet Juggernaut lacked humanity, but I'm just not

21:09.700 --> 21:17.820
seeing it from these three out here today.

21:17.820 --> 21:22.180
And with that, let's go ahead and look at the board as we take a quick second to go

21:22.180 --> 21:26.060
to our kiss cam here in the scrap pit.

21:26.060 --> 21:32.220
Looking up, you see on the jumbotron, they're showing just these two dudes in the audience

21:32.220 --> 21:36.500
who are both cheering and one looks a lot like Luke and the other one looks a lot like

21:36.500 --> 21:37.500
Joe.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.740
And the camera zooms in on you guys.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.740
They look at each other tentatively.

21:42.740 --> 21:46.940
Oh, that's a long one.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.340
Looks like there's a lot of passion in that bedroom.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.340
All right.

21:50.340 --> 21:55.940
Let's get back to the action and see what happens in round two.

21:55.940 --> 22:02.140
Clark Bishop, you begin the action in round two.

22:02.140 --> 22:06.380
So I'm feeling better now after I got that aggression out of me and I want to yell to

22:06.380 --> 22:07.380
Oz.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.380
I'm sorry.

22:08.380 --> 22:09.380
I didn't know we were on the same side.

22:09.380 --> 22:10.380
I get it now.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.380
I got it.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.380
We're good.

22:12.380 --> 22:13.380
We're good.

22:13.380 --> 22:14.980
It was like extremely rude of you to come at me like that.

22:14.980 --> 22:16.860
I didn't appreciate it one bit.

22:16.860 --> 22:17.860
It's my fault.

22:17.860 --> 22:18.860
Didn't understand.

22:18.860 --> 22:19.860
I got it now.

22:19.860 --> 22:20.860
All right.

22:20.860 --> 22:24.420
And I pull out my rocket launcher that I have strapped to my back and I'm not aiming at

22:24.420 --> 22:25.420
the body.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.780
I'm aiming at one of the arms.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.340
Ooh, interesting.

22:28.340 --> 22:33.420
So that'll be a called shot and I need you to roll a firearms check for me.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.020
What does the cold shot do to me?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.200
Negative 40.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.620
That's negative 40 for a head shot, but it says negative 20.

22:38.620 --> 22:41.700
I don't have a head, so I think it should be negative 40.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.700
That makes sense.

22:42.700 --> 22:45.000
Up to you as far as, is that equivalent?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.880
Let's call it negative 40.

22:46.880 --> 22:47.880
Cool.

22:47.880 --> 22:53.520
Thomas, what do you, what is planet juggernaut doing to oppose this before we hear that role?

22:53.520 --> 22:58.280
Planet juggernaut puts like one of his arms up in front of his like laser eyes and like

22:58.280 --> 23:01.680
tries to swat at the missile no matter what like happens.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
Love it.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.680
We'll see.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.640
All right, let's hear that role.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.120
It's a fail because of the minus 40.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.120
It's a 74.

23:09.120 --> 23:14.280
So he, he just like nimbly just like flicks it and it goes like tumbling into part of

23:14.280 --> 23:15.280
the crowd.

23:15.280 --> 23:21.640
It goes tumbling up into part of the dome that's up there and when it hits the dome,

23:21.640 --> 23:27.480
it actually, the entire like floor that you're on and the dome itself rattles and it like

23:27.480 --> 23:33.600
sends reverberations all the way through and you hear just this massive roar from the crowd

23:33.600 --> 23:36.240
as they get fucking amped.

23:36.240 --> 23:41.240
It's like seeing a wreck, but nobody got hurt yet because it's going to happen later.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.840
Probably the hurt, the hurt will happen later.

23:42.840 --> 23:43.840
I would imagine.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.440
And with that it is a planet juggernaut's turn.

23:46.440 --> 23:47.440
Okay.

23:47.440 --> 23:52.600
He, he putters out with his little helicopter directly over Oz mayhem wolf and then turns

23:52.600 --> 23:54.600
off the helicopter.

23:54.600 --> 24:01.620
All right, so I, you don't have to do anything in order to succeed at that and I will simply

24:01.620 --> 24:04.580
roll a dodge out here in front of you.

24:04.580 --> 24:13.140
He's going to turn on a defensive mask on his helmet that basically clogs your sensors

24:13.140 --> 24:17.500
that show you where people are on the field of battle.

24:17.500 --> 24:24.540
And so if he can roll under a 40% actually because you did it, I'll give him a 20% so

24:24.540 --> 24:30.580
he's only got a 20% chance to dodge and he fails with a 60.

24:30.580 --> 24:37.760
A red goo just comes out from, so that will, that will happen.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.260
We will not see the effects of that yet.

24:41.260 --> 24:45.560
Um, because Oz mayhem wolf is out of sight, but not out of my mind.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.860
I feel something.

24:46.860 --> 24:52.500
It's like a leg or something caught in some of my gears feels weird.

24:52.500 --> 24:59.920
For my second attack action, I want to punch Joe going to punch the old Clark Bishop who

24:59.920 --> 25:03.900
just shot a rocket launcher in your direction.

25:03.900 --> 25:07.900
Clark you've already attacked, so you can roll a dodge if you would like to oppose.

25:07.900 --> 25:09.460
I would like to.

25:09.460 --> 25:14.700
If you have any sort of a thing on you that can help you mechanically, holler that out

25:14.700 --> 25:15.700
now.

25:15.700 --> 25:20.160
Well, I did write down that I've got the same kind of pneumatic legs as Keith and give yourself

25:20.160 --> 25:24.280
a plus 40 on that Dodge, which takes your Dodge up to 90.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.280
Holy shit.

25:25.660 --> 25:29.160
Thomas playing at juggernaut is rolling a 60%.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.160
I believe.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.160
Is that right?

25:31.160 --> 25:32.160
Uh, yeah.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.160
All right.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.820
So is this, what is this contested on?

25:34.820 --> 25:39.540
The punching is just your standard fighting skill for punching.

25:39.540 --> 25:40.940
Right.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.580
So I passed that, but how am I ever going to pass a 90%?

25:44.580 --> 25:45.580
It's a contest.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.060
So you just did cause I rolled a nine.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.660
I passed, but I was lower than him.

25:50.660 --> 25:51.660
Oh, I see how that works.

25:51.660 --> 25:52.660
Okay.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.660
How will he ever beat that?

25:54.660 --> 25:55.860
I get it.

25:55.860 --> 26:00.600
So describe your action as a Clark Bishop tries to jump out of the way.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.440
So this all kind of happens in one move.

26:02.440 --> 26:09.900
Like he's puttering over towards Oz and he like flicks the rocket as he's coming down

26:09.900 --> 26:11.040
onto him.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.880
And then he kind of like Springs up back towards Clark.

26:13.880 --> 26:18.740
You see the little helicopter blade where again, he's just had his hand up from where

26:18.740 --> 26:22.440
he flipped the thing and he just brings it straight down at Clark.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.440
Oh, okay.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.440
Roll 66 for damage.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.860
Oh no, wait, does my body armor help me?

26:30.860 --> 26:31.860
Yeah.

26:31.860 --> 26:32.860
Okay.

26:32.860 --> 26:34.780
You'll get five DR damage resistance.

26:34.780 --> 26:36.780
Still fucked.

26:36.780 --> 26:48.660
16 to Malort for math, quick math, 10, 16, 18, 21, 23.

26:48.660 --> 26:53.420
What is your, so 23 minus five, 18, 18.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.960
And what is, what was your health at before?

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
Uh, 26.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.960
So I'm now at eight.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.120
Do you want to spend luck to reduce some of that damage?

27:03.120 --> 27:04.120
Yeah.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.120
You've gotten a lot of luck.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.120
Don't you?

27:06.120 --> 27:07.120
Yeah.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.720
It's 10 whole points to reduce it by one D six, which isn't that big a deal if you're

27:10.720 --> 27:12.840
rolling 12 of them at a time.

27:12.840 --> 27:13.840
Six of them.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.820
Six, six D six, not 12, but that's literally one sixth.

27:17.820 --> 27:20.080
I'll use 10 luck to mitigate it by a D six.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.080
All right.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.080
Roll that D six.

27:22.080 --> 27:23.380
I got three back.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.380
All right.

27:24.380 --> 27:28.340
So I'm at 11 and I'm at 50 luck.

27:28.340 --> 27:29.340
Jesus.

27:29.340 --> 27:36.900
Motherfucker sitting at like 60 luck and it's like, I'm going to spend 10 Keith Vigna.

27:36.900 --> 27:38.300
It is your turn.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.300
Okay.

27:39.300 --> 27:45.740
I'm going to jump up kind of closer to planet juggernaut and I want to use my suction gloves

27:45.740 --> 27:51.140
that I have on to suction on to the wall, maybe like 10 feet above him.

27:51.280 --> 27:57.360
And then I want to pull out my nitro thrower and aim it at him and try to freeze his propeller.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.800
Fucking dope.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.800
Very good.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.800
Okay.

28:01.800 --> 28:10.040
Uh, so you can roll a firearms check in order to try to attain that goal.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.240
Thomas, do you want to combat it in a Dodge movement?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.240
Yes.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.240
Fair.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.240
I got a 65 on a 70.

28:20.340 --> 28:21.340
Oh shit.

28:21.340 --> 28:22.340
All right.

28:22.340 --> 28:27.700
So describe what happens is you basically, so I go from where I landed after shooting

28:27.700 --> 28:34.740
that saw, I jump up over about 10 feet above juggernaut and about five or 10 feet away

28:34.740 --> 28:36.420
from him as well.

28:36.420 --> 28:42.900
I use one hand with a suction glove to suction on to the dome.

28:42.900 --> 28:50.220
I pull out the nitro thrower and I just let it unload all over the top of planet juggernaut.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.200
Yeah.

28:52.200 --> 29:04.880
And as you shower planet juggernaut with your nitro, you render his ability to hover

29:04.880 --> 29:05.880
useless.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.880
Yeah.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
Nice.

29:07.880 --> 29:15.120
You see another little propeller pop up, but it takes a second to whir around.

29:15.140 --> 29:22.180
You guys look over, uh, you saw planet juggernaut bounce essentially off of Oz mayhem Wolf and

29:22.180 --> 29:30.360
looking in the dent planet juggernaut left in the floor, you see crawling out from the

29:30.360 --> 29:40.860
dent is Oz mayhem Wolf and he looks fucking rough and he crawls and he sits cross-legged

29:40.860 --> 29:43.340
and tries to put his boots back on.

29:43.560 --> 29:46.960
And that's the end of round two.

29:46.960 --> 29:50.080
Nick Nichols, we have seen some stuff today.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.760
First we have Clark Bishop shooting a rocket launcher that gets flicked right out of the

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
way.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.760
What'd you think about that one, Nick?

29:56.760 --> 30:00.520
You know, that scrappy fellow really is impressing me today with his inability to do much of

30:00.520 --> 30:02.880
anything useful at all for his team.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.560
Planet juggernaut smashed that scrappy fellow like a plastic bag filled with warm ground

30:06.560 --> 30:07.560
up pork.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.240
I don't know about you, but I am positively starving.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.680
I am absolutely hungry now.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.020
Thank you for that delicious analogy.

30:15.020 --> 30:20.860
And then planet juggernaut just sits right on top of Oz mayhem Wolf before bouncing off

30:20.860 --> 30:24.380
to slap Clark Bishop right on top of the head.

30:24.380 --> 30:29.860
I have never seen a man completely disappear under planet juggernaut like that before and

30:29.860 --> 30:30.860
emerge alive.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.900
It truly was a sight to see.

30:33.900 --> 30:40.240
Oz mayhem Wolf is a regular here in the scrap pan and has been ever since his brother got

30:40.240 --> 30:42.980
fucked over by Marvin Glass.

30:42.980 --> 30:48.820
And then with that one, we saw Keith Vigna, former police officer from contention and

30:48.820 --> 30:53.700
a cadet from the city do some very cool movements.

30:53.700 --> 30:56.580
What did you think about the stuff that he did?

30:56.580 --> 30:59.700
I've heard nothing but horrible things about Keith Vigna.

30:59.700 --> 31:03.780
Quite frankly, I am super impressed with his performance today.

31:03.780 --> 31:09.420
It has been one dope thing after another from that weird looking dude.

31:09.420 --> 31:15.200
Down in the field, we have our correspondent.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.840
What's our correspondent's name tonight, Nick Nichols?

31:17.840 --> 31:18.840
Who's down there?

31:18.840 --> 31:19.840
Who do we got?

31:19.840 --> 31:21.200
What kind of correspondent is he?

31:21.200 --> 31:23.960
Oh, he's doing the trivia contest today.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.440
Jeremiah Jones, I think.

31:25.440 --> 31:31.360
Jeremiah Jones is down there and he's got three contestants from the audience and he

31:31.360 --> 31:34.720
is ready to interview them now and ask some questions.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.000
Let's take it down to Jeremiah.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.540
Hi, hey everybody, it's Jeremiah Jones and I'm here with three people who are here to

31:46.540 --> 31:52.260
watch the Scrap Pit fight and we're going to try to win some prizes today.

31:52.260 --> 31:56.340
If you want to introduce yourselves, what is your name, sir?

31:56.340 --> 31:57.340
Woo!

31:57.340 --> 32:00.860
I'm David from Akron.

32:00.860 --> 32:04.300
We drove 350 miles to be here tonight in the Scrap Pit.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.720
I'm rooting for Planet Juggernaut.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.720
Woo!

32:07.720 --> 32:11.680
Okay, David, thanks for being here and who's next to you here?

32:11.680 --> 32:12.960
I'm little Davey.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.520
I'm David's son.

32:14.520 --> 32:18.280
Speak up, little Davey.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.880
He made me drive the whole way here because he was drinking.

32:21.880 --> 32:22.880
Woo!

32:22.880 --> 32:23.880
Woo!

32:23.880 --> 32:26.560
And you, sir, there on the end.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.720
Hello there.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.200
I'm a fan of Oz.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.000
I came to see everybody he's in.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.520
I love him so.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.860
Okay, so we've got some pretty cool prizes for you guys.

32:35.860 --> 32:41.180
If you could answer these questions, then you might win a t-shirt.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.140
It's got Planet Juggernaut on it.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.580
Would you like that tonight, guys?

32:45.580 --> 32:46.580
Woo!

32:46.580 --> 32:50.300
Yeah, I'll give it to my dad if I win.

32:50.300 --> 32:55.500
If I win, I'll give it to his dad as well.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.940
I don't see any way I can lose tonight.

32:58.940 --> 32:59.940
Okay, David.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.460
Everything's coming up, Dave.

33:02.480 --> 33:07.600
Dave, it seems like you've got a really good chance of winning a t-shirt here.

33:07.600 --> 33:19.120
First question, on which day of the week are Americans most likely to get blackout drunk?

33:19.120 --> 33:23.080
Any day that ends in Y, brother.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.920
But seriously, Friday?

33:24.920 --> 33:26.460
Yeah, yep.

33:26.460 --> 33:27.460
It's Friday.

33:27.460 --> 33:31.560
It is Friday and you win a t-shirt with Planet Juggernaut on it.

33:31.700 --> 33:35.620
David, close your ears.

33:35.620 --> 33:39.540
I honestly don't remember more Fridays than I do, if you know what I mean.

33:39.540 --> 33:41.540
I personally don't know what you mean.

33:41.540 --> 33:42.540
I remember everything.

33:42.540 --> 33:46.140
I slap him really hard on the back.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.700
Woo!

33:47.700 --> 33:51.620
I remember my childbirth.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.100
David Jr., it's your turn.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.060
We've got a trivia question.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.060
It's little Davey.

33:56.060 --> 33:58.420
Oh, little Davey.

33:58.440 --> 34:02.560
I've got a question for you here.

34:02.560 --> 34:06.200
What color is a bird?

34:06.200 --> 34:10.760
Um, uh, blue.

34:10.760 --> 34:11.760
That's right.

34:11.760 --> 34:12.760
That's right.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.760
You get a t-shirt.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.760
There are blue birds.

34:14.760 --> 34:15.760
Hey, yeah.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.140
Way to go, little dude.

34:17.140 --> 34:22.000
Little Davey gives it to his dad and then kind of cowers away.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Dave wipes a tear from his eye.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.720
A single tear.

34:25.720 --> 34:27.320
I love you, dad.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.740
I love you, little Davey.

34:28.740 --> 34:29.740
That's right, Ning Nickels.

34:29.740 --> 34:35.100
We had to make some of the questions a bit easier because people were not sober enough

34:35.100 --> 34:37.500
to answer proper trivia questions.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.020
Let's go back down to that third question.

34:39.020 --> 34:40.180
What do you think about all that, Nick?

34:40.180 --> 34:43.780
I just want to hear Jeremiah Johnson say more things.

34:43.780 --> 34:51.140
Jeremiah Johnson here, and I'm reporting to ask this question of this man who is here

34:51.140 --> 34:54.740
to support his friend from the Motherland.

34:54.740 --> 34:55.740
May Oz Wolf.

34:55.740 --> 34:56.740
Hey, Mayhem.

34:56.740 --> 34:58.160
Oh, I'm so sorry.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.160
What's your name?

34:59.160 --> 35:01.160
It's, uh, Farsi.

35:01.160 --> 35:05.560
Yeah, Farsi, thanks for coming down.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.760
I don't, I don't know Oz.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.000
I just, I just identify with him.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.640
So the fan of Oz, Mayhem, Wolf, and, um, the, the question that we have tonight is, are

35:18.640 --> 35:20.480
you having a good time?

35:20.820 --> 35:26.340
I, I, I was, and then, uh, the juggernaut, he landed on Oz, and I'm, uh, so worried.

35:26.340 --> 35:27.340
That's right.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.340
That's right.

35:28.340 --> 35:29.340
You are worried.

35:29.340 --> 35:33.480
I can tell from my senses of your body.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.480
You won a t-shirt.

35:34.480 --> 35:39.260
All right, thank you, Jeremiah Johnson.

35:39.260 --> 35:43.100
Nick Nickels, what did we think about all this trivia we're having around here today?

35:43.100 --> 35:48.520
You know, you love seeing a father and a son bond so much, and you love seeing a superfan.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.700
You see them like on camera, like Dave and little Davey.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.000
Little Davey is on his Dave's shoulders.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.700
When I'm like, I'm like, give him a woo, little Davey, give him a woo.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.700
Wow.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.220
True parental greatness.

36:03.220 --> 36:06.720
You see me like giving him my beer, like up on my shoulders.

36:06.720 --> 36:11.940
It's really heartwarming to see a father who knows how to take care of a young boy in this

36:11.940 --> 36:12.940
country.

36:12.940 --> 36:13.940
All right.

36:13.940 --> 36:20.400
The action here in round three of the Scrap It.

36:20.400 --> 36:25.520
And starting off round three, we've got Clark Bishop.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.660
Clark Bishop starts round three.

36:27.660 --> 36:30.760
So I'm kind of under the hand of the thing now.

36:30.760 --> 36:37.360
I want to try and wriggle out and use a magnetic trap that I brought with me.

36:37.360 --> 36:41.960
I figure I'll set it under where I am right now, hopefully trapping his arm there.

36:41.960 --> 36:42.960
Awesome.

36:42.980 --> 36:47.180
I was hoping I could use a survival skill for that as far as setting traps go.

36:47.180 --> 36:48.180
Sweet.

36:48.180 --> 36:52.620
Thomas, does Planet of Juggernaut want to try to dodge out of the way here as this is

36:52.620 --> 36:53.620
happening?

36:53.620 --> 36:58.460
Well, I didn't imagine that after I punched you, I just left my hand there, but.

36:58.460 --> 37:03.760
Close enough for horseshoes, hand grenades, and magnets.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.020
Fucking God.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.020
I would.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.020
I crit fail.

37:08.880 --> 37:15.600
You could also say, fuck me, in Clark's, uh, as Clark's character.

37:15.600 --> 37:20.120
It's that goddamn death magic curse at me again.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.120
Me damn it.

37:21.120 --> 37:25.360
Clark Bishop, as you go to set this, what do you have on you?

37:25.360 --> 37:31.720
Let's go ahead and say that as you set this trap and start to scuttle backwards, the trap

37:31.720 --> 37:36.760
sets earlier than you thought it was going to and your rocket launcher flies out of your

37:36.780 --> 37:42.140
hands and sticks to the ground ahead of you, out of your grasp.

37:42.140 --> 37:43.500
That makes sense.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.680
Planet Juggernaut, Europe.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.380
Planet Juggernaut seems eerily still.

37:48.380 --> 37:49.380
Oh no.

37:49.380 --> 37:50.380
Oh no.

37:50.380 --> 37:51.380
Hell yeah.

37:51.380 --> 38:02.380
You see, you see like a faint light coming out of like some seams in him and some vents

38:02.440 --> 38:06.200
are opening up and like letting some steam out.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.440
Uh, and you hear, you hear this like worrying.

38:10.440 --> 38:22.200
It's just kind of charging up Keith Vigner, I'm going to unsuction from the dome and kick

38:22.200 --> 38:30.040
off the dome to get, try to get to the far end, as far away as I can from a planet juggernaut.

38:30.060 --> 38:39.700
And I want to set up a mounted 50 cal machine gun with armor piercing bullets and let go.

38:39.700 --> 38:45.060
So first things first, I need you to roll a dexterity because when you put your feet

38:45.060 --> 38:53.300
on the dome, your feet feel an adhesive and you are stuck to the dome.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.080
Yeah, I failed my dexterity roll.

38:55.080 --> 38:58.260
And you cannot release from this position.

38:58.260 --> 39:02.040
You are now hanging by your feet on the side of the dome.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.680
Can I still use an attack or is that?

39:04.680 --> 39:07.440
You will be at a negative 40 percent.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.440
Okay.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.520
I'll launch another saw at him.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.880
Go ahead and roll that firearms check for me.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.560
Is it at a negative 40?

39:17.560 --> 39:18.560
It is indeed.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.560
So what's that make your firearms?

39:19.560 --> 39:22.200
30, but I rolled a 13.

39:22.200 --> 39:26.440
Oh, planet juggernaut is currently unable to dodge.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.860
So you will roll a success there.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.740
What did I have you write down there for damage?

39:30.740 --> 39:31.740
G8 plus three.

39:31.740 --> 39:34.460
Roll that D8 for me, Lukey boy.

39:34.460 --> 39:36.140
That is a four total.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.140
Four total?

39:37.140 --> 39:38.140
Yeah, one plus three.

39:38.140 --> 39:39.580
Well, that explains it.

39:39.580 --> 39:46.180
You are hanging upside down, shooting backwards at your target like a sloth with a gun.

39:46.180 --> 39:50.260
It kind of like arcs through the air and then kind of like skids off him flying.

39:50.260 --> 39:53.220
The armor piercing round does not quite pierce the armor.

39:53.220 --> 39:55.220
Well, no, this was the saw blade.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.360
Whatever dude.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.360
So it leaves a big catch.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.360
Yeah, it chops off a little bit of him, but not much.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.360
Shing!

40:02.360 --> 40:03.360
Shoo!

40:03.360 --> 40:04.360
Foo!

40:04.360 --> 40:16.840
And with that, it is Oz Mayhem Wolf's turn and he is getting his shoes back on and as

40:16.840 --> 40:24.160
he gets his boots back on, he stands up, clicks a button in his left hand and begins running

40:24.180 --> 40:30.500
toward Planet Juggernaut once again, hopefully this time in a successful manner.

40:30.500 --> 40:37.640
However, as he runs, a panel on the ground lifts up and flings him.

40:37.640 --> 40:41.400
So let's see if he can avoid this.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.860
He fails his roll.

40:42.860 --> 40:46.780
So he gets flung out of the air.

40:46.780 --> 40:52.780
He's just running and you see a panel on the floor just launch him and he flies into the

40:52.800 --> 40:56.800
dome and gets stuck like a spider in a web.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.960
No, spiders don't get stuck on webs.

40:58.960 --> 41:03.400
Like a fly in a web.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
Like not a spider on a web.

41:05.400 --> 41:08.400
Like a man in his house.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.280
Wait.

41:10.280 --> 41:15.560
Stuck to one position where he can only look out into the audience and as he's looking

41:15.560 --> 41:23.340
out into the audience, he sees moving past a crowd of allured, yelling, drunk assholes.

41:23.340 --> 41:29.180
He sees a very short young woman and a very tall old man, both wearing black suits, white

41:29.180 --> 41:35.660
shirts, black ties, black sunglasses, and ill-fitting windbreakers moving through this

41:35.660 --> 41:38.580
crowd of nonsensical monsters.

41:38.580 --> 41:42.420
You hear a faint, woo, somewhere in the crowd.

41:43.320 --> 41:49.640
Many, many, many faint woos as the crowd is going nuts because shit is getting crazy.

41:49.640 --> 41:53.720
And that is our third round here in the scrap pit.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.720
Boy howdy.

41:54.720 --> 42:02.760
Right around we have Clark Bishop, ex-contention police officer, current monster and god thinker

42:02.760 --> 42:04.000
of himself.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.100
He just cannot get anything off today.

42:07.100 --> 42:09.320
His rocket launcher flew right off his back.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.320
You know what I have to think?

42:10.320 --> 42:11.760
What do you have to think, Nick?

42:11.760 --> 42:16.500
I wonder, and you know I truly do wonder, is he cursed by death magic?

42:16.500 --> 42:22.660
I think it's 100% possible that this Clark Bishop could indeed be cursed by death magic.

42:22.660 --> 42:27.960
And Planet Juggernaut is doing something, ooh, boy howdy, he's got something up his

42:27.960 --> 42:29.700
proverbial arms.

42:29.700 --> 42:32.900
You know, I'm wondering if he's planning for the big one.

42:32.900 --> 42:38.000
Oh, he just might be, and if we get to see him pull this off, boy howdy, would this fight

42:38.000 --> 42:39.980
not last much longer.

42:39.980 --> 42:45.560
I truly do hope that he hasn't lost his will to murder and he's just hanging out.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.640
That would be a sight to see.

42:47.640 --> 42:52.180
Any time we can get some humanity out of the robots in this world, I think we should go

42:52.180 --> 42:54.120
for it and praise them.

42:54.120 --> 42:56.360
And what do you think about that Keith Vigna fella?

42:56.360 --> 42:59.800
Well, on this turn, he finally fucked up.

42:59.800 --> 43:04.640
We heard that's what he's wanting to do, and he finally got his feet all stucky sticky

43:04.640 --> 43:06.620
on the side of the dome.

43:06.620 --> 43:11.640
You know, if he's trying to hit Planet Juggernaut, and Planet Juggernaut is indeed resting like

43:11.640 --> 43:17.080
some of us think he might be, that would be a really classy move by a really classy guy.

43:17.080 --> 43:22.480
Yeah, we got OsmayHipWolf who's trying to make an attack with boots finally on his feet.

43:22.480 --> 43:27.440
He just gets flung right into the wall where he gets stuck like a spider on a web.

43:27.440 --> 43:33.120
You know, that's crazy, he has been off his game all day today and he is surely disappointing

43:33.120 --> 43:34.740
his greatest fan today.

43:34.740 --> 43:38.060
Let's go ahead and take a quick moment of silence.

43:38.060 --> 43:45.680
Everyone here in the scrap pit remembers our dear brothers, Rich and Richard, right?

43:45.680 --> 43:47.360
Dick and Rich Nichols.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.880
One of those two works.

43:48.880 --> 43:55.640
And they were absolutely proponents of this ring and big security advisors for the making

43:55.640 --> 43:58.440
of this massive dome room.

43:58.440 --> 44:04.820
And we lost them earlier this week, so we would like to take a quick 30 second moment

44:04.820 --> 44:07.140
of silence in their honor.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.440
Whoo!

44:29.440 --> 44:30.440
Both in silence!

44:30.440 --> 44:31.440
Shut the fuck up!

44:31.440 --> 44:32.440
Oh my god!

44:32.440 --> 44:33.440
No, no!

44:33.440 --> 44:34.440
That was 30 seconds!

44:34.440 --> 44:35.440
Happy you lost all your humanity's time!

44:35.440 --> 44:51.940
That was 30 seconds for your creepy ass brothers, whoo!

44:51.940 --> 44:55.120
That man must have known our brothers, they were creepy assholes.

44:55.120 --> 44:58.120
Let's get back to the action here in Route 4.

44:58.120 --> 44:59.120
What do you say, Dick?

44:59.120 --> 45:12.500
Yeah, the crowd is really wanting to see some blood here today and I, you know, I also do.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.180
Back to the top of Route 4.

45:14.180 --> 45:15.740
Clark Bishop, it's your turn.

45:15.740 --> 45:20.380
That trap that shot up and flung Oz, can I see, is it still up?

45:20.380 --> 45:23.580
No, the ground immediately went back to where it was.

45:23.580 --> 45:29.000
I want to run over to it and knowing that it's there, try to use its angle and momentum

45:29.000 --> 45:32.240
to launch me onto Planet Juggernaut.

45:32.240 --> 45:34.240
Roll an athletics check.

45:34.240 --> 45:39.540
Can I do decks?

45:39.540 --> 45:41.040
Roll a dexterity check there, whoo!

45:41.040 --> 45:45.400
Oh my god, Dex Shepard would be a pretty good name for a roleplaying deck.

45:45.400 --> 45:50.360
I pass a 17 and that would pass both athletics and decks.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.360
Alright.

45:51.360 --> 45:56.900
Planet Juggernaut is still warming himself, so you will be able to do this real quick.

45:56.900 --> 46:03.420
Just want to say, Dex Shepard, be like a, like a, like a thief.

46:03.420 --> 46:04.620
Yeah, like a rogue.

46:04.620 --> 46:07.380
Yeah, like a rogue who's like a wheelman.

46:07.380 --> 46:08.380
What's a wheelman?

46:08.380 --> 46:09.780
Like the guy who drives cars.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.180
A wheelman!

46:11.180 --> 46:17.100
You know, like, some dudes are into legs and some are into butts.

46:17.100 --> 46:18.100
He's a real wheelman.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.100
He's a wheelman.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.100
He's a wheelman.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.220
You know that guy, he's a real wheelman.

46:22.220 --> 46:23.220
He's the opposite of Pinocchio.

46:23.220 --> 46:25.520
I'm saying he fucks cars.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.520
He's a wheelman.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.520
Look at the muffler on that one.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.800
Oh my goodness gracious.

46:31.800 --> 46:34.960
So Joe, describe Clark's jump.

46:34.960 --> 46:39.960
He's rushing over to that trap and he's got those pneumatic legs on and the pneumatic

46:39.960 --> 46:43.720
gloves on and he knows where he's going to land so he kind of jumps onto that trap and

46:43.720 --> 46:49.920
it springs up and he flings himself straight at Planet Juggernaut hoping to land kind of

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
on the top of him.

46:50.920 --> 46:56.100
And when he does, he's using those pneumatic gloves to kind of like punch inward and try

46:56.100 --> 46:59.100
and stabilize himself on the top of it.

46:59.100 --> 47:00.100
Oh, cool.

47:00.100 --> 47:03.180
Roll strength here.

47:03.180 --> 47:09.420
That's a pass, a 35 on a 65.

47:09.420 --> 47:14.580
Okay, so describe this exactly how you want it to look.

47:14.580 --> 47:17.780
You know when a bodybuilder is like flexing their muscles, he's coming all the way up

47:17.780 --> 47:23.180
to the top and then half moons around the side and bam, right into the top dome area

47:23.180 --> 47:24.180
there.

47:24.180 --> 47:27.120
And I don't know what's inside it so explain to me what my hands pierce maybe.

47:27.120 --> 47:33.340
So it would be like a thin metal material that would completely wrap around your fists

47:33.340 --> 47:36.000
as you moved them in there.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.560
With the purpose of being stabilized on top of it, so I'm holding it kind of like maybe

47:39.560 --> 47:41.540
you would hold the horn on the saddle maybe?

47:41.540 --> 47:47.640
Stable you are like a horse rider of a horse, Planet Juggernaut.

47:47.640 --> 47:50.440
You have taken your time and you are ready to go.

47:50.440 --> 47:56.880
Clark Bishop isn't on top of Planet Juggernaut for very long because he starts to feel Planet

47:56.880 --> 48:03.720
Juggernaut moving underneath him and he sees the secondary helicopter blade pop out and

48:03.720 --> 48:07.440
Planet Juggernaut rises off the ground and then it's weird.

48:07.440 --> 48:11.280
It's like the outside surface is spinning around something on the inside, but all of

48:11.280 --> 48:19.840
a sudden you're latched on and you're going down a roller coaster and it's spinning slow

48:19.840 --> 48:25.560
but then it starts going very fast and then Planet Juggernaut drops to the ground and

48:25.560 --> 48:27.280
takes off.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.960
You are going to roll, what did we say for this one?

48:29.960 --> 48:31.440
3d6 for every one I hit.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.280
Did I give you a percentage?

48:33.280 --> 48:35.280
The 60 I think.

48:35.280 --> 48:39.080
I don't know, actually we didn't do a percentage, I figured maybe people would just try to dodge.

48:39.080 --> 48:42.680
I think it's just a dodge, so everybody is going to roll dodge.

48:42.680 --> 48:47.760
If you fail your dodge then you take 3d6 of damage.

48:47.760 --> 48:48.760
Do I have a dodge?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.440
You do indeed and we'll start with you.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.280
Or would you try to just disengage?

48:52.280 --> 48:55.600
I mean I think if I succeed this dodge that would do it.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.600
Exactly.

49:01.900 --> 49:02.960
Looks like a failure.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.800
It's a crit fail.

49:05.800 --> 49:10.920
He can't get his hands out.

49:10.920 --> 49:12.000
That's not going to be good.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.920
This is karma for all the amazing rolls I've had this whole time.

49:14.920 --> 49:18.240
This whole campaign.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.920
Joe is going to take 8 points of damage.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.120
Shit, what's that put you at now?

49:21.120 --> 49:22.720
That puts me at 3 hit points.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.560
Alright do you want to use a 10 more luck here or are you going to?

49:26.560 --> 49:28.440
Yeah I'll use 10 more for one d6.

49:28.440 --> 49:30.560
Alright roll that d6.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.560
4.

49:31.560 --> 49:32.560
Nice.

49:32.560 --> 49:33.560
Alright.

49:33.560 --> 49:35.320
So I'm at 7 hit points.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.120
Keith Vigna roll that dodge for me baby.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.400
So do I just do what my normal dodge is?

49:39.400 --> 49:42.960
I don't get any bonus from those legs since I'm stuck probably.

49:42.960 --> 49:45.200
You are actually stuck up.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.720
So you are out.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.760
You're so stuck up.

49:48.760 --> 49:49.760
I will actually.

49:49.760 --> 49:50.760
I'm going to give you.

49:50.760 --> 49:52.640
Finally someone says it.

49:52.640 --> 49:58.800
I'm going to give you a plus 40% for being so far out of the way.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.800
Yeah.

49:59.800 --> 50:02.200
It's 5.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.520
Alright so on that success basically Planet Juggernaut like as he's rolling toward you

50:06.520 --> 50:12.800
realizes that he can't hit you with how high you are and so bails and goes after Oz Mayhem

50:12.800 --> 50:16.080
Wolf who rolls an 83 failing.

50:16.080 --> 50:19.880
So roll 3d6 for me Thomas.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.600
12.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.920
Ouch.

50:22.920 --> 50:26.320
Oh wow okay.

50:26.360 --> 50:32.960
The ball starts rolling and Clark Bishop can't get his hands out from underneath it and it

50:32.960 --> 50:40.520
rolls over him and with the critical fail it continues to roll toward Oz Mayhem Wolf

50:40.520 --> 50:46.100
and as it rolls over Oz it splatters him.

50:46.100 --> 50:53.920
You actually see just viscera of guts and insides and this black ichor all just kind

50:53.920 --> 51:01.680
of like splurt out on either side and there is now a Nickelodeon style splat of dark red

51:01.680 --> 51:07.680
on Planet Juggernaut but because of the crit fail as he's continuing to roll Clark Bishop

51:07.680 --> 51:10.640
gets rolled over a second time.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.880
So I need you to roll 3d6 again.

51:13.880 --> 51:14.880
6.

51:14.880 --> 51:17.120
6 points of damage and you were at what?

51:17.120 --> 51:21.120
7 so I can survive that with one hit point.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.840
Spend 10 more luck.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.600
I would do that.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.560
Yeah what are you saving the luck for?

51:26.560 --> 51:27.800
The mechanics.

51:27.800 --> 51:30.640
Yeah I mean like.

51:30.640 --> 51:34.960
So you can either spend 10 luck to get a d6 more or you can roll a constitution check

51:34.960 --> 51:37.380
to see if you stay conscious or unconscious.

51:37.380 --> 51:41.600
If you fail the constitution check to stay conscious then you'll have to spend luck to

51:41.600 --> 51:44.240
stay conscious.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.240
Did that all make sense?

51:45.240 --> 51:49.440
It did yeah I am yeah I'm gonna use the d6.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.800
10 more luck spent puts you at what?

51:51.800 --> 51:52.800
30.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.600
He's unable to save himself.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.880
3 so I have 4 hit points total.

51:57.880 --> 52:00.480
Okay then you don't need to roll a constitution check here.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.480
Oh.

52:01.480 --> 52:14.480
Right before Osmayhimwolf dies you hear him go no my brother Elby my cousin V.

52:14.480 --> 52:20.400
It was a plot point it's a me Osmayhimwolf.

52:20.400 --> 52:23.280
All that's cut out.

52:23.280 --> 52:29.000
You just hear from the crowd oh.

52:29.000 --> 52:33.160
You also hear a very emphatic woo.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.560
Keith Vigna it's your turn.

52:34.560 --> 52:39.480
Okay I'm gonna try to so where is Juggernaut right now?

52:39.480 --> 52:40.480
Rolling around baby.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.800
Doing a couple victory laps.

52:41.800 --> 52:49.500
Okay I'm going to reposition my feet on this dome to where I'm aimed in towards the inside

52:49.500 --> 52:52.740
of the dome so what do I roll to do that dexterity?

52:52.740 --> 52:54.120
I wasn't paying attention I'm sorry.

52:54.120 --> 53:00.600
I want to get to where I'm like standing on the dome but I want to like jump up farther

53:00.600 --> 53:05.440
to where I'm like kind of overlooking the dome from above yeah yeah what do I need to

53:05.440 --> 53:13.020
roll for that dexterity for me that is a fail all right you are still stuck feet stuck on

53:13.020 --> 53:14.020
this dome.

53:14.020 --> 53:20.780
Okay I want to shoot another saw at him.

53:20.780 --> 53:27.340
You know it works go ahead and roll firearms.

53:27.340 --> 53:30.740
That's a crit success 22 on a 70.

53:30.740 --> 53:31.740
Nice.

53:31.740 --> 53:36.300
Okay you're like technically already dodging because you're rolling around so go ahead

53:36.300 --> 53:39.620
and roll if you can critically succeed what was your crit success?

53:39.620 --> 53:40.620
22.

53:40.620 --> 53:44.940
And it's impossible for you to win but go ahead and roll anyway.

53:44.940 --> 53:48.300
No okay I think you should roll.

53:48.300 --> 53:52.020
I know I did roll.

53:52.020 --> 53:57.960
Your no was a sign of failure not a refusal to roll I hear you loud and clear.

53:57.960 --> 54:00.120
That is an 8 plus 3 that's 11.

54:00.120 --> 54:06.840
Okay with a critical success yeah dude you're gonna roll that 8 again 11 plus 11 plus 3

54:06.840 --> 54:07.840
so 14.

54:08.040 --> 54:14.500
Right 14 total and describe what this buzz saw does to the as I shoot it it's kind of

54:14.500 --> 54:20.200
where I'm positioned juggernaut is rolling coming at me so the force of the launcher

54:20.200 --> 54:26.160
and the force of him coming at me meet and the saw goes inside of juggernaut.

54:26.160 --> 54:33.760
Woo love it and that is with the death of osmahan wolf that is the end of round four.

54:33.760 --> 54:39.160
Okay boy howdy with the end of round four we've seen a lot of interesting developments

54:39.160 --> 54:44.780
here we have clark bishop he goes ahead and just jumps and makes a big ol punch with hulk

54:44.780 --> 54:49.320
fists right down into planet juggernaut what do we think about that?

54:49.320 --> 54:58.120
What do we think about that?

54:58.120 --> 55:03.320
You know it seems to me he got his hand stuck in the worst cookie jar of all time.

55:03.320 --> 55:07.760
Planet juggernaut's horrible metal body.

55:07.760 --> 55:14.640
Who put their hands inside planet juggernaut clark puts his hands inside oh right no one

55:14.640 --> 55:19.940
left so I'm moving on planet juggernaut guys it was good I was just imagining if like a

55:19.940 --> 55:25.480
sportscaster actually did that fucking terrible it would be.

55:25.480 --> 55:30.760
Planet juggernaut you know he took his time last round to really save up something special

55:30.760 --> 55:32.040
for us this time.

55:32.040 --> 55:36.860
Yeah he uh coiled up like a big murderous roly poly and delivered quite a blistering

55:36.860 --> 55:44.440
attack rolling over clark bishop twice and completely obliterating osmahan wolf into

55:44.440 --> 55:50.320
a pit of pit you don't like the inside of a nectarine that's basically what it looked

55:50.320 --> 55:56.780
like out there with osmahan wolf he is round and wrinkly on the inside his organs are disgusting.

55:56.780 --> 56:00.680
You know the crowd sure is getting aroused by the blood and I can't say that I'm not

56:00.680 --> 56:05.480
feeling a little something too how about you mick I can smell the iron and wine in

56:05.480 --> 56:15.160
the air baby and much like a shepherd dog keith vigno is a one trick pony once again

56:15.160 --> 56:22.840
using the saw blade shooter at his vast disposal while stuck on the side of the dome shepherd

56:22.840 --> 56:29.960
dogs can famously learn many tricks you know I have to wonder why is he not moving is he

56:29.960 --> 56:36.300
too stupid or is he secretly a genius he seems to be landing the most hits at all these

56:36.300 --> 56:42.280
chunks and avoiding the damage at the same time you know I have a fun fact about planet

56:42.280 --> 56:48.640
juggernaut please tell us your fun fact about planet juggernaut nick mackles my fun fact

56:48.640 --> 56:52.760
about planet juggernaut is that he keeps all the leftover teeth from all the matches and

56:52.760 --> 56:58.880
sleeps on a big pile of them that's what I hear it's important to have a legend behind

56:58.880 --> 57:03.560
any great villain at that moment you do see like a little hoover like coming out of the

57:03.560 --> 57:07.920
body of planet juggernaut and like sucking out the teeth that are stuck to him from oz

57:07.920 --> 57:16.760
mayhem just like plugging them out of the uh out of the goo and real quick let's head
