00:00.000 --> 00:16.400
Thanks. Thanks for that fridge. It was like the grudge sound. Sounds like clinking bones.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.640
My fridge used to make that noise and I thought it was mice for the longest time. It's just

00:19.640 --> 00:22.760
the ice machine, right? It's the ice maker, right? I don't have an ice maker. It was something

00:22.760 --> 00:28.380
that went back in the fridge. There was a mouse in the fridge? No man, it was the ghost

00:28.380 --> 00:35.340
of his old fridge. I used to think it was mice and it was. What's up everybody? I'm

00:35.340 --> 00:40.740
Zach. Welcome to season two of Pretending to be People. First off, Joe, do you need

00:40.740 --> 00:44.700
to listen to season one of Pretending to be People? Hell no. But should you listen to

00:44.700 --> 00:48.680
season one of Pretending to be People, Luke? Hell yeah. And what did you think about season

00:48.680 --> 00:51.740
one of Pretending to be People, Thomas? I thought we could do better. That's why we're

00:51.740 --> 00:59.220
here. The whole gang is back together for another quick and simple role playing campaign.

00:59.220 --> 01:03.900
In and out, 20 minute campaign. Justin is also back with us as both Wolf the dog, the

01:03.900 --> 01:09.640
AM radio DJ, who will continue to introduce each episode. And he's also returning as our

01:09.640 --> 01:15.260
in-house composer. Justin actually messaged me and said, hey Zach. That's how he messages

01:15.260 --> 01:21.980
me, or at least the time. Oh, he's got to relate. Parentheses, sultry, sexy. Hey Zach,

01:21.980 --> 01:31.100
I created all new music for season two. What the fuck? We're so fucking excited to have

01:31.100 --> 01:36.420
Justin back in-house composing for season two. Very excited. I hope it's good. Oh, I

01:36.420 --> 01:43.700
listened to it. We'll see. Now we are here because what do we do? We play a role playing

01:43.700 --> 01:51.180
game. We play a tabletop role playing game. That stands for TTRPG. That's right. And

01:51.180 --> 01:55.820
what are TTRPGs, Thomas? Well, that's where you get your best friends around a table or

01:55.820 --> 02:01.140
whatever you have, but we have a table. I thought you meant like best friends or whoever

02:01.140 --> 02:05.300
you have around. Right. Which is also true. We lucked into our role playing group, but

02:05.300 --> 02:10.300
I understand that that is a very common phenomenon. Yes. Fortunately, we are best friends who

02:10.300 --> 02:14.860
role play together. So we get around our table, our tabletop, and we roll some dice

02:14.860 --> 02:18.980
and pretend to be people. And we tell stories together. He said the name. He said the name.

02:18.980 --> 02:23.380
He did it. I got that in there. Hell yeah. So last season we played an amalgamation of

02:23.380 --> 02:28.060
a game called Delta Green, the role playing game and a game called Pulp Cthulhu. This

02:28.060 --> 02:32.480
season we are maybe going to utilize a lot of those same rules, but we're really focusing

02:32.480 --> 02:37.860
in on just using a stripped down version of the original Delta Green rules. Which is a

02:37.860 --> 02:43.020
what offshoot of Call of Cthulhu. It is an offshoot of the game by Chaosium, Call of

02:43.020 --> 02:47.820
Cthulhu. I should mention here Delta Green is published by Arc Dream Publishing. Shout

02:47.820 --> 02:53.220
out to them for creating an absolutely phenomenal game that we can't remember all the rules

02:53.220 --> 03:02.460
to. So we play our own version of it. That's what we mean by stripped down. Complete. Whose

03:02.460 --> 03:10.980
green is it anyway? We should also mention that we play what's called a closed game.

03:10.980 --> 03:15.220
What does that mean? Oh, that just means that when your characters choose to go off on their

03:15.220 --> 03:23.300
own or split the party, then we actually split up our in real life party here and have the

03:23.300 --> 03:28.180
people whose characters are not in the room go into a different physical room. Dude, I

03:28.180 --> 03:32.580
must have not been paying attention like the last season because I legit thought that you

03:32.580 --> 03:38.300
would just like get mad at us and like randomly be like, get the fuck out of this. And I was

03:38.300 --> 03:42.740
like, it's confusing. And then, but you know, sometimes it's like a long time out. Sometimes

03:42.740 --> 03:47.020
it's just like 30 seconds. So, but that makes so much more sense. Luke was getting confused

03:47.020 --> 03:52.700
because we do send them on time outs. Those are different than the closed game. Yeah.

03:52.700 --> 03:56.820
Time out. If any of us were there with you, that was a moment of a closed game. But if

03:56.860 --> 04:03.700
you were just in the corner with your hat, that was a time out. I hate that fucking hat.

04:03.700 --> 04:09.740
Zach, it really defeats the purpose of the discipline if he doesn't even know he's being

04:09.740 --> 04:13.940
punished. That's a good point. You just said fuck. I've already said fuck. Let's talk about

04:13.940 --> 04:19.780
the explicit content warning. Yeah. There's a real big fucking content warning on this show.

04:19.780 --> 04:26.300
And we delve into some pretty dark subjects. Yeah. It's not just cursing. We use the cursing

04:26.300 --> 04:31.020
to describe terrible things. Terrible things is what the explicit tag is for. It is certainly

04:31.020 --> 04:35.380
not just for fuck words. Uh, we're going to get pretty gross. We're going to get pretty

04:35.380 --> 04:41.140
weird. Yeah. Slimy, gory, violent, scary. It's going to get fucked up. Some real twisted

04:41.140 --> 04:50.460
stuff. Although it's fun when we do it. Yeah. If you're scared of, yeah. Trigger warning.

04:50.460 --> 04:57.300
Are you scared of fun? And we've been doing this as a group for a while. Does anyone know

04:57.300 --> 05:03.620
how long we've been playing together? 18, 19 years. It hasn't been quite that long.

05:03.620 --> 05:07.700
I'd divide that by three and I think we'd be about right. So how long did we play before

05:07.700 --> 05:11.300
we started recording? It was like a year and a half. Yeah. We played for like two years,

05:11.300 --> 05:16.860
I think before we started playing. And then season one was almost four years of recording.

05:16.860 --> 05:24.700
We're going to cut that down. So we've been playing together for something like six years

05:24.700 --> 05:29.220
now. From what I've heard on the internet, that is considered rare. How do you think

05:29.220 --> 05:34.300
we've been able to keep it up by making a lot of the rules? Yeah, I would say the fact

05:34.300 --> 05:40.780
that we generally have a great time together is what's going and the money. We have a Patreon

05:40.780 --> 05:52.180
by the way. Yeah. And Hey, that money is not keeping me around yet. So maybe keep Thomas

05:52.180 --> 06:01.620
around. Well, should that be a stretch goal? Keep Thomas. Oh man. I love this group. I love

06:01.620 --> 06:06.620
this group because you're literally my, I was going to say best friends. You're my only friends.

06:06.620 --> 06:12.500
But I also- Is that better or worse? It's the same dude. It sounded like a downgrade in the

06:12.500 --> 06:17.460
middle of the sentence. He's stuck with us either way. Speaking of, you guys played three small

06:17.460 --> 06:22.260
town cops last season. This season, we're not doing that. And we're also not playing Delta

06:22.260 --> 06:27.220
Green agents. What are you guys up to this season? We'll say goodbye to the small town because we're

06:27.220 --> 06:31.700
in the city. We're in the city, baby. We're going to the city. Do you want to know what happens in

06:31.700 --> 06:38.940
the city? We can tell you. Newsworthy action and that's what we cover because we're a fucking news

06:38.940 --> 06:47.220
team, y'all. An action news squad tooling around in our sweet van, bringing you all the news that's

06:47.220 --> 06:55.140
fit to print. Wait, city action news van, the can van? The can van. Fuck yeah. First good improv of

06:55.140 --> 07:03.620
the season. Actually, I have that written down right here in front of me. So thanks so much for

07:03.620 --> 07:12.740
listening to this first episode of season two. And now let's turn that dial to 694.2 PTBP and hand it

07:12.740 --> 07:30.740
over to Wolf the dog. Good afternoon, everybody. And I do literally mean everybody because we are

07:30.740 --> 07:41.740
coming at you live from 694.2 PTBP, the city's oldest and only radio station. It's your sweaty

07:41.740 --> 07:49.860
teddy bear with the news to share, Wolf the dog. It's a wet hot day here in the city this Saturday.

07:49.860 --> 07:59.700
It's June 18th, 2022 if that means anything to you. And oh damn, there's an email in my inbox. Why,

07:59.700 --> 08:06.100
it's a new Howlin' with Wolf. This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from John Scott Tynes,

08:06.940 --> 08:12.940
an American writer best known for his work on the role-playing games Unknown Armies,

08:12.940 --> 08:20.180
Call of Cthulhu, Puppetland, and Delta Green. John tweeted about the show and tagged at

08:20.180 --> 08:28.460
Pretending Pod, a very cool and very easy thing to do. He writes, I've got a message here from

08:28.460 --> 08:36.100
high up on the down low. Hey, clockwork child, love your style. Watch out for minotaurs in the

08:36.100 --> 08:46.140
labyrinth. Dr. Gonzo, keep on keeping it surreal. Jeff Hawthorne, hello and goodbye. Nice job keeping

08:46.140 --> 08:54.940
ahead. And Florida man, master of the dude way. Rock that red beard and tell Jane hi. Blood and

08:54.940 --> 09:04.500
kisses JC lens. Damn now y'all aren't even trying to make sense anymore. Does anyone know what in

09:04.500 --> 09:11.300
the grease any of this means? Kids these days. If you want to write up something for your steamy

09:11.300 --> 09:18.900
Wolf to howl, just tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter or Instagram. Tag pretending to be people on

09:18.900 --> 09:26.020
Facebook. Or if you want to be one of Wolf's favorites, submit a five star review on Apple

09:26.020 --> 09:33.420
podcasts, screenshot that super supportive endorsement and send it to our socials. And if

09:33.420 --> 09:41.340
you want to interact with other nasty folks in this PTBP community, join us on discord or over

09:41.340 --> 09:47.660
in the subreddit. If you want to keep this show alive while also gaining exclusive access to over

09:47.660 --> 09:55.340
40 hours of confidential bonus content, give us your money on Patreon. And if you want to drape

09:55.340 --> 10:03.100
your body in the finest of branded threads, go grab a shirt, hat, beach towel and fanny pack over

10:03.100 --> 10:10.900
at PretendingPod.shop. No need to remember all that. The links are in the show notes and me, I

10:10.900 --> 10:19.820
need to go folks. Find some wet debris and with a whole dose. We've got a brand new theme to warm

10:19.820 --> 10:27.300
up your throats. It's Alter Girl with My Life is Great and It's All My Fault.

10:40.900 --> 11:10.620
Our story begins on a sweltering, muggy Saturday in the city.

11:10.860 --> 11:21.220
It's June 18th, 2022 and walking feels more like wading through a pool. But plenty of people are

11:21.220 --> 11:27.820
parading up and down the perpendicular pathways that make up the city. Each intersection, four

11:27.820 --> 11:35.820
perfectly 90 degree angles. Each street sign, splendidly shining in the sunlight. Each person

11:35.900 --> 11:43.180
walking outside for more than 30 seconds, drenched. The severe and sterile design of the city helps

11:43.180 --> 11:48.460
some folks keep their heads on straight, helps them keep a grip on their reality, but everyone's

11:48.460 --> 11:52.940
different. Though I bet plenty of people would agree it'd be nice to be able to get an eyeful

11:52.940 --> 11:58.460
of the city without being inundated with so many advertisements. Facebook, Olive Garden,

11:58.460 --> 12:05.100
The Godel Company, Gucci, Amazon, The City News, Apple, Exxon Mobil. It's impossible.

12:05.820 --> 12:12.140
They're everywhere. You say The Gobble Company? G-O-T-T-L-E. It's like Butterball. The Godel

12:12.140 --> 12:23.500
Company is a food based company. They work on bio-farming. Wait, that ain't right. Bio-farming

12:23.500 --> 12:35.660
is just farming? Yeah. Then yes. It's organic farming. Is it like growing a steak in a lab

12:35.660 --> 12:43.740
or is it like growing a cow in a field? Honestly, it's more like growing corn in a field. Okay,

12:43.740 --> 12:48.620
to feed the cows? That's just agriculture. Yeah, they're an agriculture, they're an ag company.

12:48.620 --> 12:52.300
Hell yeah. Who's going to be the bad guy, do you guys think?

12:53.740 --> 12:57.500
Zach was hoping he could just slip that Godel in there and we wouldn't mention anything and now

12:57.500 --> 13:06.380
he's got the entire plot ruined. Even Luke took down a note on Godel.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.300
I spelled it wrong and then I wrote over it, but I can tell.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.660
Well, Luke, let's start with you. You're the producer, one of the segment producers

13:15.740 --> 13:20.060
out in the field of City Action News. I want you to tell me about your character and what

13:20.060 --> 13:26.700
they're up to on this oppressively moist Saturday afternoon. My character is Julius

13:26.700 --> 13:31.580
Summers and you can do MFA after that if you want. Do I have to? It's preferred.

13:31.580 --> 13:35.500
I'm getting an NBA vibe from this guy. No business, film and arts.

13:36.700 --> 13:42.700
All right, what's Julius up to on this heater of a start of the weekend? Julius is

13:43.500 --> 13:51.660
in his closet. He is color coding his suits. He's getting ready for his first real week

13:51.660 --> 13:53.900
at Cannes. City Action News.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.740
And he is super stressing out about which suit he's going to wear.

13:57.740 --> 14:01.020
What are your options? Blue, tan or black.

14:01.660 --> 14:05.900
He has 19 suits, various shades of blue, tan and black.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.620
Do you mix and match or do you always keep it monochromatic?

14:08.620 --> 14:12.300
Monochromatic and they're 90s fits.

14:12.300 --> 14:16.380
Oh, anything else I need to know about Julius Summers?

14:16.380 --> 14:22.220
He is starting at City Action News because nepotism, basically.

14:22.220 --> 14:27.340
Speaking of, your uncle calls your cell phone. You get a vibration and the name says

14:27.340 --> 14:35.020
Tyfe Ralen, T-Y-F-E, Ralen. Shout out to Jeff from Seattle. One of our patrons at the $10

14:35.020 --> 14:41.180
above level has given us this character who is a six foot tall man with dark slicked back hair

14:41.260 --> 14:42.940
and a permanent smirk.

14:42.940 --> 14:44.220
Tyfe is a cool name.

14:44.220 --> 14:44.860
It is cool.

14:44.860 --> 14:50.220
Tyfe Ralen is the executive producer of the City Action News and he is

14:50.220 --> 14:52.060
Julius Summers direct report.

14:55.340 --> 14:55.900
Hello.

14:55.900 --> 14:59.500
Hey, what the fuck is up? My beautiful baby nephew. Come on.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.060
Huh? It's a beautiful day for overtime. Yeah.

15:03.260 --> 15:03.760
Stucks.

15:04.620 --> 15:05.180
Overtime.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.060
Good. You keeping the talent happy?

15:08.060 --> 15:13.100
Of course you are. All right. Well, get him, get the camera guy, get them all out to the,

15:13.100 --> 15:19.420
get him out to a farm. Okay. Find a magnetic fucking farmer to do 90 seconds. Only 90 seconds.

15:19.420 --> 15:25.420
Okay. On whether they would sell their land to the Godel company. I heard Fred Godel himself

15:25.420 --> 15:30.300
is going around and closing these land deals in person. See what they think about that, right?

15:30.300 --> 15:34.780
Okay. Just 90 seconds this time. Don't let him go all in depth like he likes to. Oh, and nephew.

15:35.740 --> 15:45.580
Y'all gotta do a TikTok for the can. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm real serious this time. Okay. Yeah.

15:45.580 --> 15:49.260
Yeah. You have to make a TikTok for the can. Can do.

15:49.260 --> 15:55.980
Okay. Have fun. You're based for this bro. And he hangs up. Fuck. A farm in the city?

15:56.700 --> 15:57.420
It's going to be hard.

15:57.420 --> 16:06.700
He, uh, was standing there completely naked because he was trying to decide what to put on.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.060
Who doesn't love a naked phone call with their uncle? It wasn't a FaceTime.

16:12.060 --> 16:17.660
What's his dong like? Um, you see him from the back. So the dong, can you see the dong?

16:17.660 --> 16:21.900
The dong has not been revealed, but he is standing with, he has no thigh gap. So he's standing.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.820
There'd be no way to see the dong. He's thick. He's got, uh,

16:27.420 --> 16:33.980
Julius Summers. Yeah. Big thighs. He ran in, in college and he ran even while he was getting his

16:33.980 --> 16:41.660
masters, which is weird. He big thighs, normal rest of his body. He throws on. So normal dong,

16:41.660 --> 16:46.780
normal dong, normal calves, no more arms, no more torso, huge thighs, huge thighs,

16:46.780 --> 16:51.420
but thick thighs. People are like, whoa, get it, get a load of those. Do they save lives?

16:51.420 --> 16:56.540
They report on whether life was saved or not. Could he smash a watermelon with those bad boys?

16:56.540 --> 17:01.740
He has before. And he'll do it again. Fun party trick in college. He just kind of like closes

17:01.740 --> 17:08.700
his eyes and starts pointing around and then stops and he puts on a light tan suit with a tan

17:08.700 --> 17:16.860
undershirt, a tan tie, tan pants and tan shoes. So everyone can see your sweat stains on this

17:16.860 --> 17:22.460
super hot Saturday. He does, uh, throw on a couple tan undershirts. It's going to be hotter,

17:22.460 --> 17:28.140
but it'll soak up as much sweat as possible. Grabs a cell phone, puts it in his pocket,

17:28.140 --> 17:34.060
grabs the keys to the van, the city action news van, the can van, the can van. Where's it at?

17:34.060 --> 17:45.100
The can van is a parked in front of Julius Caesar's. The can van is parked outside of Julius

17:45.100 --> 17:50.140
Summers house, which is located right on the outskirts of town and the first like little

17:50.140 --> 17:58.140
suburb. He runs out to the van and calls up the talent. All right, sick. So, uh, let's, uh,

17:58.140 --> 18:07.740
let's dive in and see what Thomas's character is. As a character. When you get this phone call,

18:07.740 --> 18:13.260
what are you up to? It's a hot Saturday in the city. Cal Colorado has definitely been

18:13.260 --> 18:18.460
sitting by the phone waiting for a call from his producer. Cal Colorado?

18:18.460 --> 18:23.580
Veteran newsman, Cal Colorado. Holy shit. And he's got, he's got a landline that rings

18:24.780 --> 18:29.500
and he sets down his, his cup of black coffee and he picks up the receiver and he says,

18:30.380 --> 18:39.980
hello, Cal Colorado. Awesome. Cal. Julius. We need to get ready. Ready for what? We are

18:40.540 --> 18:45.020
going to the farm. Which farm? You can figure that out while I drive to come get you.

18:45.020 --> 18:52.060
Cal hangs up confused. The producer doesn't know it's his job.

18:54.380 --> 19:00.220
This is Saturday. Julius's first day, um, was on Friday just as like a, like, you know,

19:00.220 --> 19:05.100
kind of get to know you thing. As soon as the phone is hung up, he's like, fuck that.

19:05.100 --> 19:13.900
And he starts Googling farms near him and the, the can van pulls up on this sweltering hot day.

19:13.980 --> 19:19.020
Honestly, the AC hasn't even kicked in to full gear at this point in time. Windows are kind

19:19.020 --> 19:23.500
of rolled down while you've got the air flying through. Oh, I thought you meant the AC in Cal

19:23.500 --> 19:30.940
Colorado's house because yes it has. It's very well maintained. Oh, what degree? 73. Character

19:30.940 --> 19:37.580
development. Tell me about it stud. Oh, well 73 just seems a little more like I keep it at 69

19:37.580 --> 19:42.060
cause that's funny and comfortable. It's expensive and hilarious.

19:45.420 --> 19:49.980
But Cal Colorado keeps it at 73 no matter what time of year.

19:51.660 --> 19:56.540
He pulls up in front of your house, apartment, high rise. Where are you? Where are you at?

19:56.540 --> 20:02.940
Cal Colorado lives in a modest townhouse. Well-kept with a finely functioning air

20:02.940 --> 20:11.340
conditioner. He sets down his cup of black coffee. He had TV on to like a competitor's network.

20:11.340 --> 20:16.780
Awesome. He was idly like scratching his cat's ears. Can you tell me a little bit more about Cal?

20:16.780 --> 20:24.380
Cal keeps a very neat home. Pretty small. It's just him. The tan line where his wedding ring was

20:24.380 --> 20:30.940
is long gone. Really you can tell he's, he's a pretty simple guy. There's not a lot of flashy

20:30.940 --> 20:37.020
accessories. There are a bunch of pictures along the entrance hall, like showing a long career.

20:37.020 --> 20:41.820
Is it just him shaking hands with different people? It's him with Edward R. Moreau and Walter

20:41.820 --> 20:47.900
Cronkite and Dan Rather on down to like Anderson Cooper. Starting out when he's just like clearly

20:47.900 --> 20:53.820
like a pimply faced intern and going to now he's, uh, he's in his late fifties, tall man,

20:53.820 --> 21:00.780
slim with well-kept but thinning hair. Is he a gray? Is he a gray? Is he a gray?

21:01.660 --> 21:07.500
Spoilers. I'm about to blow this bitch wide open. Is he, uh, is he being controlled by amigo?

21:09.500 --> 21:15.020
Didn't amigos get canceled? Are you guys still on the phone? When I said I'm gonna go get him,

21:15.020 --> 21:21.180
I figured that was the end of the conversation. He's just describing his house to you. I'm like,

21:21.980 --> 21:28.460
I am a simple man with austere possessions, but my memories are important to me.

21:29.820 --> 21:34.780
And out the door, honk honk. Good afternoon, Julius. Are you ready to make some news?

21:34.780 --> 21:40.540
I'm not sure how the last guy did it, but I'm sure I'll do just as well. Well,

21:41.420 --> 21:45.580
Marvin left some pretty big shoes to fill, but you'll get the hang of things.

21:45.580 --> 21:51.180
He just kind of nods and then he calls his camera man and heads to the camera guy's house.

21:56.380 --> 21:59.180
Damn. He didn't answer the phone. Hold on.

22:02.460 --> 22:09.580
It goes to voicemail. Hey, you've reached back. Uh, didn't get to the phone. Uh,

22:09.580 --> 22:12.140
I guess you could try again cause I'm not calling you back.

22:12.780 --> 22:17.180
Julius was going to leave a voicemail and then he hears that.

22:21.900 --> 22:27.260
I keep driving to the camera guy's house. Uh, have, have you been to his house before? I

22:27.980 --> 22:34.780
try not to go in, but yes. Is it that one? It's the one where the top floor is a little burned

22:34.860 --> 22:40.060
out. Pull up to the house and then, uh, just jump out and go.

22:42.860 --> 22:50.860
So inside the house, uh, you see Beck Wilder is laying a face down on his bed. Uh,

22:50.860 --> 22:57.900
he is just in his tighty whities, pasty skin, uh, blonde hair, kind of medium length,

22:57.900 --> 23:04.460
all messy from a fitful night of sleep. There are pizza boxes and energy drinks all over the floor.

23:04.860 --> 23:08.300
And on a desk that has a bunch of computer monitors. When we say bed,

23:08.300 --> 23:12.060
are we talking bed frame or mattress on the floor? Mattress on a floor. Uh,

23:12.060 --> 23:16.700
he's on top of the sheets. Like he obviously just conked forward from a standing position

23:20.220 --> 23:26.300
and uh, he starts to hear the pounding at the door in his dream. Oh, it's his mom has been

23:26.300 --> 23:32.620
pounding on the door in his dream and he's been scared to answer it. And then he, oh, uh, uh,

23:33.260 --> 23:37.980
oh shit. And he starts jumping up and he goes to his closet, he rips it open and there are

23:37.980 --> 23:44.780
a variety of Hawaiian shirts are on the rack. But his favorite one is on the floor crumpled

23:44.780 --> 23:49.100
and he wants to wear the favorite one. So he grabs it and sniffs it. It passes the test.

23:49.100 --> 23:54.140
He throws it on, uh, he goes and opens the door and he still just got the tighty whities.

23:54.940 --> 23:59.100
I really don't appreciate you making a character so obviously inspired by Luke and I.

24:03.580 --> 24:09.900
Uh, Becca's bleary eye looking at you. Hey, uh, uh, hail Caesar. What's up dude?

24:11.100 --> 24:15.820
Julius just kind of looks him up and down. The Caesar reference goes right over his head.

24:16.940 --> 24:20.540
Yeah, I think we might've edited that part out. Nah, give unto summers what is summers.

24:21.420 --> 24:28.220
Give. Is that some fucking newfangled translation? Render bitch. Oh, I, I wasn't allowed to read the

24:28.300 --> 24:35.500
old one. Are you gonna put any pencil on? Oh shit dude. Hang on a sec. Hey,

24:35.500 --> 24:40.940
this is a house is Dawn. Jesus. It's how tight are the whitey spilling out?

24:44.780 --> 24:47.740
So he's standing there. Lenny Kravitzing in front of you.

24:49.340 --> 24:53.660
Luke almost just spit out his shelter. The image immediately was perfect in my mind.

24:53.660 --> 25:00.940
As he unfurls in front of you. Becca is still talking to you from inside the house.

25:01.740 --> 25:04.700
Uh, so I mean like, why are you here man? Do we have something going on?

25:04.700 --> 25:10.540
We're going to the farm. 90 seconds at the farm. All right man. Hang on a sec. And he's throwing

25:10.540 --> 25:15.660
on a cargo shorts that have a lot of pockets. These are, these are the cargoiest of cargo

25:15.660 --> 25:20.700
shorts. He's a real camera man. Shorts. These are real camera man shorts and he's grabbing,

25:21.260 --> 25:26.300
first he grabs the leftover energy drink that's sitting on his desk and he takes a big swig of it

25:26.300 --> 25:29.820
and realizes that it was from like five days ago and that wasn't the one he was drinking last

25:29.820 --> 25:36.060
night. At least it wasn't one of the piss jugs. Also, I love that you know the difference in

25:36.060 --> 25:42.300
tastes between a one day old energy drink and a five day old energy drink. Well, three days is the

25:42.380 --> 25:46.220
perfectly aged Gatorade. He wipes the film off his teeth.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.820
Yeah, that's an old one. And loads it into his camera.

25:56.620 --> 26:00.540
Amongst this chaos though, you do see that like the computer desk that's strewn with

26:00.540 --> 26:04.460
energy drinks and stuff, it's got the computer monitors and stuff. The actual computer monitors

26:04.460 --> 26:09.580
and desk and stuff are impressive. It's a good high quality setup and kind of over in a corner

26:09.580 --> 26:13.900
is where he keeps his camera equipment and it's the cleanest part of the house and he grabs two

26:13.900 --> 26:19.100
cases. One's got the camera and one's got all of his accoutrement and he grabs a tripod and gets

26:19.100 --> 26:22.860
it up under his arm and it's all a little disheveled as he's walking toward you. Alright

26:22.860 --> 26:28.620
man, let's get going. Julius is already kind of overwhelmed with the day and just kind of

26:28.620 --> 26:33.180
180s and heads back to the van. On the way out, he tries to get everything under one arm so he

26:33.180 --> 26:39.180
can grab his lucky blue baseball cap, puts it on his head and meets you guys in the van. Hey, Cal!

26:39.180 --> 26:44.300
Good morning, Beck. Good to see you, man! It's always a pleasure. So, uh, what are we doing?

26:44.300 --> 26:49.740
We've got 90 seconds at the farm. You know where that is, right? Uh, the farm. I mean,

26:49.740 --> 26:55.020
there's a lot of, uh, which, uh, I mean... Which one comes to your mind first?

26:57.020 --> 27:04.540
The O'Carney Farm. Okay, let's get us there. Let's go. You, uh, you want me to drive?

27:04.540 --> 27:15.660
Do you? He's got bloodshot eyes in it. Do you, uh, you want me to drive? I am actually good. Cal,

27:15.660 --> 27:20.780
could you open the glove box? Cal is, like, kind of looking over his script and not really paying

27:20.780 --> 27:27.820
attention and he's like, Beck is a fine driver. He would be an admirable choice. Julius opens the

27:27.820 --> 27:33.820
glove box and he has some, like, cool, like, flame striped racing gloves in there and he puts those

27:33.820 --> 27:43.260
on. He's like, I'm good. Cal raises a huge eye at those gloves. Just one? Eyebrow. Oh,

27:44.300 --> 27:49.900
I thought he pulled his eye out, raised it into the air. Cal plucks his eye out of the socket

27:49.900 --> 27:55.580
and raises it up closer to the steering wheel so he can get a good peek at Julius's sweet gloves.

27:56.140 --> 28:00.140
Pedal to the metal for, like, two seconds and then, like, starts going the speed limit to the farm.

28:01.100 --> 28:07.180
You peel out into a slo-mo. Into, like, a 35-40. Into a school zone.

28:07.180 --> 28:12.220
Okay, you know that the O'Carney Farm is only a few miles out of town. Just a few mile markers

28:12.220 --> 28:17.260
off the highway right outside of town. You're gonna hit a country road and then head off on a

28:17.260 --> 28:25.740
two-lane farm road that, uh, shockingly has farms on either side of it. As you head down,

28:25.740 --> 28:30.860
you see that the O'Carney Farm has a bunch of trucks and cars parked on the grass up by the

28:30.860 --> 28:38.540
house, uh, and then to the left you see a, uh, a very quiet farm. Far, far less. Is it a bio-farm?

28:40.220 --> 28:43.100
Are you gonna hit me with that every time I do this?

28:45.020 --> 28:47.900
Well, it doesn't make any sense because I edited out my stupidity earlier.

28:49.900 --> 28:54.140
No, it's there. You make me sound like the idiot. You just sound like you're genuinely asking,

28:54.220 --> 28:59.580
oh, is it a bio-farm? On the left there's a really quiet farm. There's just one pickup truck hanging

28:59.580 --> 29:04.540
out there. No one's out and about currently. And then on the right you see a farm, which is,

29:04.540 --> 29:08.460
yeah, the O'Carney one, but it has a bunch of cars and trucks pulled up by the house.

29:08.460 --> 29:11.580
More, more cars and trucks than should be pulled up at a farmhouse?

29:11.580 --> 29:15.420
Oh yeah, I'm talking 30 cars and trucks up in front of this. Sorry.

29:15.980 --> 29:21.500
On the way here, Beck has been putting together his camera equipment and he is now filming B-Roll

29:21.500 --> 29:25.340
out the window. Awesome. I don't know if I should say it every time, but he, that's one of his

29:25.340 --> 29:29.980
things is he's always filming. So think of that when you think of Beck. Think of that when you

29:29.980 --> 29:35.340
think of Beck. Julius tries to pull the van up as close as possible to like where he thinks

29:35.980 --> 29:44.540
a farmer would be. Do you see anybody standing with a pitchfork anywhere?

29:44.540 --> 29:52.940
It's a nice long gravel road up to this farmhouse and parked in the grass. There are like upwards

29:52.940 --> 29:59.340
of 30, maybe even 40 cars and trucks all haphazardly parked, but nice enough to where

29:59.340 --> 30:05.020
no one is blocking anyone else in. As you guys approach, you see that there is a folding table

30:05.020 --> 30:13.500
to the right of the farmhouse. And there is a man who is dressed to the farmer nines standing

30:13.500 --> 30:21.260
behind it with a metal box in front of him with the lid wide open. He is very much a farmer,

30:21.260 --> 30:28.220
what with overalls and a big straw hat, but you also see that he is wearing a full face mask,

30:28.940 --> 30:34.380
like a luchador. Is it like crazy and fancy like a luchador mask or is it like... Yeah, it's got

30:34.380 --> 30:41.180
corn all over it. For real? Yeah, it's like a corn-based luchador. Cartoon or realistic

30:41.260 --> 30:47.180
depictions of corn? Let's go cartoon. Faces or just cartoony like clipart? Oh, it's just corn.

30:47.180 --> 30:54.460
Faces? Like corn with faces. Is it corn people? Legitimately, my question is, was it a corn with

30:54.460 --> 31:03.740
a face and arms and legs, a corn person? Oh, fuck. No, I like the thing I said. Corn-based

31:03.740 --> 31:09.500
luchador mask. That's dope. Lots of kernels. And as you pull up, he's giving you a nice

31:09.500 --> 31:16.700
friendly wave. I throw it in the park and I jump out. We're with CAN Action News. I guess I don't

31:16.700 --> 31:23.820
have to say Action News because CAN stands for City Action News. Yes, I do. See that by the name

31:23.820 --> 31:31.740
on the side of your van. Sir, could we borrow you for about 90 seconds? Welcome to Farm Wrestling.

31:31.740 --> 31:38.700
Come on down. It's going to be a $5 entrance for each of you to see some Farm Wrestling. I'm the

31:38.700 --> 31:46.060
tiller, which is funny for two reasons. One, I till the ground and till my opponent into the

31:46.060 --> 31:56.060
ground. And two, I also fill up this till here with your $5. The tiller. I turn around and look

31:56.060 --> 32:02.380
at Beck and Cal. Guys, I heard about this in college. I didn't think it was real. Farm Wrestling.

32:03.420 --> 32:08.380
Beck is balancing the camera on his shoulder and trying to reach for a wallet in the cargo pants

32:08.380 --> 32:14.460
because he's got to get that $5 out. Cal is motioning to Beck to put his wallet away while

32:14.460 --> 32:21.180
he's just saying, a big black bug bit a big black bear. A big black bug bit a big black bear. Wow,

32:21.180 --> 32:30.060
you nailed those. Julius turns back around to the tiller and hands him the CAN card. Oh, yes,

32:30.060 --> 32:34.540
of course. And he pulls out his cell phone and attaches a little square on the bottom of it,

32:34.540 --> 32:41.340
swipes and is like $15. You want to add a tip for the tiller? He looks at his companions.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.700
It's crazy that you handed him a business card and he ran it.

32:46.940 --> 32:49.980
Oh, it was a business card. No, I meant the credit card.

32:49.980 --> 32:54.620
Oh, so you and I were on the same page. Why are we paying to cover your Farm Wrestling?

32:54.620 --> 32:58.540
I don't know what you're here for. I thought you wanted to watch some Farm Wrestling.

32:59.260 --> 33:05.260
No, no tip. Yeah, no one else did either, but it's worth a shot.

33:10.140 --> 33:15.340
All right, welcome and enjoy your time inside. It's right around the back there.

33:15.340 --> 33:17.580
Are you the owner? No, I'm the tiller.

33:20.620 --> 33:26.300
You want to talk to Mario, call me if you want to talk to the owner and the real farmer of this

33:26.380 --> 33:29.900
here farm. As he's saying that I'm kind of elbowing you and pointing at Mario.

33:30.940 --> 33:34.780
From what I've seen, it's her. She's the Okarni that I know of.

33:34.780 --> 33:39.740
Which is an old lady with blown out and dyed hair wearing an American gladiator

33:39.740 --> 33:42.700
t-shirt with the sleeves cut off. Nice.

33:42.700 --> 33:46.940
She seems to be in her mid-50s, maybe up to 60s. You're not quite sure.

33:46.940 --> 33:50.220
Big old shout out to Curtis from Deez Moneys,

33:50.220 --> 33:57.580
Iowa. A patron at the $10 or up level on patreon.com slash pretending pod for suggesting

33:58.380 --> 34:02.700
a backyard wrestling arena. Thank you, Curtis.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.940
Ma'am, did you hear what I asked the tiller? Oh, sorry. What are you guys here for?

34:06.940 --> 34:10.460
Do you have 90 seconds to talk about the farm? As this conversation is happening,

34:10.460 --> 34:14.220
Beck is going to already start setting up a tripod to see if he can get a good angle

34:14.220 --> 34:17.900
of her just standing here. We don't even need to go anywhere in his eyes.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.220
What is this for? City Action News.

34:20.220 --> 34:24.140
Oh, yeah. And what would you like to talk about my farm for on the news?

34:24.140 --> 34:31.420
Well, I'd like to save the specific questions for later, but it's about the company.

34:31.420 --> 34:34.940
Fucking godels. Guys, I set it up. I think this is going to be good.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.820
Beck is approaching her and attaching a lapel mic to her.

34:38.460 --> 34:41.980
Would you mind just saying her name and spelling it for me?

34:41.980 --> 34:51.980
Marielle O'Carney. Marielle, M-A-R-I-E-L-O-K-E-A-R-N-E-Y. Marielle O'Carney.

34:52.620 --> 34:58.460
And she takes a massive swig from the bottle of Jim Beam that she had in her hand.

34:58.460 --> 35:02.460
Nice. And then I just attach a lapel mic to Kal, but we've done this a thousand times.

35:02.460 --> 35:03.740
We don't even need to communicate.

35:03.740 --> 35:05.580
Kal is combing his hair as you do that.

35:05.580 --> 35:06.220
Yeah, there you go.

35:06.940 --> 35:10.940
Julius is like, thanks, ma'am, and grabs the bottle out of her hand and just kind of walks

35:11.420 --> 35:14.620
inside of the camera. She accepts.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.580
And like, as I'm walking off, I kind of like point her at the camera.

35:18.140 --> 35:23.340
I go behind the camera and I'll do a, I'll go to you with a silently, a five, four.

35:25.900 --> 35:29.820
I'm here at the O'Carney farm. Not many trains come by through.

35:35.580 --> 35:38.140
Hey guys, fuck it. Let's cut it again.

35:38.140 --> 35:41.180
Hold on. I'm sorry.

35:42.780 --> 35:43.580
Got a piss.

35:43.580 --> 35:45.180
We're doing a lot of pissing.

35:45.180 --> 35:48.460
That's what we're good for here. An old P-T-B-P.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.340
Stands for pissing.

35:52.460 --> 35:55.820
We're, uh, we're going one at a time. I just decided that.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.380
Pissing.

35:56.380 --> 35:56.940
Pissing.

35:56.940 --> 35:58.460
The best piss.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.300
Pissing the best piss.

36:02.300 --> 36:03.420
Pissing the best piss.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.100
Farm wrestling.

36:08.140 --> 36:13.100
That's one of the words that you use to warm up.

36:13.100 --> 36:13.600
Yeah.

36:14.780 --> 36:17.500
Cal, I love it too, but that's not why we're here.

36:19.020 --> 36:21.580
I'm here at the old O'Carney farm.

36:21.580 --> 36:26.380
Muriel O'Carney has been running this place with her family for four generations.

36:26.940 --> 36:31.100
But now, thanks to changing times, she's forced to do the unthinkable.

36:31.740 --> 36:36.700
She hosts violent combats on her property just to make ends meet.

36:36.700 --> 36:40.540
Muriel, when did these farm wrestling matches begin?

36:40.540 --> 36:47.020
I wanted these men to all meet each other and have a nice place to wrestle for fun.

36:47.020 --> 36:53.260
My son, Mitch, is a big fan of wrestling and he loves his wrestling mask.

36:53.260 --> 37:00.540
He actually, he loves his wrestling mask so much at a young age, he started having sex with it.

37:00.540 --> 37:06.780
And then eventually, the mask actually became pregnant and had a baby.

37:08.140 --> 37:12.060
I didn't even know he was fucking his mask, but now it's apparent.

37:12.940 --> 37:17.900
Cal is a professional, so he's kind of like motioning to his crew like,

37:17.900 --> 37:19.980
we gotta cut all this, we gotta cut all this.

37:19.980 --> 37:24.860
In the footage, you would see that the camera dips down kind of wildly when she dropped the curse word.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.420
It's pointed at the ground right now.

37:27.420 --> 37:32.540
She's kind of like laughing to herself and her eye is kind of like twitching a little bit.

37:32.540 --> 37:36.780
You can tell that she is intoxicated, even though she's very good at holding her liquor.

37:38.540 --> 37:41.980
Muriel, maybe we steer more towards the Godel company.

37:42.540 --> 37:43.580
Yeah, okay.

37:43.580 --> 37:47.180
The camera comes back up and he gives you another quick count in, it starts at three.

37:47.180 --> 37:52.300
And ma'am, my producer didn't mention it, but you should probably watch the language.

37:52.300 --> 37:55.500
Oh yes, so sorry, sir, Mr. Colorado.

37:56.060 --> 37:57.020
Oh, a fan.

37:57.020 --> 37:59.100
Yeah, good to see you on top still.

37:59.980 --> 38:03.260
A pretty sharp pained look comes across Cal's face.

38:03.820 --> 38:06.860
It's quickly replaced by a professional smile.

38:06.860 --> 38:12.860
And he says, Muriel, many local farmers are selling out their land to the Godel company,

38:12.860 --> 38:14.700
a major player in agribusiness.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.860
You are one of the last holdouts in the area.

38:16.860 --> 38:17.740
What keeps you here?

38:19.500 --> 38:23.420
For that, I guess I'd have to walk you back if you'd like.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.380
Come on back here.

38:24.380 --> 38:29.260
And she kind of motions the camera and you as well toward the back of the farmhouse.

38:29.260 --> 38:32.860
Beck goes ahead and takes the camera off the tripod, but he's following your guys's lead.

38:33.580 --> 38:35.980
Cal Colorado is going to stay in the frame no matter what he does.

38:35.980 --> 38:40.220
Come with us as we explore a vanishing lifestyle in this America.

38:40.220 --> 38:44.860
As you guys pass around the back of the farmhouse, you see that there is a tarp

38:45.500 --> 38:52.300
strewn over the back door as a makeshift tunnel for wrestlers to make their entrances.

38:52.380 --> 38:59.900
And there is a farm DIY wrestling ring set up right near this tarped tunnel

38:59.900 --> 39:08.940
in which there is a wrestler dressed as a crab, also wearing a luchador mask with the sign of,

39:09.820 --> 39:12.300
I don't know, the cancer sign for...

39:12.300 --> 39:13.740
Which one's the 69?

39:13.740 --> 39:14.540
That's the one.

39:14.540 --> 39:16.860
He's got a big old 69 on his face, I guess.

39:16.860 --> 39:17.500
Gemini, right?

39:17.500 --> 39:18.220
Oh, wait, what?

39:18.220 --> 39:19.260
I thought that was the crab.

39:19.260 --> 39:20.860
Well, one's his moon, one's his son.

39:20.860 --> 39:22.220
Oh, I hate it.

39:22.220 --> 39:24.540
I don't know what any of it is.

39:24.540 --> 39:26.140
Yeah, cancer is the 69.

39:27.980 --> 39:28.620
Oh, nice.

39:28.620 --> 39:29.420
Yeah, cut me out.

39:31.100 --> 39:36.380
So on the mask, the 69 is around the two eyes, but besides that, fully dressed as a crab,

39:36.380 --> 39:38.540
even including claws on his hands.

39:38.540 --> 39:43.420
The other wrestler is extremely patriotic, just stars and stripes all the way through.

39:43.980 --> 39:50.220
And she leads you back there and she yells out to this crowd of 50 to 80 people.

39:51.020 --> 39:53.980
What do you guys think about the Godel company?

39:55.180 --> 39:59.900
The entire crowd turns and looks at Mariel with reverence.

40:00.700 --> 40:01.980
They all start chanting.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.020
Fuck Fred Godel!

40:06.940 --> 40:08.620
Fuck Fred Godel!

40:10.380 --> 40:11.980
Fuck Fred Godel!

40:14.540 --> 40:17.740
I'm looking at Beck and I'm like, stoked, just stoked.

40:17.900 --> 40:21.420
Beck is doing a panning shot of all the crowd.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.860
And then toward the end of the panning shot, he's getting really up close to one of the

40:24.860 --> 40:30.300
more vehement, sweaty, spittle, coming out of the mouth shots of a person who's just

40:30.300 --> 40:31.900
red-faced and angry yelling this.

40:31.900 --> 40:32.380
Oh, yeah.

40:32.380 --> 40:39.020
And she's got pigtails on the top of her head on either side, and she's just screaming

40:39.020 --> 40:43.420
into the camera, Fuck Fred Godel!

40:43.420 --> 40:48.380
So I would say that's what I think about the Godel company.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.220
Powerful words.

40:50.220 --> 40:53.740
Beck hears that she is now talking again on his headphones, that he's always got around

40:53.740 --> 40:55.660
his neck at the least, but they're on his ears at this point.

40:55.660 --> 40:58.780
So he whips back around to get her in frame with Cal.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.700
What do you think about that, Cal?

41:01.660 --> 41:03.260
I'm not paid to think, ma'am.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.540
I'm paid to report.

41:04.540 --> 41:06.780
Well, did we give you what you need?

41:06.780 --> 41:08.060
Oh shit, 90 seconds.

41:08.620 --> 41:09.980
Wrap it up, wrap it up.

41:09.980 --> 41:16.860
No, very little of what you presented to us here today is usable or fit for network television.

41:16.860 --> 41:17.420
Did you pay?

41:18.220 --> 41:18.700
Yes.

41:18.700 --> 41:21.260
Well, you're free to stick around if you want to.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.420
And she walks back to the wrestling ring.

41:23.420 --> 41:26.860
The camera more focuses on you and starts to zoom a little.

41:26.860 --> 41:31.820
A confusing scene here in the countryside outside the city, at once a mix of vibrant

41:32.380 --> 41:33.100
folk culture.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.220
Where does he want to go with this?

41:36.460 --> 41:40.780
I mean, you don't have a teleprompter here.

41:40.780 --> 41:44.620
So give me some outlines so I can script some of these in advance.

41:45.820 --> 41:46.860
What we're going to be doing.

41:46.860 --> 41:49.660
If I'm being honest, I had no idea this was going to happen.

41:49.660 --> 41:51.580
Oh, you didn't know we were going to farm wrestling?

41:51.580 --> 41:52.860
No, I knew you were going to farm wrestling.

41:52.860 --> 41:54.780
I had no idea they were going to be so abrasive.

41:56.860 --> 41:57.820
That was your call.

41:57.820 --> 41:58.620
Yeah, it felt right.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.380
Doesn't mean I planned it.

42:02.940 --> 42:04.140
Anything for it.

42:04.140 --> 42:07.500
You guys are going to be a news crew and you're going to go and interview people, but they

42:07.500 --> 42:08.460
don't want to be interviewed.

42:09.980 --> 42:12.700
That actually, that actually is what, what Cal addresses.

42:12.700 --> 42:18.220
He, he motions to Beck to like put the camera down and he, he approaches like Muriel without

42:18.220 --> 42:18.940
the microphone.

42:19.740 --> 42:23.740
Ma'am, you have an opportunity to get your side of the story out today.

42:23.740 --> 42:31.100
Now, so far with the profanity and well, frankly, a lot of those men are covered in blood.

42:31.100 --> 42:32.940
We can't show that on our family network.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.980
Do you want to give us something we can use?

42:36.620 --> 42:41.580
She sighs and I'd like you to roll persuade.

42:41.580 --> 42:43.100
First roll.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.180
First roll of the second season.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.660
It's an 86.

42:51.100 --> 42:55.740
He has an 80 persuade, but he doesn't quite make it.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.580
Well, let's talk about luck real quick.

42:57.580 --> 43:03.420
I have given you each a one point of luck to start this campaign with.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.980
And when I say point, I mean that you have luck.

43:06.700 --> 43:10.700
We are doing luck in a slightly different way than we've played in the past.

43:10.700 --> 43:15.820
So it might take us a little bit to remember it all, but you either have luck in this game

43:15.820 --> 43:18.060
or you do not have luck in this game.

43:18.060 --> 43:24.860
If you do have luck, then when you roll after you've rolled, if you would like to use your

43:24.860 --> 43:29.820
luck, you can switch your tens dice and your what's the other one called?

43:29.820 --> 43:30.540
Hundreds.

43:30.540 --> 43:32.620
No, single single.

43:32.620 --> 43:33.260
Singles.

43:33.260 --> 43:34.380
Your ones dice.

43:34.380 --> 43:39.580
You can switch the tens and the singles dice in order to perhaps create a success.

43:40.140 --> 43:47.020
In this situation, the 86 would indeed turn into a 68 and that would lend itself to a success.

43:47.020 --> 43:53.180
Also, I will be giving luck for sweet character play and moments.

43:53.260 --> 43:55.660
Please ask me for luck if I don't give it to you.

43:56.860 --> 43:58.300
And the kissing thing, right?

43:58.300 --> 43:59.580
You told us about the kissing thing.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.900
That if we gave you a kiss after the session, you'd give us our luck back.

44:05.900 --> 44:07.580
And what did I say about that kiss, Joe?

44:07.580 --> 44:08.300
It had to be good.

44:09.740 --> 44:10.540
It had to be sweet.

44:12.540 --> 44:13.100
Tonguey.

44:13.100 --> 44:14.940
He said sweet like cherry pie, I think.

44:14.940 --> 44:23.500
So that's a pretty easy way to do it.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.740
I was banking on that because I did that anyway.

44:25.740 --> 44:27.500
I had a garlicky breakfast.

44:29.020 --> 44:32.780
It's unfortunate you did that, Joe, because you did already have the luck starting out.

44:32.780 --> 44:35.820
So just think of it as practice.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.340
A wasted sweet little kiss.

44:39.500 --> 44:40.220
It wasn't wasted on me.

44:40.220 --> 44:42.700
I'm going to spend that luck, turn that into a 68.

44:42.700 --> 44:50.940
As Cal sees his words fall flat, he just gives her a huge wink with his piercing blue eyes.

44:53.660 --> 44:56.940
The animal magnetism switches something in her brain.

44:56.940 --> 44:58.220
That's the Cal I know.

45:00.060 --> 45:01.500
Cal can be on top.

45:01.500 --> 45:02.860
And she looks up at you.

45:02.860 --> 45:03.360
Again.

45:04.700 --> 45:05.340
Damn it, Cal.

45:06.540 --> 45:08.700
I miss you being the anchor, Cam.

45:08.700 --> 45:10.380
I do too, Mrs. O'Carney.

45:10.380 --> 45:13.820
All right, well, let's go over here with a nice shot of the farm in the background

45:13.820 --> 45:16.220
and say something nice for the people, huh?

45:16.220 --> 45:17.660
I would surely appreciate that.

45:21.420 --> 45:26.060
Beck follows her lead and he notices that she's got a good eye for what is pretty on her farm.

45:26.060 --> 45:28.940
She set herself up in a good spot with rolling fields behind her.

45:30.220 --> 45:32.940
The edge of the farmhouse is there to get a sense of perspective.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.340
She set up a nice shot and I follow her lead.

45:35.340 --> 45:37.660
The corn is swaying in the breeze.

45:37.660 --> 45:38.940
Crabs are walking by.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.780
It's a corn and crab farm.

45:43.340 --> 45:43.840
Right.

45:44.460 --> 45:46.940
That's why the wrestlers were corn and crab guys.

45:48.620 --> 45:53.500
I'm not selling my damn farm to no Godel.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.860
All right, let's do this.

45:54.860 --> 45:56.060
Mariel O'Carney.

45:56.060 --> 45:58.620
This farm has been in your family for four generations.

45:59.260 --> 46:03.420
The Godel company has been purchasing many of your neighbor's properties.

46:03.420 --> 46:05.260
You are the last holdout in the area.

46:05.900 --> 46:07.020
What keeps you here?

46:07.020 --> 46:09.580
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Cal.

46:09.580 --> 46:17.660
I don't appreciate someone who has been given everything that they have coming in

46:17.660 --> 46:25.820
and trying to use that privilege to buy up what is rightfully mine

46:25.820 --> 46:30.140
and has been, like you said, in my family for four generations.

46:30.940 --> 46:35.340
I am not going to sell to Fred Godel because I do not trust him.

46:35.340 --> 46:38.060
I think he is a snake of a businessman

46:38.060 --> 46:43.180
and I think he is bad for both the economy and the world at large.

46:43.180 --> 46:44.460
Kind of leans in and he's like,

46:44.460 --> 46:49.420
could you just say the Godel corporation instead of Frank Godel?

46:49.420 --> 46:53.980
Well, Frank is Fred's dad who actually put in the work.

46:54.700 --> 46:57.500
I would respect it if Frank was around,

46:57.500 --> 47:02.140
but he's no longer mentally capable to run the Godel company,

47:03.020 --> 47:07.180
which is why his idiot son has taken over.

47:07.180 --> 47:08.700
Sorry, I'll do that again.

47:09.740 --> 47:12.780
I don't want to sell my land to the Godel company

47:12.780 --> 47:14.700
because they are ruining America.

47:15.260 --> 47:17.260
As she stares straight down the camera.

47:18.300 --> 47:20.620
How are they ruining America?

47:20.620 --> 47:25.580
In my opinion, they are taking the ability to make a living for oneself

47:25.580 --> 47:30.860
out of the hands of those of us who have been doing the living for ourselves for generations

47:30.860 --> 47:32.780
and feeding America.

47:32.780 --> 47:38.300
Are you comfortable, Cal, with one person being in charge of feeding America?

47:38.300 --> 47:41.740
Julius is doing the wrap this up, don't answer that.

47:43.820 --> 47:45.500
No, Cal was never going to answer that.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.860
Are you dodging the question, Cal?

47:47.420 --> 47:48.620
Are you not here for the truth?

47:49.260 --> 47:51.180
Ma'am, I am only here for the truth,

47:51.180 --> 47:54.140
but I'm not the one who answers the questions.

47:54.700 --> 47:58.300
I ask the questions and the people seem to think I do a pretty good job.

47:59.580 --> 48:00.780
Can I ask you a question?

48:01.180 --> 48:03.420
Yeah, Colorado, you can ask me a question.

48:05.980 --> 48:07.740
Hold on, I got to think of a question now.

48:07.740 --> 48:11.660
I was going to mention, ask her opinion on her neighbors selling their land.

48:11.660 --> 48:13.100
Does she fault them for it?

48:13.100 --> 48:14.060
Great question.

48:14.060 --> 48:17.340
And maybe even why she thinks that they sold, that kind of thing.

48:17.340 --> 48:17.840
Yeah.

48:18.300 --> 48:21.820
Do you fault your neighbors who have already sold to the Godel company?

48:21.820 --> 48:22.460
Good question.

48:26.140 --> 48:26.860
Hey, thanks, Zach.

48:26.860 --> 48:32.780
No, unfortunately I don't.

48:33.740 --> 48:34.860
It's none of my business.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.340
They can do with their land what they want to do.

48:37.340 --> 48:39.420
I'm going to do it my land, what I want to do.

48:39.420 --> 48:40.620
Are any of them here today?

48:41.340 --> 48:41.840
Yeah.

48:42.540 --> 48:45.820
And she points over at one of the guys watching the match.

48:46.700 --> 48:49.340
He's just dressed in like super normal clothes.

48:49.340 --> 48:50.540
He's car hearted out.

48:51.180 --> 48:53.020
That's a typhus.

48:53.980 --> 48:57.100
We already have typhus.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.060
Oh, sorry.

48:58.060 --> 48:58.940
Typhoid barge.

49:00.620 --> 49:02.540
We're playing Star Wars, right?

49:02.540 --> 49:03.040
Exactly.

49:06.540 --> 49:07.660
Typhoid barge.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.620
Such a good Star Wars name.

49:10.620 --> 49:11.180
That's great.

49:11.980 --> 49:13.260
Cholera candlestick.

49:14.780 --> 49:15.740
Yeah, there's a...

49:15.740 --> 49:16.700
That's the lupus mcmanus.

49:18.940 --> 49:19.740
It's never lupus.

49:19.740 --> 49:21.580
Well, Jesse's over there.

49:22.460 --> 49:26.220
He sold the lemon farm like a week ago.

49:26.220 --> 49:29.020
Muriel, is there anything else you want the people to know?

49:29.020 --> 49:29.520
No.

49:30.060 --> 49:34.940
You are doing the wrap up thing you were saying earlier and Beck is doing the stretch out thing.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.060
Like kneading dough above your head.

49:40.060 --> 49:42.060
Pulling it out, pulling it outward.

49:42.060 --> 49:43.420
Oh yeah, that's not kneading.

49:43.420 --> 49:45.740
Julius goes around you to not get in the shot,

49:45.740 --> 49:49.500
but he goes over and is going to go talk to Mr. Lemon.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.220
Nice.

49:50.220 --> 49:53.420
As Julius Summers approaches, Jesse, Lemon.

49:58.540 --> 50:02.060
Wow, you'd go just not far outside the city and people get real country.

50:04.060 --> 50:05.500
Real fucking over the top.

50:06.220 --> 50:07.900
We're just over the train tracks.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.620
Did you hear that tiller guy?

50:12.220 --> 50:16.060
That tiller guy sounds like he fucking lives in the swamps in Louisiana.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.620
One of those contention hicks.

50:19.580 --> 50:22.220
As you guys are like making your way around,

50:22.220 --> 50:25.100
you hear him talking in his normal voice to someone.

50:27.500 --> 50:31.820
So anyway, I am called the tiller because not only do I till my soil,

50:31.820 --> 50:33.340
but I also control the till.

50:35.100 --> 50:36.060
Succinctly said.

50:36.620 --> 50:38.380
To which Jesse Lemon's response.

50:42.860 --> 50:45.980
You sure do control the shit out of that till tiller.

50:46.860 --> 50:47.740
Yee-haw.

50:47.740 --> 50:48.540
Do you touch him?

50:49.180 --> 50:49.500
Sorry.

50:53.820 --> 50:55.180
That's a leading question.

50:56.140 --> 50:59.020
How do you approach Jesse Lemon?

51:00.060 --> 51:00.780
Do you touch him?

51:00.780 --> 51:01.500
Do you touch him?

51:02.540 --> 51:03.100
Objection.

51:04.300 --> 51:04.860
Leading the win.

51:04.860 --> 51:06.860
As you caress the small of his back.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.420
You walk up behind him and blow on his neck.

51:11.420 --> 51:16.700
Big circle, little circle, question mark dot.

51:17.340 --> 51:17.980
Open up.

51:17.980 --> 51:19.100
Did you guys ever do that?

51:19.100 --> 51:21.340
Was it make the chills happen on the back of somebody?

51:22.140 --> 51:23.020
Carry on Luke.

51:23.020 --> 51:25.340
I didn't know if that was like your alphabet trick for eating pussy.

51:26.700 --> 51:29.900
Big circle, little circle, question mark dot.

51:36.300 --> 51:38.380
Julius walks up to Jesse Lemon.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.180
He tries to whistle, but he can't.

51:41.180 --> 51:46.380
Julius is like super intrigued by the like wrestling match.

51:46.380 --> 51:49.820
So he walks up to Lemon and what are these guys' names?

51:51.660 --> 51:55.100
We got miss cap and crustacean down there.

51:55.100 --> 51:58.060
And cousin Sam.

51:58.060 --> 51:59.020
And cousin Sam.

52:01.020 --> 52:03.660
We got cap and crustacean versus cousin Sam.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.740
Sir, what do you like to be on TV?

52:05.740 --> 52:07.660
Oh, about what now?

52:07.660 --> 52:11.020
I hear that you recently came in to a lot of money.

52:11.180 --> 52:13.100
And that's what you would like to talk to me about?

52:13.100 --> 52:15.980
Well, specifically, the decision to do that.

52:16.860 --> 52:17.900
I said a lot of money.

52:17.900 --> 52:19.260
What do I need to tell you about?

52:19.260 --> 52:20.540
I made a lot of money.

52:20.540 --> 52:22.940
Cal will be asking you some questions.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.860
Cal reaches out and spits you with a shake.

52:24.860 --> 52:27.100
Cal Coran!

52:27.100 --> 52:30.700
And he spits in his hand and then shakes with his other one.

52:30.700 --> 52:34.300
He spits in his left hand and shakes you with his right hand like a normal person.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.900
Cal gamely spits in his left hand and shakes.

52:38.140 --> 52:39.820
Yeah, that's sick!

52:40.860 --> 52:42.460
Because he's got the personal touch.

52:42.460 --> 52:44.780
Beck has got the camera set up and he's lapeled you.

52:44.780 --> 52:47.820
And if I could just get you to say and spell your name, please.

52:47.820 --> 52:53.260
Yeah, that's right, J-C-D-E-A-J-C, Lemon, spelled like a fruit.

52:53.260 --> 52:57.180
I like to think that the background is literally just the wrestling ring.

52:57.180 --> 52:57.980
Oh, yeah.

52:57.980 --> 52:59.020
Yeah, that's good.

52:59.020 --> 53:00.860
He's already looking at the camera and he's like,

53:00.860 --> 53:07.580
I sold all my property for a whole lot of money.

53:07.900 --> 53:09.100
To the God Company!

53:09.100 --> 53:10.300
Thank you, God Company!

53:10.860 --> 53:14.540
Beck, after he lets him finish and then says to him,

53:14.540 --> 53:17.500
if you'll address your questions to Cal there,

53:17.500 --> 53:19.180
he's the one that's going to be talking to you.

53:19.180 --> 53:20.620
You don't have to look down the barrel.

53:20.620 --> 53:24.140
Okay, before we start, making sure everybody's ready.

53:24.140 --> 53:25.100
Headphones on.

53:25.100 --> 53:27.580
Beck is momentarily like, fuck, do I have them on?

53:27.580 --> 53:30.780
And he goes and pats, yeah, we're good to go.

53:30.780 --> 53:31.260
Okay.

53:31.260 --> 53:37.100
Immediately, you see Jesse has a streak of terror run through

53:37.100 --> 53:40.860
his entire body, his face goes pale and he starts sweating

53:40.860 --> 53:47.100
as he's just staring at the headphones that are on the ears of Beck Wilder.

53:47.100 --> 53:48.860
Why did I bring up the headphones?

53:48.860 --> 53:55.820
Beck goes to swat at him, do I got something on me?

53:56.380 --> 53:57.740
Hey, bro, tell me what's going on.

53:57.740 --> 54:01.900
Every time you're touching him, he's just kind of like squirming as he's standing.

54:01.900 --> 54:03.820
It's like a physical reaction.

54:03.820 --> 54:06.380
Beck takes him fully off to look at him.

54:06.380 --> 54:08.940
As you're holding him closer, he backs up.

54:08.940 --> 54:13.900
Beck notes that and he just slowly puts them back onto his head

54:14.940 --> 54:17.820
and then does hands up like they're done.

54:17.820 --> 54:25.100
You see in Jesse's eyes that he is not aware of the terror that just struck across him.

54:25.100 --> 54:30.540
And he looks at Cal and he says, are you ready for an interview or what are we doing here?

54:30.540 --> 54:33.500
Mr. Lemon, do you have some issue with our equipment?

54:33.500 --> 54:35.180
Which part of the equipment?

54:35.180 --> 54:36.780
Beck's headphones?

54:36.780 --> 54:41.660
As you say the word headphones, he shudders to the point where he almost falls over

54:41.660 --> 54:43.900
and is like, wow, sorry about that.

54:43.900 --> 54:45.900
Yeah, Cal reaches out to steady him.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.940
I've been having a bit of drinking today, having some fun.

54:48.940 --> 54:51.660
It's Saturday afternoon straw.

54:51.660 --> 54:53.420
Can I human this reaction?

54:53.420 --> 54:53.980
Yeah, of course.

54:54.940 --> 54:56.780
64, which is a pass.

54:56.780 --> 54:59.980
It's a pass because you rolled under your skill of?

54:59.980 --> 55:00.460
70.

55:00.460 --> 55:01.260
Fantastic.

55:01.260 --> 55:08.140
And so as you pass, you see that there is a pure unconscious terror in this man

55:08.140 --> 55:13.660
directed toward headphones for some reason that he is not seemingly aware of.

55:13.660 --> 55:14.700
Yeah, well, we've all been there.

55:16.940 --> 55:19.100
Mine do have demon faces painted on the sides.

55:20.540 --> 55:21.580
Mr. Lemon.

55:21.580 --> 55:22.620
Name's Jesse.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.980
Thank you so much for having me.

55:25.020 --> 55:28.700
Tell us if you would, why you sold to the Godel company?

55:28.700 --> 55:35.740
Well, you offer me a lot of money and you don't see a Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos

55:35.740 --> 55:38.300
or a Fred Godel around very often.

55:38.300 --> 55:38.940
Now, do you?

55:38.940 --> 55:43.100
When it came to my property and made me do, I couldn't quite refuse you.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.060
Not good at that.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.740
What sort of deal did you make?

55:45.740 --> 55:48.060
Well, you offered me a whole lot of money.

55:48.060 --> 55:52.140
Not going to tell you how exactly much, but enough to where I was ready to sell pretty

55:52.140 --> 55:53.340
much merely.

55:53.340 --> 55:55.500
Between you and me, Mr. Lemon.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.700
How much money was it?

55:56.780 --> 56:00.220
Well over what it is worth, in my opinion.

56:00.220 --> 56:04.620
Was it well over what it was worth in a real estate assessor's opinion?

56:04.620 --> 56:08.380
My goodness, you are a very prickly fellow, are you not?

56:08.380 --> 56:10.060
When it comes to money, I will tell you.

56:10.060 --> 56:11.980
You seem like a nice man, I'll just tell you.

56:12.700 --> 56:17.820
My farm is roughly estimated to be worth about 1.2 million dollars.

56:17.820 --> 56:21.500
This man came into my own home and offered me 2.5.

56:21.500 --> 56:23.100
A generous offer to be sure.

56:23.180 --> 56:27.580
Indeed, it's enough for me to live off of for the rest of my life.

56:27.580 --> 56:29.020
If you invested wisely.

56:29.020 --> 56:30.060
Well, I doubt that.

56:33.180 --> 56:33.900
Fair enough, Mr. Lemon.

56:33.900 --> 56:37.980
My money don't go in no bank, my money don't go in no crypto.

56:37.980 --> 56:39.740
My money stays right with me.

56:39.740 --> 56:43.660
Julius Summers is trying to imagine how many jet skis this guy has bought.

56:45.260 --> 56:48.060
Is Julius Summers also thinking about how much crypto he could buy?

56:48.620 --> 56:49.900
2.5 million?

56:50.460 --> 56:53.340
And it's way more than he currently owns, which is still a lot.

56:54.780 --> 56:56.700
This is June 18th, it's not the past.

56:56.700 --> 56:59.260
Crypto is crashing right now.

56:59.260 --> 57:03.340
Right, he has deleted his crypto app off of his phone so that he doesn't look at it.

57:04.940 --> 57:06.140
Oh, is that a little...

57:06.140 --> 57:07.420
That's actually Luke.

57:07.420 --> 57:09.820
Is that a Luke detail?

57:09.820 --> 57:13.660
I diversify my portfolio across my pockets.

57:13.660 --> 57:16.300
Well, that is a folksy if impractical method.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.940
Do we have anything else we want to ask this guy?

57:19.660 --> 57:24.140
Does he have to leave or are they paying him to maintain the land now?

57:24.140 --> 57:25.500
As surfs.

57:25.500 --> 57:28.380
Mr. Lemon, what does the Godel company want with your land?

57:28.380 --> 57:30.380
Are you still on it or have you moved?

57:30.380 --> 57:33.580
He gave me about a month to get everything cleaned up.

57:33.580 --> 57:34.700
You see, I'm right over there.

57:34.700 --> 57:40.300
He points across the street where his old pickup truck is the only thing seen on his property.

57:40.300 --> 57:42.380
He's like, yeah, I'm just literally right there.

57:42.380 --> 57:45.980
So I'm just selling off all my equipment.

57:45.980 --> 57:48.540
They said they didn't want none of it, they just want the land.

57:48.620 --> 57:55.420
So I'm just selling everything else off and then I'm going to take off to who knows where, maybe Greece.

57:55.420 --> 57:58.620
Is there anything growing on the Lemon farm right now?

57:58.620 --> 57:58.860
No.

57:59.500 --> 58:01.740
No, it's not a crab in corn form.

58:02.380 --> 58:02.700
Damn.

58:04.460 --> 58:10.460
One of the crab tanks is broken and some of our carnies crabs are scuttling across the road.

58:10.460 --> 58:11.340
Some of them make it.

58:11.900 --> 58:12.860
Some of them frogger.

58:12.940 --> 58:18.620
Jesse Lemon's off to explore Greece.

58:18.620 --> 58:24.700
The Godel company gave me myself lemon and I'm going to go to Greece and make lemonade.

58:24.700 --> 58:25.260
That was rad.

58:26.060 --> 58:28.220
Bec's giving you like enthusiastic thumbs up.

58:28.220 --> 58:31.020
Yeah, Julius is doing the like, that was perfect.

58:31.020 --> 58:35.900
Cal is stoked that he said that and just says, Mr. Lemon, enjoy the wrestling.

58:35.900 --> 58:39.420
Cal, Colorado reporting from Okarni Farm.

58:39.420 --> 58:40.460
And we're out.

58:40.460 --> 58:56.220
Do you think you can edit that to 90 seconds?

59:10.460 --> 59:26.620
Jesse Lemon, how do you eat pussy?

59:26.620 --> 59:29.260
Question Mark Dye puts a little baby in a spiral.

59:30.860 --> 59:35.660
And I'm a big fan of Kendrick Lamar.

59:35.660 --> 59:38.380
Question Mark Dye puts baby in a spiral.

59:40.460 --> 59:44.220
Now all that pussy talk has to stay in.

59:46.220 --> 59:49.340
Not all of it.

59:49.340 --> 59:52.460
Just a taste.
