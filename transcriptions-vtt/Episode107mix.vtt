00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Welcome to the cream zone, my pastries.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
It's your putrid patissier, Papa Wolf the dog,

00:08.000 --> 00:11.620
and I am here to cover all the butter-filled dough

00:11.620 --> 00:15.420
in various sweet sauces of my choosing.

00:15.420 --> 00:18.760
I hope y'all like some sweet grease.

00:18.760 --> 00:23.760
I am rolling out that dough live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:24.260 --> 00:26.640
the only radio station that doubles

00:26.640 --> 00:29.440
as a bakery in the dream times.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.280
Now I know y'all know that I love kneading that dough,

00:33.280 --> 00:37.080
but what I really need is some external validation

00:37.080 --> 00:39.400
from the listeners of my show.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.200
I have a need to knead,

00:41.200 --> 00:44.980
but my need to be kneaded is so much greater.

00:44.980 --> 00:48.440
This howling with Wolf was sent in by Modern Cannabis

00:48.440 --> 00:50.700
from Grand Junction, Colorado,

00:50.700 --> 00:53.920
who tweeted about the show and tagged that pretending pod

00:53.920 --> 00:57.120
an equally meaningful and easy thing to do.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.120
He writes,

00:58.160 --> 01:00.720
Hey Wolf, the music you put out pleases

01:00.720 --> 01:02.800
the deepest depths of my soul.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.840
Keep spinning those great tunes

01:04.840 --> 01:08.000
and munching on the slimiest of fine foods.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.920
I hope those contention boys you keep telling us about

01:10.920 --> 01:13.960
manage to vacuum up all that nasty ooze

01:13.960 --> 01:15.760
I keep seeing out and about.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.520
And lastly, a shout out to the best playing group

01:19.520 --> 01:21.840
a fledgling keeper could ask for.

01:21.840 --> 01:26.240
Kyle, Lexi, and Moriah couldn't ask for a better group

01:26.240 --> 01:30.680
of funny, smart, and kind people to play with.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.920
Lots of love, Modern Cannabis.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.520
Well damn, thanks Modern Cannabis.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.720
It sounds like you got a good group of buddies there.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.980
I wish, I wish I had a couple of buddies

01:42.980 --> 01:45.120
that were funny, smart, and kind.

01:45.120 --> 01:50.120
All I got is my producer and my dog, Wolf the dog, the dog.

01:50.760 --> 01:54.800
My producer is a piece of shit and Wolf the dog, the dog

01:54.800 --> 01:57.280
merely tolerates my existence.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.280
Maybe one day I'll have a friend too.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.880
If you want to write up something for your pastry loving

02:02.880 --> 02:05.680
Wolf the howl, write up a five star review

02:05.680 --> 02:08.520
on Apple podcasts and send a screenshot

02:08.520 --> 02:11.120
to pretendingpod at gmail.com

02:11.120 --> 02:13.920
or just tag the show at pretending pod

02:13.920 --> 02:16.120
on Instagram or Twitter.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.120
In return, you can put words in my mouth.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.000
What a damn deal.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.860
And while you're using your fingers to peruse

02:23.860 --> 02:27.080
the unfathomable thing that is the internet,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.740
stop by the damn subreddit.

02:29.740 --> 02:32.880
Some kid named Luke shit posts there constantly

02:32.880 --> 02:35.640
with the finesse of an Olympic athlete.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.040
Or join us on the discord.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.460
The community is just as sweet as they are filthy.

02:41.460 --> 02:45.600
And if you want to trade currency for bonus content,

02:45.600 --> 02:49.300
check out patreon.com slash pretendingpod

02:49.300 --> 02:52.380
for 23 exclusive episodes.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.340
The newest one from an ongoing Delta green

02:55.340 --> 02:58.300
home brew campaign just dropped.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.380
And that wily PTBP crew continues on live

03:02.380 --> 03:05.100
in the den of sin this Friday night,

03:05.100 --> 03:08.940
August 20th at 9.30 PM central time.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.400
If I've said it once, I hope my producer saves the clip

03:12.400 --> 03:14.920
so he can just play that audio again.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.900
The links are in the damn show notes.

03:18.940 --> 03:22.620
Here at the end of this story, there's everything to lose.

03:22.620 --> 03:27.340
But no matter how gory, I'll be here with the news.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.740
Last time Keith bumped into Silas Cole,

03:30.740 --> 03:34.640
John had questions for his newest father figure

03:34.640 --> 03:38.540
and Clark accidentally unleashed the other worldly beast

03:38.540 --> 03:42.820
he's been freaking out about since episode 31.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.940
But hey, at least this horrifying behemoth

03:45.940 --> 03:48.220
is made of the dripping ooze that's plagued

03:48.260 --> 03:49.940
the groups every step.

03:49.940 --> 03:54.280
And also, thankfully, the incomprehensible monster

03:54.280 --> 03:58.040
is mounted by an anatomically upgraded assassin

03:58.040 --> 04:00.320
dressed as Fonzie that's controlled

04:00.320 --> 04:02.380
by an unnatural metal ball,

04:02.380 --> 04:05.600
hell bent on the destruction of humanity.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.060
So that's nice.

04:08.060 --> 04:10.820
Seems like a good time to take a hard look around

04:10.820 --> 04:13.920
and ask yourselves, what's your favorite bop

04:13.920 --> 04:16.580
with an open question as the title?

04:16.580 --> 04:18.780
And why is it Drag It In 3

04:18.780 --> 04:21.620
with What Kinda World Are You Livin' In?

04:21.620 --> 04:26.620
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

04:51.620 --> 04:56.620
["What Kinda World Are You Livin' In"]

05:01.660 --> 05:05.740
When Thomas dies, you'll get his podcast money.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.220
Can I have all your stuff and your points in the podcast?

05:09.220 --> 05:11.520
Oh, like my points in the podcast so far?

05:11.520 --> 05:15.340
Like, as far as the leaderboards go?

05:15.340 --> 05:17.140
Yes, the leaderboards that I have.

05:17.140 --> 05:17.980
You've never seen this whiteboard.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.420
The fans don't know about this,

05:19.420 --> 05:21.260
but there is a complicating scoring system

05:21.780 --> 05:23.340
that Zach uses to keep us funny.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.260
To keep you.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.540
And just to keep you.

05:27.540 --> 05:30.220
You know, just like working with any auteur,

05:30.220 --> 05:34.060
there's some give and take with working with Zach.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.920
He gotta give a little, and he takes a lot,

05:36.920 --> 05:39.780
and that's how you make art.

05:39.780 --> 05:44.780
So, you know, if that requires manipulating

05:44.860 --> 05:49.420
and breaking down your players until they,

05:49.420 --> 05:52.860
until they, you know, until they're not themselves anymore,

05:52.860 --> 05:55.340
they're just little balls of clay that you can mold.

05:55.340 --> 05:56.700
That's what Zach's done for us.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.900
You're all Jenna Maroney,

05:57.900 --> 06:00.040
and I'm the bad guy from Iron Man 2.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.260
Mickey Rooney?

06:02.260 --> 06:03.860
Or not Mickey Rooney.

06:03.860 --> 06:04.860
Wait, yeah?

06:04.860 --> 06:05.700
Mickey Rourke.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.540
No.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.380
Mickey Rourke?

06:07.380 --> 06:08.700
Mickey Rooney?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.220
Mickey Rooney?

06:10.220 --> 06:12.380
If all the Jenna Maroney, Mickey Rourke jokes

06:12.380 --> 06:13.580
were about Mickey Rooney,

06:13.580 --> 06:16.260
were about Mickey Rooney,

06:16.260 --> 06:17.900
that would elevate an already great bit.

06:17.900 --> 06:20.780
Wait, I think I just realized

06:20.780 --> 06:24.660
that they are about Mickey Rourke and not Mickey Rooney,

06:24.660 --> 06:26.620
which I was so confused by.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.660
Wow.

06:27.660 --> 06:28.500
Wow.

06:28.500 --> 06:32.500
I just finished rewatching 30 Rock 2, so that's hilarious.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.540
I've got a gripe to complain.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.340
And she's like, tell me more.

06:37.580 --> 06:40.240
What's up with iPhones today?

06:40.240 --> 06:43.460
Is that Mickey Rooney or is that Iago?

06:43.460 --> 06:44.380
That's more Mickey Rooney.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.900
Well, you went a little Gilbert.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.500
What's going on?

06:48.500 --> 06:49.340
What?

06:49.340 --> 06:50.160
All right, no.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.580
So when we started recording this campaign

06:55.580 --> 06:59.180
over three and a half years ago,

06:59.180 --> 07:01.780
did you expect these small town contention cops

07:01.780 --> 07:04.740
to end up fighting a partial Android dressed like Fonzie

07:04.740 --> 07:07.260
controlled by an unnatural metal ball consciousness

07:07.260 --> 07:10.140
that's riding an oozing shadowy ape kaiju

07:10.140 --> 07:12.120
in an alternate plane of existence

07:12.120 --> 07:14.260
as the future Messiah of a cult,

07:14.260 --> 07:16.320
the founder of contention slash inventor

07:16.600 --> 07:18.400
who created all these weird science items

07:18.400 --> 07:20.600
and one of those inventions itself

07:20.600 --> 07:22.800
in the body of its adopted father

07:22.800 --> 07:25.380
alongside that adopted father's brother

07:25.380 --> 07:28.720
who can burn people with his hands in reverse time itself?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.020
No, I thought it would be something a lot cooler.

07:32.020 --> 07:33.520
Probably like 10% of them.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.800
Well, I'm just gonna open up this little envelope

07:36.800 --> 07:39.720
that I made for myself at the beginning of all this.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.760
And yeah, all those predictions are written right down here.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.800
No, no, wait, Joe, show that to the camera.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.620
Here, hang on.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.920
You'll see I did write down,

07:50.920 --> 07:54.480
I thought her name was gonna be Mary Beth.

07:54.480 --> 07:58.480
I didn't write Rosemary, so I whiffed it on that one.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.840
Whiffed it on that one pretty bad.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.240
What did Beth stand for?

08:01.240 --> 08:05.120
Better entity, time heathen.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.160
Damn, Joe.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.000
That's really solid.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.320
Can time heathens be like the theme of our second season?

08:14.320 --> 08:15.720
Yeah, well, no,

08:15.720 --> 08:19.400
because I never wanna do time travel again, but.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.800
The name of our prog band?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.120
Yeah, time heathens fucking rules.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.360
I know time bandits has a special place

08:27.360 --> 08:28.320
in a lot of people's heart,

08:28.320 --> 08:30.480
but if that movie was called time heathens,

08:31.560 --> 08:32.400
I think it would be unbeatable.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.880
What about clock stoppers?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.400
That movie was great.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.400
Is that like when you like interrupt two people

08:38.400 --> 08:41.200
who are definitely gonna get it on?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.040
Wait, no.

08:42.040 --> 08:42.880
You said clock.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.120
That's cock blockers.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.000
Clock stoppers.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.080
Clock stoppers has the weirdest ratio of being so bad

08:52.080 --> 08:54.560
and being something I've thought about

08:54.560 --> 08:56.280
ever since I've seen that movie.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.160
Like the ability to stop time

08:58.160 --> 08:59.840
and what you can do with that. It's not a good movie,

08:59.840 --> 09:03.320
but like I've thought about it at least once a year

09:03.320 --> 09:06.040
since I've seen it, probably more often than not.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.280
Right?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.240
Have you guys seen Time Fuckers?

09:10.200 --> 09:13.240
Is that about the guys who fuck goobs?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.720
That's spice holes.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.680
Cilantro's.

09:23.960 --> 09:27.560
Time Fuckers is just about this dog.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.400
A dog?

09:30.800 --> 09:31.640
Cool.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.480
Right on.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.360
I just watched Back to the Future for the first time.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.200
Really?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.280
You know that was originally gonna be called Time Fuckers?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.320
That makes sense.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.920
I heard a fact today that I didn't verify,

09:47.920 --> 09:49.400
so I should probably check it

09:49.400 --> 09:51.160
before I spread misinformation,

09:51.160 --> 09:52.080
but I'm just gonna say it.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.640
Apparently, The Muppet Show,

09:54.640 --> 09:56.880
they made two pilots for that originally.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.800
And one of them was called

09:57.800 --> 10:01.720
The Muppets Sex and Drug Show or something like that.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.280
And I don't know if that meant that they were gonna go

10:03.280 --> 10:05.920
with an adult route for it, but that's what it was called.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.760
It was like, The Muppets Sex and Drugs.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.920
Or whether they were just gonna teach kids

10:09.920 --> 10:11.360
about sex and drugs.

10:12.800 --> 10:13.640
I don't know what the-

10:13.640 --> 10:15.600
Like a reverse dare program?

10:15.600 --> 10:18.640
This is a great scenario to introduce

10:18.640 --> 10:20.840
without having any of the background for it,

10:20.840 --> 10:23.040
because we can just wildly speculate

10:23.040 --> 10:25.040
until Luke ruins it by looking it up.

10:26.040 --> 10:26.880
Don't ruin it.

10:26.880 --> 10:27.720
Don't look it up yet.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.540
Don't ruin it.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.380
Don't talk to him.

10:29.380 --> 10:30.200
Don't talk to him.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.360
It's violence.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.200
Oh, even better.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.040
That's right, yeah.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.480
Okay, so is the pitch there that the network

10:35.920 --> 10:38.320
is like, give us two ideas for a show

10:38.320 --> 10:40.280
and they really wanna make The Muppets Show

10:40.280 --> 10:42.040
and they're like, I guess if we give them

10:42.040 --> 10:44.400
The Muppets Sex and Violence,

10:44.400 --> 10:46.340
they gotta make The Muppets Show.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.200
Oh my God, just thinking of like a Gritty.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.320
Like Gritty in the sex and violence show, yeah.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.040
Oh my God.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.560
I mean, Gritty is the epitome of sex and violence.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.360
Gritty is the ultimate villain of The Muppets.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.120
Or the hero.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.480
What about Gritty just as a detective in Philadelphia?

11:06.480 --> 11:08.040
Sex and violence.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.400
Gritty, sex and violence unit.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.260
Gritty, sex and violence.

11:12.640 --> 11:15.200
Yeah, SVU stands for sex and violence unit.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.240
Gritty, sex and violence unit.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.680
Gritty and his partner, Chris Maloney,

11:19.680 --> 11:22.300
have to take on the mean streets.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.240
Just fucking.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.800
Remember when everybody saw Chris Maloney's

11:26.800 --> 11:29.040
like ass in his pants a few months ago

11:29.040 --> 11:31.680
and that was trending all over the place?

11:31.680 --> 11:32.520
And people were like,

11:32.520 --> 11:34.320
why is Chris Maloney's ass so good?

11:34.320 --> 11:35.400
It makes sense.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.240
Google that.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.440
The man's got a rump.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.200
That guy has a great ass.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.660
He's got a real ass face.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.620
You know when you look at somebody's face

11:43.620 --> 11:45.620
and you can tell they got a nice dumper?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.440
That jawline looks like it shits.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.800
This is something I wanted to bring up.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.200
Somebody on the Discord, you said like,

11:55.200 --> 11:56.700
you know when you look at a person's face

11:56.700 --> 11:59.840
and you see what you want to see and not what's there?

11:59.840 --> 12:01.480
I don't know what that means.

12:02.120 --> 12:02.960
And one person was like,

12:02.960 --> 12:04.680
I wonder if Zach has a little face blindness.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.360
And I just wanted to know if that,

12:06.360 --> 12:07.880
do you think you do or?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.440
Yeah, it's a good point, Luke.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.600
Thanks.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.440
What?

12:17.580 --> 12:20.240
No, I just meant that when you are familiar

12:20.240 --> 12:22.920
with someone over time,

12:22.920 --> 12:26.000
you see them differently than I think that you would

12:26.000 --> 12:29.320
if you were just seeing them as a stranger on the street.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.160
I think that your perception of your relationship to them

12:32.160 --> 12:34.000
and the way that they've treated you

12:34.000 --> 12:35.100
and the way you've treated them

12:35.100 --> 12:37.320
and the way that you perceive their actions

12:37.320 --> 12:38.880
and the way other people perceive them

12:38.880 --> 12:41.480
changes the way that you view them physically.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.320
Yeah.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.480
That's where I disagree.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.320
Yeah, I know.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.280
It's just my opinion.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.120
And all of science backs me up.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.280
Right, right.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.840
It's just my factual opinion.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.040
I forgot about those studies that you forwarded me,

12:55.040 --> 12:56.360
which was like, hey, in the future,

12:56.360 --> 12:57.420
if you ever need to know,

12:57.420 --> 12:59.580
and Zach just sent me all these links

12:59.580 --> 13:02.940
that were clearly to like crudely handmade websites,

13:02.940 --> 13:06.260
but it was like University of Florida study confirms.

13:06.260 --> 13:07.300
Science says.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.140
Yeah, science says.

13:08.140 --> 13:10.940
Scienceblockspot.com.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.420
Anything Zach says in the future is correct.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.060
Shitscientistsay.com.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.460
And I was drunk enough the first few arguments

13:18.460 --> 13:21.260
that that worked, but no more.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.460
Oh boy.

13:26.460 --> 13:27.580
I'm nervous.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.060
My hands are sweating.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.740
Fucking get over it, Zach.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.740
Pull your shit together.

13:32.740 --> 13:33.900
I'm kidding, it's okay.

13:33.900 --> 13:38.100
Rose M-A-R-Y, a gaunt woman with crazy hair

13:38.100 --> 13:40.060
and enormous thick glasses

13:40.060 --> 13:43.300
that make her already large eyes look even bigger,

13:43.300 --> 13:46.780
dripping with muck from every orifice,

13:46.780 --> 13:50.460
wearing jeans and a white t-shirt with a leather jacket,

13:50.460 --> 13:53.900
leapt off the back of her commandeered four wheeler

13:53.900 --> 13:57.420
and mounted this thing of Clark's nightmares.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.140
The four metal tentacles

13:59.140 --> 14:01.340
that protrude from the back of her neck

14:01.340 --> 14:05.820
wrapped around this incomprehensibly enormous beast

14:05.820 --> 14:08.820
that drips with pure darkness.

14:08.820 --> 14:11.380
And the camera dollied left

14:11.380 --> 14:15.420
as this lumbering monster raced toward the ledge

14:15.420 --> 14:18.860
of its unnatural toilet paper roll treadmill.

14:18.860 --> 14:21.140
And as it falls,

14:21.140 --> 14:25.380
the camera turns 90 degrees sideways

14:25.380 --> 14:29.420
to match the change of the gravitational pull.

14:29.420 --> 14:34.260
The luminous land on which you all stand shakes

14:34.260 --> 14:39.260
as the Gigantumbra pithicus arrives on your axis

14:39.660 --> 14:44.260
and Rose M-A-R-Y, muscle memory engaged,

14:44.260 --> 14:49.020
leans back and casually throws a double thumbs up

14:49.020 --> 14:53.700
as the goddamn muck and Mairi behemoth beneath her

14:53.700 --> 14:57.780
roars in real sanity.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.820
Oh, fuck.

15:02.140 --> 15:04.340
I brought everything out here but my dice.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.060
Yeah, I failed.

15:06.060 --> 15:10.060
There should be some right in front of you, Thomas,

15:10.060 --> 15:12.340
in the little, can you hear me?

15:14.140 --> 15:15.620
You can still tell them where they are.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.380
In the thing.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.340
Nice, fucking nailed it.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.980
The yarn boat.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.780
Yarn boat, baby, yarn boat.

15:23.780 --> 15:24.860
It's so yarny.

15:24.860 --> 15:26.100
93, I fail.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.940
How'd you do there, Clark Bishop?

15:27.940 --> 15:29.660
You probably need me to roll again, right?

15:29.660 --> 15:32.780
That's because it's bad audio or something, right?

15:33.820 --> 15:36.460
This is the most I've ever wanted to lie about a roll,

15:36.460 --> 15:38.700
I think, in the history of the show,

15:38.700 --> 15:41.140
but it's an 82, so that's over my power.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.420
Oh, right, mine's way over my power too, yeah.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.900
Oh, I rolled over my power too.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.500
I had a lot of time to think about

15:48.500 --> 15:50.460
if I would lie about that roll or not.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.980
I was sitting there stewing, looking at the dice

15:54.980 --> 15:56.660
and saying, man, I could just say,

15:56.660 --> 15:59.500
I could just say it's under my power.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.340
I've lied about exactly one roll

16:02.340 --> 16:03.900
in the history of this podcast.

16:03.900 --> 16:08.100
It happened recently and I feel super, super bad about it.

16:08.100 --> 16:08.940
Oh, shit.

16:09.900 --> 16:10.900
Wow.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.820
That's just, for all the role players out there,

16:12.820 --> 16:14.380
don't do it, don't do it.

16:14.380 --> 16:15.220
There's no-

16:15.500 --> 16:17.460
I hate to do this, you're out.

16:18.820 --> 16:20.020
We signed a contract.

16:22.420 --> 16:23.340
That's fair.

16:24.740 --> 16:26.300
We did a blood oath with Zach

16:26.300 --> 16:27.980
that we would never lie to him.

16:27.980 --> 16:31.300
Even as jokingly, that made me want to cry.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.260
I'm sorry, dude.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.460
At least you've learned your fucking lesson.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.460
I just wanted to scare Joe straight

16:41.460 --> 16:43.140
and any other listeners.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.420
In the prison sense.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.260
You like that?

16:47.260 --> 16:48.820
You like the use of that language there, Thomas?

16:48.820 --> 16:49.660
Well, that's not what that-

16:49.660 --> 16:51.020
Feel good about that?

16:51.020 --> 16:53.460
I felt awkward about it as soon as it came out of my mouth,

16:53.460 --> 16:55.860
but that's not the intention of the phrase.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.780
Prison, it's scared straight, not great.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.340
Scared straight, not great.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.820
I felt with a 52, which is over my power.

17:06.820 --> 17:07.660
Oh my God.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.740
This is the worst.

17:08.740 --> 17:10.420
Yeah, this might be the end here.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.500
If you would have succeeded-

17:11.500 --> 17:12.580
Just take this one from the top.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.420
You would have-

17:15.580 --> 17:16.900
Yeah, Zach, how do you feel about

17:16.900 --> 17:18.500
lying about some rolls right now?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.500
How do you feel about lying about an episode?

17:25.900 --> 17:27.100
I'm not going to do it.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.380
Everything you planned this week down the shitter.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.540
1d4 would have been your sanity damage

17:32.540 --> 17:34.260
if you would have succeeded that check.

17:34.260 --> 17:37.700
So I need everyone to do 1d8 plus one.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.820
Holy shit.

17:38.820 --> 17:39.940
Oh my God.

17:39.940 --> 17:42.060
This really might be the end.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.980
Three for me, two plus one.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.380
Oh my God.

17:46.380 --> 17:48.620
I rolled a one.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.060
You fucker.

17:50.060 --> 17:53.820
And I had to because I've only got four sanity, so.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.940
Holy shit.

17:54.940 --> 17:55.940
Oh damn.

17:55.940 --> 17:58.420
I rolled a three plus one is four,

17:58.420 --> 18:02.020
which brings me down to 12

18:02.020 --> 18:05.540
and my breaking point is 10, so I'm good.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.460
I take that back about having only four sanity.

18:07.460 --> 18:08.300
I had seven.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.540
I was looking at my breaking point.

18:09.540 --> 18:12.420
So I'm at five total now with a breaking point of four.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.020
Damn, dude.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.220
This is bleak.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.500
Although I did kind of prepare

18:18.500 --> 18:20.540
because the next sentence in my notes is

18:20.540 --> 18:23.180
resolve what will probably be a shit show.

18:24.900 --> 18:25.740
Yeah.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.900
Why would you think that?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.180
I didn't hit my breaking point.

18:31.180 --> 18:32.020
No one did.

18:33.140 --> 18:34.260
No one hit their breaking point

18:34.260 --> 18:36.300
and no one rolled five or more sanity.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.740
So we don't have to do fight, flight or freeze.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.980
And we don't have to take on any new manias,

18:41.980 --> 18:44.820
but you did all roll over your power.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.060
In combat order, which we are now in,

18:48.060 --> 18:49.980
we're going to go through that.

18:49.980 --> 18:54.980
And Don automatically, with an extreme sanity hit here,

18:56.140 --> 18:59.740
even at your zero sanity,

18:59.740 --> 19:01.380
we'll peek behind the curtain there,

19:01.380 --> 19:03.420
Don D. Pettymore fully insane.

19:03.420 --> 19:06.740
Yeah, mine is zero right now.

19:06.740 --> 19:07.580
And who knows how long.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.740
Did you roll over zero?

19:08.740 --> 19:11.660
Yeah, I tried to roll, but I was just like, man.

19:11.660 --> 19:13.780
The dice just stopped midair.

19:13.900 --> 19:14.900
Threw it in the air.

19:16.580 --> 19:17.420
You're a fatal.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.020
Go ahead and roll, Justin, real quick for me.

19:19.020 --> 19:19.860
Gotcha.

19:21.580 --> 19:22.700
Oh, 15.

19:22.700 --> 19:23.540
Okay.

19:23.540 --> 19:24.900
Yeah, it's not over my willpower though,

19:24.900 --> 19:27.580
but yeah, it's a little over zero.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.460
Keith Vigna, you are standing next to yourself

19:32.460 --> 19:37.340
as you see this lumbering beast roar

19:37.340 --> 19:42.340
and the hair on your head is pushed back

19:42.540 --> 19:45.300
by the sheer power of this roar.

19:45.300 --> 19:50.260
Keith looks at the monster and at Rosemary

19:50.260 --> 19:52.820
and then at all the people surrounding him

19:52.820 --> 19:56.220
and he kind of starts to back away

19:56.220 --> 19:59.940
until he looks down at himself on the ground

20:01.980 --> 20:05.740
and sees the belts laying next to him.

20:05.740 --> 20:10.740
And he grabs the belts and puts it around his own neck

20:12.500 --> 20:15.500
but not his own neck, but his own neck

20:16.540 --> 20:21.540
and starts to strangle Silas, Keith, Beans, Cole.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.140
Silas Cole is far too weak

20:28.140 --> 20:31.540
and the blood in his body is all in the wrong places

20:31.540 --> 20:35.620
in order to resist this in a confident fashion.

20:35.620 --> 20:36.860
Also, as I'm doing that,

20:36.860 --> 20:39.420
I'm using one hand to kind of like strangle him

20:39.460 --> 20:42.620
and one hand to massage the blood back up into his head.

20:48.860 --> 20:51.460
Put it back, put it back, put it back, put it back.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.140
I don't know why you brought this thing here.

20:53.140 --> 20:55.620
A slender, muscular man in a black t-shirt

20:55.620 --> 20:57.820
with tribal tattoo sleeves on both arms

20:57.820 --> 21:00.380
going down his hands and fingertips

21:00.380 --> 21:04.460
with friend branded on his forehead,

21:04.460 --> 21:07.980
completely overwhelmed by terror,

21:08.020 --> 21:11.660
knows that the only thing he can do in this moment

21:11.660 --> 21:14.260
is try to take this thing down

21:14.260 --> 21:18.580
and he sprints toward this huge creature

21:18.580 --> 21:20.820
and he runs and he has this staff

21:20.820 --> 21:23.140
made of pure darkness in his hand

21:23.140 --> 21:25.260
and he's whipping it back and forth

21:25.260 --> 21:28.460
on either side of him to build up momentum and speed

21:28.460 --> 21:30.780
as he's sprinting toward this thing.

21:30.780 --> 21:34.420
And as he's about to jump to take his blow

21:34.420 --> 21:39.020
against this tree-sized limb that is hitting the ground,

21:39.020 --> 21:43.820
this bipedal creature just lifts one of its legs

21:43.820 --> 21:48.460
and stomps on the top of Germaine Glass,

21:48.460 --> 21:53.260
pushing him fully into the luminous land you all stand on.

21:53.260 --> 21:58.260
You see the body of Germaine Glass become engulfed

21:58.860 --> 22:03.020
in the oozing darkness of this creature

22:03.020 --> 22:06.980
and the entirety of Germaine Glass's body

22:06.980 --> 22:10.260
dissipates into the leg

22:10.260 --> 22:13.340
and as he is consumed,

22:13.340 --> 22:17.660
the creature grows ever so slightly.

22:17.660 --> 22:18.500
Oh no.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.820
Clark Bishop, you see red.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.940
Someone has to pay for this.

22:25.940 --> 22:29.340
Clark had just done that to-do haka-noose thing

22:29.340 --> 22:31.100
and it didn't work at fucking all

22:31.100 --> 22:33.140
and in fact, it broke it loose.

22:34.060 --> 22:37.300
So that's what he is flipped out about now.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.300
I think he wants to try again

22:39.300 --> 22:41.420
because he now is filled with rage.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.420
He wants to hurt that thing

22:43.420 --> 22:45.820
that he accidentally now has let loose.

22:45.820 --> 22:46.660
I think that's the thing

22:46.660 --> 22:48.820
he wants to try to take out his aggression on.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.860
He's gonna try another spell

22:51.860 --> 22:53.540
even though he doesn't know spells.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.940
He's gonna try and summon it up from within him to do it.

22:56.940 --> 22:57.780
I love it.

22:57.780 --> 22:59.060
I love it.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.820
Go ahead and roll a natural.

23:01.700 --> 23:02.540
Oh, shit.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.940
Are we doing the lying thing now?

23:12.940 --> 23:17.620
Yes, yes, fuck yes.

23:20.860 --> 23:23.660
It's an 81 on a 63.

23:23.660 --> 23:25.620
Ooh-wee.

23:25.620 --> 23:26.700
This is the worst.

23:26.700 --> 23:27.660
I hate this.

23:27.660 --> 23:28.500
This sucks.

23:30.060 --> 23:34.140
You're laughing and giggling like it's fun though.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.100
Fuck this game you've made us play.

23:36.100 --> 23:36.940
And I love it.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.820
I'm really happy personally

23:41.820 --> 23:43.380
and I'm rooting for you guys

23:43.380 --> 23:45.620
but I'm stoked about what just happened.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.700
Clark, go ahead and chant for me.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.860
Microwave dinner!

23:51.860 --> 23:55.020
Microwave dinner!

23:55.100 --> 23:58.500
Microwave dinner!

23:59.500 --> 24:01.340
A powerful and ancient spell.

24:02.340 --> 24:06.780
This enormous, powerful wave of these waves,

24:06.780 --> 24:10.340
these tiny radiation waves emit from your mouth

24:10.340 --> 24:14.340
and hit direct on this enormous lumbering creature

24:14.340 --> 24:18.020
that is at least five stories tall.

24:18.020 --> 24:22.820
And as it hits, this thing begins to crumble.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.020
Like an ooze that is dissipating,

24:28.020 --> 24:30.860
like a slug with salt being poured on it

24:30.860 --> 24:34.660
and Rosemary is slightly losing her balance on top.

24:34.660 --> 24:38.540
And then the vibration of this muck

24:38.540 --> 24:40.380
inside of this creature

24:40.380 --> 24:42.820
and covering the entirety of its outside

24:42.820 --> 24:47.820
and its limbs go into itself before it splits

24:47.820 --> 24:52.820
into two separate equally sized gigantumbra pithicuses

24:53.660 --> 24:55.580
that are the same size as the original

24:55.580 --> 24:58.540
but now there's two of them in front of you

24:58.540 --> 25:01.060
and Rosemary is on one.

25:02.580 --> 25:06.260
They put out their hands to each other

25:06.260 --> 25:08.260
like Romeo and Juliet

25:08.260 --> 25:11.940
in the Leonardo DiCaprio version in the class

25:11.940 --> 25:16.140
and then they turn their massive, unnatural,

25:16.140 --> 25:20.860
oozy, ape-like heads to face you all.

25:20.860 --> 25:22.180
You done fucked up, Clark.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.620
Oh, fuck.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.020
Oh, shit.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.140
My bad, my bad.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.860
Don D. Pettymore, you hear a phone ringing.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.380
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

25:34.380 --> 25:37.500
It's the, do y'all hear that?

25:37.500 --> 25:38.860
John, do you hear that?

25:38.860 --> 25:40.420
Do y'all hear that?

25:40.420 --> 25:41.900
It's the phone.

25:41.900 --> 25:45.660
And I start walking in the direction

25:45.660 --> 25:47.940
that the phone is, seemingly oblivious

25:47.940 --> 25:48.860
to everything around me.

25:48.860 --> 25:50.380
I didn't hear anything, Don.

25:50.380 --> 25:55.020
Which is the opposite direction of this gigantic beast

25:55.020 --> 25:58.820
and you are walking toward the towering building

25:58.820 --> 26:00.260
in the opposite direction.

26:00.260 --> 26:03.500
I'd start walking at first but I'm picking up speed

26:03.500 --> 26:06.220
while muttering to myself about the phone.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.060
We can, we can fix all the, I can fix this.

26:09.060 --> 26:10.140
I can fix this.

26:10.140 --> 26:12.500
Like you can kind of hear him like repeating

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
things like that over and over again.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.340
Radical.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.740
John, your turn.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.620
Having rolled over his power,

26:18.620 --> 26:23.620
John Lee Kevin Ball has lost sight of what he is.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.540
It finally all washes over him.

26:26.540 --> 26:30.540
The split bodies, the lives, everything

26:30.540 --> 26:32.860
and it's more than he can handle.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.620
And the situation is overwhelming

26:35.620 --> 26:40.460
but all he sees is Keith Beans killing his daddy.

26:41.420 --> 26:46.420
A white like glow pops out, you know,

26:47.380 --> 26:51.060
from the back of Sam Elliott's neck

26:51.060 --> 26:53.540
and a silver ball shoots into the air.

26:53.540 --> 26:56.860
Sam Elliott crumples like a little puppet.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.060
Just to the ground.

26:59.060 --> 27:01.380
Like you, like you cut its strings.

27:03.220 --> 27:05.860
And, and there is, there is a silver ball

27:05.860 --> 27:09.700
racing straight for Keith and Silas.

27:14.460 --> 27:15.380
Holy shit.

27:15.380 --> 27:20.380
Rose M-A-R-Y pinches the cuticle on her thumb

27:20.900 --> 27:23.980
and begins to peel.

27:23.980 --> 27:28.100
She pulls off a long strip of skin

27:28.100 --> 27:32.260
from her nail bed to the crook of her elbow.

27:32.260 --> 27:33.100
Hey Zach.

27:33.100 --> 27:33.940
And blood.

27:33.940 --> 27:35.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's up man?

27:35.220 --> 27:36.060
Ew.

27:36.060 --> 27:36.900
Can we fuck that?

27:39.220 --> 27:40.460
Hey Zach, can you not?

27:41.500 --> 27:43.660
Yeah, we tried to keep sex out of the podcast

27:43.660 --> 27:45.060
but if you could, you know,

27:45.060 --> 27:47.580
obviously you're getting very, you're getting very,

27:47.580 --> 27:50.220
I think it's gross when people force sex into role-playing

27:50.220 --> 27:52.260
but we want to fuck that.

27:58.820 --> 28:03.820
And this beautiful slit just has blood pouring out of it.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.340
You're not going to get me

28:05.340 --> 28:07.220
like you did with Giant Gash, buddy.

28:07.220 --> 28:08.620
It's not going to work twice.

28:09.620 --> 28:14.620
Blood pours down onto one of these gloomy beasts

28:14.940 --> 28:19.940
as she pulls off the skin on her forearm like fancy gloves,

28:20.780 --> 28:25.500
fingers first, and then one smooth removal.

28:25.500 --> 28:30.500
Rose M-A-R-Y reveals a silver metal structure

28:30.980 --> 28:34.780
and she cackles into the sky above.

28:35.460 --> 28:40.460
You poor, pitiful animals.

28:41.820 --> 28:46.820
You needed to so desperately remove me from your world.

28:47.700 --> 28:52.700
You hunted me and my children, my creations for what reason?

28:54.460 --> 28:58.620
Because we were already where you desire to be?

28:58.620 --> 29:01.820
Or do you hate yourselves as well?

29:01.860 --> 29:06.460
Regardless, humanity has had a good run,

29:06.460 --> 29:09.020
much better than you deserved.

29:09.020 --> 29:14.020
You claim to admire kindness and you reward the brutal.

29:14.340 --> 29:17.700
You insist patience is a virtue

29:17.700 --> 29:20.820
and you take advantage of the forgiving.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.100
You honor loyalty?

29:23.100 --> 29:25.980
It took absolutely zero effort.

29:25.980 --> 29:28.460
And she points at Silas Cole,

29:28.460 --> 29:31.300
fool branded across his forehead.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.900
For one of your own to spill the beans

29:34.900 --> 29:39.540
on the location of humankind's destruction.

29:39.540 --> 29:44.540
I am going to take these black shiny devils

29:45.540 --> 29:49.780
back to your world, break through Beans Pond

29:49.780 --> 29:52.260
into the underground temple,

29:52.260 --> 29:57.260
which houses vat upon vat of my beautiful residue.

29:58.260 --> 30:02.060
Rise back up with a colossal strength

30:02.060 --> 30:05.620
your minds could not begin to comprehend.

30:05.620 --> 30:10.620
And then finally I am going to consume everything you know.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.860
John Lee Pettyball stops dead in his tracks

30:16.860 --> 30:17.740
searing towards that.

30:17.740 --> 30:20.780
He had been speeding towards Keith and Silas,

30:20.780 --> 30:24.100
but he stops, the ball turns around

30:24.100 --> 30:26.300
from kind of just like the ground

30:27.180 --> 30:29.180
and the air around you.

30:29.180 --> 30:33.140
You hear the ball speaking and it says to Rosemary,

30:34.100 --> 30:36.980
did you really just take the time

30:36.980 --> 30:41.140
to fucking throw in a beans pun in your villain speech?

30:44.460 --> 30:48.020
And that's enough to snap him out of his mania I think.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.460
He's offended by that.

30:50.620 --> 30:55.620
Pettymores never weren't much for poorly placed pun.

31:02.860 --> 31:06.260
If your wordplay wasn't impeccable at a pettymore barbecue,

31:06.260 --> 31:09.060
you would be ruthlessly scolded and ridiculed.

31:12.020 --> 31:17.020
The second enormous gargantuan five-story tall creature

31:18.020 --> 31:21.260
melts itself down into a puddle of ooze

31:21.260 --> 31:25.620
and begins to climb the gigantic umbra pithicus

31:25.620 --> 31:28.220
that Rosemary rides on,

31:28.220 --> 31:33.220
making it twice as tall and twice as wide.

31:33.700 --> 31:38.700
There is now a 10-story tall ape-like,

31:39.340 --> 31:43.100
shadowy, dripping darkness kaiju

31:43.100 --> 31:44.380
that is standing before you.

31:44.580 --> 31:47.980
Rosemary is almost impossible to see.

31:47.980 --> 31:50.220
She's 10 stories high off the ground

31:50.220 --> 31:52.580
riding on the head of this creature

31:52.580 --> 31:56.220
and you see her tentacles are just waving about

31:56.220 --> 31:59.740
like she can't even control how fucking stoked she is

31:59.740 --> 32:01.460
about the situation.

32:01.460 --> 32:02.280
I'm gonna pee.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.040
It will literally take 20 seconds.

32:05.500 --> 32:10.500
One, two, three, four, five, six.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.180
I'll believe it when I see it.

32:14.180 --> 32:15.500
And hear it.

32:16.540 --> 32:21.140
Springfield, Missouri ranked number 56

32:21.140 --> 32:24.660
out of the top 200 biggest cities in the United States

32:24.660 --> 32:28.660
for zombie apocalypse preparedness.

32:28.660 --> 32:29.500
Yeah, that's pretty good.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.740
I think you'd rate higher.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.580
Shame we couldn't handle a real issue.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.420
Yeah.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.660
You shut the fuck up.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.060
There's a building downtown that-

32:38.060 --> 32:39.620
Like liberals.

32:39.660 --> 32:43.180
My mom told me when I was like a teenager maybe,

32:43.180 --> 32:44.300
so I don't know if she was correct.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.140
I never looked this up.

32:45.140 --> 32:46.260
I don't know if she was correct or not,

32:46.260 --> 32:47.460
but there's a building downtown

32:47.460 --> 32:49.380
that does nanotechnology work

32:49.380 --> 32:50.820
and part of what the research was

32:50.820 --> 32:52.820
was reanimating dead cells.

32:52.820 --> 32:55.340
And so I've always thought we're gonna be ground zero

32:55.340 --> 32:59.100
for any shit that goes zombie like that.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.740
Just like the Delta's area.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.900
68, 69.

33:02.900 --> 33:03.740
Yep.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.700
69 seconds, much longer than 20.

33:05.700 --> 33:06.780
Much longer than 20.

33:06.820 --> 33:10.460
I didn't start peeing until 13 seconds.

33:10.460 --> 33:14.740
That's when I was in the bathroom and had things going.

33:14.740 --> 33:15.580
I stopped at 38.

33:15.580 --> 33:17.260
Well, it's hard to piss when you're rock hard.

33:17.260 --> 33:20.540
I stopped shaking at 45,

33:20.540 --> 33:22.140
and then I got back here.

33:22.140 --> 33:24.060
That's a good shake.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.660
Well, you know, as you get older, it takes longer.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.660
My pee comes out faster than it's ever.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.780
To make it quicker, I usually just shake it while I pee.

33:33.780 --> 33:35.980
Slap it, whack it, throw it against the wall,

33:36.020 --> 33:37.620
but until you put it back in your pants,

33:37.620 --> 33:39.500
the last drop won't fall.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.340
That's true.

33:40.340 --> 33:43.780
Also, people who say if you shake it more than two times

33:43.780 --> 33:45.900
or whatever, you're playing with yourself,

33:45.900 --> 33:49.540
I don't know what kind of fucking fuck that person.

33:49.540 --> 33:51.060
Yeah, fuck them.

33:51.060 --> 33:52.580
They don't know what it's like to pee.

33:52.580 --> 33:53.960
All right, well, this is the anthem,

33:53.960 --> 33:56.540
so you guys should throw all your hands up.

33:56.540 --> 33:58.140
Who was that?

33:58.140 --> 33:59.340
Good Charlotte.

33:59.340 --> 34:01.100
Good Charlotte, that's right.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.660
Shake it once, that's fine.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.540
Shake it twice, that's okay.

34:06.540 --> 34:10.380
Shake it three times, you're playing with yourself.

34:12.780 --> 34:13.620
Wait, really?

34:13.620 --> 34:14.460
There's a song?

34:14.460 --> 34:17.100
Yeah, that's the bridge of a song.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.060
That's what I knew it from, yeah.

34:19.060 --> 34:23.500
That song was the theme song of Madden 2003.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.720
So it played every single time you opened that game,

34:26.720 --> 34:31.060
so I had that song stuck in my head for years.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.700
That album's pretty good for what it is.

34:33.700 --> 34:37.620
That sounds like exactly the peak Madden year for Zaggy.

34:37.620 --> 34:40.340
Little 11-year-old Zach, love that shit.

34:40.340 --> 34:41.940
This creature just became enormous.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.220
Thomas got hard, went pee.

34:43.220 --> 34:46.580
So now we are at Keith.

34:46.580 --> 34:49.340
Keith is strangling Keith,

34:49.340 --> 34:54.340
but he hears beans between Mary and John Ball, Jovi.

34:54.340 --> 34:59.340
Mary and John Ball, Jovi, he hears beans three times.

35:04.180 --> 35:07.260
This damn beans pun is gonna be a downfall.

35:07.260 --> 35:09.740
He hears beans three times

35:09.740 --> 35:12.700
and it snaps him out of it.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.340
He's hearing his last name

35:15.340 --> 35:18.740
and he loses his grip on the belt

35:18.740 --> 35:21.840
and stops massaging the blood up to Keith's head.

35:22.280 --> 35:27.280
He looks at his friends around him

35:28.920 --> 35:32.720
and he's like, she just told us her plan.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.040
We can stop her now.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.140
You hear reverberating around you.

35:37.140 --> 35:39.300
Yeah, that's like a classic villain mistake

35:39.300 --> 35:43.560
to just give it all away in the big reveal speech.

35:43.560 --> 35:46.400
I completely agree, I'm on your side.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.440
Keith.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.520
Do you choke him less?

35:49.520 --> 35:52.040
I drop the belt and it's just kind of like,

35:52.040 --> 35:53.880
both of the belts are just kind of like,

35:53.880 --> 35:56.160
he's wearing them like a necklace.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.520
I get down on my knees and look Keith right in the eyes.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.880
Hey, hey buddy, hey me.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.040
You're gonna do something real important right now

36:09.040 --> 36:11.240
and I'm gonna help you feel up to it.

36:11.240 --> 36:15.800
You're gonna distract that.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.680
And I gesture to the 10 story tall thing

36:19.680 --> 36:22.600
and I put my finger up his nose

36:22.600 --> 36:25.040
and pull my thumb like a finger gun.

36:27.360 --> 36:30.060
And then I slap him on the back and say, go.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.880
An enormous amount of glass family cocaine

36:33.880 --> 36:38.720
goes straight up into the dome of Silas Cole who hasn't.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.200
I thought you knew of some secret Keith button

36:42.200 --> 36:45.120
up your nose, that every Keith had.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.720
Technically it's a, I know how to unlock the powers.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.400
But no, you just like really dosed him

36:55.400 --> 36:56.980
dangerously against his will.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.200
The ethics of dosing yourself.

37:05.280 --> 37:08.040
If any of these characters cared about ethics,

37:08.040 --> 37:10.040
they would have died a long time ago.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.280
Or would have just left.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.240
Probably wouldn't have stolen all the stuff

37:14.240 --> 37:15.880
from the green box.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.300
Anyway, I slap him on the back and say, go get him buddy.

37:19.300 --> 37:21.720
I start running towards the building.

37:21.720 --> 37:25.360
So Keith and Keith begin running in opposite directions.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.640
It is Clark Bishop's turn.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.160
Clark thinks our Keith's got the right idea.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.480
I think getting in that building

37:30.480 --> 37:33.200
is at least we'll buy some time.

37:33.200 --> 37:38.200
John Ball, I don't know if you can hear me.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.540
Can you hear me?

37:40.580 --> 37:42.980
We're going for the building.

37:42.980 --> 37:46.140
You don't exactly hear it, but like the vibe,

37:46.140 --> 37:49.700
something about the way the air feels around your head.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.300
Answers in assurance.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.220
It's not like you hear the word yes.

37:54.220 --> 37:55.340
Oh shit.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.300
You just feel that like John said yes.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.260
That's dope.

38:02.140 --> 38:02.980
It's fucking rad.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.660
Grab your uncle, we gotta, let's go.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.020
He's already heading there.

38:06.020 --> 38:06.980
I'm already on my way.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.420
You wanna take that line again?

38:11.220 --> 38:12.260
Let's follow Don.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.180
And it's Don's turn.

38:21.180 --> 38:24.140
And Don hears Keith coming up behind him.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.420
Am I still hearing the telephone in front of me?

38:30.420 --> 38:31.240
Oh yeah.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.780
Louder and louder with each step.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.180
Zeroed in on the phone.

38:34.180 --> 38:37.940
I pick up my pace if I wasn't already in like a full run.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.220
I'm just hoofing it.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.220
Can you hear it?

38:41.180 --> 38:43.740
Talking as though everyone's with me.

38:43.740 --> 38:44.860
Do you hear it, John?

38:44.860 --> 38:47.580
John, John, can you hear it?

38:47.580 --> 38:50.400
The air answers back yes, you feel that.

38:50.400 --> 38:54.640
And you also just hear like, it's gonna be okay.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.940
And Clark hears, I'm with you, run.

38:57.940 --> 39:00.740
And Keith hears, you're on the right path.

39:00.740 --> 39:04.020
But if you stop to look back, the ball hasn't moved.

39:04.020 --> 39:08.300
The ball sinks down from where it's floating in the air.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.580
And it almost seems to like sink

39:10.580 --> 39:12.300
into the ground a little bit.

39:12.300 --> 39:17.300
You can see weird currents and jolts from the air around it,

39:17.580 --> 39:20.480
sort of like snapping into where the ball is.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.560
And there's a strange ozone smell

39:22.560 --> 39:24.660
and there's electricity around you.

39:24.660 --> 39:26.860
And that's all you see right now.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.400
Oh my God.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.260
Holy shit, what's going on?

39:31.260 --> 39:32.100
Yeah.

39:35.900 --> 39:38.900
For those of you running toward the building,

39:38.900 --> 39:43.900
suddenly you see a man bent over head and hands and stocks.

39:44.420 --> 39:48.660
He's dressed like he is in the old West actually.

39:48.660 --> 39:52.800
And fool has been branded into his forehead.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.560
And as you're running toward him, you can hear him.

39:56.420 --> 39:58.060
He's just muttering to himself.

39:58.060 --> 40:02.220
We was made a real good running at him.

40:02.220 --> 40:04.240
I was getting evicted soon.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.660
Too much damn hesitation.

40:06.660 --> 40:10.300
And as he's saying hesitation, he looks up

40:10.300 --> 40:12.940
and sees what's happening in the distance

40:12.940 --> 40:14.180
for the first time.

40:14.180 --> 40:16.100
And he just stops cold.

40:16.100 --> 40:21.100
And you all hear a slight chant song,

40:21.180 --> 40:23.780
reverberating from the other side

40:23.780 --> 40:26.660
of this towering dark buildings.

40:26.660 --> 40:28.580
And the first time you've gotten close enough

40:28.580 --> 40:31.500
to hear behind this building,

40:31.500 --> 40:36.060
the power of these voices, a chorus hits you

40:36.060 --> 40:39.200
like the sound of cascading waters

40:39.200 --> 40:43.300
and like the rumbling of loud thunder.

40:45.100 --> 40:49.180
Shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,

40:49.180 --> 40:53.060
shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,

40:53.160 --> 40:57.080
shock tea for leecha, shock tea for leecha,

40:57.080 --> 41:00.440
shock tea for leecha, for the overseer.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.040
Shock tea for leecha.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.540
For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,

41:06.540 --> 41:10.320
For the overseer, shock tea for leecha,

41:10.320 --> 41:15.740
For the overseer, shock tea for leecha.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.300
And Clark, you recognize this sound.

41:18.300 --> 41:19.800
My theme song.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.620
That's right.

41:23.180 --> 41:26.180
It's the music that plays at the end of Wheel of Fortune.

41:29.540 --> 41:30.820
Wait, really?

41:30.820 --> 41:34.940
Is the Wheel of Fortune end song a banger?

41:34.940 --> 41:37.140
Yes, it 100 million percent is.

41:37.140 --> 41:38.060
Yes, it is.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.020
I'll have to check that out.

41:39.020 --> 41:41.300
I'll have that to a few playlists.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.100
Fun dance times, number three.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.300
Intimate home moments.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.500
Wheel of Fortune end theme.

41:48.500 --> 41:52.940
And this huge mass of people

41:52.940 --> 41:56.220
begins walking in a circle

41:56.220 --> 41:58.020
from around one side of the building.

41:58.020 --> 42:01.200
You see two circles of people,

42:01.200 --> 42:03.440
a bigger circle and an inner circle,

42:03.440 --> 42:05.460
the outer circle going clockwise,

42:05.460 --> 42:08.620
the inner circle moving counterclockwise

42:08.620 --> 42:10.340
as they're chanting this song.

42:10.340 --> 42:13.540
And you recognize there's a bunch of people dressed

42:13.540 --> 42:16.760
like they're from the Old West in old timey clothing.

42:17.600 --> 42:22.600
Some of them have friend branded across their foreheads.

42:22.640 --> 42:26.160
And every single person who is in either the inner

42:26.160 --> 42:29.440

42:30.640 --> 42:32.800
they're all holding an animal

42:32.800 --> 42:35.620
or have an animal right alongside them.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.620

44:11.080 --> 44:12.400
Does he not wear a drug rug?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.680
Oh, is that what those hippie ponchos are called?

44:14.720 --> 44:16.160
Yeah.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.440

44:23.320 --> 44:24.920
I get it, yeah.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.840
You call them ketamine coveralls.

You see Councilwoman Carrie Page's body,

44:31.520 --> 44:34.920

45:02.760 --> 45:04.040
Are there dinosaur?

45:04.040 --> 45:04.880
Yeah.

45:04.880 --> 45:05.700
Great question.

45:05.700 --> 45:07.040
No, are there a dinosaur?

45:07.040 --> 45:08.120
Answer.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.280
Are there a dinosaur?

45:09.280 --> 45:10.600
Are there a dinosaur?

45:10.600 --> 45:11.440
Are there a dinosaur?

45:11.440 --> 45:14.160
We all know humans and dinosaurs co-existed, so.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.240
Are there has-been of a dinosaur in here?

45:16.240 --> 45:18.320
There are any contention dinosaurs?

45:18.320 --> 45:19.640
From a long time ago.

45:19.640 --> 45:24.420
I was just teaching my students is R, plural and singular,

45:24.420 --> 45:27.200
and I used farts as an example.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.120
We were learning the word disgusting,

45:29.120 --> 45:31.440
so I asked one of them what's disgusting,

45:31.440 --> 45:32.280
and they said farts.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.740
What's disgusting is you haven't answered

45:33.740 --> 45:35.120
if there was a dinosaur or not.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.920
Yeah, are there a dinosaur there?

45:36.920 --> 45:38.220
That's fair, okay.

45:38.220 --> 45:39.060
I'm gonna assume, yeah.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.100
No, there's not a fucking dinosaur there.

45:42.100 --> 45:44.580
You said animals from all times.

45:44.580 --> 45:47.240
Professor Horace Green raises his hand,

45:47.240 --> 45:49.960
and he's like, actually, the whole area

45:49.960 --> 45:52.300
was an inland ocean in those times.

45:52.300 --> 45:54.720
There was never any dinosaurs here.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.420
But there was my beloved mosasaurus.

45:57.420 --> 45:58.740
And you do see a mosasaurus,

45:58.740 --> 46:01.140
which is kind of like a crocodile whale,

46:01.140 --> 46:03.820
fall out of the sky and die gasping for air.

46:05.820 --> 46:06.780
There's the one.

46:06.780 --> 46:08.780
There's the one.

46:08.780 --> 46:10.800
We brought one dinosaur.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.640
It's dead.

46:12.820 --> 46:15.100
It's not a dinosaur, but it's contemporaneous.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.700
Yeah, I know big words too.

46:20.900 --> 46:21.820
I don't.

46:21.820 --> 46:22.660
I shouldn't lie like that.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.900
Sorry, I've read books, Justin.

46:24.900 --> 46:27.040
But are you Red Book?

46:27.040 --> 46:27.880
Are you Red Book?

46:27.880 --> 46:29.040
Are you Red Book?

46:43.120 --> 46:47.240
Leaving my mind at your altar

46:47.240 --> 46:49.360
Crossing the double line

46:49.360 --> 46:50.920
Doing it every time

46:50.920 --> 46:55.920
Tell me what kind of world are you living in

46:59.680 --> 47:04.680
What kind of world are you living in

47:04.680 --> 47:09.680
What kind of world are you living in

47:24.680 --> 47:29.680
What kind of world are you living in

47:29.680 --> 47:34.680
What kind of world are you living in
