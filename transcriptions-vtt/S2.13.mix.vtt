WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode.

00:04.400 --> 00:09.760
Because I'm sitting here and I'm like, I don't like being here.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.240
Julius looks at...

00:11.240 --> 00:14.040
Content warning, not fun.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.040
This one?

00:15.040 --> 00:16.040
Not so fun.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.040
Not fun, man.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.160
Let's go to an ad.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.160
It's...

00:23.160 --> 00:24.160
Wait, we're gonna...

00:24.160 --> 00:25.160
Do we do an ad?

00:25.160 --> 00:26.160
We're gonna go to an ad?

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
We do an ad?

00:27.160 --> 00:28.160
We're gonna go to an ad.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.160
An ad.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.840
Hey, listeners!

00:31.840 --> 00:33.880
And Joe and Thomas and Luke, I got some questions for you.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.600
You need to go back, that automatically indicates the first bit I had.

00:37.600 --> 00:38.600
What?

00:38.600 --> 00:41.640
It's the start of your day peaceful...

00:41.640 --> 00:42.640
What?

00:42.640 --> 00:43.640
Hey, listeners.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.440
Oh, are we the listeners?

00:46.440 --> 00:47.440
Got it.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.440
Fucking nailed it.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.440
So good.

00:49.440 --> 00:57.760
I got some questions for you.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.240
Luke, is the start of your day peaceful?

00:59.240 --> 01:00.240
No.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.040
Are you tired of being scared awake by your alarm every day, Joe?

01:04.040 --> 01:05.960
It's like waking up to a jump scare every morning.

01:05.960 --> 01:09.400
Do you wake up feeling groggy as hell, Thomas?

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Yeah.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.440
Are you losing out on precious sleep because of your partner's different schedule?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.440
Yeah, my freaking partner.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
Not anymore.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.680
Either way, I am.

01:23.680 --> 01:29.200
That's why I must tell you about the hero of my morning, silent wake up.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
Silent wake up?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
Silent wake up?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.680
I've heard of an angel of the morning, but a hero of the morning?

01:33.680 --> 01:35.400
A hero of the morning.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.700
What is silent wake up?

01:36.700 --> 01:40.480
It's the having a sandwich for breakfast of the alarm clock game.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.480
It is...

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
Is that in the copy?

01:42.480 --> 01:43.480
No, it isn't.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.480
You just gave him something free.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.480
I don't know if you should say that.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.280
Well, I don't know if it's good.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.280
Having a sandwich is the best meal you can have, so having it in the morning...

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
That's not true.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.760
I mean, I do like the...

01:54.760 --> 01:58.520
Well, wrong.

01:58.520 --> 02:03.520
The wearable alarm that gradually wakes you up using soothing vibrations and silent wake

02:03.520 --> 02:04.600
up.

02:04.600 --> 02:10.000
Sound alarms instantly wake you up by spiking your adrenaline and blood pressure, causing...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, that's sound...

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Okay, that's sound alarms.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Because I was like, that sounds bad.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I don't want that.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That is not this product.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.920
That's like eating a turd sandwich for breakfast of the morning.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.920
Yes.

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
Exactly.

02:21.920 --> 02:28.680
That solution slowly transitions you from a deep to light sleep over 10 minutes before

02:28.680 --> 02:30.960
gently awakening you.

02:30.960 --> 02:37.120
That sounds better than like seven cell phone alarms every seven minutes.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.720
It's like the nuclear meltdown sound and I'm like, God, now I gotta get up.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.560
Do you feel shame when you've like hit the snooze like a certain amount of times?

02:45.560 --> 02:51.840
I feel accomplishment, but I think this would eliminate that.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.380
You can even personalize your morning with customizable modes for those heavy and light

02:56.380 --> 02:57.380
sleepers out there.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.520
Are you guys heavy or light sleepers?

02:59.520 --> 03:02.720
Not getting a lot of sleep lately because normally I'm a very heavy sleeper, but lately

03:02.720 --> 03:05.160
I'm a pretty light sleeper.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.000
It's because I got a shitty mattress, so if we could get one of those on next.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.400
Well, as much as you'll love your silent wake up, your partner will love it even more.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
My partner?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.600
I love thinking about them.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.400
No longer will either of you be disturbed by the other's snooze addiction.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.440
Does your snooze addiction affect your wife?

03:25.440 --> 03:29.920
No, it doesn't because I wake up far later than she does.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.360
And you wake up hours later and you wake up with a silent wake up.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.560
That's right.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.640
Without any noise whatsoever.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.760
And I tried to scream, but I can't, it's just the ads don't have to be horror.

03:40.760 --> 03:41.760
That's right.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.760
That's right.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
That's right.

03:43.760 --> 03:54.120

04:00.960 --> 04:02.400
Everyone all together now?

04:02.400 --> 04:05.920
The smarter wake up is a silent wake up.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.920
Fucking nailed it.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.600
Howdy there, my friends.

04:10.600 --> 04:18.960
I just got back from my vacation back in the pirate times and have made my way all the

04:18.960 --> 04:24.400
way back to the July 5th, 2022 times.

04:24.400 --> 04:29.560
Damn, I miss those pirate oceans.

04:29.560 --> 04:35.560
My fur though does not take kindly to the briny beast that is the ocean.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.320
Gotta re-grease up my quills.

04:38.360 --> 04:44.160
So welcome once again to the briniest broadcast this side of the Bermuda.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.680
694.2 PTBP.

04:47.680 --> 04:55.920
I am your loyal and humble host, Wolf the Dog, and you are my loyal listenership.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.480
You sometimes write me things.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.720
I sometimes read them.

05:01.720 --> 05:08.680
This howlin' with Wolf is from Derek Enfargo N.D., who tweeted about the show and tagged

05:08.680 --> 05:13.480
at Pretending Pod, a very cool thing you should do.

05:13.480 --> 05:20.200
Derek Enfargo N.D. writes, Dear Wolf, you kooky bastards are the reason

05:20.200 --> 05:23.640
I got my group to start playing D.G.

05:23.640 --> 05:29.320
We at Fuckboys Central owe a debt to you for all we've gotten into.

05:29.320 --> 05:35.440
From stealing a helicopter and killing a hand monster with hellfire missiles to having

05:35.440 --> 05:42.440
a canoe-sized bomb dropped on an agent and explode the theater just as his bloody entrails

05:42.440 --> 05:45.680
slopped out for a ritual sacrifice.

05:45.680 --> 05:55.640
Shout out to Scoots, Danimal, Bozzie, Goofah, Cashew, Jesus, Matt, and your OG Fuckboy,

05:55.640 --> 05:56.640
Drable.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.160
Thanks for all the fish.

05:59.200 --> 06:06.120
And thanks to you, Fargo Derek, I think your group has potential to go far.

06:06.120 --> 06:11.880
If you want to write up something for your salty wolf to howl, just do a quick little

06:11.880 --> 06:19.760
shout out to your favorites here at 694.2 PTBP and tag at Pretending Pod on Twitter

06:19.760 --> 06:25.320
or Instagram, tag Pretending To Be People on Facebook, or write a five-star review on

06:25.320 --> 06:30.240
the podcast app of your choice and send them screenshots.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.520
The links are in the show notes.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.520
Click them.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.520
Cook them now.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.600
Or after the show.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.040
You just better look at them at the least.

06:39.040 --> 06:45.200
Sorry, being back in 2022 has me on the edge of my mind's chair.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.840
There's just so much more of the news.

06:48.840 --> 06:55.080
Last time, right after Luke, Joe, Thomas, and Zach stood up from recording the end of

06:55.080 --> 07:02.160
The Death of a Salesman, just like immediately after Zach stopped recording, Thomas exclaimed,

07:02.160 --> 07:06.640
Holy shit, did we just create the Bermuda Triangle?

07:06.640 --> 07:11.760
But back here in 2022, things aren't going so cool.

07:11.760 --> 07:18.720
In the hidden, unnatural, Godel company town, Grover's Gorge, Fred Godel is nowhere to

07:18.720 --> 07:24.360
be seen except on the screens in the train and the statue in front of the lab.

07:24.360 --> 07:32.280
However, Vernon Covington, the landlord, has with a large audience accused Cal Colorado,

07:32.280 --> 07:39.720
Beck Wilder, Julius Summers, and Stevie of the murder of the mayor of Grover's Gorge,

07:39.720 --> 07:42.440
a turtle named Sandro.

07:42.440 --> 07:49.720
When the can crew spoke in resistance, they were the victims of Vernon Covington's relentless

07:49.720 --> 07:52.160
vitriol and violence.

07:52.160 --> 07:58.560
The latter was most harshly directed at Julius Summers, who lays on the ground bleeding like

07:58.560 --> 08:02.480
a fountain from his face, barely conscious.

08:02.480 --> 08:09.520
And that's when the landlord called for a specific punishment, stoned to death.

08:09.520 --> 08:18.160
Taking us now to a conflictingly less-than-hell-yeah-dude moment, it's Altergirl with My Life is Great

08:18.160 --> 08:20.560
and It's All My Fault.

08:39.520 --> 09:02.240
Welcome back to Pretending to Be People, after a four-episode run as pirates.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
Argh.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.240
Here's what I'm thinking.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.240
Oh, and 80s.

09:06.240 --> 09:13.320
Bones are their money, and also their food, and that's it.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.880
But what if the part that we already recorded isn't in here anymore?

09:16.880 --> 09:17.880
Yeah.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.880
We're gonna have to keep it in, then.

09:19.880 --> 09:20.880
Argh.

09:20.880 --> 09:25.240
We can just let that sit there.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.960
Zach asked you to talk about pirates and- Pirates eat bones, maybe?

09:29.960 --> 09:33.000
I can't remember if I got a solid argh- You can't say it never happened.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
In the pirate ark.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I don't know if I got one in here.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Do you want to get one now?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Argh.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Go, Joe.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.320
This is your one and wild argh.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.120
Is that how you're gonna use it?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.120
Argh.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
Oh.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
That was pretty good.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.120
No, it wasn't.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.120
Don't fucking...

09:48.120 --> 09:49.120
Oh.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
Oh.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.120
Oh.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.120
Oh.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
Oh.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.120
Oh.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.120
Oh.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.120
Oh.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
Oh.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.120
Don't coddle the boy.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
I thought it was pretty good.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.120
Give me an argh, motherfucker.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
Argh.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.120
What?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
I didn't know if you pushed people aggressively and got better results.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
Have you ever heard of Stanley Cooper?

10:04.240 --> 10:07.240
Is Thomas Stanley Kubrick of this podcast?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.240
No, no, no.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.600
There's a difference between inspiration and abuse.

10:10.600 --> 10:14.200
What I do is abuse.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.280
Which ultimately provides better material.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.280
Excellent.

10:18.280 --> 10:24.800
Excellent short-term results.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.040
He never wanted to do a shining too, so it's like he doesn't care what happens after.

10:29.040 --> 10:35.200
He doesn't care what bridges I burn.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.680
Jack, you're cool.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.680
This lady, though...

10:37.680 --> 10:39.200
What was her name?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
Shelley Duvall.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.200
Shelley Duvall.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
Poor lady.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.200
Poor, poor lady.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.200
Yeah.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
Seems like it was a bad time.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.200
Yeah.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.520
Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.

10:49.520 --> 10:50.920
Have you seen that video?

10:50.920 --> 10:54.280
No, I thought you were just playing character now on the show.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.280
I was like, wow, bold choice.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.280
Let's see where it goes.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.520
What was shooting like?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.520
She hosted some show that she was the...

11:04.520 --> 11:06.520
Every intro, she said, hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.520
And she said it in the exact same way.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.520
So somebody made a compilation of her saying it a million times in a row.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
It's really...

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
She's a fucking pro.

11:14.520 --> 11:15.520
It's a fun video.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.520
Yeah.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.520
She's an ultra pro.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.520
It's like perfect every time.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.520
Whoa.

11:19.520 --> 11:25.520
Do you think that we should like say the same thing at the beginning of all of our episodes?

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
Sure.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
Yeah.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.760
Fuck off, fuckaroos.

11:29.760 --> 11:34.760
It's another episode of pretending to be people.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.760
So, I mean, that's one idea.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.760
It's kind of just Gabrus's what's up shit heads.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.760
What if we just did the same thing every episode?

11:43.760 --> 11:44.760
Every time.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
The full episode?

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
From start to finish.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
Yeah.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.760
Episode one over and over and over again.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.760
Hold on, I got to turn my heads down a little bit.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.760
Until we get it right.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.760
Can you reach it?

11:53.760 --> 11:54.760
You can.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
Hello, I'm Shelley Duvall.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You fucking nailed it.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
You said it the exact same way you said it last time.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
That was crazy.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Well.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
So, Zach.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I don't want to be a pirate.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.560
We just got out of the pirate arch, which, holy shit, man, there were some things that

12:09.560 --> 12:10.960
happened in there.

12:10.960 --> 12:15.400
But before the pirates, an even crazier thing was happening to our characters in the real

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
world.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.040
Nobody remembers that.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.040
In the real world is a great way to say it.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.300
In the present world.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.760
In the not pirate world.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.760
It is the real world.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.760
It's just spooky.

12:27.760 --> 12:28.760
It's just spooky.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.760
This is all spooky.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.440
Luke, what was happening at the end of the last episode?

12:33.440 --> 12:34.440
Was Julius fine?

12:34.440 --> 12:40.840
Oh, he was having just a fine day until he ran into...

12:40.840 --> 12:42.720
You don't have it in your notes?

12:42.720 --> 12:44.360
He just looked to everyone in the room.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.920
He looked at it in his character sheet.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Joe, don't show him.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.640
Were you looking for your name?

12:48.640 --> 12:49.640
Your character's name?

12:49.640 --> 12:50.640
Vernon.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.780
Until he ran into Vernon.

12:52.780 --> 12:57.500
And then he was not having such a great day anymore, because he's almost dead.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.900
He was having about as bad a day as you can have.

13:00.900 --> 13:06.940
I would say one point away from ending his day completely.

13:06.940 --> 13:11.220
Have we ever taken a PC down to one hit point on the show before?

13:11.220 --> 13:21.060
Taking a PC down to one hit point on the show before.

13:21.060 --> 13:25.760
So I've turned my headphones down, but Luke is still peaking really hard for me.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.760
That's the thing.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.740
I'm louder than everybody else is, for sure.

13:28.740 --> 13:31.220
I always forget he just talks way louder than everybody else.

13:31.220 --> 13:34.000
Bing bong, bing bong, shooby dooby doop.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.300
It's all that theater training.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.300
He projects.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.300
Yeah.

13:37.300 --> 13:43.540
I think the mics just don't pick up the deeper, more powerful voices in the room as much as

13:43.540 --> 13:44.540
they do the...

13:44.540 --> 13:51.380
The whiny, little, shrill, annoying voices.

13:51.380 --> 13:56.420
As someone who listens to all of us on a regular occasion, I'm constantly surprised by how

13:56.420 --> 14:01.940
deep Luke's voice is still to this day when I'm editing, and I'm like, whoa, he got down

14:01.940 --> 14:02.940
there.

14:02.940 --> 14:03.940
Hello, dude.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.940
Luke, give us an argh.

14:05.940 --> 14:06.940
Argh.

14:06.940 --> 14:07.940
Hmm.

14:07.940 --> 14:12.940
I genuinely believe that's the best you can do.

14:12.940 --> 14:13.940
Fuck.

14:13.940 --> 14:14.940
Argh.

14:14.940 --> 14:15.940
Argh.

14:15.940 --> 14:25.340
See, you've got to tailor your abuse to each person to get the most out of them.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.100
Jesus Christ.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.700
I am afraid to argh.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.860
Hey, Zach.

14:32.860 --> 14:33.860
Yeah.

14:33.860 --> 14:34.860
Mm-hmm.

14:34.860 --> 14:35.860
Yeah.

14:35.860 --> 14:38.620
Let's get this episode going, huh?

14:38.620 --> 14:39.620
Yes, thank you.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.180
Let us begin.

14:41.420 --> 14:43.500
Well, I do like the...

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
Fuck.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.980
You got me all riled up.

14:47.980 --> 14:51.020
Lettuce, tomato, pickles and onions.

14:51.020 --> 14:57.300
I want to go back and keep talking about where we were at the end of episode eight, because

14:57.300 --> 14:59.940
that was a fair few moments ago.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.460
I can sum it up in four words.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.460
Okay.

15:03.460 --> 15:04.460
Ouchie, ouchie.

15:04.460 --> 15:05.460
Hell yeah.

15:05.860 --> 15:10.260
Would you like to...

15:10.260 --> 15:14.500
I think your forward explanation needs a slight explanation, but it is well done.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.500
Yeah.

15:15.500 --> 15:20.740
I think it's appropriate for listeners who remember what's going on, but entirely inappropriate

15:20.740 --> 15:21.740
for the job of...

15:21.740 --> 15:22.740
Catching anyone up.

15:22.740 --> 15:23.740
Yeah.

15:23.740 --> 15:25.420
That is my explanation.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.860
Would somebody else like to give it a crack?

15:27.860 --> 15:30.860
Julius hurt.

15:30.860 --> 15:31.860
We're fucked.

15:31.860 --> 15:33.860
Oh, we didn't need to...

15:34.260 --> 15:36.260
I really appreciate the effort, but I...

15:36.260 --> 15:37.460
It didn't have to be in four words.

15:37.460 --> 15:40.820
It did not have to be in four words that time specifically.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.420
But also very good job.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.980
Yeah, super well done.

15:43.980 --> 15:44.980
Four words, Joe?

15:44.980 --> 15:47.980
Landlord, bang, bang, bang.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.980
Yep.

15:48.980 --> 15:53.980
Oh no, four words about the story.

15:53.980 --> 15:56.980
You already told us what you were up to today.

15:56.980 --> 15:57.980
Three times, wow.

15:57.980 --> 15:58.980
Fucking your landlord.

16:01.980 --> 16:02.980
Pretty impressive.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.980
Thanks guys.

16:07.980 --> 16:08.980
Three times, not bad.

16:08.980 --> 16:11.620
Yeah, we're getting old.

16:11.620 --> 16:14.620
What is your refraction period?

16:14.620 --> 16:16.620
Refractory.

16:16.620 --> 16:21.620
What is your refractory period?

16:21.620 --> 16:24.620
What was that?

16:24.620 --> 16:30.620
I was doing the same laugh I did the time before, but I just didn't have it in me that

16:30.620 --> 16:31.620
time as much.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.620
I thought you were trying to laugh in reverse.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.380
Give us an R.

16:37.380 --> 16:40.380
I got it.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.380
Yeah, nailed it in one.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.380
So we killed the mayor.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.380
We didn't kill the mayor.

16:52.380 --> 16:56.380
The mayor, if he was killed by anybody...

16:56.380 --> 16:59.380
The turtle mayor of this bullshit town committed suicide.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.140
With the help of possibly...

17:02.140 --> 17:04.140
God damn it.

17:04.140 --> 17:06.140
Well, Julius did say he would watch it.

17:06.140 --> 17:12.140
Well, Julius, I guess, but the guy, the guy who spoke for the mayor.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.140
The guy who asked you to watch it?

17:14.140 --> 17:15.140
Chuck.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.140
Chuck.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.140
Chuck Bidwell.

17:17.140 --> 17:20.140
If anybody killed the mayor, it was Chuck Bidwell.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.140
Turtle dies.

17:23.140 --> 17:24.140
Other stuff.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.140
Town mad.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.140
Yeah, turtle dies, town mad.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.900
That's the four words we were looking for.

17:29.900 --> 17:34.900
Yeah, and then you guys came down and saw a very dry turtle corpse there on the ground

17:34.900 --> 17:41.900
before you headed out and saw the crowd all staring at you angrily, almost rabid, to see

17:41.900 --> 17:43.900
what happens to you.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.900
There's your answer, Joe.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.900
This is very similar to something that actually happened to me in preschool.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.900
Whoa, what?

17:49.900 --> 17:55.900
This girl brought a frog to school and was showing everybody on the playground and it

17:55.900 --> 18:00.900
was all loose and everybody's looking for it and they all run up into this tree house

18:00.900 --> 18:05.900
to look for it there and I'm standing near the bottom just looking around and they all

18:05.900 --> 18:11.900
just point to this dead frog and they're like, look, you stepped on it.

18:11.900 --> 18:16.900
I was like, I don't think, well, yeah, the mob turned on me.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.900
Yeah.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.900
You're right, this is almost exactly the same.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.900
Yeah.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.900
Why did you step on the frog, though?

18:23.900 --> 18:26.900
I wanted to watch its light go out.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.900
That's somehow better than wanting attention.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.900
Also, he wanted to be the-

18:30.900 --> 18:33.900
Wanted attention.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.900
I'm the mayor of the playground now.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.900
I'm the frog.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.900
Watch me hop.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.900
Why would they have thought that it went to the tree house?

18:43.900 --> 18:45.900
Because it was a cool place to be.

18:45.900 --> 18:50.900
Maybe they had a dead frog and wanted to prank me, I don't know, but everybody else rushed

18:50.900 --> 18:53.900
up to this little tree house and yeah.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.900
Frogs live in tree house.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.900
Frogs live in tree house.

18:57.900 --> 18:58.900
True frogs do.

18:58.900 --> 18:59.900
Frogs live in tree house.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.900
That's right.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.900
And tree house frogs definitely do.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.900
Anyway, then they stoned me to death.

19:06.900 --> 19:07.900
Which is what we ended there.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.900
One of the teachers came out.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.900
Yeah, that's it.

19:11.900 --> 19:17.900
So Vernon Covington, the landlord, put you in your place both verbally and physically,

19:17.900 --> 19:25.900
and really did some serious damage to Julius and left him on the ground bleeding, coughing

19:25.900 --> 19:30.900
up his own blood, sputtering, and maybe even teeth falling out.

19:30.900 --> 19:31.900
I mean, it was bad.

19:31.900 --> 19:32.900
It was a bad scene.

19:32.900 --> 19:39.900
Before he, Vernon Covington, the landlord, did indeed call out to the judge and ask that

19:39.900 --> 19:44.900
the four of you, the three of you, Julius, whatever your last name is-

19:44.900 --> 19:45.900
Summers.

19:45.900 --> 19:46.900
Caesar.

19:46.900 --> 19:47.900
Julius the Simpsons.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.900
I almost said Caesar so many times.

19:49.900 --> 19:50.900
Summers.

19:50.900 --> 20:01.900
Julius Summers, Beck Wilder, from Cal, Colorado, as well as Stevie, or as you know her.

20:01.900 --> 20:02.900
Stevie Gotel.

20:02.900 --> 20:03.900
Well.

20:03.900 --> 20:04.900
Starts with an F.

20:04.900 --> 20:05.900
Frank Gotel.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.900
Yep, her name is-

20:06.900 --> 20:07.900
Francis.

20:07.900 --> 20:08.900
Francis Gotel.

20:08.900 --> 20:13.900
No, I almost did that before I realized I did that name in season one, so I avoided

20:13.900 --> 20:14.900
using those names.

20:14.900 --> 20:15.900
Fox.

20:15.900 --> 20:16.900
Yes.

20:16.900 --> 20:17.900
Fox is the sun.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.400
Fox is the name that the sun is going by these days.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.900
He was the one that greeted us when we got here, right?

20:22.900 --> 20:23.900
He is, yes.

20:23.900 --> 20:24.900
Oh, wait.

20:24.900 --> 20:25.900
That's Francis.

20:25.900 --> 20:26.900
Faith.

20:26.900 --> 20:27.900
Faith.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.900
That was, dude, I took a lot of fucking notes in this crazy town.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.900
That was a while back.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
Yes, Faith Gotel.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.380
Vernon Covington is asking also that Faith Gotel be stoned to death, although she is

20:38.380 --> 20:41.340
very much still in disguise to everyone here.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.380
Our last hope is Faith's friend.

20:45.380 --> 20:51.060
Faith was kind of, was she iffy about whether or not the judge was on our side or not?

20:51.060 --> 20:52.060
Yeah.

20:52.060 --> 21:00.580
Yeah, iffy, but also mentioned that for the past year, Susan Bloom, the judge, has known

21:00.580 --> 21:08.060
the whereabouts of Faith Gotel and hasn't turned on her yet, is what Faith said.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.060
Right.

21:09.060 --> 21:12.540
Maybe a friend, maybe saving her for something really juicy.

21:12.540 --> 21:13.540
Yeah.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.540
The right time to turn her in.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.700
Yep.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.340
That's the way this world goes, guys.

21:18.340 --> 21:22.500
You don't know what's really in people's hearts, who you can trust, but I think most people

21:22.500 --> 21:23.500
are good.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.500
I'm sure hope this judge isn't.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
Probably not this judge.

21:27.500 --> 21:34.100
So, yeah, I'm laying down munching on my own teeth and drinking my own blood on accident

21:34.100 --> 21:35.100
basically.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.100
Whoa.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.100
Fucking metal.

21:37.100 --> 21:38.100
Hardcore, yeah.

21:38.100 --> 21:42.920
Fucking hardcore.

21:42.920 --> 21:47.440
In this moment, the world basically freezes in your minds.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.840
It doesn't actually freeze.

21:48.840 --> 21:54.280
I know this is a natural kind of game to where if I said that and meant it, it could mean

21:54.280 --> 21:59.080
that it's real, but also I just mean, let's zoom into each of your minds real quick and

21:59.080 --> 22:02.960
get an idea of where you are at.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.440
What is rushing through your mind right now?

22:05.440 --> 22:12.200
I mean, Beck was just bleeding profusely from his leg not 15 minutes ago, and he's been

22:12.200 --> 22:15.640
cured seemingly, and now you've come out and seen this.

22:15.640 --> 22:16.640
Oh, yeah.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.960
We didn't mention it, but also we cured Cal's poison ivy because we forgot about that.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.960
Oh, yeah.

22:21.960 --> 22:22.960
Wow.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.560
Good thing they used that machine.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.800
That was a deleted scene.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.000
I lied to you just now.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.280
We didn't forget about it.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
You just got cut.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
Oh, we could easily put that in now.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
It hasn't come out yet.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
Somebody just comes in.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.280
That's true.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
Oh, that's true.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.280
That's too much work.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.280
Too much work.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.280
But it happened.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.760
Or something that doesn't need fixing because we already addressed it.

22:45.760 --> 22:46.760
Oopsie.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.240
I accidentally edited it out when I was drunk.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.240
Whoops.

22:50.240 --> 22:51.240
Uh-oh.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.680
That trashcan buttons pops out of nowhere sometimes.

22:53.680 --> 22:54.680
It's wild.

22:54.680 --> 23:00.640
You know what Hemingway said, write drunk, edit drunk.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.960
Play high.

23:03.960 --> 23:10.320
It zooms into Julius's face, and a voiceover of Julius says, you're probably wondering

23:10.320 --> 23:13.160
how I got here.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.720
Say that through your blood and teeth.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
Don't spill.

23:17.720 --> 23:22.760
You're probably wondering how I got here.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.120
I wish I knew.

23:24.120 --> 23:30.520
Julius is, he's not really got much thoughts going on in his head other than like, ow,

23:30.520 --> 23:32.240
and if I fall asleep I'll die.

23:32.240 --> 23:38.320
Yep, those are the two things that makes all the sense in the world.

23:38.320 --> 23:42.600
I feel like Beck up until this point was just kind of both weirded out but also really

23:42.600 --> 23:47.120
into everything that's been happening so far and then he fell on a jackalope and that really

23:47.120 --> 23:48.120
messed things up.

23:48.120 --> 23:56.280
But I think this is, I think this is now it's hitting him that this isn't just like accidents

23:56.280 --> 23:57.640
and hijinks and weirdness.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.480
This is life or death.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.440
This is, this is, this is no longer a news story.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.200
So weirded out here.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.240
This is all just a crazy misunderstanding.

24:07.240 --> 24:13.920
It's not just the kind of place that can cure a deep wound out of nowhere, but it's also

24:13.920 --> 24:14.920
the kind of place.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.560
It's the kind of place where you could lose your life today.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.920
And that's, that's, that's not, that's not what Beck signed up for.

24:20.920 --> 24:21.920
Yeah.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.720
What about Cal, Colorado?

24:23.720 --> 24:27.160
Cal is like stunned.

24:27.160 --> 24:34.000
He doesn't, he, he tried to make these appeals to like justice and rightness and the law

24:34.000 --> 24:42.320
and like the power of journalism to shine light on dark places and got nothing.

24:42.320 --> 24:47.360
And his head, he's, he's just rapidly like turning through different variations of those

24:47.360 --> 24:52.640
ideas and like, what if I approached them this way and appealed to their civic duty

24:52.640 --> 24:55.360
or like, yeah, but he's just grasping at straws.

24:55.360 --> 24:59.960
Will you remind me, did, did, uh, Julius do something in particular to receive that wrath

24:59.960 --> 25:02.640
or did we do something and he was the brunt of the...

25:02.640 --> 25:10.640
I did, what did I, Oh, I tried to break his cane in half and I didn't do that.

25:10.640 --> 25:16.800
And then he grabbed it and beat the shit out of me with it with my beautiful big thick

25:16.800 --> 25:17.800
thighs.

25:17.800 --> 25:21.360
I thought it would work flawlessly.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.680
I planned this character for this exact moment.

25:23.680 --> 25:28.240
I was like, will there be any cane wielding baddies?

25:28.240 --> 25:37.760
Do we look at the face or watermelon people?

25:37.760 --> 25:40.600
Just the normal role playing stuff.

25:40.600 --> 25:41.600
You never know.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.600
What's going to happen.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.600
Hold on.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.820
I got to rewrite the end of this.

25:45.820 --> 25:54.880
As the mothership's doors open, the bulbous head of watermelon prime descends slowly down

25:54.880 --> 25:56.560
stop this madness.

25:56.560 --> 26:06.720
He says, you know, we're going to invent the watermelon people language and they're aliens.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.840
So it's weird.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.120
Well they're here for our seeds, which seeds they need to cross pollinate.

26:13.120 --> 26:17.800
Their people are experiencing a children of men situation and they can't make seeds of

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
their own.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.520
So they need our watermelon seeds.

26:20.520 --> 26:24.040
You realize the first time you get one of those babies in between your thighs for too

26:24.040 --> 26:28.840
long and you're like, they're seedless.

26:28.840 --> 26:35.320
The reason they turn on us is they're like, what, what have you, you did this on purpose?

26:35.320 --> 26:39.200
They actually go to war with us because the first one to land who came in peace, Julius

26:39.200 --> 26:45.320
just like fucking raffles to the ground between his thighs and pops that fucker open.

26:45.320 --> 26:48.440
I was made for this.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.480
Oh, we're just putting off some bad things.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.480
I don't wait.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.240
Kill the frog.

26:56.240 --> 27:03.560
Are you saying that we're just procrastinating because of the, I don't want to kill me Joseph

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
because I'm Stalin.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
Oh my God.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
All right.

27:06.560 --> 27:14.240
Well we need to get Russian if we're going to get this episode done in time.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.240
Communism.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.240
Yeah.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.240
We need to quit putting it off.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.240
You'll laugh your yak off.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
Oh, that was hammering circle.

27:26.000 --> 27:36.160
All right, in Russia it says, or in America it says, in God we trust on the money in Russia.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.960
We have no money.

27:38.960 --> 27:39.960
That's Bobby Hills.

27:39.960 --> 27:40.960
Yakov joke.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.960
Yeah.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.080
He sells it to Yakov for $20.

27:45.080 --> 27:51.120
Last thing I'll say about Yakov Smirnoff is his, um, in Branson, his sign out in front

27:51.120 --> 27:55.400
of his show says, laughter kills the COVID virus.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
Wow.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.720
Is it true?

27:58.720 --> 28:03.440
I went to Yakov and I haven't had COVID since.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.840
Dangerously false sec.

28:04.840 --> 28:05.840
Oh, okay.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.840
Fascinating.

28:06.840 --> 28:12.640
Encouraging a crowd of mostly senior tourists to all expel as much air as we can in a closed

28:12.640 --> 28:13.640
space.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.000
I just listened to whoever talked to me last.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.120
So I didn't know if it was true.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.120
Oh, it's not.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.120
Thank you.

28:20.120 --> 28:25.560
Do you just want an earpiece?

28:25.560 --> 28:27.240
So the watermelon people are invading.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.240
Yeah.

28:28.240 --> 28:33.480
So you guys are looking up at what is basically now the King of the Hill, Vernon Covington,

28:33.480 --> 28:40.440
the landlord, as he is just smiling through these teeth that are fucking afraid of each

28:40.440 --> 28:41.440
other.

28:41.440 --> 28:47.360
They're so far apart and spit is just like dripping off one of his lips as he's looking

28:47.360 --> 28:49.040
down at Julia Summers.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.960
This guy sounds hot.

28:51.960 --> 28:57.520
We see the faces of people in the crowd, people in yellow, people in green.

28:57.520 --> 29:04.520
We see the two medical staff who spoke up to say that Julia Summers had tried to assault

29:04.520 --> 29:05.720
them.

29:05.720 --> 29:13.460
Pretty harsh character witness as everyone's eyes turn to the judge, Susan Bloom, who kind

29:13.460 --> 29:18.280
of almost shakily steps forward and then quickly gains her confidence.

29:18.800 --> 29:23.000
She's looking at the four of you, but you all kind of noticed, well, two of you kind

29:23.000 --> 29:30.280
of noticed mostly that she's directing her gaze at Stevie, lip quivering.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.440
Oh, hey, I didn't come up with her voice.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.440
What should I do for her?

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
What should I do for her?

29:35.440 --> 29:40.760
I'm the judge and you're going to listen to my justice.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.760
Is that what you want?

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
No.

29:43.760 --> 29:49.280
When you say judge, also based on our new artwork, I think of like a powdered wig judge,

29:49.280 --> 29:50.280
so British.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.280
I'm the judge.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.600
Wait, is she wearing a powdered wig?

29:54.600 --> 29:55.600
Powdered wig.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.600
Oh yeah.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
Powdered wig.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
Lightning blue.

29:58.600 --> 29:59.600
Black gloves.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.600
Powdered merkins.

30:00.600 --> 30:01.600
And blue high heels.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
Electric blue high heels.

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
So yeah, British.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
Joe?

30:04.600 --> 30:05.600
Yeah, British.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.600
Oh, okay.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.040
I was going to kind of combine all three of them, but yeah.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.040
Okay.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.040
Then I would say aristocrat, not cockney.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.040
Oh, Kai.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.040
God dammit.

30:15.040 --> 30:28.880
Due to all the outstanding evidence levied against these four, I do hereby charge Carol

30:28.880 --> 30:46.240
Colorado, Julius Summers, Vic Wilder, and Stevie to be stoned to death.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.240
Hell yeah.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.240
Hell yeah.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.240
Hell yeah.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.240
But also-

30:50.240 --> 30:51.240
No.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.320
It's all Julius can summer out of.

30:54.320 --> 30:59.180
You were probably the most effective person to speak up at that moment.

30:59.180 --> 31:05.740
Blood splatters up above you, spraying back down directly in your eyes as you blind yourself

31:05.740 --> 31:11.920
with your own blood spittling out of the hole in your mouth where most of your teeth used

31:11.920 --> 31:13.420
to be.

31:13.420 --> 31:17.680
The trial will commence in one hour.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.360
Didn't you just sentence us?

31:19.360 --> 31:22.400
To death for the trial.

31:22.400 --> 31:26.320
So if we lose the trial, we'll die, but we could win.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.720
Usually it's a trial, then sentencing.

31:28.720 --> 31:33.720
I sentence you to a trial by stoning.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
Yeah.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.720
It's old school.

31:35.720 --> 31:36.720
Trial by stone.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.720
If you live, you are innocent.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.680
Wait, what?

31:44.680 --> 31:45.800
I charged you.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.780
I literally already just charged you for the crime, didn't I?

31:48.780 --> 31:50.640
But that's the thing that happens in the trial.

31:50.640 --> 31:51.640
You get charged.

31:51.880 --> 31:56.440
And then you go to trial, but you sentenced us to death, which is what happens typically

31:56.440 --> 31:57.440
after a trial.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.440
Damn.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.240
But they do different things here in Grover's Court.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.240
Yeah.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.240
They tell you how you're going to die.

32:02.240 --> 32:06.900
The justice system would probably be a lot more effective if we just started with a foregone

32:06.900 --> 32:15.280
conclusion and worked our way towards that instead of-

32:15.280 --> 32:22.360
I sentence you to be tried for the death of Sandro the Turtle, our dear mayor here

32:22.360 --> 32:24.360
at Grover's Gorge.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.320
Oh, that makes more sense.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.500
The trial will commence in one hour.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.960
You may roam free until then.

32:31.960 --> 32:32.960
She looks at Vernon.

32:32.960 --> 32:33.960
That's nice.

32:33.960 --> 32:34.960
Yeah.

32:34.960 --> 32:35.960
Oh, wait.

32:35.960 --> 32:36.960
Oh, no, that's not right.

32:36.960 --> 32:42.720
Vernon's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no take backs.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.720
No take backs.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.840
You all heard her say it, right?

32:45.840 --> 32:46.840
Everybody.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
Yes.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.840
Everyone witnessed it?

32:48.840 --> 32:51.840
Julius gives a thumbs up.

32:51.840 --> 32:56.360
Your honor, might I request the defendant, Julius Summers, be allowed to receive medical

32:56.360 --> 32:57.360
attention immediately?

32:57.360 --> 32:59.920
He's in no fit shape to stand trial.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.480
Medical attention will be given.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.480
Thank you, your honor.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.000
Julius gives a rock horns.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.320
Because his other fingers are battered and broken.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.840
He's trying to hold his hand up.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.880
Well, I guess I don't know.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.960
Should they be led free until the trial or should they be thrown in?

33:19.960 --> 33:22.960
I think they should go free.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.960
Yeah, let them go.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.200
Seems like a vocal swelling of support for our freedom.

33:30.200 --> 33:36.240
It would reflect very well on you and your community if you showed this kindness to us

33:36.240 --> 33:38.320
before justice is properly expected.

33:38.320 --> 33:45.560
I will grant you each 30 seconds to plead your case and then the crowd will vote.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.600
Is this the trial or are we pleading to get like their freedom now?

33:49.600 --> 33:50.600
Is that the 30 seconds?

33:50.600 --> 33:54.960
No, this is just for pretrial bail, essentially.

33:54.960 --> 33:55.960
Quick question.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.680
Do you have your camera with the on you still?

33:58.680 --> 33:59.680
Uh huh.

33:59.680 --> 34:00.680
Yeah.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.680
I think so.

34:01.680 --> 34:02.680
Yeah, I think so.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.080
Yeah, we tried lying and saying that we were live streaming, but they called our bluff.

34:06.120 --> 34:09.960
I was probably filming that crowd before this all happened.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.720
I think you can still be filming, honestly.

34:11.720 --> 34:15.760
I just assume that Beck is literally like attached eye to camera.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.760
Agreed.

34:16.760 --> 34:20.560
I will grant you each 30 seconds to plead your case.

34:20.560 --> 34:27.240
Your Honor, petition to have Julius' 30 seconds either split between Beckworth and I or he

34:27.240 --> 34:32.680
seeks medical attention first before he's in no condition to plead any kind of case.

34:32.680 --> 34:35.840
Julius barely is able to give a thumbs up.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.520
He may go last.

34:37.520 --> 34:47.440
And she looks over to the medical staff who are the two who were

34:47.440 --> 34:54.160
like threatened by Julia Summers earlier and they are both giving the flat hand under their

34:54.160 --> 34:58.480
chin waving side to side of like, no thank you, not us.

34:58.480 --> 35:05.000
But they get on their little speaker system and call out and shortly medical staff will

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
be here to assist.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Hell yeah.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
You may begin in three, two, one, go.

35:15.000 --> 35:23.080
Well, a society that treats its imprisoned with respect is one that deserves respect.

35:23.080 --> 35:27.960
We live in a country, this is I still believe, I hope, I sincerely hope we're still in the

35:27.960 --> 35:33.960
United States, but we believe that a person here is innocent until proven guilty and I

35:33.960 --> 35:48.840
believe that we should be given time to like be not guilty for a while.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.840
You know?

35:49.840 --> 35:51.800
Cal knots vigorously.

35:51.800 --> 35:55.280
And more words, 30.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.560
Please.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.720
I bequeath my time.

36:00.720 --> 36:03.080
Yeah.

36:03.080 --> 36:08.340
And also like neither one of these big statue guys are even here.

36:08.340 --> 36:14.960
So like how do you even know what you're supposed to be doing until one of them is here to like

36:14.960 --> 36:15.960
tell you what to do.

36:15.960 --> 36:21.000
Aren't they in charge, especially with your mayor being dead as well.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.160
There's probably like no one in charge anymore time.

36:25.160 --> 36:31.520
And lastly, and at this point, Julius has been fully like, actually go ahead and roll

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
a D4.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.600
I said fully like a fool.

36:35.600 --> 36:41.480
Well, you get one hit point back, which brings you up to what?

36:41.480 --> 36:42.480
Two.

36:42.480 --> 36:46.040
Well, two is enough to talk.

36:46.040 --> 36:50.020
My mouth is mostly what's been fixed.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.800
They focus on the face.

36:52.800 --> 36:56.720
I believe that I've received punishment enough already.

36:56.720 --> 37:02.220
I mean, up until you decide whether I'm guilty or not of the crime.

37:02.220 --> 37:11.480
But I would like to have time to formulate my trial argument and I won't be running away

37:11.480 --> 37:15.000
or anything because I know what happens to bad time.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.560
All right.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.880
I need all four people.

37:19.880 --> 37:27.760
So the three of you and me is Stevie to roll persuade.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.840
I passed a 19 on a 50.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.320
I failed an 86 on a 60.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.940
I pass a 43 on a 80.

37:38.940 --> 37:41.280
And Stevie failed.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.360
So go ahead and add up your two successes.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.360
What were your successes?

37:45.360 --> 37:46.360
43.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.600
Mine was a 19.

37:47.600 --> 37:52.960
Math 62.

37:52.960 --> 37:56.440
He's just rolling until he gets more than 62.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.680
41 plus 19 is 60.

37:58.680 --> 38:04.160
I have one more role.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.240
That's a success.

38:05.240 --> 38:17.160
The crowd is seemingly on your side and vocalizations of like, Oh, maybe there's, okay, yes, now please

38:17.160 --> 38:18.700
throw up some noise.

38:18.700 --> 38:34.120
If you believe they should be let free between now and the trial, and now let's make some

38:34.120 --> 38:35.800
noise.

38:35.800 --> 38:44.520
If these four should be thrown in the pit, I don't think they should be in there.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.240
No, this is not the right move.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.040
I think we should consider a more reasoned approach.

38:49.040 --> 38:53.440
Beck is literally shushing people near him.

38:53.440 --> 39:02.760
Vernon pulls out these crazy looking handcuffs from behind his back and begins walking up

39:02.760 --> 39:07.420
behind and slaps a pair on Stevie.

39:07.420 --> 39:11.560
Can I roll another health now that they've applied it to more than my face?

39:11.560 --> 39:15.600
I think as soon as they got you up and ready to go, like able to talk.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.600
They left.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.600
Yeah.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.600
These are the guys who didn't want anything to do with you.

39:18.600 --> 39:22.940
So they just put some chapstick on you and then, yeah, I'm just kind of like, I'm sitting

39:22.940 --> 39:23.940
up now.

39:23.940 --> 39:30.420
I'm not just completely on my back, but I just let him not struggling snaps a couple.

39:30.420 --> 39:36.100
These are the same kind of like that fifties futuristic vibe of what people thought handcuffs

39:36.100 --> 39:37.220
would look like.

39:37.220 --> 39:38.220
Like laser beams?

39:38.220 --> 39:39.220
Yeah.

39:39.220 --> 39:40.220
Like an energy beam.

39:40.220 --> 39:41.220
Yeah.

39:41.220 --> 39:47.060
But it's like energy beam cuff, but there's very clearly like tubing around where the

39:47.060 --> 39:49.500
cool pulsating light is coming from.

39:49.500 --> 39:50.500
It's like fiber optic.

39:50.500 --> 39:51.500
Yeah.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.500
It's fiber optic.

39:52.500 --> 39:57.140
Cal's like, that's a little disappointing.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.900
It's a pair on Beck Wilder.

39:59.900 --> 40:02.460
Dude, bro, this seems like totally unnecessary.

40:02.460 --> 40:03.740
It's just a turtle guys.

40:03.740 --> 40:04.740
Come on.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.980
Puts your camera nicely back in its bag.

40:06.980 --> 40:10.340
Vernon Covington is weirdly nice.

40:10.340 --> 40:12.820
Like handles your camera with care.

40:12.820 --> 40:15.220
Hey man, watch the merchandise dude.

40:15.220 --> 40:17.420
Smiles up at you as he walks over to Cal.

40:17.420 --> 40:21.860
Do you think he's a home videographer?

40:21.860 --> 40:22.860
An enthusiast.

40:22.860 --> 40:26.380
He didn't know how to put it in its bag, which is kind of tricky sometimes.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.220
Hands behind your back.

40:29.220 --> 40:32.860
Beck, are you filming?

40:32.860 --> 40:33.860
It's in the bag.

40:33.860 --> 40:34.860
Oh, right.

40:34.860 --> 40:35.860
Okay.

40:35.860 --> 40:43.900
As soon as he snaps your handcuffs on, he clicks a button and all four of your handcuffs

40:43.900 --> 40:51.540
like snap together in a line where like a rod like reaches out and connects the four

40:51.540 --> 40:57.580
of you together with a leash almost on the front end of it that he grabs hold of.

40:57.580 --> 41:01.620
So it's like we're attached to an invisible foosball table arm.

41:01.620 --> 41:02.620
Yeah.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.020
That's what I was picturing.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.020
Yeah.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.020
With a leash.

41:06.020 --> 41:07.020
Yeah.

41:07.020 --> 41:13.260
And he begins leading you East away from this large lab that is made of glass and grass

41:13.260 --> 41:19.660
and toward what was described to you as the factory where the GEs work.

41:19.660 --> 41:24.140
The whole time, Cal was like, you know, some of those no votes seem to be from people sitting

41:24.140 --> 41:28.460
in a natural hollow of sorts, which amplified their, I don't think this was an accurate

41:28.460 --> 41:32.780
method of counting that vote.

41:32.780 --> 41:39.540
Vernon Covington laughs and laughs and spits on the ground and continues walking you toward

41:39.540 --> 41:43.700
this massive, massive building off in the distance.

41:43.700 --> 41:47.380
Your laughter is a very cold thing, sir.

41:47.380 --> 41:52.260
Vernon Covington laughs and spits on the ground.

41:52.260 --> 41:53.820
Somebody like called you like the landlord.

41:53.820 --> 41:55.820
You like own this place?

41:55.820 --> 42:06.340
Well, you know, I am the overseer of sorts of the GIZs around here.

42:06.340 --> 42:09.060
So you're more like a super or facilities.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.140
I'm a super landlord.

42:11.140 --> 42:12.140
Maintenance.

42:12.140 --> 42:13.140
Hmm.

42:13.140 --> 42:14.780
The name is what you make of it.

42:14.780 --> 42:22.900
I do suppose a glorified errand boy carrying out whose orders look up behind you toward

42:22.900 --> 42:27.900
the sky, your towering statues, but I understand they're not here right now.

42:27.900 --> 42:30.500
Would they be happy with this decision you've made?

42:30.500 --> 42:40.300
We'll see, yes, we'll see, oh, we'll see when you go in the it pit.

42:40.300 --> 42:48.020
We'll see if Fred Godel likes it when I have you down in the it pit.

42:48.020 --> 42:52.420
Julius, I know you're hurt, but remember that name for a future segment.

42:52.420 --> 42:53.420
Which name?

42:53.420 --> 42:54.420
The it pit.

42:54.420 --> 42:59.620
Oh, nods his head and, guys, I think my wisdom teeth grew back.

42:59.620 --> 43:05.340
Yeah, man, that machine works wonders, dude.

43:05.340 --> 43:11.380
Julius is kind of still out of it, like coming back to life, but he will remember the it

43:11.380 --> 43:13.300
pit.

43:13.300 --> 43:18.860
As you guys make it towards this factory, you see plenty of happy and chipper ease wearing

43:18.860 --> 43:25.340
their work clothes, cute little jumpsuits that are both monochromatic and have little

43:25.340 --> 43:28.860
flashes of yellow all over them, heading in and out of work.

43:28.860 --> 43:35.180
But you guys do not take the front entrance as you lead you around the back.

43:35.180 --> 43:40.740
As you walk around the back, this is the first time you've really made it toward the trees.

43:40.740 --> 43:47.780
These trees are all around, and there's just this thick, hazy fog off in the distance that

43:47.780 --> 43:52.020
you can kind of make out through the thick of the trees in the distance.

43:52.020 --> 43:59.540
He leads you around the corner of this massive facility and in the ground around back behind

43:59.540 --> 44:01.060
the factory.

44:01.060 --> 44:08.220
There are two metal doors that seem like they go down into a bomb shelter or a bunker of

44:08.220 --> 44:09.220
some sorts.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.220
Or like a pit.

44:10.220 --> 44:11.220
They're in the ground.

44:11.220 --> 44:12.220
They're in the ground.

44:12.220 --> 44:13.220
Like a hatch.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.220
Much like a hatch.

44:14.220 --> 44:17.780
A hatch that's actually in the ground.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.180
Not a SpongeBob door.

44:19.180 --> 44:24.260
This one does not have the cool wheel on it that makes a fun noise when it turns.

44:24.260 --> 44:25.260
I know.

44:25.460 --> 44:30.260
But you're just like, around back there's two doors, and then...

44:30.260 --> 44:31.260
Just I don't know.

44:31.260 --> 44:37.660
It seems like you have trouble with openings as a spatial concept.

44:37.660 --> 44:40.500
Which reminds me of another Stephen King book I read.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.740
Oh my god.

44:42.740 --> 44:54.700
He opens up one of the metal doors, opens up the other one, inside is only darkness,

44:54.700 --> 45:05.780
and out comes the most foul stench, decrepit, awful, human anatomy that's just been left

45:05.780 --> 45:14.220
out in blood that's coagulated and piss and shit and cum that's just molded over growing

45:14.220 --> 45:15.820
cultures on them.

45:15.820 --> 45:19.020
Who could cum in a place like this?

45:19.020 --> 45:22.020
And we'll answer that question on the next episode.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.020
No, it's not over yet.

45:23.020 --> 45:27.740
Yeah, we still need a closing line.

45:27.740 --> 45:29.220
This pit is not it.

45:29.220 --> 45:37.180
It kind of smells like Beck's bedroom.

45:37.180 --> 45:41.780
He takes his cane and hits Stevie in the back of one of her legs and then pushes her into

45:41.780 --> 45:42.780
the pit.

45:42.780 --> 45:43.780
Hey, whoa, bro!

45:43.780 --> 45:44.780
Boom!

45:44.780 --> 45:48.060
Immediately, the three of you just dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

45:48.060 --> 45:52.820
And if anyone can hold on, you can give it a go here, but you're being whipped down

45:52.820 --> 45:55.500
and dragged by the human weight.

45:55.500 --> 46:02.420
Kind of like we're spinning like you would spin a bunch of foosball players.

46:02.420 --> 46:06.980
We might have some leverage here, literally, because he knocked the smallest person down

46:06.980 --> 46:07.980
the stairs, presumably.

46:07.980 --> 46:14.300
There are no stairs as you look down and you just hear Stevie yelling out like, oh, ow,

46:14.300 --> 46:20.060
ow, ow, ow, and like she's screaming out because her hands were behind her, so when she went

46:20.060 --> 46:24.860
down, her hands are now above her head if you were looking down in her eye.

46:24.860 --> 46:26.500
It's a dislocated shoulder action.

46:26.500 --> 46:32.500
Yeah, Julius is the next one up, so Julius is staring down and you're seeing, I mean,

46:32.500 --> 46:38.860
her arms just snapped up fully behind to then be above her, and she's just like, oh, oh,

46:38.860 --> 46:42.380
shit, oh, just, oh, shit, oh.

46:42.380 --> 46:47.860
We're probably going to need a content warning on this episode because I'm sitting here and

46:47.860 --> 46:52.820
I'm like, I don't like being here.

46:52.820 --> 46:56.780
Julius looks at- Content warning, not fun.

46:56.780 --> 46:58.540
This one, not so fun.

46:58.540 --> 46:59.980
Not fun, man.

46:59.980 --> 47:04.540
Julius looks at the other two guys and just goes, I think we should jump.

47:04.540 --> 47:05.540
Do we have a choice?

47:05.540 --> 47:06.540
I'm confused now.

47:06.540 --> 47:08.780
Yeah, how far- Did we all go tumbling in now because of her?

47:08.780 --> 47:13.220
I think, like Thomas pointed out, he did push in the smallest one, so-

47:13.220 --> 47:14.820
Oh, so she's just like dangling by her arm.

47:14.820 --> 47:15.820
She's just dangling by her arm.

47:15.820 --> 47:16.820
That's okay.

47:16.820 --> 47:17.820
Why didn't I say nothing?

47:17.820 --> 47:18.820
Sorry, Stevie.

47:18.820 --> 47:20.460
Yeah, that's what made that happen.

47:20.460 --> 47:24.620
I thought that she had hit with such a weird impact that it had snapped her arms up.

47:24.620 --> 47:29.220
She's like dangling there while we're not- He's got his cane out, he's looking at Julius

47:29.220 --> 47:34.580
and he's just like, jump, and he lifts his cane up and they're like, he's about to hit

47:34.580 --> 47:35.580
you.

47:35.580 --> 47:38.900
Julius immediately gets a cane PTSD and he says, I think we should jump, and then he

47:38.900 --> 47:39.900
jumps.

47:39.900 --> 47:40.900
Nope.

47:40.900 --> 47:41.900
Boom.

47:41.900 --> 47:43.540
We got two and- Okay, I try to grab out.

47:43.540 --> 47:46.700
Oh, wait, I've handcuffed- Yeah, you have handcuffs on and Beck is

47:46.700 --> 47:50.780
actually next up and the two of you are the only ones standing, so I'm actually going

47:50.780 --> 47:57.900
to need strength rolls here in order for the two of you to stay up.

47:57.900 --> 48:03.540
And Vernon Covington is laughing his ass off while this happens.

48:03.540 --> 48:05.740
Cal passes a 45 on a 50.

48:05.740 --> 48:08.020
I failed a 57 on a 55.

48:08.020 --> 48:14.580
Okay, a 45 is enough to where when Beck falls in, you skirt your heels right up to the edge

48:14.580 --> 48:21.180
and are able to just hold on, but as you do so, Beck's arms are about to do the exact

48:21.180 --> 48:23.780
same thing if you don't jump at this last second.

48:23.780 --> 48:29.340
I know my hands are down behind my back, but Cal just wants to try to throw himself back

48:29.340 --> 48:35.220
and grab out with his fingers for any part of Vernon's clothes and take him down with

48:35.220 --> 48:36.220
us.

48:36.220 --> 48:37.220
Awesome.

48:37.220 --> 48:38.220
Fucking cool.

48:38.220 --> 48:39.220
That's so cool.

48:39.220 --> 48:42.860
What would that be?

48:42.860 --> 48:43.860
Grabby grabbies.

48:43.860 --> 48:47.380
Oh yeah, I've got a hundred in grabby grabbies.

48:47.380 --> 48:51.460
Well, his hands are sticky from the poison ivy, so.

48:51.460 --> 48:54.540
Right, all the pus from the poison ivy that's still here.

48:54.540 --> 48:55.540
We actually did say that.

48:55.540 --> 48:56.540
That's why we cured it, I forgot.

48:56.540 --> 48:57.540
Yeah, I know.

48:57.540 --> 48:58.540
I know.

48:58.540 --> 48:59.540
I'm talking.

48:59.540 --> 49:00.540
Ooh, I'm talking.

49:00.540 --> 49:01.540
That's what I'm...

49:01.540 --> 49:02.540
I'm talking.

49:02.540 --> 49:03.540
Shut up.

49:03.540 --> 49:04.540
I'm talking here.

49:04.540 --> 49:05.540
No.

49:05.540 --> 49:09.380
No, you said what I said before I said it.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.380
The bear.

49:10.380 --> 49:11.380
That's pretty good.

49:11.380 --> 49:12.820
So yeah, what should I roll here?

49:13.260 --> 49:16.340
You should roll athletics or decks.

49:16.340 --> 49:19.140
Okay, I'm going to roll dexterity.

49:19.140 --> 49:20.140
Yep.

49:20.140 --> 49:24.020
Got a 45 in that.

49:24.020 --> 49:25.580
And I rolled a 70.

49:25.580 --> 49:26.580
So I'm going to spend my luck.

49:26.580 --> 49:28.860
Wait, yeah, to change that to a seven.

49:28.860 --> 49:29.860
Right.

49:29.860 --> 49:30.860
Which is great because he crit fails.

49:30.860 --> 49:31.860
Oh, fuck yes.

49:31.860 --> 49:32.860
Holy shit.

49:32.860 --> 49:38.860
All right, because he crit fails, I'm going to say Beck keeps his arms, which is very

49:38.860 --> 49:39.980
nice for Beck.

49:39.980 --> 49:40.980
You're able to grab him.

49:40.980 --> 49:42.580
They were going to be ripped out of their sockets?

49:42.580 --> 49:43.580
Yeah, they were.

49:43.580 --> 49:44.580
Did mine?

49:44.580 --> 49:45.580
Did mine already do that?

49:45.580 --> 49:46.580
Actually, fuck.

49:46.580 --> 49:47.580
Ouchie.

49:47.580 --> 49:54.620
I would say it's not a foregone conclusion that your arms would dislocate in this position.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.820
Yeah, you could come up.

49:56.820 --> 50:00.460
Well, when he put the cuffs on me, they were in front of me.

50:00.460 --> 50:01.460
Oh, nice.

50:01.460 --> 50:02.460
That was nice.

50:02.460 --> 50:03.460
That worked out well for you.

50:03.460 --> 50:04.460
Yeah.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.580
Because I was like, my arms hurt too bad to put them on the way back there.

50:07.580 --> 50:11.420
So you just have your arms raised normally above your head.

50:11.420 --> 50:13.140
It's uncomfortable, but it's not terrible.

50:13.140 --> 50:17.660
Yeah, you were able to hold on to the in-between connection.

50:17.660 --> 50:23.180
So yeah, as Kal is slipping off, he just manages to get three little fingers around

50:23.180 --> 50:24.180
a belt.

50:24.180 --> 50:25.180
Inside the vest.

50:25.180 --> 50:26.180
Yeah.

50:26.180 --> 50:27.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:27.180 --> 50:28.180
And he just yanks him off with us.

50:28.180 --> 50:29.180
Boom.

50:29.180 --> 50:30.180
And with the belt in your hands.

50:30.180 --> 50:31.180
I jack him off into the gumpit.

50:31.180 --> 50:32.180
Okay.

50:32.180 --> 50:33.460
Oh, fuck, dude.

50:33.460 --> 50:38.340
He can't get both doors, but also because he crit fails there, he's trying to grab on

50:38.340 --> 50:42.340
to one of the doors for any sort of like leverage on the ground, right?

50:42.340 --> 50:44.780
But that just ends up shutting one of them.

50:44.780 --> 50:49.060
And slamming his fingers and breaking his hands, right?

50:49.060 --> 50:50.060
Why not?

50:50.060 --> 50:51.060
Yeah.

50:51.060 --> 50:52.060
Hands.

50:52.060 --> 50:53.060
Fingers, maybe.

50:53.060 --> 50:54.060
Knees and toes.

50:54.060 --> 50:59.580
As he comes down, he's got his fingers just on the edge, but then that door that he pulled

50:59.580 --> 51:04.940
up just comes down and slices off all of his fingertips.

51:04.940 --> 51:06.100
Slices them off?

51:06.100 --> 51:07.100
Yeah.

51:07.100 --> 51:15.580
And as you guys all hit the ground, he's just, whoa, oh my, oh shit, oh my goodness, oh no,

51:15.580 --> 51:16.780
oh my God.

51:16.780 --> 51:20.480
And you look over and there's just very little light in here.

51:20.480 --> 51:25.020
The only light that is actually coming through is coming in through one of the empty doors

51:25.020 --> 51:26.020
that is above you.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.460
So light is pouring in through that.

51:27.460 --> 51:34.360
And you see that Vernon Covington shoves his fingers into what is the ground, but what

51:34.360 --> 51:42.320
is essentially just a layer of, okay, so like the amount of skin that sloughs off of

51:42.320 --> 51:51.680
a human in like a certain amount of time, like leaves a certain amount of skin waste.

51:51.680 --> 51:52.680
Mostly what dust is.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
Most of the dust in your house.

51:53.680 --> 51:54.680
Yeah.

51:54.680 --> 51:58.840
This place be dusty and the dust is basically turned to mud.

51:58.840 --> 51:59.840
Yeah.

51:59.840 --> 52:00.840
Because of all the shit and blood and common piss.

52:00.840 --> 52:02.840
Because of all the shit and blood and common piss.

52:02.840 --> 52:03.840
Yeah.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.320
You've got a pretty good idea of what that sounds like in here.

52:05.320 --> 52:06.320
Oh, did we say puss?

52:06.320 --> 52:08.320
Oh, and it'd be a lot of that too.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.320
Snot.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.320
There would absolutely be a fair amount of snot and puss.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.320
That's just some puss.

52:11.320 --> 52:12.320
Kind of puss really.

52:12.320 --> 52:13.320
It's all white blood cells.

52:13.320 --> 52:14.320
Interesting.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.320
Yeah.

52:15.320 --> 52:17.320
And probably a bunch of skin cells in there too.

52:17.320 --> 52:18.320
Yeah.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.320
Yeah.

52:19.320 --> 52:20.320
So we got it double covered.

52:20.320 --> 52:23.320
I'm going to go ahead and say roll grip.

52:23.320 --> 52:24.320
Okay.

52:24.320 --> 52:36.480
I wanted to pass this so bad because that could be okay with a certain degree of this.

52:36.480 --> 52:37.480
But I did not.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.360
I'm an 83 on a 63.

52:39.360 --> 52:44.040
Cal, Colorado is not okay with this at all and critically fails.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.680
77 on a 56.

52:46.680 --> 52:49.580
I got a 41 on a 45.

52:49.580 --> 52:52.780
Congratulations Julia Summers.

52:52.780 --> 52:53.780
He's in too much pain.

52:53.780 --> 52:57.260
And like half blind and can't really tell what's going on.

52:57.260 --> 53:04.300
Literally the thoughts on my mind are who came down here with us and my wisdom teeth

53:04.300 --> 53:08.940
hurts so bad right now.

53:08.940 --> 53:17.740
You lose one grip, Beck, you failed, which means you lose one D4 plus one and Cal, because

53:17.740 --> 53:23.540
you critically failed, you lose the most for this role, which is five.

53:24.020 --> 53:28.780
I got the most and it looks like Joe, I got the most too.

53:28.780 --> 53:37.700
And I got a chance to not have the most and I got the most.

53:37.700 --> 53:38.700
That's a big old fiver.

53:38.700 --> 53:43.260
Hey, Zach, that also makes me hit my bow breaking point.

53:43.260 --> 53:45.020
I'm one away from my breaking point.

53:45.020 --> 53:48.180
Oh, why did I tell that's for the audience, Zach.

53:48.180 --> 53:49.180
Don't listen to that.

53:49.180 --> 53:51.600
I don't get any ideas, mister.

53:51.600 --> 53:55.200
So we're going to have the cover Joe's breaking point here, and we're also going to have to

53:55.200 --> 53:58.840
take care of fight flight or freeze.

53:58.840 --> 54:00.280
Okay.

54:00.280 --> 54:03.080
So that's a three, two, one, right?

54:03.080 --> 54:07.040
So three fight, two freeze, one flee.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.040
Okay.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.420
Do I do that because of the breaking point?

54:09.420 --> 54:12.280
You do that because you lost five as well.

54:12.280 --> 54:18.160
Losing five grip in one go means you got to roll that fight flight freeze.

54:18.160 --> 54:23.600
It is going to be Beck's first because you don't want to be in this pit.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.720
Freeze would be a second and third is fight.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.720
Yep.

54:26.720 --> 54:27.720
Beck got a two, which was freeze.

54:27.720 --> 54:28.720
Your name's Cal.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.440
Oh, Cal got a two.

54:31.440 --> 54:39.880
That's not going to stop the shippers or just one now call me by your name.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.680
Let me eat your arm.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.360
So you are doing what now?

54:44.360 --> 54:45.360
You're freezing.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.360
Yeah.

54:46.360 --> 54:50.480
Cal feels a brief moment of triumph as he drags the landlord down with them.

54:50.480 --> 54:55.900
But then as soon as he sees what's in this pit, instead of trying to beat him to death,

54:55.900 --> 55:01.840
he just looks around every part of his face drops and he just stands there silently crying.

55:01.840 --> 55:07.040
And I think that in this moment, as you're standing there crying, it's one of those you're

55:07.040 --> 55:12.880
in here with me, I'm not in here with you situations as you realize that you have brought

55:12.880 --> 55:20.480
down a person who has been capable of extreme violence, whose hands are not cuffed.

55:20.480 --> 55:23.320
Yeah, but his fucking fingers are cut off.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.320
Yeah.

55:24.320 --> 55:31.160
It's not going to help as I try to beat the shit out of you guys until you die.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.560
Weird call, but I like it.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.560
Beck Wilder.

55:33.560 --> 55:39.000
I mean, you're going to have to tell me how much you allow in the handcuffs, but Beck

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
rolled a one.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.280
Oh, that's the fucking-

55:43.120 --> 55:46.040
Joe business right there.

55:46.040 --> 55:49.680
He's going to try and start kicking and headbutting Vernon.

55:49.680 --> 55:54.320
He is far too concerned with his current situation right now to fight back.

55:54.320 --> 56:00.520
So you've got a free shot on him and because you're going with just like unbridled lack

56:00.520 --> 56:06.080
of grip on reality here, you are going to act in basically what is a surprise round

56:06.080 --> 56:09.640
before we get into combat.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.640
Especially no one.

56:10.640 --> 56:18.080
Beck is not a combat person, so I can roll unarmed combat, which you get a natural 40%

56:18.080 --> 56:19.080
in.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.080
That's not a bad score.

56:20.080 --> 56:25.200
I would argue that I'm literally not using my arms, so maybe it's just like strength.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.200
Leg combat?

56:26.200 --> 56:29.040
No, I'm going to call that unarmed combat.

56:29.040 --> 56:30.040
Yeah.

56:30.040 --> 56:31.040
If you're not using your arms, man.

56:31.040 --> 56:34.040
It's super unarmed.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.480
Head and leg only.

56:36.480 --> 56:39.080
I could see like pure violence also being a strength roll.

56:39.080 --> 56:40.080
I passed it.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.080
It's a 12.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.080
Oh, that's great.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.080
It's uncontested.

56:43.080 --> 56:48.400
Can I headbutt him unconscious?

56:48.400 --> 56:52.000
You can give him one great headbutt hopefully here.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.760
Go ahead and roll a- what is a headbutt worth?

56:56.760 --> 57:01.120
Oh, that's a D100.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.320
You haven't seen Beck's head.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.520
It's going to be a D4 minus one.

57:04.520 --> 57:06.640
Just give us a D4.

57:06.640 --> 57:07.640
Nice.

57:07.640 --> 57:08.640
So three total.

57:09.200 --> 57:17.000
So Vernon Covington takes three damage as you- I mean through the slop in the mud beneath

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
your feet.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.720
Do you want to describe how Beck headbutts Vernon Covington?

57:22.720 --> 57:26.560
I mean, since his hands are behind his back and he's attached to all these guys, it's

57:26.560 --> 57:29.320
going to be a weird kind of lunge forward.

57:29.320 --> 57:34.120
He might even lose his feet for a second to get enough momentum to bring everybody forward

57:34.120 --> 57:35.120
with him.

57:35.120 --> 57:38.480
And he just kind of supermances his head into Vernon's head.

57:38.480 --> 57:42.720
And since he connects, I think that he can stay on his feet because of that.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.640
If he had missed, he would have gone face down past him.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.520
Vernon just failed to stay standing.

57:48.520 --> 57:53.080
He is on his back prone and will now act last in this turn.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.480
What is your guys' dexterity?

57:54.480 --> 57:55.480
45.

57:55.480 --> 57:56.480
75.

57:56.480 --> 57:57.480
Mine's a 50.

57:57.680 --> 58:05.960
So first up, Stevie fucking just starts stomping on Vernon Covington's face and it's Julius

58:05.960 --> 58:07.020
Summers' turn.

58:07.020 --> 58:11.440
I want to point out real fast- That's what I wanted to do if I wasn't present.

58:11.440 --> 58:14.760
Just for the record, there's no way that Beck can say this in person, but I'll say it out

58:14.760 --> 58:16.680
of character because I want us all to be aware.

58:16.680 --> 58:20.960
There's no reason- like now we're definitely going to be sentenced to death if we get out

58:20.960 --> 58:21.960
of here.

58:21.960 --> 58:28.600
This is us killing or naming the landlord.

58:28.600 --> 58:30.160
He brought us here on his own.

58:30.160 --> 58:31.720
It's our word against his.

58:31.720 --> 58:35.760
He brought us to their fucking weird cum shit torture pit.

58:35.760 --> 58:44.120
Oh, you know, he tried to hit us and fuck us with a dead guy's arm or whatever.

58:44.120 --> 58:47.600
So yeah, it was self-defense and we ended up beating him to death.

58:47.600 --> 58:50.320
Sorry, but maybe you should have a real police force here.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.320
I don't know.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.040
It's better to ask for forgiveness.

58:54.040 --> 58:58.560
I'm glad you said it, but like Julius does not think of that at all.

58:58.560 --> 58:59.560
Thank you.

58:59.560 --> 59:06.640
But now it's like everything I do, I'm like, damn, it's stupid to do this.

59:06.640 --> 59:14.440
As your turn turns the corner here, you see that Stevie is performing an act that is making

59:14.440 --> 59:19.840
Vernon Covington look in role-playing parlance bloodied.

59:19.840 --> 59:27.120
Julius is going to, for lack of a better term, I'm going to straddle his head and try to

59:27.120 --> 59:29.400
just crush his head between my legs.

59:29.400 --> 59:34.720
Foreshadowing the triumphant end of the campaign when he defeats the watermelon people.

59:34.720 --> 59:39.160
Now see, this is a strength roll.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.160
28 on 50.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.160
Holy shit.

59:49.480 --> 59:50.480
Okay.

59:50.480 --> 59:55.800
So because what you're going for here is full-blown like head smash.

59:55.800 --> 59:58.600
Like skull fracturing head smash.

59:58.600 --> 59:59.600
Yeah.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.160
I'm going to have him roll constitution.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.600
So you are going to do one D4 minus one damage.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600
One.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.600
Okay.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.760
So you do one damage to him.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:16.440
You are squeezing his head so hard that his actually, his a tipless fingers are now like

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.960
reaching out for you.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:26.480
But every single time that he actually tries to grab onto you, he's cause it hurts so fucking

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.560
bad when he's trying to reach out.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560
Well good.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.920
Cal, Colorado, you are frozen.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.440
What is going through your brain is you're unable to act in this turn.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:44.080
I guess Cal is kind of being dragged around by everybody on this line, but he's not really

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.640
seeing what's in front of his face.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:50.120
He's just remembering conversations with like his ex wife where she's like, one day this

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.120
job is going to get you killed.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.280
Like one day you're going to be in a situation where you couldn't say no and you're going

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.600
to pay the price.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.120
There's more important things, Cal.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.080
There's more fucking important things than that job.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:09.560
And he's not quite like ready to accept that, but that's all he's seen in his mind at the

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.600
top of the next round.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:19.840
Vernon reaches out his fingerprintless fingers, trying to grasp and find his cane and he successfully

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.160
does so.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:28.600
And when he goes to use it on Julius Summers, wrapped so tightly around his face, he is

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.000
fully unable to quite figure out where Julius is still.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.280
He's just whipping his arm around randomly and confusedly.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.800
He's freaking out.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.960
The guy can't even fucking breathe right now and he's losing his absolute shit.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.760
I don't think you're going to be able to hit me with your cane.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.760
Got him.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.760
Bible stuff.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.760
Bible slam.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760
Yeah.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760
Total Bible slam.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.760
Fucking got him.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.800
Interesting character choice at this time to make Julius religious.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.480
He's losing it a little bit.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.720
Julius is deeply Christian.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.240
Stevie straight up, she was stomping on the face, but the face is taken.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:17.600
So she jumps into the air with both feet coming right down on Vernon Covington's ribs and

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.840
you hear just crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.840
Holy shit.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.840
And he just...

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
Spatchcock.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.840
Julius Summers.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840
Finish him.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840
Finish him.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.840
Finish him.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840
Finish him.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.840
Finish him.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.840
Finish him.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.840
Finish him.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:32.840
Finish him.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.840
Finish him.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Finish him.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
Finish him.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960
Finish him.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.400
Julius avoids the cane and kind of like kicks his foot trying to knock it out of his hand,

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.080
repositions and then just full force squeeze again.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080
Oh, give me that.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.360
Give me that strength.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.200
That'll be a three minus one, two.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Oh, wait, I got to do strength check.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.200
Strength check.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.200
Yeah.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200
45 on a 50.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.240
I succeeded as well, but only with a 10.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240
Nice.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240
And you rolled?

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.680
I rolled a three minus one.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.200
Plus one, which is two.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.560
He's going to roll a constitution to stay conscious and he fails.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:19.320
The muffled screams of Vernon Covington, the landlord, begin to slowly fade into the enormous

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.920
thighs of Julius Summers.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.680
Do you stay on top of him?

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.480
Julius doesn't stop squeezing until he, his eyes are finally adjusting to the dim light

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.480
in here and he's going to wait until he sees eyeballs pop out.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.040
Just continuously squeezing.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.600
I can't see his eyes.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600
His eyes are in your teeth.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.880
And just medically that might not be what happens.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.080
I know, but it's not a, this isn't a medical podcast.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:54.920
Actually, this is, this is a spinoff of Sawbones.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.720
Uh, yeah, Julius is just going to keep doing it until basically until somebody pulls him

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.080
Just continuously squeezing.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080
Julius stop.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.080
We're out of combat now, right?

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080
Yeah.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.960
Julius, Julius, he's worth more to us dead.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:19.840
I mean, he's worth moral to the world dead, but to us right now he's worth more alive.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.520
He's our only bargaining chip.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.080
Julius gives like one last little squeeze and then stands up and just spits on his face.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:34.440
Even the force of your spit hitting the back of his head makes his eyeballs explode.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.000
That's how science works.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.280
He spits on his face that kind of looks like a pug, like, you know, smashed with eyeballs

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.300
kind of smashed out.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.080
You know how those ugly little pugs look?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080
Yeah.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.080
You know, with their eyeballs.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.080
With their eyeballs almost hanging out of their head.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.080
Yeah.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.080
Like that.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080
So he's cute.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:05:00.160
We beat him into adorableness took a lot, took a lot.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:10.160
And as your eyes adjust to this low lighting down here in the pit, you see that all over

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:23.080
every single wall are the same cryptic designs over and over and over seems to be drawn in

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.080
whatever it is that's below you making up the ground here, slathered on these walls.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:35.640
And I'm going to, I'm going to send it in the group and let you guys describe it that

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.640
way.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.640
I don't give anything away.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.640
Okay.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.640
Just send it.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.640
Yeah.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.640
It's it's his dick.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.880
It's just kind of looks like a tongue.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.880
How's my dog?

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.880
Yeah.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880
Uh, five.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.880
Nice stars.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.800
You got to take care of that tongue thing, man.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Okay.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:01.760
So we've got like a big spiral and in the center of the spiral looks like what is like,

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:08.920
what's the castle thing called a rook from a chest like a rampart.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.680
No, it's like a castle tower, the top of a tower of a castle.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:18.480
Well, it's, it's like the teen Titans tower, but wearing a crown.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.480
Yeah.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.280
Or maybe you can't see its head and those are its shoulders and it's, it's bar mitzvah

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.600
and it's wearing that, that thing, that sash you wear anyway.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.680
That's in the middle.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:34.480
And then like coming out of the spiral from the middle is a star, a perfectly drawn, like

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.480
five point star, like a kid would draw.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:42.720
And then going, I mean, I drew it, so fuck you.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:49.600
Moving on the spiral line, the next thing you get is like, like basically a V, but in

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.600
the bottom of the V is a diamond or like the, uh, Mason's symbol.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600
It's a square.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.600
Yeah.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.920
Not like a square shape, like a, a, a, the square tool, I guess I'm looking at it.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920
Okay.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920
Yeah.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:10.800
And then continuing on the spiral is, am I looking at it this way or this way?

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:17.680
It's like a lowercase teen Titans tower upside down.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.400
Then there's like a wall with a gate, maybe some kind of doorway.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.200
There's a line with what looks like a door in it maybe, but I think it's a wall with

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.200
a door.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200
It kind of looks like a field.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.200
Yeah.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.680
Like a, like an archway in a field.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:35.360
Yeah, that could be, you know, the kid who drew this.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.360
And then basically, uh, an upside down cross.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.440
No, that's the lowercase teen Titans tower.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.080
That's a hammer.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.080
Oh, okay.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.080
Yeah.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080
Yeah.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.680
And we'll post this picture on Instagram at pretending pod on Twitter at pretending pod.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.680
Zach, are you okay?

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.760
You actually drew this on your walls.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760
Yeah.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.240
Uh, Thomas isn't making a joke.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.400
The picture that he sent us is him standing next to a white wall that he has drawn this

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400
on.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400
Yeah.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400
With my piss and shit and comments.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.400
It is Brown.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.400
A little blood.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.280
It looks like it wouldn't be the whole stew with who took this picture.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.280
Taylor.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.120
No, I took that long arms.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.120
Oh, whoa.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:20.560
You must have, I'm sorry, but that's a selfie all day long, Betty.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.320
It just looks like his shoulders are both like that shoulder does look like it's going

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.320
straight down.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:31.560
It's, it's all elbow.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.880
And to get enough of you and my forearms, three feet long.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.720
So do we see one of those or a bunch of those?

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:45.560
You see those just all over, like spiral to spiral covering the entirety of the walls

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.840
and they all have these little designs drawn slightly differently, but in the exact same

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:55.880
spots over and over and over and over.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.640
I are you okay?

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.640
Cause like this is not a compelling symbol.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.760
This is actually what a crazy person would make.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.760
Honestly, thank you so much.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.800
Thank you so much.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.800
That is exactly what I was going for.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:17.800
Top to bottom nonsense with a very poor overall like sense of composition.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:10:00.440
Whew.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.600
I'm sweaty.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.240
I am also very sweaty.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.920
And I am pee.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.920
I am pee.
