00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
Greetings, Dream Babies!

00:02.260 --> 00:05.260
It's your sleepy daddy, Wolf the Dog,

00:05.260 --> 00:08.840
and I am here to snooze 18 hours a day

00:08.840 --> 00:11.940
and eat garbage for the six waking hours.

00:11.940 --> 00:14.520
As for the other four hours in the day?

00:14.520 --> 00:18.180
Well, I try to catch up on my math lessons.

00:18.180 --> 00:23.700
I am yawning at you live from 694.2 PTBP,

00:23.700 --> 00:29.500
the only radio station that definitely penetrates your sleep brainwaves

00:29.500 --> 00:32.500
even when the radio is turned off.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.260
This week's Howlin' with Wolf is from Ain't Slayed Nobody,

00:36.260 --> 00:40.340
a new actual play podcast playing Down Darker Trails,

00:40.340 --> 00:43.300
the Old West setting for Call of Cthulhu.

00:43.300 --> 00:47.640
They done gone and tagged that pretendin' pod in a tweet, ya hear?

00:47.640 --> 00:52.100
That's some Western talk for you cowpokes out there.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.140
They write,

00:53.140 --> 00:54.440
Dear Wolf,

00:54.440 --> 00:58.180
Isn't it time for a pretendin' to be pups spinoff?

00:58.300 --> 01:01.500
Think of the subscriber counts before you answer.

01:01.500 --> 01:06.800
Anyway, we reckon we were more excited than popcorn on a hot stove

01:06.800 --> 01:08.640
when we earned this announcement.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.480
We have some things in common,

01:10.480 --> 01:14.640
being a comedy horror podcast where we pretend to be people.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.520
In our case, cowpokes, drifters, prospectors.

01:18.520 --> 01:23.700
But the setting don't matter a lick when death is knockin' down the door.

01:23.700 --> 01:27.000
Bein' is where the new kid's on the plane.

01:27.020 --> 01:32.240
We'd sure appreciate anyone who lets us bend their ear for an episode or two.

01:32.240 --> 01:37.700
Did we detect a little Texan accent there beneath the grit, Wolf?

01:37.700 --> 01:43.040
Via con diablos, your friends at Ain't Slayed Nobody.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.700
Now listen here, bub.

01:44.700 --> 01:50.420
I don't do anything I do for some kind of subscriber count.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.040
I do everything I do to whet my own whistle.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.800
But I digress.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.020
That sounds like an interestin' settin' y'all got there.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.520
The Old West.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.400
This Texas you speak of.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.980
I feel as though I may have been there in a past life.

02:09.980 --> 02:11.560
Or a future one.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.520
I have been all places at all times at some point, I am sure.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.240
My existence is persistent like that.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.000
Anyway, it sounds like a good time.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.620
I wish I knew what the fuckin' internet was so I could see a goddamn podcast.

02:28.620 --> 02:35.180
Just a simple tweet with a tag somewhere in it or an Instagram story at Pretending Pod.

02:35.180 --> 02:36.180
That's all it takes.

02:36.180 --> 02:39.640
And then you can write up something for your old Wolfie to howl.

02:39.640 --> 02:44.280
Plus, all your followers will know what kind of filth you're into.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.540
Disclosure is good, my babies.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.280
Disclosure and money.

02:49.280 --> 02:52.680
Wolf the dog has an odd relationship with money.

02:52.680 --> 02:58.400
Paper money is crazy and I don't understand how nobody uses it.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.560
But coin money?

02:59.560 --> 03:03.040
Now that's some shit you can get some grease on, baby.

03:03.040 --> 03:08.160
Grease up them coins and throw them in the bathtub and have yourself a good old time.

03:08.160 --> 03:13.840
And speaking of money, you can use some of yours to support the show over on patreon.com

03:13.840 --> 03:15.800
slash pretending pod.

03:15.800 --> 03:22.400
The month of May will be particularly blessed with an edited bonus episode wherein the boys

03:22.440 --> 03:27.040
take on a legendary house in Call of Cthulhu's The Haunting.

03:27.040 --> 03:34.360
As well as part one and part two, if all goes well, of the scenario voted on by the patrons

03:34.360 --> 03:41.800
Caleb Stokes, lover in the ice, a delta green favorite that gets nasty real quick.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.780
Those in the den of sin can expect a behind the scenes live stream of the recording process

03:46.780 --> 03:50.180
for part two of that game in the next few weeks.

03:50.180 --> 03:56.860
To the den of sin now and see the recorded stream of part one as soon as you join, if

03:56.860 --> 04:03.900
you want to see how the sausage gets played, patreon.com slash pretending pod.

04:03.900 --> 04:11.700
If that felt like an advertisement, then squeeze that grip tighter until I bloop out the news.

04:11.700 --> 04:18.100
Those gosh dang contention police officers woke up in Ari Manstein's tomb again.

04:18.100 --> 04:24.000
It's the third time this story, what in the holy time traveling fuck is going on?

04:24.000 --> 04:28.840
They saved an old woman from a freakishly long limb creature in a black suit.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.640
Wow, that's nice.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
Then she died.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.200
That's not as nice.

04:33.200 --> 04:38.400
Keith, John, and Clark tried to convince an otherworldly being they were its deceased

04:38.400 --> 04:40.320
co-worker, Jim Cook.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.080
Realizing quickly that Keith was not Jim, the creature tried to get some info, but due

04:45.080 --> 04:50.440
to the lack of perspective, mostly just fucked with them, knowing it was going to wipe the

04:50.440 --> 04:53.460
memories of the past week at the end of the encounter.

04:53.460 --> 04:57.180
But did our beloved heroes allow themselves to be brain mopped?

04:57.180 --> 04:59.820
Abso-fucking-lutely not.

04:59.820 --> 05:01.900
They remember everything.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.420
And then Drew Andrews pulled up.

05:05.420 --> 05:11.740
A few folks on the fine internet dropped the line to say Drew sounded too confident.

05:11.740 --> 05:17.360
Others suggested this was a more worldly Drew, like he'd seen some shit.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.600
I can't see shit either.

05:19.600 --> 05:26.720
Just a hot pile of yes please and a head full of kudzu with no backbone.

05:41.740 --> 06:04.560
Hey everybody, it's time for episode 77 with my best friends, Thomas and Luke and Joe and

06:04.560 --> 06:05.640
everybody.

06:05.640 --> 06:11.600
We can't sing on the Zoom call together cause there's lag and you can't sing with me.

06:11.600 --> 06:21.320
Do you want to go ahead and get a cut of you introducing that better?

06:21.320 --> 06:27.080
Thomas can suck my dick, I would like it, he is my least favorite person in the world

06:27.080 --> 06:32.460
except for he's not, I am a dirty liar and I love him so dearly and I miss kissing his

06:32.460 --> 06:33.460
face.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.460
Oh boy.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.460
Face.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.460
Me.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.600
I miss kissing your faces too.

06:38.600 --> 06:43.480
I wanted to start today with a quick game where we try to kiss each other's faces.

06:43.480 --> 06:51.120
So we play the Price is Right rules with the mechanics of this game so real quick I want

06:51.120 --> 07:00.240
everyone to answer on like 3, 2, 1 you say us or you on who wins a roll.

07:00.240 --> 07:08.000
So who wins if I roll a 52 on a 50 and you roll a 51 on a 60?

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
3, 2, 1.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Us.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Yes, nice.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Us.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.440
And if I roll a 0, 7 on a 40 and you roll a 45 on a 45?

07:16.440 --> 07:17.440
Us.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.440
Us.

07:18.440 --> 07:23.360
And if I roll a 44 on a 70 and you roll an 11 on a 50?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
Us.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.640
I don't know on that one actually.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.900
I think you, it's two crits versus you get the higher crit.

07:30.900 --> 07:31.900
What happens?

07:31.900 --> 07:34.560
In two crit situations the higher crit wins.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
You.

07:35.560 --> 07:36.880
Unless it's a 1.

07:36.880 --> 07:37.880
Unless it's a 1.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.680
I've got one last one for you.

07:40.680 --> 07:48.600
If I roll a 0, 1 on a 10 and you roll a 69 on a 60?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
Us.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.600
Us.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.840
Because that's a crit fail for us.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.720
No, no, isn't 69 always a critical success, right?

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
I don't know that one.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
And it trumps all of these?

07:58.720 --> 07:59.880
No, does it trump all others?

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
It trumps a 1?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.640
We've never, I guess it does.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.880
It's the crit.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.880
It's the crit.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.880
It's the crit.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.680
So thank you.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.880
You all did very well, almost perfect.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.580
But yeah, no, it's good to get that out.

08:15.580 --> 08:18.160
A solid C.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.200
So here are your degrees.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.200
Who's it signed by?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.680
Oh gosh, who would it be signed by?

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
The Hamburglar.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.680
Zach.

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
Zacho.

08:26.680 --> 08:33.840
This is great, I feel like we're in the last scene of A New Hope where they're getting

08:33.840 --> 08:34.840
their awards.

08:34.840 --> 08:38.600
Yeah, so if you could all just bend down.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.640
I was trying to remember a scene in New Hope where they were like quizzing each other on

08:42.640 --> 08:43.640
numbers.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.640
I couldn't come up with that scene.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.600
It's when they were trying to get into Mensa.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.560
Chewie loses.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.160
He freaks out.

08:52.160 --> 08:59.440
Drew just pulled up in the red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse, rolls down the window, hello contention

08:59.440 --> 09:02.920
police officers, please get in the car and come with me.

09:02.920 --> 09:03.920
Drew.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
So good to see you, Drew.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Wait, what?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.480
You are, and you are, and you, who are you?

09:10.480 --> 09:18.800
Oh, hey Drew, well, I'm John Lee Kevin Moore in a manner of speaking.

09:18.800 --> 09:29.680
You see, Kevin was Marvin Glass's main enforcer along with Rosemary, but he was actually the

09:29.680 --> 09:36.080
lobotomized, I mean, completely brain-removed body of my, of my father.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.000
Oh my god.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
This is John.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.840
I'm John, yeah, I'm John, and I'm in this body now.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.000
John Lee Pettymore, the missing John Lee Pettymore?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.560
Is that what they're calling me?

09:48.560 --> 09:53.840
Well, John Lee Pettymore the third disappeared so long ago and everyone just assumed he died.

09:53.840 --> 09:54.840
Right.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
I...

09:55.840 --> 09:57.040
Yes, he did, right?

09:57.040 --> 09:58.040
I don't understand.

09:58.440 --> 10:05.360
Well, I'm looking at you right now, I'm so, but you're saying that you are, now Drew has

10:05.360 --> 10:14.400
been through a lot with you guys, and he did, in fact, witness the Cat Man switching bodies,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.160
so this is, um...

10:16.160 --> 10:18.800
He can roll with the idea of somebody being in somebody else's body.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
I like what you're saying here.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.800
A little bit better, yeah.

10:20.800 --> 10:26.520
He's gonna be able to slightly understand that, and so John Lee Pettymore the fourth

10:26.520 --> 10:35.400
is in the body of John Lee Pettymore the third, and your body is, where's your body?

10:35.400 --> 10:39.480
Well, my body was rendered useless.

10:39.480 --> 10:44.640
You know what, we can get into all this later, I don't really know if we have time to explain

10:44.640 --> 10:46.120
ball to you.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.280
What's contention like?

10:47.280 --> 10:51.560
Oh, we have to get back, I mean, we are in desperate need of help.

10:51.880 --> 10:59.400
Okay, so contention is working still, yes, of course, and we're working on puddle teaming

10:59.400 --> 11:02.200
everywhere, so basically what we gotta do-

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
Puddle teaming?

11:03.200 --> 11:07.200
Puddle teaming, yeah, so you guys should probably come, I mean, that's why I'm here, I'm here

11:07.200 --> 11:11.680
to come get you so that you can come back to contention and help, because you are the

11:11.680 --> 11:15.760
only police officers that we had, and you all abandoned us, and I wanted to come find

11:15.760 --> 11:19.360
you and bring you back so that you could help us, thank you so much for doing that, but

11:19.360 --> 11:28.800
we have these deep man-made puddles all over contention so that if somebody sees the residue

11:28.800 --> 11:35.840
coming then you can jump into the puddle that's teaming, right, so, baths.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.800
Whose idea was this, Drew?

11:37.800 --> 11:39.040
Did you organize this, Drew?

11:39.040 --> 11:46.200
Oh gosh, no, it was Pastor Adam Cain, it was Pastor Adam Cain that did that, and he's

11:46.200 --> 11:47.200
taken over.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.200
Did you call him daddy?

11:49.040 --> 11:55.600
What, no, it's just, it's a fun, it's a fun thing, he's like kind of, um, okay, so contention's

11:55.600 --> 12:01.240
pretty wrecked, right, and so we needed a leader, and Pastor Adam Cain is taking care

12:01.240 --> 12:08.960
of everyone at the First Creek family at contention, and so everyone is there, and that's how we're

12:08.960 --> 12:10.440
staying safe.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.080
Uh, how long have we been gone?

12:13.080 --> 12:16.640
Oh yeah, no, this all popped up in like a day.

12:16.640 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, well I mean, I just want it to be known we didn't abandon you, we were pursuing leads,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
relevant leads.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
We're professionals, Drew, you should know this by now.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.640
Yeah, we were just doing our jobs, I mean, we eliminated a couple huge threats to the

12:32.640 --> 12:40.320
town, Marvin Glass won't be sticking his weird looking face in our business anymore, for

12:40.320 --> 12:46.620
one, cause he's dead, or maybe he's not dead yet in this timeline, but he will be due to

12:46.620 --> 12:48.260
our actions in the past.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.260
You haven't seen us since we left contention, right?

12:51.260 --> 12:52.260
No?

12:52.260 --> 12:53.260
Okay, good.

12:53.260 --> 12:54.260
Wait, what?

12:54.260 --> 12:55.260
Probably.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.260
Don't worry about it.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.940
We'll explain all of this on the way back to contention.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.500
Have you been receiving calls from us?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.380
Have you, has your phone been off or something?

13:02.380 --> 13:09.900
Oh, I, and pulls out a burner, and is like, sorry, I had to get a burner cause I got wet.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.980
I had to jump in a puddle.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.380
You said, you said that you got this puddle teaming thing going on, and you got people

13:15.380 --> 13:18.020
who are jumping into puddles if they see the ooze.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.500
Are you able to see the ooze now?

13:19.500 --> 13:22.220
No, no, we use kids and crazy people.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.340
Kids can see the ooze.

13:23.340 --> 13:28.640
Yeah, maybe that was just a bit too much tell, not show, but yeah, we use kids and crazy

13:28.640 --> 13:30.980
people to do it because they can see the ooze.

13:30.980 --> 13:40.600
No, I think me and my partners are all glad you told us, instead of relying on us to see

13:40.600 --> 13:43.780
those details.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.020
So kids and crazy folks, huh?

13:46.020 --> 13:53.700
Yeah, they can see it for some reason, so basically we use them to scout locations,

13:53.700 --> 13:57.420
but these puddles are everywhere, you know, it's really good.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.020
We also call it bass brimming.

13:59.020 --> 14:02.820
Alright, what do you do with people when their foot gets too pruney?

14:02.820 --> 14:07.500
Oh no, it doesn't take long, you just stay in there for like ten minutes and then the

14:07.500 --> 14:08.980
residue will move away.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.620
It seems like a pretty good system.

14:10.620 --> 14:14.140
I mean, we can't live like this forever, is what I'm trying to say.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.140
We're trying to come up with a solution.

14:15.140 --> 14:17.580
Well, people have been through worse, Drew, you know.

14:17.580 --> 14:18.660
I don't think they have.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.220
Throughout human history.

14:20.220 --> 14:26.420
Then being hunted by an unknown ooze that most of them can't see unless they're crazy?

14:26.420 --> 14:27.420
Yeah.

14:27.420 --> 14:30.500
Oh, okay, the war, you know.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.540
I mean, it just seems like you got the puddles.

14:33.540 --> 14:38.500
I agree that the implementation has been fantastic and the safety, thank you for saying that,

14:38.500 --> 14:43.180
the safety measures taken have been very good, but what we are trying to do now is

14:43.180 --> 14:49.540
get back to a sense of normalcy and we would appreciate having the police officers of contention

14:49.540 --> 14:51.420
help us in that regard.

14:51.420 --> 14:56.820
Well, okay, of course we will come back and help you, but it is way too soon, I think,

14:56.820 --> 15:04.020
to close the puddles.

15:04.020 --> 15:07.460
I walk over to the passenger's side and get in.

15:07.460 --> 15:12.060
Drew, you say you want to return to a sense of normalcy and that you guys have been working

15:12.060 --> 15:13.060
on ideas.

15:13.060 --> 15:17.620
Have you or Pastor Adam Cain come up with any ideas that seem viable so far?

15:17.620 --> 15:19.820
I'm sorry, Daddy Cain is who he means.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.260
Oh, no, you can call him.

15:21.260 --> 15:22.940
You can call him pastor.

15:22.940 --> 15:23.940
It's fine.

15:23.940 --> 15:26.700
You know, it's just, anyway, what was the question?

15:26.700 --> 15:30.460
Do you have any ideas, any thoughts on any theories?

15:30.460 --> 15:36.020
Have you developed any idea about how to maybe vanquish the ooze once and for all?

15:36.020 --> 15:44.260
Okay, so we can collect it with fish.

15:44.260 --> 15:45.260
With fish?

15:45.260 --> 15:46.260
Go on.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.260
Right.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.260
So how'd you figure that one out?

15:48.260 --> 15:49.260
Oh, okay.

15:49.260 --> 15:56.140
So I wasn't there, but apparently a fish can like gather the residue, it like sucks up

15:56.140 --> 16:00.540
into it, basically into its mouth and then you can squeeze it out.

16:00.540 --> 16:01.540
To what end?

16:01.540 --> 16:02.540
Oh, to get rid of it.

16:02.540 --> 16:09.380
I mean, if you needed to put it all somewhere, right, so we're just kind of collecting fish

16:09.380 --> 16:10.380
that have it.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.500
How do you know if the fish have it?

16:12.500 --> 16:16.980
What you're saying is the pastor is collecting all of the ooze in one place?

16:16.980 --> 16:19.700
Oh, yeah, I guess you could say that is what we're doing.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.260
Oh, my God.

16:21.260 --> 16:25.460
Is he putting it into like barrels or how's he collecting it in one place?

16:25.460 --> 16:26.460
I don't know.

16:26.460 --> 16:27.460
I'm not there.

16:27.460 --> 16:28.460
I don't like the sound of that.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.340
Okay, I think we need to go talk to this guy.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.900
We need to get back to contention.

16:32.340 --> 16:35.540
Remind me not to eat Nia's fish fry on Friday.

16:35.540 --> 16:39.340
How quote unquote crazy would a feller have to be to see the ooze?

16:39.340 --> 16:40.340
Oh, um.

16:40.340 --> 16:44.880
If you put a numerical value on your sanity from one to 100, sure, sure.

16:44.880 --> 16:51.460
What threshold might you say someone would start to see the ooze?

16:51.460 --> 16:56.860
I think it's totally a matter of either losing five or more at once or hitting a breaking

16:56.860 --> 16:59.820
point or going to zero.

17:00.820 --> 17:07.300
That's a very concise and to the point and I appreciate how you ran with my metaphor

17:07.300 --> 17:08.300
straight away.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.300
Yeah, you picked that up real quick.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.300
That was good.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.100
I'm just trying to be more forthright here in the end times.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.940
Hey, Drew, did you ever get that cat carrier we sent you off for?

17:15.940 --> 17:16.940
Yeah, of course.

17:16.940 --> 17:17.940
All right, just checking.

17:17.940 --> 17:18.940
I mean.

17:18.940 --> 17:22.340
Hey, have you been spending your money?

17:22.340 --> 17:24.340
Yeah, no.

17:24.340 --> 17:25.340
No.

17:25.340 --> 17:27.580
Yeah, that sounds rad.

17:28.340 --> 17:29.340
Hey, the feller we sold it to.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.340
He's dead.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.340
Wait, what?

17:31.340 --> 17:32.340
Yeah.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.340
The Duke is dead?

17:33.340 --> 17:34.340
It was Keith's brother.

17:34.340 --> 17:35.340
The Duke was Ferguson Beans?

17:35.340 --> 17:36.340
Yeah.

17:36.340 --> 17:37.340
And Keith killed him.

17:37.340 --> 17:40.020
Why don't we talk about it on the way back?

17:40.020 --> 17:41.020
Okay.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.020
Montage.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.020
Road trip montage to contention.

17:44.020 --> 17:49.020
Road trip montage to contention.

17:49.020 --> 17:56.620
Drew looks at you guys and is like, so you guys had the gun and the camera and the Nike

17:56.660 --> 17:57.660
bag.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.020
Do you guys have all those with you?

18:01.020 --> 18:04.620
The gun and the camera are back at Marvin's, but don't worry.

18:04.620 --> 18:08.380
We've got a plan that eventually our past selves are going to pop out of the ground

18:08.380 --> 18:09.740
and then we're going to go and get them.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.740
So don't worry about that.

18:10.740 --> 18:11.740
Thank you.

18:11.740 --> 18:12.740
Say that again.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.420
How much time do you reckon we have to get back to contention?

18:14.420 --> 18:20.660
Like could we maybe go run and see a movie and wait until the wee morning hours to leave

18:20.660 --> 18:21.660
the city?

18:21.660 --> 18:25.620
Because if we do, then we could bring the gun and the camera back.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.020
Does he have the bag too?

18:27.020 --> 18:28.020
Yeah.

18:28.020 --> 18:29.900
Marvin's got that bag too, huh?

18:29.900 --> 18:30.900
So yeah.

18:30.900 --> 18:36.740
I mean, if you think people could, uh, you know, puddle it out for another 12 to 18 hours

18:36.740 --> 18:42.060
say, and until we can just stroll on into that glass compound, which will pretty soon

18:42.060 --> 18:43.500
be, be ruined.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.100
How is it going to be ruined?

18:45.100 --> 18:51.400
Well, uh, a pretty funny sequence of events, honestly, we could probably just go get some

18:51.400 --> 18:59.960
seats and watch it happen again, if you think we can, we can spare the time.

18:59.960 --> 19:05.040
I mean, do you need us back in contention by this evening or can we, can we wait until,

19:05.040 --> 19:09.820
you know, maybe we get the gun and the camera and then hit up a diner and get a nice like

19:09.820 --> 19:13.120
breakfast and then head back to contention tomorrow morning.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.360
There is something in contention.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.520
I think that would be important for us to check out.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.520
What's that?

19:18.520 --> 19:19.520
What's that?

19:19.520 --> 19:24.900
I'll just show you then to explain, but we need to go back to my, my hotel first and

19:24.900 --> 19:26.360
it'll make a lot more sense.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.120
Are you talking about checking on your, on your dog?

19:29.120 --> 19:30.440
Oh shit.

19:30.440 --> 19:37.880
Yeah, I guess I do need to do that too.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.240
That's my question to Drew.

19:39.240 --> 19:44.120
Drew, do you think we need the gun and the camera and the Nike bag before we head back

19:44.120 --> 19:45.120
to contention?

19:45.120 --> 19:46.120
Okay.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.120
Here's what I'm going to say.

19:47.120 --> 19:53.160
I think that having the gun and the camera and the Nike bag would be a huge plus.

19:53.160 --> 20:00.840
However, the most important thing is that you guys come back with me to contention.

20:00.840 --> 20:07.640
I will say though, if we do wait, contention will be a different place when we get there.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
I'm sure of it.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.640
What do you mean by that?

20:10.640 --> 20:11.640
That doesn't sound good.

20:11.640 --> 20:16.740
No, I just mean like I have a feeling the situation happening in contention currently

20:16.740 --> 20:22.700
will have changed, maybe even escalated if we were to not handle it currently.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.700
Sure.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.700
Sure.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.700
If we were to go do something else.

20:25.700 --> 20:29.740
It's entirely up to you guys because there's three of you and there's only one of me.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.940
And this whole fish thing collecting the ooze.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.480
Oh right, yeah.

20:34.480 --> 20:38.140
The pastor rubbed me wrong the first time I met him anyway, so.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.660
The pastor did what to you?

20:39.660 --> 20:42.340
He was not very welcoming to me.

20:42.340 --> 20:45.260
I find that deeply hard to understand.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.660
What a wise man.

20:46.660 --> 20:50.100
You know, Keith kind of, Keith that up to be honest.

20:50.100 --> 20:53.460
Have you always had this admiration for pastor Adam Cain or is that a risk to them?

20:53.460 --> 20:57.060
It's just that when someone steps up in the face of crisis, you have to give thanks where

20:57.060 --> 20:58.060
thanks is due.

20:58.060 --> 21:03.100
Drew, you haven't, you haven't tithed to this fella, have you?

21:03.100 --> 21:05.100
Roll human.

21:05.100 --> 21:10.060
Ooh, 55, what do I have?

21:10.060 --> 21:14.660
Fuck, I've got a 50, so critical fail.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.460
Dang!

21:16.460 --> 21:17.580
Don't leap anymore.

21:17.580 --> 21:22.340
No matter which body you're in, I think that you of all people would understand that what

21:22.340 --> 21:26.380
is Drew Andrews' money is Drew Andrews' money.

21:26.380 --> 21:29.700
Alright, just don't get taken for a fool.

21:29.700 --> 21:34.700
No one could ever call me a fool.

21:34.700 --> 21:39.900
Wow, that sounded really ominous.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.060
And forceful for you, Drew.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.460
Drew, have you ever branded somebody a fool?

21:43.460 --> 21:45.140
I've been gone for one day, maybe.

21:45.140 --> 21:48.320
You've been gone for one day and like, I know we said the whole thing, but you think

21:48.320 --> 21:51.980
I started branding people with my newfound fame and fortune?

21:51.980 --> 21:53.520
Not fame, but fortune?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.620
I'd like to human this.

21:55.620 --> 21:56.620
No.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.620
No, okay, good.

21:58.620 --> 22:04.300
I, for one, am going to throw the hat in the ring that I don't know what the gun and the

22:04.300 --> 22:05.300
camera help us much down there.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.300
Yeah, we don't really know how to use them.

22:06.300 --> 22:07.580
I think we should get down there, do what we can first.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.880
Do we have one name left on us or two?

22:09.880 --> 22:10.880
We got two.

22:10.880 --> 22:11.880
We got Tildy.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.420
Okay, so this isn't-

22:13.420 --> 22:15.260
And uh, Drew?

22:15.260 --> 22:16.460
We don't need to bring everything.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.460
Wait, hold on.

22:17.460 --> 22:18.460
You guys have my name on you?

22:18.460 --> 22:20.060
Two contention to wrap it all up.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.780
No, no, no, it's uh-

22:21.780 --> 22:22.780
You're on our mind.

22:22.780 --> 22:27.540
Keith was just about to say, Drew, you're uh, it's so great that you came and got-

22:27.540 --> 22:33.040
Yeah, I was gonna say we got Tildy written on us and Drew, this is another thing we'll

22:33.040 --> 22:36.060
have to explain on the way, but we got names written on us.

22:36.060 --> 22:39.060
Wait, okay, you got my name written on you and-

22:39.060 --> 22:40.380
No, no, no, no, no.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.380
Oh, you got Tildy?

22:41.780 --> 22:42.780
I mean, Keith, you just-

22:42.780 --> 22:44.780
Even though that is what it sounded like Keith was saying again, you just said it.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.620
He just said the word almost exactly, word for word.

22:46.620 --> 22:47.620
I mean, it sounded like-

22:47.620 --> 22:48.620
I, I interrupted myself.

22:48.620 --> 22:51.140
Do you even know what you're talking about, Keith Vigno?

22:51.140 --> 22:58.300
When you speak, do you ever know what's coming out of your mouth?

22:58.300 --> 22:59.300
Bubble gum tree.

22:59.300 --> 23:02.020
Now, Drew, you don't get to talk to him like that.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.020
Bubble gum tree.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.020
Oh yeah.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.020
Okay.

23:05.020 --> 23:07.400
He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.620
He could just be repeating what we said, bubble gum tree.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.020
Oh God.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.020
Oh shit.

23:13.020 --> 23:16.540
But yeah, I do wonder, is this the real Drew Andrews?

23:16.540 --> 23:18.920
Tell us something Drew Andrews would know.

23:18.920 --> 23:25.660
I sold a pallet of cocaine with John Lee Pettymore IV for $10 million to the Duke.

23:25.660 --> 23:26.660
No, everybody knows that.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.940
Wow, Drew, you just said that out loud with other officers in the car.

23:28.940 --> 23:29.940
This was a sting, Drew.

23:29.940 --> 23:35.420
Drew looks around to see if there's anybody besides you guys in the car.

23:35.420 --> 23:36.540
I thought they knew.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.700
I'm just messing with you, Drew.

23:38.700 --> 23:39.700
I know about it.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.060
I'm disappointed in it, but.

23:41.060 --> 23:43.060
What's your cousin's name?

23:43.060 --> 23:44.060
Emmett.

23:44.060 --> 23:46.060
He's the EMT.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.580
Yeah, Emmett the EMT.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.580
Okay.

23:49.580 --> 23:53.740
If you're still wondering who I am, Keith Vigna, thank you very much.

23:53.740 --> 24:01.500
I went and picked up a cat carrier to go take a cat that had the soul of an FBI agent inside

24:01.500 --> 24:02.740
of it.

24:02.740 --> 24:05.300
So maybe don't question me.

24:05.300 --> 24:06.300
Okay.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.300
Okay.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.060
We just got to be careful, you know.

24:09.460 --> 24:13.620
Well, if he is fake, he's a very good facsimile, so.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.780
I get behind him and start peeling his face off.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.220
No, I don't do that.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.740
It would be really hard.

24:21.740 --> 24:26.060
Drew, can you take us to my hotel?

24:26.060 --> 24:27.660
Yeah, real quick.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.700
Who has the best humant?

24:29.700 --> 24:30.700
I have 80.

24:30.700 --> 24:37.060
Oh, go ahead and roll that 80.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.060
Check that out.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.220
I can't see what that says.

24:41.220 --> 24:43.220
It's a 79 on an 80.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.220
Oh, nice.

24:44.220 --> 24:46.900
Keith Vigna, you know that something is up.

24:46.900 --> 24:49.900
Drew is acting strange, obviously.

24:49.900 --> 24:55.180
That's why you questioned him on it, but he definitely skipped out on the question of

24:55.180 --> 24:58.380
how he knew where you were.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.380
Yeah.

24:59.380 --> 25:07.740
John Lee Pettymore's eyes roll back in his head and he feels 10 points lucky.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.740
Unluckier-less.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.740
Unluckier?

25:09.740 --> 25:10.740
Luckless.

25:10.740 --> 25:11.740
Can we watch this?

25:11.740 --> 25:12.740
No, I'm gonna kick you out.

25:12.740 --> 25:13.740
Hey, Thomas.

25:13.740 --> 25:14.740
Hey, Zach.

25:14.740 --> 25:29.460
What are you looking for in the deep depths of John Lee Pettymore's mind?

25:29.460 --> 25:35.740
John Lee Pettymore is going to use his clairvoyance talent by spending 10 luck, and he wants to

25:35.740 --> 25:39.500
know if this Drew can be trusted.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.780
Like even if it is the real Drew, can we still trust Drew?

25:42.780 --> 25:45.500
John Lee Pettymore as your...

25:45.500 --> 25:46.500
Sorry.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.500
John Lee Kevinmore.

25:47.500 --> 25:54.260
What I have on my character sheet is Kevin John Pettymore the third.

25:54.260 --> 25:56.060
I love it.

25:56.060 --> 25:57.060
Kevin John Pettymore the third.

25:57.060 --> 25:59.920
But I think John Lee Pettymore the third works too.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.580
John Lee Pettymore the third.

26:01.580 --> 26:09.700
Your eyes roll into the back of your head and you see a reflection, it's your daddy.

26:09.700 --> 26:15.740
Well it's the body you're in currently, but it's back when he was still your daddy.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.960
You recognize the face from pictures.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.700
The reflection is poor, clouded and gray.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.580
It's a television screen.

26:23.580 --> 26:31.260
Then the television turns on, and you see the empty interior of the contention police

26:31.260 --> 26:32.260
station.

26:32.260 --> 26:33.260
And it's a mess.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.260
It's a wreck.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.460
There's water that's been splashed all over the place.

26:36.460 --> 26:42.620
There's files just like riddling over the floor, over everything.

26:42.620 --> 26:46.500
It's where it's in the state that you last saw it.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.480
And the channel changes.

26:48.480 --> 26:54.840
You see Jim Cook in an abandoned gas station briefing three familiar faces you recognize

26:54.840 --> 27:02.480
from a file in Marvin Glass's compound as a team called K-Cell, comprised of this young

27:02.480 --> 27:10.100
John Lee Pettymore the third, aka Kevin, a man called Kyle, and Karen, which is the alias

27:10.100 --> 27:12.300
of Anne Love.

27:12.300 --> 27:18.460
As the three are leaving this derelict come and go, you see Jim Cook calls Karen back

27:18.460 --> 27:21.260
real quick to have a word in private.

27:21.260 --> 27:24.060
The channel changes.

27:24.060 --> 27:30.820
Back in the disheveled contention police station, Drew Andrews leans on a two-tiered plastic

27:30.820 --> 27:34.520
cart as he pushes it towards the evidence room.

27:34.520 --> 27:41.180
He punches in the code, enters with an empty cart, and rolls on out with the radio on top

27:41.260 --> 27:43.820
and the helmet on bottom.

27:43.820 --> 27:50.780
And that helmet is sitting on the briefcase that you know contains Drew's cut.

27:50.780 --> 27:53.900
Five million dollars.

27:53.900 --> 27:59.860
The channel changes, and you see Drew pushing this full cart up through the sanctuary of

27:59.860 --> 28:08.020
the First Church of Contention, which is hard to recognize with all of its pews removed.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.860
And the TV turns off, click.

28:10.860 --> 28:18.020
But then, the glass of the television screen slowly rolls down like a car window as Karen

28:18.020 --> 28:20.140
screams.

28:20.140 --> 28:25.140
She's holding these two people at gunpoint in their own hallway just to the right of

28:25.140 --> 28:29.660
you, and they refuse to tell her what she wants to know.

28:29.660 --> 28:31.460
Where is it?

28:31.460 --> 28:34.620
She screams behind the screen.

28:34.620 --> 28:40.260
Inside this television, you see there's a book.

28:40.260 --> 28:47.060
It seems to be made of a strange, uncured leather that's got like, maybe some hair on

28:47.060 --> 28:48.060
it?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.060
A few freckles?

28:49.060 --> 28:51.300
It's the human book.

28:51.300 --> 28:58.100
You blink, and you're staring at your reflection again in this completely normal television

28:58.100 --> 28:59.300
screen.

28:59.300 --> 29:06.220
You stand up and turn to Karen, who is now maniacally laughing as she shoves her pistol

29:06.220 --> 29:11.160
into the man's mouth while forcing the woman to watch.

29:11.160 --> 29:18.760
You feel a decision inside yourself being made.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.760
It's not here.

29:19.760 --> 29:25.940
I mean, he talks like that now, but it probably sounded normal back then.

29:25.940 --> 29:26.940
It's not here.

29:26.940 --> 29:32.140
Hey, we got it.

29:32.140 --> 29:39.580
Karen's eyes light up as she begins chanting in some tongue, either ancient or alien, and

29:39.580 --> 29:47.640
this couple begins rising slowly, steadily off the carpet.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.220
Do I recognize the couple?

29:49.220 --> 29:50.220
Yeah, you've seen-

29:50.220 --> 29:51.480
Is it Clark's parents?

29:51.480 --> 29:52.480
It's Clark's parents.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.140
It's Eunice and Jerry Bishop, Clark's parents.

29:55.140 --> 30:00.740
You've seen their picture every day for a while sitting on Clark Bishop's desk.

30:00.740 --> 30:07.140
Your vision shifts completely to a close-up of a man's left hand.

30:07.140 --> 30:14.060
Blood is flowing down from his forearm and dripping from his fingers, and you see Drew

30:14.060 --> 30:27.000
Andrews lean into frame and kiss the ring on this man's hands, bloody fourth digit.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.680
What I'm getting from my question, can we trust Drew, is no.

30:31.680 --> 30:36.120
Yeah, I think that's going to be a no dog.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.120
Okay.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.680
Did Keith say he was in the front seat or the back seat?

30:39.680 --> 30:40.680
Front seat.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.680
I'm going to say I am directly behind him.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.680
Okay.

30:44.680 --> 30:45.680
Do you want me to bring the other two back?

30:45.680 --> 30:53.840
Right rear passenger seat, yes.

30:53.840 --> 31:01.660
All right, John Lee Pettymore III is 10 luck lighter as his eyes immediately come fluttering

31:01.660 --> 31:10.360
back into reality, and he looks to his left and sees Clark Bishop in the back seat right

31:10.360 --> 31:11.360
next to him.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.360
Are we driving right now?

31:12.360 --> 31:17.040
As you're driving, yeah, on the highway towards contention, and Keith Vigna is up sitting

31:17.040 --> 31:23.320
shotgun with Drew Andrews driving this red 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.800
I've seen it before, and it led to good things, so I just let it happen.

31:27.800 --> 31:32.520
I might, you know what I'll do, I'll like tap Keith on the shoulder and just kind of

31:32.520 --> 31:33.520
point.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.520
He's doing the thing.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
Remember?

31:35.520 --> 31:36.520
He was able to like see things last time.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.520
And then he's back.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.520
I don't know what the-

31:38.520 --> 31:42.960
Uh, hey Drew, can you pull off at the next exit?

31:42.960 --> 31:45.320
I'm so sorry, but I really have to pee.

31:45.320 --> 31:51.640
This old body, the bladder isn't, you know, not as strong as I'm used to.

31:51.640 --> 31:58.040
I'm still adjusting to the new Corpus, so, uh, could we, could we pl- I just, I'm about,

31:58.040 --> 32:03.700
I'm about to piss all over your car if we don't, you know, pull over right, right, right

32:03.700 --> 32:05.640
now at this next exit at this gas station.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.200
That really freaks Keith out.

32:07.200 --> 32:11.840
Hey, Jon, I understand that maybe when you're in an older body, you know, some bodily functions

32:11.840 --> 32:16.440
don't work the same way that we used to, and, you know, you're not as trained in knowing

32:16.440 --> 32:21.840
when your body needs to go, but I ain't gonna need you to maybe just like hold it because

32:21.840 --> 32:25.960
as you well know, there aren't any gas stations in between the city and contention, it's only

32:25.960 --> 32:26.960
an hour drive.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.840
Uh, uh, okay, well, um, I lied.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.160
I don't need to pee.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.760
I'm about to shit my pants.

32:35.760 --> 32:40.120
I'm gonna shit, and this car is gonna smell like shit the whole ride.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.120
Please pull over, Drew.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
Oh, Drew, please pull over, we don't want that.

32:42.120 --> 32:46.080
These guys have some bad memories about an old man shittin' all over the place, it'll

32:46.080 --> 32:48.700
probably make them barf all over the car.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.080
It's just because of the memories, though.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.400
Even if we just find a field or something.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.920
Oh, no!

32:54.920 --> 33:01.800
Exactly, yeah, so, uh, yeah, I mean, I like just pull over on the side of the road and

33:01.800 --> 33:04.560
I will go shit in that long grass, I swear to God.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.520
Yeah, no, of course, for sure.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.760
Uh, yeah, I'll drive you.

33:09.760 --> 33:14.840
He sees this like little country road that's going off, little gravel road.

33:14.880 --> 33:20.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll take this, turns off, and drives down it just a little bit, and

33:20.320 --> 33:22.840
then is like, hey, do you think here is fine?

33:22.840 --> 33:26.960
Yeah, yeah, oh my God, just pull over, just pull over to the side of the road.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.880
You're next to a cornfield, but it's December.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.040
Perfect, perfect.

33:32.040 --> 33:35.880
So it's just flat land that you can clearly see through.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.040
I'll just, I'll just, I'll just duck down low.

33:38.040 --> 33:42.480
As we're pulling in, I'm nervous and I have my hand on my gun, but not like out.

33:42.480 --> 33:48.120
I think Clark is oblivious, he's thinking, oh shit, John's got a shit.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.760
To that end, uh, John steps hard on your toe.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.360
Oops, John, you got me on my foot there.

33:53.360 --> 33:57.560
John gives, gives Clark, like he, he stares daggers at him.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.320
Okay, so the car has stopped.

33:59.320 --> 34:03.200
The car, as soon as the car stops, John pulls his gun on Drew.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.040
As soon as I see that, I pull my gun on Drew too.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.680
All of our eyes just got so big.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.000
Clark doesn't pull his gun right away and is startled.

34:09.040 --> 34:13.080
John says to Drew, put it in park or I'll blow your brains out.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.720
Oh, John, John, John, fellas.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.600
Put it in fucking park, Drew.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.600
Drew puts the car in park.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.920
Take the keys out and hand them to Keith.

34:23.640 --> 34:26.500
Drew takes the keys out and hands them to Keith.

34:27.520 --> 34:32.280
All right, now slowly exit the vehicle.

34:32.280 --> 34:36.240
Clark, Clark, you get out too and you keep them covered.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.600
As soon as he's out, I want you to put them in handcuffs.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.520
This ain't our Drew.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.080
Oh, it ain't our Drew.

34:43.080 --> 34:43.920
Money changed.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.440
Clark has gone ahead and starting to get out.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.840
I answered all your questions.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.200
I answered all your questions.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.280
I don't know why you don't think I'm me.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.160
It happened all the sudden.

34:52.160 --> 34:54.960
John, I mean, you're not even John, what's going on?

34:54.960 --> 34:55.800
Hold on just a second.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.400
Murphy keeps barking at the door.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.120
What the hell did that mean?

35:04.260 --> 35:05.680
I think he's got a shit real bad.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.500
Murphy's barking at the door.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.340
He's barking at the door.

35:07.340 --> 35:08.340
That's what it means.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.020
I know you already said you have to go poop.

35:19.820 --> 35:24.820
Drew Andrews slowly opens the driver's side of this car.

35:25.580 --> 35:26.980
Get on him, Clark, cover him.

35:26.980 --> 35:27.820
I'm doing it.

35:27.820 --> 35:29.940
And hands in the air.

35:29.940 --> 35:32.760
Okay, guys, I don't know what's going on here,

35:32.760 --> 35:34.020
but I would really thank you

35:34.020 --> 35:36.020
to not do whatever you're about to do.

35:36.020 --> 35:36.860
Drew.

35:37.380 --> 35:38.220
Drew.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.060
Drew, stop talking.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.300
Stop talking right now, Drew.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.260
I'm putting his hands behind his back

35:45.260 --> 35:49.060
and I'm saying, Drew, I'm sorry, but I got to trust

35:49.060 --> 35:51.660
my partner here and I'm cuffing him.

35:51.660 --> 35:54.860
Okay, yeah, I mean, Drew's not gonna resist.

35:54.860 --> 35:55.700
Drew.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.700
Wait, hey, I turn back to you.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.720
All right, John, what's going on here?

35:59.720 --> 36:01.680
I don't like having Drew in handcuffs.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.520
This isn't right.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.040
I know, he knows it too.

36:05.040 --> 36:08.320
Ever since I came back into this body,

36:08.320 --> 36:11.960
I've had the ability to peer beyond the veil.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.720
Now it takes something from me,

36:13.720 --> 36:18.080
but I can see moments from this sphere

36:18.080 --> 36:19.880
in which I did not participate.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.260
Like the future or?

36:21.260 --> 36:22.660
And the past.

36:22.660 --> 36:24.760
This time it was just the past

36:24.760 --> 36:29.480
and what I saw in the past was that Drew took the radio,

36:29.480 --> 36:32.880
the helmet, and all his money from the evidence locker

36:33.840 --> 36:35.780
and gave it to the church.

36:35.780 --> 36:40.120
And then he kissed some creepy bloody hand with a ring,

36:40.120 --> 36:42.220
a wedding band on its finger.

36:42.220 --> 36:44.240
So Drew, my question to you

36:44.240 --> 36:47.080
is why did you take those items to the church?

36:47.080 --> 36:48.880
I mean, it's simple really.

36:48.880 --> 36:53.880
When someone is quick to take control of a situation,

36:54.720 --> 36:56.000
then they have all the power

36:56.000 --> 36:59.480
and people who have all the power have the ability

36:59.480 --> 37:02.760
to make other people do things that they may not wanna do

37:03.600 --> 37:04.500
and I was one of those people

37:04.500 --> 37:07.560
who was made to do something that I didn't wanna do.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.000
They said that I could be saved.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.360
I could have my life, I could be safe

37:14.360 --> 37:16.280
if I brought these things

37:16.280 --> 37:21.280
and so it was my only option.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.000
Oh, Drew.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.200
Drew, you didn't think to ask us or call us?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.040
Roll a human.

37:27.040 --> 37:27.880
Me?

37:27.880 --> 37:28.700
Yeah.

37:28.700 --> 37:29.860
38 on an 80. You all can.

37:30.860 --> 37:32.340
Three.

37:33.620 --> 37:36.980
Ooh, a seven. I pass with my little dinky score.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.700
Joe and I just human-ed the shit out of Drew.

37:39.700 --> 37:40.580
I lost my dice.

37:40.580 --> 37:41.660
Those are pretty important

37:41.660 --> 37:43.940
for what we're doing here today, Zach.

37:43.940 --> 37:44.820
That's a crit fail.

37:44.820 --> 37:46.140
Make some numbers up.

37:46.140 --> 37:48.100
Yeah, if you just wanna say numbers, that's fine.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.460
That's what we've been doing.

37:49.460 --> 37:54.460
When I dropped my dice earlier, I couldn't find it, so.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.780
I accidentally threw away my character sheet.

37:56.780 --> 37:57.660
I've just been winging it.

37:57.660 --> 37:59.220
That's a pass.

38:00.340 --> 38:01.740
Okay, what did everyone roll?

38:01.740 --> 38:02.900
38 on an 80.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.500
Three on a 50.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.340
Seven on a 30.

38:06.340 --> 38:08.060
Yeah, it seems like he was stuck

38:08.060 --> 38:09.900
between a rock and a hard place

38:09.900 --> 38:11.900
and had to make a decision

38:11.900 --> 38:14.800
and this is the call that he made.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.060
How'd the pastor know about the money?

38:17.060 --> 38:20.780
Well, he kinda tortured me.

38:20.780 --> 38:21.620
What?

38:21.620 --> 38:22.680
Drew.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.260
When he says that, I kinda look him over.

38:24.260 --> 38:27.220
Is there any visible torture on his body?

38:27.220 --> 38:29.940
Drew lifts up his shirt.

38:29.940 --> 38:34.940
There is a ring of blistered skin on his stomach,

38:35.780 --> 38:37.420
on his round belly.

38:37.420 --> 38:38.660
Oh, God, Drew.

38:38.660 --> 38:42.740
There are scratch marks, cuts, and bite marks

38:42.740 --> 38:46.220
all over the inside of this circle.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.620
The pastor did this to you?

38:48.780 --> 38:49.620
Well.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.500
You do that thing where you heat up a container of rats

38:52.500 --> 38:55.620
and they try to escape by clawing through your belly.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.380
And Drew just pukes.

38:57.380 --> 39:00.620
Something crosses his mind and he just like retches

39:00.620 --> 39:03.620
and is like, ugh, ugh, ugh.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.500
Vomit splashes on his feet.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.220
John, can I get him out of these cuffs?

39:07.220 --> 39:09.820
This is just sad.

39:09.820 --> 39:12.180
I don't know if we should take him out of the cuffs.

39:12.180 --> 39:15.020
I mean, I think we can keep him with us

39:15.020 --> 39:16.500
and not fear for our safety,

39:16.500 --> 39:18.220
but maybe we should keep him detained

39:18.220 --> 39:20.860
until we know the full extent of the hold

39:20.860 --> 39:22.460
this pastor has over him.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.680
If we haven't patted him down,

39:23.680 --> 39:24.980
it might be a good time to make sure

39:25.020 --> 39:26.100
he doesn't have any kind of-

39:26.100 --> 39:27.680
I get out of the passenger seat,

39:27.680 --> 39:30.400
I go over and I hug Drew,

39:30.400 --> 39:33.600
but then I pat him down after I give him a hug.

39:33.600 --> 39:38.600
There is a small piece of cheap carpet in his pocket.

39:40.060 --> 39:43.900
It is a little damp

39:43.900 --> 39:48.900
and it's been rubbed on something that is like red

39:49.540 --> 39:52.580
or like dark red.

39:52.580 --> 39:55.460
Basically looks like a tiny piece of cheap carpet

39:55.460 --> 39:57.820
that's been dipped in blood.

39:57.820 --> 39:58.660
Drew-

39:58.660 --> 39:59.500
But maybe not dipped,

39:59.500 --> 40:00.460
but just like a little bit rubbed on it.

40:00.460 --> 40:03.460
Drew, what is this?

40:03.460 --> 40:04.780
It's nothing.

40:04.780 --> 40:05.980
Drew, come on.

40:05.980 --> 40:07.020
It's obviously something.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.260
It's something that was in your pocket, it looks like.

40:09.260 --> 40:11.520
It's a real strange item you got there.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.820
No, it's just, I found it in the car.

40:13.820 --> 40:14.780
In this car?

40:14.780 --> 40:15.940
Drew.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.140
Everybody roll human.

40:18.140 --> 40:19.820
Everybody roll human.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.260
72 on a 80.

40:21.260 --> 40:22.500
43 on a 50.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.020
He didn't find it in the car.

40:25.020 --> 40:27.080
Drew, we know he didn't find this in no car.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.660
Just tell us what it is.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.300
You know we're just trying to help.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.500
We're the good guys.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.620
I don't, I-

40:32.620 --> 40:33.860
Are you still a good guy, Drew?

40:33.860 --> 40:34.940
I don't know if you are.

40:34.940 --> 40:37.980
Do you remember what happened to the town of contention

40:37.980 --> 40:39.740
while it was under your watch?

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
It was under your watch too, Drew.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.660
Everyone.

40:42.660 --> 40:46.300
People lost their animals, people lost their families.

40:46.300 --> 40:47.700
Drew, you know as well as us

40:47.700 --> 40:49.540
that we did everything we could.

40:49.540 --> 40:51.580
We were working the case the whole time.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.560
It's not like we abandoned anybody.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.060
Didn't talk to anyone about anything.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.760
Didn't let the public know what was going on.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.580
Didn't respond to any calls.

41:00.580 --> 41:02.860
Drew, we responded to every call we could.

41:02.860 --> 41:06.020
Now you well know, working for the department yourself,

41:06.020 --> 41:07.500
that we were ill-equipped

41:07.500 --> 41:09.460
and had none of the resources we needed

41:09.460 --> 41:13.260
to face a full-on reality-shattering catastrophe.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.640
John, are you ill-equipped for everything

41:15.640 --> 41:18.060
that you've ever come across in your life?

41:18.060 --> 41:20.360
Drew, does this little carpet sample,

41:20.360 --> 41:22.360
is this some kind of magic talisman

41:22.360 --> 41:24.520
that the preacher's using to control you?

41:24.520 --> 41:25.360
Yes.

41:27.440 --> 41:30.960
Wow, that was a hell of a swing and a hit there, John.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.800
Good work on that.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.520
I'm fucking kidding.

41:33.520 --> 41:35.760
It's not what it is, thank you very much.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.480
You can just say something and then it's true.

41:38.480 --> 41:42.760
Drew, you've never been sarcastic a day in your life.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.280
Something's wrong with you.

41:44.280 --> 41:45.880
Something in you is not you.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.040
What's going on here?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.560
I just don't understand why you guys don't believe me.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.120
We believe that you were tortured and gave up the gun.

41:53.120 --> 41:53.960
Okay.

41:53.960 --> 41:56.080
We just, or not the gun, you know, the Adams.

41:56.080 --> 41:56.920
Yeah.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.260
Obviously that affected you.

41:59.260 --> 42:01.360
Sorry about the whole rat thing.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.240
Yeah.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.320
Rat, yeah, that's rough.

42:04.320 --> 42:05.720
So what have I done wrong?

42:05.720 --> 42:07.840
Tell us what this is, where it came from.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.440
We need you, yeah.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.240
We need you to tell us what this is.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.220
Okay, I'll show you.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.560
Hand me the, just put it in my mouth.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.200
And Drew opens up his mouth.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.520
I look at the other officers.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.680
What do you think, fellas?

42:28.680 --> 42:29.520
I mean, he's cuffed still.

42:29.520 --> 42:32.520
You're the one who's been real suspicious here.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.280
Do you think it could be something

42:34.280 --> 42:35.960
you could use against us in some way?

42:35.960 --> 42:38.020
What are you gonna do if I do that?

42:38.020 --> 42:41.840
You asked earlier, if telling you about this

42:41.840 --> 42:44.120
will make us like be cool,

42:44.120 --> 42:45.880
cause I don't know why you put me in handcuffs

42:45.880 --> 42:48.080
all of a sudden, like I haven't done anything wrong.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.360
So if this'll make us cool,

42:49.360 --> 42:50.960
then I'll just tell you the truth about this.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.480
I didn't wanna blow your minds or anything,

42:52.480 --> 42:54.120
but just like you asked earlier

42:54.120 --> 42:56.560
about how I knew where you were

42:56.560 --> 42:57.900
and this is how I knew where you were.

42:57.900 --> 43:01.480
So tell me like who you wanna know where they are

43:01.480 --> 43:02.840
and like what they're doing or something

43:02.840 --> 43:04.000
and put that in my mouth.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.080
Okay, yeah, why don't you just tell us

43:06.080 --> 43:08.200
the nature of this item?

43:08.200 --> 43:10.600
I believe you, you don't have to demonstrate.

43:10.600 --> 43:11.440
Why don't you tell us exactly.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.640
If you believe me, then take me out of these handcuffs.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.880
Thank you very much.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.020
No, no, no, you gotta tell us what exactly it does

43:18.820 --> 43:19.660
and how you came across it.

43:19.660 --> 43:20.700
I put it in my throat and it chokes me out

43:20.700 --> 43:23.260
until I almost die and I go unconscious a little bit

43:23.260 --> 43:26.240
and I see where whoever I'm thinking about is.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.900
Drew, I'm almost certain someone is playing a prank on you.

43:34.900 --> 43:38.220
Keith gets excited, puts the carpet in his mouth

43:38.220 --> 43:39.360
and says Tildy.

43:43.220 --> 43:44.060
Holy shit.

43:44.060 --> 43:45.120
You gotta shove it in there,

43:45.120 --> 43:47.260
like making a dog take a pill.

43:47.260 --> 43:50.780
Okay, describe it in detail.

43:50.780 --> 43:53.280
This seems like something that someone should draw.

43:55.180 --> 43:58.880
Mid-sentence, he just grabs Drew's mouth,

43:58.880 --> 44:03.180
opens his mouth up, shoves the carpet in there,

44:03.180 --> 44:05.380
closes his mouth and says Tildy B.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.900
Drew?

44:13.900 --> 44:15.340
Drew, you there?

44:15.340 --> 44:16.540
Oh, I almost threw up.

44:18.260 --> 44:21.120
Hold on, Clark, you gotta let him nearly die.

44:23.700 --> 44:26.320
I'm looking at his eyes, though, is he conscious?

44:26.320 --> 44:28.060
Is he aware of his surroundings and all that

44:28.060 --> 44:29.500
as he's choking?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.940
Yeah, he's just choking.

44:30.940 --> 44:33.260
He's gotta pass out for the magic to happen.

44:33.260 --> 44:37.460
He slowly gets on his hands and, well, no, he's handcuffed.

44:37.460 --> 44:39.260
Is he handcuffed behind the back or in front?

44:39.260 --> 44:40.380
I said behind earlier, yeah.

44:40.380 --> 44:43.780
So he gets down on his knees and-

44:43.780 --> 44:44.940
I'm kinda helping him down.

44:44.940 --> 44:47.300
Okay, yeah, and then help him onto his side.

44:47.300 --> 44:48.580
That's what he's trying to do.

44:48.580 --> 44:49.420
That's what I do.

44:49.420 --> 44:51.140
And he's just choking, choking, choking,

44:51.140 --> 44:54.940
and then he's completely still.

44:55.820 --> 45:00.180
And then this small, little violently red burst

45:00.180 --> 45:01.420
shoots out of his mouth,

45:01.420 --> 45:04.680
and the carpet only comes halfway out.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.560
It's mostly just blood he spits out.

45:06.560 --> 45:08.500
Carpet's hanging out of his mouth,

45:08.500 --> 45:11.120
and he starts chewing on it a little bit.

45:12.080 --> 45:16.960
Oh, God, oh, yeah, that is not wonderful.

45:16.960 --> 45:20.720
If you could unhandcuff me, please, now that we're friends.

45:22.200 --> 45:26.520
Tilly B. Mitchell is in a dark container.

45:26.520 --> 45:31.080
It seems to be four walls made of some sort of material

45:31.080 --> 45:34.120
that she cannot get out of,

45:34.120 --> 45:37.040
and I couldn't really make out everything

45:37.040 --> 45:39.000
that was her whole deal,

45:39.040 --> 45:43.120
but she didn't seem to be tan.

45:43.120 --> 45:44.800
It was very, very pale.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.880
Cool, anybody else you guys wanna know?

45:50.760 --> 45:55.760
No, no, please, please.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.080
What's Jay Leno doing right now?

45:58.080 --> 46:01.580
I just can't, I can't, did you see what-

46:01.580 --> 46:02.920
Shove it in there, shove it in there.

46:02.920 --> 46:04.840
Let's see what old Jay's up to.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.280
I bet he's driving a car.

46:06.280 --> 46:11.060
I need a sanity roll from Clark Bishop

46:11.060 --> 46:13.640
and John Lee, Pettymore the Third.

46:13.640 --> 46:15.280
I mean, you think we give a shit

46:15.280 --> 46:17.560
about his little vision carpet?

46:17.560 --> 46:19.000
I hope so, you like-

46:19.000 --> 46:20.240
With everything we've seen at this point?

46:20.240 --> 46:23.400
No, you're rolling sanity for making him choke

46:23.400 --> 46:25.260
and basically torturing him.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.400
He's crying on the ground right now.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.280
I mean, Keith did that.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.720
Plus, Drew told us it would happen.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.060
It's not like it was unexpected.

46:32.060 --> 46:34.760
So you're cool with just being like, yeah, that's fine.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.440
No, apparently not because I rolled a 97.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.500
John, this hits you deep.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.560
This hits you so deep.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.500
You feel like all at once you're like,

46:45.500 --> 46:47.560
oh, I could have stopped Keith from doing that.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.160
And we could have asked Drew

46:49.160 --> 46:51.560
if we could have made it more comfy on him somehow

46:51.560 --> 46:53.400
or at least gotten him out of cuffs

46:53.400 --> 46:57.080
before we got him like choking violently on the ground,

46:57.080 --> 47:00.900
gasping for air, unable to like see any future

47:00.900 --> 47:02.640
for himself in that moment.

47:02.640 --> 47:05.040
I do not regret keeping him cuffed

47:05.040 --> 47:08.160
while we tested out the magical item

47:08.160 --> 47:09.900
with only his word for what it did.

47:09.900 --> 47:11.360
I think that's super fair.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.080
Lose one sanity.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.640
I failed my roll.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.640
You're gonna lose one sanity as well.

47:16.640 --> 47:19.420
That makes me hit my breaking point on the dot.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.660
Okay, well, let's roll on the table, baby.

47:22.660 --> 47:25.160
I'm gonna get Thomas and Luke out of here.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.000
Bye.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.960
So you're gonna roll a D100 three times

47:28.960 --> 47:31.280
while I pull up the core rule book

47:31.280 --> 47:33.720
for Call of Cthulhu seventh edition.

47:36.040 --> 47:38.240
Got a 56,

47:39.800 --> 47:41.200
a 98,

47:42.840 --> 47:44.120
and an 89.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.080
That's weird.

47:45.080 --> 47:47.000
Also to calculate breaking point,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.600
it's your sanity minus power.

47:49.600 --> 47:52.200
Sanity minus power.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.020
Correct.

47:53.020 --> 47:55.720
So I've got a new breaking point of six.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.000
One more mania to go.

47:58.760 --> 48:02.800
All right, yeah, we're gonna do a mania on the first one

48:02.800 --> 48:05.080
and a phobia on the second one.

48:05.080 --> 48:09.640
How about, how about mania?

48:10.760 --> 48:14.880
All righty, Joe, you rolled a 56,

48:14.880 --> 48:19.000
which is ichthyomania.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.300
Oh my God.

48:20.300 --> 48:21.140
Is it fish?

48:21.140 --> 48:22.840
It's an obsession with fish.

48:22.840 --> 48:23.680
Yup.

48:24.680 --> 48:28.400
Well, I think we got our winner right off the bat.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.240
Pretty much.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.400
Just to hit the other ones,

48:32.400 --> 48:37.200
98 is typhlomania, which is pathological blindness.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.040
Okay.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.140
And then scribblomania, obsession with scribbling

48:41.140 --> 48:42.960
or doodling, that would have been good for.

48:42.960 --> 48:44.520
If we didn't have a fish thing in there,

48:44.520 --> 48:46.960
we could have had that.

48:46.960 --> 48:50.840
Yeah, so it's an obsession with fish.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.320
The way that I should play this though,

48:52.320 --> 48:54.680
is like when they are present, right?

48:54.680 --> 48:58.040
Like I don't have to like seek out fish from now on, right?

48:58.040 --> 49:02.220
I think maybe now and then you can seek out fish

49:02.220 --> 49:03.860
if you would like to.

49:03.860 --> 49:07.120
Maybe if Clark Bishop, oh, I brought them back too soon,

49:07.120 --> 49:10.400
but otherwise you don't need, yeah.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.600
When you guys rolled sanity,

49:15.600 --> 49:18.840
Thomas rolled over his power, did Joe as well?

49:18.840 --> 49:23.300
No, I did not, I rolled a 34 on an 18, on a 19.

49:23.300 --> 49:27.440
Okay, so as Drew spits some more blood out of his mouth,

49:27.440 --> 49:29.620
he's kind of like leaning up as Clark Bishop

49:29.620 --> 49:31.340
is like helping him up.

49:31.340 --> 49:32.900
I think maybe even losing the sanity,

49:32.900 --> 49:34.660
like helping him up even quicker,

49:34.660 --> 49:36.920
like, oh shit, what have I done kind of thing.

49:36.920 --> 49:41.920
He's like, yeah, Tildy, yeah, Tildy is a dark room.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.340
Does he still have the carpet like hanging out of his mouth?

49:45.340 --> 49:46.180
Yeah.

49:46.180 --> 49:47.000
I want to pull it out for him.

49:47.000 --> 49:47.840
Thank you.

49:47.880 --> 49:49.480
Who are you going to ask about?

49:51.320 --> 49:53.560
Keith, I don't want to put him through that again.

49:53.560 --> 49:54.560
That was awful.

49:54.560 --> 49:57.240
That's a worst case scenario deal right there.

49:57.240 --> 49:59.740
John is running off into the field

49:59.740 --> 50:02.440
and it looks like he's trying to pull his own head off.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.200
John.

50:05.200 --> 50:07.160
You just hear him, like he's screaming

50:07.160 --> 50:08.760
and it just starts like it's fading

50:08.760 --> 50:10.160
a little bit in the distance.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.980
Keith watches that for a couple of seconds

50:11.980 --> 50:13.520
and then turns back to,

50:13.520 --> 50:18.120
Drew, who else did the pastor make you look for?

50:18.120 --> 50:22.180
Clark is maybe starting to head off toward John,

50:22.180 --> 50:23.160
hollering after him.

50:23.160 --> 50:26.720
You see John like trip over a golfer hole

50:26.720 --> 50:28.800
or something out in the field

50:28.800 --> 50:32.880
and he just like eats dirt and he slowly gets to his feet

50:32.880 --> 50:34.500
and he kind of like, he looks back

50:34.500 --> 50:36.460
and he shakes himself off.

50:36.460 --> 50:37.920
You're all right over there?

50:38.960 --> 50:40.780
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

50:40.780 --> 50:41.620
I'm all right.

50:41.620 --> 50:45.060
It's just a consequence of body swapping.

50:45.060 --> 50:47.100
Sometimes, you know.

50:47.100 --> 50:49.140
You gotta run, you gotta run it off.

50:49.140 --> 50:51.860
The mind gets a little at odds with the body.

50:51.860 --> 50:53.740
Kind of like why am I here, who am I,

50:53.740 --> 50:56.020
you know, what's going on, what's.

50:56.020 --> 50:56.980
I'd say I understand.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.260
It's all good, it's all good, it's all good.

50:58.260 --> 51:01.060
But if you're saying you're okay now, that sounds good.

51:01.060 --> 51:02.620
You see his arms like twitch

51:02.620 --> 51:05.860
and try to pull his head off like seemingly one more time.

51:05.860 --> 51:08.860
Then he flops him around like spaghetti

51:08.860 --> 51:11.360
and takes a big, big breath of air.

51:12.580 --> 51:16.200
And he pats his legs and like dust himself off

51:16.200 --> 51:18.780
and it starts walking back to the car.

51:18.780 --> 51:20.380
As they're out in the field,

51:20.380 --> 51:25.200
Keith asks who else the pastor wanted to look into.

51:26.380 --> 51:31.380
Yeah, you know, thankfully I just did it a few times

51:32.920 --> 51:35.520
just to find you.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.940
Did you look for all of us or just one of us or what?

51:38.940 --> 51:40.460
It was you mostly.

51:40.460 --> 51:41.300
Me.

51:41.820 --> 51:44.300
And as he says that,

51:44.300 --> 51:47.220
you see a flurry of movement in the distance.

51:47.220 --> 51:48.700
Far beyond John and Clark,

51:48.700 --> 51:52.540
both walking back through the field, there's a barn

51:52.540 --> 51:56.020
and a dark blur is whipping around from behind it,

51:56.020 --> 52:00.220
energetically bounding hurriedly into the foreground.

52:00.220 --> 52:04.220
Drew no longer sees any of you.

52:04.220 --> 52:09.220
He is only gawking eagerly at this frenzied black lab

52:09.260 --> 52:11.620
making its way toward you all.

52:11.620 --> 52:15.260
His big ass gums flapping about in the brisk

52:15.260 --> 52:19.720
December 6th wind, Drew cries out, Tyler!

52:19.720 --> 52:22.100
Yeah, Clark is, Tyler!

52:22.100 --> 52:23.940
Clark is really fucking excited.

52:53.940 --> 52:58.940
How am I the only one trying to pull over?

53:01.780 --> 53:06.780
How can you have enough drowning out of the noise?

53:12.700 --> 53:15.200
If nobody knows, nobody knows.
