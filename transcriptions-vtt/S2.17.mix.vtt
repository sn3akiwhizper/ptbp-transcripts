WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
Cock-a-doodle-doo, my chickadees.

00:03.160 --> 00:06.480
It's your mother hen, T.J. Wolf the dog here,

00:06.480 --> 00:11.240
to sit on you and increase your body temperatures

00:11.240 --> 00:14.240
with the warm embrace of my bum.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.520
I am giving you life energizing force

00:17.520 --> 00:22.400
live from 694.2 PTBP.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.280
The only radio station that broadcasts

00:25.280 --> 00:28.400
to all chickens across the dimensions.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.880
All of them hear this.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.160
They all know what you all think about them now.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.880
Be wary and beware.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.920
Hey, lean in close.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.000
Let's shake it up because I've been shook.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.980
This is me beside myself and I'm howling with Wolf

00:45.980 --> 00:50.400
at two you slashes who have nailed me to a wall

00:50.400 --> 00:53.140
with a handful of dimes in my mouth.

00:53.140 --> 00:57.320
A detailed description by user,

00:57.320 --> 01:02.200
resistor0 underscore zero was titled,

01:02.200 --> 01:06.440
My View of the Wolf and reads as follows.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.400
Wolf the dog always pops up in my mind

01:09.400 --> 01:13.000
as a crusty Chester Cheeto version wolf

01:13.000 --> 01:16.380
covered in a restaurant trash bag grease.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.600
That is all.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.280
Damn, that's fucking cold.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.860
I'm not some Chester Cheeto looking ass.

01:23.860 --> 01:26.280
I can maybe assure you of that.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.960
Chester Cheeto wishes he could get close

01:28.960 --> 01:33.520
to my beauty, my grace, my grease.

01:33.520 --> 01:38.520
And a sopping wet illustration of supposedly yours truly

01:39.100 --> 01:43.080
was provided by user, BlueBlairyBlob.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.840
Is this what I truly look like?

01:45.840 --> 01:48.720
Has anyone ever actually seen me?

01:48.720 --> 01:52.920
Can the human vision orb even perceive me?

01:52.920 --> 01:55.840
What do y'all think I even look like?

01:56.280 --> 01:57.920
Draw them and show them to me

01:57.920 --> 01:59.700
and show them to the internet.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.860
I heard you people love this worldwide web net.

02:03.860 --> 02:06.560
Sounds a little spooky to me.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.680
If you want to write up something for your wolf to howl,

02:09.680 --> 02:12.400
tag at pretending pod on the internet

02:12.400 --> 02:16.080
and reveal your true self to your internet friends.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.040
Or I guess do something rad on Reddit.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.460
I'm not sure I'm allowed to ask this of you,

02:21.460 --> 02:25.680
but it'd be oily as all get out to see recommendations

02:26.400 --> 02:31.400
for wolf the dog in 694.2 crew on big old internet places

02:31.800 --> 02:36.280
like broad RPG subreddits and niche Facebook groups

02:36.280 --> 02:38.820
and freaky deaky discords.

02:38.820 --> 02:43.000
Word of mouth is the word of the mouth.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.720
Spread the word like Uzi Fogg and cover folks

02:46.720 --> 02:48.200
and wolf the dog.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.680
It feels good when you know you've locked

02:50.680 --> 02:53.960
onto a really good new catchphrase.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.840
I'd say that calls for the news.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.960
Last time, the church doors creaked open

02:59.960 --> 03:02.820
and a group of uniform school children

03:02.820 --> 03:06.900
took on the steep incline to reach the top of the gorge

03:06.900 --> 03:10.880
on the same side where Stevie and the rest of the can crew

03:10.880 --> 03:14.400
were checking on the sopping wet fox godel.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.040
When the party of prep schoolers got close enough,

03:18.040 --> 03:21.760
Beck zoomed in and saw blood on their uniforms.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.780
And also one kid walked on all fours

03:24.780 --> 03:28.280
and one was a kangaroo that walked like a dude.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.840
And the last weird one was a humanoid

03:30.840 --> 03:32.400
with the face of a pug.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.060
And that pug face student had a Jaguar on a leash

03:36.060 --> 03:39.280
that eventually jumped toward a bright spotlight

03:39.280 --> 03:44.080
onto the unnaturally smooth cliff face and to its death.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.800
And the city action news field team shot a stunning

03:47.800 --> 03:50.880
little clip with a horrifying background.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.160
The gang in the school uniform stood there

03:54.160 --> 03:56.920
unmoving across the rift.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.560
Enough with the rift.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.260
Let's hear a riff.

04:00.260 --> 04:03.220
It's Alter Girl with My Life Is Great

04:03.220 --> 04:05.520
and It's All My Fault.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.520
And it's all my fault.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.520
Luke just said he'd say it to your faces.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.400
If you live in Australia, suck it.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.120
Oh my God, that's not the message.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.960
I know that is the, that's the message.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.960
If you live on Australia, you can probably get it.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.120
On Australia?

04:54.120 --> 04:58.160
If you live on Australia, you drink Fosters

04:58.160 --> 05:03.060
out of a ditry dude shaped like a boomerang, bitch.

05:03.060 --> 05:03.900
Oh my God.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.860
Anyway, buckle the fuck up.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.460
We're about to kill a kangaroo.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.220
Specifically because it's Australian.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.000
Dog your Barbies.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.260
Dog your Barbies.

05:19.260 --> 05:20.820
Dog your Barbies, bitches.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.500
You better dog your Barbies.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.340
Cause these boys from the Ozarks

05:25.340 --> 05:27.220
are coming from you, Australia.

05:29.140 --> 05:29.980
Coming.

05:29.980 --> 05:30.820
Coming from you.

05:30.820 --> 05:31.640
Coming from you.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.480
Coming from you.

05:33.260 --> 05:34.300
We're coming from you.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.540
We get where you're coming from,

05:35.540 --> 05:37.540
but we're going to kill your kangaroo.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.980
You guys already left.

05:40.980 --> 05:41.820
We're coming back.

05:41.820 --> 05:42.660
We're coming back.

05:42.660 --> 05:43.480
We're coming back.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.320
Just kill him.

05:45.260 --> 05:49.100
I got one job on this earth left.

05:53.380 --> 05:54.220
Is that from something?

05:54.220 --> 05:57.180
And I got one thing to do right.

05:57.180 --> 05:59.860
One thing before I can pass easy.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.360
And that's make sure that pink group pass hard.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.800
Julius always like, anytime he went to the zoo,

06:09.800 --> 06:11.420
he would see the kangaroos and be like,

06:11.420 --> 06:12.260
I can do that.

06:12.260 --> 06:13.100
I'm totally better than that.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.260
I can do that.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.260
Julius is like, shit animal.

06:20.260 --> 06:23.060
He would look down at his thighs and be like, so what?

06:24.420 --> 06:25.700
What about your pouch?

06:26.580 --> 06:29.500
That pissed him off.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.940
Cause he didn't have one.

06:30.940 --> 06:31.780
Damn.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.140
So he starts wearing a fanny pack

06:33.140 --> 06:35.420
and is immensely popular at a young age.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.680
Pretending to marsupial.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.980
Let's go.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.140
Let's get 30 seconds of silence actually.

06:41.140 --> 06:42.300
Let's kill this energy.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.140
Agreed.

06:43.140 --> 06:46.260
I was going to say kangaroo jack, crocodile Dundee,

06:46.260 --> 06:47.260
a cry in the dark.

06:47.260 --> 06:49.300
There was a crocodile person over there too.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.120
That's my bad.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.460
Wearing a school uniform.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.780
No, I was just saying Australian movies.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.160
Oh, yeah.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.460
Are there any others?

06:56.460 --> 06:57.540
Are there any?

06:57.540 --> 06:58.380
The Sapphires?

06:58.380 --> 06:59.220
No.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.620
The proposition.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.260
Ah, the proposal.

07:02.260 --> 07:04.780
What's the big epic with Nicole Kidman?

07:04.780 --> 07:05.740
Mad Max.

07:07.340 --> 07:09.300
I mean, yeah, every Mad Max is an Australian movie.

07:09.300 --> 07:13.300
I would watch a Nicole Kidman Mad Max reboot.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.540
She's got, you know, just like bring me

07:15.540 --> 07:17.100
to the theater energy these days.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.740
I don't know what it is.

07:18.740 --> 07:20.060
What was that movie, Joe?

07:20.060 --> 07:21.500
The sheep fucker's daughter.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.780
I think that was it.

07:24.780 --> 07:29.180
Welcome to episode 17 of Pretending to Be Keep.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.700
It looks like we're trending a number one improv podcast

07:32.700 --> 07:33.540
in Australia now.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.000
We were a number two.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.100
Oh, is that Luxembourg?

07:41.100 --> 07:42.420
Shout out to Luxembourg.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.620
Shout out.

07:43.620 --> 07:45.440
Luxembourgish fans, we have your back

07:45.440 --> 07:47.420
unlike those fucking Australians.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.620
No, I'm like, I want to go to Australia.

07:50.620 --> 07:51.460
It seems so cool.

07:51.460 --> 07:53.380
Oh fuck, the movie was called Australia.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.020
Oh no.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.980
Either no one's going to listen from now on

08:19.980 --> 08:21.420
or they're going to want this every time.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.660
It's going to be hard to do.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.060
Listen next week to see if we pick your country.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.460
Listen two weeks from now.

08:29.420 --> 08:30.780
Oops.

08:30.780 --> 08:33.100
Or give us money and it will be next week.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.060
So everything's fine seemingly.

08:37.060 --> 08:38.620
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:38.620 --> 08:42.300
Well, we just wrapped our day of shooting.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.740
We got that last little stinger there.

08:44.740 --> 08:45.620
It's in the can.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.620
And now we're in the can van.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.700
Julius was showing Cal how to use TikTok.

08:51.700 --> 08:52.540
What time is it?

08:52.540 --> 08:55.020
I imagine cinematically it was like the sun was setting

08:55.100 --> 08:56.060
as all that happened, right?

08:56.060 --> 08:57.300
Hondo, pee.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.620
Yeah, over those angry animal kids, people.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.900
Are they like, are they grownups?

09:02.900 --> 09:04.940
Oh, we're in like.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.540
The kids are the animals.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.200
There's six normal kids and then.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.780
I think there is six kids standing up straight.

09:11.780 --> 09:16.460
One extra bloody kid standing up straight who had a name.

09:16.460 --> 09:19.680
One who still has a name technically.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.100
We just, we didn't find it out though.

09:21.100 --> 09:24.620
Exactly, you know, I'm just describing it as people, right?

09:25.140 --> 09:25.980
I forgot to ask them their names.

09:25.980 --> 09:27.300
Yeah, you gotta yell out.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.140
Hey, Stevie, do you know any of those kids' names?

09:29.140 --> 09:29.980
No.

09:29.980 --> 09:34.980
And you guys saw that there was also the human

09:35.620 --> 09:38.260
with the pug head.

09:38.260 --> 09:39.980
That's the one I liked the least.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.540
That's the one that we killed the pet of.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.540
That is correct.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.020
And then there was a kangaroo.

09:44.020 --> 09:47.620
So you're not sure of the ages from either of them.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.460
Yeah, the kid who was on the ground is a kid crawling.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.100
Yeah, the kid on his knuckles dragging, that's a kid.

09:53.140 --> 09:55.540
You've got the pug man.

09:55.540 --> 09:58.660
That is a much taller creature, humanoid,

09:58.660 --> 09:59.780
than the children.

09:59.780 --> 10:01.500
And then kangaroo is kangaroo.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.320
Fully kangaroo?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.160
I would say.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.420
Oh no, you said walking kind of human-like.

10:04.420 --> 10:09.420
Walking almost up on its toes to walk more human-like.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.900
I can't wait until Slide Whistle draws the pug man.

10:11.900 --> 10:12.740
Oh.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.500
Please?

10:15.500 --> 10:16.820
Please.

10:16.820 --> 10:20.860
And we're reviewing, we're seeing this on video

10:20.860 --> 10:22.700
as we're driving back to the.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.620
That's right, and you're driving on these roads.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.820
So we got everything out of the lockers without a hitch.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.260
I was a little worried that there would be something

10:29.260 --> 10:30.100
in the lockers. I'm not gonna do that

10:30.100 --> 10:31.100
to you, huh? Okay.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.880
Everything that you brought, you grabbed.

10:32.880 --> 10:33.980
You had enough time there.

10:33.980 --> 10:36.820
You took the time to shoot a little segment, you know,

10:36.820 --> 10:38.520
and nothing bad happened.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.940
It was intimidating how they just stood there silently

10:40.940 --> 10:43.880
for like 15 minutes while we shot our segment

10:43.880 --> 10:45.380
and then packed up leisurely.

10:45.380 --> 10:46.620
It felt very ominous.

10:46.620 --> 10:50.700
We do need to make sure that Fox doesn't die.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.340
Oh, I don't wanna touch that wet freak.

10:52.340 --> 10:56.300
Do you guys have any zip ties or something like that?

10:56.300 --> 10:57.300
We could do his hands.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.980
Julius already got his shoes.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.580
And you look down and see that his shoes are tied.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.400
Together? Together.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.820
Not just individually, nicely.

11:03.820 --> 11:07.980
Way to tie, that was very kind of you, to tie God's shoes.

11:07.980 --> 11:10.140
Together, in a tripping formation.

11:10.140 --> 11:12.740
We definitely have zip ties in the can van.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.820
Yeah. Like that supplies.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.540
And you would like duct tape and everything.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.980
Yeah, you guys are awful people.

11:18.980 --> 11:19.820
Yeah, of course.

11:19.820 --> 11:21.020
No. No, oh, right.

11:21.020 --> 11:21.980
We're a film crew.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.700
We have useful things.

11:23.700 --> 11:28.100
And she throws on the zip ties behind the back of Fox Coddle

11:28.100 --> 11:30.120
and he is still unconscious.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.780
And she's like, I guess we should try

11:31.780 --> 11:35.060
to make him comfortable that way he stays this way

11:35.060 --> 11:36.180
as long as possible.

11:36.180 --> 11:37.260
Stevie, I don't wanna get lost

11:37.260 --> 11:38.900
in the weeds here theologically.

11:38.900 --> 11:40.280
You know, have you ever heard about like,

11:40.280 --> 11:42.560
could God microwave a burrito so hot

11:42.560 --> 11:43.820
he himself could not eat it?

11:43.820 --> 11:44.900
Oh, whoa.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.660
If this is really God, can he just break some zip ties?

11:47.660 --> 11:50.140
Is he constrained by the limits of his physical form?

11:50.180 --> 11:53.540
Well, I have to assume he was a turtle for a reason.

11:53.540 --> 11:55.940
How do we get him back into something like a turtle?

11:55.940 --> 11:59.100
I think we gotta like kill him when he's around a turtle.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.100
That's the mayor.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.900
Oh yeah, we gotta like decree the turtle,

12:01.900 --> 12:03.440
the new mayor, then kill him.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.860
Do we have to kill him?

12:04.860 --> 12:07.500
Maybe not, maybe just decreeing a new mayor

12:07.500 --> 12:09.820
makes it like automatically transfer.

12:09.820 --> 12:10.660
Let's try.

12:11.660 --> 12:13.780
Okay, who am I gonna make the new mayor?

12:13.780 --> 12:16.540
Let's think about this maybe a lot more.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.740
Beck wants to be filming out the back window,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.380
keeping an eye and make sure we're not being followed

12:20.380 --> 12:21.220
out of the gates of the wall.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.500
Oh, you just keep seeing these signs

12:23.500 --> 12:27.100
that are like dead end, road stops here,

12:27.100 --> 12:29.500
no outlet, please stop.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.060
There's like some danger signs.

12:32.060 --> 12:34.560
And you're on this road all by yourselves

12:34.560 --> 12:38.740
and there's no streets that are like coming off

12:38.740 --> 12:40.740
of these streets, do you know what I mean?

12:40.740 --> 12:41.660
Do you know what I mean?

12:41.660 --> 12:44.900
Julius wants to, not all of them at the same time

12:44.900 --> 12:46.000
because the algorithm,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.620
but upload at least one crazy TikTok.

12:49.460 --> 12:53.460
Let's find out which TikTok.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.140
You took a few while we were there.

12:55.140 --> 12:58.000
Should we actually pause and like figure out what they were?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.900
Okay, there was the at the very end,

12:59.900 --> 13:02.940
the year dance before we got attacked by the Jaguar.

13:02.940 --> 13:03.760
Sure.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.740
When we were getting onto the train.

13:05.740 --> 13:06.580
That's right.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.340
Technically that includes the Jaguar attack.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.060
He hits the window as you were filming,

13:11.060 --> 13:12.540
so it's got all that.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.500
Right, but then there's one of us.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.340
That's what I was talking about.

13:15.340 --> 13:17.680
Yeah, we got on the train before we got back off

13:17.680 --> 13:20.040
to rescue Chuck.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.440
So there's that one and I think that one includes us

13:22.440 --> 13:24.320
doing funny walks, sneaking.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.760
Yes, there is the good sneaking one across the plant wall.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.800
And I assume it also has you pointing it right in my face

13:30.800 --> 13:32.840
as I say turn that off and get on the fucking train.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.280
That's in that one.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.560
There's also the one where you're in the it pitch.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.240
Yeah, with all the crazy symbols and stuff.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.080
Yep, behind.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.480
Previous to that.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.280
I'm sure I got the Jack.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.800
Did I get the Jackalope attack?

13:45.920 --> 13:47.080
Yes, exactly.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.480
That is the headline here.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.880
Jackalope attack.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.600
It totally got me, dude.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.880
It snuck up on me with malicious intent.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.040
It wasn't my fault.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.480
Sometimes spin is morally justified.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.320
Whoa.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.680
That's heavy.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.840
He's gonna do the Jackalope attack.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.720
Whichever one you think.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.720
You know more about this kid stuff than me.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.560
Beck, is it okay if I show this?

14:10.560 --> 14:12.300
I think that's like probably the best one

14:12.300 --> 14:13.800
because in the end of it,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.280
it's just a rabbit with horns tied onto it.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.320
It gives a taste of the thing that is crazy,

14:18.320 --> 14:19.680
but it's not the craziest.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.080
Or do we show something crazier and tease it?

14:22.080 --> 14:25.280
I'm sure that one was showing Grover's Gorge

14:25.280 --> 14:27.080
and then, oh no, Jackalope attack.

14:27.080 --> 14:27.920
Oh no, oh no.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.280
Once we make the choice, we should have to roll to see.

14:31.280 --> 14:35.760
That's the song that plays when he zooms in on my leg wounds.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.440
Oh, perfect.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.600
So now we need to do an algorithm roll

14:39.600 --> 14:42.720
to see how well it favors us.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.600
How well it favors us.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.920
Is that audio being used?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.360
Do you think this is a straight up luck roll?

14:46.360 --> 14:47.440
Oh yeah, defo.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.880
Luke had a giant landing pad of a dice rolling tray

14:56.880 --> 14:58.360
and missed the tray.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.640
Threw it behind his head.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.520
It fell out of my hand as I shook it.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.920
He threw it behind his head.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.720
Well, it's a 92.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.080
You know what that means.

15:08.080 --> 15:08.960
Spend some luck.

15:08.960 --> 15:09.780
Do you have luck?

15:09.780 --> 15:10.880
So we can go viral?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.920
Yeah, I'll spend luck so we can go viral.

15:14.440 --> 15:18.800
What is your, no, what's your notification sound bite?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.240
And also give me your luck coin.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.320
There's my luck coin.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.160
Flick it.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.440
Nice.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.280
So good.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.920
What's the notification on the phone?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.040
Yeah, what's the noise?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.320
Obama saying, yes, we can.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.680
What noise do you mean though?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.400
Like that he received the notification noise?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.480
I assume he means it's about to start blasting off.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.600
Yeah, I was just gonna do a bunch of them over and over.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.760
So I guess I'll drop that in here.

15:42.760 --> 15:43.600
Yes, we can.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.300
Si, se puede.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.140
Yes, we can.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.420
Yes, we can.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.660
Yes, we can.

15:49.660 --> 15:50.500
Yes, we can.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.320
Yes, we can.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.160
Yes, we can.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.000
Yes, we can.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Thank you, Mr. President.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.480
And we're back.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.040
Your phone is just lighting up.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.840
And so is Julius's face.

16:00.780 --> 16:01.620
Cal.

16:01.620 --> 16:02.800
Which he's picking at furiously.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.400
When Cal hears Obama's voice,

16:04.400 --> 16:06.100
he like legitimately gets a tear.

16:08.280 --> 16:09.440
I miss that man.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.960
And we're driving.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.760
Hey, Stevie, like now we've seen this like transfer of God

16:15.760 --> 16:17.280
or whatever twice.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.100
And both times it was a thing.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.880
Their eyes just get fucking huge when you say that.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.600
Both times it was a thing leaping off of a thing.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.040
Is that like part of it?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.740
Without looking away,

16:26.740 --> 16:30.120
you're looking in the rear view mirror at Stevie's face,

16:30.120 --> 16:32.400
which is pointed directly at the road.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.000
No flinching, no moving, just yeah, I,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.760
They used to say that's how it would change bodies.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.200
The original mayor, they were so scared

16:43.200 --> 16:46.560
that he was gonna come back like he was

16:46.560 --> 16:50.080
that they put a cage around his coffin.

16:50.080 --> 16:50.920
Crumpy?

16:50.920 --> 16:52.840
That's right, Jeremiah Crumpy.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.400
And the story goes would,

16:55.400 --> 16:57.280
and they kind of take their hand

16:57.280 --> 16:59.480
and do the like under the chin,

16:59.480 --> 17:01.160
throw the hand back and forth thing.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.760
Throw their hand back and forth.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.400
Throw their hand back and forth.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.960
Throw their hand back and forth.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.080
But it's like just that they kill themselves.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.520
It's not necessarily that they leap off of something.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.800
Yeah, a leap of faith as it were.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.960
I have a theory on that, but I don't want to bring it up.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.200
Here's the deal, like do we need to keep,

17:18.200 --> 17:20.400
Hey Zach, do you call it the leap of faith in your notes?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.440
Did I nail that?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.080
I'm just wondering if we need to keep Fox away from ledges.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.080
It's a little smile.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.600
I mean, I think it's a good idea

17:28.600 --> 17:30.240
to keep Fox away from ledges.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.760
Or do we have to keep them away from like fucking everything?

17:32.760 --> 17:35.640
I think that's the probably one that we should go with.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.000
Like we're going to have to like,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.560
what'd you say keep them in a cage?

17:38.560 --> 17:39.400
Well.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.400
I've got a basement in my townhouse.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.840
You can't jump off of that.

17:43.840 --> 17:47.600
Do the mayors have any like any idea what's going on

17:47.600 --> 17:49.480
or are they basically zombies?

17:49.480 --> 17:53.640
Well, the only one that I knew was Sandro and,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.040
Rest in peace little guy.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.120
Until Chuck and the only thing we,

17:58.120 --> 17:59.680
what did you get out of Chuck?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.520
It seemed like he was pretty much driven

18:01.520 --> 18:03.280
to throw himself off that gorge.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.080
I met Jeremiah Krumpy, but long after he was deceased.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.800
What do you, what are you talking about Julius?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.720
What is this Krumpy stuff?

18:11.720 --> 18:13.760
What is this Krumpy stuff?

18:13.760 --> 18:16.160
He's buried behind Fox's house

18:16.160 --> 18:17.920
and I tripped over his grave.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.360
He was the original mayor.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.200
Yeah.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.120
They caged his grave site.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.240
Yeah, I thought it was a bit odd,

18:22.240 --> 18:25.040
but I thought maybe it was to keep kids off of it.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.480
They used to do it for witches and vampires,

18:27.480 --> 18:28.720
you know, in the fifties.

18:28.720 --> 18:33.360
So, I mean, we got to keep him locked up.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.280
Yeah, that's my biggest fear is that when he gets conscious,

18:36.280 --> 18:38.280
he's just going to start like grabbing scissors

18:38.280 --> 18:39.520
and poking them in his eye.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.000
Yeah, that's, and she points at the zip ties.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.360
Man, when we get back in Cal, Colorado's on Bumble

18:46.360 --> 18:47.720
and trying to have a dinner date,

18:47.720 --> 18:50.320
while God is in his basement trying to kill himself.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.720
That's going to be great.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.320
I think we're on to something.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.520
Tell me about that basement.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.680
Oh no, it's not finished.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.520
Even better.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.480
Yeah, I guess like no one will go down there.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.680
Oh, I thought you were, we were on the date.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.360
No, no, God will be quite comfortable in the basement,

19:18.360 --> 19:19.200
I think.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.680
We're calling him God, this is God.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.520
We're saying this is God.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.120
No, it's just, it's Greg.

19:23.120 --> 19:23.960
Greg.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.080
I mean, that's just Greg.

19:25.080 --> 19:25.920
Greg.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.760
Gregle.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.600
Gregertle.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.440
Don't make it weird.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.720
I mean, it can just be Greg

19:29.720 --> 19:32.640
and hopefully we can get this thing, whatever it is out.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.720
Sorry, sorry.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.640
Wait, was Greg Fox's name?

19:35.640 --> 19:38.520
Yeah, before he got God.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.120
Once this footage is released,

19:40.120 --> 19:43.400
I bet some authority would want to take him.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.680
I'm all screwed up about like what's right and wrong here

19:46.680 --> 19:47.520
at this point.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.200
But if it is God, do you think we have like an obligation

19:52.200 --> 19:55.240
to like keep that to ourselves

19:55.240 --> 19:58.120
and like make sure that he doesn't do bad things or?

19:58.120 --> 20:01.960
I understood it as not actual God,

20:01.960 --> 20:03.800
but he did go to church.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.640
Whatever it is, it seems to be a very dangerous

20:09.640 --> 20:10.760
and powerful thing.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.440
And I think you're right, Beck.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.160
I don't know who we can trust with this shit.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.920
I think we leave him out of the edit,

20:15.920 --> 20:17.000
if you know what I mean.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.760
And maybe don't mention he came back to town.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.600
Yeah.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.480
I guess like our first like thing would be to try

20:23.520 --> 20:27.160
just like declaring like you have a pet goldfish

20:27.160 --> 20:29.720
that we can say is the new mayor and just see if that works.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.720
No, Goldie died several weeks ago.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.560
Oh, Cal.

20:32.560 --> 20:36.200
Maybe something that lives a lot longer than a goldfish,

20:36.200 --> 20:37.280
like a rock.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.880
I do have a pet rock somewhere.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.400
Dude, can we make a rock God?

20:41.400 --> 20:45.040
Could you make a rock so God that even God couldn't rock it?

20:45.040 --> 20:47.520
I'll show you a rock God.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.640
Whom?

20:49.640 --> 20:50.460
Bon Jovi.

20:50.460 --> 20:51.920
Thank you.

20:51.920 --> 20:52.760
What'd you say?

20:52.880 --> 20:53.760
We met our editor, Cole.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.840
Oh, nice.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.480
Here's what I propose.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.040
We cut the story and get the word out to the world

21:02.040 --> 21:03.560
about what they're doing there.

21:03.560 --> 21:06.740
I don't think we should tell anyone we have Greg.

21:06.740 --> 21:07.580
Agreed.

21:07.580 --> 21:08.920
But everything else?

21:08.920 --> 21:10.160
Everything else.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.120
Everything else.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.520
Everything else.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.360
Yeah.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.200
Everything else.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.500
That's for Greg's safety, the world's safety

21:17.500 --> 21:18.360
and our own safety.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.400
We don't know who would wanna come for us.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.640
Right now, it's those weird fucking kids

21:22.640 --> 21:23.680
who know we have them.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.840
Dude, when the world sees the footage, though,

21:26.840 --> 21:29.860
like, we are going to change the world, yo.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.920
This is the biggest story of the last 50 years.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.860
I'm sorry, I forgot about 9-11.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.700
Heh.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.320
Moment of silence.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.140
It's obviously not as big as 9-11.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.200
Moment of silence.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.480
Moment of silence.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.900
You don't think this is a bigger deal than 9-11?

21:45.900 --> 21:49.400
This could potentially be as big as 9-11.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.880
Do you think season two will be as big as 9-11?

21:52.880 --> 21:56.760
This podcast is bigger than the Beatles.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.520
Moment of silence complete.

22:00.520 --> 22:04.280
Okay, so like, yeah, the plan is get Greg, God,

22:04.280 --> 22:06.920
Greg God into Cal's basement.

22:06.920 --> 22:07.760
Okay.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.940
We'll go to the pet store, find a turtle,

22:09.940 --> 22:11.600
and we'll just see if that works.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.120
And like, if that doesn't work, we're back to square one,

22:14.120 --> 22:15.480
but at least we tried something.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.240
We obviously do that after we show the news.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.620
Oh yeah, and like that, and like change the world

22:20.620 --> 22:22.280
in the process, yeah, of course.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.840
So we're gonna go, like, take the footage

22:24.840 --> 22:26.600
and drop it off first, and then take Greg?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.760
As the producer, that's definitely what I say.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.080
No, no, no, we need to get Greg in the basement,

22:31.080 --> 22:33.220
but then Stevie and I could maybe take care of him

22:33.220 --> 22:35.280
and you two can put the cut together.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.360
I look over at Julius, are you still at like,

22:38.360 --> 22:41.000
two hit points, are you still like, bloody as hell?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.920
Yes, and I'm like, picking the skin that's on my face

22:44.920 --> 22:47.920
is like, yanking at it and like, kind of stripping it off.

22:48.520 --> 22:51.520
We also gotta give Julius to a goddamn hospital.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.140
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Greg, Julius.

22:56.140 --> 22:59.200
No, no, the news before me.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.480
You didn't happen to pack one of those,

23:01.480 --> 23:04.040
you know, magic, God'll heal things, did you?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.920
Oh, I didn't even think about it.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.440
That would have been so handy, aw.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.780
Good thing I grabbed one.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.960
We can always count on you, Beck.

23:12.960 --> 23:13.800
95.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.360
You failed your role, so I do have it,

23:19.360 --> 23:20.180
is that what you meant?

23:20.180 --> 23:21.020
Yeah.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.760
That's the Zach Luck role that he failed.

23:24.760 --> 23:27.000
I guess, I mean, I wanna see this cut

23:27.000 --> 23:28.640
before I go to the news, but I mean,

23:28.640 --> 23:30.280
we could get rid of God first.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.200
Julius, can I see your hands for a second?

23:32.200 --> 23:33.240
He holds his hands up.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.480
I wrapped some gaffer tape around him, so you can't.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.320
Whoa!

23:37.200 --> 23:39.320
Take your last two hit points away

23:39.320 --> 23:40.600
by picking at your face.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.360
He's gonna try to fight that

23:42.600 --> 23:43.720
just because he doesn't want it to happen,

23:43.720 --> 23:45.400
but I think that's a good idea.

23:48.040 --> 23:51.520
All right, let's see a little unarmed combat going on here.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.360
Uh-oh.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.000
I got a crit success.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.560
Oh, damn.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.840
Well, that's just a crit success to not get.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:00.320 --> 24:03.120
So as you like nimbly blasted away.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.320
You kill Calcala.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.080
You dodge and he's, I wanna try to persuade you

24:09.080 --> 24:10.160
that this is a good idea.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.560
I'm like, I understand, I understand,

24:11.600 --> 24:13.080
I should have just come at you like that,

24:13.080 --> 24:15.200
but I think we might need to get your hands

24:15.200 --> 24:16.480
under control here for a second

24:16.480 --> 24:18.400
before you poltergeist your own head.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.240
Yeah.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.920
You can roll if you want, but because you crit,

24:20.920 --> 24:22.440
I'm gonna go ahead and say like,

24:22.440 --> 24:24.680
you can just like tell him to fuck off if you want.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.000
I'll roll my persuade, like it says to,

24:28.080 --> 24:29.600
I got a 43 on a 60.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.640
I got a 63 on a 70.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.480
Ooh!

24:32.480 --> 24:34.960
Oh, no, sorry, a 36.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.800
Oh.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.640
Boom.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.480
What'd you roll?

24:37.480 --> 24:38.300
A 43.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.140
Better than that.

24:39.140 --> 24:39.960
So I.

24:39.960 --> 24:40.800
Whiplash!

24:40.880 --> 24:42.200
Picking at his face.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.960
Okay, yeah, so, okay, good talk, Julius.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.120
He's picking at his face,

24:48.120 --> 24:51.040
but then Julius is like in his notes on his phone,

24:51.040 --> 24:53.880
like writing down thoughts on different ways to cut this.

24:53.880 --> 24:54.720
The video.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.120
The footage, yeah.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.120
And his face off.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.520
All right, I need you guys to, someone,

25:02.520 --> 25:05.100
I need you to elect a rolling leader

25:05.100 --> 25:08.960
who has a D8 closest to them.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.560
Luke, Luke is gonna roll the D8.

25:11.160 --> 25:15.240
To see how many eighths of gas are in this gas tank.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.300
More like eighths of something else,

25:18.300 --> 25:19.400
you know what I mean?

25:19.400 --> 25:20.720
Weed.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.560
Eight.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.400
Hell yeah.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.220
Full tank.

25:23.220 --> 25:24.440
They filled it up while we parked.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.960
Compliments of Grover's Gulch.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.200
Yeah, come back and see us.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.560
You're only a few hours away.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.240
It's about as full as a tank could possibly be

25:33.240 --> 25:35.200
after driving this distance.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.280
We stopped at a gas station right before we pulled off.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.680
The same gas station is approaching on your right

25:40.680 --> 25:42.800
and it is the first building

25:42.800 --> 25:45.480
that you really see on this side of civilization.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.680
You seem to be coming back onto a road

25:47.680 --> 25:49.680
that might be used for more

25:49.680 --> 25:52.960
than just heading out to this location.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.080
And as you come up to this gas station,

25:56.080 --> 26:00.960
you see that there are three black SUVs.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.620
No, that's not fun.

26:02.620 --> 26:06.160
There are three pink SUVs.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.600
Now that's fun.

26:09.000 --> 26:09.840
Spaceships.

26:09.840 --> 26:10.680
Camels.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.500
Kangaroos.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.340
Helicopters.

26:12.340 --> 26:14.720
There are three green.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.220
Roombas.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.920
Range Rovers.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.520
Like bright green Range Rovers.

26:21.520 --> 26:26.520
And they are all parked in a line at three pumps.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.360
It's probably nothing to worry about.

26:29.780 --> 26:32.400
Simultaneously the doors open

26:32.400 --> 26:37.400
and men wearing monochromatic gray scale suits

26:39.200 --> 26:43.160
with a green accent being their tie and their,

26:43.160 --> 26:45.140
what's the thing that goes in your pocket?

26:45.140 --> 26:46.980
Pocket square.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.760
And their green pocket square and their green tie

26:49.760 --> 26:52.540
get out and begin pumping gas.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.160
What's the matter, Stevie?

26:56.160 --> 26:58.720
That's jolly green jottles.

26:59.240 --> 27:03.440
Golly, dream goggles.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.600
Jolly green jottles.

27:06.180 --> 27:07.640
Jolly green jottles.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.960
I just, that, yeah, that's them.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.440
I guess just keep your heads forward and don't.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.840
Everybody act casual.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.940
Julius, pretend to do a TikTok.

27:19.940 --> 27:23.920
Julius is like writing notes on his thoughts on the edit.

27:23.920 --> 27:24.760
That looks like a TikTok.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.680
He just like does a little dance.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.360
As far as Kal knows, you're doing a TikTok.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.320
Great job, great job.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.360
Great job.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.200
Great job.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.560
You totally looped that roll.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.080
And as you continue to drive,

27:43.080 --> 27:46.100
as you're almost past this gas station,

27:46.100 --> 27:50.440
you see one of the side doors opens from the back

27:50.440 --> 27:53.640
of one of these green Range Rovers and out steps.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.920
Fred Godel.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.960
He was on his way back.

27:56.960 --> 27:57.800
I forgot.

27:57.800 --> 27:58.880
Oh, shit.

27:58.880 --> 27:59.720
We knew that.

27:59.720 --> 28:04.300
And he squints as he looks at the can van

28:04.300 --> 28:07.080
driving back toward the city.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.220
You guys are back in the can van, heading down the road.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.960
You're back in the normal world.

28:11.960 --> 28:14.480
So you're seeing homes, you're seeing normal signs.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.760
Please stop and interview him.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.040
Julius says, looking like,

28:20.120 --> 28:23.280
he says it as a statement, but it's really as a question.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.440
No, no.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.040
No, Julius, we will die if we talk to that man.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.680
We've also got his daughter with us right now.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.080
And his son.

28:32.080 --> 28:32.920
Son.

28:32.920 --> 28:33.880
Whoa.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.280
Let's not forget, we also have the mayor of his town.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.160
Shit.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.000
And?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.300
Oh, I'm not going back.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.140
She's driving.

28:40.140 --> 28:42.380
Yeah, she's like, fuck that, Julius.

28:42.380 --> 28:43.840
I'm not doing that shit.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.640
He knew that was the correct answer, but he had to ask.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.480
Do you think he saw you, Stevie?

28:50.520 --> 28:53.400
She's just like frozen this whole time

28:53.400 --> 28:55.840
in the rear view mirror, just staring.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.080
Oh shit, Stevie, jackalope.

28:57.080 --> 28:57.920
Ugh.

28:59.460 --> 29:02.440
And you see a rabbit with a stick

29:02.440 --> 29:04.840
like kind of like stuck to it almost.

29:04.840 --> 29:05.680
Like it's.

29:05.680 --> 29:06.500
Like some burrs.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.340
Yeah, it kind of got caught up.

29:07.340 --> 29:08.160
At the end of a twig.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.000
Yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.240
Stevie, what?

29:10.240 --> 29:11.400
She smashes it.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.160
Oh, that poor little jackalope.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.240
Stevie, what were the circumstances

29:17.240 --> 29:19.240
of you leaving Grower's Gorge?

29:19.240 --> 29:22.200
Still driving, still working in the rear view mirror.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.280
Who's hitting shotgun?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.120
Probably Cal.

29:24.120 --> 29:27.120
I figured we were all in the back like figuring shit out.

29:27.120 --> 29:27.960
Yeah, that's good.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.220
Looking at footage and tying up Fox.

29:30.220 --> 29:31.200
Beck is getting a shot

29:31.200 --> 29:33.240
of whatever Stevie's response is gonna be.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.820
Yeah, no, I saw.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.400
You know that moment when you find out

29:39.400 --> 29:41.640
that maybe your parents aren't good?

29:41.640 --> 29:43.400
I don't know if you've ever had that.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.240
Yes.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.800
So that's a weird feeling.

29:45.800 --> 29:50.800
And when I kind of saw what I had tied my life to,

29:51.480 --> 29:55.000
what I was born into, I couldn't hang.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.280
So I'd been talking to Susan.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.760
Susan's the judge.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.280
Susan Bloom, Judge Bloom.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.240
And then Susan was helping.

30:03.240 --> 30:05.480
I mean, we were trying to help, but.

30:05.480 --> 30:06.640
Help how?

30:06.640 --> 30:08.920
Well, I mean, you saw the it pit.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.800
You know, we were trying to save the new visitors.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.900
So sometimes people would just kind of appear

30:14.900 --> 30:16.440
and it wasn't just people.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.460
It was like all sorts of things and creatures

30:18.460 --> 30:19.500
like we saw back there.

30:19.500 --> 30:23.980
And we were trying to help them because what would I mean?

30:23.980 --> 30:26.580
Vernon would take them and put them in the it pit

30:26.580 --> 30:28.140
because that's what Fred needed.

30:28.140 --> 30:32.100
And we didn't really see them again after that.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.780
Because Fred needed them to be quiet

30:33.780 --> 30:36.820
or because he needed them to die in the it pit?

30:36.820 --> 30:38.540
I think he needed something from them.

30:38.540 --> 30:40.580
I don't know exactly what,

30:40.580 --> 30:43.620
but we found animal ears down there also.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.580
Now that we've seen animal people,

30:45.580 --> 30:47.380
it was like transforming them?

30:47.380 --> 30:51.460
No, I mean, they were showing up like all sorts of things.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.020
Oh, they were starting animal-ly.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.620
Yeah, they were just popping into Grover's Gorge.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.020
We started getting the visitors

30:57.020 --> 30:58.820
and I mean, I got out of there quick.

30:58.820 --> 31:00.740
Susan and I tried to do what we could,

31:00.740 --> 31:02.780
but it wasn't too long after that.

31:02.780 --> 31:05.260
And their eyes just kind of fade away

31:05.260 --> 31:09.180
and you see it's something cut deep enough

31:09.180 --> 31:12.380
to leave everything they knew behind.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.060
And she just can't bring herself.

31:14.060 --> 31:16.780
She, despite of all that, let you go to the it pit.

31:16.780 --> 31:18.980
She knew that if she said anything,

31:18.980 --> 31:23.980
she'd be in their same position.

31:24.020 --> 31:24.860
I understand.

31:24.860 --> 31:26.460
Stevie, we are not our families.

31:26.460 --> 31:29.180
We can move beyond that and become our own people.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.020
I did.

31:30.860 --> 31:32.420
Or tried.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.660
So why'd you go back with us?

31:34.660 --> 31:36.140
We got what we needed.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.300
Hell yeah, we did.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.500
Let's shut them down.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.660
That's the spirit of a real can news intern.

31:41.780 --> 31:43.540
Let's show the world what they're doing.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.380
Let's do it.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.220
Yeah.

31:45.220 --> 31:47.220
Through the transformative power of journalism.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.460
I'm sleepy.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.220
And he's like closing his eyes.

31:50.220 --> 31:51.060
Yeah.

31:55.820 --> 31:56.980
Julius, dude, stay with me, dude.

31:56.980 --> 31:57.820
Stay with me, dude.

31:57.820 --> 31:58.980
He shakes his head back awake

31:58.980 --> 32:00.900
like he's trying to keep his eyes open.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.100
Maybe we should drop him at a hospital.

32:03.100 --> 32:03.940
No, no.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.260
The way they do in the movies where they just

32:06.260 --> 32:07.860
throw you in front of the emergency room.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.460
Julius, I hate to tell you this.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.060
I think Stevie's gonna have to help Beck with the cut.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.740
You're still my super producer.

32:15.980 --> 32:18.860
He half forcing himself to stay awake

32:18.860 --> 32:21.820
is continuing to write his thoughts down in his notes.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.220
The camera peeps over your shoulder

32:23.220 --> 32:26.380
and it's just like the same letter over and over again.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.060
It's Z, yeah.

32:28.060 --> 32:30.380
Text, try to text what you have to Stevie.

32:30.380 --> 32:34.260
He hits Z again on his keyboard.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.140
Okay, I don't feel very good.

32:36.140 --> 32:37.100
I know, little guy.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.140
Little guy with the big thighs, eh?

32:39.660 --> 32:40.700
We're gonna take care of you, right?

32:40.700 --> 32:44.140
Stevie, can we go to a doctor or something?

32:44.140 --> 32:45.340
We could get to a hospital.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.900
Is that, and she's like kinda eyeing Greg?

32:48.900 --> 32:49.900
Well, here's what we could do.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.780
We could either drop him off at a hospital

32:51.780 --> 32:54.220
or you can leave him and Greg in my basement.

32:54.220 --> 32:56.980
I'll watch him while you and Beck make the cut.

32:57.980 --> 32:58.820
Luke's face.

32:58.820 --> 33:01.820
Why would you drop me off in the basement?

33:01.820 --> 33:04.700
Well, it's whether you wanna go to a hospital or not.

33:04.700 --> 33:07.100
I mean, Julius doesn't wanna go to the hospital.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.060
What does Luke want?

33:08.060 --> 33:10.220
I don't know what Luke wants.

33:10.220 --> 33:12.060
These are just, these are the options.

33:12.060 --> 33:13.020
Luke's along for the ride.

33:13.020 --> 33:13.860
What does Julius want?

33:13.860 --> 33:15.020
I'm playing the character.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.580
Julius wants to go cut this shit together.

33:18.500 --> 33:19.340
Fuck yeah.

33:20.940 --> 33:23.060
He's got two hit points left, so.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.080
You look such a mess.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.180
It's so funny.

33:26.180 --> 33:29.860
Like you are trying to hold on by a thread at this point

33:29.860 --> 33:33.460
and it's still a fair amount of car ride left.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.060
Okay, why don't you,

33:35.060 --> 33:38.020
we'll get God situated in the basement and.

33:38.020 --> 33:40.220
And I'll go help cut the news together.

33:40.220 --> 33:42.300
Yeah, you'll show Stevie the ropes.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.220
And maybe we'll call an ambulance.

33:44.220 --> 33:46.420
Maybe we'll call an ambulance.

33:46.420 --> 33:47.860
Yeah, yeah, man.

33:47.860 --> 33:51.260
Roll Constitution to see if you can actually stay awake

33:51.260 --> 33:52.420
all the way into town.

33:53.540 --> 33:54.780
An eight on a 50.

33:54.780 --> 33:56.380
An eight on a 50's gonna keep you.

33:56.380 --> 33:59.540
The prospect of not being able to cut this together,

33:59.540 --> 34:02.020
adrenaline pumps through his veins.

34:02.020 --> 34:04.340
And the consistent rings of yes we can.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.180
Yes, exactly.

34:06.180 --> 34:07.020
Yes we can.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.300
Yes we can.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.660
Dopamine fills his brain every time he hears that.

34:11.660 --> 34:12.500
Yes we can.

34:12.500 --> 34:13.340
Yes we can.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.160
Yes we can.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.000
Yes we can.

34:15.000 --> 34:15.840
Yes we can.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.660
I can do it.

34:16.660 --> 34:17.500
I can.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.340
I can keep it together.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.980
All right, as we roll into the city,

34:20.980 --> 34:21.940
what's the first stop?

34:21.940 --> 34:23.380
And also I'm gonna go pee again.

34:23.380 --> 34:24.740
Sorry I drank so much liquid.

34:24.740 --> 34:25.600
What is the first stop?

34:25.600 --> 34:26.700
We haven't really hammered out

34:26.700 --> 34:28.540
what our order of operations here.

34:28.540 --> 34:32.580
I mean, Julius is gonna say the news tower or whatever.

34:32.580 --> 34:33.460
I'm a little nervous.

34:33.460 --> 34:34.700
I think Beck would be nervous too

34:34.700 --> 34:37.860
about leaving Godel unconscious in the van.

34:38.580 --> 34:39.480
That he could pop up at any moment.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.300
I don't know if I can deal with God alone.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.800
So Stevie can handle the cut if he passes out

34:45.800 --> 34:48.420
or goes to the emergency room or something like that, right?

34:48.420 --> 34:51.460
Can you stay here in the basement with me and watch God?

34:51.460 --> 34:54.940
I mean, yeah, but like I know what all the footage is.

34:54.940 --> 34:56.500
Like that's kind of my whole thing

34:56.500 --> 34:59.020
is to like tell him the edit.

34:59.020 --> 34:59.860
I mean.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.980
Let's just bring him with us.

35:01.980 --> 35:03.700
That is such a bad idea.

35:04.340 --> 35:09.220
Julius nods his head.

35:09.220 --> 35:11.100
Why don't we just lock him in your basement

35:11.100 --> 35:12.540
and then go do the cut?

35:12.540 --> 35:13.820
Julius nods his head.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.660
I mean, someone has to stay with him.

35:15.660 --> 35:17.260
I guess that'll be me.

35:17.260 --> 35:18.620
I don't know about that, dude.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.240
Like you said, it's God.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.280
Like if he does wake up, what are you gonna do?

35:23.280 --> 35:25.260
Well, that's why I asked one of you to stay with me

35:25.260 --> 35:27.460
but you all wanna be a part of this fucking cut.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.800
So I don't know.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.180
Is the cut more important

35:32.220 --> 35:34.060
than keeping God trapped in my basement?

35:34.060 --> 35:36.380
I don't know, Beck, but.

35:36.380 --> 35:37.220
That's my point though.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.860
It's like, what are two people versus God?

35:39.860 --> 35:44.860
Like what if we all leave and go get a turtle

35:45.060 --> 35:47.700
on our way back from cutting the film footage?

35:47.700 --> 35:48.920
Julius nods his head.

35:52.140 --> 35:52.980
I don't know Beck,

35:52.980 --> 35:54.940
but I don't think we can just leave him alone.

35:54.940 --> 35:58.220
I mean, I'm gonna stay with Greg.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.620
Especially since Julius is seemingly staying.

36:01.900 --> 36:02.960
This is not a huge deal,

36:02.960 --> 36:06.020
but just would you not use the upstairs bathroom

36:07.820 --> 36:08.660
while you're there?

36:08.660 --> 36:09.560
Is there a-

36:09.560 --> 36:10.860
There's a downstairs bathroom.

36:10.860 --> 36:11.700
Okay, cool.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.500
Yeah, no, as long as there's another one.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.140
And I don't mean on the main floor.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.060
If you do need to go up there for any reason

36:17.060 --> 36:18.060
to use the kitchen or anything,

36:18.060 --> 36:19.220
I just mean the one upstairs.

36:19.220 --> 36:20.620
There's just still some of,

36:20.620 --> 36:21.460
there's just still,

36:21.460 --> 36:22.740
there's some things my wife left

36:22.740 --> 36:24.980
that I haven't really touched.

36:24.980 --> 36:25.820
Wait, hold on.

36:25.820 --> 36:28.060
Why'd you say, oh, that's horrifying.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.860
Did she poop in your toilet?

36:29.860 --> 36:31.060
Oh, if that's what you mean,

36:31.340 --> 36:32.180
I take back the awe.

36:32.180 --> 36:34.860
No, I think it's the way that it's messily arranged,

36:34.860 --> 36:35.700
the way that she would have it.

36:35.700 --> 36:37.300
So that got her hairbrush out and-

36:37.300 --> 36:38.140
Yeah, that's what I meant too.

36:38.140 --> 36:40.180
And she had smeared all of the walls.

36:40.180 --> 36:42.320
No, there were, yes,

36:42.320 --> 36:43.160
the hairbrush,

36:44.060 --> 36:44.900
the tooth brace,

36:44.900 --> 36:46.260
which she never closed,

36:46.260 --> 36:47.220
some toiletries,

36:47.220 --> 36:48.660
and of course a bowl of shit.

36:51.260 --> 36:52.160
Please, whatever you do,

36:52.160 --> 36:53.740
do not flush the upstairs toilet.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.500
I just can't bring myself to flush it.

36:55.500 --> 37:00.500
Am I the only one who thought that?

37:02.460 --> 37:03.300
I think so.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.340
Yeah, okay.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.180
That's fine.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.000
If Taylor dies,

37:11.000 --> 37:12.900
I'm throwing all of her stuff away immediately.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.140
In the secret house you two share together?

37:17.140 --> 37:18.700
No, that was me as Zach.

37:18.700 --> 37:19.540
I knew it.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.380
Whoa.

37:20.380 --> 37:21.200
Whoa.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.040
I got that.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.740
You were pretending to be a person?

37:26.220 --> 37:28.460
Was that the world's fastest no back button?

37:30.780 --> 37:35.340
So we'll get you guys all secured in my basement

37:35.340 --> 37:37.420
and hopefully you and Greg will be fine there.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.860
And then we'll go edit this cut together

37:39.860 --> 37:40.960
like a news crew should.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.020
And bring back a turtle.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.860
And bring back a new god turtle.

37:43.860 --> 37:44.700
Okay, sick.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.740
So let's hear about the outside of Cal Colorado's house.

37:47.740 --> 37:49.220
What are we pulling up to?

37:49.220 --> 37:50.560
What's the vibe?

37:50.560 --> 37:53.520
Oh, I mean, nice ass neighborhood.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.880
Stately like early 20th century or late 1800s

37:56.880 --> 37:57.760
like townhouses.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.600
Some of them are brick.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.560
His is painted white.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.600
It's probably like three stories maybe.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.420
Whoa.

38:02.420 --> 38:04.320
And you know, it's narrow, right?

38:04.320 --> 38:05.460
It's in the middle of the city.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.280
And yeah, I don't know what time of year it is

38:07.280 --> 38:08.800
but it seems like it's fall there.

38:08.800 --> 38:09.880
It's like nice.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.480
But it seems like it's fall.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.200
It's like June 18th or somewhere around there.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.780
Specifically July something.

38:16.720 --> 38:17.840
We did start in June.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.160
I have June 18th written down.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.640
Today is July 5th.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.840
Oh, okay, yeah.

38:21.880 --> 38:24.320
So there's all these 4th of July banners and stuff.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.560
Cal has a big American flag outside the front.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.400
Nice.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.960
And yeah, you see a neat little,

38:28.960 --> 38:31.800
like a couple of like garden, whoops.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.040
What the hell's happening?

38:33.040 --> 38:34.880
It's the helicopter landing at the hospital.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.840
Helicopter.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.680
Cal says, don't worry.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.440
That's just the helicopter landing at the hospital nearby.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.560
Thank God it's closed.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.640
Yeah.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.240
So there's some nice little like window planners and shit.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.800
Julius, I could just like run you over there

38:46.800 --> 38:47.920
while they get situated.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.760
That's true.

38:48.760 --> 38:49.580
We have time.

38:49.940 --> 38:54.220
This isn't, I mean, it was sunset when we left.

38:54.220 --> 38:55.140
It's been a few hours.

38:55.140 --> 38:56.660
This is not going on tonight's news.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.300
We have all day to cut this thing.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.420
We could definitely get you some medical attention.

39:01.420 --> 39:02.260
That's right, yeah.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.860
It's like 11, 1130 p.m. now at this point.

39:04.860 --> 39:07.540
Maybe that is the order of operations now.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.500
Yeah, it's, oh my God, it's too,

39:09.500 --> 39:11.920
how did we not realize it's too late to go on the news?

39:11.920 --> 39:16.180
Because it's been a pretty discombobulating day of a day,

39:16.180 --> 39:17.020
has it not?

39:17.020 --> 39:18.580
Julius texts his uncle to see

39:18.580 --> 39:20.740
if his health insurance has kicked in yet.

39:20.740 --> 39:21.580
Yeah.

39:29.020 --> 39:30.100
Commentary.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.260
That is a great question.

39:32.260 --> 39:35.980
Sax, oh, Sax consulting the fucking can.

39:35.980 --> 39:37.780
Who has insurance or nothing.

39:37.780 --> 39:38.940
I had to check.

39:38.940 --> 39:42.300
It's like I made a full HR department for these guys.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.940
It's part of my world building process.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.420
Extensive employee records.

39:45.420 --> 39:47.540
It's like, oh, nope, sorry Julius.

39:47.540 --> 39:49.900
That doesn't kick in until the end of the month.

39:50.780 --> 39:51.740
Oh, City Action News,

39:51.740 --> 39:55.020
they actually don't provide healthcare coverage.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.500
Not to junior producers.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.820
Then call the chopper.

39:59.820 --> 40:02.420
Call the chopper.

40:02.420 --> 40:04.900
No, again, it is just several blocks away.

40:04.900 --> 40:08.900
And we're in the driveway of this beautiful brick

40:08.900 --> 40:09.980
three-story town home.

40:09.980 --> 40:12.020
We didn't want to leave God alone in the van.

40:12.020 --> 40:14.180
Can we leave Julius alone in the van for a second

40:14.180 --> 40:15.580
while we unload or?

40:15.580 --> 40:16.620
I'll help.

40:16.740 --> 40:20.780
What if you just sit right there for a moment?

40:20.780 --> 40:22.140
Keep writing your notes.

40:22.140 --> 40:22.980
Oh yeah.

40:22.980 --> 40:25.420
So I imagine we just kind of all like take them in

40:25.420 --> 40:27.060
and get them situated.

40:27.060 --> 40:30.020
There's probably a nice like couch and like sofa and shit.

40:30.020 --> 40:33.340
Julius flops down on there and continues writing his notes.

40:33.340 --> 40:35.220
I didn't think you came down to the basement with us.

40:35.220 --> 40:37.220
I was like blindly following behind

40:37.220 --> 40:39.100
while I typed in my notes.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.620
Oh, we were saying stay in the van.

40:40.620 --> 40:43.820
Yeah, no, he's following blindly behind you.

40:43.820 --> 40:46.100
I'm just trying to get us out of here quick, dude.

40:47.620 --> 40:49.460
He's following you guys.

40:49.460 --> 40:50.900
Don't you want to go to the fucking hospital?

40:50.900 --> 40:52.420
Who's holding Fox?

40:52.420 --> 40:53.340
How do we get there?

40:53.340 --> 40:54.460
That's what I was saying.

40:54.460 --> 40:56.020
I like, I imagine.

40:56.020 --> 40:56.860
Cal and Stevie.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.300
Yeah, exactly.

40:58.300 --> 41:02.380
So he is still absolutely drenched.

41:02.380 --> 41:03.220
Yeah.

41:03.220 --> 41:05.700
Sopping, making puddles everywhere

41:05.700 --> 41:07.220
that you're pulling him.

41:07.220 --> 41:10.720
Cal, like you can see this place is clean

41:10.720 --> 41:13.220
and Cal like visibly winces.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.380
And he's like, do you guys have this?

41:15.380 --> 41:16.700
Do you guys, do you guys got this?

41:16.700 --> 41:18.820
I need to mop some of this up.

41:18.820 --> 41:19.860
I'll put some tea on.

41:19.860 --> 41:22.780
And as soon as Cal steps away and says,

41:22.780 --> 41:24.180
I'll put some tea on.

41:24.180 --> 41:26.940
You see the face of Fox,

41:26.940 --> 41:29.580
Godel, Greg Godel, God Godel,

41:29.580 --> 41:32.060
slowly start to twitch.

41:32.060 --> 41:32.900
I punch him.

41:38.180 --> 41:40.180
Roll initiative with God.

41:40.180 --> 41:42.780
Okay, so you're just gonna roll damage

41:42.780 --> 41:45.060
cause you're right there.

41:46.060 --> 41:47.540
What's a fist punch?

41:47.540 --> 41:49.020
It's a D four minus one.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.220
Oh shit.

41:52.220 --> 41:53.180
One minus one.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.940
I rolled a one minus one.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.580
You wake him up like fully.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.980
Stevie's looking at me like, what the fuck dude?

42:06.980 --> 42:08.900
I'm sorry, I thought I would like knock him out again.

42:08.900 --> 42:11.580
Immediately his mouth is just foaming

42:11.580 --> 42:14.620
and like this almost sea foam is pouring out of it.

42:15.140 --> 42:18.260
And it smells and you think that you might actually

42:18.260 --> 42:20.620
as the sea foam is like pouring up out

42:20.620 --> 42:23.140
and coming out of his mouth and he's fighting.

42:23.140 --> 42:25.180
I need a first a grip check

42:25.180 --> 42:27.260
for this coming out of fucking nowhere.

42:27.260 --> 42:29.540
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:29.540 --> 42:30.620
Cal fails.

42:30.620 --> 42:31.460
Fail.

42:31.460 --> 42:32.300
Beck passes.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.460
Pass.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.420
Crit fail.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.260
Crit fail.

42:36.260 --> 42:37.940
I imagine we're like on the stairwell

42:37.940 --> 42:38.940
going down into the basement.

42:38.940 --> 42:39.780
Yeah.

42:39.780 --> 42:42.100
Okay, so Cal who has like been turning around fully

42:42.100 --> 42:44.620
just like scrambles backwards up the stairs

42:44.620 --> 42:47.180
and runs into the like into his kitchen.

42:47.180 --> 42:48.140
But right before you do,

42:48.140 --> 42:52.540
Joe takes off his headphones and Joe you lose zero grip.

42:52.540 --> 42:56.180
However, the other two headphones off sir, thank you.

42:57.780 --> 42:59.860
Julius wasn't looking until Beck yelled,

42:59.860 --> 43:00.900
I'm gonna punch him.

43:02.460 --> 43:03.580
So this is Joe's fault.

43:03.580 --> 43:06.660
You're gonna lose Cal one D four plus one,

43:06.660 --> 43:09.100
which with the crit fail means that Julius

43:09.100 --> 43:11.500
automatically loses five grip.

43:11.940 --> 43:13.900
I see my breaking point.

43:13.900 --> 43:15.340
We got a breaking point

43:15.340 --> 43:20.300
and you lose two grip Cal as the both of you see

43:20.300 --> 43:24.060
is that fingertips reaching out through the top

43:24.060 --> 43:28.620
by a little Stevie wonder of the sea foam at the mouth

43:28.620 --> 43:31.780
and like maybe a finger trying to grip at the lip

43:31.780 --> 43:33.860
and then suddenly it's gone and you just see the water

43:33.860 --> 43:35.820
and then it's just foaming at the mouth

43:35.820 --> 43:38.660
and there are multiple hands, multiple fingers

43:38.660 --> 43:42.740
reaching up through the foam, trying to get out.

43:42.740 --> 43:45.860
He closes his mouth shut tight and continues to wriggle.

43:45.860 --> 43:47.100
I'm gonna burn Joe back.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.540
I didn't hit my bringing point, I almost did though.

43:49.540 --> 43:50.420
I did math wrong.

43:51.300 --> 43:52.140
That makes sense

43:52.140 --> 43:53.340
cause you already hit your breaking point.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.980
Yeah, I'm two away though.

43:54.980 --> 43:56.500
But you did lose five grip.

43:56.500 --> 44:00.060
So Luke, I need a fight flight freeze.

44:00.060 --> 44:03.060
I'll go top in that order flight flight freeze.

44:03.060 --> 44:05.140
And freeze is a one.

44:05.140 --> 44:05.980
Five.

44:05.980 --> 44:06.820
What is that?

44:06.820 --> 44:07.640
That's fight.

44:07.640 --> 44:08.480
The top answer?

44:09.200 --> 44:10.040
So what do you do?

44:10.040 --> 44:11.040
Punch him in the nose.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.680
Julius thinks he's this guy has to shut his mouth

44:15.680 --> 44:17.080
and he's gonna just like go

44:17.080 --> 44:19.720
and like put his hand over his mouth and nose.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.680
Oh my God, okay.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.560
You do so.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.280
Roll unarmed combat

44:24.280 --> 44:26.480
and he's gonna roll at a massive disadvantage

44:26.480 --> 44:31.080
because his arms are behind his back with his wrists tied.

44:31.080 --> 44:31.920
Not all of them.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.600
He had a 41 on a 60.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.960
And with the success,

44:35.960 --> 44:38.760
Julius Summers has his hands over the mouth

44:38.760 --> 44:40.860
and nose of Greg Gottel.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.320
Cal was thinking something very, very similar

44:44.320 --> 44:46.040
as he was running up those stairs.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.940
And so he's trying to grab some duct tape

44:47.940 --> 44:49.440
from his utility drawer in the kitchen

44:49.440 --> 44:50.720
cause this seems untenable.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.320
Julius, Julius, be careful.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.160
Like don't kill him.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.280
Like just make sure he passes out,

44:54.280 --> 44:55.120
but then you gotta stop.

44:55.120 --> 44:56.180
Make sure that mouth stays shut.

44:56.180 --> 44:57.020
Help him.

44:57.020 --> 44:57.840
Help him.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.720
Julius nods.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.560
What are you doing back?

44:59.560 --> 45:00.380
What am I seeing?

45:00.380 --> 45:03.240
You are seeing Julius like plugging the nose

45:03.240 --> 45:05.740
and mouth of this dude.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.100
Stevie grabs and is like,

45:09.100 --> 45:11.060
not the nose, not the nose, just the mouth.

45:11.060 --> 45:12.020
He's not budging.

45:12.020 --> 45:12.840
Nope.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.680
She can't stop him.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.660
I put my hands over both of Julius's hands

45:16.660 --> 45:20.260
and my goal is to, when I feel Gottel passing out,

45:20.260 --> 45:21.580
I wanna pull him away.

45:21.580 --> 45:22.660
We can't kill him, Julius.

45:22.660 --> 45:23.620
We can't kill him.

45:23.620 --> 45:26.060
If we kill him, that God thing will pop into one of us

45:26.060 --> 45:27.060
and then we're fucked.

45:27.060 --> 45:28.260
Don't kill him, Julius.

45:28.260 --> 45:30.200
I'll be right there.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.040
Julius nods.

45:31.040 --> 45:34.560
Okay, let's get a human role here

45:34.560 --> 45:37.320
from Beck Wilder to see if you can feel

45:37.320 --> 45:41.280
or you can go for one of the like first aid type roles

45:41.280 --> 45:42.100
if you have that.

45:42.100 --> 45:43.000
I'm gonna take the human.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.080
Okay.

45:44.080 --> 45:44.920
I pass.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.140
12 on a 40 human.

45:46.140 --> 45:49.800
Okay, so as Cal Colorado comes running back down the stairs

45:49.800 --> 45:52.600
with duct tape and Stevie is trying to like push

45:52.600 --> 45:55.480
at the arms and hands of Julius Summers,

45:55.480 --> 45:58.220
you feel on the arms of Julius

45:58.220 --> 46:02.380
the kind of release of consciousness from Greg Gottel.

46:02.380 --> 46:04.340
And she's like, that's super bad for you.

46:04.340 --> 46:05.180
What are you doing?

46:05.180 --> 46:07.740
We got to, it's not as bad as like death though.

46:07.740 --> 46:08.580
It's okay.

46:08.580 --> 46:10.280
And I'm trying to pull.

46:11.700 --> 46:12.540
It's okay.

46:12.540 --> 46:14.580
Cal's got a big thing of duct tape stripped out

46:14.580 --> 46:15.740
and he's like, okay, okay.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.460
Real quick, Julius, move your hands.

46:17.460 --> 46:18.300
I'm gonna tape them.

46:18.300 --> 46:19.460
One, two.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.740
And I started rapping and rapping and rapping.

46:22.740 --> 46:25.500
Yo, yo, yo, my name is Cal.

46:25.500 --> 46:28.060
My name is Cal Colorado and I'm here to say

46:28.740 --> 46:30.660
that you're gonna wrap your mouth in a serious way.

46:32.180 --> 46:35.860
All right, you've got duct tape all around the mouth

46:35.860 --> 46:40.860
and jaw and neck of Greg Gottel and he is unconscious.

46:41.500 --> 46:44.100
And Stevie is like, let's at least like, you know,

46:44.100 --> 46:45.740
make him comfortable again.

46:45.740 --> 46:47.580
Can we please like, this is.

46:47.580 --> 46:49.740
And you see like she's pleading with you.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.580
Yeah, no, of course.

46:51.580 --> 46:53.020
Let's get him to the couch downstairs.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.820
I just want to apologize that I hit your God brother.

46:55.820 --> 46:59.660
No, it's, it was just a reflex like he was waking up.

46:59.660 --> 47:00.900
Sorry, your mayor brother.

47:00.900 --> 47:02.080
Your mayor God brother.

47:02.080 --> 47:02.920
Your brother.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.200
Your little mayor God brother.

47:05.540 --> 47:06.980
She's just staring at the ground.

47:06.980 --> 47:08.100
Looks up at both of you.

47:08.100 --> 47:08.940
It's fine.

47:08.940 --> 47:10.380
Let's get him secured down here.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.220
How?

47:11.220 --> 47:12.060
Yeah, I don't know.

47:12.060 --> 47:12.880
Sit on him.

47:13.880 --> 47:14.840
You've got that duct tape.

47:14.840 --> 47:17.540
Could we like, is there like a something sturdy down here?

47:17.540 --> 47:20.060
We could just duct tape, duct tape.

47:20.060 --> 47:21.220
I've got some tie downs.

47:21.220 --> 47:26.220
I've got some tie down straps and in the utility closet,

47:27.180 --> 47:30.940
I could, we can, we can strap them to this couch.

47:30.940 --> 47:31.860
Yeah, let's do it.

47:31.860 --> 47:33.980
Julie's is just kind of staring off.

47:33.980 --> 47:35.580
Okay, let's be gentle.

47:35.580 --> 47:40.040
And Stevie is helping you use all of this roll of duct tape.

47:40.040 --> 47:40.880
Yeah.

47:40.880 --> 47:43.600
And all these straps and you use the rest of the roll

47:43.600 --> 47:45.420
of duct tape to secure the.

47:45.420 --> 47:46.900
I don't think we need the duct tape that

47:46.900 --> 47:48.060
she wants comfort, right?

47:48.420 --> 47:50.100
It's, I just.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.180
As they're like putting on more and more duct tape

47:52.180 --> 47:53.980
staring at you as you're like, I'm not sure about that.

47:53.980 --> 47:57.420
They're like, but if they get out, they want the comfort,

47:57.420 --> 48:01.340
but Stevie is very worried about what happens if.

48:01.340 --> 48:02.180
Yeah.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.020
Yeah, understandable.

48:03.020 --> 48:06.140
So I am gonna crank these straps kind of hard

48:06.140 --> 48:07.820
and he starts ratcheting down.

48:07.820 --> 48:08.740
I gotta go.

48:08.740 --> 48:10.580
She just gonna walk upstairs.

48:10.580 --> 48:12.420
Like this is becoming a lot.

48:12.420 --> 48:13.740
Yeah, yeah.

48:13.740 --> 48:15.220
Could you, could you check on the T?

48:15.220 --> 48:17.220
Yes, absolutely.

48:17.220 --> 48:18.260
Anyone else?

48:19.420 --> 48:23.520
All right, I'll take your silence as a no T answer.

48:23.520 --> 48:27.420
But everyone is just dazed as, it's been a long.

48:27.420 --> 48:29.460
Stevie ratchet also.

48:29.460 --> 48:32.420
Stevie in the front right door of the fridge.

48:32.420 --> 48:34.940
There's some energy drink, the kind you like Beck.

48:34.940 --> 48:36.660
Sorry, the cat is making it sound like

48:36.660 --> 48:38.020
I'm touching my mic stand.

48:38.020 --> 48:39.380
It's not me, it's the cat.

48:40.340 --> 48:41.180
So we've got him ratcheted down.

48:41.180 --> 48:43.100
The cat touched my mic stand.

48:43.100 --> 48:44.960
I swear it wasn't me dude.

48:44.960 --> 48:47.760
If he's ratcheted down Beck would happily go upstairs

48:47.760 --> 48:49.280
to grab an energy drink.

48:49.280 --> 48:51.720
You said you liked it that time you came to my house

48:51.720 --> 48:52.640
three and a half years ago.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.200
So I keep some around now.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.880
Oh dude, thanks.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.280
Is it three and a half years old or?

48:58.280 --> 49:00.560
No, no, I replace them every six months.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.720
Oh dude, Cal.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.760
That's so thoughtful of you, man.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.000
You're a great camera man.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.160
Oh, thanks Cal.

49:07.160 --> 49:08.600
You're a great anchor.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.280
Thank you, I will be again.

49:10.280 --> 49:13.180
Dude, you're gonna be like the anchor

49:13.180 --> 49:14.720
after this story gets out.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.560
This is like 9-11, isn't it?

49:16.560 --> 49:17.800
Okay, so I'm picturing.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.200
Julius hears the word story and perks up.

49:20.200 --> 49:21.660
I was picturing this whole time.

49:21.660 --> 49:23.940
They're having this conversation in the kitchen

49:23.940 --> 49:26.920
and Julius is just standing at the top of the stairs

49:26.920 --> 49:29.280
out of view from them listening

49:29.280 --> 49:31.400
and just picking at his face.

49:31.400 --> 49:32.800
Oh God.

49:32.800 --> 49:35.280
In the darkness of the basement stairwell.

49:35.280 --> 49:38.520
One hand typing barely legible notes

49:38.520 --> 49:40.800
on what is gonna go into the edit

49:40.800 --> 49:43.040
and the other just peeling skin.

49:43.040 --> 49:44.440
You do hear at that moment.

49:45.040 --> 49:46.960
Julius, what do you like to drink?

49:46.960 --> 49:48.040
Energy drink.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.900
There's a whole six pack.

49:49.900 --> 49:51.200
Would you like some?

49:51.200 --> 49:54.240
He kind of wanders over there, still doing both things.

49:54.240 --> 49:58.840
And now that you have Greg Godel secured in the basement

49:58.840 --> 50:02.940
and the four of you are sharing caffeine in the kitchen.

50:02.940 --> 50:04.520
Let's call that ambulance, huh?

50:04.520 --> 50:05.580
It's close enough.

50:06.520 --> 50:09.760
Yeah, let's just walk with our tea and energy drinks.

50:09.760 --> 50:10.680
It's a nice day.

50:10.680 --> 50:11.880
I don't have insurance.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.800
It is nice being back in the city.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.480
Where everyone knows your name.

50:16.480 --> 50:20.160
Julius sniffs as in like, it's nice to smell the air again.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.920
Does he smell regular air or is it?

50:22.920 --> 50:25.120
It is exactly what you think it smells like.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.200
Uh-oh.

50:26.200 --> 50:29.960
Or that could mean, I don't know what that means.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.000
I don't know what that means.

50:31.000 --> 50:31.880
What do you think it smells like?

50:31.880 --> 50:33.180
It's why I asked, I don't know.

50:33.180 --> 50:35.160
Yeah, it smells like that.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.200
Okay, he's happily walking to the hospital,

50:38.200 --> 50:40.720
peeling his skin and losing blood.

50:40.720 --> 50:44.200
No, we're, as you like you walk out the front door

50:44.840 --> 50:45.680
and just start strolling down there

50:45.680 --> 50:47.000
and we're like, we grab you by the shoulders

50:47.000 --> 50:48.740
and we're like, no, no, no, no, get in the can van,

50:48.740 --> 50:50.280
get in the can van.

50:50.280 --> 50:51.980
Come on, we're driving you.

50:51.980 --> 50:53.240
He allows it.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.800
Do I stay here?

50:54.800 --> 50:56.140
Is that okay or?

50:56.140 --> 50:57.900
Yeah, Stevie, you stay here.

50:57.900 --> 50:59.520
We're gonna get him some medical attention

50:59.520 --> 51:01.240
and then as soon as they've got them checked up,

51:01.240 --> 51:04.640
I think we're pulling an all-nighter down at the station.

51:04.640 --> 51:07.720
Okay, all right, well, you have my number, so.

51:07.720 --> 51:08.560
Of course.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.680
If anything happens there, let me know.

51:10.680 --> 51:11.680
No can intern.

51:11.680 --> 51:16.080
I'll let you know if anything happens on my end, obviously.

51:16.920 --> 51:19.680
You know your number one job here, right?

51:19.680 --> 51:22.300
Don't let Greg kill himself.

51:22.300 --> 51:24.400
Right, yes, obvious, I mean, yeah.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.620
Stevie, if I had more time,

51:25.620 --> 51:28.020
I would help you move my collection of antique steak knives

51:28.020 --> 51:30.360
out of the basement, but we've really got to get,

51:33.880 --> 51:36.560
really got to get out of here and get him to the hospital

51:36.560 --> 51:38.000
and then get this thing cut.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.320
I think you can handle that, right?

51:39.320 --> 51:43.160
Hard cut to the steak knife collection in the basement

51:43.160 --> 51:46.680
and swift cut back to you guys waving goodbye.

51:47.920 --> 51:51.580
Here's a glass case full of like all these blocks of knives.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.960
Full fucking wooden sets.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.520
But there is a thing that says, do not touch on us.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.360
Oh, that might help.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.200
There you go.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.020
That might help.

52:03.880 --> 52:04.720
Okay.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.280
I feel so much better, Julius says,

52:06.280 --> 52:08.440
after spending some time in the hospital.

52:10.320 --> 52:13.000
I'm glad, says Cal, Colorado,

52:13.000 --> 52:15.760
after sitting in the waiting room playing with TikTok.

52:15.760 --> 52:19.340
I need you to stay overnight, says the nurse.

52:19.340 --> 52:20.180
Oh.

52:20.180 --> 52:21.880
Julius winks and agrees.

52:21.880 --> 52:22.720
All right.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.920
Guess it's you and me on the edit, Beck.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.760
And the two of you.

52:31.760 --> 52:34.480
Like we're standing by his hospital bed while she says this?

52:34.480 --> 52:35.320
Yeah.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.160
Or like in the emergency room,

52:36.160 --> 52:37.800
they just got him in the hallway on a bed.

52:37.840 --> 52:39.920
Like ma'am, there is some news tonight.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.360
Do you happen to recognize me?

52:41.360 --> 52:43.060
Cal, Colorado city action news.

52:43.060 --> 52:43.900
And I wink.

52:44.880 --> 52:45.720
49.

52:46.840 --> 52:47.880
So yeah.

52:47.880 --> 52:48.720
Yeah.

52:48.720 --> 52:49.560
Oh, oh yeah.

52:49.560 --> 52:50.520
Call Colorado.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.600
Um, well, as you know, the news never sleeps.

52:52.600 --> 52:53.440
Of course not.

52:53.440 --> 52:54.720
But this man needs to,

52:54.720 --> 52:57.840
his face is broken in like multiple places.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.140
We need to do CAT scans.

52:59.140 --> 53:00.400
We need to do X-rays.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.520
We need to draw blood.

53:01.520 --> 53:02.520
Sounds expensive.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.300
Let's just give me a Tylenol.

53:04.300 --> 53:05.960
Or, you know, something stronger.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.040
Anything that can.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.840
Let's just get him back on his feet for now.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.040
And then like we can bring him back.

53:10.040 --> 53:11.160
We'll bring him back in the morning.

53:11.160 --> 53:12.000
Right, yes.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.680
I'll be back for sure.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.040
1 p.m. at the latest.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.000
She starts laughing.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.040
She's like, I gotta be honest with you.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.020
I'm not sure if legally I'm allowed to let him leave.

53:21.020 --> 53:21.860
No, that makes a lot of sense.

53:21.860 --> 53:23.760
I'm not sure if you're legally allowed to make me stay.

53:23.760 --> 53:27.180
Okay, that's scary and fine.

53:27.180 --> 53:28.760
Why did you come here?

53:28.760 --> 53:30.080
For something quick.

53:30.080 --> 53:31.160
It's the hospital.

53:31.160 --> 53:33.400
If you want something quick, go to Walgreens.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.520
You got better stuff than Walgreens?

53:35.520 --> 53:38.200
Yeah, but we're gonna need to book you overnight

53:38.200 --> 53:40.000
to put fluids in you.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.520
This is Cal, Colorado.

53:41.520 --> 53:42.800
If you could just help us out.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.000
We will have him back in the morning.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.880
But he refuses to not be a part of the news.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.800
We're just asking, you can clean up his cuts

53:51.800 --> 53:53.400
and make sure that.

53:53.400 --> 53:54.600
I wanna try a persuade role on him.

53:54.600 --> 53:55.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:55.680 --> 53:57.440
And go ahead and assist.

53:57.440 --> 54:01.080
You can add a plus 20, the two of you, if you succeed.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.200
Yep, success.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.480
So plus 20.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.240
Oh, and he already succeeded.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.440
I passed my persuade.

54:07.440 --> 54:08.280
Oh.

54:08.280 --> 54:09.360
A 46 on a 50.

54:09.360 --> 54:12.320
That plus 40, which puts me over, and I fail.

54:12.320 --> 54:13.160
Oh.

54:13.160 --> 54:13.980
Oh.

54:13.980 --> 54:14.820
Oh.

54:14.820 --> 54:15.660
Oh.

54:15.660 --> 54:16.480
Oh.

54:16.480 --> 54:17.320
Oh.

54:17.320 --> 54:18.160
We are way too convinced.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.000
The dice work in the worst way ever.

54:20.000 --> 54:20.840
What a shame.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.520
She's like, uh, yeah, whatever you guys want.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.320
And you're all like, he should stay here.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.160
Oh.

54:25.160 --> 54:25.980
Oh.

54:25.980 --> 54:26.820
Oh.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.880
Those are pain pills, you're putting them in pain.

54:28.880 --> 54:32.120
Yeah, I can do like a steroid shot.

54:32.120 --> 54:34.160
I can give you half a D6, I guess,

54:34.160 --> 54:35.400
if you're not gonna stay overnight.

54:36.220 --> 54:37.060
Half a D6 plus one.

54:37.060 --> 54:37.880
Not a chance.

54:37.880 --> 54:38.720
Wink.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.800
Half of three is two.

54:44.160 --> 54:47.040
So yeah, you go up from two hit points to four hit points,

54:47.040 --> 54:48.880
which is quite substantial.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.040
Plenty of hit points.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.520
Well then unfortunately we do get to the point

54:51.520 --> 54:53.540
where we're looking at you only two hit points better,

54:53.540 --> 54:55.400
and we're like, maybe you should stay.

54:55.400 --> 55:00.400
I thought you would be better.

55:01.680 --> 55:05.200
It's just the fact that a couple of the cuts

55:05.960 --> 55:08.480
have now been like pushed together with a bandaid,

55:08.480 --> 55:11.440
like the kind of butterfly kind of holding

55:11.440 --> 55:12.400
the pieces together.

55:12.400 --> 55:15.880
And then currently you've got fluids going into you,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.640
and you've also, they're gonna do blood work.

55:18.640 --> 55:20.320
No they're not, he gets up.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.160
Okay.

55:21.160 --> 55:26.000
And I take these two a day, twice a day.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.500
You know, your nurse always gives you your medicine.

55:28.500 --> 55:29.960
I'll be back tomorrow.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.200
It's just a little something something

55:31.200 --> 55:32.920
from our personal stash.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.640
You all succeeded on your persuade checks.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.960
She's like, okay, here's some of the good stuff.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.880
And?

55:39.880 --> 55:42.200
Two a day, twice a day keeps the demons away.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.080
Again, like I said, we'll be back 1 p.m.

55:45.080 --> 55:45.940
two at the latest.

55:45.940 --> 55:48.040
To get him, you know, the full treatment.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.240
Maybe like 24 hours from now,

55:50.240 --> 55:52.520
if he does want to stay up till nine to watch his segment.

55:52.520 --> 55:53.360
I don't know.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.200
We'll see, but.

55:54.200 --> 55:57.240
I can watch the segment from the hospital.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.200
That's remarkably mature of you.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.320
Let's fucking go.

56:00.320 --> 56:03.840
Vroom vroom, the can-van speeds.

56:03.840 --> 56:06.040
As you're heading out down the hallway,

56:06.040 --> 56:09.720
you hear a man hiccup and shit his pants at the same time.

56:09.720 --> 56:11.720
Julia says, hm, cucumbers?

56:11.720 --> 56:12.720
That could be a story.

56:12.720 --> 56:15.240
Camera goes right back to the vroom vroom of the can-van

56:15.240 --> 56:20.240
as you head back down to the city action news HQ.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.300
We see the columns, we see the glass,

56:22.300 --> 56:25.040
we see the beautiful moss, we saw the landscaping,

56:25.040 --> 56:28.640
we see the marble-less floor as you enter.

56:28.640 --> 56:29.720
I miss that marble.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.440
It's the three of you, rolling in, ready to go,

56:33.440 --> 56:34.960
as you hit the edit bay.

56:34.960 --> 56:38.440
We are rolling Julius in in a hospital wheelchair.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.160
Oh, nice, wheelchair to go.

56:40.160 --> 56:42.020
We bump the doors open with his legs.

56:42.020 --> 56:44.800
As Julius is- Roll a date for it?

56:44.800 --> 56:45.640
As Julius is-

56:45.640 --> 56:49.460
I run.

56:51.120 --> 56:53.520
As Julius is wheeled in, he's thinking,

56:53.520 --> 56:54.840
but he says it out loud.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.400
He's like, I'll be Raylan now.

56:56.400 --> 56:57.240
Raylan?

56:57.720 --> 56:58.560
It's your-

56:58.560 --> 57:00.920
That's my family's name,

57:00.920 --> 57:03.360
but they've always considered me not a Raylan.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.680
Julius, remember what I was telling Stevie.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.300
You don't have to be your family.

57:07.300 --> 57:08.880
You can be your own man.

57:08.880 --> 57:09.720
A newsman.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.280
Julius nods.

57:11.280 --> 57:12.640
After what we've been through,

57:12.640 --> 57:14.800
I definitely feel closer to you guys.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.480
I mean, yeah, that was the craziest thing

57:17.480 --> 57:18.920
that's ever happened in my life.

57:18.920 --> 57:20.720
That was the third craziest thing

57:20.720 --> 57:22.200
that's ever happened in my life.

57:22.200 --> 57:23.480
Let's show the people.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.600
Wait, what, Cal?

57:26.840 --> 57:29.040
Vivica pops out of the editing bay

57:29.040 --> 57:32.080
and is like doing a big stretch of her shoulders

57:32.080 --> 57:33.960
and then pops her knuckles.

57:33.960 --> 57:35.560
And she's like, oh, hey guys, sorry.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.720
I'm actually heading out for the night pretty beat,

57:37.720 --> 57:40.020
but do you want me to take care of anything

57:40.020 --> 57:40.960
for you guys before I go?

57:40.960 --> 57:41.800
Or are you good to go?

57:41.800 --> 57:42.940
Do we need her help on this

57:42.940 --> 57:44.400
or do we know what we're doing?

57:44.400 --> 57:46.760
I think Beck would know enough.

57:46.760 --> 57:47.920
He's not an editor,

57:47.920 --> 57:50.040
but he would know enough about how to edit.

57:50.040 --> 57:53.440
Like he normally does want Vivica there to do the editing.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.280
Sure.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.960
But I think, I look at Cal and Julius,

57:55.960 --> 57:58.240
I think maybe we should handle this one

57:58.240 --> 57:59.760
or do you want like a professional

57:59.760 --> 58:00.600
set of eyes on this? She gives you

58:00.600 --> 58:01.420
an inquisitive look.

58:01.420 --> 58:02.260
She's like, what do you mean?

58:02.260 --> 58:04.080
Is it anything like super intense?

58:04.080 --> 58:06.200
Vivica, how did you get your job here?

58:06.200 --> 58:08.760
Oh, that is a big question.

58:08.760 --> 58:11.860
Yeah, no, I went to school, applied, intern,

58:11.860 --> 58:14.120
got the job, kept moving up, started getting paid,

58:14.120 --> 58:15.660
get health insurance next year.

58:15.660 --> 58:18.040
Have you ever, oh, yes.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.480
So you're what, 10 years in?

58:19.480 --> 58:20.320
Yeah.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
Have you ever worked for the Godel company?

58:26.120 --> 58:26.960
No.

58:26.960 --> 58:28.300
You might want to see this.

58:28.300 --> 58:29.140
Okay, yeah.

58:29.140 --> 58:31.260
I mean, if you've got some juicy goss,

58:31.260 --> 58:33.240
I'll get the tea brewing.

58:33.240 --> 58:35.880
Vivica, do you want to edit the biggest news story

58:35.880 --> 58:37.200
since 9-11?

58:37.200 --> 58:40.080
She gives you just like the biggest eyes,

58:40.080 --> 58:42.840
kind of brows waggling about.

58:42.840 --> 58:45.200
I bet you would, but we have to do this one on our own.

58:45.200 --> 58:48.240
Oh, you can't just leave me hanging like that, what?

58:49.240 --> 58:50.080
Vivica, I forgot.

58:50.080 --> 58:51.960
There's something that you can't know about

58:51.960 --> 58:53.200
that's in this footage.

58:53.200 --> 58:54.360
That is actually what I forgot.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.200
She can't know about the God shit.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.160
Fuck you guys.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.520
And she grabs the door and heads back into the editing bay.

59:01.520 --> 59:03.020
She goes back into the editing bay.

59:03.020 --> 59:04.440
She's like, I'm going to edit this.

59:04.440 --> 59:05.840
If you guys are going to be weird about it,

59:05.840 --> 59:06.960
I want to see.

59:06.960 --> 59:11.400
Oh, how do we decide if we can trust her?

59:11.400 --> 59:14.120
Guys, Vivica is like one of my best friend,

59:14.120 --> 59:15.520
coworker friends here.

59:15.520 --> 59:16.760
She's always had my back.

59:16.800 --> 59:19.440
And I mean, obviously she's never seen anything like this,

59:19.440 --> 59:20.280
but-

59:20.280 --> 59:21.960
Is she like religious?

59:21.960 --> 59:23.360
I don't think so.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.920
They're like looking in through the glass door

59:25.920 --> 59:27.880
that's kind of tinted at her.

59:27.880 --> 59:30.040
And she's like bringing the computer back up.

59:30.040 --> 59:32.320
She's getting the programs going, yeah.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.600
And she's good at what she does.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.560
I mean, we're going to have a good looking piece

59:35.560 --> 59:37.440
if she's ever fingerprints on it.

59:37.440 --> 59:40.200
Julius was thinking about like us editing it

59:40.200 --> 59:42.920
versus the quality of having her help us.

59:42.920 --> 59:43.760
And it's gotta be-

59:43.760 --> 59:46.280
It's a charming amateurism versus...

59:46.760 --> 59:48.440
It might be the individual life,

59:48.440 --> 59:51.200
but it will be a greatly edited segment, right?

59:51.200 --> 59:53.040
Here's the deal though, guys.

59:53.040 --> 59:55.720
I could just like, I think I should just like

59:55.720 --> 59:58.800
not give her the time codes for the stuff with Fox.

59:58.800 --> 59:59.640
Perfect.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.840
If you can pre-scan the footage and yeah.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.680
Yeah.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.240
So that's in the earlier episodes,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.520
that's one of Beck's things is that he has like an eidetic,

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.320
is an eidetic memory of like the footage that he has

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.680
where it is on the,

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.120
he knows of the timestamps of everything you shot.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.920
So he just won't give her those timestamps.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.120
Who was making that crazy noise?

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.600
That was me.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.280
I had a bunch of spit in my mouth from burping a bunch

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.320
and I had to swallow it.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.440
We have got to get Luke to a hospital, guys.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.400
Hey, you know what I love about our podcast

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.840
and what I don't understand about fucking NPR?

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.160
Oh no.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.320
Is the, is there liberal nonsense?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.400
No, they obviously have gone for a certain fidelity

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.240
in their mics that picks up every bit of moisture

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.240
in your mouth or lack thereof and everybody is just like,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.280
it's so hard to listen to sometimes.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.280
It's me hard to listen to.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.600
Yeah, I get hard listening to it sometimes.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.160
That's why NPR stands for National Boner Radio.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.320
What?

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.280
NPR.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.320
NPR, National Boner Radio,

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.920
that would be a good shock shock.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.920
You're listening to NPR with penis in the clit.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.720
I'm the clit.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720
I'm the clit.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.160
All right, Vivica, let's edit this thing.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.200
We've got a long night ahead of us.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.040
I bet.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:34.880
I'll be right back.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880
Would you all like some coffee?

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.720
Yes.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.440
Cal, you follow, like the camera follows Cal

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.640
to the little office kitchen

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.280
and he makes everybody some coffee.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.960
He knows how many creams Beck takes or doesn't.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.000
He grabs a handful of creamers and sugar

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.520
for everybody else who he doesn't know

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.160
and he stops by his office

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.720
and he pours a hefty belt of whiskey into his.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.520
In the editing bay, Beck cracks his knuckles

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.440
and he says, okay, first it's like a,

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.680
there's a jackalip that I fall on.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.600
You can, there's footage of that

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.080
at four minutes and three seconds.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.240
And then there's also the time

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.040
when the god turtle fell off the stool

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.080
and that's at seven minutes and eight seconds.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.000
Oh, and there's also the machine that heals people.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.640
That's at three minutes and five seconds in

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.080
and he's running down the list.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.600
Julius is looking at his notes

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.120
and it's just Z a bunch of times

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.880
that he's like, he puts his phone down

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.080
and he's just like helping rattle off

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.520
other things that happened.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.640
The children who look like animals

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.240
but are also humans, that's it.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280
Go ahead and roll.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.800
Did she crit fail a grip roll?

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.640
Yep.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.460
We're fucking dumb.

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:33.640
We should have kicked her out.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.920
That's an 88 on the grip roll.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.960
God.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.880
Vivica, are you with me?

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:43.040
You see Vivica just staring blankly at the monitors.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.800
We may have made a mistake

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.720
onboarding Vivica to this project.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.440
I kind of forgot that this stuff is psyche damaging.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.320
Welcome to Godal's gorge.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.280
Yeah, Vivica.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.720
Welcome to Godal's gorge.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.720
["My life is great and it's all my fault"]

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.720
["My life is great and it's all my fault"]
